(Received 19 July 1978)
The crystal structure of erythrocruorin has been refined by constrained crystallographic refinement at 1.4 A resolution in the following ligand states: aquomet (Fe3+, high spin), cyanomet (Fe3+, low spin), deoxy (Fez+, high spin) and at this resolution is better carbonmonoxy (Fe 2 + , low spin). The final R-value than 0.19 for each of these models. The positional errors of the co-ordinates are less than 0.1 A. The root-mean-square differences between the deoxygenated and the ligated erythrocruorin are about 0.1 A, being largest for cyanomet-erythrocruorin. The changes in tertiary structures propagate from the location of primary events and often fade out at the molecular surface. Helix E passing the distal side of the haem group is affected most by the direct contact with the ligand bound to the haem iron. Steric hindrance by the distal residue IleE 11 forces the cyanide and carbonmonoxide ligands to bind at an angle to the haem axis. The strain at the ligand is partially relieved by movement of the haem deeper into the haem pocket and rearrangement of neighbouring residues. The differences in iron location tyith respect to the mean haem plane are spindependent but unexpectedly small (the largest value is 0.15 L% between deoxy and carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin). Spin state changes seem to have little influence on the porphyrin stereochemistry; it is determined primarily by the chemical properties of the ligand and its interaction with the haem and the globin. These non-covalent interactions are largely responsible for the initiation of the structural changes on ligand binding.

1. Introduction
Haemoglobin is one of the best understood allosteric proteins in terms of a structural explanation of its co-operative and allosteric properties (for reviews see Perutz, 1976; Baldwin, 1975; Edelstein, 1975). Perutz has proposed a detailed molecular mechanism for its co-operative oxygen binding effect (Perutz, 1970,1972), to a large extent based on X-ray diffraction studies. The large quaternary structural change between the low-affinity deoxy and high-affinity oxy state is induced by far smaller tertiary structural changes (Perutz, 1976). While the former is well-established, considerable controversy exists concerning the mode of triggering the latter changes in the tertiary structure of a single subunit. On the one hand, these alterations are ascribed to the change in spin state of the iron (Perutz, 1972) and to the variation in the distance 309

between the proximal histidine and the mean plane of the porphyrin (Perutz et al., 1974). On the other hand, the major role in the trigger process is ascribed to the steric interactions between the globin and the ligand at the sixth co-ordination position of the iron (Edelstein & Gibson, 1975; Little & Ibers, 1974). In order to confidently define these tertiary structural changes and their origin by X-ray diffraction, high-resolution refinement has to be applied. Due to the better crystalline order, monomeric haemoglobins and myoglobins allow a more accurate structure determination. Recently, the refined structures of met-, deoxy- and carbonmonoxy-myoglobin have been reported (Takano, 1977a,b; Norvell et al., 1975). We have been engaged in the refinement of erythrocruorin in various ligation states. This particular monomeric haemoglobin III from the insect Chironomus thummi thummi exhibits marked Bohr effects for oxygen and carbon monoxide (Gersonde et al., 1972 : Sick & Gersonde, 1974; Steffens et al., 1977). It can therefore undergo pH-dependent structural changes controlled by the sixth ligand (Gersonde et al., 1972), which makes this protein an ideal model for investigating the kind of structural changes that occur within a sub&it when binding different ligands to the haem iron. The isomorphous crystal structures of the met-, deoxy- and carbonmonoxyerythrocruorins have been determined at 2.5 i% resolution (Huber et al., 1970,1971). We have extended these studies by increasing the resolution to I.4 .& including the ligand form cyanomet and performing crystallographic refinements on each of these structures. Recently, we succeeded in preparing and stabilizing the physiologically important oxy derivative (Weber et al., 1978). By a comparison of the various isomorphous ligation forms, comprising representatives for both low-spin and high-spin states in two different oxidation states of the iron (ferrous, ferric), we are able to gain additional insight into the triggering of structural transitions.

2. Experimental Procedure
(a) Preparation

of crystals with diflerent ligands

The various ligated forms of erythrocruorin form isomorphous crystals. This allows preparations using crystalline material initially available in the aquomet form. All crystals that were used for the present studies were taken from batches prepared several years ago (Huber et al., 1970) usipg known procedures (Braun et al., 1968; Huber et al., 1964). The for 3.75 M-phosphate buffer original 3.75 M-sulphate buffer (pH 7.0) was exchanged (pH 7.0), which was used throughout all further experiments. Table 1 summarizes the preparation procedure for the various ligated forms. The met crystals were directly suitable for X-ray investigation of the aquomet form. The second ferric species, cyanomet, was quite easy to prepare because no step of reduction to the ferrous state was necessary. Met crystals were transferred to 3.75 Mphosphate buffer containing 0.01 M-KCN. The crystals immediately changed their colour from brown to dark red. This alteration in the spectral properties was checked quantitatively after X-ray data collection by dissolving the crystals in 1 M-phosphate buffer without KCN and taking individual absorption spectra. The typical spectrum of the cyanomet form (Antonini & Brunori, 1971) was obtained. The reduction of met crystals to deoxy crystals was performed in a slightly different way from that described by Huber et aE. (1970). In order to work in an oxygen-free environment, the buffer was deaerated under reduced pressure and then transferred to a glove-box filled with nitrogen. There, sodium dithionite was added to the 3.75 M-phosphate buffer to a final concn of 0.1 M. Met crystals were put into this buffer for 30 min and then transferred to glass capillaries together with a small amount of the buffer. The reduction of the met crystals to the deoxy form appeared to happen instantaneously, as could be

seen from the change of their colour from brown to bright red. Possible braces qf oxygen would have been absorbed by the high excess of dithionite. After collecting X-ray intensity data from these deoxy crystals, they were used for comrersion to the carbonmonoxy form using the procedure described by Huber et al. (1970). The capillary with the deoxy crystal was opened within the glove-box and then exposed overnight in a small vessel to carbon monoxide at a pressure of 1.04 atmospheres. This corresponds to a partial pressure of -0.8 mm Hg in the phosphate buffer, whereas the half saturation pressure of erythrocruorin is -0.02 mm Hg (Antonini & Brunori, 1971). Having taken intensity measurements, some crystals were dissolved in 1 M-phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and visible absorption spectra were recorded. In every case we observed the typical carbonmonoxy spectrum (Antonini & Brunori, 1971; Steffens, 1975), which vindicated the procedures for the preparation of both the deoxy and carbonmonoxy forms. The preparation of the unstable oxy-erythrocruorin crystals using the gaseous reducing agent, hydrogen sulphide mixed with oxygen has already been described in detail (Weber et al., 1978). (b) Data collection and processing

The crystals belong to space group P3, and the cell constants are, on average, a = b = 54.3 A and c = 35.6 8. The relative differences in lattice constants between differently liganded forms are not larger than 0-5O/& and are predominantly in the c-axis, as has been noted (Huber et aE., 1970). oyanomet, deoxy and carbonmonoxy forms, intensity data were For the aquomet, collected on a computer-controlled Siemens diffractometer, Using Ni-filtered CuKa (X-ray tube operated at 45 kV and 24 mA).

Very weak reflections were not recorded for the deoxy and been applied (Hoppe, carbonmonoxy crystals. Stationary measurements in the calculated position of the reflection maximum and its background were made, and a ratio of peak to background of 1.2 was necessary for selecting reflections for full recording. In this way, a considerable time could be saved, which still took as much as 20 min for weak amount of measuring reflections. The exposure times of the crystals varied between 150 and 800 h in total, generally being shortest for the deoxy crystals since they were used for further data collection on the carbon monoxide derivative. Within the total "life-times" of the crystals the average intensity was not allowed to decrease more than 10%. Every 30 h, 50 intense reflections distributed over the whole range of resolution were recorded. The reduction in their intensities was used to apply a linear degradation correction to the reflections recorded within the time interval 15 h before and 15 h after the control measurement. These selected reflections were also used for scaling together reflection data from different,

crystals. Besides, multiple measurements were obtained by overlapping tht: recording ranges of the different crystals and partly by scanning half of the reciprocal hemisphere instead of the sufficient third (only for cyanomet). An absorption correction was applied (Huber & Kopfmann, 1969) and the reflection data of the individual crystals were scaled together according to a method developed by one of us (Steigemann, 1974). Table 2 shows for the various forms the number of measurements, independent reflections and the quality of the intensity data as derived from averaging multiple measurements. The high crystalline order of the crystals allowed intensity data collection up to 14 A resolution throughout, within acceptable time periods. There are observable reflections at still higher scattering angles, but, the necessary amount of time to systematically scan a higher resolution range did not justify their measurement.

3. Refinement Procedure
(a) Starting set of atomic co-ordinates and cyclicul refinement of the aquomet form An initial set of atomic co-ordinates for erythrocruorin was available (Huber et al.. 1971). Since these co-ordinates were measured from the wire model in an arbitrary co-ordinate system, a transformation into the system of the unit cell had to be performed. The necessary rigid body movement was determined from an optimal (in the least-squares sense) correspondence between co-ordinates of the centres of phenyl rings measured directly in the 2.5 A isomorphous Fourier map (Huber et al., 1971) and values calculated from the available model. The transformed co-ordinates were then subjected to Diamond's (1966) model building procedure to impose standard bond lengths and angles and to introduce conformational parameters for further refinement. This correction of the model had to be done in two steps to account for the occurrence of a cis-proline at position EF3(74) (Huber et al., 1971; Huber & Steigemann, 1975). The distortions in the haem group were eliminated by use of an idealized planar porphyrin ring. In order to obtain a starting model suitable for cyclic refinement, this corrected set of co-ordinates was adjusted to the multiple isomorphous replacement electron density map at 2.5 A resolution (Huber et al., 1971) by real space refinement (Diamond, 1971,1974) varying only the conformational parameters. After four cycles the root-mean-square shift between successive cycles had dropped to 0.1 A compared to 0.7 A at the beginning. Structure factors were calculated from the resulting co-ordinates with an overall temperature factor of 10 AZ (derived from a Wilson plot), leading to R-factors of 0.34 and 0.39 within the

2.5 A and 1.4 A spheres, respectively. This was the starting model for further constrained crystallographic refinement (Huber et al., 1974; Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975) including high-resolution reflection data and abandoning isomorphous phases. The procedure consists of cyclically applied rounds of: (1) structure factor calculation from model co-ordinates ; (2) calculation of Fourier syntheses with phases from step ( 1) ; (3) real space refinement of the model in the electron density of step (2). Difference maps with amplitudes P, - P, and calculated phases are computed when automatic refinement does not proceed further and the necessary model corrections are performed manually (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975; Steigemann et al., 1976). In total, 20 full rounds of this refinement have been applied to the aquomet form with calculation of difference Fourier maps at five different stages. The general course of refinement is shown in Table 3. In the first two cycles only reflections with Bragg spacings greater than 1.7 A were included in the calculation of the electron density maps. In this way a possible negative influence of inaccurate phases in the high resolution range due to model imperfections could be excluded. For the same reason, the first Fourier map was calculated with amplitudes 1 only, whereas later on (2 F, - P,), and sometimes F,\ (3 F, - 2 F,), maps, were used to accelerate convergence (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975). Generally, the reflections within the 7.8 A sphere were excluded from the calculations because of the omission of the (within this range high) contribution of the unknown disordered solvent. No attempt has been made to use the more accurate low-resolution multiple isomorphous replacement phases, since the electron density maps had not been considerably modified by the loss of the smooth enveloping density at low resolution. Additionally, a rejection criterion has been applied to the reflection data, based on the correlation between observed and calculated amplitudes. Finally, about 4500 reflections with 2 IF, - F,\/[ F, + F,I >1*2 were excluded. These were mostly weak reflections with intensities less than 2 0 but had been included with a too high F, = 2 0. Some obviously incorrectly measured reflections could also be discarded in this way. In total, about 82% of the reflections between 7.8 A and 1.4 A were used for the refinement. From cycle 1 to cycle 10 the grid of the density maps was 0.7 A x 0.7 A x O-7 8, and was then reduced to O-4 A x 0.4 A x 0.35 A to allow a reliable adjustment of atomic radii in real space refinement (Diamond, 1971,1974). From the first cycle, the bond angles T(N-Ca-C) and the conformational angles 0 in proline residues were released. Their relative mobility (Diamond, 1971) was 0.1 compared to 4.0 for the torsional angles $,#,x in main and side-chains. After nine cycles, when the R-value had already dropped to O-24, a deviation of the peptide bonds from planarity was permitted by assigning a weight of 0.3 to the w angles. In cycle 17 (at an R-value of O-205) allowance has been made for the variation of interbond angles at the C(p) atoms of aromatic side-chains. The actual degree of mobility was controlled by varying the filter ratio (Diamond, 1971) from 5x 10e3 in the beginning to 2 x 1O-4 at the end. These values led to a reduction of the degree of freedom to 65yo and 98%, respectively, of the number of variable conformational angles. The haem group could perform a rigid body movement by having assigned to it three rotational and three translational degrees of freedom. No attachment to the globin via the proximal histidine was necessary because of the well-resolved electron density maps. Besides the free mobility of the substituents, reduced flexibility within

the porphyrin core was possible by rotation about the imaginary bonds between C-l and C-4 in each of the pyrrole rings (compare Pig. 3). At an advanced stage (R-value O-19) additional ruffling with alternate deviation of the methene atoms from the mean plane was allowed by joining the pyrrole rings with their substituents through rotation axes between the centre and the methene atoms in a chain-like fashion. In the beginning the iron atom could move only perpendicularly to the haem plane, a constraint that was released after seven cycles. The sixth ligand, H,O, was included only at this stage because of an error, but then could move freely. Atomic radii were adjusted within an F,-,-map for the first time during cycle 13, when the R-value had already dropped to 0.225. As has been noted earlier (Huber et al., 1974; Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975), additional degrees of freedom have to be included gradually to ensure proper adjustment of the parameters. From cycle 17 on, individual atomic radii were also relined in (2 F, - F,) maps. Structure factors were calculated with analytic atomic form factors (Forsyth & Wells, 1959) and an overall temperature factor of 10.5 A2 for cycles 1 to 12. From then on individual isotropic temperature factors were determined from the refined atomic radii (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975). From the effective atomic radii, the contributions arising from the form factors have to be subtracted. These "zero temperature radii" of the various atom types were adjusted dynamically by keeping the average of all resultant individual atomic temperature factors equal to the overall temperature factor. Corrections for this were read from the angular dependence of the scale factor between the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes. The atoms within the protein were always included with occupancies of either 1 or 0. The latter was necessary for invisible atoms of hydrophilic side-chains at the surface of the molecule, where they may adopt various conformations. After cycle 18, two alternate positions with occupancy 0.5 have been allowed for residues SerG14(106) and MetH17(131), since this was the only explanation for residual density in the corresponding difference Fourier map. An attempt to use the occupancies per residue determined in Diamond's (1971) program for the calculation of structure factors has never been made. An inclusion of these parameters certainly lowers the residual in reciprocal space (Takano, 1977a,b; Ladner et al., 1977), but we prefer to rely on models described with less parameters. For the description of atomic mobility, the temperature factor with fixed occupancy is, in general, sufficient. Individual temperature factors and occupancies were assigned only to solvent, molecules (treated as oxygen atoms throughout). These were calculated from the individually determined atomic radii and weights in special steps of real space refinement. The physical justification for non-unity occupancies lies in the dynamic nature of the solvent occupying the various locations only for a fraction of the time. The occupancies for the 94 located water molecules were calibrated on their average of 0.70, which had been estimated from R-value comparisons using different weights for The maximum occupancy obtained in this way was the total solvent contribution. 1.27 for a peak located 3 A from the main chain carbonyl A7. This value is still too low to attribute it to a ljhosphate ion of the buffer. The possibility of a sodium cation cannot be excluded in terms of the weight, but one would expect high co-ordination for such an ion (Bode & Schwager, 1975a,b) and that is not the case here. The high weight rather derives from the correlation between occupancy and temperature

factor, which is still high, even at 1.4 A resolution. A decrease in occupancy may be compensated to a high degree by the reduction of the temperature factor. The minimum occupancy for identified water molecules was 0.4. The probability for misinterpreting strong noise peaks as solvent molecules was very low, since peaks were selected from the difference maps only when they additionally formed reasonable distances and angles with neighbouring hydrophilic atoms and persisted during further refinement. Besides the selection of solvent molecules, the five (IP(obs)l - 1F(calc)l), a(calc) difference Fourier maps served for the correction of model errors mainly located in side-chains, as can be seen from Table 3. Two changes are of specific interest, since they are of structural relevance. Initially, the haem group had been inserted into the globin model in the same orientation as in myoglobin (Watson, 1969) and in haemoglobin (Fermi, 1975). The other less probable possibility would have been a 180" rotation of the porphyrin about the axis through the a- and y-methene atoms (compare Fig. 3), which would have brought only the asymmetrically arranged vinyl side-chains to new positions. The first difference Fourier map showed strong negative peaks at the C(/3) positions of the haem vinyls, but only one positive counterpart corresponding to a vinyl location in the alternate orientation. The C(p)-atoms, therefore, were excluded from further refinement, until the situation had clarified. Difference Fourier map 4 after cycle 15 left no doubt about the second mode of haem insertion into the globin. Only the vinyl of pyrrole II is located well; no density is present for the vinyl substituent at pyrrole I, which may rotate freely. This has been confirmed by calculations of contact distances between the globin and the vinyl C@)-atom in different orientations. No bad contact with the globin is formed over the wide range of approximately 300". The second example of difference Fourier map interpretation concerns the crystallographic corroboration of a correction (G. Buse, personal communication) of the revised sequence (Braunitzer et al., 1974), involving residues E5(56) to E7(58). The initial sequence His(EB)-Thr(Ile, E6)-Glu(E7) gave rise to considerable difficult,ies in fitting these residues to the electron density that is located at the surface of the molecule. There was no doubt that only a fraction of imidazole E5 was visible in the map and that the carboxylate of side-chain E7 had to adopt at least two conformations to be approximately consistent with the first three difference Fourier maps. Buse's check of the sequence in this region (personal communication) resulted in Glu(E5)-Thr(Ile, E6)-His(E7), i.e. an interchange of the side-chains E5 and E7. Exclusion of the atoms beyond the C(p)- a t om of both E5 and E7 led to a difference Fourier map which showed at E7 a ring-like shape of density (Fig. 1) suitable for fit,ting an imidazole ring. At side-chain E5 a weak forked density appeared, indicating the position of the Glu carboxylate. The sequence was therefore corrected as proposed and automatic refinement continued. The structural implications of this important change will be discussed later. The refinement of the aquo met form was stopped after cycle 20 with an R-value of 0.183, derived from approximately 18,100 significantly observed reflections. Inclusion of the remaining 4000 very weak reflections yielded R = 0.19. At this stage the finally calculated difference Fourier map was rather clean with a noise level of 0.1 eAm3 in the solvent region (Henderson $I Moffat, 1971) and the strongest peak 0.5 eAm3. These numbers have to be compared with the height 1.2 edA of a normal oxygen atom (B = 13 A2) that has been deliberately ignored in the structure

factor calculation for this test. The main features occurred in the solvent region showing new weakly occupied solvent molecules. Positive or negative peaks located at atomic positions of the protein indicate imperfectly determined temperature factors which might be corrected by difference Fourier techniques (Freer et al., 1975 ; Moews & Kretsinger, 1975) rather than by Fourier methods as applied here. Since no restraint such as gradual increase of temperature factor along side-chains (Deisenhofer & Steigemann, 1975) has been imposed, sharper than physically probable alterations of temperature factors between neighbouring atoms occurred. These are caused by the high correlation of their atomic radii during real space refinement in electron density maps. In general, no pairwise positive and negative peaks could be observed arising from inadequately described conformations of either main or side-chains. Exceptions are a few hydrophilic residues at the surface of the molecule with more than average mobility.

the mis-

and deoxy-erythrocruorin

The aquomet model after cycle 18 (R = 0.189) was used together with the accompanying phase set to start the cyclic refinement of both cyanomet and carbonmonoxy derivatives. Refinement of the deoxy form was initiated after cycle 3 of CO-refinement. In each case, the difference maps F, - FG were calculated using the corresponding starting models. These difference Fourier maps were primarily used for locating the main structural differences in the vicinity of the haem group. The different ligands could clearly be located from these maps. For both cyano and carbonmonoxy derivatives the positions of the ligand nitrogen and oxygen atoms, respectively, roughly coincide with the position of the water molecule of the aquo met form, w~hich is located 3 A from the iron atom and, therefore, not directly co-ordinated to it. For the cyano-erythrocruorin a shift of the whole haem group deeper into the haem pocket has been observed, similar to that of carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin, which had already been suggested in the difference Fourier map interpretation at, 2.5 A resolution (Huber et al., 1970). The equivalent difference Fourier map for deoxyerythrocruorin using the carbonmonoxy model revealed the absence of the sixth ligand and a shift of the haem in the reverse direction, i.e. to a location similar to that of the aquomet model. The largest structural changes spread over the whole molecule appeared to happen for t'he cyanomet form. These differences were located and analyzed quantitatively by independent, refinements starting from the described reference models, the refinement parameters being the same as for the aquomet refinement. The diatomic ligands CN and CO were not allowed to change their bond lengths, which have been set to 1.15 A in both cases. Apart from this constraint, the ligands could move freely, a mobility that has been accomplished in real space refinement by three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom. To emphasize the structural differences between the cyanomet and aquomet forms in the electron density distribution (3F0 - BF,)-syntheses were used during the first three cycles, which turned out to produce a slight oscillatory behaviour in the shift of atomic parameters; this also has been observed by Ladner et al. (1977). In the case of carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin, therefore, the first electron density map was based on amplitudes 2fFJCO)I - IF,,(met)l and calculated phases cr,(met). This type of density showed no considerable advantage over a simple 2F, - FG map, which was therefore used for the refinement of the deoxygenated molecule. After three rounds of refinement for each of the cyanomet, carbonmonoxy and deoxy species, difference Fourier maps were calculated and then inspected together with AF map 5 of the aquomet form to look for common model errors due to the still not quite perfect aquomet model after cycle 18. The appropriate corrections and inclusions of solvent molecules were then performed in parallel. At this stage the alternate positions for the side-chains SerG14( 106) and MetHl7( 131) were introduced in each model. Additionally, alternate positions for HisE7(58) and IleEll(62) could be located for the cyano derivative without ambiguity, as is demonstrated in Figure 2. Negative density at the imidazole ring located at the surface and corresponding positive density within the haem pocket suggests a rotation about the C(a)-C(p)bond. This movement requires a rearrangement of IleEll that is actually observabh

in the d P map (Fig. 2). A modified d F map excluding both HisE7 and 1leE 11 sidechains clearly revealed that both conformations of these side-chains are adopted. Further refinement with half weights for each of these locations confirmed these findings, which will be discussed later. Apart from this interesting structural feature, an addit,ional water molecule is present in the haem pocket, being linked to the CNnitrogen atom in a fashion similar to oxy-erythrocruorin (Weber et al., 1978). During refinement of deoxy-erythrocruorin it was determined that a water molecule is placed in the haem pocket at the same position as in aquomet but being occupied with only half weight. After incorporation of these features into the corresponding models, refinement was continued and stopped after cycles 8, 6 and 5 for cyanomet-, carbonmonoxyand deoxy-erythrocruorin, respectively, with the calculation of final difference Fourier maps.

Negative density at HisE7 position at the surface and positive density inside the haem pocket show reorientation of the imidazole ring about the C(U)-C(p) bond. The inside position of HisE7 requires a reconfiguration of IleEll. Actually, both configurations are found in equal proportions (see text). Both positions are shown.

(c) Quality

and accuracy of the structures

An easily accessible criterion for the overall quality of a protein model is the Rfactor Z/F, - F,I/.Z Fo, which has been used as general control for t'he convergence of the refinement procedure. The final R-values for each of the models of aquomet-, cyanomet-, carbonmonoxyand deoxy-erythrocruorin are contained in Table 4. Values of different resolutions are shown to enable an appropriate comparison with other structures refined at differing resolutions. For example, Takano (1977a) has reported a final R-value of 0.235 for his refinement of the metmyoglobin structureat 2 A resolution, a crystal structure that allows data collection to 1.4 A resolution (Watson, 1969). The corresponding R-factor at 2 A resolution, in our case, is 0.162 without insignificant reflections and O-166 when including them. This remarkable

difference of 0.07 may be explained by the use of reflection data to 1.4 A resolution for the erythrocruorin refinement necessarily leading to a higher accuracy in the atomic parameters. From the radial distribution of the R-factor an estimate of the overall accuracy of atomic positions may also be obtained (Luzzati, 1952). Fermi (1975) has used this approach for proteins, and it proved useful in giving an upper limit of error. For the refined erythrocruorin structures we obtained in this way an r.m.s. error of 0.15 A. The method discussed by Cruickshank (1949), which allows the determination of a lower limit for the co-ordinate errors, gives an r.m.s. error of 0.02 A. This wide range for the limits or errors could be narrowed by comparison of the structures of t'hc differently ligated forms. To reduce the influence from the major structural differences occurring in side-chains, we calculated the r.m.s. differences between the C(E)positions of deoxy and the other forms, obtaining 0.05 d for aquomet, O-07 d for

carbonmonoxy and 0.09 A for cyanomet. These values still express structural differences, and are clearly upper limits for the co-ordinate errors in the main chain. All the estimates given here are only average values and do not give any information about the errors of specific atoms, which are very hard to judge (Diamond, 1976). Certainly, there are atoms of side-chains with high temperature factors at the surface of the molecule that have less accurate co-ordinates (error up to O-4 A), and others at the inside of the molecule that are very well-defined. For the iron atom of the haem group, for example, we have made an independent test for the accuracy of its co-ordinates. As mentioned before, at the beginning of the refinement the iron could move only along the haem normal, but from cycle 9 on, it was free. In fact, for a few cycles, we maintained both modes of flexibility to monitor the influence of the increased mobility. The difference between the two positions of the iron was less than 0.03 A and may be regarded as an estimate for its positional accuracy. As an example of the quality and resolution of the electron density maps, a 2P, - F, map around the haem group using the final model is shown in Figure 3. The iron atom is clearly resolved from the liganded pyrrole nitrogen atoms.

4. Results and Discussion
(a) General
structure of the globin and the ordered solvent

The refinement of the erythrocruorin structures at 1.4 A resolution revealed atomic models with co-ordinate errors less than 0.1 A. Although the r.m.s. difference between the backbone atoms of the refined model and the model derived from 2.5 A data (Huber et al., 1971) is 0.6 A ( corresponding to an r.m.s. difference of 25" in main chain dihedral angles), the qualitative description of the molecule given by Huber et al. (1971) is correct and, therefore, is not repeated here in det,ail. Some supplementary, clarifying and new results concerning the general structure of the erythrocruorin molecule are described below. A differentiation between the various ligand forms is not necessary here. Details concerning the function of the molecule are given next. Huber et al. (1971) have pointed out' the discrepancies between the chemical analysis of the sequence (Buse et al., 1969) and their interpretation of the electron density map at 2.5 A resolution. A revised version of the sequence (Braunitzer et al., 1974) showed a closer correspondence to Huber's suggestions. The refinement of the structure at high resolution turned out to be a direct control for redetermination of the sequence (Buse, personal communication; Buse et al., 1979) contained in Figure 5. The most prominent change concerns the correction of HisE5(56)-Thr(Ile)E6(57)GluE7(58) to GluE5(56)-Thr(Ile)E6(57)-HisE7(58), which has been demonstrated above. This places a histidyl in the sequence at a posit'ion potentially able to form a distal haem contact. Even though the imidazole ring of HisE7 is not occupying the distal position, it is expelled by IleEll(62) from the haem pocket to the surface of the molecule, where it makes a polar contact to a haem propionate (see Figs 1 and 7). This is consistent with Huber'x (Huber et al., 1971) observation that IleEll(62) is acting as the distal side-chain. A possibility for the rearrangement of the HisE7 and TleEll side-chains has been found in the cyanomet form. The observed heterogeneity of the amino acids at posit'ion E6(57) (Braunitzer et al., 1974) cannot be confirmed crystallographically, but cannot, be definitely excluded. Without any doubt a threonine residue located at the surface is seen in the electron density map. If an isoleucine is present at this location, its C(yl), C(y2) positions must coincide with the

positions C(y), O(y) of threonine. Very wesk density (just above the noise level) is visible in the final difference Fourier map at a position suitable for the unlocated C(6) atom of isoleucine. Thus we may conclude that not more than 20% of the protein molecules have an isoleucine residue at E6(57). The previously reported heterogeneity of threonine and proline at position CD2(39) (Braunitzer et al.. 1974) has been resolved. The electron density is consistent. only with a threonine residue. There is still a final difference between the most recent sequence analysis (Buse, personal communication ; Buse et al., 1979) and this work. The sequence GH5 through H2 appears to be PheGH5( 114)-AlaGH6( 115)-GlyH2( 116). Unfortunately, we do not see an electron density for the C(p)- at om of AlaGH6, whose position is determined by the main chain alone. In order to explain this behaviour we would have to argue that the chain is flexible in this region. In fact, we find a temperature factor of about 15 AZ for the located atoms of GH6(115), thus this exposed area is higher t,han the overall temperature factor of 10.7 AZ, but far from the maximum value of 42 A2, which had been assigned to the worst but still located atoms in the electron density. It is highly unlikely that C(p) of GH6 should be invisible when C(a) has B == 15 A2. Thus, we assumed t'his residue to be glycine. As a final crystallographic check of t'he sequence, we calculated a difference map with the latest model excluding the residues GH2 to H3. No density appeared at t,he C(p) position of GH6. Figure 4 shows the myoglobin-like structure of erythrocruorin (Huber et al., 1969a,1971) with the helices A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H, and the connecting nonhelical segments NA, AB, CD, EF and GH. The main chain is outlined by t'he a-carbons starting at the bottom of the illustration, the side-chains by all atoms defined in the electron density. The E-amino groups of seven out of the ten lysines are tShree (A16(17), E17(68), not defined and, therefore, not shown The remaining

H21( 135)) are well-located, since they form hydrogen bonds t#o other polar side-chain atoms and located solvent molecules. Furthermore, no atomic co-ordinates have been assigned to t'he side-chain of GlnCD3(40), since it is completely invisible in the electron density. Aspartate and glutamate residues (GluE5(56), AspGH2(113), GluH4(118)), which do not form hydrogen bonds, have high temperature factors up to 42 AZ. It was interesting to see whether the distortions of helical segments reported earlier (Huber et al., 1971) were due to inaccuracies of the isomorphous map or of structural relevance. The high quality of the new model allows us to set up a reliable hydrogen bonding pattern and to use the fluctuations in the main chain conformational angles as criteria for the regularity of secondary structural elements. Figure 5 shows in a diagramatic way all hydrogen bonds formed by main chain NH and CO groups, either with each other or with nearby polar side-chains or solvent molecules. The range and type of helical sections is indicated, together with the average and standard deviation of 4 + #. Since the + and 4 angles of the main chain are highly correlated, and slight changes in one angle may be compensated by the corresponding change of the other, the fluctuation of the sum of these angles turns out to be a more sensitive signal of irregularities in helical segments. A high value for its standard deviation indicates a higher degree of distortion. The chain starts wit#h the non-helically arranged residue LeuNA3(1) followed by

SerAl(S), the first residue of the cc-helix A. This is distorted from SerAll(12) OII to a 3,, helix bent towards helix B. ProB6(20) to AspCl(31) is purely a-helical. Helix C is of type 3,, with a distortion towards u at the beginning. The segment CD starts with one turn of irregular a-helix. Then it forms the non-helical peptide to helix D, whose hydrogen bonding pattern is midway between a and 3,,. Its carboxyl end GlyD7(51) to ThrEl(52) is non-helical. a-Helix E ranging from ThrEl(52) to GluEFl (72) is very regular in the first 11 residues and less regular in its second half, with main chain angles tending to a 3 lo-type helix. At IleEll(62) the helix is kinked in a convex manner towards the haem group (see Fig. 4). The axes of the two halves form an angle of 30". A similar observation has been made for the p-chains of horse methaemoglobin (Ladner et al., 1977), where crowding at position Fl by bulky sidechains seems to offer a plausible explanation. In the present case, Fl(80) is a valine and, therefore, cannot be responsible for this effect. Here, the second half of helix E is rich in hydrophobic residues, forming one hydrophobic cluster between E, G and H that is in haem contact (see Figs 4 and 7; Table 5). The EF-corner is a reverse open turn formed by the residues GluEFl(72) to LeuEF5(76). As suggested by Huber et al. (1971), the third position is occupied by a cis-proline. The occurrence of cis-prolines at the third position of reverse open turns appears to be a general structural principle (Huber & Steigemann, 1975). Helix F actually starts at LeuEF5(76) and extends to LysF9(88) with a high degree of regularity. HisF8(87) to GlyFG4(91) forms a short distorted 310 helix. Then follows an extended conformation until t,he start of the very regular helix G. The carbonyl group of MetG16(108) forms a distorted hydrogen bond to imino group ThrGHl(112). The non-helical GH-corner is extending up to AlaH3(117), where the a-helix H starts. It consists of two segments, TABLES Interatomic

in themselves very regular, kinked at ThrH13(127) by about 35". At GlyHl6( 130) the helix deviates from a-helical conformation to be distorted to one turn of 31, helix at the carboxyl end of the polypeptide chain. This analysis confirms and completes in a quantitative manner the list of distortions observed by Huber et al. (1971). Finally, we may conclude that the distortions in helical segments are structurally relevant. They occur where further interactions like the formation of forked hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic clusters lead to a net gain in the free energy of the molecule at some decrease of regularity in the helical hydrogen bonds. The helices contain very few straight NH-CO bonds. On average, the angle C-O-N is 155" for the helical segments caused by an outward bending of the carbonyls from the helical axes. This is also reflected in the average values of 4 and 4, which are -64" and -4O", respectively, at an average of T(N--0-C) = 113". They deviate significantly from the torsion angles (--57", -47") given by Arnott & Dover (1967) for a-polyalanine. The sum of 4 and #, however, stays constant. In the 3,,-helical portions, mainly the $I angle changes to an average value of -20". This results in an even more pronounced outward bending of the carbon& with an angle C-O-N of 125". As can be seen from Figure 5, many main chain carbonpl groups form forked hydrogen bonds either to polar side-chain atoms or solvent molecules. Carbonyl groups that are not hydrogen-bonded to main chain NH groups are crowded in the non-helical regions. Due to their exposed positions, hydrogen bonds are often formed to solvent molecules. Those carbonyl groups which are not hydrogen-bonded in the current model, in the majority of cases have potential hydrogen bond partners. This has been found from the final difference Fourier map, which revealed a number of weakly occupied water molecules at proper locations. The tertiary structure of the protein is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between hydrophilic residues linked either directly or through water molecules. A total of 94 loealised water molecules were identified and refined. These comprise only the asymmetric unit of the unit cell. On isolation of one protein molecule out of the crystal lattice, the solvent molecules establishing the interface between symmetry related molecules must be counted too. When considering only a first hydration shell. i.e. counting only those symmetry related solvent molecules that make a direct, contact to protein atoms, 111 water molecules are covering the protein surface. By this means 40% of the free protein surface is occulted, as has been calculated from t.he difference between the accessible surface areas without and with solvent. For this purpose a modified version of Levitt's program has been applied, which basically uses the method of Lee & Richards (1971). With this program no internal water molecules (with zero accessible area) located in internal cavities are found. Numerous solvent molecules, however, are located in surface crevices or are hidden by other solvent molecules. At the interface areas between neighbouring protein molecules, pronounced clustering of solvent is observed. Figure 6 demonstrates an extensive hydrogen bond pattern between symmetry related molecules: 19 water molecules are inserted into the narrow channel along the a-fold screw axis passing through the origin of the unit cell. They establish both intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding. This view shows just a bit more than one-third of the z-axis, indicating the endless repetition of this chaining at angular settings differing by 120". The other interface areas between adjacent molecules are more isolated but are structurally similar. Out, of the five water molecules bound only to other waters, three are located

Portions A10 to Al6 and El3 to EF2 drawn in heavy lines belong to molecule 1. A clockwise rotation of 120' and & c/3-shift along --z gives the relation to portion El3 to F3 of molecule 2 and, correspondingly, a rotation of - 120" and a c/l-shift along +z locat,ej A10 to Al6 and fractions of EF6 to F3 of molecule 3 away from the observer. This indicates the presence of an endless repetition of the clustering shown here. Water molecules are represented by spot,s. Hydrogen bonds between t,hem and polar atoms are dotted. Most of the water molecules form more t'han 2 hydrogen bonds. in these contact areas and two in deep surface crevices. Most of the water molecules form two or three hydrogen bonds (average of 2.4). This ordered solvent structure comprises about 25% of the total water content in the crystal. Because of the good localisation, the R factor is improved by its inclusion over the entire range of resolution by more than 0.04. The still unsatisfactory R := 0.37 for the low-angle data >7 A is explained by the omission of the unordered solvent in the crystal. In the final difference Fourier map broad peaks are visible: which may account for an ill-ordered second shell of hydration.

(b) Surroundings

of the haem

The refinement of the structure revealed that the insertion of the haem into the apolar pocket' of the globin (Huber et al., 1969b,1971) differs from that in the myoglobin and haemoglobin structures (Takano, 1977a,b; Fermi, 1975; Ladner et al., 1977) by a 180" rotation about the a-y-meso axis. This new orientation was observed by the different placement of the vinyl groups in the two orientations (see above). Only vinyl 2 at pyrrole I is localised. It is tilted out of the haem plane by 40" towards the distal side to avoid close contacts with side-chain atoms of IleC4(34), ValFG5(92) and GlnG4(96). It is in van der Waals' contact with the carbonyl oxygen atom of GlnG4(96). Vinyl 4 at pyrrole II does not have a preferred location, since there is no steric hindrance by the neighbouring globin for all possible /? carbon positions. The electron density map does not indicate the preference of a conjugation of t'he vinyl

C=C double bond with the conjugated porphyrin system. This mobility of a vinyl group is not unique (Fermi, 1975). Recent proton magnetic resonance studies on CN-ligated erythrocruorin show two sets of hyperfine shifted methyl resonances (La Mar et al., 1978), which are ascribed to a disorder of the haem in the haem pocket. The ratio of the two components supposed to differ by a 180' rotation about the a-y-meso axis is 60:40. Further nuclear magnetic resonance studies by Ribbing et al. (1978) on CO-ligated erythrocruorin also support the presence of a haem disorder in solution. The crystallographic analysis unequivocally shows that the major component (if not the only one) does have the haem orientation, which is opposite to that in myoglobin and haemoglobin. The presence of a minor component should lead to a decrease of the electron density at the only located vinyl 2 at pyrrole I and an occurrence of electron densit,y at an alternate position. The flatness of the final difference Fourier map at the /3 carbon position of vinyl 2 proves the correctness of the full weight and the temperature factor of 16 AZ for this atom. To some extent a decrease in the weight can be compensated by a decrease in the temperature factor, but certainly not more than some 20%. No density was found at an alternate position for vinyl 4. Calculations of closest contact distances to the globin for all possible positions of its fi carbon did not reveal energetically favourable locations. These findings oppose the presence of a haem disorder in the crystal, but cannot definitely rule out the possibility of a minor component at a portion less than 25%. According to Ribbing et al. (1978) and La Mar et al. (1978), the two conformational isomers reveal different functional properties with respect to the Bohr effect. Certainly, crystallization may favour one species and explain the presence of only one isomer in the crystal. Figure 7 shows the environment of the haem in the refined met structure with vinyl 4 at one of its possible positions. The most obvious difference from the model proposed by Huber et al. (1971) is the presence of a histidine residue instead of glutamic acid at position E7(58). Although this side-chain may occupy the distal position, it is expelled from the haem pocket by the bulky side-chain of IleEll (62), being consistent with Huber's observation for glutamic acid. The imidazole ring makes a polar contact to the propionic acid group at pyrrole IV. Another contact

to the globin exists through the salt link between propionate III and ArgFG3(99). A water molecule is in hydrogen bond distance to N(i) of ArgElO(61) and to another solvent molecule which, in turn, is held by hydrogen bonds between the carboxylates of both haem propionates. Another indirect contact to the globin occurs in the hydrogen bond from propionic acid III to a water molecule linked to O(y) of SerF7(86). Calculation of the solvent accessibility for the haem atoms and the ligand site shows that the porphyrin is very tightly packed into the globin. Only the methyls and propionates at pyrroles III and IV have accessible surfaces. Even the water molecule at the ligand site (met form) has only 6% of its surface accessible for solvent molecules. The exchange of ligands is possible only because of the thermal mobility of the entire molecule which enables an entry to the distal site. Thus, the globin must respond differently on binding different, ligands to the haem iron. The interatomic contacts (less than 4 A) between the haem group (without the iron and the sixth ligand) and the 15 surrounding amino acids are given for the various ligation forms in Table 5 : 86 interatomic contacts are common to all of them. The total number of contacts is highest for carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin, indicating a considerably increased contact between the haem and the globin. The detailed differences between the various ligation forms may be recognized by comparing their individually refined sets of co-ordinates. Figure 9 shows the atomic details in the vicinity of the haem group on changing from deoxy to the other ligation forms. Besides, difference Fourier maps have been calculated using amplitudes F,(deri) FJdeoxy) (deri denotes aquomet, oarbonmonoxy, cyanomet) and calculated phases of the refined deoxy form. These will demonstrate the main differences of the various derivatives to the deoxygenated form (Fig. 8(a),(b) and (c)). The haem is viewed edge on, abstracted by a line. The surface of the molecule must be imagined at the top, the distal and proximal sides are on t'he left and right, respectively. (c) Aquomet versus deoxy form (Figs 8(a) and 9(a)) The most prominent positive peak is located at the position of the haem-bound water molecule in the aquomet form. Its peak height, however, does not correspond to a water molecule with full occupancy. This is caused by the presence of a partially occupied (half weight) water molecule also present in t'he reduced deoxy form and located practically at the same position as in the aquomet derivat'ive. Its presence artefact due to incomplete reduction of the aquomet form. cannot be an experimental A crystallographic proof for a fully reduced form may be seen in the fact that subsequent ligation with carbon monoxide did not reveal a partially occupied carbon monoxide. The large distance of 3.0 A (compare Table 6) between this water molecule and the iron atom suggests a five-co-ordination of the iron in both aquomet- and deoxy-erythrocruorin. On the other hand, the water molecule is not hydrogen-bonded

A ligand-linked water molecule is present which prevents the dioxygen from binding at an angle of 120".

either to polar globin atoms or other solvent molecules in the haem pocket. Only one van der Waals' contact with a distance of 2.8 A is formed to C(U) of the distal IleE11(62), suggesting a polar interaction of the water molecule with the iron ion. Partially occupied water molecules within the haem pocket have also been found in the deoxygenated forms of myoglobin and human haemoglobin (Takano, 19773; Fermi, 1975). In these cases, the waters were further from the iron but hydrogenbonded to the distal HisE7. On reduction from ferric to ferrous, the haem iron increases its distance from the pyrrole nitrogen plane by 0.07 A to 0.23 A, leading to a decrease of its distance to N(E) of HisF8(87) (see Table 6). The number of haem-globin contacts is practically unchanged. The r.m.s. difference between the co-ordinates of aquomet- and deoxyerythrocruorin is less than O-1 A. (d) Carbonmonoxy versus deoxy (Pigs 8(b) and Y(b))

The elongated peak at the distal side of the haem group represents the carbon monoxide molecule, which is inclined to the haem normal and bound off axis in agreement with the findings reported by Huber et al. (1970). A similar binding geometry has been found in carbonmonoxy-haemoglobin (Heidner et al., 1976) and

in carbonmonoxy-myoglobin (Norvell et al., 1975). In contrast to that, the energetically favourable linear binding along the haem normal is observed in carbonyl metalloporphyrins (Hoard, 1975; Peng & Ibers, 1976). The bent binding geometry may be explained by the steric interactions with the surrounding globin. In the case discussed here, linear bonding would cause impossibly close contacts with the distal group IleEll(62). Therefore, carbon monoxide must bind, if at all, in an angular fashion to the haem iron. The strain imposed on the carbonyl group is partially relieved by the rearrangement of the haem group and its environment. The haem group moves deeper into the pocket (Huber et al., 1970), approximately along the a-y-meso axis (see in Fig. 8(b) the gradient at the iron having a large component parallel to the haem plane). This lateral haem movement of 0.2 A is accompanied by a slight 2" rotation about an axis joining pyrroles III and IV. Further rotation is inhibited by PheF4(83) on the proximal side. In this new position the haem group makes a larger number (112) of contacts with the globin. The distal IleEll(62) is shifted away from the ligand by O-2 A, mediated through a concerted movement of the whole chain segment E6 to El2 of about 0.1 to 0.15 A. By this set of movements of the haem and the globin the strain of the carbonyl is considerably reduced. It is bound O-3 A off the haem axis with a bond angle Fe-C-O of 161"~5". The inclination of the Fe-C bond to the haem normal is 8", thus showing configuration, which seems preferable energetically (Collman, 1977). a more "tilted" The difference between these two angles was the angle observed by Huber et al. (1970) at 2.5 A resolution. Their value of 145"&15" compares well with the refined value or 153"&5". Off axis binding seems energetically unfavourable, since it distorts the octahedral co-ordination about the iron (Deatherage et uE., 1976). Nevertheless, the inclination of the Fe-C bond to the normal of the mean haem plane is here not followed by a corresponding distortion of the pyrrole nitrogen plane aligning its normal with the Fe-C bond. This asymmetric binding geometry of the carbonyl with respect to the pvrrole nitrogens brings the C-atom of carbon monoxide and the N-atom of pyrrole I into close contact (2.8 A), and is responsible for the considerably enlarged bond distance of 2.4 A to the iron (see Table 6). Collman et al. (1976) proposed that the distortion of the bond iron-carbon monoxide by the distal group leads to the considerably lower carbon monoxide affinity (Amiconi et al., 1972) than in free metalloporphyrins (Rougee $ Brault, 1975). Only by this means is molecular oxygen able to compete with ca'rbon monoxide, since it binds unstrained (Weber et al., 1978). On carbon monoxide binding the iron atom approaches the pyrrole nitrogen plane by 0.1 A and settles at a distance of 0.1 A, which is consistent with the kind of movement expected on change of its spin state (Collins et al., 1972a; Collman et al., 1974). The proximal HisF8(87) follows this movement, and even shortens the Fe-N(e) distance to 2.1 A (Table 6). This closer approach is enabled by a shift of the phenyl ring of PheF4(83) opposite to the 0.2 A movement of the imidazole directed towards the haem. (e) Cyanonzet versus deoxy (Figs 8(c) and 9(c)) A similarly distorted ligand bond geometry is also present in cyanomet-erythrocruorin. In iron-cyanide complexes cyanide is bound in a linear fashion to iron (Britton, 1967), whereas the distorted conformation has also been found in other

haemoglobins (Hendrickson & Love, 1971; Deatherage et al., 1976). The bend is again caused by the distal residue IleEll(62). Rearrangement of the haem group takes place with a 0.1 A shift deeper into the pocket, withdrawing the phenyl ring of PheCDl(38) in order to maintain optimal r-overlap with pyrrole IV. This movement relieves the strain imposed on the cyanide. The bond angle Fe-C-N is 164"*5" and the off axis position of the CN carbon atom may be described by the 5" inclination of the bond Fe-C to the haem normal. The bond distance to the iron in this slightly more linear configuration than in carbon monoxide is 2.2 A. However, the most striking and unexpected features in the difference Fourier map are the positive and negative peaks on both sides of the CN nitrogen, They are due to considerable conformational changes at the distal side. The side-chain of HisE7(58) has swung into the haem pocket by a 93" rotation about the C(u)-C(p) bond (see Figs 2 and 9(c)), making a polar contact with the cyanide. Such a conformation was previously thought to be impossible because of the steric conflicts with IleEll(62). This residue, however, has also changed its configuration by a x1 rotation of 109" to avoid a short contact of its C(G)-methyl with the histidine ring. This new conformation with the E7 imidazole inside the haem pocket and the rearranged IleEll is not the only one observed in this structure. The former configuration with HisE7 expelled from the haem pocket by IleEll is also adopted. These two alternatives occur at the same probability and could be described perfectly in the refinement by assigning half weights to them. An explanation for the rotation of the histidine to the distal position, which is a unique feature of the cyanomet form, may lie in the considerably different charge distribution of the cyanide. Deatherage et al. (1976) proposed that the substantial negative charge localized on the CN should influence the non-polar environment of the haem on the distal side. In fact, by the polar contact (d = 3.3 8) with the HisE7(58) imidazole the negative charge may be neutralized. But why do we find the histidine "outside" linked to the propionate IV? Deeper in the haem pocket an additional water molecule is located at a distance of 2 A from the cyanide, forming no other contacts with the globin. Its occupancy is only partial corresponding to the half weights of the HisE7 in both the inner and the outer positions. We propose that the histidine assumes either the "inner" conformation with the water absent or the "outer" conformation with the water attached to the cyanide instead. A ligandlinked water molecule is also present in oxy-erythrocruorin (Weber et al., 1978), where it is fully occupied. On cyanide binding the haem iron adopts a position O-1 A from the pyrrole nitrogen plane. The F8N(&)-Fe distance shrinks to 2.1 A. Similar to the situation in carbon monoxide binding the histidine movement towards the haem is enabled by a shift of PheF4(83) away from the haem.

geometry

The clear and highly resolved electron density of the haem is showu in Figure 3. In all ligand forms the haem group deviates considerably from planarity (see Figs 7 and 9). With the chosen set of parameters, which may account for both doming and ruffling (see above), the major distortion of the haem group turns out to be a kink along the u-y-axis. In this way a slightly concave surface is formed when looking from the proximal side, having the mean haem plane closer to the iron than the plane through the four coplanar pyrrole nitrogen atoms (Table 6). The methyl substituents deviate from this latter plane by 0.15 to 0.3 A, values which are reliably seen at 1.4 A resolution and justify the allowance for non-planarity of the haem group in the refinement. The angle between the best planes through pyrroles I and IV and pyrroles II and III is 7". No significant difference has been observed between the various forms. Table 6 summarizes the changes in the stereochemistry of the iron porphyrin on different ligation. The dependence of the distance iron-porphyrin plane on spin state changes of the iron is systematic and consistent with Hoard's theory (1971), at least in the direction. On ligation of the deoxygenated erythrocruorin with carbon monoxide and cyanide the iron spin changes from high to low, accompanied by a movement of the iron towards the haem plane. Surprisingly, all these shifts are rat#her small, though significant. In small iron porphyrins, however, the high spin iron is displaced out of the haem plane by 0.4 to 0.5 A (Hoard & Scheidt, 1973; Hoard et al., 1965) and a zero displacement is found for low-spin iron (Collins et al., 1972a; Collman et al., 1974). In deoxy-myoglobin the iron is 0.55 A out of the plane (Takano, 19776) and in human deoxy-haemoglobin it is O-6 A (Fermi, 1975). In the low-spin carbonmonoxy-myoglobin a distance of 0.1 A is found (Norvell et al., 1975) and also in carbonmonoxy-haemoglobin the iron moves towards the haem plane (Heidner et ccl., 1976). An obvious discrepancy exists in the iron displacements observed for met(0.07 A in rx-chain, myoglobin (0.4 8; Takano, 1977a) and horse met-haemoglobin O-2 A in /I-chain; Ladner et al., 1977). Ladner et al. (1977) point out that these differences might be related to the different spin equilibria observed in other metmyoglobin and met-haemoglobin derivatives. In erythrocruorin the largest shift in the iron position relative to the porphyrin plane occurs with 0.17 A between the high spin deoxy and low spin carbonmonoxy forms. There is no experimental evidence for mixed spin states. From consideration of the remarkable influence of the globin on ligand binding we may conclude that, despite the influence of the spin state changes, the detailed iron-porphyrin geometry is determined by the interaction of the haem group with its direct environment. The haem group appears to have a higher flexibility than was previously thought (Hoard, 1975; Perutz, 1976). It may tolerate changes of the ionic radius of the iron without large conformational changes. This might be accomplished by an expansion of the porphyrin ring as seen in a tin-porphyrin compound (Collins et al, 1972b). I'nfortunately, these effects probably are too small to be reliably analysed, even at 1.4 A resolution. The decrease of the bond distance Fe--N( E)(HisF8) on ligation of deoxy-erythrocruorin with CO or CN agrees with the corresponding distances of 2.16 A in fiveco-ordinated high-spin 2-MeImFe(II)TPP (Hoard & Scheidt, 1973) and 2.07 A in the six-co-ordinated low spin picket-fence oxygen adduct (Collman et al., 1974). The

generally larger values in erythrocruorin might be related to the tilt angle (only 7") of the HisF8 imidazole ring from a plane through F&-N(E) and the nitrogens of pyrroles I and III. Following the argument put forwatd by Collins et al. (1972a), in a staggered configuration minimum steric interaction takes place between the allowing less separation of the imidazole hydrogens and the pyrrole nitrogens, imidazole ring from the porphyrin core. This tilt angle is of relevance for the different oxygen affinities in different haemoglobin species (M. Perutz, personal communication). In each of the differently ligated forms the imidazole ring is perpendicular to the haem plane and the Fe-N(e) bond coincides with the haem normal within the limits of errors. No distortion of this bond occurs between liganded and unliganded erythrocruorin, as was observed in the myoglobin structure (Takano, 19778). (g) Tertiary structural changes

The overall r.m.s. atomic shift between deoxy- and ligated erythrocruorin varies for the globin part from 0.07 A for aquomet-, over 0.10 A for carbonmonoxy-, to 0.12 A for cyanomet-erythrocruorin. These numbers are corroborated by the finding from the difference Fourier maps that the largest alterations occur on cyanide binding. The trend is still maintained in the r.m.s. differences between the u carbon positions (0.05 A, 0.07 A, 0.09 A), which h ave been shown to represent upper limits of co-ordinate errors. The major structural changes appear to be concentrated in the environment of the haem group. The rearrangements of a.mino acid side-chains making haem contacts are transmitting the changes to the molecular surface by their non-covalent interactions with side-chain and main chain atoms of neighbouring residues. The flexibility of the molecule that allows variations in the main chain dihedral angles without considerable distortion also inhibits the rigid body movements of complete helices. Rather, the perturbations are local (between O-1 and 0.2 A) and fade out after some residues. In unaffected areas the differences are less than 0.05 A. In the following some particular and significant changes are described that are common for both carbonmonoxyand cyanomet-erythrocruorin. Whenever distances are given explicitly, the first number applies to the carbonmonoxy form and the second (in parenthesis) to the cyanomet derivative. As already pointed out, the most prominent changes occur at the ligand binding site. The distal side-chain moves by 0.15 (O-2) A causing a concerted movement greater than 0.1 A throughout the portion El to E13. The influence of this rearrangement diminishes towards the Cterminal end of helix E. The non-covalent interaction of this segment with the first residues of helix B (ABl to B8) is responsible for considerable disturbances in this region (Fig. 4). In particular, the side-chain of the invariant LeuBlO(24) is shifted 0*15(0.25) A by changes of 5" to 10" in the main chain angles of residues B8, B9 and BlO. The O.l(O.2) A movement of PheCDl(38) following the shift of the haem group only is made possible by the accompanying rearrangement at the CD corner (Fig. 4). The contacts of the haem with the residues GlnG4(96), LeuG5(97) and PheG8(100) (Fig. 7) are directly affected by the O-2(0*1) A shift of the haem deeper into the haem pocket. In the first eight residues of helix 0, displacements of O.l(O.15) A are found. This segment is involved in the u& subunit contact of tetrameric haemoglobin, which changes enormously on alteration of its quarternary structure (Perutz, 1976). The distant contact of the haem with PheH14(128) and PheH15(129) may cause a slight rearrangement of the amino-terminal LeuNA3( 1).

The structural adjustments at the proximal side of the haem ranging from F4 to F9 are largest with 0*2(0*15) L%at PheF4(83) and HisF8(87) and affect the C-terminal portion H19 to H22 (Fig. 4). In particular, the C(E) at,om of MetH22(136), which is in hydrophobic contact with PheF4(83), is rotated by 20" about the S(6)-C( &) bond. This does not affect the carboxyl end and its hydrogen bond to HisG2(95), which is believed to be the donor of the Bohr proton (Sick et al., 1972). Recent chemical modifications with the selective cleavage of MetH22(136) did not exhibit a reduced Bohr effect (Steffens et d., 1977) ruling out the hydrogen bond from N(s) of HisG2 to COOH of MetH22 as a possible source for the pH-dependence of the ligand affinity. Instead, we would like to draw attention to the interaction of the imidazole of HisE7(58) with propionate IV. Between deoxy- and cyanomet-erythrocruorin a decrease of the hydrogen bond from 2.9 H to 2.4 A is found for the outer position.

5. Conclusions
The comparison of the refined structures of unliganded deoxy-erythrocruorin with liganded carbonmonoxyand cyanomet-erythrocruorin shows significant changes in their tertiary structures propagating from the location of primary events. On binding the ligands carbon monoxide or cyanide the changes in the stereochemistry of the haem are obscured by the structural rearrangements in the vicinity of the haem group. The direct steric interaction of the ligand with the globin causes a shift of the haem deeper into the haem pocket and conformations1 changes of the surrounding residues. Despite these relaxations of the protein, the binding geometry is non-linear. The strain imposed by this energetically unfavourable situation is responsible for the reduced affinity for these ligands compared to free metalloporphyrins. In oxy-erythrocruorin, where the oxygen binds unstrained in an angular fashion (Weber et al., 1978), no pronounced conformational change takes place. This provides plausible molecular reasoning for the competitive position of dioxygen with other diatomic ligands. The haem geometry does not show systematic dependence on the valency state of the iron, suggesting that it is not very important for the iron-porphyrin stereochemistry. The changes in haem geometry on spin state changes, especially the iron to haem plane distance, are mainly in agreement with the "Hoard-Perutz" model. However, the explicit differences of this distance are much smaller than expected. We propose that the exact geometry is determined primarily by the non-covalent interactions of the protein with the ligand and the haem. In oxy-erythrocruorinan unexpected, though slight, shift of the iron to the proximal side was found (Weber et al., 1978). The ligand binding here may be considerably different, as is indicated by the iron-ligand distance of 1.8 8, which is significantly shorter than in carbonmonoxyand cyanomet-erythrocruorin. The porphyrin must have a higher flexibility than previously thought to accommodate the different ionic radii of the iron in different spin states. Comparison with myoglobin and haemoglobin structures complexes the shows that even at quite different geomet.ries of the iron-porphyrin effect of the particular neighbouring globin may yield comparable ligand affinities.
