Abstract The Sco family of proteins are involved in the assembly of the dinuclear CuA site in cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal enzyme in aerobic respiration. These proteins, which are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, are characterized by a conserved CXXXC sequence motif that binds copper ions and that has also been proposed to perform a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase function. The crystal structures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae apo Sco1 (apo-ySco1) and Sco1 in the presence of copper ions (Cu≠ySco1) were determined ∞ to 1.8- and 2.3-A resolutions, respectively. Yeast Sco1 exhibits a thioredoxin-like fold, similar to that observed for human Sco1 and a homolog from Bacillus subtilis. The Cu≠ySco1 structure, obtained by soaking apoySco1 crystals in copper ions, reveals an unexpected copper-binding site involving Cys181 and Cys216, cysteine residues present in ySco1 but not in other homologs. The conserved CXXXC cysteines, Cys148 and Cys152, can undergo redox chemistry in the crystal. An essential histidine residue, His239, is located on a highly flexible loop, denoted the Sco loop, and can adopt positions proximal to both pairs of cysteines. Interactions between ySco1 and its partner proteins yeast Cox17 and yeast COX2 are likely to occur via complementary electrostatic surfaces. This high-resolution model of a eukaryotic Sco protein provides new insight into Sco copper binding and function. Keywords Cytochrome c oxidase ∆ Sco1 ∆ Cox17 ∆ Copper chaperone ∆ Crystal structure

Introduction
Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme in the aerobic respiratory chain of eukaryotes and some bacteria. Yeast COX comprises three core catalytic subunits, COX1, COX2, and COX3, which are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, and nine additional nuclearencoded subunits [1]. COX also requires multiple cofactors, including two heme molecules, three copper ions, and magnesium, sodium, and zinc ions [2]. During the catalytic cycle, electrons transferred from cytochrome c to the dinuclear, mixed-valence CuA center in COX2 are used to reduce dioxygen to two molecules of water at a heterometallic heme A-CuB site in COX1 [3]. More than 30 nuclear-encoded accessory proteins have been implicated in the assembly of functional COX [4]. Two of these proteins, Cox17 [5, 6] and Sco1 [7, 8], are important for assembly of the CuA site and have been proposed to function specifically in copper transfer and loading. Yeast Cox17 is a 69-residue soluble protein that was originally proposed to act as a mitochondrial copper shuttle on the basis of its copper-binding properties [9] and dual localization to both the cytosol and the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) [10].

Cox17 to the mitochondrial inner membrane (IM) does not affect its function, suggesting that it does not transfer copper ions between the cytosol and the IMS [11]. Cox17 is currently believed to obtain copper from small, non-protein complexes within the mitochondrial matrix [12]. COX activity in Cox17-deficient yeast cells can be restored partially by both the addition of exogenous copper [5] and the overexpression of Sco1 [7], which receives copper directly from Cox17 [13]. Sco1 is anchored to the IM by an N-terminal transmembrane helix and contains an approximately 200 residue domain that extends into the IMS [14]. A conserved CXXXC motif in this soluble IMS domain is essential for function [15, 16]. Sco1 is conserved in other eukaryotes as well as in bacteria [17], whereas prokaryotic homologs of Cox17 have not been identified [18]. Soluble truncates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sco1 (ySco1), human Sco1 (hSco1), and the related human Sco2 (hSco2), all lacking a mitochondrial targeting sequence and a membrane anchoring helix, bind one copper ion [19≠21], which can be present as Cu(I) or Cu(II) [21]. X-ray absorption spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies indicate that the Cu(I) ion in ySco1 is trigonally coordinated by the two CXXXC cysteines, Cys148 and Cys152, and by a conserved histidine, His239 [19]. Although full-length ySco1 has been shown to interact with COX2 by coimmunoprecipitation and affinity chromatography [22], direct copper transfer to COX2 has not been established. Sequence alignments and secondary structure predictions suggest that the Sco proteins adopt a thioredoxinlike/peroxiredoxin-like fold [17]. This prediction was confirmed recently by the solution structure of Bacillus subtilis Sco (BsSco) [23] and crystal structures of BsSco ∞ ∞ and hSco1 to 1.7-A resolution [24] and 2.8-A resolution [25], respectively. The structural similarity of the Sco proteins to the thioredoxin family has led to the proposal that Sco functions as a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase, instead of, or in addition to, a copper trafficking protein [17, 24]. In this capacity, Sco would reduce the cysteines in the CuA center for copper binding. On the basis of extreme sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, the Sco proteins have also been proposed to function as copper-dependent redox switches in signaling [25]. In this model, bound Cu(I) is oxidized to Cu(II) and released, allowing the cysteine residues to participate in peroxidase chemistry and/or leading to conformational changes that might affect interactions with COX or other binding partners. To further probe the function of the Sco proteins, we have determined the crystal structures of apo ySco1 (apo∞ ySco1) to 1.8-A resolution and of ySco1 in the presence of ∞ copper ions (Cu≠ySco1) to 2.3-A resolution.

DNA by PCR. The forward primer for ySco1 (5¢-GGA ATTCCATATGCGCAGATTGGAAACACAGAAGG AGGCTG-3¢) was designed to include a 5¢ NdeI restriction enzyme site, and the reverse primer (5¢-CGGGATCCT TATTTGAATAAGAAGGAGTACCATGCCTCCTT CTGCTTG-3¢) was designed to include a 3¢ BamHI site. The PCR products were digested with NdeI/BamHI and inserted into the pET3a vector (Novagen). The resultant plasmid was then transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells. The E. coli cells were grown in Luria≠Bertani (LB) medium at 37 ∞C, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thiob-D-galactopyranoside at an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5, and the cells were harvested after 3 h. Protein purification Cells were lysed by freeze≠thawing the pellet three times in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 10 ml of 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris)≠HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM tris(2-carboxylethyl)phosphine (TCEP) per liter of harvested cells were added to the lysed cell pellet. DNaseI (approximately 5 lg/ml) was then added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20≠30 min. The lysate was ultracentrifuged at 125,000g for 2 h at 4 ∞C and dialyzed overnight at 4∞ C against 20 mM Tris≠HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mM TCEP (buffer A) to remove endogenous salts. The cell extract was then applied to a column packed with (diethylamino)ethyl Sepharose fast-flow resin (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with buffer A. ySco1 was eluted with an 18-column-volume 0≠ 0.2 M NaCl gradient, and was eluted at 100 mM NaCl. The protein was further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column preequilibrated with 50 mM Tris≠HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM TCEP. The purified ySco1 was then dialyzed into 50 mM Tris≠HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.2 mM TCEP and concentrated for storage at ≠80 ∞C. The identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Protein Sciences Facility, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The purified ySco1 contained 0.1≠0.15 equiv of copper per monomer. Crystallization and data collection ySco1 was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method. Crystal growth was optimal at 18 ∞C using 4.7 mg/ml protein mixed 1:1 with a well solution comprising 1.25 M Li2SO4 and 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.3. Rectangular-shaped crystals with average dimensions of 0.1 mm∑0.4 mm∑0.5 mm appeared within 3≠ 5 days. The crystals were transferred into a cryosolution composed of saturated Li2SO4 and well solution mixed in a 2:1 v/v ratio prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. All crystals belonged to the space group P21 and contained

four ySco1 molecules per asymmetric unit. Copper(I) soaks were conducted for 30 min aerobically in the cryosolution supplemented with 1 mM CuCl, 1 mM freshly prepared ascorbic acid, and 1 mM freshly prepared TCEP. Platinum derivative soaks were conducted aerobically for 3≠4 h in cryosolution supplemented with 5 mM K2Pt(CN)4. All data sets were collected at ≠160 ∞C using synchrotron radiation at DND-CAT beamline 5ID at the Advanced Photon Source. MOSFLM [26], XDS [27], and the CCP4 suite [28] were used for data processing. Structure determination and analysis The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser [29] using data collected on an apo-ySco1 crystal soaked in K2Pt(CN)4 (Table 1, apo-ySco1). This data set was not useful for multiple isomorphous replacement phasing, but was used because of its excellent resolution. The coordinates for hSco1 [25] (PDB accession code 1WP0) with all nonidentical side chains mutated to alanines were used as a search model. The asymmetric unit was found to contain four molecules related by a twofold noncrystallographic symmetry axis. The model was then further refined with CNS [30], and an initial ∞ electron density map was calculated to 1.8-A resolution. The partially refined apo-ySco1 coordinates were used as the search model for the copper-soaked ySco1 data set (Table 1, Cu≠ySco1). After iterative cycles of simulated
Table 1 Crystallographic statistics

annealing, minimization, and B-value refinement with CNS, followed by model rebuilding with XtalView [31], 632 of 800 residues per asymmetric unit were modeled for apo-ySco1 and 672 of 800 residues were modeled for Cu≠ySco1. No electron density was visible for the residues that were not modeled. Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed, rendering molecules A and C equivalent and molecules B and D equivalent. Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Ramachandran plots generated with PROCHECK [32] indicate that all models exhibit good geometry, with 99.7% of the apo-ySco1 residues and 98.2% of the Cu≠ySco1 residues in the most favored and additionally allowed regions. Figures were generated with PyMOL [33]. Rootmean-square deviations (rmsds) for superpositions were calculated by using the brute_force function of LSQMAN [34], with fragment length and fragment step size settings of 10 and 2, respectively, on structures aligned with PyMOL. A model for S. cerevisiae COX2 was generated by threading the yeast sequence onto the structure of bovine COX2 (PDB accession code 1V54) using Swiss-PdbViewer [35]. All residues within the threaded structure were selected for processing with the Swiss-PdbViewer function ``fix selected side chains: quick and dirty.'' The atomic coordinates (codes 2B7K for apo-ySco1 and 2B7J for Cu-ySco1) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, USA (http://www.rcsb.org/).

Results and discussion
Overall structure ySco1 exhibits a thioredoxin-like fold [36] with a central four-stranded b sheet (b3, b4, b6, b7) flanked by three a helices (a2, a4, a5) (Fig. 1a). Similar to hSco1 and BsSco, additional secondary structural features further classify ySco1 as a member of the peroxoiredoxin subfamily [37]. These features include a two-stranded b sheet (b1, b2) and a 310 helix at the N-terminus and an a helix (a5), and a b strand (b5) at the C-terminus. Strand b5 forms a parallel b sheet with b4. An extended loop, referred to as the Sco loop [25], spans residues 219≠241 and connects a4 and a6. A query of the Dali-Server [38] yielded hSco1 and ResA, a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase [39], as the closest structural relatives of ySco1. The rmsds for Ca atoms of ySco1 superimposed upon hSco1, BsSco, and ∞ ∞ ResA are 1.089 A (for 149 Ca coordinates), 1.984 A (for ∞ (for 105 Ca coordi130 Ca coordinates), and 2.020 A nates), respectively. Notably, the active-site cysteines of ResA occupy the same position as the ySco1 conserved CXXXC motif. The asymmetric unit for both the apo-ySco1 and Cu≠ ySco1 structures contains four molecules. Since ySco1, hSco1, and hSco2 are monomeric in solution by analytical gel filtration chromatography [19, 25] and BsSco is monomeric in solution by NMR [23], the observed tetramer is likely a result of crystallization and is not physiologically relevant. In this arrangement, molecules A and C are structurally equivalent, as are molecules B and D (Fig. 1b). The rmsd for Ca atoms for the superposition of apo-ySco1 molecule A and apo-ySco1 mol∞ ecule B is 0.545 A (for 145 Ca coordinates). The Sco loop is disordered in molecules A and C, with residues 222≠235 not modeled. These unobserved residues would extend into the solvent channels in the crystal lattice, and their apparent conformational flexibility is supported by the observation that the analogous loop is

disordered in both the BsSco solution [23] and crystal structures [24]. By contrast, the Sco loop is well defined in hSco1 [25] and in molecules B and D of ySco1 (Fig. 1b). The ySco1 Sco loop resembles that of hSco1 in length and orientation, but is missing the two antiparallel b strands found in hSco1. These two ordered Sco loops, located at the interfaces between molecules A and D and between molecules B and C, are locked into position by extensive intermonomer contacts. Specifically, the main chain oxygen of tyrosine D222 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain nitrogen of asparagine A259, and the side chain of aspartic acid D238 interacts with arginine A258 and asparagine A259. In addition, numerous hydrophobic contacts occur between residues D222≠D242 and residues from molecule A. The equivalent interactions are observed between molecules B and C. As a result of the Sco loop disorder in molecules A and C, residues 236≠240 at the base of the loop adopt a different conformation from the corresponding residues in molecules B and D. Putative copper-binding residues Three conserved residues, Cys148 and Cys152 from the CXXXC motif and His239, have been implicated as Cu(I) ligands [19]. The two cysteines have also been proposed to be the active-site cysteines if Sco functions as a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase [17, 24]. In ySco1, Cys148 and Cys152 are located at the junction of b3 and a2 (Fig. 2). The electron density clearly indicates that all the cysteines are reduced in apo-ySco1 (Fig. 3a). In molecules B and D, the two sulfur atoms are separated ∞ by 3.1 A, a distance too long for a disulfide bond (Fig. 2a). In molecules A and C, the sulfur atom of Cys152 occupies two conformations, modeled at 60 and 40% occupancy (Figs. 2b, 3a). The distances between ∞ these two positions and the sulfur of Cys148 are 2.8 A ∞ (40% occupancy), respec(60% occupancy) and 5.1 A tively. Although no additional reducing agent was added

after the final purification steps and the crystallization was carried out aerobically, these cysteines apparently remain reduced. The CXXXC cysteines are also reduced in the structures of hSco1 [25] (Fig. 2e) and BsSco [24] (Fig. 2f). Residue His239 is located at the base of the Sco loop, and is visible in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit. In molecules B and D, the Ne of His239 is 4.7 and ∞ 3.8 A from the sulfur atoms of Cys148 and Cys152, respectively (Fig. 2a). These distances combined with ∞ the 3.1-A sulfur≠sulfur distance could be compatible with a Cu(I) ion being coordinated by all three residues ∞ with Cu≠S distances of 2.25 A and a Cu≠N distance of ∞ 2 A, as suggested by extended X-ray absorption fine structure data [19]. These three residues adopt a similar arrangement in hSco1, although the distances between potential ligands are somewhat longer [25] (Fig. 2e). Owing to the disorder of the Sco loop in molecules A and C, His239 occupies a completely different position distant from the CXXXC motif (Fig. 2b). In these ∞ molecules, the Nd of His239 is 10.9 and 13.7 A from the sulfur atoms of Cys148 and Cys152, respectively. A similar arrangement is observed in the BsSco structure, ∞ with distances of 11≠16 A between the conserved histidine and cysteines [24] (Fig. 2f). This conformational flexibility may be important for positioning His239, a residue required for both ySco1 [22] and BsSco [16] function.

Structure of Cu≠ySco1 Despite strong evidence that the Sco proteins bind copper [19≠21, 23], a structure of a copper-loaded Sco protein has not been reported. Calculations in which a Cu(I) ion was linked to the conserved cysteines and histidine of BsSco produced a model consistent with NMR data, but the structure was not determined despite the fact that the protein could be isolated with approximately 0.7 equiv of bound Cu(I) [23]. Multiple cocrystallization and soaking attempts for BsSco were not successful, even under anaerobic conditions. No bound copper was detected, perhaps owing to the remote location of the conserved histidine [24]. Although the three proposed ligands are adjacent in the hSco1 structure, crystals obtained from a copper-supplemented preparation did not contain copper [25]. This finding was attributed to peroxides in the crystallization solution which may have oxidized bound Cu(I) to Cu(II), which was then released [25]. The orange color of copper-loaded hSco1 prior to crystallization suggests the initial presence of Cu(II), however, and recent work indicates that Cu(II) is stably bound to both ySco1 and hSco1 [21]. We attempted to obtain a structure of copper-loaded ySco1 by several methods. Purification of Cu≠ySco1 from cells grown in copper-supplemented medium was unsuccessful as were multiple cocrystallization trials and

crystallization screens of Sco1 reconstituted with Cu(I). Soaking apo-ySco1 crystals in a solution of CuCl, ascorbic acid, and TCEP resulted in significant electron density in anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated by using data collected at the copper absorption edge (Fig. 3b). These peaks, which were only present for molecules A and C, were best modeled by three copper ions with partial occupancies of 0.50, 0.32, and 0.30. These occupancies likely reflect one copper bound per molecule, but in slightly different positions, rather than a multicopper cluster. Surprisingly, the copper ions are within coordinating distance of two nonconserved cysteines, Cys181 and Cys216 (Fig. 2d), that are present in ySco1, but not in hSco1 or BsSco. According to a structure-based alignment, the corresponding residues are Ile203 and Ala238 in hSco1 and Val77 and Ile112 in BsSco (Fig. 2e, f). In addition, His239, which is far from the conserved cysteines in molecules A and C of apoySco1 (Fig. 2b), is within coordinating distance, although its electron density is poor. Soaking apo-ySco1 crystals in the CuCl solution also results in formation of a disulfide bond between Cys148 and Cys152 in all four molecules in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3c). Notably,

oxidation of the conserved cysteines is also observed in one of two molecules in the BsSco asymmetric unit after soaking or cocrystallizing with copper [24]. It is unclear why copper is observed in this unexpected location. A possible explanation is that the soaking solution contained Cu(II) rather than Cu(I). Although the soaking solution was prepared with CuCl and ascorbic acid anaerobically, oxidation of Cu(I) during the aerobic soak might not have been sufficiently countered by the ascorbic acid at the high ionic strength of the soaking solution. The Cu(II) could then have catalyzed oxidation of the conserved cysteines [40, 41]. In support of this scenario, Cys148 and Cys152 form a disulfide in Cu≠ySco1 but not in apo-ySco1. A similar phenomenon of cysteine oxidation was observed for copper-treated BsSco [24]. Reaction of Cu(II) with the two cysteines would yield Cu(I), which could either remain as Cu(I) or be reoxidized to Cu(II). Since Cys148 and Cys152 have been oxidized and cannot bind copper, the copper could diffuse away and then bind at the site formed by Cys181, Cys216, and His239. Since the observed copper-binding site is surface-exposed, composed of nonconserved residues, and partially occupied, it may be adventitious. We cannot exclude the possibility that this site plays a role in ySco1 function, however. Although recent data indicate that ySco1 binds Cu(II) [21], different residues could be involved in coordinating Cu(I) versus Cu(II). Mutagenesis data suggest that Asp238 is an additional ligand to Cu(II) [21]. This residue is located on the flexible Sco loop far from both the conserved and the nonconserved cysteines. Conformational rearrangements could bring Asp238 into position to bind Cu(II) at either site, however. Interestingly, mutating Asp238 to alanine affects Cu(I) and Cu(II) binding for hSco1, but only affects Cu(II) binding for ySco1. This finding is consistent with a role for Asp238 in binding Cu(II) at a site unique to ySco1, such as that observed in the Cu≠ySco1 structure. Protein≠protein interactions Complementary electrostatic surfaces have been proposed to be important for the interaction between BsSco and B. subtilis COX2 [23]. Charged residues have been demonstrated to play a role in interactions between copper metallochaperones and transport ATPases [42] as well as between thioredoxins and target proteins [43]. Electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated using PDB2PQR [44] and APBS [45] for ySco1, yeast Cox17 [46], and the S. cerevisiae COX2 sequence threaded onto the structure of bovine COX2 (Fig. 4). A negatively charged patch is present near the ySco1 CXXXC cysteines, whereas the copper-binding cysteines in both yeast Cox17 and the yeast COX2 model are surrounded by basic residues. These positively charged patches may dock with the acidic surface on ySco1 for copper transfer from S. cerevisiae Cox17 (yCox17) and subsequent insertion into the COX2 CuA site. The

The black arrow indicates the location of the transmembrane helices of COX2

negatively charged residues near the ySco1 CXXXC motif include Asp150, Asp154, Asp157, Asp197, Glu193, Asp234, and Asp238, of which all are conserved in hSco1 except for Glu 193. Replacement of Asp238 with alanine yields nonfunctional ySco1 and hSco1, consistent with a role in target recognition as well as the suggested role in Cu(II) binding by ySco1 [21]. With structures of both yCox17 [46, 47] and ySco1 now available, directed protein≠protein interaction studies can be pursued. Functional implications The Sco proteins have been proposed to function as thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases, redox signaling proteins, copper trafficking proteins, or some combination thereof. The overall structural similarity to thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases is well documented [23≠25] and is clear in the ySco1 structures. If Sco were a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase, it may be needed to reduce the COX2 CuA cysteines prior to copper insertion. The presence of disulfide bonds in Cu≠ySco1 and BsSco [24] indicates that the conserved CXXXC cysteines can undergo redox chemistry. Bacterial genomic analysis reveals a relationship between Sco and cytochrome c, further suggesting that cytochrome c could be responsible for keeping the Sco CXXXC motif reduced [18]. On the basis of these findings, the assignment of Sco function as a reductase seems reasonable, but there are several discrepancies. First, thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase activity could not be detected for hSco1 [25] or hSco2 [48] and

has not been reported for any Sco protein. Second, the disulfides observed in the BsSco and Cu≠ySco1 structures could result from undue exposure of the purified proteins to air or Cu(II). Finally, the CXXXC cysteines have been shown to participate in copper binding [19] and ySco1 has been demonstrated to receive copper from yeast Cox17 [13]. Although it is possible that the conserved cysteines both deliver copper and reduce the COX2 cysteines, as suggested previously [24], the current evidence for a thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase function is not convincing. In the redox signaling model, oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) and subsequent copper release leads to peroxidase activity and/or conformational changes affecting interactions of Sco proteins with various partners [25]. The ability of both ySco1 and hSco1 to stably bind Cu(II) [21] and the lack of peroxidase activity [25] are not consistent with this model, however. Finally, Sco1 might function solely in copper trafficking. Recognition of partner proteins could occur by complementary electrostatic surfaces (Fig. 4), and the acquisition of copper from Cox17 or its release to COX2 would be facilitated by movement of the Sco loop. The copper ligand His239 lies on the flexible Sco loop and occupies very different positions in the molecule depending on the conformation of this loop. The oxidation state of copper during transfer is unknown, but since Cox17 binds Cu(I) [46, 47] and the Sco proteins bind predominantly Cu(I) [19, 21], all steps might involve Cu(I). The Cu(II) present in ySco1 and hSco1 might occupy weaker-affinity sites, such as the one observed in the Cu≠ySco1 structure (Fig. 2d). The secondary site could act as a repository for copper under

copper-replete conditions and then donate its copper to the CXXXC site when loading of COX2 becomes necessary. In the ySco1 structures, the location of His239 on the flexible Sco loop and its proximity to either pair of cysteines suggests a possible transfer mechanism between copper-binding sites of varying affinities.
