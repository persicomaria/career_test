We have examined the interaction between NusA and the nascent RNA in Escherichia coli transcription complexes on four different templates. Photocrosslinking CTP and UTP analogs were incorporated internally and at the 3'end of the RNA. Identical templates with and without boxA sequences were compared. We found that NusA did not contact the ten nucleotides nearest to the 3' end of the RNA in complexes containing RNA up to 20 nucleotides long. Longer RNA did crosslink to NusA with all four templates examined, however. We reported that RNA 80 nucleotides long from the bacteriophage T7 A1 promoter substituted in two RNA stem-loops with photocrosslinking UMP analogs did not crosslink to NusA, even though interaction between NusA and the transcription complex were demonstrated. Here, we report that when this same RNA is substituted at CMP residues, it does crosslink to NusA. Templates containing the E. coli ribosomal RNA promoter rrnG P2, with and without a boxA sequence downstream, were compared. Long RNAs from both crosslinked to NusA, and thus boxA RNA sequences are not required for interaction with NusA. NusA did not interact with the free RNA containing boxA once released from the transcription complex, nor did it interact with RNA in a binary complex containing only RNA polymerase and RNA, without the DNA template.

Introduction
The Escherichia coli transcription apparatus consists of a core enzyme, containing four peptides in stoichiometric amounts, with subunit composition ~2~'. One copy of a small peptide, omega (f2) also interacts with the core. Initiation of transcription is regulated by the interaction of one of numerous sigma factors (~) with the core enzyme, to produce a specific class of holoenzyme. Holoenzyme RNA polymerase locates and specifically binds to a promoter on the DNA. It undergoes a number of structural transitions before entering the elongation mode (Krummel & Chamberlin, 1989,1992). One of these is the transition from an initiation complex to an elongation complex, which is accompanied by the release of c and the binding of the NusA protein (Gill et al., 1991a,b; Greenblatt & Li, 1981. NusA is an E. coli protein that modulates transcription by enhancing pausing and termination at some sites (Greenblatt et al., 1980). It interacts directly with the termination factor Rho (Schmidt & Chamberlin, 1984b) and with the RNA polymerase core enzyme, and it alters the interaction between core subunits and the 3' end of the nascent RNA

(Zhang & Hanna, 1994). NusA has been shown to be required for bacteriophage lambda N-mediated transcriptional antitermination in vitro (Mason & Greenblatt, 1991; Mason et al., 1992b; Nodwell & Greenblatt, 1991; Schauer et al., 1987; Whalen et al., 1988) and to play roles in termination (Greenblatt et al., 1981; Kassavetis & Chamberlin, 1981; Nakamura et al., 1986; Schmidt & Chamberlin, 1987) and attenuation at some sites, and is therefore classified as a transcription elongation factor (for reviews, see Adhya & Gottesman, 1978; Das, 1993; Platt, 1986; Richardson, 1993; Roberts, 1988). Genetic evidence suggests a potential interaction between NusA and the boxA sequence (5' CGCTCTTA 3') found eight base-pairs promoterproximal to boxB in the K nut site downstream of the PR promoter (Friedman & Olson, 1983; Friedman et al., 1990). An A.T to T.A transversion at the 3' nucleotide of boxA abolishes N-mediated antitermination with the NusA from E. coli, but makes growth possible in the presence of the NusA protein from Salmonella typhimurium. Direct interaction between NusA and boxA-containing RNA has been suggested by filter-binding experiments with purified RNA and NusA (Tsugawa et al., 1985).

NusA Contacts RNA in E. coli Transcription Complexes

Recent work with purified proteins and RNA containing the boxA sequence found in the E. coli ribosomal RNA operons supports the idea of interaction between boxA RNA and the NusB and NusE proteins, rather than NusA, however (Mason et al., 1992a; Nodwell & Greenblatt, 1993). Analysis of active E. coli transcription complexes seems to suggest that NusA does not interact directly with boxA RNA. A DNA oligonucleotide complemeiiFary to boxA RNA does not inhibit the NusA-enhanced transcriptional pausing associated with the tR] terminator between the cro and clI genes of phage X. A DNA oligonucleotide complementary to a segment of nascent RNA just upstream of an RNA hairpin does inhibit NusA-enhanced pausing, however (Faus et al., 1988). NusA enhanced pausing can also occur in the absence of any RNA secondary structures, as is the case for the pause site located 16 nucleotides downstream of the K PR' promoter. Although this pause site is located immediately upstream from a boxA sequence, pausing occurs before the boxA RNA has been synthesized, and thus it is not available for interaction with NusA (Grayhack et al., 1985). If NusA functions to enhance transcriptional pausing through direct interaction with the nascent RNA, this interaction cannot require the presence of boxA or boxB sequences, because many templates upon which NusA acts do not contain them. This does not rule out the possibility that NusA may interact with boxA RNA, however. Two different modes for NusA function have been proposed (Schmidt & Chamberlin, 1984a; Sigmund & Morgan, 1988), and the NusA domains involved in termination and antitermination appear to be separable (Nakamura et al., 1986). In previous work, we have analyzed protein-RNA interactions in a transcription complex at a NusAenhanced pause site 80 nucleotides downstream from the bacteriophage T7 A1 promoter (Dissinger & Hanna, 1991). The azide-tagged nucleotide analog 5-[(4-azidophenacyl)thio]uridine 5'-triphosphate (5-APAS-UMP) was placed at a variety of positions throughout the RNA, including several positions in both the stem and loop of the hairpin immediately upstream from the pause, and at the 3' end of the RNA. The concentration of NusA was tested over a large range, up to a NusA to polymerase ratio of 250:1, at which the transcription complexes are greater than 99% saturated with NusA. NusA was shown to interact with the paused complexes containing analog-substituted RNA to enhance the pause and to alter the accessibility of the RNA to cleavage by ribonuclease T, by this interaction. Analog substitution in the RNA does not change the RNA secondary structure formed by the transcript, as evidenced by the normal formation of the RNA hairpin just upstream of the pause. Although NusA interacts with this transcription complex to enhance pausing, no interaction between the RNA and the NusA was observed. We have also placed a crosslinking analog at the 3' end of the RNA in the transcription complex at the NusA-enhanced pause site 16 nucleotides downstream from the K PR.

promoter. Although we showed that NusA interacts with this complex to change interactions between the 3' end of the RNA and the [3 and [3' subunits of the core enzyme, again no direct interaction between NusA and the RNA was observed (Zhang & Hanna, 1994). In neither of these studies did the RNA contain a boxA sequence. Although we did not observe RNA crosslinking to NusA in these experiments, the presence of an RNA-binding domain within NusA does suggest that it is an RNA binding protein (Gibson et al., 1993). We have now analyzed transcription complexes on four different DNA templates to probe for NusA-RNA interactions. Photocrosslinker-tagged RNAs were synthesized in vitro with E. coli R N A polymerase using the nucleotide analogs 5-APASUTP and 5-APAS-CTP (Hanna, 1989; Hanna et al., 1989, 1993). These RNAs contain crosslinkers throughout RNA stems and loops and in singlestranded regions of the transcripts. Templates containing the same promoters, but differing in the presence or absence of boxA sequences, were compared. Interactions between NusA and free RNA released from transcription complexes or RNA polymerase-RNA binary complexes were also examined.

Results
We used a photocrosslinking approach to look for interactions between the nascent RNA in E. coli transcription complexes and NusA. Two azidetagged pyrimidine analogs, 5-APAS-UTP and 5-APAS-CTP, which are incorporated at internal positions in RNA or at the 3' end of RNA by E. coli RNA polymerase (Dissinger & Hanna, 1991), were incorporated into the nascent RNA in several different transcription complexes. Transcription complexes containing analog-tagged RNA were isolated and then irradiated to covalently attach the RNA to proteins with which it makes direct contact (Hanna, 1989, 1993). By incorporating (~32p)-labeled nucleotides during transcription, the crosslinked proteins were then radioactively tagged during irradiation. In this way, specific protein-nucleic acid interactions in the transcription complex could be identified. Photocrosslinking nucleotide analogs were placed at various positions in both short and long RNAs from four different templates. Two templates contained the E. coli rRNA rrnG P2 promoter, with (template 1) and without (template 2) a boxA sequence c~ntered 30 base-pairs downstream from the transcription start site. Template 3 contained the T7 A1 promoter, and template 4 contained the X PR. promoter, with a boxA sequence centered 19 base-pairs downstream from the transcription start site.

Figure 1. Crosslinking of NusA to boxA-containing RNA in transcription complexes. Transcription complexes containing a variety of lengths of analog-tagged RNA were prepared from template 1 in the presence and absence of NusA. Template I contains the rrnG P2 promoter and has a boxA sequence centered 29 to 30 nucleotides downstream from the transcription start site. Transcription complexes were irradiated as described in the text, and the protein-RNA complexes were analyzed on a SDS/10% polyacrylamide gel (lanes I to 4). In a parallel experiment, the RNA was isolated and then added back to NusA storage buffer (lane 5) or to NusA (lane 6) in the absence of RNA polymerase or the DNA template. After irradiation and electrophoresis, the protein-RNA complexes were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then silver-stained and exposed to X-ray film at -80°C. The autoradiogram of the nitrocellulose membrane containing the RNA-protein complexes is shown. The positions of the RNA polymerase subunits and NusA are indicated on the left.

Figure 2. Comparison of NusA crosslinking to RNAs with and without boxA. Transcription complexes containing a variety of lengths of analog-tagged RNA, up to approximately 100 nucleotides long, were prepared from templates I and 2 in the presence of NusA. These templates are identical in sequence until position +25 relative to the +1 transcription start site from the P2 promoter. Thereafter, template 2 lacks the boxA sequence found in template 1. Samples were irradiated, and the protein-RNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography as describe in the text. The autoradiogram of the nitrocellulose membrane containing the RNA-protein complexes is shown. and no significant difference in the level of N u s A crosslinking was apparent. A small amount of a labeling was also observed because some short RNAs were present in these reactions (data not shown). Reaction parameters affecting NusA interactions with the RNA Ternary transcription complexes in which polymerase was stalled after incorporation of the first 20 nucleotides in the RNA from template 3 were formed with and without NusA (Figure 3B, lanes 1 and 6). To analyze the interactions of the 20-mer RNA, 5-APAS-CMP was incorporated at positions +12, +14, and +17 (Figure 3A). When ternary complexes containing the 20-mer RNA were irradiated, N u s A was not crosslinked to the RNA even w h e n it was present from the start of transcription (Figure 3C, lane 1). Longer RNA was therefore prepared by forming the 20-mer RNA in the presence or absence of NusA, and then elongating (chasing) the RNA in the presence of ATP, CTP, GTP and 5-APAS-UTP. N u s A was present in the chase reaction added to the 20-mer which was formed without N u s A present. The RNA species formed ranged from approximately 70 to 89 nucleotides long (Figure 3A, lanes 3 and 7). In the reaction in which N u s A was added

and in intact transcription complexes paused on the DNA template. RNA of various lengths was prepared by carrying out transcription from template 1 in the presence of an RNA chain terminator. The RNA produced ranged from approximately 50 to over a 100 nucleotides long (data not shown). When crosslinking was carried out utilizing intact transcription complexes, both the 13 and 13' subunits of the core polymerase and NusA were crosslinked to the nascent RNA (Figure 1, lane 4). However, w h e n the boxA-containing R N A was purified away from the transcription complex and was then added back to NusA, no crosslinking to NusA was observed (Figure 1, lane 6). Comparison of NusA crosslinking to RNA with and without boxA sequences Ternary transcription complexes were prepared from templates 1 and 2 to determine whether the boxA sequence present in template 1 was required for RNA crosslinking to NusA. Again, RNA of several lengths was present in each reaction. The 13 and 13' subunits of core and N u s A were crosslinked to the RNA from both templates (Figure 2, lanes 2 and 4),

during the chase, the major RNA species formed were 80 and 89 nucleotides long (Figure 3B, lane 7), and they correspond to positions in the transcript at which two sequential UMPs are encoded (Figure 3A). E. coli RNA polymerase cannot incorporate two 5-APAS-UMPs sequentially N u s A was crosslinked to the long RNA even w h e n N u s A was not present during formation of the 20-mer RNA (Figure 3C, lanes 3 and 5).

Effect of analog position in the RNA on NusA crosslinking
The 80-mer RNA was p r e p a r e d from template 3 by incorporating either 5-APAS-UMP (Figure 4A) or both 5-APAS-UMP and 5-APAS-CMP (Figure 4B) throughout the RNA. In the absence of UMP, polymerase stops after incorporation of 5-APASUMP at +80 because it cannot incorporate a second analog at +81 (Figure 3A). The residual 20-mer, which does not chase, does not contain any photocrosslinking nucleotide analog, and thus crosslinking of only the 80-mer RNA can be examined. When only 5-APAS-UMP was incorporated into the RNA, only the 13and 13' subunits of the core polymerase were crosslinked to the RNA, even w h e n NusA was present (Figure 4C, lanes 3 and 4). However, w h e n 5-APAS-CMP was also incorporated into the 80-mer RNA, NusA was crosslinked to the nascent RNA (Figure 4D, lane 4).

Interactions of RNA in binary complexes with polymerase in the absence of the DNA
Ternary transcription complexes were formed from template 4 in which the RNA polymerase was stalled immediately upstream from the D N A - b o u n d Gln111 protein. The RNA in these complexes contained 5-APAS-UMP throughout and was 49 nucleotides long. When these complexes were irradiated, the 13 and 13' subunits of core and NusA were all crosslinked to the RNA (Figure 5, lane 7). In a parallel experiment, the analog-tagged 49-mer RNA was separated from polymerase and D N A b y purification from a gel. It was then added back to NusA, polymerase, or N u s A and polymerase, u n d e r conditions which have recently been shown to allow RNA binding to polymerase in the appropriate conformation for cleavage of the 3' end b y GreA and GreB (Altman et al., 1994). The N u s A was added to the RNA in the absence of polymerase (Figure 5, lane 2), before polymerase was added (lane 3), at the same time that polymerase was added (lane 4), or after the polymerase-RNA complex had formed (lane 5). In all cases, only labeling of 13a n d / o r 13' was observed, with no detectable interaction b e t w e e n the RNA and NusA.

used this approach in previous work to analyze the interaction of the nascent RNA through the E. coli transcription complex, in the absence of NusA. We have previously attempted to crosslink N u s A to the nascent RNA in two different elongation complexes, but with no success. The first elongation complex was formed from the T7 A1 promoter (template 3), and the complex contained RNA 80 nucleotides long substituted at every UMP residue from +21 to +80 with 5-APAS-UMP (Dissinger & Hanna, 1991). Here, we showed that N u s A still interacts with the elongation complex to enhance pausing, that the analog does not prevent formation of the normal secondary structure of the 80-mer RNA (Figure 6A), and that N u s A alters the accessibility of the RNA to ribonuclease T1. However, we observed no crosslinking of N u s A to the 3' end of the RNA or to any of the positions in the stem-loop structures which contained 5-APAS-UME In a second stud}~ w e p r e p a r e d an elongation complex from the ~ PR' p r o m o t e r (template 4) which contained RNA 16 nucleotides long with 5-APAS-CMP substituted uniquely at the 3' end of the RNA (Zhang & Hanna, 1994).

Figure 5. RNA crosslinking to core RNA polymerase in the presence of NusA. RNA 49 nucleotides long containing the potocrosslinking nucleotide analog 5-APAS-UMP throughout was prepared from the X P,. promoter (template 4), and it was then purified from a gel. The sequence of this RNA is AACGAUGGGU UAAUUCGCUC GUUGUGGUAG UGAGAUGAAA AGAGGCGGC. The RNA was added back to NusA alone (lane 2), core RNA polymerase alone (lane 3), or a mixture of core and NusA (lane 1 and lanes 3 to 5). NusA was either premixed with the core prior to addition of the RNA (lane 3), added to the core at the same time that the RNA was added (lane 4), or added to the core-RNA complex after it had formed (lane 5). In a parallel experiment, transcription complexes were formed containh~g the same RNA in the presence of NusA. All reactions were irradiated and analyzed as described in the text.

the elongation complex, it alters the interactions b e t w e e n the 3' end of the R N A and the 13 and ~' subunits of the core polymerase. Still, no crosslinking of N u s A to the RNA was observed. From these studies, we have b e e n tempted to conclude that N u s A can function without direct interaction with the 3' end of the R N A or with R N A stem-loop structures. However, N u s A does contain an RNA binding d o m a i n (Gibson et al., 1993), and there has b e e n one report of direct interaction b e t w e e n RNA and N u s A (Tsugawa et al., 1985). We have therefore considered the possible reasons that w e have not observed direct interaction b e t w e e n the nascent R N A and N u s A in our previous studies. Firstl~ the RNA used in our previous work did not contain a boxA sequence, which is p r o p o s e d to be responsible for the N u s A interactions with free RNA. Secondl}~ in our earlier work, transcription complexes w e r e always p r e p a r e d in the absence of NusA, purified b y column chromatograph}; and then N u s A was a d d e d back prior to irradiation. Because N u s A can bind to the transcription complex only after the ~ subunit is released, and in vivo N u s A is present at the time of release, we considered the possibility that N u s A interaction with the R N A in the transcription complex might b e d e p e n d e n t u p o n interaction of N u s A with the complex at the time of ~ release. Although N u s A can still induce pausing w h e n a d d e d to purified ternary complexes, the suggestion

of two different modes for NusA interaction with the transcription complex has been raised by others. Such dual action has been suggested by the different nucleotide concentrations required for NusAenhanced pausing on different templates (Schmidt & Chamberlin, 1984a), and the different nucleotide optima for NusA enhancement of transcriptional pausing and termination on the same template (Sigmund & Morgan, 1988). Thirdl)4 in our earlier studies, crosslinker has been present at several positions in an RNA stem-loop structure, but no analog had been present in the single-stranded region upstream of the stem-loop. However, the results of our ribonuclease protection experiments on intact transcription complexes in the presence of NusA indicated that this region of the RNA is protected by NusA. The experiments reported here address these three possible reasons for lack of NusA-RNA interaction in our earlier work. NusA interacts with RNA in transcription complexes and boxA is not required Templates 1 and 2 were utilized to determine whether the presence of boxA sequences in the DNA, and therefore synthesis of boxA RNA, was required for direct interaction of the NusA with RNA. Templates 1 and 2 are essentially equivalent except for the presence or absence of boxA. We have also utilized template 1 to probe for direct interactions between boxA-containing RNA and NusA, in the absence of the RNA polymerase. While we did observe crosslinking of boxA-containing RNA to NusA in transcription complexes (Figure 1, lane 4), we observed no interaction between the same RNA and NusA after removal of the polymerase by extraction with phenol (Figure 1, lane 6). Extraction with phenol did not inactivate the azide group (data not shown). We also found that the boxA sequence was not required for interaction of NusA with the RNA (Figure 2, compare lane 2 with lane 4). These results conflict with earlier reports of direct interaction between NusA and free boxA R N A (Tsugawa et al., 1985). Our experiments do differ from this other work in that the N u s A / R N A ratio used in our work was much lower (2:1), and thus we cannot rule out the possibility that at very high concentrations of NusA, binding to boxA RNA may occur. The lack of a requirement for boxA in the active transcription complex does not rule out the possibility that NusA might have a stronger binding affinity for boxA RNA than other RNA sequences, but does prove that boxA was not required for NusA interaction with the RNA. NusA does not need to be present when ~ is released to interact with the RNA To determine whether NusA must be present when ry is released for the interaction of NusA with RNA, we have carried out crosslinking experiments on T7 A1 in which NusA was present from the start

of transcription and in which NusA was added to isolated complexes. The results are shown in Figure 3. When NusA was present from the start of transcription, the RNA formed ranged from approximately 70 to 89 nucleotides in length (Figure 3B, lanes 3 and 4), and NusA was cross]inked to the RNA (Figure 3C, lane 3). When transcription complexes containing RNAs 20 nucleotides long were formed without NusA, isolated by gel filtration, and then chased in the presence of NusA, two major RNA products were formed. In addition to the 80-mer, which was the major product in our earlier work, elongation to the next sequential UMPs in the transcript occurred, producing RNA 89 nucleotides long (Figure 3B, lanes 7 and 8). Again, crosslinking to NusA was observed (Figure 3C, lane 5). These data suggest that NusA need not be present at the start of transcription or when ry is released in order for the interaction with RNA to occur.

Relationship of NusA crosslinking to the position(s) of crosslinkers in the RNA On template 3, which contains the T7 A1 promoter, crosslinking of NusA to the RNA was unexpected. These results were surprising because work we had done previously with a complex containing RNA 80 nucleotides long had resulted in no crosslinking to NusA (Dissinger & Hanna, 1991). NusA enhances pausing 80 nucleotides downstream from the T7 A1 promoter, even when the RNA is modified at every UMP with 5-APAS-UME In addition, NusA interacts with the transcription complex to alter the accessibility of the RNA to ribonuclease T1. Thus, two separate experiments have shown that NusA does interact with the paused transcription complex, which we designated P1. Yet, upon irradiation, no cross]inking to NusA occurs. The secondary structure for this RNA was determined previously (Dissinger & Hanna, 1991) and is shown in Figure 6A. Although in our earlier work, we had not observed crosslinking to P1 RNA, our ribonuclease protection experiments showed protection of nucleotide G +41 by NusA. This nucleotide is just upstream of the second hairpin in this RNA, it falls in a region of single-stranded RNA, and is not in the vicinity of any of the 5-AEAS-UMP groups. At that time, we suggested that if NusA were contacting the nascent RNA, that contact might involve the single-stranded region at the base of the stem-loop. To address this, we have now repeated our earlier work with the 80-mer P1 RNA containing 5-APASUMP, and we have carried out the same experiment using our new analog, 5-APAS-CTP. In both cases, transcription complexes containing only the P1 RNA were formed (Figure 4A and B, lanes I and 3). As we observed in our earlier work, when only 5-APASUTP was used, there was no cross]inking to NusA (Figure 4C, lane 4). However, when 5-APAS-CTP was used, the P1 RNA did cross]ink to NusA (Figure 4D, lane 4). We have compared the positions of crosslinkers in these two RNAs (Figure 6A and B).

NusA Contacts RNA in E. coil Transcription Complexes

When 5-APAS-CTP is utilized, there are crosslinkers in the single-stranded region of the RNA 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15 and 17 nucleotides from the end of the RNA. The secondary structure could not be determined enzymaticall~ because the ribonuclease CL3, which was used for cleavage after CMP residues in the determination of the 80-mer structure, does not cleave when APAS-CMP is present (data not shown). NusA crosslinking was observed with only 5-APAS-UTP, however, when RNA longer than 80 nucteotides was formed (specifically the 89-mer; Figure 3B and C). The RNA secondary structure for the 89-mer is shown in Figure 6C. Crosslinking nucleotides are located in a single-stranded region at the 3' end of the RNA and at nucleotides 2, 5, 8, 9 and 12 from the end. These data, together with our earlier ribonuclease protection data, suggest that the NusA interaction with nascent RNA may involve singlestranded regions of the RNA which are further than ten nucleotides from the 3' end of the RNA. Comparison of the positions of the crosslinkers in the RNA of the T7 A1 80-mer RNA, which does not crosslink to NusA, and the 89-mer RNA, which does crosslink to NusA, most strongly supports this model. The positions of the crosslinkers in the stem-loop are identical in these two RNAs, but in the 89-mer, several crosslinkers are now present in the single-stranded region of the RNA 9 to 13 nucleotides from the 3' end. Lack of interaction with the nucleotide nine nucleotides from the end is supported by the failure of NusA to crosslink to the 20-mer RNA from T7 A1 containing 5-APAS-CMP (Figure 3). The 20-mer RNA which contained crosslinkers at positions four, seven and nine nucleotides from the 3' end of the RNA (Figure 3B, lane 1 and Figure 3C, lane 1) did not crosslink to NusA. This result is consistent with our previous work, and suggests that NusA does not interact either with the 3' end of the RNA or with nucleotides within the first ten bases upstream from the 3' end of the RNA. Because the identity of the specific nucleotide(s) responsible for NusA crosslinking in each of these complexes has not been determined, and because the exact secondary structure of each RNA is not known, it is not possible to make any definitive statements about the relative position of NusA and the 3' end of the RNA. In addition, because there is more than one possible conformation for the elongation complex, and these conformations may involve very different polymerase-RNA interactions near the 3' end of the RNA (Nudler et al., 1994), it is impossible to make statements about the relationship of analog distance from the 3' end of the RNA to NusA crosslinking just using these data. The structure of each elongation complex being studied would have to be determined before any further conclusions could be made.

template, and the RNA can bind to the polymerase in a configuration which allows both RNA cleavage and nucleotide addition at the 3' end of the RNA (Altman et al., 1994). To determine whether RNA added back to polymerase in the absence of the DNA template aligned itself appropriately for interaction with NusA, we purified RNA of two different lengths from two different templates. Results involving the 49-mer RNA from the X PR. promoter are shown in Figure 5. When the 49-mer RNA was made and crosslinking was carried out in an intact transcription complex, the ~ and ~' subunits of the core enzyme and NusA were all contacted by the RNA (Figure 5, lane 7). However, when the RNA was added to polymerase in the absence of the DNA template, only crosslinking to ~ a n d / o r ~' was observed. This result was independent of the time of addition of NusA. Addition of NusA before polymerase (Figure 5, lane 3), with polymerase (lane 4), or after the polymerase-RNA complex had formed (lane 5), all resulted in no crosslinking to NusA. Thus, although RNA can bind to RNA polymerase in the absence of the DNA template in such a way that the 3' end of the RNA binds to ~ and ~' at the appropriate site, the RNA binding domain involving NusA appears to be inaccessible under these conditions. The fact that only ~ and ~' were crosslinked to the RNA in these complexes argues for the specificity of interaction being observed in the ternary transcription complex. If crosslinking to NusA occurred only because the RNA was tethered to the polymerase through the 3' end of the RNA, then interactions with NusA should also have been observed in the binary complex. The fact that crosslinking to NusA was not observed in the binary complex suggests that the RNA binding region for NusA may not be on the surface of the enzyme, and that only when the RNA is bound in a specific region can interactions with NusA occur.

RNA interactions with the DNA template and the ~. subunit of polymerase
We have been unable to determine whether any of these RNAs interacted with the DNA template. The DNA template becomes radioactively labeled by the core polymerase at nicks and at the free ends in the DNA, even in the absence of irradiation, and the level of this radiolabeling is approximately the same as the level of photocrosslinking to DNA (Hanna & Meares, 1983a,b). Thus, we cannot determine whether the DNA is crosslinked to the RNA simply by comparing the minus and plus irradiation lanes. To address this, experiments would have to be done with an analog similar to that used to examine the DNA contacts made by the 5' end of the KNA (Hanna & Meares, 1983b). This analog had a cleavable bond between the crosslinker and the RNA, and thus the RNA could be cleaved off the radiolabeled DNA after crosslinking, and RNA crosslinking could be determined. Although 5-APAS-UTP can be cleaved using Raney nickel (Hanna et al., 1989), comparable

cleavage of RNA-protein complexes has been unsuccessful. We have recently developed a new analog which is cleavable with DTT, and w e hope to be able to address the issue of DNA-RNA interactions in the future. We have made no mention of the RNA contacts with the rx subunit. Based on earlier work from our g r o u p and others, w e assumed that there was no interaction b e t w e e n the RNA and ~ subunit, and thus the c~subunit was run off the bottom of most of the protein gels used for these studies. However, we have recently determined that in the absence of NusA, the RNA does pass over the c~ subunit as it exits the transcription complex, and this interaction seems to be prevented b y N u s A (Liu & Hanna, 1995). The c~ subunit, like NusA, did not crosslink to the RNA in the polymerase-RNA binary complexes (data not shown).

Nucleotides and enzymes

By incorporating azide-tagged CMP and UMP analogs into RNA of various lengths from four different promoters, we have now observed direct interaction b e t w e e n NusA and the nascent RNA in ternary transcription complexes. This interaction was not dependent u p o n the presence of boxA sequences in the DNA template and did not require that NusA be present at the time of c~factor release. Further, we have shown that the interaction of N u s A with the RNA occurred only in ternary complexes containing the DNA template, and no interaction was observed b e t w e e n NusA and free RNA, or N u s A and RNA in a binary complex with RNA polymerase, but no DNA template.

Materials and Methods
DNA templates

The DNA templates used were as follows: template 1, supercoiled plasmid pSL114-trpt' (Li et al., 1984) containing the E. coli rrnG P2 promoter; template 2, supercoiled plasmid pSL102-trpt' (Li et al., 1984) containing the E. coli rrnG P2 promoter, but without the boxA sequence of template 1; template 3, a DNA fragment prepared by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pAR1707 containing the bacteriophage T7 A1 promoter (Briat & Chamberlin, 1984). The primer end-points relative to the A1 transcription initiation site are -149 and +153; template 4, a DNA fragment containing the bacteriophage pR' promoter with the EcoRI site at position +63 relative to the pR' transcription initiation site (a gift from Dr Jeff Roberts, Cornell University).
Buffers and solutions

All reactions involving 5-APAS-UTP and 5-APAS-CTP were done in reduced light in buffer A. NusA, when included, was present at 200nM. Transcription was initiated from the rrnG P2 promoter of template 1 by incubation with 150 ~tM GpC, 50 nM DNA template and 100 nM RNA polymerase at 32°C for five minutes. Ribonucleotides (40 ~M CTP, 20 ~M ATP, 20 ~tM 3'-OMeATP, 5 ~tM [~-'~2P]GTP (4.4 x 10~cts min -~ pmoI-'), 5 ~M UTP and 150 ~lM 5-APAS-UTP) were then added, and the reaction was incubated at 32°C for five minutes. Transcription complexes were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated in buffer A. Two samples (25 ~1 each) were removed to a control tube or a tube containing NusA, and incubated at 32°C for two and a half minutes. The rest of the purified transcription complexes (100~tl) were extracted once with phenol and once with chloroform. A sample (55 ~tl)was removed from the top of the aqueous layer after extraction with chloroform, precipitated with alcohol, and the pellet was then resuspended in 50 ~ll of buffer A. Two samples (25 ~tl each) were then removed to a control tube or a tube containing NusA, and further incubated at 32°C for two and a half minutes. Samples were irradiated and analyzed, as described below.
Preparation of transcription complexes from rRNA promoters with or without boxA sequences downstream

The buffers and solutions used were as follows: buffer A, 44 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0), 14 mM MgC12, 20 mM NaC1, 14raM ~5-mercaptoethanol, 0.04mM EDTA, 2% (v/v) glycerol; solution B, 25 mM sodium citrate, I mM EDTA (pH 8.0); solution C, 7 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 60 mM DTT, 0.02% (w/v) bromophenol blue, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol; buffer D, 90 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); buffer E, 60 mM Tris-HC1 (pH 8.0), 60 mM DTT, 3.4%

Transcription complexes were prepared from templates 1 and 2 by incubation of 150 ~M GpC, 50 nM DNA template, and 100 nM RNA polymerase at 32°C for five minutes, followed by the addition of 40 ~M ATP, 150 ~M

NusA Contacts RNA in E. coli Transcription Complexes
was incubated with 20 nM Gin Ill protein (kindly provided by Dr Modrich, Duke University) at 37°C for 40 minutes in buffer R. ATP and CTP (100 IIM each), [c~-~2P]GTP (100 IJM, 3 x 10~cts min-' pmol-~), UTP (5 I~M) and 5APAS-UTP (150 ~LM) were added, and the reaction was incubated at 37°C for ten minutes. For photocrosslinking of the intact transcription complex, two samples (20 ~L1 each) of the reaction mixture were transferred to a control tube (without NusA) and a tube containing NusA (200 nM) and incubated at 37°C for two minutes. To analyze crosslinking in a binary polymerase-RNA complex consisting of the RNA and core RNA polymerase, or core plus NusA, the 49 nucleotide long RNA was purified from a urea/10% polyacrylamide gel, as described (Dissinger & Hanna, 1991). The RNA was dissolved in buffer R and samples (2.5 nM) were then incubated on ice for five minutes with NusA (200 nM), core RNA polymerase (10nM), or NusA plus core RNA polymerase using the conditions as described by Altmann et al. (1994). To probe for interactions between the RNA and NusA in the binary complex, NusA was added to the RNA before addition of core, at the same time that core was added, or after addition of core. The samples were then irradiated as described below, and the RNA was digested with ribonuclease TT. The samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, as described below.

5-APAS-CTP, 2 I.LM [c(-32P]GTP (10(' cts rain-' pmol-D and incubation at 32°C for two and a half minutes. The RNA was then elongated by addition of 2 I~M CTP, 8 ~LM UTP, 32 ~LM3'-OMe-UTP and 40 ~lg h e p a r i n / m l at 37°C for five minutes. Samples were irradiated and analyzed, as described below.

Preparation of transcription complexes from the T7 A1 promoter
Transcription complexes containing RNA 20 nucleotides long were prepared from the T7 A1 promoter (template 3), with or without NusA present. In the first set of reactions (I), the 20-mer RNA was internally substituted with 5-APAS-CMP during initiation. The analog was also present during the chase reaction. In the second set of reactions (C), the analog was added only after the 20-mer RNA was formed and NusA was added to the chase reaction. (I), Ternary transcription complexes were prepared by incubation of 150 ~M ApU, 50 nM DNA, 100 nM RNA polymerase and 200 nM NusA at 32°C for five minutes, followed by addition of 20 ~LM ATP, 150 ~tM 5-APAS-CTP, 5 I~M [~-~2p]GTP (3 x 10~cts min-' pmol-') and incubation at 32°C for two and a half minutes. Long RNA was formed by addition of 8 I~M UTP, 32 IJM 3'-OMe-UTP, 5 ~tM CTP and 40 bigheparin / ml; (C), ternary transcription complexes were prepared by incubation of 150 ~LMApU, 50 nM DNA template and 100 nM RNA polymerase at 32°C for five minutes, followed by the addition of 20 ~LM ATP, 20 ~LM CTP, 5 I~M [cz-~2P]GTP (3 x 105 cts min -~ pmol-') and incubation at 32°C for two and a half minutes. The RNA was elongated in the presence of 40 ~=g h e p a r i n / m l , 150 ~LM 5-APAS-UTP and 200 nM NusA. Samples were irradiated and analyzed, as described below.

Photocrosslinking and electrophoresis
For ultra-violet cross-linking, the reactions were split in half; a control sample was kept in the dark at room temperature while the other sample was irradiated at room temperature for two minutes in a polystyrene tube 1.5 cm from a 302 nm light source (Spectroline model XX-15B, 1800 ~LW/cm2 at 15 cm). After irradiation, DTT (to 60 raM) was added to all samples, and they were then left in the dark for at least five minutes. After irradiation, but before protein gel electrophoresis, samples from the irradiated chase reactions were mixed with solution B and 10 units RNase T,/~d and incubated at 37°C for five minutes before analysis by gel electrophoresis. The control and irradiated samples were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiograph~ For RNA analysis, samples were mixed with solution C, heated for three minutes at 94°C, and then analyzed on 40 cm x 0.75 cm 10% or 15% polyacrylamide/ 7 M urea gels (acrylamide/methylene bisacrylamide = 19/1) in buffer D. Autoradiography of RNA gels was at -80°C with Amersham Hyperfilm-MP film utilizing a Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screen. For protein gel analysis, samples were mixed with buffer E and then heated for three minutes at 94°C and analyzed on 12 cm x 0.75 cm SDS/10% polyacrylamide gels with a 4% stacking gel (acrylamide/methylene bisacrylamide = 27/1). Proteins were electrophoretically blotted onto MSI NitroBind nitrocellulose membrane (Westboro, MA) in buffer F. The membrane was then silver-stained in solution H for five minutes and dried. Autoradiography of the membranes was at - 80°C with Amersham Hyperfilm-MP and a Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screen.

Comparison of the 80-mer RNA from T7 A1 containing 5-APAS-CMP or 5-APAS-UMP
Transcription complexes containing RNA 80 nucleotides long (P1 RNA) were prepared as described (Dissinger & Hanna, 1990, 1991). Briefly transcription was initiated at the T7 A1 promoter of template 3 with the dinucleotide ApU, ATP, CTP and [~-32PlGTP. The ribonucleotide UTP, which is encoded at position 21, was omitted. The complexes containing the 20 nucleotide long RNA were separated from unincorporated nucleotides by chromatography on a Sepharose 6B column equilibrated in buffer G. The isolated complexes were adjusted to 10mM magnesium acetate and then divided into two equal portions. For one half of the sample, the 20-mer RNA was elongated further by addition of 20 I-LMATP, 20 I~M CTP, 20 ~M [c(-32P]GTP (8 x 10~ cts min-' pmol-'), and 100 ~lM 5-APAS-UTP and incubation at 30°C for three minutes. For the other half of the sample, the 20-mer RNA was elongated by the addition of 20 ~tM ATP, 5 hiMCTP, 20 ~LM[~-32P]GTP (8 x 105 cts min-' pmol-'), 100 ~M 5-APAS-CTP and 100 I~M 5-APAS-UTP and incubation at 30°C for three minutes. NusA, when included, was present at 36 nM ( N u s A / R N A p o l y m e r a s e = 2 / 1 ) . The samples were irradiated with 302 nm light, and the RNA was then digested with RNase T. (10 units/~l) in solution B at 37°C for five minutes. The samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, as described below.
