By focusing on 4,5-epoxymorphinan, a traditional opioid skeleton but a new structure in the opioid jagonist research field, and by rationally applying the `message-address concept' and `accessory site hypothesis,' we discovered a new chemical class opioid j-agonist, TRK-820 (1). Its development as an antipruritus is now in the final stage. Here, the full scope of its design, synthesis, and structure≠activity relationship are described. ” 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction For the past three decades, considerable efforts have focused on the search for an opioid j-selective agonist without the undesirable morphine-like side effects (e.g., respiratory depression, constipation, physical dependence, etc.). In 1982, U-50488H was discovered to be a highly selective j-agonist.1 Subsequently, several research groups modified its structure and succeeded in preparing more selective and potent j-agonists (Fig. 1).2,3 All these compounds had potent antinociceptive effects in animal models and also lacked the morphine-like side effects. However, the compounds were not developed for clinical use since they, too, had side effects, such as dysphoria and psychotomimetic effects.4 These analogous compounds share a structure similar to the [N-C-CN(sp2)] pharmacophore sequence5 (shaded structures, Fig. 1) of U-50488H. They lack the tyrosine structure which is essential for opioid activity from the viewpoint of endogenous opioid chemistry (Fig. 2). We questioned whether these compounds were authentic j-opioid agonists. Therefore, we designed a new type of non-peptide j-agonist with a novel chemical structure which incorporated tyrosine moiety in order to distinguish the side effects of these prototype j-agonists. Here, we report the design of a j-selective full agonist with the 4,5-epoxymorphinan structure (Chart 1).6,7

1.1. Design rationale Portoghese et al. applied the `message-address concept' for synthesizing selective d- and j-antagonists (Fig. 3: NTI (3) and nor-BNI (4)).8,9 The 4,5-epoxymorphinan skeleton, found in NTI and norBNI, was defined as the message subsite, and is necessary for producing the opioid effects. The other structural site was defined as the address site and is involved in the selectivity of the receptor type. The receptor type selectivity of these opioid antagonists can be regulated by alteration of the structural size of the address site (Fig. 3). The message-address concept was applied to design a selective opioid antagonist, and thus, to design a selective opioid agonist with opposing effects, it was necessary to modify this concept. In general, when an agonist binds a receptor, the receptor can alter its shape to accommodate the structure of the ligand (`induced fit'). This conformational change of the receptor protein would lead to the next signal transduction so that the agonist exhibits its effects. As opposed to an agonist, an antagonist contains a structural element that interferes with the structural change of the receptor. Thus, even if the antagonist binds the receptor, it does not show an effect. The structural site that mediates the interference of `induced fit' is called an `accessory site,' and is usually a highly hydrophobic and sterically hindered site.10 The structural difference between an antagonist and an agonist lies mainly in whether the compound has an accessory site or not. To design a new j-opioid agonist based on the j-selective antagonist nor-BNI, we proposed to remove the accessory site of

nor-BNI, while still maintaining the address structure. The message site of nor-BNI, a 4,5-epoxymorphinan skeleton with a cyclopropylmethyl substituent, could be indispensable for opioid activity because it corresponds to the tyrosine residue found in endogenous opioid peptides. Therefore, we speculated that the accessory site of nor-BNI might be located within the address subsite of this antagonist. A key aspect of our design of a j-selective agonist was to explore which part of the address subsite of nor-BNI corresponded to the accessory site. The meso form analog of nor-BNI (5) has j-selectivity and antagonist activity similar to those of nor-BNI (Fig. 4).11 Further-

more, compound 6, which lacks the phenol ring in the address site of nor-BNI, maintained j-receptor antagonist selectivity comparable to nor-BNI.12 Thus, neither the phenol ring nor the hydroxyl group of the ring junction in the address site of nor-BNI were required for the j-selectivity and antagonist activity. Upon comparing the j-antagonist, compound 6, with naltrexone and NTI, we proposed that the structural distance of the address site from the message site was an essential factor of the address subsite for receptor selectivity (Fig. 3). Bearing this in mind, to design a jselective agonist, the accessory site of compound 6 must be removed while still maintaining the length of the address site for

Based on these ideas for design, a number of compounds were synthesized to attain the proper structural size and length on the side chain (address subsite) for a j-agonist. We found that the side-chain structure of the 6-position had a major influence to receptor selectivity and opioid activity (the SARs are stated below). As a result, we identified compound 1, (2E)-N-[(5R,6R)-17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6-yl]-3-(furan-3-yl)-N-methylprop-2-enamide hydrochloride (TRK-820), which was synthesized from 6b-N-methylnaltorexamine13 (b-7b) and 3-(3-furyl)acryloyl chloride, as a potent and selective jagonist. 2. Results and discussion 2.1. Chemistry For the basic design, we used naltrexone (2) as a starting material because its 6-oxo moiety can be readily modified with various side chains. We synthesized many derivatives to identify the most suitable spacer X, side chain, and stereochemistry. The effects of substitutions at the 17-nitrogen were also examined and various N-alkyl compounds were synthesized starting from noroxycodone (24).14 Scheme 1 shows the synthetic routes for the screening targets. Thioester 14 and thioether 13c were derived from hydroxy intermediates 1215 via SN2-type reactions under the appropriate reaction conditions.16 Etherification and amidation transformations were conducted under typical reaction conditions starting from the corresponding hydroxy15 and amino13,17 intermediates (10 and 7) to give various side-chain derivatives, 11, 1, and 8a≠r. Reduction of amidomorphinan 8a with boran-dimethylsulfide afforded amino compound 9a.

the j-receptor interaction. Therefore, we made the address subsite less-hindered and synthesized compound (A) to couple C6 and X (hetero atom) with a single bond (Fig. 4). This single bond is expected to give structural flexibility to the ligand, so that the structural changes that the receptor undergoes in induced fit will occur easily to express agonist activity.

A derivative of 1 was synthesized starting from the appropriately substituted 6-oxo morphinans obtained from 2 or 24 (Fig. 4).14 2.2. Pharmacology and discussion We screened several compounds for the most appropriate spacer X for opioid j-agonist activity (Table 1). We fixed the side chain at six carbons in length, which is similar to the size of the address part of nor-BNI. Opioid receptor selectivity and agonistic activity were evaluated using electrically stimulated mouse vas deferens (MVD) or guinea pig ileum (GPI) preparations.18 The agonist potencies were expressed as IC50 values, and the receptor selectivity of each test agonist was evaluated by the Ke value. After detecting an opioid agonist activity of the test compounds in vitro, the acetic acid writhing (AAW) test19 using mice was conducted to estimate in vivo potency. We also confirmed that an analgesic effect of the test compounds could be effectively antagonized by pretreatment with the opioid j-antagonist nor-BNI. In the MVD assay, almost all the compounds showed similar agonistic activity. KT-90 and KT-95,20≠22 which have thioester structures, were reported to show opioid j-agonist activity, but 14 showed almost no agonistic activity in vitro or in vivo. This result emphasizes the importance of the chemical structure of the `address' part of the agonist analog. Amide compounds, particularly the N-methyl amido compound 8b, showed the most potent agonistic activity in the AAW test and demonstrated the greatest jselectivity in the MVD assay.

We examined the effects of the introduction of an unsaturated bond and a lipophilic moiety at the side chain in the N-methyl amide derivatives (8c≠8f, Chart 2) on agonist activity and selectivity (Table 2). We also attempted to optimize the length of the side chain. We found an attractive lead compound 8f, a 6b-cinnamamido derivative which showed highly selective opioid j-agonist activity in the MVD assay and pronounced in vivo agonist potency in the AAW test, even by po-administration. Furthermore, the duration of the agonist effect in in vivo tests was adequate. However, 8f showed a weak but significant aversive effect in the rat conditioned place preference (CPP) test (data not shown).23 We then performed a lead optimization study by focusing on the stereochemistry, length, and aromatic ring structure of the side chain. Many derivatives of 8f were synthesized (Chart 2) by condensing a- and b-N-methylnaltrexamine with various carboxylic acids and were evaluated (Table 3). Compounds a- and b-8g were categorized by simple combination of the morphinan structure with U-50488H, since they have a common side chain (3,4-dichlorophenylacetamido). However, their analgesic activities, especially when administered orally, were neither potent nor long lasting. Studies on simple derivatives of the U-50488H chemical structure failed to identify any new drug candidates. Nonetheless, in the course of the lead optimization process, we identified a few trends in structure≠activity relationships. (1) Compounds having the 6bamido structure showed lower sc/po potency ratio and long po≠ duration in the AAW test. (2) The aromatic ring structure in the C6-side chain is one of the most important components to optimize the pharmacological profile, particularly with respect to

attenuation of psychotomimetic effects. Finally, we identified compound 1 as the optimum structure, which was characterized by a furanylacrylamide side chain. Evaluation of the pharmacological profile of 1 revealed that the agonist potency was 6000- and 1800-fold stronger than that of morphine in the MVD and GPI preparations, respectively (Table 4). In comparison to U-50488H, TRK-820, 1 was 140 times and 30 times more potent on GPI and MVD, respectively. According to the l/j ratios of the observed Ke values in the GPI assay, compound 1 was 75 times more effective with j receptors than with the l receptors while U-50488H showed a 390-fold preference for the j receptors. Furthermore, U-50488H was the superior jselective compound as compared to 1 as long as the j1-selective antagonist, nor-BNI,24,25 is used. However, this result suggests that 1 may have an affinity to a j-receptor subtype other than that targeted by U-50488H. Compound 1 was also evaluated for its antinociceptive effects in the AAW and tail flick (TF) methods in mice, and showed high activity in both tests (Table 4). The ED50 values of 1, indicated that this compound was 85≠175 times more potent as an analgesic than morphine and 80≠350 times more potent than U-50488H. This analgesic effect was antagonized only by the jreceptor antagonist, nor-BNI, but not by NTI or by low-dose naloxone.7 Furthermore, 1 was characterized by its low psychotomimetic effect. Morphine showed a significant preferential effect and the test animals appeared to show aversion on U-50488H administration.26,27 In this study, we thus concluded that 1 was neutral and was expected to show less psychotomimetic side effects.28,29 After the identification of 1 as the optimum candidate, we tried to clarify which part of its structure was responsible for its excellent pharmacological profile. The AAW test (sc) in mice was selected to evaluate structure≠activity and structure≠ absorption, ≠distribution, ≠metabolism, and ≠excretion relationships as a whole. Table 5 summarizes the results of a SAR study on the AAW test (sc) of compound 1 derivatives 15≠23. Although, the main factors determining the activity in the AAW test remain to be clarified, our data imply the importance of each feature of the chemical structure of 1. The tyrosine components (17-nitrogen and the 3-hydroxy group) are indispensable for the in vivo activity of 1 and the 17-cyclopropylmethyl, 14-hydroxy, and N-methyl substituents also contribute to its agonist activity. Compound 1 was originally investigated for use as an analgesic to be delivered by iv and im injections for the control of moderate to severe surgical pain. It was concluded that the drug was effective but its safety margin was not as sufficient as was expected from results of animals to conduct further clinical development on this type of pain. Additional nonclinical pharmacological studies demonstrated that Compound 1 at very low doses inhibited itching induced by morphine and Substance P injection.30≠33 Pruritus is a common affliction found in patients maintained on regular hemodialysis, and full development of Compound 1 for uremic pruritus was initiated after confirming its efficacy in the Phase IIa clinical study. Presently, 1 is under application for approval as an antipruritus in Japan.

Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). All reagents and solvents used were of analytical grade from a standard commercial source or were purified by standard methods before use. 4.2. General Melting points were determined on a Yanaco MP-500D melting point apparatus and were uncorrected values. NMR data were taken on VALIAN GEMINI-300 (300 MHz) or JEOL GX-400 (400 MHz) spectrometers and reported in d (ppm) downfield from tetramethylsilane. IR spectra were determined on a JASCO FT/IR5000 spectrophotometer. MS were obtained on a JEOL JES-D-300, JEOL JMS-D-303 or VG ZAB-HF instrument by applying an EI method or a FAB ionization method. Elemental analyses were performed using a Heraeus CHN-ORAPID for carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen; KYOTO ELECTRONICS AT-118 for chlorine; and YOKOGAWA IC7000 for fluorine, bromine, and sulfur. Elemental analyses results were within 0.4% of the theoretical values. The progress of the reactions and purity of the final products were determined on Merck Silica Gel Art.5715. Column chromatography was carried out using Merck Silica Gel (70≠230 mesh). 4.3. Amidation 4.3.1. General method A Naltrexamine derivative 7 and Et3N (3 equiv) were dissolved in CHCl3 (ca. 0.1 M). To this solution, various acid chlorides (2 equiv) were added dropwise at 0 ∞C. After completion of dropwise addition, the reaction solution was stirred for 1 h at rt, followed by the addition of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 for separation. The aqueous layer was then extracted twice with CHCl3. After drying over anhydrous Na2SO4, the combined organic layers were concentrated. The residue was dissolved in MeOH and CHCl3 (ca. 0.2 M). To this solution, K2CO3 (5 equiv) was added at rt, and then stirred

for 30 min at the same temperature. Water and CHCl3 were added to the reaction mixture for separation, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with CHCl3. After drying over anhydrous Na2SO4, the combined organic layers were concentrated. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography or recrystallization. 4.3.2. General method B Compound 7 was dissolved in a solution of water and THF (1:1, ca. 0.2 M). To the solution, Na2CO3 (2 equiv) was added, and the atmosphere of the reaction system was replaced with Ar. Then, acid chloride (1.1 equiv) was dissolved in THF (ca. 1 M) and added dropwise. After stirring for 30 min, MeOH (1/5 volume of the reaction mixture) and 3 N aqueous NaOH (4 equiv) were added and stirred for 1 h. AcOEt and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 were added to the reaction mixture for separation, and the aqueous layer was re-extracted with AcOEt. After washing with brine, the resulting organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography or recrystallization. 4.4.

Opioid receptor selectivity assay Each vas deferens isolated from male ddy strain mice was hung in a Magnus tube, which was maintained at 37 ∞C, filled with a Krebes Henseleit solution (118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.1 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose), and aerated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2. Electric stimulation was applied through upper and lower ring-shaped platinum electrodes (0.1 Hz, 5.0 mS) using the NIHON KOHDEN SEN-7203 electric stimulation system and NIHON KOHDEN SEG-3104 amplifier. Tissue contraction was recorded on a polygraph using an isometric transducer (NIHON KOHDEN WT-687G). Each test compound was added in a cumulative manner to determine the IC50 values (concentration for 50% inhibition of contraction induced by electric stimulation). Next, a solution of antagonists selective for each type of opioid receptor was initially added to the system, and 20 min later, a test compound was added in a cumulative manner. According to the above procedure, the ratio of the IC50 values of the test compound in the presence of the selective antagonists to that in the absence of the selective antagonists was determined. 4.11. Acetic acid writhing method Male mice (5 weeks old) were used in this test. After ip-administration of 0.1 mL of 0.6% aqueous AcOH per 10 g of body weight, the number of writhing reactions occurring in 10 min starting from 10 min after the ip-administration was evaluated as the indicator.

The test compound was administered sc into the rostral back of the animals or po 15 min before the administration of acetic acid. Acknowledgments We thank Dr. Katsuhiko Iseki, Dr. Hidenori Mochizuki, and Dr. Kaoru Nakao (Toray, Kamakura) for helpful discussions. References and notes
