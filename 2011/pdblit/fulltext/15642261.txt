INTERLEUKINS
KLAUS BENDTZEN Laboratory of Medical Immunologyand Department of Medicine TA, State UniversityHospital, Copenhagen, Denmark

INTRODUCTION The mechanism by which the initiation and expression of the immune response are regulated is not completely understood. It has been recognized for many years that antigen-antibody complexes can recruit and activate inflammatory cells either directly or through the activation of the complement system. Numerous observations also indicate that the cellular cooperation is orchestrated by soluble, non-antibody, proteins released from lymphocytes (lymphokines), monocytes and macrophages (monokines), and other cell types engaged in inflammatory reactions. This heterogeneous group of mediators is collectively termed cytokines. Since cytokines are produced in only minute quantities, they first came to be identified by their biological effects in often poorly quantified biological assay systems. Despite these obvious shortcomings, it soon became clear that lymphokines, and monokines as well, are pivotal not only in immune induction and regulation, but also in the expression of lymphocyte functions for instance in immunologically mediated inflammatory reactions [1]. In this presentation, I shall try to review briefly the principal biological roles and properties of the small group of cytokines, the interleukins, which exert important inductive and growth-promoting functions on the immune response. Since space will not permit a detailed discussion of the properties of interleukins from all examined animal species, this review will focus almost exclusively on the molecular biology of the human interleukins. INTERLEUKINS The interleukins may be regarded as lymphocytotrophic hormones of the immune system (see Table 1). In addition, they exert a wide variety of other biological functions. Although the classification and nomenclature of most cytokines are still blurred by our ignorance as to their detailed biochemistry, the molecular biology of the interleukins are now being unraveled. Progress in this field has been advanced considerably by the development of techniques of cell and gene cloning. These include the use of recombinant D N A technology to isolate the genes encoding the interleukins and the use of hybridoma methodology to propagate interleukin-producing cell lines as well as cell lines producing

monoclonal antibodies against each of the known interleukins. This enables the production of larger quantities of the mediators and the rapid purification of selective molecules for sequence analyses and, eventually, clinical use. INTERLEUKIN 1 (IL 1) Mononuclear phagocytes play an essential role in both T- and B-lymphocyte-mediated immune reactions. Monocytes and macrophages not only present antigens in an immunogenic form for T-lymphocytes, they also initiate growth and differentiation of lymphocytes by way of several mediators (monokines). One of these monokines is a polypeptide originally called "soluble reconstituting factor", because it permitted lymphocyte responses in monocyte-depleted, mixed cultures of human lymphocytes [2]. Since then a number of investigators have reported monokine activities capable of modulating lymphocyte behaviour. These activities include "lymphocyte activating factor" which potentiates thymocyte- and T-lymphocyte responses to standard lectins [3], "B-lymphocyte activating factor" which enhances the anti-sheep erythrocyte plaque-forming cell response of B-cell-enriched cultures, "macrophage-derived T-cell replacing factor", "macrophagederived B-cell differentiation factor", "mitogenic protein", "killer-cell helper factor", and many more (see Ref. [4]). Several lines of evidence indicate that these activities are actually different biological manifestations of a single molecule, or a single class of molecules, now termed IL-1 (see Ref. [4]). Recently, it has become increasingly clear that IL-1 is a factor(s) produced by a number of other cell types, although cells of the macrophage lineage appear to be the major source of the mediator (Table 1). Moreover, IL-1 is now believed to exert a number of biologic effects both on lymphoid cells and cells outside the immune system [5]. The spectrum of these activities is shown in Table 2.
Production of IL-1

IL-1 appears to be spontaneously produced by macrophages 1-2 h after isolation in vitro, for instance after attachment to plastic surfaces. IL-1 is not detectable, however, in freshly cultured macrophages indicating that the cells do not normally store the monokine

in its active form [6]. Several stimuli markedly augment the synthesis and/or release of I1-1, such as phagocytic stimuli, mycobacterial membrane glycolipids, phorbol myristate acetate, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Indeed, the amounts of LPS needed for maximal IL-1 production (10-gmg/ml) are so small that, unless extraordinary care is taken, the cell handling and culturing procedures by themselves lead to macrophage activation because of the low levels of LPS contaminating most commercial culture media. Various tumor cell lines with macrophage characteristics also elaborate IL-1, including human acute monoblastic and myelomonocytic leukemia cells [7]. Urine seems to be a potentially rich source of IL-1 [8]. Recently, mRNA extracted from activated rabbit and mouse macrophages has been translated in Xenopus oocytes to form biologically active IL-1 [9]. RNA prepared from unstimulated macrophages does not induce elaboration of IL-1, supporting the view that some kind of activating stimulus must be provided for the initiation of IL-1 production. The production of IL-I seems, at least in part, under the influence of T-lymphocyte regulation since activated T-cells markedly stimulate the synthesis of IL- 1. This is probably due to the production of macrophage-activating lymphokines such as macrophageactivating factor and interferon-gamma (see Ref. [1]). Whether the synthesis of IL-1 is under homeostatic control is unknown, but this may well be the case. Thus, activated T-lymphocytes continue to elaborate lymphokines well into the late G r and S-phase of the cell cycle, and these molecules are capable of down-regulating a number of cell functions (see Ref. [1]).
IL-1 measurement

Traditionally, IL-1 is assayed by its comitogenic effect on murine thymocytes [10], but one may also use its ability to enhance the in vitro plaque-forming cell response to sheep erythrocytes, or its macrophage-replacing capacity in assays for antigen-induced lymphokine responses or lectin-induced proliferative responses [11-14]. The thymocyte mitogenic assay is conducted by culturing murine thymocytes with suboptimal concentrations of T-cell mitogen and different concentrations of IL-1. The resulting proliferative responses, which are dependent upon the levels of IL-1, may be measured by standard techniques. Control thymocytes exposed to IL-1 or T-cell mitogen alone remain at a low level of stimulation. It should be noted that this assay is unsuitable for measuring IL-1 in certain

228

biological fluids because of the presence of suppressor substances in these fluids [15]. In such cases, a human lymphokine-release assay have been used successfully [16].

Chemical characteristics of human IL-1
To date murine IL-! has been the most studied monokine, and a murine tumor cell line-derived IL-1 has been purified and subjected to partial aminoacid analysis. This species of IL-1 is composed of a single polypeptide chain rich in acidic aminoacids. It is remarkably insensitive to digestion by proteolytic enzymes [19]. This could be of considerable pathophysiological importance in view of the fact that IL-1 seems to be pathogenetically involved in inflammatory responses, for instance in rheumatoid arthritis [18, 19]. The biochemical properties of human IL-1 are shown in Table 3.

Biological effects of IL-1
Table 2 shows some of the many effects that have been attributed to IL-1. The classical effect of IL-1 is of course its ability to enhance T-lymphocyte proliferation, an effect shared with IL-2 (see below). In fact, the comitogenic effect of IL-1 is probably caused by its capacity to induce IL-2 production by late Gt phase T-helper lymphocytes [20, 21]. IL-I does not by itself function as a mitogen; in lymphocyte responses triggered by recall antigens, it delivers an activating, second signal to the specifically reactive T-lymphocytes selected from the original population by the antigen-presenting cells. Thus, sensitized T-cells seem to require at least two signals for activation: the first given by adherent cells in an MHC-restricted presentation of the antigen and the second by endogenous IL-1 [5]. Pharmacological interference with the IL-l-mediated second signal may under certain conditions lead to antigen-specific lymphocyte unresponsiveness [22]. This might be of clinical importance, particularly in the field of transplantation and in the management of allergic diseases since the ultimate goal in both cases is the induction of a state of specific tolerance. IL-1 also stimulates antibody production. It is not entirely clear whether this effect is mediated directly to the B-lymphocytes or whether the effect is indirect and mediated by T-lymphocytes activated by IL- 1 to elaborate growth-promoting and

differentiation-inducing lymphokines, such as "B-cell growth factor" and "B-cell differentiation factor". In addition to its effects on lymphocytes, IL-1 has many potentially important functions outside of the immune sysem. As shown in Table 2, leukocytic pyrogen, which is the fever-mediating substance produced by phagocytic cells, is biologically [23] and biochemically [24] similar to, if not identical with, IL-I. Furthermore, IL-1 also stimulates cells involved in the acute-phase response including the increased production by hepatocytes of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (Table 2). IL-! may be pathogenetically involved in several inflammatory disorders because of its stimulatory effects on synovial cells, osteoclasts and chondrocytes (Table 2). A role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint diseases is also suggested by the finding of IL-i like activity in joint fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory joint diseases [25, 61]. In this regard, it is of interest that recent, although indirect, evidence suggests that human IL-1 activity appears to be blocked by zinc-chelators such as penicillamine and gold thiomalate, both well-known remissioninducing drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [26, 27]. It has also been shown recently that the T-cell selective immunosuppressive drug, ciclosporin (cyclosporin A), seems to interfere competitively with the function of IL-1, probably at the level of the T-lymphocyte [28, 29].

INTERLEUKIN 2 (IL-2) Macrophages are essential for T-lymphocyte proliferative responses to recall antigens and T-cell-selective lectins. As shown above, part of this requirement may be substituted by IL-1. The first report suggesting the presence of a proliferative factor in leukocyte cultures appeared in 1965 [37]. It was later realized that conditioned media from PHA-stimulated human lymphocytes supported continuous growth of thymocytes and cord blood lymphocytes as well as proliferation of cytotoxic and suppressor T-lymphocytes [21, 38]. The factors responsible for these effects were termed "lymphocyte mitogenic factor" [38], "thymocyte stimulating- or mitogenic factor" [39, 40], "killer cell helper factor" [40], and "T-cell growth factor" [41]. All these factors, by several criteria, appear to be closely related, if not identical, and as a consequence are now termed IL-2 (see Ref. [4]).

Production of IL-2
The cell responsible for IL-2 production is the T-lymphocyte. The original source of IL-2 was the supernatant of T-lymphocytes challenged by recall antigen [38], but IL-2 may also be obtained from the blood or from spleen cells stimulated by T-cell-selective lectins [42]. IL-2 is also elaborated by blood lymphocytes of boys with X-linked agammaglobulinaemia; these patients are completely deficient in B-lymphocytes [38]. Cell lines with macrophage or B-cell surface markers do not secrete 11-2 [43]. In contrast, the JURKAT ceil line derived from a patient with a T-cell lymphoma is a major source of IL-2 [43]. IL-2-producing normal cell lines have also been established [44]. These cloned T-cell lines seem to lack receptors for IL-2, and they do not proliferate unless a factor resembling IL-3 is provided (see below). This indicates that the T-cell population that produces IL-2 may not be the same as the one that responds to IL-2.

If appropriately stimulated, all known subclasses of T-lymphocytes elaborate IL-2; the T-helper-cell, however, appears to be the major source. IL-2 measurement IL-2 has been shown to maintain exponential growth of PHA-activated human blood T-lymphocytes, alloreactive murine spleen cells, and T-lymphocytes expressing specific cytolytic reactivity. The proliferation of the latter cells is uniquely dependent upon the continuous presence of IL-2. Therefore, IL-2-dependent T-lymphocyte lines are now considered a requirement for unambiguous IL-2 measurement. Other lymphocyte populations may by themselves elaborate IL-2 after various stimuli and thus appear unsuitable as target cells [42]. The IL-2 test itself is a classical lymphocyte proliferation assay the magnitude of which is directly related to the concentration of IL-2. The assay therefore is not only specific for IL-2 but also quantitative and quite reproducible. The recent development of monoclonal antibodies which recognize determinants on IL-2 will not only prove useful in the purification of the mediator by affinity chromatography, but may also be utilized in future enzyme- or radioimmunoassays. Chemical characteristics of human IL-2 As shown in Table 3, the molecular properties of IL-2 have been unravelled in great detail. IL-2 derived from normal T-lymphocytes shows heterogeneity with respect to charge as measured by isoelectric focusing. This heterogeneity is now known to be a result of variable glycosylation, particularly with respect to sialic acid residues, since treatment with neuramindase causes the activity to focus at the highest value of the pI scale, namely 8.2 [451. Within the last few years, IL-2 has been fully characterized with respect to its gene structure, amino acid sequence and postranslational modifications [46, 47]. IL-2 consists of a single, 133 amino acid polypeptide chain containing one disulfide bond. The lymphokine is encoded by a locus on the long arm of chromosome 4 [47], and the amino acid sequence deduced from the cloned cDNA agrees with the purified polypeptide chain structure, except for a putative 20 amino acid promoter sequence [48]. The lymphokine is now being produced in E. coli by recombinant DNA techniques [45]. Interestingly, IL-2 from these various sources differ in their contents of carbohydrates, but not in their biological activity. Thus, postranslational addition of carbohydrates appears to have no influence on the function of the molecule; a notion supported by previous observations that bioactive IL-2 derived from a human T-leukemia cell line is devoid of sugars [42]. Biological effects of IL-2 IL-2 functions as an obligatory signal for T-lymphocyte growth. However, as mentioned previously, an initial signal given by macrophage-processed antigen, alloantigen, or polyclonal lectins is needed not only for the induction of IL-2 production but also for the expression of specific cellular receptors for IL-2 on the responding T-lymphocytes [49]. Thus, resting T-lymphocytes do not express IL-2 receptors until after interaction with the initial stimulator. Once the receptor has emerged, and provided the cells are propagated in serum-containing media, the presence of IL-2 is the limiting factor for proliferation and clonal expansion of the T-lymphocytes.

Interleukins

The essential serum factor appears to be transferrin, since IL-2 activates the Tlymphocytes to develop receptors for transferrin, and the binding of this serum component to the newly formed receptor appears to be essential in order to force the T-cells into the S-phase of the cell cycle (50). A proposed model of these humoral and cellular interactions is depicted in Fig. 1. Results of recent radioreceptor studies indicate that IL-2, and probably also transferrin, may not be the sole requirements for continuous growth of T-lymphocytes [51]. It appears that antigen recognition may be the ultimate regulator of the magnitude of a T-celldependent immune response by directing the IL-2 receptor development. This means that the rate of T-cell proliferation could be dependent upon genetically determined IL-2 receptor biology. The ability of IL-2 to promote and maintain proliferation of T-lymphocytes has been the key to recent technical advances in propagating cloned T-cell lines reactive with specific antigens or alloantigens and cell lines producing large amounts of selective lymphokines. This has also allowed a more detailed study of many general biological phenomena such as hormone-receptor interactions and possible communications between the immune system and the nervous, gastrointestinal and reproductive endocrine systems [52]. INTERLEUKIN 3 (IL-3) AND COLONY-STIMULATING FACTORS (CSF) The term IL-3 was introduced to describe a factor responsible for the induction or expression of 20 alfa hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 alfa SDH) in cultures of splenocytes from nude mice [53]. Like terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), 20 alfa SDH is associated with the T-lymphocyte lineage. The two enzymes, however, seem to distinguish between T-progenitor cells in that TdT and 20 alfa SDH are markers for distinctive subpopulations of T-cells. Only the 20 alfa SDH-carrying T-cell population differentiates into mature T-lymphocytes, provided they have been appropriately stimulated by IL-3 [54].

Functionally, IL-3 appears to be related to a species of other cytokines capable of inducing proliferation and immortalization of bone marrow cells in liquid or soft agar culture [55]. These factors, termed CSF, are produced by T-lymphocyes and by cells of the monocytic lineage. One of these, the basophil/mast cell-growth factor has biological properties similar to IL-3 [54]. Human urine may be a potentially rich source of monocyte/macrophage-derived CSF [56].
BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF INTERLEUKINS

The ability to test the presence and function of the lymphocytotrophic hormones has opened up an exciting area of investigation of the complex cellular and humoral interactions that take place in the central and effector phases of the immune response (see Fig. 1). The structure and function of these crucial intercellular hormones that mediate information between the various cell types involved in the immune response are now being unravelled at the genetic and molecular level. We are also in the position to begin to develop functional, antigenspecific T-lymphocyte lines for the investigation of the molecular basis of antigen- and lectin-binding to lymphocyte receptors. The ability to manipulate in vitro the fine tuning of the T-lymphocyte response is of potentially great significance in immunopharmacology as well. Studies designed to explore the therapeutic potential of purified human interleukins, or of therapeutic measures that interfere with the function of the interleukins, now rest on a more firm theoretical basis. For example, in diseases where IL-1 appears to be pathogenetically involved (e.g. some chronic inflammatory diseases with or without known infectious causes) one might interfere pharmacologically with the function of the interleukins. If this intervention is appropriately timed, this may in some cases lead to the induction of antigenspecific tolerance [22]. The function of IL-1 may be blocked by anti-IL-1 antibodies or immunomodulating drugs [24, 26, 28, 57]. The effects of IL-2 may be blocked by antibodies to the mediator itself [58] or to its specific receptor [59]. Disorders with interleukin-deficiencies are also being recognized with increasing frequency, and scattered clinical trials are now under way using purified interleukins [60]. It is anticipated that the day is not far away when the progress in biotechnology may allow the selection and propagation of specifically reactive subpopulations of human Tlymphocytes which might also be used in antigenspecific immunotherapy.
