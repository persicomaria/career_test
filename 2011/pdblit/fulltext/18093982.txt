THE JOURNAL OF BI OLOGIC AL C HE M IS T RY

THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
Published weekly by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
HERBERT TABOR, EDITOR

Description/Editorial Content
The Journal of Biological Chemistry (JBC) is the most cited biomedical research journal in the world. With over 40,000 pages per year, this weekly publication is the largest and most significant contributor to the fields of biochemistry and molecular biology. In view of the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of biological research, the JBC is broadening our interpretation of "mechanism" to encompass "the molecular processes through which biological functions are carried out." Today, exciting research illuminates the molecular and cellular bases of biological processes in neuroscience, developmental biology, cell biology, medicine, biophysics, immunology, microbiology, and physiology.
