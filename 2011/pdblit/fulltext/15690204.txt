Abstract Conserved glycines, Gly139 and Gly143, in the distal helix of human heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) provide the flexibility required for the opening and closing of the heme active site for substrate binding and product dissociation during HO-1 catalysis. Earlier mutagenesis work on human HO-1 showed that replacement of either Gly139 or Gly143 suppresses heme oxygenase activity and, in the case of the Gly139 mutants, increases peroxidase activity (Liu et al. in J. Biol. Chem. 275:34501, 2000). To further investigate the role of the conserved distal helix glycines, we have determined the crystal structures of the human HO-1 G139A mutant, the G139A mutant in a complex with NO, and the G143H ° mutant at 1.88, 2.18 and 2.08 A, respectively. The results confirm that fine tuning of the previously noted activesite hydrogen-bonding network is critical in determining whether heme oxygenase or peroxidase activity is observed.

Introduction
Heme is the prosthetic group of numerous proteins involved in a diverse range of biological functions such as oxygen transport, electron transfer, energy production and biotransformation of xenobiotics. Free heme, however, is highly toxic. Humans and other organisms have evolved a unique enzyme for the removal of excess heme, heme oxygenase (HO), which utilizes heme as both a prosthetic group and a substrate [1, 2]. The heme is degraded by the enzyme to biliverdin, carbon monoxide and free iron (Fig. 1) [3­5]. In mammals, the heme is cleaved exclusively at the a-meso position to give abiliverdin. The biliverdin is then reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase before it is conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted in the bile. Bilirubin itself is a powerful physiological antioxidant [6]. CO, the second product of the reaction, is now considered to be a gaseous messenger molecule [7, 8]. Finally, the ferrous iron released by HO is normally recycled and serves as the major source of this metal for hemoglobin and other hemoprotein synthesis, since only 1­3% of the iron utilized daily in the synthesis of red blood cells is obtained from the diet [9]. Thus, in addition to its other functions, HO plays a vital role in maintaining iron homeostasis. Mammals contain two HO isoforms, denoted as HO1 and HO-2 [10]. Inducible HO-1 is involved primarily in heme catabolism in the liver and spleen, while the constitutive HO-2 is found in the brain and testes, where it is proposed to function as a generator of CO [11]. Both isoforms contain C-terminal hydrophobic sequences that provide anchors to the microsomal membrane. Expression of soluble, truncated forms of HO-1 that lack the membrane-binding domain while retaining activity [12] has greatly facilitated in-depth mechanistic studies of these enzymes. Most notable were the crystallization and structure determination of the human [13] and rat HO-1 [14] enzymes complexed with heme. The basic HO-1 catalyzed oxidation of heme involves

rapid hydroxylation at the a-meso carbon of the heme, oxygen-dependent fragmentation of the resulting ameso-hydroxyheme to verdoheme, and oxidative cleavage of verdoheme to biliverdin [15]. The first electron provided by NADPH­cytochrome P450 reductase reduces the ferric heme iron to the ferrous state. A molecule of oxygen then binds to form a metastable O2bound complex that is reduced by a second electron to generate ferric­hydroperoxy [Fe(III)­OOHÀ] HO-1 [16]. According to detailed spectroscopic studies [17], the next step is electrophilic addition of the reactive Fe(III)­ OOHÀ species to the heme a-meso carbon. This is in contrast to peroxidases and cytochrome P450 that proceed through a high-valent ferryl [Fe(IV)=O] active intermediate as the reactive hydroxylating species rather than a peroxo ligand capable of attacking the a-meso bridge of the heme (Fig. 1). The exact stoichiometric requirements involved in the formation of ferric verdoheme from a-meso-hydroxyheme have been controversial [18]. Although there is general agreement that this process is oxygen-dependent, the suggestion that additional reducing equivalents are also required [19] has been questioned [20]. The conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin is the least well-characterized step of the overall reaction, although a general mechanism can be proposed [16]. Three conserved glycines in the distal helix of HO-1 (Gly139, Gly143 and Gly144) are thought to provide the flexibility required for catalysis. Crystals of human HO1 contain two molecules per asymmetric unit and the conserved Gly residues are likely responsible for the distal helix adopting different conformations in the two HO-1 molecules [13]. In one molecule the active-site pocket is more open with relatively loose distal helix­ heme contacts, while in the other molecule the contact between the heme and the distal helix is tighter. In addition, structures of both rat and human HO-1 in the apo form and in a complex with bilverdin and various diatomic ligands [14, 21­27] suggests that flexibility of the distal helix enables the heme pocket to undergo the opening/closing motions required for substrate binding and product release. However, unlike the globins and peroxidases, the distal HO-1 active site does not have a histidine or other polar residues positioned to stabilize

iron-bound ligands. The only polar moieties that are sufficiently close to directly hydrogen bond to the distal water are the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen of Gly139 and Gly143, respectively [13]. Mutagenic studies on human HO-1 [28] have shown that replacing either Gly143 or Gly139 with larger aliphatic, aromatic, or charged side chains, renders the enzymes inactive. In some mutants the enzyme acquires peroxidase activity and is able to form a ferryl intermediate and to turn over a traditional peroxidase substrate, guaiacol, in the presence of H2O2. To obtain a better understanding of the oxygen activation mechanism and the role of the conserved distal helix glycines, we have determined the crystal structures of the human HO-1 G139A mutant and, as a mimic of the oxy complex, its NO complex and the crystal structure of the inactive G143H mutant. NO is generally considered to be a good mimic of oxy complexes including HO. For example, the one known crystal structure of an HO­oxy complex, the HO from Corynebacterium diphtheriae [29], is very similar to the HO-1­NO complex [30] including the water-mediated hydrogen-bonded network.

Materials and methods
Bacterial expression and protein purification The G139A mutant, G143H mutant and wild-type enzyme of the truncated water-soluble form of recombinant human HO-1 were expressed, purified and reconstituted with hemin according to previously published procedures [28, 31, 32]. Crystallization Human HO-1 mutant and wild-type crystals were grown under conditions similar to those previously described [13] using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method with a well solution of 2.08 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N¢-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5) and 0.9% 1,6-hexanediol. The drops consisted of protein stock (5 ll) at 45 mg mlÀ1 in

140

20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), mixed with well solution (5 ll) on siliconized cover slips. The only difference here is that all crystals were grown at room temperature instead of 28°C and one round of touch seeding using crushed wild-type crystals was necessary to initiate mutant crystal growth. For cryogenic data collection D-(+)-trehalose was used as the cryoprotectant. Cryogenic data collection involved a seven-step transfer of crystals to an artificial precipitant solutions with increasing D-(+)-trehalose concentration up to 35% (w/ v). Wild-type human HO-1 crystals belong to the monoclinic space group, P21, whereas mutant crystals grew in two different forms: one form belonging to the orthorhombic space group P212121 and the other to a monoclinic space group, P21. The cell dimensions of all crystal forms are listed in Table 1. Since the P212121 form diffracts much better, all data were obtained from P212121 crystals. Generation of NO complexes

soaking with 20 mM dithionite and 10­20 mM sodium nitrite for at least 40 min inside a glove box before being flash-frozen for data collection. Data collection Data were collected using an in-house R-AXIS IV imaging plate detector equipped with a rotating copper anode X-ray generator with Osmic optics (Rigaku). Crystals were maintained at À160°C in a stream of nitrogen (Crystal Logic, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Optimization of data collection was guided by the STRATEGY function of MOSFLM [33]. All data were reduced using HKL 2000 [34] and rejections were performed with ENDHKL (Louis Sanchez, California Institute of Technology) in conjunction with SCALEPACK. For all the crystals, a 180° scan using 1° frames was collected. Model building and refinement

Crystals of G139A were passed stepwise through the normal (as described earlier) seven-step transfer to artificial precipitant solution with increasing D-(+)-trehalose concentration up to 35% (w/v). The cryoprotectant solution and the cryo-soaked crystals were subjected to anaerobic treatment by cycling between extensive degassing and purging with pure N2 gas for 45­60 min. Fresh dithionite and sodium nitrate solutions were made with the degassed cryoprotectant solution in sealed serum vials. NO-complexed crystals were prepared by

The G139A and G143H human HO-1 structures in space group P212121 were determined by the method of molecular replacement using AmoRe [35]. A monomer of the human heme­HO-1 crystal structure (PDB accession number 1qq8) [13] with the heme and waters removed was used as the probe with searches being ° carried out at 5 A in the P212121 space group. The best cross rotation and translation function solutions were rigid-body-refined and fixed in place followed by a

search for the remaining molecule in the asymmetric unit. A total of two solutions was found, corresponding to the expected two monomers per asymmetric unit. The final R factor was 42 and 39% with a correlation coefficient of 59 and 69%, respectively, for G139A and G143H. These structures and the other structures presented here were further refined in CNS [36]. Protein atoms were initially refined by simulated annealing, followed by a few cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and water picking. Finally, temperature factors were refined. No restraints for noncrystallographic symmetry were applied. The program O [37] was used for further adjustment and modeling of protein atoms, ligands and water molecules. Backbone geometry was checked in PROCHECK [38] and none of the residues were in the disallowed region. Diffraction and refinement statistics for all the structures are summarized in Table 1.

Results
Gly139Ala structure The mutant crystallized in an orthorhombic space group P212121 compared to the monoclinic space group P21 found for the wild-type enzyme. As with the wild-type structure we observe two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the G139A structure. In the P21 space group the active site in one molecule in the asymmetric unit is more

open. However, in the P212121 space group both HO-1 molecules are in the ``closed'' conformation. Figure 2 shows the 2Fo­Fc electron density around the site of the mutation and the position of key waters. The most striking difference between the mutant and the wild type is a repositioning of the heme (Fig. 3). The mutant heme drops down and rotates away from the distal helix. This is very likely due to steric crowding between the mutant Ala139 side chain and the heme. This movement of the heme also requires a slight repositioning of the proximal helix and the His25 heme ligand in order to maintain proper His25­heme interactions (Fig. 3). A comparison of the closed wild-type and G139A molecules is presented in Fig. 4. In the closed molecule of the wild-type structure, the carboxylate side chain of Asp140 forms a set of hydrogen bonds/ionic interactions with Tyr58, Arg136 and a nearby water molecule, Wat1. This nearby water molecule also interacts with the carbonyl oxygen of Thr135 via a second water molecule, which we will refer to as Wat2 (Fig. 4). Wat1 is thought to be important in HO-1 catalysis since in the wild-type ° structure Wat1 is only 3.3 A from the distal water (Wat0) ligated to the heme iron [13] (Fig. 4), which suggests that Wat1 may be part of a proton shuttle system that participates in protonation of the Fe­oxy complex. In the G139A mutant, these interactions are disrupted (Fig. 4). The side chain added at position 139 in the G139A structure replaces Wat2. In the wild-type enzyme Wat2 forms an important set of hydrogen bonds with Wat1, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr135, and is in ° contact distance with the side chain of Asp140 (2.4 A) and the carbonyl oxygen of Arg136. In the G139A structure the Ala139 side chain is only able to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Thr135 at a ° distance of 2.9 A (Fig. 4).

Another important difference between the two activesite structures is the location of Wat1. In the wild-type ° enzyme Wat1 is 3.3 A from the distal water, Wat0, and hydrogen-bonds with the Asp140 side chain. In the mutant Wat1 is positioned further out of the active-site ° ° pocket and 4.1 A from Asp140 and 6 A from Wat0. In the mutant Wat3 is the only water molecule hydrogenbonding with the Asp140 side chain (Fig. 4). In the G139A heme active-site structure we also observe a new ° water molecule, Wat4, 3.5 A from Wat0. This change in solvent structure is very likely associated with an increase in the volume of the distal side pocket by ° approximately 80 A3 in the mutant owing to movement of the heme. Structure of the ferrous G139A­NO complex In the G139A­NO complex both molecules in the asymmetric structure bind NO as evidenced by the strong difference density in the distal coordination position. However, the density is more well resolved and easily interpreted in molecule A (Fig. 5) and, hence, the following discussion will be confined to molecule A. As in the ferric structure, the heme in the mutant­NO complex has moved and rotated away from the distal helix and the site of mutation. Again, as in the wild type­NO complex, the NO ligand is bent and leans towards the a-meso carbon of the heme with a bend angle of 142° (\Fe2þ ÀN À O) compared with 138° in the wild-type enzyme [30]. In the wild type­NO

complex the leaning of the NO ligand towards the ameso carbon of the heme was largely due to an espe° cially close 2.7-A contact between the NO oxygen and the carbonyl O atom of Gly139. In the G139A­NO ° complex this distance has increased to 3.3 A. The distance between the oxygen of NO and the a-meso car° bon of the heme is 4.30 A, which is somewhat longer ° than that determined in the wild-type complex, 4.03 A [30]. In the wild-type NO complex NO is stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds involving Tyr58, Asp140, Wat1, Wat2 and Thr135 (Fig. 5). The NO oxygen hydrogen-bonds with Wat1 which, in turn, forms hydrogen bonds with the catalytically critical Asp140 (Fig. 5). Through Wat1 and Wat2 NO is also able to interact with the carbonyl group of Thr135 (Fig. 5). In the G139A­NO complex the interaction between Wat1 and Wat2 is lost since the Ala139 side chain both takes the place of Wat2 and forces Wat1 to move further from Asp140 owing to steric crowding. As a result we observe a different hydrogen-bonding network that is able to deliver a proton to the terminal oxygen in the mutant structure compared with that in the wild-type enzyme. In G139A­NO the side chain of the catalytically critical Asp140 no longer directly hydrogen-bonds with Wat1, but is able to interact with Wat1 through Wat3 (Fig. 5). In the wild type­NO complex Wat3 is able to hydrogenbond with the Asp140 side chain but not with Wat1. Furthermore, the presence of the Ala139 side chain also prevents the carbonyl oxygen of Thr135 from interacting with Wat1.

Gly143His structure Like G139A, the G143H mutant also crystallized in an orthorhombic space group P212121 containing two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Figure 6 shows the 2Fo­Fc electron density around the site of the mutation and the position of key waters. The most striking difference we observe between G143H and the wild-type structure is the formation of a bis-histidine complex when Gly143 is replaced with a His. This is consistent with spectroscopic studies that show that the G143H mutant is six-coordinate low-spin [28]. In the crystalline state we were unable to form the G143H­NO complex. Even during long soakings with elevated concentrations of NO we were unable to displace His143 from the heme iron to allow NO to bind (data not shown) although the CO and O2 complexes apparently form in solution [28]. In hindsight, it is not surprising that the G143H mutant His side chain coordinates to the heme iron. There are very few favorable orientations that the mutant His side chain can adopt other than coordinating to the iron. The various favored rotomers result in steric clashes except for a Ca­Cb dihedral angle of approximately 170° which orients the His side chain for proper iron coordination. The coordination geometry of the new H143 side chain is not optimal since the His plane forms about a 30° angle with heme plane compared with about 10° for the H25 ligand. Moreover, the two His ligand imidazole rings are not parallel as in cytochrome b5 but instead form an angle of about 45°. Not surprisingly, coordination of the mutant His side chain causes large changes in solvent structure (Fig. 6).

In addition to the solvent ligand, Wat0, being displaced, Wat1 also is absent, leading to a complete disruption of the Wat1, Wat2, Asp140, Arg136, Tyr58 and Thr135 hydrogen-bonded network found in the wild-type structure. The hydrogen-bonding interactions with Arg136 and Tyr 58 are maintained in the mutant structure. Lastly, we again observe a flatter heme in G143H than in the wild-type structure.

Discussion
HO shares common properties with monooxygenases such as P450 and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) as opposed to peroxidases. While peroxidases utilize a nearby His residue as an acid­base catalytic group that assists in heterolytic fission of the peroxide O­O bond [39, 40], HO, P450 and NOS have no residue close enough to dioxygen that can serve a similar function. Instead, all these heme monooxygenases utilize a network of ordered active-site water molecules that provide a hydrogen-bonding bridge between the dioxygen ligand and the protein. Presumably this network is needed for the proper delivery of protons to the ironlinked dioxygen that is required for dioxygen activation. Unlike P450 and NOS, however, HO does not cleave the O­O bond to give the Fe(IV)=O intermediate as the active oxidizing agent. Instead, the HO­ oxy complex is reduced to the peroxide level and it is the iron-linked peroxide that serves as the active hydroxylating agent [16]. A key question is how HO-1 tips the balance of O2 activation chemistry in favor of

145

using Fe(III)­peroxy as the hydoxylating agent over the more common Fe(IV)=O. The HO-1 mutants have been critically important in providing insights into this question. One of the more important residues to be targeted is Asp140, which participates in a solvent-mediated hydrogen-bonding network thought to be important for oxygen activation [27, 30, 41] (Fig. 4). The D140A mutant is inactive as a HO but exhibits peroxidase activity approximately 160fold larger than wild-type HO-1 [42]. Cryo-reduction/ annealing experiments have shown that wild-type HO-1 first forms the Fe(III)­OOHÀ intermediate that serves as the active hydroxylating agent [43]. Theoretical studies support this view except a two-step process is favored where the peroxide O­O bond homolytically cleaves followed by rapid addition of the hydroxyl radical to the a-meso carbon [44]. However, the D140A mutant first forms the Fe(III)­OO2À intermediate under conditions where the wild-type forms Fe(III)­OOHÀ and much higher annealing temperatures are required to form the Fe(III)­OOHÀ species in the mutant. These results indicate that the D140A mutant is impaired in its ability to protonate Fe(III)-OO2À. The crystal structure of the D140A HO-1 mutant in a complex with NO [30] shows that the ligand still maintains a similar wild-type hydrogen-bonded network between the NO and activesite water molecules, but a new water takes the place of the missing Asp140 side chain. It thus appears that the precise donor/acceptor hydrogen-bonding relationship in the solvent network is controlled to a large extent by Asp140, and that Asp140 properly tunes the hydrogenbonding energetics such that the water molecule directly hydrogen-bonded to the distal O atom of Fe(III)­OO2À serves as a proton donor. The decrease in stability of Fe(III)­OOHÀ in the D140A mutant [43] further underscores the importance of the precise hydrogenbond donor/acceptor relationship for proper catalysis. Owing to such destabilization in the D140A mutant, the Fe(III)­OOHÀ intermediate can more readily accept a second proton to give the Fe(III)­OOH2 product that then undergoes heterolysis to give the peroxidase-active Fe(IV)=O species. The G139A mutant investigated here has a less drastic effect. This mutant retains about 60% of the wild-type HO activity and exhibits an approximately 12-fold increase in peroxidase activity. The crystal structure of the G143A mutant­NO complex shows that the Asp140­water­NO hydrogen-bonded network remains largely intact except that two water molecules rather than one, as in the wild type­NO complex, form a bridge between Asp140 and NO. It thus appears that the HO catalytic mechanism can tolerate a change in solvent structure and repositioning of the heme such that Asp140 need not directly hydrogen-bond with the water that donates a proton to Fe(III)­OO2À. Even so, the increase in peroxidase activity indicates that the Fe(III)­OOHÀ intermediate is less stable in the G139A mutant, presumably owing to the disruption the precise hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor relationship in the

Asp140­water hydrogen-bonded network. In particular, the increase in active-site volume owing to movement of the heme may increase the chance for nonspecific protonation of the Fe(III)­OOHÀ intermediate by bulk solvent, resulting in heterolytic cleavage of the O­O bond.
