$Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology University of Shefield Shefield SlO ZTN, U.K. (Received 7 March 1991; accepted 27 June 1991) The structure and crystal chemical properties of iron cores of reconstituted recombinant human ferritins and their site-directed variants have been studied by transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction. The kinetics of Fe uptake have been compared spectrophotometrically. Recombinant L and H-chain ferritins, and recombinant H-chain variants incorporating modifications in the threefold (Asp131 -+ His or Glu134 + Ala) and fourfold (Leu169 + Arg) channels, at the partially buried ferroxidase sites nucleation site on the inner surface (Glu62,His65 + Lys,Gly), a putative (Glu61,Glu64,Glu67 + Ala), and both ferroxidase and nucleation sites the (Glu62,His65 + Lys,Gly and Glu61,Glu64,Glu67 + Ala), were investigated. An additional H-chain variant, incorporating substitution of the last ten C-terminal residues for those of the L-chain protein, was also studied. Most of the proteins assimilated iron to give discrete electron-dense cores of the Fe(II1) hydrated oxide, ferrihydrite (Fe,OJ.nH,O). No differences were observed for variants modified in the three- or fourfold channels compared with the unmodified H-chain ferritin. The recombinant L-chain ferritin and H-chain variant depleted of the ferroxidase site, however, showed markedly reduced uptake kinetics and comprised cores of increased diameter and regularity. Depletion of the inner surface Glu residues, whilst maintaining the ferroxidase site, resulted in a partially reduced rate of Fe uptake and iron cores of wider particle size distribution. Modification of both ferroxidase and inner surface Glu residues resulted in complete inhibition of iron uptake and deposition. No cores were observed by electron microscopy although negative staining showed that, the protein shell was intact. The general requirement of an appropriate spatial charge density across the cavity surface rather than specific amino acid residues could explain how, in spite of an almost complete lack of identity between the amino acid sequencesof bacterioferritin and mammalian ferritins, ferrihydrite is deposited within the cavity of both proteins under similar reconstitution conditions.

1. Introduction The iron storage protein, ferritin, comprises a spherical shell of 24 polypeptide subunits surrounding an inorganic core of hydrous iron (III) oxide (Ford et aZ., 1984; Thomas et al., 1988). The functional specificity of the protein is considered to 7 Aut,hor to whom all correspondence should be addressed

be due to several factors. These include selective transport of reactants into the protein shell via molecular channels, site-specific catalytic oxidation of Fe(I1) and nucleation of the Fe(II1) oxide on the cavity surface (Harrison et al., 1989). Most of the earlier studies, however, used horse-spleen ferritin which, like most ferritins, is a heteropolymer of two types of polypeptide chain, designated H and L (Arosio et al., 1977).

V. J. Wade et al. the stabilization of incipient nuclei (Ford et /cl.. 1984: Mann et al.. 1986). A potential candidate for such a nucleation centre is the inner surface grouping of residues Glu61 ,Glu64,Glu67 which are conserved in both H and L-chains and are known to serve as ligands for metal binding (Harrison et al.. 1987, 1989; Lawson et al., 1991). In the work presented here we have investigated the influence of homopolymer types and sitrdirected modifications in recombinant ferritins on the reconstitution of iron cores in uitro. WC describe the crystal chemical properties of the reconstituted cores and their corresponding kinetics of iron uptake. We have det'ermined the structure. size and shape of cores deposited in rLF, rHF snd rHF variants altered in threefold or fourfold channel sites, depleted in ferroxidase activity and/or modi fied in respect, t'o the putative nuclea.tion sit,<' described above. The result,s indicate that extensircb modifications need to be made to the protein shell in order to prevent core formation. The amino acid modifications studied did not influence the structure of the iron biomineral although the absencae of tht, ferroxidase centre ligands resulted in a small, but significant, increase in core diamet,er. The effect of' these modifications on the kinetics of a multi-step pathway to core formation is discussed.

identity in amino acid sequences (Soyd et al., 19%) it has been difficult to assess in detail the structure/ function properties of the molecule. Recent successes in expressing recombinant human H-chain (rHFt: Levi et aE., 1987, 1988) and recombinant human L-chain (rLF: Levi et al., 19898; Thomas et al., 1988) homopolymer ferritins in Escherichia eoli, combined with structural studies (Lawson et al., 1989, 1991), have resulted in significant advances in our understanding of the functional differences in these subunit types. Although both homopolymers had the capacity to incorporate iron, rHF exhibited iron uptake and ferroxidase kinetics severalfold faster than rLF (Levi et al., 1988, 1989b). Lawson et al. (1989, 1991) have identified the ferroxidase centre ligands as Glu27, Glu62 and His65 which are embedded within each of the four-helix bundles comprising the subunits. Together with several neighbouring residues, these amino acids are present in all known H-chains but absent, in ferritin L-chains. Site-directed modifications, namely Glu62 -+ Lys and His65 -+ Gly (H to 1, subunit changes), resulted in complete loss of ferroxidase activity in the rHF protein although core formation did occur, albeit slowly, at pH 7.0. Engineering of rHF ferritins at sites other than the ferroxidase centre has been undertaken (Levi et al., 1989a; Treffry et al., 1989). Interestingly, modifications in the H and L-chain conserved hydrophilic threefold channel (Aspl31. Glul34 -+ His) resulted in a 70% reduction in the rate of core formation (Treffry et al., 1989) whilst a change in the hydrophobic fourfold channel (His173 -+ Leu: H to I, subunit change) had minimal effect' on Fe uptake (Levi et al., 1989a). The studies on recombinant ferritins suggest that one possible mechanism of selective Fe uptake lies with the specific H-chain ferroxidase activity (Levi et al.. 1989b, Lawson et aZ., 1989, 1991). The proposed Fe(I1) oxidation site is approximately seven to ten a (1 A = @I nm) from the internal surface and communication with the external and internal environments may be possible by means of narrow channels through the interior of the subunits: this channel is blocked in L-chain ferritins (Lawson et aE., 1991). However, it is significant that iron (*ores can be reconstituted in vitro under relat,ively high Fe/protein ratios in ferritins lacking ferroxidase cent'res (Levi et al.. 19896; Lawson et aZ.. 1989). This suggests that the inner surface of the cavity has a nucleation capacity higher than that in bulk solut'ion since non-specific hydrolytic polymerization is not generally observed. Although a specific nucleat'ion centre has not been identified, carboxylate ligands have been implicated in several studies (Chasteen & Theil, 1982; Levi et al., 1989a; Treffry et al.. 1977: Wetz C% Crichton, 1976; Yang et al., 1987). One possibility is that a cluster of carboxylate residues on t,he inner surface serves as a domain for

and Methods

Human rHF and rLP were expressed and isolated ar previously described (Levi et al., 1988, 19896: Treffry (4 al., 1989). Rat rLF was obtained according to Thomas rf CLZ. (1988). Human liver ferritin (HLF: Levi rt al.. 1988) and human brain ferritin (HBF: Dedmnn, Treffry K: Harrison. unpublished results) were prepared by st,andard methods. Human rHF variants were obtained. purified and treated for iron removal according to methods described (Luzzago & (:esareni. 1989: Levi et al.. 1987.
1988. 1989a).

Apoferritins were reconstituted by addition of ferrous ammonium sulphate solutions under controlled conditions to give calculated loadings of 2000 Fe atomsjmolec~ulr (Macara it a/.. 1972). Where possible. variants and controls were reconstituted on the sa,me day using t'hr same batch solutions. In all, 3 methods were used. (i)

Method 1

Reconstitution of apoferritins (CF.5 to I mg/ml) 111 tb I >IHepes (pH 7.0) was achieved by the addition of 2 inure ments of I.0 to 2.0 mM-(Pu`H,),Fe(SO,), solution. 20 min apart. at room temperature. The prot,ein solutions were kept at 4'C' for 18 h and then dialysed against 1 tnMdesferrioxamine to remove any non-specific oxidation products followed by dialysis against 50 rnM-Hepes (pH 7.0). A similar procedure but using apoferritins (0.2 mg/ml) in 0.1 M-MOPS (pH 7.0) and without, desferrioxamine treatment, was also used. (ii) Meth,od

In all 3 methods the kinetics of Fe uptake were determined spectrophotomrtrically at 310 nm as described by Levi et al. (1988).

Unstained samples of reconstituted proteins were prepared for electron microscopy by air-drying small drops of a solution of the sample onto nitrocellulose/ carbon-coated copper electron microscopy grids. These were examined in a Jeol 2OOOFX transmission electron microscope operating at 100 keV. Electron diffraction patterns were recorded from selected areas well-covered with ferritin cores in order to obtain high diffraction intensities. A calibrated camera length of 80 cm was used. Measurements of core diameters were made with callipers from enlarged electron micrographs. Particle size distributions were made by measurement of 50 protein iron-cores. Stained images of protein molecules were obtained by incubating electron microscopy grids containing air-dried samples with 1.501; (w/v) sodium silicotungstate solution for 1 min at room temperature followed by washing with distilled water.

Electron diffraction patterns from both samples were similar, consisting of four or five lines at d spacings, @25 nm, 0.228 nm, 0.204 nm and @I 5 nm. Reconstitution by method 3 compared with method 1 gave better-resolved lines indicative of increased crystallinity. However, in all casesthe structure of the iron cores was consistent with the mineral, ferrihydrite (9Fez0, .5H,O) (Towe & Bradley, 1967). There were some significant' differences in shape and size of the iron cores independent of the method of reconstitution. Human rHF cores were smaller in mean diameter (Table 1) than the rLF cores and were generally irregular in morphology. By contrast, there was a distinct population of large cores in reconstituted rLF that were spherical in shape. The particle size distribution of rLF was shifted to higher core diameters than for rHF and there was evidence of a slightly bimodal distribution in the former (Fig. 3). The iron cores of rat rLF (Fig. 3, Table 1) mirrored those of human rLF but with an even larger mean diameter possibly due to the change in reconstitution procedure. Comparison of recombinant homopolymers with reconstituted native proteins of variable H/L ratio were in general agreement with the observation that an increased percentage of the L-chain resulted in larger, well-defined iron cores. For example, using reconstitution method 3, rHF, HBF and HLF gave discrete electron-dense cores (Fig. 2) with the mean core diameters increasing in the sequence rHF < HBF < HLF (Table 1, Fig. 3). Furthermore, HLF, unlike rHF and HBF, exhibited a bimodal distribution similar to rLF. These differences were not so apparent, however, for reconstitution method 1 (Table 1). (b) rH F variants Table 2 lists the recombinant human rHF variants used in this study. They include a crystallization variant involving a modification (Lys86 + Gln: Treffry et al., 1989, Lawson et al., 1989) which was further modified in the threefold channels (Asp131 -+ His or Glu134-+Ala) (Treffry et al.. centre 1989), depleted of the ferroxidase (Glu62,His65 -+ Lys,Gly: Lawson et al., 1989), or

Modifications to the rHF protein included changes in the fourfold channel (Leu169 -+ Arg or His173 -+ Leu) (Luzzago & Cesareni, 1989; Levi et al., 1989a) and depletion of the putative nucleation site (Glu61,Glu64,GIu67 -+ Ala: Arosio, unpublished results). Previous iron uptake data (Levi et al., 1989a. Treffry et al., 1989) have shown that the crystallization and fourfold channel variants exhibit kinetic properties similar to those of rHF, and modifications in the threefold channel appear partially to reduce the rate of Fe uptake. A significant reduction was observed for the variant depleted of three inner surface glutamate residues (Fig. 1). By contrast, markedly reduced kinetics were observed for the variant lacking ferroxidase activity (Fig. 1) although core formation did appear to take place. However, the variant modified in both the ferroxi-

GluCi7 -+ Ala, however, resulted in a broadening of the core size distribution due to an increased number of cores with diameters less than 3.5 nm (Fig. 5). Thus: although modification of the inner surface glutamate residues results in significant kinetic reduction of iron uptake, the variant remains functional presumably through its retained ferroxidase centre. Mutations superimposed on the loop (crystalliza-

tion) modification resulted in discrete electron-dense cores when imaged in the electron microscope (Fig. 4). No structural differences were observed for different variants and the electron diffraction data were identical to the ferrihydrite pat,terns obtained for the rHF-derived proteins. Mean core sizes and particle size ranges are shown in Table 3. There was some variability in the absolute values of these data from samples reconstituted by different methods or

inner surface glutamate residues do diminish Fc uptake kinetics, but cores of normal ferrihydritr structure still form and it is only when changes in both regions are combined that the prot,ein fails to take up iron. The ability of ferritin to compete effectively with
bulk precipitation is a kinetic effect dependent on

even by the same method but on different days. However, the same relative trends were observed. Changesin the threefold channels gave a marginal reduction in the mean core size and shifted the size distribution to lower values compared with the control sample (crystallization variant: Table 3). Experiments with the ferroxidase-depleted variant resulted in a significant increase in the mean core dimension compared with the control samples (Table 3). There was a distinct population of cores above six nm in diameter and the particle size distribution was bimodal (Fig. 5). Interestingly, a sample of rLF reconstituted in these experiments had almost identical mean core size and distribution to that of the ferroxidase-depleted variant (Table 3) indicating a close similarity between these two proteins. Reconstitution of the variant modified at both the ferroxidase and inner surface glutamate sites resulted in non-specific bulk oxidation and precipitation. Examination of the protein by electron microscopy failed to identify reconstituted cores. However, counter-staining of the grids with sodium silicotungstate showed the presence of intact. unloaded apoferritin molecules (Fig. 4). Gel electrophoresis of this variant was consistent with these results (data not shown). The results indicate that these extensive modifications give rise to protein with conserved quaternary structure but depleted in functional activity.

4. Discussion
The results presented here indicate that sitedirected modifications in the threefold and fourfold channels, ferroxidase centre and inner surface residues of recombinant H-chain ferritin can be accomplished without loss of functional potential. Although alterations in these regions can have varying, often minor, effects, a remarkable number of changes can be tolerated. Thus amino acid substitutions within the fourfolds channels have no significant effect on rates of iron uptake, mean core size or structure. Changeswithin the threefold channels produce only a modest decrease in iron incorporation rates and clearly do not alter the ability to nucleate ferrihydrite cores. Alterations in the ferroxidase centre ligands or, to a lesserextent, the

oxidation and/or nucleation processes (Fig. 6). Clearly, when the ferroxidase centres are intact, Fe(H) is rapidly oxidized and the increased localized supersaturation leads to rapid ferrihydrite deposition within the cavity. Provided that) this process is not limited by diffusion or nucleation processes,iron oxide precipitation will be specific t'o the protein. Furthermore, in homopolymer molecules which contain the same number of ferroxidase cmtrrs. most of the added Fe(IT) will be distributed essen tially equally amongst all the molecules. Tn t,hcl absenceof the ferroxidase centres, deposition wit.hin the cavity can only be competitive with bulk pre cipitation if Fe(U) is preferentially sequestered by, the protein and/or st,abilization of the Fe(W) nuclei is enhanced. Tn both cases. the presence of carboxy late ligands such as the conserved Glucil, Glu64,Glu67 residues may be important, either as metal ion binding sites or as negatively cha,rged domains that lower the activation energy of cluster formation. Under such conditions. ferrihydrit,c formation will be relatively slow compared with the ferroxidase mechanism as shown by the ma,rked kinetic differences of iron uptake in rHF and rLF proteins. Moreover, a slower nucleat,ion-drivers process in rl,F can lead to discrimination between molecules because statistically some molecules will contain nuclei prior to others and these will develop at the expense of molecules without nuclei by aut)ocatalytic growth processes. Thus some molecules may remain empt,y whilst) others attain a relatively large particle size. These observations are in agreement with previous findings that' the population of naturalI> occurring human ferritins of low iron content contained mainly L-chain polypeptides (Arosio rf al., 1977). Presumably, in heteropolymer ferritins of variable H/L ratio. both oxidation and uucleation processesare operative at rates depending on the relative percentage of H and L-chains.

different biological environments is thus feasible through selection of different subunit compositions. Modification of the ferroxidase ligands, Glu62 and His65, results in a variant analogous to the rLF homopolymer in its low rate of Fe uptake and somewhat increased mean particle size. Although the cavity surfaces of rLF and rHF are very different with respect to their amino acid composition (only 56% of these residues are identical in human ferritins) both molecules contain the three glutamate residues, Glu61,Glu64,Glu67, as does the ferroxidase-depleted variant. This seems to argue for the general importance of these residues in catalysing iron oxide deposition over that in bulk solution. The L-chains have, in addition to the conserved Glu61 ,Glu64,Glu67 residues, two additional carboxylate groups, Glu57,Glu60, (H-chain numbering) close to the cavity surface which might augment cation sequestration and nuclei formation in the absence of the ferroxidase centre. Depletion of the Glu61 ,Glu64,Glu67 residues, however, does not result in a functionally inactive protein. The rate of iron uptake in this variant is approximately 20% of that for rHF suggesting that the glutamate residues may play a role in the oxidation process at the ferroxidase centres. It is possible that in rHF the glutamate ligands are involved in moving Fe(II1) from the ferroxidase centre into the cavity. Whether the Glu61,Glu64,Glu67 residues act independently or co-operatively remains to be determined. However, some preliminary results appear to highlight Glu61 as being the key residue. For example, an invertebrate ferritin containing Glu61 and not Glu64,Glu67 has recently been cloned and overexpressed and found to rapidly take up iron (Hirzmann, Dietzel, Preis, Symmons, Kunz. Treffry & Harrison, unpublished results) and a recent human H-chain variant containing only one substitution, Glu61 -+ Ala, is similar to the variant Glu6l,Glu64,Glu67 + Ala in its rate of iron uptake (Levi & Arosio, unpublished results). Details of the core structure of these proteins as well as the effect of changing Glue1 along with the ferroxidase ligands are at present unknown. In conclusion, we have shown that residues close to or on the cavity surface of various types of ferritin are involved in oxidation or nucleationdriven processes that effectively compete with the bulk deposition of ferrihydrite. The protein only becomes functionally inactive when both processes are curtailed by a combination of site-directed modifications. The finding that many amino acid substitutions maintain the ability to deposit iron as ferrihydrite specifically within the cavity suggests that the size and architecture of the internal cavity, rather than the precise sequenceof residues, may be a dominant influence in iron core formation. In this regard it is notable not only that H-chain and L-chain ferritins are isomorphous (Lawson et al., 1991) but that the bacterioferritin of E. coli, which is able to deposit iron as ferrihydrite (Mann et al., 1987), has a generally similar size and molecular construction to that of ferritin although its amino

acid sequenceshows little similarity (Andrews et al., 1989). Thus the regulation of biomineralization in ferritin may be dependent primarily on the matching of electrostatic fields rather than structural correspondence at the mineral-protein interface. Indeed, no preferred orientation of the ferrihydrite cores with respect to the protein shell has been observed by X-ray diffraction in either ferritin (Fischbach et al., 1969) or a reconstituted bacterioferritin (Smith et al., 1991).
