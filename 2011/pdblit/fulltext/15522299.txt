Abstract The active center of the glycoside hydrolase family 32 contains the three characteristic motifs (N/S)DPNG, RDP, and EC. We replaced the N-terminal region including the (N/ S)DPNG motif of barley 6-SFT (sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase) by the corresponding region of Festuca 1-SST (sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase). The chimeric enzyme, expressed in Pichia, retained the specificity of 6-SFT. Attempts to replace a larger piece at the N-terminus including also the RDP motif failed. A point mutation introduced in the RDP motif of 1-SST abolished enzymatic activity. Interestingly, point mutations of the EC-motif resulted in an enzyme which had lost the capability to form 1-kestose and glucose from sucrose but still accepted 1-kestose, producing fructose and sucrose as well as nystose. ” 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Fructans are polymers of fructose used as storage carbohydrates by many plants. They are synthesized from sucrose by specific fructosyltransferases (FTs). The linkages between the fructosyl-residues are either exclusively of the b(2-1) or the b(2-6) type, or both linkage types occur in branched fructans [1]. The degree of polymerization and distribution of linkage types, depending on FT specificities, are characteristic of different plant species. Fructan synthesis in plants is initiated generally by a sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST) using sucrose both as fructosyl donor and acceptor to produce 1-kestose, the shortest b(2-1) linked fructan, and glucose. In the case of grasses such as wheat and barley, the next step of fructan synthesis is mediated by a sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT), which again uses sucrose as fructosyl donor but fructans, preferably 1-kestose, as acceptor, forming b(2-6) linkages. Thus, by fructosyl transfer to 1-kestose the smallest branched fructan, the tetrasaccharide bifurcose, is formed. It remains to be shown whether or not additional FTs are involved in fructan synthesis of grasses.

Many plant FTs have been sequenced during the last few years, and the data clearly indicate a high homology to the vacuolar, acid invertases (b-fructosidases). These enzymes are all members of the glycoside hydrolase family 32 (GH32) and share three highly conserved regions characterized by the motifs (N/S)DPNG (also called b-fructosidase motif), RDP, and EC [2]. A function in sucrose hydrolysis has been experimentally shown for the (N/S)DPNG- and EC-motifs in the case of yeast invertase, and for the RDP motif in the case of bacterial FTs belonging to the family GH68 [3≠5]. An invertase of the bacterium Thermotoga maritima was the first GH32 member of which the crystal structure has been determined [6], followed by structural analyses of an Aspergillus awamori exo-inulinase and of a chicory fructan-exohydrolase [7,8]. These structures show all a five bladed b-propellers with a deep negatively charged central pocket and a b-sandwich. The three highly conserved motifs mentioned above flank this central pocket. The aspartate of the (N/S)DPNG motif is proposed to act as a nucleophile, the glutamate of the EC-motif as a proton donor, and the aspartate of the RDP motif as transition state stabilizer in the transfructosylation reaction [2]. From the GH32 members structurally elucidated, chicory FEH is the closest relative of plant FTs and vacuolar invertases, with an amino acid sequence identity of 30≠40%. For plant FTs, no crystal structures are available yet, but the three conserved domains of chicory FEH flanking the central pocket, defined by the motifs (N/S)DPNG, RDP and EC, are highly conserved also in these FTs. Moreover, the (N/S)DPNG-motif has been shown by mutational studies to be essential for the activity of an onion FT [9]. For the RDP- and EC-motif of plant FT’s, such studies have not been made so far. Another common feature of plant FTs and vacuolar invertases is that they usually are composed of a large and a small subunit due to a posttranslational processing [10≠12], as indicated in Fig. 1A. In a previous study using barley 6-SFT [10] and Festuca 1-SST [13], we found that the large subunit, which harbours all three conserved motifs mentioned above, determines the catalytic specificity [14]. Our present work continues the comparative study of barley 6-SFT and Festuca 1-SST and provides the first experimental evidence that the motifs of all the three conserved motifs are of functional importance in the case of the two plant FT’s studied. We narrowed down the region of the proteins responsible for enzyme specificity by exchanging motifs including the (N/S)DPNG-motif between Festuca 1-SST and barley 6-SFT, and by introducing point mutations in the EC- and RDP-motif of Festuca 1-SST.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Construction of recombinant chimeric enzymes, mutagenesis and expression The Pichia shuttle plasmids pPICZaC-F2 and pPICZaC-P3 were described before [14]. They carry a Zeocin resistance gene and contain the following coding sequences, cloned in frame behind the a-factor signal sequence: pPICZaC-F2, mature Festuca 1-SST (from Festuca arundinacea, reclassified as Schedonorus arundinaceus; EMBL AJ297369 [13]; Fig. 1A); pPICZaC-P3, mature barley 6-SFT (from Hordeum vulgare; EMBL X83233 [10]; Fig. 1B). They were used for the construction of Chimera1 and Chimera2 (Fig. 1C and D). For Chimera1 (Fig. 1C), the N-terminal region of mature Festuca 1SST was coupled to the C-terminus of barley 6-SFT by overlapping PCR [15], using primer pair SST-002/RDP-002 to amplify from the EcoRI cloning site to bp 639 in 1-SST and SFT-002/RDP-001 to amplify 6-SFT from bp 523 to bp 1162. The PCR-amplified fragments were used as templates in a second PCR with primers SST-002 and SFT-002. The full-length product created in this way was cloned into pPICZaC-P3 using EcoRI and XmaJI resulting in pPICZaC-Chimera1. Chimera2 (Fig. 1D) was created correspondingly using primers SST002/EC-002 and SFT-002/EC-001 and primers SST-002 and SFT-002 in the second PCR, followed by EcoRI/XmaJI cloning resulting in pPICZaC-Chimera2. Mutant SST(D260A), in which the aspartate in the RDP motif of Festuca 1-SST was changed into alanine (Fig. 1E) , as well as the mutant SST(E318A) and SST(E318D), in which the glutamate of tje EC motif was changed into alanine or aspartate (Fig. 1F), respectively, were generated using the QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Strategene), based on the pK18-clone containing the tagged version of Festuca 1-SST as described [14]. Primers SST023.2 and SST024.2 (Table 1) were designed to introduce the desired mutation for SST(D260A), SST017 and SST018 for SST(E318A) and SST015 and SST016 for SST(E318D). SST(D260A), SST(E318A) and

SST(E318D) were cloned EcoRI/XbaI into the Pichia shuttle vector pPICZaC. All inserts in pPICZaC were sequenced after cloning and found to carry the desired mutation or the desired chimera. All constructs carry a C-terminal 6 ∑ histidine tag and are cloned behind the a-factor secretion signal. Transformation to Pichia, expression and further processing were described before [14]. 2.2. Characterization of recombinant fructosyltransferases Enzyme assays were performed at 27 ∞C with 100 mM sucrose (suc) or with 50 mM of all other substrates, and the products formed were analysed by anion exchange chromatography as described [16]. Catalytic specificity was tested with the following substrates: sucrose, 1-kestose, nystose and a combination of sucrose and 1-kestose. A maximum of 7% of the substrates was used up after the incubations. In order to keep the substrate concentration constant during the experiments, the amount of protein used per enzyme assay was ca 0.5 lg for Festuca 1SST and 5≠10 lg for all other constructs. Total protein concentrations in the samples were measured using Biorad protein assay reagent according to the manufacturer. For western blots, methanol≠chloroform precipitated enzyme preparations (5≠10 lg each) were separated on a 10% gel by SDS≠PAGE, electro blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH) and probed with monoclonal anti-His and alkaline-phosphatase secondary antibodies.

ping PCR using Festuca arundinacea 1-SST (Fig. 1A) and Hordeum vulgare 6-SFT (Fig. 1B). In Chimera1 (Fig. 1C), the N-terminal part encompassing the (N/S)DPNG motif is from 1-SST, whereas the C-terminal part encompassing the RDP motif and the EC-motif is from 6-SFT. In Chimera2 the N-terminal part encompassing the (N/S)DPNG- and RDP-motif is from 1-SST, whereas the C-terminal part encompassing the EC-motif is from 6-SFT (Fig. 1D). Point mutations were investigated using Festuca 1-SST (Fig. 1E and F). To verify proper expression of the constructs, western blots were performed using antibodies against the C-terminal His tag. Extracts of Pichia transformed with the empty vector pPICZaC did not show any bands on the blots (Fig. 2, lane P0). In contrast, clear bands were revealed on blots with extracts of Pichia transformed with the various constructs. Normally, Festuca 1-SST and barley 6-SFT isolated form plants consist of two subunits and show two bands on SDS-gels [10,13]. However, upon expression in Pichia, most constructs yielded primarily a band of approximately 85 kD. This indicates that the recombinant proteins are well expressed but not cleaved into two subunits, as was already previously demonstrated for recombinant untagged SST [13]. A faint band at 35 kD was apparent for some of the constructs, indicating release of a fragment possibly corresponding to the small subunit in Pichia (Fig. 2); since the antibodies are directed against the C-terminal tag, fragments corresponding to the large subunit cannot be seen on this western blot. For Chimera2, the

85 kD is even fainter than the 35 kD band, indicating that this product is weakly expressed or unstable in Pichia. 3.2. The (N/S)DPNG motif does not determine enzymatic specificity Chimera1 (Fig. 1C), with the NDPNG motif of 1-SST, was tested with different substrates and its activity was compared to the activities of recombinant 1-SST and 6-SFT, with the motif in the form of SDPNG (Fig. 3). In incubations with 100 mM sucrose it was mainly hydrolytically active, as can be seen by the predominant production of fructose (Fig. 3A). The other products formed by Chimera1 in incubations with sucrose were 1-kestose, 6-kestose and marginal amounts of bifurcose. The products formed and their relative amounts were the same as for recombinant 6-SFT. In corresponding incubations, recombinant 1-SST produces mainly 1-kestose (80%). Also in incubations with a combination of sucrose and 1-kestose, the products formed by Chimera1 were fructose, 6-kestose and bifurcose, and their relative amounts were the same as for recombinant 6-SFT (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the corresponding incubation with 1-SST lead to the production of fructose and nystose. These analyses of Chimera1 showed that it retained all the characteristics of recombinant 6-SFT. Its 1-SST derived N-terminal part, including the conserved b-fructosidase motif NDPNG, does not influence enzymatic properties. Preparations of Chimera2 (Fig. 1D) did not show any enzymatic activity. In addition, as shown above (Fig. 2), this chimera

In incubations with 100 mM sucrose, the total activity of the protein was approximately 125 nkat/mg protein for 1-SST, 0.75 nkat/ mg protein for 6-SFT and 0.7 nkat/mg protein for Chimera1. Data represent means and standard deviation (n = 5, corresponding to five different enzyme preparations from five separate induction experiments). The sum of products formed is set to 100%.

yielded only low amounts of protein, indicating that changing the exact sequence in the conserved region between the EC-motif and the RDP motif might reduce protein stability. 3.3. Amino acid substitutions in the RDP- and the EC-motif reveal their necessity for fructosyltransfer In order to investigate the functional importance of the aspartate D260 in the RDP motif of 1-SST, it was changed to alanine in the mutant SST(D260A) (Fig. 1E). The resulting protein displayed a strong band of 85 kD on western blots and was equally well expressed and as stable as non-mutated recombinant 1-SST (Fig. 2). However, it had no detectable enzymatic activity, indicating the importance of the acidic residue in the transfructosylation reaction. Typically, the main reaction catalyzed by 1-SST with sucrose as a substrate is the formation of 1-kestose and glucose, with a small amount of glucose and fructose formed in a side reaction (Fig. 4A and Fig. 5A). Like the mutant SST(D260A), the mutants SST(E318A) or SST(E318D), in which the glutamate of the EC motif was changed into alanine and aspartate, respectively, lost the ability to use sucrose as a fructosyl-donor and as an acceptor. After incubations of two days with 100 mM sucrose, neither breakdown of sucrose nor polymerization to fructan was observed (Fig. 4A). Western blotting showed that the enzymes were equally well expressed in Pichia pastoris as non-

mutated 1-SST (Fig. 2). When wild-type 1-SST was incubated with 1-kestose, it produced fructose, sucrose and nystose (Fig. 4B). In analogy to the catalytic activities with sucrose, this is due to a main reaction yielding sucrose and nystose and on a side reaction yielding sucrose and fructose (Fig. 5B). Mutant SST(D260A) was totally inactive when incubated with 1-kestose. Interestingly, however, the mutants SST(E318A) and SST(E318D) kept the ability to use 1-kestose (Fig. 4B), although their activity was heavily reduced (approximately 850-fold) compared to non-mutated 1-SST. Time dependent product formation was followed for two days for SST(E318A) and SST(E318D) incubated with 50 mM 1-kestose (data are shown only for SST(E318A)). They produced increasing amounts of fructose, sucrose and very little nystose in a time dependent manner (Fig 4B). The two mutants were inactive in incubations with nystose (data not shown). In summary, the mutations of the glutamate of the EC-motif abolished the use of sucrose, but retained the ability to use 1-kestose. Thus the EC-motif has an influence on substrate usage in 1-SST.

elucidation of the structure of some related enzymes. Crystal structures became available recently for members of the glycoside hydrolase families GH32 and GH68, i.e., enzymes that catalyze similar reactions although they share only 15% overall sequence identity. They all form five bladed b-propellers with a deep negatively charged central pocket representing the active site [6≠8,17]. Members of GH32 additionally have a b-sand-

wich attached to the propeller that possibly corresponds to the small subunit found in plant acid invertases and FTs. In the structure of Bacillus subtilis levansucrase (GH68), the central pocket contains three acidic amino acid residues essential for the catalytic mechanism: the nucleophile (D86), the general acid/base catalyst (E342) and the transition state stabilizer (D247) [17]. These catalytic residues are also present in the

4652

active site of all enzymes of family GH32 for which structures are available, and they correspond to the conserved motifs (N/S)DPNG, EC and RDP within GH32. In plant enzymes belonging to this family, i.e., the FTs and acid invertases, only the (N/S)DPNG (b-fructosidase) motif was biochemically characterized via domain-exchanges and point mutations. It was shown to be important for product specification but not for the specification of the type of fructosyl donor used; thus its influence on enzyme specificity seems to act via acceptor specification [9]. The mutation of the nucleophile itself (D85) resulted in an enzymatically inactive protein (Ritsema et al., submitted). In our present work, the results with Chimera1 gave further insight into the function of the b-fructosidase motif, which has the usual sequence NDPNG in 1-SST but the less frequent sequence SDPNG in 6-SFT. The chimeric enzyme retained all the characteristics of recombinant 6-SFT although its N-terminal part, including the canonical NDPNG motif, was derived from 1-SST. 1-SST and 6-SFT can both use sucrose as an acceptor and donor substrate, but they differ in their preferential fructosyl acceptor substrate. Chimera1 prefers the same fructosyl acceptor substrates like barley 6-SFT. Since 1-SST and 6-SFT have the same preferred fructosyl-donor (sucrose), exchanging the N-terminus containing the b-fructosidase motif might give no change in donor specificity. The C-terminal part of the chimera is influencing acceptor binding which is different for 1-SST and 6-SFT (sucrose or 1-kestose, respectively). The point mutation SST(D260A) of the RDP motif yielded an inactive product. The aspartate residue of this motif has been proposed to act as transition state stabilizer [4,5,17,18]. It forms strong hydrogen bonds with the substrate sucrose, but is too far away from either the C2 0 hydroxyl or the glycosidic oxygen of sucrose to be directly involved in the catalytic mechanism, i.e., in hydrolyzing the bond between glucose and fructose of sucrose [6,17]. Our mutation (D260A) introduces an Ala residue, which is unable to form hydrogen-bonds, and which may additionally represent a hindrance for interaction with the substrate because it is smaller than Asp. Furthermore a conformational change of SST(D260A) cannot be excluded. Various studies of GH68 enzymes have shown that the more conservative Asp to Asn mutation in the RDP motif also leads to an inactive enzyme, indicating, that the negative charge is required [4,5,18]. The acidic amino acids in the other two motifs have been found to be directly involved in catalysis. This was first described for yeast invertase, a member of the GH32 family: The aspartate in the (N/S)DPNG (b-fructosidase) motif (Asp23) was shown to be the catalytic nucleophile while the glutamate of the EC-motif (Glu204) was identified as the general acid/base catalyst [3]. Our results with the point mutation of the corresponding glutamate in 1-SST (SST(E318A); SST(E318D)) are particularly intriguing, since they indicate a resulting change in the enzyme’s catalytic activity. Both mutated forms completely lost the ability to use sucrose as a fructosyl donor and to form either 1-kestose and glucose (sucrose as acceptor) or fructose and glucose (water as acceptor) (Fig. 5A). This result is in accordance with the corresponding mutation of E204A in yeast invertase, which leads to a total loss of sucrose cleaving capacity [3]. However, yeast invertase has only one substrate (sucrose) whereas Festuca 1-SST can also use 1-kestose as a fructosyl donor. Wild type 1-SST produces fructose, sucrose and nystose (1-kestose as acceptor)

and sucrose and fructose (water as acceptor) when incubated with 1-kestose (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, the mutants SST(E318A) and SST(E318D) are still able to form these products from 1-kestose, although with markedly reduced efficiency. Why is this possible? The 3D-structure of the active site of Bacillus subtilis levansucrase in the presence of sucrose shows that the glutamate of the EC-motif points towards the bond between the glucose and the fructose moiety of sucrose [17]. The fructosyl unit of sucrose is located at the bottom of the pocket and the glucose moiety on top. Since 1-kestose has two fructose moieties attached to glucose, its terminal fructosyl residue probably can contact another acid/base catalyst in the active site, most likely another glutamyl or aspartyl residue close by. In an attempt to explore this possibility, we analysed the surroundings of the active site of chicory FEH, the closest relative of our Festuca 1-SST (approximately 40% sequence identity) among the crystallized fructosyl hydrolases/transferases (atomic coordinates and structure factor files of chicory FEH have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1ST8; Verhaest et al., 2005). FEH has one glutamyl and four apartyl residues in close proximity of the active-site EC motif. These are D204, D217, E234, D237 and D281 (note that Verhaest and coworkers count from the strart of their mature recombinant protein). Alignment of Festuca 1-SST with chicory FEH indicates conservation of these acidic residues, represented by D321, E331, D350, D355 and D397 in its primary sequence. We suggest that one of these residues may act as alternative acid/base catalyst in the reaction of the mutant enzymes SST(E318A) and SST(E318D) with 1-kestose as a substrate. The general glycosyl hydrolase reaction mechanism in members of the GH32 and GH68 families is based on three acidic amino acid residues in the active center. Neither the available crystal structures nor the data obtained with mutational analysis can unequivocally answer the question what structural components determine enzyme specificity. Functional differences such as N-glycosylation or amino acid changes outside active site residues may play a role in the selection of different substrates [8] and will be investigated in the future.
