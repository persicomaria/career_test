Abstract We previously reported that the hemes of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase (ARP) undergo vinyl and meso-carbon modifications when the enzymes oxidize chloride ion. Here we demonstrate for ARP that, although both modifications exhibit the same pH profile with an optimum at $pH 4.0, monochlorodimedone suppresses the vinyl but not meso-carbon modifications. Furthermore, meso-chlorination occurs when ARP reacts with exogenous HOCl, implicating an Fe(III)­O­Cl intermediate in the reaction. These results establish that (a) the chloro species involved in meso-modification differs from that which reacts with the vinyl groups, (b) equilibration of the vinyl modifying species (HOCl) into the medium occurs more rapidly than vinyl group modification, and (c) the oxidation of chloride by ARP produces two reactive species: HOCl, which adds to the heme vinyl but not meso-positions, and a distinct second species that adds to the meso-carbon.

Hemoprotein peroxidases catalyze two types of reactions. The most general reaction is one electron abstraction from electron rich substrates to produce substrate-derived radicals. A typical example is the conversion of phenols to phenoxy radicals [1,2]. The second type of reaction is the net two-electron oxidation of heteroatoms to give the corresponding oxides. An example of this is the conversion of ClÀ to HOCl by myeloperoxidase [3,4], a reaction that until recently was thought to be too energetically unfavorable to be catalyzed by plant peroxidases. This is consistent with the fact that the oxidation of halides by the mammalian peroxidases is physiologically important for the destruction of pathogenic microorganisms [5], but the oxidation of halides by plant peroxidases has no general physiological role. The catalytic mechanism of all peroxidases involves reaction of the enzyme with a peroxide to generate an Fe(IV)@O species coupled to either a porphyrin or protein radical that is known as Compound I [5,6].

atic cycle, Compound I is reduced by two one-electron steps, first to Compound II in which the protein or porphyrin radical is quenched, and subsequently to the resting ferric state. In contrast, the oxidation of halide ions is thought to involve addition of the halide (XÀ) to the ferryl of Compound I to generate a transient Fe(III)­OX species from which HOX dissociates as a diffusible hypohalide [7]. HOX is an antimicrobial agent involved in host defense [7,8]. It has been postulated that, in addition to the dissociated HOX, the Fe(III)­OX intermediate may also function as an oxidative agent, but the role of this second oxidizing species, if any, remains uncertain [7,9­12]. Recently we reported that horseradish peroxidase (HRP), Arthromyces ramosus peroxidase (ARP), and soybean peroxidase oxidize chloride ion, albeit only at acidic pH and to a lower extent than a mammalian peroxidase like myeloperoxidase [13,14]. Based on the initial rate of chloride oxidation, lactoperoxidase is nearly 20-fold more active than HRP and 2-fold more active than ARP, and myeloperoxidase in turn is much more active than lactoperoxidase [15]. Interestingly, the prosthetic heme group in the plant and fungal, but not mammalian, peroxidases was

L. Huang, P.R. Ortiz de Montellano / Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 355 (2007) 581­586 pH dependence of the heme vinyl- and meso-modifications. ARP (60 lM, 10 lL) and KCl (4 M, 20 lL) were added to 60 lL of citrate/phosphate buffer (0.5 M) at pH 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0, respectively. To each of these solutions was added H2O2 (2.4 mM, 10 lL). The total reaction volume was 100 lL, and the final concentrations were: ARP, 6 lM; ClÀ, 0.80 M; H2O2, 0.24 mM. After incubation at $25 °C for 15 min, a 70 lL aliquot of the solution was directly injected into the HPLC. The modified and unmodified heme peaks were integrated and the peak areas were plotted against the pH values with KaleidaGraph 3.5. Reaction of ARP with exogenous hypochlorite. To ARP (100 lM, 10 lL) in 60 lL of citrate buffer (0.5 M, pH 4.4) was added NaOCl (3.2 mM, 10 lL · 3) at 10 min intervals. An experiment with free hemin instead of ARP was performed as a control: hemin (0.6 mM in tetrahydrofuran, 10 lL) and NaOCl (16 mM, 10 lL) were added to 80 lL citrate buffer (0.5 M, pH 4.4). After 30 min, the solutions were injected into the HPLC for heme product analysis.

modified at the vinyl- and meso-positions during chloride oxidation [14]. Comparison of HRP and ARP revealed that ARP is much more susceptible to meso-chlorination than HRP [13]. We have investigated the meso-modification of ARP to clarify the nature of the reaction and to explore the features of ARP that favor it. Our results indicate that (a) HOCl equilibrates into the medium prior to vinyl group modification, (b) a different oxidizing species is responsible for meso-chlorination than vinyl modification, and (c) the second oxidizing species, like HOCl, probably derives from a common Fe(III)­O­Cl intermediate. Material and methods
Materials. ARP, 30% (w/w) H2O2, monochlorodimedone (MCD), trifluoroacetic acid, NaOCl, and hemin were from Sigma­Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). d4-Mesoheme was provided by Grzegorz Wojciechoswki [16]. Citrate buffer was prepared by titrating citric acid to pH 4.4 with 1 M KOH. Phosphate buffer (25 mM) was prepared by titrating dibasic potassium phosphate to pH 7.0 with 0.1 M KOH. Water was double glass distilled prior to use. Spectrophotometric measurements were performed on a HewlettPackard 8450A diode array spectrophotometer. The concentrations of HRP and ARP were determined using the molar extinction coefficients e403 = 102,000 MÀ1 cmÀ1 [17] and e403 = 108,000 MÀ1 cmÀ1 [18], respectively. The H2O2 concentration was standardized spectrophotometrically at 240 nm (e = 43.6 MÀ1 cmÀ1) [19]. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was performed on a Waters Micromass ZQ coupled to a Waters Alliance HPLC system (2695 separations module, Waters 2487 Dual k Absorbance detector) employing an XterraÒ MS C18 column (2.1 · 50 mm, 3.5 lm). HPLC was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1090 Series II instrument equipped with a photodiode array detector. Unless otherwise specified, analyses were performed on a Vydac protein C4 column (4.6 · 150 mm, 5 lm) fitted with a precolumn filter (MAC-MOD, Chadds Ford, PA). Solvent A was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The gradient program consisted of linear segments with 30% B (0­3 min), from 30% to 40% B (3­23 min), 95% B (23.1­26 min), and 30% B (26.1­30 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The eluent was monitored at 278 and 400 nm. Reaction of d4-mesoheme-reconstituted ARP with chloride. ARP (10 mg) dissolved in 1 mL of water was acidified with 10 lL of 6 N HCl. The solution was extracted with 2-butanone (2 mL · 2) and the aqueous phase, after passing through a PD-10 column and concentration on an AmiconÒ ultra centrifugal filter device (MWCO 10 K), afforded apoARP (0.23 mM, 1.1% residual heme). An aliquot of the apoARP solution (50 lL) was added to 300 lL of phosphate buffer (25 mM, pH 7.0), followed by addition of 1.2 equivalents of d4-mesoheme (0.4 mM, 3.4 lL). After incubation for 2 h at $25 °C, the solution was changed to citrate buffer (50 mM, pH 4.4) on an AmiconÒ ultra centrifugal filter device (MWCO 10 K). The final volume was 80 lL. A 20 lL aliquot of the reconstituted ARP (final concentration 0.4 lM) was mixed with KCl (final concentration 0.6 M) in 30 mM citrate buffer and H2O2 (final concentration 0.2 mM) was then added to initiate the reaction. After 20 min, the reaction mixture was analyzed by LC/MS. Effect of MCD on heme modification. Native ARP (60 lM, 10 lL) and KCl (4 M, 20 lL) were added to 20 lL of citrate buffer (0.5 M, pH 4.0). To this mixture was added MCD (1 mM) 0, 40, and 60 lL, respectively, followed by addition of citrate buffer to bring the volume to 110 lL. Each solution was then mixed with H2O2 (2.4 mM, 10 lL) to initiate the reaction. The final concentrations were: ARP, 5 lM; ClÀ, 0.67 M; MCD, 0, 0.33, or 0.50 mM; H2O2, 0.20 mM. After 20 min at $25 °C, the solutions (84 lL) were injected into the HPLC.

Results Reaction of d4-mesoheme-reconstituted ARP with chloride We previously demonstrated that a single chloride was autocatalytically added to a meso-carbon of the prosthetic group when mesoheme-reconstituted ARP oxidized chloride ion [13]. This suggested that the chlorination occurred at a meso-carbon because in mesoheme the vinyl groups are replaced by ethyls, but it did not unambiguously establish the site of the reaction. We therefore reconstituted ARP with d4-mesoheme in which a deuterium replaces each of the four meso-hydrogen atoms. Reaction of the reconstituted ARP with chloride and H2O2 at pH 4.4 gave a modified heme with a molecular ion at m/z 657 [624 (d4-mesoheme) À 2 (deuterium) + 35 (Cl)] (Fig. 1), which corresponds to replacement of one meso-deuterium by a chlorine atom. The mass spectrum also exhibits the commonly observed (M + 32) peak that results from coordina100

tion of the solvent methanol to the iron atom. Clearly, the chloride is introduced at one of the four meso-carbons. Chloride oxidation by native ARP in the presence of MCD MCD, an enolized b-diketo cyclic compound, reacts with HOCl or HOBr to generate a non-enolizable tetrasubstituted carbon. The loss of absorbance associated with conversion of the enolized keto structure to an unconjugated diketone can be monitored spectroscopically. In sufficiently large amounts, MCD can effectively compete for HOCl or HOBr and thereby inhibit or suppress alternative reactions of these agents. We previously reported that MCD protected the prosthetic heme vinyl groups from modification during the oxidation of bromide by HRP [14]. To determine whether MCD similarly protects the heme of ARP during chloride oxidation, we incubated native ARP with H2O2 and chloride ion in the presence of excess MCD. Strikingly, only the vinyl modification was suppressed, leaving the mesochlorination unchanged (Fig. 2). With 2.5 equiv. of MCD (relative to H2O2), the vinyl addition was negligible,

whereas meso-chlorination proceeded unimpeded. This is clearly shown by the HPLC trace, in which the peak at 10 min due to heme with both vinyl- and meso-modifications is suppressed in the presence of MCD, whereas the peak at $19 min of the singly modified meso-chloroheme is unaffected by MCD (Fig. 2, lower panel). As the MCD to H2O2 ratio is increased (Fig. 2, upper panel), the peak with the vinyl- and meso-modifications progressively decreases to essentially zero, that of meso-chloroheme remains unchanged, and that of unreacted heme increases.

Reaction of ARP with exogenous sodium hypochlorite To determine if exogenously added HOCl modifies the heme of ARP, the native enzyme was incubated with NaOCl at pH 4.4. The meso-chlorinated heme was formed in the incubation. The ratio of meso- to vinyl-modification of the heme was 10­15:1, in contrast to a ratio of $1­3:1 in incubations of ARP with H2O2 and ClÀ. Decreased vinyl modification was thus observed with exogenous HOCl. Incubation of hemin with NaOCl in aqueous medium at pH 4.4 yielded traces of modified hemes but no detectable trace of the meso-chloro addition.

pH dependence of the vinyl- and meso-modifications Incubations of ARP with H2O2 and chloride performed at pH 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 indicate that the pH profiles of the two heme modification reactions are similar (Fig. 3). At pH > 5, both modifications decrease dramatically, such that at neutral pH no modification is detected. At pH < 3.5, the signals from not only the two products but also unmodified heme decrease greatly, presumably due to degradation or precipitation of the hemes. The opti1000

mal pH for both modification reactions is approximately pH 4.0. Discussion As previously reported [13,14], the prosthetic hemes of HRP and ARP undergo vinyl and meso-modifications when the enzymes oxidize chloride ion. Although the heme modification patterns differ, they are qualitatively similar and involve addition of HOCl to one (or both) of the vinyl groups to give a chlorohydrin and/or replacement of a meso-hydrogen by a chloride atom. The differences in the modification patterns presumably reflect differences in the partitioning of Compound I into different reactive species, and/or topological or physical differences in the enzyme active sites. The key finding here is that, although MCD completely protects the heme of ARP from vinyl-modification during chloride oxidation, it has a negligible protective effect on meso-chlorination. As MCD is unlikely to penetrate far into the active site because the distal heme site in plant and fungal peroxidases is sterically constricted [20­22], HOCl must equilibrate into the medium, where it is trapped by MCD, at a faster rate than it reacts with the heme vinyl groups. Given the demonstration with d4-mesoheme-reconstituted ARP that meso-chlorination occurs, and the fact that meso-substitution reactions invariably occur at the d-meso-carbon in plant and fungal peroxidases

[23], the d-meso-carbon must be the site of chloride addition in ARP. The preferential reactivity of the d-meso-carbon is consistent with the crystal structures of HRP and ARP, which show that it is the most accessible meso-carbon [24­26]. Furthermore, the d-meso-carbon is less sterically protected and is more accessible to exogenous agents than either of the two heme vinyl groups. The species responsible for meso-halogenation thus must differ from that responsible for vinyl-modification, as steric effects cannot explain the differential reactivities of the two sites. The product profiles, our earlier studies with 18 O-labeled H2O2 and H2O, and the protection afforded by MCD unambiguously implicate HOCl (or more generally HOX) [14] as the agent that reacts with the vinyl groups. Therefore, by exclusion, HOCl itself cannot be directly responsible for meso-chlorination. What is the second oxidizing agent responsible for mesochlorination? One possibility is that homolytic scission of the O­Cl bond in the Fe(III)­O­Cl intermediate produces the Fe(IV)@O compound II intermediate and a chloride radical (Fig. 4). Addition of the Cl to the meso-carbon of Compound II would produce a transient isoporphyrin intermediate with a tetravalent meso-carbon. Electron transfer to the Fe(IV)@O would then reduce the iron to the ferric state and generate a cation that rearomatizes by loss of the meso-proton. An alternative possibility is that the Fe(III)­O­Cl intermediate directly delivers the chloro atom to the meso-carbon, although models suggest that

the meso-carbon is too far for this direct transfer unless there is significant ruffling of the porphyrin skeleton and/ or tilting of the Fe(III)­O­Cl bond towards the mesocarbon. The Fe(III)­O­Cl intermediate appears, nevertheless, to be the precursor of both the HOCl responsible for vinyl modifications and the agent involved in meso-chlorination, as both reactions were observed when NaOCl was added to ARP. The ratio of meso- to vinyl-modified hemes differed in the reaction with H2O2 and ClÀ from that with added NaOCl, the ratio being $1­3:1 in the former and $10­ 15:1 in the latter. This difference may stem from the slower generation of HOCl in the catalytic process. Interestingly, meso-chlorination was not observed when free heme was incubated with NaOCl, which implies that the reaction requires the structural organization or catalytic groups of the enzyme active site. These results support the conclusion that Fe(III)­O­Cl is the common precursor of both chlorinating species, a proposal consistent with the finding that both heme modification reactions exhibit similar pH profiles (Fig. 3). The reason for the higher susceptibility of ARP to mesochlorination--i.e., to formation of the second chlorinating species--is unclear. HOCl may dissociate less readily from the Fe(III)­OCl intermediate in ARP than in HRP due to active site differences, thus permitting a relatively slow homolytic scission of the O­Cl bond to compete more effectively with HOCl release. Visual comparison of the HRP [24] and ARP [25,26] crystal structure active sites shows that ARP has a larger and less polar site than HRP, and its two distal cavity waters are farther from the iron [27]. These differences could decrease the rate of dissociation of HOCl from the iron atom. ARP also has a higher reduction potential than HRP: the E00 values of ARP Compounds I and II are 0.915 and 0.982 V, respectively, while the corresponding values for HRP are 0.880, and 0.900 V [28]. One reason for this is the fact that the proximal histidine is deprotonated to a greater extent in HRP than in ARP, and the increased imidazolate character stabilizes the hypervalent Compound I more than a neutral imidazole. The higher potential of the ARP Compound I and II intermediates could also favor homolytic scission of the Fe(III)­O­Cl. Thus, both slower dissociation of HOCl from the heme iron and an enhanced rate of O­Cl homolysis may contribute to higher meso-chlorination in ARP. The arguments above are based on the assumption that a chloride radical is the meso-chlorinating agent. Analysis of the reactions of electrophiles versus radicals with the meso-carbon of HRP have led to the conclusion that the meso-position reacts with radicals but not with electrophilic agents [29], and among radicals only with those having a bond dissociation energy greater than DH298 = 90 kcal/ mol. This includes the chloride radical (103.15 ± 0.03 kcal/mol) but not the bromide radical (87.54 ± 0.05) [30]. Interestingly, no meso-bromination is observed in the reactions of HRP and ARP with bromide ion even

though the heme of both enzymes is extensively modified on the vinyl groups by HOBr [14]. Despite the strong support of these results for a chloride radical mechanism, we cannot exclude a concerted or quasi-concerted/homolytic mechanism in which the chloride is delivered to the mesocarbon directly from the Fe(III)­O­Cl intermediate. A homolytic scission followed by directed transfer to the meso-carbon has been postulated in a computational analysis for the meso-hydroxylation of the heme catalyzed by heme oxygenases [31].
