Abstract b-Ketoacyl-ACP reductase catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of b-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein to generate b-hydroxyacylacyl carrier protein and NADP+, the second step of the fatty acid elongation system type II of bacteria, plants, and apicomplexan organisms. Here, a modified and more efficient purification protocol is reported for recombinant Mycobacterium tuberculosis b-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (MabA). The increase in a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect values measured at pH 10 as compared to those obtained at pH 7 points to isotope- and pH-sensitive steps occurring concomitantly. Equilibrium and kinetic fluorescence studies demonstrate positive cooperativity in binding of NADPH to MabA, with two forms of free enzyme in solution. Equilibrium dialysis shows no cooperativity in acetoacetyl-CoA binding to the enzyme. Moreover, modest affinity loss occurs when the substrates bind to the monomer as compared to the dimer of MabA. A mechanism of substrate binding to MabA is proposed on the basis of the experimental data. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fatty acid elongation occurs through repetitive cycles of condensation, b-keto reduction, dehydration, and enoyl reduction which are catalyzed by, respectively, b-ketoacyl synthase, b-ketoacyl reductase, b-hydroxyacyl dehydrase, and enoyl reductase [1]. These chemical reactions are catalyzed by two types of fatty acid synthase systems (FAS)1. The FAS-I system is a multidomain polyprotein that

encodes all the enzymes necessary for fatty acid synthesis in one large polypeptide and is generally present in most eukaryotes, except in plants. FAS-II systems, which are present in bacteria and plants, catalyze the individual reactions by separate proteins readily purified independently of the other enzymes of the pathway and are encoded by unique genes. Mycobacteria, unlike most organisms, have both FAS-I and FAS-II systems. The mycobacterial FAS-I system catalyzes not only the synthesis of C16 and C18 fatty acids, the normal products of de novo synthesis, but also elongation to produce C24 and C26 fatty acids [1­3]. The mycobacterial FAS-II elongates C16 and C18 FAS-II precursors to fatty acids ranging from 24 to 56 carbons in length. The growing acyl chain is attached to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) for the chemical reactions catalyzed by the enzymes of the FAS-II system [1,3­5]. The FAS-I and FAS-II systems provide precursors for

the biosynthesis of mycolic acids, which are high-molecular-weight a-alkyl, b-hydroxy fatty acids, that are essential components of the mycobacterial cell wall [1­3]. The second step of the elongation cycle is the NADPH-dependent reduction of b-ketoacyl-ACP (Fig. 1), catalyzed by the mabA-encoded b-ketoacylACP reductase (MabA) [6]. The enzyme belongs to the family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) [7], displaying strong preference for NADPH over NADH, stronger specificity for long b-ketoacyl chains, and a dimer­tetramer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of 22 lM [8]. It has recently been demonstrated that MabA is essential for M. tuberculosis survival [9]. MabA represents thus an attractive target for drug development against M. tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB). TB is a major human health threat, with an annual rate of 8.8 million new cases, and 1.7 million deaths, 95% of which occurring in developing countries [10]. In addition, there is an increasing incidence of infection with multidrug-resistant strains (MDR-TB), defined as being resistant to at least two drugs commonly used to treat TB, isoniazid and rifampicin [11]. More recently, it was reported cases of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDRTB), defined as cases in persons with TB whose isolates are resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin (MDR-TB) as well as to any of the fluoroquinolone drugs and to at least one of three injectable second-line drugs capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin [12]. XDR-TB has a wide geographic distribution [13] and an unprecedented fatality rate [14]. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of new antimycobacterial agents. We have recently reported results indicating that MabA acts through a steady-state random Bi­Bi kinetic mechanism, and transfers hydride and proton in the same, partially rate-limiting step [15]. In the present work, a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effect analysis was employed to provide further knowledge on the chemical mechanism of MabA-catalyzed reaction, allowing conclusions in agreement with those previously reported [15]. Furthermore, binding studies were carried out to characterize the interaction of MabA with NADPH and acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAcCoA). The results indicate positive cooperativity in NADPH binding, with two forms of free enzyme present in solution, and a reduced affinity of both substrates for the monomeric form of MabA as compared to the affinity for the dimer. The results presented here provide evidence for the mode of action of the enzyme and are expected to be useful in the development of new inhibitors of MabA activity.

Materials and methods Materials
All chemicals were of analytical or reagent grade and were used without further purification unless stated otherwise. NADPH, NADP+, AcAcCoA, 2-propanol-2-d (98 atom % D), and Thermoanaerobium brockii alcohol dehydrogenase were from Sigma.

Enzyme purification
The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as previously described [15]. Since there have been improvements to the purification protocol previously described for recombinant MabA [15], here we give a brief description of this optimized protocol. Cells were resuspended in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0 (buffer A), incubated with 0.2 mg mLÀ1 lysozyme, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 48,000g for 60 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was loaded on an FPLC HT-Blue column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A, and the adsorbed material was eluted with a linear gradient (0­100%) of 20 column volumes of 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0 containing 2 M NaCl (buffer B). The fractions containing MabA were pooled, concentrated using an Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (MWCO 10,000 Da), and loaded on a Sephacryl S-200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A, and the fractions containing MabA were pooled and loaded on a Mono-S cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A, and the adsorbed material was eluted with a linear gradient (0­25%) of 20 column volumes of buffer B. MabA-containing fractions were pooled and stored at À20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford et al. [16], using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as standard. N-Terminal sequencing was performed to confirm the identity of the enzyme.

Enzymatic assay for MabA
All assays were performed under initial rate conditions at 25 °C and 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, unless stated otherwise. The oxidation of NADPH, in the presence of AcAcCoA and MabA, was monitored spectrophotometrically at either 340 nm (e = 6220 MÀ1 cmÀ1) or 370 nm (e = 2320 MÀ1 cmÀ1).

Synthesis of [4R-2H]NADPH
[4R-2H]NADPH was synthesized according to the method of Ottolina et al. [17], and purified on a Mono-Q anion exchange column (GE Healthcare) as previously described [18]. The fractions with A260 nm/ A340 nm 6 2.3 were pooled.

a-Secondary kinetic isotope effects
For isotope effect experiments, NADPH was further purified on a Mono-Q column. a-Secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects were determined by measuring initial rates in the presence of varying concentrations of one substrate and a fixed, saturating concentration of the other, using either [4R-4-1H]- or [4R-4-2H]-NADPH, in pH 7.0 and pH 10.0. In the experiment run in pH 10.0, the buffer was 100 mM CHES. Since small differences in rate are expected for a-secondary kinetic isotope effects,

The notation utilized to express isotope effects is that of Northrop [19] as extended by Cook and Cleland [20].

Fluorescence spectroscopy
Fluorescence titration of NADPH was carried out at 25 °C by making microliter additions of 10 mM NADPH (4.99­74.43 lM final concentration) to 2 mL of 4 lM MabA in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, keeping the dilution to a maximum of 0.75 %. At this concentration, MabA behaves as a homodimer in solution [8]. Excitation and emission wavelengths were, respectively, 360 and 460 nm. The slits for excitation and emission were, respectively, 1.5 and 5 nm. Control measurements were performed in the same conditions, except that no enzyme was added, and these values were subtracted from those obtained in the presence of the enzyme. This control was also employed to determine the maximum NADPH concentration to be utilized with no significant inner filter effect.

selected using a WG420 Scott filter positioned between the photomultiplier and the sample cell. The fluorescence change was followed to 100 ms, and 750 points were collected for each individual curve. An apparent rate constant and an amplitude change were obtained for each NADPH concentration upon curve fitting to a single exponential increase equation. To avoid inner filter effect, the NADPH concentration range utilized in this experiment was the same as previously determined in control experiments in the equilibrium fluorescence titration.

Data analysis
Values of kinetic and binding parameters and their standard errors were obtained by fitting the average data of duplicate experiments to the appropriate equations by using the nonlinear regression function of SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS, Inc.). Initial rate data at a single concentration of the fixed substrate were fitted to Eq. (1). m ¼ VA=ðK þ AÞ ð1Þ

Equilibrium dialysis
Equilibrium dialysis was performed utilizing a glass vial and a permeable membrane (MWCO 12,000­14,000 Da), according to the procedure of Klotz [21]. This membrane was not permeable to MabA (10 lM) whereas AcAcCoA could be freely exchanged with external buffer. To a volume of 5 mL of 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0 (including the volume of the dialysis bag containing MabA), 10 lL aliquots of 107 mM AcAcCoA solution, determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm (e = 15,400 MÀ1 cmÀ1) [22], were added, and, after letting the system reach equilibrium, 10 lL were withdrawn, and free AcAcCoA concentration was determined accordingly. It allowed the calculation of the extent of AcAcCoA binding to the enzyme dimer. This procedure was repeated until active site saturation was achieved. Control experiments were performed under the same conditions, except enzyme was not present in the dialysis bag. The results of the latter were utilized to calculate the amount of AcAcCoA adsorbed to either the membrane or the glass, which should be subtracted when calculating the extent of binding to the enzyme.

Isotope effect data were fitted to Eqs. (2) or (3), which assumes isotope effects on both V/K and V, and on V/K only, respectively. In Eqs. (1)­(3), V is the maximal velocity, A is the concentration of the varied substrate, K is the Michaelis constant for substrate A, EV/K and EV are the isotope effects À1 on V/K and V, respectively, and Fi is the fraction of deuterium label in the substrate. m ¼ VA=½Kð1 þ F i EV =K Þ þ Að1 þ F i EV Þ m ¼ VA=½Kð1 þ F i EV =K Þ þ A ð2Þ ð3Þ

Data from equilibrium fluorescence spectroscopy were fitted to Eq. (4), the Hill equation [23], in which F is the observed fluorescence signal, Fmax is the maximal fluorescence, n represents the total number of binding sites, and K 0 is a constant that gives half the maximal response, comprising the intrinsic dissociation constant. The equilibrium fluorescence data representing the fractional saturation (0.10­0.90) for the dimeric form of MabA were fitted to Eq. (5) (the Hill plot), where Y is the fraction of substrate binding sites occupied by the substrate, and h is the Hill coefficient. F ¼ F max An =ðK 0 þ An Þ log½Y =ð1 À Y Þ ¼ h log A À log K 0 ð4Þ ð5Þ

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements
Interaction of either NADPH or AcAcCoA to the MabA monomer was studied by surface plasmon resonance titration of the enzyme using a BIA-Core X equipment. A solution of 80 lg mLÀ1 MabA in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 6.0 was injected in a carboxymethyl-dextran coated gold surface (CM-5 Chip), previously activated with N-ethyl-N 0 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The possible remaining reactive sites on the surface were then blocked with ethanolamine. A reference cell was prepared in the same way except no MabA was injected. The initial response units (RU) of the immobilized protein was approximately 10,000, which dropped to a stabilized line at 5,000 RU after 4 h under a flow rate of 30 lL minÀ1, probably due to the removal of the non-covalently attached subunit of each dimer from the surface, indicating that the immobilized enzyme was in its monomeric form. Several concentrations of either AcAcCoA or NADPH were injected at a flow rate of 30 lL minÀ1, and the response was measured for each concentration. The value of the blank (100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0) was subtracted from all values obtained with each substrate.

SPR titration data and equilibrium dialysis were fitted to Eq. (6), where B is the binding signal (response units or extent of binding), Bmax is its maximal value, and KD is the overall dissociation constant derived from a substrate-dependent hyperbolic increase in response. B ¼ Bmax A=ðK D þ AÞ ð6Þ

The observable stopped-flow signal amplitudes were corrected using Eq. (7) [24] to account for any changes in fluorescence occurring in the dead time of the equipment. This correction of signal amplitude allows the obtainment of the total amplitude of the signal. In Eq. (7), DAmpobs is the observable signal amplitude, DAmp is the corrected amplitude change, td is the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument (1.37 ms), and kobs is the observed apparent association rate constant. The corrected signal amplitudes were fitted to Eq. (4) (Hill equation), in which DAmp replaces F and the maximum value for DAmp replaces Fmax. ln DAmp ¼ k obs td þ ln DAmpobs ð7Þ

Pre-steady-state kinetics of NADPH binding
The rate of formation of MabA­NADPH binary complex was determined by monitoring the rate of enhancement of nucleotide fluorescence upon NADPH binding to 4 lM MabA at 25 °C in 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, using an SX-18MV-R stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter (Applied Photophysics) in fluorescence mode (dead time 6 1.37 ms). Excitation wavelength was 360 nm with a slit width of 0.32 mm (corresponding to a spectral band width of 1.5 nm), and fluorescence signal above 420 nm was

The MabA­NADPH binary complex formation measured in the stopped-flow was characterized by a monophasic enhancement in nucleotide fluorescence. Accordingly, the data were fitted to a single exponential function, yielding values for observed apparent association rate constants (kobs). The kobs values were fitted as a function of varied substrate (A) to an equation describing a hyperbolic decay Eq. (8), in which Kd is the intrinsic dissociation constant, and k2 and kÀ2 are, respectively, limiting forward and reverse first-order rate constants for an isomerization process between two forms of free enzyme that must occur before substrate binding. k obs ¼ ½k 2 K d =ðA þ K d Þ þ k À2 ð8Þ

Results and discussion Purification of MabA In an attempt to increase the recovery of homogeneous MabA, the protocol given here is substantially different from the one we previously described [15]. The improved protocol permitted the enzyme to be successfully purified to homogeneity by a three-chromatographic steps protocol, as indicated by a single band on SDS­PAGE having the expected molecular weight (data not shown). A total of 7 mg of recombinant MabA protein was obtained from 2.5 g of cell paste, representing a 25% increase in the amount of recovered protein, with the same specific activity as compared to protein obtained using the previously described protocol [15]. N-Terminal sequencing confirmed not only the identity of the enzyme as MabA, but also the removal of the first methionine. a-Secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects In order to investigate the rate-limiting nature of the sp3 to sp2 re-hybridization that occur in the C-4 carbon of the nicotinamide ring of NADPH as the reaction proceeds, the a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects were determined for NADPH (Fig. 2A) and AcAcCoA (Fig. 2A, inset) at pH 7.0, at which the enzyme displays its maximal activity, and the results are summarized in Table 1. No a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects on the maximal velocity were observed for both substrates. Secondary kinetic isotope effects reflect altered bending vibrations at the substituted position as the reaction progresses from reactants to products through the transition state. Since the equilibrium isotope effect reflects changes in bending vibrations between reactants and products, the maximum value for the secondary kinetic isotope effect is the secondary equilibrium isotope effect [25,26]. Accordingly, values for normal a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects are expected to range from 1.0 to the a-secondary deuterium equilibrium isotope effect (a-DKeq), which is 1.13 for [4-2H]-NADPH reduction reactions [27]. The absence of a-D V and the small values observed for V/K (1.02 for NADPH, 1.08 for AcAcCoA) suggest that the hybridization change of the C-4 contributes modestly to the rate determining step of the MabA-catalyzed reaction. The normal values found for MabA also indicate the non-breaking bond between C-4 and the pro-R hydrogen occupies a relatively looser bonding environment in the transition state than it does in the ground state [29,30]. In an attempt to observe a more pronounced expression of the a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects, data were collected at pH 10.0 for NADPH (Fig. 2B) and AcAcCoA (Fig. 2B, inset), where the MabA-catalyzed reaction occurs at a considerably reduced rate owing to a slowed critical proton transfer [15]. The values for a-DV/K and a-D V (Table 1) increased to the same value (1.13) within standard error for both substrates, suggesting that both

isotope- and pH-sensitive steps are the same [31]. This points to both proton transfer and geometry change from tetrahedral (sp3) to planar (sp2) occurring at the C-4 of the nicotinamide ring taking place in the same transition state. The increase in a-DV/K values at pH 10 also indicates the existence of significant external commitment factors2 in the reaction catalyzed by MabA at neutral pH [31].
2 The commitment factor for a substrate is defined as the ratio of the rate constant for the isotope-sensitive step to the net rate constant of dissociation of this substrate from the complex capable of proceeding forward in the reaction path through a step that contains the isotopesensitive one. In direct comparison experiments, the commitments always refer to the varied substrate, independently on which substrate harbors the isotopic label. A commitment is composed of both internal and external portions. The internal portion is kept unchanged when the dissociation rate constant for the varied substrate is brought to infinite. The external portion includes the partition ratio with the dissociation rate constant for the varied substrate in the denominator. For a more extended definition, see [20,28].

These results are in contrast to the values of 1.15 and 1.0 at, respectively, neutral and high pH for both a-DV/KAcAcCoA and a-DVAcAcCoA in the reaction catalyzed by b-ketoacylACP reductase (FabG) from Streptococcus pneumoniae [32]. The almost full expression of the a-secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects at neutral pH for S. pneumoniae FabG as compared to the small values for M. tuberculosis MabA is most likely a result of the distinct chemical mechanisms proposed for FabG [32] and MabA [15]. FabG follows a stepwise chemical mechanism with hydride transfer from NADPH to AcAc-CoA preceding protonation of the enzyme-bound adduct, and the ``poorly'' committed catalytic step involving hydride transfer gives complete expression of the primary and a-secondary kinetic isotope effects on the experimental kinetic parameters (chemistry is almost completely rate-limiting), consistent with a rapid-equilibrium random mechanism [32]. On the other hand, hydride and solvent proton transfer occur in the same step for MabA, and hydride and solvent proton transfer contribute modestly to the rate-limiting step of the reaction, consistent with a steady-state random mechanism [15]. Although it might be tempting to consider the values observed here at pH 10.0 as intrinsic secondary isotope effects, inasmuch as they are equal to the a-DKeq for NADPH reduction [27], it has been shown that tunneling and coupled motion in the reaction path may result in intrinsic secondary kinetic isotope effects larger than a-DKeq [33,34]. Equilibrium binding of NADPH to the MabA dimer The enhancement in nucleotide fluorescence upon NADPH binding to dimeric MabA was monitored to determine the dissociation constant at equilibrium for MabA­NADPH binary complex formation. A plot of NADPH concentration versus relative fluorescence variation upon binary complex formation (Fig. 3A) was sigmoidal, and the data were accordingly fitted to Eq. (4), yielding values of K 0 = 47 ± 4 lM and n = 2 ± 0.1 (Table 2). The value for K 0 represents a mean dissociation constant [35] for MabA­NADPH binary complex formation, which is comprised of interaction factors and the intrinsic dissociation constant [36]. A Hill plot of the data (Fig. 3B) gave an h = 2 ± 0.3 (obtained from fitting the data to Eq. (5)), in strict agreement with the value for n derived from fitting the data to Eq. (4). These results clearly indicate strong

positive homotropic cooperativity in the binding of NADPH­MabA, since the upper limit value for the Hill coefficient (h) is equal to the number of binding sites (n), which should be two for the dimeric form of MabA in solution. This positive homotropic cooperativity is further supported by the upward-curved double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 3B, inset) of the fluorescence data [36]. The presence of allostery appears to be a feature in the catalytic mechanisms of a number of FabGs, as it has been reported for the enzymes from E. coli [37] and Plasmodium falciparum [38]. Nevertheless, while data presented here for MabA support positive cooperativity for binding of NADPH, negative cooperativity was found for FabG from both P. falciparum and E. coli upon NADPH interaction [37,38]. Interestingly, sigmoidal curves were also reported for the equilibrium interaction between NADH and M. tuberculosis 2-trans-enoyl reductases (InhA) harboring mutations that diminish the enzyme affinity for NADH and render the bacillus resistant to isoniazid [39].

catalyzes the fourth step of M. tuberculosis FAS II [40] and is also a member of the SDR family [41]. In addition, it has been suggested that the components of FAS-II are interconnected by specific protein­protein interactions and that homotypic and heterotypic interactions are essential for proper function of the M. tuberculosis FAS II system [42,43]. Equilibrium data supporting positive cooperativity, as here described for interaction between MabA dimer and NADPH, are consistent with two major mechanisms involving interdependent binding sites (Fig. 4). The first is the concerted mechanism or symmetry model (Fig. 4A) proposed by Monod et al. [44], which predicts that there are two isomers of free enzyme in equilibrium, E and E*, with substrate (NADPH in this case) binding effectively to E and negligibly to E*. The second mechanism is the sequential mechanism (Fig. 4B) derived by Koshland et al. [45], which predicts only one form of free enzyme in solution, substrate binding to one subunit, and a subsequent isomerization step that increases the affinity of the second subunit for the next substrate molecule. In the latter mechanism, the ``linear geometry'' is the only possible arrangement to describe permissible subunit interactions in the case of dimeric MabA. In both mechanisms, isomerization steps are thought to be slower than binding steps. Measurements of binding rate constants are able to distinguish between these two mechanisms [24,46,47], as will be discussed later. AcAcCoA and MabA dimer equilibrium interaction Since increasing AcAcCoA concentrations resulted in high inner filter effect, protein fluorescence spectroscopy could not be employed to determine the dissociation constant at equilibrium for MabA­AcAcCoA binary complex

formation. This interaction was thus assessed by equilibrium dialysis, as described in ``Materials and methods''. A hyperbolic increase was observed for the binding of AcAcCoA to the dimeric form of MabA (Fig. 5), suggesting no positive homotropic cooperativity in the formation of MabA­AcAcCoA binary complex. This proposal is also supported by the linear double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 5, inset), which also rules out negative cooperativity [36]. Fitting the data to Eq. (4) yielded a value of KD = 566 ± 104 lM. This is in agreement with the lack of homotropic cooperativity observed for AcAcCoA binding to P. falciparum FabG [38], and contrary to negative cooperativity shown for the interaction between E. coli FabG and ACP [37]. The experimental results presented here also demonstrate that both NADPH and AcAcCoA can independently interact with MabA to form binary complexes, which corroborates the random order of substrate addition to MabA reported elsewhere [15].

Interaction of substrates with the MabA monomer To assess the possible effects of loss of inter-subunit contacts in the interaction of MabA with its substrates, the binding of either NADPH or AcAcCoA to the monomeric form of MabA was monitored by surface plasmon resonance. Under continuous flow, the non-covalently attached subunits of the dimers are washed out from the chip, resulting in immobilized MabA in a monomeric state. The binding curves were hyperbolic, instead of sigmoidal, for both substrates (Fig. 6A and B), and double-reciprocal plots of the data were linear (Fig. 6A and B, insets), indicating that the cooperative binding of NADPH is abolished when the enzyme is brought to its monomeric form. This is expected since there is just one substrate binding site per MabA subunit [48,49]. Fitting the data to Eq. (6) resulted in apparent KD values of 828 ± 75 lM for NAPDH and 4536 ± 421 lM for AcAcCoA, indicating a reduction of 17- and 8-fold in binding affinity for, respectively, NADPH and AcAcCoA for the MabA monomer as compared to the

affinity for the dimer. These differences represent 1.7 and 1.2 kcal molÀ1 in binding energy loss for interaction of NADPH and AcAcCoA, respectively, with the monomer as compared to the dimer. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised in analyzing these estimates because it is not known how restricting conformation flexibility upon immobilization of a monomer of MabA on a solid support could affect substrate binding. Pre-steady-state kinetics of MabA­NADPH binary complex formation In order to distinguish between the symmetry (concerted) and sequential mechanisms of cooperativity related to the sigmoidal equilibrium binding curve discussed above, the binding of NADPH to MabA in the approach to steady-state was characterized using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. The rate of nucleotide fluorescence enhancement upon NADPH binding to MabA was monophasic, which can thus be best described by a single exponential equation (Fig. 7). The dependence of the apparent rate constants (kobs) on substrate concentration can be utilized to infer on whether or not two forms of free enzyme are present in solution. If free enzyme exists in equilibrium between two forms, E and E*, the former interacting significantly with substrate and the latter interacting negligibly, one expects a decrease in kobs value as the substrate concentration is raised. On the other hand, if there is one form of free enzyme in solution, increasing substrate levels are accompanied by a hyperbolic increase in the value of kobs [24,50,51]. A plot of kobs values against increasing NADPH concentrations showed a hyperbolic decrease in the apparent

rate constants (Fig. 8). These results are consistent with a pre-existing equilibrium of two forms of free MabA in solution followed by a bimolecular association process. Accordingly, the MabA­NADPH binary complex formation proceeds through the concerted mechanism shown in Fig. 4A, with E and E* representing two isomers of free enzyme. This model predicts that the rate constant of association of NADPH to MabA is limited by the first-order isomerization rate constant (k2) from E* to E when NADPH concentration is brought to infinite, since only E binds substrate considerably. Data fitting to Eq. (8) yielded values for k2, kÀ2, (the rate constant for the unimolecular isomerization from E to E* in Fig. 4A) and Kd, the dissociation constant for the E-NADPH binary complex (Table 2). The isomerization process is assumed to be slower than the bimolecular interaction (k1[NADPH] + kÀ1 ) k2 + kÀ2). After correcting the observed amplitude changes of the stopped-flow signal lost in the dead time of the equipment using Eq. (7) [24], the corrected total amplitudes were plotted against increasing NADPH concentrations. This plot showed a sigmoidal curve (Fig. 8, inset), and data were thus fitted to Eq. (4), yielding values of 42 ± 4 lM and 2 ± 0.2 for, respectively, K 0 and n. These results are in strict agreement with the equilibrium fluorescence titration ones (Table 2). Decrease in apparent rate constant upon increase in NAD+ concentration indicated two forms of free glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in equilibrium, which was one of the first examples of allosteric mechanisms discriminated by stopped-flow measurements [52]. Sigmoidal amplitude dependence on increasing NADH concentration was also reported for InhA mutants identified in isoniazidresistance clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, and association rate analysis pointed to two forms of free enzyme in solution [53].

Overall dissociation constant for MabA­NADPH binary complex Analysis of the proposed model for NADPH binding to MabA (Fig. 4A) allows evaluation of the overall dissociation constant (KD(overall)) for the MabA­NADPH binary complex formation, which not only provides information on possible additional steps on the binding sequence but also a means of inspecting the data for internal consistency. The expression for KD(overall) is given by the ratio of the product of the concentrations of all free species to the summation of the concentrations of all complexes, as shown in Eq. (9) for the mechanism in Fig. 4A. K DðoverallÞ ¼ ð½EÃ  þ ½EÞ½NADPH ½E -NADPH þ ½E-NADPH
Ã

ð9Þ

Since the interaction of NADPH with the E* isomer of MabA is assumed to be negligible so that [E-NADPH] ) [E*-NADPH], Eq. (9) reduces to Eq. (10). K DðoverallÞ ¼ ð½EÃ  þ ½EÞ½NADPH ½E-NADPH ð10Þ

The equilibrium constant (K2) for the conversion from E* to E, and Kd are defined in Eqs. (11) and (12), respectively. K2 ¼ ½E k2 Ã ¼ ½E  k À2 ½E½NADPH k À1 ¼ Kd ¼ ½E-NADPH k1 ð11Þ ð12Þ

By rearranging Eqs. (11) and (12) and substituting them into Eq. (10), the expression for KD(overall) is obtained in a form (Eq. (13)) that allows its calculation from k2, kÀ2, and Kd.   1 K DðoverallÞ ¼ K d þ1 ð13Þ K2 A value of KD(overall) = 43 ± 5 lM was obtained using Eq. (13). This value is in excellent agreement with the values of K 0 determined from equilibrium fluorescence titration and analysis of stopped-flow signal amplitudes (Table 2). Furthermore, the close similarity among the KD(overall) and the two K 0 values suggests that no additional steps are present in the mechanism of NADPH binding to free MabA shown in Fig. 4A. Correlation with structural data for MabA Three-dimensional structures of E. coli FabG revealed conformational transitions, triggered by cofactor binding, that lead from a closed form (apoenzyme) to an open structure, with catalytic residues aligned to interact with the substrate [37,54]. These conformational changes were proposed to explain the negative cooperativity observed for the interaction between E. coli FabG and NADPH [37,54]. The MabA crystal structures also showed confor-

mational changes characteristic of the open and closed forms, depending on the absence or presence of NADP(H) in the crystallization mixture, and cofactor-induced fit was evoked to explain such changes [48,49]. The open and closed conformations evoked to be brought about by NADPH binding to MabA [48,49] is in agreement with the sequential mechanism [45] depicted in Fig. 4A. However, the data presented here show that there are two forms in equilibrium of free MabA in solution with different affinity for NADPH (Fig. 4A) consistent with the symmetry model [44]. Based on the data reported here for MabA­NADPH interaction, it is tempting to suggest the existence of both open (E) and closed (E*) forms of free MabA in the crystals. A value of 0.43 ± 0.02 can be estimated for K2 (Eq. (11)), indicating that the closed isomer (E*) is favored in the absence of NADPH, which may account for the closed conformation assigned to the apoenzyme [48]. The open conformation predominantly seen in the presence of NADP(H) [49] is probably a consequence of the equilibrium displacement toward the E isomer, rather than a cofactor-induced fit. This reasoning is also in agreement with the observation of a mixture of open (predominant) and closed conformations in the structures obtained from cofactor-containing crystals [49,55]. Therefore, the structurally similar conformations reported for E. coli FabG [54] and for MabA [49] in the presence of cofactor probably have mechanistically distinct foundations. Summary In the present report, a-secondary kinetic deuterium isotope effects determined at both pH 7.0 and 10.0 probed for the modest contribution of the re-hybridization occurring at C-4 of nicotinamide ring for the rate-limiting step of the reaction catalyzed by M. tuberculosis b-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (MabA), as well as for the deuterium-sensitive step and the pH-sensitive step being the same. In addition, equilibrium binding studies revealed the existence of positive homotropic cooperativity in the MabA­NADPH binary complex formation, but lack of cooperativity in the interaction of AcAcCoA with the enzyme. Pre-steady-state evaluation of the kinetics of NADPH binding demonstrated that there are two forms of free MabA in solution, consistent with a concerted mechanism of allostery. Calculation of the KD(overall) suggested no additional steps in the binding mechanism shown in Fig. 4A. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of positive homotropic cooperativity and pre-steady-state kinetics of binding for a b-ketoacyl-ACP reductase. The results described here are expected to be useful in the design of new and potent inhibitors of MabA activity.
