Abstract--Immunoglobin E (IgE) binds to the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells and basofils and causes release of inflammatory compounds that leads to allergic diseases. Inhibition of the ligand binding could lead to blockade of the release of inflammation causing compounds and thus alleviate asthma and other allergic diseases. Natural product screening and bioassay-guided isolation of an extract of Aspergillus sp. led to the identification of three novel 11-membered macrocyclic biphenyl ether lactones, aspercyclides A­C. Aspercyclide A inhibited the IgE binding with an IC50 of 200 lM. The isolation, structure elucidation, absolute stereochemistry, and the binding activities of these compounds are described.

Allergic disorders are caused by mediators from mast cells and basofils.1 Allergen specific immunoglobin E (IgE) binds to the high-affinity IgE receptor on these cells. Cross linking of these complexes by multivalent allergens activates a signal transduction pathway resulting in the release of mediators containing granulocytes. The IgE receptor comprises of four chains (a, b, and c2). The a-chain (the extracellular soluble domain) binds to the constant region of IgE whereas the b and c chains are required for membrane insertion and signal transduction. Molecules that bind to the high-affinity IgE receptor prevent IgE binding and release of inflammatory compounds, thus preventing symptoms associated with allergic diseases. Therefore such molecules that target the high-affinity receptor and block IgE binding may be efficacious in treating asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other forms of atopy.2­4 Screening of natural product extracts of microbial origin using a Myeloma a1/a2-IgE receptor binding ELISA assay led to the identification of a fungal extract with the requisite activity. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the extract led to the isolation of three novel compounds named aspercyclide A (1a), B (1b), and C (2). Aspercyclide A inhibited the IgE receptor binding activity with

an IC50 value of 200 lM. The isolation, structure elucidation, absolute stereochemistry, and biological activity of these compounds are described. The producing organism (MF6215) was isolated from a soil sample collected in Olduvai Gorge, Upper Strata in Tanzania and was identified as Aspergillus sp. It was grown on a seed medium containing in (g/L) yeast extract (4), malt extract (8), glucose (4), and Junlon (1.5) in distilled water at pH 7.0 at 25 °C for 5 days. It was then transferred to AD4 liquid production medium consisting of (in g/L) glucose (100), corn meal (10), soybean meal (4), oat flour (5), peptone (5), yeast extract (5), CaCO3 (5), V8 juice (80 mL), and trace elements (1 mL) in distilled water at pH 7.0. Fifty milliliter portions of the production media were transferred into

250 mL nonbaffled-Erlenmeyer flasks and grown for 19 days at 22 °C. Fermentation broth was extracted with 1.2 volumes of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) by shaking on a shaker for 30 min. A 30 mL MEK extract was chromatographed on Sephadex LH20 in MeOH. A 2/3rd portion of the active fraction was chromatographed on silica gel preparative TLC using 3% MeOH­CH2Cl2 leading to the isolation of 1a (4.2 mg, 210 mg/L), 1b (2.0 mg, 100 mg/L), 2 (2.0 mg, 100 mg/L) as colorless amorphous powders.5 Aspercyclide A (1a). HREIMS analysis of 1a produced a molecular formula of C24H26O6 (found m/z 410.1780, calcd m/z 410.1729) suggesting the presence of 12 degrees of unsaturations. The UV spectrum of 1a exhibited absorption bands at kmax 212, 266, and 348 nm indicating the presence of multiple independent highly conjugated systems. The infrared spectrum showed absorption bands for hydroxy (mmax 3442 cmÀ1), ester (1719), aldehyde, and aromatic groups. The 13C NMR spectrum (Table 1) of aspercyclide A showed the presence of 24 carbon signals that were assigned to two methyls, four methylenes, seven olefinic methines, two oxymethines, and one aldehyde. Of the remaining carbon signals, one was assigned to an ester carbonyl and the rest to olefinic quaternary carbons. One of the methyl groups appeared as a triplet in the 1H NMR spectrum (Table 1) of 1a at d 0.95 (J = 6.8 Hz)

indicative of a terminal ethyl group. The second methyl appeared as a singlet at d 2.38 indicative of an aromatic methyl group. The 1H NMR spectrum showed the presence of a pair of doublets for ortho-coupled aromatic protons at d 7.53 and 6.95, and two doublets (d 6.90 and d 6.69) both coupled to a triplet (d 7.15) typical of a 1,2,3-aromatic system. The 1H­1H connectivity was verified by the COSY spectrum. This was suggestive of the presence of 1,2,3-tri- and 1,2,3,4-tetra-substituted aromatic rings. The remaining pair of olefinic protons appeared as a doublet (d 6.45, J = 16.0 Hz) and a doublet of doublets (d 6.07, J = 16.0, 9.2 Hz) indicating a trans-olefin. The two oxymethines appeared as a triplet (d 4.17, J = 9.2 Hz) and a doublet of a triplet (d 5.30, J = 2.0, 9.2 Hz). The COSY spectrum of 1a indicated that one side of the olefin (H-17) was coupled to the oxymethine triplet (H-18), which showed cross peaks to the other oxymethine H-19, which in turn showed cross peaks to the methylene (H2-20). Extended COSY correlations of H2-20 to the respective side chain protons established C16­C24 spin system (Fig. 1). This spin system was supported by requisite HMBC correlations. The three contiguous spin systems were connected to each other by HMBC experiments acquired with n JCH = 7, 5, and, 3 Hz (Fig. 1). The olefinic methyl group displayed the HMBC correlations to three carbons C-3 (d 127.7), C-4 (d 136.7), and C-5 (d 125.7). The aromatic triplet at d 7.15 showed three bond HMBC correlations to C-4 and to an oxygen-bearing aromatic carbon (d 155.4) assigned to C-8. Lastly, a four-bond HMBC correlation (only at nJCH = 3 Hz) of H-7 to the only ester

carbonyl (d 169.3) indicated the ester substitution at C-3. The HMBC correlations of the olefinic proton H-16 to the aromatic carbons C-10 (d 146.3) and C-15 (d 136.5) helped to connect one end of the olefin (C-16) to the second aromatic ring at C-15. The remaining three substitutions of the second aromatic ring were established by HMBC correlations of H-11 to C-10, C13 (d 161.2), and C-15; OH-13 to C-12 (d 118.9), C-13 and C-14 (d 119.8); and the aldehyde proton to C-13 and C-14. The downfield shifted methine proton (H19) displayed key HMBC correlation to the ester carbonyl (C-2) thus establishing the connection of C-19 to C-2 via O-1 and confirming the 11-membered lactone ring. The HMBC experiments were not useful for the establishment of the diphenyl ether linkage, which was established by the observation of reciprocating NOEÕs between aromatic protons H-7 and H-11 (Fig. 2) and was supported by the chemical shifts of the oxygen-bearing carbons C-8 and C-10. The relative stereochemistry of aspercyclide A was elucidated by the ChemDraw 3D modeling, coupling constants and NOE measurements. H-18 exhibited 9.2 Hz couplings each with H-17 and H-19. ChemDraw 3D minimized structure revealed dihedral angles of 160° and 170° between H17­H18 and H18­H19 that supported the observed 9.2 Hz J values. H-19 displayed 2 and 9.2 Hz couplings with the methylene protons at

C-20 supported by dihedral angles of 64° (H-20b) and 178° (H-20a), respectively. Irradiation of the olefinic proton H-17 exhibited strong NOE to H-19 indicating their syn-disposition. The other olefin proton H-16 afforded NOE enhancements to the aldehyde proton H-26 and H-18 suggesting the syn-relationship of H-16 and H-18. These two sets of NOEÕs suggested the opposite facial transpositions of the H17­H19 and H16­H18 and confirmed anti-relationships of H-18 and H-19. The absolute stereochemistry of aspercyclide A was elucidated by Mosher ester method.6 The reaction of 1a with (R)- and (S)-MTPA chlorides afforded bis-(S)and (R)-MTPA esters 3a and 3b. The chemical shift differential Dd (dS À dR, Fig. 3) suggested R and S stereochemistries at C-18 and C-19, respectively. Aspercyclide B (1b). HREIMS of 1b afforded a molecular formula of C24H28O6 (found m/z 412.1886, m/z calcd 412.1886) indicating that it possessed two extra hydrogens compared to 1a. The UV spectrum exhibited absorption bands at kmax 214 and 280 nm and indicated the absence of the absorption maxima of kmax 348 nm due to the loss of extended conjugation. The comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 1b and 1a indicated the absence of the aldehyde group and the presence of an ABq for an oxy-methylene (dH 4.82; dC 61.4). The 1 H and 13C NMR shifts of 1b were fully assigned by 2D NMR spectra including HMBC and are summarized in Table 1. Thus, structure 1b was assigned for aspercyclide B. Aspercyclide C (2). A molecular formula of C23H26O5 (found m/z 382.1746, calcd m/z 382.1780) was obtained for 2 by mass spectral analysis. The comparison of the formula of 2 with 1a suggested the loss of a CO group. The UV spectrum of 2 was similar to the UV spectrum of 1b. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 2 indicated the absence of the aldehyde group compared to 1a and the presence of an additional aromatic proton suggesting the substitution of the aldehyde group with the proton. However, analysis of the 1H NMR spectrum suggested that the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring connected to olefin must be different from 1a and 1b. The remaining part of the spectrum of 2 was similar to the

While anti-IgE antibodies have been developed as potent IgE antagonists, the search for small molecule antagonists has not been successful except for the discovery of b-hairpin11 and zeta (IC50 = 0.032 lM)4 peptides. To the best of our knowledge aspercyclide A is the first small molecule inhibitor of this protein­protein interaction.

corresponding spectrum of 1a and 1b. The H NMR spectrum (Table 1) showed the presence of a pair of aromatic doublets and a triplet all with ortho-couplings suggesting a 1,2,3-substitution leading to two potential substitution positions for the free phenolic group either at C-11 or at C-14. The structure was unambiguously assigned by the HMBC correlations of H-16 (Fig. 4), which showed strong HMBC correlations to three aromatic carbons (C-10, C-14, and C-15). Of these, only one of the carbons bears an oxygen substitution thus establishing the phenolic group at C-11. This assignment was supported by the oxygen induced chemical shifts of C-10 and C-11. Based on these data structure 2 was assigned to aspercyclide C. IgE receptor binding activity. Aspercyclides A­C were evaluated in a receptor binding ELISA assay using Myeloma IgE, the truncated soluble a-chain of the IgE receptor7 in the supernatant from Baculo virus infected Sf9 cells, biotin labeled goat anti-IgE, Eu labeled streptavidin, and monoclonal anti-KT3 antibody8 in 96-well plates.9 cDNA coding for the truncated a-chain of IgE fused to the KT3 peptide (Lys-Pro-Pro-Thr-Pro-ProPro-Glu-Pro-Glu-Thr) was cloned into Baculo virus. Under standard assay conditions IgE bound to the receptor with EC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Aspercyclide A inhibited the IgE binding to its receptor by an IC50 value of 200 lM. The other two compounds were much less active (IC50 > 200 lM) suggesting that the aldehyde group plays a prominent role in the binding activity. In summary, we have described the isolation and structure of three novel 11-membered diphenyl ether macrolide10 fungal metabolites. One of these macrolides showed modest inhibition of IgE binding to high-affinity
