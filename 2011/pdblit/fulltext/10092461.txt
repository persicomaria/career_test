The semisynthetic Co-substituted bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutasea (SOD) has been crystallized in a new crystalline form and the structure determined at 20 A (1 A = 01 nm) resolution. The crystals belong to space group P2,2,21 with cell constants: a = 51.0, b = 147.6, c = 47.5 A, and contain one dimeric molecule of 32,000 M, per asymmetric unit. The structure has been solved by molecular replacement techniques using the Cu,Zn bovine enzyme as a search model, and refined by molecular dynamics with the crystallographic pseudo-energy term, followed by conventional crystallographic refinement. The R-factor for the 18,964 unique reflections in the resolution range from 10-O to 2-O A is 0,176 for a model comprising 2188 protein atoms and 0200 solvent molecules; the root-mean-square deviation from the ideal bond lengths is 0010 A, and the average atomic temperature factor is 26.5 A2. The dimeric molecule of the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits related by a non-crystallographic S-fold axis. The subunit has as its structural scaffolding the conventional SOD-flattened antiparallel eight-stranded P-barrel, with three external loops. The co-ordination geometry of the metal center in the active site is fairly well preserved when compared with the native Cu,Zn bovine enzyme, Co2+ is in tetrahedral co-ordination, while the Cu2+ ligands show an uneven distortion from the square planar geometry. The least-squares superposition of the metals ligands and the catalytically important ArgJ41 of the native and Co-substituted enzyme yields a root-mean-square value of 0401 A, the largest deviation occurring at the Co2+ ligand As~81.~ An additional copper ligand, compatible with a water molecule, is observed at 2.38 A from Cu2+ in the active-site channel, at the supposed binding site of the 0; anion substrate. Several ordered water molecules have been observed on the protein surface and in the active-site channel; their structural locations coincide remarkably with those of related distant superoxide water molecules found in the crystal structure of the phylogenetically dismutase from yeast.

Since the initial investigation on this enzyme. a major problem has been that the Zn2 + ion is optically and magnetically silent. In this respect a derivativr has been prepared in which Co(H) has selectively replaced the native Zn(I1) ion (Calabrese ef al.. 1972). The introduction of such chromophoric probe has provided the opportunity to perform several spectroscopic studies in order to elucidate the str`uczture-function relationship of the metal &ster. First of all, the Cu,Co derivative was found to be elrc%rolr paramagnetic resonance silent (Rotilio d al.. 1974), due to the magnetic coupling occurring between thfa two metals (Morgenst,ern-Radaran d al.. 1986) and this property was used to propose close proximit? between the two metals, before X-ray data were available. The presence of such a coupling allowt~d detection of the proton nuclear magnet'ic resonanct~ (n.m.r.) signals of the amino acid side-chains (Y)ordinated to the metal (aluster and in particular of the copper-bound histidines in cases in which t htl first co-ordination sphere of the copper is scblect ivel! (Bertini it al.. 1985). These propert,& perturbed have been recently used to investigate the p~~rturbxtion of the n.m .r. spectrum caused FJ: t,hr> additiotl of negatively charged anions (Kertlnl et ~1.. 1985: Paci e1 al.. 1988), which are supposed to by good substrate analogues. Furthermore. since the ('u.( "o derivative has a catalytic rficiency comparabk to that of t,he native enzyme. the chromophorr proptar ties of the cobalt site enabled the involvement of t,htb zinc in t,he ca,talytic mechanism to bc monitored. (McAdam et al., 1977). In view of this csonsideration. it is fundamental to assess the structural identity of t)he zinc and cobalt, enzymes by direct, analysis. with particular reference to the potentialities of tl. m .r. approaches, such as t,wo-dimensional n.m.r. and t,hr nuclear Overhauser effect,, which require unatnbof resonances on the basis of guous assignment, proper crystallographic co-ordinates. We have crystallized Cu,Co bovine SOD$ in a new crystalline form suitable for high-resolution crystal lographic investigation. Tn this paper we report the experimental details pertaining t,o solution of t)h<, structure by molecular replacement and crystallographic refinement by means of the molecular dynamics technique, at a resolution of 2.0 ~1. A description of the structure in relation to that of the bovine SOD parent enzyme is reported.

1. Introduction
Among the metalloproteins superoxide dismutases (SOD?) are almost unique enzymes, since they may contain either copper and zinc, or manganese or iron at the active site center. These proteins are considered to be widespread detoxifying enzymes, whose function is to disproportionate two superoxide radical anions into one molecule of oxygen and one of hydrogen peroxide (Fielden et al., 1974). While iron and manganese SOD can be traced to a common evolutionary origin, sharing well-defined molecular architecture, based on a common polypeptide chain of 20,000 M,, the Cu? Zn SOD is based on a polypeptide chain of 16,000 M,. thus totally unrelated to the other SODS (Stallings et al.. 1984). Cu,Zn SOD is active in solution as a homodimer, each chain hosting an independent active site containing the Cu2+,Zn2+ pair. The active-site crevice hosts positively charged residues that participate in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme, providing an electrostatic field that drives the substrate to the redox copper-zinc center for dismutation (Desideri et at., 1991). From a crystallographic viewpoint SODS from three different sources have been subjects of atomic resolution analyses. The three-dimensional structure of the enzymes from bovine erythrocytes (Tainer et al., 1982), spinach chloroplasts (Kitagawa et al.; 1991) and yeast (Djinovic ,et al., 1991) have been reported at 2.0, 2.0 and 2.5 A (1 A = @l nm) resolution, respec:tively; providing independent views of the same catalytic unit from widely different evolutionary sources. These investigations have shown that the enzyme tertiary structure is strongly conserved, and based on a Greek-key /?-barrel, topologically composed of two P-sheets of four b-strands each (Getzoff et al., 1989). Three of the major loops connecting P-strands in the barrel define a deep surface cleft, which accommodates the active-site ion pair. The co-ordination sphere of the two metal ions is strongly conserved in all Cu,Zn SODS and consists of four histidine residues in distorted square planar co-ordination around the Cu2 +, and of three histidines and one aspartate in distorted tetrahedral co-ordination around the Zn2+. The direct copper ligands are three NE2 atoms from residues His46, His61, and Hisll8, and one ND1 atom donated from the His44 side-chain; His61 is a bridging residue between Cu2+ and Zn2+, which is thus directly co-ordinated to ND1 atoms of His61, His69 and His78 and to ODl of Asp81. A fifth ligaad has been observed in the active-site channel at 2 A from the Cu2+, while the imidazole ring of His61 defines a plane containing both metal ions.

ethylene glycol (PEG, average M, = 4000) and @1 M-NaCl were equilibrated against a reservoir solution containing 16:/, (w/v) PEG at the same pH, at room temperature. The crystals grew as elongated prisms of about 1.2 mm x03 mm x@3 mm in 1 to 2 months. The preliminary characterization of the crystal form obtained under these conditions was performed by photographic methods from inspection of precession photographs. The crystals were found to be in the orthorhombic space group P2,212, with cell constants a = 51.0, b = 147.6, c = 475 A; assuming that the asymmetric unit contains one SOD dimer, the solvent content of this crystalline 1968). Under the same is 56% (Matthews, form experimental conditions isomorphous crystals of the native Cu,Zn b-SOD could be grown. Two crystals, mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary, were used for data collection using the synchrotron radiation source at the EMBL X11 beamline at the DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg, employing a locally developed image plate system as detector and a wavelength of 1.009 A. The DORIS ring was operating in a single-bunch mode at 5.3 GeV and 40 to 100 mA, with approximately 3h between injections. The crystal was mounted on an Arndt-Wonacott oscillation camera (Nyborg & Wonacott. 1977) with the [ 1001 direction parallel to the rotation axis. and was constantly kept at 4°C by a stream of dry cooled air. The crystal-to-det)ector distances were 261 and 200 mm for low- and high-resolution data collection, respectively, and exposure times ranged between 7 and 1064 s: accordingly, the high-resolution data set (up to 2.0 A spacing). on the first crystal, were collected using 3", 2" and 1.5" rotation angular ranges. A second crystal was used t.o record the blind region data as well as part of the high-resolution reflections using angular rotation ranges of 075". 1.0". 1.5" and 2.0". Refinement of orientation and integration of the intensities were performed using the MOSFLM suite of programs (Leslie et al., 1986) modified for processing of the image plate data. Merging of the observed intensities into a unique data set of reflections was carried out using ROTAVATA/AGROVATA programs from the CCP4 suite. supplied by the SERC Daresbury Laboratory (U.K.). The intensities were converted to structure factor amplit,udes using the program TRUNCATE (French & Wilson. 1978). A total of 116,401 measurements were merged to yield 18,964 unique reflections (7>.2?; of the t)heoret,ical reflections in the 10.0 to 2.0 A resolution range). The merging R, factor (R, = ElIi- <I>l/ClIJ, where Ii is the intensity of an observation, <I > is the mean value of t,he reflection. and the summations are over all reflections) was 6-So/;.

The starting model for the molecular replacement investigat.ion was the .`orange-yellow" dimer of t,he bovine Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase. partially refined at, 2.0 A resolution, to an R-factor of 2%5 o/0 (Tainer et al., 1982). and deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernst.ein et nl.. 1977) as dataset 2SOD. The MERLOT (Fitzgerald. 1988) parkage of programs, which includes the fast-rotation function of Crowther (1972), the rotation function of Lattman & Love (1970) and a translation of Crowt,her & Blow (1967), was used function throughout. The searcxh model was placed in an-orthogqnal reference cell with dimensions of 100 A x 100 A x 100 A for calculation of the structure factors used to generate harmonic eoeficients for the fast rotation function. The structure factors were calculated up to 3.0 A spacings with an

overall temperature factor (B) at @O A" in order to sharpen the peaks. The harmonic coefficients were calculated with upper and lower limit,s of 35 and 8.0 8, respectively; the integration radius being set to 2@5 A. The Eulerian angle increments between successive calculations of the rotation function were 2.5" for CI, 1' for p and 5" for y. The origin-removed cross-rotation-function analysis gave a rotation peak with a r.m.s. value of 654 (r.m.s. is t,he root-mean-square deviation from the mean). As the success in determining the correct t'ranslation of the model is highly dependent on how accurate the oriented rotation angles are, the rotation function of Lattman & Love (1970) was applied in order to "refine" the determined rotation angles on a finer grid (11 steps of 1" around each angle) using the diffraction data between 100 and 40 A. In order to position the dimers with respect to the symmetry elements. the refined values of crystallographic the rotation search angles in Eulerian space were used. The correctness of the solution was assessed on the basis of an internally consistent set of vectors from the 3 Harker sections in the translation function. and of packing considerations. Calculations of a translation function map on a 1.0 A grid, for the data between l@O and 4 8, for the 3 Harker sections (X = l/2: r = l/2: 2 = l/2) gave a self-consistent set of vectors. The initial and with the refined values of the eulerian angles. along results of the translation search calculations are reported in Table 1. The solution was subsequently submitted to R-value minimization dWard et al., 1975) using the data between 10.0 and 40 A, with a decrease in the R-factor value from 046 to 0.43. The initial R-value for the correctly oriented and positioned model was 0.385. for the intensity data between 7.0 and 40 A resolution. A rigid body refinement process, allowing 3 positional and 3 rotational paramet'ers to vary independently for each of the 2 chains in the asymmetric unit, was st.arted in the 7-O to 4.0 A resolution range with an overall B factor of 2@0 A', using the program TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987). The rigid body refinement did not yield any significant decrease in the conventional R-fartor after 3 cycles. This can possibly be explained by the very tight contact between the 2 subunits forming a functional dimer. which cannot be affected by t.he different crystalline forms. and. on the other hand. by a fairly precise molecular replacement solution. The refinement of the model proceeded with 8 cycles of conventional crystallo-

graphic refinement of the co-ordinates, with stereochemical restraints, for the intensity data in the resolution range from 6.0 to 35 A. As shown in Table 2, this procedure also did not bring about rapid decrease in the R-factor. Therefore, after inspection of the electron density map, the refinement was continued using molecular dynamics simulation with a crystallographic pseudo-energy term, because of its larger radius of convergence, owing to the presence of the kinetic energy that allows the conformational barriers to be overcome. (c) Molecular dynamics and conventional rejnement The GROMOS suite of programs (van Gunsteren & Berendsen, 1987) was used for molecular dynamics refinement of the starting positioned and oriented model, which was not manually corrected for bad stereochemistry and/ or contacts in any way. Pseudo-energy minimization was first'performed (EMX, a combination of energy minimization with X-ray restraints) to remove the initial strain in the structure due to bad contacts and poor chain stereochemistry. Molecular dynamics refinement including crystallographic potential (MDX) was typically performed in series of 605 to 0.6 ps per cycle, consisting of steps of At = 2 fs. The balance between the crystallographic Rfactor and the energy term was controlled applying a weight cr, to the X-ray potential term. EMX refinement in the resolution range from 6.0 to 30 A (100 cycles) was followed by the MDX re$nement at T = 300 K for the data between 6.0 and 30 A, and an isothermal algorithm (Berendsen et al., 1984) was applied to keep the overall temperature constant, using the temperature relaxation time z = 61 ps. No restraints on bond lengths and on the non-crystallographic P-fold axis relating the 2 subunits in the functional dimer of the asymmetric unit were used during EMX and MDX refinement procedures, R-factors of 290 A' being assigned to each atom. The ox value for this stage of refinement was chosen to be approximately 60% of the observed ur value {CQ= [ < (IF,]--]F,])*> I*}. and was gently increased during the refinement procedure (low value of 8, means high weight for the X-ray energy terms). Subsequently the resolution was increased to 2.3 A spacing, limiting the low-resolution data to 60 A in order to avoid the contribution of the solvent structure at lower-angle data. After 2.75 ps simulation time (R = 0.276) the model was submitted to EMX refinement, followed by the refinement of isotropic temperature factors using the TNT suite of programs (Tronrud et aE., 1987). The refinement of the model with individual thermal parameters proceeded with the data in the 60 to

2.1 A resolution range; after an additional 1 ps of simulationO time the crystallographic data were increased to 2.0 A resolution. and, after a total of 4.9 ps. the refinement of the thermal parameters was Forformed again for the intensity data between 60 and 2.0 A. The model with updated individual isotropic B-factors was submitted to an additional 2.7 ps of MDX simulation, followed by EMX refinement in order to release t'he system's kinetic energy. This procedure led to an R-factor of6243 for the crystallographic data between 6.0 and 2.0 A. lip to this stage of the refinement no manual intervention was applied to the Cu,Co b-SOD model. The course of the rigid body and molecular dynamics refinement is presented in Table 2. The refinement of this molecular model was then con tinued by conventional restrained crystallographic refinement of the co-ordinates and temperature factors using the TNT suite of programs (Tronrud et al., 1987). Electron density maps with coefficients (2]1p,]- ]E',]) and (IF,] - IF,]) and calculated phases were computed at regular intervals. whenever convergence of the refinement to a local minimum was detected by a limited decrease in the Kfactor and by small r.m.s. shifts in the stereochemical parameters, indicating the need for manual intervention. Table 3 gives a summary of the crystallographic refinement in terms of R-values and r.m.s. co-ordinates shifts. Four stages of restrained crystallographic refinement of factors, alternated wit,h co-ordinates and temperature model-building sessions on a graphics station, using the FRODO modelling program (Jones, 1978)> led to a final R-value of 0176 fo: the 18,876 observed structure factors in the 160 to 20 A resolution range. The metal-ligand bond-length restraints applied were taken from Orpen et al. (1989), as the average value of the respective bonds observed in low M, co-ordination compounds. After step B of the conventional crystallographic refinement the contribution of the ordered water molecules located in the difference electron density maps was included in t,he model. The solvent molecules were critically re-examined during each subsequent manual refitting of the model on the basis of hydrogen bonding criteria and of their temperature factors. Systematic inspections of difference electron density maps led to inclusion of 200 ordered solvent molecules in the present, model. During t,he last stage of the least-squares refinement the occupancies of the water molecules were refined as well. Table 4 presents the parameters of the final cycle of the refinement for t,he Cu,Co b-SOD model.

were carried out at the University of Pavia. The Figures were prepared using the molecular graphics package WHATIF (Vriend, 1990). The structure factors and the co-ordinate data sets of Cu,Co b-SOD have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977), from which copies may be obtained.

3. Results and Discussion
(a) Quality of the model The quality of the refined Cu,Co b-SOD model has been assessed on the basis of the observed structure factors, using the (TV method proposed by Read (1986). From the analysis of the data repprted in Figure 1, a r.m.s. co-ordinate error of O-20 A can be derived. The overall stereochemistry of the model is close to ideality; a summary of the main stereochemical parameters describing the structure, as calculated by the TNT program package (Tronrud et al., 1987) is presented in Table 4. The electron density is well defined throughout the two polypeptide chains contained in the asymmetric unit, except for some of the larger side-chains (see Table 5), on the surface of the model, that show weak electron density and cannot be fitted properly to it. The calculation of the so-called "real space R-factor" (Jones et al., 1991) on a per-residue basis is given in Figure 2(a). Correspondingly, a profile

of the refined main chain B-factors per residue is shown in Figure 2(b). The average temperature factor for the whole model, including 200 water molecules, is 265 8". The average temperature factor of 2127 protein non-hydrogen atoms considered in the structure factor calculations is 24.4 A'. The inspection of the torsional angles +,t/~ defining the polypeptide chain conformation does not highlight evident deviations from the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Fig. 3), with the exception of residues Ser66, Leu124 and Asn137, in both chains. All other residues displaying a positive value for the 4 conformational angle (see Fig. 3) are glycine. It is remarkable that, for Leu124, the same left-handed helical conformation is found in b-SOD and in y-SOD (Djinovic et al., 1991, 1992). The general model derived for Cu,Co b-SOD, presented in Figure 4, has been compared with the starting "orange-yellow" dimer of the Cu,Zn b-SOD

On the other hand, the sidechains of Asp25 of bot'h subunits form side-chain-toside-chain hydrogen bonds to Asn63 and Lys68, respectively. Another main chain-to-main chain hydrogen bond between symmetry-related B subunits, stabilizing the crystal structure of Cu,Co b-SOD, is formed between the Pro100 0 (of the 4,7 loop) and the Glu131 N atom of the a-helical region. Residue Glu130 of the A subunit is involved in the intermolecular contacts to the main chain atoms of the 4 monomer Tyr108 N, (2.49 A), Ser105 0 by water (3.11 A) and Glu107 N (2.89 A) mediated molecule OH 1139, as shown in Figure 6, and also forms a direct contact to the0 nitrogen atom of symmetry-related Glu107 (3.12 A).

Glu130 of the A subunit is involved in the intermolecular crystal contacts, bridged by means of a solvent molecule, as discussed above, to the symmetry-related A subunit, as well as in a weak polar interaction with Lys134 of the same subunit. The carboxylate group of Glu130 in the B polypeptide chain does not participate in intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen-bon+ng interactions. An alternative salt bridge of 3.33 A between Lys134 and Glu131 is formed in the B subunit, neutralizing the opposite charges of the two side-chains.

In the Cu,Co b-SOD structure the Argll3 NH2 atom is connected to Gln47 OEl atom of the same subunit by means of the hydrogen bond interaction mediated by water molecules OH 1063 in the A, and OH 1054 in the B subunit, respectively.

Inspection of the co-ordination geometry of the two metal ions indicates that Co'+ , as expected, is in tetrahedral co-ordination, whereas the four protein ligands of copper form a distorted square planar coordination sphere. An additional ligand for copper whose density is coqpatible with a water molecule is observed at 2,38 A from Cu'+ in the active-site Table 8

channel leading to the protein surface. This is the supposed substrate binding site that is occupied by 0; during catalysis. The catalytic cycle of Cu,Zn SOD is under the direct control of a number of charged residues that build up the electrostatic field in the active site, and participate in successfully guiding and orienting the superoxide anion (Desideri et al., 1989; Getzoff et al., 1989; Sines et al., 1990; Desideri et al., 1991). It is therefore relevant to compare the conformations of such residues in the active sites of the two enzymes, which differ by the Zn*++Co*+ "point substitution". Figure 8 shows the residues that are believed to be relevant for the electrostatics of the active site in the two enzymes, after least-squares superposition of the two C" chains. It can be readily appreciated that residue Argl41 maintains essentially an identical conformation in the two proteins, in relation to its substrate binding and orienting function. On the other hand, the other charged residues examined do not show a comparable conservation of their orientation. Residue Lys134 is also believed to participate in the electrostatic guidance of the substrate in the active site, although its contribution is probably mediated by the presence of the Glu130 negative charge. In both chains of Cu,Co b-SOD the electron density of the side-chain of Lys134 is well defined, and indicates that the Lys134 NZ atom of the A tubunit interacts with the Glu130 OE2 atom (372 A); in the-B subunit an alternative polar interaction of 3.33 A with the sidechain of Glu131 is observed, which however shows a slightly different conformation from that observed in the Cu,Zn protein. In the context of the electrostatic control of the b-SOD activity, the role of residues Glu119 and Lysl20 has recently been questioned, on the basis of the computer-simulated enzyme/substrate encounter through the use of Brownian dynamics, and considering the observed substitution of both these residues with neutral amino acids in the primary structure of SODS displaying almost identical catalytic parameters

(Sines et al., 1999). Also the conformation of residue Asp122, playing an important role in the structure of the active site cavity, because it bridges through hydrogen bonds His44 (co-ordinated to copper) and His69 (co-ordinated to zinc), is highly preserved in the two proteins. In the active-site region an almost ideal network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules stretches from the copper ion's fifth ligand along the molecular space between the disulfide region of the 6,5 loop and the a-helix and the 138 to 141 segment of the polypeptide chain. Comparing the structure of the solvent in this region with that observed in y-SOD, striking similarities can be noticed despite only 55% sequence identity between the two phylogenetically distant proteins, implying a structural and functional role for the solvent itself. Indeed, a number of ordered water molecules are found in almost identical positions, participating in the scaffolding of the protein structure and in the orientation of the side-chains, by means of a complex hydrogen-bonding scheme. In particular, the positions of OH 1028, 1041, 1045, 1046, 1047, 1070, 1126, 1131 are strongly conserved in the two proteins, Among these, the four solvent peaks numbered OH 1046, OH 1126, OH 1047 and OH 1131, once overlayed on the y-SOD structure (on the basis of the proteins C" backbones only) are found to fall within the r.m.s. distance (as calculated from the comparison of the two enzymes) from equivalent solvent molecules in y-SOD. Inspection of the two protein structures shows that this coincidence is not fortuitous and reflects a structural role for these water molecules with respect to the activesite residues. Water molecules OH 1047 and OH 1131 are mostly responsible for the inaccessibility of the active-site center, together with the side-chain of Arg141. On the other hand, this side-chain is hydrogen bonded to OH 1947 and through this to OH 1131, which in turn is hydrogen bonded to Gly139 0. Moreover, the copper ion's fifth ligand (OH 1991) is hydrogen bonded to OH 1131. Another

water molecule (OH 1046), playing a structural role in the protein, hydrogen bonds to the His61 ND1 (the copper-cobalt bridging residue) and Lys134 0 atoms in the a-helical region. The remarkable coincidence of the location of several water molecules in two enzymes that are phylogenetically distant, but which nevertheless quite comparable catalytic properties display (O'Neill et al., 1988), stresses the relevance of the solvent contribution in stabilizing the protein's tertiary structure and possibly in supporting its activity. Bearing in mind that the catalytic substrate of SOD is a small charged dioxygen anion whose dimensions compare favorably with those of a water molecule, it is possible that the solvent molecules observed in the strict neighborhood of the active site of the two different SODS indicate successive steps in the diffusion process of the substrate to the redox center. In this respect it is unfortunate that no solvent structure is yet available for the monoclinic crystal form of the Cu,Zn b-SOD. (f) Comparison of the active sites

The fairly high level of conservation of the active-site geometry in the &Co b-SOD, wit'h respect to the Cu,Zn b-SOD, is in line with t#he essentially identical catalytical properties of the native and semisynthetic enzymes (Calabrese el al., 1972; McAdam et al., 1977). The most important of this work is, however, the availconsequence ability of the crystallographic co-ordinates at 2.0 A for the Cu,Co b-SOD derivative, which will permit' the definitive assignation of the n.m.r. paramagnetic shifts in order to compare structures determined by crystallographic and solution methods (Banci et al., 1989; Paci et al.. 1988, 1990).

Concerning the perturbation of the enzyme active site structure in the presence of the foreign Co2+, Figure 9 shows an overlay of Cu,Co b-SOD active site with the native enzyme. The overlay has been performed taking into account only the active-site atoms shown: namely, those belonging to the amino acids directly co-ordinated to the metal ions, and Arg141. After least-squares superposit$on of the t'wo atom sets an r.m.s. value of 0.401 A is observed. Tnspection of the overlaid structures shows that the largest deviation present in Cu,Co b-SOD active site as compared to the Cu,Zn b-SOD occurs at residue atoms are Asp81, whose carboxylat? group displaced from 0.49 to 1.34 A. Despite this, the coordination bond is maintained within a distance of 1.99 and 1.96 B in the two subunits, which is in a good agreement with values in the literature. On the other hand, it is fairly difficult to explain the substantially different backbone conformation observed for Asp81 in the two proteins. As a general conclusion, it can be stated that t,he substitution of Co(H) for the native Zn(I1) does not bring about strong perturbations in the active-site
