The thioredoxin (Trx) from Bacillus acidocaldarius (BacTrx), an eubacterium growing optimally at 333 K, is the first Trx described to date from a moderate thermophilic source. To understand the molecular basis of its thermostability, the three-dimensional structure in the oxidized form was determined by NMR methods. A total of 2276 1H-NMR derived distance constraints along with 23 hydrogen-bonds, 72 f and 27 x1 torsion angle restraints, were used in a protocol employing simulated annealing followed by restrained molecular dynamics and restrained energy minimization. BacTrx consists of a well-defined core region of five strands of b-sheet, surrounded by four exposed a-helices, features shared by other members of the thioredoxin family. The BacTrx 3D structure was compared with the Escherichia coli Trx (EcTrx) determined by X-ray crystallographic diffraction, and a number of structural differences were observed that may contribute to its thermostabilty. The results of structural analysis indicated that protein stability is due to cumulative effects, the main factor being an increased number of ionic interactions cross-linking different secondary structural elements and clamping the C-terminal a-helix to the core of the protein. Keywords: solution structure; electrostatic interaction; NMR spectroscopy; thermostability; thioredoxin.

In the last two decades, an increasing number of studies have focussed on the structural and functional characterization of proteins isolated from moderate or extreme thermophilic sources [1,2]. The comparative analysis of homologous proteins obtained from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms have proved useful in investigating the molecular basis of protein thermal-stability [3±6]. In addition to better understanding protein structure stabilization overall, this investigation may aid in the search for biotechnological applications using enzymes functional at high temperature. Many stabilizing features (i.e. additional salt-bridges and/or hydrogen bonds, maximization of packing, shorter loops, stabilizing substitution in a-helices, etc.) were identified by comparing enzyme structures from mesophilic and thermophilic sources. These studies have not yet produced a general rule, however, as each protein has

proved to be stabilized by a specific combination of factors [1,2]. Recently, a novel thioredoxin was isolated from the moderate thermophile Bacillus acidocaldarius [7]. Thioredoxins are small disulfide-containing redox proteins, typically with a molecular mass of 10±12 kDa and an acidic pI. They belong to an ubiquitous protein family and have been found in many different organisms (eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells) [8±10]. Thioredoxins are involved in a large number of functions in various fundamental cellular processes such as deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis [11], regulation of photosynthetic events [12], regeneration of oxidative damage [13], and activation of transcription factors [14]. Interestingly, the majority of these functions is related to the redox chemistry of a pair of cysteine residues which can undergo reversible oxidation-reduction by shuttling between a dithiol and a disulfide form in the catalytic process. To date, there are over 200 known primary sequences of different forms of thioredoxins, and their length varies from 105 to 110 amino acids. In spite of a large variation in aminoacid sequence (26±69% sequence identity), the pattern of cysteine placement in the primary structures is conserved. Moreover, all members of this protein family, for which a three-dimensional structure has been determined, have a common fold, the so-called thioredoxin motif [15,16] consisting of a central stranded b-sheet flanked by a-helices and a catalytic disulfide bond with the sequence Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys. The recombinant BacTrx was previously expressed and purified from Escherichia coli [7] in order to perform a characterization of its conformational stability and to determine the three-dimensional structure. The protein is composed of 105 residues, with a molecular mass of 11 577 Da, and shows a 49% sequence identity with the E. coli thioredoxin which was widely studied [17±19]. Despite their similar primary structures,

The sequential dNN(i,i+1) connectivities in the a1 helix (Ala8±Ile14) and a4 helix (Lys93±Gln105), as well as long-range dNN connectivities among the five strands of the central b-sheet, are shown.

the stability of BacTrx and EcTrx are quite distinct [7]. Using circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to monitor the unfolding process, it was found that BacTrx shows a denaturation temperature (376 K) 158 higher than EcTrx, which is itself a remarkably stable molecule. As an initial step, BacTrx was characterized by means of spectroscopic techniques (fluorescence, CD), as well as calorimetry and nanogravimetry. In addition, in order to suggest possible structural determinants of stability, homology modeling [7] and molecular dynamics simulations [20] were performed. Four mutants with decreased stability were designed based on these results [21]. Their relative stability in comparison with the wild-type protein was then assessed as a function of temperature and chaotropic agents, using spectropolarimetric measurements. Here, we describe the solution structure of the oxidized state of BacTrx determined by homonuclear NMR spectroscopy. The final set of 20 BacTrx structures, obtained from the simulated annealing and based on experimental NMR restraints, reveals the degree of conservation of the global folding within the Trx family. The molecular features are compared with the homologue mesophilic counterpart from E. coli, in order to identify the stabilizing factors responsible for its thermostability.

grown at a D600 cell density of 1, and induced for 18 h with 1 mm isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside, the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity by means of two successive heat treatments (at 353 K for 20 min), an anion-exchange chromatography and a gel-filtration chromatography performed as described by Bartolucci et al. [7]. The protein yield from 1 L of culture was 20 mg. The oxidation state was tested by tryptophanyl fluorescence intensity at 350 nm upon excitation at 295 nm [7,22]. NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra were acquired on < 1.2 mm BacTrx samples (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 5.8) either in a mixture of 90% H2O/10% 2H2O, or 99.99% 2H2O after complete exchange of all labile protons. All NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz on a Varian Unity 600 spectrometer equipped with a tripleresonance probe. Solvent suppression was achieved by low-power irradiation (presaturation time 0.5 s) during the relaxation delays (1.5 s). All measurements were carried out at 300 and 308 K. All 2D spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation using the felix_nd data processing package (MSI, Molecular Simulation, San Diego, CA, USA), and the 3D spectrum was processed using Varian vnmrs software. In order to determine the proton resonances, the following spectra were recorded both in H2O and 2H2O solution: double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) [23,24], clean-total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) (spin lock 50, and 80 ms) [25,26], multiple quantum filtered-correlated spectroscopy (MQF) [27], nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy

COSY) [31] in 2 H2O. Spectral width was 9200 Hz, both in 2H2O and H2O. Typical acquisition consisted of 512 t1 increments (64 scans per increment) with 2048 complex points in t2. The 3D spectrum was acquired with 128, 90, and 512 real points in t1, t2, and t3, respectively. Quadrature detection was achieved using hypercomplex data acquisition [32]. The data were zero-filled and Fourier transformed to yield a 4096 (F1) Â 2048 (F2) real data point matrix. The final 3D data matrix, after linear prediction and zero filling, contained 256, 256 and 4096 points in F1, F2, and F3, respectively. Amide proton exchange was followed by recording a series of 1D-1H and TOCSY spectra at 308 K immediately after the lyophilized protein was dissolved in 2H2O and every 30 min during the first 24 h following the preparation of the sample. The sample was then heated to 328 K for 6 h, replacing all backbone amide protons with deuterions. Resonance assignment The sequence-specific resonance assignments of BacTrx thioredoxin was achieved according to a well-established

procedure [33]. The combined analysis of the fingerprint regions of the TOCSY, COSY, WATERGATE-TOCSY, and WATERGATE-COSY spectra, recorded in H2O at 300 and 308 K, revealed all the NH-CaH cross-peaks expected. From the amide protons and TOCSY connectivities combined with NOESY, DQ-2D and DQF-COSY spectra, we could unambiguously identify all the spin systems. A DQ-2D and 3D NOESY-TOCSY were also used to confirm the assignments. The sequential connectivities were obtained from NOESY and WATERGATE-NOESY spectra recorded with mixing times of 100 and 150 ms. A region of NOESY spectrum showing NH-NH NOE connectivities is presented in Fig. 1. Experimental constraints Distance constraints were obtained by measuring the intensity of the NOE cross peaks in the spectrum recorded with a mixing time of 100 ms at 308 K. To relate these NOE data with intramolecular interproton distances, a calibration was made using well defined geminal Hb-Hb. NOEs were classified as strong, medium or weak, corresponding to interproton distance restraints of 0.18±0.30 nm, 0.18±0.40 nm and 0.18±0.50 nm, respectively. Upper distance restraints involving nonstereospecifically assigned methylene, aromatic, and methyl protons were replaced by appropriate pseudoatoms. Lower bounds were taken to be the sum of the van der Waals radii for the interacting protons in all cases.

Large (. 9 Hz) and small (, 6 Hz) values of the estimated 3JNH-aH coupling constants are indicated as O and P, respectively. The daa connectivity between Ile72 and cisPro73 is shown as *.

Hydrogen bonds, established by slowly exchanging amide protons and proximity in preliminary 3D structures, were introduced during the structure refinement using an allowed distance range of 0.16±0.25 nm for proton-oxygen distances and 0.22±0.3 nm for amide nitrogen-oxygen distances. A number of 72 f angle restraints were derived from the 3 JNH-Ha coupling constants using the Karplus relation [34]. f Angle restraints were added with errors of ^ 308. The 27 x1 angle restraints were obtained from the analysis of the sidechain coupling constants 3JHa-Hb and intraresidue NOEs. The limits of the intervals were set to a single rotamer (608 ^ 608, 1808 ^ 608, 2608 ^ 608). Stereospecific assignments were obtained for a total of 23 nondegenerate pairs of diastereotopic b-methylene protons, and for 3 g-methyls of valine. NH-CaH coupling constants were estimated in the DQF-COSY spectra from measurements of extrema separations in dispersive and absorptive plots of rows through cross peaks [35]. In this experiment, the digital resolution after zero-filling along v2 (F2) was 0.43 Hz per point. CaH-CbH coupling constants were determined from the E. COSY spectrum recorded in 2H2O with

a digital resolution of 0.31 Hz per point along v2 (F2). Coupling constants and stereospecific assignments of the resonances of prochiral CbH protons were obtained using several different 2D spectra. DQF-COSY was used together with the information from E. COSY spectra to obtain values for the 3JHa-Hb coupling constants. Complementary evidence for the stereospecific assignments was in most cases obtained from intraresidue NOE connectivities between NH, CaH and CbH.

Structure calculations and analysis Structures were computed using the simulated annealing method [36] in the NMR-Refine module of the insight II package (MSI Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA, USA). An iterative approach to the structure calculations was used by carrying out a series of cycles with additional restraints incorporated at each successive stage. The hydrogen-bonding restraints were deduced on the basis of slowly exchanging NH protons and the pattern of sequential and interstrand NOEs

residues) NOE connectivities obtained from the NMR data set recorded on BacTrx. The figure also provides qualitative NH exchange and 3JNH-Ha coupling constants. Structure calculations From the final set of experimental restraints, a total of 50 structures were calculated, 46 of which were energy-minimized using the program discover. Four structures were rejected because of the presence of misfolds. After minimization, 20 structures satisfied the criteria of no systematic residual distance violations greater than 0.05 nm and dihedral violations more than 58. Hence, these structures were used to define the BacTrx tertiary structure. A superimposition of the 20 selected structures is displayed in Fig. 4. The excluded structures were found to have no systematic violations within 0.07 nm. Description of the BacTrx structure The 20 selected structures were superimposed on the mean structure (residues 2±105) with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C) of 0.085 nm. The structural statistics for the ensemble are presented in Table 1. A more detailed assessment of the local variability of backbone positions is provided by the histogram of the rmsd of the backbone nuclei (N, Ca, C) per residue relative to the average structure of the ensemble, as shown in Fig. 2B. A comparison with the plot of the NOEs vs. sequence number, presented in Fig. 2A, clearly shows an inverse correlation with the experimental distance constraints. For the majority of the residues, the average rmsd from the average structure is below 0.075 nm. Another measure of the precision of the ensemble of BacTrx structures is the angular order parameter [42,43], S 2 angular , of the Ca(i)-Ca(i + 1) vector across the assembly of structures (Fig. 2C). Precisely determined positions are characterized by S2 angular values near unity. The analysis of the Ramachandran plot [44] shows that 90% of the residues lies in most favoured regions and 8% in the additional allowed regions, as defined by the program procheck. Details of quality and precision estimates of the solution structures are also summarized in Table 1. Not surprisingly, the overall protein fold determined for BacTrx is very similar to that of the other known thioredoxins [15,16]. The characteristic core consisting of a five stranded b-sheet surrounded by four a-helices is preserved. Secondary structure The analysis of (f, c) distribution, H-bonds patterns and characteristic NOE connectivities made it possible to identify the boundaries of the secondary structural elements: b-strands (involving residues 2±5, 20±25, 50±56, 74±78, 83±88); a-helices (residues 7±15, 30±45, 62±67, 93±105); 310 helix or turn (residues 57±59). The sequential arrangement of the secondary structural elements shows the typical pattern b1a1b2a2b3a3b4b5a4: both first and second strands run parallel to the third, whereas b4 is antiparallel to b2 and b5 strands. As expected, the b-sheet has a right-handed twist, defined in terms of the hydrogen-bonding direction [45]. The residues that participate in the b-sheet are well defined, with ,rmsd.2±5,20±25,50±56,74±78,83±88 = 0.04 nm for the backbone. An ,rmsd.7±15,30±45,62±67,93±105 = 0.066 nm was calculated for the backbone atoms of a-helices. Turns By the analysis of the ensemble of final structures, four turns were identified by the standard criteria that the Ca(i) is less than

involving the NH and CaH protons. These were only introduced after the initial set of structure calculations. Final minimizations were performed with full consistent valence force field (CVFF) (Morse and Lennard±Jones potentials, Coulombic term), to a maximum derivative of Ê 0.001 kcal´A21. The BacTrx ensemble was inspected by the program insightii and analysed by prochecknmr (v. 3.4.4) [37,38] and whatif [39]. The analysis of stabilizing factors was performed on all the minimized structures. The comparison was made with the EcTrx crystallographic structure [18], PDB code number 2TRX (molecule A). Ion±pair interactions were identified using the criterion of a distance # 0.4 nm between charged groups [40], taking into account the motional averaging of solvent exposed polar side-chain orientations, which is reflected by values of 1 and 2 circular variances. The dssp program was used to compare hydrogen bonding patterns and regular secondary structure elements, as well as for calculations of the solvent accessible surface area [41]. H-bonds were also checked using the measure H-bond facility of insight II. The angular order parameter S 2 angular was computed over the final ensemble using the nmrrefine module of the insight II package.

Experimental constraints After generating several initial sets of structures and re-evaluating NOE assignments, a final set of restraints was assembled for BacTrx and, after elimination of the redundant constraints, consisted of 2276 interproton distances, 72 f and 27 x1 dihedral angles. Among these distance constraints, 705 were intraresidue, 541 sequential (|i ± j| = 1), 409 short-range (1 , |i ± j| , 5), and 621 long-range (|i ± j| . 5) NOEs.

0.7 nm from Ca(i, i + 3) and that the residues at positions i + 1 and i + 2 are not helical [45]. The residues comprised in the first turn (Gly 16±Pro 19) showed a low number of NOEs and low order parameter values consistent with the high rmsd in this region (,rmsd.17±18 = 0.1 nm) (Fig. 2B). The average f, c angles for Asp17 and Lys18 classified this turn as arbE type using the Ramachandran nomenclature [46]; this is equivalent to a distorted type VIII b-turn. Turn II consists of residues Ala26±Cys29 and was evaluated as a arar type turn. These residues are well ordered (,rmsd.26±29 = 0.06 nm). A third turn, His46±Lys49 (,rmsd.46±49 = 0.08 nm) may be classified as a :ar type turn (II H distorted). The fourth (Lys79± Arg82), a argl type turn, was poorly defined in terms of average backbone rmsd (,rmsd.79±82 = 0.1 nm). Active-site The active-site loop extends from Ala26, at the end of the b2 strand, to Cys32 at the end of the first turn of the a2 helix, encompassing the two cysteines at positions 29 and 32. The local rmsd for 29±32 backbone atoms is 0.04 ^ 0.01 nm and

the Ca-Ca distance between the cysteines 0.53 ^ 0.02 nm. The 29±32 disulfide side chains have the following values of dihedral angles: x1 = 150 ^ 108 and x2 = ± 146 ^ 58 for Cys29, x1 H = ± 52 ^ 58 and x2 H = 82 ^ 38 for Cys32 and x3 = 76 ^ 28 for the S±S bond. The S±S bridge has a unique right-handed conformation similar to those observed in other oxidized thioredoxins and protein disulfide oxidoreductases [9].

DISCUSSION
Comparison with the EcTrx structure and analysis of stabilizing factors Global folding. A qualitative inspection of the structures indicates that the BacTrx overall fold is very similar to that of EcTrx derived by X-ray (Fig. 5A) and only small differences in the molecular architecture can be observed. The superposition of all the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C) (residues 5±104) of the 20 final BacTrx structures onto the E. coli crystal structure yields an average rmsd of 0.14 nm, while the rmsd is reduced to 0.12 nm if the secondary structure elements are

compared. This indicates that major local differences occur at the intrinsically disordered regions connecting regular structures. The superimposition of all the backbone atoms of the b-structures gives an rmsd of 0.089 ^ 0.005 nm (residues: 2±5, 20±25, 50±56, 74±78, 83±88). It is interesting to note that although for individual helices the rmsd varies in a range of 0.043±0.054 nm, for the helix ensemble (7±15, 30±45, 62±67, 93±105) the value increases to 0.137 ^ 0.002 nm. This indicates that despite the fact that the molecular topology is globally similar and an excellent superimposition was obtained for the central b sheet (Fig. 5B), differences could be observed in the packing of helices around the hydrophobic core (Fig. 5C). Among the highly conserved residues, the maintenance of hydrogen bond pattern and side chain conformations is especially significant. In particular, this can be observed for the residues of the active site (Cys29-Cys32). They are in contact with two loops (Met70±Pro73, Leu87±Tyr90), which together with the active-site residues form a hydrophobic surface thought to be important in binding to substrate proteins [8±10]. Most of these residues are conserved in the Trx family and have a structural counterpart in BacTrx, suggesting the preservation of the catalytic mechanism. Similar to the other conserved residues, the aromatic rings, forming a hydrophobic cluster buried in the protein core, appear to be oriented in a similar direction and have almost identical side-chain conformations in BacTrx and EcTrx. The structural similarity observed for the main-chain was expected on the basis of both the high structural homology found within the Trx family [7,15] and the high sequence identity (49%) between BacTrx and EcTrx. This occurrence is also reflected by the great similarity of BacTrx main-chain 1H chemical shifts with EcTrx [17]. In the region Leu21-Glu41 with the highest primary sequence homology, most of the proton resonances of BacTrx are within 0.5 p.p.m. of the corresponding proton chemical shifts in EcTrx. Exceptions with |dBacTrx ± dEcTrx| . 0.5 p.p.m. are clustered around the positions of the amino acid substitutions. Because the oxidized E. coli thioredoxin in solution [19] is largely indistinguishable from the crystal structure (molecule A), the superimposition of the backbone atoms (residues 5±104) of BacTrx onto the EcTrx solution structures yields an average rmsd (0.13 nm) which is close to the deviation from the X-ray structure. The comparison with other thioredoxins (Table 2), such as thioredoxin-2 from a cyanobacterium of the Anabaena genus [47], thioredoxin h from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [48] and human thioredoxin [49], showed that BacTrx models are closer to bacterial and cyanobacterial thioredoxins than to eukaryotic ones. As also pointed out by Mittard et al. [48], the superimposition of thioredoxins from different sources clearly reflects their phylogenetic relationship. Secondary structures. In spite of a general preservation of the three-dimensional structure and catalytic mechanism, previous comparative studies on mesophilic and thermophilic proteins showed several cases of changes in the secondary structure [1,2]. The secondary structure analysis, as performed on BacTrx and EcTrx structures by means of the program DSSP, revealed no appreciable differences in the content of a and b structures between the proteins, with the exception of the first helix which, in BacTrx, is longer at the N-terminus because of the replacement of two residues in turn conformation in EcTrx. In addition, in BacTrx a mechanism of a-helix stabilization is observed in two cases: the negatively charged residues Asp15

and Glu48, located in EcTrx at the C-terminus of the a1 and a2 helices, respectively, are replaced by Gln12 and Ala45 (numbering of the amino-acid sequence is for BacTrx), thus eliminating unfavourable interactions with the helix-dipole moment [50]. Moreover, even if no reduction in the size of flexible regions was observed compared to EcTrx, two proline (Pro19, Pro92) residues are present in BacTrx loops (16±20, 89±92) leading to a local reduction of the mobility degree.

Packing. From the analysis of the BacTrx structure, a tighter interaction among different secondary structural elements has emerged compared to EcTrx. This can be quantitatively appreciated by the average Ca-Ca distance between the C- and N-terminal residues of the a4 helix to the N terminal regions of the b2 and b3 strands (Leu104 Ca±Pro19 Ca = 0.665 nm vs. 0.759 nm in EcTrx, Leu104 Ca ±Val52 Ca = 1.199 nm vs. 1.354 nm, Leu104 Ca ±Lys49 Ca = 0.678 nm vs. 0.842 nm) and the C±terminus of the b5 strand (Gln95 Ca ±Leu87 Ca = 0.988 nm vs. 1.038 nm in EcTrx), respectively. All of these findings are associated with a different axis orientation of the a4 helix and indicate its closer packing to the core of the protein relative to the crystal structure of EcTrx. On the other hand, the a2 helix proved to be more distant from the central sheet of the protein (Asp23 Ca ±Ala36 Ca = 1.053 nm vs. 0.914 nm; Ala36 Ca ±Lys54 Ca = 1.153 nm vs. 0.987 nm; Asp23 Ca ±Leu39 Ca = 0.912 nm vs. 0.872; Leu39 Ca ±Lys54 Ca = 1.077 nm vs. 0.980 nm). However, the Ca ±Ca distances among the triad Cys32, Pro73 and Gly89 suggest that the binding surface topology is maintained (Cys32 Ca ±Pro73 Ca = 0.537 nm vs. 0.522 nm in EcTrx; Cys32 Ca ±Gly89 Ca = 0.803 nm vs. 0.827 nm; Pro73 Ca ± Gly89 Ca = 0.55 nm vs. 0.525 nm). The local conformational rearrangements of the secondary structural elements occur without any major changes in the backbone fold. In addition, the solvent accessible surface area calculations showed only subtle differences between the two proteins. Nevertheless, it should be noted that there is an increase of < 50% in the solvent accessibility of the partially shielded Trp25 compared to Trp28 of EcTrx. This feature is due to Ala27 in place of Glu30 of EcTrx, whose longer side-chain more effectively shields Trp28. The major exposure of Trp25 readily explains the fluorescence data showing a red shift of the emission maximum of the tryptophans in the oxidized BacTrx (lmax 350 nm) [7] compared to EcTrx (lmax 341 nm) [22]. The tryptophan fluorescence therefore turns out to be less sensitive as a spectral probe in monitoring BacTrx unfolding. Ion-pairs. The salt-bridges play a key role in the stabilization of BacTrx. A total number of 0.09 ion-pairs per residue was found in BacTrx compared to 0.05 in EcTrx which is close to the mean value in mesophilic proteins (0.04) (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that the extra-ion pairs in BacTrx derive from amino acid substitutions and not from different

local orientations of preserved side chains. All the ionic interactions are localized on the protein surface with the exception of Asp23(Od)±Lys54(Nz) which is buried and Glu97(O:)±His46(N:), which is partially buried. It has been pointed out that buried ion-pairs are rarely represented in proteins (only 16%). When present, they assume a specific functional or structural role. Most of the observed salt-bridges occur between residues that are distant in the sequence and link different secondary structural elements (Fig. 6). This suggest that they contribute to the stability of the protein, acting to stabilize the tertiary rather than the secondary structure. Indeed, the C-terminal helix is clamped to the rest of the BacTrx core by three salt bridges

[Glu41(O:)±Lys93(Nz), Glu97(O:)±His46(N:) Asp102(Od)± Lys85(Nz)] connecting helix a4 to a2 and b5 (Fig. 6A). At the same time, the ion pair between Lys93(Nz) and Glu97(O:), both engaged in bi-dentate interactions, leads to an extended ionic network. Moreover, it should be noted that the salt bridges Asp23(Od)±Lys54(Nz), Asp102(Od)±Lys85(Nz) and Glu41(O:)±Lys93(Nz) are strengthened by hydrogen bonds, thus forming hydrogen-bonded ion pairs [51,52]. Experimental proofs of the role of ion interactions were derived from the decreased stability observed for the single mutant Lys18Gly, the double mutant Lys18Gly/Arg82Glu and the truncated form Asp102X lacking the last four C-terminal residues [21]. Considering the structural determination, the destabilizing effects of Lys18Gly derive from the substitution of the positively charged Lys18, whose side±chain (Nz) is involved in electrostatic interactions with Asp48(Od) and/or Asp17(Od) (Fig. 6B), while for the mutant Arg82Glu, it is due to the lack of the side-chain/main-chain H-bond Arg82(H:)± Pro83(CO), also supported by slow exchange data. In the case of Asp102X, the deletion of the C-terminal tail deprives the molecule of the ion-pair due to residue 102 and introduces a local perturbation affecting the last helix conformation and the interacting regions (Fig. 6A). It could be assumed that the C-terminal helix plays a protective role on the whole molecule because of the multiple ionic interactions with residues located in the protein core. Simulation in water [20] confirmed the importance of the last helical segment in holding in place the overall fold and in protecting the hydrophobic core. The strategic positioning of these multiple ionic interactions in the context of the overall protein structure may help to prevent `fraying' of the C-terminus which has been proposed recently as the initiation of thermal denaturation [5]. The importance of intramolecular electrostatic interactions is also supported by changes observed in the CD spectrum of BacTrx at pH values , 5 and . 9 (data not shown), unlike EcTrx which appears essentially unchanged in the range 2.5±11.5, in agreement with previous NMR studies on pH denaturation [53]. The pH dependence may well be accounted for by the disruption of the ion-pairs observed in BacTrx, as the state of ionization of side-chains evidently controls the ability to pair. Hydrogen bonds. Both proteins exhibit nearly identical patterns and all the hydrogen bonds defining the secondary structural elements, observed in the EcTrx crystal structure, are also found in the BacTrx solution structures, even though no distance constraints for such interactions were introduced in the earlier structure calculations. These hydrogen bonds adequately explain the very slow exchange of 41 NH groups. Although slight changes between the BacTrx and EcTrx structures are present in the distribution of H-bonds involving side chains, mainly due to amino acid replacement, the total number of H-bonds does not differ significantly, revealing no clear correlation to thermostability. As mentioned above, however, a significant feature is the presence of some side-chain/ side-chain H-bonds [Asp23(Od)±Lys54(Nz), Asp102(Od)± Lys85(Nz), Glu41(O:)±Lys93(Nz)] that contribute to the last helix stabilization and/or enforce salt-bridges.

[8±10,15,16,47±49]. This work represents the first structure of a thermostable thioredoxin and complements earlier structural studies carried out on this family of proteins. In addition, it provides a further opportunity to investigate the mechanisms of protein stabilization assuming EcTrx as a suitable reference model for BacTrx. At an earlier stage of our conformational analysis, the crystal structures of EcTrx [18] and AnaTrx (strain 7120) [47] were used to model the three-dimensional structure of BacTrx [7]. Comparing the predicted structure with the present NMR structure, an rmsd of 0.12 nm (for all the backbone atoms) was calculated. The homology model did correctly propose a molecule stabilized by an increased number of long-range electrostatic interactions, which was widely held to promote thermostability in proteins [56±65]. Indeed, a large number of extra ion pairs, three of which comprise hydrogen bonds, was found in BacTrx, and their main effect appears to be the stabilization of the tertiary structure. The comparison to EcTrx reveals that a network of hydrogenbonded ion pairs together with a closer packing of the a4 helix causes the rigidity of the BacTrx C-terminal region. It is noteworthy that the protein N-terminus also proves to be better stabilized because it is shorter, lacking the two amino acids which show high temperature factors in the X-ray structure and are disordered in the NMR family of EcTrx [19]. Finally, two additional structural features were noted: the stabilization of a1 and a2 macrodipole due to the removal of helix destabilizing residues, and the strategic placement of two proline residues in loops which locally reduce the flexibility of the protein, thus increasing its compactness. The work presented here indicates that the increased thermostability of BacTrx is achieved by various improvements at many locations within the protein. The major determinant of stability may be found in extended electrostatic interactions which, along with further fine structural differences, lead to a more rigid structure.

CONCLUSIONS
In view of its numerous functions involving the active site [8±10,54], thioredoxin has elicited intense structural studies: since the first 3D structure was obtained in 1975 by X-ray crystallography [55], several structural investigations on thioredoxins from different sources were reported
