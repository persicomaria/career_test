The 3D-solution structure of Neurospora crassa Cu6-metallothionein (NcMT) polypeptide backbone was determined using homonuclear, multidimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy. It represents a new metallothionein (MT) fold with a protein chain where the N-terminal half is left-handed and the C-terminal half right-handedly folded around a copper(I)-sulfur cluster. As seen with other MTs, the protein lacks definable secondary structural elements; however, the polypeptide fold is unique. The metal coordination and the cysteine spacing defines this unique fold. NcMT is only the second MT in the copper-bound form to be structurally characterized and the first containing the -CxCxxxxxCxCmotif. This motif is found in a variety of mammalian MTs and metalloregulatory proteins. The in vitro formation of the Cu6NcMT identical to the native Cu6NcMT was dependent upon the prior formation of the Zn3NcMT and its titration

with Cu(I). The enhanced sensitivity and resolution of the 800 MHz 1H-NMR spectral data permitted the 3D structure determination of the polypeptide backbone without the substitution and utilization of the NMR active spin 1/2 metals such as 113Cd and 109Ag. These restraints have been necessary to establish specific metal to cysteine restraints in 3D structural studies on this family of proteins when using lower field, less sensitive 1H-NMR spectral data. The accuracy of the structure calculated without these constraints is, however, supported by the similarities of the 800 MHz structures of the a-domain of mouse MT1 compared to the one recalculated without metal≠cysteine connectivities. Keywords: copper; metallothionein; Neurospora crassa; NMR; solution structure.

Metallothioneins (MTs) are a ubiquitous class of proteins occurring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes [1]. MTs are known for their small size (< 7 kDa), the ability to coordinate a diverse range of metals, a lack of definable secondary structure, high cysteine content ( 30%), and degeneracy in the remaining residues (e.g. predominance of cysteine, serine, lysine and no aromatic residues). The high cysteine content and their spacing give the MTs a high affinity for metals (e.g. Ka of Zn≠MT  1 ∑ 1012 M) [2,3]. While an essential physiological role has yet to be ascribed

to MT, there is no question that MTs are involved in the protection of cells against metal intoxication through the sequestration of the excess essential metal ions like copper and zinc, as well as nonessential metal ions, like cadmium, mercury and silver [4]. Although the essential metals have critical structural, catalytic and regulatory roles in proteins, their cellular concentration must be carefully maintained through the use of pumps and sequestering peptides and proteins to avoid toxic effects. Despite the high affinity for metals, MTs are also postulated to participate in an undetermined mechanism of facile metal exchange (i.e. kinetically labile yet thermodynamically stable) with other proteins possessing substantially lower metal affinities [5≠8]. Since the MTs have little or no repetitive secondary structure, their tertiary structure is dependent on the number and type of metal ions they coordinate. The MT from the fungus Neurospora crassa, is a single domain MT made up of 25 residues, seven of which are cysteine residues [9]. This small peptide coordinates six Cu(I) atoms via the seven cysteinyl sulfurs [10]. N. crassa metallothionein (NcMT) binds copper in a solvent-shielded environment, which produces a luminescent core [11]. In vivo, the NcMT is induced only by copper; other transition metals (zinc, cadmium, cobalt, and nickel) do not induce transcription of NcMT mRNA although the protein will bind these metal ions in vitro [12,13]. The in vitro metal ion binding characteristics of NcMT mimic that of the mammalian b-domain, i.e. NcMT binds zinc(II), cadmium(II) and cobalt(II) with a 3 : 1 metal to

that contain the -CxCxxxxCxC- and -CxCxxxxxCxCmotifs, Fig. 1. The 1H NMR resonance assignments for the Cu6NcMT purified from N. crassa have been reported [27] and these were used as a template to compare and confirm a similar overall fold for the in vitro reconstituted, synthesized protein used in this study. We report here the 3D NMR solution structure of the Cu6NcMT, obtained without establishing any metal≠cysteine restraints, and discuss the formation of the Zn3NcMT precursor molecule that was needed to obtain the Cu6NcMT structure.

Materials and methods
Proteins and peptides The NcMT was synthesized chemically to avoid its problematic induction and purification. As noted previously by another group [28], N. crassa can use several or a mixture of copper resistance mechanisms to detoxify excess copper. In initial attempts, we found that exposure to copper did not consistently result in the induction of MT. Therefore, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the NcMT was synthesized using Boc-Pam resin and Boc-chemistry protocols [29]. The peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin using anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride, para-cresol and para-thiocresol (269≠271 K for 70 min). Purification included a diethyl ether wash under a nitrogen atmosphere and preparative trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/acetonitrile [buffer A: 0.1% (v/v) TFA/water; buffer B 90% acetonitrile/10% water and 0.1% TFA, v/v/v) linear gradient HPLC (0≠50% buffer B over 40 min) on a reverse phase HPLC column (Waters Delta-Pak PrepPak C18; 40 mm ∑ 100 mm). Elution was monitored at 214 nm, and the eluted peptide was freeze-dried for storage. Subsequent analysis showed that the peptide was oxidized by the cleavage/purification treatment, therefore the peptide was reduced by suspension in 6 M guanidine/HCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, and 150 mM dithiothreitol with incubation at 42 ∞C for 2 h. The reduced protein sample was then loaded onto a G25 (Pharmacia) size exclusion column (200 mm ∑ 15 mm) previously equilibrated with 0.2% (v/v) TFA. The protein fraction was collected, pooled and sealed anaerobically. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis and the reduction state of the sulfhydryls confirmed by dithiodipyridine assay [30]. All subsequent manipulations of the apo- and metallated NcMT were performed under anaerobic conditions, 5% H2 and 95% N2 (v/v), in a glove box (Atomspure Protector Glove Box, Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). Metal titrations Copper(I) titrations were performed as described by Byrd et al. [31]. Protein samples with reduction state > 95% were used for all titrations. Sequential additions of copper(I), as [Cu(CH3CN)4]ClO4 in 200 mM ammonium acetate pH 7.9, were made to the apo-NcMT. Identical titrations were performed with Zn(II)3NcMT instead of the apo-NcMT. The Zn3NcMT was prepared from apo-NcMT by adding 3.5 molar equivalents of Zn(II) (added as Zn(II)acetate) in a 10-fold excess of free cysteine to stabilize the

protein stoichiometry and Cu(I) with a 6 : 1 stoichiometry [12]. The NcMT cysteine arrangement is identical to the first seven amino-terminal cysteines of the b-domain of human MT (Fig. 1), though the human MT has two additional cysteines in this domain. Similar cysteine spacing is seen in the metal binding motifs of the metalloregulatory proteins from Enterococcus hirae (CopY), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ace1 and Mac1) and Candida albicans (AMT1) though these proteins do not share any other significant homology, Fig. 1. Along with the metal coordination number, the positioning of the cysteines in the primary structure has been determined to be the critical factor in determining the global fold of the MTs [14]. The structures of several MT isoforms have been determined including that from yeast [15,16], crab [17], sea urchin [14], an antarctic fish [18] and various mammals [19≠23]. With the exception of the yeast Cu7MT [16], the previous NMR solution structures of MTs, including yeast MT [15], all relied on the substitution of NMR active spin 1/2 metals such as 113Cd and 109Ag for the determination of specific metal≠cysteine restraints, which were included in the subsequent structure calculations [24]. While the mammalian copper(I) MTs have evaded 3D structural elucidation by NMR and X-ray crystallography [1], recent CD spectroscopic studies on the Cu(I) and Ag(I) substituted b-fragment of mouse MT1 have revealed structural differences that may reflect a different conformational fold for the Ag(I) substituted b-domain compared to the native Cu(I) containing fragment [25]. The only copper(I) MT structure determined has been that of the yeast MT which has a distinctly different cysteine arrangement, Fig. 1 [15,16]. However, disagreement exists in the comparison of this NMR derived structure of the yeast MT without the 13 C-terminal residues and the small angle X-ray scattering pattern of the full length protein which has been attributed to the core of the NMR structure being too compact [15,16,26]. The similarity in the metal binding properties and cysteine spacing in NcMT with mammalian MT makes it a candidate for the modelling of the Cu(I)≠sulfur cluster of the b-domain of mammalian Cu6MT and potentially useful for other copper(I)-regulated proteins

excess zinc. Prior to the copper(I) titration of the NcMT sample, it was treated with 50 lL of a 1 : 1 slurry of Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) in degassed MilliQ water to remove any excess unbound/displaced metals. The Chelex-100 was removed by centrifugation. The Cu(I)-thiolate emission was monitored at 580 nm (excitation at 295 nm) with a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer. The spectra were collected at 23 ∞C in sealed screw-topped fluorescence cuvettes (Spectrocell). The spectrometer was equipped with a 350 nm band-pass filter to avoid second order effects and used settings of 5 and 20 nm, respectively, for the excitation and emission slits. Cu(I)≠NcMT for NMR analysis was desalted on PD-10 (Pharmacia, G-25) columns equilibrated with MilliQ water, pooled and lyophilized. Copper stoichiometry was quantified by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. The final Cu6NcMT contained 1.8 lmol NcMT and 10.9 lmol Cu(I). NMR sample preparation Lyophilized Cu6NcMT (handled under an argon atmosphere) was dissolved in 500 lL 90% H2O, 10% D2O, pH 6.5, 0.1 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (as an internal reference) [32], and 0.02% NaN3 that was degassed prior to protein addition under high vacuum and re-pressurized to 1 atm under argon to avoid oxidation/ disproportionation of the Cu(I)≠protein. The sample was loaded into a 5 mm NMR tube, capped and sealed with parafilm. NMR spectroscopy and assignments of NcMT A 2D1H,1H-TOCSY [33,34] and 2D 1H,1H-NOESY were collected at 10 ∞C on a Varian Inova 800 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-axis gradient, tripleresonance probe. The sweep widths for both experiments were 9000 Hz with 1024 and 512 complex points collected in the directly and indirectly detected dimensions, respectively. The TOCSY was collected with 64 transients per increment (40 ms mixing time with 300 ms delay between acquisitions), and the NOESY was collected with 32 transients per increment (300 ms mixing period with 200 ms delay between acquisitions). Spectra were zerofilled to twice the number of collected points and apodized using a p/3 shifted sine bell before Fourier transformation. New 1H-chemical shift assignments at 10 ∞C from 2DNOESY and TOCSY spectra were performed as described previously [35]. All spectra were processed using NMRPIPE [36], and analysed using the program PIPP [37]. Coupling constants for backbone amide to a hydrogen atoms (i.e. 3 J HNHa) were obtained from 1D-proton and 2D-COSY spectra using deconvolution. Due to the different temperatures used during the NMR experiments (10 ∞C in the present study and 25 ∞C in [27]) there are expected to be small differences in chemical shifts, typically larger for NH protons. However, the overall very good agreement in these shifts can be confidently attributed to the protein forming the same structure. Gradient NOESY spectra were acquired with WaterGate solvent suppression taken from the ‘gnoesywg’ pulse sequence in ‘Protein Pack’ as supplied by Varian Inc.

Structure calculations for NcMT ∞ Distance restraints (50 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2) for NcMT structure ∞ calculations were classified as short (1.8≠2.7 A), medium ∞ ∞ (1.8≠3.3 A), and long (1.8≠5.0 A) based on their NOE intensities. The upper bound of an NOE restraint was ∞ extended by 0.5 A for each pseudoatom methylene, or methyl group. Residues exhibiting 3J HNHa coupling constants of < 5 Hz, 5≠8 Hz, 8≠9 Hz, and > 9 Hz were assigned dihedral angle restraints of )60∞ ± 30, )105∞ ± 55, ) 120∞ ± 40, and )120∞ ± 30, respectively, with a force constant of 500 kcal∆mol)1∆rad)1. No metal atoms were included in the structure calculation. Structures were calculated using X-PLOR 3.851 [38] on an Octane Power Desktop (SGI R12000 with IRIX 6.5) using the hybrid distance geometry-dynamical simulated annealing protocol [39] as described for mouse MT1 [23]. Out of the 30 calculated structures, 12 were selected based on the complete ∞ absence of NOE violations greater than 0.5 A and r.m.s.d. for bond and angle deviations from ideality of less than ∞ 0.01 A and 5∞, respectively. Structure calculations for mouse aMT All structure calculations involving the a-domain of the mouse MT, aMT-1, were performed as previously reported [23] with the exception that the metal≠cysteine restraints were not used and therefore all metals were absent in the calculations. To determine the precision [how well the individual structures calculated with a limited set of longrange NOEs (dij, j > i + 4) compare to each other] and accuracy (the similarity of the calculated structures with a reduced set of long-range NOEs to the structure calculated with all NOEs) of the calculated structures, all 22 long-range NOEs were first removed and then, by a random selection process reintroduced one by one for the structure calculations. Thereby, for each number of long-range NOEs, 10 random selections of reintroduced long-range NOE sets were made and 10 structures calculated for each set, giving a total of 100 structures calculated for each point in Fig. 4.

Results
Metal binding stoichiometry of NcMT N. crassa can express MT in response to excessive concentrations of copper in the growth media. NcMT purified from the mycelium of the fungus contains 6 Cu(I) ions per mole of protein [9]. The copper(I) ions are bound to the cysteinyl sulfurs in a solvent-shielded Cu≠S core [40]. Direct titration of copper(I) into a synthesized apo-NcMT resulted in a 4-Cu(I)NcMT. This complex was luminescent, excitation at 295 nm led to an emission maximum at 580 nm, which is evidence for solvent protected Cu(I)-thiolates but the luminescence increased up to a plateau at 4 mole equivalents of Cu(I) per protein (Fig. 2A,B). The 4 : 1 stoichiometry conflicts with the known native species. Titrations with a variety of copper(I) sources, different types and concentrations of reductant, and with or without thermal treatments as used by Stillman and coworkers [41] to select stable forms of the rabbit CuMT all resulted in the formation of Cu4NcMT.

(C) Titrations of 50 nmol∆mL)1 Zn3NcMT with copper(I) to a stoichiometry of 6 Cu(I) per mole of protein. The sequential increase plotted in (D) reveals a plateau at six equivalents and that the quantum yield of relative luminescence per mole of protein is equal for the 4 and 6 Cu(I)-NcMT.

Cu4NcMT, prepared under any of these conditions, was very broad and in contrast to the well defined native Cu6NcMT 1H NMR spectrum [27]. The unresolved 1H NMR spectrum would be consistent with the sample containing a mixture of interconverting NcMT structures and/or structural instabilities. In an attempt to restrict the family of conformers formed during the copper(I) titrations, we first titrated zinc into the apo-protein to form a Zn3NcMT precursor. The excess zinc was removed by treatment of the sample with Chelex-100. The zinc stoichiometry of the resultant protein, 3-Zn(II):1 NcMT, was as expected from previous studies of NcMT and by analogy to the well studied b-domains of the mammalian MTs [12]. Sequential titration of the Zn3NcMT with Cu(I) salts as before yielded a luminescent core but in this case, the stoichiometry was 6 Cu(I):1 NcMT, Fig. 2C,D. Most importantly, the 1D 1H-NMR pattern for the Cu6NcMT is equivalent to the native Cu(I) proton spectrum [27]. Attempts to prepare the Ag(I) derivative of NcMT did not result in a stoichiometry of 6 metals per mole of protein. Attempts to displace all of the zinc from the Zn3NcMT by silver were unsuccessful and always resulted in the formation of a mixed metal species inappropriate for structural studies. The structure determination of Zn3NcMT was not pursued as to our knowledge there are no reports of this metal form from natural sources. Metal-cysteine restraints To explore the feasibility of determining an MT structure without metal≠cysteine restraints, the structure of the a-domain of mouse MT-1 without the experimentally determined 113Cd≠Cys restraints was re-calculated. Fig. 3 shows the backbone fold of the average energy minimized structures for the a-domain of mouse MT-1 with (dark strand) and without (light strand) the inclusion of experimentally determined 113Cd≠Cys restraints. The superimposed backbone structures are remarkably similar with ∞ an r.m.s.d. of 1.94 A over all backbone atoms. This value is

very similar to the r.m.s.d. comparison between the a-domain of mouse MT-1 and the a-domain of rat MT-2, ∞ 2.14 A [23], suggesting that accurate and precise MT structure determinations are possible without using metal to cysteine restraints providing one has a sufficient number of NOE constraints. The lack of regular secondary structure in MTs places an increased importance upon the long-range contacts for precision in structure calculations. This can be quantitatively evaluated by recalculating the mouse MT1 a-domain structure in the absence of all long-range NOE restraints and 113Cd≠Cys connectivities and then systematically and randomly reintroducing long-range NMR

restraints to determine the effect on the precision and accuracy of the generated structure. Figure 4A shows the r.m.s.d. of 10 sets of structures, generated as described in Materials and methods, to the average minimized structure, for each set of reintroduced long-range NOEs. Determining the deviation of the generated structure with a reduced number of NOEs from the published MT1 structure provides a measure of accuracy shown in Fig. 4B. As can be seen, the structure of MT1 without metal≠cysteine restraints is sufficiently well defined as long as 10≠15 longrange NOEs are used for the structure calculation and the ∞ backbone r.m.s.d. is kept below 2 A. NcMT structure Two-dimensional 1H,1H-TOCSY and NOESY NMR spectroscopy was used to assign the 1H resonances and provide interproton distance restraints, respectively, on NcMT. The chemical shifts of NcMT determined here at 10 ∞C are similar to those of a previous study performed at

25 ∞C [27]. Almost all the 1H chemical shifts were visible in the TOCSY with the exception of the side chain of Cys5 (assigned from the NOESY), and all resonances of Gly1 (not identified in either experiment). Assignment of Gly1 was not possible; this was most likely due to rapid exchange of the amide proton of Gly1 with the solvent, coupled with chemical shift overlap reported previously [27]. The chemical shifts have been deposited in the BMRB data bank under accession number 6290. Examination of the chemical shifts showed no indication of secondary structure [42,43]. Line widths of 1D-1H NMR resonances have been used as an efficient method for determining the aggregation state of a protein [44,45]. The average line width of NcMT amide resonances from the 1D-1H spectrum was determined to be 5.6 Hz. When six Cu(I) atoms are considered bound to NcMT, the correlation time (sc) and line width for the monomer are expected to be 2.6≠3.7 ns and  4.5≠6 Hz, respectively [34]. The observed line widths for the reconstituted Cu6NcMT are consistent with the sample being monomeric. A summary of the observed NOEs is presented in Fig. 5A. Inspection of the NOE patterns shows no evidence of regular secondary structure elements, which is in agreement with the information from the chemical shifts

and is typical for this family of proteins. The total number of intraresidue, sequential, medium, and long-range NOEs for each residue in the NcMT sequence is shown in Fig. 5B. The majority of critical long-range restraints involve the side chains of Ala8, Asn12, and Cys21. Despite the almost complete assignment of 1H resonances, the number of longrange contacts was low. Utilizing the 152 NOEs and 13 dihedral angle restraints, a total of 30 structures was generated using the program XPLOR 3.851 [38]. From these generated structures, 12 resulted in no NOE or dihedral angle violations and all showed the same backbone fold. Subsequently, the 10 accepted structures (no NOE violation ∞ > 0.5 A, an r.m.s.d. for bond deviations from ideality of ∞ less than 0.01 A and an r.m.s.d. for angle deviations from ideality of less than 5∞) with the lowest energy were selected which yielded a backbone r.m.s.d. to the average minimized ∞ structure of 0.79 A for the well-defined region (residues ∞ 5≠20) and 1.59 A for the entire length of the protein. The final family of 10 NcMT structures is shown in Fig. 6 with the N- and C-termini labelled and the cysteine sulfur atoms in the ‘closest to mean’ structure drawn as spheres. The structure of NcMT has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 1T2Y. The structural statistics for NcMT are presented in Table 1. The program PROCHECK-NMR [46] showed that > 90% of the ¯, w angles for the 10 structures fell into the core or allowed regions. Despite the complete absence of elements of regular secondary structure, which is a quite common situation for MTs, the backbone global fold of the 25-residue peptide is well defined if one excludes the N and C termini. It shows a new polypeptide structure with the backbone being wrapped around an empty space containing the copper≠ sulfur cluster, on going from the N to C terminus, in a left handed form for the first half of the molecule then in a right handed form for the second half. Such a mixed handedness of the peptide part around the metal≠cysteine cluster has so far been found only in the C-terminal domain of blue crab MT [17], whose overall fold is quite different from that of NcMT. While NcMT shares considerable sequence similarities and a conservative positioning of the seven cysteine residues with other members of the MT family of proteins, none of the other structurally characterized MTs show the same fold. This is reflected in the r.m.s.d. differences in cysteine residue positions (backbone heavy atoms and sulfur atoms) between NcMT and lobster [47], yeast [15,16], mouse

[23], blue crab [17], fish [18] and sea urchin [14] MTs as shown in Table 2. Such r.m.s.d. differences in cysteine positions are characteristic of unrelated MT structures. A good example to illustrate this point is the r.m.s.d. differences between the a- and b-domains of sea urchin ∞ MT of 4.98 A for the cysteine backbone heavy atoms and ∞ for the sulfur atoms.

Discussion
The solution structure of the Cu6NcMT, which was solved without the acquisition and inclusion of specific metal≠ cysteine NMR restraints, shows a novel polypeptide fold and represents only the second copper MT structure to be elucidated [15,16]. Although other MTs show a strong sequence similarity to NcMT (e.g. 32% with the b-domain of human MT2) the 3D structure of the polypeptide backbone is completely different. The unique fold of this CuMT is a clear demonstration that MT protein folds are largely determined by the constraints of metal≠sulfur connections and not the amino acid sequence. N. crassa MT has a -CxCxxxxxCxC- motif that is found in a variety of Cu(I) binding proteins (Fig. 1). The lack of repetitive secondary structures in the NcMT peptide backbone along with the unsuccessful efforts to prepare the isomorphic and homogeneous NMR active spin 1/2 Ag(I) derivative of the native Cu(I) NcMT were factors which had inhibited its structure elucidation. A hallmark of the MT structures is the dependence on the sequential position of the cysteine in the primary sequence, the identity of the coordinated metal and its coordination number [14,48]. The paper by Bertini et al. [16] was the first to show that the acquisition of NMR data at 800 MHz allows for the determination of MT structures without metal≠cysteine constraints. The comparative study on mouse MT1 at 800 MHz in this paper helps to validate these studies. The successful in vitro reconstitution of Zn3NcMT with six equivalents of Cu(I) indicated that the metal binding stoichiometry was the same as the b-domain of mammalian MT [12] even though NcMT lacks the two C-terminal cysteines found in the mammalian MTs. These two missing cysteines and therefore less metal coordination might be the reason why NcMT needs to be in the Zn3-form before it successfully binds six atoms of copper(I). Thus,

Zn3≠NcMT might constitute a scaffold where the zinc can be replaced by Cu(I) without the need for large structural rearrangements. In other words the less favourable enthalpy changes by binding 6 Cu(I) atoms to only seven cysteines in NcMT are compensated by the smaller differences in entropy when copper substitutes zinc in Zn3≠NcMT, rather than binding to apo-NcMT. The variable coordination number of copper, which can adopt a linear two-coordinate (digonal) or a distorted planar trigonal three-coordinate geometry with sulfur ligands [49] adds an additional level of complexity in solving the copper MT structures. These coordination possibilities of the copper(I) ions are perhaps responsible for the titration of the apo-NcMT to a non-native (4 : 1) stoichiometry. In the case of the NcMT, it seems that the coordination of zinc in Zn3NcMT was necessary to conform/stabilize a structure such that the Cu(I) titration produced the native Cu6Cys7 metal≠thiolate cluster rather than the Cu4Cys7 made from apo-NcMT which gave rise to a family of rapidly interconverting structures. The resultant Cu6Cys7 core appears to constrain the peptide sufficiently to enable its 3D solution structure to be determined. The requirement that the synthetic Cu(I)MT be made from a Zn-protein in vitro to obtain an NMR spectrum identical to that of the native Cu(I)MT raises questions about how the organism controls the formation of the Cu(I)NcMT in vivo. If the Zn(II)NcMT were to form in vivo when NcMT was induced by copper exposure one might expect that it would be a very short

Cu(I) atoms are rendered according to their van der Waals radii. The Cys side-chains are rendered as grey sticks with the Cys sulfur atom shown in light grey. The modelling of Cu(I) binding as depicted was accomplished by attempting to best satisfy known bond lengths and altering the Cys chi side-chain angle to point the sulfur atoms towards the centre. The figure was prepared using INSIGHTII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The backbone fold of the NcMT protein is shown in black with the carbons and sulfur of the cysteine side chains shown in dark grey and light grey, respectively. The Cu(I) atoms are rendered as ∞ medium grey spheres with a van der Waals radius of 0.95 A. Taking into consideration the Cu(I)≠S luminescence which indicate a protected copper core, we have manually rotated the Cys side-chain 1cys and 2cys angles to direct the sulfur atoms into the core of the protein.

lived and hard to isolate species as copper ions would be expected to readily displace the Zn(II). However, there are no in vivo data to indicate that the organism has to form a zinc precursor. The requirement of Zn(II) in the formation of Cu(I)MT clusters, in particular the b-domain, has been observed for mouse MT [50]. Additionally, the same spacing of cysteine residues is also found in the repressor protein CopY from Enterococcus hirae and it is apparent that the metal-binding properties of this protein may require the binding of Zn(II) in this site [51,52]. The stability of the Cu(I)-S core and the DNA-binding activity are dependent on zinc binding. In addition, the copper chaperone CopZ is a specific source of copper for the Zn-form of CopY [51]. However, apo-CopY does not demonstrate this specificity suggesting a potential loss of structure that confers this property. A combination of the data suggests that Zn(II)-binding to these cysteine-rich, copper-binding sites orders a structure that is required for activity. A model structure of Cu6NcMT demonstrating the shielding of the copper core, using one model with copper atoms satisfying the Cu≠S bond distances and minimizing any interactions within the NMR structure, is shown in Fig. 7. While there is probably a multitude of models that would fit the NMR data, there is no way to confirm any from NMR studies using the NMR inactive Cu(I) metal form of the protein. The NcMT backbone structure presented here uses no specific metal≠Cys restraints and a low number of long-range NOE constraints. However, the mouse a-MT-1 structures calculated with and without specific metal≠Cys restraints support the assertion that metal≠Cys restraints are not required for precise and accurate structure determination of the protein backbone with NMR data collected at 800 MHz. The a-domain of MT-1 was also used to assess the requirements for longrange NMR restraints in structure calculations. Although both the length of the a-domain of mouse MT1 (31 vs. 25 amino acids in NcMT) and the number of NOEs (256 vs. 152 for NcMT) is larger for mouse MT1, the backbone r.m.s.d. between structures calculated without ∞ metal≠cysteine restraints is comparable for NcMT (1.94 A ∞ for mouse MT1 and 1.59 A for NcMT). Evaluation of the relationship between the number of long-range NOEs and the resulting r.m.s.d. is relevant in MTs because of their lack of defined secondary structure. In more typical proteins, the translational and rotational positions of the residues contained in a secondary structural element (a-helix, b-sheet) might be spatially defined by as little as a single long-range contact to the rest of the molecule. However, in MT, which is composed mostly of coils and loops, the spatial orientation of relatively large regions cannot be positioned by such a single critical restraint. In conclusion we have described a new MT fold for the N. crassa Cu6MT which consists of a half left- and half right-handedly polypeptide backbone wrapped around the copper(I)-cysteine cluster. No direct information about the metal≠sulfur connectivities could be obtained by using an isomorphic, NMR active metal substitute for Cu+, such as Ag+, because a stable homogenous Ag substituted NcMT could not be prepared. Nevertheless, the use of data at 800 MHz on the reconstituted Cu6NcMT was sufficient to allow for an accurate backbone fold to be determined.
