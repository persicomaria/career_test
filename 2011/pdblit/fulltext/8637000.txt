It is also widely used as a biochemical tool to ADP-ribosylate GTP-binding proteins in the study of signal transduction. Results: The crystal structure of pertussis toxin has been determined at 2.9A resolution. The catalytic A-subunit (S1) shares structural homology with other ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxins, although differences in the carboxy-terminal portion explain its unique activation mechanism.

The structural similarity is all the more surprising given that there is almost no sequence homology between Bsubunits of the different toxins. Two peripheral domains that are unique to the pertussis toxin B-oligomer show unexpected structural homology with a calcium-dependent eukaryotic lectin, and reveal possible receptorbinding sites. Conclusion: The structure provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of pertussis toxin and the evolution of bacterial toxins. Knowledge of the tertiary structure of the active site forms a rational basis for elimination of catalytic activity in recombinant molecules for vaccine use.

Introduction
Pertussis toxin (PT) belongs to the A-B class of toxins, which contain functionally distinct domains responsible for binding to cell surfaces (B) and for catalytic activity (A). Despite their common functional organization, A-B toxins differ in the details of their quaternary structures, sequences and pathogenic mechanisms. The structures of some bacterial A-B toxins are already known, including members of the cholera toxin [1] and Shiga toxin (M Fraser and M James, personal communication) [2] families, PseudomonasexotoxinA [3] and diphtheria toxin [4]. PT is a hexameric protein comprising five different subunits (S1, S2, S3, two copies of S4, and S5) [5], with a total MW of 105 kDa. Its A-component (subunit S1) shares about 20 % sequence identity with the A-subunit of cholera toxin [6,7]. Its B-component consists of the remaining five subunits. The amino acid sequences of S2 and S3 are 70% identical [6,7], but no other sequence homology has been recognized between the different PT B-subunits, or between these sequences and the B-subunits of other bacterial toxins. PT is released by virulent Bordetellapertussis a latent in form, and attaches to target cells through an interaction between the B-oligomer and glycoconjugate receptors

on the cell surface [8-10]. Many of the biological effects of PT are thought to result from the catalytic activity of the A-subunit (S1) acting inside target cells, but the processes of membrane translocation, and of holotoxin dissociation, are poorly understood. Reduction of

the disulphide bond in S1 is essential for catalytic'activity, and adenine nucleotides and lipid moieties are also required in vitro [11-13]. Activated S1 catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to a cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus of the c-subunit of certain trimeric GTP-binding proteins. Covalent modification of this cysteine de-

couples the G-protein c-subunit from its receptor. Protein targets of PT include Gi, a negative regulatory component of the adenylate cyclase complex, and trans-

ducin, which is involved in retinal signal transduction.
Interaction of the B-oligomer with receptors on certain eukaryotic cells can also mediate biological effects that are independent of the catalytic activity of S1, including proliferation of T lymphocytes [14], agglutination of erythrocytes [15] and adherence of bacteria to host cells [16]. PT plays a central role in the pathogenesis of whooping cough [16,17], and in the development of protective immunity against reinfection [18,19]. Whooping cough is still an important cause of infant morbidity and mor-

tality worldwide, resulting in about 400 000 deaths each year [20]. Control of the disease by vaccination has been compromised by uncertainty about the safety of the traditional vaccines made of chemically inactivated whole B. pertussis cells. Recent studies [21-23] have found no evidence to support a claim that these vaccines can cause permanent neurological damage [24], but they may be associated with less serious adverse reactions [23]. Alternative acellular vaccines containing pure forms of PT and other immunoprotective components of B. pertussis are currently being developed [25]. Site-directed mutagenesis can be used to make a biologically inactive PT molecule that retains its immunogenicity, suitable for use in a vaccine. The catalytic activity of PT can be almost completely eliminated by mutating certain residues in S1 [26-28]. Cell-binding activity can also be reduced by mutating residues in the B-oligomer [29,30], but the importance of specific residues in receptor binding is still uncertain. We have determined the crystal structure of PT to obtain detailed information about functional and immunological determinants needed to perfect the design of recombinant PT molecules suitable for use as components of acellular vaccines. The structure also provides a step towards understanding the way that PT interacts with eukaryotic cells and modifies their functions. Comparison of PT with the known structures of other A-B bacterial toxins suggests how they may have evolved.

This central domain consists of a ring of 30 antiparallel 1-strands, surrounding a barrel formed by five -helices. The pore of the barrel is partially penetrated by the carboxyl terminus of S1. Compared with the other PT B-subunits, S2 and S3 each contain an amino-terminal extension of - 100 residues. These amino-terminal regions form additional domains at the periphery of the B-oligomer.
A-subunit

The amino-terminal 175 residues of S1 share a common fold with the enzymatic portion (Al) of the Asubunit of heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli (LT) [1,331, a member of the cholera toxin family (Figs la, 2 and 3), consistent with their similar catalytic functions. Like S1, the LT Al-fragment ADP-ribosylates the a-subunit of trimeric G-protein targets, but it attacks a different amino acid residue (an arginine, rather than a cysteine), resulting in different target specificity. Pairwise superposition of 116 Caot atoms from the two toxin A-subunits (6-20, 22-26, 28-38, 48-67, 84-104, 125-148, 155-168, 170-175 of S1, with 4-18, 21-25, 37-47, 57-76, 81-101, 108-131, 134-147, 152-157 of the A-subunit of LT) yields an rms difference of 2.0k Of these 116 residues, 33 are identical. All secondary structure elements (see legend to Fig. 2 for secondary structure assignments) within this region are conserved, except for helix a5 in PT which has no equivalent in LT. Strands P4 and P8, and helices a3 and a4 of PT are longer than in LT, and there are significant differences in connecting loops. Residues 176-235 of S1 have no structural homologue in LT. Analysis of carboxy-terminal deletion mutants [27,34,35] has shown that this part of S1 is not essential for catalytic activity in vitro. A stretch of residues in extended conformation is followed by two short strands (p10 and 1311), a helix (al6), and a further strand (p12). 3-strands 10-12 form a small antiparallel sheet. The carboxyl terminus enters a pore in the centre of the B-oligomer with a short helix (a7), and ends within the pore. Residues 211-220 of S1 (between a6 and p12) have poor density and could not be modelled. A disordered region occurs in a roughly equivalent part of the LT A-subunit, at the junction of Al and A2, and proteolytic cleavage at this site is necessary for activation. There is no evidence that proteolysis is essential for activation of PT, although tryptic cleavage of S1 at Arg218 was found to enhance activation in vitro [36]. The disulphide bond in S1 (Cys41-Cys201) is not structurally equivalent to the disulphide in the A-subunit of LT, but in both cases, reduction is essential for catalytic activity. The orientation of the A-subunit with respect to the B-oligomer is strikingly different in LT and in PT (Fig. 3). The A-subunit (S1) of PT is rotated by approximately 180' relative to the A-subunit of LT, resulting in significant differences in the A-B interaction (described below).

Results and discussion
PT was crystallized by a modification of conditions described by Spangler et al. [31]. The crystals are in space group P21212 1 with cell dimensions a = 163.8A, b = 98.2A, c = 194.5K The asymmetric unit contains two molecules related by non-crystallographic two-fold symmetry. Similar crystals were reported by Raghavan et al [32]. The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement, followed by phase improvement using solvent flattening and two-fold averaging techniques. The model contains 98 % of all possible protein atoms, with no solvent. The crystallographic R-factor is 19.5 % for all reflections between 10.0 and 2.9A, with a root mean square (rms) deviation from ideality of 0.014 A for bond distances and 1.8' for bond
angles. Overall structure

Schematic pictures of the holotoxin and of the Boligomer are shown in Fig. 1, and Cot representations of separate subunits in Fig. 2. The large enzymatic Asubunit (S1) is pyramid-shaped, and rests on a disc-like base formed by the cell-binding B-oligomer (S2, S3, two copies of S4, and S5). Each of the five B-subunits contains a similar fold of - 100 residues. These regions interact with approximate five-fold symmetry to form a pentameric domain in the centre of the B-oligomer.

Active site As expected, the active site of S1 in PT (Fig. 4a) is structurally homologous to the active sites of other known ADP-ribosylating bacterial toxins (LT, exotoxinA and diphtheria toxin). Ca atoms of 46 active site residues of PT can be superimposed on equivalents in the other toxins with an rms difference of 1.0A for LT, 1.5A for exotoxin-A and 1.6A for diphtheria toxin. Alignment of the active site sequences based on this structural superposition (Fig. 4b), shows that only two residues are conserved in all four toxins, Tyr8 and Glu129 in PT. The glutamic acid has been shown to be essential for enzymatic activity in PT [27,37,38] and in each of the other toxins. In PT, the side chain of Glu129 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of His35, Ser52 and Gln127. Mutation of His35 is associated with greatly reduced ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [39]. Ser52 lies within a region of

S1 (residues 51-59) that shows close sequence identity with LT and cholera toxin. A possible site of NAD binding in S1 is suggested by superimposing the active site of diphtheria toxin bound to the dinucleotide, adenylyl-3,5-uridine monophosphate (ApUp) [4] onto the active site of PT. The structures of ApUp and NAD differ in many respects, but their adenine groups probably bind to the protein in similar ways. The position of the adenine of the superimposed ApUp (Fig. 4a) implies that a region of S1 near Cys201 would have to move to allow access of NAD and the G-protein substrate to the active site. Such a shift would require cleavage of the disulphide bond between Cys41 and Cys201, explaining why reduction is essential for expression of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity [11,12]. The inferred site of NAD binding in S1 is consistent with experimental findings suggest-

ing that Glu129 [37], Cys41 [39,40] and Trp26 [41] may interact with NAD. Side chains of Arg9, Aspll, Argl3 and Phe23 also project into this site in the crystal structure. Mutations of Arg9, Aspll or Argl3 reduce or eliminate catalytic activity [26-28,35]. These residues lie within another region of Si (residues 8-15) that shows close sequence homology with LT and cholera toxin. A hydrogen bond is present between the Nc of Arg9 and the backbone carbonyl group of Ser52, linking an adjacent pair of strands in the active site cleft. This may be important in maintaining the conformation of the active site, as previously noted in LT [33]. The proposed mechanism for opening the active site pocket would disrupt some critical interactions between S1 and the B-oligomer, and may also expose the hydrophobic sequence near Cys201 (184-203). This sequence scores highly as a potential membrane-spanning helix [42]. It has been shown that S1 associates less readily with the B-oligomer [40], but more readily with phospholipid vesicles [43], after disulphide reduction. Membrane insertion of the hydrophobic sequence could play a role either in localizing active S1 near its membrane bound G-protein substrate, or in initiating membrane translocation of the A-subunit.
B-oligomer The carboxy-terminal - 100 residues of S2 and S3,

pentamer around a central pore lined by five helices. The same type of B-subunit interaction, but with more perfect five-fold symmetry, is seen in the B-pentamers of LT and verotoxin-1. In PT, the most extensive interactions between B-subunit monomers are those of S2 with S4, and S3 with S4, in agreement with the observation that the B-oligomer dissociates in 5 M urea into an S2/S4 dimer, an S3/S4 dimer and an S5 monomer [5]. An interesting resemblance to the toxin B-pentamers was recently observed in the 9A structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, determined by electron microscopy [47]. The amino-terminal - 100 residues of S2 and S3 form separate domains at the periphery of the B-oligomer. Each of these domains consists of five 3-strands and two a-helices, with a fold similar to that of the lectin domain from a rat mannose binding protein (MBP) [48] (Fig. 6), which belongs to a family of calcium-dependent (C-type) eukaryotic lectins. Pairwise superposition of 47 Ca atoms of the two proteins yields an rms difference of 2.2A. Differences between PT and MBP are mainly within the amino-terminal part of the fold (orange in Fig. 6a). Strand 31 and helix al of MBP are replaced, in PT, by a loop region that makes some irregular main chain hydrogen bonds with adjacent structure. This is followed, in PT, by a short strand (p1) and a helix (al), replacing an extended strand in MBP. The remaining secondary structure (purple in Fig. 6a) is well conserved between the two proteins (helix a2, three antiparallel strands [32-4, and strand P5). 135 in PT is a long twisted strand with complicated interactions; at its amino-terminal end it makes main chain hydrogen bonds with parts of the amino-terminal loop region, and with strands 31 and 32; at its carboxyterminal end it forms an antiparallel pair with the fifth P-strand of the carboxy-terminal domain (10). Only one of the two disulphides in MBP (Cys28-Cysll17) is conserved in S2 and S3 (Cys27-Cys83). In PT, a short turn replaces 36 residues that form a series of loops between strands P2 and 33 in MBP (green in Fig. 6a).
Receptor-binding sites

both copies of S4, and S5 have similar folds, consisting of six antiparallel -strands forming a closed 3barrel, capped by an t-helix between the fourth and fifth strands (Figs lb, 2 and 5a). The fold has been recognized previously in several proteins which bind either an oligosaccharide or an oligonucleotide, and named the oligomer-binding (OB) fold [44,45]. Other proteins containing the OB fold include the B-subunits of LT [1,33], and of E. coli verotoxin-1 [2], a member of the Shiga toxin family. Their structural similarity with PT had been anticipated [46] although there is no detectable sequence homology. A structural superposition and sequence alignment of the B-subunits of PT, LT and verotoxin-1 are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. The PT B-subunits differ from the verotoxin-1 and LT B-subunits at the amino and carboxyl termini, and in the length and conformation of loops, particularly between the third and fourth -strands, between the fourth -strand and the helix, and between the fifth and sixth -strands. Two disulphide bonds are conserved in all the PT B-subunits, but neither is structurally equivalent to the single disulphides in LT or verotoxin- Bmonomers. The first disulphide has an unusual site between the third and fourth -strands (Cys120-Cysl34 in S2 and S3, Cys31-Cys51 in S4 and Cys27-Cys41 in S5), with the sulphur atoms projecting from the other surface of the -barrel. A second disulphide links the carboxyl terminus to the end of the sixth -strand (Cysl92-Cysl99 in S2 and S3, Cys103-Cys109 in S4, Cys92-Cys98 in S5). Adjacent B-subunits associate mainly through antiparallel 3-sheet interactions to form a rather asymmetrical

PT has lectin-like properties, binding to glycoconjugates on target cell surfaces, and to the oligosaccharide moieties of many serum glycoproteins [8-10]. The toxin preferentially recognizes asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains containing a(2-6)-linked sialic acid residues [8]. However, a number of complex carbohydrate sequences are bound, and there is evidence that PT contains at least two distinct binding domains, with different specificities, on subunits S2 and S3 [10,49-51]. Most of the sequence differences between S2 and S3 are found near the amino termini, suggesting that these regions may contain determinants of binding specificity. The crystal structure shows that the distinct folds of the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal por-

tions of S2 and S3 are each homologous with known carbohydrate-binding proteins. Surprisingly, although the amino-terminal domains of S2 and S3 show overall structural homology with a member of the family of C-type eukaryotic lectins (Fig. 6), they apparently lack its functional region. Thirty-two conserved amino acids in the sequences of known Ctype lectins are believed to contribute to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CaRD). Features of the amino-terminal sequences of S2 and S3 thought to be characteristic of the CaRD motif were reported [51], but with the exception of the disulphide bond (Cys23-Cys87), they are not consistent with the observed structural relationship. None of the remaining

CaRD residues can be identified in the structure-based sequence alignment of S2 and S3 with MBP (Fig. 6c). In the MBP structure, the calcium ligands lie within a long loop between strands P2 and 33 that was found to be the carbohydrate-binding site [52]. This loop has no structural equivalent in S2/S3 (Fig. 6a), and there is no evidence that calcium is required for receptor binding. Re-evaluation of experimental findings in the light of the crystal structure points to two regions of the aminoterminal domains of S2 and S3 that may be involved in receptor binding. Both sites are exposed and lie on the probable membrane-binding surface of the toxin (furthest from S1). The first site is the loop between residues 18 and 23. This sequence in S2 was found

1 and native 2 structures, which differ by a rigid-body shift of the entire dimer (see Materials and methods).] A-B interaction The interaction between the A-subunit (S1) and the B-oligomer differs surprisingly from that in the LT structure (Fig. 3). In LT, the interaction is mediated almost entirely by the carboxy-terminal A2-fragment and the pore in the centre of the B-pentamer [1,33]. There are few other contacts because the most pointed surface of the A-subunit faces the B-pentamer. In PT, the pore is more of a pit, as the carboxyl terminus of S1 only penetrates halfway through the B-oligomer. Additional interactions result from the way that the A-subunit of PT is oriented so that a flat surface rests against the B-oligomer. In PT, the amount of surface buried between the A and B components (4606A2, calculated using the program DSSP [55]) is at the upper end of

[53] to be homologous to residues 62-67 in wheat germ agglutinin, which form part of the sialic acid binding site determined crystallographically [54]. Synthetic peptides incorporating this sequence bind to sialic acid containing glycoconjugates [53]. These segments of the two crystal structures are in fact very similar; residues 18-23 of S2 can be superimposed on residues 62-67 of wheat germ agglutinin with an rms difference of only 1.03 A for 22 main chain atoms. A second site that may play a role in carbohydrate recognition is helix cc2 (residues 39-48). Exchange mutation of residues 37-52 between S2 and S3 was reported to be associated with an exchange of binding specificities [51]. The central pentameric domain of the PT B-oligomer may also be involved in receptor binding, as in the previously recognized proteins that contain the OB-fold. Crystallographically determined binding sites of other proteins with this fold [45] are in variable loops between 2-133, 134- and 5-P6 (verotoxin-1 numbering), but they lie in similar locations with respect to the overall structure. An extended binding site on S2 or S3 might span one or more of these carboxy-terminal domain loops (137-,38, P39--3 and 10-p11), as well as parts of the amino-terminal domain. Mutations in the vicinity of 5-136 and 10-P11 of S2 and S3 have been found to affect receptor binding [29]. The two holotoxin molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal have similar orientations with respect to their membrane-binding surface, with the five-fold axes of the two B-oligomers being roughly parallel. Part of the S2-S4 interface of one molecule makes van der Waals interactions with the same region of the second molecule. The amount of surface buried on both sides of the interface (1269A2, calculated with DSSP [55] ) is sufficient for a stable complex. This unusual molecular packing might represent a physiological dimer with a multivalent receptor-binding site formed by parts of the B-oligomer of each molecule. [The interaction between the two molecules is essentially identical in the native

the range observed byJanin et al. [56] in their study of the interfaces of oligomeric proteins, though they studied mostly smaller proteins. However, in other respects this interface is typical - the residues comprising it are not particularly hydrophobic, the number of hydrogen bonds and other electrostatic interactions (18) is in the range expected for this size of interface and arginine residues are prevalent (8 of the 79 residues in contact). When the carboxy-terminal residues 228-235 of S1 are omitted from the calculation, the buried surface is reduced to 3337A2, which is still substantial. Additional interactions come from four elements of structure that are extended or differ in conformation compared with their counterparts in LT - helix c3, the loop between helices ac4 and c5, the P-bend connecting strands 138-39, and strands [10-11. The extended interface between the A and B components of PT would not be possible if the B-oligomer were a pentamer of identical monomers, since the A-subunit lacks even approximate five-fold symmetry. Structures are now known of the complete AB5 assemblies of representative members of three bacterial toxin families; LT, representing the cholera toxin family [1], Shiga toxin (M Fraser and MJames, personal communication), and PT. Each of these toxins has a cell-binding B-oligomer made of five subunits. The five B-subunits are identical in LT and in Shiga toxin, but in PT they are different. All these toxin B-subunits adopt the OB fold, so they may have arisen from a common ancestral protein, although their amino acid sequences are not homologous. The three distinct types of PT B-subunit (S2/S3, S4 and S5) almost certainly evolved from the same parent protein, since they share common structural features, such as the two disulphide bonds, that are not present in the B-subunits of LT and Shiga toxin. The S2/S3 precursor gene presumably recruited an additional gene encoding the large amino-terminal extension, then S2 and S3 arose from a more recent

Fig. 6. (a) Schematic pictures of the amino-terminal 93 residues of 53 (left) and mannose-binding protein (MBP) (right). The view, relative to Fig. la, is a rotation of S3 through approximately 144° about the five-fold axis of the B-oligomer, such that the orientation of S3 in this figure is similar to that of S2 in Fig. la. -strands are shown as arrows, and ac-helices as spirals. The most similar part of the fold in the two proteins is coloured purple, and the least similar part, orange. The carbohydrate-binding loop of MBP, and its structural equivalent in PT, are green. The amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini of each protein are labelled. (b) Stereo view of an electron density map showing the short turn between P2 and 3 in S3. The map is calculated with coefficients (2mlFol - DFcl)exp(iocc) [681 and contoured at the rms deviation of the electron density in the unit cell. Contours further than 1.5 A from atoms in the figure are omitted for clarity. (c) Sequence alignment of 47 structurally equivalent residues in the aminoterminal domains of S2 and S3 and in MBP. Sequence identity between MBP and S2 is 8/47 and between MBP and and S3 is 10/47. Residue identities involving MBP are highlighted in bold lettering. MBP coordinates (1MSB) were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Databank. Chain A of the MBP dimer was used for the superposition.

gene duplication event. Perhaps the various PT B-subunits have evolved in different ways to satisfy complex receptor-binding requirements. The functional receptors for cholera toxin and Shiga toxin are glycolipids, but PT appears to bind to glycoproteins using binding domains with different specificities [10,49-51].

Since PT and LT show structural homology in parts of both the A-subunit and the B-oligomer, it is possible that they evolved from a common AB ancestor. 5 However, intriguingly, the A-B interaction is completely different in the holotoxins (Fig. 3). Divergent evolution would have had to involve a series of mutations that,

in effect, rotated the A-subunit while changing contacts on both sides of the interface. A simpler alternative is that the A and B subunits evolved independently from a common ancestral A-subunit and a common ancestral B-subunit. The finding that the structurally related B-oligomers of the known AB toxins have recruited 5 different catalytic A-subunits supports this view. The B-oligomer of Shiga toxin is associated with a ricin-like A-subunit, while the B-oligomers of LT and PT are associated in different ways with an ADP-ribosyltransferase.

toxins, with lectin-like properties. The PT structure reveals two additional domains of the Boligomer, with no equivalent in the cholera toxin or Shiga toxin families, that resemble members of the family of calcium-dependent eukaryotic lectins.

Biological implications Pertussis toxin (PT) is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of whooping cough, and in eliciting a protective immune response. The crystal structure provides insight into underlying molecular mechanisms, and will help in the design of biologically-inactive recombinant PT molecules suitable for use as components of acellular vaccines. PT shares structural homology with other A-B bacterial toxins, indicating an evolutionary relationship. Structural comparisons may advance the understanding of common mechanisms that are relevant to other toxin-associated diseases besides whooping cough. The catalytic A-subunit of PT (SI) is structurally similar to the catalytic domains of other ADP-ribosylating toxins, being most closely related to the cholera toxin family. The structure shows details of the active site, and provides a rational basis for elimination of enzyme activity in recombinant molecules for vaccine use. Activation of PT, unlike that of other ADP-ribosylating toxins, does not require proteolysis, but involves only reduction of a disulphide bond in the catalytic subunit. This may induce a conformational change involving the carboxy-terminal part of S1 that opens the active site cleft, allowing entry of catalytic substrates. In addition, the exposure of a hydrophobic sequence in S1 may play a role either in localizing S1 near its membrane-bound substrates, or in initiating translocation. The heteropentameric B-oligomer of PT contains the fold that was previously found in the homopentameric B-oligomers of the cholera toxin and Shiga toxin families, despite there being almost no sequence homology between these toxin B-subunits. In each case, the B-oligomer is responsible for targeting toxic activity by recognition of specific cell surface receptors. PT has more complex receptor-binding characteristics than the other

Materials and methods Protein purification and crystallization Pertussis toxin was purified from culture supematants of B. pertussis strain 10536 as previously described [57]. Stock solutions in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH8.0 (50 % v/v glycerol) were stored at - 20°C. PT samples (1.2-2.0mgml-1) were dialyzed against buffer 1 (25mM Na/K-phosphate, pH8.0/0.25M KCV1/0.02 % NaN3). Seed crystals were grown by the hanging drop method, equilibrated against a precipitant of 0.3-0.5 M KCI in buffer 1. Macroseeds transferred to protein drops equilibrated against 0.26-0.35 M KCI in buffer 1 grew typically to a size of 0.3mm x 0.2mm x 0.15mm. X-ray diffraction data Data were collected using a synchrotron radiation source (k = 1.04A) and image plate detector on the Weissenberg camera [58] at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. Data collection parameters were, typically, 30 oscillations at 2°sec-1 over oscillation angles of 3.5°. The data were processed using WEIS [59] and programs in the CCP4 package [SERC (UK) Collaborative Computer Project 4, Daresbury Laboratory, UK, 1979]. Data from different crystals tend to merge poorly and vary in quality, but the problem has been partly overcome by using freshly grown crystals from the same fresh protein preparation. Data are summarized in Table 2. Initially the best native dataset (native 1) was collected to 3.3 A resolution from a crystal soaked in 20 mM trimethyl lead acetate for 14 days, although these data do not differ significantly from true native data. Later, a 2.9A dataset

(native 2) was collected, that merged poorly with native 1 and

the heavy atom derivative data. The native 2 data were collected from a crystal that had been soaked in 30 mM NAD for 3 days, although difference Fourier analyses showed no evidence of binding. True native crystals were soaked respectively in saturated di-p-iodobis-(ethylenediamine) di-platinum(II)nitrate (PIP) for 7 days, saturated (NH 3)2Pt(NO 2 2 for 7 days, 1mM KIrCI6 for 3 ) days, 1mM KAu(CN) 2 for. 5 days and 1 mM OsC13 for 3 days. Structure determination Starting phases were determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR). Seven heavy atom sites were identified in the PIP derivative with SHELXS [60] using native 1 as native data. Parameters for these sites were refined with MLPHARE [61], and further sites in the PIP and other derivatives were found by iterative use of difference Fourier analyses and heavy atom refinement. The overall figure of merit was 0.44 (25-3.5fA). The MIR phases were improved by solvent flattening with the DEMON density modification package (FMD Vellieux, unpublished program), using a conservative solvent fraction of 50 %. With two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the crystals contain 67 % solvent by volume. The resulting map showed a clear solvent boundary outlining the two holotoxin molecules. The non-crystallographic two-fold axis was determined by a domain rotation function [62], using structure factors calculated in space group P1 from isolated spheres of density corresponding to each molecule. The translation needed to superimpose rotated density from one molecule onto the density sphere for the sec-

ond molecule was calculated with a phased translation function [62,63]. An envelope around the two toxin molecules was calculated from a local correlation map (prompted by the similar approach of Podjamy and Rees [64]), enclosing 44% of the asymmetric unit. Two-fold averaging and solvent flattening were carried out using the DEMON package, with gradual phase extension from 5.0 to 3.5k Interpretation of the resulting map was made easier by the recognition of similarity with known structures, which helped to define the secondary structure connections and chain direction in a large part of the map. The amino-terminal three-quarters of S1 resembles the A-subunit of LT [1,331. A model of the Al-subunit. of LT was positioned in the density corresponding to Si using a domain rotation function and phased translation function. The central part of the B-oligomer shares the fold that was found in the B-pentamers of LT and verotoxin-1 [2]. Five separate verotoxin-1 B-monomers were placed manually in the central part of the B-oligomer density using the program O [65].

to the original model, but there are no large internal domain shifts.

Current model
The current PT model contains 1868 amino acid residues (934 in each molecule, comprising 224/235 in S1, 196/199 in S2 and S3, 110/110 in both copies of S4, 98/99 in S5), with no solvent molecules. Missing residues are in regions of poor density at the amino termini, plus ten residues (211-220) near the carboxyl terminus of S1. The electron density is compatible with the amino acid sequence from B. pertussisstrain 10536 [69], which differs from that previously reported [6,7] at two positions in S1 (Asp34 -*Glu and Ile198 -Val). The model includes restrained individual isotropic temperature factors. The crystallographic Rfactor is 19.5% for all reflections between 10.0 and 2.9k The rms deviation from ideality is 0.014A for bond distances and 1.8' for bond angles. In the Ramachandran plot of each molecule, 82 % of the residues are in the most favoured regions and none are in disallowed regions [70]. The rms difference in coordinates of all main-chain atoms after superposition of the two molecules is 0.21 k The average main chain B-factor is 22.2 A2 for molecule 1 and 40.2 A2 for molecule 2. Molecule 2 makes fewer crystal packing contacts than molecule 1. In each holotoxin molecule, the two copies of S4 have essentially identical folds, and can be superimposed with an rms difference for all 110 Cot atoms of 0.56A (0.32 A after omitting 21 C atoms in loops and at the carboxyl terminus). Superposition of S2 and S3 shows a significant shift only at the carboxyl terminus, with an rms difference for the remaining 188 Cat atom pairs (residues 4-191) of 0.63A. Atomic coordinates for the pertussis toxin structure have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

Model building and refinement
A partial model of one PT molecule was built using O, based on a skeletonized map produced with BONES [66] and guided by the positioned models. The peripheral domains of the Boligomer (formed by the amino-terminal portions of S2 and S3) were built without reference to a known structure. The second PT molecule was generated using the non-crystallographic symmetry operation. The distinction between S2 and S3 was made surprisingly easily by differences in side-chain density, especially at positions 26 Lys/Gly, 50 Arg/Pro, 65 Gly/Gln, 143 Trp/Arg and 148 Arg/Ala. The initial PT model, (85 % of the residues, with 5 % fitted as polyalanine) was refined by rigid body refinement and energy minimization using X-PLOR [67]. Phases from the refined model were combined with the original MIR phases using SIGMAA [68]. Errors in the initial PT model were clearly shown in the map calculated with the combined phases. Iterative cycles of model building, simulated annealing refinement with X-PLOR (including a non-crystallographic symmetry restraint), and combination of model and MIR phases resulted in a model that was 98% complete. The 3.3 model was then refined against the 2.9A native 2 dataset using rigid body refinement and simulated annealing in X-PLOR. Further model building and refinement was carried out with the higher resolution data. The new model shows an overall rotation of 2.7 ° and a translation of 0.2 A relative
