Abstract Ciphergen surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization ZSELDI. protein chip technology was used to analyze the secretion and autoactivation of the Streptococcus pyogenes cysteine protease SpeB. This method allowed rapid identification of both the zymogen form of the protein Mr ; 41,000 and the fully active enzyme Mr ; 28,500. SpeB production in culture supernatants was demonstrated to be growth-phase regulated and SpeB positive and negative variants of a blood passaged S. pyogenes isolate could readily be distinguished. In kinetic studies of the autoactivation of the zymogen form of SpeB, the sequential generation of four intermediates was detected before the accumulation of the fully active enzyme. The methods described enabled enhanced speed, use of lower sample volumes and concentrations, and a more complete molecular characterization of SpeB than allowed by existing methods of analysis using SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction The secreted cysteine protease of Streptococcus pyogenes, SpeB, has been implicated as a virulence factor in group A streptococcal infections ZKapur et al., 1994; Burns et al., 1997; Gubba et al., 1998; Lukomski et al., 1998.. This enzyme is capable of activating human prorIL1b and may contribute to some of the toxic shock-like symptoms associated with certain streptococcal infections ZBurns et al.,

1997.. In addition, SpeB can post-translationally modify certain bacterial products, e.g. streptolysin O ZShanley et al., 1996. or the antiphagocytic M protein ZElliot, 1945; Berge and Bjorck, 1995; Raeder et al., 1998, 2000.. Post-translational modification of SLO by SpeB is associated with increased severity in a lung toxicity model ZShanley et al., 1996. while degradation of the M protein may reduce the invasive potential of certain M1 serotype group A isolates ZRaeder and Boyle, 1996.. SpeB is the predominant secreted protein present in stationary phase culture supernatants of certain S. pyogenes isolates grown aerobically to stationary phase in Todd≠Hewitt broth at 378C. SpeB can be present in culture supernatants as either an Mr ;

41,000 zymogen protein or as an Mr ; 28,500 fully active enzyme ZElliot, 1945; Raeder et al., 1998.. The zymogen is converted to the active enzyme through an autocatalytic reaction that can be initiated by treatment with a reducing agent, e.g. dithiothreitol or by lowering the pH - 6.5 ZElliot, 1945; French et al., 1990; Doran et al., 1999.. Critical interactions between the bacterial membrane and the SpeB protein are also believed to be important for appropriate folding and subsequent activation of the zymogen protein ZLiu and Elliot, 1965a,b; Collin and Olsen, 2000.. Autoactivation can be inhibited by the addition of the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 ZBarrett et al., 1982; Raeder et al., 1998.. Multiple rounds of growth of S. pyogenes in human blood leads to the selection of variants that demonstrate enhanced resistance to opsonophagocytosis ZRaeder et al., 2000.. When an SpeBq isolate 64 was passaged nine times in human blood, a mixture of stable SpeBq and SpeBy variants was recovered ZRaeder et al., 2000.. The selected bacteria also differed in colony morphology. The SpeBq strain expressed a low-level of hyaluronic acid capsule Zsmall colony variant., while the stable SpeBmutant over-expressed capsule Zlarge colony variant. ZRaeder et al., 2000.. Following greater than nine passages in human blood, all of the recovered isolates demonstrated a stable SpeBy phenotype ZRaeder et al., 2000.. To enable efficient characterization of SpeB expression and activity, we have developed a rapid method to study SpeB production and activity using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-timeof-flight ZSELDI-TOF. mass spectrometry using the Ciphergen protein chip reader system. This system consists of aluminum chips to which protein samples can be selectively bound based on the surface chemistry of the chip. Bound proteins are then cocrystallized with a large molar excess of small energy-absorbing molecules ZEAMs., which are usually organic acids. The chip is then placed into the protein chip reader and the bacterial protein EAM mixture desorbed and ionized by short intense pulses of N2 320-nm UV laser and detected by the time-offlight ZTOF. in a mass spectrometer. The ions will experience a voltage difference that results in movement through a vacuum and detection by an ion detector. The mass of the protein can then

be precisely determined based on TOF and internal standards. Proteinsrpeptides between 1 and 350 kDa can be routinely analyzed with femtomolar sensitivity and molecular weights can be assigned with an accuracy of between 0.01% and 0.3% depending on the relative size of the protein Z www.ciphergen.com.. In this study, we have used the SELDI protein chip technology to characterize SpeB production by S. pyogenes. Methods have been developed to enable rapid sensitive analysis of the active and zymogen forms of the cysteine protease and also to monitor steps in the autoactivation reaction.

2. Material and methods 2.1. Bacteria The well-characterized M non-typable isolate 64 was used for the studies described in this report ZYarnall and Boyle, 1986; Boyle et al., 1994.. The parent isolate 64 Z64p. secretes SpeB in culture and stable isogenic SpeBy mutants could be isolated following greater than nine sequential passages of this isolate in human blood ZRaeder et al., 2000.. SpeB is the major secreted product when isolate 64 is grown in Todd≠Hewitt broth to stationary phase at 378C. 2.2. Isolation of extracellular streptococcal cysteine protease The SpeB cysteine protease was isolated from culture supernatants of isolate 64p by a modification of the method described by Elliot Z1945.. The wild type strain, 64p, was grown to stationary phase for 24 h at 378C in Todd≠Hewitt broth without shaking. To prevent autoactivation during overnight incubation, the cysteine protease inhibitor, E64 ZSigma, St. Louis, MO., was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 10 mM ZRaeder et al., 1998.. Bacteria were removed by centrifugation and filtration of the culture supernatant through a 0.22-mm filter. The filtered culture supernatants were brought to 80% saturation with ammonium sulphate. Precipitated material was recovered by centrifugation at 4000 = g for 20 min at 48C. The pellet was resuspended in distilled water containing 10 mM E64 to

1% of the original culture volume and dialyzed extensively against distilled water containing E64. This preparation contained an Mr ; 41,000 protein that lacked enzymatic activity Zsee Fig. 1.. The fully active form of the enzyme was generated by diluting the zymogen preparation 1:5 in water and passaging it over a PD-10 column ZPharmacia Fine Chemical, Piscataway, NJ. to remove E64. The resulting preparation contained a single Mr ; 28,500 band in Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels Zsee Fig. 1.. Both the Mr ; 41,000 zymogen SpeB protein and the Mr ; 28,500 enzymatically active form were recognized specifically on Western blots using a polyclonal antiserum to streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B, SpeB ZToxin Technologies, Sarasota, FL. and an appropriate second antibody-enzyme cognate reporter system Zsee Fig. 1..

2.3. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting Analysis of culture supernatants and purified zymogen and active SpeB was carried out by SDSPAGE and Western blotting analysis as described previously ZRaeder et al., 1998.. Essentially, proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 12% polyacrylamide mini-gels. Following electrophoresis, separated polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose ZBio-Rad. by electroblotting as described in Raeder et al. Z1998.. The nitrocellulose membranes were blocked and incubated overnight at ambient temperature in 10 ml of 0.15 M veronal buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 and then probed with 1:5000 dilution of the monospecific anti-SpeB antiserum. Following in-

Fig. 1. Characterization of zymogen and active SpeB. Zymogen and active SpeB, prepared as described in Section 2.2, was separated on parallel 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels. One gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue Zpanel A. while the second gel was transferred to nitrocellulose and proteins reactive with a polyclonal monospecific antibody to SpeB were detected by Western blotting as described in Section 2.3 Zpanel B.. The enzymatic activity of the zymogen and active form of SpeB were analyzed using a cysteine protease-selective synthetic substrate, Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-Nan as described in Section 2.4 ZPanel C..

cubation with specific antibody overnight at ambient temperature, with shaking, nitrocellulose membranes were washed and then incubated with a protein G alkaline phosphatase conjugate Z1:250. for 4 h, washed and developed using the BCIPrNBT phosphatase substrate ZKPL, Gaithersburg, MD. according to the manufacturers' instructions. Pre-stained molecular weight markers, low range ZBio-Rad, Richmond, CA. were included on each gel. 2.4. Assay for cysteine protease acti’ity Cysteine protease activity present in culture supernatants was assayed according to the method of North Z1994.. Briefly, 50 ml of the sample was added to wells of a microtiter plate containing 150 ml of substrate-buffer solution and the rate of cleavage of the substrate monitored by change in OD405 over time in a microtiter plate reader ZBioTeck, Winooska, VT.. The substrate-buffer solution consisted of 1.92 ml of 2.5 mM Bz-Pro-Phe-Arg-Nan ZSigma. dissolved in pH 4.0 distilled water plus 2.88 ml of 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 6.0. The cleavage of substrate and generation of product was determined to be linear with time to an A 405 of 1.5. In each assay utilizing bacterial culture media, a parallel sample pre-treated with an equal volume of 10 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min at 378C was included to allow for complete conversion of any zymogen SpeB in the sample to the fully active form. In addition, the cysteine-protease-specific inhibitor E64, was included in parallel assays at a concentration of 10 mM to determine if all of the enzyme activity being measured could be attributed to the presence of a cysteine protease ZBarrett et al., 1982.. 2.5. SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis was carried out using the Ciphergen protein chip system ZCiphergen, Palo Alto, CA.. For all of the studies described, SELDI analysis was performed using a hydrophobic H4 protein chip w ZCiphergene.. The H4 chip contains a long-chain aliphatic surface that binds proteins by reverse phase interaction. Three to five microliters of sample diluted in distilled water were applied to a spot on an H4 chip

and allowed to air dry, then washed with 3 ml of H 2 0 and allowed dry. To the dry spot, 0.5 ml of an EAM was added. The EAM consisted of a saturated solution of 3.5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic or Sinapinic acid ZSigma. 50% Acetonitrile and 0.5% Trifluoracetic acid. EAM was added and allowed to air dry. Once dry, a second application of EAM solution was added and allowed to crystallize. The sample was transferred to the Ciphergen SELDI reader and analyzed following desorption of bound proteins by short intense probes from an N2 320 nm-UV laser. The profile of bound proteins was determined by time-of-flight in a mass spectrometer ZSELDI-TOF..

3. Results 3.1. Analysis of acti’e and zymogen SpeB by SELDITOF The use of SELDI coupled with a TOF mass spectrometry read-out provides a new approach for the rapid analysis of proteins. This proteomic system is highly sensitive and has facilitated analysis of biomarkers in urine and other biological fluids with minimal sample preparation and using microliter volumes of sample ZYip et al., 1996; Merchant and Weinberger, 2000; Paweletz et al., 2000; Wright et al., 2000.. In evaluating the usefulness of this technology for analyzing secreted bacterial virulence factors, we have focused on a model system utilizing the S. pyogenes cysteine protease SpeB. Initially, a preparation of either the zymogen form of SpeB or activated SpeB Z; 5 mg., prepared as described in Section 2, was analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In addition, enzymatic activity was measured using a synthetic substrate assay ZNorth, 1994.. A single band of Mr ; 41,000 was seen in the zymogen preparations on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel ZFig. 1A. while the active preparation migrated as a single Mr ; 28,500 band ZFig. 1A.. After Western blotting and immunostaining with anti-SpeB polyclonal antibody, a single antigenic Mr ; 41,000 protein was detected in the zymogen preparation and a single Mr ; 28,500 band was visualized in the active enzyme preparation ZFig. 1B.. Minimal cysteine protease activity was

detected in samples containing the zymogen protein; while as expected, the active enzyme cleaved the cysteine protease synthetic substrate, Bz-Pro-PheArg-Nan ZFig. 1C.. This data is consistent with the previously reported properties of enzymatically active and zymogen forms of SpeB ZElliot, 1945; Liu and Elliot, 1965a,b; French et al., 1990; Raeder et al., 1998.. The same samples were analyzed by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Three microliters of a 1:100 dilution of each sample Z; 0.75 ng of protein. was applied to separate spots of a Ciphergen H4 hydrophic chip. The H4 chip was washed with water as described in Section 2 and bound proteins analyzed in the Ciphergen SELDI reader. The zymogen form of the protein had a single peak with a molecular mass of 41,200 Da " 100, while the active form of the enzyme had a predominant peak at 28,500 " 100 ZFig. 2.. Based on the known primary amino acid sequence of SpeB ZHauser and Schlievert, 1990., the multiple peaks around the major 28,500 Da peak are most likely attributable to enzymatic processing of 1 to 3 N or C terminal amino acids during the autoactivation reaction. Based on the nucleotide sequence of SpeB for one group A isolate, the predicted molecu-

lar weight of the zymogen with the putative signal sequence removed was 40,314 and the active protein had a predicted molecular weight of 27,588 ZHauser and Schlievert, 1990.. 3.2. Kinetics of SpeB production in culture Using the conditions established above, the next series of studies were designed to monitor secretion of SpeB as a function of cell growth. SpeB expression is growth phase regulated and is first expressed in the late logarithmic growth phase ZChaussee et al., 1997.. The SpeB-secreting isolate 64 was grown in Todd≠Hewitt broth at 378C without shaking. Growth was monitored by measuring the change in OD550 of the culture over time ZFig. 3A. and samples were removed at 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post-inoculation for analysis. Five microliters of culture supernatant were analyzed directly by SELDI-TOF using an H4 hydrophobic clip as described in Section 2. There was no detectable SpeB, either zymogen or active, prior to 12 h in culture Zdata not shown.. At 12 h post inoculation, the zymogen and active forms of SpeB were detectable by SELDI-TOF ZFig. 3B.. By 16 h, the majority of SpeB was in the active,

Three-microliter samples of a 1:100 dilution of the same protein samples characterized in Fig. 1 were applied to separate spots on an H4-hydrophobic protein chip. Following drying and addition of EAM, the protein profile of the samples were determined using a Ciphergen SELDI reader. The upper panel represents the profile of zymogen SpeB and the lower panel demonstrates the protein profile of the fully active enzyme.

processed form ZFig. 3B.. The amount of SpeB decreased at later times ZFig. 3B.. The shift from the zymogen to the active form of SpeB between 12 and 16 h was probably due to a drop in pH of the culture media ZpH 7.0 to 6.0. permitting autoactivation. Autoactivation of SpeB could be prevented by growing the bacteria in culture media containing the cysteine protease inhibitor E64. The kinetics of SpeB production was not altered by the presence of the cysteine protease inhibitor Zdata not shown.. 3.3. Analysis of SpeB q and SpeB y S. pyogenes ’ariants Previous studies from our laboratory showed that after nine passages of isolate 64 in human blood, two colony variants could be selected that differed in capsule morphology and secretion of SpeB. Large mucoid colonies were found to be SpeBy and small colonies were SpeBq ZRaeder et al., 2000.. The production of SpeB in culture supernatants of small and large colony variants of isolate 64p were analyzed by SELDI-TOF using H4 hydrophobic protein chips and 5 ml of sample. Following 18 h incubation

at 378C in Todd≠Hewitt broth at 378C, no SpeB was detected in culture media from the large colony variant while the culture fluid from the small colony variant contained the 28,500-Da active SpeB enzyme ZFig. 4.. These results confirm an association between capsule morphology and SpeB production for isolate 64 ZRaeder et al., 2000.. 3.4. Analysis of autoacti’ation of SpeB Based on the results above, SELDI-TOF analysis provided a rapid, sensitive and precise method for distinguishing between the zymogen and active forms of the S. pyogenes cysteine protease SpeB. Kinetic studies of autoactivation were performed to determine if this approach could identify intermediates generated during autocatalysis. For these experiments, SpeB zymogen was prepared by growing isolate 64p for 18 h at 378C in Todd≠Hewitt broth containing 10 mM E64. The culture supernatants were diluted 1:10 in H 2 O without E64 and samples were taken at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min. Further enzymatic activity was prevented by the addition of E64 to a final concen-

tration of 10 mM. When harvested, 3 ml of each sample were applied to an H4 chip and the protein profile of the preparations analyzed by SELDI-TOF. A sequential loss of the SpeB zymogen and the appearance of a series of intermediates were detected ZFig. 5.. Following 1 min incubation without E64, four intermediates were apparent. Within 2 min, the

majority of the enzyme was fully activated and the first intermediate was converted into two forms that were present in all preparations analyzed thereafter Zsee Fig. 5.. By 3 min at 378C, the maximum yield of the fully active form of the protein had accumulated. The activation intermediates identified by the kinetic analysis shown in Fig. 5 corresponded to

The protein profiles demonstrate a sequential process of autoactivation and lead to the identification of a number of defined intermediates, see Table 1.

those previously reported by Doran et al. Z1999. using MALDI analysis of highly purified zymogen SpeB undergoing autoactivation under controlled conditions Zsee Table 1.. The subtle differences in the size of the zymogen proteins and intermediate shown for the two isolates in Table 1 most probably represent differences in the gene encoding SpeB in each isolate or to minor differences in the calibration of the instruments. It should be emphasized, however, that our analysis utilized unpurified SpeB secreted into bacterial culture media, while the analysis of Doran et al. used a preparation that had been extensively purified.

4. Discussion In this study, we have analyzed an important secreted virulence factor of S. pyogenes the cysteine protease, SpeB ZKapur et al., 1994; Burns et al., 1998; Lukomski et al., 1998, 1999.. The studies have focused on the use of SELDI coupled with TOF mass spectrometry. Analysis of the role of SpeB in pathogenesis has been difficult for a number of reasons. First, the enzyme can exist in two forms, an Mr ; 41,000 zymogen which undergoes autocataly-

sis to yield an Mr ; 28,500 fully active cysteine protease ZElliot, 1945; Liu and Elliot, 1965a,b; French et al., 1990; Berge and Bjorck, 1995; Raeder et al., 1998, 2000.. Second, its expression is influenced by the nutrient environment ZPodbielski and Leonard, 1998; Podbielski et al., 1999. growth-phase regulated and it is secreted at the highest concentration during late logarithmic phase of culture ZChaussee et al., 1997, 1999.. In addition, SpeB can post-translationally modify andror destroy other secreted and surface-associated bacterial products making it difficult to distinguish between direct and indirect effects of SpeB in pathogenesis ZElliot, 1945; Berge and Bjorck, 1995; Shanley et al., 1996; Raeder et al., 1998, 2000.. We have demonstrated that SpeB can be readily detected in - 5 ml samples of 1:100 dilutions of culture supernatants Zapproximately 0.75 ng of protein. using SELDI-TOF compared to 5 mg of protein for the Western immunoblot analysis. The sensitivity of this method allows SpeB to be detected in culture supernatants without any pre-concentration step being required. This enables a sample to be collected and assayed in is less than 30 min. The speed and sensitivity of this assay is much greater than current methods involving SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting and is significantly more economic in the quantities of reagents required. Furthermore, the protein profiles obtained using the SELDI system are more precise in determining heterogeneity than the corresponding SDS-PAGE techniques. Analysis of the area under the peaks in the mass spectral tracers suggests that the method may also be used to provide a semi-quantitative measure of SpeB Zdata not shown.. Using the SELDI-TOF analysis, we have confirmed previous reports that SpeB secretion is growth phase dependent ZChaussee et al., 1997; Podbielski and Leonard, 1998; Podbielski et al., 1999.. In addition, we could rapidly distinguish differences between SpeB positive and negative isogenic variants ZRaeder et al., 2000. and confirm that these differences related to absence of secretion of the zymogen form of SpeB and not related to the failure of autocatalytic activation that has been noted in some studies ZCollin and Olsen, 2000.. In addition to readily distinguishing between the zymogen and activated forms of the enzyme, we

were also able to demonstrate the presence of four sequential intermediates associated with the conversion of the zymogen to the fully activated enzyme, see Fig. 5 and Table 1. The ability to distinguish these intermediates had only been achieved previously with highly purified zymogen preparations using sensitive MALDI spot mass-spectral analysis ZDoran et al., 1999.. The ability to monitor these activation events in culture media offers additional opportunities for studying the activation process under varying conditions of temperature and pH that could pertain at different sites of infection. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that SELDI-TOF is a significant technological advance in studying bacterial proteins, particularly those that are subjected to post-translational modification. In addition, the availability of protein chips with different surface chemistries Ze.g., anionic and cationic. will allow rapid on-chip purification of proteins from complex mixtures prior to SELDI-TOF analysis ZYip et al., 1996; Merchant and Weinberger, 2000; Paweletz et al., 2000; Wright et al., 2000.. The speed, sensitivity and reproducibility of the results suggest that SELDI-TOF protein chip technology will be of great value at the interface between genomics and proteomics. It will also help in the analysis of post-translational processing of proteins which currently cannot be accurately predicted from sequence data alone.
