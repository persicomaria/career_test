Targeting death receptors in cancer with Apo2L/TRAIL
Sean K KelleyÃ and Avi Ashkenazi
Unlike conventional cancer therapeutics, death receptor ligands trigger tumor cell apoptosis independently of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which frequently is inactivated in cancer. The death receptor ligand Apo2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) offers promising therapeutic potential based on its ability to induce apoptosis in various cancer cell lines with little toxicity toward normal cells. Moreover, Apo2L/TRAIL displays single-agent activity and cooperates with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in a variety of tumor xenograft mouse models. Thus, Apo2L/TRAIL might be effective against tumors that have acquired resistance to conventional therapy, and could augment the efficacy of current treatment in a wide spectrum of cancers.

ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) is one of several members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene superfamily that induce apoptosis through engagement of death receptors (DRs; reviewed in [1]). Attempts to develop DR-targeted agents such as recombinant soluble TNF or agonistic anti-Fas (CD95) antibodies for cancer therapy have been hindered by issues of safety (reviewed in [2]). However, accumulating evidence suggests that Apo2L/TRAIL may hold better promise. In vitro findings demonstrate preferential apoptosisinducing activity of optimized recombinant soluble Apo2L/TRAIL against cancer cells when compared with normal cells [2,3]. In vivo studies reveal significant antitumor efficacy of Apo2L/TRAIL in various tumor xenograft models. Furthermore, safety studies in non-human primates show that Apo2L/TRAIL administration at relatively high doses is well tolerated, and pharmcokinetic studies suggest that therapeutically relevant doses of this protein may be achievable in humans [3,4]. Such findings have fueled continued interest in Apo2L/TRAIL as a potential agent for clinical investigation in cancer therapy. In this article, we provide an overview of the Apo2L/ TRAIL molecule and its mechanism of action as an apoptosis-inducing ligand. We discuss some recent clues to the physiological role of Apo2L/TRAIL, and explain the scientific rationale for its further study as an anticancer agent.

Apo2L/TRAIL and its receptor system
Apo2L/TRAIL was discovered by virtue of its structural homology to members of the TNF gene superfamily [5,6]. Apo2L/TRAIL shares 28% amino acid sequence identity with Fas ligand and 23% identity with TNF. Native Apo2L/TRAIL is expressed as a type II transmembrane protein (N-terminal located in the cell interior and C-terminal on the exterior), and its extracellular region can be cleaved proteolytically to release a soluble molecule. Crystallographic studies on soluble Apo2L/ TRAIL reveal a homotrimeric molecule, stabilized by an internal zinc atom that is coordinated to three cysteine residues, one at position 230 of each ligand subunit [7]. The receptor system for Apo2LTRAIL is complex and comprises four exclusive receptors (Figure 1). Two of these -- DR4 (TRAIL receptor-1) and DR5 (TRAIL receptor-2, KILLER, TRICK2) -- are DRs which contain a cytoplasmic death domain that is able to transduce an apoptotic signal. By contrast, two other receptors, decoy receptor (DcR)1 (TRAIL receptor-3, TRIDD, LIT), which lacks an intracellular death domain, and

Introduction
Surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy remain the dominant weapons in the arsenal for the treatment of cancer. However, these approaches are rarely curative and are often limited by undesirable toxicities and the selective proliferation of treatment-resistant tumor cells. Biological therapies might lead the next front in the battle against cancer, as many hold promise of selectively targeting tumors while minimizing toxic side effects, as well as circumventing or overcoming acquired tumor resistance against conventional treatments.

Apo2L/TRAIL and its receptors. Apo2L/TRAIL is a homotrimeric ligand that interacts with four closely related members of the TNF receptor superfamily. DR4 and DR5 contain a cytoplasmic death domain and signal apoptosis; DcR1 is linked to the plasma membrane by a glycophosphatidylinositol moiety and lacks signaling activity; DcR2 has a truncated non-functional death domain. OPG, a soluble more distantly related receptor, is capable of binding weakly to Apo2L/TRAIL, although the physiological significance of its interaction with this ligand is unclear. Unlike conventional cancer therapeutics, DR ligands trigger tumor cell apoptosis independently of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which frequently is inactivated in cancer. Thus, Apo2L/TRAIL might be effective against tumors that have acquired resistance to conventional therapy, and may augment the efficacy of current treatment in a wide spectrum of cancers. DISC, death inducing signaling complex; FADD, Fas-associated death domain.

DcR2 (TRAIL receptor-4, TRUNDD), which contains a truncated non-functional death domain, are unable to initiate apoptotic cell death and are believed to act as decoys. Although another TNF family receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG), binds Apo2L/TRAIL with low affinity, this interaction appears to be of minimal physiological significance. In the mouse, only a single receptor resembling human DR4 and DR5 exists, along with two DcRs that are only distantly related by sequence to human DcR1 and DcR2, and one close homologue of OPG [2,8]. The human and murine Apo2L/TRAIL proteins share 65% sequence identity. In contrast, human and cynomolgus monkey Apo2L/TRAIL are 98% homologous, and the receptor ectodomain sequence identity is 91% for DR4, 88% for DR5, 84% for DcR2, and 99% for OPG, whereas cynoCurrent Opinion in Pharmacology 2004, 4:333­339

molgus DcR1 appears to be a pseudogene [3]. Indeed, human Apo2L/TRAIL binds with similar affinity to human and cynomolgus death receptors (Kd ¼ 0.5 Æ 0.2 nM). The chimpanzee has homologs of DR4, DR5, DcR1, DcR2 and OPG, with sequence identities ranging from 97% to 99% of the human counterparts. Additionally, human Apo2L/TRAIL is capable of inducing apoptosis in the rhesus mammary tumor cell line CMMT110 and the transformed baboon lymphoblastoid cell line CB1, further supporting its cross-reactivity with nonhuman primate death receptors. Thus, monkeys provide a more optimal model than rodents for preclinical safety assessment of human Apo2L/TRAIL.

Activation of the cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic apoptosis pathways by Apo2L/TRAIL. The cell-extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway (engaged through DRs) and cell-intrinsic pathway (triggered through the Bcl-2 gene superfamily) are represented. Engagement of the cell-extrinsic pathway by Apo2L/TRAIL is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in some cell types, whereas in other cell types amplification of this pathway through the intrinsic pathway is needed to commit the cell to apoptosis. Crosstalk between these two pathways involves cleavage of Bid and subsequent activation of Bax and Bak. In certain cancer cells, Bax is absolutely required to connect the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways; if the cells have DNA mismatch repair deficiency, Bax is readily lost through mutation, which renders the cells resistant to Apo2L/TRAIL. However, the resistance associated with Bax inactivation can be circumvented by pre-exposing the cells to chemotherapy, which upregulates levels of DR5 and Bak.

apoptosis pathway (reviewed in [9]) (Figure 2). Upon binding of Apo2L/TRAIL, DR4 and DR5 can each recruit and activate the apoptosis-initiating proteases caspase-8 and caspase-10 through the death-domain-containing adaptor molecule Fas-associated death domain. Caspase-8 and -10 in turn activate `effector' caspases, such as caspase-3, -6 and -7, which execute the cell's apoptotic demise. In some cancer cell lines, Apo2L/ TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-3 is further augmented through engagement of the cell-intrinsic apoptosis pathway [10,11,12]. In this case, caspase-8 or caspase-10 cleaves and activates the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid, which then interacts with two other pro-apoptotic family members, Bax and Bak, to induce the release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from mitochondria. Cytochrome c, together with Apaf-1, activates the initiator protease caspase-9, which contributes to further activation of caspase-3, -6 and -7. Smac/Diablo binds to inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as X-chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP), preventing the IAPs from physically binding caspase-3, hence promoting further casapse-3 activation.

TRAIL cDNA reveal a single mRNA transcript of approximately 2 kb. Apo2L/TRAIL mRNA is detected in many human tissues, including fetal lung, liver and kidney, and adult spleen, prostate, thymus, ovary, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood leukocytes, heart, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle and kidney. Antigen-dependent activation of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells from peripheral blood induces expression of Apo2L/TRAIL mRNA, as does stimulation of macrophages with interferon (IFN)-g. There is evidence for involvement of Apo2L/TRAIL in target-killing by cytotoxic CD4þ T lymphocytes. Further data suggest that Apo2L/TRAIL plays a role in tumor cell killing by natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. Studies with Apo2L/TRAIL gene knockout mice confirm a role for Apo2L/TRAIL in antitumor immune surveillance by NK cells, specifically in host defense against tumor initiation and metastasis [13,14,15]. Additionally, tumor cells from cancer patients activate macrophages to produce Apo2L/TRAIL, and these macrophages can release molecules that induce increased expression of DR4 and DR5 on tumor cells [16]. Chronic blockade of Apo2L/TRAIL in mice exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (models of human rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, respectively) [17,18]. Apo2L/ TRAIL deficiency also increases the susceptibility of mice to autoimmune arthritis and diabetes, in connection with reduced control over thymocyte apoptosis and

Physiological role for Apo2L/TRAIL
The biological role of Apo2L/TRAIL is not fully understood; however, the ligand's ability to trigger apoptosis in a variety of transformed cell lines suggests that it may be a physiological modulator of tumor cell apoptosis [2]. Northern blot analyses with probes based on Apo2L/

increased cellular and humoral immune responses against self-antigens [19]. However, the role of Apo2L/TRAIL in intrathymic negative selection remains controversial, as others have found that the ligand is not required for this process [20]. Apo2L/TRAIL also might play a role in the early phases of IFN-dependent host defense against viral infection. IFNs inhibit virus replication by activating apoptosis in infected cells and by inducing an anti-viral state in neighboring, uninfected cells. The Apo2L/TRAIL gene is subject to regulation by IFNs (reviewed in [21]). In response to IFN-g, cytomegalovirus-infected human fibroblasts become sensitive to Apo2L/TRAIL killing, while uninfected neighboring cells upregulate their Apo2L/TRAIL expression and downregulate their death receptors. In mice challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus, infected cells, but not uninfected cells, are susceptible to Apo2L/TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro; Apo2L/TRAIL expression by NK cells is crucial for limiting virus replication in vivo. Similarly, rous sarcoma virus-infected mouse cells are susceptible in vivo to killing through the Apo2L/TRAIL pathway by immune cells such as NK and CD4þ T cells that carry membrane-bound Apo2L/TRAIL [22]. Furthermore, Apo2L/TRAIL induces apoptosis in vitro in virusinfected hepatocytes isolated from livers of patients with hepatitis infection, and in vivo in mouse models of adenoviral hepatitis. These findings indicate that Apo2L/ TRAIL, particularly in its membrane-associated form, may be critical for defense mechanisms that eliminate infected cells and limit viral replication [23]. Consistent with this, adenoviruses inhibit Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis by inducing internalization of DR5 [24], suggesting that certain viruses may prevent infected cells from apoptotic suicide by suppressing the Apo2L/ TRAIL pathway. In summary, although the biological role of Apo2L/ TRAIL is not fully understood, increasing evidence suggests that this apoptosis-inducing ligand may be an important player in immune surveillance against oncogenically transformed and virally-infected cells. In addition, Apo2L/TRAIL might function to attenuate autoimmune reactions.

Despite these potential advantages, clinical application of the prototypic DR ligands TNF and CD95L has been hampered by toxicity to normal tissues [2]. Intravenous TNF administration causes hypotension and a systemic inflammatory syndrome that resembles septic shock by activating the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor-kB in vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. Injection of agonist anti-Fas (CD95) antibodies induces hepatocyte apoptosis and lethal hepatic failure in mice. The ability of Apo2L/TRAIL to induce apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cell lines, while having little toxicity toward many types of normal cells, suggests that this molecule may be useful for cancer therapy. Although concerns about the safety of Apo2L/TRAIL have appropriately been raised, careful studies show that toxicity of this ligand toward normal cells is associated with recombinant variants of the protein that possess aberrant structural and biochemical properties. Optimized recombinant soluble human Apo2L/TRAIL preparations that yield a stable zinc-bound 60 kDa homotrimeric molecule, closely resembling the endogenous soluble ligand [7,25], are able to induce apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cell lines, including cell lines derived from colon, lung, breast, prostate, pancreas, kidney, central nervous system and thyroid cancer, as well as lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma [2,26]. In contrast, the zinc-coordinated soluble Apo2L/TRAIL protein induced little apoptosis in normal cell types, including epithelial, endothelial, fibroblastic, smooth muscle or astrocytic cells [26,27], as well as hepatocytes [3] and keratinocytes [28]. Conversely, some non-optimized Apo2L/TRAIL preparations have been associated with apoptosis-inducing activity against normal cells (e.g. hepatocytes). The following are two examples of preparations with this activity: a version containing an Nterminal polyhistidine tag and having poor zinc coordination and aberrant subunit association [3,29]; and a form containing an N-terminal Flag epitope tag and crosslinked with an anti-Flag antibody [25]. Therefore, the risk for in vivo hepatotoxicity might be greatly reduced by vigilantly selecting optimized non-toxic recombinant protein preparations. Indeed, relatively high doses of optimized recombinant soluble Apo2L/TRAIL (several orders of magnitude greater than TNF doses that cause severe toxicity) are well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys and chimpanzees [3,4]. The majority of cancer cell lines and about 50 primary human tumor specimens studied to date, including samples from colon, lung, and breast cancer, were found by immunohistochemical staining to express DR4 and/or DR5. Non-clinical efficacy studies in rodent xenograft models of colon cancer [4,10,26,30,31], breast cancer [32,33], glioma [27,34,35], prostate cancer [36], multiple myeloma [37], and lung cancer (Ashkenazi et al., unpublished; see Now in Press) demonstrate that Apo2L/

Scientific rationale for therapeutic approach
DR ligands are potentially useful for cancer therapy because, unlike many conventional cancer therapeutic agents, they can trigger tumor cell apoptosis independently of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is inactivated in more than half of human cancers. Hence, DR ligands could be effective against tumors that have acquired resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In addition, they might be useful in combination with conventional therapies against tumors that retain at least partial sensitivity to chemotherapy or radiation.

TRAIL, administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, shows substantial anti-tumor activity. This activity is evidenced by significant apoptosis in tumors, partial (and in some cases complete) tumor shrinkage, and delayed (or in some cases undetectable) tumor progression. The potential for Apo2L/TRAIL to act synergistically with other anti-cancer therapies is particularly compelling. Recently, Apo2L/TRAIL has been shown to act synergistically when combined with IFN-g [38], genotoxic agents (e.g. doxorubicin, cisplatin or etoposide) [39­44], irinotecan [4,10,26,30,31,36], g-radiation [32,45] and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors [46]. The underlying mechanisms behind this synergy vary between therapies but include DR upregulation, modulation of Bcl-2 family members, caspase upregulation, and inhibition of IAP family members or c-FLIP (cellular FLICE/caspase-8inhibitory protein). In anticipation of clinical trials with Apo2L/TRAIL, studies were conducted to support intravenous dose administration and to predict the disposition of Apo2L/ TRAIL in humans [4]. High Apo2L/TRAIL doses were administered to nude mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys and chimpanzees. Apo2L/TRAIL was rapidly eliminated from the serum of all species studied. Half-lives were 3À5 min in rodents and 24À31 min in non-human primates. Apo2L/TRAIL clearance was highly correlated with glomerular filtration rate across species, consistent with data from tissue distribution studies (Xiang et al., unpublished) indicating that the kidneys play a critical role in the elimination of this molecule. Given the antitumor activity observed in vivo, it is likely that Apo2L/ TRAIL is capable of significant tumor penetration despite its rapid renal clearance; however, this has yet to be demonstrated directly. In summary, Apo2L/TRAIL targets a wide range of tumor cell types and appears to have distinct safety advantages over other DR ligands. Additionally, combination of Apo2L/TRAIL with established chemotherapies or ionizing radiation has the potential to enhance the activity of either modality and perhaps overcome the resistance of some tumor cells to therapy. Furthermore, Apo2L/TRAIL has pharmacokinetic properties that are compatible with clinical application.

The mechanisms underlying preferential killing of tumor cells over normal cells by Apo2L/TRAIL are not fully clear. One aspect might involve DcR1 and DcR2, which act as `decoy' receptors following ectopic overexpression in cells that contain DR4 and DR5. Decoy receptor mRNAs are expressed in various normal tissues, and there is evidence supporting a protective role for these receptors in certain non-neoplastic cells [2]. BTK-143 osteosarcoma cells acquire progressive resistance to Apo2L/ TRAIL treatment by upregulating DcR2 [40]. However, in most cancer cell lines, DR4 and/or DR5 are expressed, whereas DcR expression is less frequent and does not appear to correlate with resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL. Thus, there are probably additional determinants of sensitivity besides receptor expression. One such factor might be cFLIP, a caspase-8- and caspase-10-related molecule that lacks catalytic activity and acts as a competitive inhibitor of DR-mediated apoptosis [47,48]. Another factor is XIAP, a member of the IAP family that binds directly to caspase-3 and -9 and can also inhibit their processing [9,49,50]. Although direct induction of DRmediated signaling through activation of caspase-3 by caspase-8 and -10 can be sufficient for apoptosis in some cell types, others require amplification of this extrinsic pathway through activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, sensitivity of cells to Apo2L/TRAIL might also hinge on a balance between pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bax and Bak) or anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL) members of the Bcl-2 family. Cross-talk between intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways is mediated through cleavage of Bid by caspase-8. Truncated Bid interacts with Bax and Bak, which facilitate mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. In gene ablation studies of HCT116 cells, Bax was not required for Apo2L/TRAIL-induced death inducing signal complex formation, caspase-8 activation or Bid cleavage. However, Bax was necessary for mitochondrial depolarization, cytochome c release, caspase-9 activation and, ultimately, Apo2L/TRAIL-induced cell death [10,11,12]. Thus, in certain cells, engaging both the intrinsic (through Bax) and extrinsic pathways is important for Apo2L/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In summary, a balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors that exist at the cell-surface and within the cell determines susceptibility to Apo2L/TRAIL-induced cell death. A better understanding of this relationship will facilitate identification of patients whose tumors might be most sensitive to Apo2L/TRAIL therapy. Moreover, defining the mechanisms that permit tumor cells to acquire resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL will be helpful in developing strategies that maximize the potential effectiveness of this agent in clinical application.

Control of sensitivity to Apo2L/TRAIL
Apo2L/TRAIL induces apoptosis in several tumor cell lines, but is non-toxic to normal cells, particularly in its zinc-optimized, soluble trimeric form. Apo2L/TRAIL mRNA is constitutively expressed in many human tissues. DR4 and DR5 mRNAs are also expressed in many normal tissues, suggesting the existence of physiological mechanisms that protect normal cells from Apo2L/ TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Apo2L/TRAIL is a member of the TNF gene superfamily that is able to induce apoptosis through binding of two cell-surface DRs (DR4 and DR5). Apo2L/TRAIL

directly engages the cell-extrinsic apoptotis pathway through recruitment of the death inducing signal complex and activation of initiator caspases, which activate effector caspases that ultimately execute programmed cell death. Apo2L/TRAIL can also engage the intrinsic apoptosis pathway through caspase-dependent activation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Although the endogenous role of Apo2L/TRAIL has yet to be fully resolved, recent evidence suggests that it may be important in immune surveillance against oncogene-transformed and virus-infected cells. Optimized zinc-coordinated recombinant soluble human Apo2L/TRAIL, closely resembling the endogenous soluble ligand, induces apoptosis in a wide variety of human cancer cell lines, yet leaves normal cells unharmed. This is probably the result of a differential balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, both at the cell surface (DRs and DcRs) and perhaps more importantly within the cell (Bax, Bak, Bcl-2/XL, XIAP, cFLIP). In cancer xenograft rodent models, Apo2L/ TRAIL displays single-agent anti-tumor activity and cooperates with various chemotherapy agents or radiotherapy. Further studies in non-human primates show that functionally relevant doses of Apo2L/TRAIL are well tolerated and should be achievable in humans. Taken together, these findings suggest that Apo2L/ TRAIL has distinct safety advantages over other TNF family members, and therefore provide a novel approach to targeting DR-induced apoptosis in tumors and for advancing current treatment strategies in a wide range of human cancers.
