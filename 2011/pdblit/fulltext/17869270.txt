SUMMARY

High levels of active HIV-1 protease (PR) were produced in Escherichiu coli, amounting to S-10% of total cell protein. High production levels were achieved by altering the following parameters: (1) codon preference of the coding region, (2) A+T-richness at the 5' end of the coding region, and (3) promoter. To circumvent the toxicity of HIV-l PR in E. coli, the gene was expressed as a fusion protein with two different proteolytic autocleavage sequences. In both the cases, the fusion protein could be cleaved in vivo to give an active molecule with the native sequence at the N terminus.

INTRODUCTION

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent for AIDS and related diseases (Wong-Staal and Gallo, 1985). The HIV retrovirus genome is approx. 10 kb in size and contains gag, pol and env genes flanked by long terminal repeats. The pal gene consists of PR, reverse transcriptase and integrase coding regions (Ratner et al., 1987).

Proteins of the retroviruses are synthesized in the form of a polyprotein precursor which is subsequently processed by specific virus-encoded PRs (Krausslich and Wimmer, 1988). These enzymes have a highly conserved sequence, Asp-Thr-Gly, which is characteristic of aspartyl PRs (Pearl and Taylor, 1987). In the case of HIV-l, it has been demonstrated that the PR encoded by the 5' portion of the pol gene is responsible for the proteolytic processing of the gag and gag-pal polyproteins at specific cleavage sites to yield mature capsid proteins and the enzymes, PR, reverse transcriptase and integrase (Leis et al., 1988). HIV-l PR has been shown to be necessary for viral replication, since deletion of the portion of the gene encoding PR or mutation in its active site (Asp+Asn) resulted in non-infectious virions (Crawford and Goff, 1985; Kohl et al., 1988). These results indicate that HIV-l PR may be a good target for designing inhibitors which could be used in combating AIDS. Many groups have shown that the HIV-l PR activity could be blocked in vitro using synthetic peptides (Billich et al., 1988; Krausslich et al., 1989; Tomasselli et al., 1990). It has also been shown that the HIV-l replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes could be inhibited by a synthetic HIV-l PR inhibitor (McQuade et al., 1990). Several groups have described bacterial production of

264

HIV-l PR which was produced by autocatalytic processing of a larger precursor ar by fusions with either fl-galactosidase, dihydrofolate reductase, or p-lactamase (Giam and Boros, 1988; Hansen et al., 1988; Hostomsky et al., 1989; Loeb et al., 1989; Korant and Rizzo, 1990). In most cases, the expression levels were low and the protein could only be detected by immunoblotting. This report describes the comparison of a number of strategies for achieving high-level accumulation of HIV- 1 PR in E. coli.

RESULTS

AND DISCUSSION

(a) Effect of synthetic gene on expression of HIV-1 PR Initial attempts at producing active HIV-l PR in E. coli using a cDNA clone resulted in very low levels of HIV-l PR which could only be detected by Western blot using HIV-l PR antibody. In addition, the E. coli cells grew poorly (data not shown). The cDNA clone (pMON5822) consisted of a BgZII -NcoI DNA fragment containing the polgene from the recombinant phage HXB2 (Ratner et al., 1987) in an expression plasmid described in Table I. Some of the possible reasons for poor expression included (I) the flanking region sequences (part of the pal gene), (2) the toxicity of PR, or, (3) the effect of numerous rare codons on expression in E. coli. To circumvent the possible problems of the flanking regions (which contained coding regions for reverse transcriptase and integrase) and the rare codons, synthetic HIV-l PR genes with E. coli-preferred codons were assembled, having either Met-Ala-Pro or Met-Pro sequences at their N-termini. These synthetic genes were cloned in expression vectors with the glO-L RBS and either the recA or ZucUV5 promoter, as shown in Table I. Plasmid constructs were also made by replacing the first nine codons in the synthetic gene with A+T-rich codons as shown in Table I. When a synthetic gene was used, a band corresponding to the HIV- 1 PR could be seen on a Coomassie-stained gel, and the intensity was stronger when a gene with A+T-rich codons was used. The results using Met-Ala-Pro constructs are shown in Fig. 2. Similar results were obtained with constructs encoding Met-Pro aa at the N terminus of the PR gene (data not shown). These results were confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against HIV-l PR. Overall, the use of a synthetic gene with A+T-rich codons resulted in an approx. 50- to lOO-fold increase in the levels of HIV-l PR production, relative to the level obtained using a cDNA coding region.

Plasmid pMON5822 contains a BglII-NcoI fragment (treated with PolIk) of phage HXB2 (Ratner et al., 1987) cloned into pMON5766 at the NcoI site (treated with PolIk). pMON5823 is a deletion of pal gene in pMON5822 between EcoRV sites, which deletes all of the integrase region and part of reverse transcriptase. All of the other plasmids mentioned above used synthetic gene shown in Fig. 1, cloned in the expression vector pMON5766.

proved by replacing the recA promoter with the lacUV5 promoter. The results are shown in Fig. 2, lanes C (pMON5863) and D (pMON5868). Although the expression levels seem similar, the overall production level was far better with expression driven by the lucUV5 promoter, since strains carrying the expression plasmid with the recA promoter grew very poorly (data not shown). We suspect that small amounts of soluble, active HIV-l PR are expressed in cells containing plasmids using the recA promoter even under non-inducing conditions. This material may be toxic to E. coli, making the cells less capable of producing high levels of HIV-l PR on induction. In the case of the lacUV5 promoter, which is more tightly repressed than the recA promoter, no HIV-l PR is made until the promoter is induced. Upon induction, large amounts of HIV-1 PR are made, which precipitates into an insoluble form (inclusion bodies) where it is presumably inactive, and hence has no toxic effect on the E. coli cells. (c) Effect of N-terminal sequence on the activity of HIV-l PR (Met-Ala-Pro versus Met-Pro) Depending on the gene used, the activity of the HIV-l PR recovered from inclusion bodies (after refolding) differed greatly, even though the accumulation levels were very similar. Higher activity of the PR could be recovered using plasmid constructs encoding Met-Pro (pMON5879)

at the N terminus of the gene compared to the gene with Met-Ala-Pro (pMON5878), where no activity was detected. There seems to be a correlation between the PR activity and the fraction of protein with Pro as the first aa. The sequencing results obtained from HIV-l PR protein expressed using pMON5878 (PR gene sequence starts with Met-Ala-Pro) showed that 50% of the protein contained Met and 50% contained Ala at the N terminus, with none containing Pro. In contrast, using pMON5879 (PR gene sequence starts with Met-Pro) 90% of the protein had Pro

at its N terminus. It has been observed in E. coli with a number of proteins, that the N-terminal Met is processed off efficiently by methionine aminopeptidase, especially when the second aa is Ala (Easton et al., 1991). Using pMON5863 (PR gene sequence starts with Met-Ala-Pro) the expression levels were low, and PR activity could be detected in the soluble fraction of cell extracts. In contrast, using pMON5878 (PR gene sequence starts with Met-AlaPro) expression levels were high, but no activity was detected. These results could be explained as follows. It has been observed that aminopeptidase P present in E. coli cleaves prior to Pro residues (Yaron and Mlynar, 1968) but that cleavage is much slower when the aa preceding Pro is Ala (Yaron and Berger, 1970). In the case of pMON5863, where the HIV-l PR expression level was very low and the protein was soluble, it is possible that Met and Ala were more efficiently cleaved off, whereas in the case of pMON5878, the high-level expression resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies where the protein was insoluble, and therefore possibly not accessible to aminopeptidases. As mentioned earlier, HIV- 1 PR with an N-terminal Pro is active, while proteins with Met-Ala or Ala extensions are inactive. These results are consistent with the observation

that the structure of HIV-l PR requires the formation of a homodimer for its activity (Guenet et al., 1989). The crystal structure of HIV-l PR shows that the dimer involves the N and C termini of the protein forming a p-sheet as illustrated in Fig. 3. The presence of additional aa residues at the N (or the C) terminus could inhibit dimer formation by inducing the adjoining residues to adopt conformations which are not b-strands. Alternatively, extra residues could shift the registration of the inter-strand hydrogen bonds in a manner which would preclude formation of a stable, active dimer. A final possibility is that additional residues at the terminus of one chain could interact with residues in the central chain segment of the other, in a manner which destabilizes productive dimer formation. (d) Synthesis of HIV-l PR as a fusion Since a Pro residue at the N-terminal position of the PR seems to be important for its activity, a strategy was devised to produce homogenous material starting with Pro. From our results expressing the complete pal gene (pMON5863) in E. coli and from other reports (Giam and Boros, 1988; Hansen et al., 1988; Krausslich et al., 1988; Mous et al., 1988; Korant and Rizzo, 1989; Loeb et al.,

shown in this report, the levels of PR accumulation using pMON5863 were poor. In order to make large quantities of PR, the synthetic HIV-l PR gene used in the construct pMON5868 was fused with an autocleavage sequence recognized by HIV-l PR (corresponding to part of the C terminus of the PR gene). The resulting plasmid pMON5882 is described in Table I. The PR made in E. coli [pMON5882] accumulated in inclusion bodies, and was active upon solubilization and refolding. However, aa sequence analysis of the protein revealed that only partial autocleavage had occurred as only 11 y0 of the protein possessed Pro at the N terminus. Since the difference in size between the uncleaved and cleaved material was very small, it was difficult to separate the two forms. In order to be able to separate the mature protein from the fusion protein, a larger fusion was added to the N terminus of the synthetic HIV-l PR gene. This fusion corresponded to the first 10 aa of bovine IGF-2 protein (Easton et al., 1991) followed by 7 aa of the PR autocleavage sequence. The reason for using the IGF-2 gene fragment was that it had been optimized for translation initiation in E. coZi (Easton et al., 1991). The autocleavage sequence used is present in the virus and contains 7 aa from the C terminus of the gag gene. The resulting plasmid, pMON5888, is described in Table I. As expected, high levels of expression were obtained. SDS-PAGE analysis with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 staining and Western blot analysis using HIV-l anti-PR antibody showed that the mature protein could be separated from the fusion protein, as illustrated in Fig. 4A and B. The aa sequence analysis of the mature protein revealed that it possessed a Pro at its N terminus, indicating that the autocleavage site was correctly recognized. Using the peptide substrate TIMMQR, the protein was shown to be active. In order to demonstrate that the PR made using pMON5888 was active on a larger protein substrate, a portion of the gag-pal gene carrying a single cleavage site was cloned into an expression plasmid (Fig. 5). This substrate could be expressed by in vitro transcription/ translation (Fig. 6), since the glO-L ribosome binding site also contains a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase. Using this Gag-PO1 fragment as a substrate, it was shown that the HIV-l PR derived from either pMON5882 or pMON5888 was active on a large substrate, producing two fragments of the predicted sizes. Cleavage of the Gag-PO1 fusion was sensitive to the aspartyl PR inhibitor pepstatin (Fig. 6, lane D), as would be expected for HIV-l PR. Hence, the HIV- 1 PR produced by these expression plasmids is consistent with the predicted activity of the native enzyme. The HIV- 1 PR derived from pMON5888 is currently being used as a reagent for the design of inhibitors.

tained with PR purified from E. coli [pMON5882]

The incubation buffer contained 20 mM phosphate pH 6.4/20x glycerol/ 0.1 Y0 CHAPS/l.5 mM DTT. In order to demonstrate that the cleavage of the substrate is PR-specific, the PR inhibitor pepstatin was added (dissolved in DMSO), to a Iinal concentration of 12 mM (lane D). A control containing DMSO without pepstatin is included (lane C). After 30 min at 30°C an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to stop the reaction. Approximately 15 pCi from each digestion was separated by 0.1 y0 SDS-15% PAGE under reducing/denaturing conditions. The gel was hxed in methanol/acetic acid/water, incubated in `Enlightening' (NEN Corp.) for 30 min and dried onto filter paper. The dried gel was exposed to x-ray film overnight at -70°C. Methods: HIV-l PR assays were done using synthetic peptide substrate, TIMMQR, as described in Krausslich et al(1989).
