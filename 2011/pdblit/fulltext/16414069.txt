Introduction
proteasome is a multicataly-tic proteinase complex that is responsible for the intracellular protein turnover in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This cellular function is linked to the protein degradation pathway that requires ubiquitin and ATP, involving the 26s proteasome in which the core and proteolytic chamber is formed by the ZOS proteasome. The proteasome removes abnormal, misfolded or improperly assembled proteins from the cell and it is involved in the stress response, cell-cycle control, cell differentiation and metabolic adaptation to the cellular immune response [l-8]. The determination of the crystal structure of the 20s proteasome from Sac&zro~~~~~ cert&% reveals that the 28 protein subunits are arranged as a (al-a7, pl--~7J2 complex consisting of four stacked rings [9]. l'hrec of the seven different p subunits are fully processed during assembly and maturation of the protein with release of the amino-terminal nucleophile, Thrl, in the active sites of the pl, 82 and /% subunits. Mutational studies in yeast have shown that these three p subunits are responsible for The

the three major proteolytic activities of the eukaryotic proteasome against small chromogenic substrates and a large protein, respectively [lo-121, that is? pl for the post-glutamyl peptide hydrolytic (PGPH). PZ for the trypsin-like and BS for the chymotrypsin-like activity. Specific modulation of these activities with reversible and irreversible inhibitors is essential for a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this enzyme in substrate degradation and thus in cytosolic protein breakdown. For this purpose, various reversible and irreversible synthetic inhibitors have been proposed (for a recent review, see [13]). Besides the known peptidyl c@`-epoxyketone [14], peptidyl chloromethyl ketone and peptidyl diazomethyl ketone irreversible inhibitors [lS], 3.4dichloroisocoumarin [16,17] was found to to react covalently with Thrl in the active site 18,191 and the microbial natural product lactacystin [ZO] was shown to react with the same site via its active r/aJto-lactacystin-P-lactone intermediate [21,22]. Although lactacystin still exhibits partial inhibition of both the PGPH and trypsin-like activities [20,23], significantly more selective inhibitors for the chymotrypsin-like activity

were obtained with peptidyl vinylsulfones [24,25]. For a reversible inhibition of mammalian proteasomes, a series of peptide aldehydes and peptide boronic acids was synthesized, with the main focus on the chymotrypsin-like activity (for a recent review? see [26]). Cross-reaction of the synthetic inhibitors with other proteases is known to occur, but, surprisingly, even the natural product lactacystin was found to inactivate cathepsin A as well as the proteasome [27]. Previous studies determined that the treatment of mammalian [Z&29] and yeast [12] proteasomes with large excesses of the thiol reagent N-ethylmaleinimide (NEM) leads to selective inhibition of the trypsin-like activity. Because of the high reactivity of NEM, at least 17 sites per enzyme particle were found to be modified, so the experiments did not identify the essential residues for the proteolytic activity. The crystal structure of yeast 20s proteasome revealed that a cysteine residue is located near to the B2 active site, Cys118 of the B3 subunit, which protrudes with its sidechain into the S3 subsite of this active site [9]. This cysteine residue is conserved among the known primary structures of the B3 subunits of eukaryotic proteasomes; the observed inactivation of the trypsin-like activity of the mammalian and yeast proteasomes might, therefore, indeed derive from the chemical modification of this thiol function if recognition and binding of the substrate is prevented by the cyclic N-ethyl-succinimidylthio moiety in the S3 subsite. In the present study, we have analyzed the possibility of exploiting the Cysl18 thiol function for the development of new inhibitors that selectively address the active site of the B2 subunit and, therefore, its trypsin-like activity. We had to use the crystal structure of yeast proteasome [9] as a basis for' the design of these inhibitors, because no structural data of the mammalian proteasomes are available so far. ,4s outlined schematically in Figure 1, the cysteine residue in the S3 subsite was used to anchor peptide aldehyde inhibitors via a thiol-reactive `handle' in close proximity to'the Thrl residue of the p2 active site for inactivation of the amino-terminal nucleophile by a covalent hemiacetal bond. With this inhibitor design, the basic principle of multivalency [30,31] was applied in a new version, in which specific recognition of peptide aldehydes adapted in their structure to the S subsites leads to a covalent grafting near the active site and therefore to an increase in the concentration around the active site to values that could make the inhibition practically irreversible.

This group was positioned asa P3 residue into the S3 subsite in interacting distance from the Cysll8 thiol function. From the kinetic point of view, upon recognition and binding of the Pl-P2 moiety by the active site, the reaction of the maleinimide group with the Cysll8 thiol should occur immediately, if a spacerof the correct size and properties is used. The ethylene moiety wasselected asthe spacer(Figure 1) becauseit was predicted that, asethylene is relatively small, it would restrict the movements of the maleinimide group but allow the rotational motion required for an optimal adaptation to the reactive thiol group. Becauseof the unique location of Cys118 in the S3 subsite of p2, such maleoyl-peptide aldehydes should act asclassicalreversible inhibitors at the 81 and B.5 active sites with affinities related mainly to the sidechain properties of residuesPl and P2. The aldehydes exert a strong inactivation of the 02 active site, however, if the,spacer of the bound dipeptide unit allows the maleinimide to react with with the thiol group or oicene7sa forif mation of the succinimidylthio group allows optimal fitting of the dipeptide unit into the Sl-S2 subsites.

For the synthesis of the peptide aldehydes 3 and 4, Z-Lys(Boc)-OH and Z-Arg(Adoc),-OH were converted to the corresponding Weinreb amides that were then reduced with LiAIH, to produce the related aldehydes, as outlined in Figure 2. These were protected as diethyl acetals for the further amino-terminal elongation steps to the dipeptides and finally to the maleoyl derivatives. Upon acid treatment of the fully protected intermediates, the maleoyl-B-alanyl-dipeptide aldehydes 3 and 4 were isolated as hydrochloride and trifluoroacetate, respectively, and as stable compounds upon storage in the cold.

attributed to partial access of the substrate to the S3blocked 02 active site. More probable, however, is the nonspecific cleavage of the trypsin-substrate at the other two active sites of the multicatalytic protease, as a residual trypsin-like activity of 1.5% was also determined for a BZ subunit Thrl-+Ala mutant of yeast proteasome [lo]. This would suggest that at high concentrations NEM is capable of inactivating the active site of the BZ subunit almost completely by modifying the adjacent CysllX residue of the B3 subunit. Although maleinimides are known for their very fast and quantitative reaction with thiols [34,35], the slow and highly concentration-dependent kinetics of inactivation can only be explained by a strongly impeded diffusion of the reagent into the inner chamber of the proteasome. Ac-Leu-Leu-Nle-H inhibits the chymotryptic activity of the yeast proteasome with high potency (IC,, = 2.1 PM) and very weakly inhibits both the PGPH and trypsin-like activities (Table 2). Correspondingly, both the potency and the time course of inactivation of the yeast proteasome by the related maleoyl compound 2 were expected to be similar to that by NEM. As shown in Figure 3b, at just 100 @I concentration of compound 2 the trypsin-like activity is, however, totally blocked after 30 min incubation. When crystals of the proteasome from Thermop~asma acidophihm [36] and S. cereuisiae [9] are soaked with 5mM calpain inhibitor I. all active sites are occupied by the tripeptide aldehyde, confirming the relatively unspecific substrate, and therefore inhibitor, recognition properties of the single active sites of the proteasomes. This unspecific recognition of the maleoyl-dipeptide aldehyde 2 by the BZ active site could explain the significantly higher inactivation potency of this compound than that of NEM. Moreover, at 100 pM concentration inhibitor 2 apparently competes very efficiently with the trypsin substrate Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-AMC (where AMC = 7-amido-4-methyl-coumarin) for binding to

To compare the inhibitory potencies of maleoyl-B-alanyldipeptide aldehydes with inactivation by the simple thiol reagent NEM, the yeast proteasome was incubated with NEM at concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 1 mM. As expected from previous findings in mammalian [Z&29] and yeast [12] proteasomes, the PGPH and chymotrypsin-like activities are not affected by NEM at concentrations up to 100 /&I (data not shown). Conversely, as shown in Figure 3a, incubation of the proteasome with 1 @I or 10 @I NEM leads to a time-dependent weak, but welldetectable reduction of the trypsin-like activity. At 100 @I and, in an even more pronounced manner, at 1 mM NEM concentration significantly faster inactivation is observed which reaches a plateau value of approximately 10% residual activity after 1 h and 40 min incubation, respectively. These results are in full agreement with earlier findings [l&28,29]. The residual activity of about 10% may be

the pl and fi.5 sites, thus leading to the quantitative suppression of substrate hydrolysis. ,4s expected from the inhibitory properties of Ac-Leu-Leu-Nle-H (Table 21, the related compound 2 does not inhibit the proteasome's PGPH activity, but surprisingly it doesn't even inhibit the chymotryptic activity when these activities are measured with the `specific' substrates Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-PNA and Sue-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC. respectively. Replacement of the Ac-Leu portion of the calpain inhibitor-I with the Mal-PAla moiety therefore strongly reduces the affinity of the inhibitor for the fi.5 chymotryptic site. The strong effect of hydrophobic P3 residues on inhibition of the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome is well established [37]. The time dependency of inactivation of the yeast proteasome by Mal-@Ala-Leu-Nle-H (Z), shown in Figure 3b, raises the question of whether or not peptidic compounds penetrate the proteasome barrel faster than even smaller, but nonpeptidic compounds like NEM because there is such a weak recognition of the Leu-Nle-H moiety by the subsites of the PZ active site to direct the reaction of the maleoyl group with CysllS of the S3 subsite.

Conversely, the incorporation of a basic residue into position Pl of the dipeptide aldehyde moiety was expected to greatly facilitate this recognition process and thus also facilitate binding to the 02 active site. Indeed the inactivation potency of Mal-PAla-Val-Lys-H (3) is significantly enhanced, with an IC,, value of 3.1 PM (Table 2), compared with compound 2 (IC,,, = 13 phi). With 10 @I inhibitors, the trypsin-like activity is switched off and the time course of inactivation (Figure 3c) again shows full

By replacing the lysine with arginine as Pl residue, an in the additional improvement inhibitory potency (IC,, = 0.5 @l) is observed and, within the limits of error of the assay system, again about 30 min are required for full inactivation of the proteasome (Figure 3d). Given that a loo-fold dilution of the inhibited enzyme was not restoring trypsin-like activity, the working assumption of a covalent linkage of the inhibitor to Cysl18 was confirmed. The presence of three active sites of limited substrate specificity and the difficult access of molecules into the inner chamber of the barrel-shaped multicacalytic protease make kinetic evaluation of the inhibition data difficult and complex [38]. Moreover, in the present case irreversible linkage of the inhibitors in the pros-position to the active site and reversible hemiacetal linkage of the aldehyde to the active-site Thrl adds further complication. The inhibitory potencies of the maleoyl-p-alanyl-dipeptide aldehydes were therefore compared with each other in

X-ray structure of the proteasome-inhibitor 4 adduct The binding mode of this new class of inhibitors was determined using X-ray structural aaalysis of the yeast proteasome-inhibitor 4 adduct at 2.5 .4 resolution. As shown in Figure 4, the electron-density map of the crystals soaked with Mal-PAla-Val-Arg-H is well-defined and clearly depicts the structure of the inhibitor bound to the PZ active site. The pl and PS active sites are not occupied by this inhibitor, in contrast to Ac-Leu-Leu-Kle-H, which, in crystals of the yeast proteasome, is bound to all three active sites. The latter finding is in full agreement with the low inhibition of the chymotrypsin-like and PGPH activities of the proteasome by Mal-PAla-C'alArg-H. The inhibitor is covalently linked at the carboxyl terminus to the Oy of Thrl via hemiacetal bond formation, whereby the resulting hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the backbone CO of Gly17. The arginine sidechain is deeply inserted into the Sl pocket forming a salt bridge between the guanidino group and the carboxylate of Glu.53. This interaction is reinforced by the Asp28 carboxylate and by an additional hydrogen bond to the carbony1 oxygen of Ala32 The sidechain of Glu53 is visibly shifted from its original position to form the salt bridge. \i'aline was selected as the P2 residue, in analogy to the substrate used to measure the inhibition of the trypsin-like activity; although already from the X-ray structure of the proteasome/,4c-Leu-Leu-We-H adduct it was known that the S2 subsite is shallow and does not have particular binding preferences 191. The sidechain of valine as the PZ residue points to the bulk water and a hydrogen-bonding network is established between the peptide backbone of the inhibitor and the substrate-binding cleft of the @? active site. In fact, the valine CO and NH are hydrogen bonded to Thr21 NH and CO. respectively. and the p-alanine CO to 4la49 NH. The S-K distance was measured after manual fitting of the inhibitor into the electrondensity map calculated from the model of the enzyme. The S-&Z distance is 2.15 A and therefore reasonably close to the distance of a single S-C bond (1.82 A), which indicates covalent thiosuccinimidyl linkage of the inhibitor to CysllX of the 83 subunit. The thiol addition to the maleinimide double bond occurs at only one of the two possible carbon atoms in the defined R-configuration, and the resulting thiosuccinimidyl ring is held into juxtaposition by hydrogen-bonding interactions between the imido group and the Se20 hydroxyl function, and between the succinimide carbonyl distal to the thioether bond and the sidechain amide of GlnZ2. Given that a well-defined electron-density map was even obtained for the ethylene spacer? its motion is apparently highly restricted indicating an optimal length and sufficient flexibility to place the maleinimide group into interacting distance with the cysteine thiol for adduct formation.

Discussion
Lactacystin, a microbial natural product, irreversibly inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of mammalian proteasomes [ZO]. The X-ray structure of the yeast proteasome-lactacystin adduct revealed the presence of this inhibitor covalently linked via an ester bond to the 0~ of Thrl in the p.5 active site, where a dense network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions hold the molecule in position to allow its high degree of selectivity [9]. The chymotrypsin-like activity is completely switched off with lactacystin, but partial inhibition of the PGPH and tryptic activities is also observed [20,23]. Very recently, attempts have been made to develop selective peptidyl vinylsulfone inhibitors [24,25]. A high degree of selectivity was obtained for the p5 active site, whereas selective inhibition of the pl and PZ active sites was less successful. Conversely, the maleoyl dipeptide aldehyde Mal-PAla-Val-Arg-H (4) exclusively inactivates the &? active site of the proteasome and therefore the associated trypsin-like activity switched off. The inactivation potencies of the maleoyl-dipeptide aldehydes were found to depend strongly upon the sidechain of the carboxy-terminal amino acid aldehyde. This finding supports the specific recognition of this portion of the molecule by the enzyme Sl subsite; conversion to the hemiaceta] is the primary event, followed by juxtaposition of the maleinimide group at the S3 subsite for reaction with the thiol function of Cysll8 and therefore for irreversible grafting of the inhibitor to this active site. This mechanism of inactivation could also explain why, in contrast to NEM, the X-ray structure revealed only one such molecule bound to the proteasome, despite the presence of multiple accessible cysteine residues and the soaking of the crystals with a loo-fold excess of the maleoyl compound 4.

of substrate degradation of these complex proteases. The only limitation for the use of this inhibitor is that it shows reactivity towards all types of thiols.

Materials

and methods

All solvents and reagents used in the synthesis were of the highest quality commercially available, and when required were further purified and dried by standard methods. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) silica gel 60 plates were from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany) and compounds were visualized with the chlorine/tolidine or permanganate reagent. Analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on Nucleosil 1 OO/C18 columns (Macherey-Nagel, D&en, Germany) using linear gradients of MeCN/2% H,PO, from 5:95 to 80:20 (A) or MeCN12% H,PO, from 30:70 to 80:20 (B) in 30 min. Preparative HPLC was carried out on Nucleosil RP 18 (Macherey Nagel, D&en, Germany) with linear gradients of MeCN/water from 5:95 to 50:50 in 90 min. Fast-atom bombardment (FAB)-MS spectra were recorded on a Finnigan MAT 900 and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)-MS on a Bruker Relflex III-TOF MS (Bruker-Franzen, Bremen, Germany). The substrates Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-PNA, Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-AMC and SucLeu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC were purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Proteasome from S. cerevisiae was prepared as described previously [91 and the synthesis of Ac-Leu-Leu-Nle-H (1) and H-LeuNle-Sc trifluoroacetate was reported elsewhere 1321.

Significance
Eukaryotic proteasomes are involved in the degradation of a multitude of proteins and peptides and therefore only a limited substrate specificity characterizes their active sites in the pl, p2 and PS subunits responsible for the post-glutamyl-peptide hydrolytic, trypsin-like and chymotrypsin-like activities, respectively. This makes substrate-based design of selective inhibitors extremely diff%ult. The unique location of a cysteine residue, Cysll8 of p3, in pros-position to the active site of the p2 subunit of yeast proteasome was used for the design of a new type of inhibitor based on the covalent linkage of peptide aldehydes to the thiol function. A fully selective inactivation of the p2 active site of the yeast proteasome was achieved by exploiting the trypsin-like preference of the Sl subsite for basic residues and the high reactivity of maleinimide towards thiols. Given that Cysl18 is highly consewed among the known primary structures of mammalian proteasomes, the new inhibitor could represent a powerful new tool for studying the mechanism

After 1 h 5 pl of a 0.2 M solution of mercaptoethanol was added followed by the fluorogenic substrates for PGPH (Z-Leu-Leu-Glu-PNA, 40 PM), trypsin-like (Bz-PheVal-Arg-AMC, 8 PM) and chymotrypsin-like (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-TyrAMC, 8 PM) assays. The substrates were previously dissolved in the same Tris-buffer with a minimum amount of DMSO, and the final volume of the samples was 500 pl. Fluorescence excitation/emission wavelengths were 360 nm1460 nm for AMC and 355 nm/410 nm for PNA. The rates of hydrolysis were monitored by the fluorescence increase and the initial linear portions of curves (100-300 s) were used to calculate the IC,, values. The experimental procedure for measuring the time-dependency bition of the trypsin-like activity was performed as described except that the incubation time of the enzyme with the inhibitors varied from 2 to 120 min. of inhiabove, was

The space group belongs to P2, with cell dimensions of a = 134.72 A, b = 300.51 A, c = 144.25 A and p = 112.91'. Data to 2.5 A were collected using synchrotron radiation with h = 1 .l A on the BWG-beamline at the DESY-Centre/Hamburg/Germany. Crystals were soaked in a cryoprotecting buffer (30% MPD, 28 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM morpholino-ethane-sulfonic acid (pH 6.9) and frozen in a stream of cold nitrogen gas at 90 K (Oxford Cryo Systems). X-ray intensities were evaluated by using the MOSFILM program package (version 5.3) and data reduction was performed with CCP4. The anisotropy of diffraction was corrected by an overall anisotropic temperature factor by comparing observed and calculated structure amplitudes using the program X-PLOR [39]. A total of 863058 reflections yielding 345223 unique reflections (96.1% completness) was collected. The corresponding R-merge was 6.4% at 2.5 A resolution (26.9% for the 2.6-2.5 8, resolution shell). Electron density was averaged 10 times over the twofold noncrystallographtc symmetry axis using the program package MAIN [40]. Conventional crystallographic rigid body, positional and temperature factor refinements were carried out with XPLOR using the yeast 20s proteasome structure [91 as starting model. Model building was carried out with the program FRODO [411. The structure was refined to a R-factor of 24.4% (free R-factor= 29.2%) with rms-deviations from target values of 0.011 A for bonds and 1.395" for angles 1421. Modelling experiments were performed using the coordinates of yeast 20s proteasome with MAIN [401.
