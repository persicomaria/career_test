Electric impulses (I-20 kV cm-`. 1-5 ps) cause transient structural changes in biological membranes aad lipid bilayers. leading to apparmIIy reversible pore formation (elrctroporation) with cross-membrane material flow and. if two membranes are in contact. to irreversible mcmbmne fusion (electrofusion). The fundamental process &erarive in elec:ro?oration and elrctrolusion is treated in terms of P periodic lipid block model. 3 block being a nearest-neighbour pair of lipid molecules in either of two states: (i) the polar head group in the bilayer plane or (ii) facing the centrr of n pore (or defect site). The number of blocks in the pore wall is the stochastic variable of the model describing pore size and stability. The Helmholtz free energy function characterizing the transition probabilities of the various pore states con?ains the surface energies of the pore wall and the planar bilayer and. if an electric field is present. also a dielectric polarization term (dominated by the polarization of the water layer adjacent to the pore wall). Assuming a Poisson process the average number of blocks in a pore wall is given by the solution of a non-linear differential equation. At subcritical electric fields the average pore size is stationary and very small. At supercritical field strengths the pore radius increases and. reaching a critical pore size. the membrane ruptures (dielectric breakdown). If, however. the electric field is switched off. before the critical pore radius is reached. the pore apparently completely reseals to the closed bilayer configuration (reversible electroporation).

1. Introduction
Biological membranes are known to become transiently more permeable by the action of short electric field pulses [1,2] when a certain threshold vaiue of the field strength is exceeded [l]. The electrically induced permeability increase leads to a transient exchange of matter across the perturbed membrane structures. When two membranes are in ciose contact with each other electric fields not only enhance material exchange but also cause membrane-membrane fusion [3-S]. A further aspect of electric field effects on membrane structures is the artificial transfer of macromolel

or particles into the interior of biological cells and organelles [6,7]. Recently, it was shown that homogeneous electric fields can be used to transfect culture cells in suspension with foreign genes [S]. The mechanism of electrically induced membrane permeability changes is not known. There are various proposals and estimates [1,6-121. It appears that high electric fields cause pores to form in the membranes [l-14]; the fundamentals of a general thermodynamic treatment of electric pore formation (electroporation) were given [S]. In any case, the primary action of electric fields is on the charges and dipoles of the membrane, favouring charge and dipole configurations associated with a larger overall dipole moment. This in turn may lead to a thinning of membrane patches

and to an increase in the defects in the membrane structure and, finally. to the formation of holes [Xl I]_ Moiecuiarly. in the framework of the inverted pore model [ll]. the pore edge is assumed to be a curved half-toroid surface [11.14-161. This edge concept [15] may have been borrowed from the Hartley model for micelles 1171. In particular. Fromhetz [18] has stressed that the Hartley model is not consistent with the experimental data. Here wc present a new model for a biiayer pore structurc: the periodic block model. According to this model. the pore wail contains blocks of two lipids \vhich are rotated 90' compared to the lipid position in normal planar hilayers. The periodic block model is shown to describe quantitatively the essential features of electric pore f<wmation in planar and vesicular lipid bilayer membranes.

2. The block model for a pore A pore in a lipid bilayer may be viewed to consist of a pot-c wnii and the pore interior. In our
hiock rncnt nwdcl of lipids the pore wail is a periodic arrange-

in normal hilayer position and of rotated lipid blocks (fig. I). A block is defined by t\vo ne~trcsr-neighhour lipids within a layer of tile hilayer. A rotated block contains two lipids tilted
h?; about 90" relative to the normal lipid position

in a layer. Gcncraiiy. the size of a block may dcpcnd on the numher. 1). of lipid molecules necessary to just cover the hydrophobic part of another lipid that is pcrpcndic;lar to the former ones (fig. 2). Thus 1' = h/l where II is the length of the ii~dropiiohic par1 ;ind I liw rtvcragc `thickness' of the lipid. For cholesterol It = 1.65 nm and I = 0.9
nm [

19).

hcnctz

p = 2.

Aiti~ougi~ the block rotation (fig. 2) brings the hydration uatcr of the polar head group into the mcmhrane interior. this energetically unfavourable ccjnfiguration becomes stable in the presence of a tr;i~i~~iicliihr;i~ic voltage. In the periodic block structure the periodic ~eriuence of a YO"-rotittcd block and a TOW of lipids in normal hilayer position is energetically favoureci compared to an aperiodic sequence. The

periodic structure ensures that the apolar parts of the lipid molecules which are in the membrane/ water interface are everywhere surrounded by the polar head groups of the neighbours. This head group cnvionnwnt reduces the extent of direct exposure of hydrophobic groups to water. AIthough the ordered structure of the water in the mcmbranc/water interface is loosened it is ccrtainiy not completely interrupted. If two neighbours in the inner surface of the wall (edge) arc two adjacent blocks of rotated lipids or two lipids in normal bilnyer position, in both cases ttpolnr groups are exposed to solvent to a larger extent. For the sake of a rough comparison the periodic block structure of the wall may be associated with the surface tension (y,,,) of the cholesterol bilayer/water ( y,,, = 2 X lo--' N/m [11.19]). The surface tension characteristic for the aperiodic block structure may be cirser to the value y,,,,, 0.05 N/m of the oil/wat._: interface [19]. Since block structure appears to Ylll -zz Y,*/,* the periodic be favoured.

the electroporation process occurs in a closed two-phase system: the planar lipid bilayer and the torus on the one hand and the aqueous electrolyte solution bathing the lipid phase in between a planar plate condenser on the other. Since during electroporation volume changes may occur (electrostriction) the appropriate thermodynamic work function is the Helmholtz free energy F. In a homogeneous electric field the change in the Helmholtz function is given by 121.221:

At R' = 0. d F/RT = C,, = 3.5. In previous models for small pores this ratio (60-W [lb]) is appreciably larger. Thus. in our moJc4 there is ;I finite chance for small pores: in accordance with experimenta experiences the number of pores at I'= 0 is very small.

in fig. 7, There are two lines in this diagram (attraction lines) on which the average pore size is stationary and stable at a given transmembrane voltage. The phase diagram contains two domains which are associated with critical voltages V,") and Vc(`), respectively; I$`) > VCCrl. They are called reversible electroporation domains (1 and 2). Within these domains the right-hand side of eq. 45 is negative, i.e., resealing to a smaller stationary pore size occurs, Outside these reversible electroporation domains the right-hand side of eq. 45 is positive, i.e., the pore size increases at a given voltage. For I/= 0 and N* = 6 our model yields the stable stationary solution, (N), = 1.5 X 10m3, i.e., the average value of N in the absence of a transmembrane voItage is very small. At V< V:t) the

pore size (N) increases but remains small: switching off the voltage in this range leads to a (reversible) return of the system to (N)a (see, for instance, the pathway a --, b --+ 6' --, a; fig. 7). The two reversible electroporation domains are separated from each other by a rupture domain.

In summary, our periodic block model for pores in lipid bilayers appears to be consistent with basic features of observed electroporation phenomena. The fundamental process of pore formation is the block rotation by about 90° comprising (two) nearest-neighbour lipids. The driving force for block rotation in electric fields is the electric polarization of the polar solvent molecules (adjacent to the polar head groups of the lipids) which are transported by lipid rotation into the region of the larger electric field spreading irom the pore wall into the solution of the pore interior.

In fig. 9 the dashed curve represents eq. 46 in terms of the relative resealing time given by [( - X)/T] exp( - a/kT). The solid curve is calculated from eq. 46 in terms of (N)' - (NX,)' where (Iv,,) is the average threshold pore size [20]. For (N) c ( N1,,) no ions are conducted anymore. The shape of this (solid) curve is the same as that of the experimental conductivity vs. time curves [20]. Therefore, as is physically plausible, the ion conductance is proportional to N" (i.e., the surface of the pore mouth)_ When we now use the same scaling factor T-`exp( - rr/kQ = lo4 s-' as for the pore formation, the time constant associated with the linear section of the function ln(( N)' - ( Nrh)`) is found to be 0.55 ps. This value is exactly the relaxation time of the faster part of the experimental resealing process at 40°C [203.
