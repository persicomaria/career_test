Introduction
The worldwide resurgence of infectious diseases, largely due to the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, is a serious medical problem [l-3]. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have become recognized as important opportunistic human pathogens over the past decade. Increased reliance on the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin to treat enterococcal infections and those caused by the dreaded methicillin-resistant Stap/zylococcus aurezlS (MRSA) [4] has not only caused a rise in clinically significant resistance and mortality from VRE, but also represents a looming infectious catastrophe for MRSA [d-8]. In the most prevalent clinical phenotypes of vancomycin resistance, VanA and VanB [8], bacteria have developed a strategy for reprogramming cell wall biosynthesis to new peptidoglycan precursor termini, which exhibit dramatically lower affinity for vancomycin. This paradigm of bacterial adaptation requires expression of the genes aanR, vans, aanH, canA and aatzX (using VanA phenotypic nomenclature, Figure 1) [9] to produce peptidoglycan chain precursors terminating in D-alanyl-D-lactate

(D-Ala-D-lactate) in place of D-alanyl-D-alanine (DAla-D-Ala), resulting in a lOOO-fold decrease in vancomycin binding affinity and in unimpeded peptide strand cross-linking. The outcome is a mechanically strong cell wall whose synthesis is not inhibited by glycopeptides [lo]. Vans and VanR act as a two-component regulatory system to mediate antibiotic-induced transcription of the genes vanH, nad and uanX, whose products act sequentially (VanH, VanA) to synthesize the depsipeptide D-Ala-D-lactate in place of the normal DAla-D-Ala dipeptide [ll,lZ]. VanX is a zinc-containing D,D-dipeptidase that hydrolyzes D-rZla-D-Ala but not DAla-D-lactate, allowing the D,D-depsipeptide to accumulate and become incorporated in the growing peptidoglycan termini [13,14]. In the Van,4 VRE phenotype, these genes are clustered on a transposon with two genes associated for transposition functions (o$ and o$`) and two other oan genes, nanY and aanZ [9] (Figure 1). Although the VanE; D,D-carboxypeptidase is not essential for a high level of resistance in the VanA VRE phenotype, it is believed to contribute moderately

to the resistance (e.g. in the VanB phenotype) by removing the terminal D-Ala from the newly synthesized UDP-muramyl-L-Ala-D-Glu-L-Lys-L>-Ala-II-Ala that has escaped the VanX route [ 151, snnZ has no identified function and it is not essential for resistance. The origin of the glycopeptide resistance genes in enterococci has been an issue since their discovery: a first glimpse at a possible source came with the recent detection of a WZ~HAX gene cluster similar to that found in VRE in the glycopeptide antibiotic-producing Strepto7ByceJ toyocaensis and Amycolatopsis orientalis [ 161. The demonstration that the VanX homolog (StoVanX) encoded by the S. toyocaensis s?anHAX gene cluster possesses both the anticipated D-Ala-D-i\ia dipeptidase activity and lacks &Ala-r>-lactate depsipeptidase activity [ 171 suggests a conserved mechanism for the observed intrinsic resistance of the antibiotic producers to the vancomycin class of glycopeptides. As s. toyocaensis also possesses a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase [18], the uanHAX genes may be switched on transcriptionally as the host commences antibiotic biosynthesis, allowing cell-wall termini to be reprogrammed to effect immunity to vancomycin in a timely fashion. Such a regulatory circuit (yet to be verified experimentally) is consistent with the view that antibiotic-resistance genes might have coevolved with the antibiotic-biosynthesis genes. VanX homologs have also been detected in the gram-negative bacterium Eschetichia coli (EcoVanX) and Sy'nrchorystis sp. (SynVanX), which have no need for defense against glycopeptide antibiotics (the outer membranes of E. co/i and Syne&~~~tic sp. are impermeable to vancomycin) [17]. In E. cob, the ecooanX gene is found clustered with a putative dipeptide permease system that permits import of D-Ala-D-i\la into the cell [17]. The consecutive action of ecoaanx, pyruvate oxidase and the membraneous I)amino acid dehydrogenase would permit an energy generating role for this enzyme couple upon induction of the ecoaanX and downstream permease genes by the stationary phase transcription factor CY under starvation conditions. A possible source of periplasmic D-Ala-D-Ala could

be r,,D-meso-diaminopimelic tidation, which increases

acid (AZpm)-A2pm transpepduring stationary phase [17].

VanX and II-Ala-o-Ala ligase (Ddl) catalyze antagonistic reactions - Ddl operates in the dipeptide biosynthetic direction. whereas VanX operates in the hydrolytic direction (Figure 2a). Because enzymes catalyze reactions in both directions (although the equilibria might be heavily biased in one direction. in this instance Ddl is driven in the contrathermodynamic direction by coupling ,4TP hydrolysis to amide-bond formation), the two opposing enzymes have many of the same requirements. In this case, they must recognize the ground state for D-Ala-n-Ala as substrate (VanX) or product (Ddl), and differentially recognize the two 1,-,41a monomers as electrophile and nucleophile (Ddl) or as first leaving group (VanX). Ddl and VanX must form and stabilize tetrahedral adducts at the amide link of D-Ala-D-Ala to lower activation barriers and speed up catalysis. To perform their related tasks, one enzyme uses ,4TP cleavage to drive amide-bond synthesis (Ddl), tvhereas the other employs zinc to activate bound water for hydrolysis of I>-Ala-D-Ala (VanX). Despite the difference in cofactor usage, one might expect the catalytic inventory for the l&Ala-D-Ala ligase and the n-Ala--D-Ala dipeptidase active sites to be analogous and fulfill equivalent functions. To recognize D-Ala-D-Ala (as substrate or nascent product) one would expect an active-site residue in each enzyme to hydrogen bond and/or charge pair with the a-NH,+ of D-Ala-n-Ala (most likely Enz-COO-) and a corresponding recognition of the substrate-COOto occur as well (EnzOH utilized). To stabilize the incipient charge that develops in the transition state as the planar sp2 carbonyl moiety is transformed to the sp" tetrahedral anion (and vice versa; Figure 2a) one would expect an enzyme active-site cation properly placed to stabilize the developing negative charge (e.g. a multidentate arginine-sidechain: Figure Zb).

Reactions catalyzed by the Ddl and VanX enzymes. (a) DdlB and VanX catalyze antagonistic reactions. The Ddl ligase runs in the amide synthetic direction and has to consume a molecule of ATP to allow the reaction to proceed. In contrast, VanX runs in the hydrolytic direction and uses a zinc atom and a water molecule to accomplish its task.

Both enzymes must form and stabilize similar tetrahedral adducts at the amide link of the D-Ala-o-Ala molecule, however. (b) Despite their difference in cofactor usage, similar sidechains between the two enzymes are predicted for ground state and specific binding, and transition-state stabilization.

for VanX, has given us a view of the active-site geometry and the disposition of active-site sidechains. The VanX structure, in particular. predicts specific enzyme sidechains that could fulfill the requirements shown in Figure 2 for both ground-state recognition and specific binding, as well as for transition-state stabilization. To test these predictions we have generated mutants of VanX at seven different positions and evaluated the catalytic efficiency of the mutant enzymes. We compare equivalent sidechain functions in Ddl. Sequence analysis of VanY and VanX, in addition to comparison with the X-ray structure of the zinc-dependent u-Ala-+-Ala carboxypeptidase (a VanY homolog) from Strepfomq'ces ahs G (Ddp) [Zl]. has allowed us to predict an equivalent organization of the active sites of these enzymes for recognition and hydrolysis of either the ,V-acyl-D-Ala-[,-Ala (\?anY and Ddp) or I>-Ala-n-Ala (VanX).

appears to play this role in the case of bound phosphinate. Both Serl14 and Serll5 were changed singly to alanine. Arg71 is a candidate to stabilize the anionic tetrahedral adduct and its associated transition states so it was mutated to an alanine, histidine or lysine residue. Tyr35 and Asp68 are in position to form a hydrogen-bond triad with Arg71 and could serve to orient ,4rg71. Tyr35 was mutated to phenylalanine and Asp68 to alanine or asparagine. We showed previously that VanX retains full activity as a I,,t)-dipeptidase when fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) [23], so the kinetic data reported in Table 1 were obtained using the intact MBP-VanX mutant fusion proteins in each case. Characterization of MBP-VanX mutants as D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptidases Table 1 lists the steady-state kinetic data of various MBP-VanX mutants. For a zinc-dependent peptide-bond hydrolase such as VanX, catalytic efficiency will be determined by optimizing the orientation of the substrate t>-Ala-n-Ala and water as ligands at or around the catalytic zinc and lowering barriers for reaction. Coordination of the substrate I)-Ala-[)-Ala and the tetrahedral adducc to zinc are anticipated and supported by the X-ray data [19]. Three categories of effects were observed for the VanX mutants: modest change: TyQl+Phe, Tyr3S-+Phe and Serl lS-+Ala; intermediate change: Serl l++Ala: and large change: the AspllZ, Arg71 and ,4sp68 mutants. Modest effects: TyRl+Phe, Tyr35+Phe and Serl15+Ala The mutant TyrZl-+Phe is only decreased 125fold in catalytic efficiency (k,,,/K,,). which mainly results from a 38-fold increase in K,,. The loss of the phenolic hydroxiyl.

Results
Design and production of VanX mutants The recently reported X-ray structure of enterococcal VanX [19] bound to its substrate I,-Ala-[)-Ala and phosphinate, a reaction intermediate analog [ZZ], guided the initial mutant construction design to test for residue function. At the amino terminus of bound r)-Ala-n-Ala or phosphinate, three VanX residues (Tyr21, Asp142 and Asp123) were found in close proximity for hydrogen bonding with the substrate/analog cx-IKHj+ (Figures 3 and 4). Asp123 WiS shown previously to be a critical ligand for zinc binding [23]. Tyr21 was mutated to phenylalanine and Asp142 to an alanine or asparagine residue. Serll.~ has been proposed to form a hydrogen bond at the carboxyl end of bound D-Ala-u-Ala, whereas it is the sidechain of Serl14 that

Figure 3 (a) (W
Crystal structure comparison of the active-site residues of (a) VanX and (b) Ddlf3 with bound phosphinate [191 and phosphorylphosphinate [201, respectively. Glul5, Ser281 and Arg255 in DdlB are similarly placed with respect to the transition-state analog and are functionally equivalent to Asp1 42, Serl14 and Arg71 in VanX. Serl50 orients Glul5 in DdlB as TyrPl orients Asp1 42 in VanX. TyrPl is also hydrogen bonded to the substrate cx-NH,+. The arginine residues stabilize the transitionstate intermediate with help from Lys215 in DdlB and the zinc atom in VanX. Arg71 in VanX is oriented by Asp68 and Tyr35. DdlB uses Lys2 15 for phosphate transfer, whereas VanX uses the similarly placed Glu181 to abstract a proton from a water molecule for subsequent attack on the carbonyl group of the substrate. The zinc ligands are His1 16, Asp1 23 and His1 84.

abrogating a medium-length hydrogen bond (3.2 A) to the cc-IKH,+ group of the dipeptide has only a modest effect, suggesting that this is not a crucial interaction by itself. The second tyrosine residue, Tyr35, is part of a triad with the Arg71 and Asp68 residues that probably form hydrogen bonds with each other to orient the guanidinium sidechain of Arg71 to stabilize the incipient negative charge of the tetrahedral transition state after the attack of the zinc-coordinated water molecule (Figure 4). Disruption of Tyr35 hydrogen-bonding potential (Tyr35-+Phe) is noticeable but slight (there is a Zl-fold increase in K,,). Figure 4

The Asp68 sidechain is probably the primary determinant controlling the orientation of Arg71 (see below). The Serl lS--+Ala mutation has a very small effect. The Khl increases by a factor of two but because the k,,, increases threefold, the mutant is actually a better catalyst than wildtype VanX. This result turns out not to be so surprising because this residue is not conserved in other VanX homologs (except for the VanX from the type B resistance) [17]. Serl15 is, therefore. not a crucial substrate-binding element and the Serllj-+Ala mutant serves as a good control for interpreting the Serl14+Ala mutant. intermediate effect: Serl14+Ala The Serll4-+Ala mutant is a 2500-fold less efficient enzyme with only a L.&fold decrease in k,,, but a 2000-fold increase in k;,. The loss of enzyme efficiency is entirely due to loss of substrate binding, as would be expected for a ground-state effect in substrate COO- recognition. The element for binding of the carboxylate end of the substrate is therefore Serll4 as obsen,ed in the VanX structure with bound phosphinate and not SerllS as was observed with bound II-Ala-n-Ala [ 191. Large effects: Arg71, Asp142 and Asp66 mutants .4rg71-+Ala and Arg71-+His mutants show no detectable dipeptidase activity over a time course of 12 h, suggesting that Arg71 is crucial. The Arg71+Lys mutant has detectable activity but shows a 1.7 x 10h-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency, due to a 2750-fold increase in K,, and a 670-fold reduction in kcaf. These results suggest substantial loss of transition-state recognition/stabilization. `I'he Arg71 mutants are most seriously affected, consistent with a key role in catalytic function. Neither the Arg7l+Lys nor the Arg'll+His basic sidechains seem to be able to achieve an orientation that can substitute for the placement of Arg71.

method (see the Materials and methods section). were determined from the corrected absorbance [40]. nd, no detectable activity over 12 h.

The ,4rg142+Ala and Arg142-+,4sn mutants were constructed because the X-ray structure of VanX shows that Asp142 is within 2.8 w of the D,D-substrate's a-NH,+, consistent with participation in ground-state recognition (Figure 4). The Aspl4Z+Asn mutant is decreased only 87-fold in k,,, but is increased 1200-fold in Khl, suggesting that Asn142 might still be able to hydrogen bond with the D,D-substrate a-NH,+. The k,,, of the Asp142+Ala mutant is decreased 700-fold, an order of magnitude worse than the Asp142-+;2sn mutant. It is not clear why the K1, is only increased 81-fold, however. These effects in k,,, and KR, have not been subdivided into effects on microscopic rate constants, so we make no further interpretation about effects on elementary steps. When the importance of Asp68 was examined, with the Asp68+Asn and Asp68--+Ala mutants, substitution of aspartate by asparagine preserves more function than the aspartate to alanine switch. Here, both mutants have a ZOO-300-fold decrease in k,,, but the Asp68jAsn mutant only has a 63-fold increase in K,,, whereas in the Asp68+Ala mutant, the K,,, was 750-fold worse. The VanX crystal structure shows that Asp68 is the central residue in the Arg71-Asp68-Tyr35 hydrogen-bonding triad. Presumably the asparagine sidechain in the Asp68+Asn mutant retains more contact with Arg71 than does the alanine sidechain in the ,4sp68+Ala mutant, assisting in productive orientation of Arg71 for transition-state stabilization.
Detection of novel activity in mutant proteins

TyrZl+Phe, had an increased ability to hydrolyze I>-lactyl-D-Ala. The AsplilZ+Asn and Asp142+Ala mutants showed a 60- and 160-fold increase in peptidase activity, respectively, compared with the wild-type enzyme, which has a barely detectable k,,JK1, of 2 x lo-' m,\l-`s-l, a factor of 10' worse than for I,-Ala-r>Ala (Table 2). The Tyr2l-+Phe VanX mutant shows a much larger effect with an increase of 4300-fold in catalytic efficiency over the wild-type enzyme. For this mutant, II-Ala-u-Ala is only 30-fold better by k,,,/K:,, criterion than D-lactyl-D-Ala. This 30-fold difference is almost entirely due to K,,. The k,,, of TyrZl+Phe for o-lactylo-Ala cleavage is only sixfold lower than the wild-type enzyme for its natural substrate, D-Ala-D-Ala, suggesting a similar substrate orientation for peptide cleavage in each enzyme. In wild-type VanX Ty21, which hydrogen bonds to Aspl42, might exclude D-lact+II-.t\la by means of electrostatic repulsion between two oxygens. The Asp142 mutants have only a twofold increase in catalytic efficiency for n-Ala--u-Ala than I>-lactyl-D-Ala. Again removal of electron density close to the binding site for D-Alan-Ala a-NH,+ allows better binding of the uncharged D-lactyl-D-Ala substrate. Interestingly, in DdlB? a D-lactyi-D-141a ligase activity was detected in the GlulS+Gln mutant [24]. Both Glu15 in DdlB and Asp142 in VanX are involved in the a-&H,+ recognition of the substrate n-Ala for DdlB and D-Ala-D-Ala for VanX.

Discussion
We examined the mutant proteins for `gain of function' novel activities by testing other potential enzyme substrates. In no case was ;V-acetyl-rj-Ala-D-Ala a substrate, even for the TyrZl-+Phe mutant, but the reverse regioisomer of D-Ala-D-lactate, the n-lactyl-D-Ala amide (which lacks an a-NH,+ group) showed an interesting substrate profile. Three mutants, Asp142-+Ala, Aspl4Z-+Asn and Metalloproteases have been a successfully targeted for rationally designed therapeutic agents in other biological contexts (e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors), suggesting that VanX is a prime candidate for design of inhibitors to combat VRE. In an earlier study of the zincdependent metallodipeptidase enterococcal VanX (VanAtype resistance). we identified, using mutagenesis, residues His1 16, Asp123 and His184 as probable zinc-coordination

ligands and Glu181 as the probable general base for deprotonation of the zinc-coordinated water molecule that subsequently attacks the I>-Ala-II-Ala substrate [23]. The recent crystallographic structure determination of enterococcal VanX has confirmed these assignments [ 191. Similar recognition features for D-Ala-D-Ala ligase and D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptidase A comparison of the active-site organization for substrate and transition-state recognition by the ligase Ddl and the hydrolase VanX has been enabled by X-ray structures with tightly binding inhibitors, phosphinate for VanX and phosphorylated phosphinate for Ddl. that built on our earlier mechanistic studies of each enzyme [Z&25]. The bound phosphinate ligands in each enzyme are taken to be stable analogs of the two tetrahedral intermediates (Figure Za) and so have suggested orientations of the corresponding reaction intermediate in the active site of each enzyme. Figure 3 shows a remarkable correspondence of orientation of the same three types of sidechains for the same three functions in the ligase and dipeptidase active site: Glu15 (Ddl) versus Asp142 (VanX) for hydrogen bonding/charge pairing to the positively charged amino group of tetrahedral adduct phosphinate analogs; Ser281 (Ddl) versus Serl1-l (VanX) for equivalent hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl end of the r),r,-analog; and ArgZSS (Ddl) versus Arg71 (VanX) for binding to the tetrahedral phosphinate oxygen (analagous to the tetrahedral adduct of the substrate) for transition-state/tetrahedral-adduct stabilization. In Ddl, Glu1.5 is oriented by SerlSO and Tyr216 in a hydrogen-bond network. In VanX Asp142 is similarly oriented by Tyr21. hlutation of either SerlSO or Tyr216 in Ddl [Zj] or Tyr21 in VanX, has only modest effects on catalytic efficiency. In contrast, mutation of Glu15 in Ddl [25] or Asp142 in VanX has a pronounced effect on catalytic activity. Mutations at Ser281 in Ddl [25] or Serll4 in VanX also have a substantial effect on substrate recognition as predicted. The Arg255+Ala Ddl mutant experienced at least a 2000-fold decrease in k,,,, at the noise level of the assay [25], which parallels the crucial role of Arg71 demonstrated here for VanX catalysis. It appears that a parallel strategy evolved wise quite different enzymes to provide, in these otherfirst, a specific

binding pocket that recognizes only the unmodified D,D-dipeptide and, second, to stabilize developing anionic charge arising from rehybridization of the substrate amide carbonyl in the tetrahedral adduct. The other elements of the catalytic apparatus of each enzyme have evolved differently. The l&se runs in the amide synthesis direction and requires hydrolysis of one molecule of ATP to drive that equilibrium, mechanistically activating the y-phosphoryl for attack by the first D-Ala (Figure 2a). The Lys215 of Ddl is required to act as a charge shield for the negative charge on the p of ATP to lower electrostatic repulsions in the catalytic instant of phosphor);1 transfer. No such function exists in VanX and there is no equivalent residue. There is, instead, a zinc atom in the VanX active site poised to interact with the bound substrate's dipeptide carbonyl group and to coordinate a water molecule that will attack the amide bond. VanX needs a general base to activate the zinc-water complex, a function that is provided by Glu181 (Figure 3). There is no comparable requirement in Ddl and therefore no comparable general base. The polarity of Lys215 in Ddl (cationic) and Glu181 in VanX (anionic) is therefore reserved for the two specific and differentiated jobs that these opposing enzymes have to perform. VanY and Ddp: two N-acyl-D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidases with similar active-site residues equivalent to VanX The identification of residues for zinc coordination in the VanX enzyme has revealed a new family of zinc proteases that uses the novel consensus sequence SxHxxGxAxD, where aspartate and histidine residues are zinc ligands (the third and fourth ligands to zinc are a histidine several residues downstream in the primary sequence and water) [23]. The VanY and Ddp enzymes both have this consensus `zinc motif [23] (although the VanY has yet to be validated for zinc content, its activity was shown to be dependent on divalent ions [26]) and act analogously on D-.Ala--I>-!Lla peptides as carboxypeptidases. VanY and Ddp differ from VanX in that they act on ;V-acylated-D,t>-peptide, and VanY shows activity towards the depsipeptide N-acyl-n-Ala-r>lactate [27]. Structural comparison of VanX and Ddp revealed a strong homology in and around the active site [lY]. The zinc ligands, the serine residue for recognition of the terminal carboxylate moiety of D-.Ala-D-L41a and the arginine residue for stabilization of the transition state are structurally conserved in Ddp and VanX (Figure 5,). In Ddp a histidine residue apparently replaces Glu181 of VanX as catalytic base for water activation. The overall root mean square deviation value for superimposition of the sidechains of the zinc ligands, glutamate/histidine, serine and arginine residues is 1.03 A. The key .4sp68-Arg71 hydrogen bond interaction of VanX is mimicked by an Arg138-A4sn143 interaction in Ddp. Primary sequence analysis suggests that the two enterococcal proteins VanY and VanX are more closely related than Ddp is to either VanX or VanY. We predicted previously

Structural comparison of the active-site arrangements of VanX with bound phosphinate with Ddp. (a) Stereo diagram of the structural alignments of active-site residues of VanX (red) and Ddp (yellow). The zinc atoms are shown in red (VanX) and yellow (Ddp) and the phosphinate bound to VanX is orange. The alignment was performed on the sidechains shown, except for Asp68 (VanX) and Asn143 (Ddp), using the program Cluanta@ (Molecular Simulations Inc.). (b) VanX and (c) Ddp surface electrostatic potential representation. Both proteins are positioned so that the conserved active-site residues highlighted in (a) are similarly oriented. The Ddp active site forms a channel on the surface. The VanX active site is in a pocket. The view of VanX has been cut away to reveal the active site and the bound phosphinate. The position of the active-site residue arginine (transition-state stabilization), aspartate (zinc ligand), serine (carboxylate recognition) and glutamatelhistidine (catalytic base) are indicated by arrow boxes using single-letter amino-acid code. The position of the other two zinc ligands (histidine residues) is approximated by the blue color surrounding the zinc atom (white), which is partially buried in both structures. The calculations were performed using GRASP (431 with a water probe radius of 1.4 A and electrostatic potential ranging from blue (+50 kt/e) to red (-50 kt/e).

the catalytic glutamate residue (Glu'2.38) and zinc ligands (His188, Asp195 and His241) for the enterococcal VanY [23] (Figure 6). A BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) detected seven additional bacterial homologs to VanY, including VanY from the VanB VRE phenotype (but did not rank Ddp as a homolog), and has allowed us to identify potential active-site residues. In all cases the Arg-(Asn/Gln) pair is conserved, which is indicative of a similar role for the arginine of VanY in transition-state stabilization. Another similarity is the conservation of the equivalent of the VanX active site Trp197 [19] in all VanY and VanX homologs in an E(P/W)WH motif. This tryptophan residue is found in proximity to and is believed to interact with the transitionstate adduct [19]. The serine residue just upstream of the first histidine ligand to zinc (SxHxxGxAxD), Ser186 in VanY, is strictly conserved in the VanY family and predicted to be structurally equivalent to Serl14 in VanX or Ser152 in Ddp. This serine is functionally responsible for recognition of the terminal carboxylate moiety of the muramyl-L-iilaD-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala substrate (Figure 6). The question arises, given the highly conserved architecture of active-site residues in VanX and VanY zinc carboxypeptidases (Figure 6) as to how the differential recognition of a free amino group (as in VanX) versus an lv-acyl amino group (as in VanY) is achieved when scanning potential D-AlaD-Ala substrates. The Tydl and Asp142 residues that recognize the a-NH,+ group in free D-Ala-D-Ala are not

preserved in the VanY sequences. Their absence in the Ddp structure provides a channel for accommodation of an .v-acyl chain that would be blocked off in VanX (Figure jb,c). Aside from the residues highlighted in Figure 6, VanY and VanX show very little sequence homology, perhaps suggesting convergent evolution to a common catalytic geometry for binding and hydrolysis of the D,D-dipeptide moiety. Our analysis predicts that phosphinates will be potent inhibitors of VanY and might act synergistically with VanX inhibitors, but does not yet indicate why VanY (but not VanX) has detectable Il,D-depsipeptide hydrolase activity. The homology between the VanY homologs outside the sequences highlighted in Figure 6 is very low.
Reaction mechanism of D,D-peptidase

The reaction mechanism of zinc proteases has been thoroughly investigated for thermolysin [28-301 and carboxypeptidase A enzymes [31,32] as representative zinc proteases (see [33] for review). Two variations for zinc-centered mechanisms have been proposed: the zinc hydroxide and the reverse protonation mechanisms (see [33] for review). In the zinc-hydroxide mechanism, the zinc ion functions in two ways; it polarizes the substrate carbonyl group and facilitates deprotonation of the bound water nucleophile [33]. A proximal sidechain carboxylate group shuttles a proton from the zinc-bound water nucleophile to

The asterisk indicates potential functional residues required to recognize the extended substrate in the VanY family (serine, tryptophan and tyrosine residues).

The VanX sequence alignment has been published previously [17].

the leaving group. In contrast, the reverse protonation mechanismsuggeststhat the zinc-bound water ligand will have to be protonated in order to be replaced by the carbony1 group of the substrate [30]. In this case, the conserved carboxylate-containing residue would play only a charge-neutralization role [32]. In thermolysin, a hiscidine residue would act as general base to activate the water nucleophile, whereasin carboxypeptidase A, this role would be played by the carboxylate group of the substrate[30,32]. The active-site architecture of a VanX-D-Ala-D-Ala enzyme complex is closer to that of carboxypeptidase A than thermolysin, by having a free carboxylate group of the substratein proximity to the cleavagesite and alsothe tetrahedral intermediate-stabilizing arginine residue (Arg71). In thermolysin, the arginine residue is replaced by tyrosine and histidine residuesand there is no substratecarboxylate group near the cleavage site. In the cocrystal structures of

VanX and ghosphinate or n-Ala-D-Ala, there is no residue within 8.0 A of the phosphinyl or carbonyl group that could deprotonate the water nucleophile other than Glu181 (3.3 A; absolutely required for catalysis [23]) and the carboxylate group of the substrate (3.3 A), favoring the zinchydroxide mechanism(Figure 7). Furthermore this residue is totally conserved in all VanX homologsidentified to date [17]. In the present work we showthat the Serl14 sidechain plays an important role in substrate recognition given the ZOOO-fold increasein K,, in the Serl14-+Ala mutant. For a reverse-protonation mechanism involving the carboxylate group of the D-Ala-D-Ala substrate as the catalytic base such ashas been proposed for the carboxypeptidase A [32], one would expect both kinetic parameters(not just on K,,) to be affected in the Serl14-+Ala mutant. The overall conservation of critical residues for recognition and catalytic activity between VanX, \`anY and Ddp suggest a similar reaction mechanismfor these enzymes aswell.

Significance
The metallodipeptidase VanX plays an essential role in pathogenic vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) by selectively depleting the cellular pool of D-Ala-D-Ala over D-Ala-D-lactate during reprogramming of cell wall biosynthesis to new peptidoglycan precursors terminating in D-Ala-D-lactate. There has been substantial interest in deciphering the mechanism, substrate specificity and three-dimensional structure of VanX, given that metalloproteases operating in other biological contexts, such as angiotensin converting enzyme have been successfully targeted for therapeutic intervention. We report here results from mutagenesis studies that support structurebased functional predictions and explain why the VanX dipeptidase and Ddl ligase enzymes show dramatic specificity for the small D,D-dipeptide substrate. The compact active sites and strict discrimination for small substrate ligands put constraints on inhibitor development for both VanX and the D-,D-ligase Ddl and the VRE D-,D-ligase counterpart VanA. This work shows similar architectural solutions to substrate recognition and acceleration of catalysis by two enzymes that use the same substrate but run in different directions driven by distinct cofactors (zinc versus ATP). We also identify conserved active-site residues in the VRE D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase VanY that predict a similar reaction mechanism and catalytic architecture to the VanX enzyme.

methods

Recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described elsewhere [341. Preparation of plasmid DNA, gel purification of DNA fragments, and purification of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified DNA fragments [35,361 were performed using the CIAprepe spin plasmid miniprep kit, QIAEXs II gel extraction kit and QIAquick"" PCR purification kit, respectively (QIAGEN). PCRs were carried out as described by Lessard and Perham [371, using the pfu DNA polymerase. Splicing by overlap extension (SOE) reactions [38] were carried out as for the PCR using approximately an equimolar ratio (total amount -50 ng) of each of the gel-purified PCR-amplified DNA fragments to be joined as template. The fidelity of the SOEor PCR-amplified DNA fragments was established by nucleotide sequencing after subcloning into the expression vector. Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, and DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded DNA by the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA).
