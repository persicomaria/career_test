Abstract: The first crystal structures of lipases that have been covalently modified through site-selective inhibition by different organometallic phosphonatepincer≠metal complexes are described. Two ECE-pincer-type d8-metal complexes, that is, platinum (1) or palladium (2) with phosphonate esters (ECE = [(EtO)-(O=)PACHTUNGRE(-O-C6H4-ACHTUNGRE(NO2)4)ACHTUNGRE(-C3H6-4-ACHTUNGRE(C6H2-ACHTUNGRE(CH2E)2)]¿ ; E= NMe2 or SMe) were introduced prior to crystallization and have been shown to bind selectively to the Ser120 residue in the active site of the lipase cutinase to give cut-1 (platinum) or cut-2 (palladium) hybrids. For all five presented crystal structures, the ECE-pincer≠platinum or ≠palladium head group sticks out of the cutinase molecule and is exposed to the solvent. Depending on the nature of the ECE-pincer≠metal head group, the ECE-pincer≠platinum and ≠ palladium guests occupy different pockets in the active site of cutinase, with concomitant different stereochemistries on the phosphorous atom for the cut-1 (SP) and cut-2 (RP) structures. When cut-1 was crystallized under Keywords: heavy-metal-atom labels ∑ lipases ∑ metalloenzymes ∑ pincer≠metal complexes ∑ X-ray diffraction halide-poor conditions, a novel metalinduced dimeric structure was formed between two cutinase-bound pincer≠ platinum head groups, which are interconnected through a single m-Cl bridge. This halide-bridged metal dimer shows that coordination chemistry is possible with protein-modified pincer≠metal complexes. Furthermore, we could use NCN-pincer≠platinum complex 1 as site-selective tool for the phasing of raw protein diffraction data, which shows the potential use of pincer≠platinum complex 1 as a heavy-atom derivative in protein crystallography.

Introduction
The modification of proteins with synthetic molecules has become an important strategy in the newly emerging area of chemical biology. Since the pioneering work of Kaiser[1] and Whitesides,[2] many different protein modification strategies have been developed to facilitate protein identification, to change their structural characteristics, and to study their biological functionalities and activities. The synthetic modification of biological compounds with transition-metal complexes plays a special role in this case. Through the presence of a transition metal, several novel spectroscopic and reactivity properties can be added to those a protein already intrinsically has. Transition-metal complexes attached to biomolecules have, for example, been used as anticancer agents,[3, 4] radioactive[4≠9] or luminescent[10≠12] labels, paramagnetic NMR probes,[13] or semisynthetic metalloenzymes in catalysis.[14≠28] The incorporation of transition-metal complexes into proteins can be accomplished by a variety of different methods,

Moreover, these results show complexes to the lipase cutinase in a covalent manner by that the different pincer≠metal inhibitor molecules occupy active-site-directed inhibition.[37] Cutinase (21 kDa) is a different binding pockets in the active site of the enzyme member of the lipase family (a subfamily of the serine hy(pockets 1 and 2, respectively). drolases) with an exposed catalytic triad (Ser120-Asp175His188).[39, 40] As the structure and activity of this stable enzyme have been well studied, we envisioned cutinase as being the ideal candidate for the study of semisynthetic Results pincer≠metal≠enzyme hybrids. From different studies it is known that lipases can be inhibited by phosphonate Inhibition, crystallization, data collection, and structure deesters,[41, 42] which function as transition-state analogues of termination: Three equivalents of the pincer≠metal inhibitor complexes rac-1 and rac-2 were added to a buffered solution fatty acid ester substrates.

mixture was concentrated and crystallized (see the Experimental Section for details). To obtain suitable crystals of the cutinase≠pincer hybrids, the literature conditions for the crystallization of cutinase[39] had to be adapted. Interestingly, we did not find the crystal forms of free cutinase and or cutinase≠inhibitor complexes known from the literature,[39] but found five new cutinase packing motifs instead. Moreover, the arrangement of the pincer molecules with respect to each other is different (vide infra). Three different crystal structures for cut-1 (cut-1 a, cut-1 b, and cut-1 c) and two for cut-2 (cut-2 a and cut-2 b) cutinase≠ pincer hybrids are described. The molecular structures were solved by molecular replacement methods using the coordinates of a previously solved cutinase structure[45] and two different pincer≠metal structures.[48, 49] A selection of data processing and refinement statistics is shown in Table 1. Crystal packing of cut-1 structures: The different cut-1 crystal structures were all obtained after inhibition of cutinase with pincer≠platinum complex 1 (Scheme 1). The crystal structures of cut-1 a (space group I222) and cut-1 c (space group P3121) both contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit, whereas cut-1 b (space group P21) contained two independent molecules (Table 1). In all three cut-1 molecular structures the (neutral) NCN-pincer≠platinum chloride entity is situated in pocket 1 and in all cases the S enantiomer of the phosphonate is bound to Ser120. The crystal structure of cut-1 a, which was determined at 1.5  resolution, showed head-to-head packing of the cuti-

nase≠pincer hybrid molecule in which the heads of two symmetry-related molecules are in mutual proximity (Figure 1a). The intermolecular Pt∑∑∑Pti distance is 8.9  (i: 1¿x, y, ¿z) and the platinum-coordinated chlorides are located in the region of the bulk solvent. The Pt1∑∑∑Cl1 bond length is 2.4 , which is in agreement with the crystal structure data from a small molecular analogue of a pincer≠platinum complex (Pt∑∑∑Cl = 2.407(1) ).[48] Similarly, in hybrid cut-1 b the enzyme≠pincer hybrids are also packed head-to-head, which results in an intermolecular Pt1∑∑∑Pt2 distance of 8.7  (Figure 1b). The Pt1∑∑∑Cl1 and Pt2∑∑∑Cl1 bond lengths are 2.4 , which is the same as for the cut-1 a molecular structure. For both cut-1 a and cut-1 b, the electron density of the platinum and the chloride have ellipsoidal shapes (Figure 2a). In hybrid cut-1 b, the coordinated chloride of molecule B is located in the region of the bulk solvent, but the one of molecule A is closer to a symmetry related molecule A in the crystal packing. The shortest distances are 5.7 and 5.7  between the chloride and Gly212C and the chloride and Arg208Cb, respectively. Due to the head-to-head packing observed for both cut1 a and cut-1 b, the hydrophobic areas of the cutinase≠pincer hybrids, which consist of the pincer≠metal moiety embedded in the substrate-binding region, are shielded from the aqueous solvent. This feature has been observed previously for several other cutinase crystal structures with and without inhibitor molecules in the active site.[39, 45, 46]

When hybrid cut-1 was crystallized under halide-poor conditions (2 % PEG-1000, 100 mm 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazinyl]ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 6.0), a dinuclear cutinase≠pincer≠platinum hybrid was formed. This surprising molecular structure for cut-1 c (space group P3121) was observed to have a crystal packing system that is different to those of mononuclear cut-1 a and cut-1 b. In cut-1 c, two cationic cutinase≠pincer≠platinum hybrids share one chloride anion to form a {[Pt]¿Cl¿[Pt]} + bridge, which results in a monocationic dinuclear species (Figure 3a). The bridging m-chloride is located on a crystallographic two-fold rotation axis. X-ray data of cut-1 c were obtained up to a resolution of 2.3 . The position of the platinum atom is quite well defined due to its high scattering factor. The Pt∑∑∑Pti distance is 5.2 , which is significantly shorter in comparison to cut-1 a (Pt∑∑∑Pti = 8.9 ) and cut-1 b (Pt1∑∑∑Pt2 = 8.69 ). Due to the coordination bonds of platinum to the bridging chloride, the electron density around platinum has a spherical shape. This indicates that the molecular motion is significantly smaller for cut-1 c than for the cut-1 a or cut-1 b molecular structures. The Pt-Cl-Pti angle is 179.58 with Pt¿Cl and Pti¿Cl distances of 2.7 , which is slightly longer than the distance for the mononuclear pincer≠metal structures (2.4 , vide infra). The torsion angle between the aromatic planes of the pincer≠platinum moieties (C2≠C6 and C2≠C6sym) is ¿23.08. As outlined above, the overall charge of the dinuclear molecular structure for cut-1 c is + 1. The second chloride

that is present in the cutinase≠pincer hybrid cut-1 prior to crystallization could not be located in either the difference Fourier maps or in anomalous dispersion maps (low anomalous scattering power at the given wavelength). Due to this, the second chloride is assumed to be disordered in the bulk solvent region. It is important to note that the formation of m-halide-bridged dinuclear pincer≠metal complexes has been observed for small-molecule analogues before[50, 51] and was found to be an intrinsic property of the NCN-pincer≠metal cationic moieties (in which the metal is platinum or palladium) under halide-poor reaction conditions. The corresponding small-molecule structures of [{PdACHTUNGRE(C6H3ACHTUNGRE(CH2NMe2)22,6}2ACHTUNGRE(m-Cl)] + dinuclear NCN-pincer≠palladium complexes have slightly different Pd2-Cl1-Pd1 angles (134.808[50] and 121.118[51]) and torsion angles (¿95.788[50] and ¿61.328[51]). These observations show that the m-halide-bridged dimer formation can also occur with cutinase≠pincer hybrids in which the covalently anchored cutinase molecules act as giant para-substituents for each of the NCN-pincer≠platinum cations. The low concentration (high dilution) of halide ions may be the driving force for the formation of cationic, dinuclear species in this case. Under chloride-poor crystallization conditions (vide infra), the equilibrium between neutral pincer≠platinum chloride and cationic pincer≠platinum moieties caused by Pt¿Cl bond dissociation will shift to the side of the cationic species. This view is substantiated by the fact that treatment of the small-molecule equivalent, [{M-

For dinuclear structure cut-1 c, the plane of the aromatic pincer ring is rotated % 908 with respect to cut-1 a and the two independent molecules of cut1 b, as can be seen in Figure 2b.

Crystal packing of cut-2 structures: The cut-2 hybrid complexes are formed by inhibition of cutinase with SCSpincer≠palladium bromide complex 2 (Scheme 1). Hybrid complexes cut-2 a and cut-2 b crystallized in space groups P63 and R3 (hexagonal setting), respectively. Both asymmetric unit cells contain one cutinase≠SCS-pincer≠palladium bromide hybrid. For both cut-2 molecular structures, the SCS-pincer≠palladium bromide entity is situated in pocket 2 and only the R-enantiomer of the phosphonate is bound to Ser120. The cut-2 hybrids are packed head-to-head, with three pincer-modified cutinase entities all oriented towards each other (Figure 3b). In the cut-2 a structure, the pincer≠palladium complexes of the hybrid molecules are located in proximity to the 63 screw axis. The electron density map clearly shows two positions for palladium, which indicates positional disorder, that is, two conformations for the pincer≠palladium complex. The minor disorder component has an occupancy of 1=3 and the corresponding bromide is located on the symmetry axis where we observe electron density. The major disorder component places the Br atom at a general position away from the axis; the occupancy of this entity is 2=3. Because in the X-ray diffraction experiment only the average over the whole crystal is observed, our disorder model means that 1=3 of all molecules at the symmetry axis have one orientation whereas 2=3 have the second orientation (Figure 3b). The Pd1∑∑∑Pd1i distance is 4.0  between the major and minor components, whereas the distance between the major Pd positions is 5.6 . By using the same data as for the refinement (wavelength 0.98 ), an anomalous difference map was calculated. The split Pd positions were clearly detectable, but no anomalous signal for the bromides was observed. Therefore, the bromide positions were exclusively derived from the 2Fo¿Fc Fourier map. The Pd∑∑∑Br distance is 2.4  in both the minor and the major disorder components. The packing of the pincer≠palladium bromide moieties in cut-2 b was quite similar to cut-2 a, except that we did not observe disorder. The cutinase≠pincer hybrid complexes were packed in layers parallel to the crystallographic a,b plane, as shown in Figure 4. This layer-packing motif makes merohedral twinning possible with a twofold rotation about the a axis as the twin operation. This twinning was indeed observed in the present crystal and refined with SHELXL by using the TWIN instruction,[54] and resulted in a twin fraction of 0.5. Point group 3 of the crystal lattice can be obtained via a coset decomposition of point group 32 of the twin lattice.[55] The twofold twin axis cannot be a real crystallographic operation because this would result in only half a molecule in the asymmetric unit. For this structure, the pincer entity is located in proximity to symmetry-related molecules and is thus shielded from the bulk solvent. In cut-2 b the Pd1∑∑∑Pd1i distance is 5.3  (Figure 3c) and the Pd∑∑∑Br distance is 2.5 . For one of the pincer arms we do not observe electron density for the methyl group. This is most probably due to disorder because the methyl groups of the SCS-pincer≠palladium complex can adopt two different configurations (axial

move of the C3-linked pincer≠metal complexes observed here is complementary to another study by our group, in which pincer≠metal complexes with a C0 spacer were bound to cutinase.[49] Contrary to findings for the C3-linked structures, modeling studies for the C0-linked pincer≠metal complexes show that the pincer≠metal moieties are immersed in the periphery of cutinase. To get insight into how the protein environment can influence the embedded pincer≠metal complex, the distances between the metal sites and atoms of the protein are of great importance (Table 3).

Discussion
Influence of the pincer≠metal complexes on cutinase and vice versa: To determine the influence of the pincer≠metal guest complexes on the molecular structure of cutinase, we compared the molecular structures of the enzyme≠pincer hybrids in the five different crystal structures with free, uninhibited cutinase.[45] Table 2 shows the root-mean-square deviation, the average deviation and the maximum deviation for the Ca atoms. Additionally, the same quantities are given with respect to all atoms within 10  around the phosphorus in the active site and for all atoms in the whole protein. It becomes especially evident in the calculation for the 10  sphere that the deviations are small. For example, the root-mean-square deviation for the Ca atoms is less than 0.4 . From these numbers we conclude that no major changes occur within the active site due to binding of the pincer≠metal complex. Thus, similarly to other cutinase≠inhibitor structures,[39, 40] the pincer molecules only have a minor effect on the active site conformation. The exposed position and the freedom to

to the metal is Thr44 with a length of 4.8  between Og and the platinum atom. The distances from the platinum and palladium ions to the closest amino acid atoms and to chiral carbon atoms of the protein backbone are given in Table 3. The shortest distances to the protein atoms vary from 4.0 to 6.1 , the shortest distances to chiral carbon atoms range from 5.7 to 7.6 . The ellipsoidal shape of the electron density of the metal atoms in cut-1 a (Figure 2a) and cut-1 b and the disorder of the complete pincer entities in cut-2 a (Figure 3b) indicate a large degree of freedom for molecular movement in the active site. In hybrid cut-1 c the motion of the pincer is significantly smaller due to the pincer≠plati-

num-induced formation of monocationic dinuclear species in the crystal. The motion of the pincer is also restricted by the proximity of symmetry-related molecules due to crystal packing in cut-2 b. The different arrangements of the cut-1 and cut-2 structures are only possible because of the large degrees of freedom of the pincer in the active site. A great advantage of this freedom to move is that the metal center of the guest pincer complex is exposed to the solvent and is available for ligand coordination. This will allow us to perform supramolecular coordination chemistry at the metal center. Due to the large distances from the metal center to the chiral carbon atoms of the protein backbone, a significant chiral induction of the protein backbone onto the metal center with these particular inhibitors is less likely. The latter is of importance when these semisynthetic metalloenzymes are applied as catalysts in organic transformations in which chiral induction might be desirable in some cases. Binding modes of the pincer≠metal complexes: When the different cut-1 and cut-2 structures are compared with each other, different spatial orientations of the SCS-pincer≠palladium and NCN-pincer≠platinum moieties in the active site of cutinase are observed (Figure 5a, b). NCN-pincer≠plati-

Surface representation of the cutinase active site with superposed cutinase molecules. a) The cut-1 (shown in green) and cut-2 (shown in blue) pincer≠metal entities occupy different pockets in the active site of cutinase. Only the pincer≠metal complexes of cut-1 b and cut-2 b are shown as representatives; b) Variety of orientations of the pincer≠metal entities in the active site of cutinase (cut-1 b in green; cut1 c in magenta; cut-2 a minor component in light blue; cut-2 b in blue).

num complexes of all three cut-1 structures occupy one pocket (pocket 1) of the cutinase active site, whereas the SCS-pincer≠palladium moieties of the two cut-2 structures occupy the second pocket (pocket 2), as depicted in Figure 5a, b. A closer look at the binding of the different phosphonates to cutinase reveals that for all NCN-pincer≠platinum cut-1 structures the SP enantiomer of the phosphonate is bound to cutinase, whereas for the two SCS-pincer≠palladium-containing cut-2 structures the Rp enantiomer is bound. In Figure 5a the different stereochemical orientations of phosphorous are clearly visible, with the two C15-C14-C13 spacers of the pincer≠platinum and ≠palladium moieties positioned in the two different pockets. Similarly to other phosphonate inhibitors known from the literature,[39, 40] the phosphonate moieties in the palladium cut-2 structure form an additional hydrogen bond between the ethoxy O2 (Scheme 1) and the imidazole-bound (Ne2) hydrogen atoms of His188 in pocket 1. Due to binding of the other enantiomer, this hydrogen bond is lacking for the platinum cut-1 structures because the ethoxy O2 atom is situated in pocket 2. The different spatial orientations of the pincer≠platinum and ≠palladium complexes bound to cutinase (Figure 5) and their different stereochemistries at phosphorous is a rather unexpected observation. The platinum (rac-1) and palladium (rac-2) inhibitor molecules (Scheme 1) have similar structures and a similar kinetic inhibition behavior[37] and, therefore, the spatial orientation of metal inhibitors 1 and 2 into different pockets in the active site of cutinase is surprising. Although the structures of 1 and 2 (Scheme 1) resemble each other, pincer≠platinum complex 1 is slightly more bulky around the metal center than pincer≠palladium complex 2. The dimethylamino groups of 1 are larger than the thiomethoxy groups of 2. Because the metal centers are situated close to the surface at the rim of the cutinase active site for all cut-1 and cut-2 structures, the subtle differences in steric bulk between 1 and 2 could play a decisive role when the inhibitor molecule approaches the active site and diffuses towards the Ser120 residue. The crystal structural data of the cutinase backbone show that pocket 2, the pocket in which complex 2 is present (cut-2), is slightly narrower than pocket 1 that contains pincer≠platinum complex 1 (cut-1). Due to the slightly greater bulk of 1, this pincer≠ platinum complex can probably approach the active site faster through pocket 1 and therefore mainly yields the pincer≠metal complex with S stereochemistry on phosphorous, as observed for the cut-1 structures. Apparently the smaller palladium inhibitor 2 fits well into pocket 2 and therefore binds to cutinase with the preferred RP stereochemistry. If diffusion to Ser120 through pocket 1 or 2 is considered to be the rate-determining step of the inhibition process, then the binding of the NCN-pincer≠platinum inhibitor in pocket 1 can be explained. We do not know whether or not the R enantiomer of inhibitor 1 also binds to cutinase in solution or if it just does not crystallize under the conditions applied. However, because the inhibition speed of cutinase by complexes 1 and 2

ing the protein crystal in a solution containing a suitable salt of the heavy metal or a more advanced heavy-metal species, such as metal complexes or metal clusters. These methods have in common the fact that there are only weak interactions between the protein and the heavy-metal species, which often results in aspecific labeling or even destruction of the protein crystals. Other methods for the site-specific introduction of anomalous scatterers, such as the substitution of natural methionines by selenomethionines, are limited to in vitro protein expression systems only. Herein, the covalent attachment of a pincer≠metal complex to a protein has several advantages because the heavymetal label can be attached to a specific serine residue of the protein prior to crystallization. In this study we used the pincer≠platinum complex 1 (Scheme 1) as a heavy-atom derivative for obtaining phases for the structure determination of cut-1 a. Because platinum is a strong anomalous scatterer at the wavelength used for data collection, we successfully used the anomalous signal for single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing with SHELXD to 1.5  resolution. Figure 6 shows part of the obtained electron density map and clearly shows the high quality. We also calculated an anomalous difference electron density map for each of the structures. In cut-1 a and cut-1 b structures, this density, as in the 2Fo¿Fc density map,

is comparable[37] and because we added three equivalents of the racemic inhibitor each time, we propose that the binding of the S-enantiomer in the cut-1 structures is caused by slight differences in steric bulk between inhibitors 1 and 2. Currently, we are investigating the inhibition kinetics of rac-1 and rac-2 further to obtain information about the relative inhibition rates of the R and S enantiomers of 1 and 2. Matching of the hydrophobic sites: If the packing of the structures, as described above, is studied in more detail, it becomes clear that shielding of the hydrophobic active site regions from the solvent region is a feature observed for all five crystal structures. For the cut-1 a≠c structures, the pincer-modified hydrophobic active sites of two cutinase molecules are oriented towards each other, whereas for cut2 a and b three active sites are packed head-to-head. This matching of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of cutinase in the crystal structure packing has been observed earlier for native cutinase and cutinase modified with different inhibitors[39, 40] and is also common in the crystal structure packing of other lipases.[41] This hydrophobic site matching positions the pincer≠metal complexes in a hydrophobic environment. Due to the dimeric (for cut-1) or trimeric (for cut-2) aggregates, the accessibility of the pincer≠ metal centers to, for example, solvent molecules or substrates can be limited and controlled by the presence of (an)other cutinase or pincer≠metal molecule(s). Because it is not clear whether the hydrophobic shielding observed here also occurs in solution, we are currently investigating this phenomenon with different techniques (e.g., NMR) in aqueous media. If head-to-head packing motifs occur in solution as well, this can play an important role when different processes, such as ligands binding to or reactions at the metal center of the semisynthetic metalloproteins, are investigated. The observed dinuclear cutinase≠pincer≠platinum hybrid cut-1 c is formed by the coordination of two NCN-pincer≠ platinum monocations to a bridging m-chloride anion. The dinuclear structure of cut-1 c shows that this coordination chemistry, which is observed for small-molecular transitionmetal complexes, can also be performed with transitionmetal complexes attached to biomolecules. Because we are interested in using the described enzyme modification strategy to construct novel semisynthetic metalloproteins with special properties, this was a very important finding because it revealed that non-natural metal complexes still exhibited classical coordination chemistry behavior. Phasing with platinum: One potential application of the pincer≠metal complexes discussed herein is as a heavy-atom derivative that can be used during the structure determination of serine hydrolases. Obtaining crystals of proteins with heavy-atom derivatives can be very laborious because a straightforward general method for the easy and selective incorporation of anomalous scatterers is still lacking in protein crystallography.[57] Traditionally, the introduction of heavy metals into protein crystals is accomplished by soak-

showed an ellipsoidal electron density map for the platinum atom. For cut-1 a this elongation is perpendicular to the twofold symmetry axis. For cut-1 c the anomalous difference map shows a spherical shape for the platinum. For cut-2 a the anomalous map helped to clarify the disorder situation (vide supra). The use of pincer≠metal inhibitors as heavy-atom derivatives for the phasing of raw protein diffraction data has several advantages over conventional phasing-label methods. Because the anomalous scatterer is covalently attached to one unique site, that is, the active site, its position can be used for the tracing of the protein sequence. The transitionmetal label is introduced prior to crystallization, which means that it does not destroy crystals, its binding can be quantified, and it always leads to a 1:1 addition adduct. Because phosphonates are known to bind covalently to lipases and serine hydrolases, which are one of the largest enzyme superfamilies, this phasing label can be used for the structure elucidation of many different enzymes. Application of the phasing method (Figure 6) gave highquality electron density maps for the protein backbone and the cutinase active site, which shows the strength of this methodology. In the future we intend to expand this phasing methodology and use our heavy-atom labels for elucidating structures of novel lipolytic enzymes and as reactivity probes for other serine hydrolases. These studies are ongoing and will be published elsewhere.

Conclusion
Different pincer≠metal complexes attached to the lipase cutinase have been crystallized and five different crystal structures have been solved with high-resolution data. This study shows that pincer≠metal complexes have been covalently and site-specifically bound to the enzyme cutinase. These molecular structures in the solid state are the first examples of pincer≠metal complexes embedded into a protein, and give a detailed insight into the exact positioning of the pincer groups in the cutinase protein structure. Interestingly, the pincer≠platinum inhibitors (cut-1) all bind in the same pocket with the same configuration (SP) at the phosphorus center. However, the pincer≠palladium inhibitors (cut-2) bind exclusively in the second binding pocket with the opposite stereochemistry (RP) at the former phosphonate center. This binding mode and stereochemistry for the cut-1 structures is surprising because the bound phosphonate does not mimic the tetrahedral transition state that is usually observed for phosphonates bound to lipases and which was expected at the beginning of this study.[37] These different binding approaches to the cutinase active site are most probably caused by the differences in steric bulk between pincer≠ metal complexes 1 and 2. We are currently further investigating the inhibition behavior of racemic 1 and 2 with different lipases. When halide-poor crystallization conditions were applied, a novel metal-induced m-chloride-bridged dinuclear coordi-

nation complex was formed, which shows that coordination chemistry with protein-substituted pincer≠metal complexes is an exciting new possibility. The distance from the metal center of the pincer entity to the (chiral) protein environment is quite large, which is apparent from the freedom the pincer entity has to move about its average position and to adopt different orientations. Consequently, large chiral induction in catalytic reactions of the pincer≠metal complex can hardly be expected. Recently, we prepared hybrids in which the C3 linker is absent, that is, the pincer≠metal unit is directly attached to the phosphonate group,[58] and discovered that for these pincer≠metal cutinase hybrids, a closer contact between the pincer≠metal group and the chiral protein environment is established. The exposed position of the pincer≠metal center in the structures described herein can also be used in other systems, such as diagnostic tools in NMR spectroscopy (195Pt is a NMR-active nucleus) or in activity-based protein-profiling applications. Currently, these applications are being investigated by our group. Finally, the results herein show that binding of a pincer≠ platinum or ≠palladium complex to the active site of an enzyme facilitated the ready acquisition of anomalous scattering phases of the heavy atoms during the structure determination of cut-1 a and in the future the use of pincer≠metal complexes as phasing tools for protein diffraction data may simplify the structure elucidation of other hydrolases as well. The intrinsic power of pincer≠metal complexes lies in the fact that they can be easily modified by a wide variety of para substituents,[34] which enables the binding of pincer≠ metal complexes to a wide variety of biomolecules, such as proteins,[37, 58] peptides,[36] and carbohydrates.[35] Currently, we are expanding this approach of covalent and specific biomolecule modification by phosphonates to other protein families, such as other serine hydrolases.[59] Moreover, these different semisynthetic metalloenzymes are currently used in coordination and catalytic studies, in which the specific properties of a protein-embedded transition-metal complex are explored further.

formations. The structures of cut-2 were refined with SHELXL97.[54] The structure of cut-2 a was refined with double conformations for residues I24, S30, T43, S57, S61, R78, S78, S92, K108, S129, and R196. Furthermore, the pincer entity was refined with a double conformation. The minor component has an occupancy of 1=3 and the corresponding bromide is located on the symmetry axis. The major component has an occupancy of 2=3. Hybrid cut-2 b was refined with anisotropic displacement parameters for Pd and Br and as a merohedral twin with (1,0,0/¿1,¿1,0/0,0,¿1) as the twin matrix, which resulted in a twin fraction of 0.5. The relatively high agreement factors for cut-2 b are a consequence of the relatively weak data in the highest resolution shell. Nevertheless the residual electron density in cut-2b is extraordinarily small. The distance and angle restraints for the refinement of the pincer≠metal molecules were derived from the corresponding small-molecule variants [PtClACHTUNGRE(C12H19N2)][48] and [PdBrACHTUNGRE(C10H13S2)][49] for cut-1 and cut-2, respectively. As a proof of the concept that covalently bound organometallic species can be useful for the phase determination of macromolecular protein structures, we used the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method with cut-1 a as an example. 1.5  resolution data were used for the calculation of phases by using the programs SHELXC, SHELXD, and SHELXE as implemented in CCP4.

tion of cutinase mutant N172K (500 mL, 1.098 mm, 0.549 mmol, 1 equiv) in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 8). The yellow solution was left at RT for 8 h and then stored at 4 8C overnight. Prior to crystallization, the cutinase≠pincer hybrids were dialyzed by using a 3.5 kDa cut-off against a five hundred-fold volume excess of Tris-HCl (5 mm, pH 8.0). The hybrid was then concentrated to % 10 mg mL¿1 by using Centricon YM-3 modules (Amicon, Millipore). Inhibition of cutinase N172K with pincer≠metal complex 2: The published inhibition protocol[37] was slightly modified as follows: A solution of 2 in MeCN (16.5 mL, 40 mm, 0.659 mmol, 3 equiv) was added to a solution of cutinase mutant N172K (200 mL, 1.098 mm, 0.220 mmol, 1 equiv) in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 8). The yellow solution was stored in a fridge overnight. Prior to crystallization, the cutinase≠pincer hybrids were dialyzed by using a 3.5 kDa cut-off against a five hundred-fold volume excess of Tris-HCl (5 mm, pH 8.0). The hybrid was then concentrated to % 10 mg mL¿1 by using Centricon YM-3 modules (Amicon, Millipore). Crystallization: Crystallization screens were set up by using the Honeybee 961 (Genomic Solutions) automated fluid-handling system. More than 600 conditions were screened at 18 8C. The crystallization screens used were Crystal Screen 1 & 2, PEG-Ion, PACT, JCGS and Wizard 1 & 2 (Hampton Research) and also diluted variants of these screens, which were diluted 1:1 with ultra-pure water. The hanging drops consisted of equal volumes (150 nL) of mother liquor and protein solution and were equilibrated against 50 mL of mother liquor. These trials yielded approximately twenty promising conditions for cutinase≠pincer hybrids cut-1 and cut-2, which were then further optimized manually. For this purpose we used the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Droplets containing 0.5 mL of protein solution and 0.5 mL of mother liquor were equilibrated against a reservoir that contained 500 mL of mother liquor. Finally, we obtained high-quality single crystals of cut-1 and of cut-2 that diffracted well. Hybrid cut-1 crystallized in three different space groups and cut-2 crystallized in two space groups. All crystals were collected from their drop by using crystal loops (Hampton and Mitogen) and were either directly flash-cooled (cut-1 a, cut-1 b, cut-2 a, and cut-2 b) or transferred to a cryosolution prior to flash-cooling (cut-1 c) in liquid nitrogen. Hybrid cut1 a (space group I222) crystals were obtained by using 20 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000), sodium acetate (100 mm, pH 4.5), and sodium chloride (200 mm). Crystals of cut-1 b (P21) were obtained by using 22 % (w/v) PEG-6000, sodium acetate (100 mm, pH 5.0), and sodium chloride (200 mm). Hybrid cut-1 c (P3121) was obtained by using 2 % (w/v) PEG-1000 and HEPES (100 mm, pH 6.0). Additionally, the cryoconditions were comprised of 20 % (v/v) glycerol. Hybrid cut-2 a (P63) grew with 10 % (w/v) PEG-3350, 25 % (v/v) glycerol, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol (BisTrisP; 100 mm, pH 6.5), and 200 mm sodium citrate. Crystals of cut-2 b (R3) were obtained by using 6 % (w/v) PEG-3350, 30 % (v/v) glycerol, BisTrisP (50 mm, 8.5 pH), potassium thiocyanate (100 mm). Data collection: X-ray diffraction data of cut-1 and cut-2 crystals were collected at 100 K on ID14-1, ID14-4 or ID29 beam lines at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble (France). The obtained diffraction images were integrated by using MOSFLM[60] or XDS,[61] see Table 1. The obtained reflections were scaled by using SCALA as provided in the CCP4 program suite (version 6.0.1).[62] In SCALA 5 % of the data were assigned as Rfree and not used for structure refinement.[63] Structure determination: Hybrids cut-1 a, cut-2 a, and cut-2 b were solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER[64] with the 1.8  resolution structure of cutinase N172K (PDB-code: 1CUA). Hybrids cut1 b and cut-1 c were solved by molecular replacement based on cut-1 a. Model building was performed by using the program COOT.[65] The structures of cut-1 were refined with REFMAC5.[66] For refinement of cut-1 a in REFMAC, we used the TLS option with the protein and the pincer as separate groups. Using this TLS option gave a large improvement in the R-factor and gave a better 2Fo¿Fc electron density map. Residues S30, S57, S61, T80, S92, D111, S129, R138, D139, and R158 in cut1 a and residues R78A and R78B in cut-1 b were refined with double conformations. None of the residues in cut-1 c were refined with double con-
