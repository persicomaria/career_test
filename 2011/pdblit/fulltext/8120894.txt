1Howard Hughes Medical Institute and 2Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, 5323 Harry Hines Boulevard, Dallas, TX 75235-9050, USA Background: Cytochromes P450 catalyze the oxidation of a variety of hydrophobic substrates. Sequence identities between P450 families are generally low (10-30%), and consequently, the structure-function correlations among P450s are not clear. The crystal structures of P450,,rp and the hemoprotein domain of P4 5 0 BM-3 were recently determined, and are compared here with the previously available structure of P450cam. Results: The topology of all three enzymes is quite similar. The heme-binding core structure is well conserved, except for local differences in the I helices. The greatest variation is observed in the substrate-binding regions. The structural superposition of the proteins permits an improved sequence alignment of other P450s. The charge distribution in the three structures is similarly asymmetric and defines a molecular dipole. Conclusions: Based on this comparison we believe that all P450s will be found to possess the same tertiary structure. The ability to precisely predict other P450 substratecontact residues is limited by the extreme structural heterogeneity in the substrate-recognition regions. The central I-helix structures of P4 50te,,p and P4 5 0 BM-3 suggest a role for helix-associated solvent molecules as a source of catalytic protons, distinct from the mechanism for P450ca,,,,,. We suggest that the P450 molecular dipole might aid in both redox-partner docking and proton recruitment for catalysis.

Introduction Cytochromes P450 catalyze the monooxygenation of a variety of hydrophobic substrates [1,2]. P450s have been identified in bacteria, yeast, fungi, worms, plants, insects, fish and mammals [3]. A partial inventory of P450dependent processes would include steroid metabolism [4], drug deactivation [5], procarcinogen activation [6], fatty acid metabolism [7,8], xenobiotic detoxification [9] and catabolism of exogenous compounds as a source of energy [10]. As the list of biologically significant oxidation reactions catalyzed by P450s has grown, so has interest in the relationship between P450 structure and the mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis. In the case of the human enzymes, a better understanding of P450 substrate binding might lead to the rational design of inhibitors and/or precursors that would block or take advantage of the activity of these enzymes in vivo. A great deal of interest also surrounds the possibility of harnessing the oxidative power of these enzymes for industrial purposes, such as the catalysis of stereospecific oxidations in vitro. Finally, 'designer' P450s might offer environmental applications; for example, bacterial hosts might be used to clean up the toxic organic compounds that pollute the world. In all cases, a better understanding of the relationship between the amino acid sequences of P450s and their three-dimensional structures is crucial. The crystal structure of the extensively studied P4 50 ca,,, (CYP101, Pseudomonas ptida) has been available for some time [11]. P4 50a,,, catalyzes the stereospecific

hydroxylation of the bicyclic monoterpene camphor (Cl(H 160). The biochemistry of this enzyme has been extensively characterized, and those results correlated with the high-resolution structures of the isolated enzyme [12] and the enzyme in complex with substrate [13], carbon monoxide [14], inhibitors [15,16] and substrate analogs [17-19], as well as a mutant enzyme [20]. The vast majority of our understanding of P450 structure-function is based on the P 4 50can, model [21].

Extension of the P4 50ca,ll structural paradigm to other P450s has proved difficult, primarily because of the limited sequence identity among P450s (generally 10-30%). This is especially true when trying to model the eukaryotic enzymes, which are membrane bound, unlike the prokaryotic enzymes which are found free in the cytoplasm. The dichotomy between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes goes further than just their membrane status. P450s can be broadly divided into two classes based on sequence homology and the identity of their redox-partner protein. The class I P450s (bacterial/mitochondrial) receive their NADH-derived (bacterial) or NADPH-derived (mitochondrial) electrons from a two-protein redox chain, (FAD reductase-iron-sulfur protein-P450); the class II enzymes (microsomal) receive NADPH-derived electrons directly from an FAD/FMN-containing reductase. These factors combine to generate a superfamily of enzymes whose differences seem to out-number their

similarities. One approach to understanding the structure-function relationships in such a complex family of proteins is to compare the crystal structures of several family members. The premise of such a study is that regions of functional significance will be conserved among the structures, despite the divergence of their amino acid sequences. Towards this end, we have recently determined the three-dimensional structure of an additional class I enzyme (P4 5 0terp [22]), as well as the first structure of a class II enzyme (the hemoprotein domain of P4 50BM-3 [23]). P450terp is a bacterial enzyme (CYP108, Pseudomonas sp.) which catalyzes the oxidation of the monoterpene hydrocarbon a-terpineol (Co H l 8 0) in the catabolic 1 assimilation of this compound as a sole source of carbon
and energy [24]. Like P450cam, P450terp is grouped with

the class I P450s based on sequence homology and its requirement for an iron-sulfur protein as an electron donor. P45 0 BM_3 (CYP102, Bacillus megaterium) catalyzes the oxidation of a variety of fatty acids, and although P450BM-3 is also a soluble bacterial product, it is grouped with the class II P450s based on both sequence homology and its requirement for an FAD/FMN-containing reductase domain as a source of electrons. P4 50 BM-3 is unique among P450s in that the holoenzyme contains both an FAD/FMN-containing reductase domain and a heme-containing P450 domain [25]. The catalytic activity of the holoenzyme could be reconstituted by combining the two individual domains [26]. We report here a comparison of the three P450 crystal
structures (P4 50terp,

and

the

domain of P BM_3) . The enzymes have similar tertiary structures, with a conserved core of secondary-structure elements. The preservation of several key structural features among the enzymes supports many structure-function relationships proposed after study of the P45 0 ca,,,

structure alone. Several previously unappreciated features of P450 structure are also revealed by comparison of the three structures.

The coordinates for all three structures are available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [27] as entries 2CPP, 1CPT and 2HPD respectively. The three structures have 13 ao-helices in common (A, B, B', and C-L) and five P-sheets (31-135). We have taken a departure from the structural nomenclature of Poulos et al. [13] in several instances. First, we have completely renamed the 13-sheets in a format that is more compatible with the PDB convention and that reflects the common motifs of the three structures [now a five-stranded sheet (31), a

three-stranded sheet (3) and three two-stranded sheets (P2, 34, and 135)]. We have also divided the C and E helices (C and C*, E and E*) to reflect the significant deviation from ideal helical structure observed in these regions. Two additional a-helices are observed in P 4 50terp, one near the amino terminus (A'), the other between the K and L helices (K'). P4 50 BM-3 has three additional ot-helices, J' between the J and K helices, and both K' and K" between the K and L helices. We have also identified a short -structure (6) which is common to P450ter and P450ca m . Finally, we refer to the region between te Cys-pocket (the 3-bulge region which contains the thiolate heme ligand) and the K' helix as the 'meander', based on its extended wandering topology. A summary of the sequence positions of the secondary structures in all three molecules is presented in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the overall fold and secondary-structure content of the three structures as ribbon diagrams. The three structures clearly possess the same set of secondarystructure elements in very similar folds. To quantify this similarity, we began our analysis of the structures by determining an optimal superposition of the three molecules. In our analysis of P4 5 0 BM-3 we observed a concerted rotation between the oa and 13 domains of the two

molecules in the asymmetric unit [23]. No analogous rotations were apparent among the ot and domains of the three molecules, and so we elected to treat the molecules as intact units [choosing the more similar of the P4 5 0 BM-3 models (molecule 2) for comparison]. Table 2 shows the root mean square (rms) deviations for the three possible pairwise superpositions, and the pairwise percentage sequence identity. When the rms deviations of these molecules are plotted as a function of their percentage sequence identity, it is clear that these structures have diverged in a fashion consistent with a variety of proteins related by evolution (Fig. 2) [28]. The roughly 2.0 A rms deviation among the cores of these structures is consistent with their -18% sequence identity. This deviation is quite large, and was responsible for the failure of a molecular-replacement solution for
P450terp based on the structure of P450a,,, [22].

P4 5 0 BM-3

We have aligned the sequences of the three P450s based on the structural superposition. Fig. 3 shows this sequence alignment, with the positions of helices, 3-strands, and the highly conserved 3-bulge or 'Cyspocket' indicated. As in Fig. 1, it is clear that the same set of secondary structures is maintained in all three molecules. It is also evident that both P 4 50 terp and P45 0 BM-3

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 1 terminus for the F helix, and a shift of four amino acids towards the amino terminus of the G helix. Because the F and G helices are antiparallel, these motions occur in the same direction. The shift in alignment, which corresponds to one turn of helix, is consistent with the amphipathic nature of these helices, and the tendency of the hydrophobic side chains to interdigitate into the adjacent hydrophobic environment. This observation illustrates a general problem in relating primary sequence information to structure, namely that regions with reasonable sequence conservation, such as the F and G helices, will not always superimpose in space. To describe the distribution of similarity among the three structures, we have determined regional rms deviations of CO positions. These are presented as both a total deviation among the three structures, and as the deviation of each from an 'average structure'. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3. Statistics on the distribution of these regional three-way rms deviations can be used to partition the structures into four categories of structural conservation (see Materials and methods). First, there is a very well conserved core structure in the neighborhood of the heme and extending into the helical domain (color-coded dark blue in Table 3) which includes the central and carboxy-terminal parts of the I helix, strand 1 of 1-sheet 6 (6-1), the Cys-pocket, the L helix and the J helix. A second tier of conservation (cyan in Table 3) includes four strands of the large sheet (131-1, 131-2, pl31-3, 11-4), the C, E and K helices, 132-2, 6-2 and surprisingly, the meander region. These first two groups include all the 'interior' structures. The first tier of less well conserved structure (green in Table 3) includes the B, C*, D and K' helices, the amino-terminal portion of the I helix, -sheets 133 and 4 and -strands 131-5 and 132-1. This group is dominated by surface features of the molecules. The last and most divergent group (red in Table 3) includes the most flexible regions of the structures, as assessed by atomic B-factors, including the amino termini, the A, B', F, G and H helices, and 5. It is of considerable interest that this last group includes the surface helices thought to be involved in substrate recruitment and binding (helices A, B', F and G). Fig. 4 shows the distribution of structural similarity. This representation gives a feeling for the distribution of similarity among the structures, with the conserved regions surrounding the heme, and extending into the core of the ot domain. Equally important, the figure shows the two major foci of variability, the substrate-docking region (helices A, B', F and G), and the proposed reductase interaction face of the molecules (primarily comprising the J/J' and meander insertions in P450BM3 ) Extension of the sequence and structural alignments to other P450s One major goal of this study was to extend our structural results to the many remaining P450s for which no crystal structures exist. The insight gained from the structural superposition of these three enzymes has allowed us to attempt a general alignment of the bacterial, microsomal

The test-set data () were tabulated by Chothia and Lesk [28] in a study which concluded that the rms difference in the core regions of homologous molecules was predictably correlated to their sequence identity. This relationship is shown to hold true for the P450s in this study (A). contain several large insertions compared with P45 0 ca,,. It is noteworthy that, with the exception of the amino
terminus, P4 5 0ca,,, features no significant insertions relative to either P4 5 0 terp or P450BM_3. In a comparison of

these three structures with a large number of P450s, P450ca,,,,, seems to represent the minimal P450 structure. As discussed below, the location of the insertions in

P 4 50terp and P4 50 BM-3 is significant in relation to the function of P450s. The structure-based alignment is not the same as that which would be produced from sequence conservation alone, particularly in the regions of very low sequence identity. The structure-based alignments yield identities which are 3-4% lower than the corresponding identities derived from the sequence alignments (e.g., P 4 50a ,, verm sus P45 0BM-3 16.6% compared with 12.9%, as in Table 2). A dramatic example involves the sequence alignment shifting the F and G helices of P450ca,,, by one helical turn relative to the structural alignment. This results in a sequence shift of three amino acids towards the carboxyl

Note that this amino acid alignment is based on the actual spatial superposition of the structures, and not optimization of sequence conservation. and mitochondrial P450s. Most influential in this alignment was an understanding of the structure of P45 0BM-3. Because of this enzyme's unique status as a bacterial enzyme that is highly related to the microsomal P450s, P45 0BM-3 offers an opportunity to predict the structure of the eukaryotic P450s with a level of confidence not previously attainable. The combination of all three structures enhances the power of prediction by allowing us to develop a consensus for those elements that are well conserved, as well as indicating the regions that are structurally variable or disposable. The multiple sequence alignment shown in Fig. 5 includes some of the best characterized representatives of each of the major P450 families, together with the
sequences of P450cam, P450terp and P 4 50 BM-3. We

comparisons. These errors were primarily in the aminoterminal half of the P450s, where the sequence identity is extremely low (10-12%). To align the identifiable patterns that represent the conserved secondary-structure elements, a large amount of 'hand-fitting' of the sequences was done. As discussed in the paragraphs that follow, this manual alignment was guided by several landmarks that we believe point the way to a correct alignment. This alignment cannot be absolutely correct in the absence of structural information for any of the eukaryotic P450s. The importance of structural information in this sequence alignment is substantiated by the fact that the 'correct' sequence alignment for P450can,, P450terp and P 45 0BM-3 produced by the alignment programs is actually a very poor representation of what we know to be the correct alignment based on structure. This is especially true regarding the loop regions between secondary

structures and in the exceedingly variable regions (amino termini, A helix, B' helix and F-G region). As we saw in the alignment of P450can,, P450terp and P 4 50BM-3, it is quite possible for the optimal sequence alignment of helices to be shifted by units of helical turn relative to the structural alignment. Because of this, the helices with no well-conserved sequence motifs, and a prevalence for insertion and/or deletion at their termini, might easily be incorrectly aligned by ±3-4 amino acids. Such an alignment will obey the conserved pattern of hydrophobicity for the helix, but be structurally incorrect. With these caveats in mind, we have a reasonably high confidence in the correctness of this alignment.

Several observations from this alignment merit discussion. First, the amino-terminal half of the sequences (between the amino terminus and P5) is the most poorly conserved. For the amino termini of the eukaryotic enzymes (before helix A) we have simply used the best sequence alignment, as the structures impart no knowledge about the presumed membrane anchors found there. Whereas the amino-terminal border of the A helices is rather uncertain, the pattern of hydrophobicity in the region indicates that the other enzymes do contain an A helix. The first structural landmark is at the carboxyl terminus of the A helix, where all of the eukaryotic sequences and P4 50 BM-3 share the sequence XG

The tube is colored according to the rms deviation of the C, at each position in the three structures as aligned in Fig. 3. The transition from cool to warm colors (dark blue to light blue to green to yellow to orange and red) represents the progression of structural conservation from most similar to most variable.

(Gly96, Fig. 5), where X is a large hydrophobic residue. This hydrophobic amino acid anchors the carboxy-terminal end of the P 4 5 0BM-3 A helix, while the glycine initiates the turn towards 31-1. We believe that the structures of all P450s will include an A helix, in an orientation similar to that observed in these structures. The region amino-terminal of the A helix could serve as a flexible linker to the membrane-spanning region in the membrane-bound enzymes. This region could possibly contain a helix analogous to the A' helix of P450terp, as it is evaluated to be helical by structure-prediction algorithms, and others have suggested this as the location of the A helix [29,30]. The B' helices are the most variably positioned regular secondary-structure elements among the three structures (8.99 A rms), with very different lengths and orientations as well as very low sequence homology. The alignment of the B'-helix sequences is consequently the most tentative region in Fig. 5. The phenylalanine residue in 31-5 serves to anchor this strand to the core of all three structures, and thus is a good marker for the alignment of the sequences at the amino-terminal flank of B'. The B'-C turn is structurally similar in the three crystal structures, and reasonable homology exists among the eukaryotic sequences and P4 50 BM-3 in this region, which serves to anchor the carboxy-terminal flank of B'. The amino terminus of the C helix is well determined, as this is the location of the conserved WXXXR sequence (Trpl75, Arg179, Fig. 5) where the tryptophan

and arginine interact with a propionate side chain of the heme (see below). The region between the F and G helices is considerably variable, both in length and sequence content, making prediction of the borders between the helices and the loop between them difficult. This region is also the location of the shift between the structural and sequence

and

P BM-3. The distance between the G and I he ices is quite variable among the sequences. This region includes the H helix, which has a fairly consistent sequence motif, surrounded by G-H loop insertions and/or variable length insertions in the 35 region. The region between the F helix and 135 is the most consistently poor region of superposition among the three structures. The region between the I and L helices is the most highly conserved among P450s, and consequently is the region where the multiple alignment is most meaningful. Like P450BM_3, the eukaryotic sequences appear to have an extended J helix and a J' helix insertion relative to the bacterial sequences. The alignment of the K helices is substantiated by the conserved EXXR motif that is invariant in all the sequences that we have examined. The presence of a variable-length 36-1 segment in the three structures is recapitulated in the eukaryotic sequences; the exact location of the gaps being uncertain, but the segment is anchored at one end by the K-helix EXXR motif and at the other end by the

Fig. 5. Multiple sequence alignment of various P450s based primarily on sequence conservation. Using the correctly aligned sequences of P450te r , were aligned in order to maximize sequence alignment, without violating conserved motifs observed in the crystal structures. The approximate locations of the secondary structures, the Cys-pocket and the meander regions in the three known crystal structures are shown above the sequences. Groups f 10 amino acids are separated by spaces, and the alignment position at the end of each row is shown. The single letter amino acid code is used, with gaps in individual sequences indicated by a dot. The consensus sequence is presented as follows: upper-case letter, 100% conservation; lower-case letter, most frequently occurring amino acid in >25% of the sequences; dot, no individual amino acid in 25% of the sequences, or two or more amino acids at an equal frequency in >25% of the sequences. The trivial name, standard nomenclature, and source organism for the sequences presented are: P450Cam (CYP101, P. putida), P4 5 0 te, (CYP108, Pseudomonas sp.), 11 A _Bovin (P450sc c, CYPI 1A1, bovine), 27_Rabbit (P45026 oh , CYP27, rabbit), 21a2_human 'P450c 21 B, CYP21A2, human), 17a_Rat (P450 7 f,, 450 CYP17, rat), a2_Rat (P d, CYP1A2, 4 rat), 2c 1_Rat (P 50M4, CYP2C11, rat),

conserved arginine/histidine propionate ligand in 31-4 (Arg/His453, Fig. 5). Surprisingly good homology is observed in the K'-meander region, which is anchored by several conserved prolines and aromatic residues. Also notable in the meander is a conserved arginine/histidine/asparagine, which is part of the ERR-triad that stabilizes the structure of the meander

region in all three crystal structures (see below). In all P450s the Cys-pocket includes four nearly invariant amino acids. A high degree of sequence conservation extends from the Cys-pocket through most of the L helix, which exhibits the lowest rms deviation among the three structures. The variable lengths of the remaining [3 structures in the three crystal structures, as well as poor sequence conservation, make the alignment in the 33-[4 region

Structure and function of cytochromes P450 Hasemann et al. difficult. This region of the structure was aligned in a manner that preserved the interaction of the conserved hydrophobic residues with the hydrophobic core of the molecule. In addition, the location of prolines and glycines at the turns between -strands is expected to be conserved. We see a wide array of differences in comparing our results to previous eukaryotic P450 sequence alignments
based on the structure of P 4 50 ca,,, alone. The alignment

49

reported by Gotoh [29] is the closest to our results, except for the placement of the insertion in the meander region, which misaligns the arginine/histidine/asparagine residue in the ERR-triad (position 498, Fig. 5). The study by Gotoh included the identification of substraterecognition sites (SRSs) based on the position of
camphor in the binding site of P 4 50 ,,a,. Our alignment

true both in terms of rms deviation and sequence identity. The structures close to the heme include the B'-C turn, the central I helix, 36-1/31-4, the Cys-pocket, and the amino-terminal L helix. The rms deviations between these regions are among the lowest for the three molecules (mean 1.54 A), i.e. well below the rms for the entire structures. Seven of the eight invariant residues and 12 of the 23 strictly conserved residues presented in Fig. 5 are involved in heme binding. Generally, there is a conservation of non-polar residues that establish a suitable hydrophobic environment for the heme. The more strictly conserved residues are involved in propionate coordination or in the formation of structural motifs. The Cys-pocket The heme of P450s is covalently bound to the invariant cysteine found in a -bulge region called the Cys-pocket (Cys5 2 6, Fig. 5). The -bulge appears to serve the role of enveloping the cysteine in a hydrophobic environment. The Cys-pocket region of P450terp is shown in Fig. 6. Three residues besides the cysteine are very strictly conserved [only one substitution at each position in a compilation of 192 sequences [3] (D Nelson, personal communication)]. Two of these are glycines, one of which is in a position that allows the formation of the 3-hairpin turn (Gly522, Fig. 5). The second glycine (Gly528) serves two roles, allowing for a sharp turn from the Cys-pocket into the L helix and for proximity to the heme. The third conserved residue is a phenylalanine that is quite close to the sulfur-iron bond in all three structures. A recent report of mutations at this position indicates that it affects the efficiency of electron transfer, but does not play a critical role [36]. This side chain completes the hydrophobic enclosure of the proximal heme, in combination with other side-chain and mainchain atoms of the Cys-pocket. It has been demonstrated that the redox potential of the heme iron in model systems is sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the heme environment [37]. It is possible that the hydrophobic

is slightly different in SRS-2 and SRS-6, so we would adjust these boundaries for the eukaryotic P450s. Our alignment bears several significant differences from the widely quoted works of Nelson and Strobel [30,31]. Most notable is the completely different placement of the E and F helices, which places a large insertion between helices D and E, rather than between F and G. Our structure comparisons indicate that this variability is almost certain to lie in the F-G loop region. Several other efforts that have relied entirely on automated procedures [32-34], or a combination of automated procedures and manual fitting [35], as the basis for alignment are quite different from ours in multiple respects. Because the combination of the three structures provides a far superior scaffold on which to build a multiple alignment, it is not unexpected that predictions based on the structure of P4 5 0ca,,, alone would be different from ours. Functional implications of the structures Heme binding The most highly conserved regions among the three structures are those involved in heme binding. This is

Fig. 6. Stereoview of the conserved amino acids involved in heme binding, shown for P450,e rp. The -bulge known as the Cys-pocket is shown as a pink tube. The invariant cysteine ligand to the heme iron, and the invariant phenylalanine which completes the hydrophobic shielding of the cysteine-iron bond, are shown. Amino acids that are involved in propionate coordination are also shown. Two of these are found in the C helix (pink coil)': His 10 is a conserved hydrogen-bond donor (position 175, Fig. 5), and Argl 14 (position 179, Fig. 5) is a conserved basic residue which forms a salt bridge to the D-ring propionate. The Cys-pocket amino acid at position 375 (His375, position 524, Fig. 5), and the main-chain nitrogen at position 372 (position 521, Fig. 5) interact with the D-ring and A-ring propionates in all three structures. The conserved arginine (Arg319, position 453, Fig. 5) in -strand 1-4 (pink arrow) forms a salt bridge with the A-ring propionate, and a water (red sphere) hydrogen bonds with that propionate and the amino acid at position 72 of P450terp (Asn72, position 135, Fig. 5).

Fig. 7. Stereoviews of the meander region and the conserved ERR-triad. (a) C trace showing the superposition of the meander regions of P450,terp (green), P4 50 cam (red) and P450 BM-3 (purple). For the purpose of this Figure, the structures were superimposed by optimizing the fit of Cs in the region between the K' helix and the Cys-pocket (positions 482-518, Fig. 5) as well as the Cas of the conserved glutamate and arginine side chains in the K helix (positions 439 and 442, Fig. 5). Side-chain atoms of the conserved glutamate and arginine in the K helix, and the conserved arginine in the meander (position 498, Fig. 5) are also shown. (b) Detail of the interactions that stabilize the recurring structure of the meander regions, shown for P450 terp. The Ca trace of the meander (magenta tube) and a portion of the K helix (magenta coil) are shown. Salt-bridge interactions between the glutamate (Glu306) and arginine (Arg309 and Arg362) side chains, and hydrogen bonds between the arginine side chains and meander carbonyl oxygens are indicated by narrow lines. The C,s of positions 353 and 357 are numbered.

envelopment of the heme is important in establishing the redox potential of the heme iron. Another possibility is that this residue serves a function similar to the invariant tryptophan adjacent to the disulfide bonds of immunoglobulins, shielding the sulfur-iron bond (or sulfur-sulfur bond in immunoglobulins) from solvent-borne reducing agents [38]. Propionate coordination The heme propionate side chains require polar and/or charged residues to accommodate their polarity and negative charge in the hydrophobic interior of the molecule. Further, propionate coordination has been suggested to have an influence on the redox potential of the heme iron [39,40]. This is accomplished by four residues that are well conserved throughout the P450s (illustrated in Fig. 6 for P450te r ) Two are at the amino-terminal end . of the C helix (islO, Argll4 in Fig. 6, positions 175 and 179 in Fig. 5), one in 31-4 (Arg319 in Fig. 6, position 453 in Fig. 5), and one in the Cys-pocket (His375 in Fig. 6, position 524 in Fig. 5). A hydrogen bond is also found consistently (based on distance and geometry considerations between hydrogen-bond donors and recipients, here and throughout the manuscript) between the main-chain nitrogen corresponding to position 372 of P450terp and the A-ring propionate (position 521 in Fig.
5). Interestingly, P4 50 BM-3 does not have an arginine or

charge to neutralize the A-ring propionate. The corresponding position in the other two structures [an asparagine in P450terp, (Asn72 in Fig. 6) and a serine in
P 4 50can] forms a hydrogen bond with the propionate

through a water molecule. In total, both heme propionate groups of each structure are coordinated by one positively charged residue (arginine/lysine) and at least two other conserved hydrogen-bond interactions, either directly or through water molecules. The meander and the ERR-triad A conserved Glu-Arg-Arg triad is associated with the meander region of each of the three structures. The glutamate and arginine from the K helix (Glu439 and Arg442, Fig. 5) are invariant in all P450 sequences, whereas the arginine from the meander (Arg498, fig 5) appears as either arginine, histidine or asparagine in all P450s. The name 'meander' arose from our initial impressions of this region as a structureless wandering of -20 amino acids between the K' helix and the Cyspocket. It is apparent in Fig. 7a, however, that the term meander is a misnomer. In each structure, the ERR-triad forms a set of salt-bridge interactions, positioning the terminal arginine nitrogens (N) to form hydrogen bonds with a series of carbonyl oxygens in the meander (Fig. 7b). This set of salt-bridge interactions and hydrogen bonds results in a highly conserved three-dimensional structure in the three proteins, despite the lack of any typical secondary structures in the region.

histidine at position 453 in 1-4. Instead, a lysine from the 1-5 region (Lys135, Fig. 5) provides the positive

Structure and function of cytochromes P450 Hasemann et al. There is considerable evidence that the ERR-triad is in some way linked to heme binding by the protein. Mutation of the K-helix glutamate [41] or arginine [42-44] or the meander arginine [45] in four separate enzymes has led to the production of completely inactive protein. In the two cases where it was tested, this inactivity was demonstrated to result from the production of apoprotein [41,45]. The meander sequence is located just amino-terminal to the Cys-pocket motif, and consequently the conserved ERR/meander structure is closely associated with the Cys-pocket. We propose that the ERR-triad acts to establish a folding motif in the meander that locks the Cys-pocket in position, assuring the stable association of heme with the protein. As a result, disruption of the ERR-triad leads to the loss of heme binding, and all P450 enzymatic activity. Further, the meander region is located near the heme on the proximal face of the enzyme. This region is the likely site of redox-partner interaction, implying that the structure of the meander might play some role in this protein-protein interaction. Substrate binding The substrate footprints for the three P450 structures are shown in Fig. 8. The footprint is based on the crystallographically determined position of camphor in the substrate-bound form of P 4 50can, [13], on preliminary crystallographic data for substrate-bound forms of P4 50 BM-3 and on the docking of a model of ot-terpineol into the substrate-binding pocket of P450terp [22] as well as preliminary results with a substrate-bound form of P4 50terp. Because the substrates for P4 5 0BM-3 are C 12 -C2 0 fatty acids [25,46], the footprint is larger than for the smaller ring structures of camphor (C1,H 1 6 0) and -terpineol (C1 0H 1 8 0). In an analysis based solely on the structure of P4 50ca,, Gotoh [29] proposed that the eukaryotic family-2 enzymes (e.g. CYP2B1) would adopt a tertiary structure similar to P450an,. On the basis of the position of substrate binding in P 4 50 ca , he also proposed that there m would be six locations in the primary sequence of all P450s that would be potential substrate-recognition sites (SRSs) [29]. He also demonstrated that among the family-2 enzymes these SRS sequences are hypervariable with respect to the remainder of the proteins. Our finding that the overall folds of P450ter and P4 5 0 BM 3 are similar to that of P4 50can, validates Gotoh's premise that such SRSs can be predicted. We can extend the premise to say that, in addition to the sequence hypervariability of the SRSs, there is spatial hypervariability in SRS-1 (B' helix), SRS-2 (carboxyterminal region of the F helix), and SRS-3 (amino-terminal region of the G helix). In contrast, SRS-4 (central I helix), SRS-5 (6-1/31-4), and SRS-6 (34-hairpin) show only limited spatial variability. The superposition of the B' helices (SRS-1) of all three structures, including the extended chain regions at either end of the helices, is shown in Fig. 9a. P 4 50terp is the

The heme of P450terp is shown in order to demonstrate the proximity of these structures to the site of catalysis. (a) B' helices and flanking polypeptide segments. The size and spatial disposition of each helix is quite different, as are the lengths of the polypeptide segments that surround them. (b) F and G helices, and the F-G loop. The orientation of this view is the same as for part (a). The G helices of P450terp and 4 50 P BM-3 clearly follow a different trajectory from that of the G helix of P450cam. This leaves them further from the heme, out of the region which might play a direct role in substrate binding. Similarly, the shorter F helix and F-G
loop of P4 5 0 cam is much closer to the

heme than observed for P4 5 0 BM-3, forming a tighter 'lid' over the substrateaccess channel. Note that the loop between the F and G helices of P4 50 terp was disordered in the crystal, and thus was not modeled. most different, as a result of the amino acid insertions at both ends of the B' helix relative to the other two sequences. This has resulted in the P450 B' helix moving away from the heme to the extent that no helical side chains are predicted to be involved in substrate contact. In contrast, in P4 50 BM-3 and P4 50 ca,1 helical residues are involved in substrate binding. Although substrate-contact residues have been mapped to the B' helix itself [47,48], the highest concentration of contact residues is found in the extended chain at either end of the helices (31-5 to B', 137-144, and the B'-C turn, 162-167; Fig. 5). Several naturally occurring or designed mutations that alter substrate specificity can be mapped to the B'-C turn [49-54]. In several cases, these changes have erroneously been mapped to the B' helix itself, a subtle distinction, but one that merits clarification for the design of future experiments. The F and G helices of all three structures are shown superimposed in Fig. 9b. Again, one observes a high degree of spatial variability, attributable primarily to the different lengths of the F-G loops of the three sequences. P450Ca,, is at one extreme, with one of the shortest F-G regions among all P450s, whereas both P450terp and P4 50 BM-3 typify the F-G regions of most of the eukaryotic P450s (Fig. 5). As discussed above, the position of the F-G region of P450ca,,, is shifted relative to its sequence alignment with P450terp and P4 50 BM-3. This results in the observed ability of the F-G loop of P450can to pack tightly against the underlying B' helix, with the F and G helices at roughly equal heights above the heme. In contrast, the large F-G loop of P4 50 BM-3 has caused the G helix to adopt a conformation above the F helix with respect to the position of the heme. For the regions of P 4 50terp that are crystallographically ordered, the F-G region resembles that of P4 50 BM_3, and we predict that the eukaryotic enzymes will also adopt this topology. The F-G region has the highest thermal parameters for each of the three structures, with particularly extreme values for P450terp, in which the F-G loop is crystallographically disordered. The high mobility of this region most probably allows it to act as a flexible lid over the substrate-binding pocket. Several amino acids in the F helix have been identified as substrate-contact residues in other enzymes [50,55,56].

Structure and function of cytochromes P450 Hasemann et al. Efforts to relate their precise location to a position in the crystal structures are clouded by the structural variability in this region, as cited above. The location of the G helix, above the F helix, removes any potential for Ghelix amino acids to interact with substrate in the active sites of either P4 50 BM-3 or P4 50 terp. For the enzymes with large F-G regions (most P450s), the inclusion of the F-G loop and/or the amino-terminal G helix as an SRS is probably not valid. Thus, only P450s with short F-G
regions (several bacterial enzymes, including P 4 50 ca,,,,) are

53

expected to possess SRS-3. The remaining three SRSs show more limited structural variability. In two of the cases this is probably related to their location in the core of the P450 fold, and reflects the necessity to limit their variability for structural reasons. SRS-4 is located in the central I helix, and SRS-5 is located in the region containing 6-1 and 131-4. As discussed below, the central I helix has been proposed to play a role in proton delivery for catalysis. The I helix is also a member of the four-helix bundle that forms the core of the o-domain. Because of these central roles in P450 structure and function no insertions or deletions are observed in the I helices of any of the P450s. Similarly, the central and carboxy-terminal I helices are among the most conserved regions of the three structures (Table 3). Sequence variation in the I helix has, however, been shown, both by mutation of the conserved aspartate/threonine pair [57,58] and other residues [45,59-61] to play a role in substrate specificity and/or reaction kinetics. The region containing 6-1 and 131-4 is also at the core of the P450 fold, and contains several residues shown to exert an influence on substrate specificity [50,53,54,62,63]. This region contains limited insertions or deletions (1-2 amino acids) as aligned in Fig. 5, and
P450,,,,,a is one amino acid shorter than either P450terp or

To summarize, several substrate-contact regions are the most variable substructures in the three P450s. Variability is most pronounced for the B' and F-G regions of the structure, which together form the majority of the substrate-access channel. The extended structure of the B' helix of P4 50terp and the F-G loop of both P450terp and P4 5 0 BM-3 provide for a much more open or accessible binding pocket than that seen in P450can,. The extremely low degree of similarity in the binding sites of the three enzymes precludes the ab initio prediction of binding-site structures for other P450s. For those with an interest in redesigning P450 specificities, therefore, two primary options remain. First, one can work with one of the three enzymes whose structures are now available, selecting the enzyme with the binding site most similar to that desired in terms of size and accessibility. As a second option, one can work with an as yet structurally uncharacterized enzyme. The improved sequence alignment and general understanding of the substrate-binding structures that arises from the combination of the three P450 structures presented here does allow for a reasonable hypothesis as to the substrate-contact residues in another enzyme. Experiments that target these regions could then be designed to manipulate the substrate specificity of almost any P450. Catalysis The hydroxylation of substrates by P450s can be regarded as a two-stage process (reviewed in [64]). The first stage involves the activation (splitting) of molecular oxygen, with the liberated oxygen atom eventually joining two solvent-derived protons to produce water. The second stage entails hydrogen abstraction from substrate by the iron-bound activated oxygen, producing a substrate radical intermediate [65]. The substrate radical and ironbound hydroxy intermediates then rearrange to produce the hydroxylated product, regenerating the Fe2 + heme iron in the process. The only influence of protein structure at this stage is in stabilizing the substrate in a given orientation, assuring the correct position and stereochemistry of product formation [47]. The splitting of molecular oxygen is generally dependent on P450 architecture in two ways. First, the interaction with the redox-partner protein for the delivery of

P450BM-3 in 6-1. Despite this variability in insertions, SRS-5 is among the most spatially conserved regions (Table 3), probably reflecting its role in heme binding. Finally, SRS-6 is located at the turn in 34, and includes part of 4-1, 6-2, and part of 34-2. As aligned in Fig. 5, this 3-turn region exhibits modest variation in length and composition. The superposition of the three structures in the 34 region is also somewhat worse than average (Table 3).

While all three helices have a disruption in the normal helical hydrogen-bonding pattern which results in a slightly 'untwisted' helix in this region, the location of this distortion is different

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 1 Fig. 11. Features of the central I helices 45 of P 0cam and P450terp which may be involved in the delivery of catalytic protons for oxygen scission. Stereo pairs of the I and F helices are shown as magenta coils, with important sidechain and main-chain atoms included. The hemes are presented as ball-andstick models, with the heme iron represented by a green sphere, and the axial ligand to the heme (either water or hydroxide) shown as a red sphere. Several other relevant waters are also represented as red spheres. Hydrogenbond and salt-bridge interactions are indicated with solid white lines. (a) Atomic coordinates for the substratefree form of P450 cam were used for this figure 12], so that the disposition of the distal axial ligand (hydroxide or water) could be shown. The disruption of normal helical hydrogen bonds is at the 'back' of the helix as viewed here. The hydrogen bond between the invariant threonine (Thr252) and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly248 is shown, as is the hydrogen bond from the carbonyl oxygen of Gly249 to the water which has intercalated into the 'back' of the helix. The conserved acid side chain (Asp251) is also shown, forming salt bridges to Arg186 and Lys178, and hydrogen bonding to Thr185. The water molecules adjacent to Arg186 and Lys178 are at the exterior of the molecule, and represent the closest approach for bulk solvent-derived protons to the central I helix. (b) The I helix of P450terp, viewed from the same perspective as for P450cam in (a). In contrast to P450cam, the disruption of helical hydrogen bonds is at the 'front' of the helix. The hydrogen bond between the invariant threonine (Thr271) and the carbonyl oxygen of Ala267 is shown, as are the hydrogen bonds from the carbonyl oxygen of Thr266 and the main-chain nitrogen of Asp270 to the waters which have intercalated into the 'front' of the helix. Note also that there is a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ala267 and the axial ligand (water or hydroxide) to the heme iron. The conserved acidic side chain (Asp270) is also shown, forming a salt bridge with Lys419, and hydrogen bonding to GIn1 85. As shown for 4 P 50cam, the water molecules adjacent to Lys419 are at the exterior of the molecule, and again represent the nearest source of bulk solvent protons for catalysis.

electrons is in some way modulated by a shift in the redox potential of the heme iron, linked to the presence of substrate in the binding site. The series of P 4 50cam structures has led to the theory that the coupling of spinstate, potential, and substrate binding is achieved by the change in solvation of the substrate-binding pocket [21]. Upon substrate binding, solvent is excluded from the binding site, and the distal axial ligand may be displaced. In those cases where the ligand is not displaced, it is presumed to shift from a strong-field hydroxide ion to a weak-field water molecule. In both cases, the heme iron shifts from a low-spin to a high-spin configuration because of the change in the nature (or presence) of the sixth axial ligand. The redox potential of the iron is also linked to the solvation state of the binding site, increasing upon substrate binding (from -300 mV to -170 mV in the case of P 4 50cam), presumably because the dehydrated porphyrin environment favors the Fe 2+ state. The coupling of redox potential and solvation state of the distal heme is in evolutionary terms advantageous, preventing

the futile expenditure of reducing equivalents into an unoccupied P450, and resulting in the production of hydrogen peroxide and water, rather than oxygenated product. The structures of P450terp and P4 5 0 BM-3 are consistent with this P 4 50cam-,,,based theory. In their substrate-free structures, both enzymes have well-hydrated binding sites, low-spin irons, and presumably are at a low redox potential. On the basis of docking studies with P 4 50terp and a model of oa-terpineol, the substrate-bound enzyme is expected to experience complete desolvation of the active site [22]. The findings of preliminary model building based on data from arachidonate-bound P4 5 0 BM3 crystals is also consistent with this correlation between solvation of the binding site and iron spin-state (RG Kurumbail, SS Boddupalli and J Deisenhofer, unpublished data). The second influence of P450 structure on catalysis is in establishing an appropriate environment for the timely delivery of reactants (electrons, oxygen and protons). The route which electrons take from the redox-partner

Structure and function of cytochromes P450 Hasemann et al. protein to the P450 heme iron will remain unknown in the absence of an atomic structure of a complex between these proteins. Because of its non-polar character, molecular oxygen can diffuse freely to the distal face of the heme molecule as it is needed. One reactant in the activation of oxygen remains, namely protons. Two solvent-derived protons join one atom of oxygen to form water in the balanced P450 reaction. As mentioned above, solvent must be excluded from the P450 active site to avoid the futile production of hydrogen peroxide from molecular oxygen. This means that protons must pass through a protein intermediary to gain access to the iron-bound oxygen. Again, on the basis of the structure of P 4 50can,, models have been proposed which implicate the conserved acidic amino acid and the adjacent threonine at the center of the I helix (positions 382 and 383, Fig. 5) as the amino acids that supply catalytic protons [20,66]. It has also been speculated that the role of the threonine in the center of the I helix is to cause a deformation of the helix which then acts as a pocket for binding molecular oxygen [13]. The structures of P450terp and P4 5 0 BM_3 in this region call for a re-examination of the general applicability of these theories to all P450s. As can be seen in Fig. 10 (and Table 3), CR positions in the central region of the I helices of P450terp and P4 5 0 BM_3 are quite superimposable, whereas the corresponding residues of P4 50 can, are not. In the first descriptions of P 4 50anm by Poulos et al. [11], the existence of an irregularity in the hydrogen-bonding pattern in the I helix was noted immediately adjacent to the heme. The disruption of normal helical hydrogen bonding is also evident in P450terp and P4 5 0 BM 3, though the position of the irregularity has changed. For all three structures, the loss of two helical hydrogen bonds results in the formation of a 'groove' in the helix. Solvent molecules have intercalated into the groove of all three I helices, occupying some of the potential hydrogen-bond interactions lost upon disruption of the helix. For P 450 can,, the groove is at the back of the helix, as depicted in Figs 10 and 1la, with the maximum width of the groove in the helix occurring between C, positions 380 and 384 (numbering as in Fig. 5). For both P450terp and P 4 5 0 BM_3 the groove is at the top and front of the helix, as depicted in Figs 10 and lb, and is widest between C positions 378 and 382, one-half turn of helix before the groove in P450can, The different dispom. sition of the grooves between P 4 50can, on the one hand and P 4 5 0terp and P4 5 0 BM-3 on the other causes a change in the relationship between the heme iron and the conserved acidic residue/threonine pair. It is noteworthy that in all three structures a hydrogen bond is formed between the conserved threonine and the carbonyl oxygen of the amino acid four positions amino-terminal to the threonine. This motif of a distorted helix with water and the conserved threonine satisfying some of the lost helical hydrogen bonds is conserved among the three structures, although the exact locations of the atoms in the motif have changed considerably. Fig. 11 shows the organization of the central I helices for
P4 50 can and P4 50terp (because of the high degree of similarity between P4 50terp and P4 5 0 BM-3 in this region, only P450terp is presented). For P450cam , (Fig. 1 la) it has

55

been proposed that the role of the I-helix disruption is to form a binding pocket for dioxygen binding to the heme iron [11,13]. Because of the shift in local conformation, this pocket clearly does not exist in P4 5 0terp (or P4 50 BM_3) . The pocket is instead occluded by the carbonyl oxygen which is hydrogen bonded to both the water axial ligand and the conserved threonine (Fig. lib). Thus the role of the conserved threonine is clearly not to form a binding pocket for dioxygen in either P4 5 0terp or P45 0 BM 3- Evidence even exists to suggest that the threonine is not critical to the formation of the I-helix distortion of P4 50can,, in that the crystal structure of the Thr-Ala mutant at this position [20] retains the distortion in the helix. A model for proton delivery in P 4 50Cam has evolved to include the delivery of a proton to iron-bound molecular oxygen via the hydroxyl oxygen of the conserved threonine [20,66,67]. The threonine side chain is proposed to adopt a new torsion angle, bringing the hydroxyl hydrogen into a position where it might interact with the reduced oxygen intermediate. The situation in P 4 50terp and P4 5 0 BM-3 is different, however, as shown in Fig. 1lb for P4 50terp. In these cases, the atom closest to the axial ligand is the carbonyl oxygen that is hydrogen bonded both to the conserved threonine and to the water axial ligand (at a distance of 3.0 A for P450terp and 2.7 A for P4 5 0 BM-3) . At no torsion angle is the threonine hydroxyl oxygen closer than 4.1 A to the axial ligand in either P 4 50terp or P45 0 BM-3. The proximity of this carbonyl oxygen to the axial ligand implies that it may play a role in the diffusion of a proton to the activated oxygen. The source of this proton in the case of P4 50terp or P 4 5 0 BM-3 could be either the conserved threonine (as in P4 50can,) or the ordered solvent found in the I-helix groove. The function of the conserved acidic residue (glutamate or aspartate) adjacent to the conserved threonine in nearly all P450s remains elusive, despite the addition of the structures of P 4 50terp and P4 5 0 BM-3. Consistent with the simple observation that it is highly conserved among P450s, several mutagenesis studies have demonstrated diminution in activity when the acid is replaced [59,61,66,68]. Gerber and Sligar [66] have proposed a distal-charge relay system, in which the aspartate of P4 50 cam, adopts two alternative rotamer conformations: its crystallographically observed position exposed to solvent; and a position in which it might donate a proton directly to the conserved threonine, acting as a catalytic base. The need for such a model for P 4 50can, arises from the lack of another donor that could supply solventderived protons to the threonine. In both P 4 50terp and P4 5 0 BM-3 this need is obviated by a series of hydrogen

56

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 1 bonds through the water(s) found in the groove in the helix, which might act as a conduit for catalytic protons [22,23]. Although some solvent molecules are also associated with the P450a,,, I helix, they do not have the same access to bulk solvent as in P450terp and P4 5 0 BM 3, because of the different locations of the helical distortion. Furthermore, in all three structures, the acidic side chain is involved in interactions that would be disrupted in each cycle of proton delivery (hydrogen bonds and/or salt bridges, Fig. 11). The energy consumed in such a maneuver seems to preclude this as an attractive model for proton delivery, especially in the cases of P4 50terp and P 45 0 BM_3, where no such motion need be invoked. Although we cannot rule out the distal-charge relay mechanism (particularly for P4 50 a,,, where there is a need for a proton conduit), we propose that the acidic side chain primarily plays a structural role via the interactions noted above. It may also play a role in the electrostatics of the enzyme, as discussed below. In total, these findings offer an interpretation of a basic paradox in the P450 literature. Mutations of the conserved threonine in several enzymes have produced a variety of results. Replacement with serine generally results in the most subtle change [43,58,59,67,69]. The effect of other amino acid substitutions ranges from the virtually complete uncoupling of some enzymes to the production of enzymes with improved catalysis [43,58,67,69]. In addition, some naturally occurring P450s activate oxygen and catalyze hydroxylation reactions despite the absence of the conserved threonine or a serine [CYP3A1 (pcnl), CYP56 (Dit2) and CYP7 (Choll7a) [3]]. On the basis of the P450canm paradigm, the conserved side-chain hydroxyl plays a critical role in efficient catalysis, presumably because of its role in proton delivery. Should the arrangement found in P4 50terp and P4 50 BM-3 prove to be generally applicable, however, the threonine would be less necessary than previously thought. Thus enzymes with no threonine or serine (either mutant or natural) might function quite well by substituting protons derived from the ordered solvent molecules in the I-helix distortion. The proximity of the carbonyl oxygen noted above might assist in the diffusion of this proton from the groove in the helix to the activated oxygen. Thus a spectrum of possibilities for proton delivery might exist. At one end of the spectrum, the threonine side chain of P4 50 a,,m plays an obligatory role in delivering protons, possibly via the distal-charge relay Fig. 12. Electrostatic potential at the molecular surfaces of (a) P4 50terp, (b) P4 50am and (c) P4 5 0 BM-.3 The consistent positively charged (blue) patch near the center of the face of each molecule is located directly above the heme, and is a good candidate for the docking site between a P450 and its electron-donating redox partner.

Structure and function of cytochromes P450 Hasemann et al. involving the conserved acidic residue. In the center of this spectrum are P450terp and P4 50BM_3, for which the role of the threonine is more nebulous. Solvent-derived protons can be directly withdrawn from the hydrogenbond network in the I-helix groove, and the shortest route of diffusion to the heme iron passes by the carbonyl oxygen, and not the threonine side chain. At the other end of the spectrum are those enzymes with no threonine at all, where a proton is delivered in the complete absence of a hydroxy side chain. Perhaps a unifying theory would state that the conserved carbonyl oxygen/ threonine hydrogen bond acts as a gate for the regulated transfer (or diffusion) of a proton to the axial ligand. The proton might pass through this gate via the carbonyl or hydroxy oxygen, whichever is closer to the axial ligand. Rules for predicting which conformation the I helix of a given P450 will adopt, or whether only two such conformations exist, remain to be determined. Redox-partner interactions A considerable amount of experimental evidence suggests that P450s interact with their electron donor at the proximal face of the molecule. Manipulation of ionic strength shows that a complementary charge interaction is involved in redox-partner docking [70-72]. Mutation studies indicate that the P450 provides positively charged residues [44,73-76], whereas the electron donor has conserved negative charges [77-80] which are critical for proper interaction of the partners leading to electron transfer. On the basis of these findings, we analyzed the electrostatic properties of the three models [81]. Fig. 12 shows the electrostatic potential at the proximal surface of each of the P450s. It is clear that a common region of positive charge is centered over the Cys-pocket of each molecule (the closest approach to the heme iron in each case). The distribution of the amino acids that contribute to this positive charge differs between the two class I enzymes (P450terp and P450can) and the class II enzyme P45 0BM-3. In the class I enzymes, part of this positive field is attributable to positively charged amino acids that interact with the negative charge of the heme propionates (one or more of positions 175, 179 and 524; Fig. 5). Both enzymes have a positive charge at the same position in the L helix (Arg/Lys533). The remaining charges occupy similar regions in space, but not the same positions in the sequence. These include a B-helix residue (Argl22 in P450cam, Lys126 in P450 rp) and a meander residue (Lys500 in P450cam, Arg502 in P450terp). Although the distribution of charge observed in Fig. 12 looks similar for P4 5 0 BM-3 and the two class I enzymes, several amino acids are in different positions. Analogous positive charges coordinate the propionates (positions His179 and Arg524), and a meander residue lies in a position analogous to the class I meander charge (Lys517). In contrast to the class I enzymes, however, the positive charges in the P4 50 BM-3 B helix face away from this region, and the amino-terminal L helix contains no positive charges. Instead, the charges that occupy the analogous

The plane is colored by an interpolated value for the electrostatic field on a grid at the surface of the plane. The charge separation that leads to the molecular dipole (yellow arrow) is evident. The proximal (redox-partner docking) and distal (substrate access) faces of the protein are indicated. positions in space are found in the J' insertion (Lys425, Lys428 and Lys431). Differences in charge distribution and topology of the proximal face associated with the J' and meander sequence insertions of P4 5 0 BM-3 might be invoked to explain the difference in redox-partner association between the class I and class II enzymes in this study. It would be even more satisfying if these insertions were found in all P450s which accept electrons from an FAD/FMN reductase, and would then explain the redox-partner association for all the P450s. Unfortunately, the existence of a J' insertion is not solely characteristic of class II enzymes, but rather is common to all the eukaryotic enzymes, both microsomal and mitochondrial (Fig. 5 and [3]). The mitochondrial enzymes accept electrons from the iron-sulfur protein adrenodoxin, which is similar in amino acid sequence to the bacterial iron-sulfur redoxins, although these redoxins will not substitute for one another in electron transfer. The microsomal enzymes interact with an FAD/FMN-containing reductase which is unrelated to the iron-sulfur proteins. Thus, the changes in charge distribution and topology associated with the J' and meander insertions cannot be the common characteristic of enzymes that interact with an FAD/FMN reductase. While analyzing the charge character of the proximal faces of the enzymes, we discovered a common asymmetric distribution of charge in all three enzymes. This charge distribution leads to the formation of a 'molecular dipole' which has probable consequences for the function

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 1 of P450s. Fig. 13 displays this dipole for P4 5 0 BM-3' though the qualitative features of the P4 5 0 BM-3 charge distribution are the same in all three enzymes. We propose that this dipole might act in two ways to promote P450 catalysis. First, this charge distribution would accelerate the diffusion-limited interaction of the P450 and its redox partner. The.electrostatic field would steer the negatively charged region of the electron donor away from the negatively charged distal face, and towards the positively charged proximal face of the P450. Because of the solvent shielding effect, the dipole is probably not observable to the incoming protein at a great distance, but once in close proximity the dipole would clearly assist in the correct alignment of the two molecules. Once oriented in this way, the negatively charged region of the redox partner would be drawn into close contact by the electrostatic field of the P450 to achieve the correct fine positioning for electron transfer. The dipole might assist P450 function at a second level as the orientation of the dipole is consistent with the electrochemical flow of the reactants involved in the activation of oxygen. Thus, both the proximal-to-distal flow of electrons from the redox-partner protein and the distalto-proximal flow of protons from solvent will be positively influenced by the electrostatic field of the P450. Electrostatic guidance of substrates has been proposed to be extremely important for both acetylcholinesterase [82] and superoxide dismutase [83]. The hypothesis that these findings might be extended to the smaller charged particles (electrons and protons) being recruited to the P450 active site is testable. Experiments to alter the surface charge distribution of the distal face of the enzyme without affecting the folding and stability of the enzyme should be possible. A limited form of such an experiment has already been performed. The position and charge of the conserved acidic residue at the center of the I helix are consistent with the dipole moment of the enzyme. Several enzymes have been mutated to remove this acidic residue, resulting in decreased activity of the enzymes (see above). It will be instructive to re-evaluate those results with an eye towards the effect on the molecular dipole of the enzymes studied. Summary of the overall impact of the structures One of the major implications of this study is quite simple. Eukaryotic P450s undoubtedly look a lot like the bacterial enzymes. This can be stated with confidence because of the similarity of the sequence of P4 5 0 BM-3 to the microsomal sequences, and the concomitant similarity of the structure of P4 5 0 BM-3 to the structures of
P 4 50erp and P450,,,a. The structure of P450ca,,. might

structural identity with -2.0 A rms deviation in their cores. There should also be some entirely unpredictable variety in their substrate-binding regions and amino termini, as well as in their various sequence insertions. The membrane-bound enzymes presumably have an additional membrane anchor at their amino terminus, but we believe that the remainder of the P450 fold shown here will be conserved, beginning with the A helix. Several membrane-bound P450s have been altered at their amino termini and have been found to remain membrane-associated despite expression of protein lacking the aminoterminal anchor [84,85]. The sequence alignment based on our structural comparison suggests that there are no additional structural motifs found in the membranebound enzymes that might act as an additional conventional membrane anchor. We suggest that an as-yet undetermined region of the membrane-bound enzymes must contain a hydrophobic patch, superimposed on the common P450 fold, which might aid in stabilizing membrane association. Our results imply that the region that is of greatest interest for the structure-function relationships of the P450s, namely the substrate-binding region, is extremely structurally diverse. We believe that because of this diversity, sequence alignments alone will not be reliable predictors of substrate-contact residues. This structural diversity makes teleological sense from the point of view of generating a variety of binding specificities. It is however inconvenient for those who would like to redesign P450 specificity for the reasons speculated on at the beginning of this article. The concept of SRS regions remains valid, however, and experiments targeted to these regions might still prove valuable. Finally, we have discovered several unexpected features of P450 structure. These include the ERR-triad, which encodes a motif important for the structure of the meander region and the 'folding in' of the heme, or in stabilizing the folded holoenzyme structure. In addition, the demonstration of a common molecular dipole provides a new target for P450 structure and function studies. Despite the availability of three crystal structures, the exact role of the conserved acidic residue/threonine pair in the I helix, and the associated irregularity in helical structure, remains a question yet to be answered.

Biological implications
Cytochromes P450 catalyze monooxygenation reactions for a variety of medically important substrates including steroid hormones, prostaglandins, procarcinogens, and a variety of pharmacological compounds. P450s comprise two classes: the bacterial (soluble)/mitochondrial (membrane-bound) enzymes (class I), and the membrane-bound eukaryotic microsomal enzymes (class II). Because the majority of the medically relevant enzymes are membrane-bound class I or class II enzymes, efforts directed towards the

be thought of as the 'minimal' P450, in that its sequence is among the shortest, and the structure consequently has very few extra loop regions relative to the other P450s. The remaining P450s will fold the same way as the three enzymes presented here, with variations on the theme in loop regions. This is not to say that we believe that the atomic structures of new P450s are predictable. Quite the contrary, they are expected to have a similarly poor

from Bacillus megaterium is however an exception, in that it is a soluble class II enzyme. Our comparison of the crystal structures of
P450cam, P450terp (isolated from separate Pseudo-

monas species, having catalytic activity for camphor and ac-terpineol respectively), and P4 5 0 BM-3 reveals that their overall folds are quite similar despite their low sequence identity. The fact that P4 5 0 BM-3 is a class II enzyme whereas P450,a m and P450terp are class I enzymes allows for a direct comparison of the structure-function relationships for the two P450 classes. Based on knowledge from this structural comparison, we have made a more confident alignment of the remaining class I and class II P450 sequences than was previously possible. This improved alignment should assist in the interpretation of structure-function relationships of the other biologically important P450s. The conserved regions of the enzymes are found in the core of the protein, probably representing the conservation of regions important to correct protein folding and binding of the heme cofactor. Unfortunately, the substraterecognition regions of the proteins are the most structurally divergent, involving large-scale shifts of the B', F and G helices. This casts significant doubt on our ability to precisely predict the set of amino acids that determines substrate specificity for other P450s whose three-dimensional structures have not been determined. However, it should now be easier to achieve the goals of designing specific inhibitors or agonists of medically relevant P450s, or redesigning the specificity of potentially useful enzymes for industrial oxygenation chemistry.

between the resulting rms deviations was only on the order of +0.1 A, suggesting that this choice was, in any case, not particularly critical. The sets of Ca pairs used to align the structures and calculate the rms deviations presented in Table 2 are: P450tcr/P450ca,, (1-5/14-18, 12-16/24-28, 30-33/44-47, 37-44/50-57, 49-73/60-84, 76-80/85-89, 100-118/98-116, 126-145/124-143, 148-172/145-169, 176-185/170-179, 186-190/179-183, 216-222/201-207, 238-247/219-228, 250-313/231-294, 314-404/294-384, 405-410/387-392,

Given the superposition of the three models, the structurebased sequence alignment of Fig. 3 was prepared. The results of Isq_improve include a pairwise listing of the positions used in the calculation of the transformation, and these positions were aligned in Fig. 3. A visual inspection was made for regions that were not included in the transformation (the loops), and structurally analogous (but spatially separated) regions were aligned. Finally, for the two regions of extreme structural variability (amino terminus to the start of the A helix, B' helix), a sequence alignment that was consistent with the structures was performed.

Rms-deviation calculations
Given the three-way superposition generated above, and the structure-based alignment of the sequences, a deviation between aligned positions could be calculated. Briefly, a program was written which calculated deviation statistics (defined below) for each position in the structural alignment that had three atoms to compare (i.e. no calculations were done at positions that include a gap). The overall number reported in Table 3 includes all such positions, whereas the regional statistics were calculated for subsets of the alignment. The three-way rms reported in Table 3 was calculated as: E(AM[AAB+ABC+AAC]/3N) where M is the set of N positions (A, B and C) compared, and Aab=[(xa-xb) 2 +(y,-yb) 2 +(za-zb)2 ]. Individual terms of this summation were used to color code the Ce, positions of Fig. 4. The individual rms values reported in Table 3 (i.e. Cam rms, Terp rms and BM-3 rms) each represent deviation of the individual structures from a mean structure, and are calculated as: [I,M(AAI1)/N where M is the set of N positions (x, y and z), and AAml=[(X-Xm) 2 +(y-y )2 +(Z-zm) 2 ], with (x,),y,,z) being the mean coordinate for that position in the three structures. The regional rms deviations were partitioned into four groups based on their statistical distribution. The mean () and standard deviation (). were calculated for the distribution of individual regional rms scores for the regions which are

Materials and methods
Structure superpositions and structural alignment
The structures were superimposed using the lsqexplicit and Isqimprove routines in the program O [86]. The Isqexplicit function simply superimposes two structures based on the leastsquares fit of two atom lists. Typically, a stretch of analogous Ca positions in the I helix was supplied. The Isq_improve routine improves a starting transformation by iteratively seeking to maximize the number of atom pairs included in the leastsquares calculation (below a threshold deviation), while minimizing the rms deviation between those atoms. The exact algorithm has not been published. We found that the result was quite insensitive to the seed transformation, given that it was reasonably close to correct. Because the procedure only works in a pairwise manner, the potential exists for bias in the result based on the choice of structure pairs. We tried all pairwise superpositions, and always found that the structure of P450ter, was the 'middle' structure. Therefore, the superposition presented in Table 3 used the CO, positions of P4 50tep as the target structure, with the C, positions of both P4 5 0 ,,,,, and P4 5 0 BM3 superimposed onto it. In any combination, the variance

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 1 represented in all three structures (i.e. not A' and K') and excluding the extreme outliers (A, B' and G). Thus 31 terms contributed to a mean rms = 2 . 2 1 with a standard deviation r=0.69. The four basic groups reported in the text and color coded in Table 3 are then: rms<1.52 (-r) [dark blue], 1.52 (jI--c)<rms<2.21(.) [cyan], 2.21 ()<rms<2.9 (p+cr) [green], rms>2.9 (+cr) [red]. Multiple sequence alignment Several efforts were made to accomplish an automated multiple alignment. The program PILEUP in the GCG package [57] was used, but, invariably, obvious problems could be identified, despite the judicious application of various combinations of input parameters. We also attempted multiple alignments based on the sequence profile and three-dimensional profile methods of Eisenberg and colleagues [87], as well as the multivariate combination of profiles [88]. The profile methods also failed to provide reasonable alignments in the amino-terminal half of the protein. We finally resorted to 'hand-fitting' the sequences in the program LINEUP, also from the GCG package. The starting set for the multiple alignment included the sequences presented in Fig. 5, as well as the following; P4 50 pinF1 (CYPI103, Agrobacterium tunmefaciens), P450 c (CYPIAl, rat), P450 a (CYP2AI, rat), P4 5 0 LM2 (CYP2B4, rabbit), P4 50pBC2 (CYP2C2, rabbit), P4 50 db1 (CYP2D6, human), P4 50 LFI (CYP2FI, human), P4 50olf , (CYP2GI, rat), P4 5 0 Lung 1 (CYP4BI, human), P450c21 (CYP21A1, bovine), P4 50 14DM (CYP51, yeast) and P4 5 0 ALKI-A (CYP52A3, fungus). All the sequences were obtained from the SWISSPROT database via the GCG package. Original references for these sequences can be found in the P450 superfamily summary of Nelson et al. [3]. The sequences were initially aligned with PILEUP, and the multiple sequence file loaded into the line-up program. After repairing the misalignment of the sequences of P4 5 0 can,, P450terp and P4 5 0 BM-3, the remaining sequences were realigned, using conserved structure/sequence motifs from the structure comparison as guideposts. The sequences presented in Fig. 5 are a subset of this original alignment, representing the most widely familiar P450s. Electrostatic calculations Charge surface representation and molecular dipole calculations were accomplished with the program GRASP [81]. GRASP includes a simplified Poisson-Boltzmann solver, which yields qualitatively reasonable, but not necessarily quantitatively accurate, electrostatic potential. Because of this, the interpretations of the electrostatics among the three molecules are meant to be comparative only (i.e. distribution of electrostatic field potential and the direction of the dipole are correct, but their absolute magnitudes are not precise). Default values were used for most parameters, including values of 2.0 and 80.0 for the dielectric constants of the protein and solvent regions respectively, a water radius of 1.4 A, and an ionic radius of 2.0 A. The ionic strength was set to physiological conditions (0.145 M). An attempt was made to identify histidines that would probably be ionized as a result of local shifts in pK a . This was accomplished with Delphi [89,90], using a strategy suggested in the documentation for that program. The shift in plK, (ApKa) was calculated between the histidine as found in the fully charged protein and as it would be were it the only charged residue. The ApK a calculated in this way was clearly not quantitative (ranging from -7 to +66). The pK a was however consistently qualitatively valid, suggesting, for example, that the histidines in contact with the heme propionates would be charged whereas solvent-exposed histidines would be neutral. This ApK, was used as a guide, with only histidine nitrogens at the positive extreme of the ApK a range being charged. Because the net charge on each molecule is not zero, the 'molecular dipole' is not a pure dipole. The actual procedure is to place a monopole equal to the excess charge at the chargeweighted average position of that excess charge. A dipole is then calculated for the magnitude of the balanced charge multiplied by the distance between the charge-weighted average position of the positive and negative charges. This is then referred to as the 'molecular dipole'. The dipole vector shown here has its tail midway between the charge-weighted average positions of the positive and negative charges, and parallel to the vector between them.
