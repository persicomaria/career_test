Abstract Conformational studies of synthetic peptides corresponding to the pore-forming regions of voltage-fated sodium channels show a high tendency for P-sheet conformation when interacting with lipid vesicles, as revealed hy circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy. These observations have guided our choice of possible molecular models for the P-region peptide of domain II of voltage-gated sodium channels: three alternative P-hairpins, with differing turn assignments. or an Lu-helical hairpin. After generation of models by distance geometry-based methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were run. in the absence of explicit solvent molecules but employing three different dielectric constants. to explore possible conformational preferences. The simulations in the different dielectric environments suggest that a a-residue turn with the sequence LCGE yields more stable P-hairpins. The MD results suggest that the SSI part of the peptide may bc more stable as an u-helix, whereas the SS2 part tends to adopt a p-conformation. 0 I997 Elsevier Science B.V.

After the determination of their primary structures [j], analysis of hydrophobicity profiles [4] allows the definition of four homologous domains (I to IV, with homology around 60%). each of which is composed of five hydrophobic segments (S I. S?. $3, SS and 5%). a highly charged segment S4 which is the main voltage sensor component [S]. and a loop between SS and S6 referred to as the P-region. (also HS OI SS I-SS2).

brane twice, is a primary component of the channel lining, responsible for the sensitivity to blockers and the ionic selectivity [6,7] of the channel. Several molecular models have been designed to explain the organisation of these transmembrane segments and their relationship to channel function [8-l 11. While site-directed mutagenesis provides an extremely powerful tool to test relationships between sequence and function, it remains almost impossible to obtain high-resolution structural data for the entire channel protein. An alternative approach is the use of synthetic peptide fragments of channels. Structural data on synthetic peptides can be obtained e.g., by circular dichroism (CD) or 2D NMR [ 12,131, while functional properties can be derived from planar bilayer studies. Such data can be employed to discuss plausible models [14-171. In a previous paper [18], we focused on synthetic peptides mimicking the P-regions of the voltage-gated sodium channel from an electric eel. Their secondary structure was characterized using circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in trifluoroethanol that yielded approximately equal contents for a-helical and P-sheet conformations. Similar experiments carried out in the presence of phospholipid vesicles demonstrated a significant increase in the P-sheet content with a concomitant decrease in the content of a-helix. The ability of these synthetic peptides to insert in planar lipid bilayers and form ion permeable channels was also investigated. The formation of well-defined conductance levels indicated that synthetic P-region peptides interact and self-assemble in lipid systems. Related work on sodium channel P-region peptides employed fluorescence energy transfer experiments to demonstrate the capacity of P-region peptides to co-assemble in lipid bilayers [ 191. In the light of these results, we have investigated possible models of the secondary structure of a peptide with a sequence corresponding to the P-region of the second domain of the eel voltage-gated sodium channel, referred to as Pi, [3]. The P,, peptide is modelled either as a membrane-spanning P-hairpin with three different turn lengths or as an a-helical hairpin. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed in different dielectric conditions reflecting the various environments in which CD data had been collected. The results are discussed in

terms of secondary structural models for P-region peptides in isolation and within self-aggregated channel-forming motifs.

2. Methods 2.1. Progrums Model building and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out using Xplor V3.1 [20]. Distance geometry and simulated annealing (DG/SA) regularisation were performed with the PARALLHDG parameter set for all-hydrogen representations in distance geometry calculations. During Stage 4 refinement (see below) the CHARMM PARAM parameter set [21] was employed with apolar hydrogen atoms represented by extended heavy atoms. Models were displayed and examined using Quanta V4.0 (Molecular Simulations, Waltham, MA). Diagrams were drawn using Molscript [22]. Model stereochemistry was checked using Procheck [23]. 2.2. Generation

of structures

For each of the four configurations examined, 100 structures were generated by a four-stage modelling process, of which Stages 3 and 4 are similar to a previously described simulated annealing via restrained molecular dynamics method [24]. Each configuration was defined by two restraints files: (a) distance restraints file that determined the hydrogen bonding pattern for a given configuration; and (b) a torsion angle restraints file that determined the secondary structure. Restraints remained active during all four stages of model generation. Stage I of the procedure employed distance geometry to generate 100 structures defining coordinates for backbone and C p atoms only. Such ` sub-embedding' requires only a molecular structure file (i.e., a description of the covalent structure), and the two restraints files to generate the structures. Stage 2 was a ` full-embedding' process in which coordinates for sidechain atoms were generated from the backbone and C/3 atom structures generated above. Stage 3 is a simulated annealing regularisation of the structures produced in Stage 2. Briefly, during a burst of molecular dynamics (3 ps) at 2000 K, weights applied to

The system was then cooled to 100 K in SO K steps (total simulation time 3.8 ps). while a repulsive van der Waals term is gradually introduced. Prior to further refinement, the 100 structures per configuration produced by Stage 3 were reduced to 20 structures by a selection of those models that exhibited the fewest dihedral angle and distance restraints violations. These models were refined in Stage 4. a short molecular dynamics run in which elcctrvstatic effects were gradually introduced. Stage 4 consisted of cooling from 500 to 300 K over -I ps. during which Ca atoms were released from their initial positional restraints, and during which sidechain atomic partial charges of polar and charged residues were scaled up from 5% to 42% of their full values (as given in the PARAMl9 parameter setl. Structures were then subjected to 5 ps of unrestrained molecular dynamics at 300 K and 2000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimisation. Each bet of 20 structures was subjected to two

Secondary structural motifs are designated as follows: cu4: helix-loop-helix; p2: P-hairpin with 2 residues in the loop (GE); 63: /z-hairpin with a 3 residue loop (LCG); p4: P-hairpin with 4 residue loop (LCGE). For distance restraints, a square-well potential with a force constant of 30 kcal mol-' A-' is applied between the specified residues-the restraint operates between the carbonyl oxygen of the first residue and the amide hydrogen of the second. For dihedral angle restraints, a force constant of 4 kcal mol- 'k operates for those residues in the desired conformation. All restraints are given as the target value and allowable deviation.

MD was performed as described in previous studies [25]. Briefly, the system was heated to 300 K in 50 K steps over a period of 3 ps, followed by an equilibration of 22 ps during which velocities were resealed, such that the effective simulation temperature remained in the window 290-310 K. The simulation phase consisted of 300 ps of unrestrained molecular dynamics during which the system was allowed to evolve freely. The distance and dihedral angle restraints employed in model generation (see above) were not applied during the MD simulations.

For constant dielectric simulations, a shift-based cutoff of 14 A was employed to truncate the nonbonded interactions, while in the 6 = r simulations a switching function between 5 and 9.5 A was employed [26]. The timestep in the MD simulations was 0.2 fs with structures saved every 1 ps for subsequent analysis. To assess rigorously conformational content, saved structures were analyzed residue by residue in terms of percentage occupancy 01 the areas defined by the modified Ramachandran plot displayed in Fig. 1.

3. Results

The sequence modelled corresponds to that of the P-region of the second domain of the eel voltagegated sodium channel [3]:

ensured that P-sheet hydrogen bonds or intrahelical (i + i + 4) hvdrogen bonds were maintained. Target values for restraints were taken from statistical analyses of proteins [30,3l]. The combination of the two restraints files uniquely identifies a given configuration (Table I ). 3.2. DG / SA and SA /MD generuted ensembles

The sequence was blocked at the N-terminus by an acetyl group and at the C-terminus by a amide group to mimic the presence of peptide bonds at either end of the peptide when within the intact protein. In the native sodium channel. the P-region is believed to adopt a hairpin topology. with either end at the extracellular face of the membrane, and the centre of the P-region either at the intracellular face. or within the hilaycr. Three configurations of possible P-hairpins were generated: with a 2. 3 or 4-residue turn in the centre of the P-region (models p2, @3. and p4 respectively). A further model composed of a helixloopphelix motif with a four-residue turn was also generated ((~4). While this mode1 is not supported by the circular dichroism data, it served as a control for the model-building and MD simulation studies. The choice of turn position and length within the sequence was determined on the basis of statistical analyses of high-resolution protein crystal structures [27.3X]. Scanning the P-region sequence with a 4-n:siduc window. we identify the tetrapeptide LCGE as the most likely candidate for the p-turn as determined by two independent propensity tables [27.28]. Thus. we selected GE. LCG and LCGE as the sequences of the turns within the p2, p3 and fl4 models respectively. with 8 residue P-strands on either side of the turn sequence. It should be noted for comparison that a previous analysis of the scquence of sodium channel P-region sequences suggested the tetrapeptidc CGEW as the turn. i.e.. a I~residue shift from our definition [29]. The (~4 model had LCGE as the turn sequence. with 10 residue cw-helices on either side. Each configuration was defined by two restraints files (Table I). A dihedral angle restraint file was employed to maintain the secondary structure of a given configuration. while a distance restraints file

Forty structures for each of the four configurations were generated as described. Geometric and energetic analyses are presented in Table 2. While most of the energy terms are comparable. there are ;I few differences that can be highlighted. The increased dihedral angle restraints energy t E,.,,,,) for the p2 and p3 ensemble occurs primarily due to restraints violations at residues proximal to the turn.

The lower electrostatic energy (hence lower total energy) for the (r4 ensemble is due to the larger number of hydrogen bond restraints in this ensemble compared to the P-hairpin ensembles (12 hydrogen-bonds for a4, 8 hydrogen-bonds for p2,3,4; Table 1). The degree of variation within the ensembles is indicated by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculated over residues restrained in either o-helical or P-strand conformation (Table 2) and is demonstrated by the superposition of structures for the /34 ensemble in Fig. 2. While the three P-hairpin Oconfigurations have a similar RMSD value of 1.8 A, the (-u4 ensemble has a larger RMSD (2.5 A) reflecting the absence of restraints between the two a-helices of the helical hairpin.

The structure selected for extended MD simulations is shown for each of the four configurations in Fig. 3. Structures for MD were selected according to combined criteria: a low number of violations from the target restraints; acceptable backbone stereochemistry as assessed by the program Procheck [23]; and a low overall potential energy. Although the structures selected from the p 2, p 3 and fl4 ensembles have several violations of the dihedral angle restraints, the residues on which p-conformation was imposed (i.e., the ` core' residues) remained in the most preferred region of the Ramachandran plot, according to Procheck [32]. The structure selected

from the (~4 ensemble exhibited only a single deviation from the target dihedral angle restraints. Notable in the p2 preferred structure is the appearance of a short a-helix from residues Asp-4 to Phe-9 (i.e., corresponding approximately to SSI), which was not imposed during the structure generation demonstrating the conformational flexibility permitted to the unrestrained regions of the peptide. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed in isotropic environments using three different dielectric constants to mimic different solvent screening effects: E = 2 and 80 for hydrophobic and highly screened environments, respectively, and 6 = r (i.e., a distance-dependent dielectric constant) for solvent screening of long-range interactions without affecting shorter range electrostatic effects. In assessing the simulations, we concentrate on the degree of retention of the original structure. This we have analysed in terms of the persistence of hydrogen bonds through the simulation, and in terms of the conformational persistence of residues. The simulations are discussed below with results presented in Table 3.

3.4. E = r .simulations The simulations using E = r for /34 and a4 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. It can be seen that from these two initial configurations, there is retention of the secondary structure throughout the MD simulasecondary tion as reflected in the high-percentage structural content for the core of the P-region (Fig. 5). and the high degree of persistence of hydrogen bonds for this region (Table 3). It is interesting to observe (Fig. 5) that for p4, the C-terminal region (SS2) retains its p-conformation better than the Nterminal (SSI) region. On the contrary, for a4, the initial conformation appears more stable in SSI than in SK?, with the evolution of a longer SS 1 helix (Fig. 5B). Although for p3 and p2 the percentage secondary structure within the core remains high, the hydrogen bond persistence is considerably reduced. Indeed for fl3, all the hairpin hydrogen bonds are lost early in the simulation, the high RMSD for this simulation reflecting this, while for /32, one hydrogen bond pair persists throughout the simulation while the other six arc lost. 3.5. F = 2 simulations

A dielectric constant of 2, mimicking a hydrophobic medium, was expected to preserve local electrostatic interactions such as intrahelical hydrogen bonds or antiparallel P-strands hydrogen bonds. However, the simulations starting from p configurations did not conform to this expected pattern. Hydrogen bonds persisted only to a very small degree in the p2 and p3 simulations, and were lost completely in the first 25 ps of the /34 simulation. Such absence of hydrogen bonds means that although a high percentage of the core residues remains in the p-strand region 01 the Ramachandran plot, there is no overall P-hairpin conformation. This increased flexibility is revealed in the markedly higher RMSD values for these simulations (Table 3). For the a4 simulation, the hydrogen bonds persisted to a greater degree (44%) than with P-hairpins. but both conformations are about equally maintained throughout the simulation (Table 3) with the same tendency noted above (in the case

of .z = Y) for the SS 1 helix to be more conserved than the SS2 helix. 3.6. E = 80 simulations Simulations in this high dielectric medium yielded similar results to those obtained in E = 2. Hydrogen bond persistence was again very low for P-hairpin configurations, with no antiparallel hydrogen bonded ladder for the fi2 and p3 configurations persisting beyond the first 25 ps of the trajectory. The RMSD values of these P-hairpin simulations are again con-

siderably higher than observed for E = Y simulations (Table 3). For the a4 simulation, a similar picture emerged with loss of hydrogen bonds early in the trajectory and disappearance of an o-helical hairpin structure. For the E = 80 simulations, there is further evidence of the breakdown in secondary structure, as the percentage of core residues in the cr and p regions of the Ramachandran plot becomes equivalent except for p4 (Table 3). In the (~4 simulation, 28% of core residues from the SS2 part adopt a p-conformation, while in the /32 and p 3 options, 20-25% core residues adopt an a-conformation.

Both conformational percentages and H-bonding indices are very close for the simulations with the ` high' and ` medium' stereochemical quality initial structures. The results are noticeably different for the simulation starting from the ` low' stereochemical quality model. Indeed, the cr-helical content increases at the expense of the p-conformation (final value ca. 50%). The markedly low H-bond indEx reflects such loss of P-hairpin configuration. However, one H-bond (adjacent to the turn) persisted throughout the simulation justifying the turn assignment. The data suggest that the starting model stereochemical quality influences the simulation only if the initial model exhibits poor stereochemistry.

4. Discussion High-resolution three-dimensional structures are not yet determined for the vast majority of membrane proteins, in particular for ion channels. To aid our understanding of the conformations of such proteins, we have adopted a peptide approach to dissect out key fragments to estimate their local secondary structure and assay their functional properties [33]. It has already been shown that such fragments in isolation may adopt a conformation very similar to that within the intact protein [34], and that molecular modelling may be used to predict [24,35] structural features that can be subsequently tested by further Here, we have attempted to repreexperimentation.

sent our experimental structural data (circular dichroism and infrared) as geometric constraints for a peptide corresponding to the pore-forming region of the second domain of the electric eel voltage-gated sodium channel. After generating alternative possible models compatible with the spectroscopic data (i.e., three P-hairpins. /32, p3 and p4, and an a-helical hairpin cu4), we examined their stability by means of MD simulations. One of the main limitations of these MD simulations is that they are performed in vacua, i.e., in the absence of explicit solvent molecules. However, for a first approximation, we wished to test whether such MD simulations would reveal conformational preferences of the P-region, as the protocol was able to sample a larger conformational space than, e.g., energy minimisation. Thus, we hoped that the MD simulations might reveal whether or not models built on the basis of experimentally derived restraints were intrinsically stable. For comparison with secondary structural data derived from our previous CD studies [ 181, four models were built for P,, according to a restrained SA/MD protocol. Then, 300 ps of unrestrained MD simulations were run under three different dielectric constants. A comparable study has been described for the S4-S45 fragments from domains 11 and IV of the same channel [17]. CD results showed that the S45 moiety can undergo an (Y+ extended conformational change when increasing the medium polarity while S4 segments remain largely helical [36]. This is parallelled in independent ab initio modelling studies during which a loss of helicity for the S45 part is observed under the same conditions. In the present study, we have used the persistence of secondary structure conformation as the criterion for assessing molecular dynamics simulations. This criterion identifies simulations starting from /34 and a4 configurations and employing a distance-dependent dielectric constant as being preferred (Table 3). These simulations suggest that in isolation. the SSl region of P,, is more stable as an a-helix than SS2, while the converse is true for a p-conformation. This suggestion is further supported by analysis of E = 2 and E = 80 simulations. In low dielectric medium (where P-conformation is not retained) the SSl region of the P,, peptide retains a-helicity better than SS2, while in a high dielectric medium, the SS2 region of a4 loses cu-helicity in favour of p-confor-

mation. As regards the different turn probabilities for the P-hairpins, the Z-residue turn has a very constrained geometry, and the 3-residue turn seems disfavoured as described above. The 4-residue turn retains our preference since the H-bond near the turn persists significantly even for the simulation with the low stereochemical quality initial model (see Section 3.7). In an apolar environment ( CI= 2). the helical hairpin is preferred probably since H-bonds are all satisfied, whereas only half of the possible backbone H-bonds are formed in a P-hairpin in a monomeric state. However, many experimental points support inter-peptide association: (i) in CD experiments, increasing the peptide concentration promotes the pconformational content [ 181; and (ii) fluorescencs energy transfer experiments carried out using similar peptides reveal a high propensity for self-recognition and assembly in lipid systems [l9]. This, together with our own conductance measurements, suggest that the P-region peptide inserts into planar lipid bilaycrs and forms multimeric aggregates that fulfil the unsatisfied H-bonds of a monomeric P-hairpin. Given that experimental studies with the sodium channel P-peptides argue for tetrameric conducting aggregates [ 181 and with the help of methods for modclling transbilayer &barrels [37], the next step will he to investigats possible configurations for thcsc channel-forming aggregates. On nlore general grounds. recent studies of interactions between helices or segments in membrane proteins [38,393. validated against membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure lead us to hope that increasingly accurate models of ion channels will be formulated [40], while direct structural determinations remain somewhat elusive.
