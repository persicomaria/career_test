Abstract-The be&tine bridge-forming enzyme (BBE) has been found in 66 samples taken from differentiated plants and from cell suspension cultures. It was puritied 4%fold from Berberis beaniana cell cultures by gel-filtration, DEAE and phenyl-Sepharose chromatography, electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing The enzyme was shown to be homogeneous by gel electrophoresis (M, = 52 kD f 4). The enzyme, which requires the presence of oxygen, catalyses the conversion of the (S)-enantiomers of reticuline, protosinomenine and laudanosoline to the corresponding (S)tetrahydroprotoberberines and released stoichiometric amounts of HzOz. Within the cells the enzyme is located in a particle with the density p = 1.14 g/ml.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

keystone in the biosynthesis of a great number of isoquinoline alkaloids in the plant kingdom is reticuline. This compound is also a biogenetic precursor of the protoberberine skeleton. Reticuline is converted via scoulerine to various protoberberines as has been previously determined by precursor feeding experiments using differentiated plants [l-3]. During this conversion of the benxylisoquinoline the socalled berberine bridge is formed, i.e. the N-Me group of reticuline is converted to carbon 8 of the protoberberine molecule. Rink and Biihm [4] were the first to describe a cell-free system prepared from Macleaya microcarpa cell suspension cultures which could convert reticuline to scoulerine. The enzyme which was named the berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), was purified 7-fold for the preliminary study of its properties. In our continuing work on the enzymology of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, we have developed a new and convenient assay procedure for the BBE, and attempted to purify andcharacterixe this important enzyme.

The

Assay principle The formation of the berberine bridge involves the oxidation of the N-methyl group of reticuline and subsequent ring closure, most probably proceeding via an imminium species (Fig. 1). The loss of a hydrogen atom during this process was the basis for the development of a very sensitive assay of this enzyme using [-N-CT& labelled (S)-reticuline as a substrate. Enxymecontaining samples were analysed by first incubating them with the labelled substrate, and then by assaying the aqueous part of the incubation mixture for radioactivity. Water could be separated from the rest of the test sample for this purpose either by sublimation [S], or, more conveniently, charcoal the method by C61. Any Wtetrahydroprotoberberine oxidase (STOX) present in crude extracts could, however, subsequently act on the reaction product (S)-scoulerine to form dehydroscoulerine with the additional removal of one tritium atom

[7]. Thus, measurenients of the BBE activity could be twice as much as the real values. In order to avoid this problem, morin, a very potent inhibitor of STOX [7] has to be included in the assay in a concentration of 5 x lo- ' M or more. The BBE is not affected by morin concentrations of up to 1 mM, while the interfering STOX enzyme is totally inhibited. Using [N-CTJlabelled (S)-reticuline of high specific activity (7 Ci/mmol), the enzyme activity of BBE could be quantified down to a value of 0.05 fiat; this corresponds to a value of about 6OOOcpm released; this method is therefore one of the most sensitive assays ever developed for measuring an enzyme of a seconmetabolic pathway. Figure 2 shows the time course of a tritium removal catalysed with the

BBE from [N-CT,]-(Streticuline, which corresponds approximately to the expected release of l/3 of the radioactivity. The subsequent addition of purified STOX [7], causes the release of an additional l/3 of the originally present radioactivity into the aqueous phase.

B&m and Rink [8] have previously demonstrated the occurrence of BBE by TLC in cell-free extracts of seven differentiated plants and one cell culture [4]. In order to extend our knowledge of the taxonomic distribution of the enzyme and to find the most suitable plant material for the attempted purification and characterization of the enzyme we screened 21 differentiated plants and 67 cell suspension cultures for the occurrence of the BBE. As shown in Table 1, the highest activities of crude enzyme extracts from whole plants were detected in the families l /*-.- Papaveraceae and Fumariaceae. The enzyme was also found in a considerable number of the cell cultures .' screened. Plant species which are known not to contain protoberberine alkaloids were used as controls to test the / B i assay procedure and, as expected, did not show any tritium release from the substrate. The control species used were: Catharanthus roseus; Nicotiana tabacum; A

cultures derived from them yielded enzyme activity. Of all the cell suspension cultures tested, Berberis beaniana proved to be the most suitable with regard to its high yield of enzyme per volume of medium, its ease of cultivation, its reproducibility, and its morphological characteristics. This culture was therefore used to investigate the growth parameters and time course of enzyme formation. As shown in Fig. 3, the enzyme is present in the inoculum (day 0) in only very small amounts. The activity increases at the late log phase and peaks at day 11 of cultivation, exactly at the point when the culture enters the stationary phase. A 15fold increase in enzyme activity can be seen as compared with only a 6-fold increase in dry cell matter.

The pure enzyme showed a pH optimum at pH 8.9, as depicted in Fig. 4. The enzyme had a broad temperature optimum between 40 and 50". The activation energy for tritium release over the temperature range from 20 to 30" was determined to be 48.6 kJ/mol. The isoelectric point of the homogeneous enzyme is at pH 4.9. Identical values were obtained both with isoelectric focusing and with chromatofocusing. The molecular weight of the protein was determined by SDS gel electrophoresis to be 54 kD. By gel filtration on AcA 54 the enzyme shows a distribution coefficient which corresponds to a molecular weight of 49 kD, assuming a globular shape. We have to

Total activity of the enzyme then decreases drastically during the stationary phase. For the purification of the enzyme, cells harvested on days 10-12 were used.
Pur$cation of BBE Cell cultures of B. beaniana contain high amounts of protoberberines mainly jatrorrhizine [9]. In the early phases of this work, we recognixed that these quatemary alkaloids exert a strong inhibitory effect on the BBE. In order to remove most of these interfering cationic substances the deep yellow crude enzyme solution was treated first with carboxymethyl-Sepharose and subsequently with dextrancoated charcoal. The resulting protein solution was then fractionated using standard procedures and yielded, after isoelectric focusing, a single protein band in SDS gel electrophoresis. The enzyme so obtained, had been purified 450 times and contained 0.7 % of the originally activity present in the crude extract. The data

conclude that the true molecular weight is in the range of 52&4 kD. As judged from SDS electrophoresis, the enzyme consists of only one polypeptide chain. The enzyme is quite stable. Its catalytic activity under sterile conditions at pH 7.4 was determined to have half lives of 6 days when stored at 37"; 18 days at 25"; 150 days at 4"; 320 days at -20". The product of the enzyme-catalysed reaction using reticuline as a substrate was identified as follows: 0.1 mM of (R,S)-reticuline was incubated at pH 8.9 with 520 pkat of enzyme at 25" (total volume 1 1.). The reaction was followed by TLC of aliquots. After 4 days, exactly 50 % of the substrate had been converted; on further incubation no subsequent metabolism was observed. The mixture was extracted with chloroform and the extract gave, on TLC purification, 5.6 mg of a product which was identical to scoulerine on several TLC and HPLC systems. Its MS showed a molecular ion at m/z 327 (38%) and fragments at m/z 178, 176, 150. The `HNMR spectrum showed resonances for H-l (66.82); H-4 (66.60); H-11 and H-12 (66.71) identical to the authentic substance [lo]. The characteristic signals for coreximine (H-12, 66.56; HZ-8, 64.05) [lo] were not Acetylation (pyridine-AclO) and mass present. spectrometry of the diacetate gave identical signals when compared to authentic diacetyl scoulerine (m/z 411 (18%) 150 (100%)). [a]h3 = -279" (c 0.56; MeOH). The reaction product was quantitatively converted by the STOX enzyme, which is completely stereospecific [7], to dehydroscoulerine. By these criteria the product of the reaction catalysed by BBE is unequivocally (S)-scoulerine. The isomeric coreximine was never found to be formed by the enzyme under investigation. The stoichiometry of the reaction was investigated by following the lead given by Rink and Biihm [4] that the enzymatic reaction shows absolute oxygen requirement. Following the consump tion of oxygen it was observed that 0.94 mole were consumed for each mole of reticuline transformed. Assuming the removal of two hydrogen atoms during the formation of scoulerine, this stoichiometry could be most simply completed by the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Analysis for H202 did indeed show that for each mole of scoulerine formed, one mole of Hz02 was produced. Figure 5 demonstrates the kinetic relationship between

the reactants. Under the conditions chosen (S)-reticuline consumption (as measured by a specific radioimmunoassay) paralleled the rate of consumption of oxygen. On the product side, scoulerine and HIOz were formed stoichiometrically and simultaneously, while the release of tritium was clearly delayed. A net kinetic isotope effect of k,.JkT = 1.64 was calculated using the initial velocities measured for tritium release and for scoulerine/HrO, production. The origin of this effect is not clear; this will be investigated further. Finally, the substrate specificity of the enzyme was determined. (S)-Reticuline was up to now the established substrate for BBE. [N-CTJ-(R)Reticuline with high specific activity (3.2 Ci/mmol) was not transformed at all; neither were the N-oxides of(S)- or (R)-reticuline. Of the three possible isomers of reticuline, only (Qprotosinomenine was transformed at the same rate as reticuline to (S)-3,9dihydroxy-2,lOdimethoxytetrahydroprotoberberine, the (R)-stereoisomer again being completely inactive. No reaction was observed with orientaline or iso-orientaline. Also, (R,S)-laudanidine and laudanosine were completely inactive. Of all the other substrates tested, only laudanosoline was converted to a corresponding tetrahydroprotoberberine, albeit only at 20% of the rate of conversion of reticuline and protosinomenine. In each of these cases analysis of the reaction was performed by measuring the release of HzOz, and in positive cases as tell as in the negative case of laudanidine, the reaction was checked by HPLC. The structural formulae and relative rates of conversion of potential benzylisoquinoline substrates are given in Table 3. Lineweaver-Burk plots gave a k, value of 0.1 PM for (S)reticuline and V_ of 17 fmol/sec for 7.1 ng of the purified enzyme. One mole of enzyme catalyses the transformation of at least 0.35 mol of substrate per second. As judged from the failure to inhibit the enzyme by established SHbinding inhibitors like p-OH-mercuribenzoate, Nethyhnaleimide, iodosobenzoate and a&amide (each at 0.6 mM), obviously no -SH group is essential for the catalytic activity of BBE. However, chelating agents showed strong inhibitory effects on the enzyme. The enzyme was inhibited 50 % by: 6 PM o-phenanthroline; 0.4 mM diethyldithiocarbamate; 6 mM Nal EDTA.

50 mM concentration. The enzyme was highly resistant to inactivation by Hz02 and only at 0.7 M was a 50% reduction in catalytic activity observed. As indicated above, protoberberine alkaloids exert a strong inhibiting effect on the BBE. 50% inhibition was observed with 4pM berberine and 30pM jatrorrhixine, but also with 1 PM (S)-norreticuline, 20 PM (R)-norreticuline, 10 FM (S)-scoulerine and 200 PM (Qcoreximine. Intracellular distribution of BBE A routine check using isopycnic ultracentrifugation with a linear sucrose gradient showed that more than 90 % of the total activity of the BBE in crude preparations is confined to a nearly symmetrical band with a density of 1.14 g/ml (Fig. 6). The maximal activity found does not correspond with the following marker enzymes: cyto-

Freezing of the tissue or grinding of the tissue in buffer without an osmoticum, releases the enzyme quantitatively in a freely soluble form. Thus the enzyme is normally confined to a particle @ = 1.14) within the cell.
DISCUSSION The berberine bridge enxyme, originally discovered and named by Rink and Biihm [4], has been purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme reaction products and substrate specificity have been determined. In the presence of oxygen the enyme catalyses the transformation of (S)-reticuline and (S)-protosinomenine with the. concomitant formation of HsOs and (S)scoulerine as well as (S>3,9dihydroxy-2,1Odimethoxytetrahydroprotoberberine, respectively. The latter leads by a minor route to the protoberberine alkaloid jatrorrhixine [ll]. The only other substrate which was acted upon by the enzyme is laudanosoline, which has not been found to occur in nature. The enzyme is widely distributed, but it only occurs in benxylisoquinoline alkaloid-containing plant species and cell cultures derived therefrom. It fills an important role, channeling thecentral precursor (S)-reticuline into the protoberberine, protopine, benxophenanthridine, phthalideisoquinoline and rhoeadine pathway [3]. From a regulatory point of view it is of interest that the enzyme is locali& in a particle with the density of p = 1.14 g/ml a value identical with that of the STOX enxyme [7]. No decision can be made yet as to the mechanism by which the enzyme converts the substrate to the tetrahydroprotoberberineq either an ionic or a radical mechanism can be postulated [3].

enzyme could not be determined, the inhibition by ophenanthroline and other chelating agents strongly suggests metal ion involvement. These questions have to await the isolation of substantial amounts of BBE.
EXPERIMENTAL

Materials. Whole plant parts were obtained from the Munich botanical garden. The organs were frozen in liquid Ns, powdered, and used immediately for the enzyme assay. Cell cultures were provided by the cell culture laboratory of this department. B. beaniana was grown as previously described and frozen in liquid N2 [9]. [-N-t4CHs] and [N-CT&(R) or (S+reticuline were synthetized from the corresponding norreticuline by transfer of the radioactive methyl group of Sadenosyl-r.-methionine (Amersham) catalysed by (R,S~norreticuline N-methyltransferase [12]. Alkaloids were synthetixed according to standard procedures [e.g. 13). The identity and optical purity were checked in each case. (R)- and (S)-reticuhne N-oxides were synthesired according to literature procedures [14]. Commercially available were: (R,S)-laudanosine (Aldrich), (R,Sb laudanosoline (EGA) and (R,S~laudanidine (Merck). Enzyme actioities. The routine assay mixture contained, in a total volume of 0.25 ml: 100 mh4 glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.9); 255 pmol [-N-CT,]-reticuline (180 mCi/mmol or higher), and protein up to 0.1 mg. The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by the addition 9f 0.3 ml of a neutralized suspension of activated charcoal (4%) in distilled water. The suspension was agitated for 1 min and the charcoal was removed by centrifugation (all Eppendorf systems). The radioactivity of a 350 pl aliquot was measured by scintillation counting (in 5ml Rotisxint, Roth Karlsruhe). Protein preparations from plants or cell cultures were prepared as follows: 2-8 g (fr. wt) of deep-frozen plant material were stirred at room temp in phosphate buffer (100 mM; pH 7.4; 2 ml/g fr. wt) until a homogeneous suspension was obtained. The mixture was pressed through cheesecloth, and the filtrate centrifuged for 10 min at 2 x 10" rpm. (NH4)$G4 was added to the supernatant to 70% satn and the suspension was centrifuged. This ppt was taken up in the assay buffer, and this mixture was freed from low molecular weight material by filtration through Sephadex G 25 (1 x 13 cm). The protein-containing eluate was used as the enzyme source for subsequent experiments. For the subcellular locahxation of the enzyme, B. beaniana suspension cultures were freshly harvested, suspended in osmotic butfer (2ml/g fr. wt), and ground in a mortar. The procedure followed was adapted from ref. [ 151using osmotic buffer consisting of 500 mM sac~harose; 150 mM tricine-NaOH, pH 7.5; 10mM KCk 5 mM thio%ycohte; 1 mM MgC&; 1 mM Nas EDTA. After centrifugation for 4 hr at 9 x 10' g, fractions of 2.5 ml were collected. Enzyme purjfieation. All operations were carried out at O-4". 250 g deep-frozen cells were suspended in 300 ml 20 mM KPi pH 7.4 and extracted as above. Carboxymethyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia, 160 g) preequihbrated in the same buffer was added to the centrifugate. The suspension was shaken for 5 mitt, filtered, and then a final concn of 5% (v/v) dextrancoated charcoal was added to the filtrate. The suspension was agitated for 1 mitt and filtered. The liquid was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel cohurut (4.7 x 40 cm) which was pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was retained during elution with this buffer. It was subsequently eluted with buffered 0.3 MKCI at a rate of 1 ml/mitt. The eluate was applied to an Uhrogel AcA 54 column (5.0 x 93 cm) which was run with the pH 7.4 buffer. The enzyme appeared between 800 and 900 ml of ehtant. The fractions were pooled and adsorbed into DEAE-Sephacel (1.4 x 6 cm column). This was eluted using a linear gradient of 0.0-0.3 M KCI and the

enayme came off around 0.18 M. Fractions containing the enzyme (18&220ml) were pooled and applied to a phenylSepharose column (1 x 6.5 cm), which had previously been equilibrated with standard buffer containing 0.1 M KCI. The enzyme was eluted with EtOH-Hz0 (25:75, v/v). The enzyme appeared as a sharp peak in fractions 57-61. Each 650 pg portion of protein from the previous step was applied to disc gel electrophoresis (9% polyacrylamide) [16]. Bands were cut and eluted and those eluates containing the enzyme were pooled. Samples of this material containing 14Opg protein in 750~1 5 mM phosphate butfer (pH 7.5) with 8.5% glycerol were subjected to isoelectric focusing using cylindrical gels [`lyacrylamide 7.3 % w/v containing 2.3% (w/v) ampholine pH4-6.5 from LKB]. Electrode solns used were 0.075 M NHsS04 (anode) and 0.075 M triethanolamine (cathode). The separation time was 4 hr at 4" and 200 V. The eluate of the enzyme-containing segments (pH 5.14.8) contained the homogeneous protein as judged by discontinuous SDS gel electrophoresis [ 173. Analytical procedures. Renxylisoquinolinas and tetrahydroprotoberberines were separated by TLC (silica gel 60, Merck) developing with xylems-2-butanone-MeOH-EtsNH (50:50:6:2). HPLC was conducted with a Spectra Physics instrument on Nucleosil 7 C 18 (4 mm x 25 cm) using MeGH-0.3 % (NH4)sC03 (75 : 25) as solvent system. Flow rate 0.8 ml/mitt, detection at 283 nm. (S~Reticuline was quantified by a radioimmunoassay specitically directed towards the (St enantiomer in the 0.05-5 ng range [U. Wieczorek, unpublished]. H202 was determined according to ref. [18]. Oxygen was measured with Clark's oxygen electrode and protein as described in ref. [19]. Relative protein values were determined according to ref.
