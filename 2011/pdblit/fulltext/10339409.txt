Abstract IX-bp and IX/X-bp are heterogeneous two-chain anticoagulantproteins isolated from the venom of habu snake, Trimeresurus flavoviridis. The amino acid sequence of one (B chain) of their two chains is identical. We recently reported the cloning of cDNA encoding the B chain and that of the A chain of IX/X-bp. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of cDNA clones encoding the A chain of IX-bp. The 697-bp sequence showed a putative ORF capable of encoding a 152-amino-acidprotein containing a 23-amino-acidsignal peptide. The overallaminoacid sequenceidentitybetween the pre-Achain of IXbp and that of IX/X-bp is 84%, whereas the cDNA sequence identity of the two ORFSis 91% indicatingthat habu snake acquired the varietyof venomproteins by efficientmutationsof anonymous sites. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Lld We isolated two anticoagulantproteinsfrom the venomof habu snake (Trimeresurusflavoviridis):IX/X-bpbound to either the bloodcoagulationfactorsIX or X, whereasIX-bp bound to the coagulation factor IX alone (1, 2).

have revealed that both IX/X-bpand IX-bpare heterogeneoustwo-chainproteinsconsistingof the A chain of 129 aminoacid residuesand the B chain of 123 amino acid residues,and while 19 amino acid residues of their A chains are differentthe amino acid sequenceof the B chain is identical in these two-chainproteins (2, 3). Each chain has similarityto the sequence of the carbohydrate recognition domain of C-type lectins (CRD) such as asialogiycoprotein receptors (2, 3). From the crotalinaesnake venoms,many IX-bp- and IX/X-bp-likeproteins consisting of two heterogeneousCRD-likedomains linked by an interchain S-S bond with functional differences have been isolated. For example, from the venom of Bothrops jararaca, in additionto an anticoagulantprotein that binds to coagulationfactorsIX and X (4), three other heterogeneoustwo-chainproteins were obtained:botrocetinis a von Willebrand factor (vWF)-dependentplatelet agglutinationinducer (5), glycoprotein Ib-binding protein (CiPIb-bp), platelet aggregationinhibitor(6), and bothrojaracin,a hirudin-likeanticoagulant a (7). These observationsindicatethat the IX-bp- and IX/X-bp-likestructureis atypical motif of venomprotein. We prepared a cDNA library from the venomglandsof habu snakes, and cloned the cDNAs encoding IX/X-bp A and B chains (8). In the present study,we isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encodingthe A chain of IX-bp, and compared with the cDNAs encodingIX/X-bpA and B chains.

MATERIALSAND METHODS Cloningof IX-bp A chain cDNA. A partial IX-bp A chain cDNA fragmentfrom nt 139 to 525 (from aa 1 to 129) (see Fig. 2) was obtainedby PCR using the T.javoviridis venomgland cDNA library as templateand 18mer sense and 21-mer antisenseprimers based on the N-terminaland C-terminalamino acid sequences of the IX-bp A chain (2). Construction of the cDNA library was reported elsewhere(8). After confirmationof its identityas IX-bp A chain cDNA by sequencing,this PCR-generatedIX-bp A chain cDNA fragmentwas DIG-labeledusing a DIG DNA labeling kit (BM) and used to screen a T.$%voviridiscDNA library. Approximately4 x 105 E. coli clones were screenedunder standardhybridizationconditions. DNA sequencing. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain-terminationmethod using a Taq Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing kit and a Taq Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (AppliedBiosystems)and a nucleotidesequencer(model373A,AppliedBiosystems). Oligonucleotidesynthesis. Oligonucleotidesfor PCR and DNA sequencing were prepared with a DNA synthesizer (model381A,AppliedBiosystems).

RESULTSAND DISCUSSION cDNA cloning. Two clones encoding the IX-bp A chain were obtained from the library. The sequences of

S'-end noncoding region and ORF of these clones were the same, while they had the poly (A)+tails of different lengths. Sequencingstrategy for a longer clone and structure of the oligonucleotidesused as primers are shown in Fig. 1. Sequence analysis of these clones revealed the presence of a signal peptide of 23 amino acids (Fig. 2). Both cDNA clones consisted of the 5'-end noncoding region, open reading frame corresponding to a signal peptide and mature IX-bp A chain, stop codon, 3'-endnoncodingregion, a poly (A) signal, and a poly (A)+tail, and neither clone contained the IX-bp B chain cDNA (Fig. 2). These results indicatedthat each chain of IX-bp is encodedby the respectivegene:that is each chain of IX-bp is synthesizedseparately followed by formation of an interchain disulfide bond to give the two-chainprotein. Comparisonof amino acid and cDNAsequencesof theA and B chainsof IX-bp. The amino acid sequencesof IX/X-bpB chain and IX-bp B chain are completelyidentical(3). Previously, we obtained six cDNA clones encoding the B chain (8). DNA sequence analysesof these clonesrevealed an identicalsequenceincluding73 bp of 5' UTR and 187 bp of 3' UTR except for the poly (A)+tail. Therefore, it is unlikely that the gene for IX-bp B chain and that for IX/X-bpB chain are different. clones encodingthe IX-bp A cnaln were ODUUIICU IIUIII u,=

and 3' UTRShad 94'7i0 979oidentities,respectively,whereas the matureprotein-codingregion had 63% identity. These results suggest two possibilities. Firstly, the UTRS of these mRNAs might play important roles in the translation and/or stability of the mRNAs)and it was necessary to conserve the nucleotide sequence of these regions. Secondly, the nucleotide sequence of mature protein-codingregion might be changed by highly frequent mutations. Comparisonof amino acid and cDNAsequencesof IX-bp A chain and IXIX-bpA chain. The IX-bp pre-A chain consisted of a signal peptideregion and mature protein region shared 849Z0 amino acid sequenceidentitywith the IX/X-bp pre-A chain, and the DNA sequencesof the ORFSof IX-bp and IX/X-bp A chains cDNAs had 91% identity (Fig. 3). As shown in Table II, twenty-oneout of the 39 nt substitutionsin the ORFSwere single nt substitutionsin a codon, six substitutionsof which were synonymoussites whereas 15 substitutionswere at anonymous sites. All of 9 double substitutionsin a codon were anonymous. Namely, 24 amino acid changes were caused by 33 nt substitutionsin the ORFS. Similarresults were observedbetween IX-bp A chain ORF and B chain ORF and between IX/X-bp A chain ORF and B chain ORF (Table II). The nucleotide substitutionsin these ORFStended to cause amino acid changes. Similar phenomena were observed in crotalinae snake venom gland phospholipase Az (9) and serine proteases (10), and it was reported that Darwinian-type acceleratedevolutionis universalin plural isozymefamiliesof crotalinaesnake venom gland (10). The concept of "acceleratedevolution"is applicablenot only for snake venom gland isozyme families, but also for other general protein families such as the elafin family, the elastaseinhibitor(11). On the other hand, it was reported that in the genes encoding general isoproteins,the ratio of nucleotidesubstitutionsper anonymous site to thoseper synonymous sites is one to five (10). In the case of genesfor human and bovineprothrombins,two thirds of 197 single nt substitutionsin ORFSare synonymous(Table II). These findings suggest that habu snake formed a gene familyencodingvariousbindingproteinssuch as IX-bp, IX/Xbp and other IX/X-bp-like proteins to different ligands from a common ancestral gene by efficientsubstitutionsin anonymous sites of ORF after gene duplication. The IX/X-bpgene family appearsto be an exampleof acceleratedevolution.
