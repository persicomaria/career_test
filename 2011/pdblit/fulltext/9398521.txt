To get a general rule for the relationship between hydrophobic effect and conformational stability, ®ve Ile to Val and nine Val to Ala mutants (3SS mutants) from 3SS (C77A/C95A) human lysozyme were constructed. As known from previous studies, the 3SS protein lacking a disul®de bond between Cys77 and Cys95 is destabilized by enthalpic factors, as revealed by a decrease of about 20 kJ/mol in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (ÁG) value, as compared to the wild-type protein, which has four disul®de bonds. In this study, the stabilities and structures of the 3SS mutants were determined by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray crystal analysis, respectively, and compared with those of the mutants (4SS mutants) from the wild-type (4SS) protein published previously. The stabilities of all the 3SS mutants, except for V110A-3SS were decreased as compared with that of the 3SS protein, coinciding with the results for the 4SS mutants. The change in the denaturation Gibbs energy change (ÁÁG) values of the 3SS mutants relative to the 3SS protein at the denaturation temperature (49.2 C) of the 3SS protein at pH 2.7 were similar to those of the equivalent 4SS mutants relative to the wild-type at 64.9 C. The ÁÁG values of the 3SS mutants correlated with the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (ÁÁASAHP) for all of the hydrophobic residues when the effects of the secondary structure propensity were considered. This correlation is identical with that previously found for the 4SS mutants. The linear relation between ÁÁG and ÁÁASAHP for all of the hydrophobic residues with the same slope was found also for the mutants of T4 lysozyme already reported, indicating that this is a general relationship between changes in conformational stability and changes in ASA values of hydrophobic residues due to mutations.

Introduction
In order to ful®l its biological function, a protein folds to a particular conformation. The hydrophobic effect is one of the important stabilizing forces of the folded structures (Kauzmann, 1959). The hydrophobic effects have been extensively analyzed by studies with site-directed mutagenesis (e.g. see Yutani et al., 1987; Kellis et al., 1988; Matsumura et al., 1988; Shortle et al., 1990; Sandberg & Terwilliger, 1991). It has been revealed that hydrophobic residues in the interior

750 of a native protein contribute to the conformational stability but the contribution changes, depending on the differences in the environment surrounding the substitution residues and structural change due to the mutations. Systematic mutants of the bacteriophage T4 lysozyme (Eriksson et al., 1992, 1993; Xu et al., 1998), barnase (Buckle et al., 1993, 1996) and human lysozyme (Takano et al., 1995, 1997a,b) combined with structural analyses have helped to explain the detailed contribution to protein stability, by examining the relation between stability and structure responses to the mutations. However, a general rule of the stability changes due to the hydrophobic substitutions is still not available. Human lysozyme is a globular protein with 130 residues and four disul®de bonds (Figure 1). We have constructed systematic hydrophobic mutants of human lysozyme (Takano et al., 1995, 1997a,b) and determined the correlation between ÁÁG and the changes in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (ÁÁASAHP) by considering the effects of secondary structure propensity (Takano et al., 1997a) and water molecules in the cavity (Takano et al., 1997b). In this correlation, the coef®Ê cient of the correlation (slope 0.12 kJ/mol A2) is comparable with that of accessible surface areas of amino acid side-chains plotted against the hydroÊ phobicity of side-chains (0.10 kJ/mol A2) estimated by Chothia (1974). It is important to test empirically whether this correlation of hydrophobic effect with protein stability is common to globular proteins. We focused on a series of hydrophobic mutants from a mutant human lysozyme with a large perturbation, C77A/C95A mutant human

lysozyme (3SS) (Taniyama et al., 1988, 1992; Inaka et al., 1991; Kuroki et al., 1992). The 3SS human lysozyme lacking one disul®de bond between Cys77 and Cys95 is largely destabilized compared to the wild-type human lysozyme (4SS; Kuroki et al., 1992). The destabilization is caused by a large decrease in enthalpy (Kuroki et al., 1992), although entropy in the denatured state could be expected to be increased due to the deletion of a disul®de bond. That is, (i) this protein is perturbed at both the native and denatured states, (ii) the differences in properties between the perturbed protein and the intact (wild-type) protein have been analyzed in detail (Kuroki et al., 1992), and (iii) the experimental results of both proteins could be compared under the same conditions using the same kind of mutations. We constructed ®ve Ile to Val and nine Val to Ala mutants (3SS mutants) from the 3SS protein, analyzed their conformational stabilities using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and determined their crystal structures at high resolution. The results were compared with those of the mutants (4SS mutants) from the 4SS protein published previously (Takano et al., 1995, 1997a,b). The ®ve Ile residues are almost completely buried in the folded protein. The side-chains of Val93, 99, 100, 121 and 125 are also mostly buried in the inside of the molecule. In contrast, the side-chains of Val2, 74 and 110 are mostly exposed to solvent in the native protein. Val130 is the C-terminal residue (Figure 1 and see Table 6). Using the results obtained from DSC and X-ray analysis of the 3SS mutants, the correlation between ÁÁG and ÁÁASAHP for the 3SS and 4SS

751 curves are shown in Table 1. The data for 3SS human lysozyme agree with those reported previously (Kuroki et al., 1992). The Td values are sensitive to pH and increase linearly with pH for all the proteins measured. The heat capacity changes (ÁCp) of denaturation were obtained from the slopes of plots of ÁHcal against Td. The thermodynamic parameters for denaturation of the 3SS proteins at the denaturation temperature of the 3SS protein, 49.2 C, and at pH 2.7 were calculated as shown in Table 2. To obtain the most reliable thermodynamic parameters, 49.2 C was chosen as an intermediate temperature within the range of experimental data for all the proteins examined (Table 1). It minimizes errors that could result from too large a temperature extrapolation. The effects of the mutations, Ile to Val or Val to Ala, on the stability were different in each mutant protein, even for the same kind of substitution. The ÁÁG values for the 3SS mutants ranged from 0.3 to À7.3 kJ/mol at 49.2 C, but for the 4SS mutants,

mutants was examined, and the contribution of the hydrophobic effect to the stability of proteins is discussed. Moreover, by comparison with the correlation for the mutants of T4 lysozyme (Eriksson et al., 1992; Baldwin et al., 1996), a generality of the correlation is examined.

Results
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of 3SS and 3SS mutant human lysozymes DSC measurements were performed to investigate the thermodynamic parameters for denaturation of the 3SS and 3SS mutant lysozymes at pH values between 2.5 and 3.2. In this pH region, the denaturation of the 3SS protein is reversible (Kuroki et al., 1992). For each of the proteins considered in this study, the values of the denaturation temperature (Td), calorimetric enthalpy (ÁHcal), and van't Hoff enthalpy (ÁHvH) of denaturation obtained from an analysis of the DSC

ÁCp was obtained from the slope of ÁH against Td.

the ÁÁG values ranged from 2.2 to À6.3 kJ/mol at 64.9 C (Takano et al., 1995, 1997a; Table 3). X-ray structural analysis of 3SS and 3SS mutant human lysozymes For 3SS and 3SS mutant proteins, all the crystals belong to the space group P212121. Data collection and re®nement statistics for the 3SS and 3SS mutant human lysozymes are summarized in Ê Table 4. All structures were re®ned at 1.8 A resolution. The overall X-ray structures examined were essentially identical with that of the wild-type (4SS) structure. In some 3SS mutants, structural changes between the 3SS and 3SS mutants near the substitution residue were observed as described below. Structure of 3SS (C77A/C95A) human lysozyme The r.m.s deviation of each residue for the mainchain atoms between the 3SS and 4SS proteins is

shown in Figure 2(a). The shifts for residues near substitution residue 77 were larger than for those near residue 95. Figure 2(b) shows the increase in the B-factors for main-chain atoms around residue 77 in the 3SS structure (continuous line). This indicates that the region around residue 77 is more ¯exible than that around residue 95, because the residue 77 is in a loop on the surface of the native structure but residue 95 is in an a-helix in the interior of the molecule. In the vicinity of residues 77 and 95, the main difference observed between the 3SS and 4SS protein structures was the disappearance of sulfur atoms in the structure of the 3SS protein. These results for the 3SS structure in this study are identical with those in the previous report (Inaka et al., 1991). Overall structures of 3SS mutant human lysozymes Figure 3(b) shows the r.m.s. deviation of each residue for the main-chain atoms between I56V (Takano et al., 1995) and I56V-3SS (continuous line). It was similar to that between the 3SS and 4SS proteins (broken line). The B-factors for the main-chain atoms of I56V-3SS (continuous line in Figure 3(c)) were the same as those of the 3SS protein (broken line in Figure 3(c)). However, the structure changes around residue 77 between I56V3SS and 3SS (continuous line in Figure 3(a)) were larger than those between I56V and 4SS (broken line in Figure 3(a)), due to the ¯exibility of the region in the 3SS proteins. The results for the other 3SS mutant proteins were similar. Structures in the vicinity of the mutation site in 3SS mutant human lysozymes For V93A, V100A, V125A and V130A, the residues around the mutation site have shifted toward the created cavity (Takano et al., 1997a), and movements of the residues around the

mutation site in V93A-3SS, V100A-3SS, V125A3SS and V130A-3SS were observed. For example, in V93A-3SS and V93A, the side-chains of Leu15 and Met17 facing residue 93 shifted toward the created cavity. In contrast, V100A-3SS underwent a shift of Ala100 toward the cavity, as did V100A (Takano et al., 1997a). Except for the substitution of Ile59 to Val, the structural changes around the mutation site were similar for each 3SS and 4SS mutant. The structures in the vicinity of residue 59 in I59V and 4SS (Takano et al., 1995), and I59V-3SS and 3SS are shown in Figure 4(a) and (b), respectively. In I59V a new water molecule was observed in the created cavity and the side-chain conformation of Val59 was different from that of Ile59 (Takano et al., 1995; Figure 4(a)), but I59V-3SS did not have any solvent molecules in the cavity and no side-chain conformational change (Figure 4(b)). The different structural changes in the vicinity of residue 59 in I59V-3SS and I59V may be caused by the deletion of the disul®de bond (Cys77-95) that is located near residue 59.

Discussion
Role of a disulfide bond between Cys77 and Cys95 in the stability and structure of human lysozyme The destabilization of the 3SS (C77A/C95A) human lysozyme compared to the 4SS (wildtype) protein is caused by a decrease in ÁH, which must be related to the increased ¯exibility of the native state. This is indicated both by an increase in the crystallographic B-factors and by an increase in entropy in binding the N-acetylglucosamine trimer observed by isothermal titration calorimetry (Kuroki et al., 1992). In this study, we constructed 14 hydrophobic mutants from the 3SS protein, and determined their thermodynamic parameters of denaturation using differential scanning calorimetry and determined their struc-

tures by X-ray analysis. By examining each difference in stability and structure between the equivalent mutants from 3SS and 4SS previously reported (Takano et al., 1995, 1997a), the effect of the cross-linking on the stability of human lysozyme could be evaluated. Table 5 lists the differences in Gibbs energy change, enthalpy change and entropy change of the 3SS proteins relative to the equivalent 4SS proteins at 57.0 C. Because the measured denaturation temperatures of the 3SS and 4SS proteins were quite different, this temperature (57.0 C) was chosen as a midpoint between them in order to minimize extrapolation errors. In all cases, the 3SS

proteins were destabilized by about 20 kJ/mol compared with the equivalent 4SS proteins. These values were similar to the value, 20.5 kJ/mol, of decrease in ÁG due to the increase in entropy in the denatured state due to the removal of a disul®de bond between Cys77 and Cys95 estimated by Kuroki et al. (1992). The destabilization of all 3SS proteins, however, is due mainly to decreases in ÁH, as shown in Table 5. From the structural analysis, all 3SS proteins had large B-factors around residue 77 (Figures 2(b) and 3(c)). These results show that the disul®de bond between Cys77 and Cys95 in human lysozyme has an important role in

tightly maintaining the tertiary structure (Kuroki et al., 1992).

Effect of the hydrophobic mutations on the stability of the 3SS and 4SS human lysozymes The stabilities of all of the 3SS hydrophobic mutants were decreased compared with the 3SS protein, except for V110A-3SS (Table 2), in agreement with the results for the 4SS proteins (Table 3; Takano et al., 1995, 1997a). Moreover, the order of the stability in the 3SS mutants was similar to that in the 4SS mutants. Figure 5(a) shows the plot of ÁTd values for the 3SS mutants against those for the equivalent 4SS mutants at pH 2.7. The slope of the relation between them in this Figure is greater than 1.0, showing a greater destabilization in the double mutations. However, in the plot of ÁÁG for the 3SS mutants at 49.2 C against those of the corresponding 4SS mutants at 64.9 C (Figure 5(b)), the data points are near the diagonal line, indicating the additivity of the stability changes due to double mutations. The different slopes in Figure 5(a) and (b) are the result of the different temperature-dependencies of ÁG for the 3SS and 4SS proteins, as shown in Figure 6(a). Figure 6(b) displays the temperature-dependencies of ÁG for 4SS, I56V, 3SS and I56V-3SS near their denaturation temperatures at pH 2.7. The temperature at ÁG  0 is the denaturation temperature. The values of ÁÁG were similar for the 3SS and 4SS proteins (represented in red), but the decrease in the Td value for 3SS proteins was bigger than that for 4SS proteins (represented in blue) as illustrated in Figure 6(b). These results show that changes in Td values for mutant proteins do not correspond directly to the ÁÁG values.

Contribution of hydrophobic effect to the stability of human lysozyme From a series of the hydrophobic mutants (4SS mutants) of wild-type (4SS) human lysozyme, a linear correlation between ÁÁG and ÁÁASAHP (differences in hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation) for the hydrophobic mutants was observed by taking into account effects of the secondary structural propensity (Takano et al., 1997a) and water molecules in the cavity (Takano et al., 1997b). ÁÁASAHP can be calculated as follows:

The black continuous line shows the linear regression of the type I mutants, except for V93A-3SS. The mutants of type II are represented by blue circles. The red continuous line shows the linear regression of type III mutants. The ASA values were calculated using the procedure of Connolly (1993) with a probe size of Ê 1.4 A.

Here, ASAextended is calculated using the actual polypeptide with an extended conformation (Oobatake & Ooi, 1993). In this correlation, the mutants are divided into three types, according to the type of secondary structure where the mutation is located (Chou & Fasman, 1978). Type I is for the mutations of Val to Ala in a-helices (represented by black in Figure 7(b)); that is, mutations for which the secondary structural propensity would be expected to increase the stability of the protein. Type II is for the mutations of Ile/Val to Ala/Gly in b-sheets (blue); that is, mutations for which the secondary structural propensity would be expected to decrease the stability of the protein. Type III includes the mutations in turns/loops and the mutations of Ile to Val in b-sheets (represented by

red in Figure 7(a)), which are insensitive to the secondary structural propensity. In the mutations for type III of the 4SS mutants (red ®lled squares in Figure 7(a)), there is a good correlation, yielding equation (2) (Takano et al., 1997b): # ÁÁG ktamol  0X12Æ0X01 ÁÁASAr e  À 0X87Æ0X80 orreltion oeffiient of HXWR for IR points 2 We examined the correlation between ÁÁG and ÁÁASAHP for the 3SS mutants, represented as open symbols in Figure 7. There was a good correspondence between correlations for the 3SS and 4SS mutants, except for one 3SS mutant, V93A-3SS. In the mutations for type III, the correlation includ2

The value of the slope in this correlation, 0.12 kJ/ Ê mol A2, is comparable with that of accessible surface areas of amino acid side-chains plotted Ê against hydrophobicity, 0.10 kJ/mol A2, estimated by Chothia (1974). In the case of the mutation of type I, Val to Ala in a-helices (represented by black in Figure 7(b)), the stability was about 3 kJ/mol higher than that expected from the value of ÁÁASAHP using equation (3). This stabilization effect of the mutations of Val to Ala on a-helix is similar to the estimations of helix propensities for barnase, 3.7 kJ/mol (Horovitz et al., 1992), and RNase T1 peptide and protein, 2.7 and 2.8 kJ/mol, respectively (Myers et al., 1997a,b). V93A-3SS of human lysozyme, however, did not have the increment in stabilization due to helix propensity (Figure 7(b)). The amino acid sequences of the wild-type (4SS), V93A, 3SS and V93A-3SS around residue 93 are shown in Figure 8. The sequences of 3SS and V93A-3SS are similar to those of alanine-based peptides used in helix propensity experiments (Rohl et al., 1996; Park et al., 1993). Myers et al., (1997a,b) have reported that the local sequence causes solvation differences, leading to differences in the measured propensities. In the case of V93A-3SS, the peptide groups around residue 93 might be more exposed to solvent in the denatured state, as compared with those of 4SS proteins. Since residue 93 is buried in the native state, the increase of ASA value in the denatured state may cause a destabilization. Any other factors contributing to protein stability, such as side-chain entropy and strain, were not detected in the correlation (Figure 7). The difference in side-chain entropy change between Ile 3 Val and Val 3 Ala substitutions might be smaller than the experimental errors. The effect of strain was little in the proteins considered in this study because of the cavity-creating mutation. If a small to large substitution, such as Val to Ile, was examined, it would be detected in the correlation. The values of ÁÁG for the 3SS and 4SS mutants

were compared at 49.2 and 64.9 C (about 322 and 338 K), respectively, to obtain the most reliable thermodynamic parameters. The free energy for transfer of hydrocarbon from liquid hydrocarbon to water (the hydrophobic effect) increases with temperature (Hermann, 1972; Reynolds et al., 1974), but the increase is small. For the mean values (ÁGtr) of toluene, ethylbenzene, cyclohexane, pentane and hexane, the difference in ÁGtr even at 25 and 100 C (298 and 373 K) is only 10% of their values, which is within the error of our estimation (equations (2) and (3)). Comparison with T4 lysozyme mutants The stabilities and structures of some cavitycreating mutants of T4 lysozyme (Eriksson et al., 1992, 1993; Baldwin et al., 1996) have been reported. In order to examine whether the correlation between ÁÁG and ÁÁASAHP obtained from the 3SS and 4SS human lysozymes is common to globular proteins, we calculated ÁÁASAHP of all of the hydrophobic residues for the mutants of T4 lysozyme using the crystal structures (L46A, PDB code 1L67; L99A, 1L90; L121A, 200L; L133A, 1L69; F153A, 1L85; L99A/F153A, 1L89) and the wildtype structure (1L63) (Eriksson et al., 1992; Baldwin et al., 1996), which crystals belong to same space group, P3221.

That is, the changes in hydrophobic surface area of total hydrophobic residues are correlated with changes in protein stability. It could be concluded that changes in ASA values of hydrophobic residues due to mutations of globular proteins correspond to changes in conformational Ê stability of 0.12 kJ/mol A2. The reliable parameters of energetics for the factors stabilizing protein structures are also useful to be determine which conformations are optimal for an amino acid sequence.

This correlation coef®cient was better than that (0.92) obtained by using ÁÁASAHP values at only substituted residues (not shown) and the same as the case of human lysozyme (in Figure 6(c) and (d) of Takano et al., 1997a). In Figure 9, although the values of ÁÁG of T4 lysozyme mutants were slightly lower than those of human lysozyme mutants, the slope was a good agreement with that of human lysozymes.

Materials and Methods
Mutant proteins Mutagenesis, expression and puri®cation of the mutant human lysozymes were performed as described (Takano et al., 1995). The secretion of the 3SS human lysozyme was increased to about ®vefold that of the wild-type in the yeast secretion system at 30 C, as described (Taniyama et al., 1988). I23V-3SS, V74A-3SS and V110A-3SS were also secreted effectively at 30 C. For the other 3SS mutants, ef®cient secretions were observed at lower temperature (20 to 25 C), approximately corresponding to their stabilities. Then, we cultured the yeast at 30 C for 3SS, I23V-3SS, V74A-3SS and V110A-3SS, at 25 C for I59V-3SS, I89V-3SS, V93A-3SS, V99A-3SS, V100A-3SS and V130A-3SS, at 22 C for I56V3SS and I106V-3SS, and at 20 C for V2A-3SS, V121A-3SS and V125A-3SS. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using E1%  25.65 at 280 nm 1 cm (Parry et al., 1969). All chemicals were reagent grade. DSC measurements Calorimetric measurements and data analyses were carried out as described (Takano et al., 1995). In brief, a DASM4 adiabatic microcalorimeter equipped with an NEC personal computer was used. The scan-rate was 1.0 K/minute. The sample solutions were prepared by

Conclusion
Eriksson et al. (1992) have found that the decrease in the stability of the mutant T4 lysozymes substituted in the core, Leu 3 Ala, Phe 3 Ala and Leu 3 Ala/Phe 3 Ala, depends on the change in the size of the cavity. For Ile 3 Ala mutations in the core of barnase, there is also an approximately linear relation between them (Buckle et al., 1996). This relation seemed to be a successful way to reconcile hydrophobic effect to stability changes of mutant proteins. However, for the mutations expected to create small cavities such as Ile 3 Val and Val 3 Ala, and substituted on or near the surface, the correlation between ÁÁG and cavity volume has not been seen in human lysozyme (Takano et al., 1997a) or barnase (Buckle et al., 1993). It could be expected to reconcile a number of con¯icting reports concerning the strength of the hydrophobic effect on protein stability. In this study, there was a good correlation between ÁÁG and ÁÁASAHP of all of the hydrophobic residues for mutant proteins of the 3SS and

where the ÁCp values are assumed to be independent of temperature (Privalov & Khechinashvili, 1974). X-ray crystallography The 3SS and 3SS mutant human lysozymes were crystallized, diffraction data collected, and the structures re®ned as described (Takano et al., 1995, 1997a). In short, the crystals (>0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.3 mm) grew in 1.5 to 2.5 M NaCl, 0.02 M sodium acetate (pH 4.5) at 10 C. The diffraction data were collected at 10 C by the oscillation method on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIC imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode X-ray generator (CuKa radiation, 40 kV 200 mA), or on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV imaging plate mounted on a Rigaku RU300 rotating anode X-ray generator (CuKa radiation, 30 kV 100 mA). All re®nements were performed by the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) using the coordinates of the wild-type structure (Takano et al., 1995) for the 3SS structure and our 3SS model for the 3SS mutant proteins. The coordinates of the mutant human lysozymes, 3SS, I106V-3SS, I23V-3SS, I56V-3SS, I59V-3SS, I89V-3SS, V100A-3SS, V110A-3SS, V121A-3SS, V125A-3SS, V130A3SS, V2A-3SS, V74A-3SS, V93A-3SS and V99A-3SS have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, accession nos 2BQA to 2BQO. Calculation of ASA The ASA values were calculated by the procedure of Connolly (1993), Molecular Surface Package version 2.8, Ê with a probe radius 1.4 A. The van der Waals radii of the atom groups used were 1.8, 1.85, 1.9, 1.95, 1.8, 1.9, Ê 1.9, 1.6, 1.7, 1.65, 1.7 and 1.75 A for C, CH, CH2, CH3, C (aromatic), CH (aromatic), S, O, OH, NH, NH2 and NH3, respectively. Water molecules in the folded structure were removed and the cavity surface was included for calculation of ÁASA. We considered the side-chains of all hydrophobic residues in each whole structure for calculation of ÁASAHP. The ASA values of 3SS human lysozymes obtained are shown in Table 6. In order to evaluate experimental errors of the ASA values, we have measured ÁÁASAHP of all hydrophobic residues for structures of the same mutant protein determined from Ê the different crystals, which are À22.1 and À19.1 A2 for I59V and I59V2 (Takano et al., 1995), respectively.
