Indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) catalyzes the irreversible ring closure of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate (CdRP), through decarboxylation and dehydration steps, releasing indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP), the fourth step in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. This pathway is essential for Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence. Here we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and kinetic characterization of IGPS from M. tuberculosis. To perform kinetic studies, CdRP was chemically synthesized, purified, and spectroscopically and spectrometrically characterized. CdRP fluorescence was pH-dependent, probably owing to excited-state intramolecular proton transfer. The activation energy was calculated, and solvent isotope effects and proton inventory studies were performed. pH-rate profiles were carried out to probe for acid/base catalysis, showing that a deprotonated residue is necessary for CdRP binding and conversion to IGP. A model to describe a steady-state kinetic sequence for MtIGPScatalized chemical reaction is proposed. ” 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Tuberculosis (TB)1 is major public health concern, with nine million new cases and two million deaths per year (http://tballiance.org). The first-line treatment regimen for active TB prescribed today is the same since the 1980s [1], it is complex and has very low patient adherence due to the severe side effects. The causative agent of TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an easily transmitted airborne pathogen that infects primarily alveolar macrophages, beginning an infection in the lungs [2]. The emergence of multi and extensive drug resistant strains (MDR-TB, XDR-TB) and the lengthy treatment have led to efforts in identifying new targets for TB drug development. Smith and co-workers identified knockouts in the leucine, proline, and tryptophan biosynthetic pathways [3] that are unable to replicate in cul-

tured murine macrophages and show attenuation in their ability to infect mice, indicating that these amino acids are unavailable or insufficient inside the macrophage. The most marked attenuation of virulence occurred in the tryptophan auxotrophic strain, which is essentially avirulent, even in immunodeficient mice. Additionally, tryptophan is not synthesized by mammals, making enzymes from the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway viable targets for the development of new anti-TB drugs. Even thought this is a very attractive pathway for drug design and virulence understanding, very few works were conducted concerning the TB enzymes [4≠8]. The enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS) catalyzes the fourth step towards tryptophan biosynthesis, the irreversible ring closure of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate (CdRP), through decarboxylation and dehydration steps, generating indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP), which contains the indolic ring of tryptophan (Fig. 1) [9]. The mechanistic studies data available for this catalyzed reaction comprise the crystallographic structures of the IGPS from Sulfolobus solfataricus, Thermotoga maritima, and Escherichia coli, along with pre-steadystate studies carried out with the E. coli enzyme [10≠15]. Recently, a novel inhibitor targeting this TB enzyme has been proposed and the structure of MtIGPS was modeled [7]. We have recently reported electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) data showing that two intermediates are part of M. tuberculosis IGPS chemical mechanism [8]. However, a steady-state kinetic charac-

terization of this enzymatic reaction is absent in all organisms studied until the present date. In addition, there is a need for both a more thorough characterization of the substrate of IGPS-catalyzed chemical reaction, CdRP, and its behavior in solution. Here, we describe cloning, expression, and purification of trpCencoded MtIGPS. In addition, we describe a modified protocol for the chemical synthesis and purification of CdRP, and its characterization by ESI-MS, IR, 1H NMR, UV≠vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The MtIGPS-catalyzed reaction was characterized in steadystate conditions by initial velocity experiments, pH-rate profiles, temperature effects, solvent kinetic isotope effects, and proton inventory. A kinetic sequence for this reaction is proposed. It is hoped that the data presented here will contribute to improving our understanding on the mode of action of this attractive target for new anti-TB drug development. Materials and methods Materials All chemicals were of analytical or reagent grade and were used without further purification. Deuterium oxide (99.9 atom% D) was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Pfu DNA Polymerase was from Stratagene, and restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Invitrogen. Cloning, expression, and purification of MtIGPS The forward primer sequence for amplification of the trpC coding region was 50 -CACATATGAGTCCGGCAACCGTGCTCGACTC-30 , having an NdeI restriction site (bold) at the N-terminal end. The reverse primer sequence was 50 -TGGATCCTCAGCGAGCCGGTTTC GGACAG-30 , which introduced a BamHI restriction site (bold) at the C-terminal end. All PCR reactions were carried out using pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), using conditions recommended by the manufacturer, and were supplemented by the addition of 10% (v/v) DMSO. The resultant PCR product, corresponding to 819 bp, was ligated into the pCR“-Blunt (Invitrogen) vector, and transformed into E. coli DH10B. The recombinant plasmid purified from these cells was cleaved with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and the resulting fragment subcloned into the pET-23a(+) vector (Novagen) previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. The plasmid was then transformed by electroporation into E. coli BL21(DE3) STAR host cells (Novagen). Cells were grown in 4YT containing 50 lg mL¿1 carbenicillin, at 37 ∞C and after the OD600 reached 0.4≠0.6, cells were allowed to grow for additional 9 h and harvested by centrifugation at 20,800g for 30 min. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 ∞C. Cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.3 containing 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM DTT (buffer A), incubated with 0.2 mg mL¿1 lysozyme, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 48,000g for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was incubated with 20% (v/v) of streptomycin sulphate for 30 min and centrifuged at 48,000g for 30 min. After dialysis against buffer A, a buffer containing 50 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.3, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM

EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and 2 M (NH4)2SO4 (buffer B) was used to bring the (NH4)2SO4 concentration to 1 M, required for the first chromatographic purification step. The resulting preparation was loaded on a Phenyl Sepharose High Sub FF column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with 50 mM Tris≠HCl pH 7.3 containing 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, and 1 M of (NH4)2SO4 (buffer C). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C, and the adsorbed material was removed with a linear gradient of 0≠100% of buffer A. The fractions containing MtIGPS were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration membrane [molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 10,000 Da], and loaded on a Sephacryl S-100 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The fractions containing MtIGPS were pooled and precipitated with buffer B (50% v/v). The pellet (homogeneous MtIGPS) was removed by centrifugation at 48,000g for 30 min and resuspended in buffer A. To remove any residual traces of (NH4)2SO4, homogeneous MtIGPS was dialyzed against buffer A prior to storage at ¿20 ∞C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford et al. [16] using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin as standard. Oligomeric state determination The molecular mass of purified MtIGPS was estimated by gel-filtration chromatography employing a Superdex 200 HR column (1.0 cm ¬ 30 cm) (GE Healthcare). All runs were at 0.4 mL min¿1 in buffer A, and the eluate was monitored at 215, 254, and 280 nm. Molecular mass standards (GE Healthcare) were used for a calibration curve [ribonuclease A (13,700 Da) from bovine pancreas, chymotrypsinogen (25,000 Da) from bovine pancreas, ovalbumin (43,000 Da) from hen egg, albumin (67,000 Da) from bovine serum, aldolase (158,000 Da) from rabbit muscle, catalase (232,000 Da) from bovine liver, and ferritin (440,000 Da) from equine spleen]. Blue Dextran 2000 was used to calculate the void volume (V0). Chemical synthesis, purification, spectrometric, and spectrophotometric characterization of CdRP Modifications to previously reported chemical synthesis protocols [17≠20] were made, and the protocol employed for CdRP synthesis is as follows: 2.11 mmol of anthranilic acid (AA) (Sigma) were dissolved in 264 lL isopropanol (Merck) and mixed with 1.06 mmol of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) (Acros Organics) dissolved in 1.32 mL of water plus 2.64 mL of isopropanol. The reaction mixture was kept in the dark, at room temperature overnight. Reaction was then cooled (4 ∞C) for 10 min, after which two layers were formed. The aqueous phase, containing unreacted AA and R5P, was removed, and the remnant dark yellow oil washed with isopropanol and ethyl acetate. After the addition of 4 mmol of barium acetate (from a 2 M solution), CdRP precipitated as a barium salt, being isolated by centrifugation. This precipitate was washed with water, isopropanol and ethyl acetate. After desiccation, CdRP was kept at ¿20 ∞C, protected from light. The stability of the compound was estimated by UV≠vis spectra measured at different times after

the solubilization of CdRP in water pH 4.8 [20], observing the maximum absorption peaks of CdRP (350 and 254 nm) as compared with the absorption peaks of AA (maxima at 323 and 240 nm). For these measurements, CdRP was kept on ice up to 4 h, and spectra were evaluated at 30-min intervals. Owing to CdRP barium salt low solubility in D2O, a solution of Na2SO4 was added to exchange the CdRP counterion from barium to sodium, which renders the compound a higher solubility in D2O. 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Varian Inova 300 MHz. Infrared spectrum (KBr) was registered on a Bomem B-102 spectrometer. Electrospray mass and tandem mass spectra were recorded on a Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Micromass) with a scanning quadrupole (Q), an hexapole collision-cell and a high-resolution orthogonal time of flight (o-TOF) analyzer. Spectrofluorometric titration using water at different pH (0.5 pH units of difference between each pH, from 1.0 to 7.5) employed excitation wavelength of 350 nm and a slit of 1.5 nm. The emission spectra were recorded from 380 to 600 nm, with slits for excitation and emission of 3 nm. Enzymatic assay for MtIGPS Assays were performed under initial rate conditions at 25 ∞C and 100 mM PIPES pH(D) 7.5, unless stated otherwise, and measurements were at least in triplicate. The reaction was started with the addition of 36 nmol of MtIGPS, and the increase in absorbance due to IGP formation was measured at 278 nm, at 25∞ for 1 min. A molar extinction coefficient value of 5500 M¿1 cm¿1 was used for IGP [20]. Initial velocity For KM and kcat determination, initial rate measurements were carried out with CdRP concentrations ranging from 10 to 400 lM. Temperature effects To assess the activation energy of the reaction, initial velocities were measured in the presence of varying concentrations of CdRP, in the temperature range of 15≠35 ∞C. MtIGPS was incubated for several minutes in all the temperatures tested and assayed under standard conditions to ensure enzyme stability under all conditions. pH-rate profiles To determine the pH-dependence of the kinetic parameters, we measured initial velocities at varying concentrations of CdRP at different pH values employing a mixed buffer system [21] with 100 mM citrate and 100 mM Hepes with pH values in the range 4.5≠8.0. Each buffer was adjusted to the desired pH with either NaOH or HCl. The stability of the enzyme at different pH values was previously determined, by dialyzing the enzyme against a buffer in the desired pH and performing the standard reaction assay. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory Solvent kinetic isotope effects were determined by measuring initial velocities with varying CdRP concentrations in either H2O or 87 atom% D2O. Solvent kinetic isotope effects were performed at pH(D) 8.0 because of the pH plateau found in the pH-rate profiles, preventing the occurrence of any variations in velocity due to pH fluctuations. To determine the number of protons responsible for the observed solvent kinetic isotope effect, we conducted proton inventory studies with 0, 20, 40, 60, and 87 atom% D2O.

Data analysis All data were fitted to the appropriate equations using the nonlinear regression function of SigmaPlot 2000 (SPSS, Inc.). For the oligomeric state determination, the Kav value was calculated for each protein using Eq. (1)

Results and discussion Cloning, expression, purification, and biophysical characterization of MtIGPS A fragment of the expected length for the trpC gene was amplified and successfully cloned into pET-23a(+). Sequencing of the coding region of trpC proved the identity of the cloned fragment and that no mutations were introduced by the amplification steps. MtIGPS was expressed in BL21(DE3) STAR, after 9 h of growth at 37 ∞C without IPTG induction. Homogeneous MtIGPS was obtained in three purification steps, yielding 5 mg of protein from 25 g of cell paste. The MtIGPS obtained here lacks a His-tag, distinguishing it from the one previously reported [6]. N-terminal sequencing confirmed the identity of purified MtIGPS, showing that the initial methionine was not removed. A value of approximately 30,000 Da was estimated by gel-filtration, thereby showing that MtIGPS is a monomer in solution, as all other monofunctional IGPS characterized up to date [10≠12]. Chemical synthesis, purification, spectrometric and spectroscopic properties of CdRP The chemical synthesis yielded 76% CdRP, the best reported so far. To improve CdRP yield, we focused on solving the instability of CdRP and the incomplete reaction of R5P. To achieve this goal,

AA was used in excess, since the limiting reagent is R5P. Also, only the amount of water needed to solubilize R5P in the reaction mixture was utilized, since water was a too reactive medium for CdRP prior to the formation of its barium salt. Instead of ethanol [20], isopropanol was used to solubilize AA. As described by Doy [19], the stability of CdRP is increased when a CdRP barium salt is formed. The formation of the barium salt is also the most effective form of purifying CdRP, since AA and R5P do not precipitate in the presence of barium acetate, and the longer the compound remains in aqueous solution the more it hydrolyzes generating contaminants lowering CdRP yield. Washings of CdRP barium salt with water, isopropanol, and ethyl acetate were employed to remove remaining contaminants. When stored at ¿20 ∞C, in the dark, CdRP showed no decomposition for at least 1 year, attesting the stability of the barium salt. In addition, UV≠vis scannings showed no decomposition up to 3 h of CdRP solubilized in water at pH 4.8, demonstrating that it could be used in experiments within this time frame. Hommel et al. [23] suggested that there exist two CdRP tautomers in solution, an enol, and a more stable keto form, the latter being the substrate for the IGPS reaction. According to these authors, the phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase (PRAI) reaction product was the enol form, which had to undergo a non-catalyzed tautomerization that could limit the overall flow of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. This assumption was used to propose a kinetic sequence for the E. coli PRAI. However, by analyzing the structure of the enol tautomer, one could hypothesize that the electronic delocalization among the C≠C double bond, the lone electron pair on the nitrogen, and the benzoic ring might account for an increased stability as compared with the keto tautomer (Supplementary material, Fig. S1), which has only the benzoic ring under electronic delocalization (Fig. 2). To test the validity of this hypothesis we decided to further characterize CdRP. ESI-MS spectra collected at pH 5 (HCl solution) showed that [CdRP¡H]+ had a molecular mass of 350.0796, in agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 349.0563 for CdRP, with a characteristic fragmentation pattern (m/z of 234, 216, 198, 172, 150, 132). Solid state IR spectrum showed a large band at 3412 cm¿1, owing to hydroxyl groups present in the molecule, and a very weak band at 1714 cm¿1, indicating that the more abundant tautomeric form in solid state is the enol rather than the keto (Supplementary material, Fig. S2A). This finding was corroborated by the 1H NMR spectrum, which showed higher values of integration to signs related to enol form (Supplementary material, Fig. S2B). Hence, the enol tautomer is the most representative isomeric form of CdRP in solution under the tested conditions (D2O). The PRAI kinetic sequence [23] also proposed that the enol and keto species had different fluorescence properties, the enol being fluorescent and the keto being non-fluorescent. To expand our knowledge about CdRP behavior in solution, spectrofluorometric experiments were carried out. Scannings of CdRP in water at different pH values (1.0≠8.0) demonstrate that CdRP exhibits a pHdependent fluorescence change (Fig. 3). Not only the intensity of fluorescence varied, but also its maximum wavelength emission showed a small hypsochromic shift. CdRP displayed an increasing

fluorescence intensity from pH 1.0 to 2.5 with kmax = 434 (Fig. 3A), and reached a plateau from pH 2.5 to 3.5. At pH values larger than 4.0 the fluorescence intensity decreased with a hypsochromic shift, with kmax = 422 nm (Fig. 3B). Suspecting that this behavior of CdRP could be explained by a change in intramolecular hydrogen bonding among the carboxyl group and the hydrogen of the secondary amine, we investigated the behavior of the AA moiety of CdRP, conducting the same spectrofluorometric experiment with AA. According to these experiments, AA presented an increase in fluorescence emission from pH 1.0 to 5.0, at which the fluorescence signal reached a plateau (data not shown). Southern et al. [24] demonstrated that AA exhibits excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT), which could account for the change in fluorescence emission. Molecules that have acidic and basic groups in close proximity (usually five and six members) and with a suitable geometry may undergo ESIPT from the acidic moiety to the basic one as a result of modifications on the acidity/basicity properties of these groups in excited states [25≠26]. It is thus tempting to suggest that the pH-dependent fluorescence change of CdRP is due to the ESIPT in its AA moiety. Fig. 4 proposes a mechanism for CdRP ESIPT. In more acidic pH (1.0≠3.5), E0 (fundamental state) is excited to E1 (excited state 1), which undergoes ESIPT generating E2 (excited state 2), emitting fluorescence, and returning to E0, which tautomerizes to generate the ESIPT-sensitive molecule. In E1, the acidic character of nitrogen and the basic character of carboxyl increase, facilitating the proton transfer that characterizes ESIPT process. In more basic pH (>3.5), protons are donated to the medium, leading to E0* (a new ground state), and abolishing ESIPT. The primary amine on the ortho position of AA, on the other hand, does not donate its protons to the medium under the pH range analyzed, so the ESIPT persists. Indeed, it is known that the hydrogen of the secondary amine of CdRP displays an acidic character higher than the primary amine of AA. The data presented here show that a different hypothesis is needed to explain the E. coli PRAI kinetic sequence [23], since the enol is the most stable tautomer in solution and CdRP shows a pH-dependent fluorescence change which is not necessarily reporting on enol to keto form transition. Kinetic parameters Fitting initial velocity data to Eq. (2) yielded a value of KM = 55 ± 9 lM, approximately 10-fold lower than the recently reported value for this enzyme [6]. This significant difference in the KM value can be attributed to the fact that, in the previous study, CdRP was not purified prior to enzymatic assays, and the preparation may have been contaminated with enzyme inhibitors. Those could be either unreacted substrates from the chemical synthesis or hydrolysis products of CdRP, resulting in a larger apparent KM value for MtIGPS. E. coli IGPS (EcIGPS), a bifunctional enzyme, has a KM = 1.2 lM [20], while Sulfolobus solfataricus IGPS (SsIGPS), which is a monofunctional enzyme, has an even lower KM value of 0.05 lM [27], making it difficult to draw a correlation between the range of KM values and the number of enzymatic activities present in the protein.

Fig. 4. Proposed ESIPT mechanism for CdRP. The enol tautomer is depicted here to illustrate that it is more abundant in solution.

The kcat value measured for MtIGPS was 0.16 ± 0.01 s¿1, which at similar temperatures is lower in comparison to EcIGPS (3.6 s¿1) [28], and SsIGPS (0.98 s¿1 at 60 ∞C, the SsIGPS optimum temperature; 0.03 s¿1 at 37 ∞C) [27]. In addition, the MtIGPS kcat/ KM value of 2.9 ¬ 103 M¿1 s¿1 is significantly smaller than those and SsIGPS enzymes for EcIGPS (3.0 ¬ 106 M¿1 s¿1) 6 ¿1 ¿1 (19.6 ¬ 10 M s at 60 ∞C and 6.0 ¬ 106 M¿1 s¿1 at 37 ∞C).

Temperature effects The temperature dependence of kcat was evaluated, and fitting data to Eq. (3) yielded an activation energy value of 8.4 kcal mol¿1. Also, the linearity of the Arrhenius plot demonstrated that there was no change in the rate-limiting step in the temperature range employed (15≠35 ∞C) (Fig. 5).

pH-rate profiles To probe for the role of general acid/base catalysis in the MtIGPS catalyzed reaction, we investigated the pH-dependence of kcat and kcat/KM in the pH range of 5.5≠8.5. Both pH-dependent parameters displayed a similar profile, with a decrease at the acidic limb (Fig. 6). Fitting the data to Eq. (4) yielded an apparent pKa of 6.0 ± 0.3 for kcat (Fig. 6a) and 6.8 ± 0.6 for kcat/KM (Fig. 6b), with a slope of 1 for both curves indicating that a single group in each

profile needs to be deprotonated to render the enzyme with full activity and binding capacities. The close apparent pKa values suggest that the same group may have been reported in both profiles. Nonetheless, the apparent pKa found for the kcat/KM profile is close to the value expected for the phosphate moiety of CdRP [29]. It is unlikely that the apparent pKa found in the kcat profile refers on the deprotonation of the phosphate moiety of the substrate, since the phosphate group of CdRP is not thought to play any role in the chemical mechanism of this reaction [7,12]. Mutagenesis studies [7] carried out with the MtIGPS identified amino acid residues essential for catalysis (Glu168 and Asn189), and crystal structure determination of EcIGPS and SsIGPS [10,12], as well as the homology modeling of MtIGPS identified the residues positioned to contact CdRP. The MtIGPS Glu168 [7] residue is also conserved in SsIGPS (Glu159) and EcIGPS (Glu163). The deprotonated side chain of this glutamate residue has been proposed to act as a general base in SsIGPS both for CdRP binding and its conversion to IGP [13]. According to Argyrou and Blanchard [30], the presence of some groups, such as carboxylate groups, in close proximity may result in an increase of their pKa values. Thus, even though the calculated apparent pKa value found in the kcat profile (6.0) does not lie in the normal range for ionization of glutamic acids in the active sites of many enzymes [31], it is tempting to suggest that the pH-rate profiles obtained here reflect the ionization of Glu168 in MtIGPS. Moreover, the MtIGPS Asn189 side chain does not have an ionizable group and cannot account for the pHdependent kinetic parameters. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory In order to probe for the rate-limiting nature of proton transfer in the MtIGPS-catalyzed reaction, solvent kinetic isotope effect analysis was carried out (Fig. 7). The value of D2 O V=K = 1.1 ± 0.1 is insignificant and within experimental error, while the value of D2 O V = 1.6 ± 0.1 is significant, though small. To gather information on the number of protons giving rise to the observed solvent isotope effect, a proton inventory on the maximum velocity was performed. The linear shape of the plot (Fig. 7, inset) indicates that only one proton transfer accounts for the observed D2 O V. Solvent isotope effects on V arise from solvent-exchangeable protons being transferred during events following the formation of the complex capable of undergoing catalysis, which include the chemical steps, possible enzyme conformational changes, and

product release. Solvent isotope effects on V/K arise from solventexchangeable protons being transferred during steps in the reaction mechanism from the binding of substrate to the first irreversible step, usually considered to be the release of the first product. Hence, V/K isotope effects are a combination of binding and catalytic isotope effects. We have recently proposed a chemical mechanism for MtIGPS-catalyzed reaction which involves the formation of two intermediates, and the conversion of the first intermediate to the second one renders the reaction irreversible due to release of CO2 (Fig. 8) [8]. The distinct values of D2 O V=K and D2 O V found here suggest that the solvent isotope effects report on different steps of the reaction, with steps up to the formation of the second intermediate, thought to be the first irreversible step, being either insensitive to D2O or associated with high commitment factors, as indicated by the unity value of D2 O V=K. By the same line of reasoning, the small but significant value of D2 O V, along with the linear proton inventory, point to a single, modestly rate-limiting proton transfer occurring in any step following the formation of the second intermediate up to the release of IGP. The results presented here, combined with the chemical mechanism previously published [8], allow us to propose a reaction mechanism for IGP synthesis catalyzed by MtIGPS (Fig. 8). According to this mechanism, the proton-accepting form of the enzyme (E), probably deprotonated Glu168, can bind CdRP and proceed with catalysis through D2O-insensitive steps until the second intermediate (I2) is formed, then IGP is generated and released from the enzyme with one of these steps being sensitive to D2O. Summary In the present work, we described a more efficient chemical synthesis of CdRP, as well as its spectroscopic and spectrometric characterization. Also, a model for ESIPT was proposed to explain the pH-dependent fluorescence behavior of CdRP. KM and kcat values were determined for MtIGPS, and its substrate specificity was calculated. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory suggested that a single, modestly rate-limiting proton transfer occurs in any step following the formation of the second intermediate up to the release of IGP. Accordingly, other chemical steps, possible conformational changes or product release must account for the energy barrier of 8.4 kcal mol¿1 determined by the Arrhe-

nius plot. In addition, pH-rate profiles of MtIGPS kcat and kcat/KM suggested that Glu168 act as a general base that must be deprotonated for binding and catalysis. A model to describe a steady-state kinetic sequence for MtIGPS was presented. MtIGPS has recently been shown to be a potential target for the development of chemotherapeutic agents to treat TB [7]. Enzyme inhibitors make up approximately 25% of the drugs marketed in United States [32]. Enzymes catalyze multi-step chemical reactions and achieve phenomenal rate accelerations by matching protein and substrate chemical groups in the transition state. Inhibitors that take advantage of these chemical interactions are among the most potent and effective drugs known [33]. A spectacular example is given by the femtomolar inhibition of E. coli 5-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase enzyme by 50 -p-Cl-phenylthioDADMe-Immucillin-A, a transition state analogue [34]. Mechanistic analysis should thus always be a top priority for new enzyme-targeted drug programs to allow function-based design of potent inhibitors. Accordingly, the results presented here are expected to contribute to improving our understanding of the mode of action of MtIGPS and thereby providing a solid foundation for function-based drug design of agents to treat TB.
