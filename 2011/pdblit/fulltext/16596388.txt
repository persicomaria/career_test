Abstract The structure of the 2[4Fe≠4S] ferredoxin (PaFd) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which belongs to the Allochromatium vinosum (Alvin) subfamily, has been ∞ determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.32-A resolution, which is the highest up to now for a member of this subfamily of Fds. The main structural features of PaFd are similar to those of AlvinFd. However, the significantly higher resolution of the PaFd structure makes possible a reliable comparison with available high-resolution structures of [4Fe≠4S]-containing Fds, in an effort to rationalize the unusual electrochemical properties of Alvin-like Fds. Three major factors contributing to the reduction potential values of [4Fe≠4S]2+/+ clusters of Fds, namely, the surface accessibility of the clusters, the N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen-bonding network, and the volume of the cavities hosting the clusters, are extensively discussed. The volume of the cavities is introduced in the

present work for the first time, and can in part explain the very negative potential of cluster I of Alvin-like Fds.

Introduction
Clusters of Fe and S atoms, with the core composition of [4Fe≠4S], are found at the active site of many proteins in a wide range of biological organisms, from bacteria to mammals [1, 2]. The [4Fe≠4S] proteins without any other role than electron transfer are called ferredoxins (Fds) [3], including low-potential Fds with one or two [4Fe≠4S]2+/+ clusters, and the highpotential Fds with one [4Fe≠4S]3+/2+ cluster. Some Fds contain one [4Fe≠4S] and one [3Fe≠4S] cluster. Apart from electron transport, other functions have been attributed to [4Fe≠4S] proteins, including catalysis carried out by the cluster, regulation of gene expression or enzyme activity, O2 and iron sensing, and the generation and stabilization of radical intermediates [4]. Thus, the expansion in functional capabilities of this class of biological metal cofactors calls for more detailed and thorough structural and functional characterization of its iron≠sulfur clusters. The Fd family containing two [4Fe≠4S] clusters is quite widespread, mainly among bacteria and archaea [3]. Up to now, on the basis of their amino acid

sequences, two distinct subfamilies of 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds have been identified: the first includes the shortest Fds (55≠61 amino acids) represented by the proteins isolated from clostridia (clostridial Fds), and the second displays longer proteins (of about 82 amino acids), the first of which to be thoroughly characterized was from the purple sulfur bacterium Allochromatium vinosum (AlvinFd) [5]. The two clusters in the first family are bound to the proteins by a pair of CXXCXXC∆∆∆CP (X is a variable amino acid) motifs containing the eight necessary cysteine residues (Fig. 1). In all 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds of known 3D structure (Table 1) the relative arrangement of the two clusters is the same. The presence of two redox sites at a biologically relevant ∞ electron-transfer distance (``center-to-center'' 12 A, ∞ ``edge-to-edge'' 6.2 A) [21, 22] suggests an electron-relay function [23] that may be linked to the role of the Fd as a redox mediator between large electron-producing/using enzymes. Such a function is well documented in the case of the protein from Clostridium pasteurianum, which mediates electron transport between larger metalloenzymes such as pyruvate-Fd oxidoreductase and hydrogenase [24, 25]. However, the nature and the complete list of redox partners for 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds have not yet been clearly identified in most of the cases. Despite the fact that these Fds are not found in eukaryotic organisms, the characteristic structural motif of their two clusters constitutes part of multisubunit metalloenzymes in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms [26], like hydrogenase [27], dimethyl sulfoxide reductase [28], photosystem I [29] and respiration complex I [30]. In most of these examples, vectorial electron transfer between the two clusters is considered to be an essential step of the overall mechanism. Representative structures of the shorter Fds are the ones from Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus Fd

∞ (PasFd) at 2.0-A resolution [6] and C. acidurici Fd ∞ (CauFd) at atomic resolution (0.94 A) [8], whereas for the longer Fds structural data exist for the AlvinFd ∞ ∞ (2.1 A) [9] and Thauera aromatica Fd (TaFd) (2.9 A) [10]. Atomic-resolution structures for [4Fe≠4S] proteins are few (bold in Table 1). For comparison, a wealth of synthetic models with a [4Fe≠4S] core have been synthesized over the last 30 years, and for some of them structural information is available for all three accessible [4Fe≠4S]3+/2+/+ oxidation states [31≠33]. Moreover, since it has been established that one of the proteins of the enzyme nitrogenase contains a [4Fe≠4S]2+ cluster that is amenable to one-electron or even two-electron reduction [34, 35], Scott el al. [36] have recently synthesized a model compound containing a ``hyperreduced'' [4Fe≠4S]0 core. The amino acid sequences (Fig. 1) and the X-ray structures (Table 1) have established that the long Fds of the A. vinosum subfamily include a six amino acid insertion between the cluster II coordinating Cys40 and Cys49, an extensive C-terminal a-helix (residues 67≠80) and a loop connecting it to the core of the molecule, close to the [4Fe≠4S] cluster referred to as cluster II. The second [4Fe≠4S] cluster in these Fds, referred to as cluster I, has a structural environment similar to that of the corresponding cluster I of the shorter, clostridial Fds (Fig. 2). Electrochemical studies of the A. vinosum subfamily Fds have shown that in all cases clusters I and II have very negative and widely differing reduction potential (E∞) values [¿585 to ¿675 and ¿420 to ¿485 mV vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively]. In contrast, clusters I and II of the clostridial Fds have equal potentials of about ¿400 mV. The E∞ values of all Fds considered in this article are presented in Table 2. ∞ The present study reports the 1.32-A resolution molecular structure as well as the electrochemical char-

Materials and methods
Protein cloning, expression and purification The gene coding for PaFd was PCR-extracted from genomic DNA with two primers incorporating NdeI (on the 5¢ side) and PstI sites. The digested PCR fragment was cloned in the pT7-7 plasmid, the gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and the protein was purified as previously described for AlvinFd [41].

Electrochemistry The electrochemical properties of PaFd were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The experiment was carried out using a low-volume electrochemical cell [42] and a Bipotentiostat AFCBP1 from Pine Instrument Company. The counter electrode was a Pt wire, the reference electrode a saturated calomel electrode 4 M KCl (Pine, AC11420SLS) and the working electrode was an Au electrode (Pine, AFE1E050AU). All potentials are referenced to the NHE, taking E(Hg/Hg2Cl2)=+244 mV, at 25 ∞C. The concentration of the protein sample was approximately 1.5 mM, in 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane pH 7 and its volume, in each measurement, was about 8 lL. A mixture of methyl viologen (E∞MV=¿455 mV) and 4¢,4¢¢-dimethyl-1¢,1¢¢-trimethylene-2¢,2¢¢-dipyridinium bromide (E∞DMTQ= ¿680 mV) [43] at concentrations up to 50 lM was used as a redox mediator. All measurements were made in a strictly anaerobic atmosphere of Ar. Crystallization and X-ray diffraction data Crystals were obtained by the vapor diffusion technique using the hanging-drop method. The whole crystallization experiment was carried out inside a glove bag under Ar, ensuring that during the vapor equilibration procedure the hanging drops would not come into contact with the atmospheric air, thus assuring that the protein would remain intact, as proteins of this family undergo oxidation reactions leading to their denaturation. The preliminary crystallization tests with (NH4)2HPO4 as the precipitant resulted in brown platelike crystals which were optimized with the addition of NaCl. Attempts to grow crystals in the presence of dithiothreitol did not affect in any way either the crystal growth and shape or its diffraction capability and mosaicity; thus, it was not used in the following experiments. In contrast, the presence of both Na+ and Cl¿ at high concentration proved crucial in the optimization of the crystals. Optimized crystals were obtained in hanging drops by mixing 1 lL of 10 mg mL¿1 protein in 10 mM N-(2hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N¢-ethanesulfonic acid pH 7.4 and 100 mM NaCl and 1 lL reservoir solution containing 3.2 M (NH4)2HPO4 and 230 mM NaCl. Darkbrown crystals of long parallelepiped shape of about 1.2 mm ∑ 0.2 mm ∑ 0.2 mm, appeared within 48 h at 4 ∞C. The X-ray data were collected on the wiggler beamline BW7b (EMBL/DESY, Hamburg) using a MAR345 image plate detector. Prior to data collection the crystal was immersed in mother liquor containing additionally 20% (v/v) glycerol as a cryo-protectant and was flashed-cooled under the ¿173 ∞C cryo-stream attached to the goniometer. The crystal, space group P212121, one molecule per asymmetric unit and solvent ∞ content of about 48%, diffracted X-rays to 1.32-A Bragg spacings (Table 3). The ice formation during the data collection was detrimental to the completeness, which

approached 92% overall. All data were processed, integrated and scaled using the HKL suite [44]. Intensities were converted into structure factor amplitudes and scaled using the program TRUNCATE [45]. Then, a 3% fraction of the data was marked as the reference set for the calculation of the Rfree statistics throughout the refinement procedure [46]. Structure determination and refinement The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using AlvinFd as a search model (1BLU) [9]. A ∞ rotation search at the resolution range 3.0≠15.0 A was followed by a translation search of all rotation solutions at the same resolution using MOLREP [47]. The model coordinate set was placed within the asymmetric unit, yielding an initial R factor of 40.2% and a correlation coefficient of 60.3%. The molecular replacement solution was subjected to rigid-body refinement, giving a crystallographic R of 44% using the program REFMAC [48]. The correctness of the solution was confirmed by inspection of the Fo¿Fc difference map, revealing the positions of the iron and sulfur cluster atoms, absent in the initial model. Further refinement implementing maximum likelihood was performed using REFMAC at ∞ 15.0≠1.32 A interrupted by visual inspection of the electron density maps, 2Fo¿Fc and Fo¿Fc with the graphics program O [49] and refitting of the model, where necessary. The standard restraints of the program were applied in the protein model, whereas bond distances involving cluster atoms were altered targeting the average values, as derived in the high-resolution Fd structures (Table 1). Solvent water molecules were

449

positioned with automatic selection using ARP/wARP [50] and wherever necessary manually, after a close inspection of the difference maps. At this stage the refinement, based on F2, was continued using the program SHELX97 [51]. The protein was refined using conjugate gradient least squares and at the last cycle block-diagonal matrix least squares in order to calculate the standard uncertainties. Default antibumping restraints to prevent atomic collisions, chiral volume restraints to the CA atoms and other chiral C atoms, planarity restraints for the peptide bonds and aromatic, guanidine and carboxylate groups of the side chains were applied, as implemented in SHELX. All bond distances in the protein molecule were restrained within ∞ 0.02 A. No restraints were applied to the distances or angles involving the atoms of the clusters in any combination and to the Fe∆∆∆SCys bond distances. All nonsolvent atoms were treated anisotropically, but for connected atoms the anisotropic displacement parameters along the bond were restrained to be equal within ∞ 0.01 A2. Because of the relatively low data-to-parameters ratio, water atoms were restrained to be approximately isotropic with an estimated standard deviations ∞ of 0.1 A2. In the final cycle of the block-diagonal leastsquares refinement, the data of the reference and the working sets were merged. During the SHELX refinement the occupancies of the water atoms were checked. A refinement cycle was performed with the thermal parameters fixed and the occupancies released. Subsequently, the occupancies were fixed at constant values of 0.5 or 1 depending on the value obtained in the test cycle. No electron density was apparent for the last residue, whereas the density at the previous residue (Lys81) was diffuse, leading to a model of two alternative conformations with occupancies of 0.5. When the refinement converged, a last cycle of block-diagonal least-squares refinement was performed in which only the positional parameters of the protein atoms, and the Fe and S atoms were included. This allowed the calculation of the standard uncertainties. In order to determine whether there was bias induced by the restraints on the protein model, a second refinement test was performed in which the restraints had been removed and no shift was suppressed. The model thus resulting exhibited no difference from the refined structures regarding the cluster distances and insignificant deviations were observed with regard to the conformations of the long side chain residues. In order to assess the correctness of the refinement and to check that the cluster atom positions do not suffer from any bias originating from the input model, as well as their standard uncertainties, the randomization procedure as described for the CauFd (2FDN) [8] and Alvin high-potential Fd (1BOY/1CKU) [19] refinements was implemented. The atomic coordinates of the Fe and S atoms were changed randomly so that each atom ∞ was displaced by 0.3 A from its refined position. Subsequently, the model was refined to convergence, using the conjugate-gradient least-squares algorithm. The

procedure was repeated ten times. Within the calculated errors, the average distances and angles of the cluster derived from the refinement and the randomization procedure are identical (Table S1). The structure of PaFd has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry PDB code: 2FGO). Figures 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 were generated by PyMOL [52]. The free volume of the clusters' cavities was calculated by the graphics program GRASP [53].

Results
Electrochemistry The electrochemical properties of PaFd were studied by cyclic voltammetry. A typical voltammogram is shown in Fig. 3. Two redox transitions can be identified at ¿475 and ¿665 mV (Table 2). They are assigned to the [4Fe≠4S]2+/+ clusters II and I, respectively, on the basis of the sequence similarities (Fig. 1) between PaFd and AlvinFd, for which electrochemical properties have been correlated with structural data [37, 54]. Description of the structure ∞ The final model of the protein of about 41∑30∑29 A3 (Fig. 2) contains 81 amino acid residues, two [4Fe≠4S] clusters and 102 water molecules distributed over 141 positions. The N-terminal residue is a serine (Fig. 1) as expected [55]. The carboxy-terminal residue Ala82 is not visible in the crystal structure. The side chains of residues Ser1 and Lys81 are distributed over two alternative

conformations with occupancies of 0.5 each. Disorder is also observed for the side chain of Val31, with two conformations of 0.7 and 0.3 occupancies. All //w residue values lie in the most favored (89.9%) or in the additional allowed regions (10.1%) of the Ramachandran plot as calculated by PROCHECK [56]. All bond distances and angles except for the last observed residue at the C terminus (N81≠CA81≠CB81 110∞ instead of 121.0∞) lie in the range of values observed in the structures of small molecules [57]. A sequence alignment between PaFd and AlvinFd (Fig. 1) reveals an identity of 69.5%. The sequences are mainly similar about the cluster areas, while the largest sequence deviations are observed at the C terminus of the proteins. Superposition and least-squares fitting of the main chain atoms of the two structures resulted in an ∞ average root-mean-square deviation of 0.282 A, as derived by the program ALIGN [58]. Nevertheless, the adequately better resolution of the present structure contains structural information of much improved ∞ accuracy (estimated standard deviation 0.01≠0.02 A for the distances between cluster atoms) suitable for comparison with the high-resolution structures of other Fds. The temperature (B) factors per residue plotted for main chain and side chain atoms independently (Fig. S1) show that apart from the flexible region Gln25≠Glu28, the rest of the structure is well defined. The latter region was shown to be highly flexible in CauFd crystals at ¿173 ∞C with two different conformations [8]. As an improvement over the AlvinFd structure, only the two side chains of residues Glu27 and Glu28 exhibit mean B ∞ values greater than 50 A2. The B values of all water molecules, except for nine that are partially occupied, ∞ are well below 50 A2. The electron density of the area around the clusters is very well defined, as shown in Fig. 4 for cluster I.

The main structural features of the PaFd structure (Fig. 2) are very similar to those of AlvinFd. They both share a well-defined 3.5-turn C-terminal a-helix (Ser67≠ Gly80) (Fig. 5) and the otherwise limited secondary structure elements. The latter comprise a one-turn ahelix (Cys49≠Cys53) and another, cluster-joining 310helix (Cys14≠Cys18), as well as two antiparallel b-sheets, one between Ile23≠Gln25 and Tyr30≠Ile32 and a very short one between Leu2≠Lys3 and Leu60≠Asp61. Numerous b-turns complete the folding of the protein around the two clusters. In both PaFd and AlvinFd, the Ser67≠Gly80 a-helix connected via the loop Asp56≠ Glu66 to the compact clostridial Fd-like part of the protein has its axis almost perpendicular to the axis connecting the centers of the two clusters (Fig. 2) and looks like a lid on one end of the ovoid core encasing the clusters. The bending back of the C-terminal helix is achieved by the Asp61≠Asn64 turn, which coincides with the AlvinFd Asp61≠His64 turn. Since PaFd has an aspartic acid residue at position 62, Pro62 of AlvinFd is not mandatory to orient the C-terminal a-helix [9]. As in the AlvinFd structure, four of the a-helix residues, Leu71, Lys74, Tyr75 and Ile78, interact with residues of the cluster II coordinating region. Lys74 plays the key role in orienting the helix and the connecting loop to the main body of the protein (Fig. 5). Its NZ atom establishes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl O atoms of residues Pro34, Cys37, a fully occupied water molecule and the carboxylate group of Glu66, which in turn hydrogen-bonds to Ser1, thus bridging the carboxyl with the amino terminus. Moreover, hydrophobic interactions are observed between the nonpolar side chains of the helix (Leu71, Tyr75 and Ile78) and residues Val41, His43 and Leu36, respectively. In particular, there is a relay of interactions between aromatic residues: the Tyr75 ring approaches almost perpendicularly

the His43 side chain plane, which in turn approaches the Tyr44 phenyl ring at an angle. The latter lies close and parallel to the amide group of Gln48. The aforementioned nonpolar interactions shield the coordinating Cys40 of cluster II from the solvent. Additional interactions involve the hydrogen bond between C=O∆∆∆H≠N of residues Asn64 and Ser1, respectively, which has the effect of connecting the N and C ends of the molecule, in addition to the hydrogen-bonding network described before. Other electrostatic interactions in the polypeptide chain contribute to the overall stabilization of the molecule, as discussed later. Even though the number of the located water molecules in the structure of PaFd is far greater than in AlvinFd (141 vs. 85 positions ), the number of structural water molecules is conserved. The additional water molecules are located mostly at the surface of the protein and form hydrogen bonds with polar residues or with each other. Buried water molecules hydrogen-bonding to polar side chains offer stabilization and alternative conformations of the side and/or the main chains of this small protein in the proximity of cluster II.

A pseudo-b-sheet is formed by four water molecules that bridge two extended chains, residues 1≠4 and 30≠32 (Fig. 6b). The number of water molecules in this structural element is larger than in the lower-resolution AlvinFd model but is equal to that of the high-resolution CauFd structure. Geometry of the [4Fe≠4S] clusters In the 2[4Fe≠4S] Fd structures the covalent linkages of the two clusters to cysteine residues have a significant role in the folding process.

∞ 2.30 A, respectively), different spatial relationships are observed within each cluster, as shown in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4 compares the Fe≠S bond lengths of PaFd with those of other high-resolution Fd structures. The equivalent Fe and S atoms were determined after structural alignment of the coordinating cysteines (Fig. 7). However, the numbering of Fe and S atoms for each structure was kept as reported. Cluster I As is shown in Table 4, cluster I of PaFd, coordinated by Cys8, Cys11, Cys14 and Cys53 (Fig. 1) exhibits an unusually large spread of its Fe≠S bond lengths. S1 ∞ forms the two shortest Fe≠S bonds, 2.21 and 2.26 A, with the Fe3 and Fe2 atoms coordinated by Cys14 and Cys11, respectively (Fig. 7). The same S1 atom is involved in the shortest S∆∆∆S distances with S2 and S4, whereas the longest S∆∆∆S distance is between S2 and S4 (Table 5). In the nearly parallel faces of the cluster cube, the longest Fe∆∆∆Fe distance is observed between Fe2 and

Fe4. It is interesting to note that Fe2 is involved in the shortest Fe∆∆∆SG bond and Fe4 is involved in the longest. On the other hand, the shortest Fe∆∆∆Fe distance is Fe1∆∆∆Fe3, which belongs to the same face as the longest S∆∆∆S distance, S2∆∆∆S4. The Fe∆∆∆Fe distances are widely ∞ ∞ spread over 0.13 A around a mean value of 2.76 A. By comparing dyads of S∆∆∆S distances belonging to opposite faces, we conclude that the tetrahedron of the four S atoms of cluster I is characterized by D2 symmetry. ∞ Particularly, the 0.07-A difference of the longest S2∆∆∆S4 vs. the opposite S1∆∆∆S3 distance (Fig. 7) infers the loss of the S4 symmetry axis and reduction of the cluster symmetry from D2d to D2. The same applies for the tetrahedron of the four Fe atoms. Atom S1 appears to be the major site of the cluster subjected to strain by the protein matrix. Taking the van ∞ der Waals radii of S and H as 1.85 and 1.2 A, respectively, atom S1 exhibits two close contacts, with H atoms bound to C atoms (Table 6), where close distances around atom S1 of PaFd are compared with equivalent distances in other high-resolution Fd structures.

∞ 3.5 A away from the S2 and Fe4 atoms, thus forming an equilateral triangle. Cluster II Cluster II coordinated by Cys37, Cys40, Cys49 and ∞ Cys18 (Fig. 1) exhibits a smaller spread (0.09 A) of the Fe≠S bond lengths (Table 4) and shows a different distortion compared with cluster I. Along the compression axis perpendicular to faces Fe1, S2, Fe3, S4 and Fe2, S1, ∞ ∞ Fe4, S3 two short (2.26 A) and two long (2.29 A) Fe≠S bond distances are observed. The compression axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the whole ovoid Fd molecule. The longest Fe≠S distances are also perpendicular to that axis. The S∆∆∆S distances (Table 5) can be separated into two short ones, S1∆∆∆S2 and S3∆∆∆S4, along the compression axis, and four long ones, of which the longest, S1∆∆∆S3, is perpendicular to the compression axis. The Fe∆∆∆Fe distances (Table 5) are distributed around ∞ an average value of 2.73±0.11 A, which is smaller than ∞ the corresponding value (2.76±0.13 A) of cluster I. The differences in the Fe∆∆∆Fe distances of opposite faces, in correlation with the S∆∆∆S distances, suggest a reduction of symmetry to point group D2 for cluster II also. A complementary way to compare the distortion of the clusters is to consider the dihedral angles of the faces (Table 8), i.e., the discrepancies of these faces from planarity. These are defined as the angles between the lines perpendicular to the two planes defined by three atoms of each face. Thus, Fe1≠Fe3 in Table 8 refers to the dihedral angle between planes Fe1≠S2≠Fe3 and Fe1≠ S4≠Fe3. The dihedral angles of the faces containing Fe1, S2, Fe3, S4 and Fe2, S1, Fe4, S3 of cluster II (these faces are perpendicular to the compression axis) are smaller than the average value (20.2∞), whereas those of the faces Fe1, S3, Fe2, S4 and Fe3, S1, Fe4, S2 are larger, confirming the distortion of the cluster from tetragonal D2d to D2. This agrees with the description of the BtFd cluster [11]. The wide dispersion of the cluster II dihedral angles of PaFd is very prominent among the structures examined.

Fig. 8 Close non-hydrogen-bonding contacts around atom S1 of PaFd cluster I (see also Table 6). The color code is as in Fig. 2

though H atoms were not included in the refinement, their positions were calculated assuming normal sp3 hybridization. Thus, S1 has the following short distances ∞ ∞ (1) 2.65 A with H≠CA of Cys53 (S1∆∆∆CACys53=3.57 A) ∞ with the H≠CG atoms of Val13 and (2) 2.78 and 3.05 A ∞ (Val13 CG2∆∆∆S1=3.62 A), if the free rotation of CG2 around the CB≠CG2 bond is taken into account (Fig. 8, Table 6). The relatively short Fe≠S1 bonds observed in the PaFd structure may result from the aforementioned close contacts pushing S1 towards the center of the cluster. This suggestion is supported by the NH (Cys14)∆∆∆S1 hydrogen bond (Table 7), which is longer compared with the other NH∆∆∆S bonds observed in both clusters. The same has been observed for Azotobacter vinelandi FdI (AvFdI) [16]. The network of N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds involving both inorganic and cysteine S atoms is conserved in cluster I of the PaFd, AlvinFd [9], the clostridial Fds [8] as well as Bacillus thermoproteolyticus Fd (BtFd) [11] (Table 7). The single noncoordinating Cys57, which is in the vicinity of cluster I (Fig. 2), adopts a conformation with its SG facing the cluster,

The clusters define intertwined tetrahedra of S and Fe atoms, whose parameters are shown in Table 9 for both clusters of PaFd; rFe (rS) [31] refers to the average distances from the center of gravity of the eight atoms of the cluster to its apices, and bFe (bS) refers to the average of the angles formed between two of the aforementioned vectors divided by 2 (b should be 54.7∞ for a perfect tetrahedron). Note that these calculations are approximate for the PaFd, since they apply to exact D2d symmetry. Since VFe and VS are the volumes of the tetrahedra, Table 9 shows that the PaFd clusters are assembled from a relatively small (4Fe) and a larger (4S) tetrahedron as in other Fds [8]. In contrast to cluster II,

cluster I assumes a volume that falls within the range observed with other Fds and model compounds [8]. For cluster II, besides the large volume of the S tetrahedron, the distribution of the S∆∆∆S distances (two short ones along the compression axis and four long ones in the faces perpendicular to it) explains the observed variation in the dihedral angles discussed before. Accordingly, the mean value of the dihedral angles (Table 8) for cluster I is 18.3∞ with a smaller distribution around this value compared with cluster II. The rather higher distortion of cluster II compared with cluster I is additionally reflected by the variation in Fe≠SG tilt angles (Table 10). The tilt angle is the angle between the Fe≠SG bond and the cube diagonal [8] and its deviation from zero is related primarily to the departure of each Fe4S4 core from ideal Td symmetry. The variation of the tilt angles of cluster II is larger than that for cluster I, the largest being that of the Fe2≠SG40 bond (20.7∞). These observations hold also for CauFd (Table 10); therefore, the singularity of Fe2 does not depend on whether the 41≠47 loop (not present in CauFd) between the following two cysteine ligands is present or not. The torsion angles N≠ CA≠CB≠CG and Fe≠SG≠CB≠CA of the coordinated cysteines (Table S2) also reflect cluster distortion. Cys40 of cluster II that exhibits the largest tilt angle shows the highest difference in the torsion angles as well. In the preceding analysis of the cluster geometries the role of the polypeptide chain was pointed out. The N≠ H∆∆∆SG distances (Table 7) may be additional indications of this role. The N≠H∆∆∆SG distances for cluster II are substantially shorter compared with the ones of cluster I. These values correlate with the corresponding longer Fe≠SG bond lengths (Table 4) in cluster II. In particular, SG18 and SG37 form two strong N≠H∆∆∆SG hydrogen bonds and therefore the corresponding Fe≠SG bond lengths are longer. The same correlation is valid in the

Discussion
Up to now, the structures of AlvinFd [9] and TaFd [10] ∞ at 2.1 and 2.9 A, respectively (Table 1), have not allowed a detailed appraisal of the structural origin of the large reduction potential difference between clusters of the Alvin-like 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds. Theoretical studies have aimed at considering and computing all factors that control the E∞ values in [4Fe≠4S]-containing proteins [60≠62]. However, none of the relevant studies up to now have provided a valid explanation for the approximately 200 mV difference between the two clusters of AlvinFd and the approximately 250 mV difference between cluster I of AlvinFd and the clusters of clostridial Fds (Table 2). Replacement of charged residues in clostridial 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds [26, 63] and the [4Fe≠4S][3Fe≠4S] AvFdI [64] has probed the contribution to the E∞ values of the electrostatic potential around the clusters. However, in both Fds, small or moderate effects were observed. More recently, a significant positive shift in the reduction potential of the [4Fe≠4S] cluster of AvFdI was observed when histidine residues, especially in their protonated form at low pH, were introduced in the cluster's vicinity [65]. ∞ The present structure of PaFd at 1.32-A resolution, combined with the high-resolution structures of other [4Fe≠4S] Fds (Table 1), permits a rational analysis of the reduction potential values (Table 2) mainly based on the following three parameters (Table 11): (1) solvent accessibility of the clusters, (2) number and type of N≠ H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds and (3) volume of the cavities hosting the clusters. Solvent accessibility of the clusters The cysteine SG atom corresponding to the second cysteine of the cluster's coordinating motif in most 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds (Fig. 1) is the least buried atom of the cluster. For that reason, the accessible surface of these SG atoms in high-resolution Fds was calculated (Table 11) with the program AREAMOL [66]. The more accessible a cluster is to the solvent, the more positive its E∞ value is expected to be, since the reduced cluster {[4Fe≠4S](Cys)4]3¿} is more charged than the oxidized one {[4Fe≠4S](Cys)4]2¿}. This argument was used [37] to explain the fact that the more exposed clusters of clostridial Fds exhibit more positive E∞ values compared with the less exposed AlvinFd clusters (Table 11). The surface accessibility of the SG atoms has been probed in molecular variants of AlvinFd designed to increase the accessibility of either cluster I by replacing the bulky

Val13 and Val55 residues by glycine, and the noncoordinating Cys57 (Fig. 2) by alanine [37, 67], or that of cluster II by removing the six-residue Val41≠Pro47 loop or half of the a-helix or both [37]. In both cases, significant positive shifts were observed, stressing the importance of the bulky residues around cluster I or the 41≠47 loop/a-helix around cluster II, although these shifts did not cover the whole differences in potentials. The low-potential Alvin-like AvFdIII (Table 2), for which no structural information is available, also possesses valine at the position corresponding to Val13 of AlvinFd [38]. On the other hand, the Alvin-like TaFd has alanine instead of valine at position 13 and the E∞ of its cluster I is substantially more positive compared with that of other Fds of the AlvinFd family [39], confirming the importance of the bulkiness of residue 13 (Table 2). In the L44S molecular variant of AvFdI [68], the bulky residue leucine, corresponding to Val13 in AlvinFd, was replaced by serine, as is the case in the corresponding position of cluster II in the clostridial-type PasFd [69]. The effect on the potential was significant (+94 mV) and it was attributed to the introduction of a OH∆∆∆SG hydrogen bond, together with an accompanying movement of a water molecule, rather than to the bulkiness of the leucine side chain. However, if such a OH∆∆∆S hydrogen bond is the main factor controlling the potential of cluster II in PasFd, and since at the corresponding position around cluster I there is alanine and not serine, one would have expected cluster I of PasFd to exhibit a significantly different E∞ value compared with cluster II, which is not what was observed, since the two clusters of PasFd have indistinguishable reduction potentials [69]. In addition, the clostridial Fd CauFd contains alanine at the corresponding positions, which has no capacity to form such OH∆∆∆SG hydrogen bonds, yet the [4Fe≠4S]2+/+ clusters display reduction potentials of the same value as those of PasFd [69]. Therefore, the significantly increased E∞ value of L44S AvFdI should be attributed mainly to the less bulky side chain of serine compared with that of valine. Although the increased cluster accessibility generally correlates with less negative E∞ values, this factor alone cannot explain PaFd's more negative potential of cluster I compared with that of cluster II, since the former is more exposed than the latter (Table 11). Hydrogen bonds In Table 7, the N≠H∆∆∆S or N≠H∆∆∆SG hydrogen bonds, as derived from the structures of PaFd, AvFdI, CauFd and BtFd, are listed, including the corresponding distances between the amide nitrogen and the sulfur atoms. The importance of hydrogen bonds between the amide hydrogen of the main chain and inorganic sulfur or cysteine SG atoms of the [4Fe≠4S] clusters in Fds has frequently been stressed in the past [69, 70]. It is believed that these hydrogen bonds stabilize the reduced form of the [4Fe≠4S] cluster by attenuating charge density on the

457

metal-bound S atom. Therefore, more and stronger N≠ H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds are expected to render the reduction potential of the clusters more positive. On the basis of this argument, the small number (five) of N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds in AvFdI might contribute, in part, to the very negative potential (Table 11) of the [4Fe≠4S] cluster. Cluster I of PaFd exhibits eight hydrogen bonds, the same as cluster I of CauFd and BtFd, with minute variations in the mean N∆∆∆S distance (3.50, 3.45 and ∞ 3.53 A, respectively). On the other hand, in the case of cluster II of PaFd, one hydrogen bond is missing compared with the situation in clusters of CauFd (Table 7). This difference might contribute to upshift the E∞ value of cluster II of clostridial Fds compared with that of the corresponding clusters of Alvin-like Fds (Tables 2, 11) [37]. The occurrence of N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds was also proposed to contribute to increasing the reduction potential of the [4Fe≠4S]3+/2+ cluster in the high-potential Fds, since chemically synthesized proteins of this type, with fewer N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds, exhibit significantly lower reduction potentials compared with the wild-type protein [71]. The same trend was also observed in the case of [4Fe≠4S]-containing inorganic analogues [72]. However, it should be stressed that the N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen-bonding network as a single factor cannot justify all the differences in reduction potential values of Table 11, since cluster I with eight N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen bonds has a more negative potential compared with cluster II of PaFd with seven such hydrogen bonds. Volume of the cavities hosting the [4Fe≠4S] clusters A striking feature of PaFd, which has not yet been considered elsewhere as contributing to the reduction potential of [4Fe≠4S]2+/+ cluster, is the volume of the protein cavities in which the clusters are nested. Upon reduction, a [4Fe≠4S]2+ cluster must accommodate an additional electron and it expands in volume. This has been observed, for instance, for the analogous compound [Fe4S4(SPh)4]2¿/3¿, in which the tetrahedron of S atoms, Vs, increases upon reduction from 5.54 to ∞ 5.76 A3 [31]. It must be stressed, however, that no protein structure containing a [4Fe≠4S]+ cluster has been determined to date. Since the [4Fe≠4S] cluster must expand upon reduction, the smaller the cavity hosting the cluster, the more difficult it would be to add an electron, and hence the lower its E∞ value. Indeed, the volume of cluster I in PaFd is about 20% smaller compared with that of cluster II and the clusters of CauFd (Table 11). This factor could in part explain why in all Alvin-like Fds, cluster II lying in a cavity of larger volume shows a less negative potential compared with cluster I, although it exhibits less surface accessibility and has one N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen bond less, compared with cluster I. The only apparent discrepancy with the foregoing rationale is cluster I of AvFdI (Table 11), for which the

volume of the cavity is even larger than for clostridial Fds, yet its potential is similar to the value of cluster I of Alvin-like Fds. However, in addition to the significantly smaller number of N≠H∆∆∆S bonds, the major difference of the AvFdI [4Fe≠4S] cluster from the clostridial Fds is that it is completely buried in the protein. Therefore, in this case, the cavity hosting the cluster is larger, but the potential can still be very negative, probably owing to both the cluster's less effective N≠H∆∆∆S hydrogen-bonding network as well as its inaccessibility (Table 11). The work reported herein provides a sufficiently detailed structure to envision probing unaddressed features that may be relevant to set the reduction potential of [4Fe≠4S] clusters in proteins. Indeed, the quality of the previously released structures for AlvinFd and TaFd were not adequate to get hints about the reasons for the peculiar reduction properties exhibited by this class of proteins. The analysis derived from the present highresolution structure has pointed to the constrained environment of PaFd cluster I as a major contributing factor. Such features cannot easily be reproduced with synthetic analogues and they have to be probed with a manageable molecule for which accurate structural data are available. Clearly, PaFd may thus become such a workhorse for the Alvin-type family of Fds thanks to the structural model described here.
