Abstract

Cytochrome c2 serves as the secondary electron donor that reduces the photo-oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer in photosynthetic bacteria. Cytochrome c2 from Rhodobacter sphaeroides has been crystallized in three different forms. At high ionic strength, crystals of a hexagonal space group (P6~22) were obtained, while at low ionic strength, triclinic (P1) and tetragonal (P4~2~2) crystals were formed. The three-dimensional structures of the cytochrome in all three crystal forms have been determined by X-ray diffraction at resolutions of 2.20 ~ (hexagonal), 1.95 A, (triclinic) and 1.53 A (tetragonal). The most significant difference observed was the binding of an imidazole molecule to the iron atom of the heme group in the hexagonal structure. This binding displaces the sulfur atom of Met l00, which forms the axial ligand in the triclinic and tetragonal structures.
Introduction

Cytochromes form a ubiquitous class of proteins that serve as electron carriers in different energytransducing systems (reviewed in Moore & Pettigrew, 1990). In the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Rb. sphaeroides, cytochrome c2 is a 14 kDa water-soluble protein that contains one covalently bound heme as its prosthetic group (Vernon & Kamen, 1954). This cytochrome, along with the membrane-bound photosynthetic reaction center (RC) and cytochrome bc~, carry out the photosynthetic electron-transfer processes in Rb. sphaeroides (reviewed by Nicholls & Ferguson, 1992). The cytochrome c2 serves as the secondary electron donor that upon binding to the periplasmic surface

of the RC transfers an electron to the photo-oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer (D ~) (Prince, Cogdell & Crofts, 1974; Prince, Baccarini-Melandri, Hauska, Melandri & Crofts, 1975; Overfield, Wraight & Devault, 1979; Rosen, Okamura & Feher, 1980; Rosen, Okamura, Abresch, Valkris & Feher, 1983). The oxidized ferricytochrome c2 is re-reduced by cytochrome bc~ to regenerate ferrocytochrome c2 (reviewed in Crofts & Wraight, 1983). The X-ray crystal structures of the RC from two photosynthetic bacteria, Rhodopseudomonas viridis (Deisenhofer, Epp, Miki, Huber & Michel, 1985) and Rb. sphaeroides (Allen et al., 1986; Chang et al., 1986; Allen, Feher, Yeates, Komiya & Rees, 1987; Chang, EI-Kabbani, Tiede, Norris & Schiffer, 1991) have been determined. In Rps. viridis, a tetraheme cytochrome is permanently bound to the RC (Thornber, Olson, Williams & Clayton, 1969; Deisenhofer, Epp, Miki, Huber & Michel, 1985). In Rb. sphaeroides, cytochrome c2 is an exogenous water-soluble protein that forms a transient complex with the RC. To understand the structure of the complex and the mechanism of electron transfer, a knowledge of the cytochrome structure is essential. Different docking models for the interaction between cytochrome c2 from Rb. sphaeroides and the RC have been proposed (Allen, Feher, Yeates, Komiya & Rees, 1987; Tiede & Chang, 1988; Caffrey, Bartsch & Cusanovich, 1992). In all the models negatively charged glutamic and aspartic acid side chains on the periplasmic surface of the RC were postulated to interact with positively charged side chains on the cytochrome. Since the X-ray structure of the cytochrome c'2 from Rb. sphaeroides was not available, these docking models relied on the known structures of homologous cytochromes from two other species of purple photosynthetic bacteria,

Rhodospirillum rubrum (Salemme, Freer, Xuong, Alden & Kraut, 1973) and Rhodobacter capsulatus (Benning et al., 1991). In this work, we describe the structure determination of cytochrome c2 from Rb. sphaeroides in three different crystal forms prepared under different crystallization conditions. Preliminary accounts of this work have been presented (Allen, 1988; Axelrod et al., 1992a,b).

Experimental procedures
Purification of O'tochrome c,
Cytochrome c2 from R. sphaeroides was obtained from an overproducing strain cycA1, harboring the plasmid pC2P404.1 (Brandner, McEwan, Kaplan & Donohue, 1989). Cell growth and harvest were performed as described by Feher & Okamura (1978); periplasmic extracts containing cytochrome c2 were prepared according to Rott, Fitch, Meyer & Donohue (1992). The cytochrome was purified as described by Bartsch (1978) with the following modifications: The cytochrome c2 was precipitated from the periplasmic extract by 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The resulting pellet was applied to a hydrophobic column (n-butyl-Toyopearl 250S from Toso-Haas) equilibrated with 60% saturated (NH4)2SO 4. Following a wash with the equilibration salt (five volumes), the cytochrome was eluted from the column with 40% saturated (NH4)2SO4 and dialyzed against 10 m M TE buffer.* Two additional chromatographic steps with an anion exchange column [dimethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Toyopearl 250S] and a cation exchange column [carboxymethyl (CM)-Toyopearl 250S] were then carried out. The purified cytochrome was dialyzed against a solution containing the crystallization buffer (see below). The protein was concentrated as needed by centrifuging in Centricon 10 (Amicon) tubes. The concentration

of cytochrome was determined spectroscopically using an extinction coefficient esso = 30.8 m M I cm 1 for the reduced form of the protein (Bartsch, 1978). The purity of the cytochrome was determined from the ratio of its absorbance at 280 nm to that at 417 nm (Bartsch, 1978). Solutions with ratios less than 0.25 were used for crystallization. The absence of protein contaminants was verified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 15% polyacrylamide gels.

Crystallization

The crystallization of cytochrome c2 was accomplished by the hanging-drop technique (McPherson, 1982). The crystallization protocols for the three different crystal forms were as follows. (1) Hexagonal co'stallization. 10 Ix1 droplets containing cytochrome c2 at a concentration of 10 mg ml-1, 100 m M imidazole (pH 7.0) and 30% saturated ( N H 4 ) 2 S O 4 w e r e equilibrated against l ml reservoirs containing 70% saturated (NH4)2SO4 in 100 m M imidazole (pH 7.0). Crystals were observed within one week at a thermostatically controlled temperature of 4 :C; they reached a length of 1.5 mm within three weeks. This crystal form has been previously reported by Allen (1988). (2) Triclinic co,stallization. 10 Ixl droplets containing 10 mg m l - l cytochrome c2, 10 m M HEPES (N-2hydroxyethyl-piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 7.0) and 5%(w/v) PEG (polyethylene glycol) 4000 (EM Science) were equilibrated against l ml reservoirs containing an unbuffered solution of 20%(w/v) PEG 4000. Crystals were observed at ambient (22 =C) temperature after three weeks. (3) Tetragonal co'stallization. 10 ~1 droplets containing 15 mg ml-~ cytochrome c2, 50 m M MES [2(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid] (pH6.0) and 5%(w/v) PEG 4000 were equilibrated against l ml reservoirs containing 50mM MES (pH 6.0), * TE buffer= 10 mM T R I S [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane], 1 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), pH 8.0. 20%(w/v) PEG 4000 and 0.6 M NaC1.

Phasing and rq~'nement
X-ray diffraction data were collected from all three crystal forms. The primary phasing necessary for the calculation of initial electron-density maps was first accomplished for the hexagonal crystal form. The derivatized form used for the phase determination was obtained by soaking the crystals for 14d at 22 C in a 90% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 100mM imidazole (pH 7.0), 40 m M trimethyllead acetate (Holden & Rayment, 1991) solution. (I) Hexagonal crystal Jorm. From X-ray diffraction data of the native and trimethyllead acetate derivative, isomorphous-difference Patterson and anomalous-difference Patterson maps were calculated with the program ROCKS (Reeke, 1984). From these, the lead sites were located, the phasing information was obtained, and an electron-density map was calculated. From the electron density, a tracing of the overall fold of the polypeptide backbone as well as the placement of the heme porphyrin ring was obtained. Model building, using the known amino-acid sequence of Rb. sphaeroides cytochrome c2 (Ambler et al., 1979) was performed on an Evans and Sutherland PS330 computer graphics terminal with the interactive molecular modeling program FRODO (Jones, 1985). Least-squares refinement of the starting model was performed with the program TNT (Tronrud, TenEyck & Matthews, 1987). Further rounds of coordinate and B-factor refinements were performed after rebuilding the model against 2 F o b s -F~,,~ and Fob.,- F~lc electron-density maps. Simulated-annealing refinement with the program X-PLOR (Brfinger, Kuriyan & Karplus, 1987) was used as the last refinement step. The R factor* for the current model, including 52 water molecules, is 17.0% using all observed X-ray diffraction data within the resolution range 6.0-2.2 A (r.m.s. deviations from ideal bond lengths = 0.010/k and bond angles = 1.9). (2) Triclinic crystal form. The coordinates of the cytochrome c2 in the hexagonal space group were used as a molecular-replacement model to determine the structure of the cytochrome at higher resolution in the triclinic space group. Molecular-replacement calculations were carried out with the integrated software package MERLOT (Fitzgerald, 1988) and a translation function program GENTF (D. Rees, unpublished). These calculations established that both cytochrome c2 molecules within the triclinic

unit cell were situated in similar orientations, and that the triclinic crystal form of the cytochrome c2 from Rb. sphaeroides is pseudo-body centered. The molecular replacement solution was refined by rigidbody refinement using TNT, followed by refinement with X-PLOR leading to an R factor, including 204 water molecules, of 17.3% (r.m.s. bond-length deviation = 0.010 A and r.m.s, bond-angle deviation = 1.9~). (3) Tetragonal crystal form. The coordinates of the cytochrome in the triclinic space group, refined to a resolution of 1.95 A, were used to determine the structure of the cytochrome in the tetragonal space group at a resolution of 1.6 .~. Rotation and translation functions were calculated within the resolution range 8-3 .~ with the MERLOT program. The translation function indicated that these crystals of the cytochrome belong to space group P4~2,2. Refinement of the tetragonal model at a resolution of 1.6 A was performed with the program TNT and X-PLOR, as described for the hexagonal and triclinic forms. The current R factor, including 25 water molecules is 22.5% (r.m.s. bond-length deviation = 0.010 A and r.m.s, bond-angle deviation = 1.8 ~).
Results and discussion

The three different crystal forms of cytochrome c2 from Rb. sphaeroides are shown in Fig. 1. At high ionic strength, crystals belonging to the hexagonal crystal system (Fig. la) were obtained, while at low ionic strength, both triclinic (Fig. l b) as well as tetragonal crystals (Fig. 1¢) formed. The crystal parameters are summarized in Table 1. The Matthews number, Vm (Matthews, 1968) of the hexagonal form is the largest, implying that this form has the highest solvent content. This high solvent content may account for the diminished resolution of the hexagonal form (2.2A) as compared to the triclinic (2.0A) and tetragonal (1.5 A) forms (see Table 2). The packing motif in the crystal forms is different. In the triclinic form, which is pseudo-body centered, subunit interactions exist between pseudo-translational symmetry-related cytochromes in identical

Most of these lattice contacts in the triclinic form are hydrogen bonds between residues located on surface loops of the protein. In contrast, in the tetragonal form, contacts between subunits in identical orientations do not exist, and most of the contacts are between the N-terminal region of one cytochrome and the C-terminal region of a symmetry-related subunit. Packing differences between the triclinic and tetragonal forms may be influenced by pH. Crystallization of the cytochrome in the tetragonal form at pH 6.0 occurs at a value closer to the reported pI of 5.5 (Meyer, 1970). In the tctragonal form, the side chain of Glu2 (near the N terminus) on the cytochrome makes electrostatic contact with the side chain of H i s l l l (near the C terminus) on a symmetry-related molecule. In the triclinic form, crystallized at pH 7.0, His l l l with an expected pK, of - 6 . 0 is less likely to form packing interactions. In the hexagonal crystal, the binding of imidazole (from the crystallization buffer) is believed to influence packing (see later discussion). For example, the displaced side chain of Met l00 is within van der Waals contact of P h e l 0 2 on a symmetryrelated subunit. X-ray diffraction data were collected from native crystals of the three forms, and from the trimethyllead acetate derivative of the hexagonal form (Table 2). The resulting difference Patterson m a p calculated for the hexagonal crystal derivative indicated one major trimethyllead acetate binding site. The coordinates of the identified major lead binding site were refined utilizing the program H E A V Y (Terwilliger & Eisenberg, 1983). Two additional minor sites were located in difference F o u r i e r maps. Further refinement of coordinate, occupancy and isotropic temperature factor for the three lead sites, resulted in single isomorphous replacement anomalous-scattering (SIRAS) phases at 3.0 A resolution with an overall figure of merit* of 0.77 and a phasing p o w e r t * The figure of merit is the mean value of the cosine of the error in the phase angle. f Phasing power =.[),/Ewherejj, is the root-mean-square heavyatom structure-factor amplitude and E is the root-mean-square lack-of-closure error. of 3.33. Based on these lead derivative ~hases, electron-density maps at a resolution of 3 ~, were calculated in both the P6,22 and the P6522 space groups. The boundaries of the protein subunits and the prosthetic heme group could be observed only in the electron-density maps calculated in the P6,22 enantiomorph. These maps were used for the initial model building which was then subjected to several refinement cycles, leading to an R factor of 17.0%. The model of the Rb. sphaeroides cytochrome c2 in the hexagonal space group is shown in Fig. 2. The model has the following secondary-structure elements; five a-helices, eight surface loops, an antiparallel /3-loop, and a short stretch of anti-parallel /3-sheet (Fig. 2); at the N terminus, amino-acid residues 5-17 form a distorted a-helix. Another stretch of a-helix exists toward the C-terminal end of the cytochrome between G l u l 0 7 and Gln l 19. These Nand C-terminal a-helices are spatially in close

Both the Rb. sphaeroides and Rb. capsulatus cytochromes contain the /j-loop between amino acids 20 and 30 (Rb. sphaeroides numbering). In the cytochrome c2 from R. rubrum, this/J-loop is absent. The hexagonal structure was used as the molecular replacement model to solve the triclinic and tetragonal crystal structures. The structures obtained were similar to that of the hexagonal structure with a root-mean-square overlap of 0.6 A between corresponding C " positions (not shown). The major difference observed was in the ligands of the heine prosthetic group (Fig. 3). In the triclinic and tetragonal crystal forms, the iron atom is coordinated at the axial ligand positions to the S atom of Metl00 and the imidazole N atom of Hisl9 (Fig. 3a). Such coordination of an invariant histidine residue and an invariant methionine residue to the heme iron is found in all class I c-type cytochromes (reviewed in Moore & Pettigrew, 1990, ch. 4). In the hexagonal crystal form, a discontinuity of the electron density between the heme Fe atom and the Met l00 side chain was observed in the initial SIRAS maps and throughout the refinement process. This indicates a larger distance between the S atom of Met l00 and the heme iron in the hexagonal form, i.e. 5.7 versus 2.3 A found in the triclinic and tetragonal structures. When the maps of the hexagonal crystal form were closely inspected, the existence of electron density that fits the geometry of a five-membered ring was observed (Fig. 3b). An imidazole molecule (from the crystallization buffer) (labeled in green in Fig. 3h) was positioned into this density, and a distance of 2.0 ~ between the imidazole N atom and the Fe atom of the heme was determined. In addition, a bound water molecule (not shown), unique to the hexagonal form, was detected in the vicinity of the imidazole molecule. This water molecule can form hydrogen-bond interactions with the protein backbone and the imidazole that may further stabilize the binding of imidazole. The structural evidence provided here for the binding of imidazole to the heme Fe atom and the displacement of the Met axial ligand of the cytochrome c2 of Rb. ~sphaeroides, confirms previous findings in other systems. Schejter & George (1964) were the first to report the reaction between horse ferricytochrome c and imidazole. This interaction was characterized in a kinetic study by Sutin & Yandell (1972). The crystallographic structure is also in good agreement with the findings in the photosynthetic bacterium Rb. capsulatus where kinetic measurements indicated the binding of imidazole to cytochrome c2 in solution (Hazzard, Caffrey, Myer & Cusanovich, 1992).

601

From the optical absorption spectrum of solubilized P6.22 hexagonal crystals, we determined that the cytochrome was in its oxidized (Fe 3+) form. This is in agreement with the findings of Schejter & Aviram (1969) who found a preferential binding of imidazole to the cytochrome in the Fe 3~ oxidation state of the heine iron. When the hexagonal crystals of cytochrome e2 were soaked in low concentrations of sodium ascorbate (a reducing agent), the crystals remain physically intact but lose the capacity to diffract X-rays. Furthermore, growth of hexagonal crystals in the presence of imidazole from reduced (Fe 2÷) protein occurred very slowly, over a period of 2-3 weeks, during which time the oxidation of the Fe 2' probably occurred. In contrast, growth of hexagonal crystals from oxidized (Fe 3~ ) protein, prepared under the same conditions, occurred overnight. These findings indicate that redox-dependent ligand binding can alter the crystallization properties and the quality of diffraction of the resulting crystals. Ligand substitution of buffers like imidazole may be of importance in the crystallization as well as the function of other metalloproteins.* We thank Tim Donohue for providing the cytochrome c2 overproducing strain, Hazel Holden for providing trimethyllead acetate used in the heavyatom soaks and N.-H.
