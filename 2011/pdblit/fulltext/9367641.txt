Keywords: Rhenium oxocomplexes; 3,5-Dimethylpyrazole; X-ray structure; Electronic structure

Pyrazole and its derivatives possess two adjacent nucleophilic sites and their steric and electronic properties can be modified by the substituents of the heterocyclic ring. They (i) can act as monodentate, exo- or even endo-bidentate anionic ligands, (ii) can afford oligomers of different nuclearities depending on the used synthesis methods and (iii) have been shown to possess a rather wide conformational variability [1,2]. During the last decade the preparations, structures and properties of dinuclear and polynuclear oxo complexes have attracted much attention since these species can produce specific structures, properties and reactivities, which are not common for mononuclear complexes. These compounds are very important from the standpoint of catalysis, biological mimicry, multi electron-transfer reactions and metal­metal interactions [3­6].

Treatment of the [ReOX3(AsPh3)(OAsPh3)] (X = Cl or Br) complexes with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole (3,5-Me2pzH) in acetone at room temperature leads to the [{Re(O)X2(3, 5-Me2pzH)2}2(l-O)] complexes with a nearly linear O@Re OARe@O moiety and four monodentate 3,5-dimethylpyrazole ligands. The symmetrically substituted dinuclear rhenium complexes [{Re(O)X(PPh3)}2(l-O)(l-3,5-Me2 pz)2] with a bent O@ReAOARe@O moiety and two bridging 3,5-Me2pzÀ ligands were isolated in the reactions of [ReOX3(PPh3)2] with 3,5-Me2pzH in acetone at room temperature, whereas refluxing of [ReO(OEt)X2(PPh3)2] with 3,5-Me2pzH in ethanol leads to unsymmetrically substituted dinuclear rhenium [{Re(O)X(PPh3)}(l-O)(l-3,5-Me2 pz)2{Re(O)X(3,5-Me2pzH)}] complexes [7]. This work forms part of our studies on the reactivity of [ReOX3L2] towards 3,5-dimethylpyrazole. Here, we report the synthesis, spectroscopic investigation, crystal and molecular structure for the [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2 pzH)4}] complex. The [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] compound has been isolated in the reaction of [ReOCl3(PPh3)2] [8]

with 3,5-dimethylpyrazole [9] in acidified acetone at room temperature [10]. The reaction was carried out in a system open to the atmosphere, and formation of the l-oxo dinuclear complexes doubtlessly involves water and intermediate hydroxo-species. A water elimination reaction between two hydroxo complexes affording the oxygen bridged dinuclear species has been proposed and accepted and probably represents an alternative route to the direct deprotonation of a hydroxo intermediate affording the O@Re@O unit. Factors determining the formation and stabilisation of l-oxo dinuclear complexes as well as the conversion of the dinuclear complex to the mononuclear dioxo complex have not yet been investigated systematically and are dependent on reaction conditions. The elemental analysis of the complex is in good agreement with its formulation. The infrared spectrum confirms the presence of the terminal and bridging oxo ligands and 3,5Me2pzH in the coordination sphere. A sharp band at 971 cmÀ1 is assignable to the symmetric Re@O stretch, and a strong multicomponent band centered at 718 cmÀ1 with the same shape illustrated in the article of [11] results from overlapping of the antisymmetric Re­O­Re stretching modes with the aromatic ring out-of-plane deformation vibrations. The m(Re@O) and mas(Re­O­Re) observed for [{ReOCl4} (l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] agree well with appropriate values found previously in similar dirhenium oxocompounds [7]. The electron-withdrawing effect of the terminal Re@O group in the complexes with the O@ ReAOARe@O framework results in a relative weakening of the bridging Re­Ob bonds and leads to the reduction in the frequency of m(Re­ O­Re) stretching mode in comparison with [Re2OCl10]4À. The antisymmetric m(Re­O­Re) stretching mode of the last one occurs as a strong band at 850­855 cmÀ1[12]. The strong bands in the range 3200­3100 cmÀ1 assignable to N­H vibrations indicate the coordination of the pyrazole ligands in the neutral monodentate form [13]. Such coordination of the 3,5-dimethylpyrazole molecules is also supported by 1H NMR studies; the singlet at 11.58 ppm corresponds to NH protons. The lack of paramagnetic broadening or shifts of resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO (3,5-Me2pzH)4}] confirms diamagnetism of the complex. A definite proof for the structure is provided by the Xray diffraction results [14]. The [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3, 5-Me2pzH)4}] complex takes a dinuclear structure in which two rhenium atoms are bridged by the oxo ligand (Fig. 1). The rhenium and oxygen (terminal and bridging) atoms occupy special positions a of I4 (No. 79) space group at 0, 0, z [15]. This forces the molecule to occupy four asymmetric units. The molecules are linked via a weak intermolecular hydrogen bond: C(2)­H(2)Á Á ÁO(3)#(xÀ0.5, yÀ0.5, ° zÀ0.5) (DÁ Á ÁA distance 3.443(5) A and D­HÁ Á ÁA angle 164.7°. The intramolecular hydrogen bond linking N(2)­ ° H(2)Á Á ÁCl(1) (DÁ Á ÁA distance 3.226(3) A and D­HÁ Á ÁA angle 163.0° provides additional stabilisation of the [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] molecule [16,17]. Each rhenium ion of [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5Me2pzH)4}] is in a distorted octahedral geometry. The

equatorial plane of the Re(1) center is occupied by four 3,5-Me2pzH molecules, whereas the equatorial plane of the Re(2) atom consists of four chloride ligands. The axial positions of Re(1) and Re(2) centers are occupied by terminal (Ot) and bridging (Ob) oxo ligands. Because of the crystallographic symmetry the O@ReAOARe@O core is perfect linear. ° Both Re­Ot bond lengths fall in the range 1.639­1.76 A [18], typical of mononuclear complexes of rhenium(V) having the [ReO]3+ core and suggest a considerable degree of multiple bond character due to Ot ! Rep bonding. However, the bond between the terminal oxo ligand and the Re ion with four 3,5-Me2pzH molecules is considerably ° longer (by 0.042 A) than the Re(2)­Ot distance, and it is ° compared with the values (1.723(7) and 1.716(6) A) found for cis-[ReO2(Hdab)(py)2] [19]. Significant differences are also observed for the Re­Ob bond lengths. The Re(2)­Ob distance corresponds to an ideal single Re­O bond distance ° (2.04 A), predicted by the use of Pauling's oxygen covalent radius and Cotton and Lippard's value for the Re(V) octahedral covalent radius [20]. The Re(1)­Ob is considerably ° shorter (by 0.189 A) in comparison with the Re(2)­Ob distance. On the other hand, it is longer than those observed ° in [ReO2L4]+ complexes: 1.769(1) and 1.761 A for + ° for [ReO2(cyclam)]+[22] and [ReO2(en)2] [21], 1.775(9) A ° 1.765(3) A for [ReO2(2-MeImH)4]+ [23]. This indicates

some redistribution of the dp­pp interaction along the Ot­Re­Ob unit. The Re­N and Re­Cl bond lengths of [{ReOCl4}(l-O) {ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] are unexceptional, they agree well with appropriate values found previously in similar rhenium compounds [7,24]. A mixed oxidation state formulation involving Re(III) and Re(VII) centers could be proposed for the unsymmetrical [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] complex. However, Re(VII) is generally found in complexes including the {ReO3} moiety and Re(III) coordination compounds are not normally associated with a terminal oxo ligand [25]. It seems that the [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] complex can be best formulated as the [ReVOCl4][ReVO2(3,5-Me2pzH)4] adduct. Such the formulation is supported by the general features of coordination rhenium compounds and is in accordance with the diamagnetic properties of [{ReOCl4}(l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}]. Each rhenium atom uses six valence orbitals, 5dx2 Ày 2 ; 5dz2 , 6s, 6px, 6py and 6pz to form r-bonds with the six ligands, the occupied 5dxy orbitals of the both rhenium ions remain nonbonding, and empty 5dyz and 5dxz orbitals interact with the filled 2px and 2py orbitals of the terminal and bridging oxo ligands to give four p-bonding, two p-nonbonding and four p-antibonding molecular orbitals. In total, there are four r and four p bonding orbitals describing Re2O3 unit. The experimental electronic spectrum of [{ReOCl4} (l-O){ReO(3,5-Me2pzH)4}] is presented in Fig. 2. Two longest wavelength experimental bands are attributed to the transitions of d ! d character. The absorption band with maximum at $300 nm can be assigned to the LMCT transitions occurring from the chloride and oxo ligands to the d

orbitals of the rhenium centers. The intense and broad experimental band at $250 nm can be mainly attributed to the transitions of MLCT character occurring from the rhenium centers to the p-antibonding orbitals of the pyrazole ligands.
