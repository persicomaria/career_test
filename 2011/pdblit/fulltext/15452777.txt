Abstract Toluene 4-monooxygenase, a four-protein complex from Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, catalyzes the NADH- and O2-dependent hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol. The solution structure of the 112-aminoacid Rieske ferredoxin component, T4moC, was determined from 2D and 3D 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR data. The structural model was refined through simulated annealing by molecular dynamics in torsion angle space with input from 1650 experimental restraints, including 1264 inter-proton distance restraints obtained from NOEs, 247 non-redundant intra-residue NOEs, 26 hydrogen bond restraints, and 113 dihedral angle (/, w) restraints. The 20 calculated conformers that best satisfied the input restraints were submitted to refinement in explicit solvent to improve the stereochemical quality. With exclusion of illdefined N- and C-terminal segments (Ser2; His111≠ Ser112) and residues near to the [2Fe-2S] cluster, the atomic root mean square deviation for the 20 conformers ∞ with respect to the mean coordinates was 1.09 A for the ∞ for all non-hydrogen atoms.

T4moC structure consists of 10 b-strands arranged in the three anti-parallel b-sheet topology observed in all Rieske [2Fe-2S] domain proteins. The Sc of Cys45 and Cys64 and the Nd1 of His47 and His67 provide the ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster of T4moC. 1H≠15N HSQC measurements show that both His47-N2 and His67-N2 are protonated at the pH of the NMR experiments. Comparisons are made between the present NMR structure, previous paramagnetic NMR studies of T4moC, and the X-ray structures of other members of the Rieske protein family.

Introduction
Rieske ferredoxins are found as domains or subunits of membrane oxidase complexes [1, 2], cis-dihydrodiolforming aromatic dioxygenases [3, 4], bacterial assimilatory nitrite reductases [5], and arsenite oxidase [6]. Rieske ferredoxins are also found as soluble electron carriers in bacterial dioxygenases and monooxygenase complexes [4, 7, 8]. The specific functions of additional examples identified by genome sequencing efforts have not yet been determined. X-ray crystal structures have been determined for the Rieske [2Fe-2S] domains from the avian, bovine, and yeast bc1 [9, 10, 11], plant b6f [12], and archaebacterial SoxF [13] oxidase complexes, Thermus thermophilus [14], naphthalene dioxygenase [15], arsenite oxidase [6], and the soluble electron carrier ferredoxin of the Burkholderia species strain LB400 biphenyl dioxygenase [16]. These structures reveal a conserved fold topology primarily composed of a b-sheet and a similar geometry of Cys and His ligands to the iron-sulfur center. The present work focuses on the soluble electron carrier of the toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) from

Pseudomonas mendocina KR1. This bacterial enzyme complex [17] consists of an NADH oxidoreductase (T4moF), a diiron hydroxylase (T4moH, (abc)2 quaternary structure [18]), a catalytic effector protein (T4moD, [19]), and the Rieske ferredoxin (T4moC, [18]). T4moC acts as an obligate electron carrier between T4moF and T4moH [18]. We previously used paramagnetic NMR to study uniform and amino acid selectively labeled samples of T4moC in order to investigate amino acids potentially contributing to the cluster binding region [20]. The NMR studies of T4moC revealed 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N resonances that we assigned to atoms of the cluster ligands Cys45, His47, Cys64, and His67. In addition, paramagnetically shifted 15N resonances, observed in samples prepared with 15N-amino acid selective labeling, led to the proposal that residues Gln48 and Ala66 might also be involved in close interactions with the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Here we report the solution structure of T4moC in the oxidized state as determined by simulated annealing with the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA [21]. The structure was refined by the structure calculation program XPLOR-NIH [22]. This structure provides an opportunity to correlate the previous paramagnetic NMR results with a solution structure of T4moC and to examine the relationship between the NMR and X-ray structures of Rieske proteins.

combination of x- and z-gradients at the ``magic angle'' [26, 27] were used for coherence selection and sensitivity enhancement, which resulted in improved suppression of the water solvent signal in all 3D NMR experiments. Sequence-specific assignments of the polypeptide backbone resonances were made from 1H≠15N HSQC, HNCA, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA spectra, while assignments of the side-chain resonances were made from CCONH, HNCACB, HCCONH, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. The raw NMR data were processed with FELIX95 (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, Calif.). In most cases, the indirectly detected dimensions were extended by linear prediction. Typically, a 90∞-shifted squared sine-bell window function was applied to each FID, zero-filled, Fourier transformed, and phase corrected. All 1H dimensions were referenced to internal 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate (DSS), and 13C and 15 N were indirectly referenced to DSS. Atom-naming conventions used are based on IUPAC recommendations [28]. Calculation of [2Fe-2S] cluster core The geometry of the [2Fe-2S] core was calculated from a bis(l-sulfido)diiron(III) model having two methanethiol ligands to one iron atom and two imidazole ligands to the other iron atom. The cluster geometry was optimized with the Jaguar ab initio electronic structure package (Schrodinger, Portland, Ore.). The optimization was performed at the BP86 density functional level of theory and the Jaguar LACVP** basis set. This basis set uses an effective core potential for the Fe atoms with valence orbitals represented with the 6-31G** basis set and with all other atoms in the model represented with 6-31G**. The xyz coordinates derived from this calculation are shown in Table S1 of the Supplementary material. For the CYANA structure calculations, a Cys-Sc-FeS definition (CYF) was adopted from previous work [29], while a His-Nd1-Fe-S- definition (HIF) was constructed in an analogous manner. These two new residue type definitions were included in the CYANA amber_hif.lib file with bond distances as determined from the calculated core geometry. The topology and parameterization of the cluster for the water refinement [30] in XPLOR-NIH [22] was taken from the ab initio structure. Equivalent parameters for bonds lengths and angles were averaged from the values observed in the ab initio structure where appropriate, and planarity was enforced using idealized geometry. Close contacts between hydrogen atoms were prevented by explicit terms in the force field (M. Nilges, personal communication). Structural restraints Inter-proton distance restraints were derived from NOEs assigned in 3D 15N-edited NOESY (mixing times

Materials and methods
Sample preparation [U-15N]- and [U-13C,U-15N]-labeled T4moC were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) grown on a minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope, Andover, Mass.) and [U-13C]-D-glucose (Isotec, Miamisburg, Ohio) as appropriate [20, 23]. ESI-MS characterization of isotopic incorporation was performed at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. Samples used for NMR data collection contained 1≠2 mM of [U-15N]- or [U-13C,U-15N]-T4moC or 3.0 mM natural abundance T4moC. Before NMR experiments, T4moC was exchanged into 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.4; 90:10 v/v H2O/D2O or 99.9% D2O) by gel filtration and placed in a sealed NMR tube in an N2-atmosphere glove box. NMR spectroscopy and data processing All NMR experiments were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker DMX-600 spectrometer equipped with a tripleresonance 1H, 13C, and 15N probe and three-axis pulsed field gradients (http://www.nmrfam.wisc.edu). Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained with the TPPI method [24] for homonuclear 2D experiments, or with the States-TPPI methods [25] for heteronuclear experiments.

of 80 and 150 ms) for amide protons, and 3D 13C-edited NOESY (mixing time of 100 ms) data for aliphatic protons. NOE peak intensities were converted into upper distance bounds with the CALIBA function of CYANA. Prior to structure calculation, the redundant intra-residual NOEs were filtered out [31]. Hydrogen bond restraints were identified from the pattern of sequential and inter-strand NOEs involving HN and Ha protons. Assigned 1Ha, 13Ca, 13Cb, 13Cc, and 15N chemical shifts were used as input to the TALOS [32] software package, which generated a total of 113 / and w dihedral angle restraints. Structure calculations The CANDID module [21] of CYANA [33] was used to automatically generate an initial model for the structure. This was refined iteratively using the simulated annealing protocol (20,000 total steps) of the torsion angle dynamics program CYANA (version 1.0.6 [26]). Of the final 100 structures calculated, 20 conformers with the lowest target function values were selected for refinement in water [30] using XPLOR-NIH [22]. A Brooks ∞ water box of length 18.856 A was used repetitively to generate multiple layers of water around the protein up ∞ to 8 A away from the heavy atoms of the protein. This resulted in approximately 900 water molecules coordinating the polypeptide. The individual conformer with the lowest backbone r.m.s. deviation from the mean structure was selected to be the representative structure. Secondary structure evaluations were performed using the protein Secondary Structure Matching algorithm provided at the European Bioinformatics Institute [34]. The pair_fit routine (PyMOL version 0.93, DeLano Scientific, Castro City, Calif.) was used to perform alignments of the T4moC structure with other Rieske proteins.

the [2Fe-2S] center. In an anaerobic buffer at pH 6.4, NMR samples of oxidized T4moC were stable at 298 K for $4 days. Consequently, several samples were required to complete the studies reported here.

Results
Status of NMR samples The gene for T4moC encodes 112 amino acids, including one Arg, four Asn, two Gln, two Trp, and four Pro residues [35]. T4moC was expressed from a pET-15 plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). In a typical 4-L fermentation, $20 g of wet cells were obtained and $10≠25 mg of purified T4moC was recovered after a two-step purification [18]. An ESI-MS analysis of the [U-13C,U-15N]-enriched NMR samples revealed >98% enrichment by the fed-batch labeling method [23], closely matching the isotopic content of the precursors used for bacterial growth. The mass analyses also revealed that the N-terminal Met residue was completely removed. Thus 121 1H≠15N cross peaks and 1446 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances were expected from the mature protein in the absence of hyperfine broadening caused by

Sequence-specific assignments of the polypeptide backbone resonances were determined from 1H≠15N HSQC, HNCA, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, and HNCACB spectra by matching intra- and inter-residue 13Ca and/or 13Cb chemical shifts for a given residue (associated with a 1 H≠15N correlation peak) and the previous residue in the primary sequence. Table S2 of the Supplementary material contains pertinent experimental details. Figure 1 shows the 1H≠15N HSCQ spectrum of T4moC obtained at pH 6.4 and 298 K. An analysis of this spectrum led to the assignment of 116 1H≠15N cross peaks. Previous paramagnetic NMR studies showed that Cys45, His47, Gln48, Cys64, Ala66, and His67 contain backbone atoms whose resonances are hyperfine shifted [20]; these residues account for the majority of unassigned signals from the protein backbone. Of the 551 expected backbone resonances, 518 signals were observed and assigned ($94% complete). Additional backbone atoms that were not assigned to NMR resonances included the 15N, 1HN, 13C, 13Ca, and Ha of Ser2, Met44, Glu49, Ile50, Leu51, Arg65, Leu68, and Trp69, and the 15N of Pro46, Pro90, and Pro107. Resonances from other nuclei in these residues were not detected in the 2D or 3D experiments. Side-chain resonances of Pro81 were observed only weakly, and the 13Cd and 1Hd were not detected, possibly due to paramagnetic broadening. In addition, the carbonyl carbon resonances of Asn80, Trp89, and Leu106 were not determined in these NMR data sets because the following residue in each case is proline. Side-chain resonances were determined from analysis of C(CO)NH, HNCACB, HC(CO)NH, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY data. Assignments for the sidechains of the four Asn and two Gln residues were confirmed by results from the HNCACB experiment with the delay values optimized for amide NH2 groups. The ring resonances of the tyrosines (four), phenylalanines (three), and histidines (the three not ligated to the [2Fe2S] center) were assigned by analyzing 2D 1H NOESY and TOCSY in D2O, CT-13C-HSQC, and 3D NOESYCT-HSQC and TOCSY-CT-HSQC data. Secondary structure Qualitative analysis of the short-, medium-, and longrange NOEs served to identify secondary structural elements of T4moC. The TALOS algorithm was used to search a database of correlations between polypeptide conformation and chemical shift as an aid to secondary structure assignment [32].

Two three-stranded anti-parallel b-sheets (Phe3≠ Leu9, Pro90≠Gly95, and Asp96≠Ser101; Glu16≠Thr22, Thr26≠Asn32, and Gly37≠Ala43) and one four-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet (Ser56≠Glu58, Val61≠Thr63, Thr70≠Gly74, and Gly76≠Ile79) were identified. Tertiary structure calculation A total of 1650 inter-proton distance restraints were used in the structure calculations. These comprised 247 non-redundant intra-residual, 437 sequential (|j¿i|=1), 251 medium-range (1<|j¿i|<5), and 861 long-range NOE distance restraints. The calculation also included 26 hydrogen bond and 113 dihedral angle restraints. Figure 2A shows the correlations between the number of NOE restraints and the sequential separation between residues, while Fig. 2B shows the number of NOE restraints assigned to each residue of the protein. The lack of NOE restraints for residues Cys45≠Leu51 and Cys64≠Trp69 corresponds to regions of the protein anticipated to experience hyperfine broadening from the [2Fe-2S] center [20]. In other regions of the structure, the average number of NOE restraints per residue was 17.5. The structure was refined by simulated annealing and by molecular dynamics in torsion

angle space with CYANA, and statistics obtained at this first stage of the structure calculation are shown in Table 1. The 20 best conformers obtained from the CYANA calculation were submitted to a refinement in explicit solvent by XPLOR-NIH [30] to improve the stereochemical quality. Table 1 shows the structural statistics from this additional refinement. With exclusion of ill-defined N- and C-terminal segments (Ser2; His111≠ Ser112) and residues near to the [2Fe-2S] cluster, the atomic r.m.s. deviation for the 20 conformers with ∞ respect to the mean coordinates was 1.09 A for the ∞ backbone and 1.60 A for all non-hydrogen atoms. The average results for the 20 best conformers are presented in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot for the 20 conformers showed 82% of the / and w angle combinations to be in the most favored regions, 13% in the additional allowed regions, 3% in generously allowed regions, and 2% in the disallowed region. Figure 2C shows the percentage completeness of observed NOEs relative to those expected for each residue. The ∞ completeness of inter-residue NOEs up to 4 A for the residues away from the cluster after refinement in CNS is 70%, which is significantly higher than the average of 48% observed for a large set of protein structures determined by NMR methods [36].

Data deposition The coordinates obtained from the refinement with XPLOR-NIH have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession number 1SJG. Model 1 of the ensemble is designated as the representative structure. 1 H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments, chemical shifts, and individual residue displacement statistics have been deposited with the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (accession no. 4992). Examination of structure Figure 3 shows a ribbon diagram of the NMR structure of T4moC. The 10 b-strands have connectivity similar to that observed in all other structurally characterized Rieske [2Fe-2S] domains. The N-terminal subdomain is a barrel-like structure composed of two b-sheets, while the [2Fe-2S] cluster-binding subdomain is composed of a loop and the third b-sheet. In T4moC, the first b-sheet consists of three strands: b1 (Phe3≠Leu9), b10 (Asp96≠ Ser101), and b9 (Pro90≠Gly95), while the second bsheet also consists of three strands: b2 (Glu16≠Thr22), b3 (Thr26≠Glu34), and b4 (Gly37≠Ala43). Strands b2 and b3 exhibit 13 inter-strand NOEs and six inter-strand hydrogen bonds, while strands b3 and b4 exhibit 12 inter-strand NOEs and six inter-strand hydrogen bonds. The sequence between strands b4 and b5 forms an extended loop containing Cys45 and His47, two of the ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster. The third b-sheet consists of four strands: b5 (Ser56≠Gly59), b6 (Gly60≠Thr63), b7 (Thr70≠Gly74), and b8 (Thr75≠Ile79). Strand b5, the first strand of the third sheet, is connected to b6 by a bturn, as are b7 and b8. A short loop between b6 and b7 contains Cys64 and His67, the other pair of ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster. Pro81, which adopts a cis configuration as observed in all other Rieske [2Fe-2S] domain structures having a proline residue in this position, lies in an extended loop that connects strands b8 and b9. A bhairpin connects b9 to b10. Strands b9 and b10 exhibit 10 inter-strand NOEs and four inter-strand hydrogen bonds. Strand b10 is in close contact with strand b1, as evidenced by 11 inter-strand NOEs and three interstrand hydrogen bonds. The carboxyl terminal of the energy-minimized protein adopts an extended configuration. In our previous NMR work [20], the N2 resonances of His47 and His64 were assigned from study of [15N2]His-labeled T4moC. Thus, in the oxidized state at 293 K, two resonances were observed at 233.8 ppm and 231.5 ppm. Upon reduction, these two resonances shifted to 119.7 and 116.3 ppm. Figure 4 shows a portion of the 1H≠15N HSQC spectrum of oxidized T4moC, with two crosspeaks having nitrogen frequencies of $233 ppm and proton frequencies of $7.2 and $7.7 ppm. The presence of these crosspeaks, whose nitrogen frequencies correlate with the previous assignments made from amino acid selective labeling

experiments with the oxidized protein, indicates that the non-bonded N2 position of both His ligands in T4moC are protonated at the pH of the NMR experiments. Moreover, the observed nitrogen chemical shifts provide experimental confirmation that the [2Fe-2S] cluster was oxidized in the samples used for the structure determination.

Discussion
Approach used to solve the NMR structure The structure reported here arises from a combination of methodologies: ab initio calculation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster core geometry, solution of the NMR structure by standard chain connectivity and NOE approaches, and refinement of the structure in explicit solvent by XPLOR-NIH [30]. This multi-step process was taken in part because paramagnetic broadening prevented the observation of NOEs from proton pair structures near the [2Fe-2S] cluster.

It has been shown that a final refinement employing energy parameters with completely revised dihedral angle terms in a thin layer of explicit water molecules will yield structure models that have a higher quality as measured by all available geometric quantities, while maintaining the same level of agreement with the experimental data [30, 37]. In the recalculation of more than 500 NMR structures of proteins deposited in the PDB (A.J. Nederveen and J.F. Doreleijers, unpublished work), this refinement step led to an average 7% improvement in the percentage of residues in the most favored Ramachandran regions as calculated by PROCHECK_NMR [38]. In the case of the T4moC structure, an improvement fromo 77 to 82% was observed ® subsequent to this refinement step (Table 1). Structure alignments The Secondary Structure Matching algorithm [34] of the Macromolecular Structure Database was used to align the T4moC secondary structure with those of the

from chicken heart mitochondrial bc1 complex (1BCC:E, Q=0.16), and SoxF from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (1JML:A, Q=0.16). These secondary structure alignments indicated that T4moC was most similar to BphF [16]. This assessment was also consistent with the similar function of these two proteins as intermediate electron carriers for multiprotein oxygenase complexes. Optimal alignment of the backbone atoms of T4moC with the backbone atoms of BphF had an r.m.s. devia∞ tion of $3 A. The lower subdomain consisting of the first and second b-sheets was well matched. In contrast, alignment of the upper subdomain containing the [2Fe2S] cluster and conserved Pro-containing loop of the two homologs exhibited substantial differences (data not shown). In the present NMR structure of T4moC, it is noted that the distance between the [2Fe-2S] cluster and ∞ conserved Pro81 is $11 A, while the corresponding ∞ distance in BphF is $4 A. Moreover, the orientation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster relative to the conserved lower subdomain is rotated $90∞. These differences could simply arise from the lack of experimental NOE restraints between the residues near to the T4moC [2Fe2S] cluster and other residues (see Fig. 2).

Comparison of T4moC structure with results of paramagnetic NMR studies For T4moC, previous selective labeling studies [20] using 2 H-, 13C-, and 15N-amino acids revealed resonances that were predicted to arise from residues that either ligate the [2Fe-2S] cluster (Cys45, His47, Cys64, His67) or provide HN bonds to the cluster and Sc ligands (His47, Gln48, Ile50, Ala66, His67). The residues previously identified to experience paramagnetic interactions corresponded in general to those

following crystal structures: biphenyl dioxygenase ferredoxin BphF (1FQT:A, Q=0.43), arsenite oxidase (1G8J:D, Q=0.32), Thermus thermophilus Rieske protein (1NYK:B, Q=0.27), the Rieske domain from the bovine mitochondrial bc1 complex (1RIE, Q=0.27), the Rieske domain from the chloroplast b6f complex (1RFS, Q=0.24), the Rieske domain from the yeast mitochondrial bc1 complex (1KYO, Q=0.18), the Rieske domain

whose resonances were not assigned during the structure determination. The present structure is consistent with previous conclusions from paramagnetic NMR assignments that the HN atoms of His47 and His67 donate hydrogen bonds to bridging sulfide atoms and that the HN atoms of Cys45 and Cys64 donate hydrogen bonds to cysteinyl Sc atoms. In our previous NMR work, five distinct backbone N resonances from 15N-His were observed, accounting for all of the His residues present in T4moC. For oxidized T4moC, the resonance at 158.7 ppm was assigned to one of the cluster ligand His HN, while the resonance at 122.6 ppm was assigned to the other His HN, near to the frequency expected for a diamagnetic His-N HN. These two resonances shifted by $120 ppm upon reduction and were clearly resolved from the other three diamagnetic His HN resonances. The ∞ oxidized solution structure places His47-N at $5 A from ∞ from both one l-sulfido atom, while His67-N is $5 A Cys64-Sc and the other l-sulfido atom. Selective labeling also indicated a paramagnetic interaction between the N atoms of Gln48 and Ala66 [20], while no paramagnetically shifted resonance was observed from 15N-Ile labeling; this predicted interaction with Ile50-N could not be confirmed. At least 12 other paramagnetically shifted 15N resonances were detected but not assigned in spectra obtained from oxidized, [U-15N]-labeled T4moC. The present NMR structure suggests that the N atoms of Gln48, Glu49, ∞ Ile50, and Leu68 are located within $6 A of the lsulfido atoms of the [2Fe-2S] core. It is likely that some of the unassigned paramagnetic N atoms may be represented in this group.

Conclusions
The NMR structure of T4moC most resembles that of BphF, a soluble electron carrier with similar function from a biphenyl dioxygenase complex. In particular, the lower subdomain is a close match. Differences in the upper subdomain, containing the [2Fe-2S] cluster, including the distance of the conserved Pro loop from the cluster and the relative orientations of the two domains, likely result from the paucity of NMR constraints in the region of the [2Fe-2S] center. Further paramagnetic NMR studies or the determination of a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure may shed further light on the origin of these differences.
