Abstract The crystal structures of the C57A and V13G molecular variants of Allochromatium vinosum 2[4Fe≠4S] ferredoxin (AlvinFd) and that of the homologous ferredoxin from Escherichia coli (EcFd) have been determined at 1.05-, ∞ 1.48-, and 1.65-A resolution, respectively. The present structures combined with cyclic voltammetry studies establish clear effects of the degree of exposure of the cluster with the lowest reduction potential (cluster I) towards less negative reduction potentials (E∞). This is better illustrated by V13G AlvinFd (high exposure, E∞ = -594 mV) and EcFd (low exposure, E∞ = -675 mV). In C57A AlvinFd, the movement of the protein backbone, as a result of replacing the noncoordinating Cys57 by Ala, leads to a ?50-mV upshift of the potential of the nearby

cluster I, by removal of polar interactions involving the thiolate group and adjustment of the hydrogen-bond network involving the cluster atoms. In addition, the present structures and other previously reported accurate structures of this family of ferredoxins indicate that polar interactions of side chains and water molecules with cluster II sulfur atoms, which are absent in the environment of cluster I, are correlated to the approximately 180≠250 mV difference between the reduction potentials of clusters I and II. These findings provide insight into the significant effects of subtle structural differences of the protein and solvent environment around the clusters of [4Fe≠4S] ferredoxins on their electrochemical properties.

Introduction One of the most fundamental aspects in the characterization of a redox metalloprotein is the determination of the reduction potential (E∞) of its cofactor and the elucidation of the structural features that affect this value [1]. The magnitude of the reduction potential of the metal active site delineates the catalytic activity of a redox metalloenzyme, as it specifies the range of substrates that can be transformed during the catalytic cycle [2]. Also, the metal sites of a large proportion of redox metalloproteins are involved in long-range electron transfer through the dielectric material made of protein moieties. Electrons are usually ∞ carried over distances of approximately 15 A between discrete redox sites [3]. These ubiquitous reactions have been framed into a theoretical perspective, including the factors that control the kinetics of electron transfer reactions in chemical and biological systems [4]. Among these factors, the difference in the reduction potential values, DE∞, between the electron donor and the electron acceptor, which is directly correlated with the ``driving force,'' DG∞, of the reaction, is one of the most significant factors, as has been verified experimentally by numerous electron transfer experiments with various redox metalloproteins [5]. The E∞ value results from the intrinsic properties of the metal site combined with its interactions with the surrounding protein environment. Extensive studies on various metalloproteins have identified parameters that determine the E∞ value. They include (1) the degree of exposure of the metal atom or its coordinated sphere to the protein surface, and, therefore, to the solvent [6], (2) the existence of weaker, compared with covalent, but still significant bonding interactions involving the metal first coordination sphere, for

instance, hydrogen bonds [6, 7], (3) the effect of coenzyme or protein-partner binding close to the metal active site, as has been documented in the case of nitrogenase [8], and (4) more generally, various effects that specifically stabilize one redox level of the active site, as can be observed by comparing [4Fe≠4S]-containing low-potential or high-potential ferredoxins (Fds) [9≠12]. It is thus of major importance to elucidate the detailed mechanisms by which these factors are operative in given classes of metalloproteins [1]. Iron≠sulfur proteins are one of the most prominent and ubiquitous classes of redox metalloproteins in biology, offering an unprecedented range of structural types and biological functions [2, 13≠15]. Among these metalloproteins, Fds possessing two [4Fe≠4S] clusters [16] have two subfamilies (Fig. 1): small (approximately 55 amino acids) isopotential 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds (IPFds), represented by those occurring in clostridia, have been most widely studied and they were shown to possess two isopotential clusters; slightly larger Fds [Allochromatium vinosum (Alvin)-like Fds], with novel structural and electrochemical properties, have been exemplified by the Fd isolated from the purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Allochromatium vinosum (AlvinFd) [17, 18]. AlvinFd was first isolated in 1966 [19] and its spectral and redox properties were investigated for the first time. The biological role of this Fd is essentially unknown, since its proposed involvement in CO2 assimilation [20] remains to be unambiguously demonstrated. It should be emphasized that these early studies of AlvinFd showed that to reduce its [4Fe≠4S] clusters, it was necessary to make use of the strong reducing power of illuminated chloroplasts [19]. However, such a property was overlooked when the first electrochemical characterization of the protein was reported [21], since the two clusters were considered as isopotential clusters. Electrochemical studies over a wider potential range established that AlvinFd exhibited very negative and largely different reduction potential values for its two clusters [18]. This remarkable difference of E∞ values was also reported in a less well characterized Fd from Azotobacter vinelandii (AvFd; AvFdIII) [22]. The assignment of the respective values to each cluster of AlvinFd was done by combining site-directed mutagenesis and electrochemical studies [18] assisted by appropriate spectroscopic means [23]. These assignments have not yet been challenged in the case of homologous Alvin-like Fds, namely, Thauera aromatica Fd (TaFd) [24] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Fd (PaFd) [6], which exhibit qualitatively similar electrochemical properties. No valid explanation is yet available to describe the nonconventional differences of the E∞ values in these 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds. To get additional insight into these questions, we have undertaken studies implementing accurate structural investigations by X-ray crystallography ∞ and detailed electrochemical measurements.

resolution structure of PaFd [6] allowed us to suggest possible structural features contributing to the widely spread E∞ values of the clusters in this protein. In the present work, we structurally characterized the V13G and C57A molecular variants of AlvinFd and the Alvin-like Escherichia coli Fd (EcFd). The replacement of the bulky Val13 side chain of AlvinFd by Gly was chosen because IPFds, with less bulky side chains at this position (Ala or Ser), exhibit much higher reduction potentials [18]. Close to the same cluster, Cys57 is the single noncoordinating Cys of the sequence, and is present in a subset of [4Fe≠4S]-containing Fds [25]. EcFd exhibits remarkable sequence variations, including, but not limited to, positions 13 (Met13) and 57 (Asn57). The crystal-structure studies were supplemented by thermodynamic and kinetic electrochemical ones of Alvin-like Fds, as well as the IPFds from Clostridium pasteurianum (CpFd) and the pathogenic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica (EhFd). The present structures, especially of the variant C57A at ∞ atomic resolution (1.05 A, the highest resolution for such proteins up to now), combined with the electrochemical results, emphasize the subtlety of the effects involving the protein and the solvent that are translated into very large shifts (several hundred millivolts) of the reduction potential values of seemingly identical [4Fe≠4S] clusters.

AlvinFd [27], and EhFd [28] under oxygen-free conditions have been already described. The molecular variant C57S AlvinFd was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, according to the procedure already described [18]. The DNA sequence coding for EcFd was amplified from genomic DNA in a PCR using two primers incorporating NdeI (on the 50 side) and PstI sites. The digested PCR fragment was cloned in the pT7-7 plasmid, the gene was expressed in E. coli K38/pGP1-2, and the protein was purified as previously described for AlvinFd [18]. Crystallization and data collection The crystallization setup was enclosed into a sealed glove bag filled with nitrogen. Crystals of the C57A and V13G AlvinFds were grown (in a nitrogen atmosphere) using the hanging drop method. A 1.5-lL drop of protein solution at a concentration of 11 mg/mL in 20 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer at pH 7.0 was mixed with 1.5 lL of reservoir solution. Crystals of the C57A AlvinFd (hexagonal rods) grew at 277 K from reservoir solutions containing 3.3≠3.5 M ammonium sulfate, 100≠ 300 mM sodium chloride, and 45≠100 mM Tris at pH ranging from 7.0 to 8.5. Crystals of V13G AlvinFd grew under the same conditions, except that pH 8.0 and 8.5 gave consistently much better results than pH 7.0≠7.5. The first crystals appeared after 2 days in the case of C57A AlvinFd and overnight in the case of V13G AlvinFd. These continued to grow for a further 1≠2 days before reaching their final size. EcFd crystals were grown similarly, except that 1.0 lL of protein solution at a concentration of 18 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.0, 50 mM NaCl, was mixed with 1.0 lL

of reservoir solution. The macroscopically best crystals of EcFd were hexagonal rods and grew from reservoir solutions containing 0.5 M CaCl2, 100 mM Tris≠HCl pH 9.0, 20% w/v PEG 4000. Cryoprotection was achieved by soaking the crystals for a few seconds in a solution consisting of 80% original well solution plus 20% (v/v) glycerol. Then the crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen and later placed in a 100 K cryostream at beamline X13 with fixed wave∞ length (0.81 A) at EMBL/DESY, Hamburg, equipped with a Mar 165-mm CCD detector and an Oxford Cryosystems cryostream. The best C57A AlvinFd crystal gave diffraction ∞ ∞ data between 50 and 1.05 A; only 14≠1.05-A data were, however, used for the refinement. The best V13G AlvinFd ∞ crystal gave useful data in the range 30≠1.48 A. The dif∞ (see Table 1 for data fraction range for EcFd was 30≠1.65 A processing and final refinement details). The HKL suite [34] was used to process and merge the intensity data. Data

reduction was performed with the programs Scalepack2mtz and TRUNCATE, from the CCP4 suite [35]. Structure determination and refinement C57A AlvinFd The structure was solved by isomorphous replacement, using the AlvinFd coordinates [29], from which all water molecules and the iron and sulfur atoms of the two clusters were removed. Removal of the cluster atoms did not compromise the fitness of the starting model; it allowed us, however, to immediately choose between the two alternatives for P3121 indexing, to have the same axes assignments as those of our starting model. Five percent of the data were flagged for Rfree calculations. The cluster atoms were clearly seen by inspection of the Fo - Fc and

the 2Fo - Fc maps and were subsequently included in the model. The refinement of the structure was performed using the program REFMAC [30], applying several cycles of rigid-body and restrained isotropic refinement alternately with ARP/wARP [31] cycles to find water molecules (which were subsequently verified manually). The refinement was interrupted by regular inspection of the electron density and refitting of the model with the program O [32], where necessary. The resolution range used in the refine∞ ment was gradually extended from 14≠1.4 to 14≠1.1 A. When a crystallographic R of 24% (Rfree = 25.5%) was reached, refinement proceeded using the SHELXL program [33] with the conjugate-gradient least-squares option and the default antibumping distance, chiral volume, and angle restraints for amino acids. Up to this point, refinement was run in parallel with merged and with unmerged Friedel reflections. However, since no anomalous scattering effects were detected in this procedure, only merged data were used from this point on. The cluster atoms were treated anisotropically at this point and were always kept unrestrained. Occupancies were set to 1 for protein atoms, except for the nine disordered side chains, which were refined in two discrete conformations with occupancies adding up to unity. In the early stages of refinement, the occupancies of water molecules were refined keeping the thermal parameters constant and were fixed afterwards. At R = 19% (Rfree = 20%), anisotropic refinement was applied to protein atoms and alternating cycles of SHELXL refinement and inspection of the electron density maps (using program O) were applied over the full useful data ∞ range (extending to 1.05 A). Anisotropic refinement was applied to the water molecules a few cycles later and led to R of 10.6% (Rfree = 13.5%) for reflections with F [ 4r(F). No hydrogen atoms at calculated positions were introduced. Finally, six cycles of block-diagonal least-squares refinement were performed, in which the data of the reference and working sets were merged. This allowed the calculation of the standard uncertainties. The final R factor was 11.6% for all reflections and 10.3% for reflections with F [ 4r(F). V13G AlvinFd The refinement followed the same approach as for C57A AlvinFd. Only differences in the refinement are listed below. All merged data were used from the beginning of the refinement. At R = 22% (Rfree = 26%), refinement proceeded using SHELXL. The distances between the cluster atoms were kept restrained to values determined from high-resolution structures. The occupancies of water molecules were constrained to 1, 0.75, or 0.5 after an initial refinement in which their B factors were kept constant ∞ (25 A2). The last step of anisotropic refinement decreased

the R factor to 13.6% (Rfree = 18.9%) for reflections with F [ 4r(F) and standard uncertainties were estimated as described earlier. E. coli Fd The determination of the real space group proved a difficult task, owing to the occurrence of merohedral twinning. The lattices of individual crystals overlapped, producing a single diffraction pattern that appeared to have higher diffraction symmetry (point group 622) than the real (point group 6) one. The program HKL [34] was used for data reduction. The solution of the structure could not be achieved before detwinning of the data (program DETWIN [35]) even after the determination of the correct space group. The twinning was analyzed first by the programs XPREP [35] and TRUNCATE [36]. The structure was first solved in the space group P32 by molecular replacement using the program PHASER [37] and the coordinates of AlvinFd [29] after the two [4Fe≠4S] clusters and the water molecules had been removed. The initial R was 49% and this high value was attributed to the missing clusters, whose density was revealed in the difference Fourier map. However, the six independent molecules of EcFd per asymmetric unit were related in pairs by the same twofold axis, which coincided with the 32 axis. Thus, the existence of a 62 axis was revealed and the data were reprocessed and detwinned in space group P62, in which the structure was solved again by the program PHASER [37]. The initial R was 48% and two subsequent cycles of rigid-body refinement of the protein atoms gave better electron density for the cluster atoms than in space group P32. Insertion of these atoms improved the structure (R = 31%) and the refinement proceeded using SHELX, because it uses the 2 2 unmodified twinned Fo which are refined against Fc that take into account both single-crystal domains of the 2 2 twinned crystal. The relevant equation is Fc º aFc1 ˛ 2 1 ¿ aﬁFc2 ; where a is the twin fraction and the single crystal domain components c1 and c2 are related by the twin law k, h, -l. This twin law describes a real space 180∞ rotation about the diagonal a ? b. The twin fraction was given an initial value of 0.37 as indicated by the Britton plot [38] and the cumulative distribution of H [39]. The clusters were refined using the same restraints as in V13G AlvinFd, and the protein part had the default geometric restraints [40]. The water molecules were automatically selected by the SHELXWAT routine and were checked by inspection of the electron density maps. The latter was crucial, since the twinning created ghost peaks of the cluster atoms that the automatic routine was attributing to water molecules. To optimize the data/parameter ratio, the protein thermal parameters were restrained by requiring similar isotropic thermal parameters for bonded atoms

∞ ∞ within 1.7 A with a r value of 0.2 A2. The refinement initially proceeded in parallel with and without employment of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. However, the convergence achieved when no restraints were incorporated was better, and thus the application of noncrystallographic symmetry restraints was not chosen as the preferable strategy. The twin fraction was refined to a final value of 0.45. The Ramachandran plots as calculated by the program PROCHECK [41] show that for C57A AlvinFd 90.0% of the non-Gly amino acid u/w values lie in the most favorable regions, 8.6% in additionally allowed regions, and 1.4% in generously allowed regions; for V13G AlvinFd, 89.9% reside in the most favorable regions, and the remaining 10.1% reside in the additionally allowed regions; for EcFd 79.6% reside in the most favored regions, 18.4% in the additionally allowed regions, and 2.0% in generously allowed regions. All bond distances and angles, ∞ ∞ except Ca≠Cb of Asp12 (1.583 A instead of 1.530 A) in C57A AlvinFd, lie in the range of values observed in the structure of small molecules [40]. No such discrepancies are observed in V13G AlvinFd, presumably because of the more restrained refinement. In contrast to the previous nontwinned structures, bond distances and angles exhibit some discrepancies in EcFd (on average, seven bond lengths and 35 angles per molecule), even though the refinement was carried out under geometric restrictions. This poor result can be attributed to the twinning of the crystals. The final models include amino acid residues 1≠81 for C57A and V13G AlvinFds and 1≠80 for EcFd. Several side chains are disordered. For C57A AlvinFd these are Val13, Glu15, Val31, Glu45, Ser47, Lys60, Ser63, Thr67, and Glu68. For V13G AlvinFd they are Glu28, Val31, Ser35, and Ser47. In addition, 245 positions of water molecules were located in C57A AlvinFd, 166 in V13G AlvinFd, and 290 in EcFd. The temperature (B) factors per residue of C57A, V13G, and EcFd (Figs. S1, S2, S3, respectively) show that for the two first proteins, apart from the Gln25Glu28 and Glu66-Asp69 loops, the protein atoms are very well defined. The B values of water molecules, except for two in C57A, five in V13G AlvinFd, and six in EcFd, all ∞ partially occupied, are well below 50 A2. Figures were generated by PyMOL [42]. The cavity volume encasing the clusters was calculated by the graphics program GRASP [43]. Electrochemistry The electrochemical properties of 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds were studied by cyclic voltammetry. The experiments were carried out using a low-volume electrochemical cell [44], and an AFCBP1 bipotentiostat from Pine Instrument

Company. The counter electrode was a platinum wire, the reference electrode was a calomel electrode (4 M KCl; Pine, AC11420SLS), and the working electrode was a gold electrode (Pine, AFE1E050AU). The electrodes were polished with alumina 0.05 and cleaned by sonication for 1 min, before each experiment. All potentials were referenced to the normal hydrogen electrode, taking E∞(Hg/ HgCl2) = ?244 mV, at 298 K [45]. The concentration of the protein sample was in the 0.6≠1.5 mM range (3.0 mM for EcFd), in 20 mM Tris pH 7.0. A 60 lM mixture of  methyl viologen (EMV º ¿455 mV) and 40 ,400 -dimethyl0 00 0 00  1 ,1 -trimethylene-2 ,2 -dipyridinium bromide ( EDMTQ º ¿680 mV [46]) was adsorbed on the working electrode and used as a redox mediator, since no well-defined electrochemical response was observed in its absence. A blank electrochemical experiment on the 60 lM mediator mixture at a scan rate of 10 mV/s was performed, from which a featureless voltammogram was obtained, as already observed in previous studies [18]. All measurements were made in a strictly anaerobic atmosphere under a stream of argon. The error in the reported reduction potential values was estimated to be below ±5≠10 mV. The magnitude of the heterogeneous rate constants ks was calculated by applying the Nicholson method [47] to a series of voltammograms at different scan rates. For electrochemical signals qualified as ``reversible,'' only a lower limit of ks can be estimated, whereas for the ``quasi-reversible'' ones, ks can be accurately calculated [45]. The kinetic electrochemical analysis was carried out after subtracting the baseline of the voltammograms, using the UTILS software developed, and kindly provided, by Hendrik A. Heering (University of Leiden, The Netherlands). Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 3EUN (C57A AlvinFd), 3EXY (V13G AlvinFd), and 2ZVS (EcFd).

Results Electrochemistry of 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds Despite the large structural similarities in the cluster surrounding regions of small soluble proteins bearing two low-potential [4Fe≠4S] clusters [6, 14, 29, 48], the values of the reduction potentials span a wide range of more than 350 mV. A series of such proteins was studied by cyclic voltammetry under identical experimental conditions for accurate comparison. This series includes the extremes of the above range with the AlvinFd-like EcFd and with EhFd (Table 2). A clear-cut difference appears between IPFds, such as CpFd and EhFd, and Alvin-like ones, such as EcFd

Therefore, the two clusters of IPFds have the same reduction potential, whereas the Alvin-like Fds differ; each redox transition was assigned via site-directed mutagenesis of AlvinFd, the most negative being associated with cluster I (bound to Cys8, Cys11, Cys14, and Cys53) and the less negative one with cluster II (bound to Cys37, Cys40, Cys49, and Cys18 [18, 23]) (Fig. 2). Replacement of the single non-cluster-binding Cys57 by Ser did not change the reduction potential values of the clusters, but when Ala replaced Cys in this position, a selective upshift of approximately 50 mV was observed for cluster I (Table 2). Also, replacement of the bulky Val13 by Gly resulted in a similar shift of approximately ?50 mV for the same cluster. It had previously been reported that the effects of these two changes of amino acids (C57A and V13G) could be accumulated to induce larger differences of cluster I potential in an almost perfectly additive way [27]. The differences among the clusters found in the abovementioned proteins extend to their kinetic behavior in electron transfer reactions with electrodes. The rate constants (ks) of heterogeneous electron exchange have been measured (Table 2). The single value that can be determined for IPFds is in the 1 9 10-3 ≠ 4 9 10-3 cm/s range under quasi-reversible conditions for scan rates above 10 mV/s, in agreement with previous estimates [18, 49, 50]. Slightly higher values were generally measured for cluster II of Alvin-like Fds under a similar quasi-reversible regime, but the value for cluster II of EcFd almost reached

2 9 10-2 cm/s. In contrast to cluster II, cluster I displayed reversible electro-kinetic properties and very fast electron exchange that previously could not be measured precisely but assigned only a lower limit of 5 9 10-2 cm/s [23]. Thus, the two clusters of Alvin-like Fds exhibit largely different interactions with the gold working electrode. An exception to the observed behavior of cluster I in Alvinlike Fds is cluster I of EcFd, exhibiting quasi-reversible electrochemical signals at scan rates of 30≠50 mV/s, from which a ks value of 1.3 9 10-2 cm/s was derived. The similar E∞ values for the variants V13G, (D12G ? V13G) and C57A precluded the accurate characterization of the anodic (ipa) and cathodic (ipc) currents [45, 47] for the two redox transitions. Yet, an attempt was made to estimate the ks values for V13G AlvinFd. By assuming that ipa/ipc = 1, we determined the rate constants ks(II) = 1 9 10-2 cm/s (averaging values at scan rates of 20≠100 mV/s) and ks(I) [ 4 9 10-2 cm/s (scan rates of 10-20 mV/s). Therefore, replacing residues in certain positions around cluster I does not strongly reduce the heterogeneous rate constant of this cluster in AlvinFd (Table 2). The newly solved structures of 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds The overall folding of the variants C57A (Fig. 1a) and V13G is similar to that of the previously reported native AlvinFd [29] and PaFd [6]. The main general features are a well-defined 3.5-turn C-terminal a-helix, a2 (Ser67Gly80), and an ovoid N-terminal IPFd domain (Fig. 1b) that encases the clusters [48]. Additional secondary structure elements are limited to a cluster-joining one-turn a-helix, a1 (Cys49≠Cys53), a 310 helix (Cys14≠Cys18),

four antiparallel b-strands, b1≠b4 (Leu2-Lys3, Ile23Gln25, Tyr30-Ile32 and Leu60-Asp61, respectively), and four prominent loops (L1≠L4), L4 (Asp61-Asn64) linking the two domains of the protein. Conserved water molecules, either on the surface of the molecule or buried, seem to be a peculiar feature in Alvin-like Fds. Thus, four water molecules (named W1, W3, W4, W5 in C57A) form a conserved network, connecting the two pairs of b-strands by hydrogen bonding to strands b1 and b3 and forming an extended pseudo b-sheet. Three of the above-mentioned water molecules are also present in the atomic-resolution structure of the IPFd from Clostridium acidurici (CauFd) [48] (Fig. 1b). There are additional conserved water molecules: W2, W6, and W7 (in C57A), the last two being located at the extensions of the above-mentioned water network of Alvin-like Fds (vide infra). The structure of EcFd has some distinct features as compared with those of AlvinFd and PaFd deriving from slight sequence differences. On the basis of the sequence similarity of the C terminus between EcFd and AlvinFd with 15 aligned similar amino acids out of the last 27, Pro56 of EcFd should be an insertion in the AlvinFd sequence (Fig. 2). However, the 3D structure (Fig. 4) shows that EcFd aligns as shown in the lower part of Fig. 2, with Pro56 matching Asp56 of AlvinFd, and only

four aligned side chains sharing physicochemical properties at the C terminus. Superposition and least-squares fitting of the main-chain atoms of the two structures ∞ resulted in an average RMS deviation of 0.53 A (0.54, ∞ for the three EcFd molecules in the 0.55, and 0.50 A asymmetric unit). Thus, the overall folding remains the same as for AlvinFd despite the unexpected difference at the C terminus. Examples of significant but structurally silent changes in EcFd are (1) the interaction of the thiolate of the noncoordinating Cys57 with S2 of cluster I in AlvinFd being substituted by the Asn57¡¡¡S3 and Thr58¡¡¡S2 interactions (Fig. 4, distances in Table S1), (2) the replacement of Lys74 in AlvinFd by Asp74 in EcFd (vide infra), and (3) the positioning of some hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal helix to the exterior of the protein, in contrast to the other Alvin-like Fds. Nevertheless, the exposed side chains are organized in local hydrophobic pockets without major destabilization of the structure. The environment of cluster II The nonpolar interactions between C-terminal a-helix residues (Leu71, Ile78 in AlvinFd) and residues (Val41, Leu36) of the IPFd domain [6, 29] are fully conserved in the newly determined structures. These contacts shield the

The scan rate was 10 mV/s for EhFd and EcFd, and 20 mV/s for C57A AlvinFd. The potentials are referenced with respect to the saturated calomel electrode (SCE)

coordinating Cys40 of cluster II from the solvent. Nevertheless, Cys40 of Alvin-like Fds [6, 29] (and the present work) participates in polar interactions in the interior of the

protein where a water molecule is entrapped (W2 in C57A, Figs. 1, 5a), which is conserved in Alvin-like Fds and hydrogen-bonds to Thr38OG1, Val41O, His43ND1, and Asn20OG. The Thr38 hydroxyl group, pointing towards the interior, hydrogen-bonds to S3 of cluster II (Table 3). Another conserved water molecule (W6 in C57A) participates in an extended hydrogen-bonding network involving Lys74NZ, Pro34O, Cys37O, Glu66OG (in AlvinFd and PaFd), and the N-terminal amine group (Figs. 1, 6a). The N terminus is buried inside the protein and it forms salt bridges with the Glu66 and Glu39 carboxylic groups; it helps, along with W6, to drag Lys74, Glu 39, and Glu66 side chains towards the interior of the protein, not far from Cys37SG of cluster II (Table 3). The replacement of Lys74 by Asp74 (different charge and length) in EcFd is interesting. Nevertheless, the key role of the Lys74NZ atom in Alvin-like Fds, i.e., to orient the C-terminal helix and the connecting loop to the main body of the protein, is played by the carboxylic group of Asp74 in EcFd, which is involved in a hydrogen-bond network including a fully occupied water molecule and the carbonyl oxygen atoms of residues Asp35 and Cys37 (Fig. 6b). The additional substitution of Val66 in EcFd in place of Glu66, which was connecting the loop with the terminal NH2 group, does not affect the position of the latter, which interacts with Glu39OG2 and Ala64O via hydrogen bonds. Thus, although the detailed interactions are different in EcFd, polar interactions are conserved close to this face of cluster II. Finally, in all Alvin-like Fd structures determined so far, a cluster II sulfur atom is found within hydrogen-bond

distance from a hydroxyl group bearing side chain. These are Ser47 in AlvinFd, Ser1 in PaFd, and Thr48 in EcFd (Table 3). The environment of cluster I Superposition and least-squares fitting with the program LSQKAB [51] of the main-chain atoms of the two newly obtained structures of the AlvinFd variants C57A and V13G resulted in an RMS deviation in coordinates of ∞ 0.17 A. If the sites of the mutations spanning residues

11≠14 and 56≠58 were not included in the superposition, ∞ the corresponding RMS deviation was 0.14 A. The average main-chain differences for residues 56≠58 are 0.412, 0.425, ∞ and 0.168 A, respectively, whereas they are 0.283, 0.290, ∞ 0.133, and 0.244 A for residues 11≠14, respectively. Therefore, the two AlvinFd variants display localized structural differences at the sites of the introduced single amino acid changes around cluster I. Specifically, replacement of Cys57 by Ala induced a significant shift of the main chain towards cluster I (Fig. 7a), in contrast to V13G, whose main chain showed only small shifts around

∞ The C57A AlvinFd structure at 1.05-A resolution gives an opportunity to compare the cluster geometry with similarly accurate models of [4Fe≠4S]-containing Fds [48, 52] of higher reduction potential (approximately -400 mV). Although cluster I of C57A AlvinFd displays a reduction potential nearly 200 mV lower, its metrical values (Tables S2, S3) fall within the same range, including the [4Fe≠4S] cluster of high-potential Fds [6, 53]. The only discrepancy may be the Fe2-SG(Cys11) bond length of C57A AlvinFd ¥ ∞ that seems to be 0.03≠0.05 A shorter than in other cases. Other metrical parameters of the clusters have been analyzed in detail (Tables 4, S4, S5, S6, S7) with particular scrutiny of (1) the set of N≠H¡¡¡S hydrogen bonds involving sulfur atoms of the clusters, as they contribute to the distribution of the electronic density [54], (2) the electrostatic surroundings with the nearby dipoles and the solvent exposure of the sulfur atoms, and (3) the cavity volumes accommodating the [4Fe≠4S] clusters. As shown in Table 4, the only difference in C57A AlvinFd as compared with PaFd [6] and V13G AlvinFd results from the movement of the main chain towards cluster I and concerns the decrease of the 57 N¡¡¡SG53 ∞ distance by more than 0.15 A. In V13G Alvin Fd, as compared with C57A AlvinFd and PaFd, the V13 replacement weakens all hydrogen bonds involving inorganic sulfur atoms of cluster I and strengthens the 13 N¡¡¡SG11 interaction. In contrast, the closeness of the N≠H¡¡¡S bonding distances in cluster II of C57A, V13G Alvin Fds and PaFd is remarkable. The main-chain dipoles (CO and NH) retain their orientation in all structures examined, not only between the variants C57A and V13G of AlvinFd but also with PaFd, and even with the IPFd, CauFd. However, as a consequence of the replacement of the bulky Val13 by Gly, the Cys11SG atom of cluster I is significantly (and to a lesser extent S1) exposed on the protein surface as reflected in the accessibility values (Table 4). In contrast, the corresponding Cys40SG atom of cluster II is completely shielded. It has been previously proposed [6] that a large cavity accommodating the [4Fe≠4S] cluster is more likely to easily accept an extra electron, hence affording a readily accessible redox transition with a relatively high potential, than a smaller one. As shown in Table 4, the V13G and C57A AlvinFd variants display a larger cluster I cavity than PaFd; however, the differences in volumes between the clusters are not as pronounced as in PaFd.

Discussion The present high-resolution crystal structures of AlvinFd variants C57A and V13G and the homologous EcFd significantly extend the number of 2[4Fe≠4S] Fds that have been precisely characterized. This knowledge is used to gain insight into the electrochemical behavior of the two clusters of these Fds. In the IPFd, the clusters exhibit the same reduction potentials, in agreement with their rather symmetrical environments, i.e., CauFd in Fig. 1b. In contrast, in Alvin-like Fds a break of noncrystallographic internal symmetry takes place close to cluster II by the addition of the C-terminal a-helix and of the 64≠68 loop [6, 29] (Fig. 1a). Accordingly, the clusters have widely different reduction potentials. Contributors to the reduction potential of [4Fe≠4S] clusters One would expect that the reduction potential of cluster II in Alvin-type Fds, which is buried and has a calculated accessibility of zero (Table 4), would be low. However, the intriguing observation [18] is that while the cluster II potential is lowered by only 60≠70 mV compared with that of CauFd, the potential of cluster I is lowered by approximately 250 mV (Table 2). In CauFd [48], water molecule W69, hydrogen-bonding to Cys40SG, and polar interactions between Cys37SG and Asp39OD1 (Table 3), close to W4 and the N terminus in the vicinity of cluster II, can be considered as almost equivalent to the interactions of Ser10OG hydrogenbonding to Cys8SG of cluster I and water molecule W38 near cluster I (Figs. 1, 5, 8). These strong polar interactions of the CauFd clusters, in addition to the NH¡¡¡S bonds

(Table 4) with the main chain, are nearly symmetrical; thus, they do not differentiate the reduction potentials of the clusters. On the other hand, all known structures of Alvin-like Fds show that, although cluster II is shielded from the solvent, two fully occupied and conserved water molecules (W2 and W6 in C57A) are enclosed in internal pockets (Fig. 1). Their distances from the cluster II sulfur atoms are longer than for W69 and W4 of CauFd, indicating weaker interactions. However, they induce more polar interactions, since they attract the side chains of polar residues towards the interior of the protein and close to the cluster II sulfur atoms (Table 3): Thr38 and Asn20, with W2 close to Cys40 (Fig. 5a), and Lys74, Glu66, and Asp39, with W6 close to Cys37 (Fig. 6a), are involved in networks of hydrogen bonding. The latter is true also in EcFd, in which Lys74 and Glu66 are not conserved; nevertheless a water molecule equivalent to W6 is present in a similar internal pocket (vide supra, Fig. 6b). In addition to this, a hydrogen bond is established between a cluster II Cys sulfur atom and a hydroxyl group bearing side chain (different in each Fd) pointing inside (Ser47 in AlvinFd, Ser1 in PaFd, and Thr48 in EcFd) (Table 3). Thus, the weaker water interactions of Alvin-like Fds, as compared with CauFd, close to cluster II are compensated by a series of additional strong polar interactions and the hydrogen-bonding with buried polar side chains. The interactions of cluster II described are expected to stabilize its reduced form, resulting in a value of the reduction potential close to that in CauFd. In contrast, the polar interactions in the vicinity of cluster I of the Alvin-like Fds and CauFd are different. Ser10 of the latter is substituted by Asn10, a specifically conserved residue in Alvin-like Fd sequences (Fig. 2). Asn10OD1 is

∞ found at approximately 4.2 A from Cys8SG and is not hydrogen-bonding to Cys8SG but to a water molecule (W7 in C57A, corresponding to W38 of CauFd) (Table 3). However, W7 of the Alvin-like Fds is positioned at a much ∞ longer distance (6.28 A) from Cys8SG (Figs. 1, 8) as compared with the distance of W38 of CauFd from Cys8SG ∞ (4.68 A). No polar side chains are inwardly oriented in Alvin-like Fds that are able to hydrogen-bond to sulfur atoms of cluster I, as is the case in the vicinity of cluster II.

Therefore, the sulfur atoms of cluster I of Alvin-like Fds experience a less polar environment than cluster II or the CauFd clusters. Consequently, the reduction potential of cluster I is more negative than those of other Fd-bound [4Fe≠4S] clusters. It is relevant at this point to mention the L44S AvFdI molecular variant (L44 is similar sequencewise to V13 in AlvinFd [55]), in which a serine has been introduced. The reduction potential of the [4Fe≠4S] cluster in this [3Fe≠4S][4Fe≠4S] Fd was upshifted by almost 100 mV, a

result assigned to a hydrogen bond between the Ser side chain and the cluster coordinating Cys42SG, i.e., to the introduction of a polar side chain in the vicinity of the cluster. The present study shows that similar upshifts of the reduction potential of cluster I in AlvinFd have been achieved herein by amino acid substitutions close to this cluster (Table 2). Indeed, replacement of Val13 by Gly increased the reduction potential by nearly 50 mV. Additional replacement of Asp12 by Gly increased the potential further by an additional 50 mV [27]. The trend was extended with the triple variant in which Asp12 and Val13 were replaced by Gly residues and Cys57 by Ala to afford a total upshift of approximately 160 mV [27]. It is reasonable then to propose that each substitution reveals an independent structural contributor to the value of the reduction potential. The present structural data of V13G show that the main consequence of replacing bulky Val13 by Gly is to expose two cluster I sulfur atoms, S1 and Cys11SG, to the protein surface (Fig. 9; Table 4). Ready solvent access of an inorganic sulfur atom in low-potential [4Fe≠4S] clusters is unprecedented in available structures of clostridial and Alvin-like Fds. This observation has some bearing as to the position of the ferrous pair of ions in reduced low-potential [4Fe≠4S] clusters: In all cases studied so far, the electron added to the oxidized cluster upon reduction is mainly located on the cubane surface formed by Fe2, bound to Cys11, Fe4, S1, and S3 [23]. The structural correlation between the increased exposure of S1 and Cys11SG and the upshift of the reduction potential (50 mV) can thus be rationalized. Conversely, in EcFd, Met13 (Fig. 2) protects Cys11SG from solvent access (Fig. 9d). This likely contributes to the very negative reduction potential (-675 mV) of cluster I (Table 2), the most negative value recorded for a [4Fe≠4S]2?/? cluster in a soluble protein up to now (this value only compares with that estimated for cluster Fx in photosystem I among biologically reducible iron≠sulfur clusters [56]). Accordingly, the Alvin-like Fd from TaFd displays a relatively nonbulky Ala in position 13 and an upshift of its cluster potential of approximately 50 mV [24]. In addition, the Fd cluster of ABCE1 from Pyrococcus abyssi, a homolog of the essential yeast protein Rli1p and of human Hsa involved in ribosome function, has the bulky Ile60 in the position corresponding to Val13 in AlvinFd, which shields the cluster from the solvent. This cluster is not readily reduced by potentials as low as approximately -560 mV [57, 58]. In the ligand-bearing canonical motif of low-potential [4Fe≠4S] clusters, a free Cys is sometimes found in the n ? 4 position following the isolated Cys(Pro) ligand. In Alvin-type Fd, this corresponds to Cys57 (Fig. 2). Similarly available Cys residues neighboring iron≠sulfur clusters have already been found to act as ligand substitutes [59, 60]. Substitution of Cys61 following (n ? 6) the

Cys55 ligand of Rhizobium meliloti FdxN abolished the symbiotic nitrogen fixation ability of the bacterium [61], suggesting that the single free Cys in this Fd may be functionally important. The reduction potential of cluster I in C57A AlvinFd is increased by about 50 mV compared with that of AlvinFd (Table 2), as found also by replacement of the noncoordinated Cys24 by Ala in [4Fe≠ 4S][3Fe≠4S] AvFdI [62, 63]. The present high-resolution C57A AlvinFd structure associates this effect with movement of the protein backbone in the vicinity of residue 57 towards the cluster (Fig. 7). This fills part of the gap created close to one face of the inorganic cluster by the removal of the sulfur atom of the side chain, allowing residue 57 atoms to come closer to the S2 and SG53 cluster atoms, thus shifting the potential to less negative values. In the case of the free noncoordinating Cys (Cys57 for AlvinFd), removal of the polar side chain alone, without any main-chain movement from the vicinity of cluster I, would destabilize the reduced form and would not suffice to explain the upshift of the cluster I potential. Apparently, it would also be in contrast with the rationale (vide supra) used for cluster II. Thus, simple predictions about the electrostatic potential around clusters may be misleading if the structural relaxation of the protein, i.e., main-chain and side-chain movements, upon amino acid changes is not precisely known. The movement observed for C57A AlvinFd was not predicted to occur in C57S AlvinFd, since Ser and Cys side chains are both polar and they have the same number of atoms. Indeed, the present work does not evidence a reduction potential shift in the latter variant (Table 2). The interactions of Cys57SG with S2 and Cys53SG in AlvinFd have been substituted by those of Asn57ND2 with S3 and Thr58OG with S2 in EcFd (Fig. 4). However, the significance of the latter interactions for the reduction potential value is difficult to quantify in this case. This is due to the confounding presence of Met13 that diminishes the accessibility to cluster I and to the significantly reduced number of N≠H¡¡¡S bonds (vide infra), both driving the potential to lower values as compared with those for AlvinFd. Through its participation in the spreading of the electronic cloud of Fe4S4(SCys)(2-/3-) the network of N≠H¡¡¡S 4 hydrogen bonds should influence the value of the reduction potential [54]. If few such hydrogen bonds exist in a given structural framework, the potential is expected to have very negative values, as in EcFd cluster I (-675 mV). The structures of the two AlvinFd variants predict a small strengthening of a single hydrogen bond, out of eight, in C57A (57 N¡¡¡SG53), and a weakening of several of them in V13G (Table 4). Yet the similar upshifts of the potential for these two proteins suggest, at best, a correcting effect due to these changes, in view of the other more significant contributions discussed above.

It has previously been proposed [6] that a large cavity accommodating the [4Fe≠4S] cluster is more likely to easily accept an extra electron, hence affording a readily accessible redox transition with a relatively high potential, than a smaller one. As shown in Table 4, V13G and C57A variants display a larger cluster I cavity than PaFd. Therefore, the structural strain imposed on the volume housing cluster I of Alvin-type Fd may have a contribution to the upshift of the reduction potential of this redox center in the variants, in addition to the ones discussed above. Kinetic electrochemical behavior of Fds The changes of residues occurring around cluster I of Alvin-like Fds, either natural (Fig. 2) or artificially introduced (i.e., V13G and C57S), do not affect the fast electron transfer reaction of this center with the viologen (dipyridinium)-modified electrode (Table 2). Interestingly, the thermodynamically demanding reduction of cluster I, occurring at low potential, is not paralleled by a kinetically impaired electron transfer, implying that the factors contributing to the two properties are different. On the other hand, cluster II, with less negative potential in the same proteins, as well as the clusters of IPFds react more slowly with the same electrode. It must then be concluded that the interaction sites between the modified electrode and cluster I or cluster II of Alvin-like Fds are structurally distinct to explain (1) an approximately 1 order of magnitude difference in the respective heterogeneous rate constants and (2) their reversible or quasi-reversible electrochemical behavior, respectively. The present structures confirm that the environments of the two clusters in Alvin-like Fds are different. The larger surface accessibility of Cys11SG compared with Cys40SG (Table 4) could partly explain the faster electron exchange with the electrode of cluster I over cluster II. The slower electron exchange between the viologen-modified, positively charged electrode surface and cluster I of EcFd, as compared with the other Alvinlike Fds, may be due to the less negative charge distribution at the surface of EcFd around cluster I (Fig. 9). On the other hand, whether the relatively similar kinetic properties of cluster II of the Alvin-like Fds and the clusters of IPFds correspond to similar interactions with the electrode cannot be established at this stage. It should be stressed that (1) heterogeneous electron transfer has no physiological relevance and (2) redox reactions involving systems like the Fds are very difficult to interpret in molecular-structural terms. The lack of well-defined electrochemical response in the absence of mediators shows that there is no direct protein (Fd) electrochemistry, in agreement with previous reports [18, 49]. However, a very weak direct electrochemical response by a 2[4Fe≠4S] Fd, which developed slowly over the course of a few hours, was observed in

earlier studies [44]. The interaction between the redoxactive species employed in our work and the electrode surface could be elucidated by techniques such as in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy.

Conclusions In conclusion, the high-resolution structures of molecular variants of Alvin-like Fd displaying one cluster of very low potential (less than -600 mV) give an unprecedented opportunity to examine the influence of the surrounding protein and solvent environment on the reduction potential of the [4Fe≠4S] clusters. The structural results of the AlvinFd variant V13G and the comparison with EcFd displaying a Met in this position emphasize the importance of the cluster accessibility, particularly that of the face of the cubane structure hosting the ferrous pair of ions in reduced low-potential [4Fe≠4S] clusters. The high-resolution structure of the other variant, C57A, provides very accurate geometric details of cluster I having a reduction potential nearly 200 mV lower than conventional [4Fe≠ 4S]2?/? clusters, i.e., of IPFds. Yet, despite the large reduction potential difference, cluster I of C57A AlvinFd displays geometric parameters quite similar to these of clusters with less negative reduction potentials. Therefore, it can be now unambiguously stated that variations in reduction potential values are not due to particular deformations of the clusters, but to changes in their environment. The two AlvinFd molecular variants experience similar upshifts of their cluster I reduction potentials, but the underlying structural reasons are different. This explains why these shifts are additive in molecular forms of AlvinFd with multiple substitutions. Cluster II is inaccessible to the solvent but polar interactions introduced by the encapsulation of conserved water molecules and polar side chains in the interior of the protein moderate the downshift of its reduction potential to only 60≠70 mV as compared with the clusters of IPFds. On the other hand, the approximately 250 mV lower reduction potential of cluster I in the Alvin-like Fds, as compared with the IPFds, is explained both by weaker polar interactions and by decreased solvent accessibility induced by the side chains. Taken together, the above observations open the way to experimentally dissect the different contributors to the value of the reduction potential of iron≠sulfur clusters by mixing detailed structural and electrochemical studies. Such an integrated experimental approach is clearly needed as currently available tools are of very limited predictive value even for very similar proteins such as those studied herein, despite some promising efforts [64].
