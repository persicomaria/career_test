Gomesin is the first peptide isolated from spider exhibiting antimicrobial activities. This highly cationic peptide is composed of 18 amino-acid residues including four cysteines forming two disulfide linkages. The solution structure of gomesin has been determined using proton two-dimensional NMR (2D-NMR) and restrained molecular dynamics calculations. The global fold of gomesin consists in a wellresolved two-stranded antiparallel b sheet connected by a noncanonical b turn. A comparison between the structures of gomesin and protegrin-1 from porcine and androctonin from scorpion outlines several common features in the

distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. The N- and C-termini, the b turn and one face of the b sheet are hydrophilic, but the hydrophobicity of the other face depends on the peptide. The similarities suggest that the molecules interact with membranes in an analogous manner. The importance of the intramolecular disulfide bridges in the biological activity of gomesin is being investigated. Keywords: spider; cysteine-rich; antimicrobial peptide; b sheet; NMR.

In recent years, it has become widely recognized that animal defense systems rely on inducible or constitutive expression of antimicrobial peptides in response to bacterial and/or fungal infections. Among these antimicrobial molecules, open-ended cyclic cysteine-rich peptides are the most widespread. They have been characterized in plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. Structurally, they can be classified into (a) peptides adopting a b sheet structure, namely the mammalian defensins [1]; (b) peptides exhibiting the CSab (cysteine stabilized a helix b sheet) motif [2] such as defensin A from Phormia terranovae [3], drosomycin from Drosophila melanogaster [4], heliomicin from Heliothis virescens [5], plant defensins [6]; and (c) peptides adopting a b-hairpin-like fold, such as tachyplesins from horseshoe crabs [7,8], porcine protegrins [9,10], thanatin from the bug Podisus maculiventris [11], androctonin from the scorpion Androctonus australis [12], lactoferricin B from bovine [13] and a 20-residue antimicrobial peptide from the plant Impatiens balsamina [14]. All the peptides adopting a b hairpin structure possess a broad antimicrobial activity spectrum. In contrast, peptides with a CSab motif have a more restricted activity spectrum; insect defensins are mainly active against Gram-positive bacteria whereas drosomycin, heliomicin and plant defensins are active exclusively against fungi. While there are numerous reports on the structural characterization and the three-dimensional structure of polypeptide toxins from spider venoms (for review see [15]),

it is only very recently that a peptide with antimicrobial activity has been characterized from spiders [16]. This peptide, gomesin, is an 18-residue cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptide isolated from the blood cells (hemocytes) of the mygalomorph spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. Gomesin has two disulfide bridges linking Cys2 to Cys15 and Cys6 to Cys11. In addition, gomesin carries two post-translational modifications: cyclization of the N-terminal glutamine into pyroglutamic acid (pGlu or Z) and amidation of the C-terminal arginine. The molecule is highly cationic (pI º 9.86 calculated by EDITSEQ from DNA STAR 4.05 software) with the presence of five arginines, one lysine, a C-terminal amidation and no acidic amino acid. Gomesin exhibits broad activity at rather low concentrations (often below 10 lM) against numerous microorganisms including bacteria, filamentous fungi and yeast. In addition, this peptide was found to affect the viability of the parasite Leishmania amazonensis and to present some hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes. Sequence alignments suggest strong similarities with various antimicrobial peptides adopting a b sheet structure, such as tachyplesins, androctonin, and protegrins [16]. In this paper, we report on the elucidation of the solution structure of gomesin using two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. Gomesin adopts a well-defined b-hairpin-like structure as it could be expected from the sequence similarities with androctonin and protegrins. The structure of these three peptides are compared in order to determine the structural features required for their biological properties.

Solution structure of gomesin (Eur. J. Biochem. 269) 1191

The sample for NMR spectroscopy was prepared by dissolving 4.5 mg of synthetic gomesin in 90%H2O/ 10%D2O to obtain a final solution at 3.3 mM. The pH was adjusted to 3.5 with microlitre increments of HCl 1 N. For experiments in heavy water, 90% of the volume of the previous sample was lyophilized and then dissolved in 99.99% D2O. The remaining volume (10%) was completed with H2O to obtain a gomesin solution at 0.3 mM. A conventional set of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra in H2O, including DQF-COSY [17], Clean-TOCSY [18] and NOESY [19], was acquired at a temperature of 278 K on a VARIAN INOVA NMR spectrometer equipped with a z-axis field-gradient unit and operating at a proton frequency of 600 MHz. The cleanTOCSY spectrum was collected with a spin lock time of 80 ms using the MLEV-17 mixing scheme [20] and NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 120 ms and 300 ms. Water suppression was achieved either by presaturation for COSY and TOCSY experiments or using the WATERGATE pulse sequence [21] for NOESY experiments. A new series of TOCSY and NOESY spectra in D2O was also recorded at 278 K. In an attempt to overcome ambiguities in assignment due to spectral overlap, a second set of clean-TOCSY and NOESY spectra was performed at 285 K. Spectra were acquired over a spectral width corresponding to 9 p.p.m. and referenced to the residual H2O signal set as the carrier frequency (4.964 p.p.m. at 278 K; 4.897 p.p.m. at 285 K). All two-dimensional NMR data were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indy O2 workstation using the VNMR software package (version 6.1; Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Assignments were carried out according to classical procedures including spin-system identification and sequential assignment [22] on maps recorded at 278 K. Cross-peak intensities of the NOESY map at 278 K with the shortest mixing time 120 ms and recorded over 4096 data points in the F2 dimension were integrated with XEASY [23]. The unusual N-terminal residue (pyroglutamic acid) was especially built for this work and its coordinates and appropriate parameters (bond length and atom charges) were included in the libraries of DYANA [24,25] and XPLOR [26] for molecular modeling. Structure calculations NOESY cross-peak intensities were converted into upper distance limit constraints using the CALIBA program [25]. The minimum distance constraint between two protons was ∞ limited by their van der Waals radi (2.0 A). Moreover, in order to assess possible contributions from spin diffusion effects, some NOEs only observable on the 300-ms mixing ∞ time NOESY map were taken into account with a 6-A upper limit constraint. Each of the two disulfide bridges was explicitly defined by three lower/upper distance limit restraints between the sulphur and b carbon atoms of ∞ the two cysteines i, j involved in the linkage (1.9 A < ∞ ∞ ∞ ∞ d(Sci,Scj) < 2.1 A; 2.5 A < d(Cbi,Scj) < 3.5 A; 2.5 A < ∞ d(Sci,Cbj) < 3.5 A). All these constraints were brought together in a distance restraint file used as input to initial steps of molecular modeling. Several sets of 100 structures were generated from random-built initial models using the annealing procedure of the variable target function

program DYANA. During these rounds of calculations, restraints corresponding to the stereospecific assignment of three methyl protons proposed by GLOMSA were incorporated in the data set [25]. The hydrogen bonds found at each round of calculations on a majority of structures and corresponding to atoms involved in secondary structure elements were also introduced as constraints. A final set of 50 structures was then generated in a final DYANA run from an input file taking into account the total set of constraints. Twenty out of these 50 DYANA structures were selected on ∞ the basis of low target function values (% 1A2) and subjected to energy minimization using Powell's algorithm and CHARMM force field parameters [27] implemented in X-PLOR 3.1 software. The energy calculations were performed with a distance dependent dielectric function ∞ e º r, a 12-A cut-off distance for all nonbonded interac∞ tions and a force constant of 50 kcal∆mol)1∆A)2 for NOE restraint energy terms. All calculations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics 02 R10000 workstation and the structures were visualized with the SYBYL software (TRIPOS Inc., St Louis, MO, USA). Hydrophobic potentials were calculated with the MOLCAD option [28] implemented in SYBYL. PROCHECK [29] and PROMOTIF [30] programs were used for structural analysis.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sequence-specific assignment and secondary structure Comparison of the one-dimensional spectra of the samples of gomesin at 0.3 mM and 3.3 mM in aqueous solution clearly shows the absence of any concentration-dependent changes in the chemical shifts or peak line widths, suggesting the monomeric state of the peptide in our experimental conditions. The two-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra of gomesin were assigned via standard sequential assignment methods developed by Wuthrich [22]. The entire spin ® systems of individual amino-acid residues were identified through DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments on the maps at 278 K. TOCSY and NOESY maps recorded at 285 K were used to clear up ambiguities in the assignment of the NH-Ha cross-peaks of Arg4 due to the close vicinity of its Ha chemical shift and of the water resonance. Moreover, dipolar connectivities on the D2O NOESY spectra enable the best-defined Ha-Ha peaks to be obtained near the residual water diagonal, especially between Cys2 and Cys15, Cys6 and Cys11, Arg4 and Thr13. The splitting of the resonance of backbone NH and Ha protons allows complete proton assignments for the fingerprint region (Fig. 1). 1H chemical shifts of gomesin are reported in Table 1 and the complete pathway Ha(i) ) NH(i + 1) is shown in Fig. 2. The NOE connectivity diagram exhibits dNN(i,i + 2) and daN(i,i + 2) NOEs between the central residues (Tyr7≠Arg10), suggesting the presence of a turn in this region (Fig. 3A). Strong daN(i,i + 1) NOEs in segments (Cys2≠Cys6 and Cys11≠Cys15) are indicative of two extended strands of b sheet. This hypothesis is confirmed by the presence of long-distance Ha(i)-Ha(j) connectivities detected on D2O maps even if deuterium exchange studies revealed that all amide protons were quickly exchanging with the solvent. Figure 3B shows the number of NOEs between two residues i and j with respect to the difference |i ) j|. The enhancement of the number of NOEs observed

for 5<|i ) j|<13 is mainly due to connectivities between the protons of residues Cys6 and Cys11 (|i ) j| º 5), Leu5 and Val12 (|i ) j| º 7), Arg4 and Thr13 (|i ) j| º 9), Arg3 and Tyr14 (|i ) j| º 11), Cys2 and Cys15 (|i ) j| º 13). Finally, no NOE cross-peak, indicative of an oligomeric association in solution, could be detected, which is consistent with the high abundance of positively charged residues (five arginines and one lysine) in the primary structure of the peptide. Structure evaluation The three-dimensional structure of gomesin was determined using the standard simulated annealing protocol of DYANA AND energy minimization with X-PLOR, as described in Materials and methods. The final restraint file comprised a set of 289 distance restraints including 82 intraresidual, 102 sequential, 32 medium-range (2 < |i ) j| < 5) and 73 long range (|i ) j|  5) restraints (with an average of 16 restraints per residue). Long-range limits concern mainly residues located in the segments corresponding to the two strands of the b sheet (pGlu1≠Tyr7; Arg10≠Arg16) (data not shown).

As shown in Table 2, the 20 selected structures are in very good agreement with all experimental data and the standard covalent geometry. There are no violations larger than ∞ 0.3 A and the root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) with respect to the standard geometry are low. Both negative van der Waals and electrostatic energy terms are indicative of favorable non-bonded interactions. Moreover, the Ramachandran plot exhibits nearly 91% of the (/,w) angles of all structures in the most favored regions and additional allowed regions according to the PROCHECK software nomenclature. The structure files have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb) with the accession number 1KFP. Structure description The overall fold of gomesin is formed by a hairpin-like structure with a two-residue extension at the C-terminal end. This hairpin-like structure consists of two antiparallel b strands (pGlu1≠Tyr7 facing Arg10≠Arg16) forming a twisted sheet and connected by a four-residue turn (Tyr7≠ Arg10). As shown in the structural statistics (Table 2) and

NH(Leu5)≠O(Val12), O(Leu5)≠NH(Val12) are found between the disulfide bridges as well as O(pGlu1)≠ NH(Arg16) and NH(Tyr7)≠O(Arg10) located at each extremity of the b sheet. Two interstrand disulfide bridges adopt a well-defined right-handed conformation with vSS, v1, v2 torsion angles close to the expected values for favorable energy conformers (Table 2). Moreover, whatever the model considered, the average distance between the Ca ∞ atoms of the cysteine residues is small (3.75 ± 0.10 A). This often occurs when disulfide bridges link antiparallel b-strands [31]. The backbone of the loop (Tyr7-Lys8Gln9-Arg10) also exhibits a well-defined conformation. When the structures are best fitted on the four backbone residues of the turn, the local pairwise rmsd of this turn is ∞ 0.22 A. The (i,i + 3) hydrogen bond between the CO group of Tyr7 and the NH group of Arg10 closing classical b turns is found only on 10 out of the 20 structures. Whatever the nomenclature used ([32] or [33]), this turn appears to be particularly difficult to classify as Lys8 exhibits positive / and w angles as observed in a left-handed helix and the /, w average values ()150∞,≠60∞) of Gln9 are very unusual. Owing to a lack of NOE data, the conformation of the two C-terminal residues Gly17 and Arg18, which are not included in the b sheet, is poorly defined. Most side chains of strand residues adopt a well-defined conformation due to the presence of numerous interstrand NOEs. In particular, significantly low circular variances [33] for v1 and v2 angles are observed for the four cysteines, for Tyr7, Val12, Thr13 and Tyr14 residues (CV < 0.1). Low v1 and v2 circular variances are also observed for long chain or bulky residues such as Arg4, Leu5, and Arg10 but, in these cases, the extremity of their side chain is rather floppy. In contrast, the side chains of Arg16 and Arg18 at the

Solution structure of gomesin (Eur. J. Biochem. 269) 1195

C-terminus, but also of Gln9 in the turn, display large conformational variability. Hydrophobic potentials The distribution of hydrophobic potentials at the Connolly surface of gomesin are presented on Fig. 5. The lack of definition of the extremity of several side chains does not significantly modify the distribution of hydrophobic potential on the surface whatever the model chosen. Gomesin b sheet is amphipathic, its structure clearly displays (a) an hydrophobic face formed by a large aggregate of hydrophobic residues (Leu5, Tyr7, Val12, and Tyr14) which are located on the concave surface of the peptide; and (b) a second face showing a globally intermediate potential through the presence of the two apolar disulfide bridges, the polar (Thr13) and the charged (Arg4) side chains. Two hydrophilic regions are located at the two spatial extremities of the molecule, at the C-terminus with Arg16 and Arg18, and in the turn with the presence of Lys8, Gln9 and Arg10. Comparison to b-hairpin-like antimicrobial peptides with two disulfide bridges Gomesin shares several physico-chemical properties with most antimicrobial peptides adopting a b-hairpin-like structure with two disulfide bridges [2]. All of them have a molecular mass of % 2 kDa, including a rather high percentage of basic residues (over 30%). In addition, their three-dimensional structures are stabilized by the presence of two internal disulfide bridges in a parallel arrangement: Cys1≠Cys4 and Cys2≠Cys3. Interestingly, they all have a broad spectrum of activity affecting the growth of various microorganisms as well as parasites. Sequence alignments

reveal high similarities between gomesin and peptides belonging to the families of tachyplesins and polyphemusins from horseshoe crabs [34,35], to androctonin from scorpion [36], and to PG-1 from porcine leukocytes [37]. We have compared the three-dimensional structure of gomesin to androctonin and to protegrin (PG-1) which coordinates are available in the Protein Data Bank. The three-dimensional structure of androctonin has been determined recently in aqueous solution ([12], PDB code 1CZ6). The structure of PG-1 has been studied in aqueous solution [9,10], in (CD3)2SO [9] as well as in the presence of micelles of dodecylphosphocholine [38]. Like gomesin, PG-1 contains 18 amino acids whereas androctonin is significantly longer with 25 residues. Although the spacing of the cysteine residues differs in gomesin, androctonin and PG-1, the three molecules adopt a similar rigid pleated b sheet structure. The two pairs of cysteine residues are separated by three residues in gomesin instead of only one in protegrin [37]. Androctonin presents an unequal number of residues on each strand between the two bridges, five in the N-terminal strand and three in the C-terminal strand. This leads to a higher twist of the b sheet of androctonin compared to the two other peptides. Despite such differences, the rmsd of the coordinates of the b strands of the three peptides when superimposed on the backbone ∞ atoms N, Ca, C¢ are very low, 0.85 A between gomesin ∞ and androctonin and 0.87 A between gomesin and prote∞ grin (1.25 A between protegrin and androctonin). On the basis of this best-fit superposition, we were able to perform a structural alignment of the three molecules (Fig. 6) which differs slightly from the sequence alignment presented by Silva Jr. et al. [16]. The three structures are stabilized by two tight disulfide linkages and a regular pattern of backbonebackbone hydrogen bonds typical of antiparallel b strands (pGlu≠Tyr7 and Arg10≠Arg11 in gomesin vs. Leu5≠Arg9

and Phe12≠Val16 in PG-1; Arg5≠Arg11 and Gly15≠Thr21 in androctonin). As with gomesin, the b turn of PG-1 is locally well defined and adopts an unclassified conformation. Nevertheless, the conformations of the two turns are different. In the case of PG-1, it seems subjected to a rigidgroup ‘hinge movement’ relative to the b sheet [9,10] and can adopt different orientations with respect to the rigid remaining part of the molecule. In androctonin, the two strands of the b sheet are not connected by a b turn, but instead, the chain reversal is ensured by a five memberedturn locally well defined. The structures of gomesin and androctonin are particularly well defined in the b sheet region. PG-1 shows a higher flexibility in water as pointed out by much larger rmsd (with respect to the average ∞ ∞ structure), 1.38 A and 0.8 A for the hairpin region ∞ in references [9,10], respectively, compared to 0.14 A for gomesin. Nevertheless, addition of (CD3)2SO reduces the flexibility of the PG-1 molecule [9]. Comparison of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on the molecule surfaces shows that gomesin and PG-1 structures share two highly hydrophilic and positively charged poles located in the N- and C-terminal regions and in the turn (PG-1: Arg9, Arg10, Arg11; gomesin: Lys8,

Gln9, Arg10) (Fig. 5). The turn of androctonin involving three arginines is highly hydrophilic and positively charged as well as its N-terminus (Arg1, Ser2). In contrast, the doublet Pro24≠Tyr25 gives a hydrophobic character to the C-terminus. A large difference concerns the distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic potentials on the surface of the b sheet between the tails and the turn. The gomesin b sheet is divided into two nonequivalent faces: hydrophobic side chains are clustered on the concave face (Leu5, Tyr7, Val12 and Tyr14), whereas two polar side chains (Arg4, Thr13) flanked by the apolar disulfide bridges are located on the other face of gomesin. The central portion of PG-1 is particularly hydrophobic as it contains only apolar residues Leu5, Cys6, Tyr7, Cys8, Phe12, Cys13, Val14, Cys15 and Val16 alternatively distributed on each side of the b sheet [9,10]. In androctonin, the highly twisted character of the b sheet does not suggest a clear dichotomy in the distribution of polar and apolar residues. The presence of three charged residues (Arg5, Lys8, and Lys19) distributed on each side of the sheet reduces considerably the hydrophobicity of the surface of androctonin when compared to the two other peptides (Fig. 5). Mode of action The mode of action of the three peptides is not yet clearly understood. It has been established that androctonin and PG-1 interact with the bacterial membrane. Concerning androctonin, biochemical experiments have shown that the peptide induces permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane and interacts with negatively charged membranes in a monomeric form [39], suggesting a mode of action similar to a detergent effect. On the basis of NMR structures, several models of binding of PG-1 to the cellular membrane have been proposed, some possibly with an oligomerization of

the peptides [10]. These models are supported by recent NMR studies of the peptide in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles [38], suggesting the formation of a dimeric structure and possibly of higher order associations. Oriented CD studies on PG-1 are indicative of two possible orientations of the peptide with respect to the membrane, depending on the peptide concentration, on the membrane components and on the hydration conditions [40]. This twostate model corresponds to (a) a functionally inactive binding state, when protegrin in low concentration tends to adsorb in the headgroup region of the membrane, leading to a decrease of the thickness of the lipid bilayer, and then to (b) an active state, when the peptide penetrates the hydrocarbon core of the bilayer leading to the disruption of the membrane integrity, probably through the formation of pores [40]. The similarities between the three-dimensional structure of gomesin and those of PG-1 and androctonin suggest that gomesin exerts antibacterial activity by interacting with the cytoplasmic bacterial membrane. Differences in the distribution of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues at the surface of the three peptides may indicate different modes of action on the membrane. This may also account for differences in the hemolytic activity of the peptide. Indeed, it has been suggested that, when compared, peptides with a high content of hydrophobic residues are more hemolytic [41]. In this respect, the different levels of hemolytic activity in androctonin, gomesin and protegrin could be linked to the difference of hydrophobicity of their central part. The prerequisite for antibacterial activity is still controversial. Over the last few years, a growing opinion argues that only the maintenance of the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance in those highly cationic peptides is the key point for activity. This viewpoint has to be taken with caution; in some cases, as with tachyplesins, the presence of disulfide bridges leading to the formation of a well-folded amphipathic b sheet structure does not seem essential for activity [42]. For other peptides, such as protegrins, disulfide bridges would be necessary to ensure an antiparallel b sheet conformation leading to an active peptide [43]. In addition, protegrin analogues with particular amino-acid substitutions that eliminate hydrogen bonding across the b sheet have shown reduced activities [44]. To obtain a better understanding of the importance of disulfide bridges and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity of gomesin, synthetic analogues of this peptide that lack one or both cysteine disulfides have been designed and are now being testing against several strains of microorganisms and euckaryotic cells. The first results obtained suggest that both disulfide bridges are important for the maintenance of the full biological activity. Gomesin analogs with only one bridge or linear gomesin remain active but with a specificity towards particular microorganisms (S. Daffre, Departmento de Parasitologia, ICB, Universidade de Sao, ~ Paulo, Brazil, personal communication). The hydrophobic/ hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity of gomesin is also investigated. In conclusion, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of gomesin which adopts a well-defined b sheet structure like other open-ended cyclic peptides. Gomesin is active at low concentration (below 10 lM) against a large number of bacterial and fungal strains. The presence of two disulfide bridges, C-terminal amidation as well as

N-terminus cyclization tends to protect gomesin from proteolytic degradation. These properties, associated to a rapid killing of various bacterial and fungal strains and to a relatively low hemolytic activity [16], are encouraging for potential applications of gomesin as a therapeutic agent. In addition, gomesin constitutes a novel probe for further studies of the interaction between b sheet peptides and membranes, since most biochemical and biophysical studies have been done on a helical structures. A better understanding of the action mode of these peptides is crucial for the development of a new generation of antibiotics.
