The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal lipoyl domain of the acetyltransferase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from Azotobacter vinelandii has been determined using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy and dynamical simulated annealing. The structure is compared with the solution structure of the lipoyl domain of the A. vinelandii 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. The overall fold of the two structures, described as a P-barrel-sandwich hybrid, is very similar. This agrees well with the high similarity of NMR-derived parameters, e.g. chemical shifts, between the two lipoyl domains. The main structural differences between the two lipoyl domains occur in a solventexposed loop close in space to the lipoylation site. Despite their high structural similarity, these lipoyl domains show a high preference for being reductively acylated by their parent 2-0x0 acid dehydrogenase. Potential residues of the lipoyl domain involved in this process of molecular recognition are discussed. Keywords: protein structure ; NMR; pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ; acetyltransferase ; molecular recognition.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) catalyses the irreversible overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (for a recent review see Mattevi et al., 1992a). This multienzyme complex plays an important regulating role in the aerobic catabolism of carbohydrates, where it links glycolysis with the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes from Gram-negative bacteria are composed of multiple copies of three enzymic components ; pyruvate dehydrogenase (Elp), dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2p) and lipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). The structural core of these complexes consists of a cubic assemblage of 24 E2p chains arranged with octahedral symmetry. The E l p and E3 components are tightly but non-covalently bound to the E2p core as dimers. The 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC), which occurs in the citric acid cycle, belongs to the same family of 2-0x0 acid dehydrogenase complexes as the PDHC, as do the branched-chain 2-ox0 acid dehydrogenase complexes. These complexes all have similar structural and catalytic properties.

The chain of the acetyltransferase component (E2p) of PDHC from A. vinelandii is, like other E 2 components, highly segmented. It consists of five independently folded domains that are separated by long stretches (25-40 amino acids) of polypeptide chain which are flexible and unusually rich in alanine and proline residues (Hanemaaijer et al., 1988). From the N-terminus, the E2p chain consists of three highly similar lipoyl domains (about 80 residues) that each contain one covalently bound lipoic acid prosthetic group, a peripheral subunit-binding domain (about 35 residues), and a catalytic domain (29 kDa) which accommodates the acetyltransferase active site and is responsible for the formation of the core of the complex (Hanemaaijer et al., 1987). The lipoyl domains attached to the flexible linkers fulfil an indispensable role in coupling the three separate enzyme activities in the multienzyme complex (Reed, 1974). The single oxidised lipoyl group of each lipoyl domain, which consists of 11poic acid bound in an amide linkage to the side chain of a specific lysine residue, becomes reductively acetylated by pyruvate, catalysed by E l p . The acetyl group is delivered at the active site of E2p to form acetyl-CoA, after which the lipoyl domain visits the active site of E3 where it becomes re-oxidised. The threedimensional structure of the lipoyl domain is required for the efficient reductive acetylation of its lipoyl group by E l p (Graham et al., 1989). Moreover, lipoyl domains can only be efficiently reductively acylated by an E l of their parent complex (Graham et al., 1989), which indicates that molecular recognition occurs between E l components and lipoyl domains. So far any 2-0x0 acid dehydrogenase complex or any of its acyltransferase components refused to crystallise to an appreciable resolution, most likely caused by the high flexibility of their lipoyl domains a n d o r linkers. Therefore, we have undertaken, among others, the approach of structure determination of the individual components and the separate domains of the acyltransferase component of these large multienzyme complexes.

plexes, this has resulted in the unique crystal structure of the catalytic cubic core domain of E2p (Mattevi et al., 1992b, 1993), the crystal structure of lipoamide dehydrogenase (Schierbeek et al., 1989; Mattevi et al., 1991) and the solution structure of the single lipoyl domain of OGDHC (Berg et al., 1996a). The solution structures of the lipoyl domain of Bacillus stearothermophilus PDHC (Dardel et al., 1993), an inactive hybrid lipoyl domain from Escherichia coli (Green et al., 1995), and the peripheral subunit-binding domains of dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (E20) of E. coli OGDHC (Robien et al., 1992) and of E2p of B. stearotherrnophilus PDHC (Kalia et al., 1993) have also been solved. No structural information on any E l component is yet available. In this paper, we describe the determination of the threedimensional solution structure of the N-terminal lipoyl domain of A. vinelandii PDHC. We have recently reported the subcloning, overexpression, 'H and 15N NMR assignments and secondary structure of this lipoyl domain (Berg et al., 1994), as well as a comparison of NMR-derived parameters with those of the lipoyl domain of A. vinelandii OGDHC (Berg et al., 1995). From this study, it became clear that the overall fold of the PDHC and OGDHC lipoyl domains must be very similar. This implies that the observation that lipoyl domains are only efficiently reductively acylated by the E l component of their parent complex is a result of subtle differences between the lipoyl domains. The aim of this work is to gain a better understanding at the atomic level of this process of molecular recognition by comparing the three-dimensional structures of both lipoyl domains. Furthermore, elucidation of the structure of the PDHC lipoyl domain provides the basic structural information for the design of significant mutants to investigate the specific interaction of this domain with E l , and provides naturally a further step in the completion of the three-dimensional structure of the entire pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex from A. vinelandii.

ambiguous. The standard pseudoatom corrections (Wuthrich et al., 1983) were applied to methyl groups, degenerate diastereotopic hydrogen atoms and diastereotopic hydrogen groups, for which only one NOE was observed. For stereospecifically unassigned diastereotopic substituents for which NOEs to both hydrogen atoms were observed, the distance geometry algorithm for NMR applications (DIANA) treatment of diastereotopic hydrogen atoms was used (Giintert et al., 1991). In cases where both NOEs had an equal upper distance limit, no pseudoatom correction was applied. In cases where both NOEs had different upper distance limits, the upper distance limit of both NOEs was set equal to the higher limit of the two, and an extra DIANA pseudoatom distance constraint was calculated and added to the constraint list. Backbone dihedral angle constraints were derived from 'J,,, coupling constants measured in a 'H-"N HMQC-J spectrum, as described in Berg et al. (1995). The dihedral angles were constrained to - 120( ? 30)" for 'JHNrZ 9 Hz, to a -120(?40)" for 'JHNa 8-9 Hz and to -55(?30)" for 'JHNII of values smaller than 6 Hz. Stereospecific resonance assignments of methylene C ' s protons and valine residue methyl groups values [from double-quantum filtered were obtained from 3J(1fi correlation spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) and exclusive correlation spectroscopy (E. COSY) spectra] and relative intra-residue NOE intensities (Wagner et al., 1987; Zuiderweg et al., 1985). The derived x1 angles were constrained to one of the three rotamers -60, 180 or 60", with a range of t 30". Hydrogen-bond constraints were included only in the later rounds of structure calculations, in a conservative way. A hydrogen-bond constraint was defined only if (a) the amide proton had been shown to exchange slowly in 'H-15Nheteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments of a freshly prepared lipoyl domain sample in 'H,O, (b) the hydrogen bond was present in the majority (>90%) of the calculated structures and (c) the hydrogen bond was present in regular antiparallel @-sheet and between backbone atoms onlyd Two constraints were used for each bydrogen bond, 1.5-2.3 A for the NH-0 distance and MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.5-3.3 A for the N-0 distance.

The structures were then gradually cooled (50-K steps) to 100 K over 75 ps, while increasing the weight of the repulsive Bruker AM600 spectrometer, with 256(t,)X96(t2, "N)X 1024(t,) points and a NOESY mixing time of 100 ms.

straints (derived from 13 hydrogen bonds), and 66 dihedral angle angles). The NOE distance conconstraints (53 and 13 straints comprised 156 intra-residue, 161 sequential, 38 shortrange (1 < li-jl<5) and 119 long-range constraints (Ii-jla5). The distribution of distance constraints (NOEs plus hydrogen bonds) along the amino acid sequence is shown (Fig. la). The absence of any aromatic residues in the lipoyl domain results in a relatively poor chemical shift dispersion in the NMR spectra, in particular in the aliphatic regions of the spectra. Therefore, a number of NOEs remained ambiguous, even after several rounds of structure calculations. For example, a number of resonances could be assigned belonging to a certain amino acid residue, but their exact position in the side chain could not be determined unambiguously (Berg et al., 1994). Despite thorough inspection of the NMR spectra, including a three-dimensional NOESYHMQC spectrum, the number of unambiguous long-range NOEs that could be identified was relatively low. This also seems inherited with the particular type of protein structure (Dardel et

x,

al., 1993; Green et al., 1995; Berg et al., 1996a). Many longrange contacts between hydrophobic residues in the core of the domain are side-chain- side-chain contacts. The unambiguous assignment of many of these contacts is impaired by overlap, and these contacts will only be accessible after I3C-labelling of the lipoyl domain. A total of 50 structures was generated using ab initin simulated annealing in X-PLOR, and of these, 29 structures were selected based on experimental constraint satisfaction criteria only. These structures show no distance constraint violations > 0.2 A and no dihedral angle violations > 1' (Table 1). A view of a best fit superposition (using backbone atoms of residues 1-73) of the 29 simulated annealing structures is shown (Fig. 2). In combination with Fig. l b , showing the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the 29 structures from the mathematical average structure for backbone and all heavy atoms as a function of the residue number, it can be seen that the structures show reasonable convergence. The last six residues at the C terminus are poorly defined, and exclusion of these residues results iq rmsd values of the ensemble from themean structure of 0.87 A for backbone heavy atoms and 1.27 A for all heavy atoms (Table 1).For the disordered C-terminal residues, no nontrivial NOEs could be observed. It is noteworthy that the linewidth of the NH resonances from the C-terminal residues is con-

siderably narrower than those from residues of the rest of the lipoyl domain (Berg et al., 1994), implying a higher mobility for these residues. A Ramachandran plot for all 29 structures in the ensemble is depicted in Fig. 3. Most non-glycine residues lie within the sterically allowed regions (Morris et al., 1992). The six C-terminal residues show backbone dihedral angle (+ and t) combinay tions in all regions of the Ramachandran plot, and have consequently very poorly defined angles (average Svn@ < 0.5 ;Hyberts et al., 1992). The only non-glycine residue showing a positive 4 angle is Glu29. This residue lies in the generously allowed region, and has reasonably high angular order parameters (S+ = 0.86, Sw = 0.96). For Glu29 no dihedral angle constraint was coupling constant of 6-8 Hz was meaapplied since a 3JHNa sured. Furthermore, a very strong intra-residue NH-C"H NOE was observed for this residue. Both these observations are con-

Description of the structure. The ensemble of 29 structures representing the solution structure of the N-terminal lipoyl domain of A. vinelandii PDHC is shown in Fig. 2. A schematic representation of the minimised average structure is illustrated in Fig. 4. The overall fold of the lipoyl domain can be described as a p-barrel-sandwich-hybrid (Chothia and Murzin, 1993). The domain is an all-p-sheet protein, and consists of two very similar four-stranded antiparallel P-sheets with three major strands and one minor strand each, that are formed around a core of hydrophobic residues. One p-sheet (sheet A) is formed by the pstrands S1, S3, S6 and S8, and the other /I-sheet (sheet B) is formed by the strands S2, S4, S5 and S7, with p-strands S3 and S7 being the minor strands. The p-strands are alternated and connected by loop regions and turns adopting no regular repetitive secondary structure. In one of the sheets the successive strands S4 and S 5 are connected by a type-I p-turn comprising residues Ser37 -Ala40. The turn holds the lipoyl-lysine residue Lys39 at position 3, which has been proved to be the crucial position for this residue to become lipoylated (Wallis and Perham, 1994). The strands S1 and S2 are connected by a short five-residue loop (Pro7-Glyll) which is solvent exposed and lies in the vicinity of the lipoylation site. This loop contains a non-classical tight turn of type ay (Wilmot and Thornton, 1990). The two minor strands (S3 and S7) are both surrounded by small loop regions that each contain a type-I1 /3-turn, and that link them to the larger strands. The four turns all show a small (<6 Hz) 'JHNU coupling constant for residues at position 2 and slow amide-proton exchange for residues at position 4 (Berg et al., 1994, 1995). The lipoyl domain displays a remarkable internal symmetry with a twofold rotational axis. The two halves of the molecule (residues 103-36 and residues 50-73) align with an rmsd of only 0.72 A for backbone atoms after rotation of approximately 180" about this axis. This symmetry seems conserved in all lipoyl domains. The core of the lipoyl domain is formed mainly by hydrophobic side chains of residues of the two P-sheets. Sheet A

contributes eight residues (Ile4, Va16, Ile26, Va152, Va155, Ile69, Ile70 and Leu72), and the sheet B contributes seven residues (Va115, Leul8, Leu32, Va133, Leu35, Val44 and Leu63) to the hydrophobic core. In addition, the side chains of three residues (Va120, Pro47, Va157), which reside in regions connecting the /3-strands, protrude into the core, and these residues show hydrophobic contacts to core residues in both sheets. The absence of aromatic residues in the hydrophobic core is remarkable and unusual, but seems to have no effectual consequence for the stability of the domain. Most residues in the core have a welldefined side-chain conformation (Fig. l a ) and a low side-chain solvent accessible surface (Fig. 1c). The six C-terminal residues of the subcloned fragment are disordered and are not involved in the global fold of the domain. These residues belong to the first mobile Ala+Pro-rich linker sequence separating the N-terminal lipoyl domain from the second lipoyl domain in the E2p chain.

DISCUSSION
Lipoyl domains are essential for the optimal functioning of the 2-0x0 acid dehydrogenase complexes. By acting as substrate-carrying domains, they couple the activities of the three enzyme components in the multienzyme complex. Being coupled to the flexible linkers, the lipoyl domains are capable of moving rapidly from active site to active site while keeping substrate diffusion limited and thus increasing the local substrate concentration significantly. The lipoyl domains with their covalently coupled lipoyl group are, as such, a substrate for all three enzyme components in the complex. With the lipoyl group in the oxidised form, the lipoyl domain is a substrate for the E l component, in the acylated form a substrate for the E2 component, and in the reduced form a substrate for the E3 component. The structure of the lipoyl domain not only provides a specific point of attachment for the lipoyl group but, interestingly,

enhances the reaction efficiency with the E l component dramatically (10000 times); (Graham et al., 1989). Free lipoamide, as well as a lipoylated decapeptide with an amino acid sequence identical to that found surrounding the lipoylation site of E. coli PDHC lipoyl domains, are extremely poor substrates for E l . Although free lipoamide proves a good substrate for the E2 and E3 components, it cannot be ruled out that attachment of the protein domain to the lipoyl group also increases the reaction rate with these components. Recently, an indication of such an enhancement for the E3 reaction has been reported in a paper by Ravindran et al. (1996). Furthermore, the structure of the lipoyl domain is also responsible, at least in part, for the specificity of the reductive acylation reaction with the E l component. Lipoyl domains are only being efficiently reductively acylated by the E l component of their parent complex. This means, for the A. vinelandii and E. coli complexes, that PDHC lipoyl domains are a good substrate for E l p but not for 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (Elo), and that OGDHC lipoyl domains are only a good substrate for E l o and not for Elp. Specificity of E2 components for their lipoyl domains has not been reported but seems not likely, since lipoyl domains can be selected by the E2 component on the basis of the acyl-group that is bound to the lipoyl group. Considering that PDHC and OGDHC share a common E3 component, specificity is not involved in the reaction of lipoyl domains catalysed by E3. Thus, the three-dimensional structure of the lipoyl domain is very important because it is responsible for both an efficient and a specific reaction of the bound lipoic acid prosthetic group with the E l component. This is remarkable since the reactive dithiolane ring of this prosthetic group is at the far end of the long lipoyl group and protrudes into the solvent. Several solution structures of lipoyl domains have recently been described. These are the PDHC lipoyl domains from B. stearothermophilus (Dardel et al., 1993) and E. coli (Green et al., 1995), and the OGDHC lipoyl domain from A. vinelandii

(Berg et al., 1996a). In addition, the X-ray crystal structures of the sequentially and functionally related lipoylated H-protein of the glycine decarboxylase system from pea leaves (Pares et al., 1994), and the biotinyl domain of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase from E. coli (Athappilly and Hendrickson, 1995) have been determined. The general fold of all these domains/proteins is similar and has been described as a new class of all /I-sheet proteins called P-barrel-sandwich hybrids, and is thought to be typical for proteins containing a lipoyl or biotinyl group. The solution structure of the lipoyl domain of A. vinelundii PDHC, described in the present study, is no exception and adopts a similar overall fold. Many of the common structural features of lipoyl domains and related proteins, such as the topology and arrangement of the /I-strands, the hairpin turn containing the lipoylated or biotinylated lysine residue, and the internal twofold symmetry, have been reviewed earlier in different papers describing these structures. We will concentrate here mainly on the comparison of the structures of the A. vinelandii PDHC and OGDHC lipoyl domains, for reasons outlined below. A comparison of the secondary chemical shifts and other NMR-derived parameters (such as 'J,,, coupling constants and NH-exchange rates) between the PDHC and OGDHC lipoyl domain presented earlier (Berg et al., 1995), indicates that there are no major structural differences in solution between the two

domains. A comparison of the structures of the PDHC and the OGDHC lipoyl domain, together with their superposition, is shown (Fig. 5). It is immediately clear that the two structures are strikingly similar. All secondary structure elements, as well as the far majority of residues forming the hydrophobic core, are highly conserved (Fig. 6). The positions of the /I-strands in both structures are very similar, including the occurrence of four classic /I-bulges within them. The positions of the four type-I1 turns surrounding the two small /I-strands, and the position of the type-I turn that holds the lipoyl-lysine residue, are also equivalent. The minimised average PDHC and OGDHoC lipoyl domain structures overlay with an rmsd of only 1.5 A for c " atoms (residues 1-6, 12-73 for PDHC, residues 1-6, 15-76 for OGDHC), despite the relatively low sequence identity of 25 %. It is clear from the structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 6) that the second and the third lipoyl domain of PDHC (Av-p2,3) will have highly similar structures to the N-terminal PDHC lipoyl domain, which is of course expected on the basis of their high sequence conservation and their identical function in the same multienzyme complex. In all lipoyl domains known so far, a strictly conserved aspartic acid residue precedes the lipoyl-lysine residues, with the single exception of the N-terminal lipoyl domain of A. vinelundii PDHC (this study), where an
