Abstract Human 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) are potential drug targets since they regulate the occupancy and trans- activation of steroid hormone receptors by interconverting potent hormones with their cognate inactive metabolites. The human isoforms (AKR1C1-4) are all members of the aldo /keto reductase superfamily and display distinctive differences in steroid specificity and catalytic efficiency when compared with the closely related and more extensively studied rat 3a-HSD (AKR1C9). Specifically, AKR1C1-4 display 3a-, 17b- and 20a-HSD activities to varying degrees whereas AKR1C9 is positional- and stereo-specific for the 3a-HSD reaction. In addition, AKR1C1-4 isoforms have significantly lower catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) than AKR1C9 and this is largely due to a lower kcat. To understand these functional differences, human type 3 3a-HSD (AKR1C2) was studied as a representative human 3a HSD. Comparison of the crystal structure of AKR1C2 /NADP ' /ursodeoxycholate ternary complex (3.0 A) with that  of the AKR1C9 /NADP ' /testosterone ternary complex (2.8 A) demonstrates the expected conservancy in overall structure and active site topology. More interestingly, it reveals striking differences in the structure of the steroid binding pockets of the two enzymes and shows how ursodeoxycholate binds `backwards' and `upside-down' with respect to testosterone. This difference in steroid binding provides a structural basis for the broad positional specificity of AKR1C2 and the exquisite stereospecificity of AKR1C9. To determine why AKR1C2 has a much lower kcat than AKR1C9, the events associated with the binding of cofactor to both enzymes were studied by steady state fluorescence titration and stopped-flow experiments. Comparable Kd values for E /NADP(H) and kobs values for the fluorescence transients were obtained for the two enzymes. These data are consistent with both enzymes binding NADP(H) in a conserved manner which is supported by the available crystal structures. The results suggest that cofactor binding or release for the human and rat 3a-HSDs are similar and do not account for the observed differences in kcat.

1. Introduction Aldo /keto Reductases (AKR) involved in steroid hormone metabolism include the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) and the steroid 5breductases [1 /3]. These enzymes belong to the AKR1 family of the AKR superfamily. The HSDs are unique in their ability to interconvert potent steroid hormones with their cognate inactive metabolites, and may have the capacity to regulate the occupancy and trans -activation of steroid hormone receptors in steroid target tissues. Rat liver 3a-HSD (AKR1C9) is the most thoroughly characterized HSD in the AKR superfamily. Because of its high sequence identity with other HSDs of the superfamily, structure /function relationships for AKR1C9 are considered pertinent to the other members. The homogeneous recombinant AKR1C9 (Mr 37 029) can be obtained in milligram amounts from overexpression in E. coli [4,5]. It catalyzes an ordered bi/bi reaction in which cofactor binds first and leaves last. It transfers the 4-pro-R -hydride ion from the cofactor to the 3-ketosteroid substrate [6]. The enzyme utilizes a conserved catalytic tetrad of Y55, K84, H117, D50, where Y55 is the general acid /base [7]. And, crystal structures exist for the apoenzyme, the binary complex and the ternary complex [8 /10]. There are four human 3a-HSD isoforms, which are AKR1C4 (type 1 3a-HSD, chlordecone reductase and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 4); AKR1C3 (type 2 3a-HSD/type 5 17b-HSD and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase X); AKR1C2 (type 3 3a-HSD, bile acid binding protein and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 2); and AKR1C1 (20a(3a)-HSD and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase 1) [11 /17]. Unlike the rat 3a-HSD which is positional and stereospecific, the human isoforms show functional plasticity. Extensive in vitro characterization of these recombinant enzymes led to the discovery that AKR1C1-AKR1C4 have 3-, 17- and 20ketosteroid reductase activity and 3a-, 17b- and 20a-hydroxysteroid oxidase activity in different ratios [18]. Thus the enzymes have the capacity to regulate the amount of active androgens, estrogens and progestins. When this is coupled with tissue

distribution studies putative roles for these enzymes in steroid hormone action become evident. AKR1C4 (Type 1 3a-HSD) is virtually liver specific and because of its high kcat/Km for dihydrosteroids it likely works in concert with 5a-reductase and 5b-reductase in the hepatic clearance of steroid hormones and bile acid biosynthesis [18]. AKR1C3 (Type 2 3a-HSD) has a kcat/Km that favors 17-ketosteroid reduction over 3-ketosteroid reduction and functions as a peripheral 3a(17b)-HSD [19,20]. It reduces D4-androstene-3,17-dione to testosterone and estrone to 17bestradiol and, therefore, makes active androgens and estrogens. AKR1C2 (Type 3 3a-HSD) has a kcat/Km for 3-ketosteroids which is 50-fold less than AKR1C4. Its preference to act as a 3ketosteroid reductase and as a 3a-hydroxysteroid oxidase suggests that it acts as a peripheral 3aHSD [18,21,22]. Importantly, it can interconvert 5a-dihydrotestosterone with 3a-androstanediol (3a-diol) in the prostate and may regulate occupancy of the androgen receptor. In addition, this enzyme has been implicated in the formation of allopregnanolone in the CNS. Allopregnanolone is an allosteric effector of the GABAa receptor, and is an anxiolytic steroid [23]. AKR1C1 (20a(3a)HSD) has a high kcat/Km for 20-ketosteroid reduction and is a candidate for the major human 20a-HSD that inactivates progesterone [18]. Significant unanswered questions that exist for the human isoforms are: (1) what is the structural basis for their functional plasticity; and (2) why is kcat 50/200-fold less for the human enzymes when compared with the rat enzyme. These questions have been addressed by determining the x-ray crystal structure of a human isoform (AKR1C2) and by examining the transient kinetics associated with cofactor binding, often considered a ratedetermining step in AKRs.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Recombinant proteins Homogeneous recombinant AKR1C1 / AKR1C4 were purified from E. coli as described [17].

2.2. Crystal structure of AKR1C2 Crystals of the AKR1C2/NADP ' /ursodeoxycholate complex were grown by vapor diffusion.  A complete data set was obtained at 3.0 A resolution and the structure was solved by the molecular replacement using the structure of the AKR1C9 /NADP' /testosterone complex as the search model. The final crystallographic and free R values were 22.3% and 27.8%, respectively [24]. 2.3. Stopped-flow spectroscopy Stopped-flow traces were obtained on an Applied Photophysics spectrometer with a dead-time of 1 /2 ms. One syringe contained a fixed concentration of AKR1C9 or AKRC2 and the other syringe delivered varying concentrations of NADP(H). The protein was excited at 290 nm and the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured using a 320 nm cutoff filter or the increase in the energy transfer band at 450 nm was measured using a 450 nm band-pass filter. Fluorescence kinetic transients were fit to either mono- or bi-exponentials.

3. Results 3.1. Steroid recognition in AKRs Homogeneous human AKR1C1 /AKR1C4 display different ratios of 3-, 17- and 20-ketosteroid reductase activity [18]. Bimolecular rate constants for the preferred reactions are shown in Table 1. Values for the reduction of 5a-dihydrotestosterone by rat 3a-HSD (AKR1C9) are shown for comparison. The catalytic efficiencies for the preferred reactions are 5/20-fold less than AKR1C9, and apart from AKR1C4 the catalytic efficiency for 3ketosteroid reduction is reduced by 100-fold across isoform. Existing crystal structures of the highly related AKR1C9 predicts that each of the human enzymes will have the (a/b)8-barrel motif of AKRs [9,10]. Furthermore, it is predicted that the cofactor will lie across the core of the barrel and that it will interact with 21-highly conserved amino acid

residues. Steroid ligands will lie perpendicular to the cofactor, and the reactive center would be in close proximity to the catalytic tyrosine. These features suggest that in order for these highly related enzymes to act as 3-, 17- and 20-ketosteroid reductases it is the position of the steroid hormone that must change in the structure. To catalyze 17-ketosteroid reduction it is predicted that the steroid hormone must present its C17-ketone to the catalytic Tyr and, therefore, the ligand must bind backwards (D-ring in the A-ring position) relative to testosterone in the structure of the AKR1C9 /NADP' /testosterone complex. In addition, so that a 17b-hydroxysteroid is produced the steroid must present its a-face to the cofactor, therefore, the ligand must also bind upside-down (b-face inverted) relative to testosterone in the AKR1C9/NADP ' /testosterone complex, Scheme 1. To catalyze 20-ketosteroid reduction it is predicted that the steroid hormone must present is C20-ketone to the catalytic Tyr and, therefore, the ligand must bind backwards (D-ring in the A-ring position) relative to testosterone in the AKR1C9 / NADP ' /testosterone complex, however, facial inversion of the steroid is unnecessary. To obtain evidence for these predictions we sought to solve the crystal structure of the AKR1C2 /NADP ' / ursodeoxycholate complex. 3.2. Crystal structure of human type 3 3a-HSD (AKR1C2) The crystal structure of human type 3 3a-HSD / NADP ' /ursodeoxycholate complex was solved  at 3.0 A resolution [24]. Concurrently, the structure of the type 3 3a-HSD /NADP' /testosterone  complex was solved at 1.25 A [25]. Of the two structures the former is more informative in explaining the functional plasticity of the human isoforms. As predicted the (a/b)8-barrel motif is observed and in the ternary complex, NADP ' and ursodeoxycholate bind perpendicular to each other. Importantly, the C24 carboxylate of the bile acid lies in close proximity to the catalytic Tyr (Y55) ' which has partial TyrOH2 character and this provides a counterion for the carboxylic acid

anion. Other interactions are that the 7b-hydroxy group of ursodeoxycholate forms a hydrogen bond with Y24. In addition V54 and V128 form hydrophobic interactions with the C18 and C19 angular methyl groups of the steroid, while W227 interacts with the C- and D-rings of the bile-acid. When the orientation of ursodeoxycholate in AKR1C2 is compared with that for testosterone in the AKR1C9 structure it is apparent that the Dring is in the A-ring position. Thus in AKR1C2, ursodeoxycholate is bound backwards relative to

testosterone. This `backwards' binding mode is facilitated by interactions with the C-terminal loop residues. Substitution of Y310 in the AKR1C9 structure with I310 prevents clashing of this hydrophobic residue with the C17 side-chain which now occupies the D-ring position, Fig. 1A. When the orientation of ursodeoxycholate in AKR1C2 is compared with that for testosterone in the AKR1C9 structure it is apparent that the angular methyl groups are now inverted. Thus in AKRC2, ursodeoxycholate is bound upside-down

relative to testosterone. W227 plays a large role in this mode of binding since it rotates 1208 versus its position in the rat structure, i.e. it functions as a `swing-door'. Also, the interactions of V54 and V128 with the angular methyl groups contribute to this mode of binding, Fig. 1B. Thus ursodeoxycholate in the AKR1C2 structure assumes the position of a 17-ketosteroid substrate, it is bound `backwards and upside'. By contrast, the AKR1C2/NADP ' /testosterone complex is less informative. In this structure the A-ring of testosterone is not buried deep-enough into the pocket to permit an interaction between the C3-ketone with either the catalytic Y55 or the C4-position of the nicotinamide ring. Instead, an acetate molecule occupies the oxyanion hole, Fig. 2. In addition, the C3-ketone is now on the wrong face of the steroid to act as a hydride acceptor since testosterone is also bound upside-down relative to its position in AKR1C9 complex with its angular methyl groups inverted. Again this occurs because W227 is now rotated 1348 versus its

position in the AKR1C9 structure. Thus the structure of AKR1C2 /NADP' /testosterone represents an abortive complex that does not predict 3a, 17b- or 20a-HSD activity. It does show that non-productive binding of steroid ligands occurs and this could contribute to the low kcat values observed. 3.3. Comparison of Kd values for NADP(H) binding to the human and rat 3a-HSD Isoforms. Why is kcat so low for the human isoforms Human 3a-HSD enzymes have kcat values that are 50 /200-fold lower than that seen for AKR1C9. In several AKRs, it is the release of NADP ' from a tight complex that is ratedetermining [26,27]. This rate is governed by k4 in the two-step binding model, Scheme 2. The isomerization event of E /NADP' to E* / NADP ' is accompanied by a fluorescence kinetic transient. Similar transients have been observed for the binding of NADP ' to AKR1C9, but the

rate constant for the slow release of cofactor k4 (11 s (1) was one order of magnitude greater than kcat. Thus the release of cofactor is not rate-determining in this instance [28]. In AKR1C9 the fluorescence kinetic transient was also abolished by the R276M mutant, where R276 provides an electrostatic anchor for the 2?-phosphate of AMP [28]. The crystal structure of the AKR1C2/ NADP' /ursodeoxycholate complex reveals that the binding mode of the cofactor in AKR1C2 closely resembles those reported for the complexes of AKR1C9. The residues involved in the interactions are highly conserved with the exception of D280 in the human enzymes which forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the adenine ring of the cofactor. It was suggested that these hydrogen bonding interactions, which are absent in the AKR1C9, may slow down the rate of cofactor release from the human enzyme [25]. Initially we examined the binding of the cofactor to AKR1C2 by measuring the steady state quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the protein. AKR1C2 was chosen as a representative human isoform because of the available crystal

structure. It also contains the same three tryptophans as AKR1C9 (W86, W148 and W227). Kd determinations in the steady state indicated that NADP(H) bound with similar affinity to AKR1C2 and AKR1C9. Thus no change in binding affinity was evident in the two enzymes, Table 2. 3.4. Fluorescence kinetic transients for AKR1C9 and AKR1C2 reveal a second slow step We next measured the fluorescence kinetic transients associated with cofactor binding using AKR1C9 (control) and AKR1C2. In replicating our earlier work we obtained evidence that the kinetic transients may best fit a bi-exponential rather than a mono-exponential. This was seen for the binding of NADP ' in which the decay in fluorescence was measured at 320 nm and for the binding of NADPH in which an increase in the energy transfer band at 450 nm was monitored. Further, evidence for the bi-exponential fit comes from the examination of the residuals, Fig. 3. For the bi-exponentials the kobs for the fast phase and the kobs for the slowest phase showed saturation

kinetics, and gave kmax values (limiting rate constant), Fig. 4. The kmax for the fast and slow phase exceeded kcat for AKR1C9. This phenomenon supports a three step binding model in which the loose E /NADP(H) complex undergoes two sub-

sequent isomerization events to yield E** / NADP(H), Scheme 2. Subsequently, the binding of NADP(H) to AKR1C2 was also monitored under stoppedflow conditions. Again the binding of the oxidized and reduced cofactor fit better to a bi-exponential rather than a mono-exponential. Plots of kobs for the fast and slow phases again showed saturation kinetics and the kmax values calculated. The kmax values were less than 5-fold lower than those observed for AKR1C9, Table 3, and, therefore, do not account for the 50-fold decrease in kcat observed in this enzyme. Our data support the concept that a step after cofactor binding is rate-determining in the rat and human 3a-HSD isoforms. This event could be steroid binding or the chemical event. We favor the later for AKR1C9 since we have measured the transient kinetics of testosterone binding to this enzyme. Binding of testosterone to the E** / NADPH complex quenches the energy transfer band and provides an estimate of the Kd for this competitive inhibitor. Stopped-flow studies show that this occurs within the dead-time of the spectrometer indicating that the binding of testosterone is diffusion controlled. In AKR1C9, testosterone is bound in close proximity to the catalytic Tyr and assumes the orientation of a 3-ketosteroid substrate, therefore, the binding and release of steroid substrate is not considered rate-determin-

Stopped-flow fluorescence kinetic transients were measured at 320 nm for the binding of NADP' to AKR1C2 and fit to biexponentials. The kobs for the fast and slow phase reach plateaus at high concentrations of the cofactor, which supports a three step binding model.

ing. Similar stopped-flow studies cannot be conducted for the binding of testosterone to AKR1C2 since the energy transfer band observed upon binding NADPH is absent.

4. Discussion Our studies enable us to make comparisons between the structure /function properties of the rat 3a-HSD (AKR1C9) with the human type 3 3aHSD (AKR1C2). The rat enzyme has a high kcat and kcat/Km and is positional and stereospecific. The binding of first ligand can be measured as a fluorescence kinetic transient that is dictated by cofactor anchoring and may be best fit to a three step binding model where kmax for the fast and slow events do not approach kcat. The slowest phase may reflect the movement of residues on the b1-a1 loop and loop B to form a cofactor tunnel, Scheme 2. In addition competitive inhibitors such as testosterone bind in a catalytically competent position so that the 3-ketosteroid is in close proximity to the catalytic tetrad. By contrast human AKR1C2 is representative of the four human 3a-HSD isoforms. It has a low kcat and kcat/Km versus AKR1C9 and the majority of the difference is in kcat. AKR1C2 is not positional and stereospecific since it also has 17and 20-ketosteroid reductase activity. This plasticity is explained by the available crystal structure of the AKR1C2 /NADP' /ursodeoxycholate complex, where the steroid is bound `backwards and upside-down' and assumes the position of a 17b-HSD substrate. The cofactor binding site is conserved in AKR1C9 and AKR1C2 and, there-

fore, it is not surprising to observe that NADP(H) is bound to both enzymes with similar affinities, and the three step binding model for cofactor applies to both enzymes. Two events could account for the low kcat of the human enzymes. It could be non-productive steroid binding as seen in the AKR1C2 /NADP' / testosterone complex or in the chemical event. We speculate that the low kcat is due to the incorrect positioning of the ketosteroid substrate to participate in hydride transfer and that it is due to steroid `wobble' at the active site.
