Abstract The ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is one of various ubiquitin-like modifiers and conjugates to target proteins in cells through Uba5 (E1) and Ufc1 (E2). The Ufm1-system is conserved in metazoa and plants, suggesting its potential roles in various multicellular organisms. Herein, we analyzed the solution structure and dynamics of human Ufm1 (hsUfm1) by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Although the global fold of hsUfm1 is similar to those of ubiquitin (Ub) and NEDD8, the cluster of acidic residues conserved in Ub and NEDD8 does not exist on the Ufm1 surface. 15N spin relaxation data revealed that the amino acid residues of hsUfm1 exhibiting conformational fluctuations form a cluster at the C-terminal segment and its spatial proximity, which correspond to the versatile ligandbinding sites of Ub and other ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls). We suggest that Ub and other Ubl-modifiers share a common feature of potential conformational multiplicity, which might be associated with the broad ligand specificities of these proteins. ” 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Covalent modification of cellular proteins with ubiquitin (Ub) occurs in eukaryotic cells and regulates a vast array of biological processes including protein degradation, cellcycle control, stress response, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation [1]. Eukaryotes express a set of molecules called ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) that have structural similarities to Ub. Ubl proteins can be divided into two classes: the type-1 Ubls (e.g., SUMO and NEDD8) are ligated to target molecules in a manner similar, but not identical, to the ubiquitylation pathway, while type-2 Ubls (also called UDPs, ubiquitin-domain proteins, e.g., Rad23, Parkin, and HOIL-1) contain a ubiquitin-like structure embedded in a variety of different classes of large proteins with apparently distinct functions [2≠8]. Ub and type-1 Ubls are conjugated covalently to the target substrate(s)

by isopeptide linkage between their carboxyl termini and amino groups of lysine residues of acceptor molecules [3,4,9,10]. Recently, a novel type-1 Ubl, which shares 16% sequence identity with Ub, was identified and termed Ufm1 [11]. While Ub and many Ubls possess the conserved C-terminal di-glycine that is adenylated by each specific E1 or E1-like enzyme, respectively, in an ATPdependent manner, Ufm1(1-83) possesses a single glycine at its C-terminus, which is followed by a Ser-Cys dipeptide in the precursor form of Ufm1. The C-terminally processed Ufm1(1-83) is specifically activated by an E1-like enzyme, Uba5, and then transferred to its cognate E2-like enzyme, Ufc1. The Ufm1-system is conserved in metazoa and plants but not in yeast, suggesting important roles in various multicellular organisms. However, the molecular mechanism of the Ufm1-system on structural basis is still unknown except for the NMR (nuclear magnetic

resonance) structure of protein ZK652.3, the Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of hsUfm1 (ceUfm1) [12]. Additionally, although three-dimensional (3D) structure data of Ubl proteins have been reported [6,7,13,14], little is known about conformational dynamics of these proteins, which is generally considered to be an important factor for our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in molecular recognition [15≠18]. So far, 15N spin relaxation data have been reported only for Ub and the Ubl domain of human DC-UbP, a type-2 Ubl, but not for type-1 Ubls [19,20]. Here, we report the solution structure and 15N spin relaxation data of the C-terminally processed human Ufm1. This information provides the basis for molecular recognition by this protein. Materials and methods
Protein expression and purification. The DNA fragment encoding human Ufm1(1-83) was cloned into pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL) to encode the N-terminal GST fusion protein and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 CodonPlus(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Uniformly 15N- and 13C/15N-labeled proteins were produced and purified as described previously [11] with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were grown in M9 minimal media containing [15N]NH4Cl and/or [13C6]glucose according to standard protocols. GST-fused protein was purified from cell lysate using a glutathione≠Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). After cleavage with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences), GST was removed by the application of the digested products onto a second glutathione≠Sepharose column. Further purification of the protein was carried out by gel-filtration column. The samples for NMR experiments were prepared at a concentration of 0.2 mM in 90% H2O/10% D2O (v/v), 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, and 100 mM NaCl at pH 6.0. NMR measurements and spectral analysis. NMR experiments were performed at 303 K using JEOL JNM-ECA920, Bruker Avance 600, and DMX-500 spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple-resonance probes. Backbone assignments were obtained with HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH experiments [21,22]. Side chain assignments were derived from HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and 15 N-edited TOCSY experiments [23]. Hydrogen bond restraints were obtained from 1H-15N-HSQC spectra by hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction in 99.9% D2O. NOE restraints were obtained from 1H-1H NOESY, 15N-edited NOESY, and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. The 15N longitudinal spin-relaxation rates (R1) were measured with relaxation delays of 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 ms. The 15N transverse relaxation rates (R2) were obtained with 15N 180∞ CPMG pulses at total relaxation delays of 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, and 240 ms. For R2 measurements, temperature-compensating 15N 180∞ pulses were applied during the recycle delay. 15N{1H} NOEs were obtained by interleaving pulse sequences with and without proton saturation. The time domain data were processed with nmrPipe software package [24]. Semiautomatic assignment of the resonance peaks of each amino acid residue was carried out using the Olivia software (http://fermi.pharm.hokudai.ac.jp/olivia/). Relaxation data were analyzed with Modelfree 4.1 [25] and FASTModelfree [26]. Structure calculations. Backbone dihedral angle restraints for / and u were created by using TALOS [27]. NOE assignments and structure calculation were performed by CYANA2.0 [28]. Each hydrogen bond was represented by two distance upper limit restraints (N≠O and HN≠O) to preserve linear bond geometry. A total of 100 random structures were calculated and the 10 lowest target function structures were selected to represent the 3D structure of Ufm1. The calculated structures were validated using the PROCHECK-NMR software [29]. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Accession Code 1WXS).

Results and discussion Solution structure of Ufm1 The final structure of hsUfm1 was calculated with total of 723 distance restraints, 38 hydrogen bonds information, and 100 backbone dihedral angle restraints (Table 1). The resulting root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) from the ∞ mean structure for backbone atoms was 0.571 A, which was sufficient to determine the overall structure of hsUfm1. A stereo view of the structure thus obtained is shown in Fig. 1. HsUfm1 assumes a ubiquitin-fold in which Lys3Thr9 (b1), Val20-Pro24 (b2), Ser47-Thr51 (b3), and Glu73-Pro78 (b5) form b-strands, while Pro29-Glu39 (a1) and Ala63-Lys69 (a2) form a-helices. In a typical Ub fold, b3 and a2 are connected by a short b-strand (b4), which is ambiguous in the Ufm1 structure, probably because two glycine residues (Gly54 and Gly56) in the corresponding segment preclude the formation of a stable b-strand. The structure of b1≠b2 loop (residues 16≠23) was not converged due to insufficient NOE constrains. The hydrophobic core of hsUfm1 is formed with Phe6, Ile8, Leu10, Leu21, Val23, Phe29, Val32, Leu33, Phe40, Val45, Ile49, Ile50, Ile57, Val66, Phe67, Leu74, and Ile76. While ceUfm1 has a non-conservative Pro-substitution of Thr at position 62 in hsUfm1 and elongated sequences at both N- and C-terminal regions, its structural feature is similar to that of hsUfm1. The surface electrostatic potential of hsUfm1 is markedly different from those of Ub and NEDD8 (Fig. 2). The most striking feature in hsUfm1 is the non-existence of the cluster of the acidic residues of the a1 surface displayed by Ub and NEDD8. It has recently been reported that the deep grooves between b2-strand and a1-helix of Ubls are subjected to protein≠protein interactions [30,31]. It is possible that Ufm1 employs the uncharged surface to bind its putative partner(s).

Conformational dynamics of Ufm1 To characterize the solution dynamics of hsUfm1, three 15N spin relaxation parameters (longitudinal relaxation rate R1, transverse relaxation rate R2, and 15 N{1H} NOE) were measured for individual backbone amide groups. From the model-free analysis, the order parameters S2 and the exchange contribution Rex were computed (Fig. 3). The residues in the N-terminal b1strand (Lys7 and Ile8), the a1≠b3 loop (Val42, Ala44, Ala45, and Thr46), and the C-terminal b5-strand

(Arg75 and Ile77) of hsUfm1 displayed higher (>10 s¿1) Rex values. In addition, the residues located in the b1≠b2 loop (Thr9-Tyr18) exhibited significant broadening of 1H-15N HSQC peaks, indicating conformational fluctuation in this region. Variable pressure NMR analyses revealed that Ub undergoes conformational fluctuations at the a1≠b3 loop and the C-terminal segment at 3 kbar, although such phenomena were not observed at normal pressures [32]. It has been reported that within the structure of the type-2 Ubl of DC-UbP, residues showing higher R2 values (also high R2/R1) form

a cluster on the surface area that is distinct from the region showing the conformational fluctuation in hsUfm1. These data suggest that Ub and type-1 but not type-2 Ubls share a common feature of (potential) conformational multiplicities, which are more pronounced for hsUfm1. The amino acid residues exhibiting higher Rex values form a cluster in the C-terminal segment and its spatial proximity of hsUfm1. Accumulating evidence indicates that Ub and Ubls perform versatile protein-protein interactions using the corresponding region, the so-called ``the Ile44 surface'' [33]. The biological functions of Ub and Ubls are mediated by interactions with their acceptor proteins containing the UBA, UIM, CUE, GAT, and/ or NZF motifs, which bind the Ile44 surfaces of Ub and some Ubls [6,7,33≠41]. The crystallographic data of NEDD8-Appbp1/Uba3, SUMO-Sae1/Sae2, and YUH1ubiquitin aldehyde complexes indicate that Ub and Ubls also interact with E1 and de-ubiquitinating enzymes as well as their cognate enzymes through the Ile44 surface and C-terminal segments [42≠44]. Conformational fluctuations of the ligand-binding sites of Ub and type-1 Ubls are intriguing because they might be associated with broad ligand specificities of these proteins. Further systematic studies on solution structure and dynamics of type-1 and type-2 Ubls could provide structural basis for molecular recognition of these unique classes of proteins.
