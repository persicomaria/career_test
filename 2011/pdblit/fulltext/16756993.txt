Abstract Human lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is thought to contribute to the oxidation of glyoxylate to oxalate and thus to the pathogenesis of disorders of endogenous oxalate overproduction. Glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR) has a potentially protective role metabolising glyoxylate to the less reactive glycolate. In this paper, the kinetic parameters of recombinant human LDHA, LDHB and GR have been compared with respect to their affinity for glyoxylate and related substrates. The K m values and specificity constants (K cat/K M) of purified recombinant human LDHA, LDHB and GRHPR were determined for the reduction of glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate. K M values with glyoxylate were 29.3 mM for LDHA, 9.9 mM for LDHB and 1.0 mM for GRHPR. For the oxidation of glyoxylate, K M values were 0.18 mM and 0.26 mM for LDHA and LDHB respectively with NAD+ as cofactor. Overall, under the same reaction conditions, the specificity constants suggest there is a fine balance between the reduction and oxidation reactions of these substrates, suggesting that control is most likely dictated by the ambient concentrations of the respective intracellular cofactors. Neither LDHA nor LDHB utilised glycolate as substrate and NADPH was a poor cofactor with a relative activity less than 3% that of NADH. GRHPR had a higher affinity for NADPH than NADH (K M 0.011 mM vs. 2.42 mM). The potential roles of LDH isoforms and GRHPR in oxalate synthesis are discussed. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Glyoxylate is a two carbon acid produced by the metabolism of glycolate and other unidentified sources. It is a highly reactive substance and at least two enzymes, alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) and glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR), are present in the hepatocyte which are able to metabolise glyoxylate to less toxic intermediates. Inherited deficiency of either of these enzymes leads to the metabolism of excess glyoxylate to oxalate with clinical sequelae characteristic of the primary hyperoxalurias (reviewed by [1]).

tate dehydrogenase (LDH) is proposed to have a major role in oxalate production from glyoxylate (Fig. 1) particularly in situations of endogenous overproduction [2]. However, no kinetic data are available describing the relative affinity for glyoxylate of GRHPR and the different isoenzymes of LDH preventing any assessment of their relative roles in vivo. LDH is a tetramer composed of LDHA and LDHB subunits and somatic cells contain heterotetramers formed from combinations of these subunits in different proportions. LDHA is particularly abundant in skeletal muscle and liver while LDHB is the major form in cardiac muscle. A third isoenzyme, LDHC, is expressed in spermatozoa and testis only [3]. The proteins are encoded by three different genes which map to different chromosomal locations, LDHA and LDHC to chromosome 11; LDHB to chromosome 12 [4,5].

Fig. 1. Reactions catalysed by LDH and GRHPR. Schematic showing the reactions catalysed by LDH and GRHPR as measured in this study. Note that GRHPR, unlike LDH, can also utilise NADPH as a co-factor.

The three human LDHs have 84 ≠89% sequence similarities and 69 ≠75% amino acid identities [6]. However, in spite of this, they have been reported to have different substrate specificities and selective inhibitors of LDHA4 and LDHB4 have been described [7]. However, crystallographic analyses have shown the active sites of both forms to be identical, leading to the proposal that the distinctive catalytic properties results from electrostatic effects of residues peripheral to the active site [8]. The enzymes are regarded as cytosolic although there is some evidence that LDHA is also found in the mitochondria [9], where it may play a role in intracellular lactate metabolism. Others have disputed the mitochondrial localisation [10] and no mitochondrial targeting sequence has yet been identified. The role of LDH, and in particular the individual isoenzymes of human LDH, LDHA and LDHB, in glyoxylate metabolism has never been formally documented nor has its interaction with glyoxylate reductase (GRHPR). Glyoxylate reductase is also primarily cytosolic with a minor component in the mitochondrion [11] with the bulk of enzyme activity located in the liver [12]. The enzyme also has hydroxypyruvate reductase and d-glycerate dehydrogenase activities (Fig. 1) although conditions for the latter appear to be unfavourable in the cell. Cloning and expression of the GRHPR gene [13,14] has enabled detailed kinetic analysis of the human enzyme, deficiency of which is known to underlie primary hyperoxaluria type 2 (PH2). In this disorder glyoxylate normally metabolised to glycolate by GRHPR is available for oxidation by LDH.

In this paper, we compare the kinetic properties of recombinant human LDHA, LDHB and GRHPR with glyoxylate to investigate the most likely primary route of disposal of cytosolic glyoxylate.

2. Materials and methods All chemicals were of Analar grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK unless otherwise stated. Expression plasmid pEZZ-18 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Chalfont St. Giles, UK) and JM109 competent cells from Stratagene (Cambridge). LDHB cDNA Image Clone ID 2961445 was obtained from I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (http://menu.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/) and human LDHA cloned into pKK223-3 vector as previously described [15]. Custom-made oligonucleotides were obtained from Genosys (Genosys Biotechnologies, Pampisford) and Taq polymerase from Promega (Southampton). 2.1. Expression and purification of recombinant human LDHA Recombinant human LDHA in the pKK223-3 vector was expressed without induction as previously described [15]. Crude enzyme extract was prepared by suspending cells in 20 mM phosphate buffer containing Bugbusteri (Novagen, Madison, USA) protein extraction reagent (10%v/v). The

extract was clarified by centrifugation at 3000¬g for 60 min and the supernatant applied to a Q-sepharose column (15 cm ¬ 1.6 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5). Under these conditions, the enzyme did not bind to the column. Those fractions containing the highest enzyme activity were applied to a Cibacron Blue-3-FGA column (5 mL bed volume) equilibrated with buffer A. LDHA was eluted from the column with 5 mM NADH in buffer A and dialysed overnight against buffer A. 2.2. Cloning, expression and purification of recombinant human LDHB The full length cDNA clone of human LDHB was amplified by PCR using primers designed to introduce restriction sites for EcoR1 and BamH1 at the 5V and 3V ends respectively (forward 5V GAATTCAATGGCAACTCTTAAGGAAAAC, reverse 5VGGATCCGTCACAGGTCTTTTAGGTCCTTC). The PCR product was ligated into the expression plasmid pEZZ-18 which had been previously treated with BamH1 and EcoR1 and the cut ends dephosphorylated. The construct pEZZ-18-LDHB was transfected into JM109 competent cells. Single colonies of transfected cells were grown overnight in SOB media containing 50 Ag/mL ampicillin. Recombinant LDHB was expressed without IPTG induction and purified by methods used for the purification of LDHAwith the exception that cation exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose) was substituted for Q-Sepharose. 2.3. Expression and purification of recombinant human GR/ HPR Recombinant human GRHPR in the pTrcHisB vector was expressed as previously described [13]. Enzyme extract was prepared by suspending cell pellets in buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl, followed by four sonication and freeze ≠thaw cycles of three 10-s bursts followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing at 37 -C. The extract was centrifuged and the supernatant applied to a nickel column (Probond, Invitrogen) which was washed with Buffer A containing 500 mM NaCl. Bound enzyme was step eluted from the column with imidazole (50 mM ≠ 500 mM in buffer A) followed by overnight dialysis against buffer A. 2.4. Protein determination Protein was measured by absorbance at 280 nm and quantitatively with the Petersen modification of the Lowry assay [16]. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as standard. 2.5. Enzyme assays Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring change of absorbance at 340 nm in a Uvikon spectrophotometer fitted with a thermostatically regulated cuvette holder set at

37 -C. All assays were carried out in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 in a final reaction volume of 1 mL. Substrate stock solutions were prepared fresh in the same buffer and kept at 4 -C until required. For monitoring purification reactions, LDH activity was measured with 1 mM pyruvate and 0.15 mM NADH; GRHPR activity was assayed with 2 mM glyoxylate or 1 mM hydroxypyruvate and 0.15 mM NADPH. An extinction coefficient of 6220 M¿1 cm¿1 was used to calculate units of enzyme activity as Amoles of NADH or NADPH consumed per minute. Enzyme concentrations were typically 12 nM. 2.6. Determination of kinetic parameters A two-substrate approach, in which the 2 substrates were simultaneously varied, was adopted for the determination of all enzymes used in the study. Assays were carried out in triplicate using the conditions described above. For reduction reactions, hydroxypyruvate (concentration range 0.02 mM ≠ 0.070 mM) and glyoxylate (0.125 mM ≠ 20 mM) were used in the presence of NADH or NADPH (0.00625 mM ≠0.3 mM) for LDHA, LDHB and GRHPR. Pyruvate (0.0625 mM ≠ 2 mM) was also used as substrate for LDHA and LDHB. For oxidation reactions lactate, glyoxylate and glycolate (0.125 mM ≠ 20 mM) were used in the presence of NAD+ (0.125 mM ≠ 5 mM) to determine the kinetic parameters for oxidation reactions catalysed by LDHA and LDHB. 2.7. Data analysis Data from the above experiments were analysed by two methods; the Leonora curve fitting program (version 1.0) [17], which generates the ``true'' kinetic parameters from the experimental data, and SigmaPlot version 8.0 which determines the ``apparent'' kinetic parameters for each substrate concentration. The slopes of primary plots of Fa/v_ against Fa_ (first substrate) provided values of maximal reaction velocity app (1/V app). Secondary plots of 1/V app and K M /V app against the reciprocal of the second substrate then enabled the determination of the ``true'' kinetic parameters, K MA and K MB and V max. Calculation of K cat (V max/[E]) depended on protein concentration measured by Lowry assay [16].

3. Results Using the purification protocols described above, all enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity as shown by single bands on a Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2). 3.1. Kinetics The primary and secondary plots for the reduction and oxidation of glyoxylate by LDHA are shown in Fig. 3. Similar plots were obtained for LDHB. Fig. 4 shows the

up to 0.3 mM) as substrates. Under the conditions described, the specificity constant of LDHB for hydroxypyruvate was approximately 5 times greater than LDHA. GRHPR catalysed reduction of both glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate with either NADH or NADPH as cofactor (Fig. 4 and Table 1). The enzyme displayed differential affinities for the two cofactors (K NADPH 0.011 mM vs. M K NADH 2.42 mM) and the overall reactions (specificity M constants) indicate that hydroxypyruvate is turned over more efficiently in both cases. Substrate inhibition was evident with GRHPR in the presence of increasing amounts of hydroxypyruvate and either NADH or NADPH (Fig. 4c) and concentrations had to be lowered to 0.07 mM and below to obtain kinetic data (Fig. 4d).

reduction of glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate by GRHPR. The kinetic parameters derived from these data are summarised in Table 1. In all cases comparable results were obtained by either curve fitting or secondary plots. Based on specificity constants, the decreasing order of substrate catalysis for recombinant human LDHA and LDHB is pyruvate > hydroxypyruvate > glyoxylate for the reduction reactions. For the oxidation reactions, LDHA and LDHB displayed similar specificity constants for glyoxylate and lactate. Neither LDHA nor LDHB utilised glycolate (concentrations up to 10 mM) nor NADPH (concentrations

4. Discussion It has been postulated for some years that LDH plays a role in the production of oxalate from glyoxylate and is a major contributor to the increased oxalate output seen in the primary hyperoxalurias. Most studies have used purified or unpurified preparations of human and animal tissue LDH containing a mixture of isoenzymes that may not be relevant for liver specific diseases like PH2. Liver predominantly expresses the LDHA isoform with a small

amount of LDHA3B1 [9]. We therefore felt it was appropriate to analyse the individual human LDH isoenzymes for their activity with glyoxylate and related substances and to compare these results with those of the GRHPR enzyme which is believed to have a protective role in preventing the accumulation of cytosolic glyoxylate. This is the first study in which the characterisation has been based on purified, recombinant forms of each of these human enzymes. Analysis of the kinetic parameters for LDHA and LDHB with their primary substrates pyruvate and lactate gave the

results expected from previous studies with the purified human enzyme. The K M values for pyruvate with LDHA and LDHB (0.17 mM and 0.063 mM, respectively) agree closely with those previously reported which used a pH range from 6 to 7.5 [8,15,19,20]). The K M values for lactate for both LDH isoenzymes were higher than those for pyruvate confirming other reported data for human LDHA and LDHB [19,21] and ovine corneal epithelium LDH [22]. However, it should be noted that the current study differs from these earlier studies where all measurements were made at higher pH values (9.2 ≠9.5), corresponding to the

maximal activity of the enzyme. In this study, we have found significant oxidative activity for LDH with glyoxylate as substrate at pH 7.5, in contrast to an earlier report [24] of little activity at this pH. We note the K M values for glyoxylate of approximately 0.2 mM for the LDH isoenzymes at pH 7.5 are about an order of magnitude lower than values reported at pH 9.1 (3 mM; rabbit LDHA, [34]) and pH 9.4 (2.5 mM; pig heart LDHB, [24]), similar to the variation of the K M for pyruvate with pH noted in [8]. Although the conditions used for the assays in this study may not directly match the physiological conditions encountered within the cytoplasm, in order to assess the comparative contributions of both LDH and GRHPR, we have used a consistent pH for all assays. The cofactor specificities of GRHPR and LDH were quite different. Human GRHPR showed a preference for NADPH, which has also been reported for the GRHPR enzyme from rat liver [23]. Consistent with previous studies, NADPH was found to be a poor substrate for both LDHA and LDHB, the relative activity with NADPH being less than 1% of that seen with NADH with hydroxypyruvate as substrate and less than 3% when glyoxylate was the substrate. A similarly low affinity for NADPH has previously been reported with porcine [24] and ovine LDH [22]. Crystallographic studies have shown that specificity for NADH over NADPH in dehydrogenases is usually achieved by the inclusion of an aspartic acid residue (Asp 51 in human LDHA, see reference [8]) in the pocket normally occupied by the 2V-phosphate group in NADPH-dependent enzymes. By contrast, selectivity for the phosphate group of NADPH arises from pairing with neighbouring positively charged (arginine and histidine) residues (as discussed by [25]). In the absence of both a crystal structure and reliable model for GRHPR, we can only assume that the preference of GRHPR for NADPH arises from a similar mechanism. We note this observed preference suggests that LDH is unlikely to compete with GRHPR for NADPH. The key reactions from the point of view of understanding the pathophysiology of the primary hyperoxalurias are those involving the metabolism of glycolate, glyoxylate and hydroxypyruvate. 4.1. Oxidation of glycolate Under the conditions used in this study, neither human LDHA nor LDHB catalysed the conversion of glycolate to glyoxylate despite the use of glycolate concentrations of up to 10 mM, results which agree with findings for rat liver LDH [26]. A recent report [27] stated that bovine heart and muscle LDH were able to oxidise glycolate, but reactions were performed at pH 9.0, the KM values were high (122 and 135 mM respectively) and reaction velocities low, indicating relatively low catalytic efficiencies for the two enzymes. Thus, this reaction is unlikely to be of any physiological significance in vivo.

4.2. Reduction of glyoxylate Both LDH and GRHPR can utilise glyoxylate as a substrate in reduction reactions. When NADH is used as a co-factor, under the same conditions both LDH and GRHPR show comparable overall activity for glyoxylate. Glyoxylate binds with tighter affinity to GRHPR (K M ®1 mM versus 10≠ 30 mM for the LDH isoenzymes) but the turnover number (k cat) is reduced by an order of magnitude (®70 s¿1 for GRHPR, ®700 s¿1 for LDH), leading to very similar overall specificity constants. In aqueous solution, glyoxylate has been shown to exist predominantly in its hydrated, gemdiol form [35], whereas the preferred substrate for reduction by LDH is the unhydrated form [18]. As the fraction of unhydrated glyoxylate is expected to be very low under the experimental conditions (approximately 0.0038, by analogy with [18]) the K M for (unhydrated) glyoxylate ≠ the true substrate ≠ will be considerably lower than the apparent values reported in Table 1. Consequently, the actual specificity constants for the reduction of glyoxylate will be higher than those calculated from the observed K M values. We estimate that applying a correction factor for the amount of unhydrated glyoxylate as suggested by [18] would lead to specificity constants for both LDH and GRHPR comparable to the values obtained for the reduction of pyruvate by LDH. Glyoxylate can also be reduced by GRHPR in the presence of NADPH as co-factor, whereas no significant activity was observed with both LDH isoenzymes with NADPH. Although NADPH binds to GRHPR with a K M value about two orders of magnitude tighter than does NADH, the overall specificity constants towards glyoxylate are comparable. This suggests there is no inherent preference for glyoxylate between LDH and GRHPR, and ≠ for the latter ≠ activity towards this substrate is equally efficient with either NADH or NADPH. The critical difference appears to lie with the inability of LDH to utilise NADPH as a co-factor. The higher proportion of NADPH relative to NADH in the cytosol, where the ratio of NAD+/NADH is approximately 1000:1, whereas the NADP+/NADPH ratio is 1:100 [31], is likely to favour reductive reactions that can utilise NADPH. 4.3. Oxidation of glyoxylate LDH, but not GRHPR, can also utilise glyoxylate as a substrate in an oxidative reaction to produce oxalate (Fig. 1). The measured K M and specificity constant values at pH 7.5 for these reactions are similar between the human LDH isoforms, and for the equivalent oxidative reaction of LDH with lactate. The pH optimum for the latter is known to be about 9.2, whereas we have conducted both the oxidation and reduction reactions at physiological pH for comparative purposes. Under these conditions, we note that the efficiency of the oxidative reaction for glyoxylate by LDH as measured by the specificity constant (30 ≠100 s¿1 mM¿1)

K. Mdluli et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1753 (2005) 209 ≠ 216

215

is very similar to the reverse, reductive reaction of this same substrate by both LDH (22 ≠ 75 s¿1 mM¿1) and GRHPR (67 s¿1 mM¿1). These data imply that control of the direction of this reaction is likely to be dictated by the ambient conditions within the cell, including the relative abundance of the respective substrates and NADPH levels relative to NAD+ supply. The ability of LDH to synthesise oxalate from glyoxylate has been documented in various species including porcine heart LDH [24], crude rat liver preparations [28] and rabbit LDHA [29]. These findings are in contrast to LDH from spinach leaves that were found to be inactive with glyoxylate in the oxidation reaction, i.e., oxalate synthesis was not possible [30]. Oxalate is a well-known inhibitor of LDH, suggesting that the amount of oxalate formed by this route may be self-limiting. Additionally, in normal situations, the cellular concentration of lactate is likely to be at least an order of magnitude greater than that of glyoxylate and hence would be expected to competitively inhibit binding of glyoxylate to the LDH active site. This leads us to conclude that, under cellular conditions, LDH is unlikely to be a major factor in oxalate synthesis when GRHPR is present. This conclusion is supported by the finding of normal urinary oxalate excretion in patients deficient in LDHA and LDHB [28]. 4.4. Reduction of hydroxypyruvate In PH2, deficiency of GRHPR is likely to lead to the accumulation of hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate. PH2 is also characterised by elevated levels of l-glycerate, believed to result from the LDH-catalysed reduction of hydroxypyruvate [36]. Our analysis shows that both LDHA and LDHB are able to catalyse this reaction. Although LDHB appears more efficient for the generation of l-glycerate (specificity constant 2100 s¿1 mM¿1 versus 430 s¿1 mM¿1 for LDHA) substantial activity is observed with both isoforms. A comparable level of activity is also observed for the generation of d-glycerate by GRHPR, noting once again that this reaction would be favoured under enhanced NADPH levels (specificity constant 340 s¿1 mM¿1 with NADH, and 660 s¿1 mM¿1 with NADPH). The absence of accumulation of l-glycerate in normal individuals suggests that the cellular conditions favour conversion of hydroxypyruvate by GRHPR rather than LDH. It has been previously proposed that reduction of hydroxypyruvate results in a shift in the NAD+:NADH ratio leading to conditions that favour the oxidation of glyoxylate by LDH [2]. However, it has also been found that hydroxypyruvate inhibits the oxidation of glyoxylate by LDH in vitro [24,32] and therefore the potential accumulation of hydroxypyruvate in PH2 may prevent LDH from converting glyoxylate to oxalate. Evidence has been presented for the auto-oxidation of hydroxypyruvate to oxalate [32] but the relevance of this reaction in vivo is unclear--it is certainly not the only means of metabolism of excess hydroxypyruvate as some of this is known to be metabolised to l-glycerate.

From inspection of the activity plots in the presence of increasing concentrations of hydroxypyruvate (Fig. 4c), it is evident that high levels of this substrate lead to inhibition of the enzymatic activity. A similar pattern of inhibition was observed whether NADPH or NADH was used as co-factor. The lack of linearity of secondary plots as a function of the reciprocal of the fixed substrate has been shown to be indicative of uncompetitive substrate inhibition [33]. This type of inhibition is a feature of dehydrogenase enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenases, that follow a compulsory order reaction mechanism [34] and is thought to arise from the formation of a dead-end abortive complex between the substrate and the enzyme-oxidised cofactor complex, before the release of the cofactor from the enzyme. In a study with rat liver GRHPR, substrate inhibition was observed with both hydroxypyruvate and glyoxylate but only when NADPH was used as co-factor [23]. The observation that GRHPR is also subject to substrate inhibition is consistent with the notion that GRHPR activity in vivo is regulated primarily by its surrounding cellular conditions, in particular through the ambient levels of both co-factors and potential substrates.

5. Conclusions In this study, we have determined initial kinetic parameters for recombinant human LDHA, LDHB, and GRHPR with substrates relevant to the pathology of primary hyperoxaluria type 2. The data suggest that competition between the reduction and oxidation of glyoxylate is finely balanced when the enzymes alone are considered under fixed conditions. Hence, at physiological pH, there is no significant, inherent preference for either reduction or oxidation of this substrate. However, the data are consistent with two important potential control mechanisms. Firstly, GRHPR displays similar levels of activity whether utilising NAD(H) or NADP(H), whereas LDH enzymes are strictly NAD(H) dependent. Levels of cytoplasmic NADPH are therefore likely to provide a critical switch for the dominance of GRHPR over LDH activity. Secondly, the observation that hydroxypyruvate acts as both substrate and substrate inhibitor for GRHPR, similar to excess pyruvate inhibition for lactate dehydrogenase, emphasises the propensity for these enzymes to be regulated by ambient concentrations of both their substrates and products. These studies highlight the need for a systems-based approach to understand the consequences of altered GRHPR levels in PH2 and related diseases.
