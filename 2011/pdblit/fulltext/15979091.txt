Abstract To determine if the CIRCE/HrcA system operates in cyanobacteria, we have inactivated the hrcA repressor gene in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by gene targeting. In the hrcA mutant, the groESL1 operon and the groEL2 gene, both of which have the CIRCE operator in their upstream regions, were derepressed at 30C without a¡ecting expression of other major heat-shock genes. However, expression of these groE genes in the mutant was not fully derepressed. Their transcription increased further upon heat shock, and was initiated from the same sites as those used under normal conditions. This suggests that their expression is regulated by at least two di¡erent mechanisms, a negative one controlled by HrcA and an unknown positive one. The heat-induced expression of clpB1 and htpG was greatly repressed by the absence of HrcA. The hrcA mutant which constitutively overexpressed GroEL displayed improved cellular thermotolerance and also reduced photobleaching of phycocyanin under heat stress conditions. ß 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic prokaryotes that are phylogenetically and physiologically related to the chloroplasts of photosynthetic eukaryotes. Cyanobacteria, like other organisms, synthesize a diverse range of heat-shock proteins (Hsps) upon exposure to high temperatures [1]. In order to demonstrate a speci¢c contribution of an Hsp in thermotolerance in cyanobacteria, disruption mutants of the clpB, hspA, and htpG genes have been constructed [2,3,4]. Interestingly, all of these disruptants showed far more striking thermosensitive phenotypes than those of Escherichia coli or other prokaryotes, suggesting that these Hsps have a particularly important role for photosynthetic prokaryotes. Constitutive overexpression of HspA confers thermotolerance and thermal protection of the photosynthetic apparatus in cyanobacteria [5], indicating an important role of a small Hsp in thermal stress management in photoautotrophic organisms. The regulation of the expression of cyanobacterial heatshock genes remains poorly understood. So far, two possible

cis-acting elements have been described in cyanobacteria. One of them is an AT-rich imperfect inverted repeat sequence located in the 5P-untranslated region of Synechococcus vulcanus hspA gene [6]. We detected a protein(s) which speci¢cally binds to this sequence. We postulated that the protein may control the transient expression of the hspA gene as a repressor, since the DNA-binding activity was transiently lost upon a heat-shock treatment of cells. The other cis-acting element is CIRCE (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression) [7]. Transcriptional start sites of the two heat-inducible groEL genes of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were mapped within CIRCE and were identical irrespective of the temperature treatment [8]. CIRCE is an inverted repeat consisting of 9 bp separated by a 9-bp spacer; it has been found in more than 40 di¡erent eubacterial species including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species [9], and shown to act as a negative cis-element of grpE/dnaK/dnaJ and/or groE operons [7,10,11]. hrcA (heat shock regulation at CIRCE elements) [12] encodes a negative regulator [12^14]. The HrcA repressor protein binds directly to CIRCE [13,15,16]; it thus acts as a repressor and CIRCE as an operator. In Bacillus subtilis [7], Caulobacter crescentus [12] and Bradyrhizobium japonicum [16], the hrcA gene is part of the dnaK operon and is heat inducible. Common to all regulatory systems involved in the heatshock response is the transient induction of heat-shock genes. This implies that, in the case of the CIRCE/HrcA system, HrcA has to be transiently inactivated, assuming that the system plays a major role in the transcriptional control of the genes with CIRCE. In B. subtilis, it has been proposed that the activity of HrcA is modulated by the GroEL chaperonin system [15]. According to the model, HrcA, which tends to aggregate, is maintained in an active conformation by GroEL. When stress conditions lead to increased formation of non-native proteins in a cell, GroEL is titrated by these proteins and is less available to activate HrcA than it is under normal conditions. This situation leads to the transcription of the genes. When more than enough GroEL accumulates to chaperone non-native proteins, it inhibits expression of the CIRCE-containing groE and dnaK operons. This model was challenged by Minder et al. [16] who noted that HrcA of B. japonicum was soluble and that DNA binding of the HrcA was not improved by the presence of either the GroE or DnaK chaperone machinery. Instead of GroEL, HrcA from Bacillus thermoglucosidansius was refolded and solubilized by DNA [17]. GroEL had only a minor e¡ect on preventing HrcA from aggregating when compared with DNA. In order to prove that the CIRCE/HrcA system operates in cyanobacteria, we used gene targeting to disrupt an open

A separate blot for each particular probe was hybridized at 70C as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche). After washing the membrane, the chemiluminescence signal from each probe was detected by exposing the blot for di¡erent time intervals to X-ray ¢lms. The size of mRNA was determined using an RNA ladder (Gibco/BRL). 2.4. Primer extension analysis Primer extension analysis was performed as described previously [21]. Synthetic oligonucleotides, 5P-TTTCACAGTAGAAACATTAATGGAAATAGC-3P and 5P-TCTGGATTCATCCTTAAAGGAAATAAG-3P, which are complementary to the region downstream of the transcriptional initiation site of groESL1 (nucleotides +81 to +110 from the transcription start site) and groEL2 (nucleotides +54 to +80), respectively, were labeled with [Q-32 P]ATP and used as a primer. Primer extension was carried out in 20 Wl bu¡er containing 2 pmol of the labeled primer, 10 Wg of total RNA, and 200 units of SuperscriptTM II RNase H3 reverse transcriptase (Gibco/BRL), and then stopped by the addition of 1 Wl of 0.5 M EDTA and 1 Wl of RNase A (10 Wg/ml). The extended products were electrophoresed in a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea sequencing gel. Products of dideoxynucleotide sequencing reactions performed with the same primer and a cloned groES- or groEL2-containing DNA fragment as a template were run in parallel to allow determination of the end points of the extension products. The DNA fragments which extend from 3299 to +355 (from the transcription start site) of the groES gene and from 3249 to +1188 of groEL2 were ampli¢ed with the Synechocystis genomic DNA as a template and the following primer sets, groE05 (sense) 5P-TCAAGCTCGTGAATGGTGAGAGG-3P and groE02 (antisense) 5P-GTTAACAGAACATAGTCGTCGC-3P, and cpn-3 (sense) 5P-ATGTCCAAGCTCTAGTGGATGC-3P and cpn-2 (antisense) 5P-CGACTTTAATCACAGCTACACC-3P, respectively. 2.5. Construction of mutants A region of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome containing hrcA was ampli¢ed by PCR with the P1 and P2 primers (5P-TAGGACGGCCATGGTAAGAT-3P and 5P-TACTAACCTGTTGCCTGGAG-3P, respectively). The PCR product was cloned in pT7Blue T-vector. The resulting plasmid DNA, pT7Blue-hrcA, contains a unique ApaI restriction site in the coding region of the hrcA gene. A kanamycin-resistant gene cassette was inserted into the restriction site in the forward direction (the same gene orientation as that of hrcA). The cassette was isolated by digesting pUC4K (Pharmacia) with PstI. The construct was used to transform cells of naturally competent Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 through homologous recombination, and these were segregated for a few generations by single colony selection on BG-11 agar plates to isolate mutant strains [22]. Twenty Wg/ml kanamycin sulfate was used for selection of transformants. Characteristics of one of the clones are presented.

reading frame (ORF) that encodes a HrcA homologue in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. As expected, the groESL1 operon and the groEL2 gene were derepressed in the mutant under normal conditions, while the CIRCE-lacking heat-shock genes were not. However, either heat shock or irradiation further activated the groE genes in the mutant, indicating that another level of control exists. Expression of the groE genes was transient in the mutant, indicating that HrcA-reactivation is not the sole mechanism for the feedback inhibition of the groE expression in cyanobacteria. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Organisms and culture conditions Unless otherwise indicated, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were grown at 30C under a light intensity of 30 WE/m2 /s in liquid BG-11 medium [18] or on BG-11 plates containing 1.5% (w/v) agar and 0.3% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate. The BG-11 was modi¢ed to contain 5 mM HEPES^NaOH (pH 8.0) and 50 Wg/ml Na2 CO3 . The liquid culture was bubbled with air. 2.2. Preparation of total RNA Cells in 15-ml liquid culture that had been incubated for di¡erent time intervals after shifting cultures from 30C to 42C were immediately collected by centrifugation and frozen in liquid N2 . During the incubation, the culture was illuminated and air-bubbled as described above. Alternatively, cells in 15-ml liquid culture were killed instantaneously by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 10% phenol in ethanol, collected by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid N2 [19]. Both methods gave similar results. Total RNA was extracted as previously described [20]. 2.3. Northern blot analysis Suitable fragments for the preparation of the clpB1-, clpB2-, htpG-, dnaK2-, groEL2-, groES- (to detect transcripts of the groESL1 bicistronic operon), hspA-, and rnpB-speci¢c probes for detection of the corresponding RNA from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were ampli¢ed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with genomic DNA as template and appropriate pairs of primers listed in Table 1. PCR products containing part of htpG, dnaK2, groEL2, or groES were cloned in either the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen) or pBluescript II SK (Stratagene), and linearized by digestion with an appropriate restriction enzyme. Digoxigenin-labeled complementary RNA was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. For the ampli¢cation of DNA fragments containing a portion of either clpB1, clpB2, hspA, or rnpB, an antisense oligonucleotide primer containing either T3 or T7 RNA polymerase promoter was used (Table 1). Thus, the PCR product was directly used for the synthesis of the digoxigenin-labeled RNA Table 1 Sequences of oligonucleotide primers used for probe preparation mRNA to be detected clpB1 (slr0156a ) clpB2 (slr1641a ) htpG (sll0430a ) dnaK2 (sll0170a ) groES (slr2075a ) groEL2 (sll0416a ) hspA (sll1514a ) rnpB

Protein extraction, sodium dodecyl sulfate^polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS^PAGE), and Western blot analysis Cells growing exponentially were harvested by centrifugation at room temperature and disrupted immediately to extract soluble proteins [6]. Equal amounts of the protein extract were boiled for 5 min in a mixture containing 50 mM Tris^HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 10% glycerol, and then loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS [23]. Western blot analysis was performed to detect GroEL and DnaK proteins by using anti-S. vulcanus GroEL and DnaK polyclonal antibodies as probes, respectively [23]. 2.7. Viability assays Cells were grown to mid log phase (an absorbance of 0.80 to 1.0 at 730 nm) at 30C under a light intensity of 30 WE/m2 /s. Twenty ml of the culture were incubated with continuous air-bubbling at 48C for 15 or 60 min under the same light intensity. Aliquots of the culture taken before and after the high-temperature treatment were diluted to an OD of 0.1 at 730 nm, and then serially diluted in fresh, sterile BG11 medium. A 10-Wl aliquot from each dilution was then spotted onto a BG-11 plate, and the culture was grown at 30C under a light intensity of 30 WE/m2 /s for 10 days. Cell survival was determined by counting the number of colonies in the most and second most diluted cultures and multiplying their average by the appropriate dilution factor.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. HrcA homologues and CIRCE in cyanobacteria To date, one ORF encoding a HrcA homologue has been found in each genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, or Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 when searched by Cyanobase (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/). The deduced primary sequences were aligned with HrcAs from other prokaryotes using Clustal W (data not shown). The similarity among HrcAs from various prokaryotes including cyanobacteria was restricted mainly to three previously described regions, Box A, Box B, and Box C [14]. In contrast to other bacteria, neither dnaK nor any other heat-shock genes such as grpE and dnaJ are located near the hrcA genes in Synechocystis and other cyanobacteria (Fig. 1A). Although there is a CIRCE element upstream of the hrcA genes from bacteria such as B. subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, and Chlamydia trachomatis, all the cyanobacterial hrcA genes lack CIRCE. This indicates that the cyanobacterial hrcA gene is not subject to autoregulation as it is in B. subtilis. So far, CIRCE has been identi¢ed in cyanobacteria around the transcriptional start site of groE only, but not near any of the multiple dnaK genes. Two distinct groEL genes generally exist in a cyanobacterial cell [24^26]. One gene, designated as groEL1, is co-transcribed with groES, while the other, groEL2 or cpn60, produces a monocistronic mRNA. CIRCE is not present upstream of all the groE genes. For example, the S. vulcanus groEL2 is not associated with CIRCE [25]. We aligned the 5P-upstream regions of groE genes from various cyanobacteria (Fig. 1B). The CIRCE sequence, TTAGCACTC-N9-GAGTGCTAA, is perfectly conserved among the groE genes. The groESL1 operons, from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, have transcription start sites at the same nucleotide, which is located within CIRCE (Fig. 3A and [27]). The groESL1 transcription started from the same site under normal and heat-shock conditions. In all the groESL operons, the consensus promoter sequences of the E. coli major sigma factor were identi¢ed just upstream of CIRCE, with the last two nucleotides of the 310

sequence overlapping with the ¢rst two nucleotides of CIRCE. Thus it is likely that the promoter for the groESL operon is recognized by the major sigma factor in cyanobacteria as in the case of other prokaryotes such as B. subtilis. We could not ¢nd any promoter sequences upstream of the transcription start site of the groEL2 gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that was identi¢ed by Glatz et al. [8] (Fig. 1B, see the nucleotide indicated by an asterisk). As shown in Fig. 3B, we found a di¡erent transcriptional start site for the groEL2 gene (the highlighted nucleotide), upstream of which the consensus promoter sequence was found. Most of the groEL2 promoter overlaps with CIRCE. We also found consensus promoter sequences that overlap with CIRCE upstream of the Anabaena groEL2 gene by a computer search for promoters (Fig. 1B). 3.2. Disruption of hrcA To analyze the role of HrcA in heat-shock gene regulation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, an ORF, sll1670, was disrupted by double crossover insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene cassette into the chromosome. Correct integration and complete segregation of the mutation in all the copies of the genome was con¢rmed by PCR. These results indicate that the gene is not essential under normal growth conditions. No detectable di¡erence in growth rates was observed at 30C (data not shown). The mutant cells grew similarly to the wild type during the exponential growth phase at 42C, but

60

slightly more cells accumulated than for the wild type after reaching the stationary phase. This may be indicative of a growth advantage for the mutant at a moderately high temperature. 3.3. Derepression of the groESL1 and groEL2 genes in the hrcA disruptant under normal growth conditions Consistent with the hypothesis that sll1670 encodes the HrcA repressor, the inactivation of the ORF led to derepression of groESL1 and groEL2 under normal growth conditions (Fig. 2A, 0 min; see also Fig. 3). The level of the GroEL protein was signi¢cantly elevated in the mutant grown under normal growth conditions (Fig. 2B, 0 min), con¢rming the results obtained by RNA analysis and further strengthening our conclusion that hrcA encodes a negative regulator of the cyanobacterial groE genes. However, disruption of hrcA had no marked e¡ect at 30C on expression of clpB1, clpB2, htpG, dnaK2, or hspA (Fig. 2A, 0 min). With the exception of clpB2, these genes are not transcribed signi¢cantly under normal conditions. This is in contrast to the constitutive rnpB RNA expression that was analyzed as a reference for the detection of heat induction. The level of DnaK did not change as a consequence of the lack of HrcA (Fig. 2B, 0 min). The upstream regions for these genes lack CIRCE element consensus sequences. Thus, the CIRCE/ HrcA system appears to be speci¢c to the groE genes, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other genes, not tested in the assay above, may also be regulated by this system. Previously, there was no transcriptional analysis on the heat induction of cyanobacterial clpBs. In the Synechocystis genome, there are two ORFs encoding ClpB homologues that are found in Cyanobase. In the present study, we examined transcription of both clpB1 and clpB2. As shown in Fig. 2A with the wild type cells, expression of clpB1 is dependent on heat shock, while that of clpB2 is constitutive. Thus, there is no possibility that the clpB1 probe also detects transcripts of clpB2 or vice versa, although the sizes for the two clpB mRNAs are similar. The induction patterns for the two clpB genes from Synechocystis are similar to those for the ClpB proteins from Synechococcus. The ClpB1 protein in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 is induced by heat shock, while the ClpB2 protein is a constitutive protein [28]. 3.4. Existence of another level of heat-shock control for the groESL1 and groEL2 genes The levels of groESL1 and groEL2 mRNAs (Fig. 2A) and the GroEL protein level (Fig. 2B) in the mutant cells were increased further by a heat-shock treatment at 42C. Thus, the expression of the two groE genes was not fully derepressed at 30C by disruption of hrcA, suggesting that another level of heat-shock control exists. This control is likely to play a major role in groE heat induction because of the great increase in the level of groE mRNA upon heat shock in the hrcA mutant. In order to precisely identify the transcriptional start sites from which derepressed and heat-induced transcriptions of both the groESL1 operon and the groEL2 gene took place, primer extension analysis with RNA from non-heat-shocked and heat-shocked Synechocystis cells was performed. Single transcriptional start sites for the groESL operon and the groEL2 gene were found 75 bp and 44 bp upstream, respectively, of the translational start codons in the wild type cells

Cells in a 70-ml culture growing at 30C under a light intensity of 30 WE/m2 /s were subjected to heat shock and 15-ml aliquots of the culture were collected at 15-, 30-, and 60-min intervals. 0.6 Wg (for the groESL1, groEL2, and hspA mRNA detection), 0.6 Wg (for the rnpB RNA detection), 1.7 Wg (for the clpB1 and clpB2 mRNA detection), 2.0 Wg (for the htpG mRNA detection), or 3.6 Wg (for the dnaK2 mRNA detection) of total RNA were used for Northern blotting. B: Time course for the accumulation of the GroEL and DnaK proteins. Cells in a 70-ml culture growing at 30C under a light intensity of 30 WE/m2 /s were subjected to heat shock and 15-ml aliquots of the culture were collected at 60-, 120-, and 180-min intervals. Either 10 Wg (for the GroEL detection) or 15 Wg (for the DnaK detection) of crude soluble proteins were separated by SDS^PAGE (16% acrylamide gel), and then GroEL and DnaK were speci¢cally detected by Western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against S. vulcanus GroEL and DnaK.

(Fig. 3A,B). Glatz et al. [8] also found single transcriptional start sites for groESL1 and groEL2, but theirs are di¡erent from the start sites we determined. The one for the groESL1 operon and groEL2 were located one base downstream and 27 bp upstream, respectively, of ours. Consensus promoter sequences are found upstream of the transcriptional start sites for groESL1 and groEL2 as determined here. The transcription of both groESL1 and groEL2 from the vegetative promoters overlapping CIRCE was clearly derepressed at 30C in the hrcA mutant (Fig. 3). Thus, our results strongly indicate that the transcription of groEL1 and groEL2 is repressed under normal growth conditions by the interaction of HrcA with CIRCE. As proposed in Bacillus, the groE genes in the wild type may be heat-induced (or derepressed) due to the inactivation of the HrcA protein under heat stress. However, there may be other mechanisms which control the cyanobacterial groE gene expression, as discussed above. The heat-in-

duced transcription in the hrcA mutant took place from the same start site as the one under normal conditions. A possible interpretation of the results is that heat stress activates transcription of the two groE genes by the RNA polymerase with the major sigma factor. The presence of multiple regulatory mechanisms for groE gene expression is further supported by the fact that the transcriptions of the groESL1 operon and the groEL2 gene in the hrcA mutant as well as the wild type are light-activated at a normal growth temperature (data not shown). The increase in the level of the groE transcripts upon a shift of cells from dark to light took place independent of HrcA.

3.5. E¡ect of the disruption of hrcA on the heat-induced expression of other major heat-shock genes Disruption of hrcA led to a strong inhibition of htpG and clpB1 heat induction, while it did not have any e¡ect on hspA induction (Fig. 2A). The mRNA accumulation of dnaK2 was slightly reduced in the mutant. The heat-induced accumulation of the DnaK protein appeared to be slightly slower in the mutant than the wild type. A likely interpretation of these results is that the enhanced cellular level of GroES and GroEL before heat shock represses the heat inductions of clpB1, htpG, and dnaK2. Interestingly, the clpB2 gene, whose mRNA level was constant in the wild type irrespective of the temperature treatment, was heat-induced in the hrcA mutant. This increase in the clpB2 expression may complement the decrease in the clpB1 heat induction in the mutant, although nothing is known about the underlying mechanism. 3.6. No major involvement of HrcA with the shut-o¡ of the groE transcription As described in the Introduction, HrcA has been proposed to be involved in the shut-o¡ of heat induction of the groE and dnaK operons in B. subtilis [15]. In Synechocystis, how-

ever, the absence of HrcA did not a¡ect the transient accumulation of the groE mRNAs (Fig. 2A). We con¢rmed the transient accumulation of groESL1 and groEL2 transcripts in the hrcA mutant as well as the wild type by measuring their mRNA levels up to 18 h (data not shown). After 18 h incubation at 42C, these transcripts in both the wild type and the hrcA mutant cells were reduced to a negligible level, although the time course of the mRNA level showed that the level decreases more slowly in the hrcA mutant than the wild type. These results indicate that HrcA does not play a major role in the transient accumulation of the groE mRNA in cyanobacteria. Shut-o¡ of groE induction in the absence of the HrcA repressor was also observed in B. subtilis [29]. As postulated by Homuth et al. [30], posttranscriptional regulation a¡ecting mRNA stability of CIRCE containing transcripts might be involved in the transient accumulation of the groE mRNAs. 3.7. E¡ect of the disruption of hrcA on the cellular thermotolerance and the thermal protection of the photosynthetic apparatus We tested whether the hrcA disruption would a¡ect the performance of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 under heat stress conditions. We analyzed the mutant's ability to survive a temperature upshift from the growth temperature of 30C to 48C, which is lethal to the wild type Synechocystis. As shown in Fig. 4, the hrcA disruption resulted in eight-fold and fourfold increases in the survival rate after the high-temperature treatment for 15 min and 60 min, respectively. In contrast to our present results, the hrcA deletion did not improve the heat tolerance of C. crescentus [12] or B. japonicum [16]. On the other hand, the hrcA mutant of B. subtilis acquired thermotolerance [13]. Minder et al. [16] suggested a possible reason for the discrepancy between B. subtilis, C. crescentus, and B. japonicum lies in the fact that C. crescentus, and B. japonicum hrcA mutants enhance only the concentration of GroE chaperonins, whereas the lack of HrcA in B. subtilis leads to an overexpression of both GroESL and DnaKJ/GrpE. Only increased level of the complete set of major chaperones would improve the capacity of bacterial cells to survive temperature upshift. However, in cyanobacteria, although the DnaK level is not changed under normal growth conditions, the hrcA disruption conferred the basal thermotolerance to cyanobacteria. Previously, we showed that phycocyanin is photo-bleached by a short heat-shock treatment of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 under weak light [5]. This photo-bleaching was greatly suppressed by a constitutive over-production of HspA in the cyanobacterium, indicating that the small Hsp can protect the light absorbing ability of phycocyanin under stress conditions. Similar to the small Hsp-overexpressing Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, the Synechocystis hrcA mutant was much more resistant than the wild type to the heat-induced photo-bleaching of phycocyanin (Fig. 5). A possible interpretation of these results is that GroE as well as small Hsp can protect phycocyanin from thermal photo-bleaching. We propose that di¡erent molecular chaperones may cooperate in the protection of phycocyanin and the phycobilisome complex.
