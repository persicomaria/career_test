1. iNTRODUCTION 1,n2 knowing the BMB for n1 - 1, n2 or n1 , n2 - 1. The procedure is the following. The indices of the BMB generated step by step when the index n2 decreases are determined; the same is done for the index nl at each step of n2. The BMB for n1 = n2 = U are calculated as well as the intermediate ones needed for the recursion relation which finally leads to the desired BMB. This procedure is carried through with the help of three vectors IC, IA and E. The odd elements of IC indicate the number of BMB generated for each value of n1 or n2 given by the next even element of IC. The maximum dimension reached in IC is MC. The elements of IA are grouped in sets of five elements. Each set describes the indices n', 1', N', L' respectivel and a number associated with the particular formula for the matrix element Knl,NL,xl -~~n'l',N'L',x) needed and to be defined below. The maximum dimension reached in IA is MAX. Finally, the vector E collects the intermediate BMB. The second element of E gives the required BMB. The maximum dimension of E is MC/2. rhe program uses a recursion relation to calculate Brody-Moshinsky Brackets (BMB) for any n

2. MATHEMATICAL METHOD The formulae coded in this program are described in ref. [lJ. (nl,NL,xIn1+1l1,n212,x)

The recursion relation used is:

(1) {(n1 +1)(n1 +li +~)]1/2 with the energy condition

n ,l ,N ,L' +11 +2n2 +12.

This formula enables one to calculate the BMB for n1 +l,n2 from the BMB for n ,n2 and matrix elements of -r~. The formulae for these matrix elements may be found in table 1 o~ ref. [lJ. Calculation of any BMB thus implies starting from the BMB for n1 = 0, n2 = 0 [1]: / ll!12! (21 + 1)(2L +1) (n +1)1 (N +L)! 11/2

3. PROGRAM STRUCTURE
The general flow diagram is illustrated by fig. 1.

The main program simply reads the input data Ni, N2, Li, L2, LA, N, L, NG, LG which stand for
the indices n 1, fl2, 11, 12, A, n, 1, N, L respectively of the BMB (ni,NL,Xjn1l1,n212, A)to be calculated. Subroutine BRODY calculates the required BMB. Communication between the main program and BRODY is established by the list

COMMON/BLOC2/BRNN, Ni, N2, Li, L2, LA, N, L, NG, LG where BRNN is the desired BMB. The flow diagram for this routine is shown in fig. 2. Subroutine BRNO (BRNN, IA2, LA, Li, L2, Ni, 0) calculates the BMB forn2 = 0; 1A2 is a vector of componentsn, 1, N, L. Subroutine INDIC (1A2, MAX, MC, LA, Li, L2, Ni, N2, IH, IA, IC) builds the two vectors IC, IA and calculates their maximum dimensions MC and MAX respectively. The quantity IH is given the value 1 or 2 if 1NDIC is called by BRODY or BRNO respectively. The flow diagram for ~NDIC is shown in fig. 3. Subroutine ISRIN (IA1, IB, K, LA, Li, L2, MH, MK) determines the necessary combinations of n', 1', N', L' starting from the input indices IA1 (n, 1, N, L); K gives the number of these combinations. The matrix lB contains the resulting indices n'l'N'L' and a number which refers to the special formula to be used for calculating the matrix element of -ri. The quantities MH and MK have values associated

with the origin of the CALL ISRIN i.e. either BRODY or BRNO, and serve to ensure the energy conservation rule. Subroutine FACT (CO, 1A2, LA, III) calculates the matrix elements of -r~or -r~. The result is given by CO. Communiration with the subroutine RACAH [2] is established by the 1is~I COMMON/BLNJR/RAC, JA, JB, JC, JD, JE, JF Subroutine BROO (ABRNO, 1A2, LA, Li, L2) computes the BMB for n 1 = = 0, the result being the quantity ABRNO. Communication with the subroutines RACAH and FACBIN are established through the list COMMON/BLOC1/FL(130)/BLNJR/RAC, JA, JB, JC, JD, JE, JF where the elements of the vector FL are the logarithms of the factorials calculated in FACBIN [2]. Subroutine COEF (Li, L, L2, LG, LX, A) computes the coefficient A given by eq. (3), the index LX corresponding to the index x in eq. (3). Subroutine FACBIN [2] calculates and stores the logarithms of the factorials required in the calculation. This subroutine is called, once for all, at the beginning of the main subroutine. Subroutine RACAH has been described in ref. [2]. In its present form, the program provides 200, 1000 and 100 locations for IC, IA and E respectively, which are sufficient for n1,n~ ~ 5. It is of course possible to increase these locations if necessary. 4. INPUT AND OUTPUT DATA All the input indices Ni, N2, Li, L2, LA, N, L, NG, LG necessary for the calculation of one BMB are integer quantities. These are transmitted to the main subroutine by the first COMMON field. The output data reproduce the above input indices and the corresponding BMB. In the present test run, the calculated BMB can be compared with those contained in ref. [2].
