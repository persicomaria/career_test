Nair1,3 Nisin is a posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptide that is widely used as a food preservative. It contains five cyclic thioethers of varying sizes that are installed by a single enzyme, NisC. Reported here are the in vitro reconstitution of the cyclization process and the x-ray crystal structure of the NisC enzyme. The structure reveals similarities in fold and substrate activation with mammalian farnesyl transferases, suggesting that human homologs of NisC posttranslationally modify a cysteine of a protein substrate.

he accelerated appearance of pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to the existing battery of antibiotics is a growing global health concern. This problem has prompted efforts toward the development of effective antibiotics with limited avenues for bacterial drug resistance. Attractive candidates are compounds with multiple modes of action, making resistance more difficult to develop. One example is nisin, a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptide that, despite worldwide use for decades in the food industry, has not induced widespread resistance (1). Nisin is highly effective Eminimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) on nM scales^ against a range of Gram-positive bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. It exerts its biocidal activity through both pore formation in the membrane and the disruption of cell wall biosynthesis by binding to lipid II, which is an essential intermediate in peptidoglycan biogenesis (2, 3). The targeted affinity for the bacterial cell wall increases the efficacy of nisin by several orders of magnitude compared with other pore-forming molecules, such

as the eukaryotic peptide magainin. In a third independent biological activity, nisin inhibits the outgrowth of bacterial spores (4). Although the biosynthetic gene cluster of nisin was sequenced in 1989 (5), to date, in vitro reconstitution of its biosynthesis and that of other class I lantibiotics has been unsuccessful. Furthermore, no structural information is available to provide insights into the molecular mechanism of biosynthesis. We present here the in vitro enzymatic synthesis of nisin A and the crystal structure of the cyclase enzyme that introduces the characteristic thioether rings that are essential for biological activity. The bacterial enzyme bears structural similarities with the b subunit of mammalian farnesyl transferases, and it appears to use an unusual integral protein module, similar in motif to Src homology 2 (SH2) and Gyf domains, for substrate binding. Nisin contains five thioether cross-links formed by the addition of cysteine residues to dehydroalanine (Dha) and dehydrobutyrine (Dhb) residues that originate from serine and threonine, respectively (Fig. 1A). These thioether structures are called lanthionines and methyllanthionines and are found in lantibiotics, a group of posttranslationally modified peptide antibiotics (6). The size of these rings in nisin varies from four amino acids for the B, D, and E rings to seven amino acids for the C ring. The cyclase enzyme NisC is believed to be responsible for the formation of all rings, but its activity or that of its homologs has not been demonstrated, and these proteins have no VOL 311 SCIENCE

sequence homology with any other functionally characterized proteins in the Swiss-Prot database. We cloned nisC from Lactococcus lactis EAmerican type culture collection (ATCC) accession number 11454^ and developed a high-level heterologous expression system in Escherichia coli. The substrate was obtained from an engineered L. lactis strain that secretes dehydrated prenisin peptide (7, 8). This strain contains a plasmid that harbors the nisA gene, which codes for the precursor peptide (prepeptide); the nisB gene, which produces the dehydratase that acts on the serine and threonine residues; and the nisT gene, which encodes the transporter that secretes the modified peptide (6, 8). Cells were grown on minimal media, and the secreted dehydrated prepeptide was precipitated from the spent medium with trichloroacetic acid and desalted. Analysis with mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis shows the expected molecular mass (Fig. 1B) and an estimated purity of 985%. Treatment of the dehydrated prenisin with the thiol modifying agent p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (PHMB) (9) after reduction of any disulfides with triscarboxyethyl phosphine (TCEP) demonstrates the presence of five free thiols (Fig. 1C). This treatment indicates that nisin is not present in this sample, because it would not have free thiols and should remain unmodified: No such peak is observed. Conversely, when the dehydrated peptide was treated with NisC followed by reduction with TCEP and reaction with PHMB, the product mixture showed a clear peak at 5715 daltons, which is associated with a peptide that is devoid of free cysteines as a result of five cyclizations (Fig. 1D). The removal of the leader peptide was achieved by treatment of the NisC product with substoichiometric concentrations of trypsin, resulting in a bioactive compound as shown by a clear zone of inhibition when spotted on a lawn of bacteria of the indicator strain L. lactis NZ9000 (fig. S1). When either NisC or trypsin treatment was omitted, no bioactivity was observed, corroborating the conclusion from Fig. 1, C and D, that cyclization is catalyzed by NisC. Mass spectrometric analysis of the product of successive NisC and trypsin action showed the expected peak for mature nisin (Fig. 1E). No peaks were observed for proteolysis after Lys12

Fig. 1. The posttranslational maturation process of nisin. (A) The prepeptide NisA is ribosomally synthesized, followed by dehydration of Ser and Thr residues to provide dehydroalanine (Dha, red) and Zdehydrobutyrine (Dhb, blue) residues. NisC then catalyzes the conjugate addition of Cys residues in a regio- and stereoselective manner to five of the Dha and Dhb residues to generate five cyclic thioethers, one lanthionine, and four methyllanthionines. The stereochemistry of the cyclization introduces the D-configuration at the newly formed stereogenic centers. After cyclization is complete, the leader peptide is proteolytically removed by the protease NisP. The sequence of the leader peptide is MSTKDFNLDLVSVSKKDSGASPR (35).

and Lys22. Similarly, no proteolysis occurs after these residues in dehydrated prenisin, presumably because of the structure of the adjacent posttranslationally modified amino acids. This result allows the use of trypsin to selectively remove the leader peptide from both cyclized and uncyclized peptide. After cleavage of the leader peptide from the dehydrated peptide,

NisC was unable to convert the dehydrated peptide into a bioactive substance (fig. S1), suggesting that the leader peptide fulfills a recognition role for NisC binding. This finding is consistent with published yeast two-hybrid results (10).

with 67% sequence identity with nisin (fig. S2), also converted the dehydrated prenisin into nisin, albeit less efficiently (fig. S1). SpaC and NisC have only 31% sequence identity. These results show that lantibiotic synthesis is modular, with dehydration and cyclization occurring independently, which is promising for protein engineering of either activity. The crystal structure of NisC was determined by multiple isomorphous replacements with anomalous scattering, solvent flattening, and phase combination (7). The structure of the native enzyme has been refined to a resolution of 2.5 ) (Rfree 0 24.2%; see table S1). A higher resolution data set has also been collected from crystals grown in the presence of lead acetate, ° and this structure has been refined to 2.2 A (Rfree 0 23.3%). The two structures are essentially identical except for the presence of residual lead ions in the latter structure. The overall fold has a di-domain architecture composed largely of a helices, with an extended domain defined by a short stretch of a helices and b sheets (Fig. 2A). The core structure consists of 14 a helices folded into two layers of a toroid (Fig. 2B). The inner layer consists of seven helices (a2, a4, a6, a8, a10,

a12, and a14) that are arranged as a barrel. Likewise, the outer layer consists of seven helices (a1, a3, a5, a7, a9, a11, and a13) with short loops interconnecting the two layers. The extended domain adjacent to the a,a barrel is composed of noncontiguous elements. The first sheet-helix-sheet motif is an extension between helices a7 and a8, and the second helix and sheet are an extension between helices a9 and a10. These extensions form a structure of three twisted, antiparallel b strands flanked by two short a helices (Fig. 2A) and are similar to eukaryotic multiprotein interaction modules such as the Gyf and SH2 domains (fig. S3). However, there is no evidence that this region has functional similarities to either Gyf or SH2 domains (7). Despite the lack of any appreciable sequence similarity, the a-toroidal core structure is topologically similar to bacterial cellulases (13, 14), endoglucanase (15), terpenoid cyclases (16­18), and the b subunit of protein farnesyl transferase (19). Similarly to the structure of farnesyl transferase, a single zinc ion is situated at the top face of the a,a barrel in NisC (Fig. 2A). The topology between the two zinc enzymes is somewhat different, because the NisC toroid is VOL 311 SCIENCE

composed of seven sets of a helices, but the farnesyl transferase b subunit contains six sets of helices. In addition, the helices that constitute the outer layer of the NisC barrel are longer than those seen in farnesyl transferase, resulting in a tighter stacking between the outer and inner cores. The conserved protein residues Cys284, Cys330, and His331 bind the zinc ion, consistent with spectroscopic studies (20), with welldefined electron density assigned to a water molecule completing a tetrahedral coordination geometry (Fig. 3A). This type of coordination is reminiscent of other zinc proteins that catalyze alkylations of thiol substrates such as the Ada protein (21), vitamin B12­dependent Met synthase (22), and B12-independent Met synthase (23, 24). Although the ligand sets, structures, and sequences of these proteins differ, they have in common a net negative charge of the metal site upon coordination of a thiolate substrate (25). This mode of coordination activates the thiolate for nucleophilic attack (26), which, in the case of NisC, is intramolecular. Two other residues that are conserved among the LanC cyclases, His212 and Arg280, are also located in the shallow bowl that is sandwiched between the top of the a-toroid core

Fig. 4. Proposed mechanism for the cyclization reaction catalyzed by NisC illustrated for the formation of the B ring of nisin. Upon binding of the dehydrated peptide, the sulfur of a Cys residue targeted for cyclization displaces the water from the Zn2þ ion and is deprotonated by an active site base or water. Coordination of cysteine to Zn in farnesyl transferase lowers its pKa to 6.4 (25); hence, a protein-derived base is not absolutely required. Attack of the thiolate onto the b carbon of Dhb generates an enolate intermediate that is protonated to provide the D-configuration at the a carbon. Because the stereochemistry of the addition is anti, the active site base that deprotonates Cys must be different from the acid that protonates the enolate. Arg280 might activate a water molecule or could fulfill a different role such as activation of the carbonyl of Dha/Dhb. and the extended domain (Fig. 3, A and B). These residues are likely involved in the acid-base chemistry of the reaction, which entails deprotonation of the Cys residue and protonation of the enolate intermediate generated by conjugate addition to the b carbon of Dha/Dhb (Fig. 4). Arg is not often found as an active site general acid/base because of its high pKa (where Ka is the acid dissociation constant), and its role may be to position and activate a water molecule. The observed stereochemistry resulting from Cys addition to Z-Dhb to produce 2S,3S,6R-3-methyllanthionine requires an anti-addition mechanism, consistent with the location of His212 and Arg280. Modeling of the B ring of nisin, which adopts a well-structured b turn in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of nisin (27), into the active site with the thioether sulfur coordinated to the metal places His212 and Arg280 on opposite faces of the methyllanthionine ring (Fig. 3, B and C). In the cocrystal structures of farnesyltransferase bound to a farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or an FPP analog (28, 29), the isoprenoid is housed within a deep hydrophobic cavity in the center of the b subunit. At the analogous position, NisC has a cavity that is shallower, because the side chains of Leu210 and Trp283 pack to fill the cavity adjacent to the zinc ion. The shallowness of the cavity and its solvent exposure allows NisC to generate thioether rings varying from four to seven amino acids. The regioselectivity of the cyclization is likely governed by processive directionality (30). The structure suggests a possible binding site for the leader sequence of dehydrated prenisin. Residues to one side of the zinc site of NisC define an extensive binding groove lined with hydrophobic (Ile143, Leu262, Phe278, and Tyr285) as well as charged residues (Glu144 and Asp260) and a number of backbone carbonyls. The acidic residues create a negatively charged channel that may interact with the cationic leader peptide containing three Lys and one Arg. One side of this groove is created by the a-toroidal base, whereas the extended region flanks the other side. The structure of NisC provides insights into the LanC-like proteins (LANCL) found in a wide range of organisms that do not produce lantibiotics, such as Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, Arabidopsis thaliana (31), and some mammals. These proteins have 20 to 25% sequence identity with NisC, including the conserved Zn ligands and the putative active site base (fig. S4). They are also predicted to contain the extended domain identified in NisC. LANCL-1 is recruited to the Maurer_s cleft in human erythrocytes during development of Plasmodium falciparum and interacts with the parasite protein PfSBP1 (32), but the physiological function of the LANCL proteins is currently unknown. On the basis of the structural similarity of NisC with farnesyl transferase and the conservation of the metal ligands and peptide binding domain, the LANCL proteins likely carry out the posttranslational modification of a Cys residue of a currently unknown substrate protein.
