Abstract--Starting from (+)-epi- and (¿)-vibo-quercitols readily produced by bioconversion of myo-inositol, some biologically interesting phosphate and polyphosphate analogues, including the Ins(1,4,5)P3 derivatives of 3-deoxy- and 6-deoxy-D -myo-inositol, could be readily prepared in a conventional manner. In addition, chemical modification at C-2 of the 3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3 provided 2-epimer, and 2-deoxy and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro forms. Eight polyphosphate analogues obtained were assayed for biological activity against PDH-Pase and PDH-K, and G6Pase, but none proved positive. ” 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, D -myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate Ins(1,4,5)P3, as well as its bis and tetrakisphosphates, have been demonstrated1 to play important roles as second messengers which control many cellular processes by generating internal calcium signals, which then diffuse through the cytosol and bind to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum causing the release of calcium ions (Ca2+) into the cytosol. Therefore, it is feasible that inhibitors of enzymes of the phosphoinositide cascade, involved in biosynthesis and degradation of Ins(1,4,5)P3, could be of medicinal interest and also invaluable tools to elucidate the individual roles of metabolites in the regulation of cell function. In order to study biochemical and medicinal properties of these polyphosphates, a large number of analogues and derivatives have so far been synthesized2 and their biological activity tested. Recent findings3 of insulin-like and anti-inflammatory properties have also stimulated us to develop means for routine synthesis of these compounds (Fig. 1). Bioconversion4 of myo-inositol readily provides some inaccessible optically active deoxyinositols,5 such as (+)-epi- and (¿)-vibo-quercitols (1 and 2), in quantity, which might allow their application as starting materials

potential candidate new glycosidase inhibitors. In this letter, we describe convenient synthesis of a number of mono-, tris-, and tetrakisphosphate derivatives of 3- and 6-deoxy-D -myo-inositols. In addition, chemical modification at C-2 of the 3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3 was carried out to prepare 2-epimer, and 2-deoxy and 2-deoxy2-fluoro derivatives. Furthermore, in order to provide certain trisphosphate mimics8 designed by analogy with adenophostines,9 the most potent agonists of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor, the 1-phosphate function of the 3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3 was replaced with (phosphinyl)alkyloxyl groups (Schemes 1 and 2). Recently, synthesis of several polyphosphate derivatives of 6-deoxy-D -myo-inositol10 (1) has been elaborated11 from precursors derived from D -galactose, and their biological activity assayed. 6-Deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3 is recognized by the highly selective 3-kinase,12 the kinetics of its metabolism indicate that it is a substrate for this enzyme, with resultant competitive inhibition of phosphorylation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. We here describe a convenient preparative route from (+)-epi-quercitol4 (1). Isopropylidenation6 of 1 with an excess of 2,2-dimethoxypropane and TsOH in DMF was carried out at room temperature to give three readily separable di-O-isopropylidene derivatives

3 (24%), 4 (26%), and 5 (31%). These were treated with dibenzylphosphoryl chloride in pyridine at room temperature to give the respective dibenzylphosphates 6 (77%), 7 (86%), and 8 (87%), hydrogenolysis of which with PtO2 in ethanol produced, after neutralization with cyclohexylamine, the respective phosphates as crystalline amine salts. Treatment of the salts with Dowex 50 W ∑ 2 (H+) resin gave the free phosphates 9 (88%), 10 (70%), and 11 (80%), isolated as bis-sodium salts. Furthermore, compounds 3 and 5 could be partially deO-isopropylidenated with TsOH in EtOH at 0 ∞C to give the triols 12 (70%) and 14 (78%), respectively. Possible contamination of 12 and 14 due to acid-catalyzed migration of the cis-isopropylidene groups was not observed. Compound 14 was similarly phosphorylated to give the protected precursor 15 (60%) of 6-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3.11 The structure of 15 was indirectly confirmed by the fact that 1H NMR spectrum of isomeric trisphosphate 13 obtained for reference from 12 showed coupled signals (d 4.31, ddd, J = 5.6, 8.9, and 13.9 Hz) and (d 4.62, J = 5.1, and 8.9 Hz) due to H-1 and H-2 bonded to carbon atoms of the O-isopropylidene group. Thus, five biologically interesting phosphate analogues could be demonstrated to be readily available from (+)-epi-quercitol (1).

and then with an excess of BnBr to give the benzyl ethers 18 and 19, which were partially de-O-isopropylidenated under the influence of CSA in MeOH to afford, after separation over a silica gel column, the 4- and 6-O-benzyl derivatives 20 (55%) and 21 (42%). Compound 20 was treated with chloromethyl methyl ether and diisopropylethylamine to give the di-O-methoxymethyl derivative 22 (89%), de-O-isopropylidenation of which with 80% aqueous acetic acid gave the diol 23 (88%). Treatment of 23 with dibutyltin oxide and tetrabutyl ammonium bromide at 120 ∞C, and subsequent similar etherification, gave crude methoxymethyl ether 24 (87%). The structure of 24 could be fully characterized with the 1H NMR spectrum of the O-acetyl derivative 25 ($100%) obtained. In addition, 24 was conventionally benzylated to give the 2-O-benzyl derivative 26 (91%). The methoxymethyl groups of 26 were removed by treatment with 4 M hydrochloric acid, and the product was subsequently acetylated to give the tri-O-acetyl derivative 27 (90% over-all yield). Compound 27 was treated ¥ with methanolic sodium methoxide under Zemplen conditions, and the resulting triol was phosphorylated with dibenzyl diisopropylphosphoro-amidite in DMF, and, then the reaction mixture was treated with mCPBA. The product was isolated by chromatography on silica gel to afford the 1,4,5-tris(dibenzylphosphate) 28 (93% over-all yield). Hydrogenolysis of 28 in the presence of 10% Pd/C in aqueous ethanol at room temperature gave the trisphosphate, which was purified by treatment with cyclohexylamine to produce a crystalline salt. This compound was deaminated by passage through a column of Dowex 50 ∑ 2 (H+) resin to afford the free phosphate isolated as a bis-sodium salt 29 (97%). The tetra-O-acetyl derivative 30 (98%), obtained similarly from 20, was deacetylated and a crude alcohol was dibenzylphosphorylated to give tetrakisbenzylphosphate 31 (70% over-all yield). It was deprotected and the product was obtained as a bis-sodium salt15 32 (83%). Oxidation of compound 24 with pyridinium chlorochro∞ mate in the presence of molecular sieves 4 A in CH2Cl2 gave the deoxyinosose derivative 33 (96%), which was reduced with sodium borohydride to give the 2-epimer 34 (56%) as a major product. The structure of 34 was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum of the 2-O-acetyl derivative 35. Compound 34 was converted into the 2-epimer, 3-deoxy-scyllo Ins(1,4,5)P3 39, following the standard sequence of reactions [!36 (95%) !37 (90%) !38 (56%) !39 (97%)]. Treatment of 24 with sulfuryl chloride in pyridine in the presence of DAMP gave the chloride 40 (70%). This compound was treated with tributyltin hydride in the presence of AIBN to provide the 2-deoxy derivative 41 (94%). Starting from 41, 2,3-dideoxy Ins(1,4,5)(P3)14 44 was obtained [!42 (96%) !43 (86%) !44 ($100%)] in a conventional manner. Fluorination of 24 with dimethyl amino sulfur trifluoride (DAST) in CH2Cl2 afforded the 2-deoxy-2-fluoro derivative 45 (70%), which was converted into the tri-O-acetyl derivative 46 (95%). This acetate 46 was deacylated and conventionally phosphorylated to give the trisphosphate 47, which was deprotec-

3-Deoxy-D -myo-inositol-(1,4,5)P3 was first synthesized13,14 from L -quebrachitol through a multi-step sequence and shown to be a good substrate of Ins(1,4,5)P35-phosphatase (Schemes 2 and 3). Isopropylidenation5 of (¿)-vibo-quercitol (2) was carried out by treatment with 2-methoxypropene in the presence of TsOH in DMF at room temperature. A mixture of the 1,2:4,5- 16 and 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene derivatives 17 was, without separation, treated with NaH in DMF

ted to give the deoxyfluoro derivative15 48 (70% over-all yield). Similarly, the alcohol 34 was transformed into the deoxyfluoro derivative15 51 (80% over-all yield) via 49 and 50. Next, adenophosphine9 analogues of 3-deoxy Ins(1,4,5)P3 were prepared. Several permeant analogues of Ins(1,4,5)P3 have been synthesized8 and their ability to cross the membrane tested with vasopressin cells (Scheme 4).

Compound 23 was treated with dibutyltin oxide in toluene, and then after addition of allyl bromide, the mixture was heated at reflux temperature to give the allyl ether 52 (90%), which was characterized as the acetate 53 (96%) as a syrup. Compound 52 was converted into the benzyl ether (!54, 82%), which was subjected to ozonolysis in CH2Cl2/MeOH, followed by reduction with NaBH4 (!55a) and conventional acetylation to give the 2-acetoxyethyl derivative 56a (60% over-all yield). Hydrolysis of 56a with 4 M

Reagents and conditions: (a) Bu2SnO, TBAB, toluene, 120 ∞C; CH2@CHBr; (b) Ac2O, pyridine; (c) NaOMe, MeOH; NaH, BnBr, DMF; (d) (!55a) O3, CH2Cl2/MeOH, ¿78 ∞C; NaBH4, MeOH; (!55b) BH3/ THF, THF; H2O2; (e) Ac2O, pyridine; (f) 4 M HCl, THF; Ac2O, pyridine; (g) NaOMe, MeOH; i-Pr2NP(OBn)2, 1H-Tetrazole, DMF; mCPBA; (h) H2, 10% Pd/C, aqueous 30% EtOH; C6H11NH2, Dowex 50 W ∑ 2 (H+) resin, 1 M NaOMe, MeOH.

hydrochloric acid in THF gave, after conventional acetylation, the acetate 57a (80%). Conventional deO-acetylation of 57a gave the diol, which was treated with 1H-tetrazole in DMF and then with dibenzylisopropylphosphoro-amidite to give the protected trisphosphate 58a (72% over-all yield). Hydrogenolysis of 58a in aqueous ethanol in the presence of 10% Pd/C gave the trisphosphate15 59a ($100%) isolated as a syrupy sodium salt. Hydroboration of 54 was accomplished with boran≠ THF complex in THF, and then the reaction was quenched by addition of water, followed by treatment with 35% aqueous hydroperoxide for 30 min (!55b). The product was isolated as the acetate 56b ($100%) and similarly converted in turn into the trisphosphate15 59b. None of the eight compounds 29, 32, 39, 44, 48, 51, and 59a,b activated pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDH-Pase), or inhibited pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDH-K) significantly. None of the compounds tested inhibited glucose 6-phosphatase (G6Pase) significantly. Compounds 59a and 59b appeared to inhibit lipogenesis (Multi-Well Plate cell based assay). However, the inhibition decreased with increasing concentrations of the test compounds. When tested in vivo in streptozotocin diabetic mice (a model of type I diabetes) at a dose of 1 mg/kg, neither 59a nor 59b had any acute lowering effect on blood glucose. Furthermore, when administered chronically at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 10 days, 59a did not significantly lower blood glucose.
