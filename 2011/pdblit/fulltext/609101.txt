An anti-parallel double-helical structure is proposed for hyaluronic acid in the presence of the cations K + , NH: , Rb + and Cs + In particular the crystalline phase containing potassium ions, and in a defined pH range, has been determined and refined against the X-ray diffraction amplitudes. The reflections in the diffraction pattern index on a tetragonal unit cell (a = b = 1.714 nm, c (fibre axis) = 3.28 nm) with observed systematic absences of the form h + k + 2 - 2n for general hkZ reflections and 1 = 4n (where n is an integer) for 001 reflections. Two double-helical molecules pass through the unit cell at positions (a, a, 0) and (f, 3, 0) as defined by space group 14r22. Each chain forms a contracted (axial advance per disaccharide repeat of 0.82 nm) 44fold left-handed helix which intertwines with a neighbouring chain of opposite polarity about a common axis. Features of the structure are the positioning of the carboxyl group toward the core of the double helix and the presence of hydrophobic and hydrophilic pockets between adjacent double helices. The state of protonation of the hyaluronate molecule is discussed in the light of the infrared evidence. Common physicochemical features of these four cations which promote this particular doublehelical conformation for hyaluronate are considered.

1. Introduction
Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide found throughout connective tissue. It is classified as a glycosaminoglycan and is believed to be a high molecular weight (typically 106) linear molecule with a disaccharide repeating sequence. The two saccharide residues are N-acetyl-B-D-glucosamine and /3-D-glucuronic acid, hereafter referred to as N and G, are considered to be in the low-energy 4CI chair conformation and glycosiditally linked (1 --f 3) di-equatorial and (1 + 4) di-equatorial between G to N and N to G, respectively. Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing of the disaccharide repeat. Monitoring the various semi-crystalline phases by X-ray diffraction has provided a very sensitive technique for studying the secondary structure of hyaluronic acid in

The large N and G represent

the condensed phase. Variation of counter ion species, pH, temperature and relative humidity has enabled a large number of conformations to be observed (Atkins & Sheehan, 1972,1973; Atkins et al., 1972,1973,1973; Dea et al., 1973; Guss et aZ., 1975; Sheehan et al., 1975; Winter et al., 1975). The first conformations observed were 3-fold helical forms (Atkins & Sheehan, 1972) which are now ascribed to the presence of calcium ions. The detailed structure of one of the 3-fold polymorphs has recently been reported by Winter et al. (1975). In this crystalline form the molecule is highly extended with an axial advance per disaccharide of 0.95 nm. The only other hyaluronate structures which have been examined in detail are two sodium salt forms (GUN et al.. 1975) exhibiting 4-fold, or perturbed 4-fold, helical symmetry and with an axial advance per disaccharide of only 035 nm. The X-ray fibre diffraction photograph of this contracted sodium ii-fold hyaluronate, which will be referred to later, is shown in Figure 2. On the basis of this axial advance early model-building calculations suggested a double-helical model (Dea et al., I9i3). Such a model was refuted after more careful consideration based upon detailed X-ray structure-factor calculations and replaced with a contracted single-helix model (Guss et al., 1975). Thus to date all the refined conformations of hyaluronate are based on single-strand helical models. In this paper we wish to report on new X-ray diffraction patterns obtained from hyaluronic acid crystallized in the presence of the four univalent counter ions K + , Rb+, Cs+ and NH:. A fibre-type X-ray diffraction photograph of hyaluronic acid crystallized in the presence of potassium at low pH is representative of the whole group and is shown in Figure 3. The pattern exhibits 4-fold helical symmetry with a measured axial advance of 0.82 nm. Although this new contracted version has similar helical parameters to the contracted version previously mentioned (Fig. 2) the distribut.ion of intensities is different as can be seen by comparing Figure 3 with Figure 2.

the basis of a structure determination of the low pH form of the hyaluronic acid in structure to explain these new the presence of potassium we propose a double-helical diffraction patterns. We wish to stress that this double-helical model should not be confused with a previous and erroneous report (Des, et al., 1973) of double helices in hyaluronate.

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Materials

Materials for experiments involving large quantities of hyaluronate were purchased from Miles Seravac (Miles Laboratories, Stoke Court, Stoke Poges, Slough, England) in 2 grades. Grade II material was sold as the potassium salt and was extracted from human umbilical cord. It contained impurities of chondroitin sulphate -100/o and some protein -5%. Grade I was a purified form of t,ht shove lnaterial containing less t,han 3% of chondroitin sulphate and -1 o/0 protein. arid rooster comb, wore Other sources of material, typically bovine vitreous llumour used for particular experiments. The rooster comb material was obtained as a present from Dr C. F. Phelps (then Biochemistry Department, University of Bristol). The hyaluronate from vitreous humour was prepared by breaking down the vitreous gel using a large-bore syringe and then subjecting t,hc resulting solution t,o extensive dialysis against distilled water. With this treatment most of the collagen precipitated from solution and was removed by centrifugation. The hyaluronate was subsequently obtained by freeze-drying or precipitation with acetone. It was found that similar results were obtained from all materials after the same preparative sequence (see hrlow).

(i) Potassium

salt

To ensure the correct stoichiometry of the hyaluroltate, the material was first converted to the acid form by passing solutions of hyaluronate through an MB2 mixed bed ion exchange resin (BDH, Poole, Dorset). The solution of hyaluronate obtained in this manner was titrated using potassium hydroxide. Samples of solution were removed every 0.2 pH unit between pH 3.0 and pH 4.0, and every 0.5 pH unit between pH 4.0 and pH 10.0, and films were cast (see below). At, pH 10 the process was reversed using hydrochloric acid to bring the solution back to pH 3.0, again taking samples of solution in the manner described above. In this paper we wish only to discuss the X-ray diffraction patt,erns obtained from film cast, from solutions in thr pH range 3.0 to 4.0. (ii) Ammonium, rubidium an,d caesium salts

In the preparation of these salt forms we used a slightly different procedure. Hyaluronic acid solution (prepared as described in section (i) above) was extensively dialysed against 1,O M solutions of rubidium chloride, caesium chloride and ammonium chloride. These solut~ions were subsequently dialyst=d against distilled water and films cast in the usual way. It was not always necessary to take the hyahu-onate into the acid form to induce the hyaluronate to adopt this particular conformation. Alternatively, solutions of sodium hyaluronate (-2 mg ml) were dialysed against 1-O M-ammonium chloride solutions. The ammonium chloride was dialysed out and films prepared. The X-ray diffraction photographs obtained from such specimens exhibited this new contracted conformation although in some cases the patterns of other crystalline phases were superimposed. A similar procedure giving comparable results was performed for rubidium chloride. (iii) Film
preparation

Films were cast on glass slides treated with "Rcpelcote" (BDH, Poole, Dorset) or on polythene or nylon substrates. (These materials were produced by synthetic polymer group at Bristol.) The films were cut into strips and stretched under constant load at 90 to 98%

relative humidity for up to a week or more (Atkins et al., 1972). For films cast from A solution with an excess of salt present it was found that only strips from the edge of thrt dried-down film could be used. (c) X-ray diffraction

X-ray diffraction photographs were recorded on flat film using a camera with pinhole collimation (250 pm diam.) and Ni-filtered CuKa radiation. Calcite (characteristic spacing, O-3035 nm) was used as an internal diffraction calibrat)ion. The atmosphere in the camera was maintained at the desired relativo humidity by flushing the camera with hydrogen equilibrated to the required relative humidity with the appropriate saturated salt solution. Using interplanar spacings measured on the original diagrams the unit cell dimensions were refined by a least-squares procedure. Relative intensities were measured by taking radial microdensitometer traces across each reflection. Corrections for Lorentz polarization, multiplicity and for oblique incidence on the film were applied. Reflections which could be observed on the X-ray photograph, but were unsuitable for densitometering, were visually estimated. Unobserved reflections which could not be accounted for by systematic absences were assigned a value of two-thirds of the intensity of the weakest (visually estimated) reflection and the appropriate correction fact,ors applied. (d) Model building

: Molecular models were generated using a linked-atom description similar to that reported by Arnott & Wonacott (1966). The positions of the atoms were defined in terms of the internal bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles of the molecule. Stereochemical parameters for the pyranose rings were taken from the average set given by Arnott & Scott (1972) for the 4C, chair pyranose residue. Bond lengths and bond angles were held constant including the glycosidic bond angles which were held at, the value of 116.5". This defines the pyranose rings and side groups as rigid bodies and leaves the glycosidic torsion angles and the torsion angles that, define the orientation of hydroxymethyl, carboxyl, and planar amide groups as explicit variables. These parameters were varied so as to produce a model with the appropriate helical symmetry and pitch, and with the minimum amount of non-bonded steric interactions. This was accomplished by using the technique reported by Guss et al. (1975), and minimizing the function @ containing the non-bonded steric parameters and the appropriate constraints. where 0 = xc, E, = k,(,dj -+ C&G,, d,)2, dj < ,dj

The second summation a series of Lagrangian multipliers, h,, and constraint expressions, G,, that we contains wish to become zero. Through their use helical continuity, pitch and symmetry were imposed on the model. Between certain atoms there is the possibility of an attractive interaction such as a hydrogen bond. In these cases, if the distance, d,, falls between specified limits *d, and Bdj (*dj < d, < Bdj) then an addit,ional term is considered eJ = &,(rd, -- dJ2, ,d, i d, 2: ,A

Values for the weighting constants and the distances that define the interactions were taken from Guss et al. (1975). The minimum value of 9 is a measure of the steric acceptability of a molecular model.
(CT) X-ray refinement

Applying a procedure similar to that used in the model building, structural models refined against the observed X-ray data. Subject to the same Lagrangian constraints, refinable molecular parameters and the appropriate chain-packing parameters

3. Infrared Spectra
Infrared spectra were recorded from the films used in the X-ray diffraction experiments using a Perkin Elmer 257 infrared grating spectrophotometer. The principal region of interest is the 1800 to 1400 cm-' spectral range for films cast from solutions between pH 2.0 and pH 8.0 for a potassium titration experiment. Spectrum (a) shown in Figure 4 was obtained from a film cast at pH 2.2 and is thought to represent the spectrum of the free acid. We attribute the band at 1730 cm-l to the carboxyl stretching vibration. At the other extreme, spectrum (d) in Figure 4 was obtained from a film cast at pH 7.0 and is thought to represent t'he spectrum of the carboxylic acid salt. In this spectrum the band at 1730 cm-' has been completely replaced by a band in the region of 1600 to 1620 cm- l which has been assigned to the antisymmetric stretching in the resonance-stabilized carboxylate anion group (Gael et al., 1976; Parker, 1971). During the titration experiments all films that were cast below pH 4.0 had the carboxyl stretching band at 1730 cm-l and, on orientation, gave the X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 3) discussed in this paper. In addition there is an observed band in the carboxylate stretching region. While it is not possible to yuantitate the of each species, the effect, of pH on the position of the band is clearly proportion illustrated.

The reflections were indexed on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell with dimensions a = 6 = 1.714 nm and c (fibre axis) = 3.28 nm. Meridional reflections exist very weakly on the fourth and stronger on the eighth layer lines. All reflections in the diffraction pattern can be indexed with hkl Miller indices of the form h + k + 1 = 2n, where 12 is an integer.

isomorphous. In the X-ray pattern obtained from the Cs+ hyaluronate the isomorphous crystal phase is also observed but it is partially obscured by the presence of additional crystalline phases. In all salt forms a rapid deterioration in the diffraction pattern is observed on reducing the relative humidity. (b) Contents of the unit cell The presence of meridional reflections only on layer lines where 1 = 4n is most simply explained by a 4-fold helical conformation for the hyaluronate molecule. Based on volume considerations (Atkins et al., 1974) the maximum number of chains in the unit cell is six. However, this would require an anhydrous structure which is extremely unlikely given the experimental conditions required to maintain this form. Therefore the most reasonable number of chains, considering the tetragonal symmetry of the crystal lattice, is four. With four chains there is room for seven to eight water molecules per disaccharide unit which is consistent with the high level of hydration needed to maintain the structure. Because the hyaluronate was crystallized in the presence of potassium it is likely that some of these ions are also contained presented here are based upon the within the unit cell. But since the calculations hyaluronate molecule using water-corrected structure factors with no attempt to find the cation sites, the actual number and position of the potassium will not affect the conclusions drawn. (c) Consideration of possible space groups

To summarize the information presented in the preceding sections, the correct space group for the unit cell must be consistent with the four following observations : (1) the cell is tetragonal (2) all observed ; are of the class h f k + 1 = 2n; reflections

(3) observed meridional

(0 0 1) reflections

are of the class I = 4n; of four disaccharide

(4) there are four chain segments in the unit cell, each consisting units,

Consideration of possible space groups shows that there are only two which meet these requirements, namely, the tetragonal space groups I4,22 and 14,. Both space groups have sites which could accommodate chains of either chirality. The higher symmetry group 14,22 demands a structure with anti-parallel double helices at (t, 4, 0) l 3 helices). Our and (2, 2, 0) (left-handed helices) or at (Z, a, 0) and (2, 4, 0) (right-handed model building has shown that while left-handed models can be constructed, it is not possible to construct an acceptable right-handed helical model. This finding is consistent with that of workers investigating other hyaluronate structures (Guss et al., 1975; Winter et al., 1975) and led us to reject right-handed helical structures. A schematic drawing of the placement of left-handed double helices in the unit cell is shown in Figure 8. Within the double helix the rotations of the two chains are symmetry-related as are the translations of the chains along the common helix axis. The two double helices in the unit cell are related by a dyad axis that passes through the centre of the unit cell and lies parallel to the helix axes. The only packing parameters needed to define the structure are the translation of the chain along the helix axis (w) and the rotation (pl) of the chain about the helix axis. The second space group which is in agreement with our experimental observations

The chain rotations are represented by p1 and ~2. Ifp i = p2 then the space group is I4,22. However if pl -+ Pz, the space group is 141. (The radii of the chains are shown differently for illustration only.) is 14,. With

the elimination of right-handed structures, the only possible arrangement of hyaluronate molecules consistent with our knowledge of the unit cell contents is as left-handed double helices at the sites (a, $, 0) and ( 2, 2, 0). The simplest explanation of a structure in this space group is that the double helices contain antiparallel chains, In such a case the chains would have independent rotations (pl and p2; see Fig. 8) and the structure could be thought of as a perturbed form of the I4,22 structure. On the other hand, since there is no crystallographic symmetry operation relating the two chains in the double helices, it is theoretically possible that the chains are parallel. However, all left-handed double helical models containing parallel chains have severe non-bonded contacts and can be rejected?. With this overwhelming evidence for the presence of a double-helical structure it is interesting to speculate on how our observations would have to be compromised to of single-helical models. If we invoke the unlikely hypothesis allow the consideration that the molecule is a S-fold rather than a 4-fold helix and that the 002 and 006 reflections are "accidentally" absent from the X-ray diffraction patterns of the four univalent salt forms we are considering it is possible to consider the tetragonal space group I4. This space group allows for a structure with single helices and the symmetry requires that the molecules be parallel and related by a 4-fold rotation axis. In order to consider a structure with antiparallel single helices it is necessary to invoke not only the presence of 2-fold helices, but also the presence of orthorhombic symmetry and the coincidental equivalence of the a and b dimensions of the unit cells. This would allow the consideration of orthorhombic space group 1222. It is interesting to note that the relaxations of the strict interpretation of the X-ray patterns which
7 Parallel double helices can be thought of as falling into 2 families. If the chains are related by a rotation of exactly 180" then odd-order layer lines would be systematically absent and the structure would in fact be an g-fold helix repeating 6.66 nm. 8, and 8, helices can be rejected based on considerations of an isolated chain (Rees, 1969a), while 8s and 8s models will not pack as a double helix. On the other hand if the chains 8re related by a rotation #180" then all layer lines will be present and the double helix would consist of parallel 4-fold helical chains repeating in the observed fibre repeat (3.28 nm). All such models can be rejected on packing considerations.

would allow the consideration of the I222 space group would also allow the consideration of space group 12,2,2, which is a double-helical model which represents a perturbation of the 14,22 symmetry. Although these space groups are unlikely they were considered for the sake of completeness and will be referred to again later.

5. Model Building
While inspection of the diffraction pattern provides evidence that the structure is double-h:lical, it does not per se provide a,ny means of distinguishing between the two possible crystal models, i.e. I4,22 or 14,. Instead it was necessary to produce various conformational models for the hyaluronate chain and then vary the packing parameters in a systematic fashion, and at each packing position the stereochemical acceptability and agreement between observed and calculated structure amplitudes were assessed. Minimization of @ (eqn(l)) permits the generation of isolated single helices of appropriate symmetry and minimal non-bonded interactions within the single chain. We found two families of left-handed backbone conformations which give very similar low values for @. Chains in the first group (type I) are characterized by the possibility of an O,,,, . . . O(,,, hydrogen bond across the (1 --f 4) glycosidic linkage. This intramolecular hydrogen bond has been proposed in the contracted 4-fold sodium hyaluronate (Guss et al., 1975) and the extended S-fold form (Winter et aZ., 1975). In chains of the second conformational grouping (type II), the glycosidic torsion angles are such that no intramolecular hydrogen bond of this kind can be proposed. Following the scan procedure described above, structures based on the different chain conformations, i.e. types I and II, were investigated. This task was simplified by the severe stereochemical restrictions imposed on any double-helical model.

6. Structure Refinement
Least-squares refinements were performed on models with type I and type II conformations. Initially the models were refined in space group I4,22 by allowing the molecular parameters and the packing parameters t~i and w to vary. Only in the final stages of the refinement was the space group I4, investigated by allowing the additional packing parameter p&i) to be varied. Models were refined against the X-ray data only. The presence or absence of over-short contacts in the refined structures was used as a criterion for assessing the acceptability of the models. (a) Rejinement of models containin,g type I chain conformations

Packing and structure-factor scans of the rigid hyaluronate molecule in the type I conformation showed that the sterically allowed packing region for the model did not give good agreement between the observed and calculated structure factors as indicated by the X-ray residuals R' and R". The structure was refined from several

125

different initial packing positions but in all cases t.he resulting structure had severe non-bonded contacts. One refined model gave X-ray residuals with values R' = 0.29 and R" = 0.31. However, there were several unacceptable short intramolecular contacts between chains in the double helix. Attempts were made to remove these contacts. but in doing so the agreement between the observed and calculated structure factors was compromised to an unacceptable extent (R' = 0.42. R" = 0.45). Thus models with type T conformations were rejected in favour of type 11 models.
(h) Rejinement of modeb containing type II chain conformations

For the type 11 chain models the sterically allowed region of the packing scans corresponds with the region of best agreement with the X-ray observations. Refinement of the structure using the space group 14,22 produced a model with residuals R' = 0.25 and R" = 0.27. This refined model met our packing criteria except for one short contact (O(,,,O,,,,) between chains in adjacent double helices. In this structure the parameter which defines the orientation of the hpdroxymethyl group (B[C(,,,, c (5)Nl %,N. O(,,,]) is 28.6". By rotating this group to 70.0" we obtained a sterically acceptable model with residuals of R' = 0.27 and R" = 0.29. The parameters of this final structure are given in Table 1. Observed and calculated structure amplitudes for the relevant Bragg reflections are tabulated in Table 2. The labelling and coordinates of atoms are illustrated in Figure 1 and listed in Table 3, respectively. The structure was examined a stage further by refining the overall temperature factor and allowing the model to refine in space group 14, (which has the extra allowable rotational packing parameter pz). In both cases the additional degree of freedom produced negligible change in the model and no significant improvement in structure factor amplitudes. the agreement between the observed and calculated Consequently the structure derived from the conformation without intramolecular hydrogen bonds (type IT) in space group 14,22 was taken as our final structure.

7. Consideration of Single-helix Model
From the basic consideration of the X-ray diffraction pattern it is extremely unlikely that we are dealing with a structure containing single helices (see Diffraction Patterns and Unit Cell Properties, section (c)). However, for the sake of completeness we did construct single-helical structures as dictated by the symmetry of the tetragonal space group I4 and the orthorhombic space group 1222. For both space groups it is necessary to describe the hyaluronate molecule as a 2-fold helix with two disaccharides in the asymmetric unit rather than as a 4-fold helix where the asymmetric unit is a disaccharide. This redefinition of chain symmetry does in theory allow us to consider models that represent gross distortions of 4-fold models. However, in practice we are limited to considering only models very close to unperturbed 4-fold helices by the experimental observation of the unobserved (below threshold) 002 and 006 reflections. The extreme sensitivity of these meridional reflections to small perturbations of the hyaluronate chain symmetry is amply illustrated by the contracted sodium salt form. When the material is dry the X-ray diffraction pattern shows only meridional reflections with indices 1 = 471. However, on hydration the molecule becomes a 2-fold helix with prominent 002 and 006 reflections. Detailed structure factor calculations have shown that the conformations in the two forms are very similar (Guss et al., 1975). In the I4 space group the chains are related by a 4-fold rotation axis. As a consequence of this symmetry operation the chains must be parallel and at equal height in the cell. This disposition of chains produces steric clashes between equivalent groups on neighbouring chains which could not be removed. Attempts to remove the contacts

by perturbing the backbone conformation produce unacceptable intensity for the 002 and 006 reflections. Use of the orthorhombic space group I222 allows the considerations of antiparallel chains. There is scope for relative translations of neighbouring chains so that it is possible to produce a stereochemically acceptable model incorporating a 4-fold helical model. However, this molecular symmetry, when combined with the space group symmetry for this unit cell, produces the systematic cancelling of the 110 reflection, a reflection which is observed to be of medium strength in our diffraction patterns. The calculated value for this reflection could be increased by emphasising the 2-fold nature of the model, but this also produced intensities for the 002 and 006 reflections that are totally inconsistent with our observations.

The proposed model is a left-handed antiparallel double helix. Figure 9(a) illustrates the conformation of an isolated hyaluronate chain. The glycosidic torsion angles. given in Table 1, are such that there are no intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the non-bonded contacts. This chain. together with its backbone and no over-short antiparallel partner, is shown in Figure 9(b). The two chains are intertwined so that no over-short contacts between chains are present. A consequence of the chirality of the molecule is that the carboxyl groups are placed towards the centre of the double helix (see Fig. 9(c)). The packing mode for the double helices is illustrated in Figure 10. Figure 10(a) shows a view down the fibre axis of the double helix surrounded by the four nearest neighbours. The chains are closely packed along the diagonals of the unit cell. Figure IO(b) illustrates a projection of the double helix and its neighbours in the (110) plane. The chains form a "wire mesh" effect exhibiting a honeycomb of pockets between neighbouring chains. These pockets are of two distinct types. One type has hydroxyl groups emanating from four different chains giving rise to a hydrophilic pocket, whilst the other type has the faces of four glucuronic acid residues forming a hydrophobic pocket. If the carboxyl groups were charged it is difficult to see how such a structure could be stabilized. Therefore it is likely that the structure is either hemiprotonated or fully protonated, so lowering or completely cancelling the electrostatic interaction along the core of the double helix. Such a situation would also allow the carboxyl groups to There is evidence for the protonated hydrogen bond and stabilize the structure. carboxyl group in the infrared spectra (see Infrared Spectra). The proposed model is based on a least-squares refinement against an X-ray data set consisting of 38 observed reflections and 15 below-threshold reflections with dspacing to the value of 0.3 nm. The model accounts for the unobserved reflections?, the relative intensities of the meridional reflections and gives an agreement with the observed X-ray data that is comparable with other published hyaluronate structure refinements (Guss et al., 1975; Winter et al., 1975); however it has certain deficiencies. First, the model does not show any obvious interactions between chains in the double

Second, there is uncertainty in the position and number of water molecules and counter ions in the unit cell, although this has been partially compensated for by using water-corrected structure factors. The introduction of water molecules and counter ions into the structure would introduce too many degrees of freedom to be meaningfully determined by the present data set. (b) Comparison of double helix with contracted sodium salt form

A model for a left-handed 4-fold helix of hyaluronate with a similar axial advance per residue has been discussed before (Guss et al., 1975). They showed that a double helix was inconsistent with the diffraction evidence for sodium hyaluronate (e.g. Fig. 2). We are left with the questions : (a) how closely are the two contracted forms related and (b) why does the molecule adopt two such different interactions for similar axial advances (0.82 nm and O&5 nm) and identical 4-fold helical symmetry? To test question (a) a model was constructed based on the structure of Guss et al. (1975). This was our type I conformation. An X-ray refinement starting at a packing position for the double helix yielded a similar fit with the observed data but had several severe

bad contacts, both in the backbone of the chain and between chains in the double helix. Attempts to remove these steric clashes resulted in unacceptable values of the high X-ray residuals. The starting point for the model we present here is one unbiased by any particular choice of intrachain hydrogen bonds. The X-ray refinement, from an allowable packing position gives no significant change in the backbone of the molecule or the packing parameters, which would suggest a particular set of positive interactions. At the same time the R value attained was better than that reached for any model tried involving specific interactions. For these reasons we offer this model as a useful starting point for further refinement when a superior data set is available between particular interactions at in the belief that it is not realistic to distinguish this time. The question (b) of why the molecule adopts such apparently similar conformation in two such different structures will not be answered until there is a better understanding of the various energy terms involved in the conformation adopted by a polyelectrolyte. Three important terms in a full analysis come to mind immediately. (i) The long range electrostatic COO- side group). force between the "fixed" charged groups (i.e. the between

The diffraction pattern we attribute to the double helix was obtained in the presence of potassium only, below pH 4.0. Care was taken to ensure that the starting material was in the acid form and free from any excess salt. However, the presence of this particular crystalline phase was found to be independent of salt concentration in solution to at least as high as O-2 M-potassium chloride. Similar experiments on the same material using sodium hydroxide as titrant did not yield this phase. In the presence of sodium, films crystallized below pH 4.0 exhibited the very extended 2-fold conformation first reported by Atkins et al. (1972). Above pH 4.0 the contracted form of sodium hyaluronate was obtained. We thus conclude that: (a) the presence of potassium as opposed to sodium is important,: ion with potassium is important. (b) the presence of the hydrogen

Based on these observations it is likely that this crystalline phase is a protonated or at least a hemiprotonated form. This is consistent with the placing of the carboxyl groups in the centre of the helix as outlined above. That charged and uncharged species of the carboxyl group exist in the films shows that this crystalline phase is supported by the infrared spectra of the films. There is a clear change in the position of the antisymmetric stretch band of the carboxyl group from 1730 cm-l to 1610 cm -I for the carboxylate form as the pH is increased (Fig. 4).

(ii) NH,f , Rb+, Cs+ cations Dialysis of the acid salt of hyaluronic acid against solutions of 1.0 M-NH&I, RbCl, and CaCl yields isomorphous diffraction patterns (see Diffraction Patterns and Unit Cell Properties). A more important observation is that this phase is produced in the presence of the ammonium and rubidium ion without going through the acid form. Thus by introducing ammonium chloride or rubidium chloride into a solution of sodium hyaluronate and then making specimens in the usual way the crystalline phase in question is produced. Figure 5 shows the infrared spectra taken from these films and again there is clear evidence for the presence of bonds at 1610 cm-l and 1730 cm-`. Table 4 shows that these ions (i.e. K+, Rb + , Cs + , NH:) form a group both with regard to physical size, as defined by the Pauling crystal radius, and their effect on bulk water as evidenced by thermodynamic and viscosity data. On the basis of such evidence these ions have been called "water structure" breakers (Frank & Robinson, TABLE 4 Physical and thermodynamic

1940; Frank & Evans, 1945). The model used to describe water structure is that of co-operative association and disassociation of water molecules forming flickering clusters of ice-like structure (Frank & Wen-Yang Wen, 1957). It was postulated that the presence of these ions interferes with the formation and/or lifetime of these clusters thus acting as a structure breaker and bringing about the observed physical changes in aqueous solution. Thus an interesting speculation is that the formation of the double helix is a response to the change of structure of the bulk medium as well as possible specific binding interactions between these ions and this conformation of hyaluronic acid. Calculations concerning the hydration energy of this group of ions show that they are weakly hydrated (Samoilov, 1957 ; Halliwell & Nyburg, 1963). and experiments

on the strength of the binding of the alkali metal ions to ion exchange resins typically show an order Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Li +. This has been explained by the argument that the weaker the energy of hydration the closer the ion can approach the electronegative site and thus the stronger the binding. By this argument we might expect the ions in question to bind more strongly to hyaluronate than say Na+ or Li + . Unfortunately the possible presence of ions and their positions in the unit cell remain undecided for reasons given above. (d) Biological implications

It is the response of the hyaluronate molecule to this group of ions as a whole which is so interesting. Perhaps such a response could be of a fairly general type and might be provoked by the presence of other positively charged organic molecules. The transformation of single helix to double helix in a biological context is always interesting and especially so in hyaluronate for a number of reasons. The double helix formed is likely to be metastable and therefore have a dynamic nature in which it is being formed or broken in response to some stimulus. Upon formation and because of the intrinsic nature of the double helix it is likely to modify the mechanical, electromechanical and electro-chemical properties of the hyaluronic acid network and therefore change the activity of the water, ions and macromolecules permeating the network. Purthermore its presence might facilitate some mode of binding between itself and other macromolecules. In the original model proposed as the double helix (Dea et al., 1973) its existence was linked to the presence of a viscoelastic transition found in hyaluronic acid at around pH 2.5 (Gibbs et al., 1968; Chakrabarti & Balazs, 1973). It was proposed that a double helix might become the site for cross-linking in the gel in a similar way t'o that proposed for carrageenan gels (Rees, 19693). Although we have not undertaken a detailed study of the properties of solutions from which this crystalline phase was isolated it does not appear likely that this double helix is implicated in the formation of the viscoelastic paste. We say this because no dramatic viscoelastic transition of the type described by Gibbs et al. (1968) was observed in the routine experiments described in Materials and Methods.
