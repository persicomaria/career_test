Retinoids are quite insoluble and chemically unstable compounds in thc aqucous mcdium, such that natural retinoids nccd to be bound to specific retinoid-binding protcins to be protected, solubilized and transported in body fluids. All-tmns retilioic acid exhibits a relatively high affinity for thyroxine-binding transthyretin irz vitm and this protein is a good candidate for the transport of retinoic acid adn~iniskred us pharmacological or antitumor agent. To dcfitic structural features esseniial for the recognition by transthyrctin of a ligand which is structurally unrclatcd to thyroxine, we have cocrysiallized humun transthyrctin with retinoic acid and deleiinincd its structure at 0.18-nrri tesulution. The retinoid fits into thc two chemically identical thyroxine-binding sites, which are located in the ccntral channcl that rutis through the tetranieric transthyretin. The cyclohexene ring of the hound retinoid is innermost, occupying the sarrie position of the phenolic ring of the bound 3,3'-diiorlo-L-tliyrotiitie, whereas the carboxylate group, like the same group of the thyroid hormone, participatcs in an ionic interaction with the LyslS sidc chain at the entrancc of the channel. Despitc the fact that transthyretin was cocrystallized with all-/rrrn,r-retinoic acid, the isoprene chain of the bound retinoid hus bccn found i n a non-exlendcd conforniation. This feature, that allows thc carboxylate to oricnt in a manner suitable for ion-pair association with the LyslS side chain, is attributable to the conversion of all-trans-retinoic acid into cis-isomers or folded cotifortiiers. 0 It is concluded that the prcsence, i n an essentially hydrophobic rnolecular corc of the appropriate s i 7 ~ 1 a negatively charged group at the correct position is a crucial requirement for Iigand-tratisthyretirl recognition. Whereas the binding of the ligand has no remarkable conscqucnces for the prolein structure, alltmns-retinoic acid undergoes structural changes such as to interact favorably with residues preseni in the thyroxine-binding sites, rcsetiibling roughly the natural ligantl.

The increasing intercst in synthetic retinoids exhibiting pharmacological and antitumor activities ruiscs some relevant qucstions as lo their mode of bindiiig to potential carrier proteins. Retinoids are highly unstablc nnd poorly soluble compounds in the aqucous rriedium and their interactions with binding protcins inay be required to soluhilize and protect them to a large extent. Previous studies have shown that cicspite its affinity for alltrurwretinc7ic acid, retinol-binding protein (REP) is an unlikely candidate for the plasma transport of this compound administered ai high doses as a thcrapeutic agent. RBP is present in the plasmii esscntially as a complex with retinol, and all-tmns-retinoic acid has proved to be a weak coinpetitor with the natural ligand for the RBP rctinol-binding site (Berni et al., 1993). A different situation can be envisioned for other plasma proteins, like serum alburnin and transthyretin, as potential carrier of retinoic acid. Transthyretin i s onc of three proteins that transport in thyroxine (3,5,3',S`-tetraiodo-t~-thyroniii~) plasma. However, only a small portion of the circulating transthyretin is involved i n the transport of thyroxine. Most of the thyroxine circulating in human plasma is transported by thyroxine-binding globulin

and only 10-20%1 is carried by trunsthyrctin (Rohhins and Bartalena, `I986; Rartalenii, 1990). Since the plasma conccntratinn o f transthyrctin (approximately 4.5 pM) largely exceeds that of thyroxine (approximately 0.1 1 pM), il can be ustimated that the amount of transthyretin associutcd with thyroxine in the circulation is less than 0.5%I of the circulating mi-ricr protein (Robbins and Rartalena, 1986). Thus, neat-ly all of the horrl-iune-binditi~ sites on circulating transthyrctin are presurriahly available fbr the binding of pharmacologically active compuuiids, like retinoic ircid which is known to bind with relaiively high affinity 10 transthyretin in ijitw (Smith el al., 1994). The suhstanti;rl lack of thyroxinc bound to its sitcs on trmsthyreliii uiidcr norrtial conditions i s also deduced from thc crystal structure of native trnnsthyretin (Blukc and Oatley, 1977; Blake el a ] . , 1978; Zanotti, G., unpublished results). ?`ratisthyretin is an oligomeric protein of SS kDa. composed of four chemically identical subunits, of' known crystal struciurc (Blake er al., ,1978; Hamilton ct al., 1993). X-ray crystallrtgraphic studies have also provided ~iiolecular detiiils of the ititerac t i o ti of this tran sport protein with i ts small lignrid thy t-oxi lie (Blake and Oatley, 1977; Blariey el al., 1982) and with RRP (Monaco et al., 1995). The four subunits, which consis( of two four-stranded /&sheets, arc oriented i n tr;insthyretin to fot-m ii central channel that runs through thc whole tetramer and cotitains two nearly idenlical thyroxiiie-bintling sites.

affinity for thyroxine (Ferguson et al., 1975). The molecular basis underlying the apparent negative cooperativity in ligand binding has yet to be elucidated. The assembly of the four subunits is such that the tetramer possesses a 222 symmetry. In the crystal, a dimcr is present in the asymmetric unit. Consequently, two dimers in the tetramer are identical, related to each other by a crystallographic two-fold axis. In contrast, the two monomers in the dimer are quite similar, but not identical in the crystal structure. Each thyroxine-binding site is in a pocket in between two monomers related by the two-fold crystallographic axis. The thyroxinc molecule is oriented along the central channel with the phenolic hydroxyl group buried deep whithin each binding site and thc carboxyl and amino groups ion-paired with the LyslS and Glu54 side chains at the entrance of the channel (Blake and Oatley, 1977; Blaney et al., 1982). In addition to thyroxine and retinoic acid, transthyretin is known to bind a variety of other molecules: products of thyroxine deiodination (Andrea et al., 1980; Somack et al., 1982), pharmacological agents such as pcnicillin, salicylates, steroids, flavonoids and the cardiotonic drug milrinone (Cavalieri and Pitt-Rivers, 1981; Ciszak et al., 1992; Wojtczak et al., 1993), and environmental contaminants, such as hydroxylated polychlorinated biphenyls, dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans (Lans et al., 1994). Recently, i t has been found that human plasma transthyretin is associated with a yellow compound attributable to a pterin derivativc (Ernstriim ct al., lY95). The cocrystallization of transthyretin with some of the above ligands has yielded crystals isomorphous to those of native transthyretin. The crystal structure determination of transthyretin complexed with lhe thyroid hormone metabolite 3,~'-diiodo-r.-thyronine (Wojtczak et al., 1992), the flavone derivative bromoauronc (Ciszak et id., 1992) and milrinone (Wojtczak ct al., 1993) has provided additional information on the structural aspects of ligand-transthyretin recognition. The latter ligands are accommodated in the central channel of the transthyretin tetramer, occupying the two thyroxine-binding sites. Their binding inodes are similar, to a certain degree, to that found for the natural ligand, although significant diffcrences exist. This similarity may be attributed to the structural similarity of 3,3'-diiodo-~-thyronincand milrinone with thyroxine (Wojtczak et al., 1992, 1993) and to the ability of the aurones to mimic thyroid-hormone conforrnational features (Ciszak et al., 1992). T has been suggested previously that the elucidation of the t structural features of the retinoic acid-protein interactions is particularly relevant sincc such interactions might mimic those between the retinoid and nuclear receptors, for which molecular details have yet to be defined (Newcomer, 1993). To the best of

our knowledge, the high-resolution crystal structures of three complexes of rctinoic acid with binding proteins have been determined previously, namely with epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein (E-RABP; Newcorner, 1993), retinol-binding protein (Zanotti et al., 1994) and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (Kleywegt et al., 1994). In view of the quite low degree of ligand-binding specificity exhibited by transthyretin, it appeared to be of intcrest to gain insight into the molecular basis underlying this ligation property of transthyretin. The present investigation was undertaken to identify the structural features essential for the recognition by transthyretin of retinoic acid, a ligand which is structurally unrelated to thyroxine. We have cocrystallized human transthyretin with retinoic acid and dcscribe here the structural features of the rctinoic acid-transthyretin interaction.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization of the transthyretin-retinoic-acid complex. Human transthyretin was purified from fresh plasma essentially as described (Peterson, 1971). As the last step of purification, transthyretin was also subjected to chromatography on a Waters DEAE 5-PW column, developed with a linear NaCl gradient ( h m 0 to 0.15 M), i n 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.3, transthyretin was quantified by its absorbance at 780 nm, using an absorof 14.3. To preparc the transthyretinbance coefficient A , relinoic acid complex, a sniall aliquot of an ethanolic solution of all-lmns-retinoic acid (Fluka) was arkled to transthyretin (0.15 mM) i n 20 mM Tris/HCI, 30 mM NaCI, pH 7.3, at 20°C for 1 h. The retinoid/protein molar ratio was about 2 : l . Single crystals of the complex grew in sitting-drop vapor-diffusion experimcnts from solutions of 2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M sodium citratc, pH 7.0, at room temperature. These crystals are isomorphous to those of human apotransthyretin (space group P2,2,2) and the cell parameters correspond to those reported by Hamilton et al. (1993): a = 4.380 nm, b = 8.622 nm, c = 6.578 nm. The absorption spectrum of the transthyretin-bound retinoic acid in the crystal was obtained by means of single crystal microspectrophotometric analysis, using a Zeiss MPM 800 microspectrophotorneter. Extraction and HPLC analysis of transthyretin-bound retinoids. Crystals of retinoic-acid-transthyretin that had been in the sitting-drop experiments at room temperature for over 5 months, as in the case of the crystals used for X-ray diffraction studies, were extensively washed with 70 % saturated ammo' nium sulfate, pH 7.0, and dissolved in water.

The step of extraction with hcxanc was repeated twice. The two hexane phases were then combined, taken to dryness and resuspended in thc HPLC mobile phase, which consisted of waterhethanol (1 :4), containing 0.01 M ammonium acctate. The stationary phase was a reverse-phase Waters Novapak column (0.39 cmx30 cm). Control experiments were carried out with all-trurwretinoic and cis-retinoic acid standards. X-ray diffraction data collection and processing. The Xray source for data collection was a Sicniens MI 8X-HF rotating anode generator, operated at 50 kV and 90 tnA, with an apparent focus size of0.3 mmX3 mm. Copper radiation was selected by a graphite crystal monochromator. A 0.5-mtn collirnator was used. Data were measured on a XENTRONIX XI000 area detector system, mounted on a three-axis goniorneter. 800 frames were measured, with a crystal to detector distance of 11.0 cm and a detector angle of -27". A rotation of 0.25"/framc and an exposure lime of 80 s were used, for a total of 200" rotation around 10.Scaling and merging was performed with the program SAINT (Siernenh Industrial Automation). No sigma cut-off was applied unci all the reflections were considered observed. Table 1 gives thc statistics of data collcction and the percentage of rcflections measured as a function of resolution. Model building and refinement. The coordinates for native transthyretin (Hamilton et al., 1993), deposited in the Brookhaven Protcin Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977). were used as the starting model in the refinement. Some cycles of restrained leastsquares on atomic coordinates and B factors were performed and ii I2F,,,,, - F,,,, I electron density tnap calculated, using only thc coordinates of protein atoms. Electron density maps were inspected and minor adjustements applied. Solvent molecules were includcd a s water. Only thc peaks close to polar side chains or to other water molecules were considered. In the final mocicl 96 water mnlecules are present, with a mean R factor of 0.5 nm'. On the basis of the electron densities inside the ccntral channel, both thyroxinc-binding sites appeared to be occupied by the retinoic acid ligand. In turn, each site appeared to be bound by two ligand molecules, a feature attributable to the two-fold symmetry of the binding site and the lack of molecular symmetry of the ligand. Therefore, two retinoic acid molecules were fitted i n the electron dcnsity, and included i n the refinement only in the last cycles. Two independent molecules of 1 1 -cis-retinoic acid were refined. On the assumption that approximately one molecule of rctinoic acid was bound/molecule of transthyretin in the crystal, an occupancy factor of 0.25 was held fixed in the refinement. The mean R factors of the atoms of the two ligarld molecules are 0.38 nn? and 0.47 nrn'. In contrast, retinoic acid and solvent molccules were not included in the calculation of the electrondensity maps. Some more cycles of restrained least-squares rcduced the R factors to the final value of 0.196. The refinernent

RESULTS
All-rvclns-retinoic acid (Pig. 1) binds lightly to transthyretin, resulting in a ligand-transthyrctin comples that can be readily crystallized from solutions similar to those uscd for the crystallization of native transthyretin (Bliike et al., 1974). When single crystals were analyzcd by means of the iiiicrospectrophotoiiictric techniyuc, ii peak centered at 337 nm, charactcristic of the transthyretin-bound rctinoic acid, wiis found (Fig. 2).

tion spectra were obtained foi- crystals that had been i n the sitting-drop experiments at room temperature for either two weeks or six months. Therefore, the transthyretin-bound retinoic acid in the crystal is quite stable, a situation typical of crystals of retinoid-binding protcins coniplexed with their natural ligands. On thc basis of absorption coefficients for transthyretin and retinoic acid of approximately 79000 M ' crn ' and approxiinately 45 000 M-' cni I , respectively, a stoichionietry of approximately 0.7 mol retinoid bound/mol transthyretin in the crystal citn be cstimaled from the spectrum presented in Fig. 2. The binding of retinoic acid to transthyretin has no remarkable consequenccs on the structure of the protein, similarly to what was found previously for transthyretin cotnplexcd with other ligands (Ciszak et al., 1992; Wojtczak et al., 1992, 1993). Both the overall protein structure and the ligand-binding sitcs for the retinoic acid-transthyretin complex are approxiinately identical to those of native transthyrctin. Small differences bctween the Ca cotirdinales of our rnodel and that of unliganded transthyretin (Hamilton et al., 1993) can be observed around residues 6-8 (the maximum differences between Cas are 0.08 nm in subunit A and 0.1 nm in subunit B) and residucs 101-103 (the maxirnuiii differences between Crxs are 0.04 n m in subunit A and 0.07 nm i n subunit B). These differences appear to he significant, since they are found in the two independent monomers. Howevcr, since the regions comprising the above residues are far from thc ligand-binding sites and are exposcd lo the solvent, there does not appear to be any ritnctional relevance to this finding. The two independent inonoiners differ at the Ctermini and N-termini and in the region comprising residues 98- 104; these differences are also present in the uncomplexcd protein (Zanotti, G., unpublished results). Regarding the mode of binding of rctinoic acid, electron densities in the difference Fourier map account for four retinoic acid inolecules apparently bound to transthyretin. In fiict, both thyroxine-binding sites appear to be occupied by the ligand, although with an uncertain degree of occupancy. In addition, two positions for retinoic acid appear to be partially superimposed within cach site. To explain these fcatures, it is worth recalling that a crystallographic two-fold axis is coincident with the axis of the central channcl containing the two ligand-binding sites. Tn thc crystal, each site is symmetric and, therefore, a bound ligand that does not possess a rnolccular symmetry diad appears to be prcscnt i n two different positions, relatcd by a rotation axis. This situalion leads to the apparent superposition of two ligand molecules in each binding site. Because of this stutistical disorder intrinsic i n the space-group symmetry, a detailed rnodel for the modc of binding is difficult to obtain. The same limitations have been encountered previously in the case of the deterinination of the crystal slructures ol' corriplexcs ul' transthyretin with thyroxinc m d other ligands (Blake et al., 1974; Wo.jtcziik et al., 1992, 1!193). It is importnnt to notice that the electron density for the two crystallographically independent site. treinely similar, although not identical. The situation of only oile site will therefore hc discussed, since the other can be considcred equivnlent, at least at this level of details. The retinoic acid molecule fits into each thyroxine-binding site of transthyretin with the cyclohexenc ring innermost and the carboxylic end group near the entrance of the channel (Fig. 3). This mode of binding mimics that of 3,3'-diiodo-~-lhyronine and thyroxine, whose phcnolic rings lie deep in the cavity ntid the alanyl moieties are close to the entrance of thc channel. The shape of the ring is quite clear, whilst the two methyl groups in positions 1 and 5 cannot ht: seen. The positions of the methyl subsituents along the isoprene tail are also unclear, particularly because the chains of the two inolecules within each binding sitc cross each other. Nevertheless, it is quite evident that the iso-

A similar situation has been observed previously lor retinoic acid bound to E-RABP; despite the fact that the lipand used was all-trmsrcritioic acid, it was bound to this protein partially a s 9-cis and partially as pseudo-cis (8-cis) isomers (Newcomer et al., 1993; Newcomer, 1093). Due to the aforementioned der, the precise configuration of the isoprene ch thyretin-bound retiiioic acid cannot be delined unambiguously, but il is clearly folded. Thc best fit for the electron density has bcen obtained with the 'I 1-cis-isomer or an X-cis-1 I-cis isomer, the latter exhibiting a torsion angle of 0" about the C8-C9 single bond. The deviation from the all-tmns-configuration for the bound retinoic acid appears to be particularly significant as i1 lcads to a fiivorahle orientation of the carhoxylate. This orientation is such that the negative charge of this group is neutralized through the interaction with the LyslS side chain. Atternpts have been made to establish the nature of the ligand bound to transthyretin in the crystal. Upon solubilixation of the crystals, the holotransthyretin was extracted and analyted for the content of isomers of rctinoic acid. Keverse-phase HPLC resolved the retinoic acid into three main peaks, corresponding to all-trrms, ! k i s and a mixture of 11-cis and 13-cis isoiiiers

(Fig. 5).The 1 1 -cis and 1 3 - c i ~isomers w m u t be resolved well by means of reverse-phase HPLC. Since the I 1-cis isomer possesses a slightly delayed retention time relative to the 13-civ isomer (Heyman et al., 1992), it is likely to reprcsent the predominant componcnt of peak 1 (Fig. 5 ) . This pattern for retinoic acid isomers winewhat resembles that obtained upon extraction of crystals of the retinoic acid-E-KABP complex, which consisted of 13-cis, 9-cis and a l l - t r . m s isomers (Newcomer e l al., 1993). It was suggested that the 13-cis isomer, which was present in a substantiul quantity, could represent a product of light isotrierization of all-[runs-retinoic acid (Newcomer et al., 1993). Thus, in the crystals of both retinoic-acid-lriinsthyretiri and rctinoic-acid-E-RABP, or in the length of time required for the crystitllization of these two complexcs, the all-tmtts rctinoic acid is partly convertcd into cis isomers. In addition, the protein-bound all-truns-isomcr adopts folded conformations that rcsemble those o cis-isomers of retinoic acid. The concornitani presence C of various Corms of retinoic acid bound to transthyretin might be responsiblc for a not particularly good fitting of the ligand

This property has been found previously for some lipid-binding proteins, like E-RABP (Newcomer, 1993) and muscle fatty-acid-binding protein (Young et al., 1994). These proteins are able to force their ligands into otherwise less favorable conformations, since the achicveinent of high conformational energies for protein-bound ligands can be largely compensated by the energy of interaction with residues of the protein. In the case of transthyretin, the isoprene tail of all-tmns-retinoic acid is forced into a folded conformation Fig. 7.

Small crosscs indicate iodine atoms. A peculiar property of the thyroxine-binding sites of transthyretin is the low degree of binding specificity, consistent with thc finding that they can accommodate ligands substantially different froin the thyroid hormones. Therefore, the molecular concompetition of the retinoid with thyroxine, thus indicating that straints responsible for binding affinity and specificity are of a the two ligands bind to the same sites on transthyretin (Smith et rathcr loose type in transthyretin. Quite surprisingly, in competial., 1994). The estimated dissociation constant of the retinoic- tive binding assays we have found that the affinity of all-trunsacid-transthyretin complex (Kp0.1 pM) is about two orders of retinoic acid for a typical retinoid-binding protein like REP is magnitude larger than that of thc complex with thyroxine (Smith not substantially higher than that of the same retinoid for transet al., 1994). The above dissociation constant lies within the thyretin (Malpeli, G., Folli, C. and Berni, R., unpublished rerange of thc dissociation constant values that have been deter- sults). The inode of binding is quite different in the two cases. mined for the complex between transthyretin and products of In the case of RBP, the isoprene chain of the protein-bound retithyroxine deiodination (Andrea et al., 1980; Somack et al., noic acid is in a fully extended conforniation and the carboxylate 1982). The finding that the interactinn of transthyretin with reti- does not participate in ionic interactions with the protein; in no1 is nearly negligible (Smith et al., 1994) is consistent with addition, the hydrogen-bond interactions that involve the retinol the results of our structural investigation, which suggests that hydroxyl group and stabilize the retinol-RBP complex are also lacking in the retinoic acid-RBP complex (Zanotti et al., 1994). the presence of the carboxylatc group is crucial for binding. The crystal structures of transthyretin complexed with 3,3'- Thus, the energy of binding of retinoic acid to RBP is essentially diiodo-L-thyronine (Wojtczak ct al., 1992), milrinonc (Wojtcrak providcd by hydrophobic interactions.
