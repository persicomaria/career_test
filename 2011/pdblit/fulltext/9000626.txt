Protein-nucleic acid interactions by NMR
Robert Kaptein
U t r e c h t University, Utrecht, The Netherlands NMR spectroscopy has been remarkably successful as a tool for elucidating the three-dimensional structures of DNA-binding proteins. Several DNA-binding domains of bacterial repressors and eukaryotic transcription factors, together with, in some cases, their complexes with DNA, have been analyzed by NMR. Highlights of the past year include the structure determination of DNA-binding domains of GAL4 (both by NMR and X-ray crystallography) and of c-Myb, a protein related to the helix-turn-helix family of proteins. Progress has also been made for other classes of DNA-binding protein, most notably for the TFIIIA-like zinc fingers, for which the architectural rules are now well understood.

Introduction
Most gene-regulatory proteins have a modular architecture with distinct domains for various functions such as DNA binding, dimerization, ligand binding and so on. The DNA-binding domains are often rather small, which explains the success of NMR spectroscopy in elucidating the three-dimensional structures of several protein domains of this type. The Lac repressor of Escherichia coli provides an archetypal example. Here, the DNA-binding properties reside in an amino-terminal 'headpiece' of 50-60 amino acid residues, whereas the rest of the protein is responsible for oligomerization and inducer binding. In one of the first protein structure determinations by NMR [ 1 ], the Lac headpiece was shown to have a tri-helical structure containing the well conserved helixturn-helix (HTH) motif, which occurs in a large number of DNA-binding proteins (for a review, see [2]). The Lac repressor-operator system also provided the first exam pie of a protein-DNA complex solved by NMR [3]. This work showed that Lac repressor utilizes mainly the second s-helix (the 'recognition helix') for specific base recognition as do the other HTH proteins (for general reviews, see [4,5]). It was however a surprising result to find that the orientation of this helix with respect to the dyad axis of the operator is reversed compared with that found in other complexes of HTH proteins such as )~-repressor, X-cro, 434 repressor, 434 cro and catabolite gene activator protein. For several families of DNA-binding proteins, structural information first came from NMR spectroscopy, most notably for the zinc-finger domains (vim Berg, this issue, pp 11-16) /6]. Thus, solution structures were solved for TFIIIA-like zinc-finger peptides from Xfin [7] and

ADR1 [8], essentially confirming the structural predictions made by Berg (this issue, pp 11-16) for this class of proteins. Subsequently, a crystallographic study of the Zif268-DNA complex extended this work and showed how zinc fingers participate in DNA recognition [9]. Also, for the family of steroid hormone receptors, NMR structures were determined for the DNA-binding domains of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [10] and estrogen receptor (ER) [11]. Again, an X-ray structure of the GR-DNA complex provided a detailed picture of the protein-DNA interactions [12]. Finally, I should mention the homeodomain as an example of an important class of DNA-binding protein domains, where structural analyses by NMR and X-ray crystallography go hand in hand and often complement each other. The NMR structure determination of the Antennapedia homeodomain [13J was followed by X-ray structures of homeodomain-DNA complexes for engrailed [14J and MAT~z2 [15]. Recently, some gaps in tile crystal structures of homeodomain-DNA complexes were filled in (in this case literally, with water) based on an NMR analysis of the AnWnnapedia homeodomain complex (K WtRhrich, personal communication). I shall review here the past year's harvest in the area of NMR structural work on protein-DNA interactions.

in particular, the packing of hydrophobic residues in the interior of the protein were found to be very similar. Yet differences between the NMR and X-ray structures of 1.1 A for backbone atoms were well outside the precision of the NMR structure determination (,--0.6~). These differences could be traced to crystal-packing effects and differences in solvent conditions. Interestingly, an NMR study of the 434 repressor domain under ureadenatured conditions revealed a structured region for the peptide segment 534;0, which contains a large number of hydrophobic residues [18"]. The conformation of this hydrophobic cluster is different from that in the folded protein and may serve as a nucleation site in the folding pathway of the protein. The E. coli Trp repressor is a dimeric protein with a molecular weight of 25 kD. The crystal structure of a repressor-operator complex is known [19]. It has the remarkable feature that there are no direct interactions present between bases and amino acid side chains that could account for specific base recognition (only a number of water mediated hydrogen bonds). Therefore, for Trio repressor, the mechanism of specificity is still some what puzzling. Several NMR studies have been undertaken to shed light on this issue. Resonance assignments have been made for Trp repressor using either selective [20"] or uniform [21"] isotope enrichments. The lowresolution structure determined [20"] showed the same five-helical fold as observed in the crystal. From the observed large differences in amide proton exchange rates, it was concluded that helices D and E, which constitute the DNA-binding region, are more flexible in solution than is the core of the protein [21"]. This agrees with the picture which has emerged from crystallographic studies [19] suggesting that the repressor uses a flexible 'reading head' to scan the DNA in its search for the operator site. The homeodomain structures have shown that the HTH motif is not only present in bacterial repressors but occurs in eukaryotic transcription factors as well [13-15]. Recently, another example of an HTH-related motif has been found in the protooncogene product c-Myb [22"]. The DNA-binding domain of this transcriptional regulator consists of three tandem repeats of approximately 51 amino acid residues. The structure of the third repeat, which is essential for sequence-specific DNA-binding, was recently determined by NMR methods [22"]. It consists of three a-helices packed together to form a hydrophobic core, in which three tryptophan residues play a prominent role. Triplets of tryptophans separated by 18 or 19 residues also occur in other Myb- and Ets related pro teins, suggesting a structural similarity between these proteins. Helices 2 and 3 form a HTH motif that differs from the canonical one in that the turn is longer by one residue and contains a proline. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the 21-residue HTH segments of c-Myb and 434 repressor is 1.4A, which is much larger than the 0.6~.8A, found for canonical HTH proteins. A similar variation on the HTH theme had previously been reported fbr the LexA repressor o f E. coli [23]. Here, the turn is also longer and contains a proline residue (a full structure determination of the aminoterminal domain of LexA repressor has been carried out by R Fogh in the author's laboratory and will soon be reported (R Fogh, personal communication). The interaction of LexA repressor with a consensus halfoperator sequence was studied by NMR spectroscopy [24-]. The DNA amino protons of the central CTGT region of the operator showed large chemical shift displacements upon formation of the protein DNA complex, underscoring the important role for this segment in the recognition process. An NMR analysis of a mutant Lac repressor headpiece with isoleucine replacing Tyr7 has also been reported [25"]. Although the overall folding of the mutant was found to be similar to that of wild-type Lac headpiece, the mutation destabilized helices 1 and 2. This points to a stabilizing role of the interaction between Tyr7 and Tyr17 in the wild-type repressor. DNA binding by the Tyr711e mutant to a 14 bp symmetric Lac operator was found to be nearly identical to that of wild-type Lac headpiece [26-]. 31p chemical shifts monitored during complex formation with different 14 bp operator fragments led the authors to the somewhat unconventional conclusion that the conformational backbone flexibility of DNA is retained in specific, tight-binding complexes, whereas conformational freedom is reduced in weak-binding complexes [26.]. A potential problem with this work is that the minimum size Lac operator is 18 bp rather than 14 bp, and a few protein-DNA contacts are absent in complexes with the shorter oligonuclotides. An interesting mutant was engineered for ~v-cro repressor, with a cTsteine residue replacing Va155 in the [3-sheet that forms the dimer interface [27"]. This mutant protein spontaneously forms a disulphide-bridged dimer. Although the conformation is the same as- that of wildtype cro repressor, the affinity towards operator DNA is reduced. A spectroscopic study involving circular dichroism (CD) and photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) revealed the reason for this difference [27"]. Apparently, the conformational change necessary for tight binding (probably a 'scissors grip' like motion of the subunits in the cro dimer) is prohibited by the disulphide bond in the mutant repressor.

Zinc-finger proteins
There are now so many structures Mlown for zinc-finger peptides of the TFIIIA-type (JM Berg, this issue, p p l l - 1 6 ) [6-9[ that architectural rules can be formulated and correlations made with spectroscopic data. Thus, among a group of 11 zinc-finger peptides, chemical shifts of several residues have similar characteristic values which appear to be independent of their sequence [28"]. On the basis of three-dimensional structure, the zinc-finger shifts can be calculated with an accuracy of ~ 0.2 and 0.6 p p m for backbone C a H and NH protons, respectively [29"]. These chemical shifts are diagnostic for a folded structure of the zinc-bound form, which consists of an

amino-terminal [3-sheet, a carboxy-terminal a-helix, and a highly ordered hydrophobic/aromatic core. It had been noted that one of the conserved core aromatic residues (phenylalanine or tyrosine) occurs either at position 10 or 12 in the peptide sequence [28.-31.,32.,], suggesting alternative packing arrangements in the hydrophobic core. These aromatic interactions have been systematically investigated using mutagenesis and NMR analysis for the zinc-finger domains of the human male-associated protein ZFY [30",31"]. Swapping experiments between residues found in the central core of odd- and even-numbered ZFY fingers showed that the CC/HH zinc-finger framework may accomodate alternative folding patterns involving the central aromatic residue that are of equivalent thermodynamic stability [32"']. The smallest zinc-finger subclass is that of the retroviral proteins encoded by the g a g genes. These CC/HC-type (Zn coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine) fingers have a short central loop of only four residues. A synthetic 39-residue peptide containing the two-finger region of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein was analyzed by NMR [33"J. The peptide is unstructured in the absence of Zn(lI) but folds in its presence into two domains connected by a flexible heptapeptide linker. The folded finger domains are structurally very similar to the single-domain peptides of this subclass determined previously by NMR [34]. It is noteworthy that there appears to be a wide range of mutual interactions between zinc fingers in multifinger domains. These interactions vary from the virtual absence of any interaction in the retroviral CC/HC fingers [33"] to strong interactions in the two-finger nuclear hormone receptor domains, which should in fact be considered as single folded protein domains [10-12]. The behaviour of TFIIIA-like CC/HH fingers is somewhere between these extremes. The crystal structure of Zif268 shows hydrogen bonding between adjacent fingers [91, and solution data on a double-finger fragment of the human enhancer binding protein also indicate the presence of some interactions between fingers and somewhat restricted relative mobility (unpublished data reported in [33"]). Some progress has been made in the structural characterization of nuclear hormone receptor domains and their interaction with DNA. Having substituted zinc with cadmium in the GR domain, 113Cd NMR unambiguously es tablished which eight out of the nine conserved cysteine residues are involved in metal coordination [35"]. The role of the ninth conserved cysteine (number 500 in the GR sequence) remains a mystery. In a two-dimensional NMR study of the GR-DNA interaction, the monomeric GR DNA-binding domain was shown to form a stable complex with a 10 bp hag-site glucocorticoid response element (GRE) [36"]. Several nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between protein and DNA were observed (notably those involving Val462 in the P-box and Tyr452), which were all consistent with both the model for the protein-DNA complex proposed by H/ird et al. [10] and the crystal structure of the complex with a full GRE [12]. A conformational change appears to occur in the second finger region upon DNA binding, as deduced from differences observed in the solution and crystal structures of the complex [10,12]. Future NMR work on complexes with half-site and full GREs may shed some light on the nature of this change. Another important subclass of Zn-binding proteins comprises the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4 and related proteins, which contain a bimetallic cluster of two Zn ions coordinated by six cysteine residues [6]. A burst of activity in this area during the past year yielded two independent NMR structures of the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 [37*',38"] and the crystal structure of the complex with a 17bp DNA fragment correspond ing to the consensus galactose upstream activating sequence (UASO [39"]. In the solution studies of both the Zn(II)-bound [37"'] and the Cd(II)-bound [38"] proteins, it was found that only residues 10-40 form a well defined structural domain (see Fig. 1). An interest ing novel feature of the structure is the internal pseudodyad axis, which passes between the two a-helices and through the center of the zinc cluster. A concentration of basic residues on one side of the domain suggests a DNA-binding site. This is born out by the crystal structure of the protein-DNA complex [39"" ]. One a-helix (the one on the right side in Fig.l) inserts in the major groove, and the basic residues make hydrogen bonds either with the phosphate backbone (Arg15, Lys20, Lys23) or with the bases (Lysl7 and Lysl8). Part of the dimerization interface is seen in the crystal structure of the DNA complex of GAL4 (1-65) and is of the parallel coiled coil type, involving residues 5044. This region is unstructured in solution. An unanswered question is why are only six out of the 17 base pairs of the UASo recog nized by the protein? It is possible that the specificity is increased by other proteins that interact with GAL4 and with other parts of the transcriptional machinery.

teucine zippers
A number of eukaryotic transcription factors such as GCN4, C/EBP, CREB and the heterodimer Fos/Jun contain a dimerization interface characterized by a heptad repeat of leucine residues called a 'leucine zipper' [40,41 ]. As these proteins also contain a region of basic amino acid residues involved in DNA binding, they are now often designated as the bZip family (b for basic region). A crystal structure of the 33-residue leucine zipper of GCN4 showed it to be a parallel, two stranded coiled coil [42"*], The packing of the a-helices conforms closely to the 'knobs into holes' model proposed by Francis Crick some 40 years ago! A striking periodicity was observed in the H/D exchange of amide protons for the GCN4 leucine zipper [43"]. This could be correlated with the length of the hydrogen bonds, being shorter in the hydrophobic interface between the helices. This variation in hydrogen-bond length would also produce a curvature of the helices leading to the observed left-handed supercoiled structure [42"],

A full structure determination by NMR has also been attempted for the GCN4 leucine-zipper peptide [44"], but because of difficulties in observing interhelical NOEs in a symmetric coiled coil, only the single-helical structure could be determined. The basic region is known to be unstructured in solution, but forms a helix when bound to DNA [41]. A combined NMR and CD study of a number of synthetic peptides corresponding to the GCN4 basic region showed that relatively small peptides of 20 residues form stable complexes with DNA in which they adopt an a-helical conformation [45"]. Specific DNA binding may involve only 15 residues. The crystal structure of a GCN4-bZip-DNA complex has recently been solved (T Ellenberger, personal communication). The structure is rather similar to the 'induced helical fork' model [46] in which the basic region forms a continuous helix with the leucine-zipper helix, rather than showing a kink as in the 'scissors grip' model [47].

Conclusions

DNA-binding proteins provide several examples of the complementary information obtainable from solution studies by NMR on the one hand and X-ray crystallography on the other. In particular, the potential of NMR to characterize not only structure but also dynamic be haviour of biomolecules is important in this respect. If the recognition of DNA sequences by proteins can be described at all by a 'lock-and-key' process, it is certainly a very rubbery key inserted into an extremely flexible DNA lock. There are many instances of proteins that undergo conformational changes when binding to DNA, and peptide segments often show transitions from flexible random coils to highly ordered structures in the DNA-bound form. This happens, for instance, for the amino-terminal arm of the homeodomain [13,14], for the dimerization domain of GAL4 [38°.,39 ' ' ] and for the basic region of GCN4 and other proteins of the bZip family [41 ]. The steroid hormone receptors show a more subtle

conformational change upon DNA binding and dimerization [10--12], which needs some further characterization. X-ray and NMR studies have come a long way in specifying the various interactions in protein-DNA complexes. It is clear however that consideration of the changes in conformation and flexibility upon complex formation is also necessary for a full understanding of the recognition processes between proteins and DNA.

Studies of DNA Recognition by the Glucocorticoid Receptor: Complex of the DNA Binding Domain with a Half-site Response Element. Biochernist~ 1991, 30:11620-11624. The GR DNA-binding domain binds as a monomer to a half site GRE. The pattern of observed protein DNA NOEs shows that the structure of the complex is similar to that of the crystal structure of the dimeric complex with a full GRE [12]. KRAULISPJ, RMNE ARC, GA~)HA\I PL, LAtIE El): Structure of the DNA-binding Domain of Zinc GAIA. Nature 1992, 356:448-450. The solution structure for GAL4 (residues 7 4 9 ) is reported. The structured region (residues 10-40) is well determined by the NMR constraints (RMSD = 0.35A for the backbone atoms). A striking feature is the internal symmetry of the structure, with a dyad axis passing through the Zn2Cx~s cluster (see Fig. 1 ). 6 BAIj'2jA JD, MARMORSTEIN R, HARRISONSC, WAGNERG: Solution Structure of the DNA-binding Domain of Cd2-GAL4 from S. cerevisiae.
