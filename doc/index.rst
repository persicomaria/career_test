career documentation
====================

These are github Pages inspired to ``Janus``, the Roman god of beginnings, endings, and transitions.
Due to the fact that it is often depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions (to represent the past and future) 
it seems to me appropriated to get inspired by this mythological figure in describing both my past professional experiences 
in Bioinformatics together with my future goals and new ideas about further developments of my previous projects.
