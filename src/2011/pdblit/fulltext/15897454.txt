he availability of the complete sequence of an increasing number of genomes allows comparative analyses aimed at the identification of genes and of corresponding physiological functions conserved along evolution. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a ubiquitous family of enzymes that efficiently catalyze the dismutation of superoxide anions into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide (1, 2). The protein takes a classical Greek key -barrel fold and adopts a dimeric quaternary structure (3). It binds one Zn and one Cu ion per subunit, the latter ion being the site of the enzymatic reaction, whose rate limiting step is the diffusion of superoxide through the channel that leads to the Cu site (4). SOD has been considered for a long time to be peculiar of eukaryotic organisms, in which its evolutionary rate has been studied (5). From the first description of a SOD activity in Escherichia coli (6), other putative homologous of the eukaryotic protein have been then found in the periplasmic space of other bacterial species (7) The x-ray structures have been solved for the proteins from Photobacterium leiognathi (8), E. coli (9), Salmonella typhimurium (10), and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (11), all of them maintaining the typical metal sites of Cu,Zn eukaryotic SODs and normal SOD activity. With the aim of providing a more detailed picture of prokaryotic SODs, we browsed the available complete genomes of Archea and Bacteria to search for sequences with some degree of homology with human SOD (HSOD), which is found in 48 of the 138 prokaryotes with complete genome. In some of them, not all of the metal ligands are present. The SOD-like protein from Bacillus subtilis (BsSOD) lacks two binding-Cu residues (His-48 and His-63, human protein numbering), and because of this peculiarity, we focused on it. Even if BsSOD shares sequence identity ranging 30­45% with the other bacterial SOD-like proteins and

constructed by amplifying the BsSOD ORF starting from residues 22­196 (we removed the first 21 aa, which correspond to a signal peptide sequence) by PCR using B. subtilis genomic DNA as template. The gene was cloned between HindIII and SalI sites of the same vector that was already used for the expression of HSOD (17). The correct DNA sequence of the obtained construct was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Protein production and isolation, also for 15N- and 13C-15Nlabeled samples, was performed as reported for HSOD (17, 18). The isolated protein contains the fragment of amino acids 35­196. The protein was obtained in good yield ( 50 mg liter culture). The Cu and Zn content was checked through atomic absorption analysis with a GBC 903 instrument. ES-MS spectra were taken with an ESI-TOF Mariner mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in denaturing conditions at pH 1. The presence of the disulphide bond was checked through reaction with 4-acetamido-4 -maleimidylstulbene-2,2 -disulfonic acid, disodium salt (19). Gel-filtration chromatography was used to determine the aggregation state. NMR samples ( 2 mM) were in unbuffered water solution.

BIOPHYSICS

Little is known about prokaryotic homologs of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme highly conserved among eukaryotic species. In 138 Archaea and Bacteria genomes, 57 of these putative homologs were found, 11 of which lack at least one of the metal ligands. Both the solution and the crystal structures of the SOD-like protein from Bacillus subtilis, lacking two Cu ligands and found to be enzymatically inactive, were determined. In solution, the protein is monomeric. The available nuclear Overhauser effects, together with chemical-shift index values, allowed us to define and to recognize the typical Cu,Zn SOD Greek -barrel but with largely unstructured loops (which, therefore, sample a wide range of conformations). On the contrary, in the crystal structure (obtained in the presence of slight excess of Zn), the protein is well structured and organized in covalent dimers held by a symmetric bridge consisting of a Zn ion bound to an Asp­His dyad in a tetrahedral geometry. Couples of dimers held by hydrophobic interactions and H bonds are further organized in long chains. The order disorder transition is discussed in terms of metal binding and physical state.

27% with HSOD, the absence of two of the Cu-binding His residues suggests that the protein does not behave as a real SOD. We have expressed and structurally characterized it by means of NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. The unique structural features and differences of this protein in solution and in the solid state, together with the sequence analysis of the prokaryotic homologs, is instructive with respect to the factors determining the folding status of a protein.

sequences were performed with the programs BLAST (12) and (13), respectively. The programs DAS and SIGNALP, as well as the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes Proteins) web server, were used to detect transmembrane fragments, signal-peptide sequences, and possible functional associations or fusions with other proteins, respectively (14­16).

information on the PNAS web site, following a standard procedure as in ref. 18. Structural constraints were constituted by nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE)-derived upper distance limit, and torsion-angle constraints obtained from HNHB, HNHA experiments, the intensity rate between the d N(i-1,i) and dN (i,i) NOEs peaks, and the Chemical Shift Index. Structure calculations were performed with the program DYANA (20), either without the introduction of the Zn ion or with a Zn ion bound to the residues conserved with respect to HSOD. Amide proton exchange, in the range of 0.3­100 s 1, was monitored by using a 15N-(CLEANEX-PM) fast heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiment (21). R1 and R2 15N relaxation rates and 1H-15N NOEs (with and without 1H saturation), were measured at 298 K on a 600-MHz Avance spectrometer (Bruker) and then normalized by using a standard procedure (22). The 15N backbone transverse relaxation rates, R2, were also measured as a function of the refocusing delay in the Carr­Purcell­Meiboom­Gill (CPMG) sequence, as described (23).
Protein Crystallization and X-Ray Structure Determination. Diffrac-

tion-quality single crystals of BsSOD of sizes varying from 0.05 to 0.15 mm were obtained by the sitting-drop setup. Only by adding Zn ions in slight excess with respect to the native 1:1 BsSOD Zn ratio, crystal growth occurs and is reproducibly achieved. A Single-Wavelength Anomalous Diffraction experiment at the Zn edge was performed by the rotation method at ELETTRA XRD-1 beamline at 100 K (Trieste, Italy). The crystal diffracted up to a 1.7-Å resolution and belongs to space group P1 (a 38.22 Å, b 61.11 Å, c 64.92 Å, 84.35, 76.02, and 90.42), with four protein molecules in the cell and a solvent content of 44%. Results
Sequence Analysis. A systematic BLAST search within the genomes

of prokaryotic organisms was performed, starting from HSOD, for the sequences sharing 20% with any of the others. A total of 57 sequences have been retrieved (see Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site) in 48 organisms. Among them, only one (Methanosarcina acetivorans), with 32% identity with HSOD, was found in the 16 completely sequenced Archaea. The presence of two or three homologous sequences in the same organism might indicate a gene-duplication event. A transmembrane -helix was predicted for 9 of the 57 proteins (16%), whereas most of the others [45 (79%)] should be putative secretory proteins for the presence of an N-terminal secretory signal peptide. The other proteins are cytoplasmatic proteins. No significant functional association of any of these proteins with other proteins could be predicted by the analysis of genome cooccurence, gene proximity, or gene fusion. Eleven sequences in nine organisms lack one or more ligands in either Cu or Zn or both metal-binding sites. In organisms with more than one homologous sequence, the metal-binding site is either always conserved, or metal ligands are missing in all sequences. In the protein from B. subtilis, BsSOD, His-48 (human protein numbering is used throughout this analysis) of the Cu domain, and His-63 (which, in the eukaryotic proteins, bridges the Cu and the Zn ions) are substituted by Tyr and Pro, respectively. Substitution of His-63 with a Phe is present in proteins from Corynebacterium efficiens, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium paratubercolosis, and Mycobacterium tubercolosis. His-71 (Zn site) is not conserved in the proteins from C. efficiens, M. leprae, and M. paratubercolosis. His-46 is substituted by Gln in one of the sequences from M. paratubercolosis. Substitutions on His-80 (Zn site) occur in Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus,
7542 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0502450102

Caulobacter crescentus, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, M. leprae, M. tubercolosis, and M. paraturbercolosis; the SOD from M. leprae lacks another ligand of the Zn site (Asp-83). His-120 (Cu site) is not present in the sequence of SODs from B. anthracis and B. cereus, where it is replaced by a Thr. No correlation exists between the disruption of the active-site ligands and the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide. A phylogenetic tree, based on these proteins sequences (see Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), clearly divides the bacterial SOD-like sequences in two major branches. The species lacking metal-binding residues belong to one of the two major branches and cluster into three groups of sequence homology, represented by C. efficiens, M. leprae, M. paratubercolosis, M. tubercolosis (first group), B. subtilis, B. anthracis, B. cereus, (second group), C. crescentus, and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum (third group). The branch points from which these groups originate are very close to the root point. The gene-duplication events have been conservative with respect to the lack of metal-binding residues. Asp-124, an invariant residue in eukaryotic proteins that is involved in correctly orienting the Cu and the Zn ligand residues (His-46 and His-71, respectively) (24) is conserved in all of the bacterial sequences except M. paratubercolosis. Arg-143, which enhances the diffusion of O2 to the active site (25), is always present, except in C. acetobutylicum, where there is a Lys (a residue with the same charge as Arg). SOD from Clostridium acetobutylicum maintains all of the metal ligands, thus suggesting that it may have SOD activity. Indeed, substitution of Arg-143 with Lys on HSOD produces a relatively active enzyme (25). The residues forming the electrostatic loop are conserved only partially among the species. Particularly, amino acids in positions 133, 136, and 137 show a marked variability in charge and or hydrophobicity within the bacterial sequences at variance with the eukaryotic proteins. The overall protein charge per subunit (which, excluding the metal ions, is 6 in HSOD) ranges in prokaryotes from 38 to 5. Residues located at the subunit interface in the dimeric eukaryotic proteins are partially conserved in these prokaryotic homologues. In particular, the hydrophobic residues Phe-50 and Gly-51, essential for stabilizing a dimeric form (26), are present in prokaryotic SODs in only a few cases. In E. coli (9) and in B. subtilis (this article), which are monomeric in solution, there is a Lys at position 51. This charged group could be determinant for preventing occurrence of the quaternary structure. The two Cys residues involved in the disulphide bond in eukaryotic proteins (Cys-57 and Cys-146) are also present in all of the prokaryotic homologues. However, in all of the prokaryotic proteins, the N-terminal Cys is aligned to residue 53, instead of residue 57 (Fig. 5).
Protein Expression and Characterization of BsSOD. The protein from

B. subtilis is constituted by 196 residues, the first 21 of which are predicted to be a transmembrane fragment corresponding to the N-terminal signal peptide. The soluble domain of the protein from B. subtilis, corresponding to the C-terminal 175 aa (from Lys-22 to Gln-196; theoretical mass, 18,714 Da), that is expressed in E. coli has an experimental mass of 17,236 Da (estimated error, 0.05%). The difference between expected and experimental mass matches the mass of the 13 N-terminal residues. They might have been clipped by proteolytic cleavage, which occurs only for flexible regions of the polypeptide chain (27) and, thus, suggests that the N-terminal sequence is in a mobile and exposed conformation. Therefore, the first N-terminal residue of the isolated protein is Val-35, resulting in a protein that is 162 aa in length. Gel-filtration experiments on a standardized column show that the protein is monomeric. BsSOD does not contain Cu, but it binds 1 mol of Zn per mol of protein.

standard procedure used for HSOD (28) was unsuccessful. Consistent with the lack of Cu, the protein does not present any SOD activity, as experimentally checked with Fridovich's method (2). A biochemical assay (see Experimental Procedures) revealed the absence of free sulfydryl groups.
Structural Characterization in Solution. The 1H-15N HSQC spec-

trum of BsSOD (fragment of amino acids 35­196) shows a good dispersion of the signals, indicating that the entire protein is in a folded state (see Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The quality of the spectrum is not affected significantly by temperature, pH, ionic strength, or protein concentration. The resonance assignment (see Table 2, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), achieved by means of triple-resonance NMR experiments, is essentially complete (92% 1H, 91% 13C, and 95.5% 15N; calculated on the assigned region from residues 35­192). As determined from CLEANEX spectra (21), 31 backbone amide protons of the 150 NH detected signals exchange with the bulk solvent in the time range of 0.3­100 s 1. These signals arise from residues (except Gly-84 and Ala-74) that are located in loop regions or at the edge of -strands. Structural restraints were constituted by dihedral angles (38 and 42 dihedral angles) (see Tables 3 and 4, which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site), by Chemical Shift Index and NOE-derived upper distance limits (1,450 of which 1,051 are meaningful; see Fig. 8 and Table 5, which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The meaningful NOEs are 6.5 per residue, compared with 15­20 per proteins of this size (29). The low number of longrange NOEs (281 of the 1,051 meaningful NOEs) is particularly relevant, detected essentially only between -strands, which on average have 8.2 meaningful NOE restraints. The calculated structural model has an average RMS deviation (RMSD) value to the mean structure (for residues 45­91 and 123­189) of 2.32 0.53 Å for the backbone and 3.06 0.48 Å for the heavy atoms. The RMSD values decrease to 1.53 0.21 Å and 2.32 0.23 Å for backbone and heavy atoms, respectively, when calculated on the secondary structure elements. The solution structure is shown in Fig. 1. When the calculations are performed by applying links between the Zn ion and His-112, His-121, and Asp-124 (which, based on the sequence alignment, are the putative Zn ligands), a structure with comparable target function and RMSD values is obtained. The BsSOD fold consists of eight -strands, involving 58 residues
Banci et al.

(36%) that are organized in a Greek key -barrel, thus showing the typical SOD fold. The loops are much less defined than the secondary structure elements. The long loop IV and the electrostatic loop VII, forming the channel of access to the Zn ion, are quite disordered, spanning a large range of conformations. Protein mobility can be characterized experimentally by 15N relaxation data. Reliable values of 15N R1 and R2 and 1H-15N NOE were obtained for 120 residues of the 142 assigned backbone NH resonances (see Fig. 9A, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The average values of R1, R2, and NOE are 1.37 0.20 s 1, 10.5 0.9 s 1, and 0.87 0.06, respectively. The latter value, which has a very limited scattering, is consistent with a well folded, stable protein. The correlation time for the protein tumbling, as estimated from the R2 R1 ratio, is 10.0 0.7 ns. This value compares with 8.4 0.3 ns found for the Cu-free monomeric HSOD (30), which comprises 153 residues with respect to 162 of the present construct. It is also consistent with the values found for proteins of similar size (31, 32). Addition of 1.0 equivalent of Zn2 to Zn BsSOD does not produce any significant aggregation of the protein, as indicated by the reorientational correlation time equal to 10.5 1.1 ns, identical to that in absence of exogenous Zn, which is 10.0 0.7 ns. The relaxation rates were analyzed in terms of the spectraldensity-function components, which differently contribute to the relaxation rates and are differently affected by motions occurring on different time scales (33). The relaxation rates and the heteronuclear NOE values have relatively similar values along the protein, with a few exceptions. They are also not affected by decreasing the temperature, except for the expected increase in the reorientational correlation time. A few residues (10 of 128) experience a small contribution to transverse relaxation, as it results from Carr­Purcell­Meiboom­Gill (CPMG) measurements, in which they sample motions of 1­10 ms. These residues are only 8%, scattered over the entire protein. All of the loops are characterized by slightly larger mobility in the picosecond­ nanosecond time scale with respect to the secondary structure elements, but the overall relaxation data point at an essential rigid protein. A similar behavior was observed for Cu-free monomeric HSOD (i.e., in the same metalation state) (30). These dynamic properties are puzzling. The 1H-15N NOEs indicate that the correlation time for each NH vector is essentially determined by the protein tumbling rate. Consistently, the expected number of short range proton­proton NOEs, which would be the most affected by fast local motions, is in agreement with the observed number. Therefore, these data essentially rule out the presence of significative fast internal motions. Also, R2 are quite homogenous and consistent with the protein size, thus ruling out the presence of conformational exchange processes in the millisecond time scale. These mobility data and the large chemical-shift dispersion (which are typical of a well folded, rigid protein) are in contrast with the absence of long range proton­ proton NOEs. When 1H-15N NOEs of this protein (0.87 0.06 average value) are compared with those of HSOD at various degrees of metallation, we find that the average values are similar to those of well folded proteins (e.g., 0.81 0.10 and 0.79 0.10 for the fully metallated and the Cu-depleted monomeric HSOD) (51, 52). However, in HSODs, both fully or partially metallated, the number of long-range NOEs is in the normal range expected for proteins of their size, and indeed, the structures have no specific disordered regions. When both metals are removed, the odd loops experience a dramatic increase in flexibility and disorder, which leads to a sizable decrease in the number of long-range proton­proton NOEs but also to negative 1H-15N NOEs. Still, the structure is better resolved than in BsSOD. The NMR properties of BsSOD indicate a disordered state for most of the protein, characterized by well defined secondary structure elePNAS May 24, 2005 vol. 102 no. 21 7543

ments, but with a fluxional tertiary structure, typically determined by a low number of long-range NOEs (34). Possibly, the residues span a quite broad range of conformations, thus giving rise to weak, average long-range interactions. The absence of any significant exchange contribution to transverse relaxation indicates that the protein flexibility should occur in a range slower than the average tumbling rate but faster than the differences in chemical shifts (i.e., 108­103 s 1).
Structural Characterization in the Crystal. The crystal structure of

BsSOD, besides one Zn ion bound the protein metal site, shows the presence of a second, exogenous Zn ion bound at the interface between two BsSOD molecules, leading to the formation of covalently bound BsSOD dimers (Fig. 2). In the crystal, the total Zn BsSOD ratio is 1.5. Indeed, BsSOD crystallizes only in presence of low concentrations of added Zn(II) salts (see Experimental Procedures). Contrary to the solution structure, the crystal structure shows completely ordered protein molecules, as indicated by the well defined electron density in all protein regions. The first five N-terminal and the last six C-terminal amino acids of the BsSOD isolated protein (residues 35­196) are not visible in the electrondensity maps, consistent with conformational disorder in the two termini, as it also occurs in solution, indicated by the lack of NOE for the same residues. The P1 cell contains four independent molecules of the protein, assembled in homodimers. The two homodimers adopt the same backbone conformation, being the backbone RMSD among the four monomers 0.50­0.59 Å. The exogenous Zn ion at the interface is tightly bound to a tetrahedral binding site created by His-71 and Asp-137 from each monomer (see Fig. 10a, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Water molecules or other potential ligands are not present in the Zn coordination. The intermolecular interaction is reinforced by the presence of two mutual H bonds between the Asp-137 O atoms not involved in the metal coordination and the side chains of Ser-73 of the facing monomer. Other numerous intermolecular H bonds are all mediated by intervening water molecules. Further intersubunit contacts involve only Phe-41 and Ile-139. The possible unfavorable interactions at the dimer interface, due to the facing negative side chains of the two Asp-64 residues from opposite monomers, are relieved by establishing intramonomer H bonds with the Lys-61 side chains. The monomer­monomer contacts involve the first three N-terminal -strands (strands 1­ 3) and strand 6.
7544 www.pnas.org cgi doi 10.1073 pnas.0502450102

The contact interface of eukaryotic dimeric SOD comprises the first seven N-terminal residues, the C-terminal strand 8, and several residues from loops IV and VI, resulting in 90° rotation of the relative orientation of BsSOD monomers with respect to HSOD. The buried surface area involved in the BsSOD dimer is small ( 290 Å2) compared with that of eukaryotic Cu,Zn SOD ( 700 Å2), suggesting that the main interaction leading to the dimer formation is the Zn coordination. Comparison with the other dimeric prokaryotic SODs for which a structure is available (A. pleuropneumoniae, PDB ID code 2APS; P. leiognathi, PDB ID code 1BZO; S. typhimurium, PDB ID code 1EQW) shows that the monomer­monomer interface in BsSOD is also different from any of the other prokaryotic SODs. Also, note that the prokaryotic interfaces are all different from the eukaryotic interfaces and, somehow, different from each other (see Fig. 11, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Weaker interdimer interactions are also present in BsSOD, determined by two direct intermolecular H bonds (Gly-52 O­Asn-179 N ; Arg-95 NH2­Thr-174 O ), one hydrophobic interaction (Val-94 C ­Ala-169 C 2) and several watermediated H bonds. These interactions occur with the BsSOD dimers aligned parallel to their symmetry axis and lead to a one-dimensional arrangement of the BsSOD molecules in the crystal, thus forming long chains of molecules (Fig. 3). In each BsSOD molecule, one Zn ion is bound to the canonical Zn-binding site of SODs to His-112, His-121, and Asp-124 (see Fig. 10b). Zn(II) achieves a tetrahedral coordination by binding a Cl ion located exactly at the same place of the His-63 N 1 of HSOD (Fig. 4A). Despite the presence of His-86 and His-166, which are spatially homologous to the Cu ligands His-46 and His-120 in HSOD, BsSOD misses the Cu-binding site because of the lack of His-48 and His-63 (human numbering), the latter histidine providing the imidazolate bridge between Cu and Zn. In BsSOD, these residues are replaced by Tyr-88 and Pro-104, respectively. The Tyr-88, the OH group is H bonded to both His-86 and His-166, approximately occupying the Cu site of SOD (Fig. 4A). This arrangement suggests that this site still has the tendency to bind Lewis acids, but the bulky side chain of Tyr-88, constrained by the backbone fold around it, is forced to occupy the place, leaving no space for metal ions to reach that potential binding site. Discussion BsSOD displays the characteristic Cu,Zn SOD Greek key -barrel fold made of eight antiparallel -strands connected by seven loops. On average, both in the crystal and in the solution structures, BsSOD has shorter -strands than eukaryotic proteins and shows differences in the relative orientations of some -strands. The backbone RMSD between the solid and solution structure is 1.26 Å, indicating a substantial similarity that is

amazingly high in the -barrel region. Larger deviations occur for the Gly-91­Ala-101 and Glu-111­His-121 of loop IV; the Asn-154­Asp-159 of loop VI; and, last, the Tyr-172­Ser-177 in loop VII. Loop IV hosts Cys-93, which forms a disulfide bond with Cys-186, analogously to HSOD. All of the loops are well defined in the crystal, at variance with the solution structure, and the temperature factors are all within the normal range for ordered structures (on average, 37.5 Å2) and for the loops disordered in solution (only 15% higher). In the crystal, BsSOD loop IV (residues Glu-89­Leu-125) has a complex structure that is divided in two regions by a short segment of 3 aa (Gly-103­Phe-105) adopting a -structure, which folds over strand 8, forming an external addition to the -barrel. Comparison with HSOD (Fig. 4B) (35) shows that loop IV adopts the same overall conformation but with a more extended structure. The comparison between solution and crystal structures of this BsSOD highlights a remarkable transition from a largely fluxional, disordered state in solution to a rigid conformation in the crystal. In solution, BsSOD is an unstructured protein endowed with clear secondary structure elements that fluctuate in many different tertiary conformations. This property, once considered typical only of the prefolded states (molten globules) of normally fully folded proteins, is increasingly being recognized as an intrinsic property of the proteome (36). There are several known examples of proteins lacking intrinsic globular structures or endowed with long disordered segments under physiological conditions, which become suddenly folded, ``freezed'' in one of the possible conformations upon binding to target molecules (36). This property is seen as a sort of operational plasticity that allows the protein to fulfill different biological roles, as promoting macromolecular self-assembly (37), allowing DNA (38) or RNA (39) binding or mediating protein binding in signal transduction or membrane transport (36). It is possible that BsSOD and the other identified bacterial SOD

proteins lacking metal-coordination ability perform in these cells a function that depends on the coupling of folding and binding. The dramatic change in the conformational properties of BsSOD between solution and the crystal are essentially triggered by the binding of an exogenous Zn by two BsSOD molecules in the crystal as well as by packing interactions. These two conditions induce protein dimerization and molecular rigidity. The molecule­molecule interactions, mediated by Zn, involve two strands, 3 and 6. This latter strand is one of the two strands at the edge of a sheet present in the SOD -barrel (the other being strand 5) that are thought to be involved in amyloid fibril formation through intermolecular aggregation with other edge strands in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS)-related mutants (35). Consistent with this type of interaction, the dimeric units of BsSOD tend to interact with each other in the crystal, thus forming a chain of molecules. These types of weak intermolecular interactions are another example of possible mode of protein aggregation, and again, they point to the tendency of the SOD dimers to reorganize in supramolecular aggregates upon small perturbations. The possible appearance of the metal-binding variants from ancestral SOD proteins in the genomes of the bacterial species could have generated an evolutionarily successful enzymatic property that is conserved in all eukaryotic genomes up to man. Therefore, the first ``price'' payed for this transition could have been the loss of the original function of these proteins. Furthermore, mutants lacking the BsSOD coding gene (yojM) are viable, and do not show neither growth difference in normal conditions. BsSOD coding gene is not silent, because the corresponding mRNA is detected in DNA arrays (Jennifer Cavet, personal communication). SODs in terms of sequence, structure, and function, our survey on prokaryotic homologs reveals instead a clear discontinuity, showing that the protein is almost always lacking in Archae, it is lacking in some Bacteria, it is present in other Bacteria but putatively unable to bind Zn and or Cu, and it is present and likely to be functional in the remaining Bacteria species. This finding suggests the possibility of an evolutionary gradient toward the appearance of the functional SOD on the basis of a not functional ancestral SOD-like protein. The NMR properties of the BsSOD indicate a conformational mobility for most of the protein, characterized by defined secondary-structure elements and a fluxional tertiary structure. On the contrary, the x-ray crystal structure shows the well ordered tertiary structure typical of functional SOD and a dimeric quaternary structure obtained by the binding of one exogenous Zn ion, with the latter interaction being most probably responsible for the fluxional-to-native transition. Together, these unusual structural features of a prokaryotic SOD-like protein and the possible evolutionary clues mentioned above are information that may be relevant also for a correct framing of the several, peculiar facets of HSOD.
