Abstract The TNF family member BAFF is a fundamental survival factor for B cells. BAFF binds to three receptors, only one of which, BAFF-R, does not cross-react with the BAFF-related ligand APRIL. The survival function of BAFF on B cells is mediated mainly by BAFF-R and is particularly effective in transitional B cells. BAFF depletion leads to a considerable decrease in mature B cells, without apparent effect on B cell genesis. Consistently, BAFF overexpression results in an expanded B cell compartment and autoimmunity in mice. Elevated amounts of BAFF can be found in the serum of patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. The BAFF system is a promising target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. # 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Most cell die in the absence of appropriate growth and survival signals. This default death pathway provides efficient protection against potentially dangerous processes such as autoimmunity and cellular transformation. In the immune system, where expansion of cell population in response to pathogens and subsequent down-regulation of the response occurs permanently, homeostasis is critically dependent on the balance between survival and death. In the recent years, much attention has been drawn to elements that affect lymphocyte survival. A cytokine called BAFF (or BLyS, TALL-1, THANK, zTNF4 or TNFSF13b), was identified in 1999 and was rapidly recognized as a potent survival factor for most B cells [1 /5].

2. Cloning, structure and expression of BAFF BAFF cDNA was identified in EST databases because of its homology with TNF family members. Subsequent structural studies confirmed that it adopts

the b-sheet-rich homotrimeric structure that earmarks members of this family [6 /8] (Fig. 1). Two magnesium atoms coordinated in the center of the trimer are believed to stabilize the protein, as previously reported for a zinc atom in the related ligand TRAIL [7,9]. BAFF is a type II transmembrane protein that is released in a soluble form by proteolytic processing [1,4]. Under certain conditions, twenty trimeric BAFF molecules can organize in a more complex structure through interactions via a surface-exposed loop which, at that particular position, is unique within the TNF family [6]. A close homologue of BAFF, called APRIL, shares some of the BAFF receptors, but not its potent B cell survival effect [10,11] (Fig. 2). BAFF and APRIL can form heteromers [12]. Two other ligands, TWEAK and EDA, have a structural and genomic organization similar to BAFF, thereby forming a 4 members subgroup of the TNF family [13]. The gene of BAFF is located on chromosome 13q34. BAFF mRNA is present mainly in lymphoid tissues. It is expressed by monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and by growth factor-stimulated neutrophils [4,14/16]. Low expression is observed in T cells, while BAFF is absent in B cells. Expression of BAFF is upregulated by IFNg and to a lesser extent by IL-10 in myeloid cells [16], and by G-CSF and to a lesser extent by IFNg in neutrophils [15]. Dendritic cells and

Curiously, the anti-sense gene product appears to interfere with translation of BCMA [25]. TACI is also a type III membrane protein, but in contrast to BCMA contains two cystein-rich domains [26]. Interestingly, both domains taken alone can interact with BAFF (PS and JT, unpublished data). TACI is expressed in B cells. One early report also describes its expression in a subset of activated T cells [26]. BAFF-R is a type I membrane protein that cannot be detected by TNFR-directed database profile searches. Although it is mainly expressed in B cells, its message is also present in T cells [18]. Studies at the mRNA or protein level indicate that different B cell subsets may differentially express the three different receptors for BAFF [24,27].

4. Function of BAFF and of its receptors One of the most spectacular functions of BAFF is undoubtedly to allow survival of transitional B cells during B cell maturation in the spleen. The bone marrow of BAFF(//(/ mice generates and releases immature B cells normally, but these B cells fail to proceed from the transitional type 1 (T1) to the transitional type 2 (T2) stage in the spleen [28,29]. As a result, BAFF(//(/ animals are virtually devoid of mature B cells and of marginal zone B cells, and are severely deficient in mounting humoral antibody responses. Interestingly, BAFF(//(/ retain B1 B cells

neutrophils appear to release soluble forms of BAFF more potently than monocytes and macrophages [15,16]. BAFF is one of the genes upregulated in response to the activation of the alternative NF-kB pathway [17].

3. Receptors interacting with BAFF Knowledge-based and expression screening approaches have led to the identification of three distinct receptors for BAFF, namely BCMA, TACI and BAFFR (also known as BR3), that are predominantly or exclusively expressed in B cells [2,18/20] (Fig. 2). All three belong to a relatively distant branch of the TNF receptor family, and all three bind to BAFF through relatively small domains [21]. In the case of BAFF-R, the binding domain can be reduced down to 26 aa [22]. Binding of BAFF to its receptors may adopt a different geometry than that of other TNF ligands to canonical TNF receptors. APRIL also binds to BCMA and TACI, but not to BAFF-R [18,19]. BCMA is a type III membrane protein (i.e. lacking a signal peptide) with a single cystein-rich domain expressed predominantly in mature and immunoglobulin secreting B cells [23]. Its message is however also present in transitional T1 B cells [24]. The BCMA gene is remarkable in that it is transcribed bi-directionally.

[28,29]. T2 B cells are exquisitely dependent on the prosurvival activity of BAFF in vitro, consistent with the idea that the lack of BAFF survival signals leads to their death in vivo [30]. Similarly, transgenic mice overexpressing a BAFF inhibitor (TACI-Ig) block B cell maturation between the T1 and T2 stages. However, because of incomplete inhibition, the phenotype is somehow attenuated [29,31]. Of the three receptors, BAFF-R specifically mediates the survival function of BAFF on transitional B cells because BAFF-R(//(/ have a maturation block similar to that of BAFF(//(/ [19,24]. Interestingly, mice with a mutation in the BAFF-R gene and expressing BAFF-R with a short truncation in the cytoplasmic domain have a similar, but less severe phenotype, indicating that this receptor retains partial signaling capacity [13]. These mature B cells are however short-lived, indicating that BAFF-R stimulation is important for the survival of mature as well as transitional B cells [24]. In contrast to BAFF-R, TACI mediates negative signal to B cells, as demonstrated by the development of autoimmunity and B cell hyperplasia in TACI(//(/ mice and by the inhibition of B cell proliferation in vitro with agonistic anti-TACI antibodies [32 /34]. But at the same time, TACI is required for mounting efficient humoral responses to T-independent antigens [33,34]. Intact bacteria are captured by immature blood dendritic cells and macrophages and presented to antigenspecific marginal zone B cells in the spleen to generate a rapid T-independent antibody response against repetitive epitopes of the pathogen [35,36]. Administration of TACI-Ig prevent dendritic cells from providing marginal zone B cells with a survival signal (probably BAFF), and thereby efficiently block this type of Tindependent response [36]. It is however unclear whether this signal is mediated through TACI, BAFF-R, or both. Similarly, stimulation of the B1 B cell humoral response by macrophages in the peritoneal cavity can be blocked by TACI-Ig, but is not known what pair of ligand and receptor is solicited in this case [36]. Tindependent responses produce low affinity IgM, but also IgG or IgA. BAFF and APRIL have been shown to stimulate class-switch in a CD40L-independent manner, in synergy with other switch factors such as IL-10 or TGF-b, and with antibody secretion stimuli such as IL15 or engagement of the BCR [37]. The activity of APRIL in this respect indicates that isotype switch does not require BAFF-R [37]. The contribution of BCMA to these processes is unclear. Immune functions that have been examined so far in BCMA(//(/ mice were unaffected [28,38]. BCMA may function in the regulation of plasma cell survival, consistent with its expression pattern [27]. Signals mediated by BAFF cooperate with those mediated by the BCR to upregulate expression of specific targets and favor proliferation [1,4,14,39]. In

addition to its action on B cells, BAFF also has a costimulatory effect on T cells, and BAFF inhibitors (TACI-Ig) can impair T cell activation [40,41].

5. Signaling through the different BAFF receptors As discussed above, BAFF-R is required for the survival of transitional B cells in the spleen. It is therefore of particular interest to identify the intracellular mediators of this response. Genetic studies have demonstrated the implication of the alternative NF-kB pathway in this process [22,42]. In the classical NF-kB pathway, the transcription factor NF-kB is usually activated following proteasome-mediated degradation of its inhibitor Ik-B following phosphorylation by the Ik-B kinase complex (IKK complex). Phosphorylation of Ik-B requires the IKKb kinase and the IKKg/NEMO regulatory element of the IKK complex. In the alternative pathway, the p100/NF-kB2 component of NF-kB is processed to a p52 subunit. This process requires specific activation of IKKa by NF-kB-inducing kinase (NIK), and phosphorylation of p100 by IKKa in an IKKg/NEMO-independent manner [43]. In bone marrow cell cultures, transitional B cells accumulate in the presence of BAFF. This process, which is accompanied by p100/NF-kB2 processing to p52, fails to occur in BAFF-R-deficient, in NIK-deficient or in NF-kB2deficient cells [42]. Signaling downstream of BAFF-R is certainly not restricted to this alternative NF-kB pathway, as NIK, IKKa and NF-kB2 deficiencies do not recapitulate the B cell phenotype of BAFF-R deficiency [44 /47]. In fact, NIK appears to be more specifically associated with LTbR-signaling [48]. The molecular link between BAFF-R and the alternative NF-kB pathway is unknown. A candidate mediator is TRAF-3, which interacts with the C-terminal portion of BAFF-R [49] (JT and PS, unpublished data). Of note, LTbR and CD40, the other two receptors known to activate NF-kB2, also bind to TRAF-3 [17,50]. In addition, a short C-terminal deletion mimicking the mutation found in BAFF-R mutant mice strongly impairs TRAF-3 binding (JT and PS, unpublished data). However, a functional role of TRAF-3 in this process remains to be demonstrated. The ultimate action of BAFF-R signaling is to prevent cell death. Several studies have suggested that this occurred by upregulation of anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2, A1 and Bcl-XL [24,51]. Moreover, in BAFF-depleted mice, enforced expression of Bcl-2 in B cells is sufficient to restore their survival, maturation and ability to produce humoral responses (PS and JT, unpublished data). Therefore, the prime role of BAFF is to protect B cells from apoptosis. In contrast to BAFF-R, both BCMA and TACI are strong activators of the classical NF-kB pathway. In

60

overexpression systems, BCMA interacts with TRAF1, 2 and 3 and activates TRAF-dependent NF-kB, JNK and p38 MAPK pathways [52]. TACI interacts with TRAF2, 5 and 6 and activate NF-kB, AP-1 and NF-AT transcription factors [26,53]. In addition, TACI interacts with CAML, a positive regulator of the calciumdependent phosphatase calcineurin [26]. The effect and significance of activation of these pathways downstream of TACI and BCMA in vivo is not known. However, activation of the intracellular domain of TACI can induce apoptosis in transfected cells, in agreement with an opposite role to that of BAFF-R [32].

lymphocytic leukemia cells (B-CLL) [62]. The survival rate of these cells in vitro was reduced in the presence of BCMA-Ig, suggesting that BAFF may indeed provide survival advantage to B-CLL via an autocrine mechanism [62].

7. Conclusions Genetic and biochemical studies on the BAFF system have provided a clear picture of a non-redundant survival signal for maturating, and, most probably, for fully differentiated B cells too. This provides a basis for the study of how B cells integrate signals provided by the BCR, co-stimulatory signals and BAFF itself, and how they respond to them. Exploration of BAFF regulation will help understand how B cells can survive in various environments under normal and pathologic conditions. It is obvious that the BAFF system is an important target for acting on the B cell arm of the immune system. Importantly, BAFF inhibitors could preserve some aspect of B cell function such as B cell production in the bone marrow, intestinal mucosal immunity and GC formation. This rather selective way of manipulating the immune system should provide an additional tool to deal with complex autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus and possibly some types of lymphomas.

6. BAFF and diseases A potential implication of BAFF in autoimmune diseases was first suggested by the phenotype of BAFF transgenic mice. In these mice, B lymphoplasia and hyperglobulinemia is often accompanied by production of autoantibodies, the development of glomerulonephritis and the destruction of salivary gland tissues [2,54/ 56]. This suggests a possible implication of elevated BAFF levels in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. The concentration of circulating  BAFF is indeed statistically higher in sera of patients with autoimmune conditions [55,57,58]. The generation of rheumatoid factors (antibodies directed against self IgG) results from activation of autoreactive B cells that are normally present in healthy individuals but typically remain quiescent. IgG2a-chromatin immune complexes can activate these B cells by delivering simultaneous signals through both the BCR (that binds the IgG2a) and Toll-like receptors (that interact with the nucleic acid particle) [59]. A B cell survival factor such as BAFF could only favor this detrimental process. CD4 ' T cells are probably required for BAFF-dependent autoantibody production. Indeed, higher levels of anti-phospholipid autoantibodies detected in HIV-patients correlate with higher levels of serum BAFF. However, as CD4' T cells get depleted, this correlation is lost [60]. This is in line with the hypothesis that BAFF reinforces existing processes of autoimmunity by promoting B cell survival. The targeting of BAFF with inhibitors, alone or in combination with treatments affecting the T-cell arm of the immune system, has proven efficient in the control of autoimmunity in mouse models of SLE and rheumatoid arthritis [2,29,40,61]. Hopefully, BAFF inhibitors will provide clinicians with a useful new tool to control these conditions, either alone or in conjugation with other immunomodulators. Because of its pro-survival activity, BAFF could potentially act as a transforming agent. In support of this hypothesis, aberrant expression of BAFF has been demonstrated in a significant proportion of B chronic
