ABSTRACT Cytochrome c is one of the most studied proteins probably due to its electron-transfer properties in aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Particularly, cytochrome c from bovine heart is a small protein, Mr 12,230 Da, globular (hydrodynamic diameter of 3.4 nm), soluble in different buffer solutions, and commercially available. Despite being a quite well-studied protein and relatively easy to manipulate from the biochemical and electrochemical viewpoint, its 3D structure has never been published. In this work, the purification, crystallization and 3D structure of one of the cytochrome c isoforms is pre° sented to 1.5 A resolution. It is also shown how the presence of isoforms made both the purification and crystallization steps difficult. Finally, a new approach for protein electrocrystallization and design of biosensors is presented.

INTRODUCTION In living organisms, many biological functions are governed by biomacromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides). Of these, particularly proteins behave as macroions in solution and therefore are sensitive to electric fields. Even membrane proteins, which are highly hydrophobic, present preferential orientations and exhibit well defined electrochemical behavior. However, many years were needed to join the study of electrochemistry to biology. Two key experiments led to the assimilation of the two fields. In the first experiment, Kallman and Pope1 found that certain substances considered insulators did accept electrons and permit the current to pass through them when they were exposed to redox systems in solution. The second experiment, conducted by Rosenberg and Postow,2 showed that the conductivity data that had been published for proteins were not correct. This was because all measurements were performed using dried material and not in solutions. In many biological systems water is part of their structure, so proteins can be considered as semiconductors and not insulators as formerly believed. Cytochrome c is one of the most studied proteins in electrochemistry due to its electron-transfer properties involved in aerobic as well as in anaerobic respiration. Even though it is commercially available, the three-dimensional structure of bovine cytochrome c has never been published. On the other hand, it has been reported that the presence of isoforms of cytochrome c3,4 is generated by non-enzymatic deaminidation.5,6 To date, four isoforms have been reported, which are products of spontaneous deaminidation during the purification steps.6 Cytochrome c can lose one, two, or three amide groups from its exposed Gln or Asn with the resulting change in its isoelectric point.4­6 Particularly, the native isoform (which is called Cy I) is the most basic having a pI of 10.78.4 This mixture of charges in solution thwarts the crystallization step, as it will be explained later in this article. The purpose of this work was to present the purification, crystallization, and three° dimensional structure resolution at 1.5 A of the native cytochrome c isoform. It is shown how the presence of a mixture of isoforms made both the purification and crystallization steps difficult. Finally, a new approach is presented for protein electrodeposition and design of electron transfer biosensors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein purification

Cytochrome c (from Sigma C-3131) from bovine heart mitochondria was repurified by HPLC technique using a reverse phase chromatography column (C18 Jupiter 300 A, 5 lm, Phenomenex) in an HP 1100 chromatographer in order to separate the isoforms. The column was equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The elution was performed applying a linear gradient with 100% acetonitrile and 0.12% (v/v) TFA at a flow rate of 1ml/minute. A solution of 500 lg of cytochrome c was oxidized with K3Fe(CN)6 before injection. The elution profile was followed at three different wavelengths: 215 nm (for peptide bonds) and 360 and 410 nm (for oxidized haemo group).6 The two isoforms were concentrated separately with YM-10 centrifugal concentrators (MWCO 10kDa, Millipore). The purification of commercial bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome c, as performed according to a previously published protocol (Brautigan et al.6) did not separate the isoforms. Therefore, we purified cytochrome c using reverse phase chromatography in order to separate the isoforms.
Dynamic light scattering

contained 30% PEG 1000 in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0.The droplets consisted of 2 lL protein (25 mg/ mL in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) and 2 lL precipitant (25% PEG 1000, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). These were equilibrated against a 1000 lL reservoir solution consisting of 30% PEG 1000 in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 48C. These conditions produced poorly shaped aggregates after 32 days. These aggregates were used as microseeds and were transferred (by means of a cat whisker) to pre-equilibrated droplets containing 22 mg/mL of protein and 25% PEG 1000 both prepared in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After 1 week, several crystals were obtained reaching maximum dimensions of 0.25 3 0.1 3 0.1 mm.
Protein crystallization in the presence of an electric field

The analysis of the hydrodynamic radius, diffusion coefficient, and molecular weight determination by TILS (total intensity light scattering) were obtained from the software DYNAMICS (Protein Solutions Co.), which was run on the protein directly from the Sigma bottle. For these studies, solutions of cytochrome c were prepared in distilled water, sodium phosphate pH 7.0 or sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, and were analyzed at 48C and 188C. A Dyna Pro 801 TC apparatus with a diode laser of 760 nm was used (Protein Solutions Co.).
Mass Spectroscopy

Crystals of cytochrome c were also obtained by using a variation of the gel acupuncture method, in which Pt electrodes were introduced in the crystallization cell.8 The precipitating agent was 40% PEG 1000 in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The capillary tube was filled with 31 mg/mL pure native cytochrome c, and the crystallization was achieved by applying a constant current of 0.8 lA over the course of 15 days. The crystals obtained with this method reached a size of 0.1 3 0.05 3 0.1 mm3 after 15 days.
X-ray diffraction and high resolution 3D structure of cytochrome c

° X-ray data to 1.5 A resolution were collected on the X6A beam line at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY. A full data set of 180 oscillation images was collected with an ADSC Quantum Detector 210. The data were integrated and scaled with the HKL 2000 package.9 The data statistics are given in Table I.
Structure determination and refinement

Collected cytochrome c isoforms from HPLC were analyzed employing an Omniflex MALDI TOF (Brucker Daltonics) with a N2 laser at 337.1 nm and a linear acceleration of 19 kV in a linear way. Two references were used to calculate the Mr: ubiquitin (Mr 8564.9 Da) and lysozyme (Mr 14,300). These proteins were mixed with sinapinic acid in 30% acetonitrile, 70% water, and 0.1% (v/v) TFA. The samples were prepared in a ratio 1:5 protein:matrix and air-dried.
Protein crystallization

The structure of isoform Cy I (native cytochrome c) was determined by molecular replacement using programs from the suite CNS 1.1v10 and horse cytochrome c (PDB 1CRC) as the search model. The search model crystallized in the same space group and diffracted to ° 2.08 A. The electron density maps were created and refined using the CNS suite 1.1v10 and visualized by TURBO-FRODO.11
Atomic force microscopy

The crystallization was prepared by using the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method in NEXTAL plates (Code NCP-24-100). Crystallization conditions similar to the ones published for the oxidized forms of native horse, and rat cytochrome c7 were set up. The reservoir (1000 lL)

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The hydrodynamic properties of biomacromolecular solutions should be taken into account in order to obtain high quality crystals. Some of these properties are the hydrodynamic radius, diffusion coefficient, molecular weight and the second virial coefficient. In the particular case of the described sample (commercial bovine cytochrome c without any further purification), when an aqueous solution of cytochrome c was analyzed by dynamic light scattering, anomalous values of hydrodynamic radius were shown, while in sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 or sodium phosphate pH 7.0 this protein showed an optimal monodispersity. The hydrodynamic radius was 1.76 and 1.86 nm corresponding to a molecular weight of 12.6 and 14.4 kDa when phosphate and cacodylate buffers were used respectively. This result is in accordance with previous reports where phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 was the most common stabilizer as well as the most appropriate medium to dissolve cytochrome c.6 After obtaining the appropriate data of solubility and purity (based on the homogeneity of the sample determined by light scattering methods) and using standard cytochrome c from the Sigma bottle, a crystallization screening was performed using Crystal Screen I (Hampton Research). Only small red aggregates and spherulites were obtained with 18% PEG 8000 plus 0.2M zinc acetate in 0.1M cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5. However, single crystals were never obtained; this fact has been previously reported by many researchers. Although the cytochrome c showed a monodisperse profile, the existence of deaminidated isoforms hampered the crystallization. Cytochrome c requires extra purification steps due to the existence of deaminidated isoforms.4­7,13,14 In order to separate the isoforms of cytochrome c, the procedure outline by Brautigan et al.6 was performed; however adequate results could not be reproduced. Instead of this, a better result was obtained using HPLC with a C18 reverse phase column. Two fractions were detected and characterized for their high purity by mass spectroscopy (Fig. 1). Fraction one (F1) was composed primarily by a molecule with a mass of 12,230.436 Da while the second fraction (F2) was composed of a molecule of 12,232.756 Da. The first fraction corresponded to the native protein and the second to a deaminidated form according to Flatmark's reports.3­5,14 The other isoforms were not observed (Cy III and Cy IV). The deaminidated isoforms are formed during the purification from bovine heart mitochondria, and this procedure was performed by Sigma. Additionally, the amount of each isoform can vary depending on the purification protocol, with the native form generally existing in greatest abundance.4 Once the isoforms were separated, both fractions were ready to be crystallized by using the crystallization conditions, which initially were used for horse cytochrome c.13 More than a month and microseeding

module (EC-AFM). An electrochemical fluid cell (50 lL) with silicon nitrate tips (NP-20, SPM from Digital Instruments Co.) was used for this purpose. The cyclic voltammetry characterization was performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat module of the EC-AFM; a triangular-shaped wave potential was employed. In this configuration, a silver wire was used as a reference electrode; a platinum wire was used as a counter-electrode and an ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) surface as a working electrode. The electrochemical potential was cycled between À500 and 500 mV at 100 mV sÀ1 in all cases, starting with a reduction cycle. The solution under electrochemical control was monitored with a CCD optical video camera coupled to the AFM. The program AxioVision from Zeiss Co. was used to record the digital images. The AFM images were analyzed with Nanoscope IIIa software version 5.22.r4.
Sample preparation for EC-AFM investigations

In order to improve the electrochemical signal by removing the dissolved oxygen from the solutions, we used a flux of N2 10 to 15 min before performing the electrochemical experiments. 1 cm2 of ITO electrodes (CD-50 IN-S105 R: 8­12 O, Delta Technologies) were placed over metallic holders and a high purity colloidal metallic silver conductive paint was applied to ensure the conductivity.12 Then 50 lL of either buffer control or protein (ranging from 5.2 to 50 mM) were deposited and incubated at 48C for 1 h. After this time the electrode was cleaned with distilled water and scanned in the fluid cell of the atomic force microscope for adsorbed aggregates.

tion of the diffraction data showed the His 18 and Met 80 interacting axially with the haemo group [Fig. 3(d)]. The purification of cytochrome c was critical in the successful crystallization; only one of the isoforms was suitable to be crystallized. This was probably due to the nature of the crystal contacts. Spontaneous deaminidations during purification can happen to surface-exposed glutamines and asparagines.5,14 Based on the high-resolution data of our model we could localize the three exposed glutamines, which have high susceptibility for deaminidation: Gln 12, Gln 16 and Gln 42.5,14 Figure 4 shows four symmetry-related cytochrome c molecules with the glutamines involved in crystal contacts highlighted. Figure 5(a) shows a close up of them and their neighboring amino acids. In the native ° ° isoform, Gln 16 is 4.9 A from Glu 61, Gln 12 is 5.5 A of ° Lys 39, and Gln 42 is 3.49 A from Lys 73 [Fig. 5(b)]. These distances can vary upon deaminidation. Stronger interactions can be set between deaminidated Gln 16, 12 and 42 (now glutamic acid) and these Lys 39, Lys 73, or Glu 62. As a consequence, electrostatic attractions or repulsions can negatively affect the distances between amino acids and prevent formation of crystal contacts between the monomers. To gain a deeper understanding of the possible effect of deaminidation of these three glutamines (Gln 12, 16, and 42) on the crystal packing, we overlaid the bovine native cytochrome c structure (PDB code 2B4Z) with the horse native cytochrome c structure (PDB code 1CRC). In addition, the distance of the exposed Gln 12 (Q12), Gln 16 (Q16) and Gln 42 (Q42) to their neighboring residues in the P212121 symmetry group were analyzed. A close up of these regions, as well as the distance values

manipulations of the drops were needed to obtain several red rectangular well-shaped crystals, as those shown in Figure 2. They appeared in drops of fraction F1, but none were obtained on drops prepared with the second ° fraction (F2). The crystals diffracted up to 1.4­1.5 A resolution in the synchrotron radiation facility at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Beamline X6A, BNL, USA). All data and statistics obtained after processing the X-ray diffraction are shown in Table I. These data yielded a unique data set of 17,207 reflections with an Rmerge of 4.3%. The crystals belonged to the P212121 space group with four monomers/asymmetric unit and a 46% solvent content. All coordinates were deposited in the protein databank with PDB code 2B4Z.

are shown in Figure 6. The Gln 42 (Q42) in the horse ° isoforms is at 3.94 A from Lys 73 (K73) in the neighboring horse cytochrome c molecule [Fig. 6(a)]. Gln 12 ° (Q12) is at approximately 6A distance from Lys 39 (K39) in the horse and bovine crystals [Fig. 6(b)]. A similar distance is observed for this pair in the bovine crystal structure. However, Gln 16 (Q16) is at twice the distance from Glu 62 (E62) in the horse isoforms crystal compared with the bovine one. In the bovine heart cyto° chrome c crystal arrangement, Gln 16 (Q16) is at 4.93 A ° in the horse cytofrom Glu 62 (E62) while it is 8.52 A ° chrome c crystal. Even though 4.93 A is far enough to accommodate this pair (Gln­Glu), the deaminidation effect in bovine heart cytochrome c would therefore have greater consequences for its crystallization than for the corresponding horse variant.

Crystallization of cytochrome c in the presence of an electric field

After obtaining the crystallization conditions of native cytochrome c, the pure isoform was used as a model for electrocrystallization (due to its inherent electron-transfer properties). The crystallization was done by means of using a variation of the experimental set-up of the gel acupuncture method,15 in which one electrode was introduced inside of a capillary tube and another inside the gel.8 The set-up was designed to reduce the induction time to less than a month, through usage of a direct current applied along the crystallization process.

applied to the use of these crystals as biosensors since they maintain their electron transfer function. The electrochemical behavior of cytochrome c on different metallic electrodes, like gold,17 platinum,17 and nickel18 has been reported as a non-reversible phenomenon. The only quasi-reversible and quantified behavior has been reported on ITO (indium tin oxide) electrodes.19 The purity of protein samples is always the limiting factor to achieve successful and reproducible electrochemical responses. Even trace levels of contaminants in proteins (other proteins or isoforms) can change the electron transfer rate.20­22 Pure cytochrome c could allow future electrochemical studies of cytochrome c

experimental set-up included two collinear Pt wire electrodes. One of them was introduced in the gel and the other one was placed inside the capillary tube. The electrode introduced inside the capillary tube was 0.25 mm in diameter and functioned as an anode. It was in contact with the purified cytochrome c solution (F1) at a concentration of 31 mg/mL prepared in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The precipitating agent was 40% PEG 1000 in the same buffer. The cathode was a Pt wire of 1 mm in diameter, which was introduced in the silica hydrogel prepared as described by Moreno et al.16 and Mirkin et al.8 After 15 days of exposing the cell to a direct current of 0.8 lA, red crystals of cytochrome c were obtained around the Pt anode. Even though precipitation of cytochrome c on the surface of the electrode was not observed, crystals were present nearby at the anode. The advantages of using this method were the simple manipulation of the samples and the reduction in the induction time for the nucleation. Compared with the classic hanging-drop and microseeding methods which required 45 days for obtaining crystals, applying an internal electric field allowed the crystals to be obtained in just 2 weeks. The crystals obtained with this new technique were not as large as those obtained in the control (by using the classic vapor diffusion method and microseeding). However, this new electrocrystallization approach is a promising tool for investigating the electrocrystallization process of proteins with electron-transfer activity or for attaching metallo-protein crystals on the surface of electrodes. The method used to obtain cytochrome c crystals in the presence of a soft and direct current could potentially be

aggregates to evaluate its role in an electron transfer biosensor. From the electrochemical view point, cytochrome c is a promising biosensor23 molecule candidate because it contains a haemo group, which facilitates electron transfer.24 This protein presents an asymmetric charge distribution that favors its redox activity. The haemo group is located in a lateral region of the protein molecule in an area rich with lysine (basic residue) known as a front face. The front face electrostatically guides the cytochrome c towards the electrode or interacting with other negatively charged proteins. The cytochrome c molecule is absorbed on ITO electrodes without denaturating. In 1969, Rosenberg and Postow discovered that hydration increases the electric conductivity of proteins.2 Proteins contain a high amount of water, so it is valid to assume that they are excellent electric conductors. Although the electron transfer mechanism is complicated to inter° pret,25 when the distance is around or below 20 A, the

mechanisms of electron transfer could be similar to that of tunneling.26 However, at larger distances this mechanism can induce movements in the protein molecule or any conformational change-associated.27 Hilgen-Willis et al. measured the free energy of denaturation of the reduced form of cytochrome c upon its absorption on ITO electrodes. It was found that the addition of an electron to the cytochrome c conferred structural stability to the protein.20 Thus, depending on the magnitude of those conformational changes they can have a negative influence on the formation of crystal contacts.

appropriate concentration of cytochrome c to deposit on the surface of the ITO electrode, 50 lL of cytochrome c solutions ranging from 5.2 to 40 lM were incubated for 1 h at 48C. Then the surface of the electrode was scanned with an atomic force microscope (AFM) to search for adsorbed molecules and their electrochemical activity was checked. As control, a solution of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 was used since it had been shown not to interact with the electrode. The scanned images were analyzed using the Roughness software of the atomic force microscope; different types of aggregates were detected as it is shown in Figure 7. Table II shows the percentages of size distribution found on the surface of ITO in the presence of different concentrations of cytochrome c. These data correlate properly to the analysis done by dynamic light scattering. We detected protein monomers in phosphate buffer of 3.4 nm in diameter (as described above in this article). In the atomic force microscopy experiment, where roughness analysis was used, monomers were not detected. Instead, surface aggregates with 103 greater diameters were found on the surface when incu-

bated with the low concentration of cytochrome c (5.2 lM). This suggests that cytochrome c forms decamers when interacting with the electrode. Upon increasing protein concentration the surface was strongly covered by these aggregates increasing the percentage of decamers. The aggregates of 78.125 nm can be interpreted as two decamers, while those of 117.19 nm are in the range of three decamers. When ITO electrode was incubated with a 20 lM solution an increase in the number of particles

with 39.06 nm diameter was observed but the percentage of aggregates with diameter of 117.19 nm decreased. Decamer units can be localized in the interstices that flatten the surface of the electrode. This tendency increases with higher concentrations of cytochrome c. Keeping in mind the aim to produce electro-active aggregates, the electrochemical response of these modified electrodes was evaluated. Cyclic voltammetry analysis was performed in order to check the electrochemical behavior of the cytochrome c layer, as detailed in Materials and Methods. A voltammogram shows the stability of a compound when the reduced and oxidized peak signals are obtained. Despite the presence of the aggregates on ITO treated with 5.2 lM cytochrome c, no electrochemical activity was detected. However when ITO incubated with 20 lM of cytochrome c was evaluated, a different response was observed. A typical quasi reversible cytochrome c voltammogram, like that shown in Figure 8 was obtained. The electrochemical signal was evaluated during 2000 s suggesting certain stability. No response was observed in the 40-lM-treated electrodes. These data provide strong evidence that the deposition of the aggregates on the electrodes is necessary to obtain a good electrochemical response. ITO incubated with 20-lM cytochrome c resembles the surface of bare ITO and provided a stable quasi-reversible response. In particular, cytochrome c covered surfaces with reduced height dispersion of their adsorbate are more favorable to the electron transfer process. This can probably be attributed to certain optimal orientations between cytochrome c aggregates that maximize the electron transfer between the protein in solution and the ITO surface. On the other hand, 5.2 and 40 lM treated electrodes, which exposed a
DOI 10.1002/prot

more irregular surface showed no electrochemical signal. From these results, it is plausible that microcrystals of cytochrome c could be used as an electron transfer biosensor, whenever they are pure and only one isoform is present. All the experiments were performed in a fluid cell of the atomic force microscope coupled to an electrochemical potentiostat/galvanostat (EC-AFM), so the electron transference occurs in a hydrated medium. The promising possibility of using cytochrome c as an electron transfer biosensor must be based on structural data. Due to the asymmetric disposition of charges in this molecule, electron transfer is possible via a tunneling mechanism.26 Cytochrome c disposition in a three-dimensional crystal lattice can be achieved by minimizing repulsions between charged groups. Moreover, from the AFM studies it can be concluded that the electron transference between molecules in the crystal lattice is possible due to an even disposition of the aggregates. Further studies upon crystal growth of cytochrome c attached to ITO electrodes will bring precise knowledge on this matter.

CONCLUSION In this study the importance of separating isoforms of cytochrome c for the crystallization process of the molecule is shown. After obtaining only one of the ultra-pure forms of cytochrome c, crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop method combined to microseeding technique. The high-resolution detail of the structure reveals the position of the haemo group and its interaction with specific amino acids. The possibility of using cytochrome c as an electron transfer biosensor must be taken into account based on the electrochemical results presented in
