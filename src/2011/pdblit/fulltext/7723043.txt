Conformation of a Non-frameshifting RNA Pseudoknot from Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus
Hunseung Kang, Jennifer V. Hines and Ignacio Tinoco Jr*
Department of Chemistry University of California and Structural Biology Division Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley CA 94720, USA The solution conformation of an RNA pseudoknot, which is a mutant of the pseudoknot required for ribosomal frameshifting in mouse mammary tumor virus, has been determined by NMR. The 32-nucleotide RNA pseudoknot does not promote efficient frameshifting, although its sequence is very similar to the efficient frameshifting pseudoknot whose structure was recently determined by our group. 13C-labeling of the RNA and 13 C-edited NMR techniques were used to facilitate spectral assignment. The three-dimensional structure of the RNA pseudoknot was determined by restrained molecular dynamics based on NMR-derived interproton distances and torsion angle constraints. The conformation is very different from that previously determined for the efficient-frameshifting pseudoknot. Two unpaired nucleotides are stacked between stem 1 and stem 2, in contrast to the one unpaired nucleotide at the same junction region as found previously. The two stems of the pseudoknot are not coaxial, they are twisted and bent relative to each other. Loop 2 does not cross the shallow minor groove of stem 1, in contrast to the pseudoknots with one or no intervening nucleotides between the stems. The fact that a specific conformation is required for efficient frameshifting implies a specific interaction of the pseudoknot with the ribosome.

Introduction
Many viruses use non-standard methods of decoding their viral RNA to synthesize different protein products from a single polycistronic messenger RNA. These involve ribosomal frameshifting, stop-codon read-through, and ribosomal hopping. In particular, ribosomal frameshifting is used in many retroviruses (Jacks et al., 1987; Atkins et al., 1990; Jacks, 1990; Hatfield et al., 1992; ten Dam et al., 1994), coronaviruses (Brierley et al., 1989; den Boon et al., 1991; Herold & Siddell, 1993),

toroviruses (Snijder et al., 1990), the yeast retrotransposon Ty (Clare & Farabaugh, 1985; Mellor et al., 1985), the yeast LA double-stranded viruses (Dinman et al., 1991; Tzeng et al., 1992), and several prokaryotes (Craigen & Caskey, 1987; Flower & Mchenry, 1990; Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990). In retroviruses, three essential enzymes, integrase, protease and reverse transcriptase, are encoded from the pol and pro genes. The expression of these gene products is regulated at the level of translation, by ribosomal frameshifting into the minus-one frame (Atkins et al., 1990; Hatfield et al., 1992). Mutational studies indicate that at least two cis-acting signals, a heptanucleotide sequence of repeated bases and a specific RNA structure downstream of this shift site, are required for efficient frameshifting (Jack et al., 1988; Brierley et al., 1989, 1991; ten Dam et al., 1990). Involvement of RNA pseudoknots in ribosomal frameshifting has been investigated extensively (Jack et al., 1988; Chamorro et al., 1992; Morikawa & Bishop, 1992; Tu et al., 1992; Somogyi et al., 1993). The important question, how do pseudoknots induce frameshifting, has not been answered. One proposal is that an RNA pseudoknot promotes

136 frameshifting by acting as a passive barrier to the processing ribosome, which makes the ribosome stop or stall at the shift site and thus increases slippage into the minus-one frame (Jack et al., 1988; Tu et al., 1992; Somogyi et al., 1993). Chen et al. (1995), however, showed that, in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a frameshifting pseudoknot could not be replaced by a hairpin with greater thermal stability, or by a tRNA with its complex tertiary interactions. This suggests that the RNA pseudoknot is not just a passive barrier to the approaching ribosome, but that specific features of the pseudoknot are required for efficient frameshifting. What are these structural features? Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the RNA pseudoknot downstream of the shift site is a prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting. The three-dimensional structure of the RNA pseudoknot that promotes efficient ribosomal frameshifting in MMTV was recently reported (Shen & Tinoco, 1995). The pseudoknot (designated VPK) is bent with an angle of about 112° between the stems. The two stems of the pseudoknot are separated by an intervening adenylate residue that acts as a hinge

Non-frameshifting RNA Pseudoknot

between the stems. The bend is caused by the sterically constrained loops at the junction of the two stems. The bent conformation of the pseudoknot may be the structural determinant recognized by the translational machinery. However, three-dimensional structures of other RNA pseudoknots that show different frameshifting efficiencies must be determined before this hypothesis can be tested. Here we report the NMR structure of an RNA pseudoknot that is very similar in sequence to the frameshifting pseudoknot studied by Shen & Tinoco (1995), but does not promote efficient frameshifting in MMTV (Chen et al., 1995). Figure 1 compares the sequences and frameshifting efficiencies of the frameshifting pseudoknot, VPK, the non-frameshifting pseudoknot studied here, APK, and the mutant APK + CCC. The last seven nucleotides in VPK (G28 GCCCAU) were replaced by (G28 CCCG) in APK. In the expected secondary structure (Figure 1) stem 2 is left unchanged with six base-pairs, but with the G·U and A·U pairs at the ends of its stem interchanged. Loop 2 in APK is shorter by one nucleotide. However, we find that this small change in sequence produces a very different conformation. Although both VPK and APK do form pseudoknots

in the context of the MMTV mRNA (Chen et al., 1995), the frameshifting efficiencies of VPK and APK in vitro are 12% and 2%, respectively. Correlation of the different frameshifting efficiencies with the different conformations provides new information about possible structural determinants of the RNA pseudoknots for promoting efficient ribosomal frameshifting.

Results
Assignment of the exchangeable proton resonances The exchangeable proton spectrum of the pseudoknot APK at 15°C is shown in Figure 2. Nine sharp imino resonances (the first and fourth peaks are each two overlapping resonances) in the chemical shift region of 13.5 to 12 ppm are observed from the imino protons in the G·C base-pairs of the helical regions of the pseudoknot. Two upfield broad peaks in the range of 10.5 to 11.5 ppm correspond to imino protons in the single-stranded loops and imino protons from G·U base-pairs. Imino assignments were from 2D-NOESY spectra in H2 O. Sequence-specific assignments of the imino resonances were made by comparing the intrastrand G imino proton to H1' NOE connectivities and the cross-strand G imino to H1' connectivities, as well as the G imino­C amino­C5 proton connectivities, as discussed by Heus & Pardi (1991). The relative positions of assigned imino peaks for the pseudoknot APK are similar to those observed for VPK, which has the same base-pairing in stem 1 and similar base-pairing in stem 2 (Shen & Tinoco, 1995). No U imino from A·U base-pairs, normally

resonating in the 13.5 to 14.5 ppm region, was observed in the spectrum. The imino spectra of APK are not consistent with the expected secondary structure shown in Figure 1; the U8·G32 and U13·A27 base-pairs do not form in stem 2. The upfield broad peaks in the range of 10.5 to 11.5 ppm could be imino resonances from the single-stranded loop nucleotides and a U8·G32 base-pair at the bottom of stem 2. We ruled out U8·G32 base-pairing from the following observations. First, imino resonances from G9 and G28 broadened and disappeared first with increasing temperature, indicating that G9·C31 and C12·G28 are the terminal base-pairs in stem 2. Second, chemical probing of the APK with a nickel complex, specific for the N7 position of solvent-accessible G residues (Chen et al., 1993), showed very strong reactivity toward the G9 residue, thus indicating little or no stacking between U8 and G9. Third, no NOE connectivities were observed between U8 and G9. From these NMR data and the chemical probing result, we concluded that a U8·G32 base-pair does not form in stem 2; stem 2 of pseudoknot APK consists of four G·C base-pairs. We note that the imino resonance from G1 is sharp and upfield shifted. This has been found in other pseudoknots (Puglisi et al., 1990; Shen & Tinoco, 1995); it is caused by the stacking of residue A20 upon the G1·C19 base-pair. Assignment of the non-exchangeable proton resonances In the stems, base protons and ribose H1' protons were assigned from DQF­COSY, natural abundance 1 H­13C HMQC spectra, and standard aromatic­ anomeric proton sequential NOE connectivities.

to assign H3' (and some of the H4') resonances of the loop nucleotides with observable H1'­H2' scalar couplings, as well as to confirm previously assigned H2' resonances. In order to increase the number of assignments and to confirm our assignments based on the NOESY spectra, 1/2 X-filtered NOESY experiments were used for the selectively 13C-labeled RNA oligonucleotides. We selectively labeled the RNA sample with 13C at C8 of adenine and C6 of uracil. As shown in Figure 4, a NOESY spectrum is thus divided into 12C and 13C sub-spectra, and is greatly simplified compared with a normal NOESY spectrum (Figure 3). The 13C sub-spectrum (Figure 4(b)) of the pseudoknot specifically labeled at adenine C8 and uracil C6 contains NOEs from the 13 C-bound AH8 and UH6 protons to other protons. In contrast, a 12C sub-spectrum (Figure 4(a)) of the same pseudoknot contains NOEs from the 12 C-bound GH8, CH6, and AH2 protons to other protons. By comparing these sub-spectra with a normal NOESY spectrum, every A and U residue located in the loops and junction regions could be identified, and their aromatic and sugar resonances assigned unambiguously. All H1', H2' and aromatic protons (except A27H2) were assigned. Most H3' sugar protons were assigned. The spectral assignments of the pseudoknot APK in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 at 25°C are summarized in Table 1.

H8/ H6(i + 1) to H1'(i ) connectivities are shown for the nucleotides in stem to loop and stem to stem junction regions. NOEs between AH2(i ) and H1'(i + 1) are indicated by their residue number.

Structural implications Stacking interactions between neighboring nucleotides are one of the most important stabilizing factors for oligonucleotides, and are indicated by NOEs between protons measured at short mixing times. Figure 5 summarizes the NMR evidence for internucleotide base stacking of the pseudoknot APK. Thick lines represent more than three observed NOEs, medium lines two or three NOEs, and thin lines no NOE between neighboring nucleotides. Residues G1 to C5 and G15 to C19 in stem 1, and G28 to C31 and G9 to C12 in stem 2 showed strong H8/H6(i )­H2'(i - 1) and medium H8/H6(i )­ H3'(i - 1) NOEs, characteristic of stacking interactions in A-form helices. Strong stacking was present in the C5­A6­G7 steps. Observation of NOEs from A6H2 to G7H1' and to cross-strand G15H1' also indicates that the C5­A6­G7 steps are stacked. In the aromatic­aromatic region of short mixing time (60 and 150 ms) NOESYs, a cross-peak from A6H2 to A14H2 with medium intensity was observed, also indicating continuous stacking of A6 to C5. These NOEs indicate that A6 must be close in space to the A14 in the other strand. However, the weak NOE between A6H2 and G15H1' indicates that stacking between C5 and A6 is not canonical A-form. Many NOEs were observed between aromatic and sugar protons for the nucleotides at the junction region of stem 1 and stem 2, indicating continuous

resonances were assigned from the strongest NOEs to the H1' protons at a short mixing time (60 ms). H3' resonances in stems were assigned using NOE connectivities H8/H6(i )­H3'(i )­H1'(i ), and further verified by using H8/H6(i + 1)-H3'(i ) connectivities. However, severe spectral overlap of the H3', H4', and H5'/H5" resonances limited the number of assignments obtainable for the 32-mer pseudoknot. In the loops, unambiguous assignments were made using NOESY, DQF-COSY, and TOCSY spectra. First, aromatic/anomeric NOE connectivities were used to assign aromatic and H1' resonances. Although this approach may be subject to misassignments for unusual conformations, A-form like connectivities were observed in the aromatic to H1' region of NOESY for the loop nucleotides of pseudoknot APK (Figure 3). H2' resonances were assigned from the strongest NOEs to the H1' protons at short mixing times (60 ms) just as for the stems. Assignments of the H1' and H2' of the loop nucleotides with observable H1'­H2' scalar couplings were further verified by a DQF­COSY experiment. Finally, a TOCSY experiment was used

Figure 4. A 150 ms 1/2 X filtered NOESY spectrum of specifically 13C-labeled APK in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 at 25°C. The pseudoknot was labeled at adenine C8 and uracil C6. The 12C sub-spectrum (a) and 13C sub-spectrum (b) are simplified compared to a normal NOESY spectrum. The intraresidue H8/H6 to H1' cross-peaks and the H5 to H6 cross-peaks of pyrimidines are indicated by residue number. In this pseudoknot, the C23 to A24 step in loop 2 was changed to C23 to G24 in order to reduce cleavage of the RNA. A new cross-peak from G24 is indicated in the 12C sub-spectrum.

stacking of residues C12 through G15. The aromatic­aromatic (H8/H6­H8/H6 and H5­H5) NOEs observed between neighboring residues C12 to G15 at 150 ms mixing times also indicate that these bases are continuously stacked. However, medium intensity NOEs between H8/H6(i ) and H2'(i - 1) and weak NOEs between H8/H6(i ) and H1'(i - 1) in the junction nucleotides show that residues U13 and A14 are not stacked as expected in A-form helices; there seems to be a little perturbation of the structure along the strand at the junction of stem 1 and stem 2. A20, the first nucleotide in loop 2, has a strong NOE from H8 to C19H2' and a medium NOE from H2 to G1H1', as well as three other NOEs between A20 aromatic and C19 sugar and aromatic protons. This indicates that A20 is stacked on top of C19. This strong stacking is also indicated by the sharp and up-field-shifted imino resonance of G1 residue (Figure 2). Many NOEs were observed from H5/H6 of C21 to sugar protons of A20, from A20H8 to H5/H6 of C21, and from A20H2 to sugar protons of C21.

All these NOEs indicate that residues G9 to C21 of the pseudoknot APK are continuously stacked, although some distortions from a standard A-form stacking interaction are present, especially at the junction region of stem 1 and stem 2. NOE connectivities of the loop nucleotides deviate from those observed for A-form geometry. As discussed above, residues A6 and G7 in loop 1 are stacked on C5. H6/H5 of U8 in loop 1 has medium and weak NOEs to H1'/H2' protons of G7. A weak NOE from U8H6 to G7H8 was also observed. There was a break of the NOE walk at the junction of loop 1 and stem 2; no NOE was observed between U8 and G9. For the nucleotides in loop 2 many NOEs from aromatic to sugar protons between neighboring nucleotides were observed for the residues U22 through A27. Although the intensities of NOEs deviate from A-form-like stacking, these observations indicate that residues in loop 2 are more or less stacked on each other. Scalar coupling (j coupling) information was used to characterize the sugar conformations as C-3'-endo or C-2'-endo puckers. Nucleotides in both loops have

140 detectable H1'­H2' couplings, with 4­5 Hz couplings for U8 in loop 1 and for U22 to A27 in loop 2. G28 and G32 also have 4-5 Hz H1'­H2' couplings. For C-3'-endo sugars a small (<1 Hz) H1'­H2' coupling is observed, whereas for C-2'-endo sugars a large (08 Hz) H1'­H2' coupling is observed (Altona, 1982). The intermediate H1'­H2' coupling constants observed for the nucleotides in both loops and the 3' terminal nucleotide indicate that these residues are in equilibrium between C-2'-endo and C-3'-endo sugar conformations. Absence of detectable H1'-H2' couplings for the nucleotides both in stems and in loops (e.g. A6, G7, A20, and C21) indicates that these residues adopt C-3'-endo sugar pucker, as expected for the nucleotides in A-form helices. Structure determination Ten starting structures for the 32-nucleotide pseudoknot APK were generated by randomizing backbone torsion angles, a, b, g, e, and z, as described in Materials and Methods. Torsion angles d and x were set to C-3'-endo and anti, respectively, for the starting structures. In addition to the empirical energy terms for bond lengths and bond

angles, inter-proton distances and torsion angle constraints deduced from the measured intensities of NOE cross-peaks and H1'­H2' coupling constants, respectively, were used to calculate three-dimensional conformations of the RNA pseudoknot. Four additional distance constraints were used to maintain hydrogen bonding for each of the nine G·C base-pairs in the stems. Therefore, the input data included 218 NOE-based distance restraints, 36 hydrogen-bond distances, 14 base-pair planarity restraints, and 189 torsion angle dihedral restraints. The dihedral restraints were three kinds: 128 sugar pucker angles, 29 angles to keep amino groups in the plane of the bases, and 32 x angles to keep the bases anti. After global folding of the starting structures using a simulated annealing protocol, structures with lower total energy and NOE violations were selected for further refinement. Four

141 ° RMSD for the four structures is 2.0 A. Although the number of NOE constraints (56 NOEs for A20­A27 residues) used for the loop 2 nucleotides was similar to the number used for the stems, superposition of the structures in the region of loop 2 is not as good, partly because of a lack of torsion angle constraints for these residues. The average RMSD for the loop ° 2 nucleotides is 2.2 A. The overall conformation of the pseudoknot APK is not straight, but bent. The angle between the two stems of the pseudoknot was calculated to be 108 (28)° by generating helix axes for the two stems using the program NEWHEL93 (R. E. Dickerson, University of California, Los Angeles). A detailed picture of one of the pseudoknot structures is shown in Figure 7, with the phosphate backbone highlighted by a ribbon representation. The phosphate backbone from G9 to C21 is a continuous A-form helix with a small perturbation at the junction of stem 1 and stem 2. On the opposite strand, the two stem regions (G1 to C5 and G28 to C31) are stacked in A-form geometry. One striking feature of the pseudoknot APK is that the two stems are not coaxial. There are two intervening nucleotides stacked between the stems, which are thus twisted relative to each other to produce an open conformation. The U13·A27 base-pair does not form, contrary to the expected secondary structure shown in Figure 1. These flexible junction nucleotides and the short effective length of loop 2 discussed below cause the two stems to bend relative to each other. Structure model building (Pleij et al., 1985) and NMR studies (Puglisi et al., 1990) showed that for coaxial pseudoknots in which the two stems are stacked to form a quasi-continuous helix, loop 1 crosses the deep major groove of stem 2 and loop 2 crosses the shallow minor groove of stem 1. This crossing pattern of loops in the grooves results from the right-handed stacking of the stems, and the right-handed stacking of the strands at the ends of the stems of the pseudoknot. As seen in the structure of the pseudoknot APK, loop 1 crosses the deep major groove of stem 2 as expected. However, loop 2 does not cross the minor groove of stem 1, although continuous right-handed stacking of the residues G9 to C19 is present in APK. This finding seems surprising at first sight; however, the twisting of the stems caused by the presence of two intervening nucleotides in APK moves loop 2 away from the minor groove of stem 1. In order to learn whether we could generate structures of the pseudoknot APK in which loop 2 does cross the minor groove of stem 1, we did a series of computer modeling studies by systematically modifying the NOE constraint file used. We wanted to learn what constraints determined the structure, and what constraints were needed to produce a different structure. First, U13·A27 base-pair was forced to form, thus adding a base-pair to stem 2 and leaving only one nucleotide, A14, at the junction of two stems. Loop 2 now crosses the minor groove of stem 1 in this model

out of ten starting structures converged to this lower energy category. Subsequent refinement calculations were done on the global folded structures with lower total energies and NOE violations. The same NOE restraints file used for global folding was used for refinement. The dihedral restraints file, however, was modified for the refinement calculation: 77 A-form backbone torsion angle constraints were added for the nucleotides in both stems as described in Materials and Methods. The refined structures were subjected to a final energy minimization calculation. The calculated structures were judged by monitoring their NOE violations; none of the final structures has any individual distance con° straint violation of greater than 0.2 A. Figure 6 shows the four converged structures superimposed on the basis of all atoms. The phosphate backbones of the molecule are represented to show the overall conformation. Although the structures are not determined at high resolution, superposition of the structures in the region of both stems is fairly good. The precision of the structures was evaluated by calculating their root mean square deviation (RMSD) for all atoms relative to the averaged structure. The average

Figure 7. Stereo view of one of the four low-energy structures of pseudoknot APK. Both stems and loops are colored differently so that four regions of the molecule can be distinguished. Two unpaired intervening nucleotides (red) are stacked between stem 1 (blue) and stem 2 (white). The two stems are not coaxial, they are twisted and bent relative to each other. Loop 1 (green) crosses the deep major groove of stem 2 as usual, but loop 2 (yellow) does not cross the shallow minor groove of stem 1, in contrast to other pseudoknot structures.

pseudoknot, indicating that two unpaired nucleotides, not one unpaired nucleotide, at the junction of two stems is important. Next, the effect of loop size and the stacking interaction between loop nucleotides was tested, since it appeared that loop 2 is not long enough to cross the minor groove of stem 1. Although a loop size of eight nucleotides is calculated to be long enough to bridge the minor groove of a five base-pair A-form helix (Pleij et al., 1985), continuous stacking of A20 and C21 on top of the stem 1 increases the apparent size of stem 1 to six or seven base-pairs. In addition, base stacking between nucleotides in loop 2 keeps the backbone of the loop from adopting an extended conformation, thus limiting the effective distance by which loop 2 can cross the minor groove. Therefore we removed some stacking interactions, either between residue C19 and A20 or between C21 to A27 in loop 2, and repeated the calculation. This breaking of stacking interactions makes the effective length of loop 2 longer. Not surprisingly, we were able to generate low energy pseudoknot structures in which loop 2 crosses the minor groove of stem 1. These modeling results indicate that, for the non-coaxial RNA pseudoknot with intervening nucleotides at the junction of stem 1 and stem 2, various conformations can be obtained depending on the number of unpaired nucleotides at the junction, the size of the loop, and the type of the stacking interaction between the nucleotides in the loop. All of these calculations illustrate how sensitive the pseudoknot conformation is to small changes in junction and loop conformation.

Stability and frameshifting efficiency of the mutant pseudoknot APK + CCC To test the effect of thermodynamic stability of pseudoknots on frameshifting efficiency, we have generated a mutant APK + CCC by inserting three C residues between U8 and G9, and a G after G32 in APK (Figure 1). Formation of the pseudoknot conformation for this mutant pseudoknot was confirmed by T1, S1, and V1 mapping experiments. All of the experimental details are described by Chen et al. (1995). Now, this mutant pseudoknot has two extra G·C base-pairs at the bottom of stem 2, still leaving two unpaired nucleotides at the junction of the two stems as in APK. This change should stabilize stem 2 by about -3.2 kcal mol-1 in free energy at 37°C (Turner et al., 1988). Although absolute calculations of thermodynamic stabilities of pseudoknots are difficult because of unknown free energy contribution from the loops and their potential interactions with the stems, relative stabilities of similar pseudoknot structures should be reliable. The free energy at 37°C of stem 2 in this mutant pseudoknot APK + CCC (-10.0 kcal mol-1 ) is calculated to be lower than that in the counter part of the frameshifting pseudoknot VPK (-8.6 kcal mol-1 ). UV melting experiments also indicate that thermal melting temperature of this mutant pseudoknot APK + CCC is higher than that of VPK (86 versus 72°C). The frameshifting efficiency was tested using an in vitro rabbit reticulocyte translation assay method (Chen et al., 1995). Although a small increase in the frameshift-

Therefore, it is possible that the absence of efficient frameshifting for APK may be due to the lower thermodynamic stability (especially of stem 2) of this RNA pseudoknot compared with VPK. To test the importance of thermodynamic stability in the lower frameshifting efficiency of APK, a thermodynamically more stable mutant, APK + CCC, was generated. Although mutant APK + CCC is more stable than frameshifting pseudoknot VPK, it does not promote efficient frameshifting. These results indicate that conformation is the dominant factor for promoting efficient frameshifting. It is likely that pseudoknot APK does not promote efficient frameshifting because it does not adopt the conformation recognized by factors in the translation machinery. However, it is important to determine the conformation of the mutant pseudoknot APK + CCC to test this hypothesis. By modeling RNA pseudoknot structures, we found that the crossing pattern of loops relative to stems in the pseudoknot depends on factors such as the number of intervening nucleotides between the stems, the loop sizes, and the amount of stacking interactions between nucleotides in the loops. For example, in pseudoknots with no intervening nucleotides, coaxial stacking of the stems and the continuous right-handed stacking make loop 1 cross the deep and narrow major groove of stem 2, and loop 2 cross the shallow and wide minor groove of stem 1. In pseudoknot APK, however, loop 2 does not cross the minor groove of stem 1, but moves away from the stem 1. The two stems are not coaxial and the effective length of loop 2 is not long enough to cross the minor groove of stem 1. APK is the first experimentally determined RNA pseudoknot in which loop 2 does not cross the minor groove of stem 1. In our modeling, we were able to generate a low energy pseudoknot APK in which loop 2 crosses the minor groove of stem 1 by breaking some stacking interactions between nucleotides in the loop 2. In particular, breaking the stacking interaction between C19 and A20 resulted in a calculated pseudoknot in which loop 2 crosses the minor groove of stem 1. This finding suggests that continuous stacking of the residues A20 and C21 on top of the stem 1 provides one of the main forces for determining the orientation of loop 2 relative to stem 1 in APK. A change in sequence of loop 2 that changes the stacking between residues can probably change the pseudoknot shape from linear to bent, or can change the position of the loop from one groove to another. Thus changing A20 to a weaker stacking base, such as U, in APK should change the conformation and change the frameshifting. In conclusion, we clearly show that the nonframeshifting RNA pseudoknot APK possesses structural features that are distinctly different from the frameshifting RNA pseudoknot VPK, although their stem and loop sequences are nearly identical. This supports the hypothesis that for efficient

ing efficiency was observed for this mutant pseudoknot APK + CCC compared to the parent pseudoknot APK, mutant APK + CCC frameshifts far less efficiently than VPK (Figure 1).

Discussion
The non-frameshifting RNA pseudoknot APK, which is similar in sequence to that of the efficient frameshifting pseudoknot VPK, contains very different structural features from those of the frameshifting pseudoknot. The unique conformation of the APK is determined by two unpaired nucleotides between stem 1 and stem 2, in contrast to only one unpaired nucleotide observed for the VPK. The two intervening nucleotides twist the stems relative to each other. Thus, the two stems are not coaxial and loop 2 does not cross the shallow minor groove of stem 1. Mutational studies (Chen et al., 1995) had previously shown that simply forming a pseudoknot structure is not enough, but that structural features induced by one unpaired nucleotide at the junction of stem 1 and stem 2 are required for efficient frameshifting in MMTV. Chen et al. (1995) generated a mutant pseudoknot by inserting a G residue between U13 and A14 in VPK (see Figure 1), thus having two unpaired nucleotides at the junction of two stems. The frameshifting efficiency of this mutant pseudoknot went down dramatically to 2%. We predict that this mutant pseudoknot has a structure similar to APK, not VPK. One common structural feature of the frameshifting and the non-frameshifting pseudoknots is that the two stems are not straight, but are bent with respect to one another. However, the frameshifting and non-frameshifting pseudoknots bend in different directions. In VPK the bending is toward the major groove of stem 1; it is in the opposite direction for APK. Thus, simply bending the RNA pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote efficient ribosomal frameshifting. Rather, it is likely that the specific conformation, as observed for the frameshifting pseudoknot VPK, is required for efficient frameshifting. How the specific conformation of an RNA pseudoknot is recognized by a ribosome or ribosome-related factors remains to be discovered. The thermodynamic stabilities of pseudoknots, as well as their structures, should be considered for understanding frameshifting. Several lines of evidence by mutational studies show that decreasing the stability of either stem of a pseudoknot lowers the frameshifting efficiency (Brierley et al., 1991; ten Dam et al., 1995). Since stem 2 of APK contains only four base-pairs compared with six base-pairs for VPK, APK should be less stable than VPK. UV melting experiments indicate that the thermal melting temperature of the pseudoknot APK is about 8°C lower than that of VPK (64 versus 72°C). This difference of thermal stability is consistent with the faster exchange rates of the imino protons of the base-pairs in APK compared with VPK with

144 frameshifting to occur, a specific conformation of the RNA pseudoknot downstream of the shift site must be recognized by the translating ribosome or ribosome-bound protein factors. Identification of the factors that recognize a specific RNA pseudoknot conformation should provide a better understanding of the mechanism of frameshifting and of the replication of retroviruses.

Non-frameshifting RNA Pseudoknot

Materials and Methods
RNA synthesis and purification Oligoribonucleotides were synthesized in vitro from DNA templates by using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Milligan et al., 1987; Wyatt et al., 1991). DNA templates were synthesized on an Applied Biosystem 381A and purified by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (7 M urea). RNA oligonucleotides were purified by 20% denaturing-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The RNA transcripts were visualized by UV shadowing, were excised, were eluted from the gel by electroelution (Schleicher & Schuell Co.), and were precipitated with ethanol. The purified RNA was dialyzed extensively against 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, against 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, and finally against 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 . The sequences of the oligoribonucleotides were verified by partial digestion of 5' end-labeled RNA with base-specific RNases A, T1 , U2 , and CL3 . Ultraviolet melting studies were done to verify that the folded structures formed were monomeric even at high strand concentrations. The secondary structures of RNA oligonucleotides were probed by using nuclease S1 and RNase V1 (Wyatt et al., 1990), and by using the reagent NiCR (Chen et al., 1995). Selective

C-labeling of RNA

Labeled oligoribonucleotides were synthesized in vitro using selectively 13C-labeled nucleoside triphosphates. 13 C-labeled nucleoside phosphates were synthesized chemically, and phosphorylated enzymatically to yield nucleoside triphosphates as described (Hines et al., 1994; SantaLucia et al., 1995). RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized using 13C8-labeled ATP and 13C6-labeled UTP, and unlabeled GTP and CTP. In these 13C-labeled RNA oligonucleotides, since the CA step in oligoribonucleotides is highly susceptible to hydrolysis (Kierzek, 1992), the C23­A24 step in the loop 2 of pseudoknot APK (see Figure 1) was changed to C23­G24 in order to reduce RNA cleavage. This modification in loop sequence does not affect the frameshifting efficiency of the APK in MMTV (data not shown). 13C-labeled RNAs were purified and treated using the same procedures as described above. NMR experiments All NMR spectra were obtained on a GE GN-500 spectrometer or a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer. The oligoribonucleotides were in 10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2 . All measurements were made at 25°C, unless otherwise specified. Samples used in exchangeable proton experiments were prepared by adding a 10:1 mixture of H2 O and 2H2 O to dry RNA.

For non-exchangeable proton experiments, RNA was lyophilized several times with 99.9% 2H2 O in the NMR tube and finally dissolved in 0.4 ml of 99.96% 2H2 O (Aldrich) to a final concentration of about 2 mM. One-dimensional (1D) exchangeable proton spectra were recorded by using the 1331 solvent suppression scheme (Hore, 1983) with 12,000 Hz sweep width. The excitation maximum was set between the imino and aromatic resonance regions. Data were processed using FTNMR (Hare Research, Inc.). All two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the TPPI method (Marion & Wuthrich, 1983) and preirradiation of the ¨ residual H2HO peak. Typically, 2 K complex points in t2 and 370 to 450 FIDs in t1 were collected with spectral widths of 4700 to 5000 Hz. The total relaxation delay was 2.5 seconds. Data were processed using FTNMR and FELIX (Biosym Technologies, Inc) on a Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation. Non-exchangeable NOESY spectra were recorded at different mixing times (60, 150, and 300 ms) by using the experimental scheme of Macura & Ernst (1980). A total of 48 to 64 scans were averaged for each FID; the total acquisition time was 20 to 24 hours. Multiple-quantum contributions were eliminated by incrementing the mixing time with t1 (Macura et al., 1982). Data were zero-filled to 2 K real points in t1 , and were apodized by using phase-shifted sine bells in both dimensions. The same data were apodized with different phase shifts to improve resolution (15 to 30° phase shift) or signal/noise (50 to 90° phase shift). Exchangeable NOESY spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 12,000 Hz and a mixing time of 300 ms. Spectra were obtained at 10°C with a 1 1 water suppression sequence replacing the last pulse (Plateau & Gueron, 1982). 4 K complex points were collected in t2 , and approximately 350 FIDs in t1 . Totally correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments were acquired by using MLEV-17 for broad band decoupling (Bax & Davis, 1985), with a long mixing time (120 ms) to maximize relayed magnetization transfer from the H1' protons to the other sugar protons. Double-quantum filtered-COSY (DQF-COSY) spectra were collected by using the pulse sequence with composite mixing pulses (Muller et al., 1986). For high-resolution DQF¨ COSY, broad-band phosphorus decoupling was achieved by GARP1 (Shaka et al., 1985), and a narrow sweep width (2000 Hz) was used for 4 K complex data points. A total of 712 FIDs was collected with 32 scans. The spectra were apodized with 30° shifted sine bells. Natural abundance 13C­1H heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) were recorded at 600 MHz using a standard pulse sequence (Bax et al., 1983; Varani & Tinoco, 1991) with spectral widths of 20,000 Hz ( 13C) and 5000 Hz ( 1H), and the GARP1 carbon decoupling during acquisition. Approximately 180 to 200 FIDs of 2 K complex points were recorded, and 256 scans were averaged for each FID. The data were apodized using a sine bell function with a 60° phase shift in both dimensions. 1/2 X-filtered NOESY experiments were done on selectively 13C-labeled RNA samples using 13C and 12C editing (Otting & Wuthrich, 1990). The H2HO peak was ¨ suppressed by preirridiation during the relaxation delay and the mixing time. Heteronuclear 1H­13C decoupling was obtained by using a composite 180° pulse on 13C in t1 and by using the WALTZ-16 sequence in t2 . Two FIDs were collected for every t1 increment, with or without a 180° 13C editing pulse prior to the t1 evolution period. Approximately 650 to 800 FIDs were collected with 32

energy minimization were performed for the global fold. Structures with lower total energies and fewer NOE violations from the global fold were subjected to the refinement calculation. This involved: 500 cycles of initial energy minimization, rMD at 1000 K with backbone torsion angle constraints for the stem regions introduced in two steps (b, g, e first, a, z second) according to Wimberly (1992), rMD while cooling to 300 K, and 1000 cycles of subsequent energy minimization. The force ° constants for the NOEs were set to 50 kcal mol-1 A-2, and the torsion angle force constants were varied between 5 and 50 kcal mol-1 rad-2 during the calculations. Finally, 1500 cycles of energy minimization were performed for the refined structures with Lennard-Jones potentials and electrostatic energies on. The refined structures were examined for NOE violations, and viewed using INSIGHT II (Biosym Technologies, Inc.) on a Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation.

scans for 2 K complex data points for each FID; total acquisition time was 22 to 30 hours. The sweep width was 5000 Hz in both dimensions. The two FIDs collected with the same t1 increment provided a 12C sub-spectrum, and subtraction produced a 13C sub-spectrum. Both spectra were zero filled to 2 K real points in t1 , and were apodized using phase-shifted sine bells in both dimensions. Interproton distances and scalar coupling measurements Interproton distances between non-exchangeable protons were evaluated from the cross-peak intensities in NOESY experiments at short mixing times (60 and 150 ms). Cross-peak volume integration was performed using FTNMR and FELIX (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). The cross-peaks were classified into four categories: strong, medium, weak, and very weak. The strong and medium cross-peaks in 60 ms mixing time NOESY were ° ° given a distance range of 1.8 to 3.0 A and 2.0 to 4.0 A, respectively. Medium to weak cross-peaks in 150 ms mixing time NOESY were given a distance range of 2.5 to 5.0, and extra weak cross-peaks in 150 ms NOESY were ° assigned a distance range of 3.5 to 6.0 A. A total of 218 non-exchangeable proton distance constraints obtained from the 2H2 O NOESY spectra. For imino to imino proton ° distances, a distance range of 3.2 to 4.5 A was assigned to the cross-peaks observed in the H2 O NOESY spectra. In addition to these NOE constraints, some empirical constraints were used to maintain hydrogen bonding between base-paired nucleotides and to keep the base-pairs planar. 1 H­1H scalar couplings were measured in phosphorusdecoupled high-resolution DQF­COSY spectra. The sugar pucker conformations were determined from the H1'­H2' scalar couplings; the nucleotides without observable H1'­H2' couplings were restrained to be C-3'-endo with endocyclic torsion angles n0 , n1 , n2 , and n3 . The glycosidic torsion angle x was chosen anti for all nucleotides, based on the lack of strong intranucleotide H8/H6 to H1' cross-peaks in the NOESY spectra. In addition to the torsion angles for maintaining correct sugar pucker conformations and for keeping anti orientations of the bases relative to the sugars, empirical constraints to keep the amino groups in the planes of the bases were used during the global folding of the RNA. During refinement of the pseudoknot structure backbone torsion angle constraints (a, b, g, e, and z) derived from the standard values for A-form helices (Saenger, 1984) were added to the torsion angle constraint file for the base-pairs in the stems of the pseudoknot. Structure determination The simulated annealing and restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) was ¨ used with empirical nucleic acids force fields, which included bond lengths, bond angles, van der Waals' interaction, and improper angles, as well as experimental distance and torsion angle constraints derived from the NMR data. Ten starting structures with randomized torsion angles a, b, g, e, and z were generated using the internal coordinate facility of X-PLOR. Global folds were calculated using a simulated annealing strategy, which used only the repulsive van der Waals' term, and no electrostatic interactions. 500 cycles of initial energy minimization, followed by rMD as the temperature is cooled from 1000 K to 300 K, and finally 1000 cycles of
