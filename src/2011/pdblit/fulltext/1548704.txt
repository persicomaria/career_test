Summary: Determination by X-ray analysis of the absolute configuration of uridine 3'-O-thiophosphate methyl ester obtained by the reaction of uridine 2',3'-O,O-cyclothiophosphate with pancreatic ribonuclease in aqueous methanol, establishes an inline mechanism for the transesterification reaction of this enzyme.

Pancreatic ribonuclease A hydrolizes ribonucleic acids in a two-step mechanism, the first a transesterification step to

a cyclic phosphate and the second a hydrolysis step opening the ring to a pyrimidine nucleoside 3'-phosphate. A number of mechanisms for these two reactions have been proposed (i), which

basically can be classified as in-line or adjacent

(2), as

illustrated for the hydrolysis of uridine 2',3'-cyclophosphate in Fig. I. Both mechanisms can be visualized as proceeding

through a pentacoordinated phosphorous intermediate in the form of a trigonal bipyramid as discussed by Westheimer (3). The

adjacent mechanism requires pseudo-rotation of this pentacoordinate phosphorous intermediate whereas the in-line mechanism does not. To distinguish between the two mechanisms by identification of the reaction product, we recently synthesized uridine 2',3'-O,O-cyclophosphorothioate (4), a compound with an asymmetric

decline of the X-ray intensities with increasing qlancing angle only 2243 data up to · = 20 ° were collected. The data were converted to normalized structure factors, and the phase problem was solved by cyclic application of the tangent formula in a multi solution technique approach of eight starting reflections from ~l-relationships, (7). The phase information two

three additional reflections whose was

phases were allowed to vary by 45 ° and 18o ° respectively) extended to include all the E'-s greater than 1.4. From the resulting 64 phase sets the most reliable was selected by

consistency criteria. An E-map based on this phase set revealed the atomic positions of the two nucleotide molecules but not the triethylammonium cations. At the present stage the atoms of the cations can not be located unambiguously since they are apparently disordered. The residual index R =~llFol - I F c ~ I / ~ I F o ~ is 32 % .

Although the refinement of the structural details is far from complete, the essential features are clear.

The two molecules are related to each other by a pseudotwofold screw axis which gives rise to almost identical conformational characteristics (figure 2).
