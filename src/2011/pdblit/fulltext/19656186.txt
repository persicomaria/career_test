The ATP­pyrophosphate exchange reaction catalyzed by Arg-tRNA, GlntRNA and Glu-tRNA synthetases requires the assistance of the cognate tRNA. tRNA also assists Arg-tRNA synthetase in catalyzing the pyrophosphorolysis of synthetic Arg-AMP at low pH. The mechanism by which the 3¢-end A76, and in particular its hydroxyl group, of the cognate tRNA is involved with the exchange reaction catalyzed by those enzymes has yet to be established. We determined a crystal structure of a complex of ArgtRNA synthetase from Pyrococcus horikoshii, tRNAArgCCU and an ATP ° analog with Rfactor = 0.213 (Rfree = 0.253) at 2.0 A resolution. On the basis of newly obtained structural information about the position of ATP bound on the enzyme, we constructed a structural model for a mechanism in which the formation of a hydrogen bond between the 2¢-OH group of A76 of tRNA and the carboxyl group of Arg induces both formation of Arg-AMP (Arg + ATP fi Arg-AMP + pyrophosphate) and pyrophosphorolysis of Arg-AMP (Arg-AMP + pyrophosphate fi Arg + ATP) at low pH. Furthermore, we obtained a structural model of the molecular mechanism for the Arg-tRNA synthetase-catalyzed deacylation of ArgtRNA (Arg-tRNA + AMP fi Arg-AMP + tRNA at high pH), in which the deacylation of aminoacyl-tRNA bound on Arg-tRNA synthetase and Glu-tRNA synthetase is catalyzed by a quite similar mechanism, whereby the proton-donating group (­NH­C+(NH2)2 or ­COOH) of Arg and Glu assists the aminoacyl transfer from the 2¢-OH group of tRNA to the phosphate group of AMP at high pH.

Introduction
Most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) catalyze the formation of aminoacyl-AMP in the presence of Mg2+ [amino acid + ATP fi aminoacyl-AMP + pyrophosphate (PPi)] and the reverse reaction (aminoacyl-AMP + PPi fi amino acid + ATP). Thus, the amino acid is converted into the reactive intermediate,

i.e. aminoacyl-AMP, and then the aminoacyl-AMP bound on the aaRS may react with the hydroxyl group of the ribose at the 3¢-end CCA of tRNA to form aminoacyl-tRNA. In the aminoacylation reaction of class I aaRSs with aminoacyl-AMP, the 2¢-OH group of the ribose of A76 tRNA attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of the ­Ca­(CO)­O­ moiety of aminoacyl-AMP. As little detailed structural information on the ATP-binding site of class Ia and class Ib aaRSs has been reported, clear molecular-scientific understanding of the activated complex formed between the amino acid and ATP in the reaction path of aminoacyl-AMP formation on the aaRSs has not been attained yet. In particular, the following detailed biochemical findings on the formation of aminoacyl-AMP and closely related reactions have been reported for Arg-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS; EC 6.1.1.19) [1­6]. No success of consistent understanding has been achieved for the molecular reaction paths of aminoacyl-AMP formation and closely related reactions catalyzed by ArgRS. New models of the reaction paths involved in the formation of aminoacyl-AMP and closely related reactions observed for ArgRS will lead to improved understanding of the activated complex formed between the amino acid and ATP in the reaction path of aminoacyl-AMP formation on most aaRSs as well as ArgRS. For most aaRSs, the formation of aminoacyl-AMP does not require tRNA. On the other hand, for ArgRS from Escherichia coli, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Neurospora crassa, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae [1­5], Gln-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) from E. coli W, S. cerevisiae and porcine liver [7,8] and Glu-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) from E. coli K12 [9,10], the ATP­PPi exchange reaction corresponding to the formation of aminoacyl-AMP and its reverse reaction, amino acid + ATP = aminoacyl-AMP + PPi, has never been observed without tRNA. In the presence of cognate tRNA, the ATP­PPi exchange reaction was observed for ArgRS, GlnRS, and GluRS. The cognate tRNA is also necessary for the ArgRScatalyzed pyrophosphorolysis of chemically synthesized Arg-AMP in the presence of PPi and Mg2+ [6]. It has also been reported that the in vitro ArgRS-catalyzed deacylation reaction of Arg-tRNA follows good firstorder kinetics in solution at pH 6 containing excess amount of AMP, PPi, and Mg2+, whereas in the absence of PPi, the amount of Arg-tRNA decreases to 43% and then remains constant [11]. The detailed mechanism through which the 2¢-OH group of the ribose of the 3¢-end A76 of the cognate tRNA accelerates the ATP­PPi exchange reaction in the case of ArgRS remained unknown. In order to
4764

gain a clear molecular-scientific understanding of this mechanism and to clarify the orientation of the dihydrouridine (D) loop containing A20 of tRNAArg interacting with ArgRS, we determined crystal structures of a binary complex of Pyrococcus horikoshii ArgRS and tRNAArgCCU and a ternary complex also containing the ATP analog adenosine-5¢-(b,c-imido)triphosphate (ANP); we found one reasonable mechanism, based on newly obtained structural information about the position of ATP bound on ArgRS. In order to understand the function of the N-terminal domain of ArgRS in relation to the binding mechanism of tRNAArg, we constructed an ArgRS mutant lacking the N-terminal domain (DN ArgRS). The experimental results showed that the DN ArgRS protein retains sufficient catalytic activity in the aminoacylation reaction for tRNAArgCCU. Moreover, modeling of the relative positions of Arg, A76 of tRNAArg and ATP on ArgRS was undertaken to find the suitable position for the tRNA-assisted mechanism of Arg-AMP formation. We found that the formation of the hydrogen bond between the 2¢-OH group of A76 of tRNA and O2 of the carboxyl group induces the ATP­PPi exchange reaction and the pyrophosphorolysis reaction of synthetic Arg-AMP at low pH.

Results
Comparison of P. horikoshii ArgRS with those of Thermus thermophilus and S. cerevisiae The structures of the ternary complex (P. horikoshii ArgRS, tRNAArgCCU, and the ATP analog ANP) and the binary complex (P. horikoshii ArgRS and tRNAArgCCU) were obtained with Rfactor = 0.213 ° (Rfree = 0.253) at 2.0 A resolution, and Rfactor = 0.201 ° (Rfree = 0.262) at 2.3 A, respectively. In the crystals grown in the presence of l-Arg, l-Arg was not visible in the electron density map. The overall structure of a ternary complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS, tRNAArgCCU and the ATP analog is shown in Fig. 1, and sequence alignments for ArgRSs from P. horikoshii, T. thermophilus and S. cerevisiae on the basis on three-dimensional structures are given in Fig. 2.

Fig. 1. Overview of the structure of P. horikoshii ArgRS complexed with tRNAArgCCU and ATP analog (ANP). P. horikoshii ArgRS contains the N-terminal domain (residues 2­118; yellow), the catalytic domain [the Rossmann fold domain (residues 119­169, 238­269, 331­345, and 378­417; orange], the inserted domain 1 (residues 170­237; cyan), the connective polypeptide domain (residues 270­ 330; blue), the inserted domain 2 (residues 346­377; green), the `stem contact fold' domain (residues 418­503; red), and the anticodon-binding domain (residues 504­629; magenta). The tRNA backbone is drawn with its phosphate chain traced as a thick green line, and ANP is shown in ball-and-stick representation.

gives a drastically decreased kcat value of 0.01 s)1 in the aminoacylation reaction in comparison with the kcat value of 8 s)1 for the wild-type ArgRS [14]. In S. cerevisiae ArgRS bound to Arg and tRNA, the a-NH2 group of Arg is in close proximity to the carbamoyl group of Asn153 in the loop between S5 and the signature sequence motif `HIGH'. In the three ArgRSs, an Asn with the same conformation was observed. The large difference found in the catalytic domain between P. horikoshii ArgRS and S. cerevisiae ArgRS concerns the relative orientations of the connective polypeptide domain and the inserted domain 1 to the Rossmann fold domain (Fig. 3A). In S. cerevisiae ArgRS, superimposition of `tRNA-free' S. cerevisiae ArgRS on `tRNA-bound' S. cerevisiae ArgRS reveals large movements of these domains [12]. Binding site of adenosine of ATP In Met-tRNA, Ile-tRNA, Val-tRNA and Leu-tRNA synthetases [15­18] belonging to class Ia, crystal structures of complexes of aminoacyl-AMP analog bound mainly through the hydrophobic interaction of the aminoacyl moiety have been observed, whereas no

ATP-bound protein of class Ia has been observed. In P. horikoshii ArgRS, the ATP analog (ANP) molecule was clearly found in the active site (Fig. 4). The observation of the ANP-bound protein is due to the high hydrophobicity of ArgRS from the archaebacterium P. horikoshii living at very high temperature and the existence of the His417 residue. The adenine base of ANP with small values of average B-factor is stacked upon the aromatic ring of His417, which is specific to P. horikoshii ArgRS. The adenine base is in close proximity to the main chain of Val418 in the S16 strand, the N1­Val418 N and N6­Val418 O distances being ° ° 3.19 A and 3.47 A, respectively, and the 2¢-OH of the ribose is in close proximity to N of Gly384 and Oe1 of Glu386 in the S14­H14 turn (Gly384­Ala385­Glu386­ ° ° Gln387 turn), the distances being 2.71 A and 2.77 A, respectively. The distance between Ca of Glu386, the third residue in the S14­H14 turn, and Ca of Val418 ° in the S16 strand is 12.8 A, and the adenosine moiety is fitted into this hydrophobic groove. The Ala372­ Ser373­Gln374­Gln375 turn in S. cerevisiae ArgRS and the Asp354­Val355­Arg356­Gln357 turn in T. thermophilus ArgRS have very similar backbone forms to that of the S14­H14 turn in P. horikoshii ArgRS. In aaRSs belonging to class I, the turn corresponding to the S14­H14 turn is almost conserved, as Gly / Ala-Xaa-Asp / Glu-Xaa (Xaa stands for any amino acid) and NH and C@O of the main chain of the residue corresponding to Val418 in the S16 strand are directed inside. In free E. coli Met-tRNA synthetase (Protein Data Bank ID: 1QQT) [19], the distance between Ca of the third residue, Asp296, in the S14­ H14 turn and Ca of Val326 in the S16 strand is ° 12.7 A, in free T. thermophilus Ile-tRNA synthetase (Protein Data Bank ID: 1ILE) [20], the distance between the Ca atoms of the corresponding Asp553 ° and Ile584 is 13.4 A, in free P. horikoshii Leu-tRNA synthetase (Protein Data Bank ID: 1WKB) [21], the ° distance between Asp612 and Gly644 is 12.5 A, and in free T. thermophilus Val-tRNA synthetase (Protein Data Bank ID: 1IYW) [22], the distance between ° Asp490 and Val521 is 11.9 A. These distances within ° of the distance of 12.8 A in ArgRS indicate that, ° 0.9 A in these aaRSs, this space is the binding site of the adenosine moiety of ATP, and in E. coli Cys-tRNA synthetase bound to tRNACys (Protein Data Bank ID: 1U0B) [23], the distance between Asp229 and Val260 ° is 11.4 A. AMP weakly inhibits the binding of ATP in a competitive manner in the aminoacylation reaction [24].

° within 3.5 A of protein residues. The observed electron density for the Mg2+ in this conformation is about half of the electron density expected for an occupancy of 1.0 for Mg2+. The presence of different orientations for the PbNPc moiety of ANP attached and not attached to Mg2+ is manifested as low electron densities in the regions of Mg2+ and the PbNPc moiety. The salt bridge formed by Mg2+ between PbO and PaO may retard the conformational inversion at Pa of ATP in the reversible process of the ATP­PPi exchange reaction, whereas the salt bridge formed by Mg2+ between PbO and PcO does not, by any means, retard the conformational inversion at Pa of ATP. The reported aminoacyl-AMP analogs have sulfamoyl (­NH­SO2­O­) or diaminosulfone (­NH­SO2­ NH­) in place of Pa [­O­PO(OH)­O­] of AMP. Furthermore, the reported aminoacyl-AMP analogs are bound mainly through the interaction of the aminoacyl moiety with the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Therefore, the location of the adenosine moiety of the reported aminoacyl-AMP analogs may be somewhat perturbed by the strong binding of the aminoacyl

moiety on the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The conformation of the sulfamoyl or diaminosulfone of the reported aminoacyl-AMP analogs may be also somewhat perturbed by the strong binding of the aminoacyl moiety. For instance, the torsional angles of C3¢­C4¢­ C5¢­O5¢ / N¢ around the C4¢­C5¢ bond in ribose moieties of Ile-AMP analog [N-(isoleucinyl)-N¢-(adenosyl)diaminosufone] (Protein Data Bank ID: 1JZQ) and Val-AMP analog [N-(valinyl)-N¢-(adenosyl)-diaminosufone] (Protein Data Bank ID: 1GAX) are 52° and )169°, respectively. In contrast, the newly found location of the adenosine moiety of the ATP analog (ANP) is considered to be free from any perturbation. The conformation of Pa [­O­PO(OH)­O­] of ANP is also considered to be substantially free from any perturbation. Thus, the conformation of Pa [­O­PO(OH)­O­] of ANP is very suitable for use in constructing the model of the tRNAArg-assisted ATP­PPi exchange reaction. The N of the side chain of Lys132, located three residues upstream from the signature sequence motif `HIGH', is close to PaO, PbO and PcO of ANP, with

Gly427, the first Lys424 of the current structure undergoes no interaction with the PbNPc moiety of ANP proves that, in P. horikoshii ArgRS, the `KFSG' portion does not contribute to the ATP­PPi exchange reaction. The 3¢-terminus of tRNA In the 3¢-terminal G73­C74­C75­A76 sequence of tRNAArgCCU, two transient forms were observed in the ternary complex (Fig. 5A) as well in the binary complex, depending on crystallization conditions; in the first stage, the base of G73 is stacked upon a G1ÆC72 base pair, and the conformation of the phosphodiester bridge of C5¢­O­P­O­C3¢ between C72 and G73 is normal. This unusual structure was first observed by NMR analysis in the tRNAAla acceptor end microhelix [25]. The C74­C75­A76 sequence is invisible in the electron density map, which indicates clearly that increased conformational flexibility around G73 is provided in the first stage. In another conformation of the 3¢-terminal end of tRNAArgCCU in the second stage, the base of G73 is not stacked upon a G1ÆC72 base pair, and the conformation of the phosphodiester bridge of C5¢­O­P­O­C3¢ between C72­ G73 and G73­C74 is not of the normal helix type. This local conformation of C72­G73­C74 of the second stage is quite similar to the final stage conformation observed for tRNAArgICG bound to S. cerevisiae ArgRS in the tertiary complex [12]. The ribose of G73 and the bases of C75­A76 are invisible in the electron density map. Therefore, this newly observed transient form is the intermediate form, through which the conformation of the 3¢-terminal end changes from the first stage to the final stage. The base of C74 is found near the surface of the connective polypeptide domain, which is a transient position, i.e. the hydrophobic cleft constructed by the side chains of Tyr300, Ala303, Val321, Arg324 and Ser325 in the connective polypeptide domain. The relative orientation of G73 and C74 to the connective polypeptide domain is similar to that

observed in tRNAArgICG bound to S. cerevisiae ArgRS in the tertiary complex. It is predicted that the conformational change from the first stage to the final stage takes place in the absence of Arg, and the hydrophobic circumstance changes the hydration state around the phosphodiester bridges in C72­G73­C74­ C75­A76. In T. thermophilus Val-tRNA synthetase bound to tRNAVal (Protein Data Bank ID: 1GAX) [17] and T. thermophilus Leu-tRNA synthetase bound to tRNALeu (Protein Data Bank ID: 2BYT) [26], tRNA is left in the first stage, where the base of A73 is stacked on a G1ÆC72 base pair. Moreover, in Aquifex aeolicus Met-tRNA synthetase bound to tRNAMet (Protein Data Bank ID: 2CSX) [27], the base of A73 is still stacked on a G1ÆC72 base pair; that is, the change of the conformation of the 3¢-terminal end of tRNAMet does not progress. On the other hand, in E. coli Cys-tRNA synthetase bound to tRNACys (Protein Data Bank ID: 1U0B) [23], the structure such that the base of U73 is no longer stacked on a

G1ÆC72 base pair allows the 3¢-terminal CCA end to enter into the active site. The D-loop of tRNAArg Among all tRNA species specific to each of the 20 amino acids, only tRNAArg isoacceptors have A at position 20 on the D-loop, with the exception that four tRNAArg isoacceptors from S. cerevisiae have D or C. Detailed experiments with E. coli and T. thermophilus ArgRSs apparently suggested that the interaction with the middle base of the anticodon (C35) and A20 of tRNAArg play an important role in tRNAArg binding on ArgRS [13,28,29]. Crystal structures of binary and ternary complexes of ArgRS and tRNAArgICG from S. cerevisiae and Arg revealed that a base of D20 in the D-loop, which is specific to S. cerevisiae tRNAArgICG, is positioned in close proximity to the side chains of Asn106, Phe109, and Gln111, which are included in the characteristic N-terminal domain of ArgRS [12].

Modeling of tRNA-assisted mechanism on ArgRS

However, it was reported that, in the aminoacylation reaction, the kcat and Km values for tRNAArgICG and tRNAArgUCU on the Asn106 fi Ala, Phe109 fi Ala and Gln111 fi Ala mutant proteins of S. cerevisiae ArgRS are the same as those on the wild-type ArgRS [14]. This shows that the interaction between the N-terminal domain of S. cerevisiae ArgRS and D20 of the D-loop of tRNAArg are not important for the binding of tRNAArg on ArgRS in the aminoacylation reaction. The crystal structure of free ArgRS from T. thermophilus has been determined, but that of the complex with tRNAArg has not been determined yet [13]. In T. thermophilus ArgRS, the Tyr77 fi Ala and Asn79 fi Ala mutants (Tyr77 and Asn79 correspond to Phe109 and Gln111 of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, on the basis of structural comparison between S. cerevisiae ArgRS and T. thermophilus ArgRS) showed a notable increase in Km for tRNAArg and a large decrease in Vmax in the aminoacylation reaction at pH 7.5. On the other hand, it is very noticeable that the Asn79 fi Lys mutant, which is expected to be unable to form a hydrogen bond, has the same Km value for tRNAArg as that of the wild type and does not affect the affinity of tRNAArg. The additional N-terminal domain characteristic for ArgRS contains the core structure consisting of the b-sheet of four antiparallel b-strands and three helices on the N-terminal side and a long H4 helix and a loop continuing to the catalytic domain (Fig. 1). The core structure interacts weakly with the anticodon-binding domain. The hydrophobic interactions between the N-terminal domain and the bases of G19 and A20 in the complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS are shown in Fig. 5B. The bases of G18 and G19 of the D-loop form hydrogen bonds with the bases of U55 and C56 of the T-loop, respectively. The base of G19 interacts with the hydrophobic side chains of Pro44 and Phe47 in the N-terminal domain. The bases of A20 and C20a (extra nucleotide inserted between nucleotides 20 and 21) of the D-loop are splayed out. The base of A20 is packed into the hydrophobic space surrounded by the side chains of Val82 and Tyr85 in the turn (Val82-Asn83Gly84-Tyr85) between the S3 and S4 strands and the hydrophobic side chains of Pro34 and Leu38. N1 and N6 of the base of A20 lie close to Nd2 and Od1 of the side chain of Asn87 in the S4 strand, with ° ° distances of 2.82 A and 2.97 A, respectively. The plane of the base of A20 and the end plane of the carbamoyl group of Asn87 are out of coplanar orientation, and the dihedral angle between these two planes was about 25°. In particular, Od1 of the carbamoyl group of Asn87 is positioned far out of the base plane. Large values of average B-factor of resi-

dues in the N-terminal domain (average B-factors of residues 2­118 in the N-terminal domain and resi° dues 119­629 in other domains are 49.9 A2 and ° 2, respectively) indicate that the D-loop does 29.5 A not have stable contact with the N-terminal domain. The relative orientation of the core structure of the N-terminal domain to the Rossmann fold domain and the anticodon-binding domain is substantially different among P. horikoshii ArgRS, S. cerevisiae ArgRS, and T. thermophilus ArgRS (Fig. 3A,B). In S. cerevisiae ArgRS, the base of D20 is surrounded by hydrophobic side chains of Phe109 in the turn (Asn106-Gly107Pro108-Phe109) and Val70. O4 and N3 of D20 interact with Ne2 of Gln111 and Od1 of Asn106, with distances ° ° of 2.75 A and 2.74 A, respectively [12]. The solution at pH 7.5 of crystallization drops from which crystals of the ternary complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, Arg and tRNAArgICG grow contains tRNA, l-Arg, ATP and Mg2+ at sufficient concentrations for the aminoacylation reaction, and (NH4)2SO4 and 1,6-hexanediol are used as precipitating agents [30]. This fact indicates that, even though all of the substrates required for the aminoacylation reaction are present at sufficient concentration in the crystallization solution, the aminoacylation reaction does not occur during the long time needed for crystal growth, which suggests that tRNAbound S. cerevisiae ArgRS observed in the ternary complex is by no means in a conformation that is fit to activate. The fact that kcat and Km for tRNAArg in the aminoacylation reaction do not change in the Asn106 fi Ala, Gln111 fi Ala and Phe109 fi Ala mutants of S. cerevisiae ArgRS [14] indicates that those mutations have no influence on the orientation of tRNAArg in wild-type ArgRS. When the Rossmann fold domain and the anticodonbinding domain in P. horikoshii ArgRS were superimposed onto those of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, the C1s of A20 and C72 in P. horikoshii tRNAArg were not within ° 4.0 A of those of D20 and A72 in S. cerevisiae tRNAArg, respectively. The main chains of the phosphodiester bridge of C5¢­O5­P­O3­C3¢ of G18­G19­A20­ C20a in the D-loop in P. horikoshii tRNAArg have no common conformation with those of G18­G19­D20­ C20a in S. cerevisiae tRNAArgICG.

distances in S. cerevisiae tRNAArgICG. These facts indicate that the framework of tRNAArg of the L-shape is conserved in these two cases. The anticodon loop of tRNA In the complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS, the base of C35 of tRNAArgCCU is located in the hydrophobic pocket formed by the aromatic ring of Tyr587 at the C-terminal end of H23 and the hydrophobic side chains of Ile517 of H19 and Pro591, Val592 and Leu593 of the loop between H23 and H24 (Fig. 5C). N4H2 and O2 of C35 are found within the distance of the hydrogen bonds with the main chain CO of ° Tyr587 (N4­O distance 2.69 A) and with the main ° chain NH of Leu593 (O2­N distance 3.02 A) of the turn of the loop, respectively. The base of C34 undergoes no interaction with the protein. The base of U36 is surrounded by the side chains of Tyr509, Ala512 and Ser516 on H19, and the C-terminal carboxyl group of Met629 in the C-terminal end; and O4 of U36 is in close proximity to NH of Met629 (O4­N dis° tance 3.02 A). The base of A37 is stacked on a C31ÆG39 base pair, and the base of C32 is stacked on the base of A37. The base of A38 lies between the hydrophobic side chains of Leu451, Lys455 and Val471 in the `stem contact fold' domain and the side chains of Pro505 and Met629. In S. cerevisiae ArgRS, the base of C35 of tRNAArgICG is also located in the hydrophobic pocket formed by the aromatic ring of the conserved Tyr565. On the other hand, the report that the Km value for tRNAArgICG on S. cerevisiae ArgRS with Tyr565 replaced by Ala is identical to that on the wild-type ArgRS [14] indicates that this conserved Tyr makes little contribution to the recognition of the base of C35. The report that a few tRNAMetCAU molecules are aminoacylated by Arg with E. coli ArgRS [29] suggests that when the backbone of the anticodon stem is superimposed, the anticodon bases of tRNAMetCAU and tRNAArgCCG should be oriented in the same direction and bind to almost the same region in the helix bundle structure of E. coli ArgRS. The reported structure of T. thermophilus ArgRS also has a quite similar hydrophobic pocket to the hydrophobic pocket accepting C35 of tRNAArgCCU in the complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS and the hydrophobic pocket accepting C35 of tRNAArgICG in the complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS. The local structure accepting G36 of tRNAArgICG in the complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS is substantially equivalent to the local structure accepting U36 of tRNAArgCCU in the complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS. The reported struc4770

ture of T. thermophilus ArgRS also has a local structure that is quite similar to the local structure accepting U36 of tRNAArgCCU in the complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS. The relative orientation between A35 and U36 of tRNAMetCAU bound on A. aeolicus Met-tRNA synthetase (Protein Data Bank ID: 2CSX) [27] is appropriate to be accepted by the hydrophobic pocket and the local structure that are commonly found in the three ArgRSs. Thus, E. coli ArgRS is expected to have a similar hydrophobic pocket and local structure, which may successfully accept C35 and G36 of the mutated tRNAMetCCG in the formation of Arg-tRNAMetCCG on E. coli ArgRS [29]. On the other hand, in tRNAMetCAU bound on A. aeolicus Met-tRNA synthetase, the conformation of the anticodon loop of C32­U33­C34­A35­U36­A37­ A38 of tRNAMetCAU is largely different from that of C32­U33­C34­C35­U36­A37­A38 of tRNAArgCCU bound on P. horikoshii ArgRS. It is worth noting that the base of C32 is stacked on a C31ÆG39 base pair in tRNAMetCAU, but the base of A37 is stacked on a C31ÆG39 base pair in the case of the observed complex of P. horikoshii ArgRS and tRNAArgCCU which caught its D-loop on the N-terminal domain of the ArgRS. The region from Asp456 to Glu466 in the superim° posed T. thermophilus ArgRS is not within 2.5 A of the corresponding region of S17, H18 and the X-loop from Ile490 to Glu500 in P. horikoshii ArgRS, whereas the C-terminal side from Gly467 in the X-loop in ° T. thermophilus ArgRS is within 1 A of that in P. horikoshii ArgRS (Fig. 6). The structural difference of this region is due to difference of crystallization conditions. It was reported that structural difference in this region was observed in S. cerevisiae ArgRS proteins crystallized under different crystallization conditions [12,30,31]. The aminoacylation reaction for tRNAArgCCU on wild-type ArgRS and ArgRS lacking the N-terminal domain (DN ArgRS) In order to clarify whether or not the binding of the D-loop of tRNAArgCCU to the N-terminal domain contributes to the activation effect of tRNA on tRNAassisted Arg-AMP formation reaction or the aminoacylation reaction, we constructed P. horikoshii ArgRS (residues 92­629; DN ArgRS) lacking the core region of the N-terminal domain from residue 1 to residue 91 in order to completely eliminate interactions between the N-terminal domain and the D-loop of tRNAArg, and measured the kinetic parameters of the amino-

acylation reaction for wild-type ArgRS and DN ArgRS. For wild-type ArgRS and DN ArgRS, the Km values for tRNAArgCCU were 2.6 lm and 3.8 lm in 100 mm Hepes / NaOH buffer (pH 7.5), respectively, and the measured ratio of the V-value of DN ArgRS to that of wild-type ArgRS was [(8 ± 2) · 10)2]. This indicates that the fixing of the D-loop of tRNAArg with the N-terminal domain makes a minor contribution to the aminoacylation reaction, but is not essential, and that DN ArgRS facilitates the aminoacylation reaction of tRNAArgCCU well enough. In particular, the proper acceptance of C35 and U36 of tRNAArgCCU on the plausible accepting structures may be predominantly contributory to the aminoacylation reaction of tRNAArgCCU on P. horikoshii ArgRS. Model building Newly obtained structural information about the position of ATP analog (ANP) in the ternary complexes of P. horikoshii ArgRS was successfully used for the modeling of Arg, ATP and A76 of tRNA on P. horikoshii ArgRS for the tRNA-assisted ATP­PPi exchange reaction. In P. horikoshii ArgRS, the positions of the adenosine and a-phosphate moieties of ATP bound thereon were assumed to be equivalent to those of ANP observed. The Arg-binding region in the complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, Arg and tRNAArg corresponds to the region surrounded by the S5 strand, the HIGH

loop, the H13 helix, the S14­H14 turn and the H14 helix in the Rossmann fold domain in P. horikoshii ArgRS. Referring to the distances between the a-NH2 group of Arg and the main chain C@O of Ser151 and O of the side chain of Asn153, and the distances between the guanidinium moiety and the side chains of Glu148 and Asp351 in S. cerevisiae ArgRS, we predicted the possible site for Arg in P. horikoshii ArgRS. In the predicted site, the distances between the a-NH2 group of Arg and the main chain C@O of Ser127 and ° O of the side chain of Asn129 are set at 3.15 A and ° , and the distances between the guanidinium 3.04 A moiety and the side chain of Glu124 (S5) and Asp335 ° ° (H13) are set at 4.33 A and 3.66 A. Its carboxyl group is located at the proper position relative to Pa of ANP (ATP analog). In the ternary complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, the base of A76 is stacked on the side chain of Tyr347 on the helix corresponding to H13 in P. horikoshii ArgRS, whereas in P. horikoshii ArgRS, the H13 helix deviates largely from that of S. cerevisiae ArgRS (Fig. 3A), and the conformation of the side chain of the corresponding Tyr331 is similar to that in the binary complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS and tRNAArg, the 3¢-terminal CCA of which is not visible in the electron density map. When A76 was moved ° within 2.5 A of the position of S. cerevisiae tRNAArg bound to S. cerevisiae ArgRS superimposed on P. horikoshii ArgRS, the 2¢-OH group of the ribose moiety was located in close proximity to the carboxyl group of the Arg. The Mg2+ was coordinated to Pb@O and ° Pc@O of ATP, with a distance of 2.1 A. Figure 7A shows a model of Arg, ATP coordinated by Mg2+ and A76 of tRNAArg assisting the Arg-AMP formation reaction. A model of NH2OH, enzymatically synthesized Arg-AMP and A76 of tRNAArg in the ArgNHOH formation reaction in the presence of tRNAArg is shown in Fig. 7B. In the case of modeling the deacylation reaction of Arg-tRNAArg, coordinations of NH2­Ca­C and Cb of the Arg moiety of Arg-tRNAArg were assumed to be essentially identical to those of the Arg predicted above, and the Arg moiety in the cyclic form was fitted in the space that is provided by the rearrangement of the side chain of Gln387 (Fig. 7C). We built a model for the Glu-dependent ATP­PPi exchange reaction at pH 6.0 in the absence of tRNAGlu on the basis of the crystal structure of T. thermophilus GluRS (Protein Data Bank IDs: 1N77, 1N78, and 2CV0) [32]. Coordinations of NH2­Ca­C and Cb of the Glu moiety of the intermediate of formed Glu-AMP were assumed to be identical to those of the observed Glu bound on GluRS (Fig. 7D).

Discussion
ATP­PPi exchange reaction and pyrophosphorolysis reaction at low pH In the cases of ArgRS from E. coli, B. stearothermophilus, N. crassa, and S. cerevisiae [1­5], GlnRS from E. coli W, S. cerevisiae, and porcine liver [7,8], and GluRS from E. coli K12 [9,10], the tRNA-assisted ATP­PPi exchange reaction has been observed, but no tRNA-independent ATP­PPi exchange reaction has ever been observed. In the cases of GluRS from E. coli W, S. cerevisiae, porcine liver, and rat liver, the tRNA-independent ATP­PPi exchange reaction was observed at much higher concentrations of Glu, whereas the tRNA-assisted ATP­PPi exchange reaction was observed at lower concentrations of Glu. For instance, the Km value for Glu measured in the tRNAassisted ATP­PPi exchange reaction decreases significantly by 102)103-fold in comparison with that in the tRNA-independent ATP­PPi exchange reaction (the Km values for Glu are 0.4 m in the absence of tRNA and 6.6 · 10)4 m in the presence of tRNA at pH 7.7 for E. coli W, 0.2 m and 7 · 10)3 m at pH 7.7 for S. cerevisiae, 0.4 m and 4 · 10)3 m at pH 7.7 for
4772

porcine liver, and 0.2 m and 6.7 · 10)4 at pH 7.6 for rat liver, respectively [7,8,33]). In the absence of tRNA, any Arg-AMP and Gln-AMP are not detectable as intermediates formed by ArgRS and GlnRS, respectively [4,34­36]. As phosphodiesterase-treated tRNA and mutated tRNA containing C instead of A at the 3¢-end eliminate catalytic activity for the ATP­PPi exchange reaction on ArgRS [3], the ATP­PPi exchange reaction on ArgRS requires A at the 3¢-end of tRNA. In the presence of the tRNA treated with periodate, which oxidizes the 2¢-OH and 3¢-OH groups of the ribose of A at the 3¢-end to convert them into dialdehyde groups, the ArgRS, GlnRS and GluRS enzymes were incapable of catalyzing the ATP­PPi exchange reaction [1,4,5,7,33]. These facts indicate that the hydroxyl group of the ribose of the 3¢-terminal A76 of tRNA is essential for the ATP­PPi exchange reaction on ArgRS, GlnRS, and GluRS. The cognate tRNA is also necessary for the ArgRScatalyzed pyrophosphorolysis of chemically synthesized Arg-AMP in the presence of PPi and Mg2+ [6]. Furthermore, the pyrophosphorolysis of chemically synthesized Arg-AMP and the ATP­PPi exchange reaction catalyzed by ArgRS in the presence of tRNA have pH optima of 6.2 and 6.5, respectively. The presence of PPi

at high concentrations was reported to inhibit the ArgRS-catalyzed formation reaction of Arg-tRNA at pH 7.0, and more strongly at pH 6.4 [3,4,6]. At low pH, the 2¢-OH group of the ribose moiety of A76 of the cognate tRNA assists the ATP­PPi exchange reactions on ArgRS, GlnRS, and GluRS. In the pyrophosphorolysis reaction of synthetic Arg-AMP at low pH in the presence of PPi and Mg2+, which is the reverse reaction to the formation of Arg-AMP, the ribose moiety of A76 is also required. The fact that, in GluRS, the Km value of Glu for the ATP­PPi exchange reaction decreases substantially in the presence of tRNA as compared with that in the absence of tRNA [7,8,33] indicates that the 2¢-OH group of tRNA interacts with Glu directly. As the 2¢-OH group of tRNA is close to the a-carboxyl group of Glu, an interaction between the 2¢-OH group and the a-carboxyl group occurs, which is an interaction with the O of the a-carboxyl group rather than the C. On the other hand, the interaction with C results in the aminoacylation reaction. It is expected that the direct interaction between the the 2¢-OH group of tRNA and the a-carboxyl group of Arg / Gln will also take place in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction on ArgRS and GlnRS. The interaction between the 2¢-OH group and the O of the a-carboxyl group of Arg is thought to accelerate the pyrophosphorolysis reaction on ArgRS. In a ternary complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, tRNAArgICG, and Arg (Protein Data Bank ID: 1F7V) [12], the O of the 2¢-OH group in the 3¢-end A76 of ° ° ° tRNAArgICG is 3.18 A, 3.71 A and 3.57 A distant from the C, O1, and O2 (the O contacting Pa of ATP is defined as O1 and the other as O2), respectively, of the a-carboxyl group of Arg. The movement of O2 by a rotation of 45° around the Ca­C ° bond causes a decreased distance of 2.77 A between O2 and the O of the 2¢-OH group, which is a suitable distance for a hydrogen bond to form between them, whereas the C is not moved by this rotation. Such a slight rotation induces the formation of a hydrogen bond between O2 and the 2¢-OH group of the 3¢-end ribose moiety of tRNA, and thereby the anionic form of the C)O1 is converted into the C@O1 form. Hence, the intermolecular rearrangement reaction for Arg-AMP formation is considered to take place through a pathway such as that shown in Fig. 8. The O1 orbital of the double bond C@O1 changes initially from an sp2 to an sp3 hybrid orbital, and a bond is formed between O1 and Pa of ATP through formation of the trigonal bipyramid coordination around Pa. At the same time, the H­O2 bond of H­O2­C of the a-carboxyl group of Arg is transferred to the O2­C bond to form the double bond

The rotation of the a-carboxyl group around Ca­C induces the formation of a hydrogen bond between the 2¢-OH group of the ribose of A76 and O2H of the a-carboxyl group of Arg. Arrows indicate the sequential transfer of the bond in the intermediate.

O2@C, and a proton is transferred to a water molecule. Successively, the C@O1 bond is transferred to the O1­Pa bond, the Pa­O bond is transferred to the O­Pb bond, and thereby the O­Pb bond is converted into O@Pb. Finally, PPi is released in the form of Mg-PPi. As O1 of the amino acid binds to Pa, and PPi is released from Pa on the reverse side, this reaction of Arg-AMP formation is an SN2 reaction. The modeling of Arg, ATP and A76 of tRNA on P. horikoshii ArgRS for the Arg-AMP formation reaction at low pH indicates that when the straight side chain of an Arg molecule is inserted into the hydrophobic pocket as in the Arg molecule bound to S. cerevisiae ArgRS, its carboxyl group can locate in close proximity to Pa of ATP (Fig. 7A). The a-carboxyl group of the Arg molecule can assume such a conformation that O2 forms a hydrogen bond with the 2¢-OH group of the ribose moiety of A76 of tRNAArg by rotation around Ca­C. When Pa of ATP gains access to O1 of C@O1 of the a-carboxyl group of Arg, and two oxygen atoms of Pb and Pc are coordinated by Mg2+ on two parallel P@O bonds rather than P­O), as observed in the acetylacetonato [CH3C(@O)­ C)H­C(@O)CH3] complex, the intermolecular rearrangement reaction occurs. In the pyrophosphorolysis reaction of synthetic ArgAMP in the presence of PPi and Mg2+, the 2¢-OH group of tRNAArg can never be placed in the proper

configuration for the aminoacylation reaction without a conformational rearrangement, but should be in a much more preferable configuration to form a hydrogen bond with C@O2 of the Ca­(C@O2)­O1­Pa moiety. Even though the pyrophosphorolysis reaction is also an SN2 reaction, the hydrogen bond between the 2¢-OH group of tRNA and C@O2 is also required for the pyrophosphorolysis reaction. The cleavage of the bond between CO1 and Pa of Arg-AMP is accelerated by this hydrogen bond. The formation of this hydrogen bond leads to a double bond between C and O1, and the intermolecular rearrangement reaction proceeds in the reverse direction of the Arg-AMP formation reaction shown in Fig. 8. Indeed, the amount of neutral PPi, in which the lone pairs of double bonds of Pb@O and Pc@O are coordinated by Mg2+, increases at lower pH in the hydrophobic circumstance of the reaction region of ArgRS. PPi is involved in the pyrophosphorolysis reaction in the form of Mg-PPi. This fact explains why the pyrophosphorolysis reaction of synthetic Arg-AMP has an optimum at pH 6.2 in the presence of tRNA and its optimum pH is a little lower than that for the ATP­PPi exchange reaction [6]. It was reported that, in the presence of tRNAArg, in parallel with the Arg-tRNA formation reaction on ArgRS, addition of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) gives rise to increased hydrolysis of ATP at pH 8.0, whereas in the absence of tRNAArg, addition of NH2OH induces no increase in the hydrolysis of ATP [3]. After PPi is released, the 2¢-OH group of the ribose moiety of tRNA forms a hydrogen bond with O2 of C@O2 of Arg-AMP (Fig. 7B), and the sp2 hybrid orbital on the C therefore changes to an sp3 hybrid orbital. The C with an sp3 hybrid orbital has the ability to react with NH2OH. Therefore, by an SN2 reaction, Arg-NHOH is formed and AMP is released. The fact that ArgAMP reacts with NH2OH rather than with tRNA shows that, in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction, tRNA stays preferentially in the position suitable for the formation of a hydrogen bond with O2 of C@O2. If, in the ternary complex of S. cerevisiae ArgRS, tRNA, and Arg, the carboxyl group of the Arg was rotated by 45° around Ca­C, its O2 would come into ° close proximity, with a distance of 2.77 A, to the O of the 2¢-OH group of A76. As, in the ternary complex of GlnRS, tRNA and Gln-AMP analog (5¢-O-[N-(l-glutaminyl)sulfamonyl]adenosine) [37], the 2¢-OH group ° of the 3¢-end ribose moiety of tRNAGln is 3.00 A and ° 3.60 A distant from the C and O2, respectively, of the carbonyl group of Ca­(C@O2)­NH­ in the Gln-AMP analog. The Gln can assume such a conformation that O2H of the carboxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the 2¢-OH group of A76 by the rotation of the
4774

carboxyl group and a little movement. The observation that the ATP­PPi exchange reaction requires tRNA at low pH in ArgRS, GlnRS and GluRS is explained by the mechanism that the formation of the hydrogen bond between O2 of the carboxyl group of the cognate amino acid and the 2¢-OH group of the ribose moiety of A76 maintains the appropriate orientation of the carboxyl group of the amino acid for Pa. On GluRS, in the absence of tRNA, the Km value of Glu in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction increases to up to 102)103-fold that in the presence of tRNA at a pH of 7.7 or 7.6 [7,8,33]. In the absence of tRNA, the activity increases up to pH 8.0 as pH increases, and decreases when the pH reaches over 8.0, whereas in the presence of tRNA, the activity decreases when the pH reaches over 6.2 [33]. The reported large difference in the Km value is related to a difference in the form of the bound Glu. In the presence of tRNA, the a-carboxyl group of the Glu interacts with the 2¢-OH group of the ribose moiety of tRNA, and the side chain assumes the straight form, with the alkyl group in the all-trans form, allowing the ribose moiety to approach. In the case of the ATP­PPi exchange reaction in the absence of tRNA, the most likely candidate for the form of the Glu is a rotational isomer in the cyclic form, which contains a cis-alkyl group. In the cyclic form, instead of the 2¢-OH group of tRNA, the c-carboxyl group of the side chain can form a hydrogen bond with the a-carboxyl group in the C­Oc)­H­O2 form (Fig. 7D), which results in preferential rotation of the carboxyl group around Ca­C. Such rotational isomerization of Asp and Glu is used in the phenomena that amide bond is sometimes transferred from the a-carboxyl of an Asp or Glu to the side chain b-carboxyl or c-carboxyl under hydrophobic conditions [38]. In GlnRS, the ATP­PPi exchange reaction has not been yet observed in the absence of tRNA, even in the presence of a high concentration of Gln. This is explained by the fact that, even if Gln assumed a cyclic form, no hydrogen bond could be formed between the side chain and the a-carboxyl group. Deacylation reaction at high pH The deacylation reaction consists of the following two steps: the first step is the formation of Arg-AMP from Arg-tRNA and AMP; the second step is the formation of Arg and ATP from Arg-AMP and PPi through a pyrophosphorolysis reaction. Because the first step is an SN2 reaction, in the reaction intermediate, C of the Ca­(C@O)­O moiety of Arg-tRNA has an sp3 hybrid orbital. The conversion from an sp2 to an sp3 hybrid orbital requires the transfer of a proton to C@O or

Fig. 9. Reaction scheme of Arg transfer from Arg-tRNA to AMP in the deacylation reaction at pH 8.0. A proton of NeH of ­Ne+H@C­(NH2)2 of the Arg moiety with the cyclic configuration of Arg-tRNA is transferred to C@O of the ester bond of Arg-tRNA. The adenosine moiety of AMP is omitted.

the formation of a hydrogen bond. At pH 8, the finding that, as no residue of the protein can donate a proton in the pyrophosphorolysis reaction, even though, at low pH, the 2¢-OH group of tRNA is used, indicates that there is, of course, no residue to donate a proton in the first step at high pH. The guanidinium group of Arg also forms the rotational isomer in a quite similar manner to the side chain of Glu. The transfer of a proton from NeH of ­Ne+H@C­(NH2)2 to the C@O of the ester bond of Arg-tRNA converts the sp2 hybrid orbital of the C to an sp3 hybrid orbital. A bond is then formed between this C and the O of Pa@O, and the intermolecular rearrangement reaction occurs as shown in Fig. 9. The Arg moiety in the cyclic form can, indeed, occupy the active site on ArgRS by a change in the torsional angles of the side chain of Gln387 (Fig. 7C). Arg-tRNA with such a rotational isomer is decomposed by the deacylation reaction. The deacylation reaction of Arg-tRNA occurs slowly at pH 7.2, and this reaction becomes much slower as the pH decreases. This pH dependence shows that, at the lower pH, a lower reaction rate is observed for the first step, whereas a higher reaction rate is observed for the pyrophosphorolysis reaction of Arg-AMP. It has been observed that, under conditions of excess enzyme, in the presence of AMP but in the absence of PPi at pH 6.0, the decrease in the concentration of Arg-tRNA takes place with a first-order rate constant, but such a reaction at pH 6.0 leaves 43% of the Arg-tRNA unreacted [11]. From this result, the ratio of Arg-tRNA without the cyclic form of the Arg moiety and with the cyclic form is estimated to be 43 : 57 at pH 6.0. The reaction at such a high pH of 7.2 was reported to have a much higher rate, so that a considerable amount of Arg-tRNA was not left unreacted. The ratio of Arg-tRNA with the cyclic form of the Arg moiety to total Arg-tRNA is strongly dependent on pH. The Arg-AMP formed from Arg-tRNA with the cyclic form of the Arg moiety maintains a suitable

conformation for the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. The intramolecular hydrogen bond, instead of tRNA, accelerates the pyrophosphorolysis step of this deacylation reaction. The reported results of the deacylation reaction indicate that ArgRS has a binding affinity for Arg-tRNA with the cyclic form of the Arg moiety that is comparable to that for Arg-tRNA without the cyclic form. Furthermore, as suggested above, ArgRS has a binding affinity for Arg-AMP with the cyclic form of the Arg moiety that is comparable to that for Arg-AMP without the cyclic form. The rate of transfer of the Arg moiety from the chemically synthesized Arg-AMP to tRNA has an optimum at pH 8.1 [6]. If the guanidium moiety of Arg-AMP can donate a proton from NeH of the cyclic form instead of the 2¢-OH group of tRNA to C@O of the Ca­(C@O)­O­Pa moiety of Arg-AMP, the 2¢-OH group of tRNA becomes free. The acceptance of a proton by the ­(C@O)­O­ moiety changes the C orbital from an sp2 hybrid orbital to an sp3 hybrid orbital, and the bond is formed between this C and the 2¢-OH group of tRNA. As Arg-AMP has the ionic guanidinium group and the neutral amino group at pH 8, the rate of transfer from Arg-AMP to tRNA has an optimum at pH 8.1. In the ATP­PPi exchange reaction at low pH, the C of the a-carboxyl group of the Arg assumes an sp2 configuration, whereas in the transfer reaction of the Arg moiety, the 2¢-OH group of tRNA forms a bond with the C with an sp3 hybrid orbital of Arg-AMP, through an SN2 reaction at high pH. From the point of view of the stereo structural understanding in the reaction pathway of the transfer of the Arg moiety from the enzymatically synthesized Arg-AMP to tRNA, the facts that the Km values for the cognate amino acids in the aminoacylation reaction on ArgRS, GlnRS and GluRS are not the same as but are less than that in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction should be noted (for S. cerevisiae ArgRS, the Km values for Arg

in the aminoacylation reaction at pH 7.5 and in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction at pH 7.0 are 1.5 lm and 2.5 lm, respectively [39]. For B. stearothermophilus ArgRS, those for Arg at pH 8.0 are 5.7 lm and 7.4 lm, respectively [40], and for E. coli K12 ArgRS, those in the aminoacylation reaction at pH 7.4 and in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction at pH 7.2 are 12 lm and 110 lm, respectively [41]. For E. coli W GluRS and GlnRS, the Km values for Glu and for Gln in the aminoacylation reaction at pH 7.7 are 1.2 · 10)4 m and 1.8 · 10)4 m, and those in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction in the presence of cognate tRNA are 6.6 · 10)4 m and 8.0 · 10)4 m, respectively [7]. For rat liver GluRS, the Km values for Glu in the aminoacylation reaction and in the ATP­PPi exchange reaction at pH 6.8 are 1.3 · 10)4 m and 6.7 · 10)4 m, respectively [33]. The newly determined structure of the ATP analog (ANP) bound on P. horikoshii ArgRS has been used to construct a model of the tRNA-assisted ATP­PPi exchange reaction and a model of the tRNA-assisted pyrophosphorolysis reaction of Arg-AMP at low pH. Modeling of the ArgRS-catalyzed deacylation of ArgtRNA at high pH has also been performed on the basis of the common binding site of ATP and AMP on P. horikoshii ArgRS. The newly determined structure of the tRNAArgCCU bound on P. horikoshii ArgRS provides further information on the plausible accepting structures for C35 and U36 of tRNAArgCCU. In addition, the comparison of the reactivities of wildtype ArgRS and ArgRS lacking the N-terminal domain (DN ArgRS) provides good evidence that the proper acceptance of C35 and U36 of tRNAArgCCU on the plausible accepting structures may be predominantly contributory to the aminoacylation reaction of tRNAArgCCU on P. horikoshii ArgRS.

constructed plasmid (pET28c / DN ArgRS) was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)codon+, and the crude protein was purified in the same way as the wild-type protein. In P. horikoshii, codon usages for AGA and AGG codons are 19 and 34, respectively, and they amount to 98% among six codons for Arg. The D-loops of isoacceptor tRNAUCU and tRNACCU contain nine (AGCAGGAC20aA) and 10 nucleotides (AGCCA17aGGAC20aA), respectively. The P. horikoshii tRNAArgCCU gene (5¢-GGACCGGTAG CCTAGCCA17aGGAC20aAGGGCGGCGGCCTCCTAAG CCGCAGGTCCGGGGTTCAAATCCCCGCCGGTCCG CCA-3¢) was cloned with the T7 promoter into the vector pUC119. In vitro transcription of the template DNA was carried out with T7 RNA polymerase, and the crude transcript was charged on a Resource Q column. Elution with 20 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm MgCl2 under a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 2 m gave a pure tRNAArg transcript, which was precipitated by addition of ethanol.

Aminoacylation reaction
The aminoacylation reaction of tRNA was measured at 65 °C in 100 mm Hepes / NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 30 mm KCl, 0.1 lgÆmL)1 BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 50 lm l-[14C]Arg (100 lCiÆmL)1 Moravek, Lane Brea, CA, USA), 0.2 lm wild-type ArgRS or 2 lm DN ArgRS, and various concentrations of tRNAArgCCU (0.5­ 16 lm). Aliquots of 9 lL at varying time intervals were quenched with 5 lL of 1% trichloroacetic acid and spotted onto Whatman 3 MM disks. Radioactivity was quantified in a scintillation counter. The kinetic constants were derived from a Lineweaver plot.

Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination
A solution of 10 mm Tris / HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 5­6 mgÆmL)1 tRNAArg transcript was heated at 80 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Then, 10 mm Hepes / NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 2 mgÆmL)1 ArgRS was added, so that the ArgRS / tRNAArg molar ratio was 1 : 1.1. The resulting mixture was heated at 80 °C for 5 min, and slowly cooled to room temperature. In the case of the ternary complex, ANP tetralithium salt hydrate (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. Crystals of the complexes were grown at 20 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. A 2 lL drop of the above solution containing ArgRS and tRNAArg and the reservoir solution (1 lL each) was equilibrated with reservoir containing 30% poly(ethylene glycol) 4000, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, and 100 mm Tris / HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Thin, plate-like crystals with dimension of 0.4 · 0.07 · < 0.05 mm were obtained in 3­7 days.

Experimental procedures
Gene expression and purification
The gene encoding ArgRS was isolated from the genome of P. horikoshii by PCR amplification, and inserted into the TOPO vector (Invitrogen); TOPO / ArgRS was then ligated with pET28c. E. coli BL21(DE3)codon+ cells were transformed with plasmid pET28c / ArgRS, and the crude protein was purified on an Ni2+­nitrilotriacetic acid superflow ¨ column and further purified with an AKTA purifier FPLC system through Resource Q (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St Giles, UK), Hitrap heparin (GE Healthcare) and hydroxyapatite (BioScale, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) columns. The gene encoding the protein lacking the N-terminal side from the 91st residue (DN ArgRS) was amplified by PCR using plasmid pET28c / ArgRS as template. A

The intensity data were collected at 100 K on beamline BL41 at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) and beamline AR-NM12 at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). The dataset was processed with the hkl2000 suite [42]. The structure of a protein was solved by the molecular replacement method with the molrep program in ccp4 [43] by using T. thermophilus ArgRS (Protein Data Bank ID: 1IQ0) as a search model. As for the tRNAArg molecule, tRNAArgICG in the S. cerevisiae ArgRS­tRNAArgICG complex (Protein Data Bank ID: 1F7V) was used as an initial model. Refinements of this structure gave an R-factor of about 40%, but the low electron density maps in the N-terminal domain and tRNA region revealed large deviations of this domain of P. horikoshii ArgRS from T. thermophilus ArgRS and S. cerevisiae ArgRS, a large conformational change of the anticodon loop, the D-loop, and the T-loop, and deviation of the inclination of base planes of the acceptor stem and the anticodon-binding stem of tRNAArgCCU from S. cerevisiae tRNAArgICG. The repeats of the model building and refinements using the o program [44] and the cns program [45] gave a better electron density map, and an ANP molecule was finally identified from the map. Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final model for the tertiary and binary complexes has good stereochemistry, with 92.3% and 91.1% of residues, respectively, in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot [46]. molscript [47] and raster3d [48] were used for drawing Figs 1 and 3­7, and bobscript also [49] for Fig. 4.
