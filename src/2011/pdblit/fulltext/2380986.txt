The structure of cc-lytic protease, a serine protease produced by the bacterium Lysobacter enzymogenes, has been refined at 1.7 A resolution. The conventional R-factor is 0.131 for the 14,996 reflections between 8 and 1.7 A resolution with I>2a(I). The model consists of 1391 protein atoms, two sulfate ions and 156 water molecules. The overall root-meansquare error is estimated to be about 0.14 A. The refined structure was compared with homologous enzymes a-chymotrypsin and Streptomyces griseus protease A and B. A new sequence numbering was derived based on the alignment of these structures. The comparison showed that the greatest structural homology is around the active site residues Aspl02, His57 and Ser195, and that basic folding pathways are maintained despite chemical changes in the hydrophobic cores. The hydrogen bonds in the structure were tabulated and the distances and angles of interaction are similar to those found in small molecules. The analysis also revealed the presence of close intraresidue interactions. There hydrogen bonds. Most intermolecular interactions are only a few direct intermolecular involve bridging solvent molecules. The structural importance of hydrogen bonds involving the side-chain of Asx residues is discussed. All the negatively charged groups have a counterion nearby, while the excess positively charged groups are exposed to the solvent. One of the sulfate ions is located near the active sit,e, whereas the other is close to the N terminus. Of the 156 water molecules, only seven are not involved in a hydrogen bond. Six of these have polar groups nearby, while the remaining one is in very weak density. There are nine internal water molecules, consisting of two monomers, two dimers and one trimer. No significant second shell of solvent is observed.

1. Introduction
cc-Lytic protease (EC 3.4.21.-) is a bacterial serine protease isolated from the extracellular filtrate produced by the soil micro-organism Lysobacter enzymogenes (Christensen & Cook, 1978; ATCC 29487, formerly known as Myxobacter 495). The enzyme has an elastase-like primary specificity, cleaving oligopeptide substrates on the carbonyl side of amino acids with short aliphatic side-chains (Whitaker et al., 1965; Kaplan & Whitaker, 1969; Kaplan et al., 1970). Kinetic studies with synthetic peptides have shown that the substrate binding interactions extend over at least six subsites (Bauer et al., 1981). t Present address: Department of Biochemistry,

Various nuclear magnetic resonance studies, designed to probe the protonation state of the catalytic triad (AsplO2, His57, Ser195), have been done with a-lytic protease (see the review by Steitz & Shulman, 1982). The enzyme is an ideal subject for such studies because the active site histidine is unique in the protein. Comparison of the three-dimensional structure of a-lytic protease at 2.8 A resolution (Brayer et al., 1979) with that of elastase (Sawyer et al., 1978) showed that, in spite of relatively weak sequence homology (James et al., 1978), the enzymes display extensive tertiary structural homology. Large
insertions and deletions in the sequence of a-lytic

protease relative to the pancreatic enzymes made the tertiary structural predictions from comparitive model-building exceedingly difficult (McLachlan & Shotton, 1971; Delbaere et al., 1979). a-Lytic protease is much more homologous to the bacterial serine proteases from Streptomyces griseus, SGPA

and SGPBt (James et al., 1978). The sequence identity with these enzymes is 40% and 43%, respectively, and the structural equivalences are approximately 80%. In this paper, we have aligned the sequences of the three bacterial enzymes a-lytic protease, SGPA and SGPB with that of a-chymotrypsin. This alignment is based on the refined highresolution structures of all four molecules and differs in detail in several places from the previous alignment based only on unrefined a-carbon atom co-ordinates (James et al., 1978). The amino acid numbering scheme used herein for a-lytic protease is based on this new alignment. This paper describes the results of the crystallographic refinement of a-lytic protease at 1.7 ir resolution. The refinement of the structure allows for a detailed examination of the hydrogen bonding and the solvent structure. The refined parameters of a-lytic protease have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).

2. Experimental Procedures
(a) Crystallization and data collection

The 2.8 a resolution multi-isomorphous structure for cc-lytic protease (Brayer et aE., 1979) was refined using the restrained parameter least-squares program of Hendrickson & Konnert (1980). The progress of the refinement was slow, as seen in the plot of the R-factor? uerwus refinement cycle (Fig. 1). About every 10 cycles of refinement, the current model was displayed with a superimposed electron density map that had been computed with coefficients 21F,I - IF,I, act, on the MMS-X graphics system (Barry et al., 1976) using the program M3 written by Colin Broughton of this laboratory (Sielecki et al., 1982). Manual adjustments were made to the model as indicated by the electron density. Table 2 gives some of the details of the refinement progress at various stages. At cycle 91, the data set, was replaced by a new one (Table 1, crystal 2) with the hope that better data might speed the refinement. However, no significant improvement in the rate of refinement was observed. Solvent molecules were included in the model starting at cycle 33. Difference electron density maps with coefficients IF,1 -IF,/, CI,, were used to locate possible

A single crystal grown from 1.3 M-Li,SO, (pH 7.2: Brayer et d., 1979) was used to collect a complete 1.8 A resolution data set on which much of the refinement was
based. This data set was replaced at a later stage in the

solvent positions. Peaks in the electron density that were
in positions with hydrogen-bonding potential were interpreted as water molecules and were allowed to refine as neutral oxygen atoms with individual temperature factors B(A') and occupancy. The indicated shifts on B values and occupancies were applied in alternate cycles.

(2) Calculate a difference map and select as solvent positions all peaks above a relatively high cutoff level. A high cutoff is necessary because of the larger errors in the phases at this point.

It is important, at each iteration, to keep the cutoff as a level high enough that noise is not misinterpreted solvent atom. In this context, additional criteria that the total peak size be a certain level and that the peak be relatively convex by visual inspection were imposed. In the last difference map, a cutoff level of 0.22e/A3 and a minimum peak size of 0.21 e/peak were used. The error of the map was estimated to be 0.05 e/A3 (Blundell & Johnson, 1976). (d) Estimation
of errors

Figure 1. A plot of the R-factor at each cycle of refinement. Point a indicates the first cycle using the new data from crystal 2 (Table 1). All solvent molecules in the model were deleted. Point b indicates the first cycle of the solvent position redetermination (see Experimental Procedures, section c)). Solvent molecules were deleted at this point as well.

Solvent molecules that refined to very high temperature factors or very low occupancy values were eliminated. When the data set was changed at cycle 91, all the solvents were deleted and a new difference map was calculated. The map showed that many of the solvents were in the same positions in the two crystals. In addition to these water molecules, 2 sulfate ions have been included in the model. These were refined with just individual B factors.
(c) Redetermination of solvent positions

The analysis of errors in a structure refined by a restrained least-squares procedure is not straightforward. The reader is referred to Read et al. (1983) for a full discussion. The co-ordinate errors were estimated using 3 different methods. The method of Luzzati (1952) estimates the error from the variation of the R-factor with resolution. From such a plot we estimate the overall root-meansquare error for the refined a-lytic protease structure as 0.14 A. However, only an overall error estimate is obtained from this method. An estimate of the errors in individual atomic positions may be calculated from the formula given by Cruickshank (1949, 1954, 1967). The equat,ion for a trigonal space group is similar to that for a monoclinic space group and is given by:
u,i = c

At cycle 124 of the refinement, it was felt that there were problems with the procedure used to select solvent positions. The requirement that a potential solvent atom be in a hydrogen-bonding position relative to polar protein atoms biases the resulting solvent structure. To overcome this problem, the solvent positions were redet'ermined using a new procedure as follows. (1) Remove all solvents and allow the protein atoms to refine for a few cycles (typically 4).

where c is the axial length, foi is the atomic scattering factor, and m = 2 or 1 depending on whether the reflection is centric or not. The radial error is given by .. m-i = J 3 (TZ, The r.m.s. error for all t,he atoms in the protein calculated using the Cruickshank formula is 0.10 A. The third way to estimate positional errors is to compare the co-ordinates of the refined structure with

those obtained by refining without restraints (Chambers & Stroud, 1979). Four cycles of unrestrained refinement converged with an R-factor of 0.117. The r.m.s. difference between the co-ordinates of the restrained and unrestrained structures as a function of the B factor for each atom type is shown in Fig. 2. The very large deviations of nitrogen atoms with large B-factors (Fig. 2(b)) correspond to disordered arginine side-chains. The overall r.m.s. difference is 0.12 A for all the atoms of the protein. The errors predicted by the Cruickshank formula are on these plots and show reasonable superimposed agreement between 2 methods. These plots can be used to obtain an estimate of the error as a function of B. The variation of B along the polypeptide chain is given in Fig. 3. (e) Structure equivalence and sequence alignment The refined structures of SGPA at 1.5 A resolution (Sielecki et al., 1979; Sielecki $ James, 1981), SGPB at 1.7 A resolution (Sawyer et al., unpublished results), cc-chymotrypsin at 1.8 A resolution (the Lw-chymotrypsin structure is that from the crystals of its complex with the third domain of the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor, Read, Fujinaga, Sielecki, Ardelt, Laskowski & James, unpublished results) and a-lytic protease were used. We used the program of W. Bennett that is based on the methodology of Rossmann & Argos (1975) to determine the structural equivalence of these 4 enzymes. Those pairs of a-carbon atoms that differed in position by less than 1.9 A were considered structurally equivalent in the 2 enzymes being compared. For the comparison of the 3 bacterial enzymes with bovine pancreatic a-chymotrypsin, we relaxed this criterion to 3.0 a.

The refinement procedure has resulted in a structure with good geometry and a low R-factor. The final model consists of 1391 protein atoms, two sulfate ions and 156 water molecules. The R-factor is 0.131 for the 14,996 reflections between 8 A and 1.7 A resolution that satisfy the criterion I 2 2a(I). The quality of the structure can be judged from summarize the the data in Table 3, which deviations from ideal geometry. Another indication of the quality can be seen in the 4-$ plot (Ramakrishnan $ Ramachandran, 1965) shown in Figure 4. There are only five non-glycyl residues (Ala39, Asn60, Pro95 Thr54 and Prol20) whose $J, + values fall outside the acceptable regions. The first three are located in turns, while the remaining residues, Thr54 and Prol20, are located very close to the boundaries of the acceptable regions on the CJ-IJ plot. Proline 95 with 4, + values (--81", - 155") is in a cis conformation. The corresponding prolyl residues in SGPA and SGPB are also in cis conformations (Brayer et al., 1978). The general folding of the polypeptide chain is as described in 2.8 A resolution study (Brayer et al., 1979):The major changes to the structure are due to side-chain reorientation and flipping of four peptide bonds.

refined structure is 0.88 A for the main-chain atoms and 1.60 A for the side-chain atoms. These values include average shifts in x, y, z of 0.54, 0.06, 0.17 A for the main-chain atoms and 0.49, O-02, 0.12 A for the side-chain atoms. Figure 5(a) shows the complete molecule, while Figure 5(b) shows the main-chain atoms with the hydrogen bonds as broken lines. The redetermination of solvent positions at cycle 124 (Experimental Procedures, section (c)) resulted in 156 water molecules and two sulfate ions. Of the 153 water molecules in the model before re24 did not reappear. The water determination, molecules were ordered according to a quality factor (James & Sielecki, 1983), which is defined as occupancy2/B, and indicates roughly the reliability of each molecule. They were numbered sequentially in decreasing order of their quality factor. The 23 incorrect water molecules were among those with the lowest quality factors. It would seem that our refinement procedure is not always able to discriminate noise from weak features. (b) Comparison with homologous enzymes The amino acid sequences of a-lytic protease, SGPA, SGPB and a-chymotrypsin have been aligned (Table 4), and the amino acid residues are numbered according to this new alignment. This alignment was constructed from the results of the pairwise structural comparisons of the four proteins using the refined atomic co-ordinates. The fitting of each structure, one to the other, was done on the basis of a rigid body least-squares refinement procedure with C" atom co-ordinates only. The results are summarized in Table 5. It is clear from Tables 4 and 5 that the three bacterial enzymes are much more similar to one another than they are to a-chymotrypsin, although the structural equivalences to the latter are considerable. There are approximately 110 a-carbon atoms of the that structurally bacterial proteinases are equivalent to corresponding a-carbon atoms in the mammalian pancreatic proteinases.

In addition to the least-squares superimposition, we have compared the structures in pairs on the MMS-X interactive graphics system (Sielecki et al., 1982). In Table 4, the derived regions of structural equivalence are depicted in two ways. For the comparison of a-lytic protease with a-chymotrypsin, the 112 amino acid residues that are underlined (continuous or dotted lines at the bottom of the rows) are considered to be structurally equivalent. The 94 residues with a continuous underline are those for which the a-carbon atoms can be superimposed simultaneously within 1.9 A; the r.m.s. deviation in their positions is 1.04 A. The dotted underlines indicate the additional 18 residues that can be superimposed within 3.0 A (Table 4). The regions of structural equivalence among the three bacterial serine proteinases are indicated in Table 4 by continuous and dotted lines on top of the rows, below the sequence numbers. The criterion for deducing these regions was more stringent than that used for the comparison of a-lytic protease and a-chymotrypsin. Continuous lines correspond to those regions that are superimposed simultaneously to within 1.0 A; the r.m.s. deviations range from 0.40 A to 0.52 A. The dotted lines correspond to those additional residues that are superimposed simultaneously when the limit is relaxed to 1.9 A. The strands of polypeptide chain that exhibit the equivalence are those either greatest structural containing the residues of the catalytic triad, Asp102, His57 and Ser195, or are the strands spatially close to them. There are ten such strands forming two antiparallel P-pleated sheets that are the junction between the two domains of the enzyme (see Fig 5(a) and (b) for the a-lytic protease structure). Within the structurally equivalent regions of a-lytic protease and a-chymotrypsin, t'he amino acid sequence identity is relatively low; only 24 of the 112 structurally equivalent' residues are identical and, of these, 11 are on the strands carrying His57 and Ser195 (Table 4).

The Ca2+ binding loop of the trypsin family (residues 70 to 80 in the pancreatic serine proteases) is missing in a-lytic protease, as is the autolysis loop, 144-155. The part of the methionine loop from residue 164 to 176 has an a-helical conformation in cr-chymotrypsin, but is in an extended /?-sheet conformation in the bacterial enzymes. cc-Lytic protease has a four-residue insertion at position 219 in the primary specificity pocket that, in part, limits the size of P, residues in potential substrates.

The similarity of structure and sequence among the bacterial proteinases can be exemplified by comparing SGPA and a-lytic protease. Within the same definition of structural equivalence as used above, there are 159 structurally homologous pairs

equivalent pairs of residues in SGPA and a-lytic protease, 63 (40%) are chemically identical. This highly homologous folding of the polypeptide chain results in very similar active site regions of the two enzymes. Fitting 84 atoms from 15 amino acid residues that comprise the active site region of a-lytic protease to corresponding atoms of SGPA via a least-squares procedure results in an r.m.s. deviation of 0.28 A; for the corresponding atom pairs of SGPA and SGPB, this r.m.s. deviation is 0.15 A. With such remarkable structural similarity, it is not surprising that the chemical sequence identity
is maximal in the neighborhood of the catalytic

triads (Table 4). The active sites of these enzymes are found at the junction of the two domains of the molecules. Since the polypeptide chains are structurally equivalent in these domains, it is also likely that the equivalent amino acids of the hydrophobic core are identical. However, the hydrophobic cores (for the N-terminal and C-terminal domains) have markedly different amino acid compositions in SGPA and a-lytic protease. Of the 159 equivalent pairs of residues in SGPA and a-lytic protease, the 72 in the N-terminal domain have an r.m.s. deviation of 0.87 A, whereas the 87

some amino acid side-chains that do not contribute to the hydrophobic core have been omitted from Figure 6(a). It can be seen that in the vicinity of His57, AsplOQ, Cys42 and Cys58, both main-chain and amino acid side-chains have extremely similar conformations. However, the hydrophobic interiors of the two enzymes have vastly different chemical character; that of SGPA is predominantly aliphatic, whereas there are more aromatic residues making up the interior of cr-lytic protease. Also, it can be seen that as one moves farther from the active site, and more towards the periphery of the enzyme, the structural homology decreases and the polypeptide chains adopt less equivalent paths.

are represented in Figure 6(b) and (c). Insertions in the amino acid sequence for a-lytic protease at 15A and 15B and at 66 to 83 relative to SGPA are probably the cause of major differences in the polypeptide chain conformations near these sites (Fig. 6(b)). Residues Ile16, Tle31, Ile66, Va184 and LeulOS in a-lytic protease form an elliptically shaped region of hydrophobic side-chains in this portion of the core. The roughly equivalent volume of SGPA is occupied by four side-chains, Ilel6, Ile84, His108 and Asn46, but these residues are not coincident with the above five side-chains of a-lytic protease (Fig. 6(b)). The side-chain of Phe52 (seen in Fig. 6(b) and (c)) is located centrally in the N-terminal hydrophobic core of a-lytic protease. The side-chain of this residue is surrounded by the side-chains of Ile16, Tyr33, Va144, Thr54, Ile66, Va184, Va1106 and LeulOS. The structurally equivalent residue 52 in SGPA is an alanine. The large volume change associated with this amino acid substitution is accompanied by compensatory sequence changes in residues 33, 44, 84, 106 and 108, and some mainchain rearrangements. In spite of these changes, there are two small cavities in SGPA, situated in a volume equivalent to that occupied by the phenyl ring of Phe52 in a-lytic protease. These cavities are about 80 to 90% of the volume of a water molecule and are surrounded by apolar atoms. Similar small cavities have been observed in other protein structures (Lee & Richards, 1971). The C-terminal domains of a-lytic protease and SGPA have a greater degree of structural equivalence than do their N-terminal domains (Fig. 7). The major conformational differences are in the region of Cys220A (Brayer et al., 1979), where a-lytic protease has two insertions relative to SGPA, one of five residues, 218-219C, and one of three residues at 222B-223 (Table 4). The extended /?-loop, Ala130 to Thr163, in both enzymes is structurally equivalent. Where there are amino acid differences in this loop, the side-chains point to the surface. A high degree of structural equivalence among the bacterial serine proteases is required for this loop, as it is the location of the structurally and functionally important residue Arg138. The side-chain of Arg138 makes a buried salt-bridge to the carboxylate of Asp194 (James et al., 1978). Trp199 is located centrally in the C-terminal hydrophobic core of a-lytic protease. The structurally equivalent residue in SGPA is a leucine (Fig. 7). The relatively large volume difference between the side-chains of these two residues is associated with compensatory changes in both sequence and conformation at positions 136, 138, 181, 183, 185, 226 and 228. Two other sequence differences, Aia190 for Met190 and Thr213 for Met213 (Table 4 and Fig. 7) are, in part, responsible for the difference in substrate specificity between SGPA and a-lytic protease. This structural comparison reveals that, in spite of pronounced differences in the nature of the

The numbers of amino acids in each protein are given below the name. (The A chain of a-chymotrypsin has been omitted from this comparison.) The upper triangular portion of the matrix has the number of structurally equivalent a-carbon atom pairs that fit within 1.9 A of each other in the 2 enzymes compared. The r.m.s. deviation in A for those a-carbon atom pairs is given in parentheses. Comparisons of the bacterial serine proteinases with a-chymotrypsin also give in square brackets the numbers of a-carbon atom pairs that fit within 3.0 A. The lower triangular matrix gives the number of identical amino acid residues in the structurally equivalent portions of the pairs of enzymes. The number in parenthesis is the percentage of the residues comprising the structurally equivalent segments that are identical.

amino acid side-chains that constitute the hydrophobic interior of these related proteins, the basic folding pattern of the supporting polypeptide chain is preserved. (c) Hydrogen bonds (i ) DeJinition Commonly, a hydrogen bond is defined as a bond D-H and A (D = donor atom, between A = acceptor atom), specifically involving the hydrogen atom (e.g. see Pimentel & McClellan, 1960). It has been shown that much of the behavior of hydrogen bonds can be understood in terms of van der Waals' and electrostatic interactions (van Duijneveldt-van de Rijdt $ van Duijneveldt, 1971; Hagler et al., 1974). However, when analyzing a structure, one must resort to either geometric or energetic criteria with cutoff values to classify an interaction as being a hydrogen bond. In addition, in almost all protein structures, the position of the hydrogen atoms cannot be determined experimentally due to the limited resolution of data that can be obtained. Due to these difficulties, any listing of hydrogen bonds will have a degree of uncertainty. In our analysis, we have used strictly geometric criteria for determining the presence of a hydrogen bond. For nitrogen atoms with planar configurations, hydrogen atoms can be located reasonably well assuming standard geometry (program of S. Phillips). For cases where the hydrogen atom position is ambiguous, as in hydroxyl groups and quaternary amino groups, the optimal position in the plane of the donor and acceptor groups was assumed. No attempt was made to position the hydrogen atoms on solvent molecules. An interaction was considered to be a possible hydrogen bond if the H . . A distance was less than 2-4 A for oxygen acceptors and less than 2.5 A for

nitrogen acceptors. For hydrogen bonds between water molecules, and water molecules to acceptors on the protein, a cutoff of 3.4 A for the interatomic distance was used. It should be noted that the use of such geometric criteria and somewhat arbitrary cutoff values will result in some favorable interactions being and possibly some rejected accepted as interactions being unfavorable hydrogen bonds. (ii) Main-chain-main-chain hydrogen bond8 A listing of the possible hydrogen bonds between main-chain atoms is given in Table 6. The Table is according to the type of secondary divided structural unit. It can be seen that the protein is mainly made up of p-sheets with only a short a-helix from Leu231 to Gly239 and a very short 3io helix from Pro223 to Arg224. The turns were ciassified according to the criteria given by Venkatachalam (1968) and are summarized in Table 7. A type III (3,,) turn occurs at the N terminus of the a-helix between residues Leu231 and Ile234. The carbonyl group of Leu231 also accepts a hydrogen bond from Leu235 NH thus forming the start of an a-helix (Fig. 5(b)). It is more common for a 310 conformation to occur at the C-terminal end of a helix (Richardson, 1981). There is a single reverse open turn (Ramachandran & Mitra, 1976) from Phe94 to AsnlOl, with the only cis-proline of the molecule at position 95 (Fig. 8(a)). This type of turn is observed also in the homologous region of SGPA, as depicted in Figure S(b). The reverse open turn is distinct from the type VI turn, which has a cis-proline at the i+ 2 position (Richardson, 1981). In addition to the hydrogen bonds listed in Table 6, there is a group of main-chain-main-chain interactions that fall within the limits that we have set for a hydrogen bond but have nevertheless not been included in the Table, These involve residues

Numbers refer to residues of a-lytic protease and correspond to the alignment in Table 4. Mainly, only those side-chains contributing to the hydrophobic core are represented in (a). The active site residues His57 and Asp102 are at the bottom of the Figure in this orientation. (b) A section through the N-terminal cores of a-lytic protease and SGPA; this view is approximately orthogonal to that in (a) from the top. Major differences in polypeptide chain conformations for the 2 enzymes are evident in this comparison, e.g. from residues 64 to 85 where there is a B-residue insertion in a-lytic protease (Table 4). Residues of a-lytic protease contributing to the core are: Ilel6, Ile31, Phe52, Ile66, Va184, Leu108 and Leull4. (c) The neighboring section of the cores to that in (b). The position of Phe52 is common to both views (b) and (c) for reference. The large volume difference between Phe and Ala at position 52 is only partially compensated by other changes in the region of these residues. The polypeptide chains in this section of both molecules is much more structurally equivalent than that shown in (b).

Figure 7. Stereoscopic view of the C-terminal hydrophobic core of cc-lytic protease compared with that of SGPA. Numbers refer to residues of a-lytic protease and correspond to the alignment in Table 4. Ser195 is located towards the top of the diagram. The Trp199 to Leu199 difference is centrally located. Compensatory changes involve residues 136, 138, 181, 183, 185, 226 and 228. The conformations of the polypeptide chains in these C-terminal domains are much more similar than in the N-terminal domains of the 2 enzymes.

in what is known as C, conformation. In these residues, the N-H and C=O groups are almost coplanar with H . . . 0 distances of about 2.3 A and N-H . . . 0 angles of about 100". In most cases, these residues are part of a b-sheet and presumably the C, conformation is imposed on them by the secondary structure. However, there are other cases in which the reasons for adopting such a conformation are not clear. It is not obvious what the nature of the interaction is in a C, conformation and whether it is justified to classify it as a hydrogen bond. The existence of such interactions has been inferred from infrared spectra of model peptides in Ccl, (Avignon e2al., 1969). We examined in detail the angular parameters of the main-chain hydrogen bonds. Figure 9 shows the angle at the hydrogen atom as a function of the hydrogen to acceptor distance. The trend seen in the plot is similar to that observed in small molecule structures (Olovsson & Jonsson, 1976). The linear configuration at the shorter hydrogen to acceptor distances would minimize the unfavorable contact between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms (Hagler et al., 1974). In human lysozyme, Artymiuk & Blake (1981) analyzed the polar angles of the hydrogen bond at the acceptor atom. They defined two angles, p and y, where /I is the angular position of the hydrogen atom with respect to the plane of the peptide group and y is the azimuthal angle in the peptide plane with the zero defined by the C=O direction (see Fig. 10, inset).

They observed for human lysozyme a clustering of points corresponding to residues in u-helices, turns and b-sheets into different regions of a B-y plot. The corresponding plot for a-lytic protease is shown in Figure 10. A similar clustering of secondary structural units can be seen. In addition, the different types of turns cluster into separate regions. The types I and III turns are in a region (60, -30) in /3, y and type II turns are around (30, -30). All the turns I', II' and III' cluster together at around ( - 50, - 30). A corresponding pair of polar angles can be defined also at the amide hydrogen atom of peptides: /I' is the angular position of the acceptor atom with respect to the peptide plane, ?nd y' is the azimuthal angle in that plane with the zero defined by the N-H direction. The plot of /Y--y' is shown in secondary Figure 11. Here again, the different structural units seem to be localized into different regions. However, the various types of turns do not cluster into separate groups and the a-helix does not seem to cluster at all. The angular parameters for the helix may not be representative, since there is only a short a-helical segment in this molecule. (iii) Hydrogen bonds to side-chain atoms The possible hydrogen bonds involving the sidechains are shown in Tables 8 and 9. The listing in Table 8 is much more tentative, as it involves donor groups whose hydrogen atom positions are ambiguous (amino terminus, Lys, Ser, Thr and Tyr). The hydrogen atoms were placed in the

optimal position as described in section (c)(i), above, and the distances and angles in the Table are included to give an idea of the geometry of the interaction. Most of the groups listed in this Table also make additional hydrogen bonds with solvent molecules. The possible hydrogen bonds listed in Table 9, on the other hand, involve hydrogen atoms that can be located assuming standard geometry, and thus the interactions can be examined with
more confidence. An uncertainty concerning the protonation state of the single histidine residue (His57f arises. Since the crystal was grown at pH 6.1, which is at or near

the normal pKa value of histidine (normally 65), the equilibrium favors a partially protonated (i.e. partially positively charged) atate in the imidazole ring, From nuclear magnetic resonance data,

Westler et al. (1982) have reported pKa values from 5.9 to 6.5 for this residue of or-lytic protease, depending on the sample preparation. In any case, Nd' of the histidine is protonated; a stron hydrogen bond exists from this atom to Asp1020' 5 (Brayer et al., 1979). At one time there was a controversy about whether the proton was on the histidine or on the aspartate (Hunkapiller et aE., 1973). The question now seems to have been resolved in favor of the proton being on the histidine (Bachovchin et al., 1981). The hydrogen-bonding interactions found in this study indicate that N" of the histidine is also protonated, making the imidazole group positively charged. In Tables 9 and 9, there are several intraresidue interactions (marked by asterisks) that fall within our hydrogen-bonding criteria. A five-membered

et al. interaction present in the latter. Six-membered ring-like structures can result from an interaction either between the hydroxyl hydrogen atom of serine and threonine residues to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom, or from the main-chain N-H to the side-chain carbonyl group of aspartate or asparagine residues (Fig. 12). For cases involving a serine or a threonine, the actual hydrogen atom position is not known, so that the existence of such an interaction is difficult to assess. The last type involves a hydrogen bond between the main-chain N-H and the side-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of glutamate or glutamine. There is one example of this in a-lytic protease at Glu174 A similar with x1 = -56" and x2 = 77". conformation of a glutamate side-chain has been observed at the reactive site of the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor domain III (Read et al., 1983). The torsional angles for Glul91 in that structure are x1 = 61", xz = -62". The most commonly observed conformation for a glutamate side-chain has torsional angles x1 = - 60", x2 = 180" (Janin et al., 1978). More than two-thirds of the interactions listed in Tables 8 and 9 occur between side-chain and mainchain atoms. Of these, those involving aspartate and asparagine residues are of particular interest in their role in determining the structure of a protein. for aspartate and There is a high probability especially asparagine residues to be located in a reverse turn (Crawford et al., 1973). In addition, these residues can form a reverse turn-like structure, the Asx turn (Rees et al., 1983). In these structures, the Asx side-chain CO group takes the role of the main-chain carbonyl group of the ith residue in a normal turn. In a-lytic protease, ASX

respectively.

Refined Structure turns are observed at Asn219B and at Asn219D. Asx residues are found frequently also at the end of /?-sheets (Richardson, 1981). Here again, the sidechain CO can replace a main-chain carbonyl group, resulting in the termination of the /J-sheet. Unlike the Asx turn, which has the same number of atoms as a reverse turn, the termination of a p-sheet by an Asx residue involves an extra atom (Ca) as compared to a p-sheet interaction. The insertion of the additional atom could make that type of interaction less favorable. However, the numerous occurrences of this structure in c!-lytic protease, at Asn36, Asn184, Asp194, Asn219B and Asn220 (Fig. 13(a) to (d)), indicate that it is an important structural element. There is a somewhat special hydrogen bond not listed in the Tables. This is the interaction between the side-chains of Trp199 and Met213. The distance from Trp199He1 to Met213SY is 2-5 A, while the distance from the Nel of the tryptophan side-chain to S' is 3.4 b. The angle at the hydrogen is 150". A cutoff of 2-8 A for the H . . _ S distance was used for hydrogen bonds to sulfur acceptors. (iv) Intermolecular hydrogen bonds There are relatively few direct hydrogen bonds between protein molecules in the crystal, and these are given in Table 10. Most of the intermolecular interactions involve bridging solvent molecules. (d) Charge interactions a?-Lytic protease is a basic protein with 12 arginine, two tysine, four glutamate, two aspartate,

one histidine residue and the free amino and carboxy termini. All the negatively charged groups interact either directly, or indirectly via solvent bridges, to positively charged groups. The C terminus forms a hydrogen-bonded bridge through Wat138 to Arg122N". Three of the four glutamate residues interact directly with arginine residues, while the remaining Glu174 forms a hydrogenbonded bridge through Wat97 and Wat138 to Arg122 of a neighboring molecule. Both of the aspartate residues are buried. AsplO2, which is a member of the catalytic triad Asp vHis *Ser, is stabilized by hydrogen-bonding to His57N" as well as to Gly56N, His57N and Ser2140Y. The other aspartate, Asp194, is also a very important residue, as it is conserved in the>fs+ily of serine proteases with the active site sequence Gly-Asp-Ser-Gly-Gly. The side-chain of Asp194 is within 3.4 A of the guanidinium group of Arg138, but there is no hydrogen bond between these groups. Instead, the interaction is mediated by hydrogen bonds to Thr1430Y (Fig. 14). There is an intricate hydrogenbonding network in the vicinity of these residues, including interactions with a strongly bound internal water molecule, Wat2. In the pancreatic serine proteases, this aspartate residue interacts with the N terminus and is important in the activation of the zymogen (Huber & Bode, 1978). The two sulfate ions in the structure make a number of intermolecular interactions. The possible hydrogen bonds involving these molecules are listed in Table 11, and Figure 15(a) and (b) show their environments. Sull is located in the binding site of

solvent. Of these, Arg192 seems to have two distinct side-chain conformations in the crystal (Fig. 16). The alternate conformation may be less favorable as the side-chain would become buried in the packing interface and it would then be positioned close to Argl22 of a neighboring molecule. (e) Solvents Assuming a solvent density of 1.0 g/cm3 and a partial specific volume of the protein of 0.73 ml/g, it is estimated that there are about 890 water molecules in an asymmetric unit of the crystal of a-lytic protease. Thus, the 156 ordered water molecules represent only 18% of the total solvent content. In contrast, the homologous bacterial serine proteases SGPA and SGPB have 235 and 249 solvent sites, respectively (Sielecki & James, 1981; Sawyer et al., unpublished results). These results indicate that there may be more solvent sites yet to be found in the a-lytic protease crystal. However, the number of ordered solvent sites will also depend on the crystal packing and the thermal motion of the protein. There are nine internal water molecules in the

a-lytic protease structure. Two of these are isolated molecules inside the protein, while the remaining ones occur as two dimers and one trimer, which are hydrogen-bonded together (Fig. 17). As expected, most of these water sites refine with very high occupancies and low temperature factors. Their quality factors (section (a), above) are among the highest. 20. Two exceptions are two of the water molecules in the trimer that are located at number 59 and 99 in the quality factor ordering. The analysis of the general features of the solvent structure showed results similar to those found in other structures (Blake et al., 1983; Watenpaugh et al., 1978; Finney , 1979). Figure 18 shows a histogram of the closest contact distances from solvent to protein. It shows a peak around 2.8 A representing an ideal hydrogen-bonding distance. There is no significant evidence of a second shell of ordered water molecules further away from the protein. One water molecule is located 2.4 A from the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala202, and there are nine other water molecules with contact distances less than 26 A. These were not rejected, since the estimated error for the protein and the solvent atoms are about 0.10 A and O-15 A, respectively. Following Blake et al. (1983), we grouped the solvents into different categories according to the hydrogen bonds that are made (Table 12). Of the seven water molecules that make no hydrogen bonds, six of them have polar groups within 4.0 A. The remaining water molecule (Wat126) is located in a region of weak electron density and is not reliable. The breakdown of solvents according to the type of the group or the atom on the protein to which they are bound is shown in Table 13. The distribution is similar to that observed in lysozyme (Blake et al., 1983) and penicillopepsin (James & Sielecki, 1983).
