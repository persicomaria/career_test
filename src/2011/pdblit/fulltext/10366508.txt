It is regretted that an error occurred in the above paper. In the Abstract and Results and Discussion sections the free R-factor value was listed as 0.8 % instead of 20.8 %. The corrected sentences are given below. The ®rst sentence of the abstract should read: The crystal structure of a dimeric apo form of the soluble quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (s-GDH) from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement followed by density Ê modi®cation, and was subsequently re®ned at 1.72 A resolution to a ®nal crystallographic R-factor of 16.5 % and free R-factor of 20.8 %. The ®rst senctence of the `Re®nement and quality of the model' section in the Results and Discussion should read: È Final crystallographic (Rcrys) and free (Rfree: Brunger, 1992) R-factor values of 16.5 % and 20.8 %, respectÊ ively, were obtained for data from 20.0 to 1.72 A resolution (no s cut-off).
