ABSTRACT: The RNA molecules that make up the spliceosome branch-point helix and the binding site for phage GA coat protein share a secondary structure motif in which two consecutive adenine residues occupy the strand opposite a single uridine, creating the potential to form one of two different A,U base pairs while leaving the other adenine unpaired or bulged. During the splicing of introns out of pre-mRNA, the 2-OH of the bulged adenine participates in the transesterification reaction at the 5-exon and forms the branch-point residue of the lariat intermediate. Either adenine may act as the branch-point residue in mammals, but the 3-proximal adenine does so preferentially. When bound to phage GA coat protein, the bulged adenine loops out of the helix and occupies a binding pocket on the surface of the protein, forming a nucleation complex for phage assembly. The coat protein can bind helices with bulged adenines at either position, but the 3-proximal site binds with greater affinity. We have studied this RNA motif in a 21 nucleotide hairpin containing a GA coat protein-binding site whose four nucleotide loop has been replaced by a more stable loop from the related phage Ms2. Using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the structure of this hairpin to an overall precision of 2.0 Å. Both adenine bases stack into the helix, and while all available NOE and coupling constant data are consistent with both possible A,U base pairs, the base pair involving the 5-proximal adenine appears to be the major conformation. The 3-proximal bulged adenine protonates at unusually high pH, and to account for this, we propose a model in which the protonated adenine is stabilized by a hydrogen bond to the uridine O2 of the A,U base pair. The 2-OH of the bulged adenine adopts a regular A-form helical geometry, suggesting that in order to participate in the splicing reaction, the conformation of the branch-point helix in the active spliceosome may change from the conformation described here. Thus, while the adenine site preferences of the spliceosome and of phage GA may be due to protein factors, the preferred adenine is predisposed in the free RNA to conformational rearrangement involved in formation of the active complexes.

Unpaired or bulged nucleotides are a class of RNA secondary structural motifs that serve as sites of protein recognition and binding (reviewed in ref 1), participate in RNA cleavage and ligation (2, 3), and may play a role in the folding of large RNAs (4). The unique three-dimensional structures of RNAs with unpaired bases presumably contribute to their biological functions. The conformations of bulged bases in DNA oligonucleotides have been extensively studied using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)1 spectroscopy. In general, bulged purine bases tend to stack into the helix (5) while bulged pyrimidine bases either stack into or loop out of the helix depending upon temperature and the identity of neighboring nucleotides (6, 7).

bases in RNA oligonucleotides have been studied, but the conformation of a bulged purine base may depend on whether its flanking regions form Watson-Crick base pairs (8-10). Genetic and biochemical investigations have revealed that a bulged base is necessary for the splicing of introns out of pre-mRNA (3, 11). The first cleavage step of nuclear premRNA splicing involves nucleophilic attack of the phosphate at the 5-splice site by the 2-OH group of the branch-point adenine nucleotide to produce the 5-exon and the lariat intermediate (12). The branch-point nucleotide is located within a bimolecular helix formed by pairing between the U2 snRNA and the pre-mRNA within the spliceosome. The primary structure of the branch-point helix is highly conserved in yeast, with adenine serving as the branch-point residue and an A,U base pair occupying the 5-flanking position (Figure 1) (11). Thus, the branch-point residue is the 3-proximal adenine nucleotide of an RNA bulge motif defined by two adjacent adenine nucleotides opposite a uridine nucleotide, referred to in this report as the (A-A), U motif. The primary structure of the branch-point helix is less conserved in mammals, but the optimal nucleotide sequence for splicing remains the (A-A),U motif (13, 14). In addition, both adenines can act as the branch-point nucleotide in mammals, but the 3-proximal site preferentially does so 95% of the time (3).

NMR Structure and Dynamics of a Bulged RNA Motif

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 39, 1998 13487 proximal adenine preferentially bulges but remains stacked into the helix and is predisposed to conformational rearrangement. The structural and dynamic features of the (AA),U motif appear to play a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing and GA coat protein binding. MATERIALS AND METHODS All enzymes were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO), except for T7 RNA polymerase, which was prepared as described (18). Deoxyribonuclease I type II, pyruvate kinase, adenylate kinase, and nucleotide monophosphate kinase were obtained as powders, dissolved in solutions of 15% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then stored at -20 °C. Guanylate kinase and nuclease P1 were obtained as solutions and stored at -20 °C. Unlabeled 5-nucleoside triphosphates (5-NTPs) were purchased from Sigma, phosphoenolpyruvate (potassium salt) was purchased from Bachem, and 99% [15N]ammonium sulfate and 99% [13C]glucose were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Labs. Preparation of RNA Samples. The hybrid phage Ms2/ GA RNA sequence, RNA I, shown in Figure 1 was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and a synthetic DNA template (19, 20). The nucleotide sequence of the stem was modified from the wild-type GA sequence to promote efficient transcription and to simplify the resonance assignments. Unlabeled RNA molecules were prepared from 20 mL transcription reactions using 4 mM 5-NTPs. Isotopically labeled RNA molecules were prepared from 14 mL transcription reactions using 3 mM uniform 15Nand 13C/15N-enriched 5-NTPs as described (21, 22). The RNA molecules were purified by passage through 20% (w/ v) preparative polyacrylamide gels, electroluted (Schleicher and Schuell), and precipitated with ethanol. The purified oligonucleotides were dissolved in 1.0 M NaCl, 20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 2.0 mM EDTA and dialyzed extensively against 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 0.05 mM EDTA, using a Centricon-3 concentrator (Amicon Inc.). The samples were diluted with buffer to a volume of 210 µL and lyophilized to a powder. For experiments involving the nonexchangeable protons, the samples were exchanged twice with 99.9% 2H2O and then resuspended in 210 µL of 99.96% 2H2O. For experiments involving the exchangeable protons, the samples were resuspended in 210 µL of 90% H2O/10% 2H2O. The samples contained 110-130 A260 OD units in 210 µL (2.3-2.7 mM). Preparation of Ms2 Coat Protein. The Ms2 coat protein variant was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells containing the plasmid for the V75E;A81G Ms2 coat protein variant (23). The protein was purified as reported (23) and stored at 4 °C. Protein-RNA complex was prepared on ice by diluting RNA hairpin (1.2 mM) with coat protein (0.22 mM) in a buffer of 10 mM NaCl, 100 mM Na2SO4, and 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O. The final concentration of complex was 0.18 mM. The noncompetitive and competitive RNA hairpins, 5-(GGGAUACUGCUUCGGUAAGUCCC)-3 and 5-(GGGAUCACCAUUAGGGAUCUC)-3, respectively, were added to the complex in molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:0.5, complex:hairpin.

FIGURE 1: Sequence and secondary structures of the conserved branch-point helix from yeast, the RNA operator from phage GA, and the RNA molecule used in this study, RNA I. Residues in the GA operator are numbered relative to the replicase start codon. Each secondary structure contains the (A-A),U secondary structure motif.

The bulged base motif is also important for protein recognition in bacteriophage. Ms2 and GA are singlestranded positive sense RNA phage that infect Escherichia coli by adsorbing to conjugative F pili. Their coat proteins bind a 21 nucleotide region of their genome containing the ribosome-binding site and start codon of the replicase gene, preventing translation of the replicase and promoting the encapsidation of the RNA into phage particles (15, 16). The coat protein binding site consists of a base-paired stem with a single unpaired adenosine and a four nucleotide loop (Figure 1). Mutagenesis studies have shown that, provided the overall secondary structure is maintained, there are only a few nucleotides whose identity is necessary for binding to Ms2 coat protein: an adenine at position -4, a pyrimidine at position -5, and purines at positions -7 and -10 (16). GA coat protein is less restrictive: it does not require a pyrimidine at -5 and is able to bind hairpins with purines at either position -10 or position -11 (17). The wild-type GA operator contains the (A-A),U motif so that adenines occupy both the -10 and -11 positions, but biochemical investigations have demonstrated that the GA coat protein binds hairpins with single bulged adenines with 3-fold greater affinity if the bulged base occupies the 3-proximal rather than the 5-proximal position (17). The (A-A),U motif can thus contribute to a variety of biological functions in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, but its three-dimensional molecular structure is not known. While it is possible that other protein or RNA factors permit the motif to function in a variety of roles, it is also possible that the motif has unique structural or dynamic characteristics that are important for the various functions in which it participates. The motif may adopt a static conformation in which either the 5- or 3-proximal adenine is preferentially bulged. Alternatively, there may be no preference for either adenine to bulge, inducing the uridine to rapidly switch between the two adenine positions and result in a dynamic and perhaps disordered region of the helix. We have used heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy to study the solution structure and dynamics of the (A-A),U motif in a 21 nucleotide RNA hairpin containing a phage GA coat protein-binding site whose four nucleotide loop has been replaced by the more stable AUUA loop from the related phage Ms2 (Figure 1). Our results indicate that the 3-

All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer equipped with a 1H-[13C, 15 N] triple resonance probe, except for the 31P-decoupled 13C1 H constant time (ct) HSQC experiment, which was collected on a Varian Unity Plus 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 1H-[13C, 31P] triple resonance probe. Broad-band decoupling of the carbon and nitrogen resonances was achieved using GARP with B2 ) 3125 Hz for carbon and B2 ) 1570 Hz for nitrogen. 1H2O spectra were collected at 10° C with solvent suppression using either spin lock pulses or binomial 11 or 1331 read pulses with maximum excitation h h h at 12.5 ppm. 2H2O spectra were collected at 22 °C with presaturation or spin lock pulses to suppress the residual HDO peak. Quadrature detection was achieved using the States-TPPI method, and acquisition was delayed by a halfdwell in all indirectly detected dimensions, unless otherwise noted. Typically, the data points were extended by 33% using linear prediction for the indirectly detected dimensions and the data were apodized using 1 Hz line broadening and 65° shifted sinebell functions. 1H spectra were referenced to the internal HDO resonance at 4.80 ppm at 20 °C. The 13C, 15N, and 31P spectra were referenced to external standards of TSP, NH4OH, and TMP, respectively, which resonate at 0.00 ppm. All spectra were processed and analyzed with Felix 95.0 (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Further details of the acquisition and processing parameters are provided as Supporting Information. 2D 13C-1H HMQC and HSQC spectra were collected to identify 13C-1H chemical shift correlations. 3D HCCHCOSY and HCCH-TOCSY (24 ms DIPSI-3 spin lock) experiments optimized for polarization transfer through the ribose carbons and a 2D 13C-1H HCCH-TOCSY (52 ms DIPSI-3 spin lock) optimized for polarization transfer through the adenine bases were collected in 2H2O to identify ribose spin systems and H8-H2 correlations, respectively (24, 25). To identify intraresidue base-sugar correlations, a 2D 15N-1H HSQC experiment was acquired in 2H2O and optimized for two- and three-bond correlations as reported (26), except that the 15N-1H antiphase magnetization was refocused after the t1 evolution period to achieve cross-peaks that were in-phase in 1 and 2 and to permit application of broad-band 15N decoupling during the t2 acquisition period. Distance constraints for the nonexchangeable resonances were derived from 2D 1H-1H NOESY spectra (65, 100, 160, and 400 ms mixing times), a 13C-edited 3D NOESY-HMQC spectrum (420 ms mixing time), and 13C-edited 3D NOESYctHSQC spectra (75, 160, 210, and 420 ms mixing time) optimized for the ribose resonances in 2 and 3. For the exchangeable resonances, 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectra were collected to identify 15N-1H chemical shift correlations. 2D 1H-1H NOESY and 13C-edited 2D NOESY-HMQC spectra optimized for imino (NH) proton resonances in 2 were acquired at 380 ms mixing time in 1H2O to obtain distance restraints involving the exchangeable protons. Backbone dihedral angle constraints were derived from spectra collected to measure 1H-1H, 31P-1H, and 13C-31P coupling constants. A 31P-decoupled DQF-COSY experiment and a 2D HetCor experiment were acquired in 2H2O with an unlabeled RNA sample. Three-bond 31P-13C coupling constants were measured using a pair of 2D 13C-1H ctHSQC experiments with and without 31P decoupling in t1 (27).
13C

Smith and Nikonowicz T1F relaxation times were measured using 2D 13C-1H ctHSQC based experiments (28) separately optimized for C6/8 and C1 regions by centering the 13C carrier at 135.2 and 91.7 ppm, respectively. A 2.3 kHz 13C spin lock field was used with delays of 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 32, 40, 64, and 80 ms and 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 36, 44, 52, 80, and 104 ms for the C1 and C6/8 measurements, respectively. The 12 ms experiment was collected twice to provide an estimate of the error of the measured intensities. The 13C-1H cross-peak volumes were fit to a single-exponential decay. Interproton Distance Constraints. Semiquantitative distance constraints between nonexchangeable protons were estimated from cross-peak intensities in 2D NOESY spectra and in 3D 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Using the covalently fixed pyrimidine H5-H6 distance (2.4 Å) and the conformationally restricted sugar H1-H2 distance (2.8-3.0 Å) as references, peak intensities were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak and their corresponding proton pairs given upper bound distance constraints of 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 Å, respectively. Cross-peaks observed only at mixing times greater than 210 ms were classified as extremely weak and given 7.0 Å upper bound distance constraints to account for the possibility of spin diffusion. To improve convergence of the calculations, all distance constraints were given lower bounds of 0.0 Å. Distance constraints involving exchangeable protons were estimated from 2D 1H-1H and 13C-1H NOESY spectra and were classified as either weak, very weak, or extremely weak, except for the intra-base-pair distances A,U H2-NH, G,C NH-NH2, and G,U NH-NH, which were classified as strong constraints. Intraresidue sugar-to-sugar constraints were not included in the calculations. An initial set of structures was calculated using a shortened version of the simulated annealing protocol (described below) with a model-built A-form helix as a starting structure. A list of all proton pairs in the calculated structures closer than 5.0 Å (representing expected NOEs) was compared to the list of constraints. The NOESY spectra were then reexamined for predicted NOEs absent from the constraint list. In some cases, this allowed the unambiguous assignment of previously unidentified NOEs, but in other cases, the predicted NOEs were unobservable due to spectral overlap or the broadening of resonances by exchange with solvent. After the final calculations, virtually all predicted NOEs not in the list could be accounted for by spectral overlap or exchange broadening. No NOEs could be observed, however, for five proton pairs involving loop residue A13 that were consistently found to be closer than 5.0 Å in calculated structures (see Discussion). Hydrogen-Bonding Constraints. Watson-Crick base pairs were identified using two criteria: the observation of a significantly downfield shifted NH or NH2 proton resonance and the observation of strong G,C NH-NH2 or A,U H2NH NOEs. The wobble G,U pair was identified by observation of a strong NOE between guanine and uridine NH resonances. Hydrogen bonds were introduced as distance restraints of 2.9 ( 0.3 Å between donor and acceptor heavy atoms and 2.0 ( 0.2 Å between acceptor and hydrogen atoms. Constraints identified in this way were included in the calculations for base pairs G1,C21, G2,C20, C3,G19, G4, U18, U5,A17, G8,C15, and G9,C14.

NMR Structure and Dynamics of a Bulged RNA Motif Dihedral Angle Constraints. Constraints on the ribose ring and backbone dihedral angles were derived from semiquantitative measurements of 3JH-H, 3JH-P, and 3JC-P couplings (27, 29). Sugar pucker conformations were determined from 3 JH1-H2 couplings in 31P-decoupled 2D DQF-COSY spectra. Residues with couplings >7 Hz were constrained to the C2endo conformation through three of the torsion angles in the ribose sugar ring (30). Independent confirmation of sugar pucker conformation was provided by the observation of weak (<5 Hz) 3JH3-H4 couplings, C3 resonances shifted downfield to 76-80 ppm from the main cluster at 70-72 ppm, and C4 resonances shifted downfield to 85-86 ppm from the main cluster at 82-84 ppm (31). Residues with weak (<5 Hz) 3JH1-H2 couplings and large (>5 Hz) 3JH3-H4 couplings were constrained to the C3-endo conformation. Residues with intermediate 3JH1-H2 couplings were left unconstrained to reflect the possibility of conformational averaging. Dihedral angle constraints for the -torsion angle were derived from 3JH4-H5 and 3JH4-H5 couplings in the DQFCOSY spectrum and intraresidue H4-H5 and H4-H5 cross-peak intensities in the 75 ms mixing time 3D NOESYctHSQC spectrum. For residues in which H4-H5 and H4-H5 peaks in the DQF-COSY spectra were clearly absent, representing couplings of <5 Hz,  was constrained to the gauche+ conformation (60 ( 20°) (30, 32). For residues with clear 3JH4-H5 or 3JH4-H5 couplings of >5 Hz and unequal H4-H5 and H4-H5 NOE intensities,  was constrained to include both the trans and gauche- conformations (-120 ( 120°), reflecting the lack of stereospecific assignments for the H5 and H5 resonances. For residues with only weak or unobservable 3JH4-H5 or 3JH4-H5 couplings and unequal H4-H5 and H4-H5 NOE intensities,  was left unconstrained to reflect the possibility of conformational averaging. Dihedral angle restraints for the - and -torsion angles were derived from 3JP-H5, 3JP-H5, and 3JP-H3 couplings measured in 2D 31P-1H HetCor spectra and 3JP-C2 couplings measured in 2D ctHSQC spectra. was constrained to the trans conformation (180 ( 20°) for residues in which P-H5 and P-H5 peaks in the HetCor spectra were clearly absent, representing couplings of <5 Hz (30, 32). For residues in which P-H5 and P-H5 peaks could be observed, was left unconstrained to reflect the lack of stereospecific assignments and the possibility of conformational averaging. was constrained to the trans conformation (-145 ( 20°) for residues with 3JP-H3 > 5 Hz and 3JP-C2 < 5 Hz and to the gauche- conformation (-100 ( 25°) for residues with 3J 3 P-H3 > 5 Hz and JP-C2 > 5 Hz (30, 32). Residues with 3J 3 P-H3 > 5 Hz but for which JP-C2 could not be measured were loosely constrained to include both conformations (-120 ( 45°). Dihedral angle restraints for R and were derived from the observation that a trans conformation of either dihedral angle is generally associated with a large downfield shift of the bridging 31P resonance (33). Because no such shift is observed for any of the 31P resonances in the hybrid hairpin, R and were loosely constrained to exclude the trans conformation (0 ( 120°) for all residues except those in the bulge or loop regions, which were left unconstrained. No dihedral angle constraints were used for the glycosidic angle

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 39, 1998 13489 . A total of 69 dihedral angle restraints (10 R, 12 , 17 , 20 , and 10 ) were used in the calculations. Structure Calculations. All calculations were carried out on Silicon Graphics Indy work stations using X-PLOR 3.1 (34). The dihedral angles of a model structure (generated using Insight II, Molecular Simulations, Inc.) were randomized to generate 50 starting structures which were used in a simulated annealing/restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) routine (30). The calculation protocol was divided into three stages: global fold, refinement, and final minimization. The global fold step consisted of 1000 cycles of unconstrained energy minimization, 15 ps of rMD at 1000 K using only hydrogen bond and NOE constraints, 24 ps of rMD at 1000 K during which repulsive van der Waals forces were introduced, 14 ps of rMD while cooling to 300 K, and 1000 cycles of constrained minimization. The structures were then refined with 500 cycles of constrained minimization; 3 ps of rMD at 1000 K, during which the , , , and sugar ring dihedral constraints were slowly introduced followed by another 3 ps, during which the R and constraints were introduced; 3.5 ps of rMD while cooling to 300 K; and 1000 cycles of constrained minimization. The final step consisted of 1000 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization using all constraints and repulsive van der Waals potentials. To determine the consistency of the NMR data with different possible base-pairing schemes in the bulge, three additional sets of calculations were performed: one with A6,U16 base pair constraints, one with A7,U16 base pair constraints, and one with A6,U16 base pair constraints and an additional U16 O2-A7 N1 constraint. These calculations were performed by taking the global-fold-stage structures of converged calculations and re-refining and reminimizing them with the appropriate base constraints. Calculated structures were viewed using MidasPlus (UCSF) and Insight II. RESULTS Chemical Shift Assignments. The nonexchangeable 1H and resonances of RNA I (Figure 1) were assigned using standard heteronuclear techniques (35, 36). Most of the base and ribose 1H-13C correlations are resolved and only the A6 H2 and C14 H1 resonances have spectral characteristics indicative of intermediate exchange. All 21 ribose spin systems, except for the incompletely labeled 5-terminal nucleotide, were identified using 3D HCCH-COSY and 3D HCCH-TOCSY experiments (24, 25). Four of the five adenine intrabase H8-H2 correlations were identified using similar experiments optimized for magnetization transfer through the adenine bases. Intraresidue base-to-sugar correlations were identified using 2D 15N-1H HSQC experiments optimized to yield the multiple bond correlations H5-N1, H8-N9, and H1-N1/N9 (26). Eight of the 10 pyrimidine correlations were identified in these spectra, but the degeneracy of the N9 resonances permitted only 2 of the 11 purine correlations to be unambiguously identified. Interestingly, H2-N1/N9 correlations were observed for U11, U12, and A13, suggesting these nucleotides do not have C3-endo ribose ring puckers or that they have unusual T2 relaxation properties. Sequential assignments for the nonexchangeable resonances were made using 3D 13C-edited NOESY experiments

Gray and black bars indicate the number of interresidue and conformationally restrictive intraresidue distance constraints, respectively, used in the calculations. Interresidue constraints are counted as onehalf constraint for each residue involved. White bars indicate the number of backbone dihedral angle constraints. Base pair and sugar pucker constraints are not included. FIGURE 2: Base H6/8-to-H1 region of the 2D 160 ms NOESY spectrum.

to identify sequential H6/8-H1 NOE connectivities (35). The intraresidue 15N-1H base-to-sugar correlations simplified the assignment process by permitting intraresidue cross-peaks to be distinguished from interresidue cross-peaks. The sequential base-1 NOE connectivities are continuous through all 21 nucleotides in the 420 ms NOESY spectrum, but in the 160 ms spectrum, the interresidue connectivities are interrupted between loop nucleotides A10, U11, U12, and A13. The H6/8-H1 sequential walk is continuous through the bulge region (Figure 2). The H6/8-H2 interresidue connectivities are continuous through most of the molecule, but in the 160 ms spectrum the U12-A13 and A13-C14 connectivities are weak and the U11-U12 connectivity is absent, consistent with disruption of the helix suggested by the C2endo ribose ring conformations of U11, U12, and A13. The exchangeable NH and NH2 resonances were assigned using 2D NOESY and 2D 15N-edited NOESY-HMQC experiments. Briefly, the NH resonances of the G,U base pair were first identified by their characteristically strong NH-NH NOE cross-peak. The remaining NH resonances were assigned using the weaker NOE connectivities between NH proton resonances of neighboring base pairs. These connectivities are continuous in the helix from G2 to U5. The cytidine NH2 resonances were assigned using the strong intrabase-pair C NH2 to G NH NOE cross-peaks. Independent confirmation of the resonance assignments was provided by strong cytidine intrabase NH2 to H5 NOE cross-peaks in G, C base pairs, by strong uridine NH to adenine H2 NOE crosspeaks in A,U base pairs, and by uridine H5 to NH nitrogen correlations in long-range HMQC spectra. The NH proton resonances of U11, and U12 and the NH2 resonances of A6, A7, C15, and all guanine nucleotides except G4 were not observed and could not be assigned. Two adenine NH2 resonances that are present in HSQC spectra but do not give rise to cross-peaks in NOESY spectra have been tentatively assigned to A10 and A13. All other exchangeable proton and protonated nitrogen resonances were assigned. Because

divalent metal ion is required for the splicing reaction, a 2D HMQC spectrum was collected for RNA I after addition of 10 mM Mg2+. No chemical shift changes are observed, but the U5 NH resonance is slightly weakened. This suggests that Mg2+ may associate with the RNA helix, but does not induce significant structural changes. All internucleotide 31P resonances are dispersed between -3.4 and -4.6 ppm. Eighteen out of 20 31P resonances were able to be assigned using the P-H3 correlations from 2D 31 1 P- H HetCor spectra. Several P-H4 and P-H5/H5 correlations also were present in the HetCor spectra and provided independent confirmation of the 31P assignments. Structure Calculations. The structure of RNA I was calculated using a restrained molecular dynamics routine starting from 50 structures with completely random backbone dihedral angles. The calculations used a total of 481 distance constraints and 69 dihedral angle constraints (Figure 3) to produce 12 converged structures (Figure 4). Structures were classified as converged if they were consistent with the NMR data and maintained correct stereochemistry. The converged structures had an average of 12 distance constraint violations between 0.1 and 0.3 Å, most of these involving the loop region. All converged structures violated less than three NOE constraints by more than 0.3 Å and none by more than 0.4 Å, and when the structures were arranged in order of increasing overall energy, the converged structures formed a plateau with similarly low overall and constraint violation energies (30). The convergence rate was very sensitive to the initial strength with which repulsive van der Waals forces were first introduced. To achieve a 25% convergence rate, van der Waals forces had to be introduced more slowly than in other protocols (30). In addition to the converged structures, the calculations produced a second class of structures that had either A6 or A7 unstacked from the helix and positioned in the minor groove. These structures were not classified as converged since A6 and A7 give rise to only one set of chemical shifts, and it is unlikely that such dissimilar structures could exchange rapidly on the chemical shift time scale. The heavy atoms of all 21 nucleotides of the final converged structures superimpose on the average structure with an average RMSD of 2.00 Å, consistent with

observations from other studies (30) that NMR methods define the long-range structure (such as bending) of helical RNAs with less precision than they define local structure. Additional structure calculation statistics are provided in Tables 1 and 2. Structure of the Loop Region. The abundance of distance constraints in the loop region (residues G9-C14) defines the conformation of these nucleotides very precisely (Figure 3 and Table 2), and several of the structurally important NOEs in the loop involve the adenine H2 resonances. NOEs from A10 H2 sequentially to U11 H1 and across the strand to C14 H1 and C14 NH2 indicate that the A10 base stacks on top of the G9,C14 base pair in a largely A-form geometry. NOEs from A13 H2 to U11 H5 and H5 indicate that the A13 base points into the helix, but no NOEs could be identified that support stacking of A13 on the G9,C14 base pair. Unusual interresidue sugar-to-sugar NOEs also play a key role in defining the structure of the loop. These include NOEs from U12 H4 to U11 H5 and H5, from A13 H3 to C14 H5/H5, and exceptionally strong NOEs from A10 H2 to U11 H5 and H5. These NOEs indicate that the sugar rings of the loop pack together tightly in an arrangement distinctly different from standard helices. Several nucleotides in the loop have unusual sugarphosphate backbone conformations. The large H1-H2

a RMSDs represent the average deviation between individual minimized structures and the average structure (heavy atoms only). Local structural features are precisely defined by NMR data, but long-range structural features (such as bending) are less well defined (30).

couplings of residues U11, U12, and A13 indicate that their ribose sugar rings occupy the C2-endo conformation, and the >5 Hz P-C2 coupling of residue U11 indicates that its -backbone angle occupies the nonstandard gauche- conformation. The -angle of A13 adopts the trans conformation associated with A-form geometry, and that of U12 was constrained to include trans and gauche- conformations but is trans in all converged structures (Figure 5). H4-H5/ H5 couplings of >5 Hz in the DQF-COSY spectrum and H4-H5/H5 cross-peaks of unequal intensity in the 75 ms 3D NOESY spectrum indicate that residues A13 and U12 have nonstandard -backbone angles. These angles were constrained to include both the trans and gauche- conformations but occupy the trans range in all converged structures (Figure 5). A nonstandard trans conformation for the R- and -backbone angles is predicted to cause a downfield shift of the corresponding 31P resonance (33). Since the 31P resonances of RNA I all cluster around -4.0 ppm, it is unlikely any of these angles adopt the trans conformation. The R-,

Smith and Nikonowicz helices. There are also cross-strand NOEs between A17 H2 and A6 H1 and between A6 H2 and A17 H1, indicating that the A6 base stacks into the helix on top of the U5,A17 base pair. The A7 H2 has a cross-strand NOE to U16 H1, indicating that it stacks into the helix as well, but it also has unusual long-range NOE cross-peaks to the A17 H1 and U16 H2 resonances (Figure 2) that suggest A7 may be partially displaced toward the minor groove. Nevertheless, the pattern of intra- and interresidue H6/8-H1 and H6/8-H2 NOEs in the bulge region does not significantly differ from that observed in the surrounding stem regions. The sugar and phosphate backbone torsion angles in the bulge region also lie within the limits of A-form RNA helices, with only a few exceptions (Figure 5). The H1H2 coupling constant of A6 is 4.7 Hz, intermediate between the values characteristic of C3-endo or C2-endo sugar conformations, suggesting that the A6 sugar is in dynamic equilibrium. H1-H2 and H3-H4 couplings indicate that all of the other sugars in the bulge region occupy the 3-endo conformation. In addition, the H4-H5 and H4-H5 NOE cross-peaks of A6 or A7 (or both) are of unequal intensity in the 75 ms 3D NOESY spectrum, indicating a nonstandard conformation for the -backbone angle. Because of spectral overlap,  was left unconstrained for both of these residues. Small H4-H5/H5 couplings for the other nucleotides in the bulge region indicate that their -angles occupy the A-form gauche+ conformation. In the original calculations, the A6 sugar conformation was left unconstrained, and in all converged structures, A7  is in the trans conformation while A6  is in the normal gauche+ conformation. Because the molecular dynamics parameters only included the 3-endo sugar pucker as a low-energy conformation, a second set of structures was calculated using explicit 2-endo constraints. In these calculations, all converged structures have both -angles trans. P-C2 couplings indicate that the -angles of U5, A6, A7, and C15 occupy the A-form trans conformation. The other -angles in the bulge region were constrained to include both the trans and gauche- conformations, but these angles are trans in all of the converged structures. Although the lack of downfieldshifted 31P resonances in RNA I suggests that none of the R- or -angles occupy the trans conformation, these angles in the bulge region were left unconstrained in the calculations and adopt the A-form gauche- conformation in all converged structures, except for A7 R, which adopts the gauche+ conformation. All of the -backbone angles in the bulge region were also left unconstrained and occupy the A-form trans conformation in all converged structures. Although the U16 NH resonance has no NOEs that would permit the direct identification of a base pair partner, the U16 NH nitrogen and hydrogen nuclei resonate near those of U5 in the downfield region of the spectrum characteristic of Watson-Crick A,U base pairs. To identify the nature of this base pair, three sets of structures were calculated: one without any base pair constraints involving U16, one with A6,U16 base pair constraints, and one with A7,U16 base pair constraints. None of the converged structures violated any of the bulge region distance constraints by more than 0.3 Å or any bulge region dihedral angle constraints by more than 0.5°, indicating that the available NOE and coupling constant data are consistent with both possible base pairs. Figure 7

-, and -angles were left unconstrained for loop residues A10-C14. In the converged structures, these angles tend to cluster into a few distinct conformations (Figure 5). All scalar coupling measurements indicate a standard A-form geometry for the sugar rings and the - and -backbone angles of residues G9, A10, and C14. A superposition of the loop regions from the 12 converged structures is shown in Figure 4 and the minimized average structure is shown in Figure 6. The helical base stack continues up the 5-side of the loop, with U11 stacking on top of A10, which in turn stacks on top of the G9,C14 base pair. Residues U12 and A13, however, do not participate in either the 5- or 3-base stack. The U12 base points out into solution, while the A13 base fits under the U12 sugar, pointed at A10 but twisted 60° relative to the plane of its base. None of the 2-OH resonances were observed in any spectra, but the 2-OH groups of U11, U12, and A13 point into the major groove in all converged structures. Structure of the Bulge Region. Many of the exchangeable resonances in the bulge region (residues U5-G8 and C15A17) are weak or not observable due to broadening caused by mobility or exchange with solvent, including the NH resonance of G8 and the NH2 resonances of A6, A7, and C15. In addition, the U16 NH resonance has no observable crosspeaks in 2D NOESY spectra, preventing the direct identification of an A6,U16 or A7,U16 base pair. Because no distance constraints could be obtained for these exchangeable protons, most of the key NOE interactions that define the structure of the bulge involve the adenine H2 resonances. All three adenines in the bulge region (A6, A7, and A17) have the weak sequential H2i to H1 NOEs typical of A-form RNA i+1

FIGURE 6: Stereoview of the minimized average structure of the hairpin RNA I. Nucleotides that are specifically required for Ms2 coat protein binding are colored white. The sugar-phosphate backbone is not distorted in the bulge region and the 2-OH of A7, the branchpoint nucleotide, is not unusually positioned within the helix. In the loop, A10 stacks on the G9,C14 base pair and U11 stacks on top of A10. Although A13 points into the helix, there is no evidence of hydrogen bonds between A10 and A13 at pH 6.7.

FIGURE 7: Stereoview superposition of the bulge regions of the minimized average structures from calculations with different base pair constraints (dashed lines) involving U16: no base pair constraints (red), A6,U16 base pair constraints (green), and A7,U16 base pair constraints (white). The view is into the minor groove. All three structures equally satisfy the experimental NMR data.

shows a superposition of the bulge regions of the minimized average structures from each of the three sets of calculations. In the absence of base pair constraints, both A6 and A7 are stacked into the helix. The base of U16 is coplanar with A7 but is slightly displaced from the normal Watson-Crick orientation toward the major groove in a geometry similar to a G,U wobble pair. The U16 NH proton is not in a position to form a hydrogen bond with A6 N1, A7 N1, or any other nitrogen atom acceptor. When base pair constraints are included in the calculations, U16 is no longer oriented toward the major groove and can form a base pair of standard geometry with either A6 or A7 without significant additional NOE violations. In all of the calculated structures, the base of A7 is pointed toward the minor groove, consistent with the observed NOEs. The greatest difference between the three structures is the orientation of the U16 base. The bulge region of the average structure generated without base pair constraints superimposes on the average structures generated using A6,U16 and A7,U16 base pair constraints with RMSDs

of 0.62 and 0.92 Å, respectively. In the absence of constraints on the A6 sugar conformation, the 2-OH groups of all residues in the bulge region point into the minor groove like those of the stem. When the A6 sugar is constrained to the 2-endo conformation, the A6 2-OH group points at A7 O4 and is less accessible to solvent from the minor groove. The geometry of the A6, A7, and U16 bases, however, do not appear to change significantly. Protonation of A7 and the Identification of an A6,U16 Base Pair. The C2H2 correlations of A6 and A7 are weak in HMQC spectra and are broadened in the 1H and 13C dimensions, respectively (Figure 8). The chemical shift of A7 C2 is strongly pH dependent, ranging from 153.8 ppm at pH 7.1 to 147.6 ppm at pH 5.45, indicating that the purine ring is being protonated at its N1 position with a pKa  6.1. A13 has a somewhat elevated pKa of 5.4, but A6, A11, and A17 have pKa values of <5.0. A high pKa does not indicate by itself, though, that an adenine bulges at neutral pH. At low pH, the 1H and 15N

FIGURE 8: HMQC spectra at high and low pH showing (A) the C2-H2 region and (B) the NH region. The H2 resonance from residue A6 is slightly broadened due to conformational flexibility at pH 6.7. As the pH is decreased, the C2 of A7 migrates 6 ppm upfield, indicating that its N1 position protonates with a pKa of 6.1. The lack of change in the U16 NH resonance indicates that the A6,U16 base pair is the major conformation at pH 6.7. A13 has the second highest pKa, is partially protonated at pH 5.5, and is in intermediate exchange. The G9 NH shifts downfield and intensifies at low pH, possibly due to formation of an A10-A13 hydrogen bond. Minor conformations of the G2 and U5 NH resonances are indicated (*) in panel B.

chemical shifts of the U16 NH resonance change only slightly and remain in the region characteristic of Watson-Crick A, U base pairs (Figure 8). Since protonated adenines cannot form standard A,U base pairs, at low pH, the base pair partner of U16 must be A6. If the U16 was rapidly exchanging between the A6 and A7 base pairs at pH 6.8, its NH chemical shifts would be the weighted average of these states. The lack of significant change of the U16 NH chemical shifts with pH suggests, then, that the A6,U16 base pair and A7 bulge is the major conformation at pH 6.8. To account for the stabilization of the protonated adenine, we propose a model in which the A6,U16 base pair forms an additional hydrogen bond between U16 O2 and A7 NH+, analogous to those seen in AH+,C base pairs (37, 38). This model was tested by calculating a set of structures using explicit hydrogen bond constraints between A6, A7, and U16. None of the calculated structures violated any bulge region

distance constraint by more than 0.3 Å or any bulge region dihedral angle constraints by more than 0.5°, indicating that the model is consistent with the available NMR data. All NOEs predicted by the model were confirmed except for those obscured by resonance boadening or spectral overlap. A converged structure from these calculations is shown in Figure 9. In the Watson-Crick A,U region of HMQC spectra, there is an additional unassigned uridine NH correlation that is distinct but weak (5% the intensity of other NH resonances). Since none of the loop uridines are in a position to form base pairs, it is likely that there are minor conformations in the bulge region that persist even at low pH. Weak additional C2H2 and C8H8 correlations are also present at pH 6.8 in HMQC spectra near the resonances of adenines in the bulge region, but these have not been assigned. 13C Relaxation Measurements. The reorientation of a 13C1H bond vector on the picosecond time scale can be assessed through its carbon T1F relaxation: the longer the relaxation time, the more mobile the 13C-1H pair (39). The T1F relaxation times for the base 6/8 and ribose 1-carbon positions are listed in Table 3. The A13 C8 resonance has a relaxation time of 75 ms, while the other guanine and adenine resonances have relaxation times of 38-50 ms. The C6 relaxation times of the pyrimidines are between 41 and 48 ms, except for those of U11 and U12 which are, respectively, 56 and 78 ms. Loop nucleotides U11 and U12 also have the

A6 and U16 (green) form a Watson-Crick base pair with a propellar twist of 30°. The A7 NH+ group forms a hydrogen bond with the O2 of U16 and stabilizes the A7NH+. The distance between A7 N1 and U16 O2 is 2.7 Å.

NMR Structure and Dynamics of a Bulged RNA Motif longest C1 T1F values, 72 and 77 ms, respectively, followed by that of the 3-terminal nucleotide at 68 ms. The increased mobilities of residues U11, U12, and A13 indicated by their long relaxation times are consistent with the decreased stacking in the 3-portion of the loop. The C8 and C1 relaxation times of A6 and A7 and the C1 relaxation time of U16 are comparable to those of other nucleotides in the stem that participate in Watson-Crick or G,U wobble base pairs, indicating that the bulge region is not especially dynamic on the picosecond time scale and suggesting that the structure of the bulge is stable. Ms2 Coat Protein Dimer Binds RNA I Specifically. Since there has been no study of the binding affinity of RNA I for phage GA or Ms2 coat protein, there is the formal possibility that the hairpin does not bind or does so nonspecifically. To better understand our results in terms of their implications for the coat protein-RNA complex, we performed binding competition experiments to assess the binding specificity of Ms2 coat protein for RNA I. Figure 10A shows the NH region of 15N-1H HMQC spectra of RNA I, in the presence of a 1:1 mixture of RNA I and Ms2 coat protein dimer. In the presence of the coat protein, Figure 10B, the U5 NH resonance shifts downfield in both the 15N and 1H dimensions, while the U16 NH resonance shifts upfield in both dimensions and becomes more intense. Two additional NH correlations appear that have been tentatively assigned to U11 and G8. The NH resonances of the stem do not noticeably change in position or intensity. Figure 10, panels C and D, shows the NH spectra of the RNA I-Ms2 coat protein mixture in the presence of noncompetitor and competitor RNA hairpins, respectively. Peaks in these spectra correspond only to RNA I since neither the competitor nor noncompetitor hairpins are 15N enriched. The addition of an equal molar amount of noncompetitor hairpin lacking the sequence elements necessary for coat protein binding produces no change in the spectrum. The addition of a half mole ratio of competitor hairpin containing a phage Ms2 coat protein-binding site, however, results in a weakening of the protein bound U5 and U16 resonances and a reappearance of the U5 resonance from the free RNA I. These results indicate that the changes in the NMR spectra of RNA I caused by the addition of Ms2 coat protein result from the formation of a specific RNA-protein bound complex. Furthermore, the lack of change in the stem NH resonances upon binding is consistent with a bound RNA conformation essentially the same as that observed in X-ray crystal structures of the Ms2 protein-RNA complex (40). DISCUSSION The coliphage Ms2 and GA coat protein dimers bind RNA hairpins composed of four-nucleotide loops and stems containing single bulged adenine bases. The position of the unpaired base relative to the hairpin loop is important for binding since the coat protein forms specific contacts to both elements (40, 41). Bulged nucleotides also play a pivotal role in the splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA transcripts and group II introns (2, 3, 11). Although the spliceosome employs a variety of protein and RNA factors to accomplish this complex task accurately and efficienciently, the principal catalytic steps are likely to be RNA mediated. The structure and dynamics of the RNA hairpin investigated here suggest

a common pathway for the formation of active complexes involving the (A-A),U bulge motif. Structure of the RNA Hairpin Loop. Despite many unusual non-A-form structural characteristics, the AUUA hairpin tetraloop has a very defined tertiary structure (Figure 6). The 5-base stack continues into the loop, with the A10 base stacking on the G9,C14 base pair in a normal A-form conformation, while the U11 base stacks on A10. The U12 base does not stack at all but instead points out into solution approximately along the helix axis. The A13 base points into the helix but has a propeller twist of 60° relative to the base of A10 and does not appear to stack on the G9,C14 base pair. Since there is no spectral evidence for any of the proposed hydrogen bonds between the bases of A10 and A13 (42), the preciseness of the structure calculations suggests

13496 Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 39, 1998 that the loop may be effectively stabilized by stacking and hydrophobic interactions alone. The long T1F relaxation times of the U11, U12, and A13 C6/8 and C1 atoms (Table 3) indicate that these residues are very mobile on the picosecond time scale and may occupy a greater region of space than indicated by the structure calculations (Figure 4A). However, the T1F relaxation times do not provide direct information on the amplitudes of the nucleotide motions, which may be small. Nevertheless, local conformational mobility on the 3-side of the loop is consistent the broadness of the C14 H1 resonance and the lack of NOEs between five pairs of atoms involving A13 that are consistently <5.0 Å apart in converged structures. The overall structure of the loop is similar to that of the Ms2 variant AUCA loop reported by Borer and co-workers (9, 42). Structure of the Adenine Bulge. The stem of RNA I contains a distinctive structural motif: two adjacent adenine nucleotides on one strand and a single uridine nucleotide on the complementary strand. In principle, this (A-A),U motif can adopt either of two secondary structures, the A6,U16 or the A7,U16 base pair, but the spectral data indicate that the A6,U16 base pair is the predominant form below pH 7. Importantly, the experimental NOE constraints do not restrict this region to a unique secondary structure. Indeed, the use of explicit A6,U16 or A7,U16 base pair constraints in the refinement procedure resulted in structures that equally satisfied all experimental distance and dihedral angle constraints (Figure 7). The secondary structure of the bulge region is largely revealed by the protonation of A7 at an unusually high pH. Protonated adenines have been identified in RNA molecules, but typically these bases participate in noncanonical AH+, C base pairs (37, 38). The cytidine stabilizes the protonated form of the adenine base by providing a hydrogen bond acceptor, resulting in an increase of the adenine pKa. The positions of A7 and U16 suggest a tertiary interaction that may facilitate protonation of the A7 base. The O2 of U16 points into the minor groove when the A6 and U16 nucleotides form a Watson-Crick base pair. The NH nitrogen of A7 points toward the major groove face of the A6,U16 base pair, allowing the A7 NH+ to form a hydrogen bond to the U16 O2. The A7-U16 interaction is analogous to that found in the AH+,C base pair scheme where the NH proton of AH+ forms a hydrogen bond to the cytidine O2. It is unlikely that the high pKa of A7 is simply due to its lack of a base pair partner, since a single unpaired adenine flanked by G, C base pairs has a pKa 0.7 units lower than that of A7 here (data not shown). While nucleotides A7 and U16 are not excluded from adopting a Watson-Crick base pair near neutral pH, the orientation of the A6 base within the helix does not permit the formation of additional stabilizing interactions beyond the stacking of the A6 base into the helix. This model (Figure 9) is consistent with all of the available NMR data. Comparison to Other Bulge-Containing Stems. Single and multiple bulged bases are a recurring theme in RNA secondary structures. Structural investigations of single bulged nucleotides in RNA suggest that the conformation adopted is dependent upon the nature of the base pairs of the flanking helices. A single bulged adenine flanked by Watson-Crick base-paired G and C residues adopts the expected intrahelical stacked conformation (9), but a bulged

Smith and Nikonowicz adenine flanked on one side by a non-Watson-Crick base pair adopts an extra-helical conformation and occupies the minor groove (10). Comparative analysis studies reveal the presence of (A-A),U motifs in 16S and 23S rRNAs, but do not suggest that a common A,U base pair scheme exists (43). The phylogenetically conserved internal loop of the RNA-binding site for ribosomal protein S8 contains the (A-A),U motif flanked by G,C and U,G base pairs in addition to two Mg2+-binding sites. In this context, the 5proximal adenine base is extrahelical and forms a hydrogen bond to the 3-proximal adenine which participates in the A,U base pair (44). This differs from the structure presented here in which both adenine bases are intrahelical and the 5-adenine preferentially forms the A,U base pair. A characteristic feature of the 31P spectra of DNA duplexes containing unpaired bases is the downfield shift of a resonance corresponding to a position proximal to the bulged base (5, 6). Interestingly, all the phosphorus nuclei proximal to A6 and A7 resonate in the center of the cluster of 31P peaks. The -torsion angle of A7 may alleviate any strain on the backbone imposed by the bulged nucleotide and thus permit the R- and -torsion angles to adopt the preferred gauche configurations. Significance of the (A-A),U Bulge for the Branch-Point Helix. The first transesterification reaction in the splicing of introns out of pre-mRNA involves the nucleophilic attack of the phosphate at the 5-splice site by the 2-OH of a bulged adenine within the (A-A),U motif of the branch-point helix (12). The (A-A),U motif of RNA I is flanked on the 3side by a G,C base pair, but the conserved sequences of yeast and mammalian pre-mRNAs have a C,G pair at this site (Figure 1). While this substitution interferes with spliceosomal assembly events prior to the formation of the branchpoint helix, it still allows accurate splicing and does not appear to affect the first catalytic step (45). The structure of RNA I, then, is likely to be representative of the free branch-point helix. It has been proposed that the pairing of U2 snRNA with the branch-point region of pre-mRNA selectively bulges the branch-point nucleotide and aligns the 2-OH of that nucleotide with the phosphodiester bond at the 5-splice site (3). Our study of the (A-A),U motif found in branch-point helices indicates that the 3-proximal adenine does in fact preferentially bulge in the free RNA, consistent with the known preference of the branch-point nucleotide in yeast and mammals (3, 46). The 2-OH of the bulged adenine, however, adopts a standard geometry and points into the minor groove like all of the other base-paired residues. The sugar-phosphate backbone of the bulge region is also very regular, with the only departures from normal A-form geometry being the trans conformation of the bulged adenine -backbone angle and the mixture of C2-endo and C3-endo conformations in the 5-proximal adenine ribose sugar ring. Since the conformational differences between the (A-A),U motif and a regular A-form helix are minor, it is likely that the presentation of the bulged 2-OH to the phosphate at the 5-splice site requires a local structural rearrangement. Such rearrangement could be assisted by a protein which binds to the branch-point helix and allows the branch-point adenine sugar to loop out from the helix, analogous to the rearrangement that occurs with binding of the Ms2 coat protein to its RNA operator sequence (40). Indeed, photo-

NMR Structure and Dynamics of a Bulged RNA Motif chemical cross-link studies have identified proteins that associate with the branch-point helix within the spliceosome (reviewed in ref 47). This looped out conformation would permit the close approach of the 5-splice site by extending the 2-OH away from the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the branch-point helix. Alternatively, the mechanistic similarities between pre-mRNA processing within the spliceosome and the self-splicing of group II introns suggest that rearrangement could be assisted by RNA factors that would allow a more conservative movement, such as destacking of the bulged base out of the helix into the minor groove. Such RNA factors could include the helices formed by the pairing between U6 and U2 snRNA or between U6 snRNA and the 5-splice site, both of which are close to the branch-point helix in the catalytic core of the spliceosome (46). In yeast, only the 3-site of the (A-A),U motif can be used as a branch-point residue, while in mammals, either site can be used but the 3-site is preferred (3). The existence of protein or RNA factors that assist conformational rearrangement of the branch-point helix could explain these differences, in a manner analogous to the (still poorly understood) way that Ms2 coat protein will only bind bulged adenines at the 3-site of the (A-A),U motif, while GA coat protein can bind bulged adenines at either site but binds the 3-site with greater affinity (17). In this view, the branchpoint helix selects the branch-point residue by bulging it in the free RNA and thus predisposing it to the protein- or RNA-assisted conformational rearrangements likely to be required for the first catalytic step of splicing. Significance of the Structure of RNA I for the Ms2 Protein-RNA Complex. Comparison of the free and proteinbound structures of the Ms2 AUUA tetraloop reveals that significant conformational rearrangement must take place upon binding. In the crystal structure of the capsid-RNA complex, the base of A13 points out of the helix into the coat protein, U12 stacks on top of A10, and U11 lies in the minor groove (40). This bound conformation requires that the base that stacks on A10 switch from U11 in the free RNA to U12 in the complex, although the position and sugarphosphate backbone geometry of A10 remains largely unperturbed. In both the free and protein-bound states, the ribose rings of loop nucleotides U11, U12, and A13 adopt the C2-endo conformation. The 2-OH of U12, the only ribose functional group that participates in a direct hydrogen bond to the protein, is pointed toward the major groove in both the free and bound conformations. The coat protein also recognizes the phosphate backbone in binding and makes direct hydrogen bond contacts to phosphoryl oxygens 5 to A10, U12, and A13. The experimentally determined -backbone torsion angles of U12, A13, and C14 and the -backbone angle of A13 are different in the free RNA from those observed in the structure of the protein bound RNA. The loop nucleotides that undergo major conformational change, residues U11, U12, and A13, are also quite mobile on the picosecond time scale, presumably facilitating their structural rearrangement. The fast dynamics of A6 and A7, however, do not indicate that either base is poised to loop out of the helix. In addition, the functional groups of the loop nucleotides that form direct protein contacts are exposed in the free RNA while those of A6 or A7 that would form direct protein contacts are buried

Biochemistry, Vol. 37, No. 39, 1998 13497 deep in the major groove (Figure 6). Protonation of A7 would be expected to inhibit complex formation by stabilizing the A7-U16 interaction and preventing specific proteinbase contacts, but the effect of pH on the affinity of GA coat protein-RNA binding is smallsa factor of 4 less at pH 5 than at pH 7 (17). These observations suggest that the first step of complex formation is recognition and conformational rearrangement of the hairpin loop. The process of rearrangement in the loop or the structure of the bound loop itself may then destabilize the stem and initiate destacking of the bulged adenine. This mechanism is supported by the observation that the poorly ordered AAAA four nucleotide loop native to phage GA destabilizes the upper portion of the hairpin stem (E. DeJong, and E.P.N., unpublished data). Thus, the 3-proximal bulged adenine is predisposed to protein-induced conformational rearrangement and is therefore likely to be preferentially associated with phage GA coat protein. CONCLUSIONS Our study of the RNA secondary structure motif (A-A), U indicates that the 3-proximal adenine preferentially bulges, predisposing it to structural rearrangement important for the motif's diverse functional roles in splicing of pre-mRNA and the binding of phage GA coat protein. Although the conformation of the branch-point helix in the catalytically active spliceosome is not known, the sugar-phosphate backbone geometry of the free helix is largely regular and the branch-point adenine 2-OH group does not appear uniquely positioned to carrying out the splicing reaction. The 2-OH group could be presented for attack at the 5-splice site phosphate by protein- or RNA-mediated destacking of the bulged adenine. Similarly, the formation of a phage GA coat protein-RNA complex is also expected to require a conformational rearrangement where the unpaired adenine loops out from the helix. The fast dynamic properties of the loop nucleotides that change conformation upon coat protein binding indicate that these residues are less stabilized by hydrophobic stacking or hydrogen bonds in the free RNA than are the nucleotides of the (A-A),U motif, which appear to be more rigid. Thus, the first step of complex formation is likely to be rearrangement of the loop nucleotides, which then destabilizes the stem and induces the bulged adenine to loop out. The 3 proximal adenine requires the disruption of no more than one hydrogen bond to loop out of the helix and, thus, should be the adenine favored to interact with the GA coat protein.
