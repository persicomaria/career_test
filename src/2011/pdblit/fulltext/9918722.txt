Ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) binds diverse mammalian RNases with extraordinary avidity. Here, we have investigated the structural basis for this tight binding and broad speci®city by mutational analysis of the complexes of RI with angiogenin (Ang) and RNase A (KD  0.5 fM and 43 fM, respectively). Both crystal structures are known; the interfaces are large, and the ligands dock similarly, although few of the speci®c interactions formed are analogous. Our previous mutagenesis studies focused primarily on one contact region, containing RI 434-438 and the enzymatic active site. Many single-residue replacements produced extensive losses of binding energy (2.3-5.9 kcal/mol), suggesting that this region constitutes a ``hot spot'' in both cases. We have now explored the roles of most of the remaining RI residues that interact with Ang and/or RNase A. One major cluster in each complex lies in a Trp-rich area of RI, containing Trp261, Trp263, Trp318, and Trp375. Although the energy losses from individual replacements in this portion of the Ang complex were small-to-moderate (0-1.5 kcal/mol), the changes from multiple substitutions were much greater than additive, and the binding energy provided by this region is estimated to be $6 kcal/ mol (30 % of total). Effects of replacing combinations of hot spot components had also been found to be superadditive, and this negative cooperativity is now shown to extend to the neighboring contact residue RI Ser460. The overall contribution of the hot spot, taking superadditivity into account, is then $14-15 kcal/mol. The hot spot and Trp-rich regions, although spatially well separated, are themselves functionally linked. No other parts of the RI-Ang interface appear to be energetically important. Binding of RNase A is more sensitive to substitutions throughout the interface, with free energy losses 5 1 kcal/mol produced by nearly all replacements examined, so that the sum of losses greatly exceeds the binding energy of the complex. This discrepancy can be explained, in part, by positive cooperativity, as evident from the subadditive effects observed when combinations of residues in either the hot spot or Trp-rich region are replaced. These ®ndings suggest that the binding energy may be more widely distributed in the RNase A complex than in the Ang complex.

RNase Inhibitor Interactions

Introduction
RNase inhibitor (RI), a 50 kDa leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein, binds diverse $14 kDa proteins in the pancreatic RNase superfamily with dissociation constants extending from 10À13 M to below 10À15 M (Lee et al., 1989b; Vicentini et al., 1990; Shapiro & Vallee, 1991; Boix et al., 1996; Hofsteenge, 1997). The molecular basis for this extraordinarily high af®nity and broad speci®city has been explored in some detail in recent years by X-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis. Crystal structures have been determined for the complexes of porcine RI (pRI) with bovine pancreatic RNase A (KD  67 fM (Vicentini et al., 1990)) (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1995) and human RI (hRI) with human angiogenin (Ang) (KD < 1 fM (Lee et al., 1989b)) (Papageorgiou et al., 1997), a ribonucleolytic enzyme that induces formation of new blood vessels (Fett et al., 1985; Shapiro et al., 1986). In both cases, RI utilizes its ``horseshoe'' shape, formed by symmetrical arrangement of the 16 homologous tandem LRR units that comprise nearly the entire molecule (Figure 1), to partially engulf its target. The contact points on RI lie within the central cavity and on the upper surface of the horseshoe, and are distributed among 12 (RNase A complex) and 13 (Ang complex) of the LRRs. Although nearly two-thirds of the inhibitor residues that interact with Ang and RNase A are the same, few of the contacts that they make are analogous. Initial studies on the effects of single-residue mutations on binding af®nity (Chen & Shapiro, 1997) suggested that the complexes of RI with Ang and RNase A both conform to the ``hot spot'' model proposed by Clackson & Wells (1995): replacements within one part of each interface decreased binding af®nity substantially, whereas substitutions of various residues in other interface regions produced much smaller changes. The locations of the putative hot spots on RI for binding Ang and RNase A are nearly identical. Both contain primarily residues on the ba loop 433-439, with additional involvement of the adjacent amino acid residue Ser460. However, the speci®c interactions formed in this region of the two complexes are largely different.
{ The RI-RNase A interactions cited throughout are those observed in the crystal structure of the pRI Á RNase A complex (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996). Except where indicated otherwise, we assume that these contacts are present also in the hRI complex; pRI and hRI bind RNase A with almost identical af®nities (Lee et al., 1989b; Vicentini et al., 1990), the sequences of the two proteins are 85 % similar (77 % identical), and only four of the contact residues on pRI are not present in the human inhibitor (all but one are conservatively replaced). The N terminus of hRI is extended by four residues with respect to pRI; there are no other insertions or deletions.

A subsequent investigation of the RI-Ang and RI-RNase A hot spots using multi-site mutagenesis revealed additional details of their functioning, including some dramatic cooperativities, which were distinctive in the two complexes (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). The losses in binding energy for the RNase A complex associated with replacing pairs of hRI residues in this site were markedly less than additive (``subadditive''), suggesting that the effects of the substitutions are partially interdependent and that the overall contribution of this region may not be as large as it seemed from the singlesite variants. In contrast, the effects of these multiple replacements on af®nity for Ang were fully additive or much greater than additive (``superadditive'', LiCata & Ackers, 1995). Superadditivity was also found in several cases when these hRI residues were substituted together with hot spot residues on Ang. Thus this region of the interface may provide even more binding energy than was ®rst apparent. Here, we have explored the roles of additional components of the hRI-Ang and hRI-RNase A interfaces, both inside and outside the hot spot, by single-site and multi-site mutagenesis. Our ®ndings, while con®rming the energetic predominance of the key region in the Ang complex identi®ed previously, demonstrate that a tryptophan-rich area, containing Trp261, Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375 of hRI and Trp89 of Ang, also makes an important contribution. Some of the residues in this part of the interface, like those in the hot spot, are shown to work cooperatively, and these two regions themselves, although well separated in the 3D structure, are functionally linked as well. The RNase A complex is sensitive to losses of contacts over a much larger portion of the interface than is the Ang complex, suggesting that the binding energy may be more widely distributed. Moreover, we ®nd that replacements of residues just outside the contact surface can also weaken af®nity for RNase A signi®cantly.

Results
Role of the C-terminal region of hRI Eight residues within the C-terminal LRR unit of RI make contact with Ang; these same amino acid residues, plus three others from this segment, interact with RNase A (Table 1).{ Previous mutagenesis studies examined the roles of four of these hRI residues (Tyr434, Asp435, Tyr437 and Ser460) in the Ang and RNase A complexes and some of the Ang residues that contact this region of hRI (Arg5, His8, Gln12, Lys40 and His114) (Lee & Vallee, 1989a; Shapiro & Vallee, 1989, 1992; Chen & Shapiro, 1997, 1999). Individual substitutions of hRI Tyr434 and Asp435, and the Ang residues Arg5 and Lys40 were shown to increase the KD for the hRIÁAng complex substantially (50 to 1300fold), whereas deletion of the C-terminal residue Ser460 of hRI and replacements of the other resi-

The orientations of the RI and ligand molecules are the same, but the ligand structures have been enlarged by 15 % with respect to the inhibitors. hRI residue numbering is used.

dues produced less extensive changes (1.6 to eightfold). All four hRI mutations greatly diminished af®nity for RNase A, by factors ranging from 84 to 23,000-fold. The effects of numerous multi-site substitutions were also determined, focusing on hRI Tyr434, Asp435 and Tyr437, and the two Ang residues (Arg5 and Lys40) that appear to interact most strongly with the inhibitor loop containing these amino acids. We have now extended these studies to investigate additional interrelationships within this por-

tion of the hRI-Ang interface and the importance of those contact residues for Ang and RNase A on the 430 to 460 segment of hRI that were not examined previously. Interactions of des(460)-hRI with the Ang variants R5A and K40G In the hRIÁAng crystal structure, hRI Ser460 lies next to the inhibitor loop 433-439 but these two C-terminal elements contact entirely different

500 sets of residues on Ang (Table 1). Their functional connection was assessed by measuring KD values for the complexes of des(460)-hRI with the Ang variants R5A and K40G, in which the two major residues that interact with the loop have been replaced. Rate constants for association (ka) and dissociation (kd) were determined as described in Materials and Methods, and KD values were calculated as kd/ka (Table 2). Formation of the wild-type (wt) hRI ÁAng complex is accompanied by a marked increase in Trp ¯uorescence; monitoring of this increase under stopped-¯ow conditions has indicated that association proceeds via a two-step mechanism in which rapid formation of a loose complex EI (dissociation constant K1) is followed by a slower isomerization to the tight complex EI* (rate constant k2) (Lee et al., 1989a).{ Values for K1 and k2 can be obtained from the dependence of 1/kobs on 1/[Ang], where kobs is the rate constant for the increase in Trp ¯uorescence and [Ang] is the concentration of Ang; the 1/kobs intercept is at 1/k2, the 1/[Ang] intercept is at À1/K1, and the slope is 1/ka, where ka ( k2/K1) is the apparent second-order rate constant of association. Binding of both R5A-Ang and K40G-Ang to des(460)-hRI produced ¯uorescence enhancements similar to that for the wt complex, and again followed a two-step mechanism. The values for ka were three- to fourfold lower, re¯ecting both increases in K1 and decreases in k2. Dissociation was affected more substantially: the half-lives of the R5A and K40G complexes were 73 and 16 minutes, respectively, versus 73 days for the wt complex. The reductions in overall af®nity (5520-fold and 18,400-fold, respectively) were 13-fold and ninefold larger than expected if the pairs of residues replaced were to function independently: i.e. the mutational effects were superadditive. The values for ÁÁÁG, representing the difference between the sum of the losses in binding free energy (ÁÁG values) for the individual replacements and the measured ÁÁG values for the double variant complexes, were À1.5 kcal/mol (R5A) and À1.3 kcal/mol (K40G). Interactions of hRI variants Q430A/V432A, W438A/S439A/E440A, R457A, and I459A with Ang and RNase A The roles of six residues on the hRI C-terminal segment 430 to 460 that contact or approach Ang and RNase A in the crystal structures of the complexes (Gln430, Val432, Trp438, Ser439, Glu440 and Ile459; Table 1) were not studied previously, and that of a seventh (Arg457) was examined only with

respect to RNase A dissociation (Chen & Shapiro, 1997). The effects of substituting these residues by Ala either singly or in groups were now determined (Table 2). Some of the replacements (those of Glu440 and Ile459) eliminate interactions with both ligands; others remove contacts with only one of them (Trp438 (Ang); Gln430, Val432, and Arg457 (RNase A)); and one (Ser439) deletes no direct interactions with either enzyme (all contacts involve main-chain atoms or CB). Q430A/V432A and R457A bound Ang with avidities similar to that of wt hRI, but their af®nities for RNase A were reduced by four- to ®vefold. Replacement of Ile459 produced threefold and 1.8-fold increases in the KD values for Ang and RNase A, respectively. The variant W438A/S439A/E440A bound 20 to 30-fold less strongly to both ligands. Role of the tryptophan-rich region of hRI Analysis of the hRI-Ang crystal structure reveals one area of extended complementarity between the surfaces of the two proteins outside the hot spot already identi®ed (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). This region includes a cluster of four tryptophan residues (Trp261, Trp263, Trp318, and Trp375), Ser289, Glu344 and Glu401, which line the inside of the hRI horseshoe from the ``9-o'clock'' to the ``12o'clock'' position (Figure 1), and residues 84 to 89 on the B4/B5 loop of Ang (Leonidas et al., 1999). The intermolecular contacts formed are two direct hydrogen bonds (linking hRI residues Ser289 and Glu344 with Gly86 and Trp89 of Ang, respectively), two water-mediated hydrogen bonds (between hRI Trp263 and Glu344, and Ang Gly86 and Trp89, respectively), and 53 van der Waals contacts (out of 113 for the entire complex) (Table 1 and Figure 2(a)). The RNase A loop segment 86 to 92 differs considerably from the corresponding residues (84 to 89) of Ang in both sequence and conformation, and its surface is less complementary to that of RI (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996; Papageorgiou et al., 1997). Four direct hydrogen bonds connect this RNase A loop with RI (Ser89, Gly88, Ser89 and Glu86 interact with Glu206, Trp261, Trp263 and Lys320, respectively); Lys91 of RNase forms a nonhydrogen-bonding ionic interaction with RI Glu287; and RNase residues Gly88, Ser90, and Lys91 make a total of 20 van der Waals contacts with Glu206, Asp232, Trp261, Trp263, Glu287 and Trp318 of RI (Table 1, Figure 2(b)). Trp375 of hRI is substituted by Cys in pRI, so the pRI ÁRNase A crystal structure does not indicate whether a Trp at this position would interact with RNase A. However, modeling of the complex of RNase A with C375W-pRI suggests that it might approach Arg39.

{ As noted by Lee et al. (1989a), the kinetic data are also consistent with an alternative mechanism in which Ang and hRI can associate to form either EI or EI* in a single step and the two complexes are not interconvertible; however, it seems more plausible that formation of the tight complex EI* would require multiple steps. The apparent second-order rate constant of association and KD value are the same for both mechanisms.

Hydrogen bonds (HB) and van der Waals interactions (VDW) are listed. Interatomic contacts are shown only for hydrogen bonds; the RI atom is listed ®rst and the Ang or R.Nase A atom second. The number of van der Waals contacts with each Ang or RNase A residue is indicated in parentheses. Reference structures are 1A4Y-PDB (hRIÁAng (Papageorgiou et al., 1997)) and 1DFJ-PDB (pRIÁRNase A (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996)). Contacts were assigned by criteria speci®ed in the respective publications, except that the donor-hydrogen-acceptor cutoff angle for hydrogen bonds in the hRIÁAng complex has been relaxed from >120  to >90  . Ê Ê Distance cutoffs were generally shorter for the hRI-Ang complex (2.0 A resolution) than for the pRIÁRNase A complex (2.5 A resolution). hRI residue numbering is used. The contacts listed for the Ang complex are those observed in molecule 1 of the non-crystallographic dimer; contacts in molecule 2 differ only for hRI Lys320, which forms one van der Waals contact with Asp41 of Ang in molecule 1, and a hydrogen bond with this residue in molecule 2. pRI Asp232, which forms two contacts with Ser89 of RNase A, is replaced by Ala in hRI and is therefore not listed. a Under the conditions used for kinetic characterization, RI Asp435 probably forms hydrogen bonds with Lys41 analogous to those with Lys40 of Ang rather than the hydrogen bond with Val43 seen in the crystal structure (see Discussion). b Ser439 of hRI is substituted by Thr in pRI. The interactions with RNase A listed are only those that could be formed by a Ser residue. c Contacts shown in brackets involve Ang or RNase A residues outside the segment 84-89/86-91. d The contacts of hRI Trp375 with RNase A are not indicated by the pRI-RNase structure, since Trp375 is substituted by Cys in pRI.

Here, we have determined the effects of replacing by Ala most of the RI residues that interact with Ang and/or RNase A in this interface region, and two of the contact residues on Ang. Preliminary data on the dissociation of the complexes of RNase A with three of these hRI variants (E287A, K320A, and E401A) were reported previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997).

Effects of single-residue Ang and hRI replacements on hRI-Ang binding affinity The interactions of the Ang variants H84A and W89A with wt hRI and of hRI variants W261A, W263A, E287A, S289A, W318A, K320A, E344A, W375A, and E401A with wt Ang were investigated.

(Previous substitutions of Ang Trp89 by Met (Chen & Shapiro, 1997) or oxindolylalanine (Lee & Vallee, 1989a) also had little effect on af®nity for RI.) The Trp ¯uorescence emission spectrum of the hRIÁW89A-Ang complex was blue-shifted by

several nanometers with respect to the sum of the spectra of the two individual components, and its maximum was only 8 % higher, compared to an increase of $50 % for the wt complex.

505 instrument, which is more precise and less susceptible to mixing artifacts than the standard ¯uorimeter. The ¯uorescence changes measured should closely approximate those for the entire association process (i.e. no signi®cant binding should occur during the mixing time) because the protein concentrations are expected to be well below K1 (see Materials and Methods). The amplitude measured with a 1:1.5 mixture of wt hRI and W318A was found to be 40 % of that obtained with wt hRI alone, and greater than tenfold larger than that with W318A alone. The ka value for the W318A complex calculated from these data is 2.0 Â 108 MÀ1 sÀ1, identical with that for the wt inhibitor. Measurements of the rate constants for complex dissociation revealed signi®cant increases for W263A (sixfold), W318A (12-fold), W375A (threefold), and E401A (threefold); values for W261A, S289A, and E344A were similar to, or lower than, that for wt hRI (Table 3). Hence the KD values for the W263A, W318A, W375A, and E401A complexes are four- to 13-fold higher than for wt inhibitor (ÁÁG  0.9-1.5 kcal/mol), and those for the other three variants are nearly unchanged. The effects of replacing two additional residues from the Trp-rich region of hRI, Glu287 and Lys320, were also determined (Table 3). Although both contact the 86-92 loop of RNase A, neither interacts with the Trp89 loop of Ang: Lys320 interacts with a residue on another segment of Ang (Asp41), whereas Glu287 does not contact Ang at all. The af®nity of E287A was indistinguishable from that of wt hRI. Binding of K320A was actually slightly tighter than for wt inhibitor, largely due to more rapid association. (As shown below, these replacements did have a signi®cant effect on RNase A binding.) Interactions of multi-residue hRI variants with Ang We investigated the additivity of mutational effects in the Trp-rich region of hRI by producing the two variants: W261A/W263A/W318A (3W) and W261A/W263A/W318A/W375A (4W). Tryptophan residues at positions 261, 263, and 318 wrap around the 85 to 87 main-chain of Ang and are in close proximity in the 3D structure (closest distances of the pairs 261/263, 261/318, and 263/ Ê 318 are 3.9, 4.5, and 7.2 A, respectively) (Table 1, Figure 2(a)). Trp375 extends this network (distance Ê to Trp318 is 3.8 A) and, like Trp318, forms numerous contacts with Pro88 and Trp89 of Ang. The Trp ¯uorescence emission of free 3W was $50 % lower than for wt hRI (Figure 3(a)), and addition of Ang produced only a small change (Figure 3(b)). Therefore, complex association was studied by using the same competition method as for W318A; the ka value measured was 2.2-fold lower than with wt hRI, although the three individual replacements had produced decreases of only 3-20 % (Table 3). Attempts to determine the kd value for the 3W ÁAng complex by the standard method used

change was too small to allow use of the stopped¯ow method for monitoring association, and the ka value was determined instead by measuring competition with RNase A in an enzymatic assay (see Materials and Methods). The effects of Trp89 modi®cations on ¯uorescence indicate that this residue, the sole Trp in Ang, is directly or indirectly responsible for the large increase in ¯uorescence upon formation of the wt complex. Therefore, it seemed likely that replacements of some of the hRI residues that interact with the Trp89 loop would alter the ¯uorescence of the complex. Such changes might have repercussions for measurements of complex association and might also provide insight into the interactions within this region. Therefore, ¯uorescence studies were performed with the hRI variants W261A, W263A, S289A, W318A, E344A, W375A, and E401A. The emission intensities of the free proteins varied considerably (Figure 3(a)), ranging from 9 % higher than that of wt hRI (E401A) to as much as 31 % lower (W263A) (all comparisons are based on emission at lmax). Binding of Ang to E401A produced a somewhat larger ¯uorescence increase (69 %) than for the wt inhibitor, whereas the enhancements were smaller for S289A (38 %), E344A (24 %), W263A (23 %), W261A (22 %), and W375A (22 %). Binding of Ang to W318A-hRI decreased emission by 12 % rather than causing an increase (Figure 3(b)). In all cases, the ¯uorescence of the complex was red-shifted with respect to that of the free inhibitor. The changes accompanying formation of the complexes of all hRI variants except for W318A were suf®cient to allow ¯uorimetric monitoring of the association process. Binding clearly followed the usual two-step mechanism (i.e. the dependence of kobs on [Ang] was hyperbolic) except with S289A, where kobs was linearly dependent on [Ang] throughout the range used. We infer from the data for S289A that K1 for this variant is at least tenfold higher than for wt hRI or that association proceeds by a single step. In either case, ka represents the slope of the plot of kobs versus [Ang]. Despite the marked change in K1 or mechanism, the ka value for S289A is only twofold lower than for wt hRI. The ka for the W375A complex was decreased similarly and the values for the other complexes were altered even less (Table 3). To measure association of W318A-hRI with Ang, a new competition method was developed based on the difference between the ¯uorescence emissions of the W318A and wt hRI complexes. In this method, a mixture of the two inhibitor forms is combined with Ang, and the proportioning of Ang between them is determined from the amplitude of the observed ¯uorescence change together with the amplitudes measured when each hRI form is combined with Ang separately. The concentrations of the free inhibitor species are then used to calculate the ka value for the variant according to the equation given in Materials and Methods. Fluorescence was monitored with the stopped-¯ow

for the single-site variants were unsuccessful because the complex dissociated almost completely during the chromatographic procedure for separation of bound and free Ang. Dissociation was followed instead by ¯uorescence: wt hRI was added to the 3W ÁAng complex, and the increase in Trp ¯uorescence as Ang dissociated from 3W and bound to wt inhibitor was measured. This change occurred over a time-span of hours and was moni-

tored by recording emission spectra periodically. The increases in ¯uorescence at multiple wavelengths during the ®rst apparent half-life were treated as ®rst-order processes; the resultant ®ts were good (average r2  0.998) and the kd value obtained was 3.07(Æ0.15) Â 10À4 sÀ1 (t1/2  38(Æ2) minutes). Therefore, the KD for the 3WÁ Ang complex is 3.4 pM. This value is 6250-fold higher than for the wt complex, whereas an increase of

507 Materials and Methods. The KD value measured was 8.7 pM, an increase of 202-fold compared to wt hRI. This change is tenfold less than the product of the KD increases for the three individual replacements; thus, the effects of the mutations on RNase A binding are subadditive (ÁÁÁG  1.4 kcal/mol), in contrast with the superadditivity found with Ang. Inter-relationship between the Trp-rich and hot spot regions in the hRI ÁAng complex The interactions of 3W-hRI with the Ang variants R5A and K40G were investigated to assess the extent to which the Trp-rich region and the hot spot containing Arg5 and Lys40 of Ang and the Cterminal segment of hRI function independently (Table 5). The kd values were calculated from the rates of increase in Trp ¯uorescence after addition of wt hRI to the complexes. Values for ka were determined by the competition method used above for the complexes of W318A and 3W with wt Ang. The KD values derived from these rate constants were about one million-fold (R5A) and ®ve million-fold (K40G) higher than for the wt complex. ÁÁÁGH , the difference between the ÁÁG value for the complex of 3W with Ang variant and the sum of ÁÁG values for the complexes of 3W with wt Ang and wt hRI with Ang variant, is À0.9 kcal/mol in both cases. Thus the effects of the 3W triple replacement and each single-residue Ang substitution are superadditive, although less so than for many of the multiresidue replacements within the two interface regions. Role of hRI Tyr150 in binding Ang Seven hRI residues outside the C-terminal and Trp-rich regions contact Ang in the crystal structure of the complex: Gln10, Cys11, Asp35, Asp36, Asn93, Tyr150 and Asn406. The ®rst four of these interact only with Arg31 or Arg32, whose roles in hRI binding were assessed previously by mutagenesis (Shapiro & Vallee, 1992). R31A-Ang had nearly the same af®nity for hRI as wt Ang, whereas R32A bound 4.6-fold less tightly. Asn93 and Asn406 of hRI each form a single van der Waals interaction with Ang; the contributions of these residues were considered likely to be small and were not investigated. The OH group of hRI Tyr150 hydrogen bonds to NH1 of Ang Arg95 and lies slightly beyond hydrogen-bonding distance from OE1 of Ang Gln93; it also forms a van der Waals contact with CD of the latter residue. The importance of this tyrosine residue was investigated by characterizing the interaction of the variant Y150A with Ang. The kd value for the complex was found to be 1.8(Æ0.2) Â 10À7 sÀ1 i.e. 1.7-fold higher than for the

108-fold would be expected if the individual replacements in¯uence activity by completely independent mechanisms: i.e. the mutational effects are superadditive, with ÁÁÁG  À 2.4 kcal/mol. The Trp ¯uorescence emission of the quadruple variant 4W was 68 % less intense than that of wt hRI (Figure 3(a)), and, as with 3W and W318A, Ang binding produced no signi®cant increase. In this case, however, we were unable to measure the ka value for technical reasons, and only kd was determined. The half-life of the complex, measured by the same procedure used for 3W, was 12 minutes, i.e. 3.2-fold faster than for the 3W ÁAng complex. This change is similar to that produced by replacing Trp375 in the context of wt hRI: thus, introduction of the fourth substitution did not reveal any superadditivity beyond that observed with 3W, and we estimate that ÁÁG for 4W is $6.2 kcal/mol (i.e. ÁÁG for 3W plus ÁÁG for W375A). Effects of hRI replacements on affinity for RNase A We investigated the interactions of RNase A with ten hRI variants containing single-residue replacements in the Trp-rich region: the nine whose binding to Ang was characterized, plus E206A (Table 4). As with wt hRI (Lee et al., 1989a), no signi®cant change in Trp ¯uorescence was observed after addition of one molar equivalent of RNase A to any of the variants. Values of ka and kd were therefore measured by standard methods based on the enzymatic activity of RNase A, and KD values were again calculated as kd/ka. All variants exhibited decreased af®nity for the enzyme, by factors ranging from 3.8-fold for S289A to 42fold for W263A (ÁÁG  0.8-2.2 kcal/mol).{ These changes re¯ected faster dissociation and, in all but three cases (E206A, W263A and W318A), slower association as well. For two of the variants, S289A and E344A, the residues replaced do not contact RNase A in the crystal structure of the complex. It is surprising that the Glu344 mutation resulted in one of the largest KD increases. The complex of RNase A with 3W was also studied. Dissociation was found to be too rapid to allow accurate quanti®cation of either kd or ka by the standard procedures, and the KD value was determined by measuring the effect of inhibitor on RNase A-catalyzed cleavage of the ¯uorescent substrate 5H -FAM-mAmArUmAmA-C7-QSYTM-7-3H . In this ultrasensitive assay, it was possible to employ an extremely low concentration of RNase A (3 pM), expected to be in the same range as KD, and a concentration of substrate well below Km; therefore the inhibition constant could be obtained directly by ®tting initial velocity data to the equation for tight-binding inhibition given in

{ Leland et al. (1998) have reported that wt hRI and the W263A variant inhibit RNase A similarly in an agarose gel-based assay measuring degradation of 16 S and 23 S rRNA. It is likely that a KD increase of the magnitude measured in our study would not have been evident in this assay.

Discussion
Basis for tight binding of hRI to angiogenin Ê The hRI ÁAng interface buries 2908 A of the solvent-accessible surface areas (ASAs) of the two proteins (Papageorgiou et al., 1997), considerably more than the average for protein-protein complexes studied thus far (Lo Conte et al., 1999). The interface residues on hRI are dispersed throughout the central cavity of the horseshoe, from Gln10 near the N terminus to Ser460 at the C terminus, and are located on the upper face of the horseshoe near the C terminus as well (Figure 1). The contact residues on Ang are drawn from the enzymatic active center and several distinct structural elements outside this site. The degree of shape complementarity between the hRI and Ang surfaces at the interface is high, in general, but is particularly impressive in two regions with concentrations of contact residues: that containing hRI residues 434 to 438 and 460 and the active site of

Ang, and that formed by tryptophan residues at positions 261, 263 and 318 of hRI and the Trp89 loop of Ang. The results shown here, in conjunction with earlier mutational data, offer a picture of the binding energetics that is both simpler and more complicated than that suggested by this analysis of the crystal structure: simpler in that key contacts are relatively few in number and are con®ned largely to one small part of the interface, and more complicated in that many contact residues function cooperatively rather than independently, even in some cases where there is no apparent structural connection between them. Energetics as revealed by single-site mutagenesis The roles of 17 of the 26 contact residues on hRI and 10 of the 24 on Ang have now been investigated in detail by mutagenesis (Figures 4(a) and 5). The various substitutions eliminate all of the 12 direct hydrogen bonds and all but four of the 113 van der Waals contacts. In only a few cases do individual replacements have a substantial impact on binding (ÁÁG > 2 kcal/mol): hRI Asp435 3 Ala (3.5 kcal/mol), hRI Tyr434 3 Ala (3.3 kcal/mol), Ang Lys40 to Gly (3.2 kcal/mol) (4.2 kcal/mol for Lys40 3 Gln (Lee & Vallee, 1989a)), and Ang Arg5 3 Ala (2.3 kcal/mol). None of the other Ang mutations decrease binding

(b) ÁÁG values for replacements of hRI residues in the hRIÁ RNase A complex, as in (a).

energy by more than 1 kcal/mol, and only three of them (substitutions of His8, Arg32 and His114) produce ÁÁG values greater than 0.5 kcal/mol. Four modi®cations of hRI (replacements of Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375 by an Ala residue and deletion of Ser460) diminish binding energy by 1-1.5 kcal/ mol, and three (substitutions of Glu401, Tyr437 and Ile459) reduce it by 0.7-0.9 kcal/mol. The others (replacements of Tyr150, Trp261, Ser289, Lys320 and Glu344) have no signi®cant effect on af®nity. These ®ndings suggest that the hRI-Ang interface contains a single energetic hot spot, formed by the hRI segment 434 to 438 and portions of the Ang active site (the catalytic residue Lys40 and Arg5), and that the contribution of this region is enhanced by interactions of the neighboring residues hRI Ser460 and Ile459 with other Ang components within (His8 and Gln12) or adjacent to (Ser37 and Pro38) the active center. The Trp-rich region of the interface (Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375 of hRI and the 84-89 loop of Ang) appears to

provide a small amount of additional binding energy, and no other areas seem to play any appreciable role. This view of the interface energetics is incomplete, however, because the effects of the singleresidue replacements do not account for the enormous free energy of complex formation, 21 kcal/ mol. The shortfall is most dramatically evident when the Ang side of the complex is considered: the sum of the ÁÁG values for the ten Ala or Gly substitutions performed (Figure 4(a)) is less than 9 kcal/mol, the sum of ÁÁG values for non-redundant hRI replacements that delete essentially all of the interactions of another 12 residues (Ser37, Pro38, Asp41, Glu67, Gly85, Gly86, Ser87, Pro88, Gln93, Arg95, Ala106 and Gln117) is about 5 kcal/ mol, and the two remaining contact residues (Arg24 and Arg121) form only one or two van der Waals interactions and are unlikely to have signi®cant roles. The sum of ÁÁG values obtained by an analogous treatment focusing on the hRI side of

Space-®lled models of hRI (left) and pRI (right) in their complexes with Ang and RNase A, respectively, with contact residues color-coded according to the loss of binding free energy upon elimination of their interactions: red, >2 kcal/mol; yellow, 1-2 kcal/mol; white, <1 kcal/mol. Cys375 of pRI has been replaced by Trp, as in hRI. The general orientations are the same as in Figure 1, but the structures have been rotated somewhat in order to better show the inner surface of the horseshoes, particularly in the C-terminal half of the molecules; residues can be identi®ed by reference to Figures 1 and 4. Most of the ÁÁG values shown are for individual Ala replacements or deletion of RI residues; the values indicated for several hRI residues (H10, C11, D35, D36, S235, and W438 (main-chain)) are based on the effects of substituting the contacts of these residues on Ang (R31, R32, R31, R32, H84, and R5, respectively) by an Ala residue, and the values for the N-terminal pRI residues Q10, C11, D35, and N89 are based on the effect of deleting the entire N-terminal segment 1 to 94. The effects of the simultaneous replacements of RI W438, S439, and E440 in the two complexes (Table 2, Figure 4) cannot be ascribed to loss of any individual residue(s) and are not indicated (see Discussion).

the complex is also 5ÁG. Moreover, the true discrepancies are even larger: the total binding energy provided by the contact residues must be higher than ÁG because ÁG also includes a generic energy penalty for the decrease in translational entropy due to association of the two protein molecules, estimated at 2.4 kcal/mol (Murphy et al., 1994; Covell & Wallqvist, 1997). It seems unlikely that contributions from watermediated hydrogen bonds can ®ll this gap. Seven of the 15 water-mediated interactions observed in the crystal structure were already eliminated by the replacements cited, preliminary results with the Ang variants Q93A and des(121-123) (R.S., unpublished data) indicate that removal of another three has little effect on af®nity, and all but one of the Ê remaining ®ve are long (53.2 A). In addition, the water molecules seen in the hRI ÁAng crystal structure do not improve the surface complementarity at the interface (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). Burying of non-contact residues is also unlikely to account for the ``missing'' binding energy. Only ®ve residues (Arg63, Glu264, Asn349 and Glu443 of hRI and Lys82 of Ang) not involved in intermolecular interactions undergo losses of ASA greater than Ê 10 A2 in the complex, and the combined decrease in hydrophobic ASA for these amino acid residues, Ê 98 A2, is 6 % of that for the complex (this calcu-

lation takes into account that only 55 % of the total ÁASA cited above is for non-polar components). Additional burying of the hydrophilic portions of these residues, only one of which forms a hydrogen bond (also present in free RI), is energetically unfavorable. Marked discrepancies between ÁG and the sum of ÁÁG values for single-site replacements have been found previously for most protein-protein complexes examined, but have usually been in the opposite direction (ÆÁÁG4ÁG) from that for the hRIÁAng interaction (see, for example, Clackson & Wells, 1995; Clackson et al., 1998; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996; Goldman et al., 1997; and Muller et al., 1998). In either case, the differences suggest that the effects of many individual mutations are not independent. Where ÆÁÁG exceeds ÁG, some of the free energy losses for the replacements may re¯ect indirect as well as direct effects. Where ÆÁÁG is less than ÁG, as for the hRIÁAng complex, some of the disruptive effects of the replacements may be offset by favorable changes in the interface. In such instances, the decreases in binding energy measured for the single-site mutations would represent underestimates of the actual contributions of the interactions eliminated. In attempting to assess whether the energetic effects of the individual replacements in the

511 medium-length, well-buried hydrogen bonds between these charged residues. Attribution of the af®nity decreases to removal of these interactions seems particularly warranted because the ÁÁG values for the hRI Á K40G-Ang, D435-hRIÁAng, and D435A-hRI Á K40G-Ang complexes are all similar (Figures 4(a) and 6). Substitution of Arg5 also eliminates two hydrogen bonds (Table 1), one well buried but long and the other partially buried but short. The side-chain of Tyr434, which forms only van der Waals contacts with Lys40, undergoes an Ê Ê ASA decrease from 112 A2 to 8 A2 in the complex, potentially explaining the large ÁÁG for Y434A. One apparent problem with this interpretation is that the effects of replacing Tyr434 and Lys40 are fully additive (Figure 6). However, modeling of the hRIÁK40G-Ang complex suggests that in fact deletion of the Lys40 side-chain has minimal impact on the extent to which Tyr434 is buried in the comÊ plex (the ASA of Tyr434 in the model is 17 A2). The mutational results also conform to the guidelines outlined in many cases where less extensive decreases in af®nity, or none at all, were measured. hRI Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375, whose replacements produce ÁÁG values of 1.0-1.5 kcal/ Ê mol, undergo 34-60 A2 reductions in hydrophobic ASA upon complex formation. Substitutions of Trp261 and Lys320 of hRI, and His84 and Glu108 of Ang barely alter af®nity; these residues form only van der Waals contacts and the changes in non-polar ASA attributable to them are quite small. In four instances (replacements of Arg31 and Arg32 on Ang, and Tyr150 and Ser289 on hRI), disruption of contacts that technically qualify as hydrogen bonds had little or no effect. For the ®rst three of these, the B-factors of one or both of the interaction partners in the crystal are high, and for the last, the angle is far from optimal. In one instance, W438A/S439A/E440A-hRI, the free energy loss (1.8 kcal/mol) seems greater than expected as a direct consequence of the mutations. The three side-chains replaced make only two van

hRIÁAng interface are ``reasonable'' in terms of the crystal structure, one is faced with a general problem: despite recent progress in the calculation of interaction energies by theoretical methods (e.g. Novotny et al. (1997) and Covell & Wallqvist (1997)), it has not yet proved possible to reliably predict the energetic contributions of interactions based purely on structural analysis. No doubt, this is partially due to the type of indirect effects under consideration here. However, it also re¯ects additional complexities of the systems being scrutinized, which include solvent as well as the proteins, and an incomplete understanding of the thermodynamics of the various interactions within the context of these systems. Despite these limitations, the results of studies with small molecules and the accumulated database of mutational effects in proteins suggest some rough guidelines that can be useful for gauging expectations. Good hydrogen bonds involving at least one charged partner have been proposed to contribute $4 kcal/mol of binding energy, with hydrogen bonds between uncharged groups providing 0.5-1.7 kcal/mol (Fersht et al., 1985). Lower energies would be anticipated when the geometry is suboptimal or the interaction is not well shielded from solvent. Another consideration is the mobility of the atoms involved: if one or both of these has a high B-factor in the crystal structure, it is doubtful that a strong interaction has actually been formed. van der Waals contacts contribute primarily through the hydrophobic effect, with estimates generally ranÊ ging from 24 to 50 cal/mol for each A2 of nonpolar ASA buried (Chothia, 1974; Nicholls et al., 1991; Vaughan et al., 1999). Examination of the hRI Á Ang interaction in light of these considerations suggests that the effects of most single-residue replacements are in accord with qualitative expectations, but that some deviate considerably. All of the ÁÁG values greater than 2 kcal/mol fall into the ®rst category. The Lys40 and Asp435 replacements eliminate two

512 der Waals interactions with Ang, and the decrease in hydrophobic ASA upon complex formation is negligible. However, deletion of the intramolecular contacts of Trp438 (hydrophobic packing against Ile414, Ile436, Met442 and Leu446) might allow the 434 to 438 segment to have greater freedom of motion, thereby diminishing the strength of its interactions with Ang. Finally, there are several examples where binding energy losses are smaller than might be anticipated. Tyr437 undergoes an even larger decrease Ê in hydrophobic ASA in the complex (from 173 A2 Ê to 31 A2) than does Tyr434, and yet the ÁÁG value for Y437A is only 0.8 kcal/mol, i.e. 2.5 kcal/mol smaller than for Y434A. Replacement of Ang Trp89 by Ala has no effect on binding, although this residue forms a well-ordered, buried hydrogen bond Ê and its hydrophobic ASA is reduced by 80 A2. In addition, the ÁÁG values of 1.3 and 0.9 kcal/mol, respectively, for des(460)-hRI and H8A-Ang are Ê perhaps out of line with the 2.8-A buried hydrogen bond between Ser460 and His8 (which is probably charged at the pH used for kinetic measurements (Lequin et al., 1997)). Role of cooperativity in the interface The free energy shortfalls, both general and speci®c, described in the preceding section can potentially be explained by the existence of negative cooperativity in the hRI ÁAng interface. We showed previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997) that many residues in the hot spot containing the 434 to 438 segment of hRI and Arg5 and Lys40 of Ang indeed exhibit this type of interrelationship (Figure 6). The KD increase for the hRI double variant Y434A/Y437A exceeded the product of the increases for Y434A and Y437A by 74fold (ÁÁÁG  À 2.5 kcal/mol). Superadditivities (ÁÁÁG  À 0.9 to À2.4 kcal/mol) were also observed when Arg5 of Ang was replaced together with Tyr434 or Asp435, and Lys40 of Ang was mutated together with Tyr437. Importantly, the magnitudes of ÁÁÁG do not decrease appreciably when a third residue is also substituted. As a consequence, the losses of binding energy for some of the triple substitutions were extremely large: 10.1 kcal/mol for Arg5/Tyr434/Asp435, 9.1 kcal/ mol for Lys40/Tyr434/Tyr437, and 8.5 kcal/mol for Arg5/Tyr434/Tyr437. We have proposed that superadditivity may arise when replacement of one residue within a pair or group strengthens the contacts of others or allows the formation of new interactions (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). This would then imply that the energetic contributions of some of these residues are greater than is apparent from the single-site variants, even in some instances where the ÁÁG value was judged reasonable in terms of the 3D structure (R5A, K40G, D435A, Y434A). Here, we have demonstrated that the functional coupling in this region of the interface extends beyond the interactions of the hRI 434 to 438 seg-

RNase Inhibitor Interactions

ment to include those of a neighboring hRI residue, Ser460 (Figure 6). The effects of deleting this amino acid and replacing either Arg5 or Lys40 on Ang were superadditive, with ÁÁÁG  À 1.3 to À1.5 kcal/mol. Ser460 is not in direct contact with Ê either Ang residue: the closest distances are 7.6 A Ê (to Arg5) and 6.2 A (Lys40). However, in each case there are triangulated contacts between the residue pairs (involving hRI Trp438 and Tyr434, respectively) that may allow changes at one site to be propagated to the other. The present study also reveals negative cooperativity in the Trp-rich region of the hRI-Ang interface (Figure 6). The increase in KD for W261A/ W263A/W318A-hRI is 60-fold greater than the product of the increases for the three single-residue variants (ÁÁÁG  À 2.4 kcal/mol). None of the residues replaced contacts any of the others, although the 261/263 and 261/318 pairs are separÊ Ê ated by only 3.9 A and 4.5 A, respectively. The observed cooperativity may re¯ect the inherent malleability of the Ang loop 84-93 and the hRI tryptophan residues, whose conformations change considerably upon complex formation, improving the complementarity of the two protein surfaces (see Kobe & Deisenhofer (1996) and Papageorgiou et al. (1997)). The ¯exibility of this region may allow it to undergo rearrangements to form new or stronger interactions when individual contact residues are mutated. An alternative explanation of the superadditivity, that the triple substitution disrupts interactions of other residues but the individual replacements did not, can be largely discounted because: (i) the effects of these replacements on af®nity for RNase A were subadditive (Table 4); (ii) the effects of the triple substitution and mutation of Trp375 appear to be fully additive; and (iii) the ÁÁG values for replacements of other residues in this region are small. The hot spot and Trp-rich regions in the hRIÁAng interface are also functionally linked, although not as strongly as some of the residues within each of them. The KD increases produced by replacing Trp261, Trp263 and Trp318 of hRI together with Arg5 or Lys40 of Ang are both approximately fourfold larger than the products of the increases for 3W-hRI and R5A-Ang or K40GAng. These couplings occur over much greater disÊ tances (19-28 A) than for the intra-regional cooperativities, and may be mediated by adjustments in the RI backbone. The N and C-terminal ends of the Ê horseshoe are >2 A farther apart in the RNase A complex than in free RI, suggesting that the structure is somewhat plastic and can adapt to maximize ligand interactions (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996). Conclusions and unanswered questions A major goal of our studies has been to explain the remarkably high af®nity between hRI and Ang. The approach taken, mutational mapping of the crystallographically observed interface, is one that

RNase Inhibitor Interactions

513 evaluate experimentally. We also note that only a small percentage of the potential functional connectivities between contact residues in the hRIÁAng complex have been investigated so far. Although we believe that the most important of these have already been explored, it is possible that unsuspected cooperativities exist and that the proposed energetic map would have to be modi®ed accordingly. Basis for tight binding of hRI to RNase A The overall docking of RNase A to RI resembles that of Ang, and the ligand forms a similar number of interactions with inhibitor residues lining the central cavity and on the upper face of the horseshoe: 18 direct hydrogen bonds or salt-links and 99 van der Waals contacts, plus at least four watermediated hydrogen bonds. Again the contacts are distributed widely over both proteins and the ASA Ê buried is large (2878 A2). The main regions of ligand and inhibitor involved are the same as in the Ang complex: i.e. the enzymatic active site and 86-91 loop of RNase A and the C-terminal segment and Trp-rich region of RI. Nonetheless, only two of the hydrogen bonds formed and <30 % of the van der Waals contacts in the two complexes are analogous, even using extremely relaxed criteria for the comparison. Moreover, the surface complementarities in the two interfaces differ in striking ways (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). The complementarity of the C-terminal region of RI (401-460) to RNase A is high over a broader region than for Ang, consistent with the greater number of RI residues (16 versus 10) and interactions (79 versus 44) involved. In addition, the surface of the Trp-rich region of RI is much less complementary to RNase A than to Ang. From this analysis, it appears that the role of the RI C-terminal region may be even more predominant in the RNase A complex than in the complex with Ang. However, as for the interaction of RI with Ang, the mutagenesis data collected here and in previous studies may undermine the simple structure-based view. Energetics in the hRI ÁRNase A interface as revealed by mutagenesis The energetic effects of replacing or deleting 24 of the 28 contact residues for RNase A on hRI have been determined so far (Figure 5). Twenty of the residues were mutated in hRI individually or in groups (Figure 4(b)), and the others (His10, Cys11, Asp35, Asn93) were eliminated in pRI by deletion of the N-terminal segment through amino acid residue 94 (Hofsteenge et al., 1991). The residues not yet examined (Asp121, Val409, Gly410 and Asp411) form a total of two hydrogen bonds and nine van der Waals contacts. Therefore, the vast majority of the RI side of the interface has been explored. In contrast, the effects of truncating only one contact residue on RNase A, Lys7, have been measured (Neumann & Hofsteenge, 1994). Leland

has been applied to many protein-protein complexes, but we have emphasized an aspect not usually examined in detail: the interrelationships between contact residues, both on the same molecule and on different molecules, including many residue pairs or groups that appear to have little functional connection in the 3D structure. The cooperativities revealed, together with those instances where mutational effects con¯ict with expectations from the 3D structure, underscore the dif®culty of rigorously assigning all the sources of binding energy in quantitative terms. Despite these complications, it is now possible to propose an accounting of the energetics within the hRI-Ang interface that yields the appropriate total amount of free energy. The sum of the ÁÁG values for non-redundant single-residue mutations that eliminate the interactions of hRI residues 434, 435, 437, 438 and 460 in the hot spot is $11 kcal/mol. The observed superadditivities indicate that the actual combined contributions of these interactions is still greater, probably by at least 3 kcal/mol. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that this part of the interface provides $14-15 kcal/mol. Another $6 kcal/mol appears to derive from the Trp-rich region. This estimate is based on the ÁÁG value for the quadruple replacement of Trp261, Trp263, Trp318 and Trp375, which includes 2.4 kcal/mol due to superadditivity, and assumes that no other hRI residues in this region contribute signi®cantly. The superadditivities of the effects of the Trp261/ Trp263/Trp318 and Arg5 or Lys40 replacements indicate that residues of one or both of these interface regions may yet provide some additional energy (1-2 kcal/mol). Elsewhere in the interface, only the interactions of Ang Arg32 with hRI appear to supply any further energy (0.9 kcal/ mol). The sum of these energies, taking into consideration the cumulative errors and subtracting the entropy penalty discussed above, is essentially equivalent to the total binding energy for the wt complex of 21 kcal/mol. Numerous questions remain to be answered. The physical bases for the cooperative effects are unknown. These may involve changes in protein conformation or solvent structure that could be illuminated by crystallographic studies on complexes of hRI and/or Ang variants. It is striking that some of the strongest functional linkages (hRI Tyr437 with hRI Tyr434 and Ang Lys40) are for Ê residues that are separated by at least 13 A and have no obvious structural connection other than that they lie on or interact with the same tetrapeptide segment of the inhibitor. Both local and global Ê (up to 17 A) responses to replacements in other protein-protein interfaces have been observed in crystal structures (local: lysozyme-antibody (Chacko et al., 1995; Ysern et al., 1994) and barnasebarstar (Vaughan et al., 1999) complexes; global: growth hormone-receptor complex (Atwell et al., 1997)). Other factors that may underlie the superadditivity, such as changes in electrostatic ®elds or protein dynamics, would be more dif®cult to

514 et al. (1998) and Suzuki et al. (1999) have enlarged interface residues 88 of RNase A and 89 of human pancreatic RNase, respectively. The extensive decreases in af®nity measured probably re¯ect the introduction of steric clashes, as intended, rather than simple loss of the interactions of the residues replaced.) The single-residue RI mutations in general reduce af®nity for RNase A much more severely than that for Ang. In ®ve cases (versus two for the Ang complex), the ÁÁG values are above 2 kcal/ mol: Tyr434 3 Ala, Asp435 3 Ala, deletion of Ser460, Tyr437 3 Ala, and Trp263 3 Ala. Another seven replacements (versus four in the Ang complex) produce free energy losses of 1-2 kcal/mol: Glu206, Trp261, Glu287, Trp318, Lys320, Trp375 and Glu401 to Ala. Indeed, only three of the ÁÁG values measured (for substitutions of Cys408 and Ile459 and deletion of residues 1 to 94) were 40.5 kcal/mol. In constructing a map of the energetics in the RI ÁRNase A interface based on these results, the problem faced is the opposite of that presented by the Ang complex. Although the effects of mutations in the C-terminal segment of RI are particularly large, replacements throughout most of the rest of the interface also diminish af®nity considerably. As a consequence, ÆÁÁG for the individual variants exceeds ÁG for the wt complex by far, 31.2 kcal/mol versus 18.2 kcal/mol. This indicates that many interface components on RI do not function independently in binding RNase A, and that the direct contributions of some of the residues replaced are lower than the energy losses measured. Such overestimates seem especially likely to have occurred for Y434A, des(460), and W438A/ S439A/E440A (ÁÁG  5.9 kcal/mol, 3.5 kcal/mol, and 2.0 kcal/mol, respectively). The hydrogen bond of Tyr434 has been shown to be unimportant (Chen & Shapiro, 1999) and the decrease in hydroÊ phobic ASA for this residue (from 73 to 6 A2) and its contact partners upon complex formation is not substantial. Ser460 forms hydrogen bonds with Lys7 and Gln11, but neither is also a charge-charge interaction, the bond with Lys7 has high solvent Ê accessibility, and that with Gln11 is long (3.3 A). The high ÁÁG value for the 438/439/440 triple variant probably re¯ects indirect effects, as proposed above for the Ang complex. The magnitudes of most other energy losses accord better with the structural observations. Replacements of Trp261 and Trp263 yield ÁÁG values of 1.3 and 2.2 kcal/mol, respectively; these residues each form one non-optimal hydrogen Ê bond and undergo moderate (37-54 A2) reductions in ASA in the complex. ÁÁG for mutation of Glu206, which deletes a partially exposed hydrogen bond, is 1 kcal/mol. Tyr437, whose replacement diminishes the binding energy by 2.6 kcal/ mol, forms two hydrogen bonds and its hydroÊ phobic ASA decreases from 102 to 6 A2 in the complex. Most of the contribution of this residue is

RNase Inhibitor Interactions

through the hydrogen bonds (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). Replacements of Lys320, Glu401, and Arg457 of hRI produce only moderate ÁÁG values, although all of these residues appear to form interactions that satisfy the distance and angle requirements for hydrogen bonds and all are also salt-links. However, in each case at least one of the contact partners is extremely ¯exible (B-facÊ tor > 90 A2). Deletion of the 1 to 94 segment of RI and replacements of Cys408 and Ile459 have little impact on af®nity. None of these structural alterations is expected to affect ÁASA signi®cantly and the putative hydrogen bonds eliminated (Asn89(RI) to Asn24(RNase) and Cys408(RI) to Lys66(RNase)) are solvent-exposed and, in the latter case, not well ordered. In the crystal structure of the pRI Á RNase A complex, Asp435 interacts with a sulfate ion and Val43 rather than with the catalytic lysine residue (Lys41) as in the hRI ÁAng complex. However, replacement of Asp435 produces equivalent losses in af®nity for RNase A and Ang (Chen & Shapiro, 1997), suggesting that in the absence of sulfate or similar anions (as in the kinetic experiments) Asp435 would form hydrogen bonds with Lys41 of RNase A. This possibility was also raised by Kobe & Deisenhofer (1996), who noted that the sulfate ion might cause other rearrangements in this part of the interface as well. The hRI ÁRNase A complex is also sensitive to changes on the periphery of the interface. The ÁÁG values for replacements of Ser289 and Glu344 were 0.8 kcal/mol and 1.6 kcal/mol, Ê respectively; these residues are 4.5-5.4 A from their nearest neighbors on RNase A, Gly86 and Lys91, and neither of them contacts any interface component on RI. Thus the structure provides no explanation for the increases in KD. Af®nity losses due to mutations of non-interface residues have been described for other protein-protein systems (e.g. see Schreiber et al., 1997; Clackson et al., 1998; and Otzen & Fersht, 1999). However, in most of these cases the replacements deleted important intramolecular interactions with contact residues or were thought to affect folding. In contrast to our ®ndings for the hRI Á RNase A complex, substitutions of four residues on the periphery of the hRIÁAng interface (Glu287, Gln430, Val432 and Ê Arg457 of hRI, which are 8.8, 3.7, 4.2 and 5.7 A, respectively, from the nearest Ang residue) had no discernible effect. Cooperativity in the hRI ÁRNase A interface The discrepancy between ÁG and ÆÁÁG for the complex of hRI with RNase A, like that for the complex with Ang, can potentially derive from cooperativity between contact residues. However, the cooperativity here would need to be positive rather than negative, so that mutation of one residue impairs the interactions of others or, approaching from the opposite direction, the interactions of one residue support those of others. The presence

RNase Inhibitor Interactions

515 tions are warranted. In the two cases where single and double variants were compared, subadditivities totaling 3.7 kcal/mol were measured, and it is likely that much of the losses for substitutions of 438, 439 and 440 are due to indirect effects. If other pairs and groups of these residues in this region are also connected, the local ``concentration'' of free energy might be reduced even further. Nonetheless, the energy losses for mutations of hRI 434, 435 and 460 are well beyond those found for replacements outside this region, and our results indicate, minimally, that the effects of some of these other substitutions are also subadditive. Therefore, it still seems reasonable to consider the C-terminal region of hRI as a major hot spot in the binding interface. A more complete understanding of the basis for tight binding between RI and RNase A must await studies on the interrelationships between additional contact residues on the two protein molecules and on the structural changes induced by the various mutations. Finally, we note that interpretive dif®culties of the type encountered here for the complexes of hRI with Ang and RNase A are not con®ned to them, but seem to pertain to many protein-protein interactions. Indeed, ÁÁG values for extensive sets of single-site mutations rarely ``add up'' correctly, and examples of functional couplings between residues on the same protein partner have been found in most protein-protein complexes where this question has been examined (e.g. Kelley & O'Connell, 1993; and Jin & Wells, 1994). Moreover, non-interacting residues on different partners have often been demonstrated to be linked, even in numerous instances where there are no direct or triangulated contacts between them (LiCata & Ackers, 1995; Schreiber & Fersht, 1995; Goldman et al., 1997).

of such effects in the hRI ÁRNase A complex has not been explored as extensively as for the Ang complex, but in all instances where the independence of mutational effects was evaluated, nonadditivities of the type anticipated were measured. We found previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997) that the losses in binding energy for replacements of the hRI residue pairs Tyr434/Asp435 and Tyr434/ Tyr437 are subadditive, by 2.4 and 1.3 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 6). This suggested that the unexpectedly large energy loss associated with the Tyr434 substitution might re¯ect indirect effects on Asp435 and Tyr437, and that part of the function of Tyr434 is to enhance the interactions of these other residues. Here, we report that the energy losses for replacements of Trp261, Trp263, and Trp318 are also subadditive, by 1.4 kcal/mol. This contrasts with the superadditive effects of these mutations on binding of Ang, but may have an analogous structural basis: the proximity of the three Trp residues in the complex (261/263, 261/318, and 263/318 Ê distances are 3.5, 4.4, and 7.4 A, respectively) and the ¯exibility of these residues and the RNase A loop with which they interact. The different types of non-additivities observed for the complexes of RI with Ang and RNase A might be a natural consequence of the evolution of the inhibitor to bind extremely tightly to multiple protein targets whose sequences are only $25-35 % identical. A requirement for broad speci®city places considerable constraints on the extent to which the interactions with any particular ligand can be optimized. Therefore, mutation of a speci®c interface residue might produce opposite effects on contacts of other residues in the RI ÁAng and RI ÁRNase A complexes: enhancing them in the ®rst case (resulting in superadditivity) by destabilizing an unfavorable conformation, while impairing them in the second (resulting in subadditivity) by destabilizing a favorable conformation. Conclusions The map of the distribution of binding energy in the hRI ÁRNase A interface suggested by the combined structural and mutational data is less satisfactory than for the Ang complex. In part, this is due to the nature and magnitude of the cooperativity in this interface, both demonstrated and implied, which undermines any efforts to correlate ÁÁG values with contributions of speci®c interactions. The sum of ÁÁG values for mutations of the four residues in the C-terminal segment of hRI that appear to play key roles, Tyr434, Asp435, Tyr437 and Ser460, is 15.6 kcal/mol. The combined energy loss for truncations of additional contact residues in this segment, Gln430, Val432, Trp438, Ser439, Glu440, Arg457 and Ile459, is another 4 kcal/mol, bringing the subtotal for this region alone to 19.6 kcal/mol (versus 20.6 kcal/mol, i.e. the sum of ÁG for the complex plus the entropy penalty). However, it is clear that several subtrac-

The RNase A substrate 5H -FAMmAmArUmAmA-C7-QSYTM-7- 3H was a generous gift from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) (FAM is 5H ,6-carboxy¯uorescein, rU is ribouridine, mA is 2H -O-methyl-riboadenosine, and QSYTM-7 (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) is a rhodamine-based ¯uorescence quencher). Sources of all other materials and procedures for protein quanti®cation are given by Chen & Shapiro (1999).

The external ¯anking primers were those listed previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1999), except with Y150A and E206A, where 5H -AACTAGTACGCAAGTTCA-3H (from the 5H -non-coding region) and the antisense strand internal primer for W318A described below were used. The internal mutagenic primers were the following, listed for each of the mutants indicated as sense oligonucleotide (numbered according to the hRI cDNA sequence (Lee et al., 1988)), followed by antisense oligonucleotide, and ®nally the replacement codon(s): Y150A, 562-586, 560-584, GCT; E206A, 730-752, 728-750, GCT; W261A, 895-918, 893-916, GCT; W263A, 901-925, 900-923, GCT; S289A, 979-1004, 977-1001, GCT; W318A, 1067-1091, 1065-1088, GCT; E344A, 1144-1169, 1143-1166, GCT; W375A and 4W, 1237-1261, 1236-1258, GCT; 3W, 889-925, 889-923, GCT for both replacement codons; Q430A/V432A, 1403-1436, 1397-1431, GCG (430), GCC (432); W438A/S439A/E440A, 1426-1460, 1420-1455, GCG (438), GCT (439), GCG (440); and I459A, 1493-1517, 1486-1510, GCT. The ®nal PCR products were digested with StuI and either P¯MI (Y150A and E206A) or EcoRI (all others) and ligated into pTRP-PRI that had been cleaved with the same enzymes. Plasmids for expression of Ang variants were generated from pAng3 (Shapiro & Vallee, 1992) by using a Quick Change kit (Stratagene). The mutagenic primers were 5H -GTTACAACTTGCAAACTTGCTGGGGGGTCCCCGTGGCCG3H and 5H -CGGCCACGGGGACCCCCCAGCAAGTTTGCAAGTTGTAAC-3H (H84A) and 5H -GCAAACTTCATG GGGGGTCCCCGGCGCCGCCATGCCAG-3H and 5H -CT GGCATGGCGGCGCCGGGGACCCCCCATGAAGTTTG C-3H (W89A); these primers also introduce a silent mutation that eliminates a BamHI site and thereby facilitates screening of transformants. Sequencing of ampli®ed regions in all cases con®rmed the presence of the intended mutations and the absence of any spurious changes. hRI and Ang variants were expressed in E. coli, puri®ed to homogeneity (as judged by SDS-PAGE), and stored as described previously (Lee & Vallee, 1990); the ®nal chromatography of all hRI variants was performed with RNase A-Sepharose. Kinetics Kinetic parameters were determined at 25  C in 0.1 M Mes (pH 6.0) containing 0.1 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA, supplemented with RNase-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) and/or DTT as listed in the references cited below. The enzymatic activity of RNase A was measured spectrophotometrically with 75 mM CpA or CpG as the substrate and 10 mg/ml of BSA (Witzel & Barnard, 1962); Ang has no detectable activity in this assay. Rate constants for dissociation of all inhibitor-ligand complexes except for those of 3W-hRI and 4W-hRI were determined by methods described in detail previously. In all of these procedures, a scavenger for free inhibitor was added to the complex, and the appearance of free ligand was followed by physical techniques or by enzymatic activity. For RNase A complexes, the scavenger was Ang and free RNase A was quanti®ed by activity toward CpA (Lee et al., 1989b). For the complexes of H84A-Ang and W89A-Ang with wt hRI and R5A-Ang with des(460)-hRI, RNase A was the scavenger and free Ang variant was quanti®ed by Mono S chromatography (Lee et al., 1989b). For the complexes of wt Ang, 14Clabeled Ang was used for initial complex formation, the scavenger was unlabeled Ang, and bound and free

RNase Inhibitor Interactions radiolabeled Ang were separated chromatographically and quanti®ed by scintillation counting (Chen & Shapiro, 1997). Dissociation of the complex of K40G-Ang with des(460)-hRI was monitored by ¯uorescence spectroscopy, with W89M-Ang as the scavenger (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). Dissociation of the complexes of Ang and Ang variants with 3W and 4W (0.1 mM) was measured by modi®cations of this ¯uorescence technique in which wt hRI is added as scavenger for free ligand and the increase in Trp ¯uorescence is monitored. In this experiment, there is an instantaneous rise in ¯uorescence due to the presence of free wt hRI, followed by a slower increase as Ang or Ang variant dissociates from the hRI variant and binds to wt inhibitor; the binding step is suf®ciently rapid that the slow ¯uorescence increase observed re¯ects only dissociation of the original complex. The scavenger was used in only approximately twofold excess because of its high ¯uorescence and calculations were based on the ®rst half-life of dissociation. For the wt Ang complexes, emission spectra were recorded every 3-20 minutes and rate constants were obtained by ®tting the readings at each of four wavelengths (345, 350, 355 and 360 nm) to a single-exponential process with SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS). The readings for the 3W complex were corrected for a slow (1 % per hour) ¯uorescence increase measured with a control sample prepared by mixing the same concentrations of wt hRI and Ang, and then adding 3W; this increase may re¯ect instrument instability or evaporation of sample. No correction was required for the 4W complex, which dissociated more quickly. Dissociation of the complexes of 3W with Ang variants was monitored continuously with a stopped-¯ow ¯uorimeter (see below), and the rate constants were again calculated by treating the data as a single-exponential process. Rate constants for association of all Ang or Ang variant complexes except for those involving W89A-Ang, W318A-hRI, or 3W-hRI were determined by using a stopped-¯ow ¯uorimeter as detailed previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1997; Lee et al., 1989a). The observed ¯uorescence change could be ®tted to a single-exponential process in all cases. Rate constants for association of the complexes of Ang with W318A-hRI and 3W-hRI and Ang variants with 3W were obtained by measuring competition between wt and variant hRI for ligand with the stopped-¯ow instrument. One syringe contained 50 nM Ang or Ang variant and the other a mixture of 50 nM wt hRI and 50-75 nM hRI variant; equal volumes were mixed and the resultant increases in Trp ¯uorescence were measured. The concentrations of bound and free wt hRI and hRI variant were then calculated from the amplitude of this increase (ÁFmix) together with the amplitudes observed when ligand was combined with wt and variant hRI separately: [wt ÁAng]/ [Ang]T  (ÁFmix À ÁFvar)/(ÁFwt À ÁFvar); [wt]F  [wt]T À [wt Á Ang]  [var Á Ang]; [var]F  [var]T À [var Á Ang], where wt and var refer to wild-type and variant hRI, respectively, and F and T denote total and free, respectively. The ka value for the variant complex was then obtained from the equation ka,var  ka,wt Á ln([var]T/ [var]F)/ln([wt]T/[wt]F). This equation (Lee et al., 1989a) is valid as long as the protein concentrations are well below K1, a condition that is expected to be satis®ed, since the K1 values for all AngÁ hRI complexes examined thus far are 5140 nM (in most instances >300 nM). A single concentration of hRI variant (yielding a 33-60 % reduction in ¯uorescence amplitude compared to that for wt hRI) was used in each experiment, and at least six replicate measurements were performed.

hRI Á Ang complex (Papageorgiou et al., 1997). Values for other RI residues in these two structures did not differ appreciably. ASAs for free Ang were computed from the Pyr1 Ang crystal structure (PDB code 1B1I (Leonidas et al., 1999)). Replacements of Ang Lys40 by Gly in the structure of the hRIÁ Ang complex and pRI Cys375 in the pRI Á RNase A complex were performed with Quanta.

Values of ka for the complexes of RNase A with hRI variants were determined from the rate constants for the corresponding Ang complexes by measuring the competition between the two ligands for inhibitor in a spectrophotometric assay of RNase A activity (Lee et al., 1989a). The value for the complex of H84A-Ang with wt hRI was determined from the rate constant for the hRI Á RNase A complex by the same procedure. KD values for all complexes except that of 3W-hRI with RNase A were calculated from the rate constants for dissociation and association (KD  kd/ka). The KD value for the 3 W Á RNase complex was determined by measuring the effect of 3W on cleavage of the substrate FAM-mAmArUmAmA-C7-QSY-7. The enzymatic reaction was followed by monitoring the ¯uorescence increase that occurs upon separation of the 5H ¯uorescent group FAM from the 3H quenching group QSY-7. This assay of RNase A activity is a minor modi®cation of the method reported by Keleman et al. (1999); a similar ¯uorescence-based assay was used previously to study the interaction of RNase A with wt pRI (Zelenko et al., 1994). The RNase A concentration employed was 3 pM, the concentration range of 3W was 15-50 pM, and substrate was 0.1 mM (well below Km). KD values were calculated by ®tting the data to the equation for tight-binding inhibition (Morrison, 1969): vi  v0 a2Et fKD  I À Et 2  4KD Et 1a2 À KD  I À Et g with SigmaPlot 4.0, where vi and v0 are initial velocities (<5 % of the reaction) in the presence and absence of inhibitor, respectively, and Et and I are the total enzyme and inhibitor concentrations, respectively. RNase A and 3W were preincubated for 15 minutes prior to addition of substrate. The ÁG values for complex formation were calculated as ÀRT lnKD. The ÁÁG values associated with amino acid replacements were calculated as ÀRTln(KD,wt/ KD,var). The ÁÁÁG values for multiple-residue variants represent the sum of ÁÁG values for the single-residue variants minus the ÁÁG value measured for the multiple-residue variant. Standard errors for KD values and free energies were calculated as described previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). Fluorescence measurements Fluorescence spectra of proteins and their complexes were measured with a Jobin Yvon-Spex FluoroMax-2 ¯uorimeter. Excitation was at 285 nm, and emission was recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Time-based acquisition of protein ¯uorescence data on this instrument and on the stopped-¯ow ¯uorimeter (Applied Photophysics) were conducted as detailed previously (Chen & Shapiro, 1999). Kinetic assays of RNase activity toward FAMmAmArUmAmA-C7-QSY-7 were performed with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm (1 nm slit) and emission wavelength of 525 nm (5 nm slit). Structural analysis and modeling ASAs were calculated with the program Quanta (MolÊ ecular Simulations) using a 1.4 A radius spherical probe. Areas reported for free RI were calculated from the free pRI crystal structure (PDB code 2BNH (Kobe & Deisenhofer, 1996)) except that the value for hRI residue Trp375, which is substituted by Cys in pRI, is for the ``free'' hRI structure obtained by removing Ang from the
