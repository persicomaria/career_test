ABSTRACT: Cdc42Hs(F28L) is a single-point mutant of Cdc42Hs, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins, that facilitates cellular transformation brought about by an increased rate of cycling between GTP and GDP [Lin, R., et al. (1997) Curr. Biol. 7, 794-797]. Dynamics studies of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP have shown increased flexibility for several residues at the nucleotide-binding site [Adams, P. D., et al. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 9968-9977]. The solution structure of Cdc42Hs-GDP (wild type) has previously been determined by NMR spectroscopy [Feltham, J. L., et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 8755-8766]. Here, we describe the solution structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP, which provides insight into the structural basis for the change in affinity for GDP. Heteronuclear NMR experiments were performed to assign resonances in the protein, and distance, hydrogen bonding, residual dipolar coupling, and dihedral angle constraints were used to calculate a set of low-energy structures using distance geometry and simulated annealing refinement protocols. The overall structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP is very similar to that of wild-type Cdc42Hs, consisting of a centrally located six-stranded -sheet structure surrounding the C-terminal R-helix [Feltham, J. L., et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 8755-8766]. In addition, the same three regions in wild-type Cdc42Hs that show structural disorder (Switch I, Switch II, and the Insert region) are disordered in F28L as well. Although the structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP is very similar to that of the wild type, interactions with the nucleotide and hydrogen bonding within the nucleotide binding site are altered, and the region surrounding L28 is substantially more disordered.

The Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, protein trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, and secretion. The proteins are controlled by cycling between the biologically active GTP1 form and the inactive GDP-bound form (1, 2). GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of the protein; however, the cycle of binding, hydrolysis, and rebinding of the nucleotide is controlled by a number of regulatory and effector proteins (3-5). The Ras proteins, especially the Rho subfamily, have been extensively investigated because of their potential roles in cell transformation. Oncogenic Ras proteins transform cells due to either a defect in GTPase activity, which leads to a terminally active state, or an increased rate of GTP-GDP cycling. In either case, the activity of downstream kinases is increased. Point

mutations in Ras that inhibit the GTPase activity (e.g., G12V and Q61L) have been implicated in several types of cancer (6-8). In addition, the F28L mutation in Cdc42Hs (a member of the Rho subfamily) results in cell transformation due to the increased rate of cycling between the active and inactive forms of the protein. The mutation-induced cell transformation by Cdc42Hs(F28L) is similar to the cell transformation induced by the Dbl oncoprotein, which also catalyzes fast nucleotide exchange in Cdc42Hs (3). Structural studies of wild-type Cdc42Hs-GDP (9) as well as H-Ras-GDP (10, 11) and Rac-GDP, another member of the Ras superfamily (12), have elucidated several wellconserved regions in these proteins. However, unique structural aspects of each of these proteins provide specificity for various effector and/or regulatory proteins. In all three cases, the bound nucleotide interacts with the same regions: P loop or loop 1 (residues 10-15), residues 116-119 (residues 115-118 in Cdc42Hs), residues 145-147 (residues 158-160 in Cdc42Hs), and F28. F28 serves as the principal stabilizer of the nucleotide via a strong interaction with the aromatic ring of the bound nucleotide (10, 13, 14). When F28 is mutated to leucine, this interaction is lost. 31P NMR studies have shown chemical shift differences in the bound phosphates in H-Ras p21(F28L) relative to wild-type H-Ras (14). In addition, Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP (15) as well as Ras(F28L) (14, 16) shows a drastic increase in the GDP dissociation rate in the F28L mutant relative to that of the wild type, suggesting that F28 is an important contributor to the stability of GDP binding. NMR dynamics studies of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP (17) have shown several differences

2578 Biochemistry, Vol. 45, No. 8, 2006 in flexibility at the nucleotide-binding site of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP relative to that of the wild type (18), while the dynamics of the remainder of the protein are not significantly altered by the mutation. In this paper, we present the solution structure of the single-point mutant Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. Analysis of the solution structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP in comparison to wild-type Cdc42Hs (9) shows that, overall, the core of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP is very similar to the wild-type structure. In the mutant protein, however, some of the regions comprising the nucleotide-binding site exhibit differences that may explain the increase in the GDP dissociation rate. Further, the regions that show the most pronounced differences in stabilizing interactions with the nucleotide correlate with the regions of the protein with the greatest changes in dynamics relative to that of the wild type (17). EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification. A Cdc42Hs construct with a C-terminal truncation (19) was used to prepare the F28L mutation. The construct was cloned into a pET-15b vector and subsequently overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Cultures (5 mL) were initially grown to saturation and used to seed 1 or 2 L cultures grown in LB broth for naturalabundance samples, and in minimal media containing 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source for 15N-labeled samples. Expression and purification proceeded as outlined previously (17). For two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments using 15Nlabeled GDP, unlabeled wild-type Cdc42Hs and Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP samples were prepared as described above except that natural-abundance NH4Cl was used, and 0.1 mM [15N]GDP was incorporated in all buffers throughout purification. Expression levels using [13C]glucose were too low to produce 15N- and 13C-labeled protein for triple-resonance and 1H-13C NOESY-HSQC experiments. NMR Spectroscopy. All protein samples were prepared in an NMR sample buffer solution containing 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM NaN3 with 8% D2O at pH 5.5 at Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP concentrations of 0.2-0.5 mM in volumes of 250 µL. NMR spectra were recorded using Varian Inova 600 and 500 MHz spectrometers. The 600 MHz spectrometer was equipped with a tripleresonance pulsed-field gradient probe and the 500 MHz spectrometer with a triple-resonance cryogenic probe. All NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C in States-TPPI mode for quadrature detection (20). Carrier frequencies for 1H and 15 N were 4.77 and 115.9 ppm, respectively. 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired on 15N-labeled Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. A 2D NOESY experiment was performed using a natural-abundance sample (in 100% D2O) to detect side chain-side chain NOE peaks for some residues with relatively isolated methyl resonances. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange was assessed by lyophilizing the sample and resuspending it in 100% D2O. A series of 1H-15N HSQC experiments were performed at 0, 5, 15, 25, and 60 min, and the decrease in the volume and eventual disappearance of 1H-15N cross-peaks were used to determine the extent of exchange of deuterons for protons. Three-dimensional (3D) 1 H-15N TOCSY-HSQC experiments were acquired with mixing times of 50 and 70 ms. 3D 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired using a mixing time of 125 ms.

Adams and Oswald NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe, version 1.6 (21). The spectra were zero-filled and then apodized using a Gaussian window function prior to Fourier transformation. After Fourier transformation, a baseline correction was applied. Spectra were visualized and analyzed using Xeasy (version 1.3.6) (22). Peaks were integrated using Peakint (N. Schaefer, Diploma Thesis, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland). The backbone proton and nitrogen assignments for Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP were reported previously (17). We were able to assign a majority of the HR, H , H, and H protons by analysis of the 1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC and 1H-15N NOESYHSQC spectra of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP overlaid with the corresponding spectra of the wild type. More than 90% of the side chain protons had similar chemical shifts. Residues in two stretches, T35-N39 (Switch I region) and G60 and R65R68 (Switch II region) in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP, were unassigned due to line broadening resulting from conformational dynamics, similar to that observed for wild-type Cdc42Hs (9). For residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements, a [15N]Cdc42(F28L)-GDP sample was partially aligned in the magnetic field (Varian Inova 500) with a nonionic liquid crystalline medium made up of 4% C12E6 [n-dodecyl hexa(ethylene glycol)] and n-hexanol (23). Alignment was verified using the quadrupolar splitting of the 2H spectrum. RDCs were determined from partially aligned and unaligned samples using TROSY experiments with the phase cycling adjusted to observe the two nitrogen components individually. Structure Calculation. 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC experiments were used to derive distance constraints. A majority of the resonances for Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP were similar to the corresponding resonances of the wild type, making the NOE assignment relatively straightforward. The volumes of several well-dispersed and isolated sequential dRN and dRN(i,j) NOE peaks (resulting from correlation within and between parallel -strands, respectively) were calibrated to the distances expected for ideal -sheets (2.2 and 3 Å, respectively). NOESY constraints were classified according to their relative strength in the NOESY spectrum (<2.4, <3.4, <4.0, and <5.5 Å). Also, 55 hydrogen bond constraints were input into the structure calculations based on H-D exchange studies by NMR, the chemical shift index (indicating R-helix or -sheet) (24, 25), and expected NOE patterns indicative of hydrogen bonding. For each hydrogen bond, the distance between the amide proton and the carbonyl oxygen for the residue was constrained to be 1.8-2.3 Å, and the amide nitrogen-carbonyl oxygen distance was constrained to be between 2.5 and 3.3 Å (9). Dihedral constraints were included for residues in R-helices and -sheets (for R-helix,  ) -80 ( 50° and  ) -20 ( 50°; for -sheet,  ) -105 ( 65° and  ) 145 ( 45°). Sixtyeight RDCs from well-resolved resonances were used as additional constraints. All constraints were input into XplorNIH (26) to calculate an ensemble of structures for the protein. The 15 "best" structures from 600 calculated structures were selected on the basis of their overall low energies and minimal constraint violations. The experimental statistics from the structure calculations are given in Table 1. The structures were visualized using Swiss PDBviewer (version 3.7) (27) and MacPyMol (28) and analyzed using AQUA (29), PROCHECK-NMR (29), and the NMR en-

The core atoms of the Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP structures are residues 3-9, 16-24, 27, 29, 41-47, 49-56, 75-85, 90-103, 108-116, 136, 139-155, and 161-177, very similar to the core atoms of the final structures of wild-type Cdc42Hs (9). Distance, hydrogen bonding, dihedral, and residual dipolar coupling restraints were used to calculate the structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. The secondary structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP was determined on the basis of analysis of H-D exchange data, Ramachandran plots of the ensemble of structures, characteristic NOE patterns for secondary structure motifs, and the chemical shift index (24, 25). There were no secondary structural differences in F28L relative to the wild type; the mutant protein also consists of a centrally located six-stranded -sheet structure surrounding the C-terminal helix of the protein (Figure 1C). Other structural features found in both the wild type and Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP included helices R3 and R4 flanking the convex surface of the -sheet, helix R1 lying perpendicular to the -sheet on the concave side of the sheets, and a short RI (Insert) helix lying adjacent to a loop connecting 4 and R3 in the protein (Figure 3C). Also consistent with the wild type are the three regions in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP that show the most structural disorder: Switch I, Switch II, and the Insert region. The disorder in Switches I and II is key to the docking of effector proteins with Cdc42Hs (18) and other Ras proteins (31). Structure of the Nucleotide-Binding Site in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. Dynamics studies have shown increased flexibility in residues of the nucleotide-binding site in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP that could affect the signaling processes of Cdc42Hs (17). The nucleotide-binding site of Cdc42Hs consists of several regions that have been described from the crystal structures of Cdc42Hs (PDB entry 1ANO) and H-Ras (31). The side chain hydroxyl group of T35, the main chain NH group of G60, and P loop residues 10-15 (GXGXXG motif) interact with the phosphates of the nucleotide. Residues 115-118 interact with one side of the guanine ring of the nucleotide, while residues 28 and 158-160 interact with the opposite side of the guanine ring. Resonances for T35 and G60 could not be assigned, presumably because they are located in the flexible Switch regions of the protein. Figure 2 shows the remaining nucleotide-binding site residues of 15 low-energy structures of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP with the core atoms of the protein superimposed. Figure 3 shows the sequence-dependent number of interresidue NOEs, the rmsds of the CR atoms, and the order parameters (17) of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP compared to that of the wild type. Because of the differences in the number of NOEs used in the wild type and F28L and the use of RDC restraints for F28L, the rmsd values are not directly comparable. For that reason, specific regions of the each protein are compared to the relatively well-defined core of the protein. The rmsd value for nucleotide-binding site residues (10-15, 28, 115-118, and 158-160) is increased 52% relative to the protein core, in comparison to a 46% increase for the corresponding residues in the wild type (Table 2), with the most striking increase in rmsd surrounding residue 28. Some flexibility in the nucleotide-binding site is expected to facilitate proper cycling of GTP to GDP in Cdc42Hs, but the increased rmsd, particularly in the region of L28, may play a role in the increased rate of nucleotide dissociation.

semble program OLDERADO (30). For Cdc42Hs(F28L)GDP, very few intermolecular NOEs were observed between GDP and the protein (except for the N1 proton of the guanine ring), making it impossible to properly constrain GDP in the protein for the structure calculations. There was also a lack of NOE data for the wild type as only two NOEs were observed between the protein and the bound nucleotide (9), one of which involved the side chain proton of F28 not expected in the mutant protein. The position of the GDP was determined starting with superimposition of the Cdc42HsGDP crystal structure onto the core CR atoms of each of the final 15 Cdc42Hs(F28L) structures, similar to that done for GDP in wild-type Cdc42Hs (9). The nucleotide was then copied into the Cdc42Hs(F28L) structure from its position in the crystal structure of wild-type Cdc42Hs. The Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP structures were energy minimized to find the most favorable positions of the nucleotide in the protein. After minimization, NOEs that were observed between the N1 proton of the nucleotide ring and various residues of the protein were used to back calculate distances between the residues and the nucleotide ring. These distances between the N1 proton of the ring and other protons were checked in the structures and found to be compatible with observed NOEs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerall Structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. We have determined the 3D solution structure of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP to characterize (1) differences in the nucleotide-binding region in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP that may be consistent with the dynamics results, (2) conformational changes outside of the nucleotide-binding site that may be involved in effector binding, and (3) changes resulting from the lost interaction between the nucleotide base and the phenyl ring of F28. A set of 15 superimposed structures of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP is shown in Figure 1A. The core of the protein [atoms in the protein as defined by OLDERADO (30) whose positions are well-defined and largely invariant across the ensemble of structures] gave an rmsd from the average structure of

All structures were superimposed on the average structure computed from the 15 structures shown in Figure 1A.

The principal stabilizing factor for the nucleotide in its binding site is F28. Studies have shown that mutation of this amino acid to leucine increases the GDP dissociation rate significantly in Ras (14, 16) and Cdc42Hs (15). An examination of this region in the crystal structure of wild-type Ras (10, 14) and Cdc42Hs (PDB entry 1AN0) shows that the phenyl ring of F28 is perpendicular to the guanine ring of the bound nucleotide and serves to stabilize the nucleotide in the binding pocket, an interaction not possible in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. The rmsd for the backbone atoms of L28 is 84% greater than that of the core of the mutant protein, whereas the difference in rmsd for F28 relative to its core in

the wild type is negligible (11%, Table 2). Dynamics studies also showed that the backbone of L28 in Cdc42Hs(F28L)GDP exhibits an increased amplitude of local motion relative to the rest of the protein (17), suggestive of conformational disorder for the L28 backbone not seen for F28 in the wild type. Additionally, the crystal structure of wild-type Cdc42Hs shows that a hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of F28 and L160 (another nucleotide-binding site residue) acts to help orient the phenyl side chain (PDB entry 1ANO). As judged from the lack of NOE cross-peaks between the side chain of L28 and L160, this interaction is lost with the F28L mutation, contributing to the diminished stability of the nucleotide in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. The P loop region (residues 10-15) interacts with the phosphate groups of the bound nucleotide. Both wild-type Cdc42Hs-GDP and Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP exhibit some conformational disorder in this region (Table 2). However, dynamics studies have suggested that the P loop residues of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP display more chemical exchange than the corresponding residues in the wild type. Also, the chemical environment of the P loop residues is different in F28L and the wild type, as suggested by significant chemical shift differences for most of these residues (17). Analysis of the wild-type NOESY spectra shows that there are several backbone NH NOEs between residues of the P loop and helix R3 (D10 NH-N92 H, D11 NH-W97 H , and G12 NH-W97 HN ) and residues 116-118. These interactions help stabilize the phosphate region of the bound nucleotide (11). Only the D11 NH-W97 H NOE is seen in the NOESY spectrum of F28L. In addition, all six residues of the P loop undergo H-D exchange in F28L, while only residues 12 and 14 exhibit H-D exchange in the wild type. In addition, hydrogen bonding networks between the backbone NH groups of residues 16-18 and the R- and -phosphate groups of the bound nucleotide evident in wild-type Cdc42Hs, which help stabilize the phosphates of the nucleotide (PDB entry 1AN0), are much weaker in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP (17). NOEs observed in wild-type Cdc42Hs between the NH groups of T17 and C18 and the H protons of Q116, a residue in another region directly interacting with the nucleotide, are weak or nonexistent in F28L. Although not obvious from the average solution structure, the apparently weaker hydrogen bonds and flexibility on the microsecond to millisecond time scale (17) may contribute to a greater degree of

The wild-type data in panels A and B were taken from ref 9 and are colored black [the Cdc42(F28L) data are colored red]. The data in panel C were from ref 17, and the wild-type data are shown with empty squares and the Cdc42Hs(F28L) data with filled squares. The gray boxes indicate the positions of the nucleotide-binding pocket, and the blue boxes indicate the positions of Switch I, Switch II, and the Insert region. The Switch I and II regions are poorly defined, and the rmsd values have been removed. The difference between the insert region of the wild type and F28L arises largely due to the unavailability of the 13C-separated NOESY experiment for F28L (see Experimental Procedures). Although still poorly defined relative to the core of the protein, the structure is somewhat more constrained in the wild type due to several long-range side chain-side chain NOEs.

conformational freedom for the nucleotide and an increased rate of dissociation. The guanine base of the nucleotide is also stabilized via interactions with residues 115-118 on the side of the nucleotide ring opposite F28 and with residues 158-160 perpendicular to the nucleotide ring on the same side of the nucleotide as F28 (PDB entry 1ANO). Studies of H-Ras have shown that the principal function of residues 116-119 (residues 115-118 in Cdc42Hs) is to provide a link between the other regions of the protein involved in nucleotide binding: the P loop residues and residues 145-147 (158160 in Cdc42Hs) (31). The chemical shifts for these residues

differ little between the wild type and F28L (17), indicating that the chemical environment is similar. Also, the dynamics parameters for these residues are similar in both the wild type and F28L (17). Likewise, little change is seen in the solution structures of the two forms of Cdc42Hs (Figure 2 and Table 2). Despite similarities between the wild type and F28L, several NOEs are observed in wild-type Cdc42Hs between the backbone NH groups of residues 115-118 and other regions that are absent in the F28L spectra (Table 3). The structure of wild-type Cdc42Hs shows that the NH group of Q116 has a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of C157 and D118 is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl side chain of S158 helping to form a tight binding pocket for the nucleotide. In F28L, these two hydrogen bonds are weak or nonexistent as H-D exchange is seen for the backbone NH group of Q116 and D118. The structure of F28L in the region of residues 158-160 shows a small increase in the rmsd (%R ) 31), while the corresponding region in the wild type shows no change in rmsd relative to its core (%R  0). The chemical shift difference for these residues between the wild type and F28L is also significant, indicating that these residues lie in a different chemical environment in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP (17). In addition, several more NOEs are observed between

Adams and Oswald shows two NOE cross-peaks involving H of residue 117 and H of residue 159 that were not evident for the wild type, suggestive of a conformational change involving the nucleotide that brings the N1H group of the nucleotide ring into the proximity of both the A159 H and I117 H protons in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. These studies reveal several different contacts between the nucleotide and residues of the wild-type protein versus those in F28L due perhaps to a number of lost interactions in the nucleotide-binding site for Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. Summary. We have shown previously that this single-point mutation leads to increased flexibility on multiple time scales for most of the residues comprising the nucleotide-binding site as well as the nucleotide itself (17). We show here that although the structural changes are subtle, the interactions within the nucleotide-binding pocket, both within the protein and between the protein and nucleotide, likely contribute to the decrease in affinity for the nucleotide. NMR studies on H-Ras p21(F28L) indicated that the mutation distorted the binding site around the R- and -phosphate groups, but the area surrounding the -phosphate group was undisturbed (34). While this study does not address the -phosphate of the nucleotide because only the GDP form has been studied here, our results do show that the conformational differences in this mutant are not confined to the site of the mutation and that the entire nucleotide-binding site of Cdc42Hs(F28L)GDP is disturbed. Most oncogenic Ras proteins are locked in a perpetually active state (GTP-like state) and transduce signals that are directly involved in proliferation, transformation, or tumorigenesis (35). Mutations that alter the intrinsic ability of the protein to hydrolyze GTP to GDP and affect proper exchange may facilitate oncogenesis (1, 11, 36). Therefore, these proteins and the signal transduction pathways that help to regulate them are important targets for anticancer therapy. As mentioned previously, Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP mimics the fast nucleotide exchange and transformation capability caused by an interaction of wild-type Cdc42Hs with the Dbl oncoprotein (37). These studies describing the structural correlates of the F28L mutation in Cdc42Hs have provided important molecular information about the protein's function and will be extended to other mutations that affect normal functioning in signaling pathways.

the backbone NH group of these residues and other residues in the nucleotide-binding site for the wild-type protein than for F28L (Table 3). In the crystal structure of Cdc42Hs (PDB entry 1ANO), the backbone NH group of S158 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl of K163 while the backbone NH groups of A159 and L160 are hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of the guanine ring. All three of these hydrogen bonding interactions are weak or missing in F28L as determined from H-D exchange experiments. The Nucleotide. Compelling evidence of conformational differences at the nucleotide-binding site in Cdc42Hs(F28L)GDP relative to the wild type come from the 2D NMR spectrum with 15N-labeled GDP complexed to both proteins (Figure 4). The N1 proton of the guanine ring in the wildtype complex has a chemical shift of 12.81 ppm versus a shift of 12.92 ppm in the Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP complex. This finding is indicative of a more polar environment for the proton in the F28L complex due to either more solvent exposure or a stronger interaction with a more electron-rich group (32, 33). NMR analysis of [15N]GDP-bound Cdc42Hs and Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP shows that the nucleotide makes more contacts with residues of the nucleotide-binding site in the wild type than in Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP. The 1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectra of Cdc42Hs-[15N]GDP and Cdc42Hs(F28L)-GDP-[15N]GDP show NOE cross-peaks involving the nucleotide N1 proton and residues 116 and 157 in both proteins. However, several cross-peaks involving the nucleotide N1H group and residues 119 and 160 in the spectrum of wild-type [15N]GDP are not observed in the corresponding spectrum of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-[15N]GDP. Likewise, the 1H15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum of Cdc42Hs(F28L)-[15N]GDP
