The virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS) enables many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens to translocate proteins into the eukaryotic host cells that they infect. This unique protein transport process is mediated by the type III secretion apparatus (T3SA), a multisubunit membrane-spanning macromolecular assembly comprising O20 different proteins. Recent studies have identified biochemical and structural properties of the core T3SA, in addition to several components constituting this complex, with important implications for both the assembly process and the overall function of the T3SA. Introduction A common theme in modern pathogenesis research is that the pathogen and its host engage in complex molecular cross-talk that often dictates the outcome of an infection. Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens initiate this interkingdom communication by delivering their proteins directly to the cytoplasm of their eukaryotic hosts via the virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS) [1]. Present in species of Yersinia, Pseudomonas, Shigella, Salmonella and pathogenic Escherichia coli, the T3SS translocates proteins known as `effectors' on contact with eukaryotic host cells. The translocated effectors can then subvert eukaryotic cellular processes, enabling the pathogens to modulate directly their respective host environment for subsequent pathogenesis. Although the types of translocated effector tend to vary greatly among different species, the molecular machinery that mediates this protein transport process ­ namely, the type III secretion apparatus (T3SA) ­ is structurally and functionally conserved. More than 20 unique protein components, many of which show significant sequence identity across species, are required for proper function of the T3SA. Most of these proteins are involved in constructing a macromolecular complex that spans, remarkably, the inner bacterial membrane, the periplasmic space, the peptidoglycan layer, the outer bacterial membrane, the extracellular space and the host cellular membrane (Figure 1a). This large complex probably provides a continuous and direct path for effectors to move from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host. An important area of current research concerns the structure and function of the T3SA, because this

knowledge is necessary for understanding the still obscure molecular mechanism of type III protein translocation. In the past few years, considerable advances have been made on this front, including the first 3D reconstructions of the core T3SA and detailed biochemical and structural characterizations of several components of the T3SA. Here, we highlight these exciting new discoveries and discuss their contributions to our overall understanding of the T3SS. The T3SA and the needle complex Purification and identification of the core T3SA, often termed the `needle complex (NC)' because of its characteristic shape, constituted a landmark achievement in the field [2]. First isolated from Salmonella typhimurium, the NCs of several other species have since been purified and visualized by electron microscopy (EM) [3­5]. The NCs from these different sources show similar gross morphologies: a rigid and extended helical structure (the needle), which is anchored to a base that spans the inner and outer bacterial membranes and the periplasmic space. The base itself consists of two sets of concentric ring complexes embedded in each of the two membranes. Albeit smaller, the NC resembles the basal body of the bacterial flagellar apparatus in overall appearance (Figure 1a). This resemblance probably reflects a similarity in the organization of their structural proteins, some of which have been shown to share extensive sequence homology [6]. Attempts have been made to extend the resolution of these initial projected images. For example, Blocker et al. [3] used the single-particle approach to calculate 3D reconstructions from low-dose EM images of negatively stained Shigella flexneri NCs. The resulting EM map ° revealed a central channel of w20­30 A that extends from the bottom set of rings to the tip of the extracellular needle. This observation implies that, although the T3SA generates a molecular passageway for protein transport, this passageway is far too narrow for most globular proteins to go through and thus effectors need to be partially, if not completely, unfolded before translocation. Marlovits et al. [7] have taken this EM work further by using cryo-EM to image purified S. typhimurium NCs and by generating 3D reconstructions from these images. To overcome problems caused by sample heterogeneity, they sorted their imaged particles into different classes according to the rotational symmetry of their bases. The combination of this sorting and symmetry averaging

Figure 1. Overall morphology and organization of the virulence-associated type III secretion apparatus (T3SA). (a) The bacterial flagellar apparatus and T3SA. The overall morphologies of the two supramolecular complexes are highly similar: each consists of inner membrane (green and brown) and outer membrane (red) ring structures, a membrane-associated ATPase (pink), and helical extracellular structures (gray). The bacterial flagellum has two main functions: it acts as a secretion system to export structural components responsible for constructing the extracellular structures during the assembly process, and as a motor to propel bacterial motion after assembly of the whole complex. The T3SA also exports structural components (needle, needle extension and translocation pore subunits) to the extracellular compartment during assembly. On assembly, however, the T3SA translocates bacterial proteins directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic host cells (arrow), a process that requires the needle extension (blue) and a translocation pore (yellow) formed by two proteins on the target membrane. Also shown are selected protein components of the T3SA, referred to by their Yersinia family names with their counterparts in the flagellar system given in parentheses.

resulted in a much improved map with more noticeable surface features and, in particular, clear division of the individual subunits in the rings associated with the inner membrane (Figure 1b). Even though these EM studies have provided us with an excellent framework and a molecular envelope at intermediate resolution with which to understand the overall architecture of the T3SA, the current resolution of these maps is still too low to facilitate unambiguous localization of the individual components and assignment of secondary structural elements. Furthermore, because of the stringent chemical conditions used in sample preparation, the imaged complexes lack many essential components including the ATPase associated with the inner membrane. To take advantage of the increasingly powerful molecular EM equipment and algorithms, we need to develop new methods or to improve current procedures for preparing higher quality and more stable T3SA specimens. At the same time, additional effort should be put into, first, identifying and localizing the various structural components in the EM map by techniques such as antibody labeling; second, elucidating the underlying protein­protein interactions in the T3SA; and third, developing better biochemical or mass-spectrometrybased methods to expand and to verify the stoichiometric data obtained from previous studies [3,7,8].

Ongoing work on the pre-assembled complex will continue to illuminate the overall structure and molecular organization of the T3SA. Meanwhile, as we discuss in the following sections, great progress has been made on our understanding of the individual components that constitute this complex. Note that for historical reasons the T3SA genes from different species have been given different names. For clarity, here we use the Yersinia-based nomenclature for the T3SS wherever possible [9] (Table 1). Extracellular components The extracellular portion of the T3SA can be divided into three main parts: the needle, which is a helical polymer made from a few hundred copies of a single protein of the YscF family [10]; the needle extension, which consists of one sequence-divergent protein that forms either a bellshaped tip complex or a filamentous structure depending on the species; and the translocation pore, which comprises two proteins from the YopB and YopD family that presumably hetero-oligomerize into a channel in the host membrane and are required for effectors to enter into the host cell [11]. All of these structural components are exported to the extracellular space by the basal body of the T3SA, which functions as a protein secretion device during assembly. The needle is perhaps the most distinctive feature of the T3SA. Like the flagellar filament, it contains a hollow

° interior with a diameter of w25 A and is thought to function as a molecular conduit for type III protein translocation [3]. The helical structure of needles isolated from the Shigella T3SS (comprising the YscF family ° protein MxiH) has been determined at 16 A by negativestaining EM [10]. In addition to confirming the presence and dimensions of the central channel, this structure shows that the helical parameters of this needle (5.6 units ° ° per turn, 4.2-A axial rise per subunit, 24-A helical pitch) are strikingly similar to those previously estimated for the flagellar hook and filament. This finding is surprising considering that YscF family needle proteins, including Shigella MxiH, are markedly smaller than, and share almost no sequence identity with, the structural components that comprise flagellar extracellular structures. It has led to the hypothesis that the needle might alter its helical state in a manner similar to the conformational switching of the bacterial flagellar rod that occurs during adaptations to changes in the orientation of motor rotation, and such structural changes might be involved in sensing contact with the host and in regulating effector translocation [10,12]. Recently, Blocker and colleagues [13] isolated several MxiH mutants that lock the Shigella T3SA into different secretion states. Unfortunately, EM analyses of these mutant proteins have not revealed differences in the helical arrangements of the needles, indicating that the signal transduction might occur via a mechanism that has not yet been characterized [14]. In EM analyses of various T3SSs, the length of the extracellular needles seems to fall within a narrow range ° of w60 A, raising two questions. First, how can the bacterium precisely control the length of the needle? Studies using gene knockouts have identified Salmonella InvJ, Shigella Spa32 and Yersinia YscP as key regulators of needle length [15­17]. Cornelis and colleagues [17] examined Yersinia YscP and discovered, through a series of deletion and insertion experiments, that the needle length is proportional to the number of residues in the middle region of YscP. They proposed that YscP acts like a `molecular ruler' in which two globular terminal domains attach to the base and the growing tip of the needle and span an unstructured and extended ruler domain. When
www.sciencedirect.com

the needle reaches its desired length, the ruler domain becomes fully stretched and signals, through the baseassociated domain, to stop further export of the needle subunit and to initiate substrate switching. Second, why does needle length need to be controlled? By artificially manipulating the length of the Yersinia needle, Mota et al. [18] showed that increasing the distance between the tip of the needle and the host cell, either by reducing the length of the needle or increasing the height of the Yersinia surface adhesin, impaired type III protein translocation. This result is also supported by data from a previous study showing that the glucosylation state of the lipopolysaccharide on the surface of Shigella affects not only the length and thickness of these bacterial outer membrane molecules but also the accessibility and function of the T3SA needle [19]. Collectively, these data show that needle length reflects an adaptation to fit the physical and chemical environment of the bacteria­host interface, and lend further support to the notion that the needle is directly involved in sensing host cells. The needles from several species have been observed to be associated with additional structures. These `extensions' attach to the tip of the needles and seem to be involved in connecting to and mediating formation of the translocation pore. Recent EM work by Mueller et al. [20] has demonstrated that LcrV, a protein secreted by the Yersinia T3SA, forms a bell-shaped complex at the tip of the needle, and this tip structure is required for formation of the translocation pore. The availability of the crystal structure of LcrV should facilitate estimation of the stoichiometry of this tip complex and could possibly delineate the nature of its interaction with the polymeric needle [21] (Figure 2). The EspA filament is another type of needle extension that is found in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and other attaching and effacing animal pathogens. An analogous structure has also been identified recently in SPI-2, the second T3SS of S. typhimurium [22]. The EPEC EspA filament is a helical polymer made from multiple copies of a single protein, EspA, which does not show sequence homology to the EPEC needle component EscF. EM analyses of EPEC NCs have shown that the EspA

filament is firmly attached to the needle, but they have not defined whether EspA polymerizes around or on top of EscF [5]. The length of the EPEC needle, with the EspA filament attached, seems to be shorter than is typically observed in other T3SAs [5]. By contrast, the lengths of the EspA filaments vary considerably and can extend O600 nm, which is ten times longer than the average T3SS needle. The EspA filament might be a necessary adaptation to enable the T3SA of these pathogens to penetrate the thick glycocalyx layer that covers the surfaces of the intestinal epithelium that EPEC and other attaching and effacing pathogens infect. ° The EM structure of the EspA filament at 26 A has ° in diameter, analogous revealed a central channel of 25 A to those observed in the EM structures of the NCs and the Shigella needle, suggesting that this needle extension also functions as a molecular conduit for translocation [23]. Furthermore, as with the Shigella needle, the helical parameters of the EspA filament (5.6 subunits per turn, ° 4.3-A axial rise per subunit) resemble those of the flagellar extracellular structures. Thus, despite the sequence divergence in the individual components, the extracellular structures of the T3SA and flagella are probably assembled in a similar fashion. Studying the interactions that govern the assembly of extracellular helical components such as the needle has

been challenging because these proteins are designed to self-associate efficiently into polymeric structures and it is, in most cases, difficult to purify stable monomeric forms without involving some level of denaturation or deletions. Some of these technical issues were overcome in the recent biochemical and crystallographic analysis of EspA in complex with CesA [24] (Figure 2). By coexpressing EspA with CesA (a cytoplasmic protein that binds EspA and acts as a specific chaperone [25]) and purifying the resulting EspA­CesA complex, it was possible to study a monomeric form of full-length EspA without denaturation. Although this work has not generated a complete atomic picture of the EspA filament, two important principles regarding the assembly process of extracellular helical components have emerged. First, to maintain them in a monomeric state and to prevent premature self-association, the helical components of the T3SA and the flagellar apparatus are tightly regulated by specialized cytoplasmic proteins. CesA prevents polymerization of EspA by forming a high-affinity heterodimeric complex with this protein. Similarly, FliC or flagellin, which is the structural subunit of the flagellar filament, is kept in its monomeric state by a specific cytoplasmic chaperone known as FliS [26,27]. Recent data on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T3SS have shown that the oligomeric state of the needle component

PscF is also controlled in the same manner [28]. More specifically, Quinaud et al. [28] found that two cytoplasmic proteins, PscE and PscG, form a ternary 1:1:1 complex with the needle component PscF, trapping it in a monomeric state. Second, coiled coils are involved in intersubunit packing of the individual subunits in the filament and needle. The crystal structure of the EspA­CesA complex shows that two a helices located near the termini of EspA interact with CesA via highly specific dimeric coiled coils. The coiled-coil segments of EspA are arranged in a similar way as those in FliC and might have analogous roles in filament formation. The recent cryo-EM structure of the ° flagellar filament at 4.5 A has shown that the terminal regions of FliC form an intramolecular coiled coil that enables hydrophobic intersubunit packing to occur [29]. Outer membrane ring complex The organization of the outer membrane ring is quite simple because this structure comprises only one main protein component: secretin. Secretins form a large protein family whose members are widely dispersed across many species of Gram-negative bacteria. Not only are secretins present in the T3SS, they also participate in various macromolecular transport processes including type II secretion, type IV pilus biogenesis and filamentous phage release [30]. Secretins share neither sequence nor structural homology with any of the outer membrane components of the flagellar system. The structure and channel formation of various secretins, including two from the T3SS, have been examined by EM [31­34]. These analyses indicate that individual monomers associate into stable ring-like oligomers of 12­14 subunits with a central channel of 5­10 nm in diameter. Given their size, these channels probably function as portals for folded proteins to move across the outer membrane. In the T3SS, however, secretins (also known as YscC family proteins) seem to have a different role: the EM map of the NC shows that secretin `wraps' around the needle structure that extends beyond the bacterial envelope [3]. Instead of directly mediating protein movement across the outer membrane, the multimeric T3SS secretin protein probably functions as an anchoring and stabilization device. Notably, the outer membrane channel formed by secretin is closed by a `septum'-like structure before assembly of the needle [7]. Indeed, overexpressing Yersinia enterocolitica YscC in E. coli does not lead to increased permeability of the outer membrane [35], confirming that the secretin channel is closed in the absence of the needle. The recently reported and refined cryo-EM structure of isolated PulD, the secretin from the type II secretion system of Klebsiella oxytoca, also shows that the central channel of this multimeric ring complex is plugged [36]. Biogenesis of the secretin ring begins with protein synthesis in the bacterial cytoplasm and export of the individual monomers to the periplasm by the secdependent pathway. Subsequent folding and insertion into the outer membrane are crucial next steps to ensure proper oligomerization and channel formation. A specialized class of proteins known as pilotins has been shown to

mediate this process. Pilotins are a sequence-divergent family of small lipoproteins that are localized to the outer membrane and bind to the C termini of their cognate secretins. The recent crystal structure of MxiM, the T3SS pilotin from Shigella, has shed light on how this protein might assist the Shigella T3SA secretin MxiD in its insertion process [37]. A principal feature of the conical-shaped MxiM protein is a `cracked-barrel' domain that generates ° ° a hydrophobic cavity, w8 A wide and 20 A deep, in the center of the protein (Figure 2). Co-crystallization and isothermal titration calorimetry have shown that this unique cavity, which is distantly related to lipocalins, can bind acyl chains of bacterial lipids. The lipidated N terminus of MxiM, which is located in close proximity to this lipid-binding pocket, might bind here for stability before interacting with the outer membrane and MxiD. Another possibility is that MxiM could extract lipids from the outer membrane by using this lipid binding cavity to enable proper insertion of MxiD. Interestingly, further isothermal titration calorimetry experiments have demonstrated that a C-terminal peptide of MxiD encompassing the pilotin-binding region obstructs lipid binding to MxiM. This observation might imply that, once it is properly inserted into the outer membrane, MxiD locks MxiM in a conformation such that it is restricted to stabilizing the oligomeric MxiD­secretin structure. Inner membrane ring complex Systematic genetic knockout studies in Salmonella have shown that assembly of the T3SA occurs in discrete stages [38]. In particular, formation of the ring complexes in the two bacterial membranes seems to be the initiation step. Of these, the inner membrane set of rings is thought to be the first oligomeric structure that is elaborated. Consisting of multiple copies of at least three proteins, this substructure encompasses the inner membrane and part of the periplasm and cytoplasm, and is genetically, structurally and functionally similar to its counterpart in the flagellar basal body. This ring complex is thought to provide an early platform for localizing various structural components in the assembly process and for housing the machinery embedded in the inner membrane that catalyzes protein translocation. Previous biochemical work on the Salmonella NC indicated that two proteins, PrgK and PrgH, can form ring complexes in the inner bacterial membrane [39]. PrgK belongs to the highly conserved YscJ family of periplasmic proteins. These proteins are thought to be anchored to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane by a lipid that is covalently linked to their N termini after cleavage of the signal peptide [3,8], and sometimes also by a transmembrane segment at the C termini. The structure of a representative member of the YscJ family, EPEC EscJ, has been determined by separate groups using NMR and X-ray crystallography [8,40] (Figure 2). EscJ consists of two topologically similar mixed-a/b domains that are joined by an extended linker of w25 residues. Intriguingly, individual molecules pack into superhelices or spirals in the crystal structure, indicating that EscJ has the potential to form higher

ordered oligomers and most probably circular ring structures. On the basis of the crystal structure and packing, a ring model of EscJ has been constructed by collapsing the superhelical structure to a plane perpendicular to the helical axis while preserving most of the ° intermolecular contacts. The overall dimensions (180 A in ° diameter and 52 A in height) of this 24-subunit model are similar to those estimated from a previous EM analysis of the purified EPEC NC [5]. Thus, the model seems to be a close representation of a substantial portion of the inner membrane complex. As mentioned, YscJ proteins are anchored to the inner membrane by an N-terminal lipid and occasionally by a C-terminal transmembrane segment. Rather than generating a pore in the inner membrane, the multimeric ring elaborated by these proteins might create a specialized patch of membranes for recruiting putative inner membrane-embedded components such as YscR, YscS, YscT, YscU and YscV. The overall dome-shaped appearance of the ring model is reminiscent of the recent cryoEM structure of FliF, a key flagellar structural protein that shares sequence homology with the YscJ proteins at its N-terminal region [41]. The EscJ ring might have a function analogous to that of the membrane and supramembrane ring (MS ring) elaborated by FliF, which is thought to act as a molecular platform for assembly. Several unique surface features, including a charged `trench' at the periplasmic opening, in addition to distinct cavities and negatively charged patches in the interior, support this hypothesis. The modeled ring, however, lacks the protruding rod that is present in the MS ring. A different protein (Salmonella PrgJ and its sequencedivergent orthologs in other species) has been suggested to be responsible for forming this so-called `inner rod' structure [7]. Another prominent part of the inner membrane subassembly of the flagellar basal body is the cytoplasmic ring or `C-ring', which comprises the two components FliN and FliM [42]. The `cytoplasmic bulb' observed by EM in osmotically shocked Shigella has been proposed to be the analogous C-ring in the T3SA [43], but this structure has not been clearly defined in EM studies of purified NCs [3,7]. The highly conserved YscQ family of T3SS proteins shares significant sequence homology at its C-terminal region with flagellar FliN and FliM. Using EM, Sasakawa and colleagues [44] have recently shown that the Shigella YscQ homolog Spa33 localizes to a lower portion of the NC via interaction with the core inner membrane ring components MxiJ and MxiG (the orthologs of Salmonella PrgK and PrgH, respectively), thereby providing the first experimental evidence of a multimeric YscQ structure. They also demonstrated that Spa33 interacts with several T3SS proteins including Spa47, a member of the highly conserved inner membrane-associated YscN family of T3SS ATPases, suggesting that this putative C-ring might function as an additional recruitment platform at the interface between the cytoplasm and inner membrane. Exactly how the YscQ proteins assemble into larger oligomers can probably be learned from the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of Pseudomonas syringae HrcQB, a member of the YscQ family [45]

(Figure 2). This structure shows that two HrcQB monomers fold together in a symmetric manner to form a compact and intertwined dimer consisting of two sixstranded antiparallel b-sheets bridged through a long b-ribbon. The dimer, in turn, interacts with another dimer via hydrogen bonds between backbone atoms to form an elongated, gently curved homotetramer. In agreement with the high degree of sequence identity, the overall fold of HrcQB is remarkably similar to that of FliN, whose crystal structure has been subsequently determined [46]. On the basis of their structure, Fadouloglou et al. [45] proposed that the HrcQB homotetramer might be the repeating unit that forms the large multimeric C-ring-like complex in the T3SA. Regulatory and catalytic components The components we have discussed are structural proteins responsible for generating the molecular channel that the effectors use to cross the various barriers during translocation. The T3SA also consists of several catalytic and regulatory proteins that are located in the cytoplasm or on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. The most well-characterized regulatory proteins are the type III secretion chaperones (T3SCs) ­ small acidic proteins that bind to specific effectors in the cytoplasm and mediate their translocation. Owing to space constraints, we refrain from discussing these proteins here and instead refer readers to excellent recent reviews [1,47,48]. In addition to the T3SCs, it has been proposed that in Yersinia a heterotetrameric complex, comprising YopN, TyeA and the heterodimeric T3SCs SycN and YscB, regulates translocation by blocking the secretion channel from the inside in the absence of the host [49]. A model of this key switch complex, based on the crystal structures of YopN­TyeA and YopN­SycN­YscB, has been recently constructed [50] (Figure 2). In this elongated structure, the N-terminal secretion signal of YopN and the C-terminal TyeA-binding domain lie at opposite ends. On the basis of this model, Schubot et al. [50] have suggested that a patch of highly conserved residues on the surface of the C-terminal a helix of TyeA might mediate interaction with structural components of the T3SA and thereby enable the heterotetrameric complex to function as a macromolecular plug of the secretion channel. A distinctive catalytic component of the T3SA is the YscN family of proteins, which are highly conserved and show extensive sequence similarity to the b subunit of F0F1 ATPases. Recent biochemical work on a member of this family, HrcN from P. syringae, has shown that this protein hydrolyzes ATP and forms hexamers and dodecamers that are peripherally associated with the cytoplasmic side of the inner bacterial membrane [51]. Although it is known that this ATP hydrolysis reaction is required for protein translocation, it has not been clear how the energy transduced from the reaction is used. Akeda and Galan [52] have recently shown that the S. typhimurium YscN ATPase, a protein known as InvC, releases the cytoplasmic T3SC from the T3SC­effector complex in an ATP-dependant manner [52]. These data suggest that the ATPase interacts with the T3SC and facilitates protein secretion or translocation, probably by

loading the unfolded domain of the effector into the apparatus, similar to the mechanism observed for the bacterial AAAC ATPase disassembly machinery [53]. Whether the ATPase has additional functions, such as providing energy for protein movement along the considerable length of the T3SA, however, remains to be verified. Conclusion and future challenges In the past few years, structural biology and biochemistry have transformed our view of the T3SA. In terms of structures, we now have intermediate-resolution EM maps of the core T3SA and extracellular structures including the needle and the filament, and high-resolution crystal structures of at least five components. These structural data have shed new light on the assembly process and, in particular, begin to explain how, at the molecular level, these small structural components assemble or mediate other T3SA proteins to construct parts of the T3SA. Structural work on the core T3SA and the needle has also shown us that effectors are likely to be translocated in a partially or completely unfolded manner. Regrettably, however, the newer and higher resolution data on the individual components have not further advanced our understanding of the molecular mechanism of type III protein translocation. Ongoing structural studies will undoubtedly continue to build a higher resolution and more complete picture of the T3SA, but we also urgently need to address important functional questions arising from these structures. What are the specific roles of the different components in the activation and regulation of type III secretion? What is the chemical and physical nature of the molecular conduit and what special characteristics enable proteins to move along it? And how does the T3SA switch from the assembly mode to the effector translocation mode? We also need to begin dissecting how the structural components interact with one another in the context of the bacterial membranes, because many of the components embedded in the inner membrane have important roles in mediating and regulating type III secretion but are evidently lost during purification of the NC. Finally, developing methods to reconstitute the secretion and translocation subunits of the T3SA in vitro should enable us to understand how the different events that have been observed or postulated from the structural studies are coordinated.

AGORA initiative provides free agriculture journals to developing countries
The Health Internetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) of the WHO has launched a new community scheme with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. As part of this enterprise, Elsevier has given 185 journals to Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture (AGORA). More than 100 institutions are now registered for the scheme, which aims to provide developing countries with free access to vital research that will ultimately help increase crop yields and encourage agricultural self-sufficiency. According to the Africa University in Zimbabwe, AGORA has been welcomed by both students and staff. `It has brought a wealth of information to our fingertips' says Vimbai Hungwe. `The information made available goes a long way in helping the learning, teaching and research activities within the University. Given the economic hardships we are going through, it couldn't have come at a better time.' For more information visit: http://www.healthinternetwork.net
