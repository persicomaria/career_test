Abstract The tumor suppressor protein p53 is ubiquitinated and neddylated by MDM2 and then degraded by 26S proteasome. However, p53 is stabilized by the HAUSP (Herpes-virus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease) deubiquitinating enzyme. In this study, we discovered that rat HAUSP (rHAUSP) is polyubiquitinated, polyneddylated, and dimerized using co-immunoprecipitation assays. This suggests that rHAUSP may function as a dimer or multimer and is also degraded through the proteasome-mediated degradation. Transfection of rHAUSP into RGC-Lac-Z cell line with the integrated p53 response element revealed that rHAUSP contributed to p53 stabilization, and a rHAUSP (C224S) mutant contributed to p53 destabilization in a dose-dependent manner. ” 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is mediated by either lysosome or proteasome pathway. Lysosome-mediated degradation pathway is involved in degradation of 10≠20% proteins and the rest of proteins are degraded by the proteasomemediated degradation pathway [1]. Ubiquitination and deubiquitination have a precise role for selective protein degradation in eukaryotic cells, and are important for the regulation of a number of intracellular processes including cell cycle, apoptosis, transcriptional activation, signal transduction, antigen presentation, oncogenesis, preimplantation, and DNA repair [2≠4]. In general, ubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation by the 26S proteasome. Deubiquitination, a removal process of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugated protein substrates, is mediated by deubiquitinating enzymes [5,6].

The downregulation of p53 tumor suppressor activity through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in normal cells is mediated by MDM2, which is the major E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 [7≠ 9]. MDM2 alone does not efficiently polyubiquitinate p53 in vitro [10], and p300 is required to catalyze p53 polyubiquitination [11]. p53 ubiquitination is regulated by deubiquitination mediated by Herpes-virus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (HAUSP) (also known as USP7), which directly deubiquitinates and stabilizes p53 [12]. HAUSP also plays a crucial role in the regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth [12]. It has been shown that a partial reduction of endogenous HAUSP levels destabilizes endogenous p53 [13]. However, nearly complete ablation of HAUSP stabilizes and activates p53 because HAUSP is also required for the stability of endogenous MDM2, which is constitutively self-ubiquitinated and degraded in vivo [13,14]. In the absence of HAUSP, MDM2 appears to be extremely unstable, leading to indirect p53 activation. This feedback-mediated p53 stabilization is MDM2 dependent [13]. We recently isolated and characterized a mouse orthologue of HAUSP, mHAUSP [15]. Here, we also identified a rat orthologue of HAUSP, rHAUSP. As a deubiquitinating enzyme, rHAUSP regulates p53 stabilization in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, rHAUSP is ubiquitinated, neddylated, and dimerized.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Isolation, site-directed mutagenesis, and Northern blot analysis for rHAUSP Total RNA was obtained from the rat testis using TRIzol (Gibco BRL). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA according to the protocol of SuperScript Preamplification System (Gibco BRL). The primer nucleotide sequences for cloning rHAUSP are following: F (BamHI), 5 0 -CCGGATCCGACATGAACC-A-3 0 ; R (XhoI), 5 0 -GACACTCGAGGGAAGTCAGTT-3 0 . Site-directed mutagenesis for generating rHAUSP (C224S) was carried out with a QuikChangee Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), primers were designed as following; 5 0 primer (5 0 -GGGAGCAACGAGTTACATCAATAGCTTGC-3 0 ) and 3 0 primer (5 0 -GCAAGCTATTCATGTAACTCGTTGCTCCC-3 0 ). Expression of the rHAUSP mRNA was investigated in rat tissues by Northern blot analysis. Tissue blot for Northern blot analysis was purchased from SeeGene. The blot was hybridized with a radiolabeled DNA probe corresponding to nucleotide (1≠875 bp) of the rHAUSP. As described previously [15], the probe used for Northern blot analysis was labeled by a random primer with [a-32P] dCTP (Amersham Biosciences).

4868 2.2. p53 response element assay RGC-Lac-Z cells were cultured and transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Whether rHAUSP contributes to p53 stabilization in a dose-dependent manner, we performed transfection of rHAUSP into RGCLac-Z cell line with the integrated p53 response element upstream of b-galactosidase. 1.5 ∑ 105 cells in 35 mm wells were transfected with pcDNA3-myc, or 0.25, 0.5, and 1-lg of pcDNA3-myc-rHAUSP or pcDNA3-myc rHAUSP (C224S). After 24 h of transfection, cells were harvested and lysed. 40-lg of total proteins was loaded in each lane of a 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate≠polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS≠PAGE) for immunoblot analysis using an anti-bgalactosidase (ICN). Equal loading was verified by immunoblotting against an anti-b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The relative expression level of b-galactosidase induced by p53 in transfected RGC-Lac-Z cells was determined according to the expression level of the b-actin housekeeping gene. The band density was measured using a Gel-Doc image analyzer (Bio-Rad) and average intensities of the bands were normalized to those of b-actin used as a control. Expression levels were tested at least three times by independent transfection.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Expression of rat HAUSP, the orthologue of mouse and human HAUSPs In order to identify the complete cDNA for rHAUSP, a rat orthologue of mouse and human HAUSPs, we first performed BLAST search for the sequence of rat HAUSP. However, database from GenBank showed the first exon sequence of rHAUSP cDNA unlisted. Therefore, we carried out RT-PCR with primers used for cloning the full-length mHAUSP cDNA using the rat testis. We found out that it consists of 3312 bp and encodes 1103 amino acids with a molecular weight of approximately 135 kDa. rHAUSP contains the highly conserved Cys, Asp (I), His, and Asn/Asp (II) domains characteristic of the ubiquitin-specific processing proteases. rHAUSP has 98.6% amino acid identity with hHAUSP and 99.6% amino acid identity with mHAUSP (Supplemental material). One of interesting features in HAUSP family members is polyQ domain, showing 7 Glu residues in hHAUSP, and 8 Glu residues in both mHAUSP and rHAUSP (Supplemental material). Aberrant expansion of unstable CAG trinucleotide repeats results in numerous neurodegenerative diseases including spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17, Huntington’s disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and Machado-Joseph disease [16]. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether elongated polyglutamine in HAUSP results in neurodegenerative diseases. In order to determine the expression pattern and transcriptional size of rHAUSP, we performed Northern blot analysis using a rat adult tissue blot. The probe was generated from the full-length cDNA of rHAUSP by digesting with BamHI and HindIII. 4.5 and 4.9 kb of transcripts were shown (Fig. 1). We found that rHAUSP has two transcripts in a rat tissue blot, possibly due to either the alternative splicing or alternate polyadenlyation sites. The expression was shown strongly in rat testis, spleen and brain, and weakly in rat stomach, small intestine, skeletal muscle and unpregnant uterus. These results were similar to the expression pattern of

2.3. In vivo co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assay and Western blotting (WB) analysis After transfection with each cDNA construct, HeLa cells in the absence or presence of 50-lM MG132 (Sigma) were harvested and lysed. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody or an anti-HAUSP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for in vivo ubiquitination assay of rHAUSP, with an anti-HAUSP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for in vivo neddylation assay of rHAUSP, with an 6 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) or an anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for in vivo dimerization assay of rHAUSP and hHAUSP at 4 ∞C for 6 h and then combined with 50-ll protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by rotating for 1 h at 4 ∞C. The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer three times, and separated on a 10% SDS≠polyacrylamide gel. WB was performed with an anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), an anti-HAUSP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or an anti-nedd8 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences).

mHAUSP [15]. mHAUSP and rHAUSP were expressed the most strongly in testis (Fig. 1 and [15]). 3.2. HAUSP regulates p53 stability and induces apoptosis HAUSP has at least dual functions, stabilization of p53, MDM2, and HDMX by deubiquitination, inducing p53dependent apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth [12,13,17]. We confirmed these functions by two experiments. First, to elucidate the function of rHAUSP in regulation of p53 ubiquitination, we co-transfected p53, ubiquitin and rHAUSP in HeLa cells as described previously [15]. HeLa cells were transfected with pCS4(+)-myc-p53 alone, with pCS4(+)-myc-p53

and pMT123-HA-ubiquitin together, or with pCS4(+)-mycp53, pMT123-HA-ubiquitin and pcDNA3-myc-rHAUSP together. p53 proteins became endogenously ubiquitinated, and deubiquitinated by co-transfection with rHAUSP. However, the amount of ubiquitinated p53 in cells expressing rHAUSP (C224S) was similar to the one in control cells without rHAUSP transfection (data not shown). These results indicate that rHAUSP has the same function for deubiquitinating p53 as shown with either HAUSP [12] or mHAUSP [15]. Second, to confirm whether rHAUSP and rHAUSP (C224S) are involved in stabilization of p53 level, we carried out transfection of rHAUSP and rHAUSP (C224S) into RGC-Lac-Z

Fig. 2. p53 response element assay. (A) RGC-Lac-Z cell line with the integrated p53 response element upstream of b-galactosidase was transfected with pcDNA3 (lane 1), or 0.25 lg (lanes 2 and 5), 0.5 lg (lanes 3 and 6), and 1 lg (lanes 4 and 7) of pcDNA3-myc-rHAUSP or pcDNA3-mycrHAUSP (C224S), respectively. Western analysis was performed with an anti-b-galactosidase antibody, an anti-myc, or an anti-p53 antibody (DO-1). Equal loading was verified by immunoblotting against an anti-b-actin. (B) Shown are the results from the semi-quantitative expression analysis of bgalactosidase induced by p53. The ratios were determined by dividing the band density of b-galactosidase expression (closed bars) and p53 expression (gray bars) by that of b-actin (open bars). (C) Non-transfected HeLa cells show a low expression level of caspase 3 (lane 1). Caspase 3 was highly expressed in HeLa cells transfected with rHAUSP (C224S) (lane 3) compared with rHAUSP (lane 2). The expression level of caspase 3 is represented by quantification in a graph.

cell line with the integrated p53 response element (Fig. 2). RGC-Lac-Z cell line is a mouse cell line with the integrated p53 response element upstream of b-galactosidase and used to detect the activation of endogenous p53. The assay showed that rHAUSP regulates p53 level (Fig. 2A and B). In this assay, endogenous p53 was used as a control (Fig. 2A, lane 1). As the transfection amount of rHAUSP was increased (Fig. 2A, lanes 2≠4), the b-galactosidase expression level induced by p53 was gradually increased compared with the b-galactosidase expression level induced by endogenous p53 (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In addition, the p53 expression level was increased (Fig. 2A, lanes 2≠4). This result indicates that rHAUSP is associated with p53 stabil-

ization in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, as the transfection amount of rHAUSP (C224S) was increased (Fig. 2A, lanes 5≠7), the b-galactosidase expression level induced by p53 and p53 expression level were gradually decreased. As shown in Fig. 2B, the relative expression of b-galactosidase in RGC-Lac-Z cell line transfected with rHAUSP or rHAUSP (C224S) was gradually increased or decreased, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. We examined rHAUSP-induced apoptosis in human cervical adenocarcinoma cells (HeLa) by observing their morphological changes and by measuring the pattern of DNA fragmentation, which represents chromosomal cleavage at the linker

(A) HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-HA-ubiquitin and treated with MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), and then immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-HAUSP antibody. WB was performed with an anti-HA, an antiubiquitin or an anti-HAUSP antibody. (B) HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3-myc-nedd8 and treated with MG132 and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-HAUSP antibody.

regions between nucleosomes. As expected, rHAUSP-transfected HeLa cells died completely. We observed extracted genomic DNA from apoptotic HeLa cells induced by rHAUSP and rHAUSP (C224S), visualized as DNA ladders, indicating that these cells are apoptotic (data not shown). We also investigated the expression level of caspase 3 as an apoptotic marker using an anti-caspase 3 antibody (Fig. 2C). Caspase 3 was more strongly expressed in HeLa cells transfected with rHAUSP (C224S) than with rHAUSP (Fig. 2C). Transfection of pcDNA3-myc-rHAUSP (C224S) leads to cell death of HeLa cells which they died faster than HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3-myc-rHAUSP. It has been reported that HAUSP affected p53-mediated cell growth repression in H460 and MEF cells expressing p53, and HAUSP (C224S) functions as a dominant-negative by enhancing, instead of inhibiting, p53 ubiquitination [12]. Therefore, our study supports a previous finding that the dominant negative effect of rHAUSP (C224S) leads to cell death of HeLa cells. One of possibilities is that the mutated HAUSP may bind other proteins regulating apoptosis. Therefore, identification and characterization of more substrates for HAUSP and the mutant form of HAUSP (C224S) should be carried out in order to better understand the cellular functions of HAUSP. 3.3. HAUSP is polyubiquitinated and polyneddylated We recently reported that deubiquitinating enzymes, DUB1A and USP36, are polyubiquitinated [18,19]. In addition, it has been reported that p53 is ubiquitinated [20], sumoylated [21,22], and neddylated [23]. Therefore, we investigated whether HAUSP would also be regulated by conjugation with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules. In order to investigate whether HAUSP is regulated by the proteasome-mediated pathway, we co-transfected ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like molecules along with rHAUSP in HeLa cells. Interestingly, rHAUSP is polyubiquitinated at HA-tagged ubiquitin overexpression and endogenous status (Fig. 3A). In addition,

rHAUSP is polyneddylated at myc-tagged nedd8 overexpression and endogenous status (Fig. 3B), but not sumoylated (data not shown). When rHAUSP was exogenously expressed, we observed the same results (data not shown). Also, we investigated that the effect of proteasome inhibitor MG132 to confirm that rHAUSP is regulated by ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. According to this result, the level of ubiquitinated rHAUSP was increased with the addition of MG132 (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). Our results also suggest that rHAUSP is participated in the protein degradation pathway mediated by the ubiquitin-like molecule, nedd8, due to the increase of neddylated rHAUSP with the addition of MG132 (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). Therefore, identification of both E3 ligase and deubiquitinating/deneddylating enzymes for HAUSP will help to elucidate the precise regulatory mechanism of HAUSP-mediated p53 regulation. 3.4. HAUSP is dimerized A number of proteins undergo homodimerization or heterodimerization for their functional structures. We previously observed the dimerization of the murine DUB-1 enzyme expressed only in B-lymphocytes (unpublished observation). In order to investigate whether rHAUSP is also dimerized, we expressed FLAG-tagged rHAUSP and myc-tagged hHAUSP in HeLa cells. Since endogenous hHAUSP is expressed in HeLa cells, interaction between endogenous hHAUSP and FLAG-tagged rHAUSP or myc-tagged hHAUSP was analyzed (Fig. 4A and B, respectively). When immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG or anti-myc antibody, two bands, endogenous hHAUSP and FLAG-tagged rHAUSP or myc-tagged hHAUSP, were detected (Fig. 4A and B, lanes 4, respectively), indicating that HAUSP is dimerized. However, whether HAUSP dimerization is required for its enzymatic function remains to be investigated. It is clear that the enzymatic activity of HAUSP is critical for regulating the status of p53. Since MDM2, p300/CBP,

Fig. 4. HAUSP is dimerized. (A) HeLa cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-2B-rHAUSP and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody. WB was performed with an anti-HAUSP antibody or an anti-FLAG antibody. (B) pcDNA3-myc-hHAUSP was also transfected into HeLa cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody and WB was performed with an anti-HAUSP antibody or an anti-myc antibody.
