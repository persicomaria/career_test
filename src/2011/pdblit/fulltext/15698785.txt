40 -Epiadriamycin is a better-tolerated anthracycline drug, due to lesser cardiotoxicity. We report here a study of the 2:1 complex of 40 -epiadriamycin-d-(CGATCG)2 by proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy which show the absence of sequential connectivities between C1pG2 and C5pG6 base pair steps and presence of intermolecular cross peaks of the drug and DNA. Our studies establish the role of 9OH, NH3 ˛ , 7O, 4OCH3 groups in binding to DNA. Time-resolved fluorescence measurement and diffusion ordered spectroscopic studies reveal the formation of complex. The nonspecific interactions as well as those essential for biological activity are discussed along with its medicinal importance. ” 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction The anthracycline family of antibiotics is effective in treating a variety of cancers.1,2 The therapeutic properties of the various members of the family are attenuated by the chemical substituents on the fused ring system and on the amino sugar.1,3 Analogs have been synthesized in order to circumvent the adverse toxic effects of these drugs.4 The 40 -epiadriamycin (Fig. 1a) developed recently is better tolerated due to lesser cardiotoxicity. 40 -Epiadriamycin has been an outcome of the constant search to look for new ligands or modify the existing drugs in order to overcome the adverse effects of cell toxicity or tumor-resistance. It differs from adriamycin only by an inversion of the stereochemistry at the 40 -position of the sugar. The understanding of drug≠DNA interaction is the first step to realize potent activity and low toxicity of these drugs. A wealth of studies has been performed to understand the structural, kinetics, and energetics of interaction5≠9 between the anthracycline drug and DNA. Theoretical studies10 have suggested that it preferentially recognizes a triplet sequence, with the sequences 50 GCT and 50 CGA being the most energetically favored. DNase I foot printing titration procedure identified the most strongly preferred daunomycin binding site to be the triplet sequences 50 CGA, 50 CGT, 50 CGA and 50 GCT, indicating that either A

or T may occupy the position neighboring the intercalation site.11 The X-ray crystal structure analysis of adriamycin with dCGATCG12 has revealed hydrogen bonding of 9OH moiety of drug with G2N1H and G2N3. Further NH3 ˛ moiety of daunosamine sugar forms hydrogen bonds with O2 of C5, O40 of C5, and O2 of T4 residues. The X-ray crystallographic studies on d-TGTACA and dTGATCA with daunomycin13 and 40 -epiadriamycin14,15 have shown sequence dependence of the binding of amino sugar to the A≠T base pair outside the intercalation site. In addition several other van der Waal's contacts also help in stabilizing the complex. Solution structure of adriamycin with dCGATCG by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy16 and molecular modeling studies17 of daunomycin with d(CGCGCGATCGCGCG)2 have shown that there exists a conformational equilibrium between different populations of conformers. A trans form for backbone torsional angle C30 ≠O30 ≠P≠O50 , f, is observed at G2pT3 and C5pG6 units. Further O-glycosidic bond angle C70 ≠O7≠C10 ≠C20 -centered around 59∞ having an energy barrier of 1.4 kcal mol¿1 from the usual 137∞ conformer may be present17 which will change the disposition of NH3 ˛ moiety in minor groove of DNA. The interaction involving intercalation of planar chromophore (ring BCD) of the drug at the 50 pyrimidine≠purine 30 sequence, that is, d-CpG or d-TpG step is found to be preserved due to direct involvement of guanine present at the second position in DNA sequences in binding. The complex is stabilized by two hydrogen

plex d-(CGATCG)2 since this contains two symmetrically equivalent CGA and TCG 40 -epiadriamycin binding sites and thus 2:1 40 epiadriamycin≠duplex complex retains the twofold symmetry of the free DNA. Sequence specific assignment of small DNA duplex is well established and that for drug molecule has been taken from our paper.18 We present here our results on interaction of 40 -epiadriamycin with d-(CGATCG)2 (Fig. 1b). We have reported the 1H NMR results of titrations of drug with DNA followed by change in chemical shift, analysis of NOE data, the drug≠DNA contacts and the structural features of drug and DNA hexamer in the complex. The inter-proton distance restraints have been used to carry out molecular dynamics simulations. The final convergent structure has been analyzed with respect to helicoidal parameters and backbone torsional angles. The conformation of ring A and daunosamine sugar has been obtained. Specific intermolecular contacts have been extracted and correlation between different structural parameters has been investigated. We have obtained conformational parameters, correlations between them and intermolecular contacts to establish the mode of binding. Time-resolved fluorescence measurement and diffusion ordered spectroscopic studies19 have been done to show that there is complex formation. A complete comprehensive view of the drug≠DNA interaction with a purpose of understanding molecular basis of action is presented in this manuscript.

2. Results and discussion 2.1. NMR studies on complex of 40 -epiadriamycin-d-(CGATCG)2 The proton NMR spectra of the complex of 40 -epiadriamycin-d(CGATCG)2 at various drug (D)/DNA (N) ratios, D/N = 0.16, 0.32, 0.48, 0.64, 0.80, 0.96, 1.11, 1.27, 1.43, 1.53, 1.60, 1.75, 1.91 and 2.03 at 275 K are recorded, few are shown in Figure 2a≠c. At 275 K, the imino proton signals are sharpened and intensified. Besides, DNA is expected to be present completely in duplex state at 275 K. The assignment of nucleotide protons (Table 1a) are done using the standard strategies, that is, sequential NOEs (base H8/ H6)n-sugar (H10 )n¿1, (base H8/H6)n-sugar(H200 )n¿1, (base H8/H6)nsugar(H20 )n¿1 and drug protons (Table 1b) are assigned using Barthwal et al.18 as the reference. On addition of 40 -epiadriamycin to d-(CGATCG)2, new drug proton signals are seen which increase in intensity with D/N ratios. This is evident from the resonance signals of 10 H, 7H, 50 CH3, 6OH, 11OH, 1H, 2H and 3H protons shown in Figure 2a≠c. The initially sharp NMR spectral lines of free DNA duplex broaden significantly without the appearance of a new set of NMR resonances for the bound complex. Both the nucleotide and drug protons, each having one set of resonances, shift gradually from their position in uncomplexed state with D/N ratio (Supplementary data 1 and 2). The spectra of the complex of 40 -epiadriamycin-d-(CGATCG)2 as a function of temperature are obtained at D/N = 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 (Fig. 3a and b) at the range 275≠328 K (Supplementary data 3a≠c and 4). 2.1.1. Characteristic of drug≠DNA complex In uncomplexed or free d-(CGATCG)2, T4NH and G2NH peaks appear at 13.74 and 12.95 ppm, respectively, while the G6NH resonance is not seen presumably due to exchange with water solvent. On successive addition of 40 -epiadriamycin to DNA, four additional resonance peaks are observed at 11.89, 13.75, 12.16, 12.01 ppm besides the 6OH and 11OH peak at about 13.81 and 12.41 ppm. In 2D NOESY spectra (Fig. 4a) pairs of protons resonating at 12.84, 11.89; 13.69, 13.75 and 12.16, 12.01 give cross peaks (shown in circle) with each other. Since T4NH and G2NH appear at 13.74 and 12.95 ppm in uncomplexed/d-(CGATCG)2, the peaks at 13.75 and 11.89 ppm get assigned to T4NH and G2NH in the com-

bonds, N2H and N3 of guanine with 9O and 9OH of the drug, respectively, in all complexes. The amino sugar lies in the minor groove forming up to five hydrogen bonds with the adjacent intercalating second base, adjacent third base pair and water molecules. The amino group is located closer to the second base pair in 50 ≠30 sequence and its sugar edge. This tends to make shorter van der Waal's and hydrogen bond contacts with d-CGATCG than that with d-CGTACG. This demonstrated the role of third base pair, suggested also by theoretical energy calculations.10 The conformation of the ring A of the drug in complexes with d-TGATCA is H8 with C8 atom deviating 0.71 ≈ away from sugar. On the other hand, in d-TGTACA, d-CGTACG complexes, ring A conformation is 9H with C9 atom deviating by 0.53 ≈ and 0.59 ≈, respectively, towards daunosamine sugar. The hydroxyl group at C14 position in 40 -epiadriamycin/ adriamycin is involved in additional contact through water molecule to the DNA phosphate resulting in further stabilization of the complex. The torsional angle in glycosyl linkage of the daunomycin molecule is significantly reduced from 162≠167∞ to 1272013144∞ while the daunomycin sugar is in unsymmetrical boat or chair conformation in the various structures of the complexes. Thus both DNA and drug exhibit considerable conformational flexibility in these complexes. The present study has been done on 40 -epiadriamycin-d(CGATCG)2 complex using NMR with the aim that NMR has the advantage of providing information about the system in solution and also yields insights into dynamic processes. The existence of bound and free resonances of imino protons of DNA clearly demonstrates that the drug indeed binds to the DNA hexamer and there is a slow exchange of free and bound DNA on NMR time scale at low temperature. Here, we have chosen the self-complementary du-

(G6NHb 12.01 ppm). The area under the NH peaks, confirmed that the G2NH/T4NH/G6NH indeed split into two sets of peaks. The ratio of area of T4NHf to T4NHb decreased from 3:1 (approximately)

at D/N ratio of 1.0 to 2:1 at D/N ratio of 2.0, that is, on addition of an increasing amount of drug to DNA. It is noted that the intensity of G6NHf peaks is significantly lesser than that of G2NHf and T4NHf. Also the NOE cross peak of G6NHf and G2NHf resonance corresponding to a distance of 3.72 ≈ in standard B-DNA structures is weaker in intensity than the NOE cross peak of T4NHf and G2NHf which also corresponds to a distance of 3.72 ≈. This suggests that G6NH proton which completely exchanges with water in free d(CGATCG)2, is immobilized in the drug≠DNA complex although it is still fraying to some extent being the terminal base pair of DNA. Accordingly the line width of G6NHb is found to be greater than that of G2NHb and T4NHb. It is observed that the sharp T4CH3 peak appearing at 1.37 ppm in d-(CGATCG)2 decreases in intensity as D/N ratio increases and one new, relatively broad peak appearing at 1.20 ppm, respectively, start growing in intensity with D/N (Fig. 2a); the same is also manifestes in the area plot. These peaks exchange with each other and hence the peak at 1.20 ppm gets assigned to T4CH3 of DNA bound to the drug molecule (T4CH3b). The existence of two sets of T4NH, G6NH, G2NH, and T4CH3 clearly demonstrates that the drug indeed binds to the DNA hexamer and there is a slow exchange of free and bound DNA on NMR time scale at 275 K. 2.1.2. Change in chemical shift due to complexation There are two intercalative sites available for the drug. The change in chemical shift (Dd) of base and H10 protons with ratios are gradual and small in magnitude. The Dd increases with D/N ratio as more of hexamer binds to the drug and a maximum of 0.20 ppm upfield shift is observed for C1H10 and G2H10 protons. T4NH bound imino proton is downfield shifted with respect to the corresponding imino protons in free state; the shift being 0.06 ppm, whereas G2NH and G6NH bound imino protons are upfield shifted and the shifts are 0.95 and 0.15 ppm, respectively (Table 1a, Fig. 4a, cross peaks are encircled). Such changes may be attributed to stacking or structural changes in complexation. 1H resonance signals are observed on addition of increasing amount of drug in the temperature range 275≠328 K at steps of 5 K (Supplementary data 3a≠c, Fig. 3a and b). Till 308 K temperature, the

signals are in slow exchange regime and are sufficiently broad to be followed individually through the titration. It is observed that there is variation of chemical shift with temperature showing downfield shift of 0.25 ppm for C1H10 and 0.28 ppm for C5H10 at D/N 2.0. There is noticeable change in the drug and nucleic acid protons in the range 275≠328 K. This indicates that structurally only one complex is being formed and the chemical shift at any one temperature is not an average of bound and unbound DNA/ drug, the equilibrium of which is likely to shift with temperature. The area plots of T4NH, G2NH, G6NH and T4CH3 in bound and free state also confirm that only one bound species exists in this temperature range. The gradual change with temperature in the range 275≠328 K may be due to destacking/decreased intercalation and duplex to single strand transition. 2.1.3. Chemical shift of 40 -epiadriamycin in the drug≠DNA complex There is a gradual shift in drug protons on binding to DNA. The ring protons, 1H, 2H and 3H, shift upfield substantially up to 0.6 ppm with respect to the chemical shift position of drug monomer, dmonomer in 2:1 drug to DNA complex at 275 K (Supplementary data 2). The downfield shift Dd = db ¿ df is 0.40 ppm for 3H, 0.37 ppm for 2H, 0.56 ppm for 1H, 0.23 ppm for 10 H proton and 0.85 ppm for 6OH at 275 K (Supplementary data 2). Several protons in ring A and D of the drug experience large upfield shifts, up to 0.55 ppm. It is worth noting that there is downfield shift up to 0.96 and 0.82 ppm for 40 H and 30 H, respectively. This is due to inversion of 40 H and 40 OH in 40 -epiadriamycin in comparison to adriamycin in which these shifts are 0.29 and 0.19 ppm, respectively. This may be due to better stacking of 40 -epiadriamycin with DNA. The maximum change in chemical shift with temperature is observed for 6OH, 11OH, 1H, 2H, 3H and 10 H protons (Supplementary data 4), which are presumably close to oligomer due to stacking of 40 -epiadriamycin chromophore with base pair of DNA. These have been attributed to intercalation of drug chromophore between base pairs of DNA, which move apart to a distance of $6.8 ≈ on binding to drug14,15 and are characteristic of stacking interaction between aromatic/conjugated rings. The relatively

smaller change in 1H and 2H protons of drug, also reported earlier,20≠22 may be due to specific positioning of drug chromophore between base pairs such that the ring A partially protrudes out of base pairs resulting in much lesser overlap with adjacent base

pairs and hence experiencing less ring current shifts. The base pair protons (H8, H6, H2, H5, CH3) and deoxyribose H10 protons (being close to aromatic ring) of the intercalating base pair of DNA show ring current effect to a much lesser extent since they are destacked

from the neighboring base pair in free DNA and then stacked with the conjugated aromatic rings ABCD (Fig. 1a) of 40 -epiadriamycin. The observed chemical shift at different temperatures (Fig. 3a and b) is distinctly different from that of free drug in monomer/self associated form21,22 or free DNA.23 These changes in chemical shift

may be due to structural alterations on binding and cannot be correlated directly to a specific structural parameter; hence not a sufficient marker of interaction. Therefore 2D NOESY data are acquired which gives inter-proton contacts and shows that the major conformer is the 2:1 molecular complex.

2.1.4. Conformational features of DNA and drug in the complex The NOESY spectra of drug≠DNA complex at stoichiometric D/N ratio of 1.0 have been investigated extensively at mixing time (sm) of 100, 200 and 300 ms. The inter-proton distances have also been 0 evaluated by taking distance CH5≠CH6 = 2.45 ≈ for sm = 200 ms as A an internal standard. The observed NOEs for (a) connectivities involving amino and imino protons of base pairs, (b) sequential connectivities (c) intranucleotide connectivities within sugar (d) intranucleotide base to sugar connectivities are given in Supplementary data 5≠7 and Table 2. 2.1.4.1. Connectivities involving amino and imino protons of base pairs. The base sequence d-(CGATCG)2 being self-complementary is responsible for a high symmetry in the NMR spectra. The observation of NOEs (Fig. 4a≠c, shown by arrow) between the C1H200 ≠G6N1Hb; G2N1Hf≠C5N4H2b; A3H2≠T4NHb; T4NHb≠ A3N6H2b establish Watson≠Crick base pairing between T1¡¡¡A6, G2¡¡¡C5 and A3¡¡¡T4 base pairs in the duplex showing that drug is stabilizing the duplex (Supplementary data 7). The sequential connectivities among adjacent base pairs, at the terminal ends where the binding site is present, are not observed (Table 2). This clearly demonstrates that DNA duplex is intact; apparently sequential connectivities are broken between base pairs to accommodate drug chromophore as expected on binding of typical intercalator to DNA molecule. 2.1.4.2. Sequential connectivities. The results in Table 2 clearly demonstrate a discontinuity in the (H6/H8)n to (H10 )n¿1, (H20 )n¿1, (H200 )n¿1, (H30 )n¿1, base (H6/H8)n¿1 sequential NOE connectivities expected in right-handed B-DNA geometries at the C1pG2 and C5pG6 steps (Fig. 4d and e and Supplementary data 8 and 9, shown by arrow) by the intercalation of anthracycline ring

of the drug. Intense NOE cross peaks are observed for several sequential connectivities between the steps, G2pA3, A3pT4 and T4pC5, as expected for right handed B-DNA type conformations. The intensities corresponding to these sequential NOE connectivities, (H10 , H20 , H200 )n¿1≠(base H8/H6)n are found to be in the range 2.3≠4.0 ≈ (Table 2). Thus the drug chromophore intercalates at C1pG2 and C5pG6 steps. The cross peaks A3H8≠G2H8 (5.0 ≈), A3H8≠T4CH3 (3.8 ≈), A3H8≠T4H6 (4.8 ≈) and T4H6≠C5H5 (3.9 ≈) have earlier been observed in the spectra of d-(CGATCG)223 and d-(TGATCA)2.24 These observations are indicative of good base to base stacking at these base pair steps. The stacking pattern in the base pairs adjacent to the intercalation site appears to have changed on complexation. 2.1.4.3. Intranucleotide connectivities within sugar. Sugar conformation may be determined from the integrals of cross peaks in NOESY spectra (Supplementary data 5) at 275 K. Intra residue inter-proton distances H10 ≠H40 and H200 ≠H40 distances vary significantly with PS and vS, respectively, hence may be used for conformational analysis. The NOE connectivity corresponding to H10 ≠H40 for G2 residue is weakly intense as compared to A3 and G6 residues (Supplementary data 5). This indicates that pseudo rotation phase angle for G2 residue is $162o. The observed distance from H10 ≠H40 NOE intensity (Supplementary data 5) increases in the order G6 < A3 < G2 and T4, C1, C5 are overlapped, hence cannot be resolved at sm = 200 ms. Thus the pseudorotation PS decreases as G2 > A3 > G6 so that the PS of G6 residue is estimated as <144∞. The distance H200 ≠H40 decreases rapidly from 3.8 ≈ for PS = 162∞ to 2.3 ≈ for PS = 18∞ while its variation with PS in the range PS = 144≠180∞ is negligible.25 The observed values of H200 ≠H400 distance (Supplementary data 5) show that G2, A3 and G6 have distance $3.8 ≈, hence the fraction of N-conformer is very less in the residues. All other observed intra-sugar NOE intensities (e.g., relatively higher value of H200 ≠H30 and H30 ≠H40 distance for G2 residue) are in agreement with these estimations of PS and vS and also indicate that G2 residue is closest to the B-DNA conformation. The observed intense cross peaks corresponding to H200 ≠H30 and H30 ≠ H40 distances show that the S-conformer is predominant. 2.1.4.4. Intranucleotide base to sugar connectivities. Among purines, H8≠H10 distance increases in the following order: G2 < G6 < A3 (Supplementary data 6), which shows v value of G2 residue is close to $105∞. Among pyrimidines, H6≠ H10 distance increases as C1 < C5 < T4 indicating that v value of C1 is close to $150∞ (Supplementary data 9, Fig. 4e and f). The H8/H6≠H200 NOE cross peaks show that the distance is least in G2 and C1 residues among the purines and pyrimidines, respectively, and thus these two residues may be adopting high anti conformation. The distance increases in the order G2 < G6 < A3 and C1 < C5 < T4 among purines and pyrimidines, respectively. Strong H8/H6≠H30 NOE connectivities indicate presence of mixed S and N-conformers in all the residues. Similarly intense cross peaks of base to H40 , H50 , H500 protons for several residues indicate presence of N-conformer along with major S-conformer in deoxyribose. 2.1.5. Conformation of 40 -epiadriamycin The intramolecular NOE connectivities within the drug molecule in the drug≠DNA complex give information about the conformation of drug (Supplementary data 10). It is observed that the 7H proton is nearly equidistant to 8axH and 8eqH atoms, but since the peaks are overlapped, their distance could not be accurately measured. In daunosamine sugar, the 10 H≠40 H and 10 H≠50 H distances are lesser than the corresponding distance in the free drug (3.1≠ 4.2 ≈). Thus the conformation of ring A as well as daunosamine sugar has changed due to binding. As a result the relative orientation of ring A protons with sugar protons is affected. The distance of 7H

to 10 H and 30 H have increased and corresponding NOE connectivity is not observed. The distance of a 9COCH2 proton from 10 H and 30 H proton has increased (no cross peak observed). Apparently, 9COCH2 has moved apart from daunosamine sugar moiety. Such changes are different from the one which have been observed in X-ray crystal structure of complexes of daunomycin with d-(TGATCA)2.13 It has been shown that conformation of ring A changes so that 9OH lies in close proximity to G2N2H and G2N3 atoms in order to form two hydrogen bonds. No such studies have been carried out for 40 -epiadriamycin in solution state by NMR techniques. 2.1.6. Intermolecular interactions Several intermolecular contacts have been observed in the NOESY spectra (shown with asterisk in Fig. 4a≠f and Supplementary data 8 and 9) of major conformer and are listed in Table 3.

The existence of NOESY cross peaks C1H6≠1H, C1H6≠2H, C1H6≠ 3H, G6H10 ≠1H, C5H6≠3H, C1NH2b≠9OH, C5H6≠1H, C5H6≠2H, G6H10 ≠6OH (intense NOE cross peak) and G6H20 ≠11OH (weakly intense cross peak) indicates that the drug chromophore stacks with C1 and C5 residues. Since the 4OCH3 proton is closer to C5H6 and C5H5 protons while 1H, 2H, 3H protons are close to C1H6 protons, the drug chromophore is oriented in a direction perpendicular to the long axis of C1.G6 and G2.C5 base pairs. As a result of stacking interactions, the 10 H atom of drug comes in close proximity of G6H10 and G6H20 atoms. The daunosamine sugar is in close proximity of third base pair as 50 CH3 shows NOE cross peaks with protons of A3 residue. We have selected some intermolecular NOE connectivities discussed above and also the intramolecular NOE connectivities within the drug and within the DNA molecule to build a model of drug≠DNA complex. The structure obtained after restrained energy minimization followed by restrained molecular dynamics for 100 ps is shown in Figure 5. It is observed that some of the NOEs observed between overlapping resonant peaks are possible as their corresponding distance in rMD structure is within 4.5 ≈. The structure derived by rMD simulations is indeed defined by experimental NOE restraints. The comparison of the distance obtained by NMR and rMD is given in Table 4. This geometry would lead to upfield shifts in ring D and ring A protons due to anisotropic ring current effects from the adjacent base pairs. This is consistent with the observed downfield shifts of 0.03≠ 0.21 ppm in 10 H, 7H, 10axH and 8axH protons. Ring A is seen to protrude out, somewhat towards the solvent and is consistent with the observed downfield shifts in 1H, 2H and 3H protons, being $0.6 ppm. On accommodating the aromatic chromophore of drug between adjacent base pairs, the overlap geometry is considerably altered leading to shifts in their resonance positions. The base pairs however are well stacked as demonstrated by appearance of NOE cross peaks A3H8≠T4CH3 and T4H1≠C5H5. We have derived the values of pseudorotation phase and glycosidic bond rotation in the rMD structure (Table 5a and b) and compared them with that obtained earlier in similar X-ray crystallographic structures.12,16,21 There are no such studies on binding of 40 epiadriamycin to d-(CGATCG)2 hexamer sequence by NMR techniques. Table 5a shows that T4 and A3 residues have pseudorotation phase angle of 126∞ and 107∞, respectively. Similar values in the range 121≠151∞ have been observed in complex of daunomycin and 40 -epiadriamycin with d-(TGATCA)213≠15 for T1, A3 and T4 residues. It may be noted that our NMR results indicate that deoxyribose sugar is a mixture of S- and N-conformers in dynamic equilibrium. The S-conformer exists as the predominant form having pseudorotation PS in the range 135≠162∞. Thus these results show the feasibility and relevance of NMR studies of 40 epiadriamycin bound to d-(CGATCG)2. Some of the features such as NOE connectivities A3H10 ≠50 CH3 and G6H10 /A6H10 ≠10 H are common to complexes with d-(CGATCG)2. But various other detailed structural features appear to be unique to the drug≠DNA complex studied. This reflects on drug-specific or DNA sequence specific interactions at molecular level and is relevant to differences in molecular basis of their action. 2.2. TCSPC analysis: time-resolved fluorescence measurements From TCSPC analysis, it is seen that the fluorescence decay curve profile of free drug is expected to be monoexponential26,27 but it is biexponential with two lifetimes and two amplitudes. The lifetime of free 40 -epiadriamycin is found to be s1 = 0.83 ns, s2 = 2.19 and amplitude is B1 = 0.06, B2 = 0.03. This shows that there may be presence of two conformers of the drug or the aggregation of the drug molecule. On the formation of d-(CGATCG)2≠40 epiadriamycin 2:1 complex, s01 º 0:71 ns, s02 º 1:08 ns; B01 º 0:01 and B02 º 0:08. In the present study the smaller B01 and higher B1

The very strong (ss), strong (s), medium (ws) and weakly (w) intense cross peaks correspond to distance of ss 1.8≠2.5 ≈, s 2.5≠3.0 ≈, ws 3.0≠3.5 ≈, w 3.5≠4.0 ≈, ww 4≠ 5 ≈. Overlap of peaks is indicated as o and `--' indicates absence of peak due to broadening.

Thus there is clear indication that 40 -epiadriamycin is intercalating in the d-(CGATCG)2 hexamer sequence and forming the complex. 2.3. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) studies on 40 epiadriamycin-d-(CGATCG)2 complex DOSY spectra of 40 -epiadriamycin-d-(CGATCG)2 complex of 2:1 D/N ratio is compared with that of 40 -epiadriamycin and d(CGATCG)2 alone at 275 (Fig. 7a) and 298 K (Fig. 7b). The calculation of diffusion coefficient was done using resonances, which got affected on interaction of drug with DNA. Hence 1H, 2H, 3H of drug and C1H6, G2H8 of DNA resonances had been taken into account. On complex formation, the diffusion coefficient value of the drug resonances in the complex decreases in comparison to that in the uncomplexed drug. The corresponding values of the drug resonances in complex and the drug alone are 0.27 ± 0.02 ¬ 1011 and 1.84 ± 0.05 ¬ 10¿11 m2/s, respectively, and that of d-(CGATCG)2 in the complex and alone hexamer are 2.61 ± 0.04 ¬ 10¿10 and 6.30 ± 0.08 ¬ 10¿10 m2/s, respectively, at 275 K. This is due to the interaction of the drug with DNA which slower the rate of diffusion. However, at 298 K, the diffusion coefficient value for the same hexamer signal for complexed and uncomplexed DNA are 2.25 ± 0.01 ¬ 10¿10 and 1.38 ± 0.04 ¬ 10¿10 m2/s, respectively, while that for bound and free drug resonance, the values are 5.11 ± 0.03 ¬ 10¿10 and 1.53 ± 0.07 ¬ 10¿10 m2/s, respectively. The diffusion coefficient values have been increased on comparing the complexed and the uncomplexed form. This may be due to the fact that the drug starts uncomplexing with increase in temperature. One set of peak is due to averaging of the diffusion coefficients. The exchange is slower at 275 K in comparison to that obtained at 298 K on the diffusion time scale. 2.4.

lifetime components represent the intercalated and free form of the drug, respectively. The s1 value (s01 º 0:71 ns) of the complex is less than that of s value (s1 = 0.83 ns) of free 40 -epiadriamycin, showing that there is shortening of the decay time of 40 -epiadriamycin due to intercalation (Fig. 6). This indicates the complexation of the DNA base with the drug and is due to electron transfer from the d-(CGATCG)2 to 40 -epiadriamycin. The s02 º 1:08 ns component may reflect the other conformations of unprivileged structures.

volve specific hydrogen bonding and van der Waal's interactions (Table 6). The root mean square deviation between the rMD structure and the starting structure is quite large but among various final structures is very low. This is an indication that convergence has been achieved. Table 7 indicates an assessment of refined structure in terms of energetics and distance deviation from the target distance. The total energy of the final structure is 146 kcal mol¿1, which is lower than the initial B-DNA structure. Table 8 shows the pair wise as well as residue wise root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the complex. The starting structure was chosen as reference and the value of target RMSD is chosen to be 0.0. It may be noted that distance deviation reached a minimum of 0.8 ≈ from an initial average deviation of 0.0 ≈. 2.4.1. Conformation of DNA All helical parameters, backbone torsional angles and sugar conformations of the resulting rMD structures were thoroughly analyzed with the program CURVES, version 5.1.28,29 The plots of helicoidal parameters (global unless specified otherwise) are made as a function of residue position in the duplex, along with that for the classical structures of A-DNA and B-DNA and are shown in Figure 9a and b. Among the base pair axis parameters, the x-displacement (dx) and y-displacement (dy) are found to vary to a large extent for all base pairs. The base pairs are inclined at an angle (g) up to 6∞,

the inclination being larger at 50 end. The tip angle fluctuates along the base sequence. The variation in shear, stretch, stagger, and buckle is fairly large for the CG base pair at both the ends. The propeller twist at either ends are negative and large, indicating that the ends are not having fraying effects. The inter-base parameters shift (Dx) and slide (Dy), vary in the range ¿0.16 to +0.07 ≈. The rise per residue (Dz) is 3.25 ≈ at A3pT4 base pair step while that at C1pG2 and C5pG6 base pair step increases up to 6.3 ≈ to accommodate drug chromophore. The intercalation results in large amount of tilt (s = 2.21∞ to ¿0.75∞) in base pairs. The roll angle (q) varies from +10∞ to ¿3∞. Positive roll opens the angle between the base pairs towards the minor groove; as a result a wider minor groove and bending towards major groove causing a curvature in the helix occurs. The large positive roll at C5pG6 (+10∞), step indicates reduced base stacking at C5pG6 end. This is due to the fact that intercalating anthracycline ring chromophore is oriented approximately perpendicular to the base pair axis in the helix, as found in the crystal structures of the complexes. The A3pT4 base pair step shows negative value of the roll (¿3∞). The propeller twist is in the range from ¿6∞ to 29∞ out of which the terminals are having negative value as the drug is intercalating at the terminal ends. The local inter base parameters also show positive roll angle at both the ends of the helix and negative roll in the center. The twist (X) varies in the range 30.1≠40.0∞. The twist angle values at the intercalation steps indicate that there is unwinding of DNA at these

steps. Also there is unwinding of DNA at the steps adjacent to the intercalation steps. The width and depth of major groove is found to be 12.48 and 4.53 ≈ while the corresponding values for minor groove are 6.05 and 5.00 ≈, respectively. Thus, the minor groove is wider perhaps to allow proximity of daunosamine sugar moiety. The backbone torsional angles along with the values for canonical B-DNA and A-DNA are plotted in Figure 10. The torsional angles a, b and c adopt gauche¿, trans and gauche+ conformations, respectively. The torsional angle f, however, deviates from the normal gauche-conformation and adopts a trans conformation for the G2 and C5 bases. This is due to the opening of base pairs at these sites. This is accompanied by a corresponding deviation in torsional angle e for G2 and C5 bases to a lower negative value of 91∞ and 100∞, respectively, as compared to a value to 155∞ found in B-DNA structures. The torsional angle, d as well as pseudorotation phase angle P, is deviated from the normal range around C20 endo conformation. The glycosidic bond rotation, v, of the DNA molecule measuring rotation of base around sugar varies along base sequence. The v angles are as follows: C1, 180∞; G2, ¿108∞; A3, ¿136∞; T4, ¿118∞; C5, ¿86∞; G6, ¿82∞. On C1pG2 side of the backbone, the 20 -deoxyguanidine residue on the 50 -end site changes the glycosyl angle from an anti (¿98∞ in B-DNA) to a

low anti value (¿108∞). At the same time by adjusting e angle from a near trans (155∞ in B-DNA) to a lower value (¿91∞), it allows the adjacent bases to separate from 3.4 to 6.3 ≈. On the C1pG2 side, both nucleotide units maintain the glycosyl angle at trans (180∞, ¿108∞). But the e value is changed from 155∞ to a near gauche (¿91∞) conformation in the G2 residue, it is possible to separate the neighboring G2 and C1 bases to a distance of $6.3 ≈. This can be achieved by coupling it with the rotation of the phosphodiester linkage from a normal gauche-, gauche-conformation to a trans, gauche-, as observed in X-ray crystallography12,30≠32 and NMR16 structures of similar complexes. The change in phosphodiester linkage gets reflected in the backbone torsional angles e, f, a and b. A correlation between these torsional angles has been found on the basis of a number of B-DNA crystal structures, which have shown that two conformational states are usually observed in B-DNA, namely BI and BII. The BI state is characterized by torsional angles a, ¿62∞; b, 176∞; c, 48∞; d, 128∞; e, ¿176∞; f ¿95∞; and v, ¿102∞ to ¿119∞; while the BII state is characterized by a, ¿62∞; b, 176∞; c, 48∞; d, 144∞; e, ¿114∞; f, ¿174∞; and v, ¿89∞. Our results show that both G2 and C5 residues tend to adopt BII conformation. The A3 and T4 residues remain in the more stable BI state. It has been reported earlier that the idealized

binding to similar drugs. The trans, gauche-conformation in G2pT3 or G2pA3 step in X-ray structure12,13 is associated with change in b angle of T4/A3 residue (adjacent to intercalating bases) to 120≠138∞. Further in these complexes, pseudorotation P = 105∞ for T4 residue or d angle of 72≠92∞ for A3 and T4 residues have been reported. The corresponding d or P for T4 residue in our case is 117≠126∞. Thus intercalation of 40 -epiadriamycin induces and stabilizes a distinct pattern of phosphates of the DNA backbone. There appears to be a possibility to directly influence the DNA backbone through complexation, hence leads to a redirection of intercalation caused structural changes to the backbone, as proposed in literature.17 2.4.2. Conformation of 40 -epiadriamycin The bond distance and angles in the 40 -epiadriamycin molecule are within the limits of accepted values. In the aglycon part of the molecule, the B and D rings are most aromatic with an averaged C≠ C distance of 1.40 ≈. The distance between O5 and O6 atoms and between O11 and O12 atoms are 1.75 and 1.88 ≈, respectively; they presumably form intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The aromatic part of the aglycon is quite planar with rms distance of 0.80 ≈ for the least squares plane calculated from all the atoms of rings B, C, and D without the exocyclic atom. The methyl group in the 4-methoxy side chain is also in plane with a deviation of 0.78 ≈. The orientation of methoxy group is such that the methyl group is pointed away from O5 atoms and protrudes into the solvent region. The torsional angles of the 40 -epiadriamycin molecule in the complex (Table 9) are different from that of daunomycin in the free state33 and in the same/similar bound complexes.12,31 In ring A, the torsional angles around C19≠C20 (5≠8∞) and C20≠C7 (28≠35∞) bonds are negligible while that around C8≠C9 (45≠50∞) and C9≠C10 bonds are (¿13∞ to ¿16∞) in magnitude. Thus, practically all atoms except C9 atom are out of the plane containing other atoms and aromatic rings B, C, and D. The C9 atom is displaced by 0.89 ≈ in same direction as the amino sugar relative to the plane of aglycon molecule as a consequence of which 9OH can no longer form intramolecular hydrogen bond with 7H atom. The torsional angles corresponding to O-glycosyl linkage, C20≠ C7≠O7≠C10 and C7≠O7≠C10 ≠C20 , are lower (¿137∞, 168∞) than the corresponding angles in the pyridine salt of daunomycin molecule34 in the free state (¿114∞, 167∞). The amino sugar is in a chair conformation with all the side chains pointing away from the aglycon. The torsional angle around C10 ≠C20 bond (39∞) is shorter than the expected gauche value in the six-membered rings. 2.5. Comparative analysis of 40 -epiadriamycin-d-(CGATCG)2 and other anthracycline≠DNA complexes A view showing the stacking interactions is shown in Figure 11. There are significant deviations from twofold symmetry relating the backbone of the B-DNA molecules. The G2.C11 base pair is translated towards minor groove by $1.3 ≈ and tilted with respect to A3.T10 base pair. The A3.T10 base pair is translated along long axis of the base pair by about 1 ≈ with respect to next base pair along 50 ≠30 direction. The drug is positioned with respect to DNA molecule (Fig. 12a and b) such that the hydroxyl oxygen atom of 9OH in ring A is within the hydrogen bonding distance of N3 and N2 atoms of guanine base G2. However, there is existence of weak hydrogen bonding. The distance between O9 and G2N3 atom is 3.93 ≈ and varies in the range 3.5≠4.7 ≈ in 100 structures saved at equal intervals during 100 ps rMD simulations. The distance of O9 from G2N2 atom is 4.01 ≈ and varies in the range 4.0≠4.5 ≈ so that this hydrogen bond is rather weak. O7 atom of 40 -epiadriamycin which links the chromophore and amino sugar, is close to N2 of G2 residue with the separation of 3.0 ≈ while O9 is far from O40 of G2

(4.2 ≈). The distance of O7 atom from O9 atom of 9OH hydroxyl group in ring A is 2.87 ≈ so that there is possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bond between O7 and 9OH. Apparently in order to have hydrogen bond of O9 with G2N3, the ring conformation is altered in a specific way, which moves O7 atom away.30 This hydrogen bonding interaction is likely to be sensitive to conformation of ring A. The distance between O9 atom of 9CO and O2 of C1 in our structure is 5.11 ≈ so that bridging of O9 atom of 9CO to O2 of C1 through water may not be possible. Further the distance between O4 and O≠1P of G6 is 8.97 ≈. However the distance between O5 and C5N1 is 3.24 ≈. A hydrogen bond involving O4 and O5 atoms with phosphate groups of G6 are possible through two water molecules acting as bridges between them. In our rMD structures these N≠H¡¡¡O distances from C5O2, C5O40 , and T4O2 atoms are 3.61, 3.98, and 4.76 ≈, respectively. We have therefore looked into these contacts throughout the course of simulations. It is found that the distance of NH3 ˛ from C5O2, C5O40 , and T4O2 are in the range 3.5≠ 4.3, 3.8≠4.3, and 3.9≠5.0 ≈, respectively. At the other intercalation site, the distance of NH3 ˛ from C11O2, C11O40 , and T10O2 are in the range 4.2≠4.9, 4.5≠5.1 and 4.6≠5.1 ≈, respectively. If we consider 3.5 ≈ as the cut off distance for hydrogen bond then NH3 ˛ moiety is able to make at the most two hydrogen bonds. The distance of NH3 ˛ from O40 of T4/T10 and N3 of A3/A9 are in the range 5.0≠6.5 and 4.5≠5.0 ≈, respectively, so that there are no contacts through hydrogen bonds between these groups of atoms, as seen in some X-ray crystal structures.13,30,31 An interesting feature of daunomycin/adriamycin/40 -epiadriamycin is its flexibility of O-glycosidic bond rotation C7≠O7≠C10 ≠ C20 . Throughout the course of simulations, we find that the O-glycosidic angle C7≠O7≠C10 ≠C20 remains within a narrow range of angles, 165≠180∞, and stabilizes at 168∞. In uncomplexed daunomycin and its analogues it is found to be 162≠16833,35≠37 while in the X-ray crystal structure of adriamycin complexed with d-CGATCG it is 148∞ and in some complexes, for example, 40 -epiadriamycin complexed with d-TGATCA and daunomycin with dCGATCG it is 132≠137∞.14,38 In most other crystal structures, it is 145≠161∞.15,31,32 The molecular dynamics simulations have however shown17 that a much lower dihedral angle, 57≠61∞, is also accessible. In the first conformation centered at 159∞, the nitrogen of the ammonium group is at a distance of 5.5, 5.1, and 3.2 ≈ from C5O40 , T4O2, and T4O40 , respectively, while in the second centered at 137∞, the corresponding distances are 3.2, 3.0, and >6 ≈, respectively. In the third conformation centered at 59∞, the distance of nitrogen of NH3 ˛ from G6O40 and G6O50 are 3.4 and 3.0 ≈, respectively. The energy barrier between 137∞ and 159∞ conformations is 0.3≠0.7 kcal mol¿1 and that between 137∞ and 59∞ conformations is 1.4 kcal mol¿1. Apparently in our case, the first and second substrates were kinetically readily accessible. The observed distance of nitrogen of NH3 ˛ from C5O40 /C11O40 , T4O2/T10O2, and T4O40 / T10O40 is in the range 3.1≠5.1 ≈ and that from G2O40 and G2O50 is in the range of 9≠12 ≈.

During the course of simulations, it is observed that hydrogen atom of 6OH group of ring B of 40 -epiadriamycin points towards O5 atom (that is away from O7 atom) in 98 out of 100 structures while hydrogen of 11OH points towards O12 and is away from C10 position. Apparently 6OH¡¡¡5O hydrogen bond is only stabilized in the drug≠DNA complex. This is similar to the existence of both hydrogen bonds in the uncomplexed daunomycin, adriamycin, and 40 -epiadriamycin investigated by us. The position of H atom of 6OH remains fixed and is not correlated to O-glycosidic bond rotation C7≠O7≠C10 ≠C20 which while varying in the range 165≠180∞, positions the daunosamine sugar moiety close to 6OH in different orientations. The stabilization of 6OH¡¡¡5O hydrogen bond thus ensures a fixed position of hydrogen atom of 6OH which has been found to be close to C5H10 (distance 3.24 ≈) of DNA. Besides this, several other contacts O5≠C5H10 , O6≠C5H10 , O5≠C5H20 , 4OCH3≠C5H20 , 6OH≠C5H10 , having distances within 4.0≠5.0 ≈, establish the involvement of 4OCH3, O5, O6, and 6OH atoms in stabilizing the drug≠DNA complex. Some of the contacts, also observed earlier,30 for example, 10axH with C1O2; 10eqH with G2N3; 30 H with G2N2; 20 axH with C5O2, have an important role in binding. 40 -Epiadriamycin drug differs from daunomycin by a hydroxyl group attached at C14 position, that is, presence of 9COCH2OH group as compared to 9COCH3 group in daunomycin and inversion of 40 OH at the daunosamine sugar moiety. In the rMD structure of the complex, it is observed that the hydroxyl group makes short van der Waal0 s contact with A3H50 (3.01 ≈) and A3H40 (4.89 ≈). Its distance from G2O30 and G2 phosphorus atom is 4.66 and 3.98 ≈ (Table 6), respectively. This group has been implicated in binding to phosphate through water bridge in X-ray crystal structure of adriamycin with d-CGATCG.12 Thus we find that 5O, 4OCH3, 6OH and O7 groups are involved in drug≠DNA interactions (Fig. 13). This may require existence of 6OH¡¡¡5O and 11OH¡¡¡12O hydrogen bond. Involvement of NH3 ˛ group in interaction is related to conformation of O-glycosidic bond. The binding to DNA through 9CO, 9OH, and 9CH2OH groups depends upon ring A conformation. Presence of 11OH¡¡¡12O hydrogen bond may not be critical for binding and atoms of position 1, 2, 3, 12, and 11 are not involved in drug≠DNA interactions. 2.6. Biological and medicinal relevance The anthracycline antibiotics are among the most effectual antitumor medicines used for medicinal treatment of various types of malignant tumors. It is well known that 40 -epiadriamycin is better tolerated, active against a variety of solid tumors with reduced cytotoxicity and lesser side effects. This drug is localized in the nucleus and shows cytotoxic and anti-mitotic activity. Orientation of the functional groups attached at C9 position on aglycone ring A and daunosamine sugar moiety was found to be different on the formation of the complex. The 40 -OH of daunosamine sugar forms additional hydrogen bonds as compared to that in daunomycin13,30,31 and adriamycin12 complexes. The role of drug≠DNA covalent bonding in cells was also investigated with synthetic epidoxorubicin≠formaldehyde (Epidoxoform) and synthetic daunorubicin≠formaldehyde (daunoform) conjugate. It was observed that the fluorophore of daunoform appeared more rapidly in cells and was released more rapidly from cells than the fluorophore of epidoxoform. Epidoxoform was found to be threefold more toxic to MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and greater than 120-fold more toxic to MCF-7/adriamycin resistant cells than that for epidoxorubicin.39,40 The cardiotoxicity of these anthracycline drugs are known to be due to the ability to generate oxygen radicals during redox cycling and in vitro reductive glycosidic cleavage through the formation of tautomer 7-deoxydaunomycinone.41,42 The kinetics of sugar moi-

ety detachment has been related to conformation of cyclohexyl ring A.43 The mass spectrometric studies44 on the anthracycline drugs have given a direct proof of negligible glycosidic cleavage in 40 -epiadriamycin. These results may well explain why 40 -epiadriamycin developed recently is better tolerated due to lesser cardiotoxicity than adriamycin and daunomycin.

downfield up to 0.9 ppm in the complex. Sequential NOE (nuclear Overhauser effect) connectivities between C1pG2 and C5pG6 steps are not observed as the drug chromophore intercalates at these base pair steps. Presence of several other intermolecular NOEs corroborates the same. BI≠BII transition has been detected at these base pair steps. The observed sequence dependant variations in DNA occur presumably to allow intercalation of the drug chromophore. The conformation of the drug also changes in order to have interaction with G2 base. Our studies establish the role of 9OH, 9CO, NH3 ˛ , 7O, 4OCH3 groups in binding to DNA. The observed NOEs and short interproton distances in the solution structure of







the complex confirm that the anthraquinone ring intercalates between CG base pairs excluding 3 base pairs adjacent to it. Besides this, lifetime measurement study has been done to show that there is shortening of decay time on complex formation. The DOSY spectral analysis also shows that the rate of diffusion decreases due to the binding of drug to DNA hexamer. The present study is the first rMD study on the solution structure of 40 -epiadriamycin with d(CGATCG)2 hexamer. The rMD simulations of 40 -epiadriamycin-d(CGATCG)2 complex based on intermolecular and intramolecular NOEs have led to a detailed conformational analysis. The intercalation of drug chromophore at d-CpG steps is stabilized by stacking

stitution in ring A or daunosamine sugar will affect the binding (and hence anti cancer action) as well as cell toxicity. These findings can provide leads for designing drugs of higher potency, reduced cell toxicity, and decreased resistance to tumor cell lines and hence find potential medical applications.

4. Experimental The deoxyribonucleic sequence d-(CGATCG)2 was purchased from Microsynth, Switzerland. Deuterium oxide (D2O), with isotopic purity 99.96% and 40 -epiadriamycin were purchased from Calbiochem Pvt. Ltd, San Diego, USA. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS), an internal NMR reference was purchased from Merck Sharp and Dohme Canada Ltd, Canada. All other chemicals like Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 and ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) are of analytical grade and purchased from E. Merck, India Ltd. Solution of 40 -epiadriamycin (88.33 mM) was prepared by dissolving a known quantity of sample in 90% water and 10% D2O. The final concentration is checked by absorbance measurements at wavelength of 480 nm using Cary Bio 100 Spectrophotometer. The extinction coefficient (e value used for 40 -epiae = 11,500 M¿1 cm¿1. Solution of driamycin is deoxyoligonucleotide, d-(CGATCG)2 (4.62 mM, duplex concentration) was prepared by dissolving a known quantity of sample in deuterated phosphate buffer (20.0 mM) of pH 7.0 having 50 mM Na salt. The sample of d-(CGATCG)2 was dissolved in 540 ll of deuterated phosphate buffer and 60 ll of D2O and its concentration was determined by absorbance measurements at 260 nm. Using extinction coefficient (e value = 57,200 M¿1 cm¿1. Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), 0.1 mM, was added to suppress any paramagnetic impurity, which may cause line broadening during NMR measurements. Typically 1 ll of 0.1 M solution of DSS was added to the complex of d-(CGATCG)2 and 40 -epiadriamycin as an internal reference. 4.62 mM d-(CGATCG)2 and 88.33 mM 40 epiadriamycin samples were taken as a stock solution for preparation of complex. A complex of d-(CGATCG)2 and 40 -epiadriamycin was prepared by titration. 65 ll of 88.33 mM 40 -Epiadriamycin was added in steps of 5 ll to 0.6 ml of 4.62 mM d-(CGATCG)2 sample during titration in order to make the complex of 40 -epiadriamycin: d-(CGATCG)2 D/N = 0.16, 0.32, 0.48, 0.64, 0.80, 0.96, 1.11, 1.27, 1.43, 1.53, 1.60, 1.75, 1.91 and 2.03. All proton NMR experiments were carried out at Central NMR Facility, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee and recorded on 500 MHz high resolution Bruker Avance 500 FT-NMR spectrometer equipped with computer having Topspin (1.3 version) software. Typical parameters for one-dimenpulse); sional NMR experiments are: pulse width = 10≠12.5 ls (30 no. of data points = 128≠256 K; spectral width = 5000 Hz; no. of scans = 64≠128 and digital resolution = 0.25≠0.5 Hz/point. Receiver gain was optimized in each instance to obtain the best signal to noise ratio. In temperature variable experiments, constant temperature is maintained in the range 275≠328 K using temperature control accessory. 2D phase-sensitive DQF COSY and NOESY experiments on d-(CGATCG)2 and its complex with 40 -epiadriamycin were carried out at 275 K in 90% H2O and 10% D2O. 2D NOESY experiments were recorded with variable mixing times (sm) 100, 200 and 300 ms for 40 -epiadriamycin≠d-(CGATCG)2 complex. Typical parameters for 2D experiments were: 2 K data points along t2 dimension; 512 free induction decays in t1 dimension; pulse width % 9.5≠12 ls; spectral width % 5000 Hz; no. of scans = 64≠ 128; digital resolution 2.30≠4.60 Hz/point and relaxation delay % 2.0 s. Cross peaks in the NOESY spectra were integrated and intensities were translated into inter-proton distances using H5≠H6 cross peak of cytosine as the reference distance = 2.46 ≈; a range of ±0.5 ≈ was provided to account for any error in integration. Pseudo atom corrections were used for methyl and other

equivalent protons. The NOEs were categorized as very strong (ss), strong (s), medium (ws) and weakly (w) intense with the corresponding distances set in the range of ss 1.8≠2.5 ≈, s 2.5≠ 3.0 ≈, ws 3.0≠3.5 ≈, w 3.5≠4.0 ≈, ww 4.0≠5.0 ≈ for the respective protons. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements: Time resolved fluorescence decays were obtained by the time-correlated single-photon counting method on the Spectrofluorometer (model FluoroLogTCSPC, make HORIBA Jobin Yvon Spex), used for the life time measurement study. The excitation source (kex = 470 nm) was a fixedwavelength Nano LED. The emission was detected at the emission wavelength (kem = 593 nm). The fluorescence emission of 40 -epiadriamycin and its complex with d-(CGATCG)2 was counted by a micro channel plate photo multiplier tube, after passing through the monochromator and processed through constant fraction discriminator (CFD), time-to-amplitude converter (TAC) and multi channel analyzer (MCA). All measurements were performed at 298 K in water. The fluorescence decay was obtained and further analyzed by using the software, DAS, provided by FluoroLog-TCSPC instrument. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY): The DOSY experiment is the measure of diffusion coefficients by NMR. The relation between translational self-diffusion and the measurable NMR parameters19 is:

all the structures were minimized by 1000 steps of Steepest Descent until a predefined convergence limit of root mean square derivative of <0.001 kcal mol¿1 ≈¿1 was reached.

where A is the measured peak intensity (or volume), A0 is the maximum peak intensity, Dt is the translational diffusion constant (in cm2/s), cH is the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton (2.675197 ¬ 104 G¿1 s¿1), d is the duration of the gradient, D is the time between gradients and Gz is the strength of the gradient (in G/cm). Data can be plotted as ¿ln (A/A0) versus c2 d2 G2 (D ¿ H z d/3). The slope of the line gives the value of Dt. The pulse program used is pulsed gradient spin echo (stimulated echo sequence incorporating bipolar gradients) sequence modified with binomial water suppression. The gradient strengths were incremented as a square dependence in the range from 1 to 32 G cm¿1. The diffusion time (D) and the duration of the magnetic field gradients (d) were 100 ms and 6 ms, respectively. Other parameters include a sweep width of 6000 Hz, 32 K data points, 1024 transients and an acquisition time of 2.7 s and relaxation delay of 2.0 s. It has been developed in order to facilitate the complex mixture analysis without physical separation. This experiment will monitor molecular events such as molecular interactions or associations. Restrained molecular dynamics methodology: The initial structure of d-(CGATCG)2 was built using the biopolymer module in INSIGHT II, version 2005 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, California) on Silicon Graphics Fuel workstation. The force constant was fixed as 40 kcal mol¿1 ≈¿2 for hydrogen bonds during the simulation. The energy of the molecule was minimized using 1000 steps each of Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient to remove any internal strain due to short contacts in starting structure using CFF91 force field in DISCOVER software version 2005 (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, California). Dielectric constant was fixed as 1.0 for calculation of electrostatic interactions. Conformational search was performed using the following simulated annealing restrained molecular dynamics protocol. The molecule was heated to a temperature of 800 K in steps of 100 K so that the chances of molecule being trapped in local minima become least and it can reach global minima. Molecular dynamics was carried out for 100 ps (1000 iterations with time step of 1 fs) at 800 K during which 100 structures were saved at regular intervals of 1 ps. Each of them was then slowly cooled at 300 K in steps of 100 K. The force constants for NOEs for strong, medium and weak peaks were held constant as 25, 15 and 10 kcal mol¿1 ≈¿2, respectively. At the end of simulated annealing
