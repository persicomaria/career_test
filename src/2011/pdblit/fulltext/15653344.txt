Abstract--N-Acetyl-b-D -glucopyranosylamine (NAG) is a potent inhibitor (Ki = 32 lM) of glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb), and has been employed as a lead compound for the structure-based design of new analogues, in an effort to utilize its potential as a hypoglycaemic agent. Replacement of the acetamido group by azidoacetamido group resulted in an inhibitor, N-azidoacetyl-b-D -glucopyranosylamine (azido-NAG), with a Ki value of 48.7 lM, in the direction of glycogen synthesis. In order to elucidate the ° mechanism of inhibition, we determined the ligand structure in complex with GPb at 2.03 A resolution, and the structure of the fully acetylated derivative in the free form. The molecular packing of the latter is stabilized by a number of bifurcated hydrogen bonds of which the one involving a bifurcated C­HÁ Á ÁNÁ Á ÁH­C type hydrogen bonding is rather unique in organic azides. Azido-NAG can be accommodated in the catalytic site of T-state GPb at approximately the same position as that of NAG and stabilizes the T-state conformation of the 280s loop by making several favourable contacts to residues of this loop. The difference observed in the Ki values of the two analogues can be interpreted in terms of desolvation effects, subtle structural changes of protein residues and changes in water structure.

Introduction Design of inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) with pharmaceutical applications in improving glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes is a promising therapeutic strategy.1­8 One of the early successes was the design and synthesis of N-acetyl-b-D -glucopyranosylamine (NAG, 1, Scheme 1), which inhibited GPb activity with a Ki = 32 lM.9 Extensive physiological studies showed

that NAG was an effective inhibitor of liver GPa in rat hepatocytes and that it was able to enhance the dephosphorylation (inactivation) of GPa,10­12 indicating a potential hypoglycaemic action. Information available from the crystal structures of T-state GPb­NAG ° ° complex at 2.3 A9,13 and recently at 1.9 A resolution14 has shown that NAG fits neatly into the so-called b-pocket, a side channel from the catalytic site, lined by both polar and nonpolar groups,15 and binding is stabilized through a strong hydrogen bond formed between the amide nitrogen and the main chain carbonyl O of His377. Upon binding at the catalytic site, NAG promotes the (less active) T-state conformation of the enzyme through stabilization of the closed position of 280s loop (residues 282­287), which blocks access of the substrate to the catalytic site. Following crystallographic analysis of NAG complex, a large

number of derivatives were synthesized and studied by X-ray crystallography with the objective to identify more potent inhibitors, but none of the analogues studied resulted in improved Ki values compared with the lead molecule.13 Introduction of a large hydrophobic group in the amide nitrogen of NAG led to a more effective inhibitor, N-(b-D -glycopyranosyl) 3-(2-naphthyl)propenoic acid amide (Ki = 3.5 lM), but no crystallographic studies have yet been reported.16 A better understanding of the mechanism of inhibition of GP

through identification of the target constraints that are related to the binding affinity of a candidate compound to the b-pocket should aid the design of improved inhibitors against GP. We report here on the kinetic and crystallographic experiments of N-azidoacetyl-b-D -glucopyranosylamine (azido-NAG, 2, Scheme 1) with GPb. Replacement of the acetyl group, in NAG, by an azidoacetyl group, resulted in a decrease of the inhibitory effect (Ki = 48.7 lM) on

GPb. To substantiate the mechanism of azido-NAG inhibition of the enzyme, we determined the crystal structures of azido-NAG in complex with GPb at ° 2.03 A resolution and its acetylated derivative in the free form using X-ray crystallography. The crystallographic results show that azido-NAG, as compared to NAG, on binding to the enzyme, makes additional contacts with the protein at the catalytic site that can provide a rationale for the kinetic properties of the inhibitor. 2. Results and discussion We have shown previously that NAG (1) is an effective competitive inhibitor of GPb with Ki value of 32 (±1) lM.9 The inhibitory efficiency of azido-NAG (2) was tested with GPb. The compound displayed competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate Glc-1-P, at constant concentrations of glycogen (1% w/v) and AMP (1 mM). The inhibition constant of azido-NAG (2) for rabbit muscle GPb is Ki = 48.7 ± 4.0 lM, approximately 1.5 times increased than that of NAG, indicating a difference in the binding energy between azido-NAG and NAG of about 0.25 kcal/mol. In order to elucidate the structural basis of this difference in affinity, we have undertaken the crystallographic investigation of GPb in complex with azido-NAG. A comparative study of the molecular conformation of azido-NAG (2) in the free state versus in complex with GPb was initially explored. While the efforts to crystallize azido-NAG using various solvents proved in vain, the corresponding tetra-O-acetyl derivative (3) crystallized from a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane as needles suitable for single crystal analysis. The details of crystal data, intensity data collection and structure refinement are given in Table 1. ORTEP depiction with atom numbering is shown in Figure 1 and the selected geometrical parameters are listed in Table 2. The C1­

N1 bond length is comparable with a value of ° 1.431(4) A reported for NAG.17 The N2­N3 bond length of the azido group is found to be longer than that of N3­N4. Such a trend has been observed earlier for the corresponding N­N bond lengths (1.234 and ° 1.130 A, respectively) in the crystal structure of azidoacetamide.18 The orientation of the acetoxy group at C6 is gg as evident from the torsion angles of O5­C5­C6­O6 (À67.3°) and C4­C5­C6­O6 (54°). The torsion angles, O5­C1­ N1­C7 and C1­N1­C7­C8, are À111.9° and À171.5°, respectively, which point out the Z-anti-conformation of the acetamido moiety. The conformation about the C7­C8 bond is syn with respect to the amido nitrogen (N1) and the azide group as shown by the torsion angle N1­C7­C8­N2 (6.5°). The value of the corresponding torsion angle in the case of simple azidoacetamide18 has been reported to be À2.9°. Careful analysis of the crystal packing was carried out in an effort to identify the key features governing the molecular assembly of the fully acetylated azido-NAG (3). Parameters of the various hydrogen bonds observed are listed in Table 3. Barring a single regular hydrogen bond involving N1­H and O7, all other intermolecular interactions are mediated by C­HÁ Á ÁO/N hydrogen bonds. Each of the two electron-rich nitrogens, N2 and N4 of the azide groups is involved in a bifurcated acceptor-type interaction with C1­H1 and C3­H3 and C12­H12A and C14­H14B, respectively (Fig. 2). To the best of our knowledge, such bifurcated C­ HÁ Á ÁNÁ Á ÁH­C type hydrogen bonding in organic azides has not been reported. The carbonyl oxygen, O7, is also involved in bifurcated acceptor type hydrogen bonding with N1­H1N and C12­H12C. Furthermore, the direct and bifurcated types of C­H interactions involving O6, O11 and O15 as acceptors lend further stability to the molecular packing.

(torsion angle O5­C5­C6­O6 is À57° for the GPb­azido-NAG complex and À67° for the free compound 3). The torsion angle N1­C7­C8­N2 is 179°. Thus, the conformation about the C7­C8 bond with respect to the amido nitrogen (N1) and the azide group turns out to be anti for the GPb­azido-NAG complex. The water structure within the catalytic site appears to play a significant role in stabilizing the ligand conformation (see below). The mode of binding and the interactions that azidoNAG makes with GPb are similar to those described ° previously for the lead molecule in the 1.9 A resolution 14 structure of the GPb­NAG complex. The hydrogen bond of the amide nitrogen (N1) with His377 O is retained, an interaction that is conserved in all b-D -glucopyranosylamine13,14,19,20 and spirohydantoin analogues21­23 of b-D -glucopyranose studied so far and also the compound 2-(b-D -glucopyranosyl)-benzimidazole.30 There are five additional hydrogen bonds in comparison to the GPb­NAG complex. N2, N3 and N4 atoms of the azido group [­N@N+@NÀ] make water-mediated interactions that involve residues Asn282, Asn284 and Phe285 of the 280s loop (residues 282­287), and Ala383 of the 380s loop (residues 377­384) (Table 5). In addition N4 is directly hydrogen bonded to His341 NE2 of the b-pocket, a sub-channel lined by both polar

and nonpolar groups, with no access to the bulk solvent.15 The nitrogen atoms of the azido group are involved in 11 van der Waals interactions with the GPb molecule. These contacts promote the closed geometries and give rise to increased rigidity of the 280s and 380s loops occurring in the T-state GPb. The hydrogen bonds formed between the azido-NAG and the protein are illustrated in Figure 6. There are in total 19 hydrogen bonds and 84 van der Waals interactions (7 nonpolar­nonpolar, 21 polar­polar, and 56 nonpolar/polar) (Table 6) in the GPb­azido-NAG complex. In the GPb­NAG complex there are in total 15 hydrogen bonds and 61 van der Waals interactions (6 nonpolar/ nonpolar, 10 polar/polar, and 45 nonpolar/polar).14 It is likely that some of these contacts particularly those ° between N4Á Á ÁCE1 His341 (3.1 A) and C8Á Á ÁOD1 ° ) represent CHÁ Á ÁN/O interactions. As Asn284 (3.3 A shown earlier, the acceptor and donor atoms, N4 and C8, of the fully acetylated azido-NAG (3) are also involved in C­HÁ Á ÁN/O interactions (Table 3). Although the solid-state conformation of the azidoacetamide moiety in the free and GPb-bound forms of azido-NAG (2) may be different, the above results reveal the potential of N4 and C8 to be involved in C­HÁ Á ÁN/O interactions. A structural comparison between the GPb­NAG complex and the GPb­azido-NAG complex shows that the

involved in hydrogen bonding networks may provide additional enthalpic interactions (Fig. 6). The azido-NAG analogue binds with a 1.5-fold decreased affinity relative to the lead compound NAG. The decrease in binding energy associated with azidosubstitution of the acetyl group of NAG is however paradoxical with respect to the increased number of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. It is possible that, in the GPb­azido-NAG complex, the energy gain due to the additional hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions is outbalanced by the energy required to desolvate the polar azido group in order to transfer it to the catalytic site. Another explanation for the energy difference (approx 0.25 kcal/mol) may lie in energy loss due to the ligand conformational entropy, as well as to the subtle conformational changes, that cannot be alleviated by a significant improvement on the ligand-catalytic site interactions.

Furthermore, Wat164 and Wat310 (Wat 109 and Wat355, respectively, in the NAG complex structure) ° shift away $0.4 A from the ligand to create more space for the azido group to be accommodated without causing steric hindrance.

obtain the former in crystalline form from several solvent systems proved in vain. X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature in the x À 2h scan mode on an Enraf-Nonius CAD4 diffractometer and the data collection and refinement parameters are given in Table 1. The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELXS-97 and the refinement was done by full matrix using SHELXL-97.25 ORTEP of the compound was drawn using WinGX26 and the packing diagrams using Mercury 1.4, provided by CCDC, Cambridge. Rabbit muscle GPb was isolated, purified, recrystallized and assayed as described.9 Kinetic experiments were performed in the direction of glycogen synthesis in the presence of constant concentrations of glycogen (1% w/v), AMP (1 mM), and various concentrations of Glc-1-P and inhibitor.14 Native T-state GPb crystals, grown in the tetragonal lattice, spacegroup P43212,27 were soaked with 100 mM azido-NAG (for 4 h) in a buffered solution (10 mM Bes, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 6.7), prior to data collection. Data for GPb­azido-NAG

complex were collected from a single crystal on Station ° 9.6 at Daresbury Laboratory to 2.03 A resolution ° ). The reflections were recorded on an ADSC (k = 0.87 A Q4 CCD detector. Data reduction and integration followed by scaling and merging of the intensities obtained was performed with Denzo and Scalepack, respectively, as implemented in HKL suite.28 Crystallographic refinement was performed with CNS version 1.129 using positional and individual B-factor refinement with bulk-solvent correction. The crystal ° structure of GPb in complex with oxadiazole at 1.92 A resolution30 was employed as starting model for refinement against the experimental data of GPb­azidoNAG complex. Electron density maps, (2Fo À Fc) and (Fo À Fc), were then calculated and indicated that azido-NAG was tightly bound at the catalytic site of GPb. The azido-NAG model was built using the coordinates from the single crystal structure of the fully acetylated azido-NAG (3) and was fitted manually in the electron density. Alternate cycles of manual rebuilding with the program `O'31 and refinement with CNS improved the quality of the model. The stereochemistry

of the protein residues was validated by PROCHECK.32,33 Hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions were calculated with the program CONTACT as implemented in CCP433 applying a distance cut-off 3.3 ° and 4.0 A, respectively. The Luzatti plot34 suggests an ° average positional error of approximately 0.22 A. Protein structures were superimposed using LSQKAB.33 The schematic representation of the crystal structures presented in all figures was prepared with the program XOBJECTS (M.E.M. Noble, unpublished results). The coordinates of the new structure have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb) with the code 2FFR.
