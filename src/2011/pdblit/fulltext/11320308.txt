Protein crystallization by rational mutagenesis of surface residues: Lys to Ala mutations promote crystallization of RhoGDI
Crystallization is a unique process that occurs at the expense of entropy, including the conformational entropy of surface residues, which become ordered in crystal lattices during formation of crystal contacts. It could therefore be argued that epitopes free of amino acids with high conformational entropy are more thermodynamically favorable for crystal formation. For a protein recalcitrant to crystallization, mutation of such surface amino acids to residues with no conformational entropy might lead to enhancement of crystallization. This paper reports the results of experiments with an important cytosolic regulator of GTPases, human RhoGDI, in which lysine residues were systematically mutated to alanines. Single and multiple mutations were introduced into two different variants of RhoGDI, NÁ23 and NÁ66, in which the ®rst 23 and 66 residues, respectively, were removed by recombinant methods. In total, 13 single and multiple mutants were prepared and assessed for crystallization and all were shown to crystallize using the Hampton Research Crystal Screens I and II, in contrast to wild-type NÁ23 and NÁ66 RhoGDI which did not crystallize. Four crystal structures were solved (the triple mutants NÁ23:K135,138,141A and NÁ66:K135,138,141A, and two single mutants NÁ66:K113A and NÁ66:K141A) and in three cases the crystal contacts of the new lattices were found precisely at the sites of mutations. These results support the notion that it is, in principle, possible to rationally design mutations which systematically enhance proteins' ability to crystallize.

1. Introduction
Established protein crystallization methods rely on systematic screening for suitable conditions, including various precipitants, pH values, additives, temperature etc. In many cases, thousands of conditions are tested during screening; new crystallization robots are expected to set up over 100 000 samples daily (Stevens, 2000). However, the effectiveness of crystallization experiments is not directly proportional to the number of conditions tested and current attempts at global enhancement of structure-determination methodology (structural genomics) urgently require improvements in crystallization effectiveness. It could be argued that the protein itself, rather than the precipitating agent, may be considered to be the most important variable in the screening process. Some proteins (e.g. lysozyme, insulin, hemoglobin) exhibit surface characteristics which lead to rapid crystallization under a variety of conditions, while other proteins have never been crystallized. Clearly, those proteins have surface properties that are not

The structural characterization of the obese protein leptin E100 (Zhang et al., 1997) was possible because the W1003E mutation allowed the preparation of good crystals. Histidine ammonia lyase was successfully crystallized by exchange of a surface cysteine residue to an alanine (Schwede et al., 1999). Very recently, D'Arcy and colleagues at Hoffman±La Roche used mutagenesis of surface residues in the DNA gyrase B subunit to study the effect of surface substitutions on the ability of the protein to crystallize and obtained new crystal forms (D'Arcy et al., 1999). In many cases, serendipity was a factor: the ®rst crystals of the chaperone GroEL were obtained after errors were introduced inadvertently at the PCR stage (Horwich, 2000). In spite of these results, the concept of crystal engineering has suffered from the lack of a rational approach: mutations were clearly recognized as a means to change proteins' solubility, but no rational protocol was ever designed to crystallize a new protein by surface mutagenesis. We hypothesized that mutagenesis of surface residues such as Lys and Glu to Ala or other smaller amino acids might systematically improve protein crystallization by creating epitopes more favorable for the formation of crystal contacts with negligible loss of conformational entropy. In this paper, we describe our initial testing of this approach on the human guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI. This physiologically important regulator of Rho-family GTPases has been previously shown to be recalcitrant to crystallization. RhoGDI is a single-chain protein made up of 204 residues, with a functional moiety restricted to the fragment 26±204 (Platko et al., 1995). In the absence of its target, Rho GTPase, residues 23±68 remain disordered (Gosser et al., 1997; Keep et al., 1997). Full-length protein and Nterminally truncated (Á23 and Á66) variants are all easily expressed in Escherichia coli using various fusion constructs (Shef®eld et al., 1999). A tryptic fragment (59±204) has been crystallized and its structure has been reported (Keep et al., 1997) revealing an immunoglobulin-like fold; no successful crystallization of either the Á23 or Á66 variants has ever been described. The protein contains 14 lysines (10%) and 12 glutamates (8%) in the globular domain (67±210), making it a good candidate to test the Lys3Ala (K2A) concept (Fig. 1). We show that K2A mutations notably improve the success rate in crystallization of RhoGDI using commercially available Crystal Figure 1 Screen kits from Hampton Overall structure of the ordered C-terminal domain of RhoGDI. Panels (a) and (b) show front and back Research. We also show that the perspectives of the -sandwich topology of the immunoglobulin-like fold as viewed through a transparent integrity of crystal lattices in the rendering of the molecular surface. The 14 lysine residues in this domain are highlighted in blue. favorable for the formation of crystal contacts. The possibility of using the protein as one of the variables in the process of screening for crystals has been suggested in the past. As early as 1972, it was proposed that if crystals of a target protein cannot be grown, homologous proteins from other species should be considered (Campbell et al., 1972). In this way, these authors crystallized nearly every enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, albeit from different organisms. Although this approach is still often used, there is no way to predict if a protein from one species is more likely to crystallize than that from another. Another approach, which has so far enjoyed less popularity, is to mutate surface residues in search of a variant more susceptible to crystallization. One of the ®rst examples of such protein engineering to promote crystallization was the work of Lawson and colleagues, who mutated human ferritin to generate crystal contacts analogous to those in the rat isoform (Lawson et al., 1991). This was followed in 1992 by a seminal study which showed that even single-site amino-acid substitutions in thymidylate synthase substantially affected the crystallization of the protein (McElroy et al., 1992). Since then, several examples of successful crystallization of mutants in lieu of wild-type proteins have been reported. During the studies of the HIV type 1 integrase, mutants in which hydrophobic residues were systematically replaced by lysines or alanines led to the identi®cation of a single-site mutant, F185K, which gave crystals used in the successful structure analysis (Dyda et al., 1994; Jenkins et al., 1995). It has been reported that different mutants of T4 lysozyme can be crystallized in as many as 25 different forms (Zhang et al., 1995).

2.5. Structure solution and refinement

Structures were solved by molecular replacement using the Ê 2.5 A resolution model of RhoGDI (chain A of PDB code 1rho) with the AMoRe program (Navaza, 1994). Molecularreplacement calculations on data from the Á23 triple mutant yielded two independent solutions better than any others, which upon proper placement relative to one another yielded a correlation coef®cient of 62 and an R factor of 37% for data Ê in the resolution range 12±4.0 A. Similar calculations on the Ê Á66 triple-mutant data (12±3.5 A) yielded a single solution with a correlation coef®cient of 49.8 and an R factor of 43%, whereas the values for the next best wrong solution were 21 and 53%, respectively. Molecular replacement on the Á66 single-mutant data sets yielded only one clear individual solution, but after ®xing this initial solution the second solution became apparent upon subsequent searches. The

combined solutions had a correlation coef®cient of 49.7 and an Ê R factor of 41.3% for data in the resolution range 10±4.0 A. The atomic models were re®ned against the structure-factor magnitudes using maximum-likelihood calculations implemented in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998); visual inspection of electron-density maps and rebuilding were performed using O (Jones et al., 1991). Solvent was identi®ed automatically in difference maps and added manually for the lower resolution structures. The solvent structure for the Á66 triple mutant was built using ARP in conjunction with REFMAC, both from the CCP4 suite (Murshudov et al., 1997; Perrakis et al., 1999). The stereochemistry of the models was evaluated with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and each was of acceptable quality. The results of the re®nement are tabulated in Table 3. Figures were produced using GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997) and MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

triple mutants and two quadruple K2A mutants (Table 1). No special rationale was used in the selection of sites; in particular, triple mutants were designed based on the proximity of selected sites to allow mutagenesis using a single set of primers. All mutants gave `hits' in either Crystal Screen I or II; ®ve preparations (K105A, K127A, K141A and both quadruple mutants) gave three to ®ve hits (Fig. 2; Table 4). It must be remembered that the Á23 construct contains a disordered N-terminal fragment over 40 residues long. Thus, at least in the case of RhoGDI, surface engineering appears to outweigh the negative impact of partial disorder. The Á66 construct, containing only the immunoglobulin-like domain, was used to generate two single mutants (K113A, K141A) and two triple Figure 2 mutants, both analogous to those tested in the Á23 construct. Microphotographs of selected crystals optimized from initial crystal hits. Again, all samples gave hits in the Hampton screens, with the (a) Á23 K135,138,141A triple mutant, CS1, 41.

Crystals were obtained from a variety of solutions, but most hits were found in ammonium sulfate, with or without additives and with a range of buffers. Crystals also grew from PEG of higher molecular weights, lithium sulfate and magnesium sulfate. In one case, crystallization was observed in 4.0 M sodium formate solution. Crystals of six of the mutants were assessed by X-ray diffraction using inhouse facilities. Two, Á23:K98,99,105A and Á66:K98,99,105A, showed large unit cells which were found to be impractical for fast investigation by molecular-replacement procedures. The remaining four exhibited acceptable unit cells and were pursued further (Tables 2 and 3). The choice was somewhat arbitrary, since probably any of the initial `hits' could have been optimized to yield large single crystals for X-ray diffraction. Two crystals selected for structure determination contain the triple mutation K135,138,141A, albeit in two different constructs with N-termini of various lengths. All four crystals were used Ê to collect data to $2.5 A using synchrotron radiation. It was subsequently found that the Á66:K135,138,141A mutant crystals diffracted signi®cantly better when an additional mutation L196F, originally designed to probe the functionality of the hydrophobic pocket of RhoGDI in an unrelated study, was introduced. This did not change the crystallization habit (i.e. the crystals are isomorphous with those of Figure 3 Stereoview of the molecular packing in crystals of the Á23 triple mutant.

3.2. The crystal structure of the D23 K135,138,141A mutant

The crystal structure of the Á23:K135,138,141A triple mutant was solved by molecular replacement and re®ned at Ê 2.7 A resolution to a conventional R factor of 21.3% (Rfree of 26.1%). This crystal form (space group R3) contains two protein molecules (denoted A and B) related by noncrystallographic twofold symmetry. The solvent content is Ê fairly high, re¯ected in a Matthews coef®cient of 3.1 A3 DaÀ1. The non-crystallographic dimer is formed by a tightly packed symmetric interface that is centered upon Arg134 and has

numerous van der Waals interactions, including the Ala135 introduced in place of a lysine (Fig. 3a). Adjacent to this interface, we ®nd another close contact between the A molecule and another B molecule, mediated by the epitope containing mutated sites 138 and 141. The nature of this interface is decidedly hydrophobic, with Pro85 of molecule B lodged between the C methyl groups of Ala138 and Ala141. The contact is further stabilized by the antiparallel association of two short stretches of main chain, so that two strong mainchain±main-chain hydrogen bonds are made: B87 CO to NH Ê Ê of A138 (2.97 A) and A136 CO to NH of B89 (2.96 A). It is quite clear that this close interface, involving primarily main-chain atoms, could not form with the wild-type lysines in positions 135, 138 and 141 (Fig. 3b). In addition to the contacts involving the mutated epitope, molecule B makes an additional extensive contact with an adjacent pair of symmetry-related A molecules mediated by the N-terminal fragment encompassing residues 56±65. This fragment, not present in the Á66 construct, wedges between the two A molecules in such a way that it forms an additional strand along one of the -sheets in RhoGDI. This interesting and extensive contact is obviously insuf®cient to generate crystals of the wild-type Á23 RhoGDI; it appears that the abovedescribed contacts involving the mutated 135, 138 and 141 sites play a critical role.

Stereoview of the molecular packing in crystals of the Á66 triple mutant. (a) Several molecules are shown from a view looking down the crystallographic threefold screw axis. The location of K2A point mutations are highlighted with magenta balls. (b) A close-up view reveals molecular interactions between two molecules related by crystallographic symmetry. This view is reminiscent of the packing of non-crystallographic dimers in the other crystal forms. For clarity, this view does not show the packing of two other crystallographically related molecules, which are also in close proximity and are apparent in Fig. 4(a).

In spite of the same set of surface mutations as the above sample, the shorter Á66 variant forms crystals exhibiting different symmetry, i.e. P3221. Although considerations based on the Matthews Ê coef®cient (VM of 4.6 A3 DaÀ1, assuming one molecule) initially indicated that two molecules may occupy the asymmetric unit in these crystals, subsequent molecular-replacement calculations persistently gave only one solution. This solution was subjected to re®nement using Ê data to 2.0 A resolution and the process converged well with a conventional R factor of 21.6% (Rfree = 23.2%). The packing diagram (Fig. 4a) shows how an elongated molecule of RhoGDI forms a stable crystal lattice mediated through crystal contacts involving residues at two opposite ends. The loop responsible for much of the crystal-forming interface is again precisely

the loop containing the triple mutation K135,138,141A (Fig. 4b). This interface brings into proximity two symmetry-related pairs of molecules, so that two molecules contribute the 135,138,141 loop while the other two are involved via the topologically opposite end. The resulting extensive interface is populated with small mostly hydrophobic residues with low conformational entropy, e.g. Val137, Val67, Ala153, Pro151, Ile122 and notably Ala135 and Ala138. There are few direct interactions and only three hydrogen bonds, all involving Ê main-chain atoms: 139 CO to 67 NH (3.2 A), 120 CO to Ê ) and 167 CO to 167 NH (3.2 A) from another Ê 174 NH (2.8 A molecule. Lack of a larger number of direct bonds confers a character of non-speci®city on this interface. The void spaces in this interface are ®lled with ordered water molecules forming local networks of hydrogen bonds.

contains a dimer which is conspicuously similar to the dimer found in the Á23 K135,138,141A mutant in that the two molecules insert the hydrophobic residues of the 169±170 loop into the hydrophobic cavity of the adjacent molecule (Fig. 5a). The rest of the dimer is largely free of crystal contacts, with the exception of the surface around Ala113, the site of mutation in one of the mutants. The limited contact in this area involves several residues of mixed character, involving Ala113, Val78 and a few neighboring residues from the A molecule packed against Pro85, Glu87 and Val78 in the symmetry-related B molecule (Fig. 5b). There are no immediately obvious direct hydrogen bonds at this interface, but water does ®ll the void spaces. In the K141A mutant, the contact retains its integrity, even though Lys113 now ®lls some space at the interface. Interestingly, the mutation site is distant from any crystal contacts and it is dif®cult to rationalize why the K141A mutant yielded this crystal form whereas other preparations of Á66 truncation mutants did not.
3.5. Overview of the structural data

The choice of Lys3Ala (K2A) mutations in this pilot study was dictated by many factors. Lysines are predominantly located on the surface, with 68% exposed, 26% partly exposed and only 6% buried (Baud & Karlin, 1999). In the case of RhoGDI, all of the lysines are either completely or partially exposed on the surface. On average, Lys is the most solvent-exposed residue in proteins. Statistically, these amino acids constitute 5.8% of the total amino-acid content in proteins, ranging from zero in rare and small acidic proteins to over 10% in some microtubule-associated proteins. It is important in this context to realise that even in a protein with average lysine content (5.8%) these amino acids constitute a large fraction of the surface area because nearly all are solvent accessible. Thus, even in a protein with an unknown fold, lysines provide markers for identifying a solvent-accessible site with a better than 90% success rate. Intuitively, we assume that the high conformational entropy of solvent-exposed lysines, $8 kJ molÀ1 (Avbelj & Fele, 1998), is likely to impair the formation of protein± protein contacts. This is supported by a recent study which shows that lysines constitute only 5.4% of interface surface in oligomeric proteins, compared with 14.9% of the total solvent-accessible surface Figure 5 (Conte et al., 1999).

in the interior, on the surface and at the interface in oligomeric proteins (Conte et al., 1999) and has no conformational entropy. With the exception of the K141A mutant, the structural data strongly supports our hypothesis that reduction of surface conformational entropy by mutagenesis can lead to the creation of epitopes thermodynamically suitable for the formation of crystal lattices. In the two triple-mutant structures, the sites of mutation are clearly involved in the crystal contacts and seem to be directly responsible for the crystallization habit of the protein. The crystal contacts involve numerous interactions between main-chain atoms, including hydrogen bonds between main-chain carbonyls and amides. It is not clear to what extent the K113A mutation was helpful in promoting the R32 crystal form. Although residue 113 is located at an intermolecular crystal contact, the remotely positoned K141A mutation leads to a similar packing arrangement with minimal changes to accommodate the lysine at position 113. While all K2A mutants proved more susceptible to crystallization efforts, we infer from the current data that multiple mutations are perhaps more likely to generate useful contiguous surface epitopes allowing the preparation of crystals in a variety of lattice arrangements. The structures solved in our study indicate that K2A mutations did not cause any signi®cant structural perturbations in RhoGDI. We have analyzed the structures of all mutants by overlapping them using a least-squares algorithm and calculating plots of C differences compared with the original search model (Fig. 6). In general terms, we note no signi®cant conformational changes arising from mutations, even in the mutants containing triple K2A substitutions located in close proximity along the polypeptide chain. Some deviations are observed in the C plots, but they are smaller than the differences observed for the 170 loop which is also involved in crystal contacts. There are only minor conformational changes in the side chains surrounding the mutation sites and they appear to be caused by crystal packing interactions rather than the mutations themselves. A comparison of the C coordinates in the two molecules of the triple Á23 mutants with the search model from the PDB Ê shows that the mean r.m.s. for the C positions is about 0.7 A, consistent with the limited resolution of both X-ray studies. Ê The largest deviation of nearly 2 A is found in the ¯exible loop that contains residue 170, a pattern that we also observe in other structures. The fragment containing the mutated sites shows slightly higher deviation than average and the two molecules differ somewhat in the extent of changes. Since this site mediates crystal contacts, it is dif®cult to judge if the observed differences are a consequence of mutagenesis or of the crystal contact. A comparison of C coordinates of the Ê 2.0 A resolution structure of the triple Á66 mutants with the Ê search model reveals an overall r.m.s. of approximately 0.75 A,  Ê . Many of the with few C atoms differing by more than 1.0 A differences are likely to stem from the relative inaccuracy of Ê the 2.5 A resolution search model. The C atoms of the mutated sites are within this range, while the largest discrepancy is again observed for the loop that contains residue 170.

tionship between the Lys3Ala mutations and enhanced crystallization of the RhoGDI mutants compared with the wild type. To date, site-directed mutagenesis has not been used widely to enhance crystallization, probably owing to the lack of established protocols that would provide guidance to the type of mutation that is required. The approach we propose is based on a hypothesis that residues with high conformational entropy may impede crystallization. Other factors may clearly contribute to the enhanced crystallizability of K2A mutants (e.g. removal of potential steric hindrance, alteration of electrostatic charge, the hydration shell etc.), but whatever the rationale, the important outcome of our study is the demonstration of a causal relationship between K2A mutations and crystallization. To establish whether that is indeed the case, we obviously need to test other types of mutations (involving, for example, Glu and Gln) and other protein systems. This work is under way. This work was funded by NIH grants HL48807 and NS36267. We would like to thank Drs Zbigniew Dauter, Jia Li and Yancho Devedjiev for help in collecting X-ray diffraction data at the synchrotron beamlines.

Similarity of the molecular interactions between various crystal forms of RhoGDI. A stereoview highlights the propensity of RhoGDI to form dimers, an arrangement that is evident in all crystal forms. Overlaying the structures (C traces) of one of the molecules from the dimer shows the relative placement of the other molecule. The crystals represented are of the wild-type (black), the Á23 triple mutant (red), the Á66 quadruple mutant (cyan) and the Á66 K113A single mutant (green). The location of residue 170 is highlighted in the aligned molecules with yellow spheres.

reveal no major changes when compared with the search model, again with the notable exception of the 170 loop, which Ê deviates by over 2 A. Parenthetically, we note that the RhoGDI molecules have a propensity to form non-crystallographic dimers in which the hydrophobic entrances to the central cavity face each other and in all crystal lattices a contact of this nature is evident (Fig. 7). The 170 loop, whose apex sequence is GMLA, is invariably in close contact with the residues lining the entrance in the adjacent molecule and its conformation is altered as the mutual disposition of the two RhoGDI molecules varies from dimer to dimer. This explains the observed conformational ¯exibility of the 170 loop seen in the different crystal lattices.

4. Conclusions
Our results strongly suggest that, at least in the model system of RhoGDI, K2A mutagenesis led to improved crystallization results. Out of the 13 various mutants, all gave hits and several gave diffraction-grade crystals in the ®rst screens. Furthermore, the structures of four mutants reveal that crystal contacts are in fact mediated by epitopes involving the mutated sites. These results strongly suggest a causal relaActa Cryst. (2001).
