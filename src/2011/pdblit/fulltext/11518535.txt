Abstract In the work described in this paper, 7-hydroxyflavone and chrysin were phosphoylated by a modified Atheron­Todd reaction. Three new phosphorylated flavonoids (PF) were obtained, and the structures of the target products were determined by X-ray and NMR data and electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectroscopy (MS). The mixed solutions of the phosphorylated flavonoids and different proteins such as insulin, lysozyme, and cytochrome c were injected in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The results show that all the phosphorylated flavonoids could form non-covalent complexes with the proteins mentioned above, while non-covalent complexes were not detected from the mixed solution of the chrysin or 7-hydroxyflavone with proteins. The research shows that the phosphorylated flavonoids could enhance the interaction with proteins. It may imply their important role in biological processes. The method described in this paper provides us additional information for studying such interactions for phosphorylated flavonoids in this important field. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Esters of phosphoric acid play a vital role in many biological processes and they appear to be synthesized and to undergo interconversion in living organisms with great ease [1­4]. In recent years, flavonoids have attracted increasing interest due to their various beneficial pharmacological effects [5,6]. We selected flavonoids such as 7-hydroxyflavone and chrysin to synthesize their phosphates through a simplified Atheron­Todd reaction. Three target products were obtained and their structures were determined by NMR data, X-ray data, and electrospray ionization (ESI) tandem mass spectroscopy (MS) for the first time. Three solutions of

the phosphorylated flavonoids (PF) were mixed with different solutions of proteins such as myoglobin, lysozyme, and bovine insulin, which were then injected individually into an ion trap mass spectrometer. The results show that the phosphorylated flavonoids could form non-covalent complexes with all the proteins. It was known that the development of electrospray ionization and the discovery that highly charged ions of proteins are readily formed has led to dramatic growth in the application of mass spectroscopy to bio-molecules [7­9]. Electrospray ionization is sufficiently gentle to allow the ionization of multi-unit protein structures [10,11]. It is an established fact that cellular functions are often triggered by weak non-covalent enzyme­substrate, protein­ligand, protein­protein or antibody­antigen interactions [12]. The results of ESI described in this paper may imply the special roles of phosphorylated flavonoids in biological processes.

The crystal structure of compound c is shown in Fig. 1. 7-Hydroxyflavone and chrysin were purchased from the Sigma Chemical Co. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL), bovine insulin, and cytochrome c were also purchased from Sigma and were used without further purification.

3. Mass spectrometric conditions Solutions of the complexes were analyzed on a Brukes-Esquire 3000 mass spectrometer fitted with an ion spray source working in the positive ion mode. Nitrogen was used as drying gas at a flow rate of 4 l min-1 . The neublizer pressure was 17 psi and the dry gas flow rate was 9.00 l ml-1 . The capillary was typically held at 4 kV. Six spectra were averaged, and the rolling average was seven. The ICC was set at 30,000. The samples dissolved were continuously infused into the ESI chamber at a flow rate 4 l min-1 using a Cole­Parmer Instrument Co. 744900 syringe pump.

4. Results and discussion Since its introduction, ESI-MS has served as a powerful tool in providing evidence in support of the existence of non-covalently associated macromolecular complexes in the gas phase. Due to its "gentle" nature, ESI has been utilized in the investigation of non-covalent complexes such as guest­host, antibody­antigen, enzyme­substrate, and small molecule-DNA interactions in the gas phase [12­16]. Detection of non-covalent complexes by ESI requires that the complex tolerates the interface conditions (i.e. heat, collisional activation due to electrical voltage) during the desolvation/desorption processes [14]. To successfully perform direct MS analysis of a preformed complex, the MS ionization technique must satisfy some criteria. The control of solution pH, organic solvent, and stabilizing buffer additives

is crucial to detect non-covalent complexes. In these experiments, solution conditions were adjusted appropriately; suitable orifice voltages and capillary temperatures were applied individually to different phosphorylated flavonoid-protein complexes. The corresponding mass spectra are shown in Figs. 2­4. From an experimental point of view, ESI of solutions near neutral pH was encouraged. Since decreasing solution pH has little effect on the observed charge distribution of [HEWL] [17]. A neutral solution of equine HEWL was used in the experiments for FP-HEWL complex detection. Fig. 2a shows an ESI mass spectrum obtained from a neutral solution of HEWL. The envelope of multiply protonated, multiply charged ions ranges from (M + 9H)9+ to the (M + 13H)13+ charge states of HEWL with (M + 11H)11+ being the most intense. The average molecular mass measured from these peaks is 14301 Da. These spectral characteristics are similar to those previously reported for the electrospray ionization of HEWL [18]. Fig. 2b shows an ESI mass spectrum obtained from a mixed solution of HEWL and PA. Besides the expected multiply protonated molecule ions, a mass spectrum revealed several groups of new protonated ions, corresponding to several kinds of highly charged multiple adducts, respectively, for example, ions at m/z 1139 and 1377, corresponding to (HEWL + PA)11+ and (HEWL + 2PA)11+ ; ions at m/z 1473, 1515, 1557, and 1599, corresponding to (HEWL + PA)10+ , (HEWL + 2PA)10+ , (HEWL + 3PA)10+ , and (HEWL + 4PA)10+ ; ions at m/z 1637, 1683, 1730, 1776, 1823, and 1869, corresponding to (HEWL + PA)9+ , (HEWL + 2PA)9+ , (HEWL + 3PA)9+ , (HEWL + 4PA)9+ , (HEWL + 5PA)9+ , and (HEWL + 6PA)9+ ; ions at m/z 1841, 1893, 1945, 1998, and 2050, corresponding to (HEWL + PA)8+ , (HEWL + 2PA)8+ , (HEWL + 3PA)8+ , (HEWL + 4PA)8+ , and (HEWL + 5PA)8+ . Fig. 2c shows an ESI mass spectrum obtained from a mixed solution of HEWL and PB. The mass spectrum also revealed several groups of new protonated ions, corresponding to several kinds of highly charged multiple adducts, respectively. For example, there is a set of ions at m/z 1633, 1677, 1720, and 1764, corresponding to (HEWL + PB)9+ , (HEWL + 2PB)9+ , (HEWL + 3PB)9+ , and (HEWL + 4PB)9+ . Fig. 2d shows an ESI mass spectrum obtained from a mixed solution of HEWL and PC. The mass spectrum revealed three groups of new protonated ions, for example, a group of ions at m/z 1635, 1680, 1725, 1769, and 1814, corresponding to (HEWL + PC)9+ , (HEWL + 2PC)9+ , (HEWL + 3PC)9+ , (HEWL + 4PC)9+ , and (HEWL + 5PC)9+ . It is well known that the ESI mass spectrum of a protein shows a series of protonated multiply charged ions with the charge distribution states relating to the conformational states [19­21] of the protein. A broad charge distribution shifting the signal to low m/z values corresponds to the denatured state, while a compact charge distribution at higher m/z values corresponds to the native state of the protein or the complex in solution [12]. All spectra shown in Fig. 2 were obtained under identical instrumental

conditions. So slight conformation changes of lysozyme could be detected with the HEWL­PF complex solutions. Our experiments showed that insulin was easily dissolved in dilute acetic acid, thus 0.5% acetic acid was used to prepare this protein solution. Fig. 3a shows an ESI mass spectrum obtained from bovine insulin solution. The spectrum shows a single distribution of peaks, with protonation states ranging from 6+ to 4+. The average molecular mass measured from these peaks is 5731 Da. Fig. 3b shows an ESI mass spectrum obtained from the mixed solution of bovine insulin and PA. Besides the expected multiply protonated molecule ions at m/z 956 (insulin + 6H)6+ , 1148 (insulin + 5H)5+ , and 1434 (insulin + 4H)4+ , a mass spectrum reveals five new protonated ions m/z 1231, 1315, 1539, 1643, and 1748, respectively, corresponding to (insulin + PA)5+ , (insulin + 2PA)5+ , (insulin + PA)4+ , (insulin + 2PA)4+ , and (insulin + 3PA)4+ ; the other ESI mass spectra (c) and (d) shown in Fig. 3 were taken from infusions of the solutions of the PB­insulin complex and PC­insulin complex, respectively. A series of new ions in Fig. 3c at m/z 1226, 1304, 1382, 1532, and 1629 corresponds to (insulin + PB)5+ , (insulin + 2PB)5+ , (insulin + 3PB)5+ , (insulin + PB)4+ , and (insulin + 2PA)4+ ; three new ions shown in Fig. 3d at m/z 1535, 1636, and 1736 correspond to (insulin + PC)4+ , (insulin + 2PC)4+ , and (insulin + 3PC)4+ . This result shows that the m/z region between the 5+ and 3+ charge states is the region of interest for detecting non-covalent complexes described in this work. Interestingly, no non-covalent complexes are observed in the m/z region between 6+ and 5+. Under identical instrumental conditions, no obvious conformational changes of insulin could be observed with the insulin­PF complex solutions. The solution of cytochrome c was prepared using a biological buffer 2 mM (ammonium acetate). The ESI mass spectrum (Fig. 4a) was taken from infusion of the solution of cyctochrome c, yielding an average molecular weight of 12356 Da. The result is consistent with a previous report; [22] the ESI mass spectrum (Fig. 4b) was taken from infusion of the solution of PA­cytochrome c complex. A series of ions at m/z 1066, 1162, 1200, 1278, 1320, 1421, 1467, and 1598 was detected, corresponding to (cytochrome c + PA)12+ , (cytochrome c + PA)11+ , (cytochrome c + 2PA)11+ , (cytochrome c + PA)10+ , (cytochrome c + 2PA)10+ , (cytochrome c + PA)9+ , (cytochrome c + 2PA)9+ , and (cytochrome c + PA)8+ . The

other ESI mass spectra (c) and (d) shown in Fig. 4 were taken from infusions of the solutions of the PB­cytochrome c complexes and PC­cytochrome c complex, respectively. Several groups of new protonated ions, corresponding to several kinds of highly charged multiple adducts of both PB­cytochrome c complexes and PC­cytochrome c complexes, are also clearly shown in Fig. 4c and d. The Fig. 4 shows that the peaks, corresponding to PA-cytochrome c, PB­cytochrome c, and PC­cytochrome complexes distribute evenly in the m/z regions between 12+ and 8+. Under identical instrumental conditions, no obvious conformation changes of cytochrome c could be observed with the cytochrome c­PF complex solutions. The experiment described above shows that CP could interact with all the proteins. Ratios up to 1:6 were observed in the case of the lysozyme­PB non-covalent complex whereas a 1:3 ratio was observed with insulin­PB complexes. These differences show the specificity of the different proteins. For comparison, 0.4 mM chrysin was also mixed with the protein solutions mentioned above such as insulin (0.04 mM, 0.5% HAc), HEWL (0.04 mM) and cytochrome c (0.04 mM) and infused individually to ESI. Even though different parameters were tried, no corresponding non-covalent protein-flavonoid complexes were detected. The experiments described herein suggest that the phosphorylated flavonoid could form non-covalent complexes with bovine insulin, HEWL, and cyctochrome c more easily than the unphosphorlated compound. We came to the conclusion that the phosphate groups of the phosphorylated flavones played important roles in the processes of FP­proteins interactions. The experiments described herein suggest that the phosphorylated flavonoids described in this paper could form non-covalent complexes with the proteins used in our experiments, while no non-covalent complex was detected when the methods were applied to mixed solutions of 7-hydroxyflavone or chrysin with the proteins. The result proved that phosphorylated flavonoids could interact and be preserved by these important proteins. Pharmacological tests were also performed in subsequent experiments. The relevant paper will be published later. The study of ESI-MS in this paper provides good information about phosphate ester­protein interactions. The result suggests that non-covalent associations of proteins and cofactors in solution can be preserved into the gas phase and observed by mass spectrometry.
