The biosynthesis of methionine is an attractive antibiotic target given its importance in protein and DNA metabolism and its absence in mammals. We have performed a high-throughput screen of the methionine biosynthesis enzyme cystathionine -lyase (CBL) against a library of 50 000 small molecules and have identified several compounds that inhibit CBL enzyme activity in vitro. These hit molecules were of two classes: those that blocked CBL activity with mixed steady-state inhibition and those that covalently interacted with the enzyme at the active site pyridoxal phosphate cofactor with slow-binding inhibition kinetics. We determined the crystal structure of one of the slow-binding inhibitors in complex with CBL and used this structure as a guide in the synthesis of a small, focused library of analogues, some of which had improved enzyme inhibition properties. These studies provide the first lead molecules for antimicrobial agents that target cystathionine -lyase in methionine biosynthesis.
Introduction The continuous emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbial pathogens requires a sustained effort to identify new antimicrobial compounds and new targets. Traditional targets such as the cell wall, nucleic acid, and protein synthesis remain robust candidates; however, these likely under-represent the potential targets available for antibiotic discovery. As a result, there has been a call for exploration and screening of noncanonical targets in antimicrobial drug discovery.1,2 Microbial amino acid biosynthesis is critical to cellular growth and therefore is an excellent candidate target for antimicrobial agents.3 Under conditions of systemic infection, amino acid concentrations are generally low (e.g., in serum4) and unable to support microbial growth. As a result, the biochemical pathways that catalyze amino acid production are engaged to meet the anabolic requirements of the infectious cell. Microarray analysis of gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli growing in minimal versus rich media confirms that amino acid biosynthesis pathways are up-regulated during logarithmic and stationary growth phases under conditions of low amino acid availability.5 Furthermore, proteomic analysis of genes expressed in typhoid fever and enteritis models of Salmonella enterica infection has shown that enzymes required for the biosynthesis of several amino acids such as methionine are expressed during infection.6 The potential of amino acid biosynthesis as an antimicrobial target has been validated both chemically and biochemically. For example, the antimicrobial compounds rhizocticin,7 azoxybacilin,8 2-amino-5-hydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid,9,10 and (6S)6-fluoroshikimic acid11 target various bacterial and fungal amino acid biosynthetic enzymes and gene expression. Furthermore, mutants in amino acid biosynthetic genes in both bacteria and fungi are impaired in their ability to cause disease.12-15 Methionine biosynthesis is an especially attractive target in this regard. Methionine is not only required for the synthesis of proteins but also vital to C1 metabolism via the synthesis of

the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine and is thus directly linked to DNA replication through thymine biosynthesis (Figure 1). Inhibitors of methionine biosynthesis therefore have the potential to impact both DNA and protein synthesis simultaneously, thereby amplifying their toxic effects. Moreover, most of the steps in this pathway are absent in mammals, lessening the opportunity of unwanted toxic side effects. The antifungal

agents azoxybacilin8 and 2-amino-5-hydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid9 target this pathway, and mutants in the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes have been shown to be avirulent in both bacteria and fungi.13,15 We have explored the importance of one of the enzymes required for methionine biosynthesis, cystathionine -lyase (CBL,a encoded by metC), in bacterial infection by deleting the gene in Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and have demonstrated that the absence of metC attenuates virulence in a mouse model of systemic infection.12 CBL is a ubiquitous microbial enzyme that cleaves cystathionine, generating ammonia, pyruvate, and homocysteine, the penultimate step in methionine biosynthesis (Scheme 1). Literature precedent linked the antifungal activity of anilinopyrimidine antifungal agents such as pyrimethanil to the inhibition of CBL;16 however, we have not observed direct inhibition of the purified enzyme with these compounds.12 Nevertheless, encouraged by our experiments linking CBL to bacterial virulence and because chemical inhibitors of enzymes in methionine biosynthesis can have antimicrobial activity as discussed above, we reasoned that a high-throughput screen of CBL could identify small molecules that could serve as enzyme probes or leads in antimicrobial agent development. Given that the enzyme requires an electrophilic pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor for catalysis, we designed the high-throughput assay to include a preincubation period with potential inhibitors to specifically ensure that compounds with slow-binding properties could be identified in the screen.

Results High-Throughput Screen of CBL. We screened E. coli CBL in duplicate against a 50 000-compound small-molecule library from Maybridge Plc. to identify potential inhibitory molecules. The Z factor for the screen, a statistical measure of the effective separation of the high and low controls, was 0.54, indicating that this assay was highly suitable for screening.17 Figure 2 shows a plot of the residual activities of the duplicate screen. We set the hit cut off at 20%, which resulted in 28 potential hits, a 0.056% hit rate. Hit Analysis. An IC50 analysis was performed on all 28 putative hit molecules from the primary screen. This identified 13 confirmed inhibitors of CBL with well-behaved IC50 curves (Table 1). We noted that eight of these showed changes in the visible spectra of CBL and free PLP (e.g., Figure 3). Seven of these (compounds 1-7) were hydrazides or sulfonhydrazides, which are known to interact with the cofactor of PLP enzymes, and one, compound 8, was an oxime. We reasoned that the surprising interaction we observed with 8 was the result of hydrolysis of the oxime to generate hydroxylamine in situ that interacted with the PLP cofactor. The visible spectrum of CBL in the presence of NH2OH was identical to that of 8 and CBL (not shown). Compounds 9-13 did not alter the UV-vis spectrum of CBL. Rather, they behaved as typical reversible inhibitors with mixed inhibition (Table 2). This type of inhibition means that the

compounds bind to both the free enzyme and the enzymesubstrate complex and are therefore not likely to bind to the active site. Structure of CBL in Complex with Compound 1. CBL was cocrystallized with compound 1, and the 3D structure of the complex was determined to 1.8 Å resolution (pdb code 2GQN) (Table 3, Figure 4A). The conditions used to obtain the inhibitor-bound CBL crystals were similar to those reported by Clausen et al.18 for the determination of the PLP-bound enzyme. CBL exists as a tetramer in solution;19 however, in the C2221 crystal, a dimer was observed within the asymmetric

unit. The complete R4 tetramer as shown in Figure 4A is assembled by combining two dimers related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. Excellent detailed descriptions of the entire CBL structure from both E. coli18 and Arabidopsis20 have been reported; therefore, only a brief description is given here. Four equivalent active sites exist within the CBL tetramer. Each active site contains a single PLP cofactor molecule bound deep within a cleft formed between equivalent dimer interfaces (Figure 4A). Thus, residues from two monomers orchestrate substrate binding and catalysis at a given active site. In the absence of substrate, PLP remains covalently bound to lysine-210 via a Schiff base18 (Figure 4B). Currently, no crystal structures are currently

available for CBL in the presence of either substrate or product; therefore, it is difficult to comment on the possibility of significant domain movements that may take place during the course of the reaction. The fact that significant differences in the CR positions of CBL were not observed (rmsd ) 0.3 Å) between inhibitor-bound (pdb 2GQN) and -unbound structures (pdb 1CL1) suggests that large domain movements may not be required during the course of the reaction. Crystals grown in the absence of 1 were yellow because of the presence of bound PLP. However, when soaked in a solution containing 1 mM 1 these crystals became clear within 10-15 min. This color change is consistent with the spectral shift observed upon hydrazide formation when 1 reacts with bound PLP in CBL. The crystal structure confirmed the expected covalent complex between 1 and PLP. The observed CdN bond joining PLP and 1 is well ordered in the final model and has an average B value of 15.7 Å2 and a reasonable bond length of 1.28 Å. Examination of the structure revealed that the 2-nitrobenzamide moiety of 1 was located in a hydrophobic pocket of the protein flanked by Tyr56, Tyr238, Tyr338, and Phe55 (Figure 5A). No direct hydrogen bonding was observed between CBL and the 2-nitrobenzamide group. The active sites of both monomers within the asymmetric unit were fully occupied by

revealed only minor changes in the overall geometry and position of the amino acid side chains within the active site region. The most significant changes involved Lys210 and PLP (Figures 4B and 5A). Upon covalent bond formation with 1, PLP was released from its covalent interaction with Lys210. This resulted not only in a 35° rotation of PLP about the plane of the pyridoxal ring but also in a reorientation of the Lys210 side chain, bringing it into hydrogen-bonding distance of both Ser339 and Tyr56 (2.7 and 3.0 Å, respectively). Even in the presence of 1, the deep substrate-binding cleft of CBL was not fully occupied. At least 15 ordered water

molecules were located in the substrate-binding cleft. In principle, several of these water molecules could be replaced by modifications made to 1. Thus, there is considerable potential to improve upon the affinity and certainly the specificity of 1-CBL interactions. Synthesis of Derivatives of Compound 1. We reasoned that a focused library of derivatives of 1 that retained the reactive acetic hydrazide group but varied the benzamide function to explore possible additional binding in the hydrophobic pocket could improve binding affinity. We therefore prepared 14-23 and measured their interaction with purified CBL (Table 4). Naphthyl substituents (22 and 23) were poor inhibitors of the enzyme, whereas most benzamide derivatives were comparable to 1. The 2,3,5-trifluoro-4-methoxy-benzamide (21) and the 2-trifluoromethyl derivative (18) showed nanomolar IC50's and retained PLP binding activity. Therefore, we next determined the 3D structure of 18 in complex with CBL. A comparison of the 3D structures of 1 and 18 in complex with CBL revealed a number of similarities (Figure 5). As expected, both compounds occupied the same general space within the complexes, burying essentially identical surface areas (difference ) 33 Å2). The anchoring effect of PLP in combination with the relatively short tether greatly limited the possibility of any dramatic alterations. Compound 18 underwent a 180°

rotation of the benzene moiety that positioned the electronegative trifluoromethyl group away from the solvent and into contact with Tyr238 and Arg58. In addition, Tyr111 made a new hydrogen bond contact with the N4 atom of 18. Thus, compared to 1, 18 makes three additional hydrogen bonds with CBL without the loss of van der Waals contacts. These changes reflect the observed differences in the IC50 measurements for 1 and 18. Because the binding of 18 leaves 15 or more water molecules in the substrate-binding cleft of CBL, one would expect increased affinity and specificity for CBL by further modifications to 18 if these could displace the ordered waters. Characterization of Slow-Binding Inhibition. Compounds 1-7 and 14-23 bind to the PLP cofactor of CBL as assessed by UV-vis absorption spectra (e.g.,Figure 3). Such interactions are frequently suggestive of slow-binding inhibition.21-23 Slowbinding phenomena can be classified into two general mechanisms: one in which the slow formation of the stable enzymeinhibitor complex (EI*) occurs without kinetic accumulation of the EI inhibitor-enzyme collision complex (mechanism A) and one where it does (mechanism B):

We first examined the slow-binding behavior of 5 because it was readily available and showed good inhibition. The progress curves for the generation of homocysteine were consistent with slow the development of an EI h EI* equilibrium (Figure 6A).23 The progress curves were next fit to eq 2 to provide a measure of kobs, the first-order rate constant for the formation of EI* and replotted as a function of the inhibitor concentration (Figure

6B). This plot did not show saturation kinetics but gave a straight line. Such a relationship is consistent with mechanism A. From this steady-state analysis, k3 was determined to be 0.34 nM-1 min-1, k4 was 0.026 min-1, and the dissociation constant Ki* was 76 µM. Attempts to determine the steady-state slow-binding characteristics of 18 using this approach were problematic because of the rapid formation of the ESI* complex. We therefore used a stopped-flow approach to measure the formation of the covalent complex directly by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 430 nm.21 Using 5, a plot of kobs versus [inhibitor] gave a straight line with a k4 (y intercept) of 0.002 s-1 and a k3 (slope) of 0.08 nM-1 s-1. Ki* was estimated from k4/k3 to be 30 µM. Using 18, we obtained a k4 of 0.033 s-1, a k3 of 5 nM-1 s-1, and a Ki* of 6.2 µM. The differences between the kinetic constants measured by steady state and stopped flow for 5 could be the result of the differences in the assay pH used in the two studies. It does suggest that mechanism A is likely not adequate in explaining the interactions of the molecules with CBL and that there is likely a contribution of a low-affinity collision complex to the process such that mechanism B is a more reasonable model despite the lack of saturation in the kobs versus [inhibitor] plot. Such differences have been noted previously for slow-binding inhibitors of CBL21 and have been similarly rationalized. In such a case, the Ki describing the formation of the EI complex is much larger than the Ki* and the range of inhibitor concentrations sampled in the experiment, thereby explaining the absence of saturation kinetics. Despite these discrepancies, the overall trend that 18 is a much more effective inhibitor of CBL than 5 as determined by IC50 determination is supported by the stoppedflow analysis. The inhibition by these compounds was slowly reversible (e.g., the regained activity of CBL inhibited by 5 was 13% over 2 h). This is consistent with the crystal structures of 1 and 5 in complex with the enzyme in which there is no additional covalent interaction except with the PLP cofactor. Antimicrobial Activity. A selection of the hit compounds identified in the screen was examined for antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans and against E. coli (Table 5). Several of the hydrazine compounds and 8 showed modest activity against E. coli, whereas only 12

exhibited antifungal activity against C. albicans in the presence and absence of methionine. Antimicrobial activity did not correlate with CBL IC50's. Summary and Conclusions. A high-throughput screening of bacterial CBL has identified reversible and slow-binding inhibitors of the enzyme, some with antimicrobial activity. Analysis of the X-ray structure of the complex of CBL with 1 confirmed the expected formation of the PLP adduct and established the synthesis of a small library of analogues. One of these, 18, exhibited a 50-fold improved inhibition of CBL. This was a surprising result because 1 and 18 differ only by the substitution of a trifluoromethyl group in 18 for the nitro group at position 2 of the benzamide ring in 1. The 3D structure of the complex of 18 with CBL revealed that this small change resulted in an 180° rotation of the benzamide ring in the CBL active site, facilitating the formation of a new H-bond between Tyr111 and 18. Additional analogues of 18 that take advantage of this H-bonding opportunity could have improved activity. These results demonstrate that improved inhibitors of CBL can be discovered with a combination of 3D complex determination and library synthesis. Unfortunately, CBL inhibition did not correlate well with antimicrobial activity. There could be myriad reasons for this, including transport into the cell, efflux, and metabolism. Future work will require an understanding of this discrepancy. Although we have shown that antimicrobial activity did not track well with CBL affinity in this study, the fact that CBL is important to virulence and methionine biosynthesis and is tractable in high-throughput screening and structure-based drug design demonstrates that this enzyme has significant potential as a new antimicrobial target. When set on a backdrop of increasing antibiotic resistance and a paucity of new agents and targets, this research provides encouragement that amino acid biosynthetic pathways are worthy of exploration in antibiotic development. Experimental Procedures
Materials. E. coli CBL12 and VanHst24 were purified as previously described. The small-molecule library was purchased from Maybridge Plc. (Cornwall, England) and is composed of highquality small druglike molecules of an average molecular mass of 325 g/mol. High-Throughput Screen of E. coli CBL. Enzyme activity was measured by titration of the formation of homocysteine at 412 nm using 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). The screen was per-

formed on a Beckman/Coulter-SAGIAN core automated system (Beckman/Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA) at the McMaster High Throughput Screening Laboratory in 96-well polystyrene plates. Each well contained 3.25 mM 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and 24 nM CBL in 50 mM TAPS at pH 8.5. Library compounds dissolved in DMSO were added to a concentration of 10 µM (based on an average molecular mass of 325 g/mol), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Substrate cystathionine (CTT) was then added to 100 µM, and the reaction was monitored continuously for 4 min using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The final volume was 100 µL, and the final concentration of DMSO was 5%, which does not affect CBL activity. High controls (100% enzyme activity) contained only DMSO, and low controls (0% enzyme activity) lacked CBL; each compound in the library was tested in duplicate. Enzyme activity was calculated in ActivityBase (IDBS) from the slope of the data between 30 and 200 s. The residual activity was calculated as [(sample data - mean of low controls)/(mean of high controls - mean of low controls)] × 100. A statistical analysis of the screen was performed using the Z and Z parameters.17 Hit Analysis. Compounds were considered hits if the residual activity of CBL was below 20% for both replicate measurements. Outliers (where one replicate was a potential hit and the other was not) were rescreened in duplicate. The IC50's of the hit compounds were determined in triplicate using 12 concentrations of the compound under the conditions used in the primary screen except for the concentration of 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) maintained at 1 mM.

Hit molecules that showed good IC50 behavior (well-defined plateaus, slope factor close to 1) and that were not titrating the PLP cofactor were further analyzed with a full Ki determination in triplicate using a range of CTT concentrations from 25 to 600 µM. For compounds containing groups that react with DTNB, a confirmatory assay was developed that coupled pyruvate generation with NADH reduction by VanHst.24 Each assay contained 24 nM CBL, inhibitor in DMSO, 100 µM CTT, 100 µM NADH, 60 µg/ mL VanHst, and 50 mM TAPS at pH 8.5. The assays were monitored at 340 nm. The reversibility of the inhibition was confirmed by dilution and overnight dialysis. The interaction of the compounds with the PLP cofactor of CBL was assessed by measuring the absorbance spectrum between 300 and 500 nm on a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. These studies were performed using 20 µM purified CBL in 25 mM HEPES at pH 7.5 in a total volume of 0.8 mL. Slow-binding studies were carried out by monitoring the activity of CBL over time in an assay mixture containing 12 nM CBL, 5% DMSO, 1500 µM CTT, 3 mM DTNB, 50 mM TAPS at pH 8.5, and 0 to 1000 µM inhibitor. The reactions were monitored at 412 nm using a SpectraMax Plate Reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The data were fit to eq 2 P ) Vst + (V0 - Vs)[1 - exp(-kobst)]/kobs (2)

Slow-binding studies were also conducted using a stopped-flow apparatus. Rapid mixing was achieved using a BioLogic stopped flow SFM-400 mixer and an MPS-50 controller (Molecular Kinetics, Seattle, WA). The reaction was monitored at 430 nm using

For 5, the assay contained 12.7 µM CBL, 0 to 0.5% DMSO, 0 to 1250 µM compound, and 25 mM HEPES at pH 7.5. For 18, the assay contained 19.8 µM CBL, 0 to 1% DMSO, 0 to 300 µM compound, and 25 mM HEPES at pH 7.5. The data were fit to eq 3 A ) AS + (A0 - AS)exp(-kobst) (3)

where t is time, A0 and A are the absorbances at time zero and time t, respectively, and AS is the final steady-state absorbance. The individual rate and inhibition constants were determined from replots of kobs versus [inhibitor]. Synthesis of Inhibitors. All benzoic acids and acid chlorides were from Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, ON, Canada). Hydrazine (anhydrous) was from J. T. Baker Chemicals Co. (Phillipsburg, N.J.). 2-Chlorotrityl resin, Fmoc-glycine, and Nhydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) were from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride was from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). 3,5-N-Di-t-butyl-protected benzoic acid and 2-N-t-butylprotected naphthoic acid were synthesized using standard procedures.26 Purity of the compounds was monitored by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (Acclaim TM120 column, 3 µm 120 Å, 4.6 × 150 mm2) using water-acetonitrile gradients with 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as a counterion. The identity of all products was verified by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry (LC/ES-MS) analysis performed on QTRAP-LC/MS/ MS (Applied Biosystems). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained on a high-resonance electrospray time-of-flight mass spectrophotometer (TOFMS ES+). 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on a Bruker AV 200 NMR spectrometer, and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s ) singlet, d ) doublet, t ) triplet, m ) multiplet), integration, and coupling constant (Hz).

Two different approaches were taken to synthesize analogues of hit molecules: first, compounds were synthesized on a solid support (method A), and then the most successful ones were scaled up using solution-phase synthesis (method B or C) (Scheme 2). Solid-Phase Synthesis (Method A). The 2-chlorotrityl resin was first derivatized with hydrazine (10 eq) followed by Fmoc-GlyOH (10 equiv) activation and coupling using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide(DCC)/hydroxybenzotriazole(HOBt). Substitution was estimated to be 0.2 mmol/g resin. After Fmoc deprotection, the resin was divided and reacted with corresponding benzoic acid derivatives. Finally, hydrazides were cleaved from the resin with 10% TFA/dichloromethane for 2 h at room temperature. All products were purified using reversed-phase HPLC (C18). Solution-Phase Synthesis Employing Acid Chlorides (Method B). This approach was modified from a literature method.27 To a solution of glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride (0.66 g, 4.8 mmol) and triethylamine (0.53 g, 5.2 mmol) in 10 mL of diethyl ether was added a solution of corresponding benzoyl chloride (4.8 mmol) in 10 mL of diethyl ether. The reaction was carried out for 4 h at room temperature. The precipitate formed was filtered out and dissolved in absolute ethanol (10 mL), and to this solution was added anhydrous hydrazine (0.5 mL). The reaction was carried out for 4 more hours. After solvent evaporation, the crude product was purified using reversed-phase HPLC. Solution-Phase Synthesis Employing Mixed Anhydrides (Method C). N-t-Butyloxycarbonyl-protected acid (1.8 mmol) was coupled to glycine ethyl ester using the isobutylcarbonic acid mixed anhydrides procedure as described before.26 The dry residue was dissolved in 5 mL of ethanol, and 0.5 mL of hydrazine was added to this solution. The reaction was carried out for 4 h at room temperature and then concentrated under reduced pressure, suspended in 5 mL 50/50 acetonitrile/water, and lyophilized. The crude, dry product was subjected to Boc deprotection in a solution of dichloromethane (5 mL), TFA (2.5 mL), triisopropylsilane (0.2 mL), and water (0.2 mL) for 1 h at room temperature. After solvent

Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs). MICs of hit compounds were determined in duplicate over a test range of 0.25-128 µg/mL by broth microdilution methods accord-

ing to the NCCLS guidelines for using both bacterial and fungal test organisms in M9 medium with and without added methionine and in synthetic complete medium without methionine, respectively. Crystallization and X-Ray Structure Determination of CBLInhibitor Complexes. Crystals of CBL-inhibitor complexes were grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization conditions were similar to those previously reported in Clausen et al.18 Specifically, CBL was concentrated to 5 mg/ mL in 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), and inhibitor was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Large (0.6 mm × 0.6 mm × 0.2 mm) single crystals grew at room temperature within 1 week upon mixing 2 µL of the protein solution, 2 µL of the precipitant solution containing 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM CaCl2, and 26% PEG400. To obtain the highest-quality diffraction data, the crystals were soaked sequentially in the following two cryoprotecting solutions for 14 h and 5 min, respectively: cryosolution I (100 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM CaCl2, 30% PEG400, 8 mM inhibitor) and cryosolution II (100 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mM CaCl2, 30% PEG400, 16 mM inhibitor). The crystals were flash frozen by transferring them directly into a nitrogen cold stream (100 K). A single X-ray diffraction data set was collected using an RAXIS4++ image plate detector and Cu KR radiation from an RU300 rotating anode (Rigaku MSC). The apparent focal-spot size was set to 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm. Reflection data were processed, scaled, and reduced using D*trek28 and truncated using CCP4 (Leslie, 1990). Because the CBL-inhibitor crystals grew in the same space group (C2221) and with the same unit cell parameters (a ) 59.6 Å, b ) 153.0 Å, c ) 151.2 Å) as native CBL (pdb code1CL1), the native phases were used to solve the structure. Iterative cycles of refinement and model building were performed with the programs REFMAC29-32 and Coot,33 respectively. The final models each contain two monomers of CBL in the asymmetric unit, each bound to a single inhibitor molecule. Analysis of the Ramachandran plots for these models calculated by PROCHECK34 indicated that in both cases 92.6% of the residues are in the most-favored regions with the remaining 7.4% located in the allowed regions. Crystallographic data and final refinement statistics can be found in Table 1. Figures illustrating the structure of CBL were generated using the PyMol Molecular Graphics System.35
