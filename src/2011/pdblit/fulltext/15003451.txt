Abstract The ubiquitous purine nucleoside phosphorylases (PNPs) play a key role in the purine salvage pathway, and PNP deficiency in humans leads to an impairment of T-cell function, usually with no apparent effects on B-cell function. This review updates the properties of the enzymes from eukaryotes and a wide range of prokaryotes, including a tentative classification of the enzymes from various sources, based on three-dimensional structures in the solid state, subunit composition, amino acid sequences, and substrate specificities. Attention is drawn to the compelling need of quantitative experimental data on subunit composition in solution, binding constants, and stoichiometry of binding; order of ligand binding and release; and its possible relevance to the complex kinetics exhibited with some substrates. Mutations responsible for PNP deficiency are described, as well as clinical methods, including gene therapy, for corrections of this usually fatal disease. Substrate discrimination between enzymes from different sources is also being profited from for development of tumourdirected gene therapy. Detailed accounts are presented of design of potent inhibitors, largely nucleosides and acyclonucleosides, their phosphates and phosphonates, particularly of the human erythrocyte enzyme, some with Ki values in nanomolar and picomolar range, intended for induction of the immunodeficient state for clinical applications, such as prevention of host-versus-graft response in organ transplantations. Methods of assay of PNP activity are reviewed. Also described are applications of PNP from various sources as tools for the enzymatic synthesis of otherwise inaccessible therapeutic nucleoside analogues, as coupling enzymes for assays of orthophosphate in biological systems in the micromolar and submicromolar ranges, and for coupled assays of other enzyme systems.

1. Introduction Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP, E.C. 2.4.2.1) catalyzes the cleavage of the glycosidic bond of ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides, in the presence of inorganic orthophosphate (Pi) as a second substrate, to generate the purine base and ribose(deoxyribose)-1-phosphate. For the natural substrates, the reaction is reversible, as follows:
b À purine nucleoside  Pi @ purine base A aÀDÀpentoseÀ1Àphosphate

Thermodynamically, the equilibrium of the reaction is shifted in favour of nucleoside synthesis, and in the case of the mammalian enzymes, the equilibrium constant is $ 50 (e.g., Friedkin, 1950). However, in vivo phosphorolysis is highly favoured over synthesis, due to coupling with two additional enzymatic reactions, viz. oxidation and phosphoribosylation of the liberated purine bases by xanthine oxidase (Xox) and hypoxanthine ± guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), respectively. PNP is a ubiquitous enzyme of purine metabolism that functions in the salvage pathway, including even those of protozoan parasites, thus enabling the cells to utilize purine bases recovered from metabolized purine ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides to synthesize purine nucleotides (see Fig. 1; Section 2.1). The PNPs from various sources are members of a broader class of N-ribohydrolases and transferases, the transition states (TSs) for which share ribosyl oxocarbenium-like character, with cleavage of the C ± N ribosyl bond (Schramm, 1997, 1999). PNP was discovered and briefly characterized by Friedkin and Kalckar (Kalckar, 1947a, 1947b; Friedkin, 1950; Friedkin & Kalckar, 1961). It has been considered as a primary target for chemotherapeutic intervention since the discovery by Giblett et al. (1975) that a child suffering from lymphopenia, and with severely defective T-cell, but normal B-cell, immunity, exhibited a total lack of PNP activity. The symptoms of PNP deficiency immediately suggested possible chemotherapeutic applications of potent inhibitors of this enzyme, as selective immunosuppressive agents to suppress the host versus graft response in organ transplantation, treatment of T-cell leukemias, countering Tcell-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythe-

matosus and rheumatoid arthritis (e.g., Kazmers et al., 1981; Stoeckler, 1984). PNP inhibitors are also the center of interest for potentiation of the antitumour and antiviral activities of nucleoside analogues, which, following administration, must reach the target cell and undergo phosphorylation in order to manifest their activities. Many of these analogues are substrates of, and are subject to cleavage by, PNP before reaching the cell and undergoing phosphorylation. Differences in specificity between PNPs from Escherichia coli and humans have been profited from for the development of so-called tumour-directed gene therapy (Sorscher et al., 1994; Hughes et al., 1995; Nestler et al., 1997). This, in turn, has focused attention on the search for PNPs from different sources with specificities differing from that of human erythrocyte PNP, with a view to optimization of such therapy and for other clinical applications. Although the reverse, synthetic pathway has been much less studied, PNPs from various sources, mainly bacterial, have been widely exploited as tools for the enzymatic

synthesis of nucleoside antimetabolites that are difficult to prepare, or are obtained only in low yields, by chemical syntheses (Section 8.3). Because of its intrinsic role in the functioning of organisms and its numerous practical applications, PNP has been the subject of a number of reviews (Parks & Agarwal, 1972; Parks et al., 1981; Stoeckler, 1984; Kredich & Hershfield, 1989; Markert, 1991; Montgomery, 1993), largely limited to the properties of human erythrocyte PNP, its inhibitors, and clinical aspects. During the past few years, many new developments have been reported, such as the discrimination of specificities between the enzymes from various sources, mechanisms of action, and the potential use of these enzymes in gene therapy. This has been accompanied by reports on the high-resolution three-dimensional structures of the enzymes from human erythrocytes, calf spleen, E. coli, and a Cellulomonas sp. (Bzowska et al., 1995a; Ealick et al., 1990b; Koellner et al., 1997, 1998; Mao et al., 1997, 1998; Narayana et al., 1997; Tebbe et al., 1999) and their use for delineating the mechanism of action of these enzymes, as well as for design of more effective inhibitors. Furthermore, striking progress has been reported, largely by Schramm and co-workers (Kline & Schramm, 1992, 1993, 1995; Miles, et al., 1998), in the design of potent TS analogue inhibitors, highly relevant to clarification of the mechanism of action of the enzymes, and with Ki values in the picomolar range considered necessary for therapeutic applications. PNP has also proven useful as a tool for continuous determination of inorganic phosphate concentration in biological systems and in coupled assays for other enzyme systems. These, and other developments, are the subject of this review. 2. Role of purine nucleoside phosphorylase in physiology of an organism 2.1. Metabolic role The ubiquity of PNP and its distribution in various tissues and cells were documented long ago by Parks & Agarwal (1972) and Stoeckler (1984). In humans, the highest activities are found in the kidney, peripheral lymphocytes, and granulocytes. However, based on cell volumes, red cells display the same activity as peripheral lymphocytes. Hence, human erythrocytes, deficient in de novo synthesis of purines and consequently dependent on salvage of the latter, are the richest source of PNP. In contrast, erythrocyte PNP levels are considerably lower in mice, rats, and other animals, an important factor in extrapolating from laboratory animals to humans (Stoeckler, 1984). In the alimentary tract of mice, the highest levels of purine catabolic enzymes, including PNP, are in the proximal small intestine (Mohamedali et al., 1993). In intact cells, PNP functions in the direction of phosphorolysis (Fig. 1), leading to degradation of purine nucleo-

sides via coupling with guanase and Xox. It is of interest, in this context, that the histochemical localization of PNP in rat and human liver cells is strikingly similar to that of Xox (see Frederiks et al., 1993), which converts Hx to urate via xanthine (Fig. 1). PNP functions also as a salvage enzyme of the purine substrates required by HGPRT to synthesize the monophosphates (MPs) of Ino and Guo. a-D-ribose-1-phosphate (R1-P) may be converted to ribose-5-phosphate, a precursor of 5-phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate (PRPP), a co-substrate of HGPRT. It is noteworthy that, with the intervention of adenosine deaminase (ADA), both ribo- and deoxyribonucleosides are converted on the PNP pathway to form only ribonucleotides (Fig. 1), so that subsequent production of deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis is limited to their synthesis by the allosterically regulated enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 2). The apparent irreversible conversion of xanthine to urate, as shown in Fig. 1, may require re-examination in light of the finding of Ipata and co-workers (Giorgelli et al., 1997) that, when using as a source of enzyme crude extracts of rat liver, which also contain guanase activity, the xanthine stemming from guanase deamination of the guanine liberated by phosphorolysis of Guo is at least partially converted to xanthosine via recycling of R-1-P by PNP. In accordance with this, replacement of Pi (4.5 mM) in the incubation medium by arsenate virtually abolished formation of xanthosine. The same reaction was shown to occur in an in vitro reconstituted enzyme system containing purified calf spleen PNP and guanase.

The foregoing authors apparently were unaware that a similar reaction had been reported almost 50 years earlier in a publication that has escaped attention (Friedkin, 1952), using a partially purified PNP, also from rat liver, and known to contain guanase activity. With dGuo as substrate for phosphorolysis, Friedkin (1952) isolated from the reaction mixture, in crystalline form, the cyclohexylamine salt of the then unknown 2H-deoxyxanthosine. This, in turn, was found to be a weak substrate of rat liver PNP, its rate of phosphorolysis being 2% of that for dGuo, and is relevant to subsequent sundry reports (e.g., Tsuboi & Hudson, 1957) on the substrate properties of xanthine and xanthosine with PNP from mammalian sources. Ipata and co-workers further demonstrated that in rat liver and brain extracts (Giorgelli et al., 1997; Cappiello et al., 1998; Mascia et al., 1999), the activated R-1-P stemming from phosphorolysis of Ino and Guo, may be transferred to uracil, presumably by uridine phosphorylase (UP), followed by phosphorylation of Urd to uracil nucleotides. Furthermore, in rat brain extracts, R-1-P stemming from uridine appears to be used for salvage of Ade and Hx to their nucleotides (Mascia et al., 2000). This points to a possible additional role of PNP in salvage of purine and pyrimidine bases. It remains to be determined whether these reactions proceed in intact cells. Transfer of the pentose ring between purine bases by PNP in vitro has been demonstrated in a number of instances (Section 3.4.3), and such transfer reactions, coupled with pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases (PyNPs), have been widely employed for the in vitro synthesis of purine nucleoside analogues not readily accessible by chemical synthesis (Section 8.3). 2.2. Human purine nucleoside phosphorylase genome, mutations, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency The human PNP gene, spanning 9 kb of genomic DNA, has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 14q13. Its mRNA comprises 1700 nucleotides within six exons, leading to a protein of 289 amino acids, with an Mr of 32.15 kDa for each subunit of the functionally active trimer (Ricciuti & Ruddle, 1973; Goddard et al., 1983; Williams et al., 1987; Jonsson et al., 1991; Markert, 1991). Regulation of PNP gene expression was proposed by Mohamedali et al. (1993) to occur at the level of mRNA synthesis, based on a correlation between enzyme levels in various tissues of the murine alimentary tract and the corresponding levels of mRNA. With the use of abbreviated PNP genes, Jonsson et al. (1992, 1994) demonstrated that human PNP gene expression in vitro at the mRNA and protein levels is dependent on the presence of intronic sequences, and varies directly with the number of introns present. PNP deficiency, first described by Giblett et al. (1975), is a rare disorder associated with an autosomal recessive form of cellular, but not humoral, immunodeficiency, and comprises $ 4% of all cases of severe-combined immunodeficiency (SCID).

The mutant PNP genotypes responsible for this disorder have been identified in a number of patients, and those described up to 1997 were compiled by Markert et al. (1997). Several additional ones have been reported by Pannicke et al. (1996) and Sasaki et al. (1998), and are listed in Table 1. These include missense and frameshift mutations, but, as pointed out by Markert et al. (1997), the most common appears to be the point mutation Arg234Pro. In light of what is now known about the three-dimensional structure of human erythrocyte PNP (see Section 4), it will be seen that some of the mutations listed in Table 1 affect the active site, for example, substitution in exon 3 of Glu89, which is proposed to form a catalytic triad Glu89 ± His86 ± Pi (Erion et al., 1997a), or loss of His257, which is a component of the ribose-binding pocket, as a result of a 1-bp deletion in exon 6, leading to a reading frameshift and premature translation termination after 260 amino acids. The latter mutation is accompanied by loss of residues 265 ± 281, which, in the native enzyme, form a C-terminal helix involved in formation of a trimer (Ealick et al., 1990b). Structure ± function studies of single-point mutants of human erythrocyte PNP are discussed in Section 5. Snyder et al. (1997) have described the recovery of three PNP mutants from the progeny of mutagen-treated mice. All three were point mutations, Met87Lys, Ala228Thr, Trp16Arg, not affecting active site residues, and with erythrocyte enzyme levels of 4.6%, 1.5%, and 1% those of normal mice. Each mutation resulted in

impairment of T-cell differentiation in proportion to the level of enzyme deficiency, overall qualitatively similar to that in the human disorder. Such PNP-deficient mice appear to provide a promising animal model for investigation of the associated metabolic defects, as well as of gene therapy approaches. Clinical presentations of homozygous PNP deficiency in humans include various recurrent infections and severe lymphopenia in the first 2 years of life. T-cell populations and function are reduced, whereas B-cell function is usually preserved, and occasionally hyperactive. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia and neutropenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and B-cell lymphomas are observed in such patients. Neurologic abnormalities have been reported in more than 50% of PNP-deficient children (see Gilbertsen & Sircar, 1990; Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995). Major metabolic aspects of PNP deficiency are hypouricemia and hypouricosuria, with concomitant elevated urine and plasma levels of PNP substrates. In the normal human organism, phosphorolysis of dGuo markedly exceeds that of its phosphorylation (Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995), as also in various tissues of the mouse (Snyder et al., 1994). PNP deficiency in humans is accompanied by increased phosphorylation of dGuo, resulting in accumulation of dGTP, a potent feedback inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, in thymocytes and erythrocytes, and a decrease in the level of GTP. Numerous studies have shown that T-lymphoblast mutants with enhanced levels of ribonucleotide reductase or with ribonucleotide reductase resistant to inhibition by dGTP are less sensitive to the toxic effects of dGuo, which leads to a decrease in the dCTP pool; a protective effect of dCyd, presumed to act by maintaining the dCTP pool, is observed. The foregoing led to the proposal that T-cell defects in PNP deficiency are due to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by the feedback inhibitor dGTP, thus largely inhibiting reduction of CDP and, consequently, DNA synthesis (see Fig. 2), resulting in impaired T-cell maturation and differentiation. Specific T-cell, rather than B-cell, impairment is attributed to a higher level of deoxycytidine kinase activity in T-cells and a protective effect in B-cells of high nucleotidase activity versus deoxynucleotide 5H-phosphates, so that dGTP accumulates in T-cells, but not in B-cells. dGuo toxicity is a proliferation-dependent phenomenon, operative during T lymphocyte development or when mature T-cells undergo division. Proliferation-dependent T suppressor cell functions are lost, while proliferation-independent T-helper cell activity may be retained (Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995). Although accumulation of dGTP, and resultant inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, was long considered to account for selective T-cell immune deficiency, Duan et al. (1990) and Boehncke et al. (1994), among others, have drawn attention to a number of facts in conflict with this being the only, or even the major, pathway. Searching for possible alternative, or additional, mechanisms of dGuo toxicity, Duan et al. (1990) compared its

effects on a double-mutant of a mouse T-lymphoma S-49 cell line (deficient in PNP and partially resistant to dGTP feedback inhibition of ribonucleoside reductase) with those on wild-type cells and an NSU-1 mutant with only PNP deficiency. Results indicated that inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by dGTP/dGuo is not necessarily the primary toxic mechanism in S-49 cells, but may be only an accessory event that maintains the cells in the sensitive G1 phase of the cell cycle, where other mechanisms of dGTP/dGuo toxicity may be operative, for example, inhibition of RNA synthesis, observed at an early stage in the double-mutant cell line. In a study on the potential use of PNP inhibitors for therapy of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, Boehncke et al. (1994) examined the effects of two 9-deazaGuo analogue inhibitors on a T-cell line from a patient with mycosis fungoides. In contrast to normal lymphoblasts, the effects of these inhibitors on proliferation of the transformed cells were not enhanced on addition of dGuo. Flow cytometric analysis showed that both inhibitors led to a block in the S-phase of the cell cycle, partially reversible by addition of the interleukin IL-2, in line with reduced effects of the inhibitors on an IL-2-dependent cell line. Whereas the block in the S-phase produced by the PNP inhibitors did indeed point to inhibition of a putative enzyme involved in DNA synthesis, this enzyme was considered unlikely to be ribonucleotide reductase, since the effect of the inhibitors was not augmented by addition of dGuo, the phosphorylation of which would lead to dGTP and inhibition of the reductase. 9-(3-Pyridinylmethyl)-9-deazaGua (BCX-34, Peldesine), the PNP inhibitor undergoing clinical trials, has been shown to inhibit proliferation of human T-cells by both dGuodependent and dGuo-independent mechanisms, whereas its activity versus T-lymphoblastic leukemia CCRF-CEM cells appears to be uniquely dGuo-dependent (Bantia et al., 1996; Conry et al., 1998). Snyder et al. (1994, 1997) have examined this problem with an in vivo murine model, based on earlier observations that PNP-deficient mice excrete PNP nucleoside substrates in proportion to the severity of enzyme deficiency. Whereas PNP-deficient human erythrocytes and thymocytes exhibit an increase in dGTP levels, only minimal accumulation of dGTP was noted in thymocytes of the more severely PNP-deficient mice, due to an observed secondary reduction in dGuo kinase activity accompanying PNP deficiency. Although dGTP is considered to regulate the level of dCTP via inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, no reduction in the dCTP pool was observed in the PNP-deficient mice. Perturbations in T-cell maturation were noted, but it remains to be determined what is the link between this, the thymocyte dGTP level, and PNP deficiency (Snyder et al., 1997). Particularly interesting are the findings of Snyder et al. (1994) on the levels of nucleotide pools in erythrocytes and liver of mutant mice, leading to the conclusion that PNP

deficiency is associated with a secondary reduction in dGuo kinase activity, distinct from Ado kinase and two peaks of putative dCyd kinase activities, all fractionated by anion exchange chromatography. The existence of two well-separated peaks of putative dCyd kinase activity is at first sight puzzling. However, one of these could well have been mitochondrial thymidine kinase (TK2), for which dCyd is a good substrate (Munch-Petersen et al., 1991). This could have been resolved by testing whether one of the peaks phosphorylates thymidine. If both peaks were indeed dCyd kinases, each should also phosphorylate dAdo and dGuo, which are not substrates for TK2. Furthermore, the dGuo kinase peak should also phosphorylate dAdo and dIno. It is of interest, in this context, that an isoform of mitochondrial dGuo kinase, incapable of translocating into the mitochondria, and, hence, probably a cytoplasmic enzyme, has been isolated from mouse spleen. Its specificity and specific activity are similar to those of the human mitochondrial enzyme (Petrakis et al., 1999). It perhaps is not out of place to note that the origin of mitochondrial nucleoside kinases in erythrocytes must be the precursor(s) of these cells. The results of the foregoing study underline the importance of more detailed analyses of nucleoside kinases, as well as the hitherto overlooked nucleoside phosphotransferase activities (see Shugar, 1992), in normal and PNP-deficient human and mouse cells. It is worth noting that Carson et al. (1977) long ago drew attention to the possible role of nucleoside kinases in association with lymphospecific toxicity in ADA and PNP deficiency. Arpaia et al. (2000), in a study on PNP-deficient mice, postulated a mitochondrial involvement in PNP deficiency. It was proposed that the accompanying abnormalities are due to selective accumulation of dGTP in the mitochondria of T-cells, leading to defective mitochondrial DNA repair, resulting in enhanced sensitivity of T-cells to spontaneous mitochondrial DNA damage. The end result is T-cell depletion by apoptosis. The authors assumed that dGuo kinase is localized exclusively in the mitochondria. However, it should be noted that Petrakis et al. (1999) recently found an isoform of mitochondrial dGuo kinase in the cytoplasm of mouse spleen cells. 3. Properties of purine nucleoside phosphorylase from different sources 3.1. Classification PNPs with differing specificities have been identified, and, in a number of instances, purified from a broad range of organisms. The majority, including the four hitherto obtained in crystalline form, may be tentatively assigned, on the basis of various criteria (Fig. 3), to two main categories, as follows: (1) Low-molecular-mass (low-mm) homotrimers, with Mr $ 80 ±100 kDa, specific for catalysis of 6-oxopurines

and their nucleosides, often referred to as ``Ino ± Guo phosphorylases,'' and listed in the SWISS-PROT Data Bank as ``PNP/5H-deoxy-5H-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) family 2 phosphorylases'' (see Section 3.2). Enzymes of this type have been isolated from many mammalian tissues (Parks & Agarwal, 1972; Stoeckler, 1984), and from some microorganisms, for example, PNPI from Bacillus stearothermophilus TH6-2 (Hamamoto et al., 1996, 1997a) (see Table 2). (2) High-molecular-mass (high-mm) homohexamers, with Mr $ 110 ±160 kDa, with broader specificity in that they accept as substrates both 6-oxo- and/or 6-aminopurines and their nucleosides, and are found in microorganisms. For some of these, Ado is a much better substrate than Ino and Guo, e.g., Bacillus subtilis so-called ``Ado-PNP'' (Jensen, 1978), occasionally referred to as ``Ado phosphorylases'' or, in the SWISS-PROT Data Bank, as ``PNP/UDP family 1 phosphorylases'' (see Section 3.2). This class includes the enzymes from E. coli (deoD gene product), Salmonella typhimurium (Robertson & Hoffee, 1973; Jensen & Nygaard, 1975), Klebsiella (Takehara et al., 1995), and Sulfolobus solfataricus (Cacciapuoti et al., 1994). The above classification, which should be considered tentative, is based in part on the properties of the four enzymes for which the structures in the crystalline state have been established (Section 4), with the implicit assumption that the same structure and subunit composition exist in solution. This subject has recently been reviewed for other oligomeric and multimeric proteins (Jaenicke & Lilie, 2000). In fact, there are a number of reported departures from the two proposed classes of PNPs as regards molecular mass and subunit composition, as well as specificity (Fig. 3), some of which we now enumerate. Ino ±Guo phosphorylases, highly purified from vegetative cells and spores of B. cereus, both considered to be coded for by the same gene, exhibit the specificity of lowmm PNPs (Gardner & Kornberg, 1967). Both have a subunit Mr of 24 kDa by gel electrophoresis. However, by sucrose density gradient sedimentation and sedimentation equilibrium, the cellular enzyme appears to be a tetramer, whereas the spore enzyme exhibits a phosphate-dependent equilibrium between a dimer and a tetramer (Engelbrecht & Sadoff, 1969; Gilpin & Sadoff, 1971). One of the two PNPs encoded by the genome of B. stearothermophilus strain JTS 859 (Hori et al., 1989a) exhibits a specificity and subunit mass similar to Ino ±Guo phosphorylases, but the molecular mass from gel filtration pointed to its being a dimer. PNPII from the same organism, with the specificity of high-mm enzymes, appears to be a tetramer (Hori et al., 1989b; see Table 2). Particularly interesting is the hexameric (Mr $ 150 ± 180 kDa) so-called Xao phosphorylase (E. coli PNPII, a product of the xapA gene) induced in E. coli cultivated in the presence of Xao (Hammer-Jespersen et al., 1980; Bezirjian et al., 1986; Koszalka et al., 1988; see Seeger et al., 1995). It differs from other high-mm enzymes by its inability to

See text for further details, particularly as regards lack of reliable quantitative data on subunit composition in solution and possible equilibria between different oligomeric states.

accept Ado as a substrate, whereas the 6-oxopurine nucleoside Xao is an excellent substrate (see Table 2). The enzyme is reversibly inactivated by the ± SH reagent pchloromercuribenzoate, which irreversibly dissociates the PNPII into inactive monomers (Koszalka et al., 1988). Even more striking is the trimeric PNPII* isolated from xapR mutants, which are altered in the regulation of xanthosine phosphorylase (Buxton et al., 1980; Bezirjian et al., 1986; Jùrgensen & Dandanell, 1999). It still accepts Xao, but, unlike other low-mm enzymes, it also accepts Ado and dAdo as good substrates. Confirmation of this finding obviously is called for, the more so in that in their original description of Xao phosphorylase, Hammer-Jespersen et al. (1980) reported that gel filtration of the enzyme gave two

peaks, one with Mr $ 200 kDa (which would correspond to a hexamer) and another with Mr $ 100 kDa (hence, a trimer), both with activity versus Xao, Ino, and Guo; apparently Ado was not tested. A number of reports describe PNPs from mammalian sources with subunit compositions other than trimers (Murakami & Tsushima, 1975; Lewis & Glantz, 1976a, 1976b; Lewis, 1978; Haag & Lewis, 1994). A dimer composition, based on sedimentation equilibrium and gel filtration, was even proposed for human erythrocyte PNP (Lewis & Lowy, 1979), but has been considered obsolete since establishment of the trimeric structure in the crystal (Ealick et al., 1990b). The monomeric form of calf spleen PNP was claimed by Ropp and Traut (1991a) to exhibit high activity,

Assignments to low-mm or high-mm classes are based on specificity, molecular mass, and subunit composition, and to SWISS-PROT Data Bank ``family 1 PNP/UDP'' or ``family 2 PNP/MTAP,'' based on amino acid sequences. Most mammalian PNPs are not included, and have been reviewed earlier (Stoeckler, 1984). a Designations PNPI, PNPII, PNPII*, Ado phosphorylase, Ino ± Guo phosphorylase, etc. are according to original authors. b Values in parentheses are calculated from the amino acid sequences. c Assignment according to authors. d Hammer-Jespersen et al. (1980) reported the detection, by gel filtration, of an enzymatically active trimer. e From sequence identified in genome; other data are for the partially purified enzyme.

a result not confirmed by others (Miles et al., 1998; A. Â Bzowska, unpublished; A. Modrak-Wojcik, unpublished), and in apparent contradiction to the active site architecture (see Section 4.4). Nonetheless, existence of the calf spleen enzyme in active monomeric and trimeric forms was assumed to build a model to interpret qualitative and semiquantitative features of calf spleen PNP-catalyzed hydrolysis of the 6-thio analogue of m7Guo (MESG) (Cheng et al., 1999). However, it should be strongly emphasized that gel filtration and electrophoresis are by no means ideal methods for determination of subunit composition; for example, it is difficult to distinguish between a pentamer and a hexamer with experimental data of 125 kDa for Mr and a subunit mass of 24 or 25 kDa. In this regard, our own findings with the enzyme from Cellulomonas are instructive. Gel filtration led to an Mr of 114 kDa. A subunit mass of 29 kDa was determined by both mass spectrometry and amino acid sequence, pointing to a tetrameric structure. Together with the finding that Ado is not a substrate, but is a competitive inhibitor, with Ki = 160 mM, it appeared that the enzyme is not a member of the two main classes (Tebbe et al., 1997; Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998). Subsequently, X-ray crystallography and crystal density measurements (Bzowska et al., 1998b; Tebbe et al., 1999) revealed that, at least in the crystal, it is a trimer and a member of the low-mm class. It is perhaps of interest that the PNP of Proteus vulgaris exhibits an Mr by gel filtration of 120 kDa, close to that of Cellulomonas, as well as similar specificity in that Ado is not a substrate, but is an even more effective competitive inhibitor, with Ki = 50 mM (Table 2).

There is obviously a compelling need for more accurate, and unambiguous, measurements of molecular masses and subunit compositions of PNPs in solution. Values of Mr determined by gel filtration are dependent not only on the shape and charge of the molecule, but also on possible interaction with the matrix. The recent rebirth and revolution in analytical ultracentrifugation techniques (Hansen et al., 1994; Schuster & Toedt, 1996), further stimulated by the introduction on the market of modernized ultracentrifuges with highly computerized systems, now makes possible measurements of differences in sedimentation velocities of the order of 1%, and is the best tool presently available for following association ±dissociation processes of macromolecules in solution. It would be informative, for example, to reexamine the reported phosphate-dependent dimer± tetramer equilibrium for the highly purified B. subtilis spore PNP (Gilpin & Sadoff, 1971) referred to above. We are aware of only one published report on the use of modern analytical ultracentrifugation techniques to determine the oligomeric state of a PNP (Nixon et al., 1998). For a partially purified ``bacterial'' PNP, which is probably the enzyme from Cellulomonas (see Table 2), only a single component was observed, with an Mr of 85 kDa, consistent with the trimeric state of Cellulomonas PNP in the crystal (see above). In contrast, a recombinant form of E. coli PNP, at a very low concentration, exhibited an equilibrium of oligomeric species, but attempts to fit the data to various oligomeric states were ambiguous. The authors apparently were unaware of the fact that the structure of the hexameric E. coli PNP in the crystal had been established as a trimer of dimers (Mao et al., 1997;

360

A. Bzowska et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 88 (2000) 349±425

Koellner et al., 1998), and it undoubtedly would have been profitable to examine a possible equilibrium between dimers and hexamers. For the enzymes from E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium, no monomer activity was found (Jensen & Nygaard, 1975), in accordance with the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme (Sections 4.2 and 4.5). The existence in solution of a given PNP with an equilibrium mixture of species with different subunit composition could account, at least in part, for the complex kinetics observed. Therefore, it would be highly instructive to examine the kinetics for a PNP with the same structure and subunit composition in the solid state and in solution. Such a candidate exists, viz. the highly thermostable MTAP/ PNP from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (Cacciapuoti et al., 1994, 1996), a homohexamer, comprising a dimer of trimers, with the subunits linked via six disulfide bonds, thermostable at 130°C and resistant to a number of denaturants and proteolytic enzymes. Once again, we should like to emphasize that the foregoing be kept in mind in what follows, at least until more reliable data are forthcoming on the oligomeric states of PNPs in solution. 3.2. Amino acid sequences The SWISS-PROT database for June 2000 reports 19 complete and two partial sequences of PNPs from various sources (search performed with the key word ``purine nucleoside phosphorylase''). All of them show homology to calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNP (8 enzymes) or to E. coli PNP (11 enzymes). In one case of a human gastric pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, two entries are present in the SWISS-PROT database, which compares the genomic sequences of two unrelated isolates (Alm et al., 1999). SWISS-PROT also provides sequences of two additional enzymes referred to as xanthosine phosphorylase from E. coli K12 (Seeger et al., 1995) and MTAP from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Cacciapuoti, 1995). On the basis of sequence homology, they may be classified as belonging to low- and high-mm classes of PNPs, respectively (see Figs. 4 and 5), and as discussed in the previous section and below (see also Table 2), the names are misleading and, rather, both should be designated as PNPs. By searching for amino acid sequences with homology to PNPs of low- or high-mm (Altschul et al., 1997), other putative PNPs have been identified, e.g., in the total genome of Caenorhabditis elegans (Wilson et al., 1994). Two further sequences (from Cellulomonas and rat), not yet in SWISS-PROT, but available in the literature, are also included (Erion et al., 1997a; Tebbe et al., 1999). Finally, by searching for proteins with a domain structure similar to PNPs (SWISS-PROT PRODOM option), additional proteins have been identified as belonging to the same families. A list of all of these sequences is presented

in Figs. 4 and 5, which display low- and high-mm class phosphorylases, respectively, as well as others showing homology or sharing a similar domain structure. However, most of these sequences, and also some denoted as PNPs, are putative proteins identified from amino acid sequence analysis, and not yet isolated and characterized (see Table 2 for those isolated). It should be noted that the genomes of three organisms, E. coli, Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis, encode genes for two distinct PNPs, ascribed on the basis of sequence homology to the high- and low-mm classes (see Figs. 4 and 5). Almost no sequence homology is observed between the two classes, although they catalyze virtually the same chemical reactions. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the low-mm class includes enzymes classified as MTAP, whereas the high-mm class includes enzymes with UP activity. This is why the low- and high-mm classes are listed in the SWISS-PROT data bank as ``PNP/MTAP family 2 phosphorylases'' and ``PNP/UDP family 1 phosphorylases,'' respectively. All enzymes belonging to each family share at least one domain (SWISS-PROT PRODOM option). Active site amino acids (see also Section 4) identified for families 2 and 1 on the basis of the three-dimensional structures of calf spleen, human erythrocyte, and E. coli PNPs, respectively, are shown in white on a black background (Figs. 4 and 5). It is clear that almost all are conserved for PNPs from each family, and many of them are conserved in all nucleoside phosphorylases, that is, for PNPs and MTAPs in the case of family 2 and for PNPs and UPs in the case of family 1. The role of active site amino acids is discussed in Section 4. It may be concluded that the general classification of PNPs, based on specificity, molecular mass, and subunit composition, is in agreement with the classification based on amino acid sequences, and where experimental data are available, low-mm enzymes may be identified as ``PNP/ MTAP family 2 phosphorylases'' and high-mm enzymes as ``PNP/UP family 1 phosphorylases.'' Moreover, it shows that the sequence may help in classification of PNPs that, on the basis of specificity, Mr, and subunit composition, rather would be included in the class ``Others'' (see Fig. 3). Perhaps the most striking example is the enzyme from the extremely thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, with optimal growth at 87°C. The enzyme, purified to homogeneity, has an Mr of 160 kDa, and is composed of six identical subunits of 27 kDa. Although referred to as a 5Hdeoxy-5H-methylthioAdo (MTA) phosphorylase, it was found to cleave Ino, Guo, and Ado with better efficiency than MTA, and, therefore, may more appropriately be considered a PNP. The enzyme has been cloned and sequenced (Cacciapuoti et al., 1996). Whereas it shows low similarity to the specific human MTA phosphorylase (16% identity, 27% similarity), there is a much better similarity to E. coli PNP (32% identity, 49% similarity) and E. coli UP (30% identity, 45% similarity) and conserva-

Fig. 4. Comparison of amino acid sequences of nucleoside phosphorylases from different sources with sequence homology to E. coli PNP. This group consists of 11 PNPs from microorganisms; 1 MTAP from Sulfolobus solfataricus, which, however, is more active versus Ino, Guo, and Ado than versus MTA (Cacciapuoti et al., 1994); and 8 UPs, 6 from microorganisms and the last 2 from human and mouse. In the SWISS-PROT Data Bank, this family is called the PNP/UDP family 1 phosphorylases (which we refer to as PNP/UP, since UDP is the IUPAB abbreviation for uridine-5H-diphosphate), in contrast to the PNP/MTAP family 2 phosphorylases that include PNPs homologous to calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs. Note that most of these are putative (hypothetical) proteins, identified only from sequence data (see also Table 2). Note also that in Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus stearothermophilus, in addition to PNP homologous with E. coli PNP, as shown, a second PNP has been identified and classified as a member of family 2 (see Table 6 and Fig. 5). Amino acids constituting the binding site in E. coli PNP are shown in white on a black background according to Koellner et al. (1998) and Mao et al. (1997). Their conservation in other nucleoside phosphorylases belonging to this family is marked in the same way. PNP sequences are from the following sources: E. coli (Hershfield et al., 1991), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Vezina et al., 1998), Haemophilus influenzae (Fleischmann et al., 1995), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Takehara et al., 1995), Lactococcus lactis (Duwat et al., 1997), Treponema pallidum (Fraser et al., 1998), Bacillus subtilis (Kunst et al., 1997), Bacillus stearothermophilus (Hamamoto et al., 1997a), Helicobacter pylori (Tomb et al., 1997), Mycoplasma genitalium (Fraser et al., 1995), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Himmelreich et al., 1996). The MTAP sequence is from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Cacciapuoti, 1995); sequences of UPs are from E. coli (Walton et al., 1989), Klebsiella aerogenes and Salmonella typhimurium (Veiko et al., 1998), Haemophilus influenzae (Fleischmann et al., 1995), Treponema pallidum (Fraser et al., 1998), human (Watanabe & Uchida, 1995), and mouse (Watanabe et al., 1995). Note: in E. coli PNP, Tyr160 has no direct contact with the purine base, but was described as an active site amino acid because, together with Phe159, it is involved in p ± p interactions with the base (Koellner et al., 1998). Phel67 is listed here as an active site residue (Mao et al., 1997), but see Table 7. Redetermination of the Helicobacter pylori sequence (Alm et al., 1999) led to seven changes in the sequence shown in the figure, none active-site residues.

tion of the active site amino acids resembling the former (see Fig. 4). 3.3. Physico-chemical properties The subunit organization of PNPs from various sources, which constitutes the basis for tentative classification of

PNPs as low-mm homotrimers and high-mm homohexamers, is described in Sections 3.1 and 4. All PNPs, with very few exceptions, show broad pH activity optima between pH 7 and 8, or even 6 and 8.5, depending on the enzyme source (e.g., Kim et al., 1968; Jensen & Nygaard, 1975; Lewis & Glantz, 1976a, 1976b; Moyer & Fisher, 1976; Wielgus-Kutrowska, 1999). The

362

most striking exceptions are PNPI and PNPII from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Hori et al., 1989a, 1989b), with activity optima between neutral pH and pH 11, as well as PNP from Brevibacterium acetylicum, with an optimum at pH 8.5 (Shirae & Yokozeki, 1991a). In other cases, pH optima are more acidic, for example, pH 6 for xanthosine phosphorylase from E. coli (Hammer-Jespersen et al., 1980) and PNP from chicken liver (Murakami et al., 1971). Activity optima for E. coli and calf spleen PNPs correspond to the pH-dependent stability profiles of these enzymes (Krenitsky et al., 1981). An exception is PNP from Cellulomonas, which, with an optimum between pH 6 and 8.5, is stable for 1 hr at pH 11 (Wielgus-Kutrowska, 1999). Typically, high-mm PNPs are more thermostable than their low-mm counterparts, e.g., PNP from E. coli is stable

for 10 min at 55°C (Krenitsky et al., 1981) and that from Klebsiella for 16 hr at 60°C (Ling et al., 1994). An extreme case is PNP from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Cacciapuoti et al., 1994), which retains full activity after 2 hr at 100°C, ascribed to the presence of 6 disulfide bonds positioned between subunits (Cacciapuoti et al., 1999). Thermostable PNPs include PNPI and PNPII from Bacillus stearothermophilus (Hori et al., 1989a, 1989b). By contrast, mammalian lowmm PNPs are much more temperature-sensitive, for example, calf spleen PNP slightly loses activity even after 10 min at > 35°C (Krenitsky et al., 1981). However, some low-mm PNPs, such as from Cellulomonas (Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998), resemble high-mm ones in thermostability. Other properties, such as isoelectric points, sedimentation coefficients, and Stokes radii, mainly for low-mm

(Continued on next page) Fig. 5. Comparison of amino acid sequences of nucleoside phosphorylases from different sources showing sequence homology with calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs. This group consists of 12 PNPs, 1 so-called xanthosine phosphorylase from E. coli, 6 MTAPs, and 6 putative (hypothetical) proteins. In the SWISS-PROT Data Bank, this group is called the PNP/MTAP family 2 phosphorylases, in contrast to the PNP/UP family 1 phosphorylases that include PNPs with homology to E. coli PNP. Most are putative phosphorylases identified by sequence analysis only. Amino acids that constitute the binding site in calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs are shown in white on black background according to Mao et al. (1997, 1998), Montgomery et al. (1993), and Narayana et al. (1997). Their conservation in other nucleoside phosphorylases belonging to this family are marked in the same way. Sequences of genes and/ or proteins in this family are from the following sources: calf spleen (Bzowska et al., 1995a), human (Williams et al., 1984), mouse (Jenuth & Snyder, 1991), rat (Erion et al., 1997a), Cellulomonas (Tebbe et al., 1999), Bacillus subtilis (Schuch et al., 1995), Bacillus stearothermophilus (Hamamoto et al., 1997b), yeast (Johnston et al., 1994), Caenorhabditis elegans (Wilson et al., 1994), Mycobacterium leprae (Smith & Robinson, 1994), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Philipp et al., 1996), Aquifex aeolicus (Deckert et al., 1998), xanthosine phosphorylase from E. coli (Seeger et al., 1995), MTAPs from Caenorhabditis elegans (Wilson et al., 1994), human (Olopade et al., 1995), Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (Smith et al., 1997), Pyrococcus horikoshii, two proteins with 260 and 265 residues (Kawarabayasi et al., 1998), Archaeoglobus fulgidus (Klenk et al., 1997), and putative proteins from Methanococcus jannaschii (Bult et al., 1996), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Philipp et al., 1996), Synechocystis sp. (Kaneko et al., 1996), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Badcock et al., 1995), and yeast (Saville et al., 1995). See also Table 6.

PNPs, have been reported (e.g., Gilpin & Sadoff, 1971; Stoeckler et al., 1978b; Schimandle et al., 1985; McElwain et al., 1988; Hori et al., 1989a; Shirae & Yokozeki, 1991a; Stoeckler et al., 1978b) and reviewed (Parks & Agarwal, 1972; Stoeckler, 1984). Isoelectric points are in the pH range from 4.2 (PNP from human mitochondria; Haag & Lewis, 1994) to 6.8 (PNP from Plasmodium lophurae; Schimandle et al., 1985). Data regarding isoelectric points are of importance in relation to the complex kinetic behaviour of PNPs (see Section 3.4). Human PNP from erythrocytes, placenta, brain, leukemic granulocytes, and fibroblasts, as well as from some other mammals (e.g., from rat), show electrophoretic heterogeneity resulting from post-translational modifications (Agarwal et al., 1975; Stoeckler, 1984). PNP from human erythrocytes migrates in at least 7 bands, with pI values between 5.0 and 6.4, and there is a correlation between in vivo aging of erythrocytes and progressive loss of alkaline, and appearance of acidic, variants (Edwards et al., 1971; Turner et al., 1971; Agarwal et al., 1975; Stoeckler, 1984). These seven variants were fully separated, and only five of them showed complex kinetic behaviour (Accorsi et al., 1991). It follows that non-Michaelis kinetics observed for human erythrocyte PNP are not due to a mixture of enzyme variants with different kinetic properties.

In contrast, calf spleen PNP shows no electrophoretic heterogeneity (Agarwal et al., 1975). It was suggested that a mixture of isoelectric variants of human erythrocyte PNP is the cause of the low resolution in diffraction from crystals, but this appears implausible, since a similar low resolution is observed for crystals of the isoelectrically homogenous recombinant enzyme (Ealick et al., 1990). Circular dichroism spectra of low-mm PNPs indicate $ 65% random coil, and a very low a-helix, structure (Stoeckler et al., 1978b), in striking contrast to the secondary structure composition obtained from X-ray studies (see Section 4). Absorption in the UV for low- and high-mm PNPs is typical for most proteins, with absorption maxima at 278± 280 nm. However, enzymes differ markedly in the value of extinction coefficients, since some PNPs (e.g., the E. coli enzyme) do not contain tryptophan residues (Hershfield et al., 1991). Extinction coefficients for human erythrocyte and calf spleen PNPs are e1cm1% = 9.6 (Stoeckler et al., 1978a) and for E. coli and Cellulomonas PNPs, e1cm1% = 2.7 and 5.9 (Tebbe et al., 1997; Bzowska et al., 1998b; WielgusKutrowska, 1999). Fluorescence emission spectra of E. coli and calf spleen enzymes show maxima at 304 and 340 nm, respectively (Porter, 1992; Kierdaszuk et al., 1997), in agreement with the fact that the former contains only tyrosine, and the latter both tyrosine and tryptophan (Hershfield et al., 1991; Bzowska et al., 1995a). These emission

364

A. Bzowska et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 88 (2000) 349±425

spectra have been profited from to study interactions of the enzymes with substrates and inhibitors in solution (e.g., Porter, 1992; Kierdaszuk et al., 1997, 2000; WielgusKutrowska et al., 1999). 3.4. Specificity and kinetic properties 3.4.1. Natural substrates, analogues, substrate/inhibitor discrimination The natural substrates of low-mm PNPs are 6-oxopurines (Gua, Hx; but, see below) and their ribosides and 2Hdeoxyribosides, whereas the high-mm enzymes additionally accept 6-aminopurine (adenine) and its nucleosides. With the low-mm enzymes, rates of phosphorolysis and/or synthesis of Ado, if detectable, are well below 1% the rate for Ino (Zimmerman et al., 1971; Stoeckler et al., 1997; see Table 3). However, some are competitively inhibited by, and, hence, bind, Ado or/and Ade, for example, the PNPs from Sarcoma 180 cells (Zimmerman et al., 1971), Proteus vulgaris (Surette et al., 1990), and Cellulomonas (WielgusKutrowska et al., 1998). With the latter, phosphorolysis of Ado is not detectable (Wielgus-Kutrowska, 1999), but Ade was reported earlier to be a substrate (Hennen & Wong, 1989). Several enzymes exhibit stricter specificity, limited largely or exclusively to 6-aminopurines and their nucleosides, and are referred to as adenine nucleoside phosphorylases or Ado phosphorylases (Table 2), not to be confused with MTA phosphorylases (see Section 3.2). In E. coli cells cultivated in the presence of xanthosine, the latter induces appearance of an enzyme, named originally xanthosine phosphorylase (see Section 3.1), a homohexamer with the specificity and sequence of low-mm PNPs, but additionally accepting xanthosine as substrate (see Table 2). In this context, it is highly relevant that, with a pKa $ 5.7 (Roy & Miles, 1983; Shugar & Psoda, 1990), Xao is a monoanion at physiological pH, resulting from dissociation of the N(3)± H. The monoanion is still a 6-oxopurine nucleoside, but its mode of binding probably differs from that of the neutral nucleoside. Examination of its substrate activity as a function of pH is clearly called for. Although it was long considered that, like pyrimidines, pyridines are not substrates for PNPs (Parks & Agarwal, 1972), it has since been demonstrated convincingly that the naturally occurring positively charged nicotinamide riboside (NR + ) is indeed a moderately good substrate of the enzymes from calf spleen and E. coli (Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1997; see Section 3.4.2). Moreover, its substrate properties with the calf spleen enzyme are consistent with a newly proposed mechanism of catalysis (see Section 5). Whether phosphorolysis of NR + is of physiological significance is not known. Stoeckler (1984) describes the specificity of low-mm mammalian PNPs versus a variety of nucleoside analogues with structural variations in the aglycone and/or pentose moieties. Early reports on specificities of high-mm

enzymes include those from E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium (Jensen & Nygaard, 1975; Jensen, 1976), and the Ï Â comprehensive study of Doskocil and Holy (1977) on the enzyme from E. coli. Subsequently, comparison of the enzymes from E. coli and mammalian sources (calf and human) revealed the existence of nucleoside analogues that are selective substrates only for E. coli PNP (see Fig. 6). These include 1methylinosine; 1-methylguanosine (Bzowska et al., 1988); the neutral form of 1-methyladenosine, which is the fixed imino tautomer (Bzowska et al., 1992), purine riboside, benzimidazole riboside, and others (Bzowska et al., 1990; Bzowska & Kazimierczuk, 1995), the selectivities of which are readily interpretable from crystal structure data (see Section 4). Several analogues that are substrates for the E. coli, but not the mammalian, enzyme, for example, 6methylpurine-2H-deoxyriboside (MePdR), are of special interest because their aglycones, but not the parent nucleosides, are highly cytotoxic, and are considered good candidates for tumour-directed gene therapy (Secrist et al., 1999; see Section 7.4). Substrates discriminating between low-mm and high-mm PNPs lack either a 6-keto substituent, nitrogen N(1) or proton at this position, or have a halogen (chlorine or fluorine) at position C(2) of the base. It is particularly relevant to the mechanism of catalysis (see Section 5) that, in contrast to the E. coli enzyme, the requirements for activity towards low-mm PNPs are a 6-oxo substituent or one with similar electronic properties, S or Se (Stoeckler, 1984), and a proton at N(1). Only substituents that may donate a hydrogen to glutamic acid (Glu201 in mammalian and Glu204 in Cellulomonas PNPs), for example, NH2 or NHCH3, are tolerated at C(2). Insofar as the pentose moiety is concerned, steric alterations of the hydroxyls at C(2H) and/or C(3H) decrease or abolish substrate activity versus human erythrocyte PNP. On the other hand, there is considerable tolerance at the 5Hposition, as regards the orientation of the 5H-CH2OH or its absence or replacement by a halogeno group (Stoeckler et al., 1980; see Stoeckler, 1984). The human enzyme also binds analogues with the pentose ring replaced by other cyclic (arylmethyl, cycloaliphaticmethyl, saturated heterocyclicmethyl) or acyclic moieties (Montgomery, 1993; Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1984; see Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.3). In contrast, the high-mm E. coli enzyme is inactive towards analogues of Ado with sterically modified pentoses, with the possible exception of the a-L-lyxofuranosyl analogue, with a different orientation of the 5HÏ Â CH2OH (Doskocil & Holy, 1977). In contrast to the human enzyme, that from E. coli does not tolerate replacement of the pentose ring by a benzyl moiety, for example, a series of 9-deaza-9-halogenobenzyl adenines, the corresponding guanine congeners of which (made available by Dr. J. Montgomery [BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Birmingham, AL, USA]) are highly potent inhibitors of human PNP (see Section 6.1.3), are only feeble

inhibitors of the bacterial enzyme (E. Kulikowska, A. Bzowska, and D. Shugar, unpublished). Similarly, a series of acyclonucleoside inhibitors of mammalian PNPs, with one exception, did not inhibit the E. coli enzyme (Bzowska et al., 1990). It follows, from the foregoing, that low-mm PNPs exhibit a stricter specificity for the base moiety, and a lower one for the pentose (or a quasi-pentose) moiety than the high-mm E. coli PNP (cf. Sections 4 and 5). 3.4.2. Unusual substrates Some nucleoside analogues, such as m7Guo, MESG, NR + , 7-(b-D-ribofuranosyl)Gua, and others (see Table 4), are substrates of PNPs from various sources, and undergo nonreversible phosphorolysis, or have a Keq so small that

the reaction is essentially irreversible, for example, for MESG as substrate for low-mm PNP, Keq = 0.008 (Kulikowska et al., 1986; Bzowska et al., 1988, 1990, 1994, 1996; Webb, 1992; Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1997). Others are resistant to phosphorolysis, but their bases may be substrates in the reverse, synthetic, pathway, for example, allopurinol, 8-azapurines (Stoeckler, 1984; Wierzchowski et al., 1996; Erion et al., 1997a) (see Table 4). Although Ado is an extremely weak substrate, if at all, of low-mm PNPs, m7Ado and 3-b-Ado are substrates, the latter with a Vmax almost twice that for Ino with the calf spleen enzyme. N(7) methyl analogues of Ino and Guo are excellent substrates, as are other 7-alkylguanosines, such as, ethyl, propyl, butyl, benzyl, not included in Table 4 (Bzowska et al., 1988).

Reactions are nonreversible, with one exception. Where available, data for the corresponding natural substrate are included (in parentheses) for comparison; nd, not determined. a Product of Sigma, source not given, but presumably Cellulomonas (TOYOBA). b The purine base (but not the nucleoside) is a substrate (for the reverse, synthetic, reaction).

tion of the purine ring N(1)± H of $ 6.4 ±7.1 (see Table 4), all 7-substituted nucleosides at neutral pH are a mixture of cationic and zwitterionic forms (shown in Table 4 for m7Guo, m7Ino, and MESG). For the calf spleen and human erythrocyte enzymes, the cationic form of m7Guo is the preferred substrate (Kulikowska et al., 1986; Bzowska et al., 1990). As shown in Table 4, both low-mm and high-mm PNPs are able to cleave the glycosidic bond of purine nucleosides, with the pentosyl moiety attached not only at position N(9), but also at N(3) or N(7). The latter finding led to synthesis of an N(7)-acycloguanosine inhibitor with a different mode of binding of the purine base in the active site of the calf spleen enzyme (Bzowska et al., 1995a; see Section 4.4.3). It was noted long ago by Streeter et al. (1980) that crude extracts of E. coli, but not mammalian, cells contain an activity that cleaves the antibacterial nucleoside analogue N(7)-ribosyl-3-deazaGua to liberate 3-deazaGua, the active antibacterial agent. The activity was identified as a PNP. Extracts of mammalian cells were found inactive versus N(7)-ribosylGua, probably due to

their low specific activities, and E. coli extracts were inactive versus 3-deazaGuo, probably for the same reason, since it subsequently was shown that 3-deazaIno is a substrate for purified enzymes from both E. coli and calf spleen (Bzowska et al., 1990), and 3-deazaGuo for purified human erythrocyte PNP (Stoeckler, 1984). Relevant to the foregoing is the natural occurrence, albeit uncommon, of purine N(7)-ribosides, associated with vitamin B12 complexes (see Bzowska et al., 1994). 3.4.3. Reactions catalyzed Reversible phosphorolysis catalyzed by PNP becomes nonreversible on replacement of Pi by arsenate. Arsenolysis leads to formation of the chemically highly unstable ribose1-arsenate, thus precluding the reverse reaction. The nonreversibility of arsenolysis has been profited from in a number of instances, for example, by Schramm and coworkers (Kline & Schramm, 1993) in studies on the reaction mechanism, leading to development of TS analogue inhibitors (Schramm, 1999; see Sections 5 and 6.2). PNP has been reported to catalyze the transfer of the pentose ring between purine bases according to the reaction

Although such a procedure is not correct for non-linear Scatchard plots, straight lines were fitted to the linear portions of the plot to obtain apparent kinetic constants (Km = 19 and 330 mM, and Vmax = 48 and 107 U/ mg) comparable with those published for PNPs from other sources (from Wielgus-Kutrowska, 1999).

(c) Kinetic properties for orthophosphate with Cellulomonas PNP shown as a direct plot of vo vs. co. Experimental data as in (a) and (b). Two models were fitted to the data: the Michaelis ± Menten equation and an equation assuming two binding sites, each with Michaelis ± Menten kinetics, vo(co)=((Vmax1co)/ (co + Km1))+((Vmax2co)/(co + Km2)), characterized by a pair of kinetic constants Km and Vmax. A residual plot comparing the two models is shown as an insert. Constants obtained from the two-site model are shown in Table 3A.

Ï (e.g., Abrams et al., 1965; Parks & Agarwal, 1972; Doskocil Â & Holy, 1977): purine1  purine2 nucleoside 6 purine2  purine1 nucleoside Some reports have claimed that this reaction proceeds in the absence of phosphate, but, to date, there is no unequivocal evidence in support of this, and the reaction may be an overall result of both phosphorolysis and synthesis, directed in part by the relative affinities for the enzyme of the two purine bases. In the absence of Pi, calf spleen PNP catalyzes a very slow hydrolysis of Guo, MESG, and Ino (Kline & Schramm, 1992; Cheng et al., 1999). With Ino and MESG, a tight-binding complex of the enzyme with the purine base is formed (see Sections 3.4.5 and 5). It has also been claimed that PNP (from E. coli or a ``bacterial'' PNP of unknown source) catalyses the slow

hydrolysis of R-1-P, the rate at 21°C being 1 mM/min, hence, $ 2000-fold lower than that observed for phosphorolysis of the nucleoside substrate MESG (Nixon et al., 1998). This may be relevant to the earlier observation that in the absence of nucleosides and base, PNP catalyzes a slow exchange of phosphate between R-1-P and 32Pi in the medium (Friedkin & Kalckar, 1961; Jordan et al., 1979). With natural substrates, and some substrate analogues, where phosphorolysis is reversible, the equilibrium is thermodynamically in favour of nucleoside synthesis. With the human erythrocyte enzyme, and those from calf spleen and E. coli, the equilibrium constant (Keq) is $ 50 (Friedkin, 1950; Jensen & Nygaard, 1975; Salamone et al., 1982; Lehikoinen et al., 1989; Porter, 1992). Even more pronounced is Keq = 200 in favour of Ado synthesis, with the Ado phosphorylase from Bacillus subtilis (Senesi et al., 1976). It is relevant to note that most unusual substrates of PNPs (see Section 3.4.2) undergo phosphorolysis (or

370

synthesis; see Table 4) irreversibly, or with a Keq so small that the reaction is essentially irreversible. In vivo, phosphorolysis is the predominant reaction, due to coupling with other enzymes (see Fig. 1). This is, perhaps in part, why most kinetic data in the literature are on the phosphorolytic reaction; the high cost of R-1-P, and the less convenient assay methods for the reverse reaction, may also have been deterrents. 3.4.4. Non-Michaelis kinetics A frequent feature of the reaction catalyzed by PNPs is the non-Michaelis kinetics observed for some substrates, reflected by a downward curvature of the Lineweaver ± Burk plot of 1/vo vs. 1/co, or an upward curvature of Eadie ±Hofstee plots of vo vs. vo/co, or Scatchard plots of vo/co vs. vo (see Fig. 7a). Such behaviour is observed for all PNPs when the variable substrate is Pi (e.g., Jensen, 1976; Stoeckler, 1984; Ropp & Traut, 1991a; Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998), as well as for many nucleoside substrates (e.g., Agarwal & Parks, 1969; Ropp & Traut, 1991b). It is referred to as ``substrate activation at high substrate concentration'' and ``negative cooperativity.'' Numerous attempts to interpret the mechanism hitherto have proven, at best, frustrating, for example, with the substrate Ino a mixture of negative and positive cooperativity, as well as incorrect binding, leading to substrate inhibition at high substrate concentrations, were proposed, but models employed poorly fit the experimental data for low Ino concentrations (Ropp & Traut, 1991b). Although not valid for nonlinear kinetic or ligandbinding plots (Zierler, 1989; Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998; Wielgus-Kutrowska, 1999), in most cases straight lines are fitted to linear portions of the plots to obtain kinetic constants for low and high concentrations of a variable substrate separately, based on the assumption that classical Michaelis ± Menten kinetics holds within some concentration range (e.g., Agarwal & Parks, 1969; Moyer & Fisher, 1976; Choi et al., 1986). In some cases, the Hill equation, log[vo/(Vmax À vo)] versus log co, is fitted to the kinetic data (e.g., Jensen, 1976; Machida & Nakanishi, 1981; Ropp & Traut, 1991a, 1991b), but again, in most cases, this was done separately for data obtained over various concentration ranges, since Hill plots, like other kinetic plots, were found to be nonlinear (Fig. 7b). Moreover, as pointed out by Savage and Spencer (1979) for rabbit erythrocyte PNP, analysis of kinetic data in the form of a Hill plot, which refers to binding data, is valid only on the assumption that the fractional saturation of enzyme is proportional to the steady-state velocity over the entire range of substrate concentrations employed (Cornish-Bowden & Koshland, 1975), not verified in the case of PNP. The non-Michaelis kinetics observed for some substrates over a broad concentration range may be described for both trimeric (calf spleen and Cellulomonas) and hexameric (E. coli, trimer of dimers; see Section 4.2) PNPs by a kinetic equation assuming two sets of constants,

Km and Vmax (see Fig. 7c and Table 3A). It is not clear if two pairs of kinetic constants are due to non-homogeneity of the active sites or to other reasons. Mathematically, the equation employed is equivalent to equations describing cooperativity between monomers, random binding, and substrate inhibition (Segel, 1975). Recapitulating, an interpretation of the mechanism responsible for the complex kinetic behaviour of PNPs, and a model adequately describing the kinetics over a broad substrate concentration, have yet to be presented. With the human erythrocyte enzyme, the presence of isozymes with different kinetic properties (Stoeckler, 1984; Accorsi et al., 1991) further complicates the situation. In addition, assumptions of a rapid equilibrium for treatment of kinetic data are questionable, since release of the purine base may be the rate-limiting step, as shown for phosphorolysis of Guo by calf spleen PNP (Porter, 1992) and arsenolysis of Ino by the same enzyme (Kline & Schramm, 1993). 3.4.5. Stoichiometry of binding and possible cooperativity between subunits Several reports indicate that nonidentity of binding sites and cooperativity between subunits should be taken into account in analyzing both kinetic and binding data for PNPs (see the previous section). Ropp and Traut (1991a, 1991b) suggested that Pi binds to mammalian PNPs at two sites on each subunit of the enzyme, the low-affinity site playing a regulatory role. This conclusion initially was supported by the three-dimensional structure of human erythrocyte PNP (Ealick et al., 1990b), in which two sulphate ions per monomer were located. However, subsequent findings (Bzowska et al., 1995a; Koellner et al., 1997; Mao et al., 1998) do not support this, and the second sulphate anion observed by Ealick et al. (1990b) probably was due to crystallization conditions. Porter (1992) suggested that Pi binds to a single site of calf spleen PNP monomer, once as a substrate (in the phosphorolytic direction) and again after release of pentose-1-phosphate, as an effector to enhance rate-limiting release of the purine base. Ropp and Traut (1991a) presented data suggesting negative cooperativity (Hill coefficient nH = 0.5) for binding of Pi at a catalytic site, and positive cooperativity (nH = 10.8) for Pi at an allosteric site. With the murine enzyme and its Asn243Asp mutant, positive cooperativity for Pi was observed with nH = 7.95 and 3.79, respectively (Maynes et al., 1999). Binding of Pi and sulphate by E. coli PNP was best described by two dissociation constants (29 mM and 1.12 mM), and one dissociation constant (1.36 mM), respectively, while total binding capacity for both anions was 6 per enzyme hexamer. Furthermore, as it was anticipated, sulphate was an inhibitor of the enzyme, competitive with respect to Pi (Kierdaszuk et al., 1997). With the E. coli enzyme, emission spectroscopy (Kierdaszuk et al., 1997, 2000) and membrane filtration (Jensen, 1976) methods yielded equivocal results for stoichiometry of binding of other ligands. With the

formycins, which are selective inhibitors of E. coli PNP, one molecule bound per enzyme hexamer was observed in the presence and absence of Pi (Kierdaszuk et al., 2000); however, binding of the substrates Ado and Ade in the presence of phosphate proceeded with a stoichiometry of 4.2  1.5 and 3.6  0.4 molecules of ligand bound per enzyme hexamer, respectively (Jensen, 1976). Six molecules of formycin B per enzyme hexamer were localized by X-ray studies in the ternary complex of the enzyme with formycin B and sulphate (phosphate) (Koellner et al., 1998). Negative cooperativity in binding of the TS analogue inhibitors immucillins (see Section 6.2) with calf spleen PNP was observed. Initial kinetic studies (Miles et al., 1998) suggested one-third-the-sites reactivity, an extreme case of negative cooperativity, for which binding at one site (with Ki in the picomolar range) prevents binding at the remaining two sites. However, diffraction studies of the PNP/immucillin complex, crystallized with a monomer/inhibitor molar ratio of 1/1.1 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries 1B8N and 1B8O], revealed three molecules of ligand bound per enzyme trimer, indicating that the two remaining binding sites were also occupied, but with a much higher Ki. Hydrolysis of Ino, in the absence of Pi, in a one-third-ofthe sites reaction catalyzed by calf spleen PNP, leads to one Hx bound tightly per enzyme trimer. Similar stoichiometry was observed for binding of Hx with calf spleen PNP in the absence of Pi, while in the presence of Pi, three molecules of Hx are bound (Kline & Schramm, 1992). One-third-the-sites reactivity was also proposed in emission studies of binding of calf spleen PNP with several phosphonylalkoxyalkyl purines (Wierzchowski et al., 1999). Tight-binding conformation of the calf spleen enzyme leading to tight binding of Hx and immucillins with onethird-of-the-sites stoichiometry was suggested (Kline & Schramm, 1992; Miles et al., 1998). The release of R-1-P in the phosphorolytic reaction sequence is proposed to cause a rapid structural relaxation that facilitates Hx release (Kline & Schramm, 1992). Recapitulating, stoichiometry of ligand binding by lowmm and high-mm PNPs, and possible cooperativity between subunits, or nonidentity of active sites, call for more extensive studies. 3.4.6. Kinetic constants for natural substrates Kinetic data for phosphorolysis of natural substrates are too extensive to enumerate here, and Table 2 displays only relative substrate specificities. Table 3 presents reported kinetic constants for natural substrates for the most widely studied enzymes with known three-dimensional structures: from human erythrocytes, calf spleen, and E. coli. PNPs from other sources exhibit a similar pattern, with Km in the range 5 ± 100 mM, or where two constants were determined, the second is much higher. Where only one high constant for Pi is shown, data probably were determined in a narrow range of Pi concentrations, so that the presence of more than

one constant could not be detected (e.g., Bzowska et al., 1990). Difference in specificities between high-mm (E. coli) and low-mm (human erythrocyte) PNPs are reflected in kinetic constants for Ado and Ade in Table 3B. It is clear from the foregoing that comparison of kinetic constants reported by different observers must strictly take into account the conditions under which the data were obtained. 3.4.7. Order of substrate binding and product release A sequential mechanism (all substrate binds to the enzyme before any product is released) has been proposed for the enzyme from both high-mm E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium PNPs (Jensen, 1976; Krenitsky & Tuttle, 1982) and low-mm class PNPs from several sources (see Table 5). No evidence for a Ping-Pong mechanism, that is, for phosphorylated or ribosylated enzyme intermediates has been reported; attempts to identify phosphorylated intermediates for the enzymes from calf spleen, human erythrocytes, and E. coli were negative (Salamone et al., 1982). Studies proposing other than sequential mechanisms (e.g., Lewis & Glantz, 1976b) are rare, as are reports claiming ribosyl transfer by phosphate-free PNP (see Section 3.4.3 for scheme), and an intermediate stage for the transfer reaction involving ribosylated enzyme (e.g., Mora & Bozal, 1985). With the calf spleen and human erythrocyte enzymes, existence of ternary complexes enzyme/nucleoside/phosphate(sulphate) and enzyme/base/ R-1-P have been revealed by X-ray studies (Erion et al., 1997a; Mao et al., 1998, see Section 4). For the E. coli enzyme, the crystal structure of enzyme/nucleoside/phosphate(sulphate) was reported (Koellner et al., 1998). Therefore, it seems that a sequential mechanism with a central ternary complex of the enzyme with both its substrates is well-documented for PNPs from both low-mm and highmm classes. It is less clear whether the reaction proceeds via ordered binding of substrates or a random mechanism (substrates bind to, and/or products are released from, the enzyme in parallel reactions). For high-mm E. coli PNP, a mechanism (Table 5) with obligatory binding of pentose-1-phosphate prior to the purine base seems to be consistent with the architecture of the active site, in which phosphate- and pentose-binding sites are buried, while the base-binding site is exposed to solvent, and no specific interactions between the enzyme and the purine base are observed (see Section 4.5). However, existence of a binary complex of the enzyme with some purine bases is in accordance with an X-ray study on a three-dimensional structure with 6-iodopurine (Mao et al., 1997), and also could not be ruled out by ligand stabilization patterns, since some purine bases protect the E. coli enzyme against thermal inactivation and, hence, form binary complexes (Krenitsky & Tuttle, 1982; Bzowska et al., 1999). For low-mm PNPs, almost all possible sequential mechanisms have been proposed (see Table 5), even

for PNP from various tissues of the same organism (see calf spleen PNPs in Table 5). In a more recent and detailed study, Porter (1992) underlined that the proposed mechanism, with obligatory binding of phosphate prior to nucleoside in the phosphorolytic direction, is an oversimplification of the kinetic and binding data. It was later shown that this was really the case, since existence of binary complexes of the same calf spleen PNP with the nucleosides Ino and Guo was revealed by various methods (Kline & Schramm, 1992; Mao et al., 1998). The existence of a complex PNP/pentose-1-phosphate is only one of the possible binary complexes not obtained in X-ray studies of the calf spleen enzyme (Mao et al., 1998), in agreement with the kinetic mechanism for arsenolysis of Ino (Kline & Schramm, 1993), where binding of nucleoside and arsenate was proposed to be random, with release of R-1-P prior to that of hypoxanthine. The reason for discrepancies in reports describing the order of substrate binding and product release may be associated with the complex kinetic behaviour of PNP (see Section 3.4.4). Since non-Michaelis kinetics are observed for Pi and other substrates, analysis of mechanisms based on Michaelis± Menten kinetics for a Bi ±Bi reaction may lead to incorrect conclusions. Moreover, the purine base and pentose-1-phosphate may form a socalled ``dead-end'' ternary complex with PNPs from E. coli (Jensen & Nygaard, 1975; Jensen, 1976; Krenitsky & Tuttle, 1982; Bzowska et al., 1999), calf spleen (Porter, 1992), and Cellulomonas (Wielgus-Kutrowska, 1999), implying that additional alternative reaction pathways leading to a non-catalytic ternary complex should be taken into account.

The most probable kinetic mechanism for PNPs from various sources seems to be one with random binding in both phosphorolytic and synthetic directions with an alternative ternary complex (``dead-end'') enzyme/base/phosphate (see Fig. 8). However, the flux through the various reaction pathways probably depends markedly on the enzyme source, substrate employed, and other experimental conditions, and in some special cases, the real mechanism may be with good approximation represented by one of the simplified mechanisms proposed (Table 5). Proof of

Fig. 8. Schematic diagram for the most probable kinetic mechanism of PNPs from various sources. The mechanism [random binding in both phosphorolytic and synthetic directions with an alternative ternary complex (``dead-end'') enzyme/base/phosphate] is consistent with most, but not all, experimental data; however, the flux through various reaction pathways may differ markedly (see text). Lower and upper branches in the synthetic direction are not well documented in the case of low-mm and high-mm PNPs, respectively (see text). Schematic representation of addition of substrates and release of products is shown for the synthetic direction; for phosphorolysis, arrows for substrate addition should be reversed.

random binding in the synthetic direction would require evidence for existence of a binary complex of low-mm PNP with pentose-1-phosphate, of high-mm PNP with a purine base, and that the latter does not necessarily lead to subsequent formation of a ``dead-end'' ternary complex enzyme/purine base/Pi. 4. Three-dimensional structures Four PNPs from different sources have now been crystallized and their three-dimensional structures reported. Three of them are from the low-mm class: human erythrocytes (Ealick et al., 1990b; Narayana et al., 1997; entries in PDB 1ULA, 1ULB), calf spleen (Bzowska et al., 1995a; Koellner et al., 1997; Mao et al., 1998; entries in PDB 1VFN, 1A9O, 1A9P, 1A9Q, 1A9R, 1A9S, 1A9T, 1PBN, 3PNP, 4PNP), and Cellulomonas (Bzowska et al., 1998b; Tebbe et al., 1999; entries in PDB 1QE5, 1C3X), and E. coli PNP (deoD gene product) from the high-mm class (Mao et al., 1997; Koellner et al., 1998; entries in PDB 1ECP, 1A69). Recently, complexes of calf spleen PNP with the TS analogue inhibitors immucillins H and G (see Section 6.2) were crystallized and their three-dimensional structures deposited in the PDB (entries 1B8O and 1B8N). The resolution obtained in the diffraction studies ranges Ê Ê from 2.75 A for the human erythrocyte enzyme to 1.5 A for the complex of calf spleen PNP with immucillin H. Most available data are for the calf spleen enzyme, which crystallizes in the cubic space group P213, with one monomer in the asymmetric crystal unit (Bzowska et al., 1995a). In this space group, the monomers of the PNP trimer are related through the 3-fold crystallographic axes, so that discrimination between monomers is not possible. Therefore, the crystallographic structure does not contribute to clarification of the phenomenon of negative cooperativity/non-homogeneity of active sites observed for binding of some ligands (see Section 3.4.5). This holds for human erythrocyte PNP (space group R32; Ealick et al., 1990b), which, unfortunately, gives crystals of poor diffraction quality. Although many complexes were studied by X-ray diffraction (e.g., Erion et al., 1993; Montgomery et al., 1993), only two structures were deposited in the PDB. Cellulomonas PNP crystallized in the space group P212121, with all three monomers in the asymmetric unit (Bzowska et al., 1998b). Finally, the E. coli enzyme was crystallized in space groups with either three (space group P6122) or six (space group P21) monomers in the asymmetric unit (Cook et al., 1985; Mao et al., 1997). 4.1. Overall structure of low-molecular mass purine nucleoside phosphorylases Crystal studies revealed that calf spleen, human erythrocyte, and Cellulomonas PNPs are trimers with a very similar overall structure. The calf spleen and human erythrocyte

enzymes show a high degree of sequence homology, with only $ 40 residues that differ, but the sequence of the Cellulomonas PNP shares only 33% identity with the calf spleen enzyme (see Fig. 5). The structure of the calf spleen PNP trimer in a complex with hypoxanthine (Koellner et al., 1997) is displayed in Fig. 9, left panel. The core of one monomer consists of an extended b-sheet, classified according to Hutchinson & Thornton (1996) as a 9-stranded mixed b-barrel. This may be divided into two b-sheets: an 8stranded mixed b-sheet and a 5-stranded mixed b-sheet, joined at the edges, where four of the five strands of the smaller sheet are extensions of the larger one. The core of the monomer is surrounded by nine a-helices and two short 310 helices (calf spleen PNP), six a-helices and one 310 helix (human erythrocyte PNP), and six a-helices and two short 310-helices (Cellulomonas PNP). These secondary structural elements are linked by extended loops, a characteristic feature of all PNP molecules. The longest loop (27 and 21 residues, in calf spleen and Cellulomonas PNPs, respectively) is shown in orange in Fig. 9. This loop is involved in the trimerization process, since the majority of close contacts between each pair of monomers forming the trimer includes residues belonging to this loop in one monomer, and different regions of the second monomer (see Fig. 9). The central trimerization area includes a large number of hydrophobic residues, creating a strong hydrophobic environment around the 3-fold axis, which seems to contribute significantly to holding the biologically active trimer together. The active site is located close to the region of two interacting monomers within a trimer, with one amino acid from the long loop of the neighbouring monomer, Phe159 in the calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs, contributing to the ribose-binding site (see Fig. 9 and Section 4.4). These findings, as well as others (Miles et al., 1998; A. Bzowska, unpublished), question the claim (Ropp & Traut, 1991a) that the calf spleen PNP trimer dissociates in solution into highly active monomer subunits. Finally, it is worth noting that an unidentified metal cation, probably Zn2 + , was observed in the three-dimensional structure of calf spleen PNP, although it was not present in the crystallization protocol (Bzowska et al., 1995a; Koellner et al., 1997). Its location is far from the active site, as shown in Fig. 9, but it may be of interest that with the human erythrocyte enzyme, the presence of zinc ions was reported as a requirement for optimum inhibitory activity of a series of bisubstrate analogue inhibitors (Kelley et al., 1995; see Section 6.1.4), and maximum activity of PNP from Acholeplasma laidlawii is dependent on the presence of magnesium (McElwain et al., 1988). 4.2. Overall structure of high-molecular mass (Escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase The catalytically active molecule of E. coli PNP consists of six subunits.

Shown in orange is the long loop (27 residues), belting a monomer from one side and contributing to direct contacts between monomers. Location of an unidentified metal ion, probably Zn2 + , is shown in white with an enlarged van der Waals radius; although not present in the crystallization protocol, it was identified in the three-dimensional structure, coordinated by His20Ne of the three symmetry-related trimers. Reproduced from Koellner et al. (1997), with permission of the copyright holder, Academic Press, London. Right panel: Ternary complex of hexameric E. coli PNP with formycin B, a structural analogue of the substrate inosine, and phosphate (or sulphate). Ligands are indicated in red. The hexamer is built of three independent monomers (denoted A, B, and C) through 2-fold crystallographic symmetry, as shown. Helical regions are yellow, b-strands green, and loops blue. Reproduced from Koellner et al. (1998), with permission of the copyright holder, Academic Press, London. Note that scales are different for the two structures.

Ê Ê cylinder $ 60 A thick and 100 A in diameter, with an Ê diameter filled with water internal channel of $ 20 A molecules (see Fig. 9, right panel). A comprehensive view of the hexamer indicates, however, that the overall structure is better described as a trimer of dimers. The contacts between subunits forming dimers are more extensive than between trimers of dimers forming the holoenzyme. The nature of these interactions is mainly hydrophobic, albeit some hydrogen bonds are observed. As for the low-mm PNPs (see the previous section), the core of each monomer consists of a 9-stranded mixed bsheet, classified as a mixed b-barrel, consisting of a large central 8-stranded mixed b-sheet, and a smaller one, both linked at the edges, and surrounded by 8 a-helices. The active site is located on the surface of each monomer and is exposed to solvent. In the ternary complex of the enzyme with substrate analogues, each active site binds both ligands, inhibitor formycin B and phosphate (sulphate) (see Fig. 9; Koellner et al., 1998). The active sites of the monomers comprising a dimer are face to face, and mutually donate to each other His4 and Arg43, which are necessary to complete the active site. One active site in each dimer is located on

top, and one on the bottom, of the enzyme molecule, as depicted in Fig. 9. The distance between the active sites in Ê each dimer is $ 19 A. The E. coli enzyme was crystallized in space groups with either three, or all six, monomers in the asymmetric unit (see above). Possible differences between the 6 monomers in a space group P21 (Mao et al., 1997) were not discussed. In the space group P6122, there are 3 monomers in the asymmetric unit (monomers A, B, and C; see Fig. 9), and differences between them are observed, mainly in the Cterminal tail of each monomer (Koellner et al., 1998). In one monomer, this region is well resolved (monomer A), while in the other two (B and C), it is characterized by flexibility or disorder. The symmetry-related monomers AH, BH, and CH are formed by a 2-fold symmetry, as shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, the three dimers forming the biologically active hexamer are not crystallographically identical: Monomers forming dimers AC and AHCH are not identical in the C-terminal region, in contrast to dimer BBH (where the 2-fold crystallographic axis is the dimerization axis). This is relevant to experimental data for phosphate binding by E. coli PNP and

the proposal that the enzyme may adopt two different conformations of monomers, due to cooperative binding of phosphate (Jensen & Nygaard, 1975; Kierdaszuk et al.,

1997). Thus, the presence of the symmetrical dimer BB0 may be a purely crystal packing effect induced by the space group P6122, further supported by the three-dimensional

Fig. 10. Comparison of primary and secondary structural elements of PNPs from different sources: E. coli PNP, representing the high-mm class; calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs, representing the low-mm class; Cellulomonas (Cellul.) PNP, also a low-mm PNP, but not strictly specific in binding 6-oxopurines; and Mycobacterium leprae (Myc. lep.) PNP, structure unknown. In addition, E. coli PNP is compared with UP from the same source. Alignment is based on superimposition of the corresponding secondary structure elements. Alignment between human erythrocyte PNP, E. coli PNP, and UP was done according to Mao et al. (1997), but secondary structure elements are marked according to original data for crystal structures (see below) and the error in the E. coli PNP sequence (Lys193 was missing, see Hershfield et al., 1991; Mao et al., 1998) has been corrected. Numbers above a sequence refer to the upper of the two that are compared. Helices are shown as yellow areas and b-sheets as green areas in frames. Gaps introduced into a sequence for best alignment are shown as dots. Secondary structure elements are according to Koellner et al. (1997) for calf spleen PNP, Ealick et al. (1990b) for human erythrocyte PNP, Koellner et al. (1998) for E. coli PNP, Tebbe et al. (1999) for Cellulomonas PNP, and Morgunova et al. (1995) for the monoclinic form of E. coli UP. Active site amino acids observed in crystal structures are shown in red and are according to Koellner et al. (1997) and Mao et al. (1998) for the calf spleen enzyme; Ealick et al. (1990b), Erion et al. (1997a), and Narayana et al. (1997) for the human erythrocyte enzyme; Koellner et al. (1997) and Mao et al. (1998) for E. coli PNP; Tebbe et al. (1999) for Cellulomonas PNP; and Morgunova et al. (1995) for the monoclinic form of E. coli UP. Note that crystal structures are for binary or ternary complexes with different substrates or substrate analogues. For calf spleen, human erythrocyte, and E. coli PNPs, structures of ternary complexes, enzyme ± nucleoside ± phosphate (or sulphate), are available, so all amino acids that constitute base-, ribose-, and phosphate-binding sites probably were identified. In contrast, for Cellulomonas PNP, the ternary complex is not a catalytic, but a ``dead-end,'' complex, enzyme ± purine base ± phosphate (Tebbe et al., 1999), so that amino acids constituting the ribose-binding site probably were not identified. Conserved residues corresponding to active site amino acids are in bold italics. Note: Thr242 is an active site amino acid in calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs only with 8-aminoGua analogues as ligands (e.g., Montgomery et al., 1993). Tyr192 has contact with a phosphate oxygen via a highly ordered water molecule (Koellner et al., 1997; Mao et al., 1998). Glu89 in calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs has no direct contact with substrates, but is proposed to form a catalytic triad with His86 and phosphate (Erion, Stoeckler, et al., Ê 1997). In human erythrocyte PNP, Lys244 was described as an active site amino acid in a crystal structure at 3.2 A resolution (Ealick et al., 1990b). Ê Subsequently, with the structure refined at 2.75 A resolution, this residue was shown to be directed away from the active site, hence, having no contact with the purine base (Narayana et al., 1997). In E. coli PNP, Tyr160 has no direct contact with the purine base, but was described as an active site amino acid because, together with Phe159, it is involved in p ± p interactions with the base (Koellner et al., 1998).

structure of the enzyme with other ligands in a different space group (G. Koellner and A. Bzowska, unpublished). Hence, the E. coli PNP hexamer may be described as a trimer of asymmetric dimers. Finally, it should be noted that UP, a PyNP, is a hexamer sharing major structural features with E. coli PNP (Morgunova et al., 1995), although amino acid sequences of both enzymes show only  20% identity (Mao et al., 1997; see also Fig. 4). 4.3. Comparison of overall structures of low-molecular mass and high-molecular mass purine nucleoside phosphorylases Comparison of available three-dimensional structures of PNPs demonstrates that the monomers of these enzymes share many common structural features, as may be noted in Fig. 10, where secondary structural elements for PNPs from

calf spleen, human erythrocyte, Cellulomonas, and E. coli are shown. Monomers of calf spleen, Cellulomonas, and E. coli enzymes are displayed in Fig. 11, and superimposition of their central b-sheets is shown in Fig. 11, lower right. Depending on the atoms selected for comparison (Tebbe et Ê al., 1999), the root-mean-square deviations are  4 A for the main chain atoms of the entire molecules, but only  1 Ê Ê A between members of the low-mm class, and  2.4 A between low- and high-mm enzymes, when superimposition is for the b-sheet main chain atoms only (Fig. 11, lower right). It follows that the 9-stranded b-sheet cores of all enzymes are very similar, and some similarities of the surrounding helices also prevail (see Fig. 11). Moreover, as visualized in Fig. 11, the locations of the active sites relative to the central b-sheet, as well as the geometrical arrangement of the ligands in the active sites (see Sections 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6), are conserved. In each monomer, the Cterminal helix is the longest. None of the enzymes contains

the classical babab topology characteristic of the Rossmann fold (Rao & Rossmann, 1973), albeit both have phosphateand nucleoside-binding sites. Many residues in the active site are close to the middle four strands of the central bsheet. These four strands are parallel to each other, with their C-terminal ends directed to the active site. Overall, the structural similarity between the foregoing four PNPs is quite striking, bearing in mind the absence of sequence homology between the PNP from E. coli and those from calf spleen, human erythrocytes, and Cellulomonas, and the low homology between Cellulomonas and the two mammalian PNPs, e.g., only 33% identity for the calf spleen and Cellulomonas enzymes. 4.4. Active site of low-molecular mass purine nucleoside phosphorylases Structural details of the calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs were derived from analysis of binary and ternary complexes of these enzymes with substrates and substrate analogues (Ealick et al., 1990b; Bzowska et al., 1995a; Koellner et al., 1997; Narayana et al., 1997; Mao et al.,

1998). The few differences identified between human erythrocyte and calf spleen enzymes are discussed below. All active site amino acids in trimeric PNPs, together with their proposed role in binding of ligands and catalysis, are summarized in Table 6. Mammalian PNPs were crystallized in space groups with one monomer in the asymmetric unit; hence, no structural differences between the three active sites were identified. Those observed for the trimeric Cellulomonas PNP (Tebbe et al., 1999) are discussed below. The active sites are located near the boundaries of two neighbouring subunits of the trimer, but, with one exception (Phe159 in calf spleen and human erythrocyte enzymes), are composed of residues belonging to one monomer. The active site of a ternary complex of bovine spleen PNP with Ino and sulphate anion (Mao et al., 1998) is shown in Fig. 12. Some differences between this complex and other ternary and binary complexes are observed, and are discussed in the following sections. The active site can be divided into three parts, all buried in the protein structure: the phosphate-binding site, here occupied by sulphate, and the pentose- and base-binding sites, both occupied by Ino (Fig. 12).

Fig. 12. Mode of binding of inosine and sulphate in the active site of bovine spleen PNP, derived from the three-dimensional structure of the PNP ± inosine ± sulphate ternary complex (PDB entry 1A9S; Mao et al., 1998). Broken lines indicate possible hydrogen bonds. Two water molecules in the active site are shown as red spheres. Phe159 from a neighbouring subunit is shown in green. In this orientation, the hydrogen bond between the upper sulphate oxygen (03 according to the PDB file) and Ser33N is not visible. In this orientation, sulphate O2 is also not visible, and O1 and O4 are located to the left and right, Ê respectively. Glu89 and Thr192 are not shown (see Table 6 for their proposed roles). The possible hydrogen bond Asn243Nd to O6 of the base (3.44 A) is derived from data in the PDB file. Mao et al. (1998) show the side chain of Asn243 rotated in such a way that hydrogen bonds from Asn243Nd to N(7) of the Ê Ê base and Thr242Og, 3.2 A and 3.1 A, respectively, are possible (cf., Fig. 13). His64 is included, although the distance from His64Ne to the pentose O(10) is 3.49 Ê Ê Ê A in the PDB file, in contrast to 3.1 A reported in the article. The ribose 50-OH is reported to be in hydrogen bond contact (3.1 A) with Glu259Oe1, but in the Ê PDB file the distance is much longer (6.2 and 8.1 A for Glu259Oe1 and Glu259Oe2), precluding such contact.

4.4.1. Phosphate-binding site The phosphate-binding site is positively charged and consists of 1 arginine, Arg84 (Arg103 in Cellulomonas PNP), 1 histidine, His86 (His 105), 2 serines, Ser33 and Ser220 (Ser46 and Ser223), a main chain contribution from an alanine, Ala116N (corresponding to Gly135 in Cellulomonas PNP), and 1 water molecule. In the bovine, but not human erythrocyte, enzyme, participation of His64 in sulphate (phosphate) binding was observed. In Cellulomonas PNP, His78 (His64 in mammalian PNPs) is located in the flexible loop (residues 68± 80) not visible in the electron density map. The corresponding residues in the bovine enzyme (residues 56± 69) also form a flexible loop, which, together with the loop region 32 ± 36, undergoes a conformational change associated with binding of phosphate. In the absence of phosphate, this region adopts a single conformation. With high Pi concentration, both loops are well-ordered and form close contacts with the anion. At low phosphate, loops appear to be in an intermediate position. It was postulated (Mao et al., 1998) that this effect can be explained by communication between subunits associated with Pi binding, in line with some kinetic and binding data for phosphate, pointing to possible negative cooperativity or nonidentity of active sites (see Sections 3.4.4 and 3.4.5). Suggestions that these effects are due to existence of a second phosphate-binding site (e.g., Ealick et al., 1990b; Ropp & Traut, 1991a, 1991b) are not supported by the structure of calf spleen PNP (Koellner et al., 1997; Mao et al., 1998) or Cellulomonas PNP, where each of the monomers forming the trimer binds only one phosphate molecule, while small structural differences between the three monomers A, B, and C in Cellulomonas PNP are observed mainly at Arg103 (Arg84 in mammalian PNPs). This may be due to cooperativity between subunits, or nonidentity of binding sites, despite identity of amino acid sequences of the three monomers. However, as pointed out by Tebbe et al. (1999), small differences between the monomers A, B, and C may also be due to crystal packing effects. 4.4.2. Pentose-binding site The pentose-binding site is a rather hydrophobic part of the active site. Sugar oxygens O(20) and O(30) are hydrogen bonded to the main chain nitrogen Met219N and the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr88, respectively, while O(50) has contact with His257Nd. In addition, the 20- and 30-hydro-

xyls interact with two sulphate oxygen atoms, and the 20hydroxyl also with a water molecule. Other interactions involving the pentose ring are hydrophobic, and are maintained by residues His86, Tyr88, Phe200, and Phe159 from the neighbouring subunit. The two latter residues interact with the hydrophobic side of the pentose ring, while the hydrophilic side faces the phosphate anion. No threedimensional structure of Cellulomonas PNP complexed with R-1-P or a nucleoside is available; hence, no structural details of the pentose-binding site were characterized. However, sequence alignment based on three-dimensional structures of trimeric PNPs (Fig. 10) reveals that all residues constituting the pentose-binding site in mammalian PNPs are conserved in the Cellulomonas enzyme (with Phe200 replaced by Tyr203). 4.4.3. Base-binding site The base-binding site of low-mm PNPs is composed of a C-terminal portion of a b-strand (residues 116 ± 119 in calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs, or 135± 137 in Cellulomonas PNP), extending from the phosphate-binding site, a short b-strand, and a following g-turn (residues 217 ± 220, or 220 ± 223 in Cellulomonas PNP), also involved in phosphate and pentose binding. The opposite side of the base faces the phenolic ring of Phe200 (Tyr203 in Cellulomonas PNP). Hydrogen bond contacts of the base include the Asn243 side-chain, which donates the Nd1 hydrogen to purine O6, and the Glu201 side-chain linked to purine N(1) (see Fig. 12). The O6 group is linked to Glu201 via a water molecule. The side-chain of Lys244, previously suggested (for the human erythrocyte enzyme) to interact with the base O6, and to account for the specificity of trimeric PNPs versus 6oxopurines (Ealick et al., 1990b), is, in fact, both in bovine PNP (Koellner et al., 1997; Mao et al., 1998) and in the subsequently refined human erythrocyte enzyme structure (Narayana et al., 1997), directed away from the basebinding site. In Cellulomonas PNP (Tebbe et al., 1999), the Lys244 is replaced by leucine, while a murine Lys244Gln mutant shows only marginal reduction in the kcat/Km of the wild-type (Maynes et al., 1999). Both results support the conclusion that it is not the Lys244 that defines specificity and catalytic properties of trimeric PNPs. The loop region involving residues 244 ± 266 is highly disordered in the unliganded bovine PNP structure, reflected in the higher B-factors. Upon nucleoside or base binding,

Legend to Table 6: Active site amino acids in calf and human PNP crystal structures are those observed in ternary complexes of the enzyme with nucleoside (inosine, 9deazainosine, or 50-iodoformycin B) and phosphate (or sulphate) (Mao et al., 1997, 1998; Narayana et al., 1997), 8-aminoGua/sulphate, and 9-deazaguanine analogue/sulphate complexes (Montgomery et al., 1993). Small differences between active site amino acids in calf and human PNPs may be due to the fact that Ê Ê their structures were obtained at 2.2 A (inosine/sulphate and 9-deazainosine/phosphate complexes), and at only 2.75 A (50-iodoformycin B/sulphate complex) resolution, respectively. Conservation of active site amino acids is shown in the sequences of rat, mouse, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium leprae, xanthosine phosphorylase from E. coli (Erion et al., 1997a), Caenorhabditis elegans (Wilson et al., 1994), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Philipp et al., 1996), Aquifex aeolicus (Deckert et al., 1998), and Cellulomonas PNPs (Tebbe et al., 1999). a Erion et al.

this region (residues 241± 260) undergoes a conformational change that tends to increase the secondary structure from coil to helix. When the base-binding site is occupied, the Cterminal helix is extended by a little more than one turn at its N-terminal end, and includes residues 258 ±260. The maximum movement is associated with His257, which is disÊ placed by 2 ±6 A (Mao et al., 1998), allowing formation of a hydrogen bond with the O(50) of the pentose. This conformational change, induced by base or nucleoside binding, is independent of the conformational change observed in the phosphate-binding site, induced by binding of phosphate (see Section 4.4.1). The hydrogen bond pattern shown for the base in Fig. 12 is not the only one identified for trimeric PNPs. The pattern predicted for human erythrocyte PNP by modelling meth-

ods, using the atomic coordinates (Ealick et al., 1990b), is shown in Fig. 13a. For Ino and sulphate in the active site of bovine spleen PNP, Mao et al. (1998) assigned the pattern shown in Fig. 13b. However, it should be noted that the PDB file (entry 1A9S) with atomic coordinates for the same ternary complex (bovine PNP-Ino-sulphate), deposited by the same authors, results in the pattern shown in Fig. 12. For the ternary complex of bovine PNP/9-deazaIno/Pi, as well as for a variety of 9-deazaGua analogue inhibitors complexed with human erythrocyte PNP (e.g., Montgomery et al., 1993), N(7) of the base is protonated and donates a hydrogen to Asn243Od, while the Asn243Nd1 donates a hydrogen to the exocyclic O6 of the base, and a bridging water molecule to Glu201 is not observed (see Fig. 13c). A similar hydrogen bond pattern, but with the presence of

a water molecule interacting with the purine O6 and Glu201, was reported by Koellner et al. (1997) for the binary complex of the enzyme with Hx. Hence, the N(7) ± H tautomer of Hx is a preferred ligand (Fig. 13d). In contrast, Mao et al. (1998) identified a hydrogen bond pattern similar to that shown in Fig. 13b for binary and ternary complexes of bovine PNP with Hx (the latter with phosphate). In the Cellulomonas PNP ternary complex with 8-iodoguanine and phosphate, Asn246 (Asn243 in mammalian PNPs) has no direct contact to the 8-iodoguanine, but is bridged to O6 via a water molecule. The base is recognized by a zigzag pattern of hydrogen bonds: purine N(1)± H to Glu204Oe1 (Glu201Oe1 in mammalian PNPs) and Glu204Oe1 to guanine NH2, which, in turn, contacts Glu204Oe2 (see Fig. 13e). In two monomers (C and B), the water molecule bridging the exocyclic O6 of the base with Glu204Oe1 was identified, while in the third monomer (A), this was not observed. The fact that hydrogen bond contact of the exocyclic O6 of the base with Asn246 is established via a water molecule may explain why Cellulomonas PNP, in contrast to other trimeric PNPs, is able to bind Ado in the active site (Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998), and how this bond plays a role in the mechanism of catalysis by trimeric PNPs (Tebbe et al., 1999; see Section 5). Finally, different hydrogen bond patterns are observed for binary and ternary complexes of a N(7)-acycloguanosine inhibitor with calf spleen PNP (the latter with a sulphate or Ï phosphate anion; Bzowska et al., 1995a; Luic et al., 2001; see Fig. 13f). In these complexes, the inhibitor is bound in the active site in an inverted (upside-down) orientation of the purine base relative to that for natural substrates. These patterns again involve residues Glu201 and/or Asn243. The only ligand ± protein hydrogen bond interaction present in all complexes of trimeric PNPs in which the base-binding site that is occupied is that which bridges N(1) ± H of the base with the side-chain of Glu201 (Glu204) is further discussed in Section 5 in the context of the catalytic mechanism. 4.5. Active site of high-molecular mass (Escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase The active site of E. coli PNP, the only member of this class hitherto studied by X-ray diffraction, is shown in Fig. 14. The data were derived from the ternary complex of the enzyme with the inhibitor formycin B, a close structural analogue of Ino (see Fig. 26), and sulphate (phosphate) described by Koellner et al. (1998). As outlined in Section 4.2, the overall structure of the E. coli enzyme may be described as a trimer of dimers (see Fig. 9, right panel). The active sites of monomers comprising a dimer are face-toface, and His4 and Arg43 from the neighbouring monomer are necessary to complete the phosphate- and pentosebinding sites. One active site in each dimer is opened above, and one below, the plane formed by the center of gravity of

the monomers, as shown in Fig. 9, right panel. The distance Ê between the active sites in one dimer is  19 A. It should be recalled that three monomers (A, B, and C in Fig. 9) are present in the asymmetric unit in the crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme with formycin B and sulphate (phosphate). Small structural differences between the active sites of the three monomers are observed, mainly in one region near the active site, discussed at the end of this section. The active site of monomer A is shown in Fig. 14. All active site amino acids in E. coli PNP, and their proposed roles in binding of ligands and catalysis, are listed in Table 7. The active site can be divided into three parts: the phosphate-binding site and the pentose- and base-binding sites occupied by the inhibitor formycin B. The phosphatebinding site is occupied either by sulphate, used as a precipitating agent in crystallization of the enzyme, or by phosphate, which was in contact with the enzyme during purification (Koellner et al., 1998). 4.5.1. Phosphate-binding site The phosphate-binding site is positively charged by three arginine residues, and is the most buried part of the active site. It consists of Gly20N, Arg24Nh, Arg87Nh, Ser90N, Ser90Og, and Arg43Nh, the last residue from the adjacent monomer of a dimer. All sulphate (phosphate) oxygen atoms form at least two hydrogen bonds or salt bridges with the protein. Sulphate (phosphate) anion is also in contact with oxygens O(20), O(30), and O(40) of the pentose ring (see Fig. 14). 4.5.2. Pentose-binding site The pentose-binding site is in close proximity to the sulphate (phosphate) anion, and only its 50-OH has no direct contact with it. The 50-OH is located on the opposite side of the pentose ring, relative to the phosphate-binding site, and forms a hydrogen bond with His4Ne from the adjacent monomer. Pentose hydroxyl groups O(30)± H and O(40) ±H are bridged by Glu181Oe and Ser90Og, respectively. The 20OH has three direct contacts with the protein: Arg87Nh, Met180N, and Glu181Oe. In addition, hydrophobic van der Waals contacts between the pentose and protein are observed. They include Val178 ± Glu179 ± Met180 and Phe159 (Mao et al., 1997), the first two not shown in Fig. 14. The nucleoside is bound in the high-syn conformation about the glycosidic bond, with the torsion angle c [C(4) ± N(9)± C(10)± O(40)] in the range 100 ±130° in monomers A, B, and C. 4.5.3. Base-binding site The base-binding site is largely exposed to solvent. A network of water molecules is observed, starting at the ring atom N(1) of the base and the exocyclic O6. An assembly of p ± p interactions between the base, Phe159, and Tyr160 is present, with centroid separations between the aromatic Ê moieties of  5 A (Koellner et al., 1998). A number of hydrophobic residues are found in the base-binding site.

Phosphate (sulphate) O1 is to the left, with O2, O3, and O4 located counterclockwise. Not all putative hydrogen bonds are visible in this orientation, and not all residues involved in hydrophobic interactions with ligands are shown (see Table 7 for further details). Five water molecules present in the active site are shown as red spheres, one located on top of the nucleoside-binding site, four others as a chain in the region of the active site exposed to solvent. Possible hydrogen bonds are indicated by broken lines. Reproduced from Koellner et al. (1998), with permission of the copyright holder, Academic Press, London.

According to Mao et al. (1997), these are: Val178, Met180, and Leu206. In addition, a portion of the b-strand formed by residues 84 ± 93 (see Fig. 10); namely, Ser90 ± Cys91 ± Gln92, extends from the phosphate-binding site to the base-binding site (not shown in Fig. 14). There are only two possible alternative, hydrogen bond contacts of the formycin B aglycone to the protein, bearing in mind that, in solution, formycin B consists of an equilibrium mixture of two prototropic tautomers, N(7)± H and N(8) ±H, with populations of 85% and 15%, respectively (Wierzchowski & Shugar, 1982). The N(8)± H tautomer of formycin B may donate a hydrogen to the Ser90Og, and the N(7) ±H tautomer to Asp204Od. With the substrate Ino in place of formycin B, the corresponding C(8) ±H would lead to only a weak hydrogen bond to Ser90Og, while N(7) does not carry a donor hydrogen, so that contact with Asp204Od is unfavoured, unless the latter is protonated. With Ado, contact of the 6-amino group with Asp204 appears possible. The architecture of the base-binding site, and the fact that protein/

base interactions are achieved mainly via nonspecific p ±p interactions of the base with Phe159 and Tyr160, clearly account for the broader specificity of the E. coli enzyme versus purine bases and their nucleosides, when compared with low-mm PNPs. Differences between active sites in all six monomers in the space group P21 (Mao et al., 1997) were not discussed, probably because the electron density for the ligands was poorly defined and accurate location of the substrates was not possible. In the space group P6122, there are three monomers in the asymmetric unit (monomers A, B, and C). Therefore, the enzyme hexamer is composed of two asymmetrical dimers, AC and A0C0, and one symmetrical, BB0 (see Fig. 9, right panel). However, the presence of the symmetrical dimer is most probably a purely crystal-packing effect (see Section 4.2). Fig. 14 shows the active site of monomer A. The water molecule is located on top of the nucleoside-binding site and bridges the N(8) of the base and the pentose oxygen atoms O(40) and O(50). This water

Active site amino acids in the E. coli PNP crystal structure are those observed in the ternary complex of the enzyme with a nucleoside inhibitor (formycin B) and phosphate (or sulphate) (Koellner et al., 1998). Included are active center amino acids proposed by Mao et al. (1997), based on binary complexes of the enzyme with 6-iodopurine, ribose-1-phosphate, and sulphate, although electron densities of the ligands were weak and poorly defined. Conservation of active site amino acids is shown in the sequences of PNPs from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (Vezina et al., 1998), Haemophilus influenzae (Fleischmann et al., 1995), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Takehara et al., 1995), Lactococcus lactis (Duwat et al., 1997), Treponema pallidum (Fraser et al., 1998), Bacillus subtilis (Kunst et al., 1997), Bacillus stearothermophilus (Hamamoto et al., 1997a), Helicobacter pylori (Tomb et al., 1997), Mycoplasma genitalium (Fraser et al., 1995), and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Himmelreich et al., 1996). a Mao et al. (1998) show Phe167 as an active site amino acid, but in the PNP/formycin B/sulphate(phosphate) ternary complex structure (Koellner et al., Ê 1998), this residue appears too distal (closest distance, Ce to N(1), is 6.4 A) to interact with any of the substrates.

molecule has a hydrogen bonding contact to the side-chain of Arg217, located in the flexible loop between the b-strand and the C-terminal helix (see Fig. 10). In monomer A, this loop folds over the active site, while in monomers B and C, this region is only poorly defined in the electron density map, due to flexibility or disorder. No such water molecule is found in monomers B and C, and this also affects the hydrogen bond pattern of the ribose and phosphate (see Koellner et al., 1998). In monomers B and C, the side-chain of Asn204 is slightly shifted in comparison with monomer A, and no contacts of this residue with the base are observed, nor is there a water molecule in contact with N(1) of the base in monomer A (see Fig. 14) Overall, there are fewer hydrogen bond contacts in the active sites of monomers B and C, as compared with A. 4.6. Comparison of active sites of low-molecular mass and high-molecular mass purine nucleoside phosphorylases As shown in Figs. 10 and 11, monomers of trimeric and hexameric PNPs share many structural features, including location of the active sites relative to the central b-sheet and the geometrical arrangement of ligands bound in the active site. In the active sites of both E. coli and mammalian PNPs, nucleosides bind with the purine base aligned along the C(10)± C(20) bond of the pentose, with a conformation about the glycosidic bond, c = 145° for mammalian PNP and 100 ±130° for E. coli PNP. These values of c differ from those for free purine nucleosides in the solid state and in solution (Saenger, 1984). Erion et al. (1997a) suggested that these unusual glycosidic torsion angles may play an important role in phosphorolysis. In this context, it is worth noting that 6-methyluridine, which is in the fixed syn conformation, is a good substrate of UPs from Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli (Krajewska & Shugar, 1982). However, the similarity in overall structure of trimeric and hexameric PNPs in the localization of the active site relative to the central b-sheet and in the location and orientation of the ligands bound in the active site relative to each other and to the secondary structure elements has little influence on the details of the architecture of the active sites in both low- and high-mm PNPs. There are many contributions to the active site from loops and turns, which differ between the two enzyme classes. The key difference derives from the fact that in trimeric enzymes, the active site is composed, with one exception (Phe168 in Cellulomonas and Phe159 in mammalian PNPs), of amino acids belonging to a single monomer, while in E. coli PNP, a dimer of two neighbouring subunits constitutes the functional unit, each monomer donating to the neighbouring active site two residues, His4 and Arg43, both interacting directly via hydrogen bonds with the ligands (pentose and phosphate) necessary to complete the active site of the neighbouring monomer. This is not the case for Phe159 in mammalian PNPs, which does not interact via hydrogen bonds with any of the ligands, and is located distally from the ligands bound

in the active site. Therefore, in principle, one may imagine a free monomer of a trimeric PNP possessing catalytic activity, as postulated by Ropp and Traut (1991a), but this hypothesis is not supported by other studies (see Section 3.3). In contrast, the three-dimensional structure of E. coli PNP shows that at least two monomers are necessary to constitute a functional catalytic unit. The distance between Ê Ê closest active sites is  19 A in E. coli PNP and  35 A in trimeric PNPs. The phosphate-binding site is the most buried part of the active site in the E. coli PNP, and the base-binding site is exposed to solvent, while in the trimeric PNPs, the entire active site is buried in the protein structure. In the hexameric enzyme, the phosphate-binding site is much more positively charged than in trimeric PNPs, since it is composed of three arginine residues (Arg24, Arg87, and Arg43, the last from a neighbouring subunit), with one additional arginine residue (Arg217) also approaching the active site. In trimeric PNPs, only one arginine residue is found in the phosphate-binding site (Arg84 in mammalian PNP, Arg103 in Cellulomonas PNP); two other corresponding residues are His86 and Ser220. In both trimeric and hexameric enzymes, participation of main chain nitrogen atoms was identified: viz., Ser33 and Ala116 in mammalian PNPs (Ser46 and Gly135 in Cellulomonas PNP) and the corresponding Gly20 and Ser90 in the E. coli enzyme (see Figs. 12 and 14). The latter residue of each pair (Ala116, Gly135, and Ser90) belongs to the b-strand conserved in all structures (see Fig. 10), extending from the phosphate- to the base-binding site. It is worth noting that this subtle structural homology was revealed by computer-assisted sequence analysis (Mushegian & Koonin, 1994), before X-ray studies revealed detailed three-dimensional structures of trimeric and hexameric PNPs. Both trimeric and hexameric PNPs use hydrophobic van der Waals contacts to interact with the hydrophobic site of the pentose ring, while the hydrophilic site with its hydroxyl groups faces the phosphate-binding site. Hydrogen bonds between O(20), O(30), O(40), and phosphate are observed in E. coli PNP, while for the bovine enzyme, the last contact is not present. In both enzymes, O(50) interacts with a histidine residue, His257Nd in bovine PNP (the residue that undergoes maximal displacement upon ligand binding in the basebinding site; see Section 4.4), and His4Ne from the neighbouring subunit in E. coli PNP. Thus, in the E. coli enzyme, the pentose-binding site, like the phosphate-binding site, is completed by a residue from an adjacent subunit. In trimeric enzymes, participation of Phe159 from an adjacent subunit completes the hydrophobic environment near the pentose group, but this residue is not located in the proximity of the sugar ring. Phe159 in E. coli PNP (by chance with the same residue number) occupies a similar region in the active site as Phe159 from an adjacent subunit in mammalian PNPs (see Fig. 14). In both trimeric and hexameric enzymes, the main chain nitrogen atoms of a methionine residue (Met219N and Met180N, respectively) form a hydrogen

385

bond to the pentose, and in both cases, these methionine residues lie across the hydrophobic face of the pentose ring. The base-binding sites in trimeric and hexameric PNPs differ in some significant respects. In E. coli PNP, this element of the active site is highly exposed to solvent. The N(1) ±H of the base, involved in a hydrogen bond with Glu201 (or Glu204) in the mammalian (or Cellulomonas) enzymes, is linked to a chain of water molecules in hexameric PNP, and has no contact with the protein (see Fig. 14). The loop that contains Glu201 (Glu204) in Ê mammalian (Cellulomonas) PNP, is displaced  8 A from the base-binding site in E. coli PNP, leaving this part of the base-binding pocket accessible to solvent molecules. Furthermore, formycin B atoms N(8) and N(7) may form a hydrogen bond with the E. coli enzyme (to Ser90 or Asp204), depending on the tautomeric form of the ligand (Fig. 14). None of these is possible with the natural substrates Ado, Ino, and Guo (the latter would be if Asn204 were protonated). For Ado, one may propose contact of Asn204Od to the amino group at C(6) of the base. It follows that the base-binding site in E. coli PNP is nonspecific, and base binding is due mainly to p ±p interactions with Phe159 and Tyr160 (see Fig. 14). In mammalian PNPs, binding of a base or a nucleoside induces a conformational change, resulting in a transition from coil to helix in the region 241 ±260. This change is unlikely to occur in a similar manner in E. coli PNP, since the corresponding loop (residues 206± 213) is much shorter and well-ordered in the unliganded structure (Mao et al., 1997). However, in the ternary complex with formycin B and sulphate (or phosphate), this region, together with the following kinked helix (residues 214± 236, see Fig. 10), adopts different conformations in monomers A, B, and C, and in some regions, the electron density is weak, pointing to flexibility or disorder (Koellner et al., 1998). Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme with ligands other than formycin B shows that this region may adopt two conformations. In one, the loop folds over the active site, while in the other, it is shifted several angstroms away from it, leaving the active site more open and accessible (G. Koellner and A. Bzowska, unpublished). Summarizing, differences in the architecture of the active sites between trimeric and hexameric PNPs, especially pronounced in the base-binding pockets, reflect the differences in specificity between these two classes of PNP (see Section 3.4.1). 5. Catalytic mechanism: active site mutants PNP cleaves the glycosidic bond of natural purine nucleosides in the b-configuration, with inversion of configuration, to produce R-1-P. Enzyme kinetics indicate that catalysis occurs via a ternary complex of enzyme with both its substrates, and proceeds without involvement of a phosphorylated or ribosylated enzyme intermediate (see

Section 3.4). Interpretation of kinetic data, however, reveals discrepancies in the order of substrate binding and product release (see Section 3.4.7). Mechanisms of catalysis have been addressed mainly to trimeric PNPs, more precisely, to the human erythrocyte, calf spleen, and Cellulomonas enzymes, extensively investigated by a variety of methods, and leading to three different proposed mechanisms. Initial attempts to elucidate the reaction mechanism were based on a comparison of PNP-catalyzed phosphorolysis and nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond of purine nucleosides. The latter proceeds in acidic pH via protonation of N(7) of the purine base, resulting in a positive charge on the imidazole ring, leading to delocalization of electron density at the glycosidic bond, facilitating bond cleavage (Zoltewicz et al., 1970). Taking into account the specificity of trimeric PNPs versus 6-oxopurines, above, and the experimental evidence for participation of essential histidine, cysteine, and arginine residues in the catalytic mechanism (see Stoeckler, 1984), Carlson & Fisher (1979) proposed a model in which histidine interacts with both N(1) and O6 of the base, while cysteine protonates N(7). This was found to be incorrect when the first crystal structure of a trimeric PNP was published (Ealick et al., 1990b), showing that only the side-chain of Asn243 (Asn246 in Cellulomonas PNP; see Figs. 12 and 13) is in the vicinity of N(7). However, a possible role of N(7) protonation as an intermediate in phosphorolysis subsequently was supported by additional experimental evidence. The kinetic a-deuterium isotope effects for phosphorolysis (Stein & Cordes, 1981; Lehikoinen et al., 1989) and arsenolysis catalyzed by PNP, and TS modelling (Kline & Schramm, 1993), were found to be consistent with protonation of the purine ring N(7) (see Schramm, 1999). Furthermore, quantitative structure ± activity relationships (QSARs) for a series of N(7)substituted guanosine substrates for the same enzyme were developed and compared with those for nonenzymatic acid hydrolysis of these analogues (Bzowska et al., 1993). There was no correlation between the rates for enzymatic phosphorolysis and acid hydrolysis, indicating that for the enzymatic reaction, labilization of the glycosidic bond is not the predominant effect of N(7) substitution. Multiple regression analysis of the enzymatic process was consistent with the hypothesis of protonation of N(7) of the base by the enzyme as one step in the catalytic mechanism for the calf spleen PNP. The above-mentioned kinetic a-deuterium isotope effects have been taken to indicate that bond cleavage precedes bond making, hence, an SN1 mechanism, and that the ribose ring in the TS has oxocarbenium character, so that the features of the TS are localized in the nucleoside (Fig. 15, upper panel; see Schramm, 1999). Attack by phosphate (arsenate) was proposed to lag far behind glycosidic bond breakage. This was consistent with the hydrolytic activity observed for calf spleen PNP versus Ino (Kline & Schramm,

The attacking arsenate, here shown as the monoanion (pKa = 6.8, hence, similar Ê to that of the phosphate monoanion, pKa = 7.2; Jordan & Wu, 1978), is distal from C(1H) by 3 A, hence, in only weak van der Waals contact. Erion et al. (1997a) propose that phosphate attacks as the dianion (see Section 5). Modified from Schramm (1999).

1992, 1995): In the absence of phosphate, the enzyme was able to very slowly hydrolyze Ino to Hx and ribose, with release of the latter and formation of a stable enzyme± Hx complex. The release of pentose-1-phosphate in the normal phosphorolytic reaction sequence was proposed to cause a rapid structural relaxation of the enzyme, which facilitates release of Hx. The stabilization by the enzyme of the oxocarbenium ion character of the pentose ring in TS was further supported by the extremely potent binding (Ki in picomolar range) of immucillins, that is, transition-state analogue inhibitors in which the features of ribooxocarbenium ion are provided by an iminoribitol moiety (see Fig. 15). The oxocarbenium ion character of the TS, furthermore, was found to be a common catalytic feature of purine N-ribohydrolases, phosphorylases, and transferases, so-called N-ribose scission enzymes (Mazzella et al., 1996; Schramm, 1997, 1999). Hence, it is not surprising that immucillins, and/or their

5H-MPs, are TS inhibitors of such enzymes as human erythrocyte and malarial HGPRT (Li et al., 1999; Shi et al., 1999a) and nucleoside hydrolases from Leishmania maior and Crithidia fasciculata (Degano et al., 1998; Shi et al., 1999b). N-ribose scission enzymes also share the mechanism of activating the purine-leaving group by protonation or hydrogen bonding to effect electron withdrawal (Schramm, 1997), for example, in the case of AMP nucleosidase, an enzymatic acidic residue is proposed to protonate the adenine-leaving group at N(7) (De Wolf et al., 1979; Schramm, 1997). However, for PNP-catalyzed glycosidic bond cleavage, the situation seems to be more complex, and definite conclusions regarding the mechanism of activation of the purine ring are still lacking. The hypothesis of protonation of N(7) of the base by the enzyme as a catalytic mechanism for trimeric PNPs was followed by the proposal of a negatively charged purine ring in the TS (Porter, 1992;

A. Bzowska et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 88 (2000) 349±425

Erion et al., 1997a), based on the following experimental findings. Fluorescence of calf spleen PNP complexed with Gua was markedly increased relative to fluorescence of other enzyme ± ligand complexes (Porter, 1992), leading to the proposal that the enzyme preferentially binds the anion of Gua. This, in turn, pointed to the possibility that in the TS, the negative charge accumulated on the purine ring during glycosidic bond cleavage is stabilized by trimeric PNPs (Porter, 1992; Erion et al., 1997a). This is in line with the pentose having an oxocarbenium ion character in the TS, since a shift of electrons from the pentose ring into the purine ring will result (assuming the base was not preprotonated by the enzyme) in a negatively charged purine intermediate anion and a positively charged pentose intermediate cation. As mentioned above, X-ray studies of calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNP complexes with various ligands failed to identify an acidic residue in contact with N(7), which additionally questions the protonation hypothesis. The residue Asn243 of the mammalian enzymes (Asn246 in Cellulomonas PNP), localized in the vicinity of N(7) of the base, seems to be flexible, and may adopt

different conformations, depending on the ligand in the active site (see Figs. 12 and 13). One of these conformations results in a hydrogen bond between Asn243Nd and N(7) of the base, postulated to stabilize the TS, that is, the negatively charged purine base with charge delocalization between N(9) and N(7) (Erion et al., 1997a). A key role of Asn243 in catalysis apparently was supported by structure ± function studies of single point mutants of human erythrocyte PNP (Erion et al., 1997b; Stoeckler et al., 1997). An Asn243Ala mutant exhibited a 1000-fold decrease in the kcat for Ino. This result, together with the 10- to 25-fold reduced catalytic efficiency of His86Ala and Glu89Ala mutants, led to a proposal for the catalytic mechanism for mammalian PNPs (Erion et al., 1997a; Fig. 16), whereby the oxocarbenium ion is stabilized by the phosphate dianion, which itself functions as part of a catalytic triad (Glu89 ±His86 ± phosphate). Glu201 was not included in this catalytic mechanism (Fig. 16). His86 accepts a proton from the phosphate, so that the latter is formally a dianion. Attack by this highly negatively charged species leads to a shift of electrons from the

ribose into the purine ring, and, hence, to a ribooxocarbenium character of the pentose in the TS. Simultaneously, the Asn243 ±N(7) hydrogen bond pulls electrons from the glycosidic bond to the purine ring. Hence, features of the TS are attained by attack of the phosphate dianion, which both initiates bond cleavage and stabilizes the intermediate oxocarbenium ion. Glu201 is only indirectly involved, in that it participates in the binding of the substrate in a highenergy unusual conformation of the latter about the glycosidic bond (c = 145° for mammalian PNP and 100 ± 130° for E. coli PNP; see Section 4.6), considered to facilitate glycosidic bond cleavage. The mechanism proposed by Erion et al. (1997a) differs from that of Schramm and co-workers (see Schramm, 1999) in that the mode of interaction of the purine ring with the enzyme is by hydrogen bonding and not by protonation, as well as in the role of phosphate in catalysis. Such a mechanism, particularly the role of Asn243 in stabilization of a negatively charged purine base intermediate, is not fully consistent with other experimental data, for example, it does not explain why Ado has negligible substrate activity with trimeric PNPs. Furthermore, a marked decrease in the kcat for Ino, even more pronounced for Guo (10,000-fold; Stoeckler et al., 1997), was observed for a Glu201Ala mutant. Moreover, the Asn243Asp mutant shows a 5000-fold increase in kcat and a 4300-fold increase in kcat/Km for Ado, relative to the wild-type human erythrocyte enzyme (Stoeckler et al., 1997). The same mutant exhibits a several-fold higher Km for Ino, and a 25-fold decrease in kcat for this substrate, so the overall catalytic efficiency kcat/Km was reduced 200-fold. Similar results were obtained for an Asn243Asp mutant of murine PNP (Maynes et al., 1999). Stoeckler et al. (1997) proposed that a protonated Asp243 may hydrogen bond to the 6-amino group, and donate a hydrogen to N(7) of the base, as required for TS stabilization. The residue Asp243 in the mutant would then correspond to Asp204, located in the same position relative to the purine base in the threedimensional structure of hexameric E. coli PNP (cf., Figs. 12 and 14). The latter enzyme accepts both 6-oxo- and 6aminopurines as substrates, but its active site contains no amino acid corresponding to Glu201 in mammalian PNPs, and the N(1) of the base is linked to a chain of water molecules (see Figs. 12 and 14). In the case of several MTA phosphorylases (see Fig. 5), Glu201 is replaced by Ser and Asn243 by Asp, taken to support a catalytic role of Asn243 in PNPs specific for 6-oxopurines (Erion et al., 1997a; Stoeckler et al., 1997). However, a double-mutant of human erythrocyte PNP (Asn243Asp;Glu201Ala) retained catalytic activity for Ado (kcat 200-fold higher and kcat/Km 100-fold higher than for the wild-type), while catalytic activity for Ino and Guo was negligible, kcat $ 10 À 5 and kcat/Km $ 10 À 7 those for the wild-type enzyme (Stoeckler et al., 1997). This points to a key role of Glu201 in catalysis of 6-oxopurine substrates by trimeric PNPs.

Further insight was provided by the kinetic properties and three-dimensional structure of Cellulomonas PNP (Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998; Tebbe et al., 1999), a member of the low-mm class, since it is a trimer and does not cleave Ado. However, Ado is a competitive inhibitor. The three-dimensional structure reveals that Asn246 (Asn243 in mammalian PNPs) does not interact directly with the purine base, but is bridged to the exocyclic substituent at C(6) via a water molecule (see Fig. 13e), while direct contact of the purine base with Glu204 (corresponding to Glu201) is retained. This led to the proposal of an alternative mechanism of catalysis by trimeric PNPs (Tebbe et al., 1999) in which the key catalytic role in stabilization of the negatively charged purine base intermediate in the TS is played by Glu201 (Glu204), while the role of Asn243 is recognition of substrates rather than catalytic (see Fig. 17). The phosphate anion attacks the C(1H) of the pentose and weakens the glycosidic bond, causing a shift of electrons into the purine ring, resulting in a negatively charged purine intermediate. In contrast to an earlier proposal (Fig. 16), the negative charge is localized at the purine O6, thus forming an anion of the purine base intermediate, analogous to the rare tautomeric enolic forms of Guo and Ino. The role of Glu201 (Glu204) is to prevent reconstitution of the keto tautomer via hydrogen bond interaction with N(1)± H. Recapitulating, the catalytic mechanism for low-mm PNPs is not adequately elucidated as yet, and alternative proposals exist with regard to the catalytic role of Pi, the amino acid residues that stabilize the TS, and even the electronic state of the purine ring in the TS. For high-mm PNPs, investigations have been limited to the demonstration, in the case of E. coli PNP, of a TS with oxocarbeniumlike character (Stein & Cordes, 1981; Lehikoinen et al., 1989). No active site mutants of high-mm PNPs and only two three-dimensional structures are available, viz. E. coli, and its ternary complex with formycin B and phosphate (sulphate) (see Section 4). Nonetheless, structural and kinetic data for wild-type E. coli PNP and sequence comparisons with other homologous phosphorylases permit some tentative conclusions. The low-mm and high-mm classes of PNPs differ in the residues stabilizing the purine-base intermediate in the TS. In hexameric E. coli PNP, and probably other homologous enzymes (see Fig. 4), as well as MTA phosphorylases that show homology to low-mm PNPs (Fig. 5), the key catalytic role is then associated with Asp204 (corresponding to Asn243 in mammalian PNP and Asn246 in Cellulomonas PNP), a residue conserved in all PNPs homologous to E. coli PNP (and not conserved in UPs, which are homologous to E. coli PNP). It is also conserved in enzymes homologous to calf spleen and human erythrocyte PNPs, but with Glu201 substituted by Ser, and specific, where tested, for MTA as substrate (see Fig. 5). With low-mm PNPs specific for 6-oxopurines, the most essential residues appear to be the highly conserved Glu201 and Asn243, since replacement of each by Ala

structures of human MTAP (homologous to low-mm PNPs), one complexed with Ade, the other with MTA and sulphate (Appleby et al., 1999; PDB entry 1CB0, 1CG6), Asp220 (corresponding to Asp204 in E. coli and Asn243 in mammalian PNPs) interacts via a hydrogen bond with the amino group and N(7) of the purine, while Ser178 (corresponding to Glu201 in mammalian PNPs) has contact with N(1) of the base via a water molecule. 6. Inhibitors Because of their potential clinical applications, many base, nucleoside, and nucleotide analogues have been synthesized and tested as PNP inhibitors, mainly of the human erythrocyte and calf spleen enzymes (see Stoeckler, 1984; Stoeckler et al., 1986a; Sircar & Gilbertsen, 1988; Bugg et al., 1993; Montgomery, 1993; Morris et al., 2000). Subsequent developments in this area, including the current widespread use of X-ray crystallography to delineate the mode of binding of inhibitors and, by inference, substrates, are too extensive to permit more than a brief overview. The following two points should be borne in mind in what follows. A characteristic feature of the PNP-catalyzed reaction is the complex non-Michaelis kinetics observed with some substrates (Section 3.4). One consequence of this is that measured Ki values may be markedly dependent on the substrate (nucleoside) and its concentration range employed for following inhibition (Stoeckler, 1984; see also the next section). Moreover, it has long been a standard practice to monitor phosphorolysis in the presence of a large excess of the second substrate, Pi, usually 50 mM. The advent of phosphorylated acyclonucleoside inhibitors capable of competing simultaneously for both the nucleoside and phosphate-binding sites (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1984) demonstrated the importance of measuring Ki at lower Pi concentrations, where the inhibitor may more effectively compete with Pi for the phosphate-binding site. The low Pi concentration now routinely employed for this purpose is 1 mM, close to the intracellular Pi concentration (Traut, 1994), so that measured Ki values under these conditions may more adequately reflect the intracellular effectiveness of an inhibitor. 6.1. Classical ground-state inhibitors for low-molecular mass purine nucleoside phosphorylases It should be recalled that due to the high PNP activity in human tissues, an inhibitor must have a Ki in the nanomolar range to be considered for clinical applications, e.g., to attain 99.9% inhibition in vivo requires a 10-mM concentration of an inhibitor with a Ki of 10 nM (Stoeckler et al., 1986a). None has been approved as a drug yet, and only one (BCX-34, Section 7.3) is currently in advanced clinical trials. One of the reasons for this is that many potent inhibitors are charged molecules that do not readily penetrate cell membranes.

Fig. 17. Mechanism of catalysis for trimeric PNPs, shown here for Cellulomonas PNP, proposed by Tebbe et al. (1999). The hydrogen bond between N(1) ± H and Glu204 (Glu201 in mammalian PNPs) is the only hydrogen bond contact observed for all substrates of trimeric PNPs (cf., Fig. 13).

results in a 1000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency (Erion et al., 1997b). Asn243 is perhaps less essential, since the corresponding Asn246 in the Cellulomonas PNP interacts with the purine ring only indirectly via a water molecule (Tebbe et al., 1999), so that its role (and that of Asn243 in mammalian PNPs) may be rather recognition of 6-oxo purines as substrates than a catalytic one. Replacement of Asn243 by Asp changes the specificity of trimeric PNPs from 6-oxopurines to both 6-oxo- and 6-aminopurines. In the two recently determined three-dimensional

In an ongoing project to discover new clinically useful inhibitors, Farutin et al. (1999) have initiated a program involving creation of a database of available inhibitors, and development of QSAR models (accessible gratis on the Internet at http.//pubs.acs.org) to predict potencies of candidate inhibitors for synthesis. With 34 structurally related analogues embraced in the training set, several of which are described in Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, their Ki values versus calf spleen PNP were determined with the use of two nucleosides (Ino and MESG) as variable substrates. However, the QSAR modelling trials were not fully adequate in that although all the analogues were competitive inhibitors, the measured Ki values for several differed by as much as 10-fold between the two substrates. Such differences in Ki values for some inhibitors versus Ino and m7Guo had been reported earlier (Bzowska et al., 1991). This may be a reflection of the complexity of the PNP-catalyzed reaction (Section 3.4). It should also be noted that MESG, like m7Guo, is a pH-dependent equilibrium mixture of cationic and zwitterionic forms. It is also less stable at physiological pH than m7Guo. In the case of the latter, the cation appears to be the preferred, but not necessarily exclusive, substrate (Kulikowska et al., 1986; Bzowska et al., 1990). The foregoing investigation of Farutin et al. (1999) was subsequently extended to include an additional 24 compounds with somewhat increased structural diversity, but this time with IC50 and Ki values determined uniquely versus Ino, using the coupled assay with Xox. The resulting QSAR model derived for a total of 58 inhibitors is quite impressive (E.H. Cordes, personal communication), but it remains to assess its predictive value for more potent inhibitors. Potent inhibitors of PNPs are largely structural analogues of nucleoside substrates, embracing modifications of the base and/or pentose moiety, as well as replacement of the latter by other cyclic or acyclic moieties, frequently with attachment of a phosphate or phosphonate group to compete simultaneously with the second substrate of phosphorolysis, Pi. Inhibitors are usually competitive versus the nucleoside substrate in the phosphorolytic reaction at a fixed concentration of Pi. We now consider in turn the various structural modifications employed to develop ground-state inhibitors. 6.1.1. Base modifications Two modifications of the aglycone, 9-deaza and 8amino (or 8-hydroxy), lead to analogues with higher affinity than the parent nucleoside substrate. The first reported significant inhibitor of human erythrocyte PNP was 8-aminoguanine (8-aminoGua) and 8-aminoGuo, with Ki = 0.2 and 17 mM, respectively (Kazmers et al., 1981; Stoeckler et al., 1982). They are actually alternative substrates and not true inhibitors. However, an 8-amino substituent, when combined with other modifications described in Sections 6.1.3 and 6.1.4, leads to more potent nonsubstrate inhibitors. In at least one instance, an 8hydroxy substituent was equally effective (Fig. 18).

9-Deazanucleosides, with a C ± C glycosidic bond resistant to cleavage, are widely employed. The first reported inhibitor of the human erythrocyte enzyme (Sheen et al., 1968), albeit a weak one (Ki $ 100 mM), was a structural analogue of Ino, formycin B (9-deaza-8-aza analogue), subsequently shown to be much more potent versus E. coli PNP (Bzowska et al., 1992). Both 9-deazaGuo and 9deazaIno are good inhibitors of the human erythrocyte enzyme, to which they bind several-fold more effectively (Ki = 2.9 and 2 mM) than the parent Ino and Guo (Stoeckler et al., 1986b). As shown by X-ray crystallography, an 8-amino substituent furnishes an additional hydrogen bond to the Og of Thr242 of the mammalian enzyme (Montgomery, 1993). The same effect probably accounts for the enhanced affinity conferred by an 8-hydroxy group. With 6-keto purine nucleosides (Ino and Guo), the Nd ±H2 of Asn243 hydrogen bonds to both O6 and N(7) of the base (Section 4.4). Enhanced binding by the mammalian enzyme of 9-deazaIno and 9-deazaGuo, each with a hydrogen at N(7), is a consequence of better hydrogen bonding of O6 to the Nd ± H2 and N(7) ±H to the Od of Asn243. This rearrangement of hydrogen bonding is accompanied by a displacement of Thr242, such that its Od is no longer available as an acceptor of an 8-amino hydrogen. Hence, an 8-amino substituent, beneficial with purines, is detrimental with 9-deazapurine congeners (e.g., Montgomery et al., 1993; see Section 6.1.3 and Fig. 19). 1-b-D-Ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide (TCNR, see Fig. 18) is the only significant inhibitor of low-mm PNPs that does not have a purine-like aglycone, with Ki = 5 mM versus the human erythrocyte enzyme. Although resistant to phosphorolysis, it undergoes adenosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation (Willis et al., 1980). It is of interest that in the case of bisubstrate analogue inhibitors (Section 6.1.4), some base modifications, such as 8-aza, 7-deaza-8-aza (Beauchamp et al., 1996) or 6-aminoÏ Â and 2,6-diaminopurine (Sediva et al.,1991; Kulikowska et al., 1998; see Fig. 20) lead to improved inhibitors, whereas the same modifications in purine nucleosides do not enhance, and may even decrease, binding properties (Stoeckler, 1984; see Section 3.4). 6.1.2. Pentose ring modifications Effects of modification of the pentose ring of nucleosides on substrate/inhibitor properties were extensively reviewed by Stoeckler (1984). In general, these lead to reduced affinity for human erythrocyte PNP, with the exception of 5H-halogeno and 5H-thioalkyl congeners, which are very weak substrates, for example, 5H-deoxy-5H-iodoIno has a Ki of 18 mM, as against a Km of 12 mM, with a Vmax of 0.1% that for Ino (Stoeckler et al., 1982). For 8-amino-5Hdeoxy-5H-iodoGuo, the Ki is 3.3 mM, compared with 17 mM for 8-aminoGuo (Choi et al., 1986). Combination of a 5Hhalogeno with a noncleavable 9-deazapurine leads to more

potent inhibitors, such as 5H-deoxy-5H-iodo-formycin B, with a Ki of 7 mM as against 100 mM for formycin B, and 5Hdeoxy-5H-iodo-9-deazaIno, with a Ki of 0.18 mM as against 2.0 mM for the parent 9-deazaIno (Stoeckler et al., 1982, 1986b). This has been ascribed to favourable interaction of the 5H-iodo with His257 of the human erythrocyte enzyme (Ealick et al., 1991).

Carbocyclic nucleosides, in which the ether oxygen of the pentose ring is replaced by a methylene group, apparently have evoked little interest, perhaps because it was shown long ago that the carbocyclic analogue of Ino is not a substrate (Stoeckler, 1984). In contrast, the most significant and useful modification of the pentose ring is that in which the ether oxygen is replaced by an imino group,

leading to highly potent TS inhibitors (see Schramm, 1999; Section 6.2). It is worth noting that the affinity of free R-1-P for the human erythrocyte enzyme (Ki, 110 mM) is appreciably enhanced with its 5H-deoxy-5H-iodo analogue (Ki, 26 mM) (Choi et al., 1986). 6.1.3. Replacement of pentose ring by other cyclic or acyclic moieties Such nucleoside analogues, in which the pentose ring is replaced by an acyclic chain or some other cyclic ring, or a combination of the two, frequently with addition of a

terminal phosphate or phosphonate group, are presently the most widely investigated, and have led to some of the most potent inhibitors of low-mm PNPs, with Ki values in the nanomolar range. This class includes BCX-34 (Peldesine; see Fig. 21, Section 7.2), the only inhibitor currently reported to be in clinical trials. Acyclonucleosides, exemplified by the antiviral agents 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)Gua (Aciclovir, ACV) and 9(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)Gua (Ganciclovir, GCV), in which the pentose ring is replaced by an aliphatic chain that may mimic a portion of the pentose ring (Fig. 18), are moderate inhibitors of human erythrocyte PNP, with

Ki = 90 and 30 mM, respectively (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1984; Stein et al., 1987; Bzowska et al., 1991). Their 8-amino and 8-hydroxy analogues are more effective (Fig. 18). Even more so, although still only in the micromolar range, is another acyclonucleoside of guanine, 9-(3,4-dihydroxybutyl)Gua (DHBG) and some of its analogues (Fig. 18; Bzowska et al., 1991). No 8-amino, 8-hydroxy, or 9-deaza counterparts have been synthesized, but it is to be anticipated that these, especially the latter, may provide inhibitors with Ki values in the nanomolar range.

Inhibitors with Ki (or IC50) in the micromolar range are also obtained on replacement of the pentose ring by other cyclic rings, such as benzyl, furanylmethyl, and thienylmethyl (Fig. 19). It was shown long ago that 9-p-aminobenzylHx has a low affinity for human erythrocyte PNP in the presence of 50 mM Pi (Ki = 200 mM), a property profited from to purify the enzyme by affinity chromatography (Osborne, 1980; see Section 8.1). In contrast, 9-benzylGua (see Fig. 19) has a Ki of 7 mM at 1 mM Pi (Kelley et al., 1993), while 9-(2-thienylmethyl)Gua and 9-(2-furanylmethyl)Gua have IC50 values of 11 and 18 mM, respectively, at 50 mM Pi (Sircar & Gilbertsen, 1988). The 8-amino analogues of the latter, that is, 8-amino-9-(2-thienylmethyl)Gua and 8-amino-9-(2-furanylmethyl)Gua, exhibited IC50 values of 0.17 and 0.25 mM, respectively (Gilbertsen et al., 1987; Sircar et al., 1987), whereas their 9-deaza analogues were less effective, with IC50 1.0 and 5.4 mM, respectively (Sircar et al., 1992). Similarly, 9-deaza-9-(3-thienylmethyl)Gua (see Fig. 19) is 10-fold more effective than its 8-amino congener (Ki = 80 and 830 nM, respectively) (Gilbertsen et al., 1992). The reason for these differences between 9-deaza and 8-amino-9-deaza analogues is described in Section 6.1.1. Further studies (see Fig. 22) included 9-arylmethyl (Montgomery et al., 1993), 9-alicyclic and 9-heteroalicyclic (Secrist et al., 1993) analogues of 9-deazaGua, as well as additionally modified 9-arylmethyl-9-deazaguanines (Erion et al., 1993). With calf spleen PNP, the most potent was the (S)-enantiomer of 9-deaza-9-[1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-carboxyethyl]Gua, with an IC50 of 6 nM at 1 mM Pi. Among the nonionic inhibitors in the foregoing series, the most potent were 9-[1-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-cyanoethyl]-9-deazaGua and 9-(2-tetrahydrothienylmethyl)-9-deazaGua, with an IC50 of 11 nM at 1 mM Pi. For other derivatives, the IC50 values were 20 ± 30 nM at 1 mM Pi. For most of them, the IC50 was dependent on the Pi concentration, the ratio of IC50 at 50 mM Pi to that at 1 mM Pi ranging from 1 to 940 (Fig. 22), implying that some may be bisubstrate analogue inhibitors (see the next section). In fact, X-ray crystallography demonstrated that several had groups located near the phosphate-binding site; while one member, 9-[1-(3-chlorophenyl-2-cyanoethyl)]-9deazaGua, was found to be competitive versus Pi, with a Ki of 5 nM (Erion et al., 1993). Finally, attention should be directed to 9-(3-pyridinylmethyl)-9-deazaGua (Peldesine, BCX-34; see Fig. 21), the sole inhibitor currently reported to be in clinical trials (Section 7.3), with an IC50 versus the erythrocytic enzyme from humans, rats, and mice in the nanomolar range (Bantia et al., 1996). Ki values for related analogues, 9-(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9-deazaGua and 9-(4-chloro-3-pyridinylmethyl)-9deazaGua, are reported as 25 and 67 nM, respectively, versus Ino as variable substrate, at 1 mM Pi (Farutin et al., 1999). BCX-34 is a potential candidate for treatment of human Tcell proliferative disorders (Bantia et al., 1996). Recently, the synthesis and inhibitory activity versus human erythrocyte PNP were reported for a novel class of PNP inhibitors, with a pentose ring replaced by another

cyclic moiety and linked to the 9-deazaHx or 9-deazaGua by a heteroatom instead of the methylene linker (Morris et al., 2000; see Fig. 21). Many analogues in this series have IC50s in the nanomolar range. Derivatives with Gua as an aglycone were generally better inhibitors than their corresponding counterparts with Hx. 6.1.4. Bisubstrate analogue inhibitors An interesting extension of the various cyclo- and acyclonucleoside inhibitors described in the previous section is that in which the cyclic moiety or the acyclic chain carries a terminal phosphate or phosphonate capable of interacting with the phosphate-binding site of the enzyme. The resulting cyclo- or acyclonucleotide may then conceivably interact simultaneously with the nucleoside (base and pentose moieties)- and phosphate-binding sites, thus behaving as a bisubstrate analogue inhibitor, first demonstrated with the antiviral agents ACV and GCV, both only moderate inhibitors of mammalian PNP (Tuttle & Krenitsky, 1984; Stein et al., 1987; Bzowska et al., 1991). In herpes virusinfected cells, each of these is initially phosphorylated by the viral thymidine kinase (TK), and subsequently by cellular kinases to the triphosphates (TPs), which preferentially inhibit the viral polymerases. GCV, with two terminal hydroxyls in the acyclic chain, is prochiral, and phosphorylation leads to formation of two enantiomers, (R) and (S).

The viral kinase is stereospecific and gives only the (S)enantiomer (see Shugar, 1999). It initially was shown by Tuttle and Krenitsky (1984) that in the presence of 50 mM Pi, the MPs and TPs of ACV are better inhibitors of mammalian PNP than the parent ACV. Much more potent was the diphosphate. Most striking, however, was the observation that reduction of the Pi concentration to 1 mM led to a dramatic decrease in Ki for the diphosphate to a value of 9 nM. Similar results were reported for the (S)-enantiomer of GCV diphosphate, with the chemically synthesized (R)-enantiomer half as effective (Stein et al., 1987). This is consistent with ACV and GCV diphosphates behaving as bisubstrate analogue inhibitors in which the acyclic chain length (spacer) between the base and the terminal phosphate corresponds to the distance between the base- and phosphate-binding sites in the enzyme, further corroborated by Krenitsky et al. (1990). As expected for a bisubstrate analogue inhibitor (see Broom, 1989), X-ray crystallography of a complex of ACV diphosphate with human erythrocyte PNP demonstrated directly that the guanine and terminal phosphate of the inhibitor bound to both the base- and phosphate-binding sites of the enzyme (Ealick et al., 1991). Furthermore, other structurally related inhibitors were shown to exhibit competitive inhibition versus both the base moiety and phosphate as variable substrate (Kelley et al., 1995).

Fig. 22. Inhibition of calf spleen PNP by analogues of 9-deazaGuo, with the pentose ring replaced by other cyclic moieties, in the presence of 50 mM or 1 mM Pi, as indicated. IC50 values are from Montgomery et al. (1993) for 9-arylmethyl derivatives, Erion et al. (1993) for 9-arylmethyl derivatives substituted on the methylene spaces, and Secrist et al. (1993) for 9-alicyclic and 9-heteroalicyclic derivatives. Ki values versus Ino are from Farutin et al. (1999).

Unfortunately, both ACV and GCV diphosphates, because of their high negative charge, exhibit poor cellular permeability. They also have short plasma lifetimes, due to susceptibility to phosphatases. Hence, they are not promising candidates as in vivo inhibitors. This has stimulated the synthesis of mimics of ACV diphosphate, with the acyclic chain oxygens replaced by methylene groups (see Kelley et al., 1995) and the terminal phosphate by phosphonate. Each of these modifications confers metabolic stability. Moreover, some such phosphonates appear capable of slowly traversing the cell membrane, conceivably via an endocytosis-like process (Naesens et al., 1997; De Clercq et al., 1999).

Acyclonucleoside monophosphonates (Fig. 20), originally prepared as potential antiviral and antitumour agents, subsequently were found to be moderate inhibitors of PNP, such as ACV ±MP, with Ki values in the micromolar range Ï Â at 1 mM Pi (Kulikowska et al., 1998; Sediva et al., 1991; A. Bzowska et al., in preparation). Intracellularly, these are phosphorylated by cellular kinases to their phosphates and diphosphates (De Clercq et al., 1999), which are actually analogues of acyclonucleoside diphosphates and TPs, respectively, with the a-phosphate replaced by phosphonate. The MP of 9-(S)-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)guanine, which differs from the (S)-enantiomer of GCV diphosphate (see above; Fig. 20) only in that the a-phos-

phate is replaced by phosphonate, inhibits PNP from Ï Â L12210 cells with Ki = 18 nM at 1 mM Pi (Sediva et al., 1991), as compared with 9 nM for (S)-GCV diphosphate with the human erythrocyte enzyme (see above). Surprisingly, and in contrast to ACV and GCV diphosphates (Stein et al., 1987), replacement of the guanine ring by a 6-aminopurine (adenine, 2,6-diaminopurine) only minimally affected inhibitory potency of these acyclonucleoside monophosphonates and their phosphates (see Fig. 20). In addition, several analogues with 8-azaGua or 7deaza-8-azaGua as aglycons likewise exhibited Ki values in the nanomolar range at 1 mM Pi (Beauchamp et al., 1996; see Fig. 23). It is of interest that these phosphonate analogues are only very feeble inhibitors of the high-mm E. coli enzyme (Kulikowska et al., 1998; A. Bzowska et al., in preparation). Phosphate mimics other than phosphonates (Fig. 23) have also been examined for their ability to interact with the phosphate-binding site (Guida et al., 1994). Two of these, sulphate and carboxylate, both highly ionic, interacted significantly, and X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the sulphate binds much like phosphate, but the sulphate analogue was only one-fourth as effective as an inhibitor. The use of metabolically stable phosphonate analogues has now become widespread. However, it is worth recalling that several of the acyclonucleoside analogue inhibitors described in the previous section, with no terminal phosphate or phosphonate, in particular 9-[l-(3-chlorophenyl-2-cyanoethyl)]-9-deazaGua, effectively competed with Pi, with a Ki of 5 nM (Erion et al., 1993). Bearing in mind that these are uncharged molecules, they may be more effective inhibitors in vivo. An interesting innovation was introduced by Halazy et al. (1991), based on an earlier report by Nakamura et al. (1989) that the metabolically stable 9-(5-phosphonopentyl)guanine (Fig. 18) has a Ki of 170 nM. Following a suggestion, derived from electronic and steric considerations, that a-fluoro and a,a-difluoro alkanephosphonates should mimic phosphate esters better than the corresponding phosphonates, Halazy et al. (1991) prepared the corresponding 9-(5,5-difluoro-5-phosphonopentyl)Gua (Fig. 18), which proved to be a competitive inhibitor versus Ino with PNP from human and rat erythrocytes, calf spleen, and E. coli (but see the next paragraph). Moreover, its K i decreased dramatically, 20- to 40-fold, when the Pi concentration was reduced from 50 to 1 mM, consistent with its being a bisubstrate analogue inhibitor. At 1 mM Pi, the Ki for the 4 enzymes was in the range 15± 35 nM at pH 7.4. With the human erythrocyte enzyme, the Ki was further reduced to 4 nM at pH 6.2, but increased above pH 8 for all 4 enzymes. The origin of these effects at acid pH is not clear, but at pH ! 8, it is probably related to formation of the monoanion of the guanine base (pKa $ 9.2). The presumed E. coli PNP referred to by Halazy et al. (1991) was of commercial origin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), listed as ``bacterial PNP.'' We have elsewhere shown,

with the aid of inhibitors specific for the E. coli enzyme, that the Sigma bacterial PNP is not from E. coli (Bzowska et al., 1992), but probably a product of TOYOBO (Tokyo, Japan), and its source is likely a species of Cellulomonas, with properties differing from the enzymes from other sources (Section 3). Other laboratories have also employed the Sigma ``bacterial'' PNP without being aware that its source is not E. coli. Bearing in mind the striking differences in properties between the low-mm trimeric class of PNPs (including Cellulomonas PNP) and the high-mm hexameric E. coli enzyme, it obviously would be rewarding to examine the response of the latter to 9-(5,5-difluoro-5-phosphonopentyl)Gua (Halazy et al., 1991). This compound, recently synthesized independently (Yokomatsu et al., 1997), was found to be totally inactive versus the E. coli enzyme (T. Yokomatsu, E. Kulikowska, & D. Shugar, unpublished), and is under further investigation. Consequently, it is of interest to note that in the crystal structure of the ternary complex of E. coli PNP with formycin B and phosphate (sulphate), the calculated closest distance between the base ring C(9) and a phosphate (sulphate) oxygen, that is, C(9) ± O, is 5.64, 5.36, Ê and 5.15 A for monomers A, B, and C, respectively. The Ê closest distances for C(1H)± O are 3.40, 3.10, and 3.40 A. For the ternary complex of calf PNP with Ino and sulphate, the Ê corresponding distances are significantly longer, 5.93 A for Ê for C(1H) ± O. N(9)± O and 4.08 A Subsequently, Halazy et al. (1995) prepared a series of fluorophosphonate derivatives of 9-benzylGua. Three members of this series (Fig. 19) proved to be among the most potent known ground-state PNP inhibitors, with Ki values versus the human erythrocyte enzyme in the range 1.3 ± 3.2 nM at 1 mM Pi. The effectiveness of the simple difluorophosphonate derivative of Halazy et al. (1991) led Yokomatsu et al. (1997, 1998) to prepare another series in which the n-butyl spacer was replaced with structurally rigid linkers or a cyclopropane ring, and the guanine by hypoxanthine (Figs. 18 and 19). When tested versus PNP from human erythrocyte and Cellulomonas at the same pH, 7.5, employed by Halazy et al. (1991), two of them, in which the spacer included the cyclopropane ring, were found to be most potent (see Fig. 19) and exhibited Ki values of 5 and 9 nM versus the Cellulomonas, and 23 and 17 mM versus the human erythrocyte, enzymes at 100 mM Pi, mistakenly referred to in the text as 100 nM Pi (see Yokomatsu et al., 1999). Surprisingly, inhibition of phosphorolysis appeared to be noncompetitive, presumably versus Ino. This was then extended (Yokomatsu et al., 1999) to the synthesis of Ino analogues bearing the cis and trans isomers of the a,adifluorophosphonate-functionalized tetrahydrofuranyl moiety, hence structurally related to the fluorophosphonate derivatives of 9-benzylGua of Halazy et al. (1995) referred to in the preceding paragraph. At 100 mM Pi, both isomers were equally potent against the Cellulomonas enzyme, with an IC50 = 35 nM; whereas, with the human erythrocyte enzyme, the cis isomer, with a Ki of 90 nM, was 4 -fold

more effective than the trans. It would be extremely interesting to measure the inhibition constants for all the foregoing at low Pi concentrations. A rather unusual example of a PNP inhibitor that appears to behave like a bisubstrate analogue inhibitor is an 8-aminoquinazoline derivative (Fig. 24). Dempcy and Skibo (1991a, 1991b) found that quinazolines are good lead compounds for design of both irreversible and reversible inhibitors of human erythrocyte PNP. Among the reversible inhibitors, the most interesting were quinazolinone (Ki, 323 mM at 50 mM Pi) and its 8-amino congener (Ki , 13 mM at 50 mM Pi), both competitive versus Ino. The higher affinity of the enzyme for the latter, comparable with that for Hx (Ki, 17 mM for phosphorolysis of Guo), suggests that the 8-amino group interacts with the attacking phosphate. In fact, whereas the Ki of quinazolinone was independent of the concentration of Pi, that for 8-aminoquinazolinone varied from 80 mM at 200 mM Pi to 10 mM at 5 mM Pi. This is clearly deserving of further investigation. It would be of interest to examine the behaviour of the 9-amino derivatives of Gua, Hx, and Ade, as well as of their 9-deaza analogues.

Other quinazoline-based inhibitors (Dempcy & Skibo, 1991a, 1991b) irreversibly inactivate human erythrocyte PNP, probably by reductive addition and cross-linking of Glu201 and Glu259, both of which are active site residues (see Table 6). 6.1.5. Purine N(3)- and N(7)-substituted analogues Bearing in mind that 3-b-Ado and 3-b-Ino (Bzowska et al., 1996), and 7-b-Guo and 7-b-Ino (Bzowska et al., 1994) are substrates, albeit in most instances, weak ones, it is conceivable that N(3)- and N(7)-substituted purine analogues may be useful lead compounds for new inhibitors. Woo et al. (1992) prepared a broad range of analogues with benzyl, thienylmethyl, and furanylmethyl substituents at N(3) of Gua, Hx, and their 8-amino congeners, but these exhibited in general lower affinities than their N(9) counterparts for the human erythrocyte enzyme (see Fig. 25). An N(7)-acycloguanosine was found to be a 4 -fold better inhibitor than its N(9) congener versus the human erythrocyte enzyme (Bzowska et al., 1994), but not with the enzymes from calf spleen and Cellulomonas (Bzowska

et al., 1995a; Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998). It may be useful to develop such analogues with an adenine ring and with a phosphate or phosphonate moiety, as such, or with a suitable linker to mimic a bisubstrate analogue (see Ï Luic et al., 2001). 6.2. Transition state inhibitors Undoubtedly, the most significant development leading to rational design of potent inhibitors of mammalian PNPs is forthcoming from the extensive studies of Schramm and coworkers (Kline & Schramm, 1993; Miles et al., 1998; see Schramm, 1999) on the TS in the phosphorolysis reaction of

Ino. The reverse, synthetic reaction was eliminated by replacement of phosphate by arsenate; the product of arsenolysis, a- D -ribose-1-arsenate, chemically highly unstable, prevents the reverse reaction. Analysis of kinetic isotope effects for the reaction led to establishment of the TS of the nucleoside substrate as one with a positively charged ribooxocarbenium ion, and protonation of the purine leaving group at N(7). Attack by the arsenate (phosphate) anion, Ê located 3 A from C(1H), hence not bonded, lags far behind bond breakage to the purine ring (Fig. 15, lower panel; but see Section 5). These features were then incorporated into noncleavable analogues, immucillins H and G, in which the purine rings were replaced by 9-deazaHx and 9-deazaGua, respectively, with a proton at N(7) and the ribooxocarbenium ion by a positively charged iminoribitol moiety with a pKa $ 6.5 (Evans et al., 2000). The resulting immucillins H and G (see Fig. 15, lower panel) were found to be slow-onset, slow-release, tightbinding inhibitors of the calf spleen and human erythrocyte enzymes. Their interaction with the enzyme proceeds via a two-step mechanism in which the inhibitor I initially binds to form a reversible complex EÁI with a Ki in the nanomolar range. This is followed by a slow conformational rearrangement, leading to a more tightly bound enzyme-inhibitor complex E * ÁI. The equilibrium dissociation constants Ki* ranged from 23 to 72 pM for both enzymes and both immucillins. The geometric and electrostatic similarity of immucillin H to the TS is 0.723, as compared with 0.483 for Ino, thus accounting for binding of the TS inhibitor 7 Â 105fold more tightly than the substrate. Furthermore, one-thirdthe-sites inhibition is observed, that is, complete inhibition

occurs with one mole inhibitor per mole of enzyme trimer. It follows that binding of one mole inhibitor per trimer hinders binding to the other two monomers. However, in a crystal structure of an immucillin with calf spleen PNP (PDB entries 1B8O and 1B8N), three molecules of inhibitor per trimer were found, probably due to the much higher concentration of inhibitor required to obtain the crystal complex

(see also Section 3.4.5). It would be interesting to obtain suitable crystals of the complex of the enzyme with one bound inhibitor molecule. In the foregoing proposed mechanism, it is not immediately apparent whether the immucillins bind with the N(7) protonated (pKa > 8.5), as suggested by the elevated pKa of the TS. It is somewhat at variance with the fact that

Data for neutral forms of formycins (top panel) are from Bzowska et al. (1992), and for the other compounds, from Bzowska et al. (1998a, 1999). Note that 6methylformycin is numbered according to IUPAC nomenclature. In the text, it is referred to as 1-methylformycin to facilitate comparison with 1methyladenosine. Note also that the formycins exist in different tautomeric forms, which bind preferentially to the enzyme (Bzowska et al., 1992; Kierdaszuk et al., 2000; see Section 4.5.3).

the X-ray crystal structure of a complex shows the presence of Asn243 in the vicinity of N(7). In addition, it should not be overlooked that the positively charged 7methylGuo and 7-methylIno are excellent substrates of the mammalian enzymes. The extremely slow rate of dissociation of the enzyme ± immucillin complexes, t1/2 $ 5 hr, points to favourable pharmacological properties (Miles et al., 1998). However, bearing in mind that the immucillins are charged molecules, it remains to establish their ability to traverse cell membranes. 6.3. Inhibitors of high-molecular mass (Escherichia coli) purine nucleoside phosphorylase Surprisingly, relatively little attention has been devoted to inhibitors of the high-mm phosphorylases, the best characterized of which is that from E. coli. Nucleoside analogues that are selective inhibitors of E. coli PNP have been identified, some with Ki values 2 mM (Bzowska et al., 1992, 1998a, 1999; see Fig. 26), as against values of Ï Â $ 350 mM for Ino and Ado (Doskocil & Holy, 1977). These include 8-aza-9-deaza (formycins A and B) and 7deaza analogues, resistant to phosphorolysis. Their selectivity is associated with differences in structural requirements for ligands, in that the presence of a substituent at C(6) other than keto, and lack of a hydrogen at N(1) (Fig. 26), precludes (with some known exceptions, see Fig. 20) high affinity for the low-mm enzymes. Unexpectedly, the 6-keto analogue, formycin B, the first identified inhibitor of human erythrocyte PNP (Sheen et al., 1968), shows a Ki of 100 mM as against 5 mM with the E. coli PNP (Bzowska et al., 1992). In the case of the formycins shown in Fig. 26, enhanced affinity for the E. coli enzyme, relative to that of purine nucleosides, has been associated with the presence of an additional hydrogen bond between N(8) and the Og of Ser90 (Koellner et al., 1998). It should be noted, however, that formycins A and B each exists as an equilibrium mixture of two tautomeric forms, N(7) ± H and N(8)± H (see Wierzchowski & Shugar, 1982), whereas the N(1)± methylformycin A is a mixture of additional tautomeric species (Wierzchowski & Shugar, 1993). A study of the inhibitory properties of various N-methyl formycin analogues indeed did point to preferential binding of a given tautomeric species (Bzowska et al., 1992). A more recent investigation, profiting from the known fluorescence emission properties of the various tautomeric species of formycin A and its N(1)-methyl derivative, led to identification of the tautomeric form(s) selectively bound by the enzyme (Kierdaszuk et al., 2000). Other nucleoside analogues shown in Fig. 26, with a chlorine at C(2) or C(6) of the purine base or with a planar hydrophobic group linked at C(7) by a flexible spacer, may bind more favourably via p ±p interactions of their bases with Phe159 and Tyr160, as shown for

interaction of E. coli PNP with purine bases in the solid state (Koellner et al., 1998). The two purine base analogue inhibitors shown in Fig. 26 inhibit the E. coli enzyme, with Ki values of $ 1 mM or lower. Both carry a chlorine at C(2) and a planar hydrophobic group at C(6) linked to the purine ring, as with 7-deazapurine inhibitors, by a flexible spacer. They were found to bind to the enzyme in the presence of Pi to form a ternary ``dead-end'' complex, PNP/base/Pi. Existence of a binary complex, while conceivable, has not been observed. They are not, however, true inhibitors, since they are substrates in the reverse synthetic reaction (Bzowska et al., 1999). Attention should be drawn to the fact that some acyclonucleoside phosphonates (Fig. 20) at best only feebly inhibit the bacterial enzyme (Bzowska et al., 1990; Kulikowska et al., 1998). One of these, (S)-9-(2phosphonylmethoxy)propyladenine, studied in more detail, was found to inhibit the E. coli enzyme competitively versus both nucleoside substrate and Pi, as expected for a bisubstrate analogue inhibitor, but with a Ki versus nucleoside substrate of 400 mM, as compared with 4 mM for the calf spleen enzyme, both in the presence of 1 mM Pi (A. Bzowska et al., in preparation). 7. Clinical aspects 7.1. Therapy of purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency Symptoms of this disease include, among others, recurrent otitis and sinus infections, urinary tract infections, pneumonias, diarrhea, and pharyngitis. Neurologic abnormalities, occasionally manifested even prior to the immunodeficiency state, have been noted in 50% of patients. The simultaneous occurrence of immunodeficiency and neurological disorders strongly supports diagnosis of PNP deficiency (Giblett, 1985; Kredich & Hershfield, 1989; Markert, 1991; Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995). Diagnosis is based on the absence, or very low levels, of enzyme activity in a hemolyzate of the patient's erythrocytes, and is further supported by other criteria, such as low plasma and urinary levels of urate. Prenatal diagnosis may be performed by measurements of the level of enzyme in cultured amniotic cells or chorionic villi (Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995). Obligate heterozygotes exhibit normal immune function and usually $ 50% of the normal level of erythrocyte PNP activity, but levels even as low as 1.5% are sufficient for survival. In homozygotes, the function of T-cells may be normal at birth, but decreases with age, or fluctuates with time. In some patients, the function of B-cells may be somewhat abnormal. About 30% of patients develop autoimmune disease, and no untreated homozygotic individual survives to adulthood. Three approaches to therapy of PNP deficiency have been proposed hitherto.

7.1.1. Bone marrow transplantation Bone marrow transplantation from a histocompatible donor is still considered the only effective therapy for children with SCID and other primary T-cell defects (Fischer et al., 1994; Buckley, 1995). Unfortunately, human leukocyte antigen-identical donors are rarely available. A number of initial transplantations worldwide, in several instances with human leukocyte antigen-identical marrow donors, proved fatal, largely as a result of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or post-operative infections (Markert, 1991; Buckley, 1995). Broome et al. (1996) in the United States and Carpenter et al. (1996) in Australia independently reported the first successful transplantations of allogeneic bone marrow from heterozygous siblings. The two patients, 5and 6-year-old children (one diagnosed late), have been long-term survivors, with correction of both lymphocyte metabolic and functional abnormalities. At a recent conference, additional cases of successful transplantations were listed by Hallett et al. (1999), who also reported a successful unrelated donor transplant, the first of its kind, on a patient 4 years of age. Four years after the transplant, the patient shows full donor chimaerism and complete immune reconstitution, but no reversal, albeit no further deterioration, of neurological abnormalities. We have learned, through personal contacts, of more cases, not yet reported, for which prognosis, following transplantation, appears promising. 7.1.2. Enzyme replacement therapy First exploited for treatment of ADA deficiency, the first known cause of SCID, enzyme replacement therapy initially consisted of multiple transfusions of normal donor erythrocytes, previously irradiated to reduce risk of GVHD. Notwithstanding reports of transient improvements in immune function, negative factors were inefficient cellular uptake, rapid elimination of the enzyme from the blood of patients, and potential immunogenicity (see Kredich & Hershfield, 1989). Efforts to circumvent these problems eventually led to the use of purified enzyme, chemically modified by covalent coupling of inert polyethyleneglycol (PEG) to the e-amino group of lysine residues. This results in some ``masking'' of epitopes, with resultant marked reduction of immunogenicity, as well as prolongation of the circulating lifetime of the enzyme. The modified enzyme is well tolerated, with no observed toxic or allergic reactions (Hershfield, 1998). In the case of ADA deficiency, the benefits of PEG-ADA therapy proved sufficiently promising (Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995) and received approval of the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1990. However, despite its safety and efficacy, it has proven inordinately expensive (Hershfield, 1998). In the case of PNP deficiency, initial results of red blood cell transfusions in four patients, with limited improvement in two of them, pointed to the utility of its further

development with the use of the polyethylene glycolmodified enzyme PEG-PNP (see Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995). Both human erythrocyte and bovine PNPs, however, were considered too unstable at 37°C for therapeutic purposes. Consequently, attention was directed by Hershfield et al. (1991) to the use of the much more stable hexameric PNP from E. coli. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to replace three Arg residues in each of the six subunits by Lys, so that the mutant hexameric enzyme was capable of binding 18 additional molecules of PEG. As anticipated, this resulted in substantially reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity in mice, relative to wild-type PEG-PNP, with full retention of enzymatic activity, and a plasma half-life 24-fold longer than that of unmodified PNP. This objective was achieved at a time when the three-dimensional structure, and the location of the active site, of E. coli PNP were unknown. The choice of the Arg residues to be modified was based on the amino acid sequence and secondary structure analysis to predict regions of solvent accessibility. The Arg thus selected for substitution by Lys were at positions 38, 136, and 208 and, as is now clear from the threedimensional structure of the enzyme (Section 4.5), the choice was a good one, inasmuch as none of them constitute the active site of the enzyme. As pointed out by the authors, the ability of the E. coli enzyme to phosphorolyse Ado may conceivably permit its use in treatment of ADA deficiency, in addition to PNP deficiency. 7.1.3. Somatic cell gene therapy The principle of introducing corrective genes into the cell genome is theoretically sound and highly attractive. However, the technical hurdles to be surmounted, albeit well recognized, remain formidable and are currently the subject of numerous commentaries, reviews, and official guidelines (Verma & Somia, 1997; Amado & Chen, 1999; Buckley, 2000; Mountain, 2000; Zallen, 2000). As pointed out in a recent comprehensive review (Mountain, 2000), the past (and first) decade of clinical experience, involving more than 3500 patients, most in Phase I/II studies aimed largely at assessing efficiency of gene transfer and problems of safety, albeit in some instances highly encouraging, has overall been modest and disappointing. Nonetheless, the field of gene therapy is undergoing steady progress, and important advances are to be anticipated in the foreseeable future. Three types of gene delivery systems are presently employed: viral and nonviral vectors and physical methods, with the viral vectors being the most effective. The positive features and disadvantages of the different systems, as applied to various diseases, are described by Mountain (2000). As in the case of the more widespread ADA deficiency (Greenberg & Riddell, 1999), PNP deficiency is considered a good candidate for gene therapy, inasmuch as its symptoms are largely limited to the lymphohematopoietic system, with lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem cells as

402

the target sites for PNP gene transfer (Kredich & Hershfield, 1989; Hershfield & Mitchell, 1995). The hematopoietic stem cell is an especially good target because of its capacity to self-renew and differentiate into all the mature cells of the blood and immune system (Amado & Chen, 1999). At the moment, however, the academic research community must await formulation of National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) guidelines for the ethical and legal use of stem cells in research in this field (Editorial, 2000). Human PNP activity has been expressed in low yield in cell lines transformed with plasmid vectors, and in better yield with retroviral vectors, in murine bone marrow cells (McIvor et al., 1985, 1987; see Kredich & Hershfield, 1989). Fibroblasts from PNP-deficient patients have also been employed as a model target system for retroviralmediated PNP gene transfer, with relatively high levels of expression (Osborne & Miller, 1988). To determine the effectiveness of retroviral-mediated gene transfer and expression for metabolic correction of PNP deficiency, Foresman et al. (1992) employed as a model target the PNP-deficient dGuo-sensitive NSU-1 subline of murine S49 T-lymphoma cells. These were transduced with recombinant retrovirus, expressing either murine or human erythrocyte PNP sequences under transcriptional regulation of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, with substantial expression of PNP activity and metabolic correction of the sensitivity of the cells to dGuo, resulting in near wild-type levels of growth inhibition. Retroviral vectors used by Nelson et al. (1995) to transduce murine PNP cDNA to both normal and PNP-deficient human peripheral blood lymphocytes, led to elevated PNP activity and partial correction of mitogenic and allogeneic responses in the transduced PNP-deficient cells. Jonsson et al. (1992) prepared abbreviated human erythrocyte PNP genes to determine the effect of introns on gene expression, and found that an intronless PNP minigene construct led to undetectable enzyme activity. The same authors (Jonsson et al., 1995) subsequently reported the construction, and tests, of retroviral vectors containing abbreviated PNP genes in the reverse orientation, a strategy compatible with transduction of intron-containing genes. Directed mutagenesis of sequences preventing intact retroviral transduction provided a 2.9-kb PNP gene that was transduced intact in a high percentage of clones after two rounds of replication from primary virus producer clones. The foregoing clearly points to the potential of viral-mediated gene transfer in therapy of PNP deficiency. Promising as the foregoing may be, it, however, cannot be too strongly stressed that apart from the need for more efficient and safe vectors, what is ultimately required is replacement of a defective gene by its functional counterpart located at its normal position on the chromosome, so as to eliminate concerns about the number of genes delivered, their chromosomal location(s), and, consequently, regulation of their expression. Homologous recom-

bination hitherto has proven too inefficient for achievement of this goal. However, a latecomer to this field holds out some promise. An alternative, only recently proposed, strategy directs attention to in situ repair of the defective gene in an afflicted individual, profiting from the presence of the numerous DNA repair enzymes in cells (Kmiec, 1999a, 1999b). Such an approach is much more attractive, and perhaps more realistic, although presently limited to those instances where the gene defect is a small one, for example, the single base change in the b-globin gene responsible for sickle-cell anemia. This would equally apply to those cases of PNP deficiency resulting from single point mutations, such as, Arg234Pro (see Table 1), which is the one most frequently encountered (Markert et al., 1997). The principle is to synthesize a short oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to the section of the defective gene containing the error, except for the site corresponding to the error, at which the oligomer contains the nucleotide complementary to that in the normal, nondefective gene. The oligomer, shuttled to cells with the aid of liposomes, binds to its complementary sequence in the defective gene, with formation of a bulge at the site of mismatch. This would be recognized, and the incorrect nucleotide forming the bulge removed, followed by insertion of the correct nucleotide by the endogenous DNA repair enzyme(s). Since mammalian cells contain enzymes that destabilize or degrade the termini of DNA molecules, the stability of the oligomer is increased by attachment to its termini of short segments of RNA complementary to the regions of the defective gene flanking the DNA oligomer. Such chimeric RNA ±DNA oligonucleotides are also known to be more effective in homologous pairing reactions in vitro than the corresponding DNA duplexes. Several gene defects have now been successfully corrected in vitro by this procedure, the first being, in fact, the sickle-cell mutation (Cole-Strauss et al., 1996). Even more impressive is the demonstration by Alexeev and Yoon (1998) of repair of the homozygous point mutation TGT 3 TCT (Cys 3 Ser) in the tyrosinase gene of melanocytes from albino mice, resulting in restoration of tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis, further shown by clonal analysis to be permanent and stable over several generations at the levels of genome sequence and protein and phenotypic change. Some successes have been reported in application of the foregoing to animal trials (Gura, 1999; Kmiec, 1999a, 1999b). Encouraging results have also been obtained with Gunn rats, which model Crigler ± Najjar disease, in which patients are unable to metabolize bilirubin. Single-base deletions in such rats have been corrected by an appropriate chimera in up to 40% of the liver cells of treated animals, with concomitant restoration of normal enzyme activity (see Gura, 1999). It now appears logical to apply this approach to correction of point mutations responsible for PNP deficiency.

It is also of obvious interest to identify the repair enzyme(s) responsible for recognition and correction of the point mutations leading to the gene defects. Mismatch repair has been invoked, and it is possible that base-excision enzymes, so-called DNA glycosylases, for example, uracilDNA glycosylase, are involved. Specific inhibitors of some of these glycosylases are now known (Scharer & Verdine, È 1995), and undoubtedly would be helpful in the elucidation of the nature of the repair mechanism. 7.2. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase levels in pathological states The level of PNP activity has been widely investigated as a possible marker in various pathological states, among which PNP deficiency is the best-known example. Milder clinical presentations of PNP (and ADA) deficiency are similar to common variable immunodeficiency, a primary immunodeficiency disease, but studies of patients with common variable immunodeficiency failed to identify individuals with deficiencies of these enzymes (Fleischman et al., 1998). Abnormalities of some enzyme levels, including PNP, in the purine pathway have been noted in leukemic cells and malignant lymphoid tissues (see Morisaki et al., 1986), and it was proposed long ago that biochemical heterogeneity of acute lymphoblastic leukemia may furnish a basis for selective chemotherapy (Poplack et al., 1981). In various types of leukemia and lymphoma, PNP levels were lower, and ADA/PNP ratios significantly higher, relative to normal Â Ï Â cells (Mesarosova et al., 1993, 1995a). The ADA/PNP ratio appears to be a reflection of clinical severity (Patmasiriwat et al., 1993) and to discriminate between myeloid and Â monocytoid subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (MesaroÏ Â sova et al., 1993) and various types of leukemias and Â Ï Â lymphomas (Blatt et al., 1982; Mesarosova et al., 1995a, Â Ï 1995b). Babusikova et al. (1990) found that PNP may be an additional useful marker for distinguishing prolymphocytic from lymphocytic leukemia, as well as for early detection of prolymphocytoid transformation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The same authors have described a characteristic pattern of ADA and PNP levels for diagnostic confirmation of hairy cell leukemia. The ADA and PNP levels in a biopsy specimen are also considered a useful adjunct to the histologic diagnosis of oral non-Hodgkin lymphomas (Maeda et al., 1992). No significant differences in kinetic properties were noted between the PNPs isolated from lung and kidney tumours and those from the corresponding normal tissues (Bzowska et al., 1995b). Nor have any differences in various properties been observed between the enzymes from leukemic and normal mononuclear cells, the inference being that the lower levels in the former are the result of a decreased rate of PNP synthesis (Morisaki et al., 1986). On the other hand, the significant enhancement of PNP, as well as ADA and HGPRT, activities in human colon tumour

tissues appears to be related to the degree of tumour invasiveness (Sanfilippo et al., 1994). PNP activity has been proposed as a specific marker for hepatic endothelial cell injury (Rao et al., 1990, 1991; Mischinger et al., 1991), the limiting factor in liver preservation and hepatic function, based on the appreciably higher level of enzyme activity in the endothelial cells, as compared with parenchymal cells, of the liver, heart, and kidney (Rubio & Berne, 1980). It has been noted that hepatic endothelial cells are more susceptible to injury than parenchymal cells in the liver exposed to short-term ischemia and subsequent reperfusion (see Nakagami et al., 1996). In addition, monitoring of PNP release into the circulation from perfused liver has been employed as one of the more important indicators of liver endothelial cell injury and hepatic function in experimental and clinical surgery. An even better correlation was noted between PNP release from incubated hepatocytes and cell injury (Brass & Mody, 1995; Ohya et al., 1998). Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage levels of PNP have been employed to evaluate pulmonary endothelial cell function during monitoring of acute graft rejection in lung transplantation (Rao et al., 1994). Levels of PNP have been studied in peripheral blood lymphocytes and erythrocytes from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with somewhat varying findings, due to use of different cell lines. However, there is no real evidence for an association of PNP deficiency with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Murray et al., 1985; Renouf et al., 1989). 7.3. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase as a target enzyme in chemotherapy 7.3.1. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents Identification of the first PNP-deficient patient by Giblett et al. (1975) has stimulated studies on potential applications of PNP inhibitors as therapeutic agents, primarily for selective suppression of cellular immunity without compromise of humoral immunity, as well as for treatment of malignant lymphoproliferative diseases, for suppression of the host-versus-graft response in organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, and to counter autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, etc. Since an additional symptom of PNP deficiency is a decrease in plasma and urine levels of urate, PNP inhibitors may be useful in hyperuricemic states, such as secondary or xanthine gout. Earlier investigations in this field have been reviewed by Stoeckler (1984), Sircar and Gilbertsen (1988), and Gilbertsen and Sircar (1990). The following includes only some of the more recent developments in this field. Among the many known potent inhibitors, BCX-34 (see Fig. 21 and Section 6.1.3), with an IC50 versus the human erythrocyte enzyme in the nanomolar range,

404

A. Bzowska et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 88 (2000) 349±425

appears to be the only one currently undergoing clinical trials, for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, HIV infections, and psoriasis (Conry et al., 1998; Morris & Omura, 2000; Morris et al., 2000). The compound inhibits proliferation of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and CD4 and CD8 cells, variously stimulated to induce proliferation, with IC50 values in the range 0.2± 15 mM (Conry et al., 1998). The antiproliferative effect on T-cell lines, but not B-cell lines, was not due to suppression of IL-2 production (Wada et al., 1996; Iwata et al., 1998). This suggests that BCX-34 may be a selective T-cell immunosuppressive drug for use in combination, not competition, with cyclosporine A and FK506, currently in use as the primary immunosuppressants in organ transplantation, by inhibition of signal transduction of the cytokine IL-2. Suppression of proliferation of the human T-lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell line by BCX-34 was accompanied by accumulation of intracellular dGTP and reduction of GTP. The mechanism appears to be dGuo-dependent, in contrast to normal human T-cells, where it is dual, both dGuodependent and dGuo-independent (Bantia et al., 1996; Conry et al., 1998). BCX-34 is orally bioavailable (76%) in rats and pharmacologically active in rodents after oral dosing, with no apparent toxicity or side effects, and, therefore, may be considered at least a potential candidate for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and HIV infections (Bantia et al., 1996; Morris et al., 2000). Its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have now been investigated extensively in healthy volunteers, following single and multiple oral doses (Viegas et al., 2000). A drug dose-dependent elevation of dGuo was observed, as well as an increase in the level of urine Ino. The calculated terminal half-life of the drug was $ 3.5 hr, and the bioavailability of the oral formulation was $ 50%. Trials have been conducted with 9-thienylmethyl-substituted purines (see Fig. 19), such as 8-amino-9-(2-thienylmethyl)Gua (PD 119229, CI-950), 9-deaza-9-(3thienylmethyl)Gua (PD 141955, CI-1000, BCX-5), and 8-amino-9-deaza-9-(3-thienylmethyl)Gua (CI-972) (Sircar et al., 1987; Gilbertsen et al., 1992). These were tested in the standard assay system for T-cell selective immunosuppressive agents, that is, cytotoxic effects on growth of human T-, but not B-, lymphoblastoid cell lines, MOLT-4 and MGL-8, respectively, by monitoring inhibition of uptake of thymidine in the presence of dGuo. In the presence of inhibitor, exogenously added dGuo was highly cytotoxic to MOLT-4 cells, presumably because of its phosphorylation to dGTP, and inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Accumulation of dGTP indeed correlated with inhibition of thymidine uptake, and cell growth was restored by addition of Cyd (Gilbertsen et al., 1991b, 1992). Cell death may be due to necrosis or apoptosis, with some evidence in this case for a role of the latter, as well as a contribution of caspase-3-like proteases in

MOLT-4 cells subjected to the inhibitor CI-1000 (Gilbertsen et al., 1997; Posmantur et al., 1997). The potential utility of CI-972 and CI-1000 in therapy of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas has been examined with the Tcell line MyLa originating from a patient with mycosis fungoides. Both exhibited significant dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation (Boehncke et al., 1994), and significantly retarded nucleoside degradation in rat, monkey, and human blood (Dong & Gilbertsen, 1993; Gilbertsen & Dong, 1994). Oral administration of the inhibitors in rats led to retardation of nucleoside degradation in the plasma (Gilbertsen et al., 1992). Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CI-1000 in rats and monkeys demonstrated, in the case of monkeys, induction of changes in plasma purines by repeated doses of the inhibitor (Hallak et al., 1994; Robertson et al., 1994; Wolfgang et al., 1995), with subacute toxicity in rats (Wolfgang et al., 1995). CI-972, the first inhibitor evaluated in Phase I clinical trials, however, did not lead to elevation of plasma nucleosides. Nor did it reduce fructose-induced hyperuricemia in an animal model of gout (Dong & Gilbertsen, 1993). CI-1000 proved appreciably more potent in all systems studied, both in vitro (including suppression of the human mixed lymphocyte reaction; Wilburn et al., 1993) and in animals (Gilbertsen et al., 1992). Earlier animal trials (see Gilbertsen & Sircar, 1990) included the effects of oral or intravenous administration of inhibitors, for example, 8-aminoGuo and 8-aminoganciclovir (PD116124, see Fig. 17). In an animal model of gout, CI-950 appeared promising for use in some hyperuricemic states (Gilbertsen & Sircar, 1990). Oral administration of 8-aminoganciclovir (PD 116124) to adjuvant arthritic rats led to a dose-dependent reduction in hindpaw swelling, albeit well below the level attainable with classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Dong et al., 1992). Following a report (Benear et al., 1986) that 8-aminoGuo prolonged skin graft survival in dogs, Slichter et al. (1990) demonstrated that the same inhibitor, administered intravenously at nontoxic doses in a dog model, induced tolerance to foreign transfused platelet antigens, whereas B-cell immunity to soluble antigens remained intact. Pharmacokinetic analysis of 9-benzyl-9deazaGua in rats showed it to be 50% orally bioavailable, and intravenous administration led to more than 50% inhibition of the PNP level in erythrocytes for 40 min (Bennett et al., 1993), but it should be recalled that, in the rat, the level of erythrocyte PNP is much lower than in humans. Finally, it should once again be noted that many potent inhibitors exhibit poor cellular permeability and/or a short plasma half-life. A good example of the former is the series of potent Zn2 + -dependent [[(guaninylalkyl)phosphinico]methyl]phosphonate inhibitors developed by Kelley et al. (1995), which only very weakly potentiated the cytotoxicity of dGuo in human leukemic T-cell lines, even in the presence of Zn2 + .

7.3.2. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase and nucleoside therapy Some nucleoside analogues with antitumour and/or antiviral activities are susceptible to intracellular cleavage by PNP prior to their metabolic conversion to the active species by phosphorylation by nucleoside kinases. This has stimulated efforts to potentiate therapeutic activity of such analogues by co-administration of mammalian PNP inhibitors, for example, 9-benzyl-9-deazaGua significantly prolongs the life time of the antiviral agent 2H,3H-dideoxyIno in the plasma of rats (Bennett et al., 1993). A similar potentiating effect has been noted with a phosphonate derivative of 9-benzylGua (MDL 74,428) in leukemic and red blood cells, and in the plasma of mice. However, coadministration of the latter with 2H,3H-dideoxyIno did not result in any enhancement of activity of the nucleoside against the cytopathogenic effects of HIV in T-leukemic CEM lymphoblasts (Weibel et al., 1994). In retrospect, bearing in mind that a primary objective of inhibitors of mammalian PNP is their application as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents (Bennett et al., 1993), it is questionable whether they may simultaneously serve as co-drugs for therapeutically active nucleoside analogues. An alternative approach to circumvent the possible deleterious effects of intracellular PNP is based on the design of chemotherapeutically active nucleoside analogues resistant to mammalian PNPs. Several such candidates now exist, for example, the antitumour agent 9-b-D-arabinofuranosylGua (araG), which has been shown to effectively purge bone marrow of contaminating malignant T-cells with no irreversible toxicity to hemopoietic stem cells, and has been proposed for clinical trials in patients with T-cell malignancies undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (Gravatt et al., 1993). Another such PNP-resistant nucleoside is 2-amino-6-methoxypurine arabinoside, which is intracellularly converted by ADA to araG, and has been reported in clinical trials against refractory hematological malignancies (Lambe et al., 1995). An additional candidate is 2H,2H-difluorodeoxyGuo (Gandhi et al., 1995). It is also worth recalling that acyclonucleoside analogues, noncleavable by PNP, are excellent candidates as antiviral agents by virtue of their phosphorylation by viral TKs (Shugar, 1999). A relatively recent novel development stems from widespread findings (Kierdaszuk et al., 1999; Verri et al., 1999; see Wang et al., 1999) that mammalian nucleoside kinases (cytosolic and mitochondrial TK1 and TK2, respectively, deoxycytidine kinase, deoxyguanosine kinase) and viral TKs, responsible for intracellular phosphorylation of therapeutic nucleoside analogues to their active species, do not necessarily discriminate between the four possible stereoisomeric forms of a nucleoside, b-D (the natural form), b-L, a-D, a-L. A typical example is deoxycytidine kinase (for which dAdo and dGuo are also substrates), now known to phosphorylate b-L-dCyd as effectively as the natural b-D-

dCyd. Quite surprising was the finding that the a-anomer of 2H,3H-dideoxyCyd is a 3 -fold better substrate than its natural b-anomer. Deoxyguanosine kinase readily phosphorylates a-L-dGuo and, to a lesser extent, b-L-dAdo. It has even been found that deoxycytidine kinase can use L-ATP as a phosphate donor as effectively as the natural D-ATP. Nucleoside stereoisomers have received little attention as potential substrates or inhibitors of PNP. It was reported Ï Â long ago (Doskocil & Holy, 1977) that the a- and bannomers of the L- and D-enantiomers of 9-arabinofuranosyladenine are not substrates, and only very poor inhibitors, of the E. coli enzyme, whereas 9-(a-L-lyxofuranosyl)Ade is a very weak substrate. In addition, while 1-(b-D-xylofuranosyl)Hx is not a substrate for human PNP, 9-(a-Llyxofuranosyl)Hx is a moderately good substrate (Stoeckler, 1984; see also Section 3.4.1). The substrate properties of some anomeric nucleosides for E. coli PNP have been qualitatively described by Secrist et al. (1999). It is clear that investigations of the substrate/inhibitor properties of stereoisomeric nucleosides with PNPs from various sources should prove profitable, not only for development of additional therapeutically active nucleoside analogues, but also for further delineation of the structural requirements for substrates and inhibitors (see Wang et al., 1999; Maury, 2000). 7.3.3. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase of protozoan parasites Despite the devastating effects of protozoan parasites, 2 million deaths annually from malaria alone (World Health Organization, 1997), it was pointed out in a review by Wang (1984), and 10 years later in a series of articles in Science (Aldhous, 1994), that neglect of efforts to develop effective therapeutic agents is due to economic and political factors, since it is largely a problem of the Third World. However, perhaps not for long, bearing in mind the enormous increase in air travel. This problem recently was again pin-pointed (Enserink, 2000). 7.3.3.1. Metabolic differences between parasites and humans. It has long been known that the most striking metabolic differences between parasites and humans is the purine salvage pathway. In contrast to mammalian cells, which can synthesize purine rings de novo, all classified protozoan parasites are auxotrophic for purines, and can propagate in a defined growth medium only on addition of a source of purines. Moreover, each genus of parasite has evolved its own unique array of purine salvage enzymes, enabling the organism to scavenge purines from the host (Berens et al., 1995; Hwang & Ullman, 1997). This constitutes the basis for the susceptibility of Leishmania and Trypanosoma to some pyrazolopyrimidine analogues of natural purines and their nucleosides, such as allopurinol (4-hydroxypyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), a drug that is nontoxic to humans and used for treatment of hyperuricemia and gout. This analogue is metabolized to the nucleotide

level by these parasites, but not by mammalian cells, followed by incorporation into nucleic acids, and has demonstrated some efficacy in treatment of mice with experimental acute Chagas disease (see Berens et al., 1984) and of patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and chronic Chagas disease (see, e.g., Hwang & Ullman, 1997). Efforts to identify crucial parasite enzymes involved in purine salvage include, among others, the use of host enzyme-deficient cells (see below). More recently, major strides have been achieved with the use of genetic manipulations of parasites (see, e.g., Mamoun et al., 1999), a good example of which is the application of genetic analysis to delineate the role of three potential enzyme targets in Leishmania donovani (Hwang & Ullman, 1997). This was based on the use of null mutants genetically deficient in HGPRT and/or adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, generated by targeted gene replacement in wild-type cells and pre-existing mutant strains lacking either adenine phosphoribosyltransferase or adenosine kinase activity. Thus, it was found that none of these three enzymes, either individually or in combination, was essential for survival or growth, or as valid targets for chemotherapy, and pointed to an important, possibly key, role for xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase in purine salvage, at least for this organism. Of possible relevance to the foregoing is the fact that purine salvage in Trichomonas foetus, which causes embryonic death and infertility in cows, is dependent on hypoxanthine ±guanine ± xanthine ribosyltransferase, an enzyme that has been well characterized, including its three-dimensional structure. This was profited from for design of non-nucleoside inhibitors, with Ki $ 10 mM, and without effect on the homologous human erythrocyte enzyme at concentrations up to 1 mM (Somoza et al., 1998). 7.3.3.2. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase in protozoan parasites. Numerous reports describe the presence in protozoan parasites of PNP activities with specificities and other properties differing from those of their mammalian hosts (see Table 2 and Section 3). It is generally assumed that these enzymes play some role in purine salvage by the parasites, and that they represent reasonable targets for chemotherapy. However, no protozoan PNP has been purified to homogeneity as yet, like the corresponding nucleoside hydrolases from the same organisms (see below). Daddona et al. (1986) succeeded in culturing the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in PNP-deficient human erythrocytes. PNP activity was not detectable in the uninfected red blood cells, and following infection, rose to 1.5% of normal erythrocyte levels. Despite the very high level of PNP in normal erythrocytes, this level of parasite PNP in infected cells may not play a ``minor'' role, as implied by the authors, the more so in that its properties differ from those of the human erythrocyte enzyme. The parasite enzyme was not cross-reactive with antibody versus the human enzyme, and had an Mr of 147 kDa, so that, unlike the human enzyme, it may be a member of

the high-mm class of PNPs. Although the authors did not make use of sodium dodecyl sulphate ± polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the enzyme, unlike the trimeric human erythrocyte PNP, is probably a hexamer. It was active against Ino, Guo, and dGuo, but not Ado; and, significantly, it was inhibited competitively by formycin B (Ki, 1 mM), which is a weak inhibitor of the human erythrocyte enzyme (Ki, 100 mM). A PNP was isolated from the bird malarial parasite Plasmodium lophurae, and purified almost 100-fold by affinity chromatography on a formycin B column (Schimandle et al., 1985). Its Mr, 125 kDa, and subunit Mr of 24 kDa, suggested that it is a pentamer, rather unusual for such an enzyme (see Table 2 and Section 3). It exhibited a very marked preference for Ino and Hx relative to Guo, Gua, and 6-thioinosine, while neither adenine nor allopurinol were substrates in the reverse reaction. Curiously, Ado was not tested as a potential substrate. It is, therefore, worth recalling that whereas Ado is not a substrate, but is a moderate competitive inhibitor, of Cellulomonas PNP, adenine is a substrate in the reverse synthetic reaction (Section 3). It is of some interest that formycin B, but not formycin A, was a good inhibitor (Ki, 0.4 mM), bearing in mind that formycin B, but not formycin A, is a weak inhibitor (Ki, 100 mM) of the mammalian enzyme, and both are good inhibitors of E. coli PNP (see Section 6). 7.3.3.3. Adenosine phosphorylases. A rather unusual ``adenine nucleoside phosphorylase'' was partially purified (25-fold) long ago from extracts of epimastigotes of the Peru strain of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease (Miller et al., 1987). The enzyme, with an Mr of 68 kDa, efficiently cleaved 5H-deoxy-5H-methylthioadenosine (MTA). However, in striking contrast to the enzyme from mammalian sources, it also cleaved and synthesized Ado and dAdo. Several criteria established that the three substrates bind to a common catalytic site, for example, mutual competitive inhibition between substrates, with Ki values equivalent to the respective Km values; competitive inhibition by 5H-deoxy-5H-chloroformycin, with the same Ki of 4 mM for each substrate; and a common Km of 180 mM for Pi with each substrate. In the reverse synthetic pathway, the enzyme exhibited a marked preference for substrates with a 6-amino group. A reasonable conclusion was that because of the differences in specificity from its mammalian counterpart, the enzyme could be considered an attractive target for selective chemotherapy against this parasite. Since the foregoing enzyme was only partially purified, it is pertinent to note that similar substrate properties have been reported for a homogeneous enzyme from a thermoacidophilic archaeon, Sulfolobus solfataricus (see Section 3). Concurrently, and independently, Ghoda et al. (1988) isolated by chromatofocusing a PNP from crude extracts of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, shown by various criteria to be similar to that from Trypanosoma cruzi. It cleaved, phosphorolytically, MTA, as well as Ado, dAdo, 3H-dAdo,

A. Bzowska et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 88 (2000) 349±425

407

and 2H,3H-ddAdo, and, to a lesser extent, the nucleoside analogue MePdR, a good substrate of E. coli PNP, currently under trial in tumour-directed gene therapy (see Section 7.4). The same organism contained an additional PNP that phosphorolysed Ino, Guo, and Ado, but not MTA. No attempt was made to characterize the Mr of either enzyme. Somewhat at variance with these findings is a report by Parkin (1996) that cell-free extracts of Trypanosoma brucei brucei contain negligible PNP activity, versus Ino, Guo, and Ado, relative to nucleoside hydrolase activity. An adenosine phosphorylase, active against MTA, Ado, 2HdAdo, and 2-chloro-2H-dAdo, has been identified in the trematode Fasciola hepatica (Trembacz & Jezewska, 1998). Ç 7.3.3.4. Nucleoside hydrolases. This section would be incomplete without at least a passing reference to nucleoside hydrolases, which nonphosphorolytically and irreversibly cleave the glycosidic bond of purine and, in some instances, pyrimidine nucleosides. These enzymes, with varying specificities for the base moiety, and conspicuously absent in mammalian cells, are widely distributed in protozoan parasites (see Shi et al., 1999a, 1999b), where they fulfill an important role in the purine salvage pathway. Several of these hydrolases have been purified to homogeneity, and their structures determined, both for the unliganded enzyme and for complexes with TS analogue inhibitors, by Schramm and co-workers (see Degano et al., 1998; Shi 1999a, 1999b). Such inhibitors have been reported with Ki values in the low nanomolar range. However, depending on the base moiety of the inhibitor, it is conceivable that these may also inhibit mammalian PNP, which could limit their use as antiparasitic agents. It should also be noted that, as for several of the parasitic PNPs described above, formycin B is a competitive inhibitor (Ki = 13 mM) of a highly purified nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and discriminates between different nucleoside hydrolases (Parkin, 1996). Bearing in mind that formycins A and B discriminate between E. coli and mammalian PNPs (Section 6.3), it would be useful to also examine the potential of formycin A as an inhibitor of parasitic PNPs and nucleoside hydrolases. The metabolism of pyrazolopyrimidines in parasitic protozoa was reviewed some time ago by Ullman (1984), including the possible utility of formycins A and B as chemotherapeutic agents. 7.4. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase in tumour-directed gene therapy Various strategies are currently under development to selectively target and destroy tumour cells that have been transduced with a foreign gene encoding an enzyme that either does not exist or differs in specificity from the corresponding enzyme in mammalian cells. Delivery of the required gene into the appropriate cells is usually achieved with the aid of viral vectors (see Uckert & Walther,

1994). One of the first such approaches employs a gene encoding an enzyme that is capable of converting a relatively nontoxic prodrug to a potent cytotoxic agent, also referred to as selective ``suicide'' gene therapy. A widely studied system (Culver & Blaise, 1994) employs the TK gene of the herpes simplex virus, which confers sensitivity to the antiherpes drug GCV by phosphorylating it to the MP (GCV-MP). GCV is, at best, only a very feeble substrate for mammalian nucleoside phosphotransferases (see Shugar, 1999). GCV-MP is then further phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the TP (GCV-TP), resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death. It was observed early that in cells transduced with the viral gene, the GCV-TP kills not only cells expressing the viral TK, but also adjacent tumour cells that lack the viral gene, a phenomenon referred to as the ``bystander effect,'' presumed to be due to diffusion of GCV-TP to adjacent tumour cells. However, the highly charged GCV-TP is not readily permeable to cell membranes, so that diffusion into neighbouring cells probably is limited to those with gap junctions, an obvious drawback of this system. The same applies to the use of the TK gene of the varicella zoster virus, employed because of its celltargeted expression in a-fetoprotein or albumin-positive cells, such as hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The hepatoma-specific expression of this gene results in sensitivity to 6-methoxypurine arabinonucleoside, followed by its anabolism to the cytotoxic araATP (Huber et al., 1991). A considerably more effective model, as regards the level of the ``bystander effect,'' is that in which human colorectal cells were transduced with the gene for E. coli cytosine deaminase (an enzyme not present in human cells), followed by treatment with 5-fluorocytosine. This is rapidly deaminated by the E. coli cytosine deaminase to the known antitumour agent fluorouracil, which is highly cell permeable. In accordance with this, its antitumour effects were significant even when, as is frequently the case, only a small proportion of the cells expresses cytosine deaminase activity (Huber et al., 1994). Another promising approach under active investigation (see Secrist et al., 1999) is based on the use of a nucleoside analogue that is nontoxic to the organism, but the cleavage of which at the glycosidic bond releases the heterocyclic base, which is an active cytotoxic agent. One prerequisite is that the nucleoside is not susceptible to cleavage by human erythrocyte enzymes, such as PNP or MTA phosphorylase. The differences in specificities between the PNPs from humans and E. coli (see Bzowska et al., 1990), the most significant being the ability of the E. coli enzyme to accept adenosine and adenosine analogues as substrates (but see also Section 3.4), suggest several potential candidate nucleoside prodrugs, the most intensively investigated being MePdR. It is a good substrate for E. coli, but not human, PNP; and its cleavage product, 6-methylpurine (MeP), is almost 200-fold more cytotoxic than the parent nucleoside. The key role of the bystander effect is strikingly illustrated by a report that transient expression of E. coli PNP in

408

a human colonic carcinoma cell line treated with MePdR in vitro was capable of mediating virtually total cell population killing, even when only 1% of the cells expressed the E. coli PNP gene (Sorscher et al., 1994). A similar result was subsequently reported for bystander killing with MePdR of a transduced melanoma cell line (Hughes et al., 1995). Furthermore, whereas the enzyme/prodrug systems with viral TK and E. coli cytosine deaminase, referred to above, are therapeutically active only during cell replication, it has been reported that MeP, because it inhibits translation, as well as DNA replication and transcription (Sorscher et al., 1994), is also active against nonreplicating tumours. An evaluation of this system relative to those employing viral TK and E. coli cytosine deaminase, with the use of foamy virus vectors for transduction, demonstrated that the MePdR system is by far the most potent (Nestler et al., 1997). Undoubtedly, one of the factors contributing to the higher efficiency of the E. coli/MePdR system is that cellto-cell contact is not required for bystander cell killing (Hughes et al., 1998). Apart from MeP, four additional cytotoxic purine analogues, the nucleosides of which are good substrates of E. coli PNP, have been proposed as potential candidates (Secrist et al., 1999), with in vitro toxicities ranging from an IC50 of 0.1 mM for 2-fluoroadenine and 1 mM for MeP to 10 mM for 3-deazaGua. However, the nucleosides of two of these, 3-deazaGua and 6-thioGua, are substrates of the mammalian enzyme (Stoeckler, 1984) and, therefore, are excluded. The three remaining good candidates are shown in Fig. 27. Unexpectedly, although the cytotoxicities of 2-fluoroadenine (IC50, 0.1 mM) and its substrate nucleoside analogue 2-fluoro-9-b-D-arabinofuranosyladenine (F-araA, 0.1 ± 2 mM) do not differ significantly, evaluations in animals showed that mice could tolerate a 10-fold higher concentration of this nucleoside than MePdR (Parker et al., 1997), while, as mentioned above, 2-fluoroadenine is 10-fold more potent than MeP in its ability to kill cells. Hence, 2-fluoroadenine appears worthy of further investigation, and recently, a new convenient synthesis of 2H-deoxy-2-fluoroadenosine as a potential prodrug for such therapy was developed (Hassan et al., 2000). Furthermore, Mohr et al. (2000) have demonstrated that expression of E. coli PNP in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines highly sensitized them

to F-araA, and expression of the enzyme in only 10% of the cells was sufficient to induce killing of most bystander cells. A search for additional purine nucleoside analogues with cytotoxic purine bases, which are specific substrates for E. coli PNP, is to be expected. It should be recalled, for example, that 1-methyl-Ino, 1-methyl-Guo, and the neutral form of 1-methyl-Ado are all good substrates for the E. coli, but not mammalian, PNP (Bzowska et al., 1988, 1990, 1992). It would also be profitable to examine the specificities of PNPs from other microorganisms relative to that of human cells, for example, the MTAP/PNP of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, and a mycoplasma PNP, both phosphorolytically cleave MePdR (Ghoda et al., 1988). 7.4.1. Animal studies Evaluations of MePdR and F-araA in animal studies have been reported. In one of these (Parker et al., 1997), nude mice bearing malignant glioma tumours expressing E. coli PNP were treated with MePdR or F-araA (actually F-araAMP, which is more soluble, and is dephosphorylated intracellularly to F-araA). Both of these exhibited significant antitumour activity against the tumours at doses with no systemic toxicity. Exposure of the tumours to MePdR for less than one doubling time at appropriate E. coli PNP levels resulted in complete regressions and cures. In a companion pharmacological study (Parker et al., 1998), the mechanisms of cytotoxicity of MeP and 2-fluoroadenine in human cells appeared to be due to their metabolism to ATP analogues that inhibit reactions involved in protein synthesis and/or RNA transcription (cf., Sorscher et al., 1994). Subsequently, Mohr et al. (2000), using F-araA concentrations far below those employed by Parker et al. (1997), demonstrated that subcutaneous and intrahepatic human hepatocarcinoma formation in nude mice produced by an E. coli PNP-expressing cell line could be fully abolished by treatment with F-araA. Furthermore, delivery of the E. coli PNP gene, followed by administration of F-araA, was effective in the treatment of established tumours. Based on the finding that a TK-deleted mutant vaccinia virus replicates selectively in tumour tissues in animal models, so that an intravenous injection leads to high gene expression within tumour tissue, Puhlmann et al. (1999) investigated the cytotoxic properties of the E. coli PNP/ MePdR system, with the PNP expressed by an optimized

synthetic early/late promoter in a vaccinia virus. At a low multiplicity of infection (0.002), replication-competent virus, and MePdR at a concentration of 80 mM, reduced tumour cell viability to 20% within 4 days, accompanied by total abrogation of viral replication following intracellular conversion of MePdR to the toxic MeP. In an extension to an animal model, virus was delivered intraperitoneally into athymic mice with hepatic metastases. Following administration of MePdR, there was significant prolongation of survival of the mice, with a 30% cure rate. Furthermore, despite the fact that the athymic mice were injected with a live vaccinia virus, no viral toxicity was observed in the animals. Martiniello-Wilks et al. (1998) have evaluated the effectiveness of two enzyme/prodrug systems, the herpes TK/GCV and the E. coli PNP/MePdR, for treatment of the invariably lethal human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vivo. The viral TK gene or the E. coli PNP gene, each under control of a selected promoter fragment, was delivered by a replication-deficient human adenovirus into PC-3 tumours growing subcutaneously in BALB/c nude mice, followed in each case by administration of GCV or MePdR. With the treatment protocols employed, both procedures led to a reduction of $ 80% in tumour growth, relative to controls. However, whereas 20% of the GCV-treated animals survived for more than 45 days, a similar 20% of the MePdR-treated animals survived more than 450 days. Suicide gene therapy with the herpes simplex virus-TK/ GCV has been mooted as a solution to the control of GVHD or other immunopathologies. The selectiveness for dividing cells of the TK/GCV system and its conditional character, in that it depends on GCV administration, makes it particularly well-suited for selective elimination of proliferating donor T-cells responsible for GVHD during allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see Cohen et al., 1999). 8. Analytical and preparative methods 8.1. Methods of purification of purine nucleoside phosphorylases Earlier methods of purification are described in some detail by Stoeckler (1984). Commercially available is the purified enzyme from calf spleen, one partially purified from human erythrocytes, and a crude extract from Cellulomonas sp. A Sigma ``bacterial'' PNP has been assumed by many to be the enzyme from E. coli (Sigma refuses to divulge the source), but we have pointed out elsewhere (Bzowska et al., 1992) that its origin may be Cellulomonas (TOYOBO). The calf spleen enzyme exhibits a single band on sodium dodecyl sulphate ± polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but its specific activity varies from 16 to 27 U/ mg. Affinity chromatography on 9-p-aminobenzylHx, as described for human erythrocyte PNP by Osborne (1980), gave a product with a specific activity of 34 U/mg

(Bzowska et al., 1995a; Koellner et al., 1997), showing that the commercial enzyme was partially inactivated. Commercial Cellulomonas PNP has a specific activity of $ 8 U/mg. Following purification by ion exchange chromatography on a BioCad station (Bzowska et al., 1998b; Tebbe et al., 1999), its specific activity rose to 107 U/mg. Formycin B affinity columns have been widely employed for purification of PNP from human erythrocytes and sources such as E. coli, Serratia marcescens, Plasmodium lophurae (Stoeckler, 1984; Schimandle et al., 1985; Bzowska et al., 1998a; Choi, 1998; Hall & Krenitsky, 1990). Affinity chromatography on MTA-Sepharose was a key step in purification of MTAP, which also exhibits PNP activity, from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Cacciapuoti et al., 1994; see Section 3). Existence and separation of isozymes of human erythrocyte PNP are discussed in Section 3.3. Numerous combinations of other techniques, such as ammonium sulphate fractionation, heat, acid, and acetone treatment; organomercurial and ion-exchange chromatographies; and chromatofocusing and gel filtration, have been utilized for purification of the enzyme from various microorganisms (e.g., Utagawa et al., 1985; Koszalka et al., 1988; Hori et al., 1989a, 1989b; Hamamoto et al., 1996, 1997a, 1997b). 8.2. Methods of assay These were earlier reviewed by Parks and Agarwal (1972) and Stoeckler and Parks (1985). The most widely used procedure is still that of Kalckar (1947a), in which the Hx released by phosphorolysis of Ino is coupled with Xox to generate uric acid, as follows: ÀÀ À Pi  Ino ÀÀ À Hx  ribose À 1 À P 23 À Hx  2O2  2H2 O À3 uric acid  2H2 O2 OÀ  2 Formation of uric acid is monitored spectrally by the increase in absorbance at 293 nm. In screening for potential inhibitors, the latter must be shown not to inhibit the Xox. On the other hand, more direct assays, described below, may be employed. The foregoing coupling procedure is employed because of the small differences in spectral properties between Ino and Hx. However, the liberated Hx may be isolated and monitored, for example, in a reported capillary electrophoresis assay (Adam et al., 1997, 1998), in which the liberated Hx was monitored by UV detection. When applied to lysed erythrocytes, measured PNP levels were in good agreement with results obtained by the less convenient HPLC (Fairbanks et al., 1983; Simmonds et al., 1991). It is, of course, applicable to all nucleoside substrates of PNP. Capillary electrophoresis has also been employed for detection of inborn errors of purine and pyrimidine metabolism by identifying and monitoring clinically important metabolites in urine samples from patients with purine and pyrimidine enzyme deficiencies (Adam et al., 1999).
Xox PNP

The phosphorolysis of Ino is used to define the most common specific activity unit. One unit of PNP is defined as the amount of enzyme that will cause phosphorolysis of 1 mmol of inosine to hypoxanthine and R-1-P per min at 25°C with 0.5 mM inosine and 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The reverse synthetic reaction has also been utilized, most recently in an automated microtiter plate assay for PNP, by monitoring colorimetrically the Pi released by R-1P (Saheki et al., 1985; Erion et al., 1997b). In a novel variant of the Ino/Xox coupling procedure described above, originally developed for an assay of Pi (De Groot et al., 1985), Xox functions as a dehydrogenase (XDH) in the presence of a tetrazolium salt, which is reduced instead of molecular O2, as follows:
XDH Hx  2 tetrazolium salt ÀÀ uric acid  2 formazan À3

Following termination of the reaction, unreacted Ino is adsorbed on charcoal and the supernatant assayed for [2-3H]uric acid. A disadvantage of such methods is that they are not continuous, and also are expensive and time consuming. However, their sensitivity is high, and they may be used with crude cell extracts, for example, in cases of suspected PNP deficiency. In one instance where spectrophotometric procedures pointed to m7Gua as a very weak substrate in the reverse, synthetic reaction, it proved necessary to use a radiochemical method to confirm this significant finding (Erion et al., 1997a). 8.2.3. Continuous spectrophotometric or fluorimetric assays of phosphorolysis (m7Guo and analogues) Two excellent substrates of PNP are m7Guo and m7Ino, both commercially available. Their UV absorption spectra differ appreciably from those of the products of phosphorolysis, m7Gua and m7Hx. They are also fluorescent, whereas the products of phosphorolysis are not. Phosphorolysis, therefore, may be followed spectrophotometrically or fluorimetrically (Kulikowska et al., 1986; Bzowska et al., 1990). Phosphorolysis is irreversible with the enzymes from calf spleen (Kulikowska et al., 1986) and Cellulomonas (Hennen & Wong, 1989; referred to as ``E. coli'' PNP), and only slightly reversible with human erythrocyte PNP (Erion et al., 1997a), while the released methylated purines do not markedly inhibit phosphorolysis (Bzowska et al., 1988). The course of phosphorolysis, therefore, may be monitored continuously by changes in absorbance or fluorescence to completion of the reaction. It should be noted, however, that at alkaline pH (>8), both nucleosides are unstable, due to opening of the imidazole ring. The substrate properties of MESG have been reported comparable with those of m7Guo (Webb, 1992). Its phosphorolysis, like that of m7Guo, is essentially irreversible. This substrate has gained some popularity because phosphorolysis can be followed in the long-wavelength range of 355± 360 nm. However, at physiological pH, where m7Guo is quite stable, the half-life of MESG is appreciably shorter, for example, $ 4 hr at pH 8 and 25°C. It was employed as a substrate in a robot-based enzyme kinetics facility by Farutin et al. (1999), but subsequently abandoned in favour of Ino in follow-up studies (E.H. Cordes, personal communication), presumably because of problems associated with instability. Cheng et al. (1999) reported that at pH 7.4 and 25°C, nonenzymatic decomposition of MESG was sufficiently marked to require correction of kinetic data. 8.2.4. Continuous spectrophotometric or fluorimetric assays for synthetic pathway (8-azapurines) Whereas 8-azapurine nucleosides are resistant to phosphorolysis, the corresponding purines, 8-azaHx, 8-azaGua, and 8-azaAde, are substrates in the synthetic pathway, with Keq > 350. Conversion of the bases to the corresponding nucleosides may be followed spectrophotome-

Formation of the highly colored formazan product is followed spectrally in the range of 470 ± 550 nm. This variant has been adapted to automated microtiter plate format assays for mutant PNPs, with addition to the incubation medium of Triton X-100 to prevent slow precipitation of the formazan product (Erion et al., 1997b). It has also been applied to the histochemical localization of PNP in unfixed tissue sections (Frederiks et al., 1993), where the low solubility of the formazan product is the key to its success. 8.2.1. Assays based on the use of other coupling reagents/ enzymes Various techniques have been reported, intended largely for clinical purposes with the use of an autoanalyzer, in which the generation of H2O2 in the Ino/Xox-coupled reaction is linked via additional coupling enzymes and/or reagents to formation of a product absorbing in the near UV (e.g., NADH at 340 nm) or, even better, in the visible spectrum (see Heinz et al., 1980; Chu et al., 1989; Le Tissier et al., 1994). The latter authors describe a procedure requiring only one additional coupling enzyme, peroxidase, which converts H2O2 to H2O and O2, in the presence of 2,4,6-tribromohydroxybenzoic acid and 4amino-antipyrene, leading to formation of a dye complex with a high extinction coefficient at 520 nm. This assay is reported to be 10-fold more sensitive than other reported spectrophotometric methods. Because of the additional reagents and coupling enzymes required, the foregoing are clearly not readily applicable to studies of kinetics or properties of inhibitors. 8.2.2. Radiochemical methods Phosphorolysis of [8-14C]Ino or [8-14C]Guo may be followed by chromatographic isolation of the released labeled purines (Stoeckler & Parks, 1985). More convenient is the variant proposed by Chang et al. (1989), in which [2-3H]Ino phosphorolysis is coupled with Xox.

trically and, most conveniently, fluorimetrically with 8azaGua by the increase in emission in the range 330 ±360 nm (Wierzchowski et al., 1996). Although less sensitive, 8-azaAde may be used as a substrate for E. coli PNP. The best substrate for the human erythrocyte enzyme is 8azaGua, which provides a highly sensitive assay for PNP levels in crude cell extracts, such as hemolysates (J. Wierzchowski, unpublished). 8.2.5. Histochemical localization of purine nucleoside phosphorylase The procedure of De Groot et al. (1985), described above, in which Ino is coupled with Xox in the presence of a tetrazolium salt, leading to formation of a highly colored formazan precipitate, was profited from by Frederiks et al. (1993) to develop a histochemical procedure for localization of PNP in rat and human liver. Using unfixed sections, the distribution of the enzyme in the sections was determined by cytophotometry of the deposited formazan at 532 nm. A linear relationship was observed between time of incubation and the amount of reaction product, and the reaction was almost completely abolished by the nonspecific inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzoate. The results obtained were qualitatively in accordance with those previously reported, in which the liberated Pi was precipitated as a lead salt (Rubio & Berne, 1980; see Frederiks et al., 1993). The application of the theoretically sounder formazan procedure to localization and levels of PNP in normal and pathological states, combined with the use of specific PNP inhibitors, would appear deserving of further attention. 8.3. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase as a tool for enzymatic synthesis of nucleosides Although the kinetics of the reverse synthetic reaction by PNPs from various sources has been much less extensively investigated than the kinetics of phosphorolysis, the reverse pathway has been widely exploited as a tool for synthesis of nucleoside analogues with potential antiviral and antineoplastic activities. This applies particularly to those instances where chemical synthetic procedures are arduous and/or relatively inefficient. These procedures are especially useful for preparation of labeled nucleosides when the labeled purine is commercially available, but its desired nucleoside is not. Chemical synthesis in these cases often requires

introduction of protective groups, is typically more than a one-step reaction, and often gives low yields and regio- and stereoisomers of products. The general procedure for such syntheses involves the use of a PyNP to release the a-D-pentose-l-phosphate from uridine or thymidine, followed by its coupling to the desired purine base by PNP, as depicted in Fig. 28. The entire reaction sequence is conducted in a single vessel, a so-called ``one-pot'' synthesis. The use of a pyrimidine nucleoside as the donor of the pentose-1-phosphate is dictated in part by the expense of the latter, and is also useful for the synthesis of purine nucleosides with pentose rings other than ribose or deoxyribose, the pentose-1-phosphates of which are not readily accessible (see, e.g., Chae et al., 1998). The utility and applicability of such enzymatic syntheses of nucleosides was documented long ago in detail by Krenitsky et al. (1981), including descriptions of the partial purification of uridine and thymidine phosphorylases, and PNP, all from E. coli, and their stabilities and other properties over a wide range of conditions. These enzymes were employed for the synthesis of 6-dimethylamino-9-(b-D-deoxyribofuranosyl)purine and 2-amino-6-chloro-9-b-D-ribofuranosylpurine, each in 80% yield. A subsequent excellent illustration of the foregoing procedure, from the same laboratory, embraces the synthesis of 21 6-alkoxypurine-2 H,3 H-dideoxy nucleosides, potential inhibitors of the cytopathic effects of HIV. The a-D-2H,3H-dideoxyR-1-P, generated from 3H-deoxythymidine by thymidine phosphorylase from E. coli, was coupled to the desired 6-alkoxypurine by PNP from the same organism. To facilitate isolation of the products, both enzymes were immobilized on DE-52 cellulose. The desired nucleosides, synthesized on a gram scale, were obtained in overall yields of up to 70%, a number of them in crystalline form (Burns et al., 1993). Trans-5H-Deoxyribosylation by PNP has been reported by Chae et al. (1998). Their inability to obtain satisfactory yields of the antitumour agent 5H-deoxy-6-thioguanosine by chemical methods prompted them to employ thymidine phosphorylase and PNP (source of the latter not given) for the synthesis of the 5H-deoxy analogues of 6-thioguanosine and 6-mercaptopurine riboside, as well as the corresponding 2H,5H-dideoxy congeners, in yields of 40 ± 50%. The versatility of such enzymatic syntheses is further exemplified by the trans-a-L-2H,3H-deoxyribosylations described by Van Draanen and Koszalka (1994),

Fig. 28. Enzymatic ``one-pot'' synthesis of purine nucleoside analogues. A pyrimidine nucleoside (B1 = pyrimidine) is cleaved by a PyNP (UP, thymidine phosphorylase) to release a-D-ribose-1-phosphate, which is then coupled by PNP to the desired purine base (B2 = purine) to give a purine nucleoside. Depending on enzyme specificity, the ribose ring of the pyrimidine nucleoside B1 may be replaced by 2H-deoxyribose, 2H,3H-dideoxyribose, arabinose, or some other pentose, to give the corresponding purine nucleoside.

following their finding that the chemical synthetic route for pyrimidine a-L-2H,3H-dideoxy nucleosides was inapplicable to the corresponding purine nucleosides. Profiting from an earlier observation that 9-(a-L-lyxofuranosyl)adeÏ Â nine is a substrate of E. coli PNP (Doskocil & Holy, 1977), they employed E. coli thymidine phosphorylase and PNP for the successful preparation of four purine aH H L-2 ,3 -dideoxynucleosides in 60 ±80% yields, with retention in all cases of the sugar a-L-configuration. An interesting variant of the general procedure proposed by Hennen and Wong (1989), using only one phosphorylase (PNP), is based on the finding that m7Guo and m7Ino are excellent substrates for PNP from calf spleen or E. coli. The products of the reaction, m7Gua and m7Hx, do not markedly inhibit phosphorolysis, nor are they substrates in the reverse reaction (Kulikowska et al., 1986; Bzowska et al., 1990; see also Section 3.4.2). The reaction medium, therefore, contained m7Guo (or m7Ino) as the ribose phosphate donor, the desired purine base acceptor, and only PNP, which generated R-1-P from m7Guo and coupled it to the desired purine. Three known nucleosides were synthesized in this manner in yields of 60 ±100%. The PNP used in this study was a partially purified commercial product (TOYOBO), the properties of which were not then known, but recently have been characterized following its purification to homogeneity (Bzowska et al., 1998b; Wielgus-Kutrowska et al., 1998, 1999; Tebbe et al., 1999). There are numerous reports on the use of resting cells of various microorganisms capable of catalyzing nucleoside Ntransfer reactions, without isolation of the nucleoside phosphorylases involved. An excellent illustration is that of Shirae and co-workers (Shirae et al., 1989; Shirae & Yokozeki, 1991b), who screened a wide range of microorganisms for their ability to produce purine 2H,3H-dideoxynucleosides by transdideoxyribosylation, and selected one strain, E. coli AJ 2595, which gave the desired dideoxynucleosides, for example, 2H,3H-dideoxyadenosine, in more than 60% yield relative to the 2H,3H-dideoxyuridine donor. We do not discuss here enzymatic synthesis of such nucleoside antimetabolites as virazole (Hennen & Wong, 1989; Ling et al., 1994), ribavirin (Shirae & Yokozeki, 1991a, 1991c), and adenine arabinoside (Ling et al., 1990), which are easily synthesized chemically and are available commercially at low cost. Actually, glycosyl-transferring enzymes have been employed for some time for stereo-controlled synthesis of carbohydrates, as described by Drueckhammer et al. (1991), who also refer briefly to their use in synthesis of nucleosides. Enzymatic synthesis of antiviral nucleoside analogues has been described by Hanrahan and Hutchinson (1992), as well as the use of immobilized enzymes (Hicks & Hutchinson, 1994). A more recent review (Prasad et al., 1999) includes the use of enzymes other than PNP alone, such as Ndeoxyribosyltransferases and phoshopentomutase coupled with PNP.

8.4. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase in assays for inorganic phosphate The concentration of Pi is usually determined chemically by the formation of phosphomolybdate under acid conditions and its subsequent reduction to molybdenum blue (see De Groot et al., 1985). Most of these methods are interfered with by certain substances, and permit only a discontinuous measurement of Pi formation (e.g., Young et al., 1975). Enzymatic assay methods have not gained general acceptance, either because of their low sensitivity or interference from reducing substances (e.g., Guynn et al., 1972; Schulz et al., 1967). New enzymatic methods without these disadvantages are based on PNP and Xox systems to couple Pi uptake caused by phosphorolysis of Ino with the formation of spectrophotometrically measured products. De Groot et al. (1985) showed that two alternative procedures may be used for analytical purposes. One of them is a direct measurement of uric acid concentration by measurement of absorbance in the 293-nm region. In the other one, if tetrazolium salts such as 2-(4iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride are present, they are reduced instead of molecular O2, and the formazan formation may be followed between 470 and 550 nm: À3 Pi  Ino ÀÀ Hx  ribose À 1 À P Hx  2 tetrazolium salt À uric acid  2 formazan 3 The method of De Groot et al. (1985) was employed for the continuous assay of activity of phosphohydrolases and Piliberating enzymes, such as 5H-nucleotidase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphatase. The principle of the method developed by Fossati (1985) is similar, with 3-(4H,5H-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,4-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide as the chromogen (absorbance 550± 660 nm) to determine Pi in serum. Another approach, described by Ungerer et al. (1993), is based on addition of highly coloured 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), which is reduced to a colourless form by Xox, so that reduction may be followed spectrophotometrically at 600± 610 nm: 3 Pi  Ino À Hx  ribose À 1 À P Hx  DCIP oxidized À xanthine  DCIP reduced 3 xanthine  DCIPoxidized À uric acid 3  DCIP reduced The assay is automated and suitable for routine determination of serum Pi. The standard PNP ±Xox assay with inosine as a PNP substrate, and with the addition of peroxidase as a final step in the coupled enzyme system, was used to evaluate another sensitive and accurate colorimetric method of determination of inorganic phosphate in serum (Sugiura et al., 1981).

8.5. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase in coupled assays for other enzymes The dependence of phosphorolysis by PNP on Pi was exploited by Banik and Roy (1990) to couple this reaction with an ATPase, so that Pi liberated by the latter serves as the second substrate in a phosphorolytic reaction, as follows: ATP ÀÀ ADP  Pi À3 Pi  m7 Guo À3 m7 Gua  R À 1 À P À With m7Guo as the nucleoside substrate for PNP, the reaction could be followed fluorimetrically (Kulikowska et al., 1986), and was reported to be $ 10-fold more sensitive than the standard pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase assay for ATPases. As might be anticipated, the procedure was applicable to ATPases in general, as well as to GTPases. The foregoing method was subsequently modified to use a spectrophotometric assay for monitoring the kinetics of Pi release in biological systems (Webb, 1992). It is based on the use of PNP with MESG (see Section 3.4.2) as substrate. The large difference in extinction at 360 nm enables quantitation of Pi in solution to as low as 1 ±2 mM, which is comparable with the fluorimetric procedure of Banik and Roy (1990). By coupling the foregoing reaction with several ATPase systems, for example, actomyosin ATPase, it proved possible to continuously monitor the kinetics of phosphate release by the ATPases. The foregoing procedure has gained wider popularity than the fluorimetric assay, and has been employed for continuous spectrophotometric assays in numerous systems, such as GTPase-activating protein (Webb & Hunter, 1992), aspartate transcarbamylase (Wedler et al., 1994), protein phosphatases (Cheng et al., 1996), the glycogen phosphorylase-catalyzed reaction in the direction of glycogen synthesis (Sergienko & Srivastava, 1994), Pi release during nucleotide hydrolysis in actin or tubulin assembly (Melki et al., 1996), and as a ``Pi mop'' for removal of Pi from solution, with the aid of phosphodeoxyribomutase (Nixon et al., 1998). A ``Pi mop'' with the use of PNP and its unusual substrate NR + (see Section 3.4.2) has also been described and used to remove phosphate from NMR samples (Shriver & Sykes, 1982). Recently, Rieger et al. (1997) described a continuous spectrophotometric assay for aspartate transcarbamylase and ATPases, based on the coupling of Pi release with phosphorolysis of m7Ino. This offers several advantages over the use of MESG, in that m7Ino is commercially available, better soluble, more stable, and spectrally sensitive over the broader pH range. The authors also applied this procedure to determination of the kinetic parameters for the DNA-dependent ATPase of herpes virus type 1 helicaseprimase, with results in good agreement with those reported by other methods. An enzyme sensor system for the determination of phosphate ions was constructed with the use of immobilized
PNP ATPase

enzymes and an oxygen electrode (Watanabe et al., 1987± 1988). The principle of this method is based on the PNP catalyzed reaction, for which Pi is indispensable. This system was applicable to simple, rapid, and continuous determination of phosphate ions in food. 9. Conclusions and perspectives Crystallographic data have hitherto provided a wealth of information on the three-dimensional structures, and the substrate-binding sites, of low-mm and high-mm PNPs from various sources, and this remains a fruitful field for further investigation, for example, X-ray structures of the high-mm Xao phosphorylases from E. coli and the highly thermophilic Sulfolobus solfataricus would be extremely useful for comparison with that of E. coli PNP. However, it cannot be too strongly emphasized that a number of reports in the literature underline the need for quantitative studies of the subunit structures of PNPs in solution and the probable existence of equilibria between different oligomeric states, as has been demonstrated already for other oligomeric enzymes. Determination of binding constants and stoichiometry of ligand binding also calls for more intensive studies. Such data would be highly relevant to the mechanism of action of these enzymes, and, at least in part, may contribute to interpretations of the complex kinetics exhibited by these enzymes. Notwithstanding the large number of highly potent inhibitors of PNP already available, there is still a pressing requirement for potent inhibitors with good membrane permeability. Bearing in mind the pressing need for effective antiparasitic agents, the role of protozoan PNPs (and nucleoside hydrolases), and inhibitors of these enzymes, as well as X-ray studies of parasite PNPs (e.g., from malaria parasite) calls for more intensive research in this field. In the field of nucleoside analogue antiviral and antitumour agents, the activities of which are dependent on intracellular phosphorylation by nucleoside kinases, the recent findings that these enzymes frequently do not discriminate between different stereoisomers almost begs for studies on substrate/inhibitor properties of such stereoisomers with PNPs from different sources, and the potential information from such studies on the specificities of the substrate-binding sites. Such studies may also lead to further development of substrates and inhibitors that discriminate between the PNPs from different sources, already being profited from, with the use of MePdR, for development of tumour-directed gene therapy.
