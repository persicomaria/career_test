INTRODUCTION Studies on viruses in hot aquatic ecosystems, at temperatures above 808C, revealed unusual morphotypes and quasi-orphan genome sequences which made it possible to establish several new families of double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses. Among them, the Lipothrixviridae are enveloped lipid-containing filamentous viruses with linear double-stranded DNA genomes (AFV1-8, TTV1-3, and Sulfolobus islandicus filamentous virus [SIFV]).1­4 The hosts of these viruses are hyperthermophilic and hyperacidophilic archaea of the genera Acidianus or Sulfolobus. The 35 genomes of archaeal viruses that are presently sequenced have in common that more than 80% of their ORFs do not share any sequence homology with ORFs of other viruses or organisms apart from other archaeal viruses.4 Putative functions based on weak sequence identities have been proposed for a few ORFs, including structural proteins, glycosyl transerases, helicases, and integrases. Apart from structural proteins, it is expected that other ORFs should code for enzymes or proteins involved in viral infection and replication, and be functional homologues of bacterial, archaeal, or eukaryotic proteins. Moreover, they may reveal novel features which can be exploited for biotechnological applications. To get insight into the function of the Lipothrixviridae proteome, we have initiated a program to determine the

structure of conserved ORFs. We present here the crystal structure of ORF14 of SIFV (Lipothrixviridae), a protein of 112 residues which has homologues in other archaeal viruses, Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus 1 (SIRV1, Rudiviridae; ORF99, ORF100, ORF95, and ORF96) and Acidianus filamentous virus 1 (AFV1, Lipothrixviridae; ORF99) [Fig. 1(A)]. SIFV-14 has a domain swapped structure and forms fiber structures in the crystal.

METHODS ORF14 of SIFV (SIFV-14) was cloned in pDest17 from the Gateway system (Invitrogen). A TEV protease cleavage site was inserted between the attB1 and the gene of interest. SIFV-14 was over expressed in E. coli and, after Ni-purification, SIFV-14 was eluted by gel filtration (described in Ref. 5). Its retention volume corresponds to a molecular weight of about 30 kDa, in agreement with a

Crystallization of the SeMet labeled protein is described elsewhere.5 Hexagonal crystals grew in cryopreservative compatible conditions, 18­26% PEG 4000, 0.5 M MgCl2, 33 mM HEPES, 0.2 M Imidazole malate pH 6.8­7.0. A single wavelength anomalous diffraction data° set at the Se-K edge (k 5 0.9798 A) was collected from a single crystal at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) beamline BM-16 using a MARCCD 165 detector.

Phases were calculated from the limit of 2.95 A peak data set using SOLVE,7 and solvent flattening was performed with RESOLVE,7 which yielded a partial model in the residue range 17­109 (b-sheet domain). This model was manually completed with COOT8 and was refined using REFMAC5.9 The final R and

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Overall structure

All residues are seen in the electron density map except two residues at the N- and C-termini. The structure is made up of an N-terminal helix (1­11), followed by an elongated stretch of residues (12­16) abutting a more compact core domain composed of two helices, an isolated b-strand, and a b-sheet of five anti-parallel bstrands [Fig. 1(B,C)]. Progressing from the N- to the Cterminus, the core domain contains successively helix 2 (17­30), b-strand 1 followed by the isolated b-strand 2 and the short helix 3. After helix 3 an elongated stretch of residues crosses the whole b-sheet to join its first strand (strand 3). The ensemble of two helices and two strands covers one side of the b-sheet, the other side is exposed to solvent. The core b-sheet is composed of strand 1 and of four antiparallel b-strands (strands 3­6). Searching with DALI11 for similar proteins in the PDB produced a wealth of hits with low Z values (4.7 or ° below) and relatively high rmsd values (2.5 A at best). These hits were essentially overlapping on the b-sheet (b strands 3­6), the best fit corresponds with a blade of the b-propeller of sialydase (1E8T).

SIFV-14 shares significant sequence homology with several ORFs from SIRV1, SIRV2, and AFV1 and is, therefore, conserved between both families of linear dsDNA viruses, the Lipothrixviridae and Rudiviridae. Interestingly, the homologues comprise only the core domain starting at residue 17 of SIFV-14 [Fig. 1(A)]. SIFV14 also contains a high proportion of charged residues, all located at the protein surface, with a large excess of negatively charged over positively charged residues (31 vs. 16). We did not identify cavities that could bind small molecules at the surface of the dimer, apart from the small central hole. Therefore, the structure does not seem to be in favour of an enzymatic/regulatory function for SIFV-14. In contrast, the formation of the fiber like arrangement in the crystal packing, due to intermolecular b-sheet interactions, may suggest a role as a virion structural protein, a hypothesis that remains to be validated.

Crystal packing and dimer assembly

The crystal packing of SIFV-14 displays a noteworthy arrangement. Viewing down the c axis of the unit cell, the units related by the hexagonal axis appear as hexagonal rods. Each rod is connected to its neighbors by the N-terminal extension, exhibiting a domain-swapped structure between symmetry related molecules. The Nterminal helix of one monomer interacts with the core barrel of the other [Fig. 1(B)]. Viewing down the a or b axis of the unit cell, the rods have a fiber like appearance. Each monomer is involved in three contacts: a domainswapped dimer can be reconstituted by pairing two molecules belonging to different hexagonal rods.
