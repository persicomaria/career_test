Key words: heteronuclear NMR, Holliday junction resolvase, structural genomics Biological context YqgF is an Escherichia coli hypothetical protein, which was found essential for E. coli growth (Freiberg et al., 2001). YqgF is a representative member of a functionally uncharacterized protein family found in many bacteria (Aravind et al., 2000). Iterative database searches suggested that YqgF is likely a homolog of the E. coli RuvC protein, a Holliday junction resolvase. YqgF was predicted to be a nuclease (Aravind et al., 2000), since its predicted secondary structure profile was similar to that of the RuvC protein, which possesses an RNAse H fold. More recently, the YqgF-homologous domains were identified in bacterial Tex orthologues and eukaryotic Spt6p orthologues within their CXZ regions (Ponting, 2002). Spt6p is a transcription elongation factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae whereas the molecular function of Tex is currently unknown. Here, we describe the solution structure of YqgF determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The structure of YqgF confirmed that YqgF is indeed structurally similar to RuvC; however, substantial differences between YqgF and RuvC were revealed. Unlike RuvC and other known Holliday junction resolvases, YqgF is likely monomeric in solution based on 15 N relaxation and size exclusion chromatography data. These findings provide valuable information to understand the biological function of YqgF and validate YqgF as a potential anti-microbial drug target. Methods and results Protein expression and purification have been described previously (Liu et al., 2002). Briefly, the

E. coli yqgF gene was cloned into a pET29 expression vector to produce a final construct encoding the YqgF protein with an N-terminal S-tag and a C-terminal His-tag. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The expressed protein was purified using a combination of Ni-NTA and size exclusion chromatography. The final protein product contains additional RGSMADIGS and LEHHHHHH polypeptide sequences at its N- and C-termini, respectively. All NMR spectra were acquired at 25  C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer, processed with FELIX980 (Accelrys Inc.), and analyzed with NMRView (Johnson and Blevins, 1994). The resonance assignments were obtained based on the following NMR experiments: HNCA, HNCOCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, 15 N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and HCCH-TOCSY (Kay, 1997). The backbone resonance assignments were obtained based on the HNCA, HNCOCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB experiments. The side chain aliphatic resonance assignments were obtained from analysis of 3D 15 N-edited TOCSY and 13 C-HCCH-TOCSY experiments. The aromatic ring proton resonances were assigned based on 2D TOCSY, NOESY and 3D 13 C- and 15 N-NOESY data. Stereospecific assignments of the prochiral methyl groups of valine and leucine residues were obtained by an analysis of the relative peak sign in a 2D 13 C,1 H-CTHSQC spectrum recorded on a sample obtained using 10% 13 C labeling as described previously (Neri et al., 1989). The side chain 1 H and 13 C chemical shifts of YqgF have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession code BMRB-5758). The structures of YqgF were calculated using XPLOR following the same protocol as described previously (Liu et al., 2001). The following 3D NOESY datasets were acquired: 3D 15 N-edited NOESY-

the 25 representative conformers (Figure 1) for the backbone atoms (C , C and N) excluding the nonstructured region (3­95, 124­136) is 0.85 ± 0.12 Å, and the RMSD for all the heavy atoms of the same region is 1.37 ± 0.12 Å. For the residues in the regular secondary structures (residues 4­21, 25­31, 42­50, 55­59, 73­86, 90­94, 124­137), the RMSDs of backbone and heavy atoms are 0.50 ± 0.09 Å and 1.08 ± 0.11 Å, respectively. The atom coordinates of

the structure ensemble for YqgF have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID code: 1ovq). The structure of YqgF consists of a central sheet sandwiched by two helices on one side and one helix on the other side (Figure 2a), which is typical for an `--' fold. The central -sheet is formed by 5 mixed -strands in the order of 3-21-4-5. The strands 1, 2, and 3 are antiparallel to each other, whereas the strands 1, 4, and 5 are arranged in a parallel fashion. The secondary struc-

392 ture elements are arranged sequentially along the primary amino acid sequence in the following manner, 1(4-11)-2(14-21)-3(26-30)-1(42-50)-4(5659)-2(73-87)-5(91-93)-loop-3(124-136). A large segment of the sequence (96­123) is not structured since NOE data for this region are largely missing. Relaxation rates were determined using standard methods as described previously (Liu et al., 2001). The backbone 15 N R1 and R2 data were obtained to estimate the overall correlation time of YqgF. The average 15 N R1 and R2 rates were determined as 1.61 ± 0.32 S-1 and 17.5 ± 1.1 S-1 . Base on the ratio of R2 /R1 , the overall correlation time c was estimated to be 10.5 ns. Discussion and conclusions The structure of YqgF was compared with the crystal structure of Holliday junction resolvase, RuvC (PDB ID code 1hjr; Ariyoshi et al., 1994) (Figure 2). RuvC contains five strands and 5 helices in the following order: 1(2-7)-2(12-21)-3(24-34)-1(40-58)-4(6267)-2(77-92)-5(98-102)-3(103-110)-4(118-128)5(140-151). Superposition of the alpha carbon atoms for 72 residues within all the regular secondary structure elements of YqgF with the corresponding regions of RuvC resulted a RMSD of 3.0 Å. While the regions of the 1-2-3-1-4-2-5 fold from both proteins are structurally equivalent, the third helix of YqgF (3) superimposed with the fifth helix of RuvC (5). Sequence identity and similarity between these two proteins are 13% and 27%, respectively (Figure 2b). The region of YqgF that corresponds to helices 3 and 4 of RuvC does not align well and is unstructured (Figures 1 and 2). Asp 7, Asp 141 and Glu 66 are three acidic amino acids believed to be active site residues in RuvC. As predicted by Aravind et al., 2000, Asp9 and Asp122 of YqgF can structurally be superimposed with the corresponding active site residues, Asp 7 and Asp141 of RuvC; the distances between the C carbon atoms for each pair of residues are less then 2 Å. However, Glu 96 of YqgF does not superimpose well with the third RuvC active site residue, Glu 66; the distance between their C atoms is larger than 7 Å. Almost all known Holliday junction resolvases form dimers, such as RuvC (Ariyoshi et al., 1994), T4 endonuclease VII (Raaijmakers et al., 1999), archaeal Holliday junction resolvase Hjc (Nishino et al., 2001) and yeast mitochondrial Holliday junction resolvase Ydc2 (Ceschini et al., 2001). The dimeric form of the protein is required for proper binding to the Holliday junction DNA structure and for the introduction of paired nicks on opposing strands of the four-way DNA junction substrate (Bond et al., 2001). However, YqgF is likely a monomer in solution. An overall isotropic rotational correlation time of 10.5-ns was obtained for YqgF is consistent with YqgF being a 15 kDa monomeric protein in solution (Maciejewski et al., 2000). This is further supported by the apparent molecular mass of 17 kDa as determined by size exclusion chromatography experiments (data not shown). Therefore, the biochemical and structural data presented here suggest that, although YqgF structurally resembles RuvC, it is less likely to function as a Holliday junction resolvase. Functional studies using standard Holliday junction cleavage and DNA binding assays will be required to confirm this hypothesis.
