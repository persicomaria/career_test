We report here the first crystal structure of a stable isosteric analogue of 1,3-bisphospho-D-glyceric acid (1,3-BPGA) bound to the catalytic domain of Trypanosoma cruzi glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) in which the two phosphoryl moieties interact with Arg249. This complex possibly illustrates a step of the catalytic process by which Arg249 may induce compression of the product formed, allowing its expulsion from the active site. Structural modifications were introduced into this isosteric analogue and the respective inhibitory effects of the resulting diphosphorylated compounds on T. cruzi and

Trypanosoma brucei gGAPDHs were investigated by enzymatic inhibition studies, fluorescence spectroscopy, sitedirected mutagenesis, and molecular modelling. Despite the high homology between the two trypanomastid gGAPDHs (> 95%), we have identified specific interactions that could be used to design selective irreversible inhibitors against T. cruzi gGAPDH. Keywords: 1,3-bisphospho-D-glyceric acid isosteric analogue; drug design; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH); Trypanosoma cruzi.

Trypanosomatids are flagellated protozoan parasites responsible for serious diseases in humans (sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, leishmaniases) and domestic animals in tropical and subtropical regions. Today, the medical and economic problems caused by the trypanosomiases represent a formidable obstacle to the development of many African and South American countries and rank among the first tropical diseases selected by the World Health Organization to develop new or more effective treatments [1]. Owing to toxicity and lack of efficacy, most of the compounds currently used for chemotherapy are unsatisfactory and the design of novel classes of antitrypanosomatid drugs has become urgent. Glycolysis plays an

important role in all human-infective Trypanosomatidae and is, in some members of this family, the only process providing ATP to the cell. Therefore, this pathway is considered a good target for drugs against the trypanosomiases and leishmaniases [2]. Studies of energy metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei have established that, unlike the insect form, the bloodstream form depends solely on glycolysis for energy production [3]. Biochemical studies with the Trypanosoma cruzi axenic amastigote intracellular form also suggest that carbohydrate catabolism is its major source of energy [4]. The glycolytic pathway of these parasites is unique in that most of its enzymes are present in peroxisome-like organelles called glycosomes. Our current work focuses on the glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) as a target for inhibitor design. This enzyme has proven to be a promising target because of several significant features of its involvement in the glycolytic process. (a) Computer simulation of glycolysis in bloodstream-form T. brucei suggested that, even by the partial inhibition of its activity, this enzyme may have significant control over the glycolytic flux and thus significantly reduce the ATP supply of the parasite [5­7]. (b) From the fact that a 95% deficiency of GAPDH in human erythrocytes does not cause any clinical symptoms, it was inferred that the enzyme in these blood cells has a low level of flux control; significant differences in flux control between the corresponding enzymes of parasite and host cells would provide additional selectivity to drugs [8]. (c) The sequestering of the glycolytic pathway inside glycosomes has led to the endowment of unique kinetic and

structural properties to several of its enzymes [2], including GAPDH [9]. (d) The possible selectivity of drugs has been proven with adenosine analogues which kill bloodstreamform T. brucei amastigotes within a few minutes without affecting the growth of fibroblasts [10,11]. GAPDH catalyses the oxidation and phosphorylation of D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) to 1,3-bisphospho-Dglyceric acid (1,3-BPGA) in the presence of NAD+ and inorganic phosphate. The forward reaction mechanism has been extensively investigated [12­15] but the reverse reaction mechanism with 1,3-BPGA as substrate has not yet been clarified. Despite the large number of crystallographically determined 3D structures of GAPDHs from several organisms [16­29], there is none giving the detailed position of the substrate 1,3-BPGA in the active site during catalysis. This has rendered the mechanistic approach and the design of inhibitors such as 1,3-BPGA analogues far from easy. Indeed, the most potent and selective inhibitors of gGAPDH from parasites (T. brucei, Leishmania mexicana, T. cruzi) described to date are mainly adenosine analogues [10,11]. In order to design specific inhibitors for trypanomastid glycosomal GAPDHs, we are developing a new family of 1,3-BPGA substrate analogues. In the first step, to mimic the enzyme­substrate complex as closely as possible, we synthesized a stable molecule [3(R)-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phosphonoxybutyl]phosphonic acid (HOP), with the highest similarity to the natural substrate 1,3-BPGA. We report here the refined crystal structure of a complex between the T. cruzi gGAPDH and this substrate isosteric analogue. On the basis of this crystal structure, we were able to design selective inhibitors for T. brucei and T. cruzi gGAPDHs that had no effect on rabbit muscle GAPDH, the mammalian enzyme used as a model of human GAPDH. Kinetic studies, site-directed mutagenesis, fluorescence spectroscopy, and molecular modelling were used to further characterize the specific binding modes of these 1,3-BPGA analogues to the two trypanosomatid enzymes.

31 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon. The total volume of the amplification mixture was 50 lL containing 1 lg genomic DNA, 100 pmol each primer, 200 mM each of the four nucleotides, and 1 lL Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the corresponding reaction buffer. PCR was carried out using the following programme: first 3 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C; a final incubation of 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into the vector pET15b (Novagen). The new recombinant plasmid named pET15b-TbGAPDH directs, under the control of the T7 promoter, the production of a fusion protein bearing an N-terminal extension of 20 residues including a (His)6 tag. Site-directed mutagenesis of T. brucei gGAPDH Site-directed mutagenesis of the T. brucei gGAPDH gene was performed on plasmid pET15b-TbGAPDH using PCR techniques as described by Mikaelian & Sergeant [33] and using the Vent DNA polymerase. The T. brucei gGAPDH Thr196 ACA codon was changed into the Ala codon GCA, and the Thr225 codon ACT was changed into the Ala codon GCT. The mutagenized GAPDH gene fragments were then excised from the plasmid by digestion with SalI and SacI and used to replace the corresponding segment in the original plasmid containing the wild-type gene. Mutagenized plasmids were then checked by sequencing before they were introduced into Escherichia coli for gene expression. Overexpression and purification of wild-type and mutant T. brucei gGAPDH T. brucei wild-type and mutated gGAPDH were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the bacteriophage T7-RNA polymerase system [34]. E. coli cells containing the wild-type plasmid pET15b-TbGAPDH or its mutant derivatives were grown in 50 mL Luria­Bertani medium supplemented with 100 lgÆmL)1 ampicillin. Expression was induced at an A600 of 0.5­0.8 by addition of 1 mM isopropyl thio-b-D-galactoside, and growth was continued overnight at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (10 000 g, 10 min at 4 °C). The cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL lysis buffer (0.05 M triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 lM leupeptin, 1 lM pepstatin and 1 lM E64). Cells were lysed by two passages through an SML-Aminco French pressure cell at 5516 kPa. Nucleic acids were removed first by incubation with 100 U Benzonase (Merck) for 30 min at 37 °C, and then with 5 mg protamine sulfate for 15 min at room temperature. The lysate was centrifuged (10 000 g, 15 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant used for purification of recombinant enzyme by immobilized metalaffinity chromatography (Talon resin; Clontech) using the (His)6 tag at the N-terminus of gGAPDH. The charged resin was first washed with lysis buffer plus 5 mM imidazole, then with lysis buffer plus 10 mM imidazole. The enzyme was subsequently eluted (1-mL fractions) with 100 mM imidazole in lysis buffer and stored at 4 °C in the elution buffer. T. brucei gGAPDH expressed in E. coli could be purified to homogeneity, as assessed by SDS/PAGE, with a

Materials and methods
Sources of substrates, cofactors and inhibitors The synthesis of 1,3-BPGA analogues used in this study has been described elsewhere [30­32]. NADH, NAD+, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), ATP, rabbit muscle GAPDH and yeast phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) were purchased from Sigma. GAP was prepared by hydrolysis of the diethylacetal ester according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma). Cloning of the T. brucei gGAPDH into an expression vector The T. brucei gGAPDH gene was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following specific oligonucleotides: a sense primer 5¢-CAACAAATTTGCATATGACTATT AAAG-3¢ containing an NdeI site (underlined) next to the start codon of the T. brucei gGAPDH gene; an antisense primer 5¢-CAGCCAAGCGCCTAGGGAGCGAGA AC-3¢, containing a BamHI site (underlined) and starting

yield of 1.7 mg from a 50-mL culture of recombinant bacteria. Preparation and purification of T. cruzi gGAPDH T. cruzi gGAPDH was expressed in E. coli and purified following the previously reported procedure [24]. No dithiothreitol was used in the purification buffer to avoid any reaction with the inhibitors. Co-crystallization assays Co-crystallization assays were carried out using a protein solution at 10 mgÆmL)1 preincubated with 2 mM inhibitor. Crystals of the complex gGAPDH­HOP were grown at 18 °C by hanging drop vapour diffusion, against a reservoir solution of 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3­7.5, with 0.1 M calcium acetate, 18% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM sodium azide. The crystallization droplets were prepared with equal volumes of gGAPDH solution (5 lL) and reservoir buffer (5 lL). Flat small crystals appeared within 2 weeks. Data collection and processing A single crystal of gGAPDH­HOP complex was flashcooled to 100 K in an Oxford Cryostream Cooler. The cryoprotectant solution used consisted of 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 400 added to the above described reservoir solution. Monochromatic X-ray data collection was performed at the Brazilian National Synchrotron Light ° Laboratory (LNLS) [35] using 1.54 A as the incident wavelength. Diffraction spots were recorded on a MAR345 image plate using the oscillation method [36]. Data indexing and scaling were carried out with DENZO and SCALEPACK software, respectively [37]. Data collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. The crystals belong to the space group P21 with unit cell ° ° ° parameters a ¼ 81.76 A, b ¼ 85.20 A, c ¼ 106.42 A and b ¼ 96.74°. Analysis of the crystal content reveals one tetramer per asymmetric unit, and a Vm value of ° 2.21 A3ÆDa)1. The solvent content of the crystal is 47.4% (v/v).

tetrameric gGAPDH structure without cofactor and water molecules was used as the search model. AMoRe provided a clear Fourier solution, with correlation coefficient of 69.7% and Rfactor ¼ 0.318. The rotated and translated model was refined with the CNS suite of programs [39] using torsional molecular dynamics and maximum likelihood functions. The crystallographic Rfactor and Rfree values, as well as the stereochemical quality of the model, were monitored throughout the refinement with the program PROCHECK [40], and, whenever necessary, model building and computer graphics visualization were performed with the O software [41]. Analysis of difference maps in the active site of all monomers revealed clear electron density for the NAD cofactors included in the model. After several cycles of manual rebuilding and conjugated gradient minimization, 441 water molecules were added to the model using the program ARP [42]. Subsequent analysis of the difference Fourier map (Fo ) Fc) showed reasonable density for the inhibitor in the active site of monomer A (Fig. 1). At this point, one molecule of HOP was manually built into the A subunit and the whole structure was further refined to the final Rfactor of 0.193 and the Rfree of 0.261. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. Assay of enzyme activities The activity of gGAPDH was assayed in both directions by spectrophotometrically monitoring the oxidation/reduction of NAD(H). In the forward (glycolytic) reaction, this could be done directly by following the formation of NADH by GAPDH, using the substrate GAP at a saturating concentration of 0.8 mM (Km ¼ 150 lM) [43]. For the reverse (gluconeogenic) reaction, in which NADH oxidation was followed, a coupled assay system involving PGK was used to produce the substrate 1,3-BPGA. The assay mixture (1 mL) contained 0.1 M triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.6), 1 mM EDTA, 5.6 mM 3-PGA, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM MgSO4, 0.42 mM NADH and a large excess of yeast PGK (11 U). All reactions were carried out at 25 °C. The reaction was monitored by the absorbance change of NADH at 340 nm with a Perkin­Elmer spectrophotometer equipped with a kinetic accessory unit. Initial reaction rates were calculated from the slopes of the curves recorded during the first 3 min of the reaction and from the NADH concentrations using the value e340 ¼ 6.22 mM)1Æcm)1. Inhibition studies The inhibitory activities of ligands on enzymes (wild-type and mutants) were measured after preincubation of the enzyme with the compound for 5 min followed by addition of the reaction mixture to start the reaction. A possible effect of the inhibitors on the absorbance of NADH was checked. The concentration of inhibitor required for 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated from the percentage of remaining enzyme activity by comparison with an inhibitorfree control experiment and based on measurements at five different inhibitor concentrations. This was carried out for the reaction in both directions, each with its substrate at saturating concentration. The inhibition pattern and inhibition constants (Ki) were determined from Lineweaver­ Burk plots. The inhibition with respect to 1,3-BPGA was

intensities at 330 nm were used. Absorbance and excitation spectra were recorded in the range 200­350 nm, and the fluorescence spectra were recorded between 270 nm and 450 nm. All fluorescence studies were performed in 0.1 M triethanolamine/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) with a GAPDH concentration of 6.5 lM and variable quencher concentrations of 0­250 mM. Quenching data were analysed by a least squares fit to the Stern­Volmer equation: I0 =I ¼ 1 þ KSV ½Q where I0 and I are fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of quencher Q, and KSV is the Stern­Volmer constant. Estimates of KSV were obtained by using linear regression analysis with MICROCAL ORIGIN 4.00 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, PA, USA). Molecular modelling Modelling studies of the binary enzyme­inhibitor complexes were performed with the INSIGHT II/DISCOVER program (Insight II User Guide, version 2000; Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), using molecular mechanics (consistent valor force field, CVFF), conjugate gradient minimization algorithm (CG) and implicit solvation conditions (water, e ¼ 80). The crystal structure of the T. cruzi gGAPDH­ HOP complex was used as a framework on which all other inhibitors were built into gGAPDH's active site. Furthermore, the gGAPDH­HOP complex was superimposed on the T. brucei structure. Because T. cruzi and T. brucei gGAPDHs have highly similar active sites, the conformation of HOP inside the T. brucei active site was energy minimized and used as a framework for further modelling studies. Compounds 5, 6, 7 and 8 were built from the framework of HOP, and energy minimized as described

studied at four different concentrations of 1,3-BPGA, which was produced by PGK auxiliary enzyme. The amount of 1,3-BPGA for the assay was directly proportional to the amount of ATP used by PGK to convert 3-PGA into 1,3BPGA. The inhibition kinetics studies were performed with four different concentrations of ATP (250, 350, 500 and 600 lM), which correspond to 1,3-BPGA concentrations of 2­5 times the Km value of this substrate for GAPDH. Fluorescence measurements All fluorescence spectra were made at 20 °C in 4 mL clearsided cuvettes using a Perkin­Elmer LS-50B computer controlled rationing luminescence spectrometer, equipped with a xenon discharge lamp, Monk­Gillieson type monochromators (excitation 200­800 nm, zero-order selectable; emission 200­900 nm, zero-order selectable), and a gated photomultiplier detector. For solute quenching, tryptophan was excited at 295 nm to avoid phenylalanine and tyrosine fluorescence. Excitation and emission spectra were recorded between 310 and 360 nm with excitation and emission slits set at 5 nm. For determination of dissociation constants,

above. For all these local minimum energy configurations, semiempirical quantum chemical calculations were performed in water, using the Austin model 1 (AM1) Hamiltonian. The electrostatic potential atomic charges (MOPAC keyword ESP) obtained from these single point calculations were used to superimpose the four structures on the basis of their field similarities, using the INSIGHT II/ SEARCH/COMPARE program. The orientations of each compound with respect to that of HOP were used as input for further optimizations, which were carried out inside the T. cruzi gGAPDH active site. During these simulations, T. cruzi gGAPDH atoms were kept constrained and inhibitor atoms were allowed to move freely within the active site. The same protocol was applied to T. brucei gGAPDH modelling studies.

Results
3D structure of the T. cruzi gGAPDH­HOP complex Quality of the structure (RCSB PDB accession No. 1QXS). Despite the lack of NCS restraints during the refinement process, the electron-density maps calculated from the gGAPDH­HOP complex show good quality. This is not the case for surface loops comprising residues 65­74, 99­103 and 117­121 in monomer C and 99­102 in monomer B and several residues at the N-terminus and C-terminus, which are poorly resolved. The stereochemistry of the structure is generally quite satisfactory, with more than 99% of the residues showing torsion angles in the favourable regions of the Ramachandran diagram [45]. Only Val255 from all monomers are in unfavourable regions. Val255 is located in a loop between two consecutive b strands. The unfavourable conformation observed for this

residue is conserved in all other GAPDH structures available [16,18,19,22,24­29] and seems important to maintain the correct positioning of the active residue Cys166 and the nicotinamide ring of the NAD+ cofactor during catalysis. The average isotropic temperature factor values for the main chain and all atoms of the 359 residues from ° ° each monomer are, respectively, 43.5 A2 and 43.8 A2 in ° ° ° monomer A, 46.8 A2 and 47.1 A2 in monomer B, 51.6 A2 ° 2 in monomer C, and 43.2 A2 and 43.5 A2 in ° ° and 51.9 A monomer D. It is not uncommon to find partial occupancy of T. cruzi gGAPDH active sites by ligands [28,29]. In the structure described here, the inhibitor is present in only one of the four subunits of the enzyme. This observation suggests that, in solution, the enzyme­inhibitor complexes have a distribution of populations with different numbers of subunits occupied by the inhibitor. This would result in asymmetric particles that would be subsequently selected during the crystallization process to predominantly accommodate one particular conformer in the crystal lattice. gGAPDH­HOP interaction profile. The analysis of the complex (Fig. 1) reveals that the phosphate moiety is positioned in the so-called Ps binding site [25], where it hydrogen bonds to Thr197, Thr199 and Arg249 (Fig. 2). The position of this phosphate group is in good agreement with the previously reported Ps position for the sulfate and phosphate ions in the crystal structures of T. brucei and ° L. mexicana gGAPDHs (1.11 and 0.48 A, respectively) (Fig. 3A). The phosphonate moiety in the gGAPDH­HOP complex binds to a phosphate-binding site not previously described. Its main interactions are with residues Ser247 and ° ° Arg249. In this novel position, it lies 5.38 A and 4.06 A from the previously reported Pi position for sulfate and

However, this new phosphonate-binding site is very close to one that we recently identified in the crystal structure of T. cruzi gGAPDH complexed with a GAP analogue [29] (Fig. 3B). In this structure, the phosphonate moiety was interacting with residues Arg295 and Thr226 ° but was 3.35 A from the Pi position described for

L. mexicana gGAPDH. In the structure reported here, the ° phosphonate is 0.90 A from the phosphonate position in the gGAPDH­thioester complex (Fig. 3B). It should also be stressed that the hydroxy group in the C2 position with the R configuration as in the substrate does not make any important interactions with residues of the active site of T. cruzi gGAPDH.

Considering the resolution of the data, both possible orientations for HOP phosphoryl groups were assessed during the refinement protocol (phosphate or phosphonate moiety interacting at the Ps site). The orientation shown in Fig. 1 was chosen because it fitted the Fo ) Fc electrondensity map much better than the inverted conformation. Indeed we noticed that the C3 hydroxy moiety could not fit the electron-density map in the inverted conformation (data not shown). Inhibition of T. cruzi gGAPDH Inhibitor design. All structures of 1,3-BPGA analogues are given in Table 3. Inhibitors were designed from the reference compound 2-oxo-1,5-diphosphonopentane (5); its structure retains the overall size, the two phosphoryl

moieties, and the carbonyl at the C3 position of the natural substrate. Based on this scaffold, structural diversity was introduced to retain a high similarity to 1,3-BPGA: the phosphate group and hydroxy group in the C2 position were maintained (compounds 2, 3 and 4) with the aim of assessing their contribution to affinity. Then, to improve the affinity of compound 5, a series of chemical modifications were performed on the b-ketophosphonate motif. The introduction of one or two fluorine atoms on the a-methylene group increased the acidity of the phosphonate, from 7.6 to 6.5 giving a pKa identical with that of the phosphate moiety [46] (compounds 6 and 7). The introduction of a nitrogen atom to replace the methylene group was also considered for its potential to hydrogen bond with the enzyme active site (compound 8).

Inhibition studies. Table 3 summarizes the inhibitory effects of these compounds on T. cruzi gGAPDH with respect to GAP and 1,3-BPGA. In both assays, these substrates were present at saturating concentrations. In the inhibition assays of the reverse reaction, a coupledenzyme assay system was used in which the reaction of GAPDH was initiated by an excess of yeast PGK producing the substrate 1,3-BPGA. Possible effects of inhibitors on yeast PGK activity were checked by running the enzymatic reaction of PGK alone. At the highest concentration of inhibitor (10 mM), no significant effect on the enzyme activity was detected. Compounds HOP, 2 and 3, which have the greatest structural similarity to 1,3BPGA and bear either a hydroxy group on C3 or a phosphate group on C1, interacted with both GAP and 1,3-BPGA binding sites. However, they were completely nonselective with regard to both substrates. Surprisingly, the 1,3-BPGA isosteric analogue HOP proved to be the weakest inhibitor (IC50 ¼ 2 mM). These results show clearly that close structural similarity to 1,3-BPGA is associated with decreased affinity and selectivity. Compounds 5­8, 1,5-diphosphonopentanes without a substituent at the C2 position, appeared to be selective inhibitors of T. cruzi gGAPDH with respect to 1,3-BPGA. No inhibition was detected with respect to GAP at a 5 mM concentration of inhibitor. This result parallels similar selective and specific inhibition of T. brucei gGAPDH by the same molecules (Table 4), as described in a previous report [30]. This result led us to investigate further the behaviour of both proteins with regard to these substrate analogues.

Inhibition and site-directed mutagenesis of T. brucei gGAPDH In the absence of a 3D structure of a complex of T. brucei gGAPDH with an analogue of 1,3-BPGA, we chose to investigate the enzyme­inhibitor interactions by studying the kinetics of enzymatic inactivation with the native protein and with two proteins modified by site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetics studies of T. brucei gGAPDH. Table 5 gives the inhibition constants (Ki) of the different compounds determined for the T. brucei enzyme. The inhibition kinetics data with respect to 1,3-BPGA were calculated from Lineweaver­Burk plots (1/v vs. 1/[substrate]) with an intercept on the 1/v axis, at any concentration of inhibitor (data not shown). All compounds were fully competitive with respect to 1,3-BPGA, indicating a clear interaction at this substrate-binding site. The inhibition constants found for compounds 5, 6 and 7 were in the range of the Km values for 1,3-BPGA and even up to three times lower for compound 6. Selection of T. brucei gGAPDH residues to be mutated and measurement of kinetic parameters of the mutated enzyme forms. Residues Thr196 and Thr225 (which correspond to Thr197 and Thr226, respectively, in T. cruzi gGAPDH) were selected for the following reasons. (a) They are involved in the two phosphate­anion binding sites: Thr225 in the Pi site (for inorganic phosphate-binding site) and Thr196 in the Ps site (for the GAP C3-phosphatebinding site) which were identified in the 3D structures of both the T. brucei and T. cruzi enzymes. (b) Results from a mutagenesis study involving the whole set of residues constituting these phosphate-binding sites in the Bacillus stearothermophilus enzyme [47] allowed us to select the amino acids the substitution of which does not result in the total suppression of catalytic activity; threonines were selected because mutation of arginine involved in both Pi and Ps sites almost entirely abolished the enzyme's activity (for mutations at the Ps site), rendering any study of the inhibitory effect impossible. (c) Substitution of threonine residues by alanines was preferred to the isosteric Thr­Val substitution, to avoid hypothetical hydrophobic interactions and to enable direct comparison between T. brucei and B. stearothermophilus mutants. The kinetic parameters of the wild-type enzymes and the various mutants from the two organisms (B. stearothermophilus [47] and T. brucei) are summarized in Table 6. With all mutants, and for both organisms, a decrease in kcat for the forward reaction was observed. For T. brucei, however, and unlike B. stearothermophilus GAPDH, these decreases were more pronounced with the Pi mutant (Thr225Ala: 0.4% activity remaining) than the Ps mutant (Thr196Ala: 9% activity remaining). For the trypanosome enzyme, Km for 1,3-BPGA and GAP increased significantly in the Pi mutant; in the Ps mutant, Km for GAP increased when the Km of 1,3-BPGA stayed constant. This unchanged Km parallels similar effects observed in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme: a decrease in Km for GAP was reported [47] for threonine replacement in both Pi and Ps mutants, but no explanation was given to account for these observations.

Enzymatic inactivation studies were carried out on the two mutated T. brucei gGAPDHs in the presence of compounds HOP, 5, 6, 7 and 8. When all the 1,3-BPGA analogues were inhibiting T. brucei gGAPDH with IC50 between 65 and 2000 lM, no inhibitory effect was detected on either mutant enzyme (data not shown), even at very high inhibitor concentrations (up to 5 mM). These results indicate that modifications at either the Pi or Ps site completely abolished the inhibitory effect of these substrate analogues. This is consistent with a simultaneous interaction of the 1,3BPGA analogues at both Ps and Pi phosphate-binding sites. Comparison of the inhibition of T. cruzi and T. brucei gGAPDHs Inhibition. Table 4 summarizes the inhibitory effects (IC50) of the glycosomal GAPDHs from T. brucei and T. cruzi by 1,3-BPGA analogues which are inactive on rabbit muscle

GAPDH. Strikingly, although the homology between these two proteins is greater than 95%, different inhibitory effects were observed for these two enzymes: the 1,5-diphosphonopentanes proved to be between 2 and 30 times more active on T. brucei gGAPDH than they were on T. cruzi gGAPDH. The most significant differences were obtained with compounds 6 and 7 which bear two and one fluorine atoms on the C1 position, respectively. HOP, which had the closest structural similarity to the substrate 1,3-BPGA, had the same poor effect on both proteins. Affinity values. For the T. brucei enzyme, the dissociation constants (Kd in Table 5) of all molecules, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, were very close to the Ki values (Ki in Table 5) measured by inhibition kinetics. Therefore, these values were in the range of the substrate's Km, or even lower for fluorinated compounds 6 and 7. Surprisingly, nonfluorinated molecules 5 and 8 have very similar Kd values for both

the T. brucei and T. cruzi proteins. These Kd values actually represent the ligand affinities for a nonactive conformation of the enzyme in the absence of substrate and cofactor. Molecular modelling. To elucidate the different behaviour of these inhibitors on the two trypanosomatid gGAPDHs, modelling studies of enzyme­inhibitor complexes were performed using Search/Compare and Discover modules from the Insight II package. Interestingly, despite the fact that the two proteins exhibit a high degree of homology, modelling studies showed different behaviours for 1,3BPGA analogues inside the T. cruzi and T. brucei gGAPDH active sites, as depicted in Fig. 4. For T. cruzi gGAPDH, although the rmsd was greater in the Ps binding site, molecular modelling results (Fig. 4A) suggest that most inhibitors interact with the same residues as HOP. A particularly good result was found for compound 8, the most active compound against T. cruzi gGAPDH. Modelling results suggest that improved activity of this compound may be a result of hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl of Thr167 of the protein and the amino group of compound 8. No other inhibitor offered such an interaction. For compounds 5­8, the interaction of one phosphonate group at the Ps site may be responsible for the inhibitory effect with respect to 1,3-BPGA. However, no strong interaction with the Pi site was found. As this Pi site was recently proposed to be the first binding site of GAP [26,29], the absence of interactions at this site may explain the inactivity of compounds 5­8 with respect to GAP. T. brucei gGAPDH inhibitors show lower rmsd (Fig. 4) and a more bent conformation than T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitors. In other words, the average value of interphosphate distances for T. cruzi gGAPDH inhibitors is larger ° (6.87 A) than the average value found for the T. brucei ° gGAPDH inhibitors (6.40 A) (Table 7). In fact, if interphosphate distances are plotted against IC50 values, an inverted-bell shape correlation becomes apparent for both T. brucei and T. cruzi gGAPDHs. This behaviour supports the view that an ideal distance is required to obtain maximal inhibitory activity. Despite great sequence conservation in the active site of the two trypanosomatid gGAPDHs, two minor structural differences may be responsible for the extended/bent conformation of inhibitors inside the active site: (a) substitution of Ser247 in T. cruzi gGAPDH by Ala246 in T. brucei gGAPDH; (b) different conformations adopted by Thr226/Thr225 in the two gGAPDHs. In T. cruzi gGAPDH, Ser247 and Thr226 compete with Arg249 for the phosphate groups in the inhibitors, thus Arg249 attracts them less strongly, allowing the inhibitors to adopt an extended conformation. In T. brucei gGAPDH, Arg248 is the main residue that interacts with these phosphate groups, once Ala246 does not have a suitable side chain and Thr225 is not oriented to interact with the inhibitors. A possible consequence of this interaction profile is the bent conformation of inhibitors in the T. brucei enzyme suggested by modelling studies.

Discussion
HOP was selected as a starting point for our inhibitor design studies, because its molecular structure has the closest

similarity to the substrate 1,3-BPGA, keeping the overall size, the two phosphoryl moieties, the carbonyl at the C2 position and the (R) configuration at the C3 carbon bearing the hydroxy group. Because of the low stability of the mixed anhydride present in 1,3-BPGA (t½ ¼ 30 s) [48], this moiety was replaced by a b-ketophosphonate structure which is stable and not hydrolysable. The crystal structure reported here provides the first view of the closest 1,3BPGA analogue bound to the catalytic domain of a GAPDH, with its two phosphoryl groups making a number of specific interactions. The two phosphoryl moieties of HOP are bound to Arg249, a specific residue allegedly belonging to the Ps binding site, which serves as a linker between the phosphoryl groups of HOP. This ionic bridge induces a deformation bending of the analogue (no extended conformation between either Pi or Ps sites). This complex possibly illustrates a step of the catalytic process by which, after the phosphorylation step, Arg249 may induce compression of the product, to set it on its way for expulsion from the active site (or its introduction into the active site of the substrate in the reverse reaction). In this binary complex, the hydroxy group on C3 does not interact with residues of the active site, and all molecules bearing this OH are inhibitors with respect to both substrates. This hydroxy group is known to play an essential role in orientating the substrate GAP or 1,3-BPGA for the first step of the enzymatic process by keeping its D conformation [26]. Our observations suggest that the substrate analogue is probably located elsewhere on the pathway of the multistep catalysis, where the OH interactions with residues of the active site are not required. Using information on the 3D structure of the enzyme­ inhibitor complex, we introduced structural modifications in HOP and determined the respective inhibitory effects of the resulting compounds on the T. cruzi gGAPDH. Activity assays showed two different behaviour patterns for these inhibitors. First, the derivatives with the closest structural homology to the substrate behaved as inhibitors with respect to both substrates (GAP and 1,3-BPGA) and were completely nonselective as they inhibited the trypanosome and mammalian (rabbit muscle GAPDH) enzymes equally well [30]. Secondly, the 2-oxo-diphosphonopentanes 5, 6, 7 and 8 were only inhibitors with respect to 1,3-BPGA and had no effect on the mammalian enzyme. However, the presence of one or two fluorine atoms on the b-ketophosphonate moiety (compounds 6 and 7), rendering the ionic interactions of the phosphonate group similar to those of the equivalent phosphate, did not improve the inhibition or the affinity. With a nitrogen atom (compound 8), however, a slightly additive inhibition and a good affinity (Kd value, Table 5) were observed. These same molecules displayed different inhibitory effects (IC50) and affinity constants (Kd) with T. brucei gGAPDH (Table 4). These differences were unexpected as the proteins have very similar sequences and superimposable 3D structures [24]. Parallel studies of these effects allowed identification of the specific interactions between the inhibitors and the proteins. In the absence of a 3D structure for the enzyme from T. brucei complexed with an analogue of 1,3-BPGA, we could not directly identify the structural features that account for the difference between the two enzymes. Therefore, other approaches were used.

First, for T. brucei gGAPDH, complete kinetic studies were performed to identify residues in the Pi and Ps binding sites. The results of these studies were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of specific residues of the two sites. Secondly, model building of the best inhibitors based on the refined structures of the two trypanosomatid GAPDHs strongly suggests that the contacts responsible for the inhibitory effects are different for the two proteins. Indeed, the modelling studies performed on the T. brucei enzyme showed that inhibitors are likely to be more bent than in the T. cruzi gGAPDH active site (Fig. 4). Therefore the electrostatic effects of the charges borne by the phosphonate moiety of the inhibitors become more significant with the former enzyme, and the more acidic group-bearing inhibitors 6 and 7 are the most efficient. For T. cruzi GAPDH, our results are clearly correlated with a more extended conformation of the inhibitors (Table 7), accounting for weaker electrostatic interactions with Arg249; they also suggest an interaction of Thr167 through a specific hydrogen bond with the amino group of the b-ketophosphonate moiety in compound 8. These findings will be taken into account in the design of the next generation of GAPDH inhibitors, particularly with respect to shape, charges and substituents. We will now focus on two strategic targets: (a) the methylene group of the b-ketophosphonate moiety for future modifications of molecules; (b) Thr167, close to the essential Cys166 (in T. cruzi) at the Pi binding site, to improve selective irreversible inhibitors previously considered [49] against T. cruzi gGAPDH. Analysis of the effects in terms of interactions between these selective inhibitors and the proteins has allowed us to identify specific interactions with the trypanomastid gGAPDHs that may account for the differences in behaviour of the two proteins despite their great similarity. Other factors may also be of some importance, including the conformational change of the protein. Indeed, besides the large differences observed between Ki and Kd values (Table 5), we have previously shown by kinetic analysis [49] that, during irreversible enzyme inhibition, T. brucei gGAPDH undergoes a conformational change before covalent binding. The actual difference between these enzymes may arise from their ability to involve different conformational changes in the presence of these inhibitors. A Fourier transform infrared study is in progress.
