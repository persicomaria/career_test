Efforts to identify a suitable follow-on compound to razaxaban (compound 4) focused on modification of the carboxamido linker to eliminate potential in vivo hydrolysis to a primary aniline. Cyclization of the carboxamido linker to the novel bicyclic tetrahydropyrazolopyridinone scaffold retained the potent fXa binding activity. Exceptional potency of the series prompted an investigation of the neutral P1 moieties that resulted in the identification of the p-methoxyphenyl P1, which retained factor Xa binding affinity and good oral bioavailability. Further optimization of the C-3 pyrazole position and replacement of the terminal P4 ring with a neutral heterocycle culminated in the discovery of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-7-oxo-6-(4-(2-oxopiperidin1-yl)phenyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-3-carboxamide (apixaban, compound 40). Compound 40 exhibits a high degree of fXa potency, selectivity, and efficacy and has an improved pharmacokinetic profile relative to 4.
Introduction Thrombotic diseases remain the leading cause of death in developed countries despite the availability of anticoagulants such as warfarin,1a-c heparin and low molecular weight heparins,2,3 and antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel. The oral anticoagulant warfarin inhibits the post-translational maturation of coagulation factors VII, IX, and X and prothrombin and has proven effective in both venous and arterial thrombosis. However, warfarin's usage is limited because of its narrow therapeutic index, slow onset of therapeutic effect, numerous dietary and drug interactions, and a need for monitoring and dose adjustment.4a,b This not withstanding, warfarin remains the standard orally administered anticoagulant available in the United States. Patients on warfarin therapy require regular monitoring in part because of its narrow therapeutic index and interactions with food and other drugs. Injectable agents that are also widely used include low molecular weight heparins and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux.5 Thus, discovering and developing safe and efficacious oral anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of a wider range of thrombotic diseases has become increasingly important. A key strategy for the discovery and development of new anticoagulants has been the targeting of specific enzymes within the blood coagulation cascade. One approach is to inhibit thrombin generation by targeting the inhibition of coagulation factor Xa (fXa).5,6a-h Factor Xa, a trypsin-like serine protease, is crucial to the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade that is responsible for fibrin clot formation. Preclinical animal models have suggested that inhibiting fXa has the potential for providing excellent antithrombotic efficacy with minimal bleeding risk when compared to direct thrombin inhibitors.6a-g Recent disclosures from clinical studies with direct fXa inhibitors such as compound

5000 nM).7a Compounds 2 and 4 were advanced to clinical trials. Subsequently, compound 4 was further advanced to a phase II trial for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after knee replacement surgery and was shown to be highly efficacious when compared to enoxaparin.7c Consistent with our strategy of developing and advancing key follow-on candidates, our focus was directed toward the identification of novel entities that would be significantly differentiated from previous candidates in terms of improving on potential liabilities of earlier compounds. A common structural feature that is present with compound 4 and its predecessor candidates was the presence of the 5-carboxamido linker that connects the pyrazole scaffold to the P4 moiety. In the advancement of potential candidates for preclinical evaluations, it was necessary to determine the susceptibility of the amide linker to metabolic cleavage because this could potentially liberate a aniline fragment. Fortunately, for compound 4 and its predecessor clinical compound 2 the amide linker was stable to metabolic hydrolysis; however, this was not the case with our preclinical compound 3, which liberated the biarylamino group at a higher pH. In the bacterial reverse mutation (AMES)13 assay, the aniline moiety of 3 tested positive, which was further

confirmed in follow-up assays for mutagenicity.14 Therefore, as part of our optimization strategy, we sought to modify the carboxamido portion of the molecule to obviate the need for mutagenicity studies on potential aniline degradants. Toward this end, we recently disclosed several series of bicyclic pyrazole scaffolds15a-c,16a in which the carboxamido linker was cyclized into the pyrazole ring, some of which showed similar or better fXa potency compared with the previously disclosed monocyclic pyrazole analogues.7a,b,11 The optimization strategy with the bicyclic pyrazole scaffold led to the identification of BMS740808 (compound 5, fXa Ki ) 0.03 nM, trypsin Ki > 5000 nM, Figure 1),15a which was advanced to preclinical safety evaluation. Importantly, the discovery of the potent bicyclic scaffold set the stage for exploratory work employing additional P1 moieties,7c,16 many of which demonstrated subnanomolar fXa binding affinities and moderate to high clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (Vdss) in dogs. However, the lack of adequate differentiation from compound 4 in terms of improvement in the overall pharmacokinetic profile made them less attractive for further development. In this paper, we report an optimization strategy that resulted in the identification of compound 40, a structurally novel and neutral bicyclic pyrazole

fXa inhibitor (currently in phase III trials) with a superior pharmacokinetic profile (low clearance and volume of distribution) compared to compound 4. Chemistry The synthesis of the C-3 trifluoromethylpyrazole analogue 6 was accomplished via the cyclization methodology previously described.15,16a Scheme 1 illustrates the general synthetic methodology utilized to prepare diversified pyrazole C-3 analogues. Commercially available 4-methoxyaniline was diazotized (NaNO2, concentrated HCl, 0 °C) and condensed in situ with either 1-chloro-1-(methylsulfonyl)propan-2-one or ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate in the presence of sodium acetate17 to provide the requisite p-methoxyphenylchlorohydrazones 7a in 57% yield and 7b in 90% yield. Treatment of the chlorohydrazones 7a and 7b with compound 815 using excess triethylamine afforded the requisite [3 + 2] cycloadducts which, when treated with TFA in dichloromethane, led to compounds 9a (80% yield) and 9b (71% yield) respectively. Suzuki coupling of 9a,b with 2-formylbenzeneboronic acid as illustrated for compound 515 afforded the biaryl o-carboxaldehyde intermediates 10a in 71% yield and 10b in 80% yield, respectively. Subsequent reductive amination with 3-(R)-hydroxypyrrolidine15,16a provided the bicyclic pyrazole compounds 11a (45% yield) and 11b (69% yield). Hydrolysis (LiOH in THF and water) of the ester group in 11b gave the desired C-3 carboxylic acid compound 12 in 51% yield. Compounds 13a-h were prepared in a two-step sequence by the reductive amination of 10b followed by carboxamide formation as described above in yields that ranged between 80% and 90%. Alternatively, treatment of compound 11b with ammonium hydroxide in ethanol at 80 °C for 4 days provided the carboxamidopyrazole analogue 13f in 45% yield. Hydrolysis (NaOH (1 N) in THF/water) of 9b gave carboxylic acid intermediate 14a (90% yield). Treatment of the pyrazole ester 9b under the Weinreb amide conditions (methylamine or dimethylamine, trimethylaluminum (1 N) in DCM at 0 °C to room temperature)18 provided 14b (92% yield) and 14c (88% yield). The compounds were subsequently converted to 15a,b in 55% and 46% yield, respectively, following the Suzuki and reductive amination procedures. To prepare the cyanopyrazole compound 18, compound 10b was first converted to the carboxamidobiarylcarboxaldehyde 16 in 66% yield by treatment with ammonia in methanol at 80 °C. Dehydration (oxalyl chloride in DMF) to 17 (42% yield) followed by reductive amination gave the desired cyano compound 18 (27% yield). The aminopyrazole compounds 20-25 were accessed according to the methodologies outlined in Scheme 2. Curtius rearrangement19 of the pyrazolecarboxylic intermediate 14a provided the Boc protected aminopyrazole intermediate 19a in 22% yield. Biarylcarboxaldehyde formation (20, 93% yield) followed by reductive amination with 3-(R)-hydroxypyrrolidine afforded compound 21 in 77% yield. Treatment of compound 21 with TFA provided compound 22 in 10% yield. Alternatively, compound 21 was alkylated with sodium hydride and iodomethane in anhydrous DMF to afford 23 in 42% yield. Treatment of 23 with TFA in dichloromethane afforded compound 24 in 99% yield. To prepare compound 25, pyrazole derivative 19a was deprotected with TFA and reductively aminated with formaldehyde (37%) and sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of zinc chloride (0.5 M in THF) to afford the dimethylaminopyrazole compound 19b in 51% yield. Biarylcarboxaldehyde formation followed by reductive amination with 3-(R)-hydroxypyrrolidine afforded compound 25 in 34% yield. Tetrazolyl compounds 27 and 28 were prepared according to Scheme 3. Treatment of 14b with lutidine and triflic

anhydride generated the iminotriflate, which was directly treated with excess sodium azide to give the tetrazole derivative 26 in 48% yield. Suzuki coupling with 2-formylboronic acid and reductive amination with 3-(R)-hydroxypyrrolidine led to 27 in 47% yield. The tetrazole compound 28 was prepared in 52% yield by heating compound 18 with sodium azide in DMF. Heteroarylalkyl compounds 33a-e were synthesized according to procedures outlined in Scheme 4. Borane reduction of carboxylic acid20 intermediate 14a afforded the alcohol intermediate 29 in 89% yield, which was subsequently converted to the bromomethyl intermediate 30 by treatment with phosphorus tribromide (PBr3) in dichloromethane in 94% yield. Displacement of the crude bromide 30 with 1,2,3-triazole, 1,2,4-triazole, or 1H-tetrazole afforded mixtures of regioisomeric triazolemethyl or tetrazolylmethyl compounds 31a-e, which were subsequently converted to biarylcarboxaldehyde compounds 32a-e and later to the desired compounds 33a-e. Variably substituted P4 anilino compounds 34, 35, and 36a-e were prepared according to the methods outlined in Scheme 5. Aryl amination of compound 9c according to the Buchwald amination methodology21 afforded compound 34 in 97% yield. Acetylation of 34 with acetic anhydride and triethylamine gave the acetyl derivative 35 in 97% yield. Alternatively, aniline 34 was converted to the Boc protected derivative 36a by treatment with Boc anhydride (neat) at 80 °C in 84% yield. Alkylation with iodomethane provided 36b in quantitative yield (100%). Removal of the Boc protecting group afforded 36c was acetylated to afford compound 36d. Alkylation of 36c with idodomethane and potassium carbonate provided compound 36e in 47% yield.

Analogues in which the P4 moiety is either the phenylpiperidinyl or the corresponding phenyllactam groups were accessed according to the methods outlined in Scheme 6. Ullmann coupling22 (K2CO3, CuI, 1,10-phenanthroline in DMSO, 130 °C) of compound 9c with excess piperidine in a sealed tube provided compound 37 in 5% yield. In a similar manner, the Ullmann coupling of 9c with -valerolactam or caprolactam led to the P4 phenyllactam analogues 38a,b in 20-25% yield. Likewise, treatment of pyrazole 9b with -valerolactam under similar Ullmann conditions provided compound 39 in 21% yield, which on aminolysis with ammonia in ethylene glycol at 120 °C provided compound 40 in 76% yield. The preparation of compound 47 is outlined in Scheme 7. Cycloaddition of chlorohydrazone compound 7b and morpholine derivative 42 (prepared in 65% yield from lactam 41) with triethylamine in toluene under reflux conditions followed by treatment with TFA afforded the bicyclic pyrazole 43 in 75% yield. Hydrogenation (palladium on carbon in methanol) provided aniline 44 in 96% yield. Boc protection of 44 (Boc2O, NaH in THF) followed by alkylation (NaH and iodomethane) and removal of the Boc group with TFA provided the N-methylaniline derivative 45 in 56% yield. Aminolysis of 45 with ammonia in ethylene glycol at 120 °C led to compound 46, which was acetylated (acetyl chloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide (1 N) in DCM) to compound 47 in 30% yield. Results and Discussion Because of the enhancement in potency seen with the tetrahydropyrazolopyridone scaffold, efforts to extend the SAR to include neutral P1 groups such as the p-methoxyphenyl that previously showed reduced fXa binding in the monocyclic pyrazole series proved to be successful.16a-b Although the compounds with this P1 group showed potent fXa inhibition in

bicyclic pyrazole series required careful adjustment for potency and polarity at the C-3 pyrazole position for possible alternatives to the lipophilic trifluoromethyl substituent (Table 1). In the course of our investigation of the C-3 pyrazole position, we

were gratified to see the breadth of substitutions that were readily accommodated in this region of the fXa active site. For example, in addition to the trifluoromethyl analogue 6,16a subnanomolar inhibitory activity was seen for the methylsulfonyl compound 11a (fXa Ki ) 0.25 nM), the carboxamido compound 13f

(fXa Ki ) 0.07 nM), the nitrile compound 18 (fXa Ki ) 0.33 nM), and the dimethylamino compound 25 (fXa Ki ) 0.31 nM). The binding affinity and clotting activity of the carboxamide analog 13f showed significant improvement when compared to the corresponding trifluoro-methyl compound 6. Compared to the parent carboxamide 13f, the substituted carboxamides 15a and 15b, though significantly less potent in the binding assay, were only about 2- to 3-fold less potent in the clotting (PT) assay. The ester analogue 11b and its corresponding carboxylic acid 12 were less potent in both assays. Among the C-3 amino analogues investigated, the order of fXa potency was NMe2 > NHMe g N(Me)Boc g NH2, NHBoc. The unsubstituted amino analogue 22 and the N-methylamino compound 24 demonstrated acceptable activity in the clotting

assay. Amongst the tetrazole analogs, the tetrazole compound 27 showed moderate clotting activity, though less potent in the binding assay, and the reverse was true for tetrazole 28. Triazolylmethyl and tetrazolylmethyl analogues 33a-d exhibited good potencies in both assays. Overall, the compounds shown in Table 1 were highly selective (>1000-fold) for fXa relative to other serine proteases such as thrombin and trypsin. Table 2 lists the pharmacokinetic profile in dogs of a representative set of the most optimized C-3 substituted compounds. The carboxamide 13f demonstrated an excellent pharmacokinetic profile, with low clearance (Cl ) 0.32 L kg-1 h-1), moderate volume of distribution (Vdss ) 1.6 L kg-1), and a half-life (T1/2) of 5.6 h. The high oral bioavailability (F ) 100%) exhibited by 13f was consistent with the high apparent permeability (Papp ) 2.3 × 10-6 cm s-1) of this compound in the Caco-2 assay.23 In contrast, the pharmacokinetic profiles of the triazole analogue 33a and the 1,2,3,4-tetrazole analogue 33d were poor with high clearance, moderate volume of distribution, and poor oral bioavailability. Given the excellent fXa activity exhibited by compound 13f and its high oral bioavailability, we shifted the focus on further P4 optimization (Table 3). In general, the compounds retained subnanomolar fXa binding affinity and potent clotting activity, good selectivity (trypsin/thrombin, >100-fold), and showed good permeability (Papp) in the Caco-2 assay. The unsubstituted amino compound 13a (fXa Ki ) 0.97 nM) was the least potent, whereas the substituted amino compounds 13b-d exhibited

potent fXa inhibitory activity (fXa Ki < 0.3 nM) and good clotting activity (PT EC2× < 1.5 µM). As was observed with the 3-(R)-hydroxypyrrolidine compound 13f, the 4-hydroxypiperidinyl analogue 13g also demonstrated low clearance, moderate volume of distribution, and half-life in the same range as observed with 13f. Again, the high dog oral bioavailability seen for 13g (F ) 55%) correlated well with the observed Caco-2 (Papp) permeability value. In the rabbit arteriovenous shunt (AVShunt) thrombosis model,6g compounds 13b, 13c, 13f, and 13g inhibited thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 445, 175, 120, and 180 nM, respectively, and with the exception of 13b were slightly more potent than compound 4 (AVShunt IC50 ) 340 nM)7a and were in the same range when compared to compound 5 (AVShunt IC50 ) 140 nM).15a Of the compounds in this series, 13b had the longest half-life in dogs, albeit with relatively high clearance and high volume of distribution. Interestingly, these data did not correlate well with the observed 13b half-life in the human liver microsome (HLM) assay24 (T1/2 > 100 min). In the same assay, the HLM half-life for compounds 4 and 5 was 38 and 42 min, respectively. Taken together therefore, the carboxamide pyrazole analogue 13f emerged as a potent alternative to compound 4, with excellent potency both in vitro and in vivo and a good pharmacokinetic profile in dogs. In a parallel effort, the compounds containing P4 nitrogen atom (as the point of attachment) were also explored (Table 4).12c This strategy proved to be highly successful in that a potent compound 36d bearing a N-methylacetyl group was quickly identified. This discovery was significant in that it differed in structure from all our previous pendent P4 groups we had explored. The compound, though more potent than the aniline derivatives 34, 36c, and 36e, was weak in the clotting assay, suggesting high protein binding. The high level of potency exhibited by compound 36d (fXa Ki ) 0.50 nM) suggested that the orientation of the P4 N-methylacetyl substituent in the S4 region of the fXa active site is very important. This type of observation was unique in the fXa literature at the time it was discovered. To explain this finding, a closer look at the model of 36d in the active site of fXa clearly showed the N-methyl P4 group forming a lipophilic  interaction with the bottom S4 Trp215 residue,12d and thus positioning the acetyl carbonyl functionality perpendicular to the inner P4 phenyl ring, thereby forming a hydrophobic interaction with the other residues in this region. The importance of the orientation of the N-methyl group was confirmed by the loss in fXa affinity with the acetamide analogue 35 (fXa Ki ) 180 nM) where the planarity of this group positioned it in an unfavorable orientiation in the S4 region of the enzyme. The dimethylamino analogue 36e (fXa Ki ) 6.0 nM) and piperidinyl 37 (fXa Ki ) 2.1 nM) were also less potent, suggesting a planar orientation with these moieties in the S4 region as well. Cyclization of the P4 N-methyl acetyl group in 36d to form lactam analogues 38a and 38b retains the subnanomolar fXa binding affinity. Unfortunately, lactam analogues 38a (PT ) 23 µM) and 38b (PT ) 26 µM) exhibited poor anticoagulant activity. This could be explained by the high lipophilicity (cLogP > 7) and high human serum protein binding (>99%)25 exhibited by these compounds. In order to modulate the lipophilicity of 36d and 38a, we reintroduced the polar C-3 carboxamido moiety (Table 5) that was shown to be important in compounds 13a-h. The carboxamidopyrazole analogue 40 (fXa Ki ) 0.08 nM, PT ) 3.8 µM) and 47 (fXa Ki ) 0.61 nM, PT ) 3.1 µM) not only maintained subnanomolar fXa binding affinity but also demonstrated much improved potency in the clotting (PT) assay,

especially when compared to the related trifluoromethylpyrazole analogues 38a and 36d. Selectivity and Liability Profiling. Compound 40 shows a high degree of selectivity versus other proteases (see supplemental section), even compared to compounds 47a and 5.15a Additionally, the compound shows weak activity against various P450 isozymes (IC50 > 25µM) and weak activity against the hERG potassium channel (IC50 > 25 µM, patch clamp assay).26a-e The solubility of compound 40 was shown to be approximately 40-50 µg/mL.27 In the human liver microsome assay, compound 40 was very stable with a T1/2 of >100 min (the HLM T1/2 of 47 was not measured). The Caco-2 permeability values for compounds 40 (Papp ) 0.9 × 10-6 cm s-1) and 47 (Papp ) 2.5 × 10-6 cm s-1) were moderate to high. Dog Pharmacokinetics and Rabbit Antithrombotic Efficacy. As a result of the excellent in vitro potency and selectivity of compounds 40 and 47, the pharmacokinetic profiles of both compounds were studied in dogs using a cassette dosing paradigm ("N-in-one" study, Table 6).7a,34a,b The acetylated N-methyl analogue 47 was orally bioavailable; but showed high clearance (Cl ) 2.8 L kg-1 h-1), moderate volume of distribution (Vdss ) 1.7 L kg-1), and unacceptable half life.

lower than those observed with compounds 4 and 5. FXa being a vascular target, the pharmacokinetic profile for compound 40 was viewed as highly desirable and less likely to have nontargetrelated adverse effects. Importantly, compound 40 had a moderate half-life (T1/2 ) 5.8 h) and good oral bioavailability (F ) 58%). The human serum protein binding as measured by equilibrium dialysis for 40 was 87%.25 In the rabbit AVShunt thrombosis model (Figure 4), compound 40 inhibited thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 329 nM.15d,e This is comparable to the antithrombotic potency obtained for compound 4 (IC50 ) 340 nM) in the same model. X-ray Crystallography of Compound 40. The X-ray structure for compound 40 bound to fXa (Figure 2, 2.3 Å resolution with an R value of 0.229 and an Rfree of 0.277) shows a tight inhibitor-enzyme complex30-33 and shows a similar binding mode compared to compound 211 and 4.7a The pmethoxy group in the S1 specificity pocket does not appear to interact with any specific residue in this region of the enzyme, and is oriented in a planar manner relative to the phenyl P1 moiety. Other interactions that were found to be similar to those observed for compounds 47a and 515a included the pyrazole N-2 nitrogen atom interaction with the backbone of Gln192 (3.2 Å) and the carbonyl oxygen (scaffold carboxamide) interaction with the NH of Gly216 (2.9 Å). The pyrazole C-3 carboxamido moiety shows the NH within bonding distance to the Glu146 carbonyl oxygen (3.1 Å) with the carbonyl oxygen solvent exposed. The orientation of the pendant P4 phenyllactam of 40 in the S4 region shows an edge to face interaction with Trp215 and is appropriately positioned between the Tyr99 and Phe174

Experimental Section
All reactions were run under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen unless otherwise noted. Solvents and reagents were obtained from commercial vendors in the appropriate grade and used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. NMR spectra (1H, 13C, 19F) were obtained on VXR or Unity 300 MHz instruments (Varian Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) with chemical shift in ppm downfield from TMS as an internal reference standard. 1H assignment abbreviations are as follows: singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), pentet (p), broad singlet (bs), doublet of doublets (dd), doublet of triplets (dt), and multiplet (m). Elemental analyses were performed by Quantitative Technologies, Inc., Whitehouse, NJ, and were within 0.4% of the theoretical values. Mass spectra were measured with a HP 5988A mass spectrometer with a particle beam interface using NH3 for chemical ionization or a Finnigan MAT 8230 mass spectrometer with NH3-DCI or VG TRIO 2000 for ESI. High-resolution mass spectra were measured on a VG 70-VSE instrument with NH3 ionization. Flash chromatography was carried out using EM Science silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh). Preparative thin layer chromatography was done on EM Science 60 plates F254 (2 mm, 20 cm × 20 cm). HPLC purification was performed on a Jasco 900 series instrument or a Rainin Dynamax SD200 using a C18 reverse-phase column with acetonitrile/H2O (containing 0.05% TFA) as a mobile phase. All compounds were found to be >95% pure by HPLC analysis unless otherwise noted. X-ray Crystallographic Studies. The factor Xa/compound 40 crystals were obtained from GLA-Domainless -Factor Xa (Haematologic Technologies) that had been fractionated on a Amersham mono-Q 10/10 column equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 and eluted with a 20-bed volume gradient from 0 to 500 mM NaCl. Inhibitor was added to the fractions as they were collected. Protein of interest eluted at about 100 mM NaCl. This solution was incubated for 12 h and concentrated to 6 mg/mL using a Vivaspin 6 mL concentrator with a 5000 MWCO membrane. The crystals were grown at 4 °C using hanging drop vapor diffusion, with 18% PEG 6000 and 200 mM NaOAc (pH 5.5) in the reservoir. Hanging drops contained 4 µL of protein solution and 4 µL of reservoir solution. The drops were microseeded with a crushed crystal from a previous crystal growth. Cryoprotectant was introduced to the factor Xa crystals by first transferring the crystals to a 2 µL drop of the soaking solution and then bridging the small drop into a 20 µL drop of solution containing 22% PEG 200, buffered with 200 mM Na acetate (pH 5.5) and 20% ethylene glycol. After about a minute in this solution, the crystals were frozen. Data for the fXa/40 complex were collected at the DuPont-Northwestern-Dow Collaborative Access Team (DND-CAT) located at Sector 5 of the Advanced Photon Source (APS). DND-CAT is supported by E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., The Dow Chemical Company and the State of Illinois. Use of the APS was supported by the U. S.

orthogonality to optimally position itself between the S4 enzyme residues Trp215, Tyr99, and Phe174. Overall, compound 40 fits into the fXa enzyme active site in a highly complementary manner. Figure 3 shows an overlay of the X-ray structures of the fXa-bound compounds 40 and 4. Conclusions Several bicyclic pyrazolopyridinone analogues bearing the p-methoxyphenyl P1 moiety have been identified with potent inhibitory activity against coagulation fXa. A diverse set of C-3 substituents were identified that retained potent fXa activity and possessed good clotting (PT) activity. Most optimal in terms of in vitro potency and potency in the clotting assay is the C-3 carboxamido pyrazole moiety. Combination of this moiety with the relatively polar and neutral lactam P4 moiety resulted in compound 40, with high metabolic stability, ultralow clearance, and low volume of distribution. Compound 40 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable fXa inhibitor that demonstrates antithrombotic efficacy similar to compound 4 in the rabbit arteriovenous shunt thrombosis model (Figure 4). Importantly, compound 40 (apixaban, BMS-562247) is a significant improvement when compared to compound 4 based on its excellent pharmacokinetic profile and has been advanced to human clinical trials for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis.

AC02-06CH11357. Data were collected at a wavelength of 1.0 Å at 100 K using an Oxford cryosystems cooling device. Data frames of 1° rotation were collected. Data were 99% complete. Raw data were processed with the program HKL.30 The program EPMR31 was used to determine the initial model for refinement using the PDB coordinates 1FJS (minus the inhibitor and solvent molecules) as the search model. The CNX (Accelrys) program was used for crystallographic refinement. Simulated annealing (at a maximum temperature of 3000 K) was followed by B-factor refinement. The inhibitor was built with the program QUANTA (Accelrys). Peaks in the difference electron density map that were greater than 3 and that were less than 4 Å away from the protein were built in as solvent molecules. No major adjustments to the protein model were needed during the course of the refinements. Final R values as well as other relevant data collection statistics are found in Supporting Information. Coordinates for the enzyme inhibitor structure have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with the code 2P16. Enzyme Affinity Assays. All enzyme Ki values were obtained from purified human enzymes. All fXa assays were run in microtiter plates using a total volume of 250 µL in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl and 0.5% polyethylene glycol 6000 at pH 7.0. The compounds were run at 10, 3.16, 1.0, 0.316, 0.1, 0.0316, 0.01, and 0.003 16 µM. Plates were read for 30 min at 405 nm. Rates were determined in the presence of the controls (no inhibitor) and for the inhibitors. Percent enzyme activity was determined from these rates and used in the following formula to determine Ki: Ki ) InhibitorConcentration Km + S - S* ACT -1 ACT*Km

where S is the substrate concentration and ACT is the fraction of percent enzyme activity for inhibitor rates. All compounds were tested in duplicate studies and were compared with the same internal standards. The intraassay and interassay variabilities are 5% and 20%, respectively. These assays are described in detail in refs 28 and 29. All of the enzyme assays were conducted in pH 7.4 buffer at room temperature. All enzymes were purified from human tissues and were obtained from commercially available sources. Individual enzyme and substrate Km were determined in separate experiments and were close to values established in the literature. Steady-state inhibition of enzyme activity was determined by incubating a range of inhibitor concentrations (1 nM to 50 µM, in duplicate) with fixed enzyme (0.1-100 nM) and peptide substrate (200-1000 µM) concentration for up to 30 min. The Ki was calculated, assuming competitive inhibition and one-site binding, either from the IC50 or from the extent of inhibition at each inhibitor concentration. In Vitro Coagulation Assays (PT/APTT). Standard clotting assays were performed in a temperature-controlled automated coagulation device (Sysmex 6000, Dade-Behring). Blood was obtained from healthy volunteers by venipuncture and anticoagulated with 1/10 volume of 0.11 M buffered sodium citrate (Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson). Plasma was obtained after centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min and kept on ice prior to use. An initial stock solution of the inhibitor at 10 mM was prepared in DMSO. Subsequent dilutions were done in plasma. Plasma solutions containing inhibitor were kept on ice prior to assay. Clotting time was determined on control plasma and plasma containing five to seven different concentrations of inhibitor. Determinations at each plasma concentration were done in duplicate. The clotting time at each concentration was compared with the control clotting time for each pooled plasma. The prothrombin time test was performed using Dade Thromboplastin C Plus according to the reagent instructions. Plasma (50 µL) was warmed to 37 °C for 3 min before adding Dade Thromboplastin C Plus (100 µL). The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was performed using AlexinTM (Sigma Diagnostics) according to the reagent instructions. Plasma (50 µL) was warmed to 37 °C for 1 min before adding aPTT reagent (50 µL). Three minutes later calcium chloride (50 µL) was added.

Dog "N-in-One" Pharmacokinetic Study. Pharmacokinetic study protocols were approved by the site Animal Care and Use Committee. Compounds were dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAC) to a concentration of 20 mg/mL. Compounds were combined in a final dosing solution containing 0.2 mg/mL of each compound in 10:10:10:70 % v/v DMAC/ethanol/propylene glycol/ water. Beagle dogs were administered 2.5 mL kg-1 h-1 for 1 h by intravenous infusion or 1 mL kg-1 by oral gavage. At timed intervals, blood samples were drawn into 1/10 volume of 3.2% sodium citrate and placed on ice. Plasma was obtained after centrifuging blood at 2000g for 10 min at 4 C. Urine was collected up to 24 h after dosing. Plasma and urine were frozen on dry ice and stored at -70 °C for later analysis. Samples from the pharmacokinetic studies were analyzed with LC-MS/MS methods. High-throughput technologies such as the turbulent-flow columnswitching technique and direct plasma sample injection were applied to some studies. In general, the analytical methods were specific and sensitive with a quantification level of 1 nM. The intraday variability was less than 30%. Average run time was about 6 min for each sample.34a-c Syntheses. Preparation of (Z)-N-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)methanehydrazonoyl Chloride (7a).
