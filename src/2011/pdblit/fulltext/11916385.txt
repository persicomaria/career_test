The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a ubiquitous ribonucleoprotein particle involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. Crystal structures are now available for three protein­RNA subcomplexes from the SRP, which give insights into fundamental aspects of protein­RNA recognition, the assembly of stable ribonucleoprotein particles and the mechanism of action of the SRP.

The SRP is a universally conserved RNP, suggesting that it is of ancient origin. In the archaeal and eubacterial kingdoms, however, it has reduced complexity compared with the eukaryotic SRP [5] (Figure 1). In archaea, a large SRP RNA is maintained, but only homologues of SRP19 and SRP54 have so far been identified. In many eubacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli), the SRP comprises only a 4.5S RNA to which an SRP54 homologue (Ffh; fifty-four homologue) binds, although some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) have a large RNA that conserves the Alu domain (Figure 1). While the goal of structural studies of the SRP is ultimately to obtain structures of functional complexes (e.g. SRP with signal peptide bound, SRP­SRP receptor complex, ribosome­nascent chain­SRP complex), significant progress has been made in recent years in determining the structure of components and subcomplexes from the SRP [1]. This review focuses on the structures of three protein­RNA subcomplexes from the SRP (Figure 2), which together yield considerable new insight into the structure, assembly and function of the particle. These structures are the Alu domain of the human SRP [6··]; the M-domain of E. coli Ffh complexed with a fragment of 4.5S RNA [7··]; and human SRP19 complexed with its primary binding site on helix 6 of the 7SL RNA [8··].

Introduction
The mammalian signal recognition particle (SRP) is an 11S cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) comprising a 300-nucleotide SRP RNA (denoted 7SL RNA) complexed with six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14 and 9 (Figure 1). The SRP mediates the co-translational targeting of signalpeptide-bearing secretory or membrane proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum [1]. The SRP68/72 heterodimer, SRP19 and SRP54 bind to the central sequences of the RNA and constitute the SRP S-domain [2]. In eukaryotes, SRP19 must bind to S-domain RNA before SRP54 during SRP assembly [3]. SRP54 binds to SRP RNA via its C-terminal methionine-rich domain (M-domain), which also binds the signal peptide emerging from the exit site of the ribosome. The N-terminal and central GTPase domain of SRP54 (NG domain) interacts with the membrane-bound heterodimeric SRP receptor (SR and SR) during the docking of the ribosome­nascent chain­SRP complex to the endoplasmic reticulum [4]. The heterodimer of SRP9 and SRP14 (SRP9/14) binds to the 3 and 5 extremities of the SRP RNA, forming the so-called Alu domain, which functions to retard peptide chain elongation while docking to the membrane translocon occurs.

The structure and assembly of the mammalian SRP Alu domain
The Alu domain of the mammalian SRP contains SRP9/14, which has been shown to bind to a minimal fragment of about 90 nucleotides of SRP RNA comprising the 3 and 5 sequences [9]. The two protein subunits have a very similar  topology (Figure 3) and heterodimerise to form a continuous six-stranded strikingly concave  sheet, which is highly positively charged; the four  helices are packed on the convex side [10]. SRP14 differs from SRP9 in possessing an extended loop between  strands 2 and 3, and an extended C-terminal tail that is rich in basic residues. The RNA to which the SRP9/14 heterodimer binds consists of two flexibly linked domains -- the 5 domain and the 3 domain (respectively, nucleotides 1­47 and nucleotides 48­64 and 283­301 of SRP RNA). Crystal structures have recently been published of two human Alu domain complexes [6··]. The first structure, at 3.2 Å resolution, is of SRP9/14 bound to a 50-nucleotide RNA comprising the 5 domain (Figure 2a). The second structure, at 4.0 Å resolution, is of SRP9/14 bound to an artificial construct of 90 nucleotides in which the 3 stem is rigidly

(c) The eubacterial SRP generally is a minimal particle that only includes the SRP54 homologue, Ffh, bound to the most conserved part of the SRP RNA. However, in some Gram-positive bacteria, such as B. subtilis, the Alu domain is retained, with the dimeric HBsu protein replacing SRP9/14. SRP54/Ffh comprises the C-terminal M-domain, which binds the RNA and the signal peptide, and the NG domain.

linked to the 5 domain. Together with considerable biochemical information, these two structures permit a plausible model of the wild-type Alu domain to be derived, as well as a possible assembly pathway [6··,11·] (Figure 4). The secondary structure of the Alu RNA 5 domain shows a three-way junction of stems (Figure 4a): a short one, which contains the 5 end of 7SL RNA (stem one), and two stem-loops (stems two and three). In three dimensions, the RNA adopts an arrangement known as a -junction, which comprises two helical stacks connected by a U-turn. The first and third stems stack on each other, and the second stem is fixed at an angle that is determined by the central U-turn loop and by the interaction of the peripheral loops at the ends of stems two and three. In mammalian Alu

RNA, three stacked Watson­Crick interloop base pairs occur. SRP9/14 binds the RNA largely via basic residues located on the concave -sheet surface, recognising the particular backbone conformation of the central U-turn in the 5 domain and thus stabilising the -junction. This interaction is sufficient for specific recognition because SRP9/14 binds tightly to the isolated Alu RNA 5 domain [11·]. Indeed, the formation of the 5 domain complex is likely to be the first step in Alu domain folding and assembly, as it creates the site for the subsequent binding of the flexibly linked Alu RNA 3 domain. This helical stem packs in the concave protein surface (mainly against SRP9), adjacent to the 5 domain (which contacts mainly SRP14), making both protein­RNA and RNA­RNA contacts, which together explain the complex footprint of

SRP9/14 on Alu RNA [11·]. This final step in Alu domain assembly might be reversible and could change the respective orientations of the SRP Alu and S domains by up to 180° [11·] (Figure 4d).

Functional implications of the Alu domain structure
The best-characterised function of the SRP Alu domain is peptide chain elongation retardation (`elongation arrest') of nascent chain­ribosome complexes that are being targeted to membrane translocons via the SRP [12]. It is thought that this maintains the nascent polypeptide chain in a translocation-competent state during the membrane docking process without risk of the premature folding of protein domains. Elongation arrest has been demonstrated in the mammalian system [12,13] and in yeast [14·]. Furthermore, in both cases, deletion of the basic C-terminal extension of SRP14 leads to elimination of elongation arrest without affecting either SRP assembly or its ability to bind to ribosomes [13,14·]. There are no data for archaea, in which the RNA component of the Alu domain is conserved, but for the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis, some translational and

sporulation defects are observed upon elimination of the SRP Alu domain or upon limitation of the protein HBsu [15,16]. HBsu is a dimeric, histone-like bacterial DNA-binding protein that also binds the bacterial Alu RNA [17]. It is unrelated to SRP9/14, which is restricted to eukaryotes. Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli have no SRP Alu domain and no reported elongation arrest activity. It has been speculated that the Alu domain might function in translation arrest by the RNA component mimicking tRNA and, through this mechanism, sterically blocking access of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site on the ribosome [2,18]. The structure of the mammalian Alu domain clearly shows that there is no molecular mimicry of tRNA, although a mechanism of arrest involving the interaction of the Alu domain with the tRNA-binding site of the ribosome cannot be excluded [6··]. However, it is still not clear exactly what features of the Alu domain are required for elongation arrest, since neither the RNA component nor the protein component are extensively conserved. The RNA component of the SRP Alu domain is universally recognisable by the presence of a conserved U-turnU containing sequence, UGURR (where U forms the U-turn

The fold of SRP RNA-binding proteins compared with common RNA-binding domains. SRP19 has a similar  topology to the KH domain [27], with an antiparallel three-stranded  sheet (1-3-2 order of the  strands) packed against two  helices on one side. In the RNA-recognition motif (RRM) [43], the same topology is extended by a fourth  strand. SRP9 [10] and SRP14 (not shown) have an  topology (1-2-3 order of the  strands) and resemble the double stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) [44].

Although SRP9, SRP14 and SRP19 share similar topologies with common RNA-binding motifs, the position of the  helices, the organisation and length of the loop regions, and the manner of RNA binding are unique to the SRP proteins. The M-domain of Thermus aquaticus Ffh is all -helical and has no similarities with the other RNA-binding domains [45]; it is highly homologous to the human SRP54 M-domain [23].

and R is a conserved purine), which can form a -junction, and by the flexibility of the link between the RNA 5 and 3 domains (Figure 4a). However, the size of the peripheral stem-loops and their potential for loop­loop interactions vary considerably. The most extensive loop­loop interactions are predicted to occur in archaea and Gram-positive bacteria (Figure 4c), and the fewest interactions seem to be possible in certain plant SRP RNAs, which have a severely truncated second stem and loop. The most extreme example is Saccharomyces cerevisiae [19] or Schizosaccharomyces pombe [5], in which the Alu RNA 5 domain is apparently reduced to the conserved U-turn loop (Figure 4b). In bacterial (Figure 4c) and archaeal RNAs, there is an additional stem between the elongated 5 and 3 ends [5], correlating with the absence of SRP9/14. Thus, the size and

shape of the RNA component are very variable -- the most conserved part, the U-turn, being that which is recognised, at least in eukaryotes, by the SRP9/14 heterodimer. The protein component of the SRP Alu domain also varies across the three kingdoms. Homologues of SRP9/14 are limited to eukaryotes, with the exception of S. cerevisiae, in which an SRP14 homodimer replaces the SRP9/14 heterodimer [19]. In B. subtilis, the HBsu protein has been shown to bind to the -junction of Alu RNA, whereas in archaea, no Alu-binding protein has been identified so far. As a consequence, the archaeal and bacterial systems lack an apparent equivalent of the highly conserved basic tail of SRP14 [5], which confers or modulates elongation arrest activity in eukaryotes.

In a first step, the preformed heterodimer of SRP9 (red) and SRP14 (green, with the important C-terminal tail dotted in cyan) first binds to and organises the Alu RNA 5 domain. In a second step, the Alu RNA 3 domain flips by up to 180° and is clamped against the 5 Alu RNP. The RNA backbone is traced in yellow (orange where structurally conserved).

In order to reconcile all functional, phylogenetic and structural data, it is clear that further studies on the mechanism of elongation arrest need to be made. For this, the Alu domain structure will be useful to aid the design of variants of the protein or RNA components that may affect the activity. However, it is especially important, in view of the availability of the atomic-resolution structure of the ribosome [20,21], to determine, for example, by cross-linking experiments, where the Alu domain binds to the ribosome­nascent chain complex.

The Ffh protein M-domain complexed with a fragment of 4.5S RNA from E. coli
The signal-peptide-binding complex of the SRP54/Ffh protein M-domain with domain IV (helix 8 in eukaryotes)

of SRP RNA is one of the most conserved ribonucleoprotein elements in biology. The high-resolution crystal structure of this SRP core has been determined for the E. coli system (Figure 2c), revealing, in great detail, the importance of water, metal ions and noncanonical base pairs in the protein­RNA interface [7··]. Structures are also known for the individual RNA and protein components [22·,23]. The M-domain consists of five  helices and thus differs from the majority of small RNA-binding proteins, which have / folds (Figure 3). The RNA is rod-like, with a classic GNRA-type tetraloop at the tip (N any nucleotide; R, purine), which does not contact the protein, and two internal loops, which form a contiguous and unique minor groove surface onto which the protein packs. One loop is a symmetrical internal loop with four consecutive

non-Watson­Crick base pairs and the other is an asymmetric internal loop that forms a bulge. Upon complex formation, the protein and RNA components interact largely as rigid bodies, with some stabilisation of the conformation of the asymmetric loop [22·]. The M-domain contains a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, with the first helix and turn contacting the unique minor groove surface of the RNA. This is in contrast to the mode of nucleic acid binding exhibited by the HTH motif in DNA-binding proteins, whereby the second  helix interacts with the DNA major groove [24]. A thorough structural and thermodynamic analysis of the importance of various contacts in the protein­RNA interface has been made by measuring the affinity of the M-domain for a series of RNA mutants [25··].

with this conserved feature (Figure 5a). As with the M-domain­helix 8 protein­RNA complex, the structure reveals the importance of numerous highly ordered water molecules in contributing to the specificity of the protein­RNA interface. SRP19, which is not homologous to other known RNAbinding proteins, is a single-domain -type protein with a central three-stranded antiparallel  sheet packed on one side against two helices. Its particular  topology is similar to that of the K-homology (KH) domain [27], but the two differ in the size and the relative orientation of the secondary structure elements and the internal loops (Figure 3). This reflects the quite different manner of RNA recognition by the two modules. SRP19 sits on the tip of helix 6, with the 1 edge of the  sheet contacting the GGAG tetraloop, and has two long loops (L1 and L3) that sense the adjacent extremely wide major groove of the RNA (Figure 5a). The KH domain binds to a single-stranded tetranucleotide sequence via a hydrophobic mixed --loop platform, the RNA being on the opposite edge of the protein compared to the situation in SRP19. Nevertheless, the equivalent loops connecting the corresponding secondary structure elements are used for

SRP19 complexed with helix 6 of 7SL RNA
The 1.8 Å resolution structure of human SRP19 in complex with a 29-nucleotide stem-loop fragment of SRP RNA helix 6 has recently been reported [8··] (Figure 2b), complementing a previously determined structure of the uncomplexed RNA [26]. Helix 6 is closed by an unusual GNAR-type tetraloop, 147GGAG in human 7SL RNA, and SRP19 is found to be in intimate contact

RNA recognition and contain the respective invariant sequence motifs. SRP RNA helix 6 is capped by an unusual GNAR-type tetraloop, with the adenosine at the third position being strictly conserved in SRP RNAs. Figure 5b compares the structure of the helix 6 GGAG tetraloop with the more common GNRA-type tetraloop, in which the conserved adenosine is at the fourth position. GNRA-type tetraloops are characterised by a specific hydrogen-bonding network, including a sheared G·A base pair between the first and the fourth base. The corresponding G·G base pair in the GGAG tetraloop is only indirectly formed by inserted water molecules. Similarly, at the third position of the GGAG tetraloop, two water molecules are inserted and displace the base more than 4 Å away from the first nucleotide (Figure 5b). Thus, the GGAG tetraloop is considerably more open, although the last three bases remain stacked. SRP19 recognises the tetraloop from the back side and, surprisingly, does not contact the base of A149, which nevertheless is essential for complex formation [28]. On the other hand, G147 of the tetraloop, which is tightly imbedded in the protein­RNA interface, makes pseudoWatson­Crick interactions with two water molecules and the phosphate oxygen of G150, and is a beautiful example of water-mediated protein­RNA recognition (Figure 5c). The base of G147 stacks with an arginine sidechain, which would sterically interfere with the conformation of a normal GNRA-type tetraloop. In addition, the phosphoribose backbone of the remaining three stacking nucleotides of the tetraloop (148GAG) is completely buried in the protein­RNA interface, thus stabilising the open conformation of the tetraloop. The conformation of the SRP19-bound GGAG tetraloop is also different from that of the GAAG tetraloop observed in the complex of ribosomal protein S15 with helix 23a of 16S rRNA [29·]. S15 has rather few interactions with the tetraloop, which has a conformation closer to that of the classical GNRA-type tetraloop. In the complex of HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein bound to the SL3 stem-loop recognition element, which contains a GGAG tetraloop with an adjacent widened major groove, the tetraloop fold is completely different again, showing complete unstacking of the bases [30]. In general, it seems that the occurrence of the GNAR-type tetraloop is coupled with direct protein recognition and with the need for a more flexible conformation than the more common and rigid GNRA-type tetraloop can provide. SRP19 not only recognises the tetraloop, but also binds to the adjacent and extremely wide major groove of the RNA using its extended loop regions (L1 and L3; Figure 5c). The distortion of the A-RNA helix originates from a tandem A·C/C·A mismatch and a G·U wobble base pair, all opening towards the major groove [26]. The tip of loop L1 contains the most conserved sequence motif in the SRP19 family, with the fingerprint 31EGRR. The high conservation is well explained by the complex organisation

of the motif, with the two arginines being completely embedded in the hydrogen-bonding network and stretching in opposite directions to span the whole major groove of the RNA (Figure 5c).

Assembly of the S-domain of the mammalian SRP
The assembly of the eukaryotic SRP is known to be a sequential process, with five of the six protein subunits binding to SRP RNA in the nucleus, leaving SRP54 to be recruited in the cytosol to form a functional particle [31]. The binding of SRP19 to SRP RNA is a prerequisite to the binding of SRP54 to helix 8 of SRP RNA [3]; it involves an SRP19-induced conformational change in the S-domain of the SRP RNA [32], the structural basis of which has, hitherto, remained unclear. How can we understand the complex reorganisation of the S-domain of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP RNAs? It has been shown earlier that the principal binding site of SRP19 is helix 6, but that the protein has another binding site at the distal part of helix 8 [28]. A critical function of SRP19, therefore, could be to clamp the rigid helices 6 and 8 parallel to each other in a defined register. The crystal structure of the SRP19­helix 6 complex provides some evidence for this hypothesis. In the crystal, the SRP19­helix 6 complex is in intimate contact with a symmetry-related RNA molecule that could mimic the interaction with helix 8. This crystal contact can be used to model a putative S-domain complex by the rigid docking of the crystal structure of the E. coli Ffh M-domain­helix 8 complex onto the human SRP19­helix 6 structure (Figure 6). According to this model, the solvent-exposed bases of the GGAG tetraloop of helix 6 interact with the tip of helix 8, with A149 of helix 6 forming a putative base triple in the minor groove of a C·G base pair, giving perhaps the real rationale for the strict conservation of this adenosine. Such a contact has been observed, for instance, in the hammerhead ribozyme crystal structure [33]. In order to explain how the helix 6­helix 8 interaction permits the binding of SRP54, a second rearrangement has to be postulated. This might occur at the short strand of the asymmetric bulge of helix 8, using the same principle of an adenosine­minor groove RNA­RNA tertiary interaction (A-minor motif [34·,35·]). In the human 7SL RNA, there are at least two unpaired adenosines facing the minor groove of two G·C base pairs of helix 6 in the assembled S-domain model. Footprint data on the adenosines show that the N1 positions become protected [36·] and the N7 position accessible [37·], as would be predicted if base triples formed in the minor groove. The formation of such base triples could result in a reorganisation of the asymmetric loop of helix 8, which might be crucial to the subsequent binding of the M-domain of SRP54. Although this model explains most of the footprint data, a detailed explanation of the observed induced fit needs crystallographic confirmation from the structure of the ternary SRP19­SRP54­SRP RNA complex. Interestingly,

Towards the structure of the mammalian SRP. The known crystal structures of SRP components have been assembled and schematically placed in the envelope of an electron microscopy image obtained for the mammalian SRP (top left) [18]. The model of the complete Alu domain is based on crystallographic [6··] and biochemical studies [11·]. The rationale for the relative orientation between the SRP19­helix 6 complex and the Ffh M-domain­domain IV (helix 8) structure is based on crystallographic

[8··] and biochemical footprint [36·,37·] data. The positions of SRP68/72 and the Ffh NG domain with respect to the other structures are hypothetical; SRP68/72 could equally well be partially located in the central domain in the electron microscopy image. The organisation of the central part of the SRP RNA is unknown (the missing RNA of about 170 nucleotides is sketched as a dashed double line), as is the exact position of the Alu and S-domain boundary.

in the case of archaea, Ffh can bind to the RNA in the absence of SRP19 [38]; the most likely reason for this is the different structure of the asymmetric loop of helix 8 compared with the mammalian RNA. Elegant time-resolved footprinting studies have recently shown that SRP19 binding not only induces a conformational switch, but also involves obligatory intermediates [36·]. Using chemical footprinting, three steps in the assembly process were distinguished. In a first encounter complex, the binding of SRP19 aligns helix 6 and helix 8, and induces protection in the central parts of the two RNA helices. The assembly of the native complex then involves two subsequent processes of structural consolidation, which affect mainly the distal ends of the RNA helices, but also reorganise both the asymmetric and symmetric loops of RNA helix 8 to allow high-affinity binding of SRP54.

RNA structure. Also, there are architectural RNA-binding proteins that are crucial for guiding the frequently hierarchical RNP assembly pathways. These assembly proteins can be `clamps', which favour the close packing, often in parallel alignment, of distant RNA helices; `organisers', which include proteins that bind to helix junctions in order to induce the coaxial stacking of helices and/or in order to fix the relative angles between helical stacks; or `gluing proteins', which can sandwich between distant RNA elements without necessarily leading to direct RNA­RNA interactions. Assembly proteins can determine or fix the relative orientations of large RNA helices and therefore can induce conformational rearrangements that are much larger than those commonly observed within proteins. In the rearranged RNA, new RNA­RNA tertiary interactions, notably A-minor interactions [34·,35·], stabilise the RNP further. Clearly, a given protein could have more than one of the above-described attributes. Within the SRP, there are two architectural RNA binders: SRP19 and the heterodimer SRP9/14. SRP19 acts as a clamp, bringing stem-tetraloops 6 and 8 within the S-domain RNA into parallel alignment in a strictly defined register. This conformation is then stabilised by tertiary RNA­RNA interactions, which, at the same time, lead to the conformational readjustments in helix 8 that permit SRP54 binding. SRP54 clips on the functions of signal peptide binding and, via the NG domain, the ability to

Conclusions: the classification of RNA-binding proteins within stable RNPs
There is an enormous diversity of RNA-binding proteins, but one division that can be made is those that transiently interact with their RNA substrate (e.g. to copy, cut, modify or unwind it) and those that bind RNA permanently as part of stable RNPs (e.g. the ribosome, SRP, U snRNPs). Amongst the second group are proteins that `clip' a required protein-based function to a specific site on an RNA, often with only minor local induced-fit adjustments of the

interact with the SRP receptor and the ribosome, as well as regulatory GTPase activity. However, it has been suggested that both the signal peptide binding and receptor binding activities of SRP54 also depend on the RNA [7··,39,40], which could be one rationale for the universal conservation of the RNA in the SRP (with the exception of chloroplast SRP [41]). SRP9/14 acts both as an organiser and as a clamp. It stabilises the arrangement of the three-way -junction in the Alu RNA 5 domain and clamps together, within its concave -sheet surface, the 5 domain and 3 stem. In the eukaryotic SRP, the SRP68/72 heterodimer remains the most mysterious element, both structurally and functionally. This is largely because these proteins are notoriously difficult to express in soluble form. In the terms of this paragraph, it will be very interesting to see whether the SRP68/72 heterodimer plays a role in SRP assembly, possibly affecting the relative orientations of the Alu and S domains, and/or exactly what other functions are clipped on. Finally, it will be important to investigate dynamic aspects of the various RNA­protein interactions within SRP during its functional cycle.

Weichenrieder O, Wild K, Strub K, Cusack S: Structure and assembly of the Alu domain of the mammalian signal recognition particle. Nature 2000, 408:167-173. Two crystal structures of the human SRP9/14 protein heterodimer with, respectively, 50 and 88 nucleotides of Alu RNA reveal the structural organisation and the assembly of the SRP Alu domain. It provides a structural basis to investigate the mechanism of SRP-mediated `elongation arrest' and the completely unrelated mechanism of Alu retroposition that is responsible for the creation of 10% of genomic DNA in primates. Batey RT, Rambo RP, Lucast L, Rha B, Doudna JA: Crystal structure of the ribonucleoprotein core of the signal recognition particle. Science 2000, 287:1232-1239. The crystal structure of one of the most conserved RNA­protein complexes in biology provides a very high resolution view of water- and ion-mediated RNA­protein recognition. The structure suggests that the RNA participates in signal sequence recognition. Wild K, Sinning I, Cusack S: Crystal structure of an early protein RNA assembly complex of the signal recognition particle. Science 2001, 294:598-601. This high-resolution structure reveals a new variation of a small RNA-binding domain and its interaction with an unusual GNAR tetraloop. It highlights the importance of water molecules in protein­RNA interfaces and leads to an assembly model for the core of the mammalian SRP. 9.

Update
An important next step towards understanding the structure and assembly of the SRP has recently been taken with the structure determination of a complex between archaeal SRP19 and either the S-domain of archaeal SRP RNA (T Hainzl, E Sauer-Eriksson et al., personal communication) or the S-domain of human SRP RNA (C Oubridge, K Nagai et al., personal communication). These two structures are in general accordance with the assembly model proposed by Wild and co-workers [8··], but of course provide further detailed insight into the exact protein­RNA and RNA­RNA interactions involved, and how this promotes subsequent binding of SRP54/Ffh.
