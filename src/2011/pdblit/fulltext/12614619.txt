(PDZ domains are so called because they were initially recognized as sequence repeats in PSD-95, Dlg, and a tight junction protein ZO-1; they are also known as DHR or discs large homology regions.) In addition, this family of proteins contains an SH3 domain and a guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain in their C-terminal region (Figure 1), a domain organization characteristic of the MAGUK superfamily of cell junction-associated proteins (Kim, 1995). PDZ domains have been shown to bind selectively to short peptide motifs at the very C-terminus of proteins (Sheng and Kim, 1996; Doyle et al., 1996; Songyang et al., 1997). The N-terminal two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2) of the PSD-95 family of proteins recognize a four amino acid consensus sequence (-E-S/T-D-V) found at the C-terminus of certain ion channel subunits, including Shaker-type K channels and NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor (Kim et al., 1995; Kornau et al., 1995; Niethammer et al., 1996). PSD-95 colocalizes with Shaker K channels and with NMDA receptors in rat central neurons, but more importantly from a functional point of view, coexpression of PSD-95 (or its relative chapsyn110/PSD-93) can cause the clustering of Shaker-family K channels and NMDA receptors in heterologous cells (Kim et al., 1995, 1996). Evidence for an ion channel clustering function in vivo has been provided by genetic analysis of Discs large (Dlg), the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian PSD95 family of proteins. Dlg also binds and clusters Shaker channels in vitro and colocalizes with Shaker in larval neuromuscular junctions in vivo (Tejedor et al., 1997). More significantly, the normal synaptic clustering of Shaker is abolished in Dlg loss-of-function mutants (Tejedor et al., 1997). Taken together, the biochemical, cell biological, and genetic evidence argue that the Dlg/ PSD-95 family of proteins is directly involved in the clustering and localization of specific classes of voltagegated and ligand-gated ion channels at synaptic sites. Beyond the requirement for PDZ domains to bind to the C-terminal tails of ion channels, virtually nothing is known about how PSD-95 clusters its ion channel binding partners. The mechanism of clustering by PDZ-containing proteins is important to understand because PDZ domains are found singly or multiply in a wide variety of cell junction-associated and developmentally important proteins, including ZO-1, p55, syntrophin, and disheveled. Some of these proteins, in particular LIN-2 and LIN-7, have also been implicated in the localization and clustering of their membrane protein ligands (Kim, 1995; Simske et al., 1996). The oligomeric subunit structure of ion channels (tetramers in the case of Shaker channels), and the fact that each PSD-95 polypeptide contains two independent (PDZ1 and PDZ2) domains capable of binding to each ion channel subunit, have suggested a simple model for the mechanism of clustering by PSD-95. In this cross-linking model, the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains of PSD-95 allow it to bivalently link together ion channels

Summary The PSD-95/SAP90 family of PDZ-containing proteins is directly involved in the clustering of specific ion channels at synapses. We report that channel clustering depends on a conserved N-terminal domain of PSD-95 that mediates multimerization and disulfide linkage of PSD-95 protomers. This N-terminal multimerization domain confers channel clustering activity on a single PDZ domain. Thus, channel clustering depends on aggregation of PDZ domains achieved by head-to-head multimerization of PSD-95, rather than by concatenation of PDZ domains in PSD-95 monomers. This mechanism predicts that PSD-95 can organize heterogeneous membrane protein clusters via differential binding specificities of its three PDZ domains. PSD-95 and its relative chapsyn-110 exist as disulfidelinked complexes in rat brain, consistent with headto-head multimerization of these proteins in vivo. Introduction In neurons, ion channels and receptors are not diffusely distributed on the neuronal surface but are typically clustered and localized at specific subcellular sites, such as synapses and nodes of Ranvier (Froehner, 1993). Clustering of ion channels is important for concentrating current flux across a small area of membrane (e.g., voltage-gated Na channels at nodes of Ranvier) and for maximizing responses to local neurotransmitter release (e.g., ligand-gated ion channels at postsynaptic sites). Moreover, changes in distribution and density of channels and receptors may play a role in long-term synaptic plasticity and information storage in the brain. Thus, the mechanisms of channel clustering are relevant to nervous system function as well as of fundamental cell biological interest. Recently, the PSD-95/SAP90 subfamily of MAGUK proteins (for membrane-associated guanylate kinases) has been directly implicated in the synaptic clustering of several classes of neuronal ion channels. The PSD95 family to date contains four highly related mammalian proteins: the prototypical member PSD-95/SAP90 (Cho et al., 1992; Kistner et al., 1993); SAP97/hdlg (Lue et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1995); chapsyn-110/PSD-93 (Bren¨ man et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1996); and SAP102 (Muller et ¨ al., 1996). In their N-terminal half, this family of proteins is characterized by three PDZ domains that function as

in a raft-like cluster in the membrane (Gomperts, 1996; Sheng and Kim, 1996). This model also neatly explains why neither PSD-95 nor ion channel alone can form clusters in the absence of the other (Kim et al., 1995, 1996). In this study, we demonstrate that PSD-95 requires just a single functional PDZ domain to cluster its ion channel ligand, but that by itself, a single PDZ domain is not sufficient. In addition, a conserved N-terminal selfassociation domain is required to mediate disulfidelinked head-to-head multimerization of PSD-95, thereby generating channel cross-linking capability. Results A series of myc epitope-tagged deletion mutants of PSD-95 were constructed to test the domain requirements for ion channel clustering by PSD-95 in heterologous cells (summarized in Figure 1A). The expression of these constructs at the protein level was compared with wild-type PSD-95 by immunoblotting with anti-myc epitope antibodies (Figure 1B). A Single PDZ Domain Is Sufficient for Clustering The full-length myc-tagged PSD-95 formed striking plaque-like coclusters with Shaker-type Kv1.4 K channels in 70% of cotransfected COS-7 cells (Figure 2), behaving indistinguishably from wild-type PSD-95 in this respect (Kim et al., 1995, 1996). Deletion of any single PDZ domain ( PDZ1, PDZ2, or PDZ3) from PSD-95 had no effect on clustering efficiency. Moreover, a double PDZ domain deletion mutant lacking both PDZ2 and PDZ3 and the intervening sequence ( PDZ23) could also cluster Kv1.4 at wild-type efficiency (Figure 1A). Since the remaining PDZ1 domain in the PDZ23 mutant can bind to the Kv1.4 C-terminal ETDV motif (though with lower affinity than PDZ2), this result indicates that only a single functional PDZ domain is required for clustering by PSD-95. Unfortunately, we were unable to test whether PSD-95 can mediate clustering after deletion of both PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains because the PDZ12 mutant construct did not express (Figures 1A and 1B). All of the above constructs contain the SH3 and GK domains that are conserved in the PSD-95 family of clustering molecules and in the superfamily of MAGUK proteins. However, neither deletion of the GK domain alone ( GK), nor deletion of the SH3 and the GK domains together ( SHGK), had a significant effect on clustering activity (Figure 1A). Thus, the GK and SH3 domains are dispensable for clustering by PSD-95. More significantly, further deletions from the C-terminal side that truncated PDZ3 and PDZ2 did not abolish clustering activity. Thus, N-terminal region constructs of PSD-95 containing just PDZ1 and PDZ2 (N-PDZ12 and N-PDZ12S) were as effective at Kv1.4 clustering as the full-length PSD-95 (Figures 1, 2A, and 2B). Surprisingly, the construct N-PDZ1 (containing only PDZ1 and the upstream N-terminal segment of PSD-95) could also cluster, though with slightly reduced efficiency (Figure 1A). A similar construct in which the N-terminal segment is attached to a single PDZ2 domain (N-PDZ2) had clustering activity comparable to full-length PSD-95 (Figures

1 and 2C). Qualitatively similar results were obtained by assaying the ability of these PSD-95 deletion constructs to cluster NMDA receptor (NR2) subunits (data not shown). The C-terminal -ETDV motif of Kv1.4 is critical for recognition by the PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains, and mutation of the terminal valine to alanine abolishes Kv1.4 binding and clustering by PSD-95 (Kim et al., 1995; Kim and Sheng, 1996). The Kv1.4(ETDA) mutant similarly cannot be clustered by the PSD-95 deletion constructs N-PDZ12, N-PDZ1, and N-PDZ2 (Figure 2D, and data not shown). Thus, the channel clustering activity of these compact PSD-95 molecules still depends on their ability to bind to the C-terminal tails of the channel protein. Taken together with the clustering ability of the PDZ23 mutant, these data indicate that only a single functional PDZ domain is required for channel clustering by PSD-95. The N-Terminal Segment of PSD-95 Is Required for Clustering The most compact PSD-95 constructs capable of clustering Kv1.4 (namely N-PDZ1 and N-PDZ2) contain, in addition to their PDZ domain, the N-terminal segment of PSD-95 (residues 1­64) that lies immediately N-terminal to PDZ1 in the native PSD-95 polypeptide. To test whether this N-terminal segment (henceforth termed ``N-segment'') is important for clustering activity, we deleted residues 10­64 from N-PDZ1, N-PDZ2, and N-PDZ12, while leaving intact the first nine amino acids after the translation start site and the myc tag (generating deletion constructs PDZ1, PDZ2, and PDZ12, respectively; see Figure 1A). Without an attached N-segment, neither PDZ2 nor PDZ12 constructs could cluster Kv1.4 K channels, despite efficient expression of these mutant proteins (Figures 2E and 2F). Thus, the highly efficient clustering activity of N-PDZ2 and N-PDZ12 depends on their upstream N-terminal segment. Unfortunately, deletion of the N-segment from N-PDZ1 resulted in a nonexpressing mutant, so PDZ1 alone could not be tested. A significant finding is that although it could not cluster, PDZ12 without the N-segment could still bind to Kv1.4, since the Kv1.4 protein could be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with PDZ12 from the cotransfected cells (Figure 2, inset). Thus, the N-segment is critical for clustering but not for binding to the K channel, the latter function being accomplished by the PDZ domains. Furthermore, the fact that PDZ12 can bind but cannot cluster Kv1.4 indicates that tandem PDZ1 and PDZ2 domains by themselves cannot cluster K channels, as might be predicted from a simple bivalent cross-linking model. N-PSD-95, a construct in which just the N-segment is deleted from full-length PSD-95, also showed sharply reduced clustering efficiency (5%) compared with wildtype PSD-95 ( 70%), despite high expression levels (Figure 1A). This result indicates that the N-terminal segment is also important for ion channel clustering by the full-length PSD-95 polypeptide. The N-Segment Mediates Multimerization The finding that only a single PDZ domain is required for clustering renders untenable the clustering model

Each pair of images ([A1­A2], [B1­B2], etc.) represents the same cell examined by double-label immunofluorescence; the labeled protein is shown in the color emitted by the secondary antibody (Kv1.4, red/Cy3; PSD-95, green/FITC). Full-length PSD-95 (A), N-PDZ12 (B), and N-PDZ2 (C) form coclusters efficiently with Kv1.4. N-PDZ2 cannot form clusters with Kv1.4 TDA, a mutant of Kv1.4 in which the terminal valine residue has been mutated to alanine (D). Without the N-segment, PDZ12 (E) and PDZ2 (F) cannot form clusters with Kv1.4. The asterisk in (C2) indicates a cell singly transfected with N-PDZ2. Inset: PDZ12 binds to Kv1.4. COS-7 cells transfected with PDZ12 or Kv1.4, or both, were immunoprecipitated with antiPSD-95 antibodies HM319 (IP), and the immunoprecipitates were Western blotted for Kv1.4 and PDZ12. The far right lane shows Kv1.4 coimmunoprecipitated with PDZ12 from cotransfected cells. Input lanes are loaded directly with 10% of the cell extract used for the immunoprecipitation.

based on cross-linking of channels by concatenated PDZs in a single PSD-95 polypeptide. A rafting mechanism for clustering of multimeric channels, however, could still be accomplished by a single PDZ domain per PSD95 monomer if PSD-95 self-associates to form multimers. Since PDZ domains bind Kv1.4 but cannot cluster the K channel unless they are linked to the N-terminal segment, we tested the hypothesis that the N-segment acts as a multimerization domain. N-PDZ1 and N-PDZ12 cannot be recognized by antibodies (termed ``PSD-95-CSK'') directed against the SH3 domain of PSD-95, since these deletion constructs have lost the SH3 domain (see Figure 1A). As expected, N-PDZ12 expressed by itself in COS cells is not immunoprecipitated by PSD-95-CSK antibodies (Figure 3, left). When cotransfected with full-length PSD-95, however, N-PDZ1 and N-PDZ12 were readily coimmunoprecipitated by CSK antibodies along with the full-length PSD-95 protein (Figure 3, left). This result indicates that full-length PSD-95 forms a complex with N-PDZ1 and N-PDZ12. In contrast, CSK antibodies were unable to coimmunoprecipitate the PDZ12 mutant construct lacking the N-segment when it was coexpressed with fulllength PSD-95 (Figure 3, right). The requirement for the N-segment for coimmunoprecipitation suggests that the N-segment mediates homomeric association between PSD-95 polypeptides.

To test directly if the N-segment can act as a multimerization domain, we characterized the biochemical behavior of hexahistidine fusion proteins of the isolated N-segment (N-H6) and of N-PDZ1 (N-PDZ1-H6) and N-PDZ12 (N-PDZ12-H 6). Soluble purified fusion proteins N-H6, N-PDZ1-H6, and N-PDZ12-H6 at concentrations ranging from 0.6­30 M could be readily cross-linked by glutaraldehyde to form a slower-migrating species of approximately twice the molecular size of the uncrosslinked species (Figure 4A). At higher concentrations of glutaraldehyde (or with longer incubation times (data not shown), even higher molecular weight bands could be detected. These higher order complexes were particularly prominent with N-H6 (Figure 4A). No glutaraldehyde cross-linking was observed with N-PDZ12 (C3S/C5S)-H6, a mutant form of N-PDZ12-H6 in which two N-terminal cysteines are mutated to serine (Figure 4A). (The involvement of these cysteines in N-segmentmediated aggregation is addressed in a later section.) These chemical cross-linking data using purified proteins provide direct evidence that the N-segment of PSD-95 can form a multimeric complex in solution. To obtain more biochemical evidence for multimerization of the N-segment, we performed sucrose density gradient centrifugation on the purified recombinant N-PDZ12-H6 protein. N-PDZ12-H6 fusion protein was concentrated in a peak near the top of the gradient. A

Figure 3. Coimmunoprecipitation Depends on the N-Segment COS-7 cells were transfected with full-length PSD-95 and with various deletion constructs of PSD-95 (all myc tagged), as indicated, and then immunoprecipitated with PSD-95-CSK antibodies directed against the SH3 domain of PSD-95. The precipitation of PSD-95 and deletion variants were then assayed by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibodies. Input lanes are loaded with 10% of the extract used for the immunoprecipitation. N-PDZ12 and N-PDZ1 cannot be directly precipitated by CSK antibodies but are coimmunoprecipitated in the presence of full-length PSD-95. In contrast, PDZ12 cannot be coimmunoprecipitated with full-length PSD-95.

significant fraction of N-PDZ12-H6, however, was distributed all the way to the bottom of the gradient, indicating that faster sedimenting complexes of N-PDZ12-H6 were formed (Figure 4B, left). Similar results were obtained with N-H6 fusion protein (data not shown). The lack of recognizable peaks toward the bottom of the gradient may reflect the low resolution of the gradient or dynamic instability of the complex under the conditions employed. Significantly, the cysteine mutant N-PDZ12 (C3S/C5S)-H6 was found exclusively in the peak near the top of the gradient (Figure 4B, right). This control result indicates that the `bleeding' of N-PDZ12-H6 into the bottom of the sucrose gradient reflects specific aggregation of N-PDZ12-H6 and furthermore that aggregation depends on cysteine-3 and -5 of the N-segment. Taken together with the N-segment requirement for coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 3), these cross-linking and sucrose sedimentation data indicate that the N-segment can function as a self-association domain to mediate multimerization of PSD-95. The N-Segment Confers Specific PSD-95/chapsyn-110 Binding to Heterologous Proteins We were unable to obtain stable expression of the N-segment alone in COS-7 cells, perhaps due to its small size. However, a chimeric protein (N-GFP), consisting of green fluorescent protein fused to the C-terminus of the N-segment of PSD-95, was efficiently expressed and

furthermore offered a way to visualize the N-segment in transfected cells. N-GFP does not have channel clustering activity when coexpressed with Kv1.4 (data not shown). When coexpressed with PSD-95, N-GFP is coimmunoprecipitated by PSD-95-CSK antibodies (Figure 5A), while native GFP without the N-segment cannot be coimmunoprecipitated with PSD-95 or any other member of the PSD-95 family (data not shown). This indicates that the N-segment can confer on a heterologous protein (GFP) the ability to bind to PSD-95 and further supports the idea that the N-segment functions as a modular multimerization domain. PSD-95 can form heteromultimers with its close relative chapsyn-110 but not with another member of the family, SAP97 (Kim et al., 1996). In this context, it is interesting that upon coexpression in COS cells, N-GFP can be coimmunoprecipitated with chapsyn-110 using chapsyn-110-specific antibodies but not with SAP97 using SAP97 antibodies (Figure 5A). Thus, the N-segment of PSD-95 can confer on a heterologous protein the ability to associate with PSD-95 or chapsyn-110 but not with SAP97. These results indicate that the N-segment can function with specificity as a homo- and heteromultimerization domain. Dominant-Negative Activity of N-Segment If the N-segment acts as a multimerization domain, and if multimerization of PSD-95 is important in the mechanism of channel clustering, then overexpression of the

N-segment (either in isolation or on an unrelated heterologous protein) would be predicted to interfere with channel clustering by PSD-95. N-GFP was used to test whether the N-segment can have dominant interfering activity on clustering by PSD95. Cotransfection of N-GFP greatly inhibited Kv1.4 clustering by N-PDZ12. In cells expressing N-GFP (identified by GFP fluorescence), there was a marked reduction in the percentage of cells showing typical plaque-like clusters ( 2 m diameter) of Kv1.4 and N-PDZ12, compared with cells cotransfected with control GFP (Figure 5B). N-GFP also significantly inhibited channel clustering by full-length PSD-95, though the effect was smaller than that seen with N-PDZ12 (Figure 5B). In a small fraction of cells that showed low levels of expression of N-GFP, N-GFP fluorescence actually colocalized with Kv1.4/PSD-95 coclusters (data not shown), as might be predicted if the N-segment mediated recruitment of N-GFP to PSD-95 complexes. The dominant-negative activity of N-GFP versus GFP confirms the importance of N-segment-mediated multimerization in the mechanism of channel clustering by PSD-95. Sequence Similarity in the N-Segments of PSD-95 and chapsyn An amino acid alignment of PSD-95, chapsyn-110, and SAP97 in the N-terminal region preceding the PDZ1 domain shows that there is extensive sequence similarity

in this region (Figure 6). A striking difference is that SAP97 has a long N-terminal extension ( 90 residues) preceding the segment that is similar to the N-segment of PSD-95. Also notable are a conserved pair of cysteine residues near the N-terminus of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110. To test whether these N-terminal cysteines are involved in multimerization and in clustering by PSD-95, we mutated these to serine, individually and in combination, in either the background of N-PDZ12s or full-length PSD-95. Serine substitution of either cysteine-3 (C3S) or cysteine-5 (C5S) in N-PDZ12S completely abolished association of N-PDZ12S with full-length PSD-95, as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation with PSD-95-CSK antibodies (Figure 7A). Not surprisingly, the double cysteine mutant (C3S/C5S) also could not form a coimmunoprecipitable complex with full-length PSD-95. Identical results were obtained when these cysteine substitution mutants were assayed for binding to full-length chapsyn-110 (Figure 7A). Thus, both cysteine-3 and cysteine-5 in the N-terminal region of PSD-95 are essential for multimerization with PSD-95 or with chapsyn-110. Cysteine substitution in the N-segment also abolished channel clustering activity of PSD-95. C3S, C5S, and C3S/C5S mutants of N-PDZ12S could not cluster Kv1.4, while ``wild-type'' N-PDZ12S was as effective as fulllength PSD-95 (summarized in Figure 7B). Similarly, C3S, C5S, and C3S/C5S substitutions abolished the channel

COS-7 cells were transfected with combinations of N-GFP and PSD-95, chapsyn-110 (all myc tagged), or SAP97, as indicated. Extracts were then immunoprecipitated with PSD-95, chapsyn, or SAP97-specific antibodies, and the precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-myc antibodies (for PSD-95, chapsyn-110, and N-GFP) or SAP97-specific antibodies. Input lanes were loaded with 10% of extract used for immunoprecipitation. N-GFP can be coimmunoprecipitated with PSD-95, chapsyn-110, but not with SAP97.

clustering activity of full-length PSD-95 (Figure 7B). All cysteine substitution mutants were expressed comparably to the wild type (Figures 7A and 8A). Hence, both N-terminal cysteines are required for channel clustering activity as well as multimerization. This correlation reinforces the conclusion that multimerization via the N-segment is important in the mechanism of channel clustering by PSD-95. Disulfide-Linked Multimers of PSD-95 In Vivo The requirement for two conserved cysteines for N-segment-mediated association raised the possibility that

these cysteine residues mediate intermolecular disulfide linkage between monomers of PSD-95 or between monomers of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110. If that is the case, covalently linked multimers of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 should be present in cells and may be detectable as higher molecular weight species by SDS­PAGE in nonreducing conditions. In COS-7 cells expressing PSD-95, a PSD-95-immunoreactive band of molecular weight 300­350 kDa was detected after SDS­PAGE in nonreducing conditions (Figure 8A). This band was absent in COS cells expressing the C3S, C5S, or the combined C3S/C5S mutants

of PSD-95. A weak band of 180 kDa was also detectable in cells expressing wild-type PSD-95 or the single cysteine substitutions (C3S and C5S) but was absent in cells expressing the double mutant (C3S/C5S). Both these higher molecular weight bands of PSD-95 (300­ 350 kDa and 180 kDa) were completely absent in immunoblots performed in reducing conditions (Figure 8A).

In control experiments, the higher molecular weight bands of PSD-95 were still equally abundant if the cell extracts were prepared in the presence of N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) to inactivate reduced sulfhydryl groups (data not shown). These results suggest that disulfidelinked complexes containing PSD-95 exist in cells and that these complexes did not form artifactually upon

COS-7 cells transfected with wild-type or cysteine-substitution mutants of PSD-95 were immunoblotted for PSD-95 after SDS­PAGE in nonreducing or in reducing conditions. In nonreducing conditions, PSD-95 is detectable in a band of 300­350 kDa (open arrowhead) and in a weak band of 180 kDa (asterisk). Identical results were obtained when cell extracts were prepared in the presence of NEM. (B) Disulfide-linked complexes of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 in rat brain. Rat forebrain membranes were immunoblotted for PSD-95 or chapsyn110 after SDS­PAGE in nonreducing conditions (N) or in reducing conditions (R). In nonreducing conditions, a high molecular weight band of PSD-95 and of chapsyn is prominent (open arrowheads), while in reducing conditions, both proteins run at the monomeric size (arrowheads).

oxidation of sulfhydryl groups during preparation of cell lysates. It is notable that the size of the unreduced bands of PSD-95 (300­350 kDa and 180 kDa) are roughly consistent with the predicted molecular weight of the tetramer and dimer of PSD-95. Supporting this idea is the effect of cysteine substitution on the pattern of the PSD95 bands detected in nonreducing conditions. Both C-3 and C-5 are required for formation of the 300­350 kDa band (putative tetramer), whereas either one of these cysteines appears to suffice for formation of the 180 kDa band (putative dimer). To examine the disulfide-linked multimerization state of native PSD-95 in brain, nonreducing immunoblots were performed of rat cortical membranes. The majority of unreduced PSD-95 in brain was of 300­350 kDa in size, comigrating with the band seen in transfected COS cells (Figure 8B, and data not shown). Only a faint band could be detected at 95 kDa, presumably reflecting the PSD-95 monomer. In reducing conditions, the 300­ 350 kDa band disappeared, and all PSD-95 immunoreactivity was found at 95 kDa (Figure 8B). Similarly, chapsyn-110 in rat brain membranes was detected in a higher molecular weight band ( 400 kDa) in nonreducing conditions but only as a 110 kDa band in reducing conditions (Figure 8B). Thus, both PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 exist in brain largely as disulfide-linked complexes; the relative sizes of these complexes are

roughly compatible with tetrameric multimers of these proteins.

Discussion Head-to-Head Multimerization of PSD-95 We show here that the N-terminal region of PSD-95 preceding PDZ1 is required for both multimerization and channel clustering activity of PSD-95. The isolated N-segment can directly self-associate, and when attached to the N-terminal side of a heterologous protein (GFP), it can confer PSD-95 binding and dominantly interfere with PSD-95 channel clustering activity. Taken together, these findings indicate that N-segment-mediated multimerization is critical for the mechanism of channel clustering by PSD-95. We will refer to this N-segment-mediated multimerization as head-to-head multimerization. The involvement of disulfide bonds in head-to-head multimerization of PSD-95 is reminiscent of the mechanism of dimerization of the regulatory subunits of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which are formed by two interchain disulfide bonds that link the N-terminal regions of each protomer (Zick and Taylor, 1982). Our evidence that disulfide bonds link PSD-95 protomers in vivo represents another example of interchain disulfide linkage occurring in intracellular proteins. Moreover,

given the relative abundance of PSD-95 and its relatives in the postsynaptic density, our findings can account, at least in part, for the biochemical observations of Cotman and colleagues, who noted that PSD proteins exist in the brain as supramolecular aggregates cross-linked by disulfide bonds (Kelly and Cotman, 1977). The involvement of disulfide bonds in clustering of ion channels by PSD-95 raises the interesting possibility that the molecular organization of the PSD may be regulated by the local synaptic redox state. Redox regulation has been described for synaptic proteins such as calcineurin (Wang et al., 1996). Furthermore, synaptic activity stimulates oxidative activity, perhaps via generation of superoxide ions (Bito et al., 1996). Oxidative activity tends to stabilize disulfide bonds and could favor PSD95 multimerization and postsynaptic receptor­channel clustering, whereas synaptic inactivity might lead to PSD-95 dissociation and dispersal of PSD-95-associated channels and receptors. Whether such a mechanism can contribute to activity-dependent regulation of synaptic structure and function in central glutamatergic synapses remains to be investigated. An example of synaptic inactivity being correlated with loss of postsynaptic receptor density occurs during synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction (Colman et al., 1997).

forming channel clusters in vitro (Kim et al., 1996). SAP97, on the other hand, cannot associate with PSD95 and chapsyn-110 and is segregated from these proteins to presynaptic and axonal locations. The distinctive multimerization behavior of SAP97 may reflect different mechanisms of ion channel organization in axons compared with postsynaptic sites. The Mechanism of Clustering by PSD-95 A simple model in which multimeric ion channels are cross-linked by bivalent PDZs within a single polypeptide seems to be invalidated since PDZ12 (which contains two PDZ domains capable of binding to the ion channel C-terminal -ETDV motif) can bind but cannot cluster Kv1.4. Head-to-head multimerization, however, in effect renders PSD-95 multivalent with respect to each of its three PDZ domains. Hence, a cross-linking mechanism for generating a raft-like cluster of ion channels could still apply, except that in this case, crosslinking occurs via PDZ domains linked by multimerization rather than via PDZ domains concatenated in a single polypeptide (see Figure 9). Such a model can explain how constructs containing just a single PDZ domain can still cluster ion channels effectively, as long as that PDZ domain is attached to the N-segment. By extrapolation, proteins that naturally have only a single PDZ domain (e.g., p55, LIN-2/CASK, and LIN-7) may be able to aggregate their binding partners if they can undergo multimerization. The stoichiometry of multimerization mediated by the N-segment is an important point that remains to be confirmed, but our present data is consistent with this stoichiometry being 4. In nonreducing conditions, the major high molecular weight band of PSD-95 from transfected cells and from brain ran with a size consistent with a tetrameric complex of PSD-95, while a faint intermediate band had the mobility compatible with a PSD-95 dimer. A tetrameric stoichiometry is also supported by the requirement for two N-segment cysteine residues for multimerization. Substitution of a single one of these cysteines abolished the highest molecular weight complex (putative tetramer) while leaving intact the intermediate band of apparent dimeric size (Figure 8). The simplest model to explain these data envisages a head-to-head tetramerization in which the 4 N-segments are arranged with 4-fold rotational symmetry, each N-segment being linked to each of its 2 adjacent neighbors by a single disulfide bond (see Figure 9). Since just a single cysteine substitution abolishes clustering activity of PSD-95, we propose that dimerization is not sufficient, and that tetramerization is essential, for PSD95 clustering activity. The Significance of Multiple PDZ Domains in PSD-95 If a single PDZ domain (attached to the N-segment) can suffice for channel clustering by PSD-95, why are there three PDZ domains in each monomer of PSD-95 and its relatives? We hypothesize that the structure of PSD-95 has evolved to enable it to cluster a variety of membrane proteins that are defined by the distinctive binding specificities of its three PDZ domains. Consistent with the

Specificity of N-Segment Association An interesting observation is that the N-segment of PSD95 mediates association with chapsyn-110 in addition to PSD-95, implying that heteromultimerization of PSD95 with chapsyn-110 occurs through a similar head-tohead mechanism as that which mediates PSD-95 homomultimerization. Consistent with this idea is the great similarity in primary structure between the N-terminal regions of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110, including the two conserved cysteine residues. The PSD-95 N-segment cannot, however, interact with SAP97, another member of the PSD-95 family. In this regard, it is noteworthy that SAP97 contains a long N-terminal extension ( 90 amino acids) that precedes the region similar to the PSD-95/ chapsyn-110 N-segment (see Figure 6). Preliminary results indicate that the self-associative activity of the PSD-95 N-segment depends on it being at the N-terminus of a protein (Y. H., unpublished data); hence, the unique N-terminal extension of SAP97 might prevent it from forming multimers via a head-to-head binding mechanism. SAP97 has indistinguishable ion channel binding specificity from PSD-95 and chapsyn-110, but unlike PSD-95 and chapsyn-110, it cannot organize typical surface clusters of Kv1.4 in heterologous cells (Kim and Sheng, 1996). This correlation further supports the idea that head-to-head multimerization is central to the mechanism of channel clustering by PSD-95-like proteins. PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 are predominantly postsynaptic proteins that colocalize in glutamatergic synapses, while SAP97 is unique among this family in being presynaptic and axonal in location (Muller et al., 1995; Hunt ¨ et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1996). The ability of PSD-95 and chapsyn-110 to multimerize via head-to-head association is consistent with their common subcellular location in vivo and their ability to cooperate with each other in

Mechanism of Ion Channel Clustering by PSD-95 813

Figure 9. Model for Ion Channel Clustering by PSD-95 PSD-95 protomers are shown associated in head-to-head fashion via disulfide linkage of their N-segments. A tetrameric ion channel (e.g., Shaker K channel) is `rafted' into a surface aggregate by binding of its C-termini to the second PDZ domain (PDZ2). Only the PDZ2 interaction is shown, but given the differential binding specificities of the three PDZ domains, this model would allow PSD-95 to organize a heterogeneous cluster containing three different sets of membrane proteins. The ion channel clustering is represented in side view for illustrative convenience only. The inset at the right shows a `plan' view of head-to-head PSD-95 tetramers linked through their N-segments via disulfide bonds. Numbers refer to PDZ domains, shown in red.

idea of differential recognition by PSD-95 PDZ domains, we have identified a C-terminal sequence (-QTSV) that binds preferentially to PDZ3 rather than PDZ2 of PSD95 (Doyle et al., 1996). This is in contrast to the terminal -ETDV motif of Shaker K channels and NR2 subunits, which has highest affinity for PDZ2. Since multimerization of a single PDZ domain by the N-segment renders it capable of clustering its ligand ion channel, the multimerization of three independent distinct PDZ domains should allow PSD-95 in principle to cluster three different sets of membrane proteins that have the specific C-terminal motifs recognized by each individual PDZ domain. Incorporation of multiple PDZs in each protomer of PSD-95 represents therefore a potential mechanism by which this protein can organize a heterogeneous cluster of membrane proteins. In these mixed protein clusters, the nature of the different constituent proteins and their stoichiometric and spatial relationships can be defined simply by the specificity, number, and spacing of PDZ domains in each PSD-95 polypeptide.
Experimental Procedures DNA Constructions Kv1.4 and PSD-95 constructs in GW1-CMV mammalian expression vector have been described (Kim et al., 1995). To construct myctagged PSD-95, an AscI site was introduced between amino acid 9 and 10 in the PSD-95 cDNA by inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an oligonucleotide duplex encoding the myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) was inserted into the AscI site. PSD-95 deletion mutants (Figure 1) were constructed by inverse PCR using primers flanking the region of PSD-95 to be deleted. The DNA template for PCR generation of GK, SH3GK, NPDZ12, N-PDZ1, PDZ1, PDZ2, PDZ3, PDZ23, PDZ12, N, and N-PDZ12 was fulllength wild-type or myc-tagged GW1-PSD-95. For mutants PDZ2, N-PDZ2, and PDZ12, the template was GW1-N-PDZ12. For PDZ1, the template was GW1-N-PDZ1. KpnI or XbaI sites were incorporated at 5 ends of PCR primers. The inverse PCR products were digested with KpnI or XbaI and self-ligated, restoring the correct reading frame. For construction of N-GFP, myc-tagged N-segment (corresponding to residues 1­64 of PSD-95) was PCR amplified from myc-tagged GW1-PSD-95 with addition of EcoRI and XbaI sites at the N- and C-terminal ends of PCR product. The myc-tagged N-segment was inserted between EcoRI and SpeI sites of pGreen Lantern-1 vector (GIBCO), in which the stop codon at the SpeI site had been shifted out of frame by the insertion of one nucleotide between SpeI and

GFP start codon by inverse PCR. GFP and full-length N-GFP coding region were then PCR amplified and were inserted between KpnI and EcoRI sites of pGW1-CMV expression vector. N-terminal cysteine mutants of PSD-95 were synthesized by PCR using 5 PCR primer (corresponding to the first 20 nucleotides of PSD-95 coding sequence), in which a G to C substitution at the second position of the cysteine-3 or cysteine-5 codons, or both, was introduced. A stop codon was inserted in the 3 primer for translation termination. KpnI and EcoRI sites were created in the 5 and 3 primers. All PCR products were subcloned into KpnI and EcoRI sites of pGW1-CMV. To construct His-tagged fusion proteins, myc-N-PDZ12 and mycN-PDZ12(C3S/C5S) were PCR amplified from GW1-N-PDZ12 and GW1-N-PDZ12(C3S/C5S). myc-N-PDZ1 and myc-N were PCR amplified from GW1-N-PDZ1. All PCR products were subcloned between NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-22b (Novagen). The sequences of all PCR primers used in plasmid constructions for this study are available upon request. Cell Culture and Transfection COS-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 g/ml gentamycin. Before transfection, COS-7 cells were seeded on poly-lysine-coated multiwell slides for clustering assays or six-well plates for cell extract preparation and cultured overnight. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (GIBCO­ BRL) at 30%­40% confluence for clustering experiments or at 60%­ 70% confluence for cell extract preparation. Two days after transfection, the cells were stained by specific antibodies or harvested for preparing cell extracts. Cells were scored positive for clustering if they showed multiple plaque-like clusters of 2 m in diameter. Antibodies, Immunoblotting, Immunocytochemistry, and Immunoprecipitation PSD-95-specific antibodies (guinea pig HM319 and rabbit CSK antibodies) and chapsyn-110 antibodies have been described previously (Kim et al., 1995, 1996), as have Kv1.4 antibodies (Sheng et al., 1992). Myc tag­specific monclonal antibodies 9E10 were purchased from Santa Cruz. For immunocytochemistry, PSD-95 antibodies HM319 and Kv1.4 antibodies were used in double staining as described previously (Kim et al., 1995). For immunoblotting, transfected cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors. For disulfide bond studies, NEM was added to RIPA buffer to a final concentration of 10 mM. After incubation at 4 C for 1 hr, insoluble fractions of cell lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Immunoblotting with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents was performed as described (Sheng et al., 1993), except that affinity-purified primary antibodies were used at 0.2 g/ml. For immunoprecipitation, specific antibodies were added to RIPA cell lysates (final concentration: 2­4 g/ml) and incubated at 4 C

Neuron 814

for 2 hr, followed by protein A sepharose (Pharmacia) for 2 more hr. Immunoprecipitates were washed, separated by SDS­PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Glutaraldehyde Cross-Linking of His-Tagged Fusion Proteins His-tagged fusion proteins were purified by Ni­NTA chromatography and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mM EDTA. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed as described (Craig, 1982) with some modifications. Gutaraldehyde (0­10 mM final concentration) was added to fusion proteins (in a range of concentrations from 0.6­30 M in different experiments). Following a 2 min incubation at room temperature, the reactions were quenched by the addition of glycine. The cross-linked products were separated by SDS­PAGE, and then analyzed by Coomassie blue staining or Western blotting with anti-myc antibody 9E10. Sucrose Gradient Sedimentation This procedure was performed as described (Lu and Guidotti, 1996) with some modification. Three protein markers, bovine serum albumin (0.5 mg/ml), ovalbumin (0.5 mg/ml), and RNase A (0.9 mg/ml) were added to cross-linked or noncross-linked His-tagged fusion proteins (final concentration, 0.9 mg/ml). A 110 l aliquot of protein mixture was layered onto 4.6 ml of a linear 5%­20% (w/v) sucrose gradient. The samples were centrifuged for 7 hr (for N-PDZ12-H 6 and N-PDZ12[C3S/C5S]-H6 fusion proteins) or 16 hr (for N-H 6 fusion protein) at 48,000 rpm at 4 C in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor. Fractions of 300­400 l were collected from the bottom of the tubes and analyzed by SDS­PAGE and Coomassie blue staining or Western blotting with anti-myc antibody 9E10. Acknowledgments M.
