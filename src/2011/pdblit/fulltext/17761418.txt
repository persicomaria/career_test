Abstract The human b-secretase enzyme, BACE1, mediates a critical step in the production of Ab40 and Ab42 peptides which are responsible for the severe neuronal cell death and insoluble amyloid plaques of AlzheimerÕs disease (AD). Several lines of evidence suggest that potent BACE1 inhibitors represent an attractive Ab-lowering strategy for AD. We designed a simple homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay which utilizes the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair europium and allophycocyanin for measuring BACE1 enzymatic activity in a high-throughput manner. Robust FRET was observed when an 18amino-acid APP Swedish-synthetic peptide that was N-terminally labeled with europium cryptate and C-terminally biotinylated was incubated with streptavidin-coupled cross-linked allophycocyanin (SA-XL665). Purified BACE1 enzyme caused a time- and concentration-dependent linear change in FRET at low nanomolar enzyme concentrations. This assay was used to compare the autoprocessed ``mature'' BACE1 enzyme (sautoBACe1) and the soluble proBACE1 for activity and inhibition by selected peptidic BACE inhibitors. sautoBACE1 displayed only a modest increase in activity compared to sproBACE1 and this activity was uninhibited by the BACE1 prodomain peptide. Interestingly, the BACE1 prodomain peptide was able to partially inhibit sproBACE1 activity. IC50s for a P10-P4Õ statine BACE1 inhibitor, OM99-2, and OM-003 determined using the HTRF assay were in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The primary advantages of the HTRF-formatted BACE1 protease assay include appropriate reflection of native BACE1 activity, high sensitivity, low variability, and intrinsic quench correction afforded by ratiometric measurements made between EuK and SA-XL665 fluorophores.

AlzheimerÕs disease (AD),1 which is characterized by severe memory loss and neuronal cell death, is thought to be caused by the progressive brain accumulation of amyloidogenic Ab40;42 peptides into fibrillar aggregates and insoluble plaques [1]. Ab peptides are derived from the b-amyloid precursor protein (b-APP), which is processed in the cellÕs secretory pathway by three

distinct ordered enzymatic activities. The majority of bAPP is first cleaved by an activity termed a-secretase, which generates a soluble ectodomain termed APPsa and an 83-amino-acid membrane-bound fragment termed C83. C83 can then be cleaved by the membraneassociated c-secretase activity to give rise to fragments known as p3ð40;42Þ . A much smaller fraction of b-APP is cleaved by b-secretase activity, 16 residues proximal to the a-secretase site, to generate a soluble ectodomain termed APPsb and a 99-amino-acid membrane-bound C-terminal fragment termed C99. Like C83, C99 is also cleaved by c-secretase, which generates the pathogenic Ab1­40;42 peptides. The importance of b-secretase cleavage of b-APP as a critical step in the generation of AD is underscored by the observation that human mutations at the P1 and P2 b-secretase cleavage subsites (Swedish

mutation) lead to increased Ab production and early onset familial AD [2,3]. This finding identifies the bsecretase enzyme activity as a prime target for AD drug development. Recently, the molecular cloning of the cDNAs encoding BACE1 and BACE2, novel membrane-bound aspartyl proteases possessing b-secretase activity in vitro and in vivo, has been reported [4­7]. Gene-targeting studies in mice indicate that BACE1 is required for all detectable central nervous system bsecretase activity and Ab peptide production [8­10]. While BACE2 is capable of cleaving APP at the b-secretase cleavage site and other sites, the functional role of BACE2 is still unclear. Analysis of the BACE1 and BACE2 primary structure indicates that, like their bAPP substrate, BACE1 and BACE2 are integral membrane proteins [4­6], a unique feature among members of the aspartyl protease family. The aspartyl acid protease catalytic domain is encoded by the amino terminal 450 amino acids of BACE1. Indeed, deletion of the transmembrane domain by site-directed mutagenesis results in a soluble form of BACE1 that is secreted when expressed in mammalian or insect cells [11] and that maintains b-secretase activity. Successful screening of large compound libraries requires a sensitive and accurate method of measuring the activity of a protein that reasonably reflects the native process. Traditionally, protease activity can be easily measured by monitoring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) in quenched peptide substrates undergoing hydrolysis. Unfortunately, the traditional donor:acceptor pairs used in FRET assays (e.g., [12,13]) have significant drawbacks for use in highthroughput screening, including relatively small stokes shifts and excitation and emission optima at near-UV wavelengths that are shared by many small molecules found in compound collections. Caged lanthanides such as europium cryptate (EuK) represent a unique class of fluorescence donor with several characteristics desirable for use in high-throughput assays, namely a large stokes shift (excitation maximum at 337 nm and a primary emission maximum at 620 nm) and a long emission lifetime [14]. Importantly, the long emission lifetime allows for time-resolved measurements to be made, thus avoiding signal contamination by shorterlived signals contributed by other assay components, most notably the large number of diverse compounds screened during lead discovery. As an energy donor, EuK can be used in combination with the energy acceptor cross-linked allophycocyanin protein (XL665) in a format known as homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) [15]. XL665 is exceptionally well suited to use with EuK because of its intrinsic fluorescence properties; it allows simultaneous monitoring of 620 nm (EuK Em maximum) and 665 nm (XL665 Em maximum) signals and ratiometric quantitation of changes in FRET. In addition, EuK and XL665 dis-

 play a large Frster radius of 90 A, which makes them o useful for monitoring FRET over large distances. We took advantage of the robust qualities of HTRF to develop a simple high-throughput peptide-based protease assay for BACE1. In addition to the advantageous time-resolved property, the assay system described below requires only nanomolar quantities of the EuK-labeled peptide substrate and low nanomolar levels of the BACE1 enzyme, thus making this assay significantly more sensitive than a previously published FRET assay for BACE1 [16]. We also used the BACE HTRF assay to compare the catalytic and pharmacological properties of proBACE1 and autocatalytically processed mature BACE1.

Materials and methods Both the custom-synthesized europium cryptate-labeled APP Swedish (EuK-APPsw) peptide substrate, EuK-KTEEISEVNLDAEFRHDKC-biotin, and the cross-linked allophycocyanin protein coupled to streptavidin were obtained from CIS-Bio International (France). Peptides were synthesized by the following sources: unlabeled APPsw peptide substrate (KTEEISEVNLDAEF RHDK) and a renin inhibitor peptide (PHPFHFFVYK), American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale,CA); BACE1 prodomain peptide (TQHGIRLPLRSGLGGAPIGLRLPR), Synpep (Dublin, CA). Brij-35 detergent (protein grade), HIV inhibitor peptide (Ac-LV-phenylalaninal), and the renin inhibitor (H-PHPFHL(wCH2NH)VIHK-OH) were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 1,4Piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (Pipes) and Tris­HCl were purchased from Fisher Chemicals (Fair Lawn, NJ). Glycerol (molecular biology grade) was purchased form Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). Potassium fluoride (KF), D -biotin, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Aurora, OH). The BACE inhibitor peptide, KTEEISEVN (statine)VAEF-OH, was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The OM99-2 inhibitory peptide (H-EVNL (wHet)AAEF-OH) [17,18] and the renin inhibitor peptide (Z-RRPFH(statine)IHK(Boc)-OMe) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance,CA).

Cloning, protein expression, and purification The full-length human BACE1 cDNA in pCDNA4/ mycHisA was obtained from the University of Toronto.

from the full-length BACE1 cDNA by PCR using the advantage-GC cDNA PCR Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A HindIII/PmeI fragment from pCDNA4-sBACE1myc/His was blunt-ended using Klenow and subcloned into the StuI site of pFASTBACI(A) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A sBACE1mycHis recombinant bacmid was generated by transposition in DH10Bac cells (Gibco/BRL). Subsequently, the sBACE1mycHis bacmid construct was transfected into sf9 cells using CellFectin (Invitrogen) to generate recombinant baculovirus. sf9 cells were grown in SF 900-II medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 3% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0:5Â penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). Five milliliters of high-titer plaque-purified sBACEmyc/His virus was used to infect 1 L of logarithmically growing sf9 cells for 72 h. Intact cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 3000g for 15 min. The supernatant, containing secreted sBACE1, was collected and diluted 50% v/v with 100 mM Hepes, pH 8.0. The diluted medium was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column. The Q-Sepharose column was washed with Buffer A (20 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl). Proteins were eluted from the Q-Sepharose column with Buffer B (20 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl). The protein peaks from the Q-Sepharose column were pooled and loaded onto a Ni­NTA agarose column. The Ni­NTA column was then washed with Buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl). Bound proteins were then eluted with Buffer D (Buffer C + 250 mM imidazole). Peak protein fractions as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Torrence, CA) were concentrated using a Centricon 30 concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA). sBACE1 purity was estimated to be $90% as assessed by SDS­PAGE and Commassie blue staining. N-terminal sequencing indicated that greater than 90% of the purified sBACE1 contained the prodomain; hereafter soluble BACE1 containing the prodomain is referred to as sproBACE1. Generation of autoprocessed soluble BACE1 Purified sproBACE1 containing a C-terminal TEV cleavage site, introduced by oligo-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using the Quickchange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), for removal of the myc/His tag was concentrated to approximately 18 mg/ml in 20 mM Hepes, pH 8.0. The concentrated proenzyme preparation was acidified to pH 4.0 using NaOAc buffer and incubated at 4 °C for up to 24 h. The extent of N-terminal autocleavage of sBACE1 was determined by measurement of the protein mass using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. Masses were consistent with 56% of the molecules being cleaved at LPRE. . ., 31% cleavage at ETDEEP. . . (native mature BACE1 N-terminal sequence), and 12% cleavage at LRLPRE. . .. Less than 1 pmol of uncleaved material

was detected. Autoprocessed soluble BACE1 is hereafter referred to as sautoBACE1. Peptide hydrolysis assay Details for each experiment are given in the figure legends. Briefly, measurement of BACE1-mediated peptide hydrolysis was carried out for 3 h at 30 °C in 25ll volumes under the following conditions unless otherwise specified in the figure legends: 25 nM EuKAPPsw substrate, 5 lM unlabeled APPsw peptide, 7 nM sproBACE1, 20 mM Pipes, pH 5.0, 0.1% BRIJ-35, 10% glycerol. Reactions were initiated by addition of substrate in a 5-ll volume. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2Â stop buffer containing 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M KF, 0.001% Brij-35, 20 lg/ml streptavidin-labeled XL665 (SA-XL665) (0.5 lg/well). Plates were shaken briefly and spun at 1200g for 10 s to pellet all liquid to the bottom of the plate before the incubation. In experiments where inhibitor peptides were evaluated, enzyme and inhibitors were preincubated for 30 min at 30 °C prior to substrate addition. HTRF measurements were made on a Packard Discovery HTRF plate-reader using 337-nm laser light to excite the sample followed by a 50-ls delay and simultaneous measurements of both 620- and 665-nm emissions for 400 ls. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, 620-nm energy emitted from the EuK moiety can be transferred via nonradiative energy transfer (FRET) to the proximal XL665 protein in the intact peptide or emitted as light after peptide cleavage. After absorbing the 620-nm energy, the XL665 protein emits light at 665 nm. The 620- and 665-nm emissions were measured either simultaneously or sequentially, depending on the experiment. Individual 620- and 665-nm emissions or a ratio of the 665/620 nm Â 104 was used for subsequent calculations.

Fig. 1. Sequence of the EuK-labeled BACE1 substrate (EuK-APPsw). The peptide contains the KM ! NL Swedish APP mutation (underlined) which enhances b-secretase-mediated cleavage of the holo-APP protein. The EuK fluorophore is excited by 340-nm light followed by a 50-ls delay; 620- and 665-nm emissions are then simultaneously collected for 400 ls. When the peptide is intact, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs between the EuK and the streptavidinXL665 (SA-XL665) moieties, resulting in quenched 620-nm RFU and increased 665-nm RFU and thus high 665/620 ratios. FRET is disrupted by cleavage at the scissile bond by BACE1.

Results and discussion An 18-amino-acid peptide containing the Swedish mutant APP sequence (EuK-APPsw) was synthesized and covalently modified with Eu3þ cryptate and biotin at its amino terminus and C terminus, respectively (Fig. 1). The optimal EuK-APPsw concentration was determined to be 25 nM since this afforded significant 620-nm fluorescent units and minimal (<1000 counts) crossover to the 665-nm channel (data not shown). Potassium fluoride, which functions to enhance the nonradiative energy emission from the EuK-APPsw peptide via FÀ ionsÕ ability to exclude water from the caged Eu3þ cryptate [24], was optimal at 0.25 M KF (Fig. 2A). The data shown in Fig. 2B demonstrate the overall behavior of this system. Wells containing only SA-XL665 or EuKAPPsw display negligible 665-nm emissions when excited by 337-nm light. Wells containing only EuK-APPsw emit approximately 40,000 relative fluorescence units at 620 nm. The combination of EuK-APPsw and SAXL665 results in robust energy transfer between EuK

(B) Evaluation of FRET efficiency at 25 nM EuK-APPsw substrate and 0.5 lg/well SA-XL665. All of the observed increase in 665-nm RFU is dependent on the EuK-APPsw peptide. XL-665 quenches the 620-nm RFU by approximately 75%. The SA-XL665 quenching can almost be completely reversed by addition of 50 lM D -biotin, indicating that there is little nonspecific FRET occurring. Addition of sproBACE1 enzyme for 3 h disrupts FRET as manifested by an increase in 620-nm RFU and a concomitant decrease in 665-nm RFU.

and XL665 as evidenced by a 500-fold increase in the 665-nm signal (Fig. 2B). There is a concomitant 75% quenching of the 620-nm signal (Fig. 2B). The increased 665-nm signal is nearly completely reversed by the addition of 50 lM D -biotin to the reaction, indicating that there is little nonspecific FRET occurring in solution. The incubation of sproBACE1 enzyme at 7 nM for 3 h with the EuK-APPsw peptide resulted in a significant drop in 665-nm emission and concomitant increase in 620-nm emission, which is what would be predicted as the sproBACE1 cleaves the peptide substrate. The change in FRET is typically manifested as an approximate 20,000­25,000 unit decrease in the calculated 665/ 620 (Â104 ) ratio. Unfortunately, sproBACE1-mediated peptide hydrolysis does not occur in the presence of KF and the SA-XL665 protein (data not shown). Thus, continuous kinetic measurements could not be made. The inhibition of BACE1 activity by SA-XL665 is most likely due to steric hindrance by the relatively large SA-XL665. Sufficiently high concentrations of EuK-APPsw peptide could not be tested to determine Km values due to crossover of the 620-nm signal to the 665-nm channel at labeled substrate concentrations greater than 50 nM. All reactions included 5 lM unlabeled APPsw peptide since reported Km values for APPsw peptides of similar length are in the low micromolar range. Despite the likely micromolar Km for the EuK-APPsw peptide, hydrolysis of 25 nM EuK-APPsw could be readily detected at nanomolar BACE1 concentrations. sproBACE1-mediated hydrolysis of the EuK-APPsw is concentration dependent (Fig. 3A). The ratiometric aspect of the assay adequately controls for variations in the amount of EuK-APPsw peptide or SA-XL665 added to each well; hence the standard error for the 665/620 ratio at each sproBACAE1 concentration is very small and much lower than those for the individual 620- and 665-nm measurements. SproBACE1 activity is linear over 210 min (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, both the sproBACE1 and the sautoBACE1 forms of the BACE1 enzyme are tolerant to high concentrations of DMSO, a common solvent used in compound screening. BACE1 activity was readily detected in the presence of 20% DMSO (data not shown). Ninety percent of BACE1 secreted from sf9 cells contains the 45-amino-acid amino-terminal prodomain (see Materials and methods). Unlike other aspartic proteases such as cathepsin D, pepsin, and renin, sproBACE1 exhibits significant enzymatic activity toward it cognate substrate, suggesting that BACE1 does not exist as a zymogen. A specific required function for the prodomain in the maturation and folding of the BACE1 protein has been proposed [19]. SproBACE1 and a soluble BACE1 protein that was autoprocessed to remove the prodomain sequence (sautoBACE1) were compared for their ability to hydrolyze the EuK-APPsw peptide substrate at varying

enzyme concentrations. Soluble proBACE1 and sautoBACE1 caused similar changes in the FRET ratio at low concentrations of enzyme. However, this observation was reversed at higher enzyme concentrations (Fig. 4A), where sautoBACE1 promoted a significantly greater drop in the ratio after 3 h of incubation. A time course comparing rate of change in the 665/620 ratio for sproBACE1 or sautoBACE1 at 5 lM total substrate indicates that removal of the prodomain caused an apparent increase in the rate of peptide hydrolysis (Fig. 4B). To determine whether the prodomain could block enzyme activity when added exogenously to the assay, we generated a synthetic peptide comprising the predicted BACE1 prodomain and evaluated its ability to inhibit sproBACE1 and sautoBACE1 activity (Fig. 4C). Although the BACE1 prodomain peptide appears to inhibit sproBACE1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner the inhibition is incomplete even up to 100 lM concentration. Interestingly, sautoBACE1 activity was unaffected by the prodomain peptide (Fig. 4C). The reason for the lack of inhibition of sautoBACE1 is unknown but could reflect the inability of the sautoBACE1 active site to achieve a conformation compatible with prodomain binding after the prodomain has been cleaved from the amino terminus.

A selected number of known aspartyl acid protease inhibitor peptides were evaluated for inhibition of sproBACE1 and sautoBACE1 activity in our assay. As previously reported, the classic aspartic protease inhibitor, pepstatin A, had no effect on BACE1 activity at concentrations up to 50 lM (Table 1) [4­6]. In addition, peptide inhibitors of renin displayed modest inhibition of sproBACE1 (data not shown). Since the identification of BACE1, examples of potent statine and homostatine

transition-state mimetic peptide inhibitors have been identified [4,17]. These inhibitors are all derived from the APP substrate sequence and incorporate nonhydrolyzable statine or homostatine cores typically used to develop inhibitors for aspartyl proteases such as pepsin and renin. The first such inhibitor was described by Sinha et al. [4] (Table 1). Significantly shorter and more potent peptide inhibitors based on homostatine cores, termed OM99-2 and OM003, were later described by Ghosh et al [17,18,20]. All three of these substrate-derived inhibitors of BACE1 were evaluated in the HTRFbased peptide hydrolysis assay using both sproBACE1 and sautoBACE1 enzymes. The relative rank order of potency and the absolute IC50 values for potency were found to be identical at both forms of the enzyme for all three inhibitors (Table 1, and Fig. 5). Also, the calculated IC50s are in good agreement with those reported in the literature [4,11,16,20­22].

Reactions were run in the presence of 25 nM EuK-APPsw and 5 lM unlabeled APPsw peptide substrates and 6 nM enzyme in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of peptidic inhibitors for 3 h at 30 °C, pH 5.0. The ratio values measured at each concentration were normalized to the maximum ratio (no enzyme) and minimum ratio (3 h time point) to give percentage inhibition values. Data were analyzed using Prism 3.0 and curves were fit to the percentage inhibition data using nonlinear regression analysis with a single-site competition model or sigmoidal dose response with a variable slope model. IC50s are included in Table 1 and are in good agreement with those reported in the literature using kinetic assays.

FRET assays are ideally suited for monitoring protease activity since substrates which place the donor and acceptor molecules at or within their Forster radii or optimal distances for FRET to occur can usually be designed. Experiments designed to identify a minimum APP peptide substrate for human BACE1 enzyme suggest that truncation beyond P10-P4Õ drastically reduces enzyme recognition of the peptide [4]. Hence, a large peptide substrate is needed for measurement of BACE1 activity, and donor/acceptor pairs with large Forster radii are required. EuK and the SA-XL665 molecules display the greatest Forster distances of any biologically used FRET pair (R0 ¼ 90 A) [23,24], which makes them ideally suited for the study of larger peptide substrates such as the 18-residue APPsw peptide described here. The 75% efficiency of FRET (calculated as the fluorescence intensity at 620 nm in the presence of SA-XL665 divided by the fluorescence intensity at 620 nm in the absence of SA-XL665) for the 18-residue EuK-APPsw peptide reflects the large Forster radius for EuK. Other advantages of the HTRF-formatted BACE1 protease assay described include its high sensitivity, microsecond time resolution, and low variability due to the intrinsic quench correction afforded by ratiometric measurements between EuK and SA-XL665 fluorophores. BACE1mediated hydrolysis of the EuK-APPsw peptide is readily detected using only 25 nM-labeled substrate and low nanomolar concentrations of pro enzyme or mature enzyme in 384-well plates. Hence, reagent usage is minimal, an important consideration when the assay will be used to screen millions of compounds. When practically screening large numbers of compounds for inhibitors using a nontime-resolved fluorescence assay, the contaminating intrinsic short-lived fluorescent properties of prospective inhibitors can dramatically reduce the robustness of large scale screens. However, the HTRF format allows for a 50-ls delay before the 620- and 665nm signals are measured, thus virtually eliminating any contaminating signals. Indeed, inclusion of low micromolar amounts of fluorescein in the assay contributes roughly 2 Â 104 RFUs at 620 nm without the delay present and this signal is completely eliminated by the 50ls delay (data not shown). The 50-ls delay is made possible by the slow rate of decay for the EuK and XL665 emissions. Although the delay is not necessary for monitoring BACE activity, in the absence of diverse small molecules, the delay is critical to the collection of interpretable data from a screen of thousands of small molecule mixtures. The reproducibility of the assay is robust with CV values consistently observed between 1 and 5%. Although we consistently observed the highest sensitivity for the assay when using the laser-excitationbased Packard Discovery HTRF reader, xenon-flashlamp-based HTRF-compatible readers performed adequately with low CVs. Importantly, the EuK-APPsw peptide substrate also serves as a substrate for the puri-

fied human soluble proBACE2 enzyme, a close homolog of BACE1, which is expressed primarily in peripheral tissues. Therefore, this assay can also be used to screen for inhibitors of BACE2. Indeed, the peptide inhibitors listed in Table 1 showed potencies at sproBACE2 (data not shown) identical to those observed at sproBACE1. Although the EuK-APPsw peptide substrate is far removed from the native APP protein, our experience indicates that molecules capable of inhibiting EuK-APPsw peptide hydrolysis display similar potencies at the native APP substrate. The primary limitation of the BACE HTRF assay is that it cannot be used in a continuous format for kinetic measurements, so it is not an appropriate method for defining the mechanism of inhibition. However, the observation that the IC50s for several known peptide inhibitors of BACE1 were not significantly different from published values, determined via low-throughput kinetic assays, and did not vary considerably when the incubation period was varied between 30 min and 3 h suggests that this assay format is ideally suited for large scale screening and rapid comparison of inhibitor potencies.
