The Structure of an FF Domain from Human HYPA/FBP11
Mark Allen, Assaf Friedler, Oliver Schon and Mark Bycroft*
MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, Hills Road Cambridge CB2 2QH, UK The FF domain is a 60 amino acid residue phosphopeptide-binding module found in a variety of eukaryotic proteins including the transcription elongation factor CA150, the splicing factor Prp40 and p190RHOGAP. We have determined the structure of an FF domain from HYPA/FBP11. The domain is composed of three a helices arranged in an orthogonal bundle with a 310 helix in the loop between the second and third a helices. The structure differs from those of other phosphopeptide-binding domains and represents a novel phosphopeptide-binding fold.

Phosphorylation is used as a control signal in many important biological processes. The activity of eukayrotic RNA polymerase II (RNAP II), for example, is regulated by phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of its largest subunit.1 Unphosphorylated CTD is required for transcription initiation. Once transcription has commenced, a variety of kinases phosphorylate the CTD to produce an elongation-competent enzyme. The CTD consists of 17­ 52 tandem heptad repeats with the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. Phosphorylation occurs predominantly at serine 2 and serine 5. The phosphorylated repeats recruit a variety of proteins that regulate mRNA synthesis and processing. The yeast protein Prp40 and the human protein CA150 have both been shown to bind to phosphorylated CTD.2,3 These proteins bind also to the splicing factor BBP/SF1, and provide a link between RNA processing and transcription. Prp40 and CA150 both contain a series of WW domains followed by an array of FF domains. In addition to CA150, the human genome codes for two more WW and FF domain-containing proteins; HYPA/FBP11 and HYPC. HYPA/FBP11, HYPC and CA150 have all been shown to interact with huntingtin, the protein encoded by the gene mutated in Huntington's disease,4,5 and it has been proposed that the disruption of these

interactions may contribute to the pathology of the disease.6 The interaction between CA150 and phosphorylated RNAP II CTD is mediated by the FF domains of this protein.7 As well as being components of the CA150/Prp40 family of proteins, FF domains are found singly or in multiple copies in a number of other proteins.8 In order to try and learn more about this module, we have determined the structure of an FF domain from human HYPA/FBP11.

Structure description
The structure of a 71 amino acid residue fragment of human HYPA/FBP11 encompassing the first FF domain was determined using standard NMR methods (Figure 1, Table 1). The sequences of the first FF domain of human and mouse HYPA/FBP11 are identical. Residues are numbered according to the mouse sequence, as this protein has been characterised in more detail. The FF domain structure is composed of three a helices arranged in an orthogonal bundle with a 310 helix in the loop between the second and third a helices (Figure 1(a)). The N and C termini of the domain are at opposite ends of the structure, a feature found often in modules that form tandem arrays. A few FF domain sequences have insertions and deletions compared to the sequence of the HYPA/ FBP11 domain. These are restricted to the loop between helices 1 and 2 and the loop between the 310 helix and the final a helix (Figure 2(b)). The two highly conserved phenylalanine residues, from which the domain takes its name, are in the

middle of the first and third a helices, and form part of the hydrophobic core of the protein (Figure 2(a)). The first of these residues is part of a conserved FXXLL sequence. It has been noted that this is a potential nuclear receptor (NR) box8 a sequence motif present in a number of transcription co-activators that is involved in ligand-dependent binding to nuclear receptors.9 In the FF domain structure, the two leucine residues of this motif are at the C terminus of the first a helix and form part of the hydrophobic core (Figure 2(a)). It is unlikely that the structure could rearrange such that these residues became available for an interaction with a ligand and the sequence similarity is probably not functionally significant. The only other residue that is conserved in more than 80% of FF domains is a tryptophan residue corresponding to Trp411 in this structure. This residue is at the start of the second a helix and packs into the hydrophobic core of the domain (Figure 2(a)). A number of positions are occupied by hydrophobic or aromatic amino acid residues in the majority of FF domains. Most of these are in the a helices and are involved in helix/helix packing. The exceptions are Tyr424 and Leu427, which are in the 310 helix and anchor this element of secondary structure into the main hydrophobic core. The strong preference for aromatic or hydrophobic amino acid residues at these positions suggests that the 310 helix is a feature of most FF domains. Residues on the surface of the domain are less well conserved. The most conserved solvent-exposed residues are Asp421 and Arg423. They are conserved in approximately 50% of FF domain sequences and, where present, the residue between

them is usually proline. These residues are situated in the turn between the second a helix and the 310 helix. Analysis of the ensemble of structures revealed the potential formation of a salt-bridge between these residues and it appears that they may be conserved for stability reasons rather than for function. Residues 393 and 433 are conserved as lysine or arginine in over 50% of FF domains. They are situated at the start of a-helix 1 and in the middle of the final a helix (Figure 3(b)). They are close together in space and could be functionally important.

Structural similarities
The structures of several other phosphoserine/ threonine domains have been determined.10 The FF domain structure differs significantly from these and represents a novel phosphopeptidebinding fold. When the FF domain structure was compared to other known protein structures using the program DALI,11 the highest score (Z ¼ 5) was to the C-terminal region (residues 304 ­ 368) of the a isoform of human protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2C (Figure 1(c)).12 The region of similarity is found only in a sub-family of mammalian phosphatases and forms a distinct unit that folds independently of the catalytic domain. Comparison of protein structures can potentially reveal distant evolutionary relationships. For small, allhelical modules such as the FF domain, however, structural similarities may be only the result of the constraints imposed by the rules governing the packing of helices and must be viewed with

The coding sequence for residues 357­ 425 of SPTREMBL O75400 corresponding to the FF domain was amplified by PCR from IMAGE cDNA clone 731611 (obtained from the MRC HGMP Resource Centre) by standard methods and cloned into a pRSET-derived pHisGro vector. This was used to over-express a soluble histidine-tagged GroEL apical domain/FF domain fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was purified under native conditions using NTA agarose (Qiagen). After cleavage with thrombin, the FF domain was purified using ion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration. The samples for NMR spectroscopy typically contained 2.5 mM human FF domain in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O containing 50 mM KCl, 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0) at 298 K. The NMR spectra were assigned using standard NMR methods.18,19 The assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank under accession numbers PDB 1H40 BMRDB 5537. A set of distance constraints were derived from a series of NOESY spectra recorded in H2O and 2H2O with mixing times of 150 ms. The NOESY spectrum was integrated according to the cross-peak strengths and calibrated by comparison with NOE connectivities obtained for standard inter-residue distances within an a helix. After calibration, the NOE constraints were classified into the following categories: strong, medium, weak and very weak, corresponding to inter-proton distance constraints of ° ° ° ° 1.8­ 2.8 A, 1.8 ­ 3.5 A, 1.8 ­ 4.75 A, and 2.5 ­ 6.0 A, respectively. Hydrogen bond constraints were included for a number of backbone NH groups whose signals were observed in a 2D 1H­ 15N-HSQC recorded in 99.996% 2H2O at 298 K (pH 5.0). For hydrogen bond partners, two distance constraints were used where the distance (D)H­O(A) corresponded to ° ° 1.5­ 2.5 A and (D)N ­ O(A) to 2.5 ­ 3.5 A. Torsional angle constraints were obtained from an analysis of C0 , N, Ca Ha and Cb chemical shifts using the program TALOS.20 The three-dimensional structure of the FF domain was calculated ¨ using a dynamic simulated annealing protocol based upon the work of Nilges et al.21 in the program XPLOR (Brunger, A. T. (1992). X-PLOR Version 3.1: a system for cystallography and NMR, Yale University, New Haven, CT). The coordinates have been deposited in the protein structure database, entry.

caution. The fact that the region of the phosphatase similar to the FF domain forms a discrete domain and is found in a protein of related function is suggestive of a potential homology. The role of the phosphatase C-terminal domain is unknown, however, and it is not clear if the structural similarity to the FF domain reflects an evolutionary or functional relationship.

Phosphopeptide binding
The FF domains of CA150 have been shown to bind to phosphorylated RNAPII CTD.7 To determine if the HYPA/FBP11 FF domain could interact with the RNAP II CTD, we used isothermal titration calorimetry to study the binding of the domain to a 16 residue peptide corresponding to two CTD repeats phosphorylated on serine 2 and serine 5 of the consensus sequence. An interaction between the protein and the peptide was detected with a binding constant of approximately 50 mM. No binding could be detected with a nonphosphoylated peptide. We next tried to localise the binding site by monitoring the changes in chemical shifts produced in the 2D 1H ­ 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the domain when an excess of the peptide was added. The biggest changes in chemical shift were for residues at the N terminus of the first a helix and the N terminus of the third a helix (Figure

3(a)). The changes in chemical shift form an arc on the protein surface centred on a shallow cleft between the N termini of a helices 1 and 4. This region of the protein contains a cluster of positively charged amino acid residues (Figure 3(b)) including the two conserved lysine residues and is probably the peptide-binding site. The CTD repeat contains two SPXX motifs, SPTS and SPSY, which have the potential to form b turns and the pattern of chemical shifts changes seems consistent with the peptide binding in a turn-like conformation. Unfortunately, transfer nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) experiments could not be used to provide information about the bound state conformation, due to the low molecular mass of the FF domain ­ peptide complex.

Conclusions
The CTD of RNAP II plays a central role in coordinating transcription and RNA processing.13 The FF domain is one of several protein modules that have been found to bind to phosphorylated RNAP II CTD. The best-characterised interaction is that between the WW domain of Pin1 and RNAP II CTD.14 Pin1 binds to a CTD-derived phoshopeptide about an order of magnitude tighter than the HYPA FF domain. Pin1 has only a single CTD-binding site, whilst HYPA/FBP11 and related proteins have a series of FF domains that

Proteins included are the WW/FF domain-containing proteins that have been shown to bind to RNAP II CTD via their FF domains (mouse HYPA/FBP11(Q9R1C7), Saccharomyces cerevisiae PRP40 (PR40_YEAST), human CA150 (O14776)), human RHOGAP 190-A (Q9NRY4) and human RHOGAP 190-B (Q13017).

could potentially bind to several CTD repeats. The increased avidity produced by the multiple binding sites would lead to a tighter interaction and it is possible that HYPA/FBP11-like proteins bind preferentially to hyper-phosphorylated CTD. Are FF domains specialised phosphopeptidebinding modules that just recognise phosphorylated RNAPII CTD or are they capable of binding to other phoshopeptide motifs? FF domaincontaining proteins fall into three categories. Proteins containing WW and FF domains have been found in all eukaryotic genomes sequenced so far. The members of this family that have been characterised to date have all been found to have a role in RNA metabolism. The FF domains of three of these proteins CA150, PRP40 and HYPA/ FBP11 have been shown to bind phosphorylated

RNAPII CTD, suggesting that the FF domains of the WW/FF protein family all recognise this motif. FF domains are present in a number of hypothetical proteins identified by various genome sequencing projects for which no biochemical data are available. Interestingly, one of these, the Drosophila protein CG1078, contains, in addition to a single FF domain, a region similar in sequence to FIP1, a component of yeast pre-mRNA polyadenylation factor.15 RNAP II CTD has been shown to be required for pre-mRNA polyadenylation,16 suggesting that the FF domain of CG1078 could be involved in RNAP II CTD binding. The mammalian p190RhoGAP family of proteins contain FF domains. These proteins modulate the activity of the small GTPase Rho, and have been implicated in the regulation of

The residues indicated are those whose backbone amide 1H shift changes by more than ^ 0.05 ppm or whose backbone amide 15N chemical shift changes by more than ^0.20 ppm when a threefold excess of the CTD peptide was added to a 0.5 mM solution of the domain in 25 mM Mes (pH 6.5). The phosphopeptide was synthesized using a pioneer peptide synthesizer (Perseptive biosystems). Standard Fmoc chemistry was used, with double coupling of every amino acid. Phosphoserine residues were incorporated using the protected derivative Fmoc-Ser (PO(Obzl)OH)-OH (NOVAbiochem). The peptide was cleaved from the resin using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/water/triisopropylsilane (95:2.5:2.5, by vol.) for four hours at room temperature. Purification of the peptide was performed on a Waters 600 HPLC using a preparative C8 column (Vydac). The peptide was characterized by analytical HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The dissociation constant for the peptide FF domain interaction was determined using an OMEGA isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, USA). Peptide was titrated into a solution of the FF domain in 25 mM Mes (pH 6.5) at 298 K. (b) The electrostatic potential at the molecular surface of the FF domain.

actin rearrangement in response to a variety of extracellular signals.17 The FF domains of these proteins are more divergent in sequence and contain distinct patterns of conserved residues (Figure 2(b)). The second of the conserved lysine/arginine residues is generally not present, and many have a histidine residue at end of the last helix. p190RhoGAP proteins have not been reported to bind to the CTD of RNAP II. They are, however, known to be involved in signal transduction pathways that are controlled by phosphorylation, and it is likely that FF domains of these proteins bind to a different phosphopeptide motif. We clearly have a lot more to learn about the FF domain. The structure described here will provide a structural basis for experiments aimed at obtaining a more detailed understanding of the functions of this module and proteins that contain it.
