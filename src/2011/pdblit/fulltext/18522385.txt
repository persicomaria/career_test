Comparison of this structure with those of dexamethasone and fluticasone propionate shows the 17R furoate ester to occupy more fully the lipophilic 17R pocket on the receptor, which may account for the enhanced glucocorticoid receptor binding of FF.

Fluticasone furoate (FF,a GW685698X) is a novel topical glucocorticoid recently introduced for the intranasal treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.1 FF is a potent lipophilic glucocorticoid agonist displaying once-daily efficacy on both nasal and ocular symptoms of allergic rhinitis.2 FF combines the fluticasone template, which confers efficient systemic inactivation through the 17 -fluoromethylthioester moiety, with a metabolically stable 17R furoate ester. The efficient hepatic inactivation of FF results in negligible systemic exposure (<1%) after intranasal dosing, and levels of free drug are further minimized by the very high plasma protein binding (>99%) of FF.3,4 The furoate ester of FF replaces the simpler propionate ester of the earlier fluticasone propionate (FP). This 17R elaboration has been shown to confer enhanced respiratory tissue retention and receptor binding for FF compared to FP, properties believed to contribute to its attractive clinical profile.4,5 Thus, FF displays a rapid association with and slow dissociation from the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resulting in the highest reported receptor binding affinity (2989 ( 135 with reference to dexamethasone 100, fluticasone propionate 1775 ( 130).5 The structure of the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was first determined through X-ray

crystallography in 2002 as a complex with dexamethasone (Dex).6 Prior to that time we had utilized the structure for the closely homologous progesterone receptor (PR), with progesterone bound, to provide insights into interactions between steroidal ligands and GR.7 It was clear from the PR structure that a small lipophilic pocket existed close to the 17R steroidal position and that by analogy a similar, but larger, pocket must exist in GR to accommodate the 17R propionate group of fluticasone propionate (FP). Early studies with dermatological glucocorticoids established that topical activity could be enhanced by the introduction of lipophilic 17R ester functionality such as simple alkyl and benzoate esters.8 A small number of heteroaryl esters were investigated in the 1980s9 leading to the identification of mometasone furoate10 and, more recently, relatively simple 17R carbonate esters have also been explored leading to the discovery of loteprednol etabonate.11 However, when we started this work, no detailed investigation of the effects of 17R esterification had been described12 and we therefore undertook a program of work to extensively investigate 17R elaboration on the fluticasone template.13 This work led to the identification of the 2-furoate ester of fluticasone (fluticasone furoate, FF) displaying very interesting properties including the highest glucocorticoid receptor affinity so far reported.4,5 Subsequent to this original modeling work, crystal structures for GR complexed with Dex, FP, and FF were obtained allowing comparison of the ligand-receptor interactions and a qualitative and semiquantitative rationalization of the differences seen in binding affinity. The crystal structures for complexes with Dex6,14 and FP15 have been published elsewhere, but here the crystal structure for the FF complex is published for the first time. Crystal structures for GR complexes are rare. However, the structure for GR complexed with the antagonist RU486 has been determined14 and very recently the structure was reported for GR complexed with the agonist deacylcortivazol.16 Fluticasone furoate was readily prepared13a from the known hydroxy thioacid 1 using standard methodology.17 Reaction of 1 with excess 2-furoyl chloride (2.6 equiv) followed by treatment of the intermediate bis-acylated 17 mixed anhydride with diethylamine afforded the thioacid 17R furoate 2. Alkylation of 2 with bromofluoromethane then gave fluticasone furoate as a white crystalline solid (Scheme 1). The human glucocorticoid receptor (residues 521-777 F602Y, C638G) was expressed as a 6xHisGST fusion protein in E. coli supplemented with FF. Purification of the GR ligand binding

domain (LBD) was accomplished by affinity chromatography and thrombin cleavage followed by ion exchange chromatography. Crystals of the GR protein (Figure 1) complexed with a 12-residue TIF2 coactivator peptide were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 22 °C using 100 mM BisTrisPropane, pH 7.0, and 2.2 M sodium chloride as the precipitant. Crystals were flash frozen in paraffin oil prior to data collection and belong to the space group P61 with 2 mol/ asu. The data were collected at beamline 17ID at the Advance Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratories, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of GR complexed with dexamethasone as a starting model. The structure was refined with CNX18 and Refmac19 to an Rfactor of 21% at 2.85 Å resolution.20 The overall structure of the GR LBD has been previously described.6,14,21,22 In all three structures, GR/FF/TIF2, GR/FP/ TIF2, and GR/Dex/TIF2, the GR LBD binds one steroid molecule and one coactivator peptide. The GR/FF structure was

solved using a mutant variant of the GR LBD different from that used for the Dex and FP complexes, F602Y and C638G, which were introduced to improve expression and purification. These mutations are distant from the ligand binding cavity and do not perturb the overall protein structure. There are no large conformational changes of helices or loops between the FF, FP, and Dex structures, consistent with the fact that all three agonist ligands bind with high affinity. However, in both the FF and FP structures, the 17R pocket is expanded relative to the pocket observed in the Dex structure because of small movements in helices 3, 6, 7, and 10 and the loop preceding the AF2 helix as well as changes in the conformation of the side chains of Met560, Gln642, and Tyr735. The overall protein conformation and size of the 17R pocket were essentially identical in the FF and FP structures. Interactions between the protein and ligands (Dex, FP, and FF) are shown in Figures 2­4. It can be seen that for Dex, FP, and FF the 3-keto group forms hydrogen bonds to Gln570 and Arg611 while the 11 hydroxyl forms hydrogen bonds to Asn564. Asn564 also forms a hydrogen bond to the Dex 21hydroxyl group, and a similar interaction is seen with the 17 fluoromethylthio fluorine of FP and FF, which can be considered to make a favorable electrostatic interaction with Asn564.

The 17R hydroxyl group of Dex is seen to hydrogen-bond to Gln642, an interaction that is not possible with FP and FF, which replace this hydroxyl with a 17R ester function. However, the absence of the hydrogen bond is more than compensated for by the introduction of favorable van der Waals (VDW) interactions within the 17R pocket which FF appears to fill fully but which FP fills only partially. Indeed, for the FP complex only weak density is observed for this substituent and two different conformations were observed in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit indicating considerable freedom of movement15 (only one molecule is shown in Figure 3). For FF the key interacting residues in the 17R pocket were seen to be Met560, Leu563, Met639, Gln642, Met643, Met646, Tyr735, Cys736, Thr739, and Ile747. The relative differences in binding affinity between Dex, FP, and FF are 1:18:29.5 There are multiple differences between Dex and FP/FF, most notably the loss of two clear hydrogen bonds seen for Dex which are replaced by a favorable electrostatic interaction between the fluorine atom of the fluoromethylthio group and by favorable VDW/hydrophobic interactions in the 17R pocket. H-bonding can clearly be critical for specificity at a target, but the effect of the loss of a hydrogen bond on binding affinity can be highly variable. It is very much dependent on the nature and the quality of the hydrogen bonding interactions that are being replaced; i.e., the ligand will have opportunities to form excellent H-bonds with solvent and it is likely that the protein will likewise have solvent interactions that are displaced on ligand binding. In this case it would appear that the loss of hydrogen bonds can be more than compensated for by increased VDW/hydrophobic interactions through an increase in buried surface area. FP and FF are an interesting comparison because they differ only in the 17R ester moiety. The increase in binding affinity for FF over FP is just over 60%. FF can be seen to fill the lipophilic 17R pocket more effectively than FP (see Figures 3­5). The difference in the 17R pocket lipophilic contact surface area, between FP and FF, was estimated23 at 14 Å2. This increase in buried hydrophobic surface would certainly increase the binding affinity. Quantifying such an effect is not straightforward. However, the free energy gain may be calculated using the figures for lipophilic contact proposed by Bohm:24 -0.17 kJ mol-1 Å2. Applying this figure suggests a FP to FF free energy gain of -2.4 kJ mol-1, which would be expected to increase affinity by 2.5-fold, a result of similar order to that observed. In summary, the crystallographically determined structure of the GR/FF complex is published here for the first time. Fluticasone furoate is the highest affinity ligand so far identified for GR, and structural comparisons at the molecular level have highlighted the more complete filling of the lipophilic 17R pocket by the furoate moiety as the likely source of this enhanced receptor affinity. The structure of GR/FF has been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Databank (PDB code 3CLD) and should be of great utility to researchers in the field. References
