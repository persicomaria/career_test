ABS T R AC T The interaction between integrin macrophage differentiation antigen associated with complement three receptor function (Mac-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is controlled tightly by the ligand-binding activity of Mac-1, is central to the regulation of neutrophil adhesion in host defense. Several "inside­out" signals and extracellular metal ions or antibodies have been found to activate Mac-1, resulting in an increased adhesiveness of Mac-1 to its ligands. However, the molecular basis for Mac-1 activation is not well understood yet. In this work, we have carried out a single-molecule study of Mac-1/ICAM-1 interaction force in living cells by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results showed that the binding probability and adhesion force of Mac-1 with ICAM-1 increased upon Mac-1 activation. Moreover, by comparing the dynamic force spectra of different Mac-1 mutants, we expected that Mac-1 activation is governed by the downward movement of its 7 helix. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction
Integrins are a family of cell surface adhesion molecules composed of  heterodimers. They regulate many important cell­ cell and cell­extracellular matrix interactions. Mac-1, one member of the CD18 (2) integrin subfamily, is expressed primarily on myeloid cells and plays a vital role in host defense, including extravasation of phagocytic cells to inflamed organs where the

adhesion of myeloid cells to endothelial cells is a key process [1]. The myeloid cell adhesion process is mediated by the binding of Mac-1 with its major ligand ICAM-1 (CD54), a cell surface glycoprotein consisting of five extracellular Ig-like domains [2]. An important feature of Mac-1 is its ability to change ligand-binding activity in response to cellular signaling events (e.g., "inside­out" signaling), which enables its proper execution of diverse physiological functions. The loss of this capability

may lead to inappropriate engagement of Mac-1, resulting in sustained inflammation, reperfusion injury and severe tissue damage, etc. [3]. Therefore, the study of the ligand-binding property of Mac-1 and the molecule basis for its different activity is of critical importance. Several intracellular signaling pathways for Mac-1 activation have been well documented [4]. In addition, Mac-1 can be activated directly by some extracellular metal ions (Mn2+) [5] and Abs [6], and certain mutations in the cytoplasmic tails of its  and  subunits [7]. Previous studies have indicated that Mac-1 can be constrained in the inactive state by the association of its  (M) and  (2) cytoplasmic domains. During "inside­out" signaling, this association is broken and subsequently an "open" conformation in Mac-1 ectodomain is induced for an enhanced ligand-binding activity [7]. However, these studies are all based on the whole-cell adhesion assays without the quantitative information on the ligand-binding strength under different Mac-1 activation states. Recent years have seen the increasing applications of AFM to the study of biomolecular interaction force at the single-molecule level, which offers a new approach to investigate the molecular basis of cell adhesion [8­15]. In this study, we have studied the ICAM-1 binding activity of Mac-1 by direct measuring Mac-1/ICAM-1 interaction force in living cells with single-molecule force spectroscopy. It was found that after activation, Mac-1 showed increased binding probability and binding force with ICAM-1. We also proposed that the 7 helix in the M I domain is the structural element governing the transition of Mac-1 to its active state.

panded on a 3-day cycle. For transient transfection, cells grown to 80­90% confluence in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were transfected with 4 g pEYFP-N1-M (or pEYFP) plasmid and 4 g pECFP-N1-2 (or pECFP) plasmid using LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen). For the truncation mutants, 4 g pEYFP-N1-M1130 was co-transfected with 4 g pECFP-N1-2 and 0.4 g pEYFP. The co-transfection efficiency was over 90%.

Cell adhesion assay
For the analysis of Mac-1-mediated cell adhesion to ICAM-1, the 8 × 8-mm2 glass coverslips coated with ICAM-1 or BSA were put into the wells of 24-well plates. The procedure of coating the proteins to the coverslips was the same as that reported for the coating of proteins to the AFM silicon substrates [13,14]. Briefly, the coverslips were first cleaned and oxidized by heating at 100 °C in piranha solution (98% H2SO4:H2O2 = 7:3 v/v) for 30 min, then transferred to a 1.0% (v/v) APTES (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) in toluene solution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The silanized coverslips were then activated by incubating them in a 0.1% glutaraldehyde solution in PBS buffer for 30 min at room temperature. For the protein immobilization, 25 g/ml ICAM-1 or 1% BSA in PBS was dropped onto the coverslips and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Nonspecific binding sites on the ICAM-1coated coverslips were further blocked with 1% BSA. The Mac-1 transfected cells or untransfected cells were harvested with 5 mM EDTA, washed and suspended in HEPES/ NaCl/glucose supplemented with 0.5 mM Mn2+ (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5/140 mM NaCl/2 mg/ml glucose/0.5 mM MnCl2) [17­20] and then dispensed into each well at 3 × 105 cells/well followed by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Subsequently, the plates were rinsed with PBS to remove nonadherent cells. The number of adherent cells was counted by optical imaging (Olympus IX71, Japan).

Materials and methods
Antibodies and proteins
The recombinant human ICAM-1 that lacks both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was purchased from R&D system. The anti-CD18 mAb TS1/18 was purchased from Pierce. The anti-CD11b mAbs CBRM1/5, ICRF44 were from Biolegend.

AFM tips functionalization
Silicon nitride (Si3N4) tips (type: NP with a radius of 20-60 nm, from Veeco) were used. The tips were first cleaned according to previously reported procedures [21]. The cleaned tips were transferred to a solution of 1.0% (v/v) MPTMS (3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane) in toluene, incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and then rinsed thoroughly with toluene. NHSPEG-MAL (N-hydroxysuccinimide-polyethylene glycol-maleimide, MW 3400, 20­40 nm long, from Nektar Therapeutics), a polyethylene glycol spacer containing an amino-reactive group (NHS) at one end and a thiol-reactive group (MAL) at the other end, was used to link ICAM-1 to the silanized tips in order to keep the immobilized ICAM-1 in a flexible state [21,22]. The silanized tips were incubated in 1 mg/ml NHSPEG-MAL in dimethyl sulfoxide for 3 h at room temperature to couple with NHS-PEG-MAL through the MAL group, and then rinsed thoroughly with dimethyl sulfoxide to remove any unbound NHS-PEG-MAL. The PEG modified tips were then immersed into ICAM-1 solution to link ICAM-1 to the tips through NHS group. By modifying flat silicon wafer with ICAM-1 under the same conditions as tip modification, the density of immobilized ICAM-1 on the tip was estimated by tapping mode AFM image of the silicon substrate. To ensure

Plasmids and mutagenesis
The constructions of pEYFP-N1-M and pECFP-N1-2 plasmids that express YFP NH2-terminus fusion protein of M and CFP NH2-terminus fusion protein of 2 were described previously [16]. The mutants D294C/Q311C and Q163C/R313C were constructed through substitution of corresponding amino acids by cysteine [17]. 1130 was constructed by truncating the  subunit cytoplasmic domain after amino acid position 1130, which was just before the conserved GFFKR sequence, and introducing a stop codon at the desired position [18]. All of the mutations were generated using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Cell culture and transfection
CHO cells were cultured with RPMI1640 (GIBCO BRL) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). Cells were cultured as monolayers in a humilified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, and ex-

the single-molecule force measurement, 10 g/ml ICAM-1 was used for immobilization, which resulted in the density of about 500 molecules/m2. The spring constants of the cantilevers, calibrated using the thermal fluctuation method [23,24], were in the range of 0.025­0.045 N/m. The uncertainty of the spring constant was estimated as 19%.

Results and discussion
Binding of Mac-1 expressed on CHO cells to surface-immobilized ICAM-1
CHO cells were co-transfected with two fluorescent protein fused Mac-1 subunits, M-YFP and 2-CFP in this study. Our previous work has demonstrated that M-YFP and 2-CFP are properly expressed in CHO cells and the two subunits could form constitutive heterodimer of Mac-1 [16]. Cell adhesion experiment was carried out firstly to examine the binding capability of Mac-1-expressing CHO cells to ICAM-1 immobilized on coverslips. Fig. 1 showed that for the cells expressing M-YFP/2-CFP (Mac-1-FP), the number of adhered cells on the ICAM-1-coated surface was much larger (more than 3-fold) than that on the BSA-coated control surface. On the other hand, similar to YFP/CFP transfected cells, the untransfected cells displayed no difference in adhesion ability to ICAM-1 and BSA surface. The result confirmed the strong binding of transfected Mac-1-FP expressed on CHO cells with its ligand ICAM1, which was immobilized on the surface. Moreover, there was no difference in ligand-binding ability between Mac-1-FP and unfused Mac-1. This demonstrated that the fluorescent proteins fused to the two Mac-1 subunits did not affect the binding properties of Mac-1.

Single-molecule force spectroscopy
Force measurements with the ICAM-1 modified AFM tip on living cell surface were carried out on PicoSPM II with PicoScan 3000 controller (Molecular Imaging). The AFM scanner was mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71) with an Hg lamp. The 35-mm culture dish containing the adherent monolayer cells was placed on the AFM stage. The fluorescence image of fluorescent proteins (YFP, CFP) was used to locate the AFM tips on the single cells expressing Mac-1 receptors. A UMWIB2 filter set was used (Ex: BP 460­490 nm, Em: LP 510 nm, Olympus, Japan) for YFP observation and a U-MWU2 filter set (Ex: BP 400­440 nm, Em: BA 475 nm, Olympus, Japan) for CFP. Measurements were carried out at room temperature using serum-free medium (PRMI1640) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES. Force measurements under Mn2+ stimulation were performed in HEPES/ NaCl/glucose buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM MnCl2. The change of cell medium was used to prevent Mn2+ precipitation, and it had no effect on the measured binding force. For the dynamic force microscopy, the retraction rate of the cantilever was varied from 1 to 20 m/s to acquire measurements at loading rates between 100 and 10,000 pN/s. To achieve single-molecule force measurement of Mac-1 and ICAM-1, the experiment conditions such as tip-cell contact time and depression force were optimized and the binding probability was controlled to be ranged from 10% to 30%. In our experiment with the retraction rate of 1 to 20 m/s, the contact time was varied from 0.04 s to 0.2 s, and the depression force from 200 pN to 700 pN. The faster the retraction rate was, the longer contact time and larger depression force were usually required. Under each experiment condition, i.e., retraction speed, resting Mac-1, activated Mac-1, Mac-1 mutants and the addition of blocking reagents, four independent sets of measurements with different AFM tips were carried out. Each set of measurement was performed on six to ten different cells with the same tip. Up to 500 force­distance curves were collected at randomly selected four to six locations on each cells. The noise of the curves was about 10­20 pN (varied with different retraction speeds), and only those abrupt shifts with signal/noise N 3 in the curves were considered as adhesion events. 1500­3000 Force curves were recorded in each experiment set. The loading rate was determined by first evaluating the slope of the force versus distance trace just before each rupture event and multiplying this number (pN/nm) by the retraction velocity (nm/s). For each experiment with the same retract velocity, the loading rates derived from the force curves were plotted in histograms and fitted with Gaussian to find the most probable loading rates [25,26]. The most probable rupture forces at each retract velocity were obtained by the construction of probability density function with the measured rupture forces [27,28]. The results were expressed as peak values ± SD.

Measurement of single-molecule force of Mac-1/ICAM-1
To measure the adhesion force between Mac-1 and its ligand ICAM-1 in living cells, the ICAM-1-coated AFM tip was directed to the Mac-1-expressing cells with the help of the optical and fluorescence imaging of cells with the combined AFM/fluorescence microscopy system. The cells emitting both YFP and CFP fluorescence were chosen as Mac-1-expressing cells to exclude the untransfected or single subunit transfected cells

Mac-1-FP transfected, Mac-1 transfected, YFP/CFP transfected and untransfected CHO cells were examined to adhere to the glass coverslips coated with ICAM-1 or BSA. Adhered cells were counted by light microscopy at 25×. The numbers of bound cells on different surfaces were normalized to that of untransfected cells on BSA. Results were mean ± SD from three independent experiments.

for our Mac-1/ICAM-1 binding study. The AFM tip was first approached and then retracted from the cell surface at randomly selected locations. To achieve the measurement of discrete adhesion forces at the single-molecule level, the experiment conditions such as contact time and the depression force, etc. had been optimized. Typical force curves were shown in Fig. 2A. When there was no adhesion between ICAM1 and CHO cell, a smooth retraction curve resembling the approach curve was observed (curve a in Fig. 2A). In contrast, if there was adhesion between the tip and cell, an abrupt shift in the retraction curve (curves b and d in Fig. 2A) was detected and the pulling force corresponding to the adhesion strength of Mac-1/ICAM-1 was measured. Occasionally, two rupture peaks were detected (curve c in Fig. 2A), which might represent two rupture events of Mac-1/ICAM-1. In those cases, only the last peak was taken into account for analysis [10]. Fig. 2B summarized the force distribution obtained by constructing empirical probability density functions from the measured unbinding force of Mac-1/ICAM-1 at the retraction speed of 10 m/s and loading rate of 3.0 ± 0.4 × 103 pN/s. The binding probabilities (probability of finding a rupture event in force­distance cycles) for ICAM-1 and the cell expressing Mac1 were about 28.9%. Based on Poisson statistics, when binding probability is b30%, N83% of the observed binding events should originate from single pair of ligand­receptor interac-

tions [29]. The lack of multiple force peaks in the force distribution also confirmed that single-molecule forces of Mac-1/ ICAM-1 were measured.

Specific binding of Mac-1/ICAM-1 in living cells
Due to the high sensitivity of AFM measurements, it is conceivable that not all of the measured forces stemmed from the Mac-1/ICAM-1 interaction. For the confirmation of specific recognition of Mac-1 by ICAM-1, we have examined the frequency of adhesion in several test and control experiments. Firstly, force measurements were performed with ICAM-1coated tip on different cells. Under the condition of 0.1­0.2 s contact time and 400­500 pN depression force, a binding probability of 28.9 ± 6.4% was observed with the ICAM-1 tip on Mac-1-expressing cells. As an indicator of specific recognition of Mac-1 by ICAM-1, a very low (6.9 ± 2.1%) binding probability was found on either the parent CHO cells or YFP/CFP transfected CHO cells which containing no Mac-1 with the same tips and under the same conditions (Fig. 3A). Moreover, there was almost no adhesion event on Mac-1-expressing cells if the tip was changed to the unmodified one (data not shown). Activation and blocking experiments have also been performed on the same cell system to confirm the specific binding between ICAM-1 on the tip and Mac-1 on the cell. It has been well known that the Mac-1 binding activity can be enhanced by Mn2+ [5,30]. Consistently, the binding probability of ICAM-1 to the Mac-1-expressing CHO cells became higher after 0.5 mM Mn2+ stimulation (Fig. 3B). Functional-blocking Mac-1 antibodies were then used to block specific ICAM-1/ Mac-1 binding. Application of antibodies against either M (CBRM1/5 and ICRF44) or 2 (TS1/18) significantly reduced the binding probability of ICAM-1 with the Mn2+ activated cells, to a level lower than that of ICAM-1 with the resting cells. CBRM1/5, an activation-dependent antibody, showed a weaker blocking effect than the other two mAbs. The possible reason is CBRM1/5 only blocked the activated Mac-1 without any effect on the adhesion of resting Mac-1 [30]. Collectively, these results indicated that the single-molecule forces measured between Mac-1-expressing CHO cells and ICAM-1 were mainly attributed to the specific interaction of Mac-1 and ICAM-1.

Dynamic strength of individual Mac-1/ICAM-1 complex
Previous radio-labeled ligand-binding assay and flow cytofluorometric study have demonstrated that Mn2+ enhances the affinity of Mac-1 for its ligands rather than its expression level on cell surface [5,30]. The higher binding probability brought by Mn2+ in our single-molecule force measurement reflected a faster on-rate (kon) of Mac-1/ICAM-1 binding after Mn2+ activation [9,11]. We then carried out dynamic force microscopy to compare the binding strength of the activated and resting Mac-1 under different AFM loading rates. An important feature of AFM force measurement is that the measured forces are not only dependent on the nature of the interaction pair, but also on the loading rate at which force is applied to rupture the complex. As shown in Fig. 4A, the unbinding force of Mac-1/ICAM-1 complex increased with the loading rate, which was consistent with the dynamic response of other receptor­ligand systems [10­12,31­33]. For example,

(A) Binding probabilities obtained with Mac-1-FP transfected cells, YFP/CFP transfected cells and untransfected cells. (B) Effect of functional blocking antibodies on Mac-1/ICAM-1 binding. Force measurements were carried out firstly with the resting cells expressing Mac-1, then with the same cells stimulated by 0.5 mM Mn2+ to activate Mac-1, and followed by the treatment with the inhibitory antibodies (40 g/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. Binding probabilities obtained after activation and blocking were normalized to that on the resting Mac-1.

the Mac-1/ICAM-1 bond could withstand the pulling force of 45 ± 5.6 pN at the loading rate of 320 pN/s. When loading rate increased to 1000 pN/s, the measured unbinding force increased to 73 ± 4.8 pN. Activation with Mn2+ could enhance the bond strength of Mac-1/ICAM-1. The Mn2+ activated Mac-1/ ICAM-1 bond could withstand the pulling force of 70 ± 5.7 pN at the loading rate of 300 pN/s and 105 ± 5.1 pN at 1000 pN/s. According to Bell model, the measured rupture force (F) of a bond is dependent on the logarithm of the loading rate (r) as follows [34,35]:     rvb vb kB T kB T kB T ¼ d ln d lnr þ d ln F¼ vb vb vb koff ð0ÞkB T koff ð0ÞkB T where T is the absolute temperature, kB is Boltzmann's constant, koff (0) is the equilibrium dissociation off-rate, is the reactive compliance of the bond. The equation predicts a linear relationship between the individual unbinding force F and lnr. From the slope and the intercept in the plot of F versus lnr, the information on the complex dissociation (the Bell mode parameters) can be de-

rived such as , koff and the binding lifetime , which is reciprocal of koff (1/koff). As shown in Fig. 4A, the rupture force of the Mac-1/ICAM-1 displayed linear increase with lnr in the loading rate range of 100­10,000 pN/s (R = 0.98). The single linear regime suggested that only a single activation barrier needs to be overcome for Mac-1/ICAM-1 dissociation in this loading rate range. The koff and  derived from the slop and intercept were 0.49 ± 0.23 s- 1 and 1.79 ± 0.11 Å for the activated Mac-1 and 2.38 ± 1.96 s- 1 and 1.62 ± 0.14 Å for the resting Mac-1. The bond lifetime of ICAM-1/ Mac-1 increased from 0.42 s to 2.0 s when Mac-1 was activated. These values fell in the same range of those reported in study of the complex of ICAM-1 with another 2 integrin, LFA-1(bond lifetime increased from 0.25 s for the rested LFA-1 to 6.0 s for the activated LFA-1 in the same loading rate range) [31]. However, two linear regimes were observed in the dynamic force spectra of ICAM-1/LFA-1, with the second loading regime appeared above 10,000 pN/s, which indicated two energy barriers of the complex dissociation. Due to the limitation of our system, we did not perform measurement with the loading rates

For fixation, Mac-1-expressing cells were first stimulated with 0.5 mM Mn2+ for 15 min and then exposed to a 1% glutaraldehyde solution for 1 min.

higher than 10,000 pN/s. It is estimated that the physiological loading rates exerted on leukocytes adhesion molecules are ranged from 100 to 10,000 pN/s [29]. So the differences in the Mac-1/ICAM-1 force spectra of this loading rate range between activated Mac-1 and resting Mac-1 correlate to the physiological function of Mac-1, i.e., Mac-1 can mediate firm adhesion of myeloid cells to endothelial cells after activation. Worthy of mention is that dynamic force microscopy had also been used in our study to verify the measured singlemolecule force was due to the rupture of Mac-1/ICAM-1 complex instead of extracting receptor molecules from the cell. This was achieved by comparing the dynamic force spectra obtained on the Mac-1-expressing living cells and cells fixed by a briefly exposure to 1% glutaraldehyde solution [31]. The glutaraldehyde linked Mac-1 with other membrane proteins and cytoskeleton components to prevent it from being extracted out of cell. The result showed the force spectrum of the Mn2+-stimulated Mac-1/ICAM-1 complex on the fixed cells overlapped with that on the living cells (Fig. 4B). This indicated that Mac-1 remained attached to the membrane when force measurements were performed on living cells. In addition, the uprooting of Mac-1 was further excluded by checking the loss of functionality of the ICAM-1 modified tip [10]. Under each condition, the measurement was carried out with the same tip to approach and retract from the cell for thousands of times. The binding probability between tip and cell remained constant (20­30%) instead of decreased to the level of nonspecific adhesion (about 7%). On the other hand, the overlapped dynamic force spectra of Mac-1/ICAM-1 on the living cells and fixed cells confirmed that

the small lateral mobility of Mac-1 on the cell membrane did not affect the living cell single-molecule force measurement.

7 helix of Mac-1 I domain governs the activation Mac-1
With a faster on-rate and slower off-rate, our single-molecule force spectroscopy results indicated a higher binding constant of the activated Mac-1 with ICAM-1, thus the different molecular structure of Mac-1 between its resting and active state. We further performed dynamic force microscopy study of several Mac-1 mutants to analyze the molecular structure of the activated Mac-1. It is known that the binding sites of Mac-1/ICAM-1 have been localized to the M I (the -chain of Mac-1 contains an inserted (I) domain of 200 residues) domain of Mac-1 and the third NH2-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain of ICAM-1 [36,37]. The crystal structures of Mac-1 extracellular I domains reveal that they contain a dinucleotide binding fold composed of a central -sheet surrounded by seven  helices [38]. On the upper face there is a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which is involved in the binding of Mac-1 to its protein ligands. Two different crystal forms of the M I domain, termed "open" and "closed" forms, have been obtained, and it has been hypothesized that the two structures represent the active and inactive conformation of Mac-1 respectively. The two conformers differ in both the location of C-terminal -helix (7 helix) and the residues that coordinate the metal ion in the MIDAS. Comparing to the "closed" conformer, there is a dramatic 10 Å movement of the 7 helix down the body of I domain in the "open" conformer. It is proposed that the MIDAS

residue shift in the two conformers is also structurally linked to the downward movement of 7 helix [39]. Based on the crystal structure of the two conformers, Springer et al. [17] stabilized Mac-1 I domains in either "open" or "closed" conformation by engineering disulfide bonds that linked 7 helix to the neighboring regions in the I domain. The mutant D294C/Q311C, which was designed to stabilize the "open" conformation of the M I domain by pulling down the C-terminal 7 helix, did show increased binding activity to iC3b (another ligand of Mac-1 which has the same binding site on Mac-1 as ICAM-1 [36]) in the whole-cell adhesion assay. In contrast, the mutant Q163C/R313C, which was designed to stabilize the M in the "closed" conformation by constraining the pull-down of 7, showed weak binding with iC3b. To test whether the structure of the Mn2+ activated Mac-1 was related to the "open" conformation, we constructed the same two Mac-1 mutants, expressed them in the cells and measured their rupture forces with ICAM-1 under different loading rates. As shown in Fig. 5A, the complex of ICAM-1 with D294C/Q311C mutant had an almost superimposed dynamic force spectrum as that with Mn2+ activated wild-type Mac-1. On the other hand, Q163C/R313C mutant showed no specific binding with ICAM-1. The binding probability of ICAM-1coated tips on the Q163C/R313C transfected cells was as low as that on the untransfected cells, and it did not increase in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 5D). These indicated that Mac-1 with the "open" mutational I domain is constitutively activated, while the "closed" Q163C/R313C mutant lacks ligand-binding ability and resists activation. We were also interested in whether the Mac-1 activation by extracellular Mn2+ and by "inside­out" signaling has the same molecular basis. It has been demonstrated that cytoplasmic association of integrin  and  subunits constrains an integrin in the inactive conformation [7]. In the "inside­out" signal pathway, the inducing of high-affinity integrin on activation is due to the unclasping and separation of the cytoplasmic tails of  and  subunits, leading to changes in the conformation and/or orientation of  and  subunit ectodomains, thus creating the "open" conformation of integrin that binds to ligands with higher affinity. Truncation of the L and IIb cytoplasmic domains or internal deletion of the conserved GFFKR of integrin has been reported to mimic the "inside­out" signaling and results in the constitutive activation of L2 and IIb3, other integrin proteins like Mac-1 [18,40]. In this study, we truncated the M cytoplasmic domain before the GFFKR sequence (named 1130), and found that this mutant constitutively bound to ICAM-1 with high affinity. The dynamic force spectrum of 1130/ICAM-1 was nearly identical to that of Mn2+ activated wild-type Mac-1/ICAM-1 (Fig. 5B). When combined the cytoplasmic truncation with D294C/Q311C "open" state mutation (D294C/Q311C/1130), the unbinding force of D294C/Q311C/1130 with ICAM-1 did not show additional enhancement comparing to either D294C/Q311C or 1130 (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the mutant Q163C/R313C/1130 which combined the cytoplasmic truncation with Q163C/R313C "closed" state mutation showed no specific binding to ICAM-1 as Q163C/ R313C (Fig. 5D). Considering the almost identical dynamic force spectra for ICAM-1 with Mn2+ activated Mac-1, Mac-1 "open" state mutant and cytoplasmic domain truncated Mac-1 mutant, it is sug-

gested that all these forms of Mac-1 are likely derived from the structurally identical I domain. The constraint of 7 helix downward movement impaired the activation effect of Mn2+ and "inside­out" signaling mimicked by M cytoplasmic domain truncation. Thus it is expected that 7 helix downward movement is a crucial step for Mac-1 activation. The activation signals (either from Mn2+ or "inside­out") to the Mac-1 I domain finally result in the pulling down of its C-terminal 7 helix. In summary, we have measured the interaction force of integrin Mac-1/ICAM-1 at single molecular resolution in living cells using AFM. We observed that after Mn2+ activation there was an increase in the ligand-binding affinity of Mac-1, as it showed both higher adhesion probability and larger binding force with ICAM-1 on activation to resist external force that exists under physiological circumstance. Furthermore, the dynamic force spectroscopy of ICAM-1 with activated Mac-1 was compared to those with different Mac-1 mutants. The results implicated that activation of Mac-1 affinity may be governed by the downward movement of the 7 helix in its I domain.
