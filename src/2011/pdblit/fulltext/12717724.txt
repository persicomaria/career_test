Surprising Roles of Electrostatic Interactions in DNA­Ligand Complexes*

Abstract: The positions of cations in x-ray structures are modulated by sequence, conformation, and ligand interactions. The goal here is to use x-ray diffraction to help resolve structural and thermodynamic roles of specifically localized cations in DNA­anthracycline complexes. We de° scribe a 1.34 A resolution structure of a CGATCG2­adriamycin2 complex obtained from crystals grown in the presence of thallium (I) ions. Tl can substitute for biological monovalent cations, but is readily detected by distinctive x-ray scattering, obviating analysis of subtle differences in coordination geometry and x-ray scattering of water, sodium, potassium, and ammonium. Six localized Tl sites are observable adjacent to each CGATCG2­adriamycin2 complex. Each of these localized monovalent cations are found within the G-tract major groove of the intercalated DNA­ drug complex. Adriamycin appears to be designed by nature to interact favorably with the electrostatic landscape of DNA, and to conserve the distribution of localized cationic charge. Localized inorganic cations in the major groove are conserved upon binding of adriamycin. In the minor groove, inorganic cations are substituted by a cationic functional group of adriamycin. This partitioning of cationic charge by adriamycin into the major groove of CG base pairs and the minor groove of AT base pairs may be a general feature of sequence-specific DNA­small molecule interactions and a potentially useful important factor in ligand design. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

FIGURE 1 Chemical structure of adriamycin. Daunomycin is similar to adriamycin but lacks the 14-hydroxyl group. The circles and pie-shaped elements represent water molecules. A shaded full circle indicates that a water molecule interacts with the associated oxygen or nitrogen in 100% of the surveyed structures. The pie-shaped elements indicate quantitatively the fraction of structures in which a water molecule interacts with the oxygen or nitrogen atom. The circles that contain plus signs indicate sites monovalent cations determined here. The nonshaded cation is nearly identical to the location of sodium ions in previous structures.

described here are to use x-ray diffraction to resolve these discrepancies, and more generally, to help determine roles of localized cations and electrostatic forces in structure, thermodynamics, and sequence specificity of DNA­ligand complexes. Our results suggest that favorable interactions of adriamycin with the sequence-specific electrostatic landscape of DNA are universal characteristics of DNA­small molecule interactions and may be useful in sequence-specific ligand design. Anthracyclines bind preferentially at pyrimidine­ purine steps5 (an example is shown in Figure 2) and cause DNA damage in vivo by interfering with the action of topoisomerase II.6 The DNA binding energetics of daunomycin were experimentally decomposed by Chaires and co-workers into functionalgroup-specific contributions7. The daunosamine contributes a large and favorable binding free energy (2 kcal mol 1). The 3 -amino group contributes 0.7 kcal mol 1 above the polyelectrolyte contribution of the positive charge. The hydroxyl groups at the 9 and 14 positions contribute approximately 1 kcal mol 1. Chaires also identified water as an important thermo-

dynamic participant, observing an uptake of water accompanying formation of DNA­anthracycline complexes.8 The thermodynamic results are consistent with three-dimensional structure determinations of a series of DNA­anthracycline complexes.1,2,9,10 The three-dimensional structures demonstrate that the daunosamine is in intimate contact with the DNA; hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts secure the daunosamine to the floor of the minor groove. The 9-hydroxy group forms multiple hydrogen bonds with a flanking guanine. A large number of solvent molecules are conserved in crystal structures of DNA­ anthracycline complexes.2 The role of cations and electrostatics is less well characterized. Identifying localized cations by x-ray diffraction presents nontrivial analytical challenges. Sodium ions (Na ), potassium ions (K ), rubidium ions (Rb ), cesium ions (Cs ), ammonium ions, and water molecules, and even polyamines and divalent cations, compete for similar sites adjacent DNA or RNA.11­13 Various species bind with partial and mixed occupancies in x-ray structures. Na and ammonium scatter x-rays with nearly the same power as water or par-

tially occupied K . Each of these species has irregular and variable coordination. Therefore the solvent­ion environment can be difficult to fit unambiguously during structure refinement. For these reasons, the inferred variability in cation interactions in previous DNA­anthracycline complexes may be real, or may arise from difficulties in characterization of cation positions by x-ray diffraction. A well-developed K substitute with a distinctive x-ray scattering fingerprint that obviates interpretation of subtle differences in coordination geometry and scattering power is provided by thallium (Tl ). Tl and K (a) have similar ° ° ionic radii [K 1.33 A, Tl 1.49 A]14 and enthalpies of hydration [K 77 kcal mol 1, Tl 1 15 78 kcal mol ]. Tl can substitute for K in the catalytic mechanisms of sodium­potassium pumps,16 fructose-1-6-bisphosphatase,17 and pyruvate kinase.18 Tl has been shown by NMR to stabilize guanine tetraplexes in a manner analogous to K and ammonium.19 We have used Tl as a marker for sites of K localization adjacent to B-DNA.13 Doudna and co-workers used Tl as a marker for sites of K localization tetrahymena ribozyme P4 ­P6 domain.20 Tl was used by Caspar and co-workers to determine counterion positions adjacent to insulin,21,22 and by Gill and Eisenberg to determine the location of ammonium ions in the binding pocket of glutamine syn° thetase.23 Here we describe a 1.34 A resolution structure of a CGATCG2­adriamycin2 complex obtained from crystals grown in the presence of Tl . Our goal is to use Tl to determine locations of monovalent cations in DNA­anthracycline complexes. The RESULTs indicate that adriamycin interacts favorably with the asymmetric electrostatic landscape of DNA. Asymmetric cation localization is conserved and even enhanced upon binding of adriamycin.

plate detector. The amount of 360° of reciprocal space data ° were collected at 180°C; 31,250 reflections to 1.26 A resolution were reduced to a unique dataset containing 5559 reflections, preserving Bijvoet pairs using the dtprocess software in the program CrystalClear 1.3.0 (Rmerge 4.2%, 89.7% complete, F/F 0.083). Unit cell dimensions are a ° b 27.89 A, c 52.27, 90° in space group P41212. Data used for refinement included 5034 reflections ° from 35 to 1.34 A. (See Table I.)

Refinement
A starting model consisting of coordinates of a published CGATCG2­adriamycin2 complex (NDB entry DDF044)4 ° was annealed and refined against the 1.34 A CGATCG2­ adriamycin2­Tl data with the program CNS, using the parameters of Berman and co-workers.24 ­26 The restraints for adriamycin were adapted from the small-molecule crystal structure of daunomycin.27 The program O version 6.4B,28 was used for viewing and manipulating molecular models and viewing electron density maps, which were clear, detailed and continuous (Figure 3). Water molecules were added iteratively to peaks of corresponding sum and difference density followed by refinement and phase calculation. A subset of water molecules were converted to Tl ions during the refinement. The conversions were based on the presence of persistent F0 Fc difference density superimposed on water molecules (Figure 3B). No attempt was made to bias the assignment of Tl ions in the refinement toward previously published sodium ion assignments. Neither Mg2 nor spermine was apparent in electron density maps.

Anomalous Difference Fouriers
2F0 Fc peaks were assigned as Tl ions only if Tl occupancy is indicated in both F0 Fc and Bijvoet difference (F F ) Fourier maps. F F maps were ° calculated using data to 1.4 A and phases from the final refined CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl model, minus water and ions. Pairs of reflections with F / (F) 1.0 for either Bijvoet pair were excluded. The most intense peak (30 ) in ° the F F map (Figure 3C) is 0.05 A from the most highly occupied Tl site determined from the refinement (Tl 1). A shoulder (6 ) on the 30 peak is nearly superimposed on another Tl site determined during the refinement (Tl 2). The F F electron density surrounding Tl 1 and Tl 2 is similar in size and shape to the F0 Fc Fourier electron density. An additional F F peak ° (4.3 ) is 0.18 A from the third Tl site determined in the refinement (Tl 3). Additional peaks observed in the vicinity of Tl 3 in the F F map (Figure 3C) were not assigned as Tl ions because of a lack of evidence for Tl at these sites in F0 Fc maps. The most intense, a peak of ° 4.5 , is 0.43 A from a water molecule (W81). Some remaining peaks in the F F map correspond to anomalous signals from phosphorus atoms of the DNA, as observed previously.29 The F F Fourier map corre-

MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization and Data Collection
Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion from sitting drops of a solution initially containing 2.3 mM of the ammonium salt of reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified d(CGATCG) (Midland Certified Reagent Company in Midland, TX), 27.5 mM thallium acetate (pH 6.4), 2.2 mM Mg2 acetate, 4.5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 1.3 mM spermine acetate, and 2.5 mM of the chloride salt of adriamycin (Sigma), equilibrated against a solution of 35% MPD. A tetragonal crystal grew to 0.4 0.2 0.2 mm3 within a few weeks. Data were collected ° with 1.54 A Cu K radiation on an in-house Rigaku/MSC RU-H3R rotating anode generator equipped with Osmic blue multilayer confocal optics and an RAXIS-IV image

The occupancies were estimated during the refinement by manually minimizing the magnitudes of the F0 Fc and Fc F0 peaks. Tl occupancies were not automatically refined.

Superimpositions
Superimpositions were performed using the program ProFit.30 Guanine residues adjacent to monovalent cations in NDB entries listed in Table II were superimposed on G(2) of CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl . All atoms of the purine ring system were used in the superimpositions. The ° average root mean square deviation (RMSD) was 0.04A, ° and all were less than 0.07A. The ions in the superimposition set were grouped according to their distances from O6 and N7 and the plane of the guanine base. To determine if the binding modes were statistically distinct, the mean position and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each group. In pairwise comparisons of the four groups, the distance between the mean positions were greater than sum of the confidence intervals, indicating differences in the four groups were statistically significant. Determination of DNA­anthracycline hydration patterns utilized sixteen complexes [Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) IDs: DD000,31, DDF001,1, DDF020,2, DDF022,32, DDF023,33, DDF026,34 DDF035,9 DDF041,35 DDF044,4 DDF045,4 DDF062,36 DDFB24,33 DDFB25,34 DDFB70,37 DDFP21,3 and the structure described here]. For evaluation of major groove ligand interactions, the purine ring atoms of G(2) of three bis-intercalative complexes (NDB IDs: DD0018, DDD030, and DDDB46) was superimposed on G(2) of the current model.

RESULTS
Tl does not perturb the conformation of the DNA or the DNA­ drug interactions in the CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl complex. The conformation and DNA­ drug interactions of the low temperature (LT) CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl complex are similar to those in previous room temperature2 (RT) and LT4 structures of CGATCG2­adriamycin2 obtained from crystals grown with Na as the primary monovalent cation. Each complex (biological unit) consists of CGATCG2­adriamycin2, a DNA hexamer duplex plus two intercalated adriamycin molecules (Figure 2), and contains two crystallographic asymmetric

units related by a twofold axis. The biological unit is numbered 5 C(1)G(2) G(6) 3 and 5 C(7)G(8) G(12) 3 . The chromophore is intercalated at the d(CpG) step, between base pairs C(1)­G(12) and G(2)­C(11) and by symmetry at the identical intercalation site at the other end of the complex. The aminosugar is located within the minor groove. The 3 amino group interacts favorably with three oxygen ° atoms, the T(10) O2 (NOO distance 3.0A), the ° ), and C(11) O4 (3.2A). The 9-hy° C(11) O2 (3.1A

droxyl oxygen forms hydrogen bonds to both the N2 and N3 atoms of G(2). The adriamycin B­D ring systems (including their coplanar substituents) are in close van der Waals contact with the flanking base pairs. Fourteen atoms of B­D ring systems are within ° 3.4 A of 23 DNA base atoms. The combined structural results demonstrate that the anthracycline system is anchored within the minor groove, by a combination of direct drug­DNA interactions and water-mediated interactions. The anthra-

94

Howerton, Nagpal, and Williams

cycline is anchored at the other end, in the major groove, by water and ion-mediated interactions. The central portion of the intercalated chromophore engages in extensive stacking contacts with adjacent base pairs. The stacking interactions confer stability. An element of directionality to stacking interactions is suggested by the observation that the shortest subset ° of stacking contacts ( 3.2A) are between oxygen atoms and electron deficient carbon atoms. The anchoring interactions within the grooves, in possible conjunction with directional stacking interactions, restrict the intercalated chromophore to a well-defined and highly conserved position relative to the flanking base pairs.

Tl Ions
Specific localization of Tl ions is apparent from both F0 Fc and F F Fourier electron density maps calculated with CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl data (Figure 3). The final model of CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl contains six partially occupied Tl sites (Figure 2). Three of these sites are crystallographically unique. All three localized Tl sites are within the major groove. None are adjacent to phosphate groups or are involved in lattice interactions. Each site is directly coordinated by functional groups of guanine bases, and in some cases also by those of the intercalated adriamycin chromophore. Tl sites are chelated by oxygen and basic endocyclic nitrogen atoms of DNA bases, but not by exocyclic amino nitrogen atoms. Each Tl site is in contact with a guanine N7 position, and each guanine N7 position is in contact with a Tl site. The localized Tl ions are partially dehydrated. The water coordination numbers appear to be low, from 1 to 3. However, we must interpret the water interactions of Tl with caution because water molecules scatter very weakly in comparison to Tl . A 30% occupied Tl ion would be clearly visible in the electron density maps while a water molecule with the same occupancy would probably not be assignable. The DNA and adriamycin combine to form a tetrachelator for the most highly occupied Tl site (Tl 1; about 50% occupancy, Figures 1 and 2). The Tl 1 ° ° site is chelated by O6 (2.90A) and N7 (2.75A) atoms ° ) and O5 (3.11 A) atoms ° of G(6) and by the O4 (3.11 A of adriamycin. This Tl site is located in the plane of the guanine base. The adriamycin C4 ­O4 ­Tl and C5­O5­Tl angles are acute (103°). The Tl 1 site is distinct from a previously identified Na site1,2 that is trichelated by the DNA­adriamycin complex. The Na site is nearly superimposable a less highly occupied Tl site (Tl 2; about 20% occupancy). The Tl

2 site was assigned to a Mg2 in several structures,33,34 although the coordination geometry in those structures is most consistent with a water mol° ecule or a monovalent cation. The Tl 2 site is 1.4 A from the Tl 1 site and unlike the Tl 1 site does not ° interact with the O6 of G(6) (4.0 A). Tl 2 forms ° contacts with the N7 atom of G(6) (2.72 A), and the ° ) and O5 (3.03 A) atoms of adriamycin. ° O4 (3.14 A The occupancies of Tl 2 and Tl 1 must be exclusive. In a given complex either Tl 2 or Tl 1 is occupied by an ion; both sites would not be simultaneously occupied by ions. A third Tl site (Tl 3; about 20% occupied), is also located in the major groove, but on the opposite side of the adriamycin ° chromophore. Tl 3 interacts with O6 (2.80 A) and ° ) atoms of G(2). The closest approach of N7 (2.91 A ° Tl 3 to adriamycin is 3.72 A, from O12, suggesting at most a weak interaction between Tl 3 and adriamycin. This partially dehydrated monovalent cation falls well within the volume occupied by a Mg(H2O)2 observed in several previous DNA­an6 thracycline complexes.35,37 Neither Mg2 nor spermine is observable in the electron density of the CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl complex. DNA­anthracycline complexes are characterized by variable spermine positions and occupancies.2,32 If spermine is contained within the CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl crystal, it is not sufficiently ordered to be observable and may lie within the disordered solvent channels between the duplexes.

Consensus Modes of Monovalent Cation Localization
A survey of the NDB38 reveals that 103 localized monovalent cations (Na , K , Rb , Cs , or Tl ) are contained in 37 nucleic acid entries of better than 2.0 ° A resolution. These localized cations engage in a total of 376 contacts (149, values in parentheses exclude ° G-tetraplexes) of less than 3.5 A with nitrogen and oxygen atoms of DNA or RNA. Most interactions of these localized monovalent cations, 87% (69%), are with bases, rather than backbone atoms. The majority of interactions, 89% (74%), are with oxygen atoms rather than nitrogen atoms. The O6 position of guanine is preferred, accounting for 64% (19%) of interactions. The sugar oxygen atoms (O2 , O3 , O4 plus O5 ) account for 7% (15%) of interactions. The O1P and O2P phosphate oxygen atoms similarly combine to engage in 7% (16%) of interactions. The O2 of T and U combine to account for 6% (9%) of interactions. These T O2 interactions are predominantly (86%) in B-form DNA. The only exceptions are in abbreviated A-form dinucleotide structures. The O4

of T and U combine to account for 5% (11%) of interactions. These O4 interactions are exclusively in A-form DNA or RNA, with no occurrences in B-form DNA. The N7 of guanine is preferred among nitrogen atoms, engaging in 5% (12%) of interactions. Significant numbers of localized cations with contacts with other nitrogen atoms are not contained in the comparison set. Localized monovalent cations adjacent to guanine are clustered into four distinct groups. Twenty-nine of ° the cations found in the NDB are located within 5.0 A of both O6 and N7 of a given guanine residue (these criteria exclude cations in G-tetraplexes). Four of these ions are associated with an additional guanine base such that 33 cation contacts involve 31 guanine

residues, in addition to the complex described here. A superimposition of these 31 guanine residues suggests that the 33 cation positions are distributed into four statistically distinct regions relative to the N7 and O6 atoms of guanine and the plane of the guanine base (Figure 4A). One group (G O6/N7-bridging cations) is composed of cations that are located close to the ° plane of the base and are less than 3.5 A from both N7 and O6 of the same guanine. Most of the G O6/N7bridging cations are adjacent to duplex B-DNA or A-RNA. Two of the Tl ions of the structure described here are O6/N7-bridging cations. The second group (G O6 cations) is composed of ions that are located close to the plane of the base and are less than ° ° 3.5 A from O6 but greater than 3.5 A from N7. Most

96

of the G O6 cations are adjacent to duplex B-DNA or A-RNA. The third group (G N7/DRU cations, for drug, because these ions interact with a bound drug and the N7 of G) is composed of ions that are less than ° ° 3.5 A from N7 and greater than 3.5 A from O6. With the exception of one sodium ion that interacts with an adjacent phosphate group of RNA, all cations that contact N7 and not O6 of a given G are in contact with oxygen atoms of an intercalated anthracycline. One of the Tl ions of the structure described here is a N7/DRU cation. A fourth group (DIN cations, for dinucleotide, because these ions interact with bases of a dinucleotide step) are in contact most generally with the O6, but in some cases with the N7, of a guanine (the primary guanine) and with a second exocyclic oxygen atom. The second exocyclic oxygen atom is either the O4 of a 3 thymine or uracil residue of an A-form GpT or GpU step or the O6 of a 3 crossstrand guanine residue of a B-form GpC step. DIN cations are displaced from the plane of primary guanine, in the 3 direction.

flanking pyrimidine. A second water bridge links the 3-amino group to the O2 (T) or N3 (A) position on the floor of the minor groove. A third bridging site involves the O4 and O5 positions. This set of bridging interactions is highly conserved, but the composition of the bridge appears to be variable. The bridge is composed of water molecules in some structures and ions in others. On average, carbonyl oxygens are more highly hydrated than hydroxyl oxygens. Hydroxyl groups 9, 11, and 6 are "buried" in the complex and do not interact with solvent.

Experimental Variability
Fully occupied Na ions are contained at a single site in the major groove of several previous DNA­adriamycin and DNA­ daunomycin complexes, coordinating O4 and O5 of daunomycin and N7 of guanosine.1,2 Other DNA­anthracycline complexes lack monovalent cations. Here we observed three partially occupied monovalent cation sites. The variation might arise in part from differences in properties of Tl and Na ions, and from differences in crystallization conditions. An additional source of variation is probably associated with differences in experimental data. Tl is distinguished from water by differential x-ray scattering. Na ions and water molecules, in contrast, are nearly indistinguishable by x-ray scattering. The fully occupied Na site was assigned to those models by geometric criteria. By that method it might be very difficult to characterize a mixed occupancy site.

Consensus Water Localization
As noted previously,2 several water molecules appear to be conserved in DNA­anthracycline structures. Here, the analysis of water localization has been extended to include more recent high resolution DNA­ anthracycline structures, with four crystal forms and variety of DNA sequences and anthracycline modifications. We have determined the average water population at consensus sites, summarized by pie representations in Figure 1. The average water population at a specific site is defined here by the total number of water molecules in the comparison set that interact with a given anthracycline functional group, normalized to the number of structures that contain that functional group. For example, adriamycin contains a hydroxyl group at the 14 position whereas daunomycin does not. There are five adriamycin structures in the comparison set. In those five structures a total of nine waters are within the distance threshold to give an average of 1.8 water molecules per 14-OH group (Figure 1). All DNA­anthracycline structures with ° resolution better than 1.8 A were included in the comparison set, except NDB entry DDF035, which displays unreasonable geometry. Water sites were defined by proximity to oxygen or nitrogen atoms of the ° anthracycline. A site is defined by riw 3.4A, where "i" is an anthracycline atom and "w" is a water molecule. Some of the most highly conserved water molecules form bridges from anthracycline to DNA. A universally conserved bridging water molecule links the anthracycline O13 position to the O2 of a

DISCUSSION
The positions of cations in x-ray structures are modulated by sequence, conformation, and ligand interactions. Six localized Tl sites are observable adjacent to each CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl complex. Each of these localized monovalent cations is found within the G-tract major groove of the intercalated DNA­ drug complex (Figure 2). Tl ions interact with N7 and O6 atoms of guanine residues and with oxygen atoms of the intercalated adriamycin chromophore (Figure 1). Consistent with previous observations,13,39 localized cations in the CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl avoid exocyclic amino groups of DNA, which are relatively electropositive. Similarly, the localized cations adjacent to CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl are not found to be adjacent to phosphate groups or to be involved in lattice interactions. The combined results, including recent work by ourselves and others,12,40 the survey of the NDB described here, and the struc-

ture of CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl described here, suggest general patterns of monovalent cation localization. Localized monovalent cations (a) partially dehydrate and interact directly with the functional groups of nucleic acid bases and ligands; (b) interact preferentially with oxygen atoms over nitrogen atoms; (c) interact with basic endocyclic nitrogen positions of DNA bases but not with exocyclic amino nitrogen atoms; (d) are most commonly found in the major groove; (e) when in the major groove of A-form or B-form duplexes associate preferentially with guanine; (f) when in the major groove of A-form duplexes, but not B-form duplexes, commonly associate with the O4 of thymine; (g) when in the minor groove of B-form duplexes associate preferentially with the O2 of thymine; (h) can interact simultaneously with ligand and DNA.

ecule (O4 and O5). Thus the intercalation of adriamycin at a CpG step can apparently increase the monovalent cation coordination number from a maximum of three in unliganded B-DNA13 to four. This increase in coordination number appears to be associated with increased Tl occupancy. A third Tl site (Tl 3) in the CGATCG2­adriamycin2­Tl structure occupies the region in the major groove where a Mg(H2O)2 complex is located in several previous 6 DNA­anthracycline structures.35,37 The location of this shared monovalent and divalent cation site is consistent with the general pattern of cation localization in the major groove of G-tracts.13

Asymmetric Electrostatic Landscape: The Minor Groove
Monovalent cations localize in the minor groove of B-DNA A-tracts.12,40 Some of these cations would be displaced by the cationic amino group of adriamycin. The position and DNA interactions of this amino group are similar to those of localized monovalent cations. Like monovalent cations in the minor groove of B-DNA, the amino group in the CGATCG2­adriamycin2 complex interacts with the O2 atoms of pyrimidines and the O4 atoms of deoxyriboses. Therefore the localization of cationic charge is preserved in the minor groove of B-DNA, but by a substitution mechanism rather than by retention of prepositioned cations, as in the major groove (above).

Asymmetric Electrostatic Landscape: The Major Groove
In B-form DNA, cation localization is asymmetric in that the major groove edge of G-tracts and the minor groove edge of A-tracts favor cation localization. Partially dehydrated monovalent cations,13 hydrated divalent cations,41,42 and polyamines39,42 localize in a common region in the major groove of B-form CGCGAATTCGCG. The O6 and N7 of guanine residues chelate the ions directly (most common for monovalent cations) or via water molecules (most common for divalent cations). In at least a subset of dodecamer x-ray structures a Mg(H2O)2 complex within the 6 CGCGAATTCGCG major groove shares occupancy with monovalent cations.13 Here we demonstrate that monovalent cation localization can be maintained within the major groove after specific types of DNA ligand binding and deformation, such as intercalation of an anthracycline. Adriamycin appears to be designed by nature to interact favorably with, and possibly enhance, the asymmetric electrostatic landscape surrounding BDNA. Prepositioned monovalent cations adjacent to unliganded B-DNA are retained, and interact favorably with the intercalated anthracycline and with DNA. The interactions involve various combinations of the N7 and O6 positions of guanine and the O4 and O5 positions of the anthracycline. The anthracycline chromophore acts in concert with the DNA in stabilizing localized cations, which in turn contributes to a preorganized binding environment for adriamycin. The most highly occupied cation site in the structure described here (Tl 1, Figures 2B and 2C) is tetracoordinated by the DNA­ drug complex, by a guanine residue (N7 and O6) and an adriamycin mol-

Ligand Design
Favorable interaction of localized inorganic cations and cationic functional groups of adriamycin with the asymmetric electrostatic environment of DNA may be a general, but unrecognized, feature of DNA­small molecule interactions. Some previously characterized minor groove binders43,44 and anthracyclines position cationic functional groups adjacent to the minor groove edges of AT base pairs, and so replace recently discovered localized inorganic cations.12,40 Previously characterized major groove binders45­ 48 position cationic functional groups adjacent to the major groove edges of CG base pairs, and so replace recently discovered localized inorganic cations (Figure 4B). In fact, favorable interaction of cationic charge at the N7/O6 bridging position provides a compelling structural rationale for the major groove selectivity of the bipypiridine linker of ditercalinium. Positioning of the linker in the major groove allows cationic amino groups to mimic inorganic cations and complement the electronegative functional groups of DNA bases. If the linker were switched to the minor

groove of the GC-tract recognition sequence, cationic amino groups of the linker would be unfavorably positioned near electropositive amino groups of DNA. Thus the asymmetric electrostatic landscape of DNA appears to drive groove selection. To our knowledge, complementarily to the sequence-specific asymmetrical electronegative functional groups of DNA has not been explicitly or deliberately incorporated into the design of DNAbinding ligands. In one example of how this design strategy might be implemented, substitution of a OCH2ONH3 at the O4 position of adriamycin would place a cation in the O6/N7 bridging position of an adjacent guanine and should increase affinity and specificity.
