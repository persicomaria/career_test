Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. Current work for the development of new drugs against this pathology includes evaluation of enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which first requires a clear understanding of their function and mechanism of action. In this context, we focused on T. brucei 6-phosphogluconolactonase (Tb6PGL), which converts -6-phosphogluconolactone into 6-phosphogluconic acid in the second step of the PPP. We have determined the crystal structure of Tb6PGL in complex with two ligands, 6-phosphogluconic acid and citrate, at 2.2 Å and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on Tb6PGL in its empty form and in complex with -6-phosphogluconolactone, its natural ligand. Analysis of the structural data and MD simulations allowed us to propose a detailed enzymatic mechanism for 6PGL enzymes.

Introduction
African sleeping sickness is caused by the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tsetse fly. Current efforts for the development of new drugs against this very disabling pathology include evaluation of enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism as potential drug targets. The trypanosome parasites have organelles, the glycosomes, where the first seven steps of glycolysis and the first steps of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) take place.1 This localization is expected to confer to the corresponding enzymes distinct properties compared to their human homologues, which could be exploited for drug development.2 Briefly, glucose is metabolized in the cell either by glycolysis or by the PPP. Glycolysis provides pyruvate and energy by generation of ATP, while the PPP provides reductive power by generation of NADPH and conversion of glucose 6-phosphate into ribulose 5-phosphate. Several of these enzymes are being studied in attempts to develop specific inhibitors.3,4 However, before developing potential drugs, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the structure and the enzymatic mechanism of the enzymes of these

pathways, in order to identify the best drug targets. In this context, we focused on T. brucei (Tb) 6-phosphogluconolactonase (Tb6PGL; entry Q385D6 in the UniprotKB/TrEMBL database), the second enzyme of the PPP, which hydrolyses -6phosphogluconolactone (called lactone in the following) into 6-phosphogluconic acid (6PGA) (see Fig. 1a).5 Tb6PGL belongs to the 6PGL family EC 3.1.1.31. Besides its 20­35 % sequence identity with bacterial and other eukaryotic enzymes that have been shown to display 6PGL activity, Tb6PGL displays significant sequence similarities (22­25% identity) to glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase enzymes, also known as the NagB gene products (EC 3.5.99.6, formerly known as glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase, EC 5.3.1.10). These enzymes also share similar substrates, since NagB converts glucosamine 6-phosphate into fructose 6-phosphate and NH3 (see Fig. 1b). Sequence alignments of 6PGL enzymes have shown that they share ten strictly conserved residues (corresponding to G44, G45, D75, R77, H165, S168, F170, R200, G220, and K223 in Tb6PGL), to which an aspartate residue can be added (D163 in Tb6PGL), because it is replaced by the very similar glutamate residue in only a few 6PGL sequences.

Residues in bold, not conserved between lactonase and NagB enzymes, define the lactonase signature.

This leads to a total of 11 conserved residues. Among them, sequence alignments of 6PGL and NagB enzymes have shown that six residues are common to both families, while the five other conserved residues of 6PGL enzymes are substituted by amino acids with different physical and chemical properties in the NagB family. These latter define the lactonase signature. These earlier results are summarized in Table 1 in the case of Tb6PGL and Escherichia coli NagB (EcoNagB).6 Earlier, we determined the crystal structure of Tb6PGL at 2.1 Å resolution, which is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession number 2J0E. Other structures of the 6PGL family have been deposited in the PDB (1PBT, and 1VL1 from Thermotoga maritima, 1Y89 from Vibrio cholerae, 3CSS from Leishmania guyanensis, and 3CH7 from Leishmania braziliensis). Besides, several free and bound crystal structures are available in the NagB family, in particular for human (PDB entry 1NE7), Bacillus subtilis (2BKV and 2BKX entries), and E. coli (PDB entries 1DEA, 1FS6, 1FSF, 1FS5, 1HOR, 1HOT), sharing 24%, 23%, and 22% sequence identity, respectively, with Tb6PGL. The average backbone rmsd between Tb6PGL structure and the other available 6PGL structures is 1.9 Å, and 2.1 Å compared to NagB structures. Sequence alignments, NMR interaction studies and three-dimensional (3D) structure analysis, allowed us to propose key active site residues for 6PGL enzymes.6 However, a structure in complex with a substrate analogue, or with the reaction product had not been obtained at that time. Therefore, in order to get insight into the enzyme mechanism, docking studies with the lactone into the apo enzyme were undertaken and showed that the natural substrate could adopt two main orientations in the active site. In the first one, the phosphate group of the lactone is pointing towards K223 at the entrance of the active site. In the second one, the lactone is rotated globally by 180°, and the phosphate group points towards R200 and R77 at the bottom of the active site. This led us to propose two possible catalytic mechanisms, although we were aware that it is sometimes tricky to derive a mechanism from such static structures. In the first orientation, H165, activated by D163, would provide an acidic catalysis for the lactone ring opening, and the subsequent carboxylate group would be stabilized by R200 and R77. In the second orientation, the phosphate group lies deep inside the pocket, and the guanidinium group of R77 would ensure the acidic catalysis. According to the docking results, the position of the lactone in this orientation was not compatible with

activation by H165 because this residue was too far from C1, O1 and O5 of the lactone group (see Fig. 1c for atom labels), but it could still participate in substrate binding. In this orientation, K223 would stabilize the resulting carboxylate group after ring opening. In order to improve the understanding of the enzyme's catalytic mechanism and distinguish between the alternative proposals, we determined the structure of Tb6PGL in complex with 6PGA and with citrate, and we undertook molecular dynamics

Two proline residues (P37 and P196) out of 16 are observed in the cis conformation. The global fold of the enzyme belongs to the / structural family, as described.6 The 6PGA complex diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution (PDB entry 3E7F), while the citrate complex diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution (PDB entry 3EB9). Both complexes belong to space group P21. Table 2 shows statistics for both data sets. As in the case of apo Tb6PGL, in both 6PGA and citrate complexes there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a pure translation. It has been shown that the non-crystallographic dimer has no biological relevance, and that the protein is

probably a monomer in solution.6 A strong peak in the electron density is observed at the protein surface of each monomer, and corresponds to a zinc ion, as in the apo Tb6PGL structure 2J0E. The divalent ion, which is postulated to have a structural role rather than a catalytic one, lies at the center of a tetrahedron. The side chains of H56 and H97 are found at a distance of 2.0 Å from the metal ion, while the oxygen atom of the carboxylic side chain of D98 coordinates the zinc ion in a monodentate manner. The fourth ligand, which was assigned to a water molecule in the apo structure 2J0E, has clearly been identified for both complexes as the side chain of H236 of a non-crystallographic related molecule. A water molecule is found as a fifth ligand at 2.7 Å from the metal ion.

Comparison of the apo, 6PGA-bound and citrate-bound 6PGL crystal structures The structure of Tb6PGL-6PGA complex has an rmsd of 0.17 Å with that of Tb6PGL-citrate complex and of 0.45 Å with 2J0E. The structure of the Tb6PGL-citrate complex has an rmsd of 0.44 Å with 2J0E. The structures of the two complexes and of the apo form of Tb6PGL can therefore be considered as almost identical. The main differences in rmsd between the apo and the holo forms of the protein are located in loops and termini regions. The enzyme active site does not show significant structural changes upon ligand binding, and the two ligands sit in the catalytic binding site in very similar manners (Fig. 2). The Fo ­ Fc electron density map of the 6PGA complex calculated with the final model (without the ligand included) allowed to place the ligand in the active site (Fig. 2a). Figure 2b presents the 2mFobs ­ Fcalc map contoured at 2 , where the phosphate group, expected to present a stronger peak than the carboxylate group, points toward R200. The phosphate density is maintained using higher contouring up to 3 , whereas no density is visible for the carboxylate group until contouring lower than 1.3 . Figure 2c presents the OMIT map contoured at 0.7 

in stereo, in order to show the shape of the electron density around the ligand, unbiased by the model. Taken together, these data confirm that the 6PGA molecule has been modeled correctly and that there is no ambiguity about its orientation. The phosphate group of 6PGA and one of the three carboxylate groups of citrate lie at the same position and interact with R77 and R200. The carboxylate group of 6PGA interacts with the backbone atoms of G44 and G45 rather than with the side chain of K223, which is consistent with previous Tb6PGL-6PGA NMR interaction studies in solution, where the amide protons of G44 and G45 were found to display strong chemical shift perturbation upon 6PGA binding.6 A second carboxylate group of the citrate molecule, which is smaller than the natural substrate of the enzyme, is also visible in the OMIT map contoured at 1  but the central carbon atoms and hydroxyl atom of the citrate are not (see Fig. 2d). Molecular simulations For all simulations, we used chain A of the Tb6PGL-6PGA complex (PDB entry 3E7F) to generate structures in which 6PGA was removed to generate an empty structure, or in which 6PGA was replaced by the lactone to generate an enzyme­

For residues R77 and R200, the distances separating the two nitrogen atoms of the guanidinium group from the lactone atoms (O1, O5 or P) were calculated, but only the shortest of these two distances is reported.

substrate structure (see Materials and Methods for a detailed description). The empty equilibrated Tb6PGL structure was used as the initial structure in four independent 5 ns MD simulations. The rmsd values with respect to the initial structure are in the range of 2.5 Å (Fig. 3a), which might appear slightly high, but they remain in an expected range for a stable protein with 41% of its residues situated in loop regions. The mean deviation by residue, with respect to the initial structure, remains low along the protein sequence for residues belonging to secondary structure elements (typically smaller than 1.5 Å), and for residues of the active site. Larger deviations are observed only in surface loops and at the N- and Ctermini (Fig. 3b). As mentioned in Materials and Methods, the zinc ion, maintained by residues H65, H97 and D98, was removed from the structure for the MD simulations. However, the mean fluctuations observed over the simulations, for the distance separating the C atoms of these residues, remain under 1 Å. This indicates that residues involved in zinc coordination stay at close relative positions over the simulations, even in the absence of zinc. We did not observe any structural instability in this region that could have perturbed the overall structure. Taken together, these results show that the overall structure of Tb6PGL is stable. In the case of the Tb6PGL­lactone complex, the 6PGA molecule bound to chain A in the Tb6PGL6PGA complex (PDB entry 3E7F) was replaced by the lactone molecule, the phosphate groups of these two ligands being superimposed. In order to generate a more stable complex, the equilibration procedure described in Materials and Methods was repeated three times independently, using different seeds. Since they lead to three very similar complexes, one of them, shown in Fig. 3c, was chosen and further used in the simulations. In this structure, the lactone group (C1, O1 and O5 atoms, see Fig. 1c for atom labels) is close to the H165 side chain, but the phosphate group remains close to that of 6PGA in the crystal structure, and is maintained by the

guanidinium groups of R77 and R200. Starting from this complex, five independent 5 ns MD production runs (A, B, C, D, and E) using different seeds were performed using the same protocol as that used for the empty Tb6PGL structure. The Tb6PGL­lactone complex structure appears to be stable, the observed deviations with respect to the initial structure, or the mean deviation per residue with respect to the initial structure, being in the same range as for the empty structure (Fig. 3a and b). In order to get a more detailed picture of the catalytic mechanism, key inter-atomic mean distances separating the lactone and potential catalytic residues are given in Table 3. We followed the distances separating the O5 and O1 lactone atoms from the HD1 and HE2 atoms of H165 (see Fig. 1c and d for atom labels), and from the guanidinium groups of R77 and R200. The simulations indicate that in all cases R77 and R200 remain too far from the lactone group to be involved in the catalytic mechanism, but that they participate to substrate binding by interacting with the phosphate group. In contrast, the H165 side chain is closer to the lactone group, and may have a catalytic role. Although the distances separating the HE2-O1, HE2-O5, HD1-O1 and HD1-O5 atoms vary between trajectories, within a given trajectory the HE2 proton of H165 remains closer to the O1 and O5 atoms than the HD1 proton does. These results suggest that proton transfer between H165 and the lactone group is likely to involve the HE2 proton. However, in all trajectories, HE2 remains somewhat too far from O1 and O5 to allow activation by a direct proton transfer mechanism, which would imply a distance in the range of hydrogen bonds, i.e. less than 3 Å. To illustrate this point, we evaluated the percentage of time, over the total length of the dynamic trajectories, during which a hydrogen bond can be formed between HD1 or HE2 of H165 and O1 or O5 of the lactone. As shown in Table 4, such direct hydrogen bonds formed only a few times during the MD simulation. In that context, we tried to test if the proton transfer could be mediated by a water molecule. We

1017 in this MD study (Fig. 3c) represents a more reliable prediction than the docked complex. Indeed, although docking programs often achieve a prediction of the overall binding mode of a ligand, deviations with respect to the experimental structure are frequently in the range 2­3 Å, and the docking solution with the best score is not always the closest to the experimental structure.7 Therefore, it is not always possible to rely on docked complexes to provide a fine analysis of the protein­ ligand interactions, which is necessary to try and elucidate an enzymatic mechanism. In this context, an alternative and complementary method is to undertake MD simulations. For example, previous studies on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase have shown that MD simulations improved docking predictions, leading to a binding mode with the lowest predicted energy that had the lowest rmsd with respect to the known crystal structure.8 In particular, these simulations are performed in explicit water, which is an improvement with respect to the docking approach. In our case, we believe that the MD simulations also generated a more reliable Tb6PGL­lactone complex. At this point, it is interesting to critically discuss the catalytic mechanism proposed in this study. H165 is a conserved residue in the lactonase family, but this residue is conserved also in the NagB enzymes. The catalytic mechanism of these enzymes has been elucidated:9 in the first step, ring opening of the substrate is catalyzed by proton transfer from H143 in EcoNagB (equivalent to H165 in Tb6PGL), which is a reaction very similar to that of the lactone ring opening catalyzed by 6PGL enzymes. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the Tb6PGL-6PGA complex suggests that the lactone is rotated by about 180° in its active site, with respect to the orientation of the natural substrate of NagB enzymes, the phosphate group of the ligand being inverted from the entrance (in NagB) to the bottom (in 6PGL) of the pocket (Fig. 4a and b). For example, in the 1HOR structure of EcoNagB in complex with the competitive inhibitor 2-deoxy-2-amino glucitol6-phosphate (AGP), the phosphate group of the inhibitor is bound by K208 and R172, and these residues are therefore expected to bind to the phosphate group of glucosamine 6-phosphate, its natural substrate (Fig. 4a and b). The same is true for the 2BKX BsuNagB structure in complex with fructose 6-phosphate (Fig. 4c), where K202 and R167 are equivalent to K208 and R172 in EcoNagB. R172 in EcoNagB (or R167 in BsuNagB) is conserved in the deaminase family but it is absent from 6PGL enzymes: it belongs to the so-called lid region, a loop that has no sequence equivalent in 6PGL sequences. Conversely, R77 and R200 in Tb6PGL belong to the lactonase signature, and these residues are not conserved in NagB enzymes (Table 1). These two observations probably explain why, although their substrates and their active sites are overall similar, 6PGL and NagB enzymes do not share the same binding modes. Our results show that the orientation of the 6PGL substrate is different from that

evaluated the percentage of time, over the total length of each simulation, during which a water molecule was at proximity of the HD1 and HE2 protons of H165, or of O1 and O5 of the lactone, as shown in Table 4. We found that this percentage of time is always significantly lower for the HD1 proton than for the HE2 proton, and that the presence of water is only probable at the proximity of HE2. This is consistent with an activation role by HE2. In all trajectories but one, the presence of water molecules is observed both near O1 and O5 of the lactone, and we considered that the presence of water molecules at the proximity of both atoms was a probable event. Furthermore, we evaluated the percentage of time during which a water molecule can form a bridge between HE2 or HD1 and O1 or O5 (Table 5). In four trajectories, our results show that the formation of a water bridge between HE2 and O1 or O5 is plausible. This is not the case in one of the trajectories, mainly because in this trajectory, no water molecule is found near O1 and O5 of the lactone, a situation for which no clear explanation could be found. Taken together, our results tend to show that ring opening of the lactone involves proton transfer from HE2 of H165 to O1 or O5 of the lactone, via a water molecule. However, they do not allow clear discrimination between activation via proton transfer to O1 or to O5. They also suggest that R77 and R200, two residues that belong to the lactonase signature, are involved only in phosphate binding.

Discussion
The crystal structure of the Tb6PGL-6PGA complex allowed us to discriminate between the two possible orientations described for the lactone in earlier work.6 The MD simulations indicate that, in this orientation, H165 is the catalytic residue, while R77 and R200 bind to the phosphate group. Conversely, in a similar orientation, former docking results were compatible with a catalytic role for R77 or R200 and a binding role for H165. This apparent contradiction is due to the fact that the detailed lactone positions are different in the docked complex and the simulated complex in the present study, leading to different position of C1, O1 and O5 of the lactone group within the active site. The model for the Tb6PGL­lactone complex generated

proposed on the basis of sequence analysis alone,10 although such an orientation had been anticipated by other authors based on the comparison of the active sites of Thermotoga maritima 6PGL and of Bacillus subtilis NagB.11 These authors proposed that the two arginine side chains present at the bottom of the site in Tma6PGL (and belonging to the lactonase signature) would probably lead to a different orientation of the ligand in 6PGL enzymes. Interestingly, the MD simulations indicate that even if their ligand binding modes are different, the catalytic mechanism of 6PGL enzymes and that of the first step of NagB enzymes are similar. H165 of Tb6PGL, equivalent to H143 of EcoNagB, is activated by D163 of Tb6PGL, equivalent to D161 of EcoNagB, these two residues playing the role of a proton-relay system towards the substrate. In principle, the HE2 proton of H165 can be transferred either to O5 or O1 of the lactone. In the case of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase, protonation via the ring oxygen atom O5 has been observed,12 whereas for NagB proteins, the accepted mechanism involves protonation of the O1 atom.9 Our data cannot discriminate between these two possibilities in the case of 6PGL enzymes. In a more general framework, crystal structure data of binary complexes alone obviously help to identify the active site, but do not always allow the elucidation of a detailed catalytic mechanism for an

enzyme, because complexes with the natural substrate cannot always be obtained. One then has to resort to inhibitors that may or may not be completely relevant to the natural substrate's binding mode. Docking of the natural substrate in the active site can provide a static and somewhat qualitative picture of the enzyme­substrate interaction, sometimes leading to different plausible enzyme mechanisms. The work described here shows that information obtained by MD simulations provides a complementary picture of the protein­ ligand interactions that can help to discriminate between these catalytic scenarios.

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection The recombinant protein Tb6PGL was purified to 95% homogeneity in a single step with an NTA column that makes use of the N-terminal His-tag, as described.5 It was then concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl using Centricons (Amicon). Crystallization was achieved with the hanging-drop method, with a reservoir solution of 30% (w/v) PEG MME 2000, 50 mM sodium acetate and 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5. Soaking experiments aimed at locating inhibitors in the active site were undertaken: native crystals were soaked three times for 24 h in a fresh solution made of the

1020
reservoir solution (30% PEG MME 2000, 50 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM 6PGA or citrate. Tb6PGL-6PGA and Tb6PGL-citrate complexes data sets were collected at beamline ID14-EH3 (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The 6PGA complex diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution, while the citrate complex diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution. Both complexes belong to space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. All diffraction data were processed using XDS.13 Structure determination The structures of both complexes were solved using the molecular replacement technique. The model used was 2J0E, in which water molecules are omitted. The correct orientation and translation of the molecule within the crystallographic unit cell was determined with standard Patterson techniques as implemented in the MOLREP program. 14 The refinement was carried out using REFMAC5,15 with isotropic B-factors, but metal ion Bfactors were refined taking anisotropy into account. Between the refinement cycles, the models were subjected to manual rebuilding with the program COOT.16 The same program was used to model ligands with CIF library files obtained using HiC-UP and PRODRG websites. The OMIT map was calculated by SFCHECK in CCP4.17 Water molecules wwere added by the standard procedure with the ARP/warp suite.18 The stereochemical quality of the refined models was assessed using the program Procheck.19 Refinement statistics for both complexes are given in Table 2. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations The system consisted of chain A of the Tb6PGL-6PGA complex (PDB entry 3E7F) in which the 6PGA molecule was removed and the surrounding crystallographic water molecules were kept. The zinc ion was removed, because it is situated at the surface of the protein, far from the active site, and because it has been shown that its absence had no impact on the enzyme activity.6 In the active site, the side chains of residues R200, R77, and H164 were protonated, while D75 and D163 were in their aspartate form. The system was immersed in an octahedral solvent box with a cutoff at 10 Å of the protein surface, filled with TIP3P water molecules,20 and neutralized by addition of eight sodium counter ions. The program Amber 9.0§ has been used with the modified force field parm9921,22 to perform MD simulations. The periodic boundary simulation based on the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method23­26 controlled the long-range electrostatic energy with a cutoff of 9 Å. The Shake algorithm27,28 fixed all the bond lengths involving hydrogen atoms of the protein, the ligand and TIP3P waters, with an integration time step of 2 fs. The Berendsen thermostat29 maintained temperature by coupling the protein and the ligand to an external heat-bath fixed at the desired temperature. The ligand parameters (bonds force constants and partial atomic charges) were estimated with the GAFF force field, 30 and the antechamber programs,31 from the Amber suite of programs.  http://xray.bmc.uu.se/hicup/  http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/prodrg/ § http://amber.scripps.edu

Insights Into the Catalytic Mechanism of 6PGL Enzymes

In the minimization step, the steepest descent algorithm was used to minimize the energy of the water molecules, while a harmonic positional restraint potential (weight 50 kcal.mol-1 Å -2) was applied on the protein and on the ligand atoms. During the heating and equilibration procedure, the system was first heated to 300 K over 10 ps at constant volume, then it was kept at constant pressure for 10 ps before the progressive removal of the restraints fixed on the protein and on the ligand over 100 ps. The equilibrated complex was used in MD simulations at 300 K and constant volume, for 5 ns production runs. In the case of the Tb6PGL­lactone complex, the system was identical with that used to generate the empty Tb6PGL structure, but the 6PGA molecule was replaced by a lactone molecule whose phosphate group was superimposed to that of 6PGA in the 3E7F structure (Fig. 3c). In order to generate an energetically more favorable complex, we used an equilibration procedure identical with that described above for the empty Tb6PGL protein. An equilibrated complex was used for 5 ns MD simulations at 300 K at constant volume using the same conditions as those used for the apo Tb6PGL protein. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The two structures of Tb6PGL in complex with 6PGA and with citrate have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 3E7F and 3EB9, respectively.
