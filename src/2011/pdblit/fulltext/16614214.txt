Atomic Description of an Enzyme Reaction Dominated by Proton Tunneling
Laura Masgrau,1,2* Anna Roujeinikova,1,3 Linus O. Johannissen,1,2 Parvinder Hothi,1,3 Jaswir Basran,4 Kara E. Ranaghan,5 Adrian J. Mulholland,5 Michael J. Sutcliffe,1,2 Nigel S. Scrutton,1,3 David Leys1,3 We present an atomic-level description of the reaction chemistry of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction dominated by proton tunneling. By solving structures of reaction intermediates at near-atomic resolution, we have identified the reaction pathway for tryptamine oxidation by aromatic amine dehydrogenase. Combining experiment and computer simulation, we show proton transfer occurs predominantly to oxygen O2 of Asp128b in a reaction dominated by tunneling over È0.6 angstroms. The role of long-range coupled motions in promoting tunneling is controversial. We show that, in this enzyme system, tunneling is promoted by a short-range motion modulating proton-acceptor distance and no long-range coupled motion is required. he physical basis of the catalytic power of enzymes remains contentious despite sustained and intensive research efforts (1­3). The question of whether enzymes have evolved to use quantum tunneling to the best advantage has provoked a heated debate (4­10). That tunneling occurs is now widely accepted, with conceptual frameworks incorporating protein motion into the enzymic H tunneling process (11­14). More controversial is a role for compressive motion to promote H tunneling (4), a special property of enzymes that might be endowed by evolutionary pressure. Whereas some studies have suggested a role for protein motion in facilitating tunneling (15­22), others have argued that motions that contribute to tunneling are similar in both enzymes and free solution and therefore that the degree of tunneling available in the enzyme system is equivalent to that in free solution (5­8, 10). A number of kinetic studies (23­31) are in agreement with environmentally coupled models of H tunneling (11, 29, 32­34), but atomic-level insight into the tunneling event can only be obtained from high-resolution protein structures of catalytically competent intermediates combined with computer simulation (35). The quinoprotein enzymes, the mechanisms of which are generally well understood (36), are ideally suited to studies of H transfer during substrate oxidation (14) and are thus excellent

model systems for investigating H transfer by nuclear tunneling. Aromatic amine dehydrogenase (AADH) is a tryptophan tryptophyl quinone (TTQ)­dependent quinoprotein (37, 38) and catalyzes H transfer by quantum mechanical tunneling (24). It oxidatively deaminates aromatic primary amines to form the corresponding aldehyde (Fig. 1); the electrons released are transferred from AADH to the type I blue copper protein azurin and enter the respiratory chain via a c-type cytochrome. We present here an analysis of the oxidative deamination of tryptamine by AADH using a combination of

x-ray crystallography and computational and kinetic studies. This has provided a detailed description of the overall reaction pathway and in particular the H-tunneling step. Crystal structures of key intermediates. The crystal structure of substrate-free AADH ° was determined at a resolution of 1.2 A (x-ray exposure reduces the TTQ cofactor to the semiquinone form within the first seconds of data collection, as observed by color change) (39). The a2b2 heterotetramer (a molecular mass, 40 kD, and TTQ-containing b, 12 kD) is highly similar in fold to the related TTQ-dependent methylamine dehydrogenase (Fig. 1). The carboxylate of Asp128b, the proton acceptor in the tunneling step, is in close proximity to and almost perpendicular to the plane of the quinone system. O1 of this carboxylate (Fig. 2) hydrogen ° bonds to the backbone amide of Trp160b (3.0 A) and a partially occupied (È50% present) water ° molecule (2.7 A), and O2 is in close proximity to ° Thr172b hydroxyl (3.4 A). Crystal structures of tryptamine-AADH intermediate complexes in the reductive halfreaction (Fig. 2C) were obtained by soaking crystals with substrate and flash-cooling either before, immediately after, or several minutes after complete reduction of the TTQ was observed by visible inspection of the crystals (39). Alternatively, crystals of tryptamine-AADH intermediate complexes were prepared by cocrystallization under anaerobic conditions, leading to different space groups (39). The high resolution routinely obtained (ranging from 1.6 to

RESEARCH ARTICLES
° 1.1 A) allowed unambiguous identification of the intermediates present by inspection of the difference Fourier electron density maps (identification by microspectrophotometry was not possible, because intermediates after TTQ reduction do not absorb in the visible region). Only data sets consistent with a single intermediate present at high occupancy levels in the active site were used for model building and refinement. Key intermediates were observed in both active sites within the asymmetric unit and in distinct space groups, indicating the reaction path is largely independent of crystal packing. The Michaelis complex (intermediate I, Fig. 2) was too short-lived to be observed. However, the crystal structure of the reduced enzyme in complex with tryptamine (I) reveals the indole moiety of the substrate sandwiched between the side chain of Phe97a and the Gly178a­Leu179a peptide bond, in a position that is occupied by the Leu179a side chain in other structures (Fig. 2B). Structures of substrate-oxidized AADH complexes obtained at lower resolution by soaking at pH G 5.0 reveal a similar structure. The amine group of the substrate contacts (Fig. 2B) the carbonyl backbone oxygen of Asn156b ° ° ° (2.9 A), Asp84b (3.1 A), and Val158b (3.0 A); ° the amino group of the aminoquinol (2.9 A); and a water molecule located close to Asp128b ° O1 (3.2 A). Assuming this structure is a good model for intermediate I, we postulate that, upon formation of the Michaelis complex, Asp128b O1 deprotonates the substrate via a bridging water molecule, initiating attack of the nucleophilic nitrogen on the TTQ O6­C6 bond and leading to formation of a transient carbinolamine intermediate (II). The next step likely involves departure of the hydroxyl group via Asp128b acid catalysis, leading to formation of the first Schiff base (or iminoquinone, III) intermediate of the catalytic cycle and ensuring that Asp128b is deprotonated (Fig. 2A). We were unable to obtain structural data for this AADHiminoquinone complex, which formed before the proton transfer (i.e., quantum tunneling) step. However, an analogous complex with the inhibitor phenylhydrazine (containing a phenyl rather than indole side chain) has been characterized in solution (37). In the crystal structure, the only notable changes from intermediate I are a slight rotation of the TTQ away from the carboxylate group of Asp128b (Fig. 2B) and the concomitant minor repositioning of the side chain of Thr172b, which now forms ° a hydrogen bond with Asp128b O2 (3.0 A). The phenylhydrazine nitrogen, which mimics the iminoquinone-reactive C1 donor atom in the catalytic cycle, is within hydrogen-bonding ° distance of Asp128b O1 (2.8 A) and in van der ° Waals contact with Asp128b O2 (3.2 A). In principle, either Asp128b oxygen could be a proton acceptor for the H-tunneling reaction, leading to two distinct possible intermediates (IV). We were unable to trap the proposed intermediate (IV) formed immediately after the tunneling event, in which the C10N bond is expected to be coplanar with the modified indole of Trp109b and the proton residing on either O1 or O2. The electron density obtained for crystals flash-cooled immediately after reduction (as identified by color change) is consistent with movement of the C10N bond out of plane by È60- to give the enzyme species (V) after proton transfer. This geometry increases the distance between C1 and Asp128b O1 and O2 to ° ° 3.7 A and 4.1 A, respectively. No evidence for protonation of Asp128b was observed from the ° 1.1 A electron density map, and from the structure it is clear that the enzyme is not configured to stabilize the negative charge on O7 of the TTQ cofactor by hydrogen bonding (i.e., there is no oxyanion hole). We infer that, in the crystal structure of intermediate V, O7 is protonated

by proton transfer from Asp128b via the nitrogen Schiff base in a two-step process. This is consistent with combined quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) dynamics simulations, where planarity in intermediate IV is lost after proton transfer to form intermediate V. This step substantially increases the C1­ acceptor distances and effectively ensures irreversibility of the H-tunneling step. Our calculations show that the deprotonated Asp128b (V) is stabilized substantially (by È18 kcal mol­1) relative to the protonated form by electrostatic interactions with Trp160b HN and Thr172b hydroxyl and that deprotonation of either O1 or O2 by the neutral Schiff base nitrogen could occur after rotation around the N­C6 bond. Although the conformation required for proton transfer from O2 to N is highly similar to that observed in the structure of V, efficient proton transfer from O1 requires the N­C6 torsion angle to increase from the observed value of È60- to beyond È90-. The latter process would require substantial repositioning of the main chain of Asp84b to avoid a steric clash with the C1 atom, a dynamic process for which no evidence was found in the obtained crystal structures. Regardless, formation of intermediate V allows for both species of IV, either O1 or O2 protonated, to converge to a single intermediate and poises the enzyme for the subsequent hydrolysis steps. The increased C1­Asp128b distance after formation of V allows for positioning of a water molecule between C1 and O1 (intermediate VI). Transfer of a water molecule from bulk solution to the postulated position in VI requires transient but substantial repositioning of the indole group, which is likely to be hindered within the crystal. Stereospecific attack by this water molecule forms a carbinolamine (VII) containing a chiral center at C1. Analysis of crystals soaked for 5 to 10 min after TTQ reduction reveals electron density that clearly corresponds to intermediate VII in an S enantiomeric configuration, consistent with activation of the water molecule by Asp128b O1 leading to attack of the si face of the C10N bond. Despite the inherent instability of carbinolamines in water, intermediate VII is stable under anaerobic conditions for several days, as revealed by crystal structures obtained from cocrystallization under anaerobic conditions. We conclude that Asp128b is unable to catalyze C1­N bond breakage by proton abstraction from the hydroxyl of the carbinolamine by O1 and concomitant proton donation to the leaving NH group by O2, because O1 rather than O2 abstracts a proton from the attacking water molecule. In principle, indirect deprotonation of O1 by O2 via the TTQ nitrogen is possible, a process that requires active site motions similar to those invoked for transferring the proton of O1 to N and ultimately to O7 in the step from IV to V. However, this motion does not occur to any significant extent, as indicated by the stability of intermediate VII in the crystals and by mass spectrometric analysis of enzyme incubated with b-substituted aromatic amine substrates, which reveals the presence of a covalent adduct consistent with formation of a stable intermediate VII in solution (39). In the case of the reduced AADH-tryptamine complex, the carbinolamine moiety is furthermore protected from water by both enzyme and substrate aromatic groups. After oxidation of the enzyme, we postulate that hydrolysis of the carbinolamine is facilitated by creation of a good leaving group (i.e., the aminoquinone) and the possible introduction of a water molecule between Asp128b O2 and the aminoquinone (intermediate VIII). Computational analysis of the H-tunneling step (III to IV). To investigate in atomic detail the proton transfer step that leads to intermediate IV, we performed computational simulation studies (39). On the basis of the proton-acceptor distances in the modeled complex III structure ° ° [d(O1­H1) 0 1.74 A and d(O2­H1) 0 2.67 A, respectively] and in accord with the analogous AADH-phenylhydrazine structure described above, we inferred that the transfer of H1 could occur to either O1 or O2 of Asp128b. Therefore, we have studied both transfers. With use of a combined QM/MM potential (40), we first calculated the free energy of activation for the classical transfer of the proton to O1 and O2 at 300 K (DG-,classical) (41). This magnitude was then corrected to account for H tunneling (DG-,tunneling), which results in the phenomenological free energy of activation (11) at 300 K [DG act(300) 0 DG -,classical(300) þ DG -,tunneling(300)], from which we estimate the rate constant according to kðTÞ 0 kB T expEjDGact ðT Þ=RT^ h DG-,classical 0 18.1 kcal mol­1 for O2) and classical thermodynamically (DGreaction 0 4.8 kcal mol­1 classical for O1 and DGreaction 0 ­7.8 kcal mol­1 for O2). Breakage of the polarized C­H bond in the AADH:tryptamine adduct is aided by the cationic nature of the iminoquinone and the elevated pKa [7.1 in free enzyme and 6.0 in the enzyme-substrate complex (44)] of Asp128b. The product is stabilized partly by delocalization of the developing negative charge onto the TTQ and partly by hydrogen bonds with the enzyme. The inclusion of H tunneling reduces both barriers by a substantial yet similar amount (DG-,tunneling 0 ­4.6 kcal mol­1 for O1 and DG-,tunneling 0 ­4.9 kcal mol­1 for O2), thus not altering the preference for transfer to O2. The experimentally deduced free energy of activation [È12.7 kcal mol­1 and k(300) È 3500 sj1] therefore agrees well with that calculated for transfer to O2 [13.2 kcal mol­1 and k(300) 0 1500 sj1] but less well for the much slower transfer to O1 [15.4 kcal mol­1 and k(300) 0 38 sj1]. As indicated by this DG-,tunneling and irrespective of the acceptor oxygen considered, our calculations demonstrate a large H-tunneling component in this proton-transfer step [the catalytic contribution of tunneling cannot be calculated directly here, because this requires comparison with an appropriate reference system (3)]. From the calculated transmission factor (11), k, we estimate that in excess of 99.9% of the reaction proceeds via tunneling (i.e., tunneling increases the rate by three orders of magnitude). This suggests that, in the absence of tunneling, C­H bond cleavage (È1 sj1) rather than the oxidative half-reaction (45) would be rate limiting in the overall catalytic cycle, emphasizing the critical role of tunneling in this enzyme system. The effect is less pronounced for the deuterated substrate (DG-,tunneling 0 3.3 kcal mol­1 for O1 and DG-,tunneling 0 3.3 kcal mol­1 for O2), resulting in calculated KIEs (42 for O1 and 93 for O2) elevated substantially beyond the semiclassical results (5.0 for O1 and 5.8 for O2, i.e., when no tunneling is considered) and in agreement with the large experimentally observed value (55 T 6) (Fig. 3A). Our analysis of tunneling in AADH using computational methods is consistent with our experimental kinetic data obtained by using stopped-flow methods (Fig. 3A and table S1) (39). We used dideuterated tryptamine in our kinetic studies. Although secondary KIEs can make substantial contributions to observed KIEs and therefore affect their interpretation, they will have negligible effect in this case, given the highly inflated value of the observed KIE (55 T 6). A predicted upper value for the secondary KIE is 1.15 for reactions involving a change in hybridization (sp3 to sp2) (46), although this might be elevated slightly if there is coupled motion between the primary and a-secondary hydrogens (47). Both the

where T is temperature, kB is Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant, and R is the gas constant. The term DG-,tunneling was calculated from the transmission coefficient (k), often written in the literature (11, 42) as a preexponential factor multiplying the classical rate constant, obtained from variational transitionstate theory with small curvature tunneling corrections (32, 42) calculations [DG-,tunneling 0 ­RT ln(k)]. We have limited our study to a single temperature (T 0 300 K) because, although the first microscopic simulations of the temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) for enzymic reactions have been presented recently (7, 34, 43) and are encouraging, they also reflect the difficulties and complexities of addressing this issue computationally. Despite the shorter initial O1­H1 distance, our simulations show an energetic preference for the transfer to O2 both kinetically (DG -,classical 0 20.0 kcal mol­1 for O1 and SCIENCE VOL 312

highly inflated KIE (d7) and the magnitude of the prefactor ratio (d1) derived from temperature analysis of reaction rates with protiated and deuterated tryptamine are consistent with H transfer by quantum mechanical tunneling. We infer this temperature-dependent H transfer indicates an environmental reorganization that serves to bring the H energy levels into resonance. The picture of the reaction emerging from our results is as follows: The reacting moieties first approach by classical activation to a H1­O1 ° ° and H1­O2 separation of È1.51 A and È1.64 A, respectively; before this point (Fig. 3, B and C), the reaction coordinate is dominated by heavy atom motions, especially for the transfer to O2. From this point [s 0 ­0.40 bohr amu½ for O1 and s 0­0.77 bohr amu½ for O2; the reaction coordinate, s, is the mass-weighted difference in position from the transition state (1 bohr 0 ° 0.529 A), with s 0 0 at the top of the barrier and negative at the reactant side], the proton tunnels ° ° a distance of È0.49 A and È0.59 A (for O1 and O2, respectively) through the barrier at a dominant tunneling energy of È8.7 kcal mol­1 (for O1) and È10.4 kcal mol­1 (for O2) below the top of the barrier; proton motion is highly dominant in this region of the reaction coordinate because the proton-donor bond breaks (and the proton tunnels) (Fig. 3, B and C). From the initial complex III structure, with H1 hydrogen bonded to O1, transfer to O2 requires more structural rearrangements to attain a configuration from which the proton can tunnel than does transfer to O1. However, inspection of the classical free energy profile reveals that early in the reaction, the H1­O2 average distance shortens ° to È2.0 A [i.e., more similar to d(O1­H1)] at a relatively low energetic cost (G2 kcal mol­1), in part by maintaining a short O1­H1 distance while shortening the O2­H1 distance. This shortening of the O2­H1 distance is accompanied by repositioning of the Asp128b carboxylate and rotation of the C1 methylene (Fig. 4). Although a recent study with lipoxygenase suggests that such a shortening of the protonacceptor distance decreases tunneling (48), it is generally associated with the promotion of tunneling (1). To investigate further protein motions and in particular those that could reduce the protonacceptor distance and thereby promote tunneling, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of our modeled complex III. These simulations also suggest that the O2­H1 distance, critical for tunneling, can be shortened by rotation of H1 toward O2 and repositioning of the Asp128b carboxylate; in particular, the motion of H1 is focused on modulating the O2­H1 distance (Fig. 4, A and B). The C1 and H1 spectral densities (21, 49) derived from the dynamics simulations share a common peak at È165 cmj1, the frequency of a short-range motion that reduces the proton-acceptor distance, predominantly through motion of H1 (Fig. 4, C and D). However, cross-correlation analysis suggests that the motion of H1 is not strongly coupled to O2 (fig. S1, A and B) or any other neighboring atom; this is further supported by principal component analysis of the covariance (table S2). The motion of O2 is (with the use of a low cutoff value of 0.5) only coupled to its hydrogen-bonding partner, Thr172b (fig. S1, C and D). In turn, the motion of Thr172b is additionally only coupled to Cys171b, which is not correlated with O2. Thus, our results show no network of coupled long-range motions that modulate the O2­H1 distance (50); modulation of the proton transfer distance in AADH involves only short-range motion.

Warshel and co-workers realized and demonstrated that an understanding of tunneling requires computer simulations. A recent analysis is presented in (6). Others have also made important contributions in this area, and these have been reviewed recently (2). 36. M. Mure, S. A. Mills, J. P. Klinman, Biochemistry 41, 9269 (2002). 37. S.
