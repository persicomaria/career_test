-Microseminoprotein (MSP) is a small cysteine-rich protein (molecular mass about 10 kDa) first isolated from human seminal plasma and later identified in several other organisms. The function of MSP is not known, but a recent study has shown MSP to bind CRISP-3, a protein present in neutrophilic granulocytes. The amino acid sequence is highly variable between species raising the question of the evolutionary conservation of the 3D structure. Here we present NMR solution structures of both the human and the porcine MSP. The two proteins (sequence identity 51%) have a very similar 3D structure with the secondary structure elements well conserved and with most of the amino acid substitutions causing a change of charge localized to one side of the molecule. MSP is a -sheet-rich protein with two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain is composed of a four-stranded sheet, with the strands arranged according to the Greek key-motif, and a less structured part. The C-terminal domain contains two two-stranded sheets with no resemblance to known structural motifs. The two domains, connected to each other by the peptide backbone, one disulfide bond, and interactions between the N and C termini, are oriented to give the molecule a rather extended structure. This global fold differs markedly from that of a previously published structure for porcine MSP, in which the two domains have an entirely different orientation to each other. The difference probably stems from a misinterpretation of ten specific inter-domain NOEs.

Introduction
-Microseminoprotein (MSP) is a hydrophilic, non-glycosylated, cysteine-rich protein with a molecular mass of around 10 kDa. It was first isolated from human seminal plasma.1 Human MSP (hMSP) is secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate gland2 giving rise to the alternative name prostatic secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94).3 The expression of MSP is, however, not limited to the

prostate gland4 and its number of amino acid residues varies between species. MSP proteins have been isolated and identified by amino acid sequencing from man,5,6 chicken,7 pig,8 rat,9 and ostrich.10 Gene and/or cDNA sequences have been obtained from man, 11 ­ 14 rhesus monkey, 13, 15 pig, 16 rat, 9 baboon, 17 cotton-top tamarin,18 and mouse.19 The amino acid sequences of the various MSPs do not suggest homology of MSP to any other protein in GenBank. Many functions of MSP have been suggested1,20­24 but none based on firm experimental evidence. The most promising observation that could lead to an understanding of the biology and function of MSP is the recent finding that hMSP binds to a protein in human blood (PSP94-binding protein)25 and to CRISP-3 from human leukocytes.26 Consequently, it is now possible to study the interaction of MSP with natural ligands motivating the determination of the three-dimensional structure of hMSP.

Numbering is according to the human sequence. Stars indicate the locations of the exon 2/exon 3 and exon 3/exon 4 boundaries, respectively, for the human protein. Gaps have been inserted in the pig, rat, mouse, chicken, and ostrich sequences to allow proper alignment of the sequences. Totally conserved residues are white on red background and those with similarity are in light red. The alignment was done with the Espript program54 at http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ using the default values.

A notable characteristic of MSP is that its amino acid sequence is highly variable between species (Figure 1). Except for the ten cysteine residues, only very few amino acid residues are totally conserved in all species that have been investigated.10 It would, therefore, be interesting to see how conserved the three-dimensional structure of MSP is between different species. Therefore, we have determined the structures of both human and porcine MSP. Porcine MSP (pMSP) was first isolated as a sperm motility inhibitor27 and later identified as MSP21 after its amino acid sequence became available.8 The porcine MSP is three amino acids shorter than hMSP and the sequence identity between the two proteins is 51%. During our work, a solution structure of pMSP was published.28 Although the secondary structure elements were practically identical to what we had found, the published structure showed a domain orientation of pMSP that differed considerably from that of our structure. The domain orientation that we observe for pMSP is almost identical to the one we observe for hMSP. Here we report our experimental NMR data and our calculated structures of human and porcine MSP together with a detailed comparison of our structures of the two MSPs. We also provide a probable explanation for the difference of our pMSP structure from that previously reported.

factor Xa cleavage site of the poly-His/S-protein tag and the N-terminal residue of the mature protein. This facilitated the efficient removal of the tag by factor Xa digestion. Preliminary experiments had shown that, at least for the porcine protein, the tag could not be removed when an extension was not present. In typical expressions, 27 and 49 mg of poly-His/ S-protein-tagged protein was obtained from one liter of culture for pMSP and hMSP, respectively. More than 50% of the protein was correctly folded according to analysis by RP-HPLC. Digestion of this material with activated factor X followed by RPHPLC purification yielded 7 and 15 mg of recombinant pMSP and hMSP, respectively, with more than 95% purity. Resonance assignment The sequential backbone assignment of recombinant MSP was made according to standard procedures using three-dimensional hetero-nuclear NMR spectra (HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, and HN(CO) CACB). Thanks to good signal dispersion and narrow lines almost complete backbone assignment was obtained for both proteins. The side-chain assignment was based on 3D 15N HSQC-TOCSY spectra in H2O/2H2O (90/10) as well as 2D TOCSY in 100% 2H2O. Also the side-chain assignment was close to complete. In total, 98% of the shifts were assigned for both proteins. The resonance assignment of native MSP was based on 2D-TOCSY and 2D-NOESY spectra, resulting in a 95% and 93% completeness of the backbone proton assignments for pMSP and hMSP, respectively. Structure calculation Initially, we used the program CNS and manually assigned NOESY cross-peaks that were integrated with the Sparky program and converted into upper distance restraints using some fixed distances as reference. An r -6 dependence of intensity on distance was assumed. In the final CNS calculations we used ca 1000 NOE restraints, 59 -angle restraints based on 3JHN-H coupling constants and 20 hydrogen bonds. We also used the S-S bond arrangement (2-47, 15-39, 34-70, 37-46 and 61-84) reported for pMSP by Wang et al.29 Our structures deviate in one obvious way from the structure of

Results
Protein production The dominating form (P1) of pMSP isolated from porcine seminal plasma,8 which is the native protein used in these studies, has an Asp residue in position 42 (GenBank accession no. S41663), whereas the only published cDNA sequence16 for pMSP (GenBank accession no. S80724) codes for an Asn residue. However, cloning of cDNA from porcine prostate tissue revealed two different cDNA sequences. One was identical to the published cDNA sequence while the second coded for the same protein but with Asp in position 42. Consequently, the second cDNA was used to construct the vector for the expression of recombinant pMSP. The recombinant MSPs were both expressed with a spacer of three extra glycine residues between the

504 pMSP published by Wang et al.28 and this is in the relative orientation of the two domains. In order to obtain another evaluation of the interpretation of the nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) we switched to the program CYANA and a fully automatic NOEpeak assignment. A first round of structure calculations in CYANA, using only unassigned NOESY cross-peaks and chemical shift information and for pMSP torsion angles obtained from spin couplings, resulted in reasonably well-defined families of structures for both proteins. According to the distances between the cysteine sulfur atoms (Table 1) the pairs of Cys residues in the disulfide bonds were unambiguously assigned as Cys2-Cys50, Cys18-Cys42, Cys37-Cys73, Cys40-Cys49, and Cys64-Cys87 (hMSP numbering). This arrangement is consistent with the disulfide pattern previously reported for pMSP.29 A second round of structure calculations in CYANA, where the NOE cross-peak lists, shift assignment lists, dihedral angle constraints, hydrogen bond constraints, and the disulfide bond arrangement were used, resulted in an ensemble of structures with an RMSD to the mean structure of 0.9(±0.2) Å for both proteins for the backbone atoms in the structured parts of the protein (residues 2­8, 18­93 for hMSP and residues 2­8, 14­90 for pMSP) for the ten models with the lowest target function values. The calculated structures emerging from these calculations showed that the two MSP proteins are, as expected, very similar and consist of two domains connected by a three amino acid residue linker. The difference between the structure of pMSP reported here and the one published by Wang et al.,28 however, remained. In order to refine the structure and to verify the relative orientation of the two domains, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) for N-H, N-CO and HNCO were measured and included in the input data to Xplor-NIH together with the torsion angles from TALOS and the NOE constraints from CYANA,

giving a total of 1557 and 1691 restraints, for hMSP and pMSP, respectively (Table 2, hMSP and pMSP, Set 1). A final set of 200 structures was calculated for each protein with Xplor-NIH including a Ramachandran potential. The ten structures with the lowest total energy were selected from each set to represent the solution structure at pH 6.0 and 37 °C of hMSP and pMSP, respectively (Figure 2). Apart from a nine amino acid residue loop region in the first domain of hMSP (residues Gly9-Lys17), the structures of the two proteins are well defined. The RMSD to the mean structure for the secondary structural elements are for hMSP 0.6(±0.1) Å and for pMSP 0.7(±0.2) Å for the backbone atoms and for both proteins 0.9(±0.2) Å for all heavy atoms. Structural statistics for the final ensemble of structures for each protein are given in Table 3. Validation The quality of the structure ensembles obtained was satisfying for both proteins according to the agreement with the experimental restraints and the quality scores calculated with the structure analysis

505 strands of the -sheet. In hMSP this loop may be divided into a first part (Glu8-Lys17) with a less well-defined structure and a second part (Cys18Ile28) with a better-defined structure. The first ten residues (Glu8-Lys17) have scarce NOE data information and the TALOS database was able to predict only two pairs of  and  angles (Val10 and Thr15) from the provided chemical shift data in this region. In the second part of the loop the two strands Cys18Asp20 and Asn24-His26 might form a regular antiparallel -sheet but the secondary structure calculation with MOLMOL only displayed this for one of the ten structures whereas RasMol found it in six of ten structures. For pMSP this loop (Gln8Leu25) is better defined and the antiparallel -sheet is found in most of the structures. The C-terminal domain contains two twostranded antiparallel -sheets (in hMSP Thr55Val57, Glu91-Ile93 and Cys64-Lys69, Lys74-Glu79) packed onto each other forming a more unusual motif and with a folding that causes the C terminus of the peptide chain to end up close to the N terminus. In the N-terminal domain, the aromatic rings of the residues Tyr3, Phe4, and Tyr43 (Gly in pMSP) are on the surface of the protein while His26 and Trp32, which are packed towards each other, are little exposed. In the C-terminal domain, the aromatic residues Tyr59 and Trp92 point towards the hydrophobic core of the domain while Phe68 (Leu in pMSP) and Tyr75 are packed towards each other and partially exposed.

The main part of the N-terminal domain is a fourstranded antiparallel -sheet with the four -strands (Tyr3-Pro6, Glu31-Thr34, Glu38-Cys42, Glu46-Thr51 in hMSP and Cys2-Pro6, Val28-Lys30, Glu35-Cys39, Ala43-Asn48 in pMSP) arranged in a Greek key-like motif.30 A rather long loop (Glu8-Ile28 in hMSP and Gln8-Leu25 in pMSP) connects the first and fourth

506 Comparison of native and recombinant proteins The recombinant proteins used in our studies both contain an N-terminal extension of three glycine residues that might affect the structure since there is a close contact between the N and C termini. To look for a possible effect from these extensions we have made the full sequencespecific assignment of the native, unlabelled proteins as well. Figure 3 summarizes the differences in the HN and H shifts between the native

and recombinant protein for hMSP and pMSP. As can be seen, the shift differences are in general small and localized where one would expect to find them if they were caused only by minor perturbations close to the N terminus. There are, however, also small differences in the H shifts of pMSP from residues Ala51, Ile52, and Pro53 that might indicate minor variations in the  and/or  angles of these residues. There are also some differences in the C terminus, confirming the close proximity of the two termini. We feel, however,

confident that the structures reported here are in general valid for the native MSPs even though there may be minor structural differences, especially in the N termini. Divergence from a previously published structure In order to find out the cause of the marked difference between our structure of pMSP and that of Wang et al.28 we repeated the structure calculations with CYANA and Xplor-NIH using the same protocol but with a set of restraints containing the ten inter-domain NOEs described by Wang et al.28 (Table 2, set 2). The structures obtained with set 2 were essentially identical to those reported by Wang et al.28 A comparison of our two structures for pMSP obtained with set 1 and set 2 are shown in Figure 4. The main difference between the two structures is in the relative orientation of the two domains. There is also a substantial difference within the N-terminal domain with an RMSD between them of 2.5 Å, whereas it is only 0.8 Å for the C-terminal domain. In our fully automatic, unrestricted NOE peak assignment process none of the inter-domain NOEs of Wang et al.28 were found. In fact, the shifts for three of the presumed inter-domain NOEs are outside the cut-off (0.03 ppm) used in the CYANA calculations. CYANA assigned seven of the presumed inter-domain NOEs to local interactions and the remaining three could manually be identified as local, see Table 4. In the structure calculations using Xplor-NIH the total energies for the ten best structures were significantly lower with restraint set 1 (-240(±15) kcal/mol) than with set 2 (145(±15) kcal/mol). This difference in energies is about equally divided between NOE, RDC and Ramachandran potential energies. The Ramachandran potential energy is caused by five residues (Asp17, Leu18, Lys19, Cys34, and Gln41) that are constantly in the

disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot in the structures calculated with restraint set 2. It is interesting to note that three of these five residues are those assumed to participate in the interdomain contact from the N-terminal domain (Asp17, Leu18, and Lys19), and a fourth (Cys34) forms a disulfide bond to the C-terminal domain. It appears as if the hairpin loop between strands  and  is forced into an unfavorable conformation and the loop between strand 2 and 3 has been pulled away from the rest of the -sheet. The Rfactors for the RDCs as calculated by Xplor-NIH do not differ very much with or without the interdomain NOEs for the N-H RDCs, whereas for the N-CO and HN-CO they are clearly better for the structures without the inter-domain restraints (Table 5), and very similar to the ones for hMSP. As seen from Table 5 it is not only the inter-domain orientation that affects the R-factors. In fact the Rfactors are worst for the N-terminal domain itself,

for restraint set 2. Four of the 18 HN-CO RDCs in the N-terminal domain are on the average violated by more than 7 H2. Three of these are Gln16, Leu18 and Val21 involved in (or close to) the inter-domain contact. It is thus clear that the structure with the inter-domain NOE restraints is not compatible with the set of the RDCs used here. It is also encouraging that the extended structure is in good agreement with our hMSP structure also reported here.

Discussion
MSP is a cysteine-rich protein implicating that production of a correctly folded recombinant protein might offer difficulties. Preliminary experiments showed, however, that after denaturation of native MSPs in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and with total reduction of the disulfide bonds, the protein could be refolded with a more than 90% yield to a structure indistinguishable from that of native MSPs according to RP-HPLC and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The recombinant MSPs used in this work also folded to a structure almost indistinguishable from that of the native protein according to 1H TOCSYNMR, except for some minor perturbations due to the three additional Gly residues at the N terminus (Figure 3). MSP has an amino acid sequence that is highly variable between species. All the ten cysteine residues but few other residues are conserved between species spanning primates and birds (Figure 1). Inspection of the MSP structure reveals that all cysteine residues, with the exception of Cys87 (Cys84 in pMSP), are located either within or at one of the ends of the strands in the -sheets and that this is also the case for most of the other conserved amino acid residues. The exceptions are Gly23 (Gly20 in pMSP) in the first loop in the Nterminal domain and Tyr59 (Tyr56 in pMSP) and Pro83 (Pro80 in pMSP) in the first and third loop, respectively, in the C-terminal domain. The highly conserved Gly23 residue in the N-terminal domain forms together with the charged Lys22 and the semiconserved Leu21 a beta hairpin in both MSP proteins. The majority of the conserved non-cysteine amino acids are located within the core of the Cterminal domain. The assembly of the highly conserved Pro56, Tyr59, and Val77 seems to be carefully orchestrated to achieve a packing cluster at the interface between the two two-stranded beta

sheets (Figure 5). The other highly conserved Cterminal tyrosine, Tyr75, is partially exposed and participates in a hydrophobic patch, which mainly consists of the aromatic ring of the semi-conserved Phe68 (Leu65 in pMSP) and the side-chain of the non-polar Val53. The other highly conserved noncysteine residues of the C-terminal domain are Val78, Pro83, and Lys85. The pattern of the conserved residues in MSP suggests that the disulfide bridges define the fold of the N-terminal domain, whereas the well-conserved hydrophobic residues of the C-terminal domain are needed for the packing of the C-terminal domain. An inspection of the gene for hMSP, which has four exons, reveals that the N-terminal domain of the mature protein is coded for by the second half of exon 2 followed by the entire exon 3 (the first half of exon 2 codes for all but the starting methionine of the signal peptide of MSP). The C-terminal domain is coded for by exon 4 (the exon 3/exon 4 boundary is in the codon for Leu52). The first part of the first loop in the N-terminal domain (Glu8-Lys17), which is the one with the less well defined structure, corresponds to the very end of exon 2 (the exon 2/ exon 3 boundary is in the codon for Lys17) and this part of MSP is the one that varies most between species (Figure 1). For instance, in pMSP this part of the molecule is three residues shorter than in hMSP and no similarity at all can be discerned in either the amino acid sequence or the nucleotide sequence. The relative orientation of the two domains is such that the MSPs have a rather flat, extended structure. In hMSP the distance is about 50 Å between the C of Lys81 in the far end of the C-terminal domain and the C of Glu8 in the N-terminal domain. Apart from the three amino acid residue inter-domain linker (Leu52-Ser54) and the disulfide bond between Cys37 and Cys73, the main interaction that restrains the relative orientation of the two domains, is between the N and C termini of the peptide chain. This is indicated by the NOEs observed between the beta protons of Ser1 (Gln1 in pMSP) and the methyl groups of Ile93 (Val90 in pMSP) (Figure 6). It seems as if this three-point contact between the two domains is sufficient to define their relative orientation resulting in an extended rod-like structure of the MSPs. A comparison of the human and porcine MSP structures shows that the secondary structure elements of the two proteins are very similar and that the disulfide bond arrangements are identical. The global fold is also very similar. A comparison of

hMSP has the extra insertion of three amino acid residues and where the amino acid sequence differs most between species. Other minor differences are the lack of -secondary structure in some parts of hMSP as compared with the porcine protein. For instance, residues Cys18-Asp20 and Asn24-His26 are not restrained to define a -secondary structure in hMSP in more than one out of ten structures. Despite the great conformational similarities between hMSP and pMSP regarding the secondary structure elements and the global fold, the electrostatic potential surfaces of the two proteins constitute a major striking difference. The charge

The highly conserved residues mentioned in the Discussion are shown in ball-and-sticks representation . The molecule is oriented as in Figure 2.

the ten best (lowest energy) structures for hMSP with those for pMSP shows a very good agreement (Figure 7) with an RMSD between the two sets of structures of 3.1(±0.3) Å for the entire molecule (excluding parts of the N terminus, residues 7­28) and as low as 1.0(±0.1) Å for independent alignments of the N and C-terminal domains (residues 2­ 6, 29­52 and residues 53­93, respectively). A minor difference between hMSP and pMSP is that the N-terminal loop region of hMSP (Gly9Lys17) is structurally more indistinct than its porcine counterpart (Ser9-Glu14). Interestingly, it is here that

Figure 8. Electrostatic potential surface of hMSP (upper pairs) and pMSP (lower pairs). In the left views the molecules are rotated 40° counter-clockwise about a vertical axis compared to the orientation in Figure 2. In the views to the right they are rotated another 180°. The nonnative N-terminal extension of the three glycine residues has been omitted from the Figures for clarity. Negative, neutral, and positive electrostatic potentials are displayed in red, white, and blue, respectively.

distribution of the two molecules look very alike on one side (left panel, Figure 8), whereas on the opposite side (right panel), the surface charge of pMSP bears very little resemblance to that of hMSP. On this side of the molecule, the surface of hMSP is almost exclusively covered by negatively charged side-chains, whereas the corresponding side of pMSP is mainly dressed with non-charged amino acids. Many substitutions where a negatively charged residue in hMSP has been replaced by a neutral residue in pMSP are responsible for this difference: Glu8  Gln8, Glu31  Val28, Glu44  Gln41,

Glu46  Ala43, Asp62  Asn59, Asp72  Thr69, Glu91  Gly88. The main surface similarity between the two MSPs is represented by the semi-conserved contiguous Asp60 and Glu79, which form a specific negatively charged region on the top side of the molecules. This structure might be part of a contrivance for species-specific binding partner/ target recognition. The disulfide bond arrangement, identical in hMSP and pMSP, differs for at least two of the bonds in the arrangement described for ostrich MSP.10 The arrangement, which was determined by trypsin digestion of the intact protein and analysis of the fragments with mass spectrometry, agrees with the human and porcine proteins regarding the intra-domain SS-bond in the C-terminal domain (Cys64-Cys87) and the SS-bond connecting the N and C-terminal domains (Cys37-Cys73) but would correspond to a Cys2-Cys18 and a probable Cys42Cys50 SS-bond in the human protein. In the structures of MSP presented here the two residues Cys18 and Cys42 are too far away from the cluster of Cys2, Cys49, and Cys50 to allow the accommodation of the ostrich bonding in the human protein. The difference in SS-bonding thus suggests a difference in the structure of the N-terminal domain of the ostrich MSP. The MSP protein has been isolated and characterized from several species: man, pig, rat, chicken, and ostrich and cDNA sequences are present from other species as well. According to comparisons of the known MSP sequences with other protein sequences in the public databases, the MSPs seem to constitute a unique protein family,10 suggesting also a unique three-dimensional structure. This suggestion is supported by structure similarity searches, which return no highly significant matches. The best match from the DALI server is a fibronectin domain (1fbr) that matches with a Z-score of 2.7. Therefore, we conclude that the fold of MSP is different from previously known structures. It has recently been found that hMSP binds with high affinity to CRISP-3 (cysteine-rich secretory protein 3), a protein present in the specific granules of neutrophilic granulocytes.26 CRISP-3, which is a 28 kDa protein (225 amino acid residues), was originally isolated from human granulocytes31 and has also been named SGP28 (specific granule protein of 28 kDa). CRISP-3 has been shown to be present, among other places, in saliva, blood plasma, seminal plasma and the male genital tract.32 Homologues of CRISP-3 are widespread in nature and have been found in mammals, reptiles, insects and even in plants.33 The function of CRISP-3 in the human body is presently unknown, but other CRISP proteins have been shown to block ion channels.34 The observation that MSP forms a high-affinity complex with granulocyte-derived CRISP-3 suggests that MSP may play a role in the restriction and localization of the effects of activated granulocytes. MSP has also been shown to bind PSPBP (PSP94 binding protein), a 47 kDa protein (436 amino acid residues) in human plasma.25 Homologues of

Sciences) using Advantage Klentaq Polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and the amplified fragments were recovered from the gels using a Sephaglas BandPrep kit (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) or a Gene-Clean II kit (BIO101, Vista, CA). Ligation-independent cloning in the pET30 Xa/LIC vector was performed using a pET-30 Xa/ LIC Vector Kit (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA). Vectors with inserts were transformed into competent Escherichia coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) and plasmids were purified from cultures of the NovaBlue cells. The nucleotide sequence of the insert and of adjoining parts of the vector was verified by DNA sequencing on both strands. DNA sequencing was done on an ABI 310 sequencer using an ABIprism Taq polymerase-based sequencing kit with fluorescent dye terminators (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Applied Biosystems). Analytical RP-HPLC was performed on a 4.6 mm × 250 mm Genesis C18 column (pore size 300 A, particle size 4 m) (Jones, Mid Glamorgan, UK) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear 10% to 60% gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1 % of trifluoroacetic acid in the solutions. hMSP expression vector A cDNA representing mature hMSP was prepared by reverse transcription of poly(A)-RNA from human prostate tissue using 5-GTTTGCTCAAAAATCTTTTTACTG3 (complementary to nucleotide 236 to 259 in the GenBank accession M34376) as the downstream antisense primer. The product was used as template in a PCR reaction with 5-GTACCTGTCTATAAGGAGTCCTGC-3 (nucleotide 72 to 95 in the GenBank sequence M34373) as the upstream sense primer and the same downstream antisense primer given above. The purified PCR product, which had the expected size (487 bp), was used as template for a PCR with the two primers: 5-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCGGTGGCGGTTCATGCTATTTCATACCTAAT-3 and 5-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCCCCTGTGCCTACTAGAAG-3 to give a PCR product with 5- and 3-ends adapted for cloning in the pET30 Xa/LIC vector and a sequence of the insert coding for mature human MSP with three extra amino-terminal glycine residues in order to allow the cleaving off of the vector coded poly (His)/S-protein tag. The purified PCR product, which had the expected size (348 bp), was inserted into the pET30 Xa/LIC vector and transformed into competent E. coli NovaBlue cells. The pET30 Xa/LIC plasmid was purified from cultures of NovaBlue cells and the nucleotide sequence of the insert and of adjoining parts of the pET30 Xa/LIC vector was verified by DNA sequencing on both strands. Cloning of pMSP cDNA A cDNA representing total RNA coding for the mature form of pMSP was prepared by reverse transcription of the poly(A)-RNA from porcine prostate tissue with 5GAGCTCTGGGCCCACTAGAA-3 (complementary to nucleotide 395 to 414 in the GenBank sequence with the accession no. S80724) as the downstream antisense primer. The product was then used as template in a PCR reaction with the same downstream antisense primer and 5GAAAGGACTCCCGCTCATCA-3 (nucleotide 32 to 51 in the GenBank sequence with the accession no. S80724) as the upstream sense primer. The purified PCR product, which had the expected size (383 bp), was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and five

PSPBP have been found in rodents but no function has been described.25 The N-terminal part of PSPBP (residues 4-170) has a sequence similarity with a corresponding N-terminal part of CRISP-3 (residues 17-183), indicating that this part of the two proteins is responsible for the binding of MSP. These parts of the two proteins belong to the sperm coating protein (SCP) domain family, present in several other proteins.35 There is no structure reported for PSPBP or any of its homologues but recently the three-dimensional structures were reported for the CRISP proteins stecrisp,34 triflin,33 and natrin,36 which are components of the venoms from the snakes Trimeresurus stejnegeri, T. flavoviridis, and Naja atra, respectively. All three are composed of an N-terminal domain, corresponding to the SCP domain, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain with the two domains connected by a small hinge region. According to the sequence comparison between PSPBP and CRISP-3 the binding part most probably corresponds to the N-terminal (SCP) domain of the CRISP proteins. It is unknown whether MSP binds any of the mentioned venom CRISPs but we have observed that hMSP binds pseudecin, a CRISP protein present in the venom of Pseudechis porphyriacus and that pMSP binds human CRISP-3 (unpublished). Pseudecin has 59% amino acid sequence identity to human CRISP-3 and pMSP has 51% amino acid sequence identity to hMSP. These observations indicate that the interactions between MSP and CRISP proteins are not highly sequence-dependent. With the determination of the structure of to MSPs it is now possible to investigate more closely the interaction of MSP with the CRISP proteins.

Material and Methods
Materials Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from DNA Technology A/S, Aarhus, Denmark. [15N] Ammonium chloride (15N >99%) and [13C6]D-glucose (13C >98%) were from Spectra Stable Isotopes, Columbia, MD. Activated bovine factor X was obtained by the procedure described elsewhere.37 Native hMSP and pMSP (the P1 form) proteins were purified from human and boar seminal plasma, respectively, using a method described previously.8 Human prostate tissue was obtained at operation and porcine at slaughter from a local slaughterhouse. The tissues were immediately cut into 2 mm pieces and frozen in an ethanol bath with solid carbon dioxide and kept at ­70 °C until use. Methods Total RNA was prepared by the Chomczynski and Sacchi procedure.38 Poly(A)-RNA was isolated from the total RNA using oligo(dT) coated paramagnetic polystyrene beads (Dynabeads(r) mRNA Purification Kit, Dynal Biotech, Oslo, Norway). Reverse transcriptions of poly(A)RNA were performed with an Expand Reverse Transcriptase kit (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR reactions were performed in a DNA Thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life

clones were isolated and sequenced on both strands. Two of the plasmid clones had a sequence identical to the GenBank sequence with the accession no. S80724; the other three were identical among themselves and differed in three positions from the GenBank sequence. The new DNA sequence coded exactly for the amino acid sequence determined for the dominating form (P1) of the MSP protein isolated from porcine seminal plasma8 while the GenBank sequence coded in position 42 for an asparagine instead of aspartic acid (this sequence probably corresponds to the P2-form of pMSP, see Fernlund et al.8). One of the three pGEM-T plasmids with the new pMSP cDNA sequence was selected to be used as template for the production of the expression vector for pMSP. pMSP expression vector The selected pGEM-T plasmid was used as template in a PCR reaction with the two primers: 5-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCGGTGGCGGTCAGTGCTATTTCATACCTAATCA-3 and 5-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCGGGCCCACTAGAAACACATTAT-3 to give a PCR product with 5 and 3-ends adapted for cloning in the pET30 Xa/LIC vector. It had a sequence coding for the dominating form (P1) of mature pMSP but with three extra amino-terminal glycine residues in order to allow the cleaving off of the vector coded poly(His)/S-protein tag. The purified PCR product, which had the expected size (335 bp), was inserted into the pET30 Xa/LIC vector and transformed into NovaBlue cells. The pET30 Xa/LIC plasmid was purified from cultures of NovaBlue cells and the nucleotide sequence of the insert and of adjoining parts of the vector was verified by DNA sequencing on both strands. Expression of MSP proteins The pET30 Xa/LIC plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) and the cells were grown in ordinary LB medium for expression of unlabelled protein or in a modified minimal medium enriched in trace metals and vitamins for uniform 15N and/or 13C labelling with 15NH4Cl and/or [U-13C]glucose as nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were initially grown in 50 ml of medium at 37 °C overnight. The culture was then diluted 20-fold with medium and growth was continued at 37 °C. Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl--D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at A600 nm 0.7-1.0. The induced cultures were grown at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 6000g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), recentrifuged and the pellet obtained was kept at ­20 °C overnight and then extracted at room temperature in 10 ml per g wet pellet of an extracting buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mM mercaptoethanol) followed by sonication for 2 min. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 17,000g for 60 min followed by filtering through a 0.45 m filter. The filtrate was loaded on a 5 ml Ni2+-loaded HiTrap Chelating HP column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The column was washed with 175 ml of the extracting buffer and eluted with 50 mM EDTA in the extraction buffer. The flow rate was 1 ml/min through the whole experiment. The eluate was continuously monitored at 280 nm and the eluted material was passed for refolding39 directly into 1 l of a well-stirred

Solution Structures of -Microseminoprotein ice-cold solution of 0.1 M TrisHAc (pH 8.5) containing 0.5 M L-arginine, 0.8 mM reduced glutathione, and 0.2 mM oxidized glutathione. The solution with the eluted expressed protein was kept in the refrigerator overnight, concentrated to about 50 ml by ultrafiltration using a membrane with a nominal cut off 10 kDa, dialyzed against 20 mM acetic acid, and finally lyophilized (after the precipitate that formed during the dialysis had been removed by centrifugation). The poly(His)/S-protein tag was cleaved off from the expressed protein by digestion at 37 °C for 24 h with activated bovine factor X in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), containing100 mM NaCl and 5 mM CaCl2. The enzyme/substrate ratio was 1/200. The cleaved protein was purified from the digest in 5 mg portions by HPLC on a Genesis semipreprative column (C18, 15 m, 25 cm × 12.5 mm) (Jones, Mid Glamorgan, UK) using a linear acetonitrile gradient from 10% to 60% in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The effluent corresponding to the main component was collected and lyophilized. NMR spectroscopy The protein samples used were either unlabelled native protein or uniformly 15N-labelled or uniformly 13 C, 15N-labelled recombinant protein. They were dissolved either in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O or in 99.9% 2H2O at pH 6.0 without any added buffer, and the protein concentrations were in the 3.4-4.2 mM range. All samples contained 0.1 mM NaN3 and 1 mM DSS (2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid). For RDC measurements a dilute liquid crystalline phase solution was prepared by adding hexanol to an isotropic solution of 0.2 mM pMSP dissolved in 90% H2O/10% 2 H2O containing 2.8% pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether at pH 6.140 or by adding 5 mg/ml of phage Pf141 to a 0.2 mM hMSP dissolved in 90% H2O/10% 2 H2O at pH 6.7. NMR measurements were carried out on Varian INOVA 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers at 37 °C or at 27 °C for RDC measurements. The quadrupolar splitting of the 2H NMR signal from the solvent in the RDC samples was observed to verify that the samples were oriented. The sequence-specific resonance assignments for mainchain HN, N, C C and C of MSP were obtained by using 1H-15N HSQC and three standard triple-resonance NMR experiments, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCO.42 Side-chain 1H and 13C resonances for MSP were assigned from two-dimensional homo-nuclear TOCSY (mixing times = 20, 70, and 110 ms), twodimensional 13C-edited HSQC, and three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY spectra. Aromatic resonances were assigned from a two-dimensional NOESY spectrum with 20 ms mixing time (where the aromatic protons show cross-peaks to the -protons) of a sample with 15Nlabelled MSP in 2H2O. Assignment of side-chain amide resonances of Asn and Gln was based on two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional 1H-1H-15N NOESY-HSQC. NOE restraints NOE cross-peaks were detected using two-dimensional H-1H NOESY spectra with 50 and 110 ms mixing times, for an unlabelled protein sample in 2H2O, a threedimensional 1H-1H-13C NOESY-HSQC spectrum with

Solution Structures of -Microseminoprotein 140 ms mixing time, for a 15N, 13C double labelled protein samples in 2H2O and from a three-dimensional 1H-1H-15N NOESY-HSQC spectrum with 150 ms mixing time for a sample of 15N-labelled MSP in H2O/2H2O. Dipolar couplings The one bond N-H couplings, were determined for isotropic and aligned MSP by IPAP 1H-15N HSQC43 and the one bond N-CO and two bond H-CO couplings from JHNCO spectra.44 Dipolar couplings were obtained from the difference between the couplings measured in the oriented phase and in the isotropic phase. For hMSP the couplings were measured at 37 °C and 600 MHz. For pMSP couplings were measured at 27 °C and 500 MHz. Data processing and analysis All data were processed using NMRPipe.45 The 1H resonance frequencies were referenced to the methyl resonances of internal DSS and 15N and 13C were indirectly referenced to the 1H reference. Spectra were analyzed in SPARKY (Goddard, T.D. & Kneller, D.G. University of California, San Francisco).  and  angles Backbone  and  torsion angles were derived from an analysis of 13C, 13C, 13C, 1H, and 15N chemical shifts using TALOS.46 For pMSP  torsion angles were also derived from 3JHN-H spin couplings. Hydrogen bond constraints On the basis of the analysis of the 1H-1H-15N NOESYHSQC spectrum typical NOE cross-peaks indicating hydrogen bonds in -sheet secondary structures were included as restraints in the structure calculations. All HN protons in the assumed hydrogen bonds also showed slow proton exchange. NMR structure determination The structure calculations were performed in three ways. (I) Manually assigned NOE restraints were used as input to the program CNS.47 (II) Automatic NOE assignment and structure calculation using CYANA 2.048 with extended backbone conformations as starting models and default settings from standard input files. (III) finally Xplor-NIH version 2.9.949 was used in order to include RDC restraints together with the NOE restraints from the CYANA calculations. The calculations in Xplor-NIH were performed in torsion angle space except for a short energy minimization in Cartesian coordinates. A conformational database potential50 was included in the calculations. The initial alignment tensor orientation for the structure calculations was determined by SVD on the starting structure and kept fixed during the torsion angle dynamics. In the final energy minimization in Cartesian coordinates the tensor was allowed to float. The final force constant for the RDC was set to 1.0 kcal mol-1 Hz-1. A total of 200 structures were calculated and from these ten structures with the lowest overall energy were chosen to represent the structure of MSP. Structure analysis and visualization

The quality of the final structures was analyzed using PROCHECK51 and WHAT_CHECK.52 Structural analysis and molecular visualization were performed with MOLMOL.53 Data Bank accession numbers The chemical shifts for hMSP and pMSP, including three N-terminal glycine residues, at pH 6.0 and 310 K have been deposited in BioMagResBank with the entry number BMRB 7243. The atomic coordinates for the final families of ten structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 2iz3 and 2iz4 for hMSP and pMSP, respectively).
