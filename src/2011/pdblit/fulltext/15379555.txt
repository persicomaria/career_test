ABSTRACT: Expression of the truncated (lacking an N-terminal signal sequence) structural gene of Thermus thermophilus cytochrome c552 in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli yields both dimeric (rC557) and monomeric (rC552) cytochrome c-like proteins [Keightley, J. A., et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 1200612016], which form spontaneously without the involvement of cytochrome c maturation factors. Cytochrome rC557 is comprised of a dimer and has been structurally characterized [McRee, D., et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 6537-6544]. Unexpectedly, the monomeric rC552 transforms spontaneously to a cytochromelike chromophore having, in its reduced state, the Qoo transition (R-band) at 572 nm (therefore called p572). The X-ray crystallographic structure of rC552, at 1.41 Å resolution, shows that the 2-vinyl group of heme ring I is converted to a [heme-CO-CH2-S-CH2-CR] conjugate with cysteine 11. Electron density maps obtained from isomorphous crystals of p572 at 1.61 Å resolution reveal that the 2-vinyl group has been oxidized to a formyl group. This explains the lower energy of the Qoo transition, the presence of a new, high-frequency band in the resonance Raman spectra at 1666 cm-1 for oxidized and at 1646 cm-1 for reduced samples, and the greatly altered, paramagnetically shifted 1H NMR spectrum observed for this species. The overall process defines a novel mechanism for oxidation of the 2-vinyl group to a 2-formyl group and adds to the surprising array of chemical reactions that occur in the interaction of heme with the CXXCH sequence motif in apocytochromes c.

Cytochrome c synthesis in Gram-negative prokaryotes normally occurs from a messenger RNA that encodes a preapoprotein having a short (20 amino acids) N-terminal signal peptide. The latter is recognized by the general secretory pathway which directs the pre-apoprotein to the periplasm. The signal peptide is further recognized by leader

peptidases that cleave it to form apocytochrome c. Heme is also synthesized in the cytoplasm and transferred to the periplasm with assistance from still unidentified factors. Apoprotein and heme are thus brought together in the periplasm with the correct rotational orientation of the heme maintained, and additional Ccm1 factors assist in the correct formation of two thioether linkages with the common CXXCH sequence motif. The Escherichia coli system has been extensively reviewed by Thony-Meyer (1, 2), Kranz ¨ (3), and Ferguson (4) and their co-workers.

Conversion of Heme IX to Protein-Bound Spirographis Heme In a number of cases, expression in the E. coli cytoplasm of truncated cytochrome c genes (those lacking the code for the signal peptide) yields an apocytochrome c that folds normally and binds heme correctly (5-12). For example, the truncated gene for Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c yields a protein with correct thioether linkages, apparently due to the correct proximity of protein thiol and heme vinyl entities, and proper folding (5-12). For other cytochromes c, however, cytoplasmic apocytochrome either is degraded or aggregates, and no holocytochrome c is formed (13). In the case of the truncated Thermus thermophilus cytochrome c552 gene, expression in E. coli leads to incompletely or incorrectly formed versions of the protein that reveal novel heme-protein interactions. The T. thermophilus cytochrome c552 was first described by Hon-Nami in 1977 (14). When its truncated structural gene was placed under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in a plasmid borne by E. coli, the cells became distinctly red in color (15). This simple observation suggested the synthesis of abundant amounts of holocytochrome c. Purification, however, yielded dimeric rC557 and monomeric cytochrome rC552 (11) (see below). X-ray structure analysis yielded the novel findings that rC557 is comprised of cytochrome monomers in which the heme moeity is "flipped" about its R- axis, cysteine 14 has formed a thioether linkage with the 2-vinyl rather than the 4-vinyl group, the 2-vinyl group remains unreacted, and a disulfide has formed between the monomers by oxidation of the two Cys11 residues (16). This finding is important to the development of expression systems for cytochromes c. Recently, there have been significant advances in the development of molecular genetic, expression systems for obtaining useful quantities of native-like cytochromes c. These are needed to address the roles of these proteins in energy metabolism, mechanisms of electron transfer, protein control of redox potentials, protein folding, apoptosis, etc. These and related efforts continue to be limited by the availability of large quantities of native-like, recombinant proteins (see ref 17 for discussion). E. coli is a natural choice for the development of an expression system. The first of these involved plasmiddirected expression of yeast (Saccharomyces cereVisiae) 1-isocytochrome c in the cytoplasm of E. coli (10). Originally, the 1-isocytochrome c structural gene was tandemly expressed with the yeast cytochrome c (heme) lyase gene and produced 15 mg of mature 1-isocytochrome c per liter of culture medium. The material was spectrally identical to native protein, but Lys72 was not trimethylated, as occurs in yeast cells. A variation on this system (17), in which the yeast heme lyase gene was tandemly expressed with the structural gene for horse heart cytochrome c, gave yields of native-like protein as high as 100 mg per liter of culture medium. Unfortunately, the yeast heme lyase does not recognize prokaryotic apocytochromes c (18). An alternative expression protocol, though not as quantitatively dramatic, has been to insert code for a signal peptide upstream of the cytochrome c structural code, which leads to transport of the pre-apocytochrome into the E. coli periplasm. Coexpression of periplasm-directed Ccm factors, from an independently propagated plasmid (19), has been found to yield modest but useful amounts (1 mg per liter of culture medium) of soluble, native-like cytochromes c

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 38, 2004 12163 from Paracoccus denitrificans (20) and T. thermophilus (21). It has been noted that this system has a much broader range of acceptable pre-apoproteins (18). None of these systems is perfect, however, and their development continues. As noted by Rumbley et al. (17), there are issues of folding traps, fidelity of heme insertion, and possibly incorrect chemical interaction of heme with the CXXCH residues. Our previous work on the expression of the truncated version of the T. thermophilus cytochrome c gene showed that at least two "near" cytochromes actually form in the absence of assistance from maturation factors (11). Heme inversion (16) is now recognized as a common error of cytochrome c synthesis in the in Vitro reaction of heme with apocytochromes c (13, 22, 23) and in ViVo in the case of the Lys8Gly mutant form of horse cytochrome c (17), despite the presence of the heme lyase. It is reasonable that knowledge of other, unexpected interactions between the two thiol groups of the apocytochrome c and the two vinyl groups of the heme, as reported here, is important for understanding correct cytochrome c synthesis. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Recombinant Cytochromes. The cytochrome c notation, origin, and defining properties are presented in footnote 1. Native-like cytochrome c552, called rsC552, was obtained as described by Fee et al. (21). Monomeric, recombinant cytochrome rC552, which is the starting material for this work, was prepared from aerobically grown E. coli cells as described by Keightley et al. (11) and freed of dimeric, recombinant rC557 as described by McRee et al. (16). The p572 forms spontaneously from cytochrome rC552 and can be purified as follows. Approximately 5 mg of purified rC552 was exchanged into 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 (solution A) and heated in a sealed Eppendorf tube at 70 °C for 1 h. The protein was then loaded onto a 5 mL, cation-exchange column (Amersham-Pharmacia Mono S) and developed as follows: 0-20 mL of 0% solution B, 20-60 mL of 0-50% solution B, and 60-95 mL of 50-100% solution B. Solution B is solution A with 0.1 M NaCl. Fractions (1 mL) were collected. Most of the cytochrome elutes between 15 and 35% solution B, although small amounts of cytochrome elute throughout the elution profile. The pattern is variable from sample to sample and quite complex. Optical spectra of each fraction were recorded in oxidized and reduced states, and spectrally pure p572 was usually found near 25 mL (25% solution B). Other fractions contained mixtures of p572 and rC552. Fractions largely free of rC552 were combined and concentrated for use in various experiments. Chromatography on a Vydac 201TP54 reversephase column under denaturing conditions shows a single sharp band in the elution profile (see below). The chromophore is stable to the usual laboratory manipulation. BCA protein analyses suggest red572 ) 22 400 M-1 cm-1, and this value is used throughout to determine p572 concentration. General Methods. Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a SLM.AMINCO model DB3500 spectrophotometer in 1 cm cells. Fully oxidized proteins were obtained by adding potassium ferricyanide to a final concentration of 10 µM, and reduced proteins were prepared by additions of minute amounts of solid sodium dithionite to the optical cuvette and thorough mixing. The reduced minus oxidized extinction coefficient [ ) 14.3 mM-1 cm-1 (14)] was used

Fee et al. was dissolved in 0.66 mL of 5% formic acid, and a pepsin (CalBiochem) solution was added to a final w/w ratio of 10:1. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 22 h followed by drying with in Vacuo centrifugation. The dried samples were redissolved in 0.1% TFA in water and applied to a Vydac 201TP54 column, and a 5 to 65% acetonitrile gradient, in the presence of 0.1% TFA, was used to elute the peptides. The eluant was monitored at both 400 and 214 nm, and the heme-containing peptide was subsequently characterized by mass spectrometry. It is noteworthy that these compounds are unstable and decompose over the course of a few weeks even when dry at -20 °C. Mass Spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry of proteins was carried out at the Scripps Research Center for Mass Spectrometry (La Jolla, CA) using a Perkin-Elmer API 100 Sciex single-quadrupole mass analyzer with the orifice potential set at 100 V. Mass spectra were obtained from ion spectra using the Perkin-Elmer program BioMultiView. MALDI-TOF experiments were carried out using a PerSeptive spectrometer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) FTMS experiments were performed on an IonSpec FTMS mass spectrometer (see ref 34). CD Spectroscopy. Samples of oxidized rC552 or rsC552 for circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were 10 µM in protein (for far-UV spectra) or 100 µM in protein (for Soret region spectra) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-710 spectropolarimeter at 22 °C on samples in a quartz cell with a path length of 0.1 cm. Resonance Raman. Spectra were obtained using a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (focal length of 0.67 m with a 2400 groove/mm grating), a Princeton Instruments liquid N2-cooled (LN-1100PB) CCD detector, and a Kaiser Optical holographic super-notch filter. Excitation (413 nm, 5 mW) came from a Coherent Innova 302 Kr laser. Spectra collected in a 90°-scattering geometry for 5 min at room temperature were obtained from 10 µL samples [protein concentration of 20-30 µM in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8)] in glass capillaries. Frequencies, accurate to 1 cm-1, were calibrated relative to indene. Princeton Instruments' WinSpec software was used for data acquisition. Exported ASCII-xy files were analyzed using GRAMS-386 software (Galactic Industries). NMR Spectroscopy. Protein samples for 1H NMR spectroscopy were 0.25-1.5 mM in protein in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) in 90% D2O. Samples were oxidized with a 3-fold excess of potassium ferricyanide and concentrated using a Centricon-10 device prior to data collection. NMR spectra were collected on a 500 MHz Varian INOVA instrument at 25 °C and using a recycle time of 250 ms. Spectra were processed with 30 Hz line broadening. Electrochemistry. Electrochemical experiments were carried out in a three-compartment cell using a Bioanalytical Systems (BAS) model CV 50W electrochemical analyzer. The gold-disk working electrode was polished with 0.05 µm aluminum oxide (Buehler), thoroughly rinsed, and then chemically modified by sonication for 30 min in a 0.05 mM aqueous solution of pyridine 4-aldehydesemicarbazone. Potentials were measured versus a standard calomel electrode. The reference electrode was separated from the working compartment by a Luggin capillary. Data were recorded at a pyridine 4-aldehydesemicarbazone-modified

to determine approximate concentrations of rC552. Pyridine hemochromes were prepared according to the method of Berry and Trumpower (24). The level of protein was measured by the BCA protein assay kit of Pierce according to manufacturer's directions. Cytochrome c oxidase activity, using Thermus cytochrome ba3 purified by the method of Keightley et al. (25), was determined polarographically at 25 °C using an Instech (Plymouth Meeting, PA) unit with output to a strip chart recorder. X-ray Crystallography. Crystals of rC552 (4 °C) and p572 (room temperature), being isomorphous with those of rsC552, were obtained in sitting drops against 36% MPEG 5K (w/ w), 0.2 M imidazole malate buffer (pH 6.3) using 12 mg/ mL protein suspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 100 mM NaCl (see ref 21). Cryoprotection of crystals was achieved by transferring them to mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) to a resolution of 1.41 Å for rC552 and 1.61 Å for p572 (see Table 1). The primary data were processed using MOSFLM (26), scaled, and further reduced using the CCP4 suite of programs (27) (see Table 1). Initial electron density maps were generated using the native and recombinant structures (21, 28) (PDB entries 1C52 and 1DT1) and interpreted further using XtalView (29). The model was refined in successive rounds using SHELXL (30, 31) with a test set of 5% randomly chosen reflections being used to calculate Rfree at each stage. X-ray amplitudes, phases, and derived atomic coordinates have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry 1QYZ for rC552 and PDB entry 1ROQ for p572). Heme atoms are referenced in both PDB notation and that found in Falk (32). Protein Chemistry. Pepsin digestion was carried out with a 2 mg/mL stock pepsin solution in 5% formic acid according to the methods of Smyth (33). Holocytochrome c (0.78 mg)

Conversion of Heme IX to Protein-Bound Spirographis Heme gold electrode with a scan rate of 25 mV/s. Both native and recombinant cytochromes gave linear plots of peak current versus (scan rate)1/2, consistent with a diffusion-controlled process. Approximately 20% of the rC552 sample was converted to p572 (as confirmed by visible spectroscopy), resulting in a shoulder in the voltammogram at 325 mV. The protein concentrations were 0.3 mM for p572 and the 1:1 rC552/p572 mixture, and 1 mM for rsC552 in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7). RESULTS Formation and Purification of p572 The as-isolated rC552 spontaneously converts to a material having an absorption band at 572 nm unless maintained at cold-room temperatures. This occurs upon standing at room temperature for several days or by heating at elevated temperatures for a few minutes. Addition of ferricyanide causes this peak to disappear, and subsequent addition of dithionite results in reappearance of the 572 nm band as well as a significantly attenuated 552 nm band. Additional experiments revealed that neither dioxygen nor light is required and that one-electron, reduced rC552 was converted to p572 with equal efficiency (not shown). Figure 1A shows the UV (left panel) and visible (right panel) optical absorption spectra of purified rC552 in the oxidized (traces i, dotted line) and reduced (traces i, solid line) states. Formation of p572 was started with fully oxidized rC552 by heating for 30 min at 70 °C.2 After heating had been carried out, the spectrum changed to that shown as the thick solid line in Figure 1A (trace ii). Addition of a slight molar excess of ferricyanide yielded the bottom dotted line in Figure 1A (traces iii), and subsequent addition of excess dithionite gave the bottom solid line in Figure 1A (traces iii), indicating a mixture of reduced rC552 and reduced p572. These observations suggest that some portion of the as-isolated rC552 spontaneously converts to a new form of iron porphyrin. Appearance of the reduced form of p572 probably results from the presence of spurious reductants in the solution rather than reduced p572 being a mechanistic requirement (see below). Such behavior has been observed in other high-potential metalloproteins (35). It is possible to purify p572 from the remaining rC552 by cation exchange, possibly because only the p572 is in the one-electron reduced form and therefore has a different overall charge than the residual cytochromes c (see ref 36); details are provided in Experimental Procedures. With this technique, we prepared 1 mg quantities of pure p572 for characterization. Evidence of purity includes a single peak on reversed-phase liquid chromatography, a single band upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
2 The appearance of the 572 nm band is complete in 3 min under these conditions and requires neither light nor air. A fairly extensive study of the effect of temperature and pH on the conversion of rC552 to p572 revealed the following. At pH 7.2 and 70 °C, the conversion is first-order over several half-times of the reaction; kobs  30 s-1. The conversion fraction, moles of p572 per initial moles of rC552, is 0.3 and is independent of temperature. The activation energy (Ea) for this reaction is 25 kcal/mol, accounting for the slowness of the reaction at cold-room temperatures. The ratio of p572 to starting rC552 is strongly pH dependent, being zero at pH 6, 0.3 at pH 8.3, a maximum of 0.5 at pH 10, and zero at pH 13. Thus, a higher pH favors rC552-top572 conversion, suggesting the possible involvement of a catalytic base.

(data not shown), electrospray mass spectrometry (see below), and formation of single crystals suitable for X-ray crystallographic studies (see below). To quantify p572, we determined that the 572 nm absorption band has a molar absorbance red572 of =22400 M-1 cm-1 (see Experimental Procedures). Table 2 lists relevant absorption bands and available extinction coefficients for the different proteins used in this study. These preliminary observations suggest that p572 is a modified cytochrome c that retains electron transfer competency. Figure 1B shows optical absorption spectra of purified, oxidized, and reduced p572, and Table 2 lists quantitative data. The spectrum of the oxidized form differs little from that of oxidized rC552, whereas the reduced protein is significantly different. The shift of the Q00 transitions to lower energy in p572 would be consistent with the presence of a carbonyl or Schiff base coupled to the porphyrin -system, as occurs in heme A-containing proteins (refs 37 and 38 and references therein). Hints of this came with the

FIGURE 2: Electrospray mass spectra of recombinant cytochrome rC552 and p572 dissolved in 10 mM ammonium acetate and freed from Na+ ions by gel filtration. Cytochrome rC552 exhibits peaks at 14 862, 14 875, and 14 893 Da, while p572 exhibits a very weak signal at 14 862 Da, a dominant signal at 14 875 Da, and a very weak signal at 14 893 Da. Spectra were recorded as described in Experimental Procedures.

qualitative observations that treatment with excess hydrazine, borohydride, or cyanoborohydride (see ref 39 and references therein) shifted the 572 nm absorption band to 550 nm (data not shown). Mass Spectrometry Mass spectral studies provided the first clue to the origin of the new chromophore. Figure 2 shows electrospray mass spectra of rC552 (top) and purified p572 (bottom). The expected mass of the recombinant rC552 is 14 862 Da (11). Instead, we observe three components as described previously (11). The top spectrum shows a dominant peak at 14 893 Da, a second, weaker peak at 14 875 Da, and, at similar intensity, the expected peak at 14 862 Da. (The origin of the smallest peak, at 14 848 Da, is not known.) p572 shows a major peak at 14 875 Da, corresponding to the central peak observed with rC552, and minor peaks at 14 862 and 14 893 Da. Given that the uncertainties in the experimental masses are approximately (2 Da, the dominant feature of rC552 is the presence of an unexpected, additional mass of (14 893 Da minus the constant 14 862 Da) 31 ( 2 Da. Similarly, p572 contains an additional (14 875 Da minus 14 862 Da) 13 ( 2 Da. These data are broadly consistent with the presence of two additional O atoms in rC552 and one additional O atom in p572, not considering loss of protons (see below). The availability of relatively small amounts of rC552 (15) and even smaller amounts of p572 obviated large-scale isolation and heme extraction from the protein, as has been done with other cytochromes c (see refs 40 and 41, for example). Therefore, to further characterize the modified heme, we degraded holoprotein with pepsin followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry of chromatographically purified, heme-containing peptides (see Experimental Procedures). The heme peptide prepared from rsC552 is expected to have the amino acid sequence Ala-Gln-Cys-Ala-Gly-Cys-

His-Gln-Gln-Asn-Gly-Gln-Gly-Ile-Pro-Gly-Ala-Phe with the heme attached to the two cysteine residues via thioether links. The monoisotopic mass of the singly protonated form of this entity is 2402.96 Da, while the isotopically averaged mass is 2404.49 Da. Additional data are presented in the Supporting Information (Table 1-SM) and lie within the error limits of these predicted values, thus confirming its structure. By contrast, heme peptide isolated from p572 by the same procedure and subjected to identical treatment shows masses 12-13 Da greater3 (Table 1-SM). The mass spectral data thus impose an important boundary condition on the possible chemistry by which rC552 converts to p572, namely, that there can be no further addition of, e.g., O atoms (see Discussion). Crystallographic Characterization of rC552 Crystals of rC552 were grown at 4 °C to minimize conversion to p572 (see Experimental Procedures), mounted on nylon loops, flash-frozen, and transported to SSRL at liquid nitrogen temperature. After data collection at 100 K, one crystal was dissolved into a minimum volume of buffer at ice temperature. The optical absorption spectrum of the dissolved protein registered the complete absence of either 552 or 572 nm bands, indicating no significant reduction or conversion of heme had occurred while in the X-ray beam. Once this solution had been heated for a few moments, a strong band appeared at 572 nm, indicating that factors vital to the conversion of rC552 to p572 were retained during the crystallographic experiment (not shown). The structure of rC552 was determined at a resolution of 1.41 Å (Table 1), and coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (entry 1QYZ). The overall structure is generally similar to that of native cytochrome c552 (PDB entry 1C52) or native-like, recombinant rsC552 (PDB entry 1DT1); see Figure 3A. Differences between the structures of native c552 and p572 exist in the lysine rich region from Lys95 to Lys101, where the electron density map of the latter does not permit the main chain to be traced. Similar disorder was reported for the native-like rsC552 structure (21), and in the rC552 structure, the chain could not be traced from Val97 through Gly99. These
3 We have not attempted to isolate a heme peptide from rC 552 because of the likelihood that it would spontaneously convert to p572 during the experiment.

FIGURE 3: Stereoview (wall-eye) showing overlapping structures of native rC552 and p572. (A) The complete native (rsC552) structure is shown as a blue ribbon overlapped with that of rC552 as a red ribbon. Proteins were aligned on the basis of their heme positions. This structure contains the heme-to-cysteine 11 bridge as a ball-and-stick model. Significant differences between the protein structures are seen only in the region of residues 10-13. (B) Overlapping ribbon structures (N-terminus to Cys14) of rsC552 (red), rC552 (blue), and p572 (yellow). The small colored balls correspond to the positions of the cytsteine 11 CR atom in each structure. The program RIBBONS recognizes residues 11-15 in rC552 and residues 9-15 in p572 as -turn and coil rather than R-helix as in rsC552. The Fe-to-cysteine 11 CR distances are 6.51 Å for rsC552, 8.92 Å for rC552, and 8.92 Å for p572.

differences were previously attributed to differences in intermolecular packing in the different crystal types rather than real differences in structure and are not discussed further. It is also noteworthy that the heme and the axial ligand positions do not differ significantly from those in the native structure. There are significant structural differences in the region of heme ring I and nearby residues, Gln10, Cys11, Ala12, and Gly13, within which Cys11 lies 3 Å farther from the heme than in the native structure (see Figure 3B). On either side of this stretch of the polypeptide, the structure of the protein is highly similar to that of the native protein. Particularly important is the normal thioether linkage between Cys14 and the 4-vinyl group of heme ring II and coordination of the His15 N and Met69 S atoms to the heme iron. By contrast, the electron density shows an abnormal thioether linkage among ring I, 2-vinyl, and Cys-11. This is evident in the experimental electron density (as an "omit" map in which Cys11 is replaced by Gly at position 11) of this region (see Figure 4), and the model is consistent with a CO-CH2S-CH2 bridge between the heme and cysteine 11. Here we have superimposed an |Fo| - |Fc| map on an atomic model that accounts for the experimental structure factors; the metric features of the bridge are summarized in footnote 4. Efforts

to fit the observed electron density with that expected from a CA peroxide adduct (42) were unsuccessful because the hydrophobic side chain of Phe72 occupies the only space available for the second O atom of a peroxide. It is possible that the Phe72 side chain is not properly folded against the heme during the collapse of the protein about the heme. A search of the literature revealed that this arrangement of atoms has been found previously in nature as ethylthiopropan-2-one (43) and has been synthesized on a few occasions (refs 44-46 and references therein), although little is known about its chemical reactivity. Assembled within a steroid-like compound, an X-ray structure has been determined (46; Cambridge Crystallographic Structure Database

reference number 177055), which is quite similar to that reported above except for a significantly different CB-SC -CR torsional angle (-117.96° vs +87.6°).5 The proposed bridging structure would not, at first sight, be expected to be very reactive. Indeed, this arrangement of atoms is apparently stable at room temperature in water and in brine, as noted (46). However, within rC552, it appears to be quite reactive and can be converted to p572, as noted above. To account for formation of the bridge, we suggest that the S atom of Cys11, as either a thiolate or a thiyl radical, reacts with CB of the 2-vinyl group with subsequent reactions involving O2 yielding a CA-peroxo intermediate which decays to the bridge structure observed in the crystal. See Scheme 1 in the Discussion. Crystallographic Characterization of p572 Crystals of p572, isomorphous with those of rC552, were grown at room temperature and diffracted to 1.61 Å (PDB entry 1ROQ) (Table 1). The general structure is very similar to that of native (1C52) and native-like, recombinant rsC552 (1DT1). In this case, the crystal was not examined for oneelectron reduction in the X-ray beam. As in the case of rC552, outside of the amino acid sequence region of residues 10-13, there are no significant differences between p572 and the native cytochrome c structure. As with rC552, p572 contains a normal thioether linkage between Cys14 and the 4-vinyl group of heme ring II. However, important differences, relevant to the distinguishing properties of p572, occur at the 2-vinyl on heme ring I and in the region of Gln10, Cys11, Ala12, and Gly13 compared with both native and rC552 structures. Indeed, the polypeptide chain in this region is very similar to that of rC552 (see Figure 3B). Figure 5A shows an "omit" (|Fo - Fc|) map of the space about heme ring I and Cys11. A carbonyl group accounts for the portion of the difference map near the heme, likely

The corresponding angles are as follows: 118.53° for C17-C20-C21, 118.24° for C21-C21-S1, 103.43° for C21-S1-C22, and 109.62° for S1-C22-C25. The corresponding torsional angles are as follows: -166.75° for C17-C20-C21-S1, -70.00° for C21-C21-S1-C22, and -171.96° for C21-S1-C22-C25.

formyl, lying approximately within the plane of the porphyrin (Figure 5B); there appears to be a weak connection between 2-vinyl CA and Cys11 in p572, suggesting some heterogeneity in the p572 reaction product. The electron density map in the region of cysteine 11 is dominated by two large peaks evidently due to disorder of the cysteine 11 S atom. A single round of refinement of the structure using REFMAC5, as part of the CCP4 suite of programs (27), suggested the two peaks could be modeled with relative S occupancy of 0.65 and 0.35. This accounts for the large peaks of density but leaves some 4 positive difference density near the smaller of the two S peaks (not shown). Thus, we were unable to model the difference data satisfactorily with two conformations of Cys11 using normal torsion angles. This residual error may reflect the presence of the putative thiirane CH2 atoms, although it is not sufficiently defined to attempt a fit using an R/S mixture of cysteine 11 thiiranes (see below). The Gln10, Cys11, Ala12 region is not well fit by the current model, perhaps because of structural heterogeneity. For these reasons, it is important not to overinterpret the observed electron density in this region (see the Discussion). Spectral Characterization of rC552 and p572 The spectral properties of these aberrant cytochromes c should support the proposed crystallographic structures. Accordingly, we have examined rC552 and p572 by UVvisible optical absorption, circular dichroism, rR, and highfrequency 1H NMR spectroscopies. Optical Absorption Spectra. Spectra shown in Figure 1 that arise from the low-spin, Fe(II) versions of the particular cytochromes c are generally known to arise from -* transitions of the porphyrin macrocycle. Details, including wavelength and intensities, of these transitions are influenced by, and therefore carry information about, porphyrin side chains, the nature of the ligands on the heme iron, and the environment within the protein (cf. refs 32 and 47-50). For example, in native and native-like cytochromes c552 and rsC552, respectively, the Q00 transition is split into two transitions resulting from perturbations that lower the normally D2h symmetry of the porphyrin and lead the normally degenerate eg levels to assume different energies (51-53). Indeed, the similarity of spectral splitting in these proteins indicates their structural identity (21). A strong indication that rC552 is structurally different from the native-

(B) Similar omit map obtained by including the above heme atoms in the refinement while retaining glycine in place of cysteine at position 11.

like protein is the apparent absence of Q00 splitting in rC552 (see Figure 8 of ref 11). The dramatically shifted  and Q00 bands of p572 (see Table 2) indicate a structural change affecting the energy levels of A1u, A2u, and possibly eg. It is well-known that electrophilic side chains such as vinyl and formyl cause the visible and Soret bands to shift to longer wavelengths (54, 55). The pyridine hemochromogen spectrum of p572 has a peak at 581 nm, which is essentially identical with that of 2(4)-formyldeutero IX porphyrin (32) and slightly lower in energy than that of heme A6 (24). This provides rather strong evidence for the presence of a monoformyl porphyrin that, because of the Cys14-4-vinyl thioether link, also does not have a vinyl group. Note that optical spectra would likely not distinguish the following possible bridging structures in rC552: (a) the CdO group is orthogonal to the plane of the heme, (b) the CA had reacted with a hydrogen atom as opposed to O2 to form CH2 at CA (see below), and (c) an sp3 CA atom bearing a hydroperoxide group. CD Spectroscopy. As shown in the Supporting Information (Figure 1SM), the far-UV CD spectrum of rsC552 displays minima at 208 and 222 nm, as expected for a protein with a high R-helical content. The spectrum of rC552 also has minima at 208 and 222 nm, but with intensities significantly lower than those observed for rsC552 (panel A of Figure
6 Note that heme A, which has one formyl and vinyl group each, has its pyridine hemochrome maximum at 586 nm (24).

1SM). This may reflect the slightly lower R-helical content in rC552 that can be seen in the structure (Figure 3A,B). The CD spectrum of rsC552 in the Soret region displays a large positive band at 405 nm and a small negative band at 417 nm, whereas the Soret CD spectrum of purified rC552 has positive (403 nm) and negative (417 nm) bands with intensities similar to each other (panel B of Figure 1SM). The positive Soret CD band of rC552 is significantly lower in intensity (by a factor of 2) than that for rsC552. The CD spectrum in this region arises from protein-induced deformation of the heme (56) and from the interaction of the heme with aromatic groups in its vicinity (57). Although small, these shifts nevertheless demonstrate that the local heme environment in rC552 is significantly perturbed. The lower intensities in rC552 may indicate the presence of substantial structural heterogeneity in the molecule, or as suggested by Wittung-Stafshede (58), newly isolated rC552 may have the properties of a "molten globule". Raman Spectroscopy. Resonance Raman (rR) spectra (59) have been reported for native cytochrome c552 (60, 61) and native-like, recombinant rsC552 (21). We present spectra of oxidized and reduced forms of cytochromes rsC552, rC552, and p572. Table 3 summarizes the normal-mode frequencies (62) that we have assigned. Primary spectra are shown in Figure 6 and Figures 2SM-5SM of the Supporting Information. The data for the recombinant rsC552 are indistinguishable from those of native cytochrome c552 published previously

The typical sample concentration is 20-30 µM, with a 2400 groove/mm grating; the entrance slit was set to 150 µm, and data were accumulated over a period of 5 min. All spectra were recorded at room temperature, and the typical sample concentration was 20-30 µM in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8). Additional spectra are provided in the Supporting Information.

(21, 60) (see Figures 2SM and 3SM, dotted lines). Moreover, these spectra are also very similar to those of yeast cytochrome c (63). The comparison is obvious for the spectra of oxidized adducts all recorded at room temperature. However, the spectra of reduced yeast cytochrome c in the study by Hu et al. (63) were recorded at 12 K, affording greater resolution and frequencies 4-9 cm-1 higher than those obtained at room temperature. Given this, the rR spectra of ferrocytochrome rsC552 and yeast ferrocytochrome c are quite similar, confirming the similar chromophores and immediate protein environment in these homologous proteins.

As shown in Table 3, normal-mode frequencies (62) 10, 19 (observed with visible excitation), and, to a lesser extent, 3 are essentially unchanged for rsC552, rC552, and p572, confirming identical spin and coordination states of the central Fe in both oxidation states of all three cytochromes. Also similar are the 4 frequencies, which are useful in identifying the Fe oxidation state. On the other hand, frequencies of modes involving the periphery of the porphyrin and its substituents, that is, 2 and 11, show differences ranging from 8 to 20 cm-1, consistent with changes in the heme periphery, in both oxidized and reduced adducts, among the three species. Regardless of oxidation state or excitation wavelength, the rR spectra of rsC552 and rC552, compared in Figures 2SM and 3SM of the Supporting Information, are quite similar. This implies that little overlap occurs between the carbonyl group of the bridge and the heme -electron system in rC552. As noted above, the observed 70° angle between the carbonyl and heme planes is sufficiently close to orthogonal to prevent conjugation and resonance enhancement of carbonyl vibrations in the rR spectrum of rC552 (64-68). This explains the overall similarity to that of spectra of rC552 and rsC552, despite their significant structural differences. Our spectra confirm identical axial ligation in all three adducts but demonstrate differences in the peripheral substituents. The low-frequency feature at 412 cm-1 in the spectrum of oxidized rsC552 increases in frequency to 418 cm-1 and decreases in intensity in the spectrum of oxidized rC552 (Figure 3SM of the Supporting Information, trace A). Similar differences are noted in the spectra of the reduced adducts (Figure 3SM, trace B). This feature is assigned to the C CACB bending motion of the covalent Cys linkages (63). The intensity decrease is consistent with the crystallographic data. That is, as the CAdO group is held roughly orthogonal to the heme plane in the rC552, the CB position and the vibrational bending motion itself are forced out of plane and are no longer resonance-enhanced in the spectrum of rC552. Similarly, the increased frequency of the bend is consistent with the greater s character of CA and, hence,

Conversion of Heme IX to Protein-Bound Spirographis Heme

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 38, 2004 12171 ppm (shifts from spectrum in Figure 7B) in the spectrum of oxidized, unheated rC552 have been assigned to heme methyls 3 and 8, respectively, and the upfield-shifted resonance at -15 ppm is assigned to the axial Met -CH3 (16). After the sample had been heated to 70 °C followed by cooling to 25 °C, and oxidation of the reduced p572 with a small excess of ferricyanide, resonances attributed to p572 appear at 41.0, 40.3, and -19 ppm. The 1H NMR spectrum shown in Figure 7D is that of the oxidized form of purified p572, thereby confirming the assignment described above. The heme methyl resonances in the rC552 remaining after heating shift slightly from their positions in unheated rC552, suggesting that the cytochrome molecules that retain Q00 near 550 nm are also modified during heating. We have not further pursued this observation. The 1H NMR spectrum of oxidized p572 is unique for a cytochrome c with His-Met axial ligation, indicating an unusual electronic structure. One novel feature is that it has anomalously large shifts for the two most downfield-shifted resonances (40.3 and 41.0 ppm at 25 °C); typically, the largest shift is 35 ppm at this temperature for cytochromes c with His and Met axial ligands oriented as in p572 (74, 76) (Figure 7). Another unusual property of the p572 NMR spectrum is an unusually large spread of heme methyl resonances [> 30 ppm; compare to 20.5 ppm for rC552, a value typical of cytochromes c (76)]. The characteristics of the spectrum of oxidized p572 suggest that the electronic structure of the heme has been substantially altered relative to that of rC552 or rsC552, each of which has general features typical of cytochromes c. As the orientations of the axial ligands are conserved among these species, the unusual heme methyl shift pattern of p572 is attributed to the presence of a formyl group on the macrocycle. Electron Transfer to Cytochrome ba3. Finally, a formyl cytochrome c is expected to have significantly different electrochemical and electron transferring properties. Cytochrome c552 is the natural redox partner of cytochrome ba3 oxidase in Thermus cells grown under microaerophilic conditions (25, 77). As measured under standard assay conditions (11), the relative activities of cytochromes rsC552, rC552, and p572 toward Thermus cytochrome ba3 are 1, 0.85, and e0.1, respectively. Because it is difficult to eliminate rC552 from preparations of p572, the latter number represents an upper limit, and we suspect the activity with p572 is considerably lower. Electrochemistry Preliminary, reductive titrations of heated, as-isolated rC552 with ascorbate revealed that the 572 nm peak preceded the appearance of the 552 nm peak, suggesting that p572 may have a higher reduction potential than the remaining cytochrome c. Accordingly, we measured the reduction potential of purified p572 (trace A in Figure 6SM), an 80:20 mixture of rC552 and p572 (trace B in Figure 6SM), and native-like rsC552 (trace C in Figure 6SM) using cyclic voltammetry. The midpoint potentials (Em) derived from these voltammograms are 200 mV for rsC552 and 340 mV for p572 (vs the standard hydrogen electrode). As determined from the reduced minus oxidized optical absorption spectrum, the rC552 sample used in this experiment was an 80:20 mixture of rC552 and p572 accounting for the much broader cyclic

Sample D was purified from sample C. See Experimental Procedures for details of the recording.

strengthened C-C bonds in the ring I-cysteine 11 linkage of rC552 compared to rsC552. On the other hand, the weaker feature at 377 cm-1, attributed to a bending motion of the propionate groups, remains unchanged in all spectra, reflecting the fact that the structural variations in the heme periphery are confined to the covalent linkages with the protein. The high-frequency rR spectra of oxidized and reduced rC552 (Figure 6, traces A and B, respectively) and oxidized and reduced p572 (Figure 6, traces C and D, respectively), all obtained with 413 nm excitation, are shown in Figure 6. The rR spectra of p572 are clearly distinct from those of c552 proteins and yeast cytochrome c, reflecting the movement of the carbonyl group into the overall heme plane. The strong feature at 1645 cm-1 corresponds to a "formyl" stretch, and is known only in A-type hemes (69), the Spirographis hemes (70), and photosynthetic pigments having a formyl substituent (71). This feature confirms the presence of a formyl group and provides further support that it is conjugated and therefore coplanar with the porphyrin ring (64-68). Likewise, a weaker feature at approximately 1666 cm-1 in the spectrum of oxidized p572 is also assigned to the formyl CdO stretching mode (Figure 6, trace C, not labeled). Both the frequency decrease and intensity increase upon reduction are readily interpretable and consistent with those observed for the a3 formyl groups of cytochromes aa3 (69, 72) and ba3 (73). Indeed, the frequency of the strong 1645 cm-1 feature is low relative that of analogous A-type cytochromes (57), consistent with its position on the heme. Indeed, Tsubaki et al. (70) demonstrated that this frequency is sensitive to the formyl position on asymmetrically substituted hemes and that a formyl substituent on the C2 position of a ferrous myoglobin derivative resulted in a frequency of 1648 cm-1 compared to the frequency of 1660 cm-1 observed from a C4 formylated derivative. Thus, the 1645 cm-1 frequency is evidence of a conjugated formyl group on C2 of ring I, as supported by the crystallographic results. NMR Spectroscopy. Paramagnetically shifted heme methyl resonances reveal important details of electron spin delocalization on the porphyrin ring (74, 75). The 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra of cytochrome rsC552 and of cytochrome rC552 before and after heating, with a particular emphasis on the hyperfine-shifted resonances of the heme, are shown in Figure 7A-C. The well-resolved resonances at 34.8 and 34.2

The large positive shift in reduction potential seen for p572 is consistent with the expected effects on heme reduction potentials of carbonyl or Schiff base coupling into the porphyrin -system (32). Finally, assuming that steady state oxidase activity may be limited by the transfer of electrons from the cytochrome c to the CuA site of ba3 (240 mV), the very high potential of p572 (340 mV) accounts for its greatly reduced electron transfer activity with cytochrome ba3. DISCUSSION During synthesis in the cytoplasm of aerobically grown E. coli, cytochrome rC552 appears to bind two O atoms, thereby retaining in its molecular structure the capacity to spontaneously convert from a chromophore having a Q00 transition at 550 nm, typical of a heme having no double bonds conjugated to the porphyrin -system, to a chromophore with a formyl group that is strongly conjugated with the heme -system (p572), having a Q00 transition at 572 nm. In effect, this conversion results in the oxidation of the 2-vinyl group of iron protoporphyrin IX to [2-formyl-4-vinyl] or Spirographis heme (78). In the course of this conversion, rC552 decreases its mass by 13 ( 4 Da. This occurs by a novel mechanism involving O2 and the Cys11 residue7,8 and, by comparison to organic routes, does not involve the use of powerful and somewhat indiscriminate oxidants.9 A substantial body of data on the spectral, mass, and structural properties of rC552 and p572 supports the chemistry suggested below in Schemes 1 and 2. These data show unequivocally and without exception that (a) Cys11, the heme 2-vinyl group (on heme ring I; cf. ref 32), and presumably O28 are the primary players in an unusual chemistry, (b) a bridge of electron density in rC552 maps extends from the 2-position of the heme to the CR atom of cysteine 11 which corresponds to the presence of CO-CH2-S-CH2 atoms, (c) the plane of CO in this bridging group is approximately normal to the plane of the heme, (d) the vinyl CA-CB bond is broken in p572 and CA is oxidized to a formyl group, and (e) only one extra O atom resides in the final p572 product, presumably in the formyl group. To account for the formation of the heme-to-protein bridge in rC552, we suggest the chemistry shown in Scheme 1. This originates in a reaction of the Cys11 S atom [either as a thiolate (top) or as a thiyl radical (bottom)] with the CB atom (dCH2) of 2-vinyl. In both paths, this is followed by
7 Recently, evidence that thiolate groups can exhibit novel chemical behavior when associated with proteins has accrued, for example, unexpected disulfide formation (16), oxidation to sulfenates and sulfonates (83), involvement in the oxidation of porphyrin side chains (84), and formation of a cyclic sulfenyl amide (85). We add to this list a protein-thiol-mediated oxidation of a heme vinyl to a heme formyl substituent. 8 E. coli cells able to synthesize rC 552 when grown aerobically fail to produce any cytochrome c552 when grown anaerobically. We therefore assume that the presence of 31 ( 2 Da in the mass of rC552, obtained from aerobically grown cells, indicates the presence of two additional O atoms in the as-isolated form of this protein. 9 There are several synthetic methods for the oxidation of a ringbound vinyl group to a formyl group: KMnO4 and OsO4 (39), OsO4/ NaIO4 (86), singlet oxygen (87), and ozonolysis (88).

Fee et al.
Scheme 1

reaction of O2 with the resulting carbanion or free radical at CA which ultimately forms a hydroperoxide moeity. The antiMarkovnikov addition of RS to the 2-vinyl would generally suggest a free radical route (79), where the cysteine radical may result from spurious oxidation. However, a thiolate is also possible because improper folding of the N-terminal region against the main body of the protein may hold the S of Cys11 away from CA, and stabilization of a carbanion on CA through conjugation with the porphyrin -system could facilitate nucleophilic attack of RS- at CB of the 2-vinyl, consistent with the pH dependence of the reaction.2 Similarly, a free radical at CA may be stabilized in its sp2 configuration, thereby facilitating reaction with O2. Subsequent dehydration of the hydroperoxide to the carbonyl corresponds to a fourelectron oxidation of the vinyl group.10 Lightner et al. (80) have noted both Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov adducts in both photochemical and acid-catalyzed thiol addition to one of the vinyl groups of bilirubin.
Scheme 2

The rather speculative Scheme 2 is offered, which leads to a product consistent with the observed molecular masses, crystal structure, and spectral properties of p572. Here, the abnormal thioether loses a proton in a base-assisted process,2 forming an incipient carbanion on the C atom of cysteine 11 which, as the simplest means of cleaving the CA-CB bond of the original 2-vinyl group, we suggest, attacks the CB carbon of the erstwhile 2-vinyl group, with attendant formation of a thiirane at cysteine 11 (see refs 81 and 82 for
10 Formally, the valence of C in methane is -IV, 0 in diamond, and +IV in CO2, and the valence of the cysteine 11 S atom is maintained at (-II). If only internal oxidation and reduction occur upon conversion of rC552 to p572, CA is reduced from C(+II) to C(+I) in the formyl while C of Cys11 is oxidized from C(-I) to C(0) in the proposed thiirane (Scheme 2).

Conversion of Heme IX to Protein-Bound Spirographis Heme some discussion of the properties of these compounds) and a formyl group at the original CA atom. It is reasonable to further suggest that the driving force for this process is the coupling of the -system of the porphyrin and the formyl group. EVidence for Scheme 1. The optical and rR spectra suggest that there are no unsaturated side chains in conjugation with the porphyrin macrocycle of rC552. Thus, the Q00 transition is typical of cytochromes c, and the rR spectra indicate the core of the heme, particularly those modes composed primarily of porphyrin C-C and C-N vibrations, is highly similar in rC552 and native-like rsC552. However, the CD spectra indicate a perturbed heme environment, while the 1 H NMR spectra show clearly that the distribution of electron spin density on the porphyrin ring differs in rC552 and rsC552. The symmetry of the electronic spin distribution on the porphyrin is also clearly different between these two proteins as evidenced by the changed pattern of methyl resonances (Figure 7, traces A and B). Unfortunately, it is difficult to sort out the underlying structural differences between rC552 and native-like rsC552 from such spectra. The crystallographic results, however, indicate a structure that is consistent with the spectral observations. The electron density maps of rC552 at a resolution of 1.41 Å show clear bridging density from heme ring I to the CR atom of cysteine 11, and fixes the angle between the CA carbonyl plane and the heme plane at 70°. This seems to preclude significant coupling of the carbonyl -electrons into the heme -electron system and makes the bridge appear to the heme as a saturated side chain. Hence, the bridge does not affect the energy of the Q00 transition, but its presence alters the CD and 1H NMR spectra. The combined crystallographic and spectral data do not readily admit to other interpretations and therefore provide strong evidence for the bridge as proposed. As for the suggested chemistry, our data do not distinguish a nucleophilic from a free radical mechanism, and both seem plausible.11 Scheme 1 admits the possibility of a side reaction if the putative carbanion at CA reacts with a proton. This would yield a product having properties, including its molecular weight, similar to those of native-like cytochrome c552 (except for the somewhat different protein structure around the Cys11 position). The occurrence of this reaction may account for the observed partial conversion of rC552 to p572,2 the minor band at 14 862 Da corresponding to the molecular mass expected for the native protein (Figure 2), the unique hyperfine-shifted resonances that occur in heated rC552 but are not associated with p572 (Figure 7, trace C), and the possible appearance of electron density bridging the heme 2-position and cysteine 11 in the structure of p572 (Figure 5A). Other data from rC552, however, suggest the system may be somewhat more complicated. For example, the mass spectrum of as-isolated rC552 indicates that two additional O atoms are part of the structure, whereas the crystallographic structure of rC552 accounts for only one additional O atom. Can this be rationalized? Among several possibilities, we hypothesize that the structure of rC552, as isolated, contains
11 It is noteworthy that Carpena and co-workers (42) describe a perhydroxy group bound to the 2-vinyl CA atom in the catalaseperoxidase from Burkholderia pseudomallei.

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 38, 2004 12173 a hydroperoxide group (Scheme 1) which converts to the carbonyl at some point in the process of structure determination and is trapped in the crystal. This might explain why rC552, spectrally free of p572, always shows a significant amount of the 14 875 Da peak in its electrospray mass spectrum (see Figure 2). Current spectral results would likely not distinguish the presence of a hydroperoxide group from that of an unconjugated carbonyl. However, this idea might be tested by determining the mass of rC552 that had been subjected to the crystallographic experiment and then dissolved into buffer; crystals treated in such a manner retain their ability to convert to p572, showing that the final bridging structure, lacking the peroxy group, is still able to convert to p572. EVidence for Scheme 2. Turning to p572, we assume that the instability of rC552 with respect to p572 lies in the hemeto-cysteine 11 bridge. Knowing that a conjugated heme formyl substituent is part of p572 makes it reasonable to suggest a mechanism for the conversion of rC552 to p572. Key features of Scheme 2 are breaking of the CA-CB bond and formation of the CA carbonyl group which are strongly supported by the crystal structures. Although this is admittedly not the chemical behavior expected from an isolated molecule of R1-CO-CH2-S-CH2-CHR2 (where R1 and R2 are aliphatic), the reaction we are suggesting occurs within a protein molecule where anisotropic forces are likely to affect chemical reactivity (see below). While crystallography confirms that the bridge between heme and Cys11 is broken and that an isolated, in-plane formyl group has formed on heme ring I, it does not tell us much about what has happened to Cys11. The electron density map in this region is dominated by two large peaks for which the single cysteine 11 S atom can account, and residual positive density only indicates that additional light atoms are present, which may arise from CH2 atoms in a mixture of (R)- and (S)-thiirane. The mass spectra of p572 and its heme peptide are consistent with one extra O atom (compared to a native structure) and the loss of two to four H atoms. Thus, as measured by MALDI-TOF, the expected average mass (Mexpected) of a thiirane containing p572 heme peptide equals 2418 Da (2404 + 16 - 2), while the observed average mass (Mobs) equals 2416 ( 2.4 Da (see Table 1-SM). Although other products may fall within this mass range, whatever happens at cysteine 11 does not involve addition of other atoms. For this reason, we have rationalized Mobs in terms of a structure in which the S atom of cysteine 11 has become part of a cysteine 11 thiirane (or its mass equivalent). The appearance of the structurally distinct products would contribute to structural disorder in the region of cysteine 11. In conclusion, the results extend our knowledge of the chemistry that can occur between heme and the CXXCH motif of apocytochromes c. We are hopeful this description of cytochrome p572 may suggest more detailed study of protein-bound, formyl-containing hemes, as might occur if these can be prepared in Vitro (see refs 13, 22, and 23). Certainly, the spectral features of p572 may be useful in the analysis of mixtures of heterologously expressed cytochromes c, particularly when mutant forms are being sought (17). Finally, the new heme protein chemistry presented here may provide insight into the need for chaperone-directed heme attachment.
