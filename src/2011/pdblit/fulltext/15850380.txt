ABSTRACT: Manganese peroxidase (MnP) is an extracellular heme enzyme that catalyzes the peroxidedependent oxidation of MnII to MnIII. The MnIII is released from the enzyme in complex with oxalate. One heme propionate and the side chains of Glu35, Glu39, and Asp179 were identified as MnII ligands in the 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure. The new 1.45 Å crystal structure of MnP complexed with MnII provides a more accurate view of the Mn-binding site. New features include possible partial protonation of Glu39 in the Mn-binding site and glycosylation at Ser336. This is also the first report of MnPinhibitor complex structures. At the Mn-binding site, divalent CdII exhibits octahedral, hexacoordinate ligation geometry similar to that of MnII. CdII also binds to a putative second weak metal-binding site with tetrahedral geometry at the C-terminus of the protein. Unlike that for MnII and CdII, coordination of trivalent SmIII at the Mn-binding site is octacoordinate. SmIII was removed from a MnP-SmIII crystal by soaking the crystal in oxalate and then reintroduced into the binding site. Thus, direct comparisons of SmIII-bound and metal-free structures were made using the same crystal. No ternary complex was observed upon incubation with oxalate. The reversible binding of SmIII may be a useful model for the reversible binding of MnIII to the enzyme, which is too unstable to allow similar examination.

White-rot basidiomycetous fungi are the only organisms capable of degrading the phenylpropanoid, plant cell wall polymer, lignin (1-4). The lignin-degrading system of these fungi also can oxidize a variety of economically and environmentally important aromatic pollutants (5-9). Under ligninolytic conditions, the best-studied lignin-degrading fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, secretes two families of extracellular heme peroxidases, lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP)1 (2-4, 10), and a hydrogen peroxide-generating system (2, 4, 6). MnP from P. chrysosporium has been studied extensively by a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods (1115). The crystal structure illustrates that the heme environ This research was supported by Grants GM42614 (to T.L.P.) and DK62524 (to M.S.) from the National Institutes of Health and Grants MCB-9808420 from the National Science Foundation and DE-0396ER20235 from the Division of Energy Biosciences, U.S. Department of Energy (to M.H.G.).

ment of MnP is similar to that of other plant and fungal peroxidases (16). However, MnP is the only heme peroxidase capable of the one-electron oxidation of MnII in a typical peroxidase reaction cycle:

MnP + H2O2 f MnPI + H2O MnPI + MnII f MnPII + MnIII MnPII + MnII f MnP + MnIII + H2O

(1) (2) (3)

where MnPI and MnPII are the oxidized intermediates MnP compounds I and II, respectively. The 2.0 Å resolution crystal structure of MnP, determined at room temperature, shows that the substrate, MnII, binds to one heme propionate and the side chains of three amino acids, Glu35, Glu39, and Asp179, as well as two solvent ligands (16) (Figure 1). This site was confirmed by kinetic and biophysical studies of wild-type MnP and of proteins containing point mutations in the putative binding site.

Sundaramoorthy et al. binding (H. L. Youngs and M. H. Gold, unpublished results). Trivalent cations such as the lanthanides SmIII and EuIII also competively inhibit MnII oxidation (H. L. Youngs and M. H. Gold, unpublished results), and 1H NMR studies showed binding of CeIII and GdIII to the MnP active site (30). The stable lanthanides, therefore, have been proposed to mimic the binding of MnIII (30). While it is attractive to use these metals in functional studies of MnP, the lanthanides have a much larger mass-to-charge ratio and larger ionic radii, tend to accept more ligands, and adopt a much wider variety of ligation geometries than MnIII (33). Thus, a detailed crystallographic examination of the Mn-binding site and interaction with other metals should provide information that is useful for kinetic and biophysical studies. In this work, we present a refined wild-type MnPsubstrate model (1.45 Å cryo data set), as well structures of complexes with inhibitors CdII and SmIII (1.6 Å), and of a metal-free MnP obtained by oxalate chelation of SmIII from the SmIII-MnP complex (1.6 Å). The results presented here provide a more accurate model of native MnP at very high resolution, a structural basis for MnP inhibition with nonoxidizable metal ions, and direct structural evidence for the removal of a higher-oxidation-state metal ion from the enzyme by organic acid chelators. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification and Crystallization. Wild-type MnP was purified from shaking cultures of P. chrysosporium grown on high-carbon, low-nitrogen medium as previously described (12, 13, 19). Crystals of MnP-MnII, MnP-CdII, and MnP-SmIII were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as described previously (34). The reservoir contained 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.5). The crystallization drops were composed of 5 µL of the protein solution (10-15 mg/mL) mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution. The crystallization was initiated by a seeding procedure, using serially diluted seed stocks prepared from the old native MnP crystals. Highdilution seed stocks resulted in fewer big crystals in the protein drops, circumventing the need for macroseeding, used in our previous studies (16, 23). MnP-MnII crystals were grown with an excess of MnCl2 (4 mM) at room temperature. MnP-CdII and MnP-SmIII crystals were grown at 4 °C with an excess (4-5 mM) of CdCl2 and SmCl3, respectively, over a period of 4-8 weeks. Data Collection and Processing. Crystals were harvested in a synthetic mother liquor identical to the reservoir solution and transferred to the cryo solution containing 10% (v/v) glycerol in the mother liquor. The cryo-soaked crystals were flash-frozen in a liquid N2 stream, and all data sets were collected at -160 °C. The wild-type data set was collected using a Siemens area detector system using a rotating Siemens anode X-ray source and short Supper mirrors. The frames were integrated and merged using XENGEN (35) to obtain the 1.45 Å MNPMN data set (Table 1). The MnP-CdII and MnP-SmIII data sets were collected using an R-Axis IV imaging plate system and a Rigaku rotating anode X-ray source equipped with Yale mirrors. The data sets were integrated and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL suite (36). A single MnP-

The Fo - Fc omit map around Ser336 is contoured at 3.0 showing density for R-mannose. This is a new feature in the 1.45 Å cryo map that was not present in the 2.0 Å room-temperature structure.

Alteration of the proposed ligands in the Mn-binding site significantly affects Mn binding and oxidation (17-22), and crystals of both the single variant, D179N, and the double variant, E35Q/D179N, lack electron density at the proposed Mn-binding site (23), suggesting that MnII is not bound. MnP is unique among enzymes using manganese as a redox cofactor. Rather than permanently sequestering MnII in an interior binding site, MnP selectively binds MnII on the surface of the protein, oxidizes it, and then releases the MnIII product in complex with organic acids such as oxalate and malonate. The relatively stable MnIII-organic acid complex acts as a diffusible mediator to oxidize the terminal phenolic substrate lignin (24-26). In the absence of MnII, MnP intermediates can directly oxidize small phenolic substrates, such as guaiacol and dimethoxyphenol, but only at very slow rates, insufficient for enzyme turnover (13, 2729). Whether a MnII-chelator complex binds to the enzyme to form a ternary complex or the chelator simply facilitates release of MnIII via ligand displacement has not been completely resolved. However, the crystal structure of MnPMnII in the absence of chelators suggests that the later alternative is more likely (14, 16, 27, 30, 31). The Mn-binding site of MnP has been extensively studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Flexibility of the Mn-binding site is suggested by the multiple conformations of the ligands, Glu35 and Glu39 in both the D179N single variant and E35Q/D179N double variant crystal structures (23). However, molecular modeling and kinetic studies indicate that MnII binding and oxidation are sensitive to subtle changes in ligand geometry (17-21). These effects were studied by altering the amino acids in the active site. Competition for ligands using other metal ions is an alternative method for studying the intact binding site. Indeed, the flexibility of the Mn-binding site in MnP allows a wide variety of metal ions to bind. However, it appears that only CdII exhibits a dissociation constant similar to that of MnII (19), and other divalent cations, such as CoII (32), FeII, and ZnII, exhibit poor

CdII crystal was used to collect the MNPCD data set. Three data sets were collected with a single MnP-SmIII crystal. A long crystal was carefully cut into two pieces, and the first piece was used to collect the complete data set (MNPSM). The second piece of the same crystal was soaked in 10 mM sodium oxalate for 1 h by stepwise addition to the cryo solution. This crystal was used to collect a complete data set (MNPSMOX). The crystal was retrieved after data collection and thawed in the oxalate-free cryo solution at room temperature. Aliquots of a SmCl3 solution were subsequently added to a final concentration of 4 mM. The crystal, resoaked in SmIII, was refrozen, and a complete data set (MNPOXSM) was collected. The data collection statistics for all the data sets are given in Table 1. Refinement. Initial stages of refinement of the MnP-MnII structure were performed using XPLOR (37). The 2.0 Å room-temperature structure (PDB entry 1MNP) was used as the starting model in the refinement. Since the frozen crystal is nonisomorphous with the room-temperature crystal, rigid body refinement was carried out using 30.0-3.0 Å data, which resulted in an Rcryst of 30%. This was followed by a three-step refinement using simulated annealing at 3000 K, 120 cycles of conjugate gradient least squares (CGLS), and 20 cycles of individual B-factor refinement protocols (8.02.5 Å reflections; Rcryst ) 19%, and Rfree ) 23%). No manual model adjustment was made until this stage. As the resolution was increased beyond 2.0 Å, manual adjustments of models were made when necessary. Many branched amino acid side chains were changed to correct rotamer conformation, and multiple conformers were modeled, guided by the Fo - Fc and 2Fo - Fc maps. A new glycosylation site at Ser336 was identified, and a mannose was modeled at this site. As the resolution approached 1.45 Å, additional solvent sites and three glycerol molecules were modeled. Strong electron density persisted at two sites in the solvent region with no potential interactions with protein atoms. These sites could not be modeled with glycerol, sulfate, or cacodylate molecules present in the crystallization and cryo solutions, and were modeled as water molecules. At this stage, Rcryst and Rfree equaled 18.4 and 20.4%, respectively. When the X-PLOR refinement converged, further refinement was continued using SHELXL (38) with the intensity data, including negative intensity values. The same working and test sets of reflections used in X-PLOR were maintained in the SHELXL refinement. The SHELXL restraints for hetero groups were derived from X-PLOR restraints. The

metal-ligand distances for FeIII, CaII, and MnII, however, were not restrained. After extensive refinement using the CGLS protocol, some manual adjustment, and a more complete solvent model, Rcryst and Rfree converged to 14 and 18.6%, respectively (for Fo > 4), for isotropic B-factor refinement. Attempts to refine anisotropic B-factors were not successful. Even though the data-to-parameter ratio was slightly greater than 2, a 3% drop in Rcryst was not supported by a similar drop in Rfree, which remained virtually at the same level as in the isotropic B-factor refinement of the previous cycle. The MnP-CdII and MnP-SmIII structures were refined entirely using SHELXL. The refined wild-type MnP structure, excluding the MnII ion, was used as the starting model in all the difference Fourier calculations. The refinements were cross-validated following Rfree, using the same subset of reflections, as in the case of MnP-MnII. The appropriate metal ions, ligands, and solvent structures were remodeled using 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps calculated using respective data sets. The metal-ligand distances were not restrained during the refinement. All the model building was carried out using the TOM-FRODO map fitting graphics software (39), and figures were prepared using SETOR (40). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MnP-MnII Structure at 1.45 Å Resolution. The MnPMnII crystals, when frozen in a liquid N2 stream, diffract to significantly higher resolution than room-temperature crystals. The unit cell volume is reduced by 4% under cryo conditions, and the new unit cell dimensions are as follows: a ) 160.97 Å, b ) 45.42 Å, c ) 52.93 Å, and ) 96.9° (space group C2). A complete data set was acquired at 1.45 Å resolution using an in-house X-ray source. The 2.0 Å room-temperature model was used as the starting model for refinement against the new data. The high-resolution map (MNPMN) reveals several important structural features. When the resolution is increased beyond 1.8 Å, the electron density map reveals correct rotamer conformations for many branched amino acid side chains. Several side chains exhibit multiple conformations. The higher-resolution map also reveals ordered density for a second glycosylation site at Ser336, which was modeled as R-mannose (Figure 1). The previously identified N-glycosylation site at Asn131 shows additional electron density, which may be due to the presence of a third sugar residue. When this density is modeled as

R-mannose, it refines with high B-factors and, hence, was excluded from further refinement. At least three ordered glycerol sites were identified in the difference Fourier maps, which were occupied by water molecules in the original room-temperature structure. Despite a significant increase in resolution, small portions of the main chain and a few surface side chains are still disordered with poorly defined density. Most notably, the disordered C-terminal loop near the Mn-binding site does not show any improvement. The dynamic disorder of this loop close to the heme propionates may be associated with the accessibility of the substratebinding site. The active site is well-defined in the high-resolution maps, including a >25 density in the Fo - Fc omit map (Figure 2). All six MnII ligands are well-defined, and the metalligand distances are shorter compared to those in the 2.0 Å structure (Table 2). A new significant feature of the ligands is a peak 1.4 Å from the unliganded carboxyl oxygen of Glu39, a feature not found for the other MnII ligands. Distal residue Arg42 exhibits multiple conformations, a major one close to Glu39 and a minor one close to the distal side coordination position. The distance between OE2 of Glu39 and NH1 of Arg42 in the major conformation is 2.4 Å, and the new peak between the two atoms makes an angle of 110°, indicative of protonation of Glu39. This may be partly responsible for the reduction of net negative charge in the

Mn-binding site in the native state, and this conformation of Arg42 is termed "native". The distal arginine has been shown to move closer to the oxyferryl center to stabilize the enzyme intermediate in the crystal structure of cytochrome c peroxidase compound I (41). Hence, the minor conformation of Arg42 close to the distal side coordination position is designated as the "compound I" state. Thus, Arg42 might play two roles in MnP, stabilizing MnII binding in the native state and stabilizing the oxyferryl species in compound I, while reducing the stability of MnII/III binding for its release upon oxidation. MnP-CdII Structure. Previously, we reported the crystal structures of a D179N single mutant and an E35Q/D179N double mutant of MnP, which are deficient in MnII binding (17, 18, 23), and modeling and kinetic studies of an E39D mutant (21). These studies indicated flexibility of the Mnbinding site, as evidenced by the multiple conformations of Glu35 and Glu39. Hence, the Mn-binding site may accommodate metals with different ionic radii, provided the metals accept carboxylate ligands. The ionic radius of MnII is 0.83 Å, and that of CdII is 0.95 Å when hexacoordinated (42). There is evidence that CdII can substitute for MnII in other enzymes, such as photosystem II (43) and a MnII-dependent protein serine phosphatase (44). Similarly, CdII effectively competes with MnII in MnII-specific transport systems (4547).

FIGURE 3: (A) Stereoview of the Fo - Fc map at the Mn-binding site. The map was calculated using the MNPCD data set and the MnPMnII model without MnII. The models of both MnP-MnII (thin lines) and refined MnP-CdII (thick lines) are superimposed. The map is contoured at (3, and the positive peak is stronger than 40. (B) Stereoview of the CdII-bound structure near the Mn-binding site. The metal is still hexacoordinated, but the ligands have moved compared to those in the MnII-bound structure, notably, the two conformations of Glu39.

Previously, we reported extensive characterization of the effects of CdII on manganese peroxidase as a reversible, competitive inhibitor (19). Steady-state kinetic analysis showed that CdII is uncompetitive for H2O2 and MnP-CdII forms compound I under transient-state conditions. Cadmium cannot be oxidized by MnP intermediates and acts as a reversible, competitive inhibitor for MnII oxidation with a Ki of 10 µM. Similar changes in the MnP heme spectrum upon binding of CdII and MnII and very close apparent dissociation constants (Kd  8 µM for CdII and 10 µM for MnII) indicate that these metals bind at the same site. Finally, CdII inhibits the reduction of compounds I and II by MnII, but not by organic substrates which bind to alternate sites, suggesting specific binding of CdII at the Mn-binding site. Growth of MnP crystals in the absence of MnII is severely affected, resulting in bleaching due to possible loss of heme at room temperature as observed for MnII-free wild-type and mutant proteins (23). MnP-CdII exhibits behavior similar to that of MnII-free MnP when crystallized at low temperatures, and when grown at 4 °C, the crystals remain dark brown even though they grow slowly. The fully grown MnP-CdII crystals diffract to better than 1.6 Å resolution under cryogenic conditions. The Fo - Fc map calculated using the 1.45 Å MnP-MnII structure, excluding MnII and its ligands, revealed >40 density at the Mn-binding site (Figure 3). This site is modeled as CdII, hexacoordinated to Glu35, Glu39, Asp179, a heme propionate, and two water molecules in a manner similar to that of MnII in the MnPMnII structure (Figure 2). The ligand geometry is the same as for MnII, although the ligand distances differ slightly for

the two metals (Table 2). Another conserved feature is the hydrogen bond between Arg177 and Glu35 (20). However, Glu39 exhibits two conformations in this structure, and CdII is coordinated in both conformations. In contrast, Glu39 does not interact with Arg42 in either of the conformations. The lack of a Glu39-Arg42 interaction in the MnP-CdII structure increases the net negative charge, which might be responsible for tighter binding of CdII than of MnII. Other subtle differences in the solvent structure of MnP-CdII compared to MnP-MnII were observed. The MnP-CdII structure also exhibits a possible additional metal-binding site near the C-terminus (Figure 4). The carboxy-terminal oxygen, the side chain of Asp84, and two solvent molecules provide ligands to a second cadmium ion, displaying tetrahedral geometry. Ligands in the two metal sites, Glu39 and Asp84, are linked through hydrogen bonds mediated by Asp85 and water. This network of hydrogen bonds is possible only with the open conformation of Glu39. Although MnII is not observed to bind at this site in the crystal structures, a second, lower-affinity Mn-binding site has been postulated on the basis of pH binding analysis of the protein in solution (48). It is possible that MnII does bind to this site under physiological conditions, but not under the conditions for crystal formation (pH 6.5 in cacodylate buffer). The site is exposed to the solvent and could accommodate a MnII ion with a bound chelator such as oxalate or malonate. Alternatively, CdII may exhibit a higher affinity for this site than MnII because of its larger mass-to-charge ratio and its ability to adopt a wider range of ligation geometries (33). Atomic absorption analysis indicated only 1 equiv of CdII

The Fo - Fc omit maps were calculated omitting all atoms near the C-terminus within a sphere with a radius of 5 Å, including Ala357 and Asp84. The density is contoured at 3 for MnP-MnII (A) and MnP-SmIII (C) and 3 and 20 for MnP-CdII (B).

binding per mole of protein in solution, possibly due to partial occupation of both sites by this metal at pH 4.5 (19). MnP-SmIII and Metal-Free MnP Structures. Like MnPCdII crystals, MnP-SmIII crystals were grown at 4 °C and diffract to 1.6 Å under cryo conditions. Three data sets were collected using a single crystal (Table 1). The first data set (MNPSM) collected with the first half of the crystal exhibited >35  density at the Mn-binding site in the Fo - Fc map calculated using the MnP-MnII coordinates, excluding MnII and its ligands (Figure 5A). The site was modeled with a SmIII ion, and the structure was refined (Table 1). Unlike the MnP-MnII and MnP-CdII structures, the metal site in MnP-SmIII is coordinated with eight ligands (Table 2 and Figure 5A). All four carboxylate ligands are retained, and there are four solvent ligands, two more than for MnII and CdII, which is consistent for the coordination geometry of SmIII. The longer average metal-ligand distance in this structure compared to those in MnP-MnII and MnP-CdII also supports the presence of SmIII with an ionic radius of 1.08 Å in the octacoordinate state (42). The side chains of Glu39 and Arg42 are in only one conformation with the former in an open conformation and the latter in its compound I conformation. The solvent structure differs near the metal-binding site, and there is no second metal binding near the C-terminus as observed in MnP-CdII structure. The second data set (MNPSMOX) was collected using the second piece of the MnP-SmIII crystal after it had soaked in the mother liquor containing 10 mM sodium oxalate for several hours. The Fo - Fc map of this data set using MnPMnII coordinates, lacking MnII and its ligands, differs from that described for MNPSM. Most significantly, the density is weak at the metal-binding site (Figure 5B) and the C-terminal region of the polypeptide chain. There are only four interactions possible for this peak (Table 2 and Figure 5B). Two of the four carboxylates, Glu35 and Glu39, are oriented away from the metal-binding site with distances of 3.47 and 3.57 Å, respectively. This is very similar to the situation observed in the structure of the D179N mutant, which lacks a metal ion (23). Soaking the crystal in a sodium oxalate solution resulted in the removal of bound SmIII; the site is then occupied by either a water molecule or a sodium ion. No ternary complex containing oxalate was observed. These observations are consistent with 1H NMR data for MnP-lanthanide complexes incubated with oxalate (30).

Our observations suggest that the SmIII ion in the oxalatesoaked crystal is removed from the active site by oxalate chelation. To test this possibility, we attempted to resubstitute SmIII in the crystal used to collect the MNPSMOX data set. The crystal was retrieved and thawed in the mother liquor (MnP crystals are very stable and can withstand a few cycles of freeze-thaw treatment). Small aliquots of the SmCl3 solution were slowly added until the final concentration reached 5 mM. The crystal was soaked for several hours and flash-frozen, and a new 1.7 Å data set (MNPOXSM) was collected. Previous exposure of the crystal to X-rays and the freeze-thaw treatment caused a small deterioration, resulting in a higher mosaic content and lower resolution. Nevertheless, the Fo - Fc omit map of this data set exhibited features similar to those observed in the MNPSM map, indicating the resubstitution of SmIII in the metal-binding site with >30 density at the Mn-binding site (Table 2 and Figure 5C). Thus, removal of SmIII from the Mn-binding site was accomplished without the formation of a discernible ternary complex containing oxalate. Replacement of the metal in the site indicated that no permanent alteration in the site was caused by the treatment. These results suggest reversible binding of the free MnII substrate to the enzyme and the role of chelators in the release of the MnIII product during MnP turnover confirming earlier work (14). The direct observation of MnII, CdII, and SmIII binding in the crystal structure indicates that the Mn-binding site is able to bind reversibly both divalent and trivalent cations with sufficiently high affinity, in accordance with inhibition and 1 H NMR studies (30) (H. L. Youngs, data not shown). MnII is not released in the presence of oxalate, as the Mn-binding site is indistinguishable in oxalate-free and oxalate-soaked MnP-MnII structures (data not shown), suggesting that no ternary MnP-MnII-oxalate complex is formed and the unchelated MnII binds to the enzyme. However, the observation that SmIII can be removed from MnP by oxalate suggests that MnIII can be similarly chelated, consistent with kinetic studies (14) and the 1H NMR study of MnP complexes with GdIII and CsIII (30). However, no ternary MnP-SmIII-oxalate complex was observed in the crystal structure. While lanthanides may mimic the charge of MnIII, they are quite different in size (33) and, as we present here, coordination preference. Thus, any conclusions regarding Mn chemistry based on metal substitutions are tentative. If such a ternary

FIGURE 5: (A) Stereoview of the Fo - Fc map at the Mn-binding site (top). The map was calculated using the MNPSM data set and the MnP-MnII model without MnII. The models of both MnP-MnII (thin lines) and refined MnP-SmIII (thick lines) are superimposed. The map is contoured at (3, and the positive peak is stronger than 35. Stereoview of the SmIII-bound structure near the Mn-binding site (bottom). The metal is still octacoordinated, with two additional water ligands. There is rearrangement of some protein side chain ligands, but all are in a single conformation. (B) Stereoview of the Fo - Fc map at the Mn-binding site (top). The map was calculated using the MNPSMOX (MnP-SmIII crystal treated with oxalate) data set and the MnP-MnII model without MnII. The models of both MnP-MnII (thin lines) and refined metal-free MnP (thick lines) are superimposed. The map is contoured at (3, and the positive peak at the Mnbinding site is 6, indicating that the site lacks metal. Stereoview of the metal-free structure near the Mn-binding site (bottom). The peak at the Mn-binding site shows only four interactions, two amino acid side chains and two waters. This site is also modeled as water (W0). There is a major rearrangement of protein side chain ligands due to lack of metal, which is reminiscent of the active site mutant structures lacking MnII (21, 23). (C) Stereoview of the Fo - Fc map at the Mn-binding site. The map was calculated using the MNPOXSM data set and the MnP-MnII model without MnII. The models of both MnP-MnII (thin lines) and refined SmIII-resubstituted MnP (the oxalatetreated crystal MnP resoaked in SmIII; thick lines) are superimposed. The map is contoured at (3, and the positive peak is stronger than 30, indicating rebinding of SmIII. This is also supported by octacoordination of the site with the same ligation as in the MnP-SmIII structure refined with the MNPSM data set. The X's in the various diagrams represent solvent molecules.
