Comparative structural studies on proteins derived from organisms with growth optima ranging from 15 to 100  C are beginning to shed light on the mechanisms of protein thermoadaptation. One means of sustaining hyperthermostability is for proteins to exist in higher oligomeric forms than their mesophilic homologues. Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) is one of the most studied enzymes, whose fold represents one of nature's most common protein architectures. Most TIMs are dimers of approxiÊ mately 250 amino acid residues per monomer. Here, we report the 2.7 A resolution crystal structure of the extremely thermostable TIM from Pyrococcus woesei, a hyperthermophilic archaeon growing optimally at 100  C, representing the ®rst archaeal TIM structure. P. woesei TIM exists as a tetramer comprising monomers of only 228 amino acid residues. Structural comparisons with other less thermostable TIMs show that although the central b-barrel is largely conserved, severe pruning of several helices and truncation of some loops give rise to a much more compact monomer in the small hyperthermophilic TIM. The classical TIM dimer formation is conserved in P. woesei TIM. The extreme thermostability of PwTIM appears to be achieved by the creation of a compact tetramer where two classical TIM dimers interact via an extensive hydrophobic interface. The tetramer is formed through largely hydrophobic interactions between some of the pruned helical regions. The equivalent helical regions in less thermostable dimeric TIMs represent regions of high average temperature factor. The PwTIM seems to have removed these regions of potential instability in the formation of the tetramer. This study of PwTIM provides further support for the role of higher oligomerisation states in extreme thermal stabilisation.

family of proteins.1 Attempts to identify the molecular basis of this enhanced thermostability have focussed mainly on comparative analyses of threedimensional structures of proteins from the same family but from organisms that exhibit different optimal growth temperatures.1 ± 6 Through these comparative studies it is becoming clear that different protein families achieve thermoadaptation through different structural means. There is no one de®ning feature of thermostability, rather an amalgamation of small, varied forces confer the enhanced stability. Such forces include an increase in subunit contacts, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, more ef®cient packing, shorter loops and fewer cavities.

A recent study4 compared the structure of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM; EC 5.3.1.1) isolated from organisms across a temperature range of 15  C-80  C, and identi®ed features of thermostability. This analysis can now be extended to 100  C with the crystal structure of Pyrococcus woesei TIM reported here. TIM makes a particularly good candidate for this comparative study, as there is at least one representative from psychrophilic, thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms. TIM, which is usually a dimeric enzyme, catalyses the interconversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during glycolysis.12 Its glycolytic role ensures it is ubiquitous and conserved in function across all three domains of life; Eucarya, Bacteria and Archaea. All TIM structures so far determined comprise approximately 250 amino acid residues per monomer, and function as homodimers. Each TIM monomer consists of an eightfold repeat of a

b-strand-loop-a-helix-loop motif, which folds up to form a (b/a)8 barrel with the eight b-strands forming the core of the barrel, surrounded by the eight a-helices (Figure 1). The dimer interface occurs mainly across loops 1, 2, 3 and 4 (where loop n is the loop connecting bn to an), and the catalytic residues are located on loops 1, 4 and 6. Substratebinding induces a conformational change in loops 5, 6 and 7 going from the open (unliganded) state to the closed (liganded) conformation.13 There are currently ten TIM structures in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) and a previous study compared all ten.4 In the following comparison, only one mesophilic structure is included throughout, although a structural alignment of all 11 TIM structures is included for reference (Figure 2). The yeast TIM structure (YeTIM)14 has been chosen because it is in the closed conformation, in both subunits. The extremophilic representatives are also in the closed conformation, and are from the psychrophilic bacterium Vibrio marinus (VmTIM),15 which has optimum growth at 15  C, the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus (BsTIM),16 which is a moderate thermophile with an optimum growth temperature of 65  C, and the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (TmTIM),4 optimal temperature 80  C. The latter TIM structure is an anomaly, as it exists as a bifunctional fusion protein within the organism itself, with the N terminus of TmTIM covalently linked to the C terminus of phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK).17 The wild-type protein is a tetramer consisting of four PGK-TIM chains. The TmTIM structure described is derived from an engineered TmTIM separated from the PGK, still retaining high intrinsic thermostability, but with slightly lower catalytic ef®ciency at elevated temperatures.18 The crystal structure of the separate TIM enzyme is tetrameric, but with disul-

phide bonds linking dimers of classical TIM dimers. Here, we present the ®rst archaeal TIM structure, isolated from the hyperthermophile P. woesei (PwTIM); an extreme thermophile with an optimal growth temperature of 100  C. The thermostability of the protein itself is con®rmed by it having a half-life of inactivation of 1775 minutes at 100  C.19 PwTIM is of particular interest, as it exists as an independent non-covalently linked homotetramer as both the wild-type and recombinant enzymes,20 and strikingly has a

monomeric sequence length of only 228 amino acid residues, making it 20 residues shorter than any of the structurally described TIMs. To date, all known bacterial and eukaryal TIM sequences have more than 245 residues per monomer and, with the exception of the T. maritima TIM, are homodimers. The mesophilic archaeon, Methanobacterium bryantii also has the shorter sequence (226 residues), but forms a homodimer not a homotetramer,20 thus suggesting a correlation between oligomerisation and thermoadaptation.

Structure of Pyrococcus woesei TIM

Results
The structure of P. woesei TIM was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) methods and cross-crystal averaging to Ê produce a model that has been re®ned at 2.7 A resolution with an R-factor of 25.4 % and a free R-factor of 28.6 %, and with good geometry (see Table 6). There are eight monomers in the asymmetric unit arranged as two homotetramers, named ABCD and EFGH. Each tetramer is assembled as a dimer of classical TIM dimers, AB and CD in one tetramer, EF and GH in the other. The protein was co-crystallised with the substrate analogue 2-carboxyethylphosphonic acid (2-CP) which is present in each monomer and therefore all monomers are in the closed conformation.

Monomeric structure Each subunit of P. woesei TIM displays the same fold as the other TIMs. Figure 2 shows a structural alignment of all 11 TIMs. The recent TIM study4 compared the framework helices of all the ten TIMs then available, and found the rmsd values between the C-alpha atoms of any two TIMs to Ê vary from 0.4-1.4 A. P. woesei TIM has rmsd values with the four others in this comparison ranging Ê from 1.72-1.82 A (Table 1). The biggest difference is between PwTIM and VmTIM, with gradually decreasing rmsd values as thermostability increases. Pairwise sequence alignments of the ®ve TIMs show no trends in sequence identities with increasing thermal stability: the less thermostable TIMs having approximately 50 % identity with

749 loop (loop 3). Although neither of these networks is unique to PwTIM, the other TIMs have only one of these networks, but not both. In this region there appears to be a strong intramolecular ionic network, while the hydrophobic residues of helix 4 and the preceding loop form part of the interface of the two dimers. See later for further discussion of ion pairs and ion-pair networks. Helix 5 The largest difference between PwTIM and all the others occurs at helix 5 (Figure 3). PwTIM has a much shorter helix 5 with a large deletion of approximately 20 residues. Helix 5 is normally composed of a short helix (5a) and a loop followed by a longer helix (5b). VmTIM helix 5a comprises a short (®ve residues) helix followed by a loop of three residues, with helix 5b being 16 residues long. In the mesophiles, the same pattern exists, a ®ve residue helix, three residue loop and a 10-16 residue helix. BsTIM and TmTIM differ in that helix 5a is six residues long, while the loop is only two residues long, and helix 5b is 13 residues in each of these thermophilic TIMs. In contrast, PwTIM has one unbroken helix of only eight residues (127-134) which consists almost entirely of hydrophobic residues, PAVSAAVA, and it is this area that forms most of the dimer/dimer interface through interactions with helix 4. In the other TIMs, helix 5 has a very low alanine content, and is not primarily hydrophobic, including the hyperthermostable TmTIM tetramer. Helix 6 In most of the TIMs, helix 6 is formed from a three residue helix 6a, followed by a loop and a longer helix 6b. Helix 6b in PwTIM at 13 residues is much shorter than in any other TIM. VmTIM has a 22 residue helix 6b, YeTIM has 25 residues, and is typical of the mesophilic TIMs, BsTIM and TmTIM both have 24 residues. The C-terminal end of helix 6b in PwTIM is involved in the tetramer association (Val173 from each subunit), and most of the surface-exposed residues along helix 6 are charged (Glu168, Lys171 and Lys172). N terminus The N termini of the less thermostable TIMs all point towards helix 7 on the outside of the barrel. However, Lys3 at the N terminus of PwTIM points back into the core of the barrel and forms an ionic interaction with Asp139 of the loop following the truncated helix 5. This interaction ®xes the N terminus to the core of the protein and has been observed in other (b/a)8-barrel proteins.22 Dimer association The formation of the classical, functional TIM dimer is highly similar across all the TIMs. There is

each other, and the archaeal PwTIM sequence having identities ranging only from 21.6 % with YeTIM to 24.2 % with VmTIM, due to its more remote phylogenetic position. Despite the lack of sequence identity, there is no signi®cant difference in the level of secondary structure in each TIM. The dimeric TIM structures are all very similar, with all the b-strands being highly superimposable (Figure 3). However, differences in secondary structure exist between PwTIM and the less thermostable bacterial and eukaryal TIMs; although the b-strands show a high level of similarity, the a-helices and loops are more divergent. Signi®cant differences are discussed below. Helix 1 Helix 1 of PwTIM is of a length comparable to that of YeTIM, VmTIM, BsTIM and TmTIM, and all the other mesophilic TIMs, but is shifted closer to b2 than in any of the other TIMs (Figure 3). In PwTIM, the residues on the helix, facing the core of the enzyme and interacting with residues in b2 and loop 2 are all hydrophobic (Ala24, Ala28, Ala31 and Tyr35). The alanine content of helix 1 from PwTIM is 25 % compared to 7.1 % in VmTIM, and TmTIM, and 18.2 % in BsTIM. There is no alanine residue in helix 1 of YeTIM although two of the mesophilic TIMs (chicken and human) do have one alanine residue. The surface-exposed residues of helix 1 from PwTIM are all charged. The other TIMs do have some charged residues on the exposed surface, but they also have at least one uncharged polar residue (Gln, Asn or Ser). Gln and Asn are susceptible to deamidation at higher temperatures 2,21 and PwTIM helix 1 does not contain either of these residues. The loop following helix 1 is shortest in PwTIM (four residues). The psychrophilic VmTIM loop consists of seven residues, YeTIM has six, the moderately thermophilic BsTIM has ten, and the hyperthermophilic TmTIM has seven. Therefore, there is no correlation of loop length with increasing thermostability, but the shortening of the loop may allow more ef®cient packing in the hydrophobic core of the hyperthermostable PwTIM. Helix 4 Helix 4 is composed of one short helix followed by a loop, then a longer helix (Figure 3). The second part of PwTIM helix 4 is again alanine-rich (28.6 % alanine), with the alanine residues pointing away from the core of the monomer, participating in the interface of the tetramer. It is not signi®cantly more alanine-rich than some of the mesophilic TIMs. The other side of the helix, this time pointing towards the core of the barrel, consists mainly of charged residues (Asp105, Glu107, Arg111, Arg112, Glu114 and Glu115). Glu107 forms an intramolecular ion-pair with Arg111, which also forms an ion pair with Glu114. Glu115 pairs with Arg112 and with Lys71 in the interface

no increase in the number of ion pairs across the dimer interface, no increase in the number of interface residues or interface accessible surface area and no difference in the number of hydrogen bonds across the temperature spectrum. As can be seen in Figure 3, the areas involved in the dimer interface are highly superimposable. However, calculation of the solvent-exposed surface area of the monomers and subsequent burial of residues upon dimerisation shows that while the less thermostable TIMs achieve stability of the dimer through burial of hydrophobic residues, the PwTIM dimerisation does not (Table 2). PwTIM shows no change in the level of hydrophobic surface area exposed on formation of the dimer. However, the formation of the TmTIM tetramer is not achieved through further burial of hydrophobic residues (18 % of the exposed surface area in the tetramer is hydrophobic), while the PwTIM tetramerisation involves burial of a signi®cant proportion of hydrophobic surface area: tetramerisation decreases the amount of hydrophobic exposed surface area from 27.4 % to 22.7 %. Tetrameric association The PwTIM tetramer is arranged as a dimer of dimers (Figure 4), and is stabilised by hydrophobic interactions involving residues in helices 4 and 5 and the loops linking them. There is no evidence of close-range interactions of charged residues across this region. In contrast, the TmTIM tetramer is held together by two disulphide bridges stabilised with four salt-bridges. In PwTIM, the tetramer interface is formed through interactions of helix 4 of one monomer with helix 5 of the opposite monomer. Monomers A and C form one interface, while B and D form the other interface. The contacts between each monomer are listed in Table 3, with an additional hydrophobic contact between Ê Val173 of each subunit (closest distance of 4.5 A). Ê There is also a weak ion-pair (5 A) between Arg100A of the loop preceding helix 4 and Asp105C within helix 4. The PwTIM monomer is much smaller than any of the other TIMs (Table 1). There is no correlation with the size of either the separate subunits or the oligomers with increasing thermostability; PwTIM is the only outlier. Analysis of the proportion of each subunit involved in

tetramerisation reveals that the amount of accessible surface area buried upon association of the two Ê dimers is 700 A2, which is 7.6 % of each monomer, and of which 69 % is hydrophobic. In contrast, the TmTIM tetramer has only 4.6 % of each monomer buried upon tetramerisation, 58 % of which is hydrophobic, with a total buried surface area of Ê 550 A2. This comparison indicates a closer, more intimate tetrameric association of the PwTIM than of the TmTIM, which is illustrated in Figure 5. B-Factors In other TIMs, helix 5a and its following loop seem to show high ¯exibility relative to the rest of the structure, and it is the region that is absent in PwTIM. In each of the mesophilic TIMs, the average B-factor across this region (from the conserved glycine residue after b5 to the conserved threonine residue of helix 5b) is higher than the average B-factor of the whole monomer (Table 1). One exception is chicken TIM, which has an average B-factor in this region that is the same as the average B-factor of the whole monomer, although the values do vary dramatically in this region up to Ê 80 A2. This region of the chicken structure shows close contacts with a symmetry-related molecule, therefore the area may be stabilised due to crystal packing. VmTIM also shows great mobility in this region, with an average B-factor that is 2.5 times the overall average B-factor. In PwTIM, the whole of helix 5 and the preceding loop have an average Ê Ê B-factor of 14 A2, with a maximum value of 23 A2, indicative of the involvement of these residues at the tetramer interface. Electrostatic interactions The only TIM that shows a signi®cantly higher number of ion pairs is the hyperthermostable TmTIM, but any trend breaks down with the inclusion of the even more hyperthermophilic PwTIM. VmTIM also shows a slightly increased number of ion pairs. There is also no increase in the number of charged residues with increasing thermostability. One other point of note is the lack of an apparently ``conserved'' salt-bridge. In all the other TIMs a salt-bridge is formed via Arg192 (in TmTIM) of helix 6 with Asp228 and/or Asp230 of

751 Lys71, Glu115 and Arg112. These intramolecular networks occur at the point of tetramer association, with all the charged residues pointing back in towards the core of the monomer. A ®nal unique pair occurs between Glu147 and Lys159 in PwTIM. The glutamate residue is part of the three residue helix at the start of helix 6, which in the less thermostable TIMs comprises a VWA, LWA, or IWA motif, while the PwTIM helix is PEL. The lysine residue is part of the loop preceding helix 6b, so the ion pair results in tethering the two sections of helix 6 together. Cavities In accordance with the previous TIM study,4 no differences were found in the number, volume or hydrophobicity of cavities between the TIMs that could be correlated with thermostability. There is variation in the number and size of cavities across all of the mesophilic TIMs, making it unlikely that the ®lling of cavities is involved in the stabilisation of this particular enzyme. This may be due to the compact, hydrophobic nature of the TIM-barrel folds, as all the TIMs have small cavities.

Discussion
Through the comparative analyses of TIM structures representing psychrophilic, mesophilic, moderately thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms, it is dif®cult to isolate trends of features involved in conferring thermostability. Certainly the most obvious difference is in the formation of a tetramer in TmTIM and PwTIM when the less thermostable TIMs are all dimers. The increased intersubunit contacts could be responsible for the increased thermostability, and this tendency towards higher oligomers as a thermostabilising feature has been observed in other protein families.1 3-Phosphoglycerate kinase is dimeric in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanothermus fervidus and P. woesei, but monomeric in mesophiles.23 Dihydrofolate reductase, which is monomeric in mesophilic organisms forms a dimer in the hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima.6 Ornithine carbamoyltransferase exists as a trimer in mesophiles but oligomerises to give four trimers in the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus.24 Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase is trimeric in the hyperthermophile Methanopyrus kandleri, but is dimeric in mesophilic hosts.25 The extent of the hydrophobic interaction across the tetramer interface correlates well with the general observation that increased hydrophobicity increases stability. Recent examples include the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophile Methanothermus fervidus, which has more hydrophobic contacts than its mesophilic counterparts, facilitated by additional a-helices,26 and the alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter brockii, which has more hydro-

the loop preceding b8. This salt-bridge serves to Ê tether helices 6 and 7 to each other, some 20 A 4 away from the active site. In PwTIM there is no charged residue in the loop preceding b8 and the conserved arginine is absent. Although PwTIM does not have more ion pairs or ion-pair networks than any other TIM, it does have some unique interactions. The ion pair between the N terminus and the C-terminal end of helix 5 (Lys3 and Asp139) is not found in the other TIMs. There is a further unique anchoring of the N terminus through an ion pair between Glu6 and Lys178 of loop 7. Additionally, there is a short insert before helix 1 leading to the formation of an intramolecular ion pair between Glu18 and Lys210, tethering loop 1 and loop 8 together. There is an increase in ionic interactions between the two sections of helix 4 and the interface loop. VmTIM, YeTIM, BsTIM and TmTIM have an ion-pair network of Arg100, Glu106 and Lys114, and in PwTIM a similar network occurs between Glu107, Arg111 and Glu114, and this region is further stabilised by the formation of a second ion-pair network between

phobic interactions at subunit interfaces than its mesophilic homologues, and a more hydrophobic interior in each subunit.27 The increase in the number of alanine residues incorporated into some of the PwTIM helices could lead to greater stability within the structure: alanine is helix-stabilising, and an increase in alanine content in helices is a factor that has been seen before in thermophilic proteins.28 ± 30 Further, the localised increase in alanine content in helices 4 and 5 is clearly responsible for much of the hydrophobic contact between the two dimers. The increased compactness of the PwTIM, evident from the volume occupied by the subunits, may also confer stability. This compactness is achieved through the shortening of some of the loops, and through truncation of helices 5 and 6. The increased mobility of loop 5 and part of helix 5 in the psychrophilic and mesophilic bacterial and eukaryal TIMs may indicate a weak point in the TIM structure that may be susceptible to unfolding at high temperatures. At the higher temperature of

100  C at which PwTIM must function, the removal of this mobile region could prevent local unfolding of the peptide chain at that weak link thus leading to a kinetic hindrance of denaturation. However, as the mesophilic M. bryantii TIM exhibits gaps of the same size and at the same positions,31 these shortenings in PwTIM certainly do not represent the only structural prerequisites for higher oligomerisation states and higher thermostability. They are at best a necessary but not suf®cient prerequisite of the enzyme's thermophilic phenotype. The contribution of electrostatic interactions to thermostability has been well documented.5,7,9 However in PwTIM, there does not seem to be a straightforward increase in the number of ion pairs, clusters or even charged residues. Rather, there are speci®c locations where electrostatic interactions result in anchoring parts of each subunit. The difference in the conformation of the N terminus in PwTIM appears to be in order to tether the N terminus to the truncated helix 5; the extra ionpair network within helix 6 and the altogether

Cryoprotection of the crystals was achieved through equilibration against mother liquor containing 25 % (w/v) glycerol and data were collected at 100 K. Three wavelengths were selected for data collection corresponding to the maximum fHH (peak) , the minimum fH (edge), and a reference wavelength (remote). Data were Ê collected from a single crystal to 3.0 A, and were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK.34 Details of the data collection statistics are given in Table 4.

FOM, ®gure of merit.

Structure solution The selenium structure was determined by the MAD method using version 1.15 of the program SOLVE.35 Estimates of the solvent content of the crystal suggested there was one tetramer present in the asymmetric unit. The published sequence of P. woesei TIM20 revealed six methionine residues per monomer, including the Nterminal methionine residue, which is cleaved on production of the mature protein. Therefore, 20 selenium atoms were expected in the SeMet derivative. The Patterson analysis found all 20 of the selenium sites expected. The successful selenium solution had a ®gure of merit of Ê 0.55 at 3.0 A. Sixteen of the Se sites had peak heights of around 20 s, while the last four were 6 s. The phase estimates from SOLVE were then used to calculate a solvent-¯attened electron density map with DM,36 as implemented in the CCP4 program suite,37 which was clearly interpretable. FINDNCS38 was then used to calculate all possible Se sites within the maximum cell and non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators between the four monomers were determined by estimating symmetry-related Se sites assuming a 222 relationship of the tetramer as identi®ed by the self-rotation function.32 A mask was generated from the experimental bones using NCSMASK, and full NCS averaging across the tetramer was performed in DM. The initial correlation between the monomers was about 0.51 in DM. The ®gure of merit Ê (FOM) was 0.69 to 3 A after averaging. A partial polyalanine model was constructed with the Ê program O39 using the SeMet data to 3.0 A. The polyalanine model was used as a molecular replacement phasing Ê model for the 2.7 A monoclinic native data using the program AMoRe.40 Using the powerful technique of crosscrystal averaging in DMMULTI, the NCS operators between the 12 monomers (one tetramer in the orthorhombic SeMet derivative, two tetramers in the monoclinic Ê native crystal), the phases were extended to 2.7 A. The correlation between all 12 monomers after cross-crystal Ê averaging was 0.93, and the FOM to 2.7 A was 0.92. The DM free R-factor in crystal 1 (orthorhombic) dropped from 74 % to 29 %, while in crystal 2 the free R went from 74 % to 40 %. This averaging greatly improved the electron density maps, and the rest of the model was built using the higher-resolution monoclinic data.

altered position of helix 6 seem to allow the conformational twist brought about by the tetramer association. In PwTIM therefore, electrostatic interactions may play an indirect role in stabilising the regions involved in the predominantly hydrophobic tetramer association. Altogether, the study of the 3D structure of PwTIM con®rms the trend of higher oligomerisation in hyperthermophilic enzymes and focuses attention on the effects of rather subtle structural changes on the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of proteins.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of selenomethionine derivative Preliminary crystallographic studies of P. woesei TIM have been described.32 The best native data were colÊ lected at 100 K to 2.7 A from a monoclinic crystal form Ê Ê Ê (a  79.0 A, b  89.1 A, c  145.2 A, a  g  90  ,  b  92.8 ) that contains two TIM tetramers per asymmetric unit related by a pseudo-centring. Numerous attempts at molecular replacement failed to provide a solution, therefore selenomethionine labelling of the protein was carried out. To produce SeMet-substituted TIM, the methionine auxotrophic Escherichia coli B834(DE3) strain was transformed with the pET15b-TIM expression plasmid and grown in basic medium containing Lselenomethionine.33 Cells were grown at 37  C to A600  0.5, induced with 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and grown at 37  C for a further 24 hours. The puri®cation procedure was as for the native protein, except that all buffers contained 5 mM dithiothreitol. The crystallisation conditions were slightly different, with crystals grown by co-crystallisation of 10 mg/ml SeMet-TIM with 20 mM 2-carboxyethylphosphonic acid (2-CP), and with 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 10 % (w/v) PEG 4000 as the precipitant buffer. The hanging-drop vapour diffusion technique was used,

Structure of Pyrococcus woesei TIM Structure refinement Unequivocal sequence assignment began with Met119 and Met121, and from there approximately 60 % of the sequence was assigned, including Met53 and Met101. However, the ®nal methionine residue (Met218) could not be reconciled with the model and position in the sequence. The P. woesei TIM sequence was then aligned with the TIM sequence from the closely related organism, Pyrococcus horikoshii41 and the two sequences were found to be almost identical apart from the C-terminal 18 residues. Subsequent re-sequencing of the P. woesei tim gene revealed that there were only four methionine residues per monomer (excluding the N-terminal Met), and the extra four ``Se'' sites located corresponded to sulphur sites in a Cys residue. The correct sequence is 228 residues long. Once the correct sequence was obtained, the rest of the traceable density was assigned sequence. There was clear density for all eight b-strands, and six of the a-helices, but the density was not clear for helices 6 and 8. This near-complete model was then re®ned, with tight NCS restraints across the eight monomers in the asymmetric unit, using the Crystallography and NMR Ê System (CNS).42 All data from 30.0-2.7 A were used in re®nement with a random subset of data (10 %) which were omitted from all re®nement calculations for crossvalidation. Re®nement consisted of several rounds of simulated annealing, followed by manual rebuilding in O, resulting in the free R-factor dropping from 58 % to 38 % after three rounds. SIGMAA weighted 2Fo À Fc maps were then generated and the rest of the model was built. Further rounds of energy minimisation and B-factor re®nement with NCS restraints maintained resulted in a ®nal R-factor of 25.4 % and Rfree of 28.6 %. The ®nal model still lacks the C-terminal two residues, Lys227 and Glu228, as there was no de®ned density in this region. Validation by PROCHECK43 revealed good stereochemistry with the Ramachandran plot showing 98.5 % of residues in the core and allowed regions, and 1.5 % in generously allowed regions. These 1.5 % correspond to the catalytic Lys14 of each subunit, which are in a strained conformation in each TIM structure. See Table 5 for phasing, re®nement and model statistics.

Structural analysis All 11 TIM structures were superimposed on the basis of the three conserved catalytic residues initially and improved to extend across as many Ca atoms as possible using the lsq option in O.39 The structural alignment was made by creating an initial sequence alignment using the Pileup in the GCG package44 followed by secondary structure prediction with the DSSP software.45 The sequence alignment was then adjusted manually to concur with the structurally equivalent residues in all the TIMs. Molecular volumes, cavities and exposed surface areas were calculated using the program GRASP.46 Hydrogen bonds between protein atoms were calculated using the HBPLUS47 software with the default parameters for distances and angles. Ion pairs were assigned when atoms of opposite charge were found Ê within 4 A of each other,48 although longer-range interactions were considered in the PwTIM structure, but not for the overall comparisons. Interface accessible surface area was calculated through the Protein-Protein Interaction49 server using a Ê probe radius of 1.4 A.
