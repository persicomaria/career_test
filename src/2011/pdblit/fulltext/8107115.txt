Inhibitor-complexed crystals of mouse and human renins suitable for X-ray analysis have been prepared. The mouse renin is complexed with a non-hydrolysable decapeptide analogue of rat angiotensinogen containing a hydroxyethylene isostere in place of the scissile bond. The crystals are monoclinic, space group P2, with cell dimensions a= 78.3 8, b= 117.8 8, c= 85.9 8, /I= 101*18" containing four molecules per asymmetric unit. The human renin is fully glycosylated and complexed with a tetrapeptide containing norstatine. The complex crystallises in the cubic space group P2,3 with a= 143.1 a and has two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The rotation function of the mouse renin complex indicates pseudo 222 symmetry while that of human renin indicates a pseudo 2-fold axis. Full structural analyses of the two complexes are underway.

is an important member of the family of proteinases. It is the key enzyme of the whom all correspondence should be

to

renin-angiotensinogen-aldosterone cascade that plays a c&cial roll in the regulation of electrolyte balance and blood pressure (Reid et al., 1978; Skeggs et al., 1980). The exquisite specificity of human renin which cleaves the Leu-Val bond of angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I makes it an attractive target for anti-hypertensive drug design.

Renin shows significant homology to gastric, fungal and retroviral aspartic proteinases, several of whose structures are known (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1990; Andreeva et al., 1984, 1985; Blundell et al., 1985, 1990; Bott et al., 1982; Cooper et al., 1990; Gilliland et al., 1990; Hartsuck & Remington, 1988; James et al., 1988; James & Sielecki, 1983; Lapatto et al., 1989; Newman et al.; 1991; Sielecki et al., 1989; Strop et al., 1990; Suguna et al., 1987; Watson et al., 1988). The striking similarity in the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes suggests that they might have a common ancestral origin (Tang et al., 1978; Tang & Wong, 1987). However, due to divergent evolution, they have developed different specificities suited to their biological function. The aspartic proteinase active site lies along a deep groove nearly bisecting the molecule into almost symmetric C and N-terminal lobes, and is long enough to accommodate about eight residues of a polypeptide substrate. The side-chain carboxyl groups of the two catalytic aspartate residues (32 and 215 by pepsin numbering) are located close to each other and to the scissilebond of the substrate. The residues on either side of the t'wo aspartate residues are highly conserved and are involved in an intricate network of hydrogen bonds forming the "Jireman's grip" (Pearl & Blundell, 1984), which preserves the active site geometry. On the basis of homology of renin with the other aspartic proteinases, molecular modelling approaches along with techniques have been energy minimization employed (Sibanda et al., 1984; Hemmings et al., 1985) to arrive at the most probable structure from the known sequence. Early work (Bott et al., 1982; James et al., 1982) provided a preliminary model for the binding of inhibitors to aspartic proteinases which defined the specificity sites S4 to Sl on these enzymes. However, major progress has been made by the study of the complexes of renin inhibitors with other aspartic proteinases. Renin inhibitors have been developed mainly by modifying the minimum substrate sequence (residues 6 to 13) of angiotensinogen (Szelke et al., 1982). The scissilebond is substituted by various non-hydrolysable surrogates, some of which are transition state analogues (Blundell et al., 1987). Structures of inhibitor-bound complexes of aspartic proteinases (Cooper et al., 1987, 1989; Foundling et al., 1987; Sali et al., 1989; Suguna et al., 1987; Veerapandian et al., 1990) have been extensively studied as model systems of reninangiotensinogen binding. However, in spite of the overa. topological resemblance in the binding site geometries, differences occur in the subsites occupied by different inhibitors and none explain the specificity of renin at P,' and P,`. Therefore, although the general structure of renin can be arrived at by analogy with other aspartic proteinases,the nature of the exquisite specificity of renin in contrast with the "fit-all" specificities found for the fungal aspartic proteinases is not fully understood. Subtle distinctions in the subsites bordering the binding cleft might account for this wide spec-

trum of specificities. Hence, the precise three-dimensional structures of renins, preferably inhibitor-bound complexes, are essent,ialprerequisites fw the elucidation of the molecular mechanism of their enzymatic a&ivities and for the efficient design of effective drugs to combat hypertension. Large quantities of renin could be isolated and purified from mouse submaxillary glands and several crystal forms of native and inhibitor-bound mouse renin have been reported (Mornon et al., 1982; Navia et al., 1984; Sibanda, 1986). Recemly, milligram quantities of human renin have been obtained, in both the glycosylated and deglycosylated forms, using modern recombinant DNA techniques (Carilli et al., 1988; K. F. Geoghegan, A. Lanzetti, M. Ammirati, D. E. Danley, B. A. O'Connor & P. M. Hobart, unpublished results; Poorman et al., 1986; Vlahos et al., 1990). Tile structure of a partially deglycosylated form of native recombinant human renin has been reported (Sielecki et al., 1989) with a crystallographic agreement factor R of 9236 for 12,769 reflections in the resolution range 8 to 2.5 A (1 d=O.l nmj. However, the atomic co-ordinates are as yet unavailable, Preliminary analysis of the crystals of a glycosylated native form have also been reported (Lim et al., 1989). This paper presents t'he preliminary results of the X-ray crystallographic analysis of inhibitor-complexed crystals of glycosylated human recombinant renin and mouse submandibular renin currently in progress in our laboratory. 2. MateriaPs and
(a) Puri$cation

ethods
gland renln

oj mouse submaxillary

Glands (-200 mg each) were rapidly dissected from freshly killed adult male mice (strains AlP and AKR; Harlan Oriac Ltd) and stored at - 20°C until required. Renin was purified from 50 g bat,ches of glands using a modified procedure originally described by Misono et al. (1982). An aqueous extract of macerated glands was subjected to streptomycin sulphate treatment' and ammonium sulphate fractionation prior to chromatographir: separation using columns of DEAE-52 cellulose at pH 65 and Mono S at pH 51. Active fractions were identified by their ability to cleave a synthetic angiotensinogen tetradecapeptide substrate (SigmaChemCo.). The production of angiotensin I was monitored by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography using an Ultrasphere Cl8 column eluted isocratically with a phosphoric acid/sodium ehlorate/acetonitrile mobile phase (Klickstein 8: Wintraub; 1982). Purified products were concentrated by ultrafiltration and the protein content estimated spectrophotometrically. Product quality was examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 8.8 and by isoelectric focusing in a pH 3 to 10 gradient. The purified protein showed a single major band on gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The recovery of renin varied from 05 mg/g (strain Alp) to 1.5 mg/g (strain AKR) of glands, rather less than that reported for Swiss Webster strain mice.

L-929 cells were transformed with pHRC-5mt, an expression plasmid containing the complete human renin gene (Hobart et al., 1984) under the regulation of the mouse metallothionein enhancer sequence. These cells released prorenin into the culture medium. Prorenin expression levels of 1 to 10 mg/l were detected by Western blotting/immunodetection methods, and varied depending on culture medium and the time of sampling. Cultures (100 1) of transformed cells in low serum growth medium were used for large-scale purification of human renin. The conditioned medium was collected and concentrated to provide purification starting material with a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml. The major protein component of the crude sample was identified by CH-66

components (Higashimori et al., 1989); as neuraminidase treatment reduced this heterogeneity while raising the average pI value; variable patterns of sialylation appeared to be responsible for the existence of multiple forms of renin in the purified product.
(c) Synthesis of mouse

renin inhibitor

This inhibitor has been derived from the (6-14) fragment of rat angiotensinogen by (1) replacing the scissile Leu"-Leu" peptide bond with the hydroxyethylene isostere, (2) acylating the a-amino group of the N-terminal His residue with pivalyl (Piv) and (3) amidating the C-terminal serine carboxyl, to yield the following structure:

Piv-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Y [CH(OH)CH,)-Leu-Tyr-Tyr6 10 11

SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as bovine serum albumin (BSAt) derived from the culture medium. Purification of human renin was based on the observation that prorenin binds to immobilized Cibacron blue (CB) but mature renin does not (Carlson et al.: 1978; Yokosawa et al., 1979). Following an initial ammonium sulphate treatment, the sample was equilibrated with 902 iv-Tris, 0.2 M-NaCl (pH f+O), and loaded onto a column of immobilized CB (Blue Sepharose Fast Flow; Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After collection of a flow-through peak, the column was washed with equilibration buffer. Bound protein, including BSA and prorenin, was then eluted using 0.02 iv-Tris, 1.4 iv-NaCl, (pH 8.0). Activation of prorenin to renin depends on selective proteolytic removal of the 43-residue N-terminal propeptide that contains several sites capable of being recognized by enzymes of tryptic-like specificity. Immobilized trypsin (Trypsin-30 ENZYGEL; Boehringer) was used to convert prorenin in the BSA-rich peak fraction to renin. Progress of the conversion under a range of conditions was monitored by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and optimum conditions were selected for a preparative run. Following the reaction, the immobilized trypsin was removed by centrifugation and the crude activated renin preparation was again loaded onto the CB column. The conditions were similar to those for the first column step, except that the buffers were at pH 7.4. BSA and other contaminating proteins again bound to the column but renin was recovered in the flow-through. To concentrate the renin and eliminate residual impurities, the renin-containing fraction was equilibrated with 0.01 iv-sodium acetate, 0.005 M-NaCl, (pH SO), and subjected to cation-exchange chromatography on S Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia) using a NaCl gradient. Renin was eluted in a peak at approximately 0.1 M-NaCl. The purified renin was characterized by several methods. N-Terminal sequence analysis and SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a high level of purity. Specific enzymatic activity was in the range of 1 to 2 Goldblatt units/pg, in good agreement with other estimates (Poorman et al., 1986). Isoelectric focussing indicated that the renin was heterogeneous with respect to net charge, containing 5 major forms with p1 value in the range 46 to 5.2, as well as further minor t Abbreviations PEG, polyethylene used: BSA, bovine serum albumin; glycol.

Synthesis of the Leu lo-Leu" hydroxyethylene isostere was carried out as reported (Szelke et al., 1983) and was incorporated into the peptide sequence by standard solid phase methods (J. Sueiras-Diaz, D. M. Jones, M. Szelke, B. J. Leckie, S. R. Beatti, E. C. H. Wallace & J. J. Morton, unpublished results). CH-66 is a potent inhibitor having IC,,=O27 nM against rat renin (Sueiras-Diaz et
al.,

1989).
(d) Synthesis
of human renin inhibitor

The inhibitor CP-85,339 (Pro-Phe-SmeCys-norCStaOiPr hydrochloride) was synthesized (Hoover et al., 1989) in stepwise fashion from isopropyl (2R,3S)-3-amino4-cyclohexyl-2-hydroxybutanoate (norCStaOiPr) by sequential DEC-mediated coupling/HCl-dioxane deprotection of Boc-Phe-S-methylcysteine and Boc-Pro, respectively. CP-113,972 (Pro-p-I-Phe-SMeCys-norCStaOiPr hydrochloride) was synthesized in analogous fashion from Boe-SMe-Cys, Boc-p-I-Phe and Boc-Pro, respectively (D. J. Hoover & M. P. Carta, unpublished results). Both compounds were soluble in water at > 10 mg/ml. CP-85,339 and CP-113,972 inhibited human plasma renin (pH 7.4) with IC,, values of 40 n&r and 310 nM, respectively (RIA determination: W. R. Murphy, I. M. Purcell & K. Simpson, unpublished results). (e) Crystallization and X-ray renin inhibitor characterization
complexes

of mouse

Mouse renin was co-crystallised with CH-66 by dissolving a 5 : 1 molar (lo-fold) excess of inhibitor in renin solutions buffered with 0.01 M-sodium acetate (pH 56), using PEG 6000 as precipitant. The protein concentration was about 10 mg/ml and the PEG concentration in the wells varied between 10% to 35% (w/v). The crystals were monoclinic, P2,, with a= 78.3 A, b = 117.8 A, c=859 A, ~=lOl~lS" and had an estimated solvent content of 44 o/0 assuming 4 molecules/asymmetric unit. Intensity data from these crystals were collected on a FAST area detector to 3 d resolution with a completeness of 77% and R,,,, value equal to 7.5%. Subsequently, oscillation film data have also been collected on the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source to 2 L% resolution with a completeness of 861 y0 and an R mergevalue of 9.6%.

protein was concentrated to approximately 20 mg/ml and exchanged into 20 miw-Tris (pH 7.0) by ultrafiltration using Centricon 30 micro-concentrators. The inhibitor complex crystals were grown by the hanging drop method using 50 mw-sodium citrate solution, (pH 45), containing @6 M-NaCl and 10% (w/v) PEG 4000 as precipitant in the presence of a lo-fold molar excess of the inhibitor CP-85,339. The crystals were cubic, P2,3 (a = b = c = 143.1 A), and had 2 molecules/asymmetric unit with a corresponding solvent content of 598% (Matthews, 1977). Identical crystals were obtained from the desialylated protein. These crystals are isomorphous with the native enzyme.X-ray data on the crystals of the glycosylated protein-inhibitor complex were collected using a FAST electronic area detector. A total of 152,133 independent measurements were merged to obtain 18,859 unique reflections (Rmerge= 12.9%) at 3 A resolution, which constitute 81 o/0 of the total data. Co-crystals of the protein complexed with the iodoanalogue of the inhibitor described above CP-113,972, were grown under the same conditions. However, they are of a different morphology and belong to either the trigonal or hexagonal system with a= b= 162.3 a, c=141.2 11, cc=p=90' and y=120". Moreover, they diffract to an inferior resolution ( < 45 8) and hence are of limited use in structural studies. (g) Structural studies on the inhibitor complexes of human glycosylated recombinant and mouse submandibular renins Self-rotation functions (Rossman & Blow, 1962) were calculated using different subsets of the reflection data with varying resolution ranges. The IC= 180" section of the self-rotation function of the human renin complex shows 3 peaks in general positions related to each other by the crystallographic 3-fold axis, which runs along the body diagonal of the cubic unit cell. These peaks indicate the presence of a non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry that relates the 2 renin monomers in the asymmetric unit. This pseudo 2-fold axis is located at $ =59" and $J= 20" as shown in Fig. 1 (peak A,) computed using 3119 reflections in the resolution range 4 to 7 a with 4 and 20 A as the inner and outer Patterson radii, respectively. It is interesting to note that a similar feature was found in native crystals (Lim et al., 1989). The self-rotation function of the mouse renin complex computed using data up to 3 a resolution (Fig. 2) shows the presence of pseudo 2-fold axes parallel to a* and c, which suggests that the 4 molecules in the asymmetric unit of the monoclinic (PB,) unit cell are related to each other by a pseudo orthorhombic (222) symmetry. Further evidence for the pseudo 2-fold parallel to the unique axis is the presence of a strong Patterson peak near the (u,1/2,w) Harker section.

Inhibitor-complexed crystals of the glycosylated human recombinant and mouse submandibular renins have been prepared and analysed by X-ray diffraction in our laboratory. The structures of these molecular complexes will provide a wealth of information on the mode of renin-substrate binding and the mechanism of their catalytic action.
