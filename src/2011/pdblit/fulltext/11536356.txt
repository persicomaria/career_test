ABSTRACT The Thr29 residue in the hydrophobic core of goat -lactalbumin ( -LA) was substituted with Val (Thr29Val) and Ile (Thr29Ile) to investigate the contribution of Thr29 to the thermodynamic stability of the protein. We carried out protein stability measurements, X-ray crystallographic analyses, and free energy calculations based on molecular dynamics simulation. The equilibrium unfolding transitions induced by guanidine hydrochloride demonstrated that the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants were, respectively, 1.9 and 3.2 kcal/mol more stable than the wild-type protein (WT). The overall structures of the mutants were almost identical to that of WT, in spite of the disruption of the hydrogen bonding between the sidechain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain CAO group of Glu25. To analyze the stabilization mechanism of the mutants, we performed free energy calculations. The calculated free energy differences were in good agreement with the experimental values. The stabilization of the mutants was mainly caused by solvation loss in the denatured state. Furthermore, the OOH group of Thr29 favorably interacts with the CAO group of Glu25 to form hydrogen bonds and, simultaneously, unfavorably interacts electrostatically with the main-chain CAO group of Thr29. The difference in the free energy profile of the unfolding path between WT and the Thr29Ile mutant is discussed in light of our experimental and theoretical results.

Key words: protein stability; X-ray crystallography; free energy calculation; molecular dynamics simulation INTRODUCTION Elucidation of the conformational stability of proteins is important not only for designing stable proteins in various fields such as medicine, pharmacy, and industry but also for understanding the mechanism of protein folding. Over the past few decades, a considerable number of studies of protein stability have been made. Many of these studies have employed experimental approaches based on site©

directed mutagenesis combined with stability measurements and structure determination.1­5 To elucidate the mechanism of protein stability, both the native and denatured states should be considered, since protein stability is defined as the marginal free energy change between the native and denatured states, on the order of 10 kcal/mol.6 While measurement of the thermodynamic stability of a protein determines the free energy change between the native and denatured states for each protein, the structure of a protein in the denatured state has not yet been well characterized. These factors make it difficult to clarify the precise stabilization mechanism of a protein. In recent years, studies of protein stability have been successfully performed by using a free energy perturbation method.7­11 This theoretical approach is powerful for the elucidation of the mechanism for protein stability, since it provides the free energy changes due to the mutation in both the native and denatured states. Furthermore, the dominant factors causing the change in stability can be analyzed by searching for leading terms in the free energy changes. This analysis could offer critical insights into protein stability and the folding mechanism, in spite of some arguments regarding its validity.12­14

THR29 AND THE STABILITY OF GOAT -LACTALBUMIN

17

Understanding the stabilization mechanism of a globular protein is one of the major goals of the present protein science. The purpose of this study is to clarify the protein stabilization mechanism using an X-ray crystallographic analysis and free energy calculation based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We employed goat -lactalbumin ( -LA) as a target protein, and focused especially on the amino-acid variant of Thr29 on the B-helix. This protein is a small globular protein having a molecular weight of 14,200 and is expressed exclusively in the mammary gland. It tightly binds one calcium ion per molecule15 and acts as a regulatory subunit of lactose synthetase (EC 2.4.1.22).16,17 The reason to choose this protein is as follows; the crystal structure of -La is well known,18 ­21 and many studies have been made as a model for investigation of the protein folding mechanism.22­26 It is also known that the Thr29 residue of goat -La exists in the center of the hydrophobic core, in spite of the hydrophilic amino-acid residue. Our recent study has suggested that the substitution of Thr29 with Ile led to significant stabilization of the native protein.27 Therefore, in order to attain the purpose mentioned above, this system would be suitable. In this paper, we describe the stabilization mechanism of the Thr 29Ile mutant relative to WT in terms of a detailed energetic analysis. To investigate the stabilization mechanism of the Thr29Ile mutant precisely, we also constructed the Thr29Val mutant. We carried out an X-ray crystallographic analysis of WT and the two mutants and evaluated the free energy change by analyzing unfolding transition curves in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra (as an experimental approach). We also performed free energy perturbation calculations based on MD simulation (as a theoretical approach). On the basis of the results, we discuss the contribution of Thr29 to protein stabilization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Tokyo, Japan) or Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Shiga, Japan). DNA sequencing kits were obtained from Amersham-Pharmacia (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade for biochemical use. The concentrations of the WT and mutant recombinant goat -Las were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (E1cm1%) of 20.1.28 The concentration of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) was determined from the refractive index at 589 nm using an Atago 3T refractometer.29 Expression of Recombinant Goat -Las Expression, refolding, and purification of goat -La mutants were performed according to the protocol reported by Kumagai et al.30 and improved by Uchiyama et al.22 utilizing a T7 promoter.31 The genes of the mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of cDNA for goat -La.32 The mutations were confirmed by dideoxyDNA sequencing analysis.33 The proteins were expressed

in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) as inclusion bodies, solubilized in 8 M urea containing 20 mM TrisOHCl (pH 8.0), and purified on a DEAE­Sepharose FF column. The eluted protein was reduced by 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and dialyzed against 20 mM TrisOHCl (pH 8.0) at 4°C to remove urea. The refolding of reduced -La was performed in a solution containing 20% glycerol, 20 mM TrisOHCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM glutathione, 0.12 mM oxidized glutathione, 3.3 mM -La at room temperature for more than 24 h according to the method described by Sawano et al.34 with slight modifications. The refolding process was monitored by the appearance of a sharp peak on a reversed-phase HPLC (C-4 column; linear gradient elution, 28 to 52% acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, flow rate 1 ml/min); the peak was detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm. The refolded protein was purified on a DEAE­Sepharose FF column, followed by hydrophobic chromatography on a PhenylSepharose CL column as described by Lindahl and Vogel.35 CD Spectral Measurement The CD spectra of the mutants exposed to various concentrations of GdnHCl were measured in 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM NaCl at 25°C.36 A Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter and optical cuvettes of 1-mm path length (far-UV spectra) and 1-cm path length (near-UV spectra) were used for the measurement. The protein concentration was 0.08 ­ 0.4 mg/ml. Analysis of the Unfolding Transition Curves The GdnHCl-induced transition curves were analyzed as a two-state model mechanism, in which only the native and the fully unfolded states are populated in the transition region. The unfolding free energy change, GU, is related to the equilibrium constant of unfolding, KU, as KU exp GU/RT (1)

and GUH2O for each protein were calculated from equation 3 using the method of nonlinear least squares. X-Ray Crystallographic Study The WT and Thr29Ile crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method using a hanging drop at 20°C. For hanging drops, 5 l of the protein solution (30 ­ 40 mg/ml in 1 mM CaCl2) was mixed with 5 l of the precipitant solution (16 ­20% PEG8000, 0.05 M KH2PO4 buffer, pH 6.0, containing 1 mM CaCl2). Diamond-shaped Thr29Ile crystals appeared after a few days and reached a size of 0.4 0.2 0.05 mm. Unfortunately, under these conditions, the Thr29Val crystals were needles, which are not suitable for X-ray data collection. The Thr29Val crystals were obtained under a different set of crystallization conditions [25% PEG4000, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 0.05 M KH2PO4 buffer (pH 5.5) containing 1 mM CaCl2 at 4°C]. Diffraction data for these crystals were collected at 9.5°C using a DIP2000 automated area detector. Cu K X-rays ( 1.5418 Å) were produced by a Mac Science rotatinganode generator operating at 50 kV and 90 mA. The exposure time frame was 40 min and data frames (1.5° oscillation per frame) were collected for a total of 65 frames with no significant radiation damage. Data processing and reduction were performed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs.37 The data processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. The crystal structures of the mutants were determined by the molecular replacement method,38 using the structure of WT21 as a search model. Graphic evaluation of the models and electron density maps was carried out with TURBO-FRODO.39 Calculations of electron density maps and crystallographic refinement were performed with X-PLOR.40 Free Energy Calculations Based on Molecular Dynamics Simulations The simulations yielded values of the free energy changes for the mutation X3 Y in the native (N), G(N; X3 Y), and the denatured (D), G(D; X3 Y), states. Here X3 Y represents the mutation of residue X to residue Y, i.e., Val3 Thr and Ile3 Val. The unfolding free energy difference, DDG(N3 D; X3 Y), can be determined on the basis of the following equations: G N 3 D; X 3 Y G N 3 D; Y G N 3 D; X G D; X 3 Y G N; X 3 Y (5) where G(N3 D; X) and G(N3 D; Y) denote the unfolding free energy changes for each protein by unfolding from the native to the denatured state. It is difficult to calculate directly the unfolding free energies, G(N3 D; X) and G(N3 D; Y), because of the large changes in free energy and conformation. Therefore, we used equation 5 to calculate the unfolding free energy difference. As a reference, we calculated the self-energy change due to the mutation in a vacuum, G(self; X3 Y), using the short peptide (4)

structure Ace-Xaa-NMe (Ace, Xaa, and NMe, denote the acetyl group, the mutated residue, and the N-methylamide group, respectively). This self-energy change was subtracted from each calculated free energy change for the native and denatured states. The calculated values of G(self; Thr3 Val) and G(self; Val3 Ile) are 9.07 and 17.15 kcal/mol, respectively. The structures of the mutants, Thr29Val and Thr29Ile, containing one calcium ion and crystal water molecules were employed in the native-state simulations. The initial structure was prepared by immersing the protein into a water sphere with a radius of 34 Å and a density of 1.0 g/cm3. The number of water molecules was 4,762 for the Thr29Val mutant and 4,754 for the Thr29Ile mutant. In the denatured-state simulations, we assumed the following terminally blocked peptide, formed by cleavage of the protein at residue 31 (two residues downstream of the mutated residue) and attachment of NMe:

where Ace, NMe, and Xaa stand for the acetyl group, the N-methylamide group, and the mutated residue, respectively. The subscript numbers denote the original amino acid numbers of the protein. Since there is no unique choice for the denatured state, this assumption is reasonable. As the initial structure for the denatured-state simulations, the segment with the extended conformation was solvated in a sphere with a radius of 22 Å containing 1,455 and 1,454 water molecules for the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants, respectively. The AMBER all-atom force field parameters developed by Cornell et al.41 were used for the protein and the peptide models, and the SPC model42 was used for water molecules. AMBER4.143 was used to prepare the force field parameters of the protein. The MD simulations, which included long-range Coulomb interactions, were carried out for both systems by using COSMOS90, which is based on the particle­particle and particle­ cell (PPPC) approximation.44 The reliability and accuracy of the PPPC method have been demonstrated,44,45 and the accuracy of the parameters used in our work is the same as in the previous study.45 The PPPC method has been applied to the free energy calculation of ribonuclease HI46 and the DNAbinding domain of Myb.10 All MD simulations were performed at a temperature of 300 K with a time step of 0.5 fs. First, water molecules were equilibrated with the constrained positions of the heavy atoms and crystal water by 10-ps MD simulation. Next, the whole systems were equilibrated without any constraints for 590 ps for the native-state simulation and 190 ps for the denatured-state simulation. After the equilibration, free energy calculations for Val3 Thr and Ile3 Val in both the native and the denatured states were carried out in five stages by gradually changing the force field parameters of the side-chain atoms of the mutation site.

Each stage consisted of 10 ps for equilibration and 20 ps for data collection. To compare the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) of the native state during equilibration for the final 200 ps using available experimental data (i.e., the crystallographic Debye-Waller B factors for both mutants, Thr29Val and Thr29Ile), we calculated the RMSF of the ith atom, RMSF(i), as follows: RMSF i ri t ri

G1­5NB(28,29,30) was included in the inner term, since the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 interacts with the main-chain NOH and CAO groups of residues 28, 29, and 30. The inner term also contains a correction for the self-energy change calculated in a vacuum, G(self). On the other hand, the outer term is defined as follows:

RESULTS Analysis of the Unfolding Transition Curves WT and the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. Refolding and purification were performed as described in Materials and Methods. WT and the mutants were purified to homogeneity and refolded, judging from SDS­PAGE and reversephase HPLC, respectively (data not shown). The final yield of WT or the mutants was 1­2 mg/1-liter culture. To investigate the stability of the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants, we carried out GdnHCl-induced equilibrium denaturation experiments at pH 7.0 for WT and both mutants. CD ellipticities at 222 and 270 nm were measured, and the apparent fractional extent (Fapp) of unfolding was plotted as a function of GdnHCl concentration (Fig. 1).

where qobs is the observed ellipticity and qN and qU are the ellipticity values in the native and fully unfolded states, respectively. For each protein, the apparent fractional extent of unfolding measured at 222 and 270 nm in Figure 1 are almost coincident, indicating that the unfolding transitions of the proteins are well represented by a two-state mechanism in which only the native and fully unfolded states are populated. Data analysis of a two-state model was previously described in detail21,22 and is briefly described in Materials and Methods. The unfolding parameters [cM (the midpoint of the unfolding transition), m (a measure of the cooperation of the transition), and GUH2O (the unfolding free energy change at 0 M GdnHCl)] were calculated from the near-UV (270 nm) CD spectral data of Figure 1 by nonlinear least squares and are listed in Table I. Figure 1 also shows that the theoretical curves with the unfolding parameter values of Table I are fitted to the experimental data very well. Since the extrapolation to 0 M GdnHCl has a large error, the unfolding free energy

where the superscript asterisk and superscript zero indicate the mutants and WT, respectively.29,49 Analysis of Figure 1 reveals that both mutants, especially the Thr29Ile mutant, are more stable than WT. The Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants are, respectively, 1.9 and 3.2 kcal/mol more stable than WT (Table I). X-Ray Crystallographic Analysis To obtain structural insight into the stabilization mechanism of the mutants, we performed X-ray crystallographic studies. The crystal structures of the Thr29Val and the Thr29Ile mutants were determined at a resolution of 1.8 and 2.0 Å, respectively (Table II).Unfortunately, it was not possible to define the conformation of three C-terminal residues (121­123) of the Thr29Ile mutant due to the weak electron-density maps in these regions. The overall structure of the Thr29Ile mutant (Fig. 2) is quite similar to that of WT (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank Accession Number 1HMK; Chaudhuri et al.21). On the other hand, the Thr29Val mutant seems to exhibit significant differences in the conformation of the external solvent-exposed loops. For all main-chain atoms except those of the N-terminal methionine and the last three

residues (total of 120 residues), the root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) between the Thr29Ile mutant and WT are quite small (0.15 Å), whereas they are relatively large (0.84 Å ) between the Thr29Val mutant and WT. The structural differences between the main-chain atoms of the mutants and those of WT are shown in Figure 3, which represents the residual average differences of the mainchain atoms. The conformation of the main-chain atoms of the Thr29Val mutant is quite different from that of the Thr29Ile mutant and WT in the exposed loop region (residues 40 ­50, 105­110, and 112­115). These marked structural differences could be illustrated in terms of the difference in the crystal packing contact. The space group of the crystal of the Thr29Val mutant is not the same as that of the Thr29Ile mutant and WT due to their different crystal conditions (see Materials and Methods), and thus, the crystal packing contact is different. Therefore, we conclude that the overall structures of the mutants are essentially identical to that of WT and not significantly influenced by the mutations. This conclusion is supported by observations from the measurement of CD spectra of the proteins in solution as mentioned earlier. The mutated residue 29 is located in the middle of the B-helix (residues 23­34) in the -domain (residues 1­34 and 86 ­123). The structure of WT in the vicinity of residue 29 is shown in Figure 4(a). The side chain of residue 29 is surrounded by residues Glu25, Trp26, Ile101, Trp104, and

Leu105 and is completely buried (i.e., the value of the solvent-accessible area is zero). The side-chain OOH group of Thr29 creates a hydrogen bond network with the main-chain CAO group of Glu25. Simultaneously, the main-chain CAO group of Glu25 interacts with the mainchain NOH group of Thr29. Such a hydrogen bond network, a so-called (I, i 4) interaction, is statistically prevalent in serine and threonine residues in -helices.50,51 For the structure of the Thr29Val mutant [Fig. 4(b)], a slight change is observed in the 1 dihedral angle of the mutated residue. The 1 value of Thr29 in WT (N, C , C , and O ) is 60.7°, while the 1 value of Val29 in the Thr29Val mutant (N, C , C , and C 2) is 78.6°. This slight structural change may originate from the disruption of the hydrogen bond network formed by the side-chain OOH group of Thr29. For the Thr29Ile mutant [Fig. 4(c)], the 1 value of Ile29 (N, C , C , and C 1) is 81.8°, which is almost the same value as that of Val29. The other structural change is observed in the C methyl group of Ile101, which is pushed out to solvent by the substitution of Thr with a more bulky residue, Ile. These results indicate that the substituted residue could be introduced without significant steric strain. Thus, we concluded from the X-ray crystallographic study that the mutation did not exert a significant effect on the overall structure of the protein and that the structural changes were localized in the regions around the mutation site. Free Energy Calculations Based on Molecular Dynamics Simulations To clarify the stabilization mechanism of the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants, we performed free energy calculations based on MD simulations. The MD simulations were carried out for both mutants in solution without the truncation of Coulomb interactions (see Materials and Methods). The RMSD of the main-chain atoms from each initial X-ray crystal structure were plotted during the equilibration and the computational mutation (Fig. 5). In both cases, after the position constraints were released at

10 ps, the RMSD immediately increased and reached stable values of about 1.0 Å for the Thr29Val mutant and about 0.9 Å for the Thr29Ile mutant during the equilibration process. The stable value was also steady during the mutation process in each mutant, suggesting that the present MD simulations maintained the whole protein structure close to the initial X-ray structure without structural deformations during the equilibration and the mutation in the native state. To assess the validity of the simulations in the native state, we measured the average hydrogen-bonding distances between residues 25 and 29 during the equilibration for the final 200 ps and the mutation for the final 20 ps. We then compared these results with the corresponding distances from the X-ray crystal structures (Fig. 4). For WT, we measured the hydrogen-bonding distances between the main-chain atom N of Thr29 and the main-chain atom O of Glu25 (d1), between the side-chain atom O of Thr29 and the main-chain atom O of Glu25 (d2), and between the main-chain atom N of Thr29 and the sidechain atom O g of Thr29 (d3) (Table III). For the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants, residue 29 makes one hydrogen bonding between the main-chain atom N of residue 29 and the main-chain atom O of Glu25 (d1). To monitor the conformational change due to the mutation in each simulation, we also measured the distances corresponding to d2 and d3 of WT, using C 2 of Val29 and C 1 of Ile29 instead of O of Thr29 for each mutant. The result showed that each average distance in the MD simulation is almost identical to the distance in the X-ray crystal structure. This suggests that the conformational change due to the Val3 Thr and Ile3 Val mutations was reproduced in the MD simulations. Information regarding the fluctuations of protein atoms is obtained from the MD trajectory. The overall features of the root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSF) in the simulation are similar to those of the fluctuations in the crystal for both mutants (Fig. 6). The fluctuations in the crystal are systematically larger by about 0.2 Å than the RMSF in the simulation, except for

the crystal compared with that in bulk solution. These characteristics lead to the conclusion that the MD simulations realistically describe the fluctuations of the proteins in bulk solution. Thr3 Val The calculated free energy changes for Thr3 Val are listed in Table IV. The calculated unfolding free energy difference between WT and the Thr29Val mutant, G(N3 D; Thr3 Val), is 2.19 kcal/mol. This value is in agreement with the experimental value (1.86 kcal/mol) obtained from the GdnHCl-induced transition curves (Table I). The Thr3 Val mutation increased the free energy of the native state by 2.23 kcal/mol and that of the denatured state by 4.42 kcal/mol. Since the increase of the free energy change for the denatured state is greater than that for the native state, the Thr29Val mutant is more stable than WT. Val3 Ile The calculated free energy changes for Val3 Ile are listed in Table IV. The calculated unfolding free energy difference, G(N3 D; Val3 Ile) ( 1.11 kcal/mol), is in good agreement with the experimental value, 1.37 kcal/ mol. The free energy change in the native state was decreased by 1.23 kcal/mol due to the Val3 Ile mutation, whereas little decrease was observed in the denatured state ( 0.12 kcal/mol). These results indicate that the stabilization of the Thr29Ile mutant relative to the Thr29Val mutant originated primarily from the decrease of the free energy change in the native state. DISCUSSION A major goal of this study was to describe the stabilization mechanism of the Thr29Ile mutant relative to WT in terms of a detailed energetic analysis and to determine the contribution of the Thr29 residue to the thermodynamic stability of -La. We carried out X-ray crystallographic analyses and evaluated the free energy change by analyzing the GdnHCl-induced unfolding transition curves in the CD spectra of WT and the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants (the experimental approach). We also performed free energy perturbation calculations based on MD simulation (the theoretical approach). A short sequence fragment was chosen as the initial structure for the denatured-state simulation. It was difficult to assess this peptide model directly, since there is no experimental information. In many studies, however, free energy calculations using such a peptide model show good agreement with the experimental G value.8 ­11,46,53­55 Our experimental and theoretical results were strongly correlated, suggesting that more detailed analyses of the free energy changes would give further insight into the role of Thr29 in the thermodynamic stabilization and folding of -La. Thus, the free energy components were examined in detail. Component Analysis for Thr3 Val Mutation The free energy changes were decomposed into inner and outer terms (see Materials and Methods for details). These results are listed in Table IV. The inner component

residues 43, 44, and 45. The systematically large fluctuations in the crystal are considered to originate from crystal disorder.52 The fluctuations of residues 43, 44, and 45 in the simulations are significantly larger than in the crystal for both mutants. These residues make strong contact with other molecules in the crystal. This contact exerts differing deformations on the residue structures of WT and the mutants and suppresses the flexibility of these residues in

 For the Thr29Val and Thr29Ile mutants, the corresponding distances to d2 and d3 of WT were measured using the C 2 atom of Val29 and the C 1 atom of Ile29 instead of the O atom of Thr29, respectively.

in the denatured state, Ginner(D; Thr3 Val), was small (0.51 kcal/mol), suggesting that the inner energy change in the denatured state is almost the same as that in a vacuum. In contrast, the inner component in the native state, Ginner(N; Thr3 Val), was negative and relatively large ( 5.71 kcal/mol). This suggests that, in the native state, interaction between the atoms of the inner term in WT is disadvantageous compared to that in the Thr29Val mutant. To clarify the deleterious inner component of WT relative to Thr29Val in the native state, we examined the inner component, Ginner(N; Thr3 Val) in more detail (Table V).These results indicate that the large change of the inner term in the native state comes mainly from the unfavorable EL interaction between the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain CAO group of Thr29. The outer component in the native state was positive and relatively large (7.94 kcal/mol, Table IV). However, since this outer component is offset by the deleterious inner component, the free energy change due to the Thr3 Val mutation in the native state, G(N; Thr3 Val) ( 2.23 kcal/mol), is relatively small. On the other hand,

the free energy change in the denatured state, G(D; Thr3 Val) ( 4.42 kcal/mol) was mainly determined by the outer component (3.91 kcal/mol). For the outer component in the native state, the vdW component, GvdW(N; Thr3 Val), and the EL component, GEL(N; Thr3 Val), were 1.35 and 6.59 kcal/mol, respectively. These components were further divided into solventsolute and the solute-solute components. The major component of the outer term was the solute-solute EL interaction in the native state (8.50 kcal/mol). We found that the Thr3 Val mutation increased the vdW and EL components of the Glu25 residue in the native state by 2.04 and 4.96 kcal/mol [Fig. 7(a)], respectively, indicating disruption of the hydrogen bonding between the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain CAO group of Glu25. On the other hand, the outer component in the denatured state (3.91 kcal/mol) originated mainly from the solvent-solute interaction of the vdW and EL components, 1.60 and 1.32 kcal/mol, respectively. This result is reasonable since the polar OOH group is substituted with the hydrophobic methyl group in the solvated milieu. This energy corresponds to the hydrogen-bonding energy between the OOH group and water molecules. The free energy analysis for Thr3 Val clarifies that the stabilization of the Thr29Val mutant relative to WT arises from the increase of the free energy in the denatured state (4.42 kcal/mol) due to the solvation energy loss, which is larger than that in the native state (2.23 kcal/mol). Furthermore, the hydrogen bonding between the main-chain CAO group of Glu25 and the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 in WT contributes to the stabilization of a protein in the native state. Nevertheless, this favorable energy is offset by the unfavorable EL energy between the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain CAO group of Thr29. Consequently, the free energy change in the native state is relatively small (2.23 kcal/mol). On the basis of the detailed stabilization mechanism reported here, it might be proper to propose that Thr residues in the middle of -helices in the hydrophobic core do not make favorable contributions to the thermodynamic stability of a protein. It is of interest that the hydrogen bonding between the

side-chain OOH group of Thr and a main-chain CAO in the middle of an -helix is often observed between the residues i and i 4 in an -helix.50 Component Analysis for Val3 Ile Mutation The decomposed free energy changes are listed in Table IV. The decrease in the free energy change in the native state due to the Val3 Ile mutation ( 1.23 kcal/mol) originated from the vdW component, GvdW(N; Val3 Ile) ( 2.11 kcal/mol). The major contribution to the vdW component in the native state was from the solute-solute interaction ( 1.94 kcal/mol), indicating that the stabilization of the Thr29Ile mutant relative to the Thr29Val mutant was mainly due to the increase of the favorable vdW interaction in the native state. The vdW component from the solvent-solute interaction in the native state was negligibly small ( 0.17 kcal/mol), which is consistent with the result of the X-ray crystallographic study; i.e., the mutated residue 29 is located in the hydrophobic core and is not exposed to solvent for both mutants. For the EL component, all values were negligibly small. This result is reasonable, since the Val3 Ile mutation introduces only one neutral methyl group into the mutated residue. In regard to the vdW component of the solvent-solute interaction in the denatured state, the free energy was slightly decreased due to the Val3 Ile mutation ( 0.12 kcal/mol). Considering the difference in the transfer free energy change from the vapor phase to water, 0.16 kcal/ mol,56 our calculated value may be proper, although the solvation energy of the denatured state would be slightly changed by the context of the mutated residue.11

residue 29 in the native state. All these residues except Ile101 have negative values in GvdW(N; Val3 Ile), suggesting that they make positive contributions to the stabilization of the Thr29Ile mutant in the native state. In contrast, Ile101 has a major positive value in GvdW(N; Val3 Ile), 0.64 kcal/mol, suggesting that the favorable vdW interaction with Ile101 decreases due to the Val3 Ile mutation. Consequently, this increase of the vdW component of Ile101 is smaller than the decrease of the vdW component of the residues adjacent to the mutated residue 29, leading to stabilization of the Thr29Ile mutant compared with the Thr29Val mutant in the native state. Folding Mechanism of Goat -La WT and the Thr29Ile Mutant The results reported here combined with previous observations22,27 allow us to discuss the folding mechanism for WT and the Thr29Ile mutant. The unfolding free energy profile for WT and the Thr29Ile mutant is presented in Figure 8. The free energies calculated for the Thr3 Val and Val3 Ile mutations made it possible to estimate the free energy change due to the Thr3 Ile mutation. The free energy changes, G(N; Thr3 Ile) and G(D; Thr3 Ile), are 1.00 and 4.30 kcal/mol, respectively. We could then describe the unfolding free energy profile for WT and the Thr29Ile mutant as shown in Figure 8. The unfolding rates of WT and the Thr29Ile mutant at pH 7.0 and 25°C are 1.22 10 3 and 1.86 10 7 s 1, respectively.27 Thus,  G (Thr3 Ile) is estimated to be as large as 5.20 kcal/ mol. The result of the urea-induced equilibrium unfolding at pH 2.0 is used as the free energy change in the molten globule state.22 The free energy difference at pH 2.0 between WT and the Thr29Ile mutant is 0.12 kcal/mol.

 The contributions from 1­ 4 nonbond and 1­5 nonbond in residues 28, 29, and 30 to Ginner(N; Thr 3 Val) were very large relative to those from bond, angle, and torsion (data not shown). Therefore, the vdW and EL interaction energies between the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain NOH and CAO groups of the inner term were calculated from the structures obtained from the trajectories of WT in the native and denatured states using the atomic radius and charge in AMBER.41 The EL energy between the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain CAO group of Thr29 in the native state was much larger ( 2.99 kcal/mol) than that in the denatured state ( 7.46 kcal/mol). This suggests that unfavorable EL interaction between the OOH and CAO groups of Thr29 occurs in the conformation of the native state. On the other hand, since the charge of the methyl group is quite small, the EL interaction energies between the methyl group of Val29 and the main-chain NOH and CAO groups are also small. Thus, it is clear that the large change of the inner term in the native state comes mainly from the unfavorable EL interaction between the side-chain OOH group of Thr29 and the main-chain CAO group of Thr29.

This value was evaluated from the GdnHCl-induced transition curve by extrapolation to 0 M GdnHCl (Table I). (c) Activation free energy difference, G(Thr3 Ile). This value was estimated from stopped-flow CD measurements of the unfolding kinetics.27 The G(Thr3 Ile), was estimated by stopped-flow CD measurement of the unfolding kinetics, using the equation: G activation free energy difference, (constant) RTln(ku), where R and T are the gas constant and the absolute temperature, respectively. The ku value is the observed unfolding rate. Assuming that the constant is the same for both WT and the Thr29Ile mutant, the constant is canceled out and thus the activation free energy difference,  (Thr3 Ile), can be calculated. (d) Free energy change in the molten globule state. This value was estimated from the free energy difference between WT and the Thr29Ile mutant at pH 2.022 and the calculated free energy change in the denatured state, G(D; Thr3 Ile). (e) This value was derived from the urea-induced transition curve at pH 2.0 by extrapolation to 0 M GdnHCl.22

Thus, we assumed that the free energy change at pH 2.0 is almost same as that in the denatured state. These results strongly support observations made from other approaches using unfolding MD simulations.27 Specifically, the local structure around the side chain of Thr29 is not constructed in the transition state of the folding reaction but originates from a structural disruption such as the loss of interresidue contacts and water molecule penetration. The energetic solvation loss due to Thr3 Ile in the denatured state might remain up to the final folding stage of the protein. CONCLUSION Using both experimental and theoretical approaches, we have presented a detailed mechanism for the stabilization

of two goat -La mutants, Thr29Val and Thr29Ile. The stabilization of the Thr29Val mutant relative to WT arises from the increase of the free energy in the denatured state due to the solvation energy loss. The OOH group of Thr29 favorably interacts with the CAO group of Glu25 to form hydrogen bonds and, simultaneously, unfavorably interacts electrostatically with the main-chain CAO group of Thr29. Therefore, the contribution of the OOH group of Thr29 to protein stability is small. On the other hand, the stabilization of the Thr29Ile mutant relative to the Thr29Val mutant mainly arises from an increase in favorable vdW interactions in the native state by introducing the Cd methyl group into the interior of the protein. The unfavorable contribution of Thr29 to the thermodynamic stability of the protein might originate from the solvation energy loss during the folding process.
