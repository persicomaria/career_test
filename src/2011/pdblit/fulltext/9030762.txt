NMR solution structures of a cytosolic plant thioredoxin h (112 amino acids, 11.7 kDa) from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have been calculated on the basis of 1904 NMR distance restraints, which include 90 distances used to restrain 45 hydrogen bonds, and 44 4 dihedral restraints. The structure of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h was solved in its oxidised form, and the ensemble of 23 converged structures superpose to the geometric average structure with an atomic rmsd of 0.080 nm ? 0.016 for the (N, Ca, C) backbone atoms of residues 4 - 110. Comparisons with other thioredoxins, such as thioredoxin from the bacterium Escherichia coli, thioredoxin 2 from a cyanobacterium of the Anahaena genus, and human thioredoxin, showed that thioredoxin h models share more structural features with human thioredoxin than with other bacterial thioredoxins. Examination of the accessible surface around the redoxactive peptide sequence indicates that a potent thioredoxin-h - substrate interaction could be similar to the vertebrate thioredoxin- substrate interactions.

Thioredoxin and thioredoxin-like proteins elicit a particular interest in structural biology (Holmgren, 1995 ; Martin, 1995) because these ubiquitous small, globular proteins of about 12 kDa have been proven to have many biochemical roles, including regulatory functions, such as specific enzyme activation or regulation of gene expression (Buchanan et al., 1994; Levings and Siedow, 1995). These roles mainly rely on a catalytic redox mechanism through a thiol-disulfide exchange in a conserved pentapeptide (Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys) sequence (Eklund et al., 1991 ; Holmgren and Bjornstedt, 1995). In contrast to Escherichia coli or human tissues, where only one type of thioredoxin has been recognised, higher plants have been demonstrated to express several enzyme-specific thioredoxins (Jacquot et al., 1978). At least two thioredoxin species, m and j ; are located in chloroplasts, where they are involved in a specific thiol-redox-activity control of target enzymes of intermediate carbon metabolism (Buchanan, 1991). Photosynthetic cells also contain cytosolic thioredoxins h (h for heterotrophic cellular compartments or tissues). One of these thioredoxin h was recently found to be the major protein present in the phloem sap of rice (Ishiwatari et al., 1995). Genetic diversity of thioredoxin h was recently shown in Arahidopsis thaliana (Rivera-Madrid et al., 1 9 9 9 but the precise biochemical functions of thioredoxin h and their target structures remain unCorrespondence tu J.-M.

known. However, in cereals, the inactivation of an amylase/subtilisine inhibitor (Jiao et al., 1993) and the mobilisation of storage-seed proteins by a thioredoxin h was shown (Kobrehel et al., 1991). The phylogenicity deduced from the primary sequences shows that plant thioredoxins h are closer to vetebrate thioredoxins than to chloroplastic or bacterial thioredoxins (Rivera-Madrid et al., 1995). Since thioredoxins are thought to play a major role in the activation of nuclear transcription factors in mammals (Qin et al., 1995; Ghosh et al., 1995), the identification of thioredoxin h target structures is an important goal in plant molecular physiology. As an initial step, we recently reported an in-depth biochemical and genetic characterisation (Stein et al., 1995) and a complete ('H, I3C, "N)-NMR frequency assignment (Mittard et al., 1995) of oxidised thioredoxin h (11.7 kDa and 122 amino acids) from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Decottignies et al., 1990, 1991; Huppe et al., 1991). We describe here a plant-thioredoxin-11-structure determination by means of NMR, and discuss it in terms of structural comparisons with known thioredoxins (Katti et al., 1990; Jeng et al., 1994; Qin et al., 1994. 1995; Saarinen et al., 1995), and of potent protein-substrate interaction site. This work was presented in part previously (Mittard et al., 1996).

distribution of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h and human thioredoxin. To take into account the motional averaging of side-chain orientations, the electrostatic surface has been calculated for a series of the 12 first NMR structures of thioredoxin h and oxidised human thioredoxin, and the average grid value used to represent the effective encounter surface of the molecule. For human oxidised thioredoxin, we used the 1TRU entry (Qin et al., 1994) of the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977).

RESULTS

NOE assignments and structure determination. As shown previously (Mittard et al., 1995), C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h is of a molecular mass favourable for the analysis of its NMR spectra in two dimensions. Thus, two-dimensional NMR analysis is preferable due to higher sensitivity compared with furtheredited spectra in three or four dimensions. From the sequencespecific assignment alone, an initial set of 562 unambiguous approximate inter-proton distances was deduced. This core list of constraints defined the overall topology of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h, consisting of a pleated p sheet that contains five strands surrounded by four helices. Taking into account this topology,

mental energies) have been analysed in terms of hydrogen bonding. When a hydrogen bond was populated by more than 50% of the model ensemble, and if the hydrogen concerned was demonstrated to exchange slowly with D,O at a similar pH (Mittard et al., 1995), then the hydrogen bond was added to the set of restraints. From 50 structures generated, 23 presented no individual distance violation greater than 0.04 nm and no dihedral violation greater than 10". The statistics associated with this selected population of thioredoxin 12 models is given in Tables 24. A good correlation between the low values of the experimental terms (FKOF F~,i,,rd,.,, and in Table 3 ) and the low values of the physical terms defined according to the AMBER force field (Table 2 ) ensures that the 23 low-energy structures selected are also physically more favourable conformations. The selected 23 models of thioredoxin h are displayed in Fig. 2.

Description of the structure. The 23 models superpose with an rmsd of backbone (N, Ca, C) atoms of 0.08 nm? 0.016 excluding the first three and the last two residues, which are ill defined.

This value is slightly lower in regions of regular secondary structure (Table 4). The order level in the model family can be assessed either by the measure of the local atomic rmsd or the standard deviation of the 4 and w backbone angles (Figs 3 and 4). Overall, the alp open-twisted protein topology (Richardson, 1981) characteristic of the thioredoxin protein family is repro-

Helix a2 is also a regular a helix with mean (4, v ) backbone angles of (-58", -41") from residue Leu45 to Asp52. A small kink in the axis of this helix is caused by Pro44, and Ile42 deviates slightly from the a-helix conformation with (4, ty) values of (-71'27, -27"-+7). Except for Pro44, the helix displays regular helical hydrogen-bonding patterns from residue Ile42 to Tyr53 in more than 90% of the NMR structures. The third a helix, a?, is stabilised with typical CO,-NH,,, hydrogen bonds from Val67 to Gly75. The end of this helix is quite similar to the end of helix al, with (4, v ) values shared in two equivalent populations with 4 (+ 104" 2 8 or +66" ? 8) and a mean preferential angle ty of +41° ? 7 in 20 structures. Helix a, exhibits mean (4, ty) values of (-58", -48") from residue 99 to 109, and C0,-NH,,, hydrogen bonds are systematically found in more than 95% of the models.

Buried aromatic side chains. Seven aromatic residues, Trpl3,
Phe31, Phe46, Phe59, Phe82, His83 and Tyr85, contribute to the structural stability of the protein hydrophobic core. Two clusters of aromatic residues can be identified on both sides of the / l sheet. The first cluster consists of Trp13, Phe31, His83 and Tyr8S (Fig. 5). Phe31 and Trp13 rings are oriented perpendicular to those from His83 and Tyr85, which both located parallel to the b2strand, pointing towards the active site. On the other side of the p sheet, Phe46, Phe59, Phe82 and TyrS3 form the second cluster of hydrophobic amino acid side chains. The Phe46 and Phe82 rings are oriented perpendicular to that from Phe59, the latter is located parallel to the strand, pointing towards the Nterminus and C-terminus. In addition, 51-53, which has a conserved sequence position in thioredoxins (Eklund et al., 1991), seems to occupy a special location in this cluster, perpendicular and on the opposite side of the active site, at the end of a groove formed by the a, and a4 helices.

While the (4, v ) dihedral angles of Cys39 are well defined in all the models with average values of (-54" -+ 9, -37" 2 8, Cys36 is spread ) into several conformers with a major 4-backbone-angle values of -76'2 8 in 19 structures, and +72"? 15 for ty in 15 models out of the 23 selected. The disulfide bridge between Cys36 and Cys39 is in a conformation found in seven models, similar to the other oxidised thioredoxins (vide infru). Despite the local disorder, a similar type of ring orientation for 19 among 23 structures, was observed for Trp35. With the exception of structures 5, 10, 18 and 23, the and dihedralangle values for Trp35 were +52" ? 8 and +84" t 5 respectively, indicating that the aromatic ring is packed on the protein surface and interacts with neighbouring residues (Fig. 6). A hydrogen bond is found in this area between the side chain H1N of Trp35 and the side-chain O61/062 of Asp65 in 15 models, with a mean interatomic distance of 0.185 nm -t 0.004. This conformational feature is illustrated in Fig. 6.

The individual strands extend to residues parallel to from 4-8 (PI), 26-32 parallel to /I3), 57-64 p,), 81 -86 (p4antiparallel to p,) and 92-96 GR, antiparallel to p4). p, strand appears to be quite irregular, with an important The disorder centered around Asp8. In the P3 strand, Val64 forms a hydrogen bond between its amide proton and the carbonyl group of Thr32 (located in the p2 strand) in 20 structures of the 23 selected. This could include Val64 in the p3 strand, although the dihedral angles (4 = -53" -+ 5 and ty = -38" 2 8 for the structures, with the exception of structure 19) make Val64 part of a type-111 p turn (Richardson, 1981 ; Wilmot and Thornton, 1990) that comprises residues Asp63-Ala66. The p5 strand begins at Asp92, since the backbone dihedral angles of Lys90 and Ala91, though highly ordered, do not correspond to a p structure with (4, ty) values of (-57"?6, +98"?9) and (-84'26, -35" ? 5), respectively. The locations of the p strands confirms the location found by the secondary-chemical-shift analysis of T a (Mittard et al., 1995).

This unusual conformation was encountered in other thioredoxins.

The regular secondary structure is of thioredoxin h indicated at the top, with cylinders representing n helices and arrows representing l strands of the /sheet. Hydrophobic residues involved in the protein-protein interaction of human thioredoxin and a target peptide of nuclear factor KB (Qin et al., 1995) and the equivalent residues in thioredoxin h are indicated. 1.OO, fully accessible; 0, not accessible.

Table 5. Main-chain C a rmsd between known thioredoxins. Thioredoxin from E. coli (molecule A ; Protein Data Bank entry 2TRX; Katti et al., 19YO), thioredoxin from Anahaenu (entry 1THX; Saarinen et al., 1995) and human thioredoxin (entry ITRS; Qin et al., 1994) were used for the structural comparison. The number of protein sequence identities over the number of amino acid positions aligned are indicated in parentheses.

DISCUSSION Comparison with other known thioredoxins. Three-dimensional structures of E. coli thioredoxin (Katti et al., 1990; Jeng et al., 1994) a triple mutant of human thioredoxin (Qin et al., 1994) and thioredoxin 2 from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp.
PCC 7120 (Saarinen et al., 1995) have been solved by means of NMR (oxidised and reduced thioredoxins) or X-ray crystallography (oxidised thioredoxins). The superposition of the closest structure to the geometric average of the 23-structure ensemble of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h (structure 14) correlates with the phylogenicity of the four proteins (Table 5 and Fig. 7). A detailed comparison between NMR and X-ray structures of E. coli thioredoxin has been carried out by Jeng et al. (1994). The overall backbone structure of E. coli thioredoxin in solution is essentially indistinguishable from one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the X-ray crystal structure (Katti et al., 1990). The major structural differences between human thioredoxin and the two bacterial thioredoxins are reproduced in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h. In particular, the a , and a, helices are longer than in the bacterial thioredoxins. The hydrophobic packing is similar between human thioredoxin and C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h. The Trpl3 side chain located at the beginning of a, helix is buried in the hydrophobic core in the same manner as Phell of human thioredoxin. The larger surface of a tryptophan side chain could be balanced by a pronounced difference in the main chains of the two thioredoxins in the b,-strand and

lar, the Ile5 CO to Lys61 NH hydrogen bond is violated in 13 structures. Moreover, several amide protons from the a? helix, which appear to be involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonds in the models were not identified as slow-exchangeable protons in D,O. This feature may be related to specific dynamics of the a? helix, probably due to its shortness. During the NMR assignment (Mittard et al., 1995), we noticed the particular spin system of Ser50, for which a side-chain Oy hydrogen was observed, indicating a lower exchange rate with the bulk solvent relative to the other OH groups in the molecule. In the 23-structure ensemble of thioredoxin h, 20 structures show the OyH of Ser 50

Fig. 9. Electrostatic charge distribution of the water-accessiblesurface of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h (hCH1) human thioredoxin (Human).
The surfaces are the mean Delphi (Biosym Technologies/Molecular Simulation Inc.) grids from 12 NMR structures (see Materials and Methods). The values of electrostatic grids are shown at the surface of each molecule, calculated by means of the Connolly algorithm (Connolly, 1983) of the structure in the NMR family closest to the mean. The color scheme for the surfaces is a continuum from -3 kT for red, through white (0 kT) to blue +3 kT. The ribbon representation is shown below each molecule with the redox-active site (residues 35-39; 31-35 in human) region in green. Side chains for charged residues are shown in red for acidic amino acids and in blue for basic amino acids. Important residues are labelled. The fully conserved, buried aspartic acid (Asp30; Asp26 in human) is marked by *.

a,-helix regions. The main chains also deviate in the Gly5.5Lys56 region, where a deletion should be introduced for a best alignment of human and C. reinhardtii h thioredoxins.

Surface accessibility and surface electrostatics. Fig. 8 shows the compared surface accessibilities of oxidised human thioredoxin and C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h. Three regions appear of very low accessibility and correspond roughly to the three central strands, p2, p3 and p4,of the p sheet. Overall, the two profiles are very similar, especially for the residues that have been recognised as important in the protein-protein interaction of human thioredoxin with a target peptide of the transcription factor nuclear factor KB (Qin et al., 1995). These positions were divided into two categories. The first concerned exposed or buried amino acids of hydrophobic character: Trp31, Pro34 and Met37 (exposed); and Ile38, Va159, Ala66 and Val71 (buried). This group of amino acids are conserved in thioredoxin h with very little variation (Ile76 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h replaces Val71 in human thioredoxin). The second group of amino acids implicated in the protein-protein interaction in human thioredoxin was a group of hydrophilic or charged residues involved in electrostatic interactions. This group of residues is poorly conserved in thioredoxin h : Asp58 (Asp63 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h), Asp61 (Ala66 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h ) , Gln63 (Ala68 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h), Ser67 (Glu72 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h), Thr74 [Met79 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h, a substitution known to have no effect in human thioredoxin (Qin et al., 1995)], Ser9O (Val95 in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h), Ala92 (Ala97 in C. reinhardtii thiore-

doxin h). Therefore, we may conclude that target peptides of thioredoxin h should differ from the transcription-factor target peptide only in the electrostatic part of the interaction. However, when considering the molecular complex of human thioredoxin complexed with its target peptide from nuclear factor K B as determined by Qin et al. (1995), it would be possible to fit the target peptide into the equivalent position on thioredoxin h by losing only a few weakly stabilising interactions. The double salt-bridge between the Arg57 side chain of the target peptide and Asp58JAsp61 side chains of human thioredoxin would be replaced by a single salt bridge with Asp63 of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h, the two hydrogen bonds between Arg.59 side chain of the target peptide and the Gln63JSer67 side chains of human thioredoxin would be replaced by a salt bridge with the Glu72 side chain in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h, and the hydrogen bond between the Glu63 side chain of the target peptide and the Ser90 side chain of human thioredoxin would not exist due to the replacement of SeBO by Val in C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h. Fig. 9 shows the surface electrostatic potentials of C. reinhardtii thioredoxin h and human thioredoxin. Despite a difference in the model precision between thioredoxin h and the NMR models of human thioredoxin used here, the electrostatic potentials confirm the qualitative analysis above by showing an overall similitude in the region around the redox-active site. In particular, the cleft of human thioredoxin with which nuclear factor KB interacts is almost as electronegative in thioredoxin h as in human thioredoxin due to the conservation of several structurally similar acidic amino acids, such as Asp8, Asp63 and Asp65

in thioredoxin h. Thioredoxin h shows a large neutral surface (Fig. 9) located near the cleft. This neutral zone could explain the propensity of thioredoxin h to dimerise upon air oxidation in concentrated solution (Mittard et al., 1995). We have shown that this dimerisation was reversible by reduction and probably induced by an intermolecular disulfide bridge involving the only two cysteines of present in the active site of thioredoxin h. This large neutral surface could be a favourable feature for intermolecular contact between two thioredoxin h molecules. For the chloroplastic C. reinhardtii thioredoxin rn, this large neutral area does not exist, and no propensity to diinerise was reported (Lancelin et al., 1993; Mittard et al., 1995). During the preparation of the manuscript, the resolved X-ray structures of oxidised and reduced wild-type human thioredoxin and reduced [Ser73]thioredoxin and [Ser35]thioredoxin mutants were published (Weichsel et al., 1996), which were not available from the Protein Data Bank. This study showed that human thioredoxin in the crystal is a covalent dimer involving an intermolecular disulfur bridge through Cys73, a state suggested to be the normal state of the protein. The dimer interface is composed of 24 amino acids (12 of each monomer) and is mainly hydrophobic. In thioredoxin h, 8 amino acid positions are similar to these 12 amino acids and 4 of them are different, i.e., Gln63 in human thioredoxin is Ala in thioredoxin h, Ser67 is Glu, Lys62 is Thr and Cys73 is A h . We have shown by NMR-structure determination that a plant thioredoxin h involved in unknown biochemical processes resembles human thioredoxin, taken as a representative member of the vertebrate thioredoxin family, which is the closest, distinct family to that of plant thioredoxin h (Sahrawy et al., 1996). This similitude is not only found in the structural features of protein skeleton, but also in the surface electrostatic potentials. Hence, there is a possibility that plant thioredoxin h could function as human thioredoxin, especially in its capacity to regulate efficiently nuclear transcription factors involved in gene expression. Such nuclear factors have not been found in plants, but there is evidence for similar molecules in yeast (Morin et al., 1995; Moore et al., 1993). The results of the analysis of thioredoxinh-accessible-surface electrostatic potentials offer an explanation of its propensity to self-associate into dimers upon spontaneous oxidation in concentrated solutions, a phenomenon not observed for chloroplast C. reirzhavdtii thioredoxin rn (Mittard et al., 1995). Their diversity could reflect their adaptation to various target proteins by varying their surface electrostatic potentials. The molecular structure of thioredoxin h is a basis to study its thermal inactivation, which occurs at a lower temperature than the chloroplastic or E. coli thioredoxins (Stein et al., 1995).
