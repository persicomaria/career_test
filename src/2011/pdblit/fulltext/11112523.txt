ABSTRACT: Antigen-antibody complexes provide useful models for analyzing the thermodynamics of protein-protein association reactions. We have employed site-directed mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the role of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing the complex between the Fv fragment of the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody D1.3 and HEL. Crystal structures of six FvD1.3-HEL mutant complexes in which an interface tryptophan residue (VLW92) has been replaced by residues with smaller side chains (alanine, serine, valine, aspartate, histidine, and phenylalanine) were determined to resolutions between 1.75 and 2.00 Å. In the wild-type complex, VLW92 occupies a large hydrophobic pocket on the surface of HEL and constitutes an energetic "hot spot" for antigen binding. The losses in apolar buried surface area in the mutant complexes, relative to wild-type, range from 25 (VLF92) to 115 Å2 (VLA92), with no significant shifts in the positions of protein atoms at the mutation site for any of the complexes except VLA92, where there is a peptide flip. The affinities of the mutant Fv fragments for HEL are 10-100-fold lower than that of the original antibody. Formation of all six mutant complexes is marked by a decrease in binding enthalpy that exceeds the decrease in binding free energy, such that the loss in enthalpy is partly offset by a compensating gain in entropy. No correlation was observed between decreases in apolar, polar, or aggregate (sum of the apolar and polar) buried surface area in the VL92 mutant series and changes in the enthalpy of formation. Conversely, there exist linear correlations between losses of apolar buried surface and decreases in binding free energy (R 2 ) 0.937) as well as increases in the solvent portion of the entropy of binding (R 2 ) 0.909). The correlation between binding free energy and apolar buried surface area corresponds to 21 cal mol-1 Å-2 (1 cal ) 4.185 J) for the effective hydrophobicity at the VL92 mutation site. Furthermore, the slope of the line defined by the correlation between changes in binding free energy and solvent entropy approaches unity, demonstrating that the exclusion of solvent from the binding interface is the predominant energetic factor in the formation of this protein complex. Our estimate of the hydrophobic contribution to binding at site VL92 in the D1.3-HEL interface is consistent with values for the hydrophobic effect derived from classical hydrocarbon solubility models. We also show how residue VLW92 can contribute significantly less to stabilization when buried in a more polar pocket, illustrating the dependence of the hydrophobic effect on local environment at different sites in a protein-protein interface.

It is widely accepted that the hydrophobic effect provides the driving force for protein folding (1). Hydrophobic interactions are also believed to play an essential role in

stabilizing protein-protein complexes (2-6), whose interfaces are frequently, though not always, composed of a cluster of "hot spot" residues at the center of the interface surrounded by energetically less important residues that serve largely to exclude bulk solvent from the hot spots (5, 6). Because of its importance in protein folding and proteinprotein association, numerous attempts have been made to estimate the magnitude of the hydrophobic effect using a variety of approaches. Early model studies provided evidence for a linear relationship between the free energy of transfer of small hydrophobic solutes from aqueous to hydrophobic solvents and the burial of solvent-accessible hydrophobic surface area, with constants of proportionality ranging from 20 to 30 cal mol-1 Å-2 (7-11). With the advent of protein engineering techniques, it became possible to substitute a hydrophobic residue within the core of a protein by a smaller

In these experiments, the observed decreases in stability are generally greater than predicted from solvent transfer scales, up to 80 cal mol-1 Å-2 (12-19). However, a serious difficulty in interpreting the effects of large-to-small substitutions within protein cores is that such mutations generally create cavities, resulting in the loss of favorable van der Waals contacts between the bulky side chain removed and the atoms that form the walls of the cavity. For T4 lysozyme, a correlation was found between Gunfolding and cavity size for a series of leucine-to-alanine substitutions at different sites in the protein core (16, 19). The overall decrease in stability could be deconvoluted into two terms: one associated with cavity volume, which is presumably due to the loss of van der Waals interactions, and a constant term close in value to the transfer free energy of leucine relative to alanine, as determined by partitioning between water and organic solvents. For barnase, however, no correlation between Gunfolding and cavity volume was apparent for isoleucine-to-valine mutants (20), although an approximately linear relationship between these parameters was noted for isoleucine-to-alanine mutants (21). In a series of valine-toalanine mutants of human lysozyme, there was no correlation between Gunfolding and cavity volume, or between Gunfolding and changes in the hydrophobic surface area exposed upon denaturation (18). It is therefore apparent that extracting hydrophobic free energies from the effects on stability of large-to-small substitutions in protein cores is not a straightforward task, most likely due to secondary effects associated with the substitutions, including loss of van der Waals contacts at the mutation site and structural adjustments in the protein as nearby atoms shift toward the space vacated by the wild-type side chain. In the present study, we describe a different, and potentially simpler, approach to measuring the hydrophobic effect in proteins that relies on correlating changes in buried surface area in a protein-protein complex upon mutation of a large hydrophobic interface residue with changes in the binding free energy. As a model, we used the complex between the Fv1 fragment (a heterodimer consisting of only the light and heavy chain variable domains, VL and VH) of the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) D1.3 antibody and HEL. The crystal structure of the FvD1.3-HEL complex is known to high resolution (1.8 Å) (22), and alanine scanning mutagenesis has been carried out to map the binding energetics in the interface (23, 24). These studies have revealed that only 3 of 14 D1.3 contact residues (VLW92, VHD100, and VHY101) are responsible for the majority of binding energy associated with complex formation, with each mutation resulting in a Gb > 2.5 kcal/mol. More moderate but still significant effects were seen for substitutions at VLY32 and VHE98 (Gb ) 1.0-2.0 kcal/mol), while mutations at nine other contact residues contributed insignificantly to the binding energy (Gb < 1.0 kcal/mol). We chose the

Sundberg et al. VLW92 hot spot for measuring the hydrophobic contribution to binding because it is a large nonpolar residue that, unlike VHY101, is partly solvent-exposed in the D1.3-HEL interface. We reasoned that the lower packing density of a partly buried interface residue as compared to one that is completely buried should minimize the van der Waals component of the binding interaction, permitting the hydrophobic term to dominate. In addition, the loss of protein-protein van der Waals contacts at a solvent-accessible site should be compensated, at least in part, by rearrangements in solvent structure that restore shape complementarity between the interacting surfaces, as previously described (24-26). By determining the high-resolution crystal structures of six FvD1.3-HEL complexes with large-to-small substitutions at hot spot position VL92 and measuring their affinities by titration calorimetry, we show that there are linear relationships between the loss of apolar buried surface area and the decrease in binding free energy as well as the increase in the solvent portion of the binding entropy in the mutant complexes. Notably, there exist no correlations between the apolar, polar, or aggregate (sum of apolar and polar) buried surface areas and changes in the enthalpy of formation. We estimate the effective hydrophobicity at site VL92 of D1.3 to be 21 cal mol-1 Å-2 and find that this change in free energy is accounted for predominantly by relative gains in the solvent entropy upon complex formation. This value falls within the range of transfer free energies per unit of buried hydrophobic surface area determined for small apolar solutes (7-11). By comparing crystal structures and thermodynamic data of D1.3 binding to HEL and its anti-idiotypic antibody E5.2, we also show that residue D1.3 VLW92 contributes considerably less to binding if packed against a more polar surface than in the D1.3-HEL complex, emphasizing the importance of local environment in determining the magnitude of the hydrophobic effect at individual sites in a protein-protein interface. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Production of FV Fragments. The monoclonal anti-HEL antibody D1.3 derives from a Balb/c mouse hyperimmunized with HEL (27). The FvD1.3 and the mutants were prepared from the culture supernatants of recombinant Escherichia coli BMH 71-18 cells (28) transformed with the pUC19based expression vector pSW1-VHD1.3-VKD1.3 (29). For protein production, recombinant clones were resuspended in 10 mL of Terrific broth (30) containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 1% (w/v) glucose. The cultures were incubated at 37 °C under agitation to an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 mL of Terrific broth containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and 0.2% (w/v) glucose. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of 1.0, and isopropyl- -D-thiogalactoside (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM. After further incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the bacteria were pelleted, and FvD1.3 was affinity purified from the supernatant using the anti-D1.3 monoclonal antibody E5.2 (31) coupled to Sepharose columns. Columns were washed with 100 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.65 M final NaCl concentration, pH 7.4, and eluted with 50 mM diethylamine, pH 12. Fractions were immediately neutralized with 1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and concentrated using Centricon 3000 spin columns (Amicon,

Hydrophobic Effect in a Protein-Protein Complex Beverly, MA). Further purification of the FvD1.3 mutants was carried out by size exclusion chromatography on a ZORBAX GF-250 column (DuPont) in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (32). Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Mutagenesis of FvD13 was carried out with the Quick Change Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to replace the FvD1.3 W92 wild-type codon with that for alanine (GCT), aspartate (GAC), histidine (CAC), phenylalanine (TTC), serine (AGT), or valine (GTC). Prior to expression, all mutations were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide sequencing method using a Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (USB, Cleveland, OH). Measurement and Calculation of Thermodynamic Parameters. The interaction of soluble wild-type FvD1.3 with immobilized HEL was measured by surface plasmon resonance detection using a BIAcore 1000 biosensor (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (23). The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software package (Pharmacia). The binding constant (Kb) for the wild-type reaction was determined from Scatchard analysis after correction for nonspecific binding, by measuring the concentration of free reactants and complex at equilibrium. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the enthalpic component of D1.3-HEL association. Affinitypurified FvD1.3 mutants and HEL were dialyzed against PBS prior to calorimetry. In a typical experiment, 10 µL aliquots of a 1.00 mM HEL solution were titrated into a 0.05 mM Fv solution at 24.0 °C, and the evolved heats were measured with a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter as described (22, 25, 33, 34). The titrations were continued beyond saturation of the antibody combining sites to determine any heat contributions due to dilution of the HEL solution upon its addition to the antibody solution. The heats below the saturation point were corrected accordingly for any heat of dilution of the HEL solution. Protein concentrations were calculated using 1% extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 1.50, 1.34, and 2.62 for wild-type FvD1.3, FvD1.3 mutants, and HEL, respectively. The total heat was fitted via a least squares minimization method (33) to the total antigen concentration to determine the binding enthalpy, Hb, and estimate Kb. The binding entropy contribution, TSb, was calculated from Gb ) Hb - TSb, where Gb ) -RT ln(Kb). The binding entropy can be divided into terms defining the conformational and solvent portions, where Sb ) Sconformation + Ssolvent. The solvent portion of the entropy of binding is proportional to the heat capacity (Cp), which is a function of the apolar and polar changes in accessible surface areas (ASA) of the entire binding interface and was calculated using the following set of equations (35-37): and

A small molar excess of HEL (Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) was added to purified FvD1.3 mutants, and the complexes were crystallized in hanging drops by vapor diffusion. Crystallization conditions for the VL92D (25), VL92F, VL92A, VL92H, and VL92S complexes were similar to those used for the wild-type FvD1.3-HEL complex (32): 15-18% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.0-6.5. The VL92V complex, however, crystallized in 14% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 0.1 M sodium acetate, 0.05 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. Macroseeding in hanging drops was used to obtain crystals with dimensions up to 0.4 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm. A rotating copper anode source was used for X-ray diffraction, and data were collected on a Siemens HI-STAR area detector for the VL92A, VL92D, and VL92F complexes and on a 345mm MarResearch image plate detector for the VL92H, VL92S, and VL92V complexes. Crystals of the VL92A, VL92H, and VL92S complexes were soaked in 16% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, prior to flash-cooling in liquid N2; the VL92D, VL92F, and VL92V complexes were measured at room temperature. Diffraction data for the VL92A, VL92D, and VL92F complexes were reduced using XENGEN version 2.0 (38); data for the VL92H, VL92S, and VL92V complexes were reduced with DENZO/SCALEPACK (39). All complexes crystallized isomorphously with the wild-type complex in space group C2. However, data reduction for the second set of complexes resulted in distinct a axis and angle cell parameters relative to the first set. As seen in Table 1, the cell parameters of the second set of complexes, although different from the first set, are isomorphous to one another. This represents an alternative, yet analogous, way to describe the cell due to the parameter choices assigned by two different data reduction programs. The refinement of the VL92D complex has been described previously (25). Refinement of the VL92A and VL92F complexes was performed in a similar way using X-PLOR (40) and the wildtype complex (PDB accession code 1VFB) with all water molecules deleted as a model. Molecular replacement using the same unsolvated wild-type complex as a model was performed using AMoRe (41) for the second set of complexes in order to orient the model appropriately in the altered cell. Refinement then proceeded identically for all of the mutant complexes, except that CNS (42) was used for the second set of complexes instead of X-PLOR (40). The first refinement step consisted of rigid-body refinement, in which each of the three polypeptide chains (VL, VH, and HEL) were treated as independent rigid units. Next, an Fo(mutant) Fc(wild type) difference electron density map was calculated and inspected in order to confirm the mutation using the program O (43). Refinement then consisted of (i) modeling the mutation into the electron density, (ii) an additional stage of rigid-body refinement, (iii) one stage of simulated annealing refinement with a starting temperature of 3000 K, and (iv) iterative cycles of positional refinement, temperature factor refinement, and model building of protein residues and

(22) and VL92D mutant (25) complexes are reported elsewhere. Calculation of Accessible Surface Areas. Changes in apolar, polar, and aggregate accessible surface areas were calculated using the programs AREAIMOL and DIFFAREA from the CCP4 suite of programs (44) with a probe radius of 1.4 Å. These programs calculate changes in accessible surface area upon complex formation according to the algorithm defined by Lee and Richards (45). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structures of Wild-Type and Mutant FVD1.3-HEL Complexes. The high resolution (1.8 Å) crystal structure of the FvD1.3-HEL complex has been reported previously (22). The binding interface is characterized by an extensive buried surface involving 16 HEL residues, 17 D1.3 residues, and 25 well-ordered water molecules, which mediate 17 hydrogen bonds and a large number of van der Waals interactions through main-chain, side-chain, and solvent network interactions. Alanine scanning mutagenesis studies in which amino acid residues residing in the binding interface were mutated to alanine, and the free energy of binding to HEL was measured (23) to show that such an extensive network of noncovalent bonding interactions is not necessary for D1.3HEL complex formation. Instead, binding in the complex is largely dependent on a structurally smaller functional epitope

in the D1.3 molecule that includes only residues VLW92, VHD100, and VHY101. Further mutational analysis by double mutant cycles (24) has revealed significant coupling energies between HEL residue Q121 and D1.3 residues VLW92 and VLY32. The tryptophan residue at position VL92 fills a sizable and predominantly hydrophobic pocket on the surface of HEL, characterized by extensive van der Waals interactions with HEL residues Q121, I124, and R125 as well as interactions through two water molecules to main-chain atoms of G126 and C127 (Table 2; Figure 3A). In the free D1.3 structure, 93 Å2 of the surface area of residue VLW92 is accessible to solvent, while upon complex formation with HEL, the accessible surface area of this residue is reduced to 17 Å2 (22). The three-dimensional structure of the D1.3 mutant VLW92D complexed with HEL has been determined previously by X-ray crystallography to a resolution of 1.8 Å (25). The major structural change in this mutant complex as compared to the wild-type complex is a rearrangement of the water network at the D1.3-HEL interface where two water molecules occupy part of the space previously occupied by the tryptophan side chain (Figure 3C). All of the direct interactions between the VL92 residue side chain and HEL are lost when this residue is mutated from tryptophan to aspartate (Table 2). Only two van der Waals interactions to HEL residue R125, now mediated through a water molecule,

and the water-bridged interaction with the main chain of HEL G126 are retained in this mutant complex. Unlike the rearranged solvent network in the D1.3-HEL(D18A) complex that fully compensates energetically for the loss of one hydrogen bond and seven van der Waals interactions (24), the newly formed solvent network in the D1.3(VLW92D)HEL complex is associated with a reduction of the binding affinity by 100-fold (G ) 3.1 kcal/mol) due presumably to loss of extensive hydrophobic and van der Waals packing interactions upon substitution of the tryptophan side chain. To seek correlations between structural changes at the D1.3 VL92 hot spot and changes in thermodynamic binding parameters, we have determined the crystal structures of five additional D1.3-HEL complexes in which D1.3 residue VLW92 has been mutated to alanine, phenylalanine, histidine, serine, and valine. These mutations were chosen because they were expected to decrease the amount of buried surface area at this position by different amounts. The crystal structures of all of these complexes have been solved to a nominal resolution of at least 2.0 Å. As with other point mutants in the D1.3-HEL complex (24, 26), the CR atoms of the mutant complexes superimpose well onto the wild-type structure, with root-mean-square deviations ranging from 0.21 to 0.44 Å. As shown in Figure 1A, the largest main chain movement in the mutant complexes occurs in HEL on the side of the

molecule opposite the epitope for D1.3. Close-up views of the region surrounding the mutation site of individual mutant complexes superimposed onto the wild-type complex (Figure 1B-G) show that the only significant atomic movements in this region occur at the HEL C-terminal residue L129, for which there is commonly poor side-chain density, and the main chain of D1.3(VLW92A) in which a peptide flip occurs at the mutation site. Simulated annealing omit maps for D1.3 and HEL residues and water molecules in the region surrounding the mutation site for the mutant D1.3-HEL complexes reported in this study are shown in Figure 2. The major structural change in these complexes, as in the VLW92D-HEL complex, is the rearrangement of solvent at the D1.3-HEL interface, except in the case of VLW92V-HEL in which no evidence was found for ordered water molecules in the cavity created by the tryptophan side-chain replacement. Table 2 lists the direct contacts made by residue VL92 in the wild-type and mutant complexes with HEL residues and interface water molecules. It is evident that nearly all of the direct van der Waals interactions between D1.3 residue VLW92 and HEL are lost upon mutation of the tryptophan. Only in the alanine mutant complex, in which a peptide flip at the mutated residue allows a direct interaction between the VLA92 main-chain oxygen and the C atom of HEL residue R125, is this not the case.

The schematic diagrams in Figure 3 highlight that not only are the direct interactions of the wild-type complex predominantly lost in the mutant complexes but also that the rearranged solvent networks, which are quite extensive in some cases, do not necessarily mediate these interactions, nor are they generally replaced by newly formed watermediated interactions. In fact, only in the histidine and serine mutant complexes is a new water-mediated interaction between the side chain of the mutated residue and the O atom of HEL residue Q121 made (Figure 3; Table 2). Even when VLW92 is replaced by a relatively bulky phenylalanine residue that makes contact with four water molecules, none of the interactions made by the tryptophan, except the watermediated interaction with the main-chain nitrogen of HEL residue G126, remain. This nearly complete abolishment of the direct and indirect wild-type interactions between residue

VL92 and HEL in the mutant complexes is most likely the cause of the substantial loss of enthalpy of formation relative to wild-type observed for each of the mutant complexes, as discussed below. Thermodynamic Properties of Association in the Wild-Type and Mutant FVD1.3-HEL Complexes. Because the affinity was too high to be reliably estimated by titration calorimetry, the interaction of wild-type FvD1.3 with HEL was measured by surface plasmon resonance under equilibrium binding conditions (data not shown), as previously described (24, 26). The resulting association constant was used to determine the binding free energy. This value and the enthalpy of formation of the wild-type complex as measured by titration calorimetry were used to calculate the change in entropy upon association. In contrast, the affinities of all six mutant complexes were sufficiently low to be determined by titration

calorimetry, as shown in Figure 4 for the binding of the VLW92S mutant to HEL. The binding constant values obtained by both surface plasmon resonance and calorimetric techniques are consistent with one another as demonstrated by comparing these values for one of the mutants as measured using both techniques. The Kb value of the VLW92A mutant reported in this study as measured by titration calorimetry (3.3 ( 1.0 × 105 M-1) is in close agreement with the corresponding Kb value obtained using surface plasmon resonance (2.5 ( 0.8 × 105 M-1), as reported previously by our laboratory (24). The thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of wildtype D1.3 and the series of VL92 mutants with HEL are listed in Table 3. The wild-type complex exhibits the highest association constant, Kb ) 5.0 × 107 M-1. All of the mutations at residue VL92 analyzed in this study resulted in a decrease in the binding affinity between D1.3 and HEL of 10-100-fold. As with the wild-type complex, the mutant D1.3 molecules all form complexes with HEL in an enthalpically driven process with an opposing entropic

penalty that is significant yet smaller than in the wild-type complex. Each of the mutant complexes is marked by a reduction in the enthalpy of complex formation as compared to the wild-type, with Hb values ranging from 3.8 to 7.0 kcal/mol, as shown in Figure 5, such that the decreases in binding enthalpy exceed the decreases in binding free energy. These unfavorable enthalpy changes probably arise, at least in part, from the loss of van der Waals contacts and disruption of the hydrogen-bonded interface solvent network (Figure 3; Table 2). For each mutant relative to wild-type, the loss of enthalpy is offset by a gain in entropy of the system. The values of (TSb) vary from 0.7 to 4.4 kcal/ mol in the six mutant complexes. The variation in entropy values is even more striking when viewed as an energetic term that compensates for the loss of enthalpy upon binding of mutant D1.3 and HEL molecules, a phenomenon that has been noted previously in the D1.3-HEL system (26, 46). For example, by mutating VLW92 to a serine residue, there is an enthalpic loss of 7.0 kcal/mol relative to the wild-type complex. However, more than half of this unfavorable energy term, 4.0 kcal/mol, is compensated by a relative gain in entropy in the VLW92S-HEL complex. The entropic compensation for the enthalpic loss in each mutant complex varies greatly depending on the particular mutation at residue VL92. Surprisingly, for the mutant most similar to VLW92S, replacement of the wild-type tryptophan residue with aspartate, an essentially negligible (TSb) was observed (25), and the difference in binding free energy for this mutant relative to wild-type results almost exclusively from the enthalpic loss during complex formation. Entropic changes upon complex formation are defined by the summation of the conformational (Sconformation) and solvent (Ssolvent) entropy terms, derived from atomic move-

Hydrophobic Effect in a Protein-Protein Complex ments and the exclusion of bulk solvent, respectively. Thus, increases in solvent and protein motion in the mutant complexes relative to the wild-type complex could signify an increase in the entropy of the system. This should be indicated by the crystallographic temperature factors (B) of the mutated residue and the neighboring amino acids when the structures being compared crystallize isomorphously, which is the case for all of the D1.3-HEL complexes reported here. No significant changes in B factors, for the entire complex, the mutated residue, or residues and water molecules surrounding the mutation site, are seen when comparing the wild-type and mutant complexes (data not shown). In fact, the VLW92F-HEL complex, which has the highest measured value of (TSb) in the series, has the lowest mean temperature factors for amino acid residues and solvent molecules inclusive of and surrounding the mutation site. These observations run counter to the expected correlation between B values and entropy changes and contrast with results obtained for mutations at certain other sites in the D1.3-HEL interface. For example, increases in the mobility of side chains in the vicinity of mutations were observed for the VLY50S-HEL and VHY32A-HEL complexes, which probably contribute to the measured gains in entropy relative to the wild-type complex (26). On the other hand, in common with the VL92 series described here, no increases in temperature factors for atoms near the mutation site were noted for the VLY101F-HEL complex that could account for the large observed (TSb) value (4.9 kcal/mol) (26). Alternatively, residue VL92 (or its neighbors) may be significantly less mobile in the unliganded mutant FvD1.3 molecule than in the wild-type structure, such that the mobility of the unbound mutated residue is much closer to its mobility in the complex than in the case of the wild-type residue. Again, although this cannot be formally addressed in the absence of crystal structures of both free mutant and free wild-type antibodies, the available evidence does not support this explanation for entropy compensation. First, the mean B factor of residue VLW92 in the unbound wild-type Fv is indistinguishable from that in the complex, indicating a lack of significant quenching of side-chain mobility upon complex formation, which would be entropically unfavorable for binding (22). Second, as noted above, no differences in B factors for residue VL92 are evident when comparing mutant and wild-type complexes. Thus, significantly reduced quenching of side-chain mobility for VL92 in the mutant complexes as compared to wild-type is unlikely. It may be that the common use of temperature factor values to explain either global or local changes in entropy is not always valid. Certainly, in the case of the FvD1.3-HEL mutant complexes, no obvious thermodynamic extrapolations can be made using crystallographic B factors. Recently, several NMR studies have investigated changes in localized side chain/backbone movement of protein residues involved in protein-protein interactions and the redistribution of side chain entropy throughout the complex (47, 48). Similar site-specific measurements of entropy changes in the FvD1.3-HEL system by NMR may yield a better correlation with the thermodynamic data presented here than do the crystallographic temperature factors. Changes in binding entropy may also result from differences in solvent structure between FvD1.3 in its free and HEL-bound states. Accordingly, larger increases in entropy

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 50, 2000 15383 should occur for those FvD1.3 molecules that order more water in their unbound form and release these solvent molecules upon being buried in the binding interface, as measured by their respective Ssolvent values. The exclusion of solvent molecules from apolar surfaces is the main component of the hydrophobic effect that provides the driving force for protein folding (1) and is thought to be essential for protein-protein associations (2-6). Calculation of the Ssolvent values for the VL92 mutant series in the association between D1.3 and HEL bears out the importance of water exclusion in this molecular interaction. In the case of each D1.3 molecule, there exists a positive Ssolvent term that counteracts a negative and much larger Sconformation term (Table 3). Not surprisingly, the (TSsolvent) terms for the VL92 mutants are negative as the mutated side chains are each smaller than the wild-type tryptophan side chain and would be expected to exclude less water from the binding interface. Only in the case of the phenylalanine mutation at position VL92 is there a positive (TSsolvent) value. Additionally, these changes in TSsolvent are highly correlated with changes in the buried apolar accessible surface area upon mutation of VLW92, as discussed below. Estimation of the Hydrophobic Effect at Position VL92 in the D1.3-HEL Interface. On the basis of free energies of transfer of small hydrophobic solutes including nonpolar amino acids, from water to hydrophobic solvents, values of 20-30 cal mol-1 Å-2 have been proposed for the hydrophobic effect (7-11). By taking into account solute-solvent size differences, Sharp et al. (49) arrived at a higher estimate of the interfacial free energy derived from solubility data of about 50 cal mol-1 Å-2. For protein-protein complexes, Nicholls et al. (50) used a geometric model for the curvature dependence of the hydrophobic effect to identify two distinct contributions to binding: one from residues completely buried in the center of the interface and one from partially buried residues at the periphery. The effective hydrophobicity of central residues was estimated at about 60 cal mol-1 Å-2 and that of peripheral residues at about 40 cal mol-1 Å-2. In this study, we have sought to further extend these analyses in order to quantify the hydrophobic effect at the interfaces of associating proteins. Here, we attempt to correlate the measured changes in thermodynamic parameters with changes in buried accessible surface areas (ASA) in the binding interface between D1.3 molecules mutated at position VL92 and HEL relative to the wild-type interaction. We utilized the Lee and Richards algorithm (45) to calculate changes in ASA upon complex formation, using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. It is essential to choose the appropriate accessible surfaces over which to calculate ASA. Because of the crystallographic isomorphism of the wild-type and mutant complex structures, calculation of ASA values for the entire binding interface was necessary only for the determination of Cp and not for correlations with thermodynamic parameters. Due to systematic errors in the programs used to calculate ASA values, attempting to determine small changes in ASA caused by point mutations within the context of the entire interface reduces the accuracy of the measurements. Calculations of this type (data not shown) do closely parallel the results presented in the discussion below, although the correlations are not quite as strong. Due to local nonisomorphism in the VLW92A mutant caused by a peptide flip of the bond between residues VL92 and VL93,

it would be inappropriate to calculate ASA for only the residue at position VL92. Instead, we present data in the discussion below for which we have calculated ASA values for residues VL91-VL94. These amino acids constitute the loop of solvent-exposed residues (in the unbound D1.3 molecule) on which residue VL92 is located. One further concern when calculating ASA values for macromolecular interfaces is how one deals with interface water molecules. In our ASA calculations for the VL92 mutant series, inclusion of crystallographically located waters affect only the polar component of the ASA values (data not shown). As is seen below, correlations between the thermodynamic parameters of binding and ASA are primarily limited to the apolar component of the surface area, and thus, the discussion below is by and large limited to ASA calculations made for the VL91-VL94 loop packing against HEL without interface water molecules. Differences in the free energy of binding (Gb) and ASA upon complex formation (ASAaggregate) between the VL92 wild-type and mutant complexes are weakly correlated for the six VL92 mutant complexes in this study (Figure 6A). Linear regression analysis for these six data points results in an R 2 value of 0.782. When the changes in ASA are deconvoluted into their apolar and polar components (Figure 6B,C), it becomes clear that Gb is linearly dependent on the ASAapolar value (R 2 ) 0.937). The slope of this line is 0.0214, corresponding to an effective hydrophobicity at position VL92 of 21.4 cal mol-1 Å-2. Conversely, ASApolar and Gb reveal no correlation, showing why the correlation for Gb is weaker with ASAaggregate than

with ASAapolar. When ASA values are calculated incorporating fixed water molecules in the binding interface, the correlation between Gb and ASAaggregate becomes slightly stronger (R 2 ) 0.799). This is likely due to a more accurate polar surface area for which a weak linear correlation exists (R 2 ) 0.753) between Gb and ASApolar (data not shown). Inclusion of fixed water molecules in the ASA calculations do not affect the ASAapolar values, and thus, the correlation between ASAapolar and Gb is unaffected. In contrast to the strong correlation between the loss of buried apolar accessible surface area at position VL92 and the decrease in binding free energy, no correlations were observed between the aggregate, apolar, or polar changes in accessible surface area and changes in the binding enthalpy (Figure 7A-C). This suggests that measurements of Gb may be preferable to those of Hb for simple thermodynamic analysis of protein-protein interactions. A similar conclusion was reached in a calorimetric study of the interaction of barnase with barstar (51). In both cases, changes in Hb are large and erratic as compared to changes in Gb. Thus, results from two independent systems do not support the argument that enthalpy measurements are a theoretically more sound means of assigning energies to specific residueresidue interactions than free energy measurements (52). In protein folding, the driving force of the hydrophobic effect is the exclusion of water molecules in the tightly packed apolar protein core (1). It follows that the exclusion of solvent is likely the predominant factor in hydrophobic interactions between protein residues at the binding interface, which should be observed in changes in the solvent portion of the entropy term. For the six VL92 mutant complexes, there is a clear correlation between ASAapolar and (TSsolvent) (R 2 ) 0.909, Figure 8B). As is the case for

Hydrophobic Effect in a Protein-Protein Complex

Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 50, 2000 15385 of 21 cal mol-1 Å-2 for the contribution of the buried apolar unit area to the decrease in free energy is predominantly attributable to the hydrophobic effect, with only a relatively small contribution from van der Waals interactions. As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, residues VLA92, VLD92, VLS92, and VLV92 make a variable number of direct or watermediated contacts with HEL residues Q121, R125, or G126 with solvent networks linking the mutated residue to HEL present in the VLA92, VLD92, and VLS92 complexes but not in the VLV92 complex. Nevertheless, despite these differences in packing interactions, all four mutations, which are characterized by very similar decreases in buried apolar surface area (99-115 Å2), result in nearly identical losses in binding free energy (Gb ) 7.3-7.5 kcal/mol). In addition, as discussed in the next section, the energetic contribution of VLW92 to complex stabilization appears to depend much more on the chemical nature of the van der Waals contacts made by this residue than on their absolute number. Our figure of 21 cal mol-1 Å-2 for the effective hydrophobicity at the VL92 mutation site is comparable to estimates of the magnitude of the hydrophobic effect derived from classical hydrocarbon solubility models (7-11). Notably, this value is lower than estimates of the interfacial free energy for protein-protein interactions (49, 50). It may be that partially solvent-exposed residues in protein-protein interfaces, such as those at position VL92, are energetically more comparable to the transfer of small hydrophobic solutes from aqueous to apolar solvents because there is no extra energetic cost of cavity formation, as for those residues that comprise the hydrophobic cores of proteins (12-19). It is possible then that a similar structural and thermodynamic analysis of a hot spot residue in the D1.3-HEL interface that is completely buried in the interface, such as at position VH101, will have a larger effective hydrophobicity that is more comparable to protein core residues. Dependence of the Hydrophobic Effect on Local EnVironment. Although the significance of the hydrophobic effect in protein-protein associations is generally recognized, the quantitative importance of hydrophobic effects at individual sites in protein-protein interfaces has yet to be established. Dall'Acqua et al. (23) have compared the binding energetics of D1.3 to both HEL and the anti-D1.3 antibody E5.2 by alanine scanning mutagenesis. HEL and E5.2 share overlapping structural epitopes on the D1.3 surface (53) but differ greatly in their functional epitopes. Whereas only a small subset (3 of 13) of the D1.3 residues in the interface with HEL are energetically important for association, most (12 of 15) of the D1.3 residues in the interface with E5.2 make significant contributions to binding (Gmutant Gwild-type > 1.0 kcal/mol). No general correlation was observed between the energetic importance of individual D1.3 residues to binding and the buried surface area of these residues in the D1.3-HEL and D1.3-E5.2 complexes (24). Significantly, there are two tryptophan residues common to the binding interface of both complexes, D1.3 VLW92 and VHW52. These have approximately equal buried surface areas in the D1.3-HEL and D1.3-E5.2 structures (22, 53). However, VLW92 acts as a hot spot in the D1.3-HEL complex (GD1.3(VLW92A)-HEL ) 3.3 kcal/mol) but has little effect on the binding of D1.3 to E5.2 (GD1.3(VLW92A)-E5.2 ) 0.9 kcal/mol) (24). Conversely, VHW52 contributes

(D) Correlation between Gb and (TSsolvent) for the VL92 mutant series, including the best-fit line from least-squares regression analysis.

Gb, ASApolar does not correlate to (TSsolvent) (Figure 8C) and, thus, (TSsolvent) is more poorly correlated to ASAaggregate (R 2 ) 0.844, Figure 8A) than to ASAapolar. Because Gb and (TSsolvent) are both linearly correlated to ASAapolar, they also must be linearly correlated to one another (R 2 ) 0.875, Figure 8D). Importantly, the slope of the line defined by the Gb and (TSsolvent) values of the six VL92 mutant complexes is -1.46. In order for all binding free energy differences to be caused by changes in TSsolvent between the wild-type and mutant complexes, the slope of this line would need to be one. Instead, factors other than changes in the solvent entropy, for which we cannot account in this study, contribute to changes in the binding free energy. The solvent portion of the entropy term, however, is the predominant factor affecting changes in Gb for the VL92 mutant complexes. The decrease in binding free energy and the increase in solvent entropy associated with the loss of buried apolar surface area (Figures 6B and 8B) must be the consequence of reduced hydrophobic interactions at the complex interface and/or loss of van der Waals contacts, since neither wildtype nor mutated residues at position VL92 form direct hydrogen bonds to HEL. We believe that our measured value

15386 Biochemistry, Vol. 39, No. 50, 2000 insignificantly to the association of D1.3 to HEL (GD1.3(VHW52A)-HEL ) 0.4 kcal/mol) but plays an important energetic role in the D1.3-E5.2 complex (GD1.3(VHW52A)-E5.2 ) 4.2 kcal/mol) (23). As the structures of D1.3 residues VLW92 and VHW52 in the unbound state are equivalent whether they are to bind HEL or E5.2 by definition, the reason that they are functionally dissimilar in the D1.3HEL and D1.3-E5.2 complexes is most likely due to the local environments of the ligands against which the tryptophan residues are packed. Indeed, an analysis of the atomic interactions made by D1.3 residues VLW92 and VHW52 with HEL and E5.2 reveals that the two hot spots (VLW92-HEL and VHW52-E5.2) are dominated by carbon-carbon interactions (7 C-C, 1 C-N and 13 C-C, 2 C-O, 1 C-N, respectively), whereas the two energetically unimportant interactions (VLW92-E5.2 and VHW52-HEL) are composed of more of a mixture noncovalent interactions (3 C-C, 2 C-O, 3 C-N, 1 O-N and 6 C-C, 3 C-O, 2 C-N, respectively). Differences in the buried apolar ASA of these two residues when bound to each ligand help to elucidate the role that the local binding environment plays in the thermodynamics of these protein-protein associations. In the D1.3-HEL complex, residue VLW92 buries an apolar ASA of -147 Å2, while residue VHW52 buries -122 Å2. The difference in buried apolar ASA of 25 Å2 corresponds to a free energy change of 1.4 kcal/mol, according to the correlation between Gb and ASAapolar defined above (Figure 6A). This value, which we have termed Genvironment, represents the estimated change in binding free energy that can be attributed to the hydrophobic differences in the binding surfaces encountered by the two tryptophan residues. Furthermore, one can estimate that the change in Gb for a mutation of residue VHW52 to alanine, if it were to pack against an environment that is structurally and chemically similar to the HEL binding interface for residue VLW92, to be 2.3 kcal/mol; that is, the sum of GD1.3(VLW52A)-HEL and Genvironment. Although this is not equivalent to the GD1.3(VLW92A)-HEL value of 3.3 kcal/mol, it is within the energetic range that defines a residue as a hot spot in binding. Analogously, the difference in buried apolar ASA for tryptophan residues at positions VL92 and VH52 in the D1.3E5.2 complex is 98 Å2, corresponding to a Genvironment of 3.0 kcal/mol. The free energy change for a VLW92A mutation interacting with an environment similar to the E5.2 binding site for VHW52 is estimated to be 3.4 kcal/mol. Again, although this value is not equivalent to that of GD1.3(VHW52A)-E5.2, it could clearly be defined as a hot spot in binding. This analysis provides insight into the molecular interaction requirements of tryptophan residues to act as hot spots in protein-protein associations. It is likely that these packing requirements hold true in other protein complexes. In the complex of human growth hormone with its receptor, a central contiguous core of hydrophobic residues confers the majority of binding energy to the complex (54-56). As in the D1.3 complexes with HEL and E5.2, no overall correlation was observed between the relative contribution of individual residues to the binding energetics and the buried surface area of these residues in the hormone-receptor complex. However, mutation of two tryptophans (W104 and W169) on the receptor side of the interface results in the greatest losses of binding free energy.

Sundberg et al. Significantly, these hot spot tryptophans pack tightly against a hydrophobic surface on the hormone molecule composed of nonpolar residues and the alkyl portions of charged residues (57), much like the D1.3 hot spot tryptophans VLW92 and VHW52 do in complex with HEL and E5.2, respectively. The above discussion underscores the importance of local environment in determining the contribution of individual residues to stabilizing protein-protein complexes. That is, not only must one consider the hydrophobicity of the residue itself but also that of the surface against which it packs. Unlike the organic solvents used in model experiments to measure free energies of transfer of nonpolar amino acids from water to hydrophobic environments (7-11), protein surfaces exhibit considerable chemical heterogeneity, such that buried surface area and location in the interface (i.e., central or peripheral) are by themselves insufficient indicators of a particular residue's importance in binding; consideration must also be given to its microenvironment in the complex. For this reason, our value of 21 cal mol-1 Å-2 for the effective hydrophobic energy at the VL92 mutation site in the D1.3-HEL complex, although probably applicable to other sites in which hyrdophobic residues pack against predominantly hydrophobic surfaces, may be considerably less at sites where such residues are buried in more polar environments (e.g., D1.3 VLW92 in the D1.3-E5.2 complex). CONCLUSIONS We have shown that for a single tryptophan hot spot, VLW92 in the FvD1.3-HEL complex, changes in free energy of binding are directly correlated to changes in buried apolar surface area upon mutation to residues with smaller side chains. The effective hydrophobicity at this site is calculated to be 21 cal mol-1 Å-2 and is in good agreement with transfer free energy values for small hydrophobic solutes (7-11). Furthermore, the slope of the linear dependence of Gb on changes in the solvent component of the entropy term, (TSsolvent), approaches unity, meaning that the freeing of bulk solvent from this site in the interface upon association is the predominant factor affecting the affinity of this complex. Analysis of a limited number of tryptophan residues that reside in the binding interface of protein-protein complexes and act either as hot spots in binding or are thermodynamically unimportant in complex formation leads us to propose that tryptophan residues in protein-protein interfaces may be categorized as belonging to the functional epitope or not according to the polarity of the environment against which they pack. This may help in predicting the energetic importance of interface residues without such exhaustive mutational studies as presented here for position VL92 in the D1.3-HEL complex.
