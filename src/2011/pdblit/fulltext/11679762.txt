Atomic resolution structure of endoglucanase Cel5A in complex with methyl 4,4II,4III,4IVtetrathio-a-cellopentoside highlights the alternative binding modes targeted by substrate mimics
Many three-dimensional structures of retaining -d-glycoside hydrolases have been determined, yet oligosaccharide complexes in which the ligand spans the catalytic centre are rare. Those that have been reported so far have revealed two modes of binding: those in which the substrate adopts a distorted skew-boat or envelope conformation in the À1 subsite, re¯ecting the distortion observed during the catalytic cycle, and those which bypass the true catalytic centre and thus lie in a non-productive manner across the À1 subsite. The three-dimensional structure of a retaining endocellulase, Bacillus agaradhaerens Cel5A, in complex with methyl 4,4II,4III,4IV-tetrathioÊ -cellopentoside falls into this latter category. The 1.1 A structure reveals the binding of ®ve pyranosides, all in the 4C1 chair conformation, occupying the À3, À2, +1 and +2 subsites whilst evading the catalytic machinery located in the true À1 subsite. Such binding is in marked contrast to the structure of another retaining endocellulase, the Fusarium oxysporum Cel7B, the identical ligand in which displayed a distorted skew-boat conformation at the active centre. These two binding modes may re¯ect different steps in the binding and catalytic process.

1. Introduction
Retaining -glycoside hydrolases perform catalysis via a double-displacement mechanism in which a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate is ¯anked by oxocarbenium-ion-like transition states (most recently reviewed in Rye & Withers, 2000; Zechel & Withers, 2000). Oligosaccharide complexes of these enzymes have rarely revealed binding modes in which the ligand spans the point of cleavage. Indeed, whilst there are many hundreds of deposited PDB ®les for retaining -d-glycoside hydrolases available at the present date, only a handful contain a ligand that unambiguously traverses the catalytic centre. These complexes reveal two distinct modes of binding. In one the pyranoside in the À1 subsite is distorted towards the 1S3 (skew-boat) or 4E (envelope) conformation, re¯ecting the geometric constraints upon the incipient oxocarbenium ion of the natural catalytic cycle. Structures of this type have been observed for an F. oxysporum Cel7B±thiooligosaccharide complex (Sulzenbacher et al., 1996, 1997), the complex of B. agaradhaerens Cel5A with 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-¯uoro--d-cellobioside (Davies, Dauter et al., 1998) and the Serratia marcesens chitobiase bound to its natural ligand chitobiose (Tews et al., 1996) (Fig. 1). Alternatively, the oligosaccharide ligand may display no distortion and simply span the active

centre, evading the point of cleavage by leaving the anomeric carbon distant from the enzymatic nucleophile. Such complexes have been observed with Pseudomonas cellulosa Xyn10A (Harris et al., 1994) and Trichoderma reesei Cel7A (Divne et al., 1998). Thiooligosaccharides possess many characteristics that should enable the study of active-centre-spanning complexes and have therefore found great use as probes for the study of carbohydrate±enzyme interactions (see, for example, Schmidt et al., 1998; Sulzenbacher et al., 1996; Watson et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999; for a review, see Driguez, 1995, 2001). They are hydrolytically inert, whilst their conformation is almost identical to the natural substrate. Changes only occur at the glycosidic bond, where the angle is 97 and Ê the bond length is 1.83 A compared with Ê approximately 117 and 1.41 A in the natural O-glycosidic bond. This results in a difference Ê of approximately 0.35 A in the positions of adjacent sugars (Driguez, 2001). Indeed, structures of the maltodextrin phosphorylase from Escherichia coli in complex with its natural substrate maltopentaose and a 4-S-Glcp-thiomaltotetraose reveal no appreciable difference in binding of the natural substrate and its thio analogue within the error level of the experiment (Watson et al., 1999). Here, we present the structure of Cel5A from B. agarÊ adhaerens at 1.1 A resolution in complex with a

A comparison of this structure with related complexes highlights the different conformations that even identical substrate mimics may adopt upon binding. single crystal at 100 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble), beamline ID14-2 (! = 0.933), using an ADSC QUANTUM 4 chargecoupled device (CCD) detector. Data were processed and reduced using the DENZO/ SCALEPACK programs (Otwinowski, 1993; Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). All further computing used the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) unless otherwise stated. The native Cel5A coordinates were used as the starting model (PDB code 1qhz; Varrot et al., 2000). Identical cross-validation re¯ections utilized for the native structure determination were maintained and Ê extended to the full resolution limit of 1.1 A for re®nement with REFMAC, thereby maintaining 5% of free re¯ections in all resolution shells (Murshudov et al., 1997). At no point was a ' cutoff on intensities applied during the re®nement. A spherically restrained anisotropic model for the atomic displacement parameters was guided by the behaviour of the cross-validation re¯ections. H atoms were added in their `riding' positions and used for geometry and structure-factor calculations (see REFMAC documentation for details at http:// www.ccp4.ac.uk/). tetragonal crystal form. This necessitated ten cycles of rigid-body re®nement prior to restrained maximum-likelihood re®nement using the native tetragonal coordinates as starting model. The ®nal model structure has an Rcryst value of 0.120 and Rfree = 0.138 for Ê data between 20.0 and 1.1 A. This model displays deviations from stereochemical Ê target values of 0.017 A for bonds and 1.8 for angles, and has been deposited with PDB code 1h5v (Fig. 2). Inspection of the initial electron-density map for Cel5A revealed clear density for all ®ve glucose moieties of the inhibitor spanning all the active site, subsites À3 to +2 (Fig. 3a). All glucose moieties are in the 4C1 chair conformation and the À1 subsite sugar is `displaced' from a catalytically relevant position in the À1 subsite. Conformational change accompanies binding. In previous complex structures, a loop forming one wall of the À1 subsite underwent movement re¯ecting the occupancy of that subsite. Here, where the true À1 subsite is not occupied but the sugar binds in an alternative position close to the À1 site, the loop presents an intermediate conformation between these `open' and `closed' conformations observed previously (Davies, Dauter et al., 1998; Varrot et al., 2000). The `displaced' À1 subsite is distinguished by its paucity of direct interactions with the protein. Only the O2 hydroxyl interacts with protein directly, via both carbonyl O atoms of the acid/base Glu139 (distances of 3.1 and Ê 2.6 A, respectively). The O6 hydroxyl interacts only with solvent-exposed water. O3 interacts only with a water molecule which is in turn is hydrogen bonded to both His101 and Tyr66. This alternative À1 binding site is very similar to that occupied by the mixed / `bypass' ligands described previously (Fort et al., 2001) (Fig. 3b). The anomeric

2. Experimental
The catalytic core domain of Cel5A from B. agaradhaerens was puri®ed as described previously (Davies, Mackenzie et al., 1998). Crystals grew in the space group P43212 from a solution containing 28±30%(v/v) PEG 400 as precipitant, 100 mM triethanolamine (TEA) or HEPES pH 7.0 as buffer and 200 mM calcium chloride. The methyl 4,4II,4III,4IV-tetrathio--cellopentoside complex was obtained by cocrystallization after incubation of the enzyme with 1 mM of the compound (whose synthesis has been described previously; Schou et al., 1993) for 1 h. Crystals were mounted in rayon-®bre loops directly from the droplets. The presence of 30% PEG 400 in the crystallization conditions meant that no additional cryoprotective agents were necessary. X-ray diffraction data were collected from a

hydroxyl of the adjacent sugar in a manner we have not described previously (Fig. 4). In the previously reported structure of Cel7B, the identical thiopentasaccharide bound in a substantially different manner. In Ê Ê that 2.8 A study (later con®rmed at 1.9 A; Sulzenbacher, 1999) the sugar in À1 was distorted towards a 1S3 skew-boat conformation. SDP5 is a competitive inhibitor for both Cel5A and Cel7B with Ki values of 117 and 30 mM, respectively (Schou et al., 1993). These enzymes are both retaining endoglucanases acting on the same oligosaccharide substrates with 4±5 kinetically signi®cant subsites (Davies, Dauter et al., 1998; Schou et al., 1993), yet the binding modes adopted by the thiopentasaccharides through the À1 subsite are substantially different. Why these enzymes bind the ligand differently is unclear. The binding mode that `bypasses' the catalytic machinery, exempli®ed by the Cel5A complex, is necessarily non-productive. It cannot be ruled out, however, that this mode represents an early step in the natural catalytic cycle: an initial binding event with the À1 subsite sugar in the 4C1 chair conformation collapsing to form the productive complex for in-line nucleophilic attack (proposed in Divne et al., 1998). Furthermore, observation of such complexes highlights the potential for overinterpretation of single complex structures since this nonproductive binding mode, in the absence of other data, would suggest incorrect roles for many of the residues including the catalytic acid/base and the nucleophile. We have recently utilized the observation that these enzymes can tolerate or even favour an undistorted `misplaced' sugar in the À1 subsite to harness mixed /-linked `bypass' inhibitors which appear to target this alternate binding mode (Fort et al., 2001). Glycoside hydrolases are important drug targets (Williams & Davies, 2001) and we hope that compounds based upon the threedimensional structures of glycoside hydrolases in complex with oligosaccharides, such as that described here, will aid the design of novel inhibitors both as mechanistic probes and therapeutic agents in the future.

The enzymatic nucleophile (Glu228) and the acid/base (Glu139) are shown for reference.

Ê carbon, C1, lies 6.2 A from the putative attacking O atom of the nucleophile Glu228 Ê and 4.6 A from the acid/base Glu139. In the +1 subsite, there are no direct interactions with the protein except for a hydrophobic stacking platform provided by Trp178, which has rotated approximately 6 around the CGÐCD bond compared with the native structure in order to optimize the interaction. The +1 sugar hydrogen bonds only to solvent-accessible water molecules.

It is possible that this lack of direct hydrogen bonding may serve to assist product release and prevent tight binding of the sugar in this `leaving-group' subsite. For the ®rst time in glycoside hydrolase family 5 (nomenclature according to Coutinho & Henrissat, 1999), we observe a glucosyl moiety in the +2 subsite. The O2 hydroxyl is hydrogen bonded to Gln180 OE1, whilst the O6 hydroxyl interacts only with water. The O3 hydroxyl is directly hydrogen bonded to Gln180 NE2 and His206 NE2. A schematic representation of the interactions is shown in Fig. 4. This con®rms the role of this residue in substrate binding, predicted through a series of suppressor mutants of a family 5 endocellulase, EGZ, from Erwinia chrysanthemi (BortoliGerman et al., 1995). It is possible that in a productive complex the histidine would bind O2 rather than O3. A feature of the À1, +1 and +2 subsites is an unusual water Figure 4 network in which water moleA schematic representation of the interactions of Cel5A with the cules bridge the O6 of each sugar SDP5 inhibitor. Only the displaced À1, +1 and +2 subsites are with either the O3 or O2 shown for clarity.
