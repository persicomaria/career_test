Abstract Protein S, a two-domain spore coat protein from Myxococcus xanthus, is structurally related to eye-lens LQcrystallins. No natural monomeric one-domain member of this protein superfamily is known. To determine the stability of the single domains and to explain the ubiquitous domain duplication, the isolated domains of protein S were constructed. The Ndomain is thermodynamically more stable than the C-domain. In intact protein S, domain interactions lead to an apparent decrease in stability of the N-terminal domain, whereas the Cterminal domain is stabilised. In contrast, unfolding kinetics of both domains are decreased 100-fold due to interactions in the complete molecule. z 1998 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Introduction Polypeptide chains beyond a critical length of 50^100 amino acid residues tend to form domains as structurally independent entities [1,2]. The LQ-crystallin superfamily is a most illuminating example to illustrate this hierarchical principle of protein structure and domain duplication [3], especially because it allows the oligomerisation of crystallins and their homologs to be explained by `molecular domain swapping' [2,4]. Protein S, the spore coat forming protein of the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus, is structurally related to the superfamily of LQ-eye-lens crystallins [5^7]. It shares not only their Greek-key topology and their domain size but also their high intrinsic stability [2]. However, in contrast to the crystallins, it polymerises in a CaP -dependent manner to form a durable cuticula, thus protecting the syncytium upon desiccation or other stress conditions [8]. The domains of LQ-crystallins exhibit a surprisingly high structural homology. However, under suitable conditions, independent domain folding has been observed. Examples to illustrate this feature are bovine QB-crystallin [9] and protein S [10]. The well-separated equilibrium transitions of their domains suggest signi¢cant di¡erences in their intrinsic stabilities. In the case of QB-crystallin, di¡erences in the thermodynamic stability and the 3D structure of the domains were determined using carefully selected domain boundaries [11,12]. In order to examine the stability of the isolated N- and Cterminal domains (NPS and CPS) of protein S, we cloned the

domains and puri¢ed the recombinant proteins after expression in Escherichia coli. Since CPS turned out to be signi¢cantly less stable than NPS, it was supplemented with a HisT tag in order to speed up the puri¢cation and to enhance the yield. As shown by absorbance, £uorescence emission and circular dichroism spectroscopy, the isolated domains exhibit characteristics of native protein S. They are monomeric entities without any tendency to combine to the `nicked' twodomain parent molecule; both are stabilised by CaP binding (manuscript in preparation). 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cloning and puri¢cation Molecular cloning procedures were based on Sambrook et al. [13]. The plasmid pETPS used for cytoplasmic expression of protein S has been described elsewhere [10]. The plasmids for expression of the isolated domains, pETNPS and pETCPS, were constructed by cloning the corresponding genes into the plasmid pET11a [14] via the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. For CPS, a sequence encoding a HisT tag was added at the C-terminus. Recombinant protein S and its N-terminal domain were expressed and puri¢ed as described for protein S [10]. After expression in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) [15], the C-terminal domain was puri¢ed using a Ni-NTA resin and gel ¢ltration. 2.2. Di¡erential scanning calorimetry (DSC) DSC studies were performed using a Nano-DSC CSC 5100 calorimeter (Calorimetry Sciences Corp., Provo, UT, USA) at a constant heating rate of 1 K/min. All experiments were carried out in 20 mM sodium cacodylate, 3 mM CaClP , pH 7.0. Samples were dialysed against a 1000-fold volume of bu¡er. Bu¡ers were ¢ltrated and degassed by evacuation; protein solutions were centrifuged and degassed before the concentration was determined by absorption spectroscopy. Solvent baselines and samples were measured under identical conditions. To examine the reversibility of folding, the protein was cooled down after the ¢rst unfolding transition, and heated up a second time. Data were analysed with the deconvolution software CpCalc 2.1 of the CSC 5100 [16]. 2.3. Kinetic experiments Folding and unfolding kinetics were monitored using absorption spectroscopy (286 nm, path length 1 cm) for protein S and NPS, and far-UV CD spectroscopy (222 nm, path length 0.1 cm) for CPS: Cary 1/3 Varian spectrophotometer and AVIV 62D spectropolarimeter. All experiments were carried out in 25 mM MOPS, 3 mM CaClP , pH 7.0 at 20³C. Unfolding of native protein and refolding of unfolded protein (CPS in 5 M urea, protein S in 7.5 M urea and NPS in 7 M urea) were initiated by dilution with solutions containing varying concentrations of urea to give the appropriate folding conditions and ¢nal protein concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml for CPS and 0.6 mg/ml for protein S and NPS. The individual kinetics were analysed as mono-exponential or double-exponential functions for NPS, CPS and protein S, respectively. The dependence of the rate constants k on the urea concentration were analysed assuming a two-state mechanism of folding and a linear dependence of the logarithms of the microscopic rate constants of unfolding ku and of refolding kf on urea concentration. In the ¢gures, the ¢tted curves resulting from this analysis are given as solid lines. Stopped-£ow kinetic experiments for the fast refolding of the Nterminal domain were performed using a SX-18MV sequential mixing stopped-£ow spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). The path length of the observation chamber was 1 cm, and the ki-

To initiate refolding, solutions of 5 mg/ml unfolded NPS in 7 M urea were diluted 11-fold with urea solutions of varying concentrations to give ¢nal concentrations of 0.6^4 M. Kinetics were measured six times under identical conditions, averaged and analysed as mono-exponential functions using the software provided by Applied Photophysics.

3. Results and discussion Thermal analysis by DSC and denaturation/renaturation kinetics were applied in order to quantify the stability of NPS and CPS. Fig. 1 and Table 1 illustrate the reversible thermal denaturation of CaP -liganded protein S and its isolated domains at pH 7.0. While the DSC pro¢les of NPS and CPS are monophasic and show two-state behaviour (NHU), the unfolding of protein S can only be ¢tted assuming a three-state model (NHIHU), with two nearly coinciding equilibrium transitions at 65 and 66³C. The corresponding enthalpy changes, vH = 26 and 19 kJ/mol, re£ect the nearly cooperative unfolding of the two domains, with the ¢rst transition attributable to the melting of CPS (including the loss of domain interactions), the second transition to the unfolding of NPS. Comparing the DSC pro¢les of the isolated domains, similar values for the change in molar heat capacity, vCp , and for vH are observed, as one would expect for proteins with similar size and fold [17]. On the other hand, there is a striking di¡erence of 20 degrees between the melting points of the two domains, re£ecting the signi¢cantly higher thermodynamic stability of the N-terminal domain compared to its C-terminal counterpart. In addition, in the complete two-domain protein, NPS apparently loses stability by its interaction with CPS: its Tw is shifted from 70 to 66³C (Table 1). Summarising the DSC data, protein S exhibits a close similarity to other modular proteins which were previously shown to gain stability by mutual interactions of their domains, to the extent that in certain cases separate domains were found to require their counterparts as `chaperones' [18]. A second alternative to gain insight into the signi¢cance of domains in connection with the stability and folding of modular proteins is the analysis of denaturation/renaturation kinetics. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the apparent rate constants k of unfolding and folding on the denaturant concentration. For the isolated domains only mono-exponential kinetics were observed, as for other all-L proteins with fewer than 90 amino acid residues [19]. In contrast, in the case of the complete two-domain protein S, only the unfolding kinetics can be ¢tted with mono-exponential functions, where-

as refolding shows biphasic kinetics up to a urea concentration of 3.5 M. In addition, the `roll-over' at low denaturant concentrations clearly indicates the occurrence of folding intermediates at cure 6 2 M [20], thus rendering the extrapolation of ln k to zero denaturant concentration impossible [21]. Only for NPS and CPS, thermodynamic parameters are accessible by extrapolation to cure = 0 (Table 1). The results are in agreement with data obtained from the urea-induced equilibrium transitions (manuscript in preparation). However, comparing the kinetics of the separate domains at cure C0 with those of intact protein S, a most surprising result is obtained: both the highly stable NPS and the unstable CPS unfold at the same rate (ku W9U103S s3I ; cf. Fig. 2A,C), whereas in intact protein S the unfolding of the cooperative unit of the interacting domains is slowed down 100-fold (ku W9U103U s3I , cf. Fig. 2B). This leads us to suggest that intact protein S is stabilised kinetically due to a high energy barrier between the native and unfolded states. As a consequence, its folding rate is expected to be slowed down [22]. A comparison of the folding rates of NPS (kf = 21 s3I ) and CPS (kf = 0.13 s3I ) with the respective slow and fast kinetic phases calculated for protein S at low urea concentration is in accordance with this idea (kf W2.5U103Q and 1.4U103P s3I ). The deviation from two-state behaviour in the case of protein S clearly indicates a complex folding mechanism with intermediates highly populated under native-like solvent conditions. In this connection,

with a decrease in rate compared to isolated CPS, may be attributed to the C-terminal domain, the rate-limiting step to the pairing of the domains. Based on this mechanism, the kinetic stabilisation of protein S seems to reside mainly in speci¢c domain interactions. According to the 3D structure of the protein [6,7] the C-terminal tyrosine 121 (involved in two hydrogen bonds with N-terminal backbone amide groups in the interface) might be a good candidate for these speci¢c interactions. Preliminary mutation studies involving this position indicate a destabilisation of protein S and independent domain folding (unpublished data). 4. Conclusions In conclusion, despite their structural similarity, the two domains of protein S exhibit drastic di¡erences in their folding kinetics and intrinsic stabilities. The latter are equalised in the intact protein, leading to an apparent monophasic equilibrium unfolding transition of the intact two-domain protein. In spite of the slight upward shift of the melting temperature observed for NPS compared with the N-terminal domain within intact protein S, both domains gain stability in the intact protein because of the kinetic barrier which slows down the unfolding transition. Comparing these results with the properties of the structurally related QB-crystallin, signi¢cant di¡erences become obvious: in QB-crystallin, the N-terminal domain is not a¡ected in its stability, whereas the stability of the isolated C-terminal domain is strongly decreased [11]; hydrophobic domain interactions contribute signi¢cantly to the intrinsic stability [23]. The question why domains with identical folds di¡er in their stability properties remains open. It may be correlated with di¡erent functions, in the case of protein S possibly connected with the stress-induced folding and polymerisation.
