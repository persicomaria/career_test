The structure of the blue copper protein, azurin, fi'om Alcaligenes denitrificans has been determined fi:om an electron density map at a nominal resolution of 3"0 A. Four isomorphous heavy-atom derivatives, prepared with KAu(CN)2, uranyl acetate, Hg(NH3)2C12 and KAu(CNh+uranyl acetate (a double derivative) were used to calculate phases by the method of isomorphous replacement. The overall figure of merit was 0"61. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by an approximate 2-fold axis. Independent interpretations of the density were made for the two molecules, and the structures have since been partially refined. After 12 refinement cycles, using the Hendrickson-Konnert restrained least-squares program, the R factor is 0'318 for data to 2'5 A resolution and there are no major confbrmational differences between the two molecules. Refinement is continuing. Eight extended strands of the polypeptide chain form a fl-barrel structure whose topology is the same as that of plastocyanin and the alternative folding proposed for Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin. As in the latter two proteins, the copper atom forms three short bonds, with His46 N~I, Hisll7 N~I and Cysll2 Sy, and one longer bond, with Metl21 $6, these four ligands forming a very distorted tetrahedron. A possible additional interaction, between copper and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly45, cannot be discounted at the present stage of the analysis. A surface hydrophobic patch, around the edge of the imidazole ring of Hisll7 appears the most likely electron transfer locus. The sequences of azurin and plastocyanin have been aligned and the homology between the two proteins is discussed.

1. Introduction
Azurins are a group of low molecular weight (ca. 14,000) copper proteins found in various bacterial species (for reviews see, for example, Fee, 1975; Lappin, 1981). Comparison of the amino acid sequences of nine different azurins (Ryden & Lundgren, 1976) shows a high degree of homology, with 47 out of 129 residues being identical in all species and a further 32 conservatively substituted. A degree of homology has also been noted (Ryden & Lundgren, 1979) between azurin and several other copper proteins, including both small single-copper proteins, such as p l a s t o c y a n i n and stellacyanin, and larger multi-copper oxidases, such as ceruloplasmin and c y t o c h r o m e oxidase. Although the homology is not extensive 501 0022-2836/83/110501-21 $03.00/0 © 1983 Academic Press Inc. (London) Inc.

(only 9 residues being identical between the azurins and plastocyanins), it has been suggested that all these protein~ am evolutionarily related. Azurins have a general function as electron transfer proteins, although the precise details are not entirely clear. It is generally believed that azurin receives an electron from a small c-type cytochrome, cytochrome c551, which has been found in most bacterial species possessing azurins (Kamen et al., 1971), and passes it on to a cytochrome oxidase (Holwerda et al., 1976). Thus the electron transfer sequence may be: cytochrome c551 -+ azurin -+ cytochrome oxidase. Such a role for azurin would be analogous to that of plastocyanin in plants, where plastocyanin receives an electron fi'om a c-type cytochrome (the membrane-bound cytochromef) and passes it on to P700, the double chlorophyll pigment of photosystem I (Freeman, 1981). The structural and functional role of the single copper atom in azurin has been the subject of much debate. Azurin has the distinctive spectroscopic properties of other "blue" copper proteins ; namely, a very intense (e = 3500 to 6000 M- i cm - l) absorption band in the visible part of the spectrum (~625 nm) and a very low hyperfine splitting constant (ALl = 0"006 cm -t) in its electron spin resonance spectrum (Fee, 1975). It also has a relatively high redox potential, values varying between 0"230 V and 0"395 V for different azurins (Fee, 1975 ; Wherland & Pecht, 1978). These properties have been assumed to arise from a copper site specifically designed to allow rapid electron transfer (with accompanying changes between Cu(II) and Cu(I)) without major structural changes. A crystallographic analysis of the structure of azurin from Alcaligenes denitrificans has therefore been undertaken. The amino acid sequence of this azurin is known (Ambler, 1971) and a detailed structure analysis should then help to elucidate the nature of the copper site, identify possible macromolecular binding sites and electron transfer pathways in the azurin molecule, and complement the large number of chemical, spectroscopic and kinetic studies on azurin. While this work was in progress, the results of two related crystallographic studies were reported; namely, the structure of plastocyanin from poplar leaves, at 2-7 A resolution (Colman et al., 1978), and that of azurin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, at 3"0 A resolution (Adman et al., 1978). Both showed a very similar copper site, with the copper atom bound, in a distorted tetrahedral geometry, to two histidine side-chains, one cysteine and one methionine. Both proteins showed a similar fl-barrel structure for the polypeptide chain, with the addition, in azurin, of an extra "flap" of about 25 residues between strands 4 and 5 of the fl-barrel. The two structures differed, however, in the connectivity of strands 1 to 3, a difference arising apparently from ambiguity in the azurin electron density map. This ambiguity was partially, but not completely, resolved by refinement and extension of the phases of the X-ray data for azurin, from 3"0 to 2"7 A resolution (Adman & Jensen, 1981). The resulting improved map could be interpreted in terms of the plastocyanin folding pattern, but the interpretation was not unequivocal.

The present work resolves a n y uncertainty a b o u t the structural relationship between azurin and plastocyanin. Comparison of this azurin with Ps. aeruginosa azurin (whose sequence differs in 49 out of 129 residues) and with plastocyanin m a y help to identify features associated with the electron transfer process, confirm the exact nature of the copper site, and highlight a n y differences. Furthermore, since 2"0 A d a t a have been collected, the structure can ultimately be refined, and compared with the refined (1"6 A) structure of plastocyanin (Gusset al., unpublished data).

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Crystals and heavy-atom derivative preparation Azurin was purified and crystallized as described (Norris el al., 1979). The crystals are orthorhombic, with cell dimensions a = 75"0 A, b = 74"1 A, c --- 99-5 A, space group C2221, and 2 azurin molecules in the asymmetric unit. A feature of the diffraction pattern is the marked tetragonal pseudo-symmetry at low resolution. Attempts were made to remove the copper atom in order to substitute heavier metals. When azurin crystals were soaked in a large excess of 0-1 M-CN-, over a period of 1 week at room temperature, they became co]ourless. On keeping in standard mother liquor (0"l Mphosphate (pH 6"0), 75O/o saturated with ammonium sulphate), however, a light blue colour gradually returned and it was thought that the copper atom had merely been reduced rather than removed. More recently, however, we have shown by atomic absorption spectroscopy that the copper is removed under these conditions. (The return of the blue colour in previous experiments must have been due to traces of copper in the mother liquor.) The copper-free azurin crystals diffract well but show a 1% decrease in the c axial length. Heavy-atom derivatives for the structure analysis were prepared by soaking pre-formed azurin crystals in solutions of heavy-atom reagents dissolved in the standard mother liquor described above. For compounds with insoluble phosphates, such as uranyl salts, 0-05 Mammonium acetate (pH 5"5) was used in place of phosphate buffer. About 50 different heavy-atom reagents were tried. Most gave no intensity changes, yet platinum compounds, on the other hand, almost invariably broke up the crystals. In retrospect, this was probably because of the large number (5) of methionine side-chains on the surface of the azurin molecule at a region of close intermolecular contact. The derivatives finally used for the structure analysis are listed in Table 1. The best derivative was that prepared using KAu(CN)2, for which intensity changes were reasonably large, with no significant change in cell dimensions. Cell dimensions were unchanged for the uranyl acetate derivative but intensity changes were small. The "double derivative", prepared by soaking crystals in a solution containing both KAu(CN)2 and uranyl acetate, gave large intensity changes, but a change in cell dimensions approaching 0"5% suggested possible non-isomorphism. The same was true of the derivative prepared with Hg(NH3)2CI2, for which cell dimension changes were of the order of 0"7%. This derivative was used, albeit at low resolution only, because the crystals became colourless and it was thought that the copper atom may have been replaced by mercury. One other compound merits mention. Crystals soaked in thiomersalt turned colourless in a few weeks, and showed substantial intensity changes. The c axial length, bowever, increased from 99"5 to 100"l A. Shorter soaking times reduced this expansion but, during data collection, the

cell dimensions continued to change and the derivative was finally not used for phase determination. (b) Data collection With the exception of one native data set, collected on a Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer at the University of Auckland, all diffraction data were collected on a Hilger and Watts 4circle diffractometer at the Chemistry Division, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Wellington. In each case, integrated intensities were measured by an w-scan through the peak position, with stationary background measurements made on either side of the peak. To speed data collection and prolong crystal life, backgrounds were counted for a short time only (typically 5 s) and a background-averaging routine was then used during the data processing. A subset of weaker reflections (35 to 50O/o of the total data set), whose backgrounds were unlikely to be significantly affected by crystal mis-setting, were used to give a distribution of average backgrounds as a function of 0, ~ and X. These averaged backgrounds were then applied to the data set as a whole. The effect was to very much improve the agreement of equivalent reflections, particularly the weaker ones. Lorentz and polarization corrections were applied, and the intensities were also corrected for absoq~tion following the method of North et al. (1968). Being needles of approximately square cross-section, the crystals had fairly low peak-to-trough ratios for the absorption curves, typically 1"5: 1. Because of the scarcity of large crystals, data collection was continued for each crystal until the decrease in intensity arising from radiation damage, as judged by regular monitoring of the intensities of 3 standard reflections, reached about 300/o. These 3 standards generally showed similar intensity decrease, and were used to correct the data set as a whole. Native data were collected to 2-0 A, using a total of 4 crystals. For the first 2, covering 0 = 0 to 16"5° (2"7 A resolution), equivalent reflections hkl and hkT were measured and averaged. The merging R value, Rm, was 0"044 for data to 3"0 A resolution (where Rm = Z I l - ~/ZT). For data between 2'7 and 2"0 A resolution, which was generally very weak, only one measurement of each reflection hkl was made, but long counting times were employed. A single crystal was used for each heavy-atom derivative, except for the double derivative, for which 2 crystals were required. Friedel-related reflections were checked by calculating mean values of ll,t./ and lr,Er in small blocks of reciprocal space (Matthews & Czerwinski, 1975). Only for the uranyl acetate derivative were there any significant and systematic discrepancies, and local scaling was

therefore employed to make mean values of I~,~. and Iz~t equal within each block. The i derivative data were finally scaled to the native following the procedures described by Wyckoff et al. (1970). Plots of the average intensity as a function of resolution showed no significant difference between native and derivative crystals. (c) Interpretation and refinement of heavy-atom derivatives The 3-dimensional difference Patterson calculated from the KAu(CN)2 derivative showed 1 major site: 2 minor sites were then deduced from "residual" (or double difference Fourier) syntheses (Petsko, 1976). The other derivatives were interpreted from difference Pattersons, and difference Fouriers phased by the KAu(CN)2 derivative, using both isomorphous and anomalous differences (Matthews, 1966). The absolute configuration was determined by calculating 2 difference Fourier syntheses for the uranyl acetate derivative, based on the 2 possible configurations for the KAu(CN)2 derivative. One map was much cleaner, with peaks much more compatible with the difference Patterson, thus clearly establishing the correct absolute configuration. The derivatives were refined independently, using a full matrix least-squares program based on O R F L S (program developed by Busing, Martin & Levy, of Oak Ridge Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee). The quantity minimized was 2:(IAFol--fu)2, where ]AFol is the observed isomorphous difference (IAFo[ = IIFeHI--IFPII), and fH is the calculated heavy-atom structure amplitude. Centric data only were used, the data from the 3 centric projections being combined to give a pseudo-3-dimensional centrosymmetrie data set. All reflections were given equal weight in the refinements, but those with spacings greater than l0 A were omitted. As the refinements continued, minor sites were added from residual TABLE 2

Minor sites were added, however, only if they were also compatible with the respective difference Pattersons. Final centric R values (R: = ZI[/IFol--fH[/X[AFo[) were 0-510, 0"558, 0'560 and 0"503 for the KAu(Cn)2, uranyl acetate, double and Hg(NH3)2C12 derivatives, respectively. These correspond to resolution limits of 3"0, 3"1, 3-0 and 4"7 A for the 4 derivatives. Heavy-atom parametem are given in Table 2. Inspection of the heavy-atom parameters reveals that many of the sites are related by non-crystallographic symmetry. Sites labelled A and A', B and B', etc. in Table 2 are related by an approximate non-crystallographic 2-fold axis along the diagonal between the a and b axes, at a height z/c = 1/8. (This is also consistent with the pseudosymmetry in the diffraction pattern.) As has been noted in other similar cases, occupancies are frequently
uneven,

(d) Calculation of the electron density map "Best" phases for the native protein data were calculated by the method of Blow & Crick (1959), with anomalous scattering measurements for each derivative also being taken into account (Matthews, 1966). Values of Ej,. the root-mean-square error in the isomorphous differences for t h e j t h derivative, were taken as the r.m.s.t lack of closure of the isomoq0hous replacement triangle averaged over centrosymmetric reflections for t h a t derivative. Values of Ej, the r.m.s, error in the anomalous differences for" t h e j t h derivative, were taken as the r.m.s, difference between observed and calculated anomalous differences. The ratios fH/E and f~/E' (where fH is the r.m.s, calculated heavy-atom contribution and f{~ is the r.m.s, calculated anomalous contribution) for each derivative, together with the figure of merit, are shown in Fig. 1, plotted against resolution.

acetate and double derivatives, fn/E approaches unity at 3"3, 4"0 and 4"0 A resolution, respectively. The anomalous ratios f~/E' are all less than l, except at very low resolution; that the anomalous differences do contribute usefully to the phasing, however, is shown by the very much cleaner difference Fouriers obtained when the correct hand for a derivative is used in phasing. The mean figure of merit for the 5335 reflections to 3"0 A resolution (omitting those with spacings greater than 10 A) was 0"614, and the overall value of the ratio (r.m.s. lack-of~closure)/E was 0-82. A mini-map, on a scale of 4A/cm, was first calculated. The 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit were seen to be related by the same approximate 2-fold axis deduced from the heavy-atom binding sites. The densities for both appeared interpretable, in that the polypeptide chain could be seen as an almost continuous chain of electron density, along which some of the larger side-chains were clearly recognizable in terms of the known amino acid sequence (Ambler, 1971). The highest density in each molecule appeared at the positions of the 2 major binding sites of the Hg(NH3)2CI2 derivative, consistent with the identification of these as the copper sites. A large-scale (2 cm/A) electron density map was then plotted for the molecule having Cu at (0"019, 0"160, 0"122), designated molecule I, with sections calculated along the y axis at intervals of 0-75 A. The maximum density was 0"68 e/A a, compared with an error of 0"06 e/A a, calculated by the method of Dickerson et al. (1961). The map was contoured by hand, at intervals of 0"10 e/A a, starting from the lowest contour level of 0"10 e/A a, and the contours were transferred to acetate sheets. These were hung in a Richards optical comparator (Richards, 1968), utilizing a vertical mirror (Colman et al., 1972). Later, a similar large-scale map was plotted for molecule II, the second molecule in the asymmetric unit, having Cu at (0"336, 0-525, 0"371). 3. I n t e r p r e t a t i o n o f the E l e c t r o n

Density Map

The m a p s for the two molecules were interpreted in turn, by fitting K e n d r e w skeletal model c o m p o n e n t s to the electron density, residue b y residue. The two interpretations were essentially independent, except t h a t in each molecule there were several places where the main chain density dropped below the lowest contour level (although it was still positive). Here, reference was m a d e to the equivalent region on the other molecule, the observation of good, well-resolved density then confirming the interpretation. I n no case was u n c e r t a i n t y in the course of the main chain found a t the same position in each molecule. The electron density m a p , which is of average quality, really divides into two p a r t s ; (1) the extended strands of the fl-barrel, the s-helix in the " f l a p " region and the loop of chain around the copper a t o m , all of which had clear, well-resolved density; and (2) the external loops connecting the fl-strands, and linking the flap to the main b o d y of the molecule, for which the density, although generally continuous, was poorly resolved and very difficult to fit unambiguously. A p a r t of the m a p is shown in Figure 2. Model-building for each molecule began at the copper atom. Three of the copper ligands are contributed b y a short loop of polypeptide chain, comprising residues 112 to 121. These three ligands, Cys112, His117 and Metl21, had been suggested b y amino acid sequence comparisons (Ryden & Lundgren, 1976) and confirmed b y the structure analyses of Ps. aeruginosa azurin (Adman et al., 1978) and plastocyanin (Colman et al., 1978). Model building began with this loop, b u t no other reference was m a d e to the Ps. aeruginosa azurin or plastocyanin structures during model building. There are, in fact, five pieces of density t h a t coalesce with t h a t of the copper a t o m in each molecule; the three ligands mentioned above, the

places ; residues 68 to 72 and 77 to 81, both in the flap region (e.g. the side-chain of Leu68 in molecule I occupied the position assigned to the side-chain of Tyr72 in molecule II, other side-chains were in different positions, and the main chain was organized differently), and residues 103 to 105 in the loop connecting strands 6 and 7 of the fl-barrel. Refinement has now resolved these differences (see Refinement). Atomic co-ordinates were obtained by placing markers on the map, coincident with the reflection of the model, using as the prime criterion t h a t atoms should be as centrally placed in the density as possible. The structure of each molecule was regularized by the method of Dodson el al. (1976), with the r.m.s, shift in atomic positions required to give standard bond lengths and angles being 0"21 A for molecule I and 0"18 A for molecule II. The two molecules were then superimposed, using a non-linear least-squares program based on the method of Rao & Rossmann (1973). Reasonable agreement through much of the structure is shown by the fact t h a t 299 out of 516 main chain atoms differed in position by less than l'0 A. On the other hand, 78 main chain atoms differed by more than 2"8 A. These were mainly carbonyl oxygens or atoms from the three regions where the interpretation was different (see above). The average deviation in main chain atom positions was 1"41 A, and in side-chain atoms it was 1"76 -h. 4. Refinement Some initial refinement of the structure has been carried o u t using the H e n d r i c k s o n - K o n n e r t restrained least-squares refinement program (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980). The initial value of the reliability index R (where R =2:[IFol-lFcll/ZlFo[ ) was 0"408 for 3550 reflections between 6 A and 3"2A resolution. The resolution limit was extended to 2"5 A over the course of four least-squares cycles, at the end of which R was 0"390 for 7458 reflections between l0 A and 2"5 A. A difference map then indicated t h a t some parts of the structure should be rebuilt (regions where there was disagreement between the 2 molecules were checked especially carefully) and, after a further eight cycles of least-squares refinement, refining atomic co-ordinates, scale factor and overall temperature factor, the R value is now 0"318. I t is significant t h a t although the two molecules were not constrained together during refinement, the average deviation between main chain atom positions (after superposing the 2 molecules as before) is now only 0"82 A, and no major difference between the two conformations now exists.

T h e S t r u c t u r e o f A z u r i n The structure analysis of Ale. denitrificans azurin has helped to resolve any uncertainty arising from the two alternative polypeptide chain conformations t h a t could be fitted to the Ps. aeruginosa azurin electron density map (Adman & Jensen, 1981). I t has also clarified the relationship between azurin and plastocyanin. A detailed comparison of the two azurins must await further refinement of the two proteins, but it is clear from the descriptions of Ps. aeruginosa azurin t h a t the general features described below are common to both.

the fl-barrel generally run antiparallel, except for strands 1 and 3, and 2 and 8, which run parallel. A tentative hydrogen-bonding pattern is also shown in Figure 3. While some details may be changed when refinement is complete, it is clear that hydrogen bonding between some pairs of adjacent strands is irregular or non-existent. Thus, although strands 1, 3 and 6 form a classical piece of twisted fl-sheet with a regular network of hydrogen bonds, there is no hydrogen bonding at all between strands 5 and 6 (the separation of the strands being about 6 to 7 A), while strand 2 hydrogen bonds with strand 8 at its C-terminal end and strand 1 at its N-terminal end, with the two parts separated by a pronounced kink at residues 16-17. The structure is perhaps better described as a "/]-sandwich", with two fl-sheets packed face-to-face, as suggested by Chothia & Lesk (1982). One fl-sheet would then consist of strands 1, 3, 6 and the N-terminal portion of strand 2, and the other of strands 5, 4, 7, 8 and the C-terminal portion of strand 2. Between strands 4 and 5 is a flap of about 30 residues (52 to 81). This flap, which hangs off the main body of the molecule, separated from the fl-barrel by an interface of non-polar side-chains, contains the one piece of helix in the molecule, residues 55 to 67 forming about three helical turns. The hydrogen-bonding pattern (Fig. 3) corresponds to an a-helix, except near the C-terminal end, where it more closely resembles a 310 helix. The rest of the flap, residues 68 to 81, forms irregular loops, which provided the main areas of disagreement between the initial models for the two molecules. A plot of s-carbon atom positions is shown in Figure 4. (b) The copper site The copper site lies at the top end of the fl-barrel (see Fig. 4), near the ends of strands 4, 7 and 8.

and Metl21, are contributed by the loop comprising residues ll2 to 121, linking strands 7 and 8. As in plastocyanin, the copper atom forms three short bonds (approx. 2"0 to 2"2 A) with the N~t atoms of His46 and Hisll7, and the thiolate sulphur of Cysll2. The analogues in plastocyanin are His37, His87 and Cys84. Tile copper atom is approximately coplanar with these three ligands at the present stage of refinement. A longer' bond (approx. 3 A) is formed with a tburth ligand, the thioether sulphur of Metl21 (the analogue of Met92 in plastocyanin). As in both plastocyanin and Ps. aeruginosa azurin, these four" ligands form a very distorted tetrahedron about the copper atom, with bond angles that vary between approximately 80° and 125°. Such a geometry is consistent with most spectroscopic data (see, for example, Solomon el al., 1976 ; Brill, 1977), which have been interpreted as implying distorted tetrahedral geometry. It is also consistent with the expected requirements for rapid electron transfer'; namely, that the copper co-ordination geometry should be intermediate between those normally preferred by the Cu(I) and Cu(II) states (Moore & Williams, 1976). An intriguing feature of the 3"0 A electron density map is that, in addition to that of the four copper ligands described above, a fifth piece of density overlaps with that of the copper' atom, i.e. density associated with the peptide linkage between Gly45 and His46. A similar situation may occur in Ps. aeruginosa azurin (Adman & Jensen, 1981), where this peptide is close to the copper atom, with either its amide nitrogen or carbonyl oxygen about 3"3 A away (the peptide plane could be oriented either way). In Alc. denitrificans azurin (this work), the carbonyl oxygen of Gly45 is directed towards the copper atom, the orientation being the same in both molecules. This allows the amide nitrogen of residue 46 to hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 87. The Cu-O distance at the present stage of the analysis is short enough (about 3-1 A) to imply a weak bond, but must be regarded with suspicion until refinement at higher resolution is complete. Small movements in the copper position or in the orientation of the peptide plane could easily increase this distance to the order of 3-5 A. Whether or not a weak Cu-O bond exists, the closeness of 45 0 to the copper atom probably accounts (as pointed out by Adman & Jensen, 1981) for the nuclear magnetic resonance peak observed by Ugurbil et al. (1977), which was attributed to a peptide carbonyl adjacent to copper'. I t is also likely to influence the redox potential. The copper co-ordination sphere, including the 45-46 peptide, is shown in Figure 5, with the copper sites of the two molecules superimposed. If the carbonyl oxygen position does not change significantly on refinement, the geometry would be better described as distorted trigonal bipyramidal, with three strongly bound ligands (46 N61, ll2 S r and ll7 N61) coplanar with the copper, and two weakly bound axial ligands (121 S~ and 45 0). Two of the copper ligands are further" constrained by hydrogen bonds. Thus N~2 of His46 is hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyl of Asnl0, while S~ of Cys112 is about 3"4 A fl'om the main chain amide nitrogen of Asn47, both distance and orientation suggesting a hydrogen bond. Similar N - H . . . S hydrogen bonds are observed in iron-sulphur proteins (Adman et al., 1975). The other two side-chains bound to copper are restricted in their orientations by non-bonded interactions.

Fll;. 5. A superposition of the copper sites of the 2 molectt]es in the asymmetric unit. The 4 ligands, His46. Hisll7, Cysll2 and Metl21. are arranged in a very distorted tetrahedron about the copper atom. and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly46 also makes an apparent close approach to copper. (This ,'emains to be tested by refinement of the structure.) The side-chain of Metl21 lies adjacent to the plane of the aromatic ring of T y r l 5 , a residue t h a t is always aromatic in both azurins and plastocyanins. The sidechain of H i s l l 7 has one edge exposed to the external solution, so t h a t N~2 is not hydrogen bonded to any protein atom. The imidazole ring is, however, sandwiched between the side-chains of Metl3 and P h e l l 4 , the latter having its aromatic ring parallel to the imidazole plane. In addition to these side-chain interactions, the main chain N H and CO groups of all four ligands are hydrogen bonded (see Fig. 3), giving an impression of a tightly constrained and rather crowded copper site. As in Ps. aeruginosa azurin, the environment of the copper site is quite hydrophobic. Furthermore, most of the residues within 10 A of the copper atom are either invariant in all azurins, or semi-conserved. The copper atom is some 7 A from the molecular surface, separated from it by the imidazole ring of the ligand Hisll7. (c) The interior of the molecule The azurin fl-barrel has the expected core of hydrophobic side-chains, comprising those of Ala5, Ile7, Met20, Va122, Phe29, Val31, Ile33, Trp48, Leu50, Ile81, Ala82, Ile87, Va195, Phe97, Va199, Leul02 and the aromatic rings of T y r l 5 , T y r l 0 8 and Tyr110. F u r t h e r hydrophobic side-chains (Va149, Va159, Ala60, Val80, Va186, P h e l l 0 and the ring of Tyr72) lie between the fl-barrel and the flap. Several polar side-chains make i m p o r t a n t hydrogen bonds in the interior of the molecule, notably Asn47, which is invariant in all azurins (as is its analogue in plastocyanin, Asn38), Thr84, also invariant, and S e r l l 3 , replaced only by Thr. Asn47 is hydrogen bonded, through 0~1, to the hydroxyl group of S e r l l 3 and through Nt2 to the carbonyl oxygen of residue 84. Thr84 is probably hydrogen bonded to the main chain N H of residue 48. (d) Surface features and possible electron transfer loci One of the most striking features of the structure of azurin is the hydrophobie " p a t c h " on the surface of the molecule, surrounding the exposed edge of the

Fie,. 6. The hydrophobic patch on the molecular surface of azurin, surrounding the exposed edge of the imidazole ring of His117. Side-chains contributing to the patch are those of Metl3, Met44, Phell4, Proll5 and Metl20 and, a little further away, Met39, Va143, Met64, Trpll8 and Alall9. Glyll6 (invariant in all azurins) also lies in this area.

imidazole ring of H i s l l 7 . This is shown in Figure 6. In Alc. denitrificans azurin, the patch consists of the side-chains of P h e l l 4 and Pro115 on one side of the imidazole ring, Met44, Metl3 and Metl20 on the other, Met39 and Val43 above it, and Met64, T r p l l 8 and A l a l l 9 below it. Of these, four are invariant in all azurins so far sequenced (residues 13, 44, 114 and 115) and four vary while remaining hydrophobic (residues 39, 43, 64 and 120). The invariant G l y l l 6 also lies in the middle of this patch. The conserved and hydrophobic nature of this area strongly suggests a binding surface, either for cytochrome c551 or for cytochrome oxidase. Cytochrome c551 has been described as having a hydrophobic front hemisphere surrounding the haem crevice (Almassy & Dickerson, 1978), so t h a t interaction with the hydrophobic patch on azurin might then allow electron transfer via the exposed haem edge of cytochrome c551 to the imidazole ring of His117, and thence to the copper atom. I t is also interesting to note t h a t in the crystals of Alc. denitrificans azurin, the two molecules related by the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis (along the x-y diagonal, at z = 1/8) pack with their hydrophobic patches in contact (see Fig. 7). Numerous approaches of 3-2 to 3"8 A are made between hydrophobic side-chains, and solvent is apparently excluded. This leads to a distance of 14"3 A between the copper atoms and a b o u t 7 h. between the edges of the H i s l l 7 imidazole rings. A very similar packing, in a different space group, is seen between molecules of Ps. aeruginosa azurin, where the distance between copper atoms is 15 A and similar hydrophohic contacts are made (Adman et al., 1978). Numerous kinetic experiments have implicated histidine side-chains in electron transfer b y azurin. Of the five histidine residues in Alc. denitrificans azurin, His46 and His117 are liganded to copper. His32, which is external, is replaced b y Asn, Asp or Glu in other azurins. His83, invariant in all azurins, has been implicated in

The molecules pack so that the 2 surface hydrophobic patches are in contact, with the exclusiori of solvent, and numerous contacts of 3"2 to 3"8 A between hydrophobic side-chains.

electron transfer by kinetic investigations of the pH dependence, using small molecule redox reagents (Lappin el al., 1979). It is, however, remote from the copper atom (about 13 A away), on the molecttlar surface between strand 5 of the fl-barrel and the flap, and His83 is therefore less likely to be involved. His35, also invariant, has been implicated by the kinetic experiments of Lappin et al. (1979) and by elegant studies on the reduction of azurin by Cr(II) (Farver & Pecht, 1981). His35 is also thought to be involved in pH-dependent transitions between active and inactive forms of reduced azurin (Rosen & Pecht, 1976; Silvestrini et al., 1981). In Alc. denitrificans azurin, His35 is oriented so that its imidazole ring is roughly parallel to that of the liganded His46, although overlap is restricted to one edge (see Fig. 8). I t is hydrogen bonded to 44 C=O and possibly to 37 NH. I t is, however, quite inaccessible to solvent, being covered by two adjacent main chain loops, residues 88 to 90 and 36 to 39, which would have to move apart to allow access to the imidazole ring. While this could occur when a macromolecular complex is formed, and electrons might then be transferred through the imidazole rings of His35 and His46 to the copper atom, it seems more likely from our structure t h a t this residue has a more indirect role. For example, conformational changes involving His35 might affect the hydrophobic patch 6 to 7 A away. It is perhaps relevant that the analogous residue in plastocyanin is Ala33. If the two proteins are evolutionarily related, and share the same basic electron transfer pathway(s), a direct role for this residue is unlikely. As in Ps. aeruginosa azurin, there are no concentrations of positive or negative charge on the molecular surface that might serve as binding or recognition sites. Although several lysine side-chains have little or no density, and their orientations are therefore uncertain, most of the i n v a r i a n t or semiconserved charged side-chains appear to form pairs of positive and negative groups.

groups (and in several cases amino groups as well) involved. The binding sites for KAu(CN)2 are all neutral, on the other hand, involving main chain C=O and NH groups, and uncharged side-chains. On this basis, sites C/C' and D/D' of the double derivative are probably uranyl, and site E is probably KAu(CN)2. The major sites for Hg(NH3)2C12 are in the copper positions of the two molecules, although slightly displaced. When the correct scale is used (from a protein structure factor calculation), and allowance is made for the displacement of copper, the occupancies represent only 44°/o and 71°/o replacement for the two molecules. There is no obvious reason for the difference. The binding of thiomersal renders the crystals colourless. In this case, the copper atom may be reduced, rather than replaced, since a difference Fourier shows the binding site to be 3"6 A from the copper position, and there is no "hole" to suggest displacement of the copper. The binding site (presumably the mercury position) lies between the sulphur atoms of the two copper ligands, Cys112 and Metl21. With this arrangement, the sulphur atom of thiomersal may then be able to interact with copper, the addition of an extra sulphur ligand reducing Cu(II) to Cu(I). There is no doubt, however, that the copper site must be much disturbed by the intrusion of such a relatively large molecule, as is perhaps shown by the increase in the c axial length.

6. Comparison with Plastocyanin
Both azurin and plastocyanin clearly have the same topology, with the polypeptide chain being folded into an eight-strand fl-barrel, or a sandwich of two fl-sheets. The major differences lie between residues 52 and 90 (azurin numbering), where there is no structural homology at all. In azurin, residues 52 to 81 form the prominent flap on the outside of the fl-barrel, while residues 82 to 88 form the extended fl-strand 5. In plastocyanin, no such flap exists, but strand 5 is longer (17 residues, 48 to 64) and much more irregular, with no fl-character. The two molecules are shown superimposed in Figure 9. Several analytical and statistical comparisons of the amino acid sequences of azurins and plastocyanins have been carried out (Ryden & Lundgren, 1976; Dayhoff, 1976). In the absence of structural information, such alignments are difficult because of the low degree of homology (neither alignment gave more than 9 invariant residues, including the 4 copper ligands) and the large number of deletions or insertions required (azurins have 128 or 129 residues, plastocyanins have 98 to 104). We have aligned the sequence using the three-dimensional structures as a guide (Fig. 10). While this manuscript was in preparation we became aware of a similar, independent comparison by Chothia & Lesk (I982), which gives the same alignment. Only nine residues are invariant between the two families. These are the copper ligands, His46 (His37 in plastocyanin), Cysll2 (84), Hisll7 (87) and Metl21 (92); Asn47 (38), which forms several hydrogen bonds in the interior of the molecule (see above); Val49 (40) at the interface between the fl-barrel and the flap; Tyrl08 (80) at the.lower end o f the fl-barrel; P r o l l 5 (86), which is in the short loop between two copper ligands (Cys112 and His117) and whose side-chain is part

(1982)). Plastocyanin also has a hydrophobic patch surrounding the edge of His87, similar to that in azurin around Hisll7. Analogous side-chains include Leul2 (Met13 in azurin), Phe35 (Met39), Pro36 (Met44), Pro86 (Proll5) and Ala90 (Metl20). This further supports the view that this patch is a binding or recognition site in both azurin and plastocyanin (Adman & Jensen, 1981; Freeman, 1981). Insertions and deletions are all accommodated in loops on the molecular surface. Residues that are inserted in azurin are shown as filled circles in Figure 3. The whole flap region of 30 residues is treated as an "insertion", since there is no homologous feature in plastocyanin. As noted above, however, the structures cannot really be matched at all in this region (strand 5 and the flap), so that insertions and deletions have little meaning. Azurin has additional residues at the amino terminus, and there are different numbers of residues in the loops linking the fl-strands and those around the copper site (residues 112 to 121). Of particular interest is the loop connecting strands 3 and 4. In azurin, this loop consists of ten residues (linking His35 to His46), while in plastocyanin only three residues join the analogous Ala33 to His37. These extra residues at the top of the molecule, above the copper site, are indicated in Figure 4. Any difference in the approach of the carbonyl oxygen, 4 5 0 , to the copper, compared with plastocyanin (where the corresponding distance 36 0 . . . C u is 3"8A) may be attributable to this extra loop. It is interesting to note that subunit II of cytochrome oxidase, which is homologous with azurin (Ryden & Lundgren, 1979), also possesses this extra loop.

7. Conclusions

The structure of azurin is clearly homologous with that of plastocyanin. Since the homology includes both the overall folding of the polypeptide chain and the general features of the active site (the copper site and the hydrophobic patch around the exposed edge of the histidine ligand), it seems probable that the two proteins are derived from a common ancestor, despite the low degree of sequence identity. The structure analysis cannot be regarded as complete without further refinement at higher resolution. I n particular, the question of whether the carbonyl oxygen, 45 O, is close enough to interact with the copper atom must be left open at present. Most spectroscopic studies have suggested a 4-co-ordinate, distorted tetrahedral site (see, for example, Solomon et al., 1976), and spectra for azurins are very similar to those of plastocyanins, for which 4-co-ordination is unequivocal. On the other hand, some spectroscopic results for azurin have been interpreted in terms of 5-co-ordination (Miskowski et al., 1975) and there are small differences in electrode potentials between azurins and plastocyanins (Fee, 1975). Crystals of Alc. denitrificans azurin can be reduced, by Cr(II), without loss of crystallinity or changes in cell dimensions, but so far it has proved difficult to maintain them in the reduced state long enough to collect much X-ray data. Experiments are continuing on this.
