Macrophages and neutrophils protect animals from microbial infection in part by issuing a burst of toxic superoxide radicals when challenged. To counteract this onslaught, many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens possess periplasmic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutases (SODs), which act on superoxide to yield molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the Cu,Zn SOD from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a major porcine pathogen, by molecular replacement at Ê 1.9 A resolution. The structure reveals that the dimeric bacterial enzymes form a structurally homologous class de®ned by a water-mediated dimer interface, and share with all Cu,Zn SODs the Greek-key b-barrel subunit fold with copper and zinc ions located at the base of a deep loopenclosed active-site channel. Our structure-based sequence alignment of the bacterial enzymes explains the monomeric nature of at least two of these, and suggests that there may be at least one additional structural class for the bacterial SODs. Two metal-mediated crystal contacts yielded our C2221 crystals, and the geometry of these sites could be engineered into proteins recalcitrant to crystallization in their native form. This work highlights structural differences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic Cu,Zn SODs, as well as similarities and differences among prokaryotic SODs, and lays the groundwork for development of antimicrobial drugs that speci®cally target periplasmic Cu,Zn SODs of bacterial pathogens.

Introduction
Periplasmic Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase has been reported in diverse pathogenic Gram-negative prokaryotes, including Brucella abortus (Stabel et al., 1994), Legionella sp. (St. John & Steinman, 1996), Escherichia coli (Benov et al., 1995), Salmonella sp. (Canvin et al., 1996), Neisseria meningitidis and several species of the HAP group which includes Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, and Pasteurella (Kroll et al., 1991, 1995; Langford et al., 1996). In several cases, including S. typhimurium, S. choleraesuis, S. dublin (Farrant et al., 1997), N. meningitidis (Wilks et al.,

1998), and arguably B. abortus (Tatum et al., 1992; Latimer et al., 1992), mutants in sodC, the gene encoding Cu,Zn SOD, have attenuated virulence. Increased sensitivity to exogenous superoxide argues that one function of the periplasmic SOD is to shield these bacteria from the host animal's protective phagocyte superoxide burst (Farrant et al., 1997; Wilks et al., 1998; San Mateo et al., 1998). This is in contrast to the function of the sodA and sodB gene products, prokaryotic cytoplasmic Mn or Fecofactored SODs that clear the cytosol of superoxide produced during normal oxidative metabolism (Bloch et al., 1989; Hassett et al., 1995; D'Mello et al., 1997). X-ray crystal structures of two prokaryotic (Pclass) Cu,Zn SODs have revealed structural nearidentity and clear evolutionary conservation of the active-site and b-barrel fold of the bacterial

146 enzymes (Bourne et al., 1996; Pesce et al., 1997) with the much-studied eukaryotic (E-class) intracellular Cu,Zn SODs, exempli®ed in bovine, yeast, human and frog (Tainer et al., 1982; Ogihara et al., 1996; Parge et al., 1992; Carugo et al., 1994). A remarkable difference however was seen between the E-class and P-class dimerization surfaces, which are found on opposite sides of the b-barrel, mediated in E-class enzymes by a strong hydrophobic interface, but in the Photobacterium leiognathi structure by a combined hydrophobic and hydrophilic interface including several water-mediated hydrogen bonds (Bourne et al., 1996; Bordo et al., 1999). The E. coli enzyme lacks side-chains implicated in either dimerization motif and in fact is a

monomer in solution (Battistoni et al., 1996) as well as in crystalline form (Pesce et al., 1997). Likewise the charged residues that guide the substrate to the active-site are found in the loop between b-strands 5 and 6 in P-class (Figure 1(a)) but in the 7-8 loop in E-class proteins, indicating that the electrostatic attraction mechanism, like dimerization, is a consequence of convergent evolution. While molecular evolution of E-class SOD is fairly well-understood (Getzoff et al., 1989; Smith & Doolittle, 1992; Bordo et al., 1994), the interrelationship of the prokaryotic structures and the point of departure of the E-class SODs from the P-class proteins deserve further study.

The eight antiparallel b-strands are numbered based on their three-dimensional order of appearance around the b-barrel, and the sequence order is indicated with lower-case letters. The connections are afforded by a Greek-key loop from b3c to b6d and a Greek-key helix from b4f to b7g. Extra-barrel loops form the metal-containing active-site and the electrostatic attraction loop. (b) Ca trace of the SOD dimer, colored by thermal factor (gradual Ê Ê change from dark blue <20 A2 to red >95 A2 ), shows that the disorder is much higher in Sub(unit)1, in particular the extended loops from residues 20-25 and 70-75 (upper right). These loops border the large solvent channel in the crystals, whereas in Sub2, the loops form crystal contacts with a neighboring molecule and are well-ordered, with no ambiguity in the interpretation of the map. (c) Schematic ribbon rendering of the molecule showing dimer interface side-chains (green) and water molecules (red) as well as the disul®de bond (yellow) and metals (orange sphere, copper and silver sphere, zinc) and side-chains in the active-site (colored by atom type). Interface water molecules obey the non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. The charged residues (orange side-chains, top left, shown only for Sub2) at the tip of the electrostatic loop, together with the catalytic copper, form an electrostatically favorable pathway for substrate superoxide ions. The active-site channel is formed between loops on the side of the b-barrel. Copper ligands Ê His60 Nd1, His62 Ne2, and His141 Ne2 are 1.99-2.13 A from the Cu(II) ion, which is exposed at the bottom of the Ê active-site channel. The structural zinc is buried 6.4 A under the copper and ligated by His85 Nd1, His94 Nd1, His103 Ê Ê Nd1 and Asp106 Od1, with bond distances of 2.00 A for the Asp residue and 2.07-2.12 A for the histidine residues.

To extend the structural characterization of the P-class SODs, we solved the structure of a second dimeric enzyme, from the causative agent of a highly contagious respiratory infection in swine, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. We found that it shares the P-class dimerization motif with Photobacterium leiognathi SOD (PhSOD) including a set of 12 strikingly well-ordered water molecules at the interface. This not only establishes the watermediated interface as the de®ning characteristic of a class of enzymes, but also leads us to suggest the interface may be a suitable and novel target for antimicrobial drugs.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination A. pleuropneumoniae Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (ApSOD) was crystallized in space group C2221 from 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and phosphate buffer. Molecular replacement based on the 61 % identical (based on amino acid sequence of mature protein) PhSOD (Bourne et al., 1996) was used to solve the structure of the ApSOD dimer with a ®nal R-factor of 22.1 % (Table 1). The two subunits were independently re®ned and distinguished with the names Sub(unit)1 and Sub2. Sub1 is substantially less well-ordered than Sub2 (Figure 1(b)). N-terminal sequencing of puri®ed ApSOD indicated that the ®rst ®ve residues of the mature protein (Glu-His-Glu-His-Lys) are missing, presumably due to proteolysis (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing of dissolved crystals veri®ed that no further proteolysis occurs upon crystallization. Nonetheless, we observed only very weak electron density for residues 6-12 in both molecules, so the ®nal reported model begins with Glu13 for both Sub1 and Sub2 (numbering is based on the mature polypeptide sequence). Overall fold and conserved active-site The ApSOD monomer is an eight-stranded antiparallel b-barrel with the well-studied Greekkey fold connectivity (Getzoff et al., 1989) (Figure 1) seen in all Cu,Zn SOD structures, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, including bovine, yeast, frog, human, Photobacterium, and E. coli. The fold's name is based on the comparison of a design seen on ancient Greek vases (Richardson, 1977) with a schematic diagram of the b-strand connections, which skip over 3 strands as opposed to 1, thus stabilizing the barrel (Tainer et al., 1982). In the ApSOD b-barrel, as in all other Cu,Zn SODs, the Greek-key connections are b3c-b6d and b4f-b7g (Figure 1). Residues in loops between b-strands are functionally important for SOD activity. In ApSOD, a large disul®de-stabilized insert between b5e and b6d plays two roles (Figure 1(a) and (c)). Firstly, it holds charged side-chain residues Lys72, Asp73 and Lys75, which are proposed to guide the charged superoxide substrate into the active-site

electrostatically (Getzoff et al., 1989; Bourne et al., 1996). Secondly, this b5e-b6d insert contains a second loop with conserved zinc ligands. The b7gb8h loop holds a structurally conserved buried aspartate residue, which stabilizes the active-site through short charged hydrogen bonds with histidine ligands of the copper and zinc. Both P-class and E-class SODs have metal binding residues in the same sequence and structural order, indicating the active-site of SOD predates the emergence of eukaryotes. The catalytic mechanism of Cu,Zn SOD, established by numerous structural and spectroscopic studies (Getzoff et al., 1983; Tainer et al., 1983; Murphy et al., 1997; Hart et al., 1999) and shared by P-class (Venerini et al., 1999) and E-class Cu,Zn SODs, requires the successive reduction of tetrahedral Cu(II) to trigonal planar Cu(I) by superoxide, forming molecular oxygen, followed by re-oxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) by a second superoxide and 2H, forming hydrogen peroxide. This transition involves the breaking and reforming of a bond from the solvent-accessible copper to Ne2 of the bridging histidine residue, which is also a ligand for the buried active-site zinc. In our structure, the bridging histidine residue, His85, forms a bond only with the zinc Ê Ê (2.07 A) and not the copper ion (3.00 A and not in line) and the copper adopts the trigonal planar conformation characteristic of the fully reduced

148 enzyme (Ogihara et al., 1996). Five additional histidine residues and one aspartate residue complete the structurally conserved active-site of ApSOD (Figure 1(c)). In contrast to the conservation of the active-site, the loops contributing to electrostatic guidance differ between the P-class and E-class enzymes. The electrostatic guidance loop proposed for the P-class SODs is conserved in ApSOD, PhSOD and E. coli SOD, but contributes to the dimer interface in E-class SODs. The electrostatic guidance residues of E-class SODs are found in the b7g-b8h loop, across the active-site channel from their position in ApSOD but within comparable distance and orientation from the active-site channel (Getzoff et al., 1983). Water-mediated dimer interface Well-ordered water molecules form hydrogen bonds among themselves and to protein mainchain and side-chain atoms, knitting the subunits together and thus adding an unusual polar characteristic to the largely hydrophobic interface (Figures 1(c), and 2(a) and (b)). Indeed, the most striking difference between E-class SODs and PhSOD was the novel dimer interface located on the opposite side of the b-barrel in each case, and mediated partly by water-bridged hydrogen bonds in the Photobacterium enzyme (Bourne et al., 1996). It is noteworthy that ApSOD maintains a ring of well-de®ned water molecules in the dimer interface, superimposable on the water molecules in the dimer interface of the 61 % sequence identical PhSOD. These water molecules, although not encoded in the primary amino acid sequence, are a highly conserved aspect of the folded, functional protein. In ApSOD these waters maintain 2-fold symmetry, although this is not crystallographically imposed as it was in the P. leiognathi Cu,Zn SOD structure. This conservation of water molecule positions illustrates two fundamental structural concepts. Firstly, protein structure and protein-protein interactions are de®ned by not only protein atoms but also by structural water molecules. Secondly, conservation of structure extends beyond the conservation of amino acid conformation to conservation of functional solvent atom positions. Similar observations have been made by others, for example, in enzyme active-sites (Tainer et al., 1983; Brooks et al., 1986) and antigen-antibody interactions (Braden et al., 1995). The attractive forces of hydration at macromolecular surfaces (Israelachvili & Wennerstrom, 1996), while not well understood, are clearly a component of protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions. In ApSOD, side-chain residues implicated in dimer formation contribute hydrophobic packing at the interface (Tyr41, Val44, Leu56, Tyr96, Trp98, Ala109, Phe111, Leu123, and Pro125) and sidechain (Tyr41, Asp100, and Asn120) or main-chain (Ala109, Phe111, Pro121, Leu123 and Pro125)

hydrogen bonds to water molecules in the interface (Figure 2(b)). Of these, all but Phe111 are conserved among Cu,Zn SODs from a group of six respiratory-tract colonizing bacteria, although they are not generally conserved across all of the bacterial Cu,Zn SODs (further discussion below). As is the case for electrostatic guidance of substrate, the connections between b-strands prove important. At the bottom of the dimer Tyr41 falls in the b2-b3 connection and closes off the bottom of the interface with the large hydrophobic side-chain and by forming a hydrogen bond with Asp100 from the Zn-binding loop (Figure 1(c)). In the bacterial interface, the minimum main-chain-to-main-chain sepÊ aration distance is greater (approximately 5 A) Ê than in the eukaryotic interface (approximately 3 A in the yeast SOD structure), and the b-barrel axes of the two subunits are more nearly parallel. Cu-mediated crystal contacts Copper ions ligated by non-conserved histidine residues form two major crystal contacts in C2221 ApSOD crystals, stabilizing the packing and leading to high resolution diffraction, despite the fact that loops from Sub1 are highly mobile (Figure 1(b)). The ®rst of these highly occupied and well-re®ned copper ions is found on a crystallographic special position, ligated in a regular tetrahedral geometry by His48 and His50 from each of two 2-fold symmetry-related SOD molecules (Figure 2(c)). The histidine ligands are not conserved among bacterial SODs, and we wondered if ApSOD might be a lone tetrameric P-class SOD. However, gel ®ltration both in the presence and absence of excess copper con®rmed that ApSOD is a dimer in solution (data not shown). His48 and His50 from Sub2 form a second copper-mediated crystal contact whose third ligand is His114 from a symmetry-related Sub2. His48 and His50 are found at the end of b3 with side-chains oriented toward the solvent. Between them is Leu49, whose side-chain is part of the hydrophobic core of the barrel. As this very standard b-strand conformation occurs regularly in proteins, it is interesting to consider that the Hishydrophobic-His sequence could be engineered in surface b-strands of proteins otherwise recalcitrant to crystallization. Engineered crystallization has been successful in other systems, for example in 3D crystals of human ferritin (Lawson et al., 1991). Surface histidine residues can also facilitate crystallization on 2D lipid bilayers (Frey et al., 1996). Comparison with other P-class superoxide dismutases The sequence-based evolutionary relationship of 13 bacterial periplasmic Cu,Zn SODs conforms to the structure-based relationships (Figure 3(a)). Clearly, additional prokaryotic enzymes will also use the dimer interface and electrostatic attraction mechanisms described here based on shared resi-

due identities (Bordo et al., 1999). These include respiratory tract-colonizing species Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Actinobacillus species' SODs (Figure 3(b)), all of which are greater than 80 % identical to ApSOD and tightly clustered (Figure 3(a)). This group also includes Photobacterium (a symbiont of the Pony®sh which colonizes and forms the light organ) SOD, which is 61 % identical with ApSOD and near by in the sequence-based evolutionary comparison. Indeed, when the comparison is done based only on dimer interface residues, PhSOD clusters closer to ApSOD (Bordo et al., 1999). The specialized light gland in the Pony®sh is an outpouching of the oesophagus, and thus closely anatomically related to the upper respiratory tract, which is itself an outpouching, in embryological terms, of the foregut. Rooted near the origin of this evolutionary comparison are enzymes which have been shown to be monomeric, or which at least do not contain those residues associated with the ApSOD-class dimer;

E. coli, B. abortus, Salmonella, and Francisella tularensis Cu,Zn SODs (Figure 3(a)). Comparison of the ApSOD sequence with other bacterial SOD sequences explains the monomeric nature of the E. coli SOD (Pesce et al., 1997) and predicts the B. abortus enzyme to be a monomer (as suggested by Chen et al., 1995). Although both of these monomeric SODs have overall sequence identity with ApSOD of 53.2 %, each is missing several interface residues, including Tyr41, Val44, Tyr96, Trp98, and Asp100 (Figure 3(b)). The nature and stability of the dimer in Salmonella and Francisella SODs, as well as in the more distantly related Legionella and Caulobacter SODs, remains to be determined. Each of these is missing at least a subset of the prokaryotic dimer interface residues, in particular one or both of the large hydrophobic residues Tyr96 and Trp98. Assuming these enzymes are dimeric as reported for C. crescentus (Steinman & Ely, 1990), we would predict that the dimers are weaker if not differently stabilized. These bacteria are those noted by Langford

sucrose, 0.035 M EDTA, rocked for 20 minutes in the cold, pelleted again, resuspended in cold water, rocked for 20 minutes in the cold and pelleted once more. Following concentration, ApSOD from the supernatant was precipitated by gradual addition at 4  C of solid ammonium sulfate to a ®nal concentration of 650 g/l. Following overnight precipitation, the ammonium sulfate-containing precipitate was exhaustively dialyzed against six changes of distilled water. The dialysate was centrifuged to remove unsuspended protein, and an activity assay was run to verify the presence of Cu,Zn SOD (Beauchamp & Fridovich, 1971). Cation exchange chromatography on a Biocad HS-M column was run at pH 5.9 with an elution gradient from 50 mM to 200 mM NaCl in 33.3 mM Mes, 33.3 mM Hepes, 33.3 mM sodium acetate. Pure fractions from several runs were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and concentrated. N-terminal sequencing of the puri®ed protein was performed on a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems, 494 Procise sequencer using standard conditions. Crystallization and data collection Crystals were obtained by vapor diffusion at room temperature in hanging drops containing 3 ml of ApSOD at 17.2 mg/ml and 3 ml of mother liquor against a reservoir of 25 mM Na2PO4, 25 mM K2PO4, 44-54 % MPD, pH 4-5.5. Single chunky crystals (dimensions approximately 0.2 mm Â 0.1 mm Â 0.1 mm) suitable for data collection were obtained at 50 % MPD (pH 5.0). Preliminary data collection and analysis indicated that these crystals grew in the orthorhombic space group C2221 (Table 1). Systematic absences were consistent with the 21 screw axis. A single crystal, ¯ash-frozen in mother Ê liquor, was used to collect a 1.9 A-resolution diffraction data set on the MAR Research scanner at Beamline 7-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. DENZO and Scalepack (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) were used to index, integrate and scale re¯ections (Table 1). Molecular replacement phase determination The model used for molecular replacement in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994), was a dimer of the Cu,Zn SOD of P. leiognathi with the four metal ions removed. Using difÊ Ê fraction data from 15.0 A to 3.1 A, the highest rotation peak hit was 12.6 standard deviations above the mean, and the translation function based on 1 dimer per asymmetric unit (a.u.) yielded a single unambiguous solution. Rigid body re®nement of the dimer solution gave a correlation coef®cient of 44.0 and an R-factor of 58.8 %. All of the active-site metals, as well as two additional metal sites, were clearly visible in an Fo À Fc electron density map based on these phases. The 1 dimer/a.u. packing

et al. (1996) as inhabitants of niches such as fresh water or intracellular environments rather than the respiratory tract. Cu,Zn SODs of Francisella, Legionella and Caulobacter are separated from others by a seven or eight residue deletion in the b5-b6 loop (Figure 3(b)). The loss of these residues certainly affects the electrostatic guidance mechanism because the deleted residues would comprise one (Caulobacter) or two (Francisella, Legionella) charged lysine residues and an aspartate. Notably the b1-b2 loop in Francisella and Caulobacter SODs has acquired an additional lysine residue relative to most of the pathogen class. This position could affect electrostatic guidance, as this loop is also at the protein surface above the active-site channel (Figure 1(c)). Without further structural information it is impossible to know what if any electrostatic guidance mechanism is used by F. tularensis, C. crescentus and L. pneumophila SODs. It has long been noted that the C. crescentus SOD is the most evolutionarily distant of all the prokaryotic enzymes studied (Bordo et al., 1994; Kroll et al., 1995), with a sequence identity compared to ApSOD of 34.3 %. This is now structurally explicable. The C. crescentus protein has an eight-residue insertion of unknown function in the Greek-key helix which crosses the narrow bottom opening of the b-barrel. The ApSOD structure and evolutionary relationships presented here make it clear that despite decades of work with rich results and insights, the Cu,Zn SODs have even more to tell us about protein structure, function, and evolution.

Methods
Protein purification A volume of 4.5 l of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 100 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli QC779 harboring the ApSOD expression plasmid, pJSK157 (Langford et al., 1995). After growth at 37  C to an absorbance of 0.34, expression of Cu,Zn SOD was induced with 0.2 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactose and CuSO4 was added to 0.25 mM. After overnight growth at 37  C, CuSO4 was increased to 1.0 mM for the ®nal hour, at which point the absorbance had reached 5.17. Pelleted cells (15 minutes at 3000 g) were subjected to osmotic shock to release SOD found in the periplasm. Cells were resuspended in cold 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 20 % (w/v)

yields a crystal with 42.4 % solvent. No meaningful results were obtained when we searched for a third monomer or second dimer in the a.u. Fitting and refinement Following independent rigid body re®nement of the Ê Ê two subunits against 20 A-3.0 A resolution data, higher resolution data were added in two shells with conventional positional and individual temperature factor È re®nement in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992a) to yield a model È with R-factor of 43.4 % and Rfree (Brunger, 1992b) of 45.2 % (calculated with a random 5 % of the diffraction data omitted). At this point, most of the A. pleuropneumoniae Cu,Zn SOD side-chains could be modeled, although the electrostatic attraction loops of Sub1 were poorly ordered and had very weak electron density. The N-terminal seven amino acids of both molecules had no apparent density. After four additional rounds of manual ®tting and automated re®nement, a correction for anisotropic scattering was applied to the structure factors, and a bulk solvent correction was applied to the È model (Brunger, 1992a). Early in the re®nement, several very well-ordered water molecules were obvious at the dimer interface. Other water molecules were added only if they had electron density at ®ve standard deviations above the mean in Fo À Fc electron density maps and were appropriately positioned to make at least one hydrogen bond with protein. A total of ®ve additional rounds of manual ®tting against difference (Fo À Fc) omit maps alternated with positional re®nement and B-factor re®nement yielded the ®nal model (Table 1). The seven amino terminal residues are not included in this model, and two side-chains in the electrostatic loop of Sub1 are very poorly ordered. They were nonetheless included in the model by comparison to the well-ordered analogous loop in Sub1.
