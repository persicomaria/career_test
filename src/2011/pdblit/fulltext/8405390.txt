The crystal structure of a lipase from the bacterium Chromobacterium viscosum ATCC 6918 (CVL) has been determined by isomorphous replacement and refined at 1.6 Å resolution to an R-factor of 17.8%. The lipase has the overall topology of an a/b type protein, which was also found for previously determined lipase structures. The catalytic triad of the active center consists of the residues Ser87, Asp263 and His285. These residues are not exposed to the solvent, but a narrow channel connects them with the molecular surface. This conformation is very similar to the previously reported closed conformation of Pseudomonas glumae lipase (PGL), but superposition of the two lipase structures reveals several conformational differences. r.m.s. deviations greater than 2 Å are found for the Ca-atoms of the polypeptide chains from His15 to Asp28, from Leu49 to Ser54 and from Lys128 to Gln158. Compared to the PGL structure in the CVL structure, three a-helical fragments are shorter, one b-strand is longer and an additional antiparallel b-sheet is found. In contrast to PGL, CVL displays an oxyanion hole, which is stabilized by the amide nitrogen atoms of Leu17 and Gln88, and a cis-peptide bond between Gln291 and Leu292. CVL contains a Ca2 + , like the PGL, which is coordinated by four oxygen atoms from the protein and two water molecules.

For an understanding of the molecular architecture and the underlying principles of lipase activity, in particular the digestion of fatty acids at hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces, three-dimensional structures of several lipases from fungi (Brady et al., 1990; Brzozowski et al., 1991; Schrag et al., 1991; Grochulski et al., 1993; Uppenberg et al., 1994), mammalia (Winkler et al., 1990; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1993; Bourne et al., 1994) and bacteria (Noble et al., 1993; Bott et al., 1994) have been solved to date, both with and without covalently bound inhibitors. All these enzymes have a serine protease-like catalytic triad (Ser-His-Asp/ Glu), and undergo conformational changes on activation. These conformational changes increase the solvent accessibility of the active site and expose a large hydrophobic surface area, which is thought to promote interaction of the enzyme with lipid phase boundaries. The lipase of Chromobacterium viscosum ATCC 6918 is of industrial interest, owing to its potential

705 loop. Both residues have a clearly defined electron density. The average temperature factor for all main-chain ° ° atoms is 14.9 A2, and 16.5 A2 for all side-chain atoms. A plot of the average main-chain B-values versus the residue number (Figure 1) indicates residues 25-26, 77 to 79, 128 to 137, 149 to 155, 179 to 181, 196 to 199, 216 to 226 and 241-242 as flexible regions with high average main-chain and sidechain B-values. After purification, a molecular mass analysis of the homogeneous purified lipase by SDS-PAGE has shown that the CVL has been partly degraded, as a result of unspecific proteolytic digestion during the purification and/or storage (Figure 3). In addition, molecular mass analysis of redissolved crystals of CVL by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy revealed, with 32,839216 Da, a mass that is 252 Da lower than the mass calculated from the published amino acid sequence (Shizuoka et al., 1989; Mr , 33,091). The mass difference of 252 could correspond to the loss of the 220 to 222 tripeptide, possibly caused by unspecific proteolytic digestion of the CVL during purification and/or storage. This may be the reason that there is no electron density visible for the residues Val220, Leu221 and Gly222. Owing to their high disorder, the side-chain atoms of Lys128, Asp130, Thr132, Leu134 and Arg165, which are located at the surface of the molecule, are not visible in the electron density, either. Description of the structure The monomeric molecule has a nearly globular ° shape with approximate dimensions of 45 A × ° ° 50 A × 45 A. Its center is formed by a large hydrophobic b-sheet (Figure 4) consisting of six

in the detergent industry (Shizuoka et al., 1989). The enzyme was proven to be stable and active in organic solvents and shows a non-specific lipase activity towards triolein with a Gaussian-like activity profile between pH 5.5 and 9, as published by Prazeres et al. (1992). The amino acid sequence of the CVL is identical to that of the lipase from Pseudomonas glumae (Batenburg et al., 1991), which is classified into subgroup I of the Pseudomonas lipase family (Gilbert, 1993). The mature CVL enzyme consists of 319 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 33,091 Da (Shizuoka et al., 1989), one disulfide bridge and shows an enhanced activity in the presence of calcium ions (Sugiura & Isobe, 1974; Taipa et al., 1992, 1995). Investigations of the bacterial lipase from Chromobacterium viscosum ATCC 6918 have been performed on the purification (Haalck, 1994), crystallization (Lang et al., 1994), and tertiary structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Here, the high-resolution structure of this lipase will be discussed. From previously determined lipase structures, it can be assumed that CVL would most likely contain a Ser-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad. The active nucleophile of CVL, Ser87, is indicated by the lipase/esterase consensus sequence (G-x-S-x-G) (Derewenda & Derewenda, 1991). The catalytic histidine and aspartic or glutamic acid residues were not identifiable unambiguously from the sequence. Structurally, all of the lipases conform to the a/b hydrolase fold. This fold is shared by a diverse range of hydrolytic enzymes (Ollis et al., 1992).

Results and Discussion
Quality of the model The structure of CVL was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement using four derivatives, two of them with anomalous scattering, and has ° been refined at 1.6 A to an R-factor of 17.8% using ° 32395 reflections beyond 8 A resolution. The final model consists of 2316 protein atoms, 230 water molecules and one Ca2+. The restraints of the relevant stereochemical parameters applied in PROLSQ (CCP4, 1994) refinement, and their actual r.m.s. deviations in the final model, are summarized in Table 1. The Fo /Fc correlation coefficient is 0.96 for all reflections in the resolution range from 8.0 to ° 1.6 A. The overall coordinate error, estimated from ° a Luzzatti plot (Luzzatti, 1952), is 0.18 A. A f/c plot of the model is shown in Figure 2. Of all amino acids, 93% have allowed conformations (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968). Residues Ser87 (f = 55.5°/c = -129.7°) and Thr20 (f = 70.1°/ c = l74.8°) are located in general regions of the Ramachandran plot. Ser87 has the typical conformation for the nucleophile elbow (Derewenda & Sharp, 1993), and Thr20 is involved in the oxyanion

C. viscosum lipase has an a/b hydrolase fold with the b­a­b structural motif repeated five times. Two additional short antiparallel b-sheets are formed by residues 22-23, 27-28 and 214 to 216, 226 to 228. The central b-type hydrophobic core of the CVL is covered on one side by helices a1 and a11 , and on the other side by helices a2 , a3 , a7 and a10 . The other five a-helices form the substrate binding domain, which includes also two antiparallel b-sheets. The Ca2+ binding site, which is part of this domain, is ° approximately 15 A away from the catalytic triad

residues. The binding site is separated from the active center by the loop between b-strand 6 and helix a11 , which includes His285 of the catalytic triad. The other members of the catalytic triad are Ser87 and Asp263. Ser87 is located between b-strand 3 ° and helix a3 , approximately 18 A from the surface in the middle of the molecule. Asp263 is found in a loop region between a9 and a10 near the molecule surface. The catalytic center

The active site
The arrangement of the residues that form the active center in CVL is very similar to the active site of serine proteinases (Cygler et al., 1993). The catalytic triad residues, Ser87, His285 and Asp263 show a hydrogen bonding arrangement that is characteristic for lipases and serine proteinases (Kraut, 1977): the Ne2 (His) is bound to Og (Ser), while the Nd1 of the imidazolium group is hydrogen bonded to the Od1 of Asp. This pairing is thought to modify the nucleophilicity of a His-bound active residue (Derewenda, 1994). The catalytic serine is located in a type II' turn (Richardson, 1981) between strand b3 and the following helix a3 , similar to other lipases (Cygler et al., 1992). This turn is stabilized by two backbone hydrogen bonds, one between the carbonyl oxygen of Ser87 and the NH group of Gly90, with a distance ° of 3.01 A, the second between the NH group of ° Ser87 and the carbonyl oxygen of Ile110 with 2.97 A.

The region around the catalytic serine is dominated by non-polar residues. The side-chains of residues Leu17, Ala18, Thr20, Lys22, Phe23, Tyr29, Gln88, Phe146 and Leu149 on one side, and those of Phe142, Ala160, Leu161, Leu164, Leu167, Leu265 and Val266 on the other side of Ser87, contribute to the hydrophobicity of the substrate binding domain. The active site histidine, His285, is located in a 310-turn region following strand b6 . The backbone nitrogen of His285 is hydrogen bonded to the ° carbonyl oxygen of Asp263 at 2.68 A, and the ° carbonyl oxygen of His285 to Ne2 of His86 at 3.05 A. The side-chain conformation of His285 is stabilized ° by hydrogen bonds to Og of Ser87 at 2.7 A, and to ° Od1 of Asp263 at 2.78 A (Figure 6). In addition to the mentioned hydrogen bonds to the Nd1 of His285, the side-chain conformation of Asp263 is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from Od2 to ° the backbone nitrogen atoms of Leu265 at 2.91 A, ° , and by van der Waals' contacts to Val266 at 2.79 A ° the carbonyl oxygen of Val266 at 3.37 A, and to Nd1 ° of His285 at 3.49 A. Glu288 is located in the neighborhood of Asp263. The orientation of this residue is stabilized by a main-chain hydrogen bond from the backbone nitrogen to the carbonyl oxygen of Asn284. The side-chain atoms of Glu288, Oe1 and Oe2, are hydrogen bonded to the backbone nitrogen of Gly211 and the Ne2 atom of His86 and thus are participating in a hydrogen bonding network from Tyr29 via His86 to Glu288. The distances between ° the involved atoms are Tyr29-Oh . . . 2.73 A . . . Nd1e2 ° . . . Oe2-Glu288. This arrangeHis86-N . . . 3.13 A ment places Oe1 of Glu288 at the unusual distance ° of 2.58 A from the Od1 of Asp263, which is similar

to the one found in the Rhizomucor miehei lipase (RML) structure (Brady et al., 1990). Thus Glu288 can, at least in part, take over the functional role of Asp263 (and in the wild-type may enhance the function of Asp263). Mutagenesis experiments with PGL (Frenken et al., 1992) have shown that the mutant Asp263Ala has a residual activity of 25% compared to the wild-type. In those variants, Glu288 would function as the acidic group of the catalytic triad. Preliminary modeling shows that a

rotation about x2 of the side-chain angle would turn His285 into hydrogen bonding distance to Glu288 without need for any other change of the catalytic center conformation.

The oxyanion hole
From the enzymology of serine proteases, it is known that the negative charge of the tetrahedral intermediate must be stabilized by hydrogen bonds.

This oxyanion stabilization is visible in the inhibitor-bound lipase structures of Rhizomucor miehei (Brzozowski et al., 1991; PDB entry 5TGL) and Candida antarctica type B (Uppenberg et al., 1994; PDB entry 1TCA), which represent the open, active state of the enzymes. The binding site is also present in the closed conformation of Candida rugosa lipase structure (Grochulski et al., 1994). Superposition of CVL on these structures shows the backbone nitrogen atoms of Gln88 and Leu17 to be at positions equivalent to residues identified as forming the oxyanion hole in these other structures. The position of the oxyanion in the CVL structure is occupied by a water molecule. Leu17 and Thr20 occur in the epsilon conformation, which is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds to the

imidazolium ring of His15 and the guanidine group of Arg61 (Figure 7(a)).

The lid The catalytic triad in CVL is not exposed to the solvent. The active site is buried under a lid-like structure. Average main-chain temperature factors ° greater than 35 A2 can be found for the residues 128 to 136 and 148 to 155 in the loop regions at both ends of helix a5 . This indicates that a movement of helix a5 is necessary for the interfacial activation of this lipase, as was found in the case of other lipases (Derewenda et al., 1992).

et al., 1991), GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991), or BRAGI (Schomburg & Reichelt, 1988), shows a hydrophilic trough from one side of the molecule to the catalytic Ser87 (Figure 7(b)). The trough is filled with some water molecules, arranged like beads in a chain. The calcium binding site and cis -peptide bond Metal ions have been shown to play an important role in stabilizing proteins by binding at specific sites, and hence reducing the flexibility of the protein and its susceptibility to partial unfolding (Gregory et al., 1993). Previous biochemical investigations of CVL (Sugiura & Isobe, 1974) revealed an activation in the presence of calcium ions. The location of this calcium ion was indicated early in our refinement by a high electron density peak in difference Fourier maps. The detailed geometry and coordination sphere of Ca2+ is visible in Figure 8. All ° distances to calcium are about 2.4 A, which is in accord with distances observed in small molecules (Breese & O'Keeffe, 1992). The coordination geometry of this site is octahedral with contacts to four oxygen atoms from the protein and two water molecules. One of the four proteinogenic calcium coordination partners is the carbonyl oxygen of the cis-peptide bond (Figure 8) between Gln291 and Leu292. Several hydrogen bonds stabilize this cis-peptide bond in a hydrogen bonding network (Figure 9), which extends to the catalytic His285 of

the active site. Loss of the calcium ion with an accompanying loss of hydrogen bonds will therefore influence main and side-chain conformations in the region of the active His285, resulting in enzyme inactivation, as shown by biochemical investigations on PGL (Deveer, 1992). Comparison with the three-dimensional structure of the lipase from Pseudomonas glumae A comparison of the CVL structure with the PGL structure (PDB code 1TAH) shows the overall fold of both structures to be very similar with an r.m.s. ° deviation of 0.4 A for 258 of the 316 Ca atoms, as calculated with LSQKAB. This is not surprising, as PGL has the same sequence with the exception of the prospective proteolytic loss of three amino acids in CVL. However, major structural differences are visible in three regions, mainly in the substrate binding domain, and cause an overall r.m.s. ° deviation of 1.9 A for all Ca atoms (Figure 10(a) and (b)). Differences in the substrate binding domain start at the C-terminal end of helix a4 , which is shortened by a conformational change in the f angle (aR to gR ), (Richardson, 1981) of Lys128 and Thr129. The average r.m.s. difference in this loop region ° between the helices a4 and a5 is 1.2 A. The following helix a5 is shifted relative to PGL, with r.m.s.

711 completely different conformation in both structures, with a change of approximately 180° in c at Val150, but it still covers approximately the same ° area. The differences gradually decrease from 1.5 A ° at Thr156 at the beginning of helix a6 to 0.7 A at its end at Ala162, indicating a slightly shifted position also for helix a6 . Small conformational differences occur at both ends of this helix, indicating that, in CVL residues, 156 to 162 belong to helix a6 , compared with residues 157 to 165 in PGL. This structural rearrangement increases the ° solvent-accessible surface of CVL by 66 A2 compared to PGL. It leads to a hydrogen bonding pattern different from PGL in this region (Table 2). In particular, the rearrangement of the loop Val150 to Asn155 is correlated with the major structural differences observed in the region His15 to Asp28. In the PGL structure, the main-chain from His15 to Asp28 forms a long unstructured loop between the end of strand b1 and the start of helix a1 . In CVL, the main-chain conformation is changed starting from His15, with major conformational differences at Gly16 and Leu17, which are now in an orientation to form part of the oxyanion hole. Nevertheless, the ° amide nitrogen of Leu17 has shifted by only 0.7 A compared to PGL. The course of the main-chain deviates after Leu17 and a short antiparallel b-sheet is formed from residues 22 to 23 and 27 to 28. The two strands are connected by a type I' turn (Sibanda et al., 1989), where the second position is occupied by asparagine instead of the glycine residue usually found. The highest r.m.s. deviations, of more than ° 10 A, are observed for the residues Thr20 to Phe23, with the side-chain of Phe23 occupying approximately the position of the side-chain of Leu149 in PGL. In CVL, this region is stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds at His15. The x2 angle of this residue is changed by 90°, allowing strong hydrogen bonds to form between the Nd1 atom and the reoriented carbonyl oxygen of Gly16 and between the Ne2 and the backbone nitrogen of Leu49 (Figure 12). The position of the buried Arg61 is conserved, but in CVL the hydrogen bonds stabilizing the oxyanion loop are formed with the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Leu17 and Gly51, in contrast to PGL, where these bonds are formed with Gly16 and Phe52. This shift in the hydrogen bonds is reflected by major conformational changes in the third region as well as in the Leu49 to Ser54 loop ° with r.m.s. deviations of more than 4 A at Gly51. In conclusion, the r.m.s. deviation in Ca positions of residues 15 to 28, 49 to 54, 128 to 158, 217 to 219 ° and 223 to 225 is 4.1 A. A reason for these structural changes may be the different crystallization conditions of the two lipases. PGL was crystallized at pH 9 (Cleasby et al., 1992), whereas CVL was crystallized at pH 6.4 (Lang et al., 1994). Biochemical investigations (Prazeres et al., 1992; Deveer, 1992) have shown a bell-shaped pH activity profile between pH 5.5 and 9 with an optimum at pH 7.0 to 7.5 for the enzymes. PGL probably was crystallized in an inactive state characterized by a

In addition, the conformation of residues Thr148 and Leu149 at the C-terminal end of this helix is changed in f (aR to gR ). The highest ° deviation (up to 7 A) occurs at Ser151 in the loop region between helix a5 and a6 . This loop is in a

refolding without loss of the calcium ion. CVL, however, might be in its active state with a well-formed oxyanion hole. The active site residues are not exposed to the solvent in both structures, but in the CVL structure the secondary structure

elements that cover the entrance to the active site are already gradually starting to move away from the active center. Comparison with enzymes of similar structure CVL, as well as other lipases, is a member of the a/b-hydrolase-fold family (Ollis et al., 1992). The structure of CVL contains a subset of this fold, such that b1 of CVL is equivalent to b3 of this fold. Differences are the absence of the first two b-strands of the central sheet, and the addition of an antiparallel b-strand and two short antiparallel b-sheets. Although the sequence identity between the different members of the family is low, many parts of CVL can be superimposed on equivalent residues in other lipases and a/b hydrolase enzymes (Table 3A). In each case, the semi-automatic structural alignment option of O (Jones et al., ° 1991) was used with a cutoff value of 2.7 A and a minimum fragment length of four residues. The resulting superpositions are best for the central hydrophobic b-sheet and for the helices a1 , a2 , a3 and a11 . The structural homology may be extended on the basis of a comparison of lipase sequences classified and aligned by Gilbert (1993) and Jaeger et al. (1994). Bacterial lipases from Pseudomonas subgroup I (Pseudomonas cepacia), and subgroup II (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), as well as from the genus Staphylococcus, show a significant residue conservation in the region of the oxyanion hole, after b-strand 1, and for the catalytic triad residues (Table 3B). By modeling the three-dimensional structure of the lipase from P. aeruginosa (belonging to subgroup II) on the basis of the coordinates of PGL, it was proposed (Jaeger et al., 1993) that the overall folding seems to be very similar within this group.

Conclusions
° The 1.6 A structure of CVL gives more detailed conformational information on the closed form of a bacterial lipase from the Pseudomonas family ° (subgroup I) than the 3.0 A structure of PGL. In spite of 100% sequence identity, the CVL shows considerable structural differences compared to the PGL. Both structures are representatives of the closed conformation of lipases, but the CVL differs from the PGL by the presence of an additional short antiparallel b-sheet, a shortening of helices a4 , a5 and a6 by two residues, a shortening of the second antiparallel b-sheet by a probable proteolytic digestion, by a lengthening of strand b6 of the central b-sheet by five residues, by the existence of a cis-peptide bond, by the presence of an intact oxyanion hole, and by a movement of helix a5 ° for 3 A to the outside.

Both structures together provide information about the internal structural rearrangement of lipases upon activation. The formation of the oxyanion hole has already taken place. The active site is not solvent-accessible but is covered by the lid. This lid already starts a movement away from the active site that is a requirement for the enzymatic mechanism of lipases at the hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface. These changes probably represent an intermediate stage of the conformational transition from the inactive conformation with a closed lid to the active conformation with an opened lid, like in the structures of Candida rugosa lipase (Grochulski et al., 1993, 1994). X-ray investigations of ligand-bound CVL will completely illuminate the structural rearrangement of the bacterial lipase, such as the lid movement for its enzymatic mechanism at the interface.

Crystal Structure of a Bacterial Lipase

Materials and Methods
Crystallization and data collection The lipase from Chromobacterium viscosum ATCC 6918 has been crystallized by vapor diffusion in sitting drops using polyethylene glycol and methyl-pentane-diol as precipitants in the presence of b-octyl-glycopyranoside (Lang et al., 1994). The protein concentration was 15 mg/ml buffered with 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The ° ° space group is P21 21 2 with a = 41.1 A, b = 156.8 A and ° c = 43.6 A with one monomer per asymmetric unit. Native ° (2.2 A) and derivative data were collected on a Rigaku ° RU-200 rotating Cu-anode X-ray generator (l = 1.5418 A) equipped with a Siemens X-1000 area detector. Data collection was monitored by the program FRAMBO (SAXII Area Detector Software Release Notes for Version 1.21, Specimens Analytical X-ray Instruments, Inc., 1990), and data reduction was carried out with XENGEN ° (Howard et al., 1987). Native data to 1.6 A were collected from a single crystal on the wiggler beamline no. 6 at the ° DORIS storage ring, DESY, Hamburg (l = 1.0 A), with a MAR Research imaging plate scanner. The synchrotron data were processed using the MOSFLM package (CCP4, 1994). Scaling and merging of the profile-fitted integrated intensities from all data were performed using the CCP4 programs (1979, 1994) ROTAVATA and AGROVATA. For all other calculations the CCP4 program suite was used. Heavy-atom derivatives Approximately three dozen heavy-metal reagents were screened by soaking crystals in mother liquor containing the heavy atom, and four proved to be good candidates for isomorphous derivatives (Table 4). For the iodine derivative, short washing of the soaked crystals in the iodine-free crystallization solution was successful in prolonging the crystal lifetime in the X-ray exposure. Derivative data were screened and monitored by precession photography. If the diffraction pattern of a derivative showed significant intensity changes, data for approximately 45° in f (400 frames) were collected and processed, and the isomorphous difference between parent and derivative data sets was computed. A mean fractional isomorphous difference in the range of 0.10 to 0.25 and unchanged cell dimensions were considered acceptable minimum conditions for a full data collection. The metal-binding sites were identified from difference ° Patterson maps, calculated with data in the 6.0 to 20.0 A resolution range using HASSP (CCP4, 1979). These maps revealed, at first, one binding site per molecule for platinum, and two sites for mercury, iodine and palladium. The relative positions of all derivative sites were established from cross-phased difference Fourier maps using the platinum site for initial phase calculation with MLPHARE. The positional parameters of the heavy atoms were refined initially with VECREF to the respective resolution. Prior to the phase calculation to ° 3.0 A resolution, occupancies including anomalous ones and derivative scale and temperature factors were refined with MLPHARE. The final figure of merit was 0.72 for 4462 acentric and 0.84 for 976 centric reflections. The initial Fourier map, calculated with the best MIR phases at 3.0, revealed a few secondary structure elements, but the map was not clear enough to begin an unambiguous model building. The map was further improved by solvent flattening using the reciprocal space averaging program of Leslie (1987). The solvent flattening procedure was started at 30% (v/v) solvent content to

avoid the danger of flattening protein portions of the map. Solvent content was gradually increased to 36% in steps of 1%. The original MIR phases were used in the first cycle. In subsequent cycles the calculated phases from each flattening cycle (about six cycles per solvent content needed for convergence) were combined with those from the previous cycle. The new envelope was employed in flattening the original MIR map. To get better connectivities and structural details of the protein the electron density map was further improved by histogram matching combined with solvent flattening using SQUASH. For this calculation the solvent content was kept at 36% (v/v), and for the histogram matching step the standard histogram was used (Zhang & Main, 1990). The interpretation of the electron density map was based on skeletonized electron density calculated by the program BONES (Greer, 1974). Extensive positional, and/or simulated-annealing (slowcool protocol) refinements with X-PLOR (Brunger, 1991a,b, 1992) were ¨ carried out, interspersed with frequent model building with FRODO (Jones, 1978) or O (Jones et al., 1991), using improved electron density maps calculated by combination of calculated partial model and MIR phases. Phase combination was done by the program SIGMAA. The initial improved electron density map showed several well-defined b-strand and a-helix regions. As the three-dimensional structure of the common core of lipases is well known, model building was started at the nucleophilic serine residue in the active site, which is located in a sharp turn. Aided by the amino acid sequence more than 30% of all amino acids could be built in the N and C-terminal directions from this starting point. Together with a number of partially constructed secondary elements that were visible and built in as polyalanine chains refinement was started using X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987), which decreased the R-factor from ¨ ° 39.2% to 30.3% for 10.0 to 3.0 A data. Each refinement cycle consisted of an energy minimization step followed by simulated annealing at every fourth round, using the

force field parameters of Engh & Huber (1991). Further iterations of refinement, including additionally group B-factor refinement, model building and stepwise extension of the resolution reduced the R-factor to 25.9% ° for 8.0 to 2.5 A data. At this stage, two of the last three remaining chain fragments could be connected by additional residues. The B-factor refinement was changed from group to individual atom refinement, followed by separate averaging over main-chain and side-chain atoms of each amino acid. At this stage, a Ca2+ and the first water ° molecules were included. At 2.2 A resolution, the high resolution synchrotron native data set was used for further refinement. The synchrotron data set has a mean fractional isomorphous difference of 0.05 to the CuKa ° native data set. At 1.6 A the cis-peptide was found and the R-factor dropped to 19.2%. The next step was to switch to restrained least-squares refinement (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980). A total of 150 cycles of SFALL, PROTIN, PROLSQ and BAVERAGE were carried out. The target standard deviations, which determined the weights of the various stereochemical restraints, were set as shown in Table 1.
