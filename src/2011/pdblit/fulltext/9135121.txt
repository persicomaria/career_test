Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyses the oxidative deamination of glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate with concomitant reduction of NAD(P), and has been shown to be widely distributed in nature across species ranging from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles. Extensive characterisation of this enzyme isolated from hyperthermophilic organisms has led to its adoption as a model system for analysing the determinants of thermal stability. The crystal structure of the extremely thermostable glutamate Ê dehydrogenase from Thermococcus litoralis has been determined at 2.5 A resolution, and has been compared to that from the hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus. The two enzymes are 87 % identical in sequence, yet differ 16-fold in their half-lives at 104  C. This is the ®rst reported comparative analysis of the structures of a multisubunit enzyme from two closely related yet distinct hyperthermophilies. The less stable T. litoralis enzyme has a decreased number of ion pair interactions; modi®ed patterns of hydrogen bonding resulting from isosteric sequence changes; substitutions that decrease packing ef®ciency; and substitutions which give rise to subtle but distinct shifts in both main-chain and side-chain elements of the structure. This analysis provides a rational basis to test ideas on the factors that confer thermal stability in proteins through a combination of mutagenesis, calorimetry, and structural studies.

Introduction
The ability of enzymes from hyperthermophiles to operate for long periods at temperatures in excess of 100  C has prompted much research into the molecular mechanisms that give rise to such remarkable properties (Flam, 1994). Analysis of the structure of hyperthermophilic proteins has highlighted a range of differences between these enzymes and their mesophilic counterparts, including increased numbers of ion pairs, reduction in the size of loops and in the number of cavities,

reduced ratio of surface area to volume, introduction of additional proline residues, increased hydrophobic interaction at subunit interfaces, increase in the extent of secondary structure formation and truncated N and C termini (Elcock, 1998; Vogt et al., 1997; Tanner et al., 1996; Starich et al., 1996; Yip et al., 1995; Chan et al., 1995; È Korndorfer et al., 1995; Russell et al., 1994). Some of these hypotheses have been tested by mutagenesis and recent work has indicated that increments of stability may be achieved in proteins from mesophiles by a variety of mechanisms such as the inclusion of ``rigidifying'' mutations to ¯exible regions of secondary structure and the introduction of charged-charged interactions (Van Den Burg et al., 1998; Bogin et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1995).

1122 The changes in stabilisation energy required to adapt an enzyme to high temperature operation are thought to be only of the order of a few hydrogen bonds, van der Waals contacts or stabilising ion pairs (Jaenicke, 1996). That no generally accepted unifying theory on the origins of stability has yet emerged may well be due to the different ways in which nature can produce such subtle effects. The fact that this energy difference is so small highlights the dif®culties associated with understanding the molecular basis of this phenomena, even where high resolution crystal structures are available. Pyrococcus furiosus (Pf) and Thermococcus litoralis (Tl) are hyperthermophilic organisms whose optimal growth temperatures are 100  C (Fiala & Stetter, 1986) and 88  C (Neuner et al., 1990), respectively. The glutamate dehydrogenases (GluDH, EC 1.4.1.2-4) from these organisms are closely related sharing 87 % sequence identity with only a single residue insertion between the two sequences. Despite this similarity, the Pf enzyme has a half life of 4.6 hours at 104  C compared with 0.3 hour for the Tl enzyme with their melting temperatures being 114.5  C and 109  C, respectively (Vetriani et al., 1998). Following the determination of the structure of the Pf GluDH (Yip et al., 1995), we have sought to crystallise and examine the structure of the corresponding Tl enzyme. Here we report the structure determination of Tl GluDH at Ê 2.5 A, and its comparison to the Pf GluDH structure as a contribution towards a better understanding of factors controlling stability.

dues 3-182 and 395-419) is responsible for directing the assembly of the subunits into a hexamer with 32 symmetry to give a molecule of cylindrical Ê appearance and approximate dimensions 100 A Ê height and 80 A diameter. With the exception of the C-terminal helix a14, which folds back onto domain I, the remaining residues (183-394) comprise domain II, the dinucleotide binding domain. Across the wide variety of structures of GluDH that have been solved, differences of up to 18  in the relative orientation of the two domains have been observed. Even comparing different subunits within the asymmetric unit of speci®c crystal forms, differences of up to 11.9  in domain opening have been seen (Abeysinghe, 1993). For the three subunits in the asymmetric unit of the crystals of Pf GluDH, the two domains of the A and C subunits have domain openings, relative to the B subunit, of 0.9 and À0.6  , respectively. In the Tl GluDH crystals, a hexamer is present in the asymmetric unit and the relative domain openings of the six subunits, with respect to the B subunit of the Pf enzyme, vary between 0.5 and À3.7  . Comparison of Tl and Pf GluDHs Similarities in the overall fold and in the active site Overall, the fold of Tl GluDH is almost identical with that of the more stable Pf enzyme and 205 and 211 a-carbon atoms of domains I and II can be Ê superimposed with an rmsd of 0.59 and 0.38 A, respectively. This close relationship in structure permits a detailed comparison of their threedimensional structure to be made. The only region of signi®cant structural difference is close to residue 209 in the Pf structure which lies in the loop between a6 and bg. The deletion of one residue of the Tl enzyme induces very localised changes in the structure at this position. Elsewhere, the percentage of residues in regular secondary structure for both enzymes is very similar (Table 1). The Tl enzyme appears to have a lower number of hydrogen bonds per residue than the more stable Pf enzyme, however this may just be a re¯ection of the lower resolution of the Tl enzyme structure. The B-factors for the Tl structure are, in general, higher than those seen in Pf GluDH. However, a similar distribution of the B-factors for the two domains is seen between the two enzymes with the average B-factors for the hexamer of the Tl and Ê Pf GluDH structures in domain I (43 and 32 A2, respectively) being lower than those in domain II Ê (58 and 45 A2, respectively). Although the differences in B-factors between the two enzymes are signi®cant and might be anticipated on account of their differences in thermal stability, they may just re¯ect the different crystal packing and the lower resolution of the Tl structure. Therefore, they cannot be attributed solely to differences in the thermal stability of the enzymes. The assembly of the subunits into a hexamer in Tl GluDH is very similar to that seen in the Pf

Results
Throughout this paper the Pf GluDH numbering is used when identifying equivalent residues in the Tl enzyme. In each case, when referring to positions of sequence difference between the two enzymes a bold italic style is used and the residue in Pf GluDH is identi®ed ®rst (e.g. I107V). Elsewhere, the notation D167T, for example, in normal type, is used to describe the creation of a mutant enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis with the residue in the wild-type enzyme ®rst. Molecular structure The molecular structure of Tl GluDH is very similar to that seen in all the other GluDHs whose structures have been elucidated, which include those from Clostridium symbiosum (Cs) (Baker et al., 1992), Escherichia coli (Abeysinghe, 1993), Thermotoga maritima (Knapp et al., 1997) and Pyrococcus furiosus (Yip et al., 1995), (Figure 1). Tl GluDH is most closely related in sequence, structure and stability to the latter and a structure based sequence alignment of the Tl GluDH against the more stable Pf enzyme, together with secondary structure assignments, is shown in Figure 2. Each subunit of the Tl enzyme is constructed from two domains, separated by a deep cleft. Domain I (resi-

The active site of GluDH has been identi®ed from analysis of the binary complexes of Cs GluDH with NAD and glutamate (Baker et al., 1992; Stillman et al., 1993). In this enzyme 21 resiÊ dues have at least one atom lying within 6 A of any atom of the glutamate substrate. All of these residues are identical in both the Tl and Pf enzymes, suggesting that the differential stability of these two GluDHs does not impose severe restrictions on the residues at the active site.

Effect of sequence changes between the two enzymes In addition to the deletion, there are 52 other sequence differences between the Pf and Tl GluDHs (Figure 2). The differences in structure at these positions have been analysed in order to give further insights into the factors controlling stability.

This is the total for the hexamer.

1125 (Figure 3(d)) do not appear to introduce any signi®cant movements of either main-chain or side-chain between the Tl and Pf enzymes, despite the addition of an extra methyl group at each position in the Pf enzyme. The other two residues are adjacent in the two structures (Q337I and H394N) and in the Tl GluDH adopt a different position from that seen in the Pf enzyme. Changes resulting in modifications to the water structure At a number of positions substitutions occur which involve a reorganisation of the local water structure. For example, residue 235 is phenylalanine in Pf GluDH, and is replaced by tyrosine in the Tl enzyme. Although at ®rst glance this change might be expected to ®ll a cavity present in the Pf enzyme, in fact the extra hydroxyl group of the tyrosine side-chain in the Tl structure merely replaces an enzyme bound water molecule in the Pf structure, resulting in no signi®cant overall change in packing. Similarly the sequence change A388H occurs in a surface depression in the Pf enzyme, which is occupied by enzyme bound water molecules. In the Tl enzyme the larger histidyl side-chain displaces these water molecules with no consequent overall change in packing. Changes inducing main-chain or sidechain movements The remaining 15 sequence differences (Figure 2) appear to result in subtle but distinct differences in the position and orientation of the main-chain and/or side-chain of neighbouring residues, with Ê movements of the order of 0.5 A. Although the resolution of the Tl structure is somewhat limited, the structural differences observed between this enzyme and the Pf GluDH are fully consistent with the observed sequence differences. For example, the replacement of isoleucine by valine at position 172 would, in the absence of other structural changes, lead to the production of a cavity adjacent to the main-chain between residues 134 and 137 in the Tl enzyme. Comparison of the two structures clearly reveals that in response to this substitution both main-chain and side-chain elements subtly rearrange so as to maximise the packing (Figure 4(a)). There are also a number of examples where a larger side-chain is present in the Tl structure and corresponding movements of the mainchain are necessary to accommodate the extra atoms (T167D (Figure 4(b)), A169S, A295S). For two of the substitutions complementary movements of adjacent side-chains occur. For example, Asp234 forms an ion pair with Arg192 in the Pf structure. This interaction is retained in the Tl enzyme, despite the sequence change D234E, by a complementary movement of the side-chain of Arg192 (Figure 4(c)). For the change T40S, the loss of the methyl group of the threonine in Pf is

Changes between partially disordered residues Five of the sequence differences between the two enzymes involve residues which are partially disordered in both structures (de®ned as having sideÊ chain B factors >25 A2 above the average for the protein) and a further six of the sequence differences involve residues that are partially disordered in the Pf enzyme alone. Of these 11 residues, nine lie on the surface of the enzyme (de®ned as >30 % of the residue accessible to solvent). That these residues are disordered in both structures, or in just the structure of the more stable enzyme, leads us to suggest that they play little role in their differential thermal stability. Complementary changes Fifteen of the sequence differences occur not as isolated substitutions but rather are clustered in space (Y6F and H60Y; G185A and I366V; I187M and E188D; I198V, L227M and V317L; V204A and Y382W; Y362D and R372K; L412K and V417I). The overall result of these changes maintains the packing within the structure and leads to no signi®cant shifts in either neighbouring main-chain or side-chain elements. For example, Tyr6 and His60 pack against each other in the Pf GluDH structure and these are replaced by Phe6 and Tyr60, respectively in the Tl enzyme. Similarly, Ile198, Leu227 and Val317 pack in a local group in Pf GluDH, and these residues are replaced by Val198, Met227 and Leu318 in the Tl enzyme, to maintain the local packing (Figure 3(a)). Again, the extra space formed by the sequence change V204A in the Tl structure is ®lled by the side-chain of Y382W (Figure 3(b)). Isosteric changes In three cases an isosteric change occurs, maintaining the same local packing in both structures (D110N, V322T, V369T). In two of these cases a different pattern of hydrogen bonding is observed. Thus, a movement of the side-chain carboxyl of Glu315 together with the sequence change V322T results in a hydrogen bond between these two residues in the Tl GluDH structure (Figure 3(c)). Similarly, in the Tl enzyme, the side-chain hydroxyl of V369T is within hydrogen bonding distance of the main-chain carbonyl of Thr364. The isosteric substitution D110N, maintains the same hydrogen bonding pattern at this position in the structure of the two enzymes with, in each case, a hydrogen bond formed between the side-chain residue OD1 and the main-chain amide nitrogen of K112. Packing changes Six of the changes involve the creation of ®ve regions in buried parts of the Tl structure in which the packing appears less ef®cient. The single sequence changes I107V, I127V, I180V and I387T

both the number of ion pairs and the number of multi-centre ion pair networks compared to those observed in the equivalent mesophilic enzymes (Yip et al., 1995). Such ion pair networks have also been observed in other hyperthermophilic proteins (Lim et al., 1997; Russell et al., 1997; DeDecker et al.,

1996; Hennig et al., 1995) and have been suggested to enhance stability through the shared entropic costs upon ion pair formation (Nakamura, 1996). The most extensive ion pair network formed in the Pf enzyme involves the interaction of 18 residues located at the interface between four different subunits. Each of these residues is completely conserved in Tl GluDH, although two of the residues lying at the edge of the cluster (Arg117 and its 2fold related partner) are more disordered in the Tl enzyme. Interestingly, a comparison of the ion pair interactions of Thermotoga maritima GluDH, an enzyme whose melting temperature (93  C) is signi®cantly less than that of either Pf or Tl GluDH,

shows that in this enzyme the most extensive ion pair network is one of only seven residues (Knapp et al., 1997), suggesting that the size of the ion pair clusters may be important in determining stability. The second largest ion pair network in the Pf enzyme involves six residues and is centred on Glu138, which makes three ion pair interactions to the side-chains of Arg35, Arg165 and Lys166 (Figure 5). Within the Tl structure, the E138T sequence change disrupts this ion pair network, with no other sequence substitutions restoring the lost ion pair interactions, as predicted by an earlier homology based modelling study (Yip et al., 1998). Thus the six residue cluster in Pf GluDH is

replaced by one of only three residues in the Tl enzyme. Close examination of the two structures in this region also reveals subtle shifts in the relative positions of segments of main-chain including residues 164-168 as well as around position 138 itself (Figure 5). In addition, the single ion pair interaction between His419 and Glu25 in Pf GluDH is lost in the Tl enzyme as a consequence of the sequence change H419K combined with an alternative conformation for the side-chain of Glu25.

Discussion
The comparison of the structure of Tl GluDH with that of the more stable Pf enzyme has highlighted a number of structural differences consistent with the current ideas on the mechanisms for thermal stability. Such analyses, however, are fraught with dif®culties and we must be careful not to assume that all the sequence differences between Tl and Pf GluDHs are destabilising. Indeed, it is highly likely that some of the sequence changes between the two enzymes will stabilise the Tl structure, and the observed difference in stability is due to the balance of stabilising and destabilising interactions. For example, two of the isosteric changes, V322T and V369T introduce additional hydrogen bonds into the Tl structure compared to the situation seen in the Pf enzyme and the in¯uence of these might well be stabilising. Of the other structural differences seen between the Pf and Tl enzymes, the observation that the latter contains regions in which the packing appears less ef®cient is consistent with the idea that packing defects are destabilising (Kellis et al., 1989; Eriksson et al., 1992, 1993). Moreover, it is interesting to note that the sequence changes in three of these involve the exchange of isoleucine for valine with one occuring in a cluster of ®ve isoleucine residues in the Pf enzyme. Such clusters of isoleucine residues have also been noted in the structure

of P. furiosus citrate synthase (Russell et al., 1997). However, their role in conferring stability is as yet unknown. During the catalytic cycle of enzymes belonging to the amino acid dehydrogenase superfamily, a change in the relative orientation of the enzyme's two domains occurs which is responsible for positioning the partners involved in hydride transfer into an appropriate orientation for catalysis (Stillman et al., 1993). This motion involves a large scale domain closure which is controlled by conformational changes at four hinge points in the structure (residues 181-187; 346-350; 362-365; and 392393 inclusive). Interestingly, 12 (178, 180, 183, 184, 185, 187, 188, 362, 366, 387, 388, 394) of the 52 sequence differences between these two enzymes occur at, or near, the hinge regions (Baker et al., 1997). However, whether these sequence differences have any effect on the relative ¯exibility of the two domains, contributing to the ease with which this structural change is brought about, remains to be determined. One of the major debates in the ®eld of stability is the degree to which ion pairs can play a role in stabilising protein structures at high temperatures, where the hydrophobic interaction is enthalpydriven rather than entropy-driven at mesophilic temperatures (Baldwin, 1986; Privalov & Gill, 1998; Perutz & Raidt, 1975). The comparison of the structures of the Pf and Tl GluDHs clearly reveals an overall decrease in the extent of the ion pair network formation (Table 2). In particular, the second largest ion pair network of six residues in Pf GluDH is not present in the Tl structure, due to the critical replacement of the central glutamate residue by threonine (E138T) (Figure 5). The question that arises, therefore, is whether this substitution is destabilising. In order to test this proposal a single mutation, T138E, was introduced into Tl GluDH with the aim of enhancing its stability. However, biochemical studies have established that this mutant enzyme is less stable, having a

1129 it is possible that in the double mutant the second mutation (D167T) works in conjunction with the ®rst (T138E) to allow all the side-chains in the six residue ion pair network to be optimally aligned. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that unfavourable electrostatic contacts in the region of residue 138 arise when a glutamate is introduced at this position in the Tl enzyme, given that additional aspartic acid residue is present at position 167, even though the carboxyl group of Ê the latter lies some 10 A from the centre of the ion pair network. In support of this we note that at high salt concentrations (1 M KCl), the D167T mutation stabilises the Tl enzyme 2.5-fold relative to the wild-type (D.L.M., B. Lee & F.T.R., unpublished), suggesting that unfavourable electrostatic interactions may be shielded in high ionic strength solutions. The related thermostable GluDH isolated from Pyrococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 also shows 90 % sequence identity to Pf GluDH and has a stability intermediate between the Pf and Tl enzyme but more closely related to that of the Tl GluDH. Examination of the sequence of the KOD1 GluDH shows that all the residues in the six residue ion pair network in Pf GluDH are conserved with the exception of the critical glutamate E138 which, as in the Tl enzyme, is replaced by threonine. In contrast to Tl GluDH, the T138E mutant of the KOD1 enzyme results in an increase in half-life at 100  C from two hours for the wild-type recombinant enzyme to three hours in the mutant enzyme (Rahman et al., 1998). Analysis of the sequence of the KOD1 GluDH reveals that the residue at position 167 is glycine, distinct from that observed in Pf and Tl GluDHs. The loss of bulk at this position compared to the latter two enzymes may well be compensated by a further sequence change which introduces methionine at position 163 in place of serine in both of the other GluDHs (see Figure 5 for the relative position of these residues). Thus, the context of position 138 is again different in the P. kodakaraensis GluDH, potentially explaining the different behaviour of the single mutant T138E introduced into both KOD1 and Tl GluDHs. The detailed understanding of the molecular basis of thermal stability of proteins has yet to emerge. Whilst a number of studies are suggesting a role for rigidifying mutations in controlling stability such analyses are not yet widely available and the view that multiple mechanisms can control stability still prevails. The detailed comparison of the two hyperthermophilic enzymes presented here is certainly suggestive of a role for ion pairs in control of stability. However, we also observe subtle changes in the context of speci®c residues between the two enzymes that arise from sequence differences. Given the marginal differences in stability between Pf and Tl GluDH the effect of these is very hard to predict. The comparison of two closely related structures however, has allowed us to focus our attention on distinct types of sequence changes which we can now follow up rationally in

melting temperature of 103.5  C and a half life at 104  C of <0.01 hour, compared to values of 109.0  C and 0.3 hour for the wild-type enzyme, respectively (Vetriani et al., 1998). This result at ®rst sight appears to undermine the idea that ion pairs play a role in conferring stability. However, as we have already noted, the local environment around position 138 in Tl GluDH is modi®ed with respect to the Pf enzyme which arises from the differences in the side-chains at this and at neighbouring positions. These result in subtle positional shifts in the main-chain of the string of basic residues Arg164, Arg165, and Lys166, as well as in the main-chain of Thr138, each of which participate in the six residue ion pair network in Pf GluDH (Figure 5). In addition, other nearby sequence substitutions modify the context of the glutamate at position 138 in the T138E mutant of Tl GluDH, compared to the Pf enzyme. For example, the substitution T167D must necessarily modify the electrostatic potential at position 138 in the Tl enzyme. One possible consequence of the subtle position shifts is that the residues in the Tl GluDH may not necessarily be in the correct orientation to reproduce the ion pair cluster seen in the Pf enzyme and hence could explain why the single mutation T138E might not confer additional stabilisation. The analysis of a double mutant of Tl GluDH (T138E, D167T) shows that it has a substantially increased thermal stability compared to the wildtype Tl enzyme (melting temperature of the mutant is 111.5  C and a half life at 104  C of 1.1 hour (Vetriani et al., 1998)) whereas the control mutation, D167T, leads to a slight reduction in thermal stability, all measured at 0.5 M KCl. Thus,

1130 a programme of site-directed mutagenesis. Whatever the outcome of that programme it is clear that stability data will need to be carefully correlated with the structural properties of the mutants before any unifying theme can be presented. In the long term, such detailed comparisons may test our ability to predict and calculate the properties of proteins and force us to re-examine strategies for molecular modelling and prediction of the effects of mutational changes.

Materials and Methods
Crystallisation Tl GluDH was prepared as previously described (Ma et al., 1994) and stored at a concentration of 35-40 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 2 mM DTT and 10 % (v/v) glycerol. For crystallisation, the protein solution was dialysed against a 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) to give a protein concentration of approximately 35 mg/ml. Crystals were grown using the hanging drop method of vapour diffusion by mixing 4 ml drops of the protein solution with equal portions of a precipitant solution made up of 0.1 M Hepes buffer (pH 8) containing 1.7-1.8 M ammonium sulphate and 1.5 % (w/v) PEG 8000. Crystals grew over a period of several months to reach a maximum dimension of 1.1 mm. These crystals were extremely sensitive to any changes in the mother liquor and hence could not be stabilised. Therefore, for crystallographic analysis they were mounted directly from the drop. The crystals belong to space group C2 with a hexamer in the asymmetric unit and have lattice constants Ê Ê Ê a  141.9 A, b  197.5 A and c  125.7 A with b  113.6  , and are distinct from those previously reported (Sedelnikova et al., 1996). Data were collected at the CLRCC Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source on station PX 9.5 using X-rays Ê with a wavelength of 0.92 A, on crystals of the native Ê Ê enzyme to 2.5 A and a mercury derivative, to 2.8 A. The derivative was prepared by brushing solid grains of dimercuriacetate (DMA) onto a native crystal in a capillary tube and leaving overnight. In each case the data were collected using the rotation method with a 1.5  oscillation range. The data were processed with the MOSFLM package (Leslie, 1992) and scaled and merged with CCP4 software (CCP4, 1994) (Table 3). A model of Pf GluDH (Yip et al., 1995) was used as a basis for a molecular replacement solution for the structure, but the initial map generated after the model was re®ned with the program TNT (Tronrud et al., 1987) was not of suf®cient quality to con®dently assign residues in regions of structural differences between the Pf and Tl enzymes. Therefore, in an attempt to provide a better initial phase set, the positions of the heavy atom sites in the DMA derivatives were obtained by difference Fourier methods using the phases provided by the molecular replacement solution. The heavy atom parameters were re®ned with the program MLPHARE (Otwinowski, 1991), which resulted in a phase set with an overall Ê mean ®gure of merit of 0.35 to 2.8 A resolution. Using a map derived from these phases, molecular masks were generated using MAMA (Kleywegt & Jones, 1993) and 200 cycles of solvent ¯attening and 6-fold molecular averaging were performed with the program DM (CCP4, 1994; Cowtan, 1994). The model was rebuilt from DM

averaged phases and further re®ned using the re®nement package TNT. Subsequent rebuilding was conducted by the examination of electron density maps based on coef®cients (2 mjFoj À DjFcj) with combined isomorphous and calculated phases. The ®nal model had a total of 416 residues built for each monomer, there being no electron density for the ®rst two residues. The ®nal R-factor for the model which comprises 19,542 nonhydrogen atoms with no added solvent is 0.192 for all Ê Ê data between 10 and 2.5 A with an rmsd of 0.013 A for bond lengths and 1.53  for bond angles (R  Æj(jFobsj À jFcalcj)j/Æ(jFobsj, where jFobsj and jFcalcj are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively). The corresponding free R-factor of 0.308 is somewhat higher, although the clear lack of bias in the re®ned electron density maps does not suggest that the structure is incorrect. The average B-factor for Ê Ê the hexamer is 46 A2 for main-chain atoms (50 A2 for side-chain atoms).
