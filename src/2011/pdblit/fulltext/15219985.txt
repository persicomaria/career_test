Abstract CYP119 from Sulfolobus solfataricus is the Wrst well-characterized thermophilic cytochrome P450 enzyme. The endogenous substrate for this enzyme is not known but it hydroxylates lauric acid in a reaction supported by surrogate mesophilic electron donors. However, reconstitution of a high-temperature catalytic system requires identiWcation of the normal thermophilic electron donor partners of CYP119. Here, we describe cloning, expression in Escherichia coli, and characterization of the requisite electron donor partners from S. solfataricus. One is a thermostable ferredoxin and the second a 2-oxoacid-ferredoxin oxidoreductase that utilizes pyruvic acid rather than NAD(P)H as the source of reducing equivalents. CYP119 is the only cytochrome P450 to date known to obtain electrons from a non-NAD(P)H-dependent protein. The two thermophilic partners have been used to reconstitute a catalytic system that hydroxylates lauric acid at 70 °C, and the optimal conditions for this system have been deWned. This Wrst high-temperature in vitro catalytic system represents an important step in the development of industrially relevant catalysts.  2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes utilize molecular oxygen to generate a reactive species that is capable of promoting reactions as diYcult as the regio- and stereospeciWc insertion of an oxygen atom into a hydrocarbon C­H bond to give a chiral alcohol [1]. The activated oxidizing species is believed to be a ferryl [formally (Fe(V)=O)] complex in which the oxygen is bound to the iron of the prosthetic heme group of the enzyme [1,2]. Formation of the ferryl species from molecular oxygen requires two reducing equivalents, which formally bring molecular oxygen to the level of hydrogen peroxide [3]. The two

required electrons are normally provided by either NADH or NADPH through the action of protein partners that uncouple the pyridine nucleotide electrons and deliver them to the P450 heme group one at a time. Three classes of electron donor systems have so far been shown to be involved in supplying electrons to P450 enzymes. One class, composed of a Xavoprotein and an iron­sulfur protein, is exempliWed by adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, or putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase [4,5]. The second class is represented by NADPH­cytochrome P450 reductase, a protein that contains two Xavin prosthetic groups [6,8]. The third class of proteins resembles cytochrome P450 reductase but is distinct from it in that the Xavoprotein is part of the same polypeptide as the P450 heme domain. The Wrst member of this third class was CYP102 (P450BM-3) [9],

but at least one additional member has been found [7]. Recent studies have found a diVerent fusion construct in which the P450 heme domain is fused to a ferredoxin domain, which in turn is reduced by a separate ferredoxin reductase [10], and a protein with a Xavoprotein and iron­sulfur ferredoxin fused to the heme domain [11]. Despite these variations, these systems are uniWed by the fact that they all utilize pyridine nucleotides as the ultimate source of the reducing equivalents. Two thermophilic cytochrome P450 enzymes have been characterized [12­19]. CYP119 from Sulfolobus sulfotaricus has been shown to oxidize fatty acids when catalysis is supported by a surrogate (mesophilic) electron donor system consisting of putidaredoxin and putidaredoxin reductase [14]. The crystal structure of CYP119 has been determined and the protein has been shown to undergo an unusually large active site conformational change upon binding of imidazoles of diVerent sizes [17]. The native substrate for CYP119, if any, is unknown. The structure of the thermophilic P450 enzyme from Thermus thermophilus, CYP175A1, which appears to be a carotene hydroxylase [19], has also been determined [20]. The native redox partners of both of these thermophilic enzymes have remained obscure despite their potential utility in the biotechnological reconstitution of high-temperature P450-based catalytic systems. In a preliminary communication, we reported that CYP119 readily accepts electrons from a surrogate electron donor system isolated from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, a distinct strain of Sulfolobus [21]. This system was highly unusual in that the ultimate source of electrons was neither NADH nor NADPH, but rather a 2-oxoacid such as pyruvic acid [21]. Here we report identiWcation, isolation, and characterization of the native electron donor partners of CYP119 in S. solfataricus itself. As found earlier for the Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 surrogate partners, the electron supply system consists of a ferredoxin and a heterodimeric protein that utilizes pyruvic acid as the ultimate source of electrons. However, there are signiWcant diVerences between the electron transfer proteins from S. solfataricus and Sulfolobus sp. strain 7. These results establish an entirely new class of electron donors for P450 enzymes and make possible the reconstitution of a high-temperature P450 catalytic system.

LKB Biotechnology (Piscataway, NJ). All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pT-groE was kindly provided by Prof. Shunsuke Ishii (Tsukuba, Japan) [22]. [1-14C]Lauric acid (55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radio Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Water was puriWed by the Milli-Q puriWcation system (Millipore). All other chemicals in this study were analytical grade. Molecular cloning and expression in E. coli of the ferredoxin gene from S. solfataricus P2 The ferredoxin structural gene was ampliWed by PCR from genomic DNA using a 5 -sense oligonucleotide primer containing an NdeI restriction site and a 3 reverse complementary primer with a BamHI site (see Table 1). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated to the expression vector pET-11a carrying a T7 promoter (Novagen). The coding region of the construct was sequenced to ensure that no error had been introduced into the coding region by the PCR ampliWcation. A pET-11a plasmid with the Fdx-Ss1 encoding gene was transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold plysS competent cells. The other steps of expression and puriWcation were similar to those reported for puriWcation of ferredoxin from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus sp. strain 7. This involved Q-Sepharose FF, Butyl-Sepharose, and Superdex-75 (Pharmacia) chromatographic steps for puriWcation of the protein [23]. Construction of the expression plasmid for the 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from S. solfataricus P2 The - and -subunits of OFOR-Ss were cloned separately. The genes for the - and -subunits were ampliWed by PCR from genomic DNA using a 5 -sense oligonucleotide primer containing an NdeI restriction site and a 3 -reverse complementary primer with an SpeI restriction site (see Table 1). The PCR products were digested with NdeI and SpeI, and ligated into the expression vector pET-17b (Novagen) carrying a T7 promoter. The coding regions of the constructs were sequenced to ensure that no error was introduced in the PCR ampliWcation step. The structural gene of the -subunit with a ribosome binding site of pET-17b was ampliWed from the -subunit/pET-17b plasmid using a 5 -sense oligonucleotide primer containing an SpeI restriction site and a 3 reverse complementary primer containing a 6-His region

with an XhoI restriction site (see Table 1). The PCR products were digested with SpeI and XhoI and ligated to the -subunit/pET-17b plasmid digested by the same restriction enzymes (see Fig. 3). Production and puriWcation of recombinant 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase OFOR-Ss/pET-17b and pT-groE plasmids were transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Gold plysS competent cells. The colonies were picked and transferred to 5­ 10 ml LB media containing 100 g/ml ampicillin and 34 g/ml chloramphenicol and were shaken overnight at 37 °C and 220 rpm. Each liter of TB media containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin and 34 g/ml of chloramphenicol was inoculated with 5­10 ml of overnight culture. The cells were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.8­1.0. The induction was started by IPTG (1 mM Wnal concentration). After 4­6 h the cells were harvested for 15 min at 4000 rpm and resuspended in 50 mM Tris buVer, pH 7.6. The cell suspension was incubated with lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, and protease inhibitors (0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl Xuoride, 0.5 g/ml leupeptin, 2 g/ml aprotinin, and 1 g/ml pepstatin, Wnal concentrations) were added directly before sonication. After sonication the lysed cell suspension was heated at 60 °C for 15 min to denature E. coli proteins. The resulting mixture was centrifuged (35,000g, 30 min) to remove denaturated E. coli proteins. The supernatant was applied to a 1 £ 6 cm Ni­NTA (Invitrogen) column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate buVer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 M NaCl. After washing the column with 50 mM potassium phosphate buVer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole the protein was eluted from the Ni­NTA resin with 50 mM potassium phosphate buVer, pH 8.0, containing

0.5 M NaCl and 100 mM imidazole. The protein was dialyzed against 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and then applied to a 1 £ 7 cm Q-Sepharose column. The protein solution that passed through the Q-Sepharose column was concentrated on an Amicon cell Wtted with a YM30 membrane. The protein obtained after each of these puriWcation steps is shown in Fig. 4. General procedures Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 1E UV­ Vis spectrometer (Varian, Victoria, Australia) or a Hewlett­Packard 8452A UV­Vis diode array spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA). A high-pressure liquid chromatograph coupled to a Packard Radiomatic Flow-One model A500 radioisotope detector was used for detection of 14 C-labeled compounds. SDS­PAGE was done on NuPAGE bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen, CA). The amount of TPP in OFOR-Ss was determined by Xuorescence spectroscopy on a Spextra MAX Gemini XS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) microplate Xuorimeter according to the method of Penttinen [24] in which TPP is oxidized to a Xuorescent thiochrome by alkalineferricyanide treatment. A 200 l aliquot of protein solution (4.2 M) was mixed with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to remove the protein and the supernatant was washed with diethylether and then analyzed directly. CYP119 activity assay Lauric acid hydroxylation by CYP119 was carried out as previously reported [14,21]. The reaction was started by addition of CoA or a mixture of pyruvate, lauric acid, and CoA. For long term incubations at high temperatures the protein or substrate solutions were stored in small glass vials (12 £ 35 mm) with screw caps.

Hydroxylated lauric acid formation was determined by HPLC analysis using 14C-labeled lauric acid. Metal analysis Metal analysis was performed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) by Garatt­Callahan (Millbrae, CA). The protein sample was Wrst extensively dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium acetate buVer. The dialysis buVer was passed through a column packed with Chelex-100 sodium form (Bio-Rad) to remove divalent cations. All the glassware was washed with 20% HNO3 and rinsed with Chelex-treated water prior to use.

Results and discussion Ferredoxin from S. solfataricus P2 Recombinant Fdx-Ss was puriWed to electrophoretic homogeneity as described under Materials and methods. The puriWed Fdx-Ss gave a single band on 10% SDS­ PAGE (Fig. 1). The present expression system yielded about 4.5 mg of puriWed ferredoxin/6 L culture (46 g wet weight of cells). The amino sequence of Fdx-Ss is close to that of Fdx-St and has the same total number (i.e., 104) of residues. Sequence comparisons were carried out using the BLAST programs. There are 7 amino acid diVerences between the amino sequences of these two proteins. Fdx-Ss contains the one aspartate and seven cysteine residues that serve as ligands to the 7Fe cluster that is also found in Fdx-St, as well as the common zinc binding motif VXGXHXGHX-//-PXXLGXHGTX-//KXDPV in which the three histidines and the aspartic acid are ligated to the zinc atom [27­29].

For metal analysis the Fdx-Ss preparations were dialyzed against divalent metal-free ammonium acetate buVer and analyzed for the presence of 21 diVerent metal ions by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy. The results conWrmed the presence of iron and zinc in the Fdx sample. The stoichiometry was calculated as 6.8 and 1.3 Eq of iron and zinc per 1 mol of enzyme, respectively, based on the measured 408 value of 29,000 M¡1 cm¡1 that corresponds to the 7Fe cluster [25]. No other divalent cation was detected in the sample. The only other metal observed was sodium, which was a result of treatment of the dialysis buVer with the sodium form of Chelex-100. The dialysis buVer analyzed as a control also contained sodium and a signiWcant amount of no other metal ion. The molecular weight, including seven atoms of iron, eight sulWdes, and one atom of zinc calculated from the amino acid composition is 11,755 which Wts well with SDS­PAGE data (see Fig. 1). As indicated, the sequences of the ferredoxins from Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7 and S. solfataricus P2 are very similar. Therefore it can be assumed that Fdx-Ss has the same [3Fe­4S] and [4Fe­4S] clusters as Fdx-St, in which only the [3Fe­4S] cluster is responsible for redox electron transfer during the oxidation of pyruvate, while the [4Fe­4S] cluster is involved not in catalysis but rather in maintenance of the structure [26,27]. As in FdxSt, the zinc ion can play an important role in stabilizing the structure of Fdx-Ss by connecting the N-terminal extension and core fold [23,27]. Fig. 2 shows the optical absorption spectra of puriWed Fdx-Ss, which is similar to that of Fdx-St [25]. It exhibits maxima at 280 and 408 nm (A408/A280 D 0.68) and a shoulder at 310 nm in the air-oxidized state that is aVorded by our puriWcation procedure. The spectrum of the puriWed protein gave a calculated purity index (A408/A280) of 0.68. The maximum purity index reported for Fdx-St was 0.7 [25], but Fdx-Ss has one more tyrosine than Fdx-St, which strengthens the UV-absorbance at 280 nm. Experiments

2-Oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from S. solfataricus P2 The expression system constructed here for OFOR-Ss (see Fig. 3) yielded about 1.5 mg of puriWed enzyme from 1 L culture. The DNA sequence predicts 632 amino acids for the -subunit and 316 residues for the -subunit, corresponding to molecular weights of 70,228 and 35,030, respectively. Recently the amino acid sequence of OFOR from S. tokodaii strain 7 was compared with the amino acid sequences of Wve other well-known ( )2-type 2oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductases, including those from Thauera aromatica, Bacillus halodurans, Halobacterium sp. strain NRC-1, Thermotoga maritima, and Staphylococcus aureus [28]. The conserved amino acid motifs that probably act as cofactor binding sites were detected in all of them. We have compared the sequences of the OFOR proteins from S. solfataricus P2 and S. tokodaii strain 7 (Table 2). Although the amino acid sequences of these two enzymes are very diVerent, the same conserved amino acid OFOR motifs are observed. Theoretically, one molecule of OFOR-Ss should have one [4Fe­4S] cluster and one TPP molecule as well as a CoA binding site. OFOR-Ss has only four cysteines that can coordinate the [4Fe­4S] cluster, all of which are located in the -subunit. The stoichiometry of TPP in OFOR-Ss determined by Xuorescence spectroscopy gives a value of 1 mol/mol protein. The protein concentration was determined using the 280 value of 111,870 M¡1 cm¡1 calculated, according to the Edelhoch method [29], from the amino acid composition. The program Sednterp v. 1.03 by D.B. Hayes, T. Laue, and J. Philo (http:// www.rasmb.bbri.org/) was used for this calculation. The BCA (Pierce, Rockford IL) protein assay with BSA as standard gave a value 7 times higher than that estimated from the UV data. This high overestimate of the protein concentration has been observed for other FeS proteins [30,31,25,32]. It should be mentioned that TPP can also itself interfere in the BCA assay. Inductively coupled plasma emission analysis gave an unexpectedly low value of 0.6 Eq (rather than the expected 4 Eq) of iron per 1 mol of enzyme in the protein sample. Cu was also detected with a stoichiometry of 0.2 Eq copper/1 mol protein. The low titer of Fe may be due to artifacts introduced by the protein sequence, cofactors, or puriWcation scheme. The presence of Cu was observed earlier for pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus [33]. Theoretically, the molecular weights of the - and -subunits, including four atoms of iron, four sulWde residues, one molecule of TPP, and the 6-His tag are 70,228 and 36,657, values that are in a good agreement with the SDS­PAGE data (Fig. 4). The optical spectrum of the puriWed OFOR-Ss had a peak at 280 nm and broad shoulder around 410 nm, characteristic of FeS proteins with [4Fe­4S] clusters (Fig. 5). The putative catalytic

prior to isolation of the OFOR-Ss showed that the rate of lauric acid hydroxylation by CYP119 at 36 °C with ferredoxin reductase from Spinacia oleracea as one of the redox partners was two times higher with Fdx-Ss than with Fdx-St (data not shown).

cycle of the OFOR-Ss is presumably the same as was described earlier for the OFOR from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 [30], in which the [4Fe­4S] cluster and TPP are localized in the catalytic active site of the -subunit. Optimizing reaction conditions Incubation of the reconstituted system consisting of CYP119, OFOR-Ss, Fdx-Ss, pyruvate, CoA, and lauric acid at 60 °C over a range of pH values showed that the activity of the reconstituted system was maximal at approximately pH 4.5 (Fig. 6), with a sharp drop from pH 4.5 to 5.5. This pH optimum is markedly diVerent from that reported for the OFOR from S. tokadaii, for which a pH optimum of 8 has been reported [34], although the pH optimum of that enzyme in the CYP119 assay is not known and could diVer. The temperature dependence of the reaction catalyzed by the reconstituted system (Fig. 7) shows that maximum conversion of lauric acid to hydroxylated fatty acid products occurs at approximately 70 °C, although only a small decrease in activity was observed as the temperature was increased up to 90 °C because more rapid denaturation of the protein was compensated for by the higher initial rate of product formation. Product formation, as expected, was much lower at

30 °C. When the incubation was carried out at 70 °C, linear conversion to product was observed for approximately the Wrst hour, with a somewhat lower rate of conversion after that time (Fig. 8). Analysis of the conversion of lauric acid to hydroxylated products in the presence of diVerent ratios of S. solfataricus Fdx-Ss to OFOR-Ss (Fig. 9) shows that good activity is achieved with an Fdx-Ss:OFOR-Ss ratio of 20 both at pH 4.5 and 6.0, although maximum activity

The protein concentrations were: CYP119 (0.3 M), Fdx-Ss (2.5 M), and OFORSs (0.1 M). After this preincubation time, CoA, pyruvate, and lauric acid were added to the Wnal concentrations in Fig. 7 and the activity was measured at 70 °C. The values in line 1 are reported as means of triplicate determinations § SD.

requires approximately a 40:1 Fdx-Ss:OFOR-Ss ratio. Our data not only show with the native electron donor partners that the catalytic activity of CYP119 is higher at acidic than basic pH, but also that electron transfer from Fdx-Ss to CYP119 is the rate limiting step of the reaction (Fig. 9). It is of interest that the optimal Fdx:OFOR-Ss ratio is independent of pH. Thermal stability of system components As already mentioned, the highest catalytic turnover is achieved at »70 °C (Fig. 7), but a decline in activity is observed upon prolonged incubation at that temperature (Fig. 8). To determine which protein limits the thermal stability of the reconstituted system, experiments were carried out in which each of the three proteins was preincubated at either 70 or 0 °C prior to reconstituting the catalytic system. The results indicate that the thermal system is limited by the stability of the OFOR-Ss component. Thus, preincubation of all three components at 70 °C results in much lower catalytic activity in the subsequent lauric acid oxidation assay. This irreversible decrease in activity can be completely abrogated if the

OFOR-Ss is preincubated at 0 °C and the other two enzymes at 70 °C (Fig. 10). Thus, CYP119 and Fdx-Ss are stable for prolonged times at 70 °C, but the activity of OFOR-Ss decreases upon incubation at this temperature. The decrease in OFOR-Ss activity is thus responsible for the decrease in the catalytic activity of the complete reconstituted system when incubated at high temperature for approximately 1 h (Fig. 8). It is notable that the activity of OFOR-Ss decreases but is not completely suppressed by preincubation at 70 °C (Fig. 10). OFOR-Ss thus undergoes a temperaturedependent structural alteration that diminishes but does not completely eliminate activity. The reason for this decreased activity of OFOR-Ss is not known, but the loss of activity at 70 °C (Fig. 10) is typical for thermoinactivation of oligomeric proteins. Thermoinactivation typically reXects dissociation of the oligomer into subunits, condensation into larger aggregates, or changes in conformation of one or more of the subunits [35­38]. Furthermore, it is also known that residual activity can be retained upon dissociation of oligomeric enzymes into subunits [36­38]. In OFOR-Ss, the - and -subunits are completely diVerent and play diVerent roles in the protein, as reported earlier for OFOR-St [30]. We have individually expressed and partially puriWed the and -subunits of OFOR-Ss, but catalytic activity was not obtained when the system was reconstituted by mixing equimolar amounts of the two subunits and preincubating the mixture at diVerent temperatures and time intervals (data not shown). However, independent expression of the individual subunits may produce dena-

Fig. 11. Dependence of the CYP119 lauric acid hydroxylase activity on the time of incubation of the proteins at diVerent pH values at 70 °C. CYP119, OFOR-Ss, and Fdx-Ss were incubated together at 70 °C. The protein concentrations were: CYP119 (0.4 M), Fdx-Ss (2.5 M), and OFOR-Ss (0.1 M). After the preincubation time, CoA, pyruvate, and lauric acid were added to the same Wnal concentrations as in Fig. 7 and the activity was measured at 70 °C. [1] P.R. Ortiz de Montellano, J.J.

tured proteins that are not equivalent to those obtained upon dissociation of the intact complex. As shown in Fig. 11, loss of activity occurs at pH 4.5, the optimum pH, whereas at pH 7.0, although the overall activity is much lower, prolonged incubation results in a modest increase rather than decrease in activity. As mentioned earlier (Fig. 6), the catalytic activity is strongly pH dependent, with high activity associated with the intact oligomeric state of OFOR-Ss present at low pH. This activity is diminished upon prolonged incubation at that pH. However, at high pH, the protein is present in a low activity state, and the activity of this state is modestly increased with time upon incubation at high pH. Partial inactivation in one hand and activation in the other suggests that the "denatured" state has higher activity at high pH. In this context, it is to be noted that the high pH activity remains lower than that of the "denatured" protein obtained after incubation at low pH.

Conclusions We report here identiWcation, cloning, expression, isolation, and characterization of the natural S. solfataricus P2 electron donor partners for CYP119, a thermophilic P450 enzyme from this same organism. This is the Wrst time that the natural donor partners of a thermophilic enzyme have been identiWed and characterized. The immediate electron donor, as in many P450 enzymes, is a ferredoxin protein, but the ferredoxin is reduced by a 2oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Thus, CYP119 is the Wrst P450 enzyme that does not derive its reducing
