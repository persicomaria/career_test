ABSTRACT:

Enzymes with nucleoside hydrolase activity (NHs) belonging to homology group I either are markedly specific for pyrimidine nucleoside substrates or hydrolyze with comparable efficiencies the N-glycosidic bond in all common nucleosides. The biochemical and structural basis for these differences in substrate specificity is still unknown. Here we characterize the binding interactions between the slowly hydrolyzed substrate inosine and the Escherichia coli pyrimidine-specific NH YeiK using cryotrapping and X-ray crystallography. Guided by the structural features of the Michaelis complex, we show the synergic effect of two specific point mutations in YeiK that increase the catalytic efficiency toward purine nucleosides to values comparable to those of natural nonspecific NHs. We demonstrate that the integrity of an active-site catalytic triad comprised of two hydroxylated amino acids and one histidine residue is a requirement for the highly efficient hydrolysis of inosine by group I NHs. Instead, cleavage of the YeiK-preferred substrate uridine is not affected by mutations at the same locations, suggesting a different fine chemical mechanism for the hydrolysis of the two nucleoside substrates. Our study provides for the first time direct evidence that distinct subsets of amino acid residues are involved in the hydrolysis of purine or pyrimidine nucleosides in group I NHs.

Nucleoside hydrolases are widespread Ca2+-dependent metalloenzymes that efficiently catalyze the hydrolytic excision of the N-glycosidic bond in nucleosides (1, 2). Their biological function is well-established in purine-auxotrophic protozoa such as trypanosomes, where they are involved in the recycling pathway of nitrogenous bases for subsequent nucleotide synthesis (3). Because of their central role in providing these essential building blocks for the parasite life cycle, NHs1 are considered attractive targets for rational drug design (1). On the other hand, the functional role performed by NHs in prokaryotes and higher eukaryotes is still debated, and existing data point to highly specialized and diverse functions such as prevention of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (4) or reduction of the perception of micropredation by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (5).

uridine hydrolase from the yeast Saccharmomyces cereVisiae to the metabolism of the nucleoside nicotinamide riboside in NAD+ homeostasis. These studies implicated a role of the yeast hydrolase in elevating NAD+ levels in calorie restriction, and in extending the lifespan through a Sir2dependent mechanism (6). While it is yet unknown whether the bacterial enzymes may be involved in similar cellular mechanisms, these findings raise the provocative possibility that NHs could be active in biochemical pathways alternative to nucleotide catabolism. These functional studies require a parallel detailed definition of the biochemical and structural properties of NHs. Enzymes with NH activity are classified on the basis of their substrate specificity as purine-specific (IAG-NH) (7, 8), nonspecific (IU-NH) (9), pyrimidine-specific (CU-NH) (10), and 6-oxopurine-specific (GI-NH) (11). NHs can be also grouped according to sequence homology and conservation of active-site residues (10). This classification allows the immediate distinction between pyrimidine- and purinespecific enzymes based upon the presence of either a histidine or a tryptophan residue at a critical active-site position (10). However, homology group I includes both nonspecific and pyrimidine-specific NHs, which share a high degree (30­70%) of sequence identity but have distinct substrate specificities. Indeed, while IU-NHs cleave the N-glycosidic bond in both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides with comparable catalytic efficiencies, CU-NHs show 102-104-fold faster hydrolysis of cytidine or uridine compared to purine nucleosides (10, 12). The biochemical and structural basis for these differences in substrate specificity is yet to be clarified. One possibility is that IU-NHs are acquired-function mutants of CU-NHs, and specific amino acids are present to stabilize the transition

Substrate Specificity of Nucleoside Hydrolases state for purine nucleoside hydrolysis. Alternatively, CUNH enzymes could be endowed with specific active-site features that selectively discriminate the leaving group of pyrimidine nucleosides. Kinetic isotope effect studies on the IU-NH from Crithidia fasciculata demonstrated that the NHcatalyzed cleavage of inosine proceeds through the distortion of substrate toward an oxonium cation geometry via groundstate destabilization (13). A partial negative charge develops at the nitrogenous base, and protonation of the leaving group is thus required for efficient catalysis. A conserved activesite histidine is a likely candidate for this role (14). Also, it is still unknown whether the same strategy is used for the stabilization of the negative charge in the NH-catalyzed purine and pyrimidine nucleoside hydrolysis. In this work, we address these open questions through the crystallographic characterization of the Michaelis complex between the CUNH YeiK (RihB) from Escherichia coli and inosine, and sitedirected mutagenesis (10, 15). We engineered two specific active-site mutations that elicit a 50-fold increase in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward inosine, demonstrating that IU-NHs are characterized by a catalytic triad, composed of one histidine and two tyrosine residues, allowing the efficient protonation of the purine base. Surprisingly, the mutations introduced into the YeiK enzyme did not affect the hydrolysis of uridine, suggesting that these residues are employed differently by the homologous CU- and IU-NH enzymes for the hydrolysis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. MATERIALS AND METHODS Site-Directed Mutagenesis of YeiK. The single-amino acid mutants T223A, T223F, T223Y, Q227A, Q227F, and Q227Y and the double mutants T223F/Q227Y (termed FY) and T223Y/Q227Y (YY) were generated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase. Single-point mutants were generated from the pET28-YEIK template, bearing the K12 E. coli yeiK gene (16). Reaction mixtures were primed with two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides, designed to include the desired mutation at the central codon, at a concentration of 1 µM. The FY and YY double mutants were generated by introducing the second Q223Y or T223Y mutation on the pET28 vector bearing the T223F or Q227Y variant of the YeiK gene. PCRs with a hot start protocol were carried out by cycles of denaturation at 94 °C, annealing, and extension at 68 °C. The annealing temperature and the number of cycles in the reaction were optimized according to the number of bases to be mutated (Table 1). A final extension for 15 min at 72 °C was included for all mutants. The parental permethylated DNA was digested with the endonuclease DpnI (17). The reaction product, corresponding to the mutated nicked plasmid DNA, was purified using PCRQuick spin columns (Promega) prior to transformation, to improve the efficiency, into chemically competent TOP10 E. coli cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated from single colonies and sequenced on both DNA strands using the automated dideoxy method. Expression and Purification of YeiK and Its Variants. Wild-type and mutated YeiK were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and purified as previously described using NiNTA affinity and size exclusion chromatography (16). The N-terminal hexahistidine tag was cleaved from the enzymes via quantitative digestion using thrombin in a 1:1000 (w/w)

The quantitative incorporation of the desired mutation(s) into the purified protein was verified through partial proteolysis with trypsin, followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the resulting peptide mixture. The protein concentration was determined using the following molar absorption coefficients at 280 nm: 23.3 mM-1 · cm-1 for YeiK wild-type, 22.9 mM-1 cm-1 for T223A, 22.9 mM-1 cm-1 for T223F, 24.4 mM-1 cm-1 for T223Y, 22.9 mM-1 cm-1 for Q227A, 22.9 mM-1 cm-1 for Q227F, 24.2 mM-1 cm-1 for Q227Y, 24.4 mM-1 cm-1 for FY, 25.0 mM-1 cm-1 for YY, and 22.5 mM-1 cm-1 for H239A. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of URH1p from S. cereVisiae. The urh1 gene was cloned using PCR from genomic S. cereVisiae DNA. Forward and reverse primers based on the deposited gene sequence (GenBank accession number 37362635) were engineered to contain NheI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5- and 3-ends, respectively. The proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase was employed to prevent nucleotide misincorporation. The PCR product was directionally cloned in the TOPO-pET101 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both DNA strands. The urh1 gene was then subcloned between the NheI and XhoI sites of a pET28b vector. The pET28-URH1 plasmid was transformed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) cells for protein production. An overnight bacterial culture was diluted 1:10 in Luria-Bertani broth containing 1% glucose, 50 µg/mL kanamycin, and 34 µg/ mL chloramphenicol and grown under vigorous shaking (210 rpm) to an OD600 of 0.6. The culture was cooled to 20 °C, and protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.25 mM. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after 16 h, resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche), and lysed using a Bandelin sonifier. The supernatant was mixed for 3 h at room temperature with NiNTA resin (350 µL/L of cell culture) and packed onto a polypropylene column, and unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing with 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole. Bound URH1p was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration of 500 mM. The protein was dialyzed against a buffer composed of 20 mM Tris (pH 8.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2 and incubated with a 1:200 (w/w) solution of bovine thrombin (Sigma) for 16 h at 4 °C. URH1p was dialyzed overnight in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), loaded onto a MonoQ anion exchange column, and

eluted with a linear KCl gradient. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Quantitative removal of the affinity tag was assessed by Western blotting with an anti-hexahistidine antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and luminol detection. Protein preparations were >95% pure, as judged from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Steady-State Kinetic Analysis. Kinetic parameters for wildtype YeiK, site-specific mutants, and URH1p were determined using a colorimetric or spectrophotometric assay. The NH colorimetric test based on the reducing sugar assay was performed as previously described (9). Kinetic measurements were recorded on a UltroSpec UV spectrophotometer, monitoring continuously the variation in absorbance at the appropriate wavelengths (for uridine, at 280 nm,  ) -2.0 µM-1 cm-1; for inosine, at 280 nm,  ) -0.82 µM-1 cm-1). The concentration of substrate was varied between 0.1KM and 10KM, and initial velocities were measured for a minimum of eight points. Enzymatic reactions were performed in 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.3) at 37 °C. Kinetic parameters were obtained via a direct fit to initial velocities to the Michaelis­Menten equation using GraphPad Prism. All kinetic parameters are calculated per active site, and they were, thus, independent of the multimerization state of the enzyme. X-ray Crystallography. Wild-type YeiK at 8­9 mg/mL in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, mixing equal volumes of protein solution and a precipitant solution consisting of 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 24% PEG 4000. A single crystal was harvested and equilibrated into a stabilizing solution containing 100 mM Hepes (pH 8.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 34% PEG 4000. The crystal was then transferred for 2 min in the same solution containing 50 mM inosine, mounted on a fiber loop, and immediately dipped into liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to 2.3 Å resolution were collected on a RAXIS-IV++ imaging plate detector coupled to a MicroMax007 X-ray generator with a copper target and Osmic optics using the oscillation method at 100 K. Data were indexed, integrated, scaled, and reduced to unique reflections with XDS (18). Since the crystal unit cell was chosen with a different setting (acute angles, as per IUCr guidelines) with respect to the deposited YeiK structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1Q8F), the orientation of the YeiK tetramer was determined using the molecular replacement method as implemented in MOLREP (19) after all ligand and water molecules had been removed. The structure was subjected to cycles of restrained energy minimization with a maximum likelihood target function using REFMAC5 (20) followed by manual rebuilding into A-weighted electron density maps with COOT (21). Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were maintained for the four YeiK chains present in the crystal cell. Because of structural differences, the restraints were set to medium and loose for residues 221-238 and 78-101, respectively. Residue Arg175 had different conformations in all molecules and was hence excluded from noncrystallographic symmetry restraints. Solvent molecules were added to the model using COOT. All residues in the refined model have dihedral angles ( and ) belonging to the allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot. Details of data collection and final refinement statistics are presented in Table 2.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Crystal Structure of the YeiK-Inosine Michaelis Complex. The structures of several group I NHs have been previously determined, but detailed experimental information about the NH-substrate contacts are still missing. Steady-state kinetics of YeiK showed that inosine is a poor substrate, characterized by a millimolar KM and a low turnover number (Table 3). Taking advantage of this relatively slow conversion of inosine by YeiK (0.086 s-1, corresponding to one turnover every 11.6 s), we cryotrapped at 100 K the YeiK-inosine complex and determined its crystal structure to 2.3 Å resolution. Electron density maps showed the presence of an active-site ligand only when the crystals were soaked for more than 30 s. The overall structure of YeiK is unaffected by binding of inosine (Figure 1A). One of the four independent YeiK subunits in the crystal displays the closed conformation, typical of group I NH enzymes bound to substrate-mimicking ligands (9, 23). The other three monomers instead display different degrees of flexibility in the 3-R3 loop and R9 helix, reminiscent of the open ligandfree or product-bound structures of NHs (11, 22, 24). The substrate binds as expected to the Ca2+-containing active site in the catalytic cavity at the C-terminal end of the core -sheet. The ribosyl moiety adopts a distorted C4-endo conformation that confirms that ground-state destabilization is a driving force for NH catalysis. The hypoxanthine base is bound in a conformation that is intermediate between syn and anti ( ) 52°, dihedral angle defined by atoms O4, C1, N9, and C4), with the C1-C2 bond of ribose substantially

coplanar with respect to the purine ring (Figure 1B). The aglycone is not fully defined in the electron density due to the catalysis that occurred within the crystal and was optimally refined with an occupancy of 70%. This partial occupancy may also explain the observed open structure in three YeiK monomers in the crystal. The hypoxanthine base is closely approached by the 3-R3 loop, making extensive van der Waals contacts with the conserved residues Ile81 and His82.2 In particular, the apolar contacts with the side chain atoms of Ile81 force the base in an axial conformation with respect to the ribose by reducing the conformational space available to the purine ring (Figure 1C). His82 instead approaches the five-membered ring of hypoxanthine in a T-shaped interaction that may provide additional binding energy (25). The purine ring also establishes van der Waals contact with the highly conserved Phe165 residue, as well as with Phe159. The terminal residue of helix R9, Tyr231, acts as a lid on top of the enzyme active site and closely approaches the purine base with the phenol ring carbons in an apparently unfavorable C-O van der Waals contact. Hydrogen bonding interactions are established between the hypoxanthine ring N7 and O6 atoms and the side chain amide group of Gln227. The phenolic oxygen of the Tyr231 side chain is also involved in polar contacts with the base N1 atom, providing additional binding energy. Although it cannot be established at the resolution of this structure, the interactions observed support a preferred tautomerization of the hypoxanthine ring toward the iminol form when bound to YeiK. Alternatively, inosine may be bound in the more represented keto tautomer, and the repulsive interactions between the Gln227 side chain carbonyl and O6 may account for its low affinity for YeiK. The side chain of His239, the residue proposed to act as a general acid in group I NHs, is 3.2 Å from the N7 atom of the hypoxanthine base. The imidazolium ring is in a perpendicular orientation with respect to the base ring that is unfavorable for proton transfer (Figure 1C). Mutation of His239 to alanine in the Crithidia IU-NH dramatically reduces the rate of inosine hydrolysis, and its contribution to catalysis amounts to -4.6 kcal/mol (14). The distance and geometry of this interaction in the Michaelis complex may prevent an efficient neutralization of the negative charge at the transition state and thus explain the slow turnover of inosine by YeiK.
2 Because of the differences in the numbering of the amino acids in different group I NH enzymes, protein residues are numbered in this work according to the numbering of the pyrimidine nucleoside hydrolase YeiK sequence. For clarity, residues 223, 227, and 239 of YeiK correspond to Tyr225, Tyr229, and His241, respectively, in the Crithidia IU-NH. An alignment of the sequences at the R9 helices of the enzymes discussed in the text is provided in Figure 5.

We modeled a molecule of inosine into the active site of the Crithidia IU-NH, a group I NH that efficiently hydrolyzes purine nucleosides (Figure 2) in the same conformation that was observed in YeiK. In this enzyme, Gln227 is substituted with a tyrosine whose side chain hydroxyl closely approaches both the N7 and O6 atoms of hypoxanthine, with a high potential for retaining a hydrogen bonding interaction. Tyr231 of YeiK is replaced with an arginine, closing the top of the active-site cavity and within hydrogen bonding distance of the N1 atom of the base. A second tyrosine residue, replacing Thr223 of YeiK, is adequately positioned for establishing polar interactions with the purine N7 atom. This residue may provide hydrophobic binding interactions with the purine ring and is also interacting with both Tyr227 and His239 via its side chain hydroxyl. These four residues belong to the R9 helix that borders the NH active site and are not conserved in the pyrimidine-specific CU-NHs (9). Instead, both Leishmania and Crithidia IU-NHs display two tyrosines at positions 223 and 227 (Figure 2). Molecular dynamics studies suggested a possible role of Tyr227 in catalysis (27). We investigated whether the concomitant presence of two tyrosines at these sites is a requirement for IU-NH activity by enzymes belonging to NH homology group I. A Double Mutation ConVerts the CU-NH YeiK into a IUNH. To assess whether a single tyrosine in the R9 helix was sufficient to enhance the catalytic efficiency of YeiK toward purine nucleosides, we individually mutated residues Thr223 and Gln227 of the E. coli YeiK CU-NH to tyrosine. The T223Y mutation does not affect the specificity of the enzyme toward inosine or uridine, as a consequence of compensating variations in kcat and KM (Table 3). The Q227Y mutation instead has a strong, enhancing effect on the hydrolysis of inosine, and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) for the purinic substrate is increased by a factor of 7.6, as a result of a specific increase in kcat. This variation corresponds to an overall stabilization of the transition state of the hydrolytic cleavage of inosine by -1.2 kcal/mol, as judged from the variation of the pseudo second-order rate constant kcat/KM. To demonstrate a specific role for tyrosine residues at positions 223 and 227 in group I NHs in producing IU-NHlike activity, we also mutated these amino acids to alanine or phenylalanine. These mutations do not improve significantly the catalytic efficiency of YeiK toward inosine, with all variations to the overall Gq being below (kBT and thus due to weak interactions (Figure 3). In particular, the Q227F mutant shows a 4-fold lower efficiency than the Q227Y mutant, confirming the role of this tyrosine hydroxyl in catalysis. The introduction of a Phe residue at position

The model in panel A was obtained by superposition of YeiK bound to inosine with the closed IU-NH structure observed in the complex with a transition-state-like inhibitor (23). The model in panel B was obtained on the basis of the inhibitor conformation in the IUNH-pAPIR complex (26). Dashed blue lines represent possible hydrogen bonds between the enzyme and the base. Dashed pink lines depict the interactions between the residues of the Tyr-TyrHis triad. Tyr227 is properly oriented for the formation of a hydrogen bond to the N7 atom of hypoxanthine. His239 is within the correct distance but is suboptimally oriented with respect to the acceptor atom. Instead, the O2 carbonyl of uridine is 2.7 Å from the side chain of His239 (dashed yellow line), and in a more favorable orientation for direct proton transfer.

223 severely impairs binding of substrate, suggesting that the bulky hydrophobic ring lacking a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor (such as the OH group in tyrosine) poses a steric constraint at the active site. Finally, we engineered a T223Y/Q227Y double mutant (YY) to mimic the R9 helix of known IU-NHs. The YY enzyme displays a catalytic efficiency toward inosine that is more than 50-fold increased compared to that of wild-type YeiK. The KM value for the substrate inosine is within experimental error compared to those of both wild-type YeiK and the Q227Y mutant. The enhanced transition-state stabilization is achieved through a more efficient chemical step, probably the consequence of an effective neutralization

of the negative charge at the leaving purine base. The double mutation effectively lowers the energetic barrier for inosine hydrolysis by a total of -2.4 kcal/mol, thus indicating that the effect of the mutations on the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme is not additive; rather, the two tyrosines synergize to stabilize the transition state (Figure 3). The favorable interaction between the two tyrosine residues (1.8 kcal/mol) overcomes the unfavorable effect of the individual Tyr223 mutation on inosine hydrolysis. The kinetic analysis of double mutant T223F/Q227Y (FY) shows that the hydrophobic contribution from the residue at position 223 is not sufficient to achieve optimal catalysis. Indeed, the increase in catalytic efficiency for this mutant compared to the wildtype enzyme is approximately 2-fold, compared to 51 for the YY mutant. This limited enhancement could be ascribed to both an inefficient proton transfer and poor binding of the substrate, as judged from the kcat and KM values (Table

Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 15, 2008 4423 strate contacts under the rapid equilibrium hypothesis. This difference can readily be ascribed to the fine-tuning of the active-site environment deriving from evolutionary pressure in natural IU-NH enzymes. The YY mutant is a bona fide IU-NH, being also active toward the purine nucleoside adenosine, with a kcat of 0.41 ( 0.04 s-1 and a KM of 3.75 ( 0.15 mM. Finally, the nucleoside tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) is hydrolyzed by the YY mutant at a rate of 0.013 s-1, highlighting the role of the N7 atom of purines in the hydrolytic mechanism. LeaVing Group ActiVation in Purine and Pyrimidine Nucleosides. The catalytic mechanism of group I NHs largely relies on the distortion of the ribosyl moiety toward an oxonium ion geometry, enhancing its reactivity with a Ca2+polarized water molecule (13, 23). The negative charge developing at the leaving group nitrogenous base must be stabilized through either protonation or specific polar interactions. The rate of hydrolysis of nucleosides in solution shows a linear dependence with pH in the range of 0­7, suggesting the protonated base as the reactive species. Kinetic isotope effect studies of the Crithidia IU-NH-catalyzed hydrolysis of inosine also indicates a pre-transition-state protonation at the N7 atom (13). Structural and mutagenesis studies identified His239 as a likely candidate for proton transfer (14). Our study demonstrates the requirement of a specific network of residues for the protonation of the purine ring. This catalytic triad formed by residued Tyr223, Tyr227, and His239 is, however, not needed for the hydrolysis of pyrimidine nucleosides, being absent in all CU-NHs thus far characterized. Moreover, all single and double mutations of residues 223 and 227 of YeiK have a minimal effect on the rate of hydrolysis of uridine compared to the wild-type enzyme (Table 3). Hence, the hydrolytic cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond in purine or pyrimidine nucleosides catalyzed by nonspecific group I NH enzymes relies on different residues for leaving group activation. How can the same NH enzyme perform a dual role in nucleoside hydrolysis? Purine and pyrimidine bases differ in their acid-base properties, and these differences are likely reflected in the mechanism of leaving group stabilization. As the NHcatalyzed hydrolysis of uridine proceeds along the reaction coordinate, a negative charge develops at the N1 atom of the base that can be delocalized to the O2 carbonyl. The N1-O2 imidate form of uracil has a pKa of 9.8 and could be protonated by amino acid residues with a pKa nearing neutral values, such as His239 in group I NHs. When a uridine molecule bound to the Crithidia IU-NH active site is modeled, the base O2 carbonyl is indeed placed within hydrogen bonding distance of His239 (Figure 4), suggesting a likely direct protonation by this residue. The transitionstate structure of E. coli RihC-catalyzed hydrolysis of uridine supports the hypothesis of the importance of enzymatic interactions with the carbonyl O2 atom for base activation (29). Moreover, mutation of His239 to alanine in YeiK results in a 10-fold decrease in kcat/KM for the substrate uridine (10). Alternative mechanisms include the stabilization of the anionic form of the base by the enzyme via polar interactions. For instance, several lines of evidence indicate that an uracilate anion is the leaving group in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme uracil DNA glycosidase (30). For this repair enzyme from E. coli, a single hydrogen bond to a neutral

The abscissa reports the different mutants, while the ordinate displays the Gq state for each mutant, representing the variation in the free energy of the transition state of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction compared to wild-type YeiK.

The horizontal dashed lines intersect the ordinate axis at the values of (kBT at 37 °C (0.62 kcal/mol) and represent the thermal energy at the temperature of the enzymatic assay. Effects within these values can be ascribed to weak interactions that are comparable to the thermal motion of the protein atoms.

3). Hence, these results clearly demonstrate that the hydroxyl groups of residues Tyr223 and Tyr227 cooperate to establish an efficient binding site and facilitate the activation of the leaving group in the hydrolysis of inosine. The integrity of the Tyr-Tyr-His triad is pivotal for optimal hydrolysis of purine nucleosides by group I NHs. All the mutations engineered at amino acids 223 and 227 of YeiK result in a large increase in kcat with uridine as the substrate, paralleled by proportional increments in KM, suggesting the introduction of a conformational strain on uridine that is beneficial for catalysis. Since diverse amino acid residues such as Ala, Phe, and Tyr have similar effects on KM, the mutations could affect the conformational change that takes place between the ligand-free and substrate-bound forms of YeiK. Notably, the YY mutant lowers by comparable amounts the activation energy for both uridine and inosine substrates, with 15- and 40-fold increases in kcat, respectively. Moreover, in this mutant, the 55-fold discrimination of YeiK in favor of uridine is reduced to 20-fold under saturating substrate conditions, implying an enhanced turnover of inosine through a more efficient chemical step. The engineered YY YeiK mutant displays a catalytic efficiency toward inosine (kcat/KM ) 1.9 × 103 M-1 s-1) approaching that of the IU-NHs from C. fasciculata (9), Leishmania major (24), and Salmonella enterica (28) that amount to 7.6 × 104, 2.7 × 105, and 1.4 × 104 M-1 s-1, respectively. Indeed, the turnover number of YY (kcat ) 3.6 s-1) favorably compares with those of the natural IU-NHs (119, 28, and 9 s-1, respectively), but the KM value is significantly higher (1.9 mM compared to 0.44, 0.36, and 0.65 mM, respectively), indicating suboptimal enzyme­sub-

Iovane et al. hydrolysis progresses, the negative charge developing at the ring increases the pKa of N7, facilitating its protonation. On the basis of this structural analysis, Tyr227 can interact with N7 of inosine in IU-NHs while Tyr223 and His239 do not directly contact the base (Figure 4). The geometry of the catalytic triad is thus suggestive of a central role performed by Tyr227 in the neutralization of the negative charge. One possibility is that its side chain hydroxyl could act as a bridge between the protonated His239 and the purine base, with Tyr223 cooperating in directing proton transfer. Alternatively, the simultaneous presence of Tyr223 and His239 could perturb the side chain pKa values, increasing the intrinsic propensity for proton transfer by Tyr227. Our study further demonstrates how the base activation mechanism is markedly different in group I NHs from the one employed by the Trypanosoma ViVax IAG-NH, belonging to homology group II. In this enzyme, aromatic ring stacking (31) and an intramolecular O5-C8 hydrogen bond (32) favored by the anti conformation of the nitrogenous base cooperate in increasing the N7 pKa to favor protonation of the leaving group directly from the solvent. Thus, group I and group II NHs share a common fold and strategy for ribosyl distortion and nucleophile activation in N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis but have evolved completely different mechanisms for promoting the departure of the nitrogenous base. Deciphering Substrate Specificity from the Sequence of Group I NHs. NH-like proteins are annotated in protein databases on the basis of the presence of the N-terminal DXDXXXDD motif, involved in the binding of the catalyticsite Ca2+ ion. The nature of the residue immediately preceding the aspartate that completes the coordination sphere of the divalent cation (Asp240 in YeiK)2 allows the distinction between purine-specific (group II) and either nonspecific or pyrimidine-specific NHs (group I) (10). Our identification of residues specifically involved in the hydrolysis of purine nucleosides defines further criteria that can be used to anticipate the substrate specificity of NHs. On the basis of these considerations, we analyzed the primary structures of NH-like proteins present in protein sequence databases (Figure 5). The majority of group I NHs in prokaryotes belong to the pyrimidine-specific CU-NH family, bearing a hydrophilic or charged amino acid corresponding to Gln227 of YeiK. This finding likely reflects a lesser need of purine nucleosidase activity in these organisms, since bacteria are generally capable of de noVo purine synthesis. Moreover, the catabolism of nitrogenous bases is performed by efficient nucleoside phosphorylases (1). The analysis of the primary structure of NH-like proteins present in databases highlights the fact that putative IU-NHs, carrying both Tyr223 and Tyr227, are largely found in purine-auxotrophic protozoan parasites, such as Leishmania, where nucleoside phosphorylase activity is absent (3). However, nonspecific isozymes are also annotated in bacterial species (Figure 5). For instance, the IU-NH-like activity of the RihC proteins from E. coli and S. enterica has been previously characterized (15, 28, 29). Bacterial RihC homologues are peculiar in their R9 helix sequence, since they show a shorter segment between helices R8 and R9 (Figure 5). This region could hence display a different spatial arrangement of amino acid residues at the active site. Indeed, preliminary characterization of the structure of the RihC IU-NH from E. coli shows

FIGURE 4: Proposed mechanism for the activation of the leaving groups in pyrimidine and purine nucleosides by group I NH enzymes. A common feature of the NH-catalyzed reaction inovolves the distortion of the ribosyl moiety of nucleosides toward an oxonium ion geometry, bearing a partial positive charge. Asp11 acts as a general base, removing a proton from an ordered water molecule and activating the nucleophile. Different active-site residues are involved in the neutralization of the developing negative charge at the nitrogenous base in purines or pyrimidines. The schemes represent the interactions between the IU-NH from C. fasciculata and the substrates (A) uridine and (B) inosine. (A) Residue His239, because of its proximity and favorable geometry, can directly transfer a proton to the carbonyl O2 atom of the leaving group uracil, neutralizing the negative charge. This mechanism is conserved in both IU- and CU-NH enzymes. (B) Instead, the proton required for activation of hypoxanthine is actively shuttled from His239 to the N7 atom of the purine ring via the Tyr227 side chain hydroxyl, while Tyr223 maintains the correct geometry of the triad and perhaps influences the hydroxyl pKa.

histidine was shown to assist the uracilate anion stabilization by shifting the nitrogenous base pKa to a value of 6.4. Hence, the uracil moiety of uridine could be similarly activated in the NH-catalyzed hydrolysis, achieving a stabilization of the negatively charged base via hydrogen bonding interactions. While further experiments are required to fully clarify such details of the NH-catalyzed hydrolysis of uridine, it is clear that, at least for the E. coli YeiK enzyme, residues Thr223 and Gln227 play a marginal role in stabilizing the transition state of the enzymatic reaction with uridine, with perhaps an effect on binding. Inosine is a poor substrate for wild-type YeiK, but the engineering of a IU-NH-like Tyr-Tyr-His triad greatly augments the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis. Hypoxanthine has a markedly different acid-base behavior compared to uridine, with an acidic N7 atom (pKa  2.3) and two other basic sites at N1 (pKa ) 9.9) and N9 (pKa ) 12.1). As

FIGURE 5: Primary structure alignment from the R9 helix region to the conserved His239 for group I NHs. The characterized CU-NHs and IU-NHs are aligned in the top part of the figure. Following, sample putative IU-NHs are annotated on the basis of the presence of either Tyr227 or Ser227 alone (bold orange typeface) in conjunction with Tyr223 (green). In the bottom part, putative CU-NHs are annotated on the basis of the absence of the complete catalytic triad. The numbering in the first row, corresponding to the primary structure of YeiK, is that followed throughout the text. The numbering of each sequence indicates the actual residue numbers for the corresponding protein.

that a Tyr223 homologue is indeed present, and Tyr227 is substituted with a serine (Figure 5) whose side chain hydroxyl establishes similar contacts with the neighboring residues (C. Minici and M. Degano, manuscript in preparation). Thus, it is conceivable that Tyr227 in IU-NHs could be substituted with a serine or threonine, provided that the shorter residue adequately approaches both the substrate and the other two components of the triad. To further confirm that the described catalytic triad is essential for IU-NH-like activity, we characterized the group I NH protein found in the proteome of the yeast S. cereVisiae, encoded by the urh1 gene. This putative yeast hydrolase lacks Tyr223 but maintains a Tyr227 residue (Figure 5). Given the strong, synergic effect deriving from the presence of all members of the catalytic triad, the urh1 gene is thus expected to encode a CU-NH enzyme. A uridine hydrolase enzyme has been previously partially purified from yeast (33), and the overexpression in yeast cells of the urh1 gene increases the nucleosidase activity on cytidine (34). URH1p is also involved in the conversion of both endogenous and exogenous nicotinamide ribonucleoside into nicotinamide and contributes to the cellular NAD+ pool (6). A detailed enzymatic characterization of the yeast hydrolase has not yet been reported. We characterized a recombinant form of the S. cereVisiae urh1 gene product. The URH1p protein differs from known group I structures in the quaternary assembly, being found in a 1:3 dimer:monomer ratio by size exclusion chromatography. We performed steady-state kinetic measurements on the purified, recombinant yeast NH. The enzyme is a uridine-preferring CU-NH (kcat ) 117 ( 21 s-1,

KM ) 0.63 ( 0.07 mM, and kcat/KM ) 1.86 × 105 M-1 s-1), with lower specificity toward cytidine (kcat ) 12 ( 1.7 s-1, KM ) 1.02 ( 0.08 mM, and kcat/KM ) 1.18 × 104 M-1 s-1). As predicted from the absence of the Tyr-Tyr-His triad, inosine is indeed not a substrate for URH1p, with a kcat of <0.001 s-1. CONCLUSIONS In summary, in this work we show that the presence of two specific hydroxylated residues is a requirement for purine nucleoside hydrolase activity in members of NH homology group I. These amino acid residues cooperate with the trademark histidine in assembling a catalytic triad that is probably enhancing the process of proton transfer to the purinic moiety. Conversely, the hydrolysis of pyrimidine nucleosides requires primarily the presence of the catalytic histidine and is not affected by the nature of the residues in the R9 helix. This finding demonstrates that the same NH enzyme can plastically adapt to the chemical differences between substrates by using distinct amino acid residues at its active site. Our results provide for the first time a definition of the biochemical basis for the different substrate specificities by IU-NH and CU-NH enzymes.
