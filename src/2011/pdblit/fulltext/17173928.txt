The conditions of extraction of nicotinamide nucleotides from Escherichia coli were systematically investigated. The optimum pH for NAD+ and NADP+ appeared to be around 1.5 while that for NADH and NADPH was around 12.5. Seven minutes at 60°C was chosen for the extraction of all four nucleotides. Addition of CuCl to the alkaline extract improved considerably the recovery of the reduced forms. Two sensitive (10-100 pmol) assay methods for nicotinamide nucleotides were compared. A spectrophotometric cycling method based on the measurement of reduced thiazolyl blue formation appeared to be more sensitive and more reproducible and gave better recovery than a fluorometric cycling method used earlier in bacterial studies.

The assays of nicotinamide nucleotides are of continual interest in the studies of energy transforming and oxidation-reduction reactions. Attempts have been made to estimate the intracellular redox state indirectly by measuring intracellular concentrations of oxidized and reduced pyridine nucleotides (l-3). The results are somewhat conflicting due to the drawbacks of the methods used. As a consequence of the poor sensitivity of the assays of pyridine nucleotide measurements, the cell cultures have been concentrated by centrifuging (1,2). Wimpenny and Firth (3) have shown that this harvesting method drastically alters the amounts of the nucleotides. Therefore, they used a very sensitive recycling method developed by Cartier (4) based on the fluorometric measurement of resorufin formation without harvesting. We observed in the present study, however, that this method is unsatisfactory, especially in NAD(P)H measurements. Therefore, we applied the method of Bernofsky and Swan (5) based on the measurement of reduced thiazolyl blue formation at 570 nm and improved it so that it can be used for pyridine

nucleotide measurements from bacterial sources. The results presented in this paper indicate that this method is both more sensitive and more reproducible, and gives better recovery than the method of Car-tier. The yield of the intracellular nucleotides depends essentially on the conditions of extraction. The conditions presented in the literature are very diverse. Therefore, the present study systematically investigates the effect of pH, temperature, and length of extraction time on the amounts of the four nucleotides NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH from Escherichia coli.

Escherichia coli UY41 (ATCC 11775), a wild-type strain, was used. The glucose mineral salts minimal medium and culture conditions have been described (6). Extraction of pyridine nucleotides. On the basis of experiments described in the results section of this paper, the following method of extraction was used: 2.0 ml of bacterial suspension was rapidly pipetted into either 1.0 ml of 0.3 N HCl to extract NAD+ and NADP+ or 1.0 ml of 0.3 N KOH to extract NADH and NADPH. The alkaline extract was supplemented with 10 mg/ml of CuCl to precipitate interfering thiols. The acid extraction (pH 1.5) destroyed the reduced forms, and the alkaline extraction (pH 12.5) the oxidized forms of pyridine nucleotides. After incubation for 7 min at 60°C the extracts were cooled to 0°C. Under these conditions, the nucleotides remained stable for several days (see Results). Before assaying, the nucleotide extracts were neutralized to pH 7.0 by carefully adding and thoroughly vortexing with either 0.3 N HCl or 0.3 N KOH. The neutralized extracts were kept at 0°C for at least 10 min to precipitate proteins before centrifuging at 3000g for 10 min (NAD+ and NADP+) or at IOOOOg for 15 min (NADH and NADPH). Assays of pyridine nucleotides. The fluorometric cycling assay of Cartier (4) based on the measurement of resorufin formation was performed as described by Wimpenny and Firth (3) using a Perkin-Elmer fluorescence spectrophotometer MPF-2A with a Perkin-Elmer 150 xenon power supply (Norwalk, Conn.) and a Hitachi recorder QPD 33, amplifier, and power unit (Tokyo, Japan). In the spectrophotometric cycling assay of Bernofsky and Swan (5) based on the

measurement of reduced thiazolyl blue formation at 570 nm, the assay mixture for NAD+ and NADH contained the following in 1.4 ml: 180 pmol of triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 7.4), 840 pmol of ethanol, 7 pmol of disodium EDTA, 2.8 pmol of PES, and 0.7 pmol of MTT. NAD+ extract, 30 ~1, or 200 ~1 of NADH extract was added and the reaction was initiated with 100 ~1 (0.13 mg) of alcohol dehydrogenase. The assay mixture for NADP+ and NADPH contained 180 pmol of triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 7.6), 2.8 pmol of glucose-6phosphate, 2.8 pmol of PES, and 0.7 pmol of MTT in 1.4 ml. NADPt or NADPH extract, 100 ~1, was added and the reaction was initiated with 10 ~1 (3.3 pg) of glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase. The reactions proceeded in darkness for 40 min at 37°C and were terminated with 1.0 ml of I2 mM potassium iodoacetate. Control mixtures contained no enzymes. Absorbance measurements were determined with a Beckman Model G 2400 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments, Miinchen, GFR), equipped with a Model 2220 adapter, a Model 244 automatic cuvette positioner, and a Model 222A photometer (Gilford Instrument Lab. Inc., Oberlin, Ohio).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The Pyridine

Nucleotide

Assays

In order to avoid concentrating bacterial cell cultures before assaying the pyridine nucleotides, .one should use a sensitive assay suitable to bacterial samples. Several very sensitive assays based on enzymatitally catalyzed recycling reactions have been introduced recently (4-9). In such reactions the pyridine nucleotide is alternately oxidized by an enzyme, then reduced back again by another enzymic or nonenzymic reaction in a cyclic fashion. After a sufficient number of cycles, one of the products which has accumulated is measured, thus achieving high sensitivity. In the assays of Rasmussen

et al. (7), Kato ef al. (8), and Schulman et al. (9), NAD is reduced in an alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction and reoxidized in another enzymic reaction in which an oxidized substrate is converted to an accumulating reduced product, which is finally measured. In these methods NADP+ and NADPH must be converted to NAD+ or NADH before assaying. On the other hand, in the methods of Cartier (4) and Bernofsky and Swan (5) pyridine nucleotides are reoxidized nonenzymaticahy with PMS or PES, the reduced forms of which in turn convert another substance to an accumulating colored product. Both NADH and NADPH are capable of reducing PMS or PES. Thus, NAD+ and NADH are assayed using alcohol dehydrogenase, and NADP+ and NADPH using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. As far as we know, only the fluorometric assay of Cartier (4) has been used to estimate bacterial pyridine nucleotides (3,lO). We compared this assay and the spectrophotometric assay of Bernofsky and Swan (5) which we improved for bacterial samples. We observed that the latter assay is better in many respects. It is simpler and quicker because in the fluorometric assay successive additions of internal nucleotide standard solution must be made. The sensitivity of the fluorometric assay is poorer. Cat-tier (4) states that the standard curve of NAD is linear from 50 to 300 pmol. However, in order to make it possible to take samples of only l-2 ml from bacterial cell cultures, NAD measurements are preferably carried out in a more sensitive range of concentration. Figure 1 shows that linear response appears only from 20 to 60 pmol of NAD. The assay is based on the measurement of resorufin formation. Resorufin is also formed without the initial enzymic reaction and this obviously causes disturbances in the lower part of the standard curve. In the upper part, the increase in fluorescence levels off due to quenching. On the other hand, the standard curve in the spectrophotometric assay is

linear from 10 to 150 pmol of NAD, as shown in Fig. 1 and even from 1 pmol of NAD if the incubation time is increased as in (5). The reproducibility of the spectrophotometric assay is also better. Wimpenny and Firth (3) reported a 15% error for the NAD assay of Cartier. In our work the percentage of error in the spectrophotometric NAD assay was only 4%.
Extraction of Pyridine Nucleotides from E. Co/i

The conditions of nucleotide extraction presented in the literature are very diverse. Brunker and Brown (2) incubated the cell suspension with 3 N HCIO, to extract NAD+ and NADP+, or with 1 N ethanolic KOH for 10 min at room temperature to extract NADH and NADPH. London and Knight (11) used 0.33 N HCl and 0.33 N NaOH, respectively, and an incubation time of 10 min at 50°C. Wimpenny and Firth (3) used 0.1 N HCl and 3 N KOH. Wright and Sanwell (1) extracted NAD+ by incubating cell suspensions with 0.6 N HClO, for 2 min at room temperature, and NADH with 0.5 N ethanolic KOH for 80 s at 65°C. In the present study we systematically investigated the effect of pH, temperature and length of extraction time on the amounts of pyridine nucleotides. Figure 2 shows the extraction of

NAD+ and NADP+ as a function of pH and the normality of hydrochloric acid. The optimum pH for both nucleotides is around a pH value of 1.5. Thus, 0.3 N HCl, giving a final concentration of 0.1 N when added to the bacterial suspension, was chosen for both NAD+ and NADP+ extraction. Figure 3 shows the extraction of NADH and NADPH as a function of pH and the normality of potassium hydroxide. The optimum pH lies around a pH value of 12.5 for both nucleotides, which are rapidly destroyed in more alkaline conditions. In more acidic conditions the NADH curve rises. This is obviously due to the incomplete destruction of NAD+, which interferes with the assay of NADH. KOH, 0.3 N (final concentration 0.1 N), was chosen for the

As a consequence of these experiments, a temperature of 60°C and a time of 7 min were chosen for the extraction procedure. Stability of Extracted Fyridine Nucleotides It was not always possible to assay the extracted nucleotides immediately. Therefore, we studied the stability of the extracts. After the normal extraction with either acid or alkali, the bacterial samples were kept at 4°C without neutralization. The results, seen in Table 1, indicate that extracted pyridine nucleotides remain quite stable for several days.

Use of CuCl in the Extraction of NAD(P)H

There appears to be a factor which is not destroyed during the alkaline extraction and interferes with both the fluorometric (3) and the spectrophotometric (5) cycling assays. The recovery of NADH standard solution added to the bacterial extract was 20- 140%, depending on the experimental conditions. According to Bernofsky and Swan (S), thiols interfere with the cycling procedure. E. coli has a high content of nonprotein thiols, mainly reduced glutathione (GSH) (12). It is known that in the isolation of GSH from yeast, the addition of a slight excess of cuprous oxide precipitates a crystalline cuprous salt of GSH (12). Therefore, to improve the recovery of NADH we added the sparingly soluble CuCl(l0 mg/ml) to the alkaline extraction. An excess of CuCl is easy to remove from the extraction mixture by centrifuging because of its low solubility. after CuCl treatment, the recovery of NADH was 97%. Bemofsky and Pankow (13) used N-ethylmaleimide to remove the interfering thiols from muscle extracts, but they recovered only 75% of the NADH.

The percentage recoveries were as follows: NAD+, 97; NADH, 97; NADP+, 96; and NADPH, 96. Different bacterial cell concentrations (O.l0.4 mg of dry weight/ml) had no substantial effect on the recoveries. Our extraction and assay procedures gave very good recovery values at a level of approx 2 X lo-l1 moles of nucleotides. By comparison, Wimpenny and Firth (3) observed a loss of about 15% in the recovery of NAD+ and NADH at a level of 2 x lo-* mol. They used lower acid and higher alkali concentrations compared to our extraction procedure.
