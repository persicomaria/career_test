Fitting model 2 (without Cp): Gfolding=G1(T-Tm) * Tmax is the temperature of the maximum folding rate.  f (Tmax) is the activated folding time at Tmax. f (Tmax) = kf (Tmax)-1  K is the equilibrium constant.

Preparation of Pin WW variants. Variants B-1, B-2, C-1, and C-2 were prepared on a 0.1 mmol scale on an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer using the Fmoc/Ot-Bu protecting scheme as previously described (1) with the following modification. Residues from the protein C-terminus to the site of turn mimic incorporation were added onto the resin via the standard automated procedures, and the N-terminus was deprotected. The resin was then removed from the synthesis vessel and the turn mimic (1 or 2) was coupled to the peptide manually. In 1 mL DMF, 1.1-1.2 mmol (1.1-1.2 equiv) of 1 or 2 was combined with 1.05-1.15 mmol (0.95 equiv) HBTU and 0.44-0.48 mmol (4 equiv) diisopropylethylamine and the solution was agitated for three minutes before addition to the resin. The resin was shaken in the DMF mixture for 2 h, then rinsed with DMF and MeOH, dried under vacuum, and returned to the synthesis vessel for automated addition of the remaining N-terminal residues. Synthesized peptides were cleaved from the resin using King's reagent and isolated by precipitation from cold diethyl ether. Variants B-3, C-3, and D-3 were made analogously with the exception that each N-Fmoc nipecotic acid residue was added manually. After the addition of the (R)-residue, the Fmoc group was removed by shaking the resin in 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 minutes followed by several DMF washes. The (S)residue was then added, the resin was washed with DMF and MeOH, then returned to the automated synthesizer for addition of the N-terminal residues. Variants B-4, B-5, C-4, C-5, C-6, D-4, and D-5 were made manually by solid phase peptide synthesis using procedures previously described (2, 3) with the following exceptions. A small excess (1.1-1.2 equiv) of N-BOC-4, -5, or -6 was used. Following the incorporation of 4, 5 or 6, all BOC deprotection steps were carried out using 5% thioanisole in TFA in order to scavenge the t-butyl cation and prevent its reaction with the incorporated alkene. Deprotection of side chains and cleavage of the peptide from the resin was effected by treatment with HF following standard protocols, and crude peptides were isolated by precipitation from cold diethyl ether. All protein variants were purified by reverse-phase HPLC and size exclusion chromatography and identified by ESI-MS as has been described elsewhere (3, 4). Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance of the protein solution at 280 nm using 280 = 8,480 M-1 cm-1. As 2 also absorbs at 280 nm, the extinction coefficient used for B-2 and C-2 was 289 = 24,576 M-1 cm-1. CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded using an AVIV model 202SF spectrometer from 190-260 nm at 1 nm resolution at 2 °C in a quartz cell with 2 mm path length. All Pin WW variants were monitored as a 40 M solution in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The maximum at 227 nm observed for all Pin WW variants is diagnostic of the native Pin WW sheet fold.

Equilibrium unfolding of Pin WW variants. To assess protein stability in the presence of increasing concentrations of GdnHCl, two solutions were prepared. The first contained 10 M of the protein variant in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The second contained 10 M of the protein variant in approximately 8.2 M GdnHCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The protein solution without GdnHCl was placed in a 1 cm path length stirred quartz cell, and the CD signal at 227 nm was averaged over 2 minutes at 2 °C. A calculated volume of solution was withdrawn from the cell, and an equivalent volume of the protein solution in GdnHCl buffer was

11

added such that the [GdnHCl] changed by 0.2-0.3 M, but the protein concentration remained constant. The CD signal at 227 nm was again recorded, and this procedure was repeated until [GdnHCl] = 7 - 8 M. Denaturation of the protein with GdnHCl was also monitored by fluorescence in an analogous fashion with the following modifications. A constant concentration of 5 M protein was used, and the sample was excited at 280 nm and the emission spectra were collected from 319-361 nm at each [GdnHCl]. The emission signal intensity at 341 nm was used to generate the denaturation curves.

Assignment of Proton Resonances of the C-4 variant. Chemically synthesized C-4 was prepared at a final concentration of 466 M in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 90% H2O/10% D2O or in 100% D2O. NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker Avance 500 MHz and Bruker DRX 600 MHz instruments with TXI cryogenic probe and z-axis gradients at 288.15 K. The proton resonances for Pin WW variant C-4 were assigned using standard 2D NMR spectroscopy, including 2QF-COSY (5), NOESY (6) and TOCSY (7). Backbone connectivities in the standard peptide portion of the molecule were assigned in a straightforward manner using COSY/TOCSY and NOESY spectra utilizing primarily the strong dN(i,i+1) cross peaks characteristic of strands. Standard reverse turns could be readily assigned using dNN(i,i+1) cross peaks. Side chains were identified in TOCSY and COSY spectra and the aromatic protons were connected to the backbone using NOESY cross peaks between the H and H, although the positions of many of the aromatic rings close together in sequence and in the 3D structure of the folded protein caused several of these assignments to be ambiguous: the ambiguities were resolved during the AMBER calculations. The assignment of -turn mimic 4 resonances presented some challenges in a proton-only NMR spectrum. The module contains several protons, but these are in several cases unconnected by direct scalar couplings, and since the structure is non-standard from a peptide point of view, NOE connectivities are difficult to use for assignment purposes. The structure of the -turn mimic is shown in Figure S3. In this structure, we expect HN, HA and MB to be connected by scalar couplings, similar to a normal Ala residue, giving cross peaks in COSY and TOCSY spectra. In addition, we should observe cross peaks for HG-HD and HD-ME in these spectra. Connection of the two ends of the molecule through the double bond is achieved by the observation of a long-range coupling between MG and HG. These connectivities are illustrated in Figure S3.

H NMR solution structure of C-4. A family of 20 preliminary solution structures of the C-4 variant were generated from the structure family published for the wild-type Pin1 WW domain (8), by substitution of the wild-type loop 1 coordinates with coordinates corresponding to those of 4, obtained from the X-ray crystal structure (9). The general Amber force field (10) was used for 4, and force-field terms connecting 4 to the polypeptide chain were taken from the ff99SB force field, which was also used for the polypeptide chain itself. Each of the preliminary structures was refined in AMBER (11) with a 20 ps restrained simulated annealing protocol incorporating NOE restraints. Structures were heated to 1000K over 2 ps, held at 1000K for 4ps, and then cooled to 0K in 14 ps. Restraints and final coordinates have been deposited in the PDB under accession number 2kbu. Table S1 contains information about the restraints and final structures.
