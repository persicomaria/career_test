Introduction. As part of a structural genomics program, we are determining structures of proteins from the causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis, a Grampositive spore-forming bacterium. Among our initial candidates for crystallographic analysis are the products of essential genes based on knock-out studies in Bacillus subtilis. The BA3935 gene of B. anthracis (www.tigr.org), annotated as DapA2, encodes a putative protein consisting of 292 amino acid residues with a subunit molecular weight of 31,233 Da. The predicted protein has 60% identity with dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS or DapA) from B. subtilis and 40% amino acid sequence identity to its orthologue in Escherichia coli. dapA is one of only 271 out of the total of 4118 genes in B. subtilis that are indispensable for growth of the organism on standard laboratory media.1 DHDPS catalyses the condensation of aspartate semialdehyde and pyruvate and is the first committed step on the pathway to diaminopimelate and L-lysine in prokaryotes, some fungi, and higher plants (Scheme 1). The product released from the E. coli enzyme has been shown to be 4-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-(2S)-dipicolinic acid (HTDPA) rather than L-2,3-dihydrodipicolinic acid (DHDPA); as the name of the enzyme suggests,2 DHDPA can be formed spontaneously from HTDPA by elimination of water. The steps of aspartate semialdehyde synthesis from aspartate are shared with the biosynthetic pathways leading methionine and threonine. The diaminopimelate/ lysine pathway is thought to be of particular importance in Gram-positive bacteria because diaminopimelate makes up a higher proportion of the dry cell weight than it does in Gram-negative bacteria, a consequence of the thicker cell wall in the former. In Bacilli, the product of the DHDPS reaction is further reduced by dipicolinate synthase to dipicolinate, which makes up 10% of the dry weight of spores. Crystal structures have been determined of DHDPS from E. coli,3 Nicotiana sylvestris,4 and most recently from Thermotoga maritima.5 In this article, we report the crystal structure of DHDPS from B. anthracis (Ba DHDPS), the first structure of a dihydrodipicolinate synthase from a Gram-positive bacterium. The structure of Ba DHDPS was determined by molecu©

lar replacement using the coordinate set for the E. coli orthologue (PDB code 1DHP) as the search model.3 Two structures have been determined to 1.9 and 2.2 Å resolution in different orthorhombic crystal forms. Data collection, refinement, and model-building statistics are summarized in Table I. The structures in the two crystal forms are very similar and unless otherwise stated, the commentary here will refer to the structure refined to higher resolution (1XKY). Each DHDPS subunit [Fig. 1(A)] consists of a ( / )8 barrel with three -helices at the C-terminus of the chain. In both crystal forms, there are four subunits in the asymmetric unit and for all of these chains there is clear electron density for residues Met1 to Arg292. The chains within and between the crystal forms can be closely superimposed with pairwise root mean squared deviations (rms ) in C coordinate positions in the range 0.24 ­ 0.34 Å. Following these superpositions, the largest deviations occur at residues 17­19 in the 1­ 1 loop, 221­230 in the 8 ­ 9 loop, and residues 290 ­292 at the C-terminus. When the BaDHDPS structure is compared with the EcDHDPS structure, the positional rms following least squared superposition of 290 equivalent C atoms is 1.35­1.45 Å. This compares with an rms of 1.45­1.55 Å for comparisons between BaDHDPS and TmDHDPS over 284 equivalent C atoms. The four subunits of the asymmetric unit clearly assemble to form a tetramer [Fig. 1(B)] with approximate 222 symmetry, as observed previously in EcDHDPS3 and TmDHDPS.5 There are two types of subunit interface in the tetramer, those between subunits A and B being essentially equivalent to those between subunits C and D, whereas the A­D interface matches that between subunits

B and C. Approximately 2750 Å2 of accessible surface area is buried in the A­B interface which is formed by segments 3­ 3, 4 ­ 4, 5­ 5, 9 ­ 10 and 10 ­ 11 from each subunit. The A­D interface is formed by helices 6, 7, 9 and segments 7­ 8 and 8 ­ 9 from each subunit. These interfaces are less extensive with an average of 1760 Å2 surface being buried. There are no contacts between subunits A and C or between subunits B and D and there is a large central cavity in the tetramer [Fig. 1(B)]. The mechanism of the EcDHDPS reaction has been studied in detail by X-ray crystallography, NMR, and site-directed mutagenesis.2 Following the binding of pyruvate, a Schiff base is formed by this substrate and the active site lysine161. The second substrate aspartate semialdehyde then binds. This is followed by dehydration and cyclization to form the product, which is released. Tyr133, Thr44, and Tyr107 have been proposed to form a catalytic triad that shuttles protons to and from the active site.6 These residues are conserved in BaDHDPS (Tyr135, Thr46,

and Tyr109) and TmDHDPS (Tyr132, Thr43, and Tyr106) with which a structural comparison has been made in Figure 1(C).5 Other residues implicated in substrate binding and catalysis in EcDHDPS2 are also shown in this figure. It is evident that the active sites of BaDHDPS and TmDHDPS are closely similar. Indeed, the active site residues are fully conserved between TmDHDPS, EcDHDPS, and BaDHDPS with the exception of Asn248 (E. coli enzyme numbering), which is replaced by a serine in the B. anthracis enzyme [Fig. 1(D)]. Thus it is highly probable that the three enzymes have similar mechanisms of action. There are two outliers on the Ramachandran plot of residue dihedral angles for each BaDHDPS monomer. Ile142 lies at the A­B (C­D) interface and its side chain interacts with its equivalent Ile residue in the opposing monomer. In the other sequences represented in Figure 1(D), this residue is substituted by glycine. The other outlier is residue Tyr109, which points toward the active centre of the neighbouring subunit [Fig. 1(C)]. It has been proposed that conformational strain at this putative activesite residue may be associated with catalysis as this residue is a Ramachandran outlier in EcDHDPS and TmDHDPS too.2 A second gene in the B. anthracis chromosome (BA2832, dapA1) is also annotated as a dihydrodipicolinate synthase. DapA1 and DapA2 share 32% sequence identity.

DapA2 is clearly orthologous to DapA of B. subtilis, because the genes for both are encoded on an operon that also contains the genes asd and dapG encoding aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and aspartokinase, respectively.7 The gene encoding DapA1 is on an operon that also encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH). This suggests the possibility that DapA1 is a 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate aldolase (KDG) catalyzing the condensation of pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde, as both KDG and ADH are involved in glucarate metabolism. KDG proteins have sequence similarity to DHDPSs and they share similar tertiary structures, reaction mechanisms and active sites.8 Together with N-acetylneuraminate lyase9 and MosA, a protein implicated in rhizopine biosynthesis10 DHDPS and KDG are members of a structural superfamily of Schiff baseforming aldolases11 that have been the subject of protein engineering studies.12 Materials and Methods. Protein Production and Crystallization. The coding sequence of BA3935 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from B. anthracis genomic DNA using KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) and complementary gene-specific primers to which were appended sequences to facilitate ligation independent cloning (LIC).13 For LIC, the PCR amplification product was treated with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dATP to generate 5 single-stranded overhangs at both ends of the fragment, through the enzyme's combined 3 -5 exonuclease and DNA polymerase activities. Complementary 5 single-stranded overhangs were generated in LIC-adapted pET-28a (pET-YSBLIC; M.J. Fogg, unpublished results) by cleavage with the restriction endonuclease BseRI and treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of dTTP. The vector and PCR products were annealed and used to transform E. coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen) to kanamycin resistance. Colony PCR using T7-promoter and gene-specific oligonucleotide primers, established the presence of a gene insert, whose sequence was then confirmed. The pET-YSBLICdapA2 clone was transformed into E. coli B834 for protein overexpression. A 1-L culture of cells was grown with shaking at 37°C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 30 g/mL kanamycin to an OD600 of 0.6, at which point expression of the B. anthracis full-length protein DHDPS, fused to an amino terminal 6-His tag (MGSSHHHHHH) encoded by pET-YSBLIC, was induced by the addition of isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mM Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole (Buffer A), and lysed by sonication on ice, and the cell-free supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor (DuPont). A 5-mL Hi-Trap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia), previously charged with nickel and equilibrated with Buffer A, was attached to an AKTA Explorer 3D purification system (Amersham Pharmacia). The soluble fraction was applied to the column and washed with 25 mL Buffer A followed by 50 mL of Buffer A containing 70 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with Buffer A contain-

ing 500 mM imidazole and automatically passed to a Superdex G-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 150 mM NaCl, for size exclusion chromatography. Fractions containing DHDPS were identified by SDSPAGE, pooled, and concentrated to 91 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). Automated crystallization screening was carried out in 96-well plates (Greiner) using a Mosquito nanolitre pipetting robot (TTP labtech) and screens from Hampton Research (I, II, and Index), and Clear Strategy Screens (CSSI and CSSII)14 at pH 8.0 and 6.5, using sitting-drop vapor diffusion. Each crystallization drop contained 150 nL of protein solution (diluted to 15mg/mL in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and 150 nL of reservoir solution. The intial crystals appeared from drops set up with a reservoir solution containing 18% (w/v) PEG 5000 MME, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.15 M KSCN. These crystals (Form 1) were improved in hanging drop experiments set up manually and containing 1 L of protein solution (diluted to 16 or 25 mg/mL in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) and 1 L of reservoir solution in 24-well plates. The protein crystallized at both concentrations from a reservoir solution containing 18% (w/v) PEG 5000, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.15 M KSCN. A second crystal form (Form 2) grew from drops set up over a reservoir solution containing 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.2 M sodium formate. Crystals were used directly from the 96-well plate for X-ray diffraction; manual optimization was not necessary. Data Collection. Native diffraction data were collected on a home rotating copper anode source and on beamline PX 14.2 at the Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS). Single crystals were mounted in a rayon loop and transferred to a solution of the crystallization mother liquor supplemented with 30% (w/v) PEG 5000 (for the Form 1 crystal) or 30% (w/v) PEG 3350 (for the Form 2 crystal) and then rapidly cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were recorded on an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. Data were processed and reduced using the HKL2000 software suite (Denzo and Scalepack). Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table I. Structure Solution and Refinement. The structure of DHDPS was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP15 from the CCP4 suite.16 Data in the resolution range 50 ­ 4 Å were used in both rotation and translation calculations. Refinement calculations were performed using REFMAC5,17 interspersed with sessions of manual modelling using COOT.18 Refinement and model statistics are presented in Table I. Data Validation and Deposition. The quality of the final model was scrutinised using PROCHECK and SFCHECK.19 Atomic coordinates for the refined B. anthracis DHDPS models together with experimental structure factors have been deposited as PDB codes 1XKY and 1XK9.
