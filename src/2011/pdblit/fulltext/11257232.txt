Review

Caspases are central components of the machinery responsible for apoptosis. Recent structural and biochemical studies on procaspases, IAPs, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosome have revealed a conserved mechanism of caspase activation and inhibition. This article reviews these latest advances and presents our current understanding of caspase regulation during apoptosis.

Introduction Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a central role in the development and homeostasis of all multicellular organisms (Horvitz, 1999; Jacobson et al., 1997). In humans, both excessive and insufficient apoptosis can lead to severe pathological consequences. Suppression of the apoptotic machinery causes autoimmune diseases and is a hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000; Thompson, 1995). For example, the apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) is frequently inactivated in cancers such as malignant melanoma (Soengas et al., 2001). On the other hand, abnormal upregulation of apoptosis contributes to neurological disorders (Yuan and Yankner, 2000). The critical involvement of a cysteine protease CED-3 in apoptosis was first discovered in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans 8 years ago (Yuan et al., 1993). Since then, compelling evidence has demonstrated that the mechanism of apoptosis is evolutionarily conserved, executed by a family of cysteine proteases that cleave after an Asp residue in their substrates, hence the name caspase (Alnemri et al., 1996). At least 14 distinct mammalian caspases have been identified, with their orthologs present in species ranging from the nematode to the dipteran Drosophila melanogaster and the lepidopteran Spodoptera frugiperda. Although the first mammalian caspase, caspase-1 or ICE (interleukin 1 -converting enzyme), was identified to be an important regulator of inflammatory response, at least 8 of the 14 caspases play important roles during apoptosis (Budihardjo et al., 1999; Earnshaw et al., 1999; Fesik and Shi, 2001; Salvesen and Dixit, 1997; Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998). Caspases involved in apoptosis are generally divided into two categories, the initiator caspases, which include caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10, and the effector caspases,

which include caspase-3, -6, and -7 (Figure 1). An initiator caspase is characterized by an extended N-terminal prodomain ( 90 amino acids) important for its function, whereas an effector caspase contains 20­30 residues in its prodomain sequence. All caspases are produced in cells as catalytically inactive zymogens and must undergo proteolytic activation during apoptosis. The activation of an effector caspase (such as caspase-3 or -7) is performed by an initiator caspase (such as caspase-9) through cleavage at specific internal Asp residues that separate the large and small subunits (Figure 1). The initiator caspases, however, are autoactivated. As the activation of an initiator caspase in cells inevitably triggers a cascade of downstream caspase activation, it is tightly regulated and often requires the assembly of a multicomponent complex under apoptotic conditions. For example, the activation of procaspase-9 is facilitated by Apaf-1 and cytochrome c (Cyt. c) (Li et al., 1997), which form an 1.4 MDa complex dubbed an apoptosome in the presence of dATP or ATP (Rodriguez and Lazebnik, 1999; Saleh et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999). Once activated, the effector caspases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of a broad spectrum of cellular targets, leading ultimately to cell death. The known cellular substrates include structural components (such as actin and nuclear lamin), regulatory proteins (such as DNA-dependent protein kinase), inhibitors of deoxyribonuclease (such as DFF45 or ICAD), and other proapoptotic proteins and caspases. Cleavage of the DFF45 (DNA fragmentation factor 45) leads to removal of its inhibition of DFF40 or CAD (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease), which degrades the chromosomes into nucleosomal fragments during apoptosis (Enari et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1997, 1998). Caspases are specific proteases, recognizing at least four contiguous amino acids, named P4-P3-P2-P1, and cleaving after the C-terminal residue (P1), usually an Asp. Although the P1 residue was thought to be exclusively Asp, recent studies indicate that some caspases can also cleave after Glu (Hawkins et al., 2000; Srinivasula et al., 2001). Interestingly, the preferred P3 position is invariantly Glu for all mammalian caspases examined (Thornberry et al., 1997). Thus the preferred specificity of cleavage for caspases can be described as X-Glu-XAsp. Structural characterization of caspase-1 reveals a homodimeric structure (Walker et al., 1994; Wilson et al., 1994). It is now believed that the functional caspase unit is a homodimer, with each monomer comprising a large (20 kDa) and a small (10 kDa) subunit. Homodimerization is mediated by hydrophobic interactions, with 6 antiparallel strands from each catalytic subunit forming a single contiguous 12-stranded sheet (Figure 2A). Several helices and short strands are located on either side of the central sheet, giving rise to a globular fold. The active sites, formed by four protruding loops from the scaffold, are located at two opposite ends of the sheet (Figure 2A). In addition to caspase-1, structural information is available for caspase-3 (Mittl et al., 1997; Rotonda et al., 1996), caspase-7 (Wei et al., 2000), cas-

Their phylogenetic relationship (left) appears to correlate with their function in apoptosis or inflammation. The initiator and effector caspases are labeled in purple and red, respectively. The position of the first activation cleavage (between the large and small subunits) is highlighted with a large arrow while additional sites of cleavage are represented by medium and small arrows. In contrast to other protease zymogens, removal of the prodomain of a caspase is unnecessary for its catalytic activity. The four surface loops (L1-L4) that shape the catalytic groove are indicated. The catalytic residue Cys is shown as a red line at the beginning of loop L2. This diagram is scaled according to the lengths of caspases and the location of functional segments.

pase-8 (Blanchard et al., 1999; Watt et al., 1999), and more recently, caspase-9 (Renatus et al., 2001). Rather than giving a general review on the structural biology of apoptosis (Fesik, 2000; Shi, 2001), this article focuses on the latest developments and surveys our current understanding of caspase regulation at a molecular level. Conserved Features of the Active Site The substrate-binding groove is shaped by four surrounding loops, named L1, L2, L3, and L4 (Figure 2B). The L1 loop constitutes one side of the groove whereas L4 represents the other side (Figure 2C). Loop L3 and the following hairpin, collectively referred to as L3, are located at the base of the groove. Loop L2, which harbors the catalytic residue Cys, is positioned at one end of the groove with the side chain of Cys pointing along the groove, poised for binding and catalysis. Among these four loops, L1 and L3 exhibit a relatively conserved length as well as composition among all mammalian caspases (Figure 1). In contrast, L2 and L4 are highly divergent. These four loops determine the sequence specificity of the substrates. The binding pockets for the P4-P3-P2-P1 residues of the substrate are named S4-S3-S2-S1 subsites, respectively. Structural studies using covalent peptide inhibitors reveal that these pockets are located mostly between the base (L3) and the two sides (L1 and L4).

All known caspases share a similar conformation at the substrate-binding groove (Figure 2B). The S1 and S3 sites are nearly identical among all caspases whereas the location of the S2 and S4 sites is highly conserved. The P1 residue (Asp) is coordinated by three invariant residues at the S1 site, an Arg from L1, a Gln at the beginning of L2, and an Arg at the end of L3 (Earnshaw et al., 1999). The Arg residue on the L3 loop also coordinates the P3 residue (Glu). The S2 and S4 sites map mainly to the L3 and L4 loops; thus the P2 and P4 residues exhibit greater sequence variation. For example, the L4 loop in caspase-1, -8, or -9 is considerably shorter than that in caspase-3 or -7, resulting in a shallower substrate-binding groove (Figure 2D). This observation is consistent with a bulky hydrophobic residue as the preferred P4 residue for caspase-1, -8, or -9. The conformational similarity at the active site is extended to surrounding structural elements. Most notably, the loops L4 and L2 from one catalytic subunit are stabilized by the N terminus (loop L2 ) of the small subunit of the other catalytic subunit (Figure 2), forming the so-called "loop bundle" (Chai et al., 2001a). Activation Mechanisms of the Effector Procaspases Except procaspase-9, all other procaspase zymogens are inactive and require proteolytic activation. Given the presence of the four active site loops in the zymogen,

The bound peptide inhibitor is shown in pink. The four surface loops that constitute the catalytic groove of one heterodimer are labeled. The apostrophe denotes the other heterodimer. Note that L2 stabilizes the active site of the adjacent heterodimer. (B) The active site conformation of all known caspases is conserved. Of the four loops, L1 and L3 are relatively constant while L2 and L4 exhibit greater variability. The catalytic residue Cys is highlighted in red. (C) Schematic diagram of the substrate-binding groove. L1 and L4 constitute two parallel sides of the groove while L3 serves as the base. L2, harboring the catalytic residue Cys, is positioned at one end of the groove, poised for catalysis. L2 plays a critical role by stabilizing the conformation of the L2 and L4 loops. (D) Conformation of the L4 loop in five known caspase structures. The L4 loop dictates the P4 specificity of the substrate. Short L4 loops (caspase-1, -8, and -9) allow bulkier and hydrophobic residue in the P4 position whereas extended L4 loops (caspase-3 and -7) prefer Asp. Coloring scheme is the same as (B). Figures were prepared using MOLSCRIPT (Klaulis, 1991) and GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).

it was intuitively unclear why this is the case. The recent crystal structure of procaspase-7 (Figure 3A) provides an explanation to this puzzle (Chai et al., 2001a; Riedl et al., 2001a). Compared to the inhibitor-bound caspase-7, the core structural elements of the procaspase-7 zymogen are ° nearly identical, with less than 0.8 A root-mean-square-

deviation for all aligned C atoms. However, three of the four active site loops adopt drastically different conformations. L3, which forms the base of the catalytic groove in the active caspase-7, is unraveled and loosened above the base (Figure 3C). Loop L4, which forms one side of the catalytic groove in the active caspase-7, is located farther away from L3, flattening the active site

pocket. Most importantly, loop L2, which contains the catalytic residue Cys186, is rotated 90 , making this residue inaccessible to solvent. Among the four loops, only L1 retains its active site conformation. These rearrangements in the procaspase-7 zymogen do not allow formation of a substrate-binding groove. In particular, the loop bundle seen in the inhibitor-bound caspases is missing in the procaspase-7 zymogen as the L2 loop is flipped by 180 , existing in a "closed" conformation (Figure 3C). These structural rearrangements explain why the procaspase-7 zymogen does not possess detectable catalytic activity. What makes the active site of the procaspase-7 zymogen so different from that of the inhibitor-bound caspase-7? One essential reason is that the unprocessed nature of the procaspase-7 zymogen locks the L2 loop in the closed conformation and occludes it from forming a loop bundle with the L2 and L4 loops. This inability can only be removed by a proteolytic cleavage after Asp198, which allows L2 to switch to its open conformation as observed in the inhibitor-bound caspase-7. As the interactions that stabilize the loop bundle are generally conserved among caspases, this mechanism is likely to be true for other caspases. In this mechanism, the ability of L2 to move freely in response to inhibitor/substrate binding is a decisive feature. In caspase-7, this ability is acquired through proteolytic cleavage after Asp198. But, because L2 is at the N terminus of the small subunit, inverting the order of primary sequences of the large and small subunits could free L2 and hence constitutively activate caspases. Indeed, this prediction was confirmed for caspase-3 and -6 (Srinivasula et al., 1998b) as well as for the Drosophila caspase drICE (Wang et al., 1999). Why does procaspase-9 exhibit a basal level of activity prior to proteolytic activation (Stennicke et al., 1999)? The answer may lie in the fact that caspase-9 contains an expanded L2 loop, which could allow enough conformational flexibility for the L2 loop to move to its productive conformation without an interdomain cleavage. Mechanisms of Substrate Binding Because the active sites of all inhibitor-bound caspases are highly similar (Figure 2B), it was once thought that the substrate-binding grooves on caspases are preformed. However, in the structure of the free caspase-7 (Chai et al., 2001a), these loops are flexible and quite different from those in the inhibitor-bound caspase-7 (Figure 3B). Surprisingly, despite activation cleavage, the L2' loop in the isolated active caspase-7 still exists in the closed conformation, mimicking the procaspase-7 zymogen (Figure 3C). Consequently, the loop bundle is not properly assembled and the catalytic cleft is not well defined. This unanticipated finding indicates that the isolated active caspase-7 adopts a conformation intermediate between that of the zymogen and that of the inhibitorbound caspase-7. Thus inhibitor/substrate binding triggers a 180 flipping of the L2 loop in the active caspase-7, changing its conformation from a closed to an open form (Figure 3C). Each cycle of substrate binding and catalysis is a process of induced fit, accompanied by the back-and-forth flipping of the L2 loop. This

observation argues that the substrate-bound state is transient and can be trapped by the covalent peptide inhibitors. It remains to be seen whether this mechanism is generally applicable to other caspases. Inhibition of Caspases by IAPs Caspases are regulated by many cellular processes. For example, caspases are subject to transcriptional regulation and posttranslational modification (Earnshaw et al., 1999). In addition, active caspases can be permanently eliminated by the ubiquitination-mediated proteasome degradation pathway (Huang et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2001b). The enzymatic activity of caspases is subject to inhibition by the conserved IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) family of proteins (Deveraux and Reed, 1999; Hay, 2000). The IAPs, originally identified in the genome of baculovirus based on their ability to suppress apoptosis in infected host cells, antagonize cell death by interacting with and inhibiting the enzymatic activity of mature caspases. Eight distinct mammalian IAPs, including XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and ML-IAP/Livin (Ashhab et al., 2001; Kasof and Gomes, 2001; Vucic et al., 2000), have been identified, and they target the initiator caspase, caspase-9, and the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -7 (Deveraux and Reed, 1999). These IAP proteins do not inhibit other caspases, such as caspase-6 or -8. The functional unit in IAPs is the baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR), which contains 80 amino acids folded around a zinc atom. XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 contain three BIR domains each, with the different BIR domains exhibiting distinct functions. In these IAPs, the third BIR domain (BIR3) potently inhibits the activity of processed caspase-9 whereas the linker region between BIR1 and BIR2 selectively targets caspase-3 and -7 (Fesik and Shi, 2001; Shi, 2001). This inhibition is highly specific; for example, BIR3 exhibits no inhibition of caspase-3 even at elevated concentrations whereas the linker region between BIR1 and BIR2 has no impact on caspase9. Mutational analysis revealed that, in the XIAP-linkerBIR2 fragment, substitution of Asp148 or Leu141 to Ala nearly abolished caspase-3 inhibition (Sun et al., 1999). The corresponding BIR domains in XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 are highly conserved in both sequence and function. For example, BIR3 of XIAP is more similar to BIR3 of c-IAP1 or c-IAP2 than to BIR2 or BIR1 of XIAP. In contrast to these IAPs, ML-IAP/Livin, which is highly expressed in melanoma and lymphoma, contains only a single BIR domain but was reported to inhibit both caspase-3 and -9 (Ashhab et al., 2001; Kasof and Gomes, 2001; Vucic et al., 2000). Another single BIRcontaining IAP, survivin, does not inhibit caspase activity in vitro. In contrast to the relatively stable expression levels of other IAPs, expression of survivin oscillates with cell cycle and peaks at the G2/M phase (Li et al., 1998). Survivin appears to play an important role in mitosis (Altieri, 2001; Li et al., 1998). Mechanisms of IAP-Mediated Inhibition of Effector Caspases Recent structural analyses reveal the precise mechanism of IAP-mediated inhibition of caspase-3 and -7 (Chai et al., 2001b; Huang et al., 2001; Riedl et al., 2001b).

Mechanisms of IAP-Mediated Inhibition of Effector Caspases and p35-Mediated Pan-Caspase Inhibition (A) Superposition of the structures of caspase-3 (brown) and -7 (green) together with their bound XIAP fragments colored blue and pink, respectively. The interactions primarily occur between a linker segment N-terminal to the BIR2 domain of XIAP and the active site of caspase-3 or -7 (boxed region). The small red circle on BIR2 marks where the Smac N-terminal tetrapeptide binds and the large red circle indicates a likely second interface with Smac. (B) Close-up view of the active sites of caspase-3 and -7 bound to their respective XIAP fragments. Two hydrophobic residues of XIAP, Leu141 and Val146, make multiple van der Waals interactions with a conserved hydrophobic pocket on caspase-3 or -7. Asp148 of XIAP, occupying the S4 pocket, hydrogen bonds to neighboring residues in caspase-3 or -7. (C) Close-up view of the covalent inhibition of caspase-8 by p35. The thioester intermediate is shown between Asp87 of p35 and Cys360 (active site residue). The N terminus of p35 restricts solvent access to this intermediate.

In the structures, the linker peptide N-terminal to XIAPBIR2 forms highly similar interactions with both caspase-3 and -7 (Figure 4A). Compared to the covalent peptide inhibitors, the linker segment of XIAP occupies the active site of caspases in a reverse orientation, resulting in a blockade of substrate entry (Figure 4B). Asp148 of XIAP, which was shown to be critical for the inhibition of caspase-3, binds the S4 pocket in the same manner as the P4 residue of the covalent peptide inhibitors. In addition, Val146 makes a similar set of van der

Waals contacts to surrounding caspase residues as does the P2 residue. In contrast to the covalent peptide inhibitors, Gly144 is located close to the S1 pocket, within van der Waals contact distance of the catalytic Cys in the caspases. Interestingly, although the linker sequence between BIR1 and BIR2 of XIAP plays a dominant role in inhibiting caspase-3 and -7, this fragment in isolation is insufficient (Chai et al., 2001b; Sun et al., 1999). However, an engineered protein with the linker peptide fused either N-

Molecular Cell 464

or C-terminal to BIR1 was fully able to bind and inhibit caspase-3 while neither BIR1 nor BIR2 in isolation exhibited any effect (Sun et al., 1999). These observations suggest that the linker peptide needs to be presented in a "productive" conformation by a surrounding BIR domain. In support of this hypothesis, the linker peptide fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was able to inhibit caspase-3 and -7 (Chai et al., 2001b; Huang et al., 2001). Nevertheless, the BIR domains also contribute to the inhibition of caspases, as XIAP exhibits about 20fold higher potency than the GST-linker peptide fusion (Chai et al., 2001b; Huang et al., 2001). Consistent with this observation, XIAP-BIR2 also makes direct contacts to caspase-3 in the crystal structure (Riedl et al., 2001b). More importantly, the BIR domains provide a scaffold for Smac/DIABLO binding in order to relieve IAP-mediated inhibition of the effector caspases (see below). Mechanisms of IAP-Mediated Inhibition of Caspase-9 Only processed caspase-9 is subject to inhibition by IAPs. Although both BIR2 and BIR3 of XIAP can inhibit caspase-9, BIR3 displays tighter binding affinity and higher potency. Mutation of Trp310 or Glu314 in BIR3 completely abrogates XIAP-mediated inhibition of caspase-9, while amino acids outside of BIR3 are unnecessary for this inhibition (Sun et al., 2000). In the structure, these two residues are located close to each other, suggesting that this region is involved in binding and inhibiting caspase-9. Indeed, BIR3 of XIAP binds to the N terminus of the small subunit of caspase-9 that becomes exposed after proteolytic processing (Srinivasula et al., 2001). This binding presumably brings BIR3 close to the active site of caspase-9, which may block substrate entry and subsequent catalysis. In support of this hypothesis, when the N-terminal four residues of the caspase-3 small subunit were replaced with those from caspase-9, the resulting protein could be inhibited by BIR3 (Srinivasula et al., 2001). The interaction between the N-terminal four residues of the caspase-9 small subunit and XIAP-BIR3 is necessary but may not be sufficient for the XIAP-mediated inhibition. Mutation of His343 in XIAP-BIR3, which is located in a different area than Trp310 and Glu314, results in a loss of caspase-9 inhibition, suggesting that His343 also makes important contacts to caspase-9 (Sun et al., 2000). Covalent Inhibition of Caspases by p35 IAPs are not the only natural inhibitors to caspases. In contrast to XIAP, which only affects caspase-3, -7, and -9, the baculoviral p35 protein is a pan-caspase inhibitor, and it potently targets most caspases both in vivo and in vitro (Miller, 1999). Caspase inhibition by p35 correlates with the cleavage of its reactive site loop after Asp87, which leads to the translocation of the N terminus of p35 into the active site of caspases (Bump et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 1998). The crystal structure of caspase-8 in complex with p35 reveals that the catalytic residue Cys360 of caspase-8 is covalently linked to the Asp87 of p35 through a thioester bond (Xu et al., 2001). Although a thioester bond is generally susceptible to hydrolysis, this bond is protected by the neighboring N terminus of

p35, which occludes access by water molecules (Figure 4C). Another protein, the serpin CrmA derived from the cowpox virus, can also inhibit several caspases, likely through similar covalent modification. This unique covalent mechanism adds to the complexity of caspase inhibition by natural proteins. It is important to note, however, that an equivalent of p35 in mammals has not been identified. Function of Smac/DIABLO During apoptosis, the IAP-mediated caspase inhibition is removed by a mitochondrial protein named Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) (Du et al., 2000) or DIABLO (direct IAP-binding protein with low pI) (Verhagen et al., 2000). Upon stimulation of apoptosis, Smac/DIABLO is released from the intermembrane space of mitochondria into the cytosol, together with Cyt. c. Whereas Cyt. c directly activates Apaf-1 and caspase-9, Smac/DIABLO interacts with multiple IAPs and removes IAP-mediated inhibition of both initiator and effector caspases (Chai et al., 2000; Srinivasula et al., 2000). Smac functions as an elongated dimer, spanning over ° 130 A in length (Chai et al., 2000) (Figure 5A). The wildtype Smac protein binds to both the BIR2 and the BIR3 domains of XIAP but not the BIR1 domain. In contrast, the monomeric Smac mutants interact strongly with BIR3 but do not form a stable complex with BIR2 (Chai et al., 2000). Because the linker sequence immediately preceding BIR2 is involved in binding and inhibiting caspase-3, Smac monomers cannot relieve the IAP-mediated caspase-3 inhibition. Despite the ability to interact with BIR3, the monomeric Smac mutants are less able to relieve IAP-mediated caspase-9 inhibition (Chai et al., 2000). The N-terminal mitochondria-targeting sequence of Smac is proteolytically removed upon import (Du et al., 2000). These freshly exposed N-terminal residues play an indispensable role in Smac function; a seven residue peptide including these residues can remove the XIAPmediated caspase-9 inhibition. Strikingly, a missense mutation of the N-terminal residue Ala to Met in Smac leads to a complete loss of interactions with XIAP and the concomitant loss of Smac function (Chai et al., 2000). A Tetrapeptide IAP-Binding Motif The molecular explanation for the indispensable role of the Smac N-terminal sequences is provided by structures of XIAP-BIR3 bound to either a monomeric Smac protein (Wu et al., 2000) or a nine residue Smac peptide (Liu et al., 2000). The Smac N-terminal tetrapeptide (AlaVal-Pro-Ile) recognizes an acidic surface groove on BIR3, with the first residue Ala binding a hydrophobic pocket and making hydrogen bonds to neighboring XIAP residues (Figure 5B). The next three residues also interact with surrounding hydrophobic residues in BIR3. To accommodate these interactions, the N terminus of Smac must be free, thus explaining why only the mature Smac can bind to the IAPs. Modeling studies indicate that replacement of Ala by a bulkier residue will cause steric hindrance while Gly substitution may result in an entropic penalty as well as loss of binding in the hydrophobic pocket. This analysis explains why mutation

of Ala to Met or Gly abrogated interactions with the BIR domains. Since most of the important interface residues of BIR3 are conserved in BIR2, the isolated N-terminal Smac peptides can also interact with the BIR2 domain of XIAP, though with a lower binding affinity (Liu et al., 2000). In fruit flies, the anti-death IAP, DIAP1, binds and inhibits several Drosophila caspases (Hay, 2000). This function is countered by the proapoptotic proteins, Reaper, Grim, Hid, and more recently, Sickle (Christich et al., 2002; Srinivasula et al., 2002; Wing et al., 2002), which physically interact with the BIR2 domain of DIAP1 and remove its inhibitory effect on caspases. Thus Reaper, Grim, Hid, and Sickle are functional homologs of the mammalian protein Smac/DIABLO. Supporting this notion, the N-terminal tetrapeptides of Reaper, Grim, Hid, and Sickle closely resemble that of the Smac/ DIABLO (Figure 5C). The Smac-binding surface groove on XIAP-BIR3 comprises highly conserved residues among the BIR3 domains of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 and the BIR2 domain of DIAP1, suggesting a conserved mode of interactions. Indeed, the crystal structures of DIAP1BIR2 by itself and in complex with the N-terminal pep-

tides from Grim, Hid, and Sickle reveal that the binding of these N-terminal tetrapeptides precisely match that of the Smac-XIAP interactions (Srinivasula et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2001) (Figure 5D). For Grim and Hid, the next three conserved residues also contribute to DIAP1 binding through hydrophobic interactions. Using a direct XIAP-binding assay, another mammalian protein, HtrA2/Omi, was recently identified by five independent groups (Hedge et al., 2002; Martin et al., 2002; Suzuki et al., 2001a; van Loo et al., 2002; Verhagen et al., 2002). Similar to Smac, HtrA2/Omi is believed to be a resident protein of the intermembrane space of mitochondria and is released to the cytosol during apoptosis. The mature form of HtrA2/Omi contains three functional segments, an IAP-binding tetrapeptide motif at its N terminus, a central serine protease domain, and a PDZ domain at its C terminus. Interestingly, the catalytic activity of the serine protease domain is absolutely essential to the HtrA2/Omi-mediated cell killing activity whereas the N-terminal IAP-binding motif appears less critical. HtrA2/Omi is unlikely to induce cell death through a nonspecific protease activity as it appears to exhibit stringent substrate specificity (Gray et al., 2000).

Figure 6. Schematic Diagram of the Mechanisms of Caspase Activation and Inhibition (Left box) The tetrapeptide motif (red arrows), present in the N termini of Smac and the small subunit of caspase-9, binds to a surface groove on the BIR domains of IAPs (XIAP, c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and Livin/ML-IAP). This motif is responsible for both caspase-9 inhibition through binding BIR3 and the relief of inhibition through displacement of the caspase-9 tetrapeptide with a Smac tetrapeptide. Positive feedback cleavage by caspase-3 or -7 permanently removes IAP-mediated inhibition of caspase-9. The released caspase-9 linker peptide can antagonize IAPmediated inhibition of other caspases. (Right box) On the other hand, a linker segment N-terminal to the BIR2 domain of XIAP is primarily responsible for caspase-3 inhibition. Smac binding to the BIR2 domain may make this linker segment unavailable for binding to caspase-3. For clarity, only BIR domains but not the fulllength IAPs are shown in this figure.

Since PDZ domains typically interact with the C-terminal hydrophobic residues of membrane receptors and ion channels (Harris and Lim, 2001), the PDZ domain in HtrA2/Omi may further regulate its protease activity. The precise mechanism of HtrA2/Omi-mediated apoptosis remains elusive. Removal of Caspase Inhibition by Smac/DIABLO During apoptosis, Smac/DIABLO reactivates the processed initiator as well as effector caspases through distinct mechanisms, although both require physical interactions with IAPs. The N terminus (Ala-Thr-Pro-Phe) of the small subunit of caspase-9 was found to contain an IAP-binding tetrapeptide motif (Srinivasula et al., 2001). Subsequent experiments confirmed that this sequence is indeed primarily responsible for the interactions between the processed caspase-9 and XIAP (Srinivasula et al., 2001). In the absence of proteolytic processing, procaspase-9 is unable to interact with IAPs. Proteolytic processing of procaspase-9 at Asp315 leads to the exposure of an internal tetrapeptide motif, which recruits IAPs to inhibit caspase-9 (Figure 6). The mature Smac binds IAPs, again using a similar N-terminal tetrapeptide. Thus, a conserved IAP-binding motif in caspase-9 and Smac mediates opposing effects on caspase activity (Figure 6).

During apoptosis, caspase-9 can be further cleaved after Asp330 by downstream caspases such as caspase-3 (Figure 6). This positive feedback not only permanently removes XIAP-mediated caspase-9 inhibition but also releases a 15 residue peptide that is able to relieve IAP-mediated inhibition of other caspases. This mechanism ensures that less than a stoichiometric amount of Smac can remove the IAP-mediated caspase-9 inhibition as transient activation of caspase-9 may lead to the activation of caspase-3 and ensuing positive feedback. Although the Smac tetrapeptide in isolation can remove IAP-mediated caspase-9 inhibition, it plays a less direct role in the removal of IAP-mediated inhibition of effector caspases (Figure 6). The binding site for this tetrapeptide motif maps to the surface of BIR2 or BIR3, whereas the fragment responsible for inhibiting caspase-3 or -7 is located between BIR1 and BIR2 of XIAP. Although a conclusive mechanism remains elusive, modeling studies of a Smac/BIR2/caspase-3 complex suggest that steric clashes preclude XIAP-BIR2 from simultaneously binding to caspase-3 and Smac (Chai et al., 2001b). In this model, binding to the BIR2 domain requires not only the N-terminal tetrapeptide of Smac but also an extensive surface available only in the wildtype dimeric Smac protein. This model is consistent with the observation that monomeric Smac mutants only

weakly interacted with BIR2 and were unable to remove the IAP-mediated caspase-3 inhibition (Chai et al., 2000).

Induced Proximity Model for the Initiator Procaspases The initiator caspases invariably contain one of two protein-protein interaction motifs, the CARD (caspase recruitment domain) or the DED (death effector domain). These motifs interact with similar motifs present on oligomerized adapter proteins, thus bringing multiple initiator caspase molecules into close proximity with one another and presumably facilitating their autoactivation. This hypothesis is summarized as the induced-proximity model (Salvesen and Dixit, 1999). For example, procaspase-8 contains two copies of the DED, which interact with the DED of the adapter protein FADD (Fas-associated death domain). FADD, in turn, is a component of the multimeric death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) at the cell membrane (Ashkenazi and Dixit, 1998). Through association with FADD, procaspase-8 is brought into the DISC, resulting in its autocleavage and activation. Another well-characterized paradigm involves procaspase-9 activation. During apoptosis, Cyt. c is released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, where it binds to Apaf-1 and, in the presence of dATP or ATP, assembles into a complex called the apoptosome (Saleh et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999). The primary function of the apoptosome is to recruit procaspase-9 through a CARD-CARD interaction between caspase-9 and Apaf-1 and facilitate autoactivation of caspase-9. Interestingly, Apaf-1 is a member of a conserved family of adaptor proteins that contain an N-terminal CARD, a central nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), and a C-terminal sensing domain for intracellular ligands (Inohara and Nunez, 2001). Members of the NOD family also include Ipaf (Poyet et al., 2001), Nod1 (Inohara et al., 1999), and Nod2 (Ogura et al., 2001). The caspase-activating mechanisms by these NODs are likely to be conserved as well. Interestingly, the NOD proteins in animals

closely resemble a large family of disease-resistant genes in plants (Dangl and Jones, 2001). The induced proximity model appears to be consistent with a number of observations. For example, bacterially expressed caspases are almost always processed to their mature forms, presumably due to high local concentrations. In mammalian cells, forced oligomerization of procaspase-8 through the use of FKBP (FK506 binding protein) and FK1012 (a dimeric form of FK506) led to activation of procaspase-8 and subsequent apoptosis (Muzio et al., 1998; Yang et al., 1998a). Similar results were reported for the mammalian caspase-9 (Srinivasula et al., 1998a) and the C. elegans CED3 (Yang et al., 1998b). Although induced proximity undoubtedly leads to caspase activation, it remains unclear whether this is indeed how the initiator caspases are activated under physiological conditions. For example, effector caspases can also be autoactivated through induced proximity; yet in vivo they are activated by the initiator caspases. In addition, unprocessed procaspase-9 is nearly as active as mature caspase-9 (Srinivasula et al., 2001) and the primary function of the apoptosome is to allosterically enhance caspase-9 activity rather than to facilitate its autoactivation (Rodriguez and Lazebnik, 1999). Furthermore, forced oligomerization of the initiator caspases may not recapitulate the physiological context, in terms of protein expression levels, and more importantly, the specific protein-protein interactions that are required for the precise positioning and activation of the initiator caspases.

Caspase-9 and the Apoptosome It was a rather startling discovery that the processed caspase-9 is only marginally active in the absence of the apoptosome, prompting the concept of a holo-enzyme (Rodriguez and Lazebnik, 1999). Through association with the apoptosome, the catalytic activity of caspase-9

Molecular Cell 468

is enhanced more than 1000-fold (Rodriguez and Lazebnik, 1999). Surprisingly, the unprocessed caspase-9 can be similarly maintained in this "hyperactive" state, demonstrating that the proteolytic processing is unnecessary for the activation of procaspase-9 (Srinivasula et al., 2001). The primary component of the apoptosome, Apaf-1, comprises an N-terminal CARD domain, a CED4 homology domain, and 13 repeats of WD40 at its C-terminal half. The three-dimensional structure of the apoptosome ° at 27 A resolution reveals a wheel-shaped heptameric complex, with the CARD domains of Apaf-1 located at the central hub and the WD40 repeats at the extended spokes (Acehan et al., 2002) (Figure 7A). Docking of caspase-9 to this apoptosome resulted in a domeshaped structure in the center; however, the bulk of the caspase-9 was not visible in these EM studies. Although the concept of apoptosome had been biochemically established, the visualization of the apoptosome allows the identification of the relevant components and proves the structural involvement of Cyt. c in this functional assembly. This structure should also remove remaining doubts about the integrity of the apoptosome as a single structural entity. Nevertheless, because of the low resolution, the identified domain organization remains to be validated. Although most other caspases exist exclusively as homodimers in solution, under physiological conditions, caspase-9 was found to exist in an equilibrium between predominantly monomers and a small amount of dimers (Renatus et al., 2001). Fractions corresponding to dimers and monomers from gel filtration were separately analyzed for their catalytic activity, and only the dimer fractions were found to be active. Interestingly, biochemical as well as structural analyses revealed that dimerization resulted in the formation of only one functional active site (Renatus et al., 2001) (Figure 7B). Based on these observations, it was proposed that dimer formation may drive the activation of caspase-9. While these studies provide solid leads on the mechanisms of caspase-9 activation, they also raise many questions. For example, why didn't the diluted dimers dissociate into the inactive monomers after gel filtration? And why couldn't the far more concentrated monomers form active dimers? It also remains to be seen how the extremely hydrophobic dimerization interface is shielded from solvent in monomeric caspase-9. Based on structural information on caspase-9 and the apoptosome, a model was proposed to explain the activation of procaspase-9 (Acehan et al., 2002) (Figure 7C). In this model, a heptameric apoptosome binds seven monomers of inactive caspase-9. The high local concentrations of caspase-9 within this apoptosome drive the efficient recruitment of additional inactive caspase-9 monomers, which become activated upon binding. This interesting model contains a strong assumption that caspase-9 activity in the dimers is identical to that in the apoptosome holoenzyme, which remains to be experimentally examined. Future Perspectives Recent investigation on caspase regulation has led to a significantly improved understanding of the activation

of procaspase zymogen, the mechanisms of IAP-mediated caspase inhibition, and the Smac-mediated removal of caspase inhibition by IAPs. The identification of a conserved tetrapeptide IAP-binding motif helps unify mechanisms of apoptosis regulation from fruit flies to mammals. Despite these advances, many important questions remain unanswered. Our understanding of how the initiator caspases are activated is far from complete. Although the functions of the BIR2 and BIR3 domains are well understood in XIAP, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, it is unclear what role BIR1 plays in apoptosis and how the different BIR domains cooperate in the full-length IAP to regulate cell death. In addition, it remains to be examined whether the principles derived from mammalian caspases are generally applicable to other species in which no structural information is yet available. Future structural and biochemical studies should clarify these issues. Furthermore, several of the known caspases function primarily in the inflammatory response rather than in programmed cell death. Thus, activation of a caspase cascade does not always lead to apoptosis. Elucidation of the pathways involving these caspases will reveal important insights into how different caspases regulate distinct biological processes.
