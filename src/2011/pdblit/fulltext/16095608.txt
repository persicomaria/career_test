Camel single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) are promising tools in numerous biotechnological and medical applications. However, some conditions under which antibodies are used are so demanding that they can be met by only the most robust VHHs. A universal framework offering the required properties for use in various applications (e.g. as intrabody, as probe in biosensors or on micro-arrays) is highly valuable and might be further implemented when employment of VHHs in human therapy is envisaged. We identified the VHH framework of cAbBCII10 as a potential candidate, useful for the exchange of antigen specificities by complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting. Due to the large number of CDRH loop structures present on VHHs, this grafting technique was expected to be rather unpredictable. Nonetheless, the plasticity of the cAbBCII10 framework allows successful transfer of antigen specificity from donor VHHs onto its scaffold. The cAbBCII10 was chosen essentially for its high level of stability (47 kJ molK1), good expression level (5 mg lK1 in E. coli) and its ability to be functional in the absence of the conserved disulfide bond. All five chimeras generated by grafting CDR-Hs, from donor VHHs belonging to subfamily 2 that encompass 75% of all antigen-specific VHHs, on the framework of cAbBCII10 were functional and generally had an increased thermodynamic stability. The grafting of CDR-H loops from VHHs belonging to other subfamilies resulted in chimeras of reduced antigen-binding capacity.

Introduction
It is over a decade ago that functional antibodies, composed of heavy chains only, were discovered in the serum of old world and new world camelids.1

Immediately after the discovery of these heavy chain antibodies, a method was designed to clone and select by phage display their antigen-binding domain, referred to as VHH or nanobodye, against any kind of antigen from the heavy chain antibodies of an immunized camelid.2­4 During the last couple of years, the potential of VHHs as an attractive alternative to antigen-binding fragments from conventional antibodies, such as Fabs and scFvs in biotechnological, diagnostic and therapeutic applications has been demonstrated.5­10 Especially, the small size and strict monomeric behavior of the VHHs are at the origin of their outstanding performance.2­10 Moreover, their unique ability to target alternative epitopes compared to conventional

598 antibodies offers additional opportunities.10 However, a number of applications require the use of antibodies or antibody fragments that remain functional after exposure to harsh conditions such as low pH of the stomach or during regeneration of biosensors. There is a growing interest in antibody fragments that preserve their antigen-binding capacity in the reducing environment inside cells. All variable domains, including VHHs, have a conserved disulfide bond between the b-sheets, and therefore their intracellular expression is unpredictable,11 hampering their use as intrabodies. Finally, for other applications like immunofluorescence or micro-array detection, it would be far better if all VHHs directed against a wide variety of antigens possess an identical scaffold, as this would allow the standardization of protocols of probe labeling or chip-immobilization, etc.12 A synthetic library made by the randomization of the codons encoding the loops of a unique, stable scaffold could certainly serve to retrieve binders against a wide variety of possible antigens. Although such libraries based on lipocalins, protein A, scFv, and ankyrins scaffolds have been reported,13­18 in our hands, synthetic libraries on VHH scaffolds failed to yield consistently good affinity binders after panning. The antigen specificity seemed to be reasonable, but the affinity was most often insufficient to detect low concentrations of analyte, and tedious procedures should be introduced to improve the affinity, mostly involving the creation of a new library by randomizing codons in the periphery of the paratope, and reselection. This approach is timeconsuming and it might be faster to first immunize a camelid, whereby the immune system of the host will perform the affinity maturation over a period of

two months, and to construct subsequently an immune library of all the VHHs. Several groups, including ours, have reported the successful isolation of high-affinity binders based on camelid single domain antibody fragments from immune libraries.8­10,19,20 In this approach, the antigenbinding loops need to be grafted onto a universal, stable scaffold to obtain a standardized format for labeling, immobilizations, etc. Such a grafting approach has been used successfully for conventional antibody fragments.21­23 However, from crystallographic data we know that the antigenbinding loops of VHHs do not obey the canonical loop structure rules proposed for human/mouse VHs.24 Moreover, the key elements preserving loop architecture remain to be determined. Some of them might be hidden in the framework regions, and would not be included during the grafting experiment. For example, it is well established that in most VHHs, part of the CDR-H3 loop folds over the framework-2 region and, although all VHHs belong to the same family (equivalent of human VH-III), variations in this region do occur and might influence the CDR-H loop conformation. The loop grafting strategy for VHHs might therefore be far from evident. Over the last eight years we have generated and characterized more than a hundred VHHs directed against various antigens and possessing a wide range of physico-chemical properties. Such a large VHH collection allows us to generate multiple chimeras by exchanging the CDR-Hs on different frameworks, and to deduce the general principles for successful grafting. In this work, clear evidence is provided that the framework of a VHH, cAbBCII10, is a good candidate to produce chimeras with antigen-binding parameters

599 The amino acid sequences of their framework regions differ by only four amino acid residues, whereas major differences in CDR-H sequence and length occur (Figure 1(a)). In addition, cAbCA05 contains an interloop disulfide bond between CDRH1 and CDR-H3 that is absent from cAbHuL6. Chimeras were constructed via PCR using primers containing the complete CDR-H sequences. To distinguish the various chimeras, a single-letter code was assigned corresponding to the CDR-H loops of the donor VHH. As such, cAbCA05-H-H-H consists of the scaffold of cAbCA05 harboring the three CDR-H loops of cAbHuL6 and, likewise, cAbHuL6-C-C-C consists of the scaffold of cAbHuL6 encompassing the CDR-H loops of cAbCA05. The chimeras were cloned into the same expression vector as the original VHH, having a His6-tag for purification,9 and were well expressed in the periplasm of Escherichia coli, at levels comparable to those of the parental counterparts (Figure 2(a)). Additionally, the effect of the amino acid residue at position 103 on loop grafting was investigated. Normally, this position is occupied by a Trp and its side-chain participates in the CDR-H3 loop organization. Due to a somatic mutation, this residue is substituted by Arg in cAbCA05. Therefore, two chimeras on cAbCA05 were constructed, both harboring the three CDR-Hs of cAbHuL6 with either Arg or Trp at position 103 to assess the effect of this framework mutation abutting the CDR-H3 loop. cAbCA05-H-H-H (Trp103) and cAbHuL6-CC-C are specific for human lysozyme and carbonic anhydrase, respectively; and no cross-reactivity on the antigen from the original recipient framework was observed (Table 1). The cAbCA05-H-H-H (Trp103) exhibits an affinity similar to that of cAbHuL6. Remarkably, the cAbHuL6-C-C-C revealed a tenfold drop in affinity compared to cAbCA05. Possibly, the Arg103 in cAbCA05 allows more extensive interaction of the CDR-H3 with the framework. Both Arg103 and the interloop disulfide bond in cAbCA05 allow the CDR-H3 to occupy the correct position for antigen binding, and this cannot be maintained in presence of Trp103 in cAbHuL6-CC-C. A complete loss of specificity for human lysozyme for cAbCA05-H-H-H (Arg103) was observed. This clearly shows that residue 103, although belonging to framework-4, is critical for proper positioning of the third antigen-binding loop of cAbHuL6. Although the CDR-H3 loop of both VHHs folds over the former VL side,25,26 their positioning is different in the parental VHHs

approaching those of the original CDR-H donor VHH. Moreover, these chimeras are often better expressed and of greater stability than the original VHH. Additionally, they are functional in the absence of the conserved disulfide bond of the immunoglobulin fold or under reducing conditions, a prerequisite for intrabody applications.

Results
Exchange of CDR-Hs between homologous VHH scaffolds To test the feasibility of loop grafting, we first chose two VHHs having nearly identical frameworks but exhibiting major sequence differences among their CDR-Hs. These VHHs are cAbHuL6 and cAbCA05, which specifically recognize human lysozyme25 and carbonic anhydrase,26 respectively.

positions within the scaffold might seriously limit the success rate of transferring the antigen specificity by exchange of loops even among homologous frameworks. Search for a universal VHH framework A generic VHH framework should be a robust scaffold that accepts a large variety of CDR-Hs with preservation of the donor antigen specificity and affinity. Ideally, the chimeric construct should lead to an enhanced expression level of low-producing VHHs, and to an increased stability of rather unstable VHHs. To identify such a generic VHH scaffold, we focused on VHHs having good expression yields, of high in vitro stability, and able to fold and recognize the antigen under reducing conditions. cAbTEM2, described by Conrath et al.,9 with a DG8 value of 55(G3) kJ molK1, being the VHH of greatest stability reported so far,27 is unfortunately expressed at low yield in E. coli and was consequently excluded from further study. Other possible generic scaffold candidates are cAbBCII10, 9 cAbHuL6, 25 and cAbPSA11 with DG8 values of 47(G2) kJ molK1, 43(G3) kJ molK1 and 37(G3) kJ molK1 respectively (Table 2; Figure 4), and all exhibiting good levels of production in bacteria (5 mg l K1, 6 mg lK1 and 5 mg l K1 , respectively, Figure 2(a) and (b)). Subsequently, we investigated the possibility to remove the conserved disulfide bond by replacing the conserved cysteine residues. Substitutions of Cys22 to Ala and Cys92 to Val should not perturb the structure,28 and were therefore introduced into several VHHs. In the case of cAbHuL6 and cAbPSA11, the introduction of these substitutions yielded functionally impaired entities. Although cAbHuL6 Cys22Ala/Cys92Val still binds its antigen with comparable affinity, it is prone to

(Figure 3). The bulky side-chain of Trp103 presents the CDR-H3 of cAbHuL6 in a proper conformation for antigen binding, whereas this loop conformation is probably modified upon the Trp103Arg substitution. These data demonstrate the feasibility to exchange CDR-Hs of various length and structure between two VHHs with a high degree of identity in their frameworks. However, they also illustrate how the nature of particular amino acids at key

The expression level is defined as the typical amount of VHH protein recovered after purification (in mg) per liter of E. coli cultured. The values of free energy change (DG8 in kJ molK1) upon unfolding are obtained from the analysis of the equilibrium transitions. The antigen specificity of each VHH is determined by solid-phase ELISA. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated as the ratio koff/ kon obtained from biosensor measurements, and is given in nM. ND, not determined; NBD, no binding detected.

601 (HEWL), bovine ribonuclease, respectively (Table 2; Figure 1(b)). The expression yield of all chimeras is comparable to, or higher than, the level of the parental CDR-H donor VHH (Figure 2(b)). The increase in yield was particularly remarkable for the cAbBCII10-N-N-N, which was retrieved at 2.5 mg lK1, compared to the marginal expression for cAbPSAN7 (!200 mg lK1). This demonstrates the possibility to drastically improve the yield of low-expressing VHHs by loop grafting onto our universal VHH framework. However, the expression yield is less important than antigen recognition. In the case of cAbBCII10N-N-N, an equilibrium dissociation constant similar to that of cAbPSA-N7 was measured for prostate-specific antigen, with KD values of 0.6 nM and 0.16 nM, respectively (Figure 5(a)). In general,

aggregation, even at low concentrations. Moreover, upon guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced unfolding, the m-value of the cystine-free cAbHuL6 displayed considerable deviation compared to other constructs. Hence, no DG8 was derived. The cAbPSA11 variant with Cys22Ala/Cys92Val mutations, expresses at 50 mg lK1 compared to 5 mg lK1 for cAbPSA11, suggesting its improper folding, probably due to a low intrinsic stability. In contrast, removal of the conserved disulfide bond from cAbBCII10 generates a functional VHH with DG8 of 35(G3) kJ molK1 (Figure 4), still able to bind to its antigen with an equivalent affinity. These results show that cAbBCII10 is the only framework with all the criteria selected as prerequisite for a generic scaffold (i.e. high expression yield, high level of stability even in the absence of the conserved disulfide bond). Therefore, the cAbBCII10 scaffold was chosen for further analysis. The cAbBCII10 framework as universal loop acceptor To demonstrate the generic character of the framework of cAbBCII10, we selected a range of donor VHHs that have affinity for their antigen in the nanomolar range, but that differ in expression level, in length and structure of their CDR-Hs (especially that of CDR-H3) and in conformational stability. The three CDR-Hs of the selected VHHs were grafted onto the framework of cAbBCII10. Chimeras are referred to as cAbBCII10-X-X-X, with X being H, P, N, L and R to denote the antigen specificity of the loop donor VHH: Human lysozyme, PSA, PSA-N7, hen egg-white lysozyme

602 only minor differences, mostly slight increases, were observed when comparing the equilibrium dissociation constants of each chimera and the original VHH for their cognate antigen (e.g. KD of 5.4 nM for cAbBCII10-P-P-P versus 4.5 nM for cAbPSA11; Figure 5(a)). The observed decrease in affinity of the chimera compared to the original VHH is typically caused by a combination of a decreased kinetic on-rate and an increased kinetic off-rate. The slight decrease in affinity for the chimeras suggests that the antigen-binding loops might adopt alternative conformations when present on cAbBCII10. The large variability in CDR-H length, possible presence of interloop disulfide bonds and loop contacts with framework residues, might impose alternative CDR-H positioning when present on a different scaffold. This was demonstrated for the crystal structure of the cAbBCII10-L-L-L in complex with HEWL. Obviously, some loop reshaping might alter the binding interactions between antigen and chimera compared to wild-type VHH; however, the cAbBCII10 scaffold seems to accommodate various loops, as seen from the comparison of the CDR-H loops of cAbBCII10-L-L-L with those of the donor cAbLys3 (Figure 6). The interactions in cAbBCII10-L-L-L of the three antigen-binding loops with HEWL are similar to those present between cAbLys3 and HEWL. The CDR-H3 loop of cAbBCII10-L-L-L, which is dominant in antigen binding, adopts a configuration identical with that of the CDR-H3 of cAbLys3. There are minor distortions in the N-terminal part of the CDR-H1 loop of cAbBCII10-L-L-L, caused by the H4 loop (residues 72­76) which structurally differs from that in cAbLys3. The observed decrease in antigen affinity is probably caused indirectly by the small structural changes. The peptide backbone of both cAbBCII10-L-L-L and cAbLys3 superimpose nicely onto each other. Next to the antigen affinity and specificity, the conformational stability of all chimeras was measured and compared to their original counter-

parts. Upon GdmCl-induced unfolding, the denaturation of all cAbBCII10 chimeras could be described according to a cooperative two-state model, as observed for all VHHs studied so far.27,29 The effect of loop exchange on the stability is, in most cases, in favor of the chimera with increased DG8 values compared to that of the loop donor (Figure 5(b)). For cAbBCII10-P-P-P, cAbBCII10-HH-H, cAbBCII10-L-L-L and cAbBCII10-N-N-N, an increase in stability of 6 kJ molK1, 7 kJ molK1, 14 kJ mol K1 and 18 kJ mol K1, respectively, is observed, although their DG8 values remain below the value of wild-type cAbBCII10. Only in the case of cAbBCII10-R-R-R, a conformational stability (i.e. with DG8Z20(G2.7) kJ molK1) lower than the original VHH, cAbRN0525 (DG8Z31.7 kJ molK1) is observed. Limitations of loop grafting on the generic VHH framework Importance to graft all three CDR loops In the previous experiments, all CDR-H loops were transferred onto cAbBCII10, even though the crystal structures reveal that cAbRN05 interaction with bovine RNase is mediated largely by CDR-H3 contacts,30 and cAbLys3 to HEWL recognition involves mainly CDR-H1/CDR-H3 residues.31 Therefore, it could be argued that the CDR-H3 grafting might be sufficient for antigen specificity exchange. For example, one might expect that chimeras possessing the CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 of cAbLys3 (Figure 1(d)) would still recognize HEWL. Comparable expression levels (around 5 mg lK1) were obtained for cAbBCII10 and cAbBCII10-L-L-L (Figure 2(b)) while a lower expression level of 2.5 mg lK1 was observed for cAbBCII10-L-B-L (Figure 2(c)). Equilibrium dissociation constants of 2500 nM and 7.6 nM were calculated for cAbBCII10-L-B-L and cAbLys3, respectively, on covalently coupled HEWL. This drop in affinity of cAbBCII10-L-B-L

603 caused by a 500-fold increase of the kinetic off-rate constant combined with a threefold decrease of kinetic on-rate. Stability measurements showed cAbBCII10-G-G-G to be hardly more stable than the original cAbGFP4 (i.e. DG8Z35(G5) kJ molK1 and 30(G2) kJ molK1 for cAbBCII10-G-G-G and cAbGFP4, respectively) and cAbBCII10-A-A-A to have a stability similar to that of cAbAn33 (i.e. DG8Z32(G 2) kJ molK1 and 33(G 4) kJ molK1 for cAbBCII10-A-A-A and cAbAn33, respectively). Importance of somatic mutations abutting the CDR-H The importance of the amino acid residue at position 103, adjacent to the CDR-H3 loop, was emphasized in the first part of Results. Somatic mutations introduced abutting the CDR-H loops likely will affect the loop. Occlusion of grafting these amino acids upon loop transfer on the cAbBCII10 framework might therefore hamper the successful exchange of antigen specificity. Miscellaneous observation We were curious to know whether the scaffold of cAbBCII10 is unique or whether any VHH scaffold is suitable for antigen specificity exchange by CDRH grafting. Therefore, we chose to graft the loops of cAbBCII10 onto our best-characterized VHH, cAbLys3. The chimera cAbLys3-B-B-B could not be expressed in the periplasm (Figure 2(c)), probably indicative of improper folding and degradation. Consequently, cAbLys3-B-L-B was constructed and analyzed. Together with a reduced expression level of 1 mg lK1 for cAbLys3-B-L-B, a decreased affinity was observed with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 400 nM (compared to 7.4 nM for cAbBCII10). The significant drop in affinity for cAbLys3-B-L-B compared to cAbBCII10 is caused mainly by a nearly 100-fold decrease in kinetic on-rate, going from 4.9!106 MK1 sK1 to 5.3!104 MK1 sK1, respectively. As no functional cAbLys3-B-B-B could be expressed, it is anticipated that the framework of cAbLys3 is unsuitable for grafting experiments. This was reflected also in the stability of cAbLys3-B-L-B having a DG8 of 13(G2) kJ molK1, which is more than 20 kJ molK1 less stable than the original cAbLys3. Although cAbLys3 tolerates the CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 of cAbBCII10 on its framework, the cAbLys3-B-L-B is considerably destabilized, and the substitution of the CDR-H2 probably further destabilizes the chimera to the extent that it could not be functionally expressed.

was largely attributed to a nearly 20-fold faster kinetic off-rate, increasing from 1.6!10K3 sK1 to 3!10K2 sK1, and nearly 20-fold slower kinetic onrate, decreasing from 2.1!105 MK1 sK1 to 1.2! 104 MK1 sK1. The observed decrease in affinity of cAbBCII10-L-B-L compared to the original cAbLys3 was rather unexpected, since this suggests participation of the CDR-H2 of cAbLys3 in antigen recognition, which is contradicted by the structural data.31 Hence, these results suggest that the original CDR-H2 loop could be involved in the correct positioning of the additional antigen-binding loops, CDR-H1 and CDR-H3, of cAbLys3. The calculated DG8 for cAbBCII10-L-B-L corresponded to 32(G1) kJ molK1, which is identical with the value for cAbLys3 (32(G5) kJ molK1). This result reveals that the transfer of CDR-H1 and CDRH3 of cAbLys3 leads to a destabilization of the recipient cAbBCII10 framework. These combined data of affinity and stability suggest that all three CDR-Hs have to be taken into account for loop grafting to obtain a fully functional chimera. Importance of the VHH subfamily Even though all VHHs belong to the same family, the equivalent of human VH subgroup III, they can be categorized into various subfamilies, depending on the presence/absence and position of a cysteine residue in the CDR-H1 loop and some specific amino acid residues in their frameworks.32 All previously described chimeras were constructed, starting from the CDR-H loops of VHHs belonging to the same subfamily as cAbBCII10. As seen from the presence of Phe37 and Trp47 in their framework-2 instead of the usual Tyr37 and Gly47 (Ala47 in cAbBCII10), cAbAn33 and cAbGFP4 belong to a different subfamily than cAbBCII10. In addition, short CDR-H3 loops of cAbGFP4 and cAbAn33 (six and ten residues, respectively) are not folding over the "former" VL side as observed for longer CDRH3 loops.33 Moreover, cAbGFP4 was derived from a llama, whereas cAbBCII10 was isolated after immunization of a dromedary. To assess the possibilities and limits of cAbBCII10 as a universal scaffold for VHHs of other subfamilies, chimeras cAbBCII10-A-A-A and cAbBCII10-G-G-G were constructed and analyzed (Figure 1(c)). Both chimeric VHHs expressed similarly to wild-type VHH (Figure 2(d)). The cAbBCII10-A-A-A failed to bind its antigen, corroborating another study that indicated that unique amino acid residues in the framework-2 of cAbAn33 are critical for tight VSG association.33 These residues (Tyr37 and Trp47) should probably also be transferred in order to restore the antigen-binding capacity. This involvement of framework-2 residues in antigen recognition might explain the severe effect of loop grafting on the antigen-binding capacity of cAbBCII10-G-G-G. For green fluorescent protein (GFP), equilibrium dissociation constants of 400 nM and 0.32 nM were calculated for cAbBCII10-G-G-G and cAbGFP4, respectively. This decrease in affinity was

Discussion
The technology of CDR grafting has been used extensively for the reshaping (humanization) of murine antibodies.21­23,34­37 VHHs might benefit from this grafting approach to enhance the stability

604 and/or expression level of relevant VHHs. The absence of canonical loop structures,24,30,31 and knowledge of their key residues make this strategy less predictable for VHHs. In this work, we identified the framework of cAbBCII10 as a potential universal VHH framework to graft various loops of VHHs of subfamily 2. The VHH germline genes belonging to this subfamily are used preferentially during V-D-J recombination to generate functional VHH entities. A total of 75% of the binders isolated from our immune libraries are derived from a germline of this subfamily.32 The cAbBCII10 was essentially chosen for its high level of stability, good expression level in bacteria and its ability to be functional in the absence of the conserved disulfide bond. All chimeras generated by grafting CDR-Hs, from donor VHHs belonging to subfamily 2, onto the framework of cAbBCII10 were functional and generally had an increased thermodynamic stability. For one particular chimeric construct, cAbBCII10-N-N-N, a remarkable gain in stability together with a tenfold enhanced expression yield was observed when compared to the original VHH. For all other chimeras, the stability that was measured appears to be higher than that of the loop donor VHH, and very often approaching that of cAbBCII10. The antigen-binding kinetics of the chimeras suggested that the grafted antigen-binding loops on the cAbBCII10 framework were presented properly. This was illustrated by the crystallographic data of cAbBCII10-L-L-L in complex with HEWL, showing only minor structural deviations of the grafted CDR-H loops compared to the donor CDR-H loops. The CDR-H3 of cAbBCII10-L-L-L, which is most important in antigen binding, is structurally indistinguishable from the corresponding loop in cAbLys3. In addition, the antigen-VHH interactions remain unaltered, demonstrating the plasticity of the cAbBCII10 framework in accommodating different loop structures. A comparison of all VHH structures of subfamily2 teaches us that large parts of the long CDR-H3 loop folds constitutively over the former VL side of the domain, making substantial contacts with framework-2 residues.31 It seems that the two different amino acid residues in cAbBCII10 (Lys42 and Ala47) compared to most of the subfamily2 members do not disturb the proper positioning of foreign CDR-H3 loops. Indeed, these introduced somatic mutations might even be responsible for the superior behavior of cAbBCII10 as a generic framework. By contrast, the presence of the CDRH1 and CDR-H2 loops seems more important to restore the antigen binding, even in cases where the crystal structure of the complexes showed an absence of antigen contacts with these loops. In this respect, the presence of the proper "H4" loop (residues 70­76) might be required as well. The structural importance of the residue at position 71 for the CDR-H2 loop shaping has been demonstrated.38

CDR Grafting on Camel Single-domain Antibodies

Obviously, the CDR-H exchange might be less successful when loops from donor VHHs of other subfamilies are grafted onto the cAbBCII10 scaffold. Indeed, grafting of the loops of cAbAn33 and cAbGFP4 failed to produce high-affinity binding to their respective antigens. In these cases, the result can be rationalized by the fact that loop structures are correlated with particular subfamilies that might be altered when placed on the cAbBCII10 framework. Overall, our results suggest that the framework of cAbBCII10 is a universal acceptor for the transfer of CDR-H loops from donor VHHs of subfamily2. It is interesting to note that even though most of the VHHs belong to subfamily2, the sequence variability in the framework regions between cAbBCII10 and the donor VHHs can be rather extensive (e.g. 8.5% and 18% for cAbHuL6 and cAbPSA-N7, respectively). It cannot be excluded that VHHs other than cAbBCII10 might be good scaffolds to accommodate loops from donor VHHs. However, it is clear that not all VHH scaffolds are able to accommodate other loops (e.g. cAbLys3). The importance of in vitro stability for in vivo performance of the antibodies has been indicated repeatedly in tumor-targeting applications or for the blocking of plant pathogens. Especially, in applications of VHHs as intrabodies, the capacity to fold into functional entities in the reducing intracellular environment is crucial.28 The cAbBCII10 and its chimeras fold properly in such an environment, as the conserved disulfide bond could be knocked out without affecting antigen binding detrimentally (Figure 4), a feature that could not be achieved by other VHHs. This demonstrates that the gain in stability achieved upon loop grafting onto cAbBCII10 will be advantageous for an increased expression level, and for an enhanced functionality when expressed intracellularly. It is expected that the superior biophysical properties of the chimeras will also improve the functionality of these entities under harsh conditions, such as the acid conditions in the stomach or during regeneration of biosensors. A universal framework offering the required properties for use in various applications (e.g. as intrabody, as probe in biosensors or on microarrays) is highly valuable and might be further implemented when employment of VHHs in human therapy is envisaged. The close sequence homology between camel VHHs and human VHs will probably not elicit a host immune response. Moreover, the camel-specific framework residues can be humanized by mutagenesis if necessary.33

were coated overnight at 4 8C in a 96-well plate (Nunc Maxisorb). After blocking, proteins were added and detected with an anti-histidine monoclonal antibody (Serotec) and an anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (SIGMA) with alkaline phosphatase substrate (SIGMA). The signal was measured at 405 nm after 15 minutes. Affinity was assessed on BIACORE 3000 according to the manufacturer's descriptions, either by addition of different concentrations of VHH to antigen coupled onto a CM5 chip or by addition of different concentrations of antigen to VHH coupled onto a Ni-NTA chip. The kinetic parameters kon, koff and KD were determined with the BIAevaluation software (BIACORE) and represented in a rate plane with isoaffinity diagonals (RaPID) plot, i.e. a two-dimensional diagram where points located on the same diagonal line have identical KD values. Stability measurements GdmCl-induced unfolding followed by intrinsic fluorescence measurements was employed to determine the conformational stability. Antibody fragments were diluted to a final concentration of 25 mg mlK1, in buffer containing increasing concentrations of GdmCl from 0 M to 6 M. After overnight incubation at room temperature, the intrinsic fluorescence of each sample was measured at 25 8C. The fluorescence spectra were recorded on an Aminco-Bowman spectrofluorimeter. Samples were excited at 280 nm and emission spectra were measured from 310 nm to 440 nm. The center of spectral mass (CSM) was calculated as CSMZSniFi/SFi where ni is the wave number (i.e. inverse wavelength) and Fi is the fluorescence intensity at ni. Denaturation of all antibody fragments was reversible and data analysis was performed as described.27 The error on the Cm-value was derived from the errors on DG8 and m-values, taken from the non-linear fit. X-ray crystallography Crystallization conditions for the complex of cAbBCII10-L-L-L with HEWL were screened using the Hampton Crystal Screen by mixing 1 ml of protein solution (in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,) with 1 ml of precipitant solution and equilibrating it against 0.5 ml of precipitant solution in a hanging-drop setup. Thin needles appeared using, 0.1 M NaHepes (pH 7.5) 4.3 M NaCl as the precipitant solution. For data collection, a crystal was transferred to 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray data were collected at EMBL station X11 of the DESY synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) using a ° wavelength of 0.8123 A and an oscillation range of 1.08. Data were indexed, integrated and scaled using the HKL suite of programs.39 The structures of cAbLys3 and HEWL as present in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1JTP were used as search models for molecular replacement using PHASER40 and AMoRe.41 Using both programs, a single complex of cAbLys3 and HEWL was located in the asymmetric unit. This model led to an R-factor of 0.42 and an Rfree of 0.45 after rigid body ° refinement with CNS 1.0,42 using all data between 20. 0 A ° and 3.0 A. Analysis of the crystal packing showed it to be incomplete. Difference density for three b-strands and several a-helices was present at a level of 2.0 s and allowed an additional lysozyme molecule to be fitted

PCR. CDR-H1 sequence of the donor VHH was encoded in a primer containing at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends the sequences corresponding to the framework residues of the recipient VHH. This primer, together with the universal reverse primer (RP), was used to amplify a fragment of w200 bp when the recipient VHH gene cloned in a pUC-based vector was used as template. This fragment, containing framework-1 from the recipient VHH and CDR-H1 from the donor VHH, was purified from gel and used as primer together with CALL003 (5 0 GCC GTG TCC TCA GGT TTC AGG CTG TTC A 3 0 ) in a second PCR with the recipient VHH gene as template (a). Meanwhile the CDR-H3 loop from the donor VHH was amplified in a PCR with CALL004 (5 0 CTG AAA CCT GAG GAC ACG GCC ATS TAT TAC TG 3 0 ) and universal forward primer (FP) on the donor VHH gene as template. This fragment of w250 bp was purified from gel (b). Both fragments (a) and (b) were digested with Bsu36I, ligated and reamplified with RP and FP, resulting in a chimeric gene containing CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 from the donor VHH and all frameworks and CDR-H2 from the recipient VHH (c). For the construction of the complete chimeric gene containing the three CDR-H loops from the donor VHH and the framework of the recipient VHH, an additional PCR was performed. Two primers, one back and one forward, containing the CDR-H2 region of the donor VHH and, at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends, the framework regions of the recipient VHH were generated. These primers were used in a PCR with the gene from fragment (c) as template, the back primer with FP and the forward primer with RP. Both fragments were purified from gel and used in a splicing by overlapping extension (SOE)PCR, resulting in a gene corresponding to the frameworks of the recipient VHH and the CDR-H loops of the donor VHH (d). Fragments (c) and (d) were digested with NcoI and BstEII, and ligated into the expression vector pHEN6.9 The plasmid constructs were transformed into WK6 E. coli cells. Chimeras on the cAbBCII10 scaffold are referred to as cAbBCII10-X-X-X (see Table 2), with X being L, P, N, G, A, H and R denoting the loops of cAbLys3 (specific for HEWL),31 cAbPSA11 (specific for prostate-specific antigen), cAbPSA-N7, (specific for prostate-specific antigen),19 cAbGFP4 (specific for GFP), cAbAn33 (specific for variantspecific glycoprotein (VSG) Antat1.1),5 cAbHuL6 (specific for human lysozyme)25 and cAbRN05 (specific for bovine pancreatic RNase A),30 respectively. Generation of disulfide-free mutants The mutant VHHs were constructed by PCR with primers containing an Ala codon at position 22 and a Val codon at position 92. Fragments containing the mutations were cloned into pHEN6 with NcoI and BstEII. Expression and purification of recombinant protein Large-scale production of the recombinant VHHs was performed as described by Saerens et al.19 The purity of the fragments was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie brilliant blue. The absorption at 280 nm was measured and the extinction coefficients (30.1%,1 cm 280 nm values) were calculated from the amino acid sequence to determine protein concentration of the purified VHHs. Specificity and affinity determination For ELISA experiments, the antigens (1 mg mlK1 in PBS)
