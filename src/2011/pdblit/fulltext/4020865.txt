We have used CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and unrestrained molecular dynamics to study conformational properties of a DNA duplex formed by the self-complementary octamer d(GGGGCCCC). Its unusual CD spectrum contains features indicating A-like stacking of half of the bases, whereas the other half stack in a B-like fashion. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations converged to a stable B-like double-helix of d(GGGGCCCC). However, the double-helix contained a central hole whose size was half of that occurring in structure A. In the canonical structure B, the hole does not exist at all because the base-pairs cross the double-helix centre. The cytosine bases were stacked in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) as in structure B, while stacking of the guanine bases displayed features characteristic for structure A. NMR spectroscopy revealed that the A-like guanine-guanine stacking was accompanied by an increased tendency of the deoxyribose rings attached to the guanine bases to be puckered in an A-like fashion. Otherwise, the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) showed no clash, no bend and no other signi®cant deviation from structure B. The present analysis demonstrates a remarkable propensity of the guanine runs to stack in an A-like fashion even within the B-DNA framework. This property explains why the oligo(dG). oligo(dC) tracts switch into structure A so easily. Secondly, this property may in¯uence replication, because structure A is replicated more faithfully than structure B. Thirdly, the oligo(dG) runs might have played an important role in early evolution, when DNA took on functions that originally evolved on RNA. Fourthly, the present study extends the vocabulary of DNA secondary structures by the heteronomous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) in which the B-like strand of oligo(dC) is bound to the A-like strand of oligo(dG).

switches into structure A upon dehydration (Franklin & Gosling, 1953; Ivanov et al., 1974; Kypr et al., 1986). Structure A also is an almost constitutive conformation of double-stranded RNA (Arnott et al., 1972). Propensity to undergo the B-to-A transition depends on the DNA primary structure, though the dependence is much looser than with ÂÏ Â Z-DNA and related conformers (Vorlõckova and Kypr, 1985). Extreme examples of dependence include the oligo(dA).oligo(dT) tracts that do not switch into structure A at all (Pilet et al., 1975), and the oligo(dG).oligo(dC) tracts that do so easily (Minchenkova et al., 1986).

514 structure A can be induced in (G  C)-rich molecules of DNA or poly(dG).poly(dC) by factors (methanol, high polynucleotide concentration, spermine, hexaminecobalt) that do not induce ÂÏ Â structure A in other DNA molecules (Vorlõckova et al., 1984; Nishimura et al., 1986; Benevides et al., 1986; Robinson & Wang, 1996). Oligo(dG).oligo(dC) runs exhibit the helical repeat of 11.1 basepairs that are like structure A (Biburger et al., 1994), which impairs promoter function (Warne & deHaseth, 1993). The internal (G  C)-rich control region of the 5 S RNA gene shows structure A features that are involved in TFIIIA binding (Rhodes & Klug, 1986). We have recently determined the molecular structure of the aqueous DNA duplex of the selfcomplementary octamer d(CCCCGGGG). Remarkably, this duplex was found to combine B-like sugar puckers with A-like stacking of the baseÂ pairs (Trantõrek et al., 2000). This is a novel type of DNA double-helix, having a number of implications. For example, it shows that sugar puckering is not an unambiguous indicator of the DNA double-helix type, which is important because this dogma has caused a lot of confusion in the literature. Here, we have used the same approach to determine the molecular structure of the aqueous DNA duplex of the sequence isomer d(GGGGCCCC). It is shown below that this duplex is more B-like than the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG). Yet it still preserves A-like features that are connected with intrastrand guanine-guanine stacking. Hence, guanine-guanine stacking is A-like even in the B-DNA framework, which has numerous structural as well as biological implications.

Results
CD spectroscopy The present work is focused mainly on the DNA duplex formed by the self-complementary octamer d(GGGGCCCC). Its CD spectrum is characterised by two strong overlapping bands in the vicinity of 260 nm and 285 nm (Figure 1). The two simultaneous strong bands are not displayed by any canonical duplex of DNA and, therefore, the two bands suggest an unusual structure. The duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) melts cooperatively with temperature (Figure 1, inset) and the CD spectrum of the denatured d(GGGGCCCC) is weak, con®rming that the strong CD spectrum of the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) indeed originates from its unusual secondary structure. The positive CD band at 285 nm is displayed by the duplex of d(GCGCGCGC) (Figure 1), which represents the canonical structure B. Hence, we conclude that the CD band in the vicinity of 285 nm re¯ects B-type base-stacking in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). However, what is the origin of the strong CD band at 260 nm? The duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) undergoes a cooperative tri¯uorethanol (TFE)-induced tran-

sition into structure A (Figure 2). The CD spectrum of the A-form of d(GGGGCCCC) has the positive band at 260 nm much larger compared to the aqueous duplex, whereas there is no band at 285 nm. Firstly, this observation con®rms that the CD band at 285 nm originates from B-type base-stacking in the aqueous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). Secondly, the shape of the CD spectrum of the A-form of d(GGGGCCCC) demonstrates that the CD band at 260 nm originates from A-type base-stacking in the aqueous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). It is remarkable that the tetraplexes of d(GGGG) or d(GGGGGGGG) provide a very similar CD spectrum (not shown). This spectral similarity re¯ects invariant guanine-guanine stacking in the duplexes and tetraplexes of DNA (see below). We checked, by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, that there was no detectable amount of tetraplexes or higher aggregates in our samples of d(GGGGCCCC) (not shown). The presence of tetraplexes was excluded by NMR as well (see below). Taken together, the above CD spectroscopy observations suggest that the aqueous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) contains half of the bases stacked

515 pairs can be attributed to enhanced proton exchange with water at the ends of the DNA duplex. The presence of the NOE base-to-base connectivities between the terminal and the preceding base, the absence of signi®cant changes in the values of the glycosidic or backbone torsion angles at the ends of the duplex, and the aromatic proton and carbon chemical shifts of the terminal bases indicate no base-pairs fraying at the end of the duplex. The 2D NOESY spectra provide a set of amino-to-imino proton connectivities indicating, like the imino proton chemical shifts, conventional Watson-Crick pairing of C to G. These connectivities exclude the possibility that d(GGGGCCCC) associates into a parallel or antiparallel guanine tetraplex. The H1H , H2H , C6 and C8 chemical shifts and the inter-proton base-to-sugar NOEs demonstrate that all glycosidic torsion angles are in the anti region. This excludes the presence of the mixed G(syn):C(anti):G(syn):C(anti) tetraplex (Kettani et al., 1995) in our samples. The mixed G(anti):C(anti):G(anti):C(anti) tetraplex has both cytosine amino protons involved in hydrogen bonds, which is re¯ected in the chemical shift of about 9 ppm (Kettani et al., 1995; Neidle, 1999). However, we observe chemical shifts of about 6.8 ppm and 8.4 ppm (Figure 3), which are characterÈ istic for the usual duplexes of DNA (Wuthrich, 1986; Wijmenga et al., 1993). The dispersion of the aromatic proton and carbon chemical shifts and the inter-base proton-proton distances (data not shown) display patterns closer to B-like than A-like structures (Table S1) (Giessner-Prettre & Pullman, 1987; Wolk et al., 1989; Wijmenga et al., 1993). The small ¯uctuations in the aromatic proton and carbon chemical shifts indicate an absence of structural clashes within the duplex (except for the terminal residues). The dipolar data measured under our solution conditions, i. e. in the absence of divalent cations, are not consistent with a bent structure of the d(GGGGCCCC) duplex. Except for the 3H -terminal cytosine base, the S-type sugar conformation was found to dominate in all residues. The values of sugar parameters extracted from the measured NMR spectra are given in Table 1. Generally, the sugar rings of nonterminal guanine bases exhibit lower preference for the S-type sugar conformation, higher amplitudes of pseudo-rotation for both N-type and S-type conformation, and about 30  lower phase of pseudorotation for the major conformation in comparison with the sugars of non-terminal cytosine bases. The parameters of the terminal nucleotides are affected by the end effects. The torsion angles w and b fall into the anti and Æap conformational regions, respectively, and they are uniform along the molecule. The a and z torsion angles can be monitored only indirectly through the 31P chemical shifts and the 3JH3H -P scalar coupling constants (Gorenstein, 1994). Unfortunately, the stereoelectronic effect of the a torsion angle on the 31P chemical shift and 3JH3H -P cannot be separated from the stereoelectronic contribution of

in a B-like fashion, whereas the other half stack in an A-like fashion. Of course, this is a tentative conclusion based only on comparative CD spectroscopy studies. In addition, CD spectroscopy does not offer any hint of how half of the bases can stack in a B-like fashion in a DNA duplex where the other half stack in an A-like fashion. That is why we used NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics to see how the bases are stacked in the aqueous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). NMR spectroscopy The overall pattern of the NOE cross-peaks, their relative intensities and the backbone torsion angles are consistent with a right-handed DNA doubleÈ helix (Wuthrich, 1986). Moreover, the proton, carbon, and phosphorus chemical shifts display a normal dispersion found in regular right-handed helical structures of DNA (Gorenstein, 1994). A continuous train of connectivities was detected, linking the inter-strand neighbouring amino-imino protons of non-terminal base-pairs. The absence of the corresponding cross-peaks of the terminal base-

the z (Gorenstein, 1994). The 31P chemical shift and the 3JH3H -P scalar coupling constants are presented in Figure 4 for the d(GGGGCCCC) duplex. The a and g torsion angles are strongly correlated through the a-g crankshaft motion (Ravishanker et al., 1989; Schmitz et al., 1993; Weisz et al., 1994). Because the g torsion angles of all residues fall into the sc conformational region, the changes of the 31 P chemical shift and the 3JH3H -P scalar coupling constant can be interpreted solely in terms of changes in the z torsion angle. The e torsion angles were found to be localized in the Àac/Àap conformational region, suggesting a BI/BII (e, z; transgauche, gauche-trans) equilibrium in all residues. Values of the 31P chemical shifts and the 3JH3H -P scalar coupling constants indicate that the BII population varies approximately between 45 % and 70 % at the individual nucleotides. Quantitative analysis of the NOE data provides regular base-to-base and base-to-sugar distances, which suggests the absence of structural clashes in the duplex. Molecular dynamics simulations The initial, idealized A-DNA (Arnott & Hukins, 1972) and B-DNA (Arnott & Hukins, 1973)

duplexes of d(GGGGCCCC) were built using the NUCGEN module of AMBER 5.0. Both starting models were subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the Cornell et al. (1995) force-®eld. Each of the MD trajectories was calculated for about 4 ns. The A-DNA and B-DNA initial geometries converged after the ®rst 500 ps to similar conformational ensembles, which were stable for the rest of the simulations. We calculated average structures from the last nanosecond of both simulations. These average structures were Ê very similar (RMSD 0.7 A) and the following describes the average structure obtained from the last nanosecond of the simulation starting from the A-DNA (Figure 5). Similar conclusions hold regarding the average structure obtained from the simulation starting from the B-DNA. The overall architecture of the double-helix of d(GGGGCCCC) can be described as a B/A intermediate structure. The double-helix contains a small central hole when viewed along the helical axis, whose size (re¯ected in the x-displacement of Ê À2.3 A, Table 2) is about half of that occurring in Ê A-DNA (x-displacement À4.5 A). The hole does not exist in B-DNA (x-displacement close to zero) because the base-pairs cross the double-helix centre

nation and roll, and the minor groove width are all B-like. Both grooves are regular and the helical parameters show no signi®cant variation along the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). The crystal structure of d(GGGGCCCC) (McCall et al., 1985) is A-DNA,

The central GpC step was stable in the course of the simulations. No transient conformation was observed. Inter-strand guanine-guanine stacking Â usually observed in the CpG step (Trantõrek et al., 2000) was missing from the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). We did not see any local variation of the helical parameters, sugar puckers or backbone conformations at the GpC step. The double-helix was straight and it displayed no tendency to bend. The backbone exhibited substantial BI (e, z: trans, gaucheÀ) to BII (e, z: gauche À , trans) transitions along the trajectory. The GpG steps preferred the BII backbone conformation more (about 30 %) than the CpC steps (about 10 %). The GpC step showed a similar population of the BII backbone conformation as the GpG steps. We did not observe any a-g crankshaft motion.

Discussion
This work is devoted to a joint CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics analysis of the aqueous DNA duplex of the self-complementary octamer d(GGGGCCCC). In part, this work was motivated by our previous study showing that the sequence isomer d(CCCCGGGG) generated an A-type double-helix even in aqueous solution, though its deoxyribose rings were puckÂ ered in a B-like fashion (Trantõrek et al., 2000). This double-helix demonstrates that sugar puckering is

not an unambiguous indicator of the DNA doublehelix type. Naturally, the unusual properties of the d(CCCCGGGG) duplex raised a number of questions. One was how the properties exhibited by the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG) depend on the DNA primary structure. This question is solved partly here, where we performed an analogous study of the sequence isomer d(GGGGCCCC). The duplexes of d(GGGGCCCC) and d(CCCC GGGG) are composed of two d(GGGG).d(CCCC) segments connected in a head-to-head and tail-totail manner, respectively. As a result of the different arrangement, the octamer duplexes differ by the dinucleotide in the octamer centre and the termini exposed to the solvent. The CpG step is unstable, it switches between two conformers and presumably causes minor groove widening and Â other double-helix irregularities (Trantõrek et al., 2000). In contrast, the GpC step is properly stacked in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC), it is stable in a single conformation and the whole duplex is regular, including the minor groove. Guanine as well as cytosine bases stack in an A-like fashion in the aqueous duplex of Â d(CCCCGGGG) (Trantõrek et al., 2000). A-like stacking means that the bases are pushed towards the double-helix surface, which results in the appearance of a large central hole characteristic for A-DNA. In B-DNA, the base-pairs cross the double-helix centre so that the central hole is absent. The duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) also shows a central hole but its size is about half of that observed in A-DNA or in the aqueous duplex of d(CCCCGGGG) (Table 2). We were puzzled as to

DNA Double Helix of d(GGGGCCCC)

519 DNA dodecamer d(CATGGGCCCATG) (Ng et al., 2000), where the central duplex of GGGCCC has a structure very similar to that of our duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). In particular, these duplexes possess a central hole of a very similar size when viewed along the helical axis (the x-displacement is Ê Ê À2.9 A and À2.3 A with d(CATGGGCCCATG) and d(GGGGCCCC), respectively, Table 2). In addition, roll and inclination are B-like and very similar in both duplexes (Table 2). The d(CATGGGCCCATG) dodecamer was crystallized in the presence of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), which induces A-form in (G  C)-rich DNA fragÂÏ Â ments (Vorlõckova et al., 1996; Kypr et al., 1999). Hence, the similarity between the MPD duplex of d(CATGGGCCCATG) and our aqueous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) suggests that guanine-guanine base-stacking does not change much during the Bto-A transition of d(GGGGCCCC). This view is corroborated by the very small changes in the CD spectrum (Figure 2). We have found (Figure 8) a very close similarity of guanine-guanine stacking in the present aqueous duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) and the crystal structure of a guanine quadruplex (Phillips et al., 1997). The invariance of guanineguanine stacking in duplexes and quadruplexes of DNA is suggested by comparative CD specÂ troscopy studies as well (J.K., M. Fialova & M.V., unpublished results). Another interesting structural aspect is the switch of the oligo(dC) tract from the B-like base-stacking geometry in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) to the A-like base-stacking geometry in the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG). One would say that this switch is induced by the central CpG step that is heavily deformed in the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG), whereas the central GpC step is properly stacked in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). However, the CpG step does not seem to cause

whether the guanine bases, the cytosine bases or both contributed to the central hole compression in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). The answer was the cytosine bases, because they stacked in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) as in B-DNA (Figure 6). The shift towards the double-helix centre was accompanied by an increased overlap of the cytosine bases, as suggested by the band at 285 nm present in the CD spectrum of d(GGGGCCCC) Â (Figure 1) but not d(CCCCGGGG) (Trantõrek et al., 2000). The increased overlap of the cytosine bases was also indicated by the carbon and proton chemical shifts of the duplexes of d(GGGGCCCC) and d(CCCCGGGG) (Table S1). In contrast, the guanine bases showed features of A-like stacking even within the B-like duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) (Figure 7). NMR revealed that A-like stacking was accompanied by an enhanced population of A-like deoxyribose puckering at the guanine bases, though B-like puckering still clearly predominated (but less than at the cytosine residues). In addition, the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) was unwound. Otherwise, the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) was a regular, straight B-form. Hence, the different central step and/or the different duplex ends caused the d(CCCC) tract to switch from the A-like geometry adopted in the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG) to the B-like geometry in the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). On the other hand, the d(GGGG) tract is stacked in the A-like way in both octamers. The present ®ndings have a number of structural as well as biological implications. The ®rst is the behaviour of the oligo(dG) tracts in DNA. Their stacking is A-like even in B-DNA, so that it seems that guanine-guanine stacking is invariant within the oligo(dG) tracts in the course of the B-to-A transition. This view is corroborated by the recently published crystal structure of the

View along the doublehelix axis of cytosine bases stacking in the canonical A-form, B-form and the molecular dynamics structures of the duplex of (top) d(GGGGCCCC) and (bottom) Â d(CCCCGGGG) (Trantõrek et al., 2000). The guanine strands have been erased to make similarities and differences evident of cytosinecytosine base-stacking in the indicated double helices of DNA.

this oligo(dC) switch, because the overall MD structure of the aqueous d(C10).d(G10) duplex (Cheatham et al., 1998) is much more similar to the MD duplex d(CCCCGGGG) than to the present MD duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) (Table 2). Hence, it seems that the A-to-B switch of the oligo(dC) is caused by a terminal effect on going from the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG) to the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC). Effects of the 5H end runs of cytosine bases on the CD spectra of DNA have been noted with other duplexes as well (Sato et al., 1986). However, our preliminary experiments indicate that it is not the 5H end cytosine bases but the complementary 3H end guanine bases that play the crucial role. Guanine tetraplexes are known to be in¯uenced strongly by the 3H end runs of guanine ÏÂ Â ÂÏ Â bases (Penazova & Vorlõckova, 1997). The A-like guanine-guanine stacking that is preserved even within the B-DNA framework is biologically interesting because it is presumably the basis of transcription factor binding to (G  C)-rich regions in DNA (Rhodes & Klug, 1986), and because A-DNA is replicated more faithfully than B-DNA (Timsit, 1999). Hence, the A-like conformation is likely to protect the (G  C)-rich regions against mutations. The improved ®delity of replication could be, for example, important for (G  C)-rich islands regulating transcription of many human genes (Antequera & Bird, 1993). We have recently analysed the genome of Escherichia coli to get a result consistent with the idea that (A  T)-rich regions mutate much more than the È (G  C)-rich regions (Haring & Kypr, 2000). The A-like guanine-guanine stacking has an interesting evolutionary relevance. RNA preceded DNA in the evolution (for a recent review, see Jeffares et al., 1998) and hence one should ask how

DNA managed to take on functions that originally developed on RNA, whose double-stranded regions almost constitutively adopt structure A. The A-like structure of the oligo(dG) tracts within the B-DNA framework provides a possible bridge connecting the world of RNA with the world of DNA. If this is true, then the most ancient molecular phenomena are likely to be connected with the oligo(dG) tracts in genomic DNA. Availability of the (almost) complete nucleotide sequences of the human chromosomes 21 (Hattori et al., 2000) and 22 (Dunham et al., 1999) provides a possibility to analyse this hypothesis within the context of the human genome.

Conclusions
Using a combination of CD spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy and unrestrained molecular dynamics, we have recently determined the molecular structure of the DNA duplex of Â d(CCCCGGGG) in aqueous solution (Trantõrek et al., 2000). This molecular structure was remarkably unusual, showing A-type base-stacking within the B-DNA backbone framework. Here, we have used the same approach to determine the molecular structure of the sequence isomer d(GGGGCCCC). This structure is more B-like but still unusual. Guanine-guanine stacking is A-like in this duplex, whereas the cytosine bases stack in a B-like fashion. The A-like guanine-guanine stacking is conserved also in a guanine tetraplex of DNA. The A-like base-stacking geometry of the guanine strings in B-DNA is recognized by transcription factors (Rhodes & Klug, 1986). It can be a relict of the RNA world and, if this is so, then the strings of guanine should have important roles in transcrip-

The latter measurements were performed under various conditions to make sure that the NMR and CD spectroscopies measured the same double-helix of d(GGGGCCCC) and that this double-helix was suf®ciently stable with respect to small variations in temperature, ionic strength and the pH values, as well as the oligonucleotide concentration. The NMR sample used for measurements in the isotropic media contained 2 mM d(GGGGCCCC) strands dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 100 % 2H2O or 90 % H2O and 10 % 2H2O. A sample containing a suspension of charged, rod-shaped Pf1 virus undergoing isotropic-to-nematic transition in the magnetic ®eld, was used for dipolar coupling constant measurements with the following parameters: 4 mM d(GGGGCCCC) (in strands), 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 100 % 2H2O. The quadrupolar splitting of the deuterium resonance of the 2H2O signal was measured to verify the amount Pf1 virus; the splitting was proportional to the concentration of 9 mg/ml of Pf1. The Pf1 ®lamentous virus was prepared using a slightly modi®ed method originally described by Hansen et al. (1998). Puri®ed virus was dialysed against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. CD spectroscopy The CD spectra were measured using the Jobin-Yvon Mark VI dichrograph in thermostatically controlled (Haake cryostat) cells. The oligonucleotide samples were denatured (ten minutes at 85  C) before the CD measurements, which were carried out mostly in 0.1 cm pathlength rectangular Hellma cells at about 1 mM (nucleoside residues) oligonucleotide concentrations, giving the optimum signal-to-noise ratio. The concentrated sample of d(GGGGCCCC) used for NMR was measured in a Hellma 0.01 cm pathlength sandwich cell to determine that its CD spectrum was essentially the same as that of the diluted sample. The concentrated d(GGGGCCCC) sample was more thermostable, which is natural because the duplex is more populated if the oligonucleotide concentration is higher by an order of magnitude. The B-to-A transition was induced by adding cool 100 % TFE (Sigma) to 1 mM d(GGGGCCCC) dissolved in 1 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.3 mM EDTA at 0  C. The ion and d(GGGGCCCC) concentrations were decreased by the additions of TFE. Starting from 58 % TFE, the measurements were performed in 0.2 cm pathlength cells. Ellipticity is given in units of MÀ1 cmÀ1, whereas the concentration is in terms of the nucleoside residues of the oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide concentrations were determined from the UV absorption spectra (Unicam 5625 UV spectrometer) of the denatured (temperature 95  C) dissolved in 1 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 0.3 mM EDTA, using the extinction coef®cients of 9100 and 8820 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (at 260 nm) with d(GGGGCCCC) and d(GCGCGCGC), respectively. These values were calculated according to Gray et al. (1995). NMR spectroscopy The torsion angle and distance restraints were derived Â as described (Trantõrek et al., 2000). The NMR restraints are ``soft''. They cover mostly broader ranges than the parameter oscillations in the MD trajectories both with Â the duplex of d(CCCCGGGG) (Figure 3 of Trantõrek et al., 2000) and the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) (not shown).

tion as well as replication (Timsit, 1999). From the structural point of view, the present structure is novel by showing that an A-like strand of guanine bases can pair with a B-like strand of cytosine bases to give a stable heteronomous DNA duplex. It will be interesting to see how the A-like structure of d(CCCCGGGG) and the heteronomous structure of d(GGGGCCCC) depend on the base sequence and the sequence context. An RNA-like CD specÂÏ Â trum (Kypr & Vorlõckova, 1985) and the central hole (Tonelli et al., 1998; Ulyanov et al., 1998) are exhibited by DNA molecules containing other nucleotide sequences as well.

Materials and Methods
Oligonucleotides and the NMR samples The oligonucleotides used in this work were synthesized and puri®ed as described (Kypr et al., 1996), or Â Â bought from Generi Biotech, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. The independent samples of d(GGGGCCCC) were analysed and compared by electrophoresis in denaturing polyacrylamide gels on Hoefer slabs (Kovanda et al., 1996), UV absorption spectroscopy and CD spec-

Hence, the restrained structure of the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) will certainly not differ substantially from the unrestrained structure reported here, except perhaps the terminal base-pairs. Orientational restraints were extracted from the measured one-bond proton-carbon residual dipolar coupling constants (1DH-C). The values of 1DH-C were obtained from the difference of splitting of the corresponding signals in 2D HSQC spectra (Bodenhausen & Ruben, 1980) of the isotropic and anisotropic samples. The spectra were collected at 20  C with States-TPPI quadrature detection in t1 (Marion et al., 1989). The acquisition parameters were: 2048 points in t2, 800 points in t1, recycle delay of 2.2 seconds, and 126 scans per t1 block. The spectra were zero-®lled to 1024 and 2048 real points in the t1(13C) and the t2(1H) frequency dimension, respectively. Dipolar data, together with the model structure following from the free molecular dynamics simulation, were used to test the possibility that the duplex of d(GGGGCCCC) is bent. For this purpose, the Rigid Model Validity test (Prestegard et al., 1999) was applied using the SVD program (Losonczi et al., 1999). The following assumptions were made prior to the calculation: (i) the potential bend should be localized at the central GpC step; (ii) bending of the sequence is re¯ected in a slope of the bases. Only the residual dipolar couplings of the bases were used. The molecular model was divided into two constituent parts with respect to the 2-fold symmetry of the d(GGGGCCCC) duplex. The principal order frames were calculated for a set of the dipolar couplings obtained for the ®rst four and the last four bases. Finally, the orientations of the principal order frames were compared (Losonczi et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 1999). Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations All calculations were carried out using the AMBER 5.0 (Case et al., 1997) program with the Cornell et al. (1995) force-®eld. The nucleic acid molecules were surrounded by a periodic box of water molecules described by the TIP3P potential (Jorgensen, 1981). The periodic box was Ê extended to a distance of 10 A from any solute atom. The number of explicit water molecules included in the simulations was larger than 4000. The molecules were neutralized by Na cations using standard parameters for the Cornell et al. force-®eld. The cations were initially placed into the most negative locations using Coulombic potential terms with the LEaP module of AMBER 5.0. All cations were considered as part of the solvent. Calculations were carried out using the Sander module of AMBER 5.0 with SHAKE on the hydrogen atoms with a Ê Ê tolerance of 0.0005 A and a 2 fs time-step. A 9 A cutoff was applied to Lennard-Jones interactions. Simulations were performed using the Berendsen temperature-coupling algorithm (with a time-constant of 0.2 ps). The nonbonded pair list was updated every ten steps. Equilibration was started by 1000 steps of minimization with the positions of the nucleic acid ®xed. After this initial equilibration, all subsequent simulations were performed using the particle mesh Ewald method (PME) for inclusion of long-range electrostatic interactions into calculations without truncation. The PME charge grid spaÊ cing was approximately 1.0 A, and the charge grid was interpolated using a cubic B-spline with the direct sum Ê tolerance of 10À6 at the 9 A direct space cutoff. To speed up the fast Fourier transform in the calculation of the reciprocal sum, the size of the PME charge grid was chosen to be a product of powers of 2, 3, and 5. For dynamics runs subsequent to minimization, initial vel-

DNA Double Helix of d(GGGGCCCC) ocities were assigned from a Maxwellian distribution. Equilibration was continued by 25 ps of PME dynamics, with the position of the nucleic acid ®xed. Subsequently, 1000 steps of minimization were carried out with Ê 25 kcal/(mol A2) restraints placed on all solvent atoms, continued by 3 ps MD simulation using the same restraint. This equilibration was followed by ®ve rounds of 1000-step minimization with solute restraints reduced Ê by 5 kcal/(mol A2) in the course of each round. Then 20 ps of MD followed, with the system heated from 100 K to 300 K over 2 ps. Equilibration was continued by several nanoseconds of production simulation. Coordinates were written to trajectory ®les after each picosecond. The incomplete energy conservation and the weakcoupling method to control temperature can induce energy drain. Temperature was scaled through velocity. This could lead to a growth of the centre of mass translational motion (cold solute/hot solvent problem) (Harvey et al., 1998). To minimize this problem, the centre of mass velocity was removed during the production dynamics periodically in intervals of 50 ps. The results were analysed using the rdparm and Carnal module of AMBER 5.0. No extra processing of the averaged structures obtained by the Carnal module was performed.
