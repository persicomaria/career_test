The structures of Leishmania mexicana cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (Lm iPGAM) crystallised with the substrate 3-phosphoglycerate at high and low cobalt concentrations have been solved at 2.00- and 1.90-Å resolutions. Both structures are very similar and the active site contains both 3-phosphoglycerate and 2-phosphoglycerate at equal occupancies (50%). Lm iPGAM co-crystallised with the product 2phosphoglycerate yields the same structure. Two Co2+ are coordinated within the active site with different geometries and affinities. The cobalt at the M1 site has a distorted octahedral geometry and is present at 100% occupancy. The M2-site Co2+ binds with distorted tetrahedral geometry, with only partial occupancy, and coordinates with Ser75, the residue involved in phosphotransfer. When the M2 site is occupied, the side chain of Ser75 adopts a position that is unfavourable for catalysis, indicating that this site may not be occupied under physiological conditions and that catalysis may occur via a one-metal mechanism. The geometry of the M2 site suggests that it is possible for Ser75 to be activated for phosphotransfer by H-bonding to nearby residues rather than by metal coordination. The 16 active-site residues of Lm iPGAM are conserved in the Mn-dependent iPGAM from Bacillus stearothermophilus (33% overall sequence identity). However, Lm iPGAM has an inserted tyrosine (Tyr210) that causes the M2 site to diminish in size, consistent with its reduced metal affinity. Tyr210 is present in trypanosomatid and plant iPGAMs, but not in the enzymes from other organisms, indicating that there are two subclasses of iPGAMs.

Introduction
Leishmaniasis, one of the diseases caused by trypanosomatid protozoan parasites, affects about 12 million people worldwide. The parasites are transmitted by the bite of an insect vector, the phlebotomine sandfly. In humans, the disease occurs in at least four major forms: cutaneous, diffuse cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. Current treatments are inadequate and can cause severe toxic side effects.1 In leishmania species, as well as in trypanosomes and other kinetoplastid organisms, part of the glycolytic pathway is compartmentalised in specialised peroxisomes, called glycosomes, which are not present in other eukaryotic organisms.

536 form African trypanosomes exclusively obtain energy through glycolysis, and the pathway also plays a central metabolic role in leishmania and other trypanosomatid parasites.2 The inhibition of any of the glycolytic enzymes thus provides a potential therapeutic approach.3,4 Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) is a particularly attractive target for the design of selective inhibitors because the parasite cofactor-independent enzyme (iPGAM) and the human cofactor-dependent enzyme are not homologous and thus share no common features. 5­7 Furthermore, the suitability of this target has been strengthened by RNA interference experiments in which reduced levels of iPGAM in Trypanosoma brucei caused the death of cultured parasites.8 Phosphoglycerate mutase catalyses the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) and 3phosphoglycerate (3PG) in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. The cofactor-independent enzyme iPGAM is active in the absence of the cofactor 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and is found in several protozoa including T. brucei 9,10 and Leishmania mexicana,6,7 as well as in plants11­18 and representatives of nematodes,19 fungi,15,20 algae, bacteria,5,21 and archaea.22,23 All experimentally characterised iPGAMs from eubacteria, plants, and invertebrates are monomers with a molecular mass of 55,000­75,000 Da.24 They have been classified as members of the metaldependent phosphatase superfamily,25­27 which is composed of a wide range of enzymes catalysing the intramolecular transfer of phospho28­30 or sulfo31,32 groups in a divalent metal-dependent reaction. Crystal structures of Bacillus stearothermophilus iPGAM (Bs iPGAM) in complex with two Mn2+ and either 2PG or 3PG have been solved at 1.7- and 1.4-Å resolutions, respectively,33­35 and have an /-type globular shape consisting of two well-defined phosphatase and transferase domains. The catalytic mechanism of this enzyme involves a phosphoserine intermediate and is dependent on the presence of manganese.34 Incubation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid caused complete loss of activity that could be reactivated fully by Mn2+ but not by 10 other divalent metal ions, including Mg2+, Co2+, and Zn2+.21 Recently, the crystal structure of Bacillus anthracis iPGAM has been published and shows the enzyme in an open form with a large cleft between the phosphatase and transferase domains. 36 The sequences of T. brucei iPGAM and L. mexicana iPGAM (Lm iPGAM) share 74% identity, but show only about 30% identity to Bs iPGAM. In this report, the crystal structures of Lm iPGAM co-crystallised with 3PG and cobalt ions are described and suggest important differences in catalytic mechanism.

determined with two different concentrations of cobalt (Table 1). The high cobalt concentration (4 mM) structure was solved to 2.0-Å resolution, and after refinement, the R and Rfree values were 15.5 and 19.9%, respectively. The low cobalt concentration (10 M) structure was solved to 1.9Å resolution, and the final R and Rfree values were 15.6 and 18.3%. For both solutions, the globularshaped structure is complete between residues 4 and 552 with the phosphatase and transferase domains clamped closed round the active site (Fig. 1a). The N-terminal 84 residues of the folded protein are located in the phosphatase domain, and the polypeptide chain then continues to the transferase domain, linked by the first inter-domain loop (Gly85­Gly91). The transferase domain runs from Ala92 to Asn326 and connects back to the rest of the phosphatase domain by the second inter-domain loop (Phe327­Arg336).

537 cobalt ions in metal sites 1 and 2 (M1 and M2). Metal positions and bond lengths were refined using Refmac5,37 restraining the parameters to those known to be ideal for cobalt ions38 (see Materials and Methods for further details). The specific residues and their interactions with ligands and metals are listed in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. Under purification and storage conditions, Lm iPGAM is active and can therefore catalyse the interconversion of 3PG and 2PG. The electron density and difference maps calculated with 2.0-Å resolution data from crystals co-crystallised with 3PG (Fig. 2b and c) did not provide enough detail to distinguish between 2PG and 3PG: both substrates can be modelled equally well. In order to obtain the best estimate of the proportion of 2PG to 3PG in the active site of Lm iPGAM, both 2PG and 3PG were refined individually using restrained refinements with the program Refmac5.37 Occupancy and Bfactor refinement were subsequently carried out using Phenix.39 Both 2PG and 3PG refined to give nearly identical R and Rfree values and very similar results for occupancy and mean B-factors (Supplementary Table S3). Subsequent refinement was carried out using a model in which both 2PG and 3PG occupied the active site each with an occupancy of 50%. This model did not change the R and Rfree values; however, their individual mean B-factors were reduced by 1.6 and 2.1 Å2 (Supplementary Table S3). Refinement of 3PG or 2PG alone at 50% occupancy was also attempted so that the resulting difference map could help identify the ligand composition. However, as both 2PG and 3PG could be modelled in the difference map, this step yielded no further information (an example is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3). The RMSD for all non-hydrogen atoms between 2PG and 3PG is 0.41 Å, with a maximum deviation of 0.85 Å between C2 of 2PG and C3 of 3PG, explaining the difficulty of distinguishing between the two ligands at 2.0-Å resolution. Crystals of Lm PGAM co-crystallised with 2PG diffracted to a resolution of 2.1 Å, and the structure was refined to give final R and Rfree values of 18.0 and 23.6 and gave an almost identical solution (data not shown) to the structure co-crystallised with 3PG. The electron density maps for the active-site ligands appeared very similar to those of the 3PG complex. Similar refinements were carried out with 2PG alone, 3PG alone, and 50% mixtures of both, and again resulted in the conclusion that the active site was occupied equally by both 2PG and 3PG. All 16 active-site residues are conserved between Lm iPGAM and Bs iPGAM (Fig. 1b) and have RMSDs for C atoms and all atoms of 0.42 and 0.61 Å, respectively. It is relevant to mention that for the determination of the 3PG or 2PG structures of Bs iPGAM, it was possible to trap the two separate and distinct complexes because the crystals were grown at room temperature at which the thermophilic protein was essentially inactive.33 Interestingly, a more distant relative in the metal-dependent phosphatase superfamily, Escherischia coli alkaline

The metal ions (Na+ and Co2+) and the substrate and product molecules (2PG and 3PG) are spheres and sticks, respectively. The Na+ is distant from the active site and is likely to play an essentially structural role. (b) Active-site comparison of Lm iPGAM (yellow) and Bs iPGAM (maroon). Two Mn2+ are present in the Bs iPGAM structure.

Superposition of the Lm iPGAM structure at high cobalt concentration (2.0 Å) with the B. stearothermophilus structure (1.9 Å, pdb: 1EJJ)34 shows that although they share a relatively low sequence identity (33%),6 their overall topologies are almost identical (Supplementary Fig. S1) and the RMSD for all comparable C atoms is 1.3 Å. The active site of Bs iPGAM, which is located in the same region as for Lm iPGAM, occurs in a cleft between the phosphatase and transferase domains and shows a very similar architecture (Fig. 1b). (For a sequence comparison, see Supplementary Fig. S2.) The active site of Lm PGAM co-crystallised with 3PG (or 2PG) contains a mixture of substrate and product The active site (Fig. 2a) consists of 16 residues that make contact with the substrate, the product, or the

Co2+ are depicted as pink spheres. Both 2PG (green) and 3PG (grey) are present at the centre of the site. (b and c) Active site of Lm iPGAM showing Fo - Fc difference map (with ligands and metals omitted) contoured at 3.0 for (b) high cobalt concentration (4 mM, 2.0-Å resolution) and (c) low cobalt concentration (10 M, 1.9-Å resolution, contoured at 2.5 for site M2). Both structures show how both 2PG and 3PG can be modelled equally well. The lack of electron density around the M2 metal site in (c) is an indication of much lower occupancy of the Co2+. The side chain of Ser75 is observed as three different rotamers (see the text). For 2Fo - Fc maps, see Supplementary Fig. S5.

phosphatase (AlkP) (449 residues, pdb: 1ALK)30 accommodates metals in comparable environments to the L. mexicana and B. stearothermophilus enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S4). One high-affinity and one low-affinity metal binding site can be identified in the Lm iPGAM structure Activity reconstitution experiments of Lm iPGAM and of T. brucei iPGAM with various metals after treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid showed that full activity was only restored with Co2+.6,10 However, it is unclear whether cobalt is required for trypanosomatid viability by being indeed the only physiologically relevant metal for Lm iPGAM. Whilst Lm iPGAM may have maximum activity in the presence of cobalt in vitro, this may not be the case in vivo where concentrations of cobalt

will be much lower than in activity assays and in crystallisation conditions. Crystals of Lm iPGAM co-crystallised with 3PG in the presence of 10 M CoCl2 showed one fully occupied metal site (Supplementary Table S3). On co-crystallising Lm iPGAM with an increased concentration of 4 mM CoCl2, a second metal site (M2) became apparent. After occupancy and Bfactor refinement using Phenix,39 the positions of both metal ions provided ideal bond lengths to their respective coordinating residues (Fig. 2b). For the high cobalt concentration structure, site M1 was determined to be fully occupied with a B-factor of 11.0 Å2, whilst site M2 was 32% occupied with a Bfactor of 16.5 Å2 (Supplementary Table S3). The Bfactors for both metals are in good agreement with those of atoms in their respective coordination spheres. The Co2+ at the M1 site forms an octahedral geometry with four typical Co 2+ ­ligand bond

Leishmania mexicana Phosphoglycerate Mutase

539 Refinement for the low concentration cobalt structure (10 M CoCl2) was carried out using the same procedure. Again, site M1 was determined to be fully occupied, with its overall coordination geometry almost identical with that determined previously (Fig. 2c). In the M2 site, the Co2+ refined to a very low occupancy (6%; Table 1). The low occupancy of the M2 site indicates low affinity for Co2+ (with an estimated Kd of N1 mM), implying that site M2 does not require a metal ion to confer activity and if occupied could result in inhibition. This effect has already been noted to a small degree,6 but due to difficulties with the assay due to the presence of metal-sensitive coupling enzymes, the inhibitory effects are currently under further investigation. Differences between the Lm iPGAM and Bs iPGAM M2 sites Despite close conservation of active-site residues between Lm iPGAM and Bs iPGAM, the M2 site is significantly smaller than that of its bacterial counterpart. This is illustrated in Supplementary Table S4, which shows that the distances between M2-site residues and the catalytic serine are generally shorter in Lm PGAM. The only major difference to account for this change is in the orientation of His360 (Lm iPGAM) compared to the same residue His339 (Bs iPGAM), which adopt different conformations and are almost perpendicular to each other

lengths 38 for interactions with Asp425 (OD1­ Co1 = 2.04 Å), His429 (NE2­Co1 = 2.14 Å), His496 (NE2­Co1 = 2.11 Å), and 2PG and 3PG (O2P­ Co1 = 2.05 Å) and two longer interactions with Asp425 (OD2­Co1 = 2.64 Å) and 2PG and 3PG (O1P­Co1 = 2.5 to 2.4 Å) (Supplementary Table S1). The Co2+ at the M2 site coordinates in a tetrahedral arrangement with Asp23 (OD1­Co2 = 2.06 Å), Ser75 (OG, rotamer 2­Co2 = 2.01 Å), Asp466 (OD1­ Co2 = 2.07 Å), and His467 (NE2­Co2 2.10 Å). 38 Longer bond lengths of over 2.7 Å are also observed for possible interactions with OD2 of Asp23 and O2P of 2PG and 3PG (Supplementary Table S1). Occupancy of the M2 site also affects the conformation of the Ser75 side chain (Table 1), which is likely to be involved in forming the phosphoserine intermediate during catalysis. The electron density and difference maps for both the high and low cobalt concentration structures (Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6) show evidence for three possible rotamers of Ser75. Occupancy refinement using Phenix showed there to be a good correlation between the occupancy of Co2+ in site M2 and the occupancy of rotamer 2 (Co2+-bonded rotamer; Table 1). The electron density and difference maps for the metal-bound rotamer (rotamer 2) are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6 providing evidence for the presence of two other rotamers and a lower occupancy of the metal-bound rotamer in both high and low cobalt concentration structures.

Fig. 3. (a) Overlay of the active sites of Lm iPGAM (yellow) and Bs iPGAM (maroon). The altered orientation of His360 in the Lm iPGAM structure caused by H-bonding to Tyr210 is shown. An additional Hbond to the substrate is also observed. No residue in the Bs iPGAM structure approaches near enough to form the same interaction. (b and c) Depiction of the different rotameric states of Ser75 at (b) high cobalt concentration and (c) low cobalt concentration. Occupancy of each rotamer is represented by transparency; the lower occupied rotamers are more transparent than the higher occupied rotamers. The Co2+­Ser distance for the metalbonding rotamer is also shown, as are the substrates 2PG (green) and 3PG (gray).

540 (Fig. 3a). The difference in orientation means that His360 not only forms an H-bond with the substrate (Supplementary Table S2) but also encroaches on the M2 site, reducing its size. The change in orientation is brought about by Tyr210, which acts as a H-bond donor to His 360 (Fig. 3a). Tyr210 is near the active site and is not present in the bacterial enzyme. The inserted tyrosine residue is also present in T. brucei9 and T. cruzi40 iPGAMs, as well as in all plant iPGAMs that have been sequenced. 13,15,20,41­43 However, the tyrosine is not present in bacterial iPGAMs,5,36,44­46 nor in nematode,19 fungal, or algal enzymes.15,20 It is tempting to suggest that two classes of iPGAM exist that differ with respect to metal binding properties, depending on the presence or absence of this tyrosine. Available biochemical information concerning sensitivity to chelators and reactivation by divalent metal ions is consistent with this hypothesis. Does Lm iPGAM use a one-metal or a two-metal mechanism? Conservation of metal and ligand binding residues at the active sites of Lm iPGAM, Bs iPGAM, and Escherichia coli AlkP means that these enzymes are likely to share similar catalytic mechanisms.28­30,33,34,47­49 However, the mechanism proposed here for Lm iPGAM (Scheme 1) suggests that catalysis can occur via a one-metal mechanism. It is generally accepted that in both Bs iPGAM and E. coli AlkP, the two metal sites are necessary to maintain active-site geometry during

Leishmania mexicana Phosphoglycerate Mutase

catalysis (Mn2+ for Bs iPGAM and Zn2+ for E. coli AlkP). Moreover, the positive charge of the metal ion can serve as an electrophilic catalyst, thus stabilising the developing negative charges in the transition state of the catalytic mechanism. 50 However, the crystallographic evidence presented here shows that for Lm iPGAM, site M2 remains predominantly unoccupied. In Bs iPGAM, metal coordination to the catalytic serine residue is necessary in order to enhance the nucleophilicity of the OG atom and also to place it in the correct position for nucleophilic attack on the phospho group of the substrate. The distance between the Ser-OG and P reacting centres is 3.36 Å (Supplementary Table S4). In the Lm iPGAM structure, the metal-bound serine rotamer (`Rotamer 2') points away from the phospho group of the substrate and is unfavourably positioned for nucleophilic attack (Fig. 3b and c and Supplementary Table S4). However, the Ser75 conformer `Rotamer 1', which is only possible when there is no metal in the M2 site (Figs. 3b and c and Supplementary Table S4), has the hydroxyl group in line with the phospho group and is ideally positioned for nucleophilic attack. In the bacterial structures, the metal ion in the M2 site increases the nucleophilicity of the serine residue. If no metal is needed in the M2 site of Lm iPGAM, then an alternative mechanism would be needed in order to increase the nucleophilicity of Ser75. Supplementary Table S4 shows the distances between the OG atom of Ser75 and surrounding residues. It is noticeable from the table that residues

553 amino residues was fitted in electron density automatically with a connectivity index of 0.97. The new model was refined using a restrained refinement (Refmac5). A cobalt ion and the substrate molecule (3PG) were identified in the cleft between the two domains from a |Fo - Fc| electron density map contoured at 36 and 16, respectively. A sodium ion was also identified at the edge of the phosphatase domain by |Fo - Fc| electron density map contoured at 4. The ion is located in the middle of octahedral geometry, coordinated by four mainchain carbonyl oxygen atoms and two water molecules. This model was then used as the search model for both structures, which were found using Phenix.39 Molecular replacement and initial model building were done using the autoMR command (Phaser).56 Both structures were subject to several rounds of refinement in Phenix and manual refinement using Coot.57 Positions of the 2PG and 3PG molecules were determined individually using Refmac5. Occupancy and B-factor refinement of these ligands were done using Phenix. Positions of the Co2+ were determined with Refmac5 using link commands in the library and pdb files for ideal bond lengths.38 Final refinement for the occupancy of the metals and the Ser75 rotamers was carried out using Phenix, and the statistics for both structures are given in Table 1.39,58 The B-factors of the disordered serine atoms and the partially occupied metal ions were allowed to refine (with fixed occupancies) once the refinement for the whole structure had converged. Only one residue in each structure (Asn469) is noted to have disallowed geometry, which is presumably due to the location of the residue on a loop where two residues (Asp466 and His467) are involved in metal binding. For examination of the metal coordination geometries, see Supplementary data. Protein Data Bank accession number Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ), with the accession codes 3IGY and 3IGZ for high and low cobalt concentrations, respectively.

Asp23, Asp466, and His 467 are at distances where H-bonding to Ser75 (rotamer 1) can occur. It is therefore conceivable that one or all of these residues can contribute towards H-bonding, thereby increasing the nucleophilicity of Ser75 sufficiently for the phosphoserine intermediate to be formed. A comparison of these distances with those in the Bs iPGAM structure (Supplementary Table S4) indicates that this method of serine activation is not possible for the bacterial enzyme as H-bonding distances are too long. Scheme 1 outlines a possible mechanism for Lm iPGAM, which would not require metal occupancy of the M2 site. In conclusion, the crystal structure of Lm iPGAM shows strong similarity to other members of the metal-dependent phosphatase superfamily. However, small structural differences at the active site, including the insertion of Tyr210, suggest that Lm iPGAM is unlikely to have the same metal dependency as Bs iPGAM. Interestingly, metal reactivation studies indicate Co2+ as the preferred divalent metal instead of Mn2+.6 Moreover, subtle changes at the M2 site result in a metal binding site that has low affinity for the Co2+. It may be that an alternative divalent ion could have a higher affinity for the M2 site; however, the structural results presented here are consistent with a mechanism in which no metal is required for this second site. All published structural and biochemical data suggest that Lm iPGAM has a different metal dependency compared to the bacterial enzyme and may also have an alternative activation mechanism. The presence of Tyr210 (and hence the one-metal mechanism) may be a key characteristic of the proposed new iPGAM subclass from trypanosomatids and plants.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and crystallisation Lm iPGAM-6His was bacterially expressed and purified by metal affinity chromatography. Crystals of the protein in complex were obtained by the hanging-drop method. Extensive details have been described previously and included cobalt during purification, storage, and crystallisation.7 Data collection and structure solution Diffraction data from Lm iPGAM crystals were collected at the Daresbury Synchrotron Light Source. Diffraction data from Lm iPGAM crystals were collected at the Daresbury Synchrotron Light Source, SRS station 14.1 ( = 0.870 Å) and station 14.2 ( = 0.979 Å), with an ACD QC CCD detector, and the data were processed using MOSFLM.51 Initial phases of the low Co2+ concentration crystal structure were obtained by molecular replacement (MOLREP)52 using the crystal structure of Bs iPGAM as a model (33% sequence identity). Using all data to 1.90-Å resolution, rigid-body refinement (Refmac5)37,53 provided R and Rfree factors of 40.5% and 41.4%. The electron density map was traced using the program ARP/ wARP54,55 and the polypeptide chain for 516 of the total
