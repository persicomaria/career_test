Pleurotus ostreatus proteinase A inhibitor 1 (POIA1), which is composed of 76 residues without disulfide bridges, is a unique inhibitor in that it exhibits sequence similarity to the propeptides of subtilisins. In order to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of POIA1, we constructed an expression system for a synthetic POIA1 gene. The wild-type POIA1 was found to inhibit subtilisin BPN with an inhibitor constant (K i) of 3.2 10 9 M, but exhibited a timedependent decrease of inhibitory activity as a consequence of degradation by the protease, showing that the wild-type POIA1 was a temporary inhibitor when subtilisin BPN was used as a target protease. Since POIA1 shows sequence similarity to the propeptide of subtilisin, which is known to inhibit the protease via its C-terminal region, the C-terminal six residues of POIA1 were replaced with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN . The mutated POIA1 inhibited subtili10 11 M and did not sin BPN with a K i value of 2.8 exhibit time-dependent decrease of inhibitory activity, showing about 100-fold increases in binding affinity for, and resistance to, the protease. These results clearly indicate that the C-terminal region of POIA1 plays an important role in determining the inhibitory activity toward the protease, and that the increase in binding ability to the protease is closely related to resistance to proteolytic degradation. Therefore, the inhibitory properties of POIA1 can be altered by mutation of its C-terminal region. © 2001 Academic Press Key Words: C-terminal region; Pleurotus ostreatus; protease inhibitor; subtilisin; temporary inhibition.

structures of the complexes of inhibitors with their cognate proteases have been solved (3). Inhibition mechanisms of serine protease inhibitors have been proposed on the basis of the structures determined (2, 3). The reactive sites of the inhibitors, which determine the inhibitory specificity and potency toward the proteases, are generally located in regions other than the terminal regions (1­3); conformational rigidity around the reactive site and high stability of inhibitor molecules are thought to be required for stable inhibition of proteases (4 ­ 6). Pleurotus ostreatus proteinase A inhibitor 1 (POIA1), which was originally isolated as an endogenous inhibitor of P. ostreatus proteinase A, is different from many other serine protease inhibitors in that it has no Cys residues in its 76-amino-acid sequence, and that it shows sequence similarity to the propeptides of subtilisins. The propeptides of the subtilisin-family proteases have been shown to inhibit their cognate proteases by their C-terminal region, and X-ray structures of the complexes of subtilisins with their propeptides were determined (8, 9). Although the importance of the C-terminal region of POIA1 in inhibition of a protease was suggested on the basis of carboxypeptidase treatment experiments (7), such finding does not necessarily mean that its C-terminal region is a reactive site, since the C-terminal region of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor was demonstrated to be required to maintain the high stability of the molecule rather than determining the inhibitory specificity toward proteases (10). On the other hand, we have shown that yeast proteinase B inhibitor 2 (YIB2), which is composed of 74 residues without disulfide bridges and shows sequence similarity (about 20%) to the propeptide of subtilisin, inhibits subtilisin BPN via its C-terminus (11) in a similar manner to the propeptide (8, 9). We also demonstrated that the ability of YIB2 to bind to a protease is closely related to its resistance to proteolytic attack by that protease. These results clearly indicated that YIB2 shows an inhibitory mechanism different from

that of many other serine protease inhibitors. However, subsequent analyses, including determination of its three-dimensional structure alone and with a cognate protease, which were expected to clarify its inhibitory mechanism in detail, have been unsuccessful, since YIB2 has tendencies to be denatured in acidic conditions and to aggregate at high protein concentration (data not shown). In this study, we therefore constructed an expression system for POIA1 in Escherichia coli, and attempted to show alteration of the inhibitory properties of POIA1 by mutation as the first step in elucidating its detailed inhibitory mechanism toward a protease. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzo, Toyobo, and Boehringer. Subtili-

sin BPN was purchased from Sigma. Other chemicals were reagent grade for biochemical research. Construction of an expression plasmid of POIA1. The POIA1 gene shown in Fig. 1A was chemically synthesized from 14 fragments by almost the same procedures as described for the YIB2 gene (11). After the nucleotide sequence of the POIA1 gene constructed in pUC18 had been confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, the POIA1 gene was inserted into the NcoI-BamHI site of pET11d (12). Expression and purification of POIA1. Large-scale cultivation of E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with the expression plasmid was started by inoculation of a small-scale overnight culture. Gene expression was induced by adding isopropyl- -thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4 mM when A 600 1.0, and the culture was continued for four hours. The E. coli cells were collected by centrifugation, disrupted by sonication in 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, and the cell lysate was applied to a DE-52 column (2 15 cm) after dilution with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). After elution by a 0 ­2.0 M NaCl gradient, the POIA1 fractions were collected and subjected to gel-filtration on Superdex 75pg (1 35 cm) using 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 7.5) as eluent.

Cassette mutagenesis. Cassette mutagenesis was carried out to replace the C-terminal six residues of POIA1. The four oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 1B, after phosphorylation of their 5 -termini and annealing, were ligated with the EcoRI-PstI fragment of the POIA1 gene and the EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pUC18 to produce the mutated plasmid. Mutation was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing, and the mutated POIA1 gene was inserted into pET11d, as described for the wild-type gene. Determination of protein concentrations and inhibitory activity of POIA1 toward subtilisin BPN . Protein concentrations were deter1% mined spectrophotometrically using A 280 of 11.7 for subtilisin BPN (13) and molar absorption coefficient constants ( 280) of 1250 for wild-type POIA1 and 2500 for the mutant (14). To measure inhibitory activity, subtilisin BPN at 364 nM was incubated with various molar ratios of POIA1 at 25°C in 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). After incubation for 0, 60, and 120 min, an aliquot (100 l) containing 1 g of subtilisin BPN was withdrawn and added to 900 l of 0.111 mM N-succinyl-L-Ala-L-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe p-nitroanilide in the same buffer, and the absorbance at 410 nm was monitored. The inhibitory activity was defined as (1 (V i/V o)) 100 (%), where V i and V o are the activity of subtilisin BPN in the presence and absence of POIA1, respectively. For the 0-min incubation, V i was obtained after subtilisin-POIA1 complex formation had reached equilibrium and an inhibitor constant (K i) was estimated from this inhibition profile by the previously described procedures (6, 15). Electrophoretic analysis of the POIA1-subtilisin BPN mixture. Subtilisin BPN at 364 nM and a ten-fold molar excess of wild-type POIA1 (3.64 M) were incubated at 25°C in 0.1 M Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). After 0, 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation, an aliquot (100 l) of the mixture containing 1 g of subtilisin BPN was withdrawn, and the proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 20%. The precipitates were washed with acetone and subjected to SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the mutated POIA1, a fourfold molar excess of the inhibitor was mixed with subtilisin BPN at 364 nM and an aliquot (200 l) of the mixture containing 2 g of subtilisin BPN was withdrawn.

RESULTS Expression and characterization of wild-type POIA1. Wild-type POIA1 was expressed in the soluble fraction of E. coli after induction of the POIA1 gene downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter by IPTG, according to the same procedures as described for YIB2 (11) and the propeptide of subtilisin BPN (16). A Gly residue was added after the N-terminal Met residue to generate the NcoI site, since its effect on the inhibitory activity was considered to be negligible, as in the case of YIB2 (11). The wild-type POIA1 expressed was purified to homogeneity by two steps of chromatography, and was found by sequence analysis to lack the N-terminal Met residue. Although POIA1 was originally isolated as an endogenous inhibitor of P. ostreatus proteinase A (7), we investigated the inhibitory properties of POIA1 toward subtilisin BPN , since P. ostreatus proteinase A has been shown to belong to the subtilisin family (17), but is not available in quantities large enough to characterize. We thought that if the inhibitory properties of POIA1 toward subtilisin BPN were changed by mutation, it would be possible to clearly identify the reactive site of POIA1. Figure 2A shows the time dependence of the inhibitory activity of wild-type POIA1 toward sub-

tilisin BPN at various molar ratios. It is obvious that the wild-type POIA1 inhibits subtilisin BPN . The K i value at incubation time zero was calculated from this inhibition profile to be 3.2 10 9 M, demonstrating that POIA1 is about a 1000-fold less effective inhibitor of subtilisin BPN than is Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (5 10 12 M) (18). In addition, the inhibitory activity was found to decrease as the incubation time increased, indicating that the wild-type POIA1 is a temporary inhibitor when subtilisin BPN is used as a target protease. Since this temporary inhibition was considered to result from degradation of POIA1 by subtilisin BPN , as demonstrated for the propeptide of subtilisin BPN (16, 19) and for YIB2 (11), we carried out electrophoretic analysis of a mixture of POIA1 and subtilisin BPN at a molar ratio of 10 at various incubation times. As shown in Fig. 2B, the band of POIA1 became weaker

protease is closely related to resistance to proteolytic degradation. DISCUSSION Although POIA1 exhibited temporary inhibition when subtilisin BPN was used as a target protease, the finding that POIA1 showed sequence similarity to the propeptide of subtilisin BPN and to YIB2 (11, 20), which have been shown to inhibit proteases via their C-terminal regions (8, 9, 11), suggested that replacement of the C-terminal residues of POIA1 with those of the propeptide may convert POIA1 to a potent and resistant inhibitor. As expected, the mutated POIA1 whose C-terminal six residues had been replaced with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN showed a K i value 100-fold stronger than that of the wild-type inhibitor, and no time-dependent decrease of the inhibitory activity. These results show that the C-terminal region of this inhibitor greatly contributes to the

as the incubation time increased. Bands considered to be degradation intermediates were not detected. These results clearly demonstrate that the wild-type POIA1 behaves as a typical temporary inhibitor when subtilisin BPN is used as a target protease. Effects of mutations on the inhibitory properties of POIA1. As shown in Fig. 3 and described previously (11, 20), POIA1 shows sequence similarity to YIB2 and the propeptide of subtilisin BPN (28 and 18%, respectively). The propeptides of subtilsin-family proteases have been demonstrated to inhibit their cognate proteases by binding of the C-terminus to the protease (8, 9), and YIB2 was shown to change from a temporary inhibitor to a tightly binding and resistant inhibitor of subtilsin BPN by alteration of its C-terminal six residues (11). Therefore, in this study, the C-terminal six residues of POIA1 were replaced with those of the propeptide of subtilsin BPN . This alteration was carried out by cassette mutagenesis, and mutated POIA1 was expressed as for the wild type. The inhibitory activity of the mutated POIA1 toward subtilisin BPN at various molar ratios is shown in Fig. 4A. This profile shows that the binding ability of the mutated POIA1 is stronger than that of the wild type. The K i value was estimated to be 2.8 10 11 M, showing that the mutated POIA1 is about a 100-fold more effective inhibitor of subtilisin BPN than is the wildtype POIA1. The binding stoichiometry of the mutated POIA1 with subtilisin BPN was found to be 1:1. In contrast to the wild type, which is a temporary inhibitor, the mutated POIA1 did not exhibit timedependent decrease of inhibitory activity. Then, the molecular state of the mutated POIA1 in the mixture with subtilisin BPN was examined by SDS­PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4B, the inhibitor band was found to be essentially unchanged after 120 min of incubation. These results clearly demonstrate that replacement of the C-terminal six residues of POIA1 with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN converts POIA1 into a more potent and resistant inhibitor of subtilisin BPN , and that the increase in binding ability to the

strength of inhibition of, and resistance to, the protease, and that the reactive site is located at the C-terminus of POIA1. The inhibitory properties of POIA1 can be compared with those of YIB2, which has also been shown to inhibit a protease via its C-terminal region (11). Mutated POIA1 and YIB2, whose C-terminal six residues had been replaced with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN , showed K i values of 3.2 10 11 M and 11 3.5 10 M (11), respectively. This small difference indicates that the strong binding affinity of the mutated POIA1 and YIB2 for subtilisin BPN is mainly contributed by their C-terminal residues. However, the inhibition stoichiometry of the mutated POIA1 is 1:1, whereas that of the mutated YIB2 is 2:1 (inhibitor: protease) (11). This may be due to the dimeric character of YIB2, whereas POIA1 exists as a monomeric protein. On the other hand, the K i value of wild-type POIA1 was determined to be 3.2 10 9 M, whereas that of 7 wild-type YIB2 was 3.7 10 M, showing that POIA1 is about a 100-fold stronger inhibitor of subtilisin BPN than is YIB2. The time dependence of the inhibitory activity, and electrophoretic analysis, demonstrate that POIA1 is more resistant than YIB2, since POIA1 at a molar ratio of 10 retained inhibitory activity and its band on SDS­PAGE after 120 min incubation, whereas YIB2, even at a molar ratio of 50, lost inhibitory activity and its band on SDS­PAGE after 120 min incubation (11). The differences in protease sensitivity to subtilisin BPN of the wild-type YIB2 and POIA1 seem to be related to the differences in their binding strength to the protease. In fact, we have previously demonstrated, using several mutants of YIB2, that the resistance of YIB2 to proteolytic attack is closely related to its ability to bind to the protease (11). The sequence difference between the C-terminal regions of the wild-type YIB2 and POIA1 was suggested as the reason for these differences in inhibitory properties, since the mutated YIB2 and POIA1 whose C-terminal six residues had been replaced with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN showed only a small difference in K i values, as described above. However, when the sequences of the C-terminal region of the wild-type YIB2 and POIA1 are compared, the C-terminal Asn of YIB2 and Gln of POIA1 show similar substrate preference for subtilisin BPN (18), and the P4 site, which binds to the characteristic hydrophobic S4 pocket of subtilisin BPN , is the same residue (Val) in YIB2 and POIA1. In addition, the characteristics of other residues of the C-terminal region of YIB2 are rather more similar to the propeptide of subtilisin BPN than are those of POIA1. These findings prompted us to consider another more plausible reason for the difference in the inhibitory properties of YIB2 and POIA1, and we proposed that it is the difference in their stability. YIB2, which is usu-

ally a dimeric protein, has tendencies to aggregate at high protein concentration and to be denatured in acidic conditions. These characteristics made us unable to determine its three-dimensional structure in solution by NMR. In contrast, POIA1 was shown by gel-filtration analysis to exist as a stable monomer (data not shown) and to be more stable to denaturation in acidic and alkaline conditions near pH 7. Furthermore, POIA1 shows an obvious thermal transition around 60°C, whereas YIB2 does not. It seems that these features make POIA1 a more stable protein than YIB2. When the inhibitory properties of the mutated POIA1 are compared with those of the propeptide of subtilisin BPN , the mutated POIA1 is a more potent and resistant inhibitor of subtilisin BPN than is the propeptide, although they have the same C-terminal sequences. This may be due to the differences in their tertiary structures, as discussed previously (11). POIA1 was demonstrated to have secondary and tertiary structure by CD spectra measurements (data not shown), whereas the propeptide was shown not to possess three-dimensional structure in its native state and to acquire secondary and tertiary structure after complex formation with a protease (21, 22). Therefore, the existence of tertiary structure in POIA1 results in stronger interaction with its target protease. Although there are several differences in the inhibitory and structural properties of YIB2 and POIA1, these two proteins are similar in the sense that they are unique protease inhibitors whose reactive sites are their C-termini. In other words, they lack a region on the C-terminal side of the reactive site. Their mechanism of inhibition is "product inhibition", which is also found for serpins (23). However, serpins are different from POIA1 and YIB2 in that they possess a region on the C-terminal side of the reactive site in their native state. We are now analyzing by NMR the threedimensional structure of POIA1 in solution, and are attempting to crystallize its complex with subtilisin BPN . In the future, we hope to propose more detailed inhibitory mechanisms of POIA1 on the basis of the structures determined. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
