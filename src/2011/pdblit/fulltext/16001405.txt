Introduction. In order to extend the structural coverage of eukaryotic members in the Protein Family database (Pfam),1 we selected 400 open reading frames (ORFs) from available cDNA libraries of the Mouse genome. One of these, the Mouse gene DcpS (GI: 16740816, PF05652), belongs to the family of scavenger mRNA decapping enzymes. DcpS is a scavenger pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes the residual cap structure following mRNA degradation in the 3 ­5 exoribonuclease pathway.2 The association of DcpS with 3 ­5 exonuclease exosome components suggests that these two activities are linked within a coupled exonucleolytic, decay-dependent decapping pathway.3 The family contains a histidine triad (HIT) motif4 with three histidines (His274, His276, and His278 in Mouse DcpS) separated by hydrophobic residues. The central histidine within the DcpS HIT motif is critical for decapping activity and defines the HIT motif as a new mRNA decapping domain, making DcpS the first member of the HIT family of proteins with a defined biological function. Mouse DcpS has a molecular weight of 37,921 Da (residues 1­351) and a calculated isoelectric point of 5.4. Here, we report the crystal structure of DcpS from Mouse determined using the semiautomated, high-throughput pipeline of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG).5 The crystal structure of Mouse DcpS [Fig. 1(A)] was determined to 1.83-Å resolution by the molecular replacement (MR) method using a search model constructed from human DcpS [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1st0], with a sequence identity of 89%.6 Data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes two monomers, [(chain A residues 38 ­337); (chain B residues 39 ­337)], six 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol) molecules, and 800 water molecules. The Mat©

thews' coefficient (Vm) is 2.56 Å3/Da, and the estimated solvent content is 52.0%. The Ramachandran plot, produced by MolProbity,9 shows that 98.43% and 1.67% of the residues are in favored and allowed regions, respectively. The DcpS monomer consists of 14 -strands ( 1­ 14), nine -helices (H1, H3­H6, H9, and H11­H13), and four 310-helices (H2, H7­H8, and H10) [Fig. 1(A, B)]. The total -strand, -helical, and 310-helical content is 29.6%, 33.3%, and 5.8%, respectively. DcpS consists of an N-terminal domain (residues 33­130) followed by a short linker region (residues 131­147) and a larger C-terminal domain (residues 148 ­337). The N-terminal domain is elongated and consists of two -helices (H1, H2) and two antiparallel -sheets, A and B, comprised of -strands 1, 2, 3, and 6 with 1234 topology, and 4 and 5, respectively. The C-terminal domain is formed by 10 -helices (H4 ­H13) and 2 antiparallel -sheets, C and D, comprised of -strands 7 and 14, and 8 ­ 13 with 123546 topology respectively [Fig. 1(A and B). DcpS forms an intimate homodimer primarily through domain-swapped interactions of two strands ( 4, 5) and 1 helix (H1) from the N-terminal domain [Fig. 2(A)]. The dimer interface in the N-terminal domain is then formed from -helix H1, the 310-helices H2 and H7, the two -strands 5 and 6, and two short loop regions between

282 and 294. The dimer interface is 60% hydrophobic but includes 4 pairs of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between residues Lys59 and Glu84, Glu102 and Arg121, Arg151 and Glu302, and Glu292 and Arg263. The interface buries an accessible surface area of 3936 Å2 per monomer. A structural alignment, performed with the coordinates of DcpS using the FATCAT server,10 indicates significant structural similarity to the recently solved crystal structure of the human DcpS/7-methyl-guanosine-5 -triphosphate-5 -guanosine (mGpppG) complex (PDB code: 1st0).6 The C root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values for individual alignments of the N-terminal (residues 39 ­130) and C-terminal domains (residues 148 ­337) are 1.23 Å and 0.82 Å, respectively. The higher RMSD between the N-terminal domains is due to conformational changes upon substrate binding in the human DcpS/mGpppG structure. Interestingly, a superposition of both structures as a whole requires the introduction of a pivot point at residue 141, indicative of a rigid movement of the Nterminal domain in the human DcpS/mGpppG complex. The overall structural alignment shows an RMSD of 0.89 Å for 287 equivalent C positions. In contrast to the symmetric dimer observed in the Mouse DcpS structure, the DcpS/mGpppG complex presents an asymmetric dimer with an open and closed active site6 due to this large movement of the N-terminal domain

upon substrate binding. While the C-terminal domain remains symmetric, the N-terminal domain shifts by a 30° rotation and a 20° twist toward one of the Cterminal domains in the dimer [Fig. 2(B)]. This asymmetric movement of the N-terminal domain is facilitated by conformational changes in the linker region (residues 131­147). This rearrangement has a profound effect on the two active sites that are located in the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains, where it simultaneously opens one active site, while closing the other one. This rearrangement alters the C ­C distances between Asp111 and Trp175 in the human DcpS/mGpppG complex to 6 Å in the closed side and 36 Å in the open side of the dimer. In contrast, Mouse DcpS features a 28-Å gap (C ­C ) between Asp110 and Trp174, indicative of a relaxed state, where both sides of the dimer are neither open nor closed. Interestingly, both active sites of human DcpS contain an mGpppG molecule, indicating that closure and catalysis in one active site may have an allosteric effect for substrate recognition in the other. The HIT triad in Mouse DcpS is represented by residues His274, His276, and His278, which form part of the active site. His276 is crucial for the catalytic activity and serves as the nucleophile attacking the cap -phosphate in mGpppG.11 The human DcpS/mGpppG complex contains a His277Asn mutation that inactivated the decapping activity in order to facilitate crystallization of the substrate

complex. A superposition of Mouse DcpS with the human DcpS/mGpppG complex [Fig. 2(C and D)] shows that all of the active site residues are well conserved. Several active site residues in the linker region [Arg144(145), Gln145(146)] and in the N-terminal region [Arg53(54), Glu84(85), and Lys127(128)] undergo large conformational changes upon substrate binding. Different rotamers

are found in the open active site for residues Glu184(185), Arg187(188), Asp204(205), Tyr216(217), His267(268), Ser271(272), Tyr272(273), and Arg321(322) [Fig. 2(C)] and in the closed active site for residues Glu184(185), Arg187(188), Asp204(205), Lys206(207), Tyr216(217), His267(268), Ser271(272), Tyr272(273), and Pro287(288) (human DcpS residue numbers are in parentheses) [Fig.

2(D)]. The structural similarity between Mouse and human DcpS [Fig. 2(C and D)] indicates that both mRNA decapping enzymes share the same mechanism and have very similar functional properties. According to the Fold and Function Assignment System (FFAS),12 the DcpS family has homologous sequences only in eukaryotic proteomes. Models for DcpS homologues can be accessed at http://www1.jcsg.org/cgi-bin/models/get_mor.pl?key 16740816. The 16740816 structure reported here represents a scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme (DcpS) from Mouse, whose structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The information reported here, in combination with the human DcpS structure (PDB code: 1st0)6 and further biochemical and biophysical studies, will yield valuable insights into the functional determinants of this protein and extend homology modeling of eukaryotic proteins. Materials and Methods. Protein production and crystallization: The scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme DcpS from Mouse (GI: 16740816; IMAGE: 4511427; SwissProt: Q9DAR7) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a clone obtained from the IMAGE consortium using PfuTurbo (Stratagene) and primer pairs encoding the predicted 5 - and 3 -ends. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pMH4, which encodes an expression and purification tag (MGSDKIHHHHHH) at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by sequencing. Protein expression was performed in a modified Terrific Broth [24 g/L yeast extract, 12 g/L tryptone, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.6] using the Escherichia coli strain GeneHogs (Invitrogen). Lysozyme was added to the culture at the end of fermentation to a final concentration of 250 g/mL. Bacteria were lysed by sonication after a freeze-thaw procedure in Lysis Buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.25 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)], and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 3400 g for 60 min. The soluble fraction was applied to a nickel-resin (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with Lysis Buffer. The nickel-resin was washed with Wash Buffer [50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 40 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP], and the protein was eluted with Elution Buffer [20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 300 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP]. Buffer exchange was performed to remove imidazole from the eluate, and the protein in Buffer Q [20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP] containing 50 mM NaCl was applied to a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 50 ­500 mM NaCl in Buffer Q. The appropriate fractions were pooled, further purified using a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (SEC; Amersham Biosciences) with elution in Crystallization Buffer [20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM TCEP], and concentrated for crystallization assays to 16 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). The protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method13 with

standard JCSG crystallization protocols.5 The crystallization reagent contained 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)3350 and 0.2 M potassium fluoride at pH 7.2. 15% ethylene glycol (final concentration) was included as a cryoprotectant. The crystals were indexed in the monoclinic space group P21 (Table I). Data collection: Native diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS, Chicago, IL) on beamline 31-ID (Table I). The data set was collected at 100 K using a MAR charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. Data were integrated and reduced using MOSFLM14 and then scaled with the program SCALA from the CCP4 suite.7 Data statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure solution and refinement: The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP from the CCP4 suite.7 A homology model based on the FFAS10 alignment between Mouse and human DcpS (PDB code: 1st0)6 was constructed with the modeling program WHAT IF15 and used as a search model. Structure refinement was performed using REFMAC57 and O.16 Refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes a protein dimer (residues A38 ­337, B39 ­ 337), six 1,2-ethanediol, and 800 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. No electron density was observed for residues 1­37, 70 ­75, and 182­185 in chain A, residues 1­38 and 70 ­76 in chain B, or the expression or purification tag. The side-chain atoms of residues 104, 137, 144, 186, 328, 332, and 335 in chain A and residues 69, 91, 110, 144, and 332 in chain B were not visible in the electron density maps and were omitted from the model. Validation and deposition: Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the model was accomplished using the AutoDepInputTool (http://deposit.pdb.org/adit/), MolProbity,9 SFcheck 4.0,7 and WHAT IF 5.0.15 Protein quaternary structure analysis was performed using the PQS server (http:// pqs.ebi.ac.uk/). Figure 1(B) was adapted from PDBsum (http://www.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/bsm/pdbsum/), and all others were prepared with PYMOL (DeLano Scientific). Atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors of Mouse DcpS have been deposited within the PDB and are accessible under the code 1vlr. Acknowledgments.
