Department of Chemistry, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49008 Received April 22, 1983 The multinuclear NMR spectroscopic data of a series of Mo(CO)&PPh&C&&+R) (R = alkyl, alkoxy, aryl, halo, etc.) complexes are presented. Since a change in the paraR group has little effect on the cone angle of the phosphinite ligands, good to excellent correlations are observed between the chemical shifts of many of the 13C, 170, "P, and 95Mo resonances. Good correlations are also observed between the chemical shifts and the Taft of; and q parameters. A linear relationship between the degree of corm&ion observed between the chemical shifts of any two nuclei and the differences in the response of the chemical shifts to polar and resonance effects has been developed. INTRODUCTION

Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy has great potential for use in the design of higbly active and selective homogeneous catalysts by serving as a probe for the electron distribution within these complexes. First, however, it is necessary to gain a better understanding of the effects of changes in the steric and electronic properties of the ligands upon the chemical shit% of the NMR active nuclei in their complexes. Research in this area has led to reports of good correlations between carbonyl 13C chemical shifts and infrared stretching force constants (I-IO), between the carbonyl "C chemical shifts of complexes of different metals containing the same ligands (8, II) and in some cases between the carbonyl "0 chemical shifts and infrared stretching force constants (9, IO) and between carbonyl 13C and I70 chemical shifts (9, 22). Good correlations involving the chemical shifts of other nuclei in these complexes have, with a few limited exceptions (9, 13, 14) not been observed. The lack of good correlations involving the "0, 3'P, and transition-metal chemical shiRs have been attributed, in part, to changes in the steric properties of the ligands (9, IO, 13,
15, 26).

In this work we have attempted to circumvent the steric contributions to poor correlations by synthesizing a series of Mo(CO),(PPh@C&-pR) complexes in which the changes in the steric bulk of the R group will have little effect on the cone angle of the phosphinite ligands while changes in the electron donor/acceptor properties will be transmitted to the rest of the complex through the benzene ring. The correlations between the chemical shifts of the 13C, i70, 3'P, and 95Mo NMR resonances of the complexes have been determined and these results related to the electron donor/ acceptor properties of the R groups using the Taft & and uI coefficients of the R groups.
EXPERIMENTAL

Complexes. The complexes used in this study were synthesized by literature methods (13, 17) and were characterized by carbon and hydrogen analyses with all analyses being satisfactory (&OS%). NMR Spectroscopy. Multinuclear (13C, 170, 31P, and 95Mo) NMR spectra were obtained of 0.50 M &chloroform solutions of the complexes in 10 mm NMR tubes using a JEOL F'X 9OQ NMR spectrometer equipped with either a broadband or a low-frequency probe insert. The instrumental parameters for data acquisition and workup and the standards used are summarized in Table 1. Selected 13C NMR data for the complexes are given in Table 2 while the 170, 3'P, and 95Mo NMR data are summarized in Table 3.
RESULTS

13C NMR. The 13C NMR data for the Mo(CO)5(PPh@C61&~R) complexes are summarized in Table 2. The only data reported for the aromatic carbons are for the P-C and P-O-C carbons because the remainder of the aromatic resonances are overlapped and difficult to assign. Both the P-C and P-O-C resonances are doublets with the P-C carbons having a I'&-[ of 37 to 38 Hz and the P-O-C carbons having a 12Jpcj of 2 to 3 Hz. The small 12&I observed for the P-O-C bonds has been previously reported for a series of Mo(CO),(PPh20-alkyl) complexes (13).

The 13C NMR spectra of the carbonyl ligands of the complexes consists of two doublets with the smaller doublet (I'&-I = 27-28 Hz) due to the car-bony1 trans to the P-donor ligand (truns-carbonyl) approximately 4 ppm downfield of the larger doublet (I"&/ = 9 Hz) which is due to the four carbonyls cis to the P-donor ligand (cis-carbonyls). The magnitudes of 2JK observed for the truns- and ciWyls are consistent with those which have been previously reported for other Mo(CO)S(Pdonor ligand) complexes (7, 8, 23). As the electron withdrawing ability of the para-R group increases, the resonances of the cis- and truns-carbonyls and P-C carbons shift upfield while that of the P-OC carbons shifts downfield. This upfield shift is greater for the resonance of the transcarbonyl than for that of the cis so that the chemical-shift difference between the two decreases as the electron withdrawing ability of the puru-R group increases. The upfield shifts observed for both of the carbonyl resonances are in agreement with the model for metal carbonyl chemical shifts proposed by Todd and co-workers (18). "0 NMR. The I70 NMR data for the cis and tram carbonyl ligands are summarized in Table 3. The resonances of both carbonyl ligands are nearly superimposed with the smaller truns-carbonyl resonance appearing as a shoulder on the downf%d side of the cis resonance. The chemical shifts of both resonances are relatively insensitive to the nature of the R group but both the cis and truns resonances appear to shift upfield, 0.8 and 2.0 ppm, respectively, as the electron withdrawing ability of the R group increases. These shifts are in the opposite direction to the 13C carbonyl resonance shifts and thus in agreement with the model of carbonyl ligand chemical shifts proposed by Todd and co-workers (18).

Each of the 95Mo NMR spectra, summarized in Table 3, consists of a doublet with a 1`Jhlopl of 16 1 to 165 Hz. This lack of change in `JNlop as the R group is varied suggests that the R group has little effect on the hybridization of the P atom. The position of the 95Mo resonance is sensitive to the nature of the R group and shifts downfield as the electron withdrawing ability of the R group increases. The linewidths of the 95Mo resonances are also sensitive to the nature of the R group with the smallest linewidth found for the R = H complex (3) and the largest for the X = COPh (9) and X = COMe (I 2) complexes. There appears to be an increase of linewidth with the bulkiness of the R group, but this is not always the case as the X = But (I) and X = Me (2) complexes have nearly identical linewidths (40 Hz and 39 Hz, respectively).

Chemical-shift correlations. Previous multinuclear NMR studies of metal-carbonyl complexes with P-donor ligands have shown that poor correlations are generally

observed between the chemical shifts of the various nuclei as the P-donor ligands are varied (9, 13, 18, 19). These poor correlations have been attributed, in part, to concurrent changes in both the steric and electronic properties of the P-donor ligands. Thus it was of interest to study the relationships between the chemical shifts in a series of complexes in which only the electronic properties of the ligands are allowed to vary. This should be the case for the Mo(CO),(PPh@C&-pR) complexes used in this study since variation of the para-phenoxy substituent will have little effect on the cone angle of the P-donor ligands but should influence their electron donor/ acceptor abilities. The one disadvantage of the complexes used in this study is that the para-phenoxy substituent is relatively distant from the nuclei of interest and this results in only small changes in their chemical shifts with variation in the para substituent. However, these changes are stiII significantly greater than the precision of the NMR measurement (change in chemical shift/measurement precision > 10) for the 95M~, 3'P, cis- and trans-carbonyl 13C and P-C and P-O-C 13C resonances. This allows the observation of systematic variations in the chemical shifts of the nuclei with substitution at the para position. The correlation coefficients calculated between the chemical shifts of the nuclei discussed above are summarized in Table 4. These correlations are, in all cases3better than those observed between the chemical shifts of similar nuclei for a series of cisMo(C0)4(PPh2XR)2 (X = NH, 0, S; R = alkyl, aryl, or siIy1) complexes (9, 19) in which variations in both the steric and electronic properties of the Pdonor ligands occur. In particular the good to excellent correlations between the "IGo chemical shif3s and the POC and cis- and tr~ns-`~C chemical shifts and between the 3'P chemical shifts and the P-C and Iruns-carbonyl 13C chemical shifts are unprecedented. The good correlations with the 3'P chemical shifts must reflect the lack of change in the cone angles of the P-donor ligands as the para-phenoxy substituent is varied since previous workers have demonstrated that changes in the cone angles of the Pdonor ligands and the concomitant changes in the hybridization of the phosphorus result in poor correlations between the chemical shifts of the "P nucleus and other nuclei in the complexes (15, 16). Correlations between chemical shifis and TaJl IJ`s. Although good correlations are observed between many of the chemical shifts of the Mo(CO)s(PPh@C&L-pR) complexes, some poor correlations are still observed. These poor correlations may be due

to differing sensitivities of the various chemical shifts to changes in the polar and resonance electronic effects of the para-phenoxy substituents. To investigate the relationship between the chemical shifts observed for the various nuclei and the polar and resonance effects of the paru-phenoxy substituents, the various chemical shifts (6;) have been fitted to the known polar (at) and resonance (ug) substituent constants (20) of the paru-phenoxy substituent using the equation sf: = p1a1 + &J; + SE.

111

The pi and pI coefficients calculated from Eq. [l] are a measure of the transmission of resonance and polar effects, respectively, to nucleus N while S", is the calculated chemical shift of nucleus N when the puru substituent is H. These data together with the calculated correlation coefficients are summarized in Table 5. The F test for significance shows that all correlations in Table 5 are significant at the 0.1% level. This method was originally based on equilibrium and reactivity measurements but has recently been used to correlate both spin- l/2 (primarily 13C and 19F) (21-25) and quadrapolar (95Mo) (14) chemical-shift data. The correlations between the chemical-shift data and the uI, ai substituent parameters are all good (r 3 0.93) indicating that uI , ui is an excellent measure of effect of the puru-phenoxy substituent upon the various chemical shifts. However, it is apparent from the differences in the relative magnitudes of pi and pI of the various chemical shifts that the sensitivity of the chemical shifts to polar and resonance effects varies greatly. A linear measure of the chemical shifts' relative sensitivity to polar and resonance effects termed the relative polar contribution, I, can be calculated from the polar and resonance transmission coefficients from the equation
1 = PIl(P1 + P3.

121

These values, which are summarized in Table 5, indicate that both the type of nucleus and the position of that nucleus in the complex have significant effects upon the chemical-shift sensitivity to polar and resonance effects. For example, both the P-C 13C nucleus and the 95Mo nucleus are bonded to the phosphorus and thus are nearly equidistant from the para phenoxy substituent, yet their chemical shifts have relative inductive contributions of 0.60 and 0.29, respectively, while the relative inductive

contributions to the chemical shifts of the four different 13C nuclei in the complexes vary from 0.20 to 0.60. Since the relative inductive contribution is a linear measure of the polar contribution to the chemical shift it was of interest to determine if a linear relationship existed between differences in the relative inductive contributions of the chemical shifts and the degree of correlation observed between the chemical shifts. A plot of the dif%renees in relative inductive contribution (N) of the chemical shifts versus the chemicalshift correlation coefficients (r) calculated for correlations between the chemical shifts is shown in Fig. 1 and the correlation between AZ and r is excellent (r for the plot = -0.94). This is an extremely signilicant finding since it indicates that the of correlation between any two chemical shil3.s is a linear function of the similarity in their response to polar and resonance effects for the Mo(CO)5(PPh&C&-p-R) complexes. It is tempting to postulate that this is a general effect which will be observed for any series of complexes in which the steric effects remain invariant, but con&mation of this postulate must await further studies of complexes of this type.
CONCLUSION

In this study we have demonstrated that, in a series of Mo(CO),(PPh@C&-PR) complexes in which the P-donor ligands have constant cone angles, good correlations can be observed between the chemical shifts of nuclei such as 95Mo and 3'P, which previously have been observed to give poor correlations, and the chemical shifts of other nuclei. The chemical-shift data can also be fitted to known polar and resomce substituent parameters of the puru-phenoxy substituents to determine the sensitivity of the various chemical shifts to polar and resonance e@ects.Finally, a linear relationship between the degree of correlation observed between the chemical shifts of any two nuclei and the difference in the response of the chemical shifts to polar and resonance effects has been developed.
