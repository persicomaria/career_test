knockout mice, which have defects in autophagy, the authors confirmed that the LD lipolysis in hepatocytes is autophagy dependent. Moreover, by EM analysis of wild-type mice, the authors describe three kinds of autophagosomes distinguished by their content: some contain only LDs, some contain both LDs and other cytoplasmic constituents, while others do not contain detectable LDs. Long starvation periods lead to an increase in LD-containing autophagosomes (lipophagosomes), highlighting the physiological significance of this process for survival. Furthermore, using high fat diet-fed mice, the authors suggest that autophagy is inhibited following excessive lipid consumption-- a process that may have major therapeutic implications. However, further experiments are needed to elucidate this process. In summary, lipophagy may act on the one hand as a homeostatic regulator that controls the size and number of LDs under basal conditions and on the other hand as a stress-induced survival mechanism that provides the cell with energy source (Figure 1). These exciting findings suggest that a novel type of autophagy (lipophagy) specifically regulates lipid homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanism by which the autophagic machinery recognizes LDs is not clear. Several LD resident proteins regulate TGs degradation by cytosolic lipases and thus may play a role in the selective recruitment of the autophagic machinery. It remains unclear which lysosomal lipase(s) is responsible for TG breakdown. The identification of lipid-specific autophagy by Singh and colleagues (2009) raises new questions concerning the relationship between lipophagy and canonical autophagy as well as between lipophagy and cytosolic lipolysis. Thus, exploring whether cytosolic lipolysis also plays a role in LD clearance under starvation or in response to lipid load will greatly contribute to the understanding of this field of study. Similarly, it is also important to test whether the autophagic process contributes to what has been known as a cytosolic lipolysis, induced by stimuli such as chronic exposure of adipocytes to TNF and insulin. The regulation of the LD cycle of accumulation and degradation by lipophagy may also have great physiological consequences, since an impaired cycle could lead to disorders associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes (like fatty liver diseases). Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanism governing this process may provide new therapeutic tools.

RITS (RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing complex) plays diverse roles in heterochromatin regulation: silencing transcription by recruitment of chromatin modifiers and destroying transcripts by RNAi. In a recent issue of Molecular Cell, Li et al. now show that the polymerization of Tas3, a component of RITS, contributes to the spreading of silencing mediated by RITS.
One of the oldest and most interesting questions in the field of gene expression is how genes can be turned on or off dependent on their location within the genome. This effect, coined position effect variegation (PEV), relies on the ``spreading'' of states of activity or inactivity and can in some cases regulate gene expression over tens of kilobases of DNA. A number of chromatin binding complexes have been implicated in such spreading and several distinct models of spreading have been proposed (Talbert and Henikoff, 2006). In some cases, spreading is linked to the active progression of polymerases through a locus, while in others spreading is more passive, ``oozing'' independent of polymerase. In such oozing models, binding of a chromatin regulatory complex is followed by reiterative cycles of multimerization and recruitment of enzymatic activity, leading to modification of adjacent nucleosomes, further binding of the complex and spreading along chromatin.

In a recent paper in Molecular Cell, Li et al. (2009) link these two models for the spreading of silencing. They demonstrate that Tas3, a key player in the RITS complex that implements transcription-coupled spreading of silencing at the fission yeast centromere, can itself spread by multimerization. Importantly however, this oozing by Tas3 is not linked to recruitment of the major enzymatic activity responsible for heterochromatin assembly in fission yeast, the histone H3 K9 methyltransferase KMT1 (Clr4). These new data suggest that even within the same protein complex, both transcription-coupled and oozing mechanisms can work together to achieve robust heterochromatin assembly at fission yeast centromeres. Fission yeast centromeres, although classically considered transcriptionally inert, in fact rely heavily on transcription and on the degradation of transcripts by RNAi, for their assembly into heterochromatin (reviewed in Djupedal and Ekwall, 2009). The outer domains of the centromeres are transcribed by RNA pol II during S phase. These transcripts are converted into double-stranded RNA and then degraded into siRNAs by the activity of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase complex (RDRC) and dicer. The siRNAs then feed back into RITS, where they promote the sequence-dependent destruction of nascent transcripts. This leads to a reduction in steady-state levels of centromeric transcripts but also recruits robust KMT1 activity, which is critical for retention of RITS and RDRC on centromeric repeats, and for recruitment of other silencing proteins such as Swi6, the fission yeast homolog of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). RITS is thus a critical player in the assembly of centromeric heterochromatin, linking the RNAi pathway with the recruitment of robust KMT1 activity to reinforce the defining mark of heterochromatin, H3K9me, in centromeric domains (Verdel et al., 2004). RITS consists of a chromodomain-containing protein, Chp1, which binds to H3K9me, the argonaute protein, Ago1, which binds to siRNAs and promotes cleavage of nascent transcripts, and Tas3, which bridges Ago1 and Chp1. The binding of RITS to heterochromatin is codependent on the RDRC-dicer complex and on H3K9me. Previous studies demonstrated that transgenes inserted within the centromere are subject to PEV and that heterochromatin marks can spread over the transgene from the adjacent centromeric sequences (Partridge et al., 2000, and references within). More recently, the stringency of silencing of these transgenes was correlated with their position relative to the pol II promoter that drives synthesis of the centromeric transcripts (Djupedal et al., 2005; Irvine et al., 2006). Thus genes inserted downstream of the promoter (within the otr region of the centromere) are silenced more effectively than those that lie upstream of the promoter (in the imr region). These findings suggested that transgenes in otr are silenced by transcription-mediated spreading. Furthermore, this process relies not just on the act of transcription, but also on the destruction of transcripts by the RNAi pathway, since RNAi-defective mutants accumulate centromeric and transgene transcripts and notably lose the H3K9me mark specifically on the centromeric transgene (Irvine et al., 2006; Buker et al., 2007). What has been less clear, however, is how silencing spreads onto sequences in imr that lie upstream of the centromeric promoter. Li et al. (2009) now demonstrate that RITS also plays a role in oozing of silencing at the imr region. Using structural determination, they demonstrate that the alpha helical C-terminal domain of Tas3 (TAM) can self-associate through hydrophobic interactions to form a helical polymer. They also identify hydrophobic residues at the polymer interface that are critical for TAM polymerization in vitro. Yeast strains with mutations in these residues, or lacking the TAM domain, showed selective loss of silencing of a transgene inserted within imr compared with more robust silencing of an otr transgene. In addition, Tas3's association with the transgene at imr was abolished. Thus, polymerization of Tas3 is required for its spreading onto, and silencing of, the transgene sequence at imr. Interestingly, however, these mutants showed no change in H3K9me2 levels on either the transgene or native centromeric sequences, which suggests that spreading of Tas3 via its polymerization is not necessary for the retention of KMT1 at imr. However, there was a profound decrease in centromeric siRNAs in the polymerization mutants. So why does loss of Tas3 polymerization impact Tas3's ability to associate with chromatin, and why is this defect most pronounced in regions of the centromere that are not heavily transcribed? The authors found no defect in Tas3's incorporation into RITS. However, they did not test whether TAM mutants reduced the association between RITS and RDRC-dicer, a result which would be consistent with reduced synthesis of siRNAs. An alternative possibility is that without the drive for Tas3 polymerization, the effective concentration of other RITS components at centromeric repeats is greatly reduced. Chp1 is a relatively lowabundance protein, and loss of RITS polymerization could reduce local concentrations of Chp1 to a point where it may be replaced on chromatin by the more abundant H3K9me-binding proteins such as Swi6 which are normally held at bay by Chp1 because of their lower affinity for H3K9me (Schalch et al., 2009). Such displacement of RITS could then reduce RDRC association with centromeres and reduce production of siRNAs. The competition for occupancy of chromatin between RITS and other H3K9me-binding proteins may be most intense in centromeric domains that are not transcribed, since RITS recruitment to those sites relies heavily on Chp1, whereas in transcribed domains RITS can be recruited through both Ago1's association with siRNAs and Chp1's affinity for H3K9me. The observation that silencing of a transgene at otr is unaffected even though there is a substantial decrease in siRNAs in the TAM mutants suggests that the RITS pathway can tolerate wide fluctuations in siRNA levels to maintain H3K9me. Similarly, heterochromatin maintenance at otr is unaffected when Chp1's association with chromatin is greatly reduced (Schalch et al., 2009). Together, these findings suggest that it is only when association of RITS with centromeres is completely abolished that KMT1 recruitment is defective and that an important facet of heterochromatin maintenance and spreading is perhaps the ability of KMT1 to both bind and propagate the H3K9me mark (Zhang et al., 2008). Future challenges will be to determine the mechanism of interplay between these different chromatin modifying complexes at centromeres, and to determine how conserved these processes are in mammals.
