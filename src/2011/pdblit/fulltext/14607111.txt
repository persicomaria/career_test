Depletion and deletion analyses of eucaryotic translation initiation factor 1A in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Mami Kainuma, John W.B. Hershey*
Department of Biological Chemistry, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA (Received 23 December 2000; accepted 30 March 2001) Abstract -- Translation initiation factor eIF1A is a highly conserved, small, acidic protein that is required for cell growth in yeast. Biochemical studies in vitro implicate eIF1A in dissociating ribosomes, promoting methionyl-tRNAi binding to 40S ribosomal subunits, scanning of mRNAs and recognizing the AUG initiation codon. To elucidate the pleiotropic functions of eIF1A in vivo, the factor was depleted by placing its gene behind the repressible GAL1 promoter. After Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells were shifted to glucose medium, depletion of eIF1A was seen after 3­4 generations, corresponding with cessation of cell growth. Polysome profiles of the depleted strain showed ribosome run-off from mRNAs, indicating that eIF1A is involved in the initiation phase of translation. A decrease in free 40S ribosomes and an apparent increase in free 60S ribosomes were attributed to the formation of 40S subunit dimers. The result suggests that one of the functions of eIF1A is to prevent formation of 40S dimers. Mutant forms of eIF1A lacking either the positively charged N-terminal region or the negatively charged C-terminal region were constructed and tested for their ability to confer cell growth as the sole source of eIF1A. Either deletion supports cell growth, albeit at a slower rate, and causes a reduction in polysomes, although eIF1A lacking the N-terminal region is more deleterious. Therefore the charged terminal regions contribute to, but are not absolutely essential for, eIF1A function. © 2001 Société française de biochimie et biologie moléculaire / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

1. Introduction Protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells is promoted by at least 12 proteins called eucaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). These factors function by transiently binding to ribosomes, initiator methionyl-tRNAi (Met-tRNAi) and/or mRNA during the initiation phase (reviewed in [1]). One of these, eIF1A (formerly called eIF-4C or M2B in mammalian cells and D2d in plants) is a small (Mr 16 400­17 400) acidic (pI 4.7­4.9) protein that has been purified from rabbit reticulocytes, plants and the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The factor is required for maximal rates of in vitro protein synthesis in both the mammalian and plant systems. Suggested functions include promotion of the dissociation of ribosomes into subunits, stabilization of Met-tRNAi binding to 40S ribosomal subunits and facilitation of mRNA binding to 40S preinitiation complexes. In recent studies, it was shown that eIF1A functions catalytically in the binding of the ternary complex of eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi to 40S ribo*Correspondence and reprints.

somes [2] and subsequently promotes the scanning of the 5'-UTR and recognition of the initiator codon [3]. The prokaryotic homolog of eIF1A, IF1, binds in the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit [4, 5] and interacts directly with IF2 [6]. Because eIF1A also interacts directly with eIF5B [7] (the IF2 homolog), it may help direct Met-tRNAi binding into the P site. However, identifying the precise function of eIF1A remains elusive. eIF1A exhibits strong conservation of primary structure among eucaryotic species. Amino acid sequence comparisons show 68% identity between human and wheat germ and 65% identity between human and yeast eIF1A [8, 9]. eIF1A from different species from yeast to man is functionally interchangeable in heterologous in vitro assay systems [9, 10] and the human cDNA can function in place of the yeast gene in vivo [8]. These results strongly suggest that the active sites or domains of the factor are highly conserved among eucaryotic cells. Moreover, the protein from all of these species possesses numerous charged residues at both termini, namely a positively charged N-terminal domain and a negatively charged C-terminal domain. A 3-dimensional structure for human eIF1A has been determined by NMR spectroscopy [11]. The highly charged N- and C-terminal regions of the protein were unstructured and could not be modeled. We previously reported that human eIF1A binds RNA, a function that may involve the N-terminal lysine- and

506 arginine-rich region. In vivo evidence to support the findings is still lacking. The yeast gene for eIF1A, TIF11, is essential [8] and is located on chromosome XIII. To obtain a better understanding of the structure and function of eIF1A in vivo, we have characterized the factor in yeast utilizing both genetic and biochemical approaches. Here we describe investigations of the effect of eIF1A levels on translation by constructing a TIF11 conditional strain. Ribosomal runoff of polysomes at low levels of eIF1A implicates the factor in the initiation phase. Mutant forms of eIF1A with either of the charged terminal domains deleted also were analyzed to assess the importance of these regions for protein synthesis. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Strains and genetic manipulations The genotypes and sources of S. cerevisiae strains used or constructed in this work are described in table I. Yeast cells were grown in YP or synthetic minimal medium (S) supplemented with the relevant amino acids and 2% glucose (D) or 2% galactose (G) as described [12]. Media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) were prepared as described [13]. Cultures were grown at 30 °C and were monitored by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Yeast DNA transformations were carried out by standard procedures [14]. 2.2. Construction of strains CM3 and CM4 A centromeric low copy number TIF11-expressing plasmid YCp50-TIF11 was constructed as follows. The 767 bp BglII-EcoRV fragment from pSP72-TIF11 (figure 1A) [8] containing the TIF11 promoter and coding region as well as 123 bp of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) was blunt-ended and ligated into YCp50 [13] blunt-ended at the SalI site. YCp50-TIF11 was introduced into strain CM1 (figure 1B) [8] and pW-y1A was removed by

growing the transformants in the presence of tryptophan but in the absence of uracil (pW-y1A harbors the TRP1 marker and YCp50-TIF11 harbors the URA3 marker). One of the cured transformants was called CM3 and the absence of pW-y1A was confirmed by failure to grow in medium lacking tryptophan. The TIF11 overexpressing plasmid YEp51-TIF11 was constructed as follows. A blunt-ended SpeI-EcoRV fragment from pSP72-TIF11 which carries the entire TIF11 open reading frame was ligated into YEp51 [13] bluntended at the SalI site downstream from the GAL10 promoter. Strain CM1 was transformed with YEp51-

Translation initiation factor eIF1A TIF11 and pW-y1A was removed by growing the transformants in the presence of tryptophan and the absence of leucine (YEp51-TIF11 harbors the 2 micron origin and the LEU2 marker). One of the cured transformants was called CM4 and the absence of pW-y1A was confirmed as above. 2.3. Construction of plasmids expressing N-terminal (N) and C-terminal (C) deletion mutant forms of eIF1A A gene encoding an -terminal deletion form of eIF1A was constructed as follows. The 612 bp SpeI/EcoRV fragment from pSP72-TIF11 was ligated to SpeI/EcoRVdigested pBluescript SKII (Stratagene) to generate pBlueSK-1A. A N primer, 5'-AGTACTAGTCATATG GGCCAAGAATATACTC-3', was designed to contain an SpeI site (italicized), followed by the ATG initiation codon (bold) nested in an NdeI restriction site (underlined). PCR amplification of pBlueSK-1A with the N and T7 primers produced a 500 bp product encoding eIF1A with 31 codons removed from the positively charged N-terminus (figure 4A). The PCR product was digested with SpeI and EcoRV and subcloned into the pBluescript SKII polylinker digested with the same enzymes to generate pBlueSK-1AN. The in-frame deletion was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Digestion at the vector sites XbaI/Asp718-generated a ca. 500 bp fragment which contains the N-terminal deleted form of TIF11 and 123 bp 3'UTR. The fragment was subcloned into pSP73 digested with the same enzymes, resulting in pSP73-1AN. Finally, digestion at the SalI sites in the vector generated a fragment (containing the entire truncated gene) which was ligated into SalI-digested YEp51 to yield YEp51-1AN, which carries the 2 micron origin and the LEU2 marker. A gene encoding a C-terminal deletion form of eIF1A was constructed as follows. pBlueSK-1A was subjected to digestion with HincII, which cuts within the coding region of TIF11 and in the polylinker (see figure 5B), followed by religation to yield pBS-C. pBS-C lacks 97 bp of C-terminal coding sequence and the 3'-UTR of TIF11. pBS-C was digested with XbaI and XhoI and the fragment was blunt-ended and ligated into the blunt-ended SalI site of YEp51 to yield YEp51-1AC. The orientation of the insert and an in-frame translational stop codon 12 codons downstream from the deletion site were confirmed by DNA sequencing. 2.4. Affinity purification of antibody An S30 lysate was prepared from CM4 and fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The region of the blot containing eIF1A was excised and used for affinity-purification of antihuman eIF1A antibodies [15] as described previously [16]. The affinity-purified antibodies were stored at ­70 °C and used at 1:3000 dilution. 2.5. Yeast polysome analysis

The prt1-1 strain TP11B-4-1 was grown to midexponential phase at the permissive temperature, 25 °C. For growth at the non-permissive temperature, midexponential phase cultures in YPD at 25 °C were shifted to 37 °C and grown for an additional 30 min. Cycloheximide (100 µg/mL) was added to the culture, followed by quick cooling by swirling the culture on ice. The cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with ice-cold water and resuspended in buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 µg/mL heparin, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF in DEPCtreated H2O) plus 100 µg/mL cycloheximide. The cells were broken by glass beads and lysates were centrifuged at 4000 g for 3 min followed by clarification at 13 000 g for 10 min, 4 °C. Fifteen A260 units were loaded onto each linear 15­40% (w/v) or 5­30% (w/v) sucrose gradient (Biocomp, Gradient Master 105) in buffer A. Centrifugation was performed in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 38 000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, gradient profiles were obtained by measuring A254 (ISCO UA5 Absorbance Detector) with a density gradient fractionator (ISCO Model 185) and the data were processed by a Mac Integrator II (Rainin Instrument Co.). 3. Results 3.1. Construction and characterization of a TIF11 conditional expression system Previously we reported that TIF11 is essential for cell viability [8]. To test whether the essential function of eIF1A concerns protein synthesis in vivo, the conditional strain CM1 was used to deplete eIF1A. CM1 harbors a disrupted chromosomal TIF11 gene (tif11::HIS3) and carries a plasmid, pW-y1A, with wild type TIF11 under the control of the GAL promoter (figure 1B). Therefore TIF11 is expressed in galactose-containing media but is repressed in glucose-containing media. Generation times were measured for the CM1 and W303-1A (parental) strains grown in either YPG or YPD medium. As shown in figure 2, the doubling time in galactose for both strains is comparable, ca. 2.5 h. When the strains were shifted to glucose, W303-1A grew prior to saturation with a generation time of 1.5 h, whereas CM1 slowed after 2 generations to a doubling time of about 3 h, then slowed more dramatically after 4 to 5 generations following the shift. This is the expected behavior for an essential gene product that is depleted. To confirm depletion, lysates from CM1 harvested 12 h after shifting to glucose were analyzed by Western immunoblotting; no eIF1A was detected (results not shown). Normal growth rates, even after eIF1A levels were reduced due to two or three cell divisions, indicate that lower levels of eIF1A are capable of supporting rapid

Kainuma and Hershey tions. The prt1-1 mutant form is defective for promoting the binding of ternary complexes (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi) to 40S ribosomal subunits [17, 18]. When strain TP11B4-1 is grown at 25 °C, it shows a wild type polysome profile (figure 3A). However, when the strain is shifted to 37 °C for 30 min, almost complete run-off of ribosomes from polysomes is seen (figure 3B), as reported previously [19]. The run-off ribosomes accumulate primarily as `vacant couple' 80S ribosomes, some of which dissociate into 40S and 60S subunits. This type of polysome profile is typical when a translation initiation factor is depleted or inactivated. When eIF1A is depleted by growing CM1 in YPG and shifting to YPD medium for 3 to 4 generations, reduced polysomes and accumulation of 80S ribosomes also are seen (figure 3C, D). However, the effect of diminished polysomes and increased 80S ribosomes is not so severe as that seen with prt1-1 at 37 °C (figure 3B). Interestingly, there is an apparent decrease in the 40S peak and an increase in the 60S peak compared to the Prt1-inactivated profile. The phenomenon is more readily seen when parental and CM1 lysates are centrifuged longer, to better separate the ribosomal subunits (figure 4A, D). The results imply that depletion of eIF1A impairs initiation of translation but in a way somewhat different from inactivated eIF3. There are at least two explanations for the difference in the 40S/60S ratio. One possibility is that eIF1A is involved in 40S ribosomal subunit assembly. Therefore, in the absence of eIF1A, the amount of total 40S ribosomal subunits would decrease whereas free 60S subunits would appear to increase due to a shortage of 40S subunits. Another explanation is that the larger 60S peak may be due in part to formation of 40S ribosomal subunit dimers, since 40S ribosomal subunits show a tendency to associate into 55S dimers [20, 21]. To distinguish between these possibilities, the amounts of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits were measured in strains W303-1A and CM1 after shifting to glucose medium. Vacant 80S ribosomes not engaged in translation as well as free and/or aggregated subunits can be resolved into sharp 40S and 60S peaks by fractionation on high-salt sucrose gradients containing 0.5 M KCl (figure 4B, E) [22]. Because the two strains exhibit similar molar ratios of 40S to 60S subunits, we conclude that 40S assembly likely is not affected by eIF1A depletion. To evaluate whether or not 40S dimerization occurs in eIF1A-depleted cells, the presence of 40S ribosomal subunits in the 60S region of low salt gradients was investigated in two ways. First, gradient fractions were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization for the presence of 18S rRNA, diagnostic of 40S ribosomes. With the control strain, W303-1A, 18S rRNA was detected in the 40S and 80S regions of the gradient, but not in the 60S region (figure 4C). In contrast, only a low level of 18S rRNA was found in the 40S region of strain CM1 depleted of eIF1A (figure 4F), consistent with few free 40S

cell division and imply that the factor in wild type cells is present in excess. 3.2. Analysis of protein synthesis upon depletion of eIF1A Polysome profiles of the eIF1A-depleted strain CM1 were analyzed to test whether depletion of eIF1A impairs protein synthesis at the level of initiation or elongation. As a control for inhibiting initiation and altering polysome profiles, a cell extract was prepared from the prt1-1 temperature-sensitive strain, TP11B-4-1 [17], which was grown at permissive (25 °C) and non-permissive (37 °C) temperatures. The Prt1 protein is one of the subunits of eIF3, another initiation factor involved in multiple func-

Extracts were prepared from prt1-1 strain TP11B-4-1 exponentially growing in YPD medium at 25 °C (A) and 37 °C (B). Extracts for CM1 were prepared from cells growing exponentially in YPG (YPGal) (C) and at 12 h after a shift to YPD (YPGlu) medium (D). The extracts containing about 15 A260 units were centrifuged on 10­45% (w/v) sucrose gradients and analyzed as described in Materials and methods. The figure shows scans of absorbance at 254 nm. Sedimentation is from left to right and the sedimentation positions of 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits are indicated. The largest peak in each panel corresponds to 80S ribosomes as labeled in A.

ribosomes present in these cells (figure 4D). Instead, the 18S rRNA is abundant in both the 80S and 60S regions, indicative of the presence of 40S dimers. In a second test, ribosomal subunits sedimenting in the middle of the 60S region of the low salt gradients were concentrated and examined again, but this time with a high salt gradient. The material in the 60S peak from W303-1A generated mainly 60S particles, whereas that from the eIF1Adepleted strain generated appreciable 40S subunits in addition to 60S subunits (data not shown). The results demonstrate that depletion of eIF1A allows 40S ribosomal

subunits to aggregate into dimers sedimenting near 60S. However, how the implied binding of eIF1A to 40S subunits prevents their dimerization is not known. 3.3. Deletion analysis of eIF1A eIF1A is a conserved and highly charged acidic protein. The proteins from both yeast and mammals contain basic N-terminal domains (29% Lys + Arg in the first 42 residues of the human protein and 30% in the first 40 residues of the yeast protein) and acidic C-terminal domains (54%

Extracts prepared and analyzed as shown in A and D were fractionated into 15 fractions. The presence of 18S rRNA in the gradient fractions was determined by RNA blot hybridization analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the fractions and RNA pellets were resuspended in RNA sample buffer [27]. RNA gel preparation and Northern blot analysis were carried out as described previously [15]. Equal volumes of each fraction were electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Hybond N, and probed for 18S rRNA. Plasmid pBR322-EcoC containing a portion of 18S rDNA, kindly provided by Terri Kinzy (Rutgers University), was digested by EcoRI and the resulting 1.79 kb fragment was used as the probe.

Asp + Glu in the C-terminal 28 residues for humans and 54% in the C-terminal 37 residues for yeast) (figure 5A). These terminal regions appear to be unstructured and lie outside the core globular domains, as deduced by modeling yeast eIF1A to the human three-dimensional structure solved by NMR spectroscopy [11]. To determine the importance of these highly conserved charged domains, we constructed N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutations in eIF1A and monitored their ability to support cell viability and protein synthesis. Plasmids YEp51-1AC and YEp51-1AN, constructed as described under Materials and Methods, were designed to overexpress eIF1A-C and eIF1A-, respectively, from a GAL promoter on high copy number plasmids. Each truncated protein has a calculated mass of 14 kDa; eIF1A-C lacks 75% of the Asp + Glu rich region, and eIF1A- lacks 92% of the Lys + Arg rich region (figure 5B). After introduction of each plasmid into CM3 and curing of YCp50-TIF11, strains CM7 (for the C form) and CM9 (for the N form) were obtained (see Materials and methods for details) which express the truncated protein. In each case, the absence of YCp50TIF11 was confirmed, indicating that YEp51-1AC or YEp51-1AN is the sole source of the factor. Also as expected, strains CM7 and CM9 do not grow on glucosecontaining media (data not shown), as their GAL promot-

ers are repressed under these conditions. The growth of strains CM7 and CM9 on plates was tested at different temperatures, and compared with that of the parental strain (W303-1A) and an eIF1A-overproducing strain (CM4). All strains grew well at 30 °C, but CM9 grew more poorly at 37 °C and both CM7 and CM9 grew poorly at 39 °C (figure 6). The results show that neither terminal region is absolutely required for cell growth when the truncated forms are expressed from a galactose promoter on a high copy number plasmid. The temperature sensitivity, especially for CM9 encoding eIF1A-N, indicates an important role for these regions at higher temperatures. CM9 in YPG liquid medium shows a doubling time at 30 °C of 6.0 h compare to 2.0 h for strain W303-1A (figure 7A). eIF1A-N is present in CM9 cells at a level comparable to or only slightly below that of eIF1A in W303-1A cells (figure 7B) (see discussion of eIF1A-C below). Therefore the slow growth phenotype is due primarily to a reduction in factor specific activity, not to the apparently slightly diminished level caused either by loss of antibody epitopes or to degradation of the truncated protein. CM7 in YPG medium at 30 °C grew with a doubling time of 3.5 h, but eIF1A-C was not detected by Western immunoblotting with antibodies to human eIF1A (data not shown). This may be due to a loss of epitopes residing mostly in the negatively charged C-terminal

region, to a failure of the deleted form to fold properly (unlikely), or to rapid degradation of the truncated protein. As a consequence, we cannot attribute the slow growth phenotype of the eIF1A-C strain to a reduction in factor specific activity. To examine protein synthesis in cells expressing the N-terminal truncated form of eIF1A, extracts were prepared from strains W303-1A and CM9 and polysome profiles were analyzed. The profile from CM9 shows a major loss of polysomes and a large increase of the 80S peak relative to that from W303-1A (figure 7C, D), which indicates that the N-terminal truncation of eIF1A causes severe impairment of translation initiation. This reduced protein synthesis presumably is the cause of the slower growth rate. Analysis of strain CM7 also showed diminished polysomes, although the effect was less severe (results not shown).

eIF1A has been implicated in dissociating ribosomes into their subunits, promoting and stabilizing the binding of Met-tRNAi to 40S ribosomal subunits, scanning the 5'-UTR and recognizing the AUG initiation codon. Such functions have been identified and elucidated by in vitro studies with highly purified mammalian ribosomes and initiation factors. Here we demonstrate that yeast eIF1A is involved in the initiation phase of protein synthesis in vivo, since depletion leads to a reduction in the rate of initiation as deduced from polysome profiles (figure 3). Although we favor the view that the essential function of eIF1A is its direct involvement in the initiation pathway, it is possible that the effect on initiation upon eIF1A depletion is caused indirectly by decreased levels of free 40S subunits due to 40S dimer formation. Involvement in the initiation phase is confirmed by the effect on polysomes caused by deletion of the N- terminal domain of eIF1A. Expression of eIF1A-N as the sole source of eIF1A results in much smaller polysomes and hence a strong inhibition of initiation (figure 7D). Expression of eIF1A-C also results in temperature-sensitive growth (figure 6) and an increase in the ratio of 80S ribosomes to polysomes (data not shown). It is therefore likely that the essential role of eIF1A in the cell concerns its function as an initiation factor. A less parsimonious explanation that cannot be ruled out is that eIF1A affects cell proliferation by a pathway not related to protein synthesis, and the reduced growth rate in turn inhibits the initiation rate. The ratio of eIF1A to ribosomes is only 0.2 in mammalian cells [15]. Most mammalian initiation factors are present at a ratio of 0.5 or greater [23]. We have measured eIF1A levels in yeast by Western immunoblotting and obtained a value of 0.16 molecules per ribosome (unpublished results). Therefore eIF1A may be one of the least abundant of the initiation factors, suggesting that it could be a target of regulation. Prt1, a subunit of yeast eIF3, also is present at only 0.2 copies per ribosome [24]. In spite of the low level, eIF1A is not rate-limiting at physiological levels, as overexpression does not affect the growth rate of yeast cells (figure 6 and unpublished results). Furthermore, substantial depletion of eIF1A is required before an effect on cell growth becomes apparent (figure 2). A factor level of 0.16 per ribosome is sufficient to complex stoichiometrically with native 40S ribosomal subunits under most conditions, and certainly is sufficient if it functions catalytically through only a brief encounter with the initiating ribosome. The gradient analyses of eIF1A-depleted cells also demonstrate another in vivo function for eIF1A. In depleted cells, the native 60S ribosomal subunit peak is much larger than the 40S peak. A similar result was obtained when RP59, a protein responsible for 40S ribosomal subunit assembly, was depleted [25]. However, we have ruled out a decrease in 40S subunits and

Figure 7. Analysis of strain CM9 expressing eIF1A-N. A. Growth curves of W303-1A ( ) and CM9 (tif11::HIS3, YEp51-1AN) (v) were determined in YPG as described in the legend to figure 2. B. Western immunoblotting. Equal amounts of protein (30 µg) from clarified W303-1A (lane 1) and CM9 (lane 2) lysates were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE [28] and immunoblotting with anti-eIF1A antiserum as described previously [15]. eIF1A bands were detected with the Western-LightTM chemiluminescence kit (Tropix). C, D. Polysome analyses. Extracts were prepared from strains W303-1A (C) and CM9 (D) exponentially growing in YPG medium. The extracts were centrifuged on 10­45% (w/v) sucrose gradients as described under Materials and methods and were analyzed as described in figure 3. Absorbance scans are shown; the large peak near the center of each profile corresponds to 80S ribosomes.

demonstrated instead that the 60S peak contains 40S dimers. Since depletion leads to the formation of 40S dimers, one of the functions for eIF1A is to suppress the formation of such dimers. This might be accomplished by its binding in the A site of the 40S subunit, as observed with its bacterial homolog, IF1 [5]. Such binding could inhibit dimer formation either sterically or through induction of a conformational change in the subunit. Our results support earlier experiments wherein purified eIF1A pre-

vented 40S dimer formation and was required to convert inactive 40S dimers to 40S subunits active for Met-tRNAi binding [26]. 40S subunit dimers migrating near 60S have been detected in preparations of ribosomes [20], although their physiological role, if any, is obscure. If dimer formation in eIF1A-depleted cells occurs extensively in vivo, it could account for the inhibition of initiation seen, as insufficient levels of 40S subunits would be present to support rapid initiation.

514 It is surprising that deletion of either of the highly charged terminal domains of eIF1A generates a truncated protein that nevertheless is capable of sustaining cell growth. Deletion of the N-terminal domain causes a greater reduction of growth-rate at 30 °C (to 6 h doubling time) (figure 7A) compared to deletion of the C-terminus (to 3.5 h doubling time), and growth at higher temperatures is even more severely affected (figure 6). The reduction in polysomes seen with eIF1A-N (figure 7D) indicates a strong inhibition of initiation, likely the cause of the slower growth rate. Since the eIF1A-N protein is present in CM9 cells, the loss of function caused by deletion of the N-terminal region suggests that this region plays a crucial, though not essential, role in protein synthesis. It will be important to identify macromolecules that interact directly with the unstructured N-terminus of eIF1A. Strain CM9 may be useful in a screen to isolate suppressors of the slow growth phenotype, leading to the identification of other gene products involved in eIF1A activity. Acknowledgments
