The crystal structure of recombinant human dihydrofolate reductase with folate bound in the active site has been determined and the structural model refined at 0.2-nm resolution. Preliminary studies of the binding of the inhibitors methotrexate and trimethoprim to the human apoenzyme have been performed at 0.35-nm resolution. The conformations of the chemically very similar ligands folate and methotrexate, one a substrate the other a potent inhibitor, differ substantially in that their pteridine rings are in inverse orientations relative to their p-aminobenzoyl-L-glutamate moieties. Methotrexate binding is similar to that previously observed in two bacterial enzymes but is quite different from that observed in the enzyme from a mouse lymphoma cell line [Stammers et al. (1987) FEBS Lett. 218, 178-1841. The geometry of the polypeptide chain around the folate binding site in the human enzyme is not consistent with conclusions previously drawn with regard to the species selectivity of the inhibitor trimethoprim [Matthews et al. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 392-3991, Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; tetrahydrofolate

drofolate or folate to tetrahydrofolate in an NADPH-dependent manner. The enzyme is present in all dividing cells and maintains the level of fully reduced folate coenzymes, which are essential for the synthesis of thymidylate and other metabolites [I]. DHFR is the target enzyme for a number of clinically important drugs of which the antineoplastic agent methotrexate and the antibacterial agent trimethoprim are perhaps best known (see Fig. 1). For the purpose of rational drug design of novel antibacterial agents, knowledge of the structure of one or more representative bacterial enzymes as well as that of a mammalian DHFR, ideally from human cell line, is needed. The refined structures of a bacterial and an avian DHFR, from Escherichia coli and chicken liver respectively, have provided the basis for a detailed analysis of inhibitor selectivity, in particular of the remarkably higher affinity of trimethoprim for bacterial as compared to vertebrate DHFRs [2]. While this analysis has revealed important differences between the two classes of enzymes, the chicken and the human sequence are sufficiently different (overall homology 75%) that experimental determination of the structure of the human enzyme was considered necessary to provide a safer basis for drug design purposes. Very recently the refined structures of two ternary complexes of mouse L1210 DHFR, containing the cofxtor NADPH together with trimethoprim and methotrexate respectively, have been reported [3]. Although binding of methotrexate and trimethoprim to the human enzyme, as reported in this paper, has thus far only been studied by difference Fourier methods at moderate

resolution (0.35 nm), there are, somewhat surprisingly, distinct differences between these two mammalian enzymes, most notably in the side-chain conformation of the active-site residue Phe-31 and in the binding of methotrexate. Despite a wealth of stuctural information, the catalytic mechanism of DHFR is still poorly understood. It is unclear, for example, how protonation of N5 in the case of dihydrofolate and of N8 in that of folate reduction, thought to occur concurrently with or precede hydride transfer, takes place and how they are mediated by the essential Glu-30 (Asp in bacterial DHFR). The refined structure of the binary complex of human DHFR with folate represents the first DHFR structure with a substrate molecule bound in the active site. An accurate description of its interactions with the enzyme and of the location of nearby water molecules potentially important in catalysis is now available.

378 MATERIALS AND METHODS Crystallization Recombinant human dihydrofolate reductase was produced in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography as described by Stiiber et al. [4]. Elution of the enzyme from the methotrexate-Sepharose column was performed with folate, which cannot be completely removed without causing aggregation of the protein. Initial crystallization experiments in the presence of excess methotrexate and NADPH produced two crystal forms of the resulting ternary complex [4]. Crystals of the binary complex with folate were obtained by a batch-type crystallization procedure. A solution of the purified enzyme in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.0 at about 8 mg/ml concentration was precipitated in ammonium sulphate at 80% saturation. The supernatant, still containing 1- 2 mg/ml of protein, was left standing at room temperature in a sealed container. After several weeks rhombohedra1 crystals, up to 0.6mm along each edge, had grown out of this solution. They belong to space group R3 with a = 5.604 nm and c = 10.069 nm (or a = 8.629 nm, c = 7.698 nm for hexagonal indexing), have one copy of the binary complex in the asymmetric unit and diffract to about 0.17-nm resolution. Data collection and isomorphous replacement results For the initial structure determination, diffractometer data were collected to 0.3-nm resolution for a native and a mercury derivative crystal (24-h soak in 3.2 M ammonium sulphate, 1 mg/ml ethyl mercury chloride) and to 0.6-nm resolution for a uranyl derivative crystal (48-h soak in 3.2 M ammonium sulphate, 2.5 mg/ml uranyl acetate). The reflection intensities, including Friedel pairs for the derivative crystals, were measured at 3°C on a Nicolet P3 4-circle diffractometer equipped with an LT-1 cooling device using graphite monochromatized Cu-K, radiation. Full profiles of 3.5 'width were recorded in 96 steps, with scan speeds varying with the size of the crystal. The profiles were processed as described by Tickle [5] with 72 steps taken as peak and the remaining 24 used to estimate the background correction. The data were reduced by standard procedures including a semiempirical absorption correction [6] and a correction for radiation damage determined from the decay of 10 repeatedly measured reflections. lnterpretation of the isomorphous as well as of the anomalous difference Patterson for the ethylmercury derivative was straightforward in terms of one heavy atom site per molecule. The uranyl derivative was useful to resolve an ambiguity in the mercury position by comparison of the 0.6-nm difference Fouriers calculated with SIR/AS phases of the two possible mercury solutions. The correct choice produced five sites that could be verified in the uranyl difference Patterson but only noise peaks for the other choice. Because of the low occupancies of these sites and the significant non-isomorphism of this derivative it was not used for phase determination. The parameters of the mercury site were refined using the FHLE option of the CCP4 package heavy atom refinement program REFINE (x = 0.2516, y = 0.1360, z set to 0.0000 and B = 0.16 nm'). The overall figure of merit for all reflections to 0.3-nm resolution based on the isomorphous and anomalous differences of the mercury derivative was 0.70. A higher-resolution native data set to 0.2 nm was collected on a FAST area detector system at a test installation of Enraf Nonius in Delft. Ni-filtered radiation was used which was produced by an Elliott GX21 rotating anode generator run at

40 kV/90 mA with a 0.3-mm focal spot. The detector face was set at 50 mm from the crystal with a 8 offset angle of 25". The crystal was rotated around the $ axis (set parallel to the 8 axis) and data were collected over a total range of 122" recorded as frames of 0.1 and 50 s exposure time. Data processing and reduction was carried out using the MADNES software 171. The first 10" of rotation were repeated at the end and a radiation damage correction was derived from the strong remeasured reflections. The data set contains 90% of the independent reflections and has an overall R(sym) of 0.071 based on intensities. Diffractometer data to 0.35-nm resolution were also collected and processed as described above for a crystal soaked for 13 days in a solution containing 3.2 M ammonium sulphate and 90 pM methotrexate and for a crystal soaked for 15 days in a solution containing 3.2 M ammonium sulphate and 100 pM trimethoprim.

Interpretation of the electron density map and model building The 0.3-nm electron density distribution calculated with the SIR/AS phases allowed an unambiguous chain tracing and showed the location of most of the amino acid side chains. The weakest backbone density was observed in the exposed loop between residues Thr-40 and Lys-46, connecting a1 and BB. Density corresponding to the bound folate molecule was very well defined for the pterine moiety (actually one of the strongest features in the electron density), well defined for the p-aminobenzoyl moiety and the a-carboxylate group but rather weak for the y-carboxylate group. The initial model was built with the interactive graphics program FRODO [8]. Using its BONES option [9] the known backbone of the refined binary complex of DHFR from E. coli with methotrexate [lo] was made to fit the skeletalized electron density distribution of the conserved eight-stranded sheet structure of the human enzyme. Subsequent alignment of the remaining homologous structural elements to the corresponding electron density of human DHFR was straightforward. Insertion of extra residues in the human enzyme, occuring mainly in three loop regions far removed from the active site (see above), as well as the side chains of the known sequence of human DHFR [ l l ] completed the initial model. The conventional R factor based on the initial model (1529 non-hydrogen atoms, no water molecules) was 39.8% for a total number of 3390 reflections with Z > = sig ( Z ) in the resolution range within 1.0-0.3 nm. Refinement techniques The refinement of human DHFR was carried out using an FFT version of the restrained reciprocal space least-squares method of Hendrickson and Konnert (Priestle, personal communication) [12- 141. A total number of 107 refinement cycles reduced the crystallographic R factor to 18.9%. Manual rebuilding was carried out at four intermediate stages where the automated refinement had converged. Conventional difference Fourier syntheses with coefficients Fobs and Fcale were used for finding errors and locating solvent molecules, while unweighted 3FOhs 2FOhs 2FOb, and -Fobsmaps were used for checking and correcting the model. Unbiased Fobs- Fcalcdifference densities were calculated for the active-site region by removing the corresponding side chains and the substrate from the model. Water molecules were introduced at the third refinement stage after cycle 43 and refined with full occupancies. An overall temperature factor was used up to cycle 49,

at which stage all data up to 0.2-nm resolution were incorporated. The weighting parameters used for the stereochemical features were only slightly changed during the course of refinement and correspond to those given by Hendrickson [14]. A value of half of the average absolute difference between the observed and calculated amplitudes determined the weighting scheme of the structure factors up to cycle 19, after which it was made a function of resolution. The relative weighting between the stereochemical features and amplitudes was changed in favour of the stereochemistry during the last refinement cycles. Ideal stereochemical values of the substrate molecule were taken from a model of folate built from fragments of known structure as described by Miiller (151. Strong planarity constraints were applied to the following five folate substructures: (a) the pterine ring with the C6 substituent atom, (b) the phenyl ring with two substituent atoms, (c) the amide group (five atoms), (d) the a-carboxylate group and (e) the y-carboxylate group. RESULTS Generaljeatures of the refined model A skeletal drawing of the refined structure of human DHFR is shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the overall backbone folding of the human enzyme is very similar to that found for chicken liver [16] and mouse L1210 [3] dihydrofolate reductases. Table 1 lists the observed secondary structure elements assigned by applying the criteria of Kabsch and Sander ~71. The mean 3 values for 1497 protein and 32 folate nonhydrogen atoms are 0.181 nm' and 0.163 nm2, respectively. The prominent P-pleated sheet in the protein interior forms part of the rigid core of the enzyme ( ( B ) = 0.119 nm'). The thermal mobility increases for the exposed regions, particularly in the loop between Thr-40 and Lys-46 ( ( B ) = 0.376 nm') and in the surface helices a111 and IV ( ( B ) = 0.250 nm' and 0.414 nm', respectively). There is a sharp increase in thermal motion for the N-terminal valine residue which makes no hydrogen bonds and may be partly disordered. According to the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the purified protein, about 50% of the recombinant human DHFR contains an additional N-terminal methionine residue [4]. No density was observed that could be assigned to this half occupied residue. The refined model of human DHFR at 0.2-nm resolution includes 249 crystallographically independent water mol-

ecules with an average isotropic temperature factor of 0.383 nm'. In addition, two large electron density features were interpreted as sulphate ions (see below). 133 water oxygens are within hydrogen bonding distance of at least one nitrogen or oxygen atom of either the protein or folate. 60% of the remaining solvent sites belong to 55 water clusters ranging in size from 2 to 7 water molecules with a maximum acceptor-to-donor distance of 0.35 nm. Two bridging water molecules (0237 and 0247) make hydrogen bonds to the pterine moiety of folate and to active-site residues of the enzyme. They appear equivalent to the water molecules 253 and 201 in Lactobacillus casei DHFR which participate in methotrexate binding in both bacterial DHFR structures [lo]. As mentioned above, two sulphate ions are included in the solvent model. Both are located in the NADPH cavity and each is hydrogen-bonded to one main-chain nitrogen with distances of 0.269 nm (Thr-56) and 0.249 nm (Arg-77), respectively. Superposition of the refined L. casei DHFRNADPH-methotrexate ternary complex with the human enzyme unambiguously revealed that the positions of the sulphate ions S04-l and S04-2 correspond to those of the 2`and 5`-phosphate groups of the adenosine ribose moiety of the cofactor NADPH (see Fig. 3b). For both hydrogen bonds mentioned above, equivalent hydrogen bonds are present in the bacterial holoenzyme structure. S04-l is also within hydrogen-bonding distance of the hydroxyl of Ser-76 (0.29 nm) and S04-2makes an additional hydrogen bond with the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-56. For all hydrogen bonds

[16] for the avian DHFR-NADPHphenyltriazine ternary complex with the single exception of that to the niain-chain nitrogen of Arg-77. Although sulphate is present in 80-fold excess over phosphate in the crystallization buffer, full or partial occupancy of these sites by phosphate cannot be excluded.
Folute binding site

The binding of folate is illustrated in Fig. 3a; a 'partial' difference map for the folate molecule is shown in Fig. 4 (for details see figure legend). As can be seen, the molecule is bound with an almost planar arrangement of its p-aminobenzamide moiety which was not enforced by constraints (see Materials and Methods). This is the preferred conformation of this moiety in crystalline folk acid and in crystalline and enzymebound folic acid derivatives [18]. The molecule occupies an extended cavity located on one face of the central p sheet. Its surrounding is dominated by hydrophobic residues which belong to the a-helical segments a1 (Arg-28 -Thr-39) and a11 (Lys-54 - Ser-59), to the somewhat irregular part between Ser59 and Ile-71 and to the central p strands. Hydrophobic contacts are made with the bulky side chains of Phe-31 and Phe34 which cover one face of the pteridine ring. The Phe-31 side chain has torsion angles of -101" and -51" for x 1 and xz respectively which are both about 40" away from the nearest preferred values (- 60" and - 90' respectively). The unfavourable conformation of this side chain has been confirmed by inspection of unbiased difference Fourier maps. In addition, its mean isotropic temperature factor of 0.189 nm2 corresponds to the enzyme's overall mean temperature factor and does not indicate abnormal thermal mobility or disorder. The opposite side of the pteridine ring faces the central /3 strands and the binding site of the nicotinamide moiety ofthe cofactor, occupied by water molecules (0356, 0357, 0367) in this binary complex. Non-polar interactions occur with the side chains of Jle-7, Ala-9 and Val-115 and with some mainchain atoms of Val-8 and Ala-9. The aromatic ring of the p-aminobenzoyl moiety is located in another hydrophobic pocket, mainly formed by the side chains of residues Ile-60, Leu-67 and Phe-31. Folate is directly hydrogen-bonded to three hydrophilic residues. The carboxylate group of Glu-30 makes hydrogen

bonds to the 2-amino group and N3 with distances of 0.275 nm (OEl -N2) and 0.288 nm (OE2-N3) respectively. The a-amide group of Asn-64 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the carbonyl oxygen of the benzoyl group, and the guanidinium group of Arg-70, a highly conserved residue (Arg-57 in L. cusei and E. coli), forms a pair of hydrogen bonds with the a-carboxylate of the glutamate. The distances in this salt bridge in the refined model are 0.278 nm for NH1 (Arg)-02 and 0.281 nm for NH2 (Arg)-01. The guanidinium group makes additional hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Thr-38 (another conserved residue) and the carbonyl oxygen of Lys-68. These interactions rigidly orient the Arg-70 side chain in an otherwise hydrophobic environment. Other conserved active-site hydrogen bonds are made by Thr-136 to OEl of Glu-30 and to N3 of folate via an intervening water. This water molecule is conserved in all known DHFR structures and corresponds, for example to water 201 in L. cusei. The glutamate portion of folate is unambiguously defined in the unbiased difference Fourier synthesis (see Fig. 4) and appears no more mobile than surface-exposed segments of the polypeptide chain. The mean B value for the pterine and phenyl moieties is 0.111 nm2 and 0.109 nm2 respectively and increases to 0.250 nm2 for the a-carboxylate and to 0.283 nm2 for the y-carboxylate group. Neither Arg-28 nor Arg-32, both located on the protein surface, interact with the substrate's y-carboxylate which is in their immediate neighbourhood. Hydrogen bonds are, however, made to surface water molecules. Compared to methotrexate binding in all known structures (see Table 2), the pteridine ring of folate is in an inverse orientation and presents its opposite face to the cofactor binding site, from where an hydride ion will be transferred during catalysis. This is not unexpected, because of the known absolute stereochemistry of folate reduction, established by Charlton et al. [19]. Neither N5 nor N8 are hydrogen-bonded to the enzyme or to any water molecules. In agreement with the model for dihydrofolate binding proposed by Bolin et al. [lo] the carbonyl oxygen of Jle-7 (Leu-4 in L. cusei; Ile-5 in E. coli) is in close vicinity to N8 (0.35 nm), and is the obvious acceptor of a hydrogen bond from the N8-H group of bound 7,8-dihydrofolate. In the case of folate, the carbonyl group of Ile-7 is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-121 whose hydroxyl group makes another hydrogen bond to water molecule 0357 with distances of 0.26 nm and 0.27 nm, re-

spectively. N5, although not in direct contact with any water molecules, is close to a solvent channel at the surface of the molecule and appears much more accessible to water than N8. As mentioned before, 0 4 is within hydrogen bonding distance of water 0237, which appears to be involved in three more hydrogen bonds to Glu-30, N7 of Trp-24 and water 0220.
Size o the active-site cavity f

distances of structurally equivalent pairs of residues in the two enzymes. Corresponding numbers for the differences between these distances in the human and the E. coli enzyme are listed in Table 3. It should be noted that Table 3 of Matthews et al. [2] is based on the refined structure of the ternary complex of the chicken liver enzyme with NADPH and trimethoprim and the binary complex of E. coli DHFR with trimethoprim. Here the distances are taken from the binary complex of the human enzyme with folate and the binary complex of the E. coti enzyme with methotrexate. As is apparent from Table 3, the relative opening of this cavity with residues Ile-60 and Leu67 on one side and residues Glu-30, Phe-31 and Phe-34 on the other is much smaller than in the chicken liver and in the mouse enzyme [3]. Omitting Glu-30, the average of the four characteristic difference distances 67 - 31,67 - 34,60 - 31 and 60 - 34 (see Table 3) is 0.020 nm for the human enzyme but is 0.100 nm for the chicken [2] and 0.064 nm for the mouse structure [3]. The two difference distances 67 - 30 and 60- 30 are the largest in all three cases with an average of 0.142 nm, 0.118 nm and 0.052nm for chicken, mouse and human DHFR respectively. Because Glu-30 of the vertebrate enzymes is replaced by the smaller Asp side chain in the bacterial enzymes, larger difference distances involving C, of this residue may simply reflect the increased size of this side chain whose carboxylate group is fixed relative to other active-site residues by substrate or inhibitor binding.
Inhibitor binding

In the first detailed comparison of trimethoprim binding to a vertebrate and to a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase by Matthews et al. [2] it was noticed that residues on opposite sides of the active-site cleft were 0.15-0.20 nm further apart in the chicken liver as compared to the E. coli enzyme. This was documented by a table of differences between C,-C,

Preliminary models for the binding of trimethoprim and methotrexate to human DHFR were obtained by difference Fourier techniques at 0.35-nm resolution, using coefficients [3FOb,(complex) 2FCal,(enzyme)] calculated phases based and on the refined model. The difference maps clearly established that folate had been replaced by the corresponding inhibitor (see Fig. 5a, b). It was expected that methotrexate would bind as observed in other complexes (see Table 2) with its pteridine ring in the

Fig. 5. Stereo view o 3 I Fobs- I2FC,,, clifference densities at 0.35-nm resolution for methotrexate ( a ) and trimethoprim ( b ) . The phases used f I were obtained from a structure factor calculation with the final refined model omitting the folate molecule. The densities are contoured at 600 e/nm3. Note that in this kind of difference map, density is also present for the protein. The size of the density pdrdllelopiped has been chosen such that all (trimethoprim) or most (methotrexate) of the inhibitor density is displayed without obscuring the essential features by too much density. For this reason only part of the density of the Phe-31 side chain is visible and the density of the glutamate portion of methotrexate is outside the box chosen. Again the view is similar but not identical to that of Fig. 3c and d

384
inverse orientation compared to that in bound folate. Indeed, in this conformation a much better fit to the difference density could be achieved than with a folate-like conformation. In the preliminary model shown in Fig. 3c, the pteridine ring has been put into the density in such a way that hydrogen bonds can be made from its N1 nitrogen and its 2-amino group to Glu-30 and from its 4-amino group to the main-chain carbonyls of Ile-7 and Val-115. The geometry of these hydrogen bonds is not optimal, but shifts of the order of 0.02-0.03 nm in some neighbouring side-chain and main-chain positions appear sufficient to corrcct these small deficiencies. For trimethoprim, the difference density showed two large density features. Their shape is consistent with that expected for aromatic rings at this resolution. They are well fitted with a trimethoprim molecule that is bound in the same way as in the ternary complexes of the chicken liver and mouse holoenzymes, where the trimethoxybenzyl substituent is in the so-called `up' position [20]. Both inhibitor difference densities indicate small structural adjustments in the neighbouring polypeptide chain segments. Their confirmation and detailed interpretation have to await refinement with high-resolution data. There is, however, no indication of major movements of either the side chain of Phe-31 or that of Phe-34. in the first step of folate reduction and to N5 in dihydrofolate reduction. As seen in Fig. 3a neither N5 nor N8 are in direct contact with either Glu-30 or the conserved water 0237 which is hydrogen-bonded to Glu-30, N7 of Trp-24 and via another water (0220) to the bulk solvent. Certainly, 0237 appears to be in a strategic position to play an important role in the catalytic mechanism. Based on these structural results the only nucleophilic group of the pterine ring which is involved in hydrogen bonds connecting to the essential Glu-30 and to the bulk solvent is the 0x0 group. Theoretical studies [21] have shown that initial protonation at 0 4 has attractive features and cannot be ruled out. In the case of 7,s-dihydrofolate reduction, direct or water-mediated transfer of the proton to N5 after initial 0 4 protonation could take place before or after hydride ion transfer. The reduction of folate to tetrahydrofolate, typically 10 - 1000-fold slower than that of dihydrofolate, involves two hydride transfers from NADPH. Although no intermediates have been experimentally observed or characterized there are good reasons to assume that the first step is reduction to 7,s-dihydrofolate [24]. Model building of the ternary complex with NADPH, as described and illustrated in Fig. 3b, suggests that direct protonation at the deeply buried N8 position is difficult. Although 0 4 protonation appears less favorable in pterine as compared to dihydropterine [21], hydride attack at C7 is conjugatively assisted by the solvated 0x0 group. After hydride transfer, tautomerization of the resulting 4,7-dihydropterine to the more stable 7,s-dihydropterine would require that N8 becomes accessible to solvent molecules during replacement of the oxidized cofactor. While these considerations are speculative, Fig. 3b nicely illustrates that the hydrogen atom on the dihydronicotinamide ring is in an ideal position to attack C6 or C7 in bound dihydrofolate or folate respectively. The expected shortening of the N8 to O = C (Ile-7) distance of 0.35 nm for folate to about 0.28 nm for dihydrofolate might contribute to the optimal positioning of the hydrogen with respect to C6 rather than C7. Detailed inhibitor studies have been predominantly carried out with methotrexate and trimethoprim. The remarkable species selectivity of the latter [25], which is an important reason for its success as an antibacterial agent, calls for a structural interpretation in terms of differences in the activesite design between bacterial and vertebrate dihydrofolate reductases. An important result of the structure analyzes of the complexes of the E. coli and the chicken liver enzymes with trimethoprim was that the inhibitor binds in two different conformations with its trimethoxyphenyl group occupying different hydrophobic pockets designated the upper and lower clefts [20]. In the vertebrate enzymes the trimethoxyphenyl group occupies the upper pocket. In addition, the 4-amino group makes only one hydrogen bond in the complex with the chicken liver and the mouse enzyme compared with two in the bacterial enzyme. Taken together, the structural and biochemical data indicate that trimethoprim binding to the vertebrate enzymes, in the same way as observed for the E. coli enzyme, must be energetically very unfavourable. Matthews et al. [2, 261 have argued that the increased width across the cavity bounded by (a)II and (a)III in the chicken enzyme and the larger size of side-chain 31 (Tyr or Phe in vertebrate DHFR, Leu-28 in E. coli DHFR) are the main reasons that the trimethoprim side chain cannot be favourably accommodated in this lower cavity in the case of vertebrate dihydrofolate reductases. However, the increase of the width across this lower cavity is already smaller in the mouse enzyme [3] and is hardly significant in the structure of the human enzyme

DISCUSSION

A large amount of detailed structural information is available for dihydrofolate reductases of different origin from crystal structure analyses of a variety of complexes with inhibitors and cofactor (see Table 2). Amajor objective of these structure determinations was a better understanding (a) of the catalytic steps of the reduction process and (b) of inhibitor binding in general and of the remarkable species selectivity of trimethoprim in particular. Despite all the existing information, important aspects of these questions have remained unresolved. New and more accurate information relating to these issues is provided by the structure of the binary complex of human DHFR with folate. This is the first refined structure with a substrate rather than an inhibitor bound in the active site. A key question with regard to the catalytic events, and one where structural studies can be expected to suggest or rule out possible mechanisms, is how hydride transfer is assisted by the specific environment of the substrate in the active site. The generally accepted view is that protonation occurs concurrently with or precedes hydride transfer [21] and that the essential active-site residue Glu-30 (Asp in bacterial DHFRs) is involved in promoting this protonation. Kinetic and structural studies with mutated enzymes [22] are consistent with this view. The pattern of hydrogen bonds observed between the 2-amino-4-oxopyrimidine moiety of bound folate, the carboxylate of Glu-30 and the two water molecules 0237 and 0247 has been correctly predicted by Bolin et al. [lo] and Matthews et al. [23] in a schematic model of the binding of dihydrofolate. In this model, an additional hydrogen bond that can be formed by dihydrofolate but not folate is present between N8 and the main-chain carbonyl group of Ile-7. In the complex with folate the observed distance from N8 to the carbonyl oxygen is 0.350 nm and only minor structural adjustments appear necessary to accomodate dihydrofolate in place of folate and to form this additional hydrogen bond. A proton must ultimately be transferred from solution to N8
