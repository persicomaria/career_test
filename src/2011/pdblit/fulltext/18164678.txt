The bacterial enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP) catalyses the phosphorolysis of an a-1,4-glycosidic bond in maltodextrins, removing the non-reducing glucosyl residues of linear oligosaccharides as glucose1-phosphate (Glc1P). In contrast to the well-studied muscle glycogen phosphorylase (GP), MalP exhibits no allosteric properties and has a higher affinity for linear oligosaccharides than GP. We have used MalP as a model system to study catalysis in the crystal in the direction of malto° dextrin synthesis. The 2.0 A crystal structure of the MalP/Glc1P binary complex shows that the Glc1P substrate adopts a conformation seen previously with both inactive and active forms of mammalian GP, with the phosphate group not in close contact with the 50 -phosphate group of the essential pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) cofactor. In the active MalP enzyme, the residue Arg569 stabilizes the negative-charged Glc1P, whereas in the inactive form of GP this key residue is held away from the catalytic site by loop 280s and an allosteric transition of the mammalian enzyme is required for activation. The comparison between MalP structures shows that His377, through a hydrogen bond with the 6-hydroxyl group of Glc1P substrate, triggers a conformational change of the 380s loop. This mobile region folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the specific recognition of the oligosaccharide and to the synergism between substrates in promoting the formation of the MalP ternary complex. The structures solved after the diffusion of oligosaccharides (either maltotetraose, G4 or maltopentaose, G5) into MalP/Glc1P crystals show the formation of phosphate and elongation of the oligosaccharide chain. ° ° These structures, refined at 1.8 A and at 2.2 A, confirm that only when an oligosaccharide is bound to the catalytic site will Glc1P bend its phosphate group down so it can contact the PLP 50 phosphate group and promote catalysis. The relatively large oligosaccharide substrates can diffuse quickly into the MalP/Glc1P crystals and the enzymatic reaction can occur without significant crystal damage. These structures obtained before and after catalysis have been used as frames of a molecular movie. This movie reveals the relative positions of substrates in the catalytic channel and shows a minimal movement of the protein, involving mainly Arg569, which tracks the substrate phosphate group.

Utilization of maltodextrins by Escherichia coli requires relief of catabolite repression of the mal genes. These genes encode proteins involved in the transport and metabolism of maltose and maltodextrins and are regulated by a classic cyclic AMP/catabolite-activator protein system.1 They include the gene for maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP), an enzyme that catalyses the phosphorolysis

of linear maltodextrins to yield glucose-1-phosphate (Glc1P). The enzyme readily catalyses the reverse reaction of Glc1P plus oligosaccharide to yield an oligosaccharide lengthened by one glucose residue and liberation of inorganic phosphate. The equilibrium constant (phosphate/Glc1P) is 3.6 in favor of the reverse reaction but in the cell the reaction is driven in favor of Glc1P production because of the high concentration of phosphate and the immediate utilization of Glc1P in metabolism. The sequence of E. coli MalP is 46% identical with the mammalian glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and nearly 100% identical at the catalytic site.2,3 In comparison to the mammalian GP, MalP is a simpler enzyme. It is regulated neither by allosteric effectors nor phosphorylation and it is expressed in E. coli as a constitutively active enzyme.4 A structural explanation for the activity without allosteric regulation has been provided by the crystal structure of E. coli MalP and comparison of this structure with the mammalian GP structures in their inactive (GPb ) and active (phosphorylated) (GPa ) states.5 MalP has a relatively high affinity (mM) for linear oligosaccharides, in contrast to GP, which

prefers the branched-chain glycogen polysaccharide.6,7 This feature has been exploited to achieve a MalP phosphorylase/maltopentaose complex that demonstrated the critical interactions important for oligosaccharide bound at the phosphorylase catalytic site.8 It allowed the formation of a ternary enzyme complex with a thio-pentasaccharide (GSG4) and phosphate to mimic the ternary enzyme/substrate complex seen in the reverse physiological reaction. The crystal structures of oligosaccharide bound across the catalytic site in both the binary and the ternary MalP enzyme/substrate complexes answered a long outstanding question about phosphorylase recognition of oligosaccharide substrate.8 These structures revealed the importance of the conformational change in the oligosaccharide substrate in the formation of ternary complexes and provided support for the role of the 50 -phosphate group of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in catalysis. Crystallographic studies on rabbit muscle GPb with Glc1P, in both the less active T-state and in the active R-state, showed that the phosphate group of Glc1P did not contact the cofactor 50 phosphate group in the binary complex directly.9,10 In

isotope-exchange experiments, no significant isotope exchange in Glc1P was observed with GPa in the absence of glycogen, consistent with the view that only in the ternary complex is Glc1P aligned correctly for catalysis.11 It was suggested that the binding of oligosaccharide to the catalytic-site channel was necessary in order to promote the reactive conformation of Glc1P in which there is a direct contact between the substrate and cofactor phosphate groups.12 In the complex between GPbT-state and a transition-state analogue, heptulose 2-phosphate (H2P), a direct hydrogen bond between the H2P phosphate group and the 50 -phosphate group of PLP was observed.13 The presence of a methyl group in the b-position on the C1 atom of the pyranose moiety in the H2P inhibitor promotes a conformation of the H2P phosphate group such that it contacts the PLP 50 -phosphate group. The proximity of the two negatively charged phosphate groups found in the binary GPb/H2P complex is stabilized by an arginine residue, Arg569, which shifts from a site buried in the protein characteristic of the T-state, to a position where it can make contacts with the substrate phosphate group. Here, we report the crystal structures of MalP in complex with Glc1P, and with Glc1P and oligosaccharide in order to understand the role of the protein and the role of the oligosaccharide in pro° moting catalysis. The structure at 2.0 A resolution of the MalP/Glc1P binary complex shows that the 380s loop, whose role is associated with the binding of maltodextrin substrate,8,14,15 is located in a closed conformation suitable for the specific recognition of an oligosaccharide substrate. We used these crystals of the binary MalP/Glc1P complex as a starting point for studies of enzymatic catalysis in the solid state in order to follow the reaction in the direction of oligosaccharide synthesis. Oligo-

saccharide substrates maltotetraose (G4) and maltopentaose (G5) were soaked into crystals of the MalP/Glc1P complex. Kinetic analysis in solution has shown a rapid-equilibrium, random bi ­ bi reaction in which the rate-limiting step is the interconversion of the ternary enzyme/substrate complex.16 The X-ray structures presented here show that catalysis had taken place in the crystal within the time available for diffusion of the large substrate into the protein crystal to yield the product oligosaccharide and phosphate.

Results and Discussion
X-ray structure of the MalP with bound Glc1P The structure of the MalP with the substrate Glc1P bound in the catalytic site was determined using monochromatic synchrotron radiation. ° Data to 2.0 A resolution were collected from the co-crystals of MalP/Glc1P complex at 100 K at the Elettra synchrotron, Trieste. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the native MalP structure as the search object. The statistics for data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 1. The structure of MalP/Glc1P consists of a homodimer of 796 residues per single chain, each having a PLP cofactor covalently linked to the protein through the 1-amino group of lysine 680 (using the rabbit muscle GP numbering), a Glc1P substrate, a Tris molecule (used as buffer) and a total of 1235 water molecules. The final model has a reasonable stereochemistry and all non-Gly residues fall within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, except Lys568 (F ¼ 1658; C ¼ 1748) and Asp339 (F ¼ 618; C ¼ 2 1678). These are key residues at the catalytic site. Lys568 contacts the 50 -phosphate group of the

PLP cofactor. Asp339 lines the oligosaccharide channel and contacts the exogenous Tris molecule. The overall architecture of the protein is similar to the previously determined MalP structures. Figure 1(a) and (b) shows a ribbon diagram of the dimeric structure of this a/b protein, viewed normal to and along the pseudo 2-fold axis relating two monomers. The quaternary structure, with C2 symmetry, is stabilized by intermolecular contacts involving the central region known as the tower helix. This region is important, because it mediates the allosteric transition between the active R-state and less active T-state in the mammalian GP

enzyme. Figure 1(c) shows the structure of the monomer and demonstrates the cleft between the N-terminal and C-terminal domain that is the binding site of the substrates and the PLP cofactor. Figure 2(a) shows the electron density map in the vicinity of the catalytic site of the MalP/Glc1P complex. Glc1P is firmly bound and exhibits low thermal B-factors (Table 1). A Tris molecule is located adjacent to the Glc1P and hydrogen bonds to the 1-phosphate group of Glc1P. The pyranose ring of Glc1P is in the chair conformation (Table 2) and occupies the sub-site 2 1, using the nomenclature reported by Watson et al.8

Enzymatic Catalysis in Crystals of MalP

The Tris molecule occupies the next site, sub-site þ 1. The position of the phosphate group relative to the glucopyranose ring is similar to that reported for complexes of Glc1P with mammalian GP. The torsion angle F (O5­ C1 ­ O1 ­ P) is 1378 and may be compared with values of 1528 for GPb-T-state/Glc1P complex9 and 1298 for GPb-Rstate/Glc1P complex,10 and is close to the value of 1358 found in the calculated minimum energy conformation of Glc1P in vacuo.9 In this conformation, a hydrogen bond is formed between the phosphate group and the O2 hydroxyl group. The Glc1P substrate forms a large number of hydrogen bonds with the enzyme but does not contact the co-factor directly (Figure 2(a)). The hydrogen bond between ND1 of His377 side-chain and the hydroxyl O6 of the Glc1P substrate is of interest because His377 is the first residue of a mobile region designated as the 380s loop (residues 377­ 384). This loop in the closed conformation folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the recognition and correct positioning of the oligosaccharide in the MalP/ oligosaccharide complexes. In the MalP native structure5 and in the MalP/acarbose complex,15 the loop adopts an open conformation (Figure 3(a)). In the present binary complex, the 380s loop adopts a close conformation similar to that observed for the MalP/oligosaccharide complexes, although no oligosaccharide has been introduced into the structure. Sub-site þ 1 is occupied by a Tris molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of Asp339 and His341. Thus the combination of Glc1P at sub-site 2 1 and Tris at sub-site þ 1 has promoted a conformation that is typical of the active conformation ready to accept an oligosaccharide substrate. Arg569 is a key residue at the catalytic site that helps neutralize the close approach of the co-factor 50 -phosphate group to the substrate phosphate group. In the MalP/Glc1P complex, the distance ° between the two phosphorus atoms is 6.6 A and the shortest O ­O distance between the two phos° phate groups is 4.3 A. The 50 -phosphate group of the PLP cofactor is stabilized by a lysine residue, Lys568. Glc1P does not form a direct hydrogen bond with the 50 -phosphate group of PLP, although there is an interaction through water of the glycosidic oxygen atom to the 50 -phosphate group. In the inactive conformation of GPb in complex with Glc1P, Arg569 is swung away from the Glc1P phosphate group and access to the catalytic site is blocked by the 280s loop, a loop of chain that connects the tower helix to helix 8 (Figure 3(b)). Despite the fact that in the active MalP the 280s loop is folded so as to allow access to the catalytic site and Arg569 is in its productive conformation ready to stabilize the close approach of the 50 -phosphate group of the cofactor and the substrate phosphate group of Glc1P, the two phosphate groups do not approach each other sufficiently closely to promote catalysis. A further incentive is needed, in agreement with kinetic data, in order to form a productive enzyme substrate. We

therefore investigated the addition of oligosaccharides to the MalP/Glc1P binary complex. X-ray structures of the MalP with the products of enzymatic catalysis Crystals of the MalP/Glc1P binary complex were soaked for 20 minutes with 100 mM solutions of oligosaccharide substrates maltotetraose (G4) and maltopentaose (G5). Data were collected at 100 K ° with a resolution limit of 1.8 A for substrate G4 ° and 2.2 A for substrate G5. The final R-factors (Rfree) are 0.186 (0.216) and 0.197 (0.243) for G4 and G5, respectively (Table 1). The overall architecture of the protein in the oligosaccharide complexes is very similar to that of the isomorphous MalP/ Glc1P structure. The electron density map at the catalytic site of the binary complex soaked with G4 shows the presence of phosphate, presumably arising from dephosphorylation of Glc1P. In the catalytic channel, instead of the expected five glucose units, which would be anticipated from the reaction Glc1P þ G4 ! PO4 þ G5, only four glucosidic monomers have been localized in the sub-sites (þ 1, þ 2, þ 3 and þ 4). The most internal sub-site 2 1 is occupied by five water molecules.

These solvent molecules, forming a hydrogen bond network, are positioned in the sites previously occupied by the oxygen atoms of the glucosidic unit of Glc1P (Figure 2(b)). The sA-weighted 2Fo 2 Fc electron density map and the low thermal factors for substrates (Table 1) indicate that both oligosaccharide and phosphate are bound with high occupancy. The maltodextrin helix of the G4 oligosaccharide follows the catalytic tunnel and emerges at the surface of the enzyme at sub-site þ 4. The binding of oligosaccharide to MalP is dominated by stacking glucosyl/tyrosyl interactions at sub-sites þ 2 (Tyr280) and þ 4 (Tyr613) and by hydrogen bonds of the peripheral hydroxyl groups of sugar with the protein (Figure 4). The oligosaccharide adopts a structure that resembles the minimum free energy conformation in which the 2-hydroxyl group from one glucopyranose ring forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the 3-hydroxyl group of the adjacent glucopyranose. The phosphate group forms hydrogen bonds with both 50 -phosphate groups of the PLP cofactor and with O4 of the glucose unit located in sub-site þ 1 (Figure 2(b)). It contacts the side-chains of Arg569, Tyr573 and Lys574, the main-chain N of Gly135, and Leu136 and four water molecules.

Figure 5. Superimposition of the substrates Glc1P, MalP/Glc1P soaked in G4 and MalP/Glc1P soaked in G5 at the catalytic site of the three structures.

The electron density maps at the catalytic site of the structure resulting from the soaking of the MalP/Glc1P complex with G5 show a phosphate anion and five oligosaccharide moieties bound across the catalytic site starting from the first 2 1 site (Figure 2(c)). However, the phosphate anion is ° not well defined (overall B-factor of 61 A2). A similar disorder of the anion substrate was observed in the structure of ternary complexes MalP/GSG4/P, ° where the overall B-factor was 60 A2,8 and in a MalP/G5/SO4, where the overall B-factor was ° 55 A2 (unpublished results). In contrast, the phosphate group in the native MalP structure (overall ° B-factor 34 A2)5 and in the structure obtained by soaking MalP/Glc1P with G4 (overall B-factor ° 20 A2) is very well defined. The disorder of the phosphate anion found in the MalP/GSG4/P structure was explained as a result of its proximity to the "unnatural" thio linkage of the oligosaccharide.8 The present results show that a phosphate anion does not fit comfortably in this site when a natural substrate occupies sub-site 2 1. No significant movement of the protein residues in the catalytic site after enzymatic reaction was observed, with the exception of the small shift in Arg569 that follows the shift of the phosphate group from Glc1P to inorganic phosphate ° (P­ P distance 1.8 A) (Figure 5). This shift provides additional support for the presence of the phosphate group in the ternary complex. In the present structures, the torsion angles about the glycosidic bonds between the sugar residues in sub-sites þ 1, þ 2, þ 3 and þ 4 are similar to those observed in the previously reported oligosaccharide MalP complexes,8 in which there are O2/O30 intramolecular hydrogen bonds. The torsion angles about the glycosidic linkage between the sugar

residues in sub-sites 2 1 and þ 1 exhibit a nonstandard geometry that is necessary in order to allow the sugar to bind in sub-site 2 1. There is rotation of about 2 608 around the O40 ­ C40 torsion angle, C, and a rotation of about 2 308 around the C1 ­ O40 torsion angle, F, that breaks the intramolecular O20 /O30 hydrogen bond between the first two glucosidic units. The conformation is similar to that observed previously in the G5 and the GSG4/P complexes.8 The presence of phosphate at the catalytic site in both these oligosaccharide soak experiments indicates that catalysis has taken place. It is surprising, therefore, that we do not observe elongation of the oligosaccharide (G4 to G5 or G5 to G6). The extra sugar molecule would be expected in an additional sub-site þ 5. This sub-site is on the surface of the enzyme where there are few opportunities to make strong interactions with the protein. In support of the likely existence of a disordered sugar residue in sub-site þ 5, we note that the electron density maps indicate that the configuration of the reducing sugar in sub-site þ 4 is in the a configuration and not the expected b configuration, which is the more favored configuration for a terminal glucose residue (Figure 6). From this result, we suggest that this hydroxyl group is not the reducing end of the oligosaccharide chain but there is at least another a-1,4 glycosidic link. These experiments show that the relatively large oligosaccharide substrates (G4, 666 Da; G5, 829 Da) can diffuse into the crystals and that the enzymatic reaction can go almost to completion, as evidenced by the disappearance of Glc1P and formation of phosphate, without significant crystal damage. Furthermore, the structures demonstrate that the malto-oligosaccharide can bind in two different modes. In one mode, which is observed in the experiment with G5, the non-reducing

terminal glucosyl residue is bound in sub-site 2 1 in a position suitable for phosphorolysis. In the other mode, which is observed in the experiment with G4, the terminal residue is bound in sub-site þ 1 in a position that allows it to act a glucosyl acceptor during synthesis. The differences in oligosaccharide positions observed in the two experiments are intriguing but may be explained by the following observations. The presence of phosphate at the catalytic site results in a tension with the sugar in sub-site 2 1. This is seen by the very short hydrogen bond distance between the phosphate group and the oxygen atom of the glycosidic ° bond (2.2 A) in the MalP/Glc1P complex soaked with G5. This tension and the energy required to achieve the unusual glycosidic torsion angles between the sugar residues in sub-sites 2 1 and þ 1 can be compensated by the interactions of the oligosaccharide with the enzyme. The interactions made in sub-site þ 4, where there is stacking between the sugar residue and the conserved Tyr613, make significant contributions. Model building suggests that a sugar residue with an a configuration is preferred in this site. The hydrophobic C ­H group of the a anomeric carbon atom faces the phenolic ring, and this configuration allows a stronger CH/p interaction of the sugar residue with the tyrosine residue than a b configuration (Figure 6). The electron density maps indicate that the incubation of MalP/Glc1P with G4 and G5 has resulted in G5 and G6 oligosaccharides, respectively, but that the reducing terminal oligosaccharide is not located in the density and does not make contact with the enzyme. This interpretation places an a sugar residue in sub-site þ 4 in both experiments. However, were the incubation of G4 with MalP/Glc1P to have placed G5 in subsites 2 1, þ 1 to þ 4 then a b sugar residue would be placed in sub-site þ 4 and would be less favorable in compensating the conflict between the phosphate group and the sugar residue at sub-site 2 1. Hence, in this experiment, sub-site 2 1 is not occupied and the oligosaccharide occupies subsites þ 1 to þ 5 with an a sugar residue in sub-site þ 4 and the sugar residue in sub-site þ 5 not localized.

Catalytic mechanism The GP and MalP enzymes have been the subject of intense biochemical and crystallographic studies.8,9,12,13,17 These data led to the proposal of a two-step mechanism for the catalysis of the glycogenolysis process.8,12,13 In the first step, the 50 -phosphate group of the PLP cofactor promotes a general acid attack by the inorganic phosphate on the glycosidic oxygen atom, leading to cleavage of the glycosidic C1 ­O bond and formation of a carbonium/oxonium ion transition state. In the second step, nucleophilic attack by the inorganic phosphate on the carbonium/oxonium ion leads to formation of the product Glc1P with retention of configuration. In the reverse reaction (Figure 7), lengthening of the oligosaccharide by addition of the glucosyl moiety of Glc1P to the non-reducing end of the maltodextrin chain with concomitant production of phosphate, the first step is a proton transfer from the 50 -phosphate group of PLP to the phosphate group of Glc1P that promotes the cleavage of the C1 ­ O bond and formation of a carbonium/oxonium ion transition state. The reaction is completed by the attack of the O4 hydroxyl group of the incoming oligosaccharide on the carbonium/oxonium ion intermediate, which is assisted by the PLP 50 -phosphate group acting through the inorganic phosphate. The present results show that in the absence of oligosaccharide, Glc1P does not alter the conformation of its linkage between the glucose residue and its phosphate group from that observed in the minimum free energy structure in order to contact the 50 -phosphate group of the PLP. However, in the presence of oligosaccharide, catalysis takes place and the resulting product, inorganic phosphate, does contact the 50 -phosphate group. The structures obtained after enzymatic catalysis in the crystal reveal the relative positions of substrates in the catalytic channel. Figure 5 demonstrates the difference between the phosphate group of Glc1P observed in the MalP/Glc1P complex and free phosphate observed in the oligosaccharide complexes. In order to stabilize the reaction product, the Arg569 side-chain follows the phosphate anion. Figure 5 illustrates the ease with which the phosphate group of Glc1P can approach the 50 -phosphate group of PLP by a rotation about the C1 ­ O bond encouraged by the sugar residue in sub-site þ 1. The relative position of the Glc1P and the oligosaccharide obtained from G4 is consistent with a nucleophilic attack from the O4 hydroxyl oxygen atom of the non-reducing end of maltodextrin on the C1 carbon atom of the gluco° sidic unit of Glc1P (the O4 ­ C1 distance is 2.1 A). However, this direct attack is hampered by the proximity of the phosphate-leaving group (the ° O4 ­ P distance is 1.8 A; the O4 ­O1P distance is ° 1.7 A). This suggests that the phosphate group should leave the C1 carbon atom, with the formation of a carbonium/oxonium ion transition state, before the nucleophilic attack of the oligo-

saccharide and that the sugar interacting with the phosphate groups of Glc1P acts as "primer" for the dephosphorolysis reaction of Glc1P. For the formation of the elongated oligosaccharide, only a small adjustment of the orientation of the glucosidic group in the sub-site 2 1 and a small shift of the other glucosidic units is necessary in order to make the new glycosidic bond with retention of configuration (Figure 5). X-ray crystallographic studies cannot prove the existence of an unstable intermediate. The three-dimensional structures presented here represent thermodynamically stable structures obtained in several steps of the enzymatic pathway. They have allowed us to draft a molecular movie on the basis of experimental data that gives an idea of how the enzyme works.

Materials and Methods
MalP expression and purification MalP was obtained from the expression strain E. coli DmalA518 harboring the plasmid pMAP101 and purified as described.18,19 Crystallization Crystals of the binary complex Malp/Glc1P were obtained by co-crystallization experiments using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method. Single crystals of the complex grew from drops containing 2.0 ml of a 6.0 mg/ml protein solution, 0.4 ml of 100 mM Glc1P (Sigma Aldrich) solution and 1.6 ml of well solution (27% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.1 M LiCl, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5 at 291 K). Optimized crystallization trials produced rectangular plate-like crystals in four to five days with typical dimensions of about 1000 mm £ 200 mm £ 10 mm. The crystals were extremely fragile and sensitive to slight changes in temperature and mother liquor, and decomposed quickly even with gentle manipulation. Crystals were harvested into mother liquor containing 15% (v/v) methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) as cryoprotectant with a small loop of fine rayon fiber and flash-frozen in a stream of N2 at 100 K prior to data collection. A further crystal form was obtained in the presence of higher concentrations of PEG 4000 (30%, w/v) and 0.5 M LiCl. This second crystal form had a prismatic morphology with typical dimensions of about 300 mm £ 300 mm £ 50 mm. Enzymatic reaction in the crystal Two different substrates, maltotetraose (G4) and maltopentaose (G5) (Sigma Aldrich) were used for the enzymatic catalysis in crystals of the binary complex Malp/Glc1P. The enzymatic reaction in the crystal was performed by soaking a solution (2 ml) obtained by mixing equal volumes of substrate solution (100 mM G4 or 100 mM G5) and the well solution was added to the drop (about 2 ml) where the crystals of MalP/Glc1P had grown. This drop contained a large excess of Glc1P (about 20 mM). After 20 minutes of soaking time, the crystals were passed quickly through a solution of  http://www.units.it/ceb/malp_movie.html

Enzymatic Catalysis in Crystals of MalP

mother liquor containing 15% cryoprotectant MPD and 15 mM substrates Glc1P and G4 or G5 and flash-frozen at 100 K prior to data collection. X-ray data collection and processing X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at the Elettra Synchrotron Light Source, Trieste, Italy. A com° plete data set to 2.0 A of resolution was collected using ° a monochromatic radiation with wavelength of 1.000 A and a MAR Research 345 mm imaging plate detector from a single crystal of the binary complex MalP/Glc1P. A crystal of MalP/Glc1P soaked with G5 substrate was ° used for the collection of data to 2.2 A resolution using ° with the MAR 345 image plate a wavelength of 1.200 A ° detector. A data set at 1.8 A resolution from a crystal MalP/Glc1P soaked with G4 was collected using a wave° length of 1.200 A and an MARCCD area detector. The crystals of the binary complex MalP/Glc1P belong to the space group P212121 with unit-cell dimen° ° ° sions a ¼ 74.83 A, b ¼ 105.28 A and c ¼ 218.62 A. This crystal form is similar to that obtained for the MalP/G5, MalP/GSG4 and MalP/acarbose complex crystals grown under similar conditions.8,15 Data were processed using MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 program suite.20,21 A summary of data collection procedures and crystallographic statistics for the binary MalP/Glc1P complex and for the two crystals of MalP/Glc1P soaked with G4 and G5, respectively, is given in Table 1. The ° crystals of the second form diffracted poorly (3.0 A resolution) and were found to correspond to a C2 cell similar to the previously reported MalP/maltose complex.14 Structure determination The structure of MalP/Glc1P was solved with REFMAC22 using as starting coordinates the isomorphous structure of MalP/GSG4 complex with substrates removed. A random subset of data (5%) was omitted from all refinement calculations to provide an assessment of the progress of refinement. Rigid-body refinement of the two polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit gave an R-factor of 0.31. The Glc1P substrate was then easily located in an initial difference Fourier electron density map. The model was further refined using REFMAC. The NCS restraints were strong for the two crystallographically independent protein molecules and for the water molecules related by pseudo symmetry. The NCS restraints for specific amino acid side-chains were released when large differences in conformation between the two independent units were detected in the Fourier maps. Restrained positional and thermal factor refinement with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints improved the R-factor and Rfree to 0.265 and 0.298, respectively. A subsequent difference Fourier map clearly revealed the presence of a Tris molecule near the Glc1P substrate in the catalytic site. Rebuilding of the model and location of solvent atoms were based on the analysis of sA-weighted23 (2Fo 2 Fc) and (Fo 2 Fc) maps and were performed on Silicon Graphics workstations using the program O.24 The final R-factor and Rfree are 0.180 and 0.220, respectively. A similar refinement strategy for the complexes obtained by soaking the MalP/Glc1P crystals in G4 and G5 led to final R-factor (Rfree) values of 0.186 (0.216) and 0.197 (0.243), respectively. The high quality of the electron density maps, especially that obtained from the ° 1.8 A resolution map with the ternary complex with G4,

indicated a different assignment of three contiguous amino acid residues in the primary sequence. The sequence changes involve residues 261­ 263 (E. coli numbering scheme) located in the important 280s loop. These sequence changes were not observed in the previous MalP structures and differ from the primary sequence reported in sequence databases. The assignment (with the previous assignment in brackets) is Ala261 (His), Phe262 (Tyr), Glu263 (Ala). In rabbit muscle GP, the corresponding residues are Phe285, Phe286 and Glu287. Two of the three residues are conserved in the two isoenzymes, while the important Phe285 residue, that with Tyr613 forms the nucleosideinhibitor site in GP, is replaced by Ala and not by an aromatic His residue. The model quality was checked with PROCHECK.25 Protein Data Bank accession numbers Atomic coordinates and structure factors of MalP/ Glc1P binary complex (1L5V) and of ternary complexes obtained from MalP/Glc1P crystals soaked with G4 (1L5W) and with G5 (1L6I) have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank.
