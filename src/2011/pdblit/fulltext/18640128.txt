Specific Recognition of Saturated and 4,5-Unsaturated Hexuronate Sugars by a Periplasmic Binding Protein Involved in Pectin Catabolism
D. Wade Abbott and Alisdair B. Boraston
Biochemistry and Microbiology, University of Victoria, PO Box 3055 STN CSC, Victoria, BC, Canada V8W 3P6 The process of pectin depolymerization by pectate lyases and glycoside hydrolases produced by pectinolytic organisms, particularly the phytopathogens from the genus Erwinia, is reasonably well understood. Indeed each extracellular and intracellular catabolic stage has been identified using either genetic, bioinformatic or biochemical approaches. Nevertheless, the molecular details of many of these stages remain unknown. In particular, the mechanism and ligand binding profiles for the transport of pectin degradation products between cellular compartments remain entirely uninvestigated. Here we present the structure of TogB, a 45.7 kDa periplasmic binding protein from Yersinia enterocolitica. This protein is a component of the TogMNAB ABC transporter involved in the periplasmic transport of oligogalacturonides. In addition to the unliganded complex (at 2.2 Å), we have also determined the structures of TogB in complex with digalacturonic acid (at 2.2 Å), trigalacturonic acid (at 1.8 Å) and 4,5unsaturated digalacutronic acid (at 2.3 Å). The molecular determinants of oligogalacturonide binding include a novel salt-bridge between the nonreducing sugar uronate group, selectivity for the unsaturated ligand, and the overall sugar configuration. Complementing this are UV difference and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments that highlight the thermodynamic basis of ligand specificity. The ligand binding profiles of the TogMNAB transporter complex nicely complement pectate lyase-mediated pectin degradation, which is a significant component of pectin depolymerization reactions.

Introduction
Polysaccharide degradation is typically achieved by enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycosidic linkages; however, a smaller group of enzymes, broadly termed polysaccharide lyases, that are active upon charged polysaccharides harness a unique -elimination mechanism to achieve a simAbbreviations used: CBM, carbohydrate binding module; CE, carbohydrate esterase; digalUA, digalacturonic acid; KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; GH, glycoside hydrolase; trigalUA, trigalacturonic acid; unsatdigalUA, 4,5-unsaturated digalacturonic acid; PL, pectate lyase; polygalUA, polygalacturonic acid.

ilar effect. The products generated by these enzymes have 4,5-unsaturated bonds at their non-reducing ends. Polysaccharide lyases are often found in bacterial pathogens that infect animals and plants, where they degrade host glycosaminoglycans or pectins, respectively, to liberate energy and achieve tissue destruction. Importantly, this process allows further spread of the organism within the host tissue. In particular, targeting pectin for destruction is an especially devastating process for plants as this polysaccharide fortifies plant cell walls by anchoring the major structural elements together. Indeed, the soft rot-causing Erwinia sp. employ a battery of polysaccharide lyases that depolymerize pectin, ultimately resulting in plant tissue maceration. As the main target of the Erwiniae is potatoes, the world's fourth largest crop, this incurs enormous costs to the agricultural industry (e.g. the US

Much of the research on pectinolysis by plant pathogens has been focused on secreted enzymes, and consequently the understanding of this process from genetic to structural levels is substantial. In Erwinia sp. there are two main extracellular branches to pectin degradation, which initially involves either pectin lyase or carboxyl esterase activity. Pectin lyases are active directly on methylated and acetylated polygalacturonic acid (polygalUA). Alternatively, the esterified substituent groups are first hydrolyzed by dedicated pectin de-methylases and de-acetylases. The processed polygalUA backbone is the optimal substrate for pectate lyases and glycoside hydrolases. These two pathways work in concert to depolymerize pectin, generating oligosaccharides varying in length. Transport into the periplasm is facilitated through an anionic specific monomeric porin, KdgM, which does not show conserved homology to any other porin of known structure.1,2 Detailed biochemical knowledge of downstream processes such as oligalacturonic acid transport and further catabolic processing within the confines of the bacterial cell are still poorly understood. Comparative genomics have yielded the most insight into this process. For example, using such approaches a pectin degrading system has been discovered in a number of enterobacterial species, including Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. pestis, and Salmonella typhimurium; and two Vibrio sp.3 This pathway contains a small complement of enzymes and carbohydrate binding proteins that are highly conserved between the plant pathogens (E. cartovora and E. chrysanthemi) and Yersinia sp. (Figure 1). These proteins include a family 32 carbohydratebinding module (sghX/CBM32) (also conserved in V. vulnificus), a family 28 exo-polygalacturonase (pehX), a family 2 pectate lyase (pelY/PL2A) (also conserved in V. vulnificus), and the multicomponent periplasmic transporter, TogMNAB complex (also conserved in Klebsiella pneumoniae).3­5 All of these genes are under selective repression of KdgR, a transcriptional repressor that recognizes the KdgR element and is allosterically activated by its inducer metabolite 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG).3,6,7 From a structure-function perspective, the TogMNAB complex is of particular interest. This is a CUT1 class ABC transporter that displays an archetypical superstructure comprised of two transmembane domains (TogM and TogN), and two cytoplasmic ATPase domains (TogA2) that couple the hydrolysis of ATP to the accumulation of substrate within the cell (Figure 1). TogB is a periplasmic ligand-binding protein that performs the first step in transport by selectively binding oligogalacturonides and delivering them to the TogMNA2 transport complex.4,5,8,9 In bacteria containing the TogMNAB complex, oligogalacturonide transport appears to be partially redundant as an electrochemically driven transporter, TogT, is also present. However, the TogMNAB complex, and particularly TogB, plays a key role in

Figure 1. Model of periplasmic polygalacturonic acid degradation within Y. enterocolitica. Polygalacturonic acid enters the periplasm through the outer membrane KdgM porin where it interacts with CBM32. The retained substrate is then acted upon by either YePL2A or YeGH28 to produce unsaturated and saturated oligogalacturonides, respectively. These solutes are preferentially bound by TogB, the specificity determinant for the TogMNAB transporter. Accumulation of oligogalacturonides within the cytoplasm is accompanied to ATP hydrolysis.

the chemotactic response to oligogalacturonides, which is ultimately thought to impact the virulence of the bacterium. TogB holds a relatively unique position among periplasmic solute binding proteins as it is predicted to specifically recognize an oligohexuronate ligand, a property only shared by the unrelated alginate binding protein.10 Furthermore, genetic studies suggest that unsaturated oligogalacturonides, such as those that would be produced by pectate lyase activity, are the strongest inducers of a chemotactic response implying that TogB may be additionally selective for unsaturated ligands.4,5 Using a structural and biophysical approach to address this hypothesis we show here that TogB from Y. enterocolitica is selective for digalacturonic acid with a preference for the 4,5-unsaturated form of this sugar. The X-ray crystal structures of TogB reveal the basis of its specificity for galacto-configured hexuronic acids and, in particular, suggest a key role for a salt-bridge in the recognition of oligogalacturonides. This specific class of noncovalent interactions is very rare in protein carbohydrate interactions in general and, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that it has been observed in a non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding protein. Overall, this work presents the first detailed study of an uncharacterized class of hexuronate

761 ligands for TogB. In support of this hypothesis, there was no observable interaction between this protein and polygalUA using affinity electrophoresis (Figure 2(a)). To characterize the selectivity of TogB for oligogalacturonides we determined the association constants of digalUA, trigalUA, and 4,5-unsatdigalUA using UV difference titrations and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Of the three ligands tested, trigalUA was the largest and yet displayed the lowest association constant. (Figure 2(b), Table 1). This observation is not that surprising, however, because trigalUA is a characterized substrate for two described periplasmic enzymes in Y. enterocolitica, YePL2 and YeGH28 12 and several exo-depolymerases in E. chrysanthemi.11,13,14 The products of these two enzymes consist almost exclusively of

Results and Discussion
Characterization of TogB­oligogalUA interactions The presence of a TogMNAB complex in Erwinia sp. and Yersinia sp. appears to correlate with the presence of periplasmic family 2 pectate lyases.11­14 This prompted us to investigate if the oligogalacturonide products of these enzymes are the natural

The specificity of TogB for galUA with varying degrees of polymerization was determined using several different biophysical techniques. (a) Affinity gel electrophoresis in the absence (lanes 1­3) and presence (lanes 4­6) of 0.4% polygalUA. The negative control used in this experiment was BSA (lanes 1 and 4) and the positive control was YeCBM32 (lanes 3 and 6). The retardation of YeCBM32 in lane six is indicative of its preferential and strong interaction with highly polymerized galUA (unpublished results).

digalUA with and without a 4,5-unsaturation at the non-reducing end, the latter of which is a result of pectate lyase-catalyzed -elimination. When disaccharide ligands are compared with the association constant of trigalUA, they bind with an increased order of magnitude with a threefold higher affinity for the unsaturated disaccharide than its saturated counterpart (Figure 2(b), Table 1). In order to quantify the thermodynamic properties behind the differences in affinity for the saturated and unsaturated disaccharides we measured the released heats of interaction by ITC. The disaccharides produced excellent binding isotherms that were reproducible and as expected strongly indicated a 1:1 binding stoichiometry (Figure 2(c), Table 1). For both the saturated and unsaturated disaccharides, complex formation is an enthalpically driven process, which is commonly observed in protein­carbohydrate interactions.15­18 The unsaturated digalUA product displayed a threefold increase in affinity for TogB compared to its saturated counterpart. A comparison of the energetic components reveals that the - 0.63 kcal/mol improvement in the Gibb's free energy (G) for the unsaturated versus saturated ligand comes by virtue of a - 5.1 kcal/mol improvement in the change in enthalpy (H) but a partially offsetting -15.2 cal/mole entropic penalty. The specificity of TogB for the unsaturated derivative is in good agreement with the product profile that is generated during pectin catabolism. Although pectinolysis is a concerted process, involving carbohydrate esterases, glycoside hydrolases and pectate lyases, the majority of depolymerization reactions are the result of -eliminations. Indeed, pectate lyases are considered to be the chief virulence factor in Erwinia sp. infections.7,19 Having a transport system dedicated for the preferential shuttling of unsaturated products therefore provides an optimal system for accumulating intracellular pectin metabolites. TogB structure In order to provide a structural rationale for the specificity of TogB we crystallized and solved the three-dimensional structure of TogB in an apoconformation, and in complex with digalUA, trigalUA, and 4,5-unsatdigalUA. The overall structure of

TogB is highly reminiscence of other Class II described periplasmic binding proteins. This class of proteins display N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains that are separated by a threestranded hinge region, each of which contains two symmetrical groups of five -strands (Figure 3(b)).51 In the unliganded or "open" conformation, these two domains are orientated away from each other, exposing the binding site at the interface between the N and C-terminal domains. The two domains of TogB are different in size with the C-terminal portion constituting about two-thirds of the protein's total molecular mass. The N-terminal domain consists of five short -helices that are folded upon each other, and three parallel strands. The larger C-terminal domain has a more complex structure that comprises a separate globular domain and an extended loop that feeds back into and exits from the N-terminal domain at two distinct positions, both of which are components of the hinge region. The C-terminal globular region displays nine -helices, and four short antiparallel -sheets. The extended loop consists of one short strand that packs with the parallel -strands from the N-terminal domain, and three short -helices that contribute to a portion of the top surface of the protein. TogB-oligogalUA complexes A defining characteristic of periplasmic binding proteins is their mechanism of binding. In the presence of ligand this class of proteins collapses about their hinge regions in a "venus-flytrap"-like mechanism to sequester the ligand. Consistent with other described solute binding proteins, TogB complexes completely internalize the ligand, leaving it inaccessible to bulk solvent. Superimposition of the open and closed conformations of TogB highlights the structural changes undergone by the protein during binding events. By comparing the spatial position of helix 1 in the presence and absence of trigalUA, the structural change spans a distance of  13.1 Å (Figure 3(b)). This isomerisation is characterized by two order parameters: the hinge angle () and the twist angle ().20 The hinge angle refers to the degree of opening between the centres of mass of the N and C-terminal domains. The twist angle is defined as the dihedral angle

763 rate approaching diffusion-limits. 23 Following [A]open[L] complex formation, the protein closes primarily along the hinge angle vector, which is followed by a sharp transition towards a twisting movement to form the [A]closed[L] complex.20,22 The closed conformation is stabilized by the enthalpic binding energy contributions of specific protein­ ligand interactions20 (Figures 4 and 5). Importantly, the two protein conformations are representative of the most common forms found in solution, as this process occurs in an equilibrium that is provoked in either direction by the presence or absence of ligand (see further comment below). The superimposition of TogB in complex with digalUA, trigalUA and unsatdigalUA, reveals that the protein incorporates the three ligands within the binding site without significant perturbations to the overall topologies. The three models overlaid with an rmsd value of 0.282 Å and 0.289 Å for the unsaturated ligand with trigalUA and digalUA, respectively, and 0.216 Å for the two saturated carbohydrates. Surprisingly, the greatest differences were observed between the unsaturated

formed between the N-terminal domain, hinge region and C-terminal domain centres of masses when the hinge domain is fixed in line with the Nterminal domain. The overall transition between the closed and open conformations, which has been described as a "single continuous curve", is dictated by the bond positioning and their corresponding degrees of freedom within the hinge region.21 More recently, this continuous curve appears to be best fit to a model that incorporates a two-step mechanism.22 The initial step involves ligand [L] binding to the acceptor protein [A] in its open state. This process occurs very rapidily as the exposed binding site enables ligand association at a

ligand and its saturated counterparts. This suggests that even though there is a much lower association constant for the trigalUA in comparison with digalUA, it is still well accommodated within the binding site. Molecular determinants of oligogalacturonide binding specificity Upon interaction with ligand, the binding energy contributed to the system shifts the conformational equilibrium towards the closed structure. For the purposes of further understanding this process and, in particular, the molecular determinants that drive ligand selectivity in oligogalacturonide transport, we have dissected the binding site of the protein into three subsites. Subsite one (N = 1) interacts with the non-reducing end of all three carbohydrates; subsite two (N = 2) binds the reducing residue of the disaccharides and the middle

sugar of trigalUA, and subsite three (N = 3) is occupied with the reducing sugar of trigalUA and ordered water molecules in the disaccharide complexes (Figures 4 and 5). Binding subsite 1 is located within a deep pocket at the interface between the two domains of TogB (Figures 4 and 5). W269 provides the main structural platform of this subsite as its apolar surface aligns with the plane of the pyranose ring of the galUA residue in what is often described as a stacking interaction (Figure 5(d)). In addition, putative Hbonds are formed between K305 and the equatorial O3, and the indole ring nitrogen of W35 with either the uronate group or the ring oxygen of galUA. It is difficult to determine the optimal binding pair from the structure, as both H-bonds are at a distance of approximately 3.1 Å, and with equally satisfactory geometries. Ligand specificity appears to be determined in part by the side-chain hydroxyl of S271, which forms an exclusive hydrogen bond with the

The Three-dimensional Structure of TogB

765 sugars is in contact with ordered water molecules with one oxygen forming a water-mediated H-bond network with D388. Other interactions at this site include a direct contact between the equatorial O2 and O3 and the primary amine group of K275. In the disaccharide complexes Y276 also interacts concomitantly with the O3 (2.5 Å) (Figures 4 and 5). In addition to the above-described polar interactions, the planar -face of C3­C5 forms a hydrophobic interaction with W67 (Figure 4(d)). Unlike the nonreducing sugar interactions within subsite 1, there is no electrostatic contact at this position. Although TogB tolerates the formation of a complex with trigalUA, the affinity is substantially lower in comparison to the disaccharides. Analysis of subsite 3 for interactions with the reducing sugar of trigalUA reveals a number of distinct molecular differences that may explain this process (Figures 4(c) and 5(c)). Firstly, in the disaccharide complexes this subsite is mainly hydrated and contributes to water-mediated H-bonding with the disaccharides, which are disrupted by the occupation of the trisaccharide. The contributions of water molecules to the binding energy in these circumstances may be more favorable. Secondly, trigalUA binding induces several conformational changes and perturbs two direct hydrogen bonds with TogB. The most noticeable of these energetic penalties are the repulsion of E187 at the reducing end of the binding pocket, and a conformational shift in Y276 (Figure 4(c)). This later event spans a distance of 1.5 Å, disrupting the Y276­O2 H-bond observed for the disaccharides. Importantly, however, the lack of available thermodynamic information for trigalUA due to its low affinity makes it difficult to assess any penalties incurred during these rearrangements. Overall, the specific protein­carbohydrate interactions in TogB provide little selectivity for galactoconfigured sugars. Indeed, the hydrogen bond networks in subsites 1 and 2 interact with equatorially configured O3 and O2 groups, respectively, while ion pairing in subsite 1 selects for the C5uronate group. In light of this observation, the main determinant of selectivity for oligogalacturonides appears to be the structural configuration of the glycosidic bond. The -1,4-linkage (i.e. linkage between two axial groups) imparts a sharp bend to the oligosaccharide whereby the planes of the pyranose rings in adjoining sugar residues are disposed at nearly right angles (Figure 5(d)). The topological landscape of the binding site and sidechain positioning therefore complement this distinctively configured sugar to provide the observed specificity. Comparison with other carbohydrate-specific periplasmic binding proteins An amino acid sequence similarity search using TogB identifies homologs in Yersinia sp., Erwinia sp., Enterobacter sp., Marinomonas sp., and Reinekea sp., all of which have no less that 60% amino acid sequence

uronate group of unsatdigalUA (Figures 4 and 5). Interestingly, no hydrogen bond donating or accepting groups were adequately positioned to interact with the O4 of digalUA or trigalUA (unsatdigalUA lacks an O4 entirely), an observation that explains how both the saturated and unsaturated ligands are accommodated (see below). A key interaction in all of the ligand studies is the formation of a salt-bridge between the uronate group of the non-reducing sugar and the guanidinium group of R40 (Figures 4 and 5). These two ionizable groups possess two different extremes in pKa and therefore would be attractive under normal conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a direct electrostatic interaction between a sugar and a periplasmic binding protein. Such interactions may be common for charged sugars and provide inherent selectivity over other closely related neutral sugars. In agreement with this hypothesis, galactose does not display any appreciable affinity for TogB (data not shown). An analysis of the specific protein­ligand interactions at subsite 1 provides some insight into the aetiology of the differences in binding energetics that were observed for digalUA and unsatdigalUA by ITC. The enthalpic gains observed for the unsaturated ligand relative to the saturated ligand appear to be due to the formation of a novel hydrogen bond between S271 and the uronate group of usatdigalUA. This exclusivity is likely generated by its unique pyranosyl ring conformation (Figures 4(b) and (e) and 5(b)). Creation of the terminal 4,5-unsaturated sugar via -elimination converts the C4 into a trigonal planar conformation. This alternate form influences the structural positioning of the C5-uronate group, which becomes geometrically and spatially poised for a potential hydrogen bond with the side-chain of S271 (at a distance of 2.6 Å). In comparison, the uronate groups from the saturated disaccharide and trisaccharide ligands are not positioned in close enough proximity or with satisfactory geometries for a similar interaction. The entropic differences observed between the two disaccharide complexes may result from the desolvation of the digalUA non-reducing end O4. The axial hydroxyl group of the saturated ligand is nestled into a tight hydrophobic pocket created by W35, A307, and the aliphatic portions of the Q308 side-chain. Hydroxyl group insertion would result in the return of ordered water molecules solvating the O4 back to bulk solvent. Importantly, any entropic gains due to this process would not occur during the formation of the unsaturated complex due to the definitive absence of O4. However, the enthalpic contribution of unsaturated ligand binding appears to be sufficient to overcome such entropic penalties and generate the measured improvement in binding free energy. Subsite 2 is occupied by the reducing sugar of both disaccharide complexes and the middle sugar residue of trigalUA. The C5-carboxylate for all three

766 identity with one another. The next closest relative has only  30% amino acid sequence identity. Among the close TogB relatives, the amino acid residues identified as important in ligand recognition are absolutely conserved. In contrast, the distantly related homologs (those with 30% amino acid identity or less), contain few to none of the ligand-binding residues. Overall, this suggests a strong clustering of evolutionarily related oligogalacturonide-specific periplasmic binding proteins. Although periplasmic binding proteins in general have a similar overall structure and operate by a similar mechanism of binding,20,22,24 the process of ligand specificity and selectivity is not as straightforward as it would seem. Superimposition of the TogB-digalUA complex with the structurally related carbohydrate-specific periplasmic binding proteins (ribose (1DRK, rmsd: 4.2 Å), trehalose (1EU8, rmsd: 3.1 Å), chitin (unpublished, rmsd: 4.2 Å), alginate (1Y3N, rmsd: 3.8 Å), and maltose binding proteins (3MBP, rmsd: 2.8 Å) reveals that the general positioning of the binding sites is similar (Figure 6). However, there is a noticeable diversity in three-dimensional orientations of the bound sugars (Figure 6). With this observation in hand it is perhaps not surprising that there are few to no sequence or structurally conserved amino acids that create these binding sites (not shown). This observation supports our growing understanding that subtle changes in sugar ligand configuration demand a high level of binding site distinction and complexity, even among closely related classes of carbohydratebinding proteins. Biological implications of TogB-mediated oligogalacturonide transport Erwinia sp. produce two periplasmic enzymes, an exo-pectate lyase and exopolygalacturonase, that depolymerise polygalUA to produce disaccharides.11,13,25,26 The importance of these enzymes is supported by the fact that pectinolytic members of

The superimposition of ligands reveals that although periplasmic binding proteins have a similar overall structure and mechanism of binding, there are substantial differences in the position of the binding site within the protein and the trajectory subsites.

Enterobacteraciae contain homologs.3,12 This suggests a need in Erwinia sp. and other Enterobacteria for the machinery to transport these disaccharide products. Indeed, in two earlier studies, the TogMNAB complex was predicted to be specific for the intracellular transport of saturated and unsaturated oligogalacturonides based upon genetic knockouts and feeding experiments.4,5,27 The biophysical and structural data presented here provide the first evidence at the molecular level for the function of TogB. The observed hierarchy of oligogalacturonide binding, trigalUA<digalUA<unsatdigalUA agrees well with the biology of pectin catabolism. TrigalUA and longer oligogalacturonide products of pectin breakdown are substrates for the periplasmic enzymes PL2A and GH28.26 The products of these reactions are undigalUA and digalUA, respectively, which are bound by TogB and ultimately transported by the TogMNA machinery. Upon entering the cell, these disaccharides are directly funnelled into the dedicated intracellular catabolic pathway for oligogalacturonic acid utilization. Importantly, for trigalUA molecules that do leak through into the cell there is also a cytoplasmic family 2 exo-pectate lyase that catalyzes the formation of a galUA monosaccharide and unsatdigalUA.26 The high affinity of TogB for the degradation products of PL2A and GH28 not only facilitates the intracellular accumulation of metabolites for energy generation, but also combats the inhibitory effects of product inhibition on the depolymerases. The preferential binding of unsaturated disaccharides to TogB is rationalized by the fact that there are high levels of this carbohydrate being produced due to the activity of upstream pectate lyases, in particular PL2A. Pectate lyases have been identified as the primary depolymerization factors in pectin degradation and are responsible for the majority of tissue destruction Erwinia sp. infections.7,19 Indeed, the activity of the periplasmic exopolygalacturonase on polygalUA substrates is less efficient and is therefore more attributable to a "clean-up" role as this protein is unable to macerate plant tissue on its own.12 Based upon these product profiles it appears highly efficient to develop a transport system that is fine-tuned for the shuttling of the most abundant metabolites being generated during pectin catabolism. Although the biological ramifications of plant cell wall destruction by the phytopathogens E. chyrsantehmi and E. carotorva have been extensively studied, the purposes behind pectin utilization by the human enteric pathogens from Enterobacteraciae remain more cryptic. Possibly this system enables these microorganisms to scavenge dietary pectic substates within the gastrointestinal tract. Alternatively, the observation that Y. enterocolitica can directly colonize plant material suggests that pectin utilization might be important for environmental persistence or for animal infection through a vegetative vector. Further biophysical information that moves towards solving some of the mysteries surrounding pectinolysis by Gram-negative enteric pathogens is forthcoming.

Affinity electrophoresis Affinity electrophoresis was performed as described.32,33 Briefly, the affinity of TogB for highly polymerized forms of galUA was tested using 10% polyacrylacmide gels polymerized with and without 0.4% polygalUA. Samples were electrophoresed for 2 h at a constant voltage of 100 Vat room temperature in 25 mM Tris-base (pH 8.8), 0.2 M glycine in a XCell SureLock Mini-cell system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). UV difference UV difference titrations were performed using methods identical to those described.33 All runs were executed at 20 °C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl (TogB required this salt condition for solubility during the reaction). Maximal absorbance shifts from three different wavelengths were determined by subtracting the trough from the peak values and correcting for dilution effects. Binding affinity was determined with a one-site binding model accounting for ligand depletion using MicroCal Origin (v.7.0) and assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry. The reported data are averaged calculated values with standard deviations from three individual experiments. Isothermal titration calorimetry Titrations were performed as described.33,34 TogB was dialyzed exhaustively against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaCl. All sugar ligands, previously exchanged into distilled water then lyophilized, were resuspended in the same buffer collected following dialysis of the protein. Titrations were performed in a VP-ITC (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). TriGalUA and digalUA concentrations were determined by mass. The unsatdigalUA concentration was determined both by mass and UV absorbance at 232 nm ( = 5200 mol- 1). TogB concentration was determined by UV absorbance as described above. Reaction conditions were: 6.1 mM digalUA titrated into 410 M TogB (C-value 8) and 1.92 mM 4,5-unsaturated digalUA titrated into 110 M TogB (C-value> 20).35 For analysis of the energetic properties of binding, the data were fit to a one-site binding model using Microcal Origin® (V7.0383, Northhampton, MA). Data processing and refinement Computing was done using the CCP4 suite36 unless otherwise stated. Diffraction data were collected with a Rigaku R-AXIS IV+ area detector coupled to a MM-002 X-ray generator with Osmic "blue" optics and an Oxford Cryostream 700. Data were processed using Crystal Clear/d*trek.37 Water molecules were added using the ARP/wARP38 option within REFMAC39 and inspected visually prior to deposition. In all TogB data sets, 5% of the observations were flagged as "free"40 and used to monitor refinement procedures. Manual model building was performed using COOT 41 and refinements using REFMAC. All data collection, processing, and final model statistics are given in Table 2. Data collection, phasing and refinement of TogB-GalUA complexes TogB at 20 mg/ml in complex with digalUA, trigalUA (Sigma, Oakville, ON) and 4,5-unsatdigalUA at 2.0 mM

Materials and Methods
Gene cloning, and protein production and purification The gene sequence of Y. enterocolitica TogB was determined by BLAST searching the Y. enterocolitica genome using the Y. pestis homolog as a query (NCBI ID: FLH0130347.01X). The full-length TogB polypeptide is a predicted 432 amino acid residue protein with an Nterminal secretion tag that was detected using the SignalP algorithm.28 Primers were designed to exclude residues 1­25 from the gene construct (5:CATATGGCTAGCGCGCAGGATGAAGTTAAT; 3:GAATTCCTCGAGTTAACGCATAGCGCGTTTCAG) and used to amplify a 1221 bp fragment from Y. enterocolitica genomic DNA (Sigma, Oakville, ON, ATCC® Number: 9610DTM). All molecular biology techniques were performed as described.29 Briefly, the DNA fragment was cloned into the pET28A 6× histidine-tag expression vector (Novagen, La Jolla, CA no. 69864-3) using directional 5 NheI and 3 XhoI restriction sites, and transformed directly into BL21 DE3 (pLysS) expression cells (Novagen, La Jolla, CA no. 69388). Gene expression was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at a cell density of 0.8 A at 600 nm and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Protein purification was performed following cell lysis in a French Press Cell, followed by clarification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described.29 Fractions containing pure protein were pooled and concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon, Beverly, MA) using a membrane molecular weight cutoff of 5 kDa (Filtron, Northborough, MA). At this stage, protein for UV difference and ITC experiments was used directly; TogB samples for crystallizations were treated with thrombin to remove the 6× His-tag further and purified by gel permeation chromatography using a Sephacryl 200 FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences, Pitscataway, NJ). Pure protein was concentrated as described above to a concentration of  70 mg ml- 1 (1.5 mM). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance with an extinction coefficient of 90,300 M- 1 cm- 1 (1.955 mg ml- 1) as predicted by the protparam analysis tool.30 Production of 4,5-unsaturated digalUA Unsaturated oligogalacturonides are not commercially available. Therefore, in order to characterize the binding properties of these ligands, we generated our unsaturated digalUA by enzymatic digestion of polygalUA and purification of the product. 25 ml of 0.2% polygalUA (Sigma, Oakville, ON) was digested overnight with 0.45 mg of purified YePL2B exopolygalacturonate lyase at 22.5 °C in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) (unpublished results). Digested product was purified by gel permeation chromatography in sdH2O using Sephadex G-25 (17-003102 GE Bio Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and monitored at 254 nm (the 4,5-unsaturated bond absorbs UV maximally at 232 nm).31 Fractions containing substantial amounts of purified unsaturated carbohydrate were pooled and lyophilized. Product was weighed and resuspended in sdH2O at a concentration of 2 mM (FW = 352.3) and analyzed on a Dionex carbohydrate amperometeric detection system (Dionex, Westmont, IL) with a carbopac PA20 column (no. 060142).  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Y_enterocolitica/  http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP

were crystallized in 35% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.6). For both the liganded and unliganded protein, hanging drops were set up by mixing 1.0 l of protein with an equal volume of mother liquor. Crystallization occurred via vapor diffusion. Under optimized conditions, crystals grew overnight. X-ray diffraction data of the underivatized TogB-trigalUA complex was collected at 113 K by freezing the crystal directly in the cryo-stream without any additional cryoprotection. Upon completion of the data collection, the same crystal was thawed and soaked for  30 min in 45% PEG 4000, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.6) containing 1 M NaI and mounted directly in the cryo-stream, again without any additional cryo-protection. Using both anomalous and isomorphous signal we found several iodide sites with ShelxD,42 which were used for phasing by SIRAS with SHARP.43 Refinement of seven partially occupied iodide sites using data to 2.8 Å yielded isomorphous phasing powers of 1.00 and 0.93 for centric and acentric reflections, respectively, and an anomalous phasing power of 0.71. Figure-of-merits (FOM) were 0.24 and 0.26 for centric and acentric reflections, respectively. Solvent flattening with an optimized solvent content of 45% was used to improve and extend the phases to 2.55 Å and resulted in a FOM of 0.65. ARP/wARP44 was able to correctly build roughly 35% of the backbone. This was manually corrected to yield a polyalanine model having approximately 60% completeness of the backbone. Following rigid body refinement using a 1.8 Å data set, this intermediate model along with the 1.8 Å data set was used as input into ARP/wARP, which was then able to build a model of 90% completeness with docked side-chains. The model was then completed manually and refined against the 1.8 Å data. This trigalUA complex was used a

direct starting point in refining the digalUA and 4,5unsatdigalUA complexes. Data collection, phasing and refinement of unliganded-TogB TogB at 15 mg/ml crystallized in 35% PEG 4000, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6). X-ray diffraction data of native TogB were collected at 113 K by freezing the crystal directly in the cryo-stream without any additional cryo-protection. The structure of unliganded TogB was solved by molecular replacement using molrep45 with the individual domains from the TogB-trigalUA complex as separate search models. The model was then completed manually by successive rounds of building and refinement. Protein Data Bank accession codes Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank for TogB, TogBdiGalUA, TogB-unsatdiGalUA, and TogB-triGalUA with the accession codes 2UVG, 2UVH, 2UVI, and 2UVJ, respectively.
