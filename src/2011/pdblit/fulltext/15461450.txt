ABSTRACT: Several mutant Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferases (eAATases) have been characterized in the attempt to evolve or rationally redesign the substrate specificity of eAATase into that of E. coli tyrosine aminotransferase (eTATase). These include HEX (designed), HEX + A293D (design followed by directed evolution), and SRHEPT (directed evolution). The A293D mutation realized from directed evolution of HEX is here imported into the SRHEPT platform by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in an enzyme (SRHEPT + A293D) with nearly the same ratio of kcat/KmPhe to kcat/KmAsp as that of wild-type eTATase. The A293D substitution is an important specificity determinant; it selectively disfavors interactions with dicarboxylic substrates and inhibitors compared to aromatic ones. Context dependence analysis is generalized to provide quantitative comparisons of a common substitution in two or more different protein scaffolds. High-resolution crystal structures of ligand complexes of HEX + A293D, SRHEPT, and SRHEPT + A293D were determined. We find that in both SRHEPT + A293D and HEX + A293D, the additional mutation holds the Arg 292 side chain away from the active site to allow increased specificity for phenylalanine over aspartate. The resulting movement of Arg 292 allows greater flexibility of the small domain in HEX + A293D. While HEX is always in the closed conformation, HEX + A293D is observed in both the closed and a novel open conformation, allowing for more rapid product release.

Escherichia coli aspartate aminotransferase (eAATase)1 and tyrosine aminotransferase (eTATase) are paralogs with sequences that are 72% similar and 43% identical. While eAATase readily catalyzes the reversible transamination of dicarboxylic substrates, it effectively discriminates against aromatic substrates (1, 2). In contrast, eTATase is an excellent catalyst for both (3). A major goal of protein engineering is to generate enzymes with targeted specificities. Many efforts that seek to convert the substrate specificity of one enzyme to that of another have been reported (4-8). Rational redesign and directed evolution have both been used to convert eAATase to an enzyme with specificity approaching that of eTATase. Homology modeling led to the construction of HEX, an eAATase variant with six mutations based on active site residues conserved in known aspartate aminotransferase

sequences but different in eTATase (9). The introduced rational substitutions successfully broaden catalytic activity; the specificity of HEX for phenylalanine is increased by more than 3 orders of magnitude, while near-wild-type activity with aspartate is retained. However, HEX does not complement aromatic amino acid auxotrophy in TATase-deficient E. coli, and exhibits strong product inhibition as evidenced by low values of Km and KD for dicarboxylic ligands (9, 10). A single round of directed evolution of HEX with selection for complementation of tyrosine auxotrophy yielded HEX + A293D,2 a mutant with reduced affinity for dicarboxylic ligands (10). A third eAATase variant, SRHEPT, was constructed by combining seven of the most frequently occurring mutations arising from directed evolution of the wild-type enzyme with genetic selection for aromatic aminotransferase activity (11). SRHEPT, while exhibiting aromatic and dicarboxylic kcat/Km values that are comparable with those of HEX, shares only two mutations with it. A fourth mutant presented here, SRHEPT + A293D, was constructed by introducing the A293D mutation into SRHEPT. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for SRHEPT + A293D with phenylalanine, aspartate, and alanine, along with the cosubstrate R-ketoglutarate (R-KG). The new variant has nearly the same specificity for phenylalanine versus aspartate as that exhibited by wild-type eTATase and, in this respect, is a significant improvement over its progenitor, SRHEPT. The effect of the A293D substitution is moderately dependent on the protein scaffold into which it is introduced (HEX or SRHEPT). This conclusion is supported and

FIGURE 1: Location of HEX and SRHEPT mutations. Stereoview of the wild-type eAATase active site with maleate bound. Residues are colored to indicate the introduced mutations. Gray residues (140, 194, 258, 292, and 386) were not mutated but contact the inhibitor, maleate (labeled "mal"). Cyan residues (39, 41, 47, and 69) are mutated in HEX and HEX + A293D, while yellow residues (12, 13, 34, 261, and 285) are mutated in SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D. Two of the green residues (109 and 297) are mutated in all four eAATase variants, and the third green residue (position 293) is mutated in both HEX + A293D and SRHEPT + A293D. Residues marked with an asterisk are contributed by the other subunit.

quantified by the steady-state kinetic data and inhibitor binding assays with maleate and hydrocinnamate (Hca), which are aspartate and phenylalanine analogues, respectively. High-resolution crystal structures were determined for several complexes of HEX + A293D, SRHEPT, and SRHEPT + A293D. Comparison with the available HEX and eAATase structures gives insight into the mechanisms of manifestation of the mutations. The mutations not only alter direct contacts between the protein and ligand but also promote flexibility of large regions of the enzyme. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Strains and Plasmids. Aminotransferase-deficient E. coli strain MG204 (his23, proB, trpA-605, lacI3, lacZ118, gyrA, rpsL, aspC::kanr, tyrB, ilVE, recA::Tn10) used for protein overexpression was a gift of I. Fotheringham (Nutrasweet Corp.). E. coli strain DH10B (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used for plasmid generation. Plasmid pJO2 contains wildtype eAATase downstream of its native promoter in pUC119 (9). Mutants. HEX + A293D and SRHEPT mutants in modified pJO2 are described elsewhere (10, 11). SRHEPT + A293D was derived from SRHEPT by polymerase chain reaction with the mutating primers 5-GCGGCGATTCGCGCTAACTACTCTTCCCCACC-3 and 5-GGTGGGGAAGAGTAGTTAGCGCGAATCGCCGC-3, and external primers and subcloning procedures described previously (10). The resulting mutagenic fragments replaced the wild-type sequence in pJO2. Purification of HEX + A293D, SRHEPT, and SRHEPT + A293D followed the protocol of Herold and Kirschner (12) with modifications by Onuffer and Kirsch (9). Yields were typically g100 mg/L, as determined by the absorbance at 280 nm. Figure 1 illustrates the mutations that were made. Steady-State Kinetics. The concentration of active SRHEPT + A293D was determined from the absorbance at 330 nm following addition of enzyme to 20 mM cysteinesulfinic acid in 200 mM TAPS at pH 8 and 140 mM KCl, where 330 ) 9140 AU M-1 cm-1 (13). Steady-state kinetics with R-ketoglutarate and aspartate, phenylalanine, or alanine were determined with an MDH, HO-HxoDH (14), or LDH coupled assay, respectively, under the conditions described in Table

a Assays were performed in 200 mM TAPS at pH 8, 140 mM KCl, 20 µM PLP, and 150 µM NADH, with 68 nM SRHEPT + A293D. The concentrations of HO-HxoDH, MDH, or LDH were sufficiently high to ensure that the observed rates were independent of the concentration of coupling enzyme. The concentration of Phe varied from 0.02 to 0.90 mM, that of Asp from 0.5 to 40.0 mM, that of Ala from 1 to 160 mM, and that of R-KG from 0.05 to 10 mM except in the LDH-coupled assay, where it was held constant at 8 mM. Standard errors are in parentheses. b No saturation observed.

Background rates were measured in the absence of aminotransferase. Data were fit to a straight line with Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) for the assay with alanine. For assays with aspartate and phenylalanine, kcat and Km values were calculated with SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) by a nonlinear regression fit of the data based on eq 1, which describes a ping-pong, bi-bi mechanism.

Crystallization. Crystals were grown at 19°C by the hanging-drop technique under the previously described conditions (15), with modifications. Drops (3 µL) containing 30 mg/mL purified enzyme in 20 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, 10 µM PLP, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM DTT were mixed with 3 µL of reservoir solution (2% PEG 400, 200 mM N-methylmorpholine at pH 7.5, and 1.95-2.35 M ammonium sulfate). Enzyme-inhibitor complexes were obtained by cocrystallization with either maleate or Hca (20 mM). Structural Analysis. All diffraction data were collected on beamline 8.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with HKL2000 (16). After subtraction of the ligands from the models, the structures were determined by molecular replacement with AMoRe (17). Ligand-free HEX [PDB entry 1AHE (15)] served as a starting model for ligandfree HEX + A293D, the HEX-Hca complex [PDB entry 1AHX (15)] for Hca-inhibited HEX + A293D, SRHEPT, and SRHEPT + A293D, and the wild-type eAATasemaleate complex [PDB entry 1ASM (18)] for maleateinhibited SRHEPT. Manual model building was carried out with O (19), followed by refinement using REFMAC5 (20), a second round of model building, and TLS refinement (20). Structural overlays for analysis were made using LSQKAB by aligning large domain residues (46-329). Images were produced with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, 2002). RESULTS Steady-State Kinetics. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the SRHEPT + A293D variant of eAATase are given in Table 1. No saturation was observed up to 160 mM alanine. The value of kcat/Km for phenylalanine is more than 2 orders of magnitude greater than that for alanine, and is 15-fold greater than that for aspartate. The Km for aspartate is nearly 2 orders of magnitude greater than that for phenylalanine, and 50 times greater than the intracellular concentration of aspartate in E. coli (21). The Km values for R-KG and phenylalanine are close to their physiological concentrations at 0.48-2.6 and 0.30 mM, respectively (21, 22). The kinetics exhibited by variant and wild-type aminotransferases with aspartate, phenylalanine, and alanine are collected in Table 2. The ratio of kcat/Km values for phenylalanine versus aspartate for SRHEPT + A293D is 15000-fold greater than that for wild-type eAATase, and is nearly equal to that of wild-type eTATase. However, the kcat/ KmPhe of SRHEPT + A293D, although 2-fold greater than that of SRHEPT, is 1 order of magnitude less than that of wild-type eTATase.

Dissociation Constants. Table 3 presents the KD values for the wild-type and variant aminotransferase-inhibitor complexes with maleate and Hca. Affinity for Hca is significantly enhanced for every variant, compared to those of the wild-type aminotransferases. The KD values for maleate are more variable; they remain high for the HEX + A293D and SRHEPT + A293D complexes, but are more than 40-fold lower in HEX and SRHEPT than in eTATase. The high affinity of HEX for dicarboxylic ligands is likely responsible for its inability to function in ViVo (10). Crystal Structures. Wild-type eAATase is active as a dimer. Each monomer has 396 residues with one pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), and consists of a large domain (residues 47-329), a small domain (residues 16-46 and 330-409), and a short dimerization arm (residues 5-15).2 The active site is comprised of residues from both chains (Figure 1). These characteristics also hold true for the following determined mutant eAATase structures: the unliganded and Hca complex of HEX + A293D, the Hca and maleate complexes of SRHEPT, and the Hca complex of SRHEPT + A293D. Data collection, refinement, and structural statistics are given in Table 4. The mutant complexes were refined to 2.0, 1.9, 1.9, 1.9, and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively, and all R-factors and stereochemical parameters are as expected for structures at this resolution. The SRHEPTmaleate and SRHEPT + A293D-Hca complexes were found to be in the P63 space group, which is novel for aspartate aminotransferase and its variants. The asymmetric unit contains either a dimer or a monomer for the P63 or C2221 structure presented here, respectively. HEX + A293D. The introduction of the A293D substitution into HEX does not greatly alter the mode of Hca binding. The R-carboxylate group of Hca forms hydrogen bonds with Arg 386, and its phenyl ring extends into a hydrophobic cluster comprised of Trp 140, Ile 37, Ile 17, and Leu 18 (15). As shown in Figure 2, Asp 293 forms a salt bridge with Arg 292 in both the unliganded and Hca-inhibited

The hydrogen bonds that are observed between Arg 292 and Asp 15 (not shown) in the unliganded HEX complex are disrupted by Asp 293.

sociates with Hca and maleate in the same manner as in HEX complexes (15). Comparison of the maleate and Hca complexes of SRHEPT provides additional support for the substrate-recognition function of Arg 292; while the guanidine side chain points away from the active site in the Hca complex, it makes a salt bridge with the carboxylate group of bound maleate. Upon introduction of the A293D substitution into SRHEPT, N of Arg 292 swings 2.5 Å away from the active site toward the Asp 293 side chain, and forms a new hydrogen bond with the Asp 293 carboxylate. DISCUSSION Substrate Specificity of SRHEPT + A293D. Adaptation of an enzyme for targeting a new substrate in directed evolution is generally achieved by specificity relaxation (23, 24). The introduction of the A293D substitution does not enhance the selectivity of aspartate over alanine in SRHEPT (Table 2), but increases the ratio of kcat/KmPhe to kcat/KmAsp in both HEX and SRHEPT through a reduction in kcat/KmAsp. Introduction of the A293D Substitution in Two Contexts. The effects of the added A293D mutation can be appreciated by comparing the properties of SRHEPT + A293D to those of SRHEPT, and those of HEX + A293D to those of HEX. The affinity for aromatic substrates over dicarboxylic ones is enhanced in both cases, but to different degrees. The A293D mutation increases KDmaleate by 380-fold in HEX and g10-fold in SRHEPT (Table 3). There is little effect on KDHca upon introduction of the A293D substitution in either case. Thus, the introduction of the A293D substitution enhances selectivity for Hca over maleate. Kinetic data presented in Table 2 extend these results. SRHEPT + A293D has a 2-fold greater kcat/KmPhe than SRHEPT, and an almost 11-fold lesser kcat/KmAsp. Thus, introduction of the A293D mutation enhances specificity for phenylalanine over aspartate by more than 21-fold. Adding A293D to HEX more than doubles kcat/KmPhe, an effect similar to that realized by the corresponding addition to SRHEPT. However, kcat/KmAsp decreases only 2-fold. The effect of the A293D mutation is to increase the specificity for phenyl-

alanine over aspartate by only 6-fold in the context of HEX. This is 4 times lower than the corresponding change in SRHEPT. It follows that the effect of this single substitution not only can be added to the effects of other mutations in the enzyme but also is context-dependent. ComparatiVe QuantitatiVe Analysis of the Introduction of the A293D Substitution of HEX and SRHEPT. The terms I (impact) and C (context dependence) were introduced to quantitate substitutions in the analysis of chimeras (1, 25). They are defined in eqs 3 and 4:

Ichimera ) GSAfB - GSBfA Cchimera ) GSAfB + GSBfA

(3) (4)

where the SAfB and SBfA subscripts refer to the change in free energy effects observed on an addressable parameter in the forward chimeras and retrochimeras, respectively. Both I and C are necessary to distinguish the trivial case in which I = C = 0 (1, 25). I and C values can be extended to provide a quantitative understanding of the effects of introduction of a common replacement into two or more different protein scaffolds. They are applied here to the A293D replacement in HEX and SRHEPT. Equations 3 and 4 need to be modified for this purpose because the replacement is the same, while in chimeras, the second replacement reverses the first.

Ireplacement ) GSAfA+X + GSBfB+X Creplacement ) GSAfA+X - GSBfB+X

(5) (6)

In our application of eqs 5 and 6, X is the common replacement, A293D, and A and B are the scaffolds, HEX and SRHEPT. Substitutions that are independent of the accepting platform have a Creplacement of 0, while the corresponding I value measures the magnitude of the effect on the addressed parameter.

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 40, 2004 12785 form allows diffusion of molecules into and out of the active site. However, crystal structures of HEX show that this variant does not change conformation, but remains closed regardless of whether ligand is bound (15). Four of the engineered substitutions in HEX (V39L, K41Y, T47I, and N69L) extend a hydrophobic patch that includes the side chains of Tyr 263, Trp 140, Tyr 70, Ile 73, Ile 37, Leu 18, and Ile 17 (27). The nonpolar cluster stabilizes the closed conformation (15). It was argued that the failure of HEX to function as an aromatic aminotransferase in ViVo is due to product inhibition from tightly bound dicarboxylic acids, which results from the inflexibility of the small domain (10). These data provide structural verification for that conjecture. Introduction of A293D results in a novel intermediate conformation between the half-open and closed states that may decrease the energetic barrier for product release compared to that extant for the HEX complexes. Whereas small domain residues shift more than 3.5 Å between the half-open and closed conformations of wild-type eAATase upon substrate association (18), they do not move significantly in HEX, which is stabilized in the closed conformation. Introduction of the A293D substitution partially restores domain flexibility such that corresponding residues in HEX + A293D move up to 3 Å upon substrate binding (Figure 3). Furthermore, the direction of movement of small domain residues between the closed and open forms is different than what has been observed in eAATase. The small domain of HEX + A293D opens along a vector that is approximately 40° different from that of wild-type eAATase. The A293D mutation promotes domain opening by altering interactions between key residues in the enzyme. Specifically, Arg 292 forms hydrogen bonds with Asp 15 and Ser 296 in unliganded structures of eAATase and HEX, but these bonds are broken in HEX + A293D. Similarly, Arg 292 forms a hydrogen bond with Asn 142 in Hca-bound HEX; however, the bond is broken in HEX + A293D, and Arg 292 makes a new hydrogen bond with Asp 15. In both cases, Arg 292 makes new hydrogen bonds with Asp 293 (Figure 2). Structural Effects of SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D Replacements. Residues in the N-terminal region interact with the large domain of the other subunit. The loss in activity for aromatic substrates upon substitution of the flexible eTATase N-terminal arm with corresponding eAATase residues suggested that they constitute an important specificity determinant (28). High-resolution crystal structures of Paracoccus denitrificans TATase supported this conclusion by implicating flexibility of residues 15 and 16 in ligand recognition (29). Substitution of a proline at position 13 with threonine in SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D increases the freedom of motion in this region, leading to enhanced aromatic substrate recognition with respect to wild-type eAATase. Mobility is likely further improved when a hydrogen bond between the main chain nitrogen of residue 12 and Ser 285 O is broken due to the evolved S285G mutation. These two substitutions permit greater movement of the N-terminal residues upon introduction of the A293D mutation into SRHEPT than when the mutation is introduced into HEX (Figure 5). It is unclear what role, if any, the A12T mutation plays in SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D. Although all replacements in SRHEPT were chosen on the basis of the frequency with which they appeared in evolved variants, only the P13T mutation was

FIGURE 4: Impact and context dependence of the A293D substitution in two scaffolds. The free energy or transition-state free energy for each of four related eAATase variants (HEX, HEX + A293D, SRHEPT, and SRHEPT + A293D) was calculated for the kinetic and binding parameters of aromatic and dicarboxylic ligands. Plots are shown for the G or Gq for HEX + A293D compared to its parent scaffold HEX (white bars) and SRHEPT + A293D compared to its parent SRHEPT (hatched bars). The impact of A293D on ligand binding and substrate specificity is the sum of the G values of SRHEPT and HEX, while the context dependence of this replacement is calculated by subtracting the G of SRHEPT from that of HEX. The A293D substitution has a small impact on specificity for aromatic ligands, and a large impact on specificity of dicarboxylic ligands. Likewise, the context dependence of this replacement is negligible for aromatic compounds and moderate for dicarboxylic ligands.

Figure 4 illustrates that A293D has a large impact and moderate context dependence with respect to dicarboxylic ligands, and that both the impact and context dependence are insignificant with respect to aromatic ligands. Therefore, A293D selectively modulates interaction with dicarboxylic ligands. The similar magnitudes and opposite signs of I and C for kcat/KmAsp signify that the A293D substitution plays a larger role in aspartate specificity for one scaffold compared to the other. The negative value of C for kcat/KmAsp reveals that the effect is larger in SRHEPT. Structural Effects of the A293D Replacement. The mechanism through which the A293D mutation affects HEX substrate specificity manifests in two ways: (1) through repositioning of the Arg 292 side chain and (2) through small domain movement. Interaction of wild-type eAATase with dicarboxylic substrates is largely achieved through salt bridge contacts with the guanidine side chains of Arg 292 and Arg 386, which are pointed into the active site; this is termed the "up" conformation of the Arg 292 arm. Arg 292 in HEX also exists in the up conformation (Figure 2a), as well as in a "down" conformation that has never been observed in wildtype eAATase. In the latter form, depicted in Figure 2b, Arg 292 swings away from the active site to accommodate larger aromatic substrates. Introduction of the A293D mutation into HEX relieves dicarboxylic acid hyperaffinity because Arg 292 is maintained in the down conformation through interaction with Asp 293 (Figure 2a,b). This new orientation disfavors association with dicarboxylate ligands. The eAATase reaction is catalyzed through an induced fit mechanism, where the small domain pivots away from the large domain prior to product release (18, 26). Since the active site is at the interface of the large and small domains, the change in conformation from the "closed" to "half-open"

FIGURE 5: Flexibility of the N-terminus. The Hca complexes of HEX (gray) and HEX + A293D (blue) are shown in panel a and those of SRHEPT (gray) and SRHEPT + A293D (blue) in panel b. A dashed line indicates selected hydrogen bonds, and an asterisk denotes that the residue is contributed by the other subunit. The active site and the inhibitor are out of view to the top right. The movement in the N-terminus of the SRHEPT structure due to the added A293D mutation is greater than that of HEX. For example, the CR atom of residue 14 moves 2.2 Å upon addition of the A293D substitution in SRHEPT (direction indicated by an arrow), but only 1.8 Å in the HEX scaffold. There are three amino acid substitutions in this region in SRHEPT (A12T, P13T, and S285G) that are absent in HEX.

found in all 12 of the sequenced clones, whereas S285G and A12T were each found in only three (11). Thus, the P13T substitution is likely the most important factor in conferring aromatic aminotransferase ability in SRHEPT, and contributes most to the flexibility of the N-terminal arm. The S285G and A12T mutations likely augment the effect, but are less critical. The G261A replacement is located at the far end of the hydrophobic patch next to Tyr 263. It extends this patch and likely contributes the same function as the V39L, K41Y, T47I, and N69L mutations did in HEX, producing a more hydrophobic active site to promote binding of aromatic ligands and stabilizing the closed conformation to facilitate tight binding of both aromatic and dicarboxylic ligands. The N34D mutation in SRHEPT is located near the opposite end of the active site. In the unliganded eAATase structure, the side chain of Asn 34 is 3.0 Å from the backbone nitrogen of Gly 36. One subunit maintains this hydrogen bond in the maleate complex, but the other does not. That hydrogen bond is present in both subunits of inhibited SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D. The result is that the carbonyl oxygen of Gly 36 is held 3.0-3.2 Å from N of Arg 386 in SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D, but this hydrogen bond occurs in only one subunit of the maleateinhibited wild-type eAATase structure. In all wild-type and variant eAATases, Arg 386 forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate of dicarboxylic and aromatic ligands. The N34D mutation may serve to enhance ligand recognition by Arg 386 through a strengthened hydrogen bond with Gly 36. The T109S and N297S substitutions in HEX were evaluated previously (15, 25), and their roles in SRHEPT and SRHEPT + A293D are expected to be similar. The T109S mutation extends a contact surface for the substrate phenyl ring by rearranging a hydrogen bond network, while the N297S replacement serves to pull a water molecule away from the active site that would otherwise interfere with aromatic ligand association. Both modifications specifically tailor the active site to accommodate aromatic ligands. Concluding Remarks. Why do naturally occurring TATases and the directly evolved enzymes survive in ViVo while

HEX does not? Two factors contribute to tight binding of dicarboxylic products and substrates: the up conformation of the Arg 292 arm and the closed domain configuration in the unliganded form. Tight ligand binding results from favoring both of these conformations, and relaxation of either factor reduces affinity. HEX has both factors, but it is likely that SRHEPT adopts a more open conformation as it contains only a single mutation at the domain interface. The introduction of the A293D mutation further reduces dicarboxylic acid specificity selectively by removing the important salt bridge between Arg 292 and the ligand, and relaxes the closed conformation, thus relieving the product inhibition exhibited by HEX.
