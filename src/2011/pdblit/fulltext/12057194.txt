Although no direct DNA binding properties have been attributed to the Ski/SnoN proteins, they are known to associate with DNA in complex with other nuclear proteins (Nagase et al., 1990) including the Smads (Luo et al., 1999) and nuclear factor 1 (Tarapore et al., 1997). The Ski-Smad interaction provides a direct link between Ski and the TGF- pathway; Ski/SnoN bind to Smad4 and the R-Smads and repress TGF- , activin, and BMP signaling (Akiyoshi et al., 1999; Luo et al., 1999; Stroschein et al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2000). Several mechanisms have been proposed for Ski-mediated TGF- repression. Ski/SnoN can repress transcription by recruiting a corepressor complex containing N-CoR/SMRT, Sin3A, and HDAC (Nagase et al., 1990). Ski can also interfere with the interaction between Smad3 and the transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP (Akiyoshi et al., 1999). Structural evidence suggests that Ski competes with the R-Smads for Smad4 binding, thus preventing the assembly of the active heteromeric Smad complex and the subsequent activation of TGF- -responsive genes (Wu et al., 2002). It has also been proposed that Ski can suppress the TGF- pathway by preventing the liganddependent phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Prunier et al., 2003). In addition to its effect on the TGFpathway, Ski represses Rb-mediated transcriptional repression (Tokitou et al., 1999) and retinoic acid receptor signaling (Dicker et al., 1999). Interaction between Ski and the transforming protein of acute promyelocytic leukemias (PML-RARalpha; a fusion of the PML protein with the retinoic acid receptor ) has been implicated in leukemogenesis (Khan et al., 2001). Ski also binds to the highly conserved SNW region of Skip (Ski-interacting protein), and the two proteins synergistically activate transcription (Dahl et al., 1998b; Prathapam et al., 2001). The human SKI protein (shown schematically in Figure 1A) consists of 728 residues, while its viral homolog, v-Ski, corresponds to residues 24­441 of SKI. This N-terminal region common to SKI and v-Ski is also the most conserved region between SKI and the related gene product SnoN. Furthermore, residues 20­304 of v-Ski (43­326 of SKI) form a functional, protease-resistant domain that retains the biological activities of v-Ski including the induction of morphological transformation, anchorage independent growth, and myogenic differentiation (Zheng et al., 1997b). The C-terminal 191 amino acids of SKI, which are not present in v-Ski, mediate oligomerization (Heyman and Stavnezer, 1994; Zheng et al., 1999). Within the N-terminal transformation domain are several recognizable motifs including a proline-rich region, two predicted amphipathic helices, and conserved Cys and His residues characteristic of zinc finger-like structures. Mutational analyses suggest that while most deletions within the N-terminal domain lead to transformation-deficient Ski proteins, small deletions in the first 78 residues have little effect and the region between residues 128 and 245 is the most sensitive to mutagenesis (Zheng et al., 1997b). The N-terminal

Summary The nuclear protooncoprotein SKI negatively regulates transforming growth factor- (TGF- ) signaling in cell growth and differentiation. It directly interacts with the Smads and, by various mechanisms, represses the transcription of TGF- -responsive genes. SKI is a multidomain protein that includes a domain bearing high sequence similarity with the retinal determination protein Dachshund (the Dachshund homology domain, DHD). The SKI-DHD has been implicated in SMAD-2/3, N-CoR, SKIP, and PML-RARalpha bind° ing. The 1.65 A crystal structure of the Dachshund homology domain of human SKI is reported here. The SKI-DHD adopts a mixed / structure which includes features found in the forkhead/winged-helix family of DNA binding proteins, although SKI-DHD is not a DNA binding domain. Residues that form a contiguous surface patch on SKI-DHD are conserved within the Ski/ Sno family and with Dachshund, suggesting that this domain may mediate intermolecular interactions common to these proteins. Introduction ski is a protooncogene whose expression is upregulated in human tumor cell lines derived from neuroblastomas, melanomas, and carcinomas of the stomach, thyroid, vulva, lung, and prostate (Fumagalli et al., 1993; Medrano, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). ski also induces differentiation, as evidenced by skeletal muscle hypertrophy in mice and muscle differentiation of quail embryo cells when ski is overexpressed. Mice lacking ski have defects in skeletal muscle development, neurulation, and craniofacial development (Berk et al., 1997). Overexpression of Xenopus ski leads to cell-autonomous induction of a secondary neural axis, suggesting a role for Ski in neural axis formation in vivo (Amaravadi et al., 1997). At the molecular level, the Ski/SnoN family of proteins (which includes Ski, its viral homolog v-Ski, and the Skirelated novel protein SnoN) are transcriptional regulators that variably act as activators or repressors de*Correspondence: rashmi.hegde@cchmc.org

domain was predicted to form a single structural unit (Zheng et al., 1997b); however, separate regions within it have been implicated in binding to Smad4 (residues 219­312 [Wu et al., 2002]) and the R-Smads (bipartite binding by residues 17­45 and 125­131). Thus, Ski could simultaneously contact both Smad4 and the R-Smads. Furthermore, the region of highest sequence conservation among the Ski/Sno family members is involved in binding N-CoR and Skip. Available data thus suggests that the N-terminal transformation domain of Ski appears to be involved in numerous protein-protein interactions using distinct surfaces. In addition to the functional domains described above, the Ski/SnoN proteins also have domains that share sequence and structural features with the retinal determination protein Dachshund. Dachshund is involved in many instances of cell-fate determination, notably in the development of eyes, muscle, and leg (Caubit et al., 1999; Davis et al., 1999, 2001; Hammond et al., 1998; Heanue et al., 1999). Residues 185­282 of human Dachshund (DACHbox-N) share 28% identity with residues 97­191 of all vertebrate Ski and Sno proteins (Figure 1B). Much weaker homology is also present between the C-terminal DACHbox-C domain of Dachshund and the C-terminal oligomerization domain of Ski and SnoN. This latter homology is restricted to the alignment of charged and hydrophobic residues that are expected

to participate in the formation of a leucine zipper-like motif and mediate oligomerization (Zheng et al., 1997a). Based on this homology, Dachshund, Ski, and Sno have been classified as a superfamily whose members are likely to share structural and functional properties. DACHbox-N has structural features characteristic of the winged-helix/forkhead class of DNA binding proteins (Kim et al., 2002). Here we report the crystal structure of the Dachshund homology domain of human SKI (SKI-DHD; residues 91­ 192). As expected, the overall fold of SKI-DHD is similar to that of DACHbox-N. However, SKI-DHD does not have the electropositive surface present on the putative DNA binding face of DACHbox-N suggesting that SKI is not likely to contact DNA via its DHD. We also map previous mutational and functional analyses on the three-dimensional structure of SKI-DHD to provide insights into structure-function relationships. Results and Discussion Structure of SKI-DHD The structure of SKI-DHD was determined using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion from crystals containing Se-Met. There are three methionine residues in SKI-DHD (including one methionine present as a cloning artifact) which resulted in a strong anomalous signal

the Ramachandran plot while the remaining 6.7% are within the "additionally allowed" region. Residues 98­192 of SKI-DHD form a compact, globular domain comprised of a twisted five-stranded antiparallel sheet in the center flanked by three helices on one surface and a single helix on the other (Figures 2B and 2C). Residues 91­97 extend beyond this domain, and the Gly-Ser-His-Met residues N-terminal to residue 91 (which are cloning artifacts) make contact with a symmetry-related molecule. The three-helix subdomain includes a helix-turn-helix motif (residues L123­E145) which immediately follows the first three strands in the sequence. The third helix forming this subdomain is at the extreme C terminus of the SKI-DHD primary structure. Following the helix-turn-helix is a - - motif which contributes two strands ( 4 and 5) to the sheet, as well as positioning a single helix on the face of the sheet opposite to that occupied by the three-helix subdomain. Using the DALI server the closest structural relative of the SKI-DHD structure was DACHbox-N (Z score 14.4) (Holm and Sander, 1997; Kim et al., 2002). The only other notable match was to the transcription factor mbp1 (Z score 3.5), which contains a winged-helix DNA binding motif (Taylor et al., 1997; Xu et al., 1997). This motif consists of - - - -W- , where the two helices form a classical helix-turn-helix motif and the hairpin between the last two strands forms the wing (W) which also participates in DNA binding. Residues 118­178 of SKI-DHD

correspond to this motif, but as in the case of DACHbox-N, SKI-DHD has an additional helix (residues 155­163, C) inserted between strands 4 and 5. Structural Homology with Dachshund The overall fold of SKI-DHD (residues 96­192) is similar to that of the N-terminal conserved domain of Dachshund, DACHbox-N (residues 184­282) (Figure 3A), as was predicted based on their sequence homology (Kim et al., 2002). The two structures differ by a root-mean° square deviation of 2.13 A between 97 C atoms. In keeping with their conserved folds, the greatest similarity in sequence between SKI-DHD and DACHbox-N is among buried hydrophobic residues. There is a 2 residue deletion in the SKI-DHD sequence relative to DACH box-N (corresponding to DACHbox-N residues 222­ 223), which results in helix B being poorly superimposable in the two structures. While the folds are similar, the surface properties of SKI-DHD are considerably different from those of DACH box-N (Figure 3B). DACHbox-N has a large area of positive charge on the surface corresponding to the second helix of the helix-turn-helix motif and the wing. This feature of DACHbox-N, along with its structural homology with the DNA binding protein mbp1 suggested that it may also be a DNA binding protein. This prediction is borne out by the demonstration that Dachshund can bind to chromatin DNA through its DACHbox-N domain (Ikeda et al., 2002). In stark contrast, the corresponding

The ribbon diagram shows the orientation, and the helix-turn-helix and "wing" segments are shown in cyan for reference. (D) Stereoview of SKI-DHD with ball-and-stick representations of residues that were the subject of mutational analyses described in the text. These include Pro124, Gln125, Ile126, Leu127, Val130, Leu131, and Asp181. Except for Asp181, replacement of these largely buried hydrophobic residues will most likely result in structural destabilization by disrupting the hydrophobic core of the protein.

surface of SKI-DHD is relatively neutral or electronegative, making it very unlikely that SKI-DHD directly contacts DNA. On the other hand, the biochemical evidence suggests a protein binding role for the SKI-DHD. N-CoR interaction has been mapped to residues 99­274 of SKI, and SKIP interaction is mapped to residues 95­202 of SKI, both of which are in the SKI-DHD. N-CoR interaction has also been reported for the DACHbox-N domain of Dachshund (Wu et al., 2003), making it likely that stereochemical features common to SKI-DHD and DACHbox-N are involved in these interactions. However, mapping the sequence homology between DACHbox-N and SKIDHD on their three-dimensional structures reveals that surface residues, which are most likely to participate in protein-protein interactions, are poorly conserved except around the surface described by helix D (Figure 3C).

Mapping Mutations on the SKI-DHD Structure The effect of mutagenizing Ski has been examined both in terms of specific molecular interactions (with the Smads and N-CoR) and complex biological outcomes (transformation ability, myogenic activity). Since there is as yet no clear correlation between the known proteinprotein interactions and the processes of transformation/differentiation, these will be considered separately in the analysis below. There is some disagreement in the literature about the domains of Ski that interact with the R-Smads. Residues 17­45 were shown by Qin and coworkers to be sufficient for interaction with the phosphorylated, trimeric form of Smad-2/3 (Qin et al., 2002). However, mutational analysis by Ueki and coworkers (Ueki and Hayman, 2003a) suggests that the DHD of Ski may also be involved in Smad3 interaction. Specifically, the region between Q125 and L131 was identified as forming a Smad3-inter-

Structure 790

acting surface based on point mutants. Residues 121­ 127 of SKI-DHD form the first helix ( A) of the helixturn-helix motif and residues 128­135 constitute the turn. Side chains of residues Ile126, Leu127, Val130, and Leu131 form part of the hydrophobic core of the protein and are not surface accessible (Figure 3D). Replacing these side chains with smaller ones would lead to destabilizing cavities in the protein. The poorly accessible side chain of Gln125 forms a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the backbone amide of Ser111 which would be absent in the Q125A mutant. Structural disruption might also be expected for the P124A mutant. This residue is at the N terminus of helix A (position 2 of the helix) and its backbone carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen bonded to both the backbone nitrogen and the Asn side chain of residue 128 (position N 4). Prolines at the N termini of helices impose strict geometries contributing to the specificity of the fold rather than to helix stability (Viguera and Serrano, 1999), suggesting that the replacement of Pro124 with an Ala could lead to structural perturbation. On the whole, available mutations in the 121­131 region of SKI would destabilize the overall fold of the domain, and with the exception of Gln125 and Pro124, the residues targeted for mutation have little or no surface accessibility. Hence the structure of SKI-DHD and the available mutational analyses do not provide conclusive evidence for a direct Smad2/3-interaction role for this region of the protein. On the other hand, these mutations suggest that an intact DHD contributes to Smad3 binding, perhaps by correctly orienting Smad3-contacting amino acids (residues 17­45). These observations are consistent with a previous report by Qin et al. that residues 16­40 of SKI are sufficient for interaction with a Smad3 trimer (Qin et al., 2002). In their model, they propose that residues 16­24 form an amphipathic helix with hydrophobic side chains making contact with the Smad3 surface. It is possible that the DHD provides the scaffold for presenting these residues of SKI for Smad3 interaction without itself directly making contact. Further evidence that the SKI-DHD might form an independent domain comes from the observation that a point mutant in the c-Ski-DHD (equivalent to L127P of human SKI) severely impaired its interaction with N-CoR and Smad-2/3, while not affecting c-Ski-Sin3 interaction (Nomura et al., 1999; Ueki and Hayman, 2003b). Moreover, this mutation impaired the inhibitory activity of Ski in VDR (vitamin D receptor) signaling. Leu127 is in the last turn of helix A and its amino group hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of residue Ala124 in classical -helical fashion. In general, introduction of Pro residues into helices destabilizes proteins (Gray et al., 1996; Sauer et al., 1992) particularly when a backbone hydrogen bond is disrupted, as in this case. As might be expected, an L127A mutation which retains the ability to form backbone hydrogen bonds, had no effect on Smad2/3 binding. Hence it is likely that the effect of the L127P (L110P in c-Ski) mutation on protein-protein interactions may be mediated by general destabilization of the SKI-DHD fold, rather than by disrupting a specific contact between molecules. Colmenares et al. created a transformation-defective v-Ski mutant by replacing an aspartate in helix D with

Ala-Arg-Pro-Gly. This in-frame insertion mutant was subsequently used by others to assign N-CoR/SMRT binding to the region 99­274 in SKI (Colmenares et al., 1991; Nomura et al., 1999). This mutation maps to Asp181 in SKI-DHD, and in the structure the side chain of Asp181 is hydrogen bonded to two water molecules. The ARPG insertion would not only shift the helix position and disrupt packing interactions but also introduces a bulky Arg side chain into the core followed by a helixdestabilizing Pro. Thus, the net effect of the ARPG insertion would again be gross destabilization of the structure. A deletion of residues 137­150 of v-Ski, which corresponds to residues 154­167 of SKI in C, was found to attenuate but not completely inactivate v-Ski's transformation and myogenic functions (Zheng et al., 1997b). Another target of mutagenesis was a potential zinc finger motif in the Cys/His-rich region between residues 143 and 153 of SKI. Replacement of the His and Cys residues in this region of v-Ski (residues 126­136 of v-Ski) had no effect on function (Zheng et al., 1997b). These residues are on B and 4, and although the Cys153 side chain is in the vicinity of the Cys122 and Cys174 side chains, there is no metal ion present and they do not participate in disulfide bonds. Thus, the structure corroborates the observation that Cys/His side chains in this region of SKI-DHD do not appear to be important for either structure or function.

Conclusions The crystallographic analysis reported here reveals that the Ski/Sno proteins share a domain of structural similarity with the retinal determination protein Dachshund. However, the striking differences in surface properties suggest that the SKI-DHD does not share the DNA binding surface described for Dachshund. Evidence suggests that the SKI-DHD, which bears structural similarity with the winged-helix/forkhead class of DNA binding proteins, uses this domain for protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, the Smad4 binding domain of Ski which is adjacent to the DHD also adopts a DNA binding fold (the SAND domain), yet it is not involved in DNA interaction (Wu et al., 2002). Hence the DHD is the second instance where a recognizable DNA binding fold is present in a protein-interaction domain of Ski. The homologous domains of Ski and Dachshund share protein partners such as N-CoR, and it is likely that stereochemical features common to the two proteins may play a role in these interactions. Toward this end, we have mapped regions of high conservation on the structure providing a framework for rational mutagenesis. Mutational analyses clearly underscore the functional importance of the Ski-DHD. However, since most available mutations are in poorly accessible residues and are predicted to cause large, nonspecific structural disruptions, it is not currently possible to map out the interaction surfaces with different protein partners. The availability of the three-dimensional structure makes possible a targeted analysis, by site-directed mutagenesis, of the numerous known Ski interactions.

Crystal Structure of SKI 791

Experimental Procedures Protein Overexpression and Purification Nucleotides encoding residues 91­192 of human SKI were inserted into the overexpression vector pET15b. The resulting plasmid (pET15b-SKI[91-192]) was transformed into the E.coli strain BL21(DE3). Large-scale cultures were grown at 37 C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 g ml 1), induced at mid-log with 0.1 mM isopropyl- -thiogalactopyranoside, and then maintained at 30 C for another 12 hr. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in equilibration buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged. Over 90% of His6-SKI-DHD was found in the supernatant. The cell lysate was applied to a Novagen His·Bind column preequilibrated with equilibration buffer at 4 C. SKI-DHD (with the additional residues GlySer-His-Met at the N terminus) was released in the supernatant through cleavage at a thrombin site present in the fusion protein between the His tag and SKI-DHD. The cleaved protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-75). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining of overloaded gels. Preparation of Se-Met Containing SKI-DHD The SKI-DHD sequence contains two methionines at positions 92 and 164. An additional methionine arises from the N-terminal residues that result from the use of the pET15b cloning vector. These Met residues were replaced with Se-Met by producing the protein in the methionine-requiring auxotrophic strain B834(DE3). The overexpression and purification procedures were similar to that for the native protein except that the bacterial cultures were grown in minimal media supplemented with Se-Met. Crystallization of SKI-DHD Crystals of Se-Met SKI-DHD were obtained from well solutions of 18%­22% PEG 3350, at pH 5.5­6 (100 mM Bis-Tris or MES was used as the buffer). Hanging drops containing equal volumes of 7.8­20 mg ml 1 protein and the well solution were used. Crystals ° appeared in 2­6 days. These crystals diffracted to 1.5 A and were used in crystal structure determination. The crystals were mono° ° clinic (P21) with unit cell dimensions: a 25.93 A, b 46.63 A, c ° 35.73 A, 93.97 with one molecule of SKI-DHD in the asymmetric unit. X-Ray Data Collection, Structure Solution, and Refinement Data on crystals of Se-Met SKI-DHD were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, beam-line 19-ID. The crystals were frozen in liquid ° nitrogen. Data were collected at three wavelengths (0.97834 A ° ° [peak], 0.97852 A [inflection], and 0.95372 A [remote]) at 170 C on a single crystal. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL package (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997); heavy atom sites were identified and refined using the SOLVE/RESOLVE package (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1999). Subsequent model building and structure analysis was conducted using O (Jones et al., 1991). Refinement was conducted with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) using all data and a bulk solvent correction. Multiple cycles of refinement, rebuilding, and addition of water molecules resulted in a final R factor of 18.4% ° (Rfree 20.6%) at 1.65 A using the peak wavelength. The final model contains residues 91­192 complete with side chains. The Gly-SerHis-Met at the N terminus that results from the cloning procedure is clearly visible and participates in crystal packing. A total of 110 water molecules have been included in the refinement. The stereochemical quality of the model fell well within the quality criteria of PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993).
