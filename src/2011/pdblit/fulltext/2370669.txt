Background: F1-ATPase, an oligomeric assembly with subunit stoichiometry 3 3 , is the catalytic component of the ATP synthase complex, which plays a central role in energy transduction in bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria. The crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F1-ATPase displays a marked asymmetry in the conformation and nucleotide content of the catalytic subunits. The 3 3 subcomplex of F1-ATPase has been assembled from subunits of the moderately thermophilic Bacillus PS3 made in Escherichia coli, and the subcomplex is active but does not show the catalytic cooperativity of intact F1-ATPase. The structure of this subcomplex should provide new information on the conformational variability of F1-ATPase and may provide insights into the unusual catalytic mechanism employed by this enzyme. Results: The crystal structure of the nucleotide-free bacterial 3 3 subcomplex of F1-ATPase, determined at 3.2 Å resolution, shows that the oligomer has exact threefold symmetry. The bacterial subunits adopt a conformation essentially identical to that of the nucleotide-free subunit in mitochondrial F1-ATPase; the subunits have similar conformations in both structures. Conclusions: The structures of the bacterial F1-ATPase and subunits are very similar to their counterparts in the mitochondrial enzyme, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism. The study presented here allows an analysis of the different conformations adopted by the and subunits and may ultimately further our understanding of this mechanism.

Introduction
ATP synthase plays a central role in energy conversion in mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria, generating ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate using energy derived from a transmembrane electrochemical potential gradient (for reviews see [1­3]). ATP synthase comprises a soluble catalytic component, F1, and a membrane-embedded segment, Fo, which transports protons. Because the separate F1 domain catalyses the hydrolysis of ATP, it is known as F1-ATPase. F1-ATPase is a well-conserved molecular assembly, in contrast to Fo where the subunit composition depends on the source. The F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1) has a molecular mass of 385 000 and a subunit composition 3 3  (molecular weights , 55 000; , 52 000; , 32 000; , 20 000; , 14 000) [4]. The amino acid sequences of the and subunits from TF1 and bovine mitochondrial F1 (MF1) are highly homologous (Fig. 1), with 59% sequence identity between subunits and 68% between subunits [5]. The 3 3 subcomplex of F1 has only been characterised from the thermophilic bacterium PS3 [6,7], which may be a

consequence of the enhanced stability of TF1 [4]. The 3 3 subcomplex has 20­25% of the ATPase activity of intact TF1 and has a similar substrate specificity for nucleotide triphosphates and a similar temperature dependence of its ATPase activity. The subcomplex, however, lacks the catalytic cooperativity of intact F1 [8], and its ATPase activity is not inhibited by azide and shows a broader specificity for divalent cations [6]. The PS3 3 3 subcomplex is cold-labile and in the absence of nucleotides it is only stable at a high concentration of sulphate, typically 200 mM [6]. The structures of F1, its 3 3 subcomplex and its subunits, have been studied by electron microscopy [9,10], small angle X-ray scattering [11], and X-ray crystallography [12­15]; the most detailed structural information has been obtained from the crystallographic analysis of bovine mitochondrial F1 (MF1) at 2.8 Å resolution [13]. In this structure the 3 3 sector is an approximately spherical assembly about 100 Å in diameter. Part of the subunit forms an -helical coiled-coil structure running along the axis of the 3 3 subcomplex [13] (Fig. 2). The

Aligned amino acid sequences and secondary structure elements of and subunits in the Bacillus PS3 3 3 subcomplex. The folds of the and subunits are similar, and so labels are only given for the subunit, except for the three C-terminal helices in the subunit. The alignment is based on a structure comparison between the and subunits using the program O [32]. Residues conserved in bovine MF1 are shown in blue for the subunit, and in green for the subunit. Nearly all of the residues known to be important in regulation and catalysis are strictly conserved. A dot indicates every tenth residue. The C-terminal ends of the barrel and the nucleotide-binding domains are shown by a single red asterisk and double red asterisks, respectively; the C terminus is indicated by a black asterisk.

three catalytic sites are located in the subunits, at the interface with a neighbouring subunit. There are also non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites in the subunits, at the interface with adjacent subunits. The structure of MF1 is asymmetrical, particularly in the nucleotide occupancy and conformations of the catalytic subunits, and in the interactions of the and subunits with the subunit. In the crystal structure, one subunit (M TP) binds the ATP analogue 5-adenylyl- , -imidodiphosphate (AMPPNP), the second (M DP) binds ADP and the third (M E) has no nucleotide bound. The subunits all bind AMPPNP, and are labelled according to the catalytic site to which they contribute, for example M TP forms the catalytic site with M TP. The M TP and M DP subunits have very similar conformations, which are distinct from that of the M E subunit. The three catalytic interfaces are quite different in character, and can be described as `open' (M E), `loose' (M TP) and `tight'

(M DP) depending on the extent of the interactions between the and subunits. The `binding change' mechanism of ATP synthesis [1] proposes that the three catalytic sites always adopt different conformations, but they each cycle sequentially between the three different states (open, loose and tight). This mechanism is supported by the crystal structure [13], and is consistent with the results of cross-linking studies [16] and polarized absorption relaxation measurements [17]. In contrast to the asymmetry of the structure of bovine MF1, MF1 from rat liver, crystallized in the presence of ATP but in the absence of magnesium, has been reported to have a symmetrical structure [14]. As F1-ATPases from most sources seem to be less stable in the absence of bound nucleotides, the enhanced stability of zTF1 [4] provides an opportunity to examine the structure of F1 in its nucleotide-free form. However,

crystals of nucleotide-free TF1 diffract only to 8 Å resolution [18]. In contrast, crystals of the nucleotide-free form of the thermophilic 3 3 subcomplex diffract to 3.2 Å resolution [19] and were used in this study. The structure of the 3 3 subcomplex from Bacillus PS3 shows exact threefold symmetry. The subunits adopt a conformation essentially identical to that of bovine M E. The subunits have similar conformations in both the bacterial and mitochondrial structures, in spite of the differences in nucleotide content and in the presence of the single copy subunits in MF1. A comparison of the 3 3 subcomplex in the two structures will allow the nature of the conformational changes in MF1, associated with a combination of nucleotide-binding and interactions with the , and  subunits, to be established.

Results and discussion
Structure solution and quality of the model

The structure of the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex, crystallized in the absence of nucleotide, was determined by molecular replacement at 3.2 Å resolution. The final model has a crystallographic R factor of 22.2%, and a free R factor of 29.9% (Table 1). The model has good stereochemistry, and 81% of the mainchain torsion angles lie within the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot [20], with a further 19% in the generously allowed regions and no residues in the disallowed regions. The final 2Fo­Fc electron-density map (calculated between 6 Å and 3.2 Å resolution) and the bulk-solvent corrected map (15 Å­3.2 Å) show good density for almost all of the polypeptide chains of the and subunits. There is no interpretable density for amino acids 1­20 of

MF1, the three and three subunits are placed alternately about the axis of the assembly. In the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex, however, there is a crystallographic threefold symmetry axis relating the and subunits. At the top of the assembly, the N-terminal -barrel domains from the and subunits form a crown with pseudo-sixfold symmetry (Fig. 3). Lower down, the pseudo-sixfold symmetry breaks down because the relative orientations of the other domains differ in the and subunits. The complex has a large internal cavity, which in MF1 accommodates part of the subunit. However, even allowing for the absence of the subunit, the cavity is larger in the 3 3 subcomplex than in MF1. This is due mainly to the difference in conformation of the subunits, as described below.
Structure of the subunit

The fold of the bacterial subunit is shown in Figure 4, and is very similar to that of the bovine subunit. Secondary structure elements are labelled in a way that is consistent with the labelling in the mitochondrial structure [13] (Fig. 1). In both structures the subunit consists of three domains: an N-terminal barrel, a central nucleotide binding domain, and a C-terminal -helical bundle. The N-terminal -barrel domain ( 1­82) contains six strands (a­f). Four of these strands (a, b, e and part of d) form a twisted sheet, which faces towards the inside of the subcomplex, and three strands (c, d and f) form an outer twisted sheet; a barrel is formed by the two sheets being joined at either end by loops. In comparison to the bovine subunit, there is an insertion of seven residues ( 36­42; Fig. 1) in the loop between strands c and d (indicated in blue in Fig. 4a). This extended loop enhances the intersubunit contacts by interacting with the neighbouring barrel of the subunit. The nucleotide-binding domain ( 83­354) consists of a nine-stranded sheet (1­9) surrounded by eight helices (B, C and H on one side of the sheet, the rest on the other), and a small additional antiparallel sheet (0 and 2.1). The C-terminal domain ( 355­470) consists of a bundle of six helices. The C-terminal domain is less well ordered than the rest of the subunit structure (the average mainchain temperature factor is 98 Å2 for the C-terminal domain compared to 45 Å2 and 47 Å2 for the nucleotide-binding and N-terminal domains, respectively). There is strong density in the immediate vicinity of the phosphate-binding loop (P loop) [21] which has been interpreted as a sulphate ion (200 mM sulphate was present in the crystallization medium). The conformation of the subunits in the PS3 subcomplex is most similar to that of the nucleotide-free subunit (M E) of mitochondrial F1 (Fig. 5a). The C atoms of these subunits superimpose with a root mean square (rms) deviation of 0.87 Å (for 456 atoms). Residues ( 312­315), corresponding to those in M E that interact with the subunit, have very similar conformations in the PS3 structure, their

The subunits are shown in yellow and the subunits in red, with subunits more distant from the viewer in darker colours. (b) Top view of the complex viewed towards the membrane, the threefold axis points towards the viewer. The N-terminal -barrel domains from the and subunits form a crown with pseudo-sixfold symmetry, shown in bright colours. Towards the outside of the assembly, the pseudo-sixfold symmetry breaks down because the relative orientations of the nucleotide-binding and C-terminal domains differ in the and subunits.

higher temperature factors presumably reflecting the loss of these stabilising interactions. In the structure of MF1, the M DP and M TP subunits have very similar conformations, but that of the M E subunit is quite different. This difference arises from a hinge motion of the lower part of the nucleotide-binding domain and of the entire C-terminal domain; in M E these regions are rotated away from the core of the particle by almost 30° (Fig. 5a). The bacterial subunit superimposes well on either the upper or the lower part of M TP or M DP; in Figure 5a, the upper parts are superimposed and the hinge motion is clearly demonstrated. The upper part of the subunit accommodates the conserved glutamic acid and arginine residues ( Glu190 and Arg191 in PS3 and Glu188 and Arg189 in MF1) which are thought to play an important role in catalysis,
Figure 5 (a)

and the lower part contains the residues involved in nucleotide binding [13]. Therefore, the large hinge motion in the subunits can be thought of as an opening or closing of the catalytic site. The thermophilic subunits and M E are in the open conformation, and the M DP and the M TP subunits adopt the closed conformation.
Structure of the subunit

As observed in the structure of MF1 [13], the fold of the subunit (Figs 4b,d) is similar to that of the subunit (Figs 4a,c). The sequences of TF1 and subunits are about 20% identical [5] (Fig. 1). The subunit also consists of three domains: an N-terminal barrel ( 21­94), a central nucleotide-binding domain ( 95­371), and a C-terminal -helical bundle ( 372­502). As shown in Figures 1

and 4, the major differences in fold are localized in the C-terminal -helical bundle. The subunit has no counterpart of helix 3 of the subunit, and has three helices (6, 7 and 8) at the outer surface in place of helix 6 of the subunit. These additional helices make the appearance of the subunit distinct from that of the subunit when viewed from above (see Fig. 3b). The C-terminal domain of the subunit is the least well-ordered domain in the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex (the average temperature factor for the mainchain atoms is 134 Å2 for this domain, and 41 Å2 and 49 Å2 for the nucleotidebinding and N-terminal domains, respectively), although most residues are clearly recognisable in the electrondensity maps. As in the subunit, there appears to be a sulphate ion bound to the P loop (Fig. 4b). In contrast to the subunit, the bacterial subunit is similar to all three subunits in MF1 (Fig. 5b). The C atoms in the bacterial and mitochondrial subunits superimpose with rms deviations of 1.08 Å for M TP, 1.31 Å for M DP and 1.41 Å for M E (for an average of 470 atoms). Clearly, the conformational changes associated with nucleotide binding and the presence of the single copy subunits in MF1 are smaller in the subunits than in the subunits, where the large hinge motion is present. The conformation of the bacterial subunit is much closer to the closed conformation of the M TP and M DP subunits than to the open conformation of M E and bacterial subunits (Fig. 5).
Conformation of the C-terminal domains in the subunits and

0.5, with the subunit in the M TP conformation gave an R factor of 40.1%. These results strongly suggest that the subunit is in the M E conformation. When the subunit is modelled in this conformation, the R factors for the different conformations of the subunit were 38.5% for M TP, 39.9% for M E and 40.0% for M DP. The differences in R factor are smaller in this case because the subunit conformations are more alike than those of the subunit, but these results support the choice of the M TP, M E model as the correct one. As an additional test, a partial model containing only the N-terminal and nucleotide-binding domains of the M TP and M E subunits was positioned by molecular replacement and partially refined (final R factor 28.1%, free R factor 39.0%). Electron-density maps calculated from this partial model showed density for the C-terminal domain of the subunit that corresponded well to the M E conformation, and there was no additional density that could represent an alternative conformation. The corresponding density for the subunit was weaker, but still accounted for more than half of the residues in this domain. While the density did not discriminate unambiguously between the possible subunit conformations, there was no density to suggest an entirely novel conformation for this subunit. Although at the resolution of the current structure it is not possible to exclude the possibility of some disorder, the results described above provide strong support for a single predominant conformation for both the and subunits. The absence of any interactions between the C-terminal domains of individual subunits, and the absence of the subunit (which interacts with the C-terminal domains of both the and subunits in MF1) both help to explain the increased mobility of these domains in the 3 3 subcomplex.
Catalytic and non-catalytic sites

The very high average temperature factors of the C-terminal domains of the and subunits (98 Å2 and 134 Å2, respectively) raises the possibility that there is more than one discrete conformation of these subunits present in the crystal. In particular, the subunit may be present as a mixture of the M E, M TP and M DP conformations, and the subunit could adopt the M TP, M DP or M E conformations. To test this hypothesis, all nine possible combinations of the MF1 and subunits were subjected to rigid-body refinement. As some combinations of subunits did not give a clear molecular replacement solution, the subunits were initially positioned to provide the best fit to the refined model of the 3 3 subcomplex. Each subunit was divided into three rigid groups, corresponding to the N-terminal, nucleotide-binding and C-terminal domains. Initially, data to 8 Å resolution were included in the refinement, and the resolution was then extended to 4 Å. Regardless of the conformation of the subunit in the initial model, those models with the M E conformation gave R factors between 38.5% and 40.0%, while models with the M TP or M DP conformations gave R factors between 45.7% and 48.6%. Finally, a refinement with both M E and M TP conformation, each at an occupancy of

In the catalytic site of the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex, a sulphate ion is bound at a position occupied by the phosphate of the nucleotide in the mitochondrial M DP and M TP subunits. The sulphate ion is placed above the P loop (GGAGVGKT; 158­165), and is also close to the N-terminal end of helix B ( 163­178) (Fig. 6a). The oxygen atoms of the sulphate interact favourably with NH groups in the mainchain of the P loop residues ( 161­163). The bound sulphate ions in the bacterial and subunits probably help to stabilise the 3 3 assembly. The catalytic site in the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex can be described as being open, because the catalytic residue Glu190 [22,23] (equivalent to mitochondrial Glu188) is remote from the sulphate ion (the distance between Glu190 O1 and sulphate O1 is 10.1 Å). In the M DP subunit, the corresponding distance is 5.7 Å (between Glu188 O1 and the -phosphate O22); in M TP the

This site is mainly in the subunit (yellow), with a minor contribution from the neighbouring subunit (red). The illustrated interactions between Arg191 and Thr338, and between Arg191 and Arg365, are examples of a number of interactions between residues in helix C of the subunit and residues of the subunit. A possible hydrogen bond is drawn as a dotted line. A sulphate ion is present above the P loop and close to the N-terminal end of helix B. The catalytic residue, Glu190, and other residues known to be involved in nucleotide binding or catalysis are also shown in balland-stick representation. (b) The non-catalytic nucleotide-binding site. This site is mainly in the subunit (red), but has several contributing residues from the neighbouring subunit. As in the subunit, a sulphate ion is bound to the P loop. Residue Gln200 (equivalent to mitochondrial Gln208) occupies the position equivalent to the essential catalytic residue Glu190. Some of the intersubunit interactions are shown (as described in the text).

corresponding distance is 5.9 Å. The positions of the catalytic residue Glu190, and of three other residues that are implicated in catalysis or nucleotide-binding are shown in Figure 6a. These three residues, Arg191, Asp252 [24] and Tyr341 [25], correspond to Arg182 in Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (this residue was shown to be essential for catalysis in the study of an F1-ATPase mutant [26]), to M Asp256, which is involved in binding the nucleotide Mg2+ ion [13], and to M Tyr345, which contributes to the adenine-binding pocket [13], respectively. Although the catalytic sites are located at the interface between the and subunits, only a few residues from

the subunit contribute to the catalytic site (Fig. 6a). These residues include Thr338 and Arg365. The latter residue is equivalent to M Arg373, which probably stabilises the negative charge that develops on the terminal phosphate in a pentacoordinate transition state during ATP synthesis [13]. A sulphate ion is bound to the subunit in an analogous way to that found in the subunit (Fig. 6b). The oxygen atoms of the sulphate can interact favourably with NH groups on the mainchain in the P loop ( 172­175), and additionally with the sidechain of Lys175. This sulphate ion in the subunit is more well ordered than the one in

Figure 7 Comparison of the catalytic and non-catalytic site interfaces in the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex with those in mitochondrial F1 (MF1). The bacterial subunits are shown in schematic representation ( subunit in yellow and subunit in red). The C traces of the MF1 subunits that form the most closed catalytic or non-catalytic interfaces are superimposed (M in green and M in red). The views are taken from outside the subcomplex. The close association of the N-terminal -barrel domains and the upper parts of the nucleotide-binding domains are apparent. The helices C and strands 7 in the bacterial and subunits are coloured in cyan as position markers (see text). (a) Stereo view of the catalytic-site interface. The -helical bundle domains and lower halves of the nucleotide-binding domains of the two bacterial subunits are clearly separated, reflecting weak intersubunit interactions between these regions. The M DP (green) and M DP (red) subunits are superimposed. The superposition has been performed on the entire bacterial subcomplex and the equivalent part of MF1. The upper parts of the mitochondrial subunits fit closely to their bacterial counterparts. However, the lower part of M DP is bent radially into the internal cavity and the -helical bundle domain of M DP is displaced towards M DP. Similar structural differences are observed in the active-site interface involving M TP, although to a lesser degree. (b) Stereo view of the noncatalytic site interface. The -helical bundle domains and lower halves of the nucleotidebinding domains of the bacterial and subunits are closer together than in the catalytic-site interface. This reflects more extensive intersubunit interactions. The M DP (green) and M E (red) subunits are superimposed. The upper parts of the

mitochondrial subunits fit closely to their bacterial counterparts, as in (a). The lower part of M DP has been displaced radially into

the internal cavity as in (a), however, the helical bundle domain of M E is displaced slightly away from M DP.

the subunit. Two features of the structure may help to explain this observation. Firstly, the N of Lys175 interacts with the sulphate ion in the subunit, but in the subunit the equivalent residue, Lys164, does not. Secondly, the P loop in the subunit (GDRQTGKT, 169­176) is more well ordered than in the subunit, probably as a result of van der Waals interactions between the sidechains of Arg171 and Gln172 and residues in the neighbouring subunit. The interaction between Gln172 and Arg352 is shown in Fig. 6b. Equivalent interactions are not found in the more glycine rich P loop of the subunit. In the TF1 subunit, Gln200 (equivalent to M Gln208) occupies a position equivalent to that of the catalytic residue Glu190. It has previously been proposed that the absence of the catalytic carboxylate in Gln208 could

explain the lack of catalytic activity of the subunits of MF1 [13], and the same argument can be applied to TF1.
Subunit interfaces

Most of the intersubunit interactions in the catalytic site interface involve residues in the N-terminal -barrel domains and the uppermost part (above helix C) of the nucleotide-binding domain (Fig. 7a). There are, however, a small number of additional contributions from the lower part of the nucleotide-binding domain of the subunit ( Thr338 and Arg365), as described in the previous section. The seven-residue insertion ( 36­42) in the N­terminal barrel forms a series of interactions with the adjacent subunit that are not found in MF1. These interactions include a hydrogen bond between Asn40 and Arg90, and van der Waals interactions between Asn38 and Ser21 and between Glu41 and Met48.

The seven-residue loop may provide a significant contribution to the enhanced thermal stability of TF1. The differences between the three catalytic site interfaces in MF1 are reflected in their buried surface areas, which are 1760 Å2 for E, 2200 Å2 for TP and 3030 Å2 for DP. The catalytic interface in the bacterial 3 3 structure, which has a buried surface area of 2007 Å2, most closely resembles the interface in MF1. In Figure 7a, the M DP interface has E been superimposed on the bacterial 3 3 interface to show the extent of the variability in the catalytic site interfaces. The non-catalytic site interface has a buried surface area of 2076 Å2, very similar to that of the catalytic site interface (Fig. 7). The interactions in the non-catalytic interface primarily involve residues in the N-terminal and nucleotide-binding domains, as observed in the catalytic interface, but additional interactions involving residues in the P loop and the C-terminal helical domain are also present (Fig. 6b). The three non-catalytic interfaces in MF1 vary less than the catalytic interfaces (the buried surface areas are 1890 Å2 for TP­ E, 2280 Å2 for DP­ TP and 2530 Å2 for E­ DP). The non-catalytic interface in the bacterial 3 3 structure most closely resembles the TP­ E interface in MF1. The most closed non-catalytic interface ( E­ DP) is shown in Figure 7b for comparison with the thermophilic enzyme.

The total surface area buried in the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex (12 250 Å2) is significantly lower than in the equivalent part of MF1 (13 690 Å2). These values exclude all interactions between the 3 3 complex and the subunit, which probably enhance the thermostability of TF1 relative to the 3 3 subcomplex.
Implications for the catalytic mechanism of F1-ATPase

The structural homology between the 3 3 assemblies in TF1 and MF1, together with the conservation of key residues at the catalytic site, argue strongly for a common catalytic mechanism for the two enzymes. Because the amino acid sequences of the and subunits are also highly conserved in chloroplast F1-ATPases, their mechanism is also likely to be similar to TF1 and MF1. The thermophilic subunit adopts a very similar conformation to the nucleotide-free M E subunit, demonstrating that this conformation is stable even in the absence of the subunit. It is clear, however, from the kinetic data obtained with the thermophilic 3 3 subcomplex that the subunit is required for catalytic cooperativity [8]. This conclusion is entirely consistent with the idea that rotation of the subunit relative to the 3 3 subcomplex is coupled to the conformational changes in the subunit, as proposed in the binding change catalytic mechanism [1]. The apparent independence of the conformation of the subunit to the presence or absence of nucleotide does not explain the physiological role of nucleotide binding to these subunits.

The entire bacterial 3 3 subcomplex and the equivalent part of MF1 superimpose well in the N-terminal -barrel domains and in the upper part of the nucleotide-binding domains (rms difference of 1.4 Å in 1820 C positions). The upper parts of the nucleotide-binding domains are above strand 7 in both subunits, and terminate at 325 and 338. In the remainder of the nucleotide-binding domains, the differences are more pronounced and are most apparent in the C-terminal -helical domains. The overall rms difference is 1.6 Å for 2227 C atoms (77% of the total of 2856 C atoms). In the M DP and M TP subunits, the lower parts of their nucleotide-binding domains (following strand 7) and their C-terminal domains are displaced radially into the internal cavity, relative to the same parts of the bacterial subunits. The corresponding region in M E is in a similar position to the equivalent part of the bacterial subunit. This displacement is illustrated for M DP in Figures 7a and b. The relative displacement of these regions of M DP and M TP is the major reason for the smaller internal cavity in MF1. Relative to their bacterial counterparts, the lower parts of the nucleotide-binding domains (following strand 7) and the C-terminal domains of all the subunits in MF1 are displaced azimuthally towards the subunits with which they form the catalytic sites. The largest displacement (9 Å) is in M DP and smaller displacements (4 Å and 5 Å, respectively) occur in

Biological implications
F1-ATPase is the catalytic sector of the membranebound ATP synthase that generates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate, using energy derived from a transmembrane electrochemical potential gradient. F1ATPase has the subunit composition 3 3 ; to-date it has only been possible to isolate a stable 3 3 subcomplex of F1-ATPase from the moderately thermophilic bacterium, Bacillus PS3. The 3 3 subcomplex is active, but lacks the catalytic cooperativity exhibited by the 3 3 complex and by F1-ATPase. There is a growing body of evidence in support of rotational catalysis in both ATP synthase and F1-ATPase. According to this model, the relative rotation of the subunit and the 3 3 subcomplex results in sequential conformational changes in the catalytic subunits that are intimately linked to the synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP. The determination of the structure of the nucleotide-free 3 3 subcomplex from Bacillus PS3 contributes to a more general understanding of the conformations that can be adopted by F1-ATPase. This

information should ultimately lead to a clearer understanding of this very unusual catalytic mechanism. The structure illustrates that in the absence of bound nucleotides and the , and  subunits, the 3 3 subcomplex can adopt a symmetrical structure, in marked contrast to the asymmetry observed in the crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial F1. The remarkable similarities in the structures of the bacterial and mitochondrial enzymes are to be expected from the high conservation of amino acid sequence of their subunits. These similarities lend support to the idea that ATP synthases in eubacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts share a common catalytic mechanism.

Materials and methods
Protein purification and crystallization
The purification of the 3 3 subcomplex was based on the procedure described by Miwa and Yoshida [6]. Briefly, and subunits, prepared using an E. coli overexpression system [5], were mixed and incubated at 37°C in the presence of 1.2 M ammonium sulphate (in buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EDTA). The incubated mixture was applied to a hydrophobic column (Toyopearl HW65, Tosoh), and the 3 3 subcomplex was eluted at 0.2 M ammonium sulphate (in buffer B: 10 mM NaPIPES pH 7.0, 0.2 M sodium sulphate) in an inverse gradient between 1.2 M and 0 M ammonium sulphate. Ammonium sulphate was removed by dialysis and the protein solution was concentrated to 20 mg ml­1. Crystals of 3 3 subcomplex were grown at 15°C by the hangingdrop technique. The 10 l drops contained 9­11% PEG 20 000, 0.12 M sodium sulphate, 0.05 M Tris-sulphate buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 mg ml­1 protein, and each 3 ml reservoir contained 11­14% PEG 20 000, 0.12 M sodium sulphate and 0.05 M Tris-sulphate buffer (pH 8.0). Pseudo-dodecahedral crystals (typical dimensions 0.8 mm × 0.6 mm × 0.4 mm) grew in 2­3 weeks. When fully grown, crystals were transferred to a stabilisation solution containing 18% PEG 20 000, 0.2 M sodium sulphate and 0.05 M Tris-sulphate (pH 8.0). Similar crystals could be grown using PEG 6000 as the precipitant, but no stabilisation solution for those crystals was found. The crystals are cubic, space group P213, with a cell dimension of 159.5 Å. Assuming one third of the 3 3 subcomplex (an / dimer) in an asymmetric unit, a value of Vm = 3.2Å3 Da­1 is obtained, which is consistent with values for other protein crystals [27].

model gave a peak 6.0 above the mean (2.1 above the highest noise peak) for TP, while the corresponding values were 5.7 and 2.1 for , and 5.2 and 1.2 for DP. The cross-rotation function was then calE culated for all the dimers in the bovine structure. In this case, the top solution with a peak height 8.5 above the mean (3.5 above the highest noise peak) corresponded to the ( E­ TP) dimer; the second best solution was found for the ( TP­ TP) dimer (corresponding values 6.8 and 1.6) , and the lowest solution was for the ( DP­ E) dimer (corresponding values 5.2 and 0.5). These results strongly suggest that the the dimer in the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex resembles the dimer of E and TP in MF1. The subsequent translation search with the dimer model of E and TP gave a single significant peak, and an R factor of 45.5%. Rigid-body refinement reduced the R factor to 43.3%. The model was mutated to the PS3 sequence in O [32]. Further rigidbody refinement was performed with X-PLOR 3.1 [33], breaking the subunits into domains and, where necessary, secondary structure elements, resulting in a final R factor of 40.6%. The second solution in the dimer cross-rotation functions (using the M TP, M TP dimer) gave significantly higher R factors than the (M E, M TP) dimer in the translation search (by 3%) and the rigid-body refinements (by 5%), and further conventional refinement did not significantly reduce the R factor.

Refinement and final structure model
Conventional refinement was carried out using X-PLOR 3.1, as summarized in Table 1. A strong restraint on B factors (with a weight 100-fold more than the default value) was applied to prevent overfitting. The 2Fo­Fc map calculated at 6­3.2 Å resolution was usually used for checking the model, but occasionally the bulk-solvent corrected map (15 Å to 3.2 Å) [34] was used for looking at the parts with high temperature factors. Initially, the seven residue insertion in the bacterial subunit ( 36­42) was modelled arbitrarily, but after refinement the true conformation was very clear in the electron-density map. The final R factor was 22.2% for 95% of the data between 6 Å and 3.2 Å, while free R factor [35] for the remaining 5% was 29.9%. The final model has rms deviations from ideal values of 0.012 Å for bond lengths, and 1.6 ° for bond angles. The secondary structure elements were identified with the aid of PROCHECK [36]. Structure comparison of the bacterial 3 3 subcomplex and MF1 was carried out with O. Buried surface areas were calculated using programs AREAIMOL and RESAREA in the CCP4 suite.

Data collection
Data to 3.2 Å resolution were collected in oscillation mode on BL18B at the Photon Factory synchrotron at Tsukuba, Japan. The rotation angle and exposure time were 3° and 2 min, respectively, for each frame. A single crystal, mounted without any alignment, provided 60° rotation data (with a redundancy of about 4.6) before radiation damage became apparent. From those data, a complete set of reflections was obtained with AUTO [28], DENZO [29] and programs in the CCP4 suite [30].

Molecular replacement
The search model was the refined model of MF1 [13]. This model has an R factor of 19.4% for 6­2.86 Å data, and satisfactory geometry. The model includes amino acid residues 9­474 for the subunits and 25­510 for the subunits, with individually refined atomic B factors. All data to 4 Å resolution were included in the molecular replacement calculation using AMORE [31]. The cross-rotation function, using each of the bovine subunits in turn as a search model, gave a peak leading to a successful translation search only for the E subunit, with a peak height 4.7 above the mean and 0.8 above the highest noise peak.
