Interactions between MHC molecules and co-receptors of the TCR Rolf König
Genetic experiments indicate similarity between binding sites on MHC class I (MHCI) for CD8 and on MHCII for CD4, but the crystal structures of CD8/MHCI and CD4/MHCII complexes suggest critical differences between the interfaces in the two complexes. Biophysical analyses using ectodomains of co-receptors and MHC molecules demonstrate extremely fast kinetics and low-affinity interactions. Experiments with soluble multimeric MHC ligands suggest that CD4 and CD8 may differ in the mechanisms by which they promote the formation of ternary TCR/MHC/co-receptor complexes. Co-receptor-influenced duration of TCR signaling controls thymocyte selection. In naïve T cells, CD4/MHCII interactions may promote T-cell survival. Temporal and spatial analysis of TCR and CD4 co-clustering in the immunological synapse suggests that CD4 recruitment is regulated by the half-life of the initial TCR/MHCII complex. Diverse experimental systems have yielded conflicting data that have helped to formulate revised mechanistic models of co-receptor function.

The structural basis of interactions between T-cell co-receptors and MHC molecules
Experiments in TCR-independent cellular binding systems first demonstrated the direct interaction between CD4 and MHCII, and between CD8 and MHCI molecules [5,6]. Mutational analyses in combination with cell-adhesion assays revealed that CD8 interacts with a conserved loop in the 3 domain of HLA-A2 [7]. Similarly, functional T-cell assays combined with mutagenesis of murine MHCII demonstrated an analogous CD4-binding region in the 2 domain of I-Ad [8] and, surprisingly, also in the 2 domain of I-Ad [9]. The participation of both 2 and 2 domains in the interaction with CD4 was independently confirmed using linear peptides encompassing the CD4binding loops of HLA-DR [10,11]. Furthermore, synthetic peptides derived from the HLA-DR 1 domain inhibit CD4/MHCII interactions in a lymphocyte-binding assay [12]. Amino acid (AA) substitutions in the corresponding region of the HLA-DR 1 domain disrupt CD4-dependent T-cell function [12].
Sites on CD4 that interact with MHCII The relationship between co-receptor function and ability to bind HIV gp120

Introduction
Co-receptors of the antigen-specific TCR participate in guiding the development and the selection of immature thymocytes [1,2]. Mature T cells that recognize antigen in the context of MHC class I (MHCI) molecules express CD8, whereas T cells restricted by MHC class II (MHCII) express CD4. Direct interactions between co-receptors and MHC molecules have been demonstrated previously (reviewed in [3,4·]). Here I review recent advances in our understanding of co-receptor function that come from diverse experimental approaches. Mutagenesis, crystallographic and kinetic experiments illuminate the structural and biophysical basis for interactions between co-receptors and MHC molecules. These and functional experiments using cells that express mutant co-receptors or MHC molecules deficient in their ability to engage co-receptors have led to mechanistic models of co-receptor function.

Both TCR-independent binding assays and T-cell functional assays in conjunction with mutagenesis of human or murine CD4 molecules suggested that an extended region on the CD4 D1 and D2 domains (the membrane-proximal immunoglobulin-like domains of CD4) interact with MHCII (reviewed in [3]). A still-largely-unresolved issue is whether the binding sites on CD4 for MHCII and HIV gp120 overlap. Early mutational analyses identified the CC region of the CD4 D1 domain as the gp120-binding site (reviewed in [13]), but results from cellular adhesion and T-cell functional assays yielded conflicting conclusions as to the involvement of this site in mediating CD4 interactions with MHCII [3]. An important recent development was the generation of human CD4 mutants displaying a complete loss of gp120-binding capacity while retaining co-receptor function [14··]. Substitution of the human CD4 residue Phe 43 eliminates both gp120 binding and CD4 co-receptor function [14··] and disrupts the development of double-positive thymocytes in transgenic mice expressing only the human CD4 mutant [15]. Importantly, insertion of a Lys residue in the middle of the CC loop preceding the substitution at position 43 partially rescues co-receptor function, but not gp120 binding [14··].
Oligomerization of CD4 and of MHCII

The four-domain extracellular fragment of CD4 crystallizes as a dimer associated via the D4 domains [16]. Evidence of a physiological role for CD4 dimers comes from mutational analysis of the putative dimer interface -- substitution of species-polymorphic mouse CD4 residues

76

Antigen processing and recognition

for the corresponding human CD4 residues disrupts CD4 function [17]. Furthermore, equimolar expression of a mutant CD4 defective in MHCII-binding with wild-type CD4 inhibits CD4/pMHC complex (peptide/MHC complex) interactions and CD4-mediated enhancement of T-cell activation in a dominant-negative fashion [18]. Oligomers of CD4 can also be extracted from freshly isolated lymphocytes and lymphoid cell lines [19]. Independent functional data support a role for CD4 dimerization in T-cell activation [9,18,20,21]. The crystal structures of human and murine MHCII molecules suggest the formation of superdimers, or dimers of dimers, in which two MHCII  heterodimers are aligned in a face-to-face orientation [22­24]. In this superdimer, a combined CD4-binding site may be formed by the 2 domain of one heterodimer in close contact with the 2 domain of the second heterodimer [3,9,11]. Biochemical experiments suggested that preformed MHCII superdimers exist on the surfaces of both mouse and human cells [25,26]. A biochemical demonstration of MHCII superdimers has nevertheless proven to be controversial, because of the potential formation of multimeric complexes between individual heterodimer molecules bound to antibodies used for immunochemical detection [27]. Single-particle fluorescence imaging demonstrated both heterodimers and superdimers of HLA-DR on the surfaces of transfected, living human fibroblasts [28]. However, in this system, spontaneous MHCII superdimer formation can occur in the absence of Ii and HLA-DM; absence of Ii and HLA-DM prevents proper peptide-loading and formation of TCR-stimulatory pMHCIIs. Two very different approaches provided the most convincing evidence for the presence of physiologically functional MHCII superdimers. In the first, quasi-elastic light scattering was used to measure the oligomerization state of TCR and MHCII molecules in solution [29]. Intriguingly, TCR/pMHCII complexes oligomerize only when the correct antigenic peptide is bound to MHCII. The second approach determined the effects of AA substitutions in the putative MHCII superdimer interface upon activation of CD4+ T cells [30··]. This interface consists of three contact areas between the two individual heterodimers [22]. Two contact areas are formed by AA residues 49-55 in the 1 domains (region I), and residues 88 and 111 in the 1 domains (region II), respectively. Contact region III is formed by three salt bridges between AAs from both the -chain (158, 177 and 179) and the -chain (111, 112 and 162). Substitutions in either interface region I or III of HLA-DR1 or I-Ek alone do not affect T-cell activation, but combinations of substitutions in both regions inhibit antigen-specific proliferation and IL-2 production [30··]. An independent study reported that AA substitutions disrupting the salt bridges in contact region III drastically

inhibit IL-2 secretion by an autoreactive T-cell hybridoma [31]. Together, these data suggest that initial recognition of pMHCII complexes by the TCR may be independent of superdimer formation, but that superdimers may contribute to the stabilization of TCR/pMHCII complexes and the formation of the immunological synapse [30··].
The interface between CD4 and MHCII

The complexity of the putative binding sites on CD4 and MHCII molecules prevented a reliable prediction of the CD4/MHCII interface. The structure of the four-domain CD4 fragment and the location of mutations affecting interaction with MHCII suggest that each CD4 monomer interacts with two MHCII units [3]. In an important recent development, the crystal structure of a human CD4 aminoterminal two-domain fragment complexed to the murine MHCII, I-Ak, was solved [32·]. In this crystal, the CD4 D1 domain makes contact with both the 2 and 2 domains of MHCII through three main interaction sites. First, Phe 43 in the C strand of CD4 inserts into a groove formed by a group of hydrophobic residues in the 2 (91, 92 and 178) and the 2 domains (148 and 158). Second, residues 44­46 in the CD4 C strand form an antiparallel mini--sheet with the D strand of the MHCII 2 domain (residues 144­146). Third, the CD4 DE helix makes hydrophilic contacts with the 2 domain (residues 88 and 176). Contrary to previous reports on putative interaction sites within the CD4/MHCII complex that were based on mutagenesis and peptide-inhibition assays [8­11], the CD loops of the MHCII 2 and 2 domains are not involved in mediating the co-structure with the two-domain CD4 fragment [32·]. Importantly, the structure of the co-crystal is also incompatible with the existence of an MHCII superdimer, because two of the putative interface regions in the MHCII superdimer structure also participate in the interface with CD4 [22,32·]. It is possible that these hydrophilic interactions preferentially form under the conditions required for crystallization and do not occur in cells, where restrictions may prevent them (e.g. low concentrations, interactions with additional ligands and structural constraints due to membrane anchoring). Because of the conflicting data arising from crystal structures of MHCII, CD4 and the two-domain CD4 fragment complexed to pMHCII, as well as from mutational and functional analyses, it is still not possible to unequivocally assign contact-mediating AA residues to the CD4/MHCII structure.
Sites on CD8 that interact with MHCI

Crystal complexes between CD8 immunoglobulin-like domains and soluble MHCI molecules [33,34] confirm prior mutational analyses that identified the CD loop in the 3 domain as the major CD8-binding region on MHCI [7,35]. A second contact site, located on the 2 domain, has also previously been suggested [36]. Additionally, the structures are consistent with mutational analyses of CD8 indicating that the binding site for MHCI is located in the

Interactions between MHC molecules and co-receptors of the TCR König

CDR-like loops and the A and B strands [37]. Importantly, in both human and mouse complexes, one CD8 homodimer binds to one pMHCI complex in an asymmetric manner such that one of the CD8 subunits contributes about 70% of the interface with MHCI [33,34]. Furthermore, CD8 binding does not induce conformational changes in the pMHCI surface presented to the TCR. Thus, CD8 co-receptor function is not mediated via modulation of the TCR/pMHCI interaction [33,34]. The details of the structures of both human and mouse CD8/pMHCI complexes have been recently reviewed [4·,38·]. Still unresolved is the structural basis for the enhanced co-receptor efficacy of the CD8 heterodimer compared with the CD8 homodimer [39­42]. Although the CD8 ectodomain interacts with the pMHCI complex [41], it is the CD8 subunit in the CD8 heterodimer that contributes the majority of the binding energy [43]. This is apparent from experiments with COS-7 cells co-expressing CD8 and CD8. Arg at position 4 in CD8 is critical for MHCI binding and contacts the MHCI 2 domain. Expression of single-chain or dimeric forms of CD8 demonstrates wild-type-like adhesion to MHCI+ cells when one Arg 4 residue in a CD8 homodimer is mutated, but elimination of binding in a double Arg 4 mutant. However, co-expression of an Arg 4 mutant CD8 with wild-type CD8 eliminates binding to MHCI [43]. These results suggest a model in which the CD8 subunit binds to both 2 and 3 domains of MHCI, but the CD8 subunit binds only to 3 [43]. Direct binding of the isolated H-2Dd 3 domain to CD8 dimers has recently been reported [44]. This binding depends on the presence of a conserved Glu 227 in the H-2Dd 3 domain. Similar data are not available for CD8.

soluble TCRs do not bind to CD4 by itself in this system [45··]. Two TCR ectodomain constructs, a D10 TCR  ectodomain and a single-chain D10 VV TCR, bind to conalbumin­I-Ak with a Kd  6­8 µM. Important for understanding the nature of CD4 co-receptor function is the observation that binding of soluble pMHCII to immobilized TCR of either form is not affected by the presence of soluble CD4. Thus, binding to CD4 does not induce a conformational change in the pMHCII surface that contacts the TCR. This finding is consistent with observations indicating that CD8 co-receptor function does not alter monomeric TCR affinity for its pMHCI ligand [46,47]. Conversely, Garcia et al. [48] reported, using surface plasmon resonance, increased affinity of the TCR for VSV8/Kb through a reduced koff in the presence of either CD8 or CD8 dimers. Transiently associated CD8 may induce the formation of longer-lived TCR/pMHCI complexes by guiding an energetically favorable docking of the TCR onto pMHCI [48]. Alternatively, a ternary TCR/pMHCI/CD8 complex could provide higher avidity than the TCR/pMHCI complex alone. Independent evidence supporting a role for CD8 in stabilizing TCR/pMHCI interactions comes from TCR photoaffinity labeling experiments on living, cloned, cytotoxic T cells [49]. A soluble, monomeric, photoreactive wild-type pMHCI is >5-fold more effective in labeling TCRs on CD8+ T cells than is an Asp227Lys mutant pMHCI, which cannot bind CD8. Additionally, kinetics of TCR/pMHCI binding are changed by the expression of CD8 on the surface of T-cell hybridomas [49]. A possible explanation for the discrepancies between various experimental systems is that CD8 co-receptor dependency may vary with the affinity of the TCR for its pMHCI ligand. That not all TCR/pMHCI interactions respond equally to the presence of CD8 is also exemplified by binding studies using CD8+ and CD8- T-cell lines that express the 2C TCR. This TCR recognizes diverse peptides associated with syngeneic (H-2Kb) and allogeneic (H-2Ld) MHCI [50]. Monomeric pH-2Kb complexes bind with 10-100-fold higher affinity to CD8+ T cells than they do to CD8- T cells [51·]. On the other hand, pH-2Ld complexes bind only marginally better to CD8+ T cells than they do to CD8- T cells [51·]. Similarly, lysis of target cells presenting pH-2Kb by 2C TCR+ T cells is CD8-dependent, but lysis of pH-2Ld targets is not [51·]. Binding of pH-2Ld complexes to the 2C TCR may be CD8-independent because of the higher affinity of this interaction as compared with the pH-2Kb/2C interaction [50,51·]. A note of caution with regard to the interpretation of equilibrium binding measurements of the interaction between soluble MHC molecules and their ligands was raised by the observation that soluble, `emptied' H-2Ld molecules devoid of antigenic peptide can bind immobilized, recombinant CD8 through the amino terminus of the CD8 co-receptor with an apparent Kd  800 µM [52]. The potential interaction of the MHC peptide-binding groove

Binding kinetics of interactions between T-cell co-receptors and MHC molecules
The effects of CD4 and CD8 on pMHC/TCR interaction

An important tool in understanding the biophysical basis for interactions between co-receptors and MHC molecules is the use of surface plasmon resonance to measure equilibrium binding parameters. Using this technique, Xiong et al. [45··] measured affinity and kinetics of binding between purified ectodomains of CD4, a TCR and its pMHCII ligands. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for binding of soluble pMHCII to the immobilized human CD4 ectodomain is  200 µM. Because a mouse pMHCII construct was used for these binding experiments, the investigators also titrated the soluble human CD4 into a cell/cell adhesion assay between humanMHCII-expressing Raji cells and human-CD4-transfected COS-7 cells. The CD4 concentration that inhibits rosetting by 50% serves as an estimate for the Kd (157 µM). Interestingly, whether or not pMHCII is incubated with specific TCR  ectodomain heterodimers before exposure to immobilized CD4 does not affect the affinity or kinetics of the CD4/pMHCII interaction. Furthermore,

with the amino terminus of the co-receptor can be avoided by using preformed pMHC complexes.
CD4 and CD8 bind with rapid kinetics but low affinity

Human CD8 binds with low affinity (Kd  200 µM at 37°C) to pHLA-A2 immobilized on surface plasmon resonance sensor-chips [47]. Interestingly, the CD8/pMHCI interactions display very rapid kinetics, and equilibrium is reached within 400 ms. Thus, the low affinity of the CD8/pMHCI interaction is not due to an unusually slow association rate constant (estimated kon  1.4 × 105 M-1s-1), but rather to an extremely fast dissociation rate constant (koff  18 s-1) [47]. The apparent Kd for the CD8/pMHCI interaction is very similar to the Kd for the CD4/pMHCII interaction [45··,47]. Similarly, the kinetics of the CD4/pMHCII interaction are extremely rapid [45··]. Interactions between mouse pMHCI (VSV8/Kb) and mouse CD8 (Kd  35­86 µM) or mouse CD8 (Kd  12­67 µM) may be more robust than in the human system [46,48]. Comparison between CD8 and CD8 dimers does not clarify whether the higher co-receptor efficacy of the CD8 heterodimer [39­42] is due to differences in affinity for the pMHCI ligand.
CD8 binding varies with different MHCI alleles

at odds with similar experiments using dimeric and tetrameric pMHCII ligands. These pMHCII complexes bind independently of CD4 co-receptors to MHCIIrestricted TCRs [55­57]. If reflective of physiological differences between CD4 and CD8 function, these observations could be explained by a model in which stable ternary TCR/pMHCI/CD8 complexes form, but CD4 is recruited only after the formation of TCR/pMHCII complexes. However, as mentioned earlier, higher-affinity pMHC/TCR interactions may be independent of co-receptor contributions for stable binding, and it is possible that future studies will identify CD4-dependent pMHCII/TCR combinations.

The role of co-receptors in the selection of the T-cell repertoire
Thymic selection

A comparison of human CD8 binding to various HLA class I isotypes and alleles demonstrated a range of affinities [53·]. Mutational analysis revealed the structural feature of HLA class I molecules that affects the affinity of the interaction with CD8: the conformation of the CD8binding loop formed by AAs 223­229 is conserved between isotypes and alleles that bind CD8 with moderate affinity (Kd  100­220 µM), but differs from the consensus conformation in HLA-A*68, HLA-B*48 and HLA-E. This latter group of HLA class I molecules binds CD8 with Kd  1 mM [53·]. In HLA-A*68 and HLA-B*48, Val and Thr residues, respectively, at position 245 replace the Ala conserved in other isotypes and alleles. It is most likely that steric interference between the bulky side-chains of Val and Thr with the Thr 228 changes the conformation of the CD8-binding loop. In the nonclassical MHCI molecule, HLA-E, the CD8-binding loop differs from the consensus conformation because of AA changes preceding the loop [53·].
Studies using flow cytometry to assess the effects of CD4 and CD8 on TCR/pMHC interactions

Transgenic mouse strains in which mutant MHC molecules lacking the ability to engage co-receptors are expressed on MHCI- or MHCII-deficient backgrounds have demonstrated that thymic selection of mature, single-positive, MHC-restricted T cells depends on the interactions between co-receptors and MHC molecules [58­63]. However, a different system -- expression of mutant I-Ek on an H-2b background in TCR transgenic mice -- failed to demonstrate the need for CD4/Ek interactions for efficient selection of CD4+, I-Ek-restricted T cells [64]. Possibly, CD4/I-Ek interactions are not required for the development of CD4+ T cells expressing the three transgenic TCRs tested (i.e. 2B4, 5C.C7 and AND). Immature, double-positive thymocytes differentiate in vitro into single-positive, CD4- or CD8-expressing thymocytes in relation to the duration of the initial TCR-dependent signal [65··]. Co-receptor-influenced duration of the initial TCR-dependent signaling in immature thymocytes controls CD4 versus CD8 lineage fate. The strength of TCR-mediated signaling is not a determining factor. Apparently, effective CD4/MHCII interactions promote development to the CD4 lineage by increasing the duration of TCR-signaling [65··]. These results also suggest an alternative interpretation of data from transgenic mouse strains with reduced CD4 expression in all T cells [66]. In these mice, selection of CD4+ T cells is decreased with a concomitant increase in CD8+ T cells. Although these data are consistent with the differential avidity model of positive and negative selection [67], they can also be interpreted in light of the differential duration of signaling model suggested by Yasutomo et al. [65··]. Incidentally, Yasutomo's data support the instructional model for T-cell selection and are clearly inconsistent with the alternative model suggesting a stochastic pattern of selection [65··]. Independent support for the instructional model comes from the crystal structure of a TCR complexed with pMHCII [68]. In this structure, a marked difference in TCR docking topology relative to TCR/pMHCI complexes is noted. In the complex, the TCR sits on top of the pMHCII

Multimeric pMHCI ligands and flow cytometry are valuable tools for identifying specific T cells. Binding of multimeric pMHCI ligands to cells expressing either one of two H2-Kb-restricted transgenic TCRs (OT-I and 2C) is CD8-dependent, because anti-CD8 antibodies block TCR/pMHCI interactions in these systems [54]. This interpretation is consistent with earlier surface plasmon resonance data [48] and TCR-labeling experiments using monovalent pMHCI complexes [49,51·], but does not support some surface plasmon resonance data [46,47]. The results obtained with multimeric pMHCI ligands are also

with its V and V regions straddling the MHCII-bound peptide in an orthogonal manner [68], whereas in TCR/pMHCI complexes, the TCR V and V region straddles the peptide in a diagonal manner [69­71]. Differential TCR binding to class I and class II MHC may direct preferential co-receptor engagement [68].
Survival and proliferation of naïve, peripheral T cells

Figure 1 APC

T cell

An interesting, although still controversial, topic is the potential role for co-receptor/MHC interactions in regulating the survival of naïve, peripheral T cells [72,73·,74·]. Results from two disparate systems suggest an essential function for CD4 in maintaining homeostasis in the naïve, peripheral Th-cell compartment. In the first system, survival of naïve CD4+ T helper cells (Th cells) is impaired in peripheral lymphoid organs of transgenic mice that express only MHCII incapable of interacting with CD4 [72,73·]. Decreased survival of CD4+ T cells is independent of whether the CD4+ T cells are selected on mutant MHCII [72] or whether normal CD4+ T cells are transferred into mutant MHCII transgenic mice [73·]. In the second system, CD4-deficient Th cells show diminished survival following adoptive transfer into irradiated hosts [74·]. In both systems, the lack of CD4/MHCII interactions appears to lead to increased apoptosis of Th cells. Data that conflict with this conclusion come from adoptive transfers of CD4+ Th cells into MHCII+ or MHCIIdeficient mice [75,76·]: the survival half-life (t1/2) of transferred CD4+ T cells does not substantially differ in the two environments. A potential cause for this discrepancy is that in MHCIIdeficient mice, neither the TCR nor CD4 can be engaged, whereas in mutant MHCII transgenic and in CD4deficient mice, only CD4/MHCII, but not TCR/MHCII interactions are disrupted. A model in which a signal through the TCR without CD4 engagement by MHCII induces cell death in naïve Th cells, whereas CD4/MHCII interactions promote survival of naïve Th cells, can explain these apparently contradictory observations (Figure 1). Furthermore, MHCII-deficient mice created by gene-targeted homologous recombination may express small amounts of MHCII not detectable by conventional staining techniques [76·]. These minute amounts of MHCII are required for homeostatic proliferation of adoptively transferred CD4+ Th cells in MHCII-deficient, lymphocytopenic unirradiated hosts [76·]. Adoptively transferred CD4+ T cells do not proliferate in unirradiated normal [75,76·] or mutant-MHCII transgenic mice [73·], which are not lymphocytopenic. Blockade of MHCII by antibodies prevents homeostatic proliferation of CD4+ Th cells in lymphocytopenic hosts (TCR/MHCII block), but does not affect Th-cell survival (no CD4/MHCII block) [76·]. Different sites on MHCII mediate interactions with the TCR and CD4, thus the two interactions can be independently blocked by antibodies. The data suggest that a function of CD4 may be to control the size of the peripheral Th-cell pool. In this scenario, signals involving

Current Opinion in Immunology

In naïve, peripheral CD4+ T cells, cell surface receptors regulate homeostasis. In addition to cytokine receptors, the TCR (orange) on T cells and CD4 (dark blue) participate in this regulation. In the proposed model, (a) interactions between the TCR and pMHCII (yellow/green) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that occur simultaneously with CD4/pMHCII interactions promote homeostatic proliferation of donor cells in lymphocytopenic animals (e.g. MHCIIdeficient or irradiated mice). In normal, immunocompetent mice, combined TCR/pMHCII and CD4/pMHCII interactions promote cell survival. (b) If the TCR cannot recognize pMHCII (e.g. CD3­ Th cells or the pMHCII does not bind to the TCR), but CD4/pMHCII interactions take place, naïve CD4+ T cells still survive. (c) However, efficient TCR/pMHCII interactions in the absence of CD4 engagement by pMHCII (e.g. mutant MHCII incapable of binding CD4 [indicated by the red X] or CD4­ Th cells) induces apoptosis in naïve Th cells.

both the TCR and CD4 would induce homeostatic proliferation in lymphocytopenic situations, whereas CD4/ MHCII interactions regulate Th-cell survival and signals transmitted only through the TCR induce apoptosis (Figure 1). Additional support for this model comes from experiments with a mouse strain in which the TCR can be inducibly ablated on mature T cells by Cre-recombinasemediated TCR C gene deletion [77]. Following TCR decay, naïve CD4+CD3- cells disappear from the spleen more rapidly than do CD4+CD3+ cells (t1/2  46 days for CD3- versus t1/2  78 days for CD3+) [77]. However, the CD4+CD3- cells survive considerably longer than do CD4+CD3+ cells in mice that express MHCII only in

The role of co-receptors in ligand recognition and signal transduction
Recently, a minireview presented models for the contribution of co-receptors to the biochemistry of TCR signaling and ligand discrimination [79·]. Insight into the function of co-receptors for T-cell activation stems also from progress in understanding the formation of antigen-specific junctions between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell [80]. The dynamics of this immunological synapse are discussed in detail elsewhere in this issue [81]. Early events in TCR-mediated signaling include the accumulation of CD3 and CD4 in small clusters on the T-cell surface [82··]. Clustering of CD4 depends on TCR-binding to agonist pMHCII and coincides with the initial calcium response, suggesting that TCR/pMHCII recognition initiates recruitment of CD4 to the interface [82··]. Thymocytes expressing the transgenic, MHCII-restricted 3.L2 TCR can develop into the Th-cell lineage even in CD4-deficient mice. However, CD4-deficient 3.L2 T cells fail to stop migration and do not form immunological synapses with planar bilayers containing agonist pMHCII complexes [80]. Similarly, CD4+ 3.L2 T cells incubated with a blocking antibody against CD4 cannot form immunological synapses. Both CD4-deficient and anti-CD4antibody-treated CD4+ 3.L2 T cells interact with agonist pMHCII in a manner similar to CD4+ 3.L2 T cells on antagonist pMHCII [80]. Importantly, proliferative responses of 3.L2 T cells, and also of T cells expressing another TCR with the same specificity (2.102 TCR), to agonist ligands strongly depend on the ability of CD4 to engage MHCII, whereas CD4 association with p56lck is dispensable [83]. Weak agonist ligands, however, require both CD4/MHCII and CD4/p56lck associations to induce proliferation [83]. Together, these data support a kinetic model in which the t1/2 of the TCR/pMHC complex is critical for the recruitment of CD4 [83­85]. TCR binding to agonists, but not to antagonists, supports CD4 recruitment into the immunological synapse. Established CD4/MHCII interactions increase the duration of TCR/pMHCII contacts by promoting and stabilizing the immunological synapse [79·,80] and thus contribute to effective signaling. A similar role can be envisioned for CD8/MHCI interactions. Soluble (s)CD8 completely abolishes activation of CD8-dependent cytotoxic T cells at a predicted steady-state occupancy of MHCI molecules of 1.5%­10.0% [86]. Both the potency of inhibition and the effects of sCD8 on protein phosphorylation events in affected T cells are reminiscent of the effects of antagonistic TCR ligands [86]. Thus, it is likely that if TCR/pMHC interactions failed to recruit co-receptors to bind MHC molecules, abortive or antagonistic signals result.

has helped in formulating and revising mechanistic models of co-receptor function; so have functional experiments using co-receptor-deficient cells or cells expressing mutant co-receptors or MHC molecules selectively deficient in their ability to engage co-receptors, but retaining TCR reactivity. The emerging picture suggests that co-receptor function in thymocyte selection and peripheral T-cell activation is related to the t1/2 of the TCR/pMHC complex. In mature CD4+ T cells, the initial formation of TCR/pMHC complexes is co-receptor-independent, but progression to agonistic activation requires recruitment of co-receptors and their interaction with MHCII molecules in the immunological synapse. The regulation of CD8 recruitment into the immunological synapse is as yet unclear. Additional experiments are required to fully understand the mechanisms by which CD4 and CD8 exert their functions. Crystal structures of the ternary complexes between TCR/pMHC and co-receptors would further clarify the basis for similarities and differences in CD4 and CD8 function. A full characterization of the modulatory effects of co-receptor function on TCR-mediated signaling and of putative, TCR-independent, co-receptor-mediated signaling pathways is required for a full appreciation of the mechanisms by which co-receptors guide antigen-specific T-cell responses.

J Biol Chem 2000, 275:20288-20294. In this report, the authors demonstrate for the first time segregation of human CD4 co-receptor function from gp120 binding activity.

This paper provides the most convincing evidence for a physiological role of pMHCII superdimers. Stimulation of T cells with antigen presented by a panel of human and mouse MHCII-mutant molecules carrying substitutions in the interface region of the putative MHCII superdimer suggests that homotypic MHC association occurs with low avidity. Upon binding to the TCR, pMHCII superdimers stabilize and promote the formation of the immunological synapse. The results suggest an active contribution of MHCII molecules to TCR cross-linking. 31.
