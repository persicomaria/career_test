Abstract A reusable protein seed crystal processed by chemical cross-linking is developed. The process used to achieve crosslinking with glutaraldehyde is described. The lattice constants of the resulting crystals were analyzed using X-ray diffraction, and the characteristics of the seed crystals were investigated using an optical microscope and an atomicforce microscope. The results showed that the lattice constants of the crystalline layer that developed on the cross-linked crystal are identical to those of the as-grown crystal. The layer that grows on the cross-linked seed crystal maintains the same crystallographic direction as the cross-linked crystal. Also, the surface morphology of the crystalline layer is the same as that of the as-grown crystal. Since the cross-linked seed crystals do not dissolve in undersaturated solution, they can be repeatedly used for crystal growth experiments. r 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

geneous nucleation occurs in highly supersaturated solutions, resulting in the formation of many small crystals and polycrystallization that are unsuitable for crystal growth experiments. The addition of a seed crystal to an appropriately saturated solution is one method that can be used to solve this problem. However, it is often difficult to use a seed crystal because protein crystals are usually very

small and fragile. Chemical cross-linking can be used to improve the strength and robustness of protein crystals [1≠3]. In the past, the use of chemically cross-linked protein crystals as seed crystals was not investigated. We optimized the cross-linking procedure for a tetragonal lysozyme crystal with an aim to use as a seed crystal. Crystal growth on the cross-linked seed crystal was investigated in a solution with relatively low supersaturation. The difference in the lattice constants between the cross-linked and nontreated lysozyme crystals was also measured. Epitaxial growth on the surface of the cross-linked seed crystal was observed in situ.

2. Optimization of the chemical cross-linking method The chemical cross-linking method was investigated focusing on the cross-linking reaction time. Lysozyme that had been recrystallized six times (obtained from Seikagaku Kogyo, Japan) was used without further purification. Glutaraldehyde for electron microscopic observation was used for chemical cross-linking. The solution used for chemical cross-linking was prepared by adding glutaraldehyde to a solution containing the same precipitant and buffer agent as the crystallization solution. Sodium chloride and sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) were used. The final concentrations were 2.5 wt% glutaraldehyde, 2.5 wt/vol% sodium chloride, and 50 mM sodium acetate buffer. Glutaraldehyde is known to oligomerize in solutions with pH values from 4 to 8, similar to those often used for crystallizing proteins [4]. Oligomers are known to interfere with chemical cross-linking reaction [5]. Therefore, the solution used for chemical cross-linking was prepared just prior to use. The cross-linking reaction was initiated by adding the cross-linking solution to the protein solution. This reaction occurred at a temperature of 23≠25 1C. If the protein concentration in the chemical cross-linking solution is very high, aggregated proteins may be deposited on the crystal surface and prevent normal crystal growth. To prevent this from occurring, the protein crystal

was soaked in a relatively large volume of chemical cross-linking solution, compared with the volume of residual protein solution. The dissolution of the cross-linked crystal was investigated to optimize the chemical cross-linking reaction time. The cross-linked crystals were soaked in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Since the crystals dissolved in the buffer solution in less than one minute, a 1 h test was considered to be sufficient for checking the solubility of the cross-linked crystals. The crystals were observed in situ using an optical microscope. Fig. 1(a) shows that the cross-linked crystal reacted for 20 minutes dissolved. The surfaces of the cross-linked crystal reacted for 50 minutes dissolved (Fig. 1(b)), and edges of the cross-linked crystal reacted for 80 minutes slightly dissolved (Fig. 1(c)). The cross-linked crystal did not dissolve after 90 min of treatment (Fig. 1(d)). The results of this experiment showed that the lower limit for reaction time to ensure that no changes to the crystal surface occurs, is approximately 90 min. Furthermore, we found that the cross-linked crystal can be preserved for several months provided that it is maintained in a solution containing sodium chloride and buffer agent. Growth tests were also performed on the cross-linked crystals reacted for 90 min or more. The method used for this test is described in

Fig. 2. Growth test. Crystals were cross-linked for various reaction times: (a) 90 min, (b) 6 h, (c) 1 day and (d) 4 days. Scale bar is 500 mm. The cross-linked seed crystals were soaked in a solution containing 40 mg/ml of lysozyme and 2.5 wt/vol% sodium chloride in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at a pH of 4.5. The micrographs were taken after a 10-day incubation at 20 1C.

Section 3.1, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The growth of the cross-linked crystals was found to be greatest at 90 min (a) followed by 6 h (b) and 1 day (c). A 4-day incubation (d) resulted in the lowest crystal growth rate. From this experiment we conclude that nucleation time on the seed crystal increases with reaction times exceeding 90 min, and that treatment in excess of 4 days inhibits nucleation. The optimum reaction time required to achieve chemical cross-linking of the tetragonal lysozyme crystal was, therefore, found to be 90 min.

ide in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) were added to a cell culture dish (9 cm diameter). The dish was then sealed and incubated at 20 1C. Crystals of sufficient size were obtained after 7 days of incubation. The crystals were then chemically cross-linked using the procedure described in Section 2. The cross-linked crystals were soaked in 1 ml of crystallization solution containing 40 mg/ml lysozyme and 2.5 wt/vol% sodium chloride in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). The crystallization dish was then sealed and incubated at 20 1C. The supersaturation of the crystallization solution was maintained at a concentration low enough to prevent homogeneous nucleation over a period of several weeks. The cross-linked crystals were observed using an optical microscope after 40 days of incubation (Fig. 3). Only one crystal was generated in the crystallization solution containing 40 mg/ml of lysozyme (Fig. 3(a)). Fig. 3(b) shows the results of a control experiment carried out in the absence of a cross-linked crystal. Under these conditions, no crystals were generated. Fig. 3(c) shows a magnified image of the crystal shown in Fig. 3(a). The cross-linked crystal can be seen at the center of the crystal. This result shows that the crystal is generated only on the cross-linked seed crystal.

3. Characterization of crystal grown on the crosslinked crystal 3.1. Nucleation control experiment We investigated the effectiveness of the seed crystal prepared by the optimized procedure. A cross-linked crystal was soaked in a low supersaturated solution to check if crystal growth occurred on the seed crystal, and if no other crystals appeared. Tetragonal lysozyme crystals were prepared as follows: 2 ml of crystallization solution containing 60 mg/ml lysozyme and 2.5 wt/vol% sodium chlor-

This indicates that nucleation is enhanced on the seed crystal. It is also shown in Fig. 3(c) that the crystallographic directions of the crystalline layer on the cross-linked seed crystal are the same as those of the seed crystal. Based on the report of McPherson and Shlichta [6,7], who achieved protein epitaxial growth on mineral samples, we consider that epitaxial growth proceeds on the cross-linked seed crystal. This technique results in the growth of a relatively large 5 mm crystal in the crystallization solution containing 45 mg/ml of lysozyme (data not shown).

3.2. X-ray diffraction measurements Lattice constants were measured to investigate the lattice misfit between the cross-linked crystal and the as-grown crystal. To obtain an accurate measurement of the lattice constants differences between cross-linked and non-cross-linked crystals, half of the crystals from a single batch were chemically cross-linked, and the remainders were used as as-grown crystals. Lattice constants were also measured on the layer that grew on the crosslinked crystal. The cross-linked crystal was placed in the same crystallization solution as the noncross-linked crystals, and incubated for 5 days, by which time the crystal layer had reached a thickness of 200 mm.
Table 1 Results of the X-ray diffraction analysis

The crystals were then mounted on glass capillaries in preparation for X-ray diffraction analysis, which was carried out at the BL-18B of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. Diffraction data were collected by the oscillation method, using an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector at a ∞ wavelength of 1.0 A. When analyzing the crystal layer that developed on the cross-linked crystal, we adjusted the position of the crystal so that the Xray beam irradiated only the crystal growth layers. Lattice constants were analyzed using an HKL2000 [8]. The results of this analysis are shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, chemical cross-linking caused slight changes in the lattice constants (compare ccl-1,2,3,4 with ag-1,2,3). The lattice constants of the a- and b-axis increased only ∞ slightly, by 0.04 A (0.05%), while the lattice ∞ constant of the c-axis decreased by 0.16 A (0.42%). However, it was found that the lattice constants of the crystalline layers that developed on the cross-linked seed crystal (gl) are identical to those of the as-grown crystals (ag-1,2,3). These results indicate that the lattice misfit between the grown layer on the cross-linked crystal and the cross-linked seed crystal is counteracted. The fact that the crystalline layers developed on the cross-linked seed crystal are able to grow as a single crystal means that this counteraction works positively to cancel the lattice misfit.

3.3. In situ observation of crystal growth on crosslinked seed crystals In situ observation of crystal growth on the cross-linked seed crystals using both an optical microscope and an atomic-force microscope was conducted. The cross-linked crystal was placed in a protein solution containing 75 mg/ml of lysozyme and 2.5 wt/vol% sodium chloride in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer adjusted to a pH of 4.5. Crystal growth on the cross-linked crystal proceeded at room temperature (23 1C). A crystallization cell was prepared for macroscopic observation with an optical microscope. The cell was composed of two slide glasses and a 500 mmthick silicon sheet with a quadrangular 10 ¬ 10 mm2 hole. Fig. 4 presents a schematic diagram of the apparatus used for observation with the optical microscope. The upper {1 1 0} face of the crystal was observed using transmission light by focusing on the upper surface of the crystal. Changes in the morphology of the upper surface of the cross-linked crystal with time are

shown in Fig. 5. The appearance of the crystal at commencement of the experiment is shown in Fig. 5(a). Fig. 5(b) shows crystal islands generated on the surface of the cross-linked crystal. These crystal islands grow larger in size in Figs. 5(c) and (d). The crystal islands then coalesce (Fig 5(e)), and finally the surface of the cross-linked crystal is covered with a crystal layer (Fig. 5(f)). Magnified micrographs showing the crystal at various stages of development are shown in Fig. 6. The crystallographic directions of the generated crystal islands are the same as those of the seed crystal. The crystal islands combine smoothly, without forming gaps, to produce a single crystal. In Fig. 5 both clear and obscure lines are visible. The clear lines represent lines that are well focused, indicating that they are present on the upper surface of the cross-linked crystal. The obscure lines are out of focus, and are present at the interface between the cross-linked crystal and the slide glass. Fig. 7 shows the crystal photographed using an atomic-force microscope. The surface morphology

of the cross-linked crystal prior to crystal growth is shown in Fig. 7(a). This figure shows many etch pits on the surface of the cross-linked crystal. These etch pits are probably formed as a result of the chemical cross-linking reaction. The chemical cross-liking solution contains few protein molecules, and, therefore, we believe that dissolution occurs simultaneously along with the chemical cross-linking reaction, soon after the crystals are placed in the chemical cross-linking solution. The photographs obtained using an atomicforce microscope were similar to those shown in Fig. 6. The crystal islands generated on the surface of the cross-linked crystal are shown in Fig. 7(b). These islands increase in size (Fig. 7(c)) until the surface of the cross-linked crystal is entirely covered with a crystal layer (Fig. 7(d)). The surface morphology of the crystal layer shown in Fig. 7(d) is similar to that observed for the asgrown crystal (Fig. 7(e)). This result suggests that the methods applied here can be used to produce normal crystals.

4. Conclusion Tetragonal lysozyme crystals were chemically cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to produce a reusable seed crystal. It is found that the crystal layer that developed on the cross-linked crystals has the following characteristics: (i) The layer that grew on the cross-linked seed crystal maintained the same crystallographic direction as the cross-linked crystal. (ii) The lattice constants of the crystalline layer that developed on the cross-linked crystal was identical to those of the as-grown crystal. (iii) The surface morphology of the crystalline layer was also similar to that of the as-grown crystal. Therefore, it can be concluded that the crystal layer that grew on the

cross-linked crystal had characteristics very similar to those of the as-grown crystals, and that the crosslinked crystals can be used as seed crystals. The use of cross-linked crystals as seed crystals enables us to generate large single protein crystals at the desired position in the crystallization chamber, and with the desired crystallographic directions. Moreover, the cross-linked crystal can be used many times, since it does not dissolve in under saturated solutions. Using this method, crystal growth data can be obtained easily with high reproducibility.
