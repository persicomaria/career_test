Activation of Bacillus licheniformis a-amylase through a disorder ® order transition of the substrate-binding site mediated by a calcium­sodium­calcium metal triad
Mischa Machius1*, Nathalie Declerck2, Robert Huber1 and Georg Wiegand1*
Background: The structural basis as to how metals regulate the functional state of a protein by altering or stabilizing its conformation has been characterized in relatively few cases because the metal-free form of the protein is often partially disordered and unsuitable for crystallographic analysis. This is not the case, however, for Bacillus licheniformis -amylase (BLA) for which the structure of the metal-free form is available. BLA is a hyperthermostable enzyme which is widely used in biotechnology, for example in the breakdown of starch or as a component of detergents. The determination of the structure of BLA in the metal-containing form, together with comparisons to the apo enzyme, will help us to understand the way in which metal ions can regulate enzyme activity. Results: We report here the crystal structure of native, metal-containing BLA. The structure shows that the calcium-binding site which is conserved in all -amylases forms part of an unprecedented linear triadic metal array, with two calcium ions flanking a central sodium ion. A region around the metal triad comprising 21 residues exhibits a conformational change involving a helix unwinding and a disorderorder transition compared to the structure of metal-free BLA. Another calcium ion, not previously observed in -amylases, is located at the interface between domains A and C. Conclusions: We present a structural description of a major conformational rearrangement mediated by metal ions. The metal induced disorderorder transition observed in BLA leads to the formation of the extended substratebinding site and explains on a structural level the calcium dependency of -amylases. Sequence comparisons indicate that the unique Ca­Na­Ca metal triad and the additional calcium ion located between domains A and C might be found exclusively in bacterial -amylases which show increased thermostability. The information presented here may help in the rational design of mutants with enhanced performance in biotechnological applications.

Introduction
Metal ions serve a variety of functions in proteins. These ions can be directly involved in catalytic processes during an enzymatic reaction or can participate in electron transfer or redox reactions. Often, however, metal ions fulfill a purely `structural' role in the way that they stabilize a macromolecular conformation required for biological function [1]. Such metal ions can be found at domain­domain interfaces or between residues far apart in sequence. When located on the surface of proteins, metal ions can contribute to interactions leading to the formation of complexes with other proteins or membranes. The detailed characterization of the structural transitions induced by metal binding, however, often proves difficult as metalfree proteins are usually less stable and therefore hard to crystallize [2]. Analyses where the structure of the metalfree form of a protein can be directly compared to the structure of the metal-containing form are therefore rare

and usually limited to examples where loss of the metal does not result in the disordering of large regions. Such a case is given by concanavalin A, one of the best studied examples [3], where metal removal leads to a series of minor structural rearrangements in this protein resulting in a decrease in substrate-binding affinity. For smaller proteins, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques combined with X-ray crystallography have been successfully applied to study structural transitions in metalcontaining proteins like calmodulin [4], E-cadherin [5] or calbindin [6]. The most abundant of the structural metals is calcium, probably because it does not require a strict and specific coordination geometry [1]. The coordination is rather dominated by the spherical symmetry of the peripheral electrons and is optimized by packing as many ligands as possible around the cation. This structural flexibility is

probably the reason why calcium is found as a central messenger in signal transduction. In this way, the action of a whole variety of proteins can be regulated by modulating the active calcium concentration as the functionality of calcium-binding proteins usually depends on whether calcium is bound or not [7]. -Amylases (-1,4-glucan-4-glucanohydrolases; E.C. 3.2.1.1) are classical calcium-containing enzymes which constitute a family of endo-amylases catalyzing the cleavage of -D-(14) glycosidic bonds in starch and related carbohydrates with retention of the -anomeric configuration in the products. These enzymes can be found in microorganisms, plants and animals where they play a dominant role in carbohydrate metabolism. -Amylases and related amylolytic enzymes are widely used in biotechnology for starch degradation and in synthetic chemistry for the formation of oligosaccharides by transglycosylation [8]. Furthermore, these enzymes are used as targets for drug design in attempts to treat diabetes, obesity and hyperlipemia [9]. It has long been known that -amylases require calcium for their enzymatic activity [10]. All known structures of holo -amylases show a common calcium-binding site stabilizing the interface between the highly homologous central A domain and the more variable B domain [11]. Binding of calcium to this site is very strong with a dissociation constant in the picomolar to nanomolar range [12]. The distance of this conserved calcium to the catalytic center precludes a direct involvement in the reaction mechanism so that its role is assumed to be structural. It can be shown that -amylases undergo reversible transitions from the active to the inactive state upon removal of calcium with chelators [10], although a detailed structural description of this process has not yet been presented. Some -amylases contain other calcium-binding sites which are not conserved [12,13]; whether these additional calcium ions are required for stabilization or regulation is not known. The previously determined structure of the calciumdepleted -amylase from Bacillus licheniformis (BLA), is the only known structure of the apo form of an -amylase [11­14]. It could be shown that upon adding calcium chelators the stability of BLA is drastically decreased [15] and the susceptibility against proteolysis markedly increased [11]. We report in this paper the crystal structure determination of the holo form of BLA at 1.9 Å resolution. The entire structure is well defined, including 11 residues in domain B which are disordered in metal-free BLA. A calcium ion is present at the location homologous to the common calcium binding site in -amylases. Comparison with the apo form of BLA shows that binding of calcium leads to a

major conformational change in a region comprising 21 residues. A disorderorder transition leads to the formation of one wall of the cleft in the interface between domains A and B which contains the extended substratebinding site and thus explains the structural basis of calcium-mediated activation of -amylases. The conserved calcium-binding site in BLA is part of a novel metal-binding motif with two calcium ions in close proximity to a central cation. We present evidence that the central cation is sodium, which is known to have stabilizing and activating effects on some -amylases. A third calcium ion, which has not previously been observed in structures of amylolytic enzymes, is located in the interface between domains A and C. Sequence comparison reveals that this calcium ion as well as the metal triad are most probably conserved in certain Bacillus -amylases which show increased thermostability.

Results and discussion
Structure determination

The structure of holo BLA (Figure 1) was solved by Patterson search techniques, using the structure of apo BLA as a search model, and subsequently refined to a resolution of 1.9 Å. The statistics for the refinement of BLA are summarized in Table 1. Apart from the N-terminal alanine residue and a few sidechains on the surface of the protein, the electron density is well defined for the entire model. The quality of the electron-density map is indicated in Figure 2 which shows a difference Fourier map for part of the newly ordered region around the metal-binding site in domain B. The final model contains 482 residues, 222 solvent atoms, three calcium ions and one sodium ion and is characterized by a free R factor of 18.5% (crystallographic R factor = 15.4%) and excellent geometry. Application of a procedure which models the contribution of unordered solvent to the intensity of the reflections (so-called bulk-solvent correction) improved both the crystallographic and the free R factor by about 2%, although we found that the quality of the electron density did not change significantly whether bulk-solvent correction was included in map calculation or not.
Identification of the metal ions

The location and nature of the metal ions in BLA were determined crystallographically. With high-precision data, well ordered calcium atoms can yield a clear anomalous signal when using CuK X-rays. For the region of the triadic metal-binding site, Figure 2b shows both a difference Fourier and an anomalous difference Fourier electron-density map, calculated with phases from the refined BLA model prior to including the metal ions and water molecules at the metal-binding site. One of the peaks in the anomalous difference Fourier map (with a height of 8.6) coincides with the position of the calcium ion which is conserved in all known structures of -amylases and related amylolytic enzymes. Another peak (11.4) was

found in domain B about 8 Å away from the conserved calcium ion. Finally, a third peak (7.3) could be located in the interface between domains A and C. These peaks were all interpreted as calcium ions because they also show the appropriate stereochemical characteristics. The conserved calcium ion is designated calcium I, the second calcium ion in the metal triad is designated calcium II, and the third calcium ion in the interface between domains A and C is designated calcium III. The presence of an atom located between the two calcium ions in domain B was clearly visible in the difference Fourier map (Figure 2b). We believe that this peak represents a sodium ion, rather than a water molecule or a lowoccupancy calcium ion for the following reasons. The ligand sphere comprises six oxygen atoms (five coming from aspartate sidechains and one from a carbonyl oxygen), four of which are located within 2.5 Å of the central atom. The distances of the surrounding oxygen atoms are characteristic for sodium which was included in high concentrations during purification. Refinement as sodium resulted in a B factor of 18.3 Å2 for this atom, which is equal to the B factors of the liganding atoms, whereas the B factor assuming a water molecule is 8.6 Å2. Finally, in an attempt to replace the sodium ion by

rubidium, a BLA crystal was transferred into a sodium-free buffer containing 100 mM rubidium chloride. The resulting difference Fourier map for this crystal showed only very weak density at the position of the presumed sodium ion (data not shown).
Overall structure of BLA

The general structure of BLA (Figure 1) is characterized by three distinct domains with overall topologies similar to those found in all known structures of -amylases and related amylolytic enzymes. The central N-terminal domain (A domain) folds into a (/)8 barrel and comprises residues 1­101 and 203­396. This domain is structurally the most well conserved domain in -amylases [11]. Loops with varying complexity connect the helices and strands of the barrel and, on the C-terminal side of the barrel contain the active site, the conserved calciumbinding site and, in some mammalian -amylases, a chloride-binding site. The C-terminal domain (C domain; residues 393­483 in BLA) invariably contains a Greek key motif. This domain is generally also very well conserved in amylolytic enzymes except in barley -amylase, where it is significantly smaller [13].

 sheet. The short  helix which occurs in domain B of most -amylases, and which is involved in forming the extended substrate-binding site, is not present in BLA, as is the case for barley -amylase. Instead, BLA contains a pronounced loop the stem of which is wound around the novel Ca­Na­Ca metal triad. The ligands for this metal triad come almost completely from residues in domain B with only two interactions established with residues from domain A. The third calcium ion (calcium III) in BLA is located in the interface between domains A and C (Figure 1). This calcium ion has not been observed previously in the structures of other -amylases. The ion bridges two loops in domain C with a large loop in domain A. The position of calcium III on the C-terminal side of the central (/8) barrel is directly opposite to the hinge region where domain A joins domain C, and thus provides a second major anchor point for the interaction between these two domains. Evidence for the existence of a chloride-binding site in BLA homologous to that found in mammalian -amylases was mentioned previously [11]. In the present study, however, no indication for such a chloride ion could be found.
Structure of the metal-binding sites in BLA

The detailed structures of the metal-binding sites in BLA are depicted in Figures 2 and 3, and all metal­ligand distances are listed in Table 2. The three metal ions in domain B form a linear array with calciums I and II located 4.1 Å and 4.5 Å from the central sodium ion. A total of 11 residues plus two water molecules make 20 interactions with the metal ions (seven interactions with each calcium ion and six interactions with the sodium ion). The cage surrounding the metal ions contains six aspartate residues and is highly negatively charged. Of the 20 ligand atoms, 13 come from aspartate sidechains. Each metal ion binds one of the aspartates in a bidentate mode and shares two aspartate residues with the neighboring metal ion. The remaining ligands are four carbonyl oxygen atoms and one asparagine OD1 atom as well as a water molecule flanking each of the calcium ions. The coordination geometry of both calcium ions in the metal triad can be described as a distorted pentagonal bipyramid and idealized as an octahedron, as is found for most calcium ions in proteins. In a scheme devised to systematically describe the coordination geometry of calcium ions, the vertices of this octahedron are designated x, y, z and ­x, ­y, ­z with x, y, ­x and ­y defining the central plane [1­12]. If the invariant carbonyl oxygen atom, which is found to ligand all calcium ions in proteins is placed at the ­y position, the ligand at ­z is generally an aspartate sidechain binding in a bidentate mode. The ligand in

A third domain, domain B, is established as a protrusion from domain A. This is the least similar domain in -amylases, varying from a relatively short (~60 residues) loop-like structure with little regular secondary structure in the -amylase from Aspergillus oryzae to a complex multistrand domain with over 100 residues in BLA. In BLA, domain B is characterized by two long central  strands (residues 111­121 and 133­140) which wind around each other in a double-helical fashion. The C-terminal portion of the longer strand is capped by a shorter antiparallel strand (residues 124­128). Four more antiparallel  strands are located underneath the central portion of the long strand forming a right-handed twisted five-stranded

position +z is usually either a carbonyl oxygen or an aspartate binding in monodentate mode. Both calcium-binding sites in domain B of BLA follow this scheme.

In contrast to calcium-binding sites in proteins, a similarly well described picture for the coordination geometry of sodium binding sites has not emerged. The presumed

We describe for the first time a specific sodium-binding site in an -amylase, although it has been known for rather a long time that sodium enhances the stability and enzymatic activity of some -amylases, including BLA [16­20]. The observed stabilization is, however, only moderate and although accurate binding constants have not been determined the affinity for sodium seems to be relatively weak. This is corroborated by our attempt to replace the sodium ion by rubidium, as described above, where we find little electron density at the presumed sodium-binding site in the absence of sodium in the buffer. There are no changes in the detailed structure of the surrounding calcium ligands in the absence of sodium. The structural flexibility of the triadic metal-binding site is apparently high enough to allow sodium to freely diffuse out of its binding pocket. A rubidium ion can, however, not be accommodated. It appears that the observed stabilization of BLA by sodium is due to a further stabilization of the two neighboring calcium ions in domain B by the formation of a metal triad, neutralizing the pronounced negatively charged environment. Further experiments are necessary to elucidate the complex metal-binding behavior of BLA and its influence on protein stability and enzymatic activity. A striking feature of the cage surrounding the metal triad is the presence of an unusual cis peptide bond between Trp184 and Glu185 (Figure 4). The glutamate sidechain establishes an ionic interaction with Lys276, which most likely stabilizes the cis peptide conformation. The cis peptide bond is located between residues liganding the metal ions, suggesting that the cis conformation is important for the correct structure of the metal-binding site. Calcium III at the interface between domains A and C is heptacoordinated with three aspartate sidechain atoms, three carbonyl oxygen atoms and one water molecule serving as ligands (Figure 3). In contrast to calcium ions I

and II, the coordination geometry of calcium III is unique for -amylases in that the position trans to the bidentate aspartate (position +z) is occupied by a water molecule.
Metal-mediated structural transitions in BLA

Asp164 is rotated by ~180° and makes an ionic interaction with Arg125. The conserved calcium ion is liganded by four residues in all structures of amylolytic enzymes. Three of these residues are strictly conserved both within the amino acid sequence and structurally. For BLA, they could be identified as Asn104, Asp200, and His235 by a structure-based sequence alignment [11]. The fourth ligand, however, is not conserved and could not be deduced from sequence comparisons. This residue was expected to belong to the region which is disordered in apo BLA [11] and could now be identified as Asp194, which also binds to the central sodium ion. Other structural changes between holo and apo BLA can only be found around calcium III. In metal-free BLA, the position of calcium III is occupied by a water molecule. In apo BLA, the sidechain of His406 is rotated by ~180° establishing a hydrogen bond to this water molecule and replacing the water molecule which ligands calcium III in the metal-bound form. The driving force for the structural transition induced by loss of the metal ions is most likely to be the high density of negative charges in the triadic metal-binding site. Removal of the counterbalancing positive charges of the metal ions will result in a strong electrostatic repulsion between the liganding acidic sidechains. It has been observed that apo BLA becomes nicked after Glu189 by a glu-C endopeptidase which is co-secreted by B. licheniformis [11]. This nicking is a biochemical confirmation of the disruption of the local structure in domain B which leads to an increased susceptibility to proteolysis. After nicking, however, BLA is apparently still able to bind calcium ions because the addition of calcium leads to the cracking of apo BLA crystals [11]. Whether or not nicked BLA is enzymatically active in the presence of calcium and sodium has not been investigated.

Differences between the structures of the metal-free form and the metal-containing form of BLA can be found in the regions around the metal ions. The most striking of these differences is the ordering of the segment between residues 182 and 192, which contains a metal-liganding residue (Asp183) and the cis peptide bond between Trp184 and Glu185. In the metal-free form of BLA, the corresponding region is completely disordered. The newly ordered residues form a large loop-like structure which is positioned between domain A and the complex  sheet in domain B, partially filling the large space between these two domains (Figures 1 and 5). BLA and barley -amylase differ in this respect from other -amylases which contain a short helical segment in this position. In addition to the disorderorder transition, the segments adjacent to the newly ordered region exhibit drastically different conformations depending on whether metal ions are bound or not. The segment comprising residues 178­182 is characterized by a dislocation of the mainchain so that an ionic interaction between Lys180 and the metal-liganding Asp202 can be established, indicating the importance of this interaction for the stabilization of the metal-ligand sphere. Residues 193­199 adopt a helical conformation in apo BLA, but become unwound and wrapped around the metal ions in a rather irregular fashion in holo BLA. This extended conformation, which is presumably energetically less favorable compared to the helical conformation, is stabilized by the presence of the metal ions and a strong hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Tyr195. In the metal-free form, however, the sidechain of

Calcium activates a-amylases by forming and stabilizing the extended substrate-binding site

-Amylases interact with their polymeric substrates (starch and related compounds) via multiple binding sites on the enzyme surface. One of these sites is the extended substrate-binding site at the catalytic center. This site has been thoroughly characterized in porcine pancreatic -amylase (PPA) and was shown to bind up to seven sugar rings [21­23]. In PPA, the 19 residues which establish interactions with sugar atoms at the extended substratebinding site are located in the interface between domains A and B (16 residues coming from domain A and three residues coming from domain B). Many sugar-binding residues in PPA, especially those from domain A, are conserved among -amylases facilitating their identification in other members of the amylase superfamily. In contrast, the identity of sugar-binding residues belonging to domain B is not easily deduced from sequence alignments, because of the pronounced differences in this domain of different amylolytic enzymes. Furthermore, it is expected that the number of sugar rings binding to the extended substratebinding site and the detailed structural interactions vary in -amylases from different organisms. Although a crystal structure of BLA in the presence of carbohydrates is not available, structural features important for sugar binding in BLA can be deduced from comparing the structure of BLA with the structure of a complex formed between PPA and the pseudo-octasaccharide V-1532 [23] (Figure 6). V-1532 is a trestatinderived -amylase inhibitor containing four glucose moieties and two acarviosine units which cannot be cleaved by -amylases. Of the 19 sugar-binding residues in PPA, 18 superimpose with equivalent residues in BLA, with ten of these residues from domain A and one residue from domain B being conserved (Table 3). Three residues in domain B of BLA correspond to residues in PPA which

form one wall of the extended substrate-binding site. In the present study, we show that these residues are in close proximity to the calcium ion which seems to be conserved in all -amylases (calcium I) and are only ordered when this calcium ion is present. Calcium binding therefore controls the formation of the extended substrate-binding site, thus establishing the enzymatic competence of BLA. Such a metal-mediated formation of the extended substratebinding site might be a way of preventing the enzymatic activity of secreted -amylases before export from the cytoplasm, thus avoiding deleterious activity inside the cell. This hypothesis is supported by a recent investigation of the folding pathway of the homologous -amylase from Bacillus subtilis. This enzyme seems to exist in a partially folded state within the cell adopting its completely folded state only after secretion. The folded state is attained with the assistance of calcium which is at a much higher concentration on the external side of the cytoplasmic membrane [24].
The metal ions in BLA and thermostability

Structural analysis of the coordination geometry of the metal triad in BLA suggests that only proteins that are closely related to this enzyme are likely to contain the unique ternary metal-binding site. This special feature is therefore probably confined to -amylases from Bacillus, especially those from B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens (BAA; 81% identity, 88% similarity to BLA) and B. stearothermophilus (BStA; 66% identity, 77% similarity to BLA) where all of the metal ligands are conserved (a sequence alignment is presented in [11]). All three of these enzymes show increased thermostability with BLA being a hyperthermostable enzyme. BLA is therefore widely used in biotechnology for the breakdown of starch and other complex carbohydrates at temperatures of up to 110°C, and is also used as a component of detergents and an additive in baking [25].

conformation of a protein often contains disordered regions which become ordered through the binding of cofactors. Structural metal ions can mediate such disorderorder transitions, because the removal of metal ions frequently destabilizes part of a protein due to the mutual repulsion of the predominantly negatively charged metal ligands once the balancing positive charges of the metal ions are lost. Such a metalmediated activation mechanism seems to be utilized in many secreted enzymes which are loaded extracellularly with the metal ions, perhaps to prevent unwanted intracellular enzymatic activity. A classical example is given by -amylases which have an absolute requirement for calcium for stability and catalytic competence. The determination of the crystal structure of hyperthermostable Bacillus licheniformis -amylase (BLA) provides a rare example where the structure of the metal-containing active form of an enzyme can be directly compared with the structure of the metalfree inactive form. A large region, comprising 21 residues, undergoes a structural rearrangement and a disorderorder transition induced by calcium binding. This region contains part of the extended substratebinding site and the calcium ion which is highly conserved in -amylases. We demonstrate that this calcium ion is crucial for the correct conformation of the extended substrate-binding site, thus explaining on a structural level how calcium activates -amylases and related amylolytic enzymes. In BLA, a second calcium ion is located close to the conserved calcium ion which, in the presence of sodium, forms an unusual linear Ca­Na­Ca array surrounded by a highly negatively charged cage. This triad, which is a deviation from the standard scheme of metal binding in -amylases, together with a third novel calcium ion at the interface between two domains seem to occur exclusively in some thermostable bacterial -amylases. These two features of the thermostable enzymes are very likely to be key determinants of their increased resistance against thermal inactivation compared to their mesophilic homologs.

The structural features which render the three Bacillus -amylases more thermostable than their mesophilic counterparts, and render BLA hyperthermostable compared to the highly homologous but less thermostable BStA and BAA, have been extensively investigated, partly because of the technological importance of these enzymes [15,26­32]. A detailed understanding of the unfolding/refolding characteristics has not, however, been achieved. The importance of calcium for the stability of these three bacterial enzymes is clearly established. In fact, the inclusion of calcium chelators is often used in thermostability assays in order to reduce the unfolding temperature to technically manageable values [32]. However, the presence of the triadic metal array in BLA as well as the novel third calcium ion in the interface between domains A and C is unexpected. These special structural features are most likely to be key determinants of the increased stability of the three Bacillus -amylases and need to be taken into consideration in attempts to rationally design BLA mutants with enhanced performance in biotechnological applications.

Materials and methods
Crystallization
A BLA variant containing the mutations N190F, Q264S and N265Y was constructed as described earlier [33]. This variant has a half-life for thermal inactivation which is increased by a factor of about 12 compared to the wild type (MM, ND, RH and GW, unpublished results). Purified protein was crystallized by vapor diffusion from drops containing 4 µl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) plus 4 µl of reservoir solution (50 mM Hepes, 1 M ammonium sulfate, 1% (v/v) PEG 500, pH 7.0) equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 20°C. Hexagonal bipyramids appeared after three to ten days and grew to a final size of 0.5 mm in length within one to three weeks. The crystals belong to space group P61, with cell constants of a = b = 91.3 Å, c = 137.7 Å, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

Biological implications
The stabilization and interconversion of conformations representing different functional states of macromolecules is a critical determinant of molecular recognition processes which are very often regulated through specific stimuli. Some proteins, such as many of those involved in signal transduction processes, serve as `molecular switches' and interconvert between only two functional states, whereas others display a wide range of activity (e.g. allosteric enzymes).

X-ray data collection
Diffraction data up to 1.7 Å Bragg spacing were collected on a MARresearch image plate system using CuK radiation and a beam focussing mirror system (MSC, USA). Data were reduced with the DENZO/SCALEPACK package version 1.6.3 [34]. Details of the data collection statistics are listed in Table 1.

Patterson search
The structure of native BLA was solved using Patterson search methods using the structure of the metal-free form of BLA [11] as a search model. BLA used for the structure determination of the metalfree form differs at two positions compared to the protein used in the presented study (serine instead of glycine at position 310 and alanine instead of serine at position 320 [35,36]). These two differences plus the mutations at the positions 190, 264 and 265 do not noticeably influence the overall structural characteristics of BLA. To avoid model bias, the residues near the disordered region (177­197) as well as the residues around the mutation site (260­270) were removed from the search model. The Patterson search was performed with X-PLOR version 3.581 [37]. A rotation function, calculated with data in the resolution range between 10 and 4 Å, gave a clear solution with 9.4 (the next highest solution had a signal of 4.4). For the translation function, data between 10 and 3 Å were used, yielding a solution with 42.3 (the next highest solution had a signal of 23.6).

Structure refinement
Refinement was carried out with the program X-PLOR version 3.851 [37] using the parameters of Engh and Huber [38] and included a bulksolvent correction. No hydrogen atoms were included in the model. Refinement started at a resolution of 3 Å with a simulated annealing at 2000K in order to remove model bias and to reset the free R factor. The coordinates at the end of a refinement step were only accepted if the step produced a significant drop in the free R factor. The missing residues as well as the metal ions were clearly visible in an initial Fo­Fc electron-density map (Figure 2), but were not included in the model until the later stages of the refinement. The resolution was increased in four steps to 1.9 Å with cycles of energy-restrained positional refinement of the coordinates, calculation of individual B factors, as well as visual inspection and correction of the model (using the program O [39]). This procedure gave a free R factor of 28.8% (R = 24.4%). The missing residues were included and water molecules were added manually where stereochemically reasonable, except around the metalbinding sites. At this stage (free R = 18.9%; R = 15.9%), three of the four metal ions showed high density (11.4, 8.6, and 7.3) in an anomalous difference Fourier map calculated with all data (CCP4 [40]). These ions were included in the model as calcium. The fourth metal ion was interpreted as sodium according to the structural characteristics of its ligand sphere. The refinement was completed by adding a few more water molecules resulting in a free R factor of 18.5% and a crystallographic R factor of 15.4% for data between 30 and 1.9 Å.
