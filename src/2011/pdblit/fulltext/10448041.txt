Figure 1. (a) A leishmania pyruvate kinase subunit, and (b) a tetramer. In (a) the C-terminal part of strand Cb1 is drawn as a dotted line to enable the position of the bound sulphate to be seen. Elements of regular secondary structure that are referred to in the text are labelled. In (b) the S and A labels correspond to the residues closest to the molecular 2-fold axes, Ser383 and Ala311, and were used for the measurements of the separations between the smaller and larger interfaces, respectively. The entrances to the catalytic and effector sites are indicated by arrows. The drawings were made with BOBSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), as were all the Figures except 2 and 9.

Figure 3. The ¯exible loop near the effector site. Only in subunit 7 could the polyalanine trace shown be made from residues 485-489. This loop differs drastically from that seen in yeast (shown in magenta) between the marked residues His480 and Asn489, and is close to the sulphate molecule bound in the effector site. Electron density from the ®nal 2Fo À Fc map is shown, contoured at 1s. The arrow indicates the entrance to the effector site.

Figure 4. Stereo ®gure showing some secondary structure elements of the C domain as positioned after superposition of domains A. Shown are the structures of pyruvate kinases from leishmania (cyan), yeast (magenta), E. coli (green) and rabbit muscle (red). This colour scheme is used throughout later Figures. Segments of helix Ca1 are absent from the E. coli and rabbit muscle structures.

Figure 5. Stereo ®gure of the superposition of catalytic site residues from the structures of leishmania (cyan), yeast (magenta) and E. coli (green) pyruvate kinases. The main-chains of the Aa6 helices are traced in the same colours. Also shown, in yellow, are the phosphoglycollate, Mn2 (small sphere) and K (large sphere) seen in the yeast structure.

Figure 6. The allosteric site of leishmania pyruvate kinase. The sulphate molecule and its H-bonds to three or four side-chains, depending on subunit, are shown. Superimposed in magenta are the F1,6BP molecule as it binds to the yeast enzyme and the different ¯exible loop (top of diagram) seen in the yeast structure along with other key residues (see the text for details). The variable loop between beta strands Cb4 and Cb5 is on the right of the diagram. Elements of regular secondary structure referred to in the text are labelled.

The positions of certain key residues are shown (see the text for details). (b) The variety of well-de®ned side-chain conformations of Arg310. The conformations seen in subunits 5, 6, 7 and 8 are shown in shades of blue from dark to light. In cyan are the various H-bond partners in the leishmania enzyme. The corresponding arginine and aspartate residues from E. coli and yeast structures are shown in green and magenta, respectively.

Figure 8. Stereo Figure showing the key role of the side chain of Arg22 in the cleft between domains A (on the left) and C (on the right). Potential H-bonds are indicated by dotted lines. The weaker interaction of Arg22 with Tyr18 may still help to maintain its packing against Pro417. Electron density in the ®nal 2Fo À Fc map is shown at 1.5s.
