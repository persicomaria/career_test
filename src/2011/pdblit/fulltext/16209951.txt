SUMMARY

The Xanthomonas campestris transcription regulator OhrR contains a reactive cysteine residue (C22) that upon oxidation by organic hydroperoxides (OHPs) forms an intersubunit disulphide bond with residue C1270 . Such modification induces the expression of a peroxidase that reduces OHPs to their less toxic alcohols. Here, we describe the structures of reduced and OHP-oxidized OhrR, visualizing the structural mechanism of OHP induction. Reduced OhrR takes a canonical MarR family fold with ° C22 and C1270 separated by 15.5 A. OHP oxidation results in the disruption of the Y360 -C22Y470 interaction network and dissection of helix a5, which then allows the 135 rotation and 8.2 ° A translation of C1270 , formation of the C22C1270 disulphide bond, and a6-a60 helix-swapped reconfiguration of the dimer interface. These changes result in the 28 rigid body rotations of each winged helix-turn-helix motif and DNA dissociation. Similar effector-induced rigid body rotations are expected for most MarR family members.
INTRODUCTION Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated as the byproducts of cellular metabolism and have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and tumor progression (Ceriello, 2006; Cifuentes and Pagano, 2006; Haidara et al., 2006; Halliwell, 2006; Storz, 2005). ROS are also important for normal cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation (Sauer and Wartenberg, 2005; Veal et al., 2007), and transcription regulation (Paget and Buttner, 2003) and

are implicated in bacterial and viral pathogen killing by the immune system (Beaman and Beaman, 1984; Carlyon and Fikrig, 2006; Jones et al., 1991). In prokaryotes, harmful concentrations of ROS are sensed directly by transcriptional regulators such as OxyR, SoxR, PerR, and OhrR, which upon their oxidation increase expression of genes involved in the detoxification of these substances (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Helmann et al., 2003; Hidalgo et al., 1998; Mongkolsuk et al., 2002; Zheng et al., 1998). OhrR, the OHP resistance regulator, is a member of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators and is widely conserved among Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Fuangthong et al., 2001; Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Mongkolsuk and Helmann, 2002; Oh et al., 2007; Panmanee et al., 2002). The MarR family is comprised of transcription factors that regulate genes involved in resistance to numerous cellular toxins such as antibiotics, organic solvents, detergents, or oxidative stress agents (Seoane and Levy, 1995) and, in some pathogens, virulence (Ellison and Miller, 2006; Ingavale et al., 2005). OhrR represses the expression of the ohr gene, which encodes a thiol peroxidase that reduces organic hydroperoxides (OHPs) to their less harmful alcohols. The ohr gene is induced in vivo by oxidation of OhrR by OHPs, but not the smaller and less nonpolar hydrogen peroxide (Fuangthong et al., 2001; Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Panmanee et al., 2002). In accord with this specificity, linoleic acid hydroperoxide, which is a highly toxic lipidic compound that is generated as part of the plant host defense response against the soil bacterium Xanthomonas campestris (Xc), has been shown to cause dissociation of OhrR from the ohr operator and concomitant induction of the ohr gene (Klomsiri et al., 2005). Intriguingly, OHP-oxidized OhrR from Streptomyces coelicolor has been shown to remain weakly bound to cognate DNA and to act as an activator of ohrR expression (Oh et al., 2007). OhrR senses lipophilic and lipid hydroperoxides via oxidation of a family-wide conserved cysteine residue that resides near the N terminus of the protein (Fuangthong

and Helmann, 2002; Hong et al., 2005; Panmanee et al., 2002). Recent sequence analyses have divided ohrR genes into two classes based on the presence or absence of additional cysteine residues that are located in the C terminus of the protein (Panmanee et al., 2006). The multiple cysteine subfamily, which is the major class of OhrR proteins and exemplified by Xc OhrR, contains a second cysteine that forms an intersubunit disulphide bond with the cysteine located on helix a1 of the apposing subunit (Panmanee et al., 2006). For the single cysteine subfamily, the smaller class of OhrR proteins, which includes the Bacillus subtilis (Bs) and Streptomyces coelicolor OhrR, the single cysteine residue (C15) of the Bs OhrR, which is located at the amino terminus of helix a1, is oxidized to form a sulphenic acid derivative (Fuangthong and Helmann, 2002; Hong et al., 2005; Oh et al., 2007; Panmanee et al., 2002). Recent evidence suggests that sulphenic acid formation in Bs OhrR alone is not sufficient for induction and that formation of a cyclic sulphenamide or formation of a mixed disulphide with an intracellular thiol is required for efficient induction (Lee et al., 2007). Genetic and biochemical studies on Xc OhrR have confirmed the presence of a transient sulphenic acid derivative of its corresponding reactive cysteine residue (C22) and the subsequent formation of a disulphide bond with residue C127 of the other OhrR subunit (Panmanee et al., 2006). The recently described crystal structure of Bs OhrR bound to the ohrA operator provided the first description of a MarR family member bound to cognate DNA as well as the structure of a single cysteine containing OhrR in its reduced and uninduced form (Hong et al., 2005). Although these structures provide valuable insight into the DNA-binding mechanism of the OhrR family specifically and the MarR family of transcriptional regulators in general, the structural mechanism of OHP induction of neither a single nor multiple cysteine containing OhrR protein has been elucidated. Indeed, the only other bacterial ROS sensing transcription regulators that have been described structurally are the hydrogen peroxide sensing domain of E. coli OxyR and the MarR family member MgrA from S. aureus (Chen et al., 2006; Choi et al., 2001). OxyR is a member of the LysR family of transcription factors that upon its modification by hydrogen peroxide, but not OHPs, activates the expression of a number of genes in defense against this oxidant (Christman et al., 1989; Storz et al., 1990). Like OhrR, oxidation of the reactive cysteine of OxyR results in the formation of a sulphenic acid but, different from Xc OhrR, this sulphenic acid goes on to form an intrasubunit disulphide bond that results in the reorganization of the quaternary structure of the dimer and upregulation of transcription (Aslund et al., 1999; Choi et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 1998). The complete peroxide activation mechanism of OxyR awaits additional structures, as only structures of the activation domain are known. Intriguingly, the lone cysteine of MgrA is oxidized to sulphenic acid by hydrogen peroxide, OHPs, and superoxide, leading to the upregulation of multiple genes involved in antibiotic resistance (Chen et al., 2006). The

structural mechanism of MgrA ROS induction remains unknown. OhrR, OxyR, and MgrA share little sequence homology, and thus their mechanisms of ROS selectivity and gene regulation are different. In order to elucidate the mechanism of ROS induction of OhrR, we determined the crystal structures of full-length-reduced and OHP-oxidized Xc OhrR. These structures reveal a remarkable structural rearrangement of an ROS sensing protein and, together with the in vivo and in vitro analyses of a series of site-directed mutants, delineate the induction mechanism of the multiple cysteine OhrR subfamily by OHP and provide insight into the induction mechanisms of the single cysteine OhrR proteins and the MarR family. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of Reduced OhrR The crystal structure of reduced Xc OhrR was determined by using a mutant in which the OHP reactive cysteine residue C22 was changed to serine in order to prevent aerobic oxidation. This mutant is locked in the reduced form and binds DNA with wild-type affinity (data not shown). The ° structure was determined to 1.9 A resolution by SAD phasing techniques using selenomethionine substituted protein crystals. Data were collected with an in-house Cr-Ka source utilizing the anomalous signals of selenium and sulfur at this wavelength (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains the physiologically relevant dimer of OhrR. The final model contains residues 8­94 and 103­153 of each subunit, 175 solvent molecules, and 5 formate ions. The final Rwork and Rfree are 23.6% and 27.7%, respectively (Table 1). Residues 95­102 could not be traced, most likely due to the inherent flexibility of the tip of the wing of the winged helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, to which they belong, in the absence of DNA. Reduced OhrR forms a triangular-shaped dimer and as expected has a similar overall fold to all other MarR family members (Alekshun et al., 2001; Bordelon et al., 2006; Hong et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006) (Figure 1A). Each OhrR subunit is composed of six a helices and three b strands with topology: a1 (residues 21­39), a2 (residues 47­58), b1 (residues 62­63), a3 (residues 64­71), a4 (residues 75­ 87), b2 (residues 91­94), b3 (residues 104­107), a5 (residues 109­129), and a6 (residues 133­151) (Figure 1C). Although the longest helix, a5 displays a kink that is centered about residue G119. In addition, there are two single-turn 310 helices N-terminal to helix a1: 1a (residues 13­15) and 1b (residues 17­19). The winged-HTH DNAbinding motif is formed by helices a3 and a4 followed by b strands b2 and b3, which form a small b sheet with b1. Helices 1a, 1b, a1, a5, and a6 from each subunit form an extensive dimerization interface that buries a surface ° area of 5391 A2. Helices a2 and a5 lie perpendicular to each other across one face of each subunit and act to connect the dimerization and OHP sensing domains to the winged-HTH motifs (Figure 1A).

Comparison of the Xc OhrR structure to the structure of DNA-bound Bs OhrR (PDB ID 1Z9C) reveals that the reduced Xc OhrR is preconfigured for DNA binding (Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Indeed, superposition of the Ca atoms of residues 16­94, 104­129, and 137­151 from both subunits of ° both proteins gives an rmsd of 1.16 A. This is unusual, as nearly all other ligand-free MarR structures solved to date, save HucR (Bordelon et al., 2006), show conformational flexibility in the relative orientations of helices a1 and a6 and do not take conformations that would be compatible

with B-DNA binding (Hong et al., 2005). As anticipated, one key structural feature that is conserved between the Xc and Bs OhrR proteins is the hydrogen bond network, which involves residues C22, Y360 , and Y470 (Figure 1A). These interactions are critical to the proper maintenance of the reduced/DNA-bound conformation of Xc and Bs OhrR. Despite their structural similarities, there are a few important local differences between the reduced multiple cysteine Xc and single cysteine Bs OhrR structures. At the N terminus of Xc OhrR there is an extra single-turn 310 helix (1a) not present in the Bs OhrR structure. This additional

310 helix packs against helix a50 (Figure 1A). Also, helix a5 of Xc OhrR is one turn shorter than that of Bs OhrR (six versus seven), whereas helix a6 of Xc OhrR is one turn longer than that of Bs (five versus four). Strikingly, in the reduced Xc OhrR structure, the two reactive cysteine residues that form the OHP-oxidized inter° subunit disulphide bond are 15.5 A apart (Sg-Sg), whereby residue C22 is located at the N terminus of helix a1 and C1270 is located at the C terminus of helix a5 of the apposing subunit (Figure 1A). As observed in Bs OhrR, there are no basic residues near the Sg of Xc OhrR residue ° C22, with the closest lysine or arginine side chain 10 A away. Hence, the heightened reactivity of this atom is mediated primarily by the positive dipole located at the amino end of a1, with likely stabilization of the thiolate provided by hydrogen bonds from the Y360 and Y470 side chains

(Figure 2A). Intriguingly, the side chain of C1270 is pointed away from C22 and toward the solvent, indicating that a large structural change would be necessary for formation of a disulphide bond between these two cysteine residues. A third cysteine residue, C131, is located on a loop ° between helices a5 and a6 and is also within $15 A of residue C22. However, this cysteine is not utilized for induction in vivo (Panmanee et al., 2006). Structural Rearrangement upon OHP Oxidation In order to understand the structural mechanism of OHP induction, i.e., the formation of the intrasubunit disulphide bond and consequential disruption of the DNA-binding conformation of OhrR, we determined the structure of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)-oxidized Xc OhrR (Figures 1B, ° 1C, and 2). The structure was determined to 1.93 A

resolution by molecular replacement using helices a1­a4 of one monomer of reduced Xc OhrR as the search model. The final model contains residues 14­95 and 103­149 from subunit A and residues 18­95 and 102­146 from subunit B and 84 solvent molecules. The final Rwork and Rfree are 21.9% and 25.0%, respectively (Table 1). The structure of CHP-oxidized OhrR is dramatically different from the reduced form, as the conformational changes necessary for formation of the disulphide bond between residues C22 and C1270 have remodelled the tertiary and quaternary structures of the OhrR dimer extensively (Figures 1B, 1C, and 3). The most remarkable changes involve helices a5 and a6 and the dimerization interface (Figures 1 and 3). Upon oxidation, helix a5 is broken into two distinct helices, a5a (residues 109­118) and a5b (residues 122­130), that are connected by a loop that consists of residues G119, A120, and V121. Such disruption of helix a5 allows the C-terminal half of the helix, a5b, upon which C127 resides, to rotate nearly 135 toward residue C22 of the apposing subunit. In addition to ° this rotation, residue C127 moves 8.2 A toward the N terminus of helix a1. Together these movements bring the sulphurs of these residues into proximity and permit formation of the disulphide bond. A further consequence of the large rotation of helix a5b is the striking repositioning of helix a6, which in the oxidized conformer now lies nearly perpendicular to its original position in reduced OhrR (Figures 1 and 3). Moreover, helix a6 has now ``swapped'' positions with helix a60 from the other subunit. Remarkably, such swapping results in a similar dimerization interface, except with opposite polarity (Figures 3A and 3B). The repositioning of helix a6 of

each subunit decreases the buried surface area at the di° merization interface from 5391 A2 in the reduced form to ° 3584 A2 in the oxidized form. Despite the loss of buried surface area upon oxidation, thermal denaturation experiments reveal the thermal stability of oxidized OhrR is even greater than that of reduced OhrR (apparent Tm $57 C reduced OhrR; apparent Tm > 70 C oxidized OhrR; data not shown). Hence, this loss of buried surface area in the oxidized dimer can be offset by the disulphide bond between residues C22 and C1270 as well as the addition of a small buried interface between helix a10 and helices a2, a3, and a6 of the apposing subunit (Figure 1B). Residues involved in the new interaction surface may be important for maintaining oxidized OhrR off cognate DNA, as both residues Y26 and Y72, which are expected to make contacts to DNA based on their conservation with Bs OhrR, are now buried at this interface in the oxidized form. In addition to the striking changes that involve helices a5 and a6, the two 310 helices present in the reduced form are both missing in the oxidized form. Whereas no electron density is visible for helix 1a, helix 1b has unwound, and two of its three residues, L17 and D18, have flipped away from the core of the dimer. In the reduced form, helix 1a stacks against helix a5 residues A118, G119, and A120, which loop out to dissect the helix in the oxidized form, whereas helix 1b packs on top of helix a2 (Figure 1A). Other observed structural changes upon OhrR oxidation include the extension of helix a1 by one turn at both its N and C-termini. The helical extension at the C terminus bends toward and impinges directly upon the DNA-binding domain, which results in the 28 rotation

of each winged-HTH away from its DNA-bound form (Figure 3A). Helices a2 and a5a along with the wingedHTH motif (b2, b3, a3, and a4) rotate essentially as a rigid body, and the consequence of these rotations of the DNAbinding domains is the reorientation of the recognition helices (a4) of each subunit such that they are nearly perpendicular to each other and in a conformation that is clearly unable to bind consecutive major grooves of cognate BDNA (Figures 1 and 3A). Residues W57 and G111 appear to be a key element of this rigid body rotation as the indole nitrogen of helix a2 residue W57 forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of helix a5/a5a residue G111 in both the reduced and oxidized protein (Figures 3C and 3D).

Roles of Y36 and Y47 in OHP Sensing and Induction Site-directed mutagenesis studies on Xc OhrR have revealed several regions of the protein that are important for induction by OHP oxidation both in vivo and in vitro. The effects of mutations on induction in vivo were measured by determination of levels of b-galactosidase expression from a construct that contained the ohrR P1 promoter fused to lacZ (Figure 4). In vitro induction was tested by the ability of OHP to disrupt OhrR-DNA binding as measured by the decrease of fluorescence polarization of 50 fluoresceinated cognate DNA due to protein dissociation from this cognate DNA (Figure S2).

combination with the in vivo and in vitro characterization of a number of site-directed mutants allow us to map many of the key steps of OHP induction. As shown previously, mutation of either residue C22 or C127, but not C131, to alanine completely abolished induction of the ohrR P1 promoter, as did the C22S change, which would result in the ``permanently reduced'' form of OhrR (Panmanee et al., 2006). In both the Xc- and Bsreduced OhrR structures, the side-chain hydroxyl groups of residues Y36 and Y47 (Y29 and Y40 in Bs) are engaged in hydrogen bonds to residue 22 (residue 15 in Bs) (Figures 2A and 5A). Earlier we had proposed that upon oxidation of this cysteine residue, one or both of these hydrogen bonds must be broken and one or both tyrosines must move away in order to accommodate sterically the sulphenic acid derivative (Hong et al., 2005). However, more recent results from studies of Bs OhrR have demonstrated that sulphenic acid formation alone does not appear to be sufficient for disruption of DNA binding in this single cysteine containing OhrR (Lee et al., 2007). For the two cysteine containing Xc OhrR, the sulphenic acid is formed only transiently, and earlier data have shown that the formation of the disulphide bond is necessary for efficient induction in vivo as the OhrR C127S mutant, which forms a C22 sulphenate, is not induced by CHP (Panmanee et al., 2006). The oxidized Xc OhrR crystal structure confirms that disruption of the Y36-C220 -Y47 hydrogen bond network does indeed occur, as neither tyrosine interacts with C22 in the oxidized structure (Figure 5A). The importance of the C22-Y36 interaction in Xc OhrR is underscored by the substitution of Y36 with phenylalanine, alanine, or serine, all of which result in the abrogation of the induction of the ohrR P1 promoter upon OHP oxidation (Figure 4). Clearly the Y36F and Y36A mutants can no longer engage in a hydrogen bond with C22, and the hydroxyl group of the Y36S is too distal to maintain the identical hydrogen

bond, if any at all. Further analysis of the Y36F mutant in vitro has shown that mutation of this residue does not affect the rate of C22 sulphenic acid formation (Figure S2). However, this mutation is insensitive to addition of the OHP cumene hydroperoxide in DNA knockoff experiments, as addition of 10-fold molar excess CHP has no effect on DNA binding (Figure S3). These results suggest that residue Y36 is a ``sensor'' of sulphenic acid formation. Analysis of the reduced and oxidized structures provides a ready explanation for the sensor function of residue Y36. In the reduced form, the side chain of Y36 hydrogen bonds with C22 as well as makes van der Waals contact with residues V121 and V125 on helix a5 (Figure 5B). Even a small shift of Y36 away from C22 would cause a steric clash with these two valine residues. Indeed, superposition of the reduced and oxidized forms reveals that after oxidation the Y36 side chain would be only ° ° 2.8 A from V121 and 2.2 A from V125 in their reduced OhrR locations. In order to avoid steric clash, helix a5 moves and the V121-Y36-V127 contacts are lost. Without this tether, residues G119, A120, and V121 can undergo a helix-to-loop transition, which causes the dissection of helix a5 and either allows or stabilizes the full rotation and translation of the newly formed helix a5b that results in the apposition of residues C1270 and C22 (Figures 1 and 5). Additional energetic contributors to this conformational change are residues G119 and P122, the latter of which is conserved among all OhrR proteins (Panmanee et al., 2006). Both glycine and proline strongly prefer non-ahelical dihedral angles. In reduced, DNA-bound OhrR, residue P122 is constrained by the V121-Y36-V125 interaction to more helical, energetically less favorable 4,c values. Upon loss of these van der Waals contacts by OHP oxidation, residue P122 assumes dihedral angles that are more favorable. Furthermore, dissection of helix a5 allows P122 to start an a helix (a5b) rather than placing this residue in the middle of one, the former being a more

Another favorable energetic consequence of the formation of helix a5b is the ability of V121 and V125 to engage in side chainside chain van der Waals interactions. Thus, the avoidance of steric clash between helix a5 and Y36, the assumption of more favorable 4,c dihedral angles by P122, and the presence of the conformationally flexible residue in the looped-out region are some of the likely energetic factors that ultimately result in the induction of OhrR. By contrast to Y36, when Y47 is changed to either phenylalanine or alanine, there is constitutive expression of bgalactosidase from the ohrR P1 promoter and no change in expression levels upon addition of OHPs (Figure 4). These data indicate that the Y47 mutants no longer act as repressors and imply a deficiency in DNA binding. Indeed, in vitro DNA-binding studies reveal a more than 10-fold reduction in DNA-binding affinity for the Y47F mutant and a 30-fold decrease in affinity for the Y47A mutant (Table S1). CD analysis of the purified mutant proteins demonstrates no large-scale changes in the secondary or tertiary structures of these mutant proteins (as well as the Y36 mutant proteins) when compared to wild-type (data not shown). As the in vivo results show no repression for the Y47 mutants, it is unclear whether these mutants are defective in induction as well as DNA binding. To test for induction, in vitro DNA knockoff experiments were performed. Interestingly, we found that for Y47F in a C127S/C131S mutant background there is an initial decrease in polarization over the first 20 s followed by a slower increase indicative of DNA rebinding and similar to the results seen for the C127S/C131S mutant (Figure S2). However, the initial decrease in polarization is only 30% of the decrease seen in the C127S/C131S

mutant, and the rate of DNA rebinding is 2-fold longer (t1/2 = 120 s), indicating an attenuated response to CHP by this mutant. By contrast, the Y47F mutant in the wildtype background is displaced from DNA, although not to the levels observed for WT, and never regains DNA binding presumably due to formation of the disulphide bond (Figure S2). Conversely, the Y47A mutant was not responsive to the oxidization by CHP at all, as we observed no displacement from the DNA (Figure S3). In sum, these data show that both Y36 and Y47 are critical for the induction response to oxidation by Xc OhrR. Residue Y36 appears to be crucial for sensing the oxidation state of C22 and initiating the signal that induces the conformational changes, which are necessary for disulphide bond formation. Residue Y47 appears to be important for linking the oxidation state of C22 with disruption of DNA binding, as the adjacent conserved DNA-binding residue T46 could move along with Y47, thereby causing a steric clash with the DNA phosphate backbone. Therefore, these residues act in synergy to sense the oxidation state of C22 and transmit the signal to disrupt DNA binding and allow formation of the disulphide bond between C22 and C1270 . In Xanthomonas campestris OhrR, the covalent link is necessary to maintain the oxidized protein off DNA and ensure transcription of the ohr gene. Role of Helices 1a and 1b in the OHP Induction Mechanism The reduced Xc OhrR structure contains two single-turn 310 helices that are not present in the oxidized form (Figure 1). In the reduced form, Helix 1a makes van der Waals contacts with residues 118­122 on helix a50 , some of which lose their helical properties and loop out upon

OHP oxidation of residue C22 and its subsequent disulphide bond formation with residue C1270 . This 310 helix might be specific for the multiple cysteine subfamily of OhrR proteins, as it is not present in any of the Bs OhrR structures. It is possible that helix 1a stabilizes this portion of helix a5 to keep it in a helical conformation in the DNAbound form of Xc OhrR. It is not known whether the looping out of residues 119­121 of helix a5 occurs in the single cysteine subfamily of OhrR upon oxidation. Therefore, the additional contacts made by helix 1a may be unnecessary to effect DNA binding in this smaller subfamily. The second 310 helix, 1b, packs onto helices a10 , a20 , and a30 to form an important hydrophobic pocket. In reduced OhrR, helix 1b residue L17, which is strictly conserved in the OhrR family, packs against the hydrophobic patch on helix a20 , making van der Waals contacts with residue L54 and the aliphatic portion of residue E58 (Figure 6A). The L17 side chain also makes van der Waals contacts with residue F23 on helix a10 and the R70 and L71 side chains on helix a30 (Figure 6A). Upon oxidation, these contacts are lost, as helix 1b unravels and L17 moves away from the core of the protein. As a consequence of the relocation of L17, the side chain of F23 rotates up, along the winged-HTH motif, toward the N terminus of helix a10 of the other subunit (Figures 1B and 6B). The functional importance of this network of interactions with L17 is supported by site-directed mutagenesis that shows substitution to alanine reduces induction both in vivo and in vitro and causes a 10-fold loss in DNA-binding affinity (data not shown). Thus, loss of the larger aliphatic side chain favors the induced conforma-

tion of OhrR. Additionally, substitution of helix a2 residue L54 to alanine results in reduced inducibility both in vivo and in vitro (data not shown). Hence, residue L17 on helix 1b stabilizes the reduced conformation, i.e., DNA-binding conformation of helix a2, helix a1, which contains the sensor cysteine C22, and helix a3 of the winged-HTH DNAbinding motif. Importantly, a helix a2 residue, W57, which is strictly conserved in all OhrR proteins, is an important link between the helix 1b ``latch,'' the DNA-binding domain, and helix a5. Residue R115, which is N-terminal to the point of dissection of helix a5, forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone oxygen of W57 in the reduced form (Figure 3C). Upon oxidation, this interaction is broken and a new interaction between the side chains of R115 (helix a5a) and E123 (helix a5b) is formed, thereby stabilizing the oxidized conformation (Figure 3D). Furthermore, the indole amine of W57 hydrogen bonds to the backbone oxygen of G111 in helix a5, another strictly conserved OhrR residue, and this interaction is maintained in both the reduced and oxidized forms, indicating its possible role in maintaining the DNA-binding domain as a rigid body. In accord, helix 1b as well as residues W57 and G111 is present in the Bs OhrR-DNA complex structure (Hong et al., 2005), and they make identical interactions to those of reduced Xc OhrR, thus indicating that these are conserved elements of all reduced OhrR proteins. Specificity for OHPs OhrR is oxidized specifically by OHPs and does not respond to hydrogen peroxide in vivo (Fuangthong et al., 2001). This contrasts with OxyR, which is induced

specifically by hydrogen peroxide, but not organic peroxides (Zheng et al., 1998). The structure of reduced OhrR reveals a small hydrophobic cleft on the surface of the protein that leads directly to the reactive cysteine residue C22 ° (Figure 7). This shallow hydrophobic pocket, which is $8 A ° in depth, is created by residues from helix across and 6 A a5, helix a1, and the N terminus of helix a10 from the apposing subunit and forms a direct path to the reactive cysteine. Residues lining this cleft include M32 and V125, which are conserved as hydrophobic residues in all OhrR sequences. The base of the cleft is formed by the strictly conserved helix a5 residue P122. Modeling of CHP into this pocket shows that this aromatic OHP readily fits and can make favorable van der Waals contacts and thereby suggests a functional importance of this accessible nonpolar site in binding OHPs and discriminating against the more polar hydrogen peroxide. This pocket differs from that of OxyR, which is also solvent exposed but more hydrophilic and therefore would expect to display the opposite ROS preference (Choi et al., 2001). The OHP-binding pocket described here differs from the OHP ``landing patch'' that was posited earlier (Hong et al., 2005). The landing patch is comprised of a series of hydrophobic residues on helix a2 that are conserved throughout the OhrR family, but not the MarR superfamily. However, a dual role for helix a2 can now be envisioned. One is to hold onto the helix 1b latch in the reduced form, and the second is as an accessory binding site for the hydrophobic portion of long-chain, lipophilic hydroperoxides such as linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Intriguingly, MgrA maintains sequences that are identical or homologous to those of the OhrR helix a2 and the shallow pocket. However, the architecture surrounding its ROS-

sensing cysteine differs substantially, including the replacement of one of the OhrR-conserved Tyr-Cys interactions by a Ser-Cys hydrogen bond (Chen et al., 2006). Such local changes are likely responsible for the physiologically relevant reactivity of MgrA with OHPs, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide radicals. Perspectives and Conclusions The crystal structures of reduced and oxidized Xc OhrR provide views of the DNA-binding and OHP oxidationinduced conformations of OhrR. These structures, when combined with site-directed mutagenesis data, have allowed the elucidation of the structural mechanism for OHP induction and disruption of DNA binding (Movies S1 and S2). The initiating step is the binding of OHP to OhrR likely utilizing the hydrophobic cleft, which is created primarily by the junction of helices a1 and a5 and is fully accessible when OhrR is bound to cognate DNA. Once bound, OHP oxidizes residue C22 to its sulphenic acid form. Sulphenic acid formation causes a steric clash, with residue Y36 disrupting its hydrogen bond to C22, and begins the cascade of structural rearrangements. Y47 is also repositioned upon oxidation and likely transmits the signal to the DNA-binding domain via residue T46, a conserved residue, which interacts with the DNA phosphate backbone in the Bs OhrR-DNA complex. These movements also dislodge ``latch'' residue L17 from a2 and a5, which allows a large rotation of each DNA-binding domain. Concomitant with these movements is the dissection of helix a5, which is driven by the steric clash between Y36 and V121 and V125 and followed by the 135 rotation of helix ° a5b and hence residue C1270 and the 8.2 A translation of this residue toward C22. The proximity of the C22

Structures of Oxidized and Reduced Xc OhrR

sulphenate and C1270 sulphydryl would allow rapid formation of a disulphide bond. This intersubunit link locks in a protein conformation that ensures high-affinity DNA binding cannot take place. Another consequence of the rotation of helix a5b is the rotation of helix a6, which results in the swapping of the a6 helices within the dimer. Large structural changes are clearly necessary for the formation of the intersubunit disulphide bond, which is crucial to maintaining OhrR off ohr operator DNA in an oxidizing cellular environment. Whether OHP oxidation of OhrR occurs on or off DNA is unknown, but given the high affinity of OhrR for cognate DNA ($7 nM), the energetic cost of fully altering the conformation of the protein is likely lower when it is dissociated from DNA than bound to DNA. Nonetheless, the initial steps of OHP oxidation, including OHP binding and sulphenic acid formation, could take place when OhrR is bound to DNA. Such initial chemical events would likely disrupt or at the least weaken OhrR-DNA binding and are supported by in vitro DNA ``knockoff'' experiments (Figure S2). DNA dissociation would facilitate all subsequent conformational rearrangements, in particular those involving helices a5 and a6 that permit disulphide bond formation, which locks in the conformation of the fully oxidized protein. An analogous stepwise induction mechanism has been suggested for OxyR upon its modification by hydrogen peroxide (Lee et al., 2004). Of course, OHP-oxidation might occur only when OhrR is dissociated from DNA. Further studies are required to tease apart the energetics of these structural transitions as well as any discrete kinetic steps involved in the oxidation of Xc OhrR. Clearly, there will be mechanistic differences between single and multiple cysteine OhrR proteins. Whether the C22 sulphenic acid form of Xc OhrR can attack the amide nitrogen of the neighboring phenylalanine to form an inducing cyclic sulphenamide as seen in Bs OhrR (Lee et al., 2007) is unknown but considered unlikely given the rapid formation of the intersubunit disulphide bond. Recent studies by Helmann and coworkers imply that transmission of the ``oxidation signal'' is different between the single and multiple cysteine subfamilies (Soonsanga et al., 2007). Furthermore, the dissection of a5 is likely specific to the multiple cysteine OhrR family. Regardless, disulphide bond formation between the two subunits of OhrR is key to keeping OhrR off DNA until the Ohr thiol peroxidase can rid the cell of OHPs. The structure of an OHPoxidized single cysteine OhrR will be necessary to discern those parts of the induction mechanism that are general to the entire OhrR family and those specific to the multiple cysteine OhrR family. We anticipate that the global regulator MgrA of Staphylococcus aureus, which is a member of the MarR family and induced by hydrogen peroxide and OHPs (Chen et al., 2006), will follow a parallel induction pathway. Finally, it is tempting to speculate that all MarR family members undergo similar rigid body rotations of their winged-HTH motifs upon binding their specific inducers as an effective mechanism to derepress or activate the

transcription of appropriate stress-response genes. Indeed, superposition of the published structures of 12 MarR family members reveals that the tertiary structure of the winged-HTH domains are quite similar, whereby the rmsds of equivalent residues from 10 of 12 structures (overlaid onto residues 47­94 and 104­109 of reduced Xc ° OhrR) were 1.3 A2 or less. Thus, the structural rigidity of this DNA-binding element supports the idea that, although the specifics of each induction pathway will be different, the large rigid body rotation of the winged-HTH motifs that is seen for Xc OhrR is the general mechanism for disruption of DNA binding by most if not all the MarR family.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Purification of OhrR The wild-type or mutant ohrR coding region of the Xc ohrR gene was cloned in pET11a for overexpression in E. coli BL21(DE3). E. coli BL21(DE3) containing pET11a-OhrR was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) media supplemented with 100 mg/mL ampicillin and 0.4% glucose to an OD600 of 0.6 at which point protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 2 hr at 37 C. Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 25 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche), and DNase I. The cells were lysed with a microfluidizer M-110L (Microfluidics), and the lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a HiTrap Heparin column (Amersham-Pharmacia) and eluted with a linear gradient from 25 mM to 0.7 M NaCl using an ° AKTA purification system (Amersham-Pharmacia). Fractions containing the OhrR protein, as assessed by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against the lysis buffer. The partially purified protein was applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham-Pharmacia) and eluted with lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaCl. The purified protein was concentrated to 30 mg/mL in the same buffer and used in crystallization trials or fluorescence polarization experiments. Site-Directed Mutagenesis of ohrR A mutagenic primer and its complementary primer were designed for each desired mutation. Each of these primers was used in separate PCR reactions containing pBBRohrR as the DNA template and M13Forward or M13-Reverse primer (Panmanee et al., 2002). The second amplification reaction contained these two PCR products as well as the M13-Forward and M13-Reverse primers. The EcoRI-SacI digestion of the second PCR products was cloned into pBBR1 MCS-5 (Kovach et al., 1994) at the same sites to generate plasmids identical to pBBRohrR except for the mutations at the desired bases. All constructs were verified by sequencing prior to transfer into the Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli ohrR mutant XP P1lacZ (Panmanee et al., 2002). b-Galactosidase Assay Xanthomonas strains were grown aerobically overnight in SB medium (Silva-Baddenhagen medium, 0.5% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sucrose, and 0.1% glutamic acid [pH 7.0]) containing appropriate antibiotics at 28 C followed by subculture in fresh SB medium (Mongkolsuk et al., 1997). Exponential phase cells were then exposed to various concentrations of two oxidants: cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) at 50 mM, 100 mM, and 200 mM and tert-butyl hydroperoxide at 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, and 500 mM. After 15 min, cells were collected and sonicated. Cell lysates were used for the b-galactosidase assay as described previously (Mongkolsuk and Helmann, 2002). Samples without oxidant addition were used as a control. All assays were performed at least three times, and the values were averaged.

Structures of Oxidized and Reduced Xc OhrR

Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement of Reduced OhrR In order to facilitate crystallization of the reduced form of OhrR, we used a mutant in which residue C22 was changed to serine to prevent aerobic oxidation over time. Crystals were grown at 22 C by using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method from reservoir solutions containing 4.0 M sodium formate. Crystals appeared within 2 days, grew to full dimensions within 1 week, and took the space group P212121 (Table 1). Selenomethionine-substituted protein was crystallized similarly. The crystallization solution served as a suitable cryoprotectant, and crystals were flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at À180 C. X-ray data were collected at home on a Rigaku FR-E DW Super Bright generator with Cu-Ka X-rays and an R-AXIS HTC image plate detector. SAD data were collected with the same Rigaku X-ray generator using Cr-Ka X-rays. 720 of intensity data were collected, processed, and scaled with d*Trek (Pflugrath, 1999) as implemented in the Crystal Clear software package from MSC-Rigaku (The Woodlands, TX). The structure of the selenomethionine-substituted reduced OhrR was determined by SAD phasing with data collected at the Cr-Ka ab° sorption edge (2.29 A). Three selenium sites and four cysteine sulfur sites were located and refined, and phasing was carried out with ° SOLVE (Terwilliger, 2003) using data to 2.5 A resolution. The overall figure of merit after phasing with SOLVE was 0.37, and phases were improved with solvent flattening using RESOLVE (Terwilliger, 2003). The resulting electron density map was sufficient to trace the two subunits of the OhrR dimer. An initial model was determined with iterative rounds of model building in O (Jones et al., 1991) and refinement ¨ with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) and contained residues 8­94 and 103­153 of each monomer with an Rf = 32.3% and Rw = 28.0%. This ° structure was refined against the native data to 1.90 A resolution. The final model contains residues 8­94 and 103­153 of each subunit, 175 water molecules, and 5 formates and has an Rf = 27.7% and Rw = 23.6%. The stereochemistry of the final model was assessed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993), which revealed 96.7% of all f,c angles in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and no residues in the disallowed regions.

Crystallization, Structure Determination, and Refinement of Oxidized OhrR In order to facilitate the crystallization of the physiologically relevant oxidized OhrR, we used a mutant in which residue C131 was changed to serine, thereby ensuring disulphide homogeneity of the oxidized sample. Protein was oxidized in the presence of 6 mM cumene hydroperoxide for $2 hr and purified by gel filtration in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl. Crystals were obtained by using the hanging drop-vapor diffusion method and reservoir solutions containing 30% PEG 4000, 300 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5). Crystals grew overnight, reached final dimensions within 1 week, and took the space group C2221 (Table 1). The structure of oxidized OhrR was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (McCoy et al., 2005) as implemented in the CCP4 software suite (CCP4, 1994) and residues 19­107 of one monomer of the reduced OhrR as the search model. A complete model was built after iterative rounds of model building and phase improvement using density modification and phase combination as implemented ¨ in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The final model contains residues 14­ 95 and 103­149 of subunit A, residues 18­95 and 102­146 of subunit B, and 84 water molecules and was refined to an Rf = 25.0% and Rw = 21.9%. The stereochemistry of the final model was assessed by PROCHECK, which revealed 96.1% of all f,c angles in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and no residues in the disallowed regions.
