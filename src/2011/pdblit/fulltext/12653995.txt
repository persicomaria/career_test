The crystal structures of thermophilic xylanases from Chaetomium thermophilum and Nonomuraea flexuosa were ∞ determined at 1.75 and 2.1 A resolution, respectively. Both enzymes have the overall fold typical to family 11 xylanases with two highly twisted b-sheets forming a large cleft. The comparison of 12 crystal structures of family 11 xylanases from both mesophilic and thermophilic organisms showed that the structures of different xylanases are very similar. The sequence identity differences correlated well with the structural differences. Several minor modifications appeared to be responsible for the increased thermal stability of family 11 xylanases: (a) higher Thr : Ser ratio (b) increased number of

charged residues, especially Arg, resulting in enhanced polar interactions, and (c) improved stabilization of secondary structures involved the higher number of residues in the b-strands and stabilization of the a-helix region. Some members of family 11 xylanases have a unique strategy to improve their stability, such as a higher number of ion pairs or aromatic residues on protein surface, a more compact structure, a tighter packing, and insertions at some regions resulting in enhanced interactions. Keywords: xylanase; glycoside hydrolases; family 11; thermostability.

Xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8) are glycoside hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis of internal b-1,4 bonds of xylan, the major hemicellulose component of the plant cell wall. The enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan has potential economical and environment-friendly applications. Xylanases can be used in bleaching of pulp to reduce the use of toxic chlorinecontaining chemicals [1] or to improve the quality of animal feed [2]. In addition, there are applications in the food and beverage industry [3]. Therefore, attention is focused on discovery of new xylanases or improvement of existing ones in order to meet the requirements of industry such as stability and activity at high temperature and extreme pH. The xylanases that have been structurally characterized to date can be classified into the glycoside hydrolase families 10 and 11, corresponding to former families F and G,

respectively [4]. Family 10 enzymes have an (a/b)8 barrel fold with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa. Family 11 xylanases are somewhat smaller, approximately 20 kDa, and their fold contains an a-helix and two b-sheets packed against each other, forming a so-called b-sandwich. Due to the industrial applications of xylanase, both xylanase families are well studied. In this paper, we focus on xylanases in family 11. To date, the crystal structures of family 11 xylanases are available from several organisms: Trichoderma harzianum [5], Bacillus circulans [5≠7], Trichoderma reesei [8,9], Aspergillus niger [10], Thermomyces lanuginosus [11], Aspergillus kawachii [12], Bacillus agaradhaerens [13], Paecilomyces varioti [14], and Dictyoglomus thermophilum [15]. Three of these, T. lanuginosus, P. varioti, and D. thermophilum are from thermophilic organisms. In addition, a low-resolution structure has been reported for thermostable Bacillus D3 [16] but no PDB coordinates are available. Very recently, the structures of two new xylanases from Streptomyces sp. S38 [17] and Bacillus subtilis B230 [18] have also been solved. A disulphide bridge has been suggested to be one reason for the enhanced thermal stability of T. lanuginosus and P. varioti xylanases [11,14]. A greater proportion of polar surface and a slightly extended C-terminus together with an extension of b-strand A5 are thought to increase the stability of D. thermophilum xylanase [15,19]. Despite all these studies, the structural basis for the thermostability of family 11 xylanases is not well understood. We report here the three-dimensional structures of two new members of family 11 xylanases. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain from Chaetomium thermophilum ∞ xylanase Xyn11A (CTX) has been determined at 1.75 A resolution and the catalytic domain from Nonomuraea ∞ flexuosa xylanase Xyn11A (NFX) at 2.1 A resolution.

and NFX act optimally at 65≠80 ∞C; NFX, in particular, is a remarkably stable enzyme, having a half-life of 273 min at 80 ∞C and even 28 min at 100 ∞C. In addition, NFX is active at pH 8. The crystal structures of CTX and NFX allowed us to make detailed comparison of 12 xylanases, five from thermophilic organisms. This gives a more reliable comparison of the enzyme structures in relation to their thermostability than earlier studies and helps us to understand the molecular basis of the thermostability of these industrially relevant enzymes.

Materials and methods
Protein purification The catalytic domains of C. thermophilum and N. flexuosa expressed from Trichoderma reesei were purified from samples kindly provided by A. Mantyla (ROAL, Rajamaki, ® ® ® Finland). GenBank accession codes are AJ508931 and AJ508952 for C. thermophilum xylanase and N. flexuosa xylanase, respectively. C. thermophilum xylanase was expressed in T. reesei as a full-length enzyme containing 235 amino acids and N. flexuosa as a construct coding mainly the catalytic domain (220 amino acids). However, it is likely that an extracellular protease has cleaved off the C-terminal tail of C. thermophilum xylanase (shortening was seen in SDS/PAGE) and possibly also several C-terminal residues outside the catalytic core of N. flexuosa xylanase. As determined by SDS/PAGE, the C. thermophilum xylanase was present as a  26 kDa protein and the N. flexuosa xylanase as  28 kDa. Both xylanases were purified by cation exchange chromatography (CM Sepharose Fast Flow; Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (Phenyl Sepharose Fast Flow, Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech). The procedure was essentially the same as that described for T. reesei xylanase [20]. The C. thermophilum xylanase was further purified on a Q Sepharose High Performance column (Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 4). A linear gradient of 0≠0.25 M NaCl in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 4) was used to elute the enzyme. Enzyme assay The half-life of each xylanase was determined at different temperatures in 50 mM citrate/phosphate buffer, 0.01 mg∆mL)1 bovine serum albumin, pH 6.0. After incubations at each temperature, the residual activity of xylanase was determined by measuring the amount of reducing sugars liberated from 1% birchwood xylan [21]. The half-lives were determined for enzymes produced in T. reesei. Crystallization and data collection The catalytic domains of Chaetomium xylanase (CTX) and Nonomuraea xylanase (NFX) were crystallized by a hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at room temperature. CTX crystals were obtained in 8 mL droplets containing approximately 5 mg∆mL)1 protein (A280 º 1 corresponds to the concentration 0.37 mg∆mL)1 of protein) 0.7 M ammo-

nium sulfate and 0.05 M Hepes at pH 7.2. Crystals of NFX were grown in 8 mL droplets containing 7 mg∆mL)1 protein, 0.4 M ammonium sulfate and 0.05 M sodium acetate at pH 6.0. In both cases, the droplets were equilibrated against reservoir solution with a twofold higher concentration of ammonium sulfate and buffer. When sodium acetate buffer was used instead of Hepes, CTX also crystallized at pH 6≠7, but these crystals diffracted only up ∞ to 3≠4 A. Similarly with Hepes buffer, NFX crystallized at pH 7≠8, but the crystals were not suitable for X-ray analysis. High quality crystals of CTX (dimensions 0.5 ∑ 0.2 ∑ 0.2 mm) and NFX (0.3 ∑ 0.2 ∑ 0.2 mm) appeared in the drop after a few days and reached their final size in two weeks. Data were collected on a Rigaku RU-200HB rotating anode X-ray generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA equipped with an Osmic Confocal Optics and an RAXISIIC imaging plate detector. Initially, the data sets of CTX and NFX crystals were collected at room temperature at ∞ resolutions of 2.4 and 2.3 A, respectively. Later, higher resolution data sets were collected at 120 K at resolutions of ∞ ∞ 1.75 A and 2.1 A, respectively. Crystals from both xylanases were soaked in cryoprotectant solution containing 30% glycerol. The diffraction images were processed with DENZO software and the data were scaled with SCALEPACK software [22]. The space groups were defined using XPREP program (SHELX software package). CTX crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell parameters ∞ ∞ ∞ a º 108.24 A, b º 57.15 A, and c º 65.68 A. The asymmetric unit contained two molecules. NFX crystals were ∞ hexagonal with unit cell parameters a,b º 37.03 A, and ∞ c º 191.81 A and they belonged to the space group P61. The asymmetric unit of NFX crystals contained only one molecule. The data collection statistics are presented in Table 1. Structure solution and refinement Both structures were determined using the molecular replacement method with the AMoRe program [23]. The search model was Trichoderma reesei xylanase II (TRX II, PDB code 1ENX). Sequence identities of CTX and NFX (digestion site determined with mass spectrometer) with TRX II are 63% and 51%, respectively. The molecular replacement solutions were initially calculated from the room temperature data sets and the models were further improved with the high-resolution data sets. Iterative cycles of refinement and manual fitting were carried out using programs CNS [24] and O [25]. To monitor the progress of the refinement, a total of 10% of the reflections were set aside for the R-free calculations. Refinements were carried out using the maximum-likelihood method with bulksolvent corrections. The water molecules of the CTX model were positioned automatically with the wARP [26] but were also checked and finalized with the O. The water molecules of NFX were positioned with CNS and O. Refinement statistics of the final models are presented in Table 1. The CTX model contained four sulfates and two of them at special positions. As the refinement programs are not able to refine covalent bonds at special positions, only the sulfur atoms of these two sulfates were modeled. However, the electron density map showed clearly the

shape of the tetrahedral corresponding to the sulfate ion. In the final model, two conformations of residues A10, B10 and A123 of CTX were refined. There were also signs of other conformations of surface residues A32, A37, A38, A62, A70, A83, A110, B32, B37, B57, and B70 of CTX. The final model was evaluated with PROCHECK software [27]. Comparison of family 11 xylanases The coordinates of 10 different family 11 xylanases were available in PDB. First, the Ca atoms of all xylanase models were roughly superimposed with the O program. To create the final multiple alignment, STAMP software [28] was applied. The secondary structures were assigned with the DSSP software [29]. The solvent accessible surface areas of xylanases were ∞ calculated with the NACCESS software [30] using a 1.4 A ∞ probe. Van der Waals volumes were calculated using 1.4 A probes and without probes with the VOIDOO program [31]. Numbers of hydrogen bonds were calculated for all xylanases using HBPLUS routine [32] with the default parameters for distances and angles. A salt bridge was assigned, when the distance between the two atoms of ∞ opposite charge was less than 4 A [33]. In all calculations, water molecules and hetero-atoms were excluded from the coordinate files and the chains were split.

Mass spectrometry Mass spectra of CTX and NFX were measured by a Bruker BioAPEX II 47e FTICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) using positive mode electrospray ionization (ESI). This instrument is equipped with a passively shielded 4.7-T superconducting magnet, cylindrical infinity ICR cell and external electrospray ion source (Analytica of Branford). Aliquots of CTX and NFX were diluted with a methanol/water (1 : 1, v/v) solvent, followed by glacial acetic acid (1%) to obtain denaturing solution conditions for efficient protonation in ESI. The final concentration for both proteins was approximately 0.5 mg∆mL)1. Samples were infused into the ESI-source by a syringe infusion pump (Cole-Parmer) at a rate of 50 lL∆h)1. Ionization voltage was )3.7 kV and ions were accumulated for 2 s in an RF-only hexapole ion guide before they were transferred into the ICR cell for excitation and detection. The drying gas in a spraying process was pure nitrogen gas. All data were acquired and processed with a Bruker XMASS 5.0.1. software. The mass spectra were calibrated against an acetonitrile-based ES Tuning Mix (Hewlett Packard) by peptide peaks in the m/z range of 200≠3000. Molecular masses of observed proteins were calculated as average values over the charge state distributions using the ESIMASS macro program. Relative abundances of glycosylated and nonglycosylated protein species were calculated

using the absolute intensities of the peaks appearing in the ESI-spectra.

Results and discussion
Overall structure of C. thermophilum xylanase The overall structure of xylanase from C. thermophilum (CTX) was dominated by one a-helix and two strongly twisted b-sheets, which were packed against each other. This is the protein fold of family 11 xylanases. According to Torronen et al. [8], the shape of the molecule resembles a ® ® right hand: two b-sheets and the a-helix form fingers and a palm, a long loop between the B7 and B8 strands forms a thumb, and a loop between the B6 and B9 strands forms a cord (Fig. 1A). The final model of CTX contained residues 1≠191 for both molecules in the asymmetric unit (labeled A and B). The first residue, glutamine, was deaminated and cyclized to pyrrolidone carboxylic acid. When the ESI mass spectrum of CTX was measured, the unique molecular masses, 21 479 Da and 21 682 Da, were obtained. Assuming that CTX contains 196 residues, the calculated molecular mass would be 21 478 Da, which agrees well with the lower mass obtained. The difference between the two obtained masses was 203 Da corresponding to one N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc). There is one potential N-glycosylation site (Asn62) in the sequence of CTX, but there was no clear sign of glycosylation in the electron density map. It is possible that only the protein molecules without GlcNAcs had been crystallized or that the GlcNAc is disordered. According to the mass spectrum, approximately 20% of the material did not contain GlcNAc or alternatively, the GlcNAc had been lost. In the crystal structure, a glycerol molecule was located in the active site of molecule A, but was not observed in molecule B. The cryoprotectant soaking solution was most likely the source of glycerol, which was packed against Trp19 by stacking interactions and was hydrogen-bonded

to carboxyl group of Pro127. In addition, Arg123 had two conformations in molecule A and in one of the conformations the guadinine group of the Arg was located towards the hydroxyl group of the glycerol. The rms deviation ∞ between the A and B molecules of CTX was 0.8 A. The crystal structure showed four sulfate ions and a calcium ion in the asymmetric unit. The calcium ion was located between molecules A and B exactly on the noncrystallographic axis. The calcium ion interacted with side chains Oc of Thr10 from molecule A and B, both of which clearly had two conformations in the electron density map. Two of the sulfate ions were located exactly on the crystallographic axes. In addition to these two sulfate ions, which are attached to Arg residues A27 and B27, there are two other sulfates, which are attached to Arg residues A68 and B68. Due to the crystal packing, the enzyme resembles a tetrameric assembly (Fig. 1B). Four sulfate ions link molecule A to symmetry molecule D and correspondingly molecule B to symmetry molecule C. However, according to the dynamic light scattering measurements, the protein was a monomer. Therefore, the sulfate ions from the crystallization solution might have been involved in this ‘tetramerization’ process. It is possible that tetramers were assembled first and their stacking then led to crystal formation in the high salt concentration. Overall structure of N. flexuosa xylanase The protein fold of the xylanase from N. flexuosa (NFX) was the same as that of CTX and other family 11 xylanases (Fig. 2A). The crystal structure of NFX contained 197 residues with a sequence GNPGNP at the C-terminus. The sequence GNPGNP seems to be a part of the C-terminal tail of the full-length NFX with total 301 residues. The amino acids of the C-terminal tail were sticking out from the model, but if the C-terminus of NFX is excluded, the enzyme is slightly more compact than CTX, probably due to short deletions. The electron density map showed that there was Ala at position 73 instead of Gly, which had been

determined earlier by sequencing. This might be a sequencing error or mutation in the T. reesei strain. The crystal structure of NFX revealed that the enzyme has a single N-glycosylation site at Asn7, where two N-acetyl-glucosamines and two mannoses were attached (Fig. 2B). Carbohydrates are orientated in the same way as the backbone of b-strand B1 and therefore they are almost like an extension of the b-strand. N-glycans are known to have a stabilizing effect and they may prevent the aggregation of unfolded protein molecules [34]. However, NFX contains N-glycans only when the enzyme is expressed in T. reesei. In the ESI mass spectrum, we were able to see six peaks in every charge state, corresponding to heterogeneously glycosylated molecules. From the peaks of the most abundant charge state distribution corresponding to a mass of 23491 Da, we concluded that most of the material contained 206 residues, two GlcNAcs and three mannoses. The difference of 22 Da between the calculated (22577 Da) and the measured (22599 Da) was probably due to the formation of sodium adduct. ∞ On the protein surface, an acetate ion was located 3.2 A ∞ away from Ser187 Oc and 2.8 A from Ser36 Oc. The glycerol molecule was again found in the active site. It was slightly differently located in the active site of NFX than it was in the active site of CTX. The glycerol was packed against Trp20 (corresponding to Trp19 in CTX), but it was slightly deeper in the active site. In NFX, Tyr170 and Tyr78 interacted with hydroxyl groups of glycerol. When this complex structure is compared with the complex structure of T. reesei xylanase with epoxyalkyl xylosides [35], the glycerol appears to mimic the binding of the xylose ring in the active site. The binding of glycerol to a single site may suggest that this site is the strongest binding subsite for the xylose subunits of xylan. Structural comparison of family 11 xylanases The C. thermophilum (CTX) and N. flexuosa (NFX) xylanases are much more thermostable than the mesophilic T. reesei xylanase II (TRX II). While TRX II was rapidly

inactivated at 55≠60 ∞C, CTX was stable up to 60≠65 ∞C and NFX was stable at 80 ∞C and it had some stability even at 90≠100 ∞C (Table 2). However, the reasons for the significantly higher thermostability of NFX and CTX are not readily evident at the structural level, as they both resemble TRX II xylanase very closely. Because a number of solved three-dimensional structures of family 11 xylanases are now available for both mesophiles and thermophiles, we made a detailed comparison of the structures of these enzymes. Twelve structures used in the comparison are summarized in Table 3 and the sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 3. According to the sequence homology of family 11 xylanases, which have a solved crystal structure, the enzymes can be divided into four groups (Fig. 4). The first group is formed from acidophilic xylanases ANX, AKX, and TRX I. The second group contains alkalophilic BAX and highly thermophilic DTX (sequence identity 58%). The third group is formed from thermophilic NFX and mesophilic BCX (sequence identity 59%). The fourth group contains mesophilic THX and TRX II together with thermophilic PVX, TLX, and CTX. BAX, DTX, BCX, and NFX are all from bacterial sources, whereas the others are fungal enzymes.

When three-dimensional structures of family 11 xylanases are superimposed, their rmsd (root-mean-square deviation) values correlate well with the sequence similarities. The sequence identities of family 11 xylanases, including all molecules in the asymmetric unit, are shown in the function of rmsd values in Fig. 5. The sequence identity range for different family 11 xylanases was 31≠97% and rmsd range ∞ was 0.2≠1.4 A. The natural structural differences can be seen in the upper part of the figure (sequence identity ∞ 100%). The high rmsd value 0.8 A, which exists between molecules A and B of CTX, is partly due to movements induced by glycerol binding. Therefore, we note that some of the structural differences among family 11 xylanases are caused by ligand binding. Both NFX and molecule A of CTX contain the glycerol while BAX contains the b-D-xylopyranoside in the active site. For the structural comparisons, other family 11 xylanases were chosen without ligands. The superimposition of three-dimensional structures confirmed the subgroups of xylanases based on sequence similarities. For example, the lowest rmsd value of thermo∞ philic NFX is with mesophilic BCX (0.78 A), both belong∞ ) with molecule ing to group 3. NFX had a low rmsd (0.82 A A of thermophilic CTX, showing that groups 3 and 4 are closely related. Molecule A of CTX has the lowest rmsd ∞ with mesophilic THX (0.71 A) and molecule B of CTX with ∞ mesophilic TRX II (0.75 A), all belonging to group 4. In group 1, alkalophilic BAX has the lowest rmsd with ∞ thermophilic DTX (0.79 A between molecule A of BAX and molecule A of DTX). As the crystal structures of mesophilic and thermophilic xylanases are very similar, it is likely that an array of minor modifications forms the structural basis for enhanced stability in thermophilic xylanases. Therefore, several factors, which are thought to be responsible for thermostability, were compared between thermophilic and mesophilic family 11 xylanases. The alkalophilic BAX was not included in the same group as other mesophilic xylanases, because its functional properties seem to be different. Bacillus agaradhaerens grows optimally at unusually high pH (over 10). On the other hand, acidophilic TRX I, AKX and ANX would be considered as a separate group of acidic xylanases, but in

our comparisons they were included in the mesophiles as a large number of mesophilic xylanases are slightly acidic in their activity profiles. The C-terminal tail (GNPGNP) of NFX was excluded. Sequence properties Frequencies of all 20 amino acids were computed for thermophilic and mesophilic family 11 xylanases (Table 4). It is obvious that the comparison of amino acid contents suffered from the low number of sequences and thus, statistical methods were not used to analyze the data. However, this comparison may still reveal some important trends and some of the trends in the amino acid frequencies could be related to the thermostability of xylanases. There was found an increased occurrence of arginines in the thermophilic xylanases. Large-scale sequence comparisons have shown that thermophilic proteins contain more arginines on the protein surface than mesophilic proteins [36≠38]. The effect of the large-scale increase in the number of arginines was tested experimentally in T. reesei xylanase II [39]. These results showed that the introduction of five arginines into the Ser/Thr surface increased considerably the thermotolerance in the presence of the substrate. Another trend is that in thermophilic xylanases the frequency of Ser decreases and correspondingly the frequency of Thr increases (Table 4). Ser fi Thr mutation was one of the stabilizing mutations found by the early study of Argos et al. [40]. For thermophilic proteins, the decrease in the frequency of Ser but not the increase of Thr was observed by Kumar et al. [38]. These authors found that in thermophilic proteins, Arg and Tyr are more frequent, while Cys and Ser are less frequent. One possible explanation for this finding in xylanases is that the increase in the Thr : Ser ratio in b-strands (Table 5) improves the b-forming propensities. Over half of the residues in the family 11 xylanases are located in the b-strands. In thermophilic xylanases, the frequency of asparagines is slightly lower (Tables 4 and 5). Asn has a low b-forming propensity, and thus might be avoided in the b-strands of thermophilic xylanases. The highly thermostable xylanase DTX showed a decreased frequency of Gly (Table 4)

compared to both mesophilic and other thermophilic xylanases. Avoidance of Gly probably increases the rigidity of the loop regions. However, there is no general trend toward decreased frequency of Gly among thermophilic family 11 xylanases. Pro does not seem to play any general role in the thermostabilization of these enzymes. Thermophilic xylanases have substantially less Val (Tables 4 and 5). Although Val has a good b-forming propensity, still its frequency is lower in the b-strands of the thermophilic xylanases (Table 5), indicating the increase in the b-forming propensity is not of primary importance in xylanases if some other property is more critical for thermostability. In addition, thermophilic xylanases contain more amino acid residues in the solved crystal structures than mesophilic xylanases (Table 4). The higher frequency of charged residues is involved in increasing the number of polar interactions. Secondary structures Facchiano et al. [41] observed that 69% of the a-helices of thermophilic proteins are more stable than their mesophilic counterparts. The stabilizing factor was the intrinsic helical propensity of amino acids. Lack of b-branched residues (Val, Thr, Ile) correlated significantly with thermostability.

In the case of xylanases, there is only one a-helix in the structure. The a-helix of thermophilic xylanases showed a higher frequency of Asp and Arg (Table 5). In NFX, the additional Arg160 is located on the protein surface, and Asp156 makes a double salt bridge with Arg58 (Oc1 and Oc2 atoms of aspartic acid and Ng1 and Ng2 atoms of arginine). In CTX, Arg161 makes a salt bridge with Asp57. Hence, the a-helix region of these two enzymes is likely to be stabilized by additional interactions with the loop before the b-strand A5. DTX, NFX and TLX have both Asp and Arg in the a-helix and the residues are located at positions (i, i + 3) or (i, i + 4), which is believed to be stabilizing [42]. In addition, CTX has Met and Phe side chains at positions (i, i + 4), also thought to be stabilizing [43]. In NFX, TLX and CTX, the positively charged Arg is located at the C-terminal end of the a-helix, suggesting that it stabilizes the helix dipole [44]. The total number of positions with a b-strand structure was higher in thermophilic xylanases (Table 5). The thermophilic xylanases had, on average, 123 residues (range 121≠128) in the b-strands and the corresponding number in the mesophilic xylanases was 114 residues (range 106≠118). This result indicates that longer b-strand rigidify the protein and, thus, make it more thermostable. Alkalophilic BAX had as many as 131 residues in its b-strands, which indicates that the overall stability of the b-strands may be important for the alkalitolerance of family 11 xylanases. All thermophiles and BAX have an additional b-strand B1 at the N-terminus, which could have a stabilizing effect. However, mesophilic TRX II and THX also have this additional b-strand. The highly thermostable DTX has a clearly longer b-strand B3 and C-terminal b-strand A4, which most likely stabilize the structure. The C-terminal b-strand A4 gives additional hydrogen bonding with b-strand A5 and the extension of b-strand B3 interacts with a b-strand B4. BAX also has a longer C-terminal b-strand A4 and a short additional b-strand after that. When the three-dimensional structures of all xylanases are superimposed, a striking feature, in addition to the lengths of the terminals, is that thermostable DTX and alkalophilic BAX have a long insertion between b-strands B3 and A5. According to McCarthy et al. [15], the loop between B3 and A5 combined with extended C-terminus of DTX gives additional hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic

has a short helix instead of 310-type helix, but there is no extension of b-strand B3. Furthermore, the structures of cord, thumb and loop regions vary among family 11 xylanases. It has been shown that these areas are flexible both in crystals and in the molecular dynamics simulations [45]. Some of the differences are evident in the ligand binding [35]. Loops are typically the regions with the largest temperature factors, indicating that they might unfold first during thermal denaturation [46]. However, the overall temperature factors of mesophilic and thermophilic xylanases were not comparable because the data sets of different xylanases have been collected at 120 K or at room temperature. Temperature factors are dependent, in addition to the resolution and the programs used in the refinements, on the temperature of crystal during data collection. Several xylanases have short insertions or deletions in the loops (Fig. 3). Mesophilic BCX has a short insertion between b-strands B7 and A6 and mesophilic ANX and AKX have short insertions between b-strands A3 and B3, but there is no clear trend that shortened loops would be associated with thermostability. The loop between b-strands B2 and A2 has an interesting feature that could play a role in thermostability. The thermophilic NFX has Pro in this loop, which increases the rigidity and this might have a stabilizing effect. The other highly thermostable xylanase, DTX, has a deletion in this loop. Disulfide bridges Thermophilic PVX and TLX have a disulfide bridge that connects the C-terminus of the b-strand B9 with the N-terminus of the a-helix. According to the experimental

packing. They suggest that these factors may account for the enhanced thermal stability. In fact, the loop of DTX includes regular secondary structures: the extension of b-strand B3 and 310-type helix. Structurally similar BAX

data, introducing disulfide bridges via site-directed mutagenesis has increased the thermostability in T. reesei and B. circulans xylanases. Disulfide bridges at the N-terminus or in the a-helix region improve the thermostability by 10≠15 ∞C [20,46≠48]. However, the disulfide bridge alone cannot be crucial for the enhanced thermal stability of xylanases due to the fact that highly thermostable DTX, NFX and CTX do not contain disulfide bonds. In DTX, two of the cysteines are close enough to form a disulfide bridge between b-strands B5 and B4 in the catalytic area, but are not reported to do that according to the electron density map [15]. In addition, the mesophilic AKX and ANX have a disulfide bond between the cord and the b-strand B8, indicating that stabilization of the a-helix region as well as other weak areas like N-terminus by various strategies is more important for the thermostability than the disulfide bridge alone. Salt bridges and hydrogen bonds There are increasing data that indicate a role for hydrogen bonds and salt bridges in protein stabilization [37,38]. In family 11 xylanases, the number of salt bridges varies between 2 and 12 (Table 6). There is one completely conserved salt bridge between the C-terminal Glu (or Asp) of b-strand B6 (BAX and BCX have Asp) and Arg of the loop between b-strands B7 and A6. Thermophiles tend to have more salt bridges, but on the other hand mesophilic TRX II has as many as eight salt bridges. Alkalophilic BAX has the largest number of salt bridges, while acidophilic xylanases have the lowest numbers. Apparently, there could be a correlation between alkalitolerance and salt bridges. Thermophilic xylanases have, on average, slightly more hydrogen bonds than mesophilic xylanases, except the total number of hydrogen bonds in thermophilic CTX is lower than that of mesophilic TRX II (Table 6). Thermophiles, especially NFX, have a large number of side chain≠side chain interactions. Packing It has been proposed that thermophilic proteins have a tighter internal packing with smaller and less numerous cavities than mesophilic proteins [49,50]. To study packing, we calculated the protein density and the void volume values for all family 11 xylanases (Table 7). Because thermophilic xylanases have more atoms, the void volumes were divided by the total number of atoms to normalize them. Both the protein density and void volume values for thermophilic and mesophilic xylanases were similar. Only highly thermophilic DTX and alkalophilic BAX have slightly higher protein density and lower void volumes indicating better packing. In the comparison of PDB structures, Karshikoff and Ladenstein [51] have observed that proteins from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms essentially do not differ in packing. They suggest that neither the reduction in packing density nor the reduction of the packing defects can be considered as a common mechanism for increasing thermal stability. On the other hand, Chen et al. [52] observed in the mutagenesis study that the stabilizing mutations in Staphylococcal nuclease resulted in improved packing, with the

volume of the mutant protein's hydrophobic cores decreasing as protein stability increased. Apparently, a few protein families or some members in them may use better packing to improve the thermostability. Our study indicated that highly thermostable DTX may benefit from the better packing. Adaptation to alkaline pH might also benefit from better packing. Hydrophobicity and surface characteristics Because protein cores are typically hydrophobic, increased packing efficiency is often correlated with increased hydrophobicity. Tighter packing can be achieved through the formation of hydrophobic clusters and enhanced van der Waals interactions. Increased hydrophobicity is usually involved in decreased accessible surface areas and a higher percentage of buried atoms [53]. According to our calculations (data not shown), thermophilic xylanases have slightly more apolar interactions on average than mesophilic xylanases, but if the number of interactions are divided with the number of residues, the trend is not as clear anymore. As thermophilic xylanases contains more amino acid residues than mesophilic xylanases, they also have larger accessible surface areas (Table 7). So far, all family 11 xylanases are reported to be monomers, therefore the solvent accessible areas are not buried by oligomerization. When accessible surface area is counted per atom, it appears that DTX and BAX may benefit from increased hydrophobicity as well as better packing. In addition, these two xylanases have on average longer side-chains (atoms per residue) than the other family 11 xylanases studied (Table 7). One type of hydrophobic interaction is the closely packed aromatic ring≠ring interaction, which has been calculated to have nonbonded potential energies between 1 and 2 kcal∆mol)1 [54]. Additional aromatic≠aromatic interactions are believed to contribute to the increased stability [55]. Bacillus D3 xylanases, which belong to family 11 (no PDB coordinates available), have eight additional surface aromatic residues which are believed to form ‘sticky patches’ on the protein surface that may lead to protein aggregation [16]. In addition, introduction of a single tyrosine into the N-terminal region has been reported to improve the thermostability and thermophilicity of Streptomyces xylanase considerably [56]. However, the studied family 11 xylanases did not show any general trend toward increased proportion of aromatic residues (Table 4). It is thought that increased fractional polar surface, which results in added hydrogen bonding to water, contributes to the greater stability [37]. Table 7 shows the solvent accessible areas and the fractions of polar and nonpolar surface areas. Thermophilic xylanases have somewhat larger fractional polar surfaces, especially CTX and DTX. This indicates that polar interactions on the protein surface are important for the stabilization of family 11 xylanases.

Conclusions
It appears from the analysis of three-dimensional structures and sequence properties of family 11 xylanases that there

are several minor modifications that correlate with the increased thermostability. Increase in the frequency of Arg is a known determinant in the thermostability, in the same way as the increase in the Thr : Ser ratio. The bulky side chain of Arg offers a possibility for several hydrogen bonds and involvement in salt bridges. A general stabilizing principle appears to be an improved network of interactions, which is reflected in the increased frequency of total number of atoms, charged amino acids and hydrogen bonds. Another feature appears to be the increase in the number of residues in the b-strands. This indicates that the two-layered b-sheet has an important role in the stability of family 11 xylanases. However, the frequencies of amino acids with high b-forming propensity may either decrease (less Val) or increase (higher Thr : Ser ratio). The a-helix region of thermophilic xylanases is stabilized by various strategies including additional hydrogen bonding, salt bridges or disulfide bridges. It is evident that all these changes increase the protein rigidity, which is a property usually associated with enhanced thermostability. We found also some features that can explain the increased thermostability in specific cases. The highly thermophilic NFX had a great number of side chain≠side chain polar interactions and several salt bridges. There could be a trend in xylanase structures that acidophilic xylanases have only few and alkalophilic BAX several salt bridges. It is possible that alkaline and thermal adaptation use partly the same mechanisms for improving the stability. Better packing of the thermostable DTX and the alkalo-

philic BAX is likely to improve thermostability. Thermophilic CTX and DTX have an increased fractional polar surface, which creates more hydrogen bonds with water. Several experimental studies have been published on the stability of family 11 xylanases. Two major regions affecting the thermostability are the protein N-terminus and the a-helix region [19,20,47,48,56]. Thermophilic xylanases appear to have a more stable a-helix than their mesophilic counterparts. The mechanism of stabilization at the N-terminus is not so obvious. All thermophilic xylanases have an additional b-strand B1 at the N-terminus, but also mesophilic TRX II and THX contain this b-strand. The N-terminus of NFX is a couple of amino acids longer than that of TRX II, but there is no clear reason why the longer N-terminal might increase the stability. However, the extension of the N-terminus of TRX II has been reported to increase the thermostability [57]. The third region with effect on the thermotolerance seems to be the Ser/Thr surface. The introduction of five arginines into this surface increased the apparent temperature optimum by  5 ∞C [39]. Thermophilic CTX has two additional arginines, Arg27 and Arg68, on that surface. Although there are more arginines in thermophilic xylanases, the presence of arginines on Ser/Thr surface does not seem to be a widely used strategy among family 11 xylanases. In conclusion, a number of minor modifications appear to explain the higher stability of thermophilic family 11 xylanases and many thermophilic xylanases have unique features that may increase their stability.
