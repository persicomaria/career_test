Cortisol and the glucocorticoid receptor signaling pathway have been implicated in the development of diabetes and obesity. The reduction of cortisone to cortisol is catalyzed by 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type I (11-HSD1). 2,4-Disubsituted benzenesulfonamides were identified as potent inhibitors of both the human and mouse enzymes. The lead compounds displayed good pharmacokinetics and ex vivo inhibition of the target in mice. Cocrystal structures of compounds 1 and 20 bound to human 11-HSD1 were obtained. Compound 20 was found to achieve high concentrations in target tissues, resulting in 95% inhibition in the ex vivo assay when dosed with a food mix (0.5 mg of drug per g of food) after 4 days. Compound 20 was efficacious in a mouse diet-induced obesity model and significantly reduced fed glucose and fasted insulin levels. Our findings suggest that 11-HSD1 inhibition may be a valid target for the treatment of diabetes.

Introduction More than 150 million people worldwide have diabetes, and this number is expected to rise to 300 million by the year 2025. In the U.S., it is estimated that 21 million people have diabetes, and in some areas of the country, the prevalence is as high as 50%.1 Metabolic syndrome is a prediabetic state that consists of glucose intolerance, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and inflammatory or prothrombotic states.2 As metabolic syndrome progresses to diabetes, complications associated with this disorder become more prominent and include cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, kidney failure, and nerve damage. A number of therapies are presently available for treating diabetes. These include insulin secretagogues, insulin sensitizers, and modulators of glucose uptake and production. Despite these advances, there is an acute need for improved therapies that target the various biological pathways involved in this disease.3 Recent investigations have implicated aberrant glucocorticoid receptor (GRa) signaling in the development of several phenotypes associated with metabolic syndrome. Glucocorticoid hormones are key metabolic regulators. The major

activator of the GR in humans is cortisol, and the adrenal cortex is the major source of circulating cortisol. GR signaling depends not only on the circulating cortisol levels but also on the intracellular generation of cortisol through reduction of cortisone, the inactive glucocorticoid.4 The reduction reaction is catalyzed by 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-HSD1) with the concomitant oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), while cortisone itself is generated by the action of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-HSD2) on cortisol using -nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) as a cofactor.2 These two enzymes have very different expression profiles: 11-HSD1 levels are highest in liver, adipose tissues, and the central nervous system, whereas 11-HSD2 is expressed in kidney, colon, and other tissues.2 Transgenic mice overexpressing 11-HSD1 in adipose tissue show several features of metabolic syndrome including abdominal obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.5 11-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue also correlates positively with body mass index (BMI), fat percentage, and fasting glucose and insulin levels in humans. In addition, liver-specific overexpression of 11-HSD1 in transgenic mice causes insulin resistance without obesity.6 11-HSD1 knockout mice demonstrate reduction in body weight, decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride levels, increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and increased insulin sensitivity when maintained on a high fat diet.7 The combined findings from the knockout mice and the transgenic mice make a compelling case for evaluating 11-HSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. There are reports in the literature of several classes of potent and selective 11-HSD1 inhibitors,8 a few of which display in

vitro efficacy in animal models related to diabetes. Biovitrum reported a thiazole-based selective 11-HSD1 inhibitor that reduced plasma glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in murine models of obesity and type 2 diabetes (Lepob/ob and KKAy, respectively) when dosed at 200 mg/kg bid.9 Thienyl derivatives also showed a similar effect.10 Merck reported triazole-based 11-HSD1 inhibitors that reduced food intake, body weight, fasting glucose, and insulin levels in the dietinduced obesity (DIO) mouse model studies when orally dosed at 20 mg/kg bid.11 Abbott researchers described an adamantyl amide that lowered plasma glucose levels in the ob/ob mouse model in a three-week study with oral dosing at lowest dose of 30 mg/kg bid.12 Additionally, the adamantine lactam 11-HSD1 inhibitor from Abbott induced weight loss and lowered plasma insulin levels in DIO mice when orally dosed at 30 mg/kg bid for 14 days. Plasma triglyceride levels were notably normalized.13 Recently disclosed Pfizer aminopyridine analogue PF-915275 significantly lowered plasma insulin levels (by 54 and 60%, respectively) at 1 and 3 mg/kg, 8 h after dosing in normal cynomolgus monkeys.14 Interestingly, neither plasma glucose nor lipid levels were altered with the treatment. We previously disclosed a series of benzenesulfonamides as potent and selective 11-HSD1 inhibitors.15 We described our efforts to optimize the piperazine ring and the right-hand portion of the molecule along with detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) efforts on the meta position of the left side phenyl ring. Compound 1 (Figure 1) was reported to have an IC50=26 nM against human 11-HSD1 and showed efficacy in the cortisone-induced hyperinsulinemia rat model by lowering insulin levels after 7 days of treatment.15 Compound 1 displayed low to moderate microsomal stability (12 min in presence of mouse microsomes and 17 min in presence of human microsomes). Herein, we wish to report our efforts toward further optimization by focusing on the ortho- and para-positions on the left side phenyl ring (structure 2, Figure 1). We report the ex vivo activity and pharmacokinetic profile of selected compounds and encouraging in vitro efficacy results from DIO studies in mice. Crystal Structure and Optimization Strategy. An X-ray cocrystal structure of compound 1 bound to human 11HSD1 was obtained by X-ray crystallography to a resolution ° of 2.3 A (Figure 2). Analysis of the binding mode revealed some key interactions. The trifluoromethyl group sits in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of L126 and A226 and the backbone of S125. One of the sulfone oxygens makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of A172. The unsubstituted edge of the piperazine ring has close van der Waals interactions with Y183. There are additional van der Waals interactions between the benzylic fluoro substituent and T124 and I121 as well as with the NADP cofactor. The phenyltriazole group of compound 1 contributes to -stacking interactions with Y177 and extends to make van der Waals contacts with P178. Further examination of the

binding pocket on the left side of the molecule 1 (as drawn in Figure 1) revealed an opportunity for introducing groups at the ortho and para positions of the benzenesulfonamide. There is a depression in the van der Waals surface of the protein adjacent to G216 that might be accessed by small groups at the ortho position of the benzene sulfonamide. The para position points toward a solvent exposed cleft at the interface between dimeric partners in the enzyme complex, suggesting that it could accept potentially larger and more polar solubilizing substituents that could lead to improved physicochemical and ADME properties. Thus we embarked in SAR studies focused on the ortho and para positions of the benzenesulfonamide. Chemistry. Scheme 1 depicts the synthesis of para-substituted benzenesulfonamides.

reaction was run without the addition of ethanol. The ethyl group in the final product 18a was likely derived from diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD). Scheme 4 shows the syntheses of the 4-amido analogue 20. This analogue was prepared using similar procedures described for the preparation of compounds 9 in Scheme 1. Results and Discussion Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR). Examination of the binding mode of compound 1 revealed the possibility of further optimization at the para position of the sulfonamide phenyl ring. Of particular interest was the possibility of introducing polar groups, as suggested by the crystal structure information, to improve the physicochemical and ADME profiles of the molecules. Synthesized compounds were first evaluated in a cell-based assay using a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line expressing 11HSD1. The assay was run in duplicate; the compounds were tested in 11-point dilutions and the standard error of IC50 was <10% (See Experimental Section for assay protocols). Table 1 summarizes the in vitro data for selected compounds with substitutions at the para position. As predicted from the crystal structure, substitution at the para position was well tolerated. Compounds such as the cyano analogue 7b and the morpholino analogue 8b retained good potency (IC50 = 10 nM). Other analogues such as the alkyl ethers 7c and 7d, the piperidine 8a, and the amide 9 also displayed good inhibitory activity against the human enzyme. Introduction of a weakly acidic tetrazole at the para position (compound 10) led to a significant drop in potency. Most para-substituted analogues displayed good human microsomal stability (t1/2 >30 min) and moderate mouse microsomal stability. Once we established that the para position of the benzenesulfonamide series tolerates a range of substituents, we expanded the scope of our investigations by exploring 2,4disubstituted benzenesulfonamides. Several groups, such as Cl, F, MeO, and CO2H, were introduced at the ortho position. In general, the ortho Cl group was found to offer the best balance in terms of potency and ex vivo activity (data not shown). The remaining of the discussion will focus on ortho Cl analogues with various substituents at the para position. Table 2 summarizes the SAR for this series of analogues. Most of the 2-chloro-4-amino analogues showed good inhibition of human and mouse 11-HSD1 with IC50 values in the low nM range. For example, the tertiary amine analogues 13a

Buchwald amination of bromide 7a with secondary amines in the presence of Pd2(dba)3 and t-BuONa in toluene provided the desired 4-amino benzenesulfonamides 8a and 8b in good yields. Treatment of the cyano derivative 7b with KOH in t-BuOH provided 4-amide analogue 9 in near quantitative yield. Reaction of 7b with NaN3 led to formation of the desired tetrazole analogue 10 in 61% isolated yield. 2-Chloro- and 2-fluoro-4-amino-analogues 13 and 15 were synthesized as shown in Scheme 2. 4-tert-Butyl ethers 14a (Y=Cl) and 14b (Y=F) were occasionally isolated in variable yields. The formation of these ether analogues was likely due to the presence of t-BuONa in the reaction mixture. Copper catalyzed C-N bond formation of the 4-bromobenzenesulfonamide 12a (X=Br) with nitrogen-containing heterocycles led to the corresponding 4-amino-heterocyclic benzenesulfonamides 15a and 15b. 2-Chloro-4-alkoxy-analogues were also prepared (Scheme 3). t-Bu ether 14a was converted to phenol 16 in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Alkylation of 16 with methyl-2chloro-2,2-difluoroacetate led to 17. Mitsunobu reaction with alkyl alcohols furnished analogues 18b and 18c. Interestingly, compound 18a was formed when the Mitsunobu

and 13b had IC50 values in the 10 nM range for human and mouse 11-HSD1. Alkyl amines such as 13a, 13b, and 13c showed poor microsomal stability (t1/2 = 2-6 min for mouse

microsomes). Introduction of one or two fluoro substituents at the 4-position of the piperidine ring (13d and 13e, respectively) led to a significant improvement in the microsomal stability (t1/2> 30 min) with a comparable potency versus the human enzyme compared to the des-fluoro analogue 13c. Introduction of polar groups at the piperidine 4-position was also well tolerated: 13f-i all showed low nM inhibition of human and mouse 11-HSD1 and good microsomal stability in human liver microsomes (t1/2> 30 min). Further exploration of the para position led to compounds in Table 3. Replacing the piperidine ring in 13c with a morpholino group led to analogue 13j. Compound 13j was found to be equipotent to its parent des-chloro analogue 8b against human 11-HSD1 but displayed a 36-fold improvement against the mouse enzyme in the presence of serum when compared to the des-chloro analogue 8b. The orthofluoro analogue 13k also showed strong inhibitory activity against the human 11-HSD1 (IC50 = 11 nM). The 2,6-dimethyl morpholino analogue 13l showed a decrease in potency against both the human and mouse enzymes. The morpholino urea analogue 12c also showed a significant drop in potency against both human and mouse enzymes but displayed good microsomal stability (t1/2>30 min) in the presence of human and mouse liver microsomes. Piperazine analogues 13m and 13n showed 14- and 64-fold drops in potency against human 11-HSD1, respectively, when compared to the morpholino analogue 13j, suggesting that positively charged moieties are not well tolerated at this

position. The less basic piperazinones 13p and 15a retained the same level of potency against the human enzyme, as did the neutral sulfone 13o and the triazole analogue 15b. Most of these analogues had good stability in human and mouse microsomes. In addition to 2-chloro-4-amino analogues 13a-j, 13l-p, and 15a-b, we also explored 2-chloro-4-alkoxy-disubstituted species (Table 4). All of the 2-chloro-4-alkyoxy analogues showed moderate to good inhibitory activity against both the human and mouse enzymes. Compounds 17 and 18c have good microsomal stability against human microsome (t1/2 > 30 min) but in general the mouse microsomal stability was poor. Examples of 2-chloro-4-carbon analogues include 19 to 20. The amido analogue 20 was also potent against both the human and mouse enzymes and displayed excellent microsomal stability (t1/2 >30 min). The structure of compound 20 bound to human 11° HSD1 was also obtained by X-ray crystallography to a 2.2 A resolution (Figure 3). We observed that compounds 1 and 20 bind in a similar fashion: in both structures, one of the sulfone oxygens makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of A172. However, compounds 1 and 20 also exhibit distinct differences in their protein interactions due to the differences in benzylic substitution pattern. As a result, different induced fit effects on the binding pocket are observed. The dihedral angle of the bond joining the sulfonamide sulfur to the phenyl ring differs by 21° between the two compounds. This rotation is necessary to accommodate meta versus para substitutions with minimal remodeling of the pocket. In compound 20, the phenyl ring, which the chloro group attaches to, rotates so that the ortho chloro group can participate, along with neighboring ring atoms, in van der Waals interactions with Y177. Electrostatic interaction between the amide oxygen and the hydroxyl of Y177 may also contribute to the binding of this compound. We

also observed an additional interaction between the ortho Cl group with the piperazine nitrogen through van der Waals interaction, which could further stabilize the bound conformation of the inhibitor. It is highly desirable that 11-HSD1 inhibitors show selectivity against 11-HSD2 bacause mutation of 11-HSD2 is known to cause mineralocorticoid excess and hypertension due to kidney mineralocoticoid receptor activation.17 The 11-HSD1 inhibitors described in this report showed no activity against human 11-HSD2 when tested at 100 M. Ex vivo and Pharmacokinetics Results. A selected number of compounds were evaluated in the ex vivo assays and 11HSD1 inhibition was measured in liver, fat, or both. Mice were sacrificed 5 h after oral dosing. The liver and epididymal fat were collected, and the whole tissue was incubated in the presence of [3H]-cortisone in the media. After 30 min, cortisol levels were measured to determine the level of compound inhibition from [3H]-cortisone to [3H]-cortisol. The liver and/or fat ex vivo data are summarized in Table 5.

An interesting trend emerged when comparing the 2-chloro analogues versus the 2-des-chloro analogues. The chloro analogue 13j (Y = Cl) showed 56% ex vivo inhibition in the liver and 54% inhibition in the fat when orally dosed at 10 mg/kg. In contrast, the des-chloro analogue 8b (Y = H) showed marginal liver inhibition even when tested at higher dose (50 mg/kg). Similarly, the chloro analogue 20 showed 80% inhibition at 10 mpk in epididymal fat (Y=Cl), while the des-chloro analogue 9 showed only 25% inhibition at the same dose (Y=H). Replacing the 2-Cl group in compound 13j with a fluoro group (13k) had a dramatic effect on the ex vivo potency of this compound. A significant drop in potency both in the liver and fat was observed (<10% inhibition at 10 mg/kg). The carboxylic acid analogue 13h and amido analogue 13i showed good ex vivo inhibition in liver (59 and 56%, respectively) when dosed at 10 mg/kg. Compound 13h also showed a 40% inhibition in the epididymal fat ex vivo assay. On the basis of the ex vivo inhibition data, a few compounds were selected for evaluation of pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in C57B6 mice. Compounds were dosed by iv injection (2 mg/kg) and oral administration (10 mg/kg). The results are summarized in Table 6. With the exception of compound 13j, all of the compounds showed low to moderate clearance and moderate to high oral bioavailability (35-100%). It is worth mentioning that no direct correlation was observed between plasma AUC values from Table 6 and ex vivo inhibition in liver and fat in Table 5. For instance, of the compounds reported in Table 6, compound 13j has the lowest plasma AUC but still displayed good ex vivo inhibition both in the liver and fat. In contrast, compound 9 has a high AUC but showed no activity in the ex vivo assay. These results can be rationalized considering the specific tissue distribution of the target. The AUC values reported in Table 6 measure compound levels in the plasma, while 11HSD1 is expressed in the liver and adipose tissue. Achieving potent inhibition of 11-HSD1 in the target tissues is likely to require a balanced profile in terms of potency and pharmacokinetics as well as tissue penetration. A manuscript detailing our findings will be reported in due course.18 With a number of compounds demonstrating appropriate in vitro, ex vivo, and PK properties, we decided to perform in vivo proof of concept studies. In this report, we wish to present our preliminary in vitro results for compound 20.

Design and Results of the in vivo Studies. The relationship between cortisol and insulin is important to energy balance and can become dysregulated with chronic stress.19 Cortisol has been shown to directly inhibit insulin secretion from pancreatic -cells,20 eventually leading to insulin resistance. We reasoned that administering our compounds using oral gavage for a prolonged period (28 days) could lead to a significant stress response and impact cortisol levels in animals, ultimately affecting insulin and glucose levels. Therefore, we decided to mix the compound in food in order to minimize handling of the animals. Before we could move forward with the food mix in vivo studies with compound 20, we confirmed that this compound displays a significant level of ex vivo inhibition when mixed in food. B6-DIO mice (n= 4) were given a high fat diet containing 0.5 mg of compound 20 per g of high fat diet for 96 h. Mice consumed 2.5 g of high fat food and compound mixture per day, indicating that the dose of the compound was 30 mg/kg. All mice were sacrificed, and liver and fat tissues were collected as described in the Experimental Section. Table 7 summarizes the liver ex vivo inhibition using the food mix studies as well as compound levels in liver and fat. Compound 20 showed 95% inhibition after 96 h of dosing. Significant levels of compound 20 were found in target tissues (liver and fat) when measured. On the basis of its favorable ex vivo profile and tissue distribution, compound 20 was advanced to a 28-day food mix study in DIO mice. C57/B6 DIO mice (26 weeks old, 20 weeks on high fat diet, 60% calories from fat) were

given a high fat diet containing 0.5 mg of compound per gram of high fat diet for 28 days. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, compound 20 significantly reduced fed glucose as well as fasting insulin levels. No effect was observed on the fasted glucose and the fed insulin. Effects on both food intake and body weight were not observed, and the animals appeared active and healthy with no visible abnormalities. Conclusion In summary, we have reported the synthesis and in vitro/in vivo activity of novel potent and selective 2,4-disubsituted benzenesulfonamides. This class of compounds showed good potency against human and mouse 11-HSD1 and displayed good pharmacokinetics in mice and robust ex vivo inhibition in the liver and fat. To minimize stress response in animals, we administered compound 20 in a high-fat diet food mix. We established that compound 20 achieved high concentrations in target tissues and showed 95% inhibition in the ex vivo assay. A 28-day DIO efficacy study in mice with compound 20 showed a significant reduction in the fed glucose as well as the fasted insulin levels. Experimental Section

Cellular Assays. Determination of IC50 against Human 11HSD1. Compounds described herein were tested in a cell-based assay using a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line expressing human 11-HSD1. Cells were plated at 20000 cells/ well in 384-well plates and incubated overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cells were treated with different concentration of compound in 90 L of serum-free media and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C/5%CO2. Cortisone (10 L of 5 M, final concentration 500 nM) was then added to the cells and the plate was incubated at 37 °C/5%CO2 for 120 min. Then 15 L of media was withdrawn and the amount of cortisol in the media was measured using the DiscoverX HitHunter cortisol assay (DiscoverX corp, CA), following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 15 L media was transferred to a white 384-well assay plate. Then 5 L of anticortisol antibody and 10 L of enzyme donor (ED) complex were added to each well of the assay plate. The assay plate was incubated at rt for 60 min with gentle shaking. Galacton Star, Emerald Green, and chemiluminescence substrate buffer were mixed 1:5:19. The mixture was then combined in equal parts with enzyme acceptor (EA) complex. Then 20 L of the mix was added to each well of the assay plate and the assay plate was incubated at room temperature for another 60 min. The plate was read in Envision multilabel plate reader (Perkin-Elmer, MA) in the enhanced luminescence mode. Background subtracted data was fitted to y=aþ(b/(1þx/IC50)), and IC50 values were calculated using XLFit (IDBS, MA). Determination of IC50 against Mouse 11-HSD1. To determine the IC50 against mouse 11-HSD1, a stable CHO cell line expressing mouse 11-HSD1 was used and the above procedure was followed. Determination of IC50 against Mouse 11-HSD1 in the Presence of Serum. To determine the IC50 against mouse 11-HSD1 in the presence of serum, 10% defibrinated, delipidized, charcoal stripped human serum (Seracare Life Sciences, CA) was added during the incubation with compound and cortisone. The above procedure was followed. Evaluation of Inhibition of Human 11-HSD2. To determine the potency of compounds against mouse 11-HSD2, a stable CHO cell line expressing human 11-HSD2 is generated. Cells were plated at 20000 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C/5% CO2. Cells were treated with different concentration of compound in 90 L of serum-free media and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C/5%CO2. Then 10 L of 500 nM [3H]-Cortisone (ARC Inc., MO) was added to each well of the plate (final concentration = 50 nM). The plate was incubated for 120 min. Cortisone and cortisol were separated on a PRP-1 (Hamilton Inc., NV) on an Agilent 1100 high pressure liquid chromatography system with a 500TR flow scintillation analyzer (Perkin-Elmer, MA). Carbenoxolone (Sigma, MO) was used as a control 11-HSD2 inhibitor. Evaluation of 11-HSD1 Inhibitors in Mouse ex Vivo Assay. To characterize the inhibitors of 11-HSD1, inhibitors were tested in mouse tissue ex vivo assay. Male C57Bl6 mice 810 weeks of age were grouped based on body weight (Taconic Farms on standard chow diet). The compounds were suspended in 0.5% methyl cellulose/2%tween in water. All mice were orally dosed and sacrificed 2-5 h after dosing (n = 4). Liver and epididymal fat tissues were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue 11-HSD1 ex vivo assay measured the conversion of [3H]-cortisone to [3H]-cortisol, and percent inhibition of 11HSD1 activity in the liver was determined in reference to vehicle treated mice. then 50-60 mg of frozen liver tissue was placed in 48-well plates (kept on dry ice). The tissue/48-well plates were thawed at rt for 15 min, and then 250 L of PBS were added to each well and incubated for additional 15 min at rt. The 48-well plate was placed on a 37 °C Eppendorf Thermomixer R plate shaker, and 250 L of PBS containing 2.5 Ci of [3H]-cortisone

was added to each well and allowed to incubate for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 L of 10% TFA. Reaction aliquot (20 L) was analyzed by HPLC and percent conversion of [3H]-cortisone to [3H]-cortisol determined (t test, *p<0.05). Evaluation of 11-HSD1 Inhibitors in Mouse ex Vivo Assay with Food Mix. All experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wyeth Research. Diet induced obese mice were individually housed and maintained under 12L:12D cycle (6 a.m./6 p.m.). Prior to implementing the long-term efficacy study, we evaluated the properties of 11-HSD-1 inhibitor when mixed with high fat diet (Research Diet D12492). Two weeks prior to initiation of dosing regimen, one-half of 18 weeks old C57B6 DIO mice that had been on a high fat diet for 12 weeks from Taconic were placed in reversed light cycle room (remaining one-half in normal light cycle, where mice were subjected to a 14 h shift in light cycle (dark cycle began on 8 a.m. and light cycle began on 8 p.m.). This ensured that blood and tissue collection could take place during normal light cycle from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Diurnal rhythm in the feeding behavior of rodents dictated that these nocturnal animals consumed majority of the food during the corresponding dark phase. The peak feeding time for the nocturnal rodents were at on set of darkness; therefore theoretical peak for the compound concentration in serum was estimated to occur 4 h after lights off (10 a.m.). Likewise, rodent food intake dramatically decreased at the onset of light; therefore we estimated that the theoretical low for the compound concentration in serum to occur 4 h after lights on (10 p.m.). C57Bl6 DIO mice were fed with food mixed with compounds at 0.5 mg/g food for 96 h. The mice that were under normal light cycle condition were sacrificed at 10 a.m. (Table 7, day 4, 10 a.m.) and mice that under reverse light cycle were sacrificed at 12 p.m. (Table 7, day 4, 10 p.m.). The fat and liver tissues were collected. The drug concentration was determined by HPLC analysis, and liver food mix ex vivo was conducted as discussed. For all studies, compounds were sent to Research Diet and compound/food mixture was prepared according to Research Diet Standard Operation Procedure. The results are expressed in ng/mL for serum and ng/ g for liver and fat. Each value represents mean ( SEM of mice (n= 6). The data was analyzed by performing t test with two-tail distribution, two-sample unequal variance and asterisks indicate statistical significance at p<0.05 vs vehicle. X-Ray Crystallographic Studies Including Protocol for Getting and Resolving X-Ray Structures. 11-HSD1 residues 24-292 C272S was prepared in the presence of CHAPS as described.21 Crystals were grown using the hanging drop method with a reservoir solution of 100 mM HEPES pH 6.8-7.1 and 16-18% PEG 3350. Crystals were soaked from 1-3 d in reservoir solution containing compound at 0.5-1 mM, and 0.1% glutaraldehyde was added to the well to stabilize the crystals during soaking. The crystals were cryoprotected in paratone oil and flash frozen in a cryo-stream. X-ray data was collected using a Rigaku FR-E X-ray generator and a Rigaku Saturn92 CCD detector. Data was reduced using HKL2000.22 The structure was solved by using phenix.refine23 for rigid body fitting of the published structure of HSD1 with CHAPS (1XU9). Each protein chain was treated as an independent rigid body. The structure was refined through iterative manual rebuilding and reciprocal space refinement using COOT24 and phenix.refine. The structure was further validated using Molprobity.25 Pharmacokinetic and Metabolic Stability Studies. Pharmacokinetics of 11-HSD1 inhibitors was determined in male C57/B6 mice (20-30 g, Taconic Farm, NY) after iv or po administration. The compounds were prepared in DSM/PEG-200/saline solution for the iv administration or in 0.5% MC/2% TW/water as a suspension for the po administration. Blood samples were collected over a period of 24 h, and plasma samples were harvested and stored at -80 °C until assay. The target tissues (liver and muscle) were also collected at selected time points. Tissues were homogenized in saline, and the drug concentra-

tions in the homogenates were analyzed. Quantization of HSD1 inhibitors in plasma and tissue homogenate was carried with a verified LC/MS/MS method. In vitro metabolic half-life (t1/2) and metabolic pathways were determined in liver microsomes from rats, mice, and humans using an NADPH regenerating system consisting of MgCl2 (10 mM), glucose-6-phosphate (3.6 mM), NADPþ (1.3 mM), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (0.4 units/mL) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4), UDPGA (4 mM), and substrate (1 mM for metabolic stability and 10 mM for metabolite profiling). Incubations were initiated by the addition of the NADPH generating system and conducted for up to 30 min in a shaker-water bath at 37 °C. For the determination of in vitro metabolic half-life, aliquots of the incubation mixture were removed at 0, 10, 20, and 30 min and added to acetonitrile containing the appropriate internal standard. Following centrifugation and evaporation of the supernatant liquid, the samples were reconstituted in 20% methanol in water for analysis by LC/MS. In Vivo Study through Food Mix. male DIO-B6 mice, 26 weeks old (Taconic, Diet D12492, 60% fat, n = 12), were used to evaluate in vitro efficacy of compound 20 in this reversal model. The mice were grouped based on body weight and serum insulin levels and placed one per cage and fed on high fat diet (60% fat kcal, 35.5% fat, F1850, BioServ, paste formula of no. 3282) 7 weeks prior start of the study. A food mix was prepared by mixing 0.5 mg of compound 20 with 1 g of the high fat diet (prepared by Research Diet). The mice were fed with this mixture for 31 days. Body weights and food intake were weekly measured. Fed glucose and insulin levels were obtained at day 21, and fasting glucose and insulin levels were obtained at day 26 by tail bleeding. To minimize the effects of stress induced fasting, fed glucose and insulin values were first recorded and then 5 days later fasting values were obtained. Mice were sacrificed under "stress free" conditions at the end of study, and serum and tissues were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Serum and tissues were collected for analysis. The results (Figures 4 and 5) are expressed in ng/mL for insulin and mg/dL for glucose . Each value represents mean ( SEM of mice (n=12). The data was analyzed by performing t test with two-tail distribution, two-sample unequal variance, and asterisks indicate statistical significance at p < 0.05 vs vehicle.
