An ability to acquire iron is essential for the viability and growth of almost all organisms and in pathogenic bacteria is strongly correlated with virulence. The cell surface lipoprotein MtsA, a component of the MtsABC transporter of Streptococcus pyogenes, acts as the primary receptor for inorganic iron by this significant human pathogen. Iron is bound as Fe2+, with the participation of bicarbonate. The crystal ° structure of MtsA has been determined and refined at 1.8 A resolution (R = 0.167, and Rfree = 0.194). MtsA has the classic bacterial metal binding receptor (MBR) fold, with the Fe2+ ion bound to the side chains of His68, His140, Glu206, and Asp281, at a totally enclosed site between the two domains of the protein. The absence of bicarbonate from the binding site suggests that it is displaced during the final stages of metal binding. Both the fold and metal binding site are most similar to those of the manganese receptors PsaA and MntC, consistent with the similar coordination requirements of Fe2+ and Mn2+. Binding studies confirm a 10-fold preference for Fe2+ over Mn2+, although both may be carried in vivo. Mutational analysis of the binding site shows that His140 is critical for a fully functional binding site but that Glu206 is dispensable. The crystal structure explains the distinct roles of these ligands and also reveals potential secondary binding sites that may explain the binding behavior of MtsA for metal ions other than Fe2+.

ABSTRACT:

Iron is essential for the growth of almost all organisms because of the requirement for iron as a cofactor in many important proteins that mediate processes as diverse as oxygen and electron transport, energy production, and DNA synthesis. For pathogenic organisms, iron is therefore an important determinant of survival and virulence (1, 2). To overcome the limited availability of free iron in the host environment, due to its insolubility in the presence of oxygen and its potential sequestration by host proteins, bacterial pathogens have developed a variety of mechanisms for iron acquisition (3). Whereas some organisms synthesize specialized iron chelators known as siderophores,

others produce membrane-spanning ATP-binding cassette (ABC)1 transporters (4) to scavenge iron from their microenvironments, in the form of free ferric/ferrous ions, chelated iron, or heme. Since these iron acquisition systems are surface-exposed and required for bacterial growth in the host, they are potential drug targets and vaccine candidates. In contrast to the abundant information about the iron uptake mechanisms in Gram-negative bacteria (5), there is much more limited knowledge of the mechanisms for iron acquisition in Gram-positive bacteria. Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a Gram-positive human pathogen that causes a variety of human diseases, including pharyngitis, scarlet fever, necrotizing fasciitis, and streptococcal toxic shock (6). This organism has systems that can mediate the uptake of iron in several forms, as inorganic iron, heme, or chelated iron (7). MtsABC, a typical ABC transporter comprising a lipoprotein MtsA, an ATP-binding protein MtsB, and a hydrophobic integral membrane protein MtsC, provides the machinery for the uptake of inorganic iron in S. pyogenes (8, 9). MtsA, which is anchored to the cell membrane via a lipid moiety covalently attached to its N-terminal cysteine (10), functions as a metal ion chelator and transporter. With the ATPbinding protein providing energy, MtsA then interacts with the integral membrane component, leading to iron release and subsequent transmembrane uptake (8, 10).

Article In recent years, MtsA has been cloned, expressed, and characterized (7-9, 11). Its amino acid sequence shows that it belongs to a large family of bacterial metal binding receptor (MBR) proteins (12). Its closest relative for which structural data are available is the manganese receptor PsaA from Streptococcus pneumoniae (13), with which it shares 80% sequence identity. Divergent results regarding the metal specificity of MtsA have, however, been reported from cellular studies in different laboratories (7-9). We recently showed that MtsA primarily binds ferrous ion, with bicarbonate as a synergistic anion, under relevant physiological conditions (11), consistent with the fact that MtsA is regulated in response to iron levels (7, 14). Apart from these results, however, little is known about the detailed relationship between the structure and function of MtsA. Here we report the crystal structure of the Fe2+-bound form of ° MtsA (Fe-MtsA) at 1.8 A resolution, enabling this protein to be placed in the context of the wider MBR family. The observed specificity for Fe2+ is explained by the nature of the ligands in the primary coordination sphere. The preparation of mutant versions of MtsA, in which the metal-binding ligands were systematically changed, coupled with studies of iron and manganese binding and iron release, has also allowed the respective roles of these ligands in structure and function to be determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. Chemicals used were of the highest available commercial quality. Stock solutions of HEPES, Tris-HCl, and other buffers were prepared by dissolving the respective anhydrous salts in Milli-Q water (Millipore) and adjusting the pH to the desired values with 1 M NaOH or 1 M HCl. Freshly prepared solutions of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 were used as the source of Fe2+. One-kilodalton mini dialysis kits, Factor Xa, ampicillin, and isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) were obtained from Amersham. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) star competent cells were purchased from Invitrogen. GST-binding resins were supplied by Novagen. Centricon-10 and -30 microconcentrators were obtained from Millipore. Other chemicals not specified were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein Expression and Purification. Wild-type (WT) MtsA was expressed and purified as previously described (11). H68A, H140A, E206A, and D281A mutations were individually introduced into MtsA using the PCR-based QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), with the MtsA-GST plasmid as a template. To further study the collective contribution of H68, H140, E206, and D281 to the metal binding ability of MtsA, the tetrapoint mutation H68A/H140A/E206A/D281A was produced by mutating these four amino acids to alanine. The mutated plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (TechDragon, HK) and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) star competent cells. Expression and purification of the five MtsA mutants followed the same general protocol as for the WT protein (11). Equilibrium Dialysis and ICP-MS. Binding of Fe2+ and Mn2+ to WT and mutant MtsA was assessed using equilibrium dialysis and ICP-MS, as previously described (11). Purified proteins (200 L at a concentration of 1 M) were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 1 kDa dialysis tubing against solutions containing various concentrations of Fe2+ or Mn2+, from 0 to 150 M. These solutions were made up with either Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 or MnCl2 in 1.0 L of 50 mM HEPES and 10 M NaHCO3 (pH 7.4). Buffers were degassed for 20 min with constant mixing before the experiments and sealed with parafilm.

The concentrations of metal ions were determined by ICP-MS following centrifugation at 12000g for 20 min to remove any possible insoluble species. The data were subjected to Hill analysis for the determination of the stoichiometry and binding affinity. Kinetics of Release of Fe2+ from WT-MtsA and Mutants. The removal of Fe2+ from WT and mutant proteins [25 M in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4)] was monitored by UV-visible spectroscopy, based on the electronic spectral measurements previously reported (11). The change in absorbance at 365 nm was measured against a reference containing only the buffer and chelator (EGTA). Release constants were obtained by fitting the absorbance-versus-time data to a single-exponential function with Origin 7.1, giving R2 values (coefficients of determination) of >0.98 in every case (15). Crystallization and Data Collection. Crystallization trials were conducted in sitting drops (100 nL of protein and 100 nL of precipitant) using a Cartesian HONEYBEE nanoliter dispensing robot (Genomic Solutions) and an in-house 480-condition crystallization screen (16). After optimization, the best crystals of FeMtsA grew at 18 °C in sitting drops comprising 2 L of protein solution [12.0 mg/mL in 50 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaHCO3, and 150 mM NaCl] and 1 L of reservoir solution [27-28% PEG MME 2K, 0.1 M MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPESKOH (pH 7.4)]. Thin, platelike, pale yellow crystals grew after 5-7 days. Crystals were flash-frozen for data collection after immersion in a cryoprotectant solution corresponding to the reservoir conditions supplemented with 22% (v/v) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline 9-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Menlo Park, ° CA). A complete data set was collected to 1.8 A resolution and processed with MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (17). The crystals were orthorhombic, in space group ° P212121, with a Matthews coefficient of 1.99 A3/Da (38% ° solvent) and the following unit cell dimensions: a = 38.26 A, ° ° b = 50.08 A, and c = 157.62 A. Data collection and processing statistics are listed in Table 1. Structure Determination. Phases for the Fe-MtsA structure were determined by molecular replacement using PHASER (18). An ensemble of homologous structures comprising Synechocystis 6803 ZnuA (19) (PDB entry 1pq4), Treponema pallidum TroA (20) (PDB entry 1toa), and S. pneumoniae PsaA (13) (PDB entry 1psz) was used as a search model. This was followed by iterative cycles of refinement with REFMAC (21), incorporating translation/libration/screw (TLS) refinement (22) interleaved with rounds of model building using COOT (23). The conformation of the metal ligands and the site of the metal ion were checked at several times during the refinement, with omit maps, and found to have excellent electron density. Water molecules were added automatically and then manually checked. Only those that had good spherical electron density, reasonable B factors, and favorable hydrogen bonding contacts were retained in the model. The quality of the model was checked periodically with MOLPROBITY (24). Final refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. RESULTS Overall Structure of MtsA. The current model of MtsA consists of 280 amino acids (residues 31-310), one Fe2+ ion, and 268 water molecules. The protein fold (Figure 1) has the classic two-domain organization found for the wider superfamily of bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and other solute

binding receptors (25), but with a specific topology that is characteristic of the metal binding receptor (MBR) family (12). The most striking feature of this fold is a long R-helix [residues 164-190, helix d0 in the terminology used for PsaA (13)] that runs the full length of the molecule, providing the only link between the N- and C-terminal domains (13, 20). This helix gives a relatively rigid backbone to the structure but is slightly curved, subtending an angle of 10°. Two (R/)4 domains, each comprising a four-stranded -sheet with helices packed on either face, pack against this helix and face each other across a large interface which provides the ligands for the metal binding site. The two domains can be superimposed with a root-mean° square (rms) difference in atomic positions of 3.0 A for 89 of 116 CR atoms in spite of having a sequence identity of only 11%. This gives a pseudosymmetric character to the domain interface. The ° metal binding site is 6 A from one end of the interface and ° from the backbone helix d0 at the other end of the interface 20 A (Figure 1). Between the metal binding site and helix d0 is a large ° buried surface comprising 1170 A2 of the N-domain (15% of its ° 2 of the C-domain (18% of its surface). total surface) and 1229 A This buried surface includes 13 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge that are formed across the interface. The helical backbone in MtsA and other MBRs raises the question of how bound metal ions or other ligands are released. There is no evidence for large hinge-bending conformational changes like those that occur for the PBPs (26). Rather, the position of the metal binding site so close to the outer end of the interface suggests that only limited movement is needed to effect metal ion release (20, 26). This could occur by straightening of the backbone helix, such as is seen for the B12-binding protein BtuF (27), in which this helix is straight and the two domains are farther apart, to accommodate the larger B12 molecule. Alternatively, movement of some of the metal ligands may be sufficient, as is seen in a metal-free variant of ZnuA (28).

Comparison with Other MBR Proteins. Searches of the Protein Data Bank using SSM (29) show that the closest structural homologues of MtsA are the two manganese receptor proteins, PsaA from S. pneumoniae (13) and MntC from Synechocystis 6803 (30). These align very closely with MtsA: for PsaA, ° the rms difference is only 0.64 A for 277 CR atom positions (97% of the modeled structure), and for MntC, the rms difference is ° 1.24 A for 266 CR atoms. The next closest homologue (rms ° difference of 1.43 A for 262 CR atoms) is TroA from Treponema pallidum (20), which has specificity for both manganese and zinc, followed by zinc receptors such as ZnuA (19, 31, 32) and ° AdcAII (33) with rms differences of 2.0 A. These structural relationships nicely fit with sequence-based phylogenetic analyses (12, 33), which have enabled the MBRs to be subdivided into subfamilies that are specific either for iron and manganese or for zinc. Iron Binding Site. The iron binding site of MtsA is located ° 6 A below the molecular surface, between the two domains (Figure 1). The four iron ligands comprise two histidines and two carboxylates and are contributed by both domains, and different structural elements within them. The two histidine ligands, His68 and His140, are contributed by the N-terminal domain, with His68 close to the opening of the binding cleft, where its N1 atom is exposed to solvent, and His140 deeply buried at the back. The two carboxylate ligands, Glu206 and Asp281, are both contributed by the C-terminal domain and also differ in their exposure, with Glu206 closer to the opening of the cleft and

Article Asp281 more buried. It is significant that the two ligands that move in the zinc-free form of ZnuA (28) are the outermost ligands, corresponding to His68 and Glu206 in MtsA. Although the metal ion is bound to only these protein ligands, this part of the interface is not tightly packed and contains a number of solvent molecules that occupy small cavities. The Fe2+ ion is coordinated through four strong bonds and two weaker interactions (Table 2), generating a highly distorted

octahedral site in which both carboxylate ligands have asymmetric bidentate coordination (Figure 2). The metal ion is completely enclosed by the four ligands, leaving no coordination position available for solvent (water or bicarbonate) unless one of the protein ligands was to dissociate. The metal coordination environment is identical to that of the two manganese-binding MBRs, PsaA and MntC (13, 30). The metal binding sites for both of the latter proteins have some uncertainty, however; for PsaA, this concerns the identity of the bound metal (Mn or Zn), whereas for MntC, the resolution of the structure was only moderate ° (2.9 A). The metal ion bound in our MtsA structure is assumed to be Fe2+, from its mode of preparation and color, although it is possible that some oxidation to Fe3+ takes place during crystallization, since the binding site will accept both, albeit with a 3-fold preference for Fe2+ over Fe3+ (11). In any case, the metal binding mode seen here serves as a model for the subfamily of iron- and manganese-specific MBRs, which all share two His and two Glu/ Asp ligands, in contrast to the zinc-specific MBRs which have three His ligands and one Glu/Asp (12, 33). Mutational Analysis of Binding and Release. The individual and collective importance of the four iron-binding ligands was tested by mutagenesis. The resulting four single-point mutant proteins, H68A, H140A, E206A, and D281A, and one tetrapoint mutant, H68A/H140A/E206A/D281A, were expressed and purified with procedures similar to those used for WT-MtsA (11). Binding constants for binding of both Fe2+ and Mn2+ to the mutant MtsAs were determined by equilibrium dialysis and ICPMS (Figures S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information). These data showed that both WT-MtsA and the E206A mutant had

approximately 1:1 stoichiometry with Fe2+ and that the affinity of E206A for Fe2+ was only slightly reduced (1.5-fold). The other mutants had much lower stoichiometries, with affinities reduced 18-fold for D281A, 46-fold for H68A, 60-fold for H140A, and more than 100-fold for the tetra mutant (Table 3). Even the tetra mutant exhibited some residual binding (0.3 mol), presumably nonspecific. Similar patterns were seen for Mn2+ binding (Table 3). WT-MtsA binds Mn2+ 10-fold more weakly than Fe2+. The reduction in binding affinity of the mutants was much less pronounced than for Fe2+, ranging from 1.5-fold for E206A and D281A to 5-fold for the tetra mutant, reflecting a higher contribution from nonspecific binding. Measurement of iron release kinetics, using a competition assay between MtsA and EGTA, showed an exponential decrease in the absorbance at 365 nm with a half-time of ca. 130 min, indicative of a gradual release of iron from MtsA (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information). A pseudo-first-order kinetics equation gave a satisfactory fit to the curve and an iron release rate constant k of 0.005 min-1. The release rate increased when more EGTA was added to the reaction solution, and the rate constants with respect to EGTA concentration could be appropriately fitted to a Hill plot (Figure S3 of the Supporting Information), indicating that release of iron from WT-MtsA followed a saturation mode of kinetics. Similar kinetics were shown by the mutant proteins (Table 3). Iron release rates were found to increase in the following order: WT-MtsA (0.005 min-1) < E206A (0.014 min-1) , D281A (0.101 min-1) < H68A (0.192 min-1) < H140A (0.610 min-1) < tetra mutant (0.826 min-1), reciprocally consistent with the Fe2+ binding affinities. DISCUSSION The MtsA protein has superficial structural similarities with the eukaryotic iron-binding proteins, transferrin and lactoferrin (34), and their bacterial analogues, the periplasmic ironbinding proteins of Gram-negative bacteria (35-37). All of these proteins share the property that the metal ion is bound between two domains, to ligands that are contributed from both domains. This means that relative domain movements can be coupled to metal ion release. There are significant differences, however, that reflect the different family to which MtsA belongs and its different physiological function. First, in MtsA, as in other members of the MBR family, the metal site is much closer to the protein surface than in the transferrins, and an R-helix spanning the two domains ensures that no large conformational change accompanies metal ion release. This contrasts with the transferrins and their bacterial analogues, in which -strands link the two domains and allow large-scale domain movements (36). Second, the binding site in MtsA favors the binding of divalent metal ions, compared with the trivalent preference of the transferrins, and this is achieved by the choice of ligands: two neutral His

residues and two carboxylates for MtsA (overall 2- charge) compared with one His, one carboxylate, and two tyrosinates for transferrins (34) (overall 3- charge). The use of tyrosine ligands in particular appears to give a high affinity for iron (typically 1020 M-1), as is shown for both the transferrins and their bacterial analogues. This is consistent also with the use of catecholate ligands in many bacterial siderophores (38). In contrast, metal ion affinities are lower in the MBRs, they have less specific ligand sets, and they have more promiscuous metal binding roles. The absence of bicarbonate from the Fe2+ coordination sphere in MtsA was unexpected, given the NMR evidence for direct coordination of the anion (11). The ligand movements seen in ZnuA (28), however, suggest that the two outer ligands, His68 and Glu206, may be similarly "flipped" out in the metal-free form of MtsA. Bicarbonate may then be bound to the Fe2+ ion in the initial stages of binding, to be replaced by Glu206 as closure around the metal ion is completed. The failure of ions such as citrate to fill the same role may be explained by the relatively low affinity of MtsA for Fe2+, since stronger chelating ions might not be displaced. The specificity for Fe2+ over Fe3+ in MtsA is consistent with the presence of only two negatively charged ligands in the coordination sphere and the lack of room for solvent or coordinating anions. It contrasts with the transferrins in which Fe3+ is strongly preferred and carbonate is incorporated in the primary coordination sphere (34). Selective mutation of each of the ligands in the primary metal binding site of MtsA clearly points to differences in their roles in the binding site. Mutations of three of the ligands, His68, His140, and Asp281, in each case substantially decreased Fe2+ binding affinities and dramatically accelerated the release of iron from the mutant proteins. On the other hand, elimination of the fourth ligand, Glu206, had only minor effects on iron binding and release (Table 2). In addition, ICP-MS measurements revealed that the E206A mutant protein binds iron stably with 1:1 stoichiometry, similar to that of WT-MtsA. This suggests that Glu206 may not be essential for iron binding in MtsA. This ligand could be replaced by bicarbonate in the E206A protein, since the binding assays were conducted in 10 M NaHCO3, or by other buffer ions. Alternatively, an adjacent residue, Asn227, could substitute for it in the coordination sphere (Figure 2). By taking a different rotamer, this residue can extend its O1 atom to ° within 2.8 A of the Fe2+ ion. A concomitant small movement of the metal ion would enable stable binding. Of the other ligands, mutation of His140 has the most dramatic effect on iron binding; apart from the tetra mutant, the H140A has the lowest iron binding constant, the fastest iron release rate, and the lowest iron content in ICP-MS determination. This can be explained by the fact that His140 is the most deeply buried ligand and makes a strong hydrogen bond with Asp138 O1 (Figure 2). It thus contributes not only to iron coordination but also to the stability and spatial organization of

Article the whole binding site. His140 is fully conserved in all MBR sequences, and we conclude, as may be also inferred from studies with ZnuA (28), that this ligand acts as an anchor for the metal binding site. Intriguingly, the tetra mutant still held some iron binding ability. This points to the likely existence of one or more secondary metal binding sites in MtsA, such as has already been found in the zinc-binding ZnuA (32). Two possible sites are ° apparent from the MtsA structure. The first is 4.5 A from the primary iron-binding site, where two water molecules, OW112 and OW113, occupy a small cavity (Figure 2) bounded by Glu206 and Asp281 (both iron ligands) together with Cys208, Asn227, Glu255, and Ser257. In the absence of the primary ligands, this site would be readily accessible to a metal ion. The presence of Cys208 at this site is intriguing as it may explain the fact that MtsA binds both Zn2+ and Cu2+ in a 2:1 ratio (11); both these metal ions would be attracted to the "soft" sulfur ligand. Another interesting possibility is on the MtsA surface where Tyr222 is equivalent to His224 in ZnuA. The latter provides a second binding site for zinc in ZnuA (32), and Tyr222 could contribute to secondary iron binding by MtsA, given its affinity for Fe3+. Again, buffer ions could also participate in any secondary or nonspecific binding. The structural and functional data presented here and previously (11) show that the primary specificity of MtsA in vitro is for Fe2+. The likely physiological role of MtsA is a more subtle question, however. As a human hemolytic pathogen causing acute inflammatory infections, S. pyogenes is likely to be exposed to low levels of free iron, but much higher levels of heme, released from hemoproteins. Its main source of iron may thus be through the analogous heme transporter, HtsA (7). Studies on the regulation of MtsA expression show that levels of MtsA are depressed by added Fe3+ and Mn2+, but not Zn2+, and that the effects are most dramatic with Mn2+ (14). This implies a role in both iron and manganese homeostasis in vivo, even though its in vitro binding ability favors iron. It is also noteworthy that although there is strong similarity in the metal binding site through all MBRs, MtsA does not seem to have an in vivo role in zinc homeostasis, which is instead controlled by another MBR member, Lsp, in S. pyogenes (39).
