Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a recently recognized pathogen of dogs that is similar to the long-recognized feline, mink, and raccoon parvoviruses. Relationships between the viruses determined from DNA sequences of the capsid protein genes of 10 virus isolates showed the CPV isolates to be closely related to the other viruses, although comprising a distinct group. No immediate ancestor of CPV was observed amongst the mink, cat, or raccoon viruses examined. Three different directly repeated sequences were present within the noncoding region downstream from the capsid between CPV and feline panleukopenia virus at restriction sites within the protein genes. Analysis of recombinants capsid protein genes mapped a CPV-specific neutralization epitope on the virus capsid. differences in the pH dependence of hemagglutination, and part of the determinant of canine host range between 59 and 64 genome map units (m.u.). Those differences were therefore the result of up to three nucleotide or predicted amino acid sequence differences in that region. A second region between 64 and 73 m.u., which may affect the viability of certain recombinant o 1988Academic PWSS, IN. viruses, contained four nucleotide differences, one of which was a coding change.

INTRODUCTION Animal viruses have defined natural host ranges and the sudden emergence of a virus as a new pathogen of an animal group is an unusual event. Canine parvovirus type-2 (CPV) was first recognized during 1978 as the cause of a panzootic of disease in domestic and wild canids in several countries (Appel et al,, 1979a; Kelly, 1978: Burtonboy ef a/., 1979; Johnson and Spradbrow, 1979). CPV appears to have only recently emerged in domestic dogs. Retrospective serological studies revealed the first CPV antibodies in sera collected from domestic dogs in Europe in 1976, in many other areas of the world by 1978 (reviewed by Carmichael and Binn, 1981; Pollock and Parrish, 1985), and in wild coyotes in the United States in 1979 (Thomas eta/., 1984). Between 1979 and 1981 the original CPV type-2 was largely replaced in nature by an antigenically and genetically variant strain, here designated CPV type-2a (Parrish et al., 1985, 1988b). CPV appears unrelated antigenically (Carmichael et a/., 1980), or by restriction enzyme mapping of the viral DNA (Macartney et a/., 1988), to the minute virus of canines (CPV type-l) (Binn et a/., 1970) (the designations CPV type-l and CPV type-2 have not been formally recognized). However, CPV is similar to feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), mink enteritis virus (MEV),

and raccoon parvovirus (RPV) (Appel et a/., 1979b; Johnson and Spradbrow, 1979; McMaster et a/., 1981 b). Reported nucleotide sequences of the VP-l and VP-2 genes of CPV and FPV are >98% homologous (Rhode, 1985; Carlson et al., 1985) and the viruses are closely related, although distinguishable, antigenically when examined with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) (Parrish et al., 1982; Parrish and Carmichael, 1983; Surleraux et a/., 1987). The FPV and CPV also differ in pH dependence of hemagglutination (HA), as CPV isolates HA in buffers with pH values above 7.0, while FPV isolates HA only below that pH (Carmichael et al., 1980; Moraillon and Moraillon, 1982). Diseases associated with FPV and RPV have been known for many years (Waller, 1940; Goss, 1948). Mink viral enteritis was first recognized during 1947 in Canada, and thereafter in many parts of the world (Schofield, 1949; Wills, 1952; reviewed by Burger and Gorham, 1970). Reasons for the sudden emergence of minkviral enteritis in the 1940s have not been revealed, and it is not known whether MEV gained the host range for mink at that time or whether the virus had long been infecting mink. Analysis of viral capsids with mAb revealed three antigenic types of MEV, an'd also differences between RPV and FPV strains. Both CPV- and FPV-specific epitopes were present, as well as antigenic differences between CPV and CPV type-2a (Parrish and Carmichael, 1983; Parrish et a/., 1984, 1985; Surleraux et

a/., 1987). Studies of recombinants between CPV and CPV-102110, an antigenic and host range mutant derived by in v&o passage, revealed that both differences were associated with the same mutations around 72 genome map units (mu.), within the VP-l/VP-2 gene (Parrish and Carmichael, 1986). Autonomous parvoviruses encapsidate about 5000 bases of single-stranded DNA, encode genes for two structural and one or more nonstructural proteins, and have palindromic termini required for DNA replication (reviewed by Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987). The capsid proteins (VP-l and VP-2) are translated from alternatively spliced overlapping messenger RNAs encoded between 39 and about 93 mu., and have much of their primary sequence in common (Pintel et a/., 1983; Rhode and Paradiso, 1983; Rhode, 1985; Labieniec-Pintel and Pintel, 1986; Morgan and Ward, 1986). The 22-nm parvovirus capsid comprises about 10 copies of VP-l and 60 copies of VP-2 (Tattersall et a/., 1977; Wobbe et a/., 1984) that may be arranged as homo- and heterodimers (Paradiso, 1983), although the precise capsid structure is unknown. CPV has the properties of an autonomous parvovirus (Paradiso et al., 1982). Here we examine the relationships between CPV, CPV type-2a, FPV, RPV, and MEV isolates by comparing sequences of their VP-l and VP-2 genes (approximately 45% of the virus genome). Analysis of recombinants prepared in vitro between CPV and FPV allowed the definition of differences in the VP-l/VP-2 gene

affecting host range for dogs, pH dependence of HA, and a CPV-specific epitope. METHODS Cell cultures and viruses FPV, MEV, and RPV isolates were grown in NLFK feline cells (derived from the Crandell feline kidney cell line (Crandell et al., 1973) and CPV isolates were grown either in NLFK cells or in the A72 canine fibromaderived cell line (Binn et al., 1980). Virus isolates examined have been previously described, and are listed in Table 1. Viruses were not end-point cloned, but were passaged as few times as possible in tissue culture before replicative-form (RF) DNA was prepared. Viral DNA preparation, cloning, and sequencing Cells seeded at 1.5-2 X 104/cm2 were inoculated with virus and incubated at 37" until viral cytopathic effect was observed. Cells were lysed and viral RF DNA was recovered using a modification of the Hirt procedure (McMaster et al., 1981 a). The monomer-RF DNA was then purified by electrophoresis and recovered from low-melting-temperature (LMT) agarose gels (Weislander, 1979). The Taql to Pstl (44-59 m.u.), HindIll to Haelll (47.5-74 m.u.), and Haelll (C) (74-95 or 97 m.u.) fragments (McMaster et al,, 1981 b) were cloned into the Ml3 phage vectors mp8, mp18, or mpl9 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985) (Fig. 1).

(44-59 m.u.) clones were used to sequence the beginning of the VP-l gene of the CPV isolates, FPV-b and MEV-d. MEV-a, RPV-a, and FPV-a were sequenced only from the HindIll site at 47.5 m.u. Subclones prepared after Sspl digestion of a Haelll (C) clone of each virus allowed sequencing of the noncoding regions up to 95 m.u. (Fig. 1). Sequencing reactions were initiated with either the 15- or 17-base Ml 3 universal primers, or with one of nine different 12-base primers complementary to sequences in the viral VP-l and VP-2 genes (TCTTCGCTCTGG, GTGGGGAT-I-TCT, CACCT-TGGTCAT, ACTCCAGCAGCT, GTGCCAGTACAC, GAAACACCTGAG, GTCCT'I-TAACTG, GATCCTGATGCA, TATGAAAAATCT). Reactions were labeled with [a-32P]dATP (Sanger et al., 1977; Biggin et al., 1983) and electrophoresed in 6 or 8% acrylamide gels containing 8 M urea with repeated loadings, and then the fixed and dried gels were exposed to film at -70".

or CPV-b (Rhode, 1985). VP-l and VP-2 sequences were translated using previously described start codons and splice donor and acceptor sites (Carlson et a/., 1985; Rhode, 1985). Differences from the sequence of the wild-type isolate CPV-d are listed and diagrammed in Figs. 2 and 3. The relative hydropathy of the VP-l and VP-2 of CPV-d was determined by the method of Kyte and Doolittle (1982) using a seven amino acid window. For the 88-95 m.u. (largely noncoding) region, sequences were aligned with the sequence of FPV-a or with the MEV-d sequence (form 2) for the second copy of the repeat present only in that virus.

Preparation of recombinants between CPV-b and FPV-d
Monomer RF DNA was isolated from infected cells and purified in LMT agarose gels as described above. After digestion with Pstl, Bg/ll, or Pvull, end fragments were purified in LMT agarose gels and then ligated to the opposite end fragment from the othervirus (see Fig. 7). Recombinant DNAs in Tris- or HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.2) were mixed with 10 pg of salmon sperm carrier DNA and transfected into thinly seeded NLFK cells using calcium phosphate precipitation (Graham and van der Eb, 1973) followed after 3 hr by incubation for 1 min with 20% (w/v) glycerol in buffered saline

Analysis of sequences
Sequences of each viral isolate between the proposed VP-l start site (or for MEV-a, RPV-a, and FPV-a from a HindIll site at nucleotide 203 in the VP-l sequence (Fig. 1)) and the end of the VP-l/VP-2 genes at 89 m.u. were compared to each other and to the published sequences of FPV-Carl (Carlson eta/., 1985)

combinants. Hemagglutination titers for rhesus macaque erythrocytes were determined in barbital-acetate buffers with pH values between 5.8 and 7.4. Analysis of canine host range

The host ranges of the viruses were determined in tissue culture by infection of A72 or NLFK cells with 0.06 PFU per cell (as determined in NLFK cells) of each of the parental or recombinant viruses. The viral HA in the culture supernatant was determined each day after infection.

To determine the host range for dogs, g-to 12-weekold specific-pathogen-free (SPF) dogs were held under approved containment conditions. In separate experiments dogs were each inoculated intramuscularly with between 1 X 1O4 and 8 X 1O4 PFU of various viruses, as detailed in Table 3. Samples of thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, and ileum were collected on the fourth day postinoculation, prepared as 1: 10 (w/v) suspensions in Eagle's minimum essential medium, and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 gfor 10 min. Viral titers were determined using a radioimmune plaque titration assay in feline NLFK cells, as previously described (Lemon et al., 1983; Parrish et al., 1986).

RESULTS DNA sequence analysis By combining the sequences obtained using the custom primers with those derived using the universal primers sequences between 45 and 95 m.u. of five viruses were obtained. MEV-a, RPV-a, and FPV-a were sequenced only from a HindIll site at 47.5 m.u. All viruses were >98% homologous to CPV-d in nucleotide and amino acid sequences in the nonduplicated regions between 45 or 47.5 and 89 m.u., indicating a considerable sequence conservation between the viruses of mink, cats, raccoons, and dogs over the past two decades.

Capsid protein gene sequences The CPV-d was used for comparison because that 1979 isolate had been passaged only five times in A72 cells, and the translated VP-lNP-2 gene sequence is shown in Fig. 1. Sequence positions in the VP-lNP-2 genes which differed between any of the viruses, and the predicted amino acid sequence substitutions, are shown in Fig. 2. Twenty-five of the fifty-one differences in the region sequenced in all 10 viruses (nt 203-2256) were observed in only a single virus, while some others could be identified with particular virus types and differentiated either CPV isolates from FPV, MEV, and RPV isolates, or CPV type-2a isolates (CPV-15 and CPV-31)

Numbers along the branches indicate the number of nucleotide substitutions between nodes.

from the other viruses (Figs. 2 and 3). The distribution of nucleotide, amino acid, and nonconservative amino acid differences within the VP-l and VP-2 genes is shown in Fig. 3. Phylogenetic relationships between the viruses were determined by analysis of the differences between the sequences determined for all 10 viruses (Fig. 2) and an unrooted network of the sequence relationships between the viruses was derived assuming maximum parsimony (Fitch, 1977; Aquadro and Greenberg, 1983) (Fig. 4). A total of 55 substitutions at the 51 variable sites was required to relate all 10 sequences. Only 2 sites required parallel/convergent (repeated) substitutions. No clustering was apparent for the 3 sites showing multiple/repeated substitutions, indicating that interviral recombination within this region has not played a role in the evolution of this group. Several other networks with 55 substitutions exist which differ only in the arrangement of the non-CPV viruses with relation to each other, due to the small number of substitutions separating the basal nodes of that group. The distribution of sequence differences is shown in Fig. 3. Twelve nucleotide (nt) and five amino acid sequence differences within the VP-l unique region were found mostly in single virus isolates. A difference at nt 97 was within the predicted intron in the VP-l, and a CPV-specific difference at position 342 was a silent substitution. The four sequence differences between the amino terminus of the VP-2 gene (nt 502) and nt 739 were silent base changes, but there were five coding and three silent differences between nts 740 and 843. Of those, four (nts 740, 747, 780, and 809) were CPV specific, while two others (nts 760 and 803) differed between the pre-1980 CPV isolates (CPV-d and CPV-b) and the CPV type-2a viruses (CPV-15 and CPV-31). Five of seven differences between nt 844 and 1399 were silent substitutions, and one (nt 1200) was CPV specific.

Three different bases were observed at nt position 1400-giving alanine in CPV-d, CPV-b, MEV-a, and the FPV isolates, valine in MEV-d, and glycine in the two CPV type-2a isolates. Of eight differences between nts 1401 and 1668, three were specific for CPV isolates, two of which changed the coding sequence, and there was a CPV type-2a-specific coding difference at nt 1414. Nucleotide 1624 coded for an Asn in FPV, RPV, MEV, and CPV type-2a isolates, and an Asp in the pre1980 CPV isolates. Of 10 nt sequence differences between positions 1669 and 2 124 only 3 gave differences in amino acid sequence, all in single viruses. Four amino acid sequence differences were observed near the carboxy terminus of the proteins, and one of these (nt 2164) was specific for CPV type-2a isolates, while two (nts 2192 and 2204) were CPV specific. Duplicated and noncoding region sequences Sequences of the genome from position 2230 in the CPV-d sequence in Fig. 1 to the Haelll site at 95 m.u. in the CPV isolates were compared and are presented in Fig. 5. Those sequences included single base differences and variation of a series of 50- to 65-base directly repeated sequences which were present in varying numbers and combinations in the various viruses, and which are diagrammed in Fig. 6. Recombinant viruses Three types of single recombinant between CPV-d and FPV-b were prepared in vitro at the WI, Bglll or Pvull sites (Fig. 7). Two types of double recombinant were prepared by recombining single recombinants at second restriction sites (Fig. 7). Recombinants were confirmed by analysis of viral RF DNAs after restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 8), and Recs 1a, 1b, 3b, 4, 5a, and 5b were further characterized by DNA sequencing (Table 2). Analysis of the viruses with mAbs revealed that a difference affecting the CPV-specific epitope detected by mAbs 7, 11, 25, and 14 was encoded between 59 and 64 m.u., as only that region differed between Recs 1a or 1b and Recs 3a or 3b. That epitope was also present on Recs 4, 5a, and 5b (Fig. 7). The difference in pH dependence of HA between FPV-b and CPV-d is shown in Fig. 9, and the ability of CPV to HA at pH 7.0 was also encoded between 59 and 64 m.u. in the genome (Fig. 7). To further define the properties of the 59-64 m.u. region, attempts were made to prepare recombinants containing only that region from CPV-d, with the remainder of the genome from FPV-b. In seven attempts only Ret 4 was isolated, and that virus replicated to low

FIG. 5. Sequences of the 88-95 m.u. regions of the viruses which contain up to three directly repeated units. Two forms (1 and 2) of that region from MEV-d are shown. The sequence shown starts at position 2230 (Fig. 1) within the coding region of VP-l and VP-2 and extends to the position of the Haelll site at 95 m.u. in the CPV isolates. The sequence given in the top line is derived primarily from FPV-a, except for the second copies of repeats (2) and (3) which are derived from FPV-Carl and MEV-d (form 2) respectively, as they were present only in those viruses. Dashes indicate homology with the listed sequence, while gaps indicate deletions compared to one or more of the other sequences. The boundaries of the repeats were chosen as the positions where copies were added or deleted, and the general structure of the repeat units is indicated above the sequence.

nine host ranges the ability of the recombinant viruses to replicate in dogs was examined. Virus titers in the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, and ileum of SPF dogs were determined 4 days after inoculation, as detailed in Table 3. Recombinants 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b all replicated in A72 cells in culture and in dogs, while Recs 1a, 1b, and 2 did not. This indicated that the canine host range function was encoded between 59 and 73 m.u. At least part of the host range function was encoded between 59 and 64 m.u., as Recs 3a and 3b differed from Recs 1a and 1b only in that region. DISCUSSION

phylogenetic analysis also suggested that the two CPV types diverged from some common ancestor before 1978, indicating that CPV type-2 was initially successful, but that around 1979 or 1980 there was a global replacement by CPV type-2a in nature (Parrish et a/., 1985, 1988b). No reasons for this replacement have yet been revealed. A recently reported sequence of a CPV not included in this analysis showed that virus to differ from CPV-d at only three positions in the VP-l/VP-2 gene-at nts 1600 (G-T, Asp-Tyr), 1624 (A-G, Asn-Asp), and 1776 (A-G). That virus has the seqence expected for a pre1980 type of CPV (Reed et a/., 1988). The origins of CPV are poorly understood. No evidence for its presence in domestic or wild dogs prior to late 1976 has been presented (reviewed by Pollock and Parrish, 1985). A source from some isolated population of canids seems unlikely as both CPV type-2 and CPV type-2a spread worldwide within a few years of their first emergence (Parrish et al., 1988b). The results shown in Fig. 4 suggest that an ancestor of CPV could have derived from an FPV, RPV, or MEV strain which has not yet been identified. The events that selected for CPV are unknown. Canine parvovirus isolates replicate poorly in cats, raccoons, or mink (Appel and Parrish,

Note. Virus titers in various tissues of dogs 4 days after intramuscular inoculation with 2-8 X 1O4 PFU of FPV-b, CPV-d, or recombinants, except for Ret 4 (Experiment 1) of which 1 X lo4 PFU was inoculated. Ret 4 virus (4 X 1 O4 PFU) recovered from the thymus of the dog in Experiment 1 was used to inoculate each of the dogs in Ret 4, Experiment 2. In Ret 4, Experiment 3, 8 x 10" PFU of Ret 4 derived from tissue culture was inoculated.

Comparisons of the DNA sequences of most of the VP-l gene and the entire VP-Z gene of 10 viruses showed that the FPV, MEV, and RPV isolates were all closely related phylogenetically and could not be readily distinguished. Other studies of the antigenic and biological relationships between FPV, RPV, and MEV have also suggested that those viruses are very closely related, and that FPV and RPV differ from MEV isolates primarily in their virulence for mink (Barker et al., 1983; Parrish and Carmichael, 1983; Parrish et a/., 1987). In the phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 4) the CPV isolates formed a separate cluster which was further subdivided into the original CPV type-2 and the more recently recognized CPV type-2a which have previously been defined by antigenic analysis with mAb and by restriction enzyme analysis (Parrish et a/., 1985).

1982; Barker et a/., 1983; Parrish et al., 1987) while FPV isolates replicate inefficiently in dogs (Table 3). All viruses replicate in certain cultured cat cells in vitro (Fig. 10) (Appel et al., 1979a, b; Tratschin et al., 1982). Previous analyses comparing restriction enzyme maps of viral RF DNAs from a number of FPV, MEV, and pre-1980 CPV isolates suggested that certain vaccine strains of FPV had two or three variable Hinfl sites in common with the CPV isolates examined (Tratschin et a/., 1982). However, the two FPV vaccine viruses which were most similar to CPV in that analysis (Philips-Roxane vaccine (FPV-a) and Dellen vaccine strain (FPV-Carl)) did not appear any more similar to the CPV isolates from the analysis of the VPlA/P2 sequences (Fig. 4) indicating that they are probably not direct ancestors of CPV. The nucleotide sequence differences were distributed throughout the VP-l/VP-2 genes, but there was a certain amount of clustering of the coding differences (Fig. 3). Amino acid sequence differences were spread throughout the VP-l unique portion of the protein, but within the VP-l/VP-2 common portion there were several changes around nt 800, between nts 1400 and 1768, and near the carboxy-terminal end of the proteins (Fig. 3). Analysis of recombinants between CPV-d and FPV-b showed that the CPV-specific antigenie site, the pH dependence of HA, and at least part of the canine host range of CPV-d mapped between nts 770 and 1080 (59 and 64 m.u.) (Figs. 7 and 10, Table 3). Those differences were therefore determined by one or more of the three amino acid sequence differences in that region (Fig. 2, Table 2) indicating that the sequence variation around 60 m.u. defined an important functional region on the virus capsid. Studies of a mutant of CPV which lost the ability to HA at any pH between 6.0 and 7.4 after passage in NLFK cells have shown differences in the sequence of the VP-l/ VP-2 gene only at nts 1631 and 2 185, indicating that two or more areas of the capsid protein affect different aspects of patvovirus HA (Parrish et al., 1988a). It proved difficult to isolate the 59-64 m.u. region of CPV-d in an FPV-b background. The only virus derived was Ret 4 which both had mutated to the CPV sequence at nt 1468 and had a second mutation at nt 1195. This suggests that viruses with the 59-64 m.u. region from CPV but with the 64-73 m.u. region from FPV may not be viable. Recombinant 4 replicated inefficiently in the A72 canine cell line (Fig. lo), and when inoculated into dogs on a number of occasions the virus replicated only in the thymus of an occasional animal (Table 3). Whether this inefficient replication was the result of the mutation at nt 1195 in Ret 4 was not determined. Ret 5b that grew efficiently in canine cells

and dogs (Fig. 10, Table 3) was prepared from the 73100 m.u. fragment of Ret 4 (Fig. 7); therefore the change in Ret 4 affecting the host range was not within that region. The codon at nt 1195 also coded for a valine in MEV-a and RPV-b (Fig. 2), although it is not known whether that change affects the functions of those viruses. A similar restriction has been reported in the analysis of two minute virus of mice (MVM), MVM(p), and MVM(i). A recombinant virus containing the 69-85 m.u. region of MVM(p) in an MVM(i) background was able to replicate in fibroblasts, but the reciprocal virus (the 69-85 m.u. region of MVM(i) in an MVM(p) background) did not grow in lymphocytes (Antonietti et al., 1988). The 64-73 m.u. region encodes an important virus type-common neutralizing epitope, and also affects the host range. Studies of recombinants between CPV mutant 102/l 0 (CPV-102/10) and CPV-d mapped mutation(s) affecting canine host range and a common antigenie site to nts 1397 and/or 1400 (Parrish and Carmichael, 1986). Viruses MEV-d and CPV-15 or CPV-31 also differ antigenically from CPV-d or CPV-b, MEV-a and RPV-a (Parrish and Carmichael, 1983; Parrish et al., 1985) and all differed from CPV-d at nt 1400. As MEV-d differed from MEV-a in predicted amino acid sequence only at nt 1400 in the sequences examined, that position most likely determines the antigenic differences between those viruses. The mechanism(s) of host range restriction of the viruses was not examined here. The region around 60 mu. is probably exposed on the surface of the viral capsid, as it encodes both a neutralizing antigenic site and a site affecting the pH dependence of HA. The structure of the 64-73 m.u. region was not as clearly defined here. However, as mutations affecting host range of CPV-102/10 at 72 m.u. were associated with a neutralizing antigenic site, that region must also be on the surface of the virus capsid. It is not known whether the functional differences between CPV and FPV affect the binding to specific receptors or complex interactions between viral infectivity and transcription in differentiated cells, such as have been described for the variant viruses MVM(i) and MVM(p) (Tattersall and Bratton, 1983; Spalholz and Tattersall, 1983; Ron eta/., 1984; Ron and Tal, 1986). There were also a number of differences in nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the 70-74 m.u. region of MVM(i) and MVM(p) (Astell et a/., 1986; Sahli et a/., 1986). The ability of MVM(p) to replicate in fibroblasts also mapped between 69 and 85 m.u. (Antonietti et a/., 1988). The presence of directly repeated sequences in the noncoding region downstream from the capsid protein gene has been reported for a number of parvoviruses

(Rhode, 1978, 1985; Carlson, 1985; Astell et al., 1986; reviewed by Cotmore and Tattersall, 1987). The sequences reported here revealed three different repeated sequences between 89 and 95 m.u. (Figs. 5 and 6). All viruses contained at least one copy of each of the three repeats and the conservation of sequence between the first copy of each repeat was >92%, and some areas were highly conserved-for example, there were no differences in nucleotide sequence of repeat 2. No function has yet been assigned to that region of the viral genome, although it has been suggested that some sequences in MVM have similarities enhancer sequences (Astell et al., to transcriptional 1986). The MEV-d stock examined contained two genomic forms with either one or two copies of repeat 3, which may have been derived during the unknown number of passages of that virus in tissue culture. The duplications of the sequences were not virus type-specific. CPV-31 and CPV-15 varied by only one base in the VP-l/VP-2 gene, yet had one or two copies of repeat 1, respectively. As those viruses had been isolated from diagnostic specimens and passaged in tissue culture fewer than five times before preparing RF DNA for sequencing that difference must have been present amongst the virulent viruses in nature. The 22-nm parvovirus capsid contains about 60 copies of VP-2 and 8-l 0 copies of VP-l (Tattersall et al., 1977; Wobbe et a/., 1984), and crosslinking studies of the H-l virus capsid suggest that the proteins are present in the capsid as hetero- and homodimers (Paradiso, 1983). From the size of the capsid and of each protein subunit, only a small portion of each VP-1 or VP-2 molecule would be exposed on the outside of the capsid. These studies and the analysis of the CPV-102/10 mutant show that variable regions around 59-62 and 6874 m.u. contain two of the neutralizing epitopes of the virus capsid, and therefore are most likely exposed on the surface of the virus capsid. Studies of H-l virus revealed proteolytic cleavage of one or both arginines in DNA containing (full) capsids, at nt 548 or 557 in CPVd (Fig. 1). Therefore that region also must be exposed on the surface of full capsids (Paradiso et al., 1984). No function has yet been associated with the variant sequences near the carboxy terminus of the proteins, although one of two variant amino acids in the non-HA CPV was at nt 2185 (Parrish et al., 1988a). The coincidence of variable sequences, exposed epitopes, and functional regions of viral structural proteins has been observed in analysis of other viruses, where the variable and antigenic regions are often found to be located on flexible external loops in the protein structures (Wiley et a/., 1981; Colman et a/., 1983; Hogle et a/., 1985; Rossman et al., 1985, Sherry et a/.,

1986). If this is true for parvoviruses then the 59-62 and 68-74 m.u. regions, and perhaps the carboxy terminus, comprise exposed loops on the surface of the capsid. These results indicate that only a few differences within the capsid protein gene can endow FPV with the host range, antigenic type, and HA properties of CPV, as defined in this study. While we do not know that those differences are all that are required to turn FPV into a successful canine pathogen, it appears that CPV could have derived from one of the other viruses by only a small number appropriate changes. Further studies are aimed at determining the mechanisms by which the differences defined determine the host range, and also the differences between the pre-1980 CPV type-2 and the post-l 980 CPV type-2a which resulted in a global change in viral type only a few years after the first emergence of CPV.
