cases the corresponding pyrazolo/3,4_d/pyridazines are the major, if not 2-8 the only products , and their structures have been in some instances 9,lO confirmed by X-ray analyses . According to this, we decided to reinvestigate the reaction mentioned above in order to find the reaction conditions for formation of pyrazolo/3,4_d/pyridazine derivative g. We repeated the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of 2-diazopropane 2-methyl-6-phenylpyridazin_3(2H)-one (2) to (1) under esentially the same con-

ditions as described in lit.', and found that the same products are formed. However, in different solvents and at various temperatures the distribution of the products was strongly dependent on the solvent. The primary cycloadduct (2) could be isolated In analytically pure form at temperatures below O°C due to its relatively low solubility in diethyl ether. At room temperature, the secondary reactions were observed in which 2 transformed in three different ways. In the presence of an acid, the isomerization of - Into NH,NH-dihydro species 4 took place, dehydrogenation (oxi3 dation) in the presence of oxygen from the air produced 3H-pyrazolo/3,4-d/ pyridazine derivative a, while elimination of a molecule of nitrogen from
the pyrazole part of the molecule, followed by rearrangement, gave a mlx-

ture of 2, 5 and - This latter transformation was carried out in diffe7. rent solvents at 18oC under essentially the same reaction conditions. In more polar solvents, such as DMF, methanol
and ethanol,

In the presence of

air - was dehydrogenated quantitatively into 8, in propanol a mixture of 3 4 8 - and - was formed, while in less polar solvents the yields of 2, 5, and 1 were increased. In hydroxylic solvents also some starting material was recovered unchanged due to faster decomposition of 2-diazopropane (1). For example, in methanol 2-diazopropane was decomposed in 10 minutes. At 18OC the reactions were finished in 70 - 85 minutes, while at -3OOC in diethyl ether the reaction was finished in 24 hours. The formation and ratios among products are summarized in Table 1. According to these experiments 4 was isolated in analytically pure form from acetone in 54 % yield, while 8 - was the only product in DMF. Both dihydro intermediates - and 4 are thermally unstable.

benzene, toluene and dioxane, 2 was the main product, in more polar solvents, such as DMF and DMSO, 5 was the major product, while the formation of - was in thermal transformations always only the minor product. 1,27 Dihydro derivative 2 thermally more stable. It can be purified by crystallization. However, by heating in DMF elimination of methane, which was observed, when the reaction was followed by 'H nmr technique, took place to afford 9. Oxidation of 2 and 4 could be achieved with a variety of oxidizing agents, such as oxygen from air and bromine. The simplest method is oxidation by air in the presence of a base. Under these conditions the transformation is practically quantitative to give 2 as the only product. On the other hand, catalytic hydrogenation of - over Pd/C produced 2 as the 8 only dihydro product. When 8 was heated in PPA or in concentrated sulfuric acid at 100°C, the 1,5-sigmatropic rearrangement of one of the methyl groups was observed. In PPA two products - and - were isolated In 41 % and 43 % yield, res10 11 10 13 pectively. In concentrated sulfuric acid - and - were formed in 12 % and 88 % yield, respectively. The compounds - and - are formed in 1,5-sigma10 11 tropic rearrangements of one of the methyl groups taking place either in clockwise or antlclockwise direction around the pyrazole part of the molecule, analogous to the rearrangement observed In the 3H-pyrazole 13 seriesll. The formation of - can be explained in the following way. Na11 mely, the compound - can be regarded as a cyclic hydrazide-hydrazone, which is hydrolyzed to give the intermediate g, followed by decarboxylation to give 13, the structure of which was confirmed by an independent synthesis from 15. In these processes only one i.e. 2, of the two possible N-methyl substituted Isomers is formed. The structure of this compound was determined in the following manner. Methylatlon of 9 with DMPDMA gave a 1 14 mixture of - and -* The phenyl group of - appears in the H nmr spec14 10 trum as a broad singlet at & = 7.44 ppm, due to the steric hindrance, while the phenyl group in - shows two multiplets at 6 = 7.20 - 7.50 ppm and 6 = 10 8.10-8.35 ppm, indicating the coplanarity of the phenyl group with the rest of the molecule. This is further supported by coupling constants in 13C = 14 nmr spectra. Namely, the C7a in _ appears as a quartet, Jc 7aBN10CH3 7.0 Hz, while for the C7a in e only a singlet was observed. Since the bicyclic pyrazolo/3,4-d/pyridazine derivative 8 in a new compound isolated in this reaction, its structure was confirmed by X-ray analysis (Fig. 1, Table 6). Since this compound Is formed from the cycloadducts 3 or 4, their structures must be as shown on the Scheme 1, and 6 7 consequently, it confirms also the structures of 2, _ and _.

MoXa

radiation (A = 0.71069 R) were used. Precise unit-cell dimension

were obtained by least squares from the 0 values of 104 moderately highorder reflections centered with diffractometer in the range 10°*9<1So using MoXal value X = 0.70926 A at 293(l) X. Integrated intensities were measured in the reciprocal hemisphere kc0 up to emax 25O. Crystal stability was monitored by periodically measuring three standard reflections every 240 reflections; there was no evidence of crystal deterioration. The space group was determined from systematic absences. o(I) based on counting statistics, intensities greater than 2.5 a(1) were considered as observed. A summary of the crystaldata and data collection parameters is given in Table 3. Intensities were corrected for background and change in the standards, and converted to structure amplitudes after applying Lorentz and polarization corrections. No absorption correction was made. The structure was solved in a routine way by direct method with MULTAN80? E map with the highest combined figure of merit, using 232 phase (IE1>1.20) resulted in initial coordinates for all nonhydrogen atoms. Positions of hydrogen atoms were partly calculated partly were got atoms were taken from from difference map.

A full-matrix least squares refinement with anisotropic temperature factors for nonhydrogen atoms and isotropic ones for hydrogen atoms using empirical weighting function proceeded to R = 0.045. A summary of refinement parameters is presented in Table 4. All calculations were performed on the DEC-10 computer at RCU 20 system of crystallographic programs.
