Abstract Elongation factor G (EF-G) is a G protein factor that catalyzes the translocation step in protein synthesis on the ribosome. Its GTP conformation in the absence of the ribosome is currently unknown. We present the structure of a mutant EF-G (T84A) in complex with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GDPNP. The crystal structure provides a first insight into conformational changes induced in EF-G by GTP. Comparison of this structure with that of EF-G in complex with GDP suggests that the GTP and GDP conformations in solution are very similar and that the major contribution to the active GTPase conformation, which is quite different, therefore comes from its interaction with the ribosome. ” 2005 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Elongation factors Tu and G (EF-Tu and EF-G) are the catalysts in the elongation phase of bacterial protein biosynthesis. They interact alternately with the ribosome [1,2]. EF-Tu:GTP delivers an aminoacyl tRNA (aa-tRNA) to the aminoacyl site (A-site). After ribosome-catalysed peptide bond formation, EF-G in complex with GTP catalyses the translocation step, in which the peptidyl-tRNA carrying the nascent polypeptide in the A-site and the deacylated tRNA in the peptidyl site (P-site) are moved to the P and exit (E) sites, respectively, with concomitant advance of the mRNA by one codon. EF-G in complex with GDP dissociates from the ribosome, which is now ready for next round of elongation. Both EF-G and EF-Tu belong to the GTPase superfamily [3]. The GTPase activity of EF-Tu and EF-G is dramatically enhanced by the ribosome, which is their effector molecule in its post- and pretranslocational states (postT and preT), respectively [4,5]. GTPases undergo guanine nucleotide-dependent conformational changes [6]. While the inactive GDP states of GTPases are structurally divergent, their active GTP states have very similar conformations around the GTP binding site. So far,

only the GDP and apo conformations of EF-G ``off the ribosome'' have been structurally characterized by X-ray crystallography. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments suggest that the overall solution conformation of EF-G in its different states (apo, GDP and GTP) does not change as dramatically as does that of EF-Tu [7]. In contrast, according to cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), EF-G:GTP has a dramatically altered conformation on the ribosome compared to the crystal structures [8≠10]. The structure of the GTP conformation of EF-G off the ribosome is therefore of great interest, as it would reveal how much conformational change is induced by the nucleotide itself and how much by binding to the ribosome. Here we present the crystal structure of the EF-G mutant T84A from Thermus thermophilus in complex with GDPNP, which shows only modest conformational changes relative to the GDP structure. The dramatically different conformation of EFG:GTP seen on the ribosome must therefore be induced by its interactions with the latter. In a previous study we have suggested the possible importance of the ``Ploop lysine'' Lys25 and its interactions for the affinity of the nucleotide [11]. In light of these results, attempts to co-crystallize EF-G with a GTP analogue were undertaken. Trials were made with wild type and both the G16V and T84A mutants with several different GTP analogues, although only the T84A mutant resulted in a structure with GDPNP. The present crystal structure once more suggests that one important conformational change undergone by EF-G upon binding to the ribosome may involve Lys25 and that this may be one important component that discriminates the conformational cycles of EF-G and its eukaryotic counterpart eEF2 from those of other ribosomal GTPases.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization Cloning, expression and purification of T. thermophilus EF-G was performed as previously described [11]. The T84A mutant was crystallized in the presence of 10 mM GDPNP (Sigma“). 5 ll of 100 mM GDPNP was treated with 2 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Amersham) at room temperature for 30 min prior to addition to the protein solution, in order to remove traces of GDP. Crystals grew from hanging drops by vapour diffusion at precipitant conditions identical to those producing T84A:GDP crystals [11]. 4 ll of a 4 mg/ml protein solution was mixed with 4 ll of reservoir solution. The drops were streak-seeded using T84A:GDP at setup. Crystals resulting from these experiments were too small for data collection but were used to streakseed further drops. Crystals were of suitable size for data collection (0.1 ∑ 0.3 ∑ 0.3 mm) after two days. Preparation of the crystals for cryogenic data collection was as previously described [11].

Data collection and structure determination ∞ Diffraction data were collected at 100 K to 2.5 A resolution at beamline I711 of the MAX-II synchrotron, Lund, Sweden. The data were integrated with XDS [12] and further processed with CCP4 programs [13,14]. The structure was solved using the T84A:GDP structure [11] as search model in Molrep [15]. The model was built using XtalView [16] and refined with Refmac5, first using rigid body refinement then atomic refinement [17] with each domain as a separate TLS group [18]. Density was found at the expected nucleotide binding site and GDP was incorporated into the model. As extra density was visible at the supposed c-phosphate site (Fig. 1A), GDP was replaced by

4493 GDPNP. Figures were made using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org). Structural superimpositions were made using SwissPDB Viewer. Radii of gyration were calculated using MOLEMAN2.

3. Results Good quality crystals of T84A:GDPNP appeared after initial streak seeding with fresh T84A:GDP crystals and subsequent optimization by streak seeding with T84A:GDPNP crystals. As for all other EF-G structures the space group is P212121 [11,19≠22]. Interestingly the cell dimensions for T84A:GDPNP differ from those of T84A:GDP by roughly ∞ 16 A in the b-axis (Table 1) and are more similar to those of native EF-G, despite initial seeding from T84A:GDP crystals. Electron density maps clearly show extra density at the c∞ phosphate position, approximately 1.6 A away from the oxygen of the b-phosphate (Fig. 1A). Refining a GDPNP molecule at occupancy of 0.8 leaves no significant positive or negative density around the phosphates in the difference map (Fig. 1B). The position of the c-phosphate group is in agreement with that seen in the GTP analogue complexes of e.g. EF-Tu and IF2/eIF5B [23≠25]. As in several other EF-G structures, switch II is significantly more flexible than the rest of the ∞ molecule, with B-factors in the range 100≠130 A2 for residues ∞ 86≠90 compared to an average of 53 A2 for the whole structure. Gly86 and the side chain of His87 in switch II are not visible in the electron density. Switch I is invisible between residues 43 and 60, and residues 40≠41 and 61≠65 can only be built as poly-alanine. The density for domain III is unclear in many places, as is the case in several other EF-G structures [19,21,22]. 3.1. Domain movements An overall comparison of T84A:GDPNP with other EF-G structures shows that T84A:GDPNP is more similar to the wild-type EF-G:GDP than to T84A:GDP.

∞ is 0.88 A for 578 Ca atoms, while the rmsd for T84A:GDP is ∞ for the same atoms. The differences between this struc2.29 A ture and wild type are, however, striking due to the presence of the GDPNP nucleotide and a Mg2+ ion. There are no major rearrangements in the G domain except for the conformational changes discussed below. All domains move in relation to the G domain compared to T84A:GDP (Fig. 2). 3.2. The P-loop In T84A:GDPNP the Ile21/Asp22 peptide bond has flipped relative to T84A:GDP (Fig. 1) and the carbonyl group of Ile21 is directed towards the b,c-imido group of GDPNP. The distance from the carbonyl oxygen to the imido nitrogen is ∞ 2.5 A. In all structures of EF-G in complex with GDP, the amide group of the Ile21/Asp22 peptide bond interacts with the b-phosphate oxygen atoms [20≠22]. This peptide flip is possibly supporting evidence for the presence of GDPNP; however it is puzzling that such a phenomenon has not previously been observed in the GDPNP complexes of other ribosomal GTPases. One way to check the relevance of this conformational change would be to co-crystallize EF-G with a GTP analogue where this interaction cannot be formed, e.g., GDPCP. The electron density indicates that not all of the peptide bond has flipped, thus an alternative explanation could be that the flipped peptide represents an apo state, since the nucleotide is only around 80% occupied. The resolution of the current structure does not allow reliable modelling of alternative conformations. However in the apo structure (PDB entry 1ELO) [19], the loop containing Ile21 and Asp22 is folded out into the nucleotide binding site. Thus we find such an alternative explanation for the flipped peptide highly unlikely. Our previous structures of the GDP forms of EF-G mutants G16V and T84A highlighted variation in the interactions of the ``P-loop lysine'', Lys25, with switch II, and led us to ask why EF-G and its eukaryotic homologue eEF-2 are the only structurally characterized ribosomal GTPases in which this residue does not interact with the nucleotide [11]. In wild-type EF-G Thr84 in switch II interacts with Lys25 through a hydrogen bond network involving an intermediate water molecule [19,21,22]. In the more compact structure of the H573A

Fig. 3. Comparison of the interactions of Lys25 in the T84A:GDP structure (magenta) and in T84A:GDPNP (cyan). The hydrogen bond between Lys25 and Thr84 seen in wild-type EF-G and mutant H573A is lost in both these structures, but there is a compensatory H-bond to Asp83 in T84A:GDP. This interaction is also lost in T84A:GDPNP.

mutant this interaction is made directly [20]. In the T84A:GDP complex this interaction is missing, but a compensating interaction is made to the side chain of Asp83 [11]. The hydrogen bond is also lost in T84A:GDPNP due to a slightly different conformation of the beginning of switch II, but the compensatory interaction to Asp83 is now also absent (Fig. 3). This probably causes increased flexibility of Lys25, which leads to the side chain only being visible beyond Cc at 2Fo ¿ Fc map contour levels below 0.7r. Nevertheless Lys25 does not interact with the nucleotide. 3.3. Switch II We have previously implicated Phe90 at the tip of switch II in fusidic acid sensitivity in EF-G [11]. Although its mobility in the current structure precludes a detailed analysis of its position, it clearly does not adopt the same side chain conformation as in either wild-type EF-G:GDP or T84A:GDP. While Phe90 packs into the switch II/domain III interface in the latter structure, it points towards domain V in T84A:GDPNP, in the direction of Thr120 from helix CG in the G domain and Arg660, Ser668, Phe669 in domain V (Fig. 4). The overall orientation of Phe90 and the conformation of the tip of switch II are similar to those seen in the G16V:GDP structure [11]. In contrast, in T84A:GDP Phe90 is oriented similarly to wild type:GDP. The exact significance of these differences in switch II conformation is not currently apparent. 3.4. Switch I The backbone of switch I, normally disordered from around residues 39≠66 in EF-G structures, is visible from residue 61 to residue 65 at 2m|Fo| ¿ D|Fc| map contour levels around 0.7r. A similar phenomenon was seen in the mutant G16V:GDP structure [11], but in T84A:GDPNP switch I appears to proceed in a slightly different direction, bringing it closer to the nucleotide. However, no direct contacts are made and, as in G16V:GDP, the switch I conformation does not resemble that in either the GDP or GTP forms of EF-Tu [23,24]. Nevertheless the proximity of switch I to the Mg2+ ion excludes the

4. Discussion We have solved the structure of the T84A mutant of T. thermophilus EF-G in complex with the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GDPNP. The structure shows an overall conformation very similar to that of native EF-G in the apo state or in complex with GDP. No large domain movements are observed. So far the GTP conformation of EF-G has only been visualized on the ribosome. Cryo-EM reconstructions of EF-G trapped by GDPNP on translating ribosomes [9,10,26] reveal large domain movements compared to the crystal structures [19≠22]. It is possible that the T84A:GDPNP structure does not represent the true GTP conformation of EF-G in solution due to crystal contacts; however we consider this unlikely. A strong indicator is that the structure is clearly induced by the presence of the nucleotide, as its ``wild-type-like'' conformation, with concomitant longer unit cell b axis, was produced by seeding with T84A:GDP crystals having a different crystal packing, under conditions identical to those producing T84A:GDP crystals. Many attempts have been made to produce a structure of the GTP conformation of EF-G, both by us and by others. It is thus puzzling at first glance that the T84A mutation, which results in 4-fold lower GDPNP affinity compared to wild type [27], should be the only one to succeed. We currently have no satisfactory explanation for this, but it could be due to small technical differences in the way the crystallization experiments were carried out. In any case, the T84A:GDPNP structure provides evidence that there is little difference between the GDP and GTP conformations of EF-G in the absence of the ribosome, as EF-G is clearly capable of binding the GTP analogue without this inducing major conformational changes.

This is in agreement with experiments using small angle Xray scattering (SAXS) that demonstrated very little difference in the radius of gyration of EF-G between the GDP and GTP states [7]. Interestingly the calculated radii of gyration of the ``open'' conformation of EF-G seen in the GDPNP ∞ complex (31.9 A) and that of the more compact conformation ∞ in mutants H573A, T84A:GDP and G16V:GDP (30.5 A) are much more similar among themselves than they are to that ∞ of EF-G:GDPNP on the ribosome (34.8 A).1 Experiments with 2-propanol, which stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of E. coli EF-G in solution, show changes in ellipticity indicating tertiary structural changes which may correspond to domain rearrangement [28]. On the other hand, other data involving chemical modification of E. coli EF-G have been interpreted as indicating only local conformational rearrangements at the GTPase site [29]. For EF-G in solution, the GTP affinity has been measured by most experimenters to be around 1≠10 times lower than that for GDP [27,29,30]. However for both EF-G and the related ribosomal GTPase RF3, the GTP affinity is significantly elevated when the factor is bound to the ribosome [30,31]. The classical interpretation has been that, due to the approximately 10-fold higher concentration of GTP in vivo, the EF-G:GDP and EF-G:GTP forms will be approximately in equilibrium in solution. The situation is different for EF-Tu, with requirement for a guanosine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), EFTs. However two groups have measured the GDPNP or GTP affinity of EF-G to be 60 times lower than that of GDP [27,32]. Based on this ratio and on other experiments, Ehrenberg and co-workers have proposed, controversially, that EF-G binds in its GDP form to the ribosome and that the preT ribosome acts as a GEF for EF-G. In contrast, other measurements suggest that the EFG:GDP complex has low affinity for the ribosome [33]. Our structure is compatible with either the classical hypothesis or that of Ehrenberg et al. Since the GDP and GTP forms are very similar in solution, the preT ribosome is able to accept EF-G in either form. What occurs thereafter is a matter of debate. Given that the active GTP conformations of switch II are very much alike in all GTPases [6] it is surprising that there is no significant ordering of the switch I and II regions in the T84A:GDPNP structure. In contrast these regions of the GTP states of EF-Tu and other translational GTPases (tGTPases) are well determined in solution [25,34,35]. Nevertheless previous crystal structures, for example of IF2/eIF5B, have shown that switch I is not necessarily involved in the GTP state ∞ of all tGTPases. In IF2/eIF5B, switch I is located at least 13 A from the c-phosphate moiety with no possibility to reach the latter [25]. However the EF-G:GDPNP structure is consistent with a major role for the ribosome in inducing the active GTPase conformation. How could this take place, thereby increasing the affinity of EF-G for GTP by a factor of 600 [30]? Various data support the idea that the ``P-loop lysine'', Lys25 in EF-G, is involved. We have previously suggested that a hydrogen bond between Lys25 and Thr84 in switch II may be an indication that the conformational changes undergone by EF-G and eEF2 differ from those of other tGTPases [11], in particular EF-Tu. Thr84 is part of the highly conserved D[T/

IF2 (GDP, violet and GDPNP, salmon), aIF2 (GDPNP, light green), SelB (GDP, orange and GDPNP, wheat) and EF-Tu (GDP, light orange and GDPNP, yellow) belong to group I, where the P-loop lysine interacts with the nucleotide, while EF-G (GDP, dark green), T84A (GDP, purple and GDPNP, cyan) and eEF2 (slate) belong to group II, where it is locked into an interaction with the beginning of switch II.

of GTP. The K25A mutation in T. thermophilus EF-G decreases the GTPase activity (ATG et al., in preparation) and a similar mutation in EF-Tu (K24E) abolishes the GTP affinity [37]. This evidence, together with the functional and structural importance of this universally conserved lysine reported for several GTPases and ATPases [38,39], seems to imply that Lys25 is important for the interaction with GTP on the ribosome. In order to bind GTP with higher affinity [30] the Lys25:Thr84 interaction in EF-G may be disturbed such that Lys25 can interact with the b- and c-phosphates of GTP, most likely by ribosome-induced conformational changes. Such a movement of switch II is observed in the eEF1A:eEF1Ba complex during nucleotide exchange [40]. However the role of the P-loop lysine in nucleotide binding and GTPase activity requires further investigation. While this manuscript was being evaluated we solved the structure of the T84A mutant in complex with the closely related analogue GDPCP. This structure confirms the general absence of large-scale conformational changes and the lack of ordering of switch I or II. It does not exhibit the peptide flip which we have attributed here to the presence of the imido nitrogen atom. Further details of this structure will be presented elsewhere.

S]PGH motif found in all EF-G/eEF2 sequences (Fig. 6) [3]. In all other tGTPases for which the GTP and GDP conformations are known, the P-loop lysine makes contact with both nucleotides (Fig. 5). In contrast, in all structures of wild-type EF-G and eEF2 the interaction between the P-loop lysine and the threonine or serine in switch II is conserved. According to chemical modification studies [36] one lysine is involved in nucleotide binding in EF-G. GTP affinity is abolished when this lysine is modified by pyridoxal phosphate, but this effect can be eliminated by protecting the lysine through pre-binding
