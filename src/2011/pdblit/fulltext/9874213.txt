The [2Fe-2S]ferredoxin I (Fd I) from parsley leaves (M r 10500; 96 amino acids) in the Fe(III)Fe(III) oxidized form has been studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Sequence-specific 1H-NMR assignments were obtained through two-dimensional classical double-quantum-filtered-COSY, NOESY and ° TOCSY spectra. NOEs between protons as close as 5.6 A from the paramagnetic Fe(III) atoms were observed at 800 MHz. A total of 3066 NOEs (of which 2533 are meaningful) and 18 distance constraints taken from X-ray crystallography of the Fe2S2 active site were used to obtain the solution structure. From inversion recovery NOESY experiments, 33 longitudinal relaxation rate (Æpara) constraints were used for the structural refinement. The final structure was obtained by a process of restrained energy minimization. Root-mean-square (rmsd) deviation values obtained for the family of 18 structures (with reference to the ° ° average structure) are 0.52 0.10 A and 0.91 0.12 A for backbone and all heavy atoms respectively. The structure consists of seven-strands of -sheets and four short A-helices. The quality of the present solution structure is among the best of those reported for [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins. The secondary structure and overall folding are compared with those of Anabaena variabilis Fd and the higher plant Equistum arvense (horse tail) protein determined through X-ray crystallography. The groups believed to be responsible for electron transfer have been analysed. Keywords : ferredoxin; solution structure; paramagnetism.

Plant [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins are very important redox components involved in photosystem I (PSI) electron transport [1 3]. They perform one-electron transfer (ET) from subunit PsaC of PSI to ferredoxin NADP-reductase (FNR), ferredoxin nitrite oxidoreductase, glutamate synthase and sulfite reductase [4]. There are now more than 75 amino acid sequences for this class of protein from higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria [1] (Table 1). Plant ferredoxins are very acidic (pI 3.4), with a charge balance of 18( 2) at pH 7.5 from amino acid compositions. ° From X-ray crystallography on cyanobacteria PSI (6 A resolution), it appears that the PSI subunits PsaD, PsaE and PsaC are involved in establishing an electrostatic orientation of the [2Fe2S]ferredoxins [5 7]. Biochemical analysis of the PsaC subunit has shown that it contains two [4Fe-4S]clusters [7 10]. Five X-ray crystal structures of oxidized [Fe(III)Fe(III)] [2Fe-2S] proteins from Spirulina platensis [11], Aphanothece sacrum [12], Anabaena variabilis PCC 7120 [13, 14], Halobacterium marismortui [15] and Equisetum arvense (horse tail) [16], have been reported. The redox centers of [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins consist of two non-identical high-spin tetrahedral Fe(III) atoms bridged by two µ-sulfido groups [4]. Each iron atom is also coordinated to two cysteines (RS ). Reduced [2Fe-2S] proteins contain one Fe(III) and one Fe(II). NMR investigations of reduced [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins have shown that the extra-electron is

located on Fe(I), which is the Fe closest to the protein surface ° ( 5 A) [17]. The NMR technique is a powerful method for determining solution structures of small biomolecules. At first it was believed that it would be very difficult (or impossible) to detect a sufficiently large number of constraints for solution structure determination of paramagnetic metalloproteins. Since the first NMR solution structure of a paramagnetic protein in 1994 [18], new strategies and approaches have been introduced. In the few NMR solution structures of oxidized [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins reported from Pseudomonas putida [19], Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 [20] and Synechococcus elongatus [21], the quality of the structures is severely hampered by the lack of NOEs closer than ° about 8 A from the iron atoms, as previously noted [22]. To achieve a reasonable folding it was necessary to introduce several bond distances and angles derived from the X-ray crystal structure for the [2Fe-2S] active centers as well as for nearby residues. Here we report the solution structure of oxidized parsley ferredoxin I (Fd I) using high-resolution 800-MHz NMR spectroscopy. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein isolation and purification. The parsley [2Fe2S]ferredoxins were isolated by literature procedures [23, 24]. Isoferredoxins I, II and III (Fd I, Fd II and Fd III in order of elution) were separated by using a phenyl superose HR 5/5 hydrophobic column attached to a Pharmacia FPLC system. Of these, Fd I is the main fraction (70%), and was used in NMR studies. The purity was checked using the ratio of the ultraviolet visible absorbance at 422 nm to that at 277 nm. A

sample with a ratio of A422/A 277 greater than 0.62 was considered acceptable for present studies [25]. Sample preparation. Samples (3.5 4.0 mM) for NMR solution studies were prepared in 44 mM sodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 7.0, in H2O/D2O (90 :10) solution. The pH of the solution was measured using a PHM62 Radiometer equipped with a Russell CMAWL/3.7/1.80 combined Ag/AgCl/glass electrode. The ionic strength (I) of the solution was maintained at 0.10 M by the phosphate buffer. The NMR samples were prepared in the required buffer using ultrafiltration methods (Amicon YM3 membrane). Concentrations of the oxidized protein were determined by ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry at 422 nm ( 9200 M 1 cm 1). The protein solution was then loaded into an NMR tube flushed with argon ( 30 min at 0°C) and sealed. NMR spectroscopy. All 1H-NMR spectra were acquired on Bruker AVANCE 800 and AVANCE 600 spectrometers operating at 800.13 Hz and 600.13 MHz, respectively. The 1H-NMR one-dimensional spectra were recorded using the super WEFT (water-eliminated Fourier transform) pulse sequence [26], with recycle delay times ranging from 200 ms to 1 s. The NMR spectra were obtained by using water presaturation during both relaxation delay and mixing time, and the watergate sequence [27] prior to acquisition. TPPI NOESY spectra [28, 29] at 298 K and 288 K in H2O/D2O (90:10) solution were recorded at a spectral width of 13 14 ppm, with recycle times of 1 s and mixing times of 100 ms and 30 ms. TPPI TOCSY spectra [30] were recorded with recycle times of 1 s and spin-lock times of 80 ms and 30 ms at 288 K and 298 K. TPPI Double-quantum-filtered (DQF)-COSY spectra [31], with presaturation during relaxation delay, were recorded with recycle times of 1 s at 298 K. All the above two-dimensional spectra consisted of 4 K data points in the F2 dimension and a number of increments in the F1 dimension ranging from 512 to 1024, and were acquired using 112 scans/experiment. A set of inversion-recovery NOESY experiments (recycle delay-180°--NOESY) [32] with 100 ms NOESY mixing time and recovery time  values of 15, 30, 50, 100 and 150 ms were performed (1.0 s of recycle delay, 2 K 512 data points). Raw data were multiplied in both dimensions by a pure cosine-squared function and Fourier-transformed to obtain 1024 1024 real data points. A polynomial base-line correction was applied in both directions. All spectra were calibrated assuming a chemical shift of 4.81 ppm and 4.93 ppm for the water signal at 298 K and 288 K respectively. All NMR data were processed with the Bruker UXNMR and XWINNMR software packages. The program XEASY (ETH Zürich) was used for analysis of the two-dimensional spectra [33]. In the inversion recovery NOESY experiment, the intensity of a given cross-peak is proportional to the residual magnetization after the 180°- perturbation of the proton whose diagonal signal lies in the same column of the cross peak itself [32], provided the recycle delay is long enough. Modeling of iron-sulfur cluster. Since 1H-NMR cannot monitor the iron and sulfur nuclei, an artificial model of the cluster is necessary. The iron-sulfur cluster was successfully described in the solution structure of a [4Fe-4S] protein in 1994 [18]. A new amino acid (Cys-Fe-S) consisting of a cysteine to which a Fe and a S atom were attached was built into a distance geometry (DG) routine. The bond lengths between Fe and S of different amino acids were given upper distance limits by using data taken as averages from X-ray crystallography. In previous investigations of [2Fe-2S] proteins, the modeling of the cluster was achieved by imposing 41 constraints from X-ray data [19, 20]. Since the primary structure of the present protein is similar to that of proteins for which the X-ray structure is available (Table 1), we succeeded in solving the structure by taking from X-ray data only 18 distances between iron and sulfur atoms in

the cluster (14 plus 4 additional covalent bonds in the two CysFe-S residues) without imposing any additional constraints to the surrounding amino acids. The 4 imposed bond lengths and 14 upper and lower distance limits are summarized in Table 2. Distance calculation. The volume of the NOESY crosspeaks of assigned resonances were obtained using the integration routines in the program XEASY on an IBM RISC6000 computer system. Most of the dipolar connectivities were taken from the 100 ms NOESY spectrum at 298 K. NOESY cross-peak intensities were converted into interatomic upper distance limits by the program CALIBA [34]. The limits obtained from CALIBA were classified as five different classes of connectivities [33 36], as reported in Table 3. The experimental distance constraints were then used to generate protein conformers by using the torsion angle dynamic (TAD) program DYANA with a simulated annealing algorithm [37]. The inversion recovery NOESY build ups were best fitted to the following exponential recovery equation : I(t) I( ) ( I( ) I(0) ) exp( Æefft) I (1) where I( ) is the equilibrium value of the magnetization, I(0) is the value of the magnetization immediately after the inversion pulse, I(t) is the value of the magnetization at time t, and Æeff I is the effective longitudinal relaxation rate. The lower limits for the paramagnetic contributions to nuclear relaxation, Æpara, were I determined by subtracting a value of 5 s 1 from Æeff, considered I to be an upper limit for proton relaxation rates if there were not paramagnetic contributions [38]. To include distance constraints into structure calculation, it is necessary to relate Æpara to the metal(s)-proton distance. As I discussed elsewhere by our group [39, 40] and by others [41 43]: n Æpara I K

where rIj is the distance of the proton to the iron j and the sum is extended to all the n iron atoms of the protein. Owing to their common dipolar origin, Æpara can be used like and in conjunction I with NOE's. The upper distance limits, d u, were obtained from the Æpara values through the relationship : I d

The upper distance limits were iteratively modified after each DYANAT1 [38] run, analogously to the 1H-1H upper distance limits. This was accomplished by defining the quantity ri :

where rij is the distance between proton i and metal j, and the sum is over the two metal ions of the cluster. Lower distance limits, d 1, initially obtained from Eqn (3) with a 100-fold lower value of K, were then readjusted, together with the upper distance limits, after successive DYANAT1 calculations. The sixth roots of the experimental values of Æpara, plotted versus the I average rI values as determined from the structures obtained after each DYANAT1 run, are shown in Fig. 1. The two lines in Fig. 1 represent the final values of the upper and lower distance limits. This approach (CALIBAT1) is analogous to that designed by Wüthrich to calibrate 1H-1H dipolar constraints using the program CALIBA [34]. Structure calculation. The program DYANA uses an algorithm based on simulated annealing combined with torsion angle dynamics (TAD). With the preliminary structures available, the scaling factors for the volume-to-distance conversion for each class were evaluated by plotting volumes of peaks arising from pairs of protons at a fixed distance. As the structure emerged

from successive runs of DYANA calculations, selected interatomic distances were taken from these structures and additional calibrations were determined. Several cycles of the structure calculations were carried out in order to recalibrate the NOE distance constraints. At this stage, new NOESY cross-peaks were

assigned by using the program CORMA [44]. This program is based on relaxation matrix calculations which make it possible to back calculate from the structure the expected NOEs between each proton pair. A single correlation time, set to 4 ns, was used. These calculations were performed on structures already of good quality, and therefore the improvement brought about by the additional constraints was minor. Stereospecific assignments of diastereotopic protons and methyl groups were obtained using the program GLOMSA [34]. The final DYANA calculations were performed by using 10000 steps of annealing and creating 50 random structures. The 18 structures with the lowest target function were included in the family. The constraints from inversion recovery NOESY were added to the structure calculation in the last stages of refinement by using the program DYANAT1 as described above. Again, 50 random structures were annealed in 10 000 steps, and the 18 structures with the lowest target function were included in the family. Energy minimization. Restrained energy minimization (REM) on the family of 18 structures obtained from DYANAT1 calculations with the lowest target function was performed with the SANDER module [45] of the AMBER 4.1 program package [46]. For comparison purposes, the same calculations were per-

formed on the family of structures obtained without the T1 constraints. Structure analysis. The programs PROCHECK [47], MOLMOL and RASMOL [48] were used for the secondary structure analysis, solvent-accessibility calculations, hydrogen-bonding calculation and structure display. RESULTS Assignment. Table 4 reports the assigned 1H-NMR resonances. Spin-patterns were first obtained from TOCSY and DQF-COSY [49, 50] spectra using standard procedures [51]. The spectra allowed the identification of 66 spin-patterns in the diamagnetic ° region ( 10 A from paramagnetic centers). Spectra acquired at different temperatures (288 K and 298 K), or using different mixing times gave useful information to distinguish the overlapping cross peaks. The side chains of Asp60, Asp65 and Val74 were resolved by analyzing TOCSY and NOESY spectra at different temperatures. However, cross-peak patterns from several other residues are not fully observed due to paramagnetic broadening. Cross-peaks may escape detection whenever the paramagnetic iron atoms produce a severe line broadening on one or both of the resonances from which cross-peaks should be observed. Unusual shift values were observed for the amide protons (HN) of residues Gly49, Lys50, Val51, Leu64 and Ala79 (Table 4). Amide protons of residues Ala1, Asn4, Tyr23, Val24, Ala28, Tyr37, Ser38, Cys39, Ser43, Cys44, Ser45, Ser46,

Cys47, Ser62, Phe63, Cys77 and His78 could not be identified using 100 ms and 30 ms mixing times in the TOCSY spectra. However the DQF-COSY and NOESY spectra allowed us to identify the amide protons of residues Asn4, Tyr23, Val24, Ala28 and Tyr37. The HN of Phe63 was assigned on the basis of sequential Phe63HN Leu64HN or Phe63HN Leu64HA connectivities. The HN of Ala1 and His78 have not been identified, possibly due to rapid exchange with water. Also, protons resonances of some side chains such as Leu25H, His78H (H), Leu75H, Gln61H and Ser62HA (H) could not be identified, possibly because they are located mainly in the paramagnetic-exposed region of the protein. Segments 38 40, 43 47 and residue 72 are very close ( 5.6) to the paramagnetic irons, and it was impossible to observe their cross-peaks. The resonances of HA of 38 39, 43 47, 62 and 77 also escaped detection, again possibly due to rapid nuclear relaxation caused by the paramagnetic iron atoms. A few weak peaks remained unidentified in the two-dimensional spectra, but they yield no information about spin patterns or sequence connectivities. Sequence-specific assignment. Comparison of known amino acid sequences with the spin patterns obtained from the TOCSY and DQF-COSY spectra allowed us to perform the sequencespecific assignment. Using 100 ms NOESY spectra (288 K and 298 K), sequence-specific connectivities were determined for HA-HN, H-HN, H-HN, and in the case of prolines HA-H and HN-H between neighboring amino acids.

connectivities for stretches longer than two residues were observed for positions Thr2 Thr9, Asp11 Ile35, Ala41 Gly42, Gly49 Gln61, Leu64 Tyr76, Ala79 Tyr80 and Thr82 Val96. Some connectivities could not be identified. This could be explained by either the paramagnetism, deprotonation of some HN groups, or presence of prolines which do not have an amide proton. Determination of sequencial connectivities of Lys50 Val51 and Ala28 Glu29 was difficult because both cross-peaks of HN were located in the same position. Also the fragments Ala41 Gly42 and Ala49 Lys50, located in a borderline region as far as paramagnetic effects are concerned, were assigned from inter-residual connectivities between Lys50HN and Val51HN. This procedure gave extensive assignments (except for the immediate paramagnetic region) of the oxidized form of parsley Fd I. In all, 84% of the proton resonances have been assigned (Table 4). Secondary structure. After the assignment of backbone and side-chain protons, the NOESY maps were used to find dipolar connectivities. The short and medium range sequential NOEs of Fig. 2 were determined from the 100-ms NOESY spectrum. The

connectivities which indicate A-helical structure [51] were observed for the following residues : HA-H (i,i 3) for residues 25 28, 58, 65 68, 91; HA-HN (i,i 3) for residues 9 10, 19, 23 28, 58, 65 68, 91 93; and HA-HN (i,i 4) for residues 8, 24 27, 29, 66, 68, 69, 92. These data indicate the presence of a helical motifs for the residues 23 29, 65 69 and 91 93. Backbone (i,i 2) connectivities for residues indicated helical structures of the 310 type [51]. Solution structure calculations. A total of 3066 experimental NOE constraints were assigned, integrated and converted into upper distance limit constraints by using the program CALIBA. From the inversion recovery NOESY experiments, the Æpara values of 33 resonances with Teff values lower than 110 ms were 1 obtained. These values, together with the corresponding upper and lower distance limits used in the final calculation, are given in Table 5. In addition, 18 constraints defining the topology of the polymetallic center were introduced as described in the experimental section (Table 2). A family of 18 preliminary structures were obtained through the program DYANA, which showed that 2547 constraints were

relevant. The meaningful NOE constraints are 26.5/residue, distributed as shown in Fig. 3 a. Altogether, 83 stereospecific assignments of diastereotopic groups were obtained through the program GLOMSA. In the final DYANA run, a family of 18 structures was generated with ° average target function of 1.03 0.20 A2. The rmsd values with respect to the mean structure (calculated on residues 2 96) are ° ° 0.63 0.09 A and 1.00 0.15 A for backbone and all heavy atoms, respectively. In addition, 33 Æpara constraints were added during the DYANAT1 calculations (Fig. 3 b). A family of 18 structures was ob° tained with average target function of 0.74 0.12 A2, and an ° rmsd from the mean structure of 0.53 0.08 A for the backbone ° atoms, and 0.89 0.12 A for the heavy atoms (Table 6). Compared with the analogous family without T1 constraints, both the target function and rmsd were decreased, especially the rmsds of the cluster atoms (Table 6). The 18 structures of the DYANAT1 family were used as starting structures for restrained energy minimization (REM) calculations. The mean global rmsd values for residues 2 96 in the REM family were quite similar to those from the DYANAT1 family with Æpara constraints (Table 6). The backbone and all heavy atoms rmsd values/residue are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows a stereo representation of the backbone and the cluster atoms for the family of 18 REM structures.

Structure analysis. The rmsd values represent the degree of resolution of the calculated structure. The quality of the present family of structures has been also analyzed in terms of ideal geometry parameters with the PROCHECK-NMR program (Fig. 6). The program was run on the structure closest to the mean structure. The structure did not show any noticeable deviation from ideality. This shows that the experimental NOESY Æpara constraints are sufficient to produce the correct protein folding. The N-terminus (Ala1) shows relatively high backbone ° rmsd values (1.59 A, Fig. 4), probably due to high mobility and

Im et al. (Eur. J. Biochem. 258)

The aromatic side chains of Tyr37 and His78 show disorder ° ° with relatively large rmsd values of 2.82 A and 2.35 A, respectively. This is due to paramagnetic broadening and lack of NOEs. The side chains of other aromatic residues, Tyr3, Tyr73, Tyr80, Phe16 and His90, are very well defined with low rmsd values. The solvent-accessible surface of residues was calculated using the program MolMol. The buried residues show small values and are in general well defined because the residues are more rigidly packed than solvent accessible residues. Acidic residues (23% of total amino acids) occupy about 40% of the surface, hydrophobic residues (44% of total) occupy only about 27% of the surface, and basic residues (5% of total) occupy about 8 % of the surface. Thus, acidic and basic residues are mainly on the surface, and hydrophobic residues are mainly in the interior of parsley Fd I.

also to the low number of NOEs (Fig. 3). In general, the terminal residues are very flexible and show this behavior in many the solution structures. On the contrary, the C-terminal end (residues 92 94) shows a very well-defined backbone (rmsd values ° 0.50 A), although the side chains are disordered with rather ° high rmsd values (1.25 2.30 A, Fig. 4). The last residue (Val96) is again quite well defined, due to the relatively large number of NOEs. There are four protein regions which are characterized by rmsd values lower than those for the whole protein. These are the segments 2 36, 48 60, 63 73 and 80 91. All these segments are located in diamagnetic region. The highest back° bone rmsd values (0.82 1.46 A) of the segments 37 45 and 75 77 (Fig. 4) correspond to the cluster region, whose residues are involved in few detectable NOEs connectivities. Despite the lower resolution as compared to other parts of the protein, this region is remarkably more similar to homologous regions of the proteins for which the X-ray structure has been solved (Fig. 6) than to homologous regions of the proteins for which the solution structure has been solved.

Comparison with other [2Fe-2S] structures. It is difficult, but where possible meaningful, to compare proteins from different sources. The program PROCHECK was used to display the main secondary structure elements using Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of secondary structure elements of [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins. The main secondary structure elements of parsley Fd I are the seven -sheets sections 3 7, 16 18, 49 51, 56 57, 73 74, 81 82 and 86 89, and four Ahelices at 24 30, 68 71, 76 78 and 92 95. Synechococcus elongatus Fd has six -sheets and three A-helices [21]. The Ahelical region from 76 to 78 and the -sheet region from 49 to 51 in parsley Fd I are not observed in the S. elongatus Fd. In the hydrogen-bonding calculations carried out by the MolMol program (data not shown), N-H · · · O bond distances less than ° 2.5 A and angles larger than 120° were considered for identification of the hydrogen bonds [52, 53]. The calculations show that parsley Fd I has an extra hydrogen bond with respect to S. elongatus Fd at 51Val-HN · · · O-Gly72. This H-bond is present in all 18 structures. The average rmsd values between each component of the family and the mean structure for parsley Fd I (Table 6) show that the structure quality is much better than that of the recently ° reported solution structure of S. elongatus Fd I (rmsd of 0.87 A ° for backbone and 1.30 A for all heavy atoms) [21]. Residues

35 49 and 60 65 were reported to have the largest rmsd values in the solution structure of S. elongatus, as also found in the present case because of the paramagnetic region. The previous solution studies proposed a disulfide bridge between Cys18 and Cys85. Such a bridge could be responsible for the absence of the -sheet region 82 83 [20]. However, the disulfide bridge has never been observed in X-ray crystallographic studies. The distance between the two cysteine sulfurs of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Fd in solution was reported to ° be shorter ( 7.3 A) than that from the corresponding [2Fe-2S] ° X-ray structures ( 10 A) [20]. The case of parsley Fd I is clearcut, because this protein has only one free cysteine (Cys18) and no disulfide bridge in that region can exist. Parsley Fd I has a Val85 instead of Cys85. The distances between the S of Cys18 and residue 85-CA (or 18-C-A and residue 85-CA) are 10.01 ° (9.90), 8.67 (7.10) and n.a. (9.37) A for parsley Fd I, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 Fd and horse tail Fd (no Cys18), respectively. Apparently, the structure of parsley Fd I shows no distortion in this region that may prevent the formation of a -sheet, and is very similar to the X-ray structures of horse tail Fd and Anabaena variabilis PCC7120 [13, 14, 16]. The present solution structure is compared in Fig. 7A, B with that obtained through analysis in the 55% similar plant

ferredoxin from Equisetum arvense (horse tail) [16], which is the only high plant Fd published. The two structures superimpose rather well. The main secondary structure elements of the structure elements of the E. arvense X-ray structure are seven -sheets (at residues 2 8, 11 17, 47 52, 55 56, 72 75, 78 80, 83 87) and two A-helices (at residues 23 29 and 65 69). The third A-helix region (92 95) of parsley Fd I is not apparent in horse tail Fd I from X-ray structure. However, the X-ray structure of A. variabilis PCC7120 Fd does show a A-helix in this region [13, 14]. The different length of -sheets at residues 16 18 and 86 89 in parsley Fd I with respect to horse tail ferredoxin might be explained with the fact that there are no amino acid similarities at positions 11 15 and 83 86, and the -sheets have distorted conformations with high rmsd values. The cluster and regions around it still superimpose less well than the diamagnetic region of the protein (Fig. 6), even though the similarity in the cluster region is higher than the overall similarity between the two proteins. However, as already mentioned, among the solution structures available the present one is the closest to the X-ray structures in the cluster region. We notice that the use of inversion-recovery constraints for paramagnetic effects constitute a successful strategy for the definition of the solution structure of paramagnetic metalloproteins.

DISCUSSION The determination of solution structures of [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins is most difficult because of the paramagnetism of the Fe(III)Fe(III) center. In previous solution studies it has always been assumed that the structure around the paramagnetic cluster was identical to that from X-ray crystallography. Structure information about this region was available only through X-ray. With the possible exception of the cysteine ligands and NH protons H-bonded to the sulfur donors, paramagnetic line broadening effects are dominated by dipolar through-space interactions and are proportional to 1/r 6, where r is the distance from the paramagnetic center and the nucleus [54]. A particular case of dipolar line broadening, called Curie broadening [55, 56], that may be dominant in macromolecules is the interaction with the time-averaged electron spin magnetic moment. The relationships are as follows: R2M(dip) 1 µ0 15 4 1 µ0 5 4

where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of a vacuum, I is the ´ nuclear magnetogyric ratio, ge is the electron Lande factor, µB is the Bohr-magneton, S the electron spin quantum number, r is the electron nuclear distance, s and I are the electron and nuclear Larmor frequencies, and  r is the rotational correlation time of the protein. These equations account for the difficulties in observing several signals. Oh and Markley [22] proposed that the two irons of oxidized ferredoxin have the same paramagnetic effect and defined a paramagnetic border in the vicinity of the iron atoms. They ob° served no proton resonances within 7.8 A of the irons in oxidized A. variabilis PCC7120 ferredoxin. No NOE in this region could be observed or used for the solution structure determination of [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins [22]. Contrary to this, we have been able to observe several broad cross-peaks in the range from ° ° 7.8 A down to 5.6 A from the iron atoms (see above) by optimizing the NOE experiments. Fig. 8 summarizes the improvement in the assignments made for the paramagnetic region in the present study. The upper distance limits obtained from such NOESY cross-peaks have been invaluable in helping to define the structure in the cluster region. Inversion-recovery NOESY experiments are an easy and fast method for the measurement of non-selective longitudinal relaxation rates. From the latter, Æpara values are extracted, which provide structural constraints around the paramagnetic center. In these regions the threshold of detectability of dipolar and scalar connectivities is increased, and less structural information is obtained through ordinary techniques. Non-selective longitudinal relaxation rates lead to a structure in which the region that are poor in NOE constraints and better defined. Furthermore, the cluster itself results better defined because the nuclear relaxation enhancement tend to define better the position of the iron ions with respect to all the protons experiencing paramagnetic relaxation enhancement. Therefore, a better structure of a paramagnetic metalloprotein, including the paramagnetic center itself, is obtained with a high degree of resolution (Fig. 7 A). Analysis of this structure in terms of ideal features (Fig. 6), shows that 42 residues out of a total of 85 meaningful residues (glycine, proline and terminal residues are excluded) have  and dihedral angles which fall in the most favored region (49.2 % of the meaningful residues). In addition 39 residues are found in the allowed region (49.4 % of the total), 3 (3.5% of the total)

in the generously allowed region, and 1 residue, Cys47, in the disallowed region. The folding of the protein is very similar to that found by X-ray crystallography on homologous proteins. However, the similarities between the parsley Fd I and Equisetum arvense Fd I are only 55%, and the backbone rmsd value ° between them is only slightly higher than 1.3 A. Slight differences in secondary structure elements seem to be real. The rmsd for the REM family is essentially the same as that found after distance geometry calculations. However, the cluster is more regular and better defined after REM. The present study also shows that the hydrophobic residues occupy the interior of the protein and more than approximately 48% of the surface is made by acidic and basic residues. Hydrophobic groups inside the protein may be advantageous for fast electron transfer. Charged residues on the surface favor binding with groups such as PsaD and FNR. As mentioned above, positively charged regions on physiological partners interact with negatively charged regions on the ferredoxin. The protein contains four acidic patches (19 21, 29 31, 65 67 and 92 94) comprising Glu and Asp residues. The side chains are ° considerably disordered with rmsd of about 1.08 2.30 A. These sites are a characteristic feature of [2Fe-2S]ferredoxins and have been suggested, from chemical modification and kinetics studies with inorganic redox partners, to be electron transfer (ET) sites. Despite the relatively high rmsd values of several Glu and Asp side chains, the corresponding backbone regions are very similar to those found in the X-ray structure of the ferredoxin from the A. variabilis so that the overall side-chain orientations are maintained, allowing us to state that the four acidic patches are maintained. The largest backbone rmsd for the two proteins is in the first patch, 19 21. However, even in this case the and  angles are similar, indicating that only a translational movement of the backbone has occurred. A comment is due to the spatial arrangement of residues Glu92 and Phe63 (Glu94 and Phe65 in A. variabilis ferredoxin), which are believed to have critical roles in electron transfer from Fd to the physiological partner ferredoxin-NADP reductase [57, 58]. A hydrogen bond between Glu94 and Ser47 in A. variabilis ferredoxin (Glu92 and Ser45 in our case) has been suggested as important in both protein stabilization and electron transfer. Unfortunately, Ser45 is not assigned. The side chain of Glu92 is somewhat disordered, but on the average it occupies a similar position as Glu94 in the X-ray structure of A. variabilis ferredoxin. The side chain of Phe63 is reasonably well resolved, and the aromatic ring is found to be rotated about 90° from the corresponding Phe65 ring in A. variabilis ferredoxin, thus grossly altering its Van der Waals interaction capabilities. This finding suggests that while the presence of an aromatic ring in this position may be important, its orientation may be not. The internal salt bridges of S. elongatus ferredoxin Lys51 Glu56 and Arg83 Asp58 were not found in the case parsley Fd I, which has Lys50 Ser55 and Thr82 Asp57 in these positions. In addition, S. elongatus Fd has more hydrogen bonds (e.g., Ala29 Leu26, Glu71 Asp68, Ala80 Leu76 and Ala80 Thr77) than those of parsley Fd I. Together with the hydrophobicity of the cluster, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are believed to contribute to protein stability. The absence of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds could be partly responsible for the lower stability of parsley Fd I, which is evidenced by the high instability of the reduced form. REFERENCES
