Abstract
Soybean leghemoglobin a is a small (16 kDa) protein facilitating the transport of Oz to respiring N2-fixing bacteria at low free-O2 tension. The crystal structure of soybean ferric leghemoglobin a nicotinate has been refined at 2.3 A resolution. The final R factor is 15.8% for 6877 reflections between 6.0 and 2.3 ~. The structure of soybean leghemoglobin a (143 residues) is closely similar to that of lupin leghemoglobin II (153 residues), the proteins having 82 identical residues when the sequences are aligned. The new structure provides support for the conclusion that the unique properties of leghemoglobin arise principally from a heme pocket considerably larger and more flexible than that of myoglobin, a strongly ruffled heme group, and a proximal histidine orientation more favourable to ligand binding.

1. Introduction
The monomeric leghemoglobins (Lb's) of the symbiotic tissue of nitrogen-fixing legume root nodules have a function analogous to that of animal cytoplasmic myoglobins: the reversible binding and transport of oxygen by facilitated diffusion (Appleby, 1984, 1992). In animal cells this oxygen is used for respiration and energy generation by oxygen-tolerant mitochondria. Within nodule symbiotic tissue it is consumed by the rapidly respiring yet oxygen-intolerant Rhizobiurn, Bradyrhizobiurn or Azorhizobiurn bacteroids to generate the large amount of ATP necessary for the reduction of nitrogen to ammonia. The leghemoglobins have very high oxygen affinities (Gibson, Wittenberg, Wittenberg, Bogusz & Appleby, 1989), so that a sufficient oxygen flux is achieved at a free concentration (~5-20 nM) which is too low to inhibit, damage or prevent biosynthesis of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogen-reducing enzymes within these bacteroids. The leghemoglobins of the various legume symbioses consist of a 16-17kDa polypeptide chain synthesized

in the host cytoplasm of bacteroid-infected plant cells, and a protoheme moiety that is also a plant product (O'Brian, 1996). The assembled leghemoglobin remains in the host cell cytoplasm, being separated from intimate contact with bacteroid surfaces by the presence of peribacteroid membranes that surround each small group of bacteroids (Appleby, 1992). Kinetics measurements (Gibson et al., 1989) reveal that the high oxygen affinity of leghemoglobins is due to association ('on') rate constants 10-20 times faster than for myoglobins, with dissociation ('off') rate constants of the same order as for myoglobins. The normal 'off' rate is essential for the biological function of leghemoglobins in facilitated diffusion. Other unusual properties include the ability to bind bulky ligands such as nicotinic acid and carboxylic acids from acetic to valeric (C1 to C5) (Ellfolk, 1961; Appleby, 1984; Atanasov, Dimitrova, Kudryatseva, Zhiznevskaya & Appleby, 1989). Most of the studies of Lb in solution have dealt with Lb a from soybean (Glycine max), while most of the X-ray crystallographic studies have centered on Lb II from yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus) (see, for example, Narula, Dalvit, Appleby & Wright, 1988; Harutyunyan et al., 1995). The soybean and lupin proteins are distant on the phylogenetic tree (Andersson, Jensen, Llewellyn, Dennis & Peacock, 1997), and differ significantly in length: soybean Lb a has 143 residues while lupin Lb II has 153 residues. When the two sequences are aligned, they have identical residues at 82 positions. To help understand how Lb's function we present here the crystal structure of soybean ferric Lb a nicotinate refined at 2.3 A resolution. Nicotinate (pyridine 3-carboxylate) binds to ferric Lb about 50 000-fold more strongly than to ferric myoglobin. Although the nicotinate anion complex is not of physiological significance (Klucas & Appleby, 1991), the crystal structure analysis has revealed features that may help to explain the fast oxygenation rate constants of the leghemoglobins.

2. Experimental
The structure of soybean Lb a nicotinate was solved by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) at 3.3 ]k resolution, as described previously (Ollis et al., 1983). We here report the refinement at 2.3 ~ resolution.

3. Results

Selected unit-cell properties, data-collection statistics, and results of the refinement are shown in Table 1. The initial coordinates used in the present work were obtained from a partial refinement of the MIR structure without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints (W. N. Hunter, unpublished work). These coordinates were modified by imposing the non-crystallographic symmetry on the two independent molecules, setting the B factors of all atoms to 20 ~2, manually optimizing the fit to F,,b~ maps, and deleting about 100 atoms that could not be accommodated in good density. A similar starting model would have been obtained if the same modifications had been applied to the MIR structure. Refinement was carried out by restrained leastsquares, using PROLSQ (Hendrickson & Konnert, 1980; Hendrickson, 1985) and later PROFFT (Finzel, 1987), alternating with manual intervention. The program used for manual adjustments of the model was FRODO (Jones, 1978). Electron-density maps were calculated with coefficients Fobs, F,,bs-Fcalc and 2Fobs-Fcalc. All regions of the structure were subjected to detailed examination using omit maps. During the refinement, the data range was extended in stages from 5.0-2.5 A (5584 reflections) to 6.0-2.3 ~ (6877 reflections), the initially tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were relaxed and finally removed, and H atoms were added. The Fe--ligand bonds were weakly restrained during the early stages of the refinement, and unrestrained during the final stages. Only restraints to keep each heme pyrrole ring and the two adjacent methene C atoms coplanar were applied throughout the refinement. Electron-density peaks with amplitude > 40- in F,,b~- Fc~lc or omit maps, and with one or more plausible hydrogen-bonding contacts, were assigned as water molecules. Water molecules whose amplitude fell below 40-, or whose B value exceeded 35/~2,

3.1. Assessment of accuracy and precision The final model comprises 2332 non-H and 2258 H atoms, representing two Lb molecules plus 70 solvent molecules [treated as O(water) atoms]. Each Lb molecule consists of the polypeptide, a heme group, and a coordinated nicotinate. The structure has a residual R= 15.8% for 6877 reflections with Fob~>20.(F) in the range 6.0-2.3 A. The r.m.s, deviations from the dictionary geometry are 0.009A for bond distances and 1.5 ° for bond angles, respectively. A number of indicators suggest that the uncertainty in the light-atom positions is about 0.2/~. (i) The maximum average error in the atomic positions estimated from a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) is 0.18~. (ii) The r.m.s, difference between corresponding Fe--N bond distances in the two independent molecules is 0.17,~. We assume that the contribution of the Fe-atom positions to this difference is negligible in comparison with the N-atom positions. (iii) When the two independent molecules are superposed, the r.m.s, difference between the positions of corresponding backbone atoms is 0.36 A. If we make the conservative assumption that this difference is due entirely to errors, then the r.m.s, error in the individual atomic positions is 0.25 ]k (i.e., 0.36/21/2). In Ramachandran plots for the final structure (Ramachandran & Sasisekharan, 1968), only one nonglycine residue lies significantly outside the allowed regions. The aberrant residue is Lys142, the residue before the C terminus, in molecule B. The torsion angles for this residue in molecule A are normal. No importance is attached to this discrepancy, as the two C-terminal residues (Lys142 and Ala143) of both molecules are in weak density and have high temperature factors (25-31 ]k2).
3.2. Description of the molecule Soybean Lb a (Fig. 1) has the same 'globin fold' as other monomeric hemoglobins (Bashford, Chothia & Lesk, 1987). The seven helices (A-C, E-H) common to all globin structures account for approximately 75% of the amino acids. The refinement of the structure and a rigorous application of the Kabsch & Sander (1983) criteria have resulted in several minor changes from the original helix assignment of Ollis et al. (1983) (Fig. 2).

FERRIC S O Y B E A N LEGHEMOGLOBIN a NICOTINATE

The temperature factors B averaged over the backbone atoms of each residue have similar patterns in both molecules (Fig. 3). The temperature factors are lowest in the well ordered o~-helical regions, and become higher in the 310-helix C and in the interhelical regions. The highest temperature factors are observed in the carboxyterminal region. 3.3. The heme environment As in other hemoglobins, the heme in soybean Lb a is located in a hydrophobic pocket between the E and F helices. The heme is oriented with the propionate groups projecting away from the hydrophobic pocket and into the solvent (Fig. 4). The side chains which line the heme

pocket belong to residues in the B, C, E, F, G and H helices, and in the CD and FG interhelical regions. The amino acids in the immediate vicinity of the heme are shown in Fig. 5. The heme is strongly ruffled (see below). The heme divides the pocket into two sides, proximal and distal. On the proximal side, the heme is linked to the polypeptide by a bond between the Fe atom and the Ne2(imidazole) atom of the conserved proximal histidine, HisF7. On the distal side, the Fe atom may be coordinated by an exogenous ligand, resulting in a quasioctahedral geometry. The binding of exogenous ligands is influenced by steric and hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues inside the heme pocket. Prominent

Fig. 2. The amino-acid sequence of soybean leghemoglobin a. The helical segments are indicated by boxes. The helix assignments in the refined structure differ from those of Ollis et al. (1983) as follows: Helix A, residues 5-20 (instead of 4-20); helix B, residues 22-36 (21-36): helix C, 38-43 (37-43): helix E, 56-79 (55-79): helix F, 86-93 (86-94): helix H, 123-141 (122-141). A sequence error at the C terminus has been corrected. The helical segments are assigned according to Kabsch & Sander (1983), without distinguishing between the criteria for 3~0- and o-helices.

PAUL J. ELLIS et al. among these is another highly conserved residue, the distal histidine (HisE6 in the present structure) (Bashford et al., 1987). The effect of mutations at HisE6 on dioxygen binding and other properties of Lb is under investigation (Hargrove et al., 1997). The only other residue that is totally conserved in all hemoglobins is a phenylalanine, PheCD1, which is also located on the distal side of the heme pocket and close to the exogenous ligand position. The presence of a water molecule on the distal side of the heme pocket should be noted (Figs. 4-6).

4. Discussion 4.1. The heme group and heme cavity
For a comparison between soybean Lb a nicotinate and myoglobin (Mb) we use a crystallographically characterized derivative of Mb with a bulky exogenous ligand, the sperm whale Mb:imidazole complex (Lionetti, Guanziroli, Frigerio, Ascenzi & Bolognesi, 1991). A superposition of their C '~ atoms shows that Lb has a significantly larger distal heme cavity than Mb (Fig. 7). The increase in volume is associated with a displacement of the heme. The A, B, C, G and H helices of the two proteins align with good agreement, the E helices have closely similar conformations but are out of register, and the CD loops and F helices have quite different conformations, positions and orientations. The shift of the F helix is critical because it permits the change in the position of the heme and the consequent expansion of the heme cavity. The fact that Lb has a larger distal heme cavity than Mb has been reported previously for both soybean Lb a (Ollis et al., 1983) and lupin Lb II (Arutyunyan, Kuranova, Vainshtein & Steigemann, 1980; Arutyunyan, Kuranova, Tovbis et al., 1980; Harutyunyan et al., 1995). The present work enables us to make a semi-quantitative comparison between the volumes of the distal heme cavities: the volume traced by the centre of a 1.4/~ rolling sphere is ,--,15/,-,,18/~ 3 for the independent molecules Fig. 4. The heme pocket of soybean leghemoglobin a nicotinate. The distal and proximal cavities lie above and below the heme, respectively. In the distal cavity, the invariant residues HisE6 (the distal histidine) and PheCD1 are seen to the left and slightly in front of the nicotinate ligand and an internal water molecule (denoted by the asterisk). The heme propionate groups protrude into the solvent.

PAUL J. ELLIS et al. B, C, E, G and H helices all align closely. The main differences again occur in the CD region where soybean Lb has two residues fewer than lupin Lb, and the F helix which is three residues shorter in soybean Lb. The position of the F helix is influenced by its contacts with the H helix, which in soybean Lb is two turns (six residues) shorter at the C-terminal end. The differences at the F helix are associated with a significantly changed conformation at the FG bend. [The helix lengths used in these comparisons are derived by applying the Kabsch & Sander (1983) criteria rigorously to both Lb's.] It is remarkable that the differences between the soybean and lupin Lb polypeptides leave the position and orientation of the heme in relation to the rest of the molecule almost unchanged (Fig. 8). As mentioned above, both proteins have a large distal heme cavity. The height of the cavity is defined largely by the E helix. The E helices of the two proteins superpose almost exactly. The heme groups in soybean and lupin Lb's are similar not only in position and orientation, but also in the degree of non-planarity ('ruffling') (Fig. 9). The ruffling may be described by a parameter F.* Ellis (1995) has calculated values of F for all the crystallographically determined Lb and Mb structures. The values of F for the two independent molecules in soybean Lb a nicotinate are 50 and 41 ° , respectively. The corresponding value
:~ F = -- l A B + / BC - / CD + I D A , where /An is the angle between the normals to the planes of the heme A and B rings. /An is positive if the normals to the planes incline towards each other on the distal side of the heme, and negative if they incline towards each other on the proximal side of the heme.

307

for lupin Lb II nicotinate is 48 °. The smallest F among other lupin Lb II structures is 27 °. In comparison, the heme in Mb is much less ruffled. The largest value of F found in any Mb structure is 20 °. It occurs in the structure of the ferric Mb:imidazole complex (Lionetti et al., 1991). Fig. 9 includes a comparison between the vinyl substituents in soybean and lupin Lb's. Consistent with the conservation of the protein structure in the vicinity of the heme, the vinyl orientations in the two Lb's are closely similar. The orientations found in the crystals are consistent with those found by ~H NMR for soybean carbonmonoxy- and oxy-Lb a, and for lupin carbonmonoxy-Lb I and II (Narula et al., 1988; Mabbutt & Wright, 1983). The environments of the vinyl groups in soybean Lb a are shown in Fig. 10. 4.2. The proximal histidine The hypothesis that oxygen binding in heme proteins is influenced by the proximal histidine is currently receiving attention (see, e.g., Harutyunyan et al., 1995). Within the limits of precision, the orientation of the imidazole group of HisF7 in soybean Lb is the same as in lupin Lb, but different from that in myoglobin. The dihedral angle between the imidazole plane and the heme N a - - F e - - N , : direction is ~22 ° in soybean Lb a nicotinate, -,~32° in lupin Lb II nicotinate, but only 0-7 ° in various forms of sperm whale myoglobin. Steric hindrance between the heme and the imidazole H(C 6) and H(C -~) atoms is greatest when the imidazole is eclipsed with N,, and N,. (as in Mb), and becomes smaller as the

Fig. 9. Superposition of the heme groups in soybean leghemoglobin a nicotinate (heavy lines) and lupin leghemoglobin II nicotinate (light lines). The ruffling of the porphyrin, the orientations of the propionate groups, and the configurations of the vinyl groups are closely similar. The differences between the configurations of the heme propionate groups are not considered to be significant. These groups protrude into the solvent and interact only with solvent molecules in the crystals.

FERRIC SOYBEAN LEGHEMOGLOBIN a NICOTINATE was clear that the channel through which the probe left the protein is a second pathway by which ligands may enter. In fact, it corresponds to the alternative pathway previously identified in soybean Lb by Ollis et al. (1983) and in lupin Lb by Vainshtein et al. (1977). In soybean Lb a, the pathway passes between the side chains of AIaBC1, AlaC2, LeuC6 and GlnG3 (Fig. 11, lower part). 4.4. Hydrogen bonds at the Fe-binding groups The orientations of the Fe-binding groups on both sides of the heme are influenced by hydrogen bonds to the polypeptide. On the proximal side, the orientation of the imidazole ring of HisF7 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond from the N e l(imidazole) atom to the O(peptide) atom of LeuF3 (HisF7 N ~1...O LeuF3 = 2.6/2.4 A). (Here and elsewhere, two distances separated by a slash refer to the two independent molecules.) If the F helix were an ideal ~-helix, the O(peptide) atom of LeuF3 would be hydrogen bonded to N HisF7, but the interatomic distance is too long to be a hydrogen bond (LeuF3 O...N HisF7 = 3.7/3.9 ]~). The hydrogen bond from the N l(imidazole) atom of HisF7 to the O(peptide) atom of LeuF3 may affect dioxygen binding, since it restrains the imidazole ring of the proximal histidine towards the staggered configuration. The possible significance of this configuration in relation to dioxygen binding has been discussed in §4.2. Similar interactions have been observed in other hemoglobins, including sperm whale myoglobin (see, e.g., Phillips, 1980) and lupin Lb II (Harutyunyan et al., 1995). On the distal side of the heme, the carboxylate group of the nicotinate ligand interacts strongly with the imidazole group of the distal histidine HisE6 ( N i c O 1. · . N 61 HisE6 = 2.8/2.7 ]k). The effect of the interaction is to hold the side chain of HisE6 in the 'open' conformation noted earlier, i.e., rotated about C~---C/~ away from the Fe atom, as shown in Fig. 6. The interaction between the negatively charged nicotinate carboxylate group and the imidazole group of HisE6 can be described either as a salt bridge or as a hydrogen bond with a strong electrostatic component: since the pKa of HisE6 in ferric Lb a nicotinate is 7.7-8.3 (Trewhella, Appleby & Wright, 1986; Atanasov et al., 1989), it follows that the imidazole group is protonated under the conditions of X-ray data collection (pH 6.0). The nicotinate carboxylate group forms two other hydrogen bonds, one to the phenol O atom of TyrB9 (Nic 02.. .07 TyrB9 = 3.2/2.7 A), and the other to the heme-pocket water molecule (Nic 01. · .O H 2 0 = 3.2/3.2/~,). This water molecule in turn is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl O atom of the distal histidine (H20 O. · .O HisE6 = 2.6/2.5 A). 4.5. TyrB9: a functional role? The existence of a hydrogen bond between the nicotinate carboxyl group and the phenolic O atom of TyrB9 was predicted by Arutyunyan (1981), who noted that

imidazole ring rotates towards a staggered configuration (as in the Lb nicotinates). In comparison with Mb, the staggered configuration of the proximal histidine found in the present structure should make it easier for the imidazole group (and hence the Fe) to move towards the distal side when an exogenous ligand approaches, thus reducing the activation energy for ligation. In this regard, our description and conclusions concur with those of Harutyunyan et al. (1995). However, we note that the present work and previous reports of a staggered proximal histidine configuration refer to Lb derivatives with a 6-coordinate Fe atom: the exogenous ligand is already in place. The present work provides no new evidence concerning the type of torsional disorder said to occur in the 5-coordinate deoxyferrous form of lupin Lb (Harutyunyan et al., 1995). 4.3. Heme accessibility It is well known that the static X-ray structures of sperm whale Mb indicate no unhindered route of access for an 02 molecule to the distal side of the heme pocket (Case & Karplus, 1979; Kottalam & Case, 1988; Elber & Karplus, 1990). The passage of ligands between the solvent and the heme pocket relies on dynamic variations in the protein. A pathway beginning between HisE7 and ThrE10 has been proposed repeatedly. In complexes of Mb with bulky ligands such as alkyl isocyanides and imidazole, the side chain of HisE7 is in an 'open' conformation which should permit 02 to enter the heme pocket relatively freely. The same 'E7-E10' pathway is potentially available in soybean and lupin Lb's. However, to be consistent with the helix assignment in Fig. 2, the pathway in Lb's should be described as 'E6-E9': the residues in soybean Lb a which correspond to HisE7 and ThrE10 in Mb are HisE6 and LysE9. In soybean Lb a nicotinate the side chain of HisE6 is held in the 'open' conformation by the bulky nicotinate ligand (Fig. 6). If the model of the structure is modified by removing the nicotinate and solvent molecules from the heme pocket, and rotating the heme propionate-A to the proximal side of the heme, a 1.5/~ radius probe sphere can move between HisE6 and LysE9 from the solvent to the heme without experiencing steric hindrance from any non-H atom (Fig. 11, upper part).* During calculations of the distal heme cavity volume by the 'roiling sphere' method it was observed that a probe sphere can also escape from the protein through a gap between the BC junction and the FG loop.

* The orientation of the propionate-A side chain in Lb crystals is determined by intermolecular and solvent interactions. In the soybean Lb a nicotinate structure, the propionate side chain makes contact only with solvent atoms, and lies on the distal side of the heme. In seven of 11 lupin Lb structures, it lies on the proximal side. We conclude that the side chain is sufficiently flexible not to create a barrier against the E6-E9 pathway, and that, for the purposes of the rolling sphere calculation, it can be rotated out of the way.

PAUL J. ELLIS et al. such an interaction cannot occur in lupin Lb II where the residue corresponding to TyrB9 is a Phe. Details of the interaction between the nicotinate and TyrB9 are shown in Figs. 5 and 6. The location of TyrB9 in relation to the rest of the molecule can be seen in Fig. 4, where the phenolic side chain points towards the reader just above and behind the label 'E6'. The ability to form a tyrosine/nicotinate hydrogen bond explains why soybean Lb a and kidney bean Lb, which have a tyrosine at B9, have higher affinities for nicotinate than lupin Lb I, which (like lupin Lb II) has phenylalanine at B9. The relevant stability constants pKL at the acid limit are 8.55 (soybean), 6.50 (kidney bean) and 4.45 (lupin), respectively (Atanasov et al., 1989). While nicotinate is not a physiological ligand of leghemoglobin, a tyrosine which can form a hydrogen bond with nicotinate may well be able to interact with other Fe ligands. It is possible that this hydrogenbonding capability has a physiological significance. The hydrogen bond need not necessarily involve TyrB9: if PheCD3 in soybean Lb a were a tyrosine, its phenolic O °

atom would be just as favourably located for hydrogen bonding to the nicotinate carboxyl group as the O '~ atom of TyrB9 (Fig. 5). In a 1987 survey of 226 globin sequences, it was noted that only six have Tyr at the position corresponding to B9 in the present work, and only four have Tyr at a position corresponding to CD3 (Bashford et al., 1987). In a more recent survey of 22 plant hemoglobin sequences, Appleby (unpublished work) has observed that (i) the residues corresponding to B9 and CD3 are always Tyr or Phe; (ii) 12 sequences have Tyr at the residue corresponding to B9, and two more have Tyr at the residue corresponding to PheCD3; and (iii) no sequence has Tyr at both positions. Thus, the tendency of plant hemoglobins to have a Tyr residue within a hydrogen-bonding distance of a Fe-ligand appears to be above average. The speculation that a Tyr at B9 or CD3 may have a physiological role is supported by the recent observation that a hydrogen bond from TyrB9 stabilizes the hemebound dioxygen molecule in the oxy-hemoglobin of the nematode A s c a r i s s u u m (Yang, Kloek, Goldberg

On the other hand, TyrB9 in the present structure would have to move ,~3/~ closer to the heine if it were to interact with a ligand as small as dioxygen (the TyrB9 O r/.. -Fe distance is 8.8/~). Further, there appears to be no correlation between the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for ligand binding to plant hemoglobins listed by Gibson et al. (1989), and the presence or absence of Tyr residues at positions B9 and CD3. The possible significance of these observations remains to be explored.
