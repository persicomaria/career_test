The two sulfhydryl groups of ribosomal protein $1 from Eschmichia coli have been labeled with fluorescent maleimides and the distance between them has been determined by nonradiative energy transfer. This distance was found to be approximately 2'7 A for both free Sl and Sl bound to 30 S subunits. This value probably represents an upper limit. The position of the fluorescence emission maximum indicates that both sulfhydryl groups are in a relatively hydrophobic environment. When poly(U) is added to labeled Sl, either free or in 30 S subunits, the emission maximum shifts to the red by about 3 nm but without a detectable change in the interthiol distance. Sl labeled at one or both of its sulfhydryl groups retains most of its ability to enhance poly(U)directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. About the same concentration of poly(U) is required to give the maximum shift in fluorescence as is required to give maximum polyphenylalanine synthesis, indicating that Sl binds poly(U) during translation. The peptide initiation inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid almost completely quenches the fluorescence from either labeled sulfhydryl groups in Sl bound to ribosomes or free in solution. This quenching probably is due to energy transfer from the labeled sulfhydryls to bound aurintricarboxylic acid. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements indicated that the C-terminal domain of Sl is relatively rigid, but retains some independent movement when attached to ribosomes. The overall data are consistent with a model in which a region near the two sulfhydryl groups in the elongated C-terminal domain functions to sequester and bind mRNA to the ribosome during peptide synthesis.

Sl is the largest protein of the Escherichia cdi ribosome (1). It and its gene have been completely sequenced (2,3). The protein contains 557 amino acid residues (Sl from MRE 600) with a calculated molecular weight of 61,159. Physical studies (4-7) have shown that Sl free in solution is a

very elongated protein of about 230 A, approximately equal to the longest dimension of the ribosome. Neutron scattering measurements indicate that Sl has approximately the same length when bound to the 30 S subunit (8). S1 has been cross linked to S2, SlO, and S18 (9) as well as to the 3'terminal region of 16 S RNA (10,ll). There is some discrepancy in the assignment of the location of Sl in the ribosome by immunoelectronmicroscopy. In early studies, Lake (12) placed it at the distal edge of the platform and Stiiffler and his co-workers (13) found two sites, one on the head and the other on the large lobe of the 30 S subunit.

able with Sl bound to 30 S subunits, and the dissociation constant was estimated to be 3 to 5 X 10e7 M (5). However, Draper and von Hippel (14) determined the dissociation constant from 30 S subunits or 70 S ribosomes to be about 5 X lo-' M. Rychlik et al. (15) found Kd for labeled Sl from 30 S subunits to be below 4 X lo-' M. The amino terminal portion of Sl extending through residue 171 forms a discrete, trypsin-sensitive domain that functions in binding to ribosomes (16). Low-angle X-ray scattering data of the trypsin-resistant portion from residue 172 to the C-terminus of the protein indicates that this domain approximates a cylinder 200 A in length (Labischinski and Subramanian, unpublished work). Computer analysis of its amino acid sequence suggests a secondary structure that is rich in anti-parallel j3 sheets and /3 turns (3). The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of Sl is consistent with an unusual degree of structural flexibility within the intact protein (17), possibly resulting from flexibility between the N-terminal and Cterminal domains. The C-terminal domain contains the nucleic acid binding site or sites (16,18, 19) and two cysteine residues at positions 292 and 349. The thiol group of the latter but not the former can be readily alkylated by N-ethylmaleimide in the free, native protein (20). The more reactive thiol is alkylated on 30 S subunits (21), but becomes resistant to alkylation when poly(U) or other polynucleotides are bound to Sl (22, 23). A monoalkylated derivative can be formed by reaction of the group at position 349 under nondenaturing conditions (20). This derivative has been reported to have lost its ability to unwind double-stranded RNA (24), although it shows virtually complete activity in Q/3 replicase function (25) and in translation of poly(U) (7,26) and 50% activity in translation of MSZ-RNA (26). The precise role of Sl in protein synthesis has not been determined, but it has been shown to be essential for binding and translation of natural mRNA (27). It tightly binds RNA and is capable of unwinding double-stranded regions in RNA structure (23,28-30). There have been confliciting reports about the need for Sl in

binding of poly(U) to the 30 S subunit (31, 32); however, a dependence on the protein for efficient translation of poly(U) now is firmly established (7, 16, 26, 33, 34). The dependence on Sl is greatest with low concentrations of poly(U) but becomes progressively less with increasing amounts of the polynucleotide (26). The molar ratio of Sl per ribosome required for optimum translation of poly(U) is approximately one, with inhibition of polyphenylalanine synthesis observed at higher Sl concentrations under conditions of limiting
POIYW)

It was suggested (36) that the function of Sl is to hold the 3' end of 16 S RNA in an unpaired conformation accessible for binding to the Shine-Dalgarno (37) sequences of natural mRNA; however, this hypothesis does not explain why Sl is required for the translation of synthetic messengers such as poly(U). Other proposals for the function of Sl are that it binds mRNA directly (31) and that it affects the secondary structure of mRNA to allow it to bind to the 30 S subunit (38). Recently, it has been proposed that Sl functions to sequester mRNA for translation by binding to the elongated C-terminal domain (39). In this paper, we present results obtained using Sl in which one or both sulfhydryl groups have been labeled with fluorescent maleimide derivatives. The distance between sulfhydryl groups is estimated from nonradiative energy transfer and the interaction of nucleic acids with Sl free in solution or on ribosomes was studied. Fluorescence polarization data are consistent with the C-terminal RNA binding domain being a highly elongated, stiff rod that is partially but not completely immobilized upon binding to 30 S ribosomal subunits. The results are consistent with the model proposed previously (39).

ET AL. was eluted with a solution containing 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5) and 7 M urea. Sl eluted from the poly(U) column, although essentially free of other proteins, contains a significant amount of nucleic acid. To remove this material Sl was chromatographed on DE52 cellulose as described by Labischinski and Subramanian (6). The Sl eluted from the poly(U) column was dialyzed against 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) in 6 M urea and then was applied to a 2.5-ml(0.7 X 6.5 cm) DE52 column equilibrated with the same buffer. Sl was eluted from the DE52 column with a 40-ml linear KC1 gradient (0 to 200 miu KC1 in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 6 M urea). This fraction was (pH 7.0) and dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes-KOH stored at -80°C. The range of AdAm ratios for Sl preparations was 1.2 to 1.4. The latter value corresponds to about 0.75% nucleic acid, most of which appears to he poly(U) as judged by thin-layer chromatography of the nucleotides following alkaline hydrolysis. Only preparations with an A&A, ratio of about 1.4 were used for the work reported here. p&es. For Labeling of protein Sl with jbmresmt labeling the more reactive sulfhydryl of Sl with CPM, Sl in 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), at a concentration of about 2.5 mg/ml, was incubated with an equimolar amount of CPM (added from a concentrated stock solution in dimethylformamide) for 2 h at 0°C. The reaction was terminated by adding reduced glutathione to give a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated for 2 min at 37°C. The reaction mixture then was passed over a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated with 7~ guanidine-HCl, 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0). group If no labeling of the less reactive sulfhydryl was desired, the sample then was passed over a G75 column equilibrated with 7 M urea, 10 rnre HepesKOH (pH 7.5). Finally, the labeled Sl was dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) and stored at -30°C. In many cases, after labeling the more reactive sulfhydryl group with CPM, we desired to label the less reactive group with various maleimides in order to observe energy transfer between fluorophores attached to these two cysteine residues. For this labeling, the CPM-S1 eluted from the G-75 column 10 mM Hepesequilibrated with 7 M guanidine-HCl, KOH (pH 7.0) was incubated with the desired maleimide (DNAM, NEM, or BPM) at a concentration of 1.2 mM for 1 h at 22°C. After this incubation the sample was passed over a G-75 column equilibrated with 7 M urea, 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) and then dialyzed against 10 rnb! Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5). It was found necessary to include the intermediate 7 M urea step rather than changing the Sl environment directly from 7 M guanidine-HCl to Hepes buffer alone. Without the urea step some of the Sl precipitated and poor renaturation was achieved. In order to label only the less reactive sulfhydryl of Sl with CPM, the more reactive group was first blocked by reaction with NEM. Sl in 10 my HepesKOH (pH 7.5) was reacted with 2 mM NEM for 10

Preparation of ribommd s&units. The growth of E coli K12, strain A19, the subsequent isolation of ribosomes, and the preparation of ribosomal subunits were carried out as described previously (40). Preparations of Sl and Sl-&ficimt 30s subunits. Ribosomal protein Sl was isolated by the method of Subramanian et al. (19). About 190 nmol of 30 S subunits in 1 M NH&l, 26 mM Mg(OAc)s, 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5). and 5 mM BME was applied to a 30-ml (1.5 X 17 cm) poly(U)-Sepharose 6B column prepared from cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose by the method of Lindberg and Persson (41) and equilibrated with the same solution. All components of the 30 S particle except protein Sl pass through the column with little retardation. This eluate was used as a source of 3OS(-Sl) and was dialyzed against TMNSH solution before being stored at -80°C. Protein Sl binds to the poly(U) and thus is retained on the column. The column was washed with the buffer indicated above until the Am of the eluate was below 1.0. Then most of the remaining material was eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mM BME. Finally, Sl

min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding BME to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the reaction mixture was passed over a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated with 7 M guanidine-HCl, 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0). NEM-Sl from this procedure then was incubated with 1 mhb CPM for 18 h at 0°C and chromatographed again on G-75 equilibrated with `7 M urea, 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5). Finally, the sample was dialyzed against 10 rnrd Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5). The extent of labeling with CPM was estimated, using a determined molar extinction coefficient at 390 nm of 23,250 for CPM and the reported (32) molar extinction coefficient at 230 nm of 49,000 for Sl. The extinction coefficient of bound CPM was calculated from the observation that the absorbance of CPMSl in 10 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5) was 93% of that of CPM-S1 in 7 M guanidine-HCl, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and the assumption that the molar extinction in the latter solvent was the same as that of free CPM cysteine (calculated to be 25,000) in the same solvent. The Am was first corrected by subtracting the contribution due to CPM (0.3 X Am) before being used to calculate the Sl concentration. The extent of labeling of CPM-S1 with DNAM was determined from the calculated molar extinction coefficient of 15,400 at 353 nm, making the required corrections for the contribution of CPM to the Am and for the contribution of CPM and DNAM to the A,. Sl was labeled with IAEDANS as described by Chu and Cantor (42). Both sulfhydryl groups of Sl were labeled with iV-(3-pyrene)maleimide by incubation in 7 M guanidine-HCl, 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.0) with 1 mM N-(3-pyrene)maleimide for 2 h at 22"C, followed by passage through a column of G-75 Sephadex equilibrated with a solution containing 7 M urea and then dialysis as described above. Pm!einuse K treatment of CPM-Sl. Samples of CPMSl with and without energy acceptors were digested with proteinase K in order to eliminate any energy transfer and thus correct for differences in CPM concentration among the various samples. The proteinase K treatment consisted of incubation of the labeled Sl at a concentration of about 300 pg/ml with 50 pgg/ ml of proteinase K in TMNSH solution for 30 min at 37°C. It was determined that no further changes in fluorescence occurred on longer incubation or with the addition of more proteinase K. of tryptic peptides of Sl. In order to Preparation determine the specificity of labeling of Sl, labeled Sl was digested with trypsin and the resultant peptides were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The trypsin digestion consisted of an overnight incubation of about 0.5 mg/ml labeled Sl with 2 pg/ml trypsin in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 my CaClz, followed by another 2 &ml addition of trypsin and a further 6-h incubation at 37°C. The digested Sl then was analyzed directly by chromatography, as described in Figure 1.

Activity of lubeled 231. Activity of labeled Sl was determined by measuring stimulation of poly(U)-dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis using 3OS(-Sl) in combination with 50 S subunits. The polyphenylalanine assay was carried out as reported previously (40), with no preliminary incubation of Sl with 3OS(-Sl). In a total volume of 100 pl, generally 0.5 Azso units of 50 S ribosomal subunits were used with 0.25 Am units of 3OS(-Sl) subunits and all other components necessary, including 5 X lo- M [`%]Phe (5 Ci/mol) and the amount of Sl as indicated in the figure and table legends. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37'C, then processed as described (40) to determine the amount of polyphenylalanine synthesized. Recmstitutiun of SOS, u&g idated Sl and SOS(-Sl). For reconstituting labeled or unlabeled Sl into 30 S subunits, Sl at a concentration in the range of 5 X lo-' to 1 X 10d6 M was incubated with a twofold excess of 3OS(-Sl) (unless otherwise indicated) in TMNSH solution for 15 min at 37°C. In some cases the reconstituted 30 S was reisolated by sedimentation in the Spinco 50 Ti rotor at 49,000 rpm for 4 h. The 30 S pellet was resuspended in TMNSH solution. Approximately 90% of labeled Sl was found in the 30 S pellet. To form 70 S ribosomes, an equimolar amount of 50 S subunits was added to the reconstituted 30 S, the was raised to 12.5 mrd. and Mg(OAc)z concentration the sample was incubated an additional 5 min at 37°C. Fl~escence measurements Steady-state fluorescence measurements were taken with an SLM photoncounting spectrofluorimeter Model 3000 (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, Ill.). When spectra were taken, data were accumulated at 1-nm intervals with a scanning rate of 0.5 or 1.0 s per wavelength increment. Spectra were automatically corrected for the wavelength dependence of photomultiplier sensitivity. All fluorescence measurements were made at an absorbance of less than 0.1 at the excitation maxima. Quantum yield calculations were made as previously described (40), using as the standard quinine sulfate in 0.1 N H&IO,, which has a quantum yield of 0.7 (43). Steady-state fluorescence polarization measurements were made with the SLM fluorimeter with a vertically oriented polarizer in the excitation beam and a horizontally oriented polarizer in the emission beam. Quinine sulfate was used to correct for any difference in detector response to vertically and to horizontally polarized light. Energy transfer calculations were made as previously described (40) using fluorescence intensity measurements in the absence and presence of energy acceptor. As usual, &, is defined as the distance at which energy transfer is 50% efficient (44). Fluorescence lifetime and time-dependent fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made as described previously (45), using a single photon counting instrument. The excitation light was filtered through

Blanks containing all components except fluorescent label were measured for each sample and subtracted. Relaxation times, ro, defined as the time required for the anisotropy to decay to l/e times its original value, were obtained from semilogarithmic plots of anisotropy vs time, using a least-squares computer program. 7o values were calculated using all data points; however, for clarity only every fourth point is shown in Fig. `7. Since the lifetimes and relaxation times of the probes used were much larger than the duration of the light pulse, it was not necessary to deconvolute the decay curves. RESULTS

Labeling of Sl The procedure used here to measure the distance between the two sulfhydryl groups of Sl by nonradiative energy transfer involves labeling a portion of the more reactive sulfhydryl group with the energydonating fluorophore under limiting reaction conditions in the absence of denaturants, and then exhaustively labeling the remaining sulfhydryl residues with the energy acceptor in the presence of `7M guanidine-HCl. The first labeling reaction was carried out with the maleimide derivatives of various probes used in a low molar ratio with Sl at O"C, pH 7.0. Under similar reaction conditions Kolb et al. (24) found no detectable labeling of the less reactive sulfhydryl group with N-ethylmaleimide. Linde et al. (32) observed approximately a lo-fold difference in reactivity of the two sulfhydryl groups. We find no more than a trace of fluorophore associated with the tryptic peptide containing the less reactive cysteine following incubation of Sl with an equimolar amount of labeling reagent, in the range of 15-60 PM. The level of labeling of Sl under those conditions is about 0.4 mol label per mol Sl. Typical results are shown in Fig. 1. For these experiments Sl was labeled under nondenaturing conditions with 3-(4-maleimidylphenyl)-4methyl-`7-diethylaminocoumarin, CPM, and hydrolyzed with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by highperformance liquid chromatography. Only one fluorescent peak corresponding to the

About 40 pg of the tryptic digest then was applied to a pBondapak Cl8 column (3.9 X 30.0 mm, Waters Associates, Milford, Mass.) equilibrated with 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 3.0. The column was developed with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 26.7 to 66.7% in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 3.0. The flow rate was 2.0 ml/min and the total volume of the gradient was 60 ml. The column effluent was monitored continuously for absorbance at 210 nm. Fractions of 2 ml each were collected and their fluorescence was measured at 4'70 nm, exciting at 390 nm.

peptide containing the more reactive sulfhydryl was observed. To label the less reactive sulfhydryl specifically, the more reactive SH was completely blocked by reaction with N-ethylmaleimide under nondenaturing conditions as described under Experimental Procedures. Unreacted NEM was eliminated by reaction with BME and then the second thiol was labeled in the presence of guanidine-HCl. Analysis of a tryptic digest of Sl thus labeled with CPM is shown in Fig. 1. Only one fluorescent peak corresponding to the peptide with the less reactive sulfhydryl group was observed. The results in Fig. 1 also indicate that reaction of the maleimide derivatives with amino groups of Sl is minimal under the conditions used.

FIG. 2. Dependence of polyphenylalanine synthesized on amount of Sl added for unlabeled and labeled Sl. The assay for polyphenylalanine synthesis contained 30 pg/ml poly(U) and other components as described under Experimental Procedures, at the indicated ratio of Sl to 3OS(-Sl). Sl samples tested were unlabeled Sl (0), NEM,CPM-Sl (Cl), and CPM,NEM-Sl (A).

Activity of Labeled Sl The ability of Sl to promote polyphenylalanine synthesis by ribosomes was used as a measure of the biochemical activity of the protein following labeling. The effect of varying amounts of labeled and unlabeled Sl on polyphenylalanine synthesis by Sl-deficient ribosomes is shown in Fig. 2. Addition of unlabeled Sl to 3OS(-Sl) in a molar ratio of about 0.8 causes a near maximum increase in polyphenylalanine synthesis of about 2.5-fold. Polyphenylalanine synthesis occurring in the absence of added Sl and maximum activity at a molar ratio of 0.8 rather than 1.0 probably reflect residual Sl in the ribosomes and in the enzyme fraction used as a source of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and peptide elongation factors. Figure 2 also shows the activity of Sl with both of its thiol groups blocked with CPM or NEM. For these experiments the more reactive thiol was reacted with either CPM or NEM under nondenaturing conditions, and then the less reactive thiol was alkylated with the other reagent under denaturing conditions.

Note. The assay is described under Experimental Procedures. Where it was possible to make a determination from absorbance measurements, Sl was estimated to contain about two maleimides per molecule. This presumably would also be the case for samples that could not be estimated by absorbance, since the labeling conditions were the same. CPM(only)-Sl contained about 0.4 CPM/Sl. Native 30 S ribosomes containing Sl gave 275 pmol of polymerized phenylalanine. A blank value of 190 pmol for 30 S lacking Sl was subtracted for each sample.

ence was detected between the unlabeled protein and Sl reacted first with NEM and then with CPM. However, Sl reacted first with CPM and then with NEM was somewhat less active, suggesting that the relatively large coumarin ring structure of CPM may interfere with Sl function when it is linked to the more reactive thiol. The activity of Sl labeled first with CPM and then with other probes on the less reactive thiol group is given in Table I. In all cases the activity is only slightly lower than that shown in Fig. 2 for CPM,NEM-Sl. These results show that Sl labeled at one or both of its cysteine residues is able to function in translation of poly(U). Lower activity

Spectral Properties of Labeled Sl The spectral characteristics of free Sl labeled first with CPM and then with other probes under denaturing conditions are shown in Table II. In all cases the environmentally sensitive emission of the coumarin moiety indicates that it is in a hydrophobic environment in Sl. In water the adduct formed by reaction of cysteine with CPM has an emission maximum at 486 nm and a quantum yield of 0.31. The corresponding values in 95% ethanol are 470 nm

The relative fluorescence intensity of CPM(only)-Sl has been arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.00 for each of the solutions.

Also, with the exception of the NEM derivative, probed linked to the less reactive thiol group cause a 3- to 5-nm blueshift in the fluorescence of CPM attached to the first thiol group. This indicates that fluorophore on the second thiol can detectably affect the environment of CPM on the first thiol. Table II also shows that addition of 3OS(-Sl) or 3OS(-Sl) + 50s has no detectable effect on either the emission maximum or fluorescence intensity of CPM-Sl. Centrifugation experiments have shown that, under these conditions, CPM-S1 is bound to 30 S or 70 S, respectively (data not shown). Thus the lack of effect of the ribosome on the fluorescence of Sl is conTABLE

sistent with the hypothesis considered below that this region of Sl is not in direct contact with the ribosome.

The results of energy transfer measurements are shown in Table III. A 67% reduction in CPM fluorescence was observed when the less reactive thiol was labeled with DNAM. The R0 from CPM to DNAM pair is about 30 A. Thus the energy transfer observed corresponds to a calculated distance between the donor and acceptor probes of about 27 A. Limits on this value due to uncertainty in the orientation factor, K', were estimated to be 23 and 30 A by the fluorescence depolarization method of Haas et al. (46). Energy transfer was not observed under denaturing conditions, e.g., in 7 M guanidine-HCl. No apparent energy

a The CPM derivative of the more reactive sulfhydryl was used as the energy donor in all cases. All samples were in TMNSH. bFor measuring polarization of the donor, CPM, excitation was at 390 nm and emission was at 470 nm. The polarization of the donor with no acceptor was 0.188 for free Sl and 0.226 for Sl bound to 30 S. `The half-height limits are determined as the full width at half-height of the function Q(r'/r), which is the apparent distribution of distances between donor and acceptor due to uncertainty in the value of K', the orientation factor, as estimated from polarization data by the method of Haas et al (46); r' is the distance between the donor-acceptor pair assuming r? = 2/3, and r is the actual distance. For the nonfluorescent acceptor, we have assumed complete rigidity in calculation the half-height limits, so that the actual range is in all likelihood less than that given. d The apparent energy transfer was calculated as the percentage decrease in fluorescence intensity of CPMlabeled Sl in the presence of the various acceptors compared to that of CPM-labeled Sl in the absence of acceptors. Corrections were made for differences in concentration of the various samples by digestion with proteinase K as described under Experimental Procedures. `No significant energy transfer.

transfer from CPM was observed when the second thiol was labeled with either NEM or BPM, which do not absorb photons over the region of CPM fluorescence. These results, particularly with the benzophenone derivative, suggest that the observed decrease in fluorescence is due to energy transfer rather than to a perturbation in the local environment of the coumarin caused by the second probe. Binding of labeled Sl to 30 S ribosomal subunits caused no detectable change in the amount of energy transfer observed. This is consistent with the model considered below in which the region of the C-terminal domain containing the cysteine residues is involved in binding of mRNA and does not interact directly with other components of the small ribosomal subunit. We suspect that the actual distance between the thiols may be less than 27 A. Small amounts of the CPM derivative that are not paired with an energy acceptor might arise from a number of sources. These include incomplete labeling with the second probe, reaction of the unreactive thiol with CPM, spurious labeling with CPM, and traces of CPM-glutathione adduct that were not removed from the sample. In addition, the apparent distance might be increased in denatured or partially degraded Sl. Although each of these potential sources of error was checked, in the aggregate they might lead to a significant underestimation of energy transfer. For this reason we recommend that the calculated 27-A distance between the probes be taken as a tentative upper limit. Binding of Polg(U) and S&unit to Sl

3OS(-Sl) + 50s than when the labeled Sl is free in solution. The spectral data indicate that poly(U) is bound to Sl at or close to the region containing the two cysteine residues, and that this binding is not eliminated in the presence of 70 S ribosomes. It has been shown previously that poly(U) bound to Sl prevents the reaction with NEM (23). Centrifugation experiments indicate that Sl is bound to `70 S ribosomes and sediments with them in the presence of poly(U) (data not shown). The data of Fig. 4 demonstrate that about the same amount of poly(U) is required for polyphenylalanine synthesis and change in fluorescence. The half maximum and maximum effects are given at 8 and 20 pg/ml, respectively, in the assay system used. Considered together, these results support the hypothesis that mRNA is bound to Sl in the region of its two cysteine residues during the course of peptide elongation. Eflect of Binding RNA and Antibiotics to Lubeled Sl on Riboscmzes The effect on fluorescence of binding deacylated tRNA or N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA to the ribosomal P site or Phe-tRNA into the A site with EF-Tu and GTP was tested. There was no detectable difference in fluorescence from CPM,NEM-Sl under these conditions (data not shown). Also, the effect of adding various antibiotics to ribosomes undergoing polyphenylalanine synthesis was examined. In these experiments first N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA was bound nonenzymatically to the ribosome, followed by addition of all components required for polyphenylalanine synthesis. After 3 min at 3'7°C either kirromycin, fusidic acid, sparsomycin, erythromycin, or thiostrepton was added, each to a final concentration of 2 X lop4 M. After an additional incubation of 5 min at 3'7°C the samples were cooled on ice and their emission spectra were taken. All samples gave virtually identical spectra (data not shown). Differences in the environment of Sl and the coumarin probe of Sl, if any, were not detected. Dissociation of poly(U) from Sl or even a

The data in Table II show that binding of poly(U) to CPM-S1 causes a marked red shift and 15% decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield. This effect of poly(U) is shown more clearly in Fig. 3. Fluorescence of CPM,NEM-Sl is shifted by poly(U) to the same extent in the presence or absence of 3OS(-Sl) + 50s. However, fluorescence from NEM,CPM-Sl is quenched and shifted less by poly(U) in the presence of

fluorescence by ATA indicates that the ATA binding site and probably the poly(U) binding site of Sl are near the fluorescent probes linked to its sulfhydryl groups. The observation that fluorescence from probes on either sulfhydryl group is quenched is an additional indication that the two groups are in close proximity. It is likely that the quenching of fluorescence from labeled Sl by ATA is due to energy transfer. ATA has a broad absorption spectrum, in the range 400-600 nm, which overlaps with the emission spectrum of coumarin. An &, of about 28 A was calculated for energy transfer from coumarin to monomeric ATA. However, Gonzalez et al. (49) have concluded that polymers of ATA are the active components, the monomer being virtually inactive. If polymers of ATA were the actual ligands, then the effective & value would be higher but an exact value cannot be calculated without knowing the actual size of the polymer. In view of the inhibition of poly(U) binding by ATA, the effect of poly(U) on the quenching of fluorescence from CPM,NEMSl by ATA was tested, with the results shown in Fig. 6. If poly(U) was added first, there was a definite decrease in the amount of quenching given by the subsequent addition of subsaturating amounts of ATA

(Fig. 6A). Analysis of the data (Fig. 6B) indicates that the presence of 80 fig/ml of poly(U) raises the apparent dissociation constant of ATA about threefold. Higher concentrations of poly(U) do not increase the apparent dissociation constant (data not shown). For Fig. 6, the concentrations of ATA were calculated assuming it to be monomeric. If the effective species were polymeric their concentrations would be lower, and a significant portion of the total would be bound. In this case the free ATA concentration might be much lower than shown. Also, there is some question about the reversibility of ATA binding since, if ATA is added first, poly(U) shows virtually no ability to reverse the quenching of fluorescence (data not shown). Despite the uncertainty regarding the mechanism, it is clear that prebound poly(U) interferes with subsequent binding of ATA. Much larger amounts of ATA are required to quench the fluorescence of labeled Sl when it is incorporated into the 30 S ribosomal subunit. One possibility is that 3OS(-Sl) and ATA are in direct competition for Sl. If this were true, a saturating amount of ATA should cause dissociation of the Sl from the 30 S. Accordingly, 30 S subunits with bound, labeled Sl were incubated with 5 X lop4 M ATA in the pres-

ence and absence of 50 S subunits and in the presence and absence of poly(U). After a 5-min incubation at 37"C, the ribosomes were collected by centrifugation and the pellets were examined for Sl by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis, along with control samples containing no ATA. All pellets showed virtually the same amount of Sl, indicating that ATA had caused little if any dissociation of Sl from the ribosome. The pellets with ATA were intensely colored, indicating that the ribosome had bound much more ATA than would result from the ATA bound to an equimolar amount of Sl. Prebinding of poly(U) to the ribosomes containing Sl increased the amount of ATA required to give half-maximum quenching of fluorescence by about threefold, as was observed with free Sl. These results show that ATA does not cause dissociation of Sl from 30 S subunits. The increased amount of ATA required in the presence of 30 S subunits apparently reflects multiple ATA binding sites on ribosomes. Considered together, these data for Sl free in solution or bound to 30 S subunits suggest that binding of ATA to Sl may account for or contribute to its inhibitory effect on peptide initiation.

In view of the unusual length of Sl, i.e., 230 A or greater (39), knowledge of its flexibility both free in solution and attached to ribosomes is important for understanding its structure and function. Time-resolved anisotropy of a pyrene-Sl derivative was used to study this characteristic, with the results shown in Fig. `7. The pyrenemaleimide derivative was chosen because of its relatively long fluorescence lifetimes, about 20 and 100 ns (50). The data of Fig. 7A are typical for Sl free in TMNSH solution and give rotational correlation times, 7D, of 8.8 and 51 ns with relative weights of 0.38 and 0.61, respectively. The shorter time likely reflects local movement of the probe itself and/or artifacts such as might be generated by error in the value for scattered excitation light that was subtracted. It is not considered further. The longer 7D value, 51 ns, is likely to reflect

depolarization generated by movement of the body of the Sl molecule. The extreme spread of comparable values for 70 from six determinations with different preparations of pyrene-Sl was 40 and 59 ns, with most values being near 50 ns. With a solution molecular weight of 61,159 (2,3) for Sl, a partial specific volume of 0.74 cm3 gm-' (39), and assuming a typical hydration of 0.32 g HzO/g protein, the following conclusions can be reached. It can be calculated that, if Sl were spherical, a 7Dvalue of 26.9 would be anticipated (51). However, Sl is a highly elongated protein.

C-terminal end at position 557. The NMR spectrum of Sl indicates that it has more structural flexibility than anticipated for an average globular protein (17). The fluorescence anisotropy data presented here indicate a rotational correlation time for Sl free in solution of about 50 ns. A value of 53.8 ns would be anticipated for a protein of M, 61,119 which formed a rigid rod of 20 X 230 A. These data appear to be consistent with an Sl structure in which a relatively rigid, 200 X 20-A, C-terminal, rod-shaped domain is attached to a more globular domain at the NHz-terminus of the molecule, with a limited degree of flexibility between the two domains. When attached to ribosomes, the rotational correlation time of Sl is increased to about 200 ns whereas a rotational correlation time of more than 500 ns is anticipated for the ribosomes themselves. These results indicate that the rotational freedom of the C-terminal domain is reduced when Sl binds to ribosomes, but that it retains some degree of independent mobility. They are consistent with a model of Sl in which the NH,-terminal domain is fixed to the ribosome but the rod-shaped C-terminal domain is connected to the NH2-terminal domain and hence to the 30 S subunit via a partially flexible hinge region of the molecule. Our data, however, indicate considerably less flexibility of both free and ribosome-bound Sl than has been reported by other workers (42, 54).

These results are consistent with the previously suggested (39) model for Sl diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 8. In this model Sl is attached to the 30 S ribosomal subunit by the NH,-terminal, globular domain with the rod-shaped, C-terminal domain free to interact with mRNA. In this configuration, and in consideration of results from many other laboratories, it appears that Sl may function to sequester mRNA for the ribosome, and, in addition, possibly to reduce secondary structure within the mRNA segment that is to enter the decoding center of the 30 S ribosomal subunit.
