Background: Cyclophilin (CyP) is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that binds the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA). CyP-CsA forms a ternary complex with calcineurin and thereby inhibits T-cell activation. CyP also has enzymatic activity, catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl amide bonds. Results: We have determined the structure of human cyclophilin A (CyPA) complexed with CsA to 2.1 A resolution. We also report here the structure of CyPA complexed with an analog of CsA, N-methyl-4-[(E)2-butenyll]-4,4-dimethylthreonine CsA (MeBm 2tl-CsA), which binds less well to CyPA, but has increased immunosuppressive activity. Comparison of these structures with previously determined structures of unligated CyPA and CyPA complexed with a candidate substrate for the isomerase activity, the dipeptide AlaPro, reveals

that subtle conformational changes occur in both CsA and CyPA on complex formation. Conclusions: MeBm 2tl-CsA binds to CyPA in an essentially similar manner to CsA. The 100-fold weaker affinity of its binding may be attributable to the close contact between MeBmtl and the active site residue Ala103 of CyPA, which causes small conformational changes in both protein and drug. One change, the slight movement of MeLeu6 in CsA relative to MeBm 2tlCsA, may be at least partially responsible for the higher affinity of the CyPA-MeBm 2tl-CsA complex for calcineurin. Our comparison between CyPA-CsA and CyPA-AlaPro suggests that CsA is probably not an analog of the natural substrate, confirming that the catalytic activity of CyPA is not related to its role in immunosuppression either structurally or functionally.

Introduction
Cyclophilin (CyP) is a binding protein for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA, Fig. 1) [1] and also a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) catalyzing the cis transisomerization of peptidyl-prolyl amide bonds [2,3]. Isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl amide bonds is a slow step in protein folding [4]. Cyclophilin has been found to affect the folding of several proteins in vitro, including collagen or procollagen [5-7], chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 [8], carbonic anhydrase II [9,10], and ribonuclease [11-13], and it is therefore considered to be a chaperone helping with protein folding [10,14]. For example, the proper synthesis and transport of Drosophilarhodopsins is blocked by mutations in the ninaA gene [ 15,16], a fly homolog of cyclophilin, implying that the ninaA cyclophilin may stabilize and transport proteins to their proper intracellular locations. Recently, it has been reported that cyclophilins A and B bind to HIV-1 Gag protein [17] and cyclophilin C (CyPC) binds to its potential natural cellular protein, cyclophilin C-associated protein [18].

The complex of cyclophilin with cyclosporin A mediates the immunosuppessive action of CsA on T-cell activation. The CyP-CsA complex binds in vitro to calcineurin [19], a serine/threonine phosphatase and a Ca 2 +-dependent calmodulin binding protein [20]. The phosphatase activity of calcineurin is inhibited by the CyP-CsA complex, but not by CyP or CsA alone [21-24]. The CsA analog, N-methyl-4-[(E)-2-butenyl]4,4-dimethylthreonine CsA (MeBm 2tl-CsA), is of special interest for the design of new immunosuppressive drugs because of its unusual properties. It binds weakly in a binary complex with CyP but is a strong immunosuppressant [25], and it binds tightly in the ternary complex of CsA-CyP-calcineurin [21]. All immunophilins have both peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization and immunosuppressant binding activity [26]. How, or whether, the two functions are related is of considerable medical interest. It has now been shown that the active site mutants of human CyPA that lack PPIase activity still inhibit calcineurin in the presence of CsA [27].

The three-dimensional structures have been determined for the unligated recombinant human CyPA [28,29], human CyPA complexed with a tetrapeptide [30] or the dipeptide AlaPro [31], the CyPA-CsA complex [32,33], and murine CyPC complexed with CsA [34]. We describe here the structure determination of CyPA complexed with CsA and its derivative MeBm 2 tlCsA at 2.1 A resolution. The two complexes reveal subtle conformational changes that may account for the weak binding of MeBm 2tl-CsA to CyP and its ability to form a CyPA complex that binds tightly to calcineurin, and thus potently block signal transduction [21]. These structures may provide useful information for the design of new immunosuppressive drugs. Comparison of the CyPA-CsA structure with the unligated CyPA and the CyP-AlaPro complex suggests that CsA is unlikely to be an analog of the substrate, in contrast with the transition state analog hypothesis [35].

Results and discussion
The decameric CyPA-CsA structure Ten molecules of the CyPA-CsA complex in the crystallographic asymmetric unit aggregate into a decamer which has an almost perfect 52 molecular symmetry (Fig. 2). Two pentamers of CyPA-CsA complexes with their CsAs facing each other, form a CyPA-CsACsA-CyPA sandwich. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between CsA and CsA, CyPA and CyPA, and CyPA and CsA contribute to the formation of the decamer. Each pentamer is internally tied together by five intermolecular hydrogen bonds or salt links between Metl and Gly59, Lys28 and Glu120, and Glu34 and Arg148 (Table 1, Fig. 3a). Interactions between the two pentamers are dominated by five hydrogen bonds or salt links between Lys31 and Glu81, Tyr79 and Glu81, and Lys82 and Glu84 (Table 1, Fig. 3b).

Only hydrogen bonds or charge-charge interactions are listed. The symmetry-related interactions, such as Glu81:N to Tyr79:0 and Tyr79:0 to Glu81 :N were treated as the same one because of the 52 symmetry of the CyPA-CsA complex. The values in parentheses are standard deviations.

Our CyPA-CsA structure is very similar to the decamer sandwich recently reported by another group [32] although the two crystals were grown under totally different crystallization conditions and have different space groups - P2 1 versus P4 32 12 [36]. In addition, most hydrogen bonds within the decamer are common between the monoclinic and tetragonal structures, indicating that the different crystallization conditions do not change the packing of CyPA-CsA. However, some minor differences in the interactions were observed between the two crystal forms. For example, Arg148 formed a charge-charge interaction with Glu34 in our 2.1 A resolution structure (Table 1), but with Glu43 in the 2.8A resolution structure [32]; and the hydrogen bond between Metl N and Gly59 O was not reported

in the previous CyPA-CsA structure [32]. Since Metl and the side chain of Argl48 were partially disordered, we do not think that the differences are significant. CsA binding The individual CyPA-CsA molecule is an eight-stranded -barrel, as previously revealed ih the unligated or substrate-complexed CyPA structures [28,30]. CsA binds with a 1:1 stoichiometry to CyPA (Fig. 4). Six residues of CsA, MeBmtl, Abu2, Sar3, MeLeu9, MeLeulO, and MeValll (see Fig. 1) interact with hydrophilic or hydrophobic residues at the active site of CyPA, confirming the results of various approaches [28,30,32,33,35,37-39]. In addition, this refinement at 2.15A resolution revealed that the side chain of Val5 of CsA is within van der Waals distance (3.5 to 4.0A) of the side chain of Arg55 of CyPA. Residues of CyPA involved in the interactions with CsA include Arg55, Phe60O, Met61l, Gln63, Gly72, AlalOl, Asn102, Ala103, Glnlll, Phell3, Trpl21, Leu122 and His126. Five hydrogen bonds are formed between CsA and CyPA (see Table 2). Two water molecules are consistently found in each of the 10 molecules of CyPA-CsA, one of which is bound to MeBmtl O of CsA and to Gln63 NE2 and His54 NE2 of CyPA, and another which interacts with Sar3 0 of CsA and indirectly with CyPA via a bound water (Table 2). A water molecule binds to Val5 N of seven molecules of CsA in the CyPA-CsA decamer and has high B-factors in the range 40-70A2. In addition to binding at the active site of CyPA, CsA also interacts with neighboring molecules of CyPA within the decamer. Inter-pentamer hydrogen bonds are formed between Ala7 0 of CsA and Glu81 OE1 of CyPA, and residues Thr73 and Ala103 of CyPA from the opposite pentamer are located within a 4A radius of the atoms of Sar3 to Ala7 of CsA (Table 2). Within the pentamers, residues of Metl, Pro30, Lys31, and Tyr79

of CyPA form van der Waals contacts with Ala7, D-Ala8 and MeLeu9 of CsA. Two CsAs, coming from each of the opposing pentamers, are in side-by-side contact mediated by the backbones of Abu2, Sar3 and MeLeu4 (Table 2, Fig. 4). The interactions between CsA and CyPA, mapped in various ways [32,33,35,37-39] have yielded similar overall results which differ slightly in the details. First, the hydrogen bond between Gln63 Ne2 of CyPA and MeBmtl O of CsA was not observed in the NMR structure [33], but was seen in the X-ray structures at 2.8A [32] and 2.1 A resolution (this work). Second, a hydrogen bond between Ala7 0 of CsA and Lys31 N5 of a neighboring CyPA was reported in the 2.8A resolution structure [32], but was unlikely in our 2.1 A structure since the average distance between these residues in the 10 molecules was 3.6A. Third, only one hydrogen bond between MeLeulO of CsA and Arg55 of CyPA was identified by the NMR or previous X-ray studies [32,33], but two were seen in our 2.1 A resolution CyPA-CsA structure (Table 2). Overall, the above differences may reflect the limits of the method and the resolution. Therefore, the current high-resolution structure of CyPA-CsA provides details of the interactions that clarify the ambiguities of CsA binding. CsA conformation All peptide bonds of the bound CsA have the trans conformation in the structures of CyPA-CsA and CyPAMeBm 2tl -CsA. The transpeptide bonds were reported for CsA when bound to CyPA in solution [40-42] or to an Fab fragment in the crystal state [43], in contrast to the cis conformation in the free state [44]. One intramolecular hydrogen bond between the side chain hydroxyl group of MeBmtl and the carbonyl oxygen of MeLeu4 is observed by both NMR and X-ray studies

of bound CsA (this work and [32,33]) (Fig. 5). This corrects docking models in which the MeBmtl hydroxyl was proposed to form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of AsnlO2 of CyPA [37,38]. In contrast, CsA in the free state has three intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the backbone nitrogens and carbonyl oxygens. The rearrangement of the intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the conformational difference between the unbound and bound CsA may result from the different solvent systems used for the structure determina-

tions; unbound CsA was determined in a hydrophobic solvent whereas bound CsA was determined in aqueous solution. Alternatively, this difference may reflect the conformational change when CsA binds to CyP, as proposed from the observation that several conformations of a water-soluble CsA derivative slowly interconvert in aqueous solution [33]. There is no detailed comparison of the conformations of bound CsA in solution or in the crystalline state

Glu81 is not an active site residue, but forms a hydrogen bond with CsAo in the oDDosin2 Dentamer. r----rr

although the structures of CsA complexed with CyPs or an Fab fragment have been determined by NMR or X-ray studies [32-34,41-43]. The backbone conformational angles of the bound CsA were reported based on the early NMR structure df human CyPA-CsA [42]. However, this result showed significant differences from the X-ray structure of murine CyPC-CsA in the backbone conformations of some of CsA residues such as MeBmtl and MeLeu4 [34]. In addition, the NMR studies from two research groups showed different conformations for the side chain of MeBmtl of CsA [41,42]. To establish whether the above differences represent multiple conformations of CsA, the bound CsA was compared with the recently refined structures of the CyPA-CsA complexes from the X-ray and NMR studies. A comparison of the backbone conformation of CsA showed mean and maximum differences of 6° and 200 and of 40 and 14' between the X-ray structures of murine CyPC-CsA [34] and human CyPA-CsA at 2.8A and 2.1 A resolution, respectively (M Walkinshaw, personal communication, and this work). When the Xray structure of CyPA-CsA is compared with the NMR structure, conformational differences of a mean 8 and a maximum 19 ° are observed (Table 3, Fig. 5). These data show that the CsA conformation is essentially the same when it binds to CyPs in solution or in the crystalline state (Fig. 5). The small differences between the CsA conformations in solution and the crystal may be due to the resolution limits of the methods. Structure of CyPA-MeBm 2tl-CsA Among 61 derivatives of CsA, MeBm 2tl-CsA uniquely showed - 100-fold weaker binding to CyPA than the native CsA, but three-fold stronger immunosuppression in the T-cell assays [25]. Further experiments

revealed that the CyPA-MeBm 2 tl-CsA complex had about three-fold tighter binding to calcineurin relative to the native CsA-CyPA complex [21]. These differences in the binding properties resulting from the introduction of a single carbon atom at the Cy of the MeBmtl side chain, led to a proposal that CsA might change conformation when the CyP-CsA complex binds to calcineurin [45]. The structure of CyPA complexed with MeBm 2tl-CsA is isomorphous to that of CyPA-CsA, as shown by a scaling R-factor of 14.4 % and a correlation coefficient of 96.6 % between the two data sets to 2.1 A resolution, as well as by the small average displacements (0.11 A for Cac atoms and 0.22A for all atoms) between the two structures (Fig. 6). The Fo-Fc map calculated from the CyPA-MeBm 2tl-CsA structure, in which the methyl group of MeBm 2tl was omitted, showed a unique peak of electron density (about 8c) for the methyl group (Fig. 7), verifying the good occupancy of the methyl group. The backbone conformation of MeBm 2tl-CsA is the same as the native CsA while the side chains of MeBm 2tl, MeLeu6, and MeLeulO have small positional displacements or conformational changes, as revealed by the overlay of CsA on MeBm 2tl-CsA (Fig. 7). The side chains of both MeBmtl and MeBm 2tl are flexible with the last two X angles of their side chains exhibiting a standard deviation as large as 16 ° (Table 4). This is not surprising because the hydrophobic side chains of MeBmtl and MeBm 2tl do not interact with CyPA. The superposition of MeBm 2tl-CsA over CsA (Fig. 7) revealed that the differences of the X1 and x2 dihedral angles between MeBmtl and MeBm 2tl were five to nine times greater than their standard deviations (Table 4), implying a possible conformational

change induced by introduction of the extra methyl group at MeBmtl. In addition, slight movement of the loop around Ala103 of CyPA away from the side chain of MeBmtl was observed as a 0.28A displacement of the Ca atom of AlaO13 by comparison with the average displacement of .11A for all Ca atoms or of <0.1A for the Ca atoms of the other 12 CsA binding residues (Fig. 6). Comparison of the X-ray and NMR data implies that the crystal structure is an accurate reflection of the binding of CsA in solution. Therefore, the small but significant conformational changes of MeBm 2tl-CsA and CyP should be responsible for the observed kinetic effects. The subtle conformational changes of the side chains of MeBm 2tl and the positional displacement of Ala103 of CyPA imply that MeBm 2tl-CsA does not naturally fit the binding site and may thus account for the 100-fold weaker binding of MeBm 2tl-CsA relative to native CsA. MeLeu6, which has no interactions with CyPA, shows significant changes in its side chain and a Ca displacement of 0.3A when the structures of CyPA-CsA and CyPA-MeBm 2tl-CsA are compared. This latter displacement is about three-fold greater than the average (0.11A) for all Ca atoms of CyPA-CsA. Although it is not yet clear whether the subtle changes in the Ca position and the side chain conformation of MeLeu6 are a consequence of the introduction of the methyl group at Cy of MeBmtl, they are probably related to the compensating increase in calcineurin binding seen with the CyPA-MeBm 2 tl-CsA complex. This is consistent with an experiment in which mutation of MeLeu6 to MeAla6 decreased its binding to calcineurin by three orders of magnitude [21]. Superposition of CyPA-CsA and CyP-AlaPro The superposition of CyPA-CsA on the unligated CyPA or CyPA-AlaPro revealed little change in the molecular conformation of CyPA upon binding of AlaPro or CsA.

Clearly, the conformation of the backbone atoms as well as several of the side chains of CsA are very similar. The differences in some side chains may reflect

the limits of the methods or resolution.

Residue Aspl3 which is about 23 A away from the nearest atom of CsA has the largest displacement. However, the significance of this displacement is unclear.

The average displacements were 0.24A for Coa atoms and 0.47 A for all atoms between CyPA-CsA and the unligated CyPA, 0.38A and 0.54A between the unligated CyPA and CyP-AlaPro, and 0.40 A and 0.64A between CyPA-CsA and CyPA-AlaPro (Fig. 8). The structural comparison also showed that the CsA-binding residues have similar side chain conformations among the three structures and smaller positional displacements than the average for all atoms of the protein. On the other hand, the structural superposition revealed that AlaPro was not directly comparable with CsA. The proline side chain of AlaPro occupies the

same hydrophobic pocket as the side chain of MeVall 1 of CsA (Fig. 9) and its polypeptide backbone -C-N- occupies approximately the same position as -Ca-C- of MeValll, but their polypeptide chains run in opposite directions, as previously noted for the bound tetrapeptide [32,33]. The -Ca-C- bond of CsA is unlikely to substitute for the peptidyl-propyl amide bond because of their different chemical natures, in conflict with the proposal that CsA mimics a transition state of the PPIase reaction [33,35]. Moreover, the hydrogen-bonding pattern of CsA is completely different from that of AlaPro. The carbonyl oxygen of the amide bond of AlaPro forms a strong hydrophilic interaction with the back-

Finally, the solvent coordinations at the active site are different in the two structures. Six out of eight active site water molecules observed in the CyPA-AlaPro structure [31] were displaced following the binding of CsA to CyPA, including all three water molecules that bind directly to AlaPro [31]. Attention had previously been drawn to the question of whether the isomerase activity of immunophilin is essential for the immunosuppression of T-cell activation since cyclophilins and FKBPs (the fungal immunosuppressant FK506 binding proteins) have entirely different amino acid sequences and three dimensional structures yet common functions i.e. binding to immunosuppressants and catalyzing peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization. Several observations have revealed that inhibition of PPIase activity is insufficient to suppress T-cell activation. First, the synthetic compound 506BD, an analog of the binding domain shared by FK506 and rapamycin, blocked the PPIase activity of FKBP and the immunosuppressive effect of both FK506 and rapamycin, but did not inhibit FK506- or rapamycinsensitive signaling pathways [46]. Second, several CsA derivatives were shown to have much weaker immunosuppressive activity than expected on the basis of their ability to bind tightly to CyP [25]. Third, mutations of the active site residues of CyPA abolish the isomerase activity, yet retain the ability to inhibit calcineurin, the downstream receptor for the immunosuppressants [19,27,47]. Our crystallographic studies reveal that the binding of CsA is structurally unrelated to the binding of AlaPro, supporting the argument that immunosuppression and PPIase activity are two unrelated functions of immunophilins. a previously-determined structure of CyPA complexed to a candidate substrate, AlaPro, shows that, while both ligands bind in the same pocket, they do not bind in the same orientation nor make the-same contacts with CyPA. Therefore, it seems unlikely that CsA acts as a substrate analog; instead, it is probably a simple competitive inhibitor. Thus CyPA's ability to bind to CsA is structurally as well as functionally unrelated to its isomerase activity. The coincidence in function between CyPA and FKBP remains inexplicable. Although CsA is a powerful immunosuppressant, more potent analogs are being sought. The CsA derivative studied in this paper, MeBm 2 tl-CsA, binds less well to CyPA, yet the drug-isomerase complex is approximately 100 times more effective at inhibiting calcineurin activity than CsA-CyPA. The differences between the two complexes are surprisingly small; subtle conformational changes in CsA, particularly MeLeu6, may be all that are required for more effective binding of the composite surface formed by the drug and CyPA to calcineurin. This level of molecular definition of one side of the key ternary complex should be helpful in the design of yet more effective immunosuppressive drugs.

Materials and methods Crystallization and X-ray data collection Recombinant human CyPA was purified as previously described
[48]. CsA was kindly provided by Sandoz Pharma LTD, Switzerland. MeBm 2 tl-CsA was synthesized as described [49]. Co-crys-

tals of the CyPA-CsA complex were grown by a two-step procedure: (1) mixing the 16mgml-1 CyPA protein solution from the purification with 10 mM CsA/ethanol in a molecular ratio of 1:2 overnight and (2) crystallizing 13mgml-1 of the complex by dialysis against a buffer containing 20mM Tris-base, 2mM
dithiothreitol, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM NaN 3, 9 % polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 10% ethanol, 2% isopropanol, 0.3M (NH 4 )2SO0 , 4 and 0.1 mM CsA pH8.5 at 4°C. The crystal is a rectangular bar with a typical size of 0.2 x 0.3 x 1.0 mm 3. The space group is P21 with cell parameters of a = 72.6 A, b = 160.9 A, c = 95.3 A, and

Biological implications The powerful immunosuppressive drugs, cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 each bind to peptidylprolyl cis-transisomerases [cyclophilin (CyP) and FK binding protein (FKBP), respectively]. In both cases, the complex of drug and immunophilin binds to calcineurin, a calcium-activated phosphatase that is essential for T-cell signaling. Since the target proteins are not related either in sequence or structure, it has been suggested that isomerase function may be related to the immunosuppressive activity. However, several lines of evidence suggest that isomerase function per se is not required. Our comparison of a high-resolution structure of the CyPA-CsA complex with

3= 90.6°. Ten molecules of the CyPA-CsA complex exist in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected on the Rigaku phosphate image plate system at the University of North Carolina. A total of 341 591 measurements was reduced to 106646 symmetry-independent reflections with an Rmerge of 0.063. The data set is 89.1 % complete to 2.15A resolution and 84.6 % reflections have intensity stronger than 2 (I/a).
Co-crystals of CyPA complexed with MeBm 2tl-CsA were obtained in a similar way to CyPA-CsA, except that MeBm 2tlCsA was used instead of CsA, and the conditions of the second step were altered with respect to PEG (13%) and (NH 4)2S04 (0.32 M). The space group is P21 with cell parameters of a = 72.6 A,b = 160.6 A,c = 95.3 A,and 3= 90.9° . A total of 278 912 measurements collected from three crystals was reduced to 99207 symmetry independent reflections with an Rmerge of

Structure refinement and solution
Several data sets of heavy atom derivatives were collected for CyPA-CsA. However, none of them provided useful phase information for the determination of the CyPA-CsA structure due to problems of non-isomorphism and low occupancy of the heavy atoms in the large asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using a model containing the unligated CyPA [28] and CsA which was docked from the superposition of the CyPC-CsA structure [34] over the unligated CyPA structure. Tests on the cross-rotation function using the data from several resolution shells showed that the best result was obtained with the data between 4 and 6 resolution. All subsequent trials of the rotation/translation search were carried out using the 4-6 A dataset. This was crucial for distinguishing peaks from noise and thus for solving the CyPA-CsA structure. The peaks are predicted to be weak from the molecular replacement using one tenth of the molecules as the initial model. The cross-rotation function of the CCP4 package [SERC (UK) Collaborative Computer Project 4, Daresbury Laboratory, UK, 1979] revealed four strong peaks (Table 5). The best solution (o= 138.8 ° , = - 152.5° , X= 145.4 °) from the CCP4 cross-rotation was input into the program X-PLOR [50] for the translational search, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.092 for the strongest peak (Table 6). As expected, this value is small because only one tenth of the molecules were used in the calculation of the coefficient. Nevertheless, it was substantially better than the second peak (0.076), and thus a positive indication of the right location of the first molecule. This was confirmed by the observation that the distance of a mercury site to the sulfur atom of Cys52 (a major residue for binding mercury) was 3.5A based on the difference Patterson map between the methyl HgC1 derivative and the native crystal.

aThe orientation angles are defined in the polar spherical system. bRotation function (RF) in Patterson space was calculated using the reflections at 6 to 4A resolution; 4149 for the cross-rotation and 12 896 for the self-rotation. In the self-rotation, the origin peak has a height of 50.

The self-rotation function of the CCP4 program revealed seven strong peaks (Table 5). These seven peaks had an approximate value of X = 180° or X= n x 72 ° in the polar spherical system, implying that they may represent two-fold or five-fold local molecu-

lar symmetry. Seven molecules were then generated by applying the seven local symmetries to the first molecule which had been located by the cross-rotation and translation functions. A translational search was independently carried out for each of the seven molecules (Table 6). The first five molecules had reasonable correlation coefficients (0.07 to 0.12) while the last two were poor. [After the structure was solved, the translation function for the last two solutions was re-examined by using another choice of the rotations which had the Eulerian angles of the same a, the supplimentary Ip,and the opposite y (CCP4 convention), or the polar angles of (w = 97.6° , 4 = 180.0° , X= 154.1°) (equivalent to solution 6 in Table 5), and (o= 120.8° , 4 = - 80.0°, X = 147.1°) (equivalent to solution 7). These two molecules had correlation coefficients of 0.08 and 0.09, and were shown to be the correct solutions.] Paired with the first molecule which served as the origin fixing molecule, each of the five molecules which were output from the individual translation was further searched for the translation along the Y axis and for the origin in the X and Z dimensions. The correlation coefficients from the two-molecule translational search were in the range 0.15-0.18A (Table 6), about 5 % better than the second-best solution. The correct location of the six molecules was confirmed by their favorable interactions as displayed on an Evans and Sutherland ESV10 graphics workstation. These six molecules were refined by X-PLOR [50] as the rigid-bodies to an R-factor of 0.426 against the 41742 reflections between 10 and 3A resolution. The spatial arrangement of the six molecules clearly revealed that the 10 molecules of CyPA-CsA in the crystallographic asymmtric unit aggregate into two pentamers and have 52 symmetry. Thus, the remaining four molecules of CyPA-CsA were generated from the 52 symmetry using one CyPA-CsA as the model and combined with the six molecules of CyPA-CsA from the rigid-body refinement to form a decamer of CyPA-CsA. The decameric CyPA-CsA was then

Cyclophilin-cyclosporin complexes Ke et al.
refined as the rigid-bodies to an R-factor of 0.332 against 70 592 reflections between 10 and 2.5A resolution. Without constraint of the 52 molecular symmetry, the positional and B-factor refinement on the individual atoms by X-PLOR reduced the R-factor to 0.270 against 70 592 reflections at 2.5 A resolution. The electron density map from the above model was excellent and was not further improved by the non-crystallographic symmetry averaging or the solvent flattening. Throughout the model building and refinement procedures, each molecule of the decameric CyPA-CsA was individually rebuilt by the program FRODO [51] linked to the ESV10 graphics system, and refined without restraint of the non-crystallographic symmetry by X-PLOR versions 3.0 or 3.1 [50] which were installed in the Decstation 5000 and Iris Indigo computers, respectively. After the decameric CyPA-CsA was refined to an R-factor of 0.235 against 104 889 reflections between 10 and 2.1 A resolution, water molecules were picked up from the Fo-F c map and incorporated into the refinement. The water molecules, which have relatively high B-factors, were deleted after each cycle of refinement and new waters were picked up from the Fo-F c map. This procedure, water-picking, refining and deleting, was repeated until there were no peaks stronger than 3.5a in the F-F c map. The structure of CyPA-CsA, which includes 10 molecules of CyPA and CsA (a total of 1760 amino acids) and 637 water molecules in the asymmetric unit, was finally refined to an R-factor of 0.170 against 100 595 reflections at 6.0 to 2.15 A resolution. The root mean square (rms) errors from the ideal values were 0.011A and 2.68 ° for bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. Using the partially refined structure of CyPA-CsA as the initial model, the structure of CyPA-MeBm 2tl-CsA was refined as the rigid-bodies to an R-factor of 0.231 at 10-3 A resolution. The final structure of CyPA-MeBm 2tl-CsA, which was rebuilt and refined following a similar protocol to that of the CyPA-CsA structure, includes 10 molecules of CyPA and MeBm2tl-CsA and 677 water molecules, and has an R-factor of 0.184 against 93 418 reflections at 60 to 2.1 A resolution. The rmis errors from ideal values were 0.011 A and 2.69 for bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. The coordinates of the structures of CyPA-CsA and CyPAMeBm 2 tl-CsA have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry names RMA and 1RMB, respectively), from which copies will be available one year after this paper is published.
