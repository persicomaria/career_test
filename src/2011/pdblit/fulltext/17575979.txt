Abstract The binding of several different categories of small molecules to bovine (BSA) and human (HSA) serum albumins has been studied for many years through different spectroscopic techniques to elucidate details of the protein structure and binding mechanism. In this work we present the results of the study of the interactions of BSA and HSA with the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cationic cethyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and zwitterionic N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3ammonium-1-propanesulfonate (HPS) monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy of the intrinsic tryptophans at pH 5.0. Similarly to pH 7.0 and 9.0, at low concentrations, the interaction of BSA with these surfactants shows a quenching of fluorescence with Stern^Volmer quenching constants of (1.1 þ 0.1)U104 M31 , (3.2 þ 0.1)U103 M31 and (2.1 þ 0.1)U103 M31 for SDS, HPS and CTAC, respectively, which are associated to the `effective' association constants to the protein. On the interaction of these surfactants with HSA, an opposite effect was observed as compared to BSA, i.e., an enhancement of fluorescence takes place. For both proteins, at low surfactant concentrations, a positive cooperativity was observed and the Hill plot model was used to estimate the number of surfactant binding sites, as well as the association constants of the surfactants to the proteins. It is worthy of notice that the binding constants for the surfactants at pH 5.0 are lower as compared to pH 7.0 and 9.0. This is probably due to fact that the protein at this acid pH is quite compact reducing the accessibility of the surfactants to the hydrophobic cavities in the binding sites. The interaction of myristic acid with both proteins shows a similar fluorescence behaviour, suggesting that the mechanism of the interaction is the same. Recently published crystallographic studies of HSA^myristate complex were used to perform a modelling study with the aim to explain the fluorescence results. The crystallographic structure reveals that a total of five myristic acid molecules are asymmetrically bound in the macromolecule. Three of these sites correspond to higher affinity ones and correlate with high association constants described in the literature. Our models for BSA and HSA with bound SDS suggest that the surfactant could be bound at the same sites as those reported in the crystal structure for the fatty acid. The differences in tryptophan vicinity upon surfactant binding are explored in the models in order to explain the observed spectroscopic changes. For BSA the quenching is due to a direct contact of a surfactant molecule with the indole of W131 residue. It is clear that the binding site in BSA which is very close, in contact with tryptophan W131 , corresponds to a lower affinity site, explaining the lower binding constants obtained from fluorescence studies. In the case of HSA the enhancement of fluorescence is due to the removal of static quenching of W214 residue in the intact protein caused by nearby residues in the vicinity of this tryptophan. ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Serum albumins have been one of the most studied proteins for many years [1,2]. They are the most abundant of the proteins in blood plasma, accounting for about 60% of the total protein corresponding to a concentration of 42 g/l [1,2] and provide about 80% of the osmotic pressure of blood [1]. Albumins have been used as a model protein for many and diverse biophysical, biochemical and physicochemical studies [2]. These proteins have the interesting properties of binding a variety of hydrophobic ligands such as fatty acids, lysolecithin, bilirubin, warfarin, tryptophan, steroids, anaesthetics and several dyes [2,4^8]. They play an important role in the transport and deposition of a variety of endogenous and exogenous substances in blood [9] due to the existence of a limited number of binding regions of very di¡erent speci¢city [10]. Their primary structure is constituted by a single chain of about 580 amino acid residues [1]. Their secondary structure is formed by 67% of K helix of six turns and 17 disul¢de bridges [6]. The three-dimensional structure of human serum albumin (HSA) was determined by X-ray crystallography [2,3] and it is composed by three domains I, II and III which confer to the protein a heart shaped molecule form [3]. Each domain is constituted by two subdomains, named IAB, IC, IIAB, IIC, IIIAB, IIIC, respectively [2,5]. The subdomains share a number of common features, such as the hydrophobic face, the cluster of basic amino acid residues, and proline residues at the tips of the long loops. However, it is known that each subdomain is also unique and probably exhibits a certain degree of binding speci¢city [1,3,5]. In fact, in the domain I ligands such as long chain fatty acids, indole derivatives, several dyes, drugs, compounds with alicyclic ring structures, copper and nickel are bound [1,2,5]. This site is also called the warfarin binding site [10].The domain II, also called indole or benzodiazepine binding site, presents the binding site for bilirubin, short chain fatty acids, several dyes, indole derivatives and steroids. In the domain III indole derivatives, diazepam, longchain fatty acids and other drugs are bound [1^6].

The bovine albumin (BSA) presents 76% sequence identity with the human albumin (HSA) [2,5]. From the spectroscopic point of view one of the main differences between the two proteins is that BSA has two tryptophan residues (W131 and W214 ) while HSA has only one (W214 ). The additional tryptophan residue in BSA is buried in a hydrophobic pocket, and it has been proposed to lie near the surface of the albumin molecule in the second K helix of the ¢rst domain [2]. Several studies on bovine (BSA) and human (HSA) serum albumins involving binding of small molecules, particularly fatty acids and surfactants, based on di¡erent spectroscopic techniques have been reported [8,11^14]; when these molecules bind to a globular protein, the intramolecular forces responsible for maintaining the secondary structure can be altered, producing conformational changes in the protein [16]. Characterization of these changes at atomic resolution has been possible based on recent work published by Curry et al. [4]. In this work the crystal structure of HSA with several bound myristic acid î molecules has been described at 2.5 A resolution. Further detailed studies by this group have demonstrated that these conformational changes involve substantial rotations of domains I and III relative to the domain II [17] and appear to be primarily driven by fatty acid binding to the site located at the contact of subdomains IIA and IIB. The authors have been able to assess the highest a¤nity fatty acid sites in the HSA structure based on available literature experimental data on binding and compare them with modelled fragments of BSA. Further, Curry et al. [18] reported recently that while the global changes in domain orientation are quite dramatic, the local e¡ects of fatty acid binding on the protein are more subtle. They also studied the binding sites for fatty acids of di¡erent chain length in order to gain further information on fatty acid^albumin interactions. The binding of long-chain n-alkyl sulfates to BSA [12] and n-alkyl p-aminobenzoates to HSA [13] has been also reported using other methods and these studies have shown that the binding sites are hetero-

geneous relative to their binding energies. This ¢nding is in good agreement with the recent work using single crystals [4,17,18]. Recently, a £uorescence study on interaction of both BSA and HSA at pH 7.0 and 9.0 with anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), zwitterionic N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonium-1-propanesulfonate (HPS) and cationic cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) was published and the binding constants of the surfactants to the proteins were reported [19]. The spectroscopic changes were di¡erent for BSA and HSA, suggesting the distinct e¡ects of detergent molecules binding on W131 and W214 neighbourhoods. In the present work, results of the spectroscopic study of these proteins with the cited ionic surfactants at pH 5.0 are reported and comparisons with the results at pH 7.0 and 9.0 were included [19]. Going to pH 5.0 one would expect to enhance the surfactant electrostatic interactions with the protein from one hand, and from the other hand the more compact albumin structure at this pH would eventually a¡ect the accessibility of binding sites. Further, modelling of the surfactant binding is discussed and compared with available literature binding data from previous studies. A modelling study was also performed which lead to a proposal of possible models for both BSA and HSA complexed with the ionic surfactants based on the high homology between the two proteins. These models were developed with the aim to describe the e¡ect of these surfactants in the intrinsic protein £uorescence emission upon binding. The rationalization of the £uorescence data is presented based on considerations of the expected changes in the vicinity of tryptophan W131 (BSA) and W214 (BSA and HSA) residues, as described by the protein^surfactant models. 2. Materials and methods BSA, HSA, SDS, HPS were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., CTAC was from Aldrich and sodium acetate was from Mallinckrodt. The protein concentrations were determined from the optical density of appropriate solutions in a Hitachi U2000 Spectrophotometer, using the extinction coe¤cient at 280 nm of 44720 M31 cm31 for BSA and 35700

M31 cm31 for HSA [2] at pH 7.0. A maximum optical density value of around 0.07 at 295 nm was used to avoid the inner ¢lter e¡ect, corresponding to a protein concentration of 10 WM. Measurements of steady-state £uorescence were performed in acetate bu¡er 20 mM at pH 5.0, with excitation wavelength at 295 nm in a Hitachi F4500 spectro£uorimeter. The emission spectra were obtained in the range of 305^ 450 nm and the total areas were used to assess the £uorescence changes induced by the surfactants. Fluorescence quenching was treated by Stern^Volmer equation [20]. The set of £uorescence emission spectra were deconvoluted through the CCA method [21] and from the fractions of bound surfactant, the Hill plot model was used to estimate the number of binding sites, the cooperativity coe¤cient and the association constants [22] through the equation: Gvf  nKSnH 1  KSnH 1

where n is the number of binding sites, nH is the cooperativity coe¤cient and K is the binding constant of surfactant to the protein. This same approach was previously used in the analysis of data at pH 7.0 and 9.0 [19]. In the present work we also use an alternative approach to treat the data from the CCA analysis based on the simpler equilibrium involving the binding of n surfactant molecules to one protein molecule under the assumption that this binding is independent (which means that nH = 1). Considering this simple equilibrium P  nLIPLn 2 where P is the protein, L the surfactant, and n the number of surfactant molecules per protein. The fraction of unbound protein f can be expressed by the equation f  1 1  KLn 3

where K is the binding (association) constant. [L] in this equation should be the free ligand concentration but in our analysis it was approximated by the total added ligand concentration. For higher ligand concentrations, in excess of available speci¢c protein binding sites, this approximation is valid. For small ligand concentrations, comparable to the number of binding sites, it is not as appropriate since the ligand

87

is almost completely bound and so the free ligand concentration is signi¢cantly lower than the total added one. This makes the binding constant to be strongly underestimated, approaching eventually the value for the lower a¤nity sites. In this model the constant K is the product of the association constants for the individual steps in the consecutive binding of each surfactant. In order to be able to make comparisons of binding for the di¡erent surfactants as well as at di¡erent pH values, average association constants were obtained from the nth root of K, so that the dimension of the average constant KP is M31 : p n KH  K 4 The building of the main chain and side chains for the complex (protein^surfactant) models was based on the crystal structure of the human serum albumin complexed with myristic acid, extracted from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB) identi¢ed as 1BJ5 [4], and the building of the main chain and side chains for the unliganded BSA model was based on the crystal structure of the HSA obtained also from PDB identi¢ed as 1AO6 [23], both structures were î solved at 2.5 A resolution. The construction of the three-dimensional model for bovine albumin complexed with the surfactants SDS, HPS and CTAC molecules was performed following ¢ve basic steps as follows: (1) establishing a sequence alignment for BSA and HSA; (2) molecular modelling of BSA; (3) modelling of the SDS molecules and the reconstruction of the side chain coordinates for the W131 residue; (4) resolution of problems of steric hindrance generated in the previous step; (5) model evaluation. The modelling was performed by satisfaction of spatial restraints with the MODELLER 4.0 program [24], on Silicon Graphics IRIX 5.3 workstations. The sequence alignment between BSA and HSA was performed using the MULTALIGN program of the AMPS package [25]. The modelling of the BSA with SDS, HPS and CTAC molecules and of the HSA with SDS were performed using the myristic acid coordinates reported in the 1BJ5 structure data [4], maintaining the common hydrophobic core of the fatty acid molecule and performing several dihedral torsions in order to obtain an initial structure with low steric hin-

drance and reasonable electrostatic energy. For W131 residue, an appropriate rotamer was chosen in which the interaction with the hydrophobic terminal from the neighbour surfactant molecule was improved. After the modelling of the surfactant molecules and of the W131 side chain, the energy of the complex was minimized at various stages employing the AMBER force ¢eld [26], with the steepest minimization algorithm and the solvent implicitly modelled by a distance-dependent dielectric constant (D = 4r) until stereochemical and packing parameters failed to give further improvement. Initially, only the surfactant and the W131 coordinates were maintained free for a ¢rst energy minimization, and afterwards the overall model was maintained free, ¢nishing the optimization procedure. During the modelling process and after the ¢nal minimization, the models were periodically evaluated for their stereochemical quality and the normality of their residue interactions and atomic contacts. The stereochemistry of the structures was evaluated with the PROCHECK program [27]. Residue environment analysis was performed with the VERIFY_3D program, which uses an implementation of the algorithm of Luthi et al. [28]. Atomic contacts were as« sessed with the QUALTY option of the WHATIF program [29]. The tryptophans accessible areas were determined using the ACCESS option of the WHATIF program [29]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Fluorescence spectroscopy 3.1.1. Steady state £uorescence 3.1.1.1. BSA. Titration of BSA and HSA solutions in acetate bu¡er at pH 5.0 with SDS, HPS and CTAC were performed adding aliquots of the surfactant stock concentrated solutions directly to the cuvette and the £uorescence emission spectra were registered after each surfactant addition. The titration of BSA with SDS shows a strong quenching of £uorescence to 55^60% of the initial value up to 0.1 mM of surfactant, which corresponds to 10 SDS molecules per protein molecule, with a Stern^Volmer quenching constant of 1.1U104 M31 . Similarly to

emission spectra are shown and the spectra of the pure components are shown in the Fig. 2B. Similarly to what is observed at pH 7.0 [19], the ¢rst one, centred at 342 nm was associated to native BSA. The second species, centred at 325 nm was associated to BSA^SDS complex predominant in the SDS range 0.1^2 mM SDS. The third species, centred at 326 nm

what occurs at pH 7.0, the quantum yield shows a slight enhancement up to 2 mM, which corresponds to a ratio SDS/BSA of 200. Above 2 mM SDS, the quantum yield decreases to 30% of the initial one, being constant up to 10 mM SDS (Fig. 1A). The maximum of emission wavelength shifts from 342 þ 1 nm to 326 þ 1 nm when the surfactant is added to the protein solution, indicating the presence of at least two di¡erent species in solution. The CCA method was applied for the whole set of emission spectra, and a reasonable analysis was reached only with the assumption of three species. In Fig. 2A these

was associated to a partially denatured BSA and it is the unique species remaining at 10 mM SDS. The titration with HPS shows that at initial surfactant concentrations, the quenching of £uorescence occurs according to two di¡erent processes (Fig. 1B). In the ¢rst one, a decrease in the quantum yield to 80% of the initial value up to 0.1 mM, corresponding to a ratio HPS/BSA of 10, with a Stern^Volmer quenching constant of (3.2 þ 0.1)U103 M31 . In the second process, the quantum yield decreases to 65% of the initial value up to 0.8 mM, corresponding to a ratio HPS/BSA of 80, with a Stern^Volmer quenching constant of (3.5 þ 0.1)U102 M31 . This would suggest that at pH 5.0 and low concentrations of HPS at least two di¡erent binding sites are present. The CCA method applied to the whole set of emission spectra also revealed the existence of three different species in solution (data not shown). The ¢rst one, centred at 342 nm was associated to native BSA. The second one, centred at 333 nm was associated to BSA^HPS complex which exists in the range of 0.5^ 1.0 mM HPS. The third species, centred at 331 nm, was associated to partially denatured BSA. When CTAC is added to the BSA solution (Fig. 1C), a decrease in the quantum yield to 55% of the initial one is observed up to 0.1 mM, which corresponds to a ratio of CTAC/BSA of 10, with a Stern^ Volmer quenching constant of (2.1 þ 0.1)U103 M31 . All the constants are collected in Table 1. The £uorescence shows a minimum at 0.5 mM CTAC and 55% of the initial one, and above 2 mM CTAC the £uorescence recovers to 85% of the initial. Similar to SDS and HPS, the CCA method revealed the existence of three di¡erent species (data not shown): the ¢rst one, centred at 342 nm was associated to native BSA; the second one, centred at 333 nm, was associated to a CTAC^BSA complex which exists in the

maximum amount in the range 0.2^0.8 mM of CTAC, corresponding to a ratio of CTAC/BSA of 20^80. The third species, centred at 332 nm, was associated to partially denatured BSA. It is worth of notice that the binding constants for the three surfactants at pH 5.0 are smaller by an order of magnitude (SDS) and a factor of 4^5 (HPS and CTAC) as compared to pH 7.0 [19]. One possible explanation for this result is that at pH 5.0 the protein is packed in a more compact form (pH 5.0 is close to the isoelectric point) and this reduces the accessibility of the hydrophobic cavities to accommodate the surfactants. The analysis of the emission spectra by the CCA method allowed to calculate the number of surfactant molecules bound per protein at the initial surfactant concentrations as described in detail in [19]. This is performed using the fractions of bound surfactant in the protein^surfactant complex from the data presented in Fig. 2C corresponding to the open circles and using the respective protein and surfactant concentrations. The obtained values were used to ¢t the experimental data from the Hill equation (Eq. 1). In Fig. 3, the ¢ttings are presented at pH 5.0 and the parameters obtained for the best ¢t are shown in Table 2. The parameters obtained from the ¢ts show clearly that there is a strong correlation among them, especially in the case of n and K, where an increase or decrease of the value of one of them in£uences signi¢cantly the value of the other one in the opposite direction. For this reason, the absolute values in Table 2 are not very signi¢cant per se and only a comparison of these values as a function of pH or protein origin (human or bovine) should be considered. Despite the existence of statistical problems in these ¢ts, it is interesting to notice also the existence of a positive cooperativity on binding of surfactant molecules. The analysis of analogous data show in the case of SDS and CTAC, smaller n values and cooperativity coe¤cients about 2-times as compared to those obtained at pH 7.0 and 9.0, and in the case of HPS, these values are the same as those obtained at pH 7.0 and 9.0 [19]. It should also be noticed that previous work on binding of laurate to HSA [30] has suggested a stoichiometric binding model involving several sequential binding steps, each one with a characteristic binding constant. These authors have obtained a good ¢t of the bind-

ing isotherm for laurate using ten steps with their respective binding constants. The molecular origin of all these constants was not, of course, known at that time since the model is independent of any assumption about the binding sites and also due to the lack of crystal structure information regarding HSA, which only very recently became available. Nevertheless, an interesting ¢nding was that the ¢rst binding constant was 8.31U106 M31 while the second binding constant was 1.67U106 M31 , also implying a negative cooperativity on binding. In that work the authors measured the free and bound ligand concentrations through equilibrium dialysis experiments. The analysis of the £uorescence data obtained by the CCA method was also performed in the limits of the simpler model described in Section 2, which assumes independent binding of surfactants, lack of cooperativity (nH = 1), and giving as parameters a

binding constant K and the number of surfactant molecules, n, bound to the protein. An average association constant K is obtained from Eq. 4 which can be compared for di¡erent surfactants and pHs (Table 2). In this case, the data for the fraction of free native protein as in Fig. 2C (open squares) are ¢tted to Eq. 3. In Fig. 4 several ¢ts to this model are presented for the used surfactants. It is seen that, in general, the number of bound surfactant molecules varies between 0.6 (one) and 2.6 (three) and the changes in the average association constants suggest that hydrophobic interaction is the driving force for binding. At pH 7.0 and for BSA the association constants obtained by the two di¡erent analyses are quite close, the main di¡erence being the presence

or lack of cooperativity, and the corresponding number of surfactant molecules bound, much smaller for the simpler model. 3.1.1.2. HSA. When the surfactants are added to HSA an opposite e¡ect in the £uorescence is observed as compared to BSA. In the titration of HSA with SDS, a 1.7-fold enhancement of £uorescence is observed up to 0.1 mM SDS concentration, which corresponds to a ratio of SDS/HSA of 10. The maximum enhancement occurs at 0.5 mM SDS and above 1.5 mM SDS, the quantum yield decreases to 60% of the initial value and remains constant up to 10 mM of surfactant (Fig. 5A). A shift of the maximum emission wavelength from 336 þ 1 nm to 327 þ 1 nm in the presence of the surfactants suggests the existence of di¡erent species in solution. The CCA method applied to these data reveals the existence of three di¡erent species. The ¢rst one, centred at 336 nm, was associated to native HSA. The second one, centred at 326 nm, was associated to a HSA^SDS complex and exists in the maximum amount in the range 0.1^2 mM SDS that corresponds to a ratio SDS/HSA of 10^200. The third species, centred at 327 nm was associated to a partially denatured HSA and it is the predominant species above 5 mM SDS. In the titration with HPS a 1.6-fold enhancement of the £uorescence is observed up to 4 mM HPS concentration which corresponds to a ratio HPS/ HSA of 400, remaining constant above 4 mM HPS (Fig. 5B). The CCA method applied to this set of £uorescence emission spectra reveals the existence of three di¡erent species (data not shown). The ¢rst species centred at 336 nm was associated to native HSA. The second species centred at 335 nm was associated to a HSA^HPS complex and exists in the maximum amount in the range 0.5^1.0 mM HPS that corresponds to a ratio of HPS/HSA of 50^100. The third species centred at 335 nm was associated to a partially denatured HSA and it is the predominant species above 5 mM HPS. In the titration of HSA with CTAC the enhancement of £uorescence occurs in two steps. In the ¢rst one a 1.2-fold enhancement in the quantum yield is veri¢ed up to 0.01 mM CTAC which corresponds to a ratio of CTAC/HSA of 1, and in the second one a 2.5-fold enhancement of £uorescence is observed up

to 4 mM CTAC, which corresponds to a ratio CTAC/HSA of 400, remaining constant above 4 mM CTAC (Fig. 5C). The CCA method applied to this set of emission spectra reveals the existence of three di¡erent species (data not shown). The ¢rst one centred at 336 nm was associated to native HSA. The second one centred at 333 nm was associated to a HSA^CTAC complex and exists in the maximum amount in the range 0.3^1.0 mM CTAC that corresponds to a ratio of CTAC/HSA of 30^100. The third species centred at 336 nm was associated to a partially denatured HSA and it is the predominant species above 5 mM CTAC. It is interesting to notice that in the interaction of both proteins with the surfactants the best ¢t for the

whole set of emission spectra is obtained using the model with three species and for HSA, the expanded initial region of surfactant concentrations shows a sigmoidal ¢tting, characteristic of cooperative interactions. The binding constants of the surfactants to the proteins obtained by the direct ¢tting of steadystate £uorescence titrations are presented in Table 1. It is also important to notice that similarly to what occurs at pH 7.0, these values have a considerable error and evidentiate that the cooperativity numbers n are highly correlated to the binding constant values. Although the average constant obtained from the simple model gives comparable values at some examples, here again a correlation between n and K values precludes a more quantitative and meaningful analysis. The Hill model was used to ¢t the data from the results of CCA method at low surfactant to estimate the number of binding sites, the cooperativity and the binding constants of the surfactants to the proteins. These values are presented in Table 2. A similar analysis as that made for BSA shows that in the interaction of HSA with SDS, a smaller value of n and a 2-fold enhancement in the cooperativity coef¢cient was veri¢ed as compared to the values obtained at pH 7.0 and 9.0 [19]. An analysis of data obtained by the CCA method was also made using the simpler model described by Eq. 4. In the case of HSA at pH 7.0 the constants for SDS and HPS are similar also, but for CTAC it is a factor of 6 higher as calculated in the simpler model. The number of binding sites is signi¢cantly lower in the simple model. At pH 5.0, the di¡erences in both binding constants and number of bound surfactant molecules are greater. In fact, the simpler model gives parameters for all three surfactants that do not have a simple trend which could be compared to the Hill model. 3.1.2. Fluorescence lifetime Fluorescence lifetimes were estimated both for BSA and HSA from the £uorescence decays. For both proteins a biexponential decay was observed with two nanosecond lifetimes, 7.2 and 4.4 ns for BSA, and 6.4 and 3.3 ns for HSA (Table 3) [19]. So, independently of the presence of two tryptophan residues (BSA) or a single one (HSA) the £uorescence decays are characterized by two long nanosec-

ond lifetimes. Interestingly, the e¡ect of addition of SDS for both proteins was quite similar, showing the quenching of both lifetimes as a function of the increase in surfactant concentration. In Table 3 the £uorescence lifetimes are shown for both HSA and BSA in the absence of SDS and in the presence of three surfactant concentrations. Above 2 mM of surfactant the lifetimes remain unchanged as compared to the values at 2 mM. The Stern^Volmer collisional quenching constants for HSA and BSA were similar: for HSA they were (1.1 þ 0.1)U103 M31 and (1.4 þ 0.3)U103 M31 for d1 and d2 , while for BSA they were (2.3 þ 1.4)U103 M31 and (1.4 þ 0.1)U103 M31 . In the case of BSA these constants were signi¢cantly lower than the steadystate one of the order of 105 M31 [19]. The results for time-resolved £uorescence suggest that the enhancement of steady-state £uorescence observed for HSA is entirely based on the removal of some static quenching of W214 residue which is present in the native protein. It is interesting that in a recent paper by Flora et al. [31] using acrylodan-labelled HSA the authors have shown that upon denaturation by guanidine the tryptophan £uorescence also increased due to a reduction of energy transfer from tryptophan in domain II to acrylodan

bound to Cys-34 in domain I. In the case of BSA also a considerable fraction of the quenching is associated with a static mechanism promoted by the surfactant in the vicinity of W131 residue. 3.2. Modelling In a similar way as observed during the titration of BSA and HSA with myristic acid at pH 7.0, a quenching of £uorescence is observed for BSA and an enhancement of £uorescence is observed for HSA, similar to the e¡ect of the surfactants. These results suggest that the binding mechanism for both SDS and myristic acid is very similar as compared by the protein £uorescence changes. In the case of BSA the £uorescence quenching occurs for a stoichiometric ratio of SDS to protein (maximum in the range 5^10), while for HSA a signi¢cant increase in £uorescence quantum yield occurs also in this range [19]. This result is di¡erent from the time-resolved experiments where quenching was observed for both proteins: in the case of BSA a signi¢cant decrease of lifetimes was observed while for HSA a relatively small decrease is observed (Table 3). From the time-resolved £uorescence data and steady-state results it can be suggested that in the case of HSA a

signi¢cant static quenching occurs in the native protein; upon binding of surfactant this static quenching is removed leading to the observed £uorescence enhancement. The collisional quenching for HSA is a minor e¡ect. For BSA both static and dynamic quenching take place and they should involve the additional tryptophan residue W131 . Static quenching is also predominant in this case. In order to try to explain these spectral di¡erences, a molecular model is proposed reporting the possible changes in the side chain positions and orientations for the W131 (BSA) and W214 (BSA and HSA) neighbour residues at stoichiometric surfactant concentrations. The ¢nal model obtained for complexed BSA presents a good stereochemistry as evaluated by the PROCHECK program with a ¢nal G-factor of 30.09, equivalent to that expected for a crystal strucî ture at 2.5 A resolution. The model also shows good residue packing with an index of 30.93 as evaluated by the QUALTY option of the WHATIF program. This is above the threshold value of 31.2 below which structures should be treated with caution. Residue environment analysis (VERIFY_3D) resulted in a ¢nal index of 224.1, slightly worse than the expected mean value of 264.4, but well within the range for good-quality structures. For unliganded BSA, a G factor of 0.04 was obtained, indicating a good stereochemistry when compared with the structures î solved at 2.5 A resolution. A QUALTY index of

30.557 was obtained which is also above the threshold value of 31.2 and the VERIFY_3D resulted in an index of 235.2 also within the range for good quality structures. The residues of particular relevance to the modelling of the BSA are indicated in the Fig. 6. The relative distances between the W131 residue and the aromatic amino acids in its vicinity which could be interacting with it were taken arbitrarily on the basis of the NE1 atom of the W131 residue and the CQ atom of each one of the aromatic residues [32]. For the modelling of the W131 residue, the lowest energy rotamer was chosen di¡erently from the initial one to eliminate the steric hindrance. As can be seen in the model, the aromatic residues of particular relevance that could interfere in the W131 £uorescence were selected. Thus, in the model, the NE1 atom of the î W131 residue at a distance of 10.6 A from the CQ 123 atom of F in the absence of surfactant changes î to 5.2 A when the surfactant is bound in the macromolecule. In the case of F130 this distance changes î î from 8.6 A in the absence to 5.3 A in the presence of 160 SDS molecules. For F , this distance changes from î î 10.2 A in the absence to 6.5 A after addition of surfactant molecules. Finally, this distance changes î from 6.3 to 8.4 A after addition of surfactant mole156 cules for the Y residue. Besides that, in the presence of SDS, the W131 residue su¡ers an orientation change, acquiring a perpendicular orientation relative to the F130 residue. The exposed surface area

As can be observed on the superposition of the two models, another low-energy rotamer was chosen to build the model containing SDS.

î of W131 changes from 136 A2 in the absence of surî 2 in the presence of SDS molecules. factant to 13.8 A Similarly, the accessible area of W214 changes from î î 19.1 A2 to 13.7 A2 when SDS molecules are added. The major di¡erence observed in the W131 accessible area can be explained by the proximity of the SDS hydrophobic tail to the W131 side chain (Fig. 6). In fact, this accessible area reduction as well as the increase in the proximity of several neighbour protein residues is consistent with the decrease in the quantum yield observed in the data of both steady-state and time-resolved £uorescence spectroscopy. On the interaction of BSA with the surfactants, the residues in the vicinity of W131 that interact directly with the polar headgroup of the surfactants are shown in Fig. 7. For SDS the interactions occur mainly with K113 and R181 residues. In the case of CTAC, only a polar interaction with the nitrogen of the L112 main chain takes place and for HPS the interactions with the three cited residues take place due to the presence of two di¡erent charges of its headgroup. At this point it would be of interest to try to evaluate the binding a¤nity of this site which a¡ects signi¢cantly the W131 orientation and immediate vicinity. In a recent work by Curry et al. [18], the highest a¤nity sites for myristic acid in HSA were

assumed to be three out of six detected in the crystal. The highest a¤nity site was assigned as site 5 within domain III in HSA structure; another two higher a¤nity sites lie close one to another and are in the boundary of domains II and III. So, all of these three sites are relatively distant from W131 residue which is located in the domain I. This means that the spectral changes monitored by tryptophan W131 would be greatly a¡ected by the interaction with a fatty acid (surfactant) molecule which binds to a site which is not one of the three higher a¤nity ones in the protein. In this same paper the authors compare the environments of binding sites in HSA and BSA by modelling some parts of the BSA molecule since its crystal structure remains unknown. For HSA, the superposition of the crystal structures in the speci¢c region of the W214 residue, in the absence and in the presence of SDS molecules is shown in Fig. 8. Similarly to BSA, for HSA, the polar residues in the W214 vicinity that could interact with its side chain, and thus interfere on its £uorescence properties, were selected. Three residues were detected: K195 , R218 and D451 . The inter-residue distances were taken from NE1 atom of W214 to NZ atom of K195 , NH1 atom of R218 and OD1 atom of D451 . In the case of K195 , this distance changes from î î 9.6 A in the absence of surfactant to 10.5 A in the 218 presence of SDS molecules. For R , the distance î between the cited atoms changes from 7.6 to 5.7 A

Fig. 7. Schematic picture showing the superposition of surfactants in their respective BSA models. For SDS, the interactions occur mainly with K113 and R181 residues.

when surfactant molecules are added. Finally, in the case of D451 , the distance between the cited atoms î changes from 5.2 to 8.5 A after addition of surfactant molecules. Despite of the fact that domain II does not bind any SDS molecules it is worth of mention that two of the SDS molecules in the domain III in the border of domain II are close to the interface between domains II and III, possibly, altering the orientations and positions of these polar residues in the vicinity of W214 (Fig. 8). As suggested in [18], these two sites for myristic acid correspond to higher a¤nity ones so their e¡ective occupancy would promote the increase in £uorescence which is observed. The increase in £uorescence quantum yield for HSA observed at low concentrations of SDS could be explained as due to the removal of static quenching upon the binding of surfactant. The removal of static quenching is probably associated either with the increase in the distance between quenching groups and

the indole of W214 or with a change in the relative orientations of the indole and these groups. Our model suggests that both e¡ects are present in the vicinity of W214 . Besides that, there is a reduction of the accessible area for this tryptophan residue î from 19.7 to 18.2 A2 upon binding of surfactant. This reduction of the accessible area is certainly related to the blue shift in the maximum emission £uorescence wavelength observed in the presence of SDS. In fact, for HSA at pH 5.0 this shift for SDS is greater as compared to HPS and CTAC. In the case of BSA the changes in £uorescence emission induced by low surfactant concentrations are probably due to the changes of W131 residue orientation and contacts with neighbour residues. As described above for W131 , in BSA some residues in close contact with the tryptophan indole group are able to e¡ectively quench the £uorescence probably by a static quenching mechanism. It is important to notice that the presence of SDS molecules in the HSA structure supports the formation of two electrostatic interactions: D451 with R218 and D451 with K195 . The former two residues are distant from each î other by 4.2 A and the last two residues are distant î from each other by 3.2 A, forming a salt bridge, which is not observed in the unliganded protein (Fig. 8). These salt bridges could be contributing to stabilize the protein structure in the presence of surfactant. In fact, the circular dichroism data showed

that in the presence of low concentrations of surfactant a very small change is observed in the secondary structure of the protein [19]. In the case of BSA the tryptophan residue W214 , which is a common one to HSA, has its environment quite similar to that of HSA, implying that the changes in these residues are conserved in both proteins. The superposition between both HSA-complexed structures (model

based on the 1BJ5 structure) and non-complexed ones (1AO6 structure) reveals the dramatic nature of the local conformational change that occurs upon binding of the surfactant (Fig. 9), which is quite similar to that described for the binding of myristic acid [4]. 4. Conclusions The results of steady-state £uorescence spectroscopy studies obtained for BSA and HSA in the presence of SDS, HPS and CTAC at pH 5.0 show some di¡erences from the results obtained at pH 7.0 and 9.0, the main results being essentially quite similar. Time-resolved £uorescence data at pH 7.0 suggest that a signi¢cant contribution from a static quenching occurs for BSA while for HSA a removal of static quenching takes place. The e¡ect of surfactants at low concentrations shows a quenching of £uorescence for BSA and an enhancement of £uorescence for HSA. The use of time-resolved £uorescence spectroscopy allowed to separate a static quenching e¡ect in the £uorescence emission of native HSA, which is removed upon surfactant binding. In the case of BSA both static and dynamic quenching of the emission of W131 residue are observed at low surfactant concentrations, the static quenching being the main effect. Analysis of binding of surfactant molecules to the protein was made in the present work using the data for protein £uorescence changes induced by the surfactants. As mentioned before the three higher a¤nity sites named site 5 and sites 3 and 4 according to [18] are located in domain III and in the border of domains II and III. Their binding constants to BSA were assigned as 3.3U107 , 8.3U106 and 3U106 M31 . These binding constants were obtained from spectroscopic studies of interaction of oleic acid with BSA [18] while the exact location of these sites was possible on the basis of recent crystallographic studies [17]. A recent calorimetric study [33] has provided binding constants for SDS to HSA based on the measurement of energetic parameters. The authors obtained three higher a¤nity sites with a binding constant of 3.3U107 M31 and six lower a¤nity sites with a binding constant of 1.9U105 M31 . Treatment of our £uorescence data was made both within the

Hill cooperative model and with a simpler model for the binding which neglects cooperativity. Within the Hill model the decrease of the number of binding sites at pH 5.0 for SDS (both proteins) and CTAC (only BSA) could be indicative that the protein has a more compact packing at this pH, making it di¤cult the accessibility of surfactant molecules in agreement with literature reports [15] and with the fact that the isoelectric point for albumins is close to this pH. For HPS the number of binding sites is almost the same both at pH 7.0 and 5.0. The values of binding constants suggest that the driving force for binding is the hydrophobic interaction. This is quite evident from the binding data to BSA showing a reduction in the association constant for all three surfactants at pH 5.0. The association constants of surfactants to BSA at pH 5.0 obtained from Stern^Volmer plots (Table 1) suggest that the protonation of the protein residues a¡ects the binding of the surfactants, re£ected in a higher constant for SDS and lower constant for CTAC. However, the values of these constants do not di¡er substantially, only by a factor of 3^5, suggesting that the charges of the surfactant headgroups modulate the interactions only partially, and the hydrophobic interactions of surfactant methylene chains are the main responsible for binding. It is worth of mention that at pH 7.0 or 9.0 the association constants are higher as compared to those at pH 5.0. This could be explained due to the fact that at pH 5.0, close to the isoelectric point, the proteins present a compact packing making it di¤cult the access of the surfactants to protein hydrophobic cavities. Increasing the pH, the protein becomes more £exible and open in its structure and the mobile peptide chains contribute to an increase in the accessibility of the surfactants to the hydrophobic core. The initial quenching of £uorescence in BSA was associated to changes induced by the surfactants in the vicinity of the W131 residue upon binding. The location of this residue in domain I is probably responsible for the lower association constant obtained at pH 7.0 of the order of 105 M31 which is consistent with the constant obtained in calorimetric studies for the lower a¤nity binding sites. It should, however, be noticed that the calorimetric data assess the direct binding of surfactant molecules to the protein through liberation or absorption of heat. Spectro-

scopic measurements can only distinguish changes upon binding from small changes in spectroscopic parameters which are limited by the sensitivity of the technique. As stated in Section 2, our binding constants could be greatly underestimated due to the fact that we use in Eq. 3 the total added ligand concentrations instead of the free ligand concentration, which is certainly considerably lower at the initial stage of the titrations. Reduction of protein concentration to a more adequate level to improve this situation would probably be quite limited by the sensitivity of the £uorescence technique in this case. In fact, in the case of BSA it is still possible a reduction of protein concentration by a factor of 10, while for HSA this would be beyond the available sensitivity. Indeed, an experiment with the reduction of the BSA concentration by factors of 3 and 10 has resulted in binding constants for SDS which are a factor of 3 and 10, respectively, greater as compared to the data presented above, supporting our suggestion. This means that tryptophan W131 in domain I is sensitive to the binding of SDS in the higher a¤nity sites in domains III and II. The interaction of HPS with K113 , R181 and L112 of BSA, forming salt bridges between them, produces an stabilizing e¡ect in the secondary structure, which could explain the small or negligible e¡ects observed in the circular dichroism data for this surfactant [19]. Finally, it should be remarked that the binding data obtained from our £uorescence studies are very consistent in the case of BSA having a reasonable explanation both in the limits of the models used in the present work and £uorescence quenching, while in the case of HSA it seems that the e¡ects of binding of surfactants upon the protein £uorescence are more complex, deserving further studies. One possible explanation could be associated to the fact that tryptophan W131 is located in domain I which is more resistant to guanidine denaturation [31] while tryptophan W214 is located in domain II and is more sensitive to guanidine denaturation. This di¡erential sensitivity of denaturation of domains I and II could also occur for surfactant induced protein denaturation which could start in domain II. For this reason in the case of HSA the binding of surfactant would occur simultaneously with the beginning of some denaturation of domain II. This is certainly an interesting matter for further research.
