Background: X-ray crystallography has recently yielded much-improved electron-density maps of the bacterial ribosome and its two subunits and many structural details of bacterial ribosome subunits are now being resolved. One approach to complement the structures and elucidate the details of rRNA and protein packing is to determine structures of individual protein components and model these into existing intermediate resolution electron density. Results: We have determined the solution structure of the ribosomal protein S16 from Thermus thermophilus. S16 is a mixed / protein with a novel folding scaffold based on a five-stranded antiparallel/parallel  sheet. Three large loops, which are partially disordered, extend from the sheet and two  helices are packed against its concave surface. Calculations of surface electrostatic potentials show a large continuous area of positive electrostatic potential and smaller areas of negative potential. S16 was modeled into a 5.5 Å electron-density map of the T. thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit. Conclusions: The location and orientation of S16 in a narrow crevice formed by helix 21 and several other unassigned rRNA helices is consistent with electron density corresponding to the shape of S16, hydroxyl radical protection data, and the electrostatic surface potential of S16. Two protein neighbors to S16 are S4 and S20, which facilitate binding of S16 to the 30S subunit. Overall, this work exemplifies the benefits of combining high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures of individual components with lowresolution X-ray maps to elucidate structures of large complexes.

Introduction
Work on the structure and function of the bacterial ribosome has recently experienced a breakthrough with the interpretation of crystallographic electron-density maps at intermediate resolution [1­4]. A significant portion of ribosomal RNA can be traced in these maps, which also show residual density due to the protein components. However, the latter density is not of sufficiently high resolution to allow for tracing of the polypeptide chain. One attractive way to proceed in building more complete models of the ribosome is to determine structures of individual protein components. These can then be modeled into existing maps using information available from a rich source of published biochemical and biophysical data. Thermus thermophilus S16 consists of 88 amino acid residues. Homologous sequences are found in bacteria and plant organelles. The sequence of S16 from T. thermophilus and closely related bacterial sequences are shown in Figure 1. Small subunit assembly mapping suggests that S16 binding is facilitated by prior assembly of S4, S20 and rRNA [5].

S16 binding, in turn, facilitates binding of S5 and S12. Specific S16­rRNA interactions, in particular with rRNA helix 21, have been suggested on the basis of hydroxyl radical protection experiments [6]. Extra-ribosomal DNAse functions of Escherichia coli S16 have also been suggested [7]. Here we present the solution structure of T. thermophilus S16. The structure is modeled into an unassigned region of the 5.5 Å electron-density map of the small ribosomal subunit. The located binding site is consistent with the size and shape of the protein, its surface electrostatic potential and published hydroxyl radical protection data.

Results and discussion
We have determined the structure of S16 by means of NMR spectroscopy using conventional methods. A 1H,15N-heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of S16 is shown in Figure 2. An ensemble of 47 structures denoted <SA> was calculated using molecular dynamics with simulated annealing. Structural statistics for this ensemble are shown in Table 1 and are presented in a

residue-specific form in Figures 3a and c. Backbone traces of the 47 calculated structures are shown in Figure 4a. The structured part of S16 consists of four antiparallel  strands, an  helix, a parallel  strand and a second  helix (Figure 4b). The N terminus is followed by the first  strand, 1 (Lys3­Phe9), loop 1 (Gly10­Pro15), 2 (His16­Thr22), loop 2 (Asp23­Ile36), 3 (Gly37­Asp40), loop 3 (Pro41­Trp48), 4 (Leu49­Val51), the first  helix, 1 (Val53­Ser61), the parallel  strand 5 (Gln65­Pro66), 2 (Ala70­Gln76), a few ordered residues (Ala77­Val79) and finally a stretch of unstructured residues at the C terminus (Phe80­Ala88).  strands 1­4 form an antiparallel  sheet and  strands 1 and 5 form a parallel  sheet, altogether

forming a five-strandedparallel/antiparallel  sheet. The composition of the  sheet is shown in Figure 5. Both  helices are located on the inside concave face of the  sheet, leaving the other face exposed. Helix 1 is packed against helix 2. A search of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for homologous proteins was carried out using the programs DALI [8] and TOP [9]. No folds related to S16 were found (Z-scores reported by DALI were all less than 1.5), suggesting that the protein represents a previously unknown topology. NMR relaxation data show that dynamics on at least two different timescales occur in uncomplexed S16. The extent of high-frequency (ns­1 to ps­1) motions along the polypeptide backbone can be deduced from [1H]-15N steady-state

1H,15N-HSQC spectrum of the ribosomal protein S16 from T. thermophilus. The amino acid Gly78 is folded in the 15N-dimension.

nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) data presented in Figure 3b. Loops 1 and 2, as well as the C-terminal residues, have lower than average values of the steady-state NOE indicating high-frequency mobility. This is in accordance with the bundle of structures shown in Figure 4a where loop 2, in particular, appears very disordered. The  sheet and  helices have NOE values in the range expected for a well-ordered molecule. In addition, several backbone NMR resonances are exchange-broadened due to large amplitude motion at lower frequencies (ms­1 to µs­1). This can be observed directly in a 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum as broadened resonance line-shapes (Figure 2), or as an exceptionally rapid transverse (R2) relaxation of 15N (measured in a separate experiment; data not shown). These residues include Ala24, Tyr32 and Ile33 in loop 2, Leu49 in 4 and Thr69 between 5 and 2. Several residues in 3 and loop 3 also have fast transverse relaxation of 15N but still appear sharp in the 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum. The backbone amide groups of Lys12, Lys27, Glu34, Trp48 and Asp68 could not be observed at all in any experiments, presumably due to conformational exchange. Core residues of S16 were identified by calculating the exposed surface area for each residue. Residues with an exposed area of less than 10% (1.4 Å probe) of the total area were considered to be buried and thus forming the core of the protein. Core residues identified in this way are Val2, Ile4, Ala7, Ile19, Val20, Val21 Thr22, Ile36, Gly37, Val51, Ala56, Trp59, Ala64, Ala70, Leu73, Leu74 and Val79. There are 17 residues in the core and 14 of these are conserved hydrophobic, one is a conserved glycine and two are not conserved (Figure 1). The ensemble root mean square deviation (rmsd) compared to the mean structure for all heavy atoms in the core is 0.45 ± 0.10 Å. A surface analysis shows that 56% of the total surface area (6975 Å2) is polar. Calculation of electrostatic surface potentials shows that S16 indeed is very charged with large clusters of both positive and negative potential on the surface (Figure 6). Positive potential is mainly found on one face of the protein and is formed by residues in  strand 1 and in loops 1 and 2. Negative potential clusters are smaller and mostly located on the opposite face and at the C terminus. The S16 structure was fit into a 5.5 Å resolution electrondensity map of the 30S ribosomal subunit from T. thermophilus (Figure 7a). The overall fit is good, although there is missing electron density for the large loop 2 and for seven C-terminal residues. The fact that density is missing for these regions is not surprising because they are also disordered in the uncomplexed protein and undergo high-frequency dynamics. The electron density is broken in the  sheet, but this is not uncommon at 5.5 Å resolution. S16 is located in a narrow crevice on the 30S subunit, where it is surrounded by about five rRNA double helices. The location is on the face opposite to the subunit interaction

interface in close contact with rRNA helix 21, and with approximately equal distances to the S4 and S20 proteins (Figure 7b). The location is at about 70 Å distant from that predicted on the basis of neutron scattering data on the 30S subunit from E. coli [10]. However, there is no other protein density in the body of the small subunit that can be S16. Furthermore, the contacts with helix 21 are consistent with hydroxyl radical protection data [6]. RNA-interacting surfaces of S16 coincide very well with areas of positive potential (Figures 6 and 7c). It is also satisfying that S16 is located close to S4 and S20 as these two proteins have been shown to facilitate S16 binding to the 30S subunit [5]. There are many contacts between S16 and RNA observed in the electron density (Figure 7c). The sidechains of Arg5 and Phe9 are close to the phosphate backbone of an unassigned RNA helix and the minor grove of RNA helix 21, respectively. The sidechain of Lys12 interacts with the phosphate from an unassigned RNA helix. The sidechains

The C terminus is outside of the electron density from residue 81. Many of the charged residues in contact with RNA are not conserved (Figure 1). There are however, seven conserved hydrophobic residues and three conserved residues involved in direct contact with RNA. The conserved hydrophobic residues are Phe9 in 1, Tyr17 in 2, Pro41 and Pro46 in loop 3, Tyr58 and Trp59 in 1 and finally Phe80 at the C terminus. The conserved charged residues

are Arg5 in 1, Arg18 in 2 and Arg55 in 1. Conserved sidechains in contact with RNA are shown in Figure 7c. Finally, we note that S16 causes protection of rRNA to chemical modification at a large number of sites [6]. The protection at helix 21 and some additional rRNA helices can be accounted for by direct interactions, but not all of the footprints can be explained by surrounding rRNA helices. At least some of the chemical protection must be indirect, suggesting that S16 binding might generate contacts through a region within the subunit that is not only localized to the binding site.

Biological implications
Translation of an mRNA sequence and biochemical synthesis of proteins occur in the ribosome. The bacterial ribosome consists of three ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments and approximately 55 ribosomal proteins. These form a large (50S) and a small (30S) ribosomal subunit, which associate to form the (70S) ribosome. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of protein synthesis requires knowledge of the ribosome structure. Many years of studies have yielded several component protein structures as well as low-resolution images of the two subunits and the assembled ribosome. The efforts to determine higher-resolution structures of the two subunits have recently experienced a breakthrough as a number of groups have reported 4.5­5.5 Å resolution electron-density maps of the subunits [1­4]. These maps allow for tracing of major fragments of rRNA and placement of the protein components for which the structures have determined separately.

An attractive way to proceed, while awaiting data at even higher resolution, is to continue to determine structures of proteins and model these into the intermediate-resolution maps of the subunits. The modeling can then be guided by information available from biochemical experiments. Here we use this approach to obtain the structure of the S16 protein from Thermus thermophilus and its position and orientation in the small ribosomal subunit. The structure of S16 was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We find that S16 adopts a folding topology that has not been observed previously, with a five-stranded antiparallel/parallel  sheet, two helical regions, and three large loop regions. A large continuous region of positive electrostatic potential is identified. The S16 structure fits well into a narrow crevice formed by several rRNA helices in a 5.5 Å electron-density map of the small ribosomal subunit in T. thermophilus. The position and orientation of S16 in

the identified binding site is consistent with conserved amino acid sidechains at the surface, positive electrostatic potential at the protein­rRNA interaction interface and published hydroxyl radical protection of rRNA upon S16 binding. The location of neighboring S4 and S20 proteins is also consistent with the fact that these two proteins facilitate S16 binding. In summary, the work puts yet another piece in the ribosome puzzle in place, and also demonstrates the utility of combining NMR and X-ray crystallographic methods in studies of large complexes.

2D NOESY was repeated after preliminary structure calculations, using preliminary structures for assignment of ambiguous crosspeaks. Restraints for backbone  dihedral angles were derived from the 3D HNHA spectrum measuring the 3JHNH coupling constants. For scalar couplings 3JHNH > 8 Hz, the  dihedral angles were constrained to ­120 ± 30°. For scalar couplings 3JHNH > 9 Hz the  dihedral angles were constrained to ­120 ± 20°. For scalar couplings in the range 5 Hz > 3JHNH > 3 Hz, the  dihedral angles were constrained to ­60 ± 30°. No corrections for differential relaxation effects were made [26]. All other  dihedral angles were restrained to negative values for nonproline and nonglycine residues. This did not influence the energy of the calculated structures and no NOEs indicative of positive  dihedral angles were found. A short mixing time 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC spectrum and a short mixing time 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum in combination with the 2D NOESY spectrum were used to determine the 1 rotamers and to stereospecifically assign some of the -methylene protons and most of the valine methyl groups. Donors of hydrogen bonds were determined by dissolving a 15Nlabeled sample in 100% D2O. A 1H-15N HSQC spectrum was acquired 15 min after addition of D2O at 30°C using the 500 MHz spectrometer. Amide protons still visible in this 1H-15N HSQC spectrum were assigned as hydrogen-bond donors. Two distance restraints were used for each hydrogen bond in the  sheet: one for the distance between the donor hydrogen and the acceptor oxygen (1.8­2.4 Å) and one for the distance between the donor nitrogen and the acceptor oxygen (2.6­3.2 Å). A single distance restraint was used in  helices between the donor hydrogen and the acceptor oxygen (1.8­2.4 Å).

Materials and methods
Cloning and purification of S16
A fragment of T. thermophilus DNA (2000 bp) containing almost the whole S16 operon was cloned and sequenced (A.R., unpublished observations). The T. thermophilus S16 gene sequence has been submitted to the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database, accession number AJ224859. The gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into plasmid pET11c (Novagen), which was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. S16 samples were produced and purified by the same procedures as we used earlier for T. thermophilus S15 [11]. The purity of S16 preparations used for NMR experiments was not less than 98% as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE).

NMR spectroscopy
The NMR spectra were acquired on Varian Inova spectrometers at 500, 600 and 800 MHz proton frequencies. The spectrometers were equipped with inverse detected 5 mm triple resonance probes (1H, 13C, 15N) and pulsed field gradients. All experiments were performed at 30ºC. The proton chemical shift was referenced to the water resonance at 4.732 ppm while the 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid in a separate experiment [12]. Backbone resonances were assigned using standard procedures with HNCACB [13]/CBCA(CO)NH [14] and HNCA [15]/HN(CO)CA [16] spectra. The backbone amide groups of all residues except Met1, Val2, Lys12, Lys27, Glu34, Trp48, Asp68, Gln82 and the four proline residues have been assigned. Sidechain resonances were assigned using 15N-separated total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY)-HSQC [17,18], clean TOCSY [19], H(CCO)NH [20,21], C(CO)NH [21] and HCCH-TOCSY [22] spectra. Aromatic sidechains were assigned using (HB)CB(CGCD)HD, (HB)CB(CGCDCE)HE [23] and DQF-correlated spectroscopy (COSY) [24] spectra. Structural distance restraints were obtained from an 800 MHz 2D NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) [25] experiment with 90 ms mixing time. Restraints for backbone  dihedral angles were derived from a 3D HNHA [26] spectrum. Dynamics were studied using [1H]-15N steady-state NOE and 15N R2 relaxation rate measurements [27]. NMR data were processed using Varian software (VNMR 5.3) running on a SUN UltraSparc workstation. Linear prediction, zero filling and multiplication with apodization function were used in order to enhance spectral resolution or reduce noise. Spectral analysis was performed using ANSIG 3.3 [28,29] running on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation.

Structure calculations
Structure calculations were performed and analyzed on Silicon graphics computers using X-PLOR (version 3.851) [32], MOLMOL (version 2.6) [33] and PROCHECK-NMR [31]. A total of 1283 nonredundant distance restraints were assigned in the 2D NOESY spectrum. Stereospecific assignment of H resonances and identification of 1 dihedral angle rotamers was possible for ten residues. Stereospecific assignment of the methyl groups and identification of 1 dihedral angle rotamers was possible for 5 out of 7 valines. Backbone  dihedral angles were determined for 32 residues. The  dihedral angles were restricted to negative values for all additional residues. 21 hydrogen bonds were included in calculations. These are partitioned as 20 restraints for ten  sheet hydrogen bonds and 11 restraints for 11 -helical hydrogen bonds. Structures were calculated with X-PLOR using the slightly modified standard protocols sa and refine [32]. During the entire structure calculation procedure center averaging was used as the distance averaging method for nonstereospecifically assigned protons. In the simulated annealing protocol, the molecule was heated to 2000K during 12,000 steps of dynamics, each step being 5 fs, then cooled from 2000K to 100K in 50K intervals during 15,000 steps of dynamics, each step being 5 fs, and finally energy minimized in 200 steps. In the high temperature dynamics, the van der Waal radius was set to 100% of the default value and then lowered from 90% to 78% during cooling and maintained at 78% during minimization. In the simulated annealing protocol the attractive part of the van der Waal interaction was turned off and the repulsive part parameterized in X-PLOR using the parameters `rexp = 2', `irexp = 2', `rcon = 1', `nbxmod = 3' and truncated at 3 Å. In the refinement protocol the molecule was heated to 500K and then cooled to 100K in 50K intervals during 18,000 steps of dynamics, each step being 5 fs. During cooling, the van der Waal radius was lowered from 90% to 78% of the default value. The parameterization of the van der Waal interaction was the same as in the simulated annealing protocol. The refinement was concluded with 200 steps of energy minimization. The 47 structures, denoted <SA>, with lowest X-PLOR energies were chosen out of 50 calculated in order to determine structural statistics. Considering atoms in the ordered residues Lys3­Arg8, His16­Thr22,

Restraints
NOE distance restraints were derived from the 2D NOESY spectrum. Crosspeaks were assigned using ANSIG 3.3 and integrated to obtain peak volumes. The line width parameter used for integration was set to 10 Hz. After adjustment of volumes for multiplicity the restraints were converted to interproton distance restraints based on distances in  helices and  sheets [30]. All distance restraints were divided into four classes: strong, medium, weak and very weak, corresponding to 0.0­2.8 Å, 0.0­3.5 Å, 0.0­5.0 Å and 0.0­6.0 Å, respectively. Pseudo-atom correction was applied at this stage. After classification in ANSIG, the program AQUA [31] was used to discard redundant distance restraints, using the command `redunchk' with the option `-xplor'. Crosspeak assignment in the

Ile33­Pro41, Trp48­Val79, the average atomic rmsds of the <SA> structures from their mean coordinates were 0.36 ± 0.08 Å for the backbone heavy atoms and 1.20 ± 0.13 Å for all heavy atoms. The structures in <SA> were analyzed with respect to precision of atomic positions and dihedral angles, restraint violations, deviations from idealized bond geometries and nonbonded interaction potentials. None of the structures in <SA> have any residues in forbidden regions according to a Ramachandran analysis. All of the residues are found in the most favored or additional allowed regions when considering atoms in the ordered residues Lys3­Arg8, His16­Thr22, Ile33­Pro41 and Trp48­Val79. The location of -helical secondary structures was calculated using PROCHECK-NMR on the complete ensemble <SA>. The  sheets were deduced from relevant NOEs and hydrogen bonds (Figure 5). The surface electrostatic potential of S16 was calculated with MOLMOL using default values. The protein and the solvent dielectric constant were set to 2 and 80, respectively. The monovalent ion concentration was set to 0.3 M. The solvent radius and the salt ion radius were set to 1.4 and 2.0 Å, respectively. Charged residues were represented by point charges.

Modeling into the electron-density map
S16 was modeled into a previously described 5.5 Å electron-density map of the small ribosomal subunit from T. thermophilus [1]. The coordinates for the <SA> ensemble of S16 structures are deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 1EMW. NMR chemical shifts are deposited at the BMRB under the accession number 4727.
