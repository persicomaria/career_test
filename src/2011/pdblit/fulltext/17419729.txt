The structure of the first tetrameric inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) has been solved. This enzyme, from the eubacterium Thermotoga maritima, similarly to its archaeal homologs exhibits dual specificity with both IMPase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activities. The tetrameric structure of this unregulated enzyme is similar, in its quaternary assembly, to the allosterically regulated tetramer of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The individual dimers are similar to the human IMPase. Additionally, the structures of two crystal forms of IMPase show significant differences. In the first crystal form, the tetrameric structure is symmetrical, with the active site loop in each subunit folded into a b-hairpin conformation. The second form is asymmetrical and shows an unusual structural change. Two of the subunits have the active site loop folded into a b-hairpin structure, whereas in the remaining two subunits the same loop adopts an a-helical conformation.

The extended inositol monophosphatase (IMPase) / fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) family provides an interesting case in which the changes in 3D architecture and structural flexibility can be linked to increased specialization and emergence of new function. This structural family was identified at the beginning of the 1990s [1,2]. Since then, the rapid progress in genome sequencing has added many new members. At present, the family contains around 1000 sequences, classified in three Pfam5 subfamilies, of which  600 are in the IMPase subfamily. Despite having the same architectural features at the single monomer level, the proteins in this family show increasingly complex oligomeric organization. The inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatases and 3¢-phosphoadenosine-5¢-phosphate phosphatases are monomeric. Most of the IMPases are dimeric, although the Escherichia coli enzyme (also known as SuhB) can be monomeric as well as dimeric

[3]. All of the eukaryotic FBPases are tetrameric, and some are allosterically regulated by AMP [4] or oxidation of disulfides [5]. The IMPases in higher eukaryotes are involved in secondary messenger signaling by regenerating the myo-inositol pool, whereas the bacterial and archaeal counterparts may be involved in osmolyte synthesis, as has been postulated for the IMPase from Thermotoga maritima (TM1415) [6]. Members of this family show reactivity towards several substrates, including poly phosphorylated inositol species and phosphorylated nucleotides. A few IMPase enzymes from hyperthermophilic organisms also catalyze the hydrolysis of the 1-phosphate of FBP; these have specific FBPase, as well as IMPase, activities [7]. We have previously solved two structures from this superfamily ­ Methanocaldoccocus jannashii IMPase (MJ0109) [7,8] and Archaeoglobus fulgidus IMPase (AF2372) [9] ­ and in

this report we present the structure for TM1415, the IMPase / FBPase from T. maritima. The proteins in the family share a common monomer architecture and have common principles of chemical reactivity. A three metal ion-assisted catalytic mechanism was proposed to function in the entire family [8,10]. It has also been suggested that the enzymes might have a common origin in a postulated ancient cyclitol phosphatase [7]. One of the common elements of this architecture is a loop that closes the active site once the substrate binds. Many of the eukaryotic members of this family (including Homo sapiens IMPase, inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, and FBPase) are inhibited by submillimolar concentrations of lithium ions [11­13]. Li+ therapy is an important remedy against common mental disorders [14], and inhibition of some of the human IMPase family enzymes is believed to be responsible for these therapeutic effects. We have proposed that the mobile loop is the determinant of sensitivity to Li+ [9]. In this report we provide an interesting addition to this already intriguing protein family ­ the crystal structure of an IMPase (from the hyperthermophile T. maritima) that has a tetrameric arrangement and is also the most active IMPase known [6]. Additionally, a fragment of this IMPase (TM1415) shows unusual structural duality. The active site loop (residues 22­42) comes into the direct lattice contact with itself. In one subunit it has an a helical conformation, whereas its partner is in a b conformation. Because this fragment plays a crucial role in catalytic activity and may also be involved in Li+ inhibition, the structural duality supports the idea by Dunker & Wright [15,16], that flexible protein fragments might be involved in developing new functionalities in proteins.

ures, such as the Ramachandran plot and backbone and side-chain statistics, were well within the expected values, as indicated by procheck [19]. The electron density was very good throughout both models (supplementary Fig. S1) with the exception of loop regions, and in particular two catalytic loops (22­42,60­72) on one side of the tetramer in the second crystal form. The C-terminal region appeared to be much more mobile, as reflected by increased temperature factors. The model for crystal form 1 contains the terminal Lys256, whereas the model for crystal form 2 was terminated at Gly254. The difference in electron density suggested the presence of multiple water molecules, as well as a single Mg2+ in the active site of crystal form 1 (supplementary Fig. S1). This metal ion is found in a classical octahedral coordination with Asp79, Glu65 side-chain carboxyls, the carbonyl of Ile81 and three water molecules as direct ligands. In crystal form 2, the difference in electron densities suggested the presence of a single tartaric acid molecule per active site. The tetramer of crystal form 1 is quite symmetrical, whereas the tetramer of crystal form 2 is highly asymmetrical (Table 2). The refined models of both forms contain  300 water molecules. Monomer architecture: common family structure As with other enzymes in this family, including FBPases, the protein has a well-preserved layered structure of a and b secondary-structure elements (a-b-a-b-a) (Fig. 1, left panels), falling into two domains. The lower domain consists of a layer of two a-helices and an extensive seven-stranded b-sheet containing the active site. The lower domain is reminiscent of the AMPbinding domain of eukaryotic FBPases (supplementary Fig. S2). The active site is located at the bulge of the C-terminal end of the third strand with a characteristic DPXD motif, where both aspartates participate in metal ion binding. The strand is followed by a twoturn a-helix that forms a phosphate-binding site. The second domain has a three-layer motif with two layers of a-helices flanking the second b-sheet. This domain corresponds to the FBP-binding domain of FBPases. The two helices of the first domain are connected by a mobile active site loop that previously was suggested to modulate activity by co-ordinating the third metal ion needed for catalysis [8,10]. This loop was also suggested to be involved in Li+ inhibition [9]. The average temperature factors for both domains oscillate below ° 40 A2, with helices being much more ordered than the connecting loops. (See supplementary Fig. S3 for the temperature factor profiles of both models.)

Results and Discussion
Structure solution TM1415 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously [6]. The purified enzyme was crystallized in two crystal forms, characterized by space groups P21 and P212121. The structure was solved by molecular replacement (molrep) [17]. The structure of both crystal forms showed a tetrameric arrangement of this enzyme (Fig. 1). More specifically, both crystal forms contained a single tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The corresponding models were refined using cns ° [18] at 2.2 and 2.4 A resolution for forms 1 and 2, respectively. Refinement resulted in an R-factor of 0.209 and 0.178 (Rfree, 0.278 and 0.267) for forms 1 and 2, respectively (Table 1). Stereochemistry meas2462

Structure of TM1415 IMPase

Fig. 1. Schematic of the transformation of TM1415 into the eukaryotic FBPase. The transformation requires  25° rotation of the dimers around the tetramer axis and  30° rotation of the monomers in individual dimers. In the center there is a schematic of the mutual relationship of the monomers, in selected members of the family, as indicated by the twist angle of the dimer. TM1415 constitutes one of the intermediates between the human IMPase and FBPase dimer organization. In the surrounding panels, clockwise, starting at the top left, are the structure of the tetrameric TM1415, the superposition of TM1415 with the Homo sapiens (human) IMPase (in gold), the superposition of Sus scrofa (pig) FBPase with the MJ0109 (in blue), and the tetrameric pig FBPase. The secondary structure elements are marked in red (helices) and yellow (b-sheets).

Dimer architecture: similarity to human IMPase Despite being a bacterial enzyme and having significant sequence divergence, the overall architecture of the dimer is reminiscent of the human IMPase (Fig. 1, right panel). However, the dimer interface is quite different from the human enzyme and other nonarchaeal IMPases. The superposition of the second subunit of the MJ0109 structure (1G0H) after superposition of the first subunit requires a rotation of  15° along the longest axis of the dimer in one direction, whereas superposition onto the second subunit of the human enzyme (1AWB) requires rotation of  15° in the opposite direction. The rotation around the axis that intersects the self-contacting residue, Ile173, is denoted as the dimer twist-angle. To superpose the second subunit on the structure of the eukaryotic FBPase takes a 30° rotation in the twist direction of the archaeal enzyme. In comparing the dimer orientation of all these IMPases, we see that the human IMPase has the extreme dimer twist-angle that is almost 45° off from

the dimer position in FBPases, whereas the TM1415 and MJ0109 constitute intermediate twists spaced 15° off each other (central panel of Fig. 1). Tetramer architecture: similarity to FBPase TM1415, besides being the most active IMPase ( 100-fold more active than its archaeal, bacterial or eukaryotic counterparts) [6], is also a very efficient FBPase [7]. It is notable that the TM1415 structure represents a tetrameric organization for an IMPase (Fig. 1) reminiscent of the eukaryotic FBPase organization. Each tetramer is organized as a dimer of dimers (Fig. 1). Despite the fact that TM1415 lacks the additional helix (FBPases have three helices at the tetramer interface), the helical layers in both enzymes directly interact. This dimer­dimer interface was shown to be crucial for the transition of the allosteric signal in pig kidney FBPase [20]. The rotation around the axis that relates dimers is termed the tetramer twist-angle. The TM1415 tetramer, despite having a

Boxes in broken lines represent symmetry-related contacts to those enclosed by the solid boxes. The contact on the left hand side comprises the active site loop (residues 22­42), shown in detail in Figs 3 and 4. At the other side of the tetramer, the active site loops are not in direct lattice contact, resulting in much higher temperature factors. Both loops in the upper dimer, regardless of the packing contact, are in a helical conformation, whereas the lower dimer loops are in an extended conformation.

rotated T state (the eukaryotic T state is rotated only 17° away from the R state, Fig. 1) [21]. As indicated in the central panel of Fig. 1, a rotation of  25° in tetramer twist, and an additional dimer twist in both dimers of  30°, are required to transform TM1415 into the FBPase. This nonregulated tetrameric organization of the T. maritima IMPase / FBPase might represent an evolutionary intermediate between dimeric IMPases and the allosterically regulated tetrameric eukaryotic FBPases. As a reminder, not all eukaryotic FBPases are allosterically regulated by AMP (e.g. chloroplast FBPase) [5]. However, the quaternary structures of these IMPase and FBPases suggest that quaternary organization may be critical in creating regulatory abilities.
Fig. 3. The view of the active site of both superposed TM1415 models (crystals forms 1 and 2) and that of human IMPase (PDB code 1AWB). The model of the human enzyme (in light gray) has three metal ions bound (yellow spheres) and the substrate (D-inositol-1-phosphate, gray). The model of the TM1415 crystal form 1 is in purple and the crystal form 2 in green (including the tartrate molecule). The conformational change in loop 22­42 is indicated by green arrows, and the change in the 60s loop harboring Glu65­66 directly co-ordinating metal ions, is shown in red arrows. The contact of the active site loop (22­42) in the helical (in green, crystal form 2), as well as in the extended conformation (in purple, crystal form 1), to the symmetry mate in extended conformation is marked by a blue arrow.

Crystal packing Both crystal forms of TM1415 have a tetramer present in the asymmetric unit with similar packing of individual tetramers. However, in crystal form 2, the packing is not as tight as in crystal form 1. In crystal form 1 (P21), the solvent content is 44.3% and the tetramers have multiple contacts with their neighbors. Crystal packing contacts are numerous across the entire tetramer surface and include some weak contacts in the loop region (residues 22­42). The crystal contacts in form 1 leave sufficient room for unhindered packing of the loops in the b-hairpin conformation. In crystal form 2, the contacts are much more sparse, despite having almost the same solvent content (43.6%) as crystal form 1. Two important lattice

similar quaternary arrangement to eukaryotic FBPases, is more twisted, and the lower dimer requires  25° rotation to superpose with the corresponding dimer of the R-state FBPase. It can be compared with an over2464

Even though the crystal packing in both forms is different, in form 2 there is still sufficient space around the loops so that the lattice could accommodate the tetramer with all loops in b-hairpin conformation,without significant structural changes (Fig. 3).

The direct comparison of both crystal forms provides unexpected insights into the principles of protein design and shows an unusual structural plasticity. The tetramer in crystal form 1 (P21) is very symmetrical (the rmsds between individual subunits are listed in Table 2), whereas the tetramer in the crystal form 2 is very asymmetrical. In the following discussion, we use the nomenclature suggested in Fig. 4B, which identifies the upper and lower dimers in the tetrameric structure. In crystal form 2, the lower dimer has the active site loops in the b-hairpin conformation, whereas in the upper dimer the loops are folded into two short a-helices (Figs 3 and 4). The color brackets in Fig. 4 indicate the same fragment folded in different conformations in lower and upper dimers. Despite lacking any significant contacts, loops in the upper and lower dimers of crystal form 2 have distinct and different conformations (Fig. 4). The loop (residues 62­72) shows significantly changed architecture from a more extended conformation (b-sheet in form 1) to the more coiled conformation in form 2. The active site loop (residues 22­42), and the loop (residues 62­72) in TM1415 are required for the formation of the active site in IMPase and FBPase [8,10]. Figure 3 shows the superposition of both crystal forms of TM1415 and the human IMPase with a full complement of metal ions and the substrate. The structures superpose well at the active site region and the figure shows the change in conformations of those two active site loops (green and red arrows). Both loops harbor the residues involved in metal ion binding and therefore the subunits with alternative loop conformation would be incapable of binding the full set of metal ions. Additionally, residue Asp44, which plays a crucial role in the catalytic mechanism (creation of the nucleophile) in both upper subunits, has an alternative conformation in which it loses a direct contact to Thr84 Oc that is critical for water activation. All of these conformational changes make the upper dimer catalytically incompetent. The catalytic loops in crystal form 1 have temperature factors slightly higher than, but comparable with, the rest of the structure (Table 1). The stability of the loops is confirmed with the quality of the electron

to, the rest of the structure; the remaining two loops have substantially higher temperature factors (supplementary Fig. S4) and much weaker electron densities. The symmetrical crystal form 1 has a single metal ion bound at the active site. This metal contributes to the stabilization of active site architecture. Choe et al. [10] concluded that this particular metal ion-binding site is the most frequently occupied and has the highest affinity to metal ions in FBPase. The metal ion does not make direct contact with either of the two mobile loops. In crystal form 2, we found no metal ions, but a single molecule of tartaric acid in the active site cavity. This ligand does not interact with any elements of the active site loop. Its location is somewhat reminiscent of the sugar moiety of the substrate (Fig. 3). Therefore, it would be difficult to argue that the tartrate or the metal ion is the cause of the asymmetry. The asymmetry must originate from two differently organized dimers present in solution that are dynamically incorporated into the lattice during crystallization (supplementary Fig. S5). Evolutionary link The active site loop sequence (residues 22­42) is partially similar to the human enzyme and partially similar to the sequences of M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus IMPases (Fig. 5). In Fig. 5 we present the alignment of the TM1415 sequence with sequences resulting from the BLAST searches and clustering of all 786 independent sequences into 13 functional families. Every sequence in Fig. 5 represents a single protein family that has distinct functionality. Figure 5 shows a small fragment of the alignment, including the mobile loop sequences. Judging by the clustering of sequences, TM1415 is closer to the human IMPase. The mobile loop sequence fits the environment less than other fragments (as measured by psqs, data not shown). The results of servers ranking this fragment propensity for order-disorder (disprot) [22] clearly suggest that this fragment has a tendency to be disordered. Therefore, this fragment has evolved to be mobile and less structured. The characteristic element for our sequence is that, when aligned structurally with other members of the family, the fragment has low sequence conservation (Fig. 5). It has variable length as well as amino acid content, suggesting that the fragment is rapidly evolving. Even when crucial positions are preserved, different residues fulfill the same structural role (Figs 4 and 5). The other fragment (160s loop), predicted to be unstructured (supplementary Fig. S4), participates in the assembly of the dimer and also of the tetramer. As

presented above, the change in the aggregation state contributed to a change in enzyme functionality. The inhibition, by Li+, of several members of the family, must also be considered as an acquisition of a novel functionality. In summary, the low sequence conservation and high variability of both loops when linked to their structural instability suggests evolution of novel functionalities being driven by changes in sequence of those fragments [15,16,23].

Experimental procedures
Cloning and protein production
The TM1415 protein was expressed in E. coli, as described previously [6]. After cell lysis and removal of the cell debris by centrifugation, the supernatant containing TM1415 was heated to 85 °C and the denatured E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation. The enzyme was further purified by column chromatography on a Sepharose QFF column. The protein was > 96% pure, as measured by SDS / PAGE.

+ form, on the RaxisIV+ area detector mounted on the Rigaku rotating anode at the X-ray facility at Rice University (Houston, TX, USA). The structure was solved by molecular replacement (molrep), using the model constructed from the structures of several IMPases (human, MJ0109 and AF2372) as search probes. The sequence of TM1415 shares the highest similarity to human IMPase ( 26% identity) and therefore this molecule was used as a scaffold. However, there are three deletions (residues 70s, 160s and 210s), making it a bit shorter. Those crucial deletions are shared with MJ0109 and AF2372. Therefore, we used those molecules to construct the fragments not corresponding well to the human structure. The probe model was built from fragments of those proteins with the highest homology to TM1415. The full atom model was used for molecular replacement and later refined, using cns, to a standard R-factor of 0.209 and 0.178, as calculated on all ° reflections to 2.2 and 2.4 A resolution, respectively, for forms 1 and 2. The data collection and refinement statistics can be found in Table 1.

Sequence versus structure analysis
The iterated BLAST search was used to establish the members of the multifunctional IMPase family. The groupings followed the CDD classification of the NCBI (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=cdd). The sequence to 3D structure fit was estimated by the program psqs, developed at the Burnham Institute by A. Godzik. Predictions of the disorder were performed at the web server of the disprot (Dunker) [21]. We also carried out a clustering experiment in which we investigated the entire IMPase / FBPase family. The PFAM clan `inositol polyphosphate 1 phosphatase like superfamily' includes three PFAM domain families (a) Inositol_P(PF00459), (b) FBPase(PF00316) and (c) FBPase_glpX(PF03320). The Inositol_P family has 65 sequences in its seed alignment, representing 586 proteins; and FBPase and FBPase_glpX each has 14 and 6 seed sequences, representing 233 and 101 proteins.

Crystallography
The protein was crystallized by the standing drop vapor diffusion method. Five microlitres of the enzyme, in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, was mixed with 5 lL of the crystallization buffer containing 15% (w / v) PEG 4000, 15% (v / v) PEG 400, 0.2 m MgSO4, and 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, in 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 8. The crystals appeared in 1 week and had the morphology of chunky prisms with a lattice organized by P21 symmetry. Mixing 5 lL of the enzyme in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 5 lL of the crystallization buffer containing 15% (v / v) PEG 400 0.2 m sodium tartrate, and 0.2 m (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm citrate, pH 5.6, resulted in crystals with the morphology of thin plates characterized by the ° P212121 space group.

All these 85 seed sequences were clustered into subfamilies at 25% sequence similarity and one representative sequence was selected for each subfamily. Within each cluster, all the sequences were similar to the representative at 25% similarity or more, but similarities between all the representatives of different clusters were below 25%. The clustering was performed with program cd-hit [24]. These 85 sequences were clustered into 13 subfamilies. Three families represented singletons, and another 10 subfamilies contained 2­22 members. Five subfamilies contained proteins with 3D structures deposited in PDB. The average identity within each cluster was 35%. Figure 4 shows the alignment of TM1415 (which belongs to the IMPA1_HUMAN cluster) with representative proteins from each cluster. The initial alignment was made using clustalw [25] and was edited according to the structural alignment of five present in the PDB proteins.
