Designed peptides that fold autonomously to specific conformations in aqueous solution are useful for elucidating protein secondary structural preferences. For example, autonomously folding model systems have been essential for establishing the relationship between -helix length and -helix stability, which would be impossible to probe with -helices embedded in folded proteins. Here, we use designed peptides to examine the effect of strand length on antiparallel -sheet stability. -Helices become more stable as they grow longer. Our data show that a two-stranded -sheet (`` -hairpin'') becomes more stable when the strands are lengthened from five to seven residues, but that further strand lengthening to nine residues does not lead to further -hairpin stabilization for several extension sequences examined. (In one case, all-threonine extension, there may be an additional stabilization on strand lengthening from seven to nine residues.) These results suggest that there may be an intrinsic limit to strand length for most sequences in antiparallel -sheet secondary structure.

ost proteins must fold to a specific three-dimensional shape to perform their biological functions. There is great interest in identifying the factors that determine native conformations; however, despite considerable study, it is not yet possible to predict tertiary folding patterns on the basis of primary structure. A few secondary structures (especially -helix and -sheet) recur throughout known protein structures, and understanding the forces that control conformational preferences within the common secondary structures should contribute to our understanding of conformational preferences at tertiary and quaternary levels. The -helix has been very carefully scrutinized because there are well-established design principles for creating synthetic peptides that adopt -helical secondary structure in the absence of a specific tertiary context (1­7). Until recently, the lack of autonomously folding -sheet model systems made it impossible to conduct analogous studies with this secondary structure (8). In the past several years, however, a number of short peptides (9­24 residues) that display double- or triple-stranded antiparallel -sheet conformations in aqueous solution have been reported (9­11). These model systems provide thermodynamic (12­23) and kinetic (24) insights on -sheet folding behavior. [Solvent-exposed -sheets in specific tertiary contexts have provided a complementary approach for elucidation of -sheet conformational preferences (25, 26)]. Here, we show how small designed peptides can be used to assess an aspect of -sheet stability that has not previously been addressed experimentally. -Helices become more stable as the length of the helix increases (5­7). This length-dependent effect on conformational stability arises because helix initiation is thermodynamically unfavorable but helix propagation is favorable, at least for some residues (1, 2). Analogous length-dependent stabilization is observed for double-helical nucleic acid conformations (27) and for unnatural oligomers that adopt helical secondary structures (28). Length-dependent stabilization is a more complex issue for sheet secondary structure than for a helix: two dimensions must be considered for a sheet (20), whereas only one dimension

(along the helix axis) is important for a helix (1, 5­7). Fig. 1 shows the two dimensions in which protein -sheet could display length-dependent stabilization, for propagation from a twostranded antiparallel sheet (a `` -hairpin''): along the strand direction (Fig. 1a) and perpendicular to the strand direction (Fig. 1b). Each dimension can be evaluated independently because of our ability to design short peptides that display -sheet conformations containing a predetermined number of strands with defined lengths (9­11). We have previously obtained evidence for length-dependent stabilization perpendicular to the strand direction (Fig. 1b) in a designed triple-stranded -sheet that folds in water (20). Similar observations have been reported for a three-stranded -sheet that folds in aqueous methanol (13) and more recently for a three-stranded design that folds in water (22). However, little or no length-dependent stabilization perpendicular to the strand direction was detected in water for an alternative three-stranded -sheet design (23). Here we focus on the question of length-dependent stabilization along the strand direction (Fig. 1a). Materials and Methods
DP-TT were 2 prepared and purified as described previously (29). DP-TT2 was synthesized on methylbenzhydrylamine resin by using the in situ neutralization O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N, N -tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation protocol for Boc-Solidphase peptide synthesis (30). Dimethylformamide was used as coupling solvent for most of DP-TT2, but DMSO was used for the last five residues.

derived from NOE spectroscopy and ROESY data. Only NOEs between nonadjacent and turn-defining residues were used as restraints for dynamics analysis. NOE intensities were qualitatively assigned to be strong, medium, weak, or very weak, and assigned constraints of 3, 4, 5, and 6 Å, respectively; a total of 32 restraints were used for DP-TT2. Restraints were checked by using the ``distance check'' function within DYANA, which showed there were no ``lonely'' or possibly misassigned NOEs that could unduly influence the final conformation. DYANA was used to generate 500 random structures, which were subsequently annealed. The best 10 structures (fewest restraint violations) were selected. were carried out at 4°C on a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-A instrument. The peptides were studied at their respective NMR sample concentrations and at lower concentrations in H2O D2O (9:1 ratio), 100 mM sodium deuteroacetate buffer, with pH adjusted to 3.8 with NaOH (pH measurements were not corrected for isotope effects). Revolution speeds of 44 K min and 56 K min were used. Data were analyzed by using the IGOR PRO program (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Peptides were found to be monomeric in all cases. Results Our approach to probing the effects of strand length on -sheet stability is based on a designed 12-residue peptide (DP; Fig. 2) that we have previously shown to adopt a -hairpin conformation in aqueous solution (14, 16). DP contains a central D-Pro-Gly segment to induce formation of a ``mirror image'' -turn (type I or II ) (32­36); the local right-handed twist of such turns is compatible with the right-handed twist of the strands in a -sheet (37). Although D-proline is not a proteinogenic residue, structural analysis of 12-mer DP via two-dimensional NMR shows that this peptide adopts a native-like two-stranded antiparallel -sheet conformation in aqueous solution (14, 16). Ornithine, one of the strand residues in DP, is not found in natural proteins; however, the presence of this residue does not diminish the biological relevance of our results, because we have shown that the analogue of DP containing lysine in place of ornithine behaves identically to DP (16). The folded state of DP, like that of other short peptides, is not fully populated in aqueous solution at accessible temperatures; the -hairpin conformation of DP is 68% populated at 4°C (16). To determine whether antiparallel -sheet becomes more stable as the strands grow longer, we compared the folded state population of DP with the populations of longer peptides that contain the sequence of DP at their cores (e.g., DP-TT and DP-TT ; Fig. 2). NMR methods (38­41) were used to monitor 2 -sheet population at strand residues in the core, which are common to all of the peptides. The extension increment, two residues on each strand, is dictated by the fact that there are two types of strand residue in a double-stranded antiparallel -sheet:

residues that form cross-strand hydrogen bonds (``hydrogen bonded'') and residues that direct their backbone hydrogenbonding sites away from the other strand (``nonhydrogen bonded''). Thus, extension by two residues in each strand is necessary to generate a regular antiparallel -sheet series in which all members have the same type of interstrand pairing at the termini (hydrogen bonded, in our case). Threonine was selected for the first set of extensions because this residue has a high -sheet propensity (42­44), but it is not very hydrophobic, in contrast to other -sheet-prone residues. Analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that none of these peptides aggregates under the conditions of the NMR measurements. The NMR data for DP, DP-TT, and DP-TT2 summarized in Fig. 3 indicate qualitatively that both the 12-residue core and the threonine extension segments engage in intramolecular -sheet interactions. The chemical shifts of -protons ( H) are very sensitive to secondary structure; residues in -sheets tend to display downfield-shifted H, and residues in -helices tend to display upfield-shifted H, relative to the unstructured state (``random coil'') (45, 46). Fig. 3 presents H[ H (obs) H (random coil)] for the strand residues in each peptide. We follow the standard practice of using random coil H values determined with very short peptides (e.g., Gly-Gly-Xxx-Ala) (47). 0.1 are Segments containing three or more H values

The reported random coil H value for lysine was used for ornithine (random coil H values from ref. 47). No data are shown for the N-terminal residue of each peptide because this terminus is uncapped. For DP-TT2, H of Thr-17 and Thr-18 could not be unambiguously assigned; the H values shown for these two residues are based on the average of the two observed H values (4.54 and 4.72 ppm).

considered to be -strands (45, 46). By this qualitative criterion, -sheet formation extends from the turn to the penultimate residue in each strand for DP, DP-TT, and DP-TT2. ROSEY (39, 40) data indicate that the core segments of DP-TT and DP-TT adopt -hairpin conformations analogous to 2 that observed for DP. As previously reported (16), DP displays numerous interstrand NOEs, all of which are consistent with the expected -hairpin folding pattern. Many of the corresponding NOEs are also observed for the central 12 residues of the longer peptides (summarized graphically for DP-TT2 in Fig. 4). In each case, a set of NOEs is observed between the Tyr and Leu residues that should be directly across from one another in the expected -hairpin conformation. For DP, we observe also a set of NOEs between Tyr-2 and Lys-9, a ``diagonal'' pairing that reflects the right-handed twist commonly displayed by -sheets (37). DP-TT displays a set of NOEs for an additional diagonal pairing, between Thr-2 and Leu-13, and DP-TT2 displays an analogous set of NOEs for diagonal pairing between Thr-4 and Leu-15. NMR data were used to generate the solution structure of DP-TT2 with the program DYANA (31). Among the 10 best structures rms

deviation 2.54 0.82 Å (backbone atoms only). Disorder is evident toward the end of each strand, but the -hairpin conformation is well-defined over the central residues (rms deviation 0.79 0.40 Å among the 10 best structures for Arg-5 through Gln-16 of DP-TT2). Neither DP-TT nor DP-TT2 displayed any NOE evidence of an alternative folded conformation. Our experimental strategy requires that the folding behavior of DP conform to a two-state model, unfolded vs. -hairpin, and that it be possible to quantify the folding equilibrium. We have established both of these features in previous studies of DP. -Proton chemical shift data ( H) are used to determine -hairpin population (16) because, as discussed above, this NMR parameter is very sensitive to secondary structure. This strategy allows us to monitor population at several independent sites along the peptide backbone. We found earlier (16) that only strand residues in hydrogen-bonded positions (Val-3, Val-5, Orn-8, and Ile-10 of DP; highlighted in Fig. 2) are suitable for population analysis. Aromatic sidechains, e.g., Tyr-2 of DP, seem to interfere with quantification on the basis of strand residues in nonhydrogen-bonded positions, the -protons of which are directed toward the other strand in the folded state (16, 18). Population analysis of DP and related peptides based on H data requires that one know H for the limiting states, unfolded ( U) and folded ( F), because conformational interconversion is rapid on the NMR timescale. Replacing D-Pro with L-Pro completely abolishes -hairpin formation (14, 16, 18, 34, 36), and the L-Pro diastereomer of DP provides an excellent representation of the completely unfolded state of DP (i.e., an excellent source of U values). Closing off the open end of DP with a second D-Pro-Gly segment generates a cyclic peptide, c(DP)2, which has a very high -sheet population (i.e., an excellent source of F values) (16). The -sheet population (P ) of DP at a given strand residue can be calculated based on three chemical shift measurements (Eq. 1), P

where obs is H for the residue of interest in DP, U is H for the residue of interest in the L-Pro diastereomer of DP, and F is H for the residue of interest in cyclic peptide c(DP)2. We use the same U and F values for population analysis of DP-TT and DP-TT , because the threonine extensions are well-separated 2 from the four hydrogen-bonded strand residues used to determine -hairpin population. -Hairpin formation by DP is a two-state process, as demonstrated by the uniform temperature dependence of -hairpin population determined at the four indicator residues, Val-3, Val-5, Orn-8, and Ile-10 (ref. 29). In the analysis below, we have assumed that two-state behavior is displayed by DP-TT and DP-TT2 and other extended peptides, at least in the core segments that correspond to the 12 residues of DP. Table 1 shows -hairpin populations calculated at the four indicator residues of DP, DP-TT, and DP-TT2 at 4°C. Also shown are differences in -hairpin stability ( G) between DP and the longer peptides. G values were calculated for each of the four indicator residues on the basis of the population data and a two-state folding model; the four residue-specific G values were averaged to obtain the G values shown in Table 1. For each peptide, the -hairpin populations deduced at the four different residues are reasonably consistent. The apparent variation in deduced population within individual peptides could arise from real differences in the extent of -hairpin folding at each position and or from systematic error associated with the choice of reference peptides. Both sources of variation should be mitigated in the calculation of G because comparison of specific residues in homologous peptides should lead to cancellation of systematic effects.

The % -hairpin values have an uncertainty of 2­ 4%, which arises from the 0.01 ppm uncertainty in H.

themselves but the qualitative implications of the trends that are of greatest interest. The average G value for DP-TT in Table 1 indicates that extending the strands of DP from five to seven residues causes a significant enhancement of -hairpin stability. However, extending the strands from seven to nine residues gives a more ambiguous result. The G value for DP-TT2 does not differ from the G value for DP-TT within the uncertainty of the measurements, but the deduced -hairpin population increases at each of the four indicator residues of DP-TT2 relative to DP-TT. This result raises the possibility that little or no additional stabilization is achieved by strand lengthening from seven to nine residues. We compared three other NMR parameters for DP, DP-TT, and DP-TT , C H­C H NOE intensities, C chemical 2 shifts, and N-H chemical shifts, to determine whether the trend G values is reliable. These reflected by the H-derived comparisons strengthened our confidence in the H-based approach. Where possible, we estimated -hairpin population via C H­ C H NOE intensities for nonhydrogen bonded residue pairs directly across from one another (e.g., Tyr-2 and Leu-11 in DP). This approach starts with the assumption that the C H­C H distance in the folded state is 2.3 Å, which corresponds to ideal antiparallel -sheet. In addition, it is assumed that the C H­C H distance in the unfolded state is too large to allow any NOE. This strategy is inherently problematic because of the inverse sixth power dependence of NOE intensity on H­H separation, which magnifies the effect of errors in starting assumptions. For DP, the Tyr-2 C H­ Leu-11 C H NOE intensity implies 50% -hairpin population, which is in reasonable agreement with the 68 8% -hairpin population deduced from H data under the same conditions. Proximity between C H chemical shifts and the solvent resonance prevented estimation of the -hairpin population for DP from the Glu-4 C H­Lys-9 C H NOE intensity. This problem also prevented population estimation from either the Tyr-4 C H­Leu-13 C H NOE or the Glu-6 C H­Lys-11 C H NOE of DP-TT. However, both the Tyr-6 C H­Leu-15 C H and the Glu-8 C H­Lys-13 C H NOE intensities could be analyzed quantitatively for DP-TT2, and both indicated 60% -hairpin population, which is in reasonable agreement with the 84 6% -hairpin population deduced for DP-TT from the 2 H data. Most importantly, the NOE-based population analysis is consistent with the H-based analysis in showing that strand lengthening (DP to DP-TT2) leads to enhanced -hairpin population. 13Carbon chemical shifts of carbons ( c) are sensitive to secondary structure, with residues in -sheet showing upfield shifts, and residues in -helices showing downfield shifts relative

to random coil (48). Fig. 5 shows c[ c(obs) c(random coil)] data for the strand residues common to DP, DP-TT, DP-TT2, and c(DP)2. The c (random coil) values were obtained from the L-Pro diastereomer of DP. For each peptide, 0 for all but c one or two strand residues. This trend supports our conclusion that each peptide displays a high degree of -sheet folding. Variations from the expected behavior at Tyr and Leu indicate that c measurements report on more than the secondary structural environment of the residue in question, which is also D true of H measurements. The qualitative trends among P, DP-TT, DP-TT , and c(DP) support our conclusion that -sheet 2 2 population increases along this series. We used Eq. 1 to calculate -hairpin population from c data at 4°C for DP, DP-TT, and DP-TT2, by using the L-Pro diastereomer of DP to provide U and c(DP)2 to provide F. These calculations involved the four indicator residues used for the H-based population estimates, Val-3, Val-5, Orn-8, and Ile-10 of DP and the analogous residues of DP-TT and DP-TT2. For DP, the c data suggested 57 13% -hairpin population (vs. 68 8% suggested by the H data), for DP-TT, the c data suggested 65 6% -hairpin population (vs. 78 5% suggested by the H data), and for DP-TT2, the c data suggested 76 5% -hairpin population (vs. 84 6% suggested by the H data). Thus, the

c approach consistently implies a moderately lower -hairpin population than does the H approach, but the lengthdependent trend is comparable in the two data sets. [The uncertainty at the level of average -hairpin population, calculated from either H or c data, is greater than the uncertainty calculated for average G (Table 1), because at least some systematic error is eliminated in the G calculations, as pointed out above.] 1H chemical shifts of amide protons ( NH) are sensitive to intramolecular hydrogen bond formation in well-folded proteins, with NH values for NH internally hydrogen bonded downfield relative to NH values for NH exposed to solvent (49). The supporting information provides NH [ NH (obs) NH (random coil)] data for the strand residues common to DP, DP-TT, DP-TT , and c(DP) . The 2 2 NH (random coil) values were obtained from the L-Pro diastereomer of DP. NH 0 for most residues in most peptides, but the NH values are largest for residues that are expected to participate in interstrand hydrogen bonds in the folded state (Val-3, Val-5, and Ile-10 in DP, and analogous residues plus Gln in the other peptides). Thus, even though the -hairpin conformations of DP, DP-TT, and DP-TT2 are not fully populated, these systems appear to follow the NH trend observed in folded proteins (49). The general trends among the NH data for the internally hydrogen bonded residues across the series DP, DP-TT, DP-TT2 are consistent with the G data in indicating that -hairpin population increases as the strands grow longer. Four independent NMR parameters, H, C H­C H NOE intensities, c and NH, support our conclusion that lengthening the five-residue strands of DP to generate DP-TT and DP-TT leads to an increase in -hairpin stability as measured at 2 core residues common to all three peptides. The data suggest additional stabilization from further lengthening beyond sevenresidue strands (from DP-TT to DP-TT2), although this conclusion is more ambiguous (Table 1). We therefore examined additional extension sequences. The design of the second extension series, DP-ST and DP-ST2 (Fig. 2), was based on the observation that serine has the second-highest -sheet propensity (after threonine) for a strand at the outer edge of a -sheet (44). The G data show that, as for DP-TT, 16-mer DP-ST forms a -hairpin that is significantly more stable than the -hairpin formed by 12-mer DP (Table 1). However, G data for DP-ST2 indicate that lengthening the -hairpin strands from seven to nine residues does not provide any additional stability. This conclusion was supported by NH data (published as supporting information on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org). We considered two alternative explanations for the discontinuous behavior clearly displayed in the ST series, i.e., for the observation that lengthening the strands from five to seven residues stabilizes the -hairpin, whereas further strand lengthening to nine residues provides little or no further stabilization. Hypothesis 1: Length-dependent stabilization occurs in antiparallel -sheet, but a competing length-dependent effect destabilizes the -sheet conformation when strands grow long enough Hypothesis 2: There is an energetically favorable interaction in the -hairpin conformations of DP-ST and DP-ST2 between the first extension increment and the core segment, but no analogous interaction between the second extension increment and ``inner'' part of DP-ST2. ROESY data for DP-ST and DP-ST2 suggest an extension core interaction that would be consistent with the second explanation: the diagonal side-chain­side-chain pairing between a threonine residue in the first extension increment of the N-terminal strand (Thr-2 in DP-ST or Thr-4 in DP-ST2) and the leucine residue in the C-terminal strand of the core (Leu-13 in DP-ST or Leu-15 in DP-ST2). In contrast, no diagonal NOEs were detected in DP-ST2 between Thr-2 (in the second extension increment) and Thr-17 (in the first extension increment). (The

same pattern of side-chain NOEs was observed in the DP-TT 2 series.) We have previously shown through mutational analysis of DP that diagonal interstrand side-chain­side-chain interactions can contribute to the stability of antiparallel -sheet (29); therefore, the stability trend among DP, DP-ST, and DP-ST2 could arise if the diagonal interactions between Thr-2 and Leu-13 in DP-ST and between Thr-4 and Leu-15 in DP-ST2 contributed to net -hairpin stability. To distinguish between the two hypotheses outlined above, we examined two additional 16-mer 20-mer sets containing the DP core (Fig. 2). In DP-TA and DP-TA2, the nonhydrogen-bonded residues of the extension have been changed to alanine, relative to DP-TT and DP-TT2. We assume that the alanine side chain is so short that interactions with side chains on an adjacent strand will not contribute significantly to -sheet stability (50). Therefore, if the enhanced stability of the -hairpin conformations of DP-TT and DP-ST relative to the -hairpin conformation of DP arises from diagonal interaction between Thr-2 and Leu-13 in DP-TT or DP-ST (hypothesis 2), then the -hairpin conformation of DP-TA should be less stable than the -hairpin conformation of DP-TT or DP-ST. Table 1 shows that the -hairpin conformation of DP-TA is comparable in stability to the -hairpin conformation of DP-TT or DP-ST and that further extension to DP-TA2 does not lead to a significant increase in -hairpin stability relative to DP-TA. (These conclusions for the TA series are supported by NH data, which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org) These results suggest that hypothesis 2 is incorrect and that the increase in -hairpin stability observed for 16-mers relative to 12-mer DP reflects an intrinsic effect of -hairpin length (hypothesis 1). Extension series ST Y (Fig. 2) provides a complementary test of the competing hypotheses presented above, because this extension sequence is expected to allow stabilizing diagonal side-chain­side-chain interactions both between extension and core, and, for the 20-mer, within the core. The ST Y extension contains serine in the hydrogen-bonded positions; the Nterminal extension has threonine in the nonhydrogen-bonded positions, and the C-terminal extension has tyrosine in the nonhydrogen-bonded positions. This design allows diagonal interactions between Thr-2 and Leu-13, in the extension and core, respectively, of DP-ST Y, and between Thr-4 and Leu-15, in the extension and core, respectively, of DP-ST Y2. These interactions are analogous to the Thr Leu diagonal interactions in DP-TT, DP-TT2, DP-ST, and DP-ST2. The new extension also allows a diagonal interaction between two residues in the extension portions of 20-mer DP-ST Y2, Thr-2 and Tyr-17. Side-chain­side-chain NOEs consistent with all three of these diagonal interactions were observed. For each of these diagonal pairings, both side chains are sufficiently long that we expect a favorable contribution from the diagonal interaction(s) to overall -hairpin stability. Population analysis indicates that the behavior in the ST Y series is comparable to that seen in the ST and TA extension series: the -hairpin conformation of 16-mer DP-ST Y is significantly more stable than the -hairpin conformation of 12-mer DP, but the -hairpin conformation of 20-mer DP-ST Y does not differ significantly in terms of stability from 2 the -hairpin conformation of 16-mer DP-ST Y. These conclusions are supported by NH data for the ST Y series (see supporting information, www.pnas.org). These results provide further evidence against hypothesis 2. As an additional test of the competing hypotheses, we examined a set of hairpins on the basis of a less stable core sequence, the Tyr-2 3 Ala variant of DP. As indicated in the supporting information (www.pnas.org), this alteration leads to a considerable diminution of -hairpin stability. For two different extension series, TA and ST Y, the trend follows that observed for extension of DP: the 16-mer is significantly more stable than the 12-mer, but the 20-mer is not more stable than the 16-mer.

Discussion Our results suggest that there is an intrinsic limit on strand length in antiparallel -sheets, at least for some sequences. Starting from a two-stranded -sheet containing five-residue strands, we find a consistent increase in conformational stability on lengthening the strands to seven residues for four different extension sequences, but no further increase on further strand lengthening to nine residues for three of the four extension sequences. In the fourth case, all-threonine extensions, there may be additional stabilization on strand lengthening from seven to nine residues. Why should there be a discontinuous effect of strand lengthening on antiparallel -sheet stability? One explanation for this behavior is that as the strand length grows, so does a propensity within each strand to form -helix. [Proline and glycine are strong helix breakers, so it is very unlikely that an -helix would propagate through the central turn segment (42, 43)]. At some point, the intrastrand interactions that favor the helix begin to counterbalance the interstrand interactions that stabilize the -hairpin. Because -helical folding causes -proton chemical shifts to move upfield relative to the random coil position, in contrast to the downfield shift induced by -sheet folding (45, 46), the H-based population analysis is very sensitive to relatively small changes in the -helical propensity on strand lengthening. Alternatively, our observations could be explained by an increase in random coil population as the strands grow longer. However, it is not clear to us why the population of the

random coil state should increase with increasing strand length, in contrast to the expectation of increasing -helix population with increasing length, if the sequence is conducive. (The distinctive behavior of the all-threonine extensions in our studies may reflect threonine's combination of high -sheet propensity and low -helix propensity.) The existence of intrinsic limits on -strand length for a majority of possible strand sequences is consistent with the results of a statistical survey of protein crystal structures, which indicate that the prevalence of -strands decreases steadily as the strands grow longer (51, 52). In contrast, -helix prevalence increases as the number of residues grows to four or five. -Helix prevalence declines at greater lengths, but the decline is less precipitous than for -strands (51, 52). The insights provided by our model study are important for understanding how natural proteins fold, for designing new proteins (53), and for elucidating pathologically important -sheet aggregation processes (54, 55).
