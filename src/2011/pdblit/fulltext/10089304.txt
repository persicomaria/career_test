Bound-solvent structures for microgravity-, ground control-, gel- and microbatch-grown hen egg-white Ê lysozyme crystals at 1.8 A resolution
A number of methods can be used to improve the stability of the protein crystal-growth environment, including growth in microgravity without an air±liquid phase boundary, growth in gels and growth under oil (`microbatch'). In this study, X-ray data has been collected from and structures re®ned for crystals of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) grown using four different methods, liquid±liquid dialysis on Earth and in microgravity using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Advanced Protein Crystallization Facility (APCF) on board the NASA Space Shuttle Life and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission (STS-78), crystallization in agarose gel using a tube liquid±gel diffusion method and crystallization in microbatch under oil. A comparison of the overall quality of the X-ray data, the protein structures and especially the Ê bound-water structures has been carried out at 1.8 A. The lysozyme protein structures corresponding to these four different crystallization methods remain similar. A small improvement in the bound-solvent structure is seen in lysozyme crystals grown in microgravity by liquid±liquid dialysis, which has a more stable ¯uid physics state in microgravity, and is consistent with a better formed protein crystal in microgravity.

1. Introduction
The driving rationale behind microgravity protein-crystal growth is that the reduction of buoyancy convection and sedimentation effects could improve the internal order of the growing crystal (see, for example, Helliwell, 1988). Hence, resolution limit and crystal mosaicity have been investigated in detail (Boggon et al., 1998; Broutin et al., 1997; Chayen et al., 1996, 1997; Colapietro et al., 1992; Fourme et al., 1995; HelliÁ well et al., 1996; Ng et al., 1997; Ries-Kautt et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1996; Snell et al., 1995; Snell, Casseta et al., 1997; Snell, Boggon et al., 1997; Strong et al., 1992; Vaney et al., 1996). Since microgravity affects (stabilizes) ¯uid behaviour, it is surprising that the bound solvent has not been investigated. However, the effect on protein structure has been studied, e.g. for lysozyme (see Vaney et al., 1996), and none found. This paper reports an analysis, especially of the bound solvent, including comparison with hen egg-white (HEWL) crystal structures for crystals grown as ground controls for the microgravity experiment, in agarose gel and in microbatch under paraf®n oil. Comparative studies of two microgravity-grown and one ground-grown lysozyme crystals (Dong, Wang et al., 1998) showed that the ordered water molecules between protein molecules, which are bound by weak interactions, may have changed to some extent, involving in particular an increase in

the average numbers of hydrogen bonds per water molecule. More extensive studies and analyses have been undertaken and are presented here. This study also involves more accurate data, in particular the utilization of Mo K to essentially eliminate absorption variations in the crystal which are well known to be able to adversely affect atomic displacement parameters. Moreover, we used the essentially identical X-ray beam intensity conditions of a home laboratory X-ray source, which facilitates data set intercomparisons. The added signi®cance of investigating the gel- and microbatch-grown crystal structures is twofold. The gel matrix may engender a similar bene®t to that rendered by microgravity, i.e. in limiting solutal convection during the growth of protein crystals (Miller et al., 1992). Microbatch crystallization under oil is a new technique which allows little or no contact with the container walls. We would like to investigate whether growth in this medium is also bene®cial and whether paraf®n oil has any effect on the protein structure and solvent binding in comparison with `regular' crystal-growth methods.
2.2. Crystallization in gels

Protein crystallization using gels has been performed with a Â wide variety of protocols (Provost & Robert, 1991; GarcõaRuiz & Moreno, 1994). Here we have used a new method, the tube liquid±gel diffusion method (Dong, 1999), in order to obtain crystal growth with the least turbulence. HEWL crystals were grown in a gelled protein solution which consisted of 25 mg mlÀ1 lysozyme (Sigma, batch number L-6876, lot 53H7145), 0.2% agarose (Sigma, Type VII, of low gelling temperature), 4% NaCl (0.68 M), 4% MPD in acetate buffer (pH 4.5); the precipitating agent solution was 15% NaCl (2.57 M) and 15% MPD in buffer. The glass tube used was 6 cm tall with an inner diameter of 4 mm. Crystals of typical dimensions $0.7 Â 0.6 Â 0.6 mm grew within 7 d at room temperature.
2.3. Crystallization by the microbatch method under oil

2. Methods
2.1. Liquid±liquid dialysis in microgravity and on earth

Crystallization of the microgravity crystal studied here took place in the APCF onboard the NASA Space Shuttle's Life and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission (STS-78). Identical material and reactors were used for both microgravity and ground control experiments. The APCF consists of 48 crystallization experiments of different geometries; vapour diffusion, free interface diffusion and liquid±liquid dialysis (Bosch et al., 1992; Snyder et al., 1991). The liquid±liquid dialysis geometry was used here. This reactor consists of three chambers; one containing protein and buffer solutions, one containing buffer and one containing salt solution. The salt solution is brought into contact with the protein and buffer by a 90 rotation of a plug which also contains salt solution. Crystal nucleation and growth occurs as the salt diffuses into the protein volume. The reactor is deactivated by a further 90 rotation of the plug. A solution of 21 mg of hen egg-white lysozyme (crystallized three times, dialyzed and lyophilized powder of chicken egg-white lysozyme supplied by Sigma, batch number L-6876 , lot 53H7145) dissolved in 250 ml 0.04 M acetate buffer (pH 4.7) was used to ®ll the protein chamber (188 ml). The salt chambers (541 ml) were ®lled with 1.35 M NaCl and the buffer chamber (59 ml) with 0.04 M acetate buffer (pH 4.7). Sodium azide was also added to the protein and buffer solution as an antifungal agent (1.92 mg per 188 ml). Crystallization took place at 293 Æ 0.1 K for the microgravity case and at 293 Æ 1 K for the ground control case, in which the reactor was held within a polystyrene box in a temperature-controlled room. The reactor was held in a vertical orientation with the protein chamber uppermost, i.e. the least turbulent orientation (Snell et al., 1996). Crystals with typical dimensions $0.5 Â 0.5 Â 0.6 mm initially nucleated after 25 h, with reactor deactivation occurring at the end of the mission (i.e. after 15 d).

Crystallization by the microbatch method under oil as a general technique was initiated in order to save on the consumption of material. Samples are dispensed and incubated under oil which is used as an inert sealant to prevent evaporation of 1±2 ml drops consisting of a mixture of protein and crystallizing agents (Chayen et al., 1990, 1992, 1994). The batch method is mechanically and technically the simplest to set up of all the crystallization methods. In addition to preventing evaporation, the presence of oil also protects the samples from airborne contamination (which can cause excess unwanted nucleation). This enhances the cleanliness of the trials, thereby facilitating higher accuracy and reproducibility of the experiments (Chayen et al., 1993). Furthermore, the crystals are buoyed by the viscous oil and hence have very little or no contact with the container walls (Chayen, 1996, 1997, 1998). This mimics to some extent the effect of microgravity, in that there is little or no contact with the container walls, although the presence of oil does not prevent convection. It is thus likely to improve the quality of the resulting crystals. A solution containing 40 mg mlÀ1 of lysozyme (Sigma batch number L-6876, lot 65H7025, i.e. a different Sigma sample to the experiments described above) in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer pH 4.7 was mixed in an eppendorf tube with equal volumes of 12% (2.05 M) sodium chloride (BDH). The mixture was ®ltered through a 0.22 mm ®lter and 8 ml drops were manually dispensed under paraf®n oil using a Gilson micropipette. Over 20 identical drops were set up and, within a week, single crystals typically measuring 0.5 Â 0.4 Â 0.3 mm were obtained in most of the drops. Crystallization took place at a temperature of 291±293 K.
2.4. Data collection and processing

X-ray data collection for the microgravity-, ground control-, gel- and microbatch-grown HEWL crystals used an RU-200 X-ray rotating-anode source and Rigaku IIc IP area detector. In each case, only one crystal mounted at room temperature in a quartz capillary was used for data collection. An Mo K (! = Ê 0.71 A wavelength) target was used for data collection of the

² Calculated ratios of maximum and minimum transmision of the primary X-ray beam in each case. At Mo K " 9 0.1 mmÀ1 and at Cu K " 9 1 mmÀ1. Any absorption variations at Mo K for the microgravity and ground control case are essentially completely eliminated as a source of systematic error. ³ Inspection of the SCALEPACK image-to-image scale factors showed that essentially the full crystal volume was bathed throughout, i.e. the scales lay within a range of 0.88±1.17 (these indicate that the longest direction through the crystal of (0.52 + 0.352)1/2 = 0.61 mm may have taken the crystal slightly out of the X-ray beam for a part of the angular range; the relative B factors per image with respect to the ®rst one lay in the Ê range À2.4 to 1.9, which for these extremes would make a 2.1-fold change in intensities at 1.7 A resolution. § Inspection of the SCALEPACK image-to-image scale factors show that the slow-pass (40 min per degree) data images included the situation where the longest dimension of the ground control crystal was parallel to the incident X-ray beam and so the full crystal volume was bathed for a part of the angular range covered; for these diffraction images ($40 angle coverage) the diffraction image B factors relative to the ®rst image lay within Ê the range À2 to 1.5, which for these extremes would make a 1.8-fold change in intensities at 1.7 A for these ground control diffraction images as the extreme case. } Because of the larger volume of the ground-control crystal, compared with the microgravity-grown crystal, an additional very quick pass data set of images was collected i.e. exposure times of 30 min for   1.5 rotation (equivalent to 10 min for 0.5 rotation so as to capture saturated spots at low resolution. ²² For hIi/h'i the ®gure in parentheses is the value in the outer resolution   shell. ³³ Rmerge = jIi À hIija Ii , where Ii is the measured intensity of individual re¯ections and hIi the mean intensity of the symmetry-related measurements of this re¯ection.

microgravity and ground-control data sets and a Cu K (! = Ê 1.54 A wavelength) target was used for the gel- and microbatch-grown crystals. Ideally, Mo K radiation should also have been used for these last two cases, but unfortunately this was not possible. However, the Cu K to Mo K comparisons are nevertheless also of interest. The exposure times for the gel- and microbatch-grown image frames were reduced for the longer wavelength copper-anode source to compensate for the enhanced crystal sample scattering ef®ciency at Cu K. The X-ray generator settings were 50 kV and 120 mA for each case. A summary of the data-collection protocols and processing results are given in Table 1. In using a rather divergent conventional X-ray source beam ($ 0.5 ) in these evaluations, we are obviously not harnessing the bene®t that would accrue from any differences in crystal mosaicity with a non-divergent specially collimated synchrotron radiation beam and optimizable, for example, with a synchrotron radiation X-ray undulator (see Figs. 3 and 4 of Snell et al., 1995). The data were processed using DENZO and scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). The resulting Rmerge and completeness of each of the four data sets, in resolution shells, are shown in Table 2; consideration of Table 2 and the point at which the merging R factors rise above 20% led to data for the model re®nement being cut at Ê 1.8 A. Note that the illuminated volume of the microgravity crystal is about 0.7 times that of the ground control crystal and 0.6 times that of the gel-grown crystal. No adjustment of

exposure time was made to take account of these differences. In effect this slightly `disfavoured' the microgravity crystal compared with the two other crystals.
2.5. Model re®nement

The starting model for re®nement in each case was taken from the re®ned atomic coordinates (entry 193L) of HEWL obtained from the PDB (Vaney et al., 1996), i.e. the best Ê resolution structure of lysozyme yet re®ned (1.33 A). All water molecules were removed from this initial model. Ê Data from 20 to 1.8 A were used without any ' cutoff and 5% of the re¯ections were separated for use as a free R test È (Brunger, 1992a). This model was then re®ned using X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992b), ®rst with rigid-body re®nement, followed by simulated-annealing and atomic displacement parameter (ADP) re®nement and a number of rounds of positional and ADP re®nement and model rebuilding in O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1993, 1994). A solvent mask was incorporated during Ê re®nement, with a solvent density of 0.34 eÀ AÀ3 and a solvent Ê used. The PEAKMAX and WATPEAK radius of 0.25 A programs from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) were used to locate the water molecules at various stages of the re®nement. Water molecules were inserted in the models with an initial isotropic Ê B factor of 30 A2 if they formed at least one stereochemically Ê reasonable hydrogen bond (between 2.5 and 3.4 A) and were

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Comparison of the diffraction data

The intensities of the gel-grown crystal data set are improved signi®cantly both at low resolution and high resolution compared with the microgravity-, ground control- and microbatch-grown crystal data (Fig. 1). This arises partly from the larger illuminated crystal volume, which is a factor of two greater than the microgravity-grown crystal and a factor of ®ve greater than the microbatch-grown crystal values.

Although the illuminated crystal volume of the microgravity crystal is between 0.6 and 0.8 times that of the ground control crystal, the hIi/h'i values are essentially identical at medium to high resolution (Rmerge values in Table 2; Fig. 1). In another study, Strong et al. (1992) noted a reduction in background residuals in microgravity-grown lysozyme crystals. Ahari et al. (1997), for a small-molecule crystal, noted considerably reduced disorder diffuse X-ray scattering for their microgravity-grown crystal; this would not only improve (i.e. reduce) the '(I)s but also enhance the Bragg re¯ection intensities, both of which would improve hIi/h'i. The use of the different wavelengths (Mo K and Cu K) appears to favour the Cu K data sets, in that the gel-grown case is the best and the rather small microbatch-grown crystal still has similar Rmerge (Table 1) and hIi/h'i trends (Fig. 1).
3.2. Cation- (Na+) and anion- (ClÀ) binding sites

Figure 1

Average values of hIi/h'i plotted against 4sin2/!2 for the microgravity-, ground-control-, gel- and microbatch-grown crystals.

One cation-binding and one anion-binding site have been identi®ed in tetragonal HEWL; Dong et al. (1995) ascribed the cation to be a calcium ion and Vaney et al. (1996) assigned it to be a sodium ion. Bentley et al. (1993), in a study of Japanese quail egg-white lysozyme, also found a sodium ion in the cation-binding site. The position of the cation-binding site shows electron density in all the four structures presented here. However, in the microgravity, ground control and gel structures, the density has been identi®ed as a water based on its higher B factor and longer distances to surrounding atoms. In the microbatch-grown crystal structure, the side chain Ser72 has moved closer to the density peak of the cation-binding site than in the other three structures, and, therefore, no water molecule has been positioned there. Hence, the local protein structure around the position of the cation-binding site and the site itself are not conserved, whereas the Chinese and French HEWL structures (Dong et al., 1995; Dong, Wang et al., 1998; Vaney et al., 1996) show stronger cation binding at that position. The most likely explanation of this is that HEWL

3.4. Bound-solvent structure comparisons

obtained from different sources can have different sodium contents, so a strongly bound sodium ion occurs in crystals from lysozyme samples with a high sodium content. This has been investigated by atomic absorption spectroscopy demonstrating that the strongly bound sodium lysozyme sample has a high sodium ion content (Dong, Wang et al., 1998). There is then no sodium ion binding site in our HEWL samples, which must have lower sodium content than those presented in Vaney et al. (1996) and Dong, Wang et al. (1998). It is also of note that when a strongly bound cation is found, the local protein structure (part of a loop region) moves towards the cation compared with the weaker binding water case (Table 4).

In the microgravity-, ground control-, gel- and microbatch-grown lysozyme crystals 104, 92, 95 and 92 water molecules, respectively, were identi®ed in the asymmetric unit. The microgravity-grown structure has a greater number of waters than the gel-grown structure, and the gel-grown structure has a greater number of waters than the ground control- and microbatch-grown crystal structures. The distances of the water molecules from the nearest protein atom de®ne the primary and secondary solvent shells, whereby Ê waters closer than 3.4 A to the protein are considered to be in the primary hydration shell and those further away in the secondary hydration shell. The microgravity case has an increase in the numbers of both primary and secondary waters compared with the other three structures (Fig. 2). Overall, the gel-grown structure has a few more waters than the ground control- and microbatch-grown structures. More ordered waters are identi®ed in the primary hydration shell than the secondary hydration shell, which is as expected. 3.4.1. Bound-water B-factor analysis.

waters were principally in the primary hydration shell, with Ê average B factors of 29.8, 31.3, 30.7 and 32.3 A2 in the microgravity-, ground-control-, gel- and microbatch-grown cases, respectively. A water was considered common if there Ê was a distance of less than 1.0 A between it and a water from another structure, as determined using the program DISTANG (IUPAC±IUB Conventions, 1972) from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The microgravity case gives a percentage increase in intensity of these 59 conserved waters of 26, 15 and 47% at Ê 1.8 A owing to the lower B factors compared to the ground control, gel and microbatch cases, respectively, using equation (1), where ÁB is the difference in B factor,  is the angle of maximum diffraction, ! is the wavelength of X-rays and ÁI is their change in intensity.   2ÁBsin2  X 1 ÁI  exp !2 A mean B-factor analysis of the common waters between six pairings of the four structures was carried out. The microÊ gravity case showed a B-factor improvement of 1.3 A2 over the ground control waters found in common positions. Using equation (1) this corresponds to a 22% improvement in data Ê intensity at 1.8 A resolution from these waters (Table 6), i.e. since the bound waters are $10% of the ordered atoms in the crystal this would yield an overall intensity increase from the Ê crystal of 2.2% at the edge of the pattern (1.8 A). Table 6 summarizes the common water pairing, the B factors of each

water population and the improvement in their diffracted intensities owing to changes in B factor at the outer edge Ê (1.8 A) of the diffraction pattern. The B factors for the protein atoms have values 21.3, 21.9, Ê 20.3 and 21.7 A2 for the microgravity-, ground control-, geland microbatch-grown structures, respectively. Between the microgravity and ground control structures, both of which were re®ned against Mo K short-wavelength data, the difference in B factors of 0.6 compares with a ÁB for the common waters of 1.3 (Table 6). Combined with the increase in the number of bound waters for the microgravity, these are small but nevertheless consistent changes over the ground control. The largest difference between protein atom B values are those for the ground control (21.9) and the gel (20.3) cases, i.e. a ÁB of 1.6. For this pair, the common waters show a ÁB of 0.6. The ÁB of 0.6 is very small, although in the correct sense considering there are more bound waters in the gel case. The use of Cu K for the gel data must mean that the gel/groundcontrol comparison will be more vulnerable to errors than the microgravity/ground-control cases studied with the same short X-ray wavelength. Nevertheless, the gel case looks favourable compared with the ground control case, although inferior to the microgravity case (in terms of bound waters). The sensitivity of these B values and the small ÁB values to the re®nement software warranted further checks, although the use of X-PLOR here for the model re®nement for the four cases was the same as described in x2.5. The CCP4 protein model-re®nement program REFMAC has been used for the ground-control and microgravity cases in order to assess sensitivity. The small difference in B factors is still seen (1.3 in favour of the microgravity-grown structure, i.e. hBi for the microgravity case common waters of 32.2 compared with 33.5 for the ground-control case) now with 70 common waters between the structures rather than 69. In a ®nal re®nement check, using the common 10 115 re¯ections and REFMAC, these values were 32.1 for the microgravity case and 33.4 for the ground-control case, again then with a ÁB of 1.3 in favour of the microgravity-grown structure. 3.4.2. Total sum of hydrogen bonds involving the bound waters. Ordered water molecules are connected with the protein atoms or other water molecules by hydrogen bonds. A sum of the total number of hydrogen bonds formed by the water molecules was 241, 221, 225 and 231, respectively, for the microgravity-, ground control-, gel- and microbatchgrown crystal structures. More hydrogen bonds lead to a more stable structure and a higher quality protein crystal. This, then, is evidence at the atomic level that microgravity can improve the quality of protein crystals via an improved bound-solvent structure. However, since water molecules exchange rapidly with the solvent, it is puzzling that a more ordered bound-solvent structure should be preserved on the return to earth of a microgravity-grown crystal. Most likely, then, is that in the microgravity-grown crystal the weaker intermolecular interactions, i.e. involving bound solvent, are more clearly resolved. Once `better formed' in space, the crystal remains `better formed' on its return to earth.

control data sets. A comparison of the four HEWL crystal structures has shown that, at this resolution, the protein structures remain very similar. One difference was noted in that the Na+ ion site was not conserved in the microbatch structure, but overall there is no signi®cant impact on the protein structure for the crystal grown under paraf®n oil. However, the ordered water molecules, which are bound by weak interactions, alter between the structures, with the microgravity case indicating a better ordered bound solvent (for the common waters) and having an increased number of bound waters, and the gel-grown case approaching this. These results are in accordance with the expected stabilities of the ¯uid in liquid±liquid geometry in microgravity, as used here [i.e. vapour-diffusion droplet geometry, and the possibility of Marangoni convection have both been avoided (Chayen et al. (1997)], compared with situations of convective ¯ow of liquids and/or sedimentation of nuclei or crystals on earth. A better formed protein crystal has resulted where the weaker intermolecular interactions, i.e. involving bound solvent, are more clearly resolved. It is interesting that the microgravity crystal used was smaller than the earth-grown ground-control crystal and yet had very similar hIi/h'i distributions at medium to high resolution; this is consistent with the results of Strong et al. (1992) (also on lysozyme) and of Ahari et al. (1997) (for a small-molecule crystal in microgravity versus ground comparison). Our results show that the bound-solvent structure, which comprises $10% of the ordered atoms, can be improved via microgravity protein crystal growth, although the changes are small. Protein crystals with higher solvent contents may be a particular category of protein crystal that might bene®t more from the microgravity environment (Dong, Pan et al., 1998) and also crystals where there are rather few lattice intermolecular interactions, thus making the whole crystal better formed.
