Molecular modeling based on the X-ray crystal structure of the Tang-Ghosh heptapeptide inhibitor 1 (OM99-2) of BACE led to the design and synthesis of a series of constrained P1 analogues. A cyclopentane ring was incorporated in 1 spanning the P1 Ala methyl group and the adjacent methylene carbon atom of the chain. Progressive truncation at the P2-P4 sites led to a potent truncated analogue 5 with good selectivity over Cathepsin D. Using the same backbone replacement concept, a series of cyclopentane, cyclopentanone, tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, and pyrrolidinone analogues were synthesized with considerable variation at the P and P sites. The cyclopentanone and 2-pyrrolidinone analogues 45 and 57 showed low nM BACE inhibition. X-ray cocrystal structures of two analogues 5 and 45 revealed excellent convergence with the original inhibitor 1 structure while providing new insights into other interactions which could be exploited for future modifications.
Introduction A major histopathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is extracellular plaques of deposited -amyloid (A ) in the brain. There is compelling evidence that -amyloid (A ) plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, either as extracellular or intracellular deposits, or as small soluble aggregates.1 Reducing the production of A or increasing its clearance therefore are attractive strategies for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.2-6 The generation of A depends on two consecutive enzymatic steps. The endoproteolytic cleavage of -amyloid precursor protein (APP) is initiated by the membrane-bound aspartic protease BACE (Asp-2, memapsin 2), which exhibits all the characteristics assigned to the -secretase activity.7-11 BACE releases the large ectodomain of APP (APPs ) and produces a membrane-bound C99 fragment. This latter is then the substrate of -secretase for the release of A .12 BACE is considered as an ideal target for small molecule inhibitors, with the ultimate aim of developing an effective therapeutic agent.13-16 The first crystal structure of the extracellular domain of BACE complexed with a synthetic heptapeptide inhibitor (1) harboring an unnatural hydroxyethylene spacer as a transition state mimic was reported by Hong, Ghosh, and Tang.17 This disclosure, followed by additional crystal structures of BACE with18-22 and without19 complexed inhibitor, as well as studies on the substrate specificity22-24 provide valuable insights for structurebased design of inhibitors. Indeed, Ghosh and Tang21,25,26

have subsequently reported the synthesis of low nM inhibitors with related structures and reduced molecular weights by appropriate truncation and functional modification of the original lead structure. Reports from other laboratories27 on inhibitors incorporating the hydroxyethylene28-31 transition state mimetic group followed. Further peptidomimetic isosteres that have successfully been implemented for inhibitors of BACE are statine,32-34 bis-statine,35 phenylnorstatine,36,37 hydroxymethylcarbonyl,38 and hydroxyethylamine.39-40 Clearly, the inhibition of BACE relying on conceptually novel approaches to structure-based design presents a major intellectual and operational challenge. Herein, we report our results on the design and synthesis of novel nM inhibitors of BACE. Molecular modeling based on the X-ray structure of 1 with BACE17 led us to a subtle modification at the P1 Ala position with the introduction of a fused cyclopentane ring (Figure 1). Indeed, an energy minimized CP (cyclopentano) analogue of 1, in which the methyl group of the P1 Ala and the adjacent methylene carbon atom were joined as a constrained entity, was well matched with the X-ray conformation of 1. Our first objective was to ascertain the viability of the CP as a backbone replacement for a segment of the hydroxyethylene isostere. As a proof of concept, we prepared three analogues, 3-5, of 1 incorporating a CP ring, with progressive truncation at the P3-P4 C-terminus (Figure 1). We also prepared a truncated acyclic analogue 2 as a control for compound 5. Results and Discussion Chemistry. CP/1 and P Truncation.

improvement, affording 6 in 72% yield as a 5:1 mixture of isomers (Scheme 1). Conversion to the mixed acetal 7 and Lindlar reduction afforded the cis-ester 8 which was subjected to Pd-catalyzed cycloannulation with 2-(acetoxymethyl)-3-allyltrimethylsilane 9, according to Trost's method43 to give the corresponding exo-methylene CP adduct as a mixture of epimers. Treatment with sodium methoxide in MeOH resulted in complete epimerization to the enantiopure trans-isomer 10 in excellent overall yield. Oxidative cleavage with sodium metaperiodate and catalytic osmium tetroxide led to the cyclopentanone analogue 11 which was deoxygenated by transformation to the tosylhydrazone and treatment with catecholborane44 to give the core CP intermediate 12 in excellent overall yield. The structural and configurational confirmation of 12 was ascertained from a single-crystal X-ray analysis. We found it more practical to introduce the P2-P4 subunits first, then to elongate the chain on the P sites

systematically. This protocol of stepwise addition of protected amino acids gave more consistent results and better yields compared to a block coupling with di- or tripeptides. Thus, 12 was hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, which was coupled with the respective peptidic precursors to give 13-15 as benzyl esters in good to excellent yields. Removal of the N-Boc and acetal groups by acid hydrolysis provided the corresponding amino alcohols which were individually coupled with BocAsn(NTr)-OH to give 16-18, respectively. Cleavage of the N-Boc group and coupling with Boc-Val-OH led to the respective products 19-21, which were further elaborated to the protected full length CP oligopeptides 22-24. Treatment with TFA, followed by catalytic hydrogenation afforded the desired constrained P1-P4 analogue 3 of 1 as well as its P3-P4 truncated congeners 4 and 5 (Figure 1, Scheme 1). For comparison of biological data we also prepared the P3-P4 truncated peptide analogue 2.45 P2-P4 Modification and P Truncation of CP/1. We pursued a new series of truncated analogues maintaining the CP constraint and the P2 Ala-OH terminus, while changing the P2 Asn residue to Met. Tang and Ghosh26 have shown that this replacement in a shortened analogue of 1 had a small beneficial effect, possibly also diminishing the hydrophilic nature of the original inhibitor. Thus, the common CP intermediate 10 was transformed to the corresponding Ala-OCH2CCl3 ester 25, followed by liberation of the amine and coupling with Boc-Met-OH to give 28 (Scheme 2). Further chain elongation by coupling with Ac-Leu-OH afforded 31 and eventually the free acid 34. The keto and deoxy CP analogues 35 and 36 were prepared following the same protocol starting with 11 and 12 respectively as shown in Scheme 2. Sequential single amino acid coupling was found to minimize racemization compared to alternative dipeptide coupling strategies which required longer reaction times at room temperature. To assess the importance of the P2 amino acid residue, we also synthesized the CP Val-OH analogue 40 (Scheme 2). Our intention was also to diminish the peptidic character of the CP series. Toward this end, we replaced the P3-P4 Glu-Phe residues by a simple butyramide moiety, while maintaining the new prototypical CP structures represented by 45, 46, and 47 (Scheme 3). The intermediate 11 was transformed to the corresponding Val-butyramide derivative 41. Cleavage of the N-Boc and acetal groups and coupling with Boc-MetOH gave 43 which was cleaved to the amine and further extended with Ac-LeuOH to give the intended oxo-CP target 45. Following a similar procedure, the CP intermediate 12 was elaborated via 42 and 44 to give the P2 Ala butyramide analogue 46. The CP Val butyramide 47 was prepared from precursor 40. To assess the importance of the P2 amino acid residues in this series, and the implication of a constrained CP subunit, we also prepared the truncated n-butyramide analogue 50, as well as the acyclic analogue 5145 (Scheme 3). In an effort to probe the carbocyclic CP space in the P and P2-P3 truncated analogues shown in Scheme 3, we also prepared four heterocyclic variants.45 Thus, the pyrrolidine 53 and lactam analogues 55 and 57 as well as tetrahydrofuran analogue 59 were prepared by

standard coupling with the appropriate amino acid partners as described for the CP analogues (Scheme 4). Biological Data and Structure-Activity Relationships. Truncation of the P Side. The suitability of the CP moiety as a rigid dipeptide isostere of the known inhibitor 1 and its P-truncated variants was validated since analogues 3-5 maintained substantial inhibitory activity as shown in Table 1. The full length analogue 3 has an IC50 of 16 nM, about an order of magnitude weaker than 1, but, remarkably, the P4P3 truncated CP compound 5 is only 3-fold less potent than its counterpart 2. While the activity on BACE hardly changed with stepwise elimination of amino acids from the P side, the Cathepsin D (CathD) activity decreased sharply. Hence, a substantial increase in selectivity toward BACE is afforded by the combination of the P truncation with the CP modification, while maintaining decent potency. The binding of the P3 Glu and P4 Phe groups to BACE has been shown to be affected by the nature of the P2 residue. In the OM00-3

(P2 ) Val) crystal structure18 the P3 Glu and P4 Phe groups make clearly defined interactions with the enzyme. In comparison, these residues are not well defined in the OM99-2 (P2 ) Ala) complex, suggesting that they are relatively mobile. This observation can be interpreted as being the result of a stabilization of the position of the P3 and P4 residues due to the more tightly bound P2 Val. Compounds 3-5 have an alanine in P2, and the contribution of the P3-P4 groups to binding is most probably minimal. Moreover, with the P3 AlaGlu-OH analogue 4, the loss of the P4 Phe interactions is likely compensated by a favorable electrostatic interaction between the terminal carboxylate group and the guanidinium moiety of Arg128. The observed 60-fold decrease of the CathD activity in going from 3 to 4 indicates a stronger contribution of the P4 groups to CathD binding, which is not compensated by new interactions. Since Arg128 is substituted by a valine in Cath D,46 the electrostatic interaction proposed hereabove for BACE cannot take place.

The P2 Ala-OH analogue 5 afforded suitable cocrystals with the enzyme that were amenable to an X-ray analysis at 2.25 Å resolution (Figure 2). The superposition of the cocrystal structures of 5 and 1 with the enzyme showed good agreement along the peptidic

backbone encompassed by the P2-P2 residues, confirming that the rigid CP moiety does not alter substantially the positioning of the P2 alanine and of the modified transition state mimic. Small positional shifts of 0.60.8 Å are observed for P1-P2 atoms of analogue 5 relative to the corresponding 1 atoms. The distance between the catalytic aspartic acid residues and the hydroxyethylene isostere are similar in the OM99-2 complex (2.4 Å to Asp32 O1, 2.8 Å to Asp228 O2) and in the complex with analogue 5 (2.6 Å to Asp32 O1, 2.6 Å to Asp228 O2). A remarkable feature of the X-ray of 5 are the two specific interactions of the Ala carboxylate with Tyr198 and Arg128. In the OM99-2 complex, the carbonyl oxygen atom of the P3-P4 amide bond is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl of Tyr198. In the complex with analogue 5, one of the carboxylate oxygens is mimicking this interaction, while in addition, the second oxygen forms a tight interaction with Arg128. This is possible due to a more than 3 Å move of the Arg

side-chain when compared to its position in the structure of 1 (Figure 2). Thus, the X-ray data show that the loss of the P3 group in the Ala-OH analogue 5 can be compensated by new polar and electrostatic interactions between Tyr198, Arg128 and the free carboxylate of the inhibitor, explaining the relatively small effect of the truncation on the inhibitory potency. As already pointed out previously, the loss of activity of compound 5 against CathD can, at least in part, be ascribed to the Arg128 to Val substitution in CathD.46 SAR in P2. On the basis of the subsite specificity published by Turner23 and in accordance with published SAR data,26 one can assume that it is beneficial to replace P3 Val by Leu, and that the P2 Asn can be replaced by the less hydrophilic Met without loss of activity. The mentioned published data also revealed that replacement of P4 Glu in 1 by a hydrogen resulted in only about 20-fold loss of activity, suggesting that the P4 residue can be truncated without too much penalty. Indeed, exchanging the P4-P2 residues in 5 from GluValAsn to AcLeuMet as in 36, led to only about 15times lower inhibitory activity than 5. However, as expected due to the more hydrophobic S2 pocket in CathD,46 the inhibitory activity for CathD was increased. Further studies were pursued using 36 as reference compound. Thus, in accordance with the results of Turner23 replacement of the P2-Ala by Val led to improved activity (compare 36 versus 40, 46 versus 47). A Val residue was shown to fill the S2 pocket better than Ala.18 Capping the carboxylate as a butylamide further improved activity on BACE (compare 36 versus 46, and 40 versus 47). Deletion of P2 as in 50 resulted in only weak activity, while additional shortening of 50 on the N-terminal side going from Ac-Leu to 4-methylpentoyl (as a mimic of Leu) led to a compound without activity. Therefore, 47 was chosen as a suitable reference for an SAR study on the cyclopentyl peptidomimetic moiety. SAR of the Cyclopentyl Peptidomimetic Moiety. The water-filled S1 pocket17 suggested an extension of the CP concept toward more polar analogues. An obvious example is the cyclopentanone 45 (Table 3). From a study of a cocrystal X-ray structure, the ring carbonyl of 45 forms a network of hydrogen bonds via water molecules to several residues lining the hydrophilic S1 pocket (see discussion below). This modified pattern of water-mediated interactions contributes to only a small improvement of the activity on BACE compared to 5. On the other hand, the activity on CathD was decreased

(Table 3), which might be explained by two facts. First, the S1 pocket in CathD is more lipophilic than in BACE (Arg235 in BACE corresponds to Val238 in CathD), hence less favorable to accommodate a polar carbonyl group. Second, the Val332 in BACE corresponds to Ile320 in CathD, resulting in a smaller pocket possibly leading to unfavorable steric interactions. The cyclopentanone derivative 45 was cocrystallized in BACE and an X-ray structure was solved to 2.05 Å resolution. Overall, the binding conformation of 45 corresponded well with the binding conformation of 5 (Figure 3a). In particular, the positioning of the P1 group and the modified transition state isostere in 45 is, within experimental error, identical in the two complexes. As mentioned above, the P2 residue has been shown to influence the binding of the P3 and P4 side chains. A structural comparison with the OM00-318 (P2 ) Val) complex is therefore interesting (Figure 3b). It shows that the P2 Val binding is not affected by the rigid CP modification, and that the butylamide cap takes the place of the P3 Glu of OM00-3. The hydrogenbonded interaction to Tyr198 is maintained in analogue 45. Furthermore, the nitrogen atom of the butylamide is H-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Pro70 and its alkyl chain is in van der Waals contact to Pro70, Tyr71 and Thr72 of the enzyme flap, thereby contributing to the stabilization of the closed conformation of the enzyme. An analysis of the solvent structure in the S1 pocket, as observed in the published complexes with OM99-2 and OM00-318 and in this study with compounds 5 and 45, shows that it is affected by the nature of the groups in position P2 and P1 of the inhibitors, and by Arg235,

whose orientation varies in response to the bulkiness and chemical nature of the P2 substituent. Nevertheless, two waters in the S1 pocket are conserved in all four complexes, and two additional waters are found in three complexes. As depicted in Figure 4a, the introduction of the cyclopentyl moiety in P1 (compound 5 compared to 1) hardly effects the pattern of conserved water molecules. In contrast, introduction of the ring carbonyl group and replacement of P2 Asn by Met (compound 45) result in major changes in the interaction pattern (Figure 4b). The carbonyl oxygen forms hydrogen bonds with two conserved waters. The movement of Arg235 (now forming a hydrogen bond with one of the waters) together with the spatially more demanding carbonyl displaces two water molecules. With the observed binding pattern of the carbonyl group in the cocrystal complex of 45 and BACE (Figure 4), we were not surprised that the lactam 57 which deployed its carbonyl group in the same direction exhibited almost equal inhibition compared to 45 and significantly better than the isomeric lactam 55. The slight additional gain in activity for 57 might result from favorable conformational changes due to steric constraints imposed by the rigid lactam motif. The substantial loss of activity of the oxa-analogue 59 and the isomeric lactam 55 might be explained by different conformational preferences due to the introduction of electronegative groups adjacent to the amide. In addition, the loss of activity for BACE of compound 55 is consistent with the negative effect of a hydrophobic group in the hydrophilic S1 environment. The inhibition of CathD, which comprises a hydrophobic S1 pocket, is much less affected by these changes. The loss of activity of the tertiary amine 53 is more difficult to explain. Most likely the positive charge is substantially influencing

the water-mediated interaction pattern in S1 resulting in less favorable interactions. A comparable effect of the ring carbonyl was found in the P2-Ala-OH series (Table 4): the keto derivative 35 showed similar activity on BACE as the unsubstituted compound 36, while the activity for CathD was decreased. In agreement with the above-mentioned results for 55, the lipophilic methylene derivative 34 exhibited an almost complete loss of activity for BACE, while it was still active on CathD. Conclusion We have demonstrated the validity of introducing a carbocyclic constraint in the hydroxyethylene subunit of the original Tang-Ghosh BACE inhibitor 1. A cocrys-

tal structure of the CP AlaOH analogue 5 with the enzyme showed a good match with 1. Introduction of a keto group in the CP ring of P truncated analogues as in 45 results in excellent BACE activity (IC50 10nM) as well as a 5-fold activity loss against CathD. A cocrystal structure of 45 with BACE shows excellent superposition with 1a. Heterocyclic replacements of the CP unit resulted in the single digit nanomolar lactam inhibitor 57. This compound exhibits an at least 7-fold selectivity toward BACE over CathD. Disappointingly, despite the high potency in the enzymatic assay (IC50 < 10 nM), the compound exhibited an only weak activity (IC50 0.9 µM) in the cellular assay (A -production in CHO cells transfected with APPwt). All other inhibitors showed even lower, mostly nonrelevant inhibition at 10 µM concentration.45 The character of the compounds is still peptidic and is limiting penetration across cell membranes. Although much remains to be done, the results obtained so far demonstrate that the combination of truncation and functional manipulation in hydroxyethylene transition state mimetics can produce potent inhibitors of BACE with excellent potential for selectivity over CathD. Experimental Section
Chemistry. Solvents were distilled under positive pressure of dry argon before use and dried by standard methods; THF and ether, from Na/benzophenone; CH2Cl2 and toluene, from CaH2. All commercially available reagents were used without further purification. All reactions were performed under argon atmosphere. NMR (1H, 13C) spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX-300 and ARX-400 spectrometers in CDCl3 or CD3OD or D2O with solvent resonance as the internal standard. Lowand high-resolution mass spectra were recorded on VG Micromass, AEIMS 902, or Kratos MS-50 spectrometers using fast atom bombardment (FAB). The purity of the target compounds was determined to be >95% by LC/MS obtained on a Finnigan Surveyor MSQ spectrometer. Purity of the compounds was determined by method [A] Alltech Prevail C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate using a gradient of 20-90% acetonitrile-water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and method [B] Alltech Prevail C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) at 0.5 mL/min flow rate using 65% methanol-water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Optical rotations were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter in a 1 dm cell at ambient temperature. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on Merck 60F 254 precoated silica gel plates. Flash column chromatography was performed using (40-60 µm) silica gel at increased pressure.

Modeling of Compounds in BACE. A 10 Å shell around the inhibitor in the BACE OM99-2 cocrystal structure (PDB ref 1FKN) was used for calculations. In this binding site model the Monte Carlo docking/energy minimization protocol of the MCDOCK routine in the QXP program47 (within the Flow96 package) was applied. Depending on the size and flexibility of the ligands 1000 or 2000 search and energy minimization cycles were performed in order to ensure an in depth conformational search and the exploration of different possible binding modes. Enzyme Inhibition Measurements. Materials: Recombinant human BACE (SwissProt accession number P56817, amino acids 1-453 + a thrombin-cleavable C-kappa tag) was produced in-house using Sf9 insect cells. The proenzyme was activated autocatalytically at pH 4.5. Human proCathepsin D (SwissProt accession number P07339) was expressed in Sf9 cells, purified, and autoactivated by incubation at pH 3.7. Peptide substrates were obtained from Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland, and all other biochemicals were obtained from Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland. Enzyme assays: Human BACE activity was assayed in 100 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.5, containing 0.1% CHAPS, using Mca-SEVNLDAEFK(DNP)-OH (3 µM), and Cathepsin D activity was measured in 100 mM formate buffer, pH 3.1, using Mca-GKPILFFRLK(DNP)-D-R-NH2 (2 µM). Test substances were serially diluted from 10 µM to 10 nM, inhibition assays were done in black 96-wellplates (Costar) by adding the respective enzyme in assay buffer. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and residual enzymatic activity was measured after addition of substrate in a Spectramax Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). IC50 values were calculated using the Microsoft Excel extension XL-fit.
