Crystals of a sarcoplasmic Ca `+-binding protein from the protochordate amphioxus have been grown from solutions of ammonium sulfate. The crystals are orthorhombic, space group C222,, with unit cell axes a = 59*6( 1) L%, = 81.3( 1) A and c = 82*4( 1) 8. There is one b molecule in the asymmetric unit. The crystals diffract beyond 2,5 A and show less than 20 y0 decline in diffraction intensities after a three day exposure to X-rays from a laboratory rotating anode source. Keywords: Calcium-binding protein; crystallization; protein crystallography

Sarcoplasmic Ca2 + -binding proteins (SCP$) are small, acidic, high affinity Ca2+-binding proteins found in the muscle of various invertebrates, including crustacea, annelids, mollusks and protochordates. Sequence studies of a number of these proteins have shown that they belong to the family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (Cox, 1989). The biological function of SCPs is not known. These proteins occur in multiple forms in invertebrates; for example, clam and oyster contain at least three isoforms (Wnuk et al., 1982), while earthworm, crayfish, lobster and shrimp contain two isoforms (Jauregui-Adell et al., 1989; Takagi & Konishi, Wnuk & Takagi et al., 1986; 1984a,b; Jauregui-Adell, 1983). These isoforms differ by only a limited number of amino acid changes in the sequences. Four isotypes of SCP from the protochordate amphioxus (Branch&stoma lanceolatum) have been isolated and sequenced (Takagi et al., 1986; Takagi &, Cox, 1990). Each is a single polypeptide chain t Present address: Biocryst, Inc., Birmingham, AL, U.S.A. $ Abbreviations used: SCP, sarcoplasmic calciumbinding protein.

that contains 185 amino acid residues and has a molecular mass of approximately 21,300. The two major isoforms, SCP I and II, differ from each other by seven amino acid substitutions, in a 17-residue segment, in the NH,-terminal portion of the protein (positions 20 to 36). SCP III and IV differ by only one amino acid from SCP I: SCP III has a methionine at position 20 instead of tyrosine, and SCP IV has asparagine at position 23 instead of aspartic acid. The reaction between antibodies raised against each of the two major isoforms and the two antigens is indistinguishable, indicating that the substitutions occur in regions that are either non-immunogenic, or that are buried inside the protein (Takagi
et al., 1986).

Amphioxus SCP has three Ca'+-binding sites of high affinity: two Ca"-specific sites and one Ca'+-Mg2+ mixed site (Takagi et al., 1986). Sequence homology of amphioxus SCP with Ca +-binding proteins of known three-dimensional structure suggests that, like other invertebrate SCPs, they originally contained four Ca2+-binding domains with the so-called EF-hand structure (Kretsinger & Nickolds, 1973). Three EF-hand type Ca'+-binding domains (I, II and III) have been predicted by sequence homology with related

(`a'+-binding proteins. The portion of the sequence that corresponds to domain IV has had a number of amino acid replacements and deletions and does not bind (`a'+. Although the seven a,mino acid differences between the t,wo ma.jor isoforms (SW I and TT) occur in the first Cla2+-binding doma,in. the metal-binding properties are not affected (Takagi rt al.. 1986). The structure of a number of intracellular (:a2' -binding proteins has been determined at atomic resolution, including parvalbumin (Declercq et nl., 1988; Swain rt al., 1989; Kumar et (~1.. 1990). 9 kDa calbindin (Szebenyi & Moffat. 1986). troponin (' (Herzberg bz James; 1988; Satyshur et d., 1988). calmodulin (Habu rt nl., 1988). oncomodulin calcium (Ahmed Pt al., 1990) and a sarcoplasmic binding protein from the sandworm Srrpis diz)ersicolor (Cook Pt al., 1991). In all of these proteins. except ,Ve,reis WP, there are either one or two pairs of (`a* + -binding sites. Serris 8CP utilizes domains 1. 111 and TV for Ca 2+-binding. and the crystal strutsture shows major differences in domains I and 11 compared with the structures of pairs of loops determined in other Ca2+-binding proteins (Cook rt (cl.. 1991). The non-binding loop in domain II of iVPreis SW maintains some of the same structural features loop. but there are also of a functional Ca `+-binding some important differences. Although the nonfunct.ional domain (IV) in amphioxus KCP would be expected to show some of the same feat,ures seen in ,verui,s SCP, the fact that the non-functional domain is at the terminus of the molecule, rather than in the middle. suggests that there may be other changes in conformation. Furthermore. unlike over& SCP. in which the three-metal-binding sit,es will bind either Ca*+ or Mg2+. amphioxus SW has one metal binding site that will accommodate eit,her Ca2+ or 2 + and t.wo that are specific for (:a'+. From the Mg use of sequence data only, it is not possible to assign the domains that differentially bind the two ions. Elucidation of the st)ruct,ure, and comparison with ,Verei<s SCP, should provide information about t.hc geometrical requirements for Mg2+ binding by proteins. SCPs from amphioxus (isot'ypes I and II) were isolated and purified as described by Takagi et al. (1986). For crystallization experiments, t.he Iyophilized material was dissolved in distilled water containing 2.5 mM-CaCl,. Crystals of the SW 11 isot,ype were obtained by the hanging drop method. The drops consisted of 1 ~1 of a solution containing of distilled wat,er and of SCP/ml 15 mg 2.5 mN-CaCl,, plus 1 PI of a solution containing 549,, saturated ammonium sulfate in 0.05 M-Tris buffer (pH 8-8). These drops were equilibrated against, 1 ml of a solution containing 54(?;, ammonium sulfate in (kO.3 M-Tris buffer (pH 8%). After three days at 24°C. orthorhombic prisms wit,h dimensions of up to 06 x 0.15 x @15 mm were obtained. Tn an effort to obtain even larger crystals, a macroscopic seeding technique was used. However. all attempts at seeding gave many small crystals unsuitable for X-ray work. For X-ray studies, crystals are trans-
