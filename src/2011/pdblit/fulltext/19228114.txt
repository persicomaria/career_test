Lipocalins are a broad family of proteins identified initially in eukaryotes and more recently in Gram-negative bacteria. The functions of lipocalin or lipid-binding proteins are often elusive and very diverse. Recently, we have determined the structure of GrlR (global regulator of LEE repressor), which plays a key role in the regulation of LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) proteins. GrlR adopts a lipocalin-like fold that is composed of an eightstranded -barrel followed by an -helix at the C-terminus. GrlR has a highly hydrophobic cavity region and could be a potential transporter of lipophilic molecules. To verify this hypothesis, we carried out structure-based analysis of GrlR, determined the structure of the lipid­GrlR complex and measured the

binding of lipid to recombinant GrlR by ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry). In addition, we identified phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine as the endogenously bound lipid species of GrlR using electrospray-ionization MS. Furthermore, we have shown that the lipid-binding property of GrlR is similar to that of its closest lipocalin structural homologue, -lactoglobulin. Our studies demonstrate the hitherto unknown lipid-binding property of GrlR. Key words: -barrel protein, global regulator of LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) repressor (GrlR), lipid, lipocalin, type III secretion system (T3SS).

INTRODUCTION

Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli and enteropathogenic E. coli are the two pathogenic E. coli strains that are responsible for diseases like diarrhoea and haemorrhagic colitis in humans, and belong to the family of attaching-and-effacing pathogens. During infection, these pathogens use the T3SSs (type III secretion systems) to inject effector proteins into the host cells and hijack the normal host-cell function to benefit the bacteria. The components and related proteins of T3SSs are encoded by 41 genes, organized in five major operons named LEE1 (locus of enterocyte effacement 1)­LEE5. GrlR (global regulator of LEE repressor) is a regulatory protein that plays a major role in the regulation of LEE proteins through its interaction with GrlA, another key regulator. The structure of GrlR was reported in a previous study [1]. Structural analysis of GrlR revealed the presence of a hydrophobic cavity in its -barrel architecture, a feature most commonly observed in lipocalins. Lipocalins are a widespread family of proteins identified in eukaryotes and in Gram-negative bacteria [2,3]. Lipocalins are the carriers of lipophilic molecules, but their functions are often elusive and very diverse [4]. The amino-acid sequences of lipocalins are poorly conserved, with the exception of a general sequence signature, namely a GXW motif at the N-terminus [5­7]. However, GrlR contains a GXY motif at the N-terminus instead of the highly conserved GXW motif. Lipocalins play important roles in cryptic colouration, enzymatic synthesis and pheromone transport; in addition, they have been

implicated in immune-response regulation and modulation of cellular homoeostasis [8]. The lipocalin fold comprises an eightstranded -barrel followed by an -helix at the C-terminus [6,9]. Blc was the first bacterial lipocalin that was characterized structurally from E. coli [10]. The most prominent structural feature of the lipocalin fold is the presence of a large cupshaped cavity within the -barrel and a loop scaffold at its entrance. The selectivity of lipocalin is determined by the aminoacid composition of the cavity and loop scaffold, as well as by its overall size and conformation [11]. GrlR shares a very high structural similarity with other well-characterized lipocalins, which prompted us to investigate the lipid-binding property of GrlR. In the present study, we report the identification and characterization of the lipid-binding property of GrlR, as a continuation of our efforts to understand the structure and function of GrlR. On the basis of structural analysis combined with literature searches, we hypothesize that LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) is probably the candidate substrate that interacts with the hydrophobic cavity of GrlR. To verify this hypothesis, we have determined the crystal structure of the LPA­GrlR complex and performed ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry) experiments using LPA and GrlR. Furthermore, we have studied the lipidbinding property of GrlR and compared this with its lipocalin structural homologues. Subsequently, we have identified the physiologically relevant lipid species for GrlR using an MS approach. Our studies demonstrate the lipid-binding property of GrlR and identify the physiologically relevant family of lipid

EXPERIMENTAL Protein purification and crystallization

Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, which then were grown in Luria­Bertani medium at 37 C to an attenuance (D600 ) of 0.6. A 1 litre volume of culture was induced with 100 M isopropyl -D-thiogalactoside and incubation was continued overnight at 20 C. Then, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6891 g for 15 min at 4 C and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer [50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2mercaptoethanol and one tablet of CompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics)]. The protein was purified in three steps, using DEAE-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences), Ni-NTA (Ni2+ -nitrilotriacetate) (Qiagen) and SuperdexTM 75 gelfiltration columns (GE Healthcare, Life Sciences) respectively. The His6 fusion tag was not cleaved. Drops containing 1 l of GrlR­lipid complex (4 mg/ml) and 1 l of reservoir solution were equilibrated by hanging-drop vapour diffusion at 21 C. The best crystals were grown from 25 % (v/v) ethylene glycol, 4 % (v/v) 2-methylpropan-2-ol and 4 % (v/v) trifluoroethanol (i.e. the same conditions as for the apoprotein), with the protein in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl. Crystals, measuring approx. 0.2 mm in length, grown over the course of 3 days, belonged to space group P21 21 21 with a = 43.73 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm), b = 66.02 Å and c = 83.46 Å, and contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The Matthews coefficient [12] was 2.2 Å3 /Da, giving a solvent content of 45 %. The X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1.

Crystals were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution supplemented with 40 % (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash-cooled at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected at Beamline X29A (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, U.S.A.) using a Quantum 4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). A total of 180 images with 1 oscillation were collected at a wavelength of 1.1 Å. All the datasets were processed using HKL-2000 software (HKL Research), as described in [13]. The structure was determined using co-crystallized protein crystals by the molecular-replacement method using the Phaser program [14] in the CCP4 crystallographic suite [15]. Native GrlR was used to obtain the phases. The model refitting and building of the lipid molecule were carried out using the O program [17] followed by refinement using the CNS program [16]. Finally, 264 welldefined water molecules were added, and refinement was continued until the R-value converged to 0.231 (Rfree = 0.278) for reflections I >  (I) to 2.5 Å resolution. The model had good stereochemistry, with all residues falling within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot (Table 1) analysed by the PROCHECK program [18].

without further purification and dialysed into 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5. All lipid samples were in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. Titrations were performed by injecting consecutive 5­10 l aliquots of lipid solution (0.9­1.0 mM) into the ITC cell containing GrlR or -lactoglobulin (0.015 mM) in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. The ITC data were corrected for the heat of dilution of the titrant by subtracting mixing enthalpies for injections of lipid solution into protein-free buffer. Two to four independent titration experiments were performed at 20 C to determine the binding constant of lipid to GrlR. ITC data analysis was performed using software developed in our laboratory and implemented in Origin 7.0 (OriginLab). Because both GrlR and -lactoglobulin are homodimeric, the protein dimer was employed as the functional unit. Either a general model based on the overall binding constants for two ligand-binding sites, or the model with two identical co-operative ligand-binding sites, was used in the data analysis.
Lipid extraction

ITC was performed using a VP-ITC apparatus (MicroCal). GrlR protein was purified using affinity chromatography and gel filtration in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The purified protein sample was analysed using MS to confirm that no lipid species were bound to it. Bovine -lactoglobulin (Sigma) was used

PBS-washed Ni-NTA precipitates were extracted with 600 l of ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). The contents of the tubes were vortex-mixed for 1 min and then transferred to a roller shaker at approx. 4 C for 1 h. Following incubation, 300 l of ice-cold chloroform was added and the contents were vortex-mixed for 30 s. The phase was broken by the addition of 200 l of ice-cold

water, and the lipids were extracted by vortexing for 2 min. The phases were separated by centrifugation at 8500 g for 5 min at 4 C. The lower organic phase was transferred to a fresh tube. To the remaining aqueous phase, 300 l of chloroform was added. The phases were vortex-mixed for 2 min and then separated by centrifugation at 21 000 g for 5 min at 4 C. The lower re-extracted organic phase was pooled with the initial organic phase, and the lipids were speed-vacuum-dried for 45 min. The dried lipids were stored at - 80 C until further analysis. Before analysis, the lipids were resuspended in 150 l of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v).
MS analysis

For general profiling, the lipids were initially separated on an XTerra® C18 reverse-phase column (1 mm diameter × 150 mm long) (Waters Corp.) before entering the mass spectrometer. Typically, 5 l of sample was injected for analysis. The inlet system consisted of a CapLC autosampler and a CapLC pump (Waters Corp.). Chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing 15 mM piperidine was used as the mobile phase for isocratic elution at a flow rate of 10 l/min. The column eluates were analysed using electrospray-ionization MS through a Micromass Q-TOF (quadrupole­time-of-flight) micro mass spectrometer (Waters Corp.) operated in the negative-ion mode. The capillary voltage and sample-cone voltage were maintained at 3.0 kV and 50 V respectively. The source temperature was 80 C and the nanoflow gas pressure was maintained at 70 kPa. The mass spectrum was acquired from m/z zero to 1200 in the negative-ion mode with an acquisition time of 25 min; the scan duration was 1.2 s. Individual molecular species were identified using tandem MS, and the collision energy used ranged from 25 to 80 eV. Quantification of individual lipid molecular species was performed using MRM (multiple reaction monitoring) with a 4000 Q TRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). Samples were introduced directly into the mass spectrometer using an HP 1100-Series HPLC-system autosampler (Agilent Technologies). Each individual ion dissociation pathway for the lipid species was optimized with regard to collision energy to minimize variations in relative ion abundance due to differences in rates of dissociation. An optimized 15 l of sample was injected per run per set, with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 200 l/min. The run was carried out for 2 min.
RESULTS GrlR has a lipocalin-like fold

is observed between GrlR and the lipid-binding domain of -lactoglobulin, a core lipocalin, yielding an RMSD (root mean square deviation) of 2.8 Å for 92 C atoms (PDB code 1BEB; 15 % sequence identity). This is followed by retinolbinding protein (PDB code 1AQB; RMSD = 3.3 Å for 98 C atoms; 12.6 % sequence identity). In addition, 23 lipocalinlike structures or lipid-binding proteins revealed significant structural homology with GrlR (see Supplementary Table S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/420/bj4200191add.htm). It is worth mentioning that a T3SS secretin pilot protein from Shigella flexneri that is bound with lipids also shows high structural similarity to GrlR [21] (RMSD = 2.8 Å for 77 C atoms; 16 % sequence identity; PDB code 1Y9T). All lipocalins have a hydrophobic cavity through which they bind to lipid molecules. For example, the folds of the lipocalins Blc (the first structurally known bacterial lipocalin) [10] and MxiM [21] are identical with each other and very similar to GrlR. These observations suggest that the -barrel architecture is an evolutionarily conserved structural feature for lipocalins and lipid-binding proteins, while at the same time, the amino-acid sequence of these proteins has diverged to acquire different lipid specificities for their functional roles (Figure 1B). On the basis of the size, hydrophobic nature of the -barrel cavity and structural similarity with other lipocalins, three lipid molecules that probably interact with GrlR were identified: (i) 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate; (ii) HHGP (1-hexanoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphate); and (iii) 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine. However, owing to the limited solubility of these lipids, only HHGP was suitable to conduct the ITC and structural studies. In order to demonstrate that the lipid-binding property of GrlR is similar to that of -lactoglobulin (a well-known lipocalin that is structurally homologous with GrlR), we studied the binding of HHGP to -lactoglobulin.
ITC studies

A search on the co-ordinates of GrlR (PDB accession code 2OVS) for structurally similar proteins was performed using the DALI server [19]. This search identified several lipocalins with significant structural similarity to the -barrel architecture of GrlR. Although lipocalins have poor or no sequence homology, they are very similar to each other structurally. The BLAST [20] (National Center for Biotechnology Information) search on the GrlR sequence revealed no significant sequence similarities with other lipocalins that are structurally similar to GrlR (Figure 1A). Lipocalins possess a structurally conserved C-terminal helix at one side of the eight-stranded -barrel. In GrlR, the final 11 residues of the C-terminus are not clearly visible in the electron-density map, and this region is presumably disordered. However, on the basis of the sequence analysis and modelling, it is likely that this region forms a two-turn helix. We speculate that the C-terminal region of GrlR is a flexible region with a minimum of a two-turn -helix. The highest structural similarity

Initially, ITC experiments were conducted for the three identified lipid molecules to determine the binding affinities. However, 1,2dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate and 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxysn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine are not completely soluble in Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5­8.5, at 20 C, and we were able to obtain interpretable data only for HHGP. The results indicated that HHGP exhibits a micromolar binding affinity for GrlR and for lactoglobulin, which is the closest lipocalin structural homologue of GrlR (Figure 2). Titrations of GrlR and -lactoglobulin with HHGP showed negative-power deflections, indicating an apparent exothermic reaction during the binding. GrlR is a dimer in solution as well as in crystal [1], and two ligand molecules were found to bind to one dimer of GrlR. Likewise, -lactoglobulin is a homodimeric protein. Therefore, the dimer was considered as the functional unit with two binding sites, and the concentration of protein was employed on a dimer basis (0.015 mM). The calorimetric titrations observed with HHGP binding to both proteins do not correspond to a system with identical binding sites, and non-identical and/or co-operative binding sites must be assumed. This is another piece of evidence for considering the dimer as the functional entity. Because the protein is a homodimer, with two identical binding sites in the absence of ligand, the two binding sites must exhibit (positive or negative) co-operativity. Experimental data were analysed using a general model based on the overall association constants,  i , and binding enthalpies, H i , associated with the formation of complex MLi [22], from which information on the types of binding sites may be inferred directly (see the Supplementary online material at http://www. BiochemJ.org/bj/420/bj4200191add.htm).

In the lower panels, the continuous line represents the best fit of the data using the general model using the overall binding constants for two binding sites, or the model with two identical binding sites with positive co-operativity (GrlR) or negative co-operativity (-lactoglobulin). -LG, -lactoglobulin.

The non-linear regression analysis indicated that two ligands bind to a GrlR dimer with  1 = (8.4 + 0.9) × 105 M-1 , - H 1 = - 0.1 + 0.4 kcal/mol (1 kcal = 4.184 kJ),  2 = (8.4 + - - H 2 = - 7.1 + 0.4 kcal/mol and n = 1.08 + 0.7) × 1011 M-1 , - - 0.06. The parameter n is not the stoichiometry, already accounted for in the model, but the fraction of active protein, as indicated in the Supplementary online material. The cooperativity parameter 4 2 / 1 2 is equal to 4.7, which indicates that the binding sites exhibit positive co-operativity. Furthermore, the experimental data were analysed by employing a positive co-operativity model with two identical binding sites, using explicitly the microscopic association constant, k, and binding enthalpy, H, for each binding site, and the co-operativity constant, , and the co-operativity enthalpy, h (see the Supplementary online material). The non-linear regression analysis indicated that two ligands are binding to a GrlR dimer with k = (4.2 + 0.4) × 105 M-1 , H = - 0.1 + 0.4 kcal/mol, - -  = 4.7 + 0.3, h = - 6.8 + 0.4 kcal/mol and n = 1.08 + 0.06. - - - These values are identical with the ones calculated directly from the parameters obtained with the general model, based on the overall parameters, using the appropriate linking equations between the two models (see the Supplementary online material). Once the microscopic equilibrium association constant and the binding enthalpy, as well as the co-operativity constant and enthalpy, are identified, the intrinsic binding entropy, S, and co-operativity entropy, s, may be calculated by applying standard relationships ( G = H-T S = -RTlnk, and g = h-T s = -RTln, where G is the Gibbs free energy, R is the ideal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature). The non-linear regression analysis also indicated that two ligand molecules bind to a -lactoglobulin dimer with  1 = (1.4 + - 0.3) × ;106 M-1 , H 1 = - 2.2 + 0.4 kcal/mol,  2 = (1.8 + 0.4) × - - 10 -1 10 M , H 2 = - 13.9 + 0.4 kcal/mol and n = 0.98 + 0.08. The - - co-operativity parameter 4 2 / 1 2 is equal to 0.038, which indicates that the binding sites are non-identical or that they exhibit negative co-operativity. -Lactoglobulin is homodimeric,

and hence the experimental data were analysed by employing a negative co-operativity model with two identical binding sites using explicitly k and H for each binding site, and  and h (see the Supplementary online material). The non-linear regression analysis indicated that two ligands are binding to a -lactoglobulin dimer with k = (7.2 + 0.9) × 105 M-1 , H = - + - 2.2 + 0.4 kcal/mol,  = 0.038 - 0.05, h = - 9.5 + 0.4 kcal/ - - mol and n = 0.98 + 0.08. - The ITC data suggest that each monomer of GrlR interacts with one molecule of HHGP. We speculate that lipids with two longer hydrocarbon tails may engage simultaneously with the dimeric GrlR, with one tail for each monomer. The highly hydrophobic nature of longer-chain lipids prevented us from performing further ITC experiments.
Structure of the GrlR­lipid complex

We attempted to co-crystallize each of the three lipid molecules with GrlR; however, diffraction-quality crystals were obtained only for HHGP with GrlR. In our previous work [1], the lipidbinding cavity of GrlR was occupied by a Triton X-100 molecule that was present in the lysis buffer. In the present study, during the co-crystallization of GrlR with HHGP, the protein was titrated with HHGP using ITC and the resulting complex was concentrated for setting up the crystallization screens. Moreover, no Triton X-100 was used during the lysis and purification stages. The structure of recombinant GrlR in complex with HHGP was solved by the molecular-replacement method using a synchrotron dataset and refined to a final R-value of 0.231 (Rfree = 0.278) at 2.5 Å resolution. There are two GrlR­lipid complex molecules in the asymmetric unit (Figure 3). The simulated annealing omit map (Figure 4) of the bound HHGP molecules shows a well-defined electron-density map. The model has been refined with good stereochemical parameters (Table 1). All the residues of GrlR, including the N-terminal linker, were well defined in the electrondensity map, except for the last ten residues at the C-terminus.

residues Tyr59 ­Asp70 . This indicates that transport through the hydrophobic cavity is restricted. Structural comparisons of GrlR with lipocalins revealed an extended loop (Loop 1, consisting of the plug region Tyr59 ­ Asp70 of GrlR) on one side of the -barrel, which is significantly longer than other loops (see Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/420/bj4200191add.htm). This loop may function as a plug to close and open the pore. Several highly conserved hydrophobic residues are located at the middle of this loop. The conformation and nature of this extended loop scaffold (plug region) is similar in all lipocalins. In retinol-binding proteins, this loop is shown to be partially responsible for the binding of lipid molecules [8]. In GrlR, the loop (Loop 3) that is located opposite to the extended loop has two conserved residues (Asp17 and Ser18 ; Supplementary Figure S1). Similar conserved residues are also observed in the corresponding structures in the outer-membrane enzyme PagP (PhoPQ-activated gene P) (Asp76 and Ser77 ) [23] and MxiM (Asp124 and Thr125 ). These two conserved residues have been reported to be important for the catalytic acyltransferase activity in PagP [23]. Moreover, MxiM has been proposed as a soluble acyltransferase that may function to lipidate components of the T3SS [21]. Similar to PagP, the loops of GrlR are flexible to accommodate the binding of lipid molecules. A small change in the / angle at both ends of the extended loop may facilitate the opening and closing of the pore, and thus regulate the movement of lipid molecules through the pore. Considering the high structural similarities of GrlR to PagP and MxiM, and the presence of conserved residues, we speculate that GrlR may also possess acyltransferase activity.

The GrlR molecule in the GrlR­HHGP complex is very similar to that of the GrlR structure determined previously [1]. GrlR is a single-domain -barrel protein. The -barrel consists of eight anti-parallel -strands running from one side of the molecule to the other. The inner-cavity region of the lipocalins is found to be highly hydrophobic and assumed to be a prerequisite for lipid binding. The diameter of the hydrophobic pore of GrlR is comparable with that of most of the well-known lipocalins (Figure 1B). In the GrlR­HHGP complex, there are 30 hydrophobic side chains that have extensive hydrophobic interactions with the bound lipid molecule. The ends of the barrel are closed off by the N-terminus (Met1 ­Lys4 ) and by plug

In order to establish a physiological role for the lipid-binding property and to identify the relevant lipid species, an MS experiment was carried out. His6 -tagged GrlR was over-expressed in bacterial cells, purified using Ni-NTA resins and used for lipid extraction. The extracted lipid was analysed by Q-TOF MS to obtain a complete lipid profile of the lipid species that co-purified with GrlR. A representative lipid profile for the GrlRbound species is shown in Figure 5(B). The total-cell-lipid extract was used as the control (Figure 5A). In order to discriminate between specific and non-specific binding, a reference protein, PrmB (L3 ribosomal-protein glutamine methyltransferase), which is not reported to bind to any lipids, was also included in the analysis. His6 -tagged PrmB was over-expressed and purified using Ni-NTA. The lipids were extracted from PrmB by a method similar to that used for GrlR. The lipid profile generated from PrmB is shown in Figure 5(C). Comparison between the GrlR and the PrmB lipid profiles showed drastic differences. Species with m/z ratios of 688, 714, 716, 719, 742, 745, 747 and 773 were observed to be significantly more abundant in the GrlR extracts compared with the PrmB extract. These species were observed to be absent in the Ni-NTA lipid extracts from the un-induced bacterial cultures (results not shown). Identification of the species was carried out using tandem MS. PG (phosphatidylglycerol) and PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) species with fatty-acid chains of C16:0 , C16:1 or C18:1 were identified to be bound to the protein (Figure 6). Interestingly, only specific types of lipid species appear to be protein-bound. An MRM-based approach was used to quantify these lipid species in the extracts. In these experiments, the first quadrupole, Q1, was set to pass the precursor lipid ion of interest to the collision cell, Q2, where the lipid ion underwent collision-induced dissociation. The third quadrupole, Q3, was set to pass the

structure-specific product ion characteristic of the precursor lipid of interest. MRM is very sensitive and is able to quantify the lipid species with reduced interference from other lipid species that could also have the same m/z ratio. The MRM method was assembled for the identified lipids and the extracts were used for quantification. As expected, the levels of the identified lipids were observed to be significantly higher in the GrlR extracts compared with the uninduced control and the PrmB extracts (Figure 7). The data obtained from the Q-TOF analysis were confirmed with the MRM data, which also showed that PG and PE species with fatty-acid chains of C16:0 , C16:1 or C18:1 were bound to GrlR.

DISCUSSION

Structural analysis of GrlR showed that its fold is very similar to those of lipocalins or lipid-binding proteins. On the basis of the cavity size and analysis of homologous structures, we predicted that LPA can bind to the cavity; consequently, HHGP, which is a

member of the LPA family, was chosen for the present study. We have co-crystallized the GrlR­HHGP complex and determined its structure. The crystal structure of GrlR with bound lipid ligand showed a dimeric arrangement, with a lipid molecule bound to each monomer of the protein. Furthermore, we have performed ITC studies and identified the parameters for the binding of HHGP to GrlR. In addition, the binding of HHGP to -lactoglobulin has been studied and compared with binding to GrlR. Although GrlR and -lactoglobulin bind to HHGP, according to the data analysis of the ITC experiments the two binding sites in GrlR and -lactoglobulin dimers show positive and negative cooperativity respectively. The co-operativity parameter value of 4.7 for GrlR (see above) corresponds to a co-operativity Gibbs free energy change, G, of - 0.9 kcal/mol, whereas the co-operativity parameter value of 0.038 for -lactoglobulin corresponds to a G of +1.9 cal/mol. The estimated values of the Hill coefficient for GrlR and -lactoglobulin are 1.37 and 0.33 respectively, as compared with a value of 1 for independent ligand binding. The intrinsic binding of HHGP to GrlR and lactoglobulin is characterized by similar moderate affinities [k = (4.2 + 0.4) × 105 M-1 , kd = 2.4 M for GrlR; - k = (7.2 + 0.4) × 105 M-1 , kd = 1.4 M for -lactoglobulin] - with a Gibbs energy of binding of - 7.5 kcal/mol and - 7.9 kcal/mol respectively, and it is entropically driven ( H = - 0.1 + 0.4 kcal/mol, -T S = - 7.4 + 0.4 kcal/mol for - - GrlR; H = - 2.2 + 0.4 kcal/mol, -T S = - 5.7 + 0.4 kcal/mol - - for -lactoglobulin). Therefore the intrinsic parameters for the binding of HHGP to GrlR and -lactoglobulin are similar (micromolar binding affinity, small binding enthalpy and binding dominated by entropy) and correspond to the expected parameters for the binding of an apolar molecule: hydrophobic desolvation as the predominant phenomenon, resulting in a remarkable entropy gain and a small enthalpic contribution. The binding of physiological lipid species with GrlR is further confirmed using MS studies that compared the profiles from uninduced with induced bacterial cultures. We also identified PG and PE as the two main lipid species that bound to GrlR. It is well known that PE and PG are the major lipid components of bacterial membranes. The inner membrane of Escherichia coli contains 70­ 80 % PE and 20­25 % PG [24]. PGs and phosphatidic acids differ

HHGP is similar to that of the GrlR­HHGP complex. HHGP showed micromolar binding affinity with both GrlR and MxiM [21]. Future studies will be directed towards understanding the relationship, if any, between the regulatory and lipid-binding function of GrlR. We speculate that GrlR might have multiple functions as a regulatory protein as well as a lipidbinding/transport protein, and that these functions may change depending on the physiological condition of the bacteria. In this context, it is worth mentioning here that the bacterial outer membrane enzyme PagP was shown to transfer a palmitate chain from a phospholipid to lipid A [23]. PagP is a close structural homologue of GrlR, suggesting that GrlR has the potential to carry lipid molecules.

to some extent in terms of their chemical entities. The addition of a glycerol group to phosphatidic acid results in PG. HHGP, which showed a micromolar binding affinity to GrlR in the ITC experiment, has a phosphatidic-acid head group. Previous studies showed that a major urinary protein of mouse (PDB code 1MUP) [25,26] binds to a number of odorant molecules with varying affinity. A similar multiple binding was also reported in odorantbinding protein [27]. Using MS experiments, we have identified the binding of two different lipid species to GrlR. Furthermore, our ITC experiments with HHGP and -lactoglobulin demonstrate that HHGP binds to -lactoglobulin. -Lactoglobulin is a well-studied lipocalin, and its crystal structures have been reported in complex with palmitic acid (PDB code 1B0O [28]), 12-bromododecanoic acid (PDB code 1BSO [29]) and retinol (PDB code 1GX8 [30]). The structures of the -lactoglobulin­lipid complexes compare well with that of GrlR­HHGP. Moreover, the binding of HHGP with other known lipocalins such as Blc [10] and MxiM [21] was reported previously. In addition, the co-crystal structure of MxiM with

The formalism of binding polynomials is the appropriate methodology for analysing systems with more than one ligand-binding site [1]. The binding polynomial for a macromolecule with two ligand-binding sites is a second-order polynomial in the freeligand concentration, and it is calculated considering the different species present [macromolecule with no ligand (M), with one ligand bound (ML) and with two ligands bound (ML2 )] (eqn 1): P= [M] [ML] [ML2 ] + + = 1 + 1 [L] + 2 [L]2 [M] [M] [M] (1)

where the microscopic association constant for each of the binding sites, k, and the co-operativity constant, , have been introduced (eqn 5): k= [ML] [M][L] [ML2 ] k = [ML][L]

(5)

Then, nLB and (eqn 6): n LB =

H are calculated from the binding polynomial

In eqn (1), the overall association constant,  i , was introduced (eqn 2): [MLi ] i = [M][L]i (2)

2k[L] + 2k 2 [L]2 1 + 2k[L] + k 2 [L]2 2k H + k 2 [L]2 (2 H + H = 1 + 2k[L] + k 2 [L]2

h)

(6)

The average number of ligand molecules bound per macromolecule, nLB , and the average excess molar enthalpy, H , are calculated from the binding polynomial (eqn 3): n LB = [L]B lnP 1 [L] + 2 2 [L]2 = = [M]T ln[L] 1 + 1 [L] + 2 [L]2 lnP 1 H1 + 2 [L]2 H2 H = RT 2 = T 1 + 1 [L] + 2 [L]2

where H is the enthalpy associated with the intrinsic ligand binding to each binding site, and h is the co-operativity enthalpy. Comparison of eqn (3) and eqn (6) provides the link between the two previous models (eqn 7): 1 = 2k 2 = k 2  H1 = H H2 = 2 H +

(7) h

(3)

where [L]B is the concentration of ligand bound to the macromolecule, [M]T is the total concentration of macromolecule, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and H i is the overall enthalpy change associated with the formation of complex MLi . A dimensionless parameter can be constructed with the two overall association constants, and several possible cases can be distinguished based on the value of this parameter [2]: (i) if 4 2 / 1 2 is equal to 1, the binding sites are identical and independent; (ii) if 4 2 / 1 2 is less than 1, the binding sites are nonidentical and independent, or they exhibit negative co-operativity; (iii) if 4 2 / 1 2 is greater than 1, the binding sites exhibit positive co-operativity. The binding polynomial for a macromolecule with two identical co-operative binding sites may be written as eqn (4): P= [M] [ML] [ML2 ] + + = 1 + 2k[L] + k 2 [L]2 [M] [M] [M] (4)

and once the set of parameters for one model is known, the parameters for the other model can be calculated readily. In general, it is recommended that the initial analysis is performed with the general model using the overall association constants and binding enthalpies. Then, a specific model (identical or nonidentical, and independent or co-operative binding sites) can be selected via the estimated values of the association constants (in particular, the value of 4 2 / 1 2 ) [1]. The parameter 4 2 / 1 2 is equal to the co-operative interaction constant . The total concentration of ligand and macromolecule in the calorimetric cell after the injection, j, are given by eqn (8): [L]T,j = [L]0 1 - 1 - [M]T,j = [M]0 1 - v V

injection j, qj , is proportional to the change in the concentration of each macromolecule­ligand complex between injection j and j - 1 and the enthalpy change associated with the complex formation [3] (eqn 9): qj = V + =V v V v H2 [ML2 ] j - [ML2 ]j-1 1 - V v H [ML]j - [ML]j-1 1 - V H1 [ML]j - [ML]j-1 1 - h

Once the previous equation has been solved for the free-ligand concentration, the concentration of each complex, at each titration point, can be calculated with either model (eqn 11): [ML] = [M]T 1 [L] 2k[L] = [M]T 1 + 1 [L] + 2 [L]2 1 + 2k[L] + k 2 [L]2 2 [L]2 k 2 [L]2 = [M]T 2 1 + 1 [L] + 2 [L] 1 + 2k[L] + k 2 [L]2 (11)

where qd is an adjustable constant taking into account a nonzero dilution heat (heat effect due to unspecific phenomena, such as dilution of ligand, injection turbulence, etc.). The values of the equilibrium constants and the binding enthalpies are obtained through non-linear least squares regression analysis of the experimental binding data (qj ). In order to use eqn (9), the concentration of the different complexes, MLi , must be calculated solving the following conservation equation (eqn 10): lnP [L]T = [L] + [M]T ln[L] (10)

It is usual to introduce a factor n accompanying the total concentration of protein, and accounting for errors in proteinconcentration determination and/or protein active fraction lower than 100%. This parameter appears to multiply the concentration of protein in eqns (10) and (11), or alternatively in eqn (8). This parameter does not represent the stoichiometry, since the stoichiometry is considered explicitly in the model.
