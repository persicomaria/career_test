Ribose-5-phosphate isomerases (EC 5.3.1.6) inter-convert ribose-5-phosphate and ribulose-5-phosphate. This reaction allows the synthesis of ribose from other sugars, as well a means for salvage of carbohydrates after nucleotide breakdown. Two unrelated types of enzyme are known to catalyze the isomerization. The most common one, RpiA, is present in almost all organisms. The second type, RpiB, is found in many bacterial species. Here, we demonstrate that the RpiB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Rv2465c) has catalytic properties very similar to those previously reported for the Escherichia coli RpiB enzyme. Further, we report the structure of the mycobacterial enzyme, solved by molecular replacement and ° refined to 1.88 A resolution. Comparison with the E. coli structure shows that there are important differences in the two active sites, including a change in the position and nature of the catalytic base. Sequence comparisons reveal that the M. tuberculosis and E. coli RpiB enzymes are in fact representative of two distinct sub-families. The mycobacterial enzyme represents a type found only in actinobacteria, while the enzyme from E. coli is typical of that seen in many other bacterial proteomes. Both RpiBs are very different from RpiA in structure as well as in the construction of the active site. Docking studies allow additional insights into the reactions of all three enzymes, and show that many features of the mechanism are preserved despite the different catalytic components.

Introduction
The World Health Organization reports that two million people are dying each year from tuberculosis, and one-third of the world's population is infected with the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After a long period during which the number of new cases of tuberculosis declined, a recent increase has been accompanied by the emerAbbreviations used: Mt RpiB, RpiB from M. tuberculosis; Ec RpiB, RpiB from E. coli; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s., root-mean-square.

gence of antibiotic-resistant strains. These grim facts provide urgent motivation for studies of the basic biology of this poorly understood organism. Many of its metabolic processes have not yet been described, and even pathways that are common to other organisms frequently have aspects that are peculiar to M. tuberculosis. Such is the case for ribose metabolism. Ribose, particularly in the form of ribose-5-phosphate, is essential to the synthesis of nucleotides and a number of important cofactors such as ATP and NAD. The sugar may be obtained exogenously, through recycling of nucleic acids, or by de novo synthesis from other sugars. The ribose-5phosphate isomerase that catalyzes the interconversion of ribose-5-phosphate and ribulose-5phosphate (Figure 1) is a central component of both anabolic and catabolic processes. In most

Figure 1. Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase reaction. The expected catalytic acid and base are shown together with the substrates, products and intermediates; carbon atoms of the sugars are numbered. With ribose-5-phosphate as substrate, acid ­ base catalysis opens the 5-membered furanose ring to give the open-chain aldose necessary for further reaction. A basic group of the enzyme must then extract a proton from C2 of the aldose, generating a cis-1,2-enediol(ate) intermediate, and then release the same proton at C1. An acid ­base group located on the opposite site of the active site transfers a proton from O2 to O1, to produce the ketose sugar.

organisms, including humans and Escherichia coli,1 the pertinent enzyme is the constitutively expressed RpiA (EC 5.3.1.6). In E. coli, a second enzyme, RpiB, bears the same EC number, and can carry out the same reaction, although it is completely unrelated to RpiA.2,3 Expression of either enzyme allows survival, but a double mutation of the E. coli isomerase genes (rpiA2rpiB2) caused severely impaired growth under any conditions, demonstrating that the reaction itself is important.4 While RpiA enzymes are widespread, RpiB-like enzymes are almost exclusively restricted to bacteria, with a limited number of examples now emerging in protozoa. Inspection of 80 completed genomes showed that all carry at least one of these enzymes. The genome of M. tuberculosis does not include an RpiA sequence. However, comparisons indicated that the only sequence similar to RpiB (annotated as Rv2465c in the genome,5 and described as a "probable isomerase") would lack key residues in the active site of E. coli RpiB.6 Furthermore, the ability of the Rv2465c protein to carry out the ribose-5-phosphate isomerase reaction had not been tested, leaving open the possibility that a third type of isomerase might exist. The structures of the E. coli isomerases, Ec RpiA7,8 and Ec RpiB6 have been described previously. Here, we report the structure of the mycobacterial enzyme, Mt RpiB, and show that it is fully competent in ribose-5-phosphate isomerization. Substitutions in active-site residues allow this enzyme to catalyze isomerization in a manner similar, but not identical, to that used by Ec RpiB, and very different from that used by RpiAs. Docking studies allow additional insights into the catalytic elements of all three enzymes.

protein for both structural work and kinetic analysis. Enzymatic activity was tested using a spectrophotometric assay that directly monitors the conversion of ribose-5-phosphate to ribulose-5phosphate. Mt RpiB has a Km of 3.7 mM and a kcat of 120 s21 for the ribose-5-phosphate substrate at 37 8C. Fructose-6-phosphate, D -erythrose, D -4erythronic acid and D -3-phosphoglyceric acid were thought to be potential inhibitors due to their similarities to the substrates, but kinetic analysis showed that these substances had no measurable effect on the reaction rate of Mt RpiB at concentrations up to 10 mM. Phosphate was a weak inhibitor (Ki 130 mM). Treatment of the enzyme with iodoacetate, however, completely inhibited its activity. Overall structure The structure of RpiB (162 residues, Mr 17.3 kDa per protein chain) was solved by molecular replacement using Ec RpiB6 as a search model (32% amino acid sequence identity), and refined at ° 1.88 A resolution. Statistics for the X-ray data and the final refined structure are summarized in Table 1. Five molecules are present in the asymmetric unit, all of which begin at residues 2­ 3 and end at residues 158 ­160. Residues at the extreme N terminus including the 6-His-tag (MAHHHHHHSG) cannot be seen in the electron density maps. The electron density shown in Figure 2 illustrates the phosphate that is bound at the same position in each of the protein molecules. Four of the molecules in the asymmetric unit are arranged to form two dimers (Figure 3(A)); the fifth forms an additional dimer via a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis. The subunit structure is based on a Rossmann fold (Figure 3(B)). Five parallel b-sheets are flanked by two a-helices on one side and three on the other. The sixth helix protrudes from the main fold; together with the loop that follows it, a6 embraces the sister monomer and thus acts to stabilize the dimer. The five molecules are very similar, with pairwise ° r.m.s. differences of 0.10­ 0.27 A when the Ca

atoms of the B, C, D and E subunits are compared. The A molecule is slightly different, with r.m.s. ° differences of 0.52 ­0.59 A when compared to the other four. These larger values reflect minor differences at the N terminus, and in the b2/a2, a2/b3 and a4/b5 loops. The dimers are also very similar, ° with r.m.s. differences of , 0.4 A when all Cas are compared. Five segments of each molecule are involved in the dimer interface: residues 11 ­ 12 (at the end of b1), 44 ­55 (b2 ­ a2 loop and a2), 71­ 103 (a3, b4, a4 and connecting loops), 114 ­115 (b5/a5 loop) and 140 ­158 (a6 and the following loop). The ° interaction buries 1990 A3 of surface area per subunit, at the high end of the range observed for ° homodimers (1700(^ 1100) A2)9 and accounting for 24% of the accessible surface of each subunit. The interacting surfaces show excellent complementarity, with a gap volume index of 1.1, at the very lowest end of the range observed for homodimers (2.2(^ 0.9)).9 Nearly 70% of the atoms providing the dimer contacts are non-polar, again consistent with observations for other oligomeric interactions. The polar residues of each subunit supply 18 direct hydrogen bonds; no bridging water molecules are present. Formation of the Mt RpiB dimer in solution is supported by results from several biochemical experiments. The protein migrated through a native polyacrylamide gel with a mobility suggesting a size of 34 kDa. Gel filtration chromatography is consistent with a molecular mass in the range of 30 ­35 kDa, and dynamic light scattering indicated a molecular mass of the primary species of 32 kDa, with some higher-order aggregates also present (apparently as tetramers). Comparison to the overall structure of Ec RpiB The only other structure available from pfam02502 (the RpiB/LacAB family10) is that of Ec RpiB.6 ° Using a cut-off of 2.0 A in the comparison, the A subunits of the two structures have an r.m.s. differ° ence of 0.8 A with 132 Ca atoms aligned. Ec RpiB appears in the crystal as a dimer of dimers; each of these dimers is very similar to that observed for Mt RpiB. When the AD dimer of Ec RpiB is compared to the AB dimer of Mt RpiB using the same cut-off, 260 Ca atoms match with an r.m.s. differ° ence of 1.0 A. The contact surface in the E. coli ° dimer (1470 A2 buried per subunit) is somewhat smaller than the equivalent surface in Mt RpiB. In the M. tuberculosis enzyme there are few interactions that would stabilize an Ec RpiB-like tetramer. Comparison to other known structures Other structural relatives were sought using the DALI server.11 The Protein Data Bank (PDB12) was first searched using the Mt RpiB subunit as a probe. The best hits (other than Ec RpiB) had Z-scores of 6.3, with , 100 residues matching with

° r.m.s. distances of , 3 A. The similar proteins included type 1 periplasmic binding proteins, as well as structurally related enzymes and DNAbinding proteins. These results confirm the similarities to proteins with a Rossmann fold, but since there were no proteins with analogous function among the hits, they provided no new insights into Mt RpiB action. DALI did not find any additional matches when the dimer was used as a probe, suggesting that the subunit arrangement is unique to the RpiB family. Active site and reaction mechanism No effective inhibitors have yet been identified for any member of the RpiB family. Phosphate, shown here to be a weak inhibitor (Ki 130 mM), was present at high concentrations in the crystallization solution, and observed to bind between the two subunits of the dimer in all five molecules of the asymmetric unit. As is typical for proteins with this type of a/b fold,13 the binding site is located at the C-terminal end of the central b-sheet. Direct hydrogen bonds are contributed to the phosphate by the side-chains of His12 from one subunit, and Arg137 and Arg141 from the other (Figures 2 and 4(A)). Arg113 also interacts with the phosphate in the B and D molecules but its side-chain is oriented differently in the other three cases. The active site of Ec RpiB was identified previously using a combination of sequence conservation and structural arguments.6 The position occupied by the phosphate inhibitor in Mt RpiB agrees well with that predicted for phospho-sugars in the E. coli enzyme, suggesting that substrate will bind in a very similar manner in the two enzymes. The placement of the active site allows the substrate to interact with a number of residues from both subunits. The phosphate-binding residues of Mt RpiB are conserved in Ec RpiB, and Arg40 (replaced by Asp43 in the mycobacterial sequence) offers additional possible interactions with the phosphate oxygen atoms. However, other residues lining the two active-site cavities are not completely conserved (Figures 3 and 4). The most interesting change is the replacement of the proposed catalytic base of Ec RpiB (Cys66) by a different residue (Glu75) found elsewhere in the sequence. The side-chains of the two amino acids assume the same position in the active site (Figures 4 and 5). Other RpiB sequences were identified using BLAST;14 the alignment of some of these is shown in Figure 6. Only seven proteins are currently seen to cluster with Mt RpiB, and to possess the same active-site residues, including the residue equivalent to Glu75. Most other RpiB sequences are more similar to Ec RpiB; the active-site cysteine is absolutely conserved within that sub-family. Further, the residues important for the dimer interface also show distinct patterns for each type of RpiB. The sequence comparisons suggest that the larger

dimer interface of Mt RpiB will be a common property within its sub-family. In most cases, the segment involved is simply extended, however, the last loop of the Mt RpiB structure is longer, providing additional interacting residues at the C-terminal end. Modeling of small molecule binding As no substrate or similar inhibitor complex presently exists for either type of RpiB, docking studies were undertaken as an aid in the interpretation of the structures. The programs used allow flexibility in the ligand, but not the protein. All of the relevant substrates, i.e. ribose-5-phosphate in open and furanose forms (a and b-anomers) as well as ribulose-5-phosphate, were docked into both Mt RpiB and Ec RpiB. The ten top-scoring binding modes for each ligand were inspected visually; their close agreement suggested that in all cases a single most probable mode had been identified. The similarities observed are indeed rather remarkable given the relatively low level of sequence identity (32%), and the differences in the active-site structure. The phosphate head of each sugar consistently docks where the phosphate is bound in the Mt RpiB structures, coordinated by His12, Arg113, Arg137, His138 and Arg141 (Mt RpiB numbering). Binding of b-ribose-5-phosphate is illustrated in Figure 6(A) and (B). Either anomer of the furanose sugar can apparently be accommodated via slight differences in their interactions with Asn103 (an absolutely conserved residue in both sub-families). O2 is found close to Glu75 (or Cys66 in E. coli), while O3 is well situated to form a hydrogen bond with the conserved Asp11. The ring oxygen atoms (O4) of the furanose sugars are always placed adjacent

to His102 (again, a fully conserved residue), suggesting that this histidine could catalyze ring opening by donating a proton to the sugar. Once the ring is opened, the linear form of ribose-5-phosphate retains its phosphoryl group in the same binding environment. In both enzymes, O3 is now placed near His102, and O4 near Asp11, essentially a switch of their functions with the furanose sugar. C1 and C2, which are the focus of the isomerization, are now placed near Glu75 (Cys66 in Ec RpiB), the putative catalytic base. O1 makes hydrogen bonds to the sidechain of Asn103 as well as the main-chain amide nitrogen of Gly74. O2 also has potential interactions with Ser71 (Thr68 in E. coli), as well as backbone nitrogen atoms of residues 70 ­ 72 (in the b3/a3 loop). The interactions of docked ribulose-5-phosphate are almost identical to those of the linear ribose phosphate. Both for comparison, and because the available structure of an inhibitor complex allowed some validation of the method, the same procedure was applied to E. coli RpiA. In Figure 6(C), the excellent agreement of the predicted mode of binding to that actually observed for the inhibitor arabinose-5phosphate6 is illustrated. The phosphate group makes a number of interactions with main-chain and side-chain groups. O1 interacts with the sidechains of Asp81 and Lys94. O2 interacts with Lys94, Glu103 and the backbone nitrogen of residue 95. O3 interacts with Asp84 and 97-N, and O4 with the main-chain oxygen of residue 28. In Figure 6(D), the predicted mode of binding of the substrate ribose-5-phosphate is shown. The sugar docks in a very similar way for both anomers of the furanose sugar. The phosphate group of the substrate is predicted to make interactions essentially identical to those found in the complex structure. However, to our surprise, the plane with the sugar ring is flipped

almost 1808 to make a distinct set of interactions with the protein. O1 now interacts with Asp84 and backbone nitrogen atoms near residue 96. O2 hydrogen bonds to Lys94 and Glu103, while O3 interacts with Asp81. O4 is placed near Asp84 in a manner suggesting that this residue could protonate it, and so catalyze ring opening. Once the ring is opened, C1 and C2 lie near the proposed catalytic base, Glu103. O1 and O2 have a number of hydrogenbonding options centering on the main-chain in the

95­97 loop. As for the RpiBs, the interactions of docked ribulose-5-phosphate are predicted to be almost identical to those of the linear form of ribose-5-phosphate.

ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. The kinetic constants measured for Mt RpiB (Km 3.7 mM and kcat 120 s21 for the ribose-5-phosphate substrate) are very similar to those obtained for Ec RpiB6 (Km 1.23 mM and kcat 69 s21). Both enzymes are significantly slower than RpiA8 although they bind substrate equally well (for RpiA, Km 3.1 mM, kcat 2100 s21). The slow action of Ec RpiB is unlikely to be a problem for E. coli since this organism does not generally depend on RpiB for its survival, relying instead on the activity of the constitutively expressed RpiA. Synthesis of Ec RpiB is induced only in the presence of ribose, or the extremely rare sugar allose. Since the M. tuberculosis genome lacks a sequence for RpiA, it is reasonable to assume that the ribose-5-phosphate isomerase reaction is Mt RpiB's main biological function. The apparent lack of any cognate repressor in the mycobacterium further suggests that the enzyme

will be constitutively expressed. Since M. tuberculosis's growth rate is very slow (doubling time . 24 hours), the slow rate of the isomerase reaction is unlikely to be a problem. The similarity of the catalytic constants for the two RpiBs is particularly interesting in the context of a change in the putative catalytic base. In E. coli, the base is Cys66, while in M. tuberculosis the relevant residue is Glu75 (Figures 3 and 4). While the two residues originate from opposite ends of the b3/a3 loop, their side-chains terminate at precisely the same location within the active site and so allow a very similar role in the reaction. Ec RpiB is inhibited completely by iodoacetate,1 as is Mt RpiB (shown here), but presumably for different reasons. In Ec RpiB, direct modification of Cys66 seems the most likely explanation, while for Mt RpiB, reaction of the reagent with any of the histidine residues in the active site would provide

806

° 1.88 A Structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis RpiB

a similar effect. The furanose forms of ribose-5phosphate are more abundant in solution (64% for the b and 36% for the a-furanoses, as compared to 0.1% for the linear aldehyde15), and so it would be advantageous for the enzyme to act first upon them. Docking studies (Figure 6(A) and (B)) indicate that both enzymes are well suited to the binding of a furanose form. Each possesses a histidine residue ideally placed to act as an acid catalyst in opening the ring, to provide the linear form of the sugar that is the actual subject of the isomerization (Figure 1). Once the ring is opened, the catalytic base lies close to C1 and C2, allowing transfer of a proton from one to the other. Each ribose-5-phosphate isomerase further needs a way to stabilize the negatively charged intermediate of the reaction (the ene-diol(ate) of Figure 1). Calculations have suggested that this is in general the most important factor in catalysis for this class of enzyme reaction.16 The RpiBs have a number of main-chain nitrogen atoms, as well as an absolutely conserved serine or threonine residue, in the appropriate position for such a function. Sequence comparisons (Figure 5) show that Mt RpiB and Ec RpiB are in fact representative of two distinct RpiB sub-families, and that the activesite residues are completely conserved within each sub-family. The Mt RpiB grouping presently contains eight enzymes, all from organisms in the actinobacterial phylum. All other RpiBs are more closely related to Ec RpiB. The motif encompassing residues 69 ­75 of the Mt RpiB sequence (GGSGNGE) provides the most distinctive signature, being replaced with CGT(S)GhGh in Ec RpiBlike sequences. A glycine at residue 69 of Mt RpiB is necessary to allow proper placement of Glu75. The side-chain of Cys66 in E. coli is smaller than a glutamate, and a hydrophobic residue at the position of Mt RpiB's Glu75 instead allows packing within the hydrophobic core. A glycine at position 70 (Mt RpiB numbering) is necessary in both subfamilies to allow room for the substrate, and a glycine at position 72 is needed for the proper backbone conformation. The hydroxyl group at position 71 allows hydrogen bonding to substrates and intermediates. Asn73 of Mt RpiB makes hydrogen bonds to both polar backbone atoms of residue 89; the equivalent residue of Ec RpiB-like sequences makes hydrophobic interactions in the protein core. The Gly-Ala sequence at residues 36 ­37 of Mt RpiB exhibits an unusual non-proline cis peptide bond in both proteins. This interaction allows hydrogen bonds between 36-O and 10-N, as well as 37-N and 10-O, and a stacking interaction with Phe49. This glycine, and presumably the cis-peptide, is conserved in both sub-families (e.g. as Gly34His35 in Ec RpiB). The completely unrelated enzyme RpiA carries out the same reaction, yet in a different fashion, and so it is not surprising that the two types of Rpi show distinct patterns of inhibition. For example, D -4-erythronic acid, D -3-phosphoglyceric acid and arabinose-5-phosphate are useful inhibi-

tors of RpiA, with Kis in the millimolar range,8,17 yet they had no appreciable effect on Mt RpiB. The docking studies described here offer new insights into the mechanism of RpiA. Most intriguing, the docking mode of arabinose-5-phosphate is predicted to be different from that of the substrate ribose-5-phosphate, from which it differs only by the configuration at C2. The mode of binding to the inhibitor is firmly supported by the electron density (see Figure 6(B) of Zhang et al.8), and faithfully reproduced in the docking experiments. The predicted mode of binding to the furanose substrate however places O4 adjacent to Asp84, a residue shown by mutagenesis studies to be important in function,18 yet whose role was earlier unclear. Thus, like the RpiBs, acid catalysis by the enzyme can aid in opening the ring of the substrate. Kinetics data indicate that the furanose is indeed the first species bound by RpiA.18 Other similarities link the three enzymes. In RpiA, like Ec RpiB, a glutamic acid is the catalytic base in the isomerization. In all of the enzymes, stabilization of the ene-diolate intermediate involves hydrogen bonding to backbone nitrogen atoms. The additional contributions of Lys94 of RpiA may explain why RpiA is substantially faster than either of the RpiBs; the positive charge would presumably help stabilize the negatively charged intermediate, and so promote catalysis. As seems to be the case for the RpiBs, O3 in the open species also lies near the residue predicted to catalyze ring opening at O4 in the furanose ring. Thus the parallels between the different enzymes are strong, despite the differences in their active sites. The reasons for the variety of ribose-5-phosphate isomerase enzymes are not yet clear. Most organisms from all kingdoms and phyla appear to contain only RpiA, with RpiBs being found almost exclusively in bacteria. The few eukaryotic examples of RpiB most closely resemble the E. coli enzyme. In our survey of 80 completed bacterial genomes, we categorized organisms as to whether they possess RpiA, RpiB or both. All eukaryotes, and most bacteria, have only RpiA. Approximately one-third of the bacterial genomes have only RpiB, while others (about one-sixth, including E. coli) possess both RpiA and RpiB. Ec RpiB-like enzymes account for the vast majority of the RpiBs identified, and all of the cases where the organism has both RpiA and RpiB. Mt RpiB-like enzymes are at present found only in actinobacteria, and then only when RpiA is absent. Bifidobacterium longum is the only actinobacterium currently known to have the opposite pattern, i.e. it has RpiA, but not RpiB. It may be significant that this organism belongs to the order Bifidobacteriales, rather than the Actinomycetales to which the known Mt RpiBs belong. Two of the ten actinobacterial genomes, those of Streptomyces avermitilis and Streptomyces coelicolor, in fact include two RpiB enzymes, one that resembles MtRpiB, and a second that is more similar to Ec RpiB. The Mt RpiB DNA sequence exhibits the high

G þ C content (68%) that is characteristic of the actinobacterial phylum (e.g. 66% for M. tuberculosis). In contrast, the base composition of the gene for Ec RpiB (G þ C 51%) is more typical of the E. coli genome (, 51%). Thus the two enzymes must have diverged early, and evolved with their respective genomes. Actinobacteria are largely aerobic, soil-living organisms, and many live in demanding environmental niches; it seems likely that the Mt RpiB type of enzyme offers some selective advantage under these conditions.

graphy column (Hiloade 16/60 Superdexe 75, Pharmacia Biotech) using a buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Mes (pH 6), 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM b-ME, 10% glycerol, and by dynamic light scattering using a DynaPro-MS/X (Proterion Corporation) instrument. Assays The activity of Mt RpiB was measured using a spectrophotometric assay19 that monitors formation of the ketose ribulose-5-phosphate via its absorption of UV light at 290 nm. Reaction mixtures contained 46 nM enzyme in a buffer of 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8), and were followed at 37 8C for ten minutes. Kinetic constants were obtained from Hanes­ Woolf plots. Potential inhibitors were evaluated by monitoring changes in the reaction rate with 5 mM ribose-5-phosphate. Iodoacetate (10 mM, incubated for ten minutes prior to the assay), fructose-6-phosphate (10 mM), D -erythrose (10 mM), D -3-phosphoglyceric acid (10 mM) and D-4-erythronic acid (10 and 100 mM) were tested. D -4-Erythronic acid is only stable at pH , 6, and so a buffer of 50 mM malonic acid (pH 6), was used instead of the Tris buffer used in other tests. Sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), was tested at concentrations between 10 and 450 mM to determine the IC50, which was converted to Ki using the catalytic constants measured for this batch at room temperature (Km 2.5 mM, kcat 100 s21), and assuming that Kd , Km : Crystallization, data collection, and processing The protein was crystallized by vapour diffusion in sitting drops of 0.5 ml protein and 0.5 ml reservoir solution, 1.26 M NaKPO4 (pH 7.5), at 20 8C. Needle-like crystals (0.1 ­0.2 mm £ 0.05 mm £ 0.05 mm) appeared after ,one week. Crystals were transferred briefly to a cryoprotectant of 10% glycerol, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol and 80% reservoir solution before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected at 110 K (Oxford Cryosystems) at beamline I711 MAX-Laboratory, Lund, Sweden using a Mar research imaging plate detector system. Diffraction data were indexed using MOSFLM20 and processed with SCALA21 (as implemented in the CCP4 program suite22). Statistics are summarized in Table 1. The crystals possessed the symmetry of the space group C2; and the Matthew's coefficient23 suggested that four to six molecules were present in the asymmetric unit. Structure determination and refinement The structure was solved by molecular replacement in AMoRe24 as implemented in the CCP4 interface, using the functional dimer of E. coli RpiB6 as search model. After refined fitting of the top two dimer solutions, a correlation coefficient of 26% was attained, with an R-factor of 50%. Inspection using the graphics program O25 indicated that these solutions were consistent with good crystal packing. ARP/wARP26 (100 cycles) using the ° complete 1.9 A data set reduced the R-factor to 34%. Although autobuilding failed, the electron density maps were dramatically better. The phases from ARP/wARP were then improved by NCS averaging to a resolution ° of 3 A using programs of the RAVE package27 together with SFALL, SIGMAA and FFT from the CCP4 suite. After six cycles of averaging, the map had improved sufficiently to allow the first coarse rebuilding of one

Experimental procedures
Cloning, protein expression and purification The sequence corresponding to Mt RpiB (Rv2465c) was amplified by PCR from M. tuberculosis DNA strain H37Rv5 using the primer pair 50 -GTTCTTGTCGCCGAA TTCACTATC-30 (forward) and 50 -GACGTAGTGATGGA ACAGGTGTTTG-30 (reverse) with Pfu polymerase. A second PCR reaction to introduce an N-terminal sixhistidine tag was performed with the same reverse primer and the forward primer 50 -ATGGCCCATCATCA TCATCATCATTCTGGTATGTCGGGCATGCGCGTCTAC30 using the product from the first PCR as template. The PCR product was incubated with dNTPs and Taq polymerase to create an A-overhang, purified and ligated into the vector pCRwT7 using the TOPOw Cloning pCRw kit (Invitrogen). The plasmid was transformed into Top10 cells (Invitrogen) by heat shock. Positive clones were selected for by growth on Luria agar plates containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin. Ten colonies where picked and cultured for plasmid preparation using the Qiaprepw Spin Miniprep kit protocol (Qiagen). The resulting DNA was transformed into E. coli BL21/AI where the protein was over-expressed after induction with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose at 37 8C for two hours. Of the ten clones selected, three gave a protein product of the correct molecular mass; one of these was chosen for further work. For protein production, BL21/AI cells containing the pCRT7:: Rv2465c plasmid were grown in Luria broth at 37 8C to an A550 of ,1.8. The culture was then transferred to 22 8C for 45 minutes, after which expression was induced with 0.02% arabinose; cells were harvested after an additional two hours of shaking at 22 8C. The cell pellet was washed with 1xSSPE buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA) and stored at 2 20 8C. For purification, thawed cells were re-suspended in native lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20% (v/v) glycerol) with 0.01 mg/ml RNase, 0.02 mg/ml DNase, 1 mM PMSF and lyzed by two passages through a French pressure cell. The cell-free extract (which contained most of the over-expressed protein) was incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) slurry for 45 minutes at 4 8C, washed and Mt RpiB eluted with 250 mM imidazole. After dialysis against 10 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol (b-ME), the protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml (using A280 ; 1 ¼ 0.97) using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience) with a molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa. The purified protein solution was evaluated by native gel electrophoresis (PhastSysteme, Amersham Biosciences), by separation on a size-exclusion chromato-

molecule, starting from a homology model generated using the E. coli structure as template in the program SOD.28 The rebuilt A molecule was then used to create new B, C and D molecules with the improved symmetry operators. These four subunits were subjected to ° restrained refinement in REFMAC529 to 2.5 A resolution. Masked NCS averaging was continued, gradually ° increasing the resolution to 2.2 A, until the R-factor converged at 35%. The A chain was again rebuilt and used to generate the three other molecules. The resulting model and ° phases were refined with NCSref (from CCP4) to 1.9 A for two cycles, after which the refinement was continued in REFMAC5 without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. At this stage, electron density became apparent for a fifth molecule. To place this subunit correctly, AMoRe was re-run using the improved subunit structure. Five clear solutions were found in the molecular replacement, giving a final correlation coefficient of 72%. The solutions corresponded to the two previous dimers, plus an additional subunit forming an identical dimer via crystallographic symmetry. Refinement with REFMAC5 was alternated with rebuilding and addition of water molecules with ARP/wARP. Statistics relating to the final refined structure are summarized in Table 1. Structural analysis, sequence and structural comparisons Surface accessibility calculations were carried out using the algorithm of Lee & Richards30 (probe radius ° 1.4 A). Subunit contact surfaces were analyzed using published methods.9 Similar structures were located using the DALI server,11 TOP,31 and hidden Markov models.32 Structures were manually compared using LSQMAN33,34 and O.25 Similar sequences identified using BLAST14 were obtained from GenBank,35 aligned using CLUSTAL W and coloured using BOXSHADE, as implemented at the ExPASy server. G þ C compositions were calculated using the server.36 Figures were prepared with O, Molray,37 and Canvas (Deneba Systems, Inc.) Docking experiments Docking of substrates and products was performed using Glide 2.5, a part of the FirstDiscovery38 suite of ¨ programs (Schrodinger L. L. C.). The ligands were built ¨ in Maestro, also from Schrodinger, and minimized in the mMFFs force field using the premin script. The protein structures were prepared for docking in a stepwise procedure. First hydrogen atoms were added using the program ICM from Molsoft, with the convertObject macro. In this process, all polar hydrogen atoms are placed by exhaustive sampling of different orientations, terminal amide groups of glutamine and asparagine residues are tested in two different orientations rotated 1808 compared to each other, and histidine residues are tested in two different tautomeric forms. The Mt RpiB structure has a phosphate in its active site, which was kept during the protein preparation. For the Ec RpiB structure (PDB entry 1NN4), a phosphate was placed in the corresponding position by superimposing the two orthologs, before adding hydrogen atoms.

1O8B,6 was prepared with the inhibitor arabinose-5phosphate from the crystal structure in place. Aspartate, glutamate, lysine and arginine residues were all ionized. Proteins with added hydrogen atoms were converted to Maestro format and minimized using the imprefscript, also part of the FirstDiscovery program package. In this step restrained minimization in the OPLS-AA force field is performed, terminating when the r.m.s. difference value between the starting structure and the minimized ° structure exceeds 0.3 A. Using the default settings, protein grid maps were prepared and the ligands were docked using the XP (extra precision) mode of Glide 2.5. Atomic coordinates Atomic coordinates and structure factor data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank12 with an entry code of 1USL.
