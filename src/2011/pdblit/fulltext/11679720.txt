The molecular structure of human uropepsin, an aspartic proteinase from the urine produced in the form of pepsinogen A in the gastric mucosa, has been determined by molecular replacement using human pepsin as the search model. Crystals belong to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = 50.99, b = 75.56, c = 89.90 A. Crystallographic re®nement Ê led to an R factor of 0.161 at 2.45 A resolution. The positions of 2437 non-H protein atoms in 326 residues have been determined and the model contains 143 water molecules. The structure is bilobal, consisting of two predominantly -sheet lobes which, as observed in other aspartic proteinases, are related by a pseudo-twofold axis. A model of the uropepsin± pepstatin complex has been constructed based on the high-resolution crystal structure of pepsin complexed with pepstatin.

1. Introduction
Aspartic proteinases (E.C. 3.4.23) form a class of proteolytic enzymes that share the same catalytic apparatus. Members of the aspartic proteinase family can be found in different organisms ranging from humans to plants and retroviruses. The best known sources are in the mammalian stomach, yeast and fungi, with porcine pepsin as the archetype, having been the ®rst enzyme in this family to be sequenced and crystallized (Szecsi, 1992). Aspartic proteinases are classi®ed as the fourth major class of proteolytic enzymes, distinct from the serine-, cysteine- and metalloproteinases (Hara et al., 1993). The functions of these enzymes are manifold, from non-speci®c digestion of proteins to highly specialized processing of proteinaceous substrates. The substrate-binding sites of aspartic proteinases, being extended, are capable of interacting with up to seven aminoacid residues of a substrate (Filippova et al., 1996). The aspartic proteinases are characterized by the presence of two aspartic acid residues at the active site. They tend to cleave between hydrophobic amino acids, but secondary interactions are important in the de®nition of their speci®city (Powers et al., 1977). Extensive homology between sequences has been observed among the enzymes belonging to this family. The catalytic apparatus in all the aspartic proteinases is virtually the same and the differences among these enzymes arise mainly from the differences in speci®city resulting from the structural evolution of the sites for substrate side-chain binding. The hypothesis that the aspartic proteinases share the same catalytic apparatus is also supported by the fact that they are universally inhibited by pepstatin, a transition-state analogue inhibitor (Marciniszyn et al., 1976).

The gastric proteinases consist of single polypeptidic chains with three intramolecular disul®de bridges. In the sequences of these enzymes there is a predominance of side-chain carboxyl groups and the presence of a relatively large number of residues of prolines and aromatic amino acids (Plebani, 1993). All the gastric proteinases have a high content of dicarboxylic and -hydroxy amino acids, but rather low contents of basic amino acids (Foltmann, 1981). Pepsin is produced by the human gastric mucosa in seven different zymogen isoforms (Foltmann, 1981). These have been subdivided into two types: pepsinogen A (PGA1-5) and pepsinogen C (PGC6 and 7), both consisting of molecular variants (isozymogens) that differ in net ionic charge (Samloff & Taggart, 1987). Pepsinogens are not secreted merely into the gastric lumen but also into the systemic circulation (Ten Kate et al., 1988). Pepsinogens A and C are translocated from the peptic cells into the circulation and are present in serum (Samloff & Townes, 1970). However, only pepsinogen A can be found in urine by electrophoresis (Samloff & Townes, 1970), indicating a different renal handling of pepsinogen A and pepsinogen C (Ten Kate et al., 1988). Studies comparing the proteolytic activity of serum and urine have shown that the amount of pepsinogens in the urine correlate with the levels in serum. The concentration of pepsinogens in the urine, however, exceeds serum levels by about 10±100 times (Hirschowitz et al., 1957), which indicates a high clearance rate from the blood (Ten Kate et al., 1988). The values of molecular weights of these proteins are around 40 000 Da for the zymogens and about 35 000 Da for the active enzymes. The zymogens have a relatively higher amount of basic amino acids and, where the sequence is known, these extra basic amino acids are located in the amino-terminal segment of the peptide chain. There is evidence suggesting that this is a general structural feature of zymogens for the gastric proteinases (Foltmann, 1981). At neutral pH, the zymogens are stabilized in an inactive conformation by means of electrostatic interactions between basic amino-acid residues in the N-terminal propart of the peptide chain and the negative charges of the dicarboxylic acids in the enzyme moiety of the enzyme. By lowering the pH the carboxyl groups become protonated and the zymogen molecules undergo a conformational change leading to enzymatic activity without cleavage of a peptide bond. At pH 2, this conformational change, in which the active site is uncovered, occurs as a ®rstorder reaction and the change is at least partly reversed by raising the pH (Foltmann, 1981). The reaction proceeds by autocatalytic limited proteolysis, which ®nally removes 42±47 amino-acid residues from the N-terminal end of the zymogens (Foltmann, 1988). Various enzymes are known to be secreted into human urine as normal components (Kuser et al., 1999). Changes in the activities of urinary enzymes are observed when our body conditions are physiologically abnormal (Rabb, 1972). The urinary enzymes have not been studied in detail and should be characterized for their origin organs and tissues, and their properties (Minamiura et al., 1984).

PGA and PGC are of medical interest as tumour markers. Low serum PGA levels are found in patients with atrophic gastritis (Samloff et al., 1982) or gastric cancer (Stemmerman et al., 1985). Recent mass screening also revealed that serum PGA levels and the PGA/PGC ratio are potentially useful parameters for the diagnosis of gastric cancer (Hattori et al., 1995). The properties of uropepsin obtained by activation of uropepsinogen were considered to be similar to those of human gastric pepsin. There is evidence that some amounts of the proenzyme produced in stomach tissue come into the bloodstream and ®nally into the urine, passing through the membranes of certain renal cells without undergoing any serious modi®cations (Minamiura et al., 1984). Tang (1976) incubated uropepsinogen with pepstatin at pH 6.8 and it was not converted to uropepsin even on subsequent incubation at pH 2.0 or upon addition of active pepsin. Also, no intermediate peptides were observed. These results suggest that the conversion of uropepsinogen to uropepsin takes place by autoactivation upon secretion into the urine and not by a bimolecular mechanism (Tang, 1976). On the other hand, it was made clear that the peptide segments liberated by activation of uropepsinogen have an important role in the stabilization of uropepsin, especially in the thermal and pH stabilities, as has been reported by Pearlmann (1963). Human pepsin consists of up to four isoforms of pepsinogen A with differing enzymatic properties (Tarasova et al., 1994). Uropepsin is one of these, which has the substitution Leu3Val at the position 291. There are residues contributing to the speci®city pockets in the different enzymes. Signi®cant differences in the types of interactions are observed in the S4, S3, S2, S1, SH1 , SH2 and SH3 pockets which may be responsible for the differences in speci®cities. The speci®cities of proteinases are often characterized by the amino-acid residues adjacent to the peptide bond which is hydrolysed, but substrate binding and speci®city may involve amino-acid residues which are located in positions two to four residues away from the peptide bond that is cleaved. In an aspartic proteinase with an extended binding site, the binding subsites (S) and the corresponding positions of amino-acid residues (P) are designated as shown below (Foltmann, 1981). cleavage 5 Peptide P4 ÀP3 ÀP2 ÀP1 ÀPH1 ÀPH2 ÀPH3 ÀPH4 Enzyme S4 ÀS3 ÀS2 ÀS1 ÀSH1 ÀSH2 ÀSH3 ÀSH4 X

The substitution of Leu291 by Val291 is likely to affect the speci®city at SH3 and perhaps also at SH1 (Fujinaga et al., 1995). This article describes the structure of human uropepsin and its model with the pepstatin inhibitor. The investigation was made in order to gain further insight into the chemistry and functions of this protein.

mounted in capillary tubes of borosilicate glass for X-ray data collection (Canduri et al., 1998).
2.4. Data collection

Human uropepsin has been extracted from the urine of healthy young individuals without renal disease. The urine was stored in bottles containing 6.0 M HCl solution. 5 l of this urine was ®ltered and dialyzed against destilled water. The solution was concentrated to a ®nal volume of 50 ml and lyophilized. Uropepsin was puri®ed using the same procedure as described for human pepsin (Gomes et al., 1996). Brie¯y, uropepsin puri®cation was performed by a three-step procedure: DEAE bio gel (Biorad) chromatography, Mono Q 5/5 HR column (Pharmacia) chromatography (FPLC) and gel ®ltration (FPLC) on a Superdex 10/75 column (Pharmacia).
2.2. Catalytic activity

Kinetic parameters were measured by the hydrolysis of a synthetic ¯uorogenic peptide containing at the extremities the chromophore O-aminobenzoyl (Abz) and its quenching partner N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) ethylenediamine (Eddnp), which are separated by eight amino-acid residues including two consecutive phenylalanine residues (Filippova et al., 1996). Cleavage of the peptide between these hydrophobic residues results in the separation of two fragments and the consequent dequenching of the Abz, which leads to an increase in the ¯uorescence signal. Catalytic activity from pepsin 3A shows the value for Km is 1.53 Æ 0.11 mM and kcat is 5.92 Æ 0.21 sÀ1. For uropepsin, the value for Km is 1.76 Æ 0.09 mM and kcat is 6.01 Æ 0.11 sÀ1, using Abz-Lys-ProIle-Glu-Phe-Phe-Arg-Leu-Eddnp as synthetic substrate in 0.2 M acetate buffer pH 5.0. The concentration of the substrate varied in the range 0.117À5.66 mM. kcat values were calculated after titration of the active site with pepstatin.
2.3. Crystallization

Crystals of uropepsin were obtained in several different crystallization conditions using the hanging-drop vapourdiffusion and sparse-matrix methods (Jancarik & Kim, 1991). The best crystals were obtained after one week from drops in which 3 ml of enzyme solution was mixed with an equal volume of 0.1 M HEPES buffer pH 7.0 containing 2% polyethylene glycol 400 and 2.0 M ammonium sulfate. Crystals were

X-ray diffraction data were ®rstly collected from a single urinary aspartic proteinase crystal at room temperature using an R-AXIS IV imaging-plate system and graphitemonochromated Cu K X-rays radiation generated by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating-anode generator operated at 50 kV and 100 mA at a crystal-to-detector distance of 150 mm. 40 frames were collected using an oscillation range of 2.5 . The exposure time per frame was 20 min. The X-ray diffraction Ê data were processed to 2.8 A resolution and scaled using the program PROCESS (Higashi, 1990). A second X-ray diffracÊ tion data set was collected at a wavelength of 1.38 A using the Brazilian National Synchrotron Laboratory (Station PCr, Â Â Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Sõncrotron, LNLS, Campinas, Brazil; Polikarpov, Oliva et al., 1998; Polikarpov, Oliva et al., 1998) and a 34.5 cm MAR imaging-plate detector (MAR Research) with an exposure time of 3 min per image at a crystal-to-detector distance of 175 mm. Using an oscillation range of 1.5 , 65 images were collected and the raw X-ray Ê diffraction data were processed to 2.45 A resolution using the program DENZO (Gewirth, 1995) and scaled with the program SCALEPACK (Gewirth, 1995). Autoindexing procedures combined with analysis of the X-ray diffraction pattern and averaging of equivalent intensities were used in characterization of the Laue symmetry (Canduri et al., 1998). The crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group Ê P212121 and the volume of the unit cell is 346 Â 103 A3, compatible with one monomer in the asymmetric unit with a Ê VM value of 2.17 A3 DaÀ1. Assuming a value of 0.74 cm3 gÀ1 for the protein partial speci®c volume, the calculated solvent content in the crystal is 43.3% and the calculated crystal density is 1.21 g cmÀ3. The X-ray diffraction data statistics are summarized in Table 1.
2.5. Crystal structure

The crystal structure of human uropepsin was determined by standard molecular-replacement methods with the È programs AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and X-PLOR (Brunger,

1992), using as search model the structure of human pepsin (Fujinaga et al., 1995). Structure re®nement was performed È using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). The atomic positions obtained from molecular replacement were used to initiate the Ê crystallographic re®nement with an overall B factor of 20 A2.

Several attempts at cocrystallizing uropepsin with pepstatin did not produce crystals of high quality. A model of the uropepsin±pepstatin complex has been constructed. The model was based on the high-resolution crystal structure of pepsin complexed with pepstatin. The protein modelling was performed by superposition of the three domains of the pepsin part of the pepsin±pepstatin complex (PDB code 1pso; Fujinaga et al., 1995) onto the uropepsin structure using the program ProFit V. 1.8 (Martin, 1992±1998). The coordinates of the pepstatin were obtained using HIC-Up (http:// xray.bmc.uu.se/hicup/). The pepstatin model was moved as a rigid body to approximately the same relative orientation as the pepstatin in the binary complex (1pso) without any modi®cation of the side-chain positions of the pepstatin. The coordinates of the complex were È minimized using the program X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) through 200 cycles of positional re®nement with the weight of the X-ray term of energy function set to zero. During the 200 cycles of positional re®nement the energy decreases from 12 Â 106 to 13 250 kJ molÀ1. This model was used for comparisons with the binary complex pepsin±pepstatin. Root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) differences from ideal geometries for bond lengths, angles and È dihedrals were calculated with X-PLOR 3.1 (Brunger, 1992) and are presented in Table 2. The overall stereochemical quality of the ®nal model for uropepsin was assessed with PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Atomic models were superposed using the program LSQKAB from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994).

Peak analysis of the self-rotation function did not reveal the presence of any signi®cant local symmetry axis, suggesting that a single subunit is contained in the asymmetric unit. This was in agreement with the estimated values of the crystal solvent content and VM value (Matthews, 1968). The results of molecular replacement using ten different search models are listed in Table 3. The correlation coef®cients after translation function computation range from 14.4 to 67.8% and the R

factors range from 35.0 to 54.1%. The highest peak calculated for the translation function using AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) was 42.8% above the next highest peak. The search model which presented the best correlation coef®cient and R factor was pepsin 3A from Homo sapiens (PDB code 1psn). This search model was also submitted to molecular replacement using the program X-PLOR and the solution obtained after the translation search was  = 23.6,  = 47.0,  = 59.8 , x = 0.314, y = 0.029, z = 0.443, R = 34.6%, close to that obtained by AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Translation functions for space groups P222, P2221 and P21212 have been computed using the coordinates of pepsin 3A as the search model and the results are listed in Table 4. The correlation coef®cients after translation-function computation for the three space groups range from 26.4 to 38.0% and the R factors range from 46.4 to 51.1%, which strongly indicates that the correct space group is P212121.

The substitution of Leu291 by Val291 was performed and the modi®ed model was submitted to crystallographic re®nement using slow-cooling protocols as implemented in the program È X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992). The evolution of the values of R and Rfree over six stages of the re®nement is shown in Fig. 2. At the end of the re®nement, after adding water molecules and Ê analyzing the temperature factors [values above 60 A were removed from the model and new analysis of the (Fobs ÀFcalc) map was carried out], the R factor was 16.1% and Rfree was 25.1%, with 143 molecules of water in the ®nal model. The human uropepsin consists of 2437 non-H protein atoms. The overall quality of the of electron-density map can be seen in Fig. 3. The active site is shown with the two aspartate residues (Asp32 and Asp215). The atomic coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank.
3.2. Quality of the models

Fig. 4 shows the Ramachandran diagram 9±2 plot. The overall rating for the model is `good'. In native uropepsin, 84.2% of the residues are found to occur in the most favoured regions (A, B, L) of the plot. Two residues (Asp11 and Asp158) fall in the generously allowed regions of the map (Fig. 4), but analysis of the electron-density map (2Fobs À Fcalc) agrees with their positioning. There are 34 glycine residues and 17 proline residues in the protein.

aspartic proteinases, are related by a pseudo-twofold axis. The structure of human uropepsin follows closely the structure of porcine pepsin described previously (Cooper et al., 1990). The uropepsin structure can be divided in three domains analogous to the three domains of porcine pepsin (Sielecki et al., 1990). The central domain consists of a six-stranded antiparallel -sheet that serves as a backbone to the active-site region of the molecule. It is made up of residues Val1±Leu6, Asp149±Val184 and Glu308±Ala326. The N-terminal lobe is composed of residues Glu7±Gln148 and the C-terminal lobe is made up of residues Thr185±Arg307. The lobes consist of orthogonally packed -sheets with the N- and C-terminal lobes having three and two layers, respectively. The overall structure and its division into three domains can be appreciated in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 shows the r.m.s.d. plot of the superposition of the uropepsin with the pepsin 3A. It is important to remember that the primary sequence of uropepsin is the same as that of pepsin 3A, except for residue 291 (Leu3Val). We accomplished three superpositions (i) using all protein atoms (except for the atoms of residue 291), (ii) using the main-chain atoms (C, C, N, O) and (iii) the C atoms. The overall r.m.s.d. Ê for the ®rst superposition was 0.737 A; for Ê the main chain it was 0.528 A and for the C Ê atoms it was 0.529 A. Two residues showed r.m.s.d.s larger than Ê 2.5 A, as can be seen in Fig. 6(c). One of Ê them was Asp158 (r.m.s.d. of 2.64 A). This residue is in the region generously allowed in the Ramachandran plot for the uropepsin structure; nevertheless, it is inside the electron-density map. The other residue Ê was Glu294 (r.m.s.d. of 2.91 A). The reason for this value is that Glu294 is exposed to solvent, possessing great ¯exibility in both structures.

Ignoring low-resolution data, a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) gives the best correlation between the observed and calculated data for a predicted mean coordinate error Ê of 0.19 A.

Fig. 7 illustrates the wide variation in residue-averaged B factors for both mainchain and side-chain atoms in the ®nal model. The average B factor for main-chain Ê atoms is 15.0 A2, whereas that for side-chain Ê atoms is 14.1 A2. B factors for water moleÊ cules range from 12.24 to 46.81 A2, with an Ê 2 (Table 2). average of 29.5 A Although the pepsin structure has been solved at a resolution higher than that of uropepsin, several regions of the pepsin structure have high B factors, indicating disorder. The same regions in the uropepsin

structure present much lower B factors. This is probably because of the lower solvent content of the uropepsin crystals.
3.6. Crystal contacts and packing

Intermolecular contacts in the uropepsin crystal have been analyzed. Although many water-mediated intermolecular hydrogen-bonding contacts exist, only salt bridges or hydrogen bonds formed directly between the uropepsin molecules are listed in Table 5. An equivalent table has been constructed for pepsin 3A (Table 6). Particularly interesting is the fact that both enzymes were crystallized in the same space group, P212121, although with different unit-cell parameters. The unit-cell parameters for pepsin are a = 71.97, b = 151.59, Ê Ê c = 41.15 A, with the unit-cell volume 449 Â 103 A3 and a VM Ê value of 3.24 A3 DaÀ1. The solvent content is 60.5% and the calculated crystal density is 1.13 g cmÀ3.

Fig. 8 shows the crystal packing for the structures of the human uropepsin and pepsin. There are four molecules in the unit cell in both structures and the packing is closer with less solvent in uropepsin (Vsolv = 43.3%) compared with pepsin. The uropepsin structure has a total of ten intermolecular contacts compared with 28 observed in human pepsin (PDB code 1psn; Fujinaga et al., 1995). The intermolecular contacts were calculated using DISTANG (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). The cutoff for intermolecular Ê contacts ranges from 2.5 to 3.7 A, depending on the atom type and using standard van der Waals radii. The residues involved in the contacts are different in both proteins. The main residues involved in intermolecular contacts are Glu69, Gln90, Tyr113, Ser226, Ser253 and Asp257 for uropepsin, and Glu3, Ser46, Leu48, Ser68, Thr70, Asp171, Ser248 and Ser250 for pepsin. This difference is a consequence of a different relative orientation in the molecular packing observed between the two crystal structures.
3.7. Comparison with other human enzymes

The amino-acid sequence of human uropepsin is compared with those of the other human aspartic proteinases as well as with that of porcine pepsin in Fig. 9. The sequence identities between uropepsin and other aspartic proteinases are 86.5% for porcine pepsin, 52% for human cathepsin E, 54% for human renin, 48% human cathepsin D and 34% for human gastricsin. Table 7 shows the r.m.s.d. of the equivalent C atoms after superposition with the program PROFIT (McLachlan, 1982). The largest r.m.s.d.s are observed between uropepsin and human cathepsin D, and between uropepsin and renin. The structural similarity correlates with the similarity in the sequences.
3.8. Interactions with pepstatin and substrate-binding sites

A total of 14 hydrogen bonds were observed between uropepsin and pepstatin, most of them involving the catalytic aspartates (Asp32 and Asp215). The hydrogen-bonding pattern between the inhibitor and the enzyme is well conserved in other structurally determined complexes with pepstatin (Suguna et al., 1992; Bailey et al., 1993; Baldwin et al., 1993). The hydrogen-bonding distances between Asp32 and Asp215 in uropepsin and Sta404 (statine) in pepstatin are compatible with the pepsin complex; however, the hydrogen-bonding distances between Thr77±Val403 and Gly217±Sta404 of uropepsin and inhibitor are greater than those observed for the complex of pepsin and pepstatin (Fig. 10; Table 8). As observed for crystallographic structures of complexes of inhibitors bound to aspartic proteinases, pepstatin in the modelled complex adopts an extended conformation, with the ®rst statyl hydroxyl O atom occupying a

position in the active site between the carboxyl groups of Asp32 and Asp215. The speci®city and af®nity between enzyme and its inhibitor depend on directional hydrogen bonds and ionic interactions, as well as on the shape complementarity of the contact surfaces of both partners (de Azevedo et al., 1996, 1997; Kim et al., 1996). The electrostatic potential surface of native uropepsin and the model complex with pepstatin were calculated with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). The same was performed with

native and inhibited pepsin 3A. The two molecular surfaces were compared considering coordinates of the native and inhibited proteins. There is a conformational change in the structure when the inhibitor binds in the active site. The change is relatively small, with an r.m.s.d. difference in the Ê coordinates of all the C atoms of 0.33 A after superposition Ê for uropepsin. It can be clearly seen for pepsin 3A and 0.44 A as a relative movement of the domains to enclose the inhibitor more closely in both binary complexes (Fig. 11). We could observe that the overall structures of uropepsin and pepsin 3A are mostly negatively charged. The structures have few histidine (1), lysine (0) and arginine (3) residues. The active sites are strongly negative, as shown in Fig. 11. The binding sites from S4 to SH3 are de®ned by the interactions of the residues P4 to PH3 of the inhibitor with the enzyme. It is unlikely that there are additional binding sites beyond these sites. The main-chain N atom of the PH3 residue forms a hydrogen bond to Thr74. The S4 pocket is ¯at and very accessible to solvent. The pockets S1 and S3 are contiguous, with the carbonyl O atom of Gly217 providing some separation of the two pockets. The S1 pocket tends to be hydrophobic in nature, whereas the S3 pocket is mainly polar. The S2 and SH1 pockets are mainly hydrophobic. The SH2 pocket is clearly

The only difference observed between pepsin 3A and uropepsin is the substitution Leu3Val at position 291, located in SH3 pocket. Nevertheless, it seems that this substitution in the binding pocket does not affect the kcat values: the values of kcat determined for uropepsin and pepsin using the same substrate are 6.01 Æ 0.11 and 5.92 Æ 0.21 sÀ1, respectively. Furthermore, the substitution Leu3Val keeps the hydrophobicity in the SH3 pocket and the position adopted by the valine side chain does not affect the substrate binding. The hydrogen bonds between Thr77±Val403 and Gly217± Sta404 observed in the pepsin±pepstatin complex are not observed in the uropepsin±pepstatin complex (Table 8). However, a close examination of the binary complexes pepsin±pepstatin and the model of uropepsin±pepstatin shows clearly that the inhibitor adopts the same orientation in both complexes (Fig. 12). Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds between Asp32 and Asp215 and the inhibitor are conserved in both complexes. This structural similarity con®rms the same activity against pepstatin observed in the two enzymes. Ä We thank Mr J. R. Brandao Neto and Dr I.
