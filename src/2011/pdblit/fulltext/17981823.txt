Orotidine 50 -monophoshate decarboxylase (OMPDC) catalyses the decarboxylation of orotidine 50 -monophosphate (OMP) to uridine 50 -monophosphate (UMP). Here, we report the X-ray analysis of apo, substrate or product-complex forms of OMPDC ° from Plasmodium falciparum (PfOMPDC) at 2.7, 2.65 and 2.65 A, respectively. The structural analysis provides the substrate recognition mechanism with dynamic structural changes, as well as the rearrangement of the hydrogen bond array at the active site. The structural basis of substrate or product binding to PfOMPDC will help to uncover the decarboxylation mechanism and facilitate structure-based optimization of antimalarial drugs. Key words: apo form, OMP-complex, orotidine 50 -monophoshate decarboxylase, structural comparison, UMP-complex, x-ray structural analysis.
Abbreviations: OMP, orotidine 50 -monophosphate; OMPDC, OMP decarboxylase; PfOMPDC, OMPDC from Plasmodium falciparum; OPRT, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase; SDS­PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate­ polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Human malaria is caused by four species of the parasitic protozoan genus Plasmodium. Of these four species, Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for the vast majority of the 500 million episodes of malaria worldwide, and accounts for 2­3 million deaths annually (1). Chemotherapy of malaria is available, but is complicated by drug toxicity and widespread resistance to most of the currently available antimalarial drugs (2). There is an urgent need for more efficacious and less-toxic agents, particularly rational drugs that exploit pathways and targets unique to the parasite. In general, drug-screening procedures have rarely been applied to this disease, and there is a paucity of information on a number of biochemical pathways that can be exploited for chemotheraphy. The malarial parasite is totally dependent on de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis for its growth and development because it lacks the relevant salvage enzymes (3­5). The de novo pathway contains six reaction steps. The initial reaction catalysed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase is the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by combination of carbonate, ATP and an amino group from glutamine. Three additional reactions are necessary to form the pyrimidine ring from carbamoyl phosphate. In the final

two steps, uridine 50 -monophosphate (UMP) requires the addition of a ribose phosphate moiety from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to orotate by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10, OPRT) to form orotidine 50 -monophosphate (OMP) and pyrophosphate (PPi), and the subsequently decarboxylation of OMP to form UMP, by OMP decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23, OMPDC). In most prokaryotes and yeasts (6, 7), the OPRT and OMPDC enzymes are encoded by two separate genes, while in most multicellular eukaryotes, the genes for both enzymes have been joined into a single gene, resulting in the expression of a bifunctional protein, namely UMP synthase, with two different catalytic domains (8­11). The bifunctional UMP synthase has also been reported in kinetoplastid parasites, e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania mexicana (12, 13). In contrast, mammalian hosts can utilize both the de novo and salvage pathways (8, 14). Inhibitors of the de novo pathway have strong antimalarial activity for in vitro P. falciparum growth (15­18). The sequence alignment for 10 known crystal structures of OMPDC is shown in Fig. 1. This reveals the existence of 11 totally conserved amino acid residues (shaded in red), corresponding to Asp23, Lys102, Asp136, Lys138, Asp141, Ile142, Gly169, Pro264, Gly265, Gly293 and Arg294 in P. falciparum. The alanine replacement around the active site, however, shows that Plasmodium OMPDCs have somewhat different sequences (19). The most striking observation is that a large insertion 69

is present at the N-terminal domain, in all Plasmodium OMPDCs. It has been proposed that the N-terminal domain of PfOMPDC binds to that of P. falciparum OPRT (PfOPRT) (20). Currently, the most accredited mechanisms involve direct decarboxylation of OMP (21). This was proposed

based on X-ray analysis of the structure of OMPDC­ inhibitor complexes (22­28), and is supported by a wealth of theoretical and experimental studies (22, 29­31). It has been proposed that the protonation/decarboxylation of OMP could be a concerted event at the direct decarboxylation (23). In contrast, some other experimental

Structural Basis of P. Falciparum OMP evidence supports the formation of a carboanionic intermediate upon decarboxylation (32, 33). In both cases, kinetic studies have unambiguously identified Lys72 (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum numbering) as the residue that protonates the C6 center (21, 34, 35). Another recently proposed catalytic mechanism assumes a preliminary protonation of the uracil ring far from the decarboxylation center. Kollman (36), assuming a protonated Asp70, has proposed as a first step in decarboxylation, an interesting mechanism involving an enamine protonation at C5 carried out by the Lys72 residue (M. thermoautotrophicum numbering). Furthermore, based on ab initio calculations, it has been proposed that O2 and O4 are protonated prior to decarboxylation (36, 37). The latest proposals for this reaction mechanism strongly support direct decarboxylation of OMP, with the formation of a carboanionic intermediate via a transitionstate stabilization mechanism, in which the fully conserved Lys72 (M. thermoautotrophicum numbering) plays a fundamental role by stabilizing the forming negative charge at C6, and consequently, the transition state (31). In this study, we report the X-ray analysis of the apo, substrate- and product-complex forms of OMPDC from P. falciparum (PfOMPDC). This structural analysis provides us with a substrate recognition mechanism with dynamic structural changes, as well as the rearrangement of the hydrogen-bond array occurring during enzymatic catalysis at the active site. We also propose a protruding domain at the N-terminal insertion of PfOMPDC is responsible for binding to PfOPRT.

71 5 mM dithiothreitol. The enzyme activity was eluted as a single symmetrical peak at a position of 76 kDa. SDS­ PAGE analysis (38) showed that the homogeneous preparation had a molecular mass of 38 kDa. The active form of PfOMPDC was a dimer. OMPDC activity was monitored by a decrease in absorbance of OMP at 285 nm, as described previously (11). The purified recombinant enzyme had a specific activity of $10 mmol minÀ1 (mg protein)À1, 300-fold purification, and 30% yield. Up to 30 mg pure recombinant protein was obtained from 10 L of the E. coli cell culture. The purified protein was concentrated by Centricon ultrafiltration to 10 mg mLÀ1, and the homogeneity was confirmed by dynamic light scattering with DynaPro-MS/X (Protein Solutions). Data Collection and Processing--The apo form was crystallized by a previously reported method (39). Complex crystals with OMP or UMP were prepared by soaking in a solution containing 10 mM OMP or UMP for 2 min. X-ray diffraction data from the apo form were collected at X06SA beamline (Swiss Light Source, Switzerland) and from OMP- or UMP-complex at BL38 beamline (SPring-8, Japan). Prior to data collection, crystals of apo form and OMP- or UMP-complex of PfOMPDC were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of 23% (w/v) PEG3K, 0.1 M CHES (pH 9.5) and 8% glycerol. The apo form and OMP- or UMP-complex were then mounted in a standard nylon loop in a stream of liquid nitrogen at 100 K. The diffraction patterns were recorded on a MarCCD detector (Mar Research) for the apo form, and on an ADSC Quantum detector (Area Detector Systems Corporation) for the complexes at cryogenic temperature (100 K). The diffraction intensity data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM (40) and HKL2000 (41). The statistics of the diffraction data collection are shown in Table 1. Structure Determination and Refinement--The molecular replacement calculations were performed with the program MOLREP (42) in the CCP4 program package (43), using the PO4-complex of PfOMPDC (PDB code: 2f84) as the search model. A dimer molecule was located in an asymmetric unit of the crystal. Structure models of the apo form were refined against the diffraction data using CNS (44) and REFMAC (45). The models were manually adjusted by electron density map using COOT (46). Even after several cycles of refinement, the electron density for residues 70­74 and 268­274 for one subunit, and 68­70 and 268­272 for the other subunit, was poor. Some other parts of the side chain structure (residues 1, 35, 69, 75, 76, 79, 199, 201, 255, 269, 275, 281, 301, 306, 314, 317 and 318 for one subunit; and residues 1, 71, 96, 174, 207, 222, 231, 255, 266, 269, 273, 274, 275, 281, 306, 314, 317 and 318 for the other subunit) also had poor electron density. The models for these residues were built by using alanine. All models were refined for a few cycles of CNS with B-factor refinement until convergence. The coordinates of the apo, and OMP- or UMP-complex forms of PfOMPDC was deposited as 2ZA2, 2ZA1 and 2ZA3 in the Protein Data Bank. Final refinement statistics for the refined coordinate sets for three structures are shown in Table 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Protein Expression and Purification--The recombinant OMPDC protein was prepared by cloning and expression of the gene encoding PfOMPDC in Escherichia coli. The oligonucleotide primers were 50 -CGG GAT CCA TGG GTT TTA AGG TAA AAT TA-30 and 50 -CCA TCG ATT TAC GAT TCC ATA TTT TGC TTT AA-30 , which includes encompass BamHI and ClaI restriction sites (in bold), respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) at 958C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 958C for 1 min, 558C for 1 min and 688C for 3 min, with a final 688C for 10 min. The expected 980 bp product for full-length PfOMPDC was inserted into the linearized expression vector pTrcHis-TOPO (Invitrogen). Escherichia coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmid and induced with 1 mM isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 378C for 18­20 h, and the cell paste was harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min. The recombinant enzyme was expressed as a soluble protein, and further purified by using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column (Qiagen) with 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole and 10% glycerol as the eluting buffer. Further purification was achieved using a Superdex-75 ¨ Hiload 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) on AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl,

RESULTS

° Overall Structure--The 2.7 A structure of the apo form of PfOMPDC was solved with R and Rfree values of 21.6 and 31.2, respectively, by using the MR method with the PO4-complex of PfOMPDC. PfOMPDC was crystallized in the trigonal space group of R3. One dimer molecule existed in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2a). The dimer interface was consisted of 10 hydrogen-bond interactions, Lys138(A)-Asp141(B), Asn140(A)-Asn165(B), Asn140(A)Lys138(B), Asp141(A)-Lys138(B), Lys151(A)-Glu26(B), Asn165(A)-Asn140(B), Asn165(A)-Asn165(B), Asn196(A)Met168(B), Asp198(A)-Asn171(B) and Asp198(A)Thr170(B) (Fig. 2b). Each OMPDC subunit of this dimeric enzyme folded as an (a/b)8 barrel, with eight central b-sheets surrounded by 13 a helices (Fig. 2c). b1, residues 18­21; b2, 100­104; b3, 132­139; b4, 161­164; b5, 187­193; b6, 237­241; b7, 261­263; and b8, 288­292; and a1, residues 3­14; a2, 26­37; a3, 42­47; a4, 60­64; a5, 78­94; a6, 113­128; a7, 143­154; a8, 173­176; a9, 200­203; a10, 213­227; a11, 246­255; a12, 276­279 and a13, 302­315. There were three extra short a helices: Z1, residues 51­54; Z2, 105­108 and Z3, 230­233 (Fig. 2d). As predicted from protein sequence analysis (Fig. 1), there was a large insertion region (48­86), forming a3, Z1 and a4 helices and extended a5-helix (Fig. 2b). Also PfOMPDC contained a small insertion region (208­217), extended a10 helix. These insertions are not found in other characterized OMPDC structures outside of the Plasmodium species, and appear to be a unique structural feature of the Plasmodium OMPDCs. The active site was located at the open end of the (a/b)8 barrel, which corresponded to the carboxy-terminal of the b strands and the amino-terminal of the a helices. In the apo structure, the L1 loop comprised of residues 268­274 was disordered around the active site, while the L1 loop structure was stabilized upon binding of substrate

or product. The detailed structural comparison between the apo and holo form is described later. Structural Changes of L1 and L2 Loops upon Binding of OMP/UMP--The structural analysis of PfOMPDC complexes has been performed with R and Rfree values ° of 20.8 and 28.3, respectively for the 2.65 A structure complexed with OMP, and 21.1 and 29.4, respectively, ° for the 2.65 A with UMP. Comparison between the apo and OMP- or UMPcomplex of PfOMPDC showed a root-mean-square devia° tion of 0.75 and 0.74 A, respectively, by using for 318 structurally equivalent Ca atom positions. Several notable structural differences were found around the active site near the open end of the (a/b)8 barrel upon binding of OMP or UMP. The L1 loop which was not determined in the apo form, was stabilized upon binding of the ligands, preventing from solvent. Glu269 in the L1 loop access to the pyrimidine ring moiety of OMP or UMP formed the loop structure of L1 (Fig. 3a). While the structure of the a9 helix was formed in the L2 loop region (194­213) in the apo form, the secondary structure unfolded in the presence of OMP or UMP, associated with the movement of Thr195 (Fig. 3b). The difference in Ca position and the dihedral ° bond angle of Cb­Cg in Thr195 was calculated to be 3.8 A and 149.18, respectively, between the apo and OMP° complex; and 3.6 A and 150.08, respectively, between the apo and UMP-complex. It was revealed that both the L1 and L2 loops recognized the pyrimidine ring with the large structural changes. The details of the structural changes to the active site of PfOMPDC are described later. Change in Active-Site Structure upon Binding of OMP/UMP--Schematic drawings of the OMP- or UMPcomplex are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively.

or UMP, as did the amide of Gly293. Thr145(B) and Asn104 hydrogen-bonded to the 20 - and 30 -hydroxyl group of the ribose ring, respectively. In the top part of the pyrimidine ring, comprising O4, N3 and O2, there were hydrogen bonds to Thr195 and Gln269. Thr195 accepted a hydrogen bond from N3 and donated a hydrogen bond to O4. A pocket near C5 of the pyrimidine ring was surrounded by several hydrophobic residues of Ile142(B), Leu191, Thr194, Val240 and Pro264 (not shown in Fig. 4a). Compared with the apo form, there was a change in active-site structure upon ligand binding. Arg294 and Thr195 in L2, and Gln269 in L1 exhibited a large structural movement upon binding of OMP or UMP. The averaged movement of three nitrogen positions in the guanidium residue of Arg294 were both calculated ° to be 2.9 A for the OMP- or UMP-complexes, and the dihedral angles of Cd­Ne and Ne­Cz of Arg294 are 120.18 and 87.28 for OMP-, and 64.68 and 118.28 for UMPcomplexes, respectively. The helix structure of a12 did not change, while the L1 and L2 loops had the large structural movements described earlier. The average difference in the top part of residues Thr195 and Arg294 ° was measured to be 1.5 and 1.6 A, respectively for OMPand UMP-complexes. On the other hand, in the bottom part of the active site, the Ca atom of Gln293, Asn104 and Thr145(B) adopted almost the same positions between the

apo and complex forms. The average difference in the bottom part of residues Asn104, Thr145(B) and Gln293 ° was 0.3 A for both the OMP- and UMP-complexes. The binding mode of OMP was basically the same as that of UMP, except for the residue Lys102. In the OMP binding form, Lys102 hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate oxygen of pyrimidine. After decarboxylation, Lys102 changed the hydrogen bond to O5 of ribose (Fig. 4). Rearrangement of Hydrogen-Bond Network Around Lys102--In the apo form, Lys102 formed a hydrogenbond network with Asp136, Lys138 and Asp141 from the other protomer of the dimer (Fig. 5a). The conserved catalytic array of Lys102-Asp136-Lys138-Asp141(B) makes the hydrogen-bond network at the active site. The amino group of Lys102 recognized the carboxyl group of OMP, and then the distance between Lys102° Asp136 was lengthened from 2.7 to 3.6 A, breaking the hydrogen bond between Lys102 and Asp136 upon binding of OMP (Fig. 5b and d). The UMP binding form (Fig. 5c and e), which mimicked the structure after decarboxylation, possessed two hydrogen bonds at Lys102-Asp136 and Lys138-Asp141(B) (Fig. 5c). In the UMP-complex, Lys102 hydrogen bonded to Asp136 instead of the carboxyl group of the pyrimidine ring, breaking the hydrogen bond between Asp136 and Lys138, after decarboxylation.

The observed rearrangement of the hydrogen-bond network based on the structural determination of the apo form and OMP- and UMP-complex in Plasmodium OMPDCs is the first report.
DISCUSSION

The details of the reaction mechanism have been proposed by Raugei et al. (31), that a very stable charged network OMP-Lys-Asp-Lys-Asp promotes transition state electrostatic stabilization, and fully conserved Lys138 (PfOMPDC numbering) largely contributes to the stabilization of the transition state or equivalently, the carboanionic intermediate. In this study, in an attempt to provide further proofof-principle, we have determined the X-ray structure of the apo, substrate or product-complex forms of PfOMPDC. These three kinds of structural analyses provided an insight into the rearrangement of the hydrogen network in the array of OMP-Lys-Asp-LysAsp, by comparison between the initial and completion stages of the decarboxyl reaction. At the initial reaction step, the side chain of Lys102 broke a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of Asp136, and then formed a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl oxygen atom of the substrate, upon binding OMP. These processes increased the negative charge on the two carboxyl groups on the

substrate and Asp136, which led to electrostatic repulsion between the carboxyl groups. Even the short ° distance of 2.5 A between the two carboxyl groups, and the positively charged residues of Lys102 and Lys138 maintained the unstable structure. Then, the decarboxylation reaction started from the structure with electrostatic repulsion. After direct decarboxylation, the newly generated carboanion at the C6 position of the pyrimidine ring may have been stabilized by the conserved array, and absorbed a proton from the Lys138 side chain directly (31). In the completion step, two pairs of hydrogen bonds, Lys102Asp136 and Lys138-Asp141(B), were formed, and all of the electrostatic charge in the array was compensated (Fig. 5c). It seems to be difficult, however, to specify from our structural models which Lys residues stabilized the forming carboanion intermediate in the transition state. Ning Wu et al. (47) reported the mutational study for this enzyme from M. thermoautotrophicum. Asp70 and Lys72 (corresponding to Asp136 and Lys138, respectively, in P. falciparum) were mutated to an alanine, however those mutants still had enzymatic activity to convert from OMP to UMP, indicating Asp70 cannot be the only driving force for decarboxylation. The same argument can be made for Lys72, and then the mechanism of protonation as well as that of decarboxylation was not specified completely.

phosphoribosyltransferase reaction before the decarboxylation reaction. On the other hand, PfOMPDC forms a complex with orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), which forms a heterotetrameric complex in P. falciparum (20). In our multiple sequence alignment, we found

76 a unique structural feature of the OMPDCs belonging to Plasmodium. A large insertion was observed between b1 and a5, which formed a protruding domain consisting of three a helices, a2, a3 and a4. We propose that the unique insertion may participate in making a complex with OPRT. In our structural observations, the top part of the active site played a role in substrate binding, accompanied by large structural movement. The average ° difference of 1.5 A in the top part is twice the rootmean-square deviation calculated from all Ca atoms. Eleven structures of OMPDC have been reported. Among them four kind of nucleotide complex structures are available to compare with those of apo forms to date. Each of OMPDC from M. thermoautotrophicum, P. horikoshii, E. coli and S. cerevisiae showed a large structural change around the active site near the open end of the (a/b)8 barrel upon binding of the nucleotide. The structure of each loop which corresponds to the L1 loop in PfOMPDC was stabilized by making hydrogen bond with the pyrimidine ring moiety of nucleotide ligands, which is same manner as our complex showed. On the other hand, the OMPDCs from three species except S. cerevisiae retained the structure of a-helix which correspond to a9 near the L2 loop region in PfOMPDC, did not display any structural changes upon binding of nucleotide ligands. PfOMPDC has long insertion after a9 helix which makes the L2 loop harder to access to pyrimidine moiety. Therefore a9 helix needs to be unfold upon binding OMP or UMP in PfOMPDC. On the contrary, the bottom part of the active site was significantly rigid; the average difference was half of the overall root-mean-square deviation. Even a small difference, such as the rearrangement of hydrogen bonds in the array of OMP-Lys-Asp-Lys-Asp, may have played a pivotal role in catalysis. The corresponding residues for binding and catalysing showed >80% consensus among all the OMPDCs, and the structural movements described earlier may be in common with them. In summary, we have proposed a reaction mechanism and characteristic domain for binding of Plasmodium OPRT, as inferred from structural analyses of apo and holo forms. Future studies on the structural analyses of complexes with transition state analogues will unravel the stabilization mechanism of the carboanion intermediate. The structural analysis of the complex between PfOMPDC and PfOPRT will, likewise, clarify the heterotetrameric reaction mechanism which could lead to the development of important antimalarial drugs.
