Received 27 April 1992 The 3D structure of apo-azurin from P~'eudomonas aeruginosa has been determined at 1,85 A resolution. The crystal structure is composed of two different molecular forms ofapo.azurin arranged as hetero-dimers in the tetramer of the asymmetric unit, Form I closely resembles the holo-protein lacking copper. Forn'l 2 shows differences in the metal binding site region induced by the incorporation of a solvent molecule into this site, The positions o f the copper ligands His 4c' and His ~7 are shifted by 0.6 A and 1.6 A. The His t ,7 side chain adopts a position at the ~urfac..~ of the protein, thereby facilitating access to the copper site, The presence of two different molecular form~ of apo-azurin in the crystal lattice may reflect an equilibrium between the two forms in solution, tH.NMR spectra ,of apo.azurin recorded as a rune|ion of pH show that at high pH the line broadening of His '~, His~ and His t t~ resonances is consistent with an intcrconversion between forms I and 2. At low pH, no broadening is observed, This may indicate that here the inter¢onversion is fast on the NMR timeseale. Azurini Apo-protcin; Copper; Metal incorporation; Conformational change

1. INTRODUCTION The bacterial electron transport azurin (M~ 14,000) is a very specific macromolecular ligand for copper ions. The incorporation of Cu(11) confers on it its characteristic blue colour and high redox potential [1]. Although various metals can bind to apo.azurin [2,3], copper is taken up much more rapidly than Mn(lI), Co(II), Ni(lI) [2] and Zn(lI) [4]. Azurin is synthesized as a precursor of higher molecular weight having an additional N-terminal signal peptide of 19 amino acids [5,6] which probably serves to translocate the protein across the periplasmic membrane. Upon transport into the periplasm the preprotein is presumably processed to yield apo-azurin which subsequently takes up copper. Copper uptake by apo-azurin has been the subject of kinetic analyses [7,8]. It has been proposed that the mechanism involves a fast complexation .~tep which is followed by a slow rearrangement of the intermediate to form the holo-protein. Here we report the 3D structure of apo-azurin and discuss its implications for the metal-binding mechanism.

2. EXPERIMENTAL
2, I, Preparation o.f apo.a:urin Recombinant PseudomtJnas aeruginosu azurin was isolated and purified as deser;.N~d previotlsly [9], Apo.azurin was prepared in solution by reduction ofoxidized holoa~,arin with 0.1 M ascorbate followed by dialysis al~ainst 0.1 M thiourea in 0,25 M NaCI. 0.1 M acetate (pH 5) under a nitrogen atmosphere according to [71. The absence of residual copper was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy, the absorbance of the Sy.Cu(ll) charge transfer band at 628 nm was <0,01 (<1.5% Cu(ll)). Crystal~ were obtained by vapour dilTusion from a solution of 10 mg/ml protein in 2.0 M ammonium sulphate, 0.3 M lithium nitrate equilibrated with a reservoir containing 3.2 M ammonium sulphate, 0.5 M lithium nitrate buffered with 0.1 l,d acetate at pH 5.5. 2,2. Unit cell parameter.~' Apo-azarin crystals are isomorphous to holo-azurin obtain'~l under the same crystallization conditions. However. the cell dimensions (a=57.09 A, b=81.10 A, e=110.97 A, space group P2t2t21) differ slightly from those of Cu(ll)-a:'urin crystals (a=5"L65 A, b=80.93 A, c=110.17 A), the maximal deviations being about I% for the a and c axes [ 10]. The asymmetric unit is composed of four molecules ofazurln (VM=2.3 A?/Da). 2.3.

significantly different positions compared to the holoprotein. Under crystallisation conditions, one monomer of form i and one of form 2 combine to form a 'heterodimer', the individual azurin molecules interacting via their hydrophobie patches as observed for holo-azurin [15]. The subunits A and C (B and D) of the heterodimers are related by a rotation of 176 ° and a translation of 1 A causing inequivalence. The two "heterodimers' A-C and D-B are related by a nearly exact local twofold axis and constitute the asymmetric unit of apoazurin crystals. The tetramer thus has C., symmetry. 3.1.1. Apo-azurin form i A superposition of" holo-azurin with form i of apoazurin (monomers B and C) yields an overall rms. deviation of 0.2 ,~, for C~ atoms, no significant deviations are found for the entire molecule. The distance between the N6 atoms of copper ligands His 4" and H i s t17 is reduced slightly to 3.15 A in the apo-protein {3.25 A in the Cu(ll)-azurin) probably induced by protonation of His 1~7 N6 (pK,, (apo) 7.6; 19]) and the formation of a hydrogen bond between the two imidazoles (Fig. 2). The 2Fo-Fc electron density map shows no peaks in the region of the copper atom position. Some weak positive residual electron density is found, however, in the Fo-Fc map, which indicates that copper is not removed completely by the described procedure. As estimated from the peak height the copper content is less than 5%, as anticipated from the UV/Vis spectroeopic data. 3,1.2.

3. RESULTS 3.1. Strttcttu'e oj'apo-a-to'ht The analysis of the cryslal structure of apo-azurin reveals that there are two forms of the metal free protein present in the crystal differing mainly in the conformation of the side chains of copper ligands His 4¢' and H i s ttT, One form is superimposable on the copper containing protein with only minimal shifts of positions of ligand atoms towards the cavity lbrmed upon copper removal. The other form contains a water molecule in place of the copper atom in the azurin metal binding site whose presence forces the histidine side chains to adopt

chains have shifted significantly (0,6 ,~ for His 4¢' and 1.6 A for His ~;) away from the pe.'.d~ in the density map increasing the distance o f their Nd atoms to the peak centre to about 2.7 A each. We inte,'pret this finding by the presence of a water molecule in place o f the copper a t o m in the protein interior. This necessitates the movemerit o f the imidazole groups in order to form hydrogen bonds with the incorporated water molecule (Fig. 4). T h e water molecule is in hydrogen bonding distance not only to the His Nd; a t o m s but also to Gly 4~ O (2.7 A) and Cys ~j: $7 (3.6 A) which are ligands to the copper in the holo-protein. In holo-azurin, the His 117 side chain is located at the b o t t o m o f a surface depression the rim o f wiaic?, is built up by the hydrophobic residues Met ~~, Met ~, Phe t~, Pro Ils and Gly ~j¢' [15,17]. The His 117 N e atom is hydro-

gen bonded to another water molecule which fills up part of the surface depression. In the apo-azurin form 2, the His jj7 side chain is moved by i.6 A across the depression and is placed right next to the hydrophobic residues. The surface water molecule b6und to the His t t7 Ns follows this movement. The large shift o f His ~'7 is accompanied by shifts o f the adjacent residues Phe tl~. Pro tt' and Gly tit' (average atomic rms. deviation 0.6 A) as well as a conformational change of the side chain o f the nearby residue Met ~s. The l-its 4~' side chain is bent by 0.6 A (movement o f C0t 0.3 ,/~) toward the protein interior triggering some rearrangement o f its surrounding peptide structure (residues 8 to 10). The remainder o f the azurin molecule is unperturbed.

Fig. 4. Superposition ofapo-azurin form 2 (monomer D, thick lines) on Cu(ll) azurin (thin lines). Differences between the two structures are centred at l-lis4~ and His j iv, The side chain of His =~7 is shlrtcd by 1.6 fit toward the protein surface without changing the orientation of the imidazole ring. The surface water molecule bou,ad to His =~7 Ne shifts accordingly. Movement o f Met ~ and Phe t ~a side chaiqs provides the space necessary for the His ~7 swinging motion, The His 4~ side chain is moved in the opposite direction (0,6 A). This shift results in a slight positional adjustment (0.4 A) of the adjacent main chain of residues 8 to 10.

3.2. ~H-NMR spectra of ttpo.az,rin To test For the existence of the two Forms of apoazurin in solution ~H-NMR spectroscopy was employed. Since the rate of the interconversion of the two molecular Forms might be dependent on [H +] this study was done using different pH values of the buffer medium. In Fig. 5 the downfield region of the ~H-NMR spectrum of apo-azurin is shown as a Function of pH. Indicated are the resonances that have been assigned to the ligand His 46C,52, His ~~7C~2 and Csl protons and to the His ~5 Csl, Hiss~ C,52 and Cel protons [9]. Whereas the His ~'~Cd;2 and C61 proton resonances are equally sharp at low (4.5) and high (9.5) pH, broadening is observed For the His 3s and His Ij7 C~I resonances at high pH relative to low pH. This broadening is not due to exchange between a protonated and an unprotonated species, because the pK~'s of" His "~5and His t t7 in apo-azurin are 6.5 and 7.6 and thus well below 9.5 [9]. Additionally, the ligand Met TM Celia resonance (present in the upficld region of the spectrum which is not shown here) broadens at high pH. Finally, while the His 4~ C~2 proton resonance is detected at low pH, it disappears with increasing pH. This can be due to broadening and/or overlap. In the spectrum of reduced holo-azurin (not shown) no such broadening of the His ~~ C e l H and the Met ~:j Cell3 resonances is observed, and the His ~6 C,~2H resonance is normally observed at low and high pH [9]. Observation of tt:e C,~2H and C e l H resonances of His 1t7 (which does not titrate in the holo-protein) is precluded by overlap. 122

4. DISCUSSION The presence of two different apo-azurin species in the crystal lattice suggests that there is an equilibrium between the different forms in solution. The crystallisation process can then be described as a co-crystallisation of those two Forms. The preference for the constitution of 'hetero-dimers' packed in a unique, highly ordered Fashion in the crystal lattice, rather than for an arbitrary packing resulting in cyrstalline disorder, suggests that dimer formation takes place prior to nucleation under the given crystallization conditions. Modelling of a 'homo-dimer' of moler.ular form 2 of apo-azurin on a graphics display shows that the favourable dimer contact, mediated by two water molecules bound to the Hisl ~7Ne atoms of each monomer, is strongly perturbed by the changed position o£ His ~~ and the water molecules in both monomers. As judged from the number and intimacy of contacts between the monomers, in the 'hetero-dimer' this contact is even improved over the one found in holo-protein cyrstals. The ordered arrangement of the tetramer in the crystal is a consequence of its C~ symmetry [15]. lnterconversion of one conformer into the other is achieved by incorporation/removal of one water molecule into the copper binding site. The mechanism of this process may be akin to the mechanism of copper incorporation into apo-azurin. In the related protein plastocyanin, the structure of the apo-protein suggested the involvement of a 180° rotation of the solvent exposed imidazole ring of His ~T about the Cfl - C7 bond (a 'revolving door') to facilitate

access to the copper binding site. Otherwise the structure closely resembles that of the hole-protein [18]. In the structure of apo-azurin from Alcaligenes denitrificans, the removal of the metal causes no change in the ligand positions [19]. By analogy to plastocyanin, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa apo-azurin we suggest a 'swinging doer' mechanism of metal incorporation. In azurin, His t ~7is buried much deeper in the protein interior compared to the analogous His a7 in plastocyanin. Thus, it can not inverse the orientation o f its imidazole ring because o f steric hindrance by the neighbouring side chains Phe TM and Met ~3. In fact, in ape-

azurin forms 1 and 2, the orientation of the imidazole is conversed as judged by the presence of the water molecule bound to the His 117Ns. Instead, as can be seen in Fig. 4, access to the azurin copper binding site is provided by the motion of the His ~l~ side chain hinged at the main chain segment 116 to l lfl. At the point of maximal displacement of His ~t7 from the position it occupies in holo-azurin, a copper ion may bind to the imidazole ring and be carried into th,~ protein interior by a closing motion. Kinetic studies of the reconstitution o f holo-azurin from Cu(ll) and the ape-protein have been performed in weakly [8] and strongly [7] complexing media. Both analyses yielded reaction schemes that involved a fast pH-dependent complexation step leading to at least one intermediate which then slowly rearranges to form native azurin, again in a pH-dependent manner. On the basis of the 3D structure of the ape-protein, the pH dependence of the complexation step is consistent with deprotonation of the His m Ng. The slow rearrangement is identified with the motion of the His 117 which might be dependent upon Cys ~z ~r His"~ depro123

tonation or both. F r o m the structural data available no definite conclusions about the nature o f the putative intermediates can be drawn, In form ! o f apo-azurin, only one o f the histidines should be protonated (pH o f crystallization 5.5), since a favourable geometry for the formation o f a hydrogen bond between the N~ atoms is found (distance N~...N8 3.15 ,~,, angle N ~ - H . . , N 6 130°). In form 2, protonation o f two or three residues (His '~', His I17 and Cys ~-') is compatible with a possible hydrogen bonding pattern involving the intercalated water molecule. The proposed interconversion between form 1 and 2 o f apo-azurin has several aspects in c o m m o n with the situation encountered in reduced amicyanin and plastocyanin. In these proteins, the p r o t o n a t i o n o f the histidine ligand which is the equivalent o f His t z7 in azurin is coupled to a conformational change o f this residue. Protonation and subsequent rotation o f the His s7 in plastocyanin has been followed by X-ray crystallography [20]. The conformational change o f the His '~ in amicyanin was reflected in the broadening o f its Cel H resonance in the proton N M R spectrum at low pH [21]. Inspection of the apo-azurin one-dimensiomal proton N M R spectra at a pH below that o f the erystallisation ( p H 5.5) did not reveal the presence o f two forms ira solution. N o broadening of the His ~~7C~I H is ob.~erved, Moreover, this resonance has normal intensity corresponding to approximately one proton. This means that at low pH under N M R conditions the equilibrium between forms I and 2 is shifted quantitatively to one side or the interconversion between them is fast on the N M R timescale, This latter interpretation is supported by the fact that at high pH (i,e. above the His ttv pK~) the broadening of several resonances indicates an exchange process involving His ~5, His ~17 and Met ~'~ and probably also His ~c' which we tentatively interpret as the intercon. version between form I and 2 o f apo-azurin. A surprising result of this study is the apparent flexibility o f the binding site region in apo-azurin, At first sight, this seems to be in contradiction to the widely held view that the irregular coordination geometry of the metal in the blue copper proteins is imposed on the copper by the polypeptide structure [22,23]. it is conceivable, however, that the different apo-azurin forms seen in this study represent the two rigid eonformational

states characteristic for the protein structures belbre (form 2) and after (form 1) metal incorporation.
