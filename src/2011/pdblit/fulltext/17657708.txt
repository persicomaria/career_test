ABSTRACT:
The C-terminally amidated CRF antagonist astressin binds to CRF-R1 or CRF-R2 receptors with low nanomolar affinity while the corresponding astressin-acid has >100 times less affinity. To understand the role of the amide group in binding, the conformations of astressin-amide and astressin-acid were studied in DMSO using NMR techniques. The 3D NMR structures show that the backbones of both analogs prefer an ahelical conformation, with a small kink around Gln26. However, astressin-amide has a well-defined helical structure from Leu27 to Ile41 and a conformation very similar to the bioactive conformation reported by our group (Grace et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2007, 104, 4858­4863). In contrast, astressin-acid has an irregular helical conformation from Arg35 onward, including a rearrangement of the side chains in that region. This structural difference highlights the crucial role of the C-terminal amidation for stabilization of astressin's

large number of preclinical and clinical studies reported so far support the hypothesis that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a 41-amino acid polypeptide,1,2 accounts for a wide range of stressrelated disorders such as anxiety, depression, eating disorders, gastrointestinal maladies, irritable bowel syndrome, and postoperative stress.3­5 It belongs to the CRF peptide family, whose members are mammalian CRF and the CRF-like urocortins (Ucn),6 the fish peptide urotensin I,7 and the frog skin peptide sauvagine (Svg).8 CRF and CRFlike peptides act at the nanomolar level by binding to the GProtein-Coupled receptors of family B1. Two distinct subtypes of CRF receptors, designated CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, along with a number of spliced variants have been cloned,9,10 which account in part for the various functional roles of CRF ligands by exhibiting markedly different ligand specificities.11 Because of the variety of pathological conditions induced by CRF, CRF-like peptides have been studied extensively, and many potent peptide agonists and antagonists and nonpeptide antagonists have been used as drug candidates and to elucidate CRF-mediated physiology. From a structural perspective, circular dichroism studies have shown that the conformation

of human CRF depends on the solvent.12 The NMR structure of CRF showed that it does not have any structure in water.13 However, under structure-inducing conditions, either in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) or membrane-mimicking lipids, CRF prefers an a-helical conformation. Generally, a helical conformation is reported for most of the ligands binding to family B1 GPCRs, suggesting that a helical ligand is essential for receptor interaction (CRF,14 parathyroid hormone,15,16 calcitonin,17 glucagon,18 growth hormone releasing factor19). Furthermore, N-terminal truncations or modifications of the peptide ligands convert some from agonists to antagonists20­25 and C-terminal truncations in some ligands have been shown to result in a dramatic decrease in receptor binding affinities.1,26 It has also been demonstrated that CRF with the C-terminal free acid has less than 0.1% of the potency of the amidated native form of CRF, indicating the involvement of the amide group in receptor binding.27 Similar results have also been reported for rat urocortin 1, with the C-terminal free acid form showing dramatic loss in binding to the full length receptor and no binding to the first extracellular domain (ECD1) of both CRF-R1 and CRF-R2a.28 The human CRF-based analog astressin, cyclo (30­ 33)[DPhe12, Nle21,38, Glu30, Lys33]hCRF(12­41) first reported by Gulyas et al.,29 is a well-known potent CRF antagonist. The high affinity of astressin was suggested to be due to the stabilization of the a-helical conformation by lactamization of the side chains of Glu30 and Lys33. Here, we present the NMR structures of astressin with amidated and free acid C-termini in the solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). In this solvent, astressin prefers to be in an a-helical conformation with a kink in the middle resulting in two helical segments for the Nand C-termini. The 3D structure also shows that astressin in DMSO has a conformation that is very similar to the conformation when it is bound to the ECD1 of CRF-R2b.30 In contrast, astressin-OH has an irregular C-terminal helix. Correlating the 3D structure of astressin with Ala scan binding data reported on ovine CRF27 identifies the entire hydrophobic face of the ligand to be involved in binding with the receptor.

nectivities are identified from the NOESY34­36 spectrum. The proton chemical shifts observed are given in Table I. The chemical shifts observed for the majority of the protons in astressin and astressin-OH were identical, except for the backbone NH and aH protons of residues Glu39, Ile40, and Ile41, which are shown in bold in Table I. The aH chemical shifts are indicative of the local secondary structure elements. The plot of the 1Ha chemical shift difference between observed and the corresponding random coil values is shown in Figure 1A. Continuous upfield-shifted values observed for astressin for the entire sequence, except for the first two Nterminal residues, suggests that a helical conformation is preferred by astressin residues from 15 to 41.37 Residues DPhe12 and Nle21,38 are not shown in the plot, since their random coil chemical shifts are unknown. A similar difference plot (data not shown) is also observed for the aH protons of astressin-OH except for the C-terminal residues Glu39, Ile40, and Ile41, whose chemical shift values are very close to the random coil values. This suggests that the helical content at the C-terminus of astressin-OH is less than that of astressin. Figure 1B shows the characteristic NOEs observed and utilized in the structure calculation of astressin. Strong sequential NH-NH NOEs are observed throughout the sequence, except for the stretch involving Leu15­Arg16, Arg23­Glu30, Leu37­Nle38 residues, which is attributed to degeneracy in the amide proton chemical shifts. Similar missing NOEs can also be seen for some of the sequential aH-NH mediumrange NOEs between E25 and A28, where the aH resonances have degenerate chemical shifts. The medium range aH-NH sequential NOEs along with the aHi-NHi13, aHi-NHi14, and aHi-bHi13 NOEs provide strong evidence for the conformational preference toward a-helix for the majority of the residues. Similar NOEs are also observed for astressin-OH except for the C-terminal region (Figure 1C).

Structure Determination
The observed NOEs and aH chemical shifts suggest that a helical conformation is preferred over the entire length of the peptide for both astressin and astressin-OH. The 3D NMR structures of both the peptides were calculated converting the NOEs assigned manually into upper distance restraints and dihedral angle restraints by the CALIBA and GRIDSEARCH macros in the software package CYANA38 (Table II). Most of the NOEs were assigned unambiguously, and due to severe overlap of aH and NH resonances in the fingerprint region, 5% of the NOEs were assigned ambiguously.

defined structure for the family of 20 conformers with rmsd ° ° of 0.81 A and 1.42 A for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively, over the entire length (12­41) of the peptide. The small target function 0.22 with the minimum number of violations confirms the quality of the structure representing the NOEs. Two a-helical fragments from residues 15­24 and 27­41, with a kink or turn around Gln26, are observed in most of the 20 conformers calculated (Figure 2A). The helices are stabilized by the presence of continuous hydrogen bonds from COi to NHi14 in most of the 20 conformers. Absence of aHi-NHi14 and aHi-bHi13 NOEs in the C-terminus of astressin along with the presence of aHi-NHi12 NOEs and COi-NHi13 hydrogen bonds after residue 38 suggests that a conformational exchange between 310-helix and a-helix is present in this region. Though sequential aHi-NHi12 NOEs

are observed from Leu15 to Arg23 of the N-terminal region, presence of continuous aHi-bHi13 and aHi-NHi14 NOEs suggest that, there is a preference for a-helix in this region over 310-helix. Some of the aHi-NHi14 NOEs could not be assigned in the spectrum due to severe overlap in the resonances (Figure 1). The 3D structure shows that both the Nand C-terminal helices are amphipathic (Figure 4A), with hydrophobic residues (yellow) on the concave (inner) face of the helix and hydrophilic residues (positive in blue and negative in red) on the convex (outer) face of the helix. The first two residues at the N-terminus DPhe12 and His13 are unstructured. In the N-terminal helix, residues Glu17, Glu20, and Glu25 are part of the hydrophilic face and Leu14, Leu15, Val18, Leu19, Nle21, Ala22, Ala24, and Gln26 are part of the hydrophobic face.

NOEs observed (556, Table II) resulted in a well-defined ° ° structure resulting in a rmsd of 0.50 A and 1.14 A for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively, for the family of 20 conformers. The small target function 0.17 with the minimum number of violations confirms the quality of the structure representing the NOEs. Two a-helical fragments from residues 15­24, 27­34, and a small 310-helix from 35 to 38 are observed with a small kink or turn around Gln26 (Figure 2B). The conformation of the N-terminal helix from residues 15 to 24 is very similar to that of astressin, whereas the C-terminal segment from 27 to 41 is structurally different. The a-helices are stabilized by the presence of continuous COi-NHi14 hydrogen bonds (data not shown) observed in most of the 20 conformers calculated. Absence of both the hydrogen bonds and continuous aHi-NHi14, aHi-NHi13, and aHi-bHi13 NOEs from residues 35 to 41 suggest that the helical conformation is missing at the C-terminus beyond Asn34 (Figure 1C). Also, several NOEs are observed between the side chains of Arg35 and Glu39, indicating their close proximity. The 3D NMR structure shows an irregular helical structure around Arg35, favoring the side chains of Arg35 and Glu39 to participate in a salt bridge interaction (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION
Comparison of the C-Terminal Helix of Astressin in Free and Bound Conformation
Most of the amphipathic helical peptides as well as neuropeptides yield much better resolved NMR spectra in organic solvents such as TFE or TFE/water mixture.39,40 The 3D structure of free astressin in DMSO shows two a-helices from 15­24 and 27­41 with a small kink at Gln26 (Figure 2A). A comparison of the structure of free astressin with the bioactive conformation of astressin in complex with the ECD1 of CRF-R2b (Figure 3A), reported recently,30 supports the notion that DMSO promotes the bioactive conformation.41­43 In particular, the entire C-terminal segment of free astressin from Leu27 to Ile41 has been observed to be in an a-helical conformation, which is very similar to the bioactive conformation of astressin when it is bound to the ECD130 (Figure 3). This includes the amphipathic helix, with residues Leu27, Glu30, Ala31, Lys33, Asn34, Arg35, Leu37, Nle38, Ile40, Ile41 and C-terminal NH2 part of the hydrophobic face and Ala28, Gln29, His32, Lys36, and Glu39 part of the hydrophilic face (Figure 3). Most of the residues in the hydrophobic face have been shown to be involved in binding with the ECD130; whereas the residues in the hydrophilic face of the C-terminal helix, namely Gln29, His32, Lys36, Glu39, have been reported to be solvent-exposed in the ECD1-astressin complex.30 In addition to the amphipathic helical conformation important for binding, the amide group at the C-terminus has been shown to be very important for ligand binding. The structure of the complex showed that the C-terminal amide group is involved in two hydrogen bonds, namely, an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of Glu39 and an intermolecular hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Tyr115 of the ECD1. In the structure of free astressin, the intramolecular hydrogen bond is observed between the C-terminal amide group and the backbone carbonyl group of Glu39. Such a hydrogen bond not only stabilizes the helical conformation of astressin but also promotes another intermolecular hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Ile41 of astressin and the amide proton of Val113 of ECD1.30 Free astressin in water was observed to be unstructured,30 even though the lactam bridge connecting the side chains of Glu30 and Lys33 could induce helicity in the C-terminal region. Therefore, we suggest that the solvent DMSO promotes a stable bioactive conformation.

but the C-terminal helix is distorted (Figure 3C) from Arg35 onward. Overlapping N-terminal residues 15­33 of astressin° OH and astressin result in an rmsd of 0.79 A for the back° if all the heavy atoms are included. bone atoms and 1.62 A This suggests that the structures are quite similar between astressin and astressin-OH in the region encompassed by residues 15­33, as shown in Figure 2C. As discussed in the previous section, a-helices are stabilized by the presence of hydrogen bond from the carbonyl of ith residue to the amide protons at i14, which are observed in the entire C-terminal helix of astressin. Hydrogen-bonded amide protons do not show any shift in their chemical shift values upon temperature change. Chemical shift changes for astressin and astressin-OH, however, could not be detected experimentally due to severe overlap in the resonances, when the sample is heated. The absence of the C-terminal amide group disrupts the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Glu39 to the terminal OH group, resulting in destabilization of the helix. The irregular helical backbone conformation observed thereby exposes the side chain of Glu39 to interact with the side chain of Arg35 (Figure 3C). Indeed, several NOEs observed between these two side chains support the presence of a salt bridge involving these residues. The irregular helix also orients several other side chains in the C-terminus (Figure 3C) differently from astressin (Figure 3B). In particular, the C-terminal residues Leu37, Nle38, and Ile41 that are involved in receptor binding,30 on the hydrophobic face of the ligand in astressin are situated differently in astressin-OH (Figure 3C). Hence, the C-terminal helix is structurally distinct from that in astressin-OH. Based on the structural differences observed between astressin and astressin-OH and the involvement of the amide group in hydrogen bonds observed in the structure of the ECD1astressin complex,30 we suggest that the loss of binding of Cterminal carboxylated ligands is partially due to significant loss of helical secondary structure, which is the bioactive conformation. The conformational difference observed in the Cterminal helices of astressin and astressin-OH, which accounts for the loss of binding, is in contrast to the recently reported results on urocortins based on circular dichroism studies.28 In this study, it has been reported that there is no conformational change for urocortin-NH2 and -OH based on the observed ahelical content, which was similar (28% and 24%, respectively) for the peptides. From our current NMR studies, we conclude that the helical content of the ligands is similar because both the ligands have identical conformation for the N- and C-terminal helices up to residue 34. Hence, our studies suggest that the CD data need to be interpreted with caution and cannot account for the local conformational differences in ligands. The observed structural difference can be extended further to

many of the peptides secreted by the hypothalamus with an amidated C-terminus and the amide group has been shown to be crucial for ligand binding.44,45 In contrast, PTH hormone isolated from the thyroid gland has a carboxyl group at the Cterminus unlike the amide group in CRF. The natural lack of the C-terminal NH2 in PTH and other ligands, therefore, requires alternative optimization.

Structure­Activity Relationship (Ala Scan Studies)
Single site-directed Ala substitution studies on ovine CRF have been reported to elucidate the role of each amino acid

side chain in receptor binding and activation.27 These studies showed complete loss of activity when hydrophobic residues DPhe12, Leu14, and Nle38 were replaced by alanine, suggesting that these residues are crucial for receptor-binding.27 Hence, the face of the ligand having these residues, especially Leu14 and Nle38, could be directly interacting with the receptor. In the structure of the ECD1-astressin complex reported recently,30 the C-terminus of astressin was shown to bind to the ECD1 as an a-helix and Nle38 was in the center of the hydrophobic interaction pocket. Other positions which showed loss of activity over a range of 1­60% include His13,

Leu15, Arg16, Val18, Leu19, Nle21, and Arg23 at the N-terminal helix and Leu27, Arg35, and Ile41 in the C-terminal helix. Interestingly, most of these residues are on the hydrophobic face of the ligand (Figure 4B). Most of the Ala replacementanalogs that do not elicit a significant change in the activation of the receptor are in the C-terminal helix, namely, Gln26, Gln29, Glu30, Asn34, Lys36, and Leu37 (0.4­1.5 times the action of the wild type oCRF) (Figure 4B). In addition, enhanced potency (2­5 times) has been reported for analogs where Glu20, Glu25, His32, Lys33, Glu39, and Ile40 were replaced by Ala (Figure 4B). Most of these residues in the structure are part of the hydrophilic face of astressin and are solvent-exposed in the complex with the ECD1 (Figure 3A). The enhancement in activity can be explained as follows: Amino acids such as His and Glu do not prefer to be in a helical conformation, since they have low helical propensities. When such a residue is replaced by Ala, which has high helical propensity, it stabilizes the helix. Overall, these structure­ activity relationship studies suggest that the ligand interacts on its entire hydrophobic face with the receptor. This corroborates the 3D structure of astressin-ECD1 complex in which the C-terminal helix of astressin binds with the hydrophobic face to the ECD1.30 The other structure­activity studies reported on CRF include D-amino acid replacement and a lactam bridge scan. D-amino acids have been shown to destabilize helical structure by introducing a turn or a twist. Single point Damino acid replacement in ovine CRF was not tolerated for the first 11 residues as well as His13, Arg16, Ala31, Asn34 and Leu38.46 The latter residues are also part of the hydrophobic face and therefore highlight their importance and the entire hydrophobic face in binding to the receptor. A lactam bridge scan identified enhancement in binding when introduced from Glu20 to Arg23, in addition to the C-terminal Glu30 to Lys33 that showed maximal enhancement (30-fold increase compared to oCRF).29,47 Both Glu30 and Lys33 are part of the hydrophobic face of the C-terminal helix, and Glu20 and Arg23 are part of the hydrophobic face of the Nterminal helix in the structure. Removing charges in these faces by lactamization promotes hydrophobicity (Figure 4A). Also, introduction of a lactam bridge stabilizes the helical conformation necessary for ligand interaction with the receptor. In particular, the lactam bridge Glu20­Arg23 could be stabilizing the N-terminal helix and the reported enhancement in binding suggests that this region could also be interacting with the receptor in an a-helical conformation. All the single-point site-specific replacement studies along with the structure suggest that astressin may be interacting with the receptor with the residues on its hydrophobic face.

CONCLUSIONS
The 3D NMR structure of astressin has been determined and is found to be having N- and C-terminal a-helices with a kink between them. The conformation of the C-terminal helix of astressin is very similar to the bioactive conformation of astressin bound to ECD1 of CRF-R2. Astressin with free acid C-terminus is also found to be a-helical, but differs from astressin mainly in the conformation of the C-terminal helix. The C-terminal amide group stabilizes the helix in astressin, whereas an irregular helix is observed when the Cterminus is carboxylated. This supports the crucial role of the helical conformation at the C-terminus for ligand-binding of astressin proposed by the analysis of the 3D structure of the complex between astressin and the ECD1 of CRF-R2.

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Sample Preparation and NMR Experiments
Analogs were synthesized by the solid-phase approach either manually or on a CS-Bio synthesizer model CS536.29 NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 2.5 mg of the peptide in 0.5 ml of DMSO-d6. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer operating at proton frequency of 700 MHz. Chemical shifts were measured using DMSO (d 5 2.49 ppm) as an internal standard. The two-dimensional (2D) spectra were acquired at 298 K. Resonance assignments of the various proton resonances have been carried out using total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY),32,33 double-quantum filtered spectroscopy (DQF-COSY),31 and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY).35,36,48 The TOCSY experiments employed the MLEV-17 spin-locking sequence suggested by Davis and Bax,33 applied for a mixing time of 50 or 70 ms. The NOESY experiments were carried out with a mixing time of 100 ms. The TOCSY and NOESY spectra were acquired using 800 complex data points in the x1 dimension and 1024 complex data points in the x2 dimension with t1max 5 47 ms and t2max 5 120 ms and are subsequently zero-filled to 1024 3 2048 before Fourier transformation. The DQF-COSY spectra were acquired with 1024 3 4096 data points and are zero-filled to 2048 3 4096 before Fourier transformation. The TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY spectra were acquired with 16, 16, and 64 scans, respectively, with a relaxation delay of 1 s. The signal from the residual water of the solvent was suppressed using presaturation during the relaxation delay and during the mixing time. The TOCSY and NOESY data were multiplied by 758 shifted sine-function in both dimensions. All spectra were processed using the software PROSA49 and were analyzed using the software X-EASY.50

Structure Determination
The chemical shift assignment of the major conformer (the population of the minor conformer was \10%) was obtained by the standard procedure using DQF-COSY and TOCSY spectra for intraresidual assignment and the NOESY spectrum was used for the sequential assignment.51 The collection of structural restraints was based on the

NOEs assigned manually. Some of the NOEs could not be assigned unambiguously due to severe overlap in the resonances. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained from the intraresidual and sequential NOEs along with the macro GRIDSEARCH in the program CYANA.38 The calibration of NOE intensities versus 1H­1H distance restraints and appropriate pseudo-atom corrections to the nonstereo specifically assigned methylene, methyl, and ring protons were performed using the program CYANA. On an average, 530 NOE constraints and 70 angle constraints are utilized while calculating the conformers (Table II). A total of 100 conformers were initially generated by CYANA, and a bundle containing 20 CYANA conformers with the lowest target function values are utilized for further restrained energy minimization, using the CNS energy minimization package.52 The resulting energy-minimized bundle of 20 conformers was used as a basis for discussing the solution conformations of astressin and astressin-OH. The structures were analyzed using the program PROCHECK53 and viewed in MOLMOL.54 We thank Dr. W. Fisher and W. Low for mass spectrometric analyses, and R. Kaiser and C. Miller for technical assistance in the synthesis and characterization of the peptides. We are indebted to D. Doan for manuscript preparation. J. R. is The Dr. Frederik Paulsen Chair in Neurosciences.
