BODIPY-labeled Soraphen A derivative 4 was synthesized and characterized as an acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) binder. Biophysical measurements indicate that the molecule binds in the biotin carboxylase domain where Soraphen A has been shown to bind. The fluorescent label of the BODIPY can be used to biophysically identify a compound that binds to the Soraphen A site of the biotin carboxylase domain versus the carboxytransferase domain of ACC.

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) catalyzes the transformation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. The enzyme contains two major domains; the biotin carboxylase domain (BC) and the carboxytransferase domain (CT) connected by the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) and is catalytically active as a dimer1 The enzyme has two isoforms: ACC1 is located in intracellular space and ACC2 is located on the surface of mitochondria. Inhibition of one or both ACC isoforms leads to lower intracellular malonyl-CoA levels which has been shown to increase the rate of fatty-acid oxidation and lower the rate of fatty-acid synthesis in cells.2 The resulting shift in fatty-acid metabolism causes a decrease in muscle, liver and adipose tissue triglycerides in animal models. Long term inhibition may lead to a reduction in body fat, hyperinsulemia and an increase in insulin sensitivity. Based on our desire to differentiate small molecule ACC inhibitors based on their binding site and mode of inhibition at the enzyme, we designed a tool compound for biophysical studies by attaching a fluorescent moiety to a known ACC binder, Soraphen A (1).3­5 A useful dye for this purpose is 4,4-difluoro-4-bora3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene, (BODIPY), because of its efficient absorption of ultra-violet radiation and fluorescence emission peaks at 520­650 nM as well as an appropriate profile for fluorescence polarization measurements.6,7 Many BODIPY derivatives are avail-

able and suitable functional groups on the target molecule enable straightforward derivitization.

Scheme 1. Synthesis of BODIPY-labeled Soraphen derivatives 4 and 5.13

Selection of an appropriate point to attach a BODIPY label to Soraphen A was facilitated by crystal structures of Soraphen A bound to the biotin carboxylase domain of ACC (Fig. 1).8­10 The C-16 methoxy group was oriented towards solvent space and away from the surface of the binding pocket; presumably allowing for substitution of a large moiety such as an alkyl chain linked BODIPY and said derivative would bind with adequate efficiency for biophysical studies. The propionic acid BODIPY derivative 2 was selected as the coupling partner for 3, a demethylated analog of Soraphen A.11 The coupling reaction was facilitated by EDC and DMAP and afforded a 53% yield of 4, a BODIPY-labeled Soraphen A analog with 85% purity by NMR (Scheme 1). The major byproduct was regioisomeric acylation product 5, which could be removed by careful chromatography.12 Further purification using supercritical CO2 HPLC with methanol afforded 98% pure material by LC/UV (210 nM­550 nM). The regiochemistry of derivative 4 was confirmed by long range proton­carbon (H-16 to C-25) and proton­proton (H-16 to H-40) NMR correlations (Fig. 2). The regiochemistry of derivative 5 was assigned by comparison of the C-8 proton shift of reference compound 7 (5.05 ppm), synthesized in a similar manner to 5. The BODIPY-Soraphen analog 4 was found to bind to the ACC2 BC domain with an apparent Kd of 3 nM, (Fig. 3). Since the concentration of 4 was kept low (5 nM) the affinity was not measured accurately but is presumed to be less than 5 nM. Moreover, 4

was confirmed to directly bind to the BC domain of the ACC enzyme by causing a 10 °C increase in thermal stability of the protein using a differential scanning calorimetry assay (Fig. 4). An X-ray crystal structure of BODIPY-labeled Soraphen A derivative 4 complexed to human ACC2 BC domain was solved, establishing the similar binding modes of both 4 and Soraphen A (Fig. 5).14,15

main. A known carboxytransferase binder, CP-640186, and a known Soraphen site biotin carboxylase domain binder, Soraphen A, were run in dose titration with 4 (Fig. 6).18 As expected, Soraphen A, but not CP-640186 showed a dose response with 4. In conclusion, we have synthesized BODIPY-labeled Soraphen A derivative 4, which has been shown to bind at the Soraphen A binding site of the biotin carboxylase domain by X-ray crystallography and biophysical methods. The compound binds with high affinity to the enzyme and can be used to identify ACC inhibitors that bind to the Soraphen site of the biotin carboxylase domain.

A structure of human ACC2 complexed with Soraphen A has recently appeared in the literature: Cho, Y. S.; Lee, J. I.; Shin, D.; Kim, H. T.; Cheon, Y. H.; Seo, C. I.; Kim, Y. E.; Hyun, Y. L.; Lee, Y. S.; Sugiyama, K.; Park, S. Y.; Ro, S.; Cho, J. M.; Lee, T. G.; Heo, Y. S. Proteins 2007, 70, 268. 9. (a) Protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol, and then mixed with Soraphen A powder and left overnight at 4 °C. The complex was centrifuged and placed the 1% DMSO on top of the Soraphen A precipitate, and mixed well. The complex was incubated for an hour and the centrifuged to remove the precipitate (un dissolved Soraphen A powder). A sparse-matrix method was employed using Hampton research screens. Crystal screen, Crystal screen2, Peg/ion screen and Cryo screen to identify initial screen at 19 °C. Well diffracting crystals were obtained by conventional hanging drop where 1.5 ll of the protein was equilibrated with 1.5 ll of well buffer, in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.5­8.5, 2.6 M­3.2 M sodium formate. The crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals diffracted to 2.3 Å. Data was collected at in house generator, Raxis IV.; (b) The structures of ACC2BCÁSoraphen A complex was refined to 2.3 Å. The protein crystallized in the C2221 spacegroup, with two molecules per ASU. This structure showed disorder in the same regions as the unliganded structure. The final R factors (Rwork = 0.200, Rfree = 0.242) show excellent agreement between the model and the data. Stereochemical analyses of the structure with PROCHECK (Laskowski, R. A., MacArthur, M. W., Moss, D. S., Thornton, J. M. J. App. Crystallogt. 1993, 26, 283.) and WHATCHECK (Hooft R.W.W., Vriend G., Sander C., Abola E.E. Nature 1996, 381, 272.) show good stereochemistry.

Amino acid residues L238-I760 of the human ACC2 protein was purified from an E.coli strain expressing the protein as an N-terminal His tagged/TEV cleavable fusion. The cell pellet containing the expressed protein was lysed in 50 mM Hepes buffer, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP and 1 mM PMSF at pH 8.0. The soluble fraction was batch bound to a Nickel sepharose resin, washed and eluted with 250 mM imidazole. The fractions containing the BC domain were pooled, digested with TEV protease to remove the His tag and then loaded onto an anion exchange column in the following buffer: 25 mM HEPES, 30 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP and 5% glycerol. The anion exchange column was developed with an NaCl gradient from 30 mM to 500 mM NaCl. The fractions containing the BC domain were pooled, concentrated and loaded onto a preparative sizing column in the following buffer: 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM

(a) This compound was available in milligram quantities from biosynthetic methods see: Boehlendorf, B., Bedorf, N., Hoefle, G., Schummer, D., Sutter, M. Eur. Pat. EP358608.; (b) Boehlendorf, B., Bedorf, N., Hoefle, G., Schummer, D., Sutter, M. Eur. Pat. EP358607. 12. This material was of suitable purity to identify biotin carboxylase binders using biophysical methods. The regioisomeric byproduct was formed in approximately equal amounts to the desired product. 13. Experimental procedure for the synthesis of 4: To a glass vial with screw-cap septa was added desmethyl Soraphen A 3 (10 mg, 0.020 mmol), 2 (5 mg, 0.017 mmol), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N0 -ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (2 mg, 0.010 mmol), 4-di(methylamino)pyridine (2 mg, 0.016 mmol) and methylene chloride (0.20 mL). The septa was sealed, the vial wrapped in aluminum foil, and the resulting orange solution was shaken overnight. Analysis by TLC chromatography showed two product spots (RRT = 0.36 and 0.28 in 50% ethyl acetate/heptanes). Purification by preparative TLC (50% ethyl acetate/heptanes) and collection by methanol and methylene chloride washes of the excised product silica gel region (RRT = 0.36, vide supra) and subsequent rotary evaporation of the filtrate afforded desired product 4 (8 mg, 53% yield, 85% purity by NMR). This material was found to be suitable for use in biophysical assays and could be stored in a refrigerator wrapped in foil with minimal decomposition over one month. Samples of 4 isolated by preparative TLC were further purified by supercritical CO2 chromatography (methanol co-solvent using an ethyl pyridine column) to afford 98% pure material. The regiochemistry of the analog was confirmed by long range proton­carbon (H-16 to C-25) and proton­proton (H-16 to H-40) C-18, NMR correlations.

(a) The labeled Soraphen A compound binds in the same mode as the unlabeled ligand. The label lies outside the main binding pocket where it does not interfere with ligand binding. Although the density is rough for the label, the orientation and position strongly suggests a specific interaction between the fluourine atom, F54, and the guanidinium group of Arg 277.; (b) The protein inhibitor complex was prepared as mentioned in the above hACC2-BC complexed with Soraphen A. Initial screens were performed using Hampton research sparse-matrix as mentioned above. Crystals grew out of a 19 °C vapor diffusion tray with the well buffer, 0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 0.86 M magnesium formate. The assay was run in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM TCEP. ACC2 BC domain was titrated from 330 nM to 50 pM with a fixed concentration (5 nM) of 4 in 96 well 1/2 area non-binding black plates. The FP was read in an Envision plate reader with the FITC FP filter module. ACC2 BC domain was dialyzed overnight into 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM TCEP. Differential scanning calorimetry was run on either protein alone in dialysis buffer with 2% DMSO or 10 lM 4 added in DMSO to 2%. A Microcal capillary VP-DSC was used with a scan rate of 200 °C/h and a buffer trace was subtracted to give the shown traces. (a) Harwood, H. J.; Petras, S. F.; Shelly, L. D., et al J. Biol.
