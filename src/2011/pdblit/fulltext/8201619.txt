Preliminary X-ray Fiber Diffraction Studies of Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Virus, Watermelon strain
Fihcr difYrac+ion patterns have been obtained for cucumber green mot,t le mosaic virus. watermelon strain (a dist,ant relative of tobacco tnosaic virus). and two heavy-at.ont derivatives. These patterns and the similarity between the cucumber and the tohac*co virus offer the potent,ial of a full structure determination of the c~ttcumber virus.

(`ucumber green tnot,t,le mosaic virus, watermelon strain (CGMMV-W) is a member of the tobamovirus group. These are rod-shaped viruses, approximately 3000 LA long and 180 A in diameter, in which identical protein subunits of molecular weight about 17.500 form a helix of pitch 23 is, with 49 subunits in three t,urns. A single, well-ordered strand of RSA follows the basic helix at a radius of 40 x. X-ray fibfar diffraction has been used t,o determine the struc%urr of t#he type member of the group. tobacco mosaic virus (TM\`), a,t, %.9 Lh resolution (Samba & Stubbs, 1985. 1986; St.ubbs et nl.. 1986). In TMV. electrostatic interactions, including the carhoxyl-carboxylate pair Glu50 and are important both in determining t,he .+77, symmetry of the viral aggregate and in cont,rolling the process of assembly. C(:MMV-W has about 40°~,, sequen~~e homology with TMV (Meshi rt al.. 1983), with rnost of the nucleic acid-binding residues ar~tl many of the residues making intersubttnit c~harpe intcrac*tions (sonserved.

Scaled data sets were subtracted, and phases and Bessel order separations taken from TMV (Samba B Stubbs, 1985). An artificial temperature factor of 900 A2 was applied to the data to minimize series termination error. The resulting differencse maps may contain errors because of the structural differences between CGMMV-W and TMV, but the agreement between radii derived from the difference maps and from the equat'ors alone suggests that such errors are negligible. One section of the difference map for lead is shown in Figure 3. Co-ordinates of all the sites are given in Table 1.

calcium- and proton-binding sites will be of particular interest, as these sites in TMV are believed to be important in assembly and disassembly of the virus (Caspar, 1963; Gallagher & Lauffer, 1983a,b; Namba & Stubbs, 1986). The low radius lead site in CGMMV-W appears to correspond to the low radius calcium-binding site of TMV, but Glu50 and Asp77 from the high-radius TMV site are not present in CGMMV-W. There are, however, a number of carboxylic acids in CGMMV-W, in particular Asp42, Glu46. Asp126 and Glu130. that are expected to lie near the high radius lead site, and could form an alternative charge cluster, perhaps mediating viral assembly. Although the four a-helix fold of TMV is almost certainly retained in CGMMV-W, the differences
between the two viruses are probably too great to permit structure determination directly from that of TMV. Molecular replacement in fiber diffraction is more difficult than in crystallography. because it
