central axis, 2 to 5 terminal nucleotides would be unpaired at this point, i.e., they would be melted before the pause and not concomitant with it. We instead favor a model where pausing is conferred by interactions between -exo residues and specific nucleotides in the DNA substrate. The unpaired bases located in the "frayed" segment of ssDNA postulated to exist between the central axis and the enzyme active site represent obvious candidates for such interactions. We speculate that residue Trp24 of the protein, located on helix B lining the central channel and directly facing the catalytic site [residues 22 to 26; (22)], may intercalate between two adjacent guanosine bases in this segment and form a tight ring-stacking interaction. A similar stacking arrangement between DNA bases and aromatic amino acids has been postulated in the mechanism of translocation in helicase (24). The sequence GGCGA contains four purines that may potentiate stacking interactions and is sufficiently short to be entirely in single-stranded form inside the enzyme channel. Clearly, however, additional interactions between the ssDNA and the enzyme would be necessary to confer the observed degree of sequence specificity. A more complete understanding of such interactions awaits enzyme-DNA cross-linking studies or a cocrystal structure of -exo bound to a strong pause sequence, such as the one identified here. We speculate that the propensity of exonuclease to pause at specific sequences may explain a longstanding puzzle about the inhomogeneity of recombination rates in bacteriophage lambda. When lambda recombination occurs in the absence of DNA replication--and is therefore dependent on the lambda Red system, of which -exonuclease is a principal component-- the frequency of recombination is much lower at the left end of lambda than at the right (25). In addition, a strong, nested pause signal containing both GGCG and GGCGA is found within the first nine bases of left lambda cohesive end (cosNL), GGGCGGCGACCT (26). If the pausing of lambda exonuclease induced in vitro by these sites is reflected in its activity in vivo, then the slowing of digestion from the left end of lambda may singly, or in conjunction with lambda terminase (27), be able to account for the recombination deficit. We anticipate that the improved spatiotemporal resolution achieved here, which made possible the nanometer-level identification of sequences, will not only facilitate further work on -exo, but also enable detailed studies of other DNA-based enzymes at the single-molecule level.

A force clamp supplies improved resolution over open-loop systems and makes it unnecessary to apply corrections for the elastic compliance of the DNA-motor complex (12). Force clamps based on stage motion, as opposed to those that steer the optical trap by acousto-optic deflectors (28), are well suited to studying slow-moving, processive enzymes, because they afford a greater operating range ( 10 m) together with high precision ( 2 nm) at the cost of reduced feedback loop closure time ( 0.1 s). 14. The velocity was unchanged by a threefold increase in force from 1 pN (fig. S1A). This insensitivity to external load was observed for several molecules (fig. S1B) and implies that the mechanical translocation step of the reaction cycle is not rate-determining at low loads. A similar finding has been reported for RNA polymerase (8). Force-velocity analysis over a greater range was not possible because tethered complexes failed to support significant loads ( 3 pN) for extended periods ( 30 s). 15. E. N. Trifonov, C.R.C. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 19, 89 (1985). 16. Comparing unaligned data sets, we found no significant correlation between the dwell time histograms for forward and backward directions of digestion (11). A crosscorrelation analysis yielded a correlation coefficient r 0.050 [­ 0.059, 0.159] over the region 605 to 1730 nm, where brackets denote the 95.4% statistical confidence interval determined by a bootstrap resampling analysis. The lack of a single dominant pause in the backward traces prevented us from making a robust backward alignment in that direction. Nevertheless, we attempted an alignment of backward traces, and crosscorrelation between aligned forward and backward records yielded a correlation coefficient of r ­ 0.002 [­ 0.114, 0.110] over the region 595 to 1760 nm. All cross-correlations were computed over a region selected to contain a minimum of seven records in either direction (table S5). 17. The estimated numbers of long pauses ( 5 s) moving forwards and backwards were 49 and 19, respectively (for pauses 10 s, the corresponding numbers were 19 and 2). Estimates of the number of forward pauses were scaled by a factor of 0.62 to correct for the ratio of the total distance traveled moving forwards to backwards by all molecules scored over this region (675 to 1200 nm).

The single-molecule traces were aligned to 900 nm, which corresponds to a peak in the distribution of shifts necessary to align the traces. The average offset was ­2.1 nm. If we aligned the traces so the average offset was 0, then the dominant pause moved to 902.1 nm. In either case, the single-molecule data were within 2 nm of the gel-derived location. R. A.

Salmonella SipA Polymerizes Actin by Stapling Filaments with Nonglobular Protein Arms
Mirjana Lilic,1 Vitold E. Galkin,2 Albina Orlova,2 Margaret S. VanLoock,2 Edward H. Egelman,2 C. Erec Stebbins1*
Like many bacterial pathogens, Salmonella spp. use a type III secretion system to inject virulence proteins into host cells. The Salmonella invasion protein A (SipA) binds host actin, enhances its polymerization near adherent extracellular bacteria, and contributes to cytoskeletal rearrangements that internalize the pathogen. By combining x-ray crystallography of SipA with electron microscopy and image analysis of SipA-actin filaments, we show that SipA functions as a "molecular staple," in which a globular domain and two nonglobular "arms" mechanically stabilize the filament by tethering actin subunits in opposing strands. Deletion analysis of the tethering arms provides strong support for this model. Salmonella spp. cause more than one billion new human infections each year that lead to more than three million deaths (1); they are classified as biodefense food and water safety threats, having been used in a documented biological attack (2). They use a protein se-

cretion system, called "type III" or "contact dependent," to translocate virulence factors into host cells that modulate eukaryotic biochemical processes (3, 4). Salmonella spp. have a diverse repertoire of such factors, many of which target the host actin cytoskeleton (5). The SipA protein of Salmonella (also called SspA) is an important virulence factor (6, 7 ) that binds to actin (8, 9), reduces the critical concentration for the formation of F-actin (8), polymerizes actin in low salt (10), and stabilizes actin filaments (8, 9), thereby inducing localized and extended membrane ruffles that envelop the bacterium and internalize it. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of S. typhimurium SipA (residues 497 to 669, henceforth SipA497­ 669) was solved by multiwavelength anomalous dispersion techniques and refined to a resolution of 1.8 Å (11). SipA497­ 669 retains actin-binding and polymerization activities and has a three-dimensional structure with no relation to any known actinbinding proteins (12). This domain of SipA folds into a compact, heart-shaped molecule dominated by a helical secondary structure with dimensions of roughly 30 by 40 by 40 Å (Fig. 1A). In the crystal, the protein is ordered only between residues 513 and 657 (with 16 and 12 residues disordered at the N- and C-termini, respectively), and the termini are located at opposite sides of the molecule. The molecular surface of the protein has a large basic patch, which may aid SipA in efficiently orienting its actin-binding sites to the mostly acidic surface of actin (Fig. 1B). The compact nature of this domain of SipA was unexpected, because previous bio1 Laboratory of Structural Microbiology, Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA. 2Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.

Fig. 2. SipA has a globular core with extended arms on actin filaments (16). (A) Image analysis of electron micrographs of filaments formed from G-actin and SipA497­ 669 low-salt mixtures produce electron-density maps that reveal an additional (non-actin) globular mass with extended, nonglobular density. Modeled within the actin density is the F-actin filament (red) generated from actin monomers. The SipA497­ 669 crystal structure (yellow) is modeled into the globular core of the non-actin density. In the enlargement of the SipA density in the maps, the N- and C-termini of the modeled crystal structure are located near the arm density and labeled. The basic patch of SipA (Fig. 1B) is found positioned near an acidic patch at the C-terminus of actin (near residue Glu361).

The SipA497­ 669 crystal structure is modeled into the globular core of the non-actin density, present here with much more extended arm density than that for SipA497­ 669.

physical (13) and electron microscopic (EM) reconstructions (10) of a larger construct (SipA446 ­ 684) had indicated that the molecule was quite extended and tubular in appearance (on the order of 95Å long). SipA446 ­ 684 is

monomeric in solution (13) and does not appear to oligomerize on the filament (10). The crystal structure of SipA497­ 669 reveals that the globular structure has a well-packed hydrophobic core (Fig. 1A) and does not

have any of the hallmarks of proteins that undergo large-scale conformation changes (such as "hinge" regions or temperature factor distributions that might suggest conformational plasticity). Thus, the elongated nature of the previous constructs cannot be explained by polymerization of SipA or by large conformational changes in the molecule (although smaller, localized conformational changes would be consistent with the density observed). To reconcile these observations, we undertook electron microscopic studies of actinSipA497­ 669 complexes (11). These studies revealed that this smaller construct interacts with polymerized actin as a globular structure, with two nonglobular extensions that connect actin protomers on opposite strands (Fig. 2A). These "arms" are located at opposite ends of the globular density and link subdomain four of the nth actin subunit in the filament to subdomain one of subunit n 3 (Fig. 2A). The large globular density is nestled between two adjacent actin protomers (subunits n 2 and n 3). Comparisons between the additional mass bound to F-actin due to SipA497­ 669 and that due to SipA446 ­ 684 reveal that both have a central density into which the globular crystal structure can be positioned (Fig. 2, A and B). The density between the two SipA constructs differs most dramatically in the length of the elongated regions that extend from opposite ends of the globular core (Fig. 2, A and B). When the crystal structure is fit into the globular region of the EM density, the best positioning occurs with the N- and C-termini located proximal to each arm (Fig. 2, A and B). There is an ambiguity about the up-down orientation of the crystal structure within the reconstruction, but all reasonable fits place the disordered regions from the crystallized construct in a perfect position to contribute to the elongated density. The combination of the crystal structure and EM reconstructions of SipA on polymerized actin suggests that the extended nature of the tubular density previously observed with the longer SipA constructs is due to the presence of additional polypeptide in what now appear to be nonglobular extensions from a core, globular domain. This structural data suggests a model in which SipA would function as a kind of "molecular staple" in polymerizing actin, centered on the globular domain for binding actin and positioning the arms, but using the nonglobular extensions to reach out and tether actin molecules on opposing strands (Fig. 2C). To test this model, we examined a series of structure-based deletions of the putative "tethering arms" in actin binding, cosedimentation, and polymerization assays. Seven deletion mutants were created to examine the arm hypothesis (Fig. 3). All were highly soluble and stable recombinant proteins. Consistent with the notion that the nonglobular density corresponds to those regions that link different actin subunits in the filament, the simultaneous deletion of both these regions (SipA512­ 658) significantly impaired the ability of SipA to polymerize G-actin and retard the depolymerization of F-actin (Fig. 3, A to D, F). Deletion of only one arm (or a portion of one arm) allowed for polymerization of G-actin and stabilization of F-actin in some, but not all, constructs (Fig. 3, A to D, F). The arms themselves, as peptides free from the globular domain, were inactive alone or when separately combined together with and without the minimal construct corresponding to a globular, "armless" domain (Fig. 3F). Thus, the covalent attachment of the arms to the globular domain appears crucial to function. In contrast to the loss of function in Gactin polymerization for certain SipA deletions, all the deletion mutants retained the ability to bind to preformed F-actin, whereas glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions or cleaved peptides corresponding to the N- and C-terminal arms alone did not bind F-actin (Fig. 3F). Thus, the globular domain contributes to the binding of F-actin, but it has a

minor contribution to polymerization from the monomeric state. In contrast, the arms are of minor overall importance to binding but contribute to polymerization of monomeric actin when covalently attached to the globular domain. These deletion results appear to segregate SipA function directly along structural lines. The ability of SipA to polymerize monomeric actin is dependent on the extended arms, which bind spatially distant actin molecules, whereas the globular core functions primarily to bind to preexisting filaments, probably because the core is unable to effectively tether molecules in opposing strands. In combination, the core and tethering arms enable SipA to both induce and stabilize the filamentous form of actin. This division of function provides an explanation for the ability of certain "one-armed" constructs to retain some ability to polymerize G-actin, because the core binding with an additional arm tethering may confer enough additional stability to the filament to enhance polymerization. The presence of the "arm" nonglobular density may be expected to create a molecule with an elongated appearance in solution, as is observed by EM (10) in actin complexes with SipA446 ­ 684 and by small-angle x-ray scattering (13). We determined the hydrodynamic radius of various SipA constructs (Fig. 3F) and found not only that the ordered core (as found in the crystals) was globular in solution but also that SipA constructs with additional polypeptide arms were elongated in solution and became increasingly elongated as more arm polypeptide was added (Fig. 3F). As estimated by the frictional coefficient, the larger SipA molecules were as elongated as fibronectin and tenascin (14). To further probe this hypothesis of flexible polypeptides at the N- and C-termini of the molecule, we subjected a larger construct, SipA425­ 684, to limited proteolysis with the relatively nonspecific protease subtilisin (Fig. 3E) (11). The protease cut very effectively until it approached a construct that was ordered in the crystals (SipA513­ 657), producing trimmed constructs that when subcloned and overexpressed were highly soluble, stable, and active to bind F-actin (Fig. 3, E and F). These observations are consistent with a model that proposes a well-folded, protease-resistant globular domain with protease-sensitive polypeptides extending from its termini. Thus, on the basis of our EM, proteolytic digestion, and hydrodynamic radius data, we show that the arm polypeptides that are critical to activity contribute to an elongated appearance in actin-SipA complexes, are associated with proteolytically accessible peptide, and elongate SipA in solution. Because eukaryotic proteins like nebulin are also elongated in tethering actin subunits in the filament, the lack of sequence or structural similarity between SipA and such host molecules indicates that it probably represents another case of convergent evolution in bacterial pathogenesis (10, 15).

R2D2, a Bridge Between the Initiation and Effector Steps of the Drosophila RNAi Pathway
Qinghua Liu,1 Tim A. Rand,1 Savitha Kalidas,2 Fenghe Du,1 Hyun-Eui Kim,1 Dean P. Smith,2 Xiaodong Wang1*
The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is initiated by processing long doublestranded RNA into small interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA-generating enzyme was purified from Drosophila S2 cells and consists of two stoichiometric subunits: Dicer-2 (DCR-2) and a previously unknown protein that we named R2D2. R2D2 is homologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans RNAi protein RDE-4. Association with R2D2 does not affect the enzymatic activity of DCR-2. Rather, the DCR-2/R2D2 complex, but not DCR-2 alone, binds to siRNA and enhances sequence-specific messenger RNA degradation mediated by the RNA-initiated silencing complex (RISC). These results indicate that R2D2 bridges the initiation and effector steps of the Drosophila RNAi pathway by facilitating siRNA passage from Dicer to RISC. RNA interference (RNAi) is a form of posttranscriptional gene silencing whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules trigger the sequence-specific degradation of cognate mRNA (1­3). The biological importance of RNAi is underscored by its wide conservation throughout metazoans and the existence of closely related systems in plants (called cosuppression) and fungi (called quelling) (4). Emerging evidence indicates that the RNAi and related pathways function

in many fundamental biological processes, including antiviral defense, development, and maintenance of genomic stability (4). The Drosophila RNAi pathway consists of initiation and effector steps. First, long dsRNA molecules are cleaved into 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (5­ 8). Secondly, the siRNA is incorporated into a nuclease complex named RNA-initiated silencing complex (RISC) and functions as a guide RNA to direct RISC-mediated sequence-specific mRNA degradation (6, 9 ­11). The endonucleases that process dsRNA have been identified as Dicers, a family of large noncanonical ribonuclease (RNase) III enzymes (5). Although only one Dicer enzyme is found in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans, two, DCR-1 and DCR-2, have
