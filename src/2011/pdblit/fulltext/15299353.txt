Abstract

Introduction

The crystal structures of porcine and human aldehyde reductase, an enzyme implicated in complications of diabetes, have been determined by X-ray diffraction methods. The crystallographic R factor for the refined porcine aldehyde reductase model is 0.19 at 2.8 A resolution. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a local non-crystallographic twofold axis. The human aldehyde reductase model has been refined to an R factor of 0.21 at 2.48 A resolution. The amino-acid sequence of porcine aldehyde reductase revealed a remarkable homology with human aldehyde reductase. The coenzyme-binding site residues are conserved and adopt similar conformations in human and porcine aldehyde reductase apo-enzymes. The tertiary structures of aldhyde reductase and aldose reductase are similar and consist of a fl/a-barrel, with the coenzyme-binding site located at the carboxyterminus end of the strands of the barrel. The crystal structure of porcine and human aldehyde reductase should allow in vitro mutagenesis to elucidate the mechanism of action for this enzyme and facilitate the effective design of specific inhibitors.

Aldehyde reductase (ALR1; EC 1.1.1.2)* is a monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes to their corresponding alcohols (Flynn, 1982). There is considerable pharmacological interest in aldehyde reductase and aldose reductase (ALR2: E.C. 1.1.1.21) as target enzymes for drugs used in the treatment of diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy (Kinoshita & Nishimura, 1988). Based on the metabolism of excess glucose via aldose and aldehyde reductase, the osmotic stress mechanism has been suggested to explain how tissue damage might be caused by glucose in diabetes (Kinoshita, 1974). While this metabolic pathway appears to be virtually dormant under normal physiological conditions, the hyperglycemia-induced increase in the flux of glucose

There are no reported inhibitors of aldehyde reductase. It has been shown by biochemical studies that many aidose reductase inhibitors will also inhibit aldehyde reductase (Srivastava, Petrash, Sadana, Ansari & Partridge, 1982). Unfortunately, undesirable side effects (Spielberg et al., 1991) or lack of efficacy (Srivastava et al., 1982) have prevented clinical use of many of the currently available aldose reductase inhibitors. In order to develop potent and more specific inhibitors for aldose and aldehyde red50 60 70 80 90

results in a correspondingly high rate of sorbitol production and NADPH and NADH consumption by aldose and aldehyde reductase (Gonzalez, Barnett, Aguayo, Chen & Chylack, 1984). This initiates a series of biochemical changes that result in cellular loss of functional integrity (Kinoshita, 1974). Aldose reductase inhibitors are reported to: (1) Delay or prevent the onset of sugar cataracts in diabetic and galactosemic rats (Kador & Kinoshita, 1984). (2) Reverse delayed re-epithelization of denuded corneas in diabetic rats and humans (Kinoshita et al., 1984). (3) Reverse decreased axonal transport and improve nerve conduction velocity in diabetic rats and humans (Tomlinson & Mayer, 1984; Ward, 1985; Boulton, 1986; Ryder, 1986).

OSSAMA EL-KABBANI et al. uctase, attention has been turned to the possibilities of rational drug design based on the threedimensional structures of these two enzymes and their mechanisms of action. A preliminary structure determination of porcine aldose reductase (pALR2) has been reported (EIKabbani et al., 1991), as has the structure of porcine aldose reductase complexed with the coenzyme analog 2'-monophosphoadenosine-5'-diphosphoribose (ADPRP) (Rondeau et al., 1992). The structure of human aldose reductase (hALR2) complexed with N A D P H has been independently reported by two laboratories (Borhani, Harter & Petrash, 1992; Wilson, Bohren, Gabbay & Quiocho, 1992). In this study, we report the first crystallographic threedimensional structures of aldehyde reductase (ALR1) isolated from porcine and human kidney.* The details of the crytallization and preliminary structure determination of porcine aldehyde reductase were reported earlier (EI-Kabbani et al., 1993).
Amino-acid sequence determination

To assist in the refinement of the crystal structure of the enzyme, the cDNA of pig brain aldehyde reductase was cloned and the derived amino-acid sequence determined. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Siaki et al., 1985) using oligonucleotides (Core Facility at Queen's University) specific for human aldehyde reductase but not for aldose reductase was used to amplify a probe from human genomic DNA. The probe was nick translated following manufacturer's protocols (BRL) and used to screen a pig brain cDNA library (Clonetech) following the methods outlined in Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis (1990). One clone selected for sequencing was subcloned into the EcoRI site of p G E M 3 Z f + (Promega). The insert was sequenced on both strands using successive oligonucleotide primers and a dideoxy DNAsequencing kit (Pharmacia) following manufacturer's protocols. Full details of the cloning and sequencing will be published elsewhere.
Data collection

Materials and methods
Pur(h'cation and crystallization

Porcine kidney and human kidney aldehyde reductase were isolated and purified using a modification of the method of Cromlish & Flynn (1983). The two critical modifications to the published method were: (1) Use of a TRIS buffer system instead of sodium phosphate. (2) Inclusion of size-exclusion highperformance liquid chromatography as the final purification step. Monoclinic crystals of the porcine enzyme were grown by vapor diffusion from buffered ammonium sulfate solutions at pH 6.5 (EI-Kabbani et al., 1993). Orthorhombic crystals of human aldehyde reductase were grown at 293 K by vapor diffusion using the hanging-drop method (McPherson, 1985). 18 txl of protein ( 7 m g m l - J), previously dialized against 10 m M PIPES buffer with 2 m M 2-mercaptoethanol and 10 mM/3-octylglucoside, pH 6.2, were mixed with 9 Ixl 20% ammonium sulfate solution in 10 m M PIPES buffer, 2 m M 2mercaptoethanol, 20 m M /3-octylglucoside, pH 6.4. The droplets were vapor equilibrated against 1 ml of 35% ammonium sulfate solution in 50 m M PIPES buffer, 2 m M 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 m M /3-octylglucoside, pH 6.4.

X-ray diffraction data from porcine aldehyde reductase crystals were recorded on a Siemens multiwire area detector and processed by the Xengen program package (Howard et al., 1987). The space group is P21 with a = 56.2, b = 98.1, c = 73.2 A and /3 = 112.5 ~. Final native data for porcine aldehyde reductase had 15830 out of 18032 possible unique reflections with 12090 reflections measured more than once at 2.8/k resolution. The overall ratio of I to o-(/) and the R(sym) on intensities equalled 17.1 and 10.7%, respectively (E1-Kabbani et al., 1993). R(sym) is defined as Y hk~Y~Uli- Jq/~hktNL where i is the mean intensity of the N reflections with intensities/, and common indices h, k and l. Human aldehyde reductase crystals diffract to 2.46/k resolution in C u K a radiation (40kV, 100 mA) generated by a fine-focus rotating anode generator (RU-200, Rigaku) and are stable for more than 100 h in the X-ray beam. The space group is P212121, with a = 82.6, b = 60.0, c = 66.2 A, a =/3 = y = 90.0 °. X-ray diffraction data were recorded from one native crystal by using the procedure described above. The final native data had 11 444 out of 12 473 possible unique reflections with 11235 reflections measured more than once (resolution 2.46 A). The R(sym) is equal to 8.3% and the overall mean ratio of 1 to o'(/) equalled 37.1. The value of V,,, is 2.16 .A, Da-~ and the solvent content is 43%. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE intermolecular vectors were calculated using data between 8 and 4 ]k resolution and the molecular translation distance determined. The rotational and translational parameters were refined until a local minimum in the R factor was found. The starting R factor equalled 0.46 and decreased to 0.37 after 11 cycles of refinement using the 2516 reflections between 8 and 4 A resolution (Fitzgerald, 1988). The refined rotational and translational parameters are: a = 29.05, /3 = 63.93, y = 27.4 °, 6x = 0.1105, ~y = 0.1285, and 6z=0.3465, where a, /3, y are the rotation Euler angles and 8x, 6y, 8z are the translations in fractional coordinates. The initial R factor for the molecular-replacement model equalled 0.36 using 9538 observed reflections out of 11 246 possible unique reflections with a 4.0~r(F) cut-off for data between 6 and 2.48 A resolution. Three cycles of rigid-body refinement (Tronrud, Ten Eyck & Matthews, 1987) decreased the R factor to 0.34. The positions of the missing side chains for porcine and human aldehyde reductase were located from ( 2 F o F~) difference maps calculated after the first round of simulated-annealing refinement and were included in the structure-factor calculations for the following cycles of refinement.
Results and discussion

lar replacement and single isomorphous replacement techniques (E1-Kabbani et al., 1993). Atomic coordinates of porcine aldose reductase and a consensus primary sequence built by using human aldehyde reductase and porcine aldose reductase sequences were used as the starting model for molecularreplacement studies (the primary sequence for pALR1 was not available at this stage). The initial R factor equalled 0.43 at 2.8 A resolution and dropped to 0.40 after rigid-body refinement, where R factor = Y~[Fo-F~[/3~IFo[, E, is the observed and Fc is the calculated structure factor. Side chains of amino-acid residues that were not included in the search model were fitted into the density using the human aldehyde reductase sequence (Bohren, Bullock, Wermuth & Gabbay, 1989) and F R O D O software (Jones, 1978). After one round of model refitting and simulatedannealing refinement using the slow-cooling protocol of the X - P L O R package (Brtinger, Krukowski & Erickson, 1990) followed by 40 energy-minimization steps, the R factor dropped to 0.23 at 8-2.8 A resolution. During this round of refinement, atomic positional coordinates for the crystallographic dimer were constrained by a strict non-crystallographic twofold axis. When a cross-rotation function was calculated from human aldehyde reductase using atomic coordinates of porcine aldehyde reductase as the search model and data between 10 and 4 A resolution with a cut-off radius of 23 A, one major peak 6.5 standard deviations above background was observed. No other peaks > 70% of this peak were found. Maps of

In the first round of simulated-annealing (SA) refinement for porcine aldehyde reductase (pALR1), the monomers were constrained by the position of the non-crystallographic twofold axis. In the second round, except for the loops and residues at the dimer interface which were declared not equivalent, the retinement was restrained by the position of the non-crystallographic txvofold axis. At the end of _ V - P L O R refinement, restrained-parameter leastsquares refinement was carried out by using the program TXT (Tronrud e~" a/.. 1987). The rootmean-square (r.m.s.) shifts of porcine and human aldehyde reductase atomic coordinates at the end of TNT refinement were less than 0.01 A, indicating con\ergence. The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. During the course of the refinement, the crystallographic R lector for porcine aldehyde reductase decreased from 0.40 to 0.19 at 2.8 A resolution using 85% of the data with a 4.0tr(F) cut-off. The average uncertainty in the atomic positions for porcine aldehyde reductase calculated from a or4 pl0t (Read, 1986) using reflections between 6 and 2.8 A resolution is 0.32 A. The starting R factor for human aldehyde reductase using 94% of the data with 4.0or(F) cut-off was 0.34 and equalled 0.21 at 2.48 A resolution after refinement. The quality of the human aldehyde reductase electron-density map after the first round of simulated-annealing refinement revealed that the phases successfully shifted away from the bias of the starting model and allowed for the inclusion of 19 of the missing 20 residues not conserved in porcine and human aldehyde reductase (residue 224 was not located for pALR1 and hALR1 structures). A sample of the human aldehyde reductase electron-density map is shown in Fig. 2. Human

The secondary structures of porcine and human aldehyde reductase are highly homologous to porcine aldose reductase. Out of a total of 325 residues, there are two insertions (between residues 178 and 179) and 11 deletions (residues 1, 65, 298, 306--313) in the primary sequences for porcine aldose reductase and human aldose reductase. All of these residues are present on the surface of the molecules and none are part of the secondary structural components or appear to be involved with the critical residues of the cofactor-binding site for the enzymes. The porcine and human aldehyde reductase models include 96% of the amino-acid side chains. The electron density for parts of loop B is weak, suggesting high flexibility for this segment. In general, density for the loop regions is better for human aldehyde reductase than for porcine aldehyde reductase structure. This may be a result of the relatively higher resolution data and greater ratio of observable to refinable parameters for human aldehyde reductase compared to porcine aldehyde reductase. In porcine and human aldehyde reductase structures, the positions of residues 218-226 from loop B were not determined. Attempts to improve the quality of the electron density in the above-mentioned areas for porcine aldehyde reductase by symmetry-averaging techniques (Furey & Swaminathan, 1990) across the non-crystallographic twofold axis were not successful. Electron density did not exist for the four Cterminal residues of loop C (residues 322-325). As a result, these residues were not located and are not included in the refined models. In human aldose reductase/NADPH structure, upon cofactor binding, loop B rotates by 51 ° around Gly214 and Ser215 (Borhani et al., 1992). This movement allows residues 214-217 to fold over the pyrophosphate and ribose-2'-phosphate portion of NADPH closing off the top of the binding cleft and locking the cofactor in a hydrophobic pocket. In the recombinant human aldose reductase/NADPH structure (Cys300 to Ser mutant) reported by Borhani et al. (1992), only broken electron density was seen for residues 218-230 of loop B and unambiguous tracing of the main chain was not possible for this segment. Wilson et al. (1992) reported loops A and B to possess highest average temperature factors in the human aldose reductase/NADPH structure. A comparison between human aldose reductase/NADPH and porcine aldose reductase/ADPRP models shows that the additional hydrogen bonding between human aldose reductase and the nicotinamide ring of NADPH (missing in ADPRP) results in the movement of the cofactor away from loop B, allowing loop B to move over and lock the cofactor into

865

place. On the other hand, ADPRP is not bound to porcine aldose reductase in the exact conformation that NADPH is bound to human aldose reductase, and hence, the pyrophosphate and ribose 2'-phosphate portion of ADPRP hinders closing of loop B (Borhani et al., 1992; Rondeau et al., 1992; Wilson et al., 1992). The main-chain atoms of one molecule from porcine aldehyde reductase and human aldehyde reductase superimpose on the main-chain atoms of porcine aldose reductase structure (same model used in molecular-replacement search) with root-meansquare differences of 1.58 and 1.50 A, respectively (Fig. 4). In addition, the r.m.s, difference between the main-chain atoms of human aldehyde reductase and the corresponding atoms from porcine aldehyde reductase is 1.04 A (Brfinger et al., 1990). While Ca atoms of the core B-sheet deviate the least among the three structures, C,, atoms that deviate the most ( > I . 0 A ) belong mainly to residues located in regions on the surface of the molecule (two Nterminal residues; helices 6, 8, A, B; loops A, B, C) or belong to a segment with residue insertion or deletion in the primary sequence of porcine aldose reductase (between helix 2 and /3-strand 3, and between helix 5 and/3-strand 6).
Non-crystallographic s y m m e t r y

The overall angle of rotation between the refined atomic coordinates for the two non-crystallographic twofold-related molecules of porcine aldehyde reductase is 179.9 °. The r.m.s, difference between mainchain atoms and between all atoms for the two molecules equals 0.47 and 0.57 ,~, respectively. Intermolecular contacts around the non-crystallographic twofold axis are mainly formed by residues connecting helix 1 with/3-strand 2 and helix 2 with/3-strand 3 of the a / ~ barrel from one molecule and their symmetry-related residues from the second molecule (Fig. 5). A main-chain-main-chain hydrogen bond is present between the NH group of Gly40 from the first molecule and the carbonyl O atom of Thr38 from the second molecule. Side-chain-main-chain hydrogen bonding between the two molecules is present between the side chains of Lys34 and Arg42 of the first molecule, and the carbonyl O atoms of Lys68 and Thr38 from the second molecule. The side chain of Glu62 of one molecule is salt linked to the side chain of Lys68 from its non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecule. The side chain of Arg243 (connecting helix A with helix 7) from one molecule is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain carbonyl O atom of Asp278 (connecting helix B with helix 8) from the second molecule. Except for the salt link between the side chains of Glu62 and Lys68 which occurs in only one direction, all hydrogen-bonding

ALDEHYDE REDUCTASE reductase/NADPH, aldehyde reductase/NADPH/ substrates, and aldehyde reductase/NADPH/inhibitors. N A D P H binds human aldose reductase in an unusual extended conformation across the TIMbarrel with the nicotinamide group located in close proximity with a proposed substrate-binding site (Wilson et al., 1992). The conformation of the bound N A D P H is more similar to that found for F A D than found in other nicotinamide coenzymes (Borhani et 21., 1992). The NADPH-binding site is located at the C-terminal end of the barrel in a large deep elliptical

interactions between the two non-crystallographic symmetry-related molecules obey the non-crystallographic twofold symmetry. The coenzyme-binding site The binding sites of N A D P H and A D P R P for human and porcine aldose reductase, respectively, have been located (Borhani et al., 1992; Rondeau et al., 1992; Wilson et al., 1992). Attempts are currently underway to co-crystallize complexes of aldehyde

cavity bound mainly by the termini of /3-strands. NADPH is held in place by 19 hyrodgen bonds and three salt links (Lys23, Lys263 and Arg269). Wilson et al. (1992) propose that the 4-pro-R hydrogen from the exposed C4 of the nicotinamide of NADPH is transferred to the C atom of the carbonyl group of the substrate and an abstraction of a second H atom from a donor group (possibly Tyr50 or His113) by the negatively charged carbonyl O atom takes place. Sequence comparisons show most of the critical NADPH-binding residues for human aldose reductase (Wilson et al., 1992) are highly conserved in human and porcine aldehyde reductase, and porcine aldose reductase (Table 3). Out of a total of 17 residues that form hydrogen bonds or salts links with NADPH in the human aldose reductase/NADPH structure, residues 265 and 272 do not exhibit sequence identity in human and porcine aldehyde reductase and human and porcine aldose reductase primary structures. Residue 265 is lie in human aldehyde reductase instead of Val, and Glu272 in human and porcine aldose reductase is a Gin in human and porcine aldehyde reductase. A superposition of the proposed NADPH-binding residues for human and porcine aldehyde reductase apo-enzymes is shown in Fig. 6. The main-chain atoms of the proposed cofactorbinding residues from porcine aldehyde reductase superimpose on the corresponding human aldehyde reductase atoms with an r.m.s, difference of 0.35 A. The r.m.s, difference between all atoms of the proposed cofactor-binding residues from porcine aldehyde reductase, and those from human aldehyde reductase is 0.94 ,~, (Brfinger et al., 1990). Atoms that differ most (> 1.0 A) among the two structures belong to the polar side chains of Lys23, Lys263, Arg269 and Gin272 (residue 272 is a Glu in pALR2 and hALR2). In human aldose reductase, loop B rotates by 51 : around Gly214 and Ser215 upon binding of NADPH (Borhani et al., 1992). It is possible that side chains of Lys23, Lys263, Arg269 and Gin272 move to form hydrogen bonds or salt links with NADPH upon its binding to the enzyme. Since the three-dimensional structures of porcine and human aldehyde reductase have been determined without bound cofactor or substrate, it is difficult to

predict the exact interactions of aldehyde reductase with cofactor and substrates. However, it is likely that the majority of the residues involved in binding NADPH for aldose reductase will play a critical role in the NADPH-binding site for aldehyde reductase. It is interesting that the cofactor-binding site residues of aldose reductase are highly conserved when taking into consideration that aldose reductase binds NADPH and NADH (with preference to NADPH), while aldehyde reductase binds only NADPH. The structure of human aldose reductase/NADPH was determined without bound substrate (Borhani et al., 1992; Wilson et al., 1992). Wilson et al. (1992) predict the substrate-binding site may exist in a region with fewer conserved residues compared to the residues forming the cofactor-binding site. In general, aldehyde reductase prefers aromatic aldehydes as substrates (Markus, Raducha & Harris, 1983). It is possible that the differences in the residues forming the substrate-binding pocket for aldose and aldehyde reductase may be responsible for differences in substrate specificities. In order to clarify the mechanism of action of aldehyde reductase, it will be important to determine the structure of the enzyme complexed with cofactor and a substrate analog. Furthermore, based on the threedimensional structure information revealed for aldehyde reductase, collaborative arrangements are currently underway to probe structural and functional domains using site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate the mechanism of action for this enzyme. The structure of aldehyde reductase should be useful in designing specific inhibitors that may be used to alleviate some of the degenerative problems associated with diabetes. Moreover, the high degree of structural homology between aldose and aldehyde reductase may make it possible to design compounds that would inhibit both enzymes by directly binding to their active sites, or may provide insight as to possible non-competitive sites that may be useful targets for drug design.
