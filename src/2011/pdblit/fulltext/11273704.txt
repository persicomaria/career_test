Abstract The conformation of a constrained peptide mimicking the putative first intracellular domain (iLP1) of thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) was determined by 1 H 2D NMR spectroscopy. Through completed assignments of TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY spectra, a NMR structure of the peptide showed a b-turn in residues 56­59 and a short helical structure in the residues 63­66. It suggests that residues 63­66 may be part of the second transmembrane domain (TM), and that Arg60, in an exposed position on the outer surface of the loop, may be involved in signaling through charge contact with Gq protein. The sequence alignment of Lys residue in the same position of other prostanoid receptors mediates different G protein couplings, suggesting that the chemical properties of Arg and Lys may also affect the receptor signaling activity. These hypotheses were supported by mutagenesis studies, in which the mutant of Arg60Leu completely lost activity in increasing intracellular calcium level through Gq coupling, and the mutant of Arg60Lys retained only about 35% signaling activity. The difference between the side chain functions of Lys and Arg in effecting the signaling was discussed. Ó 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Prostanoids, comprising of prostaglandins and thromboxane, are a family of bioactive oxygenated metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids synthesized by vascular smooth muscle and endothelium [4,5]. Prostanoids are formed via the ``cyclooxgenase'' pathway from arachidonic acid. Cellular prostanoid synthesis arises in response to various physiological and pathological stimuli [6]. Prostanoids act as local hormones in the vicinity of their production site to regulate hemostasis and smooth muscle functions, which are mediated by specific plasma membrane receptors. All of the known prostanoid receptors belong to the rhodopsin-type G protein-coupled re-

ceptor (GPCR) superfamily, with seven hydrophobic transmembrane domains (Fig. 1A). The prostanoid receptors bind a ligand molecule on the extracellular side of the membrane and then interact with heterotrimeric G proteins on the intracellular side. The activated G protein subsequently initiates a second messenger system of intracellular signaling. Recombinant protein studies using mutagenesis and chimeric approaches for several receptor/G protein interactions, including muscarinic acetylcholine-Gi, badrenergic-Gs, rhodopsin-Gt, and angiotensin II-Gq, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor-Gs, and dopamine receptor-Gs, have implied that the N- and Cterminal portions of the third intracellular loop and the cytoplasmic tails of the receptors are involved in G protein activation and signal transduction [1,7]. Other studies found that several natural or induced mutations in the first intracellular loops (iLP1) of GPCRs impaired the signal transduction through the G protein coupling [8], which included the Arg60 to

The distance between the termini of the TM1 and TM2 is shown.

Leu natural mutation in the iLP1 of the human TP1 receptor that caused a bleeding disorder in dominantly inherited patients by impairing the receptor coupling to G protein [3]. Little is known about the structural and functional relationship of the coupling mechanism of the receptors with their specific G proteins in structural terms. Our focus is on the structural and functional characterization of the TP receptor. TP receptor was cloned from placenta in 1991 [9,10]. TXA2 binds to the TP receptor and triggers an increase of intracellular calcium. There were two TP isoforms with different C-terminal tails, resulting from alternative splicing where the 15 amino acids of the C-terminal were replaced with 79 amino acids [11,12]. Despite the major difference at the C-terminal tail sequences, the two isoforms of the TP receptors mainly couple to the same G

protein and have the same biological functions [11]. The specific G protein-coupling site of the TP receptor may be localized in other intracellular domains beside the Cterminal segments. This hypothesis is also supported by a current investigation in which no major determinant for G protein (Gq family) binding in the intracellular Cterminal domains of the two isoforms of the TP receptors has been found [13]. These findings led us to further hypothesize that the identified Arg60 in the iLP1 region important to G protein coupling is one of the main regions where the TP receptor comes in contact with the G protein. Due to the difficulty of the crystallization of the mammalian GPCRs with multiple transmembrane domains, X-ray structural information is not yet available for any prostanoid receptors. The only one of the GPCRs with high-resolution crystal structure is rhodopsin [14,15]. The current crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin [15] offers a structure template for the conserved transmembrane domains and segments and residues of other GPCRs. Little structural information can be used for the intracellular loops of the prostanoid receptors, especially for the iLP1 regions because the length and amino acids are different between the bovine rhodopsin and the prostanoid receptors. There are only

six residues comprising the iLP1 in bovine rhodopsin, while 14 residues comprising the iLP1 in the TP receptor were reported [10]. The difference of these primary structures impaired the use of the crystal structure as a model to explain the features of the structure/function relationship for the intracellular domain of the prostanoid receptors. Therefore, structural characterization of the intracellular domains of prostanoid receptors represents a key step in understanding the specificities of the coupling between the receptors and the specific G proteins. Recently, the 3D structure of the second extracellular loop of the TP receptor has been solved by high-resolution 2D NMR technique using a constrained peptide approach by our group [16]. In this paper, the putative human TP iLP1 segment was synthesized in a constrained form. The NMR structure of the TP iLP1 segment was used to guide the TP receptor mutagenesis to confirm the importance of Arg60 in the receptor signaling through Gq protein coupling [17,18]. The results also show the difference between Arg and Lys at this position in effecting the receptor signaling.

the synthesized TP receptor iLP1 peptide is shown in Fig. 1B. Circular dichroism The constrained iLP1 was dissolved in 0.01 M phosphate buffer with 0.1 M NaCl, pH 6.5, at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml, containing 0­50% TFE. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded with a JASCO710 spectrometer, at room temperature, in a 0.5 mm path length cell [16]. NMR sample preparation The HPLC-purified peptide was dissolved in water and lyophilized three times to completely remove TFA and acetonitrile, and then dissolved in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. The sample was lyophilized and re-hydrated at a final concentration of 5 mM in H2 O containing 10% D2 O. NMR experiments

Experimental procedures Material Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). D2 O was obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Andover, MA). Triethylamine, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dithiothreitol, ATP, phosphocreatine (Tris salt), and creatine phosphokinase were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). [c-32 P]GTP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). SQ 29, 548 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). [3 H]SQ29,548 was from Perkin­Elmer Life Sciences. U46619 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Fura-2/AM was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Peptide synthesis A peptide mimicking the human TP receptor iLP1 (residues 1­14) with homocysteine added at both ends of the loop was synthesized using the fluorenyl­methoxycarbonyl­polyamide solid phase method. After cleaving with TFA, the peptide was purified to homogeneity by HPLC on a Vydac C4 reversed phase column with a gradient from 0 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. For the cyclization of the peptide by the formation of a disulfide bond, the purified peptide was dissolved in 1 ml DMSO and then added to H2 O at a final concentration of 0.02 mg/ml. The solution was adjusted to pH 8.5 using triethylamine and stirred overnight at room temperature. The cyclic peptide was then lyophilized and purified by HPLC on the C4 column. The sequence of

Proton NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer. All 2D experiments (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY) were performed under identical conditions (temperature 298 K, pH 5.5, sodium phosphate buffer containing 10% D2 O to provide a lock signal). NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 150 and 250 ms. TOCSY spectra were carried out with MLEV-16 mixing sequence with a total mixing time of 80 ms. All spectra were composed of 2048 complex points in the F2 dimension and 512 real points in the F1 dimension with 32­128 scans per t1 increment. Quadrature detection was achieved in F1 by the TPPI method. The NMR data were processed using Felix2000 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). All FIDs were zero-filled to 2k Â 2k before Fourier transformation and 0° for DQFCOSY, 70° for TOCSY or 90° for NOESY shifted sinebell window function was used in both dimensions. The sequence-specific assignment was obtained using standard methods [19]. Water peak was used as the reference for chemical shifts and was set to 4.7 ppm. Calculation of structures The overall structure of the peptide was determined through the use of the intraresidue and sequential NOEs. The Felix2000 program was used for quantification of the NOE cross-peak volumes and for converting them into upper bounds of the interproton distances. NOE cross-peaks were segmented using a statistical segmentation function and characterized as strong, medium, and weak, corresponding to upper  bound distance range constraints of 2.7, 3.5, and 5.0 A, respectively. Lower bounds between non-bonded atoms

were set to the sum of their van der Waals radii (ap proximately 1.8 A). Pseudoatom corrections were added to interproton distance restraints where necessary [20,21]. Distance geometry calculations were carried out on an SGI workstation using DGII and NMR refinement programs within the Insight II package (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). 310 NOE constraints and torsion angle restraints derived from coupling constants were used for the initial structures calculated from the DGII program. Energy refinement calculations, including restrained minimization/dynamics, were carried out in the best distance geometry structures using the Discover programs within the Insight II package. Molecular modeling of the TP receptor A 3D structural working model for the human TP receptor was constructed using homology modeling within the Insight II program based on the reference of the bovine rhodopsin crystallographic structure [15,16,22]. The transmembrane (TM) domains of human TP receptor (10) were aligned with the corresponding TM domains of the bovine rhodopsin sequence. By copying the coordinates of the structurally conserved TM domains directly from the reference protein, the model of the human TP receptor was first built with seven TM (TMs) (Fig. 1A). Site-directed mutagenesis of the TP receptor pAcSG-TP wild-type cDNA was first subcloned into EcoRI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector. The receptor mutants were then constructed by standard PCR method using the pcDNA3.1(+)-TP as described [23]. The primers, which were complementary to opposite strands of the template, extended during the temperature cycling of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 68 °C for 13 min for a total of 25 cycles with an additional extension cycle of 68 °C for 10 min using Pfu DNA polymerase from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The mutant products were treated with DpnI endonuclease (Stratagene) to digest the parental DNA template and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were then prepared for the expression of the recombinant receptor in COS-7 [23]. Expression of the recombinant TP receptors in COS-7 cells COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose DulbeccoÕs modified EagleÕs medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and antimycotics. The cells placed on 100mm dishes at a density of 1.0 Â 106 were cultured overnight and then transfected with 10 lg purified cDNA of pcDNA3.1(+)/TP wild-type or mutants by the Lipofectamin method following the manufacturerÕs in-

structions (Invitrogen). Approximately 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for activity assays and Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis The transfected COS-7 cells were scraped from the plates into ice-cold PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and collected by centrifugation. After washing three times, the pellet was resuspended in a small volume of the same buffer. The protein was separated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. A band recognized by primary antibodies was visualized with horseradish peroxidase substrate as described previously [24]. Ligand binding assay Ligand binding assay for TP receptor was performed using the method as described previously [24]. The cell pellets of 300 lg in 25 mM Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mM CaCl2 were incubated with 3 nM [3 H]SQ29,548 (30,000 cpm, 30 Ci/mol, Perkin­Elmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of 5 lM unlabeled (cold) SQ29,548 or U46619 in the 0.1-ml reaction volume with vigorous shaking at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction was then terminated by adding 1 ml ice-cold washing buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4). The unbound ligand was filtered through an ice-cold washing buffer presoaked Whatman GF/C glass filter (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) under vacuum. The radioactivity of the TP receptor-bound [3 H]SQ29,548 remained on the glass filter was counted in 4 ml scintillation mixture using a Beckman b counter (Fullerton, CA). Calcium mobilization assay Intracellular calcium signaling was quantified by fluorescence excitation of cells loaded with the fluorescent probe Fura-2/AM [25]. The COS-7 cells were transfected with the cDNA of wild-type or mutated TP receptor (R60L or R60K), collected, and washed with Fura-2 assay buffer (4.2 mM Na2 HPO4 , 24.3 mM NaH2 PO4 , 4.3 mM K2 HPO4 , pH 6.8, 113 mM NaCl, 5 mM D -glucose, 1 mM CaCl2 , and 0.5% BSA). The cells were resuspended at 107 cells/ml in the same buffer and incubated with 10 lM Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 1 h, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000g for 10 min, and washed twice with the Fura-2 assay buffer without Ca2þ . The loaded cells were resuspended at approximately 5 Â 106 cells/ml in Fura-2 assay buffer (without Ca2þ ). Before the experiment, 1 mM Ca2þ was added to the sample. An SLM SPF500C spectrofluorometer was used to examine the Ca2þ signal induced by the TP receptor agonist U46619 using Fura-2 as a fluorescence indicator. The excitation and emission wavelengths were at 340

257

and 510 nm, respectively. The reaction was initiated with the addition of U46619 at a final concentration of 2 lM.

Results Design and synthesis of the peptide mimicking the TP iLP1 The sequence of the TP iLP1 (Fig. 1B) used for our peptide design followed the original cloning report [10]. It is believed that the seven TM domains of the GPCRs adopted a similar conformation. Based on the TM domain model of the human TP receptor created by homology modeling using the X-ray structure of the bovine rhodopsin as a template, the distance of the iLP1 termini connected to the first and second TM domains is  about 9 A (Fig. 1A). A peptide corresponding to the TP iLP1 region with additional homocysteine residues at the N- and C-termini was synthesized and constrained to a similar distance at the termini by a disulfide bond formation using a cyclic procedure as described (Fig. 1B) [16]. After synthesis, the peptide was purified to homogeneity and the correct molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis [26]. CD spectroscopy analysis CD spectroscopy was performed to characterize the general chemical properties and the secondary structures of the peptide. As expected, the constrained iLP1 peptide was water soluble, which confirmed that the segment is an extramembrane domain. For the secondary structural studies, the constrained peptide showed a turn

structure, and a small portion of a helical structure by observation of the spectrum with a small minimum at the 225 nm in the buffer condition (Fig. 2). The minimum was increased by the addition of TFE, which further confirmed the presence of the helical structure in the peptide (Fig. 2). These observations bring up further questions as to what residues of the constrained peptide make up the helical and turn structures, and how the structure affects the conformation of the Arg60 residue important to the G protein coupling. 2D 1 H NMR spectroscopy was used to find the detailed structure/ function relationship. 2D NMR studies of the TP iLP1 To further characterize the structural features of the TP iLP1, high-resolution 1 H 2D NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the solution conformation of the peptide. 1 H 2D NMR spectra of the peptide were recorded in D2 O and H2 O using the same conditions as the CD studies. 1 H NMR assignments were accomplished using the standard sequential assignment technique as described [19]. TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and NOESY spectra were recorded, and the assignment procedures involved the identification of spin systems using the TOCSY [27,28] (Fig. 3A) and DQF-COSY (data not shown) spectra, and the sequential assignment (Fig. 3B) was completed by manual assignment using the NOESY spectra [29]. In addition, each step of the assignment was further double-checked using an autoassignment program following the instructions in the Felix package. The complete proton resonance assignments as described in ÔExperimental proceduresÕ for the constrained TP iLP1 peptide in H2 O are summarized in

Secondary structure analysis The secondary structure of the TP iLP1 peptide was mainly identified by the medium-range NOE connectivities in the NOESY spectra and the strength of the

JNHa coupling constants from the NH-aH cross-peaks in the DQF-COSY spectra (Fig. 5). The presence of a short helical structure at the C-terminal region with residues 11­15 was supported by daNði;iþ2Þ , daNði;iþ3Þ , dabði;iþ3Þ , and daNði;iþ4Þ connectivities [30­32], and weak 3 JNHa coupling constants (Fig. 5) [33,34]. A b-turn structure from residues five to eight was also supported by the presence of the connectivities of daNði;iþ2Þ (Fig. 5). Description of the solution conformation of the TP iLP1peptide From the NOESY spectrum assignment, the short and medium range constraints (Figs. 4 and 5) were mainly used to construct the intraresidue and local conformation. The long distance constraints (Figs. 4

and 5) were used to construct the turn conformation. The exact nature of the structural model of the peptide was deduced by structural calculation using DGII, simulated annealing, and NMR refinement programs in the Insight II software, based on all of the NOE restraints. Satisfactory results were obtained as no large violations in the bond lengths and angles occurred upon the introduction of these NOEs into the calculation. Six of the 50 first-generation structures calculated from the DGII and simulated annealing calculation with the lowest energies and RMSD less  than 3 A are displayed in Fig. 6A, which shows one shape of the conformation. To further refine the structure, energy calculations (minimization/dynamic) were then carried out based on the best distance geometry structures using Discover program within Insight II and 12 structures that were obtained and superimposed as shown in Fig. 6B. The stereo view of the solution structures of the TP iLP1 shows a b-turn from residues five to eight (TP receptor residues 56­ 59), and a short, stable helical structure in the C-terminal segment of the loop from residues 11­14 (TP receptor residues 63­66). The short helix surprisingly matches the hydrophobic nature of the C-terminal residues (Phe­Leu­Thr­Phe, Fig. 1B), suggesting that these residues may belong to the second TM domain. The CD data showing an increase of helical contents in the hydrophobic environment with increasing the concentrations of TFE (Fig. 2) also support the proposal. Even though the membrane topology of the TP receptor was proposed more than decade ago [10], the sequence of the TP iLP1 has not been fully settled. Most of the investigators have used 14 residues including Phe­Leu­Thr­Phe (Fig. 1B) as the sequence of TP iLP1 [35­37]. An exception is a recent

(A) The distance of the TM1 and TM2 of the TP receptor  working model generated based on bovine rhodopsin is 9.0 A and the distance between the termini of the NMR structure of iLP1 (without hCys at  both ends) is 8.27 A. (B) The NMR structure of the iLP1 was connected to the TM1 and TM2 of the TP receptor working model with the common trans peptide bond. Energy minimization was then performed for the connected molecule. The distance between the TM1 and TM2 of the TP re  ceptor model was changed to 9.18 A and the distance between the termini of the NMR structure of iLP1 was changed to 9.67 A.

Configuration of the TP iLP1 conformation in TP Receptor model The distance between the N- and C-termini of the  peptide shown in the NMR structure is 8.27 A (Fig. 6B), thus allowing our structure to fit onto the separation between the first (TM1) and second (TM2) domains showed in the model (Fig. 1) without major modification. The refined NMR structure of the TP iLP1 peptide was used to display the conformation of the working TP receptor model, generated by homology modeling with the template crystallographic structure of bovine rhodopsin as described above. The configuration was

achieved as follows: first, by placing the N- and C-termini of the NMR structure of the iLP1 onto the C- and N-termini of the TM1 and TM2 helices; second, by  matching the 9.0 A distance between the TM1 and TM2  distance between the N- and C-termini; with the 8.27 A third, by forming covalent bonds between the TM domains and the iLP1 with a common trans conformation; fourth, by connecting the C-terminal position of the iLP1 to TM2 by a standard helical conformation and the N-terminal position of the iLP1 to the TM1 with respect to the determined structure of iLP1 (Fig. 7A); fifth, and finally, by subjecting the connected molecule to energy minimization in order to obtain a final

After 1 h incubation, the reaction was stopped and the binding activity of the recombinant TP receptor was measured as described in the experimental procedures section. The binding activity of wild-type receptor was considered as 100% (2100 cpm) [23].

conformation. The corrected configuration was evaluated satisfactory for having no major bond violations and for having minimal conformational change in comparison to the configuration of free iLP1 structures (Fig. 7B). The four C-terminal residues of the putative TP iLP1 segment that might be part of the TM2 domain was also indicated (Fig. 7B). Structural and functional relationship of the iLP1 region and the Arg60 in the iLP1 Natural mutation of Arg60 to Leu resulting in a bleeding disorder through the impairment of the receptor signaling had been reported [3]. It suggests that Gq coupling was blocked because Gq coupled to the increase of intracellular calcium levels leading to mediate the biological function of platelet aggregation. The NMR structure of the iLP1 configured onto the intracellular domain of the TP model shows that the side chain of Arg60 is exposed on the outer surface and pointing outward from the loop. The Arg60 side chain is in a favorable orientation for making contact with another molecule. This observation led us to hypothesize that the positive charge of the Arg60 may play an important role in TP signaling through Gq protein coupling. In addition, the conservation of the basic residues (Arg or Lys) at the corresponding TP Arg60 position in all of prostanoid receptors was identified by sequence alignment (Fig. 8). Instead of Arg, the Lys residue is in the iLP1s of the EP4 and FP receptors, which mediate different signaling than the TP receptor (Fig. 8). It has led us to further hypothesize that the Lys may have

different biological functions than Arg at this position even though both carry positive charges. To test these hypotheses, two recombinant TP receptors with Arg60Leu and Arg60Lys mutations (Fig. 9A) were created by a general PCR approach [23] and overexpressed in COS-7 cells. Similar expression

Intracellular Ca2þ signaling was measured by Fura-2/AM fluorescence in a Fluorescence spectrophotometer as described under Experimental procedures. The Fura-2 assay buffer (A, C, E) was added instead of the U46619 for negative control. The final concentration of U46619 was 2 lM.

Fig. 11. Comparison of the chemical and structural properties of the side chains of Arg and Lys at the residue 60 position on the NMR structural model of the putative TP iLP1. The charge surfaces of the side chains of Arg60 (A) and the mutant of Arg60Lys (B) are displayed.

levels of the mutants and the wild-type receptors were confirmed by Western blot assay (Fig. 9B). The antagonist ([3 H]SQ29,548) binding activities of the mutants are similar to those the wild-type (Fig. 9C). In addition, the receptor agonists, U46619, was able to inhibit the antagonist binding just as the wild-type (Fig. 9C). These results indicate that the Arg60Leu and Arg60Lys mutations do not affect the post-translation modification and membrane folding of the recombinant receptors in general, and the antagonist and agonist binding sites are intact. Thus, the mutants are suitable for evaluating the Arg60 function in signaling for human TP receptor mediated by its agonist. Calcium mobilization assay using Fura 2 was applied to determine the signaling function of the TP mutants. After addition of the receptor agonist, U46619, the increase of the intracellular calcium level was clearly shown by the observation of the increasing fluorescence intensities that resulted from the binding of the calcium to Fura 2 inside the cells, which expressed the wild-type TP receptor (Fig. 10B). In contrast, the Arg60Leu mutant completely failed to increase the intracellular calcium level under the same stimulation condition with U46619, showing a complete loss of activity (Fig. 10D). This loss of activity indicates that the Arg60 residue plays a key role in the TP receptor coupling to Gq, which mediates calcium mobilization. To further test whether the functional side chain of Arg60 is only based on the positive charge or that of positive charge and other chemical and structural properties, the Arg60Lys mutant was evaluated by the signaling assay. The results were particularly interesting because the Arg60Lys

mutant only retained about 35% signaling activity in the calcium assay as compared to the wild-type (Fig. 10F). Because positively charged Lys could partially recover the receptor signaling function through Gq coupling, it is likely that the positive charge is a basic requirement for this receptor signaling through Gq coupling. On the other hand, because Lys could only recover about 35% signaling activity, other chemical and structural properties, such as the pKa, size, conformation, and charge intensity of the side chain of Arg60, could be factors in the signaling function through the Gq coupling. To visualize the difference between the side chain properties of Arg and Lys, a computation-aid mutation of Arg60 to Lys in the iLP1 segment model was compared to the wild-type (Fig. 11). The Arg side chain had a larger charge surface than Lys at the ­NH2 groups, which may have contributed to the higher signaling activity.

Discussion It has been shown that mutations in the intracellular domains impair the signal transduction and cause human diseases [3,39­41] through the loss of function [42,43] or constitutive activation [44,45] of the mutated receptors. To understand the structure/function relationship of the impaired receptor/G protein coupling and why it causes diseases, it is important to gain structural information for the intracellular domains of the GPCRs. The iLP1 of the human cholecystokinin-A receptor is essential for cAMP signaling [46]; the

alternatively spliced type II corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor with modification of the iLP1 region was not well coupled to the G protein [47]; modification of the iLP1 for bovine rhodopsin showed a loss and a reduction of light-dependent transducin activation [2]. The Arg60 to Leu mutation in the iLP1 region of the human TP receptor caused a bleeding disorder by impairing the TP mediated platelet aggregation [3]. 3D structures are not yet available for any prostanoid receptors. The coordinates of the iLP1 of bacteriorhodopsin and bovine rhodopsin cannot be used as a template for homology modeling of TP iLP1 because their sequences are not conserved (Fig. 8B). The structural and functional characterization of the TP iLP1 will provide valuable information for understanding the structure/function relationship of the TP receptor signaling through G protein coupling, along with clues for the other GPCRs. The NMR structural model of the TP iLP1 revealed the turn, the C-terminal helical conformation, and the configuration in the TP receptor model (Fig. 7). These pioneer pieces of structural information for the prostanoid receptor can be used to guide mutagenesis studies and protein design for the TP receptor. The Arg60 residue in the TP iLP1 receptor is highly conserved with Arg or Lys in the other prostanoid receptors (Fig. 8A). This indicates that the positive charge of the Arg or Lys in the iLP1 positions could possibly have a general contact with their specific a-subunits of G proteins in all of the prostanoid receptors. It is known that the intracellular domains of TP receptor couple to different asubunits of G proteins, such as Gq, Gs, Gi, and G12 families [48]. Different residues in the different intracellular loops may contribute to the various G protein couplings. Synthetic peptides have been used as important tools in mimicking functional domains of receptors, including G protein-coupling receptors [49­53]. Peptides corresponding to the C-terminal extramembrane domains of the angiotensin II AT1A receptor [49], natriuretic peptide receptor C [50], testicular follicle stimulating hormone receptor [52], and bovine rhodopsin [54,55] had functional activities indicating that the peptides can adopt the similar structures in the cognate parts of the intact receptors. The synthetic peptides corresponding to the intracellular domains of the M4 subtype muscarinic, cholinergic, and a 2-adrenergic receptors could directly bind to and activate their specific G proteins [56]. More recently, we developed a new concept to improve the mimicking of the loop conformation of the G protein-coupling receptor by a constrained peptide synthesis [16], in which a loop peptide whose termini were constrained to a defined distance is more likely to mimic the native loop structure than the corresponding loop region peptide with unrestricted ends. A cyclic peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop (eLP2, residues 173­193) of the TP receptor has been

made with the N- and C-termini connected by a homocysteine disulfide bond. Through ligand binding and 2D NMR structural studies, the constrained eLP2 peptide could mimic the native eLP2 region of the TP receptor with retention of functional and structural properties [16]. These successful studies supported our use of the constrained peptide to mimic the iLP1 segment of the TP receptor. Recently, the residues important to the G protein coupling in the iLP1 of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor have been carefully studied by comparing series of recombinant receptors with point mutation at that region, and found the cAMP signaling from the receptor to be dependent on the specific residues in the C-terminal position of the iLP1 connected to the TM2 [7]. This finding implied that the surrounding residues of Arg60 in the TP iLP1 might also play a role for interaction with the G protein. The failure to increase intracellular calcium level in our calcium mobilization assay for the mutant of Arg60Leu provided direct evidence that the Arg60 is important to the receptor signaling through Gq coupling because it is known that Gq mediates calcium mobilization. The mutant of Arg60Lys partially recovered the TP receptor signaling with fractional increases of intracellular calcium, thus confirming the hypothesis that the positive charge of the side change of Arg60 is important to signaling. The lack of full recovery of the signaling activity by the Arg60Lys mutant indicates that mutation of Arg60 to Lys could be the controlling factor in the Gq coupling activity for the TP receptor. This valuable single mutation information may be useful to protein engineering studying signaling of the TP receptor and its coupling to other G proteins, such as Gi, Gs, and/or G12 . For example, to determine the relationship between the Gq and Gi coupling in the TP receptor, the Gi coupling activity of the Arg60Lys mutant could be compared to the wild-type receptor activity. The two signaling systems may turn out to be coupled dependently or independently. On the other hand, out of the eight prostanoid receptors, EP4 and FP receptors have a Lys residue at the corresponding position of the TP Arg60 (Fig. 8). Our mutation results of Arg60 to Lys in the TP receptor show a reduction of calcium mobilization activity, which provides an implication for the sensitivity of Lys residues in EP4 and FP during signaling. It is of great interest to see how changing the Lys to Arg in EP4 and FP receptors might alter their signaling activities.
