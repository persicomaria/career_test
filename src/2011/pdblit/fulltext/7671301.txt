Department of Molecular Biology and Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA The zinc finger domain of the Wilms tumor suppressor protein (WT1) contains four canonical Cys2His2 zinc fingers. WT1 binds preferentially to DNA sequences that are closely related to the EGR-1 consensus site. We report the structure determination by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy of the WT1 zinc finger domain in complex with DNA. The X-ray structure was determined for the complex with a cognate 14 base-pair oligonucleotide, and composite X-ray/NMR structures were determined for complexes with both the 14 base-pair and an extended 17 base-pair DNA. This combined approach allowed unambiguous determination of the position of the first zinc finger, which is influenced by lattice contacts in the crystal structure. The crystal structure shows the second, third and fourth zinc finger domains inserted deep into the major groove of the DNA where they make base-specific interactions. The DNA duplex is distorted in the vicinity of the first zinc finger, with a cytidine twisted and tilted out of the base stack to pack against finger 1 and the tip of finger 2. By contrast, the composite X-ray/NMR structures show that finger 1 continues to follow the major groove in the solution complexes. However, the orientation of the helix is non-canonical, and the fingertip and the N terminus of the helix project out of the major groove; as a consequence, the zinc finger side-chains that are commonly involved in base recognition make no contact with the DNA. We conclude that finger 1 helps to anchor WT1 to the DNA by amplifying the binding affinity although it does not contribute significantly to binding specificity. The structures provide molecular level insights into the potential consequences of mutations in zinc fingers 2 and 3 that are associated with Denys-Drash syndrome and nephritic syndrome. The mutations are of two types, and either destabilize the zinc finger structure or replace key base contact residues.

WT1­DNA Complex Structure

Introduction
Wilms tumor (WT) or nephroblastoma is a pediatric kidney cancer that was first described by Max Wilms in 1899.1 It is one of the most frequently occurring solid tumors of childhood, affecting about 1 in 10,000 children, typically between ages two and four years.1 WT serves as a paradigm for understanding the relationship between loss of developmental control and gain of tumorigenic potential.2 In particular, loss of function of tumor suppressor genes has been implicated in the development of WT; the Wilms tumor suppressor gene WT1 on chromosome 11p13 was the second tumor suppressor gene to be cloned after the retinoblastoma gene RB-1. The Wilms tumor suppressor gene encodes a DNA-binding protein containing four Cys2His2 zinc fingers.3,4 The Cys2His2 zinc finger (zf) motif is employed by a diverse array of transcription factors that play an important role in cellular signal transduction. Over 1000 copies of this motif have been identified in vertebrate genomes, making it one of the predominant mediators of sequence-specific protein­DNA interactions. In addition to its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, the Wilms tumor protein also contains a proline/glutamine-rich N terminus, activation and repression domains, nuclear localization signals, and at least two self-association domains.5­8 The cellular expression pattern of WT1 is tissuespecific and also depends on the growth stage of the organism. WT1 is essential for normal urogenital development, and mutations in the WT1 gene have been associated with diseases, such as DenysDrash,9 WAGR,10 and Frasier11 syndromes. A combination of alternative splicing, alternative translation start sites, and RNA editing leads to the expression of at least 24 different isoforms that share four C-terminal zinc fingers and an N-terminal proline/glutamine-rich regulatory region.12,13 Of particular interest are two alternative splice sites at the end of exon 9 that lead to insertion of three amino acids (KTS) after the glycine in the canonical TGEKP linker sequence between zinc fingers 3 and 4.13 This alternative splice site is highly conserved during evolution and is found in all vertebrates. The relative abundance of these splice forms is constant; developmental abnormalities are associated with altered ratios of +KTS and -KTS isoforms.13­15 Mounting evidence indicates that +KTS and -KTS isoforms perform distinct biological functions and differ in their nucleic acid binding properties. The -KTS isoform binds DNA sequence-specifically and appears to function primarily in transcriptional regulation; more than 30 putative target genes have been identified, the majority of which contain the EGR-1 consensus site in their promoters.1,16 The more abundant +KTS splice variant binds RNA, associates preferentially with components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery and appears to function in post-transcriptional regulatory processes.12,13,17,18 NMR che-

mical shift mapping19 and relaxation experiments20 show that insertion of the KTS sequence modulates DNA binding through isoform-specific DNAinduced conformational changes, and leads to increased linker flexibility and loss of DNA binding by zf4, hence providing a molecular basis for the differential affinity of +KTS and -KTS variants for DNA.20 The amino acid sequences of the Wilms tumor zinc fingers are homologous to those of other well-characterized zinc finger domains (Figure 1(a)). The Cys and His ligands are invariant, and the core hydrophobic residues and linker motifs are all highly conserved. The linkers perform a "snap-lock" helix-capping function to stabilize the complexes of these multi-finger proteins with DNA.21 Fingers 2­4 of WT1 are closest in sequence (65% identity) to fingers 1­3 of zif268 (EGR-1); although finger 1 of WT1 contains the canonical zinc finger sequence motif (Ar-X-C-X2-4-C-X3-ArX5-L-X2-H-X3-4-H), it has a lower homology with the other WT1 or Zif268 fingers in the characteristic base recognition motif at the tip of the finger (Figure 1(a)). Initial experiments to identify WT1 binding sites showed that the protein preferentially binds to DNA sequences related to the EGR-1 consensus binding site 5-GCG-(T/G)GG-GCG-3.22,23 Subsequent binding site selection studies have demonstrated that the highest affinity DNA binding site for WT1 has a consensus sequence of 5-GCG-(T/G)GG-GAG-(T/G)(T/G/A)(T/G)3.23­27 The high affinity binding sequence has been identified in the promoters of two WT1responsive genes.16 Sequence-specific DNA recognition is mediated by fingers 2­4. Finger 1 plays only a secondary role in DNA binding; it contributes only modestly to binding affinity and specificity and does not significantly protect the DNA in footprinting experiments.24,25,27,28 Deletion of finger 1 results in only a twofold to fivefold decrease in binding affinity, depending on the nucleic acid sequence.27 A systematic analysis of mutant DNA consensus sequences indicates specific recognition of most base-pairs, with the wild-type sequences showing the highest affinity for WT1­KTS.26 In order to elucidate the structural basis for differences in DNA binding between the threefinger Zif268 and the four-finger WT1 proteins and to obtain insights into the structural basis by which Denys-Drash and other disease-associated mutations affect DNA binding, we determined the structure of the C-terminal zinc finger domain of the WT1­KTS splice form bound to 14 bp and 17 bp DNA oligonucleotides containing the consensus EGR-1 binding site (Figure 1(b)), the binding site found in the majority of target gene promoters. The shorter 14 bp oligonucleotide was previously used in NMR dynamics studies.19 The structure of the complex of zf1-4 with the 14 bp DNA duplex obtained using X-ray crystallography shows that zinc fingers 2­4 make base-specific contacts in the

and a longer 17 bp oligonucleotide. However, this finger appears to interact less extensively with the DNA than zf2-4 and makes no base-specific contacts. The structures provide new insights into sequence-specific recognition of DNA by WT1 and provide a framework for understanding the

Results
Crystal structure of zf1-4 with 14 bp DNA duplex The WT1 zf1-4 (-KTS) protein (residues 318­435, with an N-terminal alanine and excluding the alternative splice sequence KTS between residues 407 and 408) and the 14 bp DNA oligonucleotide representing the EGR-1 consensus site, was originally designed for NMR studies.19 However, during the acquisition and analysis of NMR spectra,

crystals formed in the NMR tube upon storage in the refrigerator. These crystals were suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis and were indexed in hexagonal space group P6122 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the zif268­DNA complex29 as a search model. The zinc atoms were independently located using a multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data set. The Rcryst of the final model is 23.9% and the Rfree is 28.1%. All residues were visible in the final electron density except for N-terminal residues Ala317­Lys320, presumably due to disorder. A representative region of the electron density map is shown in Supplementary Data. In addition, the last two bases of the coding strand were not detectable

The protein backbone is shown as a ribbon and the individual zinc fingers are identified using different colors. The coding strand of the DNA is shown in gold, and the non-coding strand in orange.

in the electron density. Backbone  and  angles are generally well within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The average B-value of the refined structure is 86(±25) Å2 and is in agreement with the experimental Wilson B-value of approximately 117 Å 2 (Table 1). Notably, the refined grouped B-values observed for zf1 are the highest and gradually decrease from zf2 to zf4. Due to the modest resolution of 3.15 Å, individual water molecules bound to the WT1­DNA complex were not included in the refinement. The crystal structure of WT1 zf1-4 in complex with the consensus EGR-1 DNA sequence is illustrated in Figure 2. All four zinc finger domains adopt the canonical  fold, with a small -sheet packed against a helix in a globular structure that is stabilized by zinc coordination involving two cysteine and two histidine residues.30 The bound DNA deviates from B-form, according to the program CURVES,31 in that the major groove is widened to accommodate fingers 2 to 4 of WT1. The RMSD (all backbone atoms) between the DNA structure in the complex and standard B-DNA is 3.1 Å. Major deviations from B-DNA parameters occur in the vicinity of finger 1 of WT1. The last base-pair formed is CYT12-GUA25 (Figure 3). ADE24 of the noncoding strand stacks against GUA25 consistent with the parameters of a B-DNA conformation. Except for the backbone phosphate, no electron density could be traced for the THY13 base of the coding strand,

and neither the base nor the backbone of GUA14 could be detected in the electron density map. CYT23 of the non-coding strand is not compatible with B-form DNA, as it twists and tilts to pack against finger 1, making close hydrophobic contacts with Ala326, Tyr327, and Pro328, and with Tyr353 of finger 2. From this structure, it is clear that the 14 bp DNA duplex is frayed at the end. This conclusion is confirmed by the elevated B-values of the bases CYT23 and ADE24 of the non-coding strand and, in part, for bases THY11 and CYT12 of the coding strand, as well as for the residues of finger 1. The packing of individual WT1­DNA complex units in the crystal lattice is shown in Figure 4. The zf1 fingers from symmetry-related molecules are involved in extensive protein­protein contacts, with hydrophobic interactions between Phe323 of one WT1 molecule and Leu337 of the symmetryrelated molecule (Figure 4(a), area 1), and a contact between CYT23 of one DNA duplex and Met342 and Arg345 of the symmetry-related WT1 molecule. The other end of the DNA is packed tail-totail in the crystal lattice (Figure 4(b)). CYT1-GUA36 is stacked against a CYT1­GUA36 pair of a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal. The distance between these two base-pairs almost exactly matches the stacking distance of B-DNA. Two other crystal contact areas (not shown in Figure 4) primarily involve the finger tips of zinc fingers 3 and 4.

WT1­DNA Complex Structure

Structural analysis of zinc fingers 2­4 in the X-ray structure Zinc fingers 2 to 4 play a critical role in sequencespecific recognition of the DNA. Specificity is realized through a network of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between amino acid side-chains and DNA bases (Figure 5). A schematic diagram showing contacts throughout the complex is shown in Figure 6. At the resolution of the WT1 X-ray structure, details of the hydrogen bonding interactions cannot be discerned. The crystal structure of zif268 bound to the EGR-1 consensus sequence has been determined at 1.6 A resolution.29 The amino acid sequence of WT1 zinc fingers 2­4 is 65% identical to the three zinc fingers of zif268 (Figure 1(a)). All amino acid residues involved in base recognition by WT1 fingers 2, 3, and 4 are identical to those of fingers 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of Zif268 and they occupy similar positions in the major groove, suggesting that similar interactions are involved in recognition of the EGR-1 consensus by both WT1 and Zif268. Base contacts are primarily observed for the purine-rich coding strand, but some interactions are also observed with bases of the noncoding strand. The RMSD between the backbone atoms of zif268 and zinc fingers 2­4 of WT1 is 1.6 Å. Recognition of DNA by WT1 zf2-4 is based on shape, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding complementarity between the binding surface in the major groove and the concave surface formed by fingers 2

The base of ADE24 is stacked on that of GUA25, but CYT23 is rotated out of the DNA double helix. No electron density was observed for GUA14 at the 3 end of the coding strand, and only the phosphate group of THY13 had observable density.

1233 into the major groove (Figure 2). The intermolecular contact surface is extensive, and the WT1 zf1-4 protein buries 1345 Å2 of the DNA surface. The principal base contacts of zf2 are formed between the guanidinium groups of Arg366 and Arg372 and the major groove edges of GUA10 and GUA8, respectively. Additional contacts are made between zf2 and the phosphate backbone; the N1 of the zinc ligand His373 is close to O2 of the phosphodiester moiety between GUA6 and GUA7 and, by analogy with other zinc finger complexes with DNA,32 probably forms a hydrogen bond to it. Ser367 contacts the phosphate backbone of the noncoding strand. The contacts between zf3 and the DNA are mediated through interactions of Arg394 and Asp396 with GUA7 and CYT29, respectively, and His397 contacts the major groove edge of GUA6. The side-chains of Ser393, Lys399, and the zinc ligand His401 are positioned where they potentially form hydrogen bonds to the phosphate backbone. The pattern of base contacts made by zf4

1234 is similar to that of zf2, where the guanidinium groups of Arg424 and Arg430 are positioned close to the edges of GUA4 and GUA2, respectively. Structural analysis of zinc finger 1 in the X-ray structure In the X-ray structure, the first zinc finger (zf1) of WT1 does not bind in the major groove and makes no base-specific contacts with DNA (Figure 2). The main interaction of zf1 with the 14 bp DNA appears to be electrostatic, and involves the positively charged surface formed by the zf1­zf2 linker and C terminus of the zf1 helix. The only DNA contacts with zf1 are formed by the backbone of the non-coding strand and the base of CYT23, which is flipped towards the protein, with concomitant fraying of the DNA duplex (Figure 3). However, as noted above, finger 1 is also involved in extensive crystal packing contacts, which could potentially have distorted the structure of zf1 and contributed to or even caused the fraying of the DNA in the vicinity. We therefore performed additional structural analysis, based on NMR measurements, including residual dipolar couplings and intermolecular nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs), to make an independent assessment of the orientation of zf1 with respect to the major groove and the nature of its interactions with the DNA. NMR spectra of WT1 zf1-4 DNA complexes Previous NMR studies of the WT1 zinc finger-DNA complexes19­21 utilized a 14 bp DNA duplex with a consensus sequence based on that of EGR-1. In order to evaluate the extent to which the DNA­finger 1 interactions may have been affected by crystal packing, we undertook NMR studies on WT1 zf1-4 in complex with a longer 17 bp duplex, which contains three additional GC base-pairs prior to the putative binding site for zf1 (Figure 1(b)). Binding of the longer DNA duplex to 15N enriched WT1 zf1-4 gives an almost identical 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum to that of the complex with the 14 bp DNA duplex (Figure 7(a)), with a few small but significant differences that are clustered in zf1 and in the linker between zf1 and zf2 (Figure 7(b)). The location of these differences suggests that binding of zf1 may differ slightly in complex with the longer DNA duplex, but that the structures of zf2-4 are identical. The observed chemical shift changes are localized to finger 1 residues, which are located close to the extra 3 bp of the longer DNA, as shown by the structure determination (see below). NMR measurements were made to evaluate the structure of zf1-4 in complex with both the 14 bp and 17 bp oligonucleotides. 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDC) were measured, using Pf1 phage33 as the alignment medium. Contacts between the 14 bp DNA and the protein were identified using a 13C-edited-13C-filtered NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum, which unequivocally showed the presence of NOEs between the Met342

methyl group in zf1 and several DNA protons (Figure 8). Additional intermolecular NOEs were observed from the methyl protons of Ala326. The NOEs from these two methyl groups are consistent with the presence of finger 1 in the major groove. NOEs between the Met342 methyl and DNA were also observed in NOESY spectra acquired for the complex of zf1-4 with the 17 bp DNA duplex. Modeling the structure of the WT1 zf1-4 DNA complex from NMR and X-ray data The NMR spectra of the WT1 complexes with the 14 bp and 17 bp oligonucleotides were not of sufficient quality to permit structure analysis from NMR data alone. Since our primary goal was to determine the location of zinc finger 1 in the DNA complexes, we adopted a composite approach to calculate structural models, in which restraints derived from both X-ray and NMR data were used in molecular dynamics simulated annealing (Table 2). The region of DNA associated with fingers 2­4, nucleotides 1­12 and 25­36 (Figure 1(b)), was fixed in the X-ray conformation. The additional base-pairs in the 14-mer and 17-mer oligonucleotides were modeled as canonical B-form DNA. Structures of the individual WT1 zinc fingers were generated using canonical distance restraints derived from the X-ray coordinates, supplemented by backbone  and  dihedral angle restraints obtained from experimental chemical shift data using TALOS.34 The protein was docked onto the DNA using experimental intermolecular distance restraints derived from NOESY spectra for finger 1, and intermolecular distance bounds calculated from the X-ray structure for fingers 2­4. No inter-finger distance restraints were used, thereby allowing flexibility in docking to the DNA. Experimental residual dipolar coupling restraints were used to define the relative orientations of the zinc fingers in the DNA complexes. The composite structures calculated for the complexes of WT1 zf1-4 with the 14 bp and 17 bp duplex DNAs are shown in Figure 9. The helix of finger 1 lies in the major groove but, in contrast to the other fingers, the fingertip points away from the DNA so that the side-chains that are commonly involved in base recognition cannot contact the DNA. While the orientation of the helix within the major groove can be determined with considerable confidence, the position of the -sheet of zf1 is not well defined by the residual dipolar coupling data due to the transverse orientation of the amide bond vectors with respect to the alignment tensor, which nearly matches the long axis of the DNA helix. Crosspeaks in the zf1-4 HSQC spectrum that shift slightly between the 14-mer and 17-mer complexes (Figure 7(b)) arise from amides located in the zf1­ zf2 linker and in regions of zf1 near the additional 3 bp in the longer DNA construct. Linker structures In the X-ray structure of WT1 zf1-4 bound to the 14 bp DNA, all three linkers adopt well-defined

1235 into a pocket formed by Thr387, partly by Thr402, and by His405. Further, Pro382 and Pro410 pack against the tip of the following linker and the adjacent conserved Phe383 and Phe411, respectively. In the X-ray structure, the linker following zf1 shows elevated average B-values as does finger 1 itself, indicating partial disorder in the crystal lattice. Thr348 is involved in crystal contacts with Thr348 from a symmetry-related molecule in place of the stabilizing intramolecular interactions observed for the corresponding residue in the other linkers. zf1 of WT1 is rotated around the  angle of Gly349 by 260° with respect to the conformation of zf2­zf4, which places it near the phosphate backbone rather than in the major groove.

Discussion
Sequence requirements in the consensus DNA The overall structure of fingers 2 to 4 of WT1­KTS bound to the 14 bp DNA duplex closely resembles the conformation found for fingers 1 to 3 of zif268.29,37,38 Three consecutive fingers bind DNA by wrapping around the major groove and make contact with 10 bp. Except for the linker following finger 1, the conserved threonine and glycine residues of the other linkers in the WT1­KTS­DNA complex form backbone and side-chain hydrogen bonds that are exactly analogous to those formed by the corresponding linkers in zif268,29,38 which function to cap the preceding helix and stabilize the linker structure.21 Several side-chains located on the finger tips or helices of zf2, zf3, and zf4 make direct hydrogen bonding contacts with bases on the coding strand (Figures 5 and 6); substitution of any of those bases results in a 10­1000-fold decrease in DNA binding affinity.26 In contrast, some base substitutions are permitted at sites that are not directly contacted by the zinc fingers; cytidine and thymine are allowed at position 3, and both guanine and thymine can be accommodated at base-pair 5 with only minimal effects on affinity. Interestingly, substitution of CYT9 by adenine in the consensus EGR-1 sequence results in fourfold enhancement of binding affinity; 26 in contrast, this same base substitution leads to a 13-fold decrease in binding affinity for Zif268.39 The X-ray structure shows that the side-chain of Gln369 is positioned such that it could potentially form additional hydrogen bonds with the N6 and/or N7 of an adenine at position 9, explaining the higher affinity binding of WT1 to this modified recognition element. The corresponding residue in Zif268, Glu21, has been shown to contribute directly to specificity, displaying a strong preference for cytosine over adenine at this position.39 In marked contrast to fingers 2­4, zf1 in the X-ray crystal structure does not bind in the major groove of the 14 bp DNA, but is involved in extensive crystal contacts with the zf1 domain from a neighboring molecule in the crystal lattice.

conformations and pack against the adjacent fingers, each burying a substantial surface area at the finger­ finger interface. The surface buried at the interface35 between zf1 and zf2 is 225 Å2, between zf2 and zf3 is 229 Å2, and between zf3 and zf4 is 227 Å2. The first and second residues of each linker are integral components of the preceding fingers. Residues Thr348, Thr378 and Thr406 correspond to the C-terminal residues of the -helices of fingers 1, 2 and 3, respectively, and their amide nitrogen atoms are hydrogen-bonded to the backbone carbonyl of the residue immediately following the first histidine ligand (Ser344, Gln374 and Thr402, respectively). The side-chain O of each of these threonine residues hydrogen bonds to the backbone amide of the third residue in the linker, consistent with previous studies.21 The conserved glycine residues, Gly349 following zf1, Gly379 following zf2 and Gly407 following zf3, form L helix-termination motifs36 and appear to play an important role in stabilization of the linker structure.21,36 Hydrophobic packing also appears to contribute to the stabilization of ordered structure in the linkers, as observed for other Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins.32 In particular, Thr378 fits into a small hydrophobic pocket formed by His377 and Phe357 and Thr406 fits

only contacts between zf1 and the DNA involve the flipped out base of CYT23. However, when complexed with both the 14-mer DNA and the longer 17 bp oligonucleotide in solution, the NMR data show clearly that like fingers 2­4, zf1 also lies in the major groove (Figure 9). An overlay of the three structures is shown in Figure 10, demonstrating the similarity of the position of finger 1 in the two solution structures, and the translocated position of finger 1 in the X-ray structure. However, zf1 in the solution structures does not form the typical major groove­zinc finger contacts that are seen for fingers 2­4. The helix of zf1 subtends a different angle to the principal axis of the DNA than the helices in the other zinc fingers (Figure 11). The helix axes of fingers 2­4 are rotated counterclockwise about an axis perpendicular to the principal axis of the DNA, through average angles of -38(±4), -53(±1), and -46(±8) degrees for zf2, zf3, and zf4, respectively, in a family of 15 structures. In contrast, the helix axis of zf1 is rotated clockwise by +36(±11) degrees about the same axis. As a consequence, the N-terminal end of the helix and the fingertip of zf1 project out of the major groove and DNA contacts are limited to residues in the C-terminal region of the helix. The orientations of zf2-4 are typical of zinc finger DNA complexes, with the N terminus of the helix and fingertip deeply buried in the major groove such that side-chains can make intimate contacts with the base edges. In the canonical DNAbinding orientation, the tip of each finger packs against the central region of the helix of the preceding zinc finger; due to its altered orientation, the helix of zf1 is distant from the zf2 fingertip. Although it is clear that the helix of finger 1 lies in the major groove, the paucity of NMR restraints prevents us from discerning details of the protein­

DNA contacts. Nonetheless, T1 and T2 data recorded for WT1 in complex with the 14 and 17 bp oligonucleotides clearly showed that all four zinc fingers are bound to the DNA. The intermolecular NOEs involving Met342 protons place its methyl group near the edge of the major groove, in close proximity to the THY11 ribose. The side-chain of Arg345 is highly disordered (there are no experimental restraints available), but is located in the major groove where it could potentially form direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the bases. The side-chains of Lys346 and Lys 351, near the C terminus of the zf1 helix and in the zf1-2 linker, respectively, have the potential to contact the phosphate backbone and help stabilize the zf1­ DNA interaction. The potential zf1­DNA interactions are summarized in Figure 6. It is important to note that, due to the altered orientation of zf1 in the major groove, the side-chains that typically function in base recognition by Cys2His2 zinc fingers, located at positions -1, 2, 3, and 6 of the helix,29 make no contact with the bases of the 17-mer DNA. The NMR structure is consistent with zinc finger deletion and mutagenesis experiments which show that zf1 contributes very little to the overall binding affinity or to sequence specificity;23,25,26 base substitution at positions 11­13 or even complete deletion of finger 1 results in only a twofold to fivefold reduction in affinity. The weakness of the zf1 interactions explains how the +KTS insert in the zf3-zf4 linker can abrogate DNA binding; since zf1 contributes very little to binding affinity, which is dominated by the zf2-4­DNA interactions, disruption of the linker structure and consequent loss of zf4 interactions20 greatly diminishes the WT1 DNA binding affinity. The observation that an individual zinc finger in a multi-finger protein makes only weak interactions

with DNA is not without precedent. In TFIIIA, fingers 4 and 6 interact only weakly with the DNA;40 these fingers bind across the minor groove and make very few DNA contacts, exclusively to the phosphate backbone.41­43 Similarly, finger 1 of the threezinc finger protein Sp1 displays relaxed sequence specificity and makes a relatively small contribution to the overall binding affinity.44 An extreme example is given by the five-finger protein GLI; the crystal structure of a GLI­DNA complex shows finger 1 folded back onto finger 2 such that it makes no contact at all with the DNA.45 Although fingers 2­5 of GLI all bind in the major groove, all except one of the base contacts are made by side-chains in fingers 4 and 5. It is also of interest to compare the structure of the DNA complex of WT1 with that formed by the fourfinger protein YY1.46 Fingers 2­4 of YY1 bind in the major groove in a very similar orientation to the

corresponding fingers of WT1 (Figure 12). Indeed, the backbone heavy atoms in the two complexes superimpose with a 1.1 Å root-mean-square deviation (excluding the loops between the Cys ligands in fingers 2 and 3, which differ in length in WT1 and YY1). In both the YY1 and WT1 complexes, the helix of finger 1 continues to follow the major groove in a non-canonical manner; the helices are oriented very similarly in the two complexes, with the fingertip projecting out of the major groove. Finger 1 of YY1 forms only a single base contact by way of a lysine side-chain (Lys315) in the middle of the helix, at the position occupied by Met342 in WT1; all other DNA contacts involving finger 1 are to the phosphate backbone.46 Thus in both the WT1 and YY1 complexes, fingers 2­4 bind in a canonical orientation, with the fingertip and N terminus of the helix inserted deeply into the major groove to facilitate base recognition. However, the orientation

three zinc fingers separated by canonical (TGEKP) linkers appear to be optimal for high affinity binding in the major groove. Addition of further zinc fingers connected by canonical linkers adds

little to the binding affinity, either because of strain introduced by a mismatch between the periodicity of the fingers and the DNA or because of entropic effects.47,48 Molecular basis of WT1-associated disease More than 95% of patients with Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) display point mutations in the WT1 zinc finger domain.14 These mutations occur predominantly in fingers 2 and 3, whereas those associated with Wilms tumor formation mostly result in truncation of the protein to eliminate part or all of the zinc finger domain.15,24 The sites of identified point mutations in the zinc finger domain in patients with Denys-Drash syndrome, Wilms tumor, nephritic syndrome, Frasier syndrome, and diffuse mesangial sclerosis are indicated in Figure 1. The point mutations fall into two classes: (1) mutations that destabilize the zinc finger structure; and (2) mutations that replace key base contact residues in zf2 or zf3. The most common class 1 mutation involves substitution of zinc ligands: Cys330Tyr (zf1), Cys355Gly/Tyr (zf2), Cys360Gly/Tyr (zf2), His373Gln/Tyr (zf2), His377Arg/Tyr (zf2), Cys385Arg (zf3), Cys388Arg/Phe/Tyr (zf3), and His401Tyr (zf3). Clearly, each of these mutations would completely disrupt the structure of the affected zinc finger. Other potentially destabilizing mutations substitute proline into the helices (Gln369Pro in helix 2, Leu398Pro in helix 3) or replace key residues in the hydrophobic core (Phe364 http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/ns/1/120496.html

Leu, Phe383Leu). The importance of the correct linker conformation for DNA binding function is underscored by the mutation Gly379Cys, associated with nephrotic syndrome, which replaces the L helix-capping residue in the zf2­zf3 linker. In class 2, common DDS mutations result in substitution of Arg394, which contacts GUA7, by Gln, Leu, Pro, or Trp; all of these mutations would be expected to disrupt the zf3­DNA interactions. Indeed, the mutation Arg394Trp has been shown to abrogate DNA binding.9,24,49 Asp396, which buttresses the Arg394 ­ GUA7 interaction and makes direct contact with CYT29, is also mutated to Gly, Asn, or Tyr in DDS; these mutations also disrupt DNA binding.9,24,49 Finally, a His397Pro substitution associated with nephritic syndrome50 would disrupt contacts with GUA6 and destabilize the helix of zf3. In zf2, DDS mutations result in substitution of Arg366, which contacts GUA10, with Cys, His, or Leu, leading to diminished DNA binding affinity.24 Phosphorylation of WT1 cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Ser365 and Ser393 of WT1 inhibits DNA binding and transcriptional repression activity.51 Our structure provides a molecular explanation for this phenomenon. Ser393 is in direct contact with the DNA sugar phosphate backbone (O2P of GUA6) of the coding strand (Figure 6); phosphorylation would result in steric clash and electrostatic repulsions between the phosphorylated serine and the DNA backbone and thereby impair binding. Ser365 is also close to, but not in direct

Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-isotope enriched samples were prepared using standard protocols that have been described in detail.19,20 The 14 bp and 17 bp DNA duplexes were prepared from complementary synthetic oligonucleotides (Keystone Biosource, Camarillo, CA), as described in detail.19­21 Complexes of the -KTS form of the WT1 protein and the DNA duplex were prepared by titrating protein aliquots into the DNA solution to a final stoichiometry of 1:1. All samples were prepared in 10 mM argon-saturated d11-Tris­HCl (pH 6.7) in a mixture of 90% H2O/10% 2H2O containing 20 mM KCl, 5 M ZnSO4, and 2 mM NaN3. The sample concentration of the -KTS WT1­ DNA complexes was 0.6 mM as estimated by the absorption at 260 nm and 280 nm. Preliminary characterization of the WT1­DNA complex The integrity of the WT1­DNA was checked by MALDITOF and NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). 1D NMR spectra were recorded to monitor the DNA imino resonances and 2D 15N-1H HSQC were used to monitor the protein amide resonances to ensure a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 between protein and DNA. Furthermore, the NMR spectra clearly showed that the protein is well folded, and the observation of DNA imino resonances is indicative of proper base-pairing. The ratio of signal intensities shows the presence of a 1:1 stoichiometry of protein to DNA (data not shown). Oligomerization state of WT1 zf1-4 The oligomerization state of the WT1 zf1-4 protein in complex with 14 and 17 bp DNA oligonucleotides was monitored by size exclusion chromatography. Gel filtration chromatography was performed on a 7.8 mm × 30 cm Phenomenex Biosep SEC-S20,000 column in 10 mM argonsaturated Tris­HCl (pH 6.7) containing 20 mM KCl, 5 M ZnSO4, and 2 mM NaN3. The protein concentration was 10 M and the flow rate was adjusted to 1 ml/min. The standard curve was established based on the following marker proteins obtained from BioRad: thyroglobulin, bovine -globulin, chicken ovalbumin, equine myoglobin, and vitamin B12. These data clearly showed that the complexes are monomeric in solution at micromolar concentrations. This finding is in good agreement with the linewidths observed in NMR spectra and NMR relaxation experiments, which are consistent with a monomeric protein­DNA complexes in solution, even at millimolar concentrations.20 Crystallization, data collection, structure determination, and refinement Crystals of the WT1­DNA (14 bp) complex were obtained in NMR tubes as described above at 277 K (Wilmad, USA) to an approximate size of 0.6 mm× 0.1 mm× 0.1 mm within four weeks. These batch-grown crystals were suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystals were indexed in hexagonal space group P6122 with one molecule per asymmetric unit (Table 1). The unit cell parameters are a =86.9 Å, b=86.9 Å, c=171.2 Å, and ==90°, =120° with a solvent content of 71.8%.59 After transfer to a cryo-protectant solution of the crystallization buffer containing an additional 30% (v/v) glycerol, crystals were flash-cooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 97 K. In-house diffraction data were collected from a single crystal on a MAR345 (MAR Research) image-plate detector using CuK radiation from a rotating-anode X-ray

contact with, the DNA backbone, and inhibition of DNA binding is probably due to charge repulsion. Implications for function The structure of WT1­KTS bound to its cognate DNA provides a molecular explanation for many published observations, especially for the wealth of mutagenesis and biochemical data on WT1.26 These studies showed a less pronounced influence of zf1 on the overall DNA binding affinity of WT1, consistent with its non-canonical interactions in the major groove. Finger 1 is not without function, however; the mutation Cys330Tyr, which would preclude zinc binding and disrupt the finger structure, is associated with DDS,52 which implies that an intact zf1 is required for normal physiological function. The only other zf1 point mutation known to be associated with disease replaces Met342 by arginine.53 Interestingly, this mutation places a potential base recognition side-chain in the site utilized for base contacts by finger 1 of YY1,46 suggesting the possibility that it could result in an aberrant gain of function by WT1. However, since the interactions of finger 1 with DNA are extremely weak,2,54,55 it is equally likely that the pathological effects of these zf1 mutations are associated with impaired binding of WT1 to RNA and/or other proteins. In this regard, the zinc finger domain of WT1 has been implicated in direct interactions with a number of cellular proteins, although which fingers are involved has not yet been determined.56­58 The structure of WT1­KTS bound to its cognate DNA provides new insights into the complexity and diversity of the molecular mechanisms by which zinc finger proteins achieve high-affinity binding to specific DNA sequences. The weakness of the finger 1 interaction provides a molecular level explanation for the dramatic consequences of alternative splicing in the zf3­zf4 linker. Splice variants with the +KTS insertion bind DNA as much as 1000-fold more weakly than the WT1­KTS isoform.55 We have shown earlier that the entropic cost of ordering the longer zf3­zf4 linker in WT1+KTS results in loss of DNA binding by finger 4.20 Since zf1 interacts only weakly with the DNA, docking in a non-canonical orientation in the major groove, it cannot compensate for the loss of overall binding affinity caused by dissociation of zf4 from the DNA, thereby amplifying the action of this splicing switch.

Experimental Procedures
Expression, purification, and complex formation The carboxy-terminal zinc finger domain of the Wilms tumor suppressor protein (WT1) was expressed and purified as published.19,20 This domain encompasses residues 318­435 of the WT1 protein, without the insertion of the Lys-Thr-Ser sequence between residues 407 and 408 (WT1 + KTS). Therefore, this domain is referred to as the -KTS form of the WT1 protein. In addition, this construct contains an N-terminal Ala due to the cloning procedure.20

generator operating at 50 kV and 100 mA. A complete data set was collected to 3.15 Å resolution at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) beamline 9-2 equipped with a ADSC Quantum 315 CCD detector. Data were integrated and scaled using DENZO and Scalepack.60 The structure of the -KTS form of the Wilms tumor suppressor protein in complex with a 14 bp DNA duplex, corresponding to its recognition element, was determined by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe61 using the coordinates of the EGR-1 (zif268) zinc finger­ DNA complex29 as a search model. This solution led to an electron density map that readily allowed tracing of the backbone of WT1. A rigid-body refinement and a positional refinement with bulk solvent correction were performed using the software package CNS.62 The interactive graphics program O was used for interpretation of the electron density map and model rebuilding.63 Each round of model rebuilding in O was followed by a positional refinement using standard restraints on bond distances and angles and a grouped Bfactor refinement in CNS.62,63 The stereochemical quality of the working model after each round of refinement was checked with PROCHECK.64,65 The statistics for the crystallographic refinement are given in Table 1. NMR spectroscopy and NMR based structure refinement The formation of the WT1­KTS­DNA complex was monitored by NMR spectroscopy at 310 K on a Bruker Avance900 spectrometer. The 1D NMR and 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectra were acquired as described.19,20 NMR spectra were processed with NMRPipe66 and analyzed with NMRView.67 The 1D NMR spectra were recorded to monitor the DNA imino resonances and 2D 15N-1H HSQC were used to monitor the protein amide resonances to ensure a ratio of 1:1 between protein and DNA. All spectra were recorded at 310 K on Bruker DRX600, DRX800, and AVANCE900 spectrometers equipped with pulsed field gradients and triple resonance probe heads. Backbone assignments were obtained from threedimensional HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCO.68,69 Side-chain assignments were obtained from three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, CCHCOSY, 15N-NOESY-HSQC, and 13C-NOESY-HSQC.70­74 The assignments of both the 14-mer and 17-mer DNA oligonucleotides were independently obtained from twodimensional NOESY spectra recorded with different mixing times ranging from 50 ms to 200 ms. The DNA assignments in the complexes were partially obtained by inferring the assignments from the free states and from double half filter spectra. However, only partial assignments could be made from these spectra as the DNA resonances in the complex were extremely broad, especially for the 14-mer complex. Nonetheless, the assignments of the THY11 and 13 methyl resonances could be made unambiguously in both complexes. Residual dipolar couplings were measured on a Bruker DRX800 MHz spectrometer using a 15N-labeled protein in 10 mM argon-saturated d11-Tris­HCl (pH 6.7) in a mixture of 90% H2O/10% 2H2O containing 20 mM KCl, 5 M ZnSO4, 2 mM NaN3, and Pf1 phage (obtained from ASLA, Latvia) at a concentration of approximately 14 mg/ml.75,76 Data were recorded for the complexes with both the 14 bp and 17 bp oligonucleotides. The concentration of the Pf1 was estimated from the observed splitting of the deuterium lock of approximately 13 Hz and the calibration curve provided by ASLA. Residual dipolar couplings of WT1 bound to the 14-mer DNA were extracted from a 2D IPAP 1H-15N HSQC spec-

The sweep width was 9615.385 Hz in the 1H and 2000.000 Hz in the 15 N dimension. All spectra were zero-filled to 2048 × 2048 points prior to Fourier transformation and sine window functions were applied in both dimensions. The RDC of WT1 bound to the 17-mer DNA were extracted from a 2D clean 1H-15N TROSY spectrum with water flip back and watergate solvent suppression78­80 recorded at 800.13 MHz proton frequency and at 310 K with a time domain of 1024 complex data points and 128 complex increments collected using 32 scans. The sweep width was 9615.385 Hz in the 1H and 3246.753 Hz in the 15N dimension. The spectra were zero-filled to 4096 × 2048 points prior to Fourier transformation and sine window functions were applied in both dimensions. All spectra were recorded in an interleaved manner to reduce influences from possible instabilities in experimental conditions. NMR-based structure refinement Initially, the residual dipolar couplings of WT1 in complex with both the short and long DNA oligonucleotides were analyzed with the MODULE software package.81 The alignment tensors for individual or multiple zinc finger domains of WT1 in complex with DNAwere determined by fitting the experimental RDCs to the X-ray structure. Zinc fingers 1 and 2­4 were fitted as independent substructures and zf1 was then rotated as a rigid body such that its individual alignment tensor was coincident to that calculated for the other three zinc fingers. In a more rigorous approach, the solution structure of the complexes of WT1 with both the 14 bp and 17 bp oligonucleotides were modeled by "refinement" of the X-ray structures by molecular dynamics simulated annealing using restraints derived from the crystal structure, supplemented by experimental NMR-derived restraints (Table 2). The quality of the NMR data was insufficient to permit a priori structure calculations based on experimental NMR restraints alone. Intermolecular proton­proton distance restraints for all four zinc fingers were derived from crosspeak intensities in filter-edit NOESY spectra and were binned into distances of 2.7, 3.3, 5.0 and 6.0 Å. The protein backbone chemical shifts were used to generate  and  dihedral angle restraints with TALOS.34 Hydrogen bond restraints were added for well-defined protein secondary structure elements with upper restraints of 2.0 Å and 3.0 Å, lower restraints of 1.8 Å and 2.7 Å, for acceptor atom to donor proton and heavy atoms, respectively. Zinc ligand distances in all four zinc fingers were based on the canonical distances of 2.3 Å for zinc­sulfur coordination and 2.0 Å for zinc­nitrogen coordination. The zinc finger structures were modeled using synthetic proton­proton distance restraints derived from a minimal set of canonical distances for Cys2His2 type zinc fingers; these canonical restraints were checked against the WT1 X-ray structure to ensure that they were compatible. These constraints were supplemented by additional carbon­carbon distance restraints derived directly from the X-ray structure of the WT1 14 bp DNA complex. No inter-finger distance restraints were used in the simulated annealing calculations to allow flexibility in docking to the DNA. For zinc fingers 2­4, the experimental intermolecular distance restraints derived from the NOESY spectra were supplemented by intermolecular carbon­carbon and carbon­

WT1­DNA Complex Structure nitrogen distance bounds between WT1 and the DNA that were based on the X-ray structure. Backbone 1H-15N residual dipolar coupling constants were used as orientational restraints for all four zinc fingers. The DNA structures used for docking were derived from the X-ray structure of WT1. The frayed end of the 14-mer DNA structure was remodeled as canonical B-form DNA. The three base-pair extension of the 17-mer DNA was also modeled from canonical B-form DNA. The canonical zinc finger restraints were used to generate 200 starting structures of the free WT1 protein using torsion angle dynamics in CYANA.82 A structure of the modeled DNA was added to each starting structure with a minimal 30 Å offset from the protein structure. The zinc fingers were docked onto the DNA structure by in vacuo molecular dynamics through seven cycles of simulated annealing using AMBER 8.83 Intermolecular restraints were omitted during the first cycle of annealing after heating to 1000 K for 6 ps. In the remaining cycles, the heating prior to annealing was reduced to 400 K for 6 ps. During the second through fifth cycles of annealing, the intermolecular distance restraints were gradually decreased from 50 Å to 10 to 8 Å to final distance while the restraint energy for intermolecular distances was increased from 0 to 1 to 10 to 20 to 30 kcal/ mol Å2. Residual dipolar couplings were stepped into the sixth and seventh cycle of annealing by setting the weights at 0.0 during heating for 6 ps, 0.01 during initial cooling for 6 ps and 0.1 through the remaining cool down period of 28 ps. The alignment tensor was allowed to float throughout the calculation and was fitted by steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimization for each structure prior to annealing. The seventh cycle of simulated annealing with all restraints was followed by a steepest descent and conjugate gradient minimization to yield the final structures. The best 20 structures were selected on the basis of lowest overall AMBER energy values after minimization with all distance, torsion and residual dipolar coupling restraints. Accession numbers The Protein Data Bank accession number for the Wilms tumor suppressor protein­DNA co-crystal structure is 2PRT, and for the NMR structures of zf1-4 with the 14 bp and 17 bp DNA oligonucleotides are 2JPA and 2JP9, respectively.
