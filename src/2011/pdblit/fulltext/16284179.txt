We have identified a small-molecule inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) that promotes subunit disassembly of this trimeric cytokine family member. The compound inhibits TNF-a activity in biochemical and cell-based assays with median inhibitory concentrations of 22 and 4.6 micromolar, respectively. Formation of an intermediate complex between the compound and the intact trimer results in a 600-fold accelerated subunit dissociation rate that leads to trimer dissociation. A structure solved by x-ray crystallography reveals that a single compound molecule displaces a subunit of the trimer to form a complex with a dimer of TNF-a subunits. Direct inhibition of TNF-a by the commercial biological agents etanercept (Enbrel, Amgen Incorporated, Thousand Oaks, CA, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, PA), infliximab (Remicade, Centocor, Horsham, PA, ScheringPlough, Kenilworth, NJ), and adalimumab (Humira, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) has produced significant advances in rheumatoid arthritis treatment and validated the extracellular inhibition of this proinflammatory cytokine as an effective therapy. However, despite considerable incentives, viable leads for analogous small-molecule inhibitors of TNF-a have not been reported (1). Thus far, small-molecule antagonists of TNF-a activity have typically been limited to inhibitors of the processing enzyme TACE (2), uncharacterized inhibitors of TNF-a expression (3­7), uncharacterized inhibitors of TNF-a cell-based assays (8, 9), and other intracellular pathway inhibitors that antagonize nuclear factor kB (NF-kB), activating protein 1 (AP1), or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/ p38 signal transduction. Although progress has been made in developing small molecules capable of disrupting such protein-protein interactions, this process remains a very difficult challenge (10, 11). We discovered a compound (Fig. 1A) composed of trifluoromethylphenyl indole and dimethyl chromone moieties linked by a dimethylamine spacer that inhibited TNF-a receptor binding (12). Potency measurements showed a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 22 mM for inhibiting in vitro TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) binding to TNF-a (Fig. 1B). Comparable potency was observed for inhibiting TNF-a-mediated stimulation of inhibitor of NF-kB (IkB) degradation in HeLa cells but not for orthogonal interleukin1b (IL-1b)­mediated stimulation of the same pathway (Fig. 1C). The x-ray crystal structure was solved for TNF-a­compound complex crystals gener-

ated from an equimolar mixture of TNF-a and compound in solution (table S1). Prior efforts to produce diffraction-quality co-crystals by soaking compound into native TNF-a crystals had failed and often resulted in the cracking of those crystals. Molecular replacement with the coordinates from a single subunit of the 1TNF.pdb structure (13) readily solved the structure after failures with intact trimer coordinates. This phenomenon was explained when it was revealed that the compound had displaced one of the subunits from the TNF-a trimer (Fig. 2A). The resulting TNF-a dimer retained the same basic structural subunit fold as the native trimer, but the angle between the subunits within the dimer was slightly widened (Fig. 2B). Clear x-ray density showed the compound bound within a shallow pocket (Fig. 2C) and contacting residues from each subunit of the TNF-a dimer (table S2). Remarkably, these contact surfaces are found completely buried within the subunit interfaces of the intact TNF-a trimer crystal structure. The compound in this structure is in a compact conformation, with the trifluoromethylphenyl indole and dimethyl chromone moieties folded back upon one another. The binding surface for the compound on the TNF-a dimer is composed of 16 contact residues, including 6 tyrosine residues (Fig. 2D). Nine are presented from chain A EL57, Y59, S60, Q61, Y119, L120, G121, G122, and Y151 (14)^. The remaining seven are a subset of these residues presented from chain B (L57¶, Y59¶, S60¶, Y119¶, L120¶, G121¶, and Y151¶ ). The identity of the residues that occupy these positions in other trimeric cytokine family members is shown in table S2. Tyr119 is notable in being located close to the threefold symmetry axis of the TNF-a trimer and in making contact with its counterparts from the other monomeric subunits. Its chi-1 angle ro-

In spite of burying about 330 )2 (15) of protein surface, no intermolecular hydrogen bonds or salt bridges are formed, suggesting that the interaction is largely hydrophobic and shape-driven. Because the compound contacted residues that are buried in the TNF-a trimer, we

examined whether it could dissociate the trimer under the conditions used for the in vitro activity measurements. To this end, we immobilized singly biotinylated 3H-TNF-a trimer onto a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) microtiter plate. Addition of the compound at concentrations that inhibit TNFR1 binding induced shedding of subunits from the TNF-a trimer (Fig. 3A). Experiments measuring the decrease in receptor SCIENCE VOL 310

binding after washing away dissociated subunits gave an IC50 of 13 mM (Fig. 3B). This was reproducibly twofold more potent than the value when receptor was present along with the compound (Fig. 1B), consistent with the notion that TNFR1 binding can stabilize TNF-a trimer. Because the crystal structure indicated that the compound should induce formation of TNF-a dimer, we examined whether this could be observed in solution. To this end, we used mass spectrometry to examine the oligomeric state of TNF-a in the presence of the compound (12). Conditions were established that allowed the measurement of the noncovalently associated TNF-a trimer (Fig. 4A). Compound addition under these conditions resulted in the conversion of TNF-a trimer to dimer (Fig. 4B). Additionally, about 20% of the TNF-a dimer observed existed as a complex with a single compound molecule, thereby reproducing the stoichiometry observed in the x-ray structure. Lastly, we performed hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments to check for the expected increase in exposed surface area per TNF-a subunit in the dimer form. Measurements showed that addition of compound

Spectrum is a deconvoluted neutral scale mass spectrum of noncovalent TNF-a trimer complex visualized as three peaks due to plus and minus N-terminal methionine heterogeneity of TNF-a sample. The observed masses of 52,052, 52,182, and 52,312 daltons corresponds to the trimer complex containing either zero, one, or two subunits with N-terminal methionines, respectively. (B) Analogous spectrum of 10 mM TNF-a incubated with 100 mM SP307. Masses at 34,704 and 35,252 correspond to noncovalent complex of TNF-a dimer and TNF-a dimer­compound, respectively. (C) Increase in TNF-a exchangeable hydrogens induced by compound. Plot shows time course for hydrogen-deuterium exchange of 1 mM TNF-a dissolved into either D2O alone (open circles) or D2O plus 30 mM compound (solid circles). Procedure was performed as described (12). Calculations of exposed surface area predict 88, 99, and 110 exchangeable hydrogens for each subunit within the TNF-a trimer, dimer, and monomer structures, respectively (21, 22). (D) TNF-a subunit dissociation rates in the presence and absence of compound. The relief of fluorescence homoquenching of 100 nM T7C-AF TNF-a after dilution in a 200-fold excess of unlabeled TNF-a was used to monitor subunit disassociation from TNF-a trimer (solid circles). Nonlinear regression analysis using the appropriate kinetics equation (12) gave a calculated rate of 0.000093 sj1 per monomer dissociation event (solid circles). Addition of 30 mM compound to the homoquenching assay accelerates the observed time course of fluorescence increase and yields a calculated rate constant of 0.059 sj1 per monomer dissociation event (solid triangles). Open circles show fluorescence in the absence of added unlabeled TNF-a. Error bars represent the standard deviation of triplicate measurements.

caused about 13 additional hydrogens per TNF-a to become surface-exposed (Fig. 4C). This number compares favorably with the 11 additional exchangeable hydrogens calculated for the TNF-a dimer relative to the published TNF-a trimer structure (12). These results suggest that the TNF-a dimer is more prevalent than TNF-a monomer (22 expected additional exchangeable hydrogens) under these conditions. We considered two possible models to explain how the compound acts to cause formation of TNF-a dimer. In the first, predissociation-dependent model, the compound functions passively by binding to and stabilizing the TNF-a dimer only after a TNF-a trimer subunit has spontaneously dissociated. In the second, predissociationindependent model, the compound functions actively by interacting with the TNF-a trimer to promote the dissociation of a subunit to form TNF-a dimer.

To discern which mechanism operates, we developed a sensitive fluorescence homoquenching­ based assay (16) to examine the kinetics of subunit dissociation from the TNF-a trimer. In this assay, we monitored the decrease in fluorescein homoquenching that occurs when closely associated molecules become separated. A TNF-a mutant (T7C) having a free thiol in the region of the disordered N terminus was covalently coupled to the 5-iodoacetamidoflouroscein (5-IAF) so that each subunit of TNF-a trimer was fluorescently labeled. Binding analysis of this highly fluorescent adduct reagent (called T7C-AF) showed it possessed the same affinity for TNFR1 as did unmodified wild-type TNF-a. Addition of the T7C-AF reagent to a 200fold excess of unlabeled TNF-a resulted in a time-dependent increase in fluorescence as dissociating T7C-AF subunits were replaced by subunits not fluorescently tagged (Fig. 4D). Fitting the resulting curves to the appropriate SCIENCE

kinetic equation (12) by nonlinear regression analysis allowed us to determine the dissociation rate of monomer subunits from the TNF-a trimer to be 0.000093 sj1. The addition of 30 mM compound resulted in a much more rapid subunit dissociation rate of 0.057 sj1, representing a 600-fold acceleration from the spontaneous dissociation rate of TNF-a (Fig. 4D). Additionally, time course experiments using the TNFR1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed rapid TNF-a inactivation consistent with these measurements (fig. S3). The highly accelerated dissociation rate indicates that the compound actively promotes subunit dissociation and functions through the predissociationindependent model described previously. This finding implies that the initial step for inactivation is the binding of the compound to TNF-a trimer to form an intermediate complex that undergoes accelerated subunit dissociation. We found evidence for compound association with intact trimer from studies done at superphysiological TNF-a concentrations. Analysis by sedimentation equilibrium of a mixture of 45 mM TNF-a and 68 mM compound was performed, and compound migration within that mixture was tracked by its absorbance at 310 nm. The compound migrated with an apparent molecular weight consistent with being bound to intact TNF-a trimer (fig. S4). Moreover, measurements by tandem gel filtration and dynamic light scattering showed that 3 to 30 mM TNF-a concentrations retained the molecular weight of trimer in the presence of 30 mM compound (table S3). Lastly, we showed that the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (ITF) of 0.5 to 5 mM TNF-a was 85% quenched by addition of 50 mM compound, suggesting that the compound is bound in proximity to Trp28 and Trp114 within the TNF-a trimer. Measurements of the rate of restoration of TNF-a ITF after a 10-fold dilution of this quenched complex to a concentration well below the IC50 of the compound showed that the effect is reversible and that the dissociation rate of the compound from the TNF-a trimer is rapid (fig. S5). Taken together, our results indicate that the compound-associated TNF-a trimer predicted by the predissociation-independent model exists and represents a more weakly associated oligomeric form than the free TNF-a trimer. Under lower physiologically relevant TNF-a concentrations, this proposed complex is highly unstable and rapidly inactivated by subunit dissociation. However, at higher superphysiological TNF-a concentrations there is sufficient TNF-a present to stabilize compound-associated TNF-a trimer as the prevalent form at equilibrium. The co-structure and mechanism of action of the TNF-a inhibitor described herein

demonstrates that small molecules that function by disrupting tightly preassociated oligomeric proteins are feasible. Although small-molecule inhibitors that block dimer formation exist for a number of intracellular homodimeric proteins (10, 17), many may function through a predissociation-dependent mechanism. For example, an inhibitor (18, 19) of inducible nitrous oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibits the intracellular association of iNOS monomers into enzymatically active iNOS dimer yet is inactive against isolated dimeric iNOS. Inhibitors of this type may have limited utility against extracellular preassembled multimeric proteins like TNF-a that have very slow spontaneous subunit dissociation rates. In contrast, the TNF-a inhibitor we describe binds to the intact biologically active trimer and accelerates subunit dissociation to rapidly inactivate the cytokine. Interestingly, this activity together with the co-structure of the TNF-a dimer compound complex suggests that the compound is able to access the normally buried interior of TNF-a trimer. It is possible that the compound achieves this by exploiting an intrinsic dynamic breathing between the subunit interfaces that may occur in solution-phase TNF-a trimer, but the precise mechanism by which the compound functions remains to be elucidated. The results we have described should enable the design of appropriate assays that may allow for the identification of potent small-molecule inhibitors that inactivate multimeric proteins via a rapid predissociation-independent subunit dissociation process.

The third variable region (V3) of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein is immunodominant and contains features essential for coreceptor binding. We determined the structure of V3 in the context of an HIV-1 gp120 core complexed to the CD4 receptor and to the X5 antibody at 3.5 angstrom resolution. Binding of gp120 to cell-surface CD4 would position V3 so that its coreceptor-binding tip protrudes 30 angstroms from the core toward the target cell membrane. The extended nature and antibody accessibility of V3 explain its immunodominance. Together, the results provide a structural rationale for the role of V3 in HIV entry and neutralization. The HIV envelope spike mediates binding to receptors and virus entry Ereviewed in (1)^. The trimeric spike is composed of three gp120 exterior and three gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoproteins. CD4 binding to gp120 in the spike induces conformational changes that allow binding to a coreceptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, which is required for viral entry (2­6). Snapshots of the gp120 entry mechanism have been visualized through crystal structures of unliganded and CD4-bound states (7, 8). However, an essential component of the coreceptor binding site, the third variable region (V3), has been absent from previous structural characterizations of the gp120 core. V3 typically consists of 35 amino acids (range 31 to 39) and plays a number of important biological roles Ereviewed in (9)^. Not only is it critical for coreceptor binding, but it also determines which coreceptor, CXCR4 or CCR5, will be used for entry (10). In addition, V3 may interact with other elements in the viral spike to control the overall sensitivity of the virus to neutralization (11). Finally, immuSCIENCE VOL 310

nization with HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins often elicits neutralizing responses directed primarily against V3 (12, 13). The structure of V3 in the context of core gp120 bound to CD4, described here, now reveals the entire coreceptor binding site. We propose that V3 acts as a molecular hook, not only for snaring coreceptor but also for modulating subunit associations within the viral spike. Its extended nature is compatible with the elicitation of an immunodominant antibody response. The extreme glycosylation and conformational flexibility of gp120 inhibit crystallization. We used variational crystallization and various technologies adapted from structural genomics to obtain crystals suitable for x-ray structural analysis (14­16). Constructs of the gp120 core with V3 from three clade B isolates (HXBc2, JR-FL, and YU2) were expressed in
