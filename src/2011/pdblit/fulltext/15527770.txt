Abstract The interferon (IFN) system is a major effector of the innate immunity that allows time for the subsequent establishment of an adaptive immune response against wide-range pathogens. The effectiveness of IFN to control initial infection requires the cooperation between several pathways induced in the target cells. Recent studies that highlight the implication of the 30 e50 exonuclease ISG20 (IFN Stimulated Gene product of 20 kDa) in the host's defenses against pathogens are summarised in this review.

1. Introduction Cellular and extracellular ribonucleases appear to be major contributors to the protection against various pathogens including viruses and bacteria. RNase L, the first discovered IFN-activated RNase (reviewed by C. Bisbal and R.H. Silverman in this issue) is a dormant cytosolic endoribonuclease that is activated by short oligoadenylates produced by the 20 e50 oligoadenylate synthetase following viral infection or double-stranded RNA treatment. Degradation of viral RNAs and cleavage of cellular 18S and 28S rRNAs by the activated-RNase L lead to the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus preventing viral propagation. Since then, some other ribonucleases have been suspected or demonstrated to be involved in antiviral defenses. In particular, RNases targeting the dsRNA formed in almost all viral infections represent good candidates for ribonuclease-mediated antiviral effects. Indeed, dsRNA duplexes can be hyper-edited by members of the adenosine deaminase enzyme family (ADA) resulting in up to 50% adenosine to inosine conversion and a specific cleavage by a cytoplasmic endoribonuclease that requires a RNA structure fitted to hyper-edited RNA [1,2]. This process provides an

efficient mechanism to remove long uninterrupted dsRNAs associated with virus infection, suggesting that the IFN-inducible cytoplasmic isoform of ADA (ADAR1) represents a new pathway in the IFN-mediated antiviral action. In addition, adenosine to inosine editing dramatically changes the stability of dsRNA structures, resulting in a stronger vulnerability to attacks by single-stranded RNases [3]. In particular, inosine-containing single-stranded RNA and unwinding dsRNA edited by ADAR1 have been reported to be highly degraded by a specific 30 e50 exonuclease termed I-RNase [4]. Some extracellular ribonucleases also display antiviral properties. The eosinophil-derived neurotoxin protein (EDN or RNase2) and the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP or RNase3), members of the RNase A family found in secretory granules of human eosinophilic leukocytes, reduce the infectivity of certain RNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5] and HIV [6]. In the same way, human onconase has been shown to act as a ribonuclease-dependent antiviral agent [7]. 2. ISG20, a 30 e50 exonuclease induced by interferon The human ISG20 gene (IFN Stimulated Gene product of 20 kDa) was first identified based on its increased expression in response to IFN treatment [8e10]. Its modulation by type I and type II IFNs is under the control of the transcription

factors IRF-1 on a unique Interferon Stimulated Response Element (ISRE) [10e12]. In the mean time, ISG20 was independently identified by its induction in response to estrogen hormone and termed HEM45 (human estrogen regulated transcript) [13]. Amino acid sequence analysis underlines that the encoded ISG20 protein is a member of the DEDDh subgroup of the DEDD exonuclease superfamily, which includes RNases such as RNase T and D, the proofreading domains of the Pol I family of DNA polymerases, and other DNA exonucleases [14,15]. This superfamily is characterized by a large structurally related exonuclease domain of about 150 amino acids (EXO III domain) in which homologies are distributed at three distinct exonuclease motifs termed Exo I, Exo II, and Exo III defined by four conserved acidic amino acids, three aspartate (D) and one glutamate (E) and a conserved histidine (h) residues (Fig. 1). Members of this superfamily can have both RNase and DNase activities and require two divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. The crystal structure of ISG20 reveals an exonuclease domain very similar to those of the corresponding domains of two DEDDh DNases, the 3 subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III and E. coli exonuclease I, suggesting that they could follow the same catalytic mechanism [16]. However, ISG20 recognizes the sugar moiety of the nucleotide in a slightly different manner from the two DNases. Indeed, the presence of two distinctive residues, Met14 and Arg53 in the active site of ISG20, that accommodate hydrogen bonds of the 20 -OH group of the UMP ribose may reflect for the preference of ISG20 for RNA substrates [16]. Accordingly, biochemical analysis has confirmed ISG20 as a 30 e50 exonuclease with a preference for single stranded RNA over single stranded DNA [17]. The presence of a stem-loop structure at the 30 end of RNA substrates causes a strong reduction in ISG20 RNase activity indicating that ISG20 operates poorly on double-stranded regions [17]. Like some members of DEDD superfamily recombinant ISG20 possesses a weak single stranded DNase activity. However, the exact in vivo contribution of this activity is not established. The observation that the substitution of a single conserved aspartic acid by a glycine residue is sufficient to abolish its exonuclease activity demonstrates that ISG20 is functionally related to the DEDD superfamily [17]. Interestingly, ISG20 appears solely composed of a unique exonuclease catalytic domain without apparent regulatory domain (Fig. 1) suggesting that the regulation of ISG20 activity may require complex interactions with other factors leading to a local and specific activation preventing non-specific cell toxicity. Indeed, RNases are typically present in very low amount in cells associated with a specific inhibitor or present in an inactive latent form requiring the presence of a specific activator. This is the case for RNase L whose activation is dependent

on the presence of oligoadenylates synthesized by the 20 e50 oligoadenylate synthetase in response to replicating dsRNA forms of viruses. The fact that overexpression of exogenous ISG20 appears detrimental for cell survival highlights the necessity of a strict control of its activity. 3. ISG20 expression in response to pathogen infections Several studies, using microarray approaches strongly suggest that ISG20 may be a major effector of innate immune response against various pathogens including viruses, bacteria and parasites (Table 1). For example, ISG20 is induced in the liver of acutely hepatitis B virus-infected Chimpanzee during viral clearance, reflecting the impact of an adaptive T cell response that inhibits viral replication and kills infected cells [18]. During human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, ISG20 expression is rapidly and strongly induced [19,20]. This induction seems to be dependent on the viral transcription activator Tat in immature human dendritic cells [21]. Interestingly, ISG20 induction was observed both in HIV-1 and adeno-Tat infections, in absence of detectable IFNs in the culture supernatants suggesting that its overexpression can occur directly through activation of cellular and viral transcription factors. In contrast, in human postmitotic neuronderivative cell line, NT2-N, the induction of ISG20 expression by rabies virus (RABV) infection seems to be mediated through the production of b-IFN [22]. The involvement of IFN secretion in the induction of ISG20 observed during infection by other pathogens remains to be determined. On the other hand, ISG20 expression appears strongly induced, independently of IFN secretion, through the activation of members of the interleukine-1/Toll receptor super-family (Toll-like receptor) by different pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns (PAMPs) known to exert a strong adjuvant effect on immune responses such as, oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs [23], bacterial lipopolysaccharides [24,25], double stranded RNAs [12] and small interfering RNAs [26,27]. In this later case, the effect seems to be mediated both by IFN induction through the activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, and independently of an IFN response by the activation of the transcription factor interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) [27]. Infection leads to activation of the TLRs, which in turn initiate intracellular signaling cascades that culminate in the activation of NF-kB/Rel family transcription factors. Thus, NF-kB has often been referred to as a central mediator of the immune response [28]. Interestingly, we demonstrated that ISG20 is induced by dsRNA using a sequential process involving, first the NF-kB transcription factors family, and later, the IRF-1 transcription factor [12]. On the basis of these

observations, it is reasonable to speculate that NF-kB can participate to the modulation of ISG20 by the different PAMPs. Obviously, further studies are needed to determine exactly this point. 4. ISG20 exhibits antiviral activity against RNA genomic viruses The effectiveness with which the host's antiviral response can control initial virus infection to gain time for the establishment of an adaptive immune response, requires the cooperation between several antiviral pathways which limit further viral growth and spread [29]. Each of these pathways affects different stages of the viral life cycle including, penetration, early and late replication events, assembly, budding and release of virions [29]. We have demonstrated that ISG20, whose expression is strongly induced by IFN type I and type II, defines a new IFN-induced antiviral pathway with an apparent preference for RNA genomic viruses [30]. Indeed, its overexpression confers HeLa cells resistance to infection by some RNA viruses such as, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infections but does not have action against an adenovirus strain bearing a b-galactosidase reporter gene. However, the protective efficiency of ISG20 seems to be variable even among RNA viruses since protection against influenza virus and EMCV is less efficient than against VSV infection. The fact that a dominant negative form of ISG20 significantly reduces the ability of IFN to block VSV but not EMCV or influenza virus developments suggests that ISG20 partly mediates the IFN antiviral effect against VSV with minor contribution against influenza virus and EMCV infections [30]. How ISG20 can specifically affect virus replication remains unclear. As no antiviral effect was observed in cells overexpressing a mutated ISG20 protein defective in exonuclease activity, it is tempting to speculate that, throughout its 30 e50 RNase activity, ISG20 can affect viral development by degrading viral RNA. However, ISG20 can also act indirectly on cellular factors required for the viral

replication or transcription. Accordingly, ISG20 inhibits VSV replication without any apparent global alteration in the cellular RNA profile reflecting probably the specificity of its action [30]. It has been reported that IFNs display a potent antiviral effect both in acute and chronic HIV-1 infections [31,32]. As, ISG20 is rapidly and strongly induced during HIV-1 infection it represents a good candidate for controlling HIV infection. To investigate whether ISG20 could interfere with HIV-1 infection, the same approach successfully used to analyze the effect of RNase L was developed [33]. In this study, the replication kinetic of an HIV-1-derived virus expressing the ISG20 protein, in place of the Nef gene (HIV-1NL4-3ISG20), was severely delayed both in CEM cells and PBMCs, reflecting the ineffectiveness of virus to replicate in cells overexpressing ISG20 [20]. HIV-1 uses several strategies to escape cellular antiviral pathways. In particular, the negative selective pressure imposed by a transgene present into the viral genome, frequently results in mutation or partial deletion of the transgene [33]. Surprisingly, on the contrary to what it was previously described for RNase L, despite the antiviral activity of ISG20 protein, virus rescue observed in HIV-1NL4-3ISG20 infected cells is not due to mutation or partial deletion in the ISG20 transgene pointing on the ability of HIV-1 to bypass the mechanism of ISG20 action. Accordingly, the emergence of the recombinant virus, in HIV-1NL4-3ISG20 infected cells seems to be associated with the inhibition of HIV-1-induced apoptosis rather than to the inactivation of ISG20 activity. Now, the identification of RNA cellular targets of ISG20 remains a main challenge for the comprehension of its mechanism of antiviral action. Additional studies with several other RNA and DNA viruses are also needed to clarify precisely its viral specificities. 5. Role of ISG2O in the cellular physiology Amino-acid comparison reveals that ISG20 might be a human homolog of the yeast protein Rex4p, member of the Rex DEDD subfamily [34]. Interestingly, various Rex proteins have been shown to have a unique and overlapping function in the processing of many RNA species, including 5S and 5.8S rRNAs, U4 and U5 small RNAs (snRNAs) [34]. Even though the exact specificity of Rex4p fails to be determined, these data suggest that ISG20 might be involved in the processing of RNA. Moreover, the subcellular localization of ISG20 argues for its implication in the maturation of snRNAs and rRNAs, and in ribosome biogenesis. Indeed, in addition to a diffuse cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic localization, the endogenous ISG20 protein is present in the nucleus both in the nucleolus and in the Cajal bodies (CBs) [35]. The reorganization of the nucleolus in three distinct functional domains after the drug inhibition of rRNA synthesis has revealed that ISG20 is concentrated in the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus, the major site for the early steps of rRNA processing [35]. The CBs are non-membrane-bound nuclear suborganelles implicated in the post-transcriptional maturation of small nuclear (snRNAs) and small nucleolar (snoRNAs)

RNAs [36e41]. Their presence in the cells is the marker of active transcriptional processes. Although these data are consistent with the involvement of ISG20 in cellular RNA processing, what can be the exact role of a 30 e50 exoribonuclease both in the CBs and the nucleolus? It is well established that many eukaryotic RNAs undergo precise 30 trimming that accurately processes 30 -extended precursors to mature RNAs. In particular, the U3 snoRNA synthesized in the nucleoplasm is 30 -end processed by an unknown exonuclease within the CBs [42,43]. Then, the mature U3 snoRNPs are imported to the nucleoli where they act as guide RNAs in pre-rRNA cleavage during ribosome biogenesis [44]. On the basis of these observations, it is tempting to speculate that ISG20 can participate in the maturation of U3 snoRNA and then be transported in the DFC with the large ribonucleoprotein U3 to participate in the final steps of rRNA processing. Nevertheless, that does not rule out the possibility that, upon IFN treatment, ISG20 might act only as a degradation enzyme leading to the control of protein synthesis, namely by modulating the level of both snRNAs and rRNAs. Indeed, it has been reported that IFN can regulate the expression of cellular genes at the RNA level [45,46] suggesting that control of RNA stability may play a major role in the mechanism of IFN action. However, the distributive exonuclease activity of ISG20 argues for its involvement in the maturation rather than in the degradation of RNAs. Obviously, the exact mechanism by which this exonuclease is involved in the cellular defenses against bacterial and viral pathogens has to be explored in depth. Unfortunately, attempts to inhibit ISG20 expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) have remained unsuccessful because ISG20 expression is strongly and non-specifically induced by siRNA [26,27]. The elucidation of the exact functions of this highly regulated 30 e 50 exonuclease, will probably emerge from proteomic approaches to identify direct molecular partners of ISG20. References
