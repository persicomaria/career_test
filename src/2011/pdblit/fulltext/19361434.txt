Abstract The Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis is extremely well adapted to changing environmental conditions. The chaperoneprotease ClpCP and other AAAþ proteases constitute an important component of the B. subtilis protein quality control system that is essential for survival during stress. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries concerning the molecular mechanism, regulation and localization of proteases and chaperones in B. subtilis. Ó 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1. Introduction Protein folding stress is a problem encountered by all living organisms [24]. Environmental conditions such as heat, oxidative stress and extreme pH values lead to the destabilization of protein structure. Unfolding, in turn, results in the exposure of hydrophobic polypeptide stretches that are normally buried deep within the core of globular proteins. At high concentration, unfolded hydrophobic regions from different polypeptides coagulate and irreversibly form aggregates. Such aggregated proteins are biologically inactive if not toxic, and thus interfere with vital cellular functions. Even under non-stress conditions, unfolded proteins are present in the cell in small amounts, especially at sites of protein synthesis, de novo folding and translocation [42]. In the course of evolution, cells have developed two main strategies to cope with folding stress and protein aggregation, namely molecular chaperones and general proteolysis [11,72,5]. Chaperones such as Hsp70/DnaK bind and stabilize unfolded regions of proteins, keeping them separated from unspecific

interaction partners. The Hsp60/GroEL-GroES machine provides an isolated environment for proper folding of small protein substrates. Trigger factor, a ribosome-associated chaperone, is thought to assist the co-translational folding of protein domains emerging from the ribosome exit tunnel [42]. The exact mechanism of this molecular chaperone remains to be elucidated. Finally, specialized chaperones of the Hsp100 class such as ClpB, in combination with DnaK, its co-chaperones and small heat shock proteins, are able to disaggregate and refold large protein aggregates [71]. However, at times when the cellular chaperone arsenal is insufficient to cope with a flood of unfolded and aggregated proteins, the cell has to make use of proteases to irreversibly clear the cytoplasm of aggregated polypeptides. These proteases must be able to distinguish between target and non-target proteins in order to prevent unwanted degradation of active functioning proteins. A first step to avoid such unwanted degradation is the use of self-compartmentalized proteases. A hallmark example of these molecular machines is the eukaryotic 26S proteasome. Although eubacteria, except for actinobacteria [7], do not contain proteasomes, they comprise analogous protease complexes. Protease subunits such as ClpP form a multimeric barrel-like structure in which the active protease sites are situated on the inside of a cavity, protecting

cytosolic proteins from degradation. The access of substrates to this cavity is regulated by hexameric rings of AAAþ ATPases of the Clp/Hsp100 family, which associate with the protease multimer on one or both sides (see also accompanying reviews) [2]. On its own, ClpP only degrades small peptides and unfolded proteins very slowly [28,3]. In the active chaperoneprotease complex, the Clp ATPase hexamers recognize substrates, unfold them in an ATP-dependent manner and translocate the unfolded polypeptide chains into the proteolytic chamber of the protease complex, where they are degraded into small peptides [2]. Substrate recognition and selection by the Hsp100/Clp proteins is assisted in many cases by adaptor proteins which are able to bind simultaneously to cognate substrates and accessory domains of the Clp ATPase [37]. The endospore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis has been studied extensively as a paradigm for the Gram-positive branch of the bacterial kingdom. However, protein quality control by chaperones and proteases in this organism is still not well understood. B. subtilis contains three Clp/Hsp100 proteins, namely ClpC, ClpE and ClpX [61,20,8]. These ATPases can associate with the double-heptameric serine protease ClpP [21]. In addition, B. subtilis features two paralogs of Lon [60], in which the unfoldase and protease activities reside on a single polypeptide chain, FtsH, a membrane-associated metalloprotease [9] and the ClpYQ complex. Interestingly, B. subtilis does not encode a homolog of the ClpP-independent disaggregase ClpB. In addition to protein quality control by proteolysis, there are also many examples of regulatory proteolysis in B. subtilis. Interestingly, the very same protease complexes are utilized for both functions. For example, ClpC, together with its adaptor protein MecA, targets the master regulator of competence development, ComK, for degradation by ClpP during vegetative growth. When cells have reached stationary phase, the small protein ComS is produced in response to a quorum-sensing signal. ComS subsequently interacts with MecA, which leads to the release and stabilization of ComK and results in competence development in a subpopulation of stationary phase cells [69]. Other prominent targets of regulatory proteolysis include the sporulation anti-anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB [55], the master regulator of oxidative stress response Spx [53] and the repressor of class III heat shock genes CtsR ([34], see below). It is interesting to note that ClpP of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria was recently identified as a target for the antibiotic ADEP. This compound has two activities. First, it disrupts the interaction between ClpP and the Clp ATPases [4,36]. Since these dissociated ClpCP and ClpXP complexes are no longer able to degrade their cognate substrates, addition of ADEP to B. subtilis cells appears similar to the phenotype of a clpP mutant strain. The second gain of function activity of ADEP is that it enables free ADEP-activated ClpP to arbitrarily degrade unfolded proteins such as nascent protein chains emerging from the ribosome [36]. This finding corroborates the importance of proteolysis for bacterial physiology. In this review, we present recent developments in the field of proteolysis and protein quality control in B. subtilis. We

focus on the important ClpCP chaperone-protease complex and its adaptor proteins and discuss its involvement in protein quality control, the mechanism of activation and substrate selection by adaptor proteins, its role in the regulation of heat shock genes and its cellular localization. 2. Protein quality control in B. subtilis The soil-dwelling bacterium B. subtilis is very well adapted to changing environmental conditions. In contrast to E. coli, B. subtilis is able to grow at temperatures well above 50  C [70]. This raises the question of how protein quality control works in this organism. Both the B. subtilis and the E. coli genomes encode the same homologous chaperone systems (GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/ GrpE, trigger factor, Hsp90/HtpG), with the notable exceptions of ClpB and homologs of the small heat shock proteins IbpA and IbpB. Interestingly, a dnaK deletion has only a modest temperature-sensitive phenotype in B. subtilis [63], compared with a significant growth defect in E. coli [54]. This difference is in part due to the involvement of DnaK in the heat shock regulation of E. coli, [17,67] whereas regulation of the heat shock repressor HrcA is exerted by GroEL/GroES in B. subtilis [50]. However, a double knockout of tig (the gene encoding trigger factor) and dnaK displays no strong phenotype in B. subtilis [59], in contrast to E. coli, where this combination is synthetically lethal under most conditions [10,19]. This and the comparably strong phenotype of protease mutants in B. subtilis [51,20,21,52] suggests that the B. subtilis protein quality control system appears to be set up differently compared to the E. coli system. How do B. subtilis cells deal with protein aggregates without a ClpB homolog? The first in vivo data on this topic were obtained by examining the fate of in vivo formed puromycyl peptides and overproduction of the heterologous outer membrane protein PorA of Neisseria meningitides [44,29]. In cells overexpressing PorA, large inclusion bodies became visible by phase contrast microscopy, while heat-induced protein aggregates could be visualized by electron microscopy of cryosections. Interestingly, in both cases, the ClpP protease and the Clp ATPases co-localized with the aggregates [44,29, 49]. In addition, the turnover rate of the puromycyl peptides decreased in clpP, clpC, clpE, and clpX mutant strains [44,49]. Later it was also demonstrated that ClpP is required for bulk protein turnover and that the relative amount of aggregated proteins increases in the absence of ClpP [39]. These results suggest that the ClpCP, ClpEP and ClpXP protease complexes may be involved in the degradation of protein aggregates in vivo. Alternatively, the observed effects of the Clp proteases could also be explained by the degradation of misfolded proteins, which are thereby prevented from forming aggregates. Part of the pleiotropic phenotype of the clpP, clpC and clpX mutants [51,20,21,52] can be explained by involvement of these genes in protein quality control. However, some of the observed phenotypes could also be related to the regulatory proteolysis of, i.e. ComK [69] or Spx [53]. Interestingly, it was also shown that ClpCP, together with the adaptor protein MecA, degrades aggregated model proteins

in vivo [62]. In the presence of MecA, ClpC was also able to prevent aggregation, and even disaggregate and refold aggregated model proteins in vitro, comparable to E. coli ClpB [62]. However, aggregate degradation by MecA:ClpCP proceeded much faster than refolding, implying that degradation is more important in vivo. Future experiments will be needed to clarify whether degradation or disaggregation of aggregates prevails in vivo in B. subtilis cells. 3. Adaptor protein-mediated activation of ClpCP Adaptor proteins are known to target substrate proteins for degradation by simultaneous binding to the substrate and accessory domains of the Clp proteins [2,37]. Examples for this tethering mechanism include SspB, which binds to ssrAtagged proteins and mediates proteolysis by ClpXP [46]. Nevertheless, some adaptors such as ClpS from E. coli, which targets N-end rule substrates to ClpAP [12,15], also modulate the activity of the Hsp100/Clp protein they bind to [25]. In vitro experiments on the MecA:ClpC system revealed another level of adaptor modulation of Hsp100/Clp protein activity. A first indication was the observation that purified ClpC from B. subtilis has no detectable in vitro activity in the absence of adaptor proteins [62,33]. Eventually, it could be demonstrated that ClpC is monomeric on its own and that MecA triggers oligomerization of the active ClpC hexamer (Fig. 1) [33]. This is also true for the other two known adaptors, YpbH and McsB (T. Schlothauer, J. Kirstein, K. Turgay, unpublished observation). To date, this unique mechanism could only be demonstrated for B. subtilis ClpC. In contrast, ClpC of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, an organism that does not have a MecA ortholog, displays basal ATPase activity in the absence of adaptors, but is still stimulated by B. subtilis MecA [1]. Interestingly, B. subtilis ClpP is also monomeric in vitro, but oligomerizes in the presence of Clp ATPase hexamers [33]. These data suggest that in vivo, the ClpCP protease can be activated on demand by different adaptor proteins at specific times and places (see section 6 below). 4. Substrate selection by adaptor proteins in B. subtilis The best-characterized adaptor protein of B. subtilis ClpC is MecA, which was identified in a screen for mutations that

promote competence development in rich medium [13]. Later, it was shown that MecA binds and inhibits the transcriptional activator of competence ComK and causes its release from DNA [41,68]. Importantly, MecA also interacts with ClpC, targets ComK for degradation by ClpCP and contributes to the competence switch by interaction with the small protein ComS [69]. In vitro, MecA also targets other substrates, such as aggregated proteins [62] and Spx [53], for degradation. YpbH, a paralog of MecA [57], could contribute to the protein quality control function of ClpC [62,33], but in vivo substrates of this adaptor protein have not been identified. A third adaptor, MscB, targets CtsR, the repressor of the class III heat shock genes (see section 5 below). Recently, YjbH was identified as a ClpX adaptor that targets Spx for degradation [45,18]. ClpXP degrades Spx in the absence of an adaptor [53], but degradation is accelerated by the newly identified adaptor [18], suggesting that YjbH functions more like the E. coli adaptor SspB (see above). Given the variety of ClpC functions in B. subtilis and its strict requirement for adaptor proteins, it is conceivable that unknown adaptors exist. In support of this idea, proteolysis of the substrate SpoIIAB [55] could only be demonstrated in vivo but not in vitro with known adaptor proteins (J. Kirstein & K. Turgay, unpublished observation). The in vivo ClpC substrate MurAA [38] was also degraded by ClpCP in vitro if Histagged ClpC was extracted and purified from amino acid or glucose-starved B. subtilis cells. These data suggest the existence of a starvation-induced ClpC adaptor (I. Kusters & U. ¨ Gerth, personal communication). Also, there are likely more unidentified interaction partners and functions of the known adaptor proteins. For example, McsB, besides its role in the regulation of class III heat shock genes, contributes to the localization of competence proteins [23]. To fully understand the cellular functions of ClpC, it will be interesting to see how different adaptor proteins compete for this ATPase. In one study, it was already demonstrated that phosphorylated McsB displaces MecA from ClpC, giving rise to a titration model of class III heat shock regulation [34] (see below). In contrast to the E. coli adaptors ClpS and SspB, not much is currently known about the molecular details of adaptore substrate interactions in B. subtilis. However, some data are available for MecA. Whereas the C-terminal domain of MecA

interacts with the N-domain and the linker of ClpC, and is sufficient to trigger oligomerization of the active ClpC hexamer [33], the substrate-binding site of MecA resides in its N-terminal part [56]. Recently, two similar MecA recognition sequences were identified near the C-terminus of ComK (FMLYPK) and the N-terminus of ComS (IILYPR), respectively [58]. Peptide competition experiments indicated that both degradation tags bind to the same unidentified site in the N-terminal domain of MecA. The N-domain of Clp ATPases serves as an adaptor proteindocking site. Different Clp ATPases cooperate with different adaptors, i.e. E. coli ClpA binds to ClpS [73] and B. subtilis ClpC forms a complex with MecA [33]. Interestingly, this specificity is achieved even though the overall structures of the ClpA, ClpB and ClpC N-domains are highly similar [73,47]. A recent NMR structure of the ClpC N-domain revealed major differences in the electrostatic surface potential of ClpA and ClpC, explaining their preferences for different adaptor proteins [40]. Interestingly, ClpC of cyanobacteria cooperates both with MecA [1] and two isoforms of ClpS [66]. 5. Regulation of the class III heat shock genes In contrast to E. coli, where most heat-induced genes are under the control of the alternative sigma factor s32[22], B. subtilis uses at least five different mechanisms for heat shock regulation. The class I heat shock genes, which include groEL/ groES and the dnaK operon, are under control of repressor HrcA [50] that binds to so-called CIRCE elements [64]. The large class II regulon is controlled by alternative sigma factor sB and is also induced by other types of stress [34]. Transcription of class III genes, which include the clpC operon, clpE and clpP, is repressed by the binding of CtsR dimers to one or more recognition sequences upstream of the vegetative sA-dependent promoter [43]. Genes upregulated by heat through an uncharacterized mechanism have been termed class IV genes and include htpG, tig, lonA and lonB. A fifth class of heat shock genes connected to extracellular protein folding stress is controlled by the two-component system CssR/CssS [26,6]. The role of ClpC in the regulation of the class III genes shall now be discussed in more detail. The clpC operon consists of the genes encoding ctsR, mcsA, mcsB and clpC. The operon contains both a vegetative sApromoter and a stress-induced sB-promoter. In addition, three ctsR-recognition sites are located downstream of the two promoters and CtsR represses the transcription of the operon [43]. McsB was first identified as a tyrosine kinase [32], but is now known to phosphorylate arginine residues [16]. This makes McsB the first member of a new class of kinases. Together with its co-factor McsA, McsB forms a complex with CtsR, upon which CtsR is phosphorylated close to its DNA binding site [32,16]. Phosporylated CtsR is released from DNA and the class III heat shock regulon is thus derepressed [32]. In addition, phosphorylated McsB acts as an adaptor protein that binds to ClpC and targets CtsR for degradation by ClpCP [34]. This dual inhibitor/adaptor function seems to be

a common theme in B. subtilis: MecA also inhibits ComK, displaces it from DNA and targets it for degradation in a second step [68,69]. Inhibition allows rapid inactivation of a target protein that also occurs when the Clp proteases are occupied by other cellular tasks, while targeting for proteolysis makes the reaction irreversible. McsB can interact with ClpC in two different modes of action. In its unphosphorylated form, the kinase activity of McsB is inhibited by ClpC (Fig. 2) [32]. In its phosphorylated form, however, McsB inhibits CtsR and targets the repressor for degradation. Importantly, MecA in the presence of unfolded protein can disrupt the inhibitory complex of ClpC and McsB. The unfolded substrate is subsequently targeted for degradation by MecA:ClpCP, while McsB is released and allowed to phosphorylate itself and CtsR, which is, in turn, released from DNA and targeted for degradation (Fig. 2). As demonstrated by in vitro competition experiments, phosphorylated McsB can then even displace MecA from ClpCP. The phosphatase YwlE dephosphoryates McsB and CtsR in vitro, suggesting a putative switch-off mechanism of the class III heat shock response. In summary, the molecular switch activating the class III heat shock genes seems to function essentially through competition of two ClpC adaptor proteins. In this system, the double role of ClpC in general and regulatory proteolysis is exploited as a sensor for unfolded proteins, which quickly activates countermeasures in the form of chaperones and proteases [31,34,37]. ClpE, an additional member of the Hsp100/Clp proteins, also takes part in the regulation of class III heat shock genes. ClpE is conserved only in Gram-positive organisms and combines two AAAþ domains with a Zn-containing Nterminal domain, similar to ClpX, and a coiled-coil linker similar to the one found in ClpB and ClpC [8]. The transcription of the clpE gene is controlled by two sA-dependent promoters and five recognition sites for the repressor CtsR. Consequently clpE transcription is repressed by CtsR and strongly induced by heat and folding stress [8]. ClpE contributes to proteolysis of CtsR in vivo, is required for the proper timing of the class III heat shock response and is itself unstable [49]. Additionally, ClpE is involved in protein quality control: it co-localizes with cellular inclusion bodies and a clpE mutant strain shows increased levels of aggregates after heat shock [49]. Preliminary in vitro data suggest that ClpE cooperates with McsB in the degradation of CtsR and that ClpE itself is a ClpCP substrate (J. Kirstein & K. Turgay, unpublished observation). Future experiments will clarify the exact role of ClpE in the class III heat shock switch. 6. Cellular localization of protease-chaperone systems in B. subtilis Over the last couple of years, advances in fluorescent microscopy have made it possible to explore the subcellular localization of proteins in bacteria. An important example of a localizing protease in bacteria is ClpXP in Caulobacter crescentus [48]. In this organism, ClpXP promotes cell cycle

progression by degradation of the regulator CtrA [27]. During swarmer-to-stalked-cell transition, at the exact time of CtrA degradation, ClpXP co-localizes with CtrA at the stalked cell pole [48]. Recently, three independent studies presented data on the localization of GFP-tagged Clp proteases in B. subtilis [30,35,65]. All three publications reported that the protease ClpP, as well as the ATPase ClpX form 1e2 bright foci that preferentially localize to the cell poles and are sometimes also found at mid-cell. Kirstein et al. also followed the outgrowth of a single microcolony harboring GFP-tagged ClpP during several cell division cycles and observed a highly dynamic behavior of the ClpP foci. Clusters did not seem to move substantially within the cell, but formed and disappeared quickly at different locations. In cells that are in the process of dividing, ClpP localizes preferentially to cell division sites, suggesting a function of ClpP in cell division [35]. Simmons et al. observed ClpC and ClpE at the edge of the nucleoid as well as in some bright foci at the cell poles [65], whereas Kirstein et al. [35] reported a localization in polar foci for ClpC and did not detect any ClpE-GFP fluorescence at 30  C. It should be noted that the experiments of Kirstein et al. were performed in LB medium at temperatures of 30 or 50  C, while Simmons et al. used S7 minimal medium at 30 or 42  C. Possibly, the different results are due to these different experimental conditions. After heat shock at 50  C, the

number and intensity of the foci increased. In the study of Kirstein et al., ClpE-GFP also localized in polar foci at 50  C. To observe the localization of ClpP and its ATPases simultaneously, co-localization experiments were performed in all three studies. ClpP clearly co-localized with its three ATPases. However, some of the observed ClpP-YFP foci did not contain the CFP-tagged ATPase, implying that ClpP associates with different ATPases at the same time. To gain a better understanding of the adaptor proteinmediated activity of ClpC, Kirstein et al. were also able to examine the cellular localization of the adaptor McsB and its substrate CtsR. This study demonstrates that the ClpC adaptor protein McsB, as well as the substrate CtsR, localizes in clusters at the cell poles after heat shock. Although co-localization of substrate, adaptor and ClpCP was not directly shown, this implies that regulatory proteolysis of CtsR during the heat shock response may be localized at specific areas in the cell. The localization of McsB seemed to be dependent on phosphorylation, as McsB foci were already visible at 30  C when the phosphatase YwlE was deleted (see above). Importantly, the localization pattern of McsB and CtsR was unchanged in a trapped complex with ClpC, suggesting that the observed foci contain active chaperone-substrate complexes. In an attempt to visualize the Clp proteases in the context of protein quality control, Kirstein et al. showed that ClpP and all three ATPases co-localize to PorA inclusion bodies [29].

It is interesting to note that ClpP still formed polar foci in the absence of FtsZ, indicating that their formation does not depend on cell division. In a DnaA depletion mutant, where cells have no nucleoids, ClpP delocalized, but clusters were quickly reformed after heat shock, even when protein synthesis was inhibited. These results suggest that the clusters might be confined to the pole by nucleoid exclusion, but that assembly of the clusters is independent of the nucleoid. Kain et al. also investigated the localization of ClpP, ClpC and ClpX during sporulation and observed that ClpX and ClpP form a focus in the mother cell, while ClpC is localized dynamically: ClpC delocalized at the onset of sporulation, showed a spiral-like structure in the mother cell during engulfment and appeared as a discrete focus at the forespore membrane at a later stage of sporulation, which finally delocalized. Interestingly, it could also be shown that a ClpC-specific substrate (GFP-LCN) was degraded in the forespore, but not in the mother cell, which implies that ClpC or a ClpC adaptor preferentially exerts its activity in the forespore compartment under these conditions. Finally, Simmons et al. also investigated the localization of other proteases [65]. ClpQ localized to many small foci and its localization did not change during heat shock. Interestingly, the two Lon orthologs of B. subtilis displayed a differential localization pattern: while LonA localized to the nucleoid during vegetative growth and to the forespore membrane during sporulation, LonB was only detectable during sporulation, localized to the forespore membrane early in sporulation and was later homogenously distributed throughout the forespore. In summary, all three studies show a clear pattern of polar localization of the Hsp100/Clp protease systems ClpCP, ClpXP and ClpEP. In sporulating cells, the apparent accumulation of ClpCP and the observed concurrent degradation of a ClpCP substrate in the forespore strengthen the notion that localization of the protease can have a regulatory effect [14,30]. The heatdependent polar localization of adaptor McsB and the substrate as well as localization of protein aggregates implies that regulatory proteolysis in heat shock adaptation and protein quality control also displays a distinct polar localization. This suggests that the subcellular region close to the pole of a bacterial cell could be the preferred place where both regulatory and general proteolysis is taking place. 7. Concluding remarks Recent work has greatly expanded our knowledge of proteolysis in B. subtilis. It could be demonstrated that Clp proteases are intricately involved both in protein quality control and in regulatory proteolysis. These two branches converge in the class III heat shock regulation scheme, where the general proteolysis function of ClpCP is exploited in a regulatory switch, which activates heat shock genes. At the molecular level, ClpCP displays a highly interesting activation mechanism through triggered oligomerization. Finally, Clp proteases display a fascinating localization pattern, the function of which is currently unknown. Major questions for the future are: 1) How do different adaptor proteins activate and compete for ClpCP in order to fulfill the various functions of

this protease? 2) What is the role and mechanism of the observed subcellular localization pattern of protease clusters also in conjunction with different adaptor proteins and substrates? 3) What is the fate of protein aggregates in B. subtilis? Are they solubilized or removed by proteolysis? Acknowledgements Work in the Laboratory of K.T. is supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (SPP 1132, Tu106/6-1). References
