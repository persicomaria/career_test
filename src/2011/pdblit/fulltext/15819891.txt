A structural motif called the small exterior hydrophobic cluster (SEHC) has been proposed to explain the stabilizing effect mediated by solventexposed hydrophobic residues; however, little is known about its biological roles. Unusually, in D5-3-ketosteroid isomerase from Pseudomonas putida biotype B (KSI-PI) Trp92 is exposed to solvent on the protein surface, forming a SEHC with the side-chains of Leu125 and Val127. In order to identify the role of the SEHC in KSI-PI, mutants of those amino acids associated with the SEHC were prepared. The W92A, L125A / V127A, and W92A / L125A / V127A mutations largely decreased the conformational stability, while the L125F / V127F mutation slightly increased the stability, indicating that hydrophobic packing by the SEHC is important in maintaining stability. The crystal structure of W92A revealed that the decreased stability caused by the removal of the bulky side-chain of Trp92 could be attributed to the destabilization of the surface hydrophobic layer consisting of a solvent-exposed b-sheet. Consistent with the structural data, the binding affinities for three different steroids showed that the surface hydrophobic layer stabilized by SEHC is required for KSI-PI to efficiently recognize hydrophobic steroids. Unfolding kinetics based on analysis of the UU value also indicated that the SEHC in the native state was resistant to the unfolding process, despite its solvent-exposed site. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the SEHC plays a key role in the structural integrity that is needed for KSI-PI to stabilize the hydrophobic surface conformation and thereby contributes both to the overall conformational stability and to the binding of hydrophobic steroids in water solution.

Hydrophobic residues are rarely found on the surface of soluble globular proteins because their exclusion from water is favored by the hydrophobic effect [1]. However, stabilizing effects resulting from the introduction of hydrophobic residues on the surface of a

protein have been observed [2­4]. A hydrophobic surface formed by hydrophobic side-chains was found to be associated with the formation and stabilization of the overall b-sheet structure [5]. A structural motif known as the small exterior hydrophobic cluster

(SEHC) was suggested to explain the stabilizing effect of the hydrophobic residues at a solvent-exposed site [6]. In nonsequential b-strands, the SEHC may contribute to conformational stability and folding by organizing a small cluster to fix the b-strands on the protein surface. Such a hydrophobic cluster on the protein surface may be used in the rational design of proteins to increase conformational stability [7,8]. The protein surface is the significant site for interaction of the protein with ligands and substrates [9]. Recent studies have shown that solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues or clusters are important in protein­ ligand interactions in which hydrophobic residues can interact directly with the hydrophobic moieties of ligands at solvent-exposed sites [10,11]. In the case of an enzyme that converts large hydrophobic substrates, molecular recognition between the hydrophobic substrate and the hydrophobic surface of the enzymes is required prior to the enzyme reaction. However, hydrophobic residues that are exposed to solvent for hydrophobic substrate binding may inevitably destabilize protein stability. Interfacial activation via an amphiphilic lid has been proposed to explain the binding and activation of lipids in some lipases [12­14] and in cholesterol oxidase [15­17]. This type of recognition involves the opening of the amphiphilic lid to expose the hydrophobic surface towards the solvent, leading to the binding of lipids or cholesterols. Simultaneously, the lid opening can lead to activation of the enzymes by reorganization of the active site. Steroids are important hydrophobic molecules that play significant roles as hormones or transcription factors together with their receptor proteins. However, the mechanism that determines binding affinity or specificity is poorly understood in steroid-binding or steroid-converting proteins [18]. D5-3-Ketosteroid isomerase (KSI; EC 5.3.3.1) has been reported to contain hydrophobic residues at solvent-exposed sites [19]. KSI catalyzes a reaction from

D5-3-ketosteroids to D4-3-ketosteroids at a diffusioncontrolled limit (Scheme 1) [20,21]. In animals, this reaction is essential for the synthesis of steroid hormones from cholesterol. Two KSIs from different bacteria ­ Pseudomonas putida biotype B and Comamonas testosteroni ­ have been studied extensively as prototypes in order to understand, in greater detail, the catalytic mechanism of the allylic rearrangement [21­28]. X-ray crystal structures [19,29] and the NMR solution structure [30] of KSI have revealed that this protein folds into a six-stranded b-sheet and three a-helices in each monomer (Fig. 1A). One of the most noticeable features of KSI from P. putida (KSI-PI) is that the bulky side-chain of Trp92 forms a hydrophobic cluster with the aliphatic side-chains of Leu125 and Val127 on the surface. Leu125 and Val127 are located close to the C-terminal end, and the hydrophobic cluster is located at the center of three b-strands (B4, B5 and B7) that are exposed to solvent (Fig. 1B) [19]. Interestingly, this SEHC is located on top of the conical cleft of the active site in KSI-PI. Even though KSIPI exposes the hydrophobic residues to solvent, it exhibits high thermodynamic stability (a DGUH2 O value of 24 kcalÆmol)1) and is highly soluble, without aggregation at high concentration [31,32]. In this study, the SEHC in KSI-PI was characterized to identify its roles in conformational stability and steroid binding. The SEHC was perturbed by sitedirected mutagenesis in order to investigate the mutational effects on catalysis, stability, unfolding and binding affinity of KSI-PI. The crystal structure of W92A in complex with d-1,3­5(10),6,8-estrapentaen-3° ol-17-one (d-equilenin), determined at 2.1 A resolution, provided a structural basis for understanding the roles of the SEHC. Our studies demonstrate that the SEHC in KSI-PI is required to stabilize the surface conformation of solvent-exposed b-strands, thereby contributing to the overall conformational stability and the binding affinity of steroids.

To investigate the mutational effects of W92A, L125A / V127A, W92A / L125A / V127A, and L125F / V127F on the catalytic parameters, the kcat and KM values of the mutant KSI-PIs were determined using 5-androstene-3,17-dione (5-AND) as a substrate (Table 1). The removal or addition of hydrophobic moieties from the SEHC affected the KM more than the kcat. The kcat values decreased by 1.6-, 1.6-, 1.7and 1.2-fold for W92A, L125A / V127A, W92A / L125A / V127A and L125F / V127F while the KM values increased by 1.9-, 2.7-, 2.3- and 1.5-fold, respectively, indicating that the SEHC could affect the substratebinding step as well as the catalytic step in the enzyme reaction. Effect of mutations on conformational stability The unfolding free-energy change, DGU, was determined by monitoring the molar ellipticity of the proteins at 222 nm upon changing the urea concentration at 25 °C. The transition curves were normalized by assuming that ellipticities for the native and unfolded state can be extrapolated linearly into the transition zone and nicely fitted to a two-state transition model (Fig. 2). By applying the two-state transition model, the values of DGUH2 O , m, and DDGU for wild-type (WT) and mutant enzymes were obtained (Table 2). Removal of hydrophobic moieties from the SEHC decreased the DGUH2 O values by 3.1 and 4.2 kcalÆmol)1

the proteins are more than 95% unfolded at equilibrium, straight lines were obtained (Fig. 3). The unfolding rates of W92A, L125A / V127A and W92A / L125A / V127A were faster than that of the WT enzyme. However, the unfolding rate of L125F / V127F was slower than that of the WT enzyme, suggesting that the hydrophobic moieties may play a role during the unfolding process. The free-energy change of the unfolding transition state was assessed from the unfolding rate constants (Table 3). Analyses of the transition-state interaction The hydrophobic interaction of the SEHC during the unfolding process was investigated by UU value analysis, according to the method described previously [33]. The UU value can range from 0 to 1. A high UU value implies that the target region is exposed to solvent in the transition state to the same extent as in the unfolded state, while a low UU value implies that the interaction energies in the transition states and folded states are similar. The W92A, L125A / V127A and W92A / L125A / V127A mutants gave UU values of 0.451, 0.393 and 0.500, respectively, indicating that 50.0­60.7% of the noncovalent interaction energy is maintained in the transition state for the hydrophobic cluster (Table 3). However, the L125F / V127F mutant had a relatively high UU value of 0.777. The ratio of mUà / mU has been reported to indicate the increase in solvent exposure of the transition state relative to the native state [34]. The mUà / mU values of the WT enzyme were determined to be 0.147, indicating that the solvent accessibility of the transition state is very similar to that of the native state. Effect of mutations on d-equilenin binding d-Equilenin has a maximum emission peak at 363 nm when excited at 335 nm. Addition of the enzyme

However, the L125F / V127F mutation of the SEHC increased the DGUH2 O value by 0.9 kcalÆmol)1, while the L125A / V127A mutation of the SEHC decreased the DGUH2 O value by 3.3 kcalÆmol)1. These results indicate that the SEHC formed by Trp92, Leu125 and Val127 contributes to the conformational stability.

Effect of mutations on 17b-hydroxy-4-estren3-one (19-nortestosterone) binding The KD value for 19-nortestosterone was determined by analyzing the changes in UV absorption spectra upon binding 19-nortestosterone to the enzyme. From spectral titration at various steroid concentrations, the KD value of 19-nortestosterone was obtained for each enzyme according to the relationship given in Eqn (12). The spectral titration for the enzymes is shown in Fig. 5 and the calculated KD values are listed in Table 4. The KD value was determined to be 7.28 lm for the WT enzyme. The KD values for W92A, L125A / V127A and W92A / L125A / V127A were increased by 2.81-, 5.97- and 2.08-fold, respectively, indicating that the SEHC could affect the affinity towards 19-nortestosterone. The 1.18-fold increased KD of L125F / V127F suggests that the increased bulkiness of the phenylalanines did not drastically interfere with steroid binding. Structural analysis of W92A To explain the decreased stability and the increased KD values of W92A towards steroids on a structural basis, the crystal structure of W92A was determined at ° 2.1 A resolution.

Role of small exterior hydrophobic cluster in KSI

The superimposition and drawing were carried out by using the program SWISS-PDB VIEWER, Version 3.7 [49].

Discussion
Our study was intended to identify the role of the SEHC (comprising Trp92, Leu125 and Val127) in KSI-PI for conformational stability and steroid binding. The DGUH2 O values decreased significantly for all the mutants in which the hydrophobic residue of the SEHC was replaced with alanine (W92A, L125A / V127A and W92A / L125A / V127A). However, when the hydrophobicity in the SEHC was increased by substituting leucine and valine with phenylalanines, the DGUH2 O value increased. These results indicate that the SEHC might improve the overall stability by stabilizing the solvent-exposed b-sheet constituting the surface hydrophobic layer. The mutational study on steroid-binding affinity also revealed that the SEHC plays a role in efficient steroid binding. The crystal structure of W92A showed that the W92A mutation disrupts the solvent-exposed b-sheet. Contribution of the SEHC to conformational stability The hydrophobic interaction in the SEHC of KSI-PI was perturbed by replacing the hydrophobic residues with amino acids having smaller or larger hydrophobic side-chains. The 3.1 kcalÆmol)1 decrease in thermodynamic stability of W92A is noteworthy given that amino acid substitution of a surface residue generally does not affect the stability of a protein [35­38]. The decreased stability of L125A / V127A and increased stability of L125F / V127F suggest that the hydrophobic packing of the SEHC is important for the conformational stability of KSI-PI. The stability of L125A / V127A was decreased by 0.9 kcalÆmol)1 upon the additional mutation of W92A. This additional mutaFEBS Journal 272 (2005) 1999­2011 ª 2005 FEBS

tion could be expected to stabilize the protein because the hydrophobic Trp92 might not be stable in L125A / V127A. The marginal decrease of the stability suggested that Trp92 in L125A / V127A could interact with other nearby hydrophobic moieties as a result of the slight change of local conformation. In previous studies, the b-sheet structure underneath the hydrophobic layer of the thermolysin-like neutral protease of Bacillus stearothermophilus was found to be stabilized by utilizing a hydrophobic residue at the solventexposed site [3], and a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of neutral protease of B. subtilis could stabilize the protease [2]. Hence, the stabilizing effects of KSIPI may originate from hydrophobic interaction mediated by the SEHC on the protein surface. Hydrophobic clusters or residues have sometimes been found on the surface of b-sheet structure proteins [5,39]. The SEHC in KSI-PI is located on the center of three b-strands (B4, B5 and B7) that are exposed to solvent. Recent studies on the b-sheet structure suggested that a hydrophobic shield protecting the b-sheet structure against invading water molecules could be required to stabilize solvent-exposed b-sheets [2,4,40]. Invading water is critically related to the kinetic stability of the protein as protein unfolding can be initiated from the solvent-exposed region by the invasion of water. Consistent with this notion, the unfolding rate constant showed a large increase of 133-fold in W92A / L125A / V127A compared with the WT enzyme upon increasing the urea concentration up to 7 m. In the crystal structure of W92A, the deletion of the bulky indole ring of Trp92 significantly perturbed the solvent-exposed b-sheet. Given that backbone chain movement by a single amino acid substitution, especially in the case of a surface residue, has rarely been found, the structural perturbation induced by the W92A mutation is notable. In view of the structural change in W92A at the solvent-exposed b-sheet, we may assume that the decreased stability of W92A originates from the replacement of the bulky hydrophobic moiety of tryptophan, resulting in increased access of the invading water molecules to the b-sheet, ultimately leading to the acceleration of protein unfolding. The hydrophobic interaction of the SEHC in KSI-PI seems to be partially maintained in the transition state during the unfolding process, as judged by the UU values (Table 3). Solvent-exposed regions, including loops, usually exhibit high UU values, close to 1, because the exposed region is usually exposed to solvent in the transition state for the folding process [33,41]. However, the UU values of W92A, L125A / V127A and W92A / L125A / V127A were found to be below 0.5, indicating that over 50% of the hydrophobic inter2005

action was maintained in the transition state during the unfolding process. The high UU value of L125F / V127F seems to be a result of the increased bulkiness caused by the introduced phenyl rings. In this case, the UU value does not seem to properly represent the status of the transition state in folding, because adding new functional groups can make other extraneous interactions and cause steric effects in the protein [33,41]. Our results indicate that the SEHC in KSI-PI contributes to the resistance to unfolding, despite its solvent-exposed site. Analysis of the UU value also supports that the SEHC is required to stabilize the surface conformation in KSI-PI, suggesting that the SEHC can play an important role in the unfolding process in concert with the hydrophobic core. Contribution of the SEHC to recognition of steroids Based on the crystal structure, the SEHC comprising Trp92, Leu125 and Val127 is located on the top of the hydrophobic layer of the steroid-binding pocket in KSI-PI (Fig. 1B). The steroid-binding pocket is lined with hydrophobic residues, which contribute to the tight binding of hydrophobic steroids [19]. The affinity of KSI-PI towards steroids was assessed by utilizing two steroids: d-equilenin and 19-nortestosterone [42]. KD values for both steroids increased by over twofold in all the mutants with decreased hydrophobicity in the SEHC (i.e. W92A, L125A / V127A and W92A / L125A / V127A). Consistent with the increased KD values in those mutants, the KM values of 5-AND increased, indicating that the SEHC contributes to the steroid binding in KSI-PI. The decrease of hydrophobicity in the SEHC, destabilizing the overall hydrophobic layer along the binding site of the steroid, could lead to a decrease in affinity towards the steroids 5-AND, 19-nortestosterone and d-equilenin. In the case of L125A / V127A, the drastic decrease in the affinity to steroids could be a result of disruption of the SEHC, as Trp92 cannot form a hydrophobic cluster without the aliphatic side-chains of Leu125 and Val127. In L125F / V127F, the slight increase in KD and KM values suggests that replacing leucine and valine with phenylalanines cannot increase the binding affinity of steroids. The solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues may contribute to hydrophobic substrate- or ligand-binding to the protein. It was reported that the hydrophobic surface made by hydrophobic residues could be important for the binding of phospholipids, vitamin D, lipid and cholesterol to their respective proteins. These observations, as well as ours, suggest that solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues seem to interact with their
2006

ligands or substrates on the protein surface in the initial binding step. Even if the hydrophobic residues constituting the SEHC do not directly bind steroids, as judged by the crystal structure of KSI-PI in complex with d-equilenin (Fig. 1B), the SEHC seems to indirectly affect the binding process of steroids by stabilizing the surface hydrophobic layer or perhaps by guiding hydrophobic steroids at the top of the hydrophobic cleft. The bound mode of the steroid in both KSI-PI and W92A is almost identical based on the X-ray crystal data, supporting the fact that the SEHC might play a role in the initial recognition of hydrophobic steroids rather than the binding itself. In conclusion, the mutational studies on the role of the SEHC in KSI-PI demonstrate that the SEHC contributes not only to conformational stability, but also to the binding affinity of steroids, by stabilizing the hydrophobic surface conformation. Our results suggest that the SEHC stabilizes the hydrophobic layer by connecting the solvent-exposed b-strands and helps to bind hydrophobic steroids. It remains to be investigated whether SEHC, as a structural motif, can contribute to the conformational stability or the binding of hydrophobic ligands in other proteins.

crystallography using the program molmol, 2 k2 [44] according to the method described previously [45]. The ° probe radius for the calculation was 1.4 A.

Equilibrium unfolding
Unfolding of the protein was assessed by measuring the molar ellipticity at different urea concentrations. Protein (15 lm) was incubated for at least 48 h in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and different concentrations (0­8 m) of urea. A cuvette with a 0.2 cm path length was used for all CD spectral measurements. The ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded and analyzed. The changes in the optical properties of the protein were compared by normalizing each transition curve with the apparent fraction of the unfolded form, FU, which was obtained by Eqn (1): FU ¼ ðYN À YÞ=ðYN À YU Þ; ð1Þ

Expression and purification of the KSI-PI proteins
WT and mutant KSI-PIs were overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) utilizing pKK223-3, an expression vector containing the respective KSI-PI gene, and purified by deoxycholate affinity chromatography and Superose 12 gel filtration chromatography, as described previously [26]. The purity of the protein was confirmed by the presence of a single band on an SDS / PAGE gel stained with Coomassie blue. The protein concentration was determined by utilizing the difference extinction coefficient between tyrosinate and tyrosine at 295 nm, as described previously [43]. The accuracy of the protein concentration was confirmed by the quantitative analysis of the bands on SDS / PAGE by use of an imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; GS-700) and a software program (molecular analyst / PC).

where Y is the observed molar ellipticity at a given urea concentration, and YN and YU are the observed values for the native and unfolded forms, respectively, at the same denaturant concentration. Linear extrapolations from these baselines were made to estimate YN and YU in the transition region. The equilibrium constant (KU) and freeenergy change (DGU) for denaturation were determined, according to a two-state model of denaturation, by Eqns (2) and (3): KU ¼ 2PT Á ½FU2 =ð1 À FU Þ ð2Þ

Steady-state kinetic analysis
Catalytic activities of the purified enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically using 5-AND as a substrate, according to the procedure previously described [42]. Various amounts of the substrate dissolved in methanol were added to a reaction buffer containing 34 mm potassium phosphate and 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. The concentrations of 5-AND used were 12, 35, 58, 82 and 116 lm. The final concentration of methanol was 3.3% (v / v). The initial reaction rate was obtained within 1 or 2 min after the initiation of the enzymatic reaction. The fraction of the substrate converted to the product was below 10% of the substrate applied to the reaction mixture. The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 248 nm by using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan; UV-2501 PC). kcat and KM values were determined by utilizing Lineweaver­Burk reciprocal plots.

Kinetic analysis of unfolding
The unfolding kinetic experiments for WT and mutant KSI-PIs were performed by use of a spectrofluorometer (Shimadzu RF5000) equipped with a thermostatically controlled cell holder. The protein was incubated in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Unfolding reactions were initiated by diluting the protein sample 20-fold into the same buffer with various concentrations of urea at 25 °C. The dead time of manual mixing was % 10 s. The kinetics for unfolding was monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 325 nm after excitation at 285 nm. The final protein concentration was 15 lm. The rate constants for unfolding at each urea concentration were obtained by fitting the data to Eqn (6): Ft ¼ F1 þ R½Fi Á expðÀki Á tÞ; ð6Þ

UU ¼ DDGz =DDGU ¼ ðDGF À DGz Þ=ðDGF À DGsolv Þ; U ð10Þ where DGF is the difference of the noncovalent interaction energy between WT and mutant enzymes in the folded states, DGà the difference in the transition states and DGsolv the difference in the unfolded states.

Determination of KD for d-equilenin
Fluorescence quenching upon the binding of equilenin to the enzyme was used to determine the dissociation constant, KD, as described previously [42]. Fluorescence measurements were carried out at 25 °C by using a spectroflurometer (Shimadzu, RF5000) in a buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate and 5% (v / v) methanol at pH 7.0. A total of 5 lL of the stock solution of d-equilenin was added to 3.0 mL of the buffer, giving a final concentration of 3 lm. Titrations were carried out by adding 6 lL of the enzyme solution to give a total volume of 72 lL. After adding the enzyme, the emission spectrum was scanned from 345 nm to 450 nm with an excitation wavelength at 335 nm. After the spectral change caused by the dilution had been corrected, the fluorescence of d-equilenin at the emission maximum (363 nm) for each enzyme concentration was used to calculate the KD for d-equilenin by nonlinear least-squares fitting, according to Eqn (11), by using the kaleidagraph program: Et ¼ ðF0 À FÞfKD =ðF À F1 Þ þ ½equilenin=ðF0 À F1 Þg; ð11Þ where Et is the concentration of total enzyme in the solution, F is the fluorescence intensity, F0 is the intensity in the absence of enzyme and F1 is the intensity extrapolated to infinite enzyme concentration. A binding stoichiometry of 1 per subunit was assumed.

where Ft and F1 are the amplitudes at time t and at the final state, Fi is the amplitude of the kinetic phase and ki is the rate constant for unfolding. Data fitting was carried out by using the kaleidagraph program. The unfolding rate constants, kU, obtained at different urea concentrations, were then analyzed according to Eqn (7), as described [41]: ln kU ¼ ln kUH2 O þ mU z Á ½urea; ð7Þ

where kUH2 O is the unfolding rate constant in the absence of urea and mUà the dependence of the unfolding rate constant on urea concentration. The free energy of activation for the unfolding of KSI-PI was obtained by Eqn (8): DGz ¼ DGUH2 Oz À mU z Á ½urea; U ð8Þ

where DGUH2 O à is the free-energy change for the unfolding transition state in the absence of urea, and mUà represents a measure of the DGUà dependence on urea concentration. DGUà was obtained from the relationship, DGUà ¼ RTln(kBT / h) ­ lnkU, where kB, T and h are the Boltzman constant, the experimental temperature and the Plank constant, respectively.

Determination of KD for 19-nortestosterone
The KD for 19-nortestosterone was determined by UV absorption spectrometry, as described previously [42]. The measurements were carried out at 25 °C, using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2501 PC), in an 1.0 cm quartz cuvette with a total volume of 1 mL. The spectra from 320 to 220 nm were obtained in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris / HCl and 100 mm sodium chloride at pH 7.0. 19-Nortestosterone was added to the enzyme from a 10 mm stock solution containing 20% (v / v) methanol. The absorption change caused by the increased volume was corrected. Difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectra of total steroid and total enzyme from those of their mixture. The changes in absorption (DA) at the respective absorption maxima in the difference spectra were measured as a function of steroid concentration. KD values were determined by fitting the DA plots, with

Analysis of the FU value
The changes in free energy of activation for unfolding, DDGUà, between WT and mutant proteins were obtained by Eqn (9): DDGUz ¼ DGUzm À DGUz ð9Þ

where DGUà and DGUàm are the free-energy changes of activation for the unfolding of WT and mutant proteins, respectively. The F value of unfolding, FU, is the ratio of the free-energy change determined from the kinetic data to that determined from the urea equilibrium unfolding experiment, as described in Eqn (10):

where KD represents the dissociation constant, Et the concentration of total enzyme, St the concentration of total steroid and DAmax the maximal change in absorption observed as St approaches infinity. A binding stoichiometry of 1 per subunit was assumed.

Crystallization and structure determination of W92A
The crystals of W92A were obtained by co-crystallizing with a small amount of d-equilenin dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. A total of 30 mm d-equilenin solution was mixed with 1 mm enzyme solution. Saturated d-equilenin was ensured by the presence of white precipitates formed immediately after the mixing. Crystals of W92A were grown in a solution containing 0.2 m magnesium acetate, 20% (w / v) PEG 8000 and 0.1 m sodium carcodylate, pH 6.5, by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion at 25 °C. Before cryocooling, crystals were briefly immersed in the same precipitant solution containing 10­15% (v / v) glycerol. All diffraction data were collected at 100 K on the beamline 6B of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea). Data reduction, merging and scaling were carried out using the programs denzo and scalepack, as described previously [47]. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement program cns, using the atomic coordinates of the WT enzyme (PDB code, 4TSU). Further refinement was carried out by using the program cns [48].
