Despite the importance of hydration around DNA in the understanding of its conformation and interactions with other molecules in many biological processes, only limited atomic resolution information is available. Crystal-engineering techniques, which were originally developed to mimic DNA base triplets in a crystal lattice, also eliminate the rotational disorder of oligonucleotides around their helical axis and thereby enhance the resolution of the structure analysis. The low-temperature crystal structure of the synthetic DNA decamer d(GGCCAATTGG) has been determined at atomic Ê resolution (1.15 A) using 17 700 re¯ections and the highly organized hydration patterns in both grooves have been characterized. The narrow d(AATT) minor groove is occupied by an `extended hydration spine' alternately bridging base pairs and phosphate O1P atoms of opposite strands, while a distinctive pattern of parallel water ribbons is observed in the major groove. This analysis provides structural insight into the correlation found between narrow minor-groove width and occurrence of the BI conformation and can be used to design new minor-groove binders. By their location between adjacent helices, two fully hydrated magnesium ions further stabilize the crystal packing. The structure also provides details of the hydration and conformation of GÁGC triple helices.

1. Introduction
The solvent environment plays an important role in the conformation of biological macromolecules. In the case of DNA, a high relative humidity favours the B form, while reduced humidity or increased ionic strength promote conformational transitions to, depending on the sequence, A-, C-, D- and Z-DNA. The hydration around DNA double helices is often depicted as being organized in two regions (Saenger, 1984). The ®rst region is impermeable to cations and in close contact with the polyelectrolyte molecule; the second region is bulk solvent. The two regions are separated by a transition zone with only partial ordering, which contains water molecules and ions fast exchanging with the bulksolvent region. DNA has many potential hydration sites: the functional groups of the bases facing the grooves and the phosphate and sugar O atoms. In total, about 20 water molecules per nucleotide comprise the primary hydration shell, of which, as indicated by infrared spectroscopy (Falk et al., 1970), about ten waters are in direct contact with DNA. The number of experimental methods suitable for determining the detailed water structure around biological macromolecules is only small. For example, high-de®nition NMR studies yield inforVlieghe et al.

mation on the residence time of interacting water molecules Ê within about 4 A of protein or nucleic acid atoms, but in most cases an exact localization of these solvent molecules is not possible (Kochoyan & Leroy, 1995). Information about the positions of water molecules can be obtained using X-ray crystallography. Depending on the resolution of the diffraction pattern and the water content of the crystals, most of the water molecules in the ®rst region can be identi®ed. The ®rst B-DNA crystal structure of d(CGCGAATTCGCG), containing the EcoRI restriction site embedded in an alternating CG matrix, showed 72 water molecules per dodecamer duplex (Drew & Dickerson, 1981). This number represents only 17% of the 430 solvent molecules estimated from the crystal density. However, the ®rst hydration region plays a key role in understanding the conformation of nucleic acids and the mechanisms by which they interact with other molecules. The remaining solvent molecules are too disordered to be identi®ed in the electron-density maps. In the past, it was common practice to neglect the bulk-solvent contribution by discarding the very low order re¯ection data, but now most macromolecular re®nement programs include appropriate corrections for the diffuse solvent. Based on the oligonucleotide crystal structures present in the Nucleic Acid Database (Berman et al., 1992), the distribution of water molecules around DNA has been quanti®ed. Using Fourier transform techniques, average building blocks, which represent bases with ®rst hydration shell waters at average positions, have been proposed and used to predict hydration sites for selected oligonucleotides (Schneider et al., 1993). Recently, this study has been extended to the analysis of distributions of metal ions and water around the phosphate group in organic phosphates deposited in the Cambridge Structural Database (Allen & Kennard, 1993a,b). An asymmetric monodentate position, in which the cation or water only binds to one of the two negatively charged O atoms of the phosphate group, is preferred to a symmetric bidentate position between the two O atoms (Schneider & Kabelac, 1998). The precise determination of the ®rst hydration region by X-ray methods requires high-resolution diffraction data. In most cases (Berman et al., 1992), the resolution of B-DNA oligonucleotide crystal structures varies between 1.4 and Ê 2.5 A. An important reason for atomic resolution not being observable for oligonucleotide structures is the rotational disorder of the helices in the crystal lattice. With decreasing distance between neighbouring helices, the rotational disorder reduces and will enhance the resolution that can be obtained. This was observed in the monoclinic structure of d(CCAACITTGG), where the phosphate backbones of one column of helices ®t into the grooves of its neighbours, resulting in the Ê highest resolution so far observed (1.3 A) for longer B-DNA fragments (Lipanov et al., 1993). We have recently shown (Van Meervelt et al., 1995, Vlieghe et al., 1996a,b) that crystalengineering techniques used to determine the structure of triple-helical fragments result in a very tight crystal packing for the decamer d(GGCCAATTGG) (Fig. 1). The interaction of unpaired 5H -guanine bases G11 and G12 with adjacent duplexes generates in®nitely extending columns through the formation of parallel (GÁGC)2 triple-helix fragments. The relative position and orientation of these columns is ®xed by the formation of antiparallel (GÁGC)2 triple-helix fragments involving interaction of G1 and G2 in the major grooves of neighbouring columns. This triplex formation leads to a very stable crystal lattice in which an B-DNA AATT sequence is held in suspension (see Fig. 1 of Vlieghe et al., 1996b), Ê suggesting that the previously obtained 2.0 A resolution might not be the limit. Here, we present the analysis of the same sequence and its solvent network in both grooves at an atomic Ê resolution of 1.15 A obtained using a stronger synchrotron source in combination with ¯ash-cooling techniques. An `extended hydration spine' in the minor groove with watermediated inter-strand and intra-strand phosphate±phosphate contacts, and a distinctive pattern of parallel water ribbons in the major groove are described.

2. Methods
2.1. Crystallization

The puri®ed oligonucleotide d(GGCCAATTGG) was purchased from the Oswel DNA Service (University of Southampton, England). The oligomer was crystallized at 289 K in space group P212121 (unit-cell parameters a = 26.11, Ê b = 36.46, c = 52.56 A) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit as previously described (Vlieghe et al., 1996b), using the following concentrations: [oligonucleotide] = 0.41 mM, [buffer] = 10.6 mM (pH = 6), [MgCl2] = 42.6 mM, [MPD] = 4.3% and [spermine] = 0.22 mM against a 40% MPD reservoir (10 ml). Similar crystals with typical dimensions of 0.5 Â 0.2 Â 0.02 mm were obtained, but over a period of 7 d instead of 2 d.

In contrast to the previous data collection (Vlieghe et al., 1996b), intensity data were collected at a temperature of 120 K on the 180 mm MAR Research imaging-plate detector at beamline 5.2R of the synchrotron Elettra at Trieste Ê (! = 1.000 A) using cryo-cooling techniques. The maximum Ê resolution was limited to 1.15 A owing to the detector dimensions and wavelength at the beamline. Two datacollection runs at different resolution limits were performed to correctly address the strongest re¯ections; for the ®rst run at a Ê resolution of 1.15 A (crystal-to-detector distance 80 mm), the total oscillation range was 90 in steps of 1 ; the second run of 36 images with an individual oscillation angle of 2.5 was Ê achieved at 1.6 A resolution (crystal-to-detector distance = 122 mm). The data set was processed with DENZO

The atom-positional estimated standard deviations obtained from a ®nal cycle of full-matrix least-squares Ê re®nement (Sheldrick, 1996) range from 0.02±0.18 A and were used to obtain estimated standard deviations on all geometric Ê parameters.

For the torsion angles, the lowest e.s.d. values are found for the bases and the highest values for the phosphates. A clear correlation is found between the e.s.d. value and the quality of the electron-density map. Double conformations also show higher e.s.d. values.

2.3. Structure re®nement

Re®nement on all 17 700 unique F2 using SHELXL93 (Sheldrick, 1993) reduced the R factor to 0.167 for 16 727 Ê observed re¯ections [F > 4'(F)] between 10 and 1.15 A (wR2 = 0.423) including 116 water molecules and two Mg2+ ions. Most of the bonds (1,2 distances) and angles (1,3 distances) were restrained to be approximately equal without applying ®xed values (the SADI option in SHELXL). The criteria for identi®cation of solvent atoms were that a well shaped peak in the Fo À Fc map greater than 2' in height was Ê within 2.3±3.3 A of plausible hydrogen-bonding partners and that well shaped peaks in the 2Fo À Fc maps, reasonable Ê geometry and acceptable temperature factors (<45 A2) were obtained upon subsequent re®nement. Bases were labelled G1 to G10 in the 5H to 3H direction on strand 1 and G11 to G20 on strand 2. A double conformation was re®ned for backbone atoms C2H , C3H and O3H for residue A16 and phosphate group T17 (population factor of 0.61 for ®rst set). One water molecule was re®ned with this same population parameter, as it only has reasonable contacts to the ®rst conformation. All atoms were re®ned anisotropically; however, restraints on the anisotropic displacement parameters were necessary: for all DNA atoms, the anisotropic displacement components of two atoms along the line joining them and of spatially adjacent atoms were restrained to be equal and 46 solvent and 21 DNA atoms were also restrained to be approximately isotropic. Anisotropic re®nement of the double helix and the solvent molecules lowered the R factor by 0.033 and 0.018, respectively. The average equivalent temperature factor for each Ê residue varies from 9.1 to 15.4 A2, which is close to the overall Ê 2 derived from the Wilson plot. H temperature factor of 9.0 A atoms were placed at calculated positions and re®ned in the riding mode with ®xed isotropic temperature factors 1.2 times the Ueq of their parent atom. The parameters g (1.015) and U (2.748) were used to model diffuse solvent by Babinet's principle (Moews & Kretsinger, 1975). Using all low-resoluActa Cryst. (1999). D55, 1495±1502

The program NEWHELIX93 was used for calculation of the helical parameters and the program Curves (Lavery & Sklenar, 1989) was used for the calculation of groove dimensions and sugar puckering. All calculations have been performed with the backbone conformation with the highest occupancy. Figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994) and BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1997).

3. Results
3.1. Overall features of the duplex

The eight base-pair fragment d(CCAATTGG) adopts a classical B-DNA double helix with a helical twist of 35.2 , a Ê rise of 3.42 A, 10.2 residues per turn and a diameter of about Ê Ê 19.6 A. The superposition of the 1.15 and the 2.0 A structures Ê shows a root-mean-square deviation of 0.49 A, with closest similarity for the bases (r.m.s. deviation ranging from 0.16 to Ê Ê 0.50 A), followed by the sugar rings (0.20±0.71 A) and least Ê similarity for the phosphate groups (0.27 to À2.02 A), with the phosphate groups of residues C13 and A16 deviating most Ê (2.02 and 1.60 A, respectively); this is the same order as usually found for the average temperature factors (Bbases < Bsugars < Bphosphates). The atomic resolution has made it possible to interpret peaks in the difference electron-density maps close to atoms C2H , C3H and O3H of residue A16 and to the phosphate group T17 as a double backbone conformation (with a population parameter of 0.39 for the second conformation). Table 2 gives the sugar±phosphate backbone angles, glycosyl torsion angles and pseudorotation phase angles. The ¯exibility of the sugar conformation in B-DNA is illustrated by the pseudorotation phase angle ranging from 96.3 (6) (O4H -endo) to 179.8 (3) (C2H -endo). However, residues C3 and C13 show a C3H -endo sugar-puckering mode, a feature which may be related to the triplex formation. The torsion angles , ,  and  are in their usual (À)-gauche, trans, (+)-gauche and (+)-anticlinal ranges, respectively. Exceptions are found in the backbone of the triple-helical fragments for the  angle of C13 [(+)-synclinal], the  angle of G1, C3 and

the BII free central AATT region (Dickerson, 1990). The decamer d(GGCCAATTGG) (subsequently referred to as 10-mer) contains the same central AATT tetramer as the dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) (subsequently referred to as 12-mer) studied in detail by Dickerson and coworkers (Drew & Dickerson, 1981). Minor-groove widths for 12-mer and 10-mer sequences are very similar, indicating that the triplex formation does not change the minor-groove characteristics (Fig. 2).

C13 (trans) and the  angle of C3, C13 [(+)-synclinal] and are related to the triplex formation. The twisting away of residues G1 and G2 is re¯ected by changes in torsion angles  and , but mainly in  of residue G3. The unusual torsion angles for C13 were not previously observed in the lower resolution structure (Vlieghe et al., 1996b). However, these torsion angles Ê are compatible with the electron-density maps at 2.0 A resoÊ lution. This illustrates that electron-density maps at 2.0 A resolution still can contain some ambiguity with respect to backbone conformations. The glycosidic conformations are all (À)-anticlinal, with an average torsion angle 1 = À112 . Only two phosphate groups (P5 and P13) adopt the BII conformation, which is in agreement with the narrow minor groove in

Ê The most striking difference from the 2.0 A resolution structure is seen in the hydration of the B-DNA fragment. In total, 116 water molecules and 2 Mg2+ ions were located Ê (compared with 44 water molecules for the 2.0 A resolution structure), of which 85 are in the ®rst coordination shell. The two Mg(H2O)2 clusters bridge three adjacent symmetry6 related backbone strands, further stabilizing the crystal lattice and causing temperature factors to be lower for this region. Each phosphate group is individually hydrated by an average of 3.2 molecules. On average, the adenine and thymine bases not involved in triplet formation have 2.25 and 2.00 water Ê molecules per base within 3.20 A, respectively, which is signi®cantly more than the 1.47 and 0.91, respectively, found in a systematic analysis of 28 crystal structures of oligonucleotides (Schneider et al., 1993). The major-groove region contains 2±3 water molecules directly hydrogen bonded to the bases per base pair. These solvent molecules lie in the base-pair plane, linking the polar atoms of adjacent bases (Fig. 3). In the backbone strand with the lowest temperature factors, the O2P atoms are heavily hydrated, forming intrastrand phosphate bridges which are further connected to the base-associated hydration.

factors for the water molecules bridging the phosphate groups Ê average at 19.0 A2. At one end, no water-mediated contact between P7 and P20 is observed despite the short interstrand phosphate±phosphate distance. Instead, this region of the minor groove displays two water ribbons which do not bridge base atoms to sugar O4H atoms, as described for wide B-DNA Â minor grooves (Prive et al., 1987), but form intrastrand phosphate bridges. As this part of the helix is involved in the triple-helix formation, it is dif®cult to give an exact explanation for this double ribbon. At the end of the spine, the hydration network breaks up into an irregular pattern.
3.3. Triple-helix fragments

As in the 12-mer, the narrow central region of the minor groove is occupied at the bottom by a zigzag hydration spine (Fig. 4; water molecules coloured in red). In the current structure, this spine further extends towards the ¯anking phosphate groups in the minor-groove walls. Depending on the minor-groove width, two or three water molecules bridge the phosphate O1P atoms of opposite strands. The nine water molecules of the base-associated hydration spine alternatingly bridge base pairs and phosphate groups, and are located closer to strand 1 than to strand 2. The average temperature factor Ê for these water molecules is 15.5 A2, which is lower than the Ê average for all water molecules (21.2 A2). The temperature

The best-de®ned regions in the electron-density maps are found for both triple-helix parts (Fig. 5). The lowest temperature factors are also observed in these regions, illustrating the importance of triplet formation in the stabilization of the crystal lattice. Compared with the lower resolution structure determination, the geometry of the triplexes has not Ê Ê changed much (r.m.s. deviations of 0.33 A and 0.24 A for the antiparallel and parallel triplexes, respectively). Atomic resolution enables the calculation of the e.s.d. values on the non-restrained triplet hydrogen bonds (Table 3). Despite the great similarity in hydrogen-bonding distances between the third-strand guanines (denoted GH) and the Watson±Crick bases (denoted as GWC and CWC), the ranges for the structure reported here are always smaller. Two other differences are noteworthy. First, the already weak CHÁ Á ÁO hydrogen bond between C8(GWC) and O6(GH) observed in one of the antiÊ Ê parallel triplets at 2.0 A resolution (3.33 A; Vlieghe et al., Ê 1996b) is even further weakened [3.45 (3) A]. Secondly, the parallel triplets are further stabilized by inter-triplet hydrogen

bonding (Fig. 6). Although observed, but not emphasized, in Ê the 2.0 A structure, the inter-triplet hydrogen-bond distance Ê N4(CWC)Á Á ÁO6(GH) of 2.89 (2) A is shorter than the analoÊ gous intra-triplet distances [3.11 (2) and 3.13 (2) A], in agreement with proposed models for (GÁGC)n triplexes generated by molecular modelling (Van Vlijmen et al., 1990). This inter-triplet hydrogen bonding is possible because of the non-planarity of the triplets, with angles between the base planes ranging from 3.9 to 33.5 . For both types of triplex, the largest inclinations are found between GH and CWC base planes. The third strand divides the major groove into two parts, usually called the Watson±Hoogsteen and Crick± Hoogsteen grooves (Radhakrishnan & Patel, 1993). Comparison of the ®rst and second hydration shells of the different grooves in both triplexes (Fig. 7) shows that most water molecules lie in the Watson±Hoogsteen groove (nine for the parallel and ten for the antiparallel triplex). The Crick± Hoogsteen groove in the antiparallel triplex contains only ®ve water molecules, compared with ten in the parallel triplex. This can be explained by the occurrence of a Mg(H2O)2 6 cluster close to this groove of the parallel triplex and the smaller dimensions and hydrophobic C8±H8 group of the antiparallel triplex. The Watson±Crick or original minor groove of the double helix is more hydrated in the antiparallel triplex (13 water molecules versus six for the parallel triplex) owing to the close proximity of a Mg(H2O)2 cluster. In both 6 triplexes, one water molecule interconnecting the Watson and Hoogsteen strand is found at a comparable position. Â being related to the groove width (Prive et al., 1991). Wide minor grooves contain two water ribbons; narrow minor grooves have a hydration spine, to which we should now add water-mediated inter-strand and intra-strand phosphate± phosphate contacts. In the major groove, a distinctive pattern of water molecules also plays a part in stabilizing the structure. The crystallographic analysis of d(GGCCAATTGG) at the Ê atomic resolution of 1.15 A reported here shows previously unobserved details of the B-DNA conformation and hydration. For example, the conformational ¯exibility of the sugar± phosphate backbone, otherwise only represented by thermal parameters in crystal structures, is also visible in this highresolution structure as a local double conformation in the neighbourhood of phosphate group T17. In the d(AATT) major groove, a base- and phosphate-associated solvent network is identi®ed in great detail. This hydration pattern of the bases follows the pseudo-twofold symmetry of the sequence, but three waters necessary to complete the pattern are missing. Positive density is observed in the ®nal difference electron-density map at their expected positions; however, owing to our strict criteria for solvent selection, these waters were not included in the ®nal model. In trial re®nements, either their temperature factor was unrealistically high Ê (>70 A2) or the peak quality was poor. Using the pseudotwofold symmetry, we have modelled an ideal pattern for the ®rst hydration shell of the AATT major-groove region in B-DNA (Fig. 8) of four interconnected parallel water ribbons, comprising six- and seven-membered rings. The narrow minor groove of the central d(AATT) sequence is occupied by an `extended hydration spine' consisting of a 4. Discussion base-associated hydration spine alternatingly bridging base pairs and extending towards the ¯anking phosphate groups in Solvent molecules play an important role in understanding the the minor-groove walls. The `extended hydration spine' detailed conformation of DNA and its interactions with other provides insight into the well known correlation found molecules in many biological processes. Structural studies on between narrow minor-groove width and the occurrence of the short DNA fragments using X-ray diffraction can be used to BI phosphate conformation (Dickerson, 1990). This `extended identify most solvent molecules in the ®rst hydration region of hydration spine' requires the BI conformation for the ¯anking the helix. However, the details these studies provide of the phosphate groups, with the O1P atoms facing into the minor hydration pattern depend highly on the resolution of the Ê groove. In contrast to the major groove, the hydration pattern diffraction, which is so far limited to 1.3 A for longer B-DNA in the minor groove does not re¯ect the pseudo-twofold fragments. symmetry of the sequence. The highly organized hydration For A-DNA fragments, structured water is seen in the deep pattern in both grooves of the d(AATT) sequence can play an major groove as a ribbon of pentagons (Kennard et al., 1986), important role in the transmission of information into the and/or as phosphate bridges (Wang et al., 1982).

Several hydrogen bonds between the drug and the O and N atoms at the base of the minor groove, together with close van der Waals contacts, are the stabilizing forces of this DNA±drug complex formation.

engineering techniques in order to enhance the ®nal resolution of a crystal structure can also be applied to DNA±minorgroove complexes, which in general do not diffract further Ê than about 2.2 A. We have indeed recently obtained a resoÊ lution enhancement of 0.5 A for the d(GGCCAATTGG)± DAPI complex (D. Vlieghe and L. Van Meervelt, unpublished work). The idea that the ®rst hydration shell around DNA is impermeable to cations was recently questioned by a lowÊ temperature determination of the 12-mer sequence at 1.4 A resolution (Shui et al., 1998) suggesting that ± based on the calculation of the sodium speci®c bond valence (#Na+) ± the base-associated spine of hydration is partially occupied by Na atoms. As it is not possible to differentiate between sodium and water during the re®nement and as the presence of the Mg2+ ions alone cannot compensate for the total negative charge of the oligonucleotide, some waters indeed may be cations. For the base-associated spine water molecules we calculate similar #Na+ values varying from 0.45 to 0.48 [calculated with the program WASP (Nayal & Di Cera, 1996), using Ê a contact distance of 4 A]. Several water molecules not situated in the minor groove have even higher #Na+ values (around 0.50). For all water molecules, #Na+ also has a Gaussian distribution with average 0.26 and standard deviation 0.13. The #Na+ distribution and maximum value for 332 242 water molecules in the PDB (Nayal & Di Cera, 1996) are different from those observed for both oligonucleotides: #Na+ averages at 0.18 with a standard deviation of 0.13, and 64 water molecules have #Na+ ! 1.0 and a distorted octahedral coordination geometry. In this structure, however, the coordination of the base-associated spine water molecules is tetrahedral (see Fig. 4), from which we can conclude that the

Schematic representation of the ideal model for the ®rst hydration shell in the major groove of a B-DNA AATT region (colour scheme as in Fig. 3, waters in light colours were not observed in the crystal structure). The model was generated by using the observed pseudo-twofold symmetry of the solvent network, using only the red- and blue-coloured waters in Fig. 3. Four water ribbons following the sugar backbone direction are shown in thicker red and blue lines, connected in a network of six- and seven-membered rings.

spine consists of fully occupied water molecules. This is strengthened by the fact that ± owing to the tetrahedral arrangement ± positioning of donor±acceptor atoms is possible in the minor-groove hydrogen-bonding pattern. Nucleic acid triplexes are implicated in genetic recombination in vivo and have possible applications in genome analysis and antigene therapy. As previously shown (Vlieghe et al., 1996b), the unpaired 5H -guanine bases in the crystal structure of d(GGCCAATTGG) interact with available hydrogen-bonding sites in the major groove of adjacent duplexes. As a consequence, valuable high-resolution information on the hydration, hydrogen-bonding scheme, groove dimensions and planarity of parallel and antiparallel (GÁGC)2 triple helices is obtained1.
