ABSTRACT: Snake venom contains a number of the hemostatically active C-type lectin-like proteins, which affect the interaction between von Willebrand factor (vWF) and the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib or platelet receptor to inhibit/induce platelet activation. Flavocetin-A (FL-A) is a high-molecular mass C-type lectinlike protein (149 kDa) isolated from the habu snake venom. FL-A binds with high affinity to the platelet GP IbR-subunit and functions as a strong inhibitor of vWF-dependent platelet aggregation. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of FL-A and refined to 2.5 Å resolution. This is a first elucidation of a three-dimensional structure of the platelet GP Ib-binding protein. The overall structure reveals that the molecule is a novel cyclic tetramer (R )4 made up of four R -heterodimers related by a crystallographic 4-fold symmetry. The tetramerization is mediated by an interchain disulfide bridge between cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the R-subunit and at the N-terminus of the -subunit in the neighboring R -heterodimer. The high affinity of FL-A for the platelet GP Ib R-subunit could be explained by a cooperative-binding action through the multiple binding sites of the tetramer.

Glycoprotein (GP)1 Ib is an important platelet adhesion receptor and plays an essential role in primary hemostasis (reviewed in 1, 2). Adhesion of platelets to sites of vascular injury is initiated by the interaction of von Willebrand factor (vWF) exposed on the subendothelium with the platelet GP Ib (3, 4). The same interaction also precipitates pathological platelet aggregation induced by high shear stresses, which occurs at sites of arterial stenosis (5-7). A number of the hemostatically active proteins that affect the interaction between vWF and the platelet GP Ib have been isolated from the venom of several snake species and characterized (reviewed in 8). The venom proteins, which modulate the vWF-GP Ib interaction, have several implications for the elucidation of biological mechanism underlying hemostasis. Botrocetin is a platelet agglutination inducer from the Bothrops jararaca venom (9-12). It is a disulfide-linked heterodimer protein composed of homologous R- and

-subunits (13). This protein binds to vWF to form an active complex, resulting in platelet agglutination (14). Sugimoto et al. provided the first evidence for the location of botrocetin-binding sites in the A1 domain of vWF (15). Bitiscetin is another platelet agglutination inducer from the Bitis arietans venom (16). Although bitiscetin is also a disulfide-linked heterodimer composed of homologous R- and -subunits (17), it binds to the A3 but not to the A1 domain (18). On the other hand, many GP Ib-binding (but not vWF-binding) proteins have been purified from the venom of several snake species (19-26) and sequenced (25-30). Most of them are known to inhibit vWF-dependent platelet aggregation, whereas they are heterodimers similar to botrocetin (reviewed in 31), and low-molecular mass proteins (30 kDa) belonging to the C-type lectin superfamily (32). Recently, a high-molecular mass GP Ib-binding protein was isolated from the habu snake Trimeresurus flaVoViridis venom (33). This protein, called flavocetin-A (FL-A), has a molecular mass of 149 kDa under nonreducing condition. On reduction, FL-A showed two subunits R (17 kDa) and (14 kDa). The amino acid sequences of both subunits of FL-A have been recently determined.2 Sequence comparison revealed that each subunit showed high sequence identity to the corresponding subunit of the low-molecular mass GP Ibbinding proteins. Among those proteins, FL-A binds with the highest affinity (Kd ) 0.35 ( 0.13 nM) to the platelet GP Ib and strongly inhibits vWF-dependent aggregation of fixed human platelets and also inhibits shear-induced platelet aggregation at high shear stress (33).

Fukuda et al. facility, the Photon Factory in High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Japan. X-ray data were collected with the Weissenberg imaging-plate detector system (35). The crystal-to-detector distance was 573 mm. The intensity data up to 85-2.5 Å resolution were processed with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (36). Molecular Replacement. The structure of FL-A was solved by a molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe (37) in the CCP4 suite (38). The search probe was a homology-based heterodimer model constructed with the program HOMOLOGY in the package INSIGHT II (Molecular Simulation Inc.) using the sequence of FL-A and the atomic coordinates (PDB code 1IXX) of a homologous protein, coagulation factors IX/X-binding protein (IX/X-bp) from the venom of T. flaVoViridis (39). The N-terminal residues 1-2 and the C-terminal residues 132-135 of the R-subunit and the corresponding residues 1-3 and 123-125 of the -subunit were then removed. The search model was minimized by the Powell minimization method. A cross-rotation-function search was calculated against all data in the resolution range between 20 and 3.5 Å with a sphere radius of 30 Å and an angular step size of 2.5°. The highest peak from the rotation-function search had a height of 10.8, while the next highest peak was at 8.5. This rotation-function solution was identified at the Eulerian angles of R ) 84.5°, ) 47.0°, and  ) 85.8°. This orientation revealed a number of peaks up to 4.8 in the translation-function searches, but one of the peaks with a correlation coefficient of 20.9% and an R-factor of 54.7% led to the correlation coefficient of 31.7% after the fast-rigidbody refinement (AMoRe), which is much higher than did other peaks. This translation-function solution was identified at fractional coordinates of x ) 0.9850, y ) 0.3650, and z ) 0.0000. Graphical inspection of this solution using the program QUANTA version 97 (Molecular Simulation Inc.) revealed that the molecule of FL-A is a tetramer made up of four R -heterodimers related by a crystallographic 4-fold symmetry parallel to the c-axis, and favorable intermolecular interactions. Structure Refinement. All crystallographic refinements were performed using the program X-PLOR (40) and the parameter set of Engh and Huber (41). The Rfree (42) was calculated with randomly selected 5% reflections not used in the refinement from the beginning process. The initial model obtained from the molecular replacement procedure was first subjected to a rigid-body refinement, and then a simulated annealing to 3000-300K at 3.0 Å resolution. This resulted in an initial R factor of 29.4% and Rfree of 46.8%. A 2Fo-Fc map showed that the -subunit was correctly modeled, but the R-subunit was required to rotate approximately 10° relative to the -subunit around the linker region to fit in the electron density. This might be the reason the molecular replacement calculation did not show a clear solution in the translation-function searches. The model was manually adjusted using the program QUANTA on a Silicon Graphics workstation Indigo2 R10000. After the rigid-body refinement, a simulated annealing of this adjusted model was continued, and the R-factor and Rfree dropped to 23.0% and 38.7%, respectively. At this stage, the quality of the 2Fo-Fc map was sufficient to find the omitted residues in the N- and C-terminal regions. The entire model was rebuilt and subjected to further refinement using simulated anneal-

functional specificity and the molecular recognition of the C-type lectin-like heterodimers, structural studies of FL-A have been initiated. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of a highmolecular mass C-type lectin-like protein determined by X-ray crystallography method. The structure is unique in showing a cyclic tetramer (R )4 made up of four identical R -heterodimers (hereafter, the heterodimer unit of FL-A is referred to as R -heterodimer), which are arranged in a manner of "head-to-tail" interaction, based on a crystallographic 4-fold symmetry. The tetramerization is mediated by an interchain disulfide bridge, newly identified between the R -heterodimers. To the best of our knowledge, the structure is the first to be solved among the GP Ib-binding proteins, and it has a unique disulfide-linked oligomer. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Crystallization and Data Collection. FL-A was purified from the venom of T. flaVoViridis as described previously (33) with modification. The crude venom was dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1 M NaCl and applied to a gel filtration column of Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia). Subsequently, the eluent was chromatographed using Q- and S-Sepharose Fast Flow ionexchange columns (both from Pharmacia). Prismatic crystals of FL-A were grown at 20 °C from a reservoir solution containing 9% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, and 10 mM CaCl2 as described previously (34). The crystals belong to the tetragonal space group I 4 with cell dimensions of a ) b ) 120.5 Å and c ) 62.8 Å. There is one R -heterodimer of FL-A in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 67% (Vm ) 3.7 Å3/Da).

ing, individual B-factor, and positional refinement protocols in the X-PLOR package in the resolution range between 6.0 and 2.5 Å. The R-factor and Rfree improved to 21.8% and 27.8%, respectively; 93 water molecules were added in the model using the X-SOLVATE subroutine of QUANTA. Criteria for the inclusion of water molecules in the structure were the appearance of peaks at 1 in (2Fo-Fc) maps and 3 in (Fo-Fc) maps, and at least one hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein. The final refined model had the R-factor of 21.0% (23.1%) and Rfree of 26.9% (28.6%) against data with 2 cutoff (without  cutoff) in the resolution range between 6.0 and 2.5 Å. The root-mean-square (rms) deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles were 0.007 Å and 1.6°, respectively. The average B-factors for protein and waters were 35.2 and 54.7 Å2, respectively. Table 1 shows a summary of the data collection and refinement statistics. The stereochemistry of the final model was examined by

the program PROCHECK (43). The most favored region in the Ramachandran plot (44) contains 81% of the number of nonglycine and nonproline residues. There are only two residues (LysR37 and Asp 12) in the disallowed region in the Ramachandran plot. The solvent accessible surface area was calculated using the PROTEIN PACKAGE option in the program QUANTA using a 1.4 Å radius of the probe (water molecule). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION OVerall Structure. Crystals of FL-A show the tetragonal space group I 4 with one R -heterodimer per asymmetric unit (34). The backbone chain fold of the R -heterodimer is almost identical to those of the homologous proteins, IX/ X-bp and coagulation factor IX-binding protein (IX-bp), from the venom of T. flaVoViridis as expected from high sequence identity (Figure 1). The R- and -subunits are dimerized in

a manner similar to 3D domain swapping (45) as already described in IX/X-bp and IX-bp (39, 46), and an interchain disulfide bridge connects the two subunits. The overall structure of FL-A is made up of four R -heterodimers related by a crystallographic 4-fold symmetry parallel to the c-axis, showing a cyclic tetramer (R )4. The tetramerization is mediated by another interchain disulfide bridge newly identified between cysteine residues at the C-terminus of the R-subunit and at the N-terminus of the -subunit of the neighboring R -heterodimer. FL-A is thus a high-molecular mass protein (149 kDa) with a unique cyclic oligomer structure through the disulfide covalent interaction (Figure 2). The R -heterodimers are arranged in a manner of "headto-tail" interaction between cysteine residues located at either end of the long axis of the almost linearly elongated dimer unit, forming a square flat ring with dimensions approximately 126 × 126 × 37 Å3 with the disulfide bridge at each corner. The accessible surface area of the molecule was 47 907 Å2. The unusual cyclic square molecule delimits a central pore with approximately 66 × 66 × 37 Å3, providing an extensive solvent channel that is consistent with the relatively large solvent content of 67% in the crystal.

Comparison with Other C-Type Lectin-like Heterodimers. FL-A is the first published structure comprising multiple copies of C-type lectin-like heterodimers. Known structures of IX/X-bp and IX-bp derived from the venom of T. flaVoViridis are made up of only one C-type lectin-like heterodimer. A structural comparison between FL-A and IX/ X-bp (hereafter, only IX/X-bp is used for comparison with FL-A because the structure of IX-bp is very similar to that of IX/X-bp) showed that the rms difference for the equivalent 99(97) CR atom pairs except for the central loops between the R ( )-subunit of FL-A and the A (B)-subunit of IX/Xbp is 0.97 Å (0.81 Å). While, the rms difference for the equivalent 19(18) CR atom pairs of the corresponding central loops between the R ( )-subunit of FL-A and the A (B)subunit of IX/X-bp is 0.73 Å (0.86 Å). In contrast with such structural similarity, the relative disposition of the R- and -subunits of FL-A is different from that of the A- and B-subunits of IX/X-bp; i.e., when the - and B-subunits are superimposed, the R-subunit deviates significantly from the position of the A-subunit (Figure 3). Approximately, a 10° rotation of the R-subunit relative to the -subunit is required for the superposition. This angle is larger than the corre-

sponding value (6° rotation) in the cases of IX/X-bp and IX-bp, and forms a more opened concave surface. This is generated from a constraint by the interchain disulfide bridge between the R -heterodimers for tetramerization in FL-A. Another structural difference between FL-A and IX/X-bp is whether or not calcium-binding sites are present. IX/Xbp has two common calcium-binding sites; one is in the A-subunit and the other in the homologous site of the B-subunit. In contrast, these potential sites in FL-A are not present despite being topologically equivalent to those in IX/ X-bp. This is due to differences in amino acid residues. The residues Ser41, Glu43, and Glu47 in the calcium-binding site of the A-subunit in IX/X-bp are conserved, but the residue Glu128 is replaced by lysine at the corresponding site in the R-subunit of FL-A. Figure 4 shows the differences

in these sites between the corresponding subunits in both FL-A and IX/X-bp. The residue LysR130 is inserted into the site corresponding to the position of the calcium ion in the A-subunit of IX/X-bp. The atom NZ of LysR130 replaces the calcium ion (Figure 4A) and forms the hydrogen bonds with the atom OE2 of GluR45 (2.72 Å) and the atom OE1 of GluR49 (2.86 Å). Similarly, the residues Ser41 and Glu47 in the calcium-binding site of the B-subunit in IX/X-bp are conserved, but the residues Gln43 and Glu120 are replaced by histidine and lysine, respectively, in the corresponding site in the -subunit of FL-A. The atom NZ of Lys 122 replaces the calcium ion (Figure 4B) and forms the hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of Ser 43 (3.21 Å), the atom OE2 of Glu 49 (3.01 Å), the oxygen of Wat27 (hereafter, a water molecule is referred to as a Wat)

(3.26 Å), and the atom OG of Ser 43 (3.02 Å). These hydrogen bonds and the neutralization by positively charged lysine residues may stabilize the structure of FL-A without calcium-binding. Intersubunit Interfaces. There are two types of an intersubunit interface in the molecule of FL-A within and between the R -heterodimers. One is an interface within the R heterodimer generated from a domain swapping. This interface corresponds to the C-interface defined in 3D domain swapping (45). This C-interface in FL-A is represented by a hydrophobic interaction between the central loop of one subunit and a body side in the globular unit of the adjacent subunit as described in IX/X-bp (39) and IX-bp (46). The residues involved in the C-interface in FL-A are as follows: the residues Trp81 (Trp85), Leu87 (Val91), Tyr89 (Tyr93), and Trp92 (Leu96) in the swapped loop of the (R)-subunit and the residues Ile44 (Phe44), Leu72 (Leu70), and Trp116

(Trp108) on the body side of the R( )-subunit. Although the residue corresponding to Trp77 in the swapped loop of the B-subunit in IX/X-bp (38) is replaced by Lys79 (Ser83) in the swapped loop of the (R)-subunit in FL-A, this is similar to the case of the residue Ser81 in the swapped loop of the A-subunit in IX/X-bp. The two subunits are held together by a common interchain disulfide bridge between the residues CysR81 and Cys 77. Recently, sequenced C-type lectin-like heterodimer protein rhodocetin, a platelet aggregation inhibitor isolated from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Calloselasma rhodostoma, has no such interchain disulfide bridge (47). The R- and -subunits in this protein are held together only by noncovalent interactions, probably the C-interface, because it is expected to be a domain-swapped heterodimer. The C-interface in the C-type lectin-like heterodimer from snake venom is thus crucial to connect the subunits.

Hydrogen bond distances (Å) are indicated.

Another subunit interface is formed between the R heterodimers where the R- and -subunits are connected by another disulfide bridge between the residues CysR135 and Cys 3, lying in the C-terminal -strand of the R-subunit and the N-terminal loop of the -subunit, respectively. The electron-density map around the disulfide bridge is shown in Figure 5. The residue CysR135 is at the end of the

additional C-terminal peptide, which is largely exposed from the body compared with IX/X-bp (Figure 3B), allowing the disulfide bridge with the residue Cys 3 that replaces aspartic acid in IX/X-bp. Five direct hydrogen bonds and one watermediated hydrogen bond exist in this interface (Figure 6, Table 2). Involved in the hydrogen bonds are mainly the backbone chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms and three side chains of the residues Asp1-OD1 and Asp12-OD1 in the R-subunit, and His36-ND1 in the -subunit of the neighboring R -heterodimer. The buried area is 400 Å2. This corresponds to 3.1% of the total accessible surface area (12 777 Å2) of one R -heterodimer, well below the value for typical oligomeric proteins (48). This contact area is so small that the interchain disulfide bridge may play a central role to form and stabilize the tetrameric heterodimer structure of FL-A. Platelet GP Ib-Binding. FL-A binds with high affinity to the platelet GP Ib R-subunit and functions as a strong inhibitor of vWF-dependent aggregation of fixed human platelets (33). It has been reported that FL-A has a dissociation constant of 0.35 ( 0.13 nM to platelets, according to the results of a direct-binding assay using iodine-labeled FL-A and fixed human platelets (33), showing approximately 10- to 100-fold less than the value of echicetin from the Echis carinatus venom (21). Convulxin (CVX), another highmolecular mass C-type lectin-like protein (72 kDa) from the Crotalus durissus terrificus venom (49), binds with high affinity (Kd ) 30 pM) to the collagen receptor GP VI and functions as a very potent inducer of platelet aggregation (50-52). These facts reflect that the oligomer proteins comprise multiple copies of the R -heterodimer and induce the binding to the platelet GP receptors more efficiently than proteins made up of only one R -heterodimer. CVX has also additional cysteine residues, CysR135 and Cys 3, which might form an interchain disulfide bridge for oligomerization as observed in FL-A. Leduc and Bon postulated that CVX is a trimer (R )3 of the R -heterodimers (53), although there is no structural evidence to support this. The residues in FL-A involved in the intersubunit interface, which are important for the tetramerization as described above, are well-conserved in CVX. This suggests that the R -heterodimers of CVX are arranged in a manner similar to FL-A to form a cyclic oligomer. Such oligomerization of the R -heterodimers might

generate a cooperative-binding action through the multiple binding sites to platelet GP receptor to gain a much higher affinity. The high-sequence identities with other GP Ib-binding proteins, i.e., echicetin from the E. carinatus venom (27, 30) and jararaca GP Ib-binding protein from the B. jararaca venom (28) (Figure 7, only the -subunits are compared because of hydrophilic patches described below), imply that their three-dimensional structures are very similar to that of the R -heterodimer of FL-A. Although the conserved peptides mapped on the sequence are mainly involved in the formation of hydrophobic cores inside the R -heterodimer, two peptide fragments in the -subunit show hydrophilic patches exposed to solvent (Figures 7 and 8), which are considered as possible candidates for the platelet GP Ibbinding sites. One is in the second R-helix in the -subunit where the residues Ser 46, Ser 47, Glu 48, and Asp 51 (Asn 44 and Lys 46 in echicetin) are involved (patch I). This patch is in a slightly deeper pocket near the central concave surface of the R -heterodimer. Another hydrophilic patch (patch II) is formed by the residues Lys 102, Thr 104,

Asp 105, Asn 106, and Gln 107, which lie in a loop closed by an intrachain disulfide bond between the residues Cys 98 and Cys 113. So the backbone chain position is relatively constrained and contributes to the formation of a part of the central concave surface of the R -heterodimer. The atom ND2 of the residue Asn 106 in the patch II forms a salt bridge (2.90 Å) with the atom OD1 of the residue Asp 51 in the patch I, showing these patches are spatially close together (Figure 8). The candidates for the platelet GP Ib R-binding sites are thus in the -subunit, but not in the R-subunit. This is consistent with the result of an inhibition study based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using biotin-labeled jararaca GP Ib-binding protein from the B. jararaca venom and competing ligands (28). Crystallographic studies of FL-A in complex with the platelet GP Ib R-subunit are required to know the binding sites and the interactions between the two molecules. The crystal structure of FL-A at 2.5 Å resolution revealed that FL-A is a novel cyclic tetramer (R )4 made up of four identical C-type lectin-like R -heterodimers covalently held together by interchain disulfide bridges. This study also

Flavocetin-A is a Novel Cyclic Tetramer revealed for the first time a three-dimensional structure of the platelet GP Ib-binding protein. The high affinity of FL-A for the platelet GP Ib R-subunit could be explained by a cooperative-binding action through the multiple binding sites of the tetramer. The candidate of the binding sites is considered to be located along two hydrophilic patches on the -subunit. The structure of FL-A presented here should constitute an essential background for the design and development of drugs and/or model compounds as platelet antagonists.
