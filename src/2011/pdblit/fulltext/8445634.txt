The stoichiomclric complex formed bctwccn porcine /?-trypsin and the MormAicu cfturunriu, Linn. Cucurhifucc~etrypsin inhibitor-A (MCTI-A) was crystallized and its X-ray crystal structure determined using molecular rcplacemcnt melhod. The primary scrluencc and topology of the inhibitor wus delcrmined by rceognizing the clcxxron density and rcfincd to a final R value of 0.167 (7.0-l .6 A) with RMS dcvialion of bond lengths from standard values 0.012 A. The scqucnce was compared with those obtained by other groups and was found to be similar to the squash protcinase inhibitor. Its spatial structure and the conformation of its primary binding scgmcnt from Cys-31 (P3) to Glu-71 (P3') which contains the rcactivc scissilc bond Arg-51 C-Ile-61 N were also very similar with other squash family protcinase inhibitors.

1. INTRODUCTION
There are many plant proteinase inhibitors which play important roles in the piant's life [l-4]. X-Ray crystallography provides a unique methcd to obtain a detailed description of the spatial structure and interactions between proteinase and inhibitor. Three trypsin inhibitors (MCTI-A, -6, 42) were purified from Bitter Gourd seeds (~Vornork~z ckaruntia, Linn. Cucurbirucece). Among them MCTI-A is very resistant to heat or acid denaturation and exhibits strong inhibition towards trypsin (Ki= I .7 x lo-`" M). The amino acid compostition, primary sequence

and the disulfide topology were unknown at the start of this study. We have determined its primary and spatial structure by X-ray crystallography. Comparison of our results with those of other groups shows that MCTI-A is a member of squash family inhibitors [4-g]. We report the structure determination of the complex of this inhibitor with porcinep-trypsin [lO,ll]. The final coordinates will be deposited at the Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
MCTI-A inhibitor was isolated and purified from the seeds of Bitter Gourd (Guangzhou Seeds Co., China) (Qian, R., personal comCorrespondencenddr~ss:Q. Huang, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Peking University, 100871 Beijing, PR China.

MCTI-A and porcine&trypsin wcrc dissolved in 0.01 M HAc-NaAc bulkr (pH 4.3) at a ratio of 1:5.4 (w/w). lotal protein concentration was 2% (w/v). Crystals were obtained using `hanging drop' vapour diffusion technique. Precipitant solution was 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 35% saturalion NaCI. pi-i G.O-7.0.The reservoir solution was the same as the precipitant enc. but NaCl was 85% saturation. Trigonal crystals of space group P3221were obtained al 24°C within about one week; the cell constants arc u=O=62.65 A. c=I24.31 A. a=p=90°. y=120". The crystal contains one complex molecule per asymmetric unit and diffracts to almost I .4 A. X-Ray inlcnsity data were collecled with sevcrdl direrent Jeleclors. They were further processed and merged by means of the PROTEIN program package [I21 (see Table I). The rotalion of the trypsin component was dctcrmined by fast rotation function program FROT [13] using the relined bovine /3trypsin model [14],The positioning ofthc trypsin molecule in the unit cell [I51 was achicved by a tr;lnslation function search method with programs written by E.E. Lattmann [I61 (modified by J. Deiscnhofcr and R. Hub@. Different residues of porcine ,0-trypsin from bovine p-trypsin [IO] and the inhibitor model were built intoelcctron density using program TOM/FRODO [ l7.l8]. The complex model was ret'incdwith the energy restraint crystallographic refincmcnt procedures in program XPLOR Tl9.201. After the crvstallofiraphic R value had dromxd to 0.26, gro;p and'restraint B vaiucs were ietined on 7.0-l .6 A rcsdlution data. Solvent molecules were inserted at stcreochcmically rcasonablc poshions where the difference electron density exceeded 3~. Finally. !he individual atomic B values were also refined. The final R value (defined as R = 4 lF,l-lF,l I/Z/r':ol) 31.697 unique reflections within for 7.0-1.6 A resolution is 0.167. The final refinement characteristics are given in Table II.

is a member of squash proteinase inhibitor family [4-91 (see Fig. I). There are 5 amino residues whose assignments are uncertain (RI, S2, Tl 1, I419 and A24) because ofweak and irregular side chain electron density. We place these residues according to the lengths of the side chain electron density at 1~ contour level. It is impossible to distinguish between Asp and Asn, Glu and Gin, Val and Thr, because they have the same side chain shape. We define these amino residues according to the homologies with other known squash inhibitors
P-91.

After finishing our work we noticed the results obtained by Saburo Hara et al. on three proteinase inhibitors from Bitter Gourd [5]. Compared with their results we Found that our MCTl-A is very similar to their MCTI-II. Three out of Four different residues of our results are of shorter side chains than theirs and all differences occur where thL;re is some doubt in assignment of the side chain electron density. These differences may be caused by different sources of proteins, or by errors in analysis. Chemical analysis of our sample is in progress. Porcine ,&trypsin differs From bovine /I-trypsin in 39 residues. These residues can be fitted to electron density with the exception of the Arg-I 25, which is disordered. Residue 27 of porcine trypsin appears to be Ile and not Val [lo]. In the Fourier map the inhibitor's primary binding

segment 3I(P3')-8I(P3) is clear and the atoms have low B values. Whole inhibitor shows continuous electron density although it is weak at Arg-II position, the Nterminus. There are three strong fixed solvent molecules of low B values, namely 24W, BSW, 72W, and these can be considered as integral constituents of the inhibitor structure. The trypsin chain can be completely traced from its C-terminus to its N-terminus, but with several side chain atoms being undefined (all involved in crystal contacts). The calcium ion is at almost the same position as Found by others [22]. Our inhibitor model is similar in structure to the inhibitor from pumpkin seeds Cmwbiru rmsinzu (CMTI1) determined by W. Bode et al. [23]. Fig. 2 shows the Ccc drawing of the complex, with the projection direction close to that shown in 1231.The inhibitor roughly exhibits the shape of a flat-iron, with the base plate made up of the polypeptide chain from Met-81 on. and the grip Formed by the protruding reactive site loop containing the scissile peptide bond Arg-51 C-lie-61 N.

peptide bond Arg-51 C-He-61 N is normal, and no distortion about the planarity is observed. The distance between Ser-195 OG and Arg-51 is 2.57 A [22,23]. 4. DlSCUSSION This structure analysis shows that it is possible to sequence an unknown protein by X-ray crystallog-

The inhibitor has no regular secondary structure, except a type-11 tight turn at 171-201 and a type I' tight turn at 231-261. One residue (Ala-181) at the type-11 turn shows the conformation outside the allowed region of 50- ry [24], with tp=39.7", 1/1=-12G.9°. Fig. 3 shows the hydrogen bond scheme of the inhibitor. The hydrogen bond between Arg-1 I 0 and Cys-31 N observed in [23] was not observed in our results. Because of the high temperature factors of the side chain atoms of Arg-11, the hydrogen bonds between them and the core of the inhibitor reported by W. Bode are not confirmed by our result. There are 5 pairs of intermolecular main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and trypsin. As observed in other trypsin- inhibitor complexes [22,23,25], these hydrogen bonds are between Cys-31 (P3) and Gly-216, between Arg-51 (Pl) and Ser-214, Gly-193, Ser-195, between Trp-71 and Phe-41. The complete structure of the inhibitor is illustrated in Fig. 4. The side chain of Pl-residue Arg-51 is accommodated in the Sl-pocket of trypsin with almost identical geometry to that reported in [22,23,25]. The distal guanidyl group is engaged in pairs of hydrogen bonds with Ser-190 OG, Asp-189 OD, and OD1, and its NE atom in hydrogen bonds with solvent 58W OW, which is further hydrogen bonded to Gin- 192 OE, and Cys-310. The conformation of the contacting area of the inhibitor and trypsin is the same as that observed by others [22,23,25], especially the P3'-P3 segment of the inhibitor and the S3'-53 of the trypsin. Tile WivIS deviation of equivalent atoms of MCTI-A and Mung bean inhibitor lysine fragment [25] from 31 to 71 is 0.31 A, but from residue 81 onwards the 2 folds are different. The scissile

mphy. The high resolution of our reflection data and the tight binding between the inhibitor and trypsin were important in the success of this project. The result shows that is is easy to determine a porcine&trypsin's structure based on bovine ,&trypsin using molecular replacement method, though there are 39 different residues between them. Comparison of our MCTI-A sequence and MCTI-II obtained by Saburo Hara et al. [5] shows that these two inhibitors may be the same, since they have almost the same sequence. In spite of the small size of this inhibitor, the interaction pattern is almost the same as that observed in other related complexes. There is considerable similarity in structure to Cucurbita Maxima inhibitor, CMTI-I, another member of the squash trypsin inhibitor family, though it is a residue shorter than CMTI-I. Like other squash inhibitors, MCTI-A contains a high amount of Cys amino residues (>20%). As observed in other high Cys content inhibitors such as Mung bean inhibitor [3,25], MCTI-A lacks any regular secondary structure. MCTI-A has the disulfide connectivities where the first three cysteine residues are covalently linked with the last three in consecutive order. These make an important contribution to stability of this inhibitor. The inhibition site Arg-51 between 2 pairs of disulfide bridges: Cys-SICys-201 and Cys-IOI-Cys-221, at the second site beside the first disulfide pair. Those residues from Cys-31 to Cys-101, Cys-201-Cys-221 and Tao pairs of disulfide bridges can be thought of as a 12-14 amino acid residue ring, like those observed in Birman-Birk type inhibitors [3,25]. Since the relative disorder of the N-terminus, Arg-11, the hypothesis suggested by W. Bode that the salt bridge of the Arg-11 side chain with the carboxyterminus existing in CMTI-I promotes stability, was not supported by our results [23]. MCTI-A is suitable for synthetic studies because of its small size and strong trypsin inhibition. In our laboratory, the complex of trypsin and Mung bean inhibitor, a kind of Birman-Birk type inhibitor and its Lys active fragment have been studied [25]. Several small peptides consisting of a fragment of Mung bean inhibitor have been synthesized in our group. They show relatively weak inhibition of trypsin compared with the natural

inhibitor. The crystals of trypsin and these synthesized peptides have been obtained. Combined with MCTI-A structure, the results should extend our understanding of trypsin-inhibitor complexes.
