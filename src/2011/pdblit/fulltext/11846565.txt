Spinach chloroplast NAD(P)-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-GAPDH; EC, 1.2.1.13) was purified as the 600-kDa oligomer of low specific activity. Incubation of the enzyme with either a reductant or a 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3bisPGA) generating system, but most effectively with both, resulted in an increase of the apparent NADPH-dependent activity. Only the 1,3bisPGA treatment caused dissociation and yielded the 150-kDa heterotetramer (A2B2). The higher activity of the tetramer is largely due to a decreased KM value for the substrate 1,3bisPGA. Reductive treatment alone does not dissociate the enzyme. Reduction was equally effective with glutathione as with dithiothreitol or with reduced thioredoxin f. The concentration of 1,3bisPGA required to obtain 50% activity (Ka) was 19.5 { 4.1 mM for the untreated enzyme and 2.0 { 1.4 mM for the thiol-pretreated enzyme. Thus, in vitro 1,3bisPGA, alone or--at much lower concentrations--together with a reductant can activate (and dissociate) NAD(P)-GAPDH. The enzyme exhibits similar Ka values in its reduced and its oxidized form for ATP (1­2 mM), NADP (50­200 mM), and NADPH (0.3­ 0.5 mM) as positive effectors, but these effectors do not lead to any activation when present together with 0.14 mM NAD. Only 1,3bisPGA retained its characteristic effect in the presence of NAD. The dissociated enzyme reaggregates upon removal of the positive effectors. From these results it is concluded (i) that the role of the reduction of the NAD(P)-GAPDH in vivo is to increase its sensitivity toward the activator 1,3bisPGA and (ii) that the actual activation (and aggregation) state of the enzyme in chloroplasts in the light is regulated by the concentration of 1,3bisPGA as activator

NAD(P)-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-GAPDH; EC 1.2.1.13) is an oxidoreductase catalyzing the reversible interconversion between 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3bisPGA)3 and GAP using both NADP(H) and NAD(H) as coenzymes (1). It is exclusively localized in the plastids where it catalyzes the reductive step in the Calvin cycle during CO2 fixation. NAD(P)-GAPDH was the first enzyme whose extractable activity was shown to rapidly respond to illumination (2). After initially postulating de novo synthesis, it soon became clear that the change of activity observed was due to some kind of posttranslational modification, possibly redox-modulation (3). This finding was supported by various studies using DTT and reduced thioredoxin as enzyme activators (4). However, at the same time, other experiments have been reported where effector-mediated activation of the enzyme had been achieved in the absence of a reducing agent (3, 5­9). Effectors such as ATP, NADP, NADPH, the substrate 1,3bisPGA, and even organic cosolvents (10) have been reported to increase the specific activity of the NAD(P)-GAPDH, while other metabolites (e.g., NAD, NADH, or GAP) decrease the activation state back to the ground level (5). In contrast to the cytosolic NADH-dependent isoenzyme, which is homotetrameric, the chloroplast isoenAbbreviations used: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; 1,3bisPGA, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; DTT, dithiothreitol; GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSG, oxidized glutathione; FPLC, fastperformance liquid chromatography; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; 3PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; PGK, 3PGA kinase. 201

BAALMANN ET AL. using a NAP-5 column (Pharmacia, Freiburg) equilibrated with the required buffer. Recombinant thioredoxin f was a generous gift of P. Schurmann, Neuchatel. ^ ¨ Preincubation of the enzyme. To generate 1,3bisPGA a stock mixture was prepared consisting of 100 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA, 8 mM MgSO4 , 9 mM 3PGA, 4 mM ATP, and PGK (3.6 units/ ml). All preincubations were at room temperature for 20 min, if not indicated otherwise. The enzyme (about 60 mg per milliliter) was incubated with the required amount of this mixture, which was degassed and flushed with nitrogen. The 1,3bisPGA concentration in the incubation medium was calculated according to the following equation (16): [1,3bisPGA] Å 3.1 1 1004 1 [ATP] 1 [3PGA]. Because ATP alone can cause activation of the enzyme, in some experiments the final ATP concentration was lowered to 0.2 mM, and the 3PGA concentration was increased to obtain the same 1,3bisPGA content. No activating effect was observed when ATP and MgCl2 , PGK, or 3PGA was present alone or when MgCl2 , ATP, and 3PGA were used together in the absence of the kinase. The 1,3bisPGA concentration during preincubation can be assumed to remain constant, since (i) no coenzyme is present to allow its catalytic conversion and (ii) any loss by hydrolysis would be replaced via the PGK equilibrium reaction. Incubation of the enzyme with reducing agents was performed routinely in the presence of 20 mM DTT at pH 7.8 or as indicated. Enzyme assay. The activity of the NAD(P)-GAPDH was determined in aliquot portions of the preincubation mixture. The assay was performed in the direction of NADPH consumption as described (17), but DTT was omitted from the assay. In all cases, buffers for preincubation and assay were degassed and flushed with nitrogen prior to usage. The substrate 1,3bisPGA (usually 55 mM) was formed in the assay mixture during a 10-min incubation period before the enzyme was added. The initial velocity of the time course of the reaction was taken to calculate the enzyme activity. Determination of molecular mass. The enzyme was desalted and preincubated under the various conditions prior to the experiment. If not indicated otherwise, preincubation was for 20 min in a buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.8, 0.5 mM EDTA, and the indicated additions. For each experiment, 60 mg of purified NAD(P)GAPDH in a final volume of 1 ml was used. Gel filtration was performed using an FPLC system (Pharmacia) and a calibrated column (Superdex-200, Pharmacia) with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min at 8 C. Elution was achieved using a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, and the indicated additions. The fractions were collected in vessels prefilled with argon and each vessel was closed immediately afterward. The initial velocities of activity in these fractions were determined in the standard assay. Protein determination. The dye-binding assay with Serva Blue G 250 was used to determine the protein content, with BSA as a standard (18).

zyme consists of two kinds of subunits of differing size, A (37 kDa) and B (43 kDa) (11). They exhibit a high sequence similarity with each other and with other prokaryotic GAPDHs, except for the additional C-terminus of B (12, 13). The aggregation state can be a tetramer (A2B2) of 150 kDa or a hexadecamer of 600 kDa [(A2B2)4], with NAD mediating the appearance of the hexadecamer (5). Although there is a vast amount of data describing the above-mentioned effects on the properties and the aggregation state of chloroplast GAPDH in much detail, a clear concept of the mechanism of its activation in the light in vivo was not available until recently. In a previous study (14), we showed that in isolated intact chloroplasts NAD(P)-GAPDH can be activated by illumination or by incubating the plastids with DTT and/ or 3PGA plus ATP in the dark. These latter compounds are imported into the chloroplasts, and ATP and 3PGA are converted into 1,3bisPGA by the plastidic PGK. The extent of activation was shown to parallel the increasing stromal concentrations of 1,3bisPGA. Dissociation of a 600-kDa form into a 150-kDa form can be observed in the light as well as upon incubation with ATP and 3PGA in the dark, but not after treatment with DTT alone in the dark. Furthermore, the concentration of 1,3bisPGA (calculated from the stromal contents of ATP, ADP, and 3PGA) required to dissociate the enzyme is much lower during illumination or after addition of DTT (14). From the results obtained with isolated intact chloroplasts, we have proposed a model that describes the actual light activation of the enzyme as a reductive step that does not involve dissociation and a concomitant activation/dissociation by 1,3bisPGA due to the increased susceptibility of the reduced enzyme to the effector (14). In vitro, activation of NAD(P)-GAPDH can be achieved by other stromal metabolites (5­9). In addition, negative effectors such as GAP, NAD, and NADH are present in the stroma. Using the purified enzyme, it is possible to study the effects of all effectors and their interactions systematically. We therefore analyzed the purified enzyme with respect to its activation by various reductants and by various effectors and concomitantly related the observed changes of the kinetic parameters to the enzyme structure. The results of these experiments were fully in agreement with the model that had been established for the regulation of the enzyme activation state in vivo.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Protein purification. The NAD(P)-GAPDH was purified to apparent homogeneity from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves essentially as described by Pupillo and Faggiani (15). The purified enzyme was stored in 25 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM EDTA, 75 mM KCl, 1.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 70 mM NAD/, and 50% (v/v) glycerol at 020 C. Prior to each experiment the enzyme solution was desalted

RESULTS

1. Activation of Purified Spinach Chloroplast NAD(P)-GAPDH by Thiols and Effectors When the activity of purified NAD(P)-GAPDH is determined in the standard reductive assay, the time course of the catalytic reaction shows a lag phase of 2­ 5 min when no reducing agent is present in the cuvette (data not shown). This effect is due to the activation of the enzyme by 1,3bisPGA present at 55 mM in the cu-

sence of reductant also lead to some significant activation of the enzyme. However, it should be noted that the time course of enzyme activation can be influenced by other factors. The presence of organic or inorganic mono- or divalent ions (e.g., KCl, Mg-acetate) in concentrations of 30 mM or more leads to increased activation rates. On the other hand, the protein concentration during the incubation with effectors affects the activation rate (data not shown). When the NADH-dependent activities were followed using the standard assay with 0.2 mM NADH instead of NADPH, no significant changes of the basic activity of about 40 U/mg protein were apparent as also has been described by Trost et al. (19). However, DTT pretreatment somewhat increased this level in our experiments (data not shown). 2. Catalytic Properties of the Various Activation States of NAD(P)-GAPDH To obtain further information on the kinetic properties of the various enzyme forms, their behavior with respect to substrate saturation was analyzed. The affinity of all NAD(P)-GAPDH forms for the coenzyme NADPH was essentially the same with KM values between 30 and 60 mM. Thus, the 200 mM NADPH present in the standard assay should be saturating in all cases. In contrast, 1,3bisPGA, which was calculated to be 55 mM in the standard assay mixture, was below saturation for the untreated and the DTT-pretreated enzyme (KM ú100 and 90 mM, respectively) and just about saturating for the enzyme pretreated with 1,3bisPGA (KM of about 20 mM) (Table I). From the double-reciprocal plots it became evident that all enzyme forms exhibit similar maximal velocities of between 110 and 140 U/mg protein (Table I). Therefore, changes in the activation state as shown in Fig. 1 are due to changes of the affinity toward 1,3bisPGA that become especially apparent when subsaturating levels of the substrate are used in the assay. However, even when using the standard assay (55 mM) the differences between the enzyme forms are evident. The affinity of the NAD(P)-GAPDH toward NADH turns out to be rather low for all activation states (KM between 0.12 and 0.29 mM) (Table II), so that the effects observed using the standard assay with 0.2 mM NADH reflect activities measured under limiting substrate conditions. Regardless, the maximal velocity (about 50 U/mg protein) can be obtained using this assay with 0.2 mM NADH. The 1,3bisPGA concentration of the standard assay, however, with NADH as coenzyme is more or less saturating for all forms (KM 16­35 mM). 3. Activation Constants (Ka ) for 1,3bisPGA, ATP, NADP, and NADPH As can be seen from Fig. 1, the activity of both the untreated (oxidized) and the thiol-treated forms can

(A) The enzyme was preincubated for 20 min in the presence of 10 mM DTT (l, ), 10 mM DTT plus thioredoxin f ( ), 1 mM GSH ( ), or 20 mM DTT ( ). After this time, 10 mM 1,3bisPGA (generating system) was added (l, , , ). As a control, the components of the 1,3bisPGA generating system without PGK ( ) were added to the incubation mixture.

vette as a substrate (19). Only the initial rate of the reaction reflects the true enzyme activation state in the sample. To differentiate between the effects of the various activators upon the enzyme, preincubation was in two steps. The first treatment was with various thiols and activation was relatively low (Fig. 1A). The subsequent addition of 10 mM 1,3bisPGA (as 1,3bisPGA generating system) to the latter incubation medium resulted in a large increase of the activation state of NAD(P)-GAPDH. The final level of activity of 110 { 30 U/mg protein was obtained within 5 to 15 min of incubation. Pretreatment of the enzyme with reduced thioredoxin f (molar ratio of 1:0.1), but even with GSH (1 mM) instead of DTT resulted in the same effect, suggesting that reductive modification of the enzyme can be achieved with a reductant of relatively weak reducing power. After pretreatment of the desalted enzyme in the absence of reductant or with oxidized glutathione, only higher concentrations of 1,3bisPGA lead to, however, partial activation of the enzyme (Fig. 1B). These results show that four different forms of the NAD(P)-GAPDH can be obtained: the low basal activity of about 10 U/mg protein can be doubled by incubation with reducing agents. Maximum activity is obtained only when both reductant and 1,3bisPGA are added. Finally, high concentrations of 1,3bisPGA in the ab-

be further stimulated by incubation with 1,3bisPGA, however, to differing extents. In the following experiments, the activation by 1,3bisPGA and other metabolite activators was further analyzed. Various 1,3bisPGA concentrations were obtained by varying the 3PGA concentration in the preincubation mixture, while the concentration of ATP was kept constant at 0.2 mM. The steady-state activities obtained after 20 min were measured in the standard assay, and the initial velocities were plotted against the calculated concentration of 1,3bisPGA of the preincubation mixture. The Ka values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots. For the untreated enzyme the Ka value for 1,3bisPGA appears to be rather high (19.5 { 4.1 mM), while the DTT-pretreated enzyme is characterized by the low Ka value of 2.0 { 1.4 mM (Table III). The activation constants for ATP, NADP, and NADPH were determined in a similar way. They turned out to be rather high and, in contrast to those for 1,3bisPGA, to be more or less independent upon the reductive pretreatment of the enzyme (Table III). Since in vivo the negative effector NAD will be present at significant concentrations in addition to the positive effector(s), we followed its effect on the time course of the activation of the NAD(P)-GAPDH. When the enzyme is activated (and dissociated) by 2 mM ATP, NAD at 0.14 mM prevents or reverts this activation (Fig. 2).

In contrast, the activation by 1,3bisPGA is not influenced, whether NAD is present from the beginning or upon later addition (Fig. 2). Thus, it was also of interest to determine all activation constants in the presence of 0.14 mM NAD. The positive effectors NADP, NADPH, and ATP did not cause activation under these conditions. In contrast, the difference between the Ka for 1,3bisPGA of the oxidized and the reduced enzyme remained unchanged, even in the presence of NAD (Table III). 4. Aggregation States of the Various Forms of NAD(P)-GAPDH To determine the apparent molecular masses of the enzyme forms obtained during preincubation with reductant and with effectors, respectively, gel filtrations of the different enzyme forms obtained in the absence and in the presence of reductant and/or metabolite activators have been performed as described under Material and Methods. The enzyme is isolated in the oxidized state and occurs in its high-molecular-mass form as described earlier (15, 20). Therefore, it elutes as a protein of 600 kDa from the Superdex-200 column (Fig. 3A). When the enzyme is preincubated with DTT or with reduced thioredoxin f and chromatography is performed in the presence of the reductant, the enzyme

remains in its high-molecular-mass form (Fig. 3B), exhibiting only a slightly increased apparent activity. This is in contrast to the finding of Trost et al. (19) who found a peak at the position of lower molecular weight in the presence of DTT, however, only with 9% recovery, using the Superose-12 column. At effector concentrations around the Ka , when elution was with the respective preincubation medium, the enzyme partially remained in its 600-kDa form, but the 150-kDa form appeared in addition. Thus, using gel filtration, the difference in the Ka for 1,3bisPGA between the oxidized and the reduced enzyme can be demonstrated. A concentration of 2 mM 1,3bisPGA is equivalent to the Ka value of the reduced enzyme, but is about 1/10 of the Ka of the oxidized enzyme. When purified NAD(P)GAPDH was treated with the 1,3bisPGA generating system at 2 mM 1,3bisPGA, only a very small fraction of the protein and the NAD(P)-GAPDH activity appeared around 150 kDa (data not shown). When DTT (10 mM) was present during preincubation with 2 mM 1,3bisPGA, about two-thirds of the protein appeared at 600 kDa, but about half of the NAD(P)-GAPDH activity was eluted as the 150-kDa form (Fig. 4). The differences between pro-

tein and activity peaks reflect the different apparent activities of the NAD(P)-GAPDH forms. Only under conditions that also lead to maximum activation, i.e., in the presence of either 2 mM NADP with or without reductant (data not shown) or 50 mM 1,3bisPGA with reductant, complete conversion into the 150kDa form was to be observed (Fig. 5A). Reversal of this dissociation was achieved after removal of 1,3bisPGA by desalting the activated enzyme and subsequently incubating the enzyme with 0.14 mM NAD (Fig. 5B). 5. Interconversions of the Various NAD(P)-GAPDH Forms From the results presented in this paper we designed a scheme comprising all forms of the enzyme that be-

come apparent upon the various treatments with effector and/or reductant (Figs. 3­5). The model (Fig. 6) includes the fact that reduction induces some conformational change on the enzyme which increases its sensitivity toward the effector 1,3bisPGA, but does not lead to dissociation of the oligomer. Only the effectors are causing dissociation and concomitantly a decrease

of the KM for the substrate 1,3bisPGA of the reduced enzyme. When present at high concentrations during preincubation, the oxidized enzyme also can be activated and thereby be dissociated by 1,3bisPGA and other metabolites. Therefore, the activation state obtained upon incubation with 1,3bisPGA or NADP alone at nonsaturating concentrations represents simply a mixture of oxidized low-affinity hexadecamer and highaffinity tetramer (Figs. 1 and 4). While in the absence of NAD, ATP, NADP, and NADPH also can act as positive effectors leading to activation and dissociation; in the presence of NAD, only 1,3bisPGA and none of the others acts as an enzyme activator (Table III). In conclusion, the active tetramer can be obtained either by treatment with a high concentration of the effector 1,3bisPGA alone or, under reducing conditions, with much lower concentrations of the effector. After removal of 1,3bisPGA, but even in the presence of ATP or NADP(H), reaggregation and inactivation can be achieved by incubation with NAD (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION

FIG. 5. Aggregation states of purified spinach chloroplast NAD(P)GAPDH. (A) The enzyme was preincubated for 60 min in the presence of 50 mM 1,3bisPGA plus 20 mM DTT and was eluted from the Superdex-200 column in elution buffer with 20 mM DTT plus 50 mM 1,3bisPGA (generating system). In B, the enzyme was preincubated in the same way with 50 mM 1,3bisPGA plus 20 mM DTT for 60 min, desalted, and then incubated with 0.14 mM NAD overnight. For elution, the same buffer as in A was used, but with 0.14 mM NAD instead of the 1,3bisPGA. The initial velocity of NAD(P)-GAPDH activity in the standard assay ( ) and the protein content (l) were determined in the fractions.

This investigation has concentrated on the characterization of the various apparent activation states of purified spinach chloroplast NAD(P)-GAPDH. Various metabolite effectors and reductants have been used alone or in combination to induce changes in the state of the enzyme. It was the aim of this work to investigate the interaction between the reductive modification and the influence of positive and negative metabolic effectors, to obtain a better understanding of how the

REGULATION OF SPINACH CHLOROPLAST NAD(P)-GAPDH

207

activation state of the NAD(P)-GAPDH is adjusted in vivo. The study has disclosed that there is little activation achieved by reduction alone, but activation by the effectors ATP, NADP, and 1,3bisPGA alone or together with a reductant is significant. In this way, four different forms of the NAD(P)-GAPDH can be described that differ in molecular mass, redox state, and their apparent activities (Figs. 1 and 3­5). The observed increases in the apparent activity of the NAD(P)-GAPDH by reduction and by metabolites are caused in different ways. Upon reduction, no change in the molecular weight is observed, while metabolic effectors cause dissociation of the enzyme. The molecular basis of this activation involves an interconversion between enzyme forms exhibiting low and high substrate affinities, respectively. The low-affinity form is the 600-kDa oligomer, the high-affinity form is the 150-kDa heterotetramer. Upon incubation of the oxidized enzyme with 1,3bisPGA, a mixture of high- and low-molecular-weight forms is obtained. It is not yet known whether this interconversion is due to some kind of covalent modification or is a noncovalent change of enzyme conformation. As far as the reductive modification of the NAD(P)-GAPDH which regulates its interaction with the effector 1,3bisPGA, the active-site cysteine cannot be involved in this reaction, since catalysis would then not be observed at all for the oxidized enzyme even at high substrate concentrations. However, it is possible that the additional C-terminus of the subunit B is involved in the mechanism of dissociation/ aggregation (21). In contrast to the activation constants for the other metabolic effectors (NADP, NADPH, or ATP), only the Ka for 1,3bisPGA is influenced upon reduction. The Ka of the oxidized enzyme is about 10 to 20 times higher than that of the reduced enzyme. NAD, NADH, and GAP are reported to reverse the dissociation of the NAD(P)-GAPDH (5). In the stroma of isolated chloroplasts, only NAD occurs at significant concentrations. The actual concentration of NAD in the stroma is about 0.14 mM (C. Kitzmann, Berlin, personal communication). Here we show that even in the presence of 0.14 mM NAD, 1,3bisPGA acts in the same way. This is in contrast to ATP, NADP, and NADPH. Activation (and dissociation) of the enzyme by these effectors could not be observed in the presence of NAD (Fig. 2). In addition, some of these compounds are active only at rather high concentrations which are not present in the stroma of the chloroplasts. Furthermore, in vivo the concentrations of these components do not change drastically between dark and light (22, 23). Since the enzyme does not exhibit a changed susceptibility for these effectors upon reductive modification, the only metabolic factor inducing activation in vivo should be 1,3bisPGA (Table III). The principle of regulation is thus a shift in KM as

is also the case for the reductive inactivation of chloroplast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (24). Different from the mechanism that underlies the redox-modulation of the other light-modulated chloroplast enzymes is the fact that reduction only increases the sensitivity of the enzyme toward its metabolic activator 1,3bisPGA, but is not necessarily required for the activation. This is reminiscent of the regulatory behavior of the chloroplast coupling factor CF1 which also can become active even in the absence of a reducing agent, but then requires a much larger DpH (25). Extrapolating to the in vivo situation this would mean that in the dark, where the NAD(P)-GAPDH occurs as the oxidized 600-kDa hexadecamer, activation cannot proceed because the 1,3bisPGA concentration in the stroma is much too low (26). Activation by other metabolites is prevented by NAD. Therefore, no oxidation of DHAP and GAP formed during starch degradation can occur, and mainly triose-P is exported to the cytosol. The crucial step of the Calvin cycle, namely triose-P production, is highly facilitated under light conditions, requiring a relatively low level of both reductant and effector to initiate 1,3bisPGA reduction. In the light, the generation of reductant (reduced thioredoxin) will allow reductive modification to occur and subsequently decrease the activation constant for 1,3bisPGA so that NAD(P)-GAPDH dissociation and activation can occur, as has been demonstrated in detail for the enzyme in isolated intact spinach chloroplasts (14). Upon illumination, the 1,3bisPGA level increases due either to a transiently rising ATP content during induction or to the increasing 3PGA concentration at steady state, and at the same time the susceptibility of the enzyme for activation by this effector increases as a consequence of reduction. This type of control of enzyme activity ensures that during steady-state photosynthesis, as long as there is enough reductant, the activation state of the NAD(P)-GAPDH is adjusted to the actual metabolic situation by the degree of dissociation as caused directly by the concentration of its substrate 1,3bisPGA. The required reductant need not necessarily be thioredoxin, since less strong reducing agents such as GSH are also effective in vitro (Fig. 1).
