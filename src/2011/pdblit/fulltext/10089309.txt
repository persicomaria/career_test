Structures of thrombin retro-inhibited with SEL2711 and SEL2770 as they relate to factor Xa binding
Most thrombin active-site inhibitors form a short antiparallel -strand with residues Ser214±Gly216. However, the Selectide Corp. inhibitors SEL2711 and SEL2770 bind to thrombin in a retro fashion, making a parallel -strand with Ser214±Gly216 similar to other retro-binding inhibitors. The crystallographic structures of thrombin±hirugen complexed with SEL2711 and SEL2770, which are isostructural with the binary thrombin± hirugen complex, have been determined and re®ned in the Ê 9.0±2.1 A resolution range to ®nal R values of 16.5 and 16.7%, respectively. The structures of the SEL2711 and SEL2770 complexes contain 131 and 104 water molecules, respectively, both of which correspond to occupancies of greater than 0.5. The l-4-amidinophenylalanyl residues of SEL2711 and SEL2770 are ®xed at the S1 speci®city site, utilizing favorable ionic and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the N atoms of the amidino group and the side-chain O atoms of Asp189. The Glu192 residue of thrombin adopts an extended conformation, which allows the l-cyclohexylglycyl residue in the P2 retro-binding position of the inhibitors to occupy a similar site to the P3 aspartate in thrombin platelet-receptor peptides bound to thrombin. The N-terminal acetyl group of both inhibitors is located in the S2 subsite, while the l-3pyridyl-(3-methyl)-alanyl of SEL2711 and the l-(N,Ndimethyl)lysine of SEL2770 occupy the S3 d-Phe subsite of d-PheProArg chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) in the thrombin±PPACK complex. The two C-terminal residues of SEL2711 (leucine and proline) point into the solvent and have no electron density in the thrombin complex. Those of SEL2770 are also positioned into the solvent, but surprisingly produce weak electron density with high B values (hBi = Ê 50 A2). Since the Selectide inhibitors are about 104 times more speci®c for factor Xa, modeling retro-binding to the latter suggests that the selectivity can be a consequence of interactions of the inhibitors in the S3±S4 binding subsites of factor Xa.

1. Introduction
Under normal physiological conditions, the blood of higher organisms is maintained in a ¯uid state. Upon vascular injury, the hemostatic system is primed to stop the loss of blood by sealing off the site of the injury and beginning the process of tissue repair. Thrombin, a multifunctional serine protease, plays a central role in the blood-coagulation cascade by performing a number of functions, exhibiting both coagulant and anticoagulant activities. As a coagulant, thrombin activates platelets, cleaves ®brinogen to form ®brin and converts coagulation factors V, VII, VIII, XI and XIII to their active forms (Colman et al., 1994). Bound to thrombomodulin,

thrombin subsequently activates protein C, which acts as an anticoagulant by converting factors Va and VIIIa to inactive forms in the presence of the cofactor protein S (Esmon, 1993). Another prominent serine protease of the coagulation cascade is factor Xa, generated through limited proteolysis of factor X by either the tissue-factor±factor VIIa complex of the extrinsic pathway (Osterud & Rapaport, 1977; Silverberg et al., 1977) or the X-ase complex, consisting of factors IXa and VIIIa, Ca2+ ion and phospholipid, of the intrinsic pathway (Stern et al., 1985). Among all the obligatory feedback mechanisms of the blood-coagulation cascade, factor Xa activates the tissue-factor±factor VII complex and physiologically converts prothrombin to thrombin through the prothrombinase complex of factors Xa and Va, Ca2+ ion and phospholipid (Mann et al., 1990). From a purely isolated standpoint based on the hierarchy of the stepwise coagulation process and the proteolytic functions of thrombin and factor Xa, both enzymes are attractive targets for inhibition based on drug design. Thrombin owes its unique role in coagulation to its having three independent binding sites ± the active site, the ®brinogen-recognition exosite and the heparin-binding exosite ± or four sites, if the Na+ ion binding site is counted (Tulinsky, 1996). The highly electropositive ®brinogen-recognition site assists in the divalent association of the natural substrate ®brinogen and the potent natural inhibitor hirudin to thrombin. Another highly electropositive site binds heparin, a prominent antithrombotic agent and cofactor which produces a 50 000-fold acceleration of the rate of inhibition of the active site of thrombin by antithrombin III (Olson & Bjork, 1992). An allosteric change from a kinetically slow to fast form accompanying binding of an Na+ ion affects the energetics of the active site of thrombin (Wells & Di Cera, 1992); ®brinogen binds to the fast form with high af®nity and is cleaved with higher speci®city (Mathur et al., 1993), while the slow form activates the anticoagulant protein C more speci®cally (Dang et al., 1995). The Na+ binding site has been identi®ed and characterized crystallographically with the aid of diffusion exchange of the Na+ ion with an Rb+ ion (Zhang & Tulinsky, 1997). As members of the trypsin-like serine-protease family, the active sites of thrombin and factor Xa possess the catalytic triad His57±Asp102±Ser195 (chymotrypsinogen numbering; Bode et al., 1992). Two insertion loops, one at position 60 and the other at position 149, partially occlude the active site of thrombin and are responsible for some of the restricted speci®city of thrombin compared with trypsin (Locht et al., 1997). Thrombin active-site inhibitors divide into two principal groups according to their binding orientation (antiparallel or parallel -strand) with respect to residues Ser214± Gly216. The antiparallel group, also operative with factor Xa, consists of a variety of inhibitors which mimic natural substrates at the P1±P3 positions, the archetypes being d-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginyl chloromethylketone (PPACK) for thrombin (Bode et al., 1992) and glutamyl-glycyl-arginyl chloromethylketone for factor Xa, along with a large number of other small peptide inhibitors (Balasubramanian, 1995). À This particular group also includes argatroban (2R,4R)-4methyl-1{N-[(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinyl)sulfÁ onyl]-l-arginyl}-2-piperidine carboxylic acid and NAPAP [N-(2-naphthyl-sulfonyl-glycyl)-d-p-amidinophenylalanylpiperidine] (Brandstetter et al., 1992), which form an antiparallel -strand even though their binding mode is different at the S1H ±S3 subsites (Mathews & Tulinsky, 1995). The second group of thrombin inhibitors consists of hirudin-like activesite-binding inhibitors (Maraganore et al., 1990; Rydel et al., 1991), which show a retro-binding mode of association with thrombin by forming a parallel -strand with Ser214±Gly216, such as the synthetic peptide BMS-183507 (Fig. 1a; Tabernero et al., 1995), the natural product Nazumamide A (Fig. 1b; Nienaber & Amparo, 1996) and a RPPGF breakdown fragment of bradykinin (unpublished results of this laboratory). A class of tri- to octapeptide competitive inhibitors of factor Xa has recently been identi®ed from the screening of a large combinatorial library (Ostrem et al., 1998). The consensus sequence is Tyr±Ile±Arg±X, where X is a hydrophobic amino acid and isoleucine is replacable with leucine. The minimal sequence is the ®rst three residues and may be replaced by homologous non-natural amino acids. Some of these have been shown to inhibit hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates of factor Xa, but bind to the enzyme differently to substrate so that Ser195 of the catalytic triad does not attack the carbonyl group at the P1 position (Ostrem et al., 1998). Selectide Corp.1 inhibitors SEL2711 and SEL2770 (Fig. 1c) are members of this class of combinatorially designed potent active-site inhibitors of factor Xa which are also highly selective against thrombin and other blood proteases (Table 1), exhibiting dose-dependent ef®cacy following both intravenous and oral administration in a rat arteriovenous shunt thrombosis model. A reverse binding mode, similar to N-terminal hirudin active-site binding to thrombin, was suggested to explain the selectivity of this class of inhibitors (Ostrem et al., 1998). However, from an NMR study of two of the inhibitors, Ac-Tyr±Ile±Arg±Ile± Pro-NH2 and Ac-(4-amino-Phe)±(cyclohexyl-Gly)±Arg-NH2 (peptides A and B, respectively), bound to the active site of factor Xa (Fraternali et al., 1998), the authors showed that `the inhibitors assume a compact, very well de®ned conformation, embedded into the substrate binding site not in the same way as a substrate'. It was also not a retro-binding mode, but had the arginine inserted in the S1 speci®city site. Diffusion of the SEL2711 and SEL2770 inhibitors into crystals of factor Xa proved unsuccessful, probably because the active site is blocked by a substrate-like intermolecular interaction (Padmanabhan et al., 1993), and co-crystallization attempts with the inhibitors did not produce crystals. This led us to soak the inhibitors into thrombin±hirugen (sulfated Tyr63±N-acetyl-hirudin 53±64) crystals in an effort to possibly establish and corroborate the different binding mode in thrombin and then model it as it might occur in factor Xa. We report here the crystal structures of thrombin complexes of SEL2711 and SEL2770 as they may relate to those of factor Xa. The re®ned structures of the thrombin-inhibited

complexes show that the inhibitors bind in a parallel -strand manner with Ser214±Gly216, which is markedly different from the binding of peptides A and B determined by NMR (Fraternali et al., 1998). A proposed retro-binding mode of SEL2711 and SEL2770 to factor Xa could account for its much higher speci®city for factor Xa compared to thrombin.

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystallization

An approximately tenfold molar excess of hirugen was added to a frozen sample of human -thrombin solution (1.0 mg mlÀ1 in 0.75 M NaCl) at 277 K to form a 1:1 thrombin±hirugen complex and to prevent autocleavage of the enzyme. The solution of the complex was concentrated to about 3.5 mg mlÀ1 using a Centricon 10 concentrator with a molecular-weight cutoff of 10 kDa in a refrigerated centrifuge at 277 K. The thrombin±hirugen complex was crystallized using the hanging-drop crystallization method in a 4 ml drop, consisting of 2 ml of the protein sample and 2 ml of a well solution. The well solution contained 28% PEG (polyethylene glycol) 8000 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.3. A

repetitive macroseeding technique was applied to enlarge the crystals. X-ray diffraction quality crystals with dimensions 0.25 Â 0.20 Â 0.20 mm were transferred into a protein-free storing drop containing 32% PEG 8000 in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.3. The SEL2711 and SEL2770 inhibitors were soaked into thrombin±hirugen crystals separately. A 1 ml aliquot of a 20 mM solution containing the inhibitor was added to the storing drop and 1 ml of the resulting solution was removed from the drop at intervals of 10±12 h for 5 d until the ®nal concentration of inhibitor in the drop was about 15 mM.

2.2. Intensity data collection

X-ray diffraction data of the ternary SEL2711± and SEL2770±thrombin±hirugen complexes were collected with an R-AXIS II imaging-plate detector. The radiation generated from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator operating at 5 kW power with a ®ne-focus ®lament (0.3 Â 3.0 mm) was monochromated (Cu K) and intensi®ed by focusing with Yale mirrors (Molecular Structure Corp.). The crystal-todetector distance was 10.0 cm and the detector-swing angle Ê was 0 . Both crystals scattered X-rays to 2.1 A resolution, although the diffraction pattern of the SEL2770 complex was considerably weaker (Table 2). Autoindexing and processing of the measured intensity data were carried out with the Rigaku R-AXIS software package (Higashi, 1990). The intensity data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 2.
2.3. Structure determination

bound inhibitor were subjected to additional cycles of PROFFT re®nement. Thereafter, the data were expanded to Ê Ê the resolution range 9.0±2.5 A and subsequently to 2.1 A + resolution, two Na ions were located and solvent water molecules were progressively found and added by examining difference density maps. The ®nal structure of thrombin complexed with SEL2711 contained 131 molecules of water with occupancies () > 0.5, R = 16.5% (resolution range 9.0± Ê Ê 2.1 A) and hBi = 26.8 A2. The ®nal SEL2770 structure contained 104 water molecules with  > 0.5 re®ned to R = Ê Ê 16.7% (resolution range 9.0±2.1 A) and hBi = 34.8 A2. Both + complexes also contain two Na ions, one intramolecular and one intermolecular, essentially identical to those previously described (Zhang & Tulinsky, 1997). The ®nal re®nement statistics of the complexes are presented in Table 3.

The crystal structure of the SEL2711 complex was determined using thrombin coordinates from the isostructural binary thrombin±hirugen complex (PDB code 1HAH; Vijayalakshmi et al., 1994). The initial coordinates were optimized by rigid-body re®nement using the X-PLOR program È package (Brunger, 1992) to an R value of 30.4% (resolution Ê range 7.0±2.5 A), followed by three cycles of coordinate and Ê overall B re®nement with a starting B value of 30.0 A2 using the program PROFFT (Hendrickson, 1985; Finzel, 1987), after which the R factor was 27.4% . After six cycles of individual temperature-factor re®nement, the R value converged at 21.6%. The crystal structure of the SEL2770 complex was solved with the coordinates of thrombin from the re®ned thrombin± SEL2711 structure as starting coordinates. After three cycles of overall and six cycles of individual B re®nement, the R Ê value was 20.0% (resolution range 7.0±2.5 A). Both complexes at this stage showed electron density corresponding to hirugen and the active-site inhibitors (which were omitted from calculations) in 2Fo À Fc electron-density maps and Fo À Fc difference density maps. In each case, the thrombin model and

The electron density is well de®ned for most of the residues of thrombin in both complexes, with the exception of the termini of the A chain (residues 1H±1B, 14K±15) and the autolysis loop (residues 148±149E), which are typically disordered in other isomorphous thrombin structures. The two complexes show no large conformational differences from each other or from other thrombin structures. The r.m.s.d. (root-mean-square deviation) of CA positions between the Ê two structures is 0.25 A for 253 atom pairs. Comparing the thrombin structures of the ternary complexes with that of the binary thrombin±hirugen complex (PDB code 1HAH) gives Ê r.m.s.d.s of 0.21 and 0.30 A for the SEL2711 and SEL2770 complexes, respectively. Ramachandran plots of the SEL2711 and SEL2770 complexes show that 196 (81.7%) and 189 (78.8%) residues of the total 240 non-glycine and non-proline amino acids of thrombin, respectively, are in the most favored regions, while 44 (18.3%) and 51 (21.2%) residues, respectively, occupy additionally allowed areas.

The l-S3 site is surface exposed and of considerable size (Fig. 3); the Chg2 residues do not superpose on the aspartate position of the former complex, but are located adjacent to it, and even appear to be in approximately orthogonal orientations (Fig. 3; 11 = 173 and 71 for SEL2711 and SEL2770, respectively). Both the Chg2 groups of SEL2711 and SEL2770 and the aspartate group of thrombin platelet-receptor peptide point into solvent space. The aspartate, however, makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Arg221A to stabilize its orientation (Ni et al., 1992; Mathews & Tulinsky, 1995), while the Chg2 groups cover the S1 site and appear to interact with the phenyl pAph1 group in the speci®city site and the disul®de bridge of Cys191±220. Thus, the Chg2 groups assume the usual role of Glu192 (bent conformation covering S1) and in the process make close contacts with Cys191 S and Cys220 S, providing a more hydrophobic environment for the latter by Figure 2 expelling some water molecules from the region.

speci®c contacts, being positioned on the surface of thrombin, which allows the P2 Chg2 group of the inhibitors to occupy the same site as the P3 aspartate of the thrombin±thrombin plateletreceptor peptide complex. Superposition of the Selectide inhibitors and the thrombin retro-binding BMS-183507 inhibitor (PDB code T5161) reveals a practically identical parallel -strand association of the backbone of the inhibitors with the Ser214±Gly216 residues of thrombin (Fig. 4). Like PPACK, BMS-183507 forms three hydrogen bonds with Ser214 O, Gly216 N and Gly216 O of thrombin, while the Selectide inhibitors form only two (Table 4). The additional hydrogen bond of BMS-183507 is accomplished by the different positioning of the terminal amide group. The arginyl-like group of the BMS inhibitor has one C atom less than an arginyl side chain, so its entrance to the speci®city site leads to a bowed conformation, which positions the terminal amide within hydrogen-bonding distance of Ser214 O (Fig. 4). The N-terminal arginyl-like moiety and phenyl group of BMS183507 bind in the speci®city pocket and S2 site, respectively, whereas the S1 site is occupied by the Aph1 group of the Selectide inhibitors while the N-terminal acetyl group is in the S2 position (Fig. 4). In addition, the BMS and Selectide inhibitors display different binding modes within the S1 site. Only one of the N atoms of the guanidine of BMS183507 makes contact with a carboxylate O atom of Asp189, while the other hydrogen bonds to Gly219 O as in the Selectide inhibitors (Fig. 4; Table 4). Since the structures of thrombin and factor Xa Ê are similar (r.m.s.d. = 1.2 A, 198 C-atom pairs), especially in the active-site regions, it is quite possible that the retro-binding mode of the Selectide inhibitors with thrombin may also be operative with factor Xa. This was explored by transposing the thrombin-bound Selectide inhibitors onto the active site of factor Xa (Fig. 5). The principal sequence differences in the resides surrounding the S1±S3 binding subsites of the two enzymes are Leu99, Ile174 and Glu192 of thrombin, which are replaced by Tyr99, Phe174 and Gln192 in factor Xa. An even larger difference is the absence in factor Xa of the 60-insertion loop of thrombin. The Tyr60A±Trp60D segment of the loop projects out over the S2 and d-enantiomorphic S3 binding sites in thrombin, restricting their access and thus contributing to speci®city. Theoretical considerations have led to the proposal of cation-%-electron-mediated interactions (Dougherty & Stauffer, 1990) in the S4 binding site of factor Xa (Lin & Johnson, 1995), where the %-faces of the three aromatic residues

Tyr99, Phe174 and Trp215 are suf®ciently rich in % electrons that they not only form a hydrophobic pocket but also act as a cation-recognition site.5 Thus, the charge interaction is basically an attraction of a positive charge to the %-electrons of the aromatic rings, alternatively called an ion-quadrupole attraction (Stauffer et al., 1990; Schwabacher et al., 1993). The cation-%-electron-binding hypothesis was modi®ed somewhat with the structure determination of the DX-9065a (Daiichi compound) inhibited structure of factor Xa (Brandstetter et al., 1996), which showed that the above aryl-binding site was further assisted by the carbonyl O atoms of Lys96±Glu97 and the side chain of the latter to form a so-called cation hole which expands the S4 binding-site region. It is noteworthy that the main chain of factor Xa between residues 94±98 is positioned differently in thrombin owing to an insertion in the vicinity of Glu97A of the latter. In the absence of the insertion, Lys96±Glu97 of factor Xa make closer contacts with groups binding at the d-S3 site. It is also noteworthy that the Arg93±Arg101 stretch has been implicated in thrombin± heparin binding (Tulinsky, 1996) by electrostatic potentialenergy calculations (Karshikov et al., 1992) and by mutagenesis (Gan et al., 1994; Ye et al., 1994; Sheehan et al., 1994). Thus, under appropriate circumstances, the two sites (S4 and heparin) could interact with each other. If the Selectide inhibitors bind to factor Xa in a similar retro manner as with thrombin, the positively charged Pal3(Me)3 and Nlys(2Me)3 groups occupy the aryl site formed by Tyr99, Phe174 and Trp215 (Fig. 5). In the case of SEL2711, the Pal3(Me)3 group, modeled as it binds to thrombin, makes edge-to-face interactions with Tyr99 and Phe174 (Fig. 5). The latter aromatic ring systems are both parallel to the pyrrolidine ring of the inhibitor in the DX-9065a±factor Xa complex (Brandstetter et al., 1996). The different orientations could re¯ect the difference between an aromatic and aliphatic group interacting with the aryl site of factor Xa or could re¯ect a more accurate determination of orientation of the Pal3(Me)3 Ê Ê group (2.1 A resolution) compared with the pyrrolidine (3.0 A resolution). If no conformational changes occur in factor Xa on binding, the positively charged N atoms of the two SelecÊ tide inhibitors are too far away (>4.5 A) to hydrogen bond with the carbonyl O atoms of Lys96±Glu97 of the S4 cation hole. The three residues of the aryl site, however, can interact with the delocalized positive charge of the Pal3(Me)3 ring in a similar way to that described for the Daiichi compound (Brandstetter et al., 1996) to approximate a cation-%-electronmediated ion-quadrupole attraction (Lin & Johnson, 1995). Since the binding constants of the two Selectide inhibitors are practically the same for factor Xa (Table 1), the Nlys(2Me)3 group most likely achieves a similar cation %-electron-mediated interaction as the Pal3(Me)3 group of SEL2711. Conversely, if the Selectide inhibitors bind to factor Xa in a substrate-like binding mode, the amidino N atoms of the pAph1 groups of both inhibitors could form hydrogen bonds

with Lys96 O and Glu97 O of the S4 cation hole; however, the binding of the Pal3(Me)3 and Nlys(2Me)3 groups in the S1 speci®city site is clearly inferior to that of the doubly hydrogen-bonded salt bridge of pAph1 in retro binding. Thus, a retro-binding mode in factor Xa would appear to be more preferable. If the inhibitors bind in a retro manner in both thrombin and factor Xa, the difference of a factor of 1.3 Â 104 (SEL2711) and 4 Â 103 (SEL2770) in selectivity (Table 1) would arise from the contribution of the Pal3(Me)3 and Nlys(2Me)3 groups binding at the S4±S3 cation-aryl site of factor Xa. This only corresponds to 5±6 kcal molÀ1 (1 kcal molÀ1 = 4.18 kJ molÀ1), and from all appearances the site can either operate through cation-%-electron-mediated interactions (Lin & Johnson, 1995) or, with a longer inhibitor group to reach Lys96±Glu97, hydrogen bonding could also occur in the cation hole (Brandstetter et al., 1996). Two other inhibitors developed by Selectide Corp. (peptides A and B mentioned earlier), have been shown using transferred nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy (Fraternali et al., 1998) to have a very compact conformation, displaying a severe hydrophobic collapse of the P2±P3 groups in the substrate-binding site of factor Xa, but not resembling the usual substrate-binding mode. The arginine of the peptides enters the speci®city S1 site differently to substrate, in an extended but curved conformation, surprisingly forming a doubly hydrogen-bonded salt bridge with Asp189, while the P2 and P3 residues (Ile±Tyr for peptide A, Chg±4-amino-Phe for peptide B), which must be the source of the selectivity for factor Xa, interact together above the S1 site with the S2 site and Tyr99. These bound structures are very different from the retro-binding mode modeled here for SEL2711 and SEL2770, where selectivity for factor Xa appears to arise from a cationic interaction with the S3±S4 sites. The only signi®cant factor which would seem to underlie the binding difference thus appears to center around the S1 speci®city site. It has already been indicated that the Pal3(Me)3 and Nlys(2Me)3 groups of SEL2711 and SEL2770 are inferior P1 residues compared with the pAph1 group, and this is the most likely to be the reason why these inhibitors do not bind like peptides A and B. This is also generally in agreement with the weaker binding constants of peptides A and B for factor Xa, which are only 1.6 and 0.3 mM,6 respectively, and essentially result from side-chain± side-chain hydrogen-bond interactions between inhibitor and enzyme. Thus, two or more different active-site binding modes (including substrate binding) may be operative in factor Xa depending on the exact structure of the inhibitor, the selectivity of which is derived from interactions with the S4 region in the retro-binding case.

This region also corresponds to the d-enantiomorphic S3 site, which is occupied by d-Phe in the thrombin±PPACK complex. The P4, l-leucine residue of the thrombin±LDPR complex of thrombin platelet-receptor peptide also occupies this site in thrombin (Mathews & Tulinsky, 1995). Mochalkin & Tulinsky
