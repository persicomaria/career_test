[31] Carbohydrate­Lectin Cross-Linking Interactions: Structural, Thermodynamic, and Biological Studies
By Tarun K. Dam and C. Fred Brewer
Introduction

The carbohydrate moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids have been shown to be involved in a variety of biological recognition processes including cell­cell and cell­substratum interactions, fertilization, immunity, apoptosis, and metastasis of tumor cells.1­3 The composition and structures of the oligosaccharides correlate with cell differentiation and transformation. For example, the expression of oligosaccharides possessing specific Lewis blood group antigenic determinants is developmentally regulated and altered as a result of differentiation and oncogenic transformation.4 The molecular recognition properties of the oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins and glycolipids are often characterized in terms of their interactions with lectins. Binding of multivalent lectins to cells often leads to cross-linking and aggregation of specific glycoprotein and glycolipid receptors, with concomitant biological responses. For example, cross-linking of glycoconjugates on the surface of cells has been implicated in the mitogenic activities of lectins including concanavalin A (Con A),5 in the arrest of bulk transport in ganglion cell axons,6 in the molecular sorting of glycoproteins in the secretory pathways of cells,7 and in the apoptosis of activated human T cells.2 Furthermore, lectin-induced cross-linking of transmembrane glycoproteins leads to changes in their interactions with cytoskeletal proteins and concomitant alterations in the mobility and aggregation of other surface receptors.8 A number of mammalian lectins are involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis of glycoproteins,1 whereas others have been implicated in cellular recognition processes including apoptosis2 and metastasis.9

Lectins undergo two general types of cross-linking interactions with multivalent carbohydrates, designated as type 1 and type 2 complexes.10 In a type 1 complex, binding between a divalent lectin and a divalent carbohydrate results in one-dimensional cross-linking (e.g., helical). In a type 2 complex, binding between a multivalent lectin and multivalent carbohydrate, where the valency of either the lectin or carbohydrate is greater than two, results in two-dimensional (planar or tubular) or three-dimensional cross-linking (crystalline, in some cases). Importantly, type 2 interactions can lead to the formation of homogeneous cross-linked complexes, even in the presence of mixtures of the molecules.10 Hence, type 2 interactions can be an important source of binding specificity between lectins and glycoconjugate receptors. There are several reports of X-ray crystal structures of lectin­carbohydrate cross-linked complexes.11­15 In general, multivalent protein­carbohydrate interactions increase the affinity and specificity of monovalent interactions by two means. First, multivalent carbohydrate binding to a lectin possessing multiple subsites per subunit results in large increases in the affinity of interaction.16 Second, binding of a multivalent carbohydrate to a lectin possessing a single binding site per subunit can result in smaller increases in affinity, and, under the appropriate stoichiometric conditions, cross-linking of lectin molecules by the carbohydrate leading to type 1 or 2 complexes.10 Because of the importance in understanding the structural and thermodynamic basis of lectin­ carbohydrate cross-linking interactions and their biological significance, a combination of methods including quantitative precipitation analysis, precipitation kinetics, electron microscopy (EM), X-ray powder diffraction, model building, X-ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and confocal microscopy has been employed to study these interactions. These methods, their applications, and findings are discussed below.

Quantitative Precipitation Analysis

Methods Multivalent Lectin­Oligosaccharide and Lectin­Glycopeptide CrossLinked Complexes. Increasing amounts of an individual oligosaccharide or glycopeptide are added to a series of tubes containing fixed amounts of lectin. The final volume of each tube is made identical with buffer and the solution is allowed to stand until equilibrium is attained. The precipitate is collected after centrifugation, washed with cold buffer, and dissolved with competing monosaccharide. The amount of total lectin precipitated is determined from the absorbance at 280 nm or from radioactivity (if the lectin is labeled). In addition, the concentration of lectin in the supernatants is measured to check the percentage of lectin precipitated (Fig. 3A and B).17,18 The concentration of oligosaccharide or glycopeptide in the precipitates is determined by phenol sulfuric acid assay or radioactivity (if the ligand is labeled). If a binary mixture of oligosaccharides or glycopeptides is used to precipitate a lectin, single or parallel experiments can be performed, depending on the labeling status of the ligands and lectin. One or both oligosaccharides or glycopeptides are labeled with 3H or 14C in each experiment (Figs. 3D and 4B).19,20 If a single oligosaccharide or glycopeptide is used for a binary mixture of two lectins, one or both lectins may be labeled with 3H or 14C (Fig. 3C).20 Multivalent Lectin­Glycoprotein Cross-Linked Complexes. Increasing amounts of 3H or 14C-labeled glycoprotein are placed into a series of tubes and buffer is added to make the volumes equal. A fixed amount of labeled lectin (3H or 14C, depending on the label of glycoprotein) is then added to each tube. Precipitation is allowed until equilibrium is reached. The supernatant is removed after centrifugation and the precipitate is washed three times with cold buffer. After the final washing, the precipitate is dissolved in buffer containing competitive monosaccharide. The solutions are then analyzed for total protein content (absorbance) as well as radioactivity (Fig. 4A).21 When a binary mixture of two glycoproteins is assayed with a lectin, parallel experiments are performed with the glycoproteins alternately labeled and tested against labeled lectin.22

Quantitative precipitation experiments can be performed under different conditions including different buffers, temperature, and salt concentrations. The reaction time can vary from 1 to 96 h. The final reaction volumes range from 100 to 1000 l. Oligosaccharides, glycopeptides, glycoproteins, and lectins are labeled with 3H or 14C by reductive methylation.23 Table I presents some of the labeling requirements in different types of quantitative precipitation assays. Results Various aspects of cross-linking interactions of multivalent oligosaccharides and glycoproteins with lectins can be studied by quantitative precipitation analysis. Cross-Linking of Lectins with Oligosaccharides and Glycopeptides. Quantitative precipitation assays show that d-galactose-specific lectins from Ricinus communis (agglutinin I) (RCA-I), Erythrina indica (EIL), Erythrina arborescens (EAL), and Glycine max (soybean) (SBA) are cross-linked and precipitated by tri- and tetraantennary complex-type oligosaccharides containing nonreducing terminal galactose residues (Fig. 1). The presence or absence of a bisecting GlcNAc in biantennary complextype oligosaccharides has little effect on the binding activities and valencies of the carbohydrates, in contrast to the results found with Con A as described below. Asialofetuin glycopeptide 7 also precipitates RCA-I and EIL, and is trivalent in both cases, as is corresponding oligosaccharide 4. The ratio of concentration of oligosaccharide or glycopeptide and the concentration of lectin monomer at the equivalence zone (region of maximum precipitation) gives the valency of the carbohydrate to the lectin

(Fig. 3).24 For RCA-I, EIL, EAL, and SBA, the ratios of the concentrations of the triantennary oligosaccharides 3 and 4 to protein monomers are approximately 1:3 (trivalent). Compound 5 is tetravalent for EIL, EAL, and SBA but trivalent for RCA-I.17 The valency of a carbohydrate is often equal to the number of its different chains containing the binding epitope, although in some instances structural valency may be different from functional valency. Branching patterns, chain lengths, affinity, and valency of the carbohydrate and the structures of lectins influence the extent of their precipitation. High mannose-type glycopeptides 9, 10, and 11 and the bisected hybridtype glycopeptide 12 (Fig. 2) are capable of specifically binding and precipitating Con A and are divalent for the lectin (Fig. 3B). Nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) measurements show that these glycopeptides as well as 13 bind primarily by the trimannosyl moiety on their (1-6) arms (primary site). However, unlike 9­12, 13 fails to precipitate the protein under the same conditions because 13 has the primary (high-affinity)

Changes in the structures and affinities of both the primary and secondary sites of the glycopeptides influence their precipitation activities. These findings may provide insight into the relationship between the microheterogeneity of N-linked carbohydrates and their specificity as cell surface receptors associated with their cross-linking activities.25 Bisected complex-type oligosaccharides such as 15 are also bivalent for Con A whereas the nonbisected analogs such as 14 are univalent for the lectin.

bisected complex-type carbohydrates bind with different mechanisms and conformations.26 The presence of the bisecting GlcNAc residue in complex type carbohydrates has profound influence on their mode of binding to Con A, but the presence of the same in hybrid-type glycopeptides (such as 12) has little effect on their interactions. Cross-Linking of Lectins with Glycoproteins. Quantitative precipitation analysis of the interactions of Con A with the soybean agglutinin (SBA), which is a tetrameric glycoprotein possessing a single Man-9 oligomannose chain (16) per monomer, shows that SBA forms two different types of cross-linked complexes (1:1 and 2:1) with tetrameric Con A, depending on the relative ratio of the two molecules in solution. However, SBA forms only 1:1 cross-linked complexes with dimeric forms of Con A (Fig. 4A). Thus the total valency of the carbohydrate of SBA is a function of both the quaternary structure of Con A as well as the relative ratio of SBA to Con A. In addition, the individual Man-9 oligosaccharide, which as a glycopeptide is bivalent for binding to Con A, expresses univalency when present on the protein matrix of SBA.21 Galectin-1 from calf spleen and galactose-specific plant lectins such as EIL, Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL), and SBA form specific cross-linked complexes with asialofetuin (ASF), a 48-kDa monomeric glycoprotein that contains three N-linked oligosaccharides 7. Formation of 1:9 and 1:3 stoichiometric cross-linked complexes (per monomer) of ASF to galectin-1, depending on their relative ratio in solution, has been documented.27 Three triantennary N-linked complex-type oligosaccharide chains of ASF mediate the cross-linking interactions, and each chain expresses either trivalency in the 1:9 cross-linked complex or univalency in the 1:3 complex (Fig. 5B). The two dimeric Erythrina lectins also form 1:9 and 1:3 ASF:lectin cross-linked complexes. In the presence of tetrameric SBA, only a 1:3 ASF:lectin cross-linked complex is formed.27 The valency of the carbohydrate chains of ASF for a series of Gal-specific plant lectins and an animal lectin is determined by (1) the number and composition of the carbohydrate chains on ASF, (2) the quaternary structure and size of the lectins, and (3) the relative ratio of the glycoprotein to lectin in solution. Formation of Unique Cross-Linked Complexes in Mixed Precipitation Systems. Evidence that specific lectins form homogeneous cross-linked lattices with multivalent carbohydrates can be obtained in mixed quantitative precipitation experiments. For example, the galactose-specific lectins from EIL and RCA-I show two separate peaks, respectively, in their

ECL, RCA-I, and SBA in the presence of a single multivalent oligosaccharide show evidence for the formation of separate cross-linked lattices between each lectin and the carbohydrate (Fig. 3C).20 The relative precipitation maxima of the oligosaccharides=glycopeplycopeptides is determined by mass action equilibria involving competitive binding of the two carbohydrates to the protein. These equilibria, in turn, are sensitive to the relative amounts and affinities of the carbohydrates at both their primary and secondary binding sites. Mixed quantitative precipitation studies show that Con A forms the same unique stoichiometry cross-linked complexes with ovalbumin and glycoprotein lectins (LTL-A, ECL, EcorL, and SBA) in the presence of binary mixtures of the glycoproteins. These results provide evidence that each glycoprotein forms a unique homogeneous cross-linked lattice(s) with Con A in the presence of another glycoprotein (Fig. 5A).22 Similarly, the dimeric galectin-1 forms homogeneous aggregated cross-linked complexes with ASF in the presence of other lectins with similar specificities and cross-linking activities.29 These findings indicate that specific lectin may bind to the carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugate receptors (glycoproteins and glycolipids) and cross-link them into homoaggregates in the presence of other carbohydrates or lectins. Indeed, evidence indicates that galectin-1 forms homoaggregates of surface glycoproteins of T cells.30 It is important to note that animal lectins in general possess multimeric structures1 and are therefore potentially capable of forming cross-linked complexes with specific multivalent carbohydrate ligands, which may be important for their biological activities.
Kinetics of Precipitation

Methods Kinetics of multivalent lectin­carbohydrate precipitation are determined by monitoring the time course of development of turbidity at 420 nm in Uvonic type 17Q cells (path length, 1 cm) in a Gilford 260 spectrophotometer coupled with a Cole-Palmer (Vernon Hills, IL) model 8373-10 recorder and an Endocal RTE-9B temperature control bath. The solution of lectin is quickly stirred on the addition of oligosaccharide and the absorbance is monitored continuously until it remains constant.31

Dependence of Cross-Linking Kinetics on Several Factors. The rate and extent of cross-linking and precipitation can be studied spectrophotometrically by light-scattering measurements. Structures of the carbohydrates and lectins, their affinities, and other physical factors profoundly influence the kinetics of precipitation. For example, the presence or absence of the galactose residues in 17 and 18 does not affect the affinities of the carbohydrates for isolectins such as Lotus tetragonolobus (LTL)-A and LTL-C, but has a strong influence on the temperature sensitivity and kinetics of the precipitation reactions (Fig. 6).31

Electron Microscopic Studies of the Cross-Linked Complexes

Methods Precipitates obtained from lectin­carbohydrate cross-linking interactions are negatively stained by placing the samples on 300 mesh carbon-coated Parlodion grids which have been freshly glow discharged, touched to filter paper, floated on a drop of 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7.0, and blotted immediately. Samples are observed at 80 kV in a 1200EX electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). For freeze­fracture studies, samples are placed in a gold double-replica device, frozen in liquid freon, and fractured in a Balzers BAF301 freeze­fracture unit (Bal-Tec, Bal  zers, Switzerland) at À115 . The fracture face is shadowed at a 45 angle with platinum and stabilized with carbon. Samples are observed as described.31 Results Observation of Highly Ordered Cross-Linked Structures. Certain fucose-containing oligosaccharides, 17­19 (Fig. 6), are capable of crosslinking and precipitating with tetrameric isolectins LTL-A and LTL-C. EM of the precipitates of LTL-A shows a distinct lattice pattern for each oligosaccharide, indicating the presence of long-range order and well-defined geometry in each cross-linked complex (Fig. 8a­d). The negative stain electron micrographs of the precipitates of SBA with 1, 2, 5, and 6 show similar ordered structures. Cross-linked complexes of SBA with 20­23 show distinct patterns by electron microscopy (Fig. 9).28 X-ray crystallographic data establish that the cross-linked lattices for SBA with 20­23 are different from each other.14 The EM results with SBA demonstrate the existence of pseudo-2-fold axes of symmetry in naturally occurring and synthetic branch chain carbohydrates that correlate with observable EM patterns in their precipitates with SBA. The presence of such symmetry elements in both the carbohydrates and the lectin suggests that both types of molecules are designed to form unique homogeneous cross-linked complexes. Con A and Dioclea grandiflora lectin (DGL) also form unique EM-observable structures in complexes with mannose-containing synthetic bivalent sugars (T. K. Dam and C. F. Brewer, unpublished observations, 2002). Importantly, not all lectin­carbohydrate precipitates show observable EM patterns, even when their mixed quantitative precipitation profiles may show evidence for the formation of homogeneous cross-linking. Observation of Distinct Cross-Linked Patterns in Mixed Precipitation Systems by EM. SBA and LTL-A form unique cross-linked complexes with distinct patterns with 2 and 17, respectively, as observed by EM (Fig. 7A and B). Distinct patterns are observed for the two different

complexes even when the precipitates form in a mixed precipitation system consisting of SBA, LTL-A, and oligosaccharides 2 and 17 (Fig. 7C).32 Similarly, precipitates of SBA with a mixture of 1 and 6 show the coexistence of the individual patterns of both carbohydrates cross-linked complexes with the lectin.28 In the mixed precipitation system the formation of each oligosaccharide­lectin lattice is mutually independent. The absence of any hybrid patterns in the mixed precipitates confirms unique molecular packing interactions that stabilize each lattice.

X-ray diffraction patterns from the precipitates are obtained by radiation from a rotating anode X-ray source (RU200; Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). ° A double-mirror camera system is used (CuKa; l ¼ 1.54 A) to produce an X-ray beam with dimensions of approximately 0.3 Â 0.3 mm at the film

(diagnostic X-ray film; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Specimen-to-film distances are 70­130 mm for most experiments and the exposure times are usually 24­72 h.33 Results. All the observed reflections for the LTL-A=19 precipitate can be indexed on an orthorhombic lattice with lattice dimensions 85.1 Â 76.1 ° ° Â 121.8 A. The 76.1 Â 121.8 A dimensions correspond closely to those ° observed in electron micrographs of the lattice in projection. The 85.1-A dimension corresponds to the thickness of the two-dimensional lattice. ° Only two ``meridional'' reflections (second and third order of the 85.1-A repeat) are observed. This suggests a partial stacking of the lattices in the pellet. The remainder of the observed reflections correspond to ``equatorial'' reflections from the two-dimensional lattice. Electron Micrograph Analysis Methods. Electron micrographs of LTL-A=19 cross-linked complexes are digitized with an EC850 digital imaging camera system (Eikonix). Optical densities of the electron micrographs in the range of 0­2 OD are coded into 8 bits (integers 0­255). At the setting used, each pixel corres° ponds to 2.07 A in the structure. The areas selected from the micrographs for digital filtering contain $260 unit cells. To extract the periodic information and determine the symmetry of the lattice in projection, the electron micrographs are filtered to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. This procedure is implemented by computing the Fourier transform of the image, multiplying the transform by a set of Gaussian functions (one around each of the reciprocal lattice points), and then computing a back Fourier transform to obtain the filtered image.33 Results. The power spectrum (square of the Fourier transform) of the electron micrograph of the LTL-A=19 precipitate in Fig. 8E (enlargement of Fig. 8D) is shown in Fig. 8J. Peaks fall on a lattice with dimensions of ° approximately 1=76 Â 1=122 AÀ1. Peaks are observable to approximately ° 19-A resolution in transforms from the most highly ordered specimens. Figure 8F is a filtered image of the electron micrograph of the lattice in Fig. 8E. In the filtered images of the LTL-A lattices, the stain-excluding material is concentrated at the vertices of the intersecting lines of stainexcluding material noted in the original micrographs. The LTL-A tetramer is centered at these points. The micrograph in Fig. 8F has mirror lines through these points, corresponding to in-plane 2-fold axes in the lattice. The Con A tetramer has 222 point group symmetry and it is likely that

the LTL-A tetramer also exhibits this symmetry. One of the molecular 2fold axes probably corresponds to the observed lattice 2-fold, greatly limiting the possible models for the molecular structure of the lattice. Modeling of the lattice structure requires the identification of the crystallographic 2-fold axis and the location of the two molecular 2-fold axes that are noncrystallographic. Electron Micrograph Simulation Methods. To investigate the orientation of the LTL-A tetramer in the lattice, a computer simulation of the filtered electron micrographs is employed.33 Negative staining is simulated by computing the projected

volume of the molecules, in essence to computationally surround the protein with ``stain'' of uniform density. No attempt is made to augment the density near charged groups (which would correspond to positive staining). The structure of the protein tetramer is modeled by using the threedimensional atomic coordinates of the Con A tetramer34 giving each atom a ``weight'' proportional to its van der Waals volume. Con A tetramers are rotated computationally into orientations consistent with the lattice symmetry and then projected onto the viewing plane. Calculations are made to determine the possible effect of multiple molecular layers on the images obtained. Further, the relative positions of the two dimers making up the tetramer of LTL-A are varied as suggested by differences that have been observed in the dimer­dimer interactions among homologous leguminous lectins. Mean phase differences are used as a criterion to evaluate the quality of simulations. Results. Models of LTL-A molecules in the cross-linked lattice were  generated by rotating LTL-A dimers up to 25.0 relative to one another. The best correspondence between calculated and observed micrographs and the lowest mean phase difference occurred for a relative rotation of  the dimers of about 20 in a direction that brought them more nearly parallel to one another. Correspondence of the simulated micrograph with a filtered electron micrograph is demonstrated in Fig. 8G and B. Molecular Model Building Methods. Since the X-ray crystal structure of LTL-A is not known, the atomic coordinates of Con A, a related lectin, are used in model building. Using atomic coordinates for Con A34 obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, a fragment of the cross-linked lattice is constructed using the molecular software package FRODO on a Silicon Graphics IRIS workstation. Lattice dimensions are taken from the results of X-ray powder diffraction and the positions of the LTL-A dimers in the lattice from comparison of simulated and actual electron micrographs. Models for the lattice are examined to determine the presence of forbidden contacts and the relative positions of the carbohydrate-binding sites.33 Results. The model of the LTL-A=19 lattice presented in Fig. 8I provides substantial information about the way in which LTL-A is cross-linked by 19. The full 222 point group symmetry of the lectin is not reflected in the lattice symmetry, as only one molecular 2-fold axis is crystallographic. The structure of 19 is apparently not consistent with a lattice in which the point group symmetry of the LTL-A is optimally crystallographic. Rotation of  the LTL-A tetramer by 12 about the y axis would result in a lattice that

would correspond to a single layer of a lattice with C222 symmetry. In this lattice, the cross-linking carbohydrate would span a 2-fold axis. 19 with its  (1­6) arm in the ! ¼ 60 rotamer conformation has a pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry with respect to the outer Fuc residues, but not an exact 2-fold. The relative positions of the outer Fuc residues are consistent with the observed lattice symmetry. This can be compared with the conformation of a biantennary pentasaccharide possessing LacNAc arms linked (1­6) and (1­3) to a core Gal residue that was previously shown to bind with the  (1­6) arm in the ! ¼ 60 rotamer conformation in its cross-linked complex 14 with SBA. In this latter case, the pentasaccharide also possesses a pseudo-2-fold axis of symmetry with respect to its LacNAc moieties that is consistent with the lattice symmetry of the complex. The structure of the LTL-A=19 lattice can be compared with the structures of the cross-linked lattices formed between SBA and four biantennary pentasaccharides.13,14 In those structures, each of the four threedimensional lattices formed by SBA and the oligosaccharides is completely stabilized by carbohydrate cross-links that span the interprotein space. The presence of any protein­protein interactions at the tetramer­tetramer interface of the LTL-A=19 lattice is difficult to assess on the basis of the model constructed here. Nevertheless, the LTL-A=19 lattice is dissolved on addition of competing monovalent carbohydrate (i.e., Fuc), or prevented from forming in the presence of the monosaccharide. This indicates that the stability of the lattice is predominantly due to protein­carbohydrate interactions, as observed in the SBA=pentasaccharide lattices.14 LTL-A also forms cross-linked lattices with at least two other biantennary fucosyl oligosaccharides.31 One is similar to the lattice described here, whereas the other forms a helical aggregate in which the topology of interactions is substantially different from the present lattice. The affinity of LTL-A for all three fucosyl oligosaccharides is similar, which suggests that their interactions with the protein are similar. This suggest that differences in the overall structures of the carbohydrates account for differences in the structures of the respective cross-linked lattices. Similar findings have been observed in the structures of cross-linked lattices formed between SBA and four analogs of the blood group I carbohydrate antigen.14

complexes crystallize in space group P6422, which is the same as for the 2,6-pentasaccharide complex previously described.13 Crystals of the 2,3-pentasaccharide complex crystallize in space group I4122. X-ray diffraction data are collected on a Siemens area detector system coupled to a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode X-ray generator. The data are processed with the XENGEN software package (Siemens Analytical X-Ray Instruments, Madison, WI).14 Results The structures of SBA complexed with four pentasaccharides, 20­23, ° have been refined to approximately 2.4­2.8 A. Noncovalent lattice formation in all four complexes is promoted uniquely by the bridging action of the two arms of each bivalent carbohydrate. Association between SBA tetramers involves binding of the terminal Gal residues of the pentasaccharides at identical sites in each monomer, with the sugar(s) crosslinking to a symmetry-related neighbor molecule. While the 21, 22, and 23 complexes possess a common P6422 space group, their unit cell dimensions differ. The 20 cross-linked complex, on the other hand, possesses the space group I4122. Thus, all four complexes are crystallographically distinct. Differences in the structure of the 20­SBA lattice relative to the other three complexes can be observed in Fig. 9. The four crosslinking carbohydrates are in similar conformations, possessing a pseudo2-fold axis of symmetry which lies on a crystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry in each lattice. In the case of 22 and 23, the symmetry of their cross-linked lattices requires different rotamer orientations about their (1­6) glycosidic bonds. The results demonstrate that crystal packing interactions are the molecular basis for the formation of distinct cross-linked lattices between SBA and four isomeric pentasaccharides.14 The crystal structures of the four SBA­pentasaccharide complexes represent models for lectin­carbohydrate multidimensional clustering in vivo, and a common thermodynamic mechanism for selectively aggregating a dispersed population of multivalent receptors in biological systems. The crystallographic data together with previously described studies indicate that the carbohydrate moieties of specific glycoconjugate receptors can be cross-linked by a multivalent lectin into distinct homogeneous complexes.

software supplied by Microcal, with ÁH (enthalpy change in kcal=mol), Ka (association constant in MÀ1), and n (number of binding sites per monomer) as adjustable parameters. Unlike some common practices, the n value is never set to a predecided value; rather, it is kept as a variable parameter. The quantity c ¼ KaMt(0), where Mt(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration calorimetry.35 All experiments are performed with c values greater than 1 but less than 200. Thermodynamic parameters are calculated from the equation 4G ¼ 4H À T4S ¼ ÀRTln Ka where ÁG, ÁH, and ÁS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding, respectively. T is the absolute temperature and R ¼ 1.98 cal molÀ1 KÀ1.36 Experimental Conditions for ITC Measurements with Multivalent Sugars. At pH 7.2 and NaCl concentrations greater than 0.15 M, where Con A and DGL are tetramers, multivalent carbohydrate analogs 25­27 are observed to bind and precipitate with both proteins at lectin concentrations between 25 and 60 M and at nearly stoichimetric ratios of the sugars. Quantitative precipitation profiles of the lectins with the same sugars confirm their ability to precipitate the proteins. The precipitation reactions are inhibited by the presence of MeMan or dissolved on addition of the monosaccharide. ITC measurements, however, require the presence of a nonprecipitating environment during the titration experiment. The dimer­tetramer equilibrium of Con A has been reported to be sensitive to pH37,38 and NaCl (T. K. Dam and C. F. Brewer, unpublished observations, 2002). Therefore, ITC experiments are performed at low salt and pH (5.0), conditions under which the lectins are predominantly dimeric. A dimeric lectin does not form insoluble precipitates on binding a bivalent sugar, and the formation of precipitation with a tetravalent analog is considerably slower if the concentrations of the reactants are kept lower. By taking advantage of the higher affinities of the multivalent carbohydrates, such low-concentration titrations are performed. In particular, titrations with 25­27 are done with <20 M lectins and 150­600 M carbohydrates, significantly lower concentrations compared with those generally used in lectin­carbohydrate titrations. Time-dependent precipitation of the complex occurs with certain ligands after the run. Thus, the ITC experiments

with multivalent ligands are performed under conditions in which formation of insoluble complexes is arrested or considerably slowed and the quality of the run and fitting is excellent (Fig. 10). Results The driving force for the formation of homoaggregates of multimeric lectins with multivalent carbohydrates is solely thermodynamic. Multivalent ligands such as 1­5, 8, 9, and 16 have been shown to possess higher affinities compared with those of their monovalent analogs.17,39,40 Using several multivalent sugars (25­27) and multimeric lectins such as Con A and DGL, the thermodynamic basis of multivalent interactions has been investigated by ITC.36 As shown in Table II, the ÁH of a multivalent sugar binding to Con A (or DGL) is approximately its ITC-derived functional valency times the ÁH of its monovalent analog. The ITC data are consistent with the sequential binding of each arm (epitope) of a multivalent sugar to different lectin molecules. Therefore, the observed (macroscopic) ÁG is the average of the microscopic ÁG values of each arm of a multivalent carbohydrate. Because the microscopic ÁH is essentially identical at each arm, the increase in the observed Ka must be due to relatively more positive microscopic TÁS at certain epitope(s) compared with the monovalent analog. On the basis of these results, the microscopic Ka value of the first epitope of a multivalent carbohydrate should be greater than those of the remaining epitopes because (1) the valency of a multivalent sugar will decrease with the progression of binding and (2) binding will become more and more difficult due to cross-linking effect (Fig. 12). These conclusions are confirmed by Scatchard and Hill plot analysis of the raw ITC binding data and by reverse ITC experiments (described below).41,42 Another important parameter derived from ITC analysis of multivalent carbohydrates binding to lectins is the n value, the number of binding sites per subunit of lectin. ITC results show that the n value is directly related to the functional valency of the carbohydrates (Table II), which may differ from its structural valency.36

Scatchard and Hill Plot Analysis of ITC Raw Data

Methods The total concentration of ligand Xt(i) as well as of lectin Mt(i) after the ith injection and the heat evolved on the ith injection, Q(i), are readily available from the ITC raw data file after each experiment. The concentration correction is automatically done by Origin software. The concentration of bound ligand Xb(i) after the ith injection is Xb ðiÞ ¼ ½QðiÞ=ð4H Â V0 Þ þ Xb ði À 1Þ
À1

ð1Þ

where Q(i) (cal) is the heat evolved on ith injection, ÁH (cal mol ) is the enthalpy change, V0 (ml) is the active cell volume, and Xb (mM) is the concentration of bound ligand. Xb is equal to Mb, the concentration of bound protein, and, in the present study of multivalent ligands, the more general expression is Mb ¼ (Xb) Â (functional valency of ligand). The concentration of free ligand (Xf) after the ith injection is determined as follows: Xf ðiÞ ¼ Xt ðiÞ À Xb ðiÞ ð2Þ

For Scatchard analysis, r(i) is plotted against r(i)=Xf(i), where r(i) is [Xb(i)] Â (functional valency of ligand)=Mt(i), and Hill plots are constructed by plotting log [Y(i)=1ÀY(i)] versus log[Xf(i)], where Y(i) is [Xb(i)] Â (functional valency of ligand)=Mt(i), which are modified versions

of Scatchard and Hill plots (cf. Ref. 43) that take into account the functional valency of the ligand. Hill plots are disposed around the zero point on the ordinate as observed for monovalent mannotriose, only after multiplication with functional valencies of respective sugars. A program has been created using Microsoft Excel for construction of Scatchard and Hill plots. Work sheet data are copied from the ITC raw data file and placed in appropriate columns of the program. After calculation the program shows the profiles of Hill and Scatchard plots. Delta Graph is used for further analysis of the plots.41 The validity of the information obtained from the Hill plot [log(Y=1ÀY) versus log(Xf)] is tested by directly fitting the binding data of monovalent mannotriose to the Hill equation. The Hill slope is observed to be the same by direct fitting or plotting of the Hill equation data. Attempts at directly fitting the ITC data for the multivalent analogs fail because the Hill slope values change throughout the binding process. All the ITC raw data including those of control experiments are taken from titrations done at low and comparable concentration regimens. This has important implications for the quality of the data and subsequent explanations. Low concentration titrations inhibit precipitation and selfassociation of the molecules involved during the experiment and the use of identical experimental conditions and comparable concentrations of lectins and the carbohydrates in all experiments allow a valid comparison of the data and the profiles. As a consequence, fittings of the ITC data are excellent, which, in turn, significantly reduce the error margin in the raw data. If the raw data are taken from an ITC experiment with poor fitting, Scatchard and Hill plot profiles remain largely unreliable because of the significant error margin. The conclusions made from the present Scatchard and Hill plot analyses are experimentally confirmed by reverse ITC experiments (see below). Results Scatchard plots clearly indicate that multivalent carbohydrate binding to a lectin that results in cross-linking is associated with negative cooperativity, which is confirmed by Hill plot analysis.41 A Scatchard plot of the ITC data for monovalent 24 is linear whereas that obtained with a multivalent analog such as 27 is curvilinear (Fig. 11A and B). The concave nature of the Scatchard plot in Fig. 11B suggests that multivalent analogs bind to both lectins with negative cooperativity.

Hill plots of the binding of monovalent mannotriose to Con A and DGL are linear with slopes near 1.0, demonstrating a lack of binding cooperativity and allosteric transitions in the proteins. However, Hill plots for the binding of multivalent analogs (25­27) to both lectins are curvilinear with decreasing tangent slopes below 1.0, indicating increasing negative cooperativity on binding of the analogs to the lectins (Fig. 11C). The decreasing slope values of curvilinear Hill plots are consistent with decreasing affinity and functional valencies of the multivalent analogs on sequential binding of lectin molecules to the carbohydrate epitopes of the analogs. Figure 12 schematically presents a multivalent binding and shows how the microscopic binding constants decrease (Ka1 > Ka2 > Ka3 > Ka4). Figure 12 is overly simplified because it does not take into account the other binding site of a lectin dimer. Involvement of both binding sites of a dimeric lectin molecule would lead to cross-linking. The degree of cross-linking will increase with the progression of binding. Therefore, cross-linking can be expected to contribute to the observed negative cooperativity.
Reverse Isothermal Titration Calorimetry

Methods Reverse ITC experiments are performed to determine the microscopic binding parameters of individual epitopes, as described above, with the following exceptions. In individual titrations, injections of 4 l of Con A solution are added from the computer-controlled 100-l microsyringe at intervals of 4 min into a cell containing sugar solution (cell volume, 1.358 ml) dissolved in the same buffer as the lectin, while stirring at 350 rpm. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of Con A into a cell containing buffer with no sugar show insignificant heats of dilution.42 Results Decreasing binding affinity on sequential binding was experimentally demonstrated by reverse ITC, which determined the thermodynamics of microscopic binding parameters of a lectin for the individual epitopes of multivalent analogs.42 The reverse ITC measurements show an 18-fold greater microscopic affinity constant of Con A for the first epitope of the divalent analog 25 versus its second epitope, and a 53-fold greater microscopic affinity constant of Con A binding to the first epitope of the trivalent analog 26 versus its second epitope. The data also demonstrate that the microscopic enthalpies of binding of the two epitopes (ÁH1 and ÁH2) of 25 and 26 are essentially the same, and that differences in the

Fig. 12. Four microequilibrium constants of the tetravalent analog 27 can be represented by Ka1, Ka2, Ka3, and Ka4, for binding of a dimeric Con A molecule to the first arm of 27 (species A), to the second arm of 27 (species B), etc. Hence, the observed (macroscopic) ÁG values of 27 (ÁGobs) for Con A are the average of the four microscopic ÁG terms, or ÁGobs = (ÁG1 + ÁG2 + ÁG3 + ÁG4)=4. The relative values of ÁG1, ÁG2, ÁG3, and ÁG4 must decrease on the basis of the decreasing valencies of A, B, C, and D (which have the same valencies as tetra-, tri, bi-, and monovalent analogs). Thus, it is expected that Ka1 > Ka2 > Ka3 > Ka4 for 27 binding to Con A as shown. The increasing level of cross-linking with the progression of binding will also contribute to the decreasing microscopic binding constants.41

microscopic Ka values of the epitopes are due to their different microscopic entropies of binding (TÁS) values (Table III). These findings are consistent with the increasing negative Hill coefficients obtained during Hill plot analysis. Compared with the binding of initial epitope(s) (in which the entropy is relatively more favorable and affinity is greater because of the higher possibilities of binding and recapture), increasing cross-linking

Paraformaldehyde (2%) is added for 30 min on ice to fix the cells, and the reaction is quenched with 0.2 M glycine for 5 min on ice. The cells  are stained by incubating them for 1.5 h at 25 with a 15-g=ml concentration of each of the indicated combinations of two antibodies: 9.4 (CD45, mouse IgG2a), DFT1 (CD43, mouse IgG1), DFT1­biotin (CD43, mouse IgG1­biotin conjugated), M-T701 (CD7, mouse IgG1), LT7 (CD7, mouse IgG2a), or UCHT1 (CD3, mouse IgG1). The cells are washed and incubated  at 25 for 1.5 h with the appropriate secondary reagents: fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a, Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a, fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin, Texas Red-conjugated streptavidin, or goat anti-mouse IgG1. The cells are washed and, when required, a tertiary reagent, fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG, is added for 1.5 h at 25 . The cells are washed, dropped on glass microscope slides, and mounted with ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The fluorescently labeled cells are viewed via the Â 100 objective of a Leica (Deerfield, IL) confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). The cells are scanned by dual excitation of fluorescein (green) and Texas Red (red) fluorescence. Dual-emission fluorescent images are collected in separate channels as 0.5-m optical slices. The images are processed on a Sun Workstation using AVS (Advanced Visualization Systems, Waltham, MA) image-processing software. Areas of red and green overlapping fluorescence are represented with a yellow signal. The confocal images are printed by a Fuji (Tokyo, Japan) Pictography 3000 printer.

segregated membrane microdomains on the cell surface of susceptible T cells. In the absence of galectin-1, counter receptors CD45 and CD43 are found randomly distributed on the surface of the cells. On galectin-1 binding these receptors segregate into distinct patches (Fig. 13). CD45 and CD3 colocalized on large islands on apoptotic blebs protruding from the cell surface. These islands also included externalized phosphatidylserine. In addition, the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface of galectin-1-treated cells occurred rapidly. CD7 and CD43 colocalized in small patches away from the membrane blebs, which excluded externalized phosphatidylserine. Receptor segregation was not seen on cells that did not die in response to galectin-1, including mature thymocytes, suggesting that spatial redistribution of receptors into specific microdomains is required to trigger apoptosis.30
Conclusions

Physical studies of multivalent lectin­carbohydrate cross-linking interactions described in the present article have provided insights into a new source of binding specificity, namely, the formation of homogeneous lectin­carbohydrate cross-linked lattices. The thermodynamic bases of such interactions have also been investigated. These findings have been applied toward understanding the role of galectin-1 in binding and segregating specific counter receptors on the surface of activated T cells leading

to apoptosis.30 Hence, studies of the physical interactions of multivalent lectins with multivalent carbohydrates and glycoproteins have provided a molecular basis for understanding their structure­function roles in biological systems.

[32] Calorimetric Evaluation of Protein­Carbohydrate Affinities
By Trine Christensen and Eric J. Toone
Introduction

Protein­carbohydrate interactions control myriad biological recognition phenomena including fertilization, cell­cell recognition, immunological responses, and pathogen­host cell attachment. From a desire to control these events, significant effort has been expended toward the development of high-affinity ligands for various carbohydrate-binding proteins. On the other hand, the evaluation of protein­carbohydrate affinities is challenging. Carbohydrates lack the traditional photophysical properties typically used to measure binding phenomena. Protein­carbohydrate interactions are weak, typically in the millimolar to micromolar range, and many of the well-developed techniques for the study of ligand binding are inappropriate in this low-affinity domain. The saccharide ligands for many carbohydrate-binding proteins are scarce, and their availability is often limited by the elaborate and tedious synthetic protocols required for their preparation. In response to these challenges, a variety of competitive assays have been developed for the analysis of protein­carbohydrate binding. The most widely used of this group is the inhibition of hemagglutination, or HIA, assay.1,2 Because erythrocytes display various bound carbohydrates at high surface densities, many lectins cross-link, or agglutinate, red blood cells.
