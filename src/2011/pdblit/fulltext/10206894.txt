Crystal Structure of Human ZAG, a Fat-Depleting Factor Related to MHC Molecules
Luis M. Sanchez,1* Arthur J. Chirino,1,2* Pamela J. Bjorkman1,2 ´
Zn- 2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a soluble protein that is present in serum and other body fluids. ZAG stimulates lipid degradation in adipocytes and causes the extensive fat losses associated with some advanced cancers. The 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of ZAG resembles a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) heavy chain, but ZAG does not bind the class I light chain 2-microglobulin. The ZAG structure includes a large groove analogous to class I MHC peptide binding grooves. Instead of a peptide, the ZAG groove contains a nonpeptidic compound that may be implicated in lipid catabolism under normal or pathological conditions. ZAG is a soluble protein whose name derives from its tendency to precipitate with zinc salts and its electrophoretic mobility in the region of the 2 globulins (1). ZAG is normally present in most body fluids including serum, sweat, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, seminal plasma, milk, amniotic fluid, and urine (1). In addition, ZAG accumulates in breast cysts as well as in 40% of breast carcinomas, and is induced by glucocorticoids and androgens in breast cancer cell lines. Hence, ZAG may participate in breast diseases, including cancer (2). The function of ZAG was elucidated when a lipid-catabolizing factor with the same amino acid sequence as ZAG was isolated from the urine of cancer patients with cachexia (3). Cachexia is a wasting syndrome caused by depletion of muscle and adipose tissue that is present in the majority of patients with cancer, AIDS, and other life-threatening diseases (3). ZAG appears to be responsible for the fat-depletion component of cachexia, since it stimulates lipid breakdown in adipocytes and reduces fat stores in laboratory animals (3). ZAG is overexpressed in carcinomas that induce fat loss but not in other tumors. Application of ZAG to adipocyte membranes activates a guanosine triphosphate­dependent adenylate cyclase ac1 Division of Biology 156-29 and 2Howard Hughes Medical Institute, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA.

tivity, perhaps through direct or indirect interactions with a G protein­coupled receptor (3). Thus, its mode of action could be similar to that of lipolytic hormones. These results suggest that ZAG normally functions to regulate lipid degradation, which increases to a pathological extent in cachexia. ZAG shares 30 to 40% amino acid sequence identity with the extracellular portions of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) heavy chains (4). Class I MHC molecules present peptide antigens to cytotoxic T cells (5). Other proteins related to class I MHC molecules include CD1, which presents hydrophobic antigens to T cells (6), the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which transports immunoglobulin G across epithelia (7), and HFE, which binds transferrin receptor and regulates iron homeostasis (8). These MHC homologs are membrane-bound heterodimers that use the soluble protein 2microglobulin ( 2M) as a light chain. ZAG, however, is a secreted protein, and it does not associate with 2M (9). The latter property is shared by MIC-A, a divergent membranebound member of the class I family (10). Like FcRn (11), HFE (11), and MIC-A (10), ZAG does not bind endogenous peptides (9), but it appears to carry a small proteinase-resistant compound whose injection induces glomerulonephritis in experimental animals (12). In peptide-binding class I MHC molecules, a large groove located between two helices in the 1- 2 superdomain of the heavy chain serves as the binding site (5). An analogous groove acts as the antigen binding site in CD1,

but is narrowed in HFE and closed in FcRn, the class I­related proteins that do not bind small molecular weight ligands (11). Here, we present the 2.8 Å crystal structure of human ZAG, which reveals an MHClike fold without a 2M light chain and a groove that closely resembles the peptidebinding sites of classical class I MHC molecules. Rather than containing a peptide, the

The carbohydrate electron density at Asn239 shows nine carbohydrate residues arranged in a biantennary structure (14) (two of the carbohydrate residues are omitted from the figure for clarity). The large number of ordered carbohydrate residues at Asn239 is likely to result from stabilization of the flexible carbohydrate by crystal contacts with protein residues in symmetry-related ZAG molecules (shown in red sticks; bottom). Figures were made as described (23).

ZAG groove includes an unidentified nonpeptidic ligand that may be relevant for ZAG's function in lipid catabolism. ZAG was purified from human serum and crystallized as described (9). The crystal structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) aided by fourfold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging (Table 1) (13). The overall structure of ZAG is similar to those of class I MHC heavy chains (Fig. 1A). The 1- 2 superdomains of ZAG, class I, and class I­related proteins form a single eight-stranded antiparallel sheet topped by two helices, and the 3 domain adopts a fold resembling immunoglobulin constant domains (5, 11). Electron density corresponding to carbohydrate is present at three of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites in ZAG, with an unusually large number of ordered carbohydrate residues visible at Asn239 (Fig. 1B) (14). The 3 domain of human, but not mouse or rat, ZAG contains an RGD sequence (Arg231, Gly232, Asp233) suggested to be involved in cell adhesion (15). However, unlike the RGD sequences in characterized adhesion molecules such as fibronectin III domains (15), the ZAG RGD is located in a strand rather than a loop. The quaternary arrangement of the ZAG 3 domain with respect to the 1- 2 platform differs from that found in 2M-binding class I and class I­related proteins. The overall shape of ZAG is similar to an inverted "L," in which the long axis of the 3 domain is roughly perpendicular to the flat side of the 1- 2 platform, whereas the comparable angle is acute in 2M-binding proteins (Fig. 2A). In those proteins, 2M interacts with the 3 domain and the underside of the 1- 2 platform and is typically required for stability (16). The displacement of the ZAG 3 domain compared to its class I counterpart results in the inability of 2M to optimally contact the 3 and 1- 2 domains of ZAG (17), contributing to ZAG's lack of affinity for 2M. The high thermal stability of ZAG in the absence of 2M (9) can be explained by a network of hydrogen bonds between 3 and 1- 2 that are not present in 2M-binding class I proteins (Fig. 2B). In addition to the extra hydrogen bonds, the loop connecting strand 4 to the helical region of the ZAG 1 domain platform (residues 51 to 54) and the loop connecting strands D to E in the 3 domain (residues 236 to 241) are closer together than their class I counterparts, contributing to the burial of a larger interdomain surface in ZAG (970 Å2 total) than in classical class I molecules (660 Å2 in HLA-A2) (11). There is some flexibility in the position of the ZAG 3 domain relative to 1- 2, as demonstrated by different interdomain relationships of the four ZAG molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (Fig. 2A), yet ZAG is not particularly protease-sensitive at the platform-

Fig. 2. Structural comparisons of ZAG, class I, and class I­related proteins. (A) (Left) Comparison of the structures of ZAG and HLA-A2 (11). (Right) Comparison of the four ZAG molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit (magenta) with the heavy chains of human class I MHC (yellow; PDB codes 1hhh, 1vac, 2clr) and 2M-binding class I MHC homologs (green; FcRn, CD1, HFE) (11). Superpositions were based on the C atoms in the platform domains, using 2clr as a reference molecule. The position of the ZAG 3 domain with respect to its 1- 2 platform falls out of the range of the positions of the 3 domains of the 2M-binding class I proteins. Differences in the platform- 3 interdomain relationships in the four ZAG molecules demonstrate that there is flexibility in the position of the ZAG 3 domain relative to 1- 2. However, the overall similarity of the four molecules, which are subjected to different crystal packing forces, rule out that ZAG's shape is an artifact of crystallization. (B) Close-up comparison of the interface between 1- 2 (blue) and 3 (green) in ZAG and HLA-A2 (11). Additional H-bonds and a larger interdomain surface area stabilize ZAG compared with class I molecules, whose heavy chains are stabilized by interactions with 2M. Figures were made as described (23).

3 hinge or any other region (18). Although the quaternary structure of ZAG differs significantly from the heavy chains of class I and class I­like structures, the differences are less than anticipated from the absence of the 2M light chain. The overall similarity between ZAG and class I MHC heavy chains contrasts with the large interdomain rearrangements observed in the crystal structure of MIC-A (10). Despite the similarity between ZAG and class I molecules, structural features of the ZAG 3 domain make it unlikely to associate with the T cell coreceptor CD8. Of 15 class I heavy-chain residues identified at the CD8 binding site in the HLA-A2/CD8 cocrystal

structure (19), only one is conserved between class I and ZAG sequences (class I Asp122, ZAG Asp123) (4). It is not possible to rule out an interaction between ZAG and T cell receptors, because the class I MHC residues that contact these receptors are not particularly conserved (20). Although ZAG does not associate with peptides (9), the helices in both the 1 and 2 domains are almost identically positioned to their counterparts in peptide-binding class I MHC molecules (Fig. 3A) (21). Thus, the ZAG platform includes an open groove, by contrast to the narrowed or closed grooves observed in other class I homologs that do not bind peptides

Fig. 3. Comparisons of the grooves of ZAG, class I, and class I­related proteins. (A) Stereoview comparisons of the 1- 2 platforms of ZAG and class I proteins that contain open antigen-binding grooves. (Top) ZAG is compared with HLA-A2, a classical class I MHC molecule. "N" and "C" indicate the orientation with respect to the NH2- and COOH-termini of a peptide bound in the HLA-A2 groove. Side chains in common between the ZAG and HLAA2 grooves (Table 2) are highlighted on the C backbones. Although many of the ZAG groove residues are chemically identical to their counterparts in HLA-A2, the conformations of the side chain, the backbone, or both, of these residues are generally different; thus, the grooves have different shapes [see (B)]. (Bottom) Comparison of ZAG and CD1. Although the ZAG and CD1 grooves both bind nonpeptidic ligands, the ZAG groove is smaller and shallower. Prolines within the 2 domain helices of ZAG (Pro167) and CD1 (Pro169) are highlighted. The proline in the ZAG helix is accommodated without significant distortion (24), as previously seen for the analogous proline within the HFE helix (Pro166) (11). (B) Extruded groove pockets of ZAG and HLA-A2. Cut-away groove molecular surfaces (11) are shown from above (top) and the side (bottom) with electrostatic potentials (23), in which positive potential is blue, neutral is white, and negative potential is red. The approximate locations of pockets A through F (Table 2) are indicated on the HLA-A2 surfaces. The molecular surface of the central portion of the ZAG groove is nearly neutral except for the contribution of Arg73 and, like CD1 (11), is hydrophobic compared to the grooves of the class I molecules. Calculated groove surface areas (11) are indicated for ZAG and HLA-A2. For comparison, the groove surface areas for other MHC homologs are 1440 Å2 (CD1), 235 Å2 (FcRn), and 415 Å2 (HFE) (11).

[FcRn (11), HFE (11), and MIC-A (10)]. Despite the fact that most of the residues within the COOH-terminal portion of the ZAG 2 domain helix are chemically identical to their class I counterparts (Table 2), the ZAG groove has a different shape than a typical class I MHC peptide-binding groove (Fig. 3B). Differences in side chain conformations (Fig. 3A) and side chain substitutions create the altered shape of the ZAG groove, which can be described as containing three pockets: a large, predominantly hydrophobic central pocket and two smaller, more acidic flanking pockets (Fig. 3B). The boundary on the left of the central pocket (Fig. 3B) is created by the side chain of Arg73, which points into the groove to separate the central and left pockets. Class I MHC grooves contain a smaller side chain at this position (His70 in HLA-A2) (4). Because of Arg73 and other side chain substitutions or conformational differences relative to class I molecules, the ZAG groove cannot accommodate even a polyalanine version of an eight- or nine-residue peptide in a class I­ binding conformation (Table 2). Instead of a peptide, the ZAG groove contains an as yet unidentified ligand that cocrystallizes with the protein. Electron density that cannot be accounted for by the amino acid sequence or N-linked carbohydrates is found in the central pocket of the ZAG groove (Figs. 1A and 3C). The density is a curved nonbranched tube, lacking the characteristic protrusions of peptides, that is situated near a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids (three tryptophans, four tyrosines, an isoleucine, and two phenylalanines) and the positively charged side chain of Arg73 (Table 2). Although it is not possible to unambiguously identify the compound or compounds in the ZAG groove at the current resolution of the electron density maps, previous biochemical studies rule out that the density corresponds to peptide or mixture of peptides (9). The composition of the ZAG groove residues near the density (Table 2) suggests that it represents one or more small hydrophobic molecules, perhaps negatively charged. Chloroform-methanol extractions and acid eluates of ZAG as well as the intact protein have been analyzed by gas chromatography, electrospray, or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, or a combination of these methods (22). The ligand has not yet been detected, but in the absence of information about the chemical nature, size, and ionic state of the ligand, these results cannot be considered conclusive. Electrospray analyses of proteolytic fragments of ZAG reveal that the ligand is not covalently bound (22). Classical class I MHC molecules are extremely polymorphic, whereas ZAG exhibits species-specific variations but little or no genetic polymorphism (4, 5). Most of the allelespecific variations of class I MHC molecules map to residues within the peptide-binding groove that interact with peptides (Table 2) (5). This property of class I molecules results in allele-specific peptide-binding motifs, such that individual class I molecules show distinct preferences for binding peptides (5). In contrast, residues within the ZAG groove are mostly conserved, and those residues closest to the ZAG ligand are completely conserved (Table 2), even though human and rodent ZAG share only 56% sequence identity (4). Taken together with ZAG's lack of polymorphism, these observations imply that human and rodent ZAG carry a single compound, or single class of compounds, related to their function in lipid catabolism. The crystallographic analysis of ZAG reveals a structure with surprising similarity to classical class I molecules despite ZAG's inability to bind peptides or 2M (9). ZAG and MHC-related proteins such as FcRn (11) and HFE (11) have adapted the same basic fold to perform widely different roles within and outside of the immune system. These molecules illustrate the versatility of the MHC fold and raise intriguing questions about the ancestral function and evolutionary relationships of MHC and MHC-related proteins.

Table 2. Comparison of residues in 1- 2 grooves of ZAG and a class I MHC molecule. Uppercase letters in any of the HLA-A2 and ZAG columns indicate residues that are conserved in human class I MHC sequences (4) or residues that are conserved in human, mouse, and rat ZAG (4). Pocket residues in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-A2 are defined as having 5.0 Å2 accessible surface area to a 1.4 Å probe, but 5.0 Å2 accessible surface area to a 5 Å probe (11). HLA-A2 residues marked with an asterisk were originally defined as pocket residues by M. A. Saper et al. (11) but are accessible to a 5.0 Å probe. The HLA-A2 residues designated as "NONE" (conserved) or "none" (not conserved) do not meet the criteria for being in a pocket, but are listed for comparison with ZAG. Pocket letter names (uppercase letters, conserved residues) refer to well-characterized pockets in the peptide-binding grooves of class I MHC molecules (5, 11). ZAG residues analogous to class I pocket residues are designated as "POCKET" (conserved) or "pocket" (not conserved) if they meet the criteria for pocket residues in HLA-A2, "BURIED" or "buried" if they have 5.0 Å2 accessible surface area to a 1.4 Å probe and 5.0 Å2 accessible surface area to a 5 Å probe, and "EXPOSED" or "exposed" if they have 5.0 Å2 accessible surface area to a 1.4 Å probe and 5.0 Å2 accessible surface area to a 5 Å probe. Surface areas were calculated (11) using the coordinates of HLA-A2 (excluding water molecules and bound peptide) and ZAG. Steric clashes with polyalanine peptides bound to ZAG in their class I­ binding configuration were defined as described in the structural analysis of HFE (11).

The MIC-A 1- 2 platform is displaced from its 3 domain by 113.5° compared to class I molecules. As a result, the MIC-A 1- 2 platform makes no contact with its 3 domain [P. Li, S. T. Willie, S.

After rigid-body refinement of eight domains in the asymmetric unit ( 1- 2 and 3 for each of four ZAG molecules) using CNS [A. T. Brunger et al., ¨ Acta Crystallogr. D 54, 905 (1998)], the four molecules were subjected to restrained NCS torsion-angle refinement using the maximum likelihood target function. Tight NCS restraints (300 kcal/mol.Å2) were applied to all regions except for flexible loops and residues involved in lattice contacts. Intermediate rounds of model building and refinement included the calculation of SIGMAA-weighted [R. J. Read, Acta Crystallogr. A 42, 140 (1986)] simulated annealing omit maps [A. Hodel, S.-H. Kim, A. T. Brunger, Acta Crystallogr. A 48, 851 ¨ (1992)]. Final rounds of rebuilding and refinement included tightly restrained individual atomic temperature factor refinement (temperature factor rms deviation for bonded main chain and side chain atoms is 5.7 and 8.8 Å2, respectively). The model consists of residues 5 through 277 (average B: 48 Å2) with nine carbohydrate residues (average B: 61 Å2) for molecule 1, residues 5 through 278 (average B: 56 Å2) with 11 carbohydrate residues (average B: 80 Å2) for molecule 2, residues 6 through 278 (average B: 57 Å2) with four carbohydrate residues (average B: 107 Å2) for molecule 3, and residues 6 through 249 and 258 through 276 (average B: 62 Å2) with five carbohydrate residues (average B: 90 Å2) for molecule 4 (Wilson B 64 Å2). Excluding regions that deviate from the NCS, the domains in the NCSrelated ZAG monomers are very similar ( 0.04 Å rms deviation for C atoms). Ramachandran plot statistics (Table 1) are as defined by G. J. Kleywegt and T. A. Jones [Structure 4, 1395 (1996)]. Extensive carbohydrate density is found at Asn239 (nine ordered carbohydrate residues in molecule 2) and to a much lesser extent at Asn89 and Asn108 in all four ZAG molecules (Fig. 1) (13). Crystal structures of glycoproteins rarely show more than three ordered carbohydrate residues at each glycosylation site [D. E. Vaughn and P. J. Bjorkman, Structure 6, 63 (1998)]. The Asn in the fourth potential N-linked glycosylation site (Asn92) does not show density corresponding to carbohydrate. The bond between Asn92 and Gly93 can be cleaved by hydroxylamine, confirming that Asn92 is not glycosylated (18). M. Takagaki et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 201, 1339 (1994); O.

Structural features that prevent ZAG from binding 2M include the following residues, which clash with
2M when it is positioned on the ZAG structure either by interacting with 3 or with 1- 2: Ile13, Thr15, Leu30, Arg40, Gln98, Tyr118, Lys122, Val234, His236, Trp245. L. M. Sanchez and P. J.

Superpositions based on C atoms in the platform strands reveal that the ZAG platform is more similar to classical class I MHC molecules than to any of the class I homologs [rms deviations for superpositions of platforms: ZAG and HLA-A2, 1.3 Å (147 C atoms); ZAG and CD1, 1.1 Å (86 C atoms); ZAG and FcRn 1.0 Å (88 C atoms); ZAG and HFE 1.0 Å (115 C atoms)].

Electrostatic calculations were done and Figs. 2A (left) and 3B were made using GRASP [A. Nicholls, R. Bharadwaj, B. Honig, Biophys. J. 64, A166 (1993)]. ZAG, CD1, HFE, and FcRn contain prolines within their 2 domain helices at a position corresponding to Val165 in classical class I MHC molecules (4). The FcRn and CD1 helices are kinked at a position near their proline residues, whereas the ZAG and HFE helices are similar to the 2 domain helices of class I molecules (11). Substitution of Val165 for proline in the mouse class I molecule H-2Dd did not interfere with binding and presentation of peptides to T cells, suggesting that no major structural rearrangements occurred [D. Plaksin, K. Polakova, M. G. Mage, D. H. Margulies, J. Immunol. 159, 4408 (1997)]. We thank G. Hathaway, P. G. Green, and K. Faull for mass spectrometric analyses.

Acoel Flatworms: Earliest Extant Bilaterian Metazoans, Not Members of Platyhelminthes
Inaki Ruiz-Trillo,1 Marta Riutort,1 D. Timothy J. Littlewood,2 ~ Elisabeth A. Herniou,2 Jaume Bagun`1* ~a
Because of their simple organization the Acoela have been considered to be either primitive bilaterians or descendants of coelomates through secondary loss of derived features. Sequence data of 18S ribosomal DNA genes from non­fast evolving species of acoels and other metazoans reveal that this group does not belong to the Platyhelminthes but represents the extant members of the earliest divergent Bilateria, an interpretation that is supported by recent studies on the embryonic cleavage pattern and nervous system of acoels. This study has implications for understanding the evolution of major body plans, and for perceptions of the Cambrian evolutionary explosion. "Since the first Metazoa were almost certainly radial animals, the Bilateria must have sprung from a radial ancestor, and there must have been an alteration from radial to bilateral symmetry. This change constitutes a most difficult gap for phylogeneticists to bridge, and various highly speculative conjectures have been made" (1, p. 5). So began Libbie Hyman's discussion on the origin of bilaterian Metazoa, and despite a century of morphological studies and a decade of intensive molecular work, the nature of the simplest bilaterian animal remains elusive (1, 2). Paleontological and molecular data indicate that most bilaterian phyla appeared and diversified during the Cambrian explosion (3, 4). Three main clades emerged--
