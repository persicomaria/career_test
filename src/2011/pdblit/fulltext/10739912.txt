Structure determination of bacteriophage PP7 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa: from poor data to a good map
The structure of bacteriophage PP7 from Pseudomomas Ê aeruginosa was determined to 3.7 A resolution. Triclinic crystals of three forms were obtained, diffracting to between Ê 4.5 and 3.4 A resolution. The quality of the crystals was exceptionally poor, leading to problems in the evaluation of the recorded images and to a ®nal data set which would appear to be useless with standard criteria for protein crystals. In all crystal forms, the unit cell contains two icosahedral particles, providing 120-fold non-crystallographic symmetry. For two of the crystal forms, the particle orientations were calculated using the self-rotation function. The two particles in the asymmetric unit had very similar but distinct orientations. The position of the second particle was found using the Patterson Ê function. Initial phases to 15 A resolution were calculated using the related phage MS2 as a model. Real-space averaging Ê was performed and phases were extended from 15 A resolution to the limit of the data. The map was improved signi®cantly by using only the `high' resolution data in the Ê resolution range 7±3.7 A, allowing the positions of most side Ê chains to be determined. The better quality of the 7±3.7 A resolution map is presumably a consequence of the presence of satellite crystals. The position of the second particle was improved using the correlation coef®cient in the averaging process to monitor the re®nement by moving the particle around in small steps.

1. Introduction
Methods for the structure determination of viruses are well established. Initial phases to relatively low resolution can be extended to a resolution where an atomic model can be built in the electron-density map (Hogle et al., 1985; Rossmann et al., 1985). The initial phases are obtained from isomorphous replacement or molecular replacement. For molecular replacement, models of distantly related viruses (Hogle et al., 1986; Luo et al., 1987; Acharya et al., 1989; Golmohammadi et al., 1996; Chandrasekar & Johnson, 1998; Tate et al., 1999) or even Ê still simpler models (Valegard et al., 1991; McKenna et al., 1992; Speir et al., 1995; Simpson et al., 1998; Munshi et al., 1998; Dokland et al., 1998) have been used. The phase extension requires accurate parameters for the orientation and position of particles. P. aeruginosa phage PP7 is related to small RNA coliphages Ê such as MS2 (Valegard et al., 1990; Golmohammadi et al., 1993), GA (Tars et al., 1997) and Q (Golmohammadi et al., 1996). It has a T = 3 shell composed of 180 chemically identical monomers, each 127 amino-acid residues in length. Additionally, there is a single copy of the A protein per virion. The positive-stranded RNA genome (3588 nucleotides) also codes for the replicase and lysis proteins (Olsthoorn et al., 1995). The

presence of a further protein, called p25, has been reported (Olsthoorn et al., 1995), but its origin is not clear. The N-terminal amino-acid sequence of p25 is identical to that of coat protein. The molecular weight of p25 is incompatible with any read-through or ribosome frameshift model. The current explanation is that p25 might be a covalently associated dimer of the normal coat protein. Here, we report the crystallization and structure determiÊ nation of phage PP7 to 3.7 A resolution using the molecularreplacement method. In this case, no model with signi®cant

sequence similarities is available, but PP7 was assumed to be similar to MS2 and other coliphages because of the similarity in the genome organization. The special problems encountered in this case were the poor quality of the crystals and the large number of parameters to be determined in the P1 cell containing two particles with very similar orientations.

2. Methods
P. aeruginosa strain PA01 cells were grown in a rich 2TY medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract and 0.5% NaCl) to a density of 6 Â 108 bacteria mlÀ1, infected with phage PP7 at a multiplicity of 10 and incubated for another 4 h. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation, the phage was precipitated with dry ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation, centrifuged, dissolved in 20 mM Tris±HCl buffer pH 8.0 and applied to a Sepharose CL-4B gel-®ltration column. Peak fractions were collected, precipitated and applied two more times to the same column. Fractions from the ®nal separation were examined on polyacrylamide±SDS gel, precipitated with 10% PEG 6000 and dissolved in 20 mM Tris±HCl buffer pH 8.0. Besides the major PP7 coat-protein band, thin bands corresponding to the molecular weight of the A protein and the p25 protein were observed on the SDS gel. Depending on the individual phage preparations, the amount of p25 varied from 1 to 10% of the total capsid material as crudely estimated from the band intensity on the gel. When the concentration of p25 was high (5±10%), the protein solution was coloured red as described by Olsthoorn et al. (1995). Useful crystals were never obtained from red preparations. This might be because of an enhanced asymmetry of particles caused by the presence of several p25 protein molecules on the capsid surface. The phage particle also contains a single copy of the A protein, which might cause additional asymmetry of the capsid. Crystals were obtained under two different conditions using the hanging-drop technique. In both cases, 5 ml of phage solution (7 mg mlÀ1) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution. Crystal type A (irregular shape) was obtained using 0.2 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5 and 30%(v/v) 2-methyl-4,4-pentanediol at room temperature. Crystal types B and C (rhombic shape) were obtained using 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer pH 5.6 and 3.0 M 1,6-hexanediol at 310 K. Crystal form A grew to a maximum dimension of 1 mm in about two weeks. Crystal forms B and C grew to a size of 1.8 mm in about six weeks. Data was collected on a MAR 30 image plate and ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detectors at station 9.6 of the SERC

Synchrotron Radiation Source in Daresbury, England and on a MAR 30 image plate at the MAX-Lab synchrotron facility in Lund, Sweden. Data was processed and scaled with the HKL package (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996). Data for crystal form A were merged using the HKL package with no rejections. Data for crystal forms B and C were merged using the CCP4 program AGROVATA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). For crystal form B, less than 0.3% of the measurements (0.7% of the scaling re¯ections) were rejected using the default rejection criteria in AGROVATA. No ' cutoff was used. In this data set, the fractional bias was estimated to be about 8%. In the ®nal merging using AGROVATA, partial re¯ections recorded on adjacent images were added to the equivalent full re¯ections. Of the remaining partial re¯ections not recorded on adjacent images, those that were more than 50% recorded on one image were used and

was somewhat less sensitive to radiation and the maximal Ê resolution was 3.4 A. However, higher resolution data Ê (beyond 4.5 A) was weak. From three to ten images were obtained from each position of the crystal. The hI/'(I)i ratio from DENZO was used to determine the individual resolution limit for each image. The maximal resolution with hI/'(I)i > 2 was used. The quality of the crystals within a single crystal form was similar, but some were small and could be used only to low resolution. The diffraction pattern at low resolution was very complex, which made the autoindexing unusually dif®cult. As shown in Fig. 1, many strong spots at low resolution were not part of the predicted pattern. One explanation might be that the crystals were an aggregate containing one major crystal and several smaller satellite crystals. However, some crystals seemed regular, but still showed the same complex diffraction pattern. We were not able to ®nd a procedure for autoindexing that would work for most crystals. For each crystal, different combinations of high- and low-resolution limits, spot size and number of spots were tested until the correct indexing was found. We never managed to index some crystals. The correctness of the solution could be identi®ed by the similarities of the unit-cell parameters to the established parameters for that crystal type and by the relative similarity of the predicted and observed spot positions at high resolution. The identi®cation of a correct indexing was further complicated by the fact that the similar crystal forms B and C were obtained using the same conditions and did not differ in morphology. In all three crystal forms, the space group is P1 with angles close to 90 (Table 1). Since the unit-cell angles are close to 90 , the autoindexing did not always choose a unit cell with the same axis direction. Therefore, the re¯ections from each crystal had to be scaled to a small data set of consistently indexed re¯ections to ensure the correct choice of the axis directions. The four possible ways of indexing were tried by applying a re-indexing matrix in SCALEPACK. The 12 values were always much lower for the correct indexing. After scaling and post-re®nement, all images were reprocessed using the re®ned unit-cell dimensions (which were ®xed) and the properly transformed mis-setting angles. For some images, the unit-cell parameters obtained after autoindexing and re®nement in DENZO differed signi®cantly from the parameters from post-re®nement. Reprocessing of these images often required a stepwise change in the unit-cell parameters combined with re®nement until the ®nal parameters were reached. Reprocessing with the correct cell gave more re¯ections and better scaling statistics. The crystal mosaicity was determined from the pro®les of the average intensities of partial re¯ections in DENZO. Values between 0.2 and 0.4 were obtained. In some cases, the mosaicity appeared to be still higher, but scaling of data from images with no full re¯ections did not work well. No post-re®nement was performed in the ®nal scaling. The unit-cell parameters were redetermined using the reprocessed data. The small amount of data available did not allow a separate re®nement of the unit-cell parameters for each crystal.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Data collection and processing

In total, about 20 crystals of form A and about 20 crystals of form B were used. An oscillation angle of 0.4 or 0.5 was used. Crystal form A appeared to be sensitive to radiation damage. Ê The maximal resolution (4.3 A) could be recorded only on the ®rst image. Crystal form B (not available from the beginning)

Statistics from the scaling of crystal forms A and B are shown in Table 2. The multiplicity was 1.3 and 1.4, respectively, for these two data sets. Of the measurements used, 19 and 24% were full re¯ections for crystal forms A and B, respecÊ tively. R factors for the higher resolution data (below 6 A) were very high. The resulting data was still useful, as demonstrated by the rotation function below. Data for crystal form C was too incomplete to be used for further calculations.

parameters: six parameters for the orientation of both particles and three for the relative position of the particle centres. Re¯ections of type h + k + l = odd were systematically weak Ê at low resolution (to 7 A) for both crystal forms A and B. This indicated that the cell is pseudo-I-centred and that both particles in the asymmetric unit must have similar orientations.
3.3. The rotation function

Although the space group is the same and the differences in unit-cell parameters are moderate, the particle orientations The unit-cell parameters together with the typical diameter for the two crystal forms are completely different (Figs. 2a and Ê of small RNA phages (280±300 A) suggested that there are 2b). Since there are two particles in the asymmetric unit in two particles in the asymmetric unit. Since in P1 one can both cells, it was surprising that both of them seemed to have choose the origin freely (the origin was chosen to be at the the same orientation, even if similar orientations were centre of one particle), there remain nine undetermined predicted from the systematically weak re¯ections of type h + k + l = odd. However, when using only high-resolution Ê Ê re¯ections (5.5±4.3 A for form A and 4.5±3.4 A for form B) Ê ), the peaks split clearly and a larger integration radius (200 A (Figs. 2c±2g). The importance of using thin resolution shells at the highest possible resolution to resolve similar particle orientations has been demonstrated previously (Muckelbauer et al., 1995). The split peaks also show two extra peaks. The same appearance of this pattern of rotation-function peaks from particles with similar orientations has been observed previously (Oliveira et al., 1993; Muckelbauer et al., 1995; Wikoff et al., 1999) and has been explained as packing peaks (Muckelbauer et al., 1995). Packing peaks can be generated by the symmetry of the packing of particles in the crystal Ê (Akervall et al., 1971), but it is not obvious what features of the packing would generate the observed pattern. A locked self-rotation function (Rossmann et al., 1972) was calculated on a coarse grid (5 ) covering all three polar angles 9, 2, for 0±180 . The highest peak was selected for a ®ner search (in 0.1 steps). The ®nal locked rotation function showed clearly two closely located but separate peaks with an overlap peak in the middle (Figs. 3a and 3b). When a smaller integration Ê radius (50 A) was chosen, only one peak was found at a position between the two true peaks. The ®nal results showed that particle orientations relative to the standard icosahedral orientation are 91b = 140.4, 21b = 70.4, 1b = 95.3, 92b = 140.2, 22b = 69.5 and 2b = 96.3 for crystal form B, and 91a = 149.0, 21a = 69.6, 1a = 149.6, 92a = 149.8, Figure 3 22a = 70.0 and 2a = 149.7 for crystal Detailed searches of the locked rotation functions of crystal forms A and B.

In both cases, there are two peaks P1 and P2 corresponding to the self-rotation function in most cases orientations of the two particles. Between them there is an overlap peak, which can be regarded as an matched exactly with the peaks in average of both true peaks. When a smaller radius of integration or lower resolution is used, only this the self-rotation searches. In Fig. 4, average peak is seen.

the orientations of both particles for crystal form B are shown, as determined by the locked self-rotation function.
3.4. The Patterson function

In order to locate the position of the second particle, a native Patterson function was calculated. If the particles have similar orientation, a peak corresponding to the vector between them is expected. When using re¯ections in the Ê resolution range 20±8 A, a peak appeared at x = 154.9, Ê y = 166.9, z = 189.6 A for crystal form B and at x = 141.7, Ê y = 162.4, z = 182.5 A for crystal form A (orthogonal coordinates). In both cases, these peaks were at a level of 60% of the origin peak. The positions of the peaks correspond exactly to (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) in crystal coordinates. This position was expected from the unit-cell parameters and particle diameter. Since the peak is found at the inversion center of the Patterson function (space group P1), a small deviation from this position is expected to be masked by overlap with the symmetry-related peak. The Patterson function was calculated using several Ê resolution limits (20±9, 20±3.4, 8.0±3.4 and 12.0±6.0 A) to test whether the peak had any tendency to move away from the Ê inversion center. At 8.0±3.4 A resolution, no signi®cant peak except the origin peak was observed. This is most likely to be caused by the slightly different orientation of the two particles. When other resolution limits were used, the highest peak was always exactly at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), but the height of the peak in relation to the origin peak was reduced when higher resolution data was used.
3.5. Phasing

of which had been determined previously Ê (Valegard et al., 1990). The MS2 coat protein has a sequence identity of about 10% to PP7, well below the level of identity required for Completeness molecular replacement at high resolution. 54.8 Comparisons of the conformation of phage 60.0 coat proteins suggest that the expected degree 63.7 63.4 of structural similarity between the PP7 and 61.7 MS2 coat proteins would correspond to an 58.9 Ê r.m.s. deviation of at best 2.5 A for C atoms 57.4 56.1 (Tars et al., 1997). 54.0 From the unit-cell parameters, it was esti51.9 mated that phage PP7 has a slightly larger 46.5 39.2 Ê diameter (about 7±10 A) than MS2. A poly28.7 alanine model of MS2 coordinates was made 19.0 and the three subunits were moved individu11.3 6.8 Ê ally by 7 A in a direction radially away from 5.7 the particle centre. The 120 non-crystal4.0 lographic symmetry operators were generated 1.7 30.0 using the icosahedral geometry and the orientation and position of both particles in the asymmetric unit. The initial phases were È calculated in X-PLOR (Brunger, 1990). The initial R factor between the model and the observed ampliÊ tudes was 0.54 for re¯ections in the resolution range 20±10 A. A mask was created covering all model atoms with a sphere Ê Ê of 12 A radius. A 2Fo À Fc map was calculated to 15 A resolution using model phases and observed amplitudes. Realspace averaging was performed using the RAVE package (Kleywegt & Jones, 1993, 1994). In the presence of non-

crystallographic symmetry, successful phase determination can also be performed with incomplete data. In this case, the data was about 30% complete and at the resolution edge used it was about 5% complete. Similar levels of completeness have been used in other virus structure determinations (Chandrasekar & Johnson, 1998; Tate et al., 1999). Phase extension Ê from 15 to 8 A was performed in several steps, each step corresponding to extension by one reciprocal-space index in the l direction. For each extension cycle, four cycles of averaging were performed. Missing re¯ections were not replaced by calculated values during the phase extension. The map was examined at this stage and showed clearly the expected Ê density of PP7, but shifted by about 3 A outwards compared with the model. The model subunits were manually ®tted as rigid bodies into the density where the -sheet and helices appeared clearly. Phases from the new model were calculated in X-PLOR. The R factor remained at 0.54. The averaging and phase extension was repeated, this time in the resolution range Ê Ê 15±3.7 A (15±4.4 A for crystal form A). Inspection of the map showed that some parts of the electron density (particularly covering the FG loop of the B subunit) might be outside the mask. The mask was then manually corrected in the program Ê O (Jones et al., 1990) and ten further averaging cycles at 3.7 A resolution were run using the new mask. For both crystal forms, the map looked very similar, in spite of the resolution for crystal form B being higher. The data in Ê the resolution range 4.5±3.4 A is limited and of poor quality as judged by the scaling statistics. This data still contains some useful information, since the rotation function for crystal form Ê B and data in the resolution range 4.5±3.4 A gave clear peaks corresponding to the icosahedral symmetry elements. The data at low resolution might contain severe errors, as suggested by the complex diffraction pattern at low resolution, the serious problems with data processing and the poor scaling statistics. To test if the `high' resolution data could be useful, another map was calculated and averaged for ten cycles, using Ê only data in the resolution range 7±3.7 A. This gave a significant improvement in the map quality (Fig. 5) in all parts of the model except at the more disordered C-terminus, where the original map was slightly better. The new map obtained from crystal form B was much better than that from crystal form A. The map from crystal form A did not represent any features which were lacking in the crystal form B map. Therefore, multi-crystal averaging was not attempted. Subsequently, only the map of crystal form B was used for model building and re®nement. Since the Patterson function was calculated using the lowresolution data only, the centre of the second particle might not be de®ned with suf®cient precision. An improved position was determined by shifting the particle centre and monitoring the correlation coef®cient in averaging. A program was written which automatically performed this operation. The algorithm for this is shown in Fig. 6. Four cycles of averaging Ê were run for each new position. The initial step size was 2 A. Since no improvement was achieved (correlation coef®cient was worse than 0.4 in most cases), further step sizes of 1, 0.5, Ê 0.25 and 0.125 A were tried. The best correlation coef®cient was obtained with a minor shift of the second particle by Ê Áx = À0.25 A. This improved the correlation coef®cient for Ê re¯ections between 7 and 3.7 A resolution from 0.667 to 0.671. In all other calculated positions, the correlation coef®cient was worse than 0.667. The correlation coef®cient dropped to less than 0.40 if the Ê particle was moved for more than 2 A in any direction and to less than 0.60 if moved for more Ê than 1 A. According to our calculations, the particle centre is de®ned within an error of less Ê than 0.2 A.

The amino-acid sequence of PP7 could easily be ®tted to the side-chain density in the map. Owing to the low resolution, however, several side chains were not visible, especially in the loop regions. The PP7 model was built manually in program O using the modi®ed MS2 model as a starting point. The structure was re®ned with the conjugategradient method, followed by simulated annealing in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). Strict icosahedral constraints and positional re®nement were used. The R factor fell from 0.49 (after map calculation, using the built PP7 model) to 0.41 after conjugate gradient and 0.35 after simulated annealing. The model was inspected and outliers

The general algorithm for re®nement of the second particle centre. The particle was moved around in all three directions, which means that for each grid point (corresponding to the current best particle position) all 26 neighbouring grid points were checked. For each new particle position, four cycles of averaging were performed. An average correlation Ê coef®cient for higher resolution bins (7±3.7 A) was calculated. If the central grid point gave the best results, the step size was reduced by a factor of two and the whole process was repeated.

Figure 6

in the Ramachandran plot were corrected whenever possible. This was followed by one further conjugate-gradient re®nement. The Ramachandran plot for the ®nal model had 5% outliers as de®ned by Kleywegt & Jones (1996). The present R factor is 0.34 for all re¯ections.
