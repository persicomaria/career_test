Abstract The major virulence determinant in clostridial myonecrosis caused by Clostridium perfringens is a phospholipase C (PLC), the a-toxin. Previously, mice have been protected against challenge with heterologous a-toxin or Clostridium perfringens spores by immunisation with the C-domain (known as Cpa247≠370 or a-toxoid) of the a-toxin. In this study, we have determined the ability of the a-toxoid to protect against the lethal effects of a divergent C. perfringens a-toxin and against the PLCs of C. absonum or C. bifermentans, species which have been isolated from cases of clostridial myonecrosis. Protection against the C. perfringens a-toxin variant, the C. absonum a-toxin or the C. bifermentans PLC was elicited by immunisation with the a-toxoid in vivo.

1. Introduction Clostridial myonecrosis, or gas gangrene, is an acute disease which results from the germination of clostridial spores in soft tissues, with the production of extracellular toxins [1], characterised by the rapid swelling of the affected area, fever and necrosis of soft tissue [2]. Clostridium perfringens is the main aetiological agent of clostridial myonecrosis although other clostridia, including Clostridium absonum, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium sporogenes, Clostridium histolyticum and Clostridium fallax have also been isolated from necrotic tissue [3≠6]. The major C. perfringens virulence determinant which contributes to clostridial myonecrosis is a phospholipase C (PLC), the a-toxin [7,8], which has lethal, haemolytic, phosphatidyl choline PLC and sphingomyelinase activities.

catalytic site is located in the N-terminal domain of the protein, whereas the C-terminal domain confers haemolytic and lethal activities upon the whole toxin [9≠13]. The C. perfringens a-toxin is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of some enterotoxaemias in domesticated livestock such as intensively reared fowl [14] and calves [15]. One avian isolate of C. perfringens has been found that produces a highly divergent form of a-toxin (SWCP) [16]. C. absonum and C. bifermentans also produce PLCs, with the C. absonum a-toxin (Caa) and C. bifermentans (Cbp) PLCs displaying 60% [17] and 50% [18] identity, respectively, with the C. perfringens a-toxin at the amino acid level. The isolated C-terminal domain of the C. perfringens a-toxin (known as Cpa247≠370 or the a-toxoid) is a potent immunogen [19] that protects mice against a spore [20] or a-toxin challenge [21,22] from a homologous C. perfringens strain. The Cpa247≠370 vaccine has been previously described and is currently being developed and we have investigated how broad ranging the protection offered by such a vaccine may be. The aim of this study was to determine whether Cpa247≠370 could protect against a

divergent form of the C. perfringens a-toxin or against heterologous PLCs such as the C. absonum a-toxin or C. bifermentans PLC. 2. Results 2.1. Cross-reactivity of antisera to Cpa247≠370 with heterologous clostridial PLCs The C. perfringens NCTC 8237 a-toxin (Cpa), C. perfringens SWAN a-toxin (SWCP), C. absonum a-toxin (Caa) and the C. bifermentans PLC (Cbp) were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, providing PLCS that were 59%, 69%, 78% or 88% pure, respectively. To generate antibody to Cpa247≠370, mice were immunised with purified recombinant GST-Cpa247≠370 fusion protein [21] in Freunds incomplete adjuvant to induce anti-Cpa247≠370 IgG titres of 1:12,800≠1:505,600 (mean º 1:145,000). Subsequently, the cross-reactivity of anti-GST-Cpa247≠370 sera with the various PLCs was determined using an indirect ELISA. The end-point IgG titres to Cpa247≠370 or the full-length Cpa were 1:64,000 (Table 1). In comparison, the end-point titres to SWCP or Caa were 1:6400 and 1:800, respectively. The crossreactivity of GST-Cpa247≠370 antisera to Cbp was below the limit of detection of the ELISA (o1:100). 2.2. Protection afforded by Cpa247≠370 against heterologous PLC challenge To determine the level of protection afforded by immunisation with GST-Cpa247≠370, immunised or nonimmunised Balb/C mice were challenged with Cpa, SWCP, Caa or Cbp PLCs. Following challenge with 1 mg of Cpa, nai® ve mice had a mean time to death of 4 h (Table 2). In comparison, GST-Cpa247≠370-immunised mice were fully protected against this challenge and there were no signs of intoxication. SWCP was less toxic than Cpa with survival of 2 of 6 nai® ve mice which had been dosed with 1 mg of the protein (Table 2). The nai® ve mice that did succumb to SWCP were culled at a humane end point of 30 h postchallenge. In comparison to nai® ve mice, 5/6 (83%) of GSTTable 1 Cross-reactivity of antisera to GST-Cpa247¿370 with heterologous clostridial PLCs Protein C. perfringens NCTC 8237 a-toxin (Cpa) C. perfringens SWAN a-toxin (SWCP) C. absonum ATCC 27555 a-toxin (Caa) C. bifermentans ATCC 638 PLC (Cbp) GST-Cpa247≠370 End-point titre 1:64,000 1:6400 1:800 ND 1:64,000

Cpa247≠370-immunised mice were protected from the lethal effects of SWCP challenge. Nai® ve mice challenged with 1 mg of Caa displayed acute toxicity (severe piloerection) by 8 h post-challenge and were culled at this time. In comparison, GST-Cpa247≠370immunised mice were all protected against the lethal effects of challenge with Caa (Table 2) although mild piloerection was observed at 24 post-challenge. Cbp was markedly less toxic in mice than Cpa, SWCP or Caa, with 100% of nai® ve mice surviving a 1 mg challenge dose, although a higher challenge dose of 25 mg was lethal in 5/6 (83%) nai® ve mice. Immunisation with GST-Cpa247≠370 conferred complete protection against challenge with 25 mg Cbp (Table 2). Severe piloerection was observed in immunised mice within 1 h of challenge with Cbp, although this diminished and by 36 h there were no outward signs of toxicity in the surviving mice. 2.3. In vitro neutralisation of PLC cytotoxicity by antiGST-Cpa247≠370 immune serum The toxicity of clostridial PLCs towards cultured eukaryotic cells has previously been reported [17]. In this study, the concentration of toxin required to result in approximately 95% death (CT95) of bovine lung endothelial cell monolayers (BPAEC) was determined for each of the PLCs. For Cpa, SWCP or Caa, the CT95 was 0.5, 5 or 5 mg mL¿1, respectively. The CT95 for Cbp could not be determined as it was found to be above the highest concentration (100 mg ml¿1) tested. Under the experimental conditions used, antisera to GST-Cpa247≠370 protected bovine lung endothelial cells from the cytotoxicity of Cpa only, at dilutions of less than 1/100, with complete neutralisation at dilutions of less than 1/20 (data not shown). GST-Cpa247≠370 antiserum was unable to neutralise the activity of the SWCP or Caa PLCs. 3. Discussion and conclusions Previous studies have shown that immunisation of mice with recombinant Cpa247¿370 provides protection against the lethal effects of the C. perfringens Cpa [21,22] or from experimental gas gangrene [20]. Protection against a bovine enteric strain of C. perfringens, CER89L43, with 98% sequence identity to Cpa, has previously been reported following immunisation with Cpa247≠370 [23]. However, the a-toxin cloned from an avian C. perfringens isolate, SWCP, is the most highly divergent form of a-toxin reported to date with only 83% amino acid sequence identity and altered substrate specificity compared to Cpa [16]. The C. absonum a-toxin and C. bifermentans PLC show only 60% [17] and 50% [18] amino acid sequence identity to Cpa, respectively. The C-domains of SWCP, Caa and Cbp show 83%, 50% and 42% amino acid sequence identity to that of Cpa (NCTC 8237), respectively. In spite of the diversities of the amino acid sequences and substrate specificities of these proteins [16≠18], we have shown that

To generate antibody to Cpa247≠370, mice were immunised with recombinant purified GST-Cpa247≠370 fusion protein in Freunds incomplete adjuvant with the serum samples taken 2 weeks following the immunisations. The cross-reactivity of sera from GST-Cpa247≠370-immunised mice with the various PLCs was measured by ELISA.

Group contained only 5 mice; ++Data for 1 mouse only; N/A º not applicable. Groups of six female Balb/c mice were immunised with 3 doses of 10 mg of GST-Cpa247≠370 adjuvanted with Freund's incomplete at 2-week intervals. Mice were challenged 3 weeks after the final immunisation by the i.p. route with 1 or 25 mg of recombinant C. perfringens NCTC 8237 a-toxin (Cpa), C. perfringens Swan a-toxin (SWCP), C. absonum ATCC 27555 a-toxin (Caa) or C. bifermentans ATCC 638 PLC (Cbp).

immunisation with GST-Cpa247¿370 provides protection against the lethal effects of SWCP, Caa or Cbp in a murine model. Antisera raised against GST-Cpa247≠370 crossreacted with Cpa, SWCP or Caa in vitro and the degree of amino acid sequence diversity at which antigenic crossreactivity declines is considered to be lower than 50%. Overall, our findings indicate that there are antibodyneutralising epitopes shared by Cpa, SWCP, Caa and Cbp. Although immunisation with GST-Cpa247≠370 protected against Cpa, SWCP, Caa or Cbp, only Cpa was neutralised in an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. This might indicate that the in vivo protection against SWCP, Caa or Cbp toxins requires only low molar ratios of neutralising antibody whereas greater molar ratios of antibody to toxin may be needed to neutralise the cytotoxicity of the PLCs in vitro. Monoclonal antibodies have been shown previously to neutralise the PLC and lethal activities of Cpa [17] and the availability of neutralising antibodies appears to be important in providing protection against clostridial PLCs. It has been reported that an a-toxin variant, devoid of PLC, haemolytic or lethal activities was capable of eliciting protection in a murine model against a wild-type a-toxin challenge [24]. Antiserum against the a-toxin variant reduced PLC and haemolytic activity in in vitro assays and led to an increased time to death when passively transferred to nai® ve mice. It is possible that antibodies in the polyclonal antiserum generated in this study by immunisation with GST-Cpa247≠370 are able to prevent the various toxins from interacting with host cells by binding to the membrane interface region (defined as amino acids 268≠275, 293≠301, 329≠337 and 364 [12]) and inhibiting enzymatic functions in the N-terminus through stearic hindrance or by opsonisation. The results reported here show that protection against divergent C. perfringens a-toxins and PLC toxins from C. absonum and C. bifermentans is afforded by immunisa-

tion with the C-domain (Cpa247≠370) cloned from a C. perfringens isolate. This indicates that a vaccine composed of the C-domain of a-toxin (a-toxoid) could prove useful as a tool for protecting against clostridial myonecrosis and diseases where the C. perfringens a-toxin is a major virulence determinant. The finding that the C. perfringens a-toxoid was capable of protecting against a lethal challenge from the C. absonum a-toxin or C. bifermentans PLC suggests that diseases in which these toxins are key virulence determinants may also be prevented by immunisation with the a-toxoid. Therefore, the a-toxoid (Cpa247≠370) vaccine, which has been reported previously to offer protection against the homologous C. perfringens a-toxin, has been shown in this study to elicit a protective immune response against a broad range of clostridial PLC toxins and may prove useful as a vaccine against a number of diseases caused by clostridia where PLCs are required for the disease to occur.

4. Materials and methods 4.1. Expression and purification of recombinant proteins C. perfringens NCTC 8237 a-toxin (Cpa), C. perfringens SWAN a-toxin (SWCP), C. absonum ATCC 27555 a-toxin (Caa) or C. bifermentans ATCC 638 PLC (Cbp) were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously [16≠18]. GST-Cpa247¿370 was expressed from the pGEX3X13 vector in E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysS cells (Stratagene Europe) as described previously [21]. The recombinant GST-Cpa247¿370 was purified from cell lysates by passing through a GSTrap Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in elution buffer (50 mM Tris-base, 10 mM reduced glutathione pH 8.0). Salt was removed from purified GST-Cpa247≠370 using a PD10 desalting

column (GE Healthcare) and the protein was eluted in PBS (Gibco BRL). Purified protein was assayed using the bicinchonic acid (BCA) protein method (Pierce & Warriner Ltd., Chester, UK). The purity of recombinant proteins was measured after Coomassie Blue R250 staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the PhastSystem (GE Healthcare, Bucks, UK) and using scanning densitometry performed with GeneGenius (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). 4.2. Immunisations and PLC challenge Groups of 6 female Balb/c mice (Charles River Ltd, Margate, UK), aged 6≠8 weeks, were immunised by the intra-peritoneal (i.p.) route with 3 doses of GST-Cpa247¿370 (10 mg) in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Brenntag Biosector AS, Denmark) at 2-week intervals. Blood samples were taken from the tail veins of immunised mice 2 weeks after the final immunisation and the serum was separated. Subsequently, mice were challenged by the i.p. route 21 days after the final immunisation with 1 or 25 mg of purified recombinant Cpa, SWCP, Caa or Cbp. Groups of 6 nai® ve mice were included for each challenge dose. Mice were monitored for symptoms of toxicity (pinching or piloerection) twice daily for 6 days, then once daily for a further 4 days. All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act, 1986. 4.3. Enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay The reactivity of antisera to GST-Cpa247≠370 towards clostridial PLCs was measured using a standard indirect ELISA. Briefly, 96-well microtitre plates (ThermoLab systems) were coated with 10 mg recombinant GSTCpa247≠370, Cpa, SWCP, Caa or Cbp, as required. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in PBS. Two-fold dilutions of test samples were added to the plates in duplicate. Following a 2 h incubation at 37 1C, plates were washed with 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS and horseradish peroxidase-labelled rabbit ≠antimouse IgG (Sigma, UK) was added to the wells. Following a further 2 h incubation at 37 1C, plates were washed and the substrate, 2,20 -azino-di 3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS), was added. Twenty minutes after addition of the substrate the OD414nm of the plates was measured. The end-point dilution that gave a reading of 0.1 U above background (nai® ve mouse serum) was designated as the end-point titre. The end-point titre of anti-Cpa247≠370 was calculated by subtraction of the anti-GST end-point titre from that of the GST-Cpa247≠370 and is given as a reciprocal of the dilution. 4.4. Cytotoxicity assay An assay for evaluating the cytotoxicity of clostridial PLCs towards bovine lung endothelial cells (BPAECs) (European Collection of Cells Cultures Ref No. 86123101)

has previously been established [17]. This cytotoxicity assay was used here to elucidate the concentration at which Caa, Cbp or Cpa killed 95% (CT95) of the cells present in the 96well plates. Briefly, in order to establish the in vitro toxin neutralising activity of the antisera raised against Cpa247≠370, the sera was first preincubated with the toxins for 1 h at 37 1C, then the treated toxin was administered to hexuplicate wells per condition examined. Confluent cell monolayers were exposed to the toxin for 24 h, and, at 23 h, the cells also received 4,5-dimethylthiozolzyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; 20 mL per well at 2 mg/mL in FCS-free media). The plates were then treated as per the cytotoxicity assay [10] and the OD540 nm was measured.
