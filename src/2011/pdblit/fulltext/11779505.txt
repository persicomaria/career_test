Crystal structure of a transcriptionally active Smad4 fragment
Bin Qin, Suvana SW Lam and Kai Lin*
Background: Smad4 functions as a common mediator of transforming growth factor  (TGF-) signaling by forming complexes with the phosphorylated state of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins that act in specific signaling pathways to activate transcription. SMAD proteins comprise two domains, the MH1 and MH2 domain, separated by a linker region. The transcriptional activity and synergistic effect of Smad4 require a stretch of proline-rich sequence, the SMAD-activation domain (SAD), located N-terminal of the MH2 domain. To understand how the SAD contributes to Smad4 function, the crystal structure of a fragment including the SAD and MH2 domain (S4AF) was determined. Results: The structure of the S4AF trimer reveals novel features important for Smad4 function. A Smad4-specific sequence insertion within the MH2 domain interacts with the C-terminal tail to form a structural extension from the core. This extension (the TOWER) contains a solvent-accessible glutamine-rich helix. The SAD reinforces the TOWER and the structural core through interactions; two residues involved in these interactions are targets of tumorigenic mutation. The solvent-accessible proline residues of the SAD are located on the same face as the glutamine-rich helix of the TOWER, forming a potential transcription activation surface. A tandem sulfate-ion-binding site was identified within the subunit interface, which may interact with the phosphorylated C-terminal sequence of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins. Conclusions: The structure suggests that the SAD provides transcriptional capability by reinforcing the structural core and coordinating with the TOWER to present the proline-rich and glutamine-rich surfaces for interaction with transcription partners. The sulfate-ion-binding sites are potential `receptors' for the phosphorylated sequence of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins in forming a heteromeric complex. The structure thus provides a new model that can be tested using biochemical and cellular approaches.

Introduction
Members of the transforming growth factor- (TGF-) family of cytokines, such as TGF-s, activins and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), have important roles in early embryonic patterning and physiological regulation in vertebrates and invertebrates [1­3]. Cloning and characterization of the receptors for the TGF- family of ligands reveals that these cytokines signal through two types of interacting transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors [4]. Ligand binding induces and stabilizes association between type I and type II receptors, which triggers phosphorylation and activation of the intracellular kinase domain of the type I receptor by the constitutive intracellular kinase domain of the type II receptor [5]. After receptor kinase activation, the signals of the TGF- family of ligands are regulated by a set of evolutionarily conserved proteins known as SMAD proteins. Eight SMAD proteins have been characterized in vertebrates [6­8]. The current model suggests that Smad4, also known as DPC4 (deleted in pancreatic carcinoma

locus 4), has a central role in signal distribution by associating as hetero-oligomers with pathway-restricted SMAD proteins, Smad1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 [9­11]. Unlike Smad4, pathway-restricted SMAD proteins function in specific signaling pathways. Smad1, 5 and 8 mediate the signals of BMPs, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 mediate the signals of activins and TGF-s [10,12­14]. Upon ligand stimulation, pathway-restricted SMAD proteins are phosphorylated at the conserved C-terminal tail sequence, SS*XS* (where * denotes a site of phosphorylation), by the type I receptor kinase [15,16]. The phosphorylated states of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and are translocated into the nucleus. In the nucleus, the heteromeric complexes function as gene-specific transcription activators by binding to promoters and interacting with transcriptional coactivators. Smad6 and Smad7 are inhibitory SMAD proteins that inhibit TGF- signaling by interfering with either receptor-mediated phosphorylation or hetero-oligomerization between Smad4 and pathway-restricted SMAD proteins [17­20].

SMAD proteins share a common domain configuration consisting of the highly conserved N-terminal domain (MH1 domain) and C-terminal domain (MH2 domain) separated by a variable proline-rich linker region (L domain). For pathway-restricted SMAD proteins and Smad4, the MH2 domain has a role in transcription activation [11,14,21], whereas the MH1 domain has a role in DNA binding [22,23]. The transcription activity of the Smad4 MH2 domain requires a stretch of proline-rich sequence from the L domain. When fused to a heterologous GAL4 DNAbinding domain, Smad4(266­552) displays constitutive transcription activity whereas Smad4(322­552) is inactive [9,14,24]. Further mapping of the region defined residues 274­322 as the Smad4 activation domain (SAD), which is indispensable for transcription activation and signaling synergism [11,24]. Nevertheless, the structural basis as to how SAD contributes to transcription activation and signaling synergism remains unknown. The TGF- family of ligands induce growth arrest by regulating the expression level of cell-cycle components [25,26]. Mutations that lead to loss of TGF- signaling function are often associated with cancers [27]. Smad4 is mutated in a significant proportion of pancreatic [28] and colorectal tumors [29,30] and less frequently in breast [31], ovarian [31], head and neck [32], prostatic [30], esophageal and gastric cancers [33]. Mutations of Smad2 have also been found to be associated with colon cancers [34]. The tumorigenic mutations are clustered within the MH2 domain, which is consistent with the effector function of this domain in signaling. The crystal structure of the Smad4 MH2 domain (residues 319­552) suggests that the functional unit of SMAD proteins is trimeric. The MH2 domain forms a crystallographic trimer through a conserved protein­protein interface to which the majority of the tumor-derived missense mutations map [35]. Other tumor-derived missense mutations map to the highly conserved L3 loop (residues 506­522). Mutation of the L3 loop disrupts heteromeric interaction between Smad4 and pathway-restricted SMAD proteins, leading to the proposal that the heteromeric complex is a hexamer composed of two trimers interacting via the L3 loops. In this report, the crystal structure of the transcriptionally active Smad4 fragment (S4AF), including the SAD and MH2 domains (residues 273­522), is described. The S4AF forms a trimer in the asymmetric unit, which packs in a similar manner to the crystallographic trimer of the MH2 domain. A model of transcription activation is presented on the basis of the SAD structure. The identification of sulfate-ion-binding sites also yields insight into the molecular basis of phosphorylation-induced heteromeric interaction between Smad4 and pathway-restricted SMAD proteins.

Results and discussion
The active Smad4 fragment forms an asymmetric trimer

The three-dimensional structure of the functionally active Smad4 fragment (S4AF; residues 273­552) was determined by molecular replacement using the Smad4 MH2 domain (319­543) coordinates as a search model (Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains three S4AF molecules, which pack in a similar manner to the proposed functional trimer of the Smad4 MH2 domain [35]. The final model of the S4AF trimer includes three non-equivalent subunits, ten sulfate ions, and 321 water molecules. The R and Rfree factors are 17.4% and 21.8%, respectively, for all data from 100­2.6 Å. The statistics for the overall stereochemistry of the S4AF model are excellent with root mean square deviations (rmsds) from standard geometry of 0.0058 Å for bond lengths and 1.207° for bond angles. The three S4AF subunits exhibit different degrees of disorder: subunit A contains residues 285­296, 311­460 and 487­545; subunit B contains residues 285­296, 307­469 and 479­552; subunit C contains residues 285­294, 312­468 and 479­552. Subunit B resembles subunit C in that additional electron density is visible for residues 458­469, 479­490 and the C-terminal tail residues 545­552. These regions interact to form a structural extension from the core, which is referred to as the TOWER (Figure 1). The corresponding regions are disordered in the previous structure of the Smad4 MH2 domain and partially disordered in subunit A. Consistent with subunit B and C having more closely related structures, the rmsd for C atoms (residues 319­456 and 490­543) between subunits B and C is slightly smaller (0.24 Å) than that between subunits A and B

Additional structural features in comparison to the previous MH2 domain model are shown in purple (subunit A), green (subunit B) and red (subunit C). Disordered regions are represented by dotted lines. The core of each subunit is composed of two twisted  sheets packing against each other. The TOWER, containing three helices and two  strands, forms a structural extension from the core. The SAD encompasses the base of the TOWER (behind the TOWER in this view) and forms a  strand along the core, extending  sheet A (top sheet in this view) from six to seven strands. Sulfate molecules are shown in ball-and-stick representation, and are colored according to their subunit association. The sulfate ion in site Sbc is colored yellow.

(0.29 Å) or between subunits A and C (0.30 Å). The rmsd values for C atoms between the Smad4 MH2 domain structure and each of the three S4AF subunits are 0.34, 0.32 and 0.36 Å, suggesting that there are no major structural differences over the superimposable region. Instead of forming a structural domain, the functionally defined Smad4-activation domain (SAD) [24], residues 274­322, forms part of the core structure (Figure 1). The SAD extends from the N terminus of the previous Smad4 MH2 domain structure as a loop (SAD loop), passes around the base of the TOWER, and forms a parallel  strand (SAD-) against strand 8. The presence of the SAD results in the extension of the twisted -sheet A from six to seven strands (Figure 1b). The locations of the ten sulfate ions are shown in Figure 1a. There are three sulfate-binding sites in each subunit. Sites 1 and 2 are located near the base of the TOWER, whereas site 3 is located near the L3 loop. They are referred to as sites Sa1, Sa2, Sa3, Sb1, Sb2, Sb3, Sc1, Sc2 and Sc3, on the basis of the sites and their subunit association. The tenth sulfate-binding site is located in-between subunits B and C near site Sc2, and is referred to as site Sbc.

The SAD sequence is highly proline-rich (27%). In the crystal structure of S4AF, the SAD forms two well-ordered structures (residues 285­296 and 307­318) separated by a disordered region (residues 297­306; Figure 2). Residues 288­291 form a parallel  strand (SAD-) along 8, and extend the twisted  sheet A (Figure 1b). Residues 307­318 form an extended loop structure (SAD loop) encompassing the base of the TOWER and connect to the MH2 domain. There are extensive interactions between the SAD and the MH2 domain, which contribute to stabilization of the core

structure and the TOWER. In addition to the -strand interactions between SAD- and 8, residues towards the N-terminal end of SAD- (residues 286­289) interact with the L3 loop and the loop N-terminal of 8, referred to as the L420 loop (Figure 2, right-hand inset). One prominent set of hydrogen-bonding interactions occurs between the guanidinyl group of Arg420 within the L420 loop and the

The SAD presents a proline-rich hydrophobic surface. The SAD is shown in green; disordered regions are represented by dotted lines. The inset on the left shows detailed interactions between the SAD loop and the base of the TOWER. Pro312 of the SAD loop has a mainchain hydrogen-bond interaction with the sidechain of Arg441, which is a target of tumorigenic mutation. The inset on the right shows

the detailed interactions of SAD-. Both Gly286 and His287 form mainchain hydrogen-bond interactions with the sidechain of Arg420, which is also a target of tumorigenic mutation.

backbone of residues 286 and 287 of SAD. Arg420 is a target of tumorigenic mutation in Smad4. The interaction between Arg420 and the SAD stabilizes SAD- as part of an extended structural core. Moreover, the His287 sidechain of SAD- wedges into the space between the L420 and L3 loops and interacts through van der Waals contacts. The extended structural core is further stabilized by hydrophobic interactions mediated by Leu288 of SAD-, Tyr513 of the L3 loop and Phe408 of 7. Residues C-terminal to SAD- contain a stretch of solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, PPMPP (single-letter amino acid notation). This region makes no interaction with the core and leads to a disordered region (residues 298­306) which is also hydrophobic in content (PGHYWPVHN). The SAD loop interacts with the base of the TOWER and the loop connecting 5 and 6 (referred to as the L390 loop) through hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2, left-hand inset). Most of the hydrogenbonding interactions are mediated between the TOWER sidechains and the SAD loop backbone. One of the hydrogen-bonding interactions is between the Arg441 sidechain and the Pro312 carbonyl oxygen. Arg441 is also a target of tumorigenic mutation in Smad4. The structure provides a

basis for mutation-induced tumorigenicity and underscores the role of SAD in Smad4 function. The interaction between the SAD loop and the TOWER is further stabilized through a hydrophobic center formed by Ile314 of the SAD loop and Leu535 and Leu440 of the TOWER. Most of the hydrophobic residues of the SAD loop are solvent-exposed. These residues include Phe310, Pro312, Pro313 and Pro318. The SAD thus presents an unusually proline-rich, hydrophobic surface which may mediate interaction with other proteins to activate transcription. Proline-rich sequences in transcription factors have been demonstrated to activate transcription. CTF (CCAAT box transcription factor)/NFI (nuclear factor I) and AP-2 (activator protein 2) are examples of a growing list of transcription factors that contain proline-rich activation domains [36­39]. How proline-rich sequences activate transcription is not understood, but the general view is that they are probably involved in docking with other transcription factors. The proline-rich SAD has been found to have an essential role in transcription activation and signaling synergism [11,24]. The structure of S4AF shows that these proline residues, together with the adjacent hydrophobic residues, are exposed on the surface of the protein. This

energetically unfavorable surface could be stabilized through hydrophobic interaction with a transcription partner. The transcription activation function of Smad4 SAD has recently been shown to depend on the coactivator p300, and to involve physical interaction between the SAD and the N terminus of p300 [40]. The corresponding SAD sequences in nonmammalian Smad4 isoforms are not highly conserved (Figure 3). Nevertheless, the proline-rich pattern remains characteristic of this region (15% proline in Drosophila, 14% in Caenorhabditis elegans). The sequence variation may reflect structural differences of the interacting partners for transcription activation.
The TOWER is poised for interaction

-sheet (t1 and t2) packing against the long helix (H3) at the distal end. At the top of the TOWER, residues 470­478, which connect the long helix and the returning  strand, are not observable as a result of disordering. In the crystal structure of the Smad4 MH2 domain, only the base of the TOWER was observed as a result of disordering of residues 457­491 and 544­552 [35]. The TOWER is a conserved feature in Smad4 and is absent in pathway-restricted SMAD proteins. Sequence alignment of SMAD proteins reveals that all Smad4 isoforms contain a unique insert of about 35 residues within the MH2 domain (Figure 3). This insert corresponds to residues 443­477 of human Smad4, which form the long helix (H3) extending from the base to the top of the TOWER. The insert contains sequence rich in glutamine and alanine residues. The glutamine-rich sequences belong to a class of activation domains known from transcription factors such as Sp1, Oct-1 and Oct-2 [37,41,42]. Although the structural basis of action for this class of transactivation domains is poorly understood, they are in general thought to mediate specific protein­protein contacts with other transcription partners. In the crystal structure of the human papillomavirus type 18 E2 activation domain, the N-terminal glutamine-rich activation sequence forms an amphipathic helix with the glutamine sidechains exposed to the solvent [43]. A similar disposition of the glutamine residues within the long helix of the TOWER suggests that they may have a similar role in transcription activation. The invariable AQAAAVAG motif (residues 460­467) within the insert of Smad4 isoforms is located at the distal end of

A distinct structural feature in subunits B and C of the S4AF trimer is the elongated cylindrical extension, the TOWER, which is ~50 Å in length and 20 Å in diameter and extends from the core. The axis of the extension is approximately perpendicular to the core  sheets. The TOWER is formed by two separate segments of the primary sequence, residues 440­500 and 531­552 (Figure 4). The segment from residues 440­500 extends from the core as a long helix (H3) to the top of the TOWER, returns forming a  strand (t1) to half-height, and becomes a helix (H4) returning to the core. The C-terminal segment from residues 531 to the C terminus protrudes from the core as a helix (H5) and transforms into a  strand (t2) extending to the top of the TOWER. The TOWER structure is stabilized through hydrophobic sidechain interactions of the three-helix bundle (H3, H4 and H5) at the base, as well as antiparallel

(Figure 5). In the context of the S4AF functional trimer, this putative transcription activation surface is located at the periphery of the trimeric disk. This surface is likely to be greatly altered in pathway-restricted SMAD proteins, as they do not possess the Smad4-specific insert within the TOWER. This unique surface in Smad4 may be able to recruit a specific transcription activator and contributes to the ability of Smad4 to synergize with pathwayrestricted SMAD proteins in signaling. The antiparallel -strand interaction in the TOWER, which ties up the C-terminal tail of Smad4, is unlikely to form in pathway-restricted SMAD proteins because of their reduced TOWER structure. This architectural alteration allows the conserved C-terminal phosphorylation sites of the pathway-restricted SMAD proteins to be freely accessible to kinases. The TOWER also contributes to a significant portion of the trimer interface (Figure 5). The helices H4 and H5 of the TOWER are involved in hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with helix H1 and loops L1, L2 of the neighboring subunit. The buried surface area of the S4AF trimer is larger than that of the MH2 domain trimer (5800 Å2 verus 4800 Å2) as a result of the ordering of the TOWER structure.

The electron density of sulfate ions (Sa1, Sa2 etc.) as shown by the Fo­Fc map. The map was calculated after simulated annealing refinement without including the coordinates of the sulfate ions. The map is contoured at the 5 level. The S4AF trimer is shown as a C trace. Subunits A, B and C are colored in blue, green and red, respectively.

Ten electron-density peaks consistent with bound sulfate ions from the crystallization medium were identified in the Fo­Fc map of the S4AF trimer (Figure 6). These peaks are above 5 in intensity, spherical in shape, and surrounded by basic residues. Sites 1, 2 and 3 are present in all three subunits at the same corresponding positions (Sa1, Sa2, Sa3, Sb1, Sb2, Sb3, Sc1, Sc2 and Sc3). Site Sbc is present between subunits B and C adjacent to site Sc2, and is the only site where the sulfate ion is coordinated by residues from two subunits. The current model suggests that phosphorylation of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins at the C-terminal consensus sequence, SS*XS*, drives heteromeric interaction with Smad4 via the C-terminal domain. A recent report showed that Smad4 binds specifically to the phosphorylated form of Smad2 C-terminal peptide, suggesting that the phosphorylated tail of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins bridges the heteromeric interaction [16]. As the chemistry and mode of binding of a sulfate ion is similar to that of a phosphate ion, the sulfate-binding sites identified in the S4AF trimer might correspond to the sites of interaction of the phosphorylated C-terminal tail. To fulfill the function of a receptor site for the phosphorylated C-terminal tail `ligand', the site should be conserved among Smad4 isoforms because of the conservation of the interacting phosphorylation sequence. Sulfate-binding site 1 is located at the base of the TOWER away from the trimer interface. The sulfate ion

is coordinated by the sidechains of Arg445 and Gln442 from the TOWER helix H3, and Arg416 from helix H2 (Figure 7a). This site is less likely to interact with the phosphorylated C-terminal tail because all three residues involved in sulfate binding are not conserved. Furthermore, the sulfate ion is simultaneously coordinated by the same set of residues from the symmetry-related subunits, suggesting that it has a role in crystal packing. The sulfate ion in site 2 is located at the base of the TOWER near the trimer interface. The sulfate ion is coordinated by the sidechains of Arg497 from helix H4 and Arg502 from strand 10 (Figure 7b). Arg497 and Arg502 are well conserved among Smad4 isoforms, with the exception that in C. elegans, the corresponding residue of Arg502 is an alanine. Sulfate-binding site 3 is located within the L3 loop. The sulfate ion is coordinated by the sidechains of Lys507 and Arg515, which are conserved in all SMAD proteins (Figure 7c). Sulfate-binding site Sbc is located in-between subunits B and C. The sulfate ion is coordinated by the sidechains of Arg496 and Arg497 from subunit C, and the sidechain of Arg372 and the backbone of Asn369 from subunit B (Figure 7d). These interactions are conserved among all Smad4 isoforms. Site Sbc is adjacent to site Sc2, forming a unique tandem sulfate-binding site. The two sulfate ions are 3.9 Å apart (sulfur to sulfur) and interact through hydrogen-bond interactions. The sites corresponding to Sbc in the other two interfaces do

not bind sulfate ions. Examination of the structure reveals that this is due to the asymmetric packing of the trimer in which the subunit interface between subunits B and C is uniquely juxtaposed to bind an additional sulfate ion (Figure 8). The analysis reveals two highly conserved locations on Smad4 that are candidate `receptors' for the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins. One is site 3 within the L3 loop, and the other comprises the tandem sulfate sites between subunits B and C (sites Sc2 and Sbc). It is interesting that the tandem arrangement of the sulfate ions in sites Sbc and Sc2 is reminiscent of the arrangement of the phosphoryl groups in the doubly phosphorylated C-terminal sequence. This
Figure 8 Subunit-to-subunit juxtaposition around the tandem sulfate ions are compared by a stereoview superimposition of subunit pairs B­C (red), A­B (green), C­A (blue) and two subunits of the symmetry-related MH2 domain trimer (yellow). Superimposition was performed on the C atoms of residues 493­502 of one subunit. The average displacements of the C atoms (residues 364­380) in comparison to the B­C pair are 1.16 Å (A­B pair), 0.57 Å (C­A pair) and 0.93 Å (MH2 domain pair). The maximum displacements are 1.88 Å (C 374), 0.94 Å (C 373) and 1.28 Å (C 374) for subunit pairs A­B, C­A and the MH2 domain, respectively.

unique location of the tandem sulfate ions in between subunits B and C is opposite to subunit A, which has a disordered TOWER structure mimicking the subunit of a pathway-restricted SMAD protein. Biochemical studies using lysates from cells transfected with SMAD expression plasmids suggested that the association between Smad4 and pathway-restricted SMAD protein may be heterotrimeric [47]. The oligomerization of SMAD proteins was studied in the basal state when no receptor kinase was cotransfected, or in the activated state when a constitutive type I receptor kinase was cotransfected. In this case, SMAD proteins exist mainly as monomers in the basal state and undergo homo- and hetero-oligomerization after activation. On a size-exclusion column, the Smad2­Smad4 heterocomplex elutes with smaller apparent molecular weight than the Smad2 homo-oligomer, which is inconsistent with the hexamer model. The S4AF trimer in the asymmetric unit may suggest how heterotrimeric interactions occur. A 2:1 complex composed of two Smad4 subunits (subunits B and C) and one pathway-restricted SMAD protein subunit (subunit A) can form upon phosphorylation. The phosphorylated C-terminal tail of the pathway-restricted SMAD subunit extends to the interface between two Smad4 subunits to tighten the interaction (Figure 9). This model requires the phosphorylated C-terminal ten residues to be in the extended conformation. The model suggests that phosphorylation will tighten the trimeric interactions, which is in agreement with the observation that SMAD proteins exist as monomers in solution, and oligomerize upon receptormediated phosphorylation [47]. An alternative model proposes site 3 within the L3 loop of Smad4 as the `receptor' for the phosphorylated C-terminal tail. Although this site contains only a single sulfate ion in all three subunits, there are additional highly conserved basic residues nearby (Arg378 and Lys428) which could potentially interact with the doubly phosphorylated C-terminal sequence. Utilization of the L3 loop in heteromeric interactions has been proposed to occur through the flat

The structure suggests that two classes of transactivation sequences may cooperate in mediating transcription activation. This potential transactivation surface is likely to be different in pathway-restricted SMAD proteins.

Smad4 Smad4

A model for phosphorylation-induced heterotrimerization between Smad4 and pathway-restricted SMAD proteins is proposed on the basis of structural inference and previous biochemical results. Phosphorylation bridges two types of SMAD proteins, each possessing a unique transactivation surface, through tightening of the conserved trimer interface. Thus, a conserved phosphorylation switch is used to generate signal diversity by bridging heterologous SMAD complexes, which turn on specific genes through recruiting distinct coactivators.

Materials and methods
Protein expression and purification
The coding region of S4AF, corresponding to residues 273­552 of human Smad4/DPC4, was subcloned into the pGEX expression vector (Pharmacia) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach. The recombinant S4AF was overexpressed at room temperature in Escherichia coli. The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused S4AF in the cell extract was absorbed to glutathione­sepharose 4B beads and released by thrombin digestion after extensive washing. S4AF was further purified on a DEAE­sepharose fast-flow column using a NaCl gradient from 10­300 mM. Purified fractions were concentrated to 40 mg/ml.

The three monomers are shown in different colors.

surface of two trimers, which results in a hexamer [22]. Further investigations will be required to discriminate between these models.

Protein crystallization
Crystals of S4AF were grown at room temperature using the hangingdrop vapor diffusion method. Purified S4AF (40 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution containing 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% PEG 4000 and 200 mM LiSO4. Small crystals appeared within two days which were used to perform macroseeding under the conditions of 100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 8% PEG 4000 and 200 mM LiSO4. Crystals suitable for diffraction experiments (0.2 mm in dimensions) grew within one week.

Biological implications
The transforming growth factor  (TGF-) family of cytokines regulate cellular processes of diverse organisms by switching on a class of transcription factors named SMAD proteins. Following ligand-induced receptor kinase activation, the phosphorylated forms of pathway-restricted SMAD proteins form active complexes with Smad4, which shuttle into the nucleus to turn on specific genes. The first functionally active Smad4 structure (S4AF) is presented here. S4AF contains the C-terminal domain of Smad4 (the MH2 domain) together with a prolinerich region (the SMAD-activation domain; SAD) which is indispensable for Smad4 signaling and transcription functions. The SAD structure encompasses the periphery of the functional S4AF trimer, exposing its proline-rich hydrophobic residues to the solvent. This unfavorable display of hydrophobic surface is stabilized by the flanking sequences that interact with the structural core. The structure therefore suggests a general means by which proline-rich transactivation sequences can be disposed on transcription factors for interaction with coactivators. The SAD is located on the same face

X-ray data collection and processing
Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at room temperature using an RAXIS IV image plate system mounted on a Rigaku rotating-anode generator running at 50 kV, 100 mA. The detector distance was 150 mm, the oscillation angle 1°, and the exposure time 30 min. The starting spindle angle and scan range for data collection was optimized using the software STRATEGY [48]. The diffraction data were processed and merged using the DENZO/SCALEPACK software packages [49]. The data collection statistics are shown in Table 1.

Structure determination
The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the CNS software package [50]. The Smad4 MH2 domain monomer was used as the search model [35] to locate the three S4AF molecules in the asymmetric unit of the space group I4(1)22 using rotation and translation functions of CNS. After rigid-body refinement, the R factor was 35.4%. The calculated map immediately revealed the presence of additional density for the SAD region. Initial positional refinement and model building was performed with strict noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operator on, which lowered the Rfree factor to 29.0%. Subsequent positional refinement and model building were performed without the NCS operator, which brought the Rfree factor down to

27%. Inclusion of water molecules at this stage lowered the Rfree to 25%. Refinement and model building with the simulated annealing omit maps protocol removed model bias at several regions. Sulfate molecules were built in at the final stage, which brought the Rfree to 21.80%. Model building was performed using CHAIN [51]. The final statistics of the refinement are shown in Table 1.
