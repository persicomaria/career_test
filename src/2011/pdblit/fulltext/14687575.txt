Interconversion of D-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and D-ribulose-5-phosphate is an important step in the pentose phosphate pathway. Two unrelated enzymes with R5P isomerase activity were first identified in Escherichia coli, RpiA and RpiB. In this organism, the essential 5-carbon sugars were thought to be processed by RpiA, while the primary role of RpiB was suggested to instead be interconversion of the rare 6-carbon sugars D-allose6-phosphate (All6P) and D-allulose-6-phosphate. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, where only an RpiB is found, the 5-carbon sugars are believed to be the enzyme's primary substrates. Here, we present kinetic studies examining the All6P isomerase activity of the RpiBs from these two organisms and show that only the E. coli enzyme can catalyze the reaction efficiently. All6P instead acts as an inhibitor of the M. tuberculosis enzyme in its action on R5P. X-ray studies of the M. tuberculosis enzyme co-crystallized with All6P and 5deoxy-5-phospho-D-ribonohydroxamate (an inhibitor designed to mimic the 6-carbon sugar) and comparison with the E. coli enzyme's structure allowed us to identify differences in the active sites that explain the kinetic results. Two other structures, that of a mutant E. coli RpiB in which histidine 99 was changed to asparagine and that of wild-type M. tuberculosis enzyme, both co-crystallized with the substrate ribose-5-phosphate, shed additional light on the reaction mechanism of RpiBs generally. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

All6P Isomerase Activity of RpiBs

Introduction
D-Ribose-5-phosphate isomerase (Rpi; E.C. 5.3.1.6) is one of the major enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway, where it catalyzes the interconversion of D-ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) and Dribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P). Two forms of this isomerase with no amino acid sequence similarity have been characterized in Escherichia coli, RpiA and RpiB. 1,2 EcRpiB is not important under most conditions, not only because it is not constitutively expressed but also because its rate of catalysis is much slower. It has been proposed that the principal role of this enzyme is instead to catalyze the isomerization of two 6-carbon sugars, D-allose-6phosphate (All6P) and D -allulose-6-phosphate (Allu6P). The physiological significance has not yet been demonstrated, but it is known that EcRpiB is associated with an operon that is necessary for survival when D-allose is the sole carbon source.3,4 The operon encodes a repressor (alsR), three ABC transporter proteins (alsBAC), a putative All6P 3epimerase (alsE) and a D-allokinase (alsK). The structure of the periplasmic D-allose-binding protein AlsB solved in complex with D-allose supports the idea that the transport system specifically recognizes that sugar.5 Activity measurements with AlsK have further shown that D-allose is phosphorylated with a kcat value of 17 s- 1 and a Km value of 0.3 mM, consistent with values obtained for similar enzymes when processing their cognate sugars.6 The rpiB gene lies just upstream of this operon and is under the control of the same AlsR repressor, also known as RpiR.2 However, EcRpiB's ability to catalyze the desired isomerization reaction had not been demonstrated. One particularly puzzling aspect of this theory, however, is the fact that D-allose and D-allulose (also known as D-psicose) are so-called rare sugars, not generally considered in cellular metabolism. Naturally occurring D-allose has been found in small amounts in ester glucosides, flavonoids and iridoids in various plant species.7­9 Humans cannot utilize Dallose, and other than E. coli, only certain Archaea have been reported to use the sugar in vivo.10 Like E. coli, the archaeons are proposed to incorporate Dallose into metabolism by converting it to Dfructose-6-phosphate. In vitro experiments have shown that L-rhamnose isomerase from Pseudomonas stutzeri and RpiB from Clostridium thermocellum can convert D-allulose into D-allose.11,12 These studies were aimed at finding a cost-efficient means of producing D-allose, due to its reported medical applications.13 We do not know of any evidence that the organisms themselves utilize the enzymes in the metabolism of D-allose. Like many bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis lacks an RpiA sequence, having only an RpiB gene; in the genome, the sequence coding for MtRpiB has been annotated as rv2465c.14 It is presumed that the major role of MtRpiB lies within the pentose phosphate pathway, since ribose is of

central importance in any living organism. We have previously solved the three-dimensional structure of MtRpiB [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry code 1USL]15 and demonstrated that it catalyzes the R5P isomerization with kinetic constants very similar to those reported for EcRpiB.16 Comparison with the EcRpiB structure (entry code 1NN4)16 indicated that while the two proteins are very similar, some key active-site residues are different. X-ray structures of MtRpiB in complex with two substrate analogues (entry codes 2BES and 2BET)17 allowed us to assign roles for most of the active-site residues in the 5-carbon sugar reaction (Fig. 1). Kinetic studies with a compound designed to mimic the enediolate intermediate of the proposed All6P reaction, 5-deoxy-5-phospho-D-ribonohydroxamate (5PRH), have shown that a 6-carbon sugar analogue can inhibit the R5P isomerization in MtRpiB with a Ki value of 0.4 mM.18 Here, we present kinetic studies showing that EcRpiB can catalyze the conversion of All6P to Allu6P with reasonable efficiency but that MtRpiB cannot. All6P instead acts as an inhibitor of MtRpiB in the isomerization of R5P. X-ray structures of MtRpiB co-crystallized with All6P and 5PRH reveal differences in the active sites that explain the kinetic results. Two other structures co-crystallized with R5P, an EcRpiB H99N mutant and wild-type MtRpiB, shed additional light on the reaction mechanism of RpiBs.

Results
Activity of EcRpiB and MtRpiB EcRpiB and MtRpiB were tested for activity on R5P and All6P. Confirming earlier results,15,16 the two enzymes have very similar kcat and Km values for R5P. Allu6P production was followed using a novel assay based on the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) colorimetric method previously designed for monitoring D-fructose-6-phosphate production.19 Figure 2a­d shows the experimental data, and Table 1 summarizes the catalytic constants derived. EcRpiB has a lower Km value for All6P than for R5P, although the latter is processed at a 10-fold faster rate. The calculated kcat/Km differs by only 4-fold when R5P and All6P are compared. MtRpiB is less efficient at isomerizing All6P, having a much higher K m value and a drastically lower kcat value. Furthermore, All6P acts as an inhibitor of the reaction when R5P is used as substrate, with a measured IC50 of 2 mM; Allu6P is a slightly worse inhibitor, with an IC50 of 6.3 mM (Fig. 2e and f). MtRpiB complex structures X-ray data were collected for wild-type MtRpiB co-crystallized with the substrate R5P and the

inhibitors 5PRH and All6P. The three models were refined to resolutions of 2 Å or better (Table 2). Each asymmetric unit contained five molecules, organized as two complete dimers plus one lone subunit that forms a dimer by virtue of a 2-fold crystallographic symmetry axis. In all cases, the protein could be traced from residue 2 or 3 to residue 158 or 160, out of the 172 residues in the sequence. The Nterminal His tag was not seen in the electron density. The two active sites of an MtRpiB dimer are located in clefts between the two subunits, with components drawn from both molecules; with the exception of Arg113, interactions with residue numbers less than 100 arise from the A molecule, and the others from the B molecule. A cartoon representation is shown in Fig. 3a. The electron density in the active site was well defined and showed that the ligand was bound in all five molecules of the asymmetric unit in all three structures. In the R5P complex (Fig. 3b), little or no furanose form of R5P was present; the electron density was most consistent with a mixture of the linear forms of both R5P and Ru5P. This observation is in agreement with the equilibrium constant value of  0.33 reported for the isomerization of R5P.23 At 1.65-Å resolution, it is not possible to investigate the relative proportions in detail, and both R5P and Ru5P were included in the refinement at an occupancy of 0.5, which resulted in well-behaved maps and temperature factors for the ligands that

were similar to those of the surrounding protein (15­ 20 Å2). The manner in which R5P and Ru5P bind in the active site of MtRpiB is highly similar to the binding of the substrate analogue inhibitor 4-deoxy4-phospho-D-erythronohydroxamic acid (4PEH) (Fig. 1).17 The two structures superimpose with an r.m.s. difference of 0.2 Å when all C atoms of the five protein molecules of the asymmetric unit are aligned. The active-site residues are positioned in the same way, except in the immediate neighborhood of the catalytic base Glu75, where the carboxylate moiety assumes slightly different angles in the two models (Fig. 3b). The density seen in the active sites when MtRpiB was co-crystallized with 5PRH does not account for the whole ligand (Fig. 4a), and we concluded that the compound had been hydrolyzed to produce another good inhibitor, 5-deoxy-5-phospho-D-ribonate (5PRA) (Fig. 1). 5PRA binds with the phosphate group in the same position as for the R5P, with interactions to residues Arg113 and His12 in the A molecule and to residues Arg137 and Arg141 in the B molecule. The proposed ring-opening catalyst, His102-B,17 interacts with O4, while O3 makes a hydrogen bond with Asp11-A; both interactions are seen in the other structures. Differences in binding occur at the top of the ligand, where O2 of 5PRA lies in the same position as C1 of the substrate and hydrogen bonds to Glu75-A, C1 of 5PRA points in the same direction as O2 of the substrate and the carboxylate moiety interacts with Glu75 and the

backbone nitrogen atoms of the oxyanion hole (Fig. 4a). The interactions of O2 and one of the carboxylate oxygens of 5PRA to the two carboxylate oxygens of Glu75-A involve short and tight hydrogen bonds of 2.7 and 2.4 Å, respectively. This implies that at least one of the partners in each case is protonated. These crystals were grown in the 2- presence of 0.2 M Li2SO4, and two molecules of SO4 are also found in the electron density. Neither ion appears to have an important role in the structure, although they may enhance dimer and crystallographic contacts. In the MtRpiB/All6P complex, the density in the active site (Fig. 4b) reveals the -pyranose (sixmembered ring) form of the sugar phosphate, in contrast to the linear forms of the sugars discussed

above. The ring oxygen (O5) of All6P assumes the position expected for the ring oxygen (O4) of R5P. Asp11-A interacts with O4, which also has a hydrogen bond to the backbone nitrogen of Gly70Table 1.

A. The group with most hydrogen-bonding contacts is O3, which interacts with both oxygens of the Glu75-A side chain and the backbone nitrogens of Gly70-A and Ser71-A. The side chains of Ser71-A and Asn103-B, as well as the backbone nitrogen of Gly74-A, have hydrogen bonds to O2. O1, observed as the -anomer, interacts only with His102. Tyr46A, a conserved residue in all RpiBs, lies with its ring almost parallel with the sugar ring and  4 Å away (Fig. 4b). Favorable stacking interactions between the aromatic side chain of the protein and the nonpolar surface of the sugar ring are expected. The EcRpiB H99N mutant An EcRpiB His99-to-Asn mutant constructed by site-directed mutagenesis exhibited a Km value for R5P of 0.8 mM, similar to the wild-type enzyme, but the kcat value was reduced to 2 s- 1, as compared with 52 s- 1 (Table 1). EcRpiB H99N was crystallized together with the substrate R5P in a space group different from that observed for the original apo EcRpiB crystals.16 Six molecules were located in the asymmetric unit by

molecular replacement, arranged as 1 dimer and 1 tetramer. The final model was refined to 2.1 Å resolution. The electron density allowed the structure to be traced from residue 1 (not including the 6His tag) to residue 146 or 147 in all 6 molecules (out of 149 residues in total). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 2. In each active site, density strongly suggests a mixture of the - and -furanose forms of R5P, together with linear R5P or Ru5P. Interestingly, the two active sites in each dimer have different species bound. One active site (molecules A, D and F) has primarily the linear form and very little furanose (Fig. 5a). The other subunit of each dimer (molecules B, C and E) has mostly furanose sugar, but with a considerable fraction of the linear form (Fig. 5b). The distinctions were even clearer when density from the equivalent active sites was averaged. The differences can be traced back to crystal packing and involve different conformations of the His17 side chain located on the surface of the first helix. In the A, D and F molecules, the histidine points toward Phe13-A, possibly shielding it from water. In the B, C and E molecules, this histidine points

straight out toward a symmetry-related molecule's Arg133 (Fig. 5c and d). This arginine is involved in binding the phosphate group of the ligand; in the active sites that have the His17/Arg133 interaction, the predominant form of the substrate is the furanose. Other residues in the same helix, glutamates 18 and 25, could form salt links to Arg40 of the neighboring active site, although the density for this arginine is not well defined. It is presumably interacting with the phosphate of the ligand some of the time, as well as with the neighboring glutamates. In the -furanose form of R5P, O1 interacts with Asn100-A and is close to one of the carbon atoms of

interactions apart from O1, which in this case is  3.4 Å from Asn99. Comparisons of available RpiB structures Comparison of the mutant EcRpiB AB dimer with the original wild-type EcRpiB AD dimer (PDB entry code 1NN4) shows that the r.m.s. difference is only

0.3 Å for 287 C atoms using a cutoff of 0.8 Å. The small changes include several residues with alternative side-chain conformations. The most striking difference is the conformation of Thr68, which now has its OH group oriented in the same direction as that of the equivalent serine residue in MtRpiB. We believe this to represent a minor error in the original structure.

674 The various MtRpiB models are also very similar, with r.m.s. differences between 0.15 and 0.36 Å when comparing the AB dimers. As mentioned previously, the MtRpiB with R5P is very similar to the PDB entry 2BES, the complex of the same enzyme with 4PEH. Superpositioning of the EcRpiB H99N model onto the different MtRpiBs gives an r.m.s. difference of  1 Å, with 265 C atoms of the AB dimers matching within a cutoff of 2 Å (Fig. 6a). The only other RpiBs in the PDB represent the enzymes from Thermotoga maritima (TmRpiB; entry code 1O1X24) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpRpiB; entry code 2PPW, unpublished data). The TmRpiB crystal structure only has one molecule in the asymmetric unit that forms a dimer through crystallographic symmetry. The subunit when aligned to EcRpiB has an r.m.s. difference of 0.8 Å, with 137 C atoms matching within a cutoff of 2.0 Å. With MtRpiB, such an alignment resulted in an r.m.s. difference of 0.9 Å for 129 C atoms, with two gaps in the alignment. SpRpiB does not align as well to the two RpiBs studied here, and the sequences have low identity. However, the general topology is very similar, with the main differences in the loops connecting the secondary structural elements; the C-terminal end also has additional helices that extend the fold of the subunit. Comparisons of RpiB active sites When EcRpiB and MtRpiB are superimposed, the transformation brings the C atoms of the Nterminal end of the helix at the bottom of the active-site cleft very close together. The backbone nitrogen atoms of the helix (residues 70­74 in MtRpiB) are thought to be important for stabilizing the cis-enediolate intermediate of the reaction (Fig. 1). The active-site base, a glutamic acid in MtRpiB and a cysteine in EcRpiB, originates from different positions in the sequence; Glu75 of MtRpiB lies at the N-terminal end of the helix, while Cys66 of EcRpiB is located in the loop preceding it. However, as noted previously,15 the side chains terminate in the same position within the active site (Fig. 6b). The side-chain hydroxyl

groups of Ser71 of MtRpiB and Thr68 of EcRpiB (the proposed proton shuttle between O1 and O2 of the substrate in the isomerization step) lie on top of each other, as do those of Asp11/Asp9-A (naming for MtRpiB/EcRpiB), Tyr46/Tyr43-A and Arg141/ Arg137-B. Differences are seen in the arrangement of histidines 12/10-A, 102/99-B and 138/134-B and Arg137/Arg133-B; most residues of EcRpiB are shifted by 1­2 Å relative to MtRpiB, although the C atoms of His10/His12 are closer. The shifts seen in the residues of the B molecule appear to originate from the substitution of Gln94 in MtRpiB with Tyr91 in EcRpiB. The bulky tyrosine side chain causes Leu98/Leu95 to take on different conformations. In EcRpiB, the leucine is forced down toward Asn99 (the mutated residue), which in turn pushes His134 down (Fig. 6b). In all MtRpiB structures presented here, Arg113-A interacts with the phosphate group; in the original apo structure (PDB entry code 1USL), this residue had two conformations, one pointing toward the phosphate and one pointing out into the solution. In EcRpiB, the equivalent Arg110 is not involved in phosphate binding (Fig. 6b). Although the phosphate group interacts with a similar set of positively charged residues, its density places this part of a bound ligand slightly farther away from the catalytic groups in EcRpiB when compared with the situation in all the MtRpiB complexes. In TmRpiB, the active-site residues align reasonably well with those of the other two RpiBs. The active-site cysteine, which aligns perfectly with Cys66 of EcRpiB, was found to be oxidized and so was modeled as a cysteine sulfonic acid.24 This causes Thr67 to move slightly. Tyr91 of EcRpiB is replaced with Asp90, but Arg93 in TmRpiB causes a slight downward movement of Leu94 compared with this leucine in MtRpiB. Thus, His98 and His133 lie between the equivalent histidines in MtRpiB and EcRpiB. Arg132 points out into the solution, as there is no phosphate in the active site to hold it in position. Arg136 is slightly farther away from the location where the phosphate would be expected to bind.

675 to that of E. coli, with the same gene organization and protein sequence identities ranging between 60% and 90%.

The residues lining the active site of SpRpiB are more variable. However, the C atoms at the Nterminal end of the helix in the active site (with the sequence CGTGVG), which also include the catalytic cysteine and threonine residues, align perfectly. Asn100 and Tyr43 are also conserved. Asp9 of the E. coli enzyme is replaced by a glutamate in SpRpiB, and His10 is missing, although a serine (Ser10) in this position could have interactions with the phosphate moiety of a ligand. A further candidate for a phosphate-binding residue is Arg147 of a symmetry-related molecule. His99 and His134 are absent from the S. pneumoniae sequence, but a glutamic acid (Glu151, again from the symmetryrelated molecule) is found in the equivalent position, approximately between the two histidines. Sequence comparisons BLAST 25 searches of all completed genomes where protein sequences have been deduced (777 bacterial, 45 archaeal and 48 eukaryotic, at the time of writing), using the E. coli RpiA and RpiB sequences as probes, showed that many organisms, mainly bacteria, have both genes. Both types of RpiB sequence, as represented by MtRpiB and EcRpiB, are common. The most significant differences between the two subfamilies are the nature of the catalytic base (glutamate or cysteine) and its position in the sequence. Other residues implicated in catalysis are well conserved, except for Ser71 (MtRpiB numbering). In EcRpiB, this residue is a threonine, but serines are also observed in E. coli-like Rpi's. MtRpiB-like enzymes are mainly found in the actinobacterial phylum, while the EcRpiB-like protein appears scattered through all the other bacterial families. TmRpiB belongs to the E. coli-like family, with a sequence identity of 46% to EcRpiB. No RpiA is observed in its genome. The same can be said for the genome of C. thermocellum where the RpiB has a sequence identity of 57% to EcRpiB. In Archaea, Thermofilum pendens is the only representative with a sequenced genome that has an EcRpiB-like enzyme. All others only have an RpiA. Unfortunately, no Rpi sequence that can survive on allose could be identified for the archaeal species Aerobacter aerogenes;10 few of this organism's genes have been sequenced as yet. Most eukaryotes only have an RpiA, although there are some examples of fungal species that also have an EcRpiB-like enzyme. Entamoeba histolytica, Trypanosoma species and Giardia lamblia are noteworthy as eukaryotes that only have an EcRpiB-like protein. Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum, Robiginitalea biformata, Blastopirellula marina and some organisms within actinobacteria have both types of RpiB but no RpiA. Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 and Reinekea sp. MED297 are the only two organisms known at present to have an MtRpiB together with an RpiA. Apart from E. coli, only two other organisms (with completed genome sequences) appear to have the als operon: Yersinia intermedia and Haemophilus somnus. Of these, the operon of Y. intermedia is most similar

Discussion
Aggregation state In the first EcRpiB apo structure,16 the enzyme was found as a tetramer, an observation that was also supported by dynamic light-scattering experiments. However, the enzyme had previously been found to behave as a dimer during size-exclusion chromatography.1,2 The tetramer seen in the crystal was thought to be partly due to the long N-terminal His tag, which would promote dimer­dimer interactions. The high protein concentrations used in crystallization and light-scattering experiments would also be expected to favor tetramer formation. In this study, a construct with a shorter N-terminal His tag was used; the protein still behaved as a dimer during size-exclusion chromatography. However, the dimer­dimer interactions that build the tetramer are still observed in the new crystal form, resulting from both non-crystallographic symmetry and crystallographic symmetry. We conclude that both dimer and tetramer are likely to be relevant species for this enzyme in solution. Ring opening This study with the MtRpiB-R5P complex demonstrates that the linear substrate or product does indeed bind in the same manner as the high-energy intermediate analogue studied earlier, 4PEH.17 It was considered likely that RpiB is involved in opening the R5P furanose ring, since only 0.1% of the sugar is in the linear form in solution.26 We previously proposed that His102 of MtRpiB catalyzes this opening by donating a proton to O4 of the furanose. The EcRpiB H99N mutant presented here is a conservative substitution of the equivalent histidine. Consistent with the proposed role, the mutant protein had a Km value similar to the wild type but a 26-fold lower kcat value (Table 1). A comparable mutation in Trypanosoma cruzi RpiB, where His102 was changed to alanine, resulted in an enzyme with Km values for both R5P and Ru5P similar to the wild-type enzyme.27 The kcat value was 10-fold lower in the forward reaction, whereas it was almost the same for the reverse reaction. This implies that the mutant enzymes have no difficulty in performing the isomerization when they are given a linear substrate but that they are slower if most of the substrate is in the ring form, as they must wait for an open R5P molecule to diffuse into the active site. These conclusions are supported by comparison of the structures of wild-type MtRpiB and EcRpiB H99N co-crystallized with R5P. In the wild-type protein, only linear forms of the sugar were observed in the active site (Fig. 4a), while in the

676 mutant protein, the observed density corresponds to - and/or -ribofuranose-5-phosphate as well as linear molecules (Fig. 5a and b). The docking of either furanose in the active-site density of EcRpiB H99N places O4 of the sugar in close proximity to Asn99. In MtRpiB, O4 of both linear sugars lies next to the equivalent His102 (Fig. 6b). The role of His99/ His102 as a facilitator of ring opening thus seems clear. At the same time as the histidine donates a proton to O4 of the furanose, a second proton must be accepted from O1. Docking the -furanose in the EcRpiB H99N active site places O1 less than 3 Å from a water molecule that lies close to His134 and Arg137. This water molecule could accept the proton from O1. An equivalent water molecule is found near His138 and Arg141 in MtRpiB. The anomer would situate O1 within hydrogen-bonding distance of Asn100/Asn103, which cannot accept a proton. The only candidates for proton acceptors in this case are His99/His102 itself and the water molecule. Thus, for the -anomer, it is possible that His99/His102 protonates O4 and deprotonates O1 in a concerted mechanism. An alternate scenario is that the water could donate a proton to O4 and His99/His102 accepts that from O1. Substrate specificity The kinetic data show that EcRpiB is a much more effective catalyst than MtRpiB of the All6P­Allu6P interconversion (Table 1). Indeed, the 6-carbon sugar is an inhibitor of MtRpiB when R5P is a substrate. Our numerous attempts to obtain the structure of a complex of EcRpiB with All6P resulted only in uninterpretable electron density in the active site. A mixture of sugar forms is presumably present, similar to the results described above for MtRpiB when crystallized together with R5P. By contrast, in the MtRpiB/All6P complex, we observe very clear density for the pyranose that is expected to be most common for All6P in solution. Although the ratio of :-allopyranose is about 1:3 in D2O solution,26 the density in the active site of MtRpiB/All6P shows only the -anomer (Fig. 4b). The preference is explained by the fact that the -anomer has one additional hydrogen bond to protein (involving His102) compared with a docked -anomer. The ring oxygen (O5) of All6P assumes the position expected for the ring oxygen (O4) of the substrate R5P. O5 also forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule interacting with His138, although the distance to His102 is greater than that in the EcRpiB H99N structure. Thus, we conclude that His102 and the water molecule near His138 should be able to catalyze opening of the All6P pyranose ring. The equivalent groups will have the same roles in EcRpiB. In MtRpiB, the problems seem to arise at the next step. Once opened, the sugar phosphate is too long to fit into the MtRpiB active site with productive interactions to Glu75 and Ser71. In the All6P structure, Glu75 is already forced up, away from the ligand, incorrectly situated to catalyze the isomerization (Fig. 4b). We earlier proposed that the

long and flexible arginine and histidine side chains that interact with the phosphate moiety of a substrate/inhibitor could swing farther away from the catalytic residues and so accommodate the longer 6-carbon substrate.18 We see no evidence from the combined structures that such is the case. However, differences that appear relevant are observed in the structures of EcRpiB and MtRpiB, which can be traced back to two residue substitutions. A Tyr91/Gln94 (EcRpiB/MtRpiB) substitution allows Leu95 of EcRpiB to take on a different conformation compared with the equivalent Leu98 in MtRpiB, bringing it down toward His99. This results in a shift of the two histidines (99 and 134) even further down toward the active-site opening compared with their equivalents in MtRpiB (Fig. 6b). This shift places them in a good position for opening a furanose or pyranose ring placed farther along the active site. The second change involves Arg40 in EcRpiB, which is replaced by Asp43 in MtRpiB. This residue is located in a loop at the very entrance to the active site (Fig. 6). In MtRpiB, the aspartic acid consistently points out into the surrounding solution, repelled by the overall negative charge of the phosphate. In the available EcRpiB structures, Arg40 frequently has poorly resolved density, although it is seen to bind the phosphate group when it is ordered. Minor differences between EcRpiB and MtRpiB include slight shifts in the phosphate-binding residues His10/His12 and Arg133/Arg137, which might make them better adapted to binding a phosphate molecule slightly farther away from the catalytic residues. However, these movements are less clearly linked to an amino acid substitution and may be simply due to natural flexibility in these residues. Attempts to produce a structure of EcRpiB bound to 5PRH, a compound designed to mimic the enediolate intermediate of the All6P reaction, were unsuccessful. Similar experiments with MtRpiB produced clear electron density for a hydrolysis product, 5PRA. 5PRA lacks the terminal N-hydroxylamino group that mimics the C1H(fO) group of the All6P substrate (Fig. 1). The crystallization conditions and long time needed for the experiment are such that the hydrolysis could reasonably occur. Comparable breakdown of 5-deoxy-5-phospho-Darabinohydroxamic acid to give 5-deoxy-5-phospho-D-arabinonate was reported to take place in co-crystallization experiments with phosphoglucose isomerase.28 It would appear that MtRpiB selectively binds the shorter R5P-like molecule (Fig. 4a), in preference to the original All6P-like compound. The isomerization of All6P and Allu6P in EcRpiB is thought to proceed in much the same manner as the isomerization of the 5-carbon sugar phosphate. The ring will presumably be opened by His99 and the water molecule. Once opened, the linear substrate will bind with its top part in the same orientation as observed for R5P in the MtRpiB structure and consistent with the docking of the linear substrate in EcRpiB H99N. Binding of the phosphate group lower down in the active site

allows the 6-carbon molecule to be placed in this way. The proposed catalytic base, Cys66, will then accept a proton from C2, and Thr68 will catalyze the proton transfer between O1 and O2 of the enediolate intermediate. The positive helix dipole near residues 67­71, together with Asn100, will help bind and so stabilize the high-energy intermediate. Tyr43, which presumably has some favorable stacking interactions with the ring form of the substrate that will assist substrate binding (Fig. 4b shows this interaction in MtRpiB with Tyr46), could possibly have an additional role in fixing the position of Asn100 via a hydrogen-bonding interaction. In the final step of catalysis, Cys66 returns a proton to C1. The biological significance of the All6P­Allu6P isomerization remains a mystery. From exhaustive sequence searches, we conclude that all completed genomes (covering nearly 1000 organisms) have at least one type of Rpi. Where RpiA is found, it is assumed that the main role for the enzyme is to interconvert R5P and Ru5P. Where only an RpiB exists (regardless of the subfamily), similar conclusions can be drawn with regard to its main function. Slow-growing organisms are best suited to this latter scenario, because of the lower catalytic efficiency of RpiBs. In cases where an organism has two Rpi's, one of them could have another secondary function. The combination of an MtRpiBlike enzyme and an RpiA is apparently very rare. Since MtRpiB-like enzymes are most efficient when processing the 5-carbon sugars, that combination offers no particular advantage; the RpiA is already quite adequate for the task. When two enzymes are present, either an RpiA/EcRpiB combination or an MtRpiB/EcRpiB combination, the EcRpiB-like enzyme is likely to take on a different role in metabolism. The most relevant substrate is probably a 6-carbon sugar, although not necessarily All6P. At present, the best evidence that All6P is the true biological substrate of EcRpiB is found in the structure of the D-allose-binding protein in the associated operon;5 typical of complexes between such transport receptors and their cognate ligand, the interactions observed are numerous, tightly networked and suggestive of high specificity. The only other organisms where a complete als operon could be identified were Y. intermedia and H. somnus. Y. intermedia is mainly associated with waste water, although it is found in humans with gastrointestinal disorders. H. somnus can cause disease in humans and cattle; it inhabits mucous membranes and is found in the bloodstream. As E. coli resides in the gut, it seems possible that all three of these organisms are adapted to utilizing allose that accumulates through mammals' inability to metabolize the sugar. By virtue of a high-affinity transport system, the organism can accumulate the sugar, even when it is present at very low concentrations in the media. Links to pathogenicity provide for tempting speculation, but the bias of the currently available genome data toward pathogens suggests that this idea must be treated with caution.

Experimental Procedures
Protein cloning, production and purification EcRpiB was cloned into the pBAD/TOPOTM vector (Invitrogen) using the pCRT7/TOPOTM construct previously described16 as the DNA template. An N-terminal 6-His tag was added to the sequence (GenBank accession number X82203; residues 1703­2147) using the primer 5-ATGGCCCATCATCATCATCATCATTCTGGT-3. The gene for thioredoxin, which is present in the original pBAD vector, was removed by restriction enzyme digestion with NcoI. A QuickChange® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene was used to construct the H99N mutant using the primer 5-GCGCAACTTTGCCGGCAGAATAACGACACCAACGTGC-3 and the inverse compliment 5-GCACGTTGGTGTCGTTATTCTGCCGCGAAAGTTGCGC-3 with Pfu Turbo® polymerase. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing at the Uppsala Genome Center. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli Top10 cells (Invitrogen) by heat shock. Recombinant protein was produced at 37 °C in a 1-L culture of Luria broth supplemented with 50 g/mL of ampicillin, which was induced with L-arabinose at 0.2% (w/v) once the A550 had reached 0.8. Cells were harvested after 4 h and stored at -20 °C. EcRpiB was purified in much the same manner as MtRpiB, as previously described.15 Differences from the original protocol include cell lysis at 2 kbar using a cell disruptor from Cell Disruption Systems and a final purification step by size-exclusion chromatography with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). For crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 8 mg/mL and the buffer was changed to 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.3, 35 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MESNA and 0.1 mM EDTA. The MtRpiB protein was cloned, overexpressed and purified as described previously15 with the addition of a final purification step by size-exclusion chromatography in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.3, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM -mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM EDTA. The protein was concentrated to 7.5­12 mg/mL, during which the NaCl concentration in the buffer was decreased to 35 mM. Kinetic assays A spectrophotometric assay described previously,23 in which the production of Ru5P is monitored as a change in absorbance at 290 nm, was used to characterize the EcRpiB H99N mutant and both wild-type Rpi's. Kinetic constants were estimated from linear regression using Hanes­Woolf plots. A spectrophotometric assay involving TBA was developed to test the conversion of All6P to Allu6P. The method29,30 was developed recently in one of our laboratories for the detection and quantification of Dfructose-6-phosphate.19 We found that TBA reacts similarly with Allu6P,31 which, following dehydration and dephosphorylation in the presence of hydrogen chloride, gives rise to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, which in turn reacts with TBA to yield the characteristic yellow adduct. The adduct absorbs strongly at 438 nm ( = 27,800 ± 100 M- 1 cm- 1). Under the same conditions, All6P32 produced a TBA adduct with an extinction coefficient of 690, 40 times

678
smaller than that for Allu6P. Therefore, a blank without enzyme was included to correct for the absorbance due to All6P. Typically, the assay mixture contained 50 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8­8 mM All6P and 5 mM MESNA, in a final volume of 1 mL. Following its preincubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 52 nM EcRpiB (5 L of a 0.165-mg/mL solution in buffer) or 316 nM MtRpiB (5 L of a 1.1-mg/mL solution). Precisely 2 min later (established to represent initial rate conditions), the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mL of concentrated HCl and 1 mL of 20 mM TBA solution (prepared fresh daily by dissolving 144.15 mg of TBA in 50 mL of concentrated HCl), yielding a total volume of 3 mL. After it was heated to 80 °C for 6 min, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature in an ice-water bath. After 3 h, the amount of Allu6P formed was estimated from the absorbance at 438 nm. Kinetic constants were estimated from linear regression using Hanes­Woolf plots. Each point reported is the average obtained from two to eight measurements. IC50 values of All6P and Allu6P against MtRpiB were measured using a constant R5P concentration of 2 mM. Crystallization, data collection, data processing and refinement MtRpiB and EcRpiB H99N were generally co-crystallized with the different compounds by vapor diffusion in hanging drops of 1-L protein and 1-L reservoir solution at 20 °C. Compound and protein solution were mixed together for 5­10 min prior to setting up the crystallization drops. MtRpiB (0.35 mM) together with 25 mM 5PRH crystallized in 15% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.1 M Mes, pH 6, 5% PEG 1000 and 0.2 M Li2SO4 and with 10 mM All6P in 1 M tri­Na citrate and 0.1 M Na cacodylate, pH 6.5. MtRpiB (0.22 mM) co-crystallized with R5P (2 mM) appeared in sitting drops in a Wizard 96-well crystallization screen (Emerald Biosystems) condition F6, 20% PEG 3K, 0.1 M Tris, pH 7, and 0.2 M Ca acetate. The EcRpiB mutant (0.24 mM) with 10 mM R5P was crystallized in 20% PEG 3350 and 0.1 M Mes, pH 6. For MtRpiB, needle-like crystals of dimensions 0.3 mm × 0.03 mm × 0.01 mm appeared after about 1 week, with slight improvements in size seen when the drops were streak seeded. EcRpiB H99N crystals grew in 2­3 days as chunky hexagonal plates of dimensions 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.03 mm. After crystals were transferred to a drop of a cryoprotectant (10% ethylene glycol, 10% glycerol, 80% well solution and 10 mM ligand), they were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Xray data were collected at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). All data were indexed with MOSFLM33 and processed in SCALA34 via the CCP4 interface.35 Information related to data collection is presented in Table 2. EcRpiB H99N was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe36 using the functional dimer of the original EcRpiB structure (PDB code 1NN4 with water molecules and histidine tag removed) as a search model. MtRpiB space group dimensions were in two cases similar enough for the five molecules in the original structure (PDB code 1USL with the water and phosphate ligands removed) to be placed by rigid-body refinement in Refmac5.37 The models were then subjected to restrained refinement, and the resulting maps were inspected for bound ligand density. Water molecules were placed after cycling with ARP/ wARP.38 R5P and 5PRA ligands of MtRpiB were placed with the ARP/wARP ligand tool,39 while others were placed manually in O.40 Rounds of rebuilding and refinement resulted in the final models described in Table 2.
