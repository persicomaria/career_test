Anisotropic behaviour of the C-terminal Kunitztype domain of the a3 chain of human type VI Ê collagen at atomic resolution (0.9 A)
The C-terminal Kunitz-type domain from the 3 chain of human type VI collagen (C5), a single amino-acid residue chain with three Ê disul®de bridges, was re®ned at 0.9 A resolution in a monoclinic form, space group P21 with one molecule per asymmetric unit, using data collected at cryogenic temperature (110 K). The average protein hBi Ê Ê factor decreases from 21 A2 at room temperature (RT) to 12 A2 at cryotemperature (100 K, CT). The spatially close N- and C-termini remain highly disordered. The different structural motifs of C5 were analyzed in terms of rigid-body displacement (TLS analyses) and show dominant libration motion for the secondary structure.

1. Introduction
The availability of low-temperature datarecording techniques is a way to experimentally analyze the dynamic motion of residues in proteins, compared with normal temperature experiments (Parkin et al., 1997; Harata et al., 1999; Wilson & Brunger, 2000; Teixeira et al., 2001). The C-terminal domain of human type VI collagen (3 chain), consisting of 58 aminoacid residues and named C5, has a BPTI-like structure and provides a good model. C5 diffracts to atomic resolution and allows anisotropic analyses of both local and overall motions of atoms or groups of atoms in the crystal matrix (Merigeau et al., 1998). The structure of a longer fragment of the 3 chain (76 residues) including the C5 domain has been solved in solution by the NMR technique (Zweckstetter et al., 1996) and is the origin of controversial results regarding the thermal behaviour of the central core (Sùrensen et al., 1997). The aim of the present study is to clarify some points about the thermal motion of C5 in the crystalline state, a study dif®cult to perform at room temperature (Arnoux et al., 1995).

Ê length of 0.900 A. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P21, with unit-cell paraÊ meters a = 25.24, b = 37.74, c = 28.49 A,  = 109.29 and Z = 2. The unit-cell parameters are slightly smaller than those recorded at 293 K. Crystal mosaicity was re®ned to 0.4 . A total of 179 075 observations in the resolution Ê range 8±0.9 A were reduced to 33 572 unique re¯ections. The merged data set contains 95.2% of the expected re¯ections in this resolution range (92.1% in the last shell). The overall Rmerge was 4.1% (34% in the highest resolution shell).

Puri®ed C5 protein was a gift from K. Norris (Novo Nordisk). Crystals were grown at 291 K as previously described (Merigeau et al., 1998), and soaked in 20% glycerol for cryocooling prior to X-ray exposure. A high-resolution Ê Ê (0.9 A) and a fast low-resolution (1.5 A) data set were collected at 110 K from a single crystal with 1 oscillation per frame at the BW7A synchrotron beamline, DESY, Hamburg. A MAR345 imaging plate was used at a wave-

An initial model was calculated using the Ê 1.2 A structure of C5 without water molecules (Arnoux et al., 1995; PDB code 2knt). The re®nement process started with a rigid-body Ê re®nement cycle with resolution limited to 2 A. The second step was composed of a series of slow-cooling steps re®ning positional paraÈ meters using X-PLOR/CNS (Brunger et al., Ê 1987, 1998) at a resolution of 1.8 A. In a third step, ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999) was used to localize 115 water molecules. Water peaks were selected according to their distances to hydrogen-bonding partners and were removed when the peak height in the 2Fo À Fc electron density was less than 0.7'. All water molecules were carefully inspected manually using TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 2001). An isotropic B-factor cutoff Ê of 35 A2 for solvent molecules was introduced to limit over®tting. Re®nement converged to R = 21.5% (Rfree = 26.1%). Electron densities which could include either sulfate or phosphate ions were localized in two places. Isotropic

re®nement continued with SHELX97. At the end of the ®rst cycle, R = 21.8% and Rfree = 24.5% (the same 6% of the data were used to calculate Rfree as were used in X-PLOR). In the next step, isotropic riding H atoms were introduced into the model, followed by individual anisotropic B factors. The structure was further re®ned by conjugategradient least-squares minimization using SHELX97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). Anisotropic B factors of protein atoms were restrained in the atom bond direction (DELU/SIMU commands). The anisotropic B factors of water molecules were not restrained. A few amino-acid residues showed clear alternate positions and were re®ned with the sum of their occupation factors constrained to unity. In the last steps, restraints on anisotropic factors were gradually relaxed so as not to bias the TLS analyses. The ®nal model includes four residues with alternate positions (Arg1 and Thr13, Ile18 in loop L1) unambiguously assigned, two phosphates and 91 water molecules. The ®nal model led to R = 12.1%, Rfree = 16.2% (Table 1).

phate was con®rmed based on the re®nement of a free parameter set to the XÐO distance (X = P for phosphate or S for Ê sulfate), where the expected value is 1.55 A Ê for PÐO or 1.42 A for SÐO. This parameter Ê converged to an average of 1.52 (2) A, corresponding to two phosphates, not sulfates. In solution, the RT structure of C5 solved by NMR (Zweckstetter et al., 1996) showed a highly mobile structure with at least 24 residues in multiple conformations. A second investigation made by Sùrensen et al. (1997) on the present shorter fragment (58 residues) concluded that the global fold was nearly identical to the crystal structure (Arnoux et al., 1995) recorded at room temperature. In the crystalline state at room temperature, C5 shows important dynamic motion, but only in the two N- and C-terminal extremities. At 110 K, the N- and C-terminal regions still remain highly ¯exible as is the case to a lesser extent for the three loops L1±L3. Fig. 1(a) shows the evolution of the average hBi factors of RT and CT re®nements. There is a systematic decrease in the hBi Ê factors of about 10 A2 between the RT and CT re®nements. This overall decrease is also evident from initial Wilson plots (hBiRT = 21.5 and Ê hBiCT = 11.9 A2).

the thermal Uij projections along a radial vector about the centre of mass (Urad are roughly constant, while Utang linearly increase). This is also evident from the RASMOL representation (Merritt & Bacon, 1997) shown in Fig. 1(b). The anisotropic Uij components were corrected from this rigidbody motion to derive residuals corresponding to the static disorder in the crystal. The corrected B factors are shown as a green line in Fig. 1(a). Obviously, the loops cannot be described as rigid blocks compared with the other structured parts of the molecule. A more accurate description of the vibration modes is obtained by dividing C5 into several individual groups: the two helices (H1, H2), the two strands (B1, B2) and the three loops (L1±L3). For each group, TLS parameters were determined and analyzed. As expected, the four

3. Results and discussion
Data recorded at 110 K (CT experiments) con®rmed the overall conformation of the C5 fragment at room temperature (RT). They also reveal the last residue to have a different orientation, showing a clear signature for its terminal carboxyl group. Both phosphate and sulfate ions were present in the crystallization medium. Two tetrahedral anions were located and phosActa Cryst. (2002). D58, 1252±1254

The inner core of C5 is rather rigid but the side chains at the surface presents a high degree of collective motion that was analyzed in terms of a manyrigid-body model. The TLS parameters (Schomaker & Trueblood, 1968; Winn et al., 2001) were derived using programs ANISOANL and TLSANL from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). A ®rst analysis was performed using the whole main chain as a single rigid group, removing from the calculations the three residues at both N- and C-termini. It was clear that the structure underwent a rigid-body motion as shown from the radial and tangential distributions of

The present analysis of the C5 fragment compares with the room-temperature NMR and X-ray dynamic data and also corroborates normal mode calculations (Merigeau et al., 1998). In addition, this study also shows that the Nand C-termini are mainly involved in local static disorder rather than in dynamic motion.
