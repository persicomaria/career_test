The Most Complex Pseudouridylase
In a recent issue of Molecular Cell, Rashid et al. (2006) report the crystal structure of a complex containing archaeal Cbf5, Nop10 and Gar1, critical components of box H/ACA RNPs. These RNPs constitute the most complex pseudouridylases yet discovered. Pseudouridine is a highly abundant posttranscriptional modification found in various RNAs of all organisms. It arises from an isomerization reaction whereby a uridine is converted to pseudouridine. Although pseudouridylation was discovered decades ago, only recently have the combined efforts of several laboratories yielded fruitful results describing the catalytic mechanism by which this modification occurs and the biological consequences thereof (Yu et al., 2005). We now know that pseudouridines in rRNAs and spliceosomal snRNAs play important roles in protein translation and premRNA splicing, respectively (King et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2005). There are five major pseudouridylase families, RluA, RsuA, TruA, TruB and TruD, which are responsible for pseudouridylation of various types of RNA (Kaya and Ofengand, 2003). Almost all of these pseudouridylases are single-polypeptide enzymes. The exceptions are the box H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs; also called sno/scaRNPs in eukaryotes for small nucleolar/Cajal body-specific ribonucleoproteins), a distinct group of pseudouridylases consisting of four core proteins (Cbf5, Nop10, Gar1, and Nhp2) and a small RNA that determines the site of pseudouridylation (reviewed in Yu et al., 2005). Box H/ACA RNPs pseudouridylate eukaryotic spliceosomal snRNAs and eukaryotic and archaeal rRNAs (Yu et al., 2005) and are regarded as members of the TruB family because their catalytic subunit, Cbf5 (dyskerin in mammals), has striking homology with TruB family proteins. Dyskerin is a mammalian Cbf5 homolog, mutations in which are directly linked to the skin and bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita (Meier, 2005). Cbf5 differs from other TruB pseudouridylases in that it requires association with a guide RNA and three more proteins to modify its substrate. The reason for this complexity remains unclear. Moreover, we do not yet understand how the components of box H/ACA RNPs communicate to yield pseudouridylase activity. Given the complexity of box H/ACA RNPs, it has been a challenge to study the assembly, structure, and function of this complex. Taking advantage of the fact that three of the box H/ACA RNP core proteins, Cbf5, Nop10, and Gar1, can form a complex in the absence of Nhp2 and guide RNA (Baker et al., 2005; Charpentier et al., 2005; Henras et al., 2004), Rashid et al. (2006) report a crystal structure of the archaeal Cbf5-Nop10-Gar1 triprotein complex. Notably, their structure includes an extra protein, Gar1, compared to excellent recently published work by

Ferre-D'Amare and colleagues, who crystallized the archaeal Cbf5-Nop10 heterodimer (Hamma et al., 2005). As expected, both studies demonstrate that Cbf5 adopts an overall structure similar to that of the E. coli pseudouridylase TruB (Hoang and Ferre-D'Amare, 2001). In particular, both Cbf5 and E. coli TruB share two major structural domains, namely the catalytic domain and the PUA (pseudouridine and archaeosine transglycosylase) domain, the latter of which is implicated in RNA substrate binding by E. coli TruB (Hoang and Ferre-D'Amare, 2001). However, the PUA domain in Cbf5 appears to have a slightly altered structure compared to that of E. coli TruB. The crystal structure also reveals that Nop10, a very small protein of w10 kDa, makes contacts along its full length to Cbf5, thereby forming an extensive interface between the two proteins. Nop10's small size and relatively extended structure suggests that it (and perhaps Cbf5 as well) may undergo a conformational change or structural stabilization upon binding. These changes may in turn facilitate the recognition/binding of the target RNA (Rashid et al., 2006). Gar1 contacts Cbf5 in regions well-separated from the Nop10 interaction surface that are likely critical for target RNA binding as well (Rashid et al., 2006). Thus, the structural data suggest that Nop10 and Gar1 bind independently to Cbf5, facilitating box H/ACA RNP assembly and RNA substrate binding (Rashid et al., 2006). Although the crystal structure was obtained using archaeal proteins, the sequences in the protein-protein contact regions are generally conserved across species, suggesting that the observed interactions may be preserved in eukaryotic box H/ACA sno/scaRNPs as well. Based on their own data and previous work, Rashid et al. (2006) construct a model for a complete box H/ACA RNP, capable of explaining most of the previous biochemical data related to the assembly and pseudouridylase function of this RNP (Baker et al., 2005; Charpentier et al., 2005; Henras et al., 2004; Wang and Meier, 2004). Remarkably, almost all of the mutations found in patients with dyskeratosis congenita are clustered in or near one face of the PUA domain of the disease-causing gene, dyskerin (Meier, 2005), further underscoring the importance of this RNA binding domain. What is equally exciting is that the crystal structure and the box H/ACA RNP model may help explain the long-standing question of why Cbf5 requires a guide RNA and three accessory proteins to pseudouridylate its RNA substrates. The answer has its basis in the intrinsic features of Cbf5 as well as in possible conformational changes that might occur upon binding of Cbf5 to its accessory proteins. For instance, some of the E. coli TruB regions that contact its tRNA substrate are missing in Cbf5. Consequently, CBf5 alone may not be able to efficiently bind to its substrate. Also, the PUA domain has an alternate configuration in Cbf5 when compared to the E. coli protein, thus potentially affecting its ability to recognize the RNA substrate on its own. Furthermore, the binding of the accessory proteins may induce local structural changes within Cbf5 that contribute to

substrate binding. Alternatively, as suggested by the complete box H/ACA RNP model (Rashid et al., 2006), multiple proteins in the complex may contribute to the RNA-protein interface. The crystal structure of the Cbf5-Nop10-Gar1 complex and the model of the box H/ACA RNP are, however, not consistent with every published biochemical result. For instance, archaeal L7Ae (a homolog of eukaryotic Nhp2) joins the complex by directly binding the guide RNA, whereas recruitment of eukaryotic Nhp2 to the complex appears to be mediated primarily by proteinprotein interactions between Nhp2 and Nop10 (Wang and Meier, 2004). The model provides little insight into these differences. Most strikingly, in vitro crosslinking experiments detected a contact between the nucleotide targeted for modification and eukaryotic Gar1 (Wang and Meier, 2004), but this contact seems impossible according to the model, as the target nucleotide is too distant to contact archaeal Gar1. It is possible that the inconsistencies simply reflect species-specific differences. In that regard, eukaryotic Gar1 contains extra N- and C-terminal domains compared with archaeal Gar1, and the extra domains may directly contact the target nucleotide. Alternatively, Gar1 may transiently contact the target nucleotide at some point during the reaction. Clearly, the proposed model not only raises some challenging questions, but also presents a number of predictions for further investigation. Thus, crystallization of the archaeal Cbf5-Nop10-Gar1 complex and con-

struction of the model of box H/ACA RNP represent extremely important steps toward a complete understanding of the function of this complex. Yi-Tao Yu Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics University of Rochester Medical Center Rochester, New York 14642

A Lock on Formins
Formin proteins control the dynamics of unbranched actin filaments and are regulated by intramolecular interactions. In this issue of Structure, Nezami et al. (2006) reveal the structure of a central component of the interaction that locks Diaphanous-related formins in the inactive state. Actin filaments play critical roles in many aspects of cell biology. In recent years, the formin family proteins, which are potent regulators of actin polymerization dynamics, have stirred ample excitement among many biologists. Their biological significance and the fact that formin family proteins contain multiple conserved domains with discrete biochemical properties have made formin proteins immediate targets for crystallographic analysis. In a flurry of discovery, several important structures have provided key insights into the molecular mechanism of formin function (Lammers et al., 2005; Otomo et al., 2005a, 2005b; Rose et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2004; Nezami et al., 2006). Formin proteins are defined by the presence of formin homology 2 (FH2) domains, the functional heart of formins, which nucleate new actin filaments and associate with the elongating barbed end of growing filaments

(Higgs, 2005; Zigmond, 2004). Among formin proteins, Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) contain conserved N-terminal regulatory domains and a C-terminal Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD). While the core DAD region is short (w25 residues), the N-terminal regulatory region contains contiguously a GTPase binding domain (GBD), a Diaphanous-inhibitory domain (DID), and a dimerization domain (DD). It has been shown that the interaction between the DID and DAD domains inhibits (thus ``locks'') the activity of the FH2 domain. The binding of specific Rho family GTPases (the ``key'') to GBD can relieve this autoinhibition by directly competing the DAD domain away from the DID domain (Li and Higgs, 2005; Rose et al., 2005). How does the lock work? Through structure determination by X-ray crystallography, Eck and coworkers now show that the DAD peptide of mDia1 forms an amphipathic helix and docks on the concave surface formed by the four armadillo repeats in the DID domain (Nezami et al., 2006). This interaction is mostly hydrophobic, which is consistent with the endothermic nature of the DID-DAD interaction (entropy-driven) (Nezami et al., 2006; Rose et al., 2005). The interface is also highly conserved among most DRFs, and thus the observed ``locked'' structure should be shared by other DRFs as well. These conclusions are consistent with recent work by Wittinghofer and coworkers (Lammers et al., 2005).
