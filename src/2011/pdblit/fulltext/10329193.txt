Abstract Homing endonucleases are classified into four families based on active site sequence motifs. Through structural comparisons we have found structural similarities between the endonuclease domain of colicin E9, an H-N-H motif-containing enzyme, and both the non-specific nuclease from Serratia and I-PpoI, a His-Cys box-containing homing endonuclease. Our comparison identifies conservation at the heart of all three enzyme active sites and so argues for a re-classification of H-NH and His-Cys box homing endonucleases as a single family. We suggest the `LLK-Me family' of homing enzymes to reflect the L three elements of secondary structure and the metal ion that define the motif. z 1999 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

DADG) [6]. As with the His-Cys box enzymes, the H-N-H endonuclease family is also composed of highly sequence speci¢c endonucleases such as I-TevIII as well as relatively nonspeci¢c enzymes such as the DNase colicins [6]. 2. Structural comparison of the active sites Although the overall fold of the three nucleases is di¡erent and there is no sequence homology, a stretch of 22 amino acids containing two L-strands and an K-helix that make up î their active sites superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.2 A for the main chain atoms of the E9 DNase domain with Iî PpoI and 1.5 A for the E9 DNase with the Serratia nuclease (Fig. 1b) (I-PpoI and Serratia nuclease superimpose with an î r.m.s.d. of 1.14 A as reported by Friedho¡ et al. [1]). This suggests that this conserved structural motif is highly e¡ective for DNA cleavage since it has evolved in three otherwise very di¡erent nucleases. In the centre of this LLK motif is a divalent metal ion located in the same position in all three nucleases. This is identi¢ed as Mg2 in I-PpoI and Serratia nuclease and Ni2 in the colicin E9 DNase structure (although the physiologically relevant ion in the E9 DNase is more likely to be Zn2 [5,7]). Interestingly, the identity of the metal ion is governed by conservative asparagine-for-histidine substitutions in the helix of the motif (Fig. 1c,d). Catalytically important residues seem to be conserved and displayed in a similar manner. For example, His-103 which co-ordinates a phosphate molecule in the E9 DNase is equivalent to His-98 and His-89 in I-PpoI and Serratia nuclease, respectively, where it is postulated to stabilise the negative charge on the pentaco-ordinate phosphate in the transition state for phosphodiester cleavage. Another conserved feature is an arginine, Arg-61 in I-PpoI, Arg57 in Serratia nuclease and Arg-5 in the E9 DNase. This residue points into the active site and co-ordinates either the inorganic phosphate in the E9 DNase structure or the phosphate backbone of bound DNA (in I-PpoI). This arginine has already been identi¢ed by mutational studies to be catalytically important in Serratia nuclease [1] and is conserved throughout the DNase-type colicins. Lastly, Asn-118 in the E9 DNase, the conserved asparagine of the H-N-H motif itself which is involved in forming stabilising hydrogen bonds within the active site (Fig. 1a), is conserved in Serratia nuclease (Asn-110). In I-PpoI it is substituted by a histidine residue (His-110) and is part of the His-Cys box co-ordinating a structural zinc atom.

1. Introduction Homing endonucleases are found in all three biological kingdoms encoded by genes within mobile, self-splicing introns and inteins. Structural similarities have recently been discussed for the active site regions of the highly sequence speci¢c homing endonuclease from Physarum polycephalum I-PpoI and the non-speci¢c endonuclease from Serratia marcescens, and a common catalytic mechanism has been proposed [1,2]. The structure of the T4 endonuclease VII probably also shares this active site motif [3]. Now the recently published structure of the colicin E9 DNase domain, in complex with its cognate immunity protein Im9 [4], identi¢es yet another endonuclease with the same fold at the active site. Colicin E9 and its homologue colicin E7 [5] were the ¢rst structures solved for the H-N-H motif found in homing endonucleases (Fig. 1a), enzymes previously classi¢ed into four families based on amino acid sequence motifs present in their active sites (H-N-H, His-Cys box, GIY-YIG and LAGLI-

Detailed views of the motif for E9 DNase (grey) overlaid with I-PpoI and with Serratia nuclease are shown in panels c and d, respectively. Important residues are highlighted and coloured according to panel b. The active site Ni2 ion (cyan) of the E9 DNase co-localises with the Mg2 ion (magenta) of both I-PpoI and Serratia. Light blue spheres in panel c show the positions of two structural zinc atoms in I-PpoI.

3. Rede¢ning homing endonuclease families Since the H-N-H motif-containing E9 DNase and I-PpoI, a His-Cys box enzyme, both display the same active site motif we suggest that the two families of homing endonucleases to which these enzymes belong should be rede¢ned on a structural basis as being one and the same. Our structural comparison indicates that the H-N-H motif of the E9 DNase and the His-Cys box of I-PpoI represent di¡erent ways of stabilising the same basic active site structure for a nuclease. We suggest the new name of the `LLK-Me family' of homing enzymes to re£ect the three elements of secondary structure and the metal ion that make up the core of their common active site fold.
