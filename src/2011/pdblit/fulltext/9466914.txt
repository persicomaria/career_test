Key words: Trypsin inhibitor; Serine proteinase inhibitor; Protein structure/function; (Erythrina)
Erythrina trypsin inhibitor (ETI) has good structural and sequence homology with soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI). However, STI does not inhibit tPA. From the three-dimensional structure of ETI it was known that the N-terminus of the molecule forms a finger-like structure stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the N-terminal finger region is located in close proximity to the reactive site loop and the N-terminal residue (Val) is bound up in the finger region. In STI the N-terminal region is located in close proximity to the reactive site loop and is folded into a structure similar to that in ETI. It was hypothesized that the N-terminal region is stabilized as in ETI and that the N-terminal residue of STI (Asp), because of its hydrophilic nature, is not involved in the structured N-terminal finger region of this protein. This leaves Aspl of STI free to form an ion pair with Lys60 of trypsin, when STI and trypsin interact. When amino acid sequences of trypsin and the C-terminus of tPA are aligned for optimum homology, it is seen that there are a number of insertion sequences in tPA that are thought to be accommodated in the form of protrusions. One of these can be seen to occur in the region that lies opposite the Lys60 region of trypsin. It is suggested in this work that the N-terminal Asp of STI and this protrusion of tPA sterically prevent the two proteins from approaching close enough for binding and inhibition to occur. A modified form of ETI was produced with an Asp residue N-terminal to Val to simulate the N-terminal region of STI. The active sites were titrated against trypsin and assayed against tPA. The results showed that the modified form of ETI had activity towards tPA similar to that of STI. This evidence indicates strongly that the N-terminal Asp of STI prevents its binding to and inhibiting tPA.

Introduction

Seeds of the genus Erythrina contain Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitors that are unusual in that, in addition to inhibiting trypsin and chymotrypsin, they also inhibit tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) [1,2]. O n e such inhibitor, isolated from E. caffra and referred to as Erythrina trypsin inhibitor (ETI), was found to have the highest specific t P A inhibitory activity in this group. O f particular importance to this work is the fact that E T I shows extensive sequence (Fig. 1) and structural h o m o l o g y with soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) [3], yet STI does not inhibit tPA. It was suggested to us by Dr. D. M a e d e r (unpublished data) that the reason for this difference between

E T I and STI may lie in the fact that STI has an N-terminal Asp residue that is not present in ETI. To test this hypothesis we have a d d e d an Asp residue to the N-terminus of E T I to make it similar to STI in this region, and we have noted the effects of this addition on the function of the protein. T h e N-terminal Asp was added by modifying the synthetic E T I - e n c o d i n g gene that we constructed previously [4].

Preparation of Asp-ETI
Expression of the fusion protein was induced as previously described [4] and the method of Marston [7] was used to prepare sphaeroplasts and to extract periplasmic proteins. The solution containing periplasmic proteins was adjusted to 80% saturation with ( N H 4 ) 2 S O 4 and centrifuged to recover the precipitated proteins. These were dissolved in a small volume of water and dialyzed against several changes of water for 24 h during which time a large amount of contaminating protein precipitated. The remaining solution was lyophilized and redissolved in a minimum volume of 0.9% NaC1. A Ser-Met dipeptide remains at the N-terminus of Asp-ETI after the OmpT signal sequence has been cleaved on export to the periplasm. This dipeptide was

Assays for trypsin and tPA inhibiting actiuity
The concentrations of the inhibitors used in the functional assays were determined by the biuret reaction to give /zmol p r o t e i n / m l , and by the method of Chase and Shaw [8] to give ~mol of active sites/ml. The results are shown in Table II. Proteinase inhibitory assays were performed according to the method described by Heussen-Schemmer and Dowdle [9]. The results of these assays are shown in Table III.

The three-dimensional structure of ETI [10] can be described as a roughly cone-shaped barrel stabilized by two disulphide bridges (Cys39-Cys83 and Cys132Cys139). A short segment bearing the C-terminus, the active site loop (residues 61 to 67) and the N-terminal loop protrude from the narrow end of the barrel. The

active-site loop contains the reactive site Arg63-Ser64 through which ETI interacts with both trypsin and tPA [4,11]. In addition, residues 65 to 67 of the active site loop are involved in hydrogen bonding with residues 1 to 4 and 8 to 12. Through these interactions the Nterminus of ETI folds back on itself forming and stabilizing a finger-like structure. This N-terminal finger has been modelled by Onesti et al. [10] (Fig. 2). From this it can be seen that a number of hydrophobic residues (Vail, Leu2, Leu3, Val9, Vall0, Ala65, Phe66, Pro67, Ile68) are also involved and that hydrophobic interactions between them add to the stability of the N-terminal structure. The N-terminal finger of ETI is thus fixed to the reactive site loop and rendered immobile relative to it. In ETI-proteinase complexes, therefore, the N-terminal finger is positioned close to the proteinase. The structure of STI in complex with porcine trypsin has been determined [12]. It too has a barrel-like structure stabilized by two disulphide bridges (Cys39Cys86 and Cys138-Cys145). The region that interacts with trypsin is found on a curved loop of residues 61 to 66, which protrudes from the core of the inhibitor and contains the active site Arg63 and scissile bond Arg63I1e64. The carbonyl group of Aspl of STI forms an ion pair with the e-amino group of Lys60 of trypsin when these two molecules interact. This is the only ion-pair interaction between STI and trypsin outside the primary binding site.

26 B a s e d on t h e s e descriptions, a n d the d e g r e e of a m i n o acid h o m o l o g y b e t w e e n the two inhibitors, it is clear that STI has a t o p o l o g y very similar to that of ETI.

It can be seen that the N - t e r m i n u s o f STI is arr a n g e d into a finger-like s t r u c t u r e similar to that of ETI (Fig. 3a). T h e STI m o d e l is not of sufficient quality to allow an analysis o f s e c o n d a r y s t r u c t u r e e l e m e n t s in t e r m s of h y d r o g e n bonds. However, it can be seen that the two N - t e r m i n a l regions follow each o t h e r closely (Fig. 3b) and that the N - t e r m i n u s of STI is a r e s i d u e l o n g e r t h a n that of E T I , as might be e x p e c t e d from the s e q u e n c e a l i g n m e n t a n d the d e g r e e o f h o m o l o g y in this region (Fig. 1). F u r t h e r m o r e , w h e r e the s e q u e n c e o f the E T I a n d STI N - t e r m i n a l finger regions are not h o m o l o g o u s , t h e r e has b e e n a conservation of the h y d r o p h o b i c a n d hydrophilic residues.

of inhibitors of the STI-Kunitz family, such as ETI and STI, have a fiat shape that fits into the active-site cleft of their cognate serine proteinases [13]. For proteinase activity to be inhibited, the scissile bond at the reactive site of the inhibitor must be positioned over the catalytic site of the enzyme, close enough for a stable enzyme:inhibitor complex to form. Thus the two molecules have to approach very closely in order for inhibition to occur. While both ETI and STI inhibit trypsin, certain fundamental differences between trypsin and tPA, to be discussed later, prevent close enough contact between STI and tPA for inhibition to
occur.

The B-chain of human c~-thrombin is homologous to chymotrypsin and trypsin. Thrombin cleaves similarly to trypsin, C-terminal to basic amino acid residues, but thrombin is much more specific and cleaves fewer bonds in macromolecular substrates. Comparisons of the crystallographic structures of trypsin, chymotrypsin and thrombin have shown that the specificity of thrombin for macromolecular substrates is mainly determined by its insertions. Some of these result in a narrower and deeper active site cleft in thrombin in comparison with that of chymotrypsin and trypsin, while others prevent its inhibition by proteinase inhibitors that inhibit trypsin a n d / o r chymotrypsin [14]. While there is currently no crystal structure available for tPA, its C-terminal domain (residues 260 to 527) is homologous with a number of serine proteinases of known structure [10]. The amino acid sequences of a portion of the C-terminal domain of tPA and the Lys60 region of trypsin were aligned (Fig. 4). A similar alignment was done with chymotrypsin and tPA (not shown). The insertion of five amino acids between residues 62 and 63 (trypsin numbering) in tPA, is thought to be accommodated by a protrusion in this area. We reasoned that Aspl of STI is not included in the structure of the N-terminal finger because its hydrophilic side chain is excluded from the area of hydrophobic interactions between Phe2, Phe66, Ile67 and perhaps Ala68. This leaves Aspl of STI protruding into the space between the reactive site loop and the N-terminal finger region allowing its carboxyl group to form an ion pair with Lys60 of trypsin.

The N-terminal Val of ETI, on the other hand, being more hydrophobic than the Aspl of STI, is incorporated in the ETI N-terminal finger region. Thus, when ETI forms a stable inhibitory complex with tPA, its Vall has neither the proximity nor the side chain group to ion pair with Lys60 of trypsin. The fact that the strength of inhibition of trypsin by STI and ETI is of the same order of magnitude indicates that ETI does not require the ion-pair interaction in this region to inhibit trypsin. In the case of STI, it is possible that the ion pair formed between itself and trypsin is essential to the stability of the inhibition complex. We believe that this hypothesized protrusion in tPA clashes with Asp1 of STI preventing it sterically from approaching close enough to tPA to form an S T I : t P A inhibitory complex. As ETI has one less residue in its N-terminal finger region than STI, it is able to approach close enough to complex with tPA. We used the synthetic ETI-encoding gene described by Teixeira et al. [4] to examine this hypothesis by adding an Asp residue to the N-terminus of ETI to simulate STI in terms of N-terminal length and polarity. The results shown in Table I indicate that the strategy adopted has been successful in producing a form of ETI that is modified by extension of the N-terminus with an Asp residue. Titration of the active sites in the preparation of Asp-ETI, as shown in Table II, indicates that some 12-15% activity has been lost in comparison with the activities of a preparation of natural ETI (kindly supplied by Technifin) and STI respectively. This was to be expected as the protein had been subjected to harsh treatment in purification and CNBr cleavage. It has previously been shown that ETI of the same sequence as that of natural ETI is produced from the synthetic ETI gene, and the latter is indistinguishable from purified natural ETI in its ability to inhibit both trypsin and tPA [4]. Conversely, Asp-ETI, based on the specific inhibitory activity values shown in Table III, behaves like STI towards trypsin and tPA. The specific inhibitory results for Asp-ETI displayed in Table II indicate that the Aspl residue of this ETI variant is not incorporated in the finger-like structure of this molecule and interferes with its ability to inhibit
