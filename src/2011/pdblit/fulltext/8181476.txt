The solution structure of the human plasminogen kringle 1 domain complexed to the antifibrinolytic drug 6-aminohexanoic acid (EAhx) was obtained on the basis of 'H-NMR spectroscopic data and dynamical simulated annealing calculations. Two sets of structures were derived starting from (a) random coil conformations and (b) the (mutated) crystallographic structure of the homologous prothrombin kringle 1. The two sets display essentially the same backbone folding (painvise rootmean-square deviation, 0.15 nm) indicating that, regardless of the initial structure, the data is sufficient to locate a conformation corresponding to an essentially unique energy minimum. The conformations of residues connected to prolines were localized to energetically preferred regions of the Ramachandran map. The Pro30 peptide bond is proposed to be cis. The ligand-binding site of the kringle 1 is a shallow cavity composed of Pro33, Phe36, Trp62, Tyr64, Tyr72 and Tyr74. Doubly charged anionic and cationic centers configured by the side chains of Asp55 and Asp57, and Arg34 and Arg71, respectively, contribute to anchoring the zwitterionic eAhx molecule at the binding site. The ligand exhibits closer contacts with the kringle anionic centers (-0.35 nm average O . . . H distance between the Asp55IAsp57 carboxylate and ligand amino groups) than with the cationic ones ( ~ 0 . 5 nm closest 0 . .. H distances between the ligand carboxylate and the Arg34/Arg71 guanidino 2 groups). The EAhx hydrocarbon chain rests flanked by Pro33, 51-64, Tyr72 and Tyr74 on one side and Phe36 on the other. Dipolar (Overhauser) connectivities indicate that the ligand aliphatic moiety establishes close contacts with the Phe36 and Trp62 aromatic rings. The computed structure suggests that the EAhx molecule adopts a kinked conformation when complexed to knngle 1, effectively shortening its dipole length to -0.65 nm.

'H-NMR studies have revealed a close conformational relatedness among the plasminogen (Pgn) heavy chain kringle 1 (Kl), K4 and K5 modules [l-31. The latter includes characteristic features of secondary structure [4]. Despite this spectroscopically recognizable uniformity in their gross folding characteristics, ligand-binding and selective 'H-NMR Overhauser experiments have suggested that the binding site of K1 differs from the one in K4 in that the aromatic residue at site 36 (Phe36) establishes close contact with the ligand [ 5 ] . This interaction may compensate for the Trp72+Tyr substitution on going from K4 to K1, as Trp72 integrity is fundamental for ligand binding to K4 [6]. Chemical modification experiments have also shown that integrity of Arg32 and Arg34 is required for the binding of fibrin and lysine to K1 [7]. Despite these earlier studies, little is known

of the K1 structure such that, to this date, only approximate models based on limited NMR data and the assumed structural similarity to the prothrombin kringle 1 (PtbfKl), whose crystallographic structure is known [8], have been reported [5, 91. This prompted us to attempt solving the complete solution structure of the PgdK1 domain. In the preceding paper we describe the assignment of the K l 'H-NMR spectrum and derive its secondary structure [4]. Here, we report on a 'H-NMR structural characterization of the PgdK1 complex with eaminohexanoic acid (EAhx) in solution. Global features of the PgnlKl folding as well as of the lysine-binding site structure are discussed.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Sample preparation The K1 sample was the same as that described in the preceding paper [4]. For the NMR experiments, K1 was dissolved in 0.4ml of either "H,O (MSD Isotopes) or 'H,O/ 'H,O (9 : 1, by vol.) to a final concentration of -2 mM in the presence of 2-3-fold molar excess of EAhx, 0.02% (mass/ vol.)

NOESY spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode via time-proportional phase incrementation. Mixing times (tJ were 50, 100, 200 and 300 ms. NOESY experiments involved 512 t, increments (64-80 scanslincrement) of 4096 data points each.

HN hydrogen bonds were introduced between residues 14/22, 161 20, 16/19, 52/62, 61/75, and 65/71 within the /3-sheet regions as predicted from the secondary structure [4]. NOEs are summarized in Fig. 1. In addition to the above, non-NOES, or anti-distance constraints (ADCs) [22], were incorporated at a later stage of the structure calculations. The use of ADCs is based on the premise that if an NOE between two protons is missing from the NOESY spectrum, then the distance between them is likely to be greater than 0.4 nm [22-241. Hence, at a suitable stage of the structure computation (see below), interproton distances < 0.30 nm involving non-exchangeable and non-methyl protons which did not correspond to observable NOEs were converted to ADCs by assigning lower and upper distance bounds of 0.3.5 nm and 1.0 nm, respectively, to the ad hoc NOE force field.

restraints. Four stereospecific assignments of the prochiral C m H ' protons were deduced (Table 1) taking into account 3JH,.Hp splittings and the relative intensities of intra-residue CaH-CmH' and NH-CmH' NOEs [15, 161.

Structure calculations
Three-dimensional structures were generated through restrained dynamical simulated annealing simulations [25 -281 using the program X-PLOR [29]. The force constants for bond, angle and improper terms were set to 251 kJ (600 kcal) . mol-' . nm ' 2090k.I (500kcal) . mol-' . rad-' and , J 2508 k (600 kcal) . mo1P . Tadp2to ensure near perfect stereochemistry throughout the calculations [29, 301. A soft repulsion energy term [25, 301 was applied to prevent unduly close non-bonded contacts. The NOE restraints were modeled by either a square-well [31] or soft square-well potential [25]. The torsional force potential was modeled via a squarewell potential [13] with a force constant of 836 kJ (200 kcal) . molp' . For the structure search, the protocol we followed [28] is essentially the one we have applied previously to calculate the solution structure of the tPA/K2 [32]. As a final step, all structures were subjected to 1000 steps of Powell minimization incorporating the Lennard-Jones and coulombic electrostatic (with distance-dependent dielectric constant) potentials to account for nonbonding interactions. To calculate the structure of the K1-eAhx complex, the ligand was manually docked at the binding site of the (energy-minimized) average structure R. The amino group of the ligand was positioned close to the side chains of Asp55 and Asp57, with its hydrocarbon chain lying across the surface of the Trp62 indole ring. The complex was then subjected to Powell restrained energy minimization until convergence [energy gradient < 4.18 W (1 kcal)/mol]. All intermolecular and intramolecular distance constraints (7 and

Interproton distance restraints
Approximately 960 NOEs were assigned from NOESY spectra recorded with t,,, = 200 ms. Identities of weak crosspeaks were verified from a t, = 300 ms NOESY spectrum. Upper bound distance constraints were derived from the NOE peak volumes in t,,,= 5 0ms NOESY spectra. The NOEs were calibrated assuming a,J rg6, where a,, is the cross-peak intensity and r,, the corresponding distance separating protons i an dj. The r, values were scaled based on the known intraresidue distances separating Trp and His ring protons and Asn and Gln side-chain geminal protons. Intraresidue NH-CaHICaH-C/3H and sequential CaH,-NH,,, distances [17] were also considered. It was observed that the least intense cross-peaks in the t , = 200 ms NOESY spectrum arise from distances of ~ 0 . nm. This calibration 4 yielded computed distances which differed from the experimental ones within ? 12%. As a safeguard against motional averaging effects [18, 191, a margin of 20% was added to the calculated distances to establish upper bounds. Cross-peaks observed at t, = 200 ms but not at t, = 50 ms or 100 ms were assigned an upper bound of 0.6 nm. Upper limits for distances involving non-stereospecifically assigned and equivalent protons were corrected for center-averaging [20]. An extra 0.05 nm was added to the upper limit for distances involving methyl protons [13, 211. A total of 588 distance restraints were used for the structure calculations. These in-

The resulting structure is denoted RE,, Subsequently, an additional 1000 cycles of Powell minimization was carried out on the complex, omitting the ADCs and the electrostatic forces. This structure is named RsZ. Both structures satisfy the experimental distance restraints within cO.01 nm and exhibit relatively small deviations from the initial structure [0.058 nm and 0.108 nm, backbone and allatom root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) to initial structure, respectively]. Computations were carried out either on a Silicon Graphics Personal Iris 4D/35 workstation or on the Cray Y-MP machine of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Structures were visualized on the Iris 4D/35 screen with the program Moll7 [33] or QUANTA (Polygen Inc.). Fig. 5 was created with the program Molscript [34].

RESULTS Computed structures
The K1 COSY spectrum shows a relatively weak Thr28 NH-CaH cross-peak and only few long-range NOEs were detected for the peptide stretch Thr28-Ser29-Pro30 (Fig. l), suggesting local segmental flexibility. Indeed, the duN(i,i+ 1) sequential connectivities for Ser27 -Pro30 were not observed [4], limitting our ability to determine the conformation of the Ser29-Pro30 peptide bond. Test calculations constraining the Ser29-Pro30 amide to a cis conformation were found to converge more rapidly, with van der Waals and electrostatic energies that were significantly lower, relative to those incorporating a trans amide. The structures were selected based on negative van der Waals and electrostatic energies and satisfactory agreement with experimental distance restraints. A cis peptide bond linking the dipeptide segment Ser29-Pro30 concurs with what has been observed crystallographically for the PgdK4 Thr29-Pro30 amide [35]. Two sets of converged structures (12/set) were calculated for PgdK1. For the first set, 55 random structures excluding disulfide bridges were subjected to simulated annealing [25, 271, all under the constraint of a cis conformation for the Thr29-Pro30 amide; 47 structures were obtained which had negative van der Waals and electrostatic energies. They were then subjected to another round of simulated annealing (22.7 ps, 600 K) incorporating the disulfide bond restraints. The twelve structures with the lowest van der Waals and electrostatic energies also exhibited the highest relative precision (0.15? 0.04 nm backbone atomic RMSD from the

mean) and agreed well with the experimental restraints (RMSD = 0.0091 2 0.0006 nm). The interproton distance matrix was calculated and ADCs were incorporated as described under Experimental Procedures, to yield the set { R) containing structures whose backbone atomic RMSD from the mean is 0.13 ? 0.02 nm. In a parallel calculation, a model based on the X-ray crystallographic structure of Ptb/K1 [S] was the starting point. The Ptb/Kl structure was first mutated to the sequence of the PgdK1 and subsequently subjected to adopted-basis Newton-Raphson unrestrained energy minimization, as described [36]. Using different initial velocities, 27 structures were calculated of which 12 were selected based on good (negative) van der Waals and electrostatic energies. As with the (R} set, ADCs were found to improve the precision of the structures, yielding 0.13 -+ 0.03 nm and 0.11 -+ 0.02 nm RMSD from the mean before and after incorporation of ADCs, respectively. The resulting set of structures is denoted as { X}. Statistics for the { R} and { X) structures are summarized in Table 2. Clearly, the incorporation of ADCs significantly expedites finding `best' sets of final structures.

The diagram shows a frontal view of the ligand-binding site: (A) (R]structures; (B) (X) structures. An asterisk by the lower left loop indicates the location of Pro30, postulated to be cis. N and C denote the aminoand carboxy-termini, respectively.

Both the { R) and { X} structures exhibit very small deviations from idealized covalent geometry and satisfy the experimental distance restraints reasonably well (Table 3). Backbone superpositions of the two sets of structures are shown in Fig. 2. An average structure was calculated for each set and subjected to 1800 steps of steepest descent unrestrained energy minimization followed by 1000 steps of restrained Powell minimization in order to correct poor stereochemistry

and unfavorable non-bonding contacts using the programs CHARMM and XPLOR, respectively. The energy-minimized mean structures are designated (R) and (X). In a final step, the mean structures were energy-minimized omitting the ADCs, yielding structures R and X. The good agreement between the structures R and X (0.15 nm and 0.19 nm, backbone and all-atom RMSDs, respectively) indicate that the NMR data suffices to locate what is basically the same target structure regardless of the initial conformation although, as expected, convergence is more rapid when starting from the homologous structure. It is worth noting that the RMSD between structures (R) and (X) is smaller when residues 1- 11 are excluded (Table 2). This peptide stretch consistently exhibits a relatively lower precision in both families of structures (Figs 2 and 3). Considering that in all the investigated kringle homologs the region around Tyr9 exhibits multiple conformations that interconvert at an intermediate rate on the NMR timescale [4, 5 , 37-41], the relatively high structural disorder within the 1- 11 stretch (Fig. 2) is not unexpected. A similarly poor definition for this segment was previously found in the NMR solution structures of horse PgdK4 [38], tPA/ K2 [32] and, more recently, the uPA/K [42,43]. Fig. 3 shows the atomic RJMSD values for the {R} and {X) families about the R and X structures, respectively. Not surprisingly, the backbone conformation of residues 1 - 11 appears to be better defined in the {X} structures relative to the {R) set (Fig. 2) and, overall, the RMSD values are lower for the { X} relative to the {R) set except for Thr28. The unusually large variations in the segment surrounding Pro30 in the (X} structures (Fig. 3B) may result from the fact that in the initial structure, based on the crystallographic Ptb/Kl, the Ser29-Pro30 bond is trans [8]. Segments of the protein involved in anti-parallel P-sheets generally exhibit relatively low RMSD values (Fig. 3). These are the stretches Serl4-LyslS-Thrl6, Gly19-Ile20-Thr21Cys22, ArgS2-AsnS3 and Pro61 -Tyr74. This reflects the relatively large number of interresidue NOEs constraining these residues (Fig. 1).

Conformational analysis The Ramachandran CJ/Y map of the R structure is shown in Fig. 4. The plot shows that over 90% of the kringle 1 residues lie within the allowed CJ and Y backbone dihedral angle regions or within the bridging region [44]. As ex-

pected, the aLupper right quadrant region of the PgdK1 @/ Y map is occupied by Gly (sites 4, 6, 19, and 61) and Asn (site 56) residues. Serl4 and His31 were also found to be in the aL conformation, a rather rare occurrence. In the case of His31, it occurs within a Pro-Xaa-Yaa-Pro sequence, which is known to severely constrain the Xaa and Yaa residues, thus often yielding unusual backbone conformations [45]. It is interesting to note that Pro residues represent a somewhat larger fraction of the PgdK1 sequence (10%) relative to the PgdK4 (7.5%) and tPMK2 (6.1%) sequences. Seven out of eight Pro residues are in the right-handed ahelical or aR (@ = -60", Y = -40") conformation, with only Pro61 in the upper left, P-region quadrant of the Ramachandran plot [45]. Also, the conformational space of a residue preceding a proline is usually restricted to the ,&region of the Ramachandran plot [45]. In PgdK1, five out of the eight residues preceding a proline (63 %) are found in the P-region with two of the three remaining residues lying outside the four major regions of the @/Ymap. The one Pro postulated to be cis (site 30) is preceded by a Ser residue.

Consistent with previous observations on Ptb/K1 [8], tPA/K2 [32, 461 and PgnlK4 [35, 381, the Pgnl K1 Cys22-Cys63 and Cys51-Cys73 disulfide bonds are positioned close ( ~ 0 . nm) and relatively perpendicular to each 4 other. This was recognized earlier as a key feature of the kringle fold [8].

Main-chain H bonds
Table 5 lists H bonds suggested by the a structure. H bonds which are located in 8-sheet and reverse turn (T) segments as well as corresponding H bonds in the Pgn/K4 [35] and tPA/K2 [32] are indicated. Only the backbone-backbone H bonds bridging Serl4 to Cys22, Thrl6 to Ile20, Trp62 to Arg52 and Cys63 to Asp73, which had been predicted from the analysis of sequential and medium-range Overhauser connectivities [4], were included as distance constraints in the calculations. Two bifurcated H bonds involving main-chain atoms are suggested: Gly4 C'O is within H-bonding distance to both the Gly6 NH and Lys7 NH, and the Thrl6 C'O could interact with both Ile20 and Gly19 NH.

OyH to H bond the Lys70 C'O. Two H bonds, involving Trp25 NH1 and Thr65 OyH, were suggested by their retarded H-D exchange rates. In case of the latter, this was supported by the occurrence of a Cm-OyH COSY cross-peak [4]. Similarly, the observation of COSY cross-peaks corresponding to the Arg32, Arg52 and Arg71 side-chain CGH-NeH connectivities [4] suggests that they too may participate in H bonds. Only the H bond involving the Arg32 NEH to Ser27 C'O is indicated by the structure (Table 6). Near the N-terminus, two H bonds involving both the backbone and side chain of Tyr9 are suggested (Table 6). These H bonds may contribute to stabilizing the small hydrophobic cluster formed by Tyr9, Ile77 and Leu78. However, as discussed above, the flexibility around the Tyr9 locus (Figs2 and 3) cautions against a detailed interpretation.

Sequence comparisons [47], chemical modification [7, 48, 491, NMR spectroscopic [5, 501, structural modeling [9], and mutagenesis [51, 521 studies have led to identifying the anionic aspartyl side chains at positions 55 and 57 and counterpart cationic (Arg or Lys) centers variously distributed at sites 33, 34, 36, 69 andlor 71, as focal points of an electrostatic field that interacts with lysine-type zwitterionic ligands while docking at the binding site of the various kringles. The reported structures of the Ptb/Kl [8], Pgn/K4 [35, 38, 551 and tPA/K2 [32, 461 lend support to this model. Although the NOE data for Pgn/Kl was collected for the module in the presence of the ligand EAhx, the { R] and { X) structures were computed without explicitly including the ligand in the calculations. In fact, seven magnetization transfer NOESY cross-peaks were assigned to dipolar connectivities between eAhx and Phe36 and Trp62, yielding seven intermolecular distance constraints. This evidence, combined with the postulated contact of Asp55 and Asp57 with the ligand

Side-chain H bonds and ion pairs
A number of H bonds involving amino acid side chains are indicated (Table 6). The H bonds connecting Lysl7 NH to Asp73 061 and Lys70 N m to Thr21 C'O establish the proximity of the two /?-sheets in PgnlKl (Fig. 5), as revealed by Overhauser connectivities [4]. An ion pair between the polar groups of Lysl5 and Asp76 may further stabilize the contacts between the two P-sheets. As indicated in Fig. 5 , the two 8-sheets cross each other at an angle of about 90". Additionally, the Trp25 NH1 is H-bonded to the Glu47 C60. Thr65 Oy forms a bifurcated H bond with Asp67 NH and Lys70 NCH; it also serves as a donor by allowing its own

&-aminogroup enabled us to localize the ligand-binding site within the structure. Fig. 6 shows side-chain locations within the binding site area, as a superposition of the 12 { R} structures. An exposed hydrophobic trough is formed by the Pro33, Phe36, Trp62, Tyr64, Tyr72 and Tyr74 side chains, capped by the anionic side chains of Asp55 and Asp57 at the upper end and, in opposition, the cationic side chains of Arg34 and Arg7l. The Trp62 indole ring spans much of the space between the ionic centers, with its C5-C6 edge oriented towards the Pro33 CaC6 ring edge. The Nl-C2 edge of the Trp62 ring is adjacent ( ~ 0 . nm) to the Asp55 carboxylate group, its NH1 proton 4 lying about 0.4 nm from Asp55 062. This is consistent with the observation that the Trp62 indole spectrum acidhase titrates with pK, = 3.8 [2]. As enforced by the NOE constraints (Fig. l), the Phe36 ring edge lies proximal to the N1, C6, C7 edge of the Trp62 ring. It is apparent (Fig. 6) that the positions of the Arg34 and Arg71 cationic groups are poorly defined, reflecting the fact that these residues yield sparse NOEs. Although the steric orientations of the Arg34 and Arg71 side chains are largely restricted by the Pro33 and

Phe64 rings, respectively, both side chains have the potential of pointing towards the lysine-binding site or outwards, into the solvent, by simple rotations about the Cp-Cy bond. Fig. 7 shows space-filling models of PgdK1 without (A) and with (B) the ligand EAhx (yellow). In the presence of the ligand, the anionic loci of Asp55 and Asp57 lie ~ 0 . nm 5 apart while a distance of ~ 0 . nm separates the guanidino 9 NrHZgroups of Arg34 and Arg71. The side chain of Arg34 assumes a position such that one NrH: group is =1 nm from 1 the Asp55 CyO. Similarly, a distance of ~ 1 .nm separates the charged centers of Asp57 and Arg71. The amino group of the ligand is shown anchored at ~ 0 . 3 nm from the car5 boxylate groups of Asp55 and Asp57. The ligand carboxylate group displays somewhat more distant ionic contacts than does the amino group, becoming situated ~ 0 . 7 nm and 4 ~ 0 . 6 nm (average C = O...HN distances) from the cat0 ionic centers of the Arg34 and Arg71 sidechains, respectively. Interestingly, the Tyr64 phenolic OH is within hydrogenbonding distance ( ~ 0 . 2 nm) of the ligand carboxylate 4 group. While docked at the K1 binding site, EAhx assumes a kinked conformation (Fig. 7B). Thus, the backbone is not fully extended, resulting in a dipole distance of ~ 0 . 6 nm. 5 Fig. 8 shows the hydrophobic ligand-kringle contact surface (green) superimposed on the ribbon outline of the K1 backbone. The ligand (EAhx) is denoted by a stick model (yellow). The eAhx Ca is close to the Tyr64 ( ~ 0 . nm) and 4 Phe36 ( ~ 0 . nm) aromatic rings. Contacting the central (Cp, 5 Cy) portion of the ligand is the Trp62 indole group. The indole C4 and C5 are located ~ 0 . nm and ~ 0 . nm from 4 6 the EAhx Cp and Cy atoms, respectively. The structural arrangement of the hydrophobic groups at the lysine-binding site suggests that the ligand places itself in a skewed orientation relative to the trough axis (Fig. 8). A similar arrangement was observed for the ligand 4-(aminomethy1)bicyclo [2,2,2]octane-1-carboxylic acid, a rigid bicyclic analog [53]. Contiguous to the binding site and buried within the kringle globule is a hydrophobic cluster involving Leu46. Numerous NOEs link the Leu46 side chain to Pro33, Phe36 and Trp62 at the lysine-binding site. Consistent with the Overhauser data, the structure places a Leu46 CdH, group

DISCUSSION
Out of 19 main-chain H bonds in Pgn/KI, 10 were identified at equivalent positions in Pgn/K4 and 9 in tPNK2

(Table 5). They all occur within P-sheet regions (residues 16-20 and 62-75) except for the one between the Tyr50 NH and the Glu47 C'O (Thr47 in Pgn/K4 [35] and His48a in tPNK2 [54]). Interestingly, the backbone-backbone NH...O = C bridge between Gly19 and Thrl6, which supports the type I turn linking the first pair of P-strands (segments 14-16 and 20-22) in Pgn/Kl and K4, becomes a backbone-side-chain H bond between Gly19 NH and Thrl6 Oy in tPA/K2 [32], despite a high degree of sequence identity in this area. Similarly, a H bond bridges Tyr5O and Trp25 in all three kringles, although the donors and acceptors differ among the homologs (Table 6). Occasionally, H-bonding residues vary slightly in position from one kringle to another (Table 5 ) , with the H bonds involving residues 1- 11 exhibiting the greater variability (Tables 5 and 6). The latter may reflect the segmental flexibility characterizing the polypeptide stretch encompassing Tyr9. The approximate orthogonal positioning of the two 6sheets (Fig. 5) is a conserved feature first observed in the bovine Ptb/Kl 181 and subsequently in Pgn/K4 135, 37, 381 and tPA/K2 [32,46]. The contact between Lysl7 and Asp73 in PgnfKl corresponds to the Thrl6 OyH . . . 0 ~ Glu73 and 1 Glu17 NH . . .OC Tyr74 H bonds in Pgn/K4 and tPA/K2, respectively. The suggested ion pairing between sites 15 and 76 in Pgn/K1 (Table 5) is not found in Pgn/K4 and tPA/K2 since in these homologs the residues at site 15 are not basic. Instead, H bond contact between the two residues is maintained via a backbone -backbone NH . . . O = C bridge (Table 5).
