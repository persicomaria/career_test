The Crystal Structure of Escherichia coli MoeA and Its Relationship to the Multifunctional Protein Gephyrin
Song Xiang, Jason Nichols, K. V. Rajagopalan, and Hermann Schindelin*§ * Department of Biochemistry and Center for Structural Biology  Department of Physiology and Biophysics State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook, New York 11794  Department of Biochemistry Duke University Medical Center Durham, North Carolina 27710 In humans, deficiencies in enzymes involved in Moco biosynthesis [4­6], (K. V. R. et al., unpublished data) lead to Moco deficiency and result in death shortly after birth. The affected patients show neurological abnormalities such as attenuated growth of the brain, untreatable seizures, and, often, dislocated ocular lenses. The pathology of Moco deficiency is very similar to that seen with isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency [7]. Sulfite oxidase is one of three known Moco-containing enzymes in humans, and, together, Moco deficiency and sulfite oxidase deficiency have been diagnosed in more than 100 individuals worldwide [8]. The mammalian protein gephyrin [9] was initially identified as being responsible for the postsynaptic anchoring of inhibitory glycine receptors to the cytoskeleton, associating with both the subunit of the receptor and tubulin [10, 11]. Gephyrin also interacts directly with the actin binding protein profilin [12] and appears to be involved in the postsynaptic localization of major GABAA receptor subtypes [13], although a direct interaction with these receptors has not been demonstrated. Gephyrin was also shown to interact with the DNA-activating protein kinase RAFT1, implicating it in rapamycin-sensitive signaling [14], and with two alternative splice variants of collybistin, a newly identified brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor [15]. The functional diversity of gephyrin identifies it as a moonlighting protein [16]: a growing class of proteins with more than one function. Sequence analysis of gephyrin indicates that it originated from a fusion of two bacterial proteins involved in Moco biosynthesis, MoeA (Figure 1) and MogA, which are connected by a linker region containing at least 140 residues. A similar domain arrangement is also observed in the Drosophila melanogoster cinnamon protein, but the connecting linker is much shorter. An independent fusion event has led to the evolution of the plant Cnx1 protein in which the two domains have been fused together in reversed order with the E domain preceding the G domain. Following the nomenclature introduced by Mendel and coworkers [17], we refer to the MoeA and MogA related segments of gephyrin, cinnamon, and Cnx1 as the E and G domains, respectively. Although most of the different activities of gephyrin have not been mapped onto its primary sequence, a recent study indicated that the binding site for the subunit of the glycine receptor is located in its G domain [18]. A direct participation of gephyrin in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis in mammalian cells and plants has been demonstrated only recently [19, 20]. Genes involved in Moco biosynthesis have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, and eukarya, and the pathway is a multistep process with two characterized intermediates [21, 22].

Summary Background: Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis is an evolutionarily conserved pathway present in archaea, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. In humans, genetic abnormalities in the biosynthetic pathway result in Moco deficiency, which is accompanied by severe neurological symptoms and death shortly after birth. The Escherichia coli MoeA and MogA proteins are involved in the final step of Moco biosynthesis: the incorporation of molybdenum into molybdopterin (MPT), the organic pyranopterin moiety of Moco. Results: The crystal structure of E. coli MoeA has been ° refined at 2 A resolution and reveals that the highly elongated MoeA monomer consists of four clearly separated domains, one of which is structurally related to MogA, indicating a divergent evolutionary relationship between both proteins. The active form of MoeA is a dimer, and a putative active site appears to be localized to a cleft formed between domain II of the first monomer and domains III and IV of the second monomer. Conclusions: In eukaryotes, MogA and MoeA are fused into a single polypeptide chain. The corresponding mammalian protein gephyrin has also been implicated in the anchoring of glycinergic receptors to the cytoskeleton at inhibitory synapses. Based on the structures of MoeA and MogA, gephyrin is surmised to be a highly organized molecule containing at least five domains. This multidomain arrangement could provide a structural basis for its functional diversity. The oligomeric states of MoeA and MogA suggest how gephyrin could assemble into a hexagonal scaffold at inhibitory synapses. Introduction The molybdenum cofactor (Moco) consists of a mononuclear molybdenum coordinated by the dithiolene moiety of one or two of a family of tricyclic pyranopterins, the simplest of which is commonly referred to as molybdopterin [1, 2]. Based on sequence similarities, enzymes containing Moco can be classified into four families [3].

Figure 1. Sequence Alignment of MoeA Proteins from Different Species Gephyrin, cinnamon, and Cnx1 are fusion proteins each containing a MogA and MoeA homologous domain, and only the residues in their E domains are shown (gephyrin and cinnamon are truncated at their N termini, Cnx1 at its C terminus). Strictly conserved and similar residues are highlighted in black and enclosed in a box, respectively. This alignment was generated with the program ALSCRIPT [49]. Secondary structure elements, as determined for the NatH1 structure with the program PROMOTIF [50], are indicated and are color coded according to their location in the different domains.

Mo-coordination [22, 25, 26]. (3) Metal incorporation into molybdopterin, which requires the functions of MoeA and MogA. Both proteins have been shown to bind molybdopterin (MPT), albeit with different affinities, as have the E and G domains of gephyrin and Cnx1 [20, 27]. Currently, there are several hypotheses regarding the respective functions of MoeA and MogA. A suggestion has been made that MoeA converts molybdate into an activated thiomolybdate derivative [28] and that MogA acts as a molybdochelatase incorporating molybdenum into molybdopterin [29]. In order to understand the function of E. coli MoeA during the biosynthesis of Moco and to study the functional diversity of gephyrin, we have determined the crystal structure of MoeA from two different crystal ° ° forms at 2.0 A and 2.7 A resolution. Together with the recently determined MogA structure [30], the building blocks of gephyrin are now available, making structural studies of gephyrin more feasible. Results and Discussion The structure of MoeA has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (Table 1) and has been re-

° fined at 2.0 A resolution (Nat I) to an R factor of 0.209 with an Rfree of 0.277 (Table 2), including refinement of individual isotropic B factors. During the initial stages of refinement, the conformations of the two monomers were tightly restrained, but these restraints were subsequently relaxed and were completely omitted in the final stages of refinement, as guided by the behavior of Rfree. The final model contains residues 7­409 in both monomers, with the first 6 and last 2 residues apparently disordered in both monomers. The stereochemistry of the model is quite good (Table 2); for instance, 89.8% of all residues are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran diagram [31], with only 3 residues (A282, A228, and B282) in generously allowed regions and no residues in disallowed regions. The overall quality of the electron density maps is good, with the exception of domain II in one of the subunits. This domain appears to be rather flexible, as indicated by its average B factor ° ° of 55.8 A2 compared to a value of 31.4 A2 for domain II of the other monomer. In addition, residues 325­327 are ° highly mobile, with average B factors of 78.0 A2 and ° 79.4 A2 in monomers I and II, respectively, and consequently are only weakly defined in the electron density maps. The structure of MoeA has also been determined

by molecular replacement from a second crystal form ° and has been refined at 2.7 A resolution (Nat II) to an R factor of 0.212 (Rfree 0.266). Unless otherwise indicated, the manuscript discusses the higher resolution Nat I MoeA model. MoeA contains two cis-peptide bonds: one between Val-50 and Pro-51 and another between Lys-279 and Pro-280. The MoeA monomer is a highly elongated L-shaped molecule (Figures 2a and 2b) and is composed of four clearly independent domains. The functional state of MoeA is dimeric (Figure 2c), and the assembly of the MoeA monomers into the dimer is discussed below. The linear arrangement of domains I to III creates the extended stalk of the MoeA monomer, which has an ° overall length of about 95 A. Although some of the domains are rather small, especially domain II, with only 90 residues, each of them contains a hydrophobic core. Residues 7­27 and 176­323 form the largest domain (domain III), consisting of a six-stranded mostly parallel sheet surrounded by helices on both sides. A structural homology search with DALI against a nonredundant set of protein structures reveals that MogA is the closest structural relative to domain III (Figure 3a),

indicating that MogA and domain III of MoeA have arisen through a gene duplication event. On the opposite end of the monomer, residues 53­140 form domain II, which consists of a central mixed four-stranded sheet with a single helix and an additional hairpin in a separate structural layer. DALI searches did not identify any structural homologs with a Z score above 2 for domain II (the highest match is a fragment of the transcriptional activator CysB, with a Z score of 1.3), suggesting that domain II has a previously unobserved fold. Domain I acts as a linker between domains II and III and is formed from residues 27­53 and 140­175, two separate segments of the polypeptide chain. The fold of this domain is dominated by two long antiparallel segments of the polypeptide chain, which are mostly in extended conformation and occasionally form short segments of a hairpin. Each of these segments is interrupted by an insertion, which contributes to the formation of the globular core of domain I. The insertion of the polypeptide leading into domain II contains a short 310 helix, and the segment returning from domain II forms a short helix. A DALI search for structural homologs revealed that this domain has the same fold

Residues 329­408 at the C terminus form domain IV, which is in close proximity to domain III and is adjacent to the connecting domain II of the second monomer. Domains III and IV are connected by a partially

flexible polypeptide loop (residues 324­328). The fold of domain IV can be described as an incomplete barrel with five mostly antiparallel strands and a short helix connected by extended but well-ordered loop regions. A DALI search revealed that this domain has the same fold as the phage display platform protein gdP [32] (Z score of 3.4), resulting in a superposition of 57 out of ° 81 residues with an rmsd of 3.4 A (Figure 3c).

MoeA forms a dimer in solution as demonstrated by sedimentation equilibrium and dynamic light scattering studies. The dynamic light scattering studies estimate a solution molecular mass of 83 kDa, consistent with a dimer, and sedimentation equilibrium studies reveal a moderately tight monomer­monomer association with a Kd of 31 nM. The crystal structure confirms that MoeA is present as a dimer, which is formed by interactions involving domains I, III, and IV from each monomer. To distinguish between domains belonging to different monomers, a prime ( ) is added to the domain number if the domain is located in the other monomer. Although the dimer is still quite elongated, with main chain dimen° ° ° sions of 44 A 44 A 115 A, it clearly has a more globular shape than the monomer (Figure 2c). About ° 2150 A2 of surface area, which correspond to 11% of

the monomer accessible surface, is buried in the dimer interface. This value is certainly not at the upper limit of those observed in protein­protein complexes, and, in agreement with the dissociation constant observed in the analytical ultracentrifugation studies, this interaction appears to be moderately stable. The MoeA interface is rich in hydrophilic residues, which constitute 65% of the buried interface, and contains 12 direct hydrogen bonds. The primary contact region involves interactions between domain III and to a smaller extent domain IV and domain I . A hydrophobic core is formed by packing the single helix of domain I into the interface area between domains III and IV, where residues Leu-161, Val-163, and Ala-165 in domain I interact with Leu-207, Leu-211, and Leu-212 from helix 4 in domain III and Phe-374 in domain IV. Most of the residues in this hy-

drophobic interface are type conserved not only in the bacterial proteins but also in the eukaryotic MoeA­MogA fusion proteins gephyrin, cinnamon, and Cnx1, suggesting that the dimerization of MoeA is an evolutionarily conserved feature. Interestingly, while crystal structures for the homologs are not yet available, the E and G domains of Cnx1 have been observed to elute as dimers and trimers, respectively, in size-exclusion chromatography experiments [27]. The two monomers have closely related structures, ° as reflected by an rmsd after superposition of 0.31 A for the C atoms of residues 7­48 and 145­409. This superposition excludes domains II and II and a few residues in the linker peptides, which are located on opposite ends of the dimer and differ in their orientation relative to the core of the dimer (Figure 4a). If the two most dissimilar monomers of the dimers found in both crystal forms are compared, domain II undergoes a 19 rotation around a hinge generated by residues 49 and 144, which are located in the junction between domains I and II. As a consequence of this movement, the cleft between domain II and domains III/IV undergoes structural changes (Figure 4b), which result in an opening and closing motion. As described above, domain II of one monomer is well defined in the electron density maps, but its counterpart has considerably higher mobility. The rmsd after superposition of domains II and II ° in the Nat I dimer is 0.66 A, which is considerably higher ° than the value of 0.31 A obtained after superposition of the remainder of the molecule. There are no major structural changes between the Nat I and II models derived from the independent crystal forms. The core of the dimer is structurally invariant, and residues excluding domains II and II in both monomers can be superim° posed with an rmsd of 0.7 A between both crystal forms.

A sequence alignment of MoeA proteins from different organisms reveals a rather low number of strictly conserved residues, even if only the eubacterial proteins are included in the alignment (Figure 1). In the context of the three-dimensional structure of MoeA, conserved residues fall into two different classes: those important for its structure and those presumably important for its function. Conserved residues, which appear to be structurally important, such as the two cis-prolines and several residues in the hydrophobic cores (Ala-62, Val111, Val-124, Val-174, Phe-286, and Leu-297), are distributed throughout the entire molecule (Figure 5a). Conserved residues, which might be important for the function of MoeA, include Asp-59, Thr-100, and Asp-142 in domain II; Glu-188, Asn-205, and Asp-228 in domain III; and Ser-371 in domain IV. In the context of the threedimensional structure of MoeA, these residues either cluster together at the cleft between domains III/IV and II (Figures 5b and 5c) or are located in a pocket on the surface of domain III. Due to the conformational changes of domain II, the dimensions and precise structure of the cleft present between domains II and III/IV is variable (Figure 4b). In the Nat I crystal structure, several glycerol molecules originating from the cryoprotectant could be mapped to this domain interface. One putative active site cleft in the dimer contains four glycerol molecules, and the other contains two glycerol molecules. One of the glycerol molecules is invariantly bound at the short end of the L-shaped cleft within a hydrophobic hole (Figure 5b), which is created by residues 142­150 and 48­51 located in the linker between domains I and II , residues 163­166 in the single helix of domain I , and residues 373­375 of domain IV. Based on indirect evidence (sequence conservation, conformational changes, and site-directed mutagenesis

The protein is shown in a surface representation, and conserved residues have been mapped onto the molecular surface.

(b) View into the interface between domains III/IV and II in the MoeA dimer. Domains III/ IV and II are located to the right and left, respectively, of the cleft. A small counterclockwise rotation of the bottom monomer, followed by a translation of the two monomers toward each other, generates the dimer and brings the conserved residues highlighted in red and blue into close spatial proximity.

data), the MPT binding site in MogA has been mapped adjacent to and into a pocket near the N-terminal end of the mostly parallel central sheet. The active site in MogA is in close proximity to the TXGGTG signature sequence motif (residues 72­77), which is found in all MogA orthologs. In addition, two highly conserved Asp residues, Asp-49 and Asp-82, were found to be essential for MogA activity [30]. A random mutagenesis screen with the G domain of Cnx1 independently identified one of the Asp residues (corresponding to Asp-49 of E. coli)

as a critical residue [33]. Both studies revealed that this substitution does not impair MPT binding by MogA but instead precludes the Mo insertion step [33]. Since MogA and domain III of MoeA are structurally related and both bind MPT, it is tempting to speculate that the MPT binding site is at least partially conserved between both proteins. Residues 249­254 (SSGGVS) of MoeA display limited sequence homology to the TXGGTG motif of MogA and, like their counterparts, form a loop connecting the third strand and third helix of domain

III. In addition, Asp-228 in MoeA, the residue corresponding to Asp-49 of E. coli MogA, is conserved. As described above, these residues are located in or near the cleft of the MoeA dimer. Although it is less deep, the surface pocket in domain III of MoeA appears to correspond to the pocket in the MogA surface. The MoeA-related E domains of gephyrin and Cnx1 have been shown to bind MPT [20, 27] with a Kd in the low micromolar range in a cooperative binding process. E. coli MoeA also binds molybdopterin as well as molybdopterin guanine nucleotide (MGD) (J. N. and K. V. R., unpublished data). Given the sequence conservation among MoeA orthologs, the cleft between domains III/ IV and II (Figures 5b and 5c) appears to be the most likely binding site for MPT and MGD. Electrostatic calculations identify the face of domain III pointing toward domain II as the only region that is significantly charged. This face has two oppositely charged but clearly separated regions: an electronegative area including Asp187, Glu-188, Asp-228, Asp-229, Glu-257, and Asp-259 and a positively charged region created by Lys-275, Lys279, Lys-282, Lys-310, Arg-345, and Arg-388 (Figure 5c). The observed cooperative MPT binding behavior of MoeA-like domains of Cnx1 and gephyrin [20, 27] might be explained by assuming that the conformational changes of domain II, which alter the shape of the cleft region, are part of an allosteric mechanism of MoeA. Structural changes resulting from MPT binding at one end of MoeA would be transmitted to the second binding site, leading to an increase in binding affinity for the second MPT. The postulated binding site elegantly explains a recently characterized mutation within the Cnx1 E domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana chl6 mutant, which showed that substitution of the strictly conserved glycine corresponding to residue 101 of E. coli MoeA by Asp inactivates the Moco biosynthetic function of the E domain of Cnx1 [34]. Gly-101 is located in a turn and points into the proposed active site cleft. Substitution with Asp could potentially interfere with substrate binding, but it could also lead to structural changes, since the observed main chain dihedral angles ( 83 and 16 ) can only be adopted by a glycine. In higher eukaryotes, MoeA and MogA are fused into a single polypeptide chain. This fusion event has occurred independently twice during evolution; in the Drosophila cinnamon and mammalian gephyrin proteins, the MogA domain is at the N terminus, followed by the MoeA domain at the C terminus, whereas it is reversed in the Arabidopsis Cnx1 protein. In gephyrin, an extended linker region with at least 140 amino acids connects the MogA and MoeA domains. A secondary structure prediction with PHD [35] suggests that the connecting linker of gephyrin is mostly unstructured and presumably does not fold into a globular domain. The N and C ° termini of MoeA are located 32 A apart on opposite sides of domain IV. Based on the crystal structures of MogA and MoeA and the constraints arising from the rather short length ( 30 residues) of the linker, a domain arrangement can be proposed for Cnx1. We have constructed a speculative model (data not shown) based on the assumption that the G domain of Cnx1 is in rather close proximity to domain IV to which it is covalently linked and is located on the same side of domain IV as

Figure 6. Model for a Hexagonal Gephyrin Scaffold Schematic representation of the hexagonal gephyrin scaffold created by trimerization and dimerization of its G domains (light gray spheres) and E domains (dark gray), respectively. Assuming that the three-fold axis of the G domain trimer and the two-fold axis of the E domain dimer are parallel, an infinite two-dimensional lattice of gephyrin molecules can be created. Model-building studies indicate that, due to the dimensions of the E and G domains, the resulting gephyrin layer is much more closely packed than suggested by this schematic diagram.

the C terminus of the protein. Assuming that the E domain of Cnx1 is also dimeric, the possible arrangements for the G domain of Cnx1 are further reduced due to spatial constraints introduced by the second E domain. The proposed model for Cnx1 brings the putative active site cleft of MoeA into close proximity with the active site of MogA, which would allow a rapid transfer of intermediates between the two active sites. Interestingly, the hydrophobic hole created at the backside of the putative active site cleft in MoeA (Figure 5b) might allow channeling of intermediates between the active sites in the E and G domains. The modular architecture of MoeA provides clues regarding the functional diversity of gephyrin. Gephyrin directly interacts with a variety of different proteins, including the subunit of the glycine receptor and tubulin [10, 11], the actin binding protein profilin [12], the DNAactivating protein kinase RAFT1 [14], and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor collybistin [15]. At present, little is known about the binding sites for these proteins on gephyrin, but the linker region has been proposed to mediate most of these interactions. For example, a proline-rich motif in the linker region has been postulated to be the binding site for profilin [12]. Given the large number of gephyrin binding partners, it is likely that some of these proteins interact not only with the linker region, as demonstrated by the interaction of the G domain with the subunit of the glycine receptor [18]. Based on the modular nature of the MoeA structure, it is possible that some of its individual domains could be involved in protein­protein interactions. In contrast to Cnx1, the E and G domains of gephyrin could be oriented relative to each other in many different ways due to the extended length of the linker. However, the orientation postulated for Cnx1 could be easily adopted by gephyrin due to its much larger linker size.

Crystal Structure of the E. coli MoeA Protein 307

Based on the strong tendency of gephyrin to form higher order structures in vitro and in transfected cells, Kneussel and Betz [36] have recently proposed the existence of a submembraneous gephyrin scaffold, which could serve to recruit inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors to synaptic sites. Based on the trimeric arrangement of the E. coli MogA protein [30], a hexagonal lattice of gephyrin molecules was proposed. This model postulated either a second self-interaction domain in gephyrin or coassembly with a connector protein. The dimeric MoeA crystal structure suggests that the assembly into a hexagonal scaffold could be accomplished through dimerization of the E domains and trimerization of the G domains, even in the absence of a connector protein (Figure 6). A key feature of the proposed model is the association of the G and E domains with their counterparts in different molecules rather than the same molecule in a domain-swapped arrangement, which allows a layer-like structure to be formed. The resulting hexagonal scaffold is pseudocontinuous and provides evenly spaced receptor binding sites, which would be crucial for achieving the required high concentrations of either the glycine or GABAA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. In addition, the two-dimensional gephyrin layer will also have a distinctive polarity, which could facilitate interactions either with molecules embedded in the lipid bilayer or with components of the cytoskeleton. To allow for the oligomerization process to be reversible, one could envision that either the G domain trimer or the E domain dimer interface of gephyrin is disrupted. Based on the available crystal structures of E. coli MoeA and MogA, it is more likely that dimerization of the E domain could be interrupted, since the subunit interface of MoeA is rich in hydrophilic residues and the two monomers do not have a very high affinity for each other. Monomerization of MoeA could be achieved by reversible binding of one of the partner proteins of gephyrin to the E domain, leading to a rearrangement of either domain I or III, which could preclude MoeA dimerization. The covalently linked structure of gephyrin provides another example of a eukaryotic fusion protein in which two prokaryotic proteins have been combined. The initial evolutionary driving force for this fusion event has been the functional connection between the prokaryotic MoeA and MogA proteins, which possibly form a transient protein­protein complex. Only subsequently has gephyrin acquired its additional functions during clustering of inhibitory neuronal receptors. The essential role of gephyrin during Moco biosynthesis in mammals and the importance of this pathway for the proper development of the central nervous system has been demonstrated by the finding that a gephyrin knockout in mice causes symptoms consistent with sulfite oxidase deficiency and is in fact lethal [19].

gene encoding sulfite oxidase or lesions in the Moco biosynthetic pathway. In E. coli, the MoeA and MogA proteins are involved in the attachment of molybdenum to the cis-dithiolene group of a tricyclic pyranopterin commonly referred to as molybdopterin. In mammals, insects, and plants, the MoeA and MogA sequences are fused into a single polypeptide, but the topology of the domains in the plant protein is reversed compared to gephyrin, its mammalian counterpart. Gephyrin was initially isolated as a factor needed for anchoring glycinergic receptors to the cytoskeleton at postsynaptic membranes. More recently, gephyrin was shown to interact with at least five different proteins, thus suggesting that it plays a central role in organizing the postsynaptic membrane at inhibitory synapses containing either glycinergic receptors or GABAA receptor subtypes. In this contribution we describe the purification and crystal structure of E. coli MoeA. The structure is derived ° ° from two orthorhombic crystal forms at 2 A and 2.7 A resolution. The protein has a modular four-domain architecture and is a highly elongated molecule. In the crystal and in solution, the protein exists as a dimer with a predominantly hydrophilic interface. Based on sequence conservation, the active site is proposed to be located in a cleft between domains III and IV of one monomer and domain II of the second monomer. The dimeric structure of MoeA defined in this study and the trimeric architecture of MogA established earlier suggest that gephyrin might form a hexagonal scaffold below the postsynaptic membrane, which guides receptor recruitment. The available crystal structures of MoeA and MogA provide structural models for gephyrin and will further facilitate structural and biochemical studies into the multiple roles of this protein.
Experimental Procedures Cloning, Expression, and Purification of MoeA The E. coli moeA gene was cloned from genomic DH5 DNA with the aid of PCR. Using the published gene sequence [37], primers were designed to allow cloning into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET11a expression vector (Novagen) to yield pJNeA11. For expression, l liter cultures of BL21(DE3) cells carrying the plasmid were grown to OD600 0.8 at 37 C. The cells were induced with 0.25 mM isoproyl- -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and harvested after 4 hr of aerobic growth at 30 C. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT and frozen at 20 C. All buffers used during purification contained 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), with additional components as indicated. During purification, MoeA presence and purity were monitored using SDS-PAGE. The thawed cell suspension was passed three times through a cell cracker. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 g. The cleared lysate was slowly raised to 35% saturation (194 g/ liter) with solid (NH4)2SO4 at 4 C and then centrifuged at 20,000 g. The resulting supernatant was brought to 50% saturation by the addition of 87 g/liter (NH4)2SO4. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT and dialyzed overnight against buffer containing 1 mM DTT. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose column, and MoeA was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1­0.35 M NaCl. This and subsequent chromatography steps were performed using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Fractions containing MoeA were pooled and brought to 20% ammonium sulfate at room temperature prior to injection onto a Phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 20% ammonium sulfate. The column was eluted with a 20%­0%

Biological Implications Moco biosynthesis is an evolutionarily conserved pathway present in all phyla. Sulfite oxidase deficiency leads to severe neurological symptoms and premature death in humans and is the result of either mutations in the

ammonium sulfate gradient, and fractions containing MoeA were pooled and dialyzed overnight. After concentration, the sample was chromatographed on a Superose 12 column equilibrated with buffer containing 100 mM NaCl. Fractions containing pure MoeA were pooled and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. The total yield of MoeA was 60 mg/liter of cells. For purified MoeA, a concentration of 1 mg/ml yields an OD280 0.61. Selenomethionine Substitution of MoeA Selenomethionine (SeMet) substitution of E. coli MoeA was accomplished as described [38]. For expression of SeMet-MoeA, metB834(DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with pJNeA11 and grown in minimal medium composed of 87 mM Na2HPO4, 46 mM KH2PO4, 18 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 2 g/liter glucose, 1.7 mM MgSO4, 0.117 mM CaCl2, 0.015 mM FeSO4, 0.075 mM thiamine, and 0.3 mM methionine or selenomethionine (Sigma). Cultures (1 liter) 0.8 at 37 C in minimal medium containing were grown to OD600 methionine. The cells were resuspended in minimal medium containing selenomethionine for 15 min prior to induction with 0.25 mM IPTG at 30 C for 4 hr. Purification of SeMet-MoeA was accomplished as described above, except that all purification buffers contained 5 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA. Substitution of all 8 methionine residues was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Oligomerization State of MoeA Dynamic light scattering experiments of MoeA were performed at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl at room temperature. Under these conditions, MoeA has a diffusion constant of 5.6 nm/s2, a hydrodynamic radius of 4.0 nm, and an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa, corresponding to a dimer. For comparison, monomeric MoeA has a molecular mass of 44 kDa. Sedimentation equilibrium was performed in a Beckman model XLA ultracentrifuge in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl at 12,000 rpm and 20 C using three different protein concentrations (the initial protein sample had an A280 1.0). Initial analysis of the UV scans by the XLA-Ideal 1 software method indicated an association behavior for the protein. Analysis by the XLA-Multifit self-association software and by the self-association program kindly provided by Allen Minton (NIH-NIDDK) indicated a monomer­dimer equilibrium with a Kd of 31 nM. Crystallization and Structure Determination Needle-shaped MoeA crystals were obtained after a few days by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 10%­ 15% PEG 6000 or PEG 8000 and 0.2­0.5 M calcium acetate in 0.1 M cacodylic acid (pH 6.5). The crystals belong to space group ° ° ° 88.3 A, b 97.4 A, and c 98.7 A, and contain P212121, with a two monomers per asymmetric unit, giving rise to a solvent content of 48%. Prior to data collection, all crystals were transferred into mother liquor containing 30% glycerol as cryoprotectant and were flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. The structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement using a Hg-derivative (1 mM EMTS, for 1­2 hr), Ir-derivative (10 mM Na3[IrCl6], for 1 day), Sm-derivative (10 mM Sm-acetate, for 1 day), and SeMet-substituted protein. With the exception of the SeMet derivative, all diffraction data were collected on beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source ° at Brookhaven National Laboratory, at a wavelength of 1.1 A on a Quantum IV ADSC CCD detector. The SeMet data set was collected ° at beamline X12B at 0.98 A on a Quantum IV ADSC CCD detector. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with the HKL software [39]. For subsequent calculations, the CCP4 suite was used with exceptions as indicated [40]. The EMTS derivative was solved by direct methods using SHELX [41], and all other derivatives were solved by difference Fourier calculations using the phases derived from the EMTS derivative. Phase refinement was performed with SHARP [42] to a resolution ° of 2.3 A followed by solvent flattening with SOLOMON [43], which led to an increase in the FOM from 0.36 to 0.85 and a concomitant improvement in the quality of the electron density maps. Attempts to automatically trace the polypeptide chain with ARP [44] failed, but the resulting maps appeared to be of superior quality and were

used to manually build corresponding segments of the polypeptide in both monomers with the program O [45]. To further improve the maps, 2-fold averaging was done with DM [40], and an atomic model of one monomer was built. The second monomer was generated ° with the ncs operation and the resulting model was refined at 2.0 A resolution by torsion angle dynamics refinement with X-PLOR [46], incorporating tight restraints for the noncrystallographic symmetry. An inspection of the electron density maps of both monomers revealed very weak density for domain II in the second monomer, and this domain was repositioned, guided by the electron density maps. During further refinement rounds with X-PLOR, two different segments were defined for the ncs restraints, with domain II comprising the second segment. Refinement was continued with REFMAC [47] against all observed reflections (no cutoff) incorporating individual isotropic B factors, a bulk solvent correction to include the low-resolution reflections, and an overall anisotropic B factor correction. Solvent molecules were automatically added with ARP. A second crystal form (Nat II) was found under similar crystallization conditions. These crystals also belong to space group P212121 and contain two monomers in the asymmetric unit but have different ° ° ° cell dimensions, with a 68.9 A, b 98.6 A, and c 159.4 A, leading to an increased solvent content of 59%. Diffraction data were collected at NSLS beamline X26C as described above, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using Amore [48]. The model was initially refined by torsion angle dynamics using ° X-PLOR at 2.7 A resolution, followed by cartesian dynamics at lower temperatures. Tight ncs restraints (excluding domain II) were applied throughout the refinement, and solvent molecules were automatically added with ARP.
