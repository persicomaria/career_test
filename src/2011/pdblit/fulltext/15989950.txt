Summary - A vsrianl form of Eschmrichio co/i ribmemal protein L7/Ll2 that lacked residues 42 to 92 (L7fi12. M?-52) in rhe hinge region was shown previously to be completely inactive in bupperting pelypkenylalanine synrkesis although it boa;d u, L7A.12 icles wtth the normal stoichiomrtry of four copies per particle (Oleinikov AV. Pmuud B. Wang B. Traut RR (1993) deRcient carp" t% Y 17-922). The msult suggested Ikat the hinge fonfers flexibility that is required for activity because tkc resulting J Bid Chem. bent conformation allows the distal C-terminal domain to occupy a location on the body of the large ribosomal subunit proximal to the bax of the L~ILI 2 stalk where rlongarirn factors bind. Factor Li&ing to tke hinge-mmcated varirm was tested. As a" alternative strategy to deleting residues from the hinge. seven amim, acid res~Jues within the putative hinge region we= replaced by sew" co".secutive proli"e residues in a" attempt to confer increased rigidity that might reduce or e:iminate the bending of the molecule illr& to be functionally important. This variant. L7ILl2:(Pmh. remained Fully active in petein synthesis. Wlbereas the binding of both factors in ribosomes containing L7/Ll2:A42-92 was decreased by ahwt Xl%. there was no loss of factor binding in ribosemes contai"ing L7/Ll2:(Pmh. as predicted from the retentimt of pmtei" synthesis activity. The fact"rzriboseme complexes that mntained L7/Ll2:A42-52 had the same low level of GTP hydrolysis as IC` core particles completely tacking L71Ll2 and EFG did "et support thutslocation measured by the reaction of phc-tRNA bound in > A site with puromyci". It is concluded that tl~ hinge region is required for the functionally pmductive binding of elongation facttin. and the defect in protein synthesis reperred previously is due to this defect. The variant produced by the introduction of the putative rigid Pm, sequence retains sufficient flexibility for full activity. L7iLIZ I EF-G I EF-lb I GTP hydrolysJs I binge deletion

Introduction
Escherichiu co/i L7/Ll2 is a dimeric ribosomal protein and there are two dimers per 50s subunit. The protein dimer consists of two organized domains: I) an N-tenninal domain corresponding to residues I to 36 121 that is responsible both for the strong dimer interaction 131 and for binding to LIO to form the pentameric complex that integrates both dimers into the ribosome 141; 2) a C-terminal domain corresponding to residues 53 to 120 that is required for interactions with elongation factors 15-71. The two domains are connected to each other by amino acid residues 37 to 52. a region that has properties consistent with a flexible hinge structure It?]. The flexibility of L7/Ll2 has been demonstrated by proton NMR 19. IO], Ruorcscencc techniques 1I II and electron microscopy [ 12. *cmespo"de"ce

131. The dimers are required for optimal rates of pro tein synthesis and for fidelity. They exert their effect through promoting the interaction of large ribosomal subunits with elongation factors. Our mcent studies concerning lhe mechanism of action of the L7/L12 Jtmers have addressed two interrelated aspcts of this phenomenon. One concerns the ribosomal locati:m(s) of the two dimers and how this is related to the binding and function of elongation factors [ 141. A second concerns the domain structure and conformation of the dimer i,s:If II. 151. We showed by cross-linking [ 161 and immune electron micmscouv .,. 112. 141 that the two dimers can exist . in different locations on the ribosome. One corresponds to an extended conformation of one or both dimers that then form the L7/Ll2 stalk with the C-termina: domain distal to LIO at the base of the stalk where the N-:erminal domain binds. The second corresponds to a bent, or closed conformation in which both the C- and N-terminal domains are located near LIO and each other. The two observations: first, that it is the C-terminal domain that is required for factor

Results on binding of both factors to tibosomal particles reconstituted with different mutant proteins a summarized in table Ll. Binding of both factors is decreased approximately 50% in case of PO cores reconstituted with M2-52L7/L12 relatively to the PO cores rwmstituted with wild type L7b12. Tbe presence of seven proline residues in the hinge region had oo effect on the binding of EF-G. Tlte extent of binding was observed whether measured aa described above. or by gel liltm!.on or sucmse gradient centrifugation (data not shown). Since the protein synthesis activity and EF-G:GDP:fusidic a&l complex binding were the same as wild type, the EF-IIt binding of the particles reconstituted with L7/LIZ:(Pto), was not tested. The rate of EF-G dependent GTP hydrolysis is shown in figure 2. Core particles reconstituted with wild type L7/L12 hydrolyzed GTP to the same extent as control ribosomes. In contrast, particles reconstituted with the deletion variant were inactive to the same extent as POcores, &spite the binding of signiticant amounts of factor. Particles reconstituted with the polj-pro variant hydrolyzed GTP as efficiently as wild type L7/L12. indicating that in this case the binding Table I.

There were four sets of reactions and symbols used m the same a.5in figure 2. ding. This implies a bent conformation that has been presumed to be facilitated by a flexible hinge linking the two domains. The presence of residue 53 in the organized C-terminal domain marks this boundary of the putative hinge region. The N-terminal boundaty is loss clearly &fined, but likely is between residues 35 and 39. The experiments described here were designed to define furtber those properties of th: hinge region of L7/L12 requited to permit its functional binding to the ribosome. and the binding of elongation factors to the tibosome:L7/Ll2 complex. It has been demonstrated previously that deletion of residues 35-52 led to impaired binding to the tibosome, with total toss of functional activity;and that a shorter deletion of residues 42-52 led to normal stoichiometrv of binding, but again with total loss of functional ac&ity Ill. Deletions of residues 38-52 and 44-52 also led to nearly complete loss of activity 1271. It was also demonstrated that substitution of residues 38-52 bv a reference sequence of the same length, or extensionof the wild type hinge by the same reference sequence had little etTect on activity in protein synthesis (261. The results in this paper clarify which step of biosynthesis is affected in ribosome panicles reconstituted with the hinge deletion L7/L12 variant thl! bound with normal 4copy stoichiometty and test further the

flexibility hypothesis by construction of a L7/LJ2 variant with a putativr!y more rigid seven proline sequence substituting for wild type residues in the hinge region The bindtng of both elongation factors is impaired in ribosomes reconstituted with the deletion variant. Such particles bind factors at about 50% of the level found for control ribosomes. More important. it is shown here that the factors bound to these particles did not support either GTE-hydrolysis or uanalocation. The binding of factors to ribosome teconstituted with hinge deletion mutant protein is probably abnormal and non-functional. The importance of flexibility of the hinge region was not addressed in the previous work in which a new amino acid sequence replaced the hinge 1261. To shed light on this aspect we prepared a vartant containing seven consecudve pmlhtes~in the hinge region in the exnectation that this orotein would have the decrea&d functional activity due to the documented rigidity of a poly(L-pmline), II insert [28]. Surprisingly the poly-pmline variant was indistinguishable from wild tvne L7/Ll2 in all functional tests. Most likely this s&titution by pmline of the seven residues at the C-terminal end of the hinge is not long enough, and that remaininn residues at the N-terminal end of the hinge retain &fficient flexibility `for functional interactions of the C-terminal domain at the factor binding site. Pmliminaty results on the absence of any effect of the oroline substitution on the mobilitv of fluorescent p&es attached to the C-terminal domain (D Jameson and B Hamman, persottal cotnmtmication) support this suggestion. The question about the extent of hinge flexibility required for L7iL12 function remains open. Acknowledgment This work WBSsupported by United States Public Health Ser. vice Grant GM 17924 (RRT).
