Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes severe invasive infections including scarlet fever, pharyngitis (streptococcal sore throat), skin infections, necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease), septicemia, erysipelas, cellulitis, acute rheumatic fever, and toxic shock. The conversion from nonpathogenic to toxigenic strains of S. pyogenes is frequently mediated by bacteriophage infection. One of the key bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors is a putative ``hyaluronidase,'' HylP1, a phage tail-fiber protein responsible for the digestion of the S. pyogenes hyaluronan capsule during phage infection. Here we demonstrate that HylP1 is a hyaluronate lyase. The 3D structure, at 1.8-Å resolution, reveals an unusual triple-stranded -helical structure and provides insight into the structural basis for phage tail assembly and the role of phage tail proteins in virulence. Unlike the triple-stranded -helix assemblies of the bacteriophage T4 injection machinery and the tailspike endosialidase of the Escherichia coli K1 bacteriophage K1F, HylP1 possesses three copies of the active center on the triple-helical fiber itself without the need for an accessory catalytic domain. The triple-stranded -helix is not simply a structural scaffold, as previously envisaged; it is harnessed to provide a 200-Å-long substrate-binding groove for the optimal reduction in hyaluronan viscosity to aid phage penetration of the capsule.

treptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes a wide range of acute infections in the respiratory tract and skin with invasive infections causing the life-threatening ``flesheating'' disease, necrotizing fasciitis, and the pyrogenic exotoxinassociated toxic shock syndrome (1). In 1927 it was demonstrated that S. pyogenes could be converted from a noninfective to a toxigenic state through the application of a soluble extract of scarlet fever isolates (2), which was subsequently shown to contain bacteriophage. Several of the virulence factors produced by S. pyogenes strains are now known to be bacteriophageencoded. These factors include pyrogenic exotoxins A and C (3, 4), DNase (5), and ``hyaluronidase'' (6). Indeed, the involvement of phage-encoded virulence factors is now known to be a feature common to many bacterial pathogens (7, 8) with bacteriophage implicated in genome rearrangement (9) and, in the case of Streptococcus, interstrain transfer of pyrogenic exotoxin (Spe) genes (5, 10, 11). Spes, notably virulence factors SpeC and SpeA, are ``superantigens'' that directly cross-link the major histocompatibility complex class II on the antigen-presenting cells with T cell receptors, stimulating between 5% and 30% of the total T cell population (5, 12). The increased amounts of inflammatory cytokines result in the symptoms of scarlet fever and, in some cases, toxic shock (1, 12, 13). Spe genes are expressed at prophage induction (5), and the simultaneous induction of SpeC and prophage was shown to be mediated by a ``soluble factor'' by coculturing streptococci with pharyngeal cells (14).

events inducing conversion from lysogenic to a lytic cycle remain, however, unclear. The genome sequencing of S. pyogenes strain SF370, revealed three full-length prophage sequences (15) belonging to the Siphoviridae family of bacteriophage ( -like bacteriophage with long noncontractile tails). Of particular interest is the hyaluronidase ORF, HylP1, annotated among the tail fiber genes within the SF370.1 prophage (Fig. 1a). The likely role of this hyaluronidase is to allow phage penetration of the streptococcal hyaluronic acid (HA) capsule (16) (Fig. 1b) during transfection. To gain insight into the phage-mediated conversion to pathogenicity, in particular the role of the putative tail-fiber hyaluronidase, biochemical and structural analysis of HylP1 (from the only prophage of S. pyogenes SF370 that has been shown to be inducible, prophage SF370.1) was undertaken. We confirm that HylP1 is in fact a hyaluronate lyase, catalyzing a -elimination reaction as first proposed by Baker et al. (17) and not a hyaluronan hydrolase. The 3D structure reveals a central triply wound -helix on a protein 220 Å in length. All previous observations of this unusual fold have been phage-tail proteins, giving considerable credence to a similar role in phage SF370.1. It is widely believed that the triple-stranded -helix (TS H) motif is characteristic of structural proteins from viral tails, yet in marked contrast to the triple-stranded -helical structures of the bacteriophage T4 injection machine (18) and the phages infecting the polysialic-acid-encapsulated human pathogen Escherichia coli K1 (19), the catalytic center of HylP1 does not reside on an accessory catalytic domain but on the triplestranded -helical core itself, whose organization may shed light on the assembly of the Siphoviridae tail fibers themselves.

HylP1 Assays. Assays were performed spectrophotometrically at 37°C in triplicate at 232 nm by using a 1-cm pathlength quartz cuvette containing 2 mg ml 1 substrate in 50 mM NH4 Ac buffer (pH 6.5) unless otherwise stated. A molar absorptivity value of 5.5 103 liter mol 1 cm 1 was used for concentration calculations (21). All polymeric substrates, hyaluronan (K salt) from umbilical cord, chondroitin 4-sulfate (Na salt) from bovine trachea, and chondroitin 6-sulfate (Na salt) from shark cartilage, were treated with EDTA and dialyzed extensively before use (22). The range of hyaluronan concentrations used for determining kcat and Km values was 1.3­3 mg ml 1. Goodness-of-fit statistical analysis of the linear trendlines of the resulting Lineweaver­Burke plots produced R2 values of 0.9935. Highperformance anion-exchange chromatography was performed according to the method of Lauder et al. (23). Circular Dichroism (CD). A J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco U.K.

The first set of primers used were 5 -ATggCAATCAATgggTCAAg-3 and 5 -ggATCCCTATTTTTTTAgTATgAg-3 . The amplified product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and designated pHylP1 5 . The hylp1 ORF was amplified from pHylP1 5 by using 5 -CATATgAgTgAAAATATACCgCTg3- and 5 -ggATCCCTATTTTTTTAgTATgAg-3 and cloned into pET28a (Novagen) on an NdeI­ BamHI fragment and designated pHylP1. The conditions used for amplification were as specified for use with Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Plasmids pD137A and pY149A were generated from pHylP1 by using the QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and mutagenic primer pairs 5 -gTggAgCggTCA ATAT TgCgT TgTCgTCTACCAgAg3- and 5 -CTCTggTAgACgACAACgCAATATTgACCgCTCCAC3- , and 5 -ggTgCTggTgTTgTTgTCgCgTCTgACAATgATACCAgTg-3 and 5 -CACTggTATCATTgTCAgACgCgACAACAACACCAgCAC C-3 , respectively.
Production and Purification of HylP1 and Derivatives. N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged HylP1 was produced through induction of pHylP1-containing E. coli BL21 (DE3; Novagen) cultures grown at 30°C. HylP1 was purified by means of affinity chromatography using nickel-charged Sepharose chelating fast flow resin (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, U.K.), followed by gel filtration using a HiLoad 16 60 Superdex 200 prep grade column and concentrated and exchanged into 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) 50 mM CaCl2 using a 10-kDa cut-off concentrator unit (Vivascience, Hannover, Germany). D137A and Y149A were produced and purified as for the native enzyme, except they were produced from pD137A- and pY149A-containing E. coli BL21, respectively. Seleno-methionine HylP1 was produced and purified as for the native protein, except it was produced from E. coli B834 (DE3; Novagen), and 10 mM DTT was incorporated to all

Ltd., Great Dunmow, Essex, U.K.) was used for CD analysis of native and mutant derivatives of HylP1. CD spectra (260­210 nm) averaged from 15 scans were collected at 20°C by using a bandwidth setting of 3 nm, a scanning speed of 100 nm min 1, and a 1-mm-pathlength cuvette. Unfolding curves of the proteins in the presence of 0­5 M guanidinium hydrochloride were generated by using the 218-nm ellipticity values (see Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The protein concentration used was 4.0 mg ml 1 in 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) 50 mM CaCl2, and the free energy of the folded and unfolded forms of each protein was determined by least-squares analysis of the data points from the transition region of the unfolding curves of the proteins.
Crystallization and Structure Solution. HylP1 was crystallized from

1 l of HylP1 (at 10­20 mg ml 1) with 1­2 l of the mother liquor (3.25 M sodium formate); 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol was incorporated into the mother liquor to both improve crystal quality and the ease of freezing. An additional 15% 2-methyl2,4-pentanediol was included in the stabilizing solution before flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected from single crystals at 120 K at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Multiple anomalous difference (MAD) data were collected on beamline ID 14-EH4 and native data on ID 14-EH1. X-ray data were processed with MOSFLM (24), with subsequent computing using programs from the CCP4 suite (25) unless explicitly stated. Crystals belong to the rhombohedral space group H32 with the approximate cell dimensions of a b 58.5 Å, c 586.6 Å. The structure was solved by using selenomethionine multiple-wavelength data, with final phasing incorporating native data. Initial phasing used the seleno-methionine MAD data, through MLPHARE, with sites determined by using SHELXD (26). Final phasing incorporated native data, and phases were subsequently improved and extended to 1.8 Å by using DM (27) from the CCP4 suite. Five percent of the data were flagged for cross-validation, and subsequently REFMAC (28) in conjunction with ARPWARP (29) (both CCP4 suite) were used to build the sequence into the electron density automatically. QUANTA and X-FIT (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego) were used to make manual corrections to the model. Solvent molecules were added using X-SOLVATE routines of XFIT and checked manually. The final structure, refined at 1.8-Å resolution, has Rcryst 0.19, Rfree 0.23 with deviations from stereochemical target values of 0.012 Å for bonds and 1.3° for angles (Table 1).

Results and Discussion Carbohydrate-active enzymes, notably glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases, glycosyltransferases, and polysaccharide lyases, have been grouped together into a large number of sequence-based families. There are almost 100 glycoside hydrolase families but merely 15 families of polysaccharide lyase, this discrepancy reflecting the absolute requirement for uronic-acid substrates for the latter enzyme class. Prior to this work, glycoside hydrolase CAZy (http: afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr CAZY) family 69 (GH69) contained 26 ORFs, all from bacteriophage that infect streptococcal strains (predominantly S. pyogenes but also S. equi) that were predominantly annotated as hydrolytic hyaluronidases (EC 3.2.1.35). A feature of this enzyme family is its very high degree of sequence conservation

complete degradation of connective tissue, or even HA itself. Instead, it would appear that the role of HylP1 is the introduction of widely spaced cuts in HA to facilitate a local reduction in capsule viscosity to aid phage invasion of the bacterial host.

coccus SF370 virulence factor hyaluronidase, HylP1, was expressed as a full-length 38.4-kDa N-terminally hexahistidinetagged protein. HylP1 is active in the degradation of HA with a kcat of 7.2 0.9 s 1 and Km 1.47 0.02 mg ml 1. Increase in absorbance at 232 nm is consistent with the action of a lyase ( -eliminase) whose action results in the production of a 4,5 unsaturated product (Fig. 1c). The enzyme is not a hydrolase, as implied by the enzyme commission number, but instead HylP1 [and its sequence homologs such as the S. pyogenes bacteriophage H4489A enzyme (17)] are polysaccharide lyases. Consequently, all the former GH69 enzymes have been reassigned to a new PL family, PL16. In contrast to the unrelated hyaluronate lyases from group B streptococci, whose function is the degradation of the hostorganism connective tissue to facilitate pathogen invasion (31­ 34), HylP1 is inactive on other connective tissue glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin 4-sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate. The in vivo function of HylP1 is further revealed by product analysis. In stark contrast to the group B streptococcal enzymes, indeed to any previously characterized carbohydrate-active enzymes, the end products of HylP1 digestion of HA are long oligosaccharides, predominantly HA6 and HA8, with small amounts of HA4, HA10 and longer (Fig. 2). HylP1 thus has an endo (random internal cut) mechanism of action with a greatly extended substrate-binding region, which requires at least four to six kinetically significant subsites on either side of the cleavage site. The function of HylP1 is therefore unlikely to be the

The 3D Structure of HylP1 Reveals a Catalytically Active TS H. The 3D structure of HylP1 was solved by using three-wavelength multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion data from a selenomethionyl-derived protein, and harnessing native data to 1.8 Å, HylP1 crystallizes in the H32 (hexagonal setting) rhombohedral cell with unusual cell dimensions of a b 58.5 Å, c 586.6 Å. The structure of HylP1 is composed of three intertwined polypeptides centered on a crystallographic threefold axis. The structure (Fig. 3a) can be traced from residue 6 through to the C terminus, with the sole exception of the loop from Ala-122 to Ser-128,

which is disordered and which may (see below) also be implicated in catalysis. The N-terminal domain (7­35) forms a mixed capping region that is followed by a coiled region globular and segmented -helical coiled-coils to residue 108. The central ``core'' of HylP1 then follows, a single extended right-handed TS H in the form of an irregular triangular tube, where each of the three faces of the tube is composed of alternating -strands from each of the three polypeptides, with the -strands orthogonal to the long axis of the enzyme. The faces of the strands are deeply concave, contributing to an extended polysaccharide-

binding surface (Fig. 4; discussed below). The TS H of HylP1 is composed of residues Lys-108 through to Leu-281 and is 65 Å in length. The repeat on each side of the TS H varies between 8 and 19 residues per turn. At the C terminus of the TS H there is a short stretch from Ser-282 to Lys-297 where the -sheets do not intertwine but interdigitate. The remainder of the 220-Ålong structure is composed of random coil and an -helical ``nose.'' To our knowledge, the TS H structural element has been observed in three other bacteriophage tail proteins: the T4 short tail fiber gp12 (35) and cell-puncturing device gp5 (36) and the core structure of the E. coli K1 bacteriophage K1F endo-2,8sialidase (19). The latter two proteins also are involved in phage infection of the bacterial host through degradation of the cell-wall peptidoglycan and capsular polysialic acid, respectively. Threefold symmetry is thus a feature of tail-fiber proteins, manifesting itself in another such protein, tailspike gp9 of bacteriophage P22, except in this case not as a TS H but as three single-stranded parallel -helices (37). The width of each face of the triangular tube formed by the HylP1 TS H varies from 49 Å at the widest point (Asn-274) to 20 Å at its narrowest. Thus, in contrast to gp5 and gp12, whose shape is regular and ``smooth,'' the TS H domain of HylP1 is both irregular and concave. Beyond the simple topology, HylP1 is dissimilar to any reported protein structures (all DALI alignments have Z-scores of 1.2), and all primary sequence alignments of significance (E-values 1.7) were also of phage-encoded hyaluronate lyases of S. pyogenes strains. This protein structure is therefore highly unique and highly specialized to S. pyogenes bacteriophage. The fact that there is no structural similarity between the TS H domain of gp5 and gp12 with that of HylP1 and that the bacteriophage that encode these proteins, T4 and SF370.1, respectively, belong to different families suggests that the utilization of this structural element by tail-fiber proteins may be an example of convergent evolution. Indeed, in a topographical, as opposed to topological, sense, HylP1 is more similar to the single-stranded parallel -helices of known carbohydrate-active enzymes such as several pectinases (for example, ref. 38), chondroitinase B (39), and tailspike gp9 (37). These domains are irregular, contain grooves, are catalytically active, and, in the case of gp9, also a component of a noncontractile phage tail.
Catalytic Center of HylP1. Perhaps the single most important difference between HylP1 and TS H domains observed previously is that HylP1 catalysis requires no additional catalytic domains, such as the T4 lysozyme domain appended to gp12 and the bacteriophage K1F endosialidase (Fig. 3b). We have not obtained complex crystals of HylP1, but we are able to provide insight into the regions critical for catalysis. A triple-helical domain-truncated construct, from residues Asn-106­Asp-310, is catalytically active, confirming that the catalytic center resides in the TS H domain itself. The TS H domain provides an extended groove with which to bind long stretches of HA. Every three to four -strands, positively charged Arg or Lys residues protrude into this grove, spaced between 9 and 14 Å apart, consistent with the spacing of the negatively charged glucuronic acid of the alternating GlcA-GlcNAc polymer that is HA (Fig. 4). Closer inspection of the structure of HylP1 revealed

an Asp­Tyr pair (Fig. 3c), Asp-137, Tyr-149 (adjacent to a loop that is disordered in the native structure), reminiscent of similar pairings at the center of structurally unrelated hyaluronate and chondroitin lyases in which the Tyr residues act as the catalytic base for proton abstraction from the C5 of the uronic acid with the Asp involved in pKa maintenance (for example, ref. 40). Tyr-149 is positioned 20 and 60 Å from each end of the TS H, consistent with the location of the active center determined through product analysis. Both D137A and Y149F mutants are completely inactive, whereas CD analysis indicated that there are no significant structural differences between the native and mutant proteins; indeed, the free energies of the folded and unfolded forms of each protein are also very similar at approximately 1 kcal mol 1. We therefore propose that Asp-137 and Tyr-149 have a catalytic function, but given the length of the binding groove, we cannot exclude a solely binding role for these residues. The unique domain-structure of HylP1, viewed in light of the gp12 and gp9 structures, allows speculation on a possible orientation within the phage tail. The N-terminal globular domain of HylP1 resembles the globular collar domain of gp12 (41). The gp12 globular collar domain is adjacent to its receptor-binding domain, located at the C terminus of gp12. HylP1 has no such receptorbinding domain, because the globular domain of HylP1 is at the N terminus of the enzyme. This distinction is important because it does not rule out the possibility that there is another protein linked to HylP1 by means of the N-terminal globular domain, and hence the tail fiber of SF370.1 may not terminate with HylP1. HylP1 is a previously undescribed catalytically active TS H protein. The structure confirms its origins as part of a bacteriophage tail assembly whose function is as an ``enzymatic needle'' that digests the hyaluronic acid capsule during phage invasion of the S. pyogenes host. The role of HylP1 is not efficient hyaluronan degradation per se but efficient reduction of the viscosity of hyaluronan in the immediate vicinity of a single phage particle, to allow phage penetration to the cell wall. HylP1 has therefore recruited an extremely long structural protein whose extended binding surface provides exactly the unusual properties demanded for phage penetration of the capsule. The concave sides of the TS H harness an exceedingly large number of subsites, which both prevent the enzyme from becoming ``side-tracked'' by complete degradation of the hyaluronic acid and help avoid product inhibition. It is particularly significant that the catalytic center resides within the TS H. It had been assumed, at least tacitly, that the TS H domain only provided a structural scaffold onto which catalytic domains were subsequently grafted, as illustrated by the bacteriophage T4 injection apparatus and the E. coli K1 phage-encoded sialidase. The HylP1 structure demonstrates that this assumption is not necessarily the case and suggests that catalytically active TS Hs will exist elsewhere. Given the increasing resistance to conventional antibiotics, we hope that insight into phage-host specificity and infection processes will have an impact on the subsequent design of novel bacteriophage-derived antibiotics.
