ABSTRACT:

Enzymatic modification of aminoglycoside antibiotics mediated by regioselective aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases is the predominant cause of bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides. A recently discovered bifunctional aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC(6)-Ib variant, AAC(6)-Ib-cr) has been shown to catalyze the acetylation of fluoroquinolones as well as aminoglycosides. We have expressed and purified AAC(6)-Ib-wt and its bifunctional variant AAC(6)-Ib-cr in Escherichia coli and characterized their kinetic and chemical mechanism. Initial velocity and dead-end inhibition studies support an ordered sequential mechanism for the enzyme(s). The three-dimensional structure of AAC(6)-Ib-wt was determined in various complexes with donor and acceptor ligands to resolutions greater than 2.2 Å. Observation of the direct, and optimally positioned, interaction between the 6-NH2 and Asp115 suggests that Asp115 acts as a general base to accept a proton in the reaction. The structure of AAC(6)-Ib-wt permits the construction of a molecular model of the interactions of fluoroquinolones with the AAC(6)-Ib-cr variant. The model suggests that a major contribution to the fluoroquinolone acetylation activity comes from the Asp179Tyr mutation, where Tyr179 makes -stacking interactions with the quinolone ring facilitating quinolone binding. The model also suggests that fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides have different binding modes. On the basis of kinetic properties, the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters, and structural information, we propose an acid/base-assisted reaction catalyzed by AAC(6)-Ib-wt and the AAC(6)-Ib-cr variant involving a ternary complex.
(ANTs), and aminoglycoside acetyltransferases (AACs),1 respectively, is the predominant cause of bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides (1-4), whereas drug efflux and target gene mutations are major causes of fluoroquinolone resistance (5-8). Recently, plasmid borne, horizontally transferable, Qnr-mediated target protection has emerged as a new fluoroquinolone resistance mechanism among Gram-negative pathogens worldwide (9-12). Among aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, each class is divided into subtypes based on the regioselectivity of substrate modification. Aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases selectively transfer an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) to one of the several amine functions present in aminoglycosides. There are four major classes of AACs: AAC(1), AAC(3), AAC(2), and AAC(6), designated according to the site of acetylation (1). AAC(6) family members are most common in nature and of particular importance since they modify aminoglycosides most used

Aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones are broad spectrum bactericidal antimicrobial agents that are widely used in the treatment of variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections. They are chemically and structurally distinct compounds that inhibit different but essential cellular functions of bacteria. Aminoglycosides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the A site of 16S rRNA causing misreading and/or hindering of the translocation step, while fluoroquinolones exert their antibacterial activity by interacting with DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV. With the increased usage of these antimicrobials, bacteria have developed a variety of resistance mechanisms to evade their deadly effects.

Vetting et al. supernatant was dialyzed against buffer A, loaded onto a Ni-NTA column preequilibrated with buffer A, and washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with a linear 0-0.3 M imidazole gradient at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated to 5 mL by ultrafiltration. The His6 tag was then cleaved using thrombin (2 units/mg of protein), and the solution was dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 2 mM CaCl2 and loaded onto a Superdex S-75 column preequilibrated with buffer A. Pure fractions as determined by SDS-PAGE were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Protein concentrations were estimated by the Bio-Rad protein assay method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurement of Enzyme ActiVity. Reaction rates were measured spectrophotometrically by following the increase in absorbance at 324 or 412 nm due to the reaction between the free sulfhydryl group of CoASH, generated by the enzyme-catalyzed aminoglycoside/fluoroquinolone acetylating activity, and 4,4-dithiopyridine (DTP) or 5,5-dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB). The reaction was monitored continuously on a UVIKON XL spectrophotometer, and enzyme activities were calculated using a molar absorption coefficient of either 19800 M-1 cm-1 (DTP) or 13600 M-1 cm-1 (DTNB). Assay mixtures contained appropriate buffer, 0.05 mM DTP or 0.1 mM DTNB, in addition to substrates or inhibitors in a volume of 1 mL. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and followed at room temperature for 1-2 min. Initial Velocity Experiments. Initial velocity kinetic data were fitted using Sigma Plot 2000. Kinetic constants for aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin were determined using fixed, saturating conditions of AcCoA. Kinetic constants for AcCoA were determined at fixed, saturating concentrations of kanamycin and ciprofloxacin. Individual substrate saturation kinetic data were fitted to eq 1  ) VA/(A + K) (1)

in chemotherapy (1, 13). The AAC(6) class is further divided into two subtypes of which the AAC(6)-I subtype is most prevalent (1, 14). Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes are generally monofunctional with the exception of a few bifunctional enzymes such as AAC(6)/APH(2), ANT(3)Ii/AAC(6)-IId, and AAC(3)-Ib/AAC(6)-Ib (15-20), all of which modify aminoglycosides. AAC(6)-Ib, the most prevalent aminoglycoside modifying enzyme (13) that confers resistance to tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin, was first identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates in 1986 (21). Since then several variants of this enzyme have been described (13, 22). Recently, we identified an AAC(6)-Ib variant designated as AAC(6)-Ibcr, which contains two unique amino acid substitutions, namely, Trp102Arg and Asp179Tyr, which are not found in other variants. AAC(6)-Ib-cr, unlike other AAC(6)-Ib variants and bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, in addition to acetylating aminoglycosides, also acetylates ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin belonging to an entirely different class of antibacterials and thus provides low-level resistance against these fluoroquinolones (22). In this paper we describe the kinetic characterization of AAC(6)-Ib-cr and its wild-type parent enzyme along with the three-dimensional structure of the wild-type enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. All chemicals, reagents, acetyl-coenzyme A, and aminoglycosides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. Enzymes used in molecular biology were supplied by New England Biolabs. Plasmid pET-28a and Escherichia coli strains Nova Blue and BL21(DE3) were obtained from Novagen. Cloning, OVerexpression, and Purification of AAC(6)-Ibwt and AAC(6)-Ib-cr. The open reading frames of aac(6)Ib-wt (where -wt stands for wild type) and aac(6)-Ib-cr were amplified by standard PCR techniques using as template transconjugant E. coli J53 pHSH10-2 (22). Oligonucleotides AC6F (5- ATCCCGCTCATATGAGTATTCAACATTTC3) and AC6R (5-ATCCCGCTAAGCTTTCACTCCTCTGTTGCCAT-3) containing the underlined NdeI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, were used for aac(6)-Ib, while AC6crF(5-ATCCCGCTGCTAGCAACGCAAAAACAAAG3) and A6CcrR (5-ATCCCGCTAAGCTTTTAGGCATCACTGCGTGTTCG-3) containing the underlined NheI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively, were used for aac(6)Ib-cr. The PCR fragments were cloned into pET-28a(+), and the recombinant AAC(6)-Ib-wt and AAC(6)-Ib-cr bearing a thrombin-cleavable N-terminal His6 tag were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3). For shake flask growth, 1 L of Luria broth medium supplemented with kanamycin (35 µg/ mL) was inoculated with 10 mL of an overnight culture and incubated at 37 °C. The culture was grown to midlog phase (A600  0.8), cooled to 20 °C, induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, and further incubated overnight at 20 °C. All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200g and resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris, pH 7.8, containing 150 mM NaCl) containing protease inhibitors, lysozyme (5 µg/ mL), and DNase I (0.1 µg/mL) and stirred for 20 min. The cells were then lysed by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10000g for 30 min. The

Dead-End Inhibition Patterns. Dead-end inhibition patterns were determined by measuring initial velocities at variable concentrations of one reactant, the second reactant concentration fixed, and the dead-end inhibitors (lividomycin and pefloxacin) at several concentrations. Equations 3 and 4 were used to fit the competitive and uncompetitive inhibition, respectively.  ) VA/[Ka(1 + I/Kis) + A]  ) VA/[Ka + A(1 + I/Kii)] (3) (4)

Bifunctional Aminoglycoside/Fluoroquinolone N-Acetyltransferase Dependence of Acetylation ActiVity on pH. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters exhibited by AAC(6)Ib-wt and AAC(6)-Ib-cr was determined at the saturating concentrations of substrates. Activities were monitored every 0.3 pH unit from pH 4.4 to pH 6.7 for AAC(6)-Ib, from pH 5.2 to pH 7.3 for AAC(6)-Ib-cr for aminoglycoside substrates, and from pH 6.7 to pH 9.1 for fluoroquinolone acetylation using the following buffers: citrate-phosphate (pH 4.4-6.2), MES (pH 5.2-6.6), HEPES (pH 6.7-7.9), and TAPS (pH 7.6-9.1). Profiles were generated by plotting the log of kcat versus the pH and fitted using the equations: log kcat)log[C/(1 + H+/Ka + Kb/H+)] (5)

SolVent Kinetic Isotope Effects. The solvent kinetic isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km were determined by measuring the initial velocities using saturating concentrations of AcCoA while varying the concentrations of either kanamycin B at pH 6.1 or ciprofloxacin at pH 7.8 in either H2O or 95% D2O.

AAC(6)-Ib-wt was crystallized by vapor diffusion under oil. Several commercial crystallization screens were used, resulting in only two crystallization hits, both containing calcium acetate. Optimization of conditions yielded a crystallization solution of 20% PEG 3350, 200 mM calcium acetate, and 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.75. The protein solution (3 µL of a 10 mg/mL, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM NaCl, 3 mM AcCoA) was combined with 3 µL of the crystallization solution under 150 µL of FISHER brand silicone oil in 96well round-bottom plates stored open to room humidity. The crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.25 mm within 7 days, exhibiting bipyramidal morphology. Crystals were soaked for 10 s in 20% PEG 6000, 200 mM calcium acetate, 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.75, and 20% glycerol prior to vitrification by immersion in liquid nitrogen. All data were collected at 100 K using an R-Axis IV++ image plate detector using Cu KR radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R X-ray generator and processed using MOSFLM (23) and SCALA (24). The crystals belong to space group P43212 with approximate unit cell dimensions of a ) b ) 57.3 Å and c ) 148.4 Å. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 55.4%. Phasing and Structure Refinement. The structure of AAC(6)-Ib-wt was determined by SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction). A single crystal was soaked for 20 min in an 8 mM mercury acetate doped solution (20% PEG 6000, 200 mM calcium acetate, and 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.75) and subsequently swept through the cryoprotectant solution (see above) prior to vitrification by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Heavy atom positions and initial phases were determined using PHENIX (25). The majority of the structure was fit to the solvent-flattened SAD

map utilizing the autobuilding program ARP/WARP (26). The remainder of the structure was fit manually using iterative rounds of modeling building within the molecular graphics program COOT (27) followed by refinement against the data using REFMAC (28). Stereochemical parameters for the ligands were calculated using the PRODRG (29) server. The ligands were not added until the final rounds of refinement to minimize model bias. Aminoglycoside Complexes. Single crystals were soaked in 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 20% PEG 6000, 200 mM calcium acetate, and either 5 mM RIB or 10 mM PAR for either 1 h (RIB) or 2 h (PAR). Crystals were then streaked through an identical solution that included 20% glycerol and vitrified by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Ciprofloxacin Model. Manual manipulation of the conformation and docking of ciprofloxacin to AAC(6)-Ib was performed using the molecular graphics program COOT (27) with stereochemical restraints calculated using the PRODRG (29) server. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Substrate Specificities of AAC(6)-Ib-wt and AAC(6)-Ibcr. Initial velocities were determined at the optimum pH (see below) at 8-10 different concentrations of each substrate. The data were plotted by nonlinear, least-squares curve fitting using Sigmaplot (version 2000). Kinetic constants for AcCoA, determined at saturating concentrations of kanamycin B and ciprofloxacin, are presented in Table 1. The steadystate kinetic parameters for aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones at saturating concentrations of AcCoA are also summarized in Table 1. From the determined steady-state kinetic parameters, particularly the relative V/K values, AcCoA was the strongly preferred acyl donor while other coenzyme A derivatives were either extremely poor substrates or did not demonstrate any activity (data not shown). AAC(6)-Ib-wt exhibited somewhat broader specificity with respect to aminoglycosides when compared to AAC(6)-Ib-cr. Among 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides (Figure S1), kanamycin B was the best substrate (Table 1) while tobramycin and kanamycin A exhibited very similar values. Among 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides, neomycin B exhibited significant activity, while ribostamycin was a poor substrate (data not shown).

Another 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside, lividomycin A that contains a 6-hydroxyl group, was a good inhibitor of AAC(6)-Ib and was used in dead-end inhibition studies. Substrate specificities for AAC(6)-Ib-cr were somewhat different. Similar to AAC(6)-Ib-wt, AcCoA was the strongly preferred acyl donor. Surprisingly, the V/K value of AcCoA increased 15-fold for AAC(6)-Ib-cr due to both increases in kcat and a decreased Km value (Table 1). The V/KAcCoA for fluoroquinolone acetylation, however, was about 100-fold lower compared to aminoglycoside acetylation. Substrate specificity for kanamycin decreased by a modest 10-fold when compared to wild type, while neomycin B exhibited extremely low activity that could not be measured with certainty. Among the fluoroquinolones tested, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin exhibited acetylating activity (Table 1) while tosulfloxacin exhibited very low but measurable activity (data not shown). Fluoroquinolones that contain one or more substituents on the carbon atoms adjacent to piperazinyl nitrogen (gatifloxacin and sparfloxacin) were not acetylated by AAC(6)-Ib-cr while pefloxacin, which contains a substituted piperazinyl nitrogen, was an inhibitor of AAC(6)Ib-cr. The catalytic efficiency of fluoroquinolone acetylation was about 50 times lower compared to kanamycin. Kinetic Mechanism. The initial velocity pattern for AAC(6)Ib-cr was determined using both ciprofloxacin and AcCoA (Figure 1) and kanamycin and AcCoA (data not shown). The resultant double-reciprocal plots were intersecting. The intersecting initial velocity plots suggest a sequential kinetic mechanism, where both substrates must be bound to the enzyme for catalysis to occur. A sequential kinetic mechanism could proceed through either ordered or random addition of substrates. Dead-end inhibitors are powerful tools in determining the order of substrate additions. Dead-end inhibition studies were carried out using both fluoroquinolone (pefloxacin) and aminoglycoside (lividomycin A) inhibitors (Figure 1, Table 2). Lividomycin A displayed linear competitive inhibition versus both kanamycin and ciprofloxacin and uncompetitive inhibition versus AcCoA (Figure 1). Similarly, pefloxacin exhibited linear competitive inhibition versus both kanamycin and norfloxacin and uncompetitive inhibition versus AcCoA (Table 2). These data are consistent with the ordered addition of AcCoA followed by aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone. In addition, Kim et al. have recently reported an ordered sequential kinetic mechanism (where AcCoA binds first) for an AAC(6)-Ib variant, namely, AAC(6)-Ib from a bifunctional AAC(3)-Ib/AAC(6)Ib based on their dead-end and product inhibition studies (15). AAC(6)-Ib-wt has an additional 15 residues at the N-terminus compared to the AAC(6)-Ib variant described by Kim et al. (15). AAC(6)-Ib-wt also has two conservative amino acid substitutions, L2V and V26L, compared to AAC(6)-Ib. AAC(6)-Ib-wt and AAC(6)-Ib exhibit similar kinetic properties on overlapping substrates tested for both enzymes. However, the pH ranges of their optimal activities differ significantly. The optimum pH for aminoglycoside acetylation by AAC(6)-Ib-wt is 5.6 while AAC(6)-Ib has an optimal pH of around 7.5 (15) where AAC(6)-Ib-wt exhibits less than 5% of its maximal activity. Well over 50 unique AACs have been identified among bacteria (1, 13), and several AACs have been subjected to the analysis of their kinetic mechanisms (15, 19, 30-35). The majority of the AACs studied to date use a random sequential mechanism

while a few others, including AAC(6)-Ib, use an ordered sequential mechanism (15, 19, 35). Studies of solvent kinetic isotope effects can be a useful tool in the determination of rate-limiting nature of the chemical reaction and the kinetic mechanism, especially to distinguish between steady-state and rapid equilibrium mechanisms. In a rapid equilibrium kinetic mechanism, the rates of substrate binding and product dissociation are very fast relative to the catalytic step, and equivalent isotope effects must be observed on V and V/K. This is not a requirement for the steady-state mechanism. Solvent kinetic isotope effects for kanamycin B and ciprofloxacin acetylation were determined at pH 6.0 and 7.7, respectively, in both H2O and

95% D2O, a region where small changes in pH(D) did not have any effect on kinetic parameters (see below). Reactions were performed at fixed, saturating concentrations of AcCoA and at varying concentrations of the second substrate. The solvent kinetic isotope effects on V were 1.38 ( 0.03 and 1.78 ( 0.05 for kanamycin B and ciprofloxacin, respectively (Figure 2). The solvent kinetic isotope effects on V/Kkanamycin B and V/Kciprofloxacin were 1.28 ( 0.05 and 1.17 ( 0.04, respectively (Figure 2). The very low values of the solvent kinetic isotope effects on V/K suggest that both kanamycin and ciprofloxacin are kinetically "sticky" and that no slow, solvent isotopically sensitive step occurs between kanamycin B/ciprofloxacin binding and the first irreversible step, generally assumed to be the release of the first product. The larger values of the solvent kinetic isotope effects on V, which includes steps from the precatalytic ternary complex through final product release, may reflect the effects of solvent isotopic substitution on the chemical step, the release of products, or the conformational changes that allow this to occur. The magnitude of the solvent kinetic isotope effects and inequality of D2OV and D2OV/K argues against a rapid equilibrium mechanism where the chemical step is rate limiting. pH Profile. AAC(6)-Ib-wt exhibited an optimum pH of 5.6, while the pH optima for AAC(6)-Ib-cr were 6.1 and 7.7 for aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone acetylating activities, respectively. The kcat pH activity profiles of the reactions catalyzed by AAC(6)-Ib-wt and AAC(6)-Ib-cr were bell shaped (Figure S2). The kcat pH profile of AAC(6)Ib-cr for aminoglycoside acetylation suggests the involvement of two groups exhibiting pKa values of 5.62 ( 0.06 and 6.84 ( 0.07 whose ionization is critical for catalytic activity. In the case of fluoroquinolone acetylation AAC(6)Ib-cr, however, the kcat pH profile reveals that the pKa values have shifted to 7.08 ( 0.04 and 8.40 ( 0.05. Such a shift of pKa values in kcat profile could be due to the formation of

the enzyme-substrate complex and/or solvent perturbation (36). Binding of aminoglycosides to AAC(6)-Ib-wt is coordinated through several hydrogen-bonding interactions at the active site (see below). The catalytic base Asp115 is involved in two hydrogen-bonding interactions with the aminoglycosides including one with a 6-NH2 group where chemistry occurs. Modeling of the potential fluoroquinolone interactions in the active site based on the structural information from AAC(6)-Ib-wt-AcCoA-aminoglycoside ternary complex (see below) suggests that the fluoroquinolone binding is facilitated by several stacking interactions instead of the numerous hydrogen-bonding interactions that coordinate aminoglycoside binding. This difference in binding interactions between the enzyme and the two substrates may account for the differences in the pK values observed for the catalytic groups. OVerall Fold. The structure of AAC(6)-Ib-wt in complex with CoA and kanamycin B was recently published (37); however, the coordinates were not available at the start of this work. The structure of AAC(6)-Ib-wt presented here was determined by SAD (single-wavelength anomalous diffraction) utilizing a single mercury derivative collected on a rotating anode source (Table 3). AAC(6)-Ib is composed of 199 residues and has been determined to be a monomer in solution (37). The N-terminal 20 residues are not visible in electron density maps. A construct truncated to Asp21, the first residue visible in AAC(6)-Ib-wt electron density maps, was as active as full-length AAC(6)-Ib-wt (data not shown), and Asp21 is 25 Å from the binding site of aminoglycoside on the opposite side of the -sheet, suggesting the N-terminus is not important for catalysis. The structure is similar to the mixed R fold of other members of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family (38). The core -sheet is composed of seven predominately antiparallel -strands ( 4- 5 parallel), with R1 and R2 interacting with one face and R3, R4, and R5 interacting with

the opposite face of the -sheet (Figure 3). The -sheet has the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, and there is a disruption of the -strand interactions between 4 and 5 giving the -sheet a V-like appearance. There does not appear to be any large global structural differences (rmsd of 0.33 Å over 177 common CR) between the structure of the previously determined AAC(6)-Ib-CoA-kanamycin B complex (37) and the AAC(6)-Ib-AcCoA-kanamycin C complex determined here. AcCoA Binding Site. AcCoA binds to AAC(6)-Ib-wt in a fashion similar to that observed previously with other members of the GNAT superfamily (38). The majority of the adenosine 3,5-disphosphate moiety is solvent exposed with the 3-phosphate coordinated by the side chains of Arg162 and Lys166 and the adenine and ribose rings forming nonpolar interactions with R4 (Figure 3, Figure S3A). The 5-diphosphate (pyrophosphate) interacts substantially with the N-terminal dipole of helix R3 and the 2/R3 loop, forming five direct and one solvent-mediated hydrogen bond

with seven main chain backbone atoms and one side chain atom (Thr130OG1). The pantothenate of AcCoA takes a C-shape as it enters a tunnel formed by the interactions of R1 with R4, with the bend occurring as the pantothenate interacts with the side chain and main chain of Trp48 on R3. The C-shape is also guided by the interactions of the "peptide-like" character of the pantothenate/ -mercaptoethylene moiety with 4, forming a " -sheet-like" interaction. The availability of the main chain atoms of 4 to exogenous ligands is due to the "splaying" of 4 from 5 disrupting the -sheet. While most likely encoded by the entire structure, the maintenance of the 4/ 5 disruption in AAC(6)-Ib-wt may in part be due to two proline residues (Pro153, Pro155), preventing an extension of the 5 strand. There was clear electron density for the acetyl group of AcCoA with the carbonyl hydrogen bonded to the backbone nitrogen of Gln116 and essentially coplanar with the plane of the central -sheet (Figure 4). Aminoglycoside Binding Site. Interestingly, in the AAC(6)Ib-wt-AcCoA complex there was additional electron density in the acceptor binding pocket despite the fact that only AcCoA was included in the crystallization conditions (Figure 4A). This electron density was consistent with a 4,6disubstituted deoxystreptamine ring and could be successfully fit as kanamycin presumably originating from the expression conditions (60 µM kanamycin) and retained during purification on Ni-NTA agarose chromatography. In this complex, the 6-polar group is approximately 2.2 Å from the re face of the thioester, suggesting that if the 6-substituent were a primary amine, that turnover should have occurred yielding acetylated aminoglycoside and CoA. There are two possible explanations for the observation of both an acceptor and donor molecule occurring in the active site with no turnover. The enzyme may not be active in the solid state, with perhaps the lack of enzyme motion or correctly positioned active site residues preventing turnover, or the acceptor molecule is actually an inhibitor rather than a substrate. The kanamycin used in expression was kanamycin sulfate purified from

Streptomyces kanamyceticus (SIGMA K1377). Commercial kanamycin purified from producing organisms contains predominately kanamycin A but also contains small amounts of kanamycins B and C (39, 40). The 6-polar substituent on kanamycins A and B is an amine while on kanamycin C it is a hydroxyl group. To discern between these two possibilities, an additional two AAC(6)-Ib-wt complexes were attempted by soaking crystals with the 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycosides ribostamycin (RIB) and paromomycin (PAR). 4,5-Disubstituted aminoglycosides were chosen because they would provide clear evidence for displacement of the bound 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycoside. In the case of the AAC(6)-Ib-wt-RIB and -PAR complexes, the data clearly demonstrate an exchange of the 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside which followed along during purification with the 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycoside which was used to soak the crystals. In the case of the ribostamycin complex where the 6-polar group is a primary amine, the data show clear electron density for CoA and unacetylated ribostamycin (Figure 4B). This is the expected result if the AAC(6)-Ibwt crystals were catalytically competent, and ribostamycin was in great excess to AcCoA (RIB 5 mM, AcCoA none

added in soak). In contrast, the 6-polar group of paromomycin is a hydroxyl, and the data show clear electron density for AcCoA and unacetylated paromomycin with rings I-III in a similar conformation as seen in the AAC(6)-Ib-wtribostamycin complex (Figure 4C). The AAC(6)-Ib-wt-PAR complex demonstrates that AAC(6)-Ib-wt can bind aminoglycosides with 6-OH groups in a catalytically favorable conformation but does not possess the catalytic active site groups to promote the more difficult acetylation of a hydroxyl group. The ribostamycin and paromomycin complexes suggest that the aminoglycoside which remained bound during purification was kanamycin C, originating from the expression media, and as such this presumption was used in the final rounds of refinement of that data set. The binding of kanamycin C to AAC(6)-Ib is essentially identical to that observed in the published structure of AAC(6)-Ib to CoA and kanamycin B (37). The aminoglycoside binding site is constructed as a box with -strands 2, 3, and 4 as the base and the 3- 4 loop with R1, R2, R2, 6, 7 and their intervening loops as the walls (Figure 3). Aminoglycoside rings I and II are bound by narrow constrictions of the active site, while rings III and

9832 Biochemistry, Vol. 47, No. 37, 2008 IV interact with a more open surface depression. In the kanamycin C complex, rings I and III bind perpendicular to the -sheet, while ring II is parallel (Figure 4D). In the paromomycin and ribostamycin complex rings II and III are parallel to the -sheet, while rings I and IV are perpendicular. There are no large-scale structural rearrangements or conformational changes between the three complex structures. The AAC(6)-Ib-wt-RIB and AAC(6)-Ib-wt-PAR structures exhibit rmsds of 0.35 and 0.33 Å with the AAC(6)Ib-wt-KAN complex over 175 common CRs. The largest deviations occur away from catalytically important residues and involve interactions with rings III and IV. The 3/ 4 loop takes a different conformation in the kanamycin C complex versus the 4,5-disubstituted aminoglycoside complexes. In the kanamycin C complex, ring III is directed at the 3/ 4 loop, and there is a peptide flip of residues Leu96 and Ser98 that permits optimization of the interaction between the backbone carbonyl of Ser98 with the 3-NH3 and the side chain of Asp100 with the 3-NH3 and 4-OH. In the ribostamycin and paromomycin complexes, the aminoglycoside is directed away from the 3/ 4 loop and Asp100 points in the opposite direction toward solvent. There are minor shifts in the positioning of the R2/ 2 loop, which appears directed by the interaction of Glu73 with rings III and IV. The side chain of Glu73 takes different conformations in all three complexes, making 0, 1, and 3 interactions with the ribostamycin, kanamycin C, and paromomycin complexes, respectively. Finally, there is weak electron density for residues 51-54 (R1-R2 loop) that was only sufficient in the AAC(6)-Ib-wt-RIB complex to build a model. Ribostamycin, however, makes no direct contacts with residues from this loop, and therefore its ordering is most likely due to longer order solvation effects. The interactions with the rings get fewer in number and appear to be less specific from ring II to ring IV. Ring II is the most buried ring and has the lowest average B-factors (PAR, 12.5 Å2), followed by ring I (PAR, 17.5 Å2), then ring III and IV (PAR, 25.1 and 34.1 Å2). There are a total of eight acidic side chains, which are scattered throughout the acceptor binding cavity and no compensating basic side chains, making the active site very negatively charged, ideal for attracting and interacting with positively charged aminoglycosides (Figure 4E, Figures S3B and S4A,B). The structure suggests that Asp115 and Asp152 are the most critical acidic residues in the active site, with Asp115 and Asp152 forming buried ionic interactions with the 6-NH2 and 3-NH2 of aminoglycoside rings I and II and Asp115 positioned to act as a proton acceptor during catalysis (see below). Three tryptophan residues make significant contributions to the active site. The side chains of Trp49 (R1-R2 loop) and Trp102 ( 3- 4 loop) make stacking interactions with rings I and II, respectively, and the side chain of Trp103 makes a direct hydrogen bond with the 1-NH3 of ring II (Figure 5A). The stacking interactions are optimized by rings I and II being in the chair conformation with the amino and hydroxyl substituents in the equatorial positions giving the rings a flat structure. On the opposite face of the ring IITrp102 stacking is a second stacking arrangement with Tyr93, which is enhanced by the interaction of the 1-NH2 with the aromatic  system. The structure therefore suggests that the acceptor binding site has a high-affinity binding site for the structural feature

Vetting et al. which is identical in all commonly used aminoglycosides, a central 2-deoxystreptamine ring (ring II), and an arrangement of aromatic side chains whose planar surfaces are ideal for interacting with the chair conformation of rings I and II and their 1,4 linkage. In addition, the narrow and more specific binding site for rings I and II opens into a more expansive and flexible surface groove with several potential polar handles, a structure that is consistent with the ability of AAC(6)-Ib-wt to bind and acetylate a wide variety of aminoglycosides with 6-NH2 groups. Enzyme Mechanism. AAC(6)-Ib-wt could catalyze the transfer of the acetyl group directly to the 6-NH2 or indirectly through a covalent enzyme-acyl intermediate. AAC(6)-Ibwt has a single cysteine, Cys163, located in the middle of R3, with its side chain pointing toward the AcCoA binding site. Its thiol group, however, is over 11 Å from the acceptor binding site and is unlikely to participate in catalysis. A Cys163Ala mutant resulted in expressing cells that retained resistance to amikacin and kanamycin (41). The structure of the AAC(6)-Ib-wt ternary complexes with AcCoA and aminoglycosides with a 6-OH substituent clearly support a direct transfer mechanism (Figures 4 and 5). In these complexes the 6-OH polar group is 2.2 (KANC) and 2.7 Å (PAR) from the re face of the acetyl group and in ideal geometry for direct transfer. In addition, these structures suggest that Asp115, which is directly interacting with the 6-group, could act as a general base to accept a proton during the reaction mechanism. E. coli carrying a plasmid encoded AAC(6)-Ib-wt with the corresponding aspartate mutated to an alanine lost the aminoglycoside resistance phenotype (42). The backbone amide of Asn116 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl group of AcCoA, and its partial positive charge could assist in polarization of the carbonyl group to stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate. A semiconserved tyrosine among GNAT enzymes, Tyr164, located on R3 could potentially act as an active site acid to protonate the sulfhydryl of CoA. There is great debate, however, on the role of this particular residue, and it is not always conserved among GNATs. For example, the mutation of the related tyrosine to a phenylalanine in serotonin acetyltransferase led to a 290-fold reduction in kcat (43). Studies of the mutation of the same residue in AAC(6)-Ii to an alanine were found not to be consistent with this tyrosine acting as a general acid (44). In contrast to the observations with the serotonin acetyltransferase structures, Tyr164 is not hydrogen bonded to the thiolate of CoA. In AAC(6)-Ib-wt the side chain of Tyr164 is pulled toward 4 and away from the sulfhydryl (4.1 Å OH-S) by the interaction of the phenolic hydroxyl of Tyr164 with the side chain of Gln116 and is actually much closer to the carbonyl oxygen of AcCoA (3.0 Å). One possibility is that the deformation of the acetyl group toward tetrahedral geometry during the reaction disrupts the Tyr164-Gln116 interaction or displaces the sulfhydryl of CoA down toward Tyr164 such that Tyr164 can act as a general acid. A second distinct possibility is that a number of water molecules (6-8) directly adjacent to the 6-NH3 could function to shuttle a proton from bulk solvent to protonate the sulfhydryl of CoA in a pocket bordered by R3 and 7. The bell-shaped pH curve suggests that the protonation states of two protein groups are important for catalysis, with the most likely candidates being Asp115 and Tyr164.

Trp102Arg/Asp179Tyr Mutation. Attempts to crystallize the AAC(6)-Ib-cr double mutant were unsuccessful; however, the structural determination of the AAC(6)-Ib-wt ternary complexes permits modeling of the potential effects of the mutations on the binding site for fluoroquinolones. Asp179 is located on the 6/ 7 loop, and its side chain interacts with aminoglycoside at one or two points through water molecules. Trp102 is located on the 3/ 4 loop, and its side chain forms stacking interactions with ring II of bound aminoglycosides and has packing interactions with the side chains of Pro178 and Asp179 of the 6/ 7 loop. The molecular model was created with several restrictions implied by the data. Since the mutant protein retained significant activity against aminoglycosides, the altered side chains should enhance the binding of fluoroquinolones while not interfering with binding of aminoglycosides. The fluoroquinolone should be positioned such that the amino nitrogen of its piperazinyl substituent should be in a position to attack the re face of the AcCoA acetyl group yet still allow access of Asp115 to act as the general base. The geometry of attack and the planarity of fluoroquinolones necessitate that the plane of the fluoroquinolone be nearly perpendicular to the re face of AcCoA; therefore, the fluoroquinolone cannot interact with many of the structural features utilized in coordinating aminoglycosides, the gly-

cosidic linkages of which permit significant deviations from perpendicularity to the re face in rings II, II, and IV. In the final AAC(6)-Ib-cr ciprofloxacin model, the amino nitrogen of its piperazinyl moiety is 2.7 Å from Asp115 and the re face of the AcCoA acetyl group. The faces of the fluoroquinolone make stacking interactions with the 6/ 7 and R1R2 loops, the cyclopropyl moiety faces out into solvent, and the fluoro, carbonyl, and carboxylate moieties face the aminoglycoside binding pocket (Figure 6). On the R1-R2 loop, Trp49 makes interactions with the piperazinyl substituent and/or with the fluorobenzyl portion of the quinolone ring similar to those of Trp49 with ring I of aminoglycoside. Gly50-Ala54 are a region of high flexibility such that Gly50 and Gly51 can form productive van der Waal interactions with the face of the pyridinone ring of the quinolone. On the 6/ 7 loop, the side chain of Asp179 is unlikely to provide positive interactions with the quinolone ring. A tyrosine at this position, in the same rotomer position, would provide a significantly better interaction due to -stacking of the p-orbitals of the tyrosine and quinolone rings. Asp179 is located adjacent to the surface such that the Asp179Tyr side chain could adopt several different rotomers, and residue 49 is most likely critical to stabilizing the proper rotomer of residue 179. In the case of the Trp102Arg mutation the guanidinium group of the arginine can make a perpendicular

-cation interaction with the tyrosine face opposite the quinolone holding it in a productive rotomer. The conformations of the side chains in the mutations would not adversely affect the binding of aminoglycosides, as the side chain of Tyr179 fills a void adjacent to the aminoglycoside, and Arg102 occupies the same space as the Trp and can replicate the stacking interactions with the ring II of aminoglycoside. The model therefore suggests that the Asp179Tyr mutation is responsible for the increase in the affinity of AAC(6)Ib-cr for fluoroquinolones and that the Trp102Arg mutation stabilizes the correct rotomer of the tyrosine while maintaining the productive interactions between the 6/ 7 and 3/ 4 loops. This model is further supported by the fact that the Asp179Tyr mutant alone conferred a 2-fold rise in the MIC of ciprofloxacin and the two mutations together (Asp179Tyr and Trp102Arg) conferred a 3-4-fold rise (22). Maurice et al. (37) report an alternate hypothesis for the binding of fluoroquinolones to AAC(6)-Ib-cr which utilized molecular dynamics and a bound HEPES molecule as a starting point. In their model they propose a similar interaction of the Asp179Tyr mutation with the fluoroquinolone, although they propose the fluoroquinolone binds in same position as aminoglycosides and with the Trp102Arg mutation interacting with the fluoroquinolone carboxylate. The model presented here requires less structural rearrangement and places the secondary amine of the fluoroquinolone in more conducive geometry to form a ternary complex with clear access to Asp115, the active site base. However, we cannot rule out that the structural plasticity of AAC(6)-Ib demonstrated in the Maurice paper could facilitate their

proposed binding mode for fluoroquinolones and suggest both models are equally valid. The mechanism elucidated here further highlights the adaptive potential of AACs that in this case is presumably driven by the selective pressures of fluoroquinolone use. Surveys of clinical isolates of enteric bacteria from around the world have reported the cr allele of aac(6)-Ib that in several studies now constitutes a quarter or more of all alleles of aac(6)-Ib (22, 52, 53). That alleles encoding only single mutations of Asp179Tyr or Trp102Arg have not been reported also supports the importance of the enzyme stabilizing role of Trp102Arg in allowing Asp179Tyr to promote ciprofloxacin positioning and catalysis, as elucidated in the structural model.
