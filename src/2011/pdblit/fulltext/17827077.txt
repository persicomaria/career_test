Abstract Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides to 2V -deoxyribonucleotides and thereby provides the precursors needed for both synthesis and repair of DNA. In the recent years, many new crystal structures have been obtained of the protein subunits of all three classes of RNR. This review will focus upon recent structural and spectroscopic studies, which have offered deeper insight to the mechanistic properties as well as evolutionary relationship and diversity among the different classes of RNR. Although the three different classes of RNR enzymes depend on different metal cofactors for the catalytic activity, all three classes have a conserved cysteine residue at the active site located on the tip of a protein loop in the centre of an a/h-barrel structural motif. This cysteine residue is believed to be converted into a thiyl radical that initiates the substrate turnover in all three classes of RNR. The functional and structural similarities suggest that the present-day RNRs have all evolved from a common ancestral reductase. Nevertheless, the different cofactors found in the three classes of RNR make the RNR proteins into interesting model systems for quite diverse protein families, such as diiron-oxygen proteins, cobalamin-dependent proteins, and SAM-dependent iron ­ sulfur proteins. There are also significant variations within each of the three classes of RNR. With new structures available of the R2 protein of class I RNR, we have made a comparison of the diiron centres in R2 from mouse and Escherichia coli. The R2 protein shows dynamic carboxylate, radical, and water shifts in different redox forms, and new radical forms are different from non-radical forms. In mouse R2, the binding of iron(II) or cobalt(II) to the four metal sites shows high cooperativity. A unique situation is found in RNR from baker's yeast, which is made up of heterodimers, in contrast to homodimers, which is the normal case for class I RNR. Since the reduction of ribonucleotides is the rate-limiting step of DNA synthesis, RNR is an important target for cell growth control, and the recent finding of a p53-induced isoform of the R2 protein in mammalian cells has increased the interest for the role of RNR during the different phases of the cell cycle.

1. Introduction Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of the four standard ribonucleotides, 5V -di(or tri)-phospho -adenosine, -cytidine, -guanosine, and -uridine, to their 2V -deoxyribonucleotide counterparts and thereby provides the precursors needed for both synthesis and repair of DNA. The review will describe recent studies; please examine earlier reviews for basic information about the RNR [1­ 7]. One of the products, 5V -di(tri)phospho 2V deoxyuridine, needs to be converted into thymidine before it

can be used for DNA synthesis, in a process catalysed by the enzyme thymidylate synthase [8]. As all known cellular life forms store their genetic information as DNA, RNR is likely to be found in all growing cells of every living organism, a fact that is confirmed by a rapidly increasing number of genomic screenings [9]. Even several species of viruses carry their own copy of RNR, probably to ensure faster proliferation in the infected host cell. Three main classes of RNR enzymes have been discovered that depend on different metal cofactors for the catalytic activity (Table 1) [10]: class I enzymes contain a diiron-oxygen cluster [11], class II a cobalt containing cobalamin cofactor (vitamin B12), and there is an 4Fe ­4S iron ­ sulfur cluster coupled to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in class III. Despite these differences, all three classes have a

conserved cysteine residue at the active site that is converted into a thiyl radical. This thiyl radical is believed to initiate the substrate turnover by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the ribose ring of the substrate [5,7]. With the latest structural information, it has become evident that the thiyl radical site is located on the tip of a protein loop in the centre of an a/h-barrel in all three classes of RNR (Fig. 1) [12 ­14]. These functional and structural similarities suggest that the present-day RNRs have all evolved form a common ancestral reductase [15 ­ 17]. However, only in class II, the metal cofactor may interact directly with the active site cysteine, whereas in class I and III, a stable protein radical is generated on a separate site, and the radical state is transferred to the active site by way of a radical transfer pathway consisting of a chain of hydrogen bonded amino acid residues. Table 2 represents the list of X-ray structures of RNR that have been deposited in the Brookhaven protein databank, as well as other crystal structures that are described in the literature. This list includes structures of RNR from several organisms, both wild type and mutants, in different oxidation states, and containing different cofactors. The information obtained from these structures has been essential for the functional description of the different RNRs, which will be reviewed in the following sections. This review will focus upon recent structural and spectroscopic studies of RNR which have offered deeper insight to the mechanistic properties and evolutionary relationship, and diversity among the different classes of RNR. The different cofactors found in the three classes of RNR make the RNR proteins into interesting model systems for several different classes of proteins: (1) radical proteins, and especially, radical transfer proteins such as photosystem II, prostaglandin H synthase, galactose oxidase, cytochrome c oxidase and many more [5,18]; (2) diiron-oxygen proteins [11,19­ 26], which include the hydroxylase component of

soluble methane monooxygenase (MMOH), D9 stearoylacyl carrier protein desaturase, hemerythrin, and purple acid phosphatase; (3) cobalamin-dependent proteins including methionine synthase and glutamate mutase [27 ­30]; and (4) SAM-dependent iron ­ sulfur proteins [31 ­ 33], such as pyruvate formate-lyase, biotin synthase, lipoate synthase, spore photoproduct lyase, and tRNA sulfur-transferases. Since the reduction of ribonucleotides is the rate-limiting step of DNA synthesis, RNR is an important target for cell growth control, and several RNR inhibitors are being used, or have been proposed, as drugs for chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer in combination with other drugs [34,35] and a range of infections, such as malaria [36] and AIDS [37].

2. Structure and mechanism of the three classes of RNR 2.1. The three classes of RNR As described above, RNR has been divided into three main classes based on their different utilization of metal cofactors (see Table 1) [10]. In many bacteria, e.g. Escherichia coli, two or even three different classes of RNR coexist in the genome, and they can be expressed depending on the present environment of the bacterium; in some cases even concomitantly, as has been observed in Pseudomonas species [38]. In higher organisms, only class I RNR is found, however, different isoforms of the protein subunits of RNR have been observed in mammalian cells [39]. 2.1.1. Class I Class I enzymes are oxygen-dependent, and are found in practically all eukaryotic organisms, from yeast and algae to plants and mammals, and some prokaryotes and viruses also express this type. Class I is further divided into two subclasses, Ia and Ib, based on polypeptide

The common cysteine radical sites are indicated, and the relative positions of the different radical generation systems in the three classes are indicated by the last tyrosines of the radical transfer pathway for class I, the B12-derivative adenosylcobalamin for class II (magenta sphere: cobalt), and the glycyl radical site for class III (cyan sphere). The lower figure shows the similarity of the substrate-binding domain of the three classes of RNR, the 10-stranded a/h-barrel.

sequence homologies and their overall allosteric regulation behaviour [40]. Class Ia exists in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, viruses, and bacteriophages, while Ib has only been found in prokaryotes. Class I RNRs are tetrameric enzymes (a2h2) [2]. The substrate binding active site is located in the large a2homodimer which is called R1 in class Ia, encoded by nrdA, and R1E in class Ib, encoded by nrdE. The small h2-homodimer contains a binding site for two iron ions in each polypeptide chain and is called R2 in class Ia, encoded by nrdB, and R2F for the class Ib, encoded by nrdF. In the active form, these R2 proteins contain a stable tyrosyl radical close to the iron centres, and the iron centres are found in the diferric state with a A-oxo bridge. The unusual subunit composition in the class Ia RNR from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aaV hhV (see Section

3.3) [41], where only one of the R2 subunits (h) can harbour a diiron centre, suggests that class Ia could also be divided into two subclasses, Ia1 and Ia2. However, the situation in S. cerevisiae seems to be quite exceptional, since even closely related yeast strains, such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe [42], do not express this type of heterodimers. For mammalian RNR, the mouse enzyme might be the best model since there are a number of significant differences between the E. coli enzyme and RNR in higher organisms [11]. The sequence identity between the mouse R2 and the E. coli R2 is only 19%, whereas there is 50%, or higher, identity among the eukaryotic R2 proteins [11,43,44]. For class Ib, the enzyme from Salmonella typhimurium is regarded as the prototype [40].

2.1.2. Class II Class II enzymes are found in bacteria that can live under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and also in some of their phages. The gene encoding this protein has been termed nrdJ or RTPR. The prototype from this class has been the monomeric enzyme from Lactobacillus leichmannii, but as more and more members of this class have been found that are predominately homodimers, the Lactobacillus enzyme seems to be rather an extreme of the class [9]. They all, however, utilize a cobaltous cofactor, adenosylcobalamin, a vitamin B12 derivative, that interacts directly with an active site cysteine to form the reactive cysteine radical needed for ribonucleotide reduction. 2.1.3. Class III Class III enzymes [32] are found in strict, or facultative, anaerobic bacteria and some bacteriophages. The enzyme from bacteriophage T4 consists of two subunits where the larger a2 subunit, encoded by nrdD, contains the active and allosteric sites [12]. The smaller h2 subunit, encoded by nrdG, is also called the activase and carries a 4Fe ­4S iron ­ sulfur cluster that reacts with SAM and generates a glycyl radical in the large subunit. This glycyl radical is believed to generate a cysteine radical at the active site when the right set of allosteric activators and substrate is bound. In the class III active site, there are only two cysteines, so that the turnover reaction has to be different than in I and II [45,46]. Instead of two cysteines being oxidized into a disulfide bridge, a formate is oxidized to carbon dioxide [47]. 2.2. Structural similarities Over the last few years, the crystal structures of the active site subunits of all three classes of RNR have been solved; first, the R1 subunit of class I RNR from E. coli in 1994 [13], then the class III protein from Bacteriophage T4 [12,48], and finally, the seminal finding of the monomeric class II protein from L. leichmannii, which was crystallized as an apo enzyme, as well as in complex with the vitamin B12 analogue adeninylpentylcobalamin [14]. A structure of a dimeric class II RNR from Thermotoga maritima is also in

progress (K.-M. Larsson, P. Nordlund, personal communication). The latest published structure is the class Ib R1E from S. typhimurium [49]. Together, these structures now allow us to make detailed comparisons of the substrate binding sites and allosteric sites, providing better insight into the reaction mechanisms and the strictly controlled substrate specificity. At a first glance, the structures of the three classes of RNR reveal that in spite of the very low sequence homology--less than 10% based on sequence alignment, the overall folding of the active sites is remarkably similar (Figs. 1 and 2). The global fold is composed of a core of a 10-stranded a/h-barrel; see Fig. 1. The barrel contains two parallel five-stranded h-sheets oriented in an antiparallel fashion. The centre of the barrel contains a prototypical RNR ``finger loop'' consisting of two antiparallel h-strands, with the putative thiyl radical being generated on a conserved cysteine residue at the ``fingertip'', C439 in class Ia R1 from E. coli, C388 in class Ib R1E from S. typhimurium, C408 in class II from L. leichmannii, and C290 in class III from bacteriophage T4 (Fig. 2). The class I and II RNR structures, however, are more similar to one another than either is to the class III structure. All the key active site residues in class I and II RNR are structurally conserved, including the general acid/base catalyst E441 and its hydrogen-bonding partner N437, and the redox active disulfide C225 ­ C462 (corresponding to residue, E410, N406, and C119 ­C419 in L. leichmannii, respectively). Active site residues that are structurally conserved between class II and III RNRs include C79, the putative redox-active equivalent of C225 from E. coli class I RNR and C119 from L. leichmannii class II RNR. There are no obvious amino acid substitutions that explain the preference of the class II enzyme for tri-instead of diphosphate substrates. The substrate phosphate-binding region resembles each other very closely for class II L. leichmannii and class I E. coli RNR. The large similarity of the catalytic domains among the three classes of RNR suggests that the reaction mechanism must be very similar, despite the low sequence homology and the very different aerobic environments where these enzymes are active. In the following, a brief summary of the current views on the mechanisms is presented, and a

summary of the roles of the conserved cysteine residues will also be given. 2.3. The catalytic cycle of class I RNR 2.3.1. Active cysteines in R1 The involvement of cysteine residues in the reduction of ribonucleotides was first recognized by Thelander in 1974 [50] who showed that one disulfide bridge is formed for each ribonucleotide reduced, and that two ribonucleotides can be reduced by the fully reduced protein in the absence of external reductants, indicating the involvement of two disulfide bridges in the active monomer of R1 class Ia RNR from E. coli. Later, these two cysteine pairs were identified by the combination of genomic sequencing [51,52], thiol-labelling experiments

[53], site-directed mutagenesis [54 ­ 57], and finally the crystal structure [13]. One cysteine pair, C225 and C462, is located at the active site (Fig. 2), and the second pair, C754 and C759, is located on the flexible C-terminal tail of R1 and is therefore not resolved in the crystal structure. A model peptide of the C-terminal tail of R1, which included C754S and C759, has been shown to interact with glutaredoxin mutant C14S using NMR spectroscopy. The cysteine-to-serine mutations prevented formation of intramolecular disulfide bridges, and instead, an intermolecular, mixed disulfide bridge was observed between C11 on glutaredoxin and C759 on the model peptide [58]. Already at an early stage, it was realized that the wellknown tyrosyl radical in R2 (see below) could not be directly involved in catalysis, and that a different protein

radical at the active site in R1 had to be the one responsible for abstracting the 3V -hydrogen from the substrate [59]. The biochemical, structural, and sequence analysis of R1 revealed that this radical had to be positioned on the conserved cysteine residue C439 [57]. The crystal structure confirmed its proximity to the expected 3V -position of the substrate [60] (Fig. 2). Apart from the active site cysteines, the cysteine C292 is located at the low affinity allosteric site. In the mutant R1C292A, the activity was reduced with 50% compared to the wild type using thioredoxin as reductant [54]. This can be explained by the distorted binding of the positive effector ATP, but the actual mechanism for the involvement of C292 is still unclear [61]. 2.3.2. Reaction mechanism The triggering of the substrate turnover in class I RNR is not fully understood, but complex formation between R1 and R2, and binding of the substrate in the reduced form of R1 is essential, as the tyrosyl radical in R2 needs to be transferred to the active site of R1 [3,11,62]. The generation of the tyrosyl radical, and the radical transfer is described in more detail below (see Section 3). A scheme for the catalytic cycle in R1 starting from a thiyl radical at C439 has been proposed based on experimental data from several biochemical studies, active site mutants, as well as advanced EPR methods [5,56]. The thiyl radical is generated by a long-range radical transfer from the tyrosyl radical Y122 in R2; see Section 3.5. The thiyl radical is believed to be a common feature of all the three known classes of RNR [12,15], and theoretical studies confirm its importance [63]. In the first step of the substrate turnover cycle (Fig. 3A), the thiyl radical C439 (state 1) will abstract the 3V -hydrogen atom from the ribose ring of the substrate and thereby generate a substrate radical (state 2). The abstraction of the 3V -hydrogen has been verified by 3H-labelling of a substrate analogue, where a 3H label was found on the protein after an quenched turnover reaction [59]. 3V -Hydrogen abstraction from ribose by thiyl radicals has also been mimicked in model compounds [64,65]. The ribose radical makes the 2V -OH-group more accessible to acid catalysis, and the 2V -OH-group is therefore protonated by C225 and then leaves as a water molecule. The substrate is thereby converted to a 2V -ketyl radical (state 3). The two cysteine residues, C225 and C462, are then oxidized to a disulfide anion radical when they transfer a hydrogen atom to the substrate (state 4). This novel intermediate was first observed by X-band EPR during turnover time course studies in the mutant E441Q of R1 [66,67], and the nature of this radical was recognized as a sulfur-centred species on cysteine. However, the position in R1 could not be unambiguously determined due to the overlap of at least two other radical species, namely the bulk tyrosyl radical in R2 and a weak substrate radical signal. Later, the identity as a disulfide

anion radical was evidenced by pulsed high-field EPR, where the different radical signals could be isolated based on their different spin relaxation behaviour [68]. The gvalues of this radical are listed together with other radical species in RNR in Table 3. In the proposed reaction scheme for wild-type R1, the excess radical electron is then transferred via a chain of hydrogen bonded active site residues, N437 and E441, to the substrate 2V -position, thereby regenerating a substrate radical (state 5). This substrate radical then abstracts the hydrogen from C439, which results in completion of the deoxyribonucleotide product and a thiyl radical on C439 (state 6). The radical state is then transferred via the long range radical transfer chain back to the R2 subunit reforming the stable tyrosyl radical Y122.. For a complete turnover, the active site disulfide bridge between C225 and C462 must be reduced. The electron needed for this reduction is provided via a redox chain which involves a cysteine pair at the surface of R1 (C754 and C759), thioredoxin (or glutaredoxin), and finally the NADPH binding flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase [69]. Thus, NADPH ultimately provides the reducing power of class I RNR. For in vitro experiments, the disulfide bridges can also be reduced by small thiol compounds such as dithiothreitol (DTT), which, however, gives only half of the specific activity [54]. The reduction of the disulfide bridge at the active site in R1 would be very difficult to accomplish if a radical state were still located close by, e.g. at C439. In that case, the radical, rather than the disulfide bridge, would probably be reduced. This might be an explanation for why RNR utilizes a separate protein, R2, for storage of the radical, since the thioredoxin reduction system cannot access the tyrosyl radical inside the R2 protein. 2.4. The catalytic cycle of class II RNR The active site of class II RNR contains all the conserved residues that are found in class I RNR (see Fig. 2); the cysteine radical site C439 in E. coli class Ia RNR equals C408 in L. leichmannii class II RNR, the neighbouring N437 and E441, which are described for E. coli above, find their equals in N406 and E410 in L. leichmannii, and the cysteine pair C225 and C462 equals C119 and C419 in L. leichmannii (Fig. 2), indicating that the reaction mechanism should be very similar to class I [70] (see Fig. 3A). As in class I RNR, five cysteines have been shown to be essential for a complete turnover of class II RNR, including a cysteine pair at the surface, C731 and C736 in L. leichmannii corresponding to C754 and C759 in E. coli class Ia [71]. However, in class II, in contrast to class I RNR and class III, there is no indication of a separate protein radical site, or a hydrogen bonded pathway that could transfer a radical state to the active site cysteine radical site, C408. Instead, the cysteine radical in class II RNR is believed to be generated directly at the active site using the vitamin B12 derivative, 5V -

that the thiyl radical would be close to cobalt(II) [72], which was later observed in the crystal structure [14]. As in class I RNR, there is an external redox active pair of cysteines that can interact with thioredoxin to complete the catalytic cycle by reducing the formed disulfide bond at the active site cysteine pair [71]. Thioredoxin is ultimately reoxidized by thioredoxin reductase taking electrons from the NADPH pool. 2.5. The catalytic cycle of class III RNR In the structure of class III RNR from bacteriophage T4, there are only two highly conserved cysteines at the active site, C290 and C79. C290 is situated in the same position as the proposed thiyl radical cysteines of class I and II, at the tip of the finger loop (Fig. 2), and is proposed to play a similar role as a 3V -hydrogen abstractor of the substrate ribose [32,45]. Formation of the thiyl radical is a very complex reaction in class III RNR, and very little is known. It is believed that in the reduced (4Fe ­4S)+ state, the small activase subunit generates a homolytic cleavage in SAM [73] leading to a 5V -deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate, which in turn generates a stable glycyl radical on the large subunit [74,75], and finally, the thiyl radical is formed from the glycyl radical. This reaction is believed to be essentially similar to the glycyl radical formation reaction in pyruvate formate lyase [76,77], and benzylsuccinate synthase [78]. The second active site cysteine of the bacteriophage T4 class III RNR, C79, is located at a similar position as one of the cysteines of the redox pair in class I and II, namely C225 in E. coli class I and C119 in L. leichmannii class II RNR. However, in class III, C79 does not have a cysteine redox partner, suggesting that some steps of the reaction mechanism must be different than in class I and II, where the formation of a disulfide bridge provides the initial electrons needed for reduction of the substrate. Instead, formate has been shown to be the primary electron donor during substrate turnover in class III RNR, as formate is oxidized to carbon dioxide [47]. Furthermore, the essential glutamate and asparagine residues found in the active sites of both class I and II (E441 and N437 in E. coli class Ia) are missing, and instead there are two positively charged amino acid residues close to C290 in T4 RNR, R291 and K233, the latter within hydrogen bonding distance (2.5 ­ ° 2.8 A) to C290 in all structures available so far [48] (see Fig. 2). The positive charges might stabilize the binding of the negatively charged formate group. Nevertheless, many of the known mechanism based inhibitors of class I and II

deoxyadenosylcobalamin. This cofactor therefore seems to replace the role of the h2 subunits of class I and III as the radical generator. The generation of the thiyl radical is done after the homolytic cleavage of the deoxyadenoslycobalamin bond generating cobalt(II) and an deoxyadenosyl radical that probably abstracts a hydrogen atom from C408. Specific deuterium labeling of C408 induced novel spectral features of the cobalt(II) EPR signal suggesting

RNRs, such as the 2V -azido and 2V -halogenated nucleotides, work well as inhibitors also in class III [79], suggesting that many features of the reaction mechanism should be similar in the three classes of RNR. A reaction mechanism for class III RNR [32,45] has been proposed based on the previously described mechanism for class I and the beautiful studies by Reichard and Fontecave and coworkers, as well as theroretical studies [80] (Fig. 3B). The reaction starts out by abstraction of the 3V -hydrogen by the thiyl radical on C290, analogously to class I and II (see Fig. 3A). The following step is also believed to be similar to class I and II, where the 2V -OH group is protonated by another cysteine (C79 in T4) and leaves as water (Fig. 3B, state 2). For the following step, it has been suggested that the 3V -OH group is deprotonated generating a ketyl radical on the ribose ring (state 3), however, in class III, there is no obvious amino acid residue that can take the place of the proton acceptor, E441 in E. coli class I, or E410 in L. leichmannii class II RNR. It has been suggested, based on theoretical studies, that the formate might assist in the deprotonation [80]. The substrate radical then abstracts an electron from C79 and becomes protonated. C79 is left as a new thiyl radical (state 4), which in turn abstracts an electron from formate, forming a formyl radical (state 5). The formyl radical could then generate a radical on the ribose ring (state 6), which finally abstracts the hydrogen atom from C290, leaving a thiyl radical and the deoxyribonucleotide product (state 7). The radical could then be transferred back to the initial glycyl residue. There is at least one, or possibly two, conserved positively charged amino acid residue(s) at the active site of Bacteriophage T4 class III RNR. R291, and K234. The role of these residues remains unknown, but the proton fed into the reaction in Fig. 3B (between state 3 and 4) could be provided by a basic amino acid. 2.6. Spectroscopic studies on cysteine radicals The cysteine radical is a central point of the reaction mechanisms of all three classes of RNR. However, there are only very limited spectroscopic data that verify the presence of this radical, and its presence is mainly based on indirect evidence indicating radical chemistry being involved in the abstraction of the 3V of the ribonucleotide substrate [59]. -H Only in class II RNR, spectroscopic evidence for a thiyl radical interacting with the cobalt cofactor has been reported [81]. However, attempts have been made to generate cysteine radicals artificially in the R1 subunit of class I RNR, providing the first spectrocopic data on protein based cysteine radicals [82,83]. It was demonstrated that cysteine radicals could be generated by three different methods, UV irradiation, oxidation of cysteines by cerium(IV) in complex with nitrilotriacetic acid (CeIV/NTA), and by photolytic cleavage of nitrosylated cysteines, but neither of these

methods is specific for the active site cysteine, and in neither case, a triggering of the substrate turnover has been detected so far. These studies showed that a protein associated cysteine radical has a characteristic axial EPR signal with a weak, broad g| |-component and a strong, narrow g?-component at 2.008 of the axial EPR spectrum. The g| |-component is very sensitive to the electrostatic environment, e.g. H-bonding, and was shown to vary from 2.30 with a weak H-bond to 2.18 with a strong H-bond (see Table 3). The spin-lattice relaxation of the two g-components was also shown to be very anisotropic, which is unusual for an organic radical, but can be explained by the large spin-orbit coupling constant for sulfur [83,84]. 2.7. Allosteric regulation One special characteristic of RNR is that this enzyme catalyses the reduction of all four ribonucleotides: 5V -di(or tri)phospho-adenosine, -cytidine, -guanosine, and -uridine. There is a difference in the number of phosphate groups on the substrates utilized by the three classes of RNR, as class I enzymes reduce ribonucleoside 5V -diphosphates (NDPs) to deoxyribonucleoside 5V -diphosphates (dNDPs), whereas most class II and all class III enzymes described so far reduce ribonucleoside 5V -triphosphates (NTPs) to deoxyribonucleoside 5V -triphosphates (dNTPs). The specificity for each of the four substrates is determined by the binding of an allosteric effector to the so-called specificity site, or S-site [17], which is located at a different site from the substrate binding catalytic site. The allosteric effectors that bind the S-site in all classes of RNR are the fully phosphorylated products dATP (or ATP), dTTP, and dGTP, while dCTP seems to have no effect, or only a minor effect [85], at physiological conditions. The regulation of the substrate specificity can be exemplified by the situation in class Ia RNR, although some speciesdependent variations of this general scheme have been found [7]: binding of dATP at the S-site promotes the binding and reduction of the pyrimidines CDP and UDP; binding of dTTP inhibits reduction of CDP and UDP and stimulates reduction of GDP; and binding of dGTP inhibits reduction of GDP and stimulates reduction of ADP. In most class I and II enzymes, the S-site does not discriminate between ATP and dATP, so ATP also promotes reduction of CDP and UDP. In addition, class Ia and many class III enzymes, but not class Ib and class II, have a general activity site, called the A-site, where binding of ATP activates RNR and binding of dATP turns the enzyme off. Therefore, dATP has both a stimulatory effect and an inhibitory effect; however, since the affinity for dATP is much higher at the S-site, the inhibitory effect is only significant at high concentrations of dATP. This type of feedback regulation ensures that there is a balanced pool of the four deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA synthesis in the cell.

Recently, it has been proposed that the activity of class Ia RNR also is regulated by a third site called the hexamerizaton site, H-site. ATP binding to this H-site promotes the formation of an R16R26 hexamer which is suggested to be the major active form of RNR in mammalian cells [86,87]. The presence of the H-site is, however, highly disputed but this model gives a novel interpretation of how the activity of RNR could be controlled from an inactive enzyme to a high output enzyme in S-phase but also to a slower producing enzyme when this might be preferable. The finding that the dimeric form of R1 is predominant in the nucleus while the hexameric is most abundant in the cytotoplasm [86] also raises the possibility that the RNR subunit p53R2, which is suggested to be located in the nucleus [39], might prefer a dimeric R1 complex for the relative smaller production needed for DNA repair compared to the massive production of deoxynucleotides needed in S-phase of the cell cycle where the cytosolic R2 might prefer a more effective R1 hexamer. The location of the allosteric sites in the three classes of RNR has been identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies and by cocrystallisation of allosteric effectors with the respective proteins (Fig. 4). The high degree of similarity between the a/h-barrel structures of the substrate binding sites in the three classes of RNR described in the previous sections suggests that the location and function of the specificity sites might also be comparable. Indeed, the specificity sites are found at a four-helix bundle at the dimer interface in class Ia [60], class Ib [49], as well as class III [48] RNR. Interestingly, in the monomeric class II enzyme from L. leichmannii, the specificity site is proposed to be at a fourhelix bundle in connection with an additional domain of the protein that mimics the dimer interface of other RNRs [14,88] (Fig. 4). In all three classes of RNR, some of the amino acid residues known to bind the effectors are conserved in the four-helix bundle. The approximate distance between the specificity site and ° the active site is found to be 25 A intramolecularly in class I, ° in class II and 25 A in class III [14]. One question is ° 15 A how the binding of the allosteric regulator can control the specificity of the distant activity site. In the homodimer of class I, there seems to be an intermolecular cross talk between the two protomers. The distance between the ° specificity site and the active site is found to be 15 A intermolecularly. Based on the structural findings in L. leichmannii and its homology to the head-to-tail dimer of class I (see Fig. 4), it has been proposed that the regulation of the activity occurs intramolecularly in class II and involves a conformational changes in the enzyme [14]. In the class III RNR, however, which is a head-to-head dimer (see Fig. 4), the structural differences indicate that its regulation might be slightly different. In class I, the picture is also complicated by the fact that binding of the R2 protein is expected to cause conformational changes in R1, it is difficult to draw conclusions for the active R1/R2 holoenzyme purely based on structural data from the isolated R1 protein. A more exten-

3. Structure and function of the protein subunit R2 of class I RNR In class I RNR, the initial radical needed for reduction of ribonucleotides is generated, and stored on the protein

subunit R2, separate from the active site subunit, R1. This radical is generated on a tyrosine residue close to a diiron centre and is deeply buried inside the R2 subunit protected from the solvent. The first crystal structure of an R2 protein was the E. coli R2 published by Nordlund et al. in 1990 [89] with some refinements in 1993 [90]. This structure confirmed that R2 had a binding site for two iron atoms in each of its two identical protomers, and a potential tyrosyl radical site close by (Y122 in E. coli). The protein has mainly a-helical structure, and each of the diiron centres is coordinated by one aspartate (D84), two hisidine (H118 and H241), and three glutamate residues (E115, E204, and E238) that are brought together on the inside of a four-a-helix bundle.

These residues are conserved in all class I RNRs with very few exceptions (see Section 3.4). The incorporation of iron into the R2 subunit and the oxygen activation of the diiron centre in vivo are still poorly understood and little data are available. In purified E. coli R2 samples, however, it has been studied in detail, in a process called the reconstitution reaction [63,91 ­ 96] (Fig. 5). 3.1. Reactivation of the diiron-oxygen centre Molecular oxygen, or dioxygen, plays a key role in many important biological processes, the best known probably being the mitochondrial respiration where the copper/iron

enzyme cytochrome c oxidase cleaves dioxygen and reduces it into two water molecules [97]. This reaction requires the input of four electrons, which in the case of cytochrome c oxidase can be linked to the oxidation of NADH in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which is crucial for the energy household in all aerobic nonphotosynthetic cells. It is the triplet state nature of the oxygen molecule that makes the involvement of metals, radicals, or organic cofactors indispensable for many proteins. Reactions between singlet state organic compounds with triplet state dioxygen are spin forbidden, but transition metals, such as copper and iron, are not limited to one spin state, due to the possibility of rearrangement of the electrons in the partially filled d-orbitals, and they can activate the oxygen by converting it into singlet state [98,99]. In RNR, dioxygen is activated by a ferrous diiron centre. The diiron centre of class I RNR is not unique for this protein; very similar centres are found in many other proteins, for instance the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenase (MMOH) and in D9 stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase, all of which have been found to bind dioxygen, and the overall protein fold is also very similar. In some cases, like the oxygen carrier protein hemerythrin, the binding of oxygen is reversible, but in general, the dioxygen is cleaved and used for catalysis [11,22,92]. Two of the four electrons needed for reduction of dioxygen to water in RNR are from iron(II) oxidation to iron(III), one is from oxidation of a tyrosine (generating the tyrosyl radical), and the last electron could come from external reductants like iron(II). Some studies suggest, in analogy with monooxygenases, peroxidases, and possibly cytochrome c oxidase, that the breakage of the oxygen ­ oxygen bond in the peroxide state is heterolytic, generating water (2 electrons) and a highly oxidized peroxidase type compound I intermediate, where in RNR, one of the two oxidized equivalents is on the iron-cluster and the second equivalent on a transient tryptophan radical. It is still possible that the oxygen ­ oxygen cleavage could occur with the addition of a third electron to the peroxide complex, generating compound X directly (see below) [100 ­ 103]. We describe different oxidation states and intermediates and their generation one by one. In this section, we mainly describe reactions with native E. coli RNR R2 if not otherwise stated. 3.1.1. Apo R2 The crystal structure of apo R2, i.e. in absence of the metal cofactors, from E. coli was solved in 1993 [104]. Only relatively small differences in the positions of the iron coordinating side chains are seen as they move slightly inwards to occupy the space vacated by the iron atoms. Thereby, most of the side chains normally involved in metal binding and electron transfer form a hydrogen bonded network in the interior of the protein. No water molecules are bound in the place of the irons in the apo form.

3.1.2. Diferrous and dimanganese R2 Addition of a fourfold molar excess of a ferrous iron to the apo protein will give the reduced diferrous, FeIIFeII, form of the diiron centre in both protomers of the R2 dimer, which is stable under anaerobic conditions [105] (see Fig. 5). The X-ray structure of this diferrous form of ° R2 has been obtained with 1.7-A resolution [106]. In the crystal structure of reduced E. coli R2, the iron ions appear to have fourfold ligand coordination and can be described as distorted tetrahedrons; however, in one of the protomer chains of the crystal structure--chain B--Fe2 is better described as being five-coordinated [106]. This protomer difference was explained by so-called crystal packing effects [106]. In both chains, Fe1 and Fe2 are coordinated by one histidine, H118 and H241, respective° ly, and the iron ­ iron distance is 3.9 A; E115 and E238 are bridging the two irons, using both of their carboxyl oxygens, and D84 is a monodentate terminal ligand to Fe1. E204, however, is a monodentate terminal ligand to Fe1 in chain A, and a bidentate ligand to Fe2 in chain B. See also Section 3.2.1 for discussion of the diferrous form. MCD studies of diferrous E. coli R2 show that the two high spin irons (S = 2) have large axial zero-field splitting parameters (D) with opposite signs, which couple weakly anti-ferromagnetically to a net ground state spin of S = 2 [107 ­109]. This state is not observable by X-band EPR. The opposite signs of the D's indicate a different coordination environment and can be best described as one fourcoordinated and one five-coordinated iron [107]. The diferrous mouse R2, however, has significantly smaller y (or D), which is a different zero-field splitting parameter for the MS = F 2 sublevels. The smaller y is due to a small perturbation of the four-coordinated iron, and therefore an EPR spectrum of this protein is observable even at X-band [109,110]. An X-ray structure of E. coli R2 substituted with manganese(II) was solved prior to the diferrous form and worked as a model for the reduced R2 [111]. Later a higher-resolution structure confirmed this structure [112]. In the MnR2 structure, an additional water molecule is coordinated to Mn2, making it five-coordinated in both protomer chains. E204 is clearly a monodentate terminal ligand to Mn2, with one carboxyl oxygen pointing away from the metal centre, whereas in the diferrous R2, E204 is possibly a bidentate ligand to Fe2. Advanced saturation magnetisation studies (SQUID) by le Pape and coworkers of di-MnII R2 from E. coli, mouse, and Corynebacterium ammoniagenes in presence of 20% glycerol show differences in the very weak coupling between the two MnII, which could be correlated to differences in the 3D structure (K.R. Strand, Y. Huque, M. Sahlin, A. Liu, B.-M. Sjoberg, A. Graslund, K.K. Andersson, M. Atta, ¨ ¨ M. Fontecave, A.-L. Barra, N. Debaecker-Petit, E. Perret, E. Blasco, J. M. Latour, and L. Le Pape, unpublished data). Stronger magnetic coupling between E. coli MnII was

suggested by Pierce et al. [113] by simulation of integer spin EPR of the cluster. 3.1.3. O2 binding--azide binding If molecular oxygen is allowed to react with the diferrous R2, it will spontaneously oxidize the diiron site through a series of intermediate states, leading to the diferric iron centre, FeIIIFeIII, and a stable tyrosyl radical (Fig. 5). The first step of the oxygen reaction is the formation of a diferrous-oxygen complex, which has so far not been observed in RNR. In MMOH, however, there is indirect evidence for the existence of this complex, called intermediate O [22,114]. In RNR, azide has been used to mimic the interaction since this compound will bind to iron(II) without oxidising it. Crystals of reduced E. coli R2 with azide bound to the iron centre have so far not been obtained with the wild-type R2, but it was successfully achieved using the mutant protein F208A/Y122F that has a larger hydrophobic pocket surrounding the diiron centre [91]. This structure showed that the binding of azide to Fe2, the furthest away from Y122, is accompanied by movement of the carboxylate ligand E238, a so-called carboxylate shift. The carboxylate group shifts from having one carboxyl oxygen coordinated to each iron, to having one oxygen bridging the two irons and whereas the second oxygen is still coordinated to Fe2. Thereby, the iron coordination number is increased to six for Fe2, while Fe1 remains four-coordinated [91]. Through this bridging, the Fe ­Fe distance is ° ° shortened to 3.4A, compared to the 3.9 A observed in the structure of the diferrous wild-type protein [106]. The structural similarities to the carboxylate coordinations observed in MMOH were the basis for prediction of a refined oxygen activation mechanism [91], which is described in Fig. 5. Interestingly, for the azide complex of the diferrous form of both mouse R2 and E. coli R2, an integer high spin state, S = 4, has been observed using parallel mode EPR, discussed in Ref. [110]. From the crystal structure of a second R2 mutant, E238A/Y122F, an azide was shown to bind between the two ferrous irons, and in the single mutant E238A, high concentrations of azide could ``compensate'' for the lost carboxylate group, enabling the generation of the tyrosyl radical [115]. 3.1.4. Intermediate P Based on the homology to related diiron proteins, it could be expected that when dioxygen binds the reduced iron centre of R2, the oxygen atoms immediately abstract one electron from each iron and thus forming a A-1,2-peroxy diferric intermediate [91,92]. This bright blue coloured peroxo intermediate, with a local optical absorption maximum around 650 ­ 750 nm due to a peroxide-to-FeIII charge transfer transition, has been observed during oxygen activation of the diiron centre in MMOH [116,117] and D9 stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase [118,119]. In the R2 protein, however, there is no conclusive evidence for the

presence of a peroxo intermediate in the wild type; it has only been observed in the mutants R2-D84E and R2-W48F/ D84E [120,121], which mimic the iron centre of MMOH. The crystal structures of these mutants in the fully reduced form revealed a very close similarity in the coordination sphere of the diferrous centre very similar to that in reduced MMOH. 3.1.5. Intermediate U Cleavage of the peroxo complex requires the input of two electrons to oxygen. In MMOH, these are initially provided by the two irons, which results in formation of a diiron(IV) intermediate with two A-oxo bridges, named Q with a very symmetrical diamond core structure (see Fig. 5). Intermediate Q is stabilized if there is no methane, or other oxidizable substrates, present [11,22,122]. In R2, an intermediate Q has not been observed, which could be explained by the fact that the diiron centre is connected to the surface of the protein by a chain of hydrogen bonded amino acid residues. There are also several amino acid residues close to the diiron centre with sufficiently low redox potentials to provide electrons to the cleavage of the oxygens, such as tyrosines and tryptophans. The formation of radicals on these residues is probably more favourable, although it cannot be ruled out that a Q species precedes these radicals. It has been demonstrated that R2 is dependent on an electron from an external source, e.g. exogenous iron(II) [123], or alternatively, it has been suggested that the source of this electron could be a ferrous iron in the diiron site of the second R2 protomer [124]. Nevertheless, if the reconstitution reaction in R2 is carried out under limiting iron supply (less than 2.4 irons per R2), a distinct red-coloured intermediate called ``U'' has been observed in the wild-type R2 with an optical absorption band at 560 nm [125]. This intermediate has been shown to be a protonated tryptophan radical on W48, a member of the radical transfer chain [126,127], and would be formed after heterolytic cleavage of the peroxy-bond generating a very strong oxidant that could oxidize the tryptophan, corresponding to compound I of the peroxidase cycle. EPR and Mossbauer experiments suggest that ¨ the tryptophan radical is magnetically coupled to an FeIIIFeIV centre, similar to X (see below), suggesting that the cleavage reaction of the peroxide has obtained one electron from the irons, and one from W48 [126]. Under limiting iron supply, the tryptophan radical, which is part of the radical transfer pathway, is ``waiting'' for an external ferrous iron to dock [126,127]. In the mutant R2-W48F, where the electron can no longer be obtained from tryptophan, the electron is instead taken from Y122, forming a tyrosyl radical coupled to an X-like FeIIIFeIV centre. However, it cannot be fully excluded that the kinetics of the oxygen cleavage reaction in the mutant R2-W48F is different, or that the there exists an alternative route for uptake of electrons.

3.1.6. Intermediate X If the reconstitution of apo R2 is performed with excess of iron (more than five irons per R2) the lifetime of the intermediate U is too short to be observed [128]. Instead, its successor called intermediate ``X'' is observed directly (Fig. 5). Intermediate X has been formally described as an FeIIIFeIV mixed valence state based on 57Fe ENDOR studies [129]. From EXAFS studies of intermediate X, it has been suggested that the diiron centre has a very short ° ° iron ­ iron distance, 2.5 A, compared to 3.2 ­ 3.4 A measured ° for the diferrous for the diferric met R2 form, and 3.4­ 3.9 A reduced form [130]. Intermediate X is stable on a few seconds time-scale, and in mutants where the essential tyrosyl residue is substituted with non-oxidizable amino acids, such as R2-Y122F, the lifetime of intermediate X is doubled, allowing for freeze-quenching and spectroscopic characterization [125,128,131­ 135]. These studies suggest that both irons are six-coordinated in intermediate X, one oxygen atom is forming a terminal hydroxo ligand to one iron, whereas the second oxygen atom is engaged in a A-oxo bridge between the irons (Fig. 5). Due to the mixed valence state, the antiferromagnetically coupled high-spin irons FeIII (S = 5/2) and FeIV (S = 2) form an S = 1/2 ground state that is paramagnetic and suitable for EPR and MCD characterization. Recent freeze-quench MCD study of R2 mutant Y122F/Y356F, in which up to 1.4 equivalents of X can be generated, indicated that an oxygen atom is engaged in a Aoxo bridge between the irons and that a second carboxylateoxygen could possibly make a second single oxygen bridge, the data argues against two oxo-bridges [136]. This state corresponds to the extremely shortlived R (di-radical) state in the activation of MMOH [11,22,137] and compound II state in the peroxidase reaction cycle. Studies on the R2 protein from mouse R2 indicate that intermediate X plays a very similar role in the mammalian enzyme, although the kinetics and yields of the different intermediates of the reconstitution reaction are slightly different than in E. coli [138,139]. 3.1.7. The active form In the final step of the activation process (Fig. 5), the intermediate X oxidizes the nearby tyrosyl residue Y122 to a stable tyrosyl radical by hydrogen atom abstraction from the phenol oxygen, and the iron site is left in a A-oxo bridged diferric form, FeIIIFeIII, with a water ligand on both irons in E. coli R2. The tyrosyl radical can be observed by optical spectroscopy by a characteristic peak at 410 nm [140], and it can be observed by EPR giving rise to a doublet spectrum with an isotropic g-value of 2.0047 [141], typical for an organic radical, but with a microwave power saturation behaviour clearly influenced by the nearby diiron site, which leads to fast relaxation [142,143]. However, the magnitude of the coupling varies significantly between R2 proteins from different species [143]. The antiferromagnetically coupled diferric iron centre itself is EPR silent, but it gives rise to a characteristic

oxo-to-iron charge transfer transition with a broad strong optical spectrum with maxima at 325 and 370 nm [140]. The maximum yield of the Y122 radical ranges from 1.2 per R2 dimer in E. coli to 1.5 in mouse R2, i.e. a little more than expected for half site occupancy; the reason for this is still unclear. 3.1.8. Single crystal studies of active R2 So far, it has not been possible to generate significant amounts of the active form of class I R2 to obtain structural information about the tyrosyl radical Y122. from X-ray crystallography. However, in a recent study [144], by reactivating a single crystal of apo R2 from E. coli with iron(II) and oxygen, or alternatively, a single crystal of met R2 with hydrogen peroxide, it was possible to generate 10­ 20% radicals per R2 dimer, which is sufficient for W-band (95 GHz) EPR spectroscopy. The fact that the radical can be generated in crystals of the apo protein by the reconstitution reaction with ferrous iron and molecular oxygen shows that the crystallized protein is in the native state and able to undergo the structural changes needed for the reaction. By simulation of the rotation pattern of W-band EPR spectra of the R2 single crystal, it was possible to obtain the orientation of the g-tensor axes with respect to the crystal axes, and thus the orientation of the tyrosine side chain in the radical state, since the gx and gy axes are known to be coplanar with the tyrosyl radical ring plane. Comparison of the g-tensor axes with the electron density of the tyrosine residue Y122 from the X-ray structure in the non-radical form reveals that the tyrosine has shifted between the two states (Fig. 6). The shifting can be accomplished by rotation about the two free molecular axes of the tyrosine side chain, 11j for Ca-Ch and À 3j for Ch-C1. Compared with the native tyrosine, the tyrosyl radical is rotated away from the diiron centre. In the non-radical form, ° the tyrosine oxygen is at a distance of about 3.2 A from the nearest D84 carboxyl oxygen, possibly forming a weak Hbond. In the deprotonated radical form, however, the dis° tance to D84 has increased to over 4 A, which is clearly beyond hydrogen bonding distance (Fig. 6). This is consistent with the large gx-component ( gx = 2.00912) observed for the tyrosyl radical in both frozen solution and in the crystal of E. coli R2, and is indicative of a non-polar environment, i.e. no hydrogen bonding [145 ­ 151]. The lack of a proton between D84 and Y122. leads to a repulsion between these two residues, which might be the major driving force for the observed conformational change. As a consequence, Y122. is disconnected from the iron coordination sphere, which likely contributes to its unusual stability. The increased distance between the centre of spin density of the tyrosyl radical and the diiron centre also suggests that their exchange interaction could be somewhat weaker than Jex = 0.0047 cmÀ 1, which was estimated based ° on the distance calculated from the old 2.2-A X-ray structure data of the non-radical diferric R2 from E. coli [142,143].

3.1.9. Diferric (met) R2 In addition to the intermediates directly involved in the reconstitution process, two further states can also be generated in vitro. These include the stable inactive met R2 state, which is a non-radical FeIIIFeIII state, as well as an intermediate mixed valence FeIIFeIII state. The met R2 state is generated spontaneously upon storage of the purified iron-containing protein in solution, and therefore, all crystals structures of oxidized protein have been of the met R2 state. The met R2 state can also be generated by selective reduction of the tyrosyl radical using hydroxyurea [152,153], or various hydrazines [154,155] and alkoxyphenols [34]. Some interesting examples are resveratrol, a natural component of red wines [156] and paracetamol used in pain killers [157]. In the crystal structure of E. coli met R2, the iron centre is dibridged and the two iron ions have a octahedral coordination by two histidines, three glutamic acids, one aspartic acid, an oxide ion and two water molecules [90]. The A-oxo group and the carboxylate of E115 bridge the two irons. The carboxylate of E238 is also located between the two iron atoms, but in met R2 it is a ligand only to Fe2. Fe2 has two additional protein ligands, E204 and H241. In addition, both Fe1 and Fe2 have one non-protein ligand assigned as water. The ° distance between the two iron atoms is around 3.3 A in met R2. In the original met R2 structure [89,90], both the metals in the diiron centre were assigned as being sixcoordinate; however, in a recently solved high-resolution ° structure (1.42 A) Fe1 is five-coordinate [144]. The difference arises from a slight change in the conformation of D84 that instead of being a bidentate ligand to Fe1, makes a monodentate interaction with Fe1 and the free carboxylate oxygen making a H-bond to the water coordinated to Fe2.

Details about the diferric form of R2 of mouse and E. coli are also discussed in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.5. 3.1.10. Mixed valence The intermediate mixed valence FeIIFeIII state can be observed in mouse and herpes simplex type 1 R2 by reduction to the diferrous state using, e.g. ascorbate or dithionite (Fig. 5) [158]. In the wild-type E. coli R2, this mixed valence state has been observed after radiolytic reduction at low temperature [159 ­ 161], and reduction by hydrazines at high pH [154]. In most cases, S = 2 FeII and S = 5/2 FeIII are coupled antiferromagnetically to an S = 1/2 ground state, however, in the cryo-reduced E. coli R2, a ferromagnetic coupling to S = 9/2 has been observed by Mossbauer and EPR after annealing from 77 to 180 K. The ¨ shift from S = 1/2 to S = 9/2 was suggested to be accompanied by a carboxylate shift of E238 from monodentate terminal chelating mode of Fe2, to a bidentate bridging mode, and protonation of the A-oxo bridge [161]. In MMOH, binding of small ligands to the diiron centre, such as the reaction product methanol, has been demonstrated by monitoring the spectral properties of the mixed valence state [162 ­ 164]. Also in R2 from mouse, methanol has been demonstrated to affect the EPR spectrum of the FeIIFeIII state [165]. So far, it has not been possible to obtain crystal structures of the FeIIFeIII form of R2 from any organism, as opposed to the related protein MMOH [166]. However, a mixed valence form has been suggested to occur in crystals of a manganese substituted form of R2 from E. coli that was oxidized using either nitric oxide, or a combination of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxylamine [112]. The oxidation state of the two structures obtained probably both contained a mixed-valence MnII ­ MnIII conformation. In these structures, E238 adopts the same bridging-chelating conformation observed

for the azide binding double mutant F208A/Y122F [91]. This conformation is proposed to be important for proper O2 activation but not previously observed in the wild-type enzyme. 3.2. New crystal structures of mouse R2 3.2.1. Cooperative binding of cobalt(II) and iron(II) to mouse R2 The X-ray structure of class Ia R2 protein from mouse was solved in 1996; however, under the crystallization conditions used, pH 4.7, only one of the two metal binding sites (site 2) was occupied [43]. Recently, the first crystal structures of the mouse enzyme with fully occupied metal sites were solved by in soaking crystals in solutions of cobalt(II) [167], iron(II), or manganese(II) (S. Karlsen, K.R. Strand, K.K. Andersson, unpublished data) at different pH values. In agreement with the earlier results [43], only one metal ion was bound to the protein when the protein crystal

was equilibrated at pH 4.7; however, when the protein was soaked at pH 6.0, crystals with both metal sites occupied were obtained. Fig. 7A shows the structure of mouse R2 soaked in an aerobic solution of cobalt(II) at pH 6.0 [167] (pink sticks) in comparison with the structures of diferrous R2 from E. coli [106] (black sticks) and MMOH from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) [166] (green sticks). The numbering of the functionally important and conserved amino acid residues in both R2 and R1 from E. coli, mouse, and S. cerevisiae is listed in Table 4. As in the diferrous E. coli R2, there are no water, hydroxo, or oxo ligands coordinated to the metals in the dicobalt mouse R2, indicating that cobalt(II) does not react with oxygen under aerobic conditions. Both the glutamic acid ligands E170 and E267 of mouse R2 have a bidentate A-1,3-bridging mode to the cobalt ions, similar to the situation in the structure of the reduced diferrous, E. coli R2, although not as symmetric as observed in diferrous R2. Nevertheless, the metal-to-metal distance in dicobalt mouse

° R2 becomes 0.5 A shorter than the corresponding distance in ° the diferrous E. coli, 3.4 and 3.9 A, respectively, and is ° comparable to the distance measured in MMOH (3.3 A). It is possible that the pH in the E. coli structure was lowered by the addition of the reducing agent dithionite, which thereby increased the iron ­ iron distance (see below for the diferrous mouse R2 at low pH). In contrast to the diferrous R2 of E. coli, where D84, and possibly E204, are terminal monodentate ligands to each respective iron, the corresponding D139 and E233 in mouse R2 are both bidentate ligands to each of the to cobalt ions. Hence, in dicobalt mouse R2, both metals are five-coordinated, whereas at least one iron is four-coordinated in E. coli. The figure (Fig. 7A) demonstrates that all three carboxylate ligands in the different proteins have large relative shifts and that the cobalt structure shares larger similarity to MMOH than E. coli R2 does. Four different X-ray structures have been solved of mouse R2 soaked with iron(II) under different reducing aerobic conditions (S. Karlsen, K.R. Strand, K.K. Andersson, unpublished data) (Fig. 7B). The supposedly best X-ray structure is obtained from crystals of mouse apo R2 reconstituted with iron(II) in the presence of a buffered dithionite solution (pH 6.0) and a redox indicator (green structure in Fig. 7B). There are different amounts of water molecules close to the diiron centre in all four structures that are not present in the

structure of diferrous E. coli R2. However, in the green structure, there is only one that is very weakly coordinated to ° Fe2 with a Fe ­O bond length of 2.68 A, suggesting that no reaction with dioxygen has taken place (Fig. 7B). The variations observed for the four different structures of the same protein show that the ligands are subjected to relatively large carboxylate shifts, which also influence the coordination number of the iron ions. For all the four structures, the irons are, as expected, coordinated by histidines, H173 and H270, respectively, and one glutamate residue, E170, makes a A-1,3-bridge between the two irons (with exception of the light blue structure, see below). The two terminal carboxyl ligands, D139 and E233, are monodentate ligands to Fe1 and Fe2, respectively, comparable to the diferrous forms of both E. coli R2 and MMOH (Fig. 7A). Although the conformations of D139 and E233 are clearly shifted in the different structures, this does not change their coordination to the metal ions. The main difference to E. coli R2 is observed for the bridging glutamate residue, E267 (E238 in E. coli, E243 in MMOH). In diferrous E. coli R2, this residue makes a A-1,3bridge, whereas in MMOH and mouse R2, this residue is both a bidentate ligand to Fe2, as well as a A-1,1-bridge between the two irons. Thus, in mouse R2, Fe1 is fourcoordinated and Fe2 is five-coordinated, and MMOH both

five/five coordinated, possibly with a water ligand on FE2. For E. coli, Fe2 has been described as being four-coordinated [106] (see Section 3.1.2). The most dissimilar X-ray structure of diferrous mouse R2 is obtained with unbuffered dithionite, making the soaking conditions more acidic (light blue structure in Fig. 7B). Under these conditions, the bridging property of E170 is lost, as E170 is no longer a ligand to Fe1. The iron ­ iron ° distance is increased to 3.6 A. This makes Fe1 threecoordinated and Fe2 five-coordinated, and the relative electron density on Fe1 is low, indicating that this iron is loosely bound. A combined CD and variable-temperature variable-field (VTVH) MCD spectroscopic study of mouse R2 in 50% glycerol at pH 7.5 confirmed that the diferrous site consists of one four- and one five-coordinated iron, with zero-field splitting D-values of À 15 < D1 < À 10 and + 7 < D2 < + 10, respectively [109]. A very weak exchange coupling was found between the two sites, supporting the presence of carboxylate bridges. The combination of very weak coupling and opposite signs of the D-values results in the ground state S = F 2, explaining the integer spin EPR signal with geff = 8 in diferrous mouse R2. This agrees well with the integer spin EPR studies, which showed that the cobalt(II) ions in mouse R2 have a strong ferromagnetic coupling [167], whereas in a comparable study of dicobalt R2 from E. coli, no magnetic coupling is present between the two cobalt(II) ions, as all cobalt ions are EPR active [168]. The formation of the metal centre in mouse R2 has been followed spectroscopically during titration with cobalt(II) and exhibits a quite complex behaviour (Fig. 8A) [167]. First, the intensity of the perpendicular mode EPR spectrum of cobalt(II), as a function of the amount of cobalt(II) added, decreases during formation the ferromagnetically coupled dicobalt cluster. Subsequently, a g f 12 integer spin EPR signal with an S = 3 ground state is observed in parallel mode EPR. When the cobalt(II) binding to R2 was monitored by the formation of a 550-nm absorbing chromophore, a very strong cooperative binding of cobalt(II) was observed (Fig. 8A), demonstrating that high mobility of the carboxylate ligands could have a role in the cooperative binding. A similar binding behaviour has also been observed for iron(II), by following the d ­ d transition of iron(II) by CD and MCD in the near infrared region (700 ­ 2000 nm) (Fig. 8B) [109]. Both the cobalt(II) and iron(II) titrations with mouse R2 demonstrate a cooperative effect, which indicates that formation of one dimetal cluster in one protomer very strongly increases the formation of the second cluster in the second protomer. This is the first spectroscopic evidence for cooperative binding of iron and cobalt to R2. Relatively small changes in the iron concentration are needed to create a fully saturated R2 dimer compared to the iron concentration range needed for the two different hyperbolic binding mechanisms to form the binuclear cluster in the E. coli enzyme. However, compared to E. coli R2, the affinity for iron(II) is much lower. Thus, fully saturated metal clusters

The decrease of a g = 5.4 EPR signal (open squares) and increase of an absorption band at 550 nm (filled squares) at increasing metal/protein ratio indicate formation of an antiferromagnetically coupled dinuclear cobalt centre. (B) Titration of iron(II) into a constant concentration of mouse apo R2 followed by the MCD intensity at 5500 cmÀ 1 [109].

can only be obtained within a small range of iron concentrations in the cells. This might possibly be a novel regulatory mechanism utilized by mammalian cells for preventing the formation of the tyrosyl radical when it is not needed, or under unfavourable growth conditions, such as limiting oxygen concentrations, hypoxia [169]. In summary, there are several differences in the reactivity of the mouse and E. coli R2: (1) The stability of their metal centres are very different. The metal centres of mouse R2 are labile, and although the same mouse R2 dimer can carry out several redox cycles, a continuous supply of ferrous iron and oxygen is needed to keep the enzyme fully active. In contrast, the metal centres and tyrosyl radicals of the E. coli enzyme are stable at physiological conditions and can perform multiple turnovers of the substrate, in vitro. (2) Comparison of the 3D structures of these two R2 proteins reveals that the tyrosyl radical/diiron site in mouse R2 is accessible to solvent via a narrow hydrophobic channel, while this channel is blocked by an aromatic amino acid in

the E. coli R2 enzyme. (3) A greater flexibility is seen in all the four carboxylate ligands of the iron cluster in mouse R2 compared to E. coli R2. This might contribute to the lower kinetic and thermodynamic affinity for iron(II) in mouse R2 enzyme. (4) In mouse R2, the strong cooperative formation of the two binuclear ferrous clusters could indicate a very tightly regulated process of activating the mouse R2 protein. (5) In mouse R2, the cobalt(II) is ferromagnetically coupled, but not in E. coli R2. 3.2.2. Diferric (met) R2 in mouse Previous spectroscopic studies have revealed a hydrogen bonding network surrounding the diiron centre in mammalian R2s, including mouse R2 and also R2 from herpes simplex virus type 1, a virus of mammalian cells. They are both clearly different from E. coli R2, which has been regarded as the prototype of class Ia RNRs. The differences are apparent not only in the diferrous forms, as described above, but also in the mixed valence and oxidized forms [11,110,158]. Variable temperature saturation recovery EPR studies have shown that the antiferromagnetic coupling between the ferric iron in mouse (J = À 77 cmÀ 1 in water and À 70 cmÀ 1 in deuterium oxide) and herpes simplex virus type 1 ( À 66 cmÀ 1) R2s are weaker that in E. coli ( À 92 cmÀ 1), suggesting a hydrogen bond to A-oxo bridge in the two former proteins [143]. Resonance Raman studies show weaker symmetric stretch FeIII ­O­ FeIII modes for mouse (486 cmÀ 1) and herpes simplex virus type (482 cmÀ 1) R2s compared to E. coli R2 (493 cmÀ 1), and a deuterium shift of À 5 cmÀ 1 in mouse R2 showed presence of the postulated hydrogen bond to the A-oxo group [170]. Furthermore, high-field EPR of mouse and herpes simplex virus type 1 R2s showed presence of a different hydrogen bond to the tyrosyl radicals [147,150,151,171,172], as the g1 value of 2.0076 is lower than the E. coli 2.0091. The presence of hydrogen bonds to the tyrosyl radical could also be determined by resonance Raman [170] and H/D Q-band Mims ENDOR [147]. Both the hydrogen bonds to the tyrosyl radical and to the A-oxo bridge are absent in E. coli R2.

High field EPR could also reveal a third stronger D/H exchangeable proton in herpes simplex virus type 1 R2 [172], very likely present in mouse R2 also [171], but not present in E. coli R2. These spectroscopic properties can now be interpreted based on the X-ray structure for diferric (met) mouse R2 (pH 6.0), which is presented in Fig. 9 in comparison with the structure of E. coli R2. Most ligands have a very similar arrangement in the two R2 proteins (see Section 3.1.9), but there are some important differences. The A-oxo group of ° mouse R2 is located 1.86 and 1.88 A from Fe1 and Fe2, respectively, which is slightly shorter than the corresponding ° 1.94 and 1.93 A measured for E. coli R2 (protomer A) [144]. This difference is also reflected in the angle defined by Fe1­ O ­Fe2 which is 127j in mouse R2 and 122j in E. coli, ° whereas the Fe1 ­ Fe2 distances are 3.34 and 3.38 A in mouse and E. coli R2, respectively. Both E. coli and mouse R2 have two water molecules close to the irons. In E. coli they are coordinated to Fe1 and Fe2, respectively, but in mouse R2 only the water molecule closest to Fe2 is coordinated to the metal. The second water is located ° 3.30 A away from Fe1. This makes the metal cluster of the met form of mouse R2 four- and six-coordinated, as opposed to five- and six-coordinated in E. coli R2. The most apparent difference between the two structures in Fig. 9 is the carboxylate shift of D139 in mouse R2 and D84 in E. coli R2. In E. coli R2, this residue was previously described as a bidentate ligand to Fe1, but has in the more recent high resolution structure been established as a monodentate ligand [144]; in mouse R2, however, D139 is clearly monodentate, as one carboxyl oxygen is pointing away from Fe1. Some other smaller carboxylate shifts are also observed. The ENDOR measurements on the tyrosyl radical in mouse R2 showed that the H/D exchangeable proton is ° located at a distance of 1.89 A from the tyrosyl radicaloxygen and slightly below the tyrosyl ring plane [147], which does not fit with the distances and angles to the water ° ° observed 3.31 A away from Y177 and 3.30 A away from Fe1 in the X-ray structure diferric mouse R2 (see Fig. 9).

Since the distance between a proton and oxygen of water is ° approximately 1.0 A, this water oxygen must have moved ° to a position about 2.9 A away from Y177 ° more than 0.4 A in order to become hydrogen bonded to the Y177 radical. Another possibility is that the tyrosyl radical that has moved, as was indicated by the single crystal EPR study of active E. coli R2 [144]. In all structures of mouse R2 obtained so far, e.g. the diferrous (see Fig. 7B) and diferric mouse R2, there is also an additional water molecule on the ° opposite side of the phenoxyl oxygen of Y177 (2.61 A in diferric mouse R2, not shown in Fig. 9), which might be responsible for the H/D exchangeable proton detected by high field EPR. However, this water is too far away from Fe1 to account for the very weak exchange coupling observed between the diiron centre and Y177.. In E. coli R2, the oxygen in the A-oxo bridge can be exchanged very rapidly by soaking the active protein in 18/ 17 O-water [173]. In the mouse R2, on the other hand, it is very hard to exchange this oxygen, as one must perform the whole reconstitution reaction in presence of 18/17O-water to get in an isotope effect in the bridge [170]. The new structure explains this lack of 18/17O-exchange in mouse R2, as the A-oxo bridge is strongly interacting with the ° carboxylate oxygens from E267 with a distance of 2.39 A, suggesting that E267 is protonated and forms a hydrogen bond, and that the A-oxygen is closer to the two irons as described above. The consistency between the spectroscopic data on the hydrogen bond network and the X-ray structures shows that the metal centre in mouse R2 is well defined, despite the fact that mouse R2 loses iron easily. The hydrogen bonds orient the ferric ions, as well as the tyrosyl radical, in well-defined orientations. Theoretical analysis of the angle dependence of the tyrosyl radical [174] indicated that the tyrosyl ring plane of the radical in mouse R2 was in a higher energy level than the in E. coli, so in the radical form, the tyrosyl ring in mouse R2 might rotate and have a different angle than in the diferric non-radical form which is seen in Fig. 9. 3.3. Yeast RNR The RNR system in common bakers yeast S. cerevisiae is comprised of four genes, in contrast to other class I RNRs (see Table 4); rnr1 and rnr3 encode polypeptides for the large subunit, called RNR1 and RNR3 [175], or alternatively, Y1 and Y3 [176], and rnr2 and rnr4 encode polypeptides for the small subunit, called RNR2 and RNR4 [177], or alternatively, Y2 and Y4 [176]. The different roles of rnr1 and rnr3 are still quite unclear. Y1 (or RNR1) and Y3 (or RNR3) share 80% amino acid sequence identity, and both polypeptides contain all the essential amino acid residues believed to be involved in catalysis and allosteric regulation. It has been demonstrated that all three dimeric combinations of these two polypeptides (i.e. Y1Y1, Y1Y3, and Y3Y3) are catalytically active, although the specific activity of Y3

dimer is significantly lower than that of the Y1 dimer [178]. Expression of rnr1 is essential for the cells to enter mitosis, and the transcription of rnr1 is closely regulated by the cell cycle, however, there seems to be no explicit demand for expression of rnr3. Normally, the level of rnr3 expression is very low, however, it is strongly inducible by DNA damage when the expression level can increase by a factor of up to 100 [175]. The differences between the two genes encoding protomers for the small subunit, rnr2 and rnr4, are more striking in terms of the presence of functionally important amino acid residues. While Y2 (or RNR2) contains all the 16 critical residues conserved in almost all R2 proteins, six of these residues are missing in Y4 (or RNR4), including three that would be expected to be involved in iron binding (Table 4). Moreover, alignments of the amino acid sequences of Y2 and Y4 reveal only 47% identity, and Y4 is about 50 amino acid residues shorter at the N-terminus than normal R2 protomers, including Y2 [177]. Deletion of Y4 is lethal in some yeast strains and impairs cell growth in others, indicative of an important role in RNR function. The two proteins can form both homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes, but only complexes involving Y2 are catalytically active. It has been proposed that Y4 delivers iron ions to Y2 or/and stabilizes Y2 in the proper conformation for ion cluster assembly and radical formation [179]. The crystal structure of the yeast Y2Y4 heterodimer has been solved [180] and the overall a-helical fold is very similar to other homodimeric class I enzymes, such as E. coli and mouse R2. The metal binding sites of one class Ia R2 (mouse) and one class Ib R2 (S. typhimurium) are presented together with Y2 and Y4 in Fig. 11. The best data for yeast Y2Y4 were obtained at pH 5.3 with ZnII occupying site 2 of Y2, similar to the mono-Fe structure of mouse R2 at pH 4.7 [43,167]. A less well-resolved structure of Y2Y4 containing iron was obtained by soaking crystals of Y2Y4 heterodimers in a solution of ferrous ammonium sulfate at pH 5.1. The Fourier maps revealed binding of iron(II) in both site 1 and site 2 in Y2, whereas no metals were found coordinated to Y4 [180]. The FeII ­ FeII distance ° in Y2 was 3.7 A, a distance similar to the Fe­ Fe separation in reduced wild-type E. coli R2 [106]. 3.4. Other non-standard class I RNRs An intriguing type of RNR is found in various Mycoplasma strains, which are parasitic bacteria found on mammalian surfaces, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the respiratory tract and Mycoplasma genitalium in the urogenital tract. These organisms carry genes for class Ib RNR where the three iron-binding glutamic acid residues are missing [181 ­ 183]. However, so far there are no studies confirming that these proteins are actually active in the reduction of ribonucleotides. It is possible that these parasites cover their need for deoxyribonucleotides by exploiting the infected host organism.

In another interesting group of class Ia RNRs, the supposedly essential tyrosine radical site is substituted with phenylalanine. This type is found in human pathogens, such as Chlamydia trachomatis [184], Chlamydia pneumoniae [185], and Tropheryma whipplei [186], but also in the archaean Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 [187]. Nevertheless, the enzyme purified from C. trachomatis has been demonstrated to be active [188] suggesting that an alternative route for generation of a cysteine radical at the active site in R1 must be present. Finally, in the human Epstein­ Barr virus, a member of the herpes virus family, the aspartic acid residue coordinating Fe1 in R2 is replaced by glutamate [189]. The corresponding D84E mutant of the E. coli enzyme is still capable of forming a tyrosyl radical, however, the reaction kinetics are significantly modified, allowing a peroxodiiron(III) intermediate to be observed [120]. Interestingly, this particular arrangement of the diiron site is identical to the one found in the structurally related diiron protein methane monooxygenase [190], and it has been argued that this arrangement favours hydroxylation reactions [191]. 3.5. Radical transfer One of the most fascinating peculiarities of the class I RNRs is the unusually long radical transfer chain that is proposed to connect the essential tyrosyl radical in R2, and the putative thiyl radical at the substrate binding site in R1. Even in the most favourable docking models of the crystal structures of R1 and R2, the radical needs to traverse no less ° than 35 A [2,13], which is far beyond the reach of pure electron tunnelling processes found in most other biological electron transfer reactions. Instead, it has been proposed that the radical is transferred by proton coupled electron transfer via a chain of hydrogen bonded amino acid side chains [3,62,192 ­ 194]. Both the tyrosyl radical site Y122 in R2 and the thiyl radical site C439 of R1 are connected to the surface of the respective protein by a pathway of hydrogen bonds connecting conserved amino acid side chains, although in R2, it also includes Fe1 of the diiron centre (Fig. 10); Y730 and Y731 in R1 and D84, H118, D237, and W48 in R2 [13,90]. In addition, Y356 in E. coli [193,195], and its equivalent Y370 in mouse [196], has been shown to be important for the radical transfer. Due to its location in the flexible tail, Y356 is not resolved in the crystal structure of R2. In the crystals of R1, a 20-mer polypeptide corresponding to the Cterminal tail of R2 was essential to stabilize R1, and the last 16 residues (Q360 to L375) are clearly resolved in the crystal structure [13], but unfortunately not Y356. However, by modelling in the missing stretch from Y356 to Q360, it is clearly possible that Y356 could be within stacking distance of Y731 of R1. Arginine R236 might also play an important role in the radical transfer. This residue is conserved in all R2 and R2F sequences known so far (see also Table 4), in fact, the amino

acid sequence RDEXXH, which also contains another radical transfer residue and two iron-binding residues, seems to be a fingerprint for R2 proteins. Due to its exposed position on the surface of R2, it was suggested that this residue is involved interaction with R1 [90]. Furthermore, based on the structures of E. coli R2 and S. typhimurium R2F, it was proposed to play a role in the radical transfer [7]. In all presently solved crystal structures of R2 and R2F proteins from six different organisms (see Table 1), the arginine corresponding to R236 in E. coli R2 is joined to the proposed radical transfer network, either directly to D237, or via a water molecule close to D237 and W48 (Fig. 10). Since the side chain of R236, in contrast to that of W48, is exposed to the surface of the R2 protein, R236 can easily form a hydrogen bond to Y356 of the flexible tail of R2, or even directly to R1. However, there are currently no studies available to confirm this hypothesis. The connection between the diiron cluster and the tyrosyl radical is also a subject to debate. One intriguing finding is that the diiron cluster of the class Ib R2E from S. typhimurium has a weak exchange coupling with the tyrosyl radical [143] although the crystal structure showed that in the non-radical state, the distance between the ° tyrosine and Fe1 is 7 A [197] (see Fig. 11), which is long since exchange couplings need overlapping electron orbitals. Eriksson et al. [197] therefore suggested that the water molecule close to the radical could mediate the very weak exchange coupling. A recent structure of another class Ib enzyme from C. ammoniagenes [198] has a similarly long tyrosine-to-iron distance. The new mouse R2 structure revealed a similar situation: a water molecule between the tyrosine and the diiron-oxygen centre could be responsible for the observed weak exchange coupling, although ° in this case the total distance is slightly shorter, 5.9 A (S. Karlsen, K.R. Strand, K.K. Andersson, unpublished data). Thus, together these three cases indicate the water molecule might be a general way of connecting the tyrosyl radicals to the diiron clusters in isolated R2 from both class Ia and Ib. However, even when a water is included, the tyrosyl radical and the diiron centre need to move a little bit closer to be able to facilitate a radical transfer which is needed in the R1/R2 holoenzyme complex. As described in Section 3.1.8, it has been shown that a shifting of the tyrosine ring away from the diiron centre occurs in isolated E. coli R2 when it is converted from non-radical to radical form [144] (Fig. 6). In the R1/R2 complex, this shifting might well be inverted. Also in mouse R2, there is clear evidence for either a shifting of the radical and/or movement of the water molecule when one compares the structural data of the non-radical diferric form with the spectroscopic data of the radical containing active form (see Section 3.2.2) (S. Karlsen, K.R. Strand, K.K. Andersson, unpublished data). In the class Ib enzymes, the shifting should be even more pronounced, due to the long distance observed between the tyrosine and the diiron centre.

An interesting idea is that there might exist a triggering mechanism for radical transfer in R2 proteins that involves movement of the a-helix with the tyrosyl radical, which could possibly be facilitated by the binding of R1. Such ° movements might be in the range 0.2 to maximum 1 A, but probably, the movements are not so large as observed in the classical movement of a-helix F of hemoglobin upon ° binding of oxygen (1 A). At this point, we can really not exclude backbone movements in the R2 proteins as explanation for the radical shifts. 3.6. Reprogramming of the diiron centre The tyrosyl radical in class I RNR was the first known example of a biologically essential organic radical in any protein, and RNR has therefore served as a reference for

several other radical proteins. Protein radicals have now been observed in several systems: tyrosine radicals in photosystem II [199], bovine liver catalase [200,201], prostaglandin H synthase [202]; tryptophan radicals have been observed in cytochrome c peroxidase [203] and DNA photolyase [204]; glycine radicals in pyruvate formate lyase [205], and benzylsuccinate synthase [78]. There are also examples of radicals on modified amino acids, e.g. the joint tyrosine-cysteine residue in galactose oxidase [206], and possibly a tyrosine-histidine radical in cytochrome c oxidase [207,208]. It is the diiron centre of class I RNRs that is responsible for generating the stable tyrosyl radical. The diiron centre of RNR R2 possesses a strong oxidation power, it is capable of oxidizing a tyrosine residue, Y122 in E. coli, to a tyrosyl radical following the reactivation with dioxygen.

In S. cerevisiae Y2, a Zn ion (white sphere) is coordinated to one of the metal sites.

ly, the oxidizing power of the diiron centre is directed selectively to the tyrosine site in the wild-type R2 protein. The tyrosyl radical in R2 is also unusually stable for an organic radical, which is attributed to the very weak exchange interaction with the diiron-oxygen centre, as well as to its shielded position in a hydrophobic pocket within the protein, preventing the access of most radical scavengers from the surrounding medium [209]. However, in structurally related diiron proteins, like methane monooxygenase, the diiron centre fulfils entirely different functions, like hydroxylation and desaturation of fatty acids [11]. Therefore, by mutation of amino acid residues near the iron site, the R2 protein has been reprogrammed to perform different tasks, such as hydroxylation [191,210 ­212] and generation of novel radical species, including sulfinyl [213], tryptophanyl [126,148,214,215] and peroxyl [216] radicals. These studies provide detailed information on the finetuning of the diiron centre, and have contributed to the understanding of the oxygen reactivation process in R2, and related proteins. The R2 protein, in other words, seems to be

an ideal system for generation of stable protein radicals. The redox potential at neutral pH (E0V of tyrosine is about 0.8­ ) 1.0 V, and for the other amino acid residues it ranges from 1.0 V for tryptophan to 1.3 V for cysteine [5]; a similar value is expected also for histidine [217]. No redox potential is known for the FeIIIFeIV state of R2, however, it might well be high enough to oxidize amino acid residues with a redox potential slightly higher than tyrosine. A series of R2-Y122X mutants, or the equivalent R2Y177X in the mouse protein, have been generated by sitedirected mutagenesis, with X representing phenylalanine (F), tryptophan (W), cysteine (C), or histidine (H). These mutants should provide new information on radicals in a protein environment, and as an alternative to the tyrosine radical in wild-type R2, may even show some catalytic activity as a temporal electron acceptor during substrate turnover in the R1 subunit. The E. coli mutant R2-Y122F has been known for several years to produce a stabilized high-valence diiron centre, intermediate X [132]. In later studies, several other

transient radical species have been observed as oxidation products of intermediate X; two of these radicals were assigned to neutral tryptophan radicals on W111 and W107, which are also located near the iron site [214,218]. The electronic structure of W111. was characterized using ENDOR spectroscopy [219]. In the double mutant Y122F/ W107Y, a novel tyrosyl radical was generated on Y107, with g-values indicating a very strong hydrogen bond (Table 3) [150,220]. In the mouse R2-Y177W mutant, a tryptophan radical was actually generated at the desired position and characterized by ENDOR, but no catalytic activity could so far be detected [215]. These three different tryptophan radicals have also been studied by high-field EPR at Wband, where the g-tensors and h-proton hyperfine couplings are better resolved [148] (Table 3).

4. RNR in cancer and disease Large amounts of deoxyribonucleotides are required in proliferating cells during the S-phase of the cell cycle where the duplication of the genome takes place, whereas in the other phases the requirement is low. The level of RNR in mammalian cells is therefore closely linked with the cell cycle and growth control mechanisms. Enzyme activity and the R1 and R2 mRNAs reach maximal levels during Sphase [221,222]. The R1 protein has a half-life of more than 20 h and is in excess during the cell cycle. The R2 protein, in contrast, shows an S-phase specific expression and has a shorter half-life of about 3 h, probably regulated by a controlled degradation [223]. A possible link between R2 and the cell cycle regulatory proteins has been searched for, but so far it has only been suggested that such a link exists [169,224,225]. A direct link such as a binding site for one of the member of the E2F transcription factor family has not yet been identified in mammals. However, such a link has been identified in plant cells [226]. A second R2 subunit, called p53R2, has been identified in human and mouse cells [39]. p53R2 is induced by the key signalling protein p53, and it is suggested that p53R2 is important for supplying deoxyribonucleotides to the DNA damage repair system in phases of the cell cycle where the normal RNR is not functional. As much as 80% of human tumours have been found to contain mutations in p53 or pathways that either regulate or are regulated by this protein. The discovery of p53R2 thus created a link between one of the most important tumour suppressors and the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. Recently, it was reported that p53 binds both the R2 and p53R2 subunit in resting cells but, upon exposure to UV irradiation, they dissociated from p53 and bound to R1. Perhaps the regulation of RNR activity by p53 is more complex than only activation of p53R2; however, how this might affect cell cycle progression is not clear [227]. A study using p53R2 knockout mice showed the importance of p53R2 in DNA repair [228]. These mice had severe alterations in the dNTP pools in

kidney cells suffering from oxidative stress. This imbalance in the dNTP pool presumably resulted in higher mutation rate in the kidney cells. Most of the p53R2 knockout mice died by the age of 11­ 12 weeks and had abnormalities in the kidney and several other organs. They also found that cells lacking p53R2 were more susceptible to oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide than cells containing p53R2 thus further strengthening the role of p53R2 in DNA repair [228]. The increased interest in RNR following the discovery of p53R2 has not so much been the role of RNR in cancer development, but rather as a target for cancer treatment. In a recent review by Eklund et al. [7], the possibility of designing specific inhibitors to the normal RNR is discussed. The argument is based upon the fact that cancers often have mutations in the p53 pathway and thus presumably are unable to make p53R2. As all cells are dependent on the supply of deoxyribonucleotides, cancer cells would die if the normal RNR were inhibited, whereas normal cells with p53 could survive on the deoxyribonucleotide pool supplied by p53R2. This appears as a good strategy, but unfortunately the picture seems to be more complex. Some preliminary studies we have done on breast cancer cells with mutations in p53 showed that in some cell lines, p53R2 is present throughout the cell cycle and also in relatively high amount (P. Graff, E.O. Pettersen, and K.K. Andersson, unpublished data). This implies that there might exist an additional p53-independent induction pathway for p53R2. Also, a recent study on the response of p53R2 in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents showed that cells with mutated p53 might still induce p53R2, suggesting a p53independent pathway for activation of p53R2 [229], supporting our preliminary findings. The authors examined whether p53R2 could be used as a tumour suppressor (by having an apoptotic potential), but failed to take into account that increasing levels of RNR might raise the malignant potential of tumours [230,231]. This shows how complex the control of DNA repair and deoxyribonucleotide synthesis is with respect to cancer development and that it is not straightforward to use p53R2 strategies in cancer treatment. The interest in the connection between RNR and cancer, however, is older than the discovery of p53R2. For over 10 years, specific inhibitors of RNR such as hydroxyurea and substrate analogues, such as the suicide inhibitor Gemcitabine [232], have been used in the treatment of cancer, e.g. chronic myelogenous leukaemia and advanced cancer of the cervix. So far, they are promising against several human cancers, such as head, neck, and lung cancers [35]. Is there any connection between RNR and cancer, and if so, what processes are involved? To answer this, it might be of interest to establish whether an increased amount or an undue presence of the protein will give rise to an abnormal cell growth. In a simplified manner, it might be argued that an increased level of RNR would produce more deoxyribo-

26

nucleotides, and thus drive the cells faster through DNA synthesis and S-phase, increasing the probability of mutations. However, according to Chabes and Thelander [223], the production of deoxyribonucleotides is primarily regulated by the relative level of dATP/ATP, and not by the amount of RNR. This would imply that an increased level of RNR would have no effect on the cells. However, a study by Kashlan et al. [233] found that even under low ATP concentrations RNR retained some activity. These authors also noted the limiting levels of R2 normally present in the cells, and suggested that the R1 complex is unlikely to be saturated with R2 even when R2 levels are at its maximum in S-phase. This would imply an increased amount of R2 could increase the production of dNTPs. But even if the cellular ATP levels mainly regulate RNR activity, these findings are not necessarily in contradiction to the assumption that more RNR will produce more deoxyribonucleotides. It is of importance, however, to take into account the microenvironment in which the cells exist. First, we have to keep in mind that the level of RNR tyrosyl radical detected in human cells is dependent upon the oxygenation of the cells, where the radical disappears when the cells are deprived of oxygen [234]. Second, a low oxygen level, i.e. hypoxia, is a common environmental stress, and is known to be an important component of many physiological and pathological conditions [235]. In cancers there are smaller or larger areas of severe hypoxia, which may be chronically hypoxic due to abnormalities in the development of the capillary network in such tumours. But even in normal tissues, oxygen tension varies and acute hypoxia appears regularly due to transient occlusion of small blood vessels. The presence of hypoxia in tumours seems to promote development of aggressive phenotypic traits. It has been hypothesized that hypoxia causes a physiological stress in tumours, where cell subpopulations with a high proliferative capacity survive, which in turn may have an increased metastatic potential [236]. When the breast cancer cell line T-47D is exposed to moderate hypoxic conditions (0.13% O2), the cells are arrested in the cell cycle progression in late G1 or in Sphase. Upon reoxygenation, the T-47D cells do not continue their cell cycle progression immediately, but are delayed for some time in the S-phase [169]. This arrest might allow time for DNA repair prior to a restart of DNA synthesis. However, human cancer cells with an increased level of RNR R2 resume their S-phase progression faster upon reoxygenation after exposure to moderate hypoxia than cells with a normal level of RNR [169]. Cells are thus given less time for DNA repair, which could result in an increased probability of mutations. This indicates how an increased level of RNR might raise the malignant potential of tumours [230,231]. How the increased level of RNR reduces the lag time after hypoxia is not understood. However, the simplified assumption that an increased level of RNR would produce more deoxyribonucleotides, and thus drive the cells through

DNA synthesis, might be the explanation. In a hypoxic environment where the activity of RNR is hampered due to lack of oxygen, the level of RNR, and not the level of dATP/ ATP, might regulate the production of deoxyribonucleotides. Thus, an increased level of RNR would result in more deoxyribonucleotides, which might drive the cells faster through DNA synthesis than with normal supplies of RNR. This would imply that the replication machinery in the cells is able to detect the level of deoxyribonucleotides, as has been suggested to occur when exogenous deoxynucleotides are supplied [237]. The finding that when the cervix cancer cell line, NHIK 3025, is exposed to moderate hypoxia, the cells are able to continue their DNA synthesis when supplied with deoxyribonucleotides also supports this line of reasoning [238]. The question still remains whether p53R2 could have the same capability of increasing the malignant potential of a tumour as R2. It has been proposed that a loss of p53R2 would lead to abrogated DNA repair, but can an increased level of p53R2 be as dangerous as an increased level of R2? Unfortunately, it is very difficult to separate the EPR signal from the tyrosyl radical in R2 and in p53R2, as they are very similar [169,239]. This makes it difficult to determine whether it is the S-phase R2 protein or the p53R2 protein that is measured when cells are treated with different DNA damaging conditions from the literature. Some of these earlier studies might have to bee re-examined to clarify the role of R2 and p53R2 in the cells stress response and cancer development. Another finding that connects RNR and cancer is the observation that there might be a connection between RNR inhibition and the increased levels of nitric oxide (NO) found in tumours. This negative regulation of RNR by NO is suggested to be important in the immune system, but much of the physiologic consequence of these findings is still unclear. It is found that both subunits of RNR are inhibited by NO supplied either by NO-releasing molecules or by nitric oxide synthase activity. In the R1 subunit a nitrosation of the cysteines was observed [240], and in the R2 subunit the tyrosyl radical was inhibited by NO [240,241]. Even if it is shown that NO can inhibit RNR activity, it is not likely to assume that the inhibition of RNR is the only candidate for the antiproliferative activity of NO, as NO affect so many biochemical pathways in the cells. In the future, the correlation between RNR activity/ expression, p53 status, NO, and apoptosis/cell proliferation will be better understood, as NO and RNR have tight connections in cells. These very recent findings regarding novel isoforms of the enzyme RNR and their relation to the fundamental cancer regulating protein p53, NO, and certain viral infections, open up for unique ways for designing more effective cancer and anti-viral (and anti-bacterial) drugs. Furthermore, the R1-RNR is reported to be important in spindle body activation at the onset of mitosis [242,243] so more surprising findings about the RNR proteins might be

expected. Deeper understanding of the Class III RNR and its precursors will give important information about the transition into the DNA world.
