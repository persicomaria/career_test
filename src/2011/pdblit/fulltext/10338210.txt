Crystal Structure of Scallop Myosin S1 in the ° Pre-Power Stroke State to 2.6 A Resolution: Flexibility and Function in the Head
S. Gourinath, Daniel M. Himmel,1 Jerry H. Brown, Ludmilla Reshetnikova, Andrew G. Szent-Gyorgyi, ¨ and Carolyn Cohen* Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center Brandeis University Waltham, Massachusetts 02454 smooth muscle MD-essential light chain (MDE) crystal structures (Houdusse et al., 2000; but see Xiao et al., 2003; ° and below); the relatively low resolution ( 3.5­3.8 A) of these structures has precluded an atomic description of this difference. In the internally uncoupled state, the SH1 helix is unwound and the converter/lever arm module is uncoupled from the motor, but thus far a crystal structure of this myosin state has only been observed for scallop. Recently, a rigor-like conformation (which would constitute a fourth state) of the head--although not bound to actin--has been determined in myosin V (Coureux et al., 2003; see also Reubold et al., 2003). Here we report the structure of scallop S1 complexed ° with the transition state analog MgADP·VO4 at 2.6 A resolution (hereon termed ScS1-ADP·VO4) in the prepower stroke conformation; with this result all three conformational states of the intact head in scallop myosin can now be seen at relatively high resolution. A comparison of this structure with previous ones reveals additional aspects of the conformational states of the contractile cycle: a hinge has been identified for the first time within the regulatory light chain near the end of the lever arm; differences in conformation and flexibility between isoforms at the MD/lever arm junction are accounted for at an atomic level; and an argument is given based on analysis of crystallographic temperature factors, together with previous biochemical studies, that the internally uncoupled state is present in diverse myosins.

Summary We have extended the X-ray structure determination of the complete scallop myosin head in the pre-power ° stroke state to 2.6 A resolution, allowing an atomic comparison of the three major (weak actin binding) states of various myosins. We can now account for conformational differences observed in crystal structures in the so-called "pliant region" at the motor domain-lever arm junction between scallop and vertebrate smooth muscle myosins. A hinge, which may contribute to the compliance of the myosin crossbridge, has also been identified for the first time within the regulatory light-chain domain of the lever arm. Analysis of temperature factors of key joints of the motor domain, especially the SH1 helix, provides crystallographic evidence for the existence of the "internally uncoupled" state in diverse isoforms. The agreement between structural and solution studies reinforces the view that the unwinding of the SH1 helix is a part of the cross-bridge cycle in many myosins. Introduction Three different weak actin binding conformations of scallop myosin subfragment-1 (S1), including its complete motor domain (MD) and lever arm, have been visualized in X-ray crystal structures: the so-called nearrigor, pre-power stroke, and internally uncoupled states (Houdusse et al., 1999, 2000; Himmel et al., 2002). Analyses of these and other myosin head (Rayment et al., 1993) or head fragment structures (Fisher et al., 1995; Smith and Rayment, 1995, 1996; Dominguez et al., 1998) have provided key information on how relatively small rearrangements of the four subdomains of the MD (upper and lower 50 kDa subdomains, N-terminal subdomain, and converter) coordinated with conformational changes in the single-stranded joints between them (switch II, relay, and SH1 helix) produce relatively large motions of the lever arm in the power stroke (Dominguez et al., 1998; Houdusse et al., 1999; Himmel et al., 2002). Although all myosins appear to have an overall similar design, there are isoform-specific differences related to specialized functions. For example, in the pre-power stroke state, the orientation of the lever arm relative to the MD differs by 65 between scallop S1 and chicken

Results and Discussion Comparison of Pre-Power Stroke State Structures The MD of the current ScS1-ADP·VO4 structure displays an overall topology that is very similar to that of other class II myosin isoforms in the pre-power stroke state, such as the MD in chicken smooth muscle MDE-MgADP· ° AlF4 (Dominguez et al., 1998) (Figure 1) (rmsd of 1.15A for 593 C atoms) and Dictyostelium MD-MgADP·VO4 ("Dict. ° VO4") (rmsd 1.26 A for 648 C atoms) (Smith and Rayment, 1996); the similarity also extends to the unconventional class I myosin-IE-MD-MgADP·VO4 from Dictyoste° lium ("MyoE") (Kollmar et al., 2002) (rmsd 1.26 A for 566 C atoms) despite its relatively low ( 35%) sequence homology with the scallop class II myosin MD. Significant differences between these MD structures, nevertheless, do occur and for the most part are situated in two distinct regions. One group in the two 50 kDa subdomains affects the actin binding surface: all four structures differ from one another in the conformations adopted by the actin binding loops which include residues 364­372, 401­413, and 564­579 (note scallop numbering is used in this manuscript unless otherwise indicated); moreover, the path of the upper 50 kDa subdomain's long "Helix O" in Dict.VO4 (Dicty residues 411­441, scallop numbering 416­446) is 5 different than in the other structures (probably due to a unique glycine residue), resulting in a somewhat more closed

Figure 1. Stabilizing Interactions in the SoCalled "Pliant Region"--the MD/Lever Arm Junction--in Scallop S1 (A) Displayed here is a schematic comparison between the pliant regions of the chicken smooth muscle MDE-MgADP·AlF4 structure (Dominguez et al., 1998) (gray, only the lever arm is shown) and scallop S1-MgADP·VO4 (the lever arm and motor domain are shown). These structures are superimposed by fitting the residues (765­773) immediately N-terminal to the "pliant region." The pliant region is straight in all scallop S1 structures but is bent in the chicken smooth muscle crystal structure (Dominguez et al., 1998) (also see text). The lever arm heavy chain is shown as a ribbon diagram in purple, and the motor domain is shown schematically with its subdomains (the 50 kDa upper and lower subdomains in red and pink, the N-terminal subdomain in blue, the converter in green, and the pliant helix in yellow). (B) As in (A) but from a perpendicular view and also showing the scallop light chains schematically (ELC in magenta, and RLC in light blue). (C) Magnified view of the pliant region of scallop S1 (in the same orientation as in [B] and including the ELC in magenta) shows the side chain interactions that appear to restrain the scallop pliant region from bending (salt bridges in red dashed lines, van der Waals contacts in blue dashed lines). These interactions are absent from the smooth muscle MDE crystal structure as a result of amino acid sequence differences from scallop myosin.

actin binding cleft. The second major difference in the pre-power stroke state MDs occurs in the N-terminal subdomain: in addition to conformational variations between all the class II myosin structures at the N terminus (residues 1­30), this segment together with the highly exposed "SH3 motif" (residues 30­75) is absent in MyoE and other class I myosins (Kollmar et al., 2002); moreover, the SH3 motif adopts an orientation in Dict.VO4 that is 10 ­15 different from that in the chicken MDE (Dominguez et al., 1998) and scallop S1 structures. Such a difference between isoforms also occurs in near-rigor state structures, where the proximity of the SH3 motif to the converter/lever arm module may modify the position of the lever arm at the end of the power stroke (see also Dominguez et al., 1998). The most striking difference among the conventional myosin pre-power stroke structures is the 65 differ-

ence in the orientation of the lever arm relative to the MD between the scallop S1 and chicken smooth muscle MDE crystal structures (Houdusse et al., 2000) (Figure 1). This difference is associated with a structural change in the so-called "pliant region" (scallop residues 774­ 781, chicken MDE residues 788­795), which is part of the heavy chain helix at the MD/lever arm junction. In chicken smooth muscle MDE, this solvent-exposed single-chain helix is kinked in the crystal structure (Dominguez et al., 1998) but appears less bent by solution studies (Xiao et al., 2003). By contrast, this region is straight in all three different crystal forms of scallop S1 (as reported here and in Houdusse et al., 1999, 2000; Himmel et al., 2002). This structural variation is thus probably due to sequence differences. The bent conformation of the lever arm in the chicken smooth muscle MDE crystal structure appears to be stabilized in part

Structure of Scallop Myosin S1 1623

by the interaction of a negatively charged helix of the ELC with a positively charged (albeit partially disordered) loop of the motor domain (Dominguez et al., 1998), but this loop has a net lower positive charge in scallop myosin. Sequence differences also occur within and immediately adjacent to the pliant region: scallop residues L778 and S779 are replaced in chicken smooth MDE with -branched residues isoleucine and threonine, respectively, which are less favorable for helix formation (Chou and Fasman, 1978). Moreover, certain residues that stabilize the straight heavy chain helix at the scallop MD/lever arm junction (i.e., a salt link between R777 and ELC E79, as well as a network of van der Waals contacts that include P725, I781, and M784; Figure 1) are replaced by shorter side chains in the chicken smooth muscle myosin sequence that cannot form the same linkages. Note that the HC-ELC salt link also cannot occur in Dictyostelium, and solution studies suggest that the MD/lever arm junction of this isoform adopts at least two different pre-power stroke conformations (Shih et al., 2000); similar studies have not yet been carried out for scallop myosin. It is plain that solution studies complement the crystallographic results by revealing other conformations accessible to the molecule in a particular state; these techniques (together with electron microscopy) are beginning to yield information on some of the dynamic pathways sampled by the lever arm in the contractile cycle of diverse species. Differences in the flexibility of the MD/lever arm junction between scallop and chicken smooth muscle myosins may have relevance as well for the conformations adopted by these regulated molecules in order to achieve their off state. In chicken smooth muscle heavy meromyosin and myosin, the two heads adopt different conformations and interact asymmetrically (Liu et al., 2003). Although an asymmetric off-state conformation is also suggested for scallop HMM from ADP binding data (Nyitrai et al., 2003), the precise head interactions in this isoform have not yet been visualized.

Figure 2. A Flexible Hinge within the RLC of the Lever Arm A superposition of the coordinates of the lever arms of four different scallop myosin head fragment crystal structures (by a least squares fit of the C-terminal domain of the ELC) reveals the existence of a flexible hinge that includes RLC Gly 82 (arrow) and the hook region of the adjoining heavy chain. In the crystal structure, this hinge separates a conformationally invariant three-domain portion of the scallop myosin lever arm (above) from a generally poorly ordered RLC N-terminal domain (below). The scallop lever arm structures displayed (heavy chains in thick lines, and light chains in thin lines) are from S1-MgADP·VO4 (brown), nucleotide-free S1 (Himmel et al., 2002) (red), S1-ADP·BeFx (Himmel et al., 2002) (cyan), and regulatory domain (Houdusse and Cohen, 1996) (dark blue).

A Hinge in the Lever Arm In addition to the joints within the MD and at the MD/ lever arm junction, we can now also visualize a hinge within the lever arm of scallop S1. A superposition of various scallop myosin structures (as reported here and in Xie et al., 1994; Houdusse and Cohen, 1996; Houdusse et al., 1999, 2000; Himmel et al., 2002; D.M.H., S. Mui, E. O'Neall-Hennessey, A.G.S.-G., and C.C., unpublished data) shows that this hinge is located between the N- and C lobes of the RLC and includes the nonhelical "hook" in the heavy chain (residues 824­826) and RLC residue Gly 82 (Figure 2). This glycine is conserved among myosin RLCs, and the hook in the adjacent heavy chain has been observed in all lever-arm-containing myosin crystal structures (scallop and chicken skeletal myosin), suggesting that this flexible hinge in the lever arm is a general feature in myosin. (Flexibility about residue N823 was predicted from molecular dynamics simulations [Offer and Knight, 1996] using the proteolytic scallop Ca2 -RD crystal structure [Xie et al., 1994].) The hinge allows the RLC N lobe to rotate by at least 10 with respect to the rest of the lever arm. The B factors

of the RLC N lobe are generally higher than in the rest of the lever arm, suggesting increased mobility of this lobe. A flexible hinge at this location may have a number of consequences. Flexibility within the lever arm may contribute, for example, to the capacity of the two heads of a myosin dimer to adopt orientations appropriate for binding to the actin filament (Chakrabarty et al., 2002). This hinge could account for part of the lever arm elasticity (Howard and Spudich, 1996) that would contribute to the compliance of the myosin crossbridge (see Houdusse and Sweeney, 2001). Another source of compliance may be found in the nearby flexible coiled coil at the head/rod junction of myosin (Li et al., 2003). In this respect, the RLC in the lever arm and the N terminus of the rod together appear to constitute a contiguous region of flexibility in myosin. Dynamics of the SH1 Helix The SH1 helix, a joint of the motor domain, remains intact in the near-rigor and pre-power stroke states of all structures so far determined, including those of scallop S1. In contrast, the unwinding of the SH1 helix, which defines the internally uncoupled state, has thus far been observed only in scallop crystal structures. The question

Mean normalized B factors for the -carbons of the SH1 helix (residues 693­707 in scallop numbering) are shown for crystal structures of various myosin isoforms. B factors are normalized about zero, so that positive values indicate more disorder than the standard region and negative values indicate less disorder. See Experimental Procedures for calculations. Notice that ATP analogs (indicated by " ") or ADP tend to elevate the mean B factor for the SH1 helix in all isoforms for which structural data is available. Thus, nucleotides which lead to unwinding of the SH1 helix in skeletal myosin solution studies and in the scallop crystal structures also may destabilize the helix in other isoforms. a Truncated motor domain structures.

arises as to whether this state may occur in isoforms other than scallop. Using short cross-linking reagents (Reisler et al., 1974; Wells et al., 1980), solution studies first demonstrated the nucleotide-dependent flexibility of the SH1 helix in skeletal myosins. These reagents cross-link two reactive thiols, "SH1" and "SH2," located at opposite ends of the SH1 helix. Since these reagents ° span from 3 to 14 A (Burke and Reisler, 1977; Wells et ° al., 1980), the 19 A long SH1 helix must unwind for cross-linking to occur. Cross-linking has been observed in internally uncoupled scallop S1 crystal structures, but the cross-link was found between SH2 and K705 (not SH1) (Himmel et al., 2002). (In recent scallop S1 solution studies, however, all the detectable cross-linking was between SH1 and SH2 [Nitao et al., 2003]. This discrepancy may be explained if the cross-linker in the scallop structures was directed toward K705 but had not formed a chemical bond with the lysine, a possibility that could ° not be excluded at the 2.8 A resolution of the crystallographic study [Himmel et al., 2002].) In a recent study with Dictyostelium myosin, cross-linking was also demonstrated if the residue in the "SH1 position" was mutated to a cysteine (Liang and Spudich, 1998). These findings suggest that unwinding of the SH1 helix in the internally uncoupled state may be a general feature of all myosin isoforms. Further evidence for this possibility comes from the current analysis of temperature factors (B factors) in myosin S1 crystal structures from scallop and other isoforms (Figure 3; Table 1). B factors in a well-refined structure are an indication of the degree of disorder or mobility of a structural element. For example, in the scallop internally uncoupled state, where most of the SH1 helix is disordered and the lever arm position is flexible (Houdusse et al., 1999; Himmel et al., 2002), the B factors are very high for both the relay (a motor domain joint controlling lever arm position) and for the remaining observed residues of the SH1 helix. In all myosin iso-

forms examined, the normalized B factors for the SH1 helix are very low in the pre-power stroke conformation with transition state nucleotides bound, and higher in

Figure 3. Increased Atomic Temperature Factors of the SH1 Helix and Relay in the Internally Uncoupled State of Scallop S1 The color ramp indicates the difference between the normalized crystallographic temperature ("B") factors of the current pre-power stroke state structure and those of the internally uncoupled scallop S1-MgADP·BeFx structure (Himmel et al., 2002): the residues shown in red have higher normalized B factors in the internally uncoupled state structure than in the pre-power stroke state structure, while those in blue have lower B factors. The displayed -carbon coordinates are of the current scallop pre-power stroke state structure and include only those residues modeled in both structures. Nearrigor structures with bound ATP analogs also show elevated B factors in the SH1 helix, suggesting less stability (see text).

the near-rigor apo-state. In the chicken smooth muscle pre-power stroke conformation (albeit with low resolution structures), the B factors for the helix increase if the transition state analog ADP·AlF4 is replaced with ADP·BeFx, an ATP analog, possibly indicating a partial destabilization of the helix. A similar effect is apparent in Dictyostelium MD near-rigor crystal structures, where the presence of ADP or ATP analogs elevates the SH1 helix B factors, compared to the near-rigor apo-state (Bauer et al., 2000). In these structures, the effect may be partially obscured, however, by truncation of the motor domain close to the SH1 helix. Nevertheless, these results show that the SH1 helix may be partially destabilized in vertebrate smooth muscle MDE as well as in Dictyostelium MD by the very nucleotides found to give rise to the internally uncoupled state in scallop myosin S1. Thus far, scallop myosin crystal structures provide the only examples of a direct correlation between biochemical and structural results. Although the internally uncoupled state is predicted in other isoforms by solution studies, the state has yet to be observed in myosin crystal structures other than scallop. This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the isoform and preparation-dependent stability of the SH1 helix. For example, the only available Dictyostelium crystal structures are of the truncated MD, where the SH1 helix is more stable than in intact S1 (Reynoso et al., 2001). Moreover, the cross-linking reaction is two orders of magnitude faster in scallop S1 than in skeletal myosin (Nitao et al., 2003), suggesting that the helix is more flexible in scallop. Isoform sequence differences that may account for this stability difference have been discussed elsewhere (Himmel et al., 2002). Another possible indication of this stability difference is that in the near-rigor state, the reactive thiols, SH1 and SH2, are less solvent accessible in chicken skeletal S1 than scallop S1 crystal structures (Table 2). The correlation between solvent accessibility and availability for cross-linking can be seen by comparing scallop solution studies with scallop crystal structures. In the solution cross-linking studies with scallop myosin, chemical modification of the SH2 thiol is inhibited when ADP·VO4 is bound, but the reaction proceeds in the presence of ATP analogs, ADP, or more slowly in the absence of nucleotide (Nitao et al., 2003). Consistent with this result, the thiol groups in the current scallop S1-ADP·VO4 structure are less solvent accessible than in other weak actin binding states of scallop S1 (Table 2). These observations suggest that, although the internally uncoupled state may occur in all myosin isoforms, scallop appears to be especially suitable for observing the state in a crystal structure. ° In summary, the 2.6 A resolution scallop myosin S1-

ADP·VO4 structure has allowed us to visualize isoformdependent interactions in the MD/lever arm junction, and a comparison between this and other structures has led to a number of new findings. We have described interactions which are likely to modulate the flexibility of the pliant region in different isoforms and have explained why the HC lever arm helix may bend less in scallop than in smooth muscle in this region. A hinge has been found in the myosin lever arm at the heavy chain helix hook between the N- and C lobes of the RLC; this flexible link may contribute to the elasticity of the lever arm (Howard and Spudich, 1996) and the compliance of the myosin crossbridge (see Houdusse and Sweeney, 2001). Comparison of the current myosin crystal structure with previous ones also suggests that the reactivity of the SH1 and SH2 cysteines in the vicinity of the SH1 helix may be related to the solvent accessibility of these thiols. B factor analysis also indicates that of the three weak actin binding states, the SH1 helix is most stable in the pre-power stroke state. By contrast, in the nearrigor state, the binding of nucleotide substantially increases the mobility of this motor domain joint, suggesting an intermediate precursor to the internally uncoupled state in which the SH1 helix unwinds. Taken together, the crystallographic and biochemical results are beginning to reveal some of the intermediate conformational states of myosin in the contractile cycle.
Experimental Procedures Crystallization and Data Collection S1 from scallop (Argopecten irradians) striated muscle myosin was prepared as described (Houdusse et al., 1999) in MOPS buffer at pH 7.0, 80 mM NaCl, 3 mM NaN3, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DDT, 0.2 mM MgADP, 0.2 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM leupeptin. Na3VO4 was added to this solution stepwise to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. Excess vanadate was removed by rapid dialysis against 20 mM MOPS buffer (pH 7.0), 80 mM NaCl, 3 mM NaN3, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DDT, 30 M MgADP, 15 M Na3VO4, and 0.5 mM leupeptin. The resulting "ScS1-MgADP·VO4" complex was crystallized in sitting drops by combining equal volumes (3 l) of protein solution with a precipitant solution containing 40 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0), 5 mM MgCl2, 30 M MgADP, 15 M Na3VO4, 6%­6.5% polyethylene glycol 8K, and 3%­3.5% glycerol. These drops were equilibrated against the precipitant solution and 80 mM NaCl. X-ray data were collected at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (beamline A1) at 100 K from two crystals cryopreserved in the above solution but with 15% PEK 8K and 21% glycerol. These crystals belong to space group ° ° ° P21(a 51.4 A, b 285.6 A, c 59.8 A, 114.5 ) with one molecule per asymmetric unit. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1993).

Water molecules were ¨ added manually in the final stages of refinement and were built in only where they were justified by hydrogen bonds and Fo-Fc electron density at or above the 3.0 contour level.

Improvements in the Scallop S1-MgADP-Vanadate ° Structure at 2.6 A ° The 2.6 A resolution data have permitted us to visualize a number of features of scallop S1-MgADP-vanadate that could not be seen ° using the previous 3.8 A resolution data (Houdusse et al., 2000). Using the higher resolution data, side chains could now be included, and an additional 101 residues were built, including 93 residues of the heavy chain and 4 residues from each of the light chains. Elsewhere, the current structure is essentially the same as that determined at lower resolution; heavy chain residues 16­24 and 598­605, as well as the N-terminal domain of regulatory light chain, required the most rebuilding. The structure still has breaks in the chain trace, especially in surface loops between the N-terminal and 50 kDa upper subdomain (200­211), in the actin binding loop connecting the 50 kDa upper and lower subdomains (627­642), and in the converter region (729­732). The electron density is well defined for the nucleotide and vanadate, including their oxygens, and is prominent for the relatively heavy vanadium and magnesium atoms (Figure 4).
