The X-ray crystal structures of the rat VDR ligand-binding domain complexed with 19-norvitamin D compounds that contain an adamantyl substituent at the side-chain terminus, 2a (ADTT), 2b (ADNY), and 2c (ADMI4) and a coactivator peptide derived from DRIP205 are reported. These compounds show a series of partial agonistic (10-75% efficacy)/antagonistic activities. All of these complexed receptors are crystallized in the canonical active conformation, regardless of their activity profiles. The bulky adamantyl side chain does not crowd helix 12 but protrudes into the gap formed by helix 11, loop 11-12, helix 3, and loop 6-7, thereby widening the ligand binding pocket. We suggest that these structural changes destabilize the active protein conformation and reduce its contribution to equilibrium among the active and inactive conformations. The coactivator peptide traps the minor active conformation, and the equilibrium shifts to the active conformation. As a result, these ligands show partial agonistic activities.
Introduction The hormonally active vitamin D metabolite 1,25(OH)2D3 expresses its function by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDRa, NR1I1),1-7 which is a ligand-regulated transcription factor and a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily.8,9 The VDR plays physiological roles in the regulation of the mineral homeostasis and proliferation, the differentiation, and the immune response of cells.10,11 Active vitamin D3 and some potent synthetic analogs have been used clinically to treat calcium and bone disorders such as osteoporosis and the skin disorder psoriasis.10,11 However, despite some degree of target selectivity, the further development of vitamin D analogs as medicines for the treatment of malignant tumors and autoimmune disorders and for selective bone formation has been limited because of the adverse effect of hypercalcemia.12-14 The development of VDR modulators with selectivity at the tissue level (i.e., SVDRM) to overcome this limitation has been awaited, and for this purpose, a search for VDR partial agonists/ antagonists is of great interest.59 Selective receptor modulators (SRM) exhibit agonistic or antagonistic activity in a cell and tissue context-dependent manner.15 In NRs without ligands (apo), both the active and the inactive conformations are in equilibrium. With a bound agonist (holo), NRs predominantly adopt the active conformation

to which coactivators16 are recruited, and chromatin remodeling17 and transactivation follow. When accommodating an antagonist, the receptors preferentially adopt inactive conformations that interact with corepressors,16 and transactivation is kept silent. When binding a SRM, NRs adopt both active and inactive conformations and therefore have the potential to interact with either coactivators or corepressors and exert partial activity. Therefore, the activity of SRM-bound receptors depends on the relative expression of coactivators and corepressors in a given cell environment. In the NR field, many antagonists and partial agonists have been developed as clinical medicines. For example, hydroxytamoxifen (OHT)18 and raloxifene (RAL)19 have been developed as selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs),15 the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone20 has been developed as an antihypertensive agent, and androgen receptor (AR) antagonists such as flutamide21 and bicalutamide22 have been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer. The X-ray crystal structures of these steroid hormone receptors complexed with their antagonistic and partially agonistic ligands have been determined.23-30 These crystallographic studies have revealed that the conformations of antagonist- and partialagonist-bound NRs are varied whereas agonist-bound NRs adopt the same canonical active conformation. In the VDR field, a few vitamin D analogs that have antagonistic activity, partial agonistic activity, or both have been reported, including compounds that contain a bulky alkoxycarbonyl group at the side-chain terminus, such as 5,31-34 compounds that have a methylene lactone structure in the side chain, such as 6,34-36 and their analogs,37-39 and nonsteroidal VDR modulators (Figure 1).40 However, the X-ray crystal structure of VDR complexed with an antagonistic ligand has never been reported, although a number of agonist complexes have been determined.41-49 We have designed and synthesized vitamin D derivatives that have the bulky adamantyl (AD) substituent at the terminus of side chains of various lengths50-53 (Figure 1). These compounds have partial agonistic activity

(10-75% efficacy), antagonistic activity, or both. In the present study, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of the rat VDR ligand-binding domain (LBD) complexed with AD 19-norvitamin D compounds with various side-chain lengths and various activity profiles (25-AD-25-hydroxyl (2a), 24-AD-24-hydroxyl (2b), and 26-AD-25-hydroxyl (2c) (Figure 1)) and an LXXLLcontaining coactivator peptide. In all of these ternary complexes, the VDR was found to adopt the canonical active conformation of NR, regardless of their activity profiles. These results provide a structural basis for VDR antagonism and partial agonism for the first time as well as supporting evidence of the general molecular mechanism of SRM that was previously suggested.15 Results Synthesis. We designed AD 19-nor-2-methylenevitamin D compounds as candidates for potential VDR partial agonists and antagonists because (1) the rigid, bulky side chain with the AD moiety together with the 22-double would interfere with H12 in the active conformation and (2) the 19-nor-2-methylene A-ring motif that was introduced by DeLuca's group54,55 promises a high VDR affinity that is important for antagonistic activity. It is also advantageous that the 19-norvitamin D moiety is chemically stable and easy to synthesize. New AD compounds, 2a and 2b, were synthesized by the methods shown in Scheme 1, which are essentially the same as the method that was previously reported for the synthesis of 26-AD-19-nor-vitamin D compounds including 2c.51 The C22 secosteroid unit and side-chain fragment were combined by the Julia coupling reaction. In the synthesis of 2a, the C22 aldehyde (8) was combined with side-chain sulfone 5d, whereas in the synthesis of 2b, the reversed pair of C22 sulfone (13b) and side-

chain aldehyde (7) was employed. The reductive elimination of the hydroxysulfone group via the acetate, followed by the deprotection of the hydroxyl groups, afforded the desired compounds. Crystal Structures. The crystals of rVDR LBD (116-423, 165-211) were grown in the presence of a ligand (AD compounds 2a-2c or 1) and a peptide containing the LXXLL motif that was derived from coactivator DRIP 205. The complexes of rVDR LBD with AD compounds 2a and 2b were readily crystallized in space group C2 and were refined to resolutions of 1.70 and 2.10 Å, respectively. In contrast, the complex of 2c was crystallized rather slowly (resolution 2.35 Å), which suggests that the ligand was accommodated in the LBP with its very minor conformation. The crystal data are given in the Supporting Information. The overall folds of rVDR LBD bound to 2a, 2b, and 2c (Figures 2A-C) are identical to each other and to those of the VDR complexes of the natural hormone (1)41,43 and its agonistic analogs.42,44-49 Contrary to our expectation, all three of these complexes adopted the canonical active conformation of the NR LBD, and the coactivator peptide bound to the coactivator recognition surface (AF-2 surface). The VDR complexes of AD compounds (2a, 2b, and 2c) are aligned at CR atoms with the complex of 1, which was crystallized in this study from the same recombinant rVDR LBD, with average root-mean-square (rms) deviations of 0.344, 0.262, and 0.385 Å, respectively. The ligands are accommodated in the ligand binding pockets (LBP), which are significantly widened at the tip of the side chains compared with the complex with the natural hormone (1). The volumes of the LBP with 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c are 942, 1040, 1092, and 1102 Å3, respectively. The LBP of the rVDR

LBD complexed with 2a is shown in Figure 2D in comparison with that of the 1,25(OH)2D3 complex. The ligand 2a (spacefilling model) is accommodated in its LBP but protrudes from that of the 1,25(OH)2D3 complex. Complex with 2a. 25-Adamantyl-25-hydroxyl compound 2a shows very potent partial agonistic activity, antagonistic activity, or both: 51 VDR affinity, 75% that of natural hormone 1; transactivation, EC50 ) 10-9 M, 15% efficacy compared to that of 1; and inhibition of the action of 1, IC50 ) 3 × 10-9 M. Regardless of 2a's potent antagonistic activity, the VDR complex of 2a adopts the transcriptionally active conformation. This active conformation complex is conceivably a minor component in the equilibrium with major inactive conformations and was trapped by the LXXLL peptide and was crystallized out. In accord with the high VDR affinity, ligand 2a is anchored strongly by three pairs of hydrogen bonds at its three hydroxyl groups as natural hormone 1: 1R-OH, Ser233 and Arg270 (2.81 and 2.98 Å, respectively); 3 -OH, Tyr143 and Ser274 (2.80 and 2.86 Å, respectively); 25-OH, His301 and His 393 (2.82 and 2.71 Å, respectively) (Figure 3A). The CR rms deviations of individual residues are shown in Figure 2E. (e0.24, 0.25-0.44, 0.45-0.74, 0.75-1.04, and g1.05 Å are yellow, orange, red, purple, and black, respectively.) Large rms

deviations are found in the loop parts. Specifically, CR rms deviations of loop 11-12 are most significant. The CR rms deviations are also significant at Ala148-Pro155 (the loop following H1), His367-Gln374 (loop 10-11), and L303-Lys311 (H7). However, the rms deviations of functionally important residues such as those on H12 and the signature region (highly conserved sequences among the NR family consisting of the C-terminus of H3, loop 3-4, and H4) are not noticeable. As described above, the LBP is widened around the part that is surrounded by the C-terminus of H11, loop 11-12, and the N-terminus of H3 (Figures 2D). Here, the side-chain conformations of three Leu residues, 223 (H3), 400 (H11), and 410 (loop 11-12), differ significantly from those of the 1,25(OH)2D3 complex (Figure 3D): rms deviations, Leu 223 C1 and C2 (2.79 and 2.53 Å, respectively); Leu400 C, C1, and C2 (2.12, 3.11, and 3.21 Å, respectively); Leu410 C1 and C2 (2.52 and 2.67 Å, respectively). We have shown by alanine scanning mutational analysis (ASMA)50 that these residues are important in the folding of the active conformation of the hVDR LBD. The widening of the LBP here may explain why compound 2a shows antagonistic activity. This weakens the interactions among the secondary structures here and destabilizes the active conformation. It has been reported that the volume of the hVDR

(D) Ligand 2a and three Leu residues (green stick with red oxygen) interacting with its AD moiety are overlaid with 1 and the same Leu residues (atom-type) in its complex.

LBP is not significantly changed when it binds superagonists with long, bulky side chains such as 342 and 4 (Figure 1).44 Complex with 2b. The 24-adamantyl-24-hydroxyl compound 2b, which has the shortest side chain of the three AD compounds, is a potential partial agonist of the VDR (VDR affinity is about 20% of that of 1; transactivation, EC50 ) 2 × 10-11 M; efficacy is 74% of that of 1).52 It forms three pairs of hydrogen bonds at its three hydroxyl groups (Figure 3B): 1ROH, Ser233 and Arg270 (2.76 and 2.91 Å, respectively); 3 OH, Tyr143 and Ser274 (2.96 and 3.00 Å, respectively); and 24-OH, His301 and His393 (2.93 and 2.55 Å, respectively). Compared with the 1,25(OH)2D3 complex, significant CR rms deviations are found in the residues that interact with the

adamantane moiety and the 24-hydroxyl group, H3 N-terminal (Leu226Asp228), H6 to loop 6-7 (Val296Leu303), H11 (Glu391Lys395), and loop 11-12 (Leu400-Pro404 and Ser407-Thr411) (Figure 2F). Again, the rms deviations of the residues that form the AF-2 surface are minimal. Complex with 2c. 26-Adamantyl-25-hydroxyl compound 2c has the longest side chain of the three compounds and shows potent antagonistic activity (compared with 1: VDR affinity, 1/20; transactivation, EC50 ) 2.4 × 10-8 M; efficacy, 10%; antagonistic activity, IC50 ) 3 × 10-8 M).51 Compound 2c is anchored in the LBP by two pairs of hydrogen bonds at the A-ring hydroxyl groups (Figure 3C): (1) 1R-OH, Ser233 and Arg270 (2.57 and 3.26 Å, respectively) and (2) 3 -OH, Tyr143

and Ser274 (2.67 and 2.90 Å, respectively). However, the sidechain hydroxyl group is not within hydrogen-bond distances from the two His residues (His301 and His393 (4.41 and 7.20 Å, respectively)). For this reason, 2c has a lower VDR affinity than the other two compounds. Because the 25-hydroxyl group is not fixed at H11 (His 393), the long and bulky side chain of 2c could be packed in the LBP and could adopt a significantly different conformation compared with 2a and 2b (Figure 3A-C). Compared with those of the 1,25(OH)2D3 complex, the CR rms deviations are significant at a part of loop 1-3 that faces the 3 -hydroxyl group (Thr146-Asp152), at H6 to loop 6-7 (Tyr291-Leu303), and at the H11 N-terminal to loop 11-12 (Ser394-Leu410) (Figure 2G). Discussion A number of crystal structures of NRs that are complexed with antagonists, partial agonists, or both have been reported.23-30 Whereas NRs that are bound to agonist ligands invariably adopt the same canonical active conformation, those that are bound to antagonists/partial agonists exhibit various conformations. When ERR binds RAL23 and OHT,24 the bulky side chains with the tertiary amine group protrude from the LBP opening and are fixed on H3 (Asp351), forming a salt bridge via the amine group. In this way, the bulky ligands directly inhibit H12 from adopting the active conformation. Instead, H12 binds to the coactivator recognition surface (AF-2 surface) that mimicks the LXXLL motif of the coactivator NR box by its LLEML sequence. ER adopts a slightly different conformation when it binds the partial agonist genistein (GEN)25 and the pure antagonist tetrahydrochrysene (THC) compound.26 These ligands do not have a bulky substituent and are easily accommodated in the LBP. Therefore, these ligands do not directly interfere with H12, but H12 does not adopt the active conformation. It is placed over the LBP in a position such that it occludes the AF-2 surface only partially, and the transactivation is suppressed. This type of antagonism has been termed "passive antagonism" by Shiau et al.26 as opposed to the active antagonism that was exhibited by RAL23 and OHT.24 The same ligands (GEN and THC) are similarly accommodated in the ERR, but here the H12 is in the active conformation, and the compounds act as agonists for ERR. It is reported that in the ER /THC complex, small differences (1.6-2.3 Å) in the positioning of residues on H11 cause this conformational and activity difference. So-called passive antagonists are rather common in other NRs such as progesterone and spironolactone for MR27,28 and flutamide and bicalutamide for AR.29,30 In the case of AR, it was possible to crystallize the complexes with antagonists only by mutating the residues that cause antagonism, and the mutant receptors were crystallized in the canonical active conformation. It was suggested that in the passive-type antagonist complexes the LBD body that accepts H12 is not properly folded so that H12 is not placed in the correct position for the active conformation. For the proper folding of the LBD body, the tight packing of H3 and H4/5 with the assistance of ligands and the correct positioning of H11 are believed to be important.26-30 We have investigated the structure-activity relationship of VDR ligands on the basis of their activity profiles in the 2D alanine scanning mutational analysis (2D ASMA) of all 34 VDR-LBP residues.50 In this study, we also analyzed the behaviors of the two VDR antagonists/partial agonists, 7 and 8 (Figure 1),50 compared with that of the full antagonist, 5, and we classified these antagonists/partial agonists into two groups simply by whether they have bulky substituent (type I, 8 and

5) or not (type II, 7). Two groups of compounds showed distinct behaviors in the 2D ASMA. The rVDR complexed with AD 19-norvitamin D compounds (2a-c), which show a series of partial agonistic (10-75% efficacy) to antagonistic activities, adopts the canonical active conformation; H12 is placed on the opening of the LBP, which forms the AF-2 surface to which the coactivator-peptide binds (Figure 2A-C). The bulky AD moiety does not crowd H12, as we proposed in our previous docking study,50-53 but protrudes into the gap that is surrounded by the H11 C-terminus, loop 11-12, the H3 N-terminus, and loop 6-7. As a result, in all of these complexes, the LBPs are expanded (Figure 2D). These results contrast those that were obtained from VDR superagonists with long and bulky side chains, such as 342 and 4 (Figure 1).44 These superagonists reportedly do not widen the receptor LBP. Because of its bulkiness and rigidity, the AD side chain forces a change in the conformations of the VDR at N-terminal H3, loop 6-7, and H11 to loop 11-12, and weakens the interaction among these secondary structures. This structural change would destabilize the active conformation and reduce its contribution in the equilibrium among various conformations of the complexes (Figure 4). Three AD 19-norvitamin D compounds (2a-2c) can be categorized as type I antagonists by our definition, but they are difficult to classify as either active- or passive-type antagonists. The schematic molecular mechanism in Figure 4 explains the activity profiles of the AD 19-norvitamin D series. The VDR LBD complexed with AD vitamin D ligands (2a-2c) adopts multiple relatively stabilized conformations (D, E, F, etc.). Whether the ligand exhibits agonist or antagonistic activity depends on the population of these conformations and the concentrations of coactivator (CoA) and corepressor (CoR) complexes under given cellular conditions. The population of the active conformation (F) would decrease in the order 2b > 2a . 2c; accordingly, the transcriptional activities would decrease in the same order. However, the transcriptional activities of these compounds (2a-2c) would be changed in a cell and tissue context-dependent manner following the equilibrium shown in Figure 4. If the CoA complex level is high, then the equilibrium between complexes F and H shifts to H, and agonistic activities would become predominant. If the CoA complex level is low, the CoR complex level is high, or both, then the whole equilibrium among complexes D to H would converge to G, and transactivation would be suppressed.15 Complexes of coactivators and corepressors possess sensing activities for multiple signaling pathways16 and thus the activities of VDR ligands are affected by cell signaling via the regulation of these coregulator levels. Conclusions The crystal structures of the rVDR LBD complexed with a series of AD 19-norvitamin D compounds (2a-2c) and a coactivator peptide derived from DRIP205 have been solved. These complexes adopt the canonical active conformation, and the coactivator peptide binds to the AF-2 surface, regardless of the partial agonistic/antagonistic activities of the ligands. We suggest that the rigid and bulky adamantyl side chain that protrudes into a gap formed by the H11 C-terminus, loop 11-12, the H3 N-terminus, and loop 6-7 weakens the interactions among these secondary structures and destabilizes the active conformation. As a result, the contribution of the active conformation in the equilibrium among multiple protein conformations is significantly reduced, and the transcriptional potencies of these compounds (2a-2c) are decreased.

results presented a structural basis for VDR antagonism and partial agonism for the first time. Experimental Section
General. All nonaqueous reactions were carried out under argon or nitrogen in freshly distilled anhydrous solvents. In all chemical reactions, the products underwent a general workup procedure that included extraction with organic solvents, solvent evaporation after drying the extracts over anhydrous MgSO4, and purification by column chromatography on silica gel. We conducted high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) by using Jasco 880-PU pumps equipped with an 801-SC solvent programmer and a Uvidec-100V variable-length UV-vis detector. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H and 13C) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution on a Bruker ARX 400 MHz spectrometer. Low- (MS) and high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained by electronic ionization (70 eV) on a JEOL JMS-AX505HA spectrometer.

affinity chromatography on a Ni-NTA column, followed by dialysis and ion-exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose). After tag removal by thrombin digestion, the protease was removed by filtration through a HiTrap benzamidine column, and the protein was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex200 column. The purity and homogeneity of the rVDR LBP were assessed by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization. Purified rVDR LBD solution was concentrated to about 0.75 mg/mL by ultrafiltration. To an aliquot (800 µL) of the protein solution was added a ligand (ca. 10 equiv); the solution was further concentrated to about 1/8, and then a solution (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 50 mM NaCl; 10 mM DTT; 0.02% NaN3) of coactivator peptide (H2N-KNHPMLMNLLKDN-CONH2) derived from DRIP205 was added. This solution of VDR/ligand/peptide was allowed to crystallize by the vapor-diffusion method that used a series of precipitant solutions containing 0.1 M MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.1-0.4 M sodium formate, 12-22% (w/v) PEG4000, and 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Droplets for crystallization were prepared by mixing 2 µL of complex solution and 1 µL of precipitant solution, and droplets were equilibrated against 500 µL of precipitant solution at 20 °C. It took 1 to 2 days to obtain crystals of X-ray diffraction quality for VDR complexes with 1,25(OH)2D3, 2a, or 2b as a ligand. Diffraction Experiment and Structure Analysis. Prior to the diffraction data collection, crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution that contained 0.1 M MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), 0.1-0.4 M sodium formate, 15-20% PEG4000, and 17-20% ethylene glycol. Diffraction data sets were collected at 100 K in a stream of nitrogen gas at beamlines BL-6A of KEK-PF and NW12A of PF-AR (Tsukuba, Japan). Reflections were recorded with an oscillation range per image of 1.0°. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the program HKL2000.56 The structures of the complex were solved by molecular replacement with the program CNS,57 and finalized sets of atomic coordinates were obtained after iterative rounds of model modification with the program XtalView58 and after refinement with CNS by rigid body refinement, simulated annealing, positional minimization, water molecule identification, and individual isotropic B-value refinement. We calculated the LBP volumes of the VDR/adamantyl vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D3 complexes by using the fast Connolly channel surface program of the SYBYL molecular modeling software (Tripos, St. Louis).
