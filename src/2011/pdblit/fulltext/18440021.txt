The molecular chaperone Hsp90 plays important roles in maintaining malignant phenotypes. Recent studies suggest that Hsp90 exerts high-affinity interactions with multiple oncoproteins, which are essential for the growth of tumor cells. As a result, research has focused on finding Hsp90 probes as potential and selective anticancer agents. In a high-throughput screening exercise, we identified quinoline 7 as a moderate inhibitor of Hsp90. Further hit identification, SAR studies, and biological investigation revealed several synthetic analogs in this series with micromolar activities in both fluorescent polarization (FP) assay and a cell-based Western blot (WB) assay. These compounds represent a new class of Hsp90 inhibitors with simple chemical structures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has emerged as an important biological target that modulates a variety of cellular processes including cell maturation, stability, and conformational maintenance of signature cancer proteins such as Akt, Raf-1, HER-2/ErbB2, and p53.1 Reports indicate that Hsp90 from stress-induced cells exhibits a higher affinity for small molecule inhibitors relative to normal cells as a result of increased refolding requirements of its mutated or altered clients.2,3 Thus, identification of selective tumor-specific Hsp90 inhibitors could lead to the specific targeting of cancer cells and circumvent systemic toxicities. The antibiotic geldanamycin (1a) and its synthetic analogs (17-AAG, 17-DMAG, 1b, 1c)4 were the first small molecules found to bind competitively to the ATP-binding pocket in the Hsp90 N-terminal domain and thereby prevent the ATP-mediated conformational change needed for protein­protein interactions of Hsp90 with its client polypeptides. While geldanamycin analogs are showing promising anticancer activity in clinical trials,5several other compounds either from natural or synthetic sources have also been identified (Fig. 1). Notable among these is the natural product radicicol (2),6 which exhibits potent in vitro Hsp90 inhibitory activity, but lacks in vivo efficacy. The first reported synthetic class of Hsp90 inhibitors was the purine-scaffold series, represented by PU3 (4).7 The

purine-scaffold was subsequently developed into the clinical agents PU-H71 (5)8 and CNF2024 (6).9 Very recently, the pyrazole/isoxazole class of compounds (3a and 3b) was discovered from high-throughput screening.10 All these known analogs utilize the same binding pocket as geldanamycin on Hsp90 (Fig. 1).8b,11,13 Two strategies have proven useful for identifying Hsp90 inhibitors. On one hand, structure-based design strategies were employed to develop potent analogs8,9,12 with X-ray templates of Hsp90­ligand complexes.13 On the other hand, high-throughput screening (HTS) methods are being investigated to find novel chemical scaffolds.14 In the present study, we employed a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay15 to identify a new class of Hsp90 inhibitors by HTS. The aminoquinoline 7 was identified as a marginally active Hsp90 inhibitor hit. Structure validation, re-synthesis, and structure­activity relationship (SAR) studies led to several aminoquinoline analogs as low micromolar inhibitors of Hsp90. The best compound 10 exhibits low micromolar activities in both primary FP and cell-based Western blot (WB) assays (Fig. 2). Hit identification, synthesis, SAR and bio-structural analysis of the quinoline derivatives are described in detail below. 2. Results and discussion Various bioassays have been developed to identify novel inhibitors of Hsp90.16 Most of these assays are amenable to HTS, since they report the interaction of a small molecule with recombinant Hsp90-a or -b. These proteins are derived from yeast or human

normal cells, respectively, in which Hsp90 is found to be in a latent, low-affinity form, compared to the high-affinity state present in tumor cells.17 One way to determine the therapeutically relevant state of Hsp90 is to develop an assay that makes use of human cancer cell derived lysates, instead of recombinant protein. The former permits direct measurement of the interaction between small molecule and tumor-specific Hsp90. Such an assay is capable of leading to identification of molecules that are specific for tumor cell Hsp90. By employing a recently developed FP assay for HTS,15 we have identified a highly promising compound, namely 7, for follow-up by chemistry and molecular modeling.18 2.1. Hit identification In a high-throughput screening, it has become common for molecules with known biological activities to emerge as modulators of novel targets.19 One example in the present work is the anti-malarial agent quinocide-dihydrochloride, namely 8-(4-aminopentylamino)-6-methoxyquinoline-dihydrochloride (7),20 which appeared as a novel scaffold in the modulation of Hsp90 (Fig. 2). This compound showed activities in the low micromolar range in both FP and WB assays (Table 1). The FP assay measures the interaction of Cy3b-conjugated geldanamycin with Hsp90 in tumor cell lysates for identifying ATP-binding inhibitors. Hsp90 uniquely stabilizes the Her2/Hsp90 association.21 Addition of Hsp90 inhibitors to cancer cells induces the proteasomal degradation of a small sub-

tion in cancer cells is indicative of a selective biological effect in these cells via Hsp90. We used a WB-based assay to measure the cellular level of Her2 protein in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lysates collected after 24 h of compound treatment. The original hit compound 7 was re-synthesized in both neutral and dihydrochloride salt forms as previously reported.22 Surprisingly, both synthesized forms of 7 showed only moderate biological activity (IC50: $30 lM in FP assay) in both assays by comparison to the original sample (SID 850375, collected from Discovery Partner International (DPI) as part of MLSCN). As the purities of both synthetic and original DPI sample for 7 were checked by LC/MS, the original DPI sample showed about 60% purity, while the re-synthesized compound was about 97% in purity. The biological activity of the original sample of 7 was believed to arise partially from degradation products present in the original DPI library sample, which will be detailed in a separate publication. Nevertheless, the structure of 7 serves as a starting point for analog identification. One of the advantages of compound 7 is that many analogs of this scaffold (aminoquinolines) are available for SAR from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collection. To take advantage of this collection, we performed 2D-tanimoto similarity searching on a structural database consisting of 250,000 compounds available from the NCI.23 2D descriptors were assigned to the NCI database using the MDL public keys SciTegic's Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP_6) available in Pipeline Pilot.24 Threshold similarity was set to 60% to introduce alternative scaffolds into the pool. Thirty-five compounds were identified and ordered from NCI and tested in both FP and WB assays. In addition, design and synthesis for some aminoquinolines were also executed through Schemes 1 and 2. These compounds were segregated into 2-subclasses;

namely, 8-alkylaminoalkyl-6-methoxy-quinolines and 8-alkylaminoalkyl-6-hydroxyl-quinolines as shown in Figure 3. Table 1 summarizes estimated in vitro binding affinities to Hsp90 as well as the ability to prevent Hsp90 interaction with Her2 in the WB assay, leading to the degradation of Her2. 2.2. Chemistry and SAR-analyses of aminoquinolines Compound 8 with a 2-carbon linker between the quinoline moiety and diisobutyl amine is the only active compound in the series. Replacing the isobutyl groups on the terminal amine of 8 with ndibutyl, diethyl, and diisopropyl units (8a­c) (Scheme 1) eliminates the activities in both FP and WB assays. Likewise, 19a (with sec-butyl group) and 19b (with one ethyl and one sec-pentyl groups) show activity only in the FP assay, but fail to show a response in WB assay, indicating the importance of diisobutyl groups on the terminal nitrogen. Increasing the chain length to 3­4 carbons while swapping the alkyl groups on the terminal nitrogen also eliminates activity (cf. 19c­d), suggesting the importance of the 2-carbon linker. Likewise 9 with a 3-carbon linker, an extra hydroxyl group on the middle carbon and a methyl group at the quinoline C-2 position shows sixfold less activity in the FP assay and threefold less in the WB assay compared to 8. Thus, longer the linkers appear to impair activity in this series. Likewise 19k with a 3carbon linker, but with additional appendages (anilino, PhN) at the quinoline C-5 position shows mixed effects. Compound 19k shows twofold increased activity in FP assay and threefold decreased activity compared to 8, which suggests that a 2­3 carbon linker is optimal for the 6-methoxy quinoline series. Supporting this interpretation, compounds 19d­e, 19h­j with 4­5 carbon tethers

were found to be inactive or much less active compared to 8. Substitutions around the quinoline moiety also resulted in complete loss of activity (cf. 19l­m, 19f­19j). From the 6-hydroxyl-8-aminoquinilone series (Figs. 2 and 3 and Scheme 2) only two compounds 10 and 11 show promising activity. In this series, contrary to the methoxy quinoline series, the longer linkers promote activity. Compound 10 exhibits nearly twice the binding affinity of 11 in the FP assay and eightfold more active in the WB assay. The difference between these two compounds is only the alkyl groups on the terminal nitrogen. The former (compound 10) possesses two ethyl groups compared to the latter (compound 11), which incorporates only one isopropyl group. This result is consistent with the findings for the methoxy quinoline series and clearly suggests that di- alkyl substituents on the terminal nitrogen are very important for activity, especially in the WB assay. The latter observation also operates when 10 is compared with 20a­g, which do not bear substituents on the terminal nitrogen and show no activities in the WB assay, despite the fact 20a­g proved to be highly active in the competitive-binding assay (Table 1). To assure that the activities observed with the most active compounds (8, 10, and 11) were truly due to the structures assigned by NCI, the compounds were re-synthesized in our laboratory as shown in Schemes 1 and 2. Compounds 8, 10, and 11 have very similar structures to hit compound 7 with only slight changes in the length of the linker, alkyl groups on the amine tail and the free hydroxy group instead of methoxy group in some cases. Compound 8 was prepared as shown in Scheme 1. Diisobutylamine was reacted with bromoethanol to obtain 2-(N,N-diisobutyl)-ethanol 12, which was treated with triphenyl phosphine and iodine in the presence of imidazole to provide 2-(N,N-diisobutyl)ethyl iodide 13. Condensation of 13 with 6-methoxy-8-aminoquinoline 14 in the presence of triethylamine provided compound 8. Similarly, derivatives 8a­c with different alkyl groups on the amine nitrogen and a longer chain analog 8d were also obtained in the same way. The syntheses of 10 and 11 were carried out as shown in Scheme 2. 6-Methoxy-8-amino-quinolin 14 was treated with excess bromoalkylnitrile in a mixed solvent of triethylamine and methanol under refluxing for more than 48 h to obtain nitrile compound 15 in low to moderate yields. Reduction of 15 with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) afforded the terminal amine 16, which

was further alkylated by reductive-amination with either acetaldehyde or acetone to deliver 17a­c. Deprotection of methoxy analogs 17 delivered hit compounds 10, 11, and their analogs 18a. As shown in Figure 4, the resynthesized 10 was highly active in FP assay with an IC50 around 0.73 lM in a representative experiment. Importantly, this compound appeared to be able to enter cells and exerted a potent activity to induce Her2 degradation with an average IC50 of 1.0 lM (0.8 lM in a representative assay as shown in Fig. 5). 2.3. Discussion An ideal small molecule probe should bind effectively to tumor Hsp90, after which a conformational change will lead to disruption of the Hsp90-client protein interaction and client degradation as observed in Western blots. In the present study, Western blots have been performed for Her2 degradation, to monitor client protein interaction with Hsp90. Her2 shows greatest sensitivity, and it was selected as diagnostic in the current study. Compounds 20b­k have shown potent activity in the FP assay with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, but failed to demonstrate activity in the WB assay.26 Poor membrane permeability might account for the different behaviors in the cell-free and cell-based assay.

MCF7 cells were treated with test compounds for 24 h before being lysed for Western blot analysis with antibodies to Her 2 and Hsp90. (B) The dose-curve of compound 10 in Her2 degradation assay. The density of each band in Western blot from (A) was quantified. Data were normalized to total Hsp90 protein level and then normalized to the vehicle (DMSO) control well. Data shown are from one representative of 6 independent experiments. Compound 5 was used as a positive control and was tested at 60­130 nM.

Among all the analogs, 8­11 obtained from NCI showed promising activity in both FP and WB assays. Compounds 8 and 9 both feature a 6-methoxy group on the quinoline moiety, while 10 and 11 share a common scaffold with 6-hydroxyl substitution. Compounds 8 and 9 were obtained as dihydrochloride salts and, 10 and 11 were available as dihydrobromide salts. These analogs not only inhibited the binding of labeled geldanamycin to Hsp90 with IC50 values in the range of 1­5 lM (except 9 which showed IC50 = 29 lM) but also induced degradation of Her2 with activities in the low micromolar range. Resynthesised compound 10 exhibits activity in both FP and WB assays, however, synthesized versions of 8 and 11 had only marginal activities in either the FP or WB assays. It is difficult to pin down causes of the discrepancy, when both samples showed similar analytic data. However, minor undetectable impurities present in the NCI sample due to long-term storage in DMSO could potentially account for the discrepancy. Gratifyingly, resynthesized compound 10 shows consistent activities in both FP assay and cell-based WB assay with IC50 values in low micromolar range ($1 lM). 2.4. Biostructural analysis We have hypothesized that aminoquinolines bind to the N-terminal region based on their activity in the in vitro FP assay, which

suggests that they bind competitively with the known N-terminal inhibitor, geldanamycin. It is possible that the aminoquinolines are able to influence the N-terminal ATP-binding site from an allosteric location. However, no such site has been identified at this time, though through space communication between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions is being explored. The binding modes of five N-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor classes have been solved by Xray crystallography and were used as a guide to model the aminoquinolines into the N-terminal ATP-binding site.11­13,8b Despite the wide conformational and functional diversity, they share three common pharmacophore sites: hydrophobic cluster, hydrogenbonding acceptor, and hydrogen-bonding donor. Hsp90 inhibitors interact with a hydrophobic cluster consisting of residues M84, L93, F124, Y125, and V136 (Numbering based on Protein Databank (PDB) code: 2BRE27). (Fig. 6). The two other common pharmacophore sites involve an H-bond donor and an H-bond acceptor (T171 and D79, respectively). Other hydrogen-bonding interactions are observed as well, but these two appear most consistently in analysis of all available co-crystals (Fig. 7). The GLIDE protocol (Schrodinger Inc.)28 was used to dock 10 into the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90. No constraints were implemented during the docking calculation. Receptor-site coordinates were derived from the Protein DataBank of 2BRE. Rendering for all pictures was generated using PyMol (DeLano Scientific).29

As shown in the figure, the pyrazole interacts only with the surface of the hydrophobic cluster while the purine buries a benzodioxazole deep into the hydrophobic cluster.

Compounds 8a­8d were synthesized by using the same method as for synthesis of compound 8 3. Conclusions In an HTS campaign, we identified compound 7 as an inhibitor of Hsp90 with modest activity. SAR-study yielded 3 highly active derivatives (8, 10, and 11) by FP assay, which all show IC50 values in low micromolar range. These compounds also enhance degradation of the Hsp90 client proteins, for instance, Her2, as demonstrated by a cell-based Western blot assay. However, after resynthesis and biological testing of synthesized materials only one compound, namely 10, demonstrated consistent activities in both FP assay and WB assay with low micromolar (1 lM) activities. The use of compound 10 as a lead for further SAR exploration could yield optimized and therapeutically useful molecules. 4. Experimental 4.1. 2-(Diisobutylamino)ethyl iodide (13) To a solution of 2-(diisobutylamino)ethanol (12) (3 mmol) in ether and acetonitrile (3:1, 12 ml) was sequentially added imidazole (0.6 g, 9 mmol) followed by triphenyl phospine (1.2 g, 4.5 mmol) and iodine (1.5 g, 4.5 mmol) at 0 °C. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred for a further 30 min. The reaction was quenched with Na2S2O3 solution and the reaction mixture portioned between ether and water. The organic layer was separated and after the usual workup, the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography to give the title compound 13 (60% yield). 1H NMR: (400 MHz, CDCl3): d 3.09 (t, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 2.74 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 2H), 2.12 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 4H), 1.64 (m, 2H), 0.86 (d, J = 6.4 Hz, 12H). 4.2.

N1,N1-Diethyl-N4-(6-methoxyquinolin-8-yl)butane-1,4diamine (17b) To a solution of compound 15a (1.0 mmol, 1 equiv, 255.31 mg) in THF (5 ml) was added LAH (2.0 mmol, 2 equiv, 1.0 M in THF) dropwise at À78 °C. Reaction mixture was kept at this temperature for an additional 2 h, which was then allowed to slowly warm up to room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of NaHCO3 (satd aq), extracted by EtOAc (3Â 5 ml), combined the organic layer and washed with brine. Dried over Na2SO4 and evaporated off the solvent to obtain crude compound 16b as an oily residue, which was subjected to the next step without further purification. To a solution of crude compound 16b in 5 ml of CH2Cl2 at 0 °C was added acetaldehyde (85 lL, 1.52 mmol). Reaction mixture was kept at 0 °C for about 30 min, and then NaBH(OAc)3 (350 mg, 1.65 mmol) was added to the above mixture. The resulting solution was allowed to warm to room temperature for another 3 h. The mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (30 ml) and sequentially washed with 10% NaHCO3 and brine.
