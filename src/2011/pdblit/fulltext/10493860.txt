The crystal structure of subtilisin BL, an alkaline protease from Bacillus lentus with activity at pH 11, has been determined to 1.4 a resolution. The structure was solved by molecular replacement starting with the 2.1 i% structure of subtilisin BPN' followed by molecular dynamics refinement using X-PLOR. A final crystallographic R-factor of 19% overall was obtained. The enzyme possesses stability at high pH, which is a result of the high p1 of the protein. Almost all of the acidic side-chains are involved in some type of electrostatic interaction (ion pairs, calcium binding, etc.). Furthermore, three of seven tyrosine residues have potential partners for forming salt bridges. All of the potential partners are arginine with a pK around 12. Lysine would not function well in a salt bridge with tyrosine as it deprotonates at around the same pH as tyrosine ionizes. Stability at high pH is acquired in part from the p1 of the protein, but also from the formation of salt bridges (which would affect the PI). The overall structure of the enzyme is very similar to other subtilisins and shows that the subtilisin fold is more highly conserved than would be expected from the differences in amino acid sequence. The amino acid side-chains in the hydrophobic core are not conserved, though the inter-residue interactions are. Finally, one third of the serine sidechains in the protein have multiple conformations. This presents an opportunity to correlate computer simulations with observed occupancies in the crystal structure.

1. Introduction The subtilisins are a family of serine proteases that are excreted by a variety of Bacillus and fungal species. They have a molecular mass of 2'7 to 29 kDa and are active at neutral to alkaline pH. Their stability and broad specificity has led to their use as a protein-degrading additive in commercial washing detergents and world-wide production of proteases has reached tens of thousands of tons per year. The subtilisins have been widely used as model systems for studying catalysis (Wells et al., 1986; Carter & Wells, 1988; Rao et al., 1987; Takagi et al., 1989), specificity of substrate binding (Wells et al., 1987a,b; (Hwang & Betzel et al., 1988a), electrostatics Warshel, 1987; Sternberg et al., 1987; Russell &

To date, the structures of a number of subtilisins have been solved, beginning with subtilisin BPN' in 1969 (Wright et al., 1969; Drenth et al., 1972; Hirono et al., 1984; McPhalen et al., 1985b; Neidhart & Petsko, 1988; Bott et al., 1988), subtilisin Carlsberg (McPhalen et al., 1985a; Bode et al., 1987), proteinase K from Tritirachium album (Betzel et al., 1988c) and thermitase from Thermoactinomyces vulagris (Dauter et al., 1988; Teplyakov et al., 1989, 1990; Gros et al., 1989). From this work, it has been appreciated that the different structures exhibit a high degree of similarity. We recently cloned and overexpressed a bacterial alkaline protease from BaciZZus Zentus (Hansen, D., Ladin, B., Reynolds, R., Paech, C., Goddette, D., Mielenz, J. & Wilson, R. (1990).

mates, particularly with samples of low protein content, a modified Lowry procedure was employed (Larson et al., 1986). (iii) Protease a-ssays and determination of kinetic parameters Protease activity ww assayed with succinyl-L-AlaL-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide (AAPF-pNAt; Bachem) aa substrate (DelMar et al., 1979). A stock solution of 160 mM-AAPF-pNA was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide dried with a molecular sieve (4 A, 4 to 8 mesh; Aldrich) for at least 24 h prior to use. Fixed point assays were performed at 25°C with 1.6 mM-AAPF-pNA in 100 mm-Tris, adjusted to pH &6 with 2 M-HCl, in a total of 1.020 ml of solution. The substrate was added to the aasay buffer and the reaction was started by addition of enzyme 1 min later at a final concentration of 59 ng of protein/ml (%2 nna-enzyme). Release of p-nitroanilide wm monitored and a molar extinction coefficient of at 410nm, 8480 M-l cm-' was used to calculate the amount and concentration of product formed. Initial rates measured at 12 different AAPF-pNA concentrations ranging from @16 to 3.2 mM and kinetic parameters were calculated from initial velocity veraua substrate plots. Data were fitted to a hyperbolic curve and proportionally weighted using the program ENZFITTER (Biosoft, Milltown, MA). (iv) Polyac ylamide gel electrophoresis Protein purity was evaluated on 20% non-denaturing PhastSystem gels (Pharmacia) run with reversed polarity. Buffer strips were prepared as described in Pharmacia Application File no. 300. Molecular maas determinations were performed on 20% SDS PhastSystem gels, using the following markers: bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa; egg albumin, 45 kDa; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 36 kDa; carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; trypsinogen, 24 kDa; trypsin inhibitor, 201 kDa; a-lactalbumin, 142 kDa (all from Sigma). To avoid autoproteolytic byproducts, protease samples were denatured prior to SDSPAGE with formic acid (30 to 50% (v/v) final). After dilution to 15 y0 (v/v) formic acid, the protein was precipitated with trichloroaeetic acid (5% (v/v) final). The collected pellet wm washed once with water, then dissolved in 2% (w/v) SDS and heated for 2 min in a boiling waterbath.

2. Materials and Methods
(a) Puri$catkm and biochemical assays (i) Protease puri$cution Bacillus subtilis DB104 (obtained from Dr R. Doi, University of California, Davis, CA) carrying the plasmid pC5lc was grown in shake flasks as previously described (Goddette et al., 1992). Fermentation broth was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was placed, with stirring, on ice and after 15 min the pH of the solution was adjusted to 58 with glacial acetic acid. All subsequent steps were performed on ice or at 4"C, except as noted. After stirring for again another 15 min, the solution was centrifuged (20,000 g for 15 min). The dark brown solution was dialyzed (Spectrapor # 1, 6 to 8 kDa molecular-weightcut-off) for 16 h in Mes buffer (20 mM-Mes/Na+ (pH 5%), containing 1 mM-CaCl,). The dialysate was clarified by centrifugation (20,000 g for 10 min) and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.8 with 2 M-NaOH. The enzyme solution (1.2 1 at @75 mg/ml protein) was loaded at a flow-rate of 150 ml/h onto a column of S-Sepharose Fast Flow (25 mm x 260 mm; Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with Hepes buffer (20 mMHepes/Na+, 1 mM-CaCl,, pH 7%). The column was then washed with 2 column volumes of Hepes buffer and developed with a gradient of 0 to @25 m-NaCl in 600 ml of Hepes buffer at a flow-rate of 140 ml/h. The gradient eluate was collected in 5.2 ml portions into tubes containing 2 ml of 100 mM-Mes/Na+ (pH 58). This acid pH immediately after elution helps to prevent autolysis. The enzyme eluted between @12 and 0.15~-NaCl. Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled. Solid ammonium sulfate was added (@33 g/ml of solution) slowly with stirring over a period of 15 min, and the solution was incubated on ice with stirring for another 15 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in Mes buffer and the protein concentration adjusted to 5 to 7 mgJm1. Following dialysis (16 h in Mes buffer), the solution was clarified by centrifugation and the pH adjusted to 7.2. The protease was further purified by rechromatographing on the same S-Sepharose column described above. All steps were the same as described above, except that the pH of the Hepes buffer was 7.2 and that the NaCl gradient was shallower (0 to 0.25 M in 600 ml of Hepes buffer). The protein was precipitated and stored as an ammonium sulfate precipitate at - 70°C. Prior to use, the precipitate was dissolved in Mes buffer (typically) at the desired protein concentration and dialyzed overnight in the buffer of choice. (ii) Protein assays The biuret method (Gornall et al., 1948) was used for precise protein determination. For rapid protein esti-

(b) Crystallization Crystals of native subtilisin BL suitable for X-ray analysis were grown by the vapor diffusion method using method in disposable multiple well ;:tL;tiP,:P, . Science Products, Palo Alto, CA). The protein concentration was brought to 24 to 30 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Amicon YMlO) or by precipitation with acetone or ammonium sulfate followed by extensive dialysis against citrate buffer (50 mM-trisodium citrate, 2 mMCaCl,. pH 57 to 59). The concentrated enzyme was mixed with an equal volume of a polyethylene glycol solution (PEG 3350; Alltech), 13 to 16% (w/v) in citrate buffer) and passed through a 045 pm filter (Millipore Ultrafree MC). A lo-p1 portion of the filtrate was then pipetted to the middle of a siliconized glass cover-slip and placed upside down over a well containing 600 ~1 of the t Abbreviations used: AAPF-pNA, succinyl+AlaL-Ala-L-Pro-L-Phe-p-nitroanilide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s., root-mean-square.

(50 kV, 60 mA) was reflected from

chromator and passed through a @2mm pin-hole. The crystal to detector distance was 150 mm: 360 frames in o in increments of 15 s were collected for 10 min each with
20 set at 35". The crystal oscillated over 15 s in w for all

frames. The data were reduced using the XENGEN (Nicolet Instrument Co.). The software package MERLOT software (Fitzgerald, 1988) was used for
solving the rotation and translation functions, followed by molecular dynamics refinement using X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1987). Co-ordinates have been deposited (access no. lST3) in the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et

al., 1977). Molecular modelin was performed using the software package QUANTA Tl!3(Polygen MSI, Waltham,
MA).

3. Results and Discussion
Subtilisin BL purified as described above yields an electrophoretically homogeneous protein with a molecular mass of 26,823 Da. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is observed to be greater than 10 on isoelectric focusing gels (data not shown). A more accurate value is unavailable given the experimental difficulties of determining p1 values above pH 10. AAPF-pNa-supported catalysis in 61 MTris . HCl (pH 86 at 25°C) is characterized by a K, of 1*05m~ (+5%), k,,, of 308s' (f3%) and a k,,,/K, of 297 s-l mi+-' (fS%). Crystallizations were carried out as described in Materials and Methods. In two to four weeks, crystals reached a size suitable for diffraction studies (63 mm x 64 mm x 1-Omm). The crystals proved to have the symmetry of the orthorhombic space group P2,2,2, with unit cell constants a =

The data set for the native protein was obtained from three crystals to a resolution of 1.36 A and consisted of a total of 171,751 observations of 49,154 unique reflections. A summary of the data set statistics is presented in Table 1. The set is 97 y. complete from 15 to 1.45 A. The 1.45 to 1.36 A resolution shell was 69 o/o complete. The unweigh ted R-factor on F2 is 91 y. for all observables. The structure of subtilisin BL was solved by molecular replacement (Crowther, 1973; Fitzgerald, 1988). The co-ordinates of subtilisin BPN' were obtained from Dr A. Selecki and Dr M. N. G. James (BSNI in the Brookhaven Protein Database). The water and inhibitor atoms were removed from the model and the 98 non-identical amino acid residues BL glycine residues) were (except subtilisin converted to alanine. Relative to subtilisin BPN', subtilisin BL has three deletions and these residues were removed from the model. The model coordinates were transformed to the center of mass prior to calculating the rotation and translation function. The relative orientation of subtilisin BL was determined with the fast rotation function using data from 3 to 15 A. The rotation function had a single large peak at the Euler angles 6, = 0", e2 = 80", 8, = 195" with magnitude greater than 10a compared with 2a for the next highest peak. The translation function was calculated and solved using the original model rotated by the Euler angles without refining them. Subsequent R-factor minimization using RMINIM (Ward et al., 1975) led to a final solution for the rotation and translation function of 8, = 180", 8, = 76", 8, = 197.6" and TA = 0.104, TB = 9534 and T, = 6394, respectively.

Figure 1. A Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952) of the errors associated with the final structure of subtilisin BL. The overall R-factor is estimated to be about 20%. (a) Rejinement During the medium-resolution refinement of the structure (to 2.2 A), the model contained 1541 atoms. After rigid body least-squares minimization, the structure was refined using molecular dynamics annealing using X-PLOR (Briinger et al., 1987) to an R-factor of 626 at 2.2 A. Subsequently, the appropriate amino acid residues were modified to reflect the amino acid sequence of subtilisin BL where the density allowed placement of the sidechain. A few solvent molecules were added where appropriate. Conventional positional refinement proceeded including all the data out to 1.45 A with an overall R-factor of 919. Examination of highresolution electron density maps allowed unambiguous placement of all amino acid side-chains except ArglOl and Arg269 (the C terminus) for which density was patchy past the p-carbon. Otherwise, virtually all other atoms were well resolved. The final structure contained 148 water molecules with an average temperature factor of 31 A2. The orientations of the leucine and valine side-chains were easily distinguished as were the conformations of all the proline residues. The Luzzati plot (Fig. 1) shows the errors in atom coordinates to be between 61.5 to 620 A. The r.m.s. deviation of the final model from ideal geometry is

Most of the torsion angle pairs cluster in the areas expected for u-helical structures and B-strands. The torsion angles for the few non-glycine residues that fall outside these areas lie very close to the edge of the allowed /?-sheet region. The (4, @) pairs for the residues that fall in the left-handed helical region near (60", 60') are observed for residues that are found on the surface of the protein in "random coil" regions and are all well defined in the (2F,- F,) electron density map. The x1 and x2 angles of the amino acid side-chains were examined and compared with the rotamer values obtained by Ponder & Richards (1987). In the final structure, 98% of the side-chains had x1 and x2 values that could be assigned to within 20 of standard rotamers. Five side-chains had nonstandard x1 values and are listed in Table 2.

Application of this analysis to earlier models was extremely useful in identifying improperly refined side-chains. A plot of the mean temperature factor distribution as a function of residue number is presented in Figure 4. As would be expected, the highest B-factors occur in the surface loops. An outstanding feature of this plot is two large peaks that correloops from position spond to the substrate-binding 98 to 104 and 122 to 128, respectively. The same loops in the starting model (2SNI) have much lower B-factors, presumably due to the presence of an inhibitor in the crystal structure of BPN'. However, an examination of other subtilisin structures does not show a correlation between the temperature factors for the substrate-binding loops and the presence or absence of an inhibitor (1SBC and 1CSE; Neidhart & Petsko, 1988; Bode et al., 1987; 2SNI and 1SOl; McPhalen et al., 1985b; Pantoliano et al., 1989). Nevertheless, one would expect the motion of reduced in an these loops to be significantly enzyme-substrate complex. The substrate fills a number of unoccupied hydrogen bond donors and acceptors from the substrate-binding loops (Bode et al., 1986). This would also correlate with the general observation that enzymes are often stabilized by substrate. (b) Calcium-binding sites

Figure 4. The temperature factors of subtilisin BL backbone as a function of residue number. The 2 highest peaks correspond to the substrate-binding loops from residue 98 to 104 and 122 to 128. The overall mean temperature factor for the protein is 11 A2 The geometry of the low-affinity calcium-binding site is somewhat different from what has been observed previously. The co-ordinating carbonyl groups are largely conserved between subtilisin BL and other subtilisins. However, Asp191 is not directly involved in co-ordination but forms a salt bridge with Arg241 and Lys245 (described below). Interestingly, Wat273 is interposed between the metal and the carboxylate group of the aspartic acid residue. There has been some discussion in the literature as to whether this metal is a calcium ion (Bott et al., 1988; Teplyakov et al., 1989, 1990; Gros et al., 1989). To examine this question, we analyzed the geometry of the metals in the low and high-affinity binding sites and compared these values with those compiled by Chakrabarti (1990). Typical Ca'+-0 distances are distributed in the range 2.2 to 2.5 A. The Ca2+-O-C angle ranges from 140 to 170" for unidentate cases. The deviation of the metal ion from the peptide plane (the angle 19)ranges between 55 and 90" (0 is defined such that 90" is in the plane of the peptide). Finally, the angle w, which measures the C-O-M angle (where M is the Ca2+ projected into the peptide plane), ranges from 170 to 208". Larger deviations in the 8 and m angles are observed with carbonyl groups that have another carbonyl group one to three residues away that binds to the same metal ion (as is the case in subtilisin). We find, under these crystallization conditions (2 mM-Ca2 + , 50 mu-trisodium citrate, pH 5.9) that the distances and angles observed between the metal and the oxygen ligands are consistent with those observed in other proteins for ligands to a calcium ion (Table 3). (c) Charged groups and pH stability Subtilisin BL is an alkaline protease with enhanced pH stability relative to subtilisin Carl&erg (Goddette et al., 1992). This is certainly a

Subtilisin BPN' is known to have two calciumbinding sites, one of high affinity from which the calcium cannot be removed without denaturing the enzyme, and one of lower affinity. The high-affinity calcium-binding site is composed of a loop of amino acid residues from Ala72 to Leu80 and the sidechains of Gln2 and Asp40. These latter two residues form the two opposing positions of the octahedral co-ordination geometry, with the remaining four ligands from three main-chain carbonyl groups of residues Leu73, Ile77 and Va179, and the 0' of Asn75. The structure of the loop is virtually identical between subtilisin Carlsberg (ICSE) and subtilisin BL with an r.m.s. deviation of 936 A between all the comparable atoms in the calcium-binding loop.

The angles are defined by the system described by Chakrabarti (1996) where the C-O vector defines the s-axis, the y-axis is in the plane of the peptide and the z-axis is perpendicular to the plane of the peptide bond. tl is the acute angle between the Ca'+-0 vector and the z-axis, which measures the deviation of the metal from the peptide plane (90" would be in the peptide plane). m is the angle between the z-axis and the projection of the Ca* +-0 vector onto the zy plane.

reflection of its higher p1, which is calculated (using GCG program ISOELECTRIC with no modification) to be 102 as opposed to 7.1 for the Carlsberg enzyme. At pH extremes, the electrostatic free energy of the protein can be reduced by unfolding, which increases the separation of like charges and maximum stability should occur near the isoelectric point (Stigter & Dill, 1990). At neutral and slightly alkaline pH, subtilisin BL has six ion pairs involving 13 residues and the C terminus out of 27 charged groups. Only one acidic residue is not involved in some type of ionic interaction (see Table 4). Thermitase has 11 ion pairs involving 16 residues, and both the N and C termini out of 32 charged groups and subtilisin Carlsberg has three ion pairs involving six residues out of 21 charged groups (Teplyakov et al., 1990). Subtilisin BL has about the same percentage of charged groups involved in ion pairs as thermitase. The carboxylate of Asp191 is within 4 A of the low-affinity calcium, but is involved in a salt bridge with Arg241 and Lys245 rather than calcium binding. This aspartic acid residue and arginine residue are conserved in all subtilisins except proteinase K, which lacks the arginine. In subtilisin Carlsberg, BPN' and thermitase, this aspartic acid residue is in the secondary co-ordination shell of the low-affinity calcium. In subtilisin BL, however, Asp191 is clearly involved in a salt bridge with the arginine and lysine residues, and the separation between the carboxylate group and the metal ion is 5.3 A, as compared with 38 A for subtilisin BPN'. Unlike the other proteases, a water molecule sits directly between the carboxylate function of Asp191

and the metal ion. The distance between Asp191 and O*' and Wat273 is 2.42 A, which is shorter than a standard hydrogen bond. Subtilisin BL has been characterized by stability at high pH. Therefore, ionization of the tyrosine side-chain would be important with increasing pH. We examined the seven tyrosine residues in the protein for potential salt bridge partners. Three of the tyrosine residues have arginine residues in close proximity such that a salt bridge could possibly be formed (Tyr89 and Arg44; Tyrl61 and Arg164; Tyr257 and Arg 180). None of these arginine residues is involved in a salt bridge in the current structure. Two other tyrosine hydroxyl groups are in hydrogen-bonding distance of amide groups (Tyrl65 and the amide group of Serl30; Tyr208 and N"' of His38). The hydroxyl groups of the last two tyrosine residues (186 and 203) are highly solvated with crystallographic water molecules. It is interesting that all of the potential partners are arginine residues, which have a substantially higher pK than tyrosine (-12 compared with 191 for tyrosine). Lysine (pK N 195) would not make a particularly strong salt bridge with tyrosine because it begins to deprotonate around the same pH that tyrosine begins to ionize. From these observations, it seems that stability at high pH is acquired in part from the p1 of the protein but also from the formation of salt bridges. However, whether the tyrosine residues actuallv form salt bridges at high pH is perhaps irrelevani. The significant observation may be that subtilisin BL has fewer tyrosine residues (7) than its less pHstable counterparts (10 in BPN'; 13 in Carlsberg; 14 in thermitase; 15 in proteinase K) and that the remaining tyrosine residues are close to positively charged side-chains to counterbalance the potentially destabilizing ionization of the hydroxyl over

pH 10. This would suggest that pH stability can be enhanced by replacing tyrosine with another amino acid. In a comparison of several different subtilisin sequences, tyrosine is most often replaced by leucine followed closely by tryptophan, valine and isoleucine. While it is known that surface charge modulates histidine residue the pK, of the active-site (Sternberg et al., 1987), that modulation does not account for the shift of subtilisin BL pH profile to the alkaline side as compared with BPN'. Despite the large difference in theoretical pI between subtilisin BL (162) and BPN' (65), we found no significant difference between the pK, of the active site histidine residues (7.0+61; C.P. & D.W.G., unpublished results). Similar results were observed in a comparison of anionic and cationic trypsin (Soman et al., 1989). This suggests that the shift of pH optimum (on protein-supported catalysis rather than non-ionizing chromagenic peptide substrates) is a result of the change in p1 rather than an effect on the pK, of the catalytic histidine residue. (d) Comparison with SavinaseTM Subtilisin BL and SavinaseTM are both alkaline proteases from B. lentus and differ in sequence by five amino acid residues. Four of the five changes occur in the substrate-binding loop from 97 to 102 (see the legend to Fig. 5). Most notably, position 99 in subtilisin BL (101 by BPN' numbering) is arginine as compared with serine in all other subtilisin proteases. The recently published crystal structure of SavinaseTM (Betzel et al., 1992) provides for an interesting comparison between the two enzymes. The structures are, not surprisingly, very similar in a number of details. For example, both groups are reporting high B-factors in the substrate-binding loops. Three non-glycine residues that lie outside of allowed regions are identical between the two structures (Asp32, Asn75 and Va179). The distribution of salt bridges in SavinaseTM and subtilisin BL is essentially the same, although they differ in a few details. In subtilisin BL, Glu87 is sandwiched between Arg4.4 and Lys27, but does not form a salt bridge with either side-chain, although it could easily. The side-chain of the C-terminal arginine residue is completely disordered in subtilisin BL, while in Savinase TM it is shown to interact with Glu265. (e) Comparison with other subtilisin proteases

Figure 5. The amino acid sequences of subtilisin BL (BLAP), subtilisin BPN' (BPN'), subtilisin Carlsberg (CARL), TRM (TRM) and proteinase K (PRK) were
aligned based on the 3-dimensional structures of each respective protein structure. The amino acid sequence of SavinaseTM is identical with BLAP, except for the following (Savinase to BLAP, BLAP numbering): 897D, S99R, SlOlA, V1021 and G157S.

Figure 5 shows the alignment of the protein sequences from subtilisin BL (BLAP), subtilisin BPN' (BPN'), subtilisin Carlsberg (CARL), thermitase (TRM), and proteinase K (PRK) based on an alignment of the three-dimensional structures. The overall fold and position of secondary structure elements is virtually the same as in other subtilisins. The positioning of helices, p-strands, turns and other aspects of structure common to the subtilisins has been discussed in great detail elsewhere (Kraut,

1977; Bode et al., 1987; Frommel & Sander, 1989; Betzel et al., 1990) and will not be repeated here. The largest difference on a global scale between subtilisin BL and BPN' is a shift of the D and E helices that hold the ends of the substrate-binding loops in position. The axes of these parallel helices are 1.2 A closer in subtilisin BL than in BPN', though the significance of this for substrate binding or catalysis is not clear. The same 9" tilt relates the two helical axes for both BLAP and BPN'. This does not appear to be an effect of inhibitor binding to BPN' as a comparison of different BPN' structures without substrates or inhibitors reveals the same positioning of the helices. Interestingly, the r.m.s. deviation between the u-carbon backbones of BLAP and BPN' (969 A) is very close to (and in some cases less than) the r.m.s. deviations between various structures of BPN'. It is clear that both the resolution and thermal motion should be included for meaningful comparison of structures (Bott & Frane, 1990). There are three deletions of amino acid residues in BLAP relative to BPN': two deletions of a single residue and one deletion of four residues. The two single deletions cause local perturbations with little

The conformations of equivalent glutamine residues at position 57 (59 in BPN') are almost 180" opposed.

D. W. Goddette et al. subtle differences, however. For example, BLAP and BPN' are coincident from position 51 to 55. CARL deviates from BLAP and BPN' due to the alanine residue at position 51 (instead of the proline residue in BLAP and BPN'), and traverses the same region more efficiently with only three residues. However, from then on the structure of CARL most closely matches BPN' and an extra residue is used relative to BLAP. TRM also deviates at position 51 (Asp60 in TRM), which is involved in the binding of a calcium ion. Unlike the other subtilisins, this loop in TRM makes up a third calcium-binding site. An a-carbon trace of this loop for all five proteins is shown in Figure 9. The loop consists of an ascending strand from position 40 to 50 where they begin to deviate. The valine residue at position 50 is conserved among all of these proteins except proteinase K. Position 51 seems to influence the structure of the loop. Notice that the presence or absence of a proline residue at position 54 in BLAP as opposed to threonine in BPN' does not change the fold of the loop. The loop is most shortened in protinase K where four amino acid residues (60 to 63) do the job of eight in BPN' (48 to 57). The loops all converge at position 57-58 where they enter a buried a-helix which, as can be seen in Figure 9, is highly conserved in structure. The largest deletion in BLAP relative to BPN' is in the five-residue loop from 155 to 159. The equivalent loop in BPN' contains nine residues (residue 157 to 165 in BPN') and has the highest B-factors in that protein. Removing a region of such high thermal motion would be consistent with increasing the stability of a protease to autoproteolytic degradation, although we have no experimental indication of cause and effect. Experimentally, isolating any intermediates of autoproteolytic digestion has

increases to 6.1 A compared with 5.8 A in BPN' between 36 to 39. Outside of this region, the structure is remarkably unperturbed with an r.m.s. deviation of 634 A at Ile35 before the deletion and 025 A at His38 (39 in BPN'), which follows the deletion. Another deletion relative to BPN' occurs near residue 56 at the end of an external loop of eight residues. The loop is followed by a buried a-helix, which contains the catalytic His62. Again, the causes only small local changes and the deletion loop is shortened slightly relative to BPN'. The changes in (4, $) angles are distributed over three residues beginning with the $ angle of Ser55 and ending with the #J angle of Gin57 (see Fig. 7). The conformation of this loop is quite varied among the different subtilisins. This loop is followed by the buried and highly conserved helix that holds the catalytic histidine residue. The sequences through this region for five subtilisins are shown in Figure 8. Overall, BLAP, CARL and BPN' are most similar in structure through this region. There are

The secondary structure of subtilisin BL is shown in all 3 as a-helices (filled rectangles) and /I-strands (open rectangles). proven to be exceptionally difficult for the native enzyme. One observes only the intat protease or small peptides under almost all conditions (C.P., unpublished results). However, from this we might surmise that almost any cleavage is detrimental to the protein's stability. Some support for the effect of this deletion on increasing thermal stability comes from the observation that the equivalent residues have been deleted in both TRM and PRK, two highly thermostable proteases. The fold of this loop is very similar in BLAP, TRM and PRK. The chain continues into a conserved calcium-binding site (low affinity in BLAP, BPN' and TRM, high affinity in proteinase K) . Overall, the subtilisins show a high degree of three-dimensional similarity. Chothia BELesk (1986) examined the relationship between sequence similarity and structure in proteins and found that the

structural differences increase as the sequences diverge. The r.m.s. deviation in the position of the main-chain atoms was related to the fraction of mutated residues (H) by the expression A(8) = @4e"s'". The comparison was made between a common protein core that consisted of the mainchain atoms of major elements of secondary structure and additional atoms until the deviation in positions of the atoms in the last residue were greater than 3 A. A least-squares superposition of the main chain of 263 structurally equivalent amino acid residues between BLAP and BPN' gives an r.m.s. deviation of 973 A (O-70 A predicted, Chothia & Lesk, 1986). When compared with TRM, the r.m.s. deviation between 255 structurally equivalent residues (48 y. identical) is 997 A (l-04 A predicted). For proteinase K with only 38% identity, the r.m.s. deviation for 218 matches is 1.05 A (1.32 A predicted). The a-carbon deviations between BLAP and BPN', TRM and proteinase K are shown in Figure 10. The largest differences occur on the surface loops, which is also the site of the insertions and deletions. The high degree of similarity in structure among the subtilisins implies that either changes in the core of the enzyme do not significantly affect the structure, or that compensating mutations occur elsewhere to accommodate the change and preserve the three-dimensional fold. An examination of the internal packing shows that compensating mutations play a key role in preserving the three-dimensional structure. The core of BLAP is made up of a long hydrophobic helix (215 to 230) that is virtually identical in both sequence and structure among all the subtilisins. However, many of the sequence differences between subtilisins occur in the /l-sheets that surround this helix. Either compensating mutations occur in other parts of the /?-sheets or the fold of the sheets is defined by the "template" of the central helix and a large variety of mutations can be accommodated without perturbing the structure. This latter view would be supported by the work of Bowie et al. (1990), who showed that the core of 1 repressor is amazingly tolerant to apolar amino acid substitutions in a functional assay. However, a detailed examination of the packing shows that the addition or loss of methylene groups is accompanied by other mutations to allow proper packing of the hydrophobic core. For example, part of the hydrophobic core in BLAP is formed by the residues Va128, Val30 and Ile70. Va128 and Va130 are on the same side of a B-strand and both interact with Ile70. In TRM, the three equivalent residues are Ile34, Ile36 and Ala79 (a net loss of 1 methylene group). In both cases, the three residues interact with identical residues in the central helix.

Examination of the electron density map revealed that 11 serine side-chains have multiple conformations (listed in Table 5). This represents one-third of

conformations with 3 identifiable conformations: -66 (shown), 59" and a minor species at. 108". The two major species, both presumably hydrogen, bond to the carbonyl

the 32 serine residues in the enzyme. Each of the side-chains had at least two well-defined conformations, and many have a third low-occupancy poaition as suggested by small peaks in the electron density. Figure 11 shows each of these serine sidechains with density from the maps calculated with coefficients of either (2F, - F,) or (F, - F,). For comparison, five of the serine side-chains displayed have only one conformation. Alternative conformations of side-chains have been detected in a number of proteins. Smith et al. (1986) described extensive conformation heterogeneity in the highly refined structures of erambin (@945 A resolution), erabutoxin (1.4 A), myohemerythrin (1.3 8) and lamprey hemoglobin (2.0 A; Honzatko et al., 1985). In part, they concluded that conformational heterogeneity in protein crystals is widespread but that, at lower resolutions, these conformers are often masked by increased atomic thermal parameters. Other reports of heterogeneity have been limited to a few amino acid residues with discretely disordered side-chains (Baker, 1980; James et al., 1980; Phillips, 1980; Bolin et al., 1982; Shaanan, 1983; Wlodawer et al., 1984; Sprang et al., 1987; Stenkamp et al., 1990). A 1.26 A structure of ribonuclease A (Svensson et al., 1986) revealed 13 residues having discrete multiple conformations, only one of which is involved in crystal packing. One-third of these residues were lysine. In BLAP, all five lysine residues are ordered out to NC. Badger et al. (1991) reported alternative conformations of several side-chains in a 1.7 A structure of insulin. Recently, side-chains with discrete conformations were observed in a l-8 A resolution crystal structure of carbon-monoxy-/?4 hemoglobin. This structure is particularly interesting as 35 side-chains exhibit multiple conformations (6% of the 584 residues total in the asymmetric unit) in a wide variety of environments: three are involved in intersubunit interactions, four are in hydrophobic pockets, and the remainder are on the surface of the protein (Dr G. Borgstahl & Dr A. Arnone, personal communication)). The question inevitably arises as to whether these represent static or dynamic heterogeneity. This is impossible to determine directly from a single structure that is both a spatial average over many

equivalent or symmetrical. The 59" conformation would require a short hydrogen bond of 2%1 A, while in the -66" position the distance is 3% A.

crystal unit cells aa well aa a time average over the course of the data collection. The presence or absence of short contacts in a torsional angle search does not reveal whether the different conformations are in equilibrium or not. A direct determination of the conformational freedom of a residue would be most desirable. Along those lines, Smith et al. (1991) recently examined side-chain conformations using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on hen egg-white lysozyme (129 residues) in solution. They measured the x1 angle of 57 residues and found that about 16 of these (about 12% of the residues in the protein) exhibited extensive motional averaging about x1. From crystallographic data, four r&dues had been identified that exhibited discrete disorder. Three of these were examined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and found to be motionally averaged. Unfortunately, there are only a few c-s where both types of data are available. In the case of BLAP, it is most likely that the serine residues represent a time average a8 none is involved in crystal contacts and the multiple conformations represent rotation around a single torsion angle. A 1.8 A structure of a BLAP mutant exhibits similar distributions of serine conformations (data not shown). The answer will be specific to the particular environment of each side-chain, whether it is involved in salt bridgea, intersubunit interactions, or crystal packing. This structure provides an interesting system to study the dynamics and energtics of serine sidechain conformations. Our understanding of how the local environment affects conformation is far from complete. For example, Figure 12 shows the local environment of Ser269 (in the Anal 2F,- F, map) in which OY appears to interact with the backbone carbon?1 group of Asp191 in two different (VIIformations (-66" and 59") with a minor component at 168". Despite the roughly equal sampling, thr t,wo major conformers are significantly different

Crystal Structure of Subtilisin Simple inspection shows that they are not symmetric with respect to the carbonyl group and the hydrogen bond distance differs by over half an angstrom, from 3.3 to 2.6 A at -66" and 59", respectively. Also, the solvent-accessible surface of each conformer is different. We are in the process of modeling the serine residues in the protein to better correlate computer simulations with observed occupancies in the crystal structure. We are grateful to Terri Christianson, Ronda Mitchell and Kathy AhSan for excellent technical assistance.
