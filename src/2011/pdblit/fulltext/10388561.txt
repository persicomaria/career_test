Solution Structure and Thermodynamics of a Divalent Metal Ion Binding Site in an RNA Pseudoknot
Ruben L. Gonzalez Jr and Ignacio Tinoco Jr*
Department of Chemistry University of California Berkeley and Structural Biology Department, Physical Biosciences Division Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720-1460 USA Identi®cation and characterization of a metal ion binding site in an RNA pseudoknot was accomplished using cobalt (III) hexammine, Co(NH3)3, 6 as a probe for magnesium (II) hexahydrate, Mg(H2O)2, in nuclear mag6 netic resonance (NMR) structural studies. The pseudoknot causes ef®cient À1 ribosomal frameshifting in mouse mammary tumor virus. Divalent metal ions, such as Mg2, are critical for RNA structure and function; Mg2 preferentially stabilizes the pseudoknot relative to its constituent hairpins. The use of Co(NH3)3 as a substitute for Mg2 was investigated 6 by ultraviolet absorbance melting curves, NMR titrations of the imino protons, and analysis of NMR spectra in the presence of Mg2 or Co (NH3)3. The structure of the pseudoknot-Co(NH3)3 complex reveals an 6 6 ion-binding pocket formed by a short, two-nucleotide loop and the major groove of a stem. Co(NH3)3 stabilizes the sharp loop-to-stem turn and 6 reduces the electrostatic repulsion of the phosphates in three proximal strands. Hydrogen bonds are identi®ed between the Co(NH3)3 protons 6 and non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms, 2H hydroxyl groups, and nitrogen and oxygen acceptors on the bases. The binding site is signi®cantly different from that previously characterized in the major groove surface of tandem GÁ U base-pairs, but is similar to those observed in crystal structures of a fragment of the 5 S rRNA and the P5c helix of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron. Changes in chemical shifts occurred at the same pseudoknot protons on addition of Mg2 as on addition of Co(NH3)3, indicating that both ions bind at the same site. 6 Ion binding dissociation constants of approximately 0.6 mM and 5 mM (in 200 mM Na and a temperature of 15  C) were obtained for Co(NH3)3 and Mg2, respectively, from the change in chemical shift as a 6 function of metal ion concentration. An extensive array of non-sequencespeci®c hydrogen bond acceptors coupled with conserved structural elements within the binding pocket suggest a general mode of divalent metal ion stabilization of this type of frameshifter pseudoknot. These results provide new thermodynamic and structural insights into the role divalent metal ions play in stabilizing RNA tertiary structural motifs such as pseudoknots.

The capacity of RNA to perform structural and functional roles in biological processes depends upon its ability to fold into complex and compact tertiary structures. The close packing of helices and loops that is required for the formation of these structures is opposed by the presence of the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone. Positive ions non-speci®cally stabilize RNA structure (Anderson & Record, 1995) by screening the nega# 1999 Academic Press

1268 tively charged backbone. Additionally, speci®c metal ion binding sites have been identi®ed that are important in RNA structure and function (Stein & Crothers, 1976; Draper, 1985; Pan et al., 1993; Laggerbauer et al., 1994; Doudna & Doherty, 1997; Feig & Uhlenbeck, 1999). Until recently, detailed investigations of the interactions of metal ions with RNA was limited to crystallographic studies of tRNAs (Holbrook et al., 1977; Jack et al., 1977). Currently, crystal structures of hammerhead ribozymes (Scott et al., 1995; Pley et al., 1994), the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila self-splicing group I intron (Cate et al., 1996; Cate & Doudna, 1996), and a 5 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) domain (Correll et al., 1997) have revealed details of the interactions between divalent metal ions and speci®c binding sites in RNA. Some of these sites occur within elements of the secondary structure and others mediate tertiary contacts. The possibility of studying these types of interactions in solution using cobalt (III) hexammine (Co(NH3)3) as 6 an analog of fully hydrated magnesium (II) hexahydrate (Mg(H2O)2) was suggested by Cowan 6 (1993), based on similar ionic radii and covalent geometries for the two metal ion complexes, as well as evidence that Co(NH3)3 can activate some 6 Mg2-dependent enzymes (Jou & Cowan, 1991). Its use in solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural studies has been demonstrated by Robinson & Wang (1995) in DNA decamers and by Kieft & Tinoco (1997) in the P5b stem-loop from the T. thermophila group I intron. These structural studies of Co(NH3)3 binding to nucleic acid sec6 ondary structural elements prompted this study of the metal ion complex in the stabilization of RNA tertiary interactions in solution. RNA pseudoknots are a classic family of tertiary structures formed when nucleotides in the loop of a hairpin pair with nucleotides from an adjacent single-stranded region, forming a second stem and loop (Pleij et al., 1985). Pseudoknots have many different functional roles in biological systems. They occur at the 3H termini of several plant virus RNA genomes (Haenni et al., 1982; Rietveld et al., 1982; Joshi, et al., 1983; Guerrier-Takada et al., 1988; Kolk et al., 1998), in ribonuclease P RNA (James et al., 1988), within 16 S rRNA (Moazed & Noller, 1987), and most recently a pseudoknot structure has been identi®ed as a key component of a hepaÂ Â titis delta virus ribozyme (Ferre-D'Amare et al., 1998). Pseudoknots are often involved in translational control (Tang & Draper, 1989; Schimmel, 1989), and cause programmed ribosomal frameshifting in many retroviruses (Chamorro et al., 1992; ten Dam et al., 1994, 1995; Brierley et al., 1991; Chen et al., 1995; Brierley, 1995). Several studies have investigated the thermodynamics of pseudoknot formation and stabilization (Wyatt et al., 1990; Qui et al., 1996; Theimer et al., 1998; Nixon & Giedroc, 1998). The VPK pseudoknot studied here (Shen & Tinoco, 1995) causes frameshifting in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). It differs from the

wild-type MMTV pseudoknot in that four of the G ÁC base-pairs were ¯ipped to C ÁG base-pairs to disrupt G-rich tracks that led to multiple conformations in the native sequence (Figure 1(a) and (b)). The modi®ed VPK sequence has equal frameshifting ef®ciency as the wild-type MMTV sequence in two different constructs of ¯anking sequences (Chen et al., 1995). The VPK pseudoknot forms below 25  C in the presence of 200 mM Na, but small concentrations of Mg2 (10 mM) or Co (NH3)3 (5 mM) greatly stabilize it. The higher 6 charge of Mg2 or Co(NH3)3 compared to Na 6 undoubtedly contributes to the increased stability of the pseudoknot, but in addition there could be a speci®c metal ion binding site in the VPK pseudoknot. This speci®city could be driven by the ionic radii and the octahedral coordination geometry of Mg2 and Co(NH3)3, compared to the smaller 6 ionic radius and tetrahedral coordination geometry of Na. Here, we present the solution structure and a thermodynamic study of a metal ion-RNA tertiary interaction: an RNA pseudoknot, stabilized by a speci®cally bound Co(III) ion complex. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) crosspeaks between the protons of Co(NH3)3 and 15 RNA protons 6 allowed identi®cation and characterization of the binding site. Co(NH3)3 and Mg2 stabilize the 6 pseudoknot as shown by ultraviolet absorbance melting curves. NMR titration experiments demonstrated that Co(NH3)3 and Mg2 ions interact 6 with the pseudoknot structure at the same site, and provided estimates of their binding constants. We expect similar electrostatic and hydrogenbonding interactions of Co(NH3)3 and Mg(H2O)2 6 6 with the RNA, although the stability of binding is different.

Results
Thermodynamics Ultraviolet absorbance melting curves Ultraviolet (UV) absorbance melting curves for VPK RNA dialyzed into 10 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4) are shown in Figure 2. The UV melting curve in the absence of Mg2 or Co(NH3)3 (Figure 2(a)) displays two 6 major melting transitions. The ®rst transition has a melting temperature (tm) of approximately 27  C and is assigned to the melting of the pseudoknot interaction. The second transition has a tm of approximately 63  C and is attributed to the melting of the remaining hairpin. These transitions were assigned based on the UV melting curves of each of the individual hairpins (Figure 1(c) and (d)) which display one transition each with a tm of approximately 83  C and no transitions at lower temperatures. Overall, the pseudoknot melting transitions are unimolecular, as no increase in tm is observed with increasing VPK concentration over a range of 3 to 300 mM. Analysis of the derivative absorbance

melting curve in the absence of multivalent ions yielded estimates of the standard enthalpy changes (ÁHo) for the pseudoknot (PK) to hairpin (HP) transition and the hairpin (HP) to single-strand (SS) transition. As expected, due to the similarities of the two stems, the two ÁHo values are within 10 % of each other (ÁHo 3 HP % 37 kcal molÀ1 and PK ÁHo 3 SS % 41 kcal molÀ1). Titration of VPK RNA HP with Co(NH3)3 (Figure 2(b)) or Mg2 (Figure 2(c)) 6 shifts the tm of the two transitions to higher temperatures with increasing concentrations of metal ion until both transitions overlap. Completely overlapped transitions are observed at Co(NH3)3 con6 centrations of 10 mM, or Mg2 concentrations slightly higher than 50 mM. Shifts in tm of approximately 40 deg. C for the ®rst melting transition and 25 deg. C for the second melting transition are observed. Because the ÁHo of the pseudoknot to hairpin transition is within 10 % of the ÁHo of the hairpin to single-strand transition, the 15 deg. C difference between the two tm shifts demonstrates that the multivalent ions preferentially bind to the pseudoknot relative to the hairpin or single-strand. Titrations with Na (Figure 2(d)) also shift the tm of the two transitions to higher temperatures with increasing concentrations of metal ion, albeit at much higher concentrations of Na. Even doubling the Na concentration from 200 mM to 400 mM was not suf®cient to produce overlapping transitions. The VPK pseudoknot requires approximately ®vefold higher concentrations of Mg 2 than Co(NH3)3 to achieve a similar degree of stabiliz6

ation. Even with Na concentrations at least 40,000fold higher than Co(NH3)3 concentrations, the 6 same degree of pseudoknot stabilization is not attained. In the case of Na, tm shifts of 30 deg. C and 25 deg. C are observed for the ®rst and second melting transitions, respectively. The pseudoknot interaction is somewhat preferentially stabilized over the hairpin interaction, with only a 5 deg. C difference between the two shifts. These results are consistent with previous ®ndings that very high concentrations of Na are necessary in order for Na to replace the stabilizing role of divalent ions in pseudoknots (Wyatt et al., 1990). Equilibrium binding constants Imino proton resonance assignments were based on those made previously for VPK RNA in 5 mM MgCl2 (Shen & Tinoco, 1995). VPK RNA was titrated with either Co(NH3)3 or Mg2 and the 6 chemical shifts of the imino proton resonances were monitored as a function of concentration (Figure 3(a) and (b)). Chemical shift changes due to Co(NH3)3 binding are very similar to those 6 induced by Mg2 binding. This indicates similar binding modes for both metal ions. In both cases the imino protons of G15, G17, and G4 exhibit the largest down®eld shifts, whereas the imino protons of G9 and G11 undergo the largest up®eld shifts. The imino protons of G1 and G2 are shifted to a greater degree by Mg2. This is presumably due to direct coordination of Mg2 ions to the 5H -terminal

triphosphate which does not occur with Co(NH3)3 6 ions. Proton chemical shift changes can be caused by metal ion binding in the local environment of the proton, or by structural changes brought about by metal ion binding not necessarily near the proton. A H2O NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment in the presence of Co(NH3)3 identi®ed the 6 imino protons which are directly near the binding site. NOE crosspeaks from Co(NH3)3 protons to 6 the imino protons of G10, G11, and G29 were

observed, identifying these imino protons as direct probes of the metal ion binding site (Figure 4). Binding curves can be constructed by plotting the chemical shift of individual imino protons as a function of metal ion concentration. Two such curves are plotted in Figure 3(b) for the imino proton of G11 versus Co(NH3)3 and Mg2 concentrations, 6 respectively. For a system in fast exchange, the binding data for a 1:1 stoichiometry can be ®t to the following binding isotherm:

in which dobs is the observed RNA chemical shift, db is the chemical shift of the fully bound proton, df is the chemical shift of the unbound proton, [RNA]t is the total RNA concentration, [ion]t is the total ion concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium binding dissociation constant for the RNA-metal ion complex (Roberts, 1993). This binding isotherm applies to one ion binding site per RNA molecule; it can be ®t to obtain the fully bound chemical shift and the equilibrium binding dissociation constant Kd. Binding constants calculated for imino protons with signi®cant chemical shift dependence on metal ion concentration agree within three- to fourfold of those calculated for the imino proton of G11 (Figure 3(b)), consistent with a one binding site model. This method was used to obtain equilibrium dissociation constants of Kd(Co(NH3)3)  0.6(Æ6 0.4) mM and Kd(Mg2)  5(Æ3) mM, for binding to VPK in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM Na, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4), at a temperature of 15  C.

There is an approximately eightfold increase in af®nity for the Co(NH3)3 metal ion versus Mg2 metal 6 ion, presumably due to the greater positive charge of Co(NH3)3. Although it would be advantageous 6 to measure binding constants using a VPK nonexchangeable proton, no non-exchangeable proton resonance was suf®ciently well resolved in the 1D spectra. In addition to the imino protons at the Co (NH3)3 binding site, imino protons from other 6 regions of the pseudoknot display chemical shift changes. Imino protons from G17 and G4 in stem 1 exhibit down®eld chemical shifts on binding of the cobalt ion complex. The G15 imino proton, adjacent to the junction region of the pseudoknot, demonstrates the largest chemical shift change in both the Co(NH3)3 and Mg2 titrations. It is clear 6 that during these titrations considerable structural changes are occurring within the pseudoknot, particularly the junction region, which cause these

Sample conditions are 2 mM VPK, 2 mM Co(NH3)3, 10 MM sodium phos6 phate, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4), at a temperature of 20  C.

200 mM Na, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4), and a temperature of 10  C was Kd  0.19(Æ0.01) mM (Kieft, 1997). Subsequent equilibrium dialysis experiments were done on P5b to validate the binding constants using imino proton chemical shift changes observed during metal ion titrations. The results of the equilibrium dialysis experiments are consistent with one metal ion binding at one strong binding site (Kd  0.72(Æ0.06) mM) and approximately two ions binding at weaker binding sites (Kd  0.06(Æ0.04) mM2). The equilibrium dialysis Kd of the one strong binding site is about fourfold weaker binding than that calculated from the imino titrations. The Kd obtained from the imino proton titrations is expected to be smaller (stronger binding) than the value obtained from equilibrium dialysis due to assumptions about non-speci®c binding used in the analysis of the imino proton titration data. Non-speci®c binding leads to a decrease in the concentration of free Co(NH3)3; in 6 the equilibrium dialysis experiments, the free concentration of Co(NH3)3 is determined directly, and 6 the effect of non-speci®c binding is included. Nevertheless, using imino proton chemical shift changes during metal ion titrations provides equilibrium binding constants for strong binding sites that are in reasonable agreement with those measured from equilibrium dialysis experiments. Comparison of spectra in Mg2 and in Co(NH3)3 6 NOESY spectra were acquired in H2O and 2H2O for VPK in the presence of Mg2 and in the presence of Co(NH3)3. In both cases the same NOE 6 connectivities and relative intensities are observed. The most notable changes occur in the chemical shifts of the RNA protons. It was observed that for VPK in the presence of Mg2 the optimum temperature for experiments involving exchangeable protons was 15  C, and for experiments involving non-exchangeable protons it was 30  C. At these temperatures the VPK-Co(NH3)3 complex dis6 played very broad lines and a number of NOE crosspeaks were not observed due to the line broadening. The VPK-Co(NH3)3 complex dis6 played optimal spectral qualities at temperatures of 20  C for exchangeable protons, and 35  C for non-exchangeable protons. This is probably due to greater stabilization of VPK by 2 mM Co(NH3)3 6 as compared to 5 mM Mg2. As indicated by the UV absorbance melting curves, about ®vefold higher concentrations of Mg2 are necessary to provide the same amount of stabilization as 2 mM Co(NH3)3. Unfortunately, such large concen6 trations of Mg2 generally tend to broaden spectral lines. The greater stabilization by Co(NH3)3 6 allows for work at higher temperatures and provides sharper lines. Aggregation due to Mg2 ions interacting with 5H triphosphate groups on multiple VPK molecules may also cause broader lines in the Mg2 spectra. This type of aggregation would not be present in the Co(NH3)3 spectra. 6

chemical shift changes. Thus, unlike the P5b stem loop (Kieft & Tinoco, 1997), the pseudoknot structure changes upon divalent metal ion binding. Even small changes in the relative position of the G15 imino with respect to A6, A14, and/or A27 nucleotides at the junction may cause notable chemical shift changes due to the large ring currents associated with the adenine bases. Spectra acquired in 200 mM Na but in the absence of Mg2 or Co(NH3)3 exhibit very broad, low inten6 sity or absent NOE crosspeaks in the junction region. This may be due to low pseudoknot stability in the absence of Mg2 or Co(NH3)3 at higher 6 temperatures, and/or broadening due to large rotational correlation times associated with lower temperatures. These broad or absent NOE crosspeaks, coupled with signi®cant spectral overlap in the one dimensional spectra made it dif®cult to measure chemical shift changes for non-exchangeable protons in the junction region. Similar binding studies were done and equilibrium binding dissociation constants were obtained for the Co(NH3)3 binding site formed by tandem 6 G ÁU base-pairs in the P5b stem loop from the T. thermophila group I intron (Kieft & Tinoco, 1997). The dissociation constant determined from imino proton titrations in 10 mM sodium phosphate,

1273 stems of the pseudoknot in the presence of either metal ion complex. The relative intensities of these crosspeaks are the same in both cases. In some regions of the spectra, better dispersion is obtained in the presence of Co(NH3)3. In addition, connec6 tivities observed through the pseudoknot loops in the presence of Mg2 are also seen in the presence of Co(NH3)3 (Figure 5(a) and (b)). As noted 6 above, signi®cant structural changes do occur upon metal binding in VPK, particularly in the junction region. The comparison of spectra in Mg2 and in Co(NH3)3 demonstrates that these changes 6 occur in the presence of either metal ion complex, and that there is not much structural difference between the structure in the presence of Mg2 or the presence of Co(NH3)3. Assignments for non6 exchangeable protons in the presence of Mg2 at 30  C and Co(NH3)3 at 35  C are provided in the 6 Supplementary Material. Intermolecular NOE crosspeak assignment NOESY experiments in H2O were used to detect intermolecular NOE crosspeaks between the Co

Analysis of exchangeable proton resonances Spectra recorded in H2O displayed the same number of imino proton resonances for VPK in the presence of Mg2 as in the presence of Co(NH3)3. 6 The same imino to imino NOE crosspeaks were observed in both complexes. There were no changes in the base-pairing scheme upon addition of Co(NH3)3 as has been observed in the NMR 6 structure of a fragment of 16 S rRNA that binds to ribosomal protein S8 (Kalurachchi & Nikonowicz, 1998). In addition, the same imino to amino, imino to H5 and imino to H1H NOE crosspeak connectivities were observed for VPK in the presence of either Mg2 or Co(NH3)3. Assignments for 6 exchangeable protons in the presence of Mg2 at 15  C and Co(NH3)3 at 20  C are provided in the 6 Supplementary Material. Analysis of non-exchangeable proton resonances The sugar H1H to base aromatic H6/H8 NOE crosspeak connectivities that are typical of A-form helical structure can be followed through both

Sample conditions in (a) are 2 mM VPK, 5 mM Mg2, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4) at a temperature of 30  C. Sample conditions in (b), (c) and (d) are identical, with the exception of 2 mM Co(NH3)3 6 instead of 5 mM Mg2, and a temperature of 35  C.

1274 (NH3)3 protons and the RNA protons. A total of 6 15 positive crosspeaks (same sign as diagonal peaks) were detected with varying intensities and line widths. Crosspeaks from the Co(NH3)3 pro6 tons to the G10, G11, and G29 imino (Figure 4) and C12, C30, and C31 amino (Figure 5(c)) protons were assigned from the H2O NOESY data. Intermolecular NOE crosspeaks to aromatic RNA protons were more dif®cult to assign due to resonance overlap. The H2O NOESY experiments at different concentrations of Co(NH3)3 were used 6 to determine which crosspeaks appeared ®rst and with what intensity. Titration with Co(NH3)3 6 gave rise to a set of peaks whose intensities increased with increasing concentrations of Co(NH3)3; these peaks were assigned to a strong ion 6 binding site. At higher concentrations of ligand, crosspeaks due to non-speci®c Co(NH3)3 binding 6 began to be observed. These results are consistent with one relatively strong binding site. The 2H2O NOESY experiments at 20  C and 35  C provided chemical shift assignments for aromatic RNA protons at the two different temperatures. These were then compared with H2O NOESY experiments recorded at the same temperatures. From these experiments it was possible to provide assignments for all but one of the intermolecular NOE crosspeaks. NOE crosspeaks were detected between the Co(NH3)3 protons and the 6 G1H8, G7H8, G10H8, G11H8, G28H8 and C30H6 (Figure 5(c)). The G1H8 is attributed to binding at the 5H -terminal triphosphate; addition of small amounts of Mg2 to the Co(NH3)3-VPK complex 6 diminished the intensity of this crosspeak signi®cantly without altering the intensity of the other peaks. The unassigned peak was the strongest intermolecular NOE crosspeak observed and, due to overlap of the A6H8 and the G9H8 resonances, could not be unambiguously assigned from the H2O NOESY data of the unlabeled pseudoknot. This intermolecular crosspeak was unambiguously assigned as the A6H8 using an RNA sample speci®cally 13C-labeled at the adenine C8 and uracil C6 position. An HSQC-NOESY experiment done in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O was used to detect NOE crosspeaks from adenine H8 and uracil H6 protons. In the intermolecular Co(NH3)3 proton to 6 RNA aromatic proton region of this spectrum, only one crosspeak was observed and that was to the A6H8 (Figure 5(d)). The fact that no intermolecular crosspeaks to adenosine nucleotides at or near the junction are observed is consistent with no Co (NH3)3 binding in this region of the pseudoknot. 6 Also, no intermolecular crosspeaks are observed to any of the ®ve adenine H8 s in loop 2 of the pseudoknot, again consistent with no Co(NH3)3 bind6 ing in this region of the pseudoknot. Structure calculations A total of 100 starting structures were generated with randomized backbone torsion angles and randomized position of Co(NH3)3. These initial struc6

tures were then subjected to the global fold protocol as described in Materials and Methods. Of the 100 starting structures, 30 structures converged with low NOE energies and total energies. These converged structures were then subjected to further re®nement and energy minimization (see Materials and Methods). After re®nement and energy minimization, 26 of the 30 structures were judged as acceptable structures based on low NOE energies and total energies, as well as lack of NOE Ê violations greater than 0.2 A. These 26 structures were used to determine the structure statistics shown in Table 1.

Discussion
VPK pseudoknot structure The structure of the VPK pseudoknot in the presence of Co(NH3)3 does not vary signi®cantly 6 from the structure determined in Mg2 (Shen & Tinoco, 1995), although there are slight differences. Due to a number of new intramolecular RNA NOE crosspeaks, the intermolecular Co(NH3)3 proton 6 to RNA proton NOE crosspeaks, and a larger initial set of starting structures, the structure of the pseudoknot is now better de®ned. Stem 1 and stem 2 are fairly well de®ned in the 26 converged structures, with RMS deviations from the average Ê Ê structure of 0.81 A and 1.09 A, respectively. Intermolecular NOE crosspeaks from Co(NH3)3 6 protons to RNA protons have bridged the gap between the short, two-nucleotide loop 1 and the major groove of stem 2, providing indirect loop-tostem constraints; information that was previously unavailable. This has allowed better de®nition of loop 1, although the A6 and G7 bases in loop 1 can point out into solution or in towards stem 2, and

1275 were analyzed in order to identify protons within Ê Ê 3 A and within 5 A of loop 2 nucleotide protons. For each structure, roughly ten unique NOE crosspeaks are predicted involving loop 2 to stem 1 or loop 2 to loop 2 nucleotides that are not observed. The absence of these NOE crosspeaks could be caused by rapid internal motion of loop 2, leading to smaller local correlation times for these protons. Taken together, these data are consistent with a dynamic loop 2. Co(NH3)3 binding site 6 The Co(NH3)3 ion binds in a pocket consisting 6 of loop 1 and stem 2 residues (Figure 7). The short, two-nucleotide loop 1 must cross the major groove of the six base-pair stem 2, causing a sharp loopto-stem turn and bringing the loop into close contact with the stem. This close contact is particularly unfavorable because of the repulsion of negatively charged phosphates on the three strands. The Co(NH3)3 ion shields the electrostatic repulsion, 6 and mediates this close interaction between the loop 1 and stem 2 by forming hydrogen bonds to the nitrogen and oxygen acceptors that are available on the surface of this binding pocket. The Co(NH3)3 ion is in the fast exchange regime 6 within the binding pocket as well as in fast exchange between the bound and free forms as evidenced by a single average resonance frequency for all 18 Co(NH3)3 protons. The structure calcu6

still satisfy the NOE data available. The larger loop 2 is much more dif®cult to place with respect to stem 1. One critical, previously unassigned, NOE crosspeak was detected between the A27 H1H in loop 2 and the G17 H1H in stem 1. This crosspeak is observed in the presence of Mg2 or Co(NH3)3. 6 Although it is clear that loop 2 crosses the minor groove of stem 1, it is not clear exactly how it does so. As can be seen in Figure 6 and Table 1, the two stems and loop 1 of the VPK pseudoknot superimpose relatively well, with an RMSD to the average Ê structure of 2.42 A. Loop 2, however, is not well de®ned and seems to adopt a number of possible conformations. Although this is mainly due to the lack of NOE and torsion angle constraints, there is evidence to support a dynamic loop 2. In DQFCOSY experiments, H5-H6 crosspeaks for loop residues C21, U22, and C23 are of higher intensity than H5-H6 crosspeaks for residues in the stem regions. Because the H5-H6 scalar coupling is constant, the observed difference in intensities indicate fast internal dynamics relative to the stem regions. Although this does not rule out the existence of alternate relaxation pathways, which may lead to broadening of the stem H5-H6 crosspeaks and thus lower intensity peaks, additional NMR evidence support a dynamic loop 2. The adenine H2 resonances are usually the sharpest peaks in the NMR spectra of RNA due to favorable relaxation properties, yet the H2 resonances of A26 and A27 in loop 2 are not detected. Furthermore, the structures

Loop 2 is observed to adopt a number of possible conformations as it crosses the minor groove of stem 1. There are, however, two general geometries adopted by loop 2 as it enters the junction region, allowing for the de®nition of two general families of structures. Loops and the junction A14 nucleotide are shown in magenta and stems in cyan. The RMS deviation from the Ê average structure is 2.42 A.

lation protocol produced a family of structures having different positions and orientations of the Co(NH3)3. Each of the 26 ®nal structures was ana6 lyzed for hydrogen-bonding interactions (Figure 8). Hydrogen bonds were de®ned as bond lengths between the proton on the donor atom and the Ê acceptor atom shorter than 2.5 A with a bond angle of 180(Æ60) . Hydrogen bonds were found from the Co(NH3)3 protons to the pro-Sp oxygen 6 atom of A6, G7, U8, G9, G10, G29, the pro-Rp oxygen atom of C5, A6, G7, U8, and the 2H hydroxyl of C5, A6, G7, G28. Hydrogen bonds from Co(NH3)3 6 protons to the bases were observed to the N7 of A6, G7, G9, G10, G11, G28 and G29 and the O6 of G7, G10, G11, G28 and G29, as well as the N3 of A6 and G7. All of these hydrogen bond acceptors line the pocket formed by the sharp turn of loop 1 into stem 2, and are the major determinants of the stabilization of this turn by the metal ion. The rapid tumbling of Co(NH3)3 within the binding 6 pocket allows it to interact with any of these hydrogen bond acceptors. Comparison with other metal ion binding sites General trends that have been recently observed in divalent metal ion binding to RNA are also observed in the VPK pseudoknot. The Co(NH3)3 6 ion binds in a somewhat distorted major groove and interacts with non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms and purine bases, especially the O6 and N7 of guanine residues (Correl et al., 1997; Cate &

Doudna, 1996; Pan et al., 1993; Scott et al., 1995; Pley et al., 1994). The divalent ion binding site reported here, however, is substantially different from the site that has been identi®ed in tandem G ÁU base-pairs in the P5b (Cate & Doudna, 1996; Kieft & Tinoco, 1997), P5 (Cate & Doudna, 1996; Colmenarejo & Tinoco, 1999), and P1 (Allain & Varani, 1995) helices of the T. thermophila group I intron. In this type of site the divalent ion binds in the major groove to tandem GÁU base-pairs by hydrogen bonding to the O6 and N7 of the guanine bases. The uracil carbonyl group increases the electronegativity of the surface of the major groove and provides a concave surface for metal ion binding. The ion does not interact with the ribose phosphate backbone. Substituting the GÁ U pairs with G ÁC base-pairs diminishes binding to Co(NH3)3, 6 presumably due to the disruption of the electronegative surface and greater steric hindrance upon the replacement of the U carbonyl with the C amino group (Kieft & Tinoco, 1997). The binding of Co(NH3)3 to the VPK pseudo6 knot more closely resembles the binding site seen in the P5c region of the group I intron (Cate & Doudna, 1996) and the binding sites of the ®ve metal ions seen in the recently solved crystal structure of a 5 S rRNA domain (Correll et al., 1997). In these binding sites the metal ion complex simultaneously interacts with non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms and base functional groups. Both direct coordination and outer sphere coordination of the metal ion are observed in these binding

Loop 1 and the junction A14 nucleo6 tide are shown in magenta, stem 2 in cyan, Co(NH3)3 in red, hydrogen bond acceptor atoms are shown as white 6 balls, and hydrogen bonds are green. Hydrogen bonds are seen from Co(NH3)3 to the (a) A6 pro-Rp oxygen atom, 6 (b) C5 2H hydroxyl group, (c) G29 pro-Sp oxygen atom, (d) G28 2H hydroxyl group, (e) G29 N7, (f) G7 O6, (g) G7 N7, and (h) A6 N7. Similar analysis for other members of the structural family, reveals slightly different hydrogen-bonding patterns.

sites. The metal in Co(NH3)3 cannot directly coor6 dinate to RNA groups, and therefore serves as a probe of sites that do not involve direct coordination. In the case of the Co(NH3)3 binding to the 6 VPK pseudoknot, the placement of loop 1 in the major groove of stem 2, as well as the perturbation of stem 2 to accommodate this short loop, creates a unique pocket where the interactions between Co(NH3)3 and the loop 1 phosphate, 2H hydroxyl, 6 and base functional groups makes up for the generally unfavorable binding to the GÁC base-pairs in the major groove. The substitution of GÁU for G ÁC base-pairs in stem 2 should create a higher af®nity binding site. Comparison with metal binding predictions Calculation of the electrostatic surface of the VPK pseudoknot reveals the pocket formed by loop 1 and stem 2 to be among the most electrostatically negative regions of the pseudoknot. Hermann & Westhoff (1998), have demonstrated the use of Brownian dynamics simulations to pre-

dict metal-ion binding sites within RNA folds determined by NMR, including the VPK pseudoknot. This approach simulates the trajectories of positively charged spheres subject to the effect of both random Brownian movement and the electrostatic ®eld of the RNA molecule in order to identify metal-ion binding pockets. The application of this simulation to the VPK pseudoknot predicted three metal-ion binding sites (Hermann & Westhoff, 1998). The ®rst metal ion is predicted to bind to G4 and C5 in stem 1 and A25 and A26 in loop 2, the second is predicted to bind to A6 and G7 in loop 1, and the third to G7 in loop 1 and G9 and G10 in stem 2. The last two predicted sites probably correspond to the single Co(NH3)3 site ident6 i®ed by NMR. The Co(NH3)3 binding site can in 6 fact contact all the residues in these two predicted sites simultaneously. There is no NMR evidence that a Co(NH3)3 binding site exists at the pre6 dicted binding site of G4 and C5 in stem 1 and A25 and A26 in loop 2. It is important to note that the Brownian dynamics simulation was applied to the previously published VPK structure (Shen &

1278 Tinoco, 1995). We ®nd that the position of loop residues vary considerably within the family of structures compatible with the NMR data. Repeating the simulation with other low energy members of the structural family would show whether predicted metal-ion sites involving loops are in¯uenced by the choice of structure within a family. Metal ions in frameshifting pseudoknots Numerous mutational studies have been done to deduce the structural properties of frameshifting pseudoknots that are important for function (Chamorro et al., 1992; Brierley et al., 1991; Brierley, 1995; ten Dam et al., 1994). Three solution NMR structures (Shen & Tinoco, 1995; Kang & Tinoco, 1997; Du et al., 1997) and one X-ray crystal structure (Su et al., 1999) of frameshifting pseudoknots, as well as an NMR structure of one non-frameshifting mutant (Kang et al., 1996) have been obtained in an attempt to deduce a frameshifting mechanism. It has been dif®cult to identify conserved structural features among different frameshifting sequences that provide insight into the frameshifting mechanism. Precise maintenance of frameshift levels (Dinman & Wickner, 1992), as well as variation in frameshifting levels among different viruses, suggests that viruses may use modi®cation of the pseudoknot frameshifting signal to ®ne tune the level of frameshifting required by each virus (ten Dam et al., 1995). If this is true, then the general requirement of a pseudoknot as a frameshift signal may be conserved, while special features in each pseudoknot regulate the level of frameshifting. Nevertheless, several structural features are conserved. One of the highly conserved structural features of pseudoknots involved in high ef®ciency retroviral À1 frameshifting is a very short loop 1 crossing the major groove of stem 2. The length of loop 1 is generally one or two residues and stem 2 is generally ®ve to seven base-pairs (Brierley, 1995). A sharp turn at the junction of loop 1 and stem 2 is therefore required with close packing between loop 1 residues and the major groove of stem 2. This turn can be stabilized by an RNARNA interaction such as a loop residue to stem residue hydrogen bond, or through the involvement of a metal ion, both of which may be direct or water mediated. In the case of the VPK pseudoknot this turn is stabilized by a divalent metal ion. The only other frameshifter pseudoknot structure that demonstrates detailed interactions of metal ions is the X-ray crystal structure of the pseudoknot from beet western yellow virus (BWYV; Su et al., 1999). In the BWYV pseudoknot, this sharp turn from loop 1 into stem 2 is mediated by a hydrogen bond between a loop phosphate oxygen atom (corresponding to the A6 nonbridging phosphate oxygen atom in VPK) and the N4 of a cytosine in the 3H closing base-pair of stem 2 (corresponding to the U8 in VPK). The turn is stabilized by an organized network of water molecules which hydrogen bond to non-bridging phos-

Divalent Metal Binding in an RNA Pseudoknot

phate oxygen atoms throughout the turn. It is not clear that stabilization of this turn in BWYV is a general feature of frameshifter pseudoknots, since the sequence of loop 1 can vary from one virus to another and the identity of the ®rst base-pair of stem 2 also varies. Also, the structure of the BWYV pseudoknot does not reveal the role of Mg2 in stabilization of the pseudoknot structure, since Mg2 is observed to bind at the 5H -terminal triphosphate group, where it does not mediate any pseudoknot-speci®c interactions. Su and co-workers rationalize that the large concentration of Na (relative to Mg2) present in their crystallization buffer leads to stabilization of the pseudoknot structure by Na, rather than Mg2. In the BWYV pseudoknot, a Na is seen to bind in the minor groove of stem 1, interacting with bases in stem 1 and loop 2. It is rather unlikely that this Na ion is exactly mimicking the role of a divalent ion considering that the Na has a tetrahedral coordination geometry while the Mg2 coordination geometry is octahedral. Furthermore, divalent metal ions have not been shown to generally bind in the minor groove of RNA and in this case would probably interfere with the minor groove triplex that is formed between loop 2 and stem 1 (Su et al., 1999). The stabilization of the loop 1 to stem 2 turn and of the close proximity of loop 1 and stem 2 by a divalent metal ion may be a more general feature of this type of frameshifter pseudoknot regardless of sequence, as is evident from the extensive nonsequence-speci®c interactions to the phosphate oxygen atoms and 2H -hydroxyl groups of the backbone throughout the turn. Interactions with the base functional groups in stem 2, particularly the O6 and N7 of guanine bases will, for the most part, be conserved due to high G ÁC content of stem 2 in frameshifting pseudoknots. In fact, G ÁU base-pairs may form a higher af®nity binding site by replacing the C amino group with a U carbonyl group. Furthermore substitution of GÁ C base-pairs with A ÁU base-pairs will provide a major groove surface very similar to the surface formed by G ÁC base-pairs. In this case the G carbonyl group has been replaced by the A amino, but the C amino has been replaced by the U carbonyl group.

Conclusion
Using Co(NH3)3 as a probe for Mg2, this study 6 describes the detailed interaction of a divalent metal ion with an RNA pseudoknot in solution. The structure is generally well de®ned, although internal dynamics in loop 2 do not allow the precise positioning of loop 2 relative to the other regions of the pseudoknot. The metal ion binding pocket formed by loop 1 residues and the major groove of stem 2 provides a surface lined with phosphate oxygen atoms, 2H hydroxyl groups, and hydrogen bond acceptors in the bases. Binding of the metal ion stabilizes the sharp turn of loop 1

RNA oligonucleotides were puri®ed and dialyzed as described above. UV absorbance melting curves UV absorbance melting curves were recorded on a Gilford 250 spectrophotometer connected to a PC. Heating was controled by a Gilford 2527 Thermo-programmer also connected to the PC. RNA sample concentrations for melting experiments were 4 mM. Samples were heated to 70  C for 30 seconds and then cooled to 0  C for two minutes prior to data acquisition. Four samples were heated simultaneously at a heating rate of 0.5 deg. C per minute. The data were subsequently processed using Kaleidagraph software. Data were smoothed over a 5 deg. C window and absorbance was plotted against temperature. Melting temperatures were determined from the maximum values of the derivative of absorbance with respect to temperature. Standard enthalpy changes were estimated from the full widths at half height of the derivative curves. Equilibrium dialysis The large amount of RNA needed for equilibrium dialysis experiments prevented us from studying the pseudoknot. Instead we used the P5b hairpin RNA studied by Kieft & Tinoco (1997) as a model molecule. P5b RNA in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM Na, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4) was placed into one half-cell, and Co(NH3)3 in the same buffer was placed into the other 6 half-cell. Equilibrium dialysis experiments were performed in 150 ml half-cells separated by a 2000 molecular mass cut off dialysis membrane. The samples were allowed to equilibrate at 4  C for 24 hours. This equilibration temperature and time were determined by monitoring Co(NH3)3 concentration as it diffused across the 6 membrane in the absence of any RNA. Free Co(NH3)3 6 concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy to measure the concentration of cobalt in the half-cell without RNA. Bound Co(NH3)3 concentration was determined using ICP spec6 troscopy to determine the concentration of cobalt in the half-cell containing RNA and subtracting the free cobalt concentration. Equilibrium dissociation binding constants were determined by Scatchard analysis of the data. NMR spectroscopy Sample concentrations for NMR experiments, determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm, were approximately 2 mM with the exception of one dimensional (1D) titration experiments where the RNA concentrations were typically 400 mM. Samples containing Mg2 were prepared by directly adding 1 M MgCl2 to the dialyzed sample to a ®nal Mg2 concentration of 5 mM. This Mg2 concentration has been previously determined to be suf®cient for pseudoknot stabilization (Shen & Tinoco, 1995). Samples containing Co(NH3)3 were pre6 pared by directly adding 0.5 M Co(NH3)3 to the dia6 3 lyzed sample to a ®nal Co(NH3)6 concentration which was equimolar to the RNA concentration. Samples were titrated with 1 M MgCl2 or 0.5 M Co(NH3)3 to achieve 6 the desired concentrations. Samples for exchangeable proton experiments were lyophilized to dryness and redissolved in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O. Samples used for non-exchangeable proton experiments were lyophilized to dryness, lyophilized twice from 99.96 % 2H2O, and

into stem 2 and the close proximity between loop 1 and the major groove of stem 2. Although the binding is weak (Kd  5(Æ3) mM), binding of Mg2 to VPK is likely to be biologically signi®cant due to the high intracellular concentration of Mg2 (30 mM) (Cowan, 1995) and the absence of signi®cant concentrations of other multivalent ions (Feig & Uhlenbeck, 1999). A one to two nucleotide loop 1, ®ve to seven base-pair stem 2, and the availability of numerous non-sequence-speci®c hydrogen bond acceptors, all conserved features of this type of frameshifter pseudoknot, de®ne the site of Mg2 in stabilization of the pseudoknot and suggests that this is a general feature of this type of frameshifter pseudoknot. It is becoming increasingly clear that in order to understand RNA folding, we will have to learn the ``rules'' by which metal ions bind to RNA and facilitate the formation of compact and complex three-dimensional structures that are essential for function. In the VPK pseudoknot, a divalent metal ion brings together a single-stranded region of the RNA molecule with a helical region, and stabilizes a sharp turn in the molecule. Electrostatic attraction to the phosphates plus water-mediated hydrogen bonds to acceptors on the backbone and the bases provide the binding energy. Because pseudoknots, sharp turns, and close packing of helices and single-stranded regions are general features of RNA structures, we expect that metal ion stabilization of this type of tertiary interaction will be a common feature of RNA folds.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation RNA oligonucleotides were transcribed in vitro using phage T7 RNA polymerase and synthetic DNA templates (Milligan et al., 1987; Wyatt et al., 1991). RNA from transcription reactions was puri®ed by denaturing 20 % (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, removed from gel slices by electro-elution (Simon & Schuster), and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. RNA pellets were dissolved in a 5 mM EDTA solution and then dialyzed in two steps. The ®rst step consisted of dialysis at 4  C against 5 mM EDTA to chelate any divalent cations. In the second step, RNA samples were extensively dialyzed at 4  C against a buffer solution consisting of 10 mM sodium phosphate, 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM EDTA (pH 6.4). Cobalt (III) hexammine chloride was purchased from Sigma. Stock solution concentrations of cobalt (III) hexammine were determined by mass and veri®ed by absorbance at 470 nm (e  56(Æ1) MÀ1cmÀ1) (Kieft, 1997). Selective

C-labeling of RNA

Selectively 13C-labeled nucleoside triphosphates were chemically synthesized and enzymatically phosphorylated as described (SantaLucia et al., 1995). RNA oligonucleotides selectively 13C-labeled at adenine C8 and uracil C6 were in vitro transcribed using 13C8-labeled ATP and 13C6-labeled UTP and unlabeled GTP and CTP as described (Shen & Tinoco, 1995).

then dissolved in 99.96 % 2H2O. Trace amounts of TSP (3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-d4) were added to all samples as a chemical shift reference standard. All NMR spectra were processed using FELIX 95.0 (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). Exchangeable proton 1D spectra were recorded on a GE GN-500 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker HX probe. Solvent suppression was achieved by the jumpreturn method with the excitation maximum set between the imino and amino/aromatic resonances Â (Plateau & Gueron, 1982). A spectral width of 10,000 Hz was used to collect 4096 complex data points with a relaxation delay of two seconds. Two-dimensional spectra were collected on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker triple resonance triple-axis gradient probe or a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with a Nalorac triple resonance z-axis gradient probe. Unless otherwise stated, 400512 blocks of 32-80 scans consisting of 2048-4096 complex points were collected over a spectral width of 10,000 Hz (DRX-500) in H2O, or over spectral widths of 4000 Hz (DRX-500) or 5000 Hz (AMX-600) in 2H2O. The relaxation delay was set to two seconds for all experiments. NOESY experiments in H2O were recorded at 150 ms, 300 ms, and 400 ms mixing times at temperatures of 15 and 30  C in Mg2 and 20  C and 35  C in Co(NH3)3. Solvent suppression was accomplished by 6 replacing the last pulse in the NOESY sequence with a jump-return sequence and applying a z-gradient pulse during the mixing time. NOESY experiments in 2 H2O were recorded using a presaturation pulse for suppression of the residual HDO peak. Zero and double quantum artifacts at short mixing times were suppressed by applying a z-gradient pulse during the mixing time and incrementing the mixing time from one block to the next for a total of 5 ms incrementation over the full experiment time. The 2H2O NOESY spectra was acquired at 60 ms, 150 ms, 300 ms, and 400 ms mixing times at temperatures of 15 and 30  C for Mg2 and 20  C and 35  C for Co(NH3)3. 6 DQF-COSY experiments were recorded using a presaturation pulse for suppression of the residual HDO peak. The 13C-resolved HSQC-NOESY experiment was done in 90 % H2O/10 % 2H2O. The pulse sequence of Majumdar & Zuiderweg (1993) was used to provide water suppression via pulsed ®eld gradients without introducing an unfavorable excitation pro®le. Structural constraints Distance constraints were used to maintain hydrogen bonds for base-pairs which clearly formed as seen in the H2O NOESY experiments. Four distance constraints were used for the G Á C base-pairs, three for the AÁ U base-pairs, and ®ve for the G ÁU base-pairs. The hydroÊ gen bond range was set to Æ0.1 A. All observed imino to imino NOE crosspeaks were from G iminos in G Á C baseÊ pairs, and were assigned a distance range of 3.2 to 4.5 A. Intra- and intermolecular NOE crosspeaks for nonexchangeable protons were classi®ed into distance range categories based on their intensities in 60 ms, 150 ms, and 300 ms mixing time NOESY experiments in 2H2O. Co(NH3)3 protons were treated as non-exchangeable, 6 since they do not exchange on the time-scale of one block of scans (Anderson et al., 1943). NOE crosspeaks to the Co(NH3)3 were referenced to a pseudo-atom at the 6 position of the cobalt atom, with appropriate distance

Divalent Metal Binding in an RNA Pseudoknot corrections. NOE crosspeaks were classi®ed as strong Ê Ê Ê (1.8-3.2 A), medium (2.0-4.0 A), weak (2.5-5.0 A), and Ê very weak (3.0-6.0 A). Crosspeaks which could arise from a spin diffusion pathway were put into a distance Ê range of 2.0-5.0 A. Ribose sugar conformations, or d torsion angles, were determined based on H1H -H2H scalar couplings observed in DQF-COSY experiments. Backbone torsion angles (a, b, g, e, and z) were constrained to standard A-form (Saenger, 1984) in the helical stems of the pseudoknot based on observed scalar couplings and NOE connectivities that indicated A-form structure. The backbone torsion angles of the opening and closing base-pairs of stem 2, closing base-pair of stem 1, and all loop nucleotides were not constrained. Structure calculations The molecular dynamics program X-PLOR was used È to do the structure calculations (Brunger, 1993). The Co(NH3)3 complex ion was built using the Builder 6 module within the INSIGHT II suite of programs (Biosym Technologies, Inc.). Partial charges and LennardJones potentials for the Co(NH3)3 ion were taken from 6 the ESFF force®eld values. The structure of the Co (NH3)3 ion prepared in this manner is in good agree6 ment with the published crystal structure (Kruger & Reynhardt, 1978). A total of 100 starting structures were generated with randomized backbone torsion angles a, b, g, d, e, and z, and randomized positioning of the Co(NH3)3 complex ion. The structure calculation was 6 performed in three stages. The global fold protocol consisted of terms including bond lengths, bond angles, improper angles, and the NMR-derived distance and torsion angle constraints. The bond angle and bond length Ê force constants were set to 1000 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 and 500 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2, respectively. The NOE force conÊ stant was set to 50 kcal molÀ1 AÀ2 and the torsion angle force constant was initially set to 5 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2 and increased throughout the calculation to a ®nal value of 50 kcal molÀ1 radÀ2. The protocol consisted of 500 cycles of energy minimization of the randomized starting structure. This was followed by restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) at 1000 K followed by rMD during cooling to 300 K. Finally 100 cycles of energy minimization were done. All NOE distance constraints were used during the global fold protocol, however intermolecular Co(NH3)3 to the RNA distance constraints were 6 Ê given a loose, initial range of 0-10 A. Only torsion angles specifying the sugar puckers and keeping amino groups in the plane of the base-pairs were used during the global fold protocol. The second stage of structure calculation was a re®nement of the converged structures. All of the previous terms used in the global fold were used for the structure re®nement with the addition of the backbone torsion angles. The intermolecular Co(NH3)3 6 to RNA distance constraints were now assigned semiquantitative values according to the NOE data using the same criteria and categories as for the RNA nonexchangeable protons. The re®nement protocol consisted of 500 cycles of energy minimization, rMD at 1000 K during which the backbone torsion angles were introduced in two stages: ®rst, b,g, and e were introduced, followed by a and z, rMD while cooling to 300 K, and 100 cycles of energy minimization. In the ®nal stage of structure calculation, these re®ned structures underwent rMD at 300 K followed by 3000 cycles of energy minimization which now included all the terms used in the structure re®nement with the addition of Lennard-Jones

Divalent Metal Binding in an RNA Pseudoknot potentials. This structure calculation protocol resulted in a family of converged structures which were viewed using INSIGHT II.
