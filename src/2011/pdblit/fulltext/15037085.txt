Abstract--b-Lactamases are serine- and metal-dependent hydrolases, produced by the bacteria as defense against b-lactam antibiotics. Commercially available inhibitors such as clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and tazobactam, which are currently used in the hospital settings, have reduced activity against newly emerging b-lactamases. Bacterial production of diverse b-lactamases including class-A, class-C, and ESBLs has motivated several research groups to search for inhibitors with a broader spectrum of activity. Previously, several novel 6-methylidene penems bearing, [5, 5] [5, 6] and [5, 5, 5] heterocycles have been synthesized in our laboratory and were shown to be potent and broad-spectrum b-lactamase inhibitors. As a continuation of our previous work and in order to extend the structure­activity relationships, in this paper, we describe herein the synthesis and in vitro, in vivo activities of several novel 5,5,6fused tricyclic heterocycles attached to the 6-methylidene penem core. The compounds presented in the current paper are potent and broad-spectrum inhibitors of the TEM-1 and AmpC b-lactamases. In combination with piperacillin, their in vitro activities showed enhanced susceptibility to class A- and C-resistant strains studied in various bacteria. Some of the newly synthesized compounds such as 12a­c were shown to have in vivo activity in the acute lethal infection model against TEM-1 producing organisms. The 5,5,6-fused heterocyclic ring cores such as 21, 25, and 35 reported here are hitherto unknown in the literature. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Development of resistance to b-lactam antibiotics by various bacteria severely limits the use of penicillins and cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial infection.1 The most significant known mechanism related to the development of bacterial resistance to the b-lactam antibiotics is the production of class A, class B, and class C b-lactamases.2 These enzymes hydrolyze the b-lactam ring of the antibiotics and render them inactive. To overcome this, co-administering b-lactamase inhibitors with a b-lactam antibiotic is a general practice in the hospital setting. However, alterations and mutations within the b-lactamases have allowed

bacteria to overcome the effects of the b-lactamase inhibitors. The currently available inhibitors such as clavulanic acid 1, sulbactam 2, and tazobactam 3 (Fig. 1) are effective inhibitors against class A producing organisms; but are not effective against either class C or class B producing organisms.3a­c Among these classes, the most problematic b-lactamases are the class C enzymes.2 Bacterial genera such as Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Hafnia, Pseudomonas, Morganella, Providencia, and Serratia are known to express class C enzymes and confer resistance to the above-mentioned commercial products as well as extended-spectrum cephalosporins.4 In addition to class C producing bacteria, there are strains which produce multiple enzymes of class A as well as extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs),5,6a which are of great concern in terms of their incidence and treatment options.6b Thus, the treatment of infection caused by strains producing ESBLs and or AmpC b-lactamases in hospital setting is a therapeutic challenge. Therefore,

a continuous search for novel and broad-spectrum blactamase inhibitors is being actively pursued in several laboratories.7­15 We have recently shown that several 6-methylidene penems bearing a monocyclic ring,16a a 6,5-fused bicyclic heterocycle or 5,5,5-fused tricyclic heterocycle16b are effective broad-spectrum b-lactamase inhibitors.16c Compounds such as 4­6 (Fig. 1) are of particular interest because of their broad-spectrum b-lactamase inhibitory activity. These compounds were synthesized on the basis of both modeling experiments and mechanistic considerations and were found to be potent both in vitro and in vivo. High resolution crystallographic structures of 5 and 6 with SHV-1 (class A) and GC1 enzymes revealed the formation of ring expanded sevenmembered dihydro[1,4]thiazepines 7 and 8, respectively. During these experiments, the stereochemistry of the C7 carbon atom was also determined.17,18 Subsequently, the formation of ring expanded dihydro[1,4]thiazepines 7 and 8 was also supported by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry.19 As mentioned above inhibitors such as 6 displayed good in vitro activities against ESBLs and class C expressing organisms as well as in vivo activity.16b This inhibitor 6 bears a 5,5,5-fused tricyclic system as a part of the 6-methylidene penem core. Hence, in order to extend the structure­activity relationships, the terminal cyclopentyl moiety in compound 6 was replaced with more lipophilic ring systems as in examples 12a, 12d, and 12e and relatively polar ring system as depicted in example 12b, 12c, 12f, and 12g. The 5,5,6-fused heterocyclic ring cores such as 21, 25, and 35 described here are hitherto unknown in the literature. The structure­activity relationship in the series and the in vitro, in vivo data are presented in the current paper. 2. Chemistry The tricyclic heterocycle bearing 6-methylidene penem carboxylic acid sodium salts 12a­g (Scheme 1) were pre-

pared by a novel two-step aldol condensation and reductive elimination procedures as described previously.20 The pivotal starting material, namely (5R, 6S)-6-bromo-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo(3.2.0)hept-2-ene-2-carboxylic acid-4-nitrobenzyl ester 10, required for this procedure was prepared from the commercially available 6-aminopenicilanic acid (6-APA) 9 by using a modified multi-step procedure.21,22 Compound 10 was reacted with the appropriately substituted aldehydes 20, 21, 25, 27, and 33­35 in the presence of triethylamine and anhydrous MgBr2 (Scheme 1). The intermediate aldol products were trapped as their respective bromoacetoxy derivatives 11a­g. Reaction of bromoacetoxy derivatives 11a­g with activated zinc in phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 resulted in the introduction of the double bond with the `Z' geometry. During this process, the carboxyl functionality also underwent deprotection resulting in the formation of their respective sodium salts. In the case of compound 11f, about 5% quantity of the `E' isomer 13 was also formed. The sodium salts of 12a­g and 13 were obtained after purification on HP-21 resin (80 mL, Mitsubishi Kasei Co., Ltd) by reverse-phase column chromatography. The aldehydes intermediates 20, 21, 25, 27, and 33­35 required to synthesize all the final compounds were prepared as described in the following section. Aldehydes 20 and 21 required to prepare compounds 12a and 12b, were synthesized starting from the 2-chlorocyclohexanone 14 and 3-chloro tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-one 15, respectively, by a four-step process as outlined in Scheme 2. The a-chloro ketone derivatives 14 and 15 were reacted with thiourea to afford the 2-aminothiazole derivatives 16 and 17. The intermediates 16 and 17 were reacted with ethyl bromopyruvate in dimethoxyethane. The resulting tricyclic esters 18 and 19 were reduced to their corresponding alcohols using lithium aluminum hydride and then oxidized to their respective aldehydes 20 and 21 using activated manganese dioxide in refluxing chloroform for 48 h (Scheme 2). The aldehyde 25 required to synthesize compound 12c was prepared by a

similar sequence of reactions starting from compound 23 and ethyl bromopyruvate (Scheme 3). Compound 23 required for this transformation was prepared by the hydrogenation of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazolopyridine 2223a with Pd/C at room temperature at 40 psi pressure (Scheme 3). The tricyclic aldehyde 27 was synthesized starting from 1-methyl-2-amino benzimidazole 26 as indicated in Scheme 4. The tricyclic aldehydes 33­35 were synthesized by reacting ethyl-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylate 2823b and corresponding a-chloro cyclic ketones 14, 15, and 29 in the presence of K2CO3 in boiling acetonitrile as indicated in Scheme 5. 3. Biology All the compounds synthesized were tested in vitro against TEM-1 and Amp-C enzymes for their inhibitory

ability.24 b-Lactamase inhibitory activities were determined spectrophotometrically as described by Bush et al.24b using nitrocefin as substrate. IC50 values were calculated using WinNonlin (Pharsight Corp., Mountainview, CA). In each experiment, tazobactam 3 was used as a standard. The potent compounds from the above-mentioned enzyme inhibition in vitro assay were tested in the antimicrobial susceptibility assay. In this assay the in vitro activities of the antibiotic (piperacillin) and antibiotic plus inhibitors (compounds 12a­g and 13) were determined by the broth microdilution method as recommended by the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute (CLSI)25 using Mueller­Hinton II broth (MHBII, BBL Cockeysville, MD). Microtiter plates containing serial dilutions of each antimicrobial agent or antimicrobial agent plus inhibitor were inoculated with each organism to yield the appropriate density (105 CFU/ml) in a 100-ll final volume. The plates were

incubated for 18­24 h at 35 °C in ambient air. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all isolates was defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that completely inhibited the growth of the organisms as detected by the unaided eye. The MIC values presented in this article were determined for piperacillin (PIP) alone, the inhibitor alone, and the inhibitor in combination with piperacillin at a constant concentration of 4 lg/mL of the inhibitor. The potent compounds in this assay were taken to an in vivo acute lethal infection model. In this model, five dose levels per compound with five female CD-1 (Charles River Laboratories) mice at each dose level were used. Each group was injected intraperitoneally with a lethal dose (10­100 LD50) of the pathogen. The same group was injected intravenously with piperacillin alone or piperacillin combined with inhibitor (compounds 12a­g and 13) at a ratio of 4:1 (Pip:Inhibitor). The seven days survival ratios from three separate tests were pooled for determination of median effective dose (ED50) by probit analysis. 4. Structure­activity relationship All the newly synthesized 6-methylidene penem inhibitors bearing tricyclic heterocycles (6, 12a­g, and 13) are listed in Table 1.

zymes and their IC50 values are enlisted in Table 1. In all our experiments, tazobactam was used as the standard and the comparator. As can be seen from Table 1, all the newly synthesized inhibitors 12a­g with `Z' olefin geometry are potent inhibitors of both TEM-1 and AmpC enzymes with IC50 values of 1.2­24 and 0.62­ 16 nM, respectively. As compared to tazobactam, all the newly synthesized inhibitors were about 4- to 90-fold more potent against TEM-1 and about 5000- to 84,000fold more active against AmpC enzymes. All the inhibitors are modestly potent against Imi. Among the seven 6-methylidene penems reported here, compounds 12a­d represent the `imidazole'-fused tricyclic compounds and the remaining compounds bear the pyrazole ring system as a part of their tricyclic appendage. It was shown earlier16b that compound 6, which bears the imidazole ring, has broad spectrum of activities. Hence, in order to extend the structure-activity relationships the cyclopentyl moiety in compound 6 was replaced with more lipophilic cyclohexyl (example 12a) and relatively polar pyran ring system (example 12b). These modifications did not alter the in vitro activity against TEM-1. However, the cyclohexyl ring containing compound 12a is about 3- to 4fold more potent than 6 against class C enzyme.

pound 12a is 2-fold more potent against Imi when compared to the lead compound 6. When the thiazole ring in examples 6, 12a, and 12b was replaced with 1,2,4-triazole ring system as in example 12c, the potency remained almost identical to 12a and 12b against TEM-1 and AmpC, and exhibited excellent potency against Imi-1. The potency decreased as the terminal saturated rings of 6 and 12a­12c were replaced with a phenyl. Thus, compound 12d is almost 10-fold less potent against TEM-1 than compounds 6 and 12a­c. 6-Methylidene penem derivatives 12e­g bearing a pyrazole ring displayed good potency against TEM-1 and AmpC enzymes. The imidazole fused tricyclics 6 and 12a­c are more potent inhibitors of TEM-1 and AmpC as compared to the pyrazole fused tricyclic bearing penem inhibitors 12e­g. During the preparation of example 12f, a small quantity of the corresponding `E' isomer 13 was isolated and tested for in vitro activity against all of the four enzymes. As can be seen in Table 1, the potency of 13 is >50-fold weaker against TEM-1, as compared to its corresponding `Z' isomer 12f. This decrease in the potency can be explained by modeling of 12f and 13 at the TEM-1 binding site26 (Fig. 2). Our optimized protein:ligand complex models (TEM1:12f, TEM-1:13, AmpC:12f, and AmpC:13) indicated a preference for the Z isomer over E isomer (Fig. 2). b-Lactamase inhibition involves positioning of the lactam oxygen in the oxyanion hole, and subsequently, its acylation. b-Lactam and the tricyclic head groups are co-planar in the predicted bioactive conformations of 12f and 13. The shape of the Z isomeric form allows the tricyclic head group to be directed toward the opening of the binding site and still makes good H-bonding and vdW contacts with the binding site amino acids. This orientation of the tricyclic head group allows the lactam oxygen to be positioned deep into the oxyanion hole and facilitates nucleophilic attack by the active serine. In contrast, as shown in Figure 2B the E isomer places the tricyclic head group deeper into the binding site, and, thereby, pulls the lactam oxygen away from the oxyanion hole, making the acylation more difficult and resulting in weaker enzyme inhibition. It is also noteworthy to see from Figure 2B that the E isomer is less firmly embedded in the oxyanion hole and makes fewer contacts with the binding pocket residues as compared to the corresponding Z isomer (12f). These molecular modeling observations are consistent for the AmpC binding site as well. 5. In vitro antibacterial activity The in vitro effectiveness of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated in the cell-based assay by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). These data are summarized in Table 2, which also lists the expressing enzyme and its class. In all these experiments, piperacillin was combined with the newly synthesized inhibitors and tested against different piperacillin-resistant bacteria (MIC > 64 lg/mL) expressing various b-lactamases. The piperacillin + tazobactam combination was used for comparison. At the onset, it

is important to note that, when tested alone, both the tazobactam and the newly synthesized inhibitors (6, 12a­g, and 13) did not exhibit any antibacterial activity (data not shown) against the isolates used in this study, which established the lack of inherent antibacterial activity. The newly synthesized compounds 6, 12a­g, and 13, and tazobactam, when combined with piperacillin at a constant 4 lg/mL concentration, reduced the MIC values (except 12d and 13) of piperacillin (>64 lg/mL) against TEM-1 producing isolates. However, it is evident from Table 2 that even though the tazobactam plus piperacillin combination has synergy against class A producing isolates, this combination is less effective against most class C b-lactamase producing organisms (S. marcescus is an exception). The addition of the newly synthesized inhibitors such as 6, 12a and 12b effectively reduced the MIC value and restored the susceptibility to piperacillin for the class C producing organisms. Among the newly synthesized inhibitors, the imidazole-fused tricyclic derivatives attached to the 6-methylidene penem moiety 12a­c are more effective than the pyrazole ring-containing compounds such as 12e­g. Compound 12g, in spite of its low IC50 values, exhibited poor whole cell activity. It is noteworthy that all the newly synthesized compounds reported here exhibited good aqueous solution state stability in the pH range of 7­8.5. 6. In vivo efficacy The in vivo efficacy data (ED50 values) of piperacillin and the most potent inhibitors 12a­c (4:1 ratio) are listed in Table 3. These data were generated in a murine acute lethal infection model with Escherichia coli LSU 80-8 (a TEM-1 producing organism).16b In all these experiments, tazobactam was used for comparison. When piperacillin was administered alone (IV), it did not have efficacy (ED50 > 128 mg/kg) against E. coli LS80-8. However, when piperacillin was combined with the newly synthesized inhibitors 6 and 12a­c, reduced ED50 values in the range of 19­32 mg/kg were observed. In the same experiment, tazobactam demonstrated similar effectiveness against E. coli LSU 80-8. 7. Conclusions Guided by the mechanistic understanding, computational chemistry and as an extension to our previous work, several novel tricyclic heterocycle-substituted 6methylidene penem molecules were synthesized. Many of these molecules are potent and broad-spectrum b-lactamase inhibitors. During the course of this investigation, several novel tricyclic aldehydes 20, 21, 25, 27, and 33­35 were synthesized. The newly synthesized 6methylidene penem derivatives 6, 12a­c, and 12e­g have a broader spectrum of activity than any of the currently available inhibitors on the market. They were shown to have good in vitro activity against both class A and class C enzymes. In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing studies demonstrated that, the newly synthesized compounds 12a­c, 12e, and 12f reduced the MIC values of
