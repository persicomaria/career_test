Toxin B is a member of the family of large clostridial cytotoxins which are of great medical importance. Its catalytic fragment was crystallized in the ° presence of UDP-glucose and Mn2C. The structure was determined at 2.2 A resolution, showing that toxin B belongs to the glycosyltransferase type A family. However, toxin B contains as many as 309 residues in addition to the common chainfold, which most likely contribute to the target specificity. A superposition with other glycosyltransferases shows the expected positions of the acceptor oxygen atom during glucosyl transfer and indicates further that the reaction proceeds probably along a singledisplacement pathway. The C1 00 donor carbon atom position is defined by the bound UDP and glucose. It assigns the surface area of toxin B that forms the interface to the target protein during the modifying reaction. A docking attempt brought the known acceptor atom, Thr37 Og1 of the switch I region of the RhoA:GDP target structure, near the expected position. The relative orientation of the two proteins was consistent with both being attached to a membrane. Sequence comparisons between toxin B variants revealed that the highest exchange rate occurs around the active center at the putative docking interface, presumably due to a continuous hit-and-evasion struggle between Clostridia and their eukaryotic hosts.

Introduction
The spore-forming prokaryote Clostridium difficile is the causative agent of pseudomembranous colitis, which occurs during or shortly after antibiotic therapy and is of great medical and economical importance.1­3 C. difficile releases the two potent exotoxins A and B that belong to the family of large clostridial toxins, which also includes lethal toxin and haemorrhagic toxin from Clostridium sordellii as well as a-toxin from Clostridium novyi. These toxins accommodate all their functions on a single peptide of about 300 kDa. Currently, three parts of the peptide chain are assigned.4 It is suggested that the C-terminal part binds to the target cell receptor,

which is followed by endocytosis of the toxin. The central part is considered to mediate the translocation of an N-terminal fragment from the endosomes to the cytoplasm. Once in the cytosol, the N-terminal fragment glycosylates Rho proteins,5,6 which are molecular switches involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes like actin cytoskeleton and microtubule dynamics, cell polarity, gene expression, cell-cycle progression and various enzyme activities.7 The toxin B fragment modifies residue Thr37 of RhoA (Thr35 of Rac or Cdc42) that is crucial for signaling.5 Some members of the toxin family, e.g. lethal toxin from C. sordellii, also inactivate proteins of the Ras subfamily.8,9 The transferred group is usually a glucosyl unit derived from UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), only a-toxin from C. novyi prefers UDPN-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).4 In the absence of a target, the toxins hydrolyze the nucleotide­sugar in a slow reaction.10 All reactions retain the anomeric conformation. Here, we report the crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of toxin B from C. difficile in complex with UDP$Mn2C

Results
Structure determination and description While toxin B from C. difficile strain VPI 10463 is comprised of a total of 2365 residues (accession code P18177), the catalytic fragment reaching the cytosol consists only of residues 1­543.11 Here, we generated the fragment 1­546 with an additional N-terminal 12 residue linker left over from the production process, which in the following is referred to as ToxB. In vitro, the catalytic properties of ToxB are identical with those of the full toxin B with respect to transferase and hydrolase activity.12 ToxB was cocrystallized with its substrate UDP-Glc and manganese ions that are required for catalysis.10 The crystals were very fragile and belonged to space group P212121 with one ToxB molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit. The structure was solved using two heavy-atom derivatives. However, the usual combined phase determination was not possible, because we encountered severe non-isomorphism as indicated by changes of the b-axis from crystal to crystal (Table 1). Initial phases were obtained from the cisdiamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisPt) derivative data in conjunction with the native data (Table 1) using the single isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method and subsequent density modification. As the cisPt data were collected near the L-absorption edge, a substantial anomalous signal that is not affected by non-isomorphism gave rise to phases of reasonable quality. A second independent set of phases was derived from multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data of a crystal soaked with Ta6Br14. These phases were from a

single crystal and therefore also independent of non-isomorphism. The two phase sets were combined at the level of partial models, yielding a ° complete protein model that was refined at 2.2 A resolution together with the bound tantalum clusters (Table 2). The structure of the (tantalumfree) native crystal was then established by molecular replacement and refined at medium resolution. ° The 2.2 A resolution model contained residues 1­543, which is exactly the fragment transferred to the cytosol.11 The three additional C-terminal residues and the N-terminal linker were not structured and are ignored in the following. The lack of a rotational symmetry axis in the crystals confirms the general assumption that ToxB is monomeric. A superposition of the two models derived from the tantalum and the native crystals showed a good agreement with an overall rmsd of ° 0.67 A for the main chains. The maximum deviation ° was 4.5 A at Arg165 in a crystal contact. A superposition of the two unit cells revealed relative ° molecular displacements of up to 6 A, explaining the unit cell axis changes, the non-isomorphism and the fragility of the crystals.

derived from the tantalum crystals was of superior quality, it was used throughout. Presumably, the bound tantalum cluster improved the crystalline order because the respective crystals showed higher resolution diffraction and lower B-factors than the native and, in particular, than the cisPt crystal (Table 1). The structure of ToxB is depicted in Figure 1, emphasizing the central, mostly parallel b-sheet. According to the topology of this sheet with its surrounding chain segments, ToxB can be assigned clearly to the glycosyltransferase type A (GT-A) family of enzymes.13 Using only the central (blue) part of ToxB, a DALI14 search for structural homologs yielded Z-scores of 10.1, 9.8, 9.3 and 8.8 for the GT-A family members glycogenin,15 LgtC,16

a3GalT17 and GnT1,18 respectively, and Z-scores of 6.7 and below 5 for five others (Protein Data Bank codes 1FGX, 1QG8, 1FGG, 1OMX and 1XHB). While the common transferase chainfold consists of 234 residues, the structured part of ToxB contains as many as 309 additional residues, which are marked green in Figure 1. These are distributed in a 91 residue N-terminal domain and three large protuberances of 93, 65 and 40 residues as well as the 20 residue C-terminal helix. All additions are a-helical. UDP-Glc binding site ToxB was cocrystallized with UDP-Glc and Mn2C. Due to the hydrolytic activity of ToxB, however, UDP-Glc was cleaved during the

The UDP-Glc used for cocrystallization is clearly hydrolyzed to UDP and a-D-glucose in a reaction retaining the anomeric configuration.

976 crystallization period of four weeks. The products UDP and a-D-glucose were identified in detail in the electron density (Figure 2). They were bound in a pocket formed by b2, b5 and b10 as well as a12, a18 and loop 510­523, in agreement with other GT-A family members.13 The glucose is bound especially tightly to the side-chains of a hydrogen-bonded Asp270-Arg273-Asp286 arrangement at the bottom of the active-center pocket. This group of residues forms six hydrogen bonds to the 3 00 , 4 00 and 6 00 hydroxyl groups of the glucose molecule, keeping it tucked underneath the phosphate groups so that the glycosidic bond of UDP-Glc is exposed to the solvent (Figure 2). Asp286 of this group is the first acid of the common DxD motif of the GT-A family. In ToxB, it forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule of the Mn2C coordination sphere; in some family members it contacts Mn2C directly.19 Asp288 binds to Mn2C as observed with most other family members. The 2 00 -hydroxyl group of the glucose is hydrogen-bonded to the b-phosphate group. The same applies to the 1 00 -hydroxyl group that was introduced by hydrolysis. The displacement of the C1 00 atom of the glucose molecule on hydrolysis is ° 1.5 A. The b-side of C1 00 is encircled by a non-polar mold formed by the side-chains of Ile383, Ile466, Pro471 and Trp520, as shown in Figure 3. This mold and the Asp270-Arg273-Asp286 arrangement described above are present in the other large clostridial toxins. All of the large clostridial toxins can use UDP-Glc as a substrate. However, a-toxin from C. novyi shows a much higher activity for UDP-GlcNAc.4,6 Now, this exception can be explained clearly by the ToxB structure, because a-toxin contains a serine residue and an alanine residue instead of Ile383 and Gln385 that, for steric reasons, exclude binding of the 2 00 -Nacetyl group in ToxB. This difference was confirmed by producing the respective double mutant of ToxB and demonstrating that it accepts UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate (our unpublished results).

Structure and Function of Clostridial Toxin

Reaction geometry and mechanism The catalytic center of ToxB was superimposed with those of the two closely related GT-A family members LgtC16 and a3GalT17 (Figure 3). LgtC binds a fluoridated UDP-glucose analog that shows directly the position of the C1 00 donor carbon atom. Moreover, the structure contains the acceptor analog 4-deoxy-Gal-b(1.4)-Glc, which allows us to model the acceptor 4-hydroxyl group of the Gal moiety to reveal the acceptor oxygen position. The structure of a3GalT contains UDP, as well as the genuine acceptor N-acetyl-lactosamine that shows directly the acceptor oxygen position (Figure 3). Since the two acceptor atoms superimpose well, and since the donor atoms are at essentially identical positions, the average of the acceptor positions of LgtC and a3GalT can be considered with great confidence as the acceptor position of ToxB. The positions of the C1 00 donor and the hydroxyl receptor define the reaction geometry of ToxB. During the docking process, the hydroxyl group of the targeted threonine residue of the Rho protein has to reach the putative acceptor position, where it should then be activated by a base and deprotonated during the reaction. This may be achieved by Glu515, which binds to the Mn2C and is at a ° distance of 4 A from the acceptor oxygen position, or by the b-phosphoryl group.20 It seems more likely, however, that the deprotonation is performed by a water molecule between Glu515, the b-phosphoryl group and the acceptor oxygen that is present in the crystal structure of ToxB (Figure 3). ToxB glucosylates its target with net retention of the a-anomeric conformation present in UDP-Glc.21 This suggests a double-displacement mechanism running through a glucosyl-enzyme intermediate. Experimental data supporting the double-displacement mechanism have been put forward for the related retaining glycosyltransferases a3GalT17 and

These segments are the carbonyl ends of the parallel b-strands at the active center. The LgtC structure contains UDP-(2 00 F)Gal, which is not hydrolyzed, and 4-deoxy-Gal-b(1,4)-Glc (gray) as an acceptor analog. The Gal moiety of this analog is amended by a modeled 4-hydroxyl group (yellow ball). The a3GalT structure contains UDP with the acceptor N-acetyllactosamine (green, acetyl group truncated), the accepting oxygen atom of which is marked by an orange ball. The C1 00 donor atom of the LgtC structure is emphasized by a cyan ball. The distance between the accepting oxygen atoms ° (yellow and orange) and the donor carbon atom (cyan) is about 2.5 A.

977 sated by the three positive charges of Arg273 and Mn2C. The cytosolic targets of ToxB are small GTPases of the Rho subfamily, of which RhoA is used here as a representative. The Rho proteins are not attacked when in their GTP-bound conformation5,26 or when their switch I region is buried in a cytosolic complex with guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI).27,28 The switch I region is exposed in the GDP-bound conformation, however, so that Thr37 Og1 is available for a modifying enzyme. For glucosylation, ToxB has to dock at RhoA. Clearly established fix points for this transient complex are the position of the C1 00 donor carbon atom of ToxB and the Thr37 Og1 acceptor oxygen atom of RhoA. We therefore attempted to dock the structure of RhoA:GDP29 onto ToxB, trying to bring donor and acceptor as close together as possible. This resulted ° in a residual distance of 7 A between the expected acceptor position of ToxB (Figure 3) and the putative docking position of Thr37 Og1 as shown ° in Figure 4(a). This residual 7 A distance can be

LgtC.22 However, these data cannot be considered as conclusive. The superposition of Figure 3 demonstrates that the hydrolyzed a-D-glucose bound to ToxB is located in the expected position, tucked underneath the phosphate groups of UDP and bound tightly to the Asp270-Arg273-Asp286 group of residues. In ToxB, the C1 00 atom is surrounded by a mold formed by non-polar residues and there is no nucleophile at a position suitable for an attack of the b-side of C1 00 , so that a double-displacement mechanism is most unlikely. Following previous analyses of retaining glycosyltransferases,16,20,23­25 we therefore propose a singledisplacement mechanism (also called SNi) for the large clostridial toxins. Such a mechanism seems to be supported by the ToxB structure, because the required short-lived oxocarbenium intermediate is stabilized electrostatically by the three net negative charges near the glucosyl unit. This charge imbalance arises out of six negative charges of the surrounding phosphate and carboxylate groups (residues 270, 286, 288 and 515) that are compen-

978 overcome by a conformational change of the switch I region of RhoA:GDP, as there is enough free space in the putative docking complex. As illustrated in Figure 4(b), this region (residues 30­42) changes its conformation drastically between the complexes RhoA:GDP, RhoA:Mg 2CGDP and RhoA:GTP, indicating a high degree of mobility. It should be noted that the putative docking arrangement brings the N-terminal domain of ToxB and the C-terminal helix of RhoA (both marked yellow) to the same side of Figure 4. While it has been shown that the N-terminal domains of ToxB and lethal toxin attach to the membrane,30 the C terminus of RhoA has a thioether-linked prenyl chain known to dip into the membrane.31 Accord-

ingly, both termini should point to the membrane during the docking process, which is consistent with Figure 4. The conservation of the ToxB surface during evolution is shown in Figure 5. Surprisingly, the exchanges among the C. difficile ToxB isoforms concentrate at the surface around the C1 00 donor atom at the active center, which is the docking interface to the target protein. This seems to contradict the usual experience, that such interfaces are well conserved. We suggest, therefore, that these amino acid exchanges were introduced to overcome evasive modifications of the host cells and/or to increase the specificity of the toxin for the GTPases that favor the survival of the pathogen.

979 the development meets general expectations. A comparison between the large clostridial toxin A (accession code P16154), toxin B (P18177), lethal toxin (Q46342) and a-toxin (Q46149), which, on average, have 44% identical residues in binary comparisons, shows exchanges all over the surface, whereas the inner parts of the protein structures are conserved, as usual with any protein. This demonstrates that, in the long run, the particularities of the toxin functions become less important than the protein structure stability. Accordingly, such shortlived battlefield interfaces should be distinguished from the common long-lived beneficial interfaces as observed, for instance, in signaling chains.

Discussion
The catalytic fragments of the large clostridial toxins are members of the GT-A family with respect to the common chainfold and the catalyzed reaction. However, the structural differences are immense, as these fragments are more than double the size of the common chainfold (Figure 1). The additions form a collar of protrusions around the C1 00 donor atom at the active center (Figure 4) that most likely contributes to the specificity for the target. Since all additions are a-helical, they also underline the decisive difference between b-sheets and a-helices for the polypeptide folding process: it seems extremely difficult to invent or change a b-sheet but comparatively simple to add a-helices to any given place. The superposition of Figure 3 shows the close relationship between ToxB and other structurally GT-A family members at the active center. Despite the rather distant chainfold similarity, as demonstrated by DALI14 Z-scores of merely 10.1 and below, the positions of the C1 00 donor atoms and of the acceptor hydroxyl groups agree with each other closely. The common DxD motif of the glycosyltransferases is involved in binding the glucosyl group and Mn2C. In Figure 3, the Mn2C positions ° spread over a range of 1­2 A. In ToxB, Mn2C is shifted toward and bound to Glu515, which may participate in activating the acceptor hydroxyl group. Because of its coordination to Mn 2C, however, a direct deprotonation by Glu515 appears unlikely. In the superposition in Figure 3, we refrained from considering the active center of the third structurally known retaining glycosyltransferase glycogenin,15 because in this case the glucosyl moiety of UDP-Glc is obviously not bound at its natural site. In the structure analysis of glycogenin, UDP-Glc was not cocrystallized but was introduced by soaking, so that it had to fit the already existing crystal structure that contained a packing contact near the expected glucosyl-binding site. This has probably caused the glucosyl unit to point with its C4 00 atom away from the phosphate groups instead of being tucked underneath the phosphate groups and bound to the Asp270-Arg273-Asp286 arrangement (in glycogenin: Asp-Lys-Asp). The localization of the ToxB target docking surface around the active center (Figure 4) is consistent with activity measurements of chimeras between ToxB and the catalytic fragment of the C. sordellii lethal toxin, which demonstrated that peptide 365­516 carries the specificity of ToxB.32 Unfortunately, this peptide is much too large for defining the docking area more precisely. Positional improvement may be achieved in future mutational scans of the two protein surfaces. The amino acid exchanges between ToxB isoforms depicted in Figure 5 emerged in a competitive setting over a short evolutionary period. They are obviously function-driven and therefore follow unusual rules. Over longer evolutionary periods, however,

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification and crystallization Mutant Y59C-E244G-S542A of the catalytic fragment of toxin B from C. difficile was overexpressed as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein in Escherichia coli. GST was cut off with thrombin, leaving a 12 residue N-terminal linker. The mutations had been introduced unintentionally. They caused neither in vivo nor in vitro detectable changes in the biological activity. In retrospect, they were inside (Y59) and on the surface (E244 and S542) of the protein in locations unlikely to influence the structure or function. After purification by gelpermeation chromatography in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, ToxB was dialyzed overnight against 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and then concentrated. The protein was crystallized in hanging drops at 293 K. A drop consisted of 1.25 ml of protein solution (11 mg/ml of ToxB, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mM UDP-Glc (Fluka), 2 mM MnCl2) and 1.5 ml of reservoir buffer (100 mM Mes (pH 6.2­6.5), 125­200 mM (NH4)2SO4, 18­23% (w/v) PEG 8000). Crystals appeared within three weeks and reached their final size of 200 mm!200 mm!1000 mm within four weeks. Since no storage buffer could be found, heavyatom derivatives were obtained by adding the respective compound to the drop. Before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, the crystals were transferred within about one minute in three steps to reservoir buffer containing 30% (w/v) glucose for the Ta6Br14 and cis-(NH3)2Cl2Pt(II) derivatives, or 30% (v/v) glycerol for the native crystal. Data collection and phasing All data were collected at the Swiss Light Source (beamline X06SA) and processed using the program XDS (Table 1).33 Seven cisPt sites were established with SHELXD34 and refined with SHARP.35 The cisPt data set and the native data set were used to establish SIRAS ° phases, which were then extended to 2.6 A resolution by density modification using SHARP in conjunction with SOLOMON36 and DM.36 The resulting electron density yielded merely half the model. The three tantalum data sets were then used to locate the atoms of one Ta6Br2C 12 cluster with programs SHELXD and SHARP, and to calculate MAD phases and a low-quality electron density map (Table 1). Subsequently, the rather crude model derived from the cisPt map was placed in the tantalumderived map using MOLREP.36 The tantalum-derived phases were combined with the model phases using RESOLVE.37 Three cycles of automatic rebuilding with

980
RESOLVE including manual corrections after each cycle resulted in an 80% complete model. At this stage, we changed to ARP/wARP38 and finished the model. Refinement and modeling ° Using REFMAC5,36 the model was then refined at 2.2 A resolution (Table 2). This resolution was obtained only with the high-energy-remote tantalum data set so that, from the start, the model included the Ta6Br2C cluster 12 used for phasing. At later stages of the refinement, three 2C further Ta6Br12 clusters with lower occupancies were identified in anomalous difference Fourier maps and added to the model. Water molecules were automatically introduced by ARP/wARP. Finally the whole asymmetric unit was assigned as a single TLS group.36 The structure of the native crystals was solved by molecular replacement using the refined protein model derived from the tantalum crystal. The native model was first improved by simulated annealing with CNS,39 and then refined with ° REFMAC5.The resolution reached only 2.6 A (Table 2). Manual model building was done with programs O40 and XtalView.41 Ligand libraries were created with PRODRG.42 Figures were prepared using POVScriptC43 and POVRAY. Searches for structurally related proteins were performed with DALI.14 Sequence alignments were prepared with DIALIGN,44 and structural alignments with LSQKAB.36 Rigid body docking calculations were carried out using FTDock45 and RPScore.46 Surface complementarity and electrostatics,45 pair potential46 and the distance between Glc C1 00 and Thr37 O1 were used as selection criteria. The top-scoring complex was chosen as the putative model.
