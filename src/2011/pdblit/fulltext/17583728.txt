Blood coagulation: The outstanding hydrophobic residues
Jean-Luc Pellequer, Andrew J. Gale and Elizabeth D. Getzoff

Newly determined crystal structures suggest that the membrane-binding C2 domains of blood coagulation cofactors Va and VIIIa bind anionic phospholipids through protruding solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues, aided by a crown of positively charged residues and by specific hydrogen-bonding side chains.

phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine on the cell surface, generating a procoagulant surface for the prothrombinase and tenase complexes [2]. The preference for naturally occurring phosphatidyl-L-serine, rather than phosphatidyl-D-serine, implies a stereospecific recognition of phospholipids by cofactors Va and VIIIa [3,4]. Cofactors Va and VIIIa bind to anionic phospholipids, in a Ca2+-independent manner, through their light chains. These binding reactions have apparent dissociation constants in the nanomolar range, and there is little or no effect of ionic strength in relevant physiological conditions. The available evidence suggests that the C2 domain of each cofactor mediates this binding, although a contribution from the A3 domain of cofactor Va has been suggested. A mechanism for the interaction between these two C2 domains and phospholipid membranes has now been proposed on the basis of their recently determined crystal structures [5,6].
Structural analysis of cofactor C2 domains

The blood coagulation cascade is activated in response to vascular damage and culminates in the generation of thrombin at sites of injury, resulting in the formation of a blood clot composed of platelets and fibrin. Thrombin is generated by the prothrombinase complex consisting of coagulation cofactor Va, a non-enzymatic cofactor; factor Xa, a serine protease; phospholipid membranes and calcium (Figure 1). Factor X is proteolytically activated to factor Xa by a similar complex, the so-called tenase complex which consists of coagulation cofactor VIIIa, factor IXa, phospholipids and calcium (Figure 1). Inherited deficiencies of the coagulation factors are important causes of blood disorders -- for example, a deficiency of factor VIII causes hemophilia A, while a deficiency of factor V causes parahemophilia [1]. Factors V and VIII have very similar sequences and the same subunit organization, with six major domains in the sequence A1­A2­B­A3­C1­C2. Upon cofactor activation, the B domain is removed by limited proteolysis catalysed by either factor Xa or thrombin [1]. The prothrombinase and tenase complexes bind anionic phospholipid membranes, especially those containing phosphatidyl-L-serine; this binding increases the catalytic efficiency of the respective serine proteases by three to five orders of magnitude. Phospholipids are believed to concentrate substrates and enzymes in space, increasing the rate of productive cleavage, and also to facilitate two-dimensional transfer of coagulation factors between the various complexes (Figure 1). In human platelet membranes, anionic phosphatidylserine lipids are sequestered in the inner membrane layer, whereas neutral phospholipids such as sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine form the outer layer. This asymmetry in lipid distribution is maintained by an ATP-dependent amino-phospholipid translocase. On activation of blood platelets and blood cells by thrombin, this translocase activity is blocked and a calciumdependent lipid `scramblase' randomizes exposure of

In both factor V and factor VIII, the C2 domain fold is a distorted jelly-roll  barrel, divided into one fivestranded and one three-stranded  sheet (Figure 2a). The global shape is a cylinder of about 45 Å in length
Figure 1

Protein components of the blood coagulation cascade. (a) The phospholipid-bound tenase complex -- cofactor VIIIa, activated factor IX and factor X -- proteolytically cleaves factor X to form the activated factor X. The activated factor X serine protease then assembles with cofactor Va and II to form the pro-thrombinase complex, which in turn cleaves factor II to release thrombin (factor IIa). (b) Cofactors Va and VIIIa each have a heavy chain (green) of homologous domains A1 and A2, and a light chain (purple) made up of a third A domain (A3) followed by two C domains (C1 and C2). Sequence numbers -- for cofactor Va above and cofactor VIIIa below -- refer to amino acids in the uncleaved polypeptides. Crystal structures have now been determined for the C2 domains of both cofactors Va and VIIIa [5,6].

Figure 2 Stereo views of the C2 domains of cofactors VIII and V. (a) A ribbon diagram of the factor VIII C2 domain shows the eight-stranded -barrel divided into three-stranded (lime green) and five-stranded (red) antiparallel -sheets. A disulfide bond (purple, top left) connects the amino and carboxyl termini. Two -hairpins (green) protrude off the bottom of the -barrel, and expose hydrophobic side chains -- red for factor VIII and green for factor V -- which are proposed to insert into the phospholipid bilayer. The thin lines, red for factor VIII and green for factor V, represent the proposed orientation of C2 domains relative to a membrane. (b) Superposed crystallographic structures of the factor VIII C2 domain (red) and both the open (green) and closed (light gray) conformations of the factor V C2 domain. The largest difference in loop conformations occurs in the first -hairpin loop (bottom right) that contains the proposed membrane-anchoring residues. Disulfide bridges are shown in red for factor VIII and green for factor V (open conformation). (c) Superposed C2 domain structures of factor VIII and factor V (open conformation), showing the proposed membrane-binding motifs that include solvent-exposed hydrophobic side chains (red for factor VIII, green for factor V) and a crown of positively charged residues located around the surface of the factor VIII (purple) and factor V (cyan) C2 domains. The view is rotated by 90° from the plane of the paper compared to those in panels (a) and (b).

domain of galactose oxidase and the C2 domains is unusual -- the observed root-mean-square deviation of 2 Å between the backbone atoms in the protein core would imply a sequence identity of 27% [11], whereas the actual sequence identity is less than 15% [8,9]. This shows that, despite extremely low sequence identity, structural similarity can be successfully identified by a careful analysis of protein sequences in the context of a known structural template.

and 30 Å in diameter. In both sequence and structure, these C2 domains belong to the discoidin family of binding proteins [7], and are quite different from the C2 domains of protein kinase C, phospholipases and synaptotagmin, despite their similar phospholipid-binding properties and nomenclature. The crystallographic structures of the C2 domains of factor V and factor VIII [5,6] are similar to each other, with a rootmean-square deviation of 0.5 Å for the backbone atoms of core residues (which show 43% sequence identity), and also to earlier models of C2 structures [8,9] that were based on the homologous substrate-binding domain of galactose oxidase [10], another member of the discoidin family. The strong structural homology between the substrate-binding

A striking feature of the C2 domain structures is that, in three distinct areas, hydrophobic residues stand out and are exposed to the solvent (Figure 2). In two protruding -hairpin loops at one end of the  barrel (Figures 2a,b), these side chains -- methionine 2199, phenylalanine 2200 and leucines 2251 and 2252 in factor VIII, and tryptophans 2063 and 2064 and leucine 2116 in factor V -- are proposed to participate in membrane binding by insertion into the phospholipid bilayer [5,6,8,9]. The third area -- involving prolines 2299 and 2300 and leucine 2302 in factor VIII, and prolines 2166 and 2167 and isoleucine 2169 in factor V -- is located at the opposite end of the C2 domain cylinder, near the amino and carboxyl termini and probably interacts with the C1 domain [6,9]. The first -hairpin loop has a slightly different conformation in factor VIII, where it is formed by residues 2196­2203, and factor V, where it is formed by residues 2060­2067 (Figure 2a). But this -hairpin loop also adopts two different conformations -- referred to as `closed' and `open' -- in the two crystal forms of the factor V C2 domain [5]. The authors speculate that the closed confor-mation, with tryptophan 2064 sequestered from solvent, reflects the plasma-circulating state of

factor V, while the open conformation, with tryptophan 2064 solvent exposed, reflects the protein's membranebinding state. Unless specified, we shall compare the open form of the factor V C2 to the factor VIII C2 domain. In the structure of the factor VIII C2 domain [6], an additional solvent-exposed hydrophobic side chain can be seen, that of valine 2223, which is also proposed to participate in phospholipid binding. Both the factor V and factor VIII C2 domains have overall positive charges -- +11 and +4, respectively. Positive electrostatic potential is scattered all over the domain surface [9,10], but the structures [5,6] show that several positively charged side chains form a crown (Figure 2c). From molecular modelling analysis, we earlier suggested [9] that the solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues and the crown of positively charged residues together form the phospholipid-binding sites of the C2 domains. This suggestion is supported by the two crystal structures [5,6]. Solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues have also been observed on other membrane-binding proteins, including the phosphatidylserine-binding domain of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors [2], and the annexin V molecule [12]. Hydrophobic anchorage into the phospholipid membrane explains the minor effect that calcium ion concentration has on membrane binding by factor V and factor VIII. But the large overall positive charge of the C2 domains may drive the binding toward anionic phospholipids, explaining the apparent complexity of factor V binding to the membrane and the difficulty in analyzing it [13]. The structure of the factor V C2 domain [5] provides more detailed predictions about phosphatidylserine binding. The authors have proposed specific atomic interactions between one or two phosphatidylserine head groups and residues located in a groove enclosed between the two protruding -hairpin loops that carry exposed hydrophobic side chains. If a complex of factor V and phospholipid head groups can be co-crystallized, determination of its structure should further our understanding of how the protein specifically binds phosphatidyl-L-serine. The proposed membrane-binding orientations of the two C2 domains are shown in Figure 2a. The factor VIII C2 domain is tilted relative to the factor V C2 domain because of the additional solvent-exposed hydrophobic residue valine 2223. From a recent electron crystallography analysis at 15 Å resolution, however, the long axis of the factor VIII C2 domain was suggested to be perpendicular to the phospholipid membrane [14]. The new crystal structures [5,6] will allow additional site-directed mutants to be designed and characterized in the hope of further refining the correct orientations of the C2 domains with respect to the phospholipid membranes.

Mutational analysis

More than 250 missense mutations in factor VIII are known to cause hemophilia A [15]. The available crystal structures [5,6] and molecular modeling techniques have made possible a detailed analysis of the structural effects of known mutations in the C2 domain. In the case of the factor VIII C2 domain, the structural consequences of 21 mutations were analysed by Pratt et al. [6] and ourselves [16]. For the most part, the conclusions drawn from these two analysis are in agreement. For instance, on the basis of molecular modelling and conservation of the residue throughout the discoidin family, we suggested [16] that a mutation of arginine 2209 -- on the large loop between  strands 1 and 2 -- would have a structural effect. The crystal structure of the factor VIII C2 domain [6] confirmed that this residue has an important structural role as a result of its participation in an extensive hydrogen bond network. There is, however, a difference worth noting between the two sets of conclusions [6,16]. Pratt et al. [6] suggested that, because they lack an obvious structural role, solventexposed residues tryptophan 2229, arginine 2304 and arginine 2307 may be involved in protein­protein interactions, possibly with von Willebrand factor. But these residues are highly conserved in the discoidin family of protein domains, suggesting that they do have a structural role in this protein family. That they also have a structural role in the factor VIII C2 domain is supported by the observation that mutation of arginine 2307 to either glutamine or leucine causes a defect in secretion of the protein from cells in which it is produced [17] -- secretory defects of this kind are commonly caused by mutations that disrupt protein folding. Further experimental studies and analysis are required to unravel the roles of these residues in the factor VIII molecule.
