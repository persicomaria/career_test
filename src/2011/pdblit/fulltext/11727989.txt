Abstract The relative importance of paramagnetism-based constraints (i.e. pseudocontact shifts, residual dipolar couplings and nuclear relaxation enhancements) with respect to classical constraints in solution structure determinations of paramagnetic metalloproteins has been addressed. The protein selected for the study is a calcium binding protein, calbindin D9k , in which one of the two calcium ions is substituted with cerium(III). From 1823 NOEs, 191 dihedral angles, 15 hydrogen bonds, 769 pseudocontact shifts, 64 orientational constraints, 26 longitudinal relaxation rates, plus 969 pseudocontact shifts from other lanthanides, a final family with backbone r.m.s.d. from the average of 0.25 Å was obtained. Then, several families of structures were generated either by removing subsets of paramagnetism-based constraints or by removing increasing numbers of NOEs. The results show the relative importance of the various paramagnetism-based constraints and their good complementarity with the diamagnetic ones. Although a resolved structure cannot be obtained with paramagnetism-based constraints only, it is shown that a reasonably well resolved backbone fold can be safely obtained by retaining as few as 29 randomly chosen long-range NOEs using the standard version of the program PSEUDYANA.

Introduction In the early 1980s the basis were laid down for the solution structure determination of proteins (Wüthrich, 1996). In the beginning the structural constraints were essentially NOEs and 3 J coupling values and the software was essentially based on optimisation of the dihedral angles of polypeptides in order to match the NOE based distances and the ranges of dihedral angles determined by the 3 J values (Güntert et al., 1991; Güntert and Wüthrich, 1991). The NOEs do not provide precise distances as they are affected by mobility and spin diffusion. Even the angle constraints were

used with large tolerance. As a consequence, a good structure was, and still is, the result of as many as possible constraints. During the years new constraints have been used into structure calculations: angles obtained from cross-correlation effects (Reif et al., 1997), residual dipolar couplings (rdc) when the protein is partially oriented in high magnetic fields (Tolman et al., 1995; Tjandra et al., 1996, 1997; Vold and Prosser, 1996; Bax and Tjandra, 1997) and hydrogen bonds (Cordier and Grzesiek, 1999), together with constraints derived from the Chemical Shift Index (CSI) (Wishart et al., 1991; Gagne' et al., 1994). The strong interest for new constraints arises from the need of solving structures without NOEs or with relatively few of them. Indeed,

86 the assignment of protein signals is less limited by the protein size than the obtainment of NOE crosspeaks (Yamazaki et al., 1997) (Salzmann et al., 1999; Hus et al., 2000). In proteins containing paramagnetic metal ions paramagnetism-based constraints can be exploited (Bertini et al., 2001c). They are the contact shifts, the pseudocontact shifts, the hyperfine shifts as sum of the two, and the relaxation enhancements. The contact shifts, whenever available, contain structural information in principle, although only in a few cases a relationship was proposed (Bertini et al., 1994). The use of hyperfine shifts as such was suggested in the case of low spin heme proteins (Bertini et al., 1999). The pseudocontact shifts (pcs) (Banci et al., 1996, 1998a; Kechuan and Gochin, 1999), which are operative in the presence of magnetic anisotropy, are given by the following equation (Kurland and McGarvey, 1970): 1 pcs [ ax (3 cos2 i - 1) i = (1) 12ri3 + 3 rh sin2 i cos 2i ], 2 where ax and rh are the axial and rhombic anisotropy parameters of the magnetic susceptibility tensor of the metal, ri is the distance between the atom i and the metal ion, and i and i are the spherical polar angles of atom i with respect to the principal axes of the magnetic susceptibility tensor centred on the metal ion. The occurrence of magnetic anisotropy causes partial orientation in high magnetic field, which generates rdc (Tolman et al., 1995; Tjandra et al., 1996; Vold and Prosser, 1996; Bax and Tjandra, 1997). The equation describing this effect is similar to that of pcs. However, the metal nucleus distance is not present as a parameter, and the magnetic anisotropy is that of the whole protein instead of that of the metal ion (Banci et al., 1998a). In the system studied here the two anisotropies are very close. R1p and R2p (where p stays for paramagnetic) are proportional to r -6 , where r is the distance between the unpaired electron and the resonating nucleus. As such, they are constraints similar to NOEs (Bertini et al., 1996). R1p involves many more nuclei than R2p , as diamagnetic R2 > R1 . For R1p , cross-relaxation tends to equalize the values (Granot, 1982; La Mar and de Ropp, 1993), and for both R1p and R2p the assumption that the electron is localized on the metal ion(s) may be a problem (Wilkens et al., 1998). These issues have been analysed and assessed in previous works, so that now safe procedures are available (Bertini et al., 1996). Finally, NMR approaches have been developed to identify metal ion ligands (Bertini et al., 2001a). The latter can be used as structural constraints. The solution structure of an artificial paramagnetic molecule was solved with a wealth of constraints both classical/diamagnetic and paramagnetism-based. The protein is the mono Ce3+ substituted Calbindin D9k , which has 76 amino acids and bears two Ca2+ ions in its native state (Linse et al., 1987). The structure is well resolved, especially in the backbone part, on which the efforts were concentrated. Such a well resolved structure of a paramagnetic molecule is already a meaningful result, which we would like to pose to the attention of the scientific community. In fact, paramagnetism decreases the number and quantitative meaning of classical NOEs, especially around the metal ion, which is then compensated by the new constraints. The use of paramagnetism-based constraints on this system had already been explored by us (Allegrozzi et al., 2000). In this research, a number of diamagnetic constraints was determined by extending the whole assignment on a 13 C, 15 N-labeled sample (i) in order to obtain a very well defined structure as a starting point, and (ii) to make sure that the diamagnetic constraints were by themselves sufficient for a high resolution structure. Then, one class at a time of paramagnetism-based constraints has been neglected, to assess its contribution in the definition of the structure. Therefore, this study shows the relevance of each paramagnetism-based constraint. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the discussion on the possibility of solving solution structure of proteins without, or with a limited number, of NOEs. This is essential in the framework of high throughput structure determination aiming at the obtainment of quick, reliable information on protein scaffold.

Material and methods Sample preparation Protein expression (Brodin et al., 1986) and purification (Johansson et al., 1990) of both the Ca2+ and the apo form of the bovine Pro43Met43 (P43M) mutant (Chazin et al., 1989; Malmendal et al., 1998) of calbindin D9k was performed as reported. The expression system was a generous gift of Prof. S. Forsén. The labelling and lanthanide substitution procedure is described elsewhere (Allegrozzi et al., 2000; Bertini et al., 2001a). The pH was adjusted to 6.0 by

87 means of 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl. The samples were kept at 4  C in between measurements. Sample concentrations range from 1.5 to 2.0 mM. NMR spectroscopy Experiments were performed at 300 K and on Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 600, 700 or 800 MHz. Three-dimensional HNCA and HNCO experiments (Kay et al., 1990) were performed to assign backbone resonances. For the above experiments spectral windows of 12.8 ppm for 1 H, 28 ppm for 15 N, and 14 ppm (HNCO) or 27 ppm (HNCA) for 13 C dimensions were typically used. The number of real data points acquired were 128 or 256 in the t1 dimension (13 C), from 40 to 64 in the t2 dimension (15 N), and 1024 or 2048 in acquisition (t3 dimension). Three dimensional HNHA (Vuister and Bax, 1993), NOESY-HSQC (Kay et al., 1989), and HNHB (Archer et al., 1991) experiments were carried out to determine ,  and  dihedral angles restraints. Spectral widths of 12 ppm for both 1 H dimensions and 30 ppm for 15 N dimension were used. The number of real data points acquired were from 64 to 96 points in the 15 N dimension, from 128 to 256 in the indirect 1 H dimension, and 1024 or 2048 in acquisition (t3 dimension). The 3D NOESY-HSQC experiment was repeated at 278 K to observe the exchangeable amide protons of Gly42 and Met43. For all the above experiments, from 8 to 16 scans were collected, using a relaxation delay of 800 ms. The total time for each scan was, in all cases, ca. 2 seconds. Decoupling of 15 N nuclei during acquisition was performed using a GARP pulse sequence (Shaka et al., 1985). A 2D HNCO experiment with a 15 N-13C inept transfer delay of 66.6 ms was also acquired. This delay optimizes the coherence transfer between an amide proton and the carbonyl of a group that is making hydrogen bond with it to provide spectroscopic evidence for H-bond patterns (Cordier and Grzesiek, 1999). Two dimensional non-selective inversion-recovery 13 C and 15 N HSQC experiments were performed to measure non-selective longitudinal relaxation rates of protons (Bertini et al., 1996). In order to measure T1 values of very fast relaxing protons, all (inept transfer, acquisition and relaxation) delays were shortened. The inept transfer delays were 1.4 and 0.8 ms for 15 N and 13 C, respectively, relaxation delays were typically 500 ms. In order to measure T1 values of moderately fast relaxing protons, 13 C and 15 N non-selective IR-HSQC were collected with usual delays for inept transfer and relaxation (1/41J and 1 s, respectively). All the data were zero-filled in the indirect dimensions and apodized using cosine squared functions. All NMR data were processed with the Bruker XWINNMR software packages. The program XEASY (ETH Zürich) (Eccles et al., 1991) was used for the analysis of the NMR spectra. NMR restraints NOESY restraints The dipole-dipole restraints used in the present work are those obtained from NOESY and 1D NOE experiments for calbindin D9k in which the native calcium in site II is replaced by cerium (CaCeCb hereafter), as previously reported (Allegrozzi et al., 2000). However, the 1D NOE intensities were re-calibrated as the refinement process advanced, according to the CALIBA protocol (Güntert et al., 1991). Dihedral angle constraints The 3 JHNH coupling constants were obtained from the ratio between the intensity of the diagonal peak (1HN , 2N , 3HN ) and that of the cross peak (1H , 2N , 3HN ) integrated on 3 to 5 1 H-1 H planes in the HNHA experiment (Vuister and Bax, 1993). They were converted into constraints for the backbone torsion angle  by means of the appropriate Karplus curve (Bax and Wang, 1995). An uncertainty of ±10 was given to all angles. Among possible solutions of the Karplus equations, dihedral angle values were selected to be consistent with those found in structures obtained without the use of these constraints. For 8 3J HNH values out of 59 a range of accepted dihedral angles larger than 20 was considered. The  dihedral angles were obtained in the 15 N NOESY-HSQC experiment from the ratio (Gagne' et al., 1994): IHNH /IHNH-1 , where IHNH is the intensity of the NOESY cross-peak between an amide proton and the  proton of the same residue, and, analogously, IHNH-1 is the intensity of the same amide proton and the  proton of the precedent residue. When the value of this ratio was larger than 2.0, a  angle ranging from -65 to +5 was assumed for all residues but Ile, Thr and Ala, for which values between -65 and -15 were assumed. When the ratio was lower than 1.0, the  angle was assumed to be included in the 100 to 170 range for all residues.

88 Stereospecific assignments of methylene proton pairs were determined from 3 JHNH values. The latter were obtained from the relative intensity of the two HN -H cross-peaks in the 3D HNHB experiment (Archer et al., 1991). Relaxation rates Longitudinal relaxation rates of protons were measured from non selective inversion-recovery 13 C and 15 N HSQC experiments (Bertini et al., 1996). The intensities of the signals were plotted versus the recovery delays and fit to a mono-exponential three parameters function. The diamagnetic contribution (R1dia) was subtracted from the experimental relaxation rates obs (R1 ) according to the following expression:
obs R1 = R1dia + R1p ,

Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb) were obtained from the observed chemical shifts according to the expression: exp = dia + pcs , where dia was the chemical shift of the corresponding nucleus in the CaLaCb native protein. Pseudocontact values for 13 C atoms and side chains protons were obtained using the CaCaCb derivative as a diamagnetic analogue. The calculated pcs values were obtained by assuming the metal-center point dipole approximation, i.e., by applying Equation (1) to the corresponding nuclei. In turn, the magnetic anisotropy components as well as the orientation of the tensor was recalculated as the refinement of the structures increased, until convergence. The recalculated tensor after each refinement step was obtained using the program FANTASIA(Banci et al., 1997) by omitting the pcs values from the metal ligands as well as those from the nearby residues (57, 62­64). Hydrogen bonds When the existence of a hydrogen bond was observed in the specific HNCO experiment (Cordier and Grzesiek, 1999) (see above) the following restrictions were given: rH...O < 2.2 Å and 2.6 Å < rN...O < 3.3 Å where rH...O and rN...O are the distance of the oxygen of the hydrogen bond with the amide proton and its nitrogen nucleus, respectively. The lower distance limits were imposed to keep the linearity of the hydrogen bond. Residual dipolar coupling The rdc constraints used in the present work are those ones previously reported for the CaCeCb derivative. The procedure followed to obtain them and for their introduction as restraints in PSEUDYANA calculations have been previously reported in detail (Bertini et al., 2001d). Structure calculation The modified version of the program DYANA (Güntert et al., 1997), called PSEUDYANA (Banci et al., 1998b), which permits the simultaneous use of pcs and of rdc as constraints, was used for the structure calculations. Torsion Angle Dynamics (TAD) combined with a simulated annealing algorithm was used to calculate a family of 200 structures starting from randomly generated conformers in 10 000 annealing steps. The quality of structures calculated by

where R1dia was estimated from the average of the obs R1 values for protons far from the metal ion (for which R1p = 0). The R1dia values used in the present work were 2.0 s-1 for amide protons and 1.2 s-1 for protons bound to carbon nuclei. In turn, the obtained R1p values were plotted versus r -6 (r being the proton-metal distance) in different steps of the calculations and then converted in to lower and upper distance limits according to the following equation: R1p = K · r
-6

.

The value of K varies as the degree of resolution is increased. The final K value used was 2.6 × 10-55 s-1 m6 for both amide and aliphatic protons. Additionally, the longitudinal relaxation rates of four 13 C (Asp54 C, Asn56 C, Asp 65 C, and Val 61 C) nuclei in the CaCeCb derivative were determined and translated into upper and lower distance limits by applying the same methodology explained above. Due to the weaker effect of the hyperfine interaction on the relaxation rates of low  nuclei (Bertini et al., 2001a), only the above resonances were found to be unambiguously affected. The diamagnetic contribution was estimated to be 0.7 s-1 . Pseudocontact shifts Pseudocontact shifts are introduced as constraints in the target function of PSEUDYANA calculations as a sum of differences between the experimental and the calculated pcs for the observed nuclei in each family of structures according to the previously reported procedure (Banci et al., 1998b). The experimental pseudocontact shifts for 15 N and backbone 1 H of CaLnCb derivatives (Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Tb,

PSEUDYANA can be assessed by a properly defined function (target function) proportional to the squared deviations of the calculated constraints from the experimental ones, plus the squared van der Waals contact violations. In DYANA (and in PSEUDYANA as well), the Target Function TF has the role of a pesudo potential energy and is defined such that TF = 0 if and only if all experimental distance constraints and torsion angle constraints are fulfilled and all non-bonded atom pairs satisfy a check for the absence of steric overlap (Güntert et al., 1997). TF values are expressed in Å2 . Mean structures obtained were minimized using the program PSEUDYANA with a 1000 steps conjugate gradient minimization. The programs MOLMOL and PROCHECK were subsequently used to analyse the calculated structures.

allowed us to identify 15 amide protons and their corresponding carbonyl groups to which they are linked through hydrogen bonds. NMR constraints The number of constraints used in PSEUDYANA calculations are given in Table 1. They are grouped according to their origin in diamagnetic and paramagnetism-based constraints. The list of all the new constraints used in the present work is given in the Supplementary Material section. The diamagnetic constraints contain both short range constraints derived from NOE and 3 J coupling constants and long range constraints derived from the observation of hydrogen bonds. The NOESY constraints used in the present work (1793) are those previously reported (Allegrozzi et al., 2000), without any change in the calibration. Constraints relative to the ,  and  dihedral angles (Table 1) were obtained from the measurements of the 3 JHNH , the IHNH/IHNH-1 ratio, and the 3 JHNH values, respectively. Thirteen 1D NOE meaningful constraints (Table 1) are those used in the previous work (Allegrozzi et al., 2000), but they have been re-calibrated as the resolution of the structure was improving during the calculations. As in the case of diamagnetic constraints, the paramagnetism-based constraints contain both short range and long range constraints. The former arise

Results NMR assignment The assignment of the backbone 13 C nuclei in the CaCeCb derivative was extended, as well as that in the native CaCaCb protein, by the analysis of the HNCO and HNCA experiments. These new assignments are included in the overall assignment, which is given in the Supplementary Material section. Furthermore, an HNCO experiment performed with a 15 N-13 CO inept transfer delay of 66.6 ms (Cordier and Grzesiek, 1999)

from relaxation rates from signals in the vicinity of the paramagnetic center. Longitudinal relaxation rates corresponding to 22 protons obtained from inversion recovery HSQC experiments and 4 longitudinal relaxation times of 13 C nuclei were introduced as restraints in the structure calculations (Table 1). As far as long range paramagnetism-based constraints are concerned, 166 pcs from peptide N and NH nuclei and 156 carbon nuclei assigned for the CaCeCb derivative were also introduced as constraints, together with pcs from 969 peptide N and NH obtained from ten different CaLnCb derivatives. Finally, the rdc obtained for 64 NH pairs in the CaCeCb derivative were also included as constraints in the structure calculations. In total, as it is described in Table 1, 3880 meaningful constraints were used in the structure calculations, the diamagnetic constraints being 52.3%, versus 47.7% arising from the presence of the paramagnetic center. Solution structure calculations Structure calculations were performed with the program PSEUDYANA using the constraints shown in Table 1. The structure consists of four helices and three loops, of which the first and the third constitute the lanthanide-binding site. A stereo view of backbone atoms for the 30 conformers with lowest target function is shown in Figure 1. Such an ensemble of conformers has a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the backbone atoms of 0.25 ± 0.07 Å

in Table 2. Most of the contributions arise from long range paramagnetism-based constraints (68%). This is not surprising since PSEUDYANA (as all structure calculations programs written up to now) is thought to build the protein tertiary structures by modulating local changes, i.e., from short range constraints. The orientation of the magnetic axes and the magnitude of the main components of the magnetic susceptibility tensor for the CaCeCb derivative are similar to those already reported. In fact, the values obtained in the present work are ax = 2.10 × 10-32 m3 and rh = 0.80 × 10-32 m3 , in good agreement with those previously reported ( ax = 2.08 × 10-32 m3 and rh = 0.71 × 10-32 m3 ) (Bertini et al., 2001b). Table 3 shows the contribution to the target function of the pcs of each lanthanide ion. It is clear that the high contribution of such set of constraints to the target function is due to the CaCeCb derivative, in agreement with the fact that this derivative is the one with the highest number of constraints, including those arising from non exchangeable protons and from 13 C backbone resonances. We have analysed the effect that paramagnetismbased constraints (pcs, rdc, and relaxation rates) have both on the final resolution of the family of structures and on the overall target function. In order to do this, we have performed several PSEUDYANA runs eliminating, in each calculation, a class or part of a class of constraints. We have performed in total thirteen of these runs. In Table 4, the r.m.s.d. and target functions

(TF) of the obtained families (all of them of 30 conformers) are given. For all calculations with subsets of constraints, the r.m.s.d. of the corresponding average structure from the final average structure is given.

Discussion The effect of introducing different classes of structural constraints in a structure calculation should be considered with respect to two points: (i) the effect of the new

constraints on the accuracy and precision of the structure and (ii) the consistency with the old constraints. Comparing the structure obtained with the available diamagnetic constraints only with the final structure of Calbindin D9k , a significantly lower r.m.s.d. in the latter is observed (from 0.69 to 0.25 Å) , which is a measure of the precision of the structure. The overall consistency of the constraints can be appreciated from the fact that the r.m.s.d. decreases in the presence of paramagnetism-based constraints (empty circles in Figure 2) without increasing the target function of the diamagnetic constraints and without any increase in the number of consistent violations (only 2 consistent violations being observed with a 0.1 Å threshold). This proves that the two sets of diamagnetic and paramagnetism-based constraints are fully consistent. In the following, a series of calculations is presented where several paramagnetism-based constraints are, in turn, removed. These calculations are instructive on the intrinsic value and complementarily of these constraints. Even more importantly, calculations excluding increasing numbers of NOE constraints are also shown. The results are relevant for the general issue of how much non-NOE constraints

can substitute for NOEs in actual solution structure determinations. Inspection of Table 4 indicates that pcs are important for the final quality of the solution structure. In fact, without these constraints the global r.m.s.d. increases from 0.25 Å to 0.43 Å. Rdc constraints are also important although to a lower degree, the r.m.s.d. increasing from 0.25 Å to 0.32 Å without these constraints. As only 64 rdc values are used vs. about 1700 pcs constraints, their contribution is still remarkable. Furthermore, they improve the quality of the Ramachandran plot of the structure more than the 1738 pcs constraints, as observed in Table 4. This confirms that rdc constraints in general, and those arising from the orientation induced by a paramagnetic center in particular, are precious constraints. Figure 3 allows us to analyse in a finer detail how pcs and rdc affect the local resolution of the structure. As already discussed in previous works (Bertini et al., 2001b), the combined use of different lanthanides removes the intrinsic limitation provided by a single metal ion to act only within a spherical shell from the metal center whose inner and outer radii are metal ion dependent. The availability of different active shells for different lanthanides allows pcs to be operative all over the protein scaffold, from the region from residue

94 53 to residue 67, encompassing the Ln3+ binding loop, to the farthest residues in the linker between helices II and III. Figure 3A also shows that pcs constraints are more localized that rdc. Indeed, when rdc are excluded from calculations (Figure 3B), a higher r.m.s.d. is observed all over the molecule. Again, in regions like helix II (residues from 24 to 35) in which the structure is better defined due to dihedral angle constraints, the contribution of rdc to the overall resolution is smaller than in the loop regions. Furthermore, it seems that rdc do not simply affect the residues for which rdc are available. Indeed, even if there are no rdc constraints available for residues 55­62 (but Val 61), the exclusion of the 64 rdc constraints from calculations causes a remarkable increase of local r.m.s.d. in that region. The 26 constraints arising from T1 measurements do not, apparently, contribute to decrease the global r.m.s.d. value (Figure 3C). However, T1 constraints significantly contribute to the quality of the Ramachandran plot, providing an increase of the number of residues falling in the core region. Therefore, although the structure without T1 has the same r.m.s.d. and a slightly lower target function with respect to the structure with T1 constraints, the structure obtained including T1 constraints should be considered as the `best' structure arising from our calculations. On the other hand, T1 constraints are helpful in the absence of other paramagnetism-based constraints. As shown in Table 4, they provide a decrease of r.m.s.d. from 0.61 Å to 0.55 Å in the absence of other paramagnetism-based constraints. This is almost the same effect provided by rdc. An interesting result is observed when running PSEUDYANA with the inclusion of only certain categories of pcs constraints. Figure 4A shows the r.m.s.d. diagram obtained when only pcs arising from amide nitrogens and protons are used. It is evident that, in the regions in which a consistent set of amide pcs is available (all but residues 53­63), no substantial improvement in the quality of the structure is provided by the inclusion of 13 C and non-exchangeable protons. The latter, on the other hand, are crucial to refine the region close to the metal site, for which proton relaxation prevents the observation of 15 N-HSQC peaks. The exclusion from the calculation of one group of amide pcs constraints leads to another interesting conclusion: the structure obtained without short-range pcs (Figure 4B) is globally worse then the structure obtained without long- and medium-range pcs (Figure 4C). This is also apparent from Table 4, in terms of both global r.m.s.d. and Ramachandran plot. Consistently, the structures obtained with the exclusion of only one group of amide pcs show, as expected, worsening in different regions of the protein. The most striking worsening by the exclusion of short-range pcs (Ln = Ce, Pr, Nb, Eu, Sm) from the structure is seen in the second metal binding loop, which shows a peak in the local r.m.s.d. of above 1.2 Å. As expected, the exclusion of medium- and long-range pcs (Ln = Er, Yb, Tb, Dy, Ho, Tm) causes a less drastic increase of r.m.s.d. in the Ln3+ binding loop (Figure 4C). The sphere of action of each individual class of paramagnetism-based constraints can be further clarified by comparing the local r.m.s.d. values when one class only is inserted (Figures 5A­C). We should finally comment on the contribution provided by the identification of lanthanide-bound residues obtained by using direct detection 13 C experiments (Bertini et al., 2001a). This is the first time that these constraints are considered in the solution structure calculation of a metalloprotein. Constraints derived by metal coordination significantly reduce the local r.m.s.d. in the binding loop (Figure 5D), which decreases from a maximum value of about 2.1 Å to about 1.5 Å. Overall, their effect is quite similar to that obtained by the employment of T1 constraints although, at variance with the latter, they also contribute to the overall improvement of general statistics, as shown in Table 4. Inspection of the diagrams of the r.m.s.d. per residue for the backbone protons of the CaLnCb families, obtained with different groups of constraints, shows an interesting behavior of the Ca2+ binding loop (loop I) of the protein: while the exclusion of either pcs or rdc in two different runs leads to a modest and comparable worsening in the quality of the structure (Figures 3A and 3B) in that region, the exclusion of both groups of paramagnetism-based constraints yields a drastic increase of the r.m.s.d. per residue (Figure 5C). This demonstrates a useful complementarities of rdc and pcs constraints. It should be remembered that no assumptions have been made about the coordination of Ca2+ in the first metal binding loop. This loop is a good example of intrinsic scarcity of diamagnetic constraints due to the presence of an NMR-silent region of the protein. In Table 4 is also reported the r.m.s.d. between each average structure obtained with subsets of constraints and the average final structure. The exclusion of a subset of constraints from calculations not only leads to a family with a higher r.m.s.d., but also

bears to a mean structure different from the one obtained with all constraints. This means that a subset of constraints affects not only the precision, but also the accuracy of the final family (Zhao and Jardetzky, 1994). In fact it is implicit that, if the accuracy was not affected by the inclusion of subsets of constraints, the mean structures obtained with or without them would have been identical. The above analysis has shown that paramagnetism-based constraints are certainly valuable in structure refinement, as they show a certain degree of complementarity, and their variety (and tunability by the use of different metal ions) can be exploited to design the best experimental strategy for a given system. We address now the issue of their suitability as substitutes for NOE constraints. To do so, several calculations have been performed by retaining all paramagnetism-based constraints and by removing increasing numbers of NOEs. The results are illustrated in Figure 6. The first calculation has been performed by removing all but

long range NOEs. This decreased the total number of NOE constraints from 1793 to 244. The resulting family has target function values in the range 0.8­1.1, i.e.,

sensibly smaller than the reference solution structure family, and backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.41 Å (compared to 0.25 Å of the best structure). By removing further long range NOEs at random, the target function remains small and the backbone r.m.s.d. increases, but the quality of the structure, as judged from the r.m.s.d., remains acceptable until the NOEs are reduced to very small numbers. It is a striking result that the r.m.s.d. remains below 1 with the use of as few as 29 NOEs. The error bars in Figure 6 give an idea of the variability of the results when different sets of NOEs are randomly selected. When all NOEs are removed, however, the r.m.s.d. jumps to above 5 Å, and the family bears only a vague resemblance to the original high resolution family. r.m.s.d. values of 0.91 Å are found even when the NOEs are reduced to 7, if they are chosen to involve atoms from all the four helices in the protein. This is not surprising, since the fact that only few distances are needed to position helices with respect to each other was already known in literature, as in the case of the `heuristic refinement method' (Altman and Jardetzky, 1989; Brinkley et al., 1998). It should be recalled that, besides NOE constraints, the diamagnetic constraints include dihedral angles, which are crucial in determining the secondary structure elements (four helices in the present case). These constraints have been retained in all calculations shown in Figure 6. This choice is based on the consideration that the Chemical Shift Index

(CSI) may provide dihedral angles as well. To answer the question of their relative importance with respect to paramagnetism-based constraints in yielding a reasonable well resolved family with just 7 NOEs, the same calculations was repeated without paramagnetism-based constraints. Again, a r.m.s.d. larger than 4 Å was obtained in all cases.

Conclusions Until the present work, structures of paramagnetic proteins obtained so far showed a somewhat larger r.m.s.d. on the region encompassing the metal ion. Such a behavior depends on the balance between the loss of information due to the presence of the paramagnetic center and the gain of information due to the same paramagnetic center. We show here that advantages may effectively overcome drawbacks. This is reflected in the actual values of local r.m.s.d. Overall, the above data put into evidence how synergistic can be the role of the different contributions arising from paramagnetism. To summarize, the overall effect on the solution structure, solved with a given set of diamagnetic constraints, of the introduction of paramagnetism-based constraints for a protein containing a paramagnetic ion, is shown in Figure 7. For the first time, pcs and rdc were merged with short range information, arising from the identification of lanthanide ligands and

97 from T1 values (Bertini et al., 2001a). The increase in resolution in the close proximity of the paramagnetic center as a consequence of paramagnetism-based constraints is a well known and expected feature. On the other hand, the increase of resolution in backbone regions like the N- and C-terminal sites, usually loosely characterized, is clear from Figure 7. The resolution for the diamagnetic protein CaCaCb is of course higher than that obtained for CaCeCb (Figure 7A) by using diamagnetic constraints only. Conversely, the paramagnetism-based constraints alone produce an unresolved structure (r.m.s.d. of about 5). However, the concomitant use of paramagnetism-based constraints, angular constraints (including intra-helix hydrogen bonds) and a few long range NOEs is able to provide reasonable results (Figure 6). Since the angular constraints can be essentially obtained through the chemical shift index, a few long range constraints, which may well depend on the particular nature of the protein, provide acceptable results. The present research represents, inter alia, a hint toward solution structure determinations without NOEs.
