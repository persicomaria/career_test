Abstract An electrochemical immunosensor for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was fabricated based on anti-PSA antibody-functionalized gold colloids/alumina sol-gel film. The presence of colloidal gold provides a good microenvironment for the immobilization of biomolecules. The fabrication process of the immunosensor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. A direct electrochemical immunoassay format was employed to detect PSA on the basis of the potential change before and after the antigen­antibody interaction. Under optimal conditions, the potential change was proportional to PSA concentration ranging from 4.0 to 13 ng mL- 1 with a detection limit of 3.4 ng mL- 1. In addition, the performance and factors influencing the performance of the immunosensor were investigated and optimized. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a protein made by cells of the prostate gland, is responsible for making some of the liquid in semen [1]. When the PSA test is used for screening, it should be done along with a digital rectal exam, in which the doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland for any abnormalities [2­4]. A blood total PSA level below 4 ng mL- 1 means cancer is unlikely and levels greater than 10 ng mL- 1 mean cancer is likely [5]. The area between 4 and 10 is a gray zone. Thus, the detection of total PSA level is very helpful to clinical diagnoses. Immunoassays, with high selectivity and affinity of antibody molecules to their corresponding antigens, have widely been exploited for analytical purposes in the fields of clinical diagnoses [6­9]. Some immunoassays for PSA have been reported, such as fluorescence microscopy, surface plasmon resonance technology, immunochromatography, lateral flow immunoassay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and radioimmunoassay (RIA) [10­14].

in RIA are harmful to the operators, ELISA was extensively used for PSA detection in clinical diagnoses [15]. Chemiluminescent or fluorescent detection with ELISA, however, requires precise detection devices for miniaturized systems with a small sample volume [16]. In these regards, the electrochemical method would offer a straightforward route to in vivo monitoring the antigen­antibody interaction [17]. The sensitivity of an electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of antigens with a very low concentration can be increased by control of the orientation of antibodies immobilized on the sensor surface [18­21]. When antibodies are immobilized on a solid-phase surface, their binding activity is usually less than that of soluble antibodies [22]. One of the main reasons for this reduction of binding activity is attributed to the random orientation of the antibodies on solid-phase surface. The antibody molecule has a Y-shape, which is composed of two Fab fragments used for binding specific antigens and one Fc fragment containing antibody­effector functions [23]. When antibodies are chemically immobilized on a substrate with disordered orientation, the hidden Fab fragments result in a low degree for the antigen­antibody interaction. Protein-mediated assembly of nanoparticles is a potent tool for the creation of new materials [24]. These materials combine

tunable nanoparticle features with the unique physical and chemical properties of proteins and peptides [25]. The use of nanoparticles has enabled fabrication of protein­nanoparticle conjugates using tailored protein units as linker. Moreover, the hydrophilic, porous, and positively charged alumina sol-gel matrix provides a friendly microenvironment for antibodies [26]. The aim for the present research is to develop a fast, flexible and less-expensive immunoassay system for PSA by using gold nanoparticles and alumina sol-gel film as matrices. The detection is based on the change in the potentiometric response before and after the antigen­antibody interaction. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Reagents and apparatus Goat prostate-specific polyclonal antibody (anti-PSA) (affinity, 2 × 1010 L mol- 1) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were purchased from Zhenzhou Biocell Bioeng. Co. (China). Aluminum isoproposide (Al(i-PrO3) was bought from Shanghai Chem. Reag. Co. (China). Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 94­98%), gold chloride and tannic acid were obtained from Sigma (USA). All chemicals and solvents used were of analytical grade and were used as received. Double distilled water was used throughout this study. The PSA was stored frozen, and standard solutions were prepared daily with a phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4), which was prepared with NaCl 8.0 g, Na2HPO4 1.15 g, KH2PO4 0.2 g, KCl 0.2 g dissolved in 1000 mL water. Electrochemical measurements were performed with a CHI 730 electrochemical analyzer (CHI Co. USA). A three-electrode system comprising a prepared working electrode, a platinum wire as auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as reference was employed for all electrochemical experiments. The gold nanoparticles with different sizes were prepared via changing the concentration ratio of citrate/gold salt according to the literature [27]. The particle sizes were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (X-650, HitPSAi Instrument Co., Japan). All potentiometric and pH measurements were made with a pH meter (MP 230, Mettler-Toledo Co, Switzerland). 2.2. Preparation of alumina (Al2O3) sol-gels A typical method for the preparation of Al2O3 sol-gel (with the molar ratio of Al:H2O:HCl = 1:100:0.05) is described according to the literature [26]. Al(i-PrO3 (2 g; chemical grade) was initially added to 44.0 mL distilled water. After the mixture was stirred for 45 min at 80 °C, 1.2 mL HCl (1 M) was added. The mixture was heated to 90 °C, and the vessel was opened for 2 h to allow evaporation of the 2-propanol (i-PrOH), which was produced from hydrolysis. Afterward, the mixture was refluxed for 16 h under 90 °C. A stable and homogeneous Boemite sol (-AlOOH) was obtained. 2.3. Fabrication of the immunosensors A gold electrode (4 mm in diameter) was polished repeatedly with 0.3, 0.05 m alumina slurry, followed by successive

sonication in bi-distilled water and ethanol. Prior to the experiment, the gold electrode was cleaned with hot piranha solution (a 3:1 mixture of H2SO4 and H2O2. Cautions!) for 10 min, and then continuously scanned within the potential range from -0.3 to +1.5 V in freshly prepared deoxygenated 0.5 M H2SO4 until a voltammogram characteristic of the clean gold electrode was established. The anti-PSA/gold colloids/alumina sol-gel film was prepared by addition of 10 L anti-PSA PBS (8.5 × 10- 9 mol L- 1, pH 7.4) and 5 L colloidal gold (w/v, 5%) into 10 L stock standard alumina sol-gel. With a micropipet, aliquots (20 L) of such a homogeneous solution were dipped on the surface of the cleaned gold electrode, and allowed to gel and dry for 1 day under ambient conditions for the polymerization of the sol-gel. The modified electrode was thoroughly rinsed with doubly distilled water and equilibrated in stirred pH 7.4 PBS for at least 2 min to allow background current to diminish to a steady value. Following that, the modified electrode was incubated with 10 mg mL- 1 BSA-PBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 1 h to block the unreacted and nonspecific sites. After rinsing with PBS (pH 7.4) and water, the as-prepared immunosensor was stored in dry state at 4 °C when not in use. Fig. 1a shows the configuration of the immunosensor. 2.4. Measurement The analytical procedure for the immunosensors is schematically depicted in Fig. 1b. The detection is based on the potential change before and after the antigen­antibody interaction as the following equation: E = E2 - E1, where E1 is the value of the steady-state potential (vs. SCE) in a pH 7.4 PBS before the antigen­antibody reaction, E2 represents the value of the steady-state potential (vs. SCE) after the antigen­antibody reaction under the same conditions. The overall duration of one measurement under the final protocol of the immunoassay using the proposed electrode is about 15 min. Briefly, the assay includes the following steps: · starting-up operation, 2 min; · diluting serum sample (5-fold), 2 min; · potentiometric measurement before the antigen­antibody interaction, 3 min; · potentiometric measurement after the antigen­antibody interaction, 3 min; · regeneration, 5 min.

When the proposed immunosensor was incubated with 5 ng mL- 1 PSA for 1 h at 37 °C, the cathodic peak current decreased by only 3.9% (data not shown). Further incubation with 10 ng mL- 1 PSA, however, led to a decrease of the cathodic peak current by 73.8% (Fig. 2d). The reason may be the fact that the antigen­antibody complex acts as the inert electron and mass transfer blocking layer, and it hinders electron transfer [8]. Thus, the peak currents decreased with the increment of the PSA concentration in the sample. This phenomenon also indicated that PSA molecules could readily diffuse into the encapsulated anti-PSA. In addition, the surface coverage of anti-PSA on the sensor surface was estimated to 1.8 × 10- 8 mol cm- 3 according to Cottrell equation (i = nFACD½p-½t - ½, n: number of electrons transferred/molecule; F: Faraday's constant (96,500 C·mol- 1); A: electrode area (cm2 ); D: diffusion coefficient (cm2·s- 1); C: concentration (mol·cm- 3)). 3.2. Comparison of electrodes with and without gold nanoparticles Either antibodies or antigens in aqueous solution have a net electrical charge polarity, which is correlated to the isoelectric points of the species and the ionic composition of the solution [33]. If antibodies are immobilized on the electrode, the surface charge of the electrode will depend on the net charge of the immobilized antibody [34]. When antigen molecules are present in the solution, the immunochemical reaction will take place at the interface with a resulting change of the surface charge. This change can be measured potentiometrically against the reference electrode immersed in the same solution [35]. A comparative study of the potential responses of immunoreaction was carried out using anti-PSA immobilized on the electrodes with and without gold nanoparticles (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 3, one can find that the electrode with gold nanoparticles shows much greater in potential shift than that without gold nanoparticles. Some possible explanations may contribute to these observations. First, in contrast to the direct adsorption of antibodies on bulk gold surface, antibodies are

2.5. Statistical analysis Plasma PSA levels were measured by the proposed immunosensor and ELISA (High Sensitivity Quantikine kit, Zhengzhou, China). The ELISA detectable lower limit for PSA was 0.1 ng mL- 1 and the inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5%. The Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 10.0 for Windows was used for data analysis. Modal assumptions were tested and appropriate adjustments were made when necessary. Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean. The selectivity, repeatability, and the difference between the detection result of the proposed immunosensor and that of ELISA were analyzed with a 2 test. P b 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Electrochemical characteristics of different electrodes Fig. 2 shows cyclic voltammograms of the differently modified electrodes in a pH 7.4 PBS. As shown in Fig. 2a, there is a reduction peak at ca. + 0.05 V at bare gold electrode, which might ascribe to Au­O reduction. Seen from Fig. 2b, a decrease in the anodic and cathodic peaks was observed at antiPSA-nanogold-Al2O3 modified gold electrode. The presence of nanogold particles provides a congenial microenvironment similar to that of protein in a native system for retaining their bioactivity [28] and allow the protein molecules more freedom in orientation [29,30], and thus facilitated close approach of the protein to the sensing surface [30]. In the meantime, the formed alumina sol-gel membrane provides a three-dimensional homogenous matrix for proteins, and enhances the coverage of the proteins on the base surface. Use of bovine serum albumin, an inert protein commonly used as sealing reagent, could block the possible vacancy sites on the sensor which might induce nonspecific adsorption of other co-existing proteins [31,32]. Thus, the peak current was decreased again (Fig. 2c) after the immunosensor was incubated in bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C.

bound with well-retained bioactivities on nanogold particlemodified surfaces of high biocompatibility [36]. Second, the high surface-to-volume ratio of the assembled nanogold particles may greatly enhance the coverage of antibody on the base surface [37]. Third, the nanogold particle layer might serve as an intervening "spacer" matrix to extend the immobilized antibody away from the substrate matrix in the mobile phase, resulting in binding sites more accessible to antigens [38]. 3.3. Optimization of experimental conditions Fig. 4 shows the potential responses of the immunosensor with 8-nm, 16-nm, and 31-nm gold nanoparticles to various PSA levels, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the immunosensor fabricated with 16-nm gold nanoparticles exhibited an optimal response than that with other sizes. It is well known that the interaction between protein molecules and gold nanoparticles is very strong due to the high surface-to-volume ratio and high surface energy [39]. The larger-sized gold colloids can discontinuously assemble, however, and the smaller sized Au colloids may generate continuous arrays of particles on the base monolayer [40]. The packing of smaller-sized gold colloids

is denser than that of the larger-sized gold colloids, which provides more active binding sites for anti-PSA. The coulomb repulsion, however, becomes stronger as the size of gold nanoparticles is much smaller (as a result of the adsorption of citrate during the fabrication process) [41,42]. Thus, 16-nm gold colloids were chosen as matrix. The effect of pH of the detection solution on the performance of the immunosensor was studied between 5.5 and 8.5. As shown in Fig. 5, the optimal potentiometric response of the immunosensor was achieved at pH 7.4. The reason is that the structure and configuration of antigen/antibody were changed when pH value of supporting electrolyte is higher or lower than the isoelectric point of the antigen/antibody. Furthermore, the bioactivity of the antigen/antibody is inhibited at relatively high/or low pH. The experimental results show that the maximum response occurs at the physiological pH (7.4), which is in accordance with the observation that most immunoreactions exhibit optimal binding at this pH [34]. Therefore, a pH 7.4 PBS was used as the medium for the immunoreaction. 3.4. Regeneration of the immunosensors Regeneration of immunosensors is of interest to the immunoanalysis. Although the antibody­antigen linkage can be broken under drastic conditions (e.g. in alkalinic or acidic solutions or with chaotropic agents), the immobilized immunoreagents could also suffer from the functional damage or even be released from the immunosorbents. In this study, 0.2 M, glycine­hydrochloric acid (Gly­HCl) buffer solution (pH 2.8) was chosen to break the antigen­antibody binding. Experimental results suggested that the immunosensor kept 90.3% of the original potentiometric value after 7 assay cycles. The reason may be the fact that the extreme conditions degraded or chemically deactivated the immobilized antibody. 3.5. Analytical performance of the immunosensors For the measurement of PSA, a potentiometric measurement was applied under optimized conditions. The potentiometric

responses of the immunosensors observed, when no incubation in an analyte in the absence of PSA was performed, would be the baseline signal, since there was no conjugate for antigen binding sites. Then from the baseline signal, the standard solution of PSA at a known concentration or one serum sample was added into the incubation solution with a controlled volume ratio. The potential shift of the proposed immunosensor after the antigen­antibody reaction showed an increase with the increment of PSA concentration in the incubation solution (Fig. 6). The curve is not a linear one, as commonly observed for an immunoassay. A curve-fitting procedure could be used for the calibration graph and a pseudolinear relationship between the potential shift and the logarithm of the concentration of PSA can be fitted to the experimental points from 4.0 to 13 ng mL- 1. A detection limit (DL) of 3.4 ng mL- 1 was calculated starting from the sensitivity of the proposed sensor (DL = (3 × SD - Intercept) / Sensitivity). 3.6. Precision, reproducibility, selectivity and stability The typical intra-assay and inter-assay precision for PSA detection were also estimated by three repeated determination the same modified sensor (date not shown). The relative standard deviations (RSD) of intra-assay were 5.1% and 5.7% for 5 and 10 ng mL- 1 PSA, respectively. The RSD values for inter-assay variation were 7.2% and 5.8% for 5 and 10 ng mL- 1 PSA, respectively. Reproducibility of the immunosensors was tested by measuring 8 ng·mL- 1 PSA. RSD of normalized signals is shown in Table 1. The signals have good reproducibility, as can be observed from the RSD data. Seen from Table 1, a 10% decrease of potential response was observed after using the sensor for two weeks, which indicates fair retention of the specific binding ability of antigens and minimal microstructure changes. The slow decrease of potential response seemed to be related to the gradual deactivation of anti-PSA incorporated in the sol-gel membrane.

To investigate the selectivity of the developed immunosensor, the potentiometric response of the sensor was measured in a pH 7.4 PBS containing separately diphtheria toxoid, Troponin 2 and Digoxin. The results show that diphtheria toxoid, Troponin 2 and Digoxin below a tolerance limit in normal human serum samples do not interfere with the sensor's potentiometric response (Table 2). 3.7. Evaluation of clinical specimens with the immunosensors To investigate the possibility of the newly developed technique to be applied for clinical analysis, 20 serum specimens were examined by the developed immunoassay and the ELISA method. These results were shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that these data are tightly scatted about the calibration lines. The regression equation (linear) for these data is as follows: y = 0.424 + 0.921x (R2 = 0.963) (x-axis, by the as-prepared immunosensor; y-axis, by ELISA). These data shows that there is no significant difference between the results given by two methods which are in concordance with the results obtained using the standard methods proposed by ELISA, that is, the developed immunoassays may provide a promising alternative tool for determining PSA in human serum in clinical laboratory. In addition, a negative control experiment toward female human serum and PSA depleted human serum was carried out by using the developed immunosensor and the ELISA method. The PSA levels in female human serum and PSA depleted human serum are 2.3 and 0.9 ng mL- 1 assayed by the ELISA, respectively. However, the potential changes of the proposed immunosensor for female human serum and PSA depleted human serum are almost zero. The reason might be the fact that

the detection limit of the developed immunosensor is 3.4 ng mL- 1. Experimental results suggested that other proteins in serum sample do not significantly interfere with the response of the electrochemical immunosensor. 4. Conclusions This contribution describes an electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of PSA based on immobilization anti-PSA on nanogold/Al2O3 functionalized sol-gel thin film. PSA concentration in sample solution can be detected based on the potential change before and after the antigen­antibody interaction. The immunosensor permits a reliable determination of PSA of 4.0­13 ng mL- 1 with a detection limit of 3.4 ng mL- 1. The system was capable of carrying out all steps in less than 20 min for one sample, including incubation, washing, determination procedures, and regeneration of sensor. The developed immunoassay could be comparable with the commercial ELISA test kit. Highlights of the immunoassay system are direct, rapid and simple without multiple labeling and separation steps. However, this measurements were not possible carried out in real or undiluted serum sample because the concentration of the sample was evaluated according the following equation: E = E2 - E1.
