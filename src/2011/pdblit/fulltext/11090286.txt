A novel three-dimensional NMR experiment is reported that allows the observation of correlations between amide and other protons via residual dipolar couplings in partially oriented proteins. The experiment is designed to permit quantitative measurement of the magnitude of proton­proton residual dipolar couplings in larger molecules and at higher degree of alignments. The observed couplings contain data valuable for protein resonance assignment, local protein structure refinement, and determination of low-resolution protein folds. © 2000 Academic Press Key Words: residual dipolar coupling; protein structure; protein assignment; homonuclear decoupling.

Residual one- and two-bond heteronuclear dipolar couplings provide novel constraints for protein structure refinement in high-resolution solution NMR (1­7). These couplings are commonly measured from well-resolved scalar separated doublets. This approach is not feasible for the measurement of unresolved proton­proton residual dipolar couplings in partially oriented molecules. Recently, Tjandra et al. demonstrated that these proton­proton residual dipolar couplings can be advantageously used for protein NMR structure determination (8). Here, we present a novel method to measure such unresolved couplings quantitatively using a coherence transfer scheme that offers an alternative to earlier reports measuring such couplings that may be more difficult to quantitate or are not completely general (8 ­12). The scheme proposed is shown in Fig. 1. In the following product-operator description, only terms resulting in observable magnetization during the detection period are retained and constant multiplicative factors and relaxation terms are omitted. A three-spin system consisting of an amide proton (H), its directly bound nitrogen (N), and a generic proton (Q) coupled by dipolar (and possibly scalar) coupling to the amide proton will be considered. During the first time period T, the chemical shift evolution of Q is obtained in a constant-time fashion. Simultaneously, antiphase proton­proton magnetization, i.e.,

2Q y H z at point a is generated via residual dipolar and scalar coupling between Q and H. After transfer to the amide proton by the second proton 90° pulse (2Q z H y ) the active 1H­ 1H coupling is refocused during a second period T and simultaneously antiphase coherence 2H y N z with respect to the directly bound 15N nuclei is created ( 1 is set to 1/4J HN). Coherence H x originating on the amide proton H is also frequency labeled during the first constant time period T, and acquires antiphase coherence with respect to the directly bound N nucleus in the second period T. The two coherences of origins Q and H both follow a path of 15N chemical shift evolution during t 2 followed by the reverse INEPT to in-phase amide proton magnetization.

where indicates the residual dipolar coupling between the amide proton H and proton Q. If Q is the intra-residual 1H proton, also contains the three-bond scalar coupling. According to Eq. [1], the ratio of the intensities between the diagonal and the cross-peak yields, neglecting differences in transverse relaxation rates during t 1 , a good estimation of the residual dipolar coupling between the involved nuclei. However, because the coupling evolves with the square of the trigonometric functions, the sign of the residual dipolar coupling cannot be retrieved. Recently, Hansen et al. proposed DCOSY (9), that uses a TOCSY sequence to observe long range proton­proton correlations via residual dipolar couplings. Although DCOSY can in principle distinguish direct from relay ("spin-diffusion") crosspeaks, it is impossible to deconvolute the simultaneous contribution of these processes to a single peak. This limits the possibility of extracting quantitative information from the DCOSY experiment. More recently, Tian et al. (11) proposed a CT-COSY experiment that eliminates multiple relay peaks. In this experiment the residual dipolar couplings can, in prin1090-7807/00 $35.00 Copyright © 2000 by Academic Press All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

FIG. 1. Pulse sequence to measure residual dipolar coupling interactions between protons. Narrow and thin bars represent 90° and 180° rf pulses, respectively. Unless specified otherwise, pulse phases are along the x-axis. When working with a perdeuterated protein, or when interested only in 1H N­ 1H N residual dipolar couplings, the 1H carrier position is set to 9.2 ppm throughout the experiment and then shifted to 4.8 ppm prior to acquisition. In this case, the 180° proton pulses in the middle of the INEPT steps are REBURP pulses of 1 ms duration and 6.04 kHz peak amplitude. The pulses are designed to invert the amide proton resonances only and do not perturb the water magnetization that is consequently suppressed by the pulsed field gradients. Also, these selective pulses refocus amide proton to aliphatic proton residual dipolar couplings in protonated proteins. When working with protonated proteins where all proton­proton residual dipolar couplings are of interest, the 1H carrier is set at the water resonance except during the final INEPT transfer, and the 180° proton pulses in the middle of the two time periods-2T are nonselective. The pulsed field gradients are of 1 ms duration and strengths of g 1 30 G/cm, g 2 38 G/cm, g 3 38 G/cm. The delays are T 10 ms for YopH and 5 ms for DnaK, 1 2.6 ms. States­TPPI quadrature detection in t 1 and t 2 was achieved by 2 incrementing 1 and 2, respectively. 15N decoupling during t 1 was obtained with a 2.0 kHz WALTZ-16 decoupling sequence. The 15N resonances were decoupled from both 13C and 13CO by a WURST decoupling sequence (25) based on two CAWURST-20 shaped pulses of 10 ms duration covering 4000 Hz bandwidth each, one at the C frequency and one shifted by 24 000 Hz. WURST adiabatic homonuclear decoupling (24 ­26) was applied during acquisition for the data shown in Fig. 4. A spin lock pulse (10 s to 1 ms) prior to data acquisition was employed to improve the solvent suppression. Phase cycle: 1 2( y), 2( y); 2 x, x; 3 4( x), 4( x) rec x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x.

ciple, be obtained from the intensity ratio of the cross-peaks and diagonal. However, as the cross-peaks in their experiment have an anti-phase or phase-shifted character, they are difficult to integrate (9). The method reported by Cai et al. (12) is not completely general as it measures 1H N­ 1H couplings only. Very recently, Tjandra et al. (8) report the use of a HNHA experiment for the quantitation of 1H­ 1H dipolar couplings. The appearance, as well as information content, of their experiment is very similar to our proposed experiment. But, our experiment can be easily adapted for larger molecules by using a TROSY scheme (13­15) instead of the HSQC sequence shown. In addition, for perdeuterated protein samples, a S 3Ebased single-spin-transition selection (16) during the t 1 period can also be implemented, which will select the narrow components of the 1H N doublets in that dimension. This method was recently demonstrated by Pervushin et al. (17). As an application, we recorded the experiment with a 0.3 mM sample of 2H/ 15N/ 13C labeled Yersinia Outer Protein H (YopH, 15 kDa molecular weight) dissolved in an aqueous solution containing 6.0% DMPC/DHPC/CTAB at 3.2:1:0.1 ratio (18). With the fully deuterated sample only amide-protonto-amide-proton correlations are possible. Figure 2 shows examples of some of the observed cross-peaks, between Glu 71 and Asp 72 and between Thr 73 and Ala 74 in Fig. 2A, and the inter-strand 1H N(Ser102)­ 1H N(Asp89) connectivities in Fig. 2B. Using the assumption of identical relaxation, the observed

dipolar couplings were measured for all cross-peaks of YopH with Eq. [1], and compared with corresponding distances in the three-dimensional structure of YopH (C. Smith and M. A. Saper, personal communication) (Table 1). For YopH, the experiment shows strong cross-peaks only for protons that are separated by not more than 3.0 ­3.5 Å, with an average residual dipolar coupling of 6.3 Hz. This limited range is perhaps surprising, as it has been claimed that, because of the r 3 dependence of the residual dipolar couplings (1), proton­proton correlations via residual dipolar couplings may be exploited to cover larger distances than those obtainable via the nuclear Overhauser effect, which is a function of r 6 . However, residual dipolar couplings affect transverse magnetization only, and the transfer efficiency is severely limited by the 1H transverse relaxation time T 2H. Even for medium-sized macromolecules, this is much smaller than the longitudinal relaxation time T 1H which limits the efficiency of NOE transfer. However, for smaller molecules approaching the extreme narrowing limit, the NOE effect approaches zero, whereas the average T 2H values approach T 1H and are relatively long. In this situation we can foresee that the magnetization transfer via residual dipolar couplings can indeed provide longer-range information that may not be otherwise accessible. For our sample conditions, we observe almost exclusively sequential 1H N­ 1H N transfers for residues in helical areas of the protein (Table 1). Moreover, because of the somewhat strin-

The measurements were performed at 305 K with the sample dissolved in an aqueous solution containing 6% DMPC/DHPC/CTAB at 3.2:1:0.1 ratio. The spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA800 spectrometer operating at 800 MHz 1H frequency equipped with a triple resonance probe with a shielded z-gradient coil. Forty-two increments were recorded in the first indirect dimension and 25 in the second indirect dimension. The spectra were processed using VNMR and PROSA (27) and visualized using XEASY (28).

helical faces, as they constrain vectors that lie at various angles from the axis. Provided that the molecular alignment tensor is known from residual one-bond 1 H­ 15 N dipolar couplings (19 ­22), the 1 H­ 1 H residual dipolar couplings can be used to restrain the length and the orientation of these vectors for structure refinement. It is important to emphasize that the information derived from the dipolar coupling is free from spin-diffusion therefore representing a valuable complement to NOE-derived distance constraints, especially for intra-residue constraints. A very recent paper by Tjandra et al. (8) shows that such a structure refinement is indeed possible and useful, even for cases where the signs of the dipolar couplings are unknown.

gent angular requirements (1), only a subset of these connectivities is observed which correspond to roughly parallel vectors in these helices (Fig. 3). This observation suggests that a mere qualitative assessment of the 1H N­ 1H N couplings will be useful for the determination of low-resolution protein folds for fully deuterated proteins as follows. Together with the onebond 1H­ 15N dipolar couplings, which give information about the direction of the helix axis since they report on vectors that are all roughly parallel to that axis, the 1H N­ 1H N dipolar couplings yield valuable information on the orientation of the

demonstrated using our new sequence for a 15N/ 13C labeled sample of a 21 kDa domain of the protein chaperone DnaK (23). The observed interactions are found to occur almost exclusively between the amide proton and the side-chain protons of the same residue, as well as sequential residues (Fig. 4). Interestingly, one may therefore consider the new experiment as a useful complement to a 3D 15N-resolved NOESY experiment to aid in spin-system identification and proton side-chain resonance aasignment. In addition, the dipolar interactions contain information about the side-chain conformation. For fully protonated proteins a high degree of alignment also causes significant inhomogeneous broadening of the 1H N resonances due to numerous unresolved 1H­ 1H residual dipolar couplings. To partially eliminate this problem we have recently demonstrated that amide proton to aliphatic proton residual dipolar couplings are efficiently removed with band-selective homonuclear decoupling during data acquisition (24). Figure 4b shows the narrowing effect of such homonuclear decoupling for the current experiment which, in many cases, allows the observation of signals which otherwise did not emerge from the noise. In conclusion, we present a novel experiment that allows the quantitative measurement of proton­proton residual dipolar couplings in partially aligned proteins. The experiment can be easily combined with TROSY and homonuclear decoupling to study larger proteins at higher degree of alignments and therefore it represents a valid tool for resonance assignment, structure refinement, and determination of low-resolution protein folds.
