DEMETHYLATION OF BACTERIAL CHEMORECEPTORS IS INHIBITED BY ATTRACTANT STIMULI IN THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE REGULATORY DOMAIN OF THE DEMETHYLATING ENZYME Alain Borczuk, Ariane Staub, and Jeff Stock Department of Molecular Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540

Received October 22, 1986

The CheB methylesterase catalyzes the demethylation of membrane receptors during chemotaxis in Salmonella typhimurium. The kinetic properties of the full length product of the cheB gene are compared to those of the isolated C-terminal catalytic domain. The fragment has at least a 15-fold higher specific activity than the intact protein. In intact cells receptor demethylation is inhibited by attractants such as L-aspartate. We show here that both forms of the enzyme are similarly inhibited in vitro. Thus, the C-terminal catalytic domain of the CheB protein is sufficient for this aspect of esterase regulation. Inhibition by attractants appears to be caused by changes in receptor conformation rather than by changes in the activity of the demethylating enzyme. © 1986 Academic Press, Inc.

To address

this question,

we have compared the activity of the intact CheB protein fragment (M r = 21,000)

(M r = 37,000) with that of a C-terminal proteolytie

which completely lacks the putative regulatory domain.

In this communication

we show that the C-terminal domain is sufficient for the inhibition of demethylation which is associated with addition of attractant stimuli. effects appear to be mediated by conformational changes in the receptor These

substrate which result directly from the binding of stimulatory ligands. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials-- S-Adenosyl-L-[methyi-3H]methionine (specific activity, 13.4 Ci/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear. L-Aspartic acid, L-aspartase, and 2[N-Morpholino]ethane sulfonic acid were all obtained from Sigma. Ecoscint scintillation fluid was obtained from National Diagnostics. Other chemicals were reagent grade from standard commercial sources. Demethylation assay--The 37-kDa S. typhimurium CheB methylesterase and the derived 21-kDa C-terminal fragment were purified to homogeneity as described previously (i0). Activities were assayed using E. coii membranes containing [ H]methyl-labeled S. typhimurium aspartate receptors. These were prepared from an E. coii methyltransferase-deficient strain, containing the S. typhimurium aspartate receptor gene, tar, on a multicopy plasmid (I0). The kinetics of demethylation over intervals^ranging from a few minutes to several 5 hours were performed by adding 5 ul of [ H]membranes (approximately 0.I0 mg protein, 15000 cpm), to 0.70 ug of 21-kDa or 3.3 ug of 37-kDa CheB ~rotein in a final volume of i00 ul. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 C, and 30 ul aliquots were removed as indicated. These aliquots were immediately mixed with I0 ul of glacial acetic acid to stop the reaction. As a control to determine the total methylester content of the substrate membranes, an aliquot from each reaction mixture was placed in I0 ul of 5 M NaOH instead of acetic acid. The amount of [ H]methanol released was determined by the vapor phase equilibrium method as described previously (i0). After 12 hr of equilibration, radioactivity was assayed in a Beckman LS-230 liquid scintillation spectrometer. Demethylation kinetics over intervals ranging from a few sec to I min were measured in the same way as the slow procedure except the reactions were performed at 25°C, and samples of reaction mixture (5 ul) were removed using a Hamilton CR-700 syringe and quenched with 30 ul of 5 M acetic acid. Time points were recorded using a tape recorder. RESULTS Initial rates of [3H]methanol production were measured in the presence of the pure 37-kDa CheB protein and the 21-kDa C-terminal proteolytic of CheB (Fig. I). As shown previously fragment

FIG. 2. The effect of pH on demethylation rate for the 21-kDa and 37-kDa forms of the CheB methylesterase. Esterase reactions were performed in i00 mM sodium phosphate buffer at the indicated pH with both the 37-kDa (I, final concentration 45 ug/ml) and the 21-~Da esterase (0, final concentration, 9.0 ug/ml). In both cases, 1.0 mg/ml [-H]membranes were added to start the reaction, and the fast kinetic assay was used to determine initial rates of demethylation.

FIC. 3. The effect of aspartate on the rate of demethylation. L-Aspartate at the indicated concentrations was preincubated for I0 min at 25°C with 1.0 mg/ml [ H]membranes. The 21-kDa esterase was then added to a final concentration of 7.0 ug/ml. Using the slow kinetics protocol, 30 ul aliquots were removed at t = I, 2, and 3 min. Initial rates were determined by linear regression analyses. The inset is a double reciprocal plot of I/(~ inhibition) versus I/[aspartate]. From these data, the estimated K I of aspartate is 14 uM.

dominate during the repellent response while the latter may explain the long-term increases which are produced by attractant binding.
