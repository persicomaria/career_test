ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporters (ABC transporters) have a potential role in drug and xenobiotic resistance. Here, we report for the first time the cloning of an ABC transporter from white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (designated LvABCG), along with a study of its phylogenetic relationships, and measurements of its expression in different shrimp tissues exposed to cadmium and pH stress (acidic and alkaline conditions). Sequence analysis showed that LvABCG shares many similarities with the white/ABC transmembrane transporter, including two conserved regions: a highly conserved ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and transmembrane domain (TMD). Spatial analyses of transcript levels for ABCG in shrimp tissues, using reverse transcript PCR, revealed the highest transcript level in the hepatopancreas, less in the intestine and stomach, and none in the other tissues examined. The ABC transporter mRNA transcript in the hepatopancreas of L. vannamei was significantly up-regulated after 1.5 h and 24 h of exposure to alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. LvABCG was also induced in intestine, but was downregulated in the stomach under the alkaline treatment. Upon exposure to cadmium (4.25 µmol L- 1 and 8.5 µmol L- 1) for 48 h, the mRNA expression of LvABCG was up-regulated 4.79-fold (at 6 h) and 2.09-fold (at 12 h) in the hepatopancreas. LvABCG was also induced in the stomach after exposure to 4.25 µmol L- 1 cadmium, but downregulated in the stomach and intestine after exposure to 8.5 µmol L- 1 cadmium. These findings indicate that LvABCG might play an important role in the physiological changes related to metabolism and cell detoxification that occur when Pacific white shrimp are exposed to cadmium and pH stress. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

1. Introduction ATP-binding cassette transmembrane transporters (ABC transporters) are large, membrane-bound proteins, present in practically all living organisms from prokaryotes to mammals; their function has been identified as mediating the transport of a variety of substrates including amino acids, lipids, inorganic ions, peptides, saccharides, metals, drugs, and proteins across cellular membranes (Chen et al., 2001; Davidson, 2002; Sarkadi et al., 2006; Davidson and Maloney, 2007; Oldham et al., 2008). ABC transmembrane transporters are classified on the basis of the sequence and organization of their hydrophilic ATP-binding domains (nucleotide-binding domains, NBDs) and hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs). The ABC Transporters NBDs contain characteristic motifs, namely Walker A and B, H-loop (His-swith), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and Q-loop (phosphate linker) (Jones and George, 2002; Ward et al., 2007). Aquatic invertebrate ABC transporters play a critical role in multi Corresponding author. Tel./fax: +86 20 8521 7322. E-mail addresses: wangwn@scnu.edu.cn, weina63@yahoo.com.cn (W.-N.

xenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanisms, which are against environmental toxicants by reducing intracellular accumulation thus mitigating any potentially toxic effect (Kurelec et al., 1996; Kingtong et al., 2007). Litopenaeus vannamei is one of the most economically important species of farmed shrimp in the world; it has received increasing attention in recent years. For more than two decades, shrimp farming has suffered serious economic losses caused by infectious and noninfectious diseases and environmental pollution. Environmental stressors may have a major impact on the immune systems of shrimp and their susceptibility to pathogens (Bachere, 2000; Li and Chen, 2008). Heavy metal pollution is more common than is generally appreciated, it is a problem associated with the rapid development of industry. Most sediments of rivers in the Pearl River Delta region (one of the fastest economic growth areas in China) are seriously contaminated with cadmium, a toxic metal released into the aquatic environment by industrial sources such as mining, ore refining, and plating processes (Vido et al., 2001; Cheung et al., 2003). In the aquatic environment, metals can be transported by several processes. These are governed by the chemical nature of specific metals, sediment particles, and the pH of the surrounding environment. Cadmium is absorbed and accumulated in the tissues of aquatic organisms, altering and disrupting enzyme

activation processes, causing cell damage and even cell death and inducing oxidative stress (Sastry and Subhadra, 1982; Stohs et al., 2000; Benavides et al., 2005). The effects of pH are particularly pronounced in the Pearl River Estuary because of the problem of acid rain. Such rainfall can cause a significant drop in pH and a corresponding increase in the concentration of heavy metals in solution (Li et al., 2000; Cheung et al., 2003; Kuang et al., 2006). Environmental alkalization occurs when alkaline coal ash wastes, rich in calcium oxide, are discharged along river banks (Zanotto and Wheatly, 1993). In aquaculture ponds, a drop in pH can be exacerbated during periods of heavy rain and the pH can rise to 9.0 during red tides caused by an increase in the concentration of soluble organic substances (Wang and Wang, 1995). In addition, increases or decreases in pH also reportedly cause disturbances in the acid­base balance, ion regulation, ammonia excretion (Chen and Lee, 1997; Wood, 2001) and suppression of Na,K-ATPase activities (Wang et al., 2002) in shrimp. Human ABC transporters G subfamily (white) is involved in the translocation of steroids and lipids, which has also been identified as a multidrug transporter (Velamakanni et al., 2007). In insects, Drosophila white gene (ABC transporter) is crucial not only for eye pigmentation but also for dopamine (guanine) or serotonin (guanine and tryptophan) biosynthesis (Mackenzie et al., 1999). Shukle et al. (2008) indicated that Hessian fly ABC transporter plays a role in defense/excretion of toxic substrates. Komoto et al. (2009) showed that the white-3 gene in silkworm encodes an ABC transporter responsible for both uric acid and ommochrome precursors. Studying LvABCG will provide a better understanding of the physiological and detoxification mechanisms in white shrimp, L. vannamei. The objectives of the present study were: (1) to clone the white/ABC transmembrane transporter gene from L. vannamei, and analyze it phylogenetically; and (2) to assess the transcript levels of white/ABCG in tissues and to examine its mRNA expression response to pH and cadmium stress.

The hepatopancreas of six shrimp from each group (the challenged groups and the control group) were collected after 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h (cadmium treatment extended to 48 h); in addition, the intestine and stomach were collected after 0 h and 12 h. The organs were immediately ground in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C prior to RNA preparation. Each group was set up in triplicate.

2.2. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis Total RNA was extracted from the hepatopancreas, intestine, and stomach with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was treated with RQ1 Rnase-Free DNase (Promega, USA) to remove any DNA contamination. First-strand cDNA synthesis in RT was performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) to transcribe poly (A) RNA with oligo-d (T)18 as the primers, using total RNA from the hepatopancreas. Firststrand cDNA was generated in a 25 µL reaction volume containing 2 µg total RNA, 2× RT buffer, 10 mM dNTP, 20 µM oligo(dT18), 20 U of RNase inhibitor (Takara Dalian China) and 100 U of MMLV-reverse transcriptase; the reaction was allowed to continue for 90 min at 42 °C. 2.3. Cloning of LvABCG cDNA fragments and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) Two degenerate primers (ABC-dF and ABC-dR,) were designed, based on the conserved amino acid sequence of ABC transporters from different insects [Anopheles gambiae (AAC47423), Athalia rosae (BAD54748), Bactrocera cucurbitae (AAN38825), Drosophila melanogaster (CAA26716), and Mayetiola destructor (ABC69732)] in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, to clone the middle fragment of the LvABCG cDNA. Hepatopancreas cDNA was used as a template for amplification. PCR was performed using the primers ABC-dF and ABC-dR, with 1 cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C annealing for 30 s and 72 °C for 90 s, followed by a 5 min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were cloned into pMD-18T (Takara, China) and sequenced by the Invitrogen Corp (Shanghai, China). Rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (5, 3 RACE) of white/ABCG was accomplished using the BD SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Bioscience Clontech, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's specifications. Gene specific primers (ABC-5R1, ABC-5R2 and ABC3R1, as shown in Table 1) for 5 and 3 RACE, were designed according to the RT-PCR amplicon obtained with degenerate primers and, based on sequence analysis, found to represent a white/ABCG sequence. A full-length cDNA clone for the coding region of L. vannamei white/ABCG was recovered by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from hepatopancreas tissue. PCR primers (ABC-Fe and ABC-Re) designed for the ends of the coding region (Table 1) were used to amplify the cDNA sequence. 2.4. Phylogenetic analysis of LvABCG After determining its full length, the sequence was compared with other sequences available in the NCBI database and sequence similarities were analyzed using the NCBI BLAST algorithm (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The open reading frame of LvABCG was predicted through an EditSeq program (DNAstar Inc. US) and motif prediction was carried out using ExPASy (http://www.au. expasy.org). Topology prediction of membrane proteins was conduct at TopPred [available at EBI], based on G. von Heijne algorithm. Pairwise and multiple alignments of the LvABCG were performed using the ClustalW multiple alignment program. MegAlign (DNAstar Inc. US) was used to produce the phylogenetic tree based on the neighbor-joining (NJ) method.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Animal maintenance, pH and cadmium stress Shrimp (L. vannamei), averaging 8.76 ± 0.39 cm body length and 4.85 ± 0.58 g body mass, were obtained from a local shrimp farm in Nanhai (Guangdong, China) and acclimatized in saltwater tanks (5 m3) for 1 week before treatment. The saltwater salinity was 10 and the temperature was 22 ± 1 °C throughout the experiments; the water was aerated continuously using an air stone. L. vannamei were fed with commercial shrimp feed twice per day and feeding was stopped 24 h before treatment. In order to assess the effects of pH on the shrimp and their ABCG, 12 plastic aquaria (50 × 35 × 30 cm, water volume 52 L) containing 10 saltwater (pH 7.4) were prepared, and approximately 40 shrimps were placed in each aquarium. The pH was then raised to pH 9.3 in six aquaria by the gradual addition of 1 mol/L each of Na2CO3 and NaHCO3, and reduced to pH 5.6 in another set of six by adding 1 mol/L HCl. Shrimp exposed to pH 7.4 were set as control group. Over the following day the pH was monitored, using a 228573-A01 pH electrode (Orion Research Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) attached to an Orion320 pH meter (Zhou et al., 2008), and the shrimps' survival rates were monitored in each set of aquaria; sample groups of shrimps were harvested for the ABCG profiling at various times, as described in the following sections. For the assessment the effects of cadmium on the shrimp and their ABCG, we examined three cadmium-exposure levels (0, 4.25 and 8.50 µmol L- 1 cadmium2+), each replicated three times. The cadmium tests were conducted according to our previous study (Chang et al., 2009). Test solutions were prepared, immediately prior to use, with culture media from stocks made with Cd Cl2 2.5H2O (analytical grade, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in deionized water.

2.5. Tissue expression analysis To study the tissue-specific expression of LvABCG in the absence of stress, tissues, including hemocytes, hepatopancreas, intestine, stomach, heart, gill and muscle, were collected from six untreated individuals. The expression of LvABCG in tissues was examined using RT-PCR. A sample of total RNA at 2 µg from tissues was reverse transcribed with oligo-d (T)18. Two specific primers, ABC-Fc and ABCRc were used to amplify a 307 bp ABCG fragment, and the primers Actin-Fc and Actin-Rc were used to amplify the -actin fragment (637 bp) that was used as a positive control. PCR was performed under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C/ABCG or 58 °C/-actin for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min) and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels. 2.6. Quantitative real-time PCR assay after exposure to pH and cadmium stress Total RNA samples were prepared from the hepatopancreas, stomach and intestine of shrimp. Subsequently, first strand cDNA was synthesized as described above and stored at -20°C until it was used for realtime-PCR. mRNA expression of the target gene in different tissues was measured by qPCR. The specific primers were designed on the basis of published L. vannamei mRNA [Genbank accession nos. FJ710168 (LvABCG) and AF300705 (-actin)] using Primer Premier 5 (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA) shown in Table 1. The qRT-PCR amplifications were carried out in a total volume of 20 µL containing 10 µL 2 × SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Dalian China), 5 µL cDNA (2:5 diluted with PCR-grade water), 0.2 µL each of 20 µM forward and reverse primer, 0.4 µL ROX and 4.2 µL PCR-grade water. Real-time PCR was carried out using an ABI7300 real-time PCR machine (Applied Biosystem Foster City, CA, USA). The -actin and LvABCG Realtime PCR primers are listed in Table 1. PCR amplification was performed in triplicate wells, under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 31 s. Melting curve analysis of the amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR reaction to confirm that only one PCR product had been amplified and detected. The two groups were analyzed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the relative fold of the expression of the -actin gene with the 2- CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The statistical analysis was based on comparisons of the relative expression ratio of the LvABCG gene to the -actin gene between the control and stressed groups by calculating 2- CT. Quantitative data were expressed as means ± SD (standard deviation) representing relative expression ratio. Statistical differences were estimated by two-way ANOVA followed by Duncan's multiple range tests; the significance level was set at P b 0.05. All statistics were performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).

3. Results 3.1. Cloning and sequence analysis of a cDNA encoding LvABCG Because of our ongoing interest in revealing the functional genomics of detoxification in shrimp exposed to a toxic environment, we cloned and characterized a putative ortholog of the Mayetiola destructor white/ABC-active-transporter gene encoding an ABC transmembrane transporter protein from L. vannamei. The LvABCG full-length cDNA consisted of 2161 bp with an ORF of 1911 bp. It exhibited a polyadenylation signal with a poly (A) tail sequence (Fig. 1). The ORF is capable of encoding a polypeptide of 637 amino acids (aa) with an estimated molecular mass of 70.8 kDa and a predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 8.28. The deduced aa sequence of LvABCG was compared with several ABC transporter and white proteins from other species that were available in GenBank. The LvABCG cDNA sequence was submitted to the NCBI GenBank under accession number FJ710168. A BLAST (blastp) search on the NCBI website using the deduced amino acid sequence for the putative white/ABCG sequence from L. vannamei revealed that LvABCG had the highest similarity (66%) and identity (48%) to Tribolium castaneum white/ABC transporter (NP001034521) (E-value, 2e-162), and shared 53­66% similarity to other known white/ABC transporter sequences. Compared to other scarlet/ATP-binding-cassette proteins, LvABCG deduced amino acid sequence had 52­56% similarity. A conserved domain search of the NCBI database and application of the program patmatmotifs in EMBOSS identified LvABCG is a `reverse' transporter, with conserved ATP-binding domains (Ewart et al., 1994; Zwiebel et al., 1995) in the NH2-terminal region, namely Walker A, Walker B, and the ABC transporter signature motifs (Fig. 1). In addition, six putative a-helical transmembrane segments similar to those in the medfly (C. capitata) (Zwiebel et al., 1995) were identified in the COOH-terminal region.

3.2. Phylogenetic analysis of LvWhite/ABCG A phylogenetic tree, based on the deduced amino acid sequences from the different white/ABC transporters of 11 known species (including zebrafish) and scarlet protein from six known species, was created using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method to determine the position of the LvABCG in an evolutionary context. Phylogenetic analysis showed that shrimp ABC transporter and white proteins from the other insects, were grouped into one cluster (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the deduced amino acid of shrimp white/ABCG has a high specificity with ABCG-EDPR, but not with Drosophila white and Hessian fly white after blast on NCBI.

3.3. Tissue expression of shrimp white/ABC transmembrane transporter Tissue expression of white/ABC transmembrane transporter mRNA was examined by reverse transcript RT-PCR (Fig. 3). -actin was used as an internal control. The shrimp white/ABCG gene was expressed significantly more in the hepatopancreas than in any of the other tissues examined; expression was lower in the intestine and weak in stomach, and no signal was detected in the other tissues examined from L. vannamei (Fig. 3).

3.4. White/ABCG mRNA expression after exposure to pH and cadmium stress Gene expression of white/ABCG in L. vannamei hepatopancreas, stomach and intestine after exposure to pH and cadmium stress was examined using quantitative real-time PCR. At pH 5.6, the white/ABCG transcript level in the hepatopancreas showed a significant increase from 12 h onwards, continuing to increase up to 24 h after the stress was applied (Fig. 4A). No significant

change in white/ABCG transcription was detected in the stomach or intestine after exposure to acidic conditions (Fig. 4B&C). The gene expression of white/ABCG in the hepatopancreas increased sharply during the first 1.5 h after exposure to alkaline conditions, and had decreased to the original level after 3 h; it then increased gradually again to 12 h, but returned to its original level 24 h after the stress was applied. L. vannamei white/ABCG was also induced under alkaline conditions in the same way in the intestine; in the stomach, however, the pattern of expression was reversed. Exposure to 8.5 µmol L- 1 cadmium for 3 h resulted in the gene expression of white/ABCG in shrimp hepatopancreas increasing significantly; it reached its highest level after 12 h, but returned to the original level 24 h after the stress was applied. The transcript level of white/ABCG increased significantly after 6 h of exposure to 4.25 µmol L- 1 cadmium and returned to its original level after this time (Fig. 5A). White/ABCG was Suau and L pezalso induced in the stomach after exposure to 4.25 µmol L- 1 cadmium, but was downregulated in the stomach and intestine after exposure to 8.5 µmol L- 1 cadmium (Fig. 5B&C). 4. Discussion In this study, a full-length cDNA sequence of the white/ABC transmembrane transporter was successfully cloned from white shrimp, vannamei. To our knowledge, this is the first full-length cDNA sequence of white/ABCG cloned from a crustacean. Several typical conserved structural domains of eukaryotic ABC transmembrane transporter, such as the Walker A, Walker B, Q-loop, H-loop, (nucleotide-binding domains NBDs) and the transmembrane domain, were identified in the ABC transporter. These domains are essential for the functioning of ABCG in the transfer of energy to transport substrates across the membrane and provide specificity for each substrate (Dean et al., 2001a,b; Ward et al., 2007). ABC signature is the hallmark of the ABC transporter superfamily and is found between the Walker A and Walker B (Dean et al., 2001a,b). The strong conservation of ABC signature in evolution implies an important role. However, its functional significance is still not well understood (Frelet and Klein, 2006). Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of LvABCG showed high conservation to the white/ABC transmembrane transporter of Tribolium castaneum, Drosophila melanogaster, Bombyx mori, Mayetiola destructor and other species. The Drosophila white gene is a homologue of the human ABCG (white) subfamily gene, which also contains an NBF at the N terminus and a transmembrane domain at the C terminus (Klucken et al., 2000). Compared to full ABC transporter proteins such as Pglycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug/xenobiotic resistance (MRPs) transporters, which are typically composed of two transmembrane domains and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains, ABCG (white) genes are often referred to as `half transporters' and are thought to form homodimers. Many studies have revealed that ABCG (white) protein functions as a xenobiotic transporter which may play a major role in multidrug resistance (Ozvegy et al., 2002; Ejendal and Hrycyna, 2002; Sarkadi et al., 2006). It probably also serves as a cellular defense mechanism in response to mitoxantrone and anthracycline exposure

(Miyake et al.,1999; Ross et al.,1999). Recently it has been demonstrated that it transports organic anions as well as steroids (cholesterol, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone) and certain chlorophyll metabolites (Nakatomi et al., 2001; Eisenblätter and Galla, 2002; Janvilisri et al., 2003).

Conservation of the ABC transporter subfamily domain structure in the putative shrimp white/ABCG protein was reflected in the highly significant degree of similarity (62­66%) to white/ABC transporter

proteins from insects. The deduced amino acid sequence also showed similarities (52­56%) to scarlet proteins from insects, but at a significantly lower level than to the white/ABC transporter proteins. Furthermore, phylogeny analysis grouped the deduced amino acid sequence of the shrimp white/ABCG gene with the white/ABC transporter proteins from insects, while scarlet proteins were grouped in a separate cluster, thus providing additional support that the L. vannamei white/ ABCG gene encodes an ABC transmembrane transporter protein. The molecular characteristics of LvABCG suggested that it might play a very important role in detoxification, as has been reported in other organisms (Shukle et al., 2008). When studying the distribution of LvABCG in different tissues, it has been found to be very strongly expressed in the hepatopancreas, a detoxification tissue, which is regarded as a key metabolic centre involved in both the synthesis of digestive enzymes and the detoxification of xenobiotics (Gibson and Barker, 1979; Vogt, 1994). In animals, cadmium was shown to be toxic to all tissues. Cadmium exposure causes morphological and functional damage in hepatic (Dehn et al., 2004), and gastrointestinal tract (Weisman, 1998). Cadmium was also shown to alter the hepatic microsomal drug metabolism (Uetani et al., 2006). Several studies have shown that cadmium provokes generation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage (Sarkar et al., 1998; Waisberg et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2009). The various toxic effects induced by cadmium maybe due to increased lipid peroxidation (generated by oxidative stress) (Sarkar et al., 1998; Calderoni et al., 2005). It has also been reported that acid and alkaline exposure will cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which will cause lipid peroxidation and ROS-induced double strand breaks DNA damage (Zhang et al., 2008; Selivanov et al., 2008). Stressed cells will secrete higher amounts of cytokines and several oxidized lipid mediators (e.g. eicosanoids and platelet activator factor) which contribute to tissue damage (Rosenfeld, 1998; Reilly et al., 1998).Cellular homeostasis also requires inactivation and elimination of endogenous signaling molecules (such as steroids), and defense against these endogenously generated toxicants such as lipid peroxides and heme degradation products (Goldstone et al., 2006). ABC transporters or multidrug efflux transporters act as the first line of cellular defense against amphipathic or slightly lipophilic compounds (Dean et al., 2001a,b). ABC transporters not only transport a variety of substrates into and out of the cell, but also involved in intracellular compartmental transport (Stefkova et al., 2004). The mammalian ABCG1 is involved in the transport of cholesterol and phospholipids (Croop et al., 1997). The human ABCG2 protein has been associated with drug resistance (Dean et al., 2001a,b) which suggests that these insect transporters could have a similar detoxification role. ABCG5 and ABCG8 have been identified that involved in lipid transport (Hubácek et al., 2001; Velamakanni et al., 2007). When shrimp were exposed to acidic conditions, the expression of LvABCG was up-regulated after 12 and 24 h compared with that of the control group, whilst in alkaline conditions the transcription of LvABCG was induced at 1.5, 6 and 12 h but returned to the normal level at 24 h after stress was applied. The transcript level of ferritin reaches its peak after the first 1.5 h at pH 9.3 and returns to the original level after 24 h (Zhou et al., 2008). We have also found the antioxidant enzyme genes manganese superoxide dismutase (cMnSOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and thioredoxin upregulated in shrimp hepatopancreas after exposure to pH stress (Wang et al., 2009). An important detoxification enzyme, glutathione transferase (GST), was also highly expressed in shrimp hepatopancreas when exposed to pH stress (Zhou et al., 2009). Shrimp exposure to pH stress for 12 h results in significant DNA damage in the hepatopancreas, however the DNA strand damage is significantly greater at pH 9.3 than at pH 5.6 (Wang et al., 2009). We, therefore, infer that the induction of antioxidant enzyme genes or detoxification enzyme genes (GST, ABC transporter) may reduce tissue damage in white shrimp in acidic and alkaline environments.

Different expression profiles of LvABCG were obtained when shrimp were exposed to cadmium. After 6 h exposure to 4.25 µmol L- 1 cadmium2+, the expression of LvABCG in the hepatopancreas of shrimp was up-regulated compared with that of the control group at the same time. Meanwhile, it exhibited up-regulation at 3 and 12 h when exposed to 8.5 µmol L- 1 cadmium2+ compared with that of the control. In our previous study, cadmium was also found to induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in shrimp hepatopancreas. DNA damage in the hepatopancreas was significantly higher after 6 h exposure to 4.25 and 8.5 µmol L- 1 cadmium2+ than in the control (Chang et al., 2009). Huls et al. (2009) reviewed the important role that ABC transporters play in tissue defense; the function may be to protect the cells by pumping out toxicants and harmful products of oxidative stress. ABC transmembrane transporter protein is induced by exposure to toxins, supporting the suggestion that a major role of this protein is in the first line of defense against xenobiotics by reducing accumulation of toxins in cells (Sarkadi et al., 2006). The high expression of LvABCG in the hepatopancreas after pH and cadmium stress suggests that this protein might be involved in extruding toxic chemicals and harmful products of oxidative stress. It is proposed that up-regulation of LvABCG could protect shrimp hepatopancreas cells from the cytotoxic effects of toxic substrates generated endogenously under acidic/alkaline pH conditions and in environments containing toxic heavy metals.
