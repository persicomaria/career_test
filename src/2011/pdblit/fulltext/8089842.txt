A Protein Structure from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data
ZacRepressor Headpiece
A procedure is described to determine the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules from nuclear magnetic resonance data. This procedure combines model building with a restrained molecular dynamics algorithm, in which distance information from nuclear Overhauser effects is incorporated in the form of pseudo potentials. The method has been applied to the N-terminal DNA-binding domain or headpiece (amino acid residues 1 to 51) of the lac repressor from Escherichia coli, for which no crystal structure is available. The relative orientation of the three helices of the headpiece is similar to that of the three homologous helices found in the c1 repressor of bacteriophage ;1.

The development of two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance methods (Aue et al., 1976; Nagayama, 1981; Bax, 1982) has made it possible to assign the majority of resonances in `H n.m.r.t spectra of biological macromolecules with molecular weights up to approximately 10,000 (Wiithrich et al., 1982; Billeter et al., 1982; Wagner & Wiithrich, 1982). With these assignments, a large number of nuclear Overhauser effects can be identified between individual protons in the macromolecule via so-called 2D NOE or NOESY spectra (Jeener et al., 1979; Macura & Ernst, 1980). Since the NOES contain information on proton-proton distances and since, in principle, the three-dimensional structure can be derived from a sufficient number of dist'ances, this has changed dramatically the prospect of determining the spatial structures of biomolecules in solution by n.m.r. However, even when a large number of NOES is known, for instance, for a protein, the actual determination of its three-dimensional structure is by no means a t,rivial matter. Here we present a new approach to this problem. With respect to previously proposed methods (Braun et al., 1983), new elements in our procedure include a model-building step making explicit use of secondary structure information and a refinement procedure using a restrained MD algorithm, in which the NOE information is incorporated in the form of pseudo potentials. The procedure has been used to determine the spatial domain (or structure of the DNA-binding headpiece) of the Eat repressor, for which no crystal structure is available. Although thus far only a "low resolution" structure has been obtained, some inferences on the mode of DNA binding of the headpiece can be made. Both the secondary and tertiary structure of the headpiece are homologous

to those of part of the cI repressor of bacteriophage I, although the sequence homology extends to only six amino acid residues. The protocol that we used for protein structure determination on the basis of n.m.r. data is shown in Scheme 1. It was applied to the N-terminal domain, consisting of amino acid residues 1 to 51, of the Escherichia coli lac repressor. This headpiece is held responsible for the sequence-specific DNAbinding property of the repressor. We have reported on the proton n.m.r. assignments (Zuiderweg et al., 1983a; step 1) of the headpiece, obtained by the elegant sequential resonance assignment procedure developed by Wagner & Wiithrich (1982). With some recent additions (E. R. P. Zuiderweg & R. Kaptein, unpublished results), we have now assignments for all backbone amide and C, protons except those of Ile48. Moreover, complete spin systems for 38 residues were identified and assigned to specific amino acid side-chains. Direct interproton NOES (step 2) are defined by cross peaks in 2D NOE spectra taken with a mixing time (50 ms) short enough to prevent spin diffusion. In these spectra, cross peaks between C, protons of residue i and amide protons of both residue i+ 1 and i+ 3 were just visible for a-helical residues (see below). Since the corresponding distances between these protons are 3.5 a in regular a-helices, we have defined a cutoff distance of 3.5 A for all proton pairs that give rise t,o cross peaks in the 2D NOE spectrum with 50 ms mixing time (a more detailed discussion of t'his procedure will be given elsewhere, E. R. P. Zuiderweg & R. Kaptein, unpublished results).

et al distance constraints {r$}. For this pseudo potential. we chose the following form: 3 Kdrij-4))' if rij > rz if rij I rz i0 Thus, if t,he distance rij between atoms i and i satisfies the NOE constraint. the additional potential energy term is equal to zero. However, if the distance is larger, the term V,, will try to reduce it. The value of the force constant K,, was taken such t'hat Vd:d, fkT at 3OOK, when rij exceeds r: = by 1 A. This allows for thermal fluctuations of the order of 1 A in excess of the NOE distances. Only for amide-amide NOES could r$ be set equal to the NOE cut-off distance of 3.5 8. In most cases. however, corrections had to be added: first, because the MD treated CH, CH, and CH, groups as united atoms. Secondly, incomplete knowledge about assignments (e.g. methylene protons and most methyl groups of valine and leucine residues could be assigned only pairwise) and dynamic processes such as methyl group rotations and tyrosine ring flips int'roduce further uncertainties which, for instance, for a NOE between non-specifically assigned methyl groups of two valyl residues would lead t,o rt. = 7.7 A. Some results of the structure refinement based on 159 NOE constraints are given in Table 2, and the resulting structure after a 25 ps restrained MD run is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen from Table 2 t,hat, the MD routine is far more efficient than the EM procedure in reducing the distance constraint violations. It also reduces the energy E,,, to a value that' is reasonable for a protein of this size. There are still 12 distances larger than the NOE constraints in t,he 25 ps structure, mostly those involving \?a130 in the loop region between helices II and III, and the conformation of the loop is therefore ill-defined (the possibilitv of multiple conformations of the loop in solution cannot be excluded). We envisage furt,her improvements by cycling through steps 1 and 5, changing t,hr conformation manually when it is trapped in false minima. Nevertheless, the overall folding of the headpiece should be well-established. v,, =

Thus, a set, of 159 NOES was obtained t,hat, may for t'he spatial serve as distance constraints structure of the molecule. This set includes 32 short range NOES (between adjacent residues). 25 medium range (between residues less than 5 apart in the sequence) and 102 long range NOES. The short and medium range NOES constrain the secondary structure (step 3). From these NOES, it was concluded (Zuiderweg et al., 1983b) that the headpiece contains three cr-helices at t'he sequence locations 6-l 3 (helix I), 17-25 (helix II) and 34-45 (helix III) connected by a short, t,urn bet,ween helices I and II and a loop region with irregular structure between helices II and III. In step 4, a molecular model was built using the three helices as building blocks. Since many NOES are observed between helical residues (see Table 1). t.he relative orientation of these helices could be determined in a unique way (Zuiderweg et al.. 1984). This leads t,o a crude struct,ure of the headpiece which, after measurement of the atomic co-ordinates, was subjected t,o refinement. Here, we are concerned mainly with this refinement stage 5. which consists of two parts. First, the strain in the molecule. due to errors in co-ordinate measurements, was relaxed by a steepest descent' energy minimization procedure. The st'ructure was refined further using a restrained molecular dynamics routine (van Gunsteren & Berendsen, 1982). Tn both the EM and MD calculations, t,he potential energy function cont.ained the usual contributions for bonded atoms (bond angles and dihedral angles. bond lengths were kept rigid) and non-bonded atoms (Lennard-Jones, Coulomb: van Gunsteren & Berendsen, 1982). In addition, a term was added in order to let the molecule sat'isfy the set of NOE

a protein structure using the method proposed in Scheme 1, and it is clear that many questions remain to be solved. Thus, the range of convergence of the MD routine to the and the sensitivity starting structure and to different weights of the NOE potentials with respect to the other energy terms needs to be established. The dynamic information present in the MD runs could be used to reinterpret the NOE data in terms of local correlation time and time-averaging effects. Finally, general criteria need to be developed for judging the quality of the structure obtained similar to what has been done in X-ray crystallography.

Advancement of Pure Research (ZWO).

Figure 1. C, carbon drawing of the structure of lac repressor headpiece as determined from NOE data. The headpiece has a hydrophobic core formed by apolar residues from all three helices. As evidenced by the multiple NOES involving these residues (Table l), Va19, Va120, Va123, Va124, Leu6, Leu45, AlalO, Ala41, Met42 and Tyr47 belong to this hydrophobic region. Most polar residues are found at the surface of the molecule. The present. structure allows a molecular interpretation of some of the genetic data available for the repressor (Miller et al., 1979). Thus, mutant repressors with amino acid substitutions for Tyr17 and Gln18 lose operator binding rapacity (i- mutants). Since these residues are found at the exterior of the molecule (in the "recognition helix" II), it is likely that they are involved directly in DNA binding. By contrast, probably an i- mutant with Tyr47 substituted cannot form a folded headpiece domain, in view of the st,ructural role observed for this residue. The relative orientation of helices I and II is similar to that found in other DNA-binding proteins, such as CAP (Weber et al., 1982) and cro (Matthews et al., 1982) and c1 (Sauer et al., 1982) repressors, for which crystal structures are available. Moreover. the tertiary structure of the headpiece is quite homologous to the central part of t'he c1 repressor (helices 2, 3 and 4). in spite of the fact that only six amino acid residues are identical (Lewis et al., 1983). Finally, the structure is entirely compatible wit'h recent photo-CIDNP data (Buck et al., 1980). Tyr7, Tyrl2. Tyrl7 and His29 in the free headpiece are accessible to a photo-excit,ed dye, while Tyr47 is not. In the presence of DNA, only Tyrl2 remains accessible. This identifies one side of t,he molecule (the front. in Fig. I) with residues from helices I and II: and the loop as the DNA-binding sit)e, while the side-chain of Tyrl2 indeed points backward. Work is in progress aimed at further refinement of the headpiece structure and characterization of its mode of binding with la,c operator DNA. We have described the first attempt to determine
