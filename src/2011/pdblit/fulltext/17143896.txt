ABSTRACT The Escherichia coli MnmE protein is a 50-kDa multidomain GTPase involved in tRNA modification. Its homologues in eukaryotes are crucial for mitochondrial respiration and, thus, it is thought that the human protein might be involved in mitochondrial diseases. Unlike Ras, MnmE shows a high intrinsic GTPase activity and requires effective GTP hydrolysis, and not simply GTP binding, to be functionally active. The isolated MnmE G-domain (165 residues) conserves the GTPase activity of the entire protein, suggesting that it contains the catalytic residues for GTP hydrolysis. To explore the GTP hydrolysis mechanism of MnmE, we analyzed the effect of low pH on binding and hydrolysis of GTP, as well as on the formation of a MnmE transition state mimic. GTP hydrolysis by MnmE, but not GTP binding or formation of a complex with mant-GDP and aluminium fluoride, is impaired at acidic pH, suggesting that the chemistry of the transition state mimic is different to that of the true transition state, and that some residue(s), critical for GTP hydrolysis, is severely affected by low pH. We use a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based approach to get insights into the MnmE structure and properties. The combined use of NMR restraints and homology structural information allowed the determination of the MnmE G-domain structure in its free form. Chemical shift structure-based prediction provided a good basis for structure refinement and validation. Our data support that MnmE, unlike other GTPases, does not use an arginine finger to drive catalysis, although Arg252 may play a role in stabilization of the transition state.

ficking, signal transduction, and cell cycle control.1,2 The common property shared by these proteins is the presence of a structural module, the G-domain, which is involved in the switching of the protein between a GTPbound and a GDP-bound conformation. This conformational switch determines the active state of the protein and, therefore, is crucial for its function. The G-domain typically comprises a central b-sheet flanked by a-helices. Five polypeptide loops form the guanine nucleotide-binding fold and contain the most highly conserved motifs in this domain that define the G protein superfamily. These motifs (G1­G5) are invariably involved in binding of guanine nucleotides and the important cofactor Mg2þ, hydrolysis of GTP, or controlling the conformational change, which is primarily confined to two highly flexible regions called switches I and II that include the G2 and G3 motifs, respectively. Each GTPase specifically binds and hydrolyses GTP in a cyclic mechanism that activates and deactivates the GTPase protein. Ras-related proteins are in active state when GTP-bound; the binding of GTP causes a conformational change in these proteins that allows interaction with a target molecule or effector; this interaction is

finished by hydrolysis of protein-bound GTP to GDP, which should be released from the inactive GTPase to allow new entry of GTP. The GTPase cycle of Ras requires participation of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (which catalyze the hydrolysis step and the release of bound GDP, respectively), since these GTPases typically show a very low intrinsic hydrolase activity and a very high affinity for guanine nucleotides. In most members of Ras family, GAPs stabilize the transition state of the reaction by supplying a so-called arginine finger and enhancing the stability of amino acids located in switches I and II.3­6 A glutamine adjacent to G3 is also crucial to stabilize the transition state and orient the attacking water molecule. In Ga subunits of trimeric G proteins, the catalytic invariant arginine is provided in cis from a helical domain of the GTPase polypeptide, inserted just before the G2 motif, meanwhile the corresponding GAPs (called regulators of G protein signaling) do not contribute any residue to the catalytic machinery but stabilize the active conformation.6 Escherichia coli mnmE gene product (EcMnmE) is a 50-kDa multidomain protein involved in tRNA modification, whose middle G-domain is about 165 residues. Unlike proteins from Ras and translation factor families, MnmE exhibits a high intrinsic GTPase hydrolysis rate and low affinity for GTP and GDP; these peculiar biochemical properties determine that the GTPase cycle of MnmE proceeds efficiently, in vitro, without auxiliary factors.7 Mutational analyses have indicated that the GTPase domain is essential for the MnmE tRNA modifying function, which requires effective hydrolysis of GTP, and not simply GTP binding.8,9 The mitochondrial MSS1 and GTPBP3 proteins are the MnmE homologues in yeast and human, respectively. The MSS1 mutants are defective in mitochondrial tRNA modification, which associates with respiratory defects.10,11 Several recent works strongly suggest that lack of modification is a major causative factor of human mitochondrial diseases associated with specific mitochondrial tRNA mutations,12­15 which has led to the hypothesis that defects in tRNA-modifying proteins may play some role in human mitochondrial diseases.9 Strikingly, the isolated G-domain of E. coli MnmE roughly conserves the guanine nucleotide binding and GTPase activities of the intact MnmE molecule,7 which suggests that removal of the N- and C-terminal regions should not substantially affect its tertiary structure, and that the MnmE G-domain contains the catalytic residues that explain for the high intrinsic GTPase activity of the entire protein. At present, the molecular bases of the peculiar biochemical properties of MnmE or its G-domain are unknown. In this respect, the investigation of the pH dependence of the intrinsic GTPase activity of MnmE may provide some clues on the role of protonation in its catalytic mechanism. Experimental three-dimensional structure of either E. coli MnmE or its G-domain may also help to understand the basis of its intrinsic catalytic activity. Unfortunately, E. coli MnmE did not provide crystals of

the required quality for X-ray diffraction structure determination16 and whole length protein exceeds the size suitable for structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. The solubility of the truncated 17 kDa segment of the E. coli MnmE G-domain is extremely reduced and its stability with respect to pH and temperature conditions is very limited with respect to NMR spectroscopy needs. All these adverse factors make high-resolution experimental structure determination extremely challenging. A common alternative to experimental procedures for structure determination is homology modeling threedimensional structure prediction. Sequence identity scores with respect to other GTPase domains with known three-dimensional structure are in the valid range for structural homology prediction methods.17 Several structures have been reported for GTPase proteins in the Ras family. Therefore, structural information for conserved regions in the amino acid sequence is available and can be translated to the MnmE G-domain amino acid sequence to generate a homology model. To improve overall quality and reliability of such a model, NMR experimental data can be included at different stages of the calculations.18,19 Moreover, the obtained structures can be validated by chemical shift prediction algorithms. Finally, chemical shift prediction may be used for the selection of best models from different templates as an experimental criterion to detect higher structural homology levels. In this work, we present a model for the G-domain of EcMnmE obtained by NMR data and translation of structural information from several templates. Both experimental and theoretically derived restraints have been used in restrained molecular dynamics simulated annealing for obtaining and refinement of the model. Overall, our structural studies allow the enunciation of new hypotheses concerning the peculiar biochemical properties of EcMnm. The possible role of Arg252 and Arg275, which might work as arginine fingers for the intrinsic catalytic activity, has also been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Purification and GTPase Assay Overproduction and purification of GST fusion proteins were done in strain DEV16 transformed with plasmids pIC684 and pIC758 as previously described.7 GTP hydrolysis was measured by the malachite green assay for the determination of Pi release.8 Determination of Binding Constants for GTP and GDP MnmE and MnmE G-domain were titrated against mant nucleotides (Jena Bioscience) until saturation was reached. The mant nucleotides (2 lM) were excited at 360 nm, and the fluorescence was monitored at 440 nm (Perkin Elmer LS 50 B spectrophotometer, Perkin Elmer, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5% glycerol). The binding constants (Kd values) were calculated by fitting the curves with nonlinear regression, using GraphPad Prism software. In these experiments, we used the MnmE mutant G228A, which is impaired for GTP binding,8 as a negative control. NMR Spectroscopy NMR sample preparation, resonance assignments procedure, and solution secondary structure determination for MnmE G-domain have been previously described by Monleon et al.20 In this previous work, the combined use of automated and manual analysis of triple resonance 3D data, along with the distance connectivities extracted from a 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC)-nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum recorded at 750 MHz, provided assignments for $95% of assignable backbone atoms of the EcMnmE G-domain. Overall, secondary structure for this G-domain, based on these chemical shifts and HN-Ha and HN-HN NOE connectivities, is very similar to that reported for other GTPases such as human Ras or Rac1, or E. coli Era protein. Interestingly, a detailed comparison of NMR secondary structure shows that the bstrands of MnmE G-domain are more similar to those reported for Ras than those reported for the other templates, including TmMnmE (the nearest homologue to EcMnmE with known structure) where helix a2 displays a significant sequence displacement. Structural restraints derived from NMR experimental data are shown in Table I. Unfortunately, the solubility of MnmE G-domain NMR sample is extremely reduced and its stability with respect to pH and temperature conditions is very limited. These adverse factors made the obtaining of additional structural information for a high-resolution experimental structure determination extremely challenging. Sequence Analysis Initial statistics on amino-acid sequence of E. coli MnmE G-domain were performed using ExPASY web

site (http://www.expasy.org). A PSI-BLAST search21 was performed over the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database to find homologues to G-domain with known threedimensional structure. Four very well-resolved X-ray or NMR structures of proteins homologous to EcMnmE Gdomain were used as templates. These structures were chosen based on a high structural quality and proper levels of sequence identity (TmMnmE, 40%; ERA, 36%; Ras, 30%; and Rap2A, 32%). Alignments between the E. coli MnmE G-domain and amino-acidic sequence of templates were initially achieved using CLUSTALW,22 as shown in Figure 1. A numbering for the isolated G-domain amino acid sequence was used,20 followed, where necessary, by the corresponding positions in the fulllength E. coli MnmE amino acid sequence between parentheses. Secondary structure for E. coli MnmE Gdomain was predicted using PREDATOR23 and PhDsec24 with DSSP database algorithm.25 A consensus prediction was calculated and then compared with that obtained by NMR backbone assignments (data not shown). Secondary structure elements and solvent exposure in template structures were identified using DSSP method. Pair wise sequence alignments obtained by CLUSTALW were manually corrected to match maximum number of secondary structure elements and guanine nucleotide binding site motifs between templates and protein target. Lower sequential identity scores were obtained in loops and turns for increased flexibility and structural variability respect to templates. Homology Modeling A structural homology model for EcMnmE G-domain was built using experimental NMR structural information and translation of distance restraints from template structures to target amino-acid sequence.26,27 These were achieved by using two different types of restraints. First, experimental NMR restraints were obtained from the NMR data collected on EcMnmE G-domain. Second, homologous atoms were identified in each template structure and the amino-acid sequence of the target protein, EcMnmE. Then, homology-derived distance restraints were obtained accordingly as explained elsewhere.27 These two type of restraints were weighed differently along the calculations. Experimental NMR restraints were initially included in a very conservative fashion. Upper and lower limits for dihedral angle constraints were obtained by addition and subtraction, respectively, of 308 to dihedral angle value reported by TALOS3,28 from 13 C chemical shift values. Additionally, HN-Ha and HN-HN NOE cross-peaks identified in 15N-HSQC-NOESY spec° trum were included as 5.0 A upper limit distance restraints. The final sets of upper and lower bounds were introduced in the molecular dynamics program DYANA for simulated annealing calculations.29 A relative force constant of 10 was applied to experimental NMR restraints over the homology-derived restraints. Highly violated homology-derived distance restraints were identified and marked as suspicious. In the initial stages of cal-

culations, experimental dihedral angle and distance restraints were heavily weighed with a factor of 20, meanwhile suspicious theoretical homology distance restraints were underweighed with a factor of 0.2. Therefore, the relative weighting factor of experimental NMR restraints over homology-derived distance restraints varied from 10 to 100 depending on the compatibility of the homology with the NMR data. This procedure was applied to direct final structures toward better fitting of available experimental information. Finally, homologous theoretical restraints inconsistent with experimental information were detected and analyzed for deletion in final stage of refinement. The complete protocol allowed to obtain medium resolution structures mostly driven by the experimental data. One hundred structures were calculated for each homology model and the 20 with lowest target function were selected for further CNS simulated annealing refinement.30 Refinement included all structural restraints of previous stages plus Ca/Cb chemical shift values.31 Customized CNS protocols for simulated annealing, including stages of weight annealing and temperature annealing, were used for structure refinement. A final ``conjugate gradients'' energy minimization including only experimental restraints was performed to fix possible artifacts. The complete protocol was applied to four different protein structure templates with high sequence similarity to E. coli MnmE G-domain. Initially, close homologous protein Era was chosen as the first template32 (PDB ID 1EGA, Era from E. coli). The crystal structure available in the PDB database was found only in its free form, as

the MnmE G-domain sample studied here. The canonical GTPase protein Ras was also selected as a template. The NMR structure of Ras in solution was retrieved in its GDP-bound form33 (PDB ID 1CRR, Ras from H. sapiens), as no high resolution structure of its free form was found. The NMR solution structure of another mono-domain GTPase protein, Rap2A34 (PDB ID 1KAO from H. sapiens), was chosen from the PDB database in its GDPbound form for similar reasons. In addition, after the recent release of the PDB coordinates for free TmMnmE16 (PDB ID 1XZP), the closest homologue to E. coli MnmE, its crystal structure was included in the set of templates. Homology theoretical distance restraints were derived from the four different template structures separately. As a consequence, we were able to identify the most structurally homologous protein among the templates by comparison of results with respect to the experimental data. The complete protocol was first tested using Ras, whose structure is well known, as the target molecule. The structure of human Ras was calculated using Rap2A and Era structures as templates. NOE restraints were derived from the calculated average HN-Hadistances for human Ras. A number of distances equivalent to those used in the calculations of EcMnmE G-domain structure was randomly ° selected from all HN-Ha distances shorter than 4.5 A. ° Upper limit for NOE restraints was always set to 5 A. Chemical shift information for human Ras calculation was introduced also in the refinement stage. Stereo chemical quality of final models was measured with program PROCHECK. An additional stage of structure validation was performed by back calculation of

The differences were calculated by averaging the deviation between calculated and experimental values for Ca and Cb chemical shifts. These differences together with the violations of the experimental structural restraints were used for ranking homology models. Structure analysis and ribbon diagrams have been made using MOLMOL.36

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION MnmE G-domain Biochemical Properties The isolated GTPase domain of MnmE roughly conserves the guanine nucleotide binding and the GTPase activities of the intact protein, i.e. low affinity for nucleotides and a relatively high intrinsic GTPase activity.7 However, affinity for nucleotides was determined by using a filter binding assay, which is not the best procedure to precisely calculate the Kd values, especially when proteins bind nucleotides with low affinity. In fact, this assay did not allow to accurately measure the Kd for GDP of MnmE and its G-domain. To gain proper information on the guanine nucleotide binding properties of these molecules, we performed binding studies in solution with fluorescent nucleotides. Titration experiments allowed us to determine that the Kd values for mant-GTPgS and mant-GDP of MnmE and its G-domain are in the micromolar range (Table II). It should be noted that affinity for mant-GDP of both the entire protein and its G-domain is somewhat lower than for mantGTPgS, and that the MnmE G-domain binds mantGTPgS 2-fold more efficiently than the entire protein. Both proteins, MnmE and its G-domain, have a similar catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km), although the last one exhibits smaller values of kcat and Km. The differences in nucleotide affinity and catalytic parameters between both proteins may be due to the higher freedom degree of the N- and C-terminal ends of the MnmE G-domain in relation to the entire protein.

Electrostatic Potential Calculations Best overall model from MnmE G-domain structure calculations was selected for electrostatic potential distribution plot on the protein surface using the corresponding modules of MOLMOL36 program. Solvent accessibility was calculated with PROCHECK37 and residues with accessibility values larger than 0.5 were chosen as solvent exposed residues. ``Contact'' was the method selected for protein surface determination, which was colored using a GRASP standard criterion. Electrostatic potential calculation was performed using the standard MOLMOL macro for this purpose, which is based on simple coulomb interaction. Atom charges and protonation state of amino acids were derived with the ``pdb_charge'' MOLMOL macro with adequate corrections for secondary structure conformations by interpolation for a pH of 6.

For Ga subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, the formation of a complex was shown among the protein, GDP (including Mg2þ) and aluminium fluoride (for a short review, see Ref. 6). This complex is believed to mimic the transition state of GTP hydrolysis, because it is stabilized by the helical domain of Ga (which contains the catalytic arginine), and the aluminium fluoride complex has a planar configuration, as supposed for the g-phosphate group in the transition state. Small GTPases are not able to form such a complex; however, in the pres-

ence of GAP, the formation of the aluminium fluoride complex is possible because some GAP residues complement the active site of Ras-like proteins.38 Proteins from the dynamin family, which exhibit a high intrinsic activity, also form a complex, in their GDP-bound form, with aluminium fluoride. In this case, similar to that observed in Ga subunits, all residues required for the geometry of the transition state are supplied ``in cis'' from the GTPase itself.39 As shown in Figure 2, the isolated MnmE G-domain is able to form a complex with GDP and aluminium fluoride as efficiently as the entire protein, supporting the idea that the MnmE G-domain contains the catalytic residues that explain for the relatively high intrinsic GTPase activity of this protein. Formation of the MnmEmant-GDPAlFx complex occurs at both pH 7.5 and pH 5.5 [Fig. 3(A,B) respectively], and binding of MnmE to mant-GTPgS is not greatly affected by acidic pH [Fig. 3(C)]; however, hydrolysis of GTP by MnmE or MnmE G-domain is drastically reduced at pH 6.5 or 5.5 (see Fig. 4). This last result suggests that the ionization state of some residue(s) of the MnmE G-domain, critical for GTP hydrolysis, is severely affected by low pH. The fact that formation of the MnmEmantGDPAlFx complex is not affected under such condition suggests that the chemistry of this complex is different to that of the true transition state, even though it might

well be a very close structural approximation, and that the residue(s) critical for the precise geometry of the transition state is not required for stabilization of AlFx.40,41 Structure Calculation As mentioned in Materials and Methods, the complete protocol used for the calculation of MnmE G-domain was first applied to determine the human Ras structure from data of ERA and Rap2A proteins. A model for Ras was built using translation of distance restraints and experimental NMR structural information. Although such an approach has already been used successfully in the past, a definitive method for validation of the final results has not been established.18,19,42 In this work, chemical shift theoretical prediction has been used as a tool for both improving and validating the structure calculations. The human Ras structure calculated using NMR data driven homology modeling was compared with the experimental NMR structure deposited in the PDB, as a validation of the method. The comparison between this experimental structure and the models calculated from the two different templates (Era and Rap2A) is shown in Figure 5. The model from Rap2A provides better agreement with the experimental structure of Ras than the model from Era. RMSD for backbone atoms of best defined regions (as defined in original work by Kraulis et al.,33 residues ° 1­29, 39­57, and 69­166) were of 1.5 and 2.1 A for structures modeled from Rap2A and Era, respectively. As expected from the strong contribution of experimental information, both models are very similar to the experimental Ras structure, and they differ to the original templates used to extract the homology information. The results of this NMR-driven homology modeling for a known structure of similar characteristics to our target
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

support that the method can be successfully applied to the MnmE G-domain. In addition, chemical shift back calculation shows better agreement for the Ras model from Rap2A than for the model from Era (average difference of 1.211 ppm versus 1.617 ppm, respectively). The model from template Rap2A is in fact closer to the NMR experimental structure of Ras than the model from template Era. Interestingly, the method provided adequate side chain orientation. Mean deviation between experimental and calculated average v1 value was $908. More than 60% of the side chains show deviations lower than 1208. The deviations were always lower than 608 when differences between experimental and back-calculated chemical shifts were lower than 0.75 ppm. The combination of Cb chemical shift restraints together with steric impediments seems to produce better side chain orientation calculations. The overall result also suggests the usefulness of these calculations as a possible validation method for homology models with limited NMR experimental information. It also provides a good validation for the structural homology hypothesis. Once the method was validated for a protein homologous to our target, a model for the EcMnmE G-domain was built using experimental NMR structural information and translation of distance restraints. In general, NMR-homology-modeling calculations for all four different templates (Ras, Rap2A, Era, and TmMnmE Gdomains) provided E. coli MnmE G-domain models with very similar fold. This was expected as experimental restraints were introduced with a high force constant in all calculations. A more detailed analysis of the threedimensional models revealed some differences, mainly located in the largely disordered regions. Table III shows the different structural statistics of the best models calculated from the TmMnmE template as representative of our calculations. Homology modeling with respect to

1XZP (TmMnmE) provides the best structural statistics in our calculations. Ramachandran plot percentages as well as amounts of close contacts indicate that homology models calculated with respect to 1XZP template show better stereo-chemical quality than the other models. Moreover, back-calculated chemical shift values for this model show higher degree of consistency with respect to experimental values than for the other models (see Fig. 6). Average chemical shift differences between experimental and back-calculated values were 1.176, 1.347, 1.488, and 1.679 ppm for structures modeled from templates TmMnmE, Era, Ras, and Rap2A, respectively. Therefore, NMR-driven homology-model obtained from 1XZP (TmMnmE) template was selected as G-domain three-dimensional structure for further analysis. Coordinates for final selected model of E. coli MnmE G-domain protein have been deposited at the PDB (http://www.pdb. org, PDB accession code 1RFL). MnmE G-domain Structure The structure of the GTPase domain of EcMnmE consists of a central four-stranded b-sheet flanked by five ahelices, as it is shown in Figure 7(A). This pattern is also supported by the secondary structure determined from the backbone resonance assignments.20 Residues in helical conformation include amino acids 22­31, 72­82, 102­112, 134­143, and 154­166 (231­240, 281­291, 311­ 321, 343­352, and 363­375, in full-length numbering). Residues in central b-sheet include 7­14, 89­94, 116­ 121, and 146­149 (216­223, 298­303, 325­330, and 355­ 358, in full-length numbering). Additionally, residues 48­52 and 55­63 seems to be in b-strand conformation in some of the models, forming a b-hairpin (marked with a * in Fig. 7) detected in most of the other GTPase structures with a similar orientation. Helix a2, although it is conserved in all the calculated models, shows more dis-

persion as a result of the low number of experimental restraints. This high dispersion together with some broad peaks in the NMR spectra suggests some flexibility for this structural element. Interestingly, the orientation of this helix is one of the structural features less conserved across GTPases, as shown in Figure 8, although it could be due to that the structures here compared are in their free or GDP-bound forms.6 In general, the G-domain of EcMnmE resembles other G-domains although some peculiar features deserve special attention (see Fig. 8). Differently to mono-domain GTPase proteins as Ras21 and Rap2A, and similarly to other multi-domain proteins as Era and TmMnmE, the central b-sheet in EcMnmE G-domain maintains a flat shape. Although TmMnmE and EcMnmE G-domains share many common structural features, some significant differences can be detected. As mentioned earlier, the second helix of the EcMnmE G-domain (south-east part of the protein in Fig. 7) displays an orientation different to that observed for TmMnmE. Although the location of this helix is fairly conserved across all GTPases, its orientation seems to be slightly different in each case. Helix a2 does not show many interactions with the rest of the G-domain in most of the GTPase structures reported to date. Interestingly, this helix seems to show more interactions with the core of the GTPase domain in TmMnmE than in the remaining proteins, including the EcMnmE G-domain, a fact that could be related to the higher thermal stability of the T. maritime protein.44 On the other hand, due to the proximity of this helix to the hypothetical switch II, a change in its orientation might occur upon GTP binding. Similar to that observed in TmMnmE and Era, the loop where the G1 site is located (the P-loop) is shorter in EcMnmE than in Ras21 (as determined by MOLSCRIPT, disordered residues 10­16 in Ras21 and disorDOI 10.1002/prot

Finally, the switch I segment of EcMnmE, TmMnmE, and Era has two extra residues in helical conformation with respect to Ras. On the other hand, the switch II segment is three residues longer in EcMnmE than in Era and seven residues longer than in Ras, augmenting the protruding conformation of the corresponding loop.

Conserved Motifs G and Catalytic Activity In all GTPase proteins, four conserved motifs (G1­G4) of the amino acid chain deserve special attention because of their participation in GTP binding and hydrolysis. An additional motif G5 has also been reported although it is not totally conserved (except in the Ras family). This G5 site is only partially conserved in EcMnmE. In Figure 9 these five conserved motifs have been highlighted over the three-dimensional structure of the EcMnmE G-domain. All the G motifs are located on the same side of the protein, as expected.1 Those responsible for the binding to the GTP phosphate groups and the Mg2þ ion (mainly G1, G2, and G3) are close in the space.

residues involved in the binding to the aromatic ring and the specificity for the guanine base (mainly G4 and the partially conserved G5) are also close to each other and on the other side of the phosphorous recognition site. Thus, the pocket for the binding of GTP conserves the three-dimensional distribution of motifs G observed in other GTPases. Similar to Era, the G2 site of EcMnmE contains two consecutive threonines, Thr41 and Thr42, which may play the role that Thr35 plays in Ras.6 Biochemical studies showed that Thr42 is the critical threonine for the hydrolysis of GTP, but mutation of Thr41 also impairs to some degree GTP hydrolysis.9 Side-chain of Thr42 is partially oriented toward G1 and probably is involved in some interactions with the phosphate group, as would be expected from a conservative role for this residue in coordination of Mg2þ and g-phosphate.6 Such a role is crucial for the conformational changes associated with binding and hydrolysis of GTP. Side chains of residues Gly19 in motif G1 and Asp61in motif G3 (Gly228 and Asp270, in full-length numbering), reported to be critical for GTP binding and hydrolysis,8 are both exposed to the solvent, suggesting a role in the interaction with the GTP molecule. The spatial distribution of both residues is consistent with their respective roles in GTP binding and Mg2þ coordination.8 Different to other GTPases, both MnmE and its G-domain do not require the presence in trans of a GAP to exhibit a relatively high hydrolase activity in vitro. The hydrolase activity of the G-domain by itself eliminates the possibility of some arginine-finger mechanism from

other parts of MnmE (Table II). There are some conserved arginines in the G-domain that could act as catalytic residues in the hydrolysis of GTP. Among them, Arg43 and Arg66 (Arg252 and Arg275, respectively, in full-length numbering) seem to be important for the GTPase activity.9 However, the three-dimensional conformation of the EcMnmE G-domain and the location of
PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics

these conserved arginines suggest that none of them plays a direct role in the hydrolysis process (see Fig. 9). This structural information is supported by the low differences between experimental and back-calculated chemical shift values for residues in these regions (see Fig. 6). Activity studies performed on several mutants of EcMnmE are in agreement with this hypothesis.9 Moreover,

EcMnmE has a leucine just behind the G3 motif in place of the catalytic glutamine present in Ras proteins6 (see Fig. 1). Thus, it can be proposed that hydrolysis of GTP by MnmE takes place through a mechanism different to that involving an intra-molecular arginine-finger and a glutamine to orient the attacking water molecule. Interestingly, Arg43 side chain is oriented toward the carbonyl group of Gly40 and it may form some hydrogen bonding under certain circumstances. The orientation of this side chain in our models is partially supported by the small difference found between experimental and back-calculated values for the Cb chemical shift (only 0.58 ppm). This potential hydrogen bonding might explain why when Arg43 is mutated to Ala, the MnmE GTPase activity is reduced in a greater extent than when it is mutated to Lys.9 In addition, the fact that mutation of Gly40 to Ala in the entire protein (G249A) reduces drastically the GTPase activity and greatly perturbs formation of a transition-state mimic9 suggests that Gly40 lies close to the catalytic center of the MnmE G-domain and that even the smallest possible amino acid change (to alanine) would sterically interfere with the geometry of the transition state. The structure of the MnmE G-domain here presented supports that the interaction between Gly40 and Arg43 might play some stabilization role in the intermediate state of hydrolysis. Electrostatic Potential Distribution at the Protein Surface To achieve a better understanding of the possible interactions of the EcMnmE G-domain with the remaining domains and the GTP molecule, the electrostatic potential at the protein surface has been calculated and compared with its closest homologues (see Fig. 10). Obviously, a detailed analysis of the electrostatic potential distribution at the protein surface of the EcMnmE G-domain requires a precise determination of the side-chain orientation of all residues. However, a general analysis of the medium-resolution structure presented here also provides useful information on the global electrostatics of the molecule. The electrostatic potential of the MnmE G-domain resembles that exhibited by mono-domain GTPases and seems fairly equilibrated, in contrast to that observed for Era. As in the case of Ras and Rap2A, negative regions are predominant on the active-site side of the protein. However, the areas where the GTP molecule is supposed to bind maintain a slightly positive or neutral character. The regions surrounding G2 (which includes Arg43) display a fairly equilibrated and neutral potential, supporting the absence of an intra-molecular arginine finger mechanism. Interestingly, although the structure of EcMnmE G-domain is very similar to that of its homologue Era, which is also a multi-domain protein, the electrostatic potential distribution at the surface is more resemblance to that reported for mono-domain GTPases, as mentioned earlier. This feature is also shared by the TmMnmE protein, which is the closest homologue of EcMnmE. This may contribute to the little

or no loss of activity shown by the truncated G-domain of MnmE proteins with respect to the full-length protein (Table II). The G-domain of MnmE is a electrostatically equilibrated unit by its own in contrast to the Era G-domain, which seems to need the effect of its remaining domains to achieve electrostatic equilibrium.

CONCLUDING REMARKS MnmE is a multidomain GTPase with peculiar biochemical properties. Its G-domain, when isolated, maintains the GTPase features of the entire protein and, thus, it should contain the catalytic residues responsible for the relatively high MnmE GTPase activity. Our results suggest that some of these residues suffer pHsensitive chemical shifts during GTP hydrolysis. To explain the GTPase and nucleotide binding properties of MnmE, structure resolution of free and nucleotide-bound forms of MnmE or its G-domain is crucial. As a first step, a three-dimensional medium-resolution structure for the G-domain of E. coli MnmE has been solved. A combination of experimental NMR restraints and homology structural information allowed the determination of this structure otherwise extremely challenging. The use of chemical shift structure-based prediction provided a good basis for the improvement of the structure calculation process and for the validation of the final results. In general, the structure of MnmE G-domain resembles that of other GTPases. The overall folding consists in a central b-strand with six extended elements surrounded by five a-helices. The flexible region of the P-loop of MnmE G-domain is shorter than that observed in canonical GTPases, as confirmed by most of our homology models and by the X-ray structure of T. maritime TrmE.16 In contrast, disordered segments of the switch I and II regions are longer than those observed in other GTPases, suggesting increased flexibility and stronger conformational changes upon hydrolysis, which appear to be essential for MnmE function.8,9 Our structure and previous investigations rule out an internal arginine finger mechanism as the reason for the high intrinsic activity for MnmE and its G-domain. The structure of MnmE presented here provided some insight into the role played by Arg43, which seems to be important for catalytic activity. The side chain of this arginine may form under certain circumstances some hydrogen bond with Gly40, stabilizing the conformation of the theoretical intermediate state. Overall, our structural study allows to answer some questions raised in previous studies and supplies a base to approach unsolved questions in the next future.
