NAD+-dependent (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH) catalyses the reduction of 2-oxoglutarate to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate and belongs to the D-2-hydroxyacid NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase (D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase) protein family. Its crystal structure was determined by ° phase combination to 1.98 A resolution. Structure­function relationships obtained by the comparison of HGDH with other members of the D-2hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family give a chemically satisfying view of the substrate stereoselectivity and catalytic requirements for the hydride transfer reaction. A model for substrate recognition and turnover is discussed. The HGDH active site architecture is structurally optimized to recognize and bind the negatively charged substrate 2-oxoglutarate. The structural position of the side chain of Arg52, and its counterparts in other family members, strongly correlates with substrate specificity towards substitutions at the C3 atom (linear or branched substrates). Arg235 interacts with the substrate's a-carboxylate and carbonyl groups, having a dual role in both substrate binding and activation, and the c-carboxylate group can dock at an arginine cluster. The proton-relay system built up by Glu264 and His297 permits His297 to act as acid­base catalyst and the 4Re-hydrogen from NADH is transferred as hydride to the carbonyl group Si-face leading to the formation of the correct enantiomer (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate.

The physiological role of NAD+-dependent (R)-2hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH, E.C. 1.1.1.-) is the reduction of 2-oxoglutarate (pKeq ¼ 11.8) to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate coupled with the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ (Scheme 1). The reaction equilibrium constant (Keq ¼ 1.47 · 10)12 M) lies on the side of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate production [1]. The optimum pH is 8.0 (specific activity of 4800 UÆmg)1) with a Km

value of 134 lM for 2-oxoglutarate (at 100 lM NADH) [2]. In Acidaminococcus fermentans, a nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacterium (order Clostridiales, family Acidaminococcaceae) commonly found in the digestive tract of mammals [3], HGDH catalyses the second step of the hydroxyglutarate pathway in glutamate fermentation, the prominent energy metabolism in the microorganism [4]. During catalysis, the 4Re-hydrogen

(Prelog­Helmchen Re / Si-system [5]), at the C4N atom of the nicotinamide moiety of the reduced coenzyme (NADH), is transferred as hydride [6], making HGDH an `A-side' specific dehydrogenase [7,8]. HGDH is a member of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase protein family [9]. Other members structurally characterized are formate dehydrogenase ([10,11], Protein Data Bank (PDB) codes 2NAC and 2NAD for apo- and holoFDH, respectively), D-glycerate dehydrogenase ([12], PDB code 1GDH for apoGDH), D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase ([13], PDB code 1PSD for holoPGDH), D-lactate dehydrogenase (PDB code 2DLD for the ternary complex of LDH with oxamate; [14]; PDB code 1J49 for holoLDH [15]) and D-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase ([16], PDB code 1DXY for the ternary complex of HicDH with 2-oxoisocaproate). This protein family has considerable biotechnological potential in the chiral synthesis of both organic compounds and nonproteogenic amino acids for pharmaceutical and medical applications (e.g. used as a diagnostic reagent to monitor the serum levels of amino acids that accumulate in a range of metabolic diseases) [17,18]. D-2-Hydroxyacid dehydrogenases are structurally folded into two domains joined by a hinge and separated by a deep cleft containing the active site. The hinge region mediates domain movements involved in enzymatic catalysis (examples for such an enzymatic reaction are given in [19] and references within). Whereas the smaller domain referred to as the catalytic
270

or substrate-binding domain can be quite variable in structure (as expected from the diverse substrate specificity), the larger domain designated the nucleotidebinding domain displays a well-preserved fold indicating its evolutionary structural conservation (as expected from its role in coenzyme binding). The same protein overall fold (structural variant of the bab Rossmann fold [20]), is displayed by members of the transcriptional regulators protein family (C-terminal binding protein, CtBP [21]). The key catalytic residues have been identified by biochemical [22­27] and structural analyses ([11­ 13,15]). A conserved histidine-glutamate pair functions as a proton-relay system. An arginine lining the active site has been implicated in recognition and binding of the substrate by a salt bridge with the carboxyl group. The coenzyme binding mode, in a `boomerang' conformation with the carboxamide of the nicotinamide moiety anti to the ribose moiety has been characterized in the crystal structures of holoFDH [11], holoPGDH [13], the ternary complex of HicDH [16] and the holoand ternary complex of LDH ([15], PDB code 2DLD). This orientation directs the Re-hydrogen (pro-R hydrogen) of the nicotinamide ring towards the substrate to be reduced. This explains the pro-R (A-side) specificity displayed by these enzymes [28]. However, it remains to be clarified how the protein backbone controls the substrate stereorecognition for each member of the protein family as their substrates range from the small formate (nonchiral) up to the more structurally elaborated and larger molecules 2-hydroxyisocaproate or 2-oxoglutarate. Here we present the crystal structure of apoHGDH from A. fermentans determined at a ° resolution of 1.98 A. The structural analysis of HGDH together with the comparison with other structurally characterized members of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase protein family further contributes to clarify the molecular mechanisms of substrate stereospecificity and its catalytic turnover.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination by phase combination and model refinement Unsuccessful approaches HGDH crystallised in the presence of NAD+, 2-oxoglutarate or oxalylglycine showed no corresponding electron density. An increase in the concentration of these compounds resulted in the growth of partial merohedral twin crystals with cell dimensions of ° ° approximately a ¼ b ¼ 64 A, c ¼ 170 A, a ¼ b ¼ 90° and c ¼ 120° (twin fraction of 0.42 ± 0.01; partial

merohedral twinning test at http://www.doe-mbi.ucla. edu / Services / Twinning / ). All attempts to interpret and use the data sets failed. Due to the amino acid sequence identity of roughly 30% between HGDH and other members of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase protein family (Fig. 1), Patterson search techniques were tried. The best result obtained with AMoRe [29] was for space group P6122 (CC of 31.5 and R-factor of 54.7%). However, the model building was hindered by the poor quality of the calculated phases. A second approach was the use of heavy atom derivatives, and a complete MAD dataset was collected at the Ta L-III ° edge to a resolution of 2.79 A. The Ta6Br12 clusters were located in a crystallographic special position (along the z-axis), which hindered the determination of the crystal structure using the phases gained from the MAD experiment alone. Successful methodology The breakthrough to determine the crystal structure was the use of phase combination (see Materials and

methods for details). The resulting electron density map was of excellent quality and it was possible to assign the complete amino acid sequence. The model ° was refined to 1.98 A resolution with Rcryst of 0.177, Rfree of 0.225 and good stereochemistry (Table 1). The refined model includes the complete polypeptide chain (Met1­Lys331) and 396 solvent molecules. Disordered side chains (no clear electron density) of residues at the surface of the protein were modelled according to the more stable conformer. The electron density for the cispeptide bond between residues Tyr289 and Pro290 is clearly defined. Statistics for data processing, phasing and structure refinement are shown in Table 1.

(PDB code 2DLD, [14,15]), and HicDH [16]. This indicates that the quaternary structure of HGDH represents the physiological dimer in solution [4] as also found for the other family members (FDH [30]; GDH [31]; PGDH, where the dimer is part of the functional tetramer [32]; LDH [22]; and HicDH [33]). The dimer interface, built up mainly by helix aA from the nucleotide-binding domain, has a hydrophobic character with few salt bridges and solvent molecules involved. Helix aA lies diagonal across the interface and together with aC build up the reverse side while helices aB and aF (one from each monomer) pack together at the front of the interface (in the orientation displayed in Fig. 2A). Each monomer has the shape of a dumb-bell and consists of two compact domains separated by a cleft ° ° that is approximately 18 · 15 A2 wide and 12 A deep (Fig. 2B). Both domains are structural variants of the bab Rossmann fold [20] and their related topology, with several a-helices packed against an open twisted ° b-sheet, can be seen from the rmsd of 1.8 A for the respective superimposed Ca atoms. The smaller domain (upper domain in Fig. 2B; residues 1­101 and 302­331), composed of a five-stranded parallel b-sheet flanked by five helices, is designated the substrate-binding domain. The larger domain (lower domain in Fig. 2B; residues 102­301), comprising a seven-stranded parallel b-sheet flanked by seven helices, contains the consensus nucleotide-binding
272

sequence motif GXGX2GX17D [GXGX2GX17D(153­ 176) in HGDH; Fig. 1] and is therefore referred as the nucleotide-binding domain. The strictly conserved Asp176 is the key residue in the recognition and binding of the cofactor NAD+ (instead of NADP+ [34]). The two domains are connected through a hinge region (residues 100­102 and 299­302, coloured green in Fig. 2B) that mediates the interdomain flexibility required for efficient substrate binding and catalysis (closure of the interdomain cleft and consequent shielding of the active site from solvent [35]). The superposition of HGDH with other structurally characterized D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases clearly shows that, as expected by the absence of bound coenzyme or substrate, HGDH displays an open conformation (Fig. 3). The closure of the interdomain cleft results from the rotation of the substrate-binding domain (as a rigid body) towards the nucleotide-binding domain from the position in the apo (open conformation, Fig. 3B) to that found in the holo or ternary complexes (closed conformation, Fig. 3A for holoFDH and holoLDH) [36]. In agreement with this, it is the substrate-binding domain that displays the highest conformational variability (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the ternary complexes of HicDH [16] and LDH show the enzyme in the open conformation with both coenzyme and substrate (2-oxoisocaproate partially superimposed with a sulfate ion

Active site architecture The active site is located at the bottom of the inter° domain cleft at approximately 12 A below the surface of the protein with the catalytic triad Arg235, Glu264 and His297 facing into the cleft (Fig. 4, and Fig. 5A for a closer view). The residues lining the active site are all well defined except for Arg235, which displays residual electron density for two possible conformations, one pointing towards His297 (used in the structural analysis) and another pointing towards Asp81. The proton-relay system built up by the histidineglutamate dyad (His297-Glu264 in HGDH) is conserved in all D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases with the exception of FDH (His-Gln dyad [11]). Both residues are involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction where

the negative charge of the glutamate stabilizes the protonated state of the histidine (positively charged). Glu264 shifts the pKa of His297 to a higher value, enabling it to act as an acid­base catalyst at the pH value required for the proton transfer [23]. Apart from participating in the proton transfer reaction, histidine forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the substrate (or hydroxyl group in the reverse reaction) and stabilizes the reaction transition state [24]. The third residue of the catalytic triad is Arg235. Its positive guanidinium moiety plays an essential role in the polarization of the substrate's carbonyl group, increasing its susceptibility for a nucleophilic attack [37]. Additionally, this residue is involved in binding the substrate's a-carboxylate group [14,16] and in the activation of the coenzyme [11]. A positively charged patch at the top right side of the active site (orientation shown in Figs 4 and 5B) is formed by Arg9, Arg52 and Arg76. In contrast to the well conserved Arg9 and Arg76, residues in the D-2hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family corresponding to

cluster (orientation shown in Fig. 4) protect that side of the interdomain cleft from solvent. This suggests that these bulky / hydrophobic side chains contribute to delineate the architecture of the active site pocket and the consequent modulation of 2-oxoglutarate recognition and binding (through its c-carboxylate group) by the arginine cluster. Similar contributions from the second monomer are observed in PGDH (with phenylalanine [13]) and LDH and HicDH (with isoleucine [15]). On the left topside of the active site (orientation shown in Figs 4 and 5A,B) Thr77, Asp81 and the main chain contributed by Ala78 and Gly79 build up a polar pocket. Structural studies of FDH [11], LDH [14] and HicDH [16] have indicated that this structural motif (Thr77­Gly79 in HGDH) has a functional role in binding the substrate's a-carboxylate group. Another polar patch formed by the hydrogen-bonded Tyr101 and Ser300 (at the rear of the cleft wall as displayed in the orientation of Figs 4 and 5A) also contributes to the orientation of the substrate within the active site. Tyr101 is substituted by an asparagine in FDH [11], a serine in PGDH [13] and a valine in GDH [12], and Ser300 is exchanged by a phenylalanine in LDH [14], tyrosine in HicDH [16], glycine in PGDH [13] and FDH [11], and serine in GDH [12]. This variability correlates with the dimensions of the active site pocket and thus with the electrostatic properties of the respective substrate: bulky or hydrophobic side chains for aliphatic substrates as in HicDH [16] and LDH [14], and polar side chains for hydrophilic substrates as in PGDH [13] and HGDH (this study). The lower wall of the cleft below the active site displays a hydrophobic character with residues Ile106 and Ile157 at the back of the wall and a mixed patch with Val260 and Asp259 at the front part (orientation shown in Fig. 4). These residues are well conserved (Fig. 1), and together with the aliphatic side chains from Pro103 and Ala107 have been proposed to play a structural role in the higher affinity for NADH than for NAD+ (as observed for L-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases [38]) and the correct orientation of the coenzyme's nicotinamide moiety [16]. By packing against the B-side of the pyridinium ring the enzyme assures that only the Re-hydrogen (on the A-side) is exposed for catalysis. Additionally to its interaction with the carboxamide moiety [11], Asp259 is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network with the peptide backbone of the loop containing Ser300. This structural feature, conserved among other members of the protein family, supports the proposed role of Ser300 and Tyr101 in substrate specificity. All of the critical residues are conserved among the homologous HGDH from Fusobacterium nucleatum

[39] (data not shown), especially Arg52, which we consider to determine the substrate specificity. Structural basis for substrate stereorecognition and hydride transfer The structural analysis of HGDH and its comparison with other structurally characterized members of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family allows us to gain insight into the substrate specificity and reaction mechanism of HGDH. As mentioned earlier, there is broad substrate specificity among the members of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family. Therefore, correlations between substrate and active site properties can be inferred from their structural analysis. As expected by its substrate specificity towards lactate, the active site of LDH [15] has reduced dimensions with polar and hydrophobic character (Fig. 6A). As seen by the superposition of its active site with that from HGDH (Fig. 6B), the architecture of the two pockets is very dissimilar, correlating well with their unrelated substrates (pyruvate for LDH and 2-oxoglutarate for HGDH). While the LDH active site is small and displays a general noncharged surface, the active site from HGDH is wider (even allowing that LDH is in the close conformation) and displays a generally positively charged surface (Fig. 5B), optimized to bind the negatively charged 2-oxoglutarate molecule. A similar observation can be made from the comparison between the active sites from HicDH [16] (wide and with a generally apolar surface, ideal to bind the 2-oxoisocaproate substrate; Fig. 6C) and HGDH (Figs 5B and 6D). One crucial event for catalysis in NADH-dependent dehydrogenases is the activation of the coenzyme, namely the enhancement of the electrophilicity of the nicotinamide moiety (at the pyridinium C4N atom containing the Re- and Si-hydrogen atoms) [40]. The coenzyme molecule is bound at the bottom wall of the interdomain cleft, sandwiched between the C-terminal ends of the b-strands bA, bB, bD­bF and helices aA and aC with the adenine moiety docked in a structurally conserved hydrophobic pocket (Val152, Ala206, Pro207, Val177, Ile209 and Val215 in HGDH). The adenine moiety interacts with a polar side chain (Asn212 in HGDH) and the pyrophosphate with a solvent molecule (HOH 1048 in HGDH), both structurally conserved. Additional interactions are possible with the consensus nucleotide-binding sequence motif [GXGX2GX17D(153­176) for HGDH], responsible for coenzyme discrimination [34]. Structural studies [11] have suggested that the coenzyme activation results from docking the B-side of the nicotinamide moiety against the hydrophobic patch built by aliphatic side

chains (Pro103, Ile106, Ala107 and Ile157 in HGDH) and the backbone of the loop containing His297 (Leu298­Ser300 in HGDH). Additionally, hydrogenbonding interactions between the carboxamide group and both a conserved aspartate (Asp259 in HGDH) and a backbone carbonyl group (Cys233 in HGDH) lock this group in the cis-conformation (related to the pyridinium ring). Both residues also play a role in the polarization of the C4N atom for hydride transfer [40,41]. Tyr101 can also participate as observed in FDH (its structural position is occupied by Asn146 [11]), LDH (Tyr202 [15]) and HicDH (Tyr100 [16]). A second important factor is the asymmetric induction of the substrate [37], namely the correct orientation of the substrate (Re- / Si-face) related to the coenzyme and proton-relay system, to originate a productive ternary complex. In HGDH the architecture of the active site with the arginine cluster (c-carboxylate group binding), the opposite polar patches and Arg235 (a-carboxylate group binding), and the proton-relay system Glu264-His297 is structurally optimized to recognize and fix the substrate for the correct stereochemical hydride transfer reaction (substrate's Si-face opposite to the A-side of the coenzyme; Fig. 5). This structural optimization for substrate recognition and turnover is also displayed by other members of the protein family, e.g. LDH (Fig. 6A) and HicDH (Fig. 6C). The reduction of 2-oxoglutarate by HGDH is inhibited by the substrate analogue oxalylglycine (a weak competitive inhibitor; Ki ¼ 5 mM). Substitution of the 3-methylene group by an amide (NH) can result in the formation of an extra hydrogen-bonding interaction to the enzyme (probably Ser300), to yield an unproductive complex. L-Glutamate dehydrogenase [an NAD(P)+-dependent enzyme; EC 1.4.1.3] is also inhibited by oxalylglycine (Ki ¼ 3­5 lM [42]). This different affinity results from the dissimilar active site environments displayed by both enzymes (HGDH this study and L-glutamate dehydrogenase [43]). Interdomain cleft closure and catalysis The flexible character of the interdomain cleft permits the exchange between binding of both substrate and cofactor, their catalytic turnover and the release of product and cofactor ([19] and references within). In contrast to L-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases where the active site is shielded from solvent through the closure of the active site loop [44], in D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases (that lack such a loop) the solvent exclusion results from the closure of the interdomain cleft via rotation of the substrate-binding domain towards the nucleotide-binding domain as indicated by the

structural analysis of apo and holoFDH [11]. However (and correlating with a common evolutionary origin for the two protein families) kinetic and structural studies [13] have indicated a sequential binding of coenzyme and substrate to the enzyme in its open conformation followed by the closure of the interdomain cleft. In FDH, the structural ordering of the C-terminal helix and the rotation of helix aA observed upon coenzyme binding results in the interdomain cleft closure [11]. Helix aA is the major component of the dimer interface (helix aA in HGDH; Fig. 2A), explaining the structural rigidity observed for the nucleotidebinding domain when compared to the flexibility displayed by the substrate-binding domain in the open and closed enzyme conformations (Fig. 3). When applied to HGDH, substrate may bind first to the wall of the cleft composed of the substrate-binding domain, where its c-carboxylate group would complement the arginine cluster. Closure of the interdomain cleft would bring the substrate's a-carboxylate group into the second anion binding site (Thr77­Gly79, Asp81, Tyr101, Ser300 and Arg235), resulting in substrate positioning between the coenzyme and the proton-relay system His297-Glu264 and consequent solvent exclusion from the active site (Fig. 5). Alternatively, the interdomain cleft closure can result from the substrate movement towards the second anion-binding site. Whatever the driving force for the closure mechanism is, the cooperative binding of substrate and coenzyme most certainly plays a role, as suggested by the absence of structures with substrate / inhibitor bound alone. The product (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate and oxidized coenzyme NAD+ can exit by a reopening of the interdomain cleft. In addition to explaining the functionality of the catalytic triad, the structure­function relationships obtained by the comparison of HGDH with other structurally characterized members of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase protein family give a chemically satisfying view of the molecular mechanisms of substrate stereoselectivity and of the hydride transfer reaction.

exchange with DEAE, hydrophobic interaction with PhenylSepharose, gel permeation with Superose-12 and a final polishing step with Mono-Q). Pure homogeneous HGDH (with a specific activity of 4800 UÆmg)1 [3]) was stored at 4 °C in a saturated solution of ammonium sulfate. HGDH was crystallised by the sitting drop vapour diffusion method at 4 °C. Prior to setting up the crystallization drops the protein was concentrated to 5 mgÆmL)1 and the buffer was exchanged to 5 mM Mops pH 7.0. The droplets were composed of 3 lL protein, 1 lL precipitant solution [15­18% (w / v) PEG MME 2000 or PEG 2000, and 0.2 M sodium or lithium acetate, pH 7.0­8.0] and 0.3­1.0 lL cofactor (NAD+), substrate (2-oxoglutarate) or inhibitor (oxalylglycine, a substrate analogue) with final concentrations (per drop) of 5­10 mM. Polycrystals with a flower-like shape grew within 10­15 days to approximate dimensions of 0.7 · 0.4 · 0.4 mm. The crystals were split with the help of a thin needle or scalpel and were cryo-cooled in a nitrogen stream (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, UK) after immersion in a cryoprotectant solution [25­30% (w / v) PEG, 0.3 M salt (sodium or lithium acetate) and 10­15% (v / v) glycerol for 5­10 min. Heavy metal derivatization was conducted by soaking native crystals in a cryoprotectant solution containing 2­10 mM of the heavy metals for 10­15 h.

Data collection and processing
Diffraction data were collected at the synchrotron beamline BW6 (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) at a crystal temperature ° of 100 K. The crystals diffracted to 1.98 A and belong to the hexagonal crystal system with cell dimensions of a ¼ ° ° b ¼ 67.49 A and c ¼ 312.78 A. Data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK [45]. The Matthews coef° ficient of 2.58 A3ÆDa)1 indicated a solvent content of 52% and one molecule per asymmetric unit. MAD data at the Ta L-III edge were collected from a Ta6Br12 crystal deriv° ative to a resolution of 2.79 A (space group P622 or P6x22 ° ° with cell dimensions of a ¼ b ¼ 66.98 A and c ¼ 315.25 A) and processed and scaled with XDS [46].

Structure determination and model refinement
Patterson search techniques were performed with a search model comprising a truncated poly(Ala) chain with secondary structural elements conserved among the available structures of the D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase protein family members. The search model accounted to approximately 50% of the scattering power. The program AMORE ° [29] was used with data from 15 to 4 A and all six possible space groups (P622 and P61)522) were tested. For phase combination, first, the replacement model was subjected to a rigid body refinement against the MAD data using CNS [47] and model phases were calculated with REFMAC 5 [48]. Second, an anomalous Fourier map using the difference

structure factor amplitudes from the MAD data set and the model phases showed the anomalous scatterers at the correct positions and as positive peaks. This confirmed the principal correctness of the replacement solution including the right choice of the space group (P6122). Prior to this, two Ta6Br12 clusters were localized with the help of RSPS [49] and a MLPHARE-based script ([50]; search performed ° along the z-axis), and experimental phases (to 5 A resolution) were calculated with SHARP [51]. Finally, experimental and model phases were combined and the autobuilding routine of ARP / WARP [52] was used to improve and expand the phases to the full resolution of the native data ° set (1.98 A). Model building was done with MAIN [53] and structure refinement was performed with CNS and REFMAC 5 in the final stages of refinement. Water molecules were added where the electron density exceeded 3.0 r on |Fobs| ­ |Fcalc| electron density difference maps using ARP / WARP [52]. The atomic coordinates and structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1XDW) and will be released upon publication.
