Abstract Ten cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes isolated from midguts and fat bodies of control and allelochemical-induced fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) larvae were tested for their activity toward 13 model substrates belonging to halogenated compounds, nitro compounds, a; b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and organic hydroperoxides. Based on the pattern of activity toward these substrates, these GST isozymes exhibited different but overlapping substrate specificities. With a few exceptions, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was the best substrate for these isozymes. The isozymes were active toward numerous toxic a; b-unsaturated carbonyl allelochemicals including trans-2-octenal, trans-2nonenal, 2,4-hexadienal, trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal, trans,trans-2,4-nonadienal, and trans,trans-2,4-decadienal, suggesting that GSTs play an important role in the feeding strategies of lepidopterous insects. These GSTs also possessed glutathione peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide and conjugating activity toward 4-hydroxy nonenal, a lipid peroxidation product, and therefore they are antioxidant enzymes. Microsomal glutathione S-transferase from fat bodies of fall armyworm larvae metabolized a variety of model substrates such as CDNB, 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB), p-nitrophenyl acetate, and cumene hydroperoxide, but had no activity toward a; b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. With the exception of ethacrynic acid, glutathione S-transferase activities toward these substrates were all inducible by allelochemicals such as xanthotoxin and indole 3-acetonitrile in midguts and fat bodies of fall armyworm larvae. Induction ranged from 1.3- to 20.2-fold for midgut GSTs and 1.4- to 48.8-fold for fat body GSTs, depending on the inducer and substrate used. In all instances, DCNB-conjugating activity was most inducible based on percentage of control. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

that catalyze the conjugation of reduced glutathione (GSH) with various xenobiotics and endogenous compounds possessing an electrophilic center [1]. GSTs are important in phase I metabolism of organophosphorus and organochlorine compounds and play a significant role in resistance to these insecticides in insects [2­5]. They are also important in phase II metabolism of reactive metabolites formed by microsomal oxidation [6]. Recently, GSTs were found to be involved in pyrethroid tolerance through sequestration [7] and pyrethroid resistance through antioxidant defense [8] in insects. Insect glutathione S-transferases have been shown to be active toward numerous electrophilic xenobiotics including halogenated compounds (e.g., 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene), nitro compounds (e.g., p-nitrophenyl acetate), a; bunsaturated carbonyl compounds (e.g., trans-4phenyl-3-buten-2-one), isothiocyanates (e.g., allyl isothiocyanate), organothiocyanates (e.g., benzyl thiocyanate), oxides (e.g., styrene oxide), organophosphates (e.g., diazinon), and organic hydroperoxides (cumene hydroperoxide) [3]. However, very little is known about substrate specificity of individual GST isozymes in insects. This knowledge is very important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of detoxification in insects. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to study the substrate specificity of various GST isozymes isolated from midguts and fat bodies of fall armyworm larvae. Attempts also were made to learn if substrate specificity of glutathione Stransferases changes during larval development and after induction.

tonitrile, cumene hydroperoxide, and sodium pyruvate (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO); trans-4phenyl-3-buten-2-one (TPBO), 2,4-hexadienal, trans,trans-2,4-heptadienal, trans,trans-nonadienal, trans,trans-decadienal, trans-2-octenal, trans2-nonenal (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI); 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB); and p-nitrophenyl acetate (Eastern Kodak, Rochester, NY). All other chemicals were the highest purity available commercially. 2.3. Treatment of insects In induction experiments, groups of 25 larvae (newly molted sixth instars) were individually fed an artificial diet containing allelochemicals for 2 days prior to enzyme preparation. Control larvae were fed the artificial diet only. 2.4. Enzyme preparation Groups of midguts and fat bodies were dissected from 2-day-old sixth instars. In the case of midguts, gut contents were removed. All tissues were then washed in 1.15% KCl and homogenized in 25 ml of ice-cold 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, in a motor-driven tissue grinder for 30 s. The crude homogenate was filtered through cheese cloth and filtered homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000gmax for 15 min in a Beckman L550E ultracentrifuge. The pellet (cell debris, nuclei, and mitochondria) was discarded and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 105,000gmax for 1 h to obtain the soluble fraction (supernatant). In some experiments, fat body microsomes (pellet) were washed twice with 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, by recentrifigation at 105,000gmax for 1 h. The washed microsomes were finally suspended in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. 2.5. Purification of cytosolic glutathione S-transferases Glutathione S-transferases were purified from the soluble fraction according to a method described previously [10,11]. Briefly, the soluble fraction was first fractionated with ammonium sulfate to obtain a protein fraction that corresponded to 45­75% saturation. Precipitated proteins were suspended in 22 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and dialyzed against 250 vol of the same buffer for 2 h to eliminate the minute amount of ammonium sulfate in the preparation. The dialyzed sample was then applied to a thiol-linked

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Insects Larvae of the fall armyworm. Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), were reared on an artificial diet [9] and maintained in environmental chambers at 25 °C with a 16:8 light:dark photoperiod. 2.2. Chemicals The chemicals (analytical grade) used in this study and their sources were glutathione­agarose (thiol linked), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CD NB), ethacrynic acid, xanthotoxin, indole 3-ace-

glutathione­agarose column (1 Â 10 cm) previously equilibrated with 22 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was eluted with the same buffer until no further protein was detected by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm with an ISCO Model UA-5 absorbance/fluorescence detector. The bound enzyme was then released by eluting with 0.05 M Tris­HCl buffer, pH 9.6, containing 5 mM GSH. Fractions containing GST activity toward CDNB were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration on an Amicon Diaflo PM-10 membrane. GST isozymes were separated using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis as described below. All samples were stored at À70 °C for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford [12] using bovine serum albumin as standard. 2.6. Enzyme assays Glutathione S-transferase activities toward CDNB and DCNB were measured as reported previously [13]. GST activity toward p-nitrophenyl acetate was determined by the method of Keen and Jakoby [14]. GST activities toward ethacrynic acid and trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one were measured as described by Habig et al. [15]. GST activities toward trans,trans-2,4-alkadienals and trans-2-alkenals were measured by the method of Brophy et al. [16]. GST activity toward 4-hydroxy nonenal was assayed as described by Alin et al. [17]. GST peroxidase activity was determined using a method slightly modified from that of Ahmad and Pardini [18] using cumene hydroperoxide as substrate. Briefly, the 2.9-ml reaction mixture which contained 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSH, 0.2 mM NADPH, and 10 U glutathione reductase was first incubated for 3 min at 25 °C, followed by the addition of 20 ll cumene hydyroperoxide solution (prepared in methyl Cellosolve) to yield 1.2 mM final concentration. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1 ml of the enzyme. The rate of NADPH oxidation was recorded at 340 nm against the same reaction mixture in the absence of enzyme in a Beckman Model 5260 UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described by Berstein and Everse [19]. 2.7. Electrophoresis Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was conducted according to the

method of Davis [20]. The 10-cm separating gel contained 7.5% acrylamide and the 1-cm stacking gel contained 3% acrylamide. Electrophoresis was carried out at 2 mA/gel at 4 °C. Two gel tubes were stained briefly with a solution containing 3.5% perchloric acid and 0.04% Coomassie brilliant blue G [21] and used as references to locate and remove the protein bands from the nonstaining gels. GST isozymes were eluted from the appropriate gel sections containing protein bands using a Bio-Rad Model 422 electro-eluter according to manufacturerÕs instructions (Bio-Rad). Occasionally, the gels were stained for proteins with Coomassie brilliant blue R according to Fairbank et al. [22]. 2.8. Kinetic studies The Michaelis constant ðKm Þ and maximum velocity (Vmax ) for purified GST isozymes were determined by Lineweaver­Burk plots using CDNB (0.1­0.8 mM) as substrate. 2.9. Statistical analysis Whenever appropriate, data were analyzed by StudentÕs t test.

3. Results In previous reports [10,23], fall armyworm larval midgut was found to possess six cytosolic GST isozymes, namely, MG GST-1, MG GST-2, MG GST-3, MG GST-4, MG GST-5, and MG GST-6, whereas the fat body contained three isozymes, namely, FB GST-1, FB GST-2, and FB GST-3. In the present study, substrate specificity of these isozymes was determined using 13 model substrates belonging to halogenated compounds, nitro compounds, a; b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and organic hydroperoxides. Data in Table 1 show that the pattern of activity toward these substrates was different among isozymes. MG GST-3 was not active toward p-nitrophenyl acetate, whereas MG GST-4 was not active toward TPBO. Furthermore, DCNB-conjugating activity was not detected in any of these isozymes. In most instances, CDNB was the best substrate among those tested. The purifications were 4- to 294-fold, depending on the isozyme and substrate used. The substrate specificity of GST isozymes from fat bodies is shown in Table 2. Due to the poor

resolution between FB GST-2 and FB GST-3, combined activity was measured for these two isozymes as FB GST2/3. As found in the MG GSTs, the pattern of activity toward these substrates was different between isozymes. No activity was detected against DCNB, p-nitrophenyl acetate, and ethacrynic acid for FB GST-1. In the case of FB GST-2/3, no activity was detected toward DCNB. The results also showed that CDNB was the best substrate for these isozymes, followed by cumene hydroperoxide and 4-hydroxy nonenal. The purifications ranged from 7- to 230-fold, depending on the isozyme and substrate used.

We previously showed that induction of glutathione S-transferases by xanthotoxin in fall armyworm larvae resulted in production of two new cytosolic isozymes (FB GST-A and FB GST-B) in fat bodies [23]. Table 3 shows that these two induced GST isozymes from fat bodies exhibited different catalytic pattern toward these substrates. However, for both isozymes, ethacrynic acid was the best substrate, followed by CDNB and cumene hydroperoxide, and no activity was detected toward DCNB or trans-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one. Table 4 shows the activities of microsomal glutathione S-transferase prepared from fat

bodies of fall armyworm larvae. In this experiment, the second wash of microsomes removed all detectable traces of cytosolic contamination as indicated by an absence of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the preparation (data not shown). It can be seen that, in addition to CDNB, the microsomal GST was active toward DCNB, pnitrophenyl acetate, and cumene hydroperoxide, but had no activity against a; b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Attempts were made to learn

whether microsomal GST activity could be activated by a sulfhydryl reagent in fall armyworm larvae. Washed microsomes from fat bodies were incubated with N-ethylmaleimide at 1 mM for 10 min at 25 °C prior to addition of GSH and CDNB for the GST assay. The results showed that N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM) significantly inhibited GST activity (30% reduction) compared with the control. Using the midgut soluble fraction as the enzyme source, we found that the pattern of GST activities toward various substrates was slightly different among 4th, 5th, and 6th instar (Table 5). In all instances, CDNB was the best substrate for each instar, however. It is interesting to note that there is a positive correlation between the enzyme activity (toward CDNB and p-nitrophenyl acetate) and the instar. On the other hand, a negative correlation was observed between the enzyme activity (toward ethacrynic acid and trans-2-nonenal) and the instar. The results obtained from the induction of GSTs by allelochemicals in midguts and fat bodies of fall armyworm larvae are summarized in Tables 6 and 7. From Table 6, it is seen that xanthotoxin induced GST activities toward all substrates with the exception of ethacrynic acid, trans-4-phenyl-3buten-2-one, and trans-2-nonenal. In the case of indole 3-acetonitrile, it induced GST activities toward all substrates except ethacrynic acid. In all instances, DCNB-conjugating activity was most inducible based on percentage of control. Induction ranged from 1.3- to 20.2-fold depending on

4. Discussion The results of this study clearly demonstrated that the 10 GST isozymes isolated from fall armyworm larvae were different catalytically based on the order of substrate specificity toward 12 substrates as summarized in Table 9. DCNBconjugating activity was not included here because activity toward this substrate was not detected. These isozymes exhibited different but overlapping substrate specificities. With a few exceptions, CDNB was the best substrate among those employed. Thus, CDNB can be used as a general substrate for measuring GST activity in insects. These isozymes were active toward the a; b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The results are in agreement with Wadleigh and Yu [24] who found that several a; b-unsaturated carbonyl allelochemicals including trans-cinnamaldehyde, benzaldehyde, trans, trans-2,4-decadienal, and trans-2-hexenal were metabolized by cytosolic GSTs from fall armyworm larvae. These a; b-unsaturated carbonyl allelochemicals are commonly presented in corn, wheat, and oats [25­27], all of which are preferred host plants for the fall armyworm. Our results showed that, in addition to these toxic allelochemicals, numerous other a; b-

unsaturated carbonyl allelochemicals including trans-2-octenal, trans-2-nonenal, 2,4-hexadienal, trans, trans-heptadienal, trans, trans-2,4-nonadienal, and trans, trans-2,4-decadienal were also metabolized by the enzymes. The present findings further support the notion that GSTs play an important role in the feeding strategies of lepidopterous insects. In the present study, we were unable to detect GST activity toward DCNB for all of the purified isozymes. However, DCNB-conjugating activity was observed in the affinity-purified preparations [28], indicating that GSH­agarose was capable of retaining the enzyme during chromatography. It is highly possible that low yields of enzyme coupled with low specific activity resulted in undetectable quantities of the enzyme. Interestingly, all of the purified cytosolic GST isozymes possessed glutathione peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide and conjugating activity toward 4-hydroxy nonenal, the latter being a cytotoxic product of microsomal lipid peroxidation. The results indicated that all these GST isozymes are antioxidant enzymes. The lipid peroxidation products formed by the free-radicalmediated attack on membrane lipids can lead to membrane destruction and DNA damage [29,30]. Therefore, the detoxification of lipid peroxidation products is an essential process in animals. Cumene hydroperoxide peroxidase activity was detected in the cabbage looper, southern armyworm, and black swallowtail and has been characterized as GSTs with peroxidase activity [31]. Moreover, a GST isolated from Drosophila exhibited high activity toward 4-hydroxy nonenal

further illustrating the antioxidant capacity of these enzymes [32]. Previously, we reported no quantitative difference in GST isozyme composition (i.e., same number of isozymes) during larval development of fall armyworm [11]. The present study indicated that changes in levels of these GST isozymes may have occurred during development because a slight difference in substrate specificity was observed among the larval instars examined. In previous work [23], we showed that induction of GSTs by xanthotoxin and indole 3-acetonitrile in fall armyworm larvae resulted in the production of two non-constitutive isozymes in fat bodies. This is reflected in the present study showing different activity patterns in both groups of induced GSTs as compared with the control (Table 7). Although xanthotoxin did not induce any new isozyme in midguts of fall armyworm larvae [23], slight changes in levels of the existing isozymes did occur based on activity patterns of these GSTs (Table 6). It is interesting to note that GST antioxidant activities (toward 4-hydroxy nonenal and cumene hydroperoxide) were also inducible by allelochemicals in midguts and fat bodies of fall armyworm larvae. Therefore, induction of GSTs by allelochemicals will also help

insects detoxify endogenous lipid peroxidation products. However, we were perplexed to learn that GST activity toward ethacrynic acid was not induced by the allelochemicals in midguts and fat bodies of fall armyworm larvae. Our results showed that microsomal GST from fat bodies exhibited a narrower substrate specificity as compared with fat body cytosolic GSTs, showing no activity toward a; b-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Similar results were also obtained with midgut microsomal GST of this insect [28]. However, because microsomal cytochrome P450 monooxygenases catalyze the transformation of xenobiotics to reactive metabolites (e.g., epoxides), microsomal GST which is immediately available in the microsomal membrane may be more important than the cytosolic GSTs in the detoxification of such reactive metabolites. Moreover, because both microsomal GSTs from larval midguts [28] and fat bodies possessed cumene hydroperoxide peroxidase activity, they are presumably important in the detoxification of microsomal membrane hydroperoxides generated during lipid peroxidation. Microsomal GST from rat liver was found to be activated by numerous sulfhydryl reagents including N-ethylmaleimide, indoacetamide [33] and

herbicides (chloranil, captan, and acrolein) [34]. As found in midgut microsomal GST from fall armyworm larvae [28], in the present study fat body microsomal GST was not stimulated by N-ethylmaleimide, indicating that this GST is different from liver microsomal GST. In the case of rat liver microsomal GST, the activation involves the binding of one molecule of N-ethylmaleimide to the single cysteine residue present in each polypeptide chain of the enzyme [35]. Microsomal GST from fat bodies and midguts of fall armyworm larvae may not contain the cysteine residue for such interaction. Additional work is needed to verify this point. Since N-ethylmaleimide is a known GSH depleter [36], it may explain the inhibitory effect of this compound on microsomal GST activity observed in the fall armyworm.
