INTRODUCTION
ABSTRACT Dimeric dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD) catalyses the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPþ)-dependent oxidation of trans-dihydrodiols of aromatic hydrocarbons to their corresponding catechols. This is the first report of the crystal structure of the dimeric ° enzyme determined at 2.0 A resolution. The tertiary structure is formed by a classical dinucleotide binding fold comprising of two babab motifs at the N-terminus and an eightstranded, predominantly antiparallel b-sheet at the C-terminus. The active-site of DD, occupied either by a glycerol molecule or the inhibitor 4hydroxyacetophenone, is located in the C-terminal domain of the protein and maintained by a number of residues including Lys97, Trp125, Phe154, Leu158, Val161, Asp176, Leu177, Tyr180, Trp254, Phe279, and Asp280. The dimer interface is stabilized by a large number of intermolecular contacts mediated by the bsheet of each monomer, which includes an intricate hydrogen bonding network maintained in principal by Arg148 and Arg202. Site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated that the intact dimer is not essential for catalytic activity. The similarity between the quaternary structures of mammalian DD and glucose-fructose oxidoreductase isolated from the prokaryotic organism Zymomonas mobilis suggests that both enzymes are members of a unique family of oligomeric proteins and may share a common ancestral gene.

Multiple forms of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (DD, E.C. 1.3.1.20) have been identified, isolated, and enzymatically characterized in a number of mammalian species and tissues. This includes the eye, kidney, liver, and intestines from monkey, pig, dog, rabbit, and human tissue.1­5 Previous studies have identified monomeric forms of DD to be 3a- and 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases as well as aldehyde or aldose reductase, based on their comparative molecular size, substrate catabolism, and inhibition profiles.3,4 Isolated DDs of $65­72 kDa are biologically active dimeric proteins made up of two identical subunits of 32­36 kDa.2,5,6 They are distributed in tissues that are major sites of xenobiotic metabolism and are distinguished by their efficient oxidation of trans-dihydrodiols of aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene and benzene to their corresponding catechols, as well as a select number of pentoses and hexoses,5 utilizing NADPþ as cofactor. Dimeric DDs are also competent in the NADPH-driven reduction of a limited number of aldehyde and dicarbonyl compounds such as 3deoxyglucosone, camphorquinone, and 3-nitrobenzaldehyde.3,7,8 Recent cDNA cloning and sequencing studies have shown that dimeric DDs from Japanese monkey kidney, rabbit lens, dog, and pig livers, have a high degree of inter-species sequence similarity (82­ 94%) when compared to the human liver DD.1 Moreover, these experiments produced no sequence homology with monomeric DDs belonging to the superfamily of enzymes known as aldo-keto reductases (AKR), while alignment with sequences known as short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDR) showed no consensus active site sequences (Tyr-X-X-X-Lys), a defining trait in this family of enzymes.9­11

Dimeric Dihydrodiol Dehydrogenase

Dimeric DD does possess some low sequence similarity with over 20 proteins (14­25%) belonging to a number of prokaryotic, yeast and plant genes.1 Each of these proteins possesses a number of invariant residues (namely His79, Glu96, Lys97, and Pro98) and a larger number of highly conserved residue sequences between species. Of the number of possible gene products having sequence similarity with dimeric DD only one has been functionally and structurally characterized, the enzyme glucose-fructose oxidoreductase (GFO, E.C. 1.1.99.28) from Zymomonas mobilis.12­15 The GFO structure revealed a terminally-bound NADPþ in the N-terminal arm of the protein forming a classical dinucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal end comprising predominantly of a nine-stranded anti-parallel b-sheet. Structural analysis revealed the possible presence of a conserved structural motif of Glu-Lys-Pro in the active site, a feature that has also been isolated and identified in dimeric DD.1 Subsequent mutagenesis based on the GFO structure and a comparison of its sequence with that of dimeric DD from monkey kidney have identified conserved catalytic and dinucleotide-binding residues,16 characteristic of enzymes belonging to the same structural family. However, further information based on the crystal structure of dimeric DD would provide a better understanding and characterization of the functional nature of this nascent group of enzymes. In this study, we present the first crystal structure of a mammalian dimeric DD isolated from Japanese monkey (Macaca fascicularis) kidney solved using the Multiple Isomorphous Replacement ° (MIR) method and refined to a resolution of 2.0 A. The quaternary structure was found to display structural folding and amino acid sequence elements remarkably reminiscent to that of GFO from Z. mobilis, indicating that both proteins are members of a new and unique protein family of oxido-reductases.1 The crystal structure and putative mutagenesis has also revealed the residues crucial to the maintenance of a stable dimeric structure which in turn are integral to optimal enzymatic activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

NADPþ, 50 mM D-xylose, and enzyme, in a total volume of 2.0 mL. The activity of AKR1C14 (mouse 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase)17 was determined with 50 lM androsterone and 0.1M glycine-NaOH, pH 9.5, as the substrate and buffer, respectively. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyses the formation of 1 lmol of NADPH per minute at 258C.
Site-directed mutagenesis, expression, and purification

Mutagenesis was performed using a QuickChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and an expression pRset vector harboring the cDNA for monkey DD.1,16 The mutagenic primers were designed to produce the mutant enzymes of DD (R148A and R202A) by replacing the respective codons in the cDNA with an Ala codon, GCT. The cDNA for R148A/R202A was similarly prepared by replacing the codon for Arg-148 in the cDNA for R202A with GCT. The complete coding regions of the cDNAs were sequenced with a CEQ2000XL DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter) to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and to ensure that no other mutation had occurred. The wild-type and mutated cDNAs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the recombinant enzymes were purified from the 12,000g supernatants of the homogenates of the cells (each 500-mL culture) as described previously.1,16 The single mutant enzymes (R148A and R202A) were partially purified by the ammonium sulphate fractionation and chromatography on a Sephadex G-100 column (2.5 3 90 cm) using the buffers supplemented with 20% glycerol. The WT and double mutant enzyme (R148A/R202A) were further purified by chromatography on a Red Sepharose column (1.5 3 5 cm), in which both enzymes were eluted with the buffer containing 0.5 mM NADPþ. The enzyme fractions were concentrated to more than 0.5 mg/mL by ultrafiltration. Homogeneous AKR1C14 was prepared as described previously.17 The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford18 using bovine serum albumin as a standard.
Crystallization and data collection

Cofactors (NADPH and NADPþ) and chemicals of the highest purity were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, Fluka and MERCK. Crystallization buffers and kits were purchased from Hampton Research.
Assay of enzyme activity

The dehydrogenase activity of monkey DD and its mutant enzymes was assayed by measuring the rate of change in NADPH fluorescence (at 455 nm with an excitation wavelength at 340 nm).16 The standard reaction mixture consisted of 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 mM

Initial attempts for crystallization of the DD complex (DD:NADPH) have been published.19 Briefly, DD enzyme solution (18.5 mg/mL; 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) was mixed with cofactor (NADPH) in a molar ratio of 1:4. Crystals were grown using droplets consisting of 3 lL of the DD/NADPH solution mixed with a matching volume containing 1.5M ammonium phosphate and 0.1M sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6). Crystals grew within 2 days to an average dimension of 0.6 3 0.15 3 0.15 mm3. Data were collected at 100 K from crystals flash-cooled in a cryoPROTEINS

protectant solution containing 2M ammonium phosphate and 0.1M sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6) and 20% glycerol at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 14-BM-C and processed using the programs HKL2000 and SCALEPACK20. The exposure time (30 s), oscillation range (0.58), and crystal-detector distance (120 mm) were adjusted to optimize the collection of a near complete ° data set to a resolution of 2.00 A. The inhibitor complex of DD was crystallized and used for heavy atom derivation since these crystals grew larger and their heavy-atom derivatives were more stable in the beam than those without inhibitor. Briefly, a solution of DD (19.72 mg/mL; 58.2 lL, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 48C) was mixed with cofactor (NADPþ, 2 lL, 9.16 mM) and the inhibitor 4hydroxyacetophenone (4OH, 0.4 lL, 47.38 mM) in a molar ratio of 1:4:4, for a final protein concentration of 17.28 mg/mL prior to crystallization. Each droplet consisted of 2 lL of the DD/NADPþ/4OH solution mixed with a matching volume of solution containing 2M ammonium sulphate, 0.1M sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.0). Crystals were obtained at 295 K on a 24-well tissue culture plate via the vapor diffusion method21 and grew within 24 h to an average dimension of 0.6 3 0.2 3 0.2 mm3. Derivatives for MIR analysis were prepared by soaking the crystals in the crystallization buffer containing solubilized heavy atom salts from the Hampton heavy-atom screen kit. Diffraction data from the enzyme-inhibitor complex and its heavy-atom derivatives were collected at 100 K from flash-cooled crystals in cryo-protectant containing 2M ammonium sulphate, 0.1M sodium citrate buffer (pH

5.0), and 20% glycerol using a mar345 detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode X-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. Each frame was recorded with an 1800 s exposure and a 1.08 oscillation around ø. The crystal to detector distance was set to 250 mm. The data was processed and scaled using the marHKL software package.20 Near-complete data sets were collected to a maxi° mum resolution of 2.59 A. All data collection and processing statistics are shown in Table I.
Multiple isomorphous replacement

The initial structure of DD was solved using the MIR method. Heavy-atom types, soaking conditions and data sets were tested and several were discarded because of crystal cracking or lack of isomorphism. Further analysis and the location of heavy-atom positions utilizing the difference Patterson function in the program CCP422 found that the best derivatives for phase calculation were the K2PtCl4-DD-derivative and the (C2H5)3Pb(CH3COO)2DD-derivative. The refinement of heavy-atom positions and the calculation of initial phases were carried out by MLPHARE with an overall mean figure of merit of 0.377 ° for data between 20 and 3.5 A resolution. Assuming a solvent content of 60%, solvent flattening was carried out ° using DM23 and significantly improved the map at 3.5 A to an overall mean figure of merit of 0.704.

in the Materials and Methods section and Table I. The model was built using a combination of automated structure matching techniques and manual fitting of loops and side-chains. The initial phases and resultant structural idealization revealed a mostly continuous polypeptide chain comprised of 313 amino acids including side-chains from a total of 334 amino acids with the majority of the missing residues located near the N and C-terminal ends. ° Refinement of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (2.59 A) ° and apoenzyme (2.00 A) structures produced final R-values (Rfree) of 22.78 and 19.33, respectively (Table II). The positions of the N-terminal methionine (Met1) and the two C-terminal residues (Lys333 and His334) were not determined in the crystal structure while the electron density maps showed that residues 2­332 were well defined. The biological dimer of DD sits on the crystallographic twofold axis and comprises of two identical protein subunits of 2 3 331 amino acids (Subunits A and B, Fig. 1). One molecule of glycerol and one molecule of 4-hydroxyacetophenone (4OH) are bound to the activesites of the apoenzyme and inhibitor complex, respectively. A covalently bound b-mercaptoethanol to a Cterminal cysteine (Cys253) is located adjacent to the active-site of the enzyme, while electron densities corresponding to the cofactor molecules NADPH and NADPþ molecules were absent and replaced with those corresponding to phosphate and sulphate ions in the apoenzyme and inhibitor complex structures, respectively. If

helix recognition software available in arp/warp.25 Visual inspection of the model and electron density map in XtalView26 suggested the folding of DD was very similar to that of GFO.15 The model of GFO (PDB code 1OFG) was used to guide the manual fitting of the secondary structure elements of DD, while the correct rotamer conformations of the amino acid side chains and loops were fitted by the molecular graphics program COOT.27 This initial molecular model was then subjected to structural refinement using REFMAC.28 Difference-Fourier maps (2Fo À Fc and Fo À Fc) were visualized in COOT27 and enabled the addition of bound substituents and water molecules. Final refinement statistics are listed in Table II for the apoenzyme and inhibitor complex structures.

Overall structural architecture of dimeric DD

This is the first report of a crystal structure for dimeric DD isolated from a mammalian species. A single subunit of DD (see Fig. 2) has two distinct domains. The N-terminal portion of the protein (residues 2­125) forms a classic dinucleotide (cofactor) binding motif32 of six b-strands (a­f) and four a-helices (a-1, a-2, a-4, and a-5). These two babab formations are linked and maintained by the exterior short helix of a-3. The refinement of DD did not reveal electron density for the cofactor and instead, both the inhibitor complex and apoenzyme structures have shown the presence of two bound sulphate and phosphate ions, respectively, in the proposed cofactor-binding site. Observations made by Asada et al.16 demonstrated the stimulatory effect of salts such as phosphate on DD activity and while the crystal structure of DD does not suggest the means by which this may occur, given the concentrations of the salt in the crystallization buffer far exceeds that of the cofactor, it is plausible that a level of competitive binding by phosphate and sulphate in preference to NADP(H) during crystallization has occurred. The larger C-terminal domain (residues 126­331) forms a predominantly anti-parallel b-sheet consisting of eight b-strands (A­H), creating the ``rigid'' backbone of the monomer, and six a-helices (a-6 ­

a-11). a-Helices 7, 9, and 11 make a number of hydrophobic contacts with the internal face of the C-terminal b-sheet of DD. The active-site or substrate-binding ° ° ° domain of the enzyme measures 13 A 3 13 A 3 9 A and is maintained by residues in the short helix of a-6, the N-terminal end of the centrally-positioned helix of a-9 and the short loop labeled f-1 (formed between bstrands F and G) and the relatively longer loop of f-2 (between b-strand H and the a-10 helix). ° ° The dimer measures approximately 102 A 3 49 A 3 ° 38 A. The total sum of the inter-subunit contacts within dimeric DD are mediated by the eight-stranded antiparallel b-sheet and loops of the C-terminus, in particular the long b-strands of A-D. The stacked nature of the bsheets closely mimic that of GFO with each external bstrand forming a vast number of polar and several apolar contacts, of which the most important being the hydrogen-bonding network formed by Arg148 and Asp210. ° Each residue forms two bonds (3.0 and 3.2 A) between Arg148 (NE and NH2) of Subunit A and Asp210 (OD1 and OD2, respectively) of subunit B (see Fig. 3). The proper orientation of the carboxylate of Asp210 for interaction with Arg148 is maintained via van der Waals con° tacts with the side chains of Thr211 (OG1: 2.7 A), ° ), and His204 (ND1: 2.8 A) while ° Thr231 (OG1: 2.8 A the side chain of Arg148 forms a close parallel stacking ° interaction with Arg202 (3.9 A) and hydrogen bond interactions with a phosphate ion (O1 and O4 are hydro° gen bonded to NH1 and NH2: 2.9 and 2.8 A, respectively). Sulphate ions in the inhibitor complex do not form a similar interaction with Arg148 where the phosphate is replaced by a single water molecule. An additional hydrogen bond interaction between the monomers occurs between the side-chain oxygen of Thr213 (OG1) on b-strand C and the side-chain nitrogen of His223 on ° b-strand D (NE2: 2.6 A), while a number of residues that form the short loops between the C-terminal bstrands are also in contact. This includes the side-chain nitrogen of Asn157 (ND2) and the main-chain carbonyl ° of Thr243 (O: 3.0 A), and the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser241 (OG) and the main-chain carbonyl of Gln233 ° (O: 2.8 A). The remaining, shorter b-strands of DD (b-strands E-H) do not make contact with the adjacent subunit, with a number of polar residues on the external face interacting with waters in a predominantly solventfilled open cavity. b-strands B and C expose residues Leu215 and Met200 from each monomer on its external surface to form a patchwork of closely associated - stacked apolar residues well hidden from any solvent interaction.
The catalytic domain of DD

Structural refinement of dimeric DD revealed the presence of a glycerol molecule, most likely sourced from the storage or cryogenic buffer containing 20% glycerol prior to diffraction, in the active-site of the enzyme, while the

inhibitor complex revealed continuous density for 4OH [represented in the omit maps shown in Fig. 4(a,b)]. The relative efficacy of 4OH as an inhibitor (IC50 ¼ 0.97 lM)33 for DD can be demonstrated by the numerous interactions it forms with active-site residues [Fig. 5(a)]. The hydroxyl group of 4OH forms hydrogen bond interactions with the side-chain oxygen (OD2) and the main ° chain nitrogen (N) of Asp280 (3.2 and 3.4 A, respec-

tively). The benzene ring and methyl group of 4OH make a number of hydrophobic contacts with Phe279, Leu158, and Leu177. Interestingly, the carbonyl oxygen of 4OH is within a hydrogen bond distance of a water molecule ° (H2O196; 2.5 A) which in turn forms a tight hydrogen bond interaction with the side-chain hydroxyl (OH) of ° Tyr180 (2.7 A). Glycerol is bound to the active-site of DD occupying the same area as 4OH, however making fewer side-chain interactions [Fig. 5(b)]. A hydroxyl oxygen of glycerol (O2) forms hydrogen bonds with the ° side-chain nitrogen (NZ) of Lys156 (2.70 A) and a water ° ), while another hydroxyl oxymolecule (H2O341; 3.2 A gen (O1) makes hydrogen bond interaction with two ° waters (H2O34 and 342; 3.0 and 2.7 A, respectively). Much like 4OH, a water in close association with a hydroxyl group of glycerol (H2O342) makes an additional hydrogen bond interaction with the side-chain hydroxyl ° of Tyr180 (2.6 A). It would seem that the effectiveness of glycerol and 4OH for binding successfully to the activesite of DD requires some degree of contact, either directly, or indirectly with the Tyr180. Indeed, sequence and structural superimposition of DD and GFO (see Fig. 6) reveals the presence of Tyr 217 in the same position within the putative active site (i.e. the N-terminal arm of the centrally-positioned helix a-9), suggesting a high level of conservation of this residue. Analysis of the residues ° within 5 A of the bound inhibitor suggests that the activesite domain of DD is maintained by Lys97, Trp125, Phe154, Leu158, Val161, Asp176, Leu177, Tyr180, Trp254, Phe279, and Asp280.

the active-site is indicative of the substrate specificity of DD for a number of aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene and benzene dihydrodiols.3,4
Destabilization of the dimer interface

The contribution of Arg148 and Arg202 to the subunit association of DD was assessed by comparing the molecular weights on Sephadex G-100 filtration analysis among the wild-type (WT), the enzymes with a single mutation (R148A and R202A) and double mutation (R148A/ R202A). The dehydrogenase activities of the R148A and R202A mutant forms (0.04 unit/mg) in the lysates of the E. coli cells were comparable to that of the WT (0.05 unit/mg), and like the WT, appeared at approximately 70 kDa on the gel filtration analysis using buffers with or without 20% glycerol while the activity of the R148A/ R202A mutant form in the E. coli lysate was low (0.015 unit/mg), and detectable only when using buffer containing glycerol. The enzyme peak was observed at the same position as a molecular marker enzyme, AKR1C1417 (36 kDa), although the recovery of its activity was low (10% of that of the E. coli extract), no activity was detected in the higher molecular weight fractions, suggesting that the enzyme dissociated into monomers, with a specific

activity of 1.2 units/mg. The same specific activity was observed when the enzyme was diluted 5- to 100-fold with the buffer containing 20% glycerol ruling out the possibility that a concentration-dependent equilibration between the inactive monomer and the formation of an active dimer taking place, which has been reported for other enzymes.35,36 The Km values of the purified R148A/R202A DD for D-xylose and NADPþ were 2-fold higher than the WT, while the Vmax value of the mutant enzyme was 3.7-fold lower than the WT. R148A/R202A DD displayed significant temperature sensitivity [Fig. 7(a)] while the single mutants of R148A and R202A, like the WT proved to be stable at 378C. The inactivation of the R148A/R202A mutant form was irreversible. No activity of the 378Cinactivated sample was recovered by the addition of 0.1 mM NADPþ and 40% glycerol, which showed partial and complete protective effects, respectively, against the inactivation at 258C [Fig. 7(b)]. The instability of R148A/R202A DD explains its low activity in the E. coli extract and Vmax value of the purified enzyme preparation, which probably contains inactive monomers. Thus, the dissociation of DD into the monomer largely affects the stability rather than catalytic activity. Therefore, stabilization of the dimeric complex is imperative for peak

enzymatic function and long term enzyme viability, and that monomer to monomer interactions are predominantly mediated by the association of Arg148­Arg202. The viability and dimeric nature of the single mutations suggest a compensatory hydrogen or van der Waals interaction by the remaining arginine with a number of polar residues at the protein surface from the adjacent monomer, including Asp146, Asp210, Glu221, and Thr243.
DD and other structurally related proteins

The overall b-sheet and a-helix topology of DD and GFO monomers and dimers are similar (Figs. 6 and 8) with the majority of differences related to the length of several a-helices and b-strands and through the irregular loops between them, most distinctively those loops that define the active-site domain. Another striking difference is the relative shortness of b-strands E­H when compared to the corresponding b-strands in GFO, a consequence of GFO forming a tight, extended, biologically active tetramer, hydrogen-bonded by the last strands in

each C-terminal domain in an antiparallel fashion.15 In addition to this, the N-terminal arm of GFO (residues 1­ 31), which is distinctively absent from DD, forms a tight association with an adjacent subunit most likely to establish oligomer stability and tetramer formation, and to also ensure tight, non-dissociable cofactor binding. Inspection and superimposition of the biological dimer of DD with GFO shows a strong structural resemblance which belies its poor sequence similarity (R.M.S.D. 2.611, Figs. 6 and 8).37 This lack of sequence to structure correlation is not unique as exemplified by sequence analysis studies of dimeric DD's1 which did not reveal a consensus sequence (Gly-X-Gly-X-X-Ala) indicative of the presence of a Rossmann fold for cofactor binding,38 yet this feature is clearly evident in the crystal structure. Moreover, close inspection of the superimposed proteins along with sequence alignment analysis have revealed the importance and conservation of several key residues in relation to cofactor and substrate binding. This includes Tyr180, the N-terminal motif of Glu-Lys-Pro (residues 96­98 in DD and residues 127­129 in GFO) and His79

(His111 in GFO). The N-terminal motif typically interacts with the nicotinamide and ribose rings of NADPþ in GFO15 and is located on the loop region between bstrands e and a-helix 5 in DD. Mutation of His79 (to Gln79) has shown an increase of the kinetic constants (Kd and Km) for NADPH16 and when superimposed with GFO may suggest an interaction with the ribose sugar of NADPH. Previous mutagenesis experiments have also depicted the abrogation of DD activity when Tyr180 is mutated to Phe,16 indicating that Tyr180 (and most likely Tyr217 for GFO) is indeed a catalytic residue that forms part of a proton relay - hydrogen transfer system. This residue may also act as a putative substratebinding site, enabling its capacity for the donation of a hydrogen atom from the side-chain hydroxyl during catalysis, which is a common function for active-site Tyr amongst SDR enzymes.10,11 Kingston et al.15 also suggested that Lys129 may enable substrate binding by facilitating hydrogen bond transfer to Tyr217 in GFO and the conservation of this residue (see Fig. 6) in the active-site of DD (Lys97) may be indicative of this role during catalysis. To identify proteins with similar architecture to DD, the available coordinates of published structures that display a structural similarity to GFO were compared by superimposition with that of DD (Table III). This included 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose reductase39 (AFR) from Sinorhizobium morelense and rat biliverdin reductase40 (BVR). Like GFO, both of these enzymes, in particular AFR, exhibited striking topological similarity with DD (R.M.S.D 1.962 and 2.358, respectively) with each enzyme possessing a similarly small dinucleotide-binding domain for NADPH and a C-terminal of predominantly anti-parallel b-sheet. The secondary structure differences exist in the C-terminal domain, where BVR forms a smaller six-stranded b-sheet with an external face that is highly polar, indicative of the monomeric nature of the enzyme, while AFR has a similar sized C-terminal, antiparallel b-sheet to that of DD made up of a number of polar and apolar residues. This allows AFR a limited ability to be able to form oligomers in vitro and is displayed

in the crystal structure of the enzyme which forms a major number of contacts between monomers, much like the dimer of DD and the tetramer of GFO. However, unlike DD, AFR lacks the highly ordered Arg148-Arg202 inter-subunit interaction and this may explain the tentative nature of the dimeric complex in vitro. The catalytic Tyr of DD and GFO is replaced in AFR by a His (His180) as demonstrated by sequence alignment of the three proteins (see Fig. 6), with site-directed mutagenesis indicating a similar role as active-site Tyr in substrate binding and catalysis.38 Moreover, mutagenesis has also demonstrated clearly that the active-site Lys94 in AFR (corresponding to Lys97 and Lys129 in DD and GFO, respectively) is involved in substrate binding by adversely affecting the kcat for the enzymatic reaction and lends credence to the postulated role for the residue in enzyme catalysis in DD. BVR lacks the cofactor-linked Glu-Lys-Pro motif of DD, GFO and AFR, perhaps due to its concomitant binding of NADH and NADPH and while BVR possesses an active-site Tyr (Tyr97) it is not essential for catalysis. DISCUSSION Our results invariably show that mammalian dimeric DDs are members of a new and distinct phylogenetic family of oxido-reductases that are larger in size than most members (230­250 residues) of the SDR superfamily,9­11 form tertiary structures that are distinctively different to the well characterized, biologically monomeric (a/b)8-TIM barrel motifs of the AKR superfamily of enzymes41­43 and are readily derived from mammalian, prokaryotic, yeast, and plant genes. To this end, we would designate these proteins as members of a new family of dimeric oxido-reductases. Regardless of the largely divergent amino acid sequence, tertiary structure analysis revealed that DD and GFO have a highly homologous secondary structure (see Fig. 8). In addition to the striking structural similarity and in conjunction with our mutagenesis experiments, those undertaken by Asada et al.16 and the GFO structural observations by Kingston et al.,15 we have observed further similarities, including monomer-subunit interactions that are maintained predominantly via a C-terminal

antiparallel b-sheet, a propensity for successful enzymatic activity dependent on its higher order dimeric structure (tetramer formation with regards to GFO) and a catalytic mechanism utilizing a hydrogen-proton delivery system involving active-site Tyr and Lys residues. These observations are strongly indicative of the probable evolutionary divergence of DD, a mammalian enzyme and GFO, an enzyme predominantly active within the hydrophobic environment of the periplasm of Z.mobilis15 from a common ancestral gene or structural precursor. This nascent group of enzymes may also include monomeric subfamilies of similar folding with subtle differences in the use of catalytic residues involved in proton transfer and for now includes the bacterial enzyme AFR and the mammalian enzyme BVR. Mutagenesis experiments have also shown that the biological dimer of DD is not essential in initiating catalytic activity and instead is essential in sustaining optimal functionality over time for the enzyme. This would be the case as the mutated residues of Arg148 and Arg202 are well away from the active-site and present no direct hydrogen-bonding network in connection to the activesite residues. Therefore, they would produce no immediate effect, where normally monomers formed via mutagenesis from higher oligomers produce an immediate downgrade or abrogation of activity.35,36,44 The true nature of the role for Arg148 and Arg202 maybe determined from the gross secondary structure of the dimer. Arginine 148 and Arginine 202 are positioned at the base and apex of b-strands A and B, respectively, and represent the tightest association between the monomers in the dimeric complex. The loss of DD's viability must therefore be a consequence of the loss of stabilization and rigidity of the inter-subunit C-terminal b-sheet association which in turn mediates a number of hydrophobic contacts via its internal face with structural elements including a-helix 9 which forms a portion of the active-site. The exposed surface of the monomeric DD may be prone to aggregation due to the exposure of several hydrophobic residues to solvent and as seen in our experiments, the addition of glycerol [Fig. 7(b)] does help stabilize and even rescue enzyme activity and may therefore aid in maintaining the hydrophobic interactions mediated by the b-sheet. The role of the C-terminus in enzyme stability is demonstrated by the fact that the addition of NADPþ had no great effect on the mutant enzyme thereby indicating that stabilization of the N-terminal dinucleotide-binding domain was inconsequential. Sequence alignment analysis by Arimitsu et al.1 has also demonstrated that this mechanism of inter-subunit interaction by Arg148 and Arg202 and the hydrogen-bonding network of additional side-chains are maintained amongst all mammalian DDs thus far identified. This level of conservation strongly suggests that dimerization is equally important with regards to functionality amongst all mammalian DDs.

CONCLUSIONS We have described the first crystal structure of mam° malian dimeric DD at a resolution of 2.00 A. The enzyme has a distinct structure previously seen in a number of related prokaryotic and one mammalian enzyme of exceptionally different sequence homology and possessing various states of oligomerization. We have also demonstrated that the maintenance of the dimeric structure required a unique hydrogen bonding network of polar residues, at the heart of which included the stacked interaction of two arginine residues which seem to be wholly responsible for long-term enzyme activity and structural stability. Further characterization of this enzyme family is necessary if we are to accurately depict and track the evolution of proteins and their structures and function from prokaryotes to higher order mammals. However, given that a defining trait among these enzymes seems to be a lack of sequence homology, discovering these enzymes may come about only via threedimensional structural analysis.
