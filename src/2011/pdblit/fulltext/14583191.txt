Glycine N-methyltransferase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine: glycine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.20; GNMT) catalyzes the AdoMet-dependent methylation of glycine to form sarcosine (N-methylglycine). Unlike most methyltransferases, GNMT is a tetrameric protein showing a positive cooperativity in AdoMet binding and weak inhibition by S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The ®rst crystal structure of GNMT complexed with AdoMet showed a unique ``closed'' molecular basket structure, in which the N-terminal section penetrates and corks the entrance of the adjacent subunit. Thus, the apparent entrance or exit of the active site is not recognizable in the subunit structure, suggesting that the enzyme must possess a second, enzymatically active, ``open'' structural conformation. A new crystalline form of the R175K enzyme has been grown in the presence of an excess of AdoHcy, and its crystal structure has been Ê determined at 3.0 A resolution. In this structure, the N-terminal domain (40 amino acid residues) of each subunit has moved out of the active site of the adjacent subunit, and the entrances of the active sites are now opened widely. An AdoHcy molecule has entered the site occupied in the ``closed'' structure by Glu15 and Gly16 of the N-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit. An AdoHcy binds to the consensus AdoMet binding site observed in the other methyltransferase. This AdoHcy binding site supports the glycine binding site (Arg175) deduced from a chemical modi®cation study and site-directed mutagenesis (R175K). The crystal Ê structures of WT and R175K enzymes were also determined at 2.5 A resolution. These enzyme structures have a closed molecular basket structure and are isomorphous to the previously determined AdoMet-GNMT structure. By comparing the open structure to the closed structure, mechanisms for auto-inhibition and for the forced release of the product AdoHcy have been revealed in the GNMT structure. The N-terminal section of the adjacent subunit occupies the AdoMet binding site and thus inhibits the methyltransfer reaction, whereas the same N-terminal section forces the departure of the potentially potent inhibitor AdoHcy from the active site and thus facilitates the methyltransfer reaction. Consequently GNMT is less active at a low level of AdoMet concentration, and is only weakly inhibited by AdoHcy. These properties of GNMT are particularly suited for regulation of the cellular AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio.

Auto-inhibition and Forced Product Release Mechanisms in GNMT

Keywords: glycine N-methyltransferase; enzyme structure; X-ray diffraction; auto-inhibition mechanism; forced product release mechanism

Introduction
Biological methylation reactions utilizing S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl donor are widespread in nature, and participate in a wide variety of cellular processes through methylation of nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, and small molecules. AdoMet is transformed to S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy), a potent inhibitor of most methyltransferases. The activities of methyltransferases are largely regulated in vivo by the cellular concentration ratio of AdoMet to AdoHcy (Heady & Kerr, 1973). Glycine N-methyltransferase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine: glycine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.20; GNMT) is an abundant enzyme in the cytosol of liver cells (Heady & Kerr, 1973). It catalyzes the AdoMet-dependent methylation of glycine to form sarcosine (N-methylglycine) and to produce AdoHcy. Unlike most methyltransferases, GNMT is less active at low AdoMet concentrations, and is only weakly inhibited by AdoHcy (Kerr & Heady, 1974). Since sarcosine has no known physiological role, it has been suggested that the major role of GNMT is to regulate the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio rather than to synthesize sarcosine (Ogawa & Fujioka, 1982a; Wagner et al., 1985; Cook et al., 1989; Balaghi et al., 1993). In addition to its enzymatic role, GNMT has been shown to be a major folate binding protein in rat liver cytosol (Cook & Wagner, 1984), and more recently, to be a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-binding protein (Raha et al., 1994) and a mediator of cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression (Raha et al., 1995). The 3D structures of 11 AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, HhaI DNA methyltransferase (Cheng et al., 1993), catechol O-methyltransferase (Vidgren et al., 1994), TaqI DNA methyltransferase (Labahn et al., 1994), HaeIII DNA methyltransferase (Reinisch et al., 1995), glycine N-methyltransferase (Fu et al., 1996), mRNA cap speci®c RNA 2H -Omethyltransferase (Hodel et al., 1996), PvuII DNA methyltransferase (Gong et al., 1997), CheR protein methyltransferase (Djordjevic & Stock, 1997), ErmAM rRNA methyltransferase (Yu et al., 1997), ErmCH rRNA methyltransferase (Bussiere et al., 1998), and DpnM DNA methyltransferase (Tran et al., 1998) are known. Although no extensive sequence homologies exist among methyltransferases, the tertiary structures of the AdoMet binding domains of these methyltransferases are strikingly similar to each other, suggesting that many methyltransferases may have a common structure (Schluckebier et al., 1995). Although the structure of the AdoMet binding domain of GNMT is very similar to the corresponding domains of other

methyltransferases, an additional domain found only in GNMT encloses the active site to form a molecular basket, and consequently the overall structure of GNMT is quite different from the structures of other methyltransferases (Fu et al., 1996). The crystal structure shows no apparent entrance or exit opening or channel for the substrate and product, suggesting that a different conformation of GNMT may produce catalysis in solution. The binding site and orientation of the AdoMet molecule in the GNMT crystal structure is quite different from those of the other methyltransferase complexes. In the GNMT structure, the consensus AdoMet binding site observed in other methyltransferases is occupied by the amino acid residues from an adjacent subunit (Takusagawa et al., 1999). Furthermore, the binding site and orientation of AdoMet molecule in the crystal structure does not support the location of the glycine binding site (Arg175) that was deduced from chemical modi®cation (Konishi & Fujioka, 1987) and site-directed mutagenesis studies (Y.T. & M.F., unpublished data). These discrepancies indicate a possibility that the AdoMet molecule observed in the crystal structure of AdoMet-GNMT was simply trapped during puri®cation and crystallization periods. Thus, its location may not identify the actual catalytic site, i.e. the AdoMet-GNMT structure may well be that of an enzymatically inactive complex. Therefore we have searched for a crystal structure containing an enzymatically active AdoMet-GNMT complex. Here we report a new crystal structure of a mutant enzyme R175K, which has Lys instead of Arg175, complexed with AdoHcy, along with the crystal structures of free WT and R175K. The bound AdoHcy molecule occupies the consensus binding site, consistent with structures of other methyltransferases, and its location also agrees with chemical modi®cation and mutagenesis studies. With this new structure, we can also now explain why GNMT shows sigmoidal kinetics toward AdoMet (but not glycine), and is less strongly inhibited by AdoHcy than other methyltransferases.

Results
The crystallographic re®nement parameters (Table 1), ®nal (2Fo À Fc) maps and conformational analysis by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) indicate that the crystal structures of WT, R175K and AdoHcy-R175K have been determined successfully.

Structures of WT and R175K The overall structures of WT and R175K are quite similar to the AdoMet-GNMT structure previously determined (Fu et al., 1996) except for the empty active site. Especially notable is that the structures of WT and R175K are essentially the Ê same (rmsd  0.27 A), indicating that the R175K mutation does not affect polypeptide folding. Thus, we take the structure of the AdoHcy-R175K to represent closely the structure of the wild-type AdoHcy-GNMT complex except for Lys instead of Arg at position 175. The structure of WT obtained in this study agrees with that previously determined by Pattanayek et al. (1998) although the crystallization conditions of the two samples were quite different. Since the structure of GNMT has been described in the AdoMet-GNMT paper (Fu et al., 1996), a brief description is given here. GNMT is composed of four identical subunits (A, B, C, and D). Two subunits (A and B) are related to another two subunits (C and D) by crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Figure 1(a)). The rmsd value between two subunits related by a pseudo-2-fold symmetry is Ê less than 0.5 A. The subunit is approximately spherical in shape except for the N-terminal 23 amino acid residues. Each subunit is composed of three domains, with the peptide chain organized into nine a-helices and 11 b-strands. The three domains are denoted the N-terminal domain (residues 1-40), the C-terminal domain (residues 41-175 and 243-292), and the

S-domain (residues 176-242) (Figure 2(a)). The C-terminal domain has a consensus peptide folding for the AdoMet/AdoHcy binding which is observed in all AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. The S-domain is composed of an a-helix, followed by a large loop and three antiparallel b-strands. The N-terminal domain is composed of a b-strand, a large loop (U-loop) and an a-helix aH . The b-strand and U-loop sections (residues 1-23) are far from the main body of the subunit (A). The b-strand tail section (residues 1-7) is involved in the antiparallel b-sheet hydrogen bonds with the same section of subunit D. The U-loop section (residues 9-21) enters the active site of the adjacent subunit B. Therefore each subunit looks like a closed ``molecular basket''. It is noted that although the amino acid residues in the U-loop enter deeply into the active site of the adjacent subunit, it has a low level of interaction with the adjacent subunit. Similarly helix aH , which is near the main body of the subunit, has a low level of interaction with the C-terminal domain, indicating that the N-terminal domains are mobile.

Structure of AdoHcy-R175K The overall structure of AdoHcy-R175K is similar to those of WT and R175K except for the structure of N-terminal domain. The four subunits are all independent but are related by pseudo-222 symmetry (Figure 1(b)). The rmsd values among the four subunits are slightly larger than those of

152

Ê Ê WT and R175K ($0.5 A versus $1.0 A) but there is no systematic difference among the subunits. In the subunit structure, the entire N-terminal domain (residues 1-40) has become invisible, indicating that it is heavily disordered (Figure 2(b)). The N-terminal domain apparently moves out from the active site of the adjacent subunit and into a solvent region. Consequently, the evacuation of the U-loop and the separation of helix aH open the two entrances to the active site, i.e. the evacuation of the U-loop of the adjacent subunit opens the entrance for AdoMet and the separation of helix aH opens the other entrance for glycine (Figure 3). The S-domain moves signi®cantly towards the site occupied by helix aH as if it ®lls the space generated by moving helix aH (Figure 4). AdoHcy in AdoHcy-R175K structure As shown in Figure 5, the (Fo À Fc) and (2Fo À Fc) electron density maps clearly show the presence of an AdoHcy in the active site of each subunit. An AdoHcy molecule binds to the tips (Cterminal ends) of b1 and b4, where the strand order is reversed (Figure 6). The adenine ring is located at the edge of the active site whereas the homocysteine moiety goes deep into the crevice between the C-terminal domain and S-domain. The consensus hydrogen bonds connect the 2H -OH and 3H -OH of adenosine ribose to acidic amino acid residue Asp85 located at the tip of b2 (Figure 6). The electron density of the homocysteine moiety is relatively weak, indicating that the homocysteine moiety is somewhat disordered, consistent with a low level of interaction with the protein. On the other hand, the electron density of the adenosine moiety is relatively strong. Indeed the adenine ring is stabilized by stacking with Trp117 and is connected to the protein by hydrogen bonds (N3 Á Á Á N(Ala86), N6 Á Á ÁOD(Asn116)) (Figure 7). It is noted that the adenosine moiety of AdoHcy is located at the site that was occupied by Glu15 and Gly16 residues of the U-loop, indicating that the substrate and the U-loop are in a competitive relationship (Figure 8).

Discussion
GNMT has two major conformations This study indicates that GNMT has at least two major conformations, i.e. ``closed conformation'' as seen in the AdoMet-GNMT, WT and R175K structures and ``open conformation'' as seen in the

the extended N-terminal region enters the adjacent subunit and corks the entrance of the active site of the adjacent subunit. On the other hand, in the open structure, the N domains are invisible, since they move out of the active sites and are swinging in a solvent pool.

AdoHcy-R175K structure. As shown in Figure 9, the binding site and orientation of the AdoHcy molecule in the open conformation structure are completely different from those of the AdoMet molecule in the closed conformation structure. In general, a closed conformation brings the substrates together in the active site of the enzyme. Thus a closed conformation is usually an enzymatically active form. However, as will be described

below, GNMT with an open conformation is an enzymatically active form, and the closed form is an apparently inactive form. The same crystallization conditions produced the AdoMet-GNMT and apo-GNMT crystals Each subunit has an abnormally large open space in the middle. In the free WT and R175K

structures, this space is ®lled with disordered water molecules, whereas an AdoMet molecule occupies the space in the AdoMet-GNMT structure (Fu et al., 1996). Why did the same crystallization conditions produce the AdoMet-GNMT and apoGNMT crystals? The answer might be that the electron density in the middle of the subunit of the AdoMet-GNMT crystal was simply misinterpreted as an AdoMet molecule instead of a cluster of water molecules. However, no such cluster of water molecules was found in the structures of WT and R175K. It is quite unusual to have such a large hollow space in the middle of the protein structure. Therefore, it is most likely that GNMT has two AdoMet binding sites, i.e. one is a minor site, as seen in the AdoMet-GNMT structure, and the other is a major site, as seen in the AdoHcy-R175K

structure. When GNMT is produced in recombinant Escherichia coli, an AdoMet (or AdoMet analogue) might be inserted deeply into the molecular basket with a ``wrong orientation'' by an unidenti®ed mechanism. The molecular basket is corked with the U-loop of the adjacent subunit. The hydrogen bonds between the methionine moiety of AdoMet and Glu15 of the U-loop stabilize the closed conformation during the protein puri®cation and crystallization periods. Thus, in spite of having the consensus peptide folding in the C-terminal domain, AdoMet binding in the AdoMet-GNMT crystal does not obey the consensus binding pattern (Schluckebier et al., 1995). Furthermore, as discussed below, the AdoMet binding site does not support the glycine binding site deduced from a

the AdoMet-binding domains in the other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. The S-domain, which is absent in the other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, covers the AdoMet binding site in the C-terminal domain to create a deep cleft. By sealing the one end of the cleft with a-helix aH (residues 24-36) of the N-terminal domain, the subunit becomes a molecular basket. The U-loop section (residues 9-21) of the N-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit enters into the molecular basket and corks its mouth. Consequently, the subunits of GNMT look like a ``closed molecular basket''. As a result, no apparent entrance or exit routes into or out of the active site can be identi®ed from an examination of the subunit structure (Figure 2(a)). The unique molecular basket architecture apparently stabilizes the subunit structure and either prevents substrate from entering the active site (as seen in the free WT and R175K structures) or directs the substrate into a ``wrong site'' (seen in the AdoMet-GNMT structure). It is noted that GNMT has been identi®ed, not only as the glycine methyltransferase but also as a major folate binding protein (Cook & Wagner, 1984), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-binding protein (Raha et al., 1994) and a mediator of cytochrome P4501A1 gene expression (Raha et al., 1995). The minor binding mode might play an important role in functions other than methyltransferase. The open conformation structure is consistent with the GNMT catalysis Unlike the AdoMet-binding site in the closed conformation structure, the AdoMet binding site in the open conformation structure is consistent with those of the other AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases. An AdoHcy molecule binds to the consensus AdoMet/AdoHcy binding site and forms the consensus hydrogen bonds with acidic amino acid residue Asp85. As shown in Figure 10, the AdoHcy molecule in the AdoHcy-R175K structure and the AdoMet molecule in the AdoMet-catechol

The inactivation is completely prevented by AdoMet plus acetate, a competitive inhibitor of Gly, but the presence of AdoMet alone enhances the rate of inactivation twofold. The arginine-modi®ed enzyme binds AdoMet normally (Konishi & Fujioka, 1987). This Arg175 modi®cation study indicates that the

binding of AdoMet opens the entrance of the active site and acetate binds to Arg175. Indeed, in the AdoHcy-R175K structure, the active site entrance is opened widely by binding the AdoHcy. As described below, a glycine most likely binds to Arg175. As given in Table 2, the R175K mutation substantially reduces the glycine binding af®nity (Km is increased from 0.435 mM to 364 mM), but not the AdoMet binding af®nity, indicating that Arg175 is an important amino acid residue for glycine binding. Simple modeling has been carried out in order to determine whether a methyl group of AdoMet can be transferred to a glycine coordinated to Arg175 in the AdoHcy-R175K structure. After replacing Lys175 with arginine, a glycine has Ê been inserted so as to form two 3.0 A hydrogen bonds with Arg175 (Figure 6). Its amino group can Ê then be located at 3.8 A distance from the sulfur atom of AdoHcy. In the reactive ternary complex, AdoMet would have its methyl group placed Ê along the 3.8 A line from its sulfur to the amino group of glycine, such that co-linear methyltransfer can occur. If the C-S distance in sulfonium salts is Ê similar to $1.8 A observed in the methionine structure (Torii & Iitaka, 1973), leaving a quite short disÊ tance of 2.0 A between the methyl group and amino group, perhaps it is not greatly different from the expected transition-state separations. Therefore the AdoHcy-R175K structure agrees with the results of the chemical modi®cation study (Konishi & Fujioka, 1987) and the R175K mutagenesis study. This indicates that the previously proposed catalytic mechanism based on the AdoMet-

Figure 8. AdoHcy (red bonds) in the AdoHcy-R175K open structure, and Glu15 and Gly16 (green bonds) in the SLGVAAEGIPDQY21 section (green backbone) of the N-terminal domain of subunit B in the R175K closed structure occupy the same position in the active site. The amino acid residues forming the cavity are illustrated by cyan bonds.

GNMT structure is apparently misinterpreted (Fu et al., 1996). Closed-open conformational changes Fujioka and co-workers have characterized several important properties of GNMT. (1) GNMT binds its substrates in an obligatory order, with AdoMet as the ®rst substrate (Konishi & Fujioka, 1987). (2) GNMT shows sigmoidal rate behavior with respect to AdoMet, but it shows no cooperativity toward glycine (Ogawa & Fujioka, 1982b; Ogawa et al., 1993). (3) The sigmoidal behavior is due to the equilibrium cooperative binding of AdoMet to the catalytic site residing on each subunit (i.e. a rapid and reversible binding of AdoMet occurs before the rate-limiting step), and the rate of breakdown of each enzyme-substrate complex is not affected by the presence or absence of ligands in other protomers (Konishi & Fujioka, 1988). (4) In the presence of AdoMet, cleavage of the eight residues of the N-terminal with trypsin occurred much more rapidly than in its absence (Konishi & Fujioka, 1988). (5) The truncated enzyme, while having a threefold lower K0.5 value for AdoMet and comparable Vmax value to those of the native enzyme, showed no cooperativity toward AdoMet (Konishi & Fujioka, 1988). These properties are quite consistent with the great mobility of the N-terminal domains in the GNMT structure. On the basis of the Fujioka's observations and the closed and open confor-

mation structures found in this study, the kinetic events of GNMT could be visualized as follows. (1) At ®rst, as seen in the closed structure, the tail section of N-terminal region (residues 1-7) of subunit A, which involves in the antiparallel b-sheet hydrogen bonds with the same section of subunit D, breaks the hydrogen bonds and moves into a solvent region. (2) The dynamic motion of the tail section facilitates the movement of the U-loop section (residues 9-21). After moving the U-loop section out from the entrance of the active site of subunit B, an AdoMet enters the active site of subunit B and binds to the site occupied by Glu15 and Gly16. It is noted that AdoMet and the U-loop are competing for the AdoMet-binding site. (3) The binding of AdoMet to the active site of subunit B enhances the movement of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-40) of subunit B. The end section (residues 1-21) of the N-terminal domain of subunit B readily moves out from the active site of subunit A and into a solvent region. The second AdoMet binds to the active site of subunit A. (4) Finally the sections of helices aH (residues 2140) of subunits A and B separate from the mainbodies and go into a solvent region. A glycine enters the active site through the channel opened by separation of helix aH . These series of the N domain movements would create cooperativity for AdoMet as well as an AdoMet-®rst ordered-sequential-reaction. The product (sarcosine molecule) leaves through the channel before helix aH returns back to its original site. In the ®nal step, AdoHcy is released and the U-loop section of the N-terminal domain again occupies the AdoMet binding site. A similar series of events

The AdoMet-COMT structure was superimposed on the AdoHcy-R175K structure by Ê spatially aligning the alpha carbon atoms of b-strands 1-7 (rmsd  1.95 A), and the COMT structure was then removed, leaving its AdoMet.

transferases, GNMT is less active at low AdoMet concentrations and is less inhibited by AdoHcy. As the U-loop section of the N-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit occupies the AdoMet binding site, the section competes strongly with AdoMet at low AdoMet concentrations (Figure 8). Whereas the U-loop forces the departure of the AdoHcy from the active site and facilitates the methyltransfer reaction even at high AdoHcy concentrations by relieving AdoHcy inhibition. On the other hand, most methyltransferases are monomeric proteins and have no S and N-terminal-like domains in their structures. Therefore, the active sites of the other methyltransferases are located on the protein surface and thus exposed to a solvent pool, as commonly seen in most enzymes. An AdoMet molecule can easily access the active site even at low AdoMet concentrations. Thus, enzyme activities are relatively high even at low AdoMet concentrations. When the AdoHcy concentration is increased, AdoMet binding sites of the methyltransferases are occupied by AdoHcy molecules, resulting in strong inhibition. A few tetrameric methyltransferases other than GNMT have been reported, though their crystal structures have not yet been determined. Those are: L-methionine S-methyltransferase (James et al., 1995), O-demethyl puromycin O-methyltransferase (Lacalle et al., 1991) and C-terminal isoprenylcysteine protein carboxyl methyltransferase (Boivin et al., 1994). Among these, methionine methyltransferase from Wollastonia bi¯ora leaves is reported to show hyperbolic kinetics toward both substrates, AdoMet and methionine (James et al., 1995). It is of interest to know whether its structure is similar to the GNMT structure.

Loop and enzyme catalysis To our knowledge, GNMT is the ®rst example of an auto-inhibitory and a forced product release mechanism. In contrast to our results, many enzymes have a ¯exible loop over the active site, which facilitates the catalytic activity by helping substrate binding. For example, the ¯exible loop of triosephosphate isomerase behaves in the opposite manner to that of the N-terminal domain of GNMT. Three conformations of the ¯exible loop near the active site of the isomerase have been found: open (no ligand), almost closed (sulfate), and fully closed (phosphate and phosphonate complexes) (Noble et al., 1993). Lolis & Petsko (1990) reported independently that a ten-residue ¯exible Ê loop moved over 7 A to close the active site when the structure of the complexed enzyme was compared to that of the unliganded form of the enzyme. A site-directed mutagenesis study concluded that the most important property of the ¯exible loop of the enzyme lies in stabilizing the active site when ligands bind and the loop closes (Sampson & Knowles, 1992). In dihydrofolate reductase, a ¯exible loop (residues 16-20) involved in binding the nicotinamide was found to be disordered in the holo-enzyme (Bystroff et al., 1990). A kinetic study showed that there was a remarkable correlation between ¯uorescence lifetime of bound NADPH and rates of hydride transfer among mutants of the enzyme (Farnum et al., 1991). In addition to these two enzymes, ¯exible loops over the active sites of several enzymes have been indicated by the X-ray crystal structure analyses, e.g. ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Curmi et al., 1992), tryptophan synthase (Hyde et al., 1988), aspartate aminotransferase (Ford et al., 1980) and lactate dehydrogenase (Abad-Zapatero et al., 1987).

Physiological significance of auto-inhibitory and forced product release mechanisms The Ki values of GNMTs for AdoHcy are in the range of 35 to 80 mM and are much higher than the values of other methyltransferases (e.g. 0.4 mM for tRNA methyltransferases) (Kerr & Heady, 1974). Thus, at physiological concentrations of AdoMet (0.1-0.2 mmol/g of liver, or 150-280 mM) and AdoHcy (0.02-0.06 mmol/g liver, or 28-85 mM) (Balaghi et al., 1993), GNMT would exhibit appreciable activity, whereas other methyltransferases appear to be considerably inhibited. The properties of GNMT are particularly suited for regulation of the cellular AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio. First, the weak AdoHcy inhibition allows the enzyme to reduce the AdoMet/AdoHcy ratio by conversion of AdoMet to AdoHcy at any concentration range of AdoHcy while other methyltransferases become inactive at high levels of AdoHcy. Secondly, the low activity at low AdoMet levels protects again complete consumption of AdoMet supplies, while the non-sigmoidal characteristic of other methyltransferases would not allow this protection.

Experimental Procedures
Site-directed mutagenesis Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to prepare cDNA encoding the R175K mutant GNMT. The oligonucleotide primer, GTCGTAGTTCTTGTGGTCGATGAC, was synthesized on a Cyclone Plus DNA synthesizer (MilliGen/Biosearch) and puri®ed by HPLC on a Cosmosil 5C18 300 (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) column. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out based on the method described by Kunkel et al. (1987) using a Mutan-K site-directed mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). A clone containing the desired mutation was identi®ed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Enzyme assay The GNMT activity was determined spectrophotometrically. The assay mixture contained in 2 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.2), 0.1 mM AdoMet, 10 mM glycine, 60 mg of recombinant adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and 1.4 units of calf intestine adenosine deaminase (Sigma, MO, USA). The reaction was started by adding GNMT, and the decrease in absorbance at

Auto-inhibition and Forced Product Release Mechanisms in GNMT plate X-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode X-ray generator as an X-ray source (CuKa radiation operated at 50 kV and 100 mA). The deduced unit cell dimensions Ê Ê (a  b  77.9 A, c  227.1 A) indicated that the crystal complexed with AdoHcy was no longer isomorphous to either the WT or R175K crystals. The diffraction data Ê were measured up to 3.0 A resolution at À180  C. The data were processed with the program DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The data statistics are given in Table 1.

265 nm due to the conversion of adenosine to inosine was followed at 30  C. The difference in molar absorption coef®cient between adenosine and inosine at this wavelength was taken as 7.6 Â 10À3M cmÀ1. In some cases, the product inosine was measured by HPLC as described (Takata et al., 1994). The Km and Vmax values were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using the least-squares regression method. The Ki values for the acetate inhibition were calculated from the slopes of Lineweaver-Burk plots and the concentrations of acetate. The kcat values were obtained from the slope of the timedependent absorption-spectra. Purification and crystallization procedures E. coli JM109 harboring the pCWGNMT plasmids encoding the WT or R175K mutant protein were grown at 37  C in 1 liter of 2 Â YT medium containing 35 mg of ampicillin. When the cell turbidity at 600 nm reached an absorbance of 0.2, IPTG was added to make a ®nal concentration of 1 mM, and the culture was continued for an additional 14 hours. The WT and mutant enzymes were puri®ed to homogeneity from E. coli extracts by gel ®ltration over Sephacryl S-300 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Ogawa et al., 1997). The hanging drop method of vapor diffusion was employed for crystallization of the enzyme. Crystals of the WT and R175K enzymes were grown under the following conditions: 100 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6), 100 mM ammonium acetate, 50 mM NaCl, 13 % (w/v) PEG4000 with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. Thick plate-shaped crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies ($0.5 mm Â 0.5 mm Â 0.2 mm) were grown for two weeks. Crystals of the AdoHcy-R175K complex were grown in a solution containing 5 mM AdoHcy, 100 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 5.6), 50 mM NaCl, 10 % PEG3400 with a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml. Although we tried to grow crystals with an excess of AdoMet, no crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction studies were obtained. Data measurement The R175K crystals were mounted in the glass capillaries with the mother liquor, and placed on a locally modi®ed DIP100S imaging plate X-ray diffractometer (manufactured by MAC Science, Japan) with a rotating anode X-ray generator as X-ray source (CuKa radiation operated at 50 kV and 100 mA). The unit cell dimensions Ê Ê Ê (a  86.4 A, b  175.7 A, c  45.5 A) deduced from the diffraction data indicated that the crystal of R175K was isomorphous to the AdoMet-GNMT crystal previously prepared (Fu et al., 1996). The diffraction data were Ê measured up to 2.5 A resolution using two crystals at room temperature ($22  C). The data were processed with the program ELMS (Tanaka et al., 1990). Integrated re¯ections were scaled and reduced with locally developed programs (Takusagawa, 1992). Ê The 2.5 A resolution data of GNMT were obtained with a Rigaku RAXIS imaging plate X-ray diffractometer at room temperature ($22  C). The data were processed with the program DENZO (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). An AdoHcy-R175K crystal in a hanging drop was scooped by a nylon loop and dipped into a cryo-protectant solution containing 20 % (v/v) ethylene glycol, 50 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.6) and 10 % PEG3400 for 30 seconds before the crystal was frozen in cold nitrogen gas (À180  C) on a Rigaku RAXIS imaging

Structure determination Since the crystals of WT and R175K were isomorphous to that of AdoMet-GNMT (Fu et al., 1996), their structures were directly re®ned with the coordinates of AdoMet-GNMT by the POSITIONAL routine of X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1993). In the R175K structure, Arg175 was replaced with Lys and its side-chain was ®tted into an (2Fo À Fc) electron density map. The structures were further re®ned with the simulated annealing procedure È of X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993). For the R175K-AdoHcy complex, the unit cell dimensions and space group (P41 or P43) indicated that an asymmetric unit contains one tetrameric enzyme. The crystal structure was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using a two-subunit dimer in the R175K structure as a search model. The translational searches with space group P41 and P43 clearly indicated the correct space group to be P43. The crystal structure was re®ned by the standard re®nement procedure in the XPLOR protocol. A (2Fo À Fc) map computed after a re®nement showed no signi®cant electron density for the amino acid residues 1 to 40, indicating that these residues were heavily disordered. Therefore, the amino acid residues 1 to 40 of the four subunits were removed from the model. The model was re®ned with the POSITIONAL protocol and then the simulated annealing È procedure of X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993). During the later stages of re®nement, difference maps (Fo À Fc maps) showed a large signi®cant residual electron density peak in the region of the active site. Since the mutant enzyme was crystallized in the presence of an excess of AdoHcy (5 mM), an AdoHcy molecule was ®tted into the electron density peak (Figure 5). Other well-de®ned residual electron density peaks in difference maps were assigned to water molecules if peaks were able to bind the protein molecules with hydrogen bonds (Tanaka et al., 1990; Wagner et al., 1989).
