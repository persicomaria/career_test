The coleopteran-active -endotoxin Cry3Bb1 from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strain EG7231 is uniquely toxic to Diabrotica undecimpunctata, the Southern corn rootworm, while retaining activity against Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the Colorado potato beetle. The crystal structure of the -endoÊ toxin Cry3Bb1 has been re®ned using data collected to 2.4 A resolution, with a residual R factor of 17.5% and an Rfree of 25.3%. The structure is made up of three domains: I, a sevenhelix bundle (residues 64±294); II, a three-sheet domain (residues 295±502); and III, a -sandwich domain (residues 503±652). The monomers in the orthorhombic C2221 crystal lattice form a dimeric quaternary structure across a crystallographic twofold axis, with a channel formed involving interactions between domains I and III. There are 23 hydrogen bonds between the two monomers conferring structural stability on the dimer. It has been demonstrated that Cry3Bb1 and the similar toxin Cry3A form oligomers in solution. The structural results presented here indicate that the interactions between domains I and III could be responsible for the initial higher order structure and have implications for the biological activity of these toxins. There are seven additional single amino-acid residues in the sequence of Cry3Bb1 compared with that of Cry3A; one in domain I, two in domain II and four in domain III, which also shows the largest conformational difference between the two proteins. These changes can be implicated in the selectivity differences noted for these two -endotoxins.

1. Introduction
B. thuringiensis (Bt) is a Gram-positive soil bacterium characterized in part by its ability to produce crystalline inclusions during sporulation. These inclusions consist of proteins exhibiting highly speci®c insecticidal activity which are referred to as -endotoxins or insecticidal crystal proteins. Most commercially important Bt strains express a variety of different -endotoxins selected for speci®c pest-control capabilities. The currently known B. thuringiensis -endotoxins have been grouped into 22 classes based on sequence homology (Crickmore et al., 1998; Schnepf, 1995). The updated nomenclature and dendrogram of Bt -endotoxins can be found at http://www.biols.susx.ac.uk/home/ Neil_Crickmore/Bt. The Cry3 class is best known for insecticidal activity against larval Coleoptera. Both Cry3A and Cry3Bb1 are EPA registered for use in biopesticides. Cry3A is also registered for use in transgenic plants. The molecular weights of -endotoxins range from 135± 140 kDa (Cry1 protoxins) to 55±72 kDa for activated Cry1,

Cry2 and Cry3 toxins. These toxins must be solubilized in the insect digestive tract and in some cases activated to smaller molecular-weight forms, e.g. Cry1 protoxin (135 kDa) to Cry1 (55 kDa) activated toxin (Bulla et al., 1977). During activation, peptides are removed from both the N- and C-terminus of the protoxin. In solution, some toxins form quaternary structures (Walters et al., 1994), a process that may be required for formation of even higher order polymeric structures in arti®cial bilayers to explain the extremely high conductances generated by these toxins (Slatin et al., 1990). Analysis of data from polyacrylamide-gel and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments suggests that the size of the Cry3A oligomer in solution is a dimer. Structural data for Cry3A reveal that the toxin is made up of three domains (Li et al., 1991) and that toxin monomers form a dimeric structure in the crystal lattice. Based on the equivalent migration on polyacrylamide gels of Cry3Bb1 and Cry3A, which have 85% sequence homology, it is assumed that the quaternary structure of Cry3Bb1 is also a dimer (Walters et al., 1994; English, unpublished analytical ultracentrifugation data). After solubilization, the toxins must bind to receptors on brush-border epithelia in the insect midgut, a combination stomach and small intestine. The receptor for Cry3 proteins has not been identi®ed, although Cry3 proteins bind to brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from Leptinatarsa decemlineata (Slaney et al., 1992; Bel®ore et al., 1994). A Bt toxin±receptor protein complex for Cry1Ac contained aminopeptidase N and alkaline phosphatase and has been successfully reconstituted (Sangadala et al., 1994). This complex reduces the effective concentration of the toxin by at least 1000-fold, consistent with previous experiments with reconstituted brush border that also reduced the effective toxin concentration by 1000-fold (English et al., 1991). In independent experiments (Knight et al., 1994), aminopeptidase N was observed to be the primary binding protein for Cry1Ac and Cry1Aa in Manduca sexta. Another binding protein reported is a 210 kDa membrane glycoprotein that speci®cally binds the Cry1Ab toxin of Bt subspecies berliner (Vadlamudi et al., 1995). This protein is different from the Cry1Ac receptor±protein complex containing aminopeptidase N reconstituted by Sangadala et al. (1994). More recently, other aminopeptidase N enzymes have been characterized and shown to be the putative receptors for activated Cry1 toxins (Luo et al., 1996; Denolf et al., 1997; Hua et al., 1998; Cooper et al., 1998). Data for Cry1Ac revealed a biphasic binding mechanism to aminopeptidase N, as N-acetylgalactosamine inhibited the initial association but not the high-af®nity state (Carroll et al., 1997), and further analysis suggests that there is a two-step mechanism by which Cry1Ac binds and permeabilizes the midgut membrane (Cooper et al., 1998). Mutational analysis of domain III residues in Cry1Ac also indicated that the mutated residues play an important role in binding by recognition of the sugar on the putative receptor glucosaminopeptidase N (Burton et al., 1999). Binding of -endotoxins to speci®c receptors effectively concentrates the toxin on the brush border, a process that probably also enhances the ability of the toxin molecules to associate together and spontaneously penetrate the bilayer. After assuming a membrane-bound position, the toxin forms ion channels that probably depend on the quaternary structure of the toxin and higher order structures that may form in the membrane (Slatin et al., 1990). Eventually, large less Ê speci®c pores 10±20 A in diameter are formed by Bt toxins and colloid osmotic lysis kills the cell as demonstrated in insect-cell culture (Knowles & Ellar, 1987; Knowles et al., 1991). The ion channels formed by -endotoxins are highly diverse. Cry1Ac and Cry3A form cation-selective and voltageindependent channels (Slatin et al., 1990), while Cry2A and Cry3Bb1 form less selective but voltage-dependent channels (English et al., 1994; Von Tersch et al., 1994). It has also been reported that Cry1C forms pH-dependent anion-selective channels (Schwartz et al., 1993, 1997). Cry3Bb1 is a rootworm-active -endotoxin (Rupar et al., 1991; Donovan et al., 1992). The speci®c toxicity of Cry3Bb1 on the southern corn rootworm (Diabrotica undecimpunctata) suggests that differences in one or more of the steps in the mode of action create a uniquely toxic environment for Cry3Bb1 in the southern corn rootworm that is not achieved by Cry3A. Differences in solubility, oligomerization, binding and channel formation have been observed between Cry3Bb1 and other Cry3 toxins and these properties might all contribute to the unique insecticidal activity of this toxin (English, unpublished work). To date, structural data are available only for coleopteranspeci®c Cry3A (Li et al., 1991), the lepidopteran-speci®c Cry1Aa (Grochulski et al., 1995) and the dipteran-speci®c protoxin CytB (Li et al., 1996) from B. thuringiensis. Both Cry3A and Cry1Aa structures have three distinct domains and similar folds; however, there are signi®cant differences in domain II of these toxins. The protoxin CytB has a single domain in an / dimer (Li et al., 1996). We report the crystal Ê structure determination at 2.4 A resolution of Cry3Bb1, the structure of the coleopteran-active -endotoxin from B. thuringiensis (Bt) strain EG7231, and compare its structure with the homologous Cry3A and Cry1Aa endotoxins.

2. Materials and methods
As previously reported (Cody et al., 1992; Galitsky et al., 1994), crystals of Cry3Bb1 belong to the space group C2221, with Ê unit-cell parameters a = 122.44, b = 131.81, c = 105.37 A, and contain one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Native data to Ê 2.4 A resolution and derivative data sets for Hg and Pt derivatives were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku R-AXIS IIc imaging-plate system (Table 1). Native crystals were soaked with heavy atoms for a period of 24±48 h. The structure of Cry3Bb1 was solved using multiple isomorphous replacement methods and the structure re®ned prior to the availability of the coordinates for Cry3A. Comparison of these two structures shows an overall r.m.s. for all backbone atoms Ê Ê Ê of 1.6 A with an average deviation of 0.8 A for domain I, 0.7 A Ê for domain III, con®rming the for domain II and 1.3 A structure solution.

Heavy-atom sites in each derivative were located from difference Patterson functions using the program HASSP (Terwilliger & Eisenberg, 1983) and heavy-atom parameters were re®ned using the program HEAVY (Terwilliger & Eisenberg, 1983). Solvent-¯attened data were prepared using the program of Wang (1985). The choice of enantiomorph was determined from the handedness of the -helices. A single site for the Hg derivative and one major and ®ve minor sites for the Pt data (Table 1) were used to phase the native data and produced interpretable electron-density maps. A continuous polypeptide chain from residues 64±652 was traced. The initial atomic model was built using the program FRODO (Jones, 1978) operating on a PS390 Evans and Southerland graphics system running on a VAX 8600 computer. Later re®nement È and model building were carried out using X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) and CHAIN (Sack, 1988) running on a Silicon Graphics R10000. Re®nement of the model by simulated annealing in È X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) reduced the R factor from 31.6 to 26.1% without individual B factors for 15 811 data in the Ê resolution range 8±3 A and to 22.1% for 26 236 data in the Ê resolution range 8±2.5 A with restrained individual B factors. Prior to re®nement, 10% of the data, chosen at random with the protocol in X-PLOR, were selected to calculate Rfree. The model was adjusted between re®nement cycles on the graphics and 251 water molecules were added in the ®nal cycles of re®nement. The ®nal re®nement parameters are shown in Table 2. A Ramachandran plot (Laskowski et al., 1993) revealed that more than 92% of the residues were in their most favored conformations.

3. Results
3.1. Tertiary structure

The structure of Cry3Bb1 is similar to Cry3A (Li et al., 1991) and Cry1Aa (Grochulski et al., 1995) and also has three discrete domains. In Cry3Bb1, domain I (residues 64±294) has a seven-helix bundle which forms a left-handed superhelix around a central helix, domain II (residues 295±503) has three antiparallel -sheets and domain III (residues 504±652) has a sandwich structure with two antiparallel -sheets (Fig. 1). Similar to Cry3A (Li et al., 1991), the ®rst 60 N-terminal residues of Cry3Bb1 were also not observed in this crystal structure. There are seven additional single amino acids (i.e. Ala104, Lys416, Gln453, Lys554, Leu557, Lys624 and Glu626) in the sequence of Cry3Bb1 compared with that of Cry3A. The majority of these insertions are located in domain III. As expected because of the high degree of sequence homology, the two structures have similar conformations, with the largest differences observed in domain III. The seven-helical bundle of domain I is long and twisted around the central helix 5 surrounded by six outer helices, which creates greater structural stability for the bundle (Fig. 1). The outer helices are oriented counterclockwise when viewed from the C- to the N-terminus around the central helix, with helices 1 and 7 adjacent to the -sheet domains (Fig. 2). The residues which make up the helical bundle encompass residues 64±80 Figure 1 for helix 1, 91±99 for helix 2a, 106±118 (a) Schematic ribbon representation of Cry3Bb1 showing its three-domain organization: domain I (magenta), domain II (cyan) and domain III (green).

helical segment between residues 100±105 and includes an additional residue, Ala104, compared with the sequence of Cry3A (Li et al., 1991) (Figs. 3 and 4). There is greater surface exposure of residues Ser102 and Asp103 in Cry3Bb1 as a result of this insertion. The major changes in domain I of these two toxins involve the conformation of loop regions encompassing residues 81±90, 100±105, 155±159 and 216±222. Also, three more N-terminal residues were observed in the tertiary structure of Cry3A than in Cry3Bb1. Of the two 2 helical segments, only helix 2b is packed against helix 5. The other helices are long and, similar to the structure reported for Cry3A (Li et al., 1991), have eight, seven, six, nine and seven helical turns in helices 3±7,

respectively. There are two -turns in the loop between helix 4 and 5. The loop between helix 6 and 7 is close to the loop region for residues 310±318 of domain II, which has Ê contacts of 2.9 A between the side chains of residues Asp261 and Gln316. In domain I, helices 6 and 7 are packed further away from the other helices in the bundle. The loops at the bottom of these helices also lie near loop 310±318 of domain II and form a series of close interactions involving Ê Ser258 OÁ Á ÁPhe322 N (2.8 A), Asp261 OD1Á Á ÁGln31 NE26 Ê Ê (2.9 A), Asn267 ND2Á Á ÁPhe305 O (3.0 A), and a salt Ê bridge between Arg270 NH1Á Á ÁGlu326 OE1 (2.9 A) and Ê Arg270 NH2Á Á ÁGlu326 OE2 (3.3 A). There is also an Ê interaction with water (Arg270 NH2Á Á ÁWat68 O, 2.7 A). In addition, Glu326 interacts with Trp263 Ê (Trp263 NE1Á Á ÁGlu326 OE1, 3.0 A). Domain II (Fig. 5; residues 295±501) contains three antiparallel -sheets. Sheet 1, composed of strands 5, 2, 3 and 4, and sheet 2, composed of strands 8, 7, 6 and 9, form the distinctive `Greek key' motif, similar to that observed in Cry3A (Li et al., 1991). The outer surface of sheet 3 (1, 11 and 10) makes contact with helix 7 of domain I. There is also a pocket formed by part of helix 6 and 7 and the loop of strands 1 and 2 of domain II. The strand which begins at residue 295 follows the face of domain I to the loop at residues 310±318, which along with the loop at residues 350±355, acts as a hook projecting out of the surface of domain II and interacts with the loop between helices 6 and 7. Interactions between domains I and II are strengthened by a hydrogen bond between Gln316 of domain II and Asp261 of domain I. This interaction is not observed in the structure of Cry3A owing to changes in the local conformation as a consequence of the differences in the sequence of these two proteins. Comparison of the loop conformation of residues 310±318 of Cry3Bb1 and the corresponding regions of Cry3A (Li et al., 1991) and Cry1Aa (Grochulski et al., 1995) show differences that suggest this region is ¯exible (Fig. 5). The contacts between domains I, II and III form a cavity ®lled with waters which hydrogen bond among themselves and the adjacent protein side chains. There are two additional residues in domain II of Cry3Bb1 not present in the sequence of Cry3A: Lys416 and Gln453. A

possible effect of the insertion of Lys416 in domain II is to stabilize the structure by formation of a hydrogen bond to Ê Asp486 (2.9 A) and thereby stabilize the conformation of the two loops between residues 310±318 and residues 485±488. Additionally, the side chain of Arg487 is extended and is oriented in the same direction as Lys416, thereby forming a hydrophilic pocket surrounded by residues Lys416, Tyr418, Asp486 and Arg487 (Fig. 6). This stability is not present in Cry3A as there are no equivalent side chains capable of hydrogen-bond formation (Cry3A has a glycine in position 486). Thus, without this additional residue found in Cry3Bb1, the side chains of Cry3A are not close enough to form hydrogen-bond contacts. The insertion of Gln453 in Cry3Bb1 (Fig. 7) terminates the loop region between residues 443 and 453 which deviates in conformation from the loop observed in the structure of Cry3A (Li et al., 1991). As a result, Gln453 participates in hydrogen bonds with the backbone of Asp307 and a water molecule, which in turn hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of Thr403. In the structure of Cry3A, Trp450 occupies the same space as Gln453 and forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone of residue Thr306, but cannot form the hydrogen bond through water, as Ala401 has no hydrogen-bond acceptor. The most signi®cant differences between the tertiary structure of Cry3Bb1 and that reported for Cry3A are in domain III (residues 503±652) (Fig. 8), which has a `jelly-roll' -barrel topology with a hydrophobic core, whereas domain III of Cry1Aa has the greatest similarity to domain III of Cry3A (Grochulski et al., 1995). There are four single-residue insertions in domain III of Cry3Bb1 (i.e. Lys554, Leu557, Lys624 and Glu626) not present in the sequence of Cry3A (Li et al., 1991). As shown (Fig. 8), these residues all lie on one surface of domain III between strands 16±17 and 22±23. The two singleresidue insertions at positions 554 and 557 form an -turn and the two-residue insertion at positions 624 and 626 of loop 622±625 causes it to extend, ®nger-like, from the surface of domain III. The side chain of the inserted residue Glu626 forms Ê a hydrogen bond to Tyr521 (2.8 A) and provides more structure for the turn Figure 3 around loop residues 620±625 by Stereo electron-density pro®le (2Fo À Fc, 1') for region in domain I of Cry3Bb1 showing the formation of hydrogen bonds insertion of Ala104.

Crystal packing along the twofold axis parallel to the a axis results in a dimer of Cry3Bb1 (Fig. 9), which also reveals the interaction between helices 3 and 4 of two molecules related along the twofold axis. This is also a feature of the packing in the structure of Cry3A (Li et al., 1991), but is not the case in the structure of Cry1Aa (Grochulski et al., 1995). Helix 6 lies in a cleft formed by the interface of domain I, its symmetryrelated molecule and domain III.

monomer and one intramolecular hydrogen bond involving His231 NE2Á Á ÁTyr230 OH. Solvent is also present in this cleft, which participates in two additional hydrogen bonds between the two monomers. Along this surface there is another cleft formed near residue His231 which is near the top of helix 6 of domain I. There are three water molecules in the cleft, which form a network of hydrogen bonds involving the side chains of His231 NE2Á Á Á Ê Tyr230 OH (2.9 A) from two symmetry-related molecules and, within the same molecule, His231 NE2Á Á ÁAsp288 OD1 Ê Ê (2.9 A), Wat13 OÁ Á ÁTyr606 OH (2.9 A), Wat48 OÁ Á ÁAsp288 Ê ) and Wat48 OÁ Á ÁWat13 O (2.7 A). Similar Ê OD1 (2.6 A interactions are also observed along the dimer interface in the structure Cry3A; however, a sequence change from His231 to Lys230 in Cry3A results in fewer hydrogen-bond interactions.

4. Discussion
4.1. Functional role of domains

Since the publication of the Cry3A structure, researchers have been able to assign some functions to particular toxin structures. It has been demonstrated that only the -helical bundle of Cry3Bb1 (Von Tersch et al., 1994) and domain I of Cry1Ac, also presumed to be an -helical bundle, are capable of forming ion channels (Walters et al., 1994; Chen et al., 1993) con®rming the suggestion from the crystal structure that this is a membrane-active region (Li et al., 1991). Helix 5 has been speci®cally implicated in the channel-formation process (Gazit & Shai, 1993, 1995; Gazit et al., 1994, 1998), as a slightly modi®ed synthetic helix 5 is highly membrane active. These data suggest that only domain I or a portion of domain I need penetrate the membrane to account for the ion-channel activity of -endotoxins, although the mechanism whereby these channel-forming toxins and toxin fragments are able to assume a membrane-bound form and produce the structure capable of forming channels has not yet been determined. One of the processes that might lead to the formation of the membrane-bound toxin is the ability of the toxin to form oligomeric structures. Cry3A and Cry3Bb1 both oligomerize in solution (Walters et al., 1994), but this process may continue even further in the membrane. Additional evidence for a dimer structure in solution for Cry3Bb1 is apparent from the crystal structure, which reveals extensive hydrogen bonding across the domain I±domain III interface. Thus, the function of domain III could include the propensity to form an oligomer in solution and thereby increase the stability of the protein. While it is tempting to Figure 5 Comparison of domain II for Cry3Bb1 (yellow) and Cry3A (green), illustrating the three propose that the ion channel is formed at the antiparallel -sheets. The sites of amino-acid insertion, residues Lys416 and Gln453, are dimer interface, the question about the also highlighted. membrane-bound structure really must be resolved before an accurate proposal for the ion-channel structure is made. Nonetheless, the assignment of a discrete solution quaternary structure for a -endotoxin provides a starting point for determining events that may subsequently occur at the membrane. Analysis of the ion channels formed by full-length Cry3Bb1 and domain I alone suggest that the channel characteristics of domain I might be modulated by other domains (Von Tersch et al., 1994). Differences between domain I from Cry1Ac and the activated toxin were Figure 6 also reported (Walters et al., 1993).

toxins dramatically alter the binding properties of these toxins (Wu & Aronson, 1992). These data suggest that both domain I and domain II participate in the binding function. Chen et al. (1995), for example, also demonstrated that alterations in domain I of Cry1Ab altered the binding properties of this toxin. In addition, the formation of a stable dimer (involving domain III) may also be important to effective receptor±toxin interactions. Mutagenic studies of the surface loops in domain II of Cry3A suggest that loop III (residues 481±486) may play a role in membrane insertion (Wu & Dean, 1996). Structural data for Cry1Aa and Cry3A reveal that these loops are highly mobile, as re¯ected by their higher thermal motion and support these mutational data. Similar mutational studies in these loop regions of domain II of Cry1C reveal that changes in these regions can selectively affect toxicity for different species (Abdul-Raul & Ellar, 1999). Li et al. (1991) suggested that one function of domain III was to provide proteolytic stability to the toxin. While this may be true, to date no con®rmation of this hypothesis has been obtained. From the analysis of the quaternary structure of Cry3Bb1, an additional argument can also be made for the involvement of domain III in the formation of a stable dimer in solution. Thus, the function of domain III should include the propensity to form a solution oligomer. Assignment of segregated functions to each of the three domains has provided signi®cant experimental ideas, but the data suggest that functions and domains are probably not strictly segregated (English et al., 1995). Bt toxins have in part a common poreforming function with other bacterial toxins, e.g. colicins, diphtheria toxin and staphlococcus  toxin (Ghosh et al., 1994; Qiu et al., 1995), but the structural information presented here does not permit extrapolation to a common mechanism of pore formation. It Figure 7 is reasonable to suggest, however, that like Comparison of Cry3Bb1 (yellow) and Cry3A (green) showing conformational differences other bacterial toxins some structural rearin¯uenced by the insertion of Gln453. rangements occur upon membrane association (Parker et al., 1989; Slatin et al., 1994). In the case of colicin Ia (Parker et al., 1989) and diphtheria toxin (Slatin et al., 1994; Silverman et al., 1994), only a part of the -helical bundle needs to penetrate the membrane for full ion-channel activity. Gazit & Shai (1995) have demonstrated that helix 5 is a channel-forming helix and that helix 7 may also participate in the membrane activity of Cry3A. Caution, however must be taken in Figure 8 extrapolating from this research, as Comparison of domain III for Cry3Bb1 (yellow) and Cry3A (green), illustrating the `jelly-roll' -barrel helix 5 is one tenth as active a pore topology. Positions 554, 557, 624 and 626 are additional residues in Cry3Bb1 not present in Cry3A. Note former as the full-length toxin. that the additional residues all lie on one surface of domain III. between the two Cry3 structures may be important in forming dimers and the probability of forming higher order structures in the membrane. Chen et al. (1993) demonstrated that the arginine-rich -strand (22) can dramatically alter the behavior of the ion channels produced by Cry1Aa. It is notable that -22 in Cry3Bb1 rests alongside domain I and is theoretically in a position to modulate the behavior of the toxin-formed ion channels. Schwartz (2000) suggests that a tetrameric form of Cry1Ac exists in the membrane. The forces that hold this oligomer together in the membrane are not known and may not be the same as the interactions observed between domain III and domain I in the Cry3Bb1 homodimer. The prominent loop regions of domain II in Cry3A have been implicated in the binding of the toxin to the brush-border epithelium of the insect midgut membrane. These same loop regions are a prominent feature of Cry3Bb1 and by analogy may play a critical role in binding and insecticidal speci®city. Care must be taken, however, in the assignment of the binding function to domain II only. Mutations in domain I from Cry1A

5. Summary
We report the crystal structure of Cry3Bb1 from the Bt strain Ê EG7231 re®ned to 2.4 A resolution. These data reveal that the structure of Cry3Bb1 is made up of three domains, similar to that observed for the structure of Cry3A, with which Cry3Bb1 shares 85% sequence homology. There are seven singleresidue insertions in the sequence of Cry3Bb1 compared with that of Cry3A. Domain I has a seven-helical bundle with a central -helix, domain II is composed of three antiparallel -sheets and domain III has a sandwich structure with two antiparallel -sheets. The monomers in the crystal form a dimeric quaternary structure across a crystallographic twofold axis, with a solvent pocket formed involving interactions between domains I and III. It has been demonstrated recently that only the -helical bundle of domain I of Cry3Bb1 is suf®cient to form ion channels. These data suggest that domain I penetrates the membrane to account for the ion-channel activity. One process that might lead to the formation of membrane-bound toxins is the ability to form higher order structures. Thus, the observation of dimer formation in the crystal structure of Cry3Bb1 supports this hypothesis. Also, differences in domain III between the structure of Cry3Bb1 and Cry3A may be important in the regulation of channel function at the dimer interface, as well as imparting speci®city of action. The authors thank C. Kulesza and A. Bastian for their help in the preparation and puri®cation of the Cry3Bb1 samples, M. Von Tersch for preparing B. thuringiensis and B. megaterium cultures expressing Cry3Bb1, and W. Donovan for the use of EG7231 for the production of Cry3Bb1. We also thank Drs Charles M. Weeks and Zdzislaw Wawrzak for their help with the heavyatom phasing and protocols for X-PLOR re®nement.
