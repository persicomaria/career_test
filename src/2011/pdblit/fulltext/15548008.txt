Abstract: We present the structure-based optimization of a series of estrogen receptor- (ER ) selective ligands. X-ray cocrystal structures of these ligands complexed to both ERR and ER are described. We also discuss how molecular modeling was used to take advantage of subtle differences between the two binding cavities in order to optimize selectivity for ER over ERR. Quantum chemical calculations are utilized to gain insight into the mechanism of selectivity enhancement. Despite only two relatively conservative residue substitutions in the ligand binding pocket, the most selective compounds have greater than 100fold selectivity for ER relative to ERR when measured using a competitive radioligand binding assay.

Introduction

Estrogen receptors (ERs) are ligand activated transcription factors. The primary endogenous ligand for these receptors is 17 -estradiol (E2), which is normally produced by the ovaries or through peripheral metabolism of precursor hormones (e.g., testosterone). However, ERs can also bind a diverse range of synthetic agonists and antagonists. In the past several years, it has been shown that certain compounds behave as ER agonists in some tissues and ER antagonists in others. These compounds with mixed activity are called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS; for review, see ref 1). The precise reason the same compound can have cell-specific effects has not been elucidated, but differences in receptor conformation, co-regulatory proteins, and promoters have all been suggested. A major advance toward understanding the differential effects of various estrogenic compounds came with the recent discovery of an additional form of the estrogen receptor.2 The second

isoform, called ER , is similar in sequence to the previously known isoform, now called ERR. Mapping the distribution of ER and ERR mRNA in normal and neoplastic tissues has provided an intriguing picture of differential expression patterns in different tissue types.3-6 The existence of clear-cut differences in receptor expression suggests that tissues could be differentially targeted with receptor selective ligands. In particular, the fact that ER is widely expressed but not the dominant estrogen receptor in uterus or breast tissues has made it a very attractive drug target. However, until very recently,7 any specific therapeutic utility of an ER selective ligand has been unclear. As described in ref 7, availability of highly selective ligands has enabled us to probe the physiological function of ER . For example, the ER selective agonist ERB-041 was used to demonstrate that this receptor may be a useful target for certain inflammatory diseases,7 while similar studies utilizing the ERR selective agonist propylpyrazole triol (PPT) showed that many classical estrogenic effects are mediated by ERR.8 In the current

Design of Estrogen Receptor- Selective Ligands

ARTICLES

paper we discuss our structure-based design approach to the design of highly ER selective agonists, which, along with traditional medicinal chemistry studies, has helped provide us with valuable tools such as ERB-041 to help elucidate the physiological role of ER . Like other nuclear receptors, estrogen receptors have a modular structure consisting of six discrete domains designated A-F. These domains mediate binding to DNA, ligands, and other proteins (e.g., coactivators).9,10 The E domain (ligand binding domain or "LBD") of ER binds ligands such as E2 and the phytoestrogen, genistein (GEN). Whereas E2 binds to both ERR and ER with similar affinity, phytoestrogens such as GEN have modest selectivity for the -subtype, having 10-40-fold greater affinity for ER than for ERR.2,11-13 Although the existence of naturally occurring ER selective ligands is both fortuitous and encouraging, the modest selectivity seen for phytoestrogens is not sufficient to validate ER as a target. Another major advance, which has paved the way for structure-based design of ER selective ligands, was the X-ray structure determination of the ER LBD complexed with GEN.14 This structure clearly showed that, although ERR and ER are 58% identical in sequence, in actuality there are only two residue substitutions in close proximity to bound agonists: ERR Leu384 is replaced by ER Met336, and ERR Met421 is replaced by ER Ile373. Given the conservative nature of these substitutions, it is not surprising that compounds such as E2 are nonselective, while the phytoestrogens achieve only modest selectivity. In fact, although it was suggested that the ERR Met421f ER Ile373 substitution may allow ER to accommodate more polar substituents,14 so far there has been no clear explanation for the observed selectivity of phytoestrogens such as GEN. The design of highly ER selective ligands has thus far proved to be quite challenging. Recently, several groups, including our own, have reported attempts to design ER selective ligands utilizing various scaffolds (e.g., biphenyls,15 tetrahydrochrysenes (THC),16-18 diarylpropionitriles (DPN),19,20 arylbenzothiophenes,21 isoxazoles,22,23 benzothiazoles/benzoxazoles,24,25 benzimidazoles,26 triazines,27 isoquinolines/isoindolines,28 steroidal29 and phytoestrogen analogues30-32). While some of these efforts have been successful at enhancing ER selectivity beyond 50-fold, many of the resulting compounds

have been on the order of 10-30-fold selective based on receptor binding. Several arguments of how compounds achieve selectivity have been presented, mostly based on docking calculations and mutation studies. However, to our knowledge, there have been no arguments presented supported by multiple X-ray structures within a congeneric series of ligands or by X-ray structures of the same molecule cocrystallized with both human ER and ERR. In this paper we describe X-ray crystallographic studies and structure-based optimization of a series of ER selective ligands. Using ab initio quantum mechanics, we demonstrate that certain functional groups incorporated during lead optimization are able to experience a differential interaction with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373 on the basis of both electrostatic and dispersive effects. Furthermore, we show that taking advantage of this residue substitution affords compounds with >100-fold ER binding selectivity relative to ERR.
Materials and Methods
Materials. Coactivator peptide fragments, Biotin-SGSHKLVQLLTTTCOOH and Biotin-SGHKILHRLLQEG-COOH were obtained from the Wyeth DNA and peptide synthesis lab. The two peptides used in this study were derived from the steroid receptor coactivator 1 and 3 (SRC-1 and SRC-3) NR box domains. SRC-1 and SRC-3 are both known to enhance ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of the estrogen receptor and have been shown to be specifically recruited by agonistbound ER and ERR, respectively.33,34 All ligands studied in this paper were obtained from the Wyeth compound library. Preparation of ERB-041 and related benzoxazole/ benzofuran compounds are described elsewhere.35-37 Binding affinities (as measured by IC50 in a solid-phase competitive radioligand binding assay using ER LBD and [3H]-17 -E2)11 for all compounds are provided in Table 1.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human ER LBD. Human ER cDNA was generated from human testis RNA by RTPCR and cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. Amino acids 261-500 were amplified from the cloned cDNA by PCR with the forward primer 5-GAACCATGGACGACGCCCTGAGCCCCGAGCAGCTAGTG-3 and the reverse primer 5-GGACTCGAGTTAGTCGTCAAGCACGTGGGCATTCAGCATCTC-3. The PCR fragment was inserted into E. coli expression vector pET16b (Novagen) between the NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. The primers used encode three extra asp codons, one before the codon for D261 and two after L500. The expressed LBD thus has the following sequence: MD[D261-L500]15108 J. AM. CHEM. SOC.

DD. ER LBD was overexpressed from a high-density culture of E. coli BL21DE3 host cells (Stratagene). The ER LBD was purified as follows. Harvested cells were lysed by two cycles of French press (SLM Instrument) at 20 000 psi in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 1 mM EDTA (10 mL/g of cells). Clarified lysate was flowed through a Q Sepharose (Pharmacia) column and then applied to a 5 mL estradiolSepharose fast flow column (PTI Research, Inc) and washed with 300 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5 containing 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM EDTA (buffer A). The column was then re-equilibrated with 50 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA (buffer B),

and then the protein was carboxymethylated using 50 mL of buffer B containing 5 mM iodoacetic acid. Then the column was washed by 500 mL of buffer A, followed by elution in buffer A containing 50200 µM ligand. The final step was size exclusion chromatography (Sephadex 200, Pharmacia) using the elution buffer containing 5 µM ligand. Excess ligand was finally removed by passing the solution through a G-25 column (Pharmacia). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Human ERr LBD. Amino acids 301-554 were amplified from human ovaries total RNA by RT-PCR using a forward primer of 5-GAATTCTCATGAGTAAGAAGAACAGCCTGGCCTT-3 and a reverse primer of 5-AGTTGGATCCTCGAGTCAGCTAGTGGGCGCATGTAGGCG-3. The amplification product was gel purified and digested with Rca I and Xho I for the purpose of cloning into pET16b. This fragment was introduced into pET16b that had been digested with NcoI and XhoI. Transformants containing the correct plasmid sequence were used for ERR LBD expression. The expressed ERR LBD has the following sequence: M[S301-S554]. The ERR LBD was overexpressed from a high-density culture of E. coli BL21DE3-RP host cells (Stratagene). The ERR LBD was purified by resuspending the cell pellet in a buffer of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 4 mM DTT (10 mL/g of cells). The cell suspension was disrupted by passing through a microfluidizer 5 times (model 110Y, Microfluidics Corp). After centrifugation (13 000 × g 30 min, 4 °C), the pellet was extracted with 4 M urea in the same buffer. The urea extract was applied to a 5 mL estradiol-Sepharose fast flow column (PTI Research, Inc). The column was first washed with 1 M urea in the above buffer and then sequentially washed with the following: (1) 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 700 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT; (2) 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.5, 250 mM NaSCN, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM DTT in 10% dimethylformamide; (3) 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. While the ERR LBD was bound to the estradiol-affinity column, carboxymethylation was performed by equilibrating the column with 5 mM iodoacetic acid in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 overnight at 4 °C. Protein was eluted with 100 µM ligand and desalted with a BioRad disposable desalting column equilibrated with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 7.5. Crystallography. The ER /WAY-397 complex was concentrated to 12.5 mg/mL in a buffer containing 0.2 M NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 5mM DTT, and 10mM Tris-HC1 at pH 7.5 and then mixed with the SRC-1 peptide at a molar ratio of 1.5:1 peptide to protein-ligand complex. Screening of crystallization conditions was performed at 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method.38 Crystals were grown from a drop containing a mixture of protein/ligand-peptide solution and reservoir solution of 25% PEG2000 (v/v), 0.15 M MgCl, 20 mM hexaminecobalt trichloride, and 0.1 M MES, pH 6.0. The ER /WAY-244 complex was concentrated to 10.0 mg/mL in the same buffer as the ER /WAY-397 complex and then mixed with the SRC-1 peptide at a molar ratio of 5:1 peptide to protein-ligand complex. Crystals were grown using the same technique as those above and appeared over wells containing 15% PEG3350 (v/v) and 0.15 M magnesium formate. The crystallization conditions for ER /WAY-697 and ER /ERB-041 were similar to those for ER /WAY-244, except that the molar ratio of peptide to protein-ligand complex was 1.5:1. The ERR/WAY-244 complex was concentrated to 11.0 mg/mL in a buffer containing 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at pH 7.5 and then mixed with the SRC-3 peptide at a molar ratio of 1.5:1.0 peptide to protein-ligand complex. Crystals were grown using the same technique as that above and appeared over wells containing 15% PEG3350 (v/ v), 0.2 M NaI, and 0.1 M HEPES at pH 7.4. Prior to data collection all crystals were briefly soaked in a solution containing mother liquor and 15-20% glycerol (v/v). X-ray data were collected at 100 K using a Quantum-4 CCD area detector at the Advanced Light Source (ALS, Berkeley, CA) and processed using DENZO and Scalepack.39 Crystal structures were solved

ARTICLES by molecular replacement using the program AMORE.40 All ER complex structures were solved using ER complexed with GEN as a search model. This ER /GEN structure was in turn solved in-house by molecular replacement, using ERR complexed with E2 as a model41 (pdb code: 1A52) and was later found to be in good agreement with the published structure14 (pdb code: 1QKM). The ERR/WAY-244 complex structure was solved using ERR complexed with DES42 (pdb code: 3ERD) as the search model. To avoid model bias, the ligand, the loop connecting H8-H9, the C and N terminal helices, and the coactivator peptide were omitted from the search models. For the ERR/ WAY-244 structure, Met421 was also omitted from the search model. Structures were refined using the program CNS.43 The resulting difference electron density maps show clear electron density for the compounds, residues within the binding site, helix 12, and the coactivator peptide. The final models of the ERR and ER complex crystal structures contain a dimer, with a ligand and coactivator peptide bound to each monomer, and a variable number of water molecules. Cysteine modifications and some flexible loop residues were not included in the models due to poor electron density. Table 2 gives the data collection and refinement details for all of the complexes studied. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with accession codes 1U9E (ER /WAY-397), 1X76 (ER /WAY-697), 1X7B (ER /ERB-041), 1X78 (ER /WAY-244), and 1X7E (ERR/WAY-244). Molecular Modeling. The docking methodology used here has been described in detail elsewhere.15 Briefly, docking calculations were performed using the QXP software package.44 After minimization of the X-ray ligand in the active site, constrained simulated annealing dynamics calculations were performed to relieve any artifacts of the X-ray refinement perceived as unfavorable interactions or strain by the QXP force field. Once the binding site model was generated, docking of analogues was performed using the QXP Monte Carlo docking algorithm mcdock. In general, 1000 Monte Carlo steps were sufficient for the poses and their energy scores to converge. Visualization of X-ray structures and docking results was performed using the InsightII software package (Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). All quantum chemical calculations were performed using the Jaguar software package (Jaguar 5.5; Schrodinger, LLC, Portland, OR). Intermolecular potential energy curves were calculated by constructing a z-matrix for both molecules and then varying the intermolecular distance while holding the relative orientation of the two molecules fixed. Molecular geometries were optimized at the LMP2 level of theory using the 6-311G**++ basis set.45-48 Potential energies were then calculated for the optimized structures using the augmented correlationconsistent polarized valence triple- (aug-cc-pVTZ) basis set,49-52 also at the LMP2 level of theory. The LMP2 (local Møller-Plesset secondorder perturbation theory) method was designed to incorporate the

effects of electron correlation while minimizing basis set superposition error (BSSE), which can lead to a dimer energy that is artificially lower than the sum of two monomer energies.53-57 Therefore, the method is ideally suited to calculate intermolecular interaction energies, without having to apply a counterpoise (CP) correction to the LMP2 term of the molecular energy. However, CP calculations are still necessary to obtain reliable energies for the Hartree-Fock (HF) term.58,59 This was done at every intermolecular distance by calculating each fragment's HF single-point energy using the basis functions of the dimer at that intermolecular distance. As a practical note, we do find that the 6-311G**++ basis set yields qualitatively similar results compared to aug-cc-pVTZ. However,

interaction energies tend to be lower with aug-cc-pVTZ, typically on the order of 0.5 kcal/mol lower when two molecules are in van der Waals contact. This is to be expected, since the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set is likely to do a better job saturating the dispersive component of the interaction, due to the addition of higher angular momentum polarization functions. We also point out that, in studies of the HF dimer,60 individual components of the interaction energy tended to differ a considerable amount from the basis set limit for the commonly used basis sets such as 6-311G**. In particular, the electrostatic component at the correlated level tended to have a significant amount of error, although this was mitigated to some extent when diffuse functions (+) were added. Since we were concerned about interpreting results based on a "fortuitous cancellation of errors," we decided to report energies calculated using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set.

After performing a preliminary structural alignment based on all alpha-carbons, we used the superimpose_aln command to generate matches based on fitting only alpha-carbons closer than 2.00 Å. This ensured that conformational changes in highly flexible regions such as loops did not exert an undesired influence on the overlays. Small molecule overlays were performed using the program Maestro (Maestro 6.0 Schrodinger, LLC, Portland, OR). Electron density maps were displayed using the Quanta software package (Quanta 2000; Accelrys, Inc, San Diego, CA). Statistical Significance of Selectivity Differences. Ultimately, we would like to know when two selectivities are different to a certain level of confidence. This is of the utmost importance when trying to understand whether a certain interaction observed in a crystal structure is truly modulating the selectivity. To determine whether two selectivities are indeed "different", we must first understand how the ERR and ER potency measurements are distributed. In general, we find that the IC50 measurements most closely follow a log-normal distribution. Therefore, the small-sample confidence interval for n IC50 determinations can be determined on a logarithmic scale using the Student t-distribution:

Now that we have the variance s2 and degrees of freedom df ) na + nb - 2 for ln(s), we can compare the selectivities of two compounds, ln(s1) and ln(s2), and calculate the variance of the difference:

where   denotes an arithmetic mean of n measurements,  is the standard deviation of ln(IC50), and tR/2 is the t value with an area of R/2 (under the t sampling distribution) to its right, based on n - 1 degrees of freedom. The level of confidence is given by 100 - R. Exponentiation of the arithmetic mean of ln(IC50) then yields the geometric mean IC50, and adding or subtracting the confidence interval before exponentiation yields the upper and lower confidence limits for the mean. If we denote the selectivity s as a ratio of two geometric mean values a and b, the selectivity on a logarithmic scale can then be written as a j h difference between two arithmetic means:

ln(s) ) ln(a) - ln(b)

To determine a confidence interval for the selectivity, it is important to correctly propagate the degrees of freedom originating from individual potency measurements. To this end, we chose to utilize a pooled sample variance64 to calculate the error in ln(s). The pooled sample variance s2 for ln(s) is given by

General Observations. The overall ER and ERR LBD structures are similar to those previously reported,14,42,62,63 and thus they will not be described in detail here. We do want to comment that in all cases the helix-12 conformation corresponds to that observed for other bound agonists,42,62,63,65 consistent with our goal of designing an ER selective agonist. Briefly, the ligand is completely excluded from the solvent by the position of helix H12, which "closes" over the binding pocket and projects the hydrophobic side chains of ER residues Leu491 and Leu495 (Leu539 and Leu543 in ERR) toward the bound ligand. The closing of H12 over the ligand binding pocket also forms a cavity on the surface of the LBD, formed by helices H3, H4, H5, and H12 and the turn between H3 and H4. The coactivator fragment binds to this cavity in an R-helical conformation, in a manner similar to what has been previously described for other ERR LBD complexes (see Figure 1).42,63,65 Unbiased electron density difference maps unambiguously define the ligand binding mode for all complexes studied, as shown in Figure 2. For all of the ligands, the phenol mimics the E2 "A-ring." In particular, the phenolic hydroxyl (4-OH) is involved in a hydrogen bonding network between ER residues Glu305 and Arg346 (ERR residues Glu353 and Arg394) and a highly ordered water molecule. Another hydrogen bond is formed between the benzofuran/benzoxazole hydroxyl (5OH) and N1 of ER His475 (ERR His524). The core scaffold, consisting of the A-ring phenyl, and the benzofuran/benzoxazole B and C rings, fills the remainder of the primarily hydrophobic pocket. For WAY-397 and WAY-244, the A and B rings are approximately coplanar, while, for WAY-697 and ERB-041, the A-B ring dihedral angles differ significantly from zero (32° and 23°, respectively). Quantum mechanical evaluation of the energy with respect to the A-B ring dihedral66 shows that the energetic profiles are similar for the 2-phenyl benzofuran and 2-phenyl benzoxazole. The minimum is near 0 °, and the energy rises somewhat slowly as the dihedral angle increases. Given the "flatness" of the potential energy curve, significantly

noncoplanar geometries (20° for 2-phenyl benzoxazole, 30° for 2-phenyl benzofuran) are readily induced (j0.6 kcal/mol penalty) by steric interactions between the substituent at the benzofuran/benzoxazole 7-position and nearby pocket residues. Opportunities To Improve Selectivity. Examination of the ER complex with WAY-397, a 29-fold ER selective compound, revealed a clear opportunity to improve selectivity by targeting the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution (see Figure 3a). As shown in Figure 3b, the 7-position of the benzofuran ring was found to overlay well with the GEN 5-OH group, which we felt might experience electrostatic repulsion with the ERR Met421 side chain based on docking calculations and overlays with ERR/E2 or ERR/DES, thus contributing to the modest ER selectivity of GEN. Therefore, we felt that this would be the best position to explore with functional groups. Docking the corresponding benzoxazole WAY-818 (see Table 1) revealed a nearly perfect overlay with WAY-397, which suggested a means to access the same pocket from the analogous benzoxazole 7-position, but with significant differences in synthetic accessibility.35 The proximity between the GEN 5-OH group and ERR Met421 S atom alluded to above suggested to us that electronegative and chemically hard (i.e., nonpolarizable) groups would be more likely to experience a repulsive interaction with the ERR Met421 side chain. In contrast, docking of the ERR selective ligand 16Riodo-E2 places an iodine atom in close proximity to ERR Met421,67 leading us to hypothesize that aliphatic and chemically soft (i.e., polarizable) groups would be more likely to have an attractive interaction involving the S atom of ERR Met421. These both seemed like reasonable expectations due to the partial negative charge and polarizability of the methionine S atom.

For example, when a chemically hard functional group directs one or more electronegative atoms toward the S atom, electrostatic repulsion is unlikely to be offset by dispersive or inductive interactions, because it would be more difficult to further induce polarization in the chemically hard group. In contrast, aliphatic and chemically soft groups (e.g., the iodine of 16R-iodo-E2) will have significant dispersive and inductive interactions with S, which have the potential to offset any electrostatic repulsion. These effects would not be expected with the purely hydrophobic side chain of ER Ile373, making a chemically hard functional group containing electronegative atoms a more attractive synthetic target than others with regard to improving ER selectivity. Quantum Chemical Calculations. Unfortunately, the balance between dispersive, inductive, and electrostatic interactions for a given functional group interacting with a residue side chain is difficult to estimate without performing ab initio quantum chemical calculations. Such calculations were quite valuable in that they allowed us to evaluate the likelihood of functional groups to have a differential interaction with ERR Met421 versus ER Ile373. For the scaffolds discussed here, we found that only groups capable of having such a differential interaction were successful at enhancing ER selectivity beyond 100-fold, although we point out that this differential interaction does not necessarily guarantee that the ligand will be more selective, nor is it an absolute prerequisite for a >100-fold selective ligand. For example, depending on how the functional group is presented to the pocket, it may experience unfavorable interactions with both ERR Met421 and ER Ile373. Or, if the functional group and/or ERR Met421 can readjust in response to an unfavorable interaction without paying any significant penalty (e.g., entropic or internal strain), then it may lead to improved affinity for both isoforms. Alternatively, functional groups that do not exhibit a differential electronic interaction with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373 over a significant region of space could still conceivably lead to improved selectivity by virtue of differential steric repulsion or differences in contact distance (e.g., if somehow optimal contact was made with ER Ile373 but not with ERR Met421). However, we feel that there are fewer opportunities for selectivity improvement via this mechanism, given the flexibility of the methionine side chain. Herein, we will focus on the results of quantum chemical calculations for two functional groups, nitrile and vinyl, which have been successful at enhancing ER selectivity beyond 100fold when incorporated at the 7-position of the benzofuran/ benzoxazole scaffold. A full SAR discussion for these scaffolds is presented elsewhere.35,37 Figure 4a shows a schematic representation of how the functional groups and their interaction with the residue side chains were modeled. Figure 4b shows how the potential energy of CH3CN varies as a function of distance from dimethyl sulfide (a model for the methionine side chain). Also shown is the potential energy curve for the same group interacting with a propyl group. Since the two curves differ only in the substitution of methylene for sulfur, this sort of analysis can help us understand which groups are most likely to experience repulsive interactions with S of ERR Met421 relative to the C1 of ER Ile373, thus enabling the group to differentiate between the two side chains without having to take advantage of differences in size or shape. Of course, in reality

When nitrile approaches the sulfur atom end-on with the nitrogen closest to the sulfur atom, the dipole moments have a "tail-to-tail" relative orientation, which represents a purely repulsive interaction. In this case, dispersive and inductive effects are clearly not strong enough to offset the electrostatic repulsion (dipole-dipole as well as higher order), since the interaction of nitrile with dimethyl sulfide in Figure 4b is purely repulsive. Similarly, for the case of ethylene approaching the sulfur atom on its side, dispersive and inductive effects are insufficient to offset the weak electrostatic repulsion (in this case dominated by the dipole-quadrupole interaction) between the two moieties, leading to the repulsive potential energy curve shown in Figure 4c. For both ethylene and nitrile, the interaction with a propyl group is likely to be dominated by dispersive and inductive interactions and is therefore attractive in both cases. Clearly, these results are expected to be dependent on the relative orientation of the interacting partners. For instance, nitrile can alternatively have a weakly attractive interaction with dimethyl sulfide if it approaches the sulfur atom on its side, with the CtN: carbon and nitrogen equidistant to the sulfur atom (curve not shown). This is expected because, for a perfect "T-like" relative orientation of the nitrile and dimethyl sulfide dipoles, the dipole-dipole interaction is identically zero. Since the leading term in the electrostatic interaction is diminished, dispersion and induction can become the dominant interactions, leading to a net attraction.68 This is consistent with the proposed mechanism of ER selectivity for DPN, where nitrile is believed to enhance selectivity by interacting favorably with ER Met336.19,20 The dependence of such interactions on relative orientation highlights the fact that care must be taken when designing ligands to ensure that functional groups are directed into the pocket at the appropriate angles. 7-Substituted Benzofuran and Benzoxazole Analogues. Initial attempts to enhance ER selectivity resulted in WAY697, which exhibited little improvement relative to WAY-397 (see Table 1). Cocrystallization studies verified that the nitrile group of this compound extends into the small pocket formed by residues Met340, Phe356, Ile373, Ile376, Phe377, and Leu380, placing it in close proximity to the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution, as shown in Figure 2b. However, we felt that the group might not be directed into the pocket deeply enough or at the appropriate angle to lead to a significantly different interaction with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373. A modest enhancement in ER selectivity was obtained for the 7-carbonitrile benzoxazole, WAY-292 (geometric mean ) 71fold). Differences in selectivity for 7-substituted benzofuran compounds and the corresponding 7-substituted benzoxazoles can be attributed to subtle differences in scaffold geometry. This will be discussed in greater detail below. Two strategies were utilized to direct functional groups at the benzofuran/benzoxazole 7-position more deeply into the ERR Met421/ER Ile373 pocket: (1) constraining the bond and dihedral angles that determine the relative orientation of the A and B rings and (2) inserting an sp2 or sp3 hybridized linker between the functional group and the benzofuran/benzoxazole ring system. Analogues utilizing both of these strategies were
(68) Even for this "T-like" relative orientation, we find that the interaction between dimethyl sulfide and acetonitrile is about the same as the interaction between propyl and acetonitrile, given the same intermolecular distance.

evaluated with docking calculations, and functional groups were chosen based on fit to the pocket, likelihood of the group having a differential interaction with methionine versus isoleucine, and synthetic accessibility. The first strategy resulted in the design of WAY-358, a 157fold ER selective molecule. Figure 5 shows WAY-358 docked to the ER /WAY-697 binding site. Clearly, the nitrile of WAY358 is directed more deeply into the ERR Met421/ER Ile373 pocket relative to WAY-697. Furthermore, due to the conformational constraint, the nitrile is likely to spend a greater percentage of time near these residues, which should magnify the effect of its differential interaction with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373 (although alignment of the nitrile with respect to these residues is most likely still far from optimal). As a result, the ERR potency is reduced relative to that of WAY-697, while the ER potency is slightly improved. We point out that WAY358 appears shifted in the pocket relative to WAY-697, which is primarily due to steric interactions between the constraining ethyl moiety and the pocket residues. Therefore, both the constrained ligand geometry and the shift in the pocket should be considered responsible for positioning the nitrile closer to the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution. Two analogues were designed utilizing the second strategy: WAY-244, a benzofuran with a 7-acetonitrile group, and WAY659, a benzoxazole with a 7-vinyl group. The 76-fold ER selectivity of WAY-244 appears primarily due to a decrease in ERR potency, which is consistent with the positioning of the nitrile nitrogen more deeply in the pocket relative to WAY697. However, the improvement in selectivity is still modest compared to that of WAY-358. One possible reason for this is that the acetonitrile group is somewhat strained in the ER structure, leading to a slight reduction in ER affinity as well. In addition, we feel that the nitrile of WAY-244 may still not be optimally aligned to take advantage of the differential interaction we predict with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373 (see Figure 4b). This will be discussed further below. Analogue WAY-659 is 127-fold ER selective, which is the result of an approximately 16-fold improvement in the ER affinity, along with a 3-fold improvement in the ERR affinity (affinities relative to those of WAY-818). The improvement in affinity for both isoforms is most likely due to a favorable overall hydrophobic effect, although the significantly smaller improvement in the ERR potency is consistent with the "nonattractive" potential we

For ligands with simple unsubstituted phenols, the A-ring overlap is very good when our ER crystal structures are overlayed by CR atoms, consistent with the fact that the A-ring interaction with Glu305 and Arg346 is critical for binding. However, we emphasize that the "perfect" A-ring overlap shown here is not intended to mimic the overlaying of crystal structures. The purpose of this figure is to highlight the subtle structural differences between the benzofuran and benzoxazole scaffolds, providing one possible explanation for divergences in SAR. The shift of the 7-vinyl group is primarily due to an opening up of the bond angle shown.

predict between the 7-vinyl group and ERR Met421, relative to a weak attraction with ER Ile373. Interestingly, although the corresponding 7-vinyl benzofuran WAY-354 has a nearly identical ER potency, the ERR potency is approximately 5-fold better, leading to a 6-fold less selective compound. This can be rationalized by overlaying WAY-659 with WAY-354, shown in Figure 6. One can see from this overlay that there is a subtle difference in scaffold geometry, primarily due to opening up of the benzofuran-phenyl bond angle shown in Figure 6, which in turn is probably a result of steric repulsion between the ortho hydrogen atoms and the larger size of the sp2 carbon at the benzofuran 3-position relative to the corresponding benzoxazole nitrogen. Although this difference seems small, it leads to a shift of as much as 0.5 Å in the 7-vinyl atomic positions. Given the sensitivity of the interaction energy to intermolecular separation at close distances, we speculate that this shift could readily lead to a 5-fold change in ERR affinity, which corresponds to a free energy difference of only 0.95 kcal/mol. A similar divergence in SAR was seen for the acetonitrile group (data not shown), except in this case the ER and ERR potencies were both reduced for the benzoxazole scaffold relative to the benzofuran scaffold. As mentioned above, selectivities greater than 100-fold were only observed for functional groups capable of forming a differential electronic interaction with the ERR Met421 side chain relative to the purely aliphatic side chain of ER Ile373. Groups that do not experience a significant differential interaction (e.g., aliphatic groups) in the same pocket typically lead to either lesser or no improvement, or sometimes even a detrimental effect on ER selectivity. For example, a 7-ethyl group, which was confirmed to occupy the ER Ile373 pocket by cocrystallization studies, led to no significant change in selectivity for either the benzofuran or benzoxazole scaffold.35 Fluoro Group Ortho to A-Ring Hydroxyl Enhances ER Selectivity.

WAY-659 to development candidate ERB-041,7,35 which has a geometric mean ER selectivity of 256-fold.69 An X-ray structure of ER complexed with ERB-041 confirmed that the 7-vinyl group does indeed extend into the ERR Met421/ER Ile373 pocket, as shown in Figures 2d and 7. Interestingly, ERB-041 is 2-fold more selective than WAY-659, yet it differs from WAY-659 by only a single fluoro group ortho to the A-ring hydroxyl. We have also observed this selectivity enhancement for ortho-fluoro substituents on other scaffolds as well.15,37 Although estrogen receptor binding in general is known to be tolerant of A-ring halogen substitution,70 to our knowledge there have been no other reports of any effects on ER /ERR selectivity. The selectivity improvement for ERB-041 relative to WAY659 is primarily due to a 2.7-fold reduction in ERR potency. We point out that although the effect of the ortho-fluoro group on ER selectivity is small, it is indeed statistically significant at up to 99% confidence, as shown in Table 3. However, the mechanism behind the ERR potency reduction and the resulting selectivity change is difficult to understand, since the X-ray structure of ER complexed with ERB-041 reveals that the residues closest to the fluorine atom (Leu343, Met340, and Leu339) are conserved when comparing ERR to ER . One possibility may be that the fluorine is only 2.8 Å from the carbonyl oxygen of Leu339, which represents a repulsive interaction.71
(69) As discussed in the Materials and Methods section, we chose to work with geometric mean values in order to obtain confidence intervals for the difference between selectivities on a logarithmic scale. However, to avoid confusion with previously reported results, we point out that the selectivity of ERB-041 based on the ratio of arithmetic mean potency values is actually 226-fold. (70) Anstead, G. M.; Carlson, K. E.; Katzenellenbogen, J. A. Steroids 1997, 62, 268-303. (71) We point out that the alternative position of the fluorine atom would place it in close proximity to the carboxylic acid of Glu305, which would represent an even stronger repulsive interaction.

Figure 8. ER complexed with ERB-041 (colored by atom type), overlaid with ER /WAY-244, ER /WAY-697, and ER /WAY-397 (magenta). Only key residues are shown for simplicity. The ligands and residues from both monomer units are shown. The close proximity of the ERB-041 fluoro group and the backbone carbonyl of Leu339 appears to shift the ligand scaffold slightly relative to the others, placing the 7-vinyl group closer to the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution.

Upon overlay of the ER /ERB-041 structure with the other ER structures discussed above, it appears that this repulsion shifts the A-ring by up to 0.45 Å, as shown in Figure 8. Once the shift has occurred, the remaining repulsion is probably offset by the electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine, which would tend to polarize the phenolic OH group and improve the interaction with Glu305 and Arg346. However, the shift also tends to position the 7-vinyl group more deeply into the ERR Met421/ ER Ile373 pocket. Given that a 2-fold change in selectivity corresponds to only a 0.4 kcal/mol free energy difference, it is quite reasonable to expect that such a small shift could be responsible for the selectivity improvement. This is not unlike the shift of WAY-358 relative to WAY-697 discussed above. It is also possible that the shift modulates the differential interaction between the B-ring and ER Met336 relative to ERR Leu384. An ER -Selective Ligand Cocrystallized with ERr. To further understand the mechanism for enhancing ER selectivity in this series, we cocrystallized WAY-244 with ERR. Despite the relatively low resolution of the structure, we felt that the electron density difference maps were adequate to make some general conclusions about the ligand binding mode (see Figure 2e). First, overlaying the structures of ERR and ER , both complexed with WAY-244, reveals that the binding mode is essentially identical in both isoforms, as shown in Figure 9. The B-ring (furan) is approximately 4.2 Å from ER Met336 C , which is about 2 Å closer than the distance to ERR Leu384 C1. This difference serves to highlight the better contact between the B-ring and ER Met336 relative to ERR Leu384, which we propose contributes significantly to what we term the "core selectivity" seen for compounds containing bicyclic heteroaryl groups in the B-C ring region of the ligand,14,23-26 as well as for biphenyls.15 However, for the purposes of the current paper, we intend to focus on the mechanism by which certain functional groups enhance ER selectivity relative to the core scaffold.72 Therefore, we defer a discussion on the exact
(72) Based on quantum chemical calculations similar to those presented in this paper, we find that the B-ring is able to interact more favorably with ER Met336 relative to ERR Leu384. A detailed explanation of this contribution to "core selectivity" will be presented elsewhere.

Distance monitors show the proximity of the 7-acetonitrile group to ERR Met421/ER Ile373. Interaction with Phe425/Phe377 appears to induce a strained acetonitrile conformation in both structures. In ERR, we hypothesize that this strain may increase slightly to achieve a more optimal interaction with Met421. Interaction between the acetonitrile and Phe425 may also be affected by the presence of Met421.

mechanism and magnitude of this contribution to core selectivity to an upcoming paper. Although we feel confident that the acetonitrile group does indeed occupy the ERR Met421/ER Ile373 pocket, the low resolution of the ERR/WAY-244 structure makes it difficult for us to say anything conclusive about the exact mechanism of selectivity enhancement. Fortunately, knowing that the acetonitrile occupies the same pocket in both isoforms in roughly the same conformation does allow us to form several hypotheses regarding how this functional group leads to enhanced ER selectivity. The most obvious mechanism would be any direct differential interaction of the acetonitrile with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373, given the close proximity of these moieties. Considering the observed intermolecular distances shown in Figure 9, one might think that the differential interaction we predict between the nitrile and ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373 (see Figure 4b) would be capable of contributing as much as 20-fold to the ER selectivity. However, based on the observed relative orientations of these moieties, this contribution is likely to be greatly diminished, consistent with the limited improvement in ER selectivity for WAY-244 relative to WAY-397. Another contribution we considered is that ERR Met421 interferes with the interaction between acetonitrile and Phe425, whereas in ER the acetonitrile can form a weak CH- - -N hydrogen bond with Phe377 (see Figure 9). Interestingly, the acetonitrile group appears significantly strained in both the ERR and ER structures. The primary reason for this appears to be steric interactions with ERR Phe425/ER

Phe377, which is also what prevents the acetonitrile from being optimally aligned to take maximal advantage of the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution. This observation is consistent with the reduced affinity of WAY-244 for both isoforms relative to WAY-397. Given that we expect the ligand energy to be more sensitive to small changes in geometry when the ligand is strained compared to when the ligand geometry is at an energy minimum, we considered the possibility that differences in strain energy might contribute to ER selectivity. We hypothesize that any additional strain induced in ERR is due to repulsion between the Met421 side chain and the acetonitrile group. For example, the C7a-C7-Csp3-Csp dihedral angle is about 60° in the ER structure and about 50° in the ERR structure. This small movement is clearly beyond the resolution of the structures, so we stress that this only represents a starting point to examine the effect of subtle changes in the average ligand geometry. According to quantum chemical calculations,73 the strain energy corresponding to a dihedral angle of 50° is greater than that corresponding to a dihedral angle of 60° by about 0.5 kcal/ mol. This energy difference corresponds to a 2.3-fold relative potency shift, which would represent a substantial contribution to the 2.7-fold improvement in selectivity observed for WAY244 relative to WAY-397. Thus, even if the acetonitrile is oriented with respect to ERR Met421 such that the repulsion between the two moieties is completely eliminated, it is reasonable to expect that the resulting increase in ligand strain could contribute significantly to the selectivity.
Discussion

The mechanism by which ER selectivity can be achieved is generally not thoroughly explained in the literature. There are only two conservative residue substitutions in the ligand binding pocket: ER Met336 is substituted by ERR Leu384, and ER Ile373 is substituted by ERR Met421. It appears that interactions between ER Met336 and the benzofuran or benzoxazole ring of the analogues discussed above impart some degree of core selectivity. However, these interactions are unable to produce more than 30-fold ER selectivity on their own. We find that groups targeting the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution are capable of enhancing ER selectivity. Furthermore, selectivities greater than 100-fold were only observed for functional groups that appear capable of forming a differential electronic interaction with the methionine side chain relative to a purely aliphatic side chain. Groups that do not appear able to form a significant differential interaction (e.g., aliphatic groups) in the same pocket typically lead to either lesser or no improvement, or sometimes even a detrimental effect on ER selectivity. A semiquantitative understanding of this differential interaction was provided by quantum chemical calculations, which supported our original hypothesis that chemically hard functional groups containing atoms that carry a partial negative charge would be more likely to experience a repulsive interaction with the chemically soft and electronegative methionine sulfur atom. Clearly, the flexibility of the functional group and that of the methionine side chain both play a strong role in determining the observed selectivity of the compound. The state of the complex observed in a cocrystal structure should reflect the lowest energy state(s) of the entire system. If a functional group introduced to a ligand scaffold experiences a repulsive interaction with the ERR Met421 side chain, then the ligand and/or

protein will adjust (if possible) to lower the total energy of the complex. This might consist of the ligand adopting a different binding mode, including changes in position, orientation, and conformation. Likewise, the repulsive interaction might lead to changes in the protein conformation, most likely a change in the rotamer state of the methionine side chain. Since we are considering changes in potency on the order of no more than 10-fold, corresponding to a binding free-energy change of 1.37 kcal/mol at 25 °C, it is more likely that subtle changes will be observed. For example, we hypothesized that interaction between the acetonitrile group of WAY-244 and the ERR Met421 side chain may lead to a slight change in the acetonitrile conformation, which in turn is likely to alleviate any repulsive interaction between the two moieties. However, this subtle conformational change is likely to translate into increased ligand strain, which would lead to a significant decrease in ERR binding affinity relative to ER . Unfortunately, due to the presence of ERR Phe425/ER Phe377, the acetonitrile is unable to align itself to take optimal advantage of the differential interaction we predict with ERR Met421 relative to ER Ile373. Thus we obtain only a modest improvement in ER selectivity for the acetonitrile. For WAY-659 and ERB-041, differential interaction of the vinyl functional group with a methionine versus aliphatic side chain is predicted to be somewhat small compared to that of acetonitrile. In fact, the difference between the two curves shown in Figure 4c reaches a maximum of 0.98 kcal/mol at an intermolecular separation of 3.8 Å. Based on the crystal structure of ER complexed with ERB-041, it is clear that the vinyl group fits tightly into a groove formed by the side chains of residues Ile373, Ile376, and Phe377, and thus there is not much room for the vinyl group to move with respect to ER Ile373, and most likely with respect to ERR Met421 as well. Interestingly, the distance from the ethylene centroid to ER Ile373 C1 is about 4.0 Å, very close to the distance at which the differential interaction between methionine and isoleucine is predicted to be a maximum. If ERR Met421 adopts a rotamer similar to that observed in the ERR/E2 or ERR/WAY-244 crystal structures (see Figure 7), then the 0.98 kcal/mol difference in interaction energy will be maintained, apart from a small zero-point energy correction. Since it only takes about this much energy to take a 24-fold selective molecule like WAY-818 to a 127-fold selective molecule like WAY-659 (a 5.3-fold change in selectivity corresponds to a 0.99 kcal/mol difference in binding free energy), the differential interaction experienced by the vinyl group would be consistent with the observed improvement in selectivity. Thus, although this differential interaction is smaller than the maximum differential interaction we predict for acetonitrile, the vinyl group of WAY-659/ERB-041 is both more optimally aligned and less likely to readjust in order to take maximal advantage of the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution. As a result, the vinyl group leads to a greater improvement in selectivity. It appears that relatively small but statistically significant contributions to the selectivity due to interaction with conserved regions of the binding site may also occur, as was demonstrated with the ortho fluoro substituent of ERB-041. To provide an explanation for this phenomenon, we pointed out that a repulsive interaction between the fluoro group and the backbone carbonyl of Leu339 appears to "push" the 7-vinyl group more deeply into the ERR Met421/ER Ile373 pocket and realign the B-ring with respect to ERR Leu384/ER Met336. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a differential interaction might also occur

due to a significant number of residue substitutions outside of the immediate binding site (>5 Å), which in turn affect the equilibrium position and energetics of the backbone carbonyl within the binding pocket. We emphasize that such effects are not direct "long-range" effects, but rather they originate from one or more relatively distant residue substitutions, which propagate to the ligand either by shifting a residue within the binding site in one isoform relative to the other or by making it energetically possible for the ligand to induce such a shift. For WAY-358, the improvement in selectivity relative to WAY-697 appears to be due to a combination of several factors: a change in equilibrium geometry and increased rigidity associated with the constraining ethyl moiety, and a shift of the ligand due to steric interactions between the ethyl moiety and the pocket residues. This last contribution is similar to our explanation for the mechanism of selectivity enhancement for the ERB-041 fluoro group, except in this case steric interactions between the ethyl bridge and pocket residues Ala302 and Leu298 cause the shift, rather than electrostatic repulsion between the fluoro group and a backbone carbonyl. In our discussion of the ERR/WAY-244 crystal structure, we mentioned that the aryl interaction with ER Met336 in bicyclic heteroaryl scaffolds appears to contribute about an order of magnitude to the baseline selectivity. A logical question to ask is whether such scaffolds take maximal advantage of the ERR Leu384 f ER Met336 residue substitution. For instance, why not attempt to form an additional interaction with ER Met336, such as a hydrogen bond to the S atom, since this type of interaction was also found to be responsible for the RAR selectivity of certain retinoids possessing an alcohol or oxime moiety?74-79 It turns out that, due to the planar geometry of the bicyclic heteroaryl scaffold, none of the substitutable positions afforded easy access to the ER Met336 S atom. Furthermore, even if we were able to find another scaffold that presented better opportunities to access ER Met336, such hydrogen bonds are expected to be very sensitive to the relative position and orientation of the donor and acceptor. If the interaction is not optimal, desolvation of an alcohol or oxime would thus tend to lower the affinity for both ERR and ER . The other option would be to gain an attractive interaction with the ER Met336 S atom via a soft-soft interaction, similar to the interaction proposed between this residue and DPN19,20 or between 16R-iodo E2 and ERR Met421.67 However, we felt that this type of interaction would be unlikely to significantly improve upon the interaction we were already making with our current scaffolds. The benzofuran/benzoxazole scaffold provided the additional opportunity to take advantage of the ERR Met421 f ER Ile373 residue substitution by a combination of both steric and electronic effects, allowing for a much greater potential to develop SAR with a variety of functional groups. Our goal of designing an ER selective agonist added another level of difficulty to the simpler problem of designing an ER selective ligand. The observation that ER is easier to antagonize than ERR further complicates the design process.14 The

approach we chose to address this issue was to design ligands within the confines of an "agonist-like" pocket, in which helix12 is closed over the binding cavity as described above. Earlier crystallography studies indicated that helix-12 of ER maintains an agonist-like conformation when WAY-397 is bound to the receptor, regardless of whether a coactivator peptide fragment was utilized in the crystallization process80 (this is in contrast to the behavior of ER complexed with GEN, where helix-12 adopts an antagonist-like conformation in the absence of a coactivator peptide fragment14). In addition, the results of a cellbased transcriptional assay7 measuring up-regulation of insulinlike growth factor binding protein-4 mRNA indicate that WAY397 behaves as both an ER and ERR agonist. This suggested to us that the ligand binding pocket of ER /WAY-397 was a good starting point for structure-based design. Likewise, ER complexed with the final development compound ERB-041 also showed that helix-12 continued to adopt an agonist-like conformation, allowing for the binding of a coactivator fragment. Again, this is consistent with the fact that ERB-041 behaves as a full agonist on ER and ERR7. We emphasize that this only demonstrates that the structures are consistent with the observed functional activity of the compounds. However, one should not generally expect the position of helix-12 to be fully predictive of functional activity, since other factors such as the binding of the coactivator fragment itself and crystal packing also make a contribution to the overall energetics of the crystal. Ultimately, we feel that the helix-12 conformation should only be used to provide a structural basis for why a compound may have reduced functional efficacy (i.e. partial agonist) or full antagonist behavior. In our case there was no issue, since the compounds of interest demonstrated not only ER selectivity but also an agonist-like helix-12 conformation, consistent with their measured functional activity.
Conclusions

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that structure-based design affords ligands with >100-fold ER selectivity relative to ERR. Multiple X-ray cocrystal structures of modestly selective ligands complexed to both ERR and ER , in conjunction with docking calculations, were utilized to take advantage of a single conservative residue substitution in the ligand binding pocket, ERR Met421 f ER Ile373, to optimize ER selectivity. Quantum chemical calculations were also used to provide an understanding of how certain functional groups might experience a differential interaction with ER Ile373 relative to ERR Met421. These structure-based design methods have helped lead to the discovery of compounds such as ERB-041, a >200-fold ER selective agonist,7 providing a tool to elucidate the physiological role of ER .
