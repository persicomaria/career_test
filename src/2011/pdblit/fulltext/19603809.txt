The discovery of a novel class of inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) is described. Starting from compound 1, showing good potency as inhibitor of CDKs but being poorly selective against a panel of serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases, new analogues were synthesized. Enhancement in selectivity, antiproliferative activity against A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells, and optimization of the physical properties and pharmacokinetic profile led to the identification of highly potent and orally available compounds. Compound 28 (PHA-848125), which in the preclinical xenograft A2780 human ovarian carcinoma model showed good efficacy and was well tolerated upon repeated daily treatments, was identified as a drug candidate for further development. Compound 28 is currently undergoing phase I and phase II clinical trials.

Introduction Cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs ) are a family of serine/ threonine kinases that, in concert with cyclins (positive regulators) and natural inhibitors (CDKI), play a crucial role in the cell cycle progression.1 Deregulation of the activity of CDKs, due to alterations of expression and/or genetic mutations of cyclins, CDKs, CDKIs, and other components of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway, has been reported in more than 90% of human neoplasms. For example, cyclins E and A have been found overexpressed in 50% of breast and lung cancer whereas decreased levels of the inhibitor p27 indicate a poor prognosis in breast, prostate, colon, gastric, lung, and esophageal cancer.2 The high frequency of alterations found in the core members of this pathway in human tumors led to the suggestion that its deregulation, leading to increased activity of CDK/cyclin complexes, is an obligatory event for the development of all human cancers. Despite

recent genetic studies in mice indicating that normal cells are not dependent on interphase CDKs (CDK4 and CDK2) for their growth, certain tumor cells, depending on their origin and their pathogenic spectrum of mutation, may be sensitive to the inhibition of CDKs.1 Several small molecules inhibitors of CDKs are in clinical development. Among the first generation of CDK inhibitors, flavopiridol has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.3 A second generation of inhibitors with greater selectivity for CDKs such as roscovitine/CYC-202,4 BMS-387032/SNS-0325 (both mainly CDK2 but also CDK7 and CDK9 inhibitors), PD03329916 (selective CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor), and recently R5477 (CDK1, -2, -4 inhibitor), SCH-7279658 (CDK1, -2, -5, -9 inhibitor), AT75199 (CDK1, -2, -4, -5 inhibitor), and AZD559710 (CDK1, -2, and -9 inhibitor) suggest that agents that inhibit the function of multiple CDKs may be clinically more successful than very selective inhibitors of CDKs. We recently reported on a series of benzodipyrazoles11 as CDK2 inhibitors (Figure 1). As a further development of the fused pyrazole ring systems, we identified a novel series of pyrazolo[4,3-h]quinazoline-3-carboxamides as CDK inhibitors. Preliminary expansion of this class led to compound 1 that, notwithstanding being a potent inhibitor of CDKs, was poorly selective against a panel of serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases (see Experimental Session, Kinase Assays). The remarkable antiproliferative activity of this compound against A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells and the potency on CDKs prompted us to start a medicinal chemistry program with the aim of optimizing its profile with respect to selectivity, physicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetic profile.

Structural information was used to support the development of this class. Specifically, the crystal structure of CDK2/ cyclin A complexed with carboxylic acid 2 was solved (Figure 2). This compound, which shows a similar potency but is more soluble than compound 1, binds in the ATP pocket of the active conformation of the kinase: the pyrazoloquinazoline ring system occupies the adenine region of the ATP pocket, while the phenyl moiety points toward the solvent accessible region. Compound 2 makes two hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone of the hinge region: the N atom at position 7 of the pyrazoloquinazoline core interacts with the backbone NH of Leu83, while the adjacent amino group binds to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu83. In addition, the carboxylate group of the ligand is within hydrogen bonding distance of the conserved lysine (Lys33).

Chemistry The synthetic approach to this class of compounds12 (Scheme 1) started from commercially available 1,2-cyclohexanedione that, after conversion into enol ether 3, was condensed with diethyl oxalate to provide diketoester 4 that further reacted with methylhydrazine to form regioselectively the pyrazole 5. Condensation with N,N-dimethylformamide di-tert-butyl acetal gave rise to enaminone 6a. The preparation of intermediate 6b was accomplished by using dimedone as starting material. The formation of enol ether 7 was followed by a reaction sequence encompassing reduction of the conjugated double bond, elimination, and epoxidation to give intermediate 8. Oxirane ring-opening by methanol led to enol ether 9, regioisomer of 7. Subsequent condensation with diethyl oxalate and reaction of resulting 1,3-diketone intermediate with methylhydrazine regioselectively gave rise to the pyrazole derivative 10. Condensation with N,N-dimethylformamide di-tert-butyl acetal afforded the enaminone 6b. The two enaminones 6a and 6b were condensed with phenylguanidine carbonate in DMF to afford the arylamino derivatives 11a and 11b (Scheme 2). Hydrolysis of carboxylic esters gave the corresponding acids, which were submitted to the coupling with amines to provide amides 1, 16-21, and 26.

Alternatively, the two enaminones 6a and 6b were condensed with guanidine hydrochloride in DMF to afford the fused pyrimidine derivatives 12a and 12b, which were converted into the corresponding iodo derivatives 13a and 13b. Hydrolysis of carboxylic esters gave the corresponding acids, which were submitted to the coupling with amines to provide amides 14a,15a and 14b,15b. Palladium catalyzed coupling with substituted anilines furnished the arylamino derivatives 22-25 and 27-41. Results and Discussion An initial set of amides 1 and 16-21 (Table 1) was synthesized in order to explore the phosphate region of the ATP binding site of the CDK2/cyclin A, which accommodates the carboxamide groups. The primary carboxamide 1 proved to be the most active compound. Analogously, secondary amides bearing small substituents such as methyl, cyclopropyl, and hydroxyethyl (16-18) displayed interesting enzymatic activity as CDK2/cyclin A inhibitors, whereas

bulkier residues such as cyclopentyl, phenyl, and benzyl (19-21) caused a marked decrease in activity on CDK2/ cyclin A. However, no particular improvement in terms of selectivity vs the serine-threonine kinase Aurora A (used as indicator of compound selectivity) and of cellular antiproliferative activity was achieved moving from the primary amide 1 to the most interesting secondary amides 16-18. Exploration of the solvent accessible region of the ATP binding site of CDK2/cyclin A was realized by introducing solubilizing moieties on the phenyl ring to give arylamines 22-25 (Table 2). Early comparison of analogues 22 and 23 with parent compounds 1 and 16, respectively, indicated that introduction of the 4-methylpiperazinyl moiety on the phenyl ring para position afforded potent enzyme inhibitors with an improvement of the antiproliferative activity in A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells as well as solubility in neutral buffer.

(24) or of the morpholin-4-yl group in the para position of the phenyl ring (25) was compatible with the maintenance of the CDK2 inhibitory activity and potency in the cellular antiproliferative assay, albeit solubility in neutral buffer was diminished. Unfortunately, improvement in the selectivity vs Aurora A, as well as vs many of the kinases in our panel, was not achieved with this series, and the exploration of the small CDK2 cavity at the back of the pocket (buried region) was considered. Size and shape of this cavity vary among the different kinases and are often exploited for improving selectivity. The buried region of CDK2, defined by Ala31, Val64, Phe80, and Ala144,13 is small mainly because of the presence of a hindered and rigid gatekeeper residue such as Phe80. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) data generated by us11,13,14 and others15 on multiple chemical classes have shown that occupation of this buried area by small hydrophobic moieties is beneficial to CDK2 binding. By visual inspection and modeling experiments, position 4 of the pyrazoloquinazoline skeleton was identified as suitable for placing a moiety such as a dimethyl group that could increase the hydrophobic

contact in the CDK2 buried region. Compound 26 (Table 3) showed interesting CDK2 inhibitory activity and potency in the A2780 cells assay. Moreover, incorporation of the dimethyl moiety at the 4-position resulted in a significant improvement of selectivity against Aurora A for compound 26 when compared to compound 1, supporting the working hypothesis. With the aim of improving solubility in neutral buffer, an expansion on the 4,4-dimethylsubstituted pyrazoloquinazoline skeleton was performed by keeping the 3-substituent fixed as primary or N-methylamide and varying the arylamines at position 8. Introduction of the 4-methylpiperazinyl moiety in the para position of the phenyl ring (27 and 28) provided compounds with good activity against CDK2/cyclin A and in A2780 cell proliferation assay as well as good solubility in neutral buffer. Selectivity toward Aurora A was reasonably improved by the presence of the 4,4-dimethyl moiety, in particular when comparing 28 with 23. As far as buffer solubility is concerned, compound 28, albeit less potent than compound 27, displayed higher solubility. The binding mode

of the 4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-h]quinazoline skeleton was confirmed by the crystal structure of compound 28 in complex with CDK2/cyclin A (Figure 3). Compound 28 is anchored, in a similar manner as compound 2, to the ATP pocket of CDK2/cyclin A by three hydrogen bonds to the protein backbone of the hinge region (Leu83) and to the conserved Lys33. Selectivity enhancement of compound 28 with respect to 23 could be explained by the more favorable hydrophobic interactions of the 4,4-dimethyl group with the CDK2 gatekeeper residue Phe80 (compared with the Aurora A gatekeeper Leu210) and by the presence of the smaller side chain of CDK2-Val64 (Aurora A-Leu194). CDK2/cyclin A inhibitory activity was retained by introduction of the 4-methylpiperazinyl group in the meta position, as in compound 29, but a lower potency in the cellular antiproliferative assay was observed with respect to compound 28. Introduction of the morpholin-4-yl group in the para and meta positions of the phenyl ring led to compounds 30 and 31, respectively, that were less potent on the enzyme and in the cellular antiproliferative assays and less soluble in neutral buffer than compound 28. The role of the 4-methylpiperazinyl moiety, as far as potency and solubility are concerned, was explored by replacement with different solubilizing groups attached to the phenyl ring in the para and meta positions (32-41). All these compounds, with the exception of 37 and 39, displayed good activity on CDK2/cyclin A and from moderate to good selectivity vs Aurora A. In particular, the para substituted compounds were endowed with a higher potency in the antiproliferative assay than the corresponding meta derivatives (compare 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 to 33, 35, 37, 39, 41). All compounds of this series showed good solubility except for the dimethylamino derivatives 38 and 39. Compounds 27, 28, 32, 34, 40 were selected for further assessment on the basis of their potency on the enzyme, antiproliferative activity, and preliminary solubility in neutral buffer. Further selection criteria were applied using preliminary in vitro physicochemical ADME properties (solubility in 5% dextrose, stability to human CYP4503A4, human plasma protein binding) and in vivo pharmacokinetic data as key parameters. As reported in Table 4, compound 28 emerged among these because of its high stability to human CYP4503A4 (85% remaining), acceptable

plasma protein binding (98% bound), and good solubility (10 mg/mL in 5% dextrose as hydrochloride salt). In addition, 28 possessed better pharmacokinetic parameters than the other compounds tested so far (32, 34, and 40 in Table 5). In vivo results in healthy nude mouse (10 mg/kg by iv administration) suggested a half-life of 2.6 h, with a moderate clearance (about 36% of the hepatic blood flow). The volume of distribution (Vss about 7-fold of the total body water) pointed toward a high tissue distribution. Compound 28, after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/kg, showed the highest oral bioavailability (85%) with an AUC of 8.29 M 3 h, a Cmax of 2.35 M, and a half-life of 2.9 h. Compound 28 displayed a combination of cellular potency and physicochemical properties that made it suitable for further profiling as an orally active CDK inhibitor. It was subsequently screened against a panel of 43 serine-threonine and tyrosine kinases. As shown in Table 6, among the members of the CDK family that were assessed, 28 turned out to be a potent inhibitor of CDK2/cyclin A but also, albeit less potent, an inhibitor of CDK4/cyclin D1 (ratio vs CDK2/ cyclin A of 3.5Â), CDK5/p35 (6Â), CDK2/cyclin E (8Â), CDK1/cyclin B (8.5Â), and CDK7/cyclin H (3Â). Among all the other enzymes in the panel, only TRKA was inhibited in the same nanomolar range by compound 28. It is worth noting that overexpression of TRKA correlates with an aggressive phenotype and poor clinical outcome in malignant solid tumors such as prostate,16 pancreatic,17 and breast cancer.18 The effects of compound 28 on the cell cycle progression and DNA synthesis (Table 7) were analyzed using flow cytometry analysis and BrdU incorporation, respectively, on A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells in exponential growth in the

presence or absence of compound, for 24 h at 1 M. At this concentration, the compound was able to show a clear reduction of S phase population, which was associated with an increase of G1 population as expected for a CDK2/ cyclin A inhibitor. The reduction of S phase population was linked to a strong reduction of the percentage of BrdU incorporating cell, meaning that DNA synthesis in these cells was impaired. In addition, the effect on the phosphorylation status of a known CDK substrate such as retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was analyzed in cells treated with compound 28 at 1 and 3 M. A clear reduction of the hyperphosphorylated form of pRb and an accumulation of the hypophosphorylated form of pRb were observed in the extracts of treated cells in comparison with the untreated cells, indicative of an effect on the activity of CDK2 (Figure 4). On the basis of the data presented above, compound 28 was prioritized for further in vivo characterization in the human ovarian A2780 xenograft mouse model. The doses of 20, 30, and 40 mg/kg were selected and administered orally twice a day for 10 consecutive days on the basis of the plasma levels reached in the preliminary in vivo PK study. Figure 5 illustrates the results from this study. Compound 28 caused a dosedependent inhibition of A2780 tumor growth up to 91% at a dose of 40 mg/kg.

Conclusions Starting from compound 1, showing good potency as CDK inhibitor but being poorly selective against a panel of serinethreonine and tyrosine kinases, a series of new analogues was synthesized. A remarkable enhancement in selectivity toward Aurora A was achieved through the incorporation of the dimethyl group at the 4-position of the skeleton. Several of the prepared compounds showed antiproliferative activity against A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells mediated by CDK2 inhibition. Optimization of the physical properties and pharmacokinetic profile led to the identification of the highly potent, orally available compound 28 (PHA-848125). The inhibition of TRKA highlighted the value of 28 due to the involvement of this kinase in the development of solid tumors such as prostate, pancreatic, and breast cancer. The evaluation of this aspect will be reported elsewhere. Compound 28 is currently undergoing phase I and phase II clinical trials. Experimental Section

determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC-UV-MS analyses, used to assess compound purity, were carried out combining the ion trap MS instrument with HPLC system SSP4000 (Thermo Separation Products) equipped with an autosampler LC Pal (CTC Analytics) and UV6000LP diode array detector (UV detection at 215-400 nm). Instrument control, data acquisition, and processing were performed by using Xcalibur 1.2 software (Finnigan). HPLC chromatography was run at room temperature and 1 mL/min flow rate using a Waters X Terra RP 18 column (4.6mmÂ50 mm, 3.5 m). Mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5 with acetic acid)/acetonitrile, 90:10, and mobile phase B was 5 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 5.5 with acetic acid)/ acetonitrile, 10:90. The gradient was from 0 to 100% B in 7 min and then held at 100% B for 2 min before requilibration.

Crystallographic Methods. Expression, purification, crystallization, and soaking procedures of the CDK2/cyclin A complexes were carried out as previously described.21 Kinase Assays. Kinase assays were performed as previously described.21 The panel includes c-ABL, AKT1, ALK, Aur-A, Aur-B, CDC7, CDK2/A, CDK1/B, CDK2/E, CDK4/D1, CDK5/p25, CDK7/H, CHK1, CK2, EGFR, ERK2, FGFR1, GSK3, IGF1R, IKKi, IKK2, IR, C-KIT, LCK, LYN, MAPKAPK2, MET, NEK-6, NIM, PAK4, PDGFR, PDK1, PKAR, PKC, PLK1, P38R, P38, RET, STLK2, SULU1, TRKA, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, and ZAP-70. In Vitro Pharmacology. A2780 Cells Proliferation Assay. Cells were seeded into 96- or 384-well plates at final concentration ranging from 10 000 to 30 000 cells per cm2 in appropriate medium plus 10% FCS. After 24 h cells were treated using serial dilution of compounds in two replicates. At 72 h after treatment the amount of cells were evaluated using the Cell Titer_Glo assay (Promega). IC50 values were calculated using a sigmoidal fitting (Assay Explorer MDL). Experiments were replicated at least two times. Flow Cytometry Analysis and BrdU Incorporation. A2780 cells (human adenocarcinoma ovary, from ECACC) were seeded in T-75 tissue culture flasks, 25 000 cells/cm2 in RPMI 1640, pH 7.4, 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1Â penicillin-streptomycin, and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C with 96% relative humidity. After 24 h, cells were treated with compounds at 1 M for 24 h. Cells in the supernatant and adherent cells were collected using 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. Cells were washed with PBS and were divided into three samples for flow cytometry analysis and for immunoblot and BrdU incorporation, as previously described.21 In Vivo Pharmacology. Evaluation of antitumor efficacy was performed as previously described.21 High-Throughput Solubility. Solubility at pH 7 was performed as previously described.21 Metabolic Stability. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 10 M. Human cDNA expressed cytochrome P450 isoforms (supersomes) were purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA). All chemicals used were of analytical grade and commercially available. The potential inhibitory effect was investigated against cDNA expressed human CYP4503A4 supersome using typical substrates incubated at their respective

Km concentration. The known inhibitor ketoconazole was included to check the inhibition response. Analysis of both substrate and metabolite was done by LC/MS/MS. Plasma Protein Binding. Plasma protein binding was performed as previously described.21 In Vivo Pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the compounds were investigated in overnight fasted male Nu/ Nu mice following a single dose given intravenously (iv) or orally (po). The vehicle used was 5% dextrose solution. A total of six mice were treated (three for each leg). Blood samples of each mouse were collected from the saphenous vein at predose, 0.083, 0.5, 1, 6, and 24 h postdosing following iv dosing, and at predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 6, and 24 h following oral dosing. Samples were centrifuged at 10000g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the plasma was stored at -80 °C until analysis. Samples were analyzed by LC/ MS/MS technique.
