Abstract

Insulin has a concentration of 10-8-10 -11M in the blood which ensures that it circulates and exerts its physiological functions in vivo as a monomer. The crystal structure of monomeric porcine desB1-B2 despentapeptide (B26-B30) insulin (DesB1-2 DPI) with M r = 4934 Da has been determined at 1.65 A resolution using the molecular replacement method. A structural comparison between DesB1-2 DPI and 2Zn insulin reveals that the conformation of DesB1-2 DPI is more similar to molecule I than molecule II of 2Zn insulin. The remarkable conformational difference between B25-Phe in DesB1-2 DPI and B25-Phe in despentapeptide (B26-B30) insulin (DPI) indicates that the residue B25-Phe possesses great flexibility and mobility.

1. Introduction

Insulin, which is the principal hormone controlling blood glucose level, acts by stimulating glucose influx and metabolism in muscles and adipocytes and inhibiting gluconeogenesis by the liver. In addition insulin modifies the expression or activity of a variety of enzymes and transport systems in nearly every kind of cell. Insulin activity is mediated through insulin receptors, transmembrane glycoproteins with intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. The insulin receptor has a molecular mass of 300000 and includes two ol- and two fl-chains organized in a way similar to immunoglobin molecules. Insulin binds to the receptor u-chain to initiate the phosphorylation of fl-subunit tyrosine residues which then influence enzymes involved in phosphorylation and desphosphorylation in the cell which may, in turn, activate the processes of glycolysis, lipogenesis and protein synthesis (Kasuga et al., 1982; Van Obberghen, Rossi, Kowalski, Gazzano & Ponzio, 1983). Sequence comparison has shown that A l-A4 (Gly-IleVal-Glu or Asp) and B23-B26 (Gly-Phe-Phe-Tyr) exhibit extended interspecies homology and they are preserved in almost all insulin species (Blundell & Wood, 1975). In fact, amino-acid substitutions within these regions have been identified in the insulins from

three individuals in whom genetic mutations resulted in the secretion of abnormal hormones associated with diabetes (Tager et al., 1979, 1980; Shoelson, Haneda et al., 1983; Shoelson, Fickova et al., 1983; Haneda, Chan, Kowk, Rubenstein & Steiner, 1983), insulin Chicago (B25-Phe--~B25-Leu), insulin Los Angeles (B24-Phe--->B24-Ser), and insulin Wakayama (A3Val--->A3-Leu). The structural analysis of a A1-B29 cross-linked insulin, which was completely inactive, indicates that its conformation is nearly same as that of native insulin (Derewenda et al., 1991). The lower binding potency of the cross-linked insulin results from the restraining effect of the cross-link that impedes the conformational changes necessary for generation of the binding conformation. In the possible binding-interaction mechanism for insulin with its receptor, when the monomeric insulin molecule comes close to its receptor molecule, the C-terminal segment of the B chain moves away from its original position through the hinge peptide at B24 and thus exposes the hydrophobic surface for recognition and binding with a corresponding hydrophobic surface on the receptor. B25-Phe, which has a strong conformational mobility, may orient itself for the recognition and interaction of the n'-bonds between aromatic rings when the insulin molecule comes close to and binds with the receptor (Liang, Chang, Zhang & Wan, 1992; Liang, Chang, Wang & Zhang, 1992; Wang & Liang, 1985; Liang, Chang & Wan, 1994). Additional studies on the insulin analogues of the B-chain N-terminus reveal that the removal of the N-terminal B1-Phe does not lead to any change in the biological activity but greatly reduces the immunoactivity (Brandenburg, 1969). Investigations of insulin analogues with amino acids removed from the B-chain N-terminus (Schwartz & Katsoyannis, 1978; Chu, Chu & Chang, 1984; Lei, Dong, Xie & Yuan, 1983), have indicated that the immunoactivity and biological activity both decrease when the peptide chain is shortened. Several three-dimensional structures of insulins from different species, chemically modified insulin derivatives, and mutant insulins have been described, including some high-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses (Adams et al., 1969; Cutfield et al., 1981; Chang et al., 1986). These studies have produced a wealth of data

PORCINE DESB1-B2 DESPENTAPEPTIDE (B26-B30) INSULIN subjected to Patterson correlation (PC) refinement treating the entire DesB1-2 DPI as a rigid body. PC refinement produced a maximum peak that corresponded to the highest solution from the crossrotation function search. The correlation coefficient of this solution was 0.34. The next highest peak had a correlation coefficient of only 0.13. The model was then rotated by the angles (248.7, 15.0, 288.7 ° ) corresponding to the best rotation solution. The X-PLOR translation function was used for the translation search. The translation solution X = 0.038, Y -- 0.000, Z = 0.192 (fractional coordinates) always appeared at the first position. Using data from 8 to 4 A , the translation 50 45 40 7< -~ 30 ~ 25 ~ 20 15 l0

leading to various models describing the interaction of insulin with its receptor. DesB1-2 DPI which retains 10.8% receptor-binding activity of insulin but a very low immunoactivity (2.4%) (Chu et al., 1984; Chu, 1987) is one kind of insulin derivative having a modified B-chain N-terminus and C-terminus that exists in monomeric form. The structure of DesB1-2 DPI will be used for comparison with the structures of 2Zn insulin, DPI and other insulin derivatives to further analyze the insulin structure-function relationship.

2. Experimental
2.1. Crystal and data
DesB1-2 DPI was crystallized as described by Wan, Diao, Chang & Liang (1994). The best crystals were obtained from a 5mgm1-1 protein solution in 0 . 0 5 M citrate buffer (pH 8.4) containing 0.025% zinc chloride and 10% acetone. Crystals of DesB1-2 DPI belong to space group P21, with cell dimensions a = 2 6 . 9 , b = 24.5, c - 28.1 ,&, /5 = 103.8 ~. There is one molecule in each crystallographic asymmetric unit according to the crystal densities of insulin analogues. The unitcell dimensions correspond to a specific volume Vm of 1.82A,3Da -1, implying a solvent content of 32% (Matthews, 1968). Reflection data for DesB1-2 DPI crystals were measured at room temperature on a Siemens X-200B area detector using graphite-monochromated C u K a radiation generated by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode operating at 200 kV and 50 mA. The crystal-todetector distance was fixed at 8 cm. Two data sets were collected at 20 angles of 0 and 25 ° to obtain as many reflections as possible. The two data sets were merged using the XENGEN package (Howard, Gilliland, Finzel & Poulos, 1987) with Rsy m equal to 2.72%. There were 3829 unique reflections, 3739 of these were greater than 5o and 3789 were greater than 20. The completeness of the total data set for DesB1-2 DPI in the range of 27.31.65 A was 87.1%. 2.2. Structural determination and refinement The cross-rotation function from X-PLOR (Brfinger, 1992) was used for the cross-rotation search. The 1.5 A DPI crystal structure model (Dai, Lou, You & Liang, 1987) with the residues B1 and B2 cut off was used as the search model. Patterson maps of the model were calculated by placing the probe model into a cubic box with cell edges 60 A long for the structure calculation. The first peak of the rotation function always appeared at Eulerian angles (248.7, 15.0, 288.7°). The rotation search values showed apparent discrimination; using an integration radius of 20 A and the data between 7 and 3 A resolution, the highest value from the rotation search was 8.7a. The second highest was 6.3a. The 100 highest peaks from the cross-rotation search were

JIA-SHENG DIAO, ZHU-LI WAN, WEN-RUI CHANG AND DONG-CAI LIANG function gave the largest signal-to-noise ratio, 1.47, and the lowest R factor, 40.9%. The rotation function and the translation function gave the orientation angles (248.7, 15.0, 288.7 °) and the position (0.038, 0.000, 0.192) of the DesB1-2 DPI molecule in the unit cell. Rigid-body. refinement, using all the data between 8 and 3A resolution, reduced the R factor to 40.6%. The rigid-body refined DesB1-2 DPI model was the starting point for the restrained least-squares refinement using GPRLSA (Furey, Wang & Sax, 1982). The refinement started at low resolution with a small number of reflections and used tight stereochemical restraints to avoid destroying the original model. Seven rounds of refinement were executed using data in the range 10-3,~,. The structure was then refined with higher 2.5 ,~ resolution data. After each round of refinement, the model was adjusted on a graphics workstation using omit maps and 2Fo - F c maps. The individual thermal-factor refinement was initiated during the positional refinement at 2.2,~ which reduces the R factor to 25.4%. The resolution was then continually extended to 2, 1.8 and 1.65 ,~, with adjustments to the model at each round which further reduces the R factor to 22.8%. The resolution was extended to 101.65 ,~, to include 10-5 ,~ data closely concerned with solvent reflections. 33 water molecules with full occupancy were added into the final structure. At the end of the crystallographic refinement, the R factor calculated on the basis of 378 non-H atoms of protein and solvent molecules was 19.7%, for the 3774 reflections in the 10-1.65,~ resolution range (86.3% completeness in the shell). The r.m.s. deviations from ideality were 0.017,~, for bond lengths, 1.9 ° for bond angles and 0.021 ,~ for planar groups.

which lie antiparallel to each other. Residues A10-A12 constitute a loop region and residues A20-A21 form an extended peptide. The first five residues of the B chain, B3-B7 have an extended conformation. At residue B8, the chain takes a sharp turn and residues B9-B19 form an u-helix. Residues B20 and B23 are in a U-shaped configuration but the remaining residues B24-B25 form part of an extended chain. The electron density for the DesB 1-2 DPI molecule is very well defined (Fig. 2) while the density for the side chain of residue B3-Asn is somewhat weak. A total of 33 well defined water molecules form a network of hydrogen bonds, with 25 of them directly hydrogen bonded with the protein molecule. The average temperature factor of the solvent molecules is roughly comparable to that of the other atoms in the structure. This substantial order of water molecules in the structure may arise from the relatively low solvent content of the DesB 1-2 DPI crystals (32 %), so that most of the 33 solvent molecules are located within the first or second contact shell of the protein molecule. 3.2. Comparison with 2Zn insulin Molecule I of the dimer of 2Zn insulin is very similar in conformation to the corresponding molecule I of the dimer of the 4Zn form. The 2Zn insulin coordinates were derived from the structure refined at 1.2A resolution with an R factor of 12.8% (Chang et al., 1986). The superposition is based on 44 residues common to DesB1-2 DPI and to molecule I or molecule II of 2Zn insulin. The r.m.s, deviations of DesBl-1 DPI from molecule I and molecule II for the superimposed atoms of all residues were 1.46 and 1.96 A, respectively. The corresponding deviations for main-chain atoms were 0.64 and 1.06,~. As previously noted (Stuart et al., 1984), these results confirm that the insulin molecule I represents a more typical insulin structure, which is also in accord with studies of 4Zn and hagfish insulins (Cutfield et al., 1981). The detailed information was obtained from the comparison by dividing the DesB 1-2 DPI molecule into the A chain, the B chain, and several individual segments of A 1-A9, A 13-A 18, B3-B8, B9B19 and B20-B25 (Table 1). The r.m.s, deviations of the 2Zn insulin molecule I from DesB1-2 DPI for all atoms of the A chain, the B chain, and individual segments were almost all less than the r.m.s, deviations from comparisons of DesB1-2 DPI with molecule II of 2Zn insulin, giving further evidence of the similarities between molecule I of 2Zn insulin and DesB1-2 DPI. Structural comparison of either the entire molecule, the A chain, the B chain, or the individual segments of monomeric DesB1-2 DPI with corresponding parts of the 2Zn insulin molecule reveal that the conformation of molecule I in the dimer of 2Zn insulin is quite close to the structure of the monomeric DesB1-2 DPI molecule,

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Structural description The DesB1-2 DPI monomer contains two chains, A and B, containing 21 and 23 residues, respectively, linked by disulfide bridges, A7-B7 and A20-B19. A third disulfide bridge lies within the A chain at A6-A 11. The A chain contains two helices, A1-A9 and A13-A19

PORCINE DESB1-B2 DESPENTAPEPTIDE (B26-B30) INSULIN results showed that the A-chain conformations of the two monomers are more closely related than those of the B chain. Further structural comparison was based on the individual segments of DesB1-2 DPI and the equivalent segments of DPI. The main-chain r.m.s. deviations of individual segments A1-A9 (0.18 ,~), A10-A12 (0.14,~) and A13-A18 (0.25,~) were all less than that of the A chain as a whole (0.38,~), which implies that despite the similar folding topology, the individual segments of the A chain have moved relative to one other. The main-chain atoms of B3-B8 and B9B19 of DesB1-2 DPI and DPI fit with r.m.s, deviations of 0.17 and 0.32/~, whereas the C-termini of the B chain have quite different conformations with r.m.s. deviations of 1.42/~ for residues B20-B25. B25-Phe in the DesB1-2 DPI molecule had moved a significantly amount from its position in the DPI molecule (Fig. 3). The mobility of B25 in a despentapeptide insulin is perhaps affected by its being the C-terminal residue. It is apparent in Fig. l(a) where the residue B25 and as well as N-terminal residues B3 and B4 have high B factors. In summary, the general foldings of DesB1-2 DPI and DPI are very similar. The most stable parts of the two monomers are the three helices A1-A9, A13-A18 and B9-B19, which have almost identical conformations in the two structures with some relative movement around certain peptide bonds. The great variation occurs in the region of residues B20-B25, in which the B25-Phe residue is markedly different. Studies of the model proposed to describe the interaction between the insulin molecule with its receptor (Liang et al., 1994) showed that the hydrophobic residues on the amphipathic binding surface consisted mainly of A2-Ile, A3-Val, A19-Tyr, B11-Leu,

implying that the conformation of molecule I is more similar to the monomeric molecule of DesB 1-2 DPI than that of molecule II in 2Zn insulin.

3.3. Comparison with DPI
The crystal structure of a monomeric porcine despentapeptide (B26-B30) insulin (DPI) was first determined at 2.4A resolution (Liang et° al., 1983; Stuart et al., 1984) and then refined at 1.5 A resolution with an R factor of 14.4% (Dai et al., 1987). DPI was found to have only one molecule in the asymmetric unit. A beef DPI structure containing two molecules in the asymmetric unit was also reported at high resolution (Bi et al., 1984). The structural comparison of the modified insulin monomers of DesB1-2 DPI and porcine DPI at high resolution gives some insight into the structural features of the free insulin monomer. Considering the main-chain atoms of the A chain and the B chain, the optimal superposition produced r.m.s. deviations of 0.38 and 1.07A, respectively. These

Residue B25-Phe was one of the crucial residues having a bulky aromatic ring on the hydrophobic surface. In porcine DPI crystals, the orientation of residue B25-Phe was opposite to that of the 2Zn porcine insulin and the main chain had been turned (Liang et al., 1992), indicating that the conformation of residue B25-Phe was very flexible. The position of residue B25-Phe in the DesB1-2 DPI structure has been determined precisely (Fig. 4). Superposition of the main chains of DesB1-2 DPI and DPI (Fig. 3) shows that the conformation of residue

B25-Phe in the B-chain C-terminus is significantly different in the two molecules providing further evidence that the conformation of residue B25-Phe is very flexible. This conformational flexibility may guarantee the conformational changes of the B-chain C-terminus, which is essential for insulin recognition with its receptor (Wang & Liang, 1985).
