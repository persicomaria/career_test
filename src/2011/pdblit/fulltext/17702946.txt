gle and double substitutions were created in each of these secondary structures, and the ability of FhaC variants to interact with FHA was assessed (fig. S6) by using an overlay assay developed previously (25). Modifications in H2 affected FHA recognition by FhaC in this overlay assay, indicating that helix H2 forms part of the specific recognition surface of FHA. Collectively, previous data (15) and our new mutagenesis data indicate that the L6 loop­motif 3 and the POTRA domains, which are the hallmark features of the superfamily, constitute the active secretion elements of FhaC. FHA is a 50-nm elongated right-handed parallel b helix (26­28), with the adherence determinants presented on loops or extrahelical motifs along the b helix. The helix interior is essentially filled with stacks of aliphatic residues (Val, Leu, Ile, Ala, and Gly), a characteristic often observed in such b helices. In the light of our structural and functional analysis of FhaC, we propose the following model for transport of FHA across the outer membrane (Fig. 4). The N-terminal TPS domain of FHA, which is characteristic of TpsA proteins and harbors specific secretion signals, initially interacts in an extended conformation with the POTRA 1 domain in the periplasm. Given the orientation of the POTRA domains relative to the channel, the FHA-FhaC interactions bring the region corresponding to the first repeats of the central b-helical domain of FHA in proximity to the tip of loop L6. Conformational changes in FhaC would then expel loop L6 out of the b barrel, opening a 8 Å to 16 Å large (depending on whether H1 is inside or outside the channel during secretion) channel for FHA translocation (fig. S4, C and D). In either case, the channel would not be wide enough to support internal folding of the repeated b-helical motifs of FHA; thus, this event likely takes place at the cell surface. FHA may form a hairpin made up of two extended polypeptide chains in the channel, with its TPS domain anchored in the periplasm. The first repeats of the adhesin could then reach the cell surface, where they could progressively fold into b-helical coils. The formation of the FHA rigid b helix may provide the energy to drive its translocation through FhaC. Transport of FHA in this direction is in agreement with the observation that the C terminus of FHA is exposed to the cell surface before its N terminus (29). After the C terminus of FHA has reached the surface, the TPS domain could dissociate from the POTRA domains and be translocated, capping the N terminus of the FHA b helix. Lastly, loop L6 could move back into the barrel. Because most TpsA proteins are predicted to fold into b helical structures (26, 27), the transport mechanism proposed here may apply more generally to the secretion of TpsA proteins by their dedicated TpsB transporters. All members of the Omp85-TpsB superfamily harbor one to several POTRA domains followed by a b barrel, as well as conserved motifs corresponding to the L6 loop within the barrel, and they mostly handle substrate proteins rich in b structure. Therefore, the major features described here are likely to remain valid throughout the family, although more complex molecular events are expected for some of those transporters, given that they are part of macromolecular assemblies.

Harrison,3,4 Daniel Kahne1,3* Integral b-barrel proteins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Gramnegative bacteria. The machine that assembles these proteins contains an integral membrane protein, called YaeT in Escherichia coli, which has one or more polypeptide transport­associated (POTRA) domains. The crystal structure of a periplasmic fragment of YaeT reveals the POTRA domain fold and suggests a model for how POTRA domains can bind different peptide sequences, as required for a machine that handles numerous b-barrel protein precursors. Analysis of POTRA domain deletions shows which are essential and provides a view of the spatial organization of this assembly machine.

machine (5, 6). Genetic and biochemical experiments have identified many parts of this machine in several organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli (3­13). The only conserved component in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is an integral b-barrel membrane protein, represented by YaeT in E. coli, Sam50 in mitochondria, and a Toc75 isoform in chloroplasts. A substantial region of all three proteins projects into the intermembrane space and contains one or more predicted polypeptide transport­ associated (POTRA) domains (3, 4, 14). Proteins destined for the outer membrane of E. coli are synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported across the inner membrane through the SecYEG protein secretion machinery (Fig. 1) (15). The signal sequence targeting them for secretion is removed at the outer face of the inner membrane. The processed OMP then traverses the periplasmic compartment to b-barrel assembly sites in the outer membrane. Chaperones may assist in periplasmic passage (16). It is presumed that the processed OMPs contain structural features that allow them to be recognized by the b-barrel assembly machinery, which in E. coli consists of at least five interacting components: four lipoproteins (YfgL, YfiO, NlpB, and SmpA) and the conserved integral membrane protein, YaeT (5, 13). There are homologs of YaeT in organisms from bacteria to humans (17). Recent experiments with E. coli YaeT and S. cerevisiae Sam50 have shown that these proteins are essential for viability. Furthermore, levels of folded bbarrel proteins decrease and levels of misfolded b-barrel proteins increase when they are depleted (4, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19). YaeT was reported to bind C-terminal peptides of OMPs (20). The POTRA domain in Sam50 was shown to bind

unfolded b-barrel precursors, suggesting that this POTRA domain plays an important role in assembling other b-barrel proteins in the mitochondrial membrane (21). Biochemical studies of truncated variants of Toc75 have also implicated its POTRA domains as docking sites for proteins destined to be targeted to, or across, biological membranes (22). No structure of a POTRA domain has yet been reported. We expressed and purified the periplasmic domain of E. coli YaeT containing all five

POTRA domains (YaeT21-420) (23, 24). Crystallization of this construct was unsuccessful, but a shorter fragment containing four POTRA domains (residues 21 to 351) yielded well-ordered crystals with diffraction to spacings of 2.2 Å (23, 24). The overall structure of YaeT21-351 has a fishhook-like shape, with successive POTRA domains rotated in a right-handed direction (Fig. 2, A and B). Despite having low sequence similarity, the POTRA domains have similar

folds, comprising a three-stranded b sheet overlaid with a pair of antiparallel helices (Fig. 2C). The order of secondary-structure elements is b-a-a-b-b (disproving a previous prediction) (14); the first and second b strands form the two edges of the sheet, with the b3 strand sandwiched between them. The conserved residues that define the POTRA domains are primarily in the hydrophobic core or loop regions, suggesting that they are important for the structural integrity of POTRA domain (Fig. 2, C and D). YaeT21-351 is a dimer in the crystal (Fig. 2E). The two monomers are intertwined, burying 1900 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface of each monomer. The longest contiguous set of contacts between monomer units involves a series of main-chain hydrogen bonds between the b2 edge of the P3 domain of one monomer (Asp241 to Leu247) and the first residues (Asn345 to Lys351) of the truncated P5 domain of the other monomer (Fig. 2F). These residues form a parallel b strand with respect to the b2 edge of the P3 domain and bury ~1000 Å2, more than half the total buried surface. There are no other extensive contacts between monomers, suggesting that dimerization is mediated by this parallel b-stranded interface. Formation of this interface may have been necessary for growth of wellordered crystals given that slightly shorter (YaeT21-348) or longer (YaeT21-355) constructs failed to crystallize. Nonetheless, highly ordered contacts are conserved at the interfaces between successive POTRA domains (fig. S1), suggesting that the fishhook conformation is present in the monomer. We do not think that the dimer is physiologically relevant for several reasons. First, YaeT21-351 elutes as a monomer from a size exclusion column (fig. S2), implying that the stability of the dimer observed in the crystal is weak. Second, the N terminus of P5, which forms one of the b strands of the dimer interface, would not be available to interact with P3 in the fulllength protein because the interacting residues Fig. 4.

Strains expressing DP1 and DP2 grow better and have higher levels of OMPs than DP3, DP4, and the vector-only control. Although levels of DP1 cannot be quantified, DP2 is stable, indicating insertion into the membrane even in the absence of wild-type YaeT. Nevertheless, all strains lacking wild-type YaeT exhibit a strong extracytoplasmic stress response (increased DegP) indicative of OMP-assembly defects.

would be buried in the P5 hydrophobic core. Nevertheless, the dimer interface shows that one way in which other polypeptides can interact with POTRA domains is by b augmentation (25). The lipoproteins in the OMP assembly complex reside in the periplasmic space along with the five POTRA domains of YaeT. One function of the POTRA domains in YaeT could be to provide a scaffold to organize these lipoproteins. Using the crystal structure as a guide, we prepared five N-terminally His-tagged YaeT deletion constructs, each lacking a POTRA domain. All five deletion constructs (YaeTDP1 to YaeTDP5) could be expressed in an E. coli strain containing a wild-type chromosomal yaeT gene; all were targeted to the outer membrane and folded as judged by heat modifiability (Fig. 3A). Each deletion construct was purified by Ni-affinity chromatography, and eluents were assayed to determine which lipoproteins were present. Any of the first four POTRA domains can be deleted without disrupting the interactions with YfiO, NlpB or SmpA; however, the P5 deletion loses all three of these lipoproteins (Fig. 3B). YfgL disappears when any POTRA domains except P1 are deleted (Fig. 3B). These studies show that the periplasmic portion of YaeT scaffolds the other four proteins; and the studies also outline the spatial organization of the OMP assembly complex. Although YaeT purified from inclusion bodies is reported to form higher-order oligomers (20), the multiprotein OMP assembly complex behaves as a monomer. It has a mobility on Blue-Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) corresponding to a mass less than 230 kD (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, wild-type YaeT does not associate with the His-tagged YaeT POTRA domain deletion mutants (Fig. 3D). To assess the functional importance of each POTRA domain, we constructed five POTRA domain deletion mutants without His tags for complementation studies in an E. coli YaeTdepletion strain. The DP1 and DP2 mutant proteins retained partial function: Strains expressing these proteins can survive YaeT depletion but grow poorly (Fig. 4). Strains producing the DP3 and DP4 mutant proteins did not survive YaeT depletion (Fig. 4), showing that P3 and P4 are essential for viability even though neither scaffolds an essential lipoprotein. The DP5 construct could not be introduced into the YaeT-depletion strain even under conditions where wild-type YaeT was expressed. Apparently, the DP5 mutant protein is toxic to cells in this context. Because we cannot detect an interaction between the mutant protein and wild-type YaeT or any of the lipoproteins, we suggest that DP5 mishandles nascent b-barrel substrates, producing harmful misfolded or aggregated OMPs. P3 has a feature not present in the others--a b bulge (Ile240 and Asp241) in strand b2. This strand is at the edge that binds the vestigial residues of P5, and the bulge appears to expose the strand for b augmentation. To determine whether this feature of P3 is involved in an essential function of YaeT or in its association with YfgL, we moved Asp241 two and four residues along the b strand to alter the likely location of the bulge and to reduce or disrupt the potential for b augmentation. These bulge translation mutants were expressed at wild-type levels. The two- and four-residue shifts decreased and abolished, respectively, binding to YfgL (Fig. 3E), but both mutants complemented the YaeT deletion strain. These results show that the edge of P3 participates in binding YfgL but that the essential functions of P3 do not involve the modified edge of the domain, nor do they require its interactions with YfgL, as expected from the nonessential nature of this lipoprotein. The crystal structure may also hold clues to other functionally important regions of P3. The only residues in the polypeptide chain that are not resolved in the crystal structure are located within the loop between the a1 and a2 helices of P3. We have previously isolated a mutant that encodes a YaeT variant, YaeT6, which contains a two­amino acid insertion in the same region of the a1-a2 loop (12) of P3. YaeT6, which retains the ability to bind YfgL (Fig. 3E) as well as the other three proteins of the OMP assembly complex, compromises OMP assembly in a wildtype background, but suppresses the outer membrane permeability defects conferred by imp4213, a mutant allele of an essential gene that encodes an OMP that is required for lipopolysaccharide assembly (26). The a1-a2 loop of P3 may interact with Imp, providing an explanation for why mutations that alter the loop suppress the permeability defects caused by imp4213. Notably, b-strand augmentation (25), observed in the dimer interface of the YaeT crystal structure, occurs in other complexes that bind unfolded OMPs--for example, the PDZ domain of DegS, which helps clear misfolded OMPs from the periplasm (27). We have shown that P3 may bind YfgL in this way, and it is possible that other POTRA domains, which also contain exposed edges, interact with polypeptides by b-strand augmentation. This mode of capture would allow POTRA domains to participate in assembling the b barrels of OMPs in a manner that is insensitive to the diversity of their primary sequences but dependent on their common hydrophobic periodicity.
