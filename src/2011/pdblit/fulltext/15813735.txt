The mutation G145S in PrfA, a key virulence regulator of Listeria monocytogenes, increases DNA-binding affinity by stabilizing the HTH motif

Marina Eiting, Gregor Hagelüken, Wolf-Dieter Schubert and Dirk W. Heinz* Division of Structural Biology, German Research Centre for Biotechnology (GBF), Mascheroder Weg 1, D-38124 Braunschweig, Germany. Summary Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive, facultative intracellular human pathogen, causes systemic infections with high mortality rate. The majority of the known pathogenicity factors of L. monocytogenes is regulated by a single transcription factor, PrfA. Hyperhaemolytic laboratory strains of L. monocytogenes express the constitutively active mutant PrfAG145S inducing virulence gene overexpression independent of environmental conditions. PrfA belongs to the Crp/ Fnr family of transcription factors generally activated by a small effector, such as cAMP or O2. We present the crystal structures of wild-type PrfA, the first Gram-positive member of the Crp/Fnr family, and of the constitutively active mutant PrfAG145S. Cap (Crp) has previously been described exclusively in the cAMP-induced (DNA-free and -bound) conformation. By contrast, the PrfA structures present views both of the non-induced state and of the mutationally activated form. The low DNA-binding affinity of wild-type PrfA is supported both structurally (partly disordered helix­turn­helix motif, overall geometry of the HTH ahelices deviates from Cap) and by surface plasmon resonance analyses (KD = 0.9 mM). In PrfAG145S the HTH motifs dramatically rearrange to adopt a conformation comparable to cAMP-induced Cap and hence favourable for DNA binding, supported by a DNA-binding affinity of 50 nM. Finally, the hypothesis that wild-type PrfA, like other Crp/Fnr family members, may require an as yet unidentified cofactor for activation is supported by the presence of a distinct tunnel in PrfA, located at the interface of the b-barrel and the DNAbinding domain.

Introduction Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive, facultative intracellular human pathogen that causes listeriosis, a severe systemic infection leading to septicaemia, meningoencephalitis or miscarriage, primarily in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women (Schlech, 2000). Listeria monocytogenes expresses a range of virulence factors intimately involved in the process of infection. Many of these virulence factors have been characterized in detail over recent years (Cossart, 2002). A sizeable subset of virulence factor genes is located on the listerial pathogenicity island 1 [LIPI-1 (Vazquez-Boland et al., 2001a,b; Kreft et al., 2002)]. They include hly (encoding listeriolysin O), plcA and plcB (two phospholipases C), mpl (a metalloprotease) and actA (ActA protein). Listeriolysin O and the phospholipases facilitate bacterial escape from the phagosome following uptake; ActA locally remodels the actin-cytoskeleton resulting in intracellular bacterial motility and cell-to-cell spread. Most virulence factors identified in L. monocytogenes, both within LIPI-1 and without, as well as numerous additional genes (Milohanic et al., 2003) are under transcriptional control of PrfA (positive regulatory factor A), itself encoded within LIPI-1. Mutants deficient in PrfA expression are, correspondingly, avirulent (Chakraborty et al., 1992).The primary structure of PrfA, a 27 kDa protein, identifies it as a member of the Crp/Fnr family of bacterial transcription factors (Lampidis et al., 1994; Vega et al., 1998; Körner et al., 2003). Each of these proteins (except possibly PrfA) is activated by a particular chemical entity. Crystal structures are available for two proteins from Gram-negative bacteria: cAMP receptor protein (Crp; also known as catabolite activator protein, Cap) (Weber and Steitz, 1987), the first representative of this family to be identified, and CooA (Lanzilotta et al., 2000), a CO-sensing transcription factor of Rhodospirillum rubrum. The majority of Crp/Fnr proteins is found in Gram-negative bacteria. PrfA is the best studied Gram-positive member of this protein family. It positively regulates virulence gene expression by binding to a 14 bp palindromic DNA sequence, the `PrfA-box'. Perfect palindromes recruit PrfA

434 M. Eiting, G. Hagelüken, W.-D. Schubert and D. W. Heinz more strongly than asymmetric promoters hence allowing for differentially regulated gene expression (Vega et al., 2004). Virulence gene expression is, however, also regulated by environmental factors such as temperature, pH and growth-medium composition (Behari and Youngman, 1998; Johansson et al., 2002). The synthesis and activity of PrfA itself is tightly controlled by several mechanisms: (i) Two promoters immediately upstream of the prfA gene lead to monocistronic mRNA whereas the promoter of plcA results in a bicistronic PlcA/PrfA mRNA (Freitag and Portnoy, 1994; Renzoni et al., 1999; Nadon et al., 2002), (ii) The untranslated mRNA (UTR) of prfA is thermoregulated, restricting PrfAexpression to elevated temperatures (Johansson et al., 2002) and (iii) Environmental conditions affect PrfA activity indicating that PrfA may require an as yet unidentified, low-molecular-weight activator (Milenbachs et al., 1997; Renzoni et al., 1997; Ermolaeva et al., 2004). Hyperhaemolytic laboratory strains of L. monocytogenes (e.g. NCTC7973, EGD-A) have been found to express a constitutively active mutant of PrfA (PrfAG145S) caused by the amino acid substitution Gly145ÆSer (Ripio et al., 1997a). PrfAG145S induces the overexpression of virulence genes even under environmental conditions (rich media and low temperatures) that normally lead to their downregulation (Ripio et al., 1997b; Behari and Youngman, 1998). Correspondingly, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that PrfAG145S has a significantly higher affinity for DNA than wild-type PrfA (Vega et al., 1998; 2004). We, hereby, present the crystal structures of the pleiotropic regulator PrfA of L. monocytogenes and its constitutively active mutant PrfAG145S ­ as well as quantitative binding affinities for the PrfA-box. A structural comparison of wild-type and mutant PrfA indicates that the point mutation induces structural changes throughout the protein culminating in the stabilization of the HTH motif, which as a result adopts an ordered conformation suited to DNA binding. Results Structure of PrfA Wild-type PrfA (PrfAwt, PDB-code 2BEO) crystallized in the space group P21 and contains a dimer per asymmetric unit. The PrfA monomers constituting a dimer are structurally very similar with an average r.m.s. deviation of 0.45 Å for equivalent Ca-atoms. Each PrfAwt monomer consists of an N-terminal domain (residues 1­108) and a C-terminal domain (residues 138­237) linked by a long a-helix (aC, residues 109­137) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal domain consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel b-barrel (b1­b8) of jelly roll topology, flanked by two a-helices (aA and aB). The C-terminal domain consists of six a-helices (aD­aI) and four antiparallel b-strands (b9­b12). Two ahelices, aE (residues 169­174) and aF (184­195), and the connecting loop, aE­aF (174­184), constitute the helix­turn­helix (HTH) motif observed in many prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins. No electron density is observed for loop aE­aF indicating that it is structurally flexible in PrfAwt. Corresponding residues can not be located and are not included in the final structure. The average temperature factor of the DNA-binding domain (22/79 Å2 ­ with/without TLS refinement) is noticeably

Crystal structure of PrfA 435 larger than that of the N-terminal domain (14/53 Å2), indicating a higher structural flexibility. Overall, the structure of PrfAwt is similar to that of Cap (see below). PrfA, however, bears three additional C-terminal a-helices (aG, aH and aI) not conserved in Cap. This region was postulated to form a C-terminal leucine zipper (Lampidis et al., 1994). This is, however, not confirmed. Instead, aG, aH and aI serve to stabilize the DNAbinding domain through intramolecular and intermolecular contacts. Hydrogen bonds from aH and aI to aC and aD of the same monomer include Asn237-Nd (aI)­Tyr152-Oz (aD) and Leu221-N (aH)­Asp133-Od2 (aC). Correspondingly, PrfA mutants lacking residues 207­209 (b12) or the last 17 residues (aH and aI) loose all DNA-binding affinity (Herler et al., 2001), presumably by destabilizing the DNA-binding domain. Monomer­monomer contacts involving aG, aH and aI include hydrogen bonds to the loop b6­b7 of the second monomer: Lys220-Næ (aH)­ Tyr82-O (b6­b7) and Glu223-Od (aH)-Tyr82-N (b6­b7). The DNA-binding domains are thus stabilized by an enlarged monomer­monomer interface, which is otherwise mainly created by extensive hydrophobic contacts between aC of one monomer and aC or loop b6­b7 of the second. Structure of PrfAG145S To rationalize structurally the increased DNA-binding affinity of the mutant PrfAG145S as compared to PrfAwt, we embarked on solving the crystal structure of PrfAG145S in addition to that of PrfAwt. PrfAG145S crystallized in space group C2 with four dimers per asymmetric unit. Identified initially as C222, the space group resulted in a stalled refinement, overcome by reducing the space group symmetry to C2. The apparent C222 symmetry, nevertheless, indicates that pairs of PrfAG145S dimers are structurally very similar. Over and above this symmetry, all eight monomers prove to be structurally invariant ­ as judged by error-scaled difference distance matrices (DDM) implemented in ESCET (Schneider, 2002). The only exception is that two monomers of different dimers lack electron density for residues 174­184 of the HTH motif, mirroring the disorder in this loop as described for PrfAwt above.

436 M. Eiting, G. Hagelüken, W.-D. Schubert and D. W. Heinz The structure of PrfAG145S (coloured by domain, PDBcode 2BGC) superimposed on PrfAwt (in grey) is shown in Fig. 2A. Comparing PrfAwt and PrfAG145S indicates that structural differences are not confined to the C-terminal domain, as could have been expected. As a result, superpositions were performed by initially including all Caatoms, and iteratively removing those deviating by more than 2.5 Å. The largest patch of residues excluded by this cut-off involves residues 168­185 of the HTH motif. Nevertheless, the PrfAwt and PrfAG145S are structurally similar (Fig. 2C), with an average r.m.s. deviation of 1.4 Å for all Ca-atoms. The C-terminal domain, however, reveals considerably larger differences (2.0 Å) than the N-terminal domain (0.6 Å). DNA-binding affinities of PrfAwt and PrfAG145S Binding affinities of PrfAwt and PrfAG145S for their target DNA were determined using surface plasmon resonance techniques (see Experimental procedures). Biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the PrfA box of the hly promoter were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated chip. Purified protein of different concentrations was passed over the immobilized DNA for 180 s, allowing the resonance signal to achieve a plateau value before passing protein-free buffer over the chip for dissociation, followed by washing to regenerate the chip. This procedure was performed in triplicate for each particular protein concentration allowing average equilibrium readout values to be calculated. Following normalization these values were plotted against the protein concentration ( and in Fig. 3). This allows the binding curve to be derived by non-linear regression (dotted lines) using the equation Rmax ¥ [PrfA ] + [PrfA ] ¥ N (Experimental procedures) K D + [PrfA ] yielding the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD). The term `[PrfA] ¥ N' was required to accommodate nonR eq =

Response units (RU) at state equilibrium are plotted against corresponding protein concentrations. The mean and the standard error of the mean (SEM) for each data point (experiments performed in triplicate) are shown by vertical lines. The binding curves resulting from specific PrfA-DNA binding (continuous lines), derived by subtracting the effect of non-specific binding (not shown) from the experimental curves (dashed), asymptotically approach comparable Rmax-values of 1240 ± 40 (PrfAG145S) and 1183 ± 60 (PrfAwt) RU. Dissociation constants are found to be (9 ± 1) ¥ 10-7 M for PrfAwt and (5 ± 1) ¥ 10-8 M for PrfAG145S.

physiological binding of PrfA (possibly to single-stranded DNA or hairpin loops). Subtraction of this term from the regression curve (continuous line in Fig. 3) shows that the curves resulting from specific binding of both PrfAwt and PrfAG145S asymptotically approach comparable Rmaxvalues. This is expected, as the number of binding sites available to both proteins on the detection chip is identical. The KD of PrfAwt is found to be 900 ± 100 nM while that of PrfAG145S is 50 ± 10 nM. The KD of PrfAwt is roughly comparable to a previous estimate of 200 nM (Sheehan et al., 1996). Similarly, the 18-fold tighter binding for PrfAG145S relative to PrfAwt (this work) is in good agreement with in vitro transcription assays that indicated a 2- to 16fold (Vega et al., 2004) and footprinting experiments that indicated a sevenfold increase (Vega et al., 1998).

Crystal structure of PrfA 437 Note that both PrfAwt and PrfAG145S as used in the described experiment bear an N-terminal His6-tag, a modification that, despite being spatially remote from the DNA-binding motif, has been interpreted to modify DNAbinding affinity (Böckmann et al., 1996; Dickneite et al., 1998), as opposed to Flag epitope-tagged PrfAwt (Vega et al., 1998; 2004). The structural implications, if any, of these tags and their influence on DNA binding currently remain unclear. Structural differences between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S PrfAwt and PrfAG145S are structurally overall similar (see above). Comparing them more closely reveals numerous differences, eminating from but not confined to the immediate neighbourhood of the mutation site. The amino acid Gly145 of PrfA is located half-way along a-helix aD facing aC and aH. It is partially buried by surrounding residues and well defined in the electron density map. In PrfAG145S, the newly introduced serine, positioned between aD and aC, is similarly well defined (Fig. 4). An immediate consequence of the mutation is a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of Ser145 and the carbonyl oxygen of Gly141, also in aD. On a larger scale, the spatially more demanding side chain of Ser145 forces aD and aC apart, causing aD to shift along its helix axis and inducing a bend in the C-terminal third of aC in PrfAwt to straighten in PrfAG145S. This straightening movement may be viewed as a rotation of ~11 around a hinge located near residue 127 (Fig. 5A). Overall, this causes the C-terminal ends of aC from opposite monomers to move towards each other creating several new hydrogen bonds including Ser135-O (aC)­Lys139-Nz (aD) (Fig. 5B). In PrfAwt, Phe134 is involved in monomer­monomer contacts at the dimer interface (Fig. 5C). In PrfAG145S, the mutationally induced separation of aC and aD partly exposes their common hydrophobic interface, causing the

438 M. Eiting, G. Hagelüken, W.-D. Schubert and D. W. Heinz aromatic side chain of Phe134 (aC) to flip around to fill the resulting hydrophobic pocket between aD and aC. In this orientation Phe134 forms van-der-Waals contacts to the methylene group of Ser145. The mutation G145S, furthermore, also affects the adjacent residue Gln146. In PrfAwt, Gln146 forms a hydrogen bond to carbonyl oxygen of Leu174 (aE) (not shown), but in PrfAG145S Gln146 is positioned to form a hydrogen bond with Lys130-Nz (aC) (Fig. 5C). The most dramatic difference between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S, however, involves the HTH motif (Fig. 2A and B). The loop aE­aF is disordered in both monomers of PrfAwt. The same disorder is observed in both monomers of PrfAwt crystallized in an unrelated packing arrangement (Thirumuruhan et al., 2003). In PrfAG145S, by contrast, loop aE­aF is resolved in six of eight monomers. Clearly, ordering of loop aE­aF correlates with the mutational state of PrfA rather than with crystal contacts involving the HTH motif such that the observed changes are unlikely to result from crystal packing effects. In addition to ordering of loop aE­aF, the a-helices aE and aF are considerably rearranged in PrfAG145S as compared to PrfAwt (Fig. 2A and B). aE is not merely translated relative to the remaining structure but more significantly undergoes an unusual shift in register by three residues. In PrfAwt residues 168­174 constitute aE changing to 171­177 in PrfAG145S. As a result, the loop b10-aE is extended by three residues (168­170) ­ freeing aE to move towards the dimer interface ­ and shortening loop aE­aF by three residues, possibly partly the reason for its stabilization. In addition, the recognition helix aF (184­195) adopts a bent conformation in PrfAG145S when compared with PrfAwt (Fig. 2B). Presumably, the change in distance between the N-terminal ends of aF and the stabilization of the loop aE­aF allows a better fit to the consecutive major grooves of the target DNA accounting for the significantly higher affinity of PrfAG145S for DNA compared with PrfAwt. with Ile180 (loop aE­aF) through its side chain methylene groups. Phe134 and Lys139 therefore appear pivotal in transmitting changes in aC to the HTH motif and hence in stabilizing the HTH motif. Another new stabilizing interaction is the van-der-Waals contact between Ser142 (aD) and Ser178 (loop aE­aF). Overall, these strong hydrophobic interactions between aC, aD and loop aE­aF stabilize the HTH motif in PrfAG145S. See Fig. 6 for a summary of interresidue contacts introduced by the mutation G145S. Outside the C-terminal domain and connecting helix aC, stabilization of the HTH motif, furthermore, is accompanied by a lateral movement of b5 (residues 47­59) of the N-terminal domain moving towards aE in PrfAG145S (Fig. 2). Stabilizing interactions include hydrogen bonds Asn59-Nd2 (b5)­Ser177-Og (aE) and Asn59-N (b5)­ Tyr176-O (aE), salt bridge Lys47-Nz (b4­b5)­Glu173-Od (aE) and hydrophobic contact I57-(b5)­Tyr176-(aE) (Fig. 6). A conformational change of Lys139 and Phe134 thus repositions and stabilizes the HTH motif and causes b5 to contact aE. Overall, the single substitution G145S thus induces considerable structural rearrangements involving helices aC and aD that indirectly serve to rearrange and stabilize the conformation of the HTH motif. Other significant changes between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S include differences in the loop b4­b5 and the monomer­monomer interface between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S.

Discussion PrfA is structurally related to Cap and CooA PrfA, positive regulatory factor A, of L. monocytogenes, has been identified as a member of the Crp/Fnr family, based on its related amino acid sequence (Körner et al., 2003). This relationship is also borne out by a structural comparison of PrfA, Cap (Weber and Steitz, 1987) and CooA (Lanzilotta et al., 2000), the only other members of this family characterized structurally to date (Fig. 7). Both Cap and CooA, like PrfA, are homodimers, consisting of an N-terminal b-barrel domain, a long a-helix (aC) linking N- and C-terminal domains, and a C-terminal, DNA-binding domain. Superpositions of the topologically related N-terminal b-barrel domains of PrfAG145S with Cap or CooA yield an r.m.s.d. between Ca-atoms of 1.32 Å and of 1.43 Å respectively. Nevertheless, despite similar topologies, considerable structural differences within this domain reflect the fact, that Cap and CooA provide binding pockets for starkly different effectors in dissimilar regions of the N-terminal domain. In the case of PrfA, it remains unclear whether such an effector is required, and if so, where it would be located (see below).

Stabilization of the HTH motif in PrfAG145S How then, is the mutational change communicated to the HTH motif? Stabilization of the HTH motif in PrfAG145S appears to result directly from the rearrangement of ahelices aC and aD. The mutation forces aC and aD apart, inducing aD to shift along its helix axis and causing aC to straighten. This exposes the hydrophobic interface between aC and aD and causes Phe134 (aC) to flip over to partly fill this void (see above). Phe134, however, not only forms van-der-Waals contacts to Ser145-Cb (aD) but also to Ser178-Cb (loop aE­aF). Lys139 (aD) similarly reorients forming hydrogen bonds to Ser135-O (aC) and Gly179-O (loop aE­aF), and hydrophobic interactions

In addition to the related N-terminal domain, Cap, CooA and PrfA also share topologically similar C-terminal domains bearing `winged' HTH motifs in which the classical HTH motif (aE, loop aE­aF and aF), required for DNA recognition (Fig. 7B), is complemented by additional b-strands and intervening loops (Brennan, 1993; Wintjens and Rooman, 1996; Gajiwala and Burley, 2000). R.m.s. deviations of 1.05 Å between C-terminal domains of both Cap or CooA and that of PrfAG145S underline their similarity. Cap and CooA are cofactor-dependent proteins, binding cAMP and CO respectively. Both proteins reveal a cofactor-induced increase in DNA-binding affinity. Crystal structures of cAMP-bound Capwt have been reported with and without DNA, while a crystal structure of apoCap remains to be solved. For CooA, a CO-free crystal structure without DNA is available (Lanzilotta et al., 2000). No member of the Crp/Fnr-family is thus presently known in the three key states (non-induced, induced but DNA-free and induced, DNA-bound) required to understand the process of induction and DNA-binding. The constitutively active mutant PrfAG145S is functionally analogous to CapA144T, a mutant form of Cap bearing the substitution A144T. The mutation is similarly located in helix aD (Weber et al., 1987) and also creates a constitutively active, cAMP-independent mutant of Cap. DNAbinding affinity of CapA144T is similar to that of Capwt/cAMP,

the cAMP activated form of wild-type Cap (Passner et al., 2000; Harman, 2001). The structure of CapA144T has also been determined, however, again with cAMP bound (Weber et al., 1987). Structures corresponding to (apo)PrfAwt and (apo)PrfAG145S, i.e. those of an apoCap and an apoCapA144T would be required to fill in the details of the working mechanism of Cap and its mutant CapA144T. An NMR-structure of apoCap is available (Won et al., 2000), but does not provide all the structural details required. Mechanism of activation as implied by PrfAG145S Overall, PrfAG145S adopts a conformation in which the C-terminal domains and especially the HTH motif are remarkably similar to Cap/cAMP, CapA144T and most significantly to DNA-bound Cap/cAMP (see Fig. 8). PrfAwt, by contrast, deviates significantly from all Cap/cAMP structures in that, amongst others, the position of aE is markedly shifted and that the loop aE­aF is disordered. In Cap, the equivalent loop bears residues, that crucially participate in binding DNA (Schultz et al., 1991; Parkinson et al., 1996). We therefore presume that repositioning of aE in PrfAG145S stabilizes the loop aE­aF allowing for improved interaction with DNA. Both CapA144T and Cap/ cAMP adopt an induced state, indicating that PrfA may therefore, like Cap, possess a distinct mechanism to

induce activation. We therefore propose that PrfAG145S mimics the induced state of DNA-bound PrfA, while PrfAwt represents the non-induced conformation and structurally corresponds to apoCap. Are the mechanisms of activation of Cap and PrfA comparable? In PrfA, activation involves separation of aC and aD, straightening of aC, leading to a reorientation and stabilization of the HTH motif including shifting of aE and the adjacent loops b10-aE and loop aE­aF. Changes in secondary structure, limited to b3, b3­b4, b6, b6­b7 and the hinge region of aC, have been reported for the NMRstructure of apoCap (Won et al., 2000). Foot-printing studies, however, indicate that structural changes also involve aD, aE, aF and b9 and b11 of the C-terminal domain (Baichoo and Heyduk, 1999). These changes mirror those observed between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S more closely. A movement of aC on induction has also been observed in

other proteins such as cAPK, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Diller et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2004), and Epac2, Rap-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Rehmann et al., 2003), that contain domains topologically similar to the N-terminal domain of Cap. A common mechanism may thus indeed exist for PrfA, Cap and related proteins. Another common feature of activation involves the rearrangement of b4­b5. Between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S, we interpret a lateral movement of b4­b5 as resulting from movement in aD and aC, as well as the stabilization of both aE and the HTH motif. In Cap, b4­b5 forms a flap over the cAMP-binding pocket, located at a distance of at least 10 Å from the DNA-binding domain. Binding of cAMP has consequently been proposed to both bend aC and induce b4­b5 to move towards the cAMP. The combination of these movements presumably optimizes the

Crystal structure of PrfA 441
Fig. 8. Superposition of PrfAwt and PrfAG145S upon DNA-bound Cap/cAMP (PDB-code: 2CGP) as obtained for the complete proteins from the Dali-server (Holm and Sander, 1998). Only the HTH motifs of PrfAwt (dark grey) and PrfAG145S (magenta) are shown for clarity, whereas Cap is shown in domain colours as defined in Fig. 1 and yellow HTH motif. Note that all major contacts between protein and DNA in DNA-bound Cap/cAMP involve the 14 central base pairs of the 22 bp Cap-DNArecognition sequence (Parkinson et al., 1996; Lawson et al., 2004). This clearly matches the 14 bp PrfA-box, supporting the depicted hypothesis that the DNA-binding mode of PrfA and Cap is similar. Central 14 bp are shown in light blue, the remaining base pairs in pale blue.

distance between the HTH motifs to induce DNA binding (Passner et al., 2000; Harman, 2001). Thus whereas movement of b4­b5 is assumed to be directly induced by cAMP-binding in Cap, the equivalent movement in PrfAG145S appears to be indirectly caused by mutational stabilization of the HTH motifs. Does PrfA require a cAMP-like effector? Binding of the allosteric effector cAMP to Cap induces conformational changes, particularly of the DNA-binding domain, increasing DNA-binding affinity by at least three (possibly more) orders of magnitude from non-specific to very tight binding (Harman, 2001). cAMP-independent mutants, such as CapA144T achieve a comparable DNAbinding affinity as induced Cap/cAMP by mimicking the cofactor-bound conformation (Weber et al., 1987). PrfAG145S is functionally and structurally similar to CapA144T, suggesting that PrfAG145S also adopts an induced conformation. In contrast to Cap, no ligand has, however, as yet been identified that could act as an allosteric effector of native PrfA. The cAMP-binding cassette (PBC) is conserved within the N-terminal domain of cAMP-binding proteins such as Cap, cAPK and Epac2 (Weber and Steitz, 1987; Diller et al., 2001; Rehmann et al., 2003). Although the Nterminal domain is topologically conserved in PrfA and CooA, the PBC itself is not (Fig. 9B). In PrfA, residues Ser128, Gln63 and Phe70 fill this space confirming earlier studies indicating that cAMP is not an effector of PrfA

(Vega et al., 1998). However, the b-roll motif of the Nterminal domain is remarkably malleable, providing binding sites for other effectors such as CO or a-L-arabinose in CooA and AraC (Soisson et al., 1997; Lanzilotta et al., 2000). In CooA, loop b6­b7 and aC bind a haem group, which in turn binds CO. L-arabinose binding site in AraC, by contrast, is located within the b-barrel of the N-terminal domain. Displaying the surface of PrfAwt reveals a distinct tunnel between the N-terminal b-barrel and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of each monomer (Fig. 9A). The C-terminal helices aH and aI are crucial in forming this tunnel as are aC and b5. Repositioning of aE closes the tunnel at the end facing the DNA-binding domains in PrfAG145S. In Cap, a similar tunnel between the N-terminal and C-terminal domain bears the cofactor cAMP, raising the possibility that the tunnel may have an equivalent function in PrfA. Interestingly, difference electron density is visible within the tunnel in one monomer of PrfAwt and in two monomers of PrfAG145S (not shown). Based on its structure, this has been identified as DTT in PrfAG145S (added during protein crystallization to prevent cystein oxidation) binding non-specifically to PrfA. Hence, apart from the dramatic conformational changes in the HTH region between PrfAwt and PrfAG145S, the tunnel lends further support to the hypothesis that PrfA like Cap and CooA may need an effector to induce activation. The mutation G145S is not located immediately adjacent to the tunnel. This, however, is also true of the muta-

442 M. Eiting, G. Hagelüken, W.-D. Schubert and D. W. Heinz Furthermore, PrfA is fully active on entry into host cells, while only weakly active outside the host (Moors et al., 1999; Shetron-Rama et al., 2002). This may be the result of a change in temperature, activating PrfA-translation, or from a post-translational modification. Alternatively, PrfA could be activated by a ­ possibly hostderived ­ cofactor (Ripio et al., 1997a; Vega et al., 1998). Listeria monocytogenes has recently been shown to produce a low-molecular-weight inhibitor of PrfA (Ermolaeva et al., 2004) that could bind to a specific binding site potentially within the described tunnel. Upon contact with the host this inhibitor could be displaced by a hostderived effector. The inhibitor does not, however, inhibit PrfAG145S indicating that the mutation may lock PrfA into its activated conformation blocking the inhibitor binding site or preventing the inhibitor from fixing a non-induced conformation. A constitutively active PrfA would presumably be disadvantageous to L. monocytogenes because of the cytotoxicity of high concentrations of listeriolysin O and the concomitant activation of extracellular host defence mechanisms (Glomski et al., 2003). A host-derived cofactor would on the other hand allow the precise spatial and temporal activation of PrfA, complementing the known activating mechanisms of PrfA.

Conclusions The substitution of Gly145 by serine serves to induce dramatic conformational rearrangements in PrfA culminating in the stabilization and repositioning of the DNAbinding domain. As a result PrfAG145S resembles the DNAbinding conformation of Cap. The mechanisms of induction of Cap and PrfA also share numerous features, raising the question of a cofactor-mediated induction mechanism in PrfA. The hypothesis is supported by the observation of a tunnel in PrfA, matching a related although differently positioned tunnel in Cap. The size of the tunnel would require a small, partly hydrophobic, possibly aromatic compound, although it is difficult at present to identify its characteristics in detail. The identification of such an activator, possibly host-derived, would allow the pathogenicity of L. monocytogenes to be linked to its physical interaction with its host.

tion A144T in Cap, which, although not immediately adjacent to the binding site of cAMP, achieves the same conformational change. Our DNA-binding analysis indicates that the dissociation constant of purified PrfAwt for the perfectly palindromic hly PrfA promoter is (9 ± 1) ¥ 10-7 M, compared with (5 ± 1) ¥ 10-8 M for PrfAG145S. The affinity of apoCap for its DNA recognition sequence appears to be less than 1 ¥ 10-5 M, while that of Cap/cAMP is (6.3 ± 0.9) ¥ 10-9 M for optimized DNA sequences (Dai et al., 2004). While PrfAwt could thus function as a transcription factor without the need of additional activation, its DNA-binding affinity is significantly (two orders of magnitude) lower than that of Cap/cAMP. The affinity constant of PrfAG145S partially approaches the value of Cap/cAMP, indicating that a structural rearrangement of the HTH motif significantly increases the affinity of PrfA for DNA. Constitutively active mutants of Cap also show lower DNA-binding affinities than Cap/cAMP, indicating that an activator of PrfA could further increase DNA-binding affinity of PrfA to levels comparable to Cap/cAMP.

The vector pGEX-6P1-PrfA was kindly provided by T. Chakraborty (U. Giessen, Germany). Because of problems during GST-PrfA fusion protein purification, PrfA (SWISSPROT-ID P22262) was subcloned into the vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) to produce an N-terminal His-tag fusion protein. Site-directed mutation of PrfA at residue 145 was

introduced using the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The primers used are: 5¢-ggaagcttggctctatttgctctca acttttaatcctgacc-3¢ (forward) 5¢-gtcaggattaaaagttgagagcaaat agagccaagcttcc-3¢ (reverse) (mutation site is underlined). Both PrfAwt and PrfAG145S were expressed in M15 cells (Qiagen). Transformed Escherichia coli were grown at 37C to an optical density (600 mM) of 0.7 in 2xYTmedium (plus 50 mg ml-1 kanamycin and 100 mg ml-1 ampicillin). Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and cultures were incubated over night at 22C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 4200 U l-1 benzonase and 1 tablet l-1 Complete protease inhibitor (Roche) and lysed by French Press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Soluble PrfA was initially purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen), followed by cation exchange chromatography (MonoS, Pharmacia) and gel filtration (Superdex 75 HR 16/60 column, Pharmacia). Protein quality was analysed by SDS-PAGE and pure protein (>99%) in 50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 6.7, 250 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT was concentrated to 6 mg ml-1.

Crystallization
Crystals were grown using equal volumes of N-terminally His6-tagged protein (6 mg ml-1) and reservoir solutions in 24-well hanging-drop vapour-diffusion plates at 20C. Reservoirs for PrfAwt crystals contained 20% (w/v) PEG 6000, 100 mM Na-MES pH 6.5 and 1 M lithium chloride. For cryo-protection, reservoir solution was supplemented with 20% PEG 400. PrfAwt crystals belong to space group P21. Unit-cell parameters are a = 56.0 Å, b = 80.7 Å, c = 61.0 Å, b = 111.8. For one dimer per asymmetric unit, VM is 2.3 Å3 Da-1 and the solvent content 47.0%. PrfAG145S crystals of space group C2 (a = 117.2 Å, b = 100.2 Å, c = 189.5 Å, b = 90.3) were grown using 12% (w/v) PEG 8000, 100 mM Na-MES pH 6.9 and 300 mM Naacetate. Crystal diffraction was improved from initial 3.5 Å2.4 Å by reducing the solvent content using a free-mounting system (Kiefersauer et al., 2000) (Proteros biostructures GmbH, Martinsried). A packing model of four PrfAG145Sdimers per asymmetric unit results in a VM of 2.55 Å3 Da-1 and a solvent content of 51.4%.

Surface plasmon resonance
Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a BIAcore biosensor system 2000 TM at 25C. Biotinylated oligonucleotides (28 bp) containing the PrfA-box of hly promoter were passed over flow cell 4 (Fc4) of a streptavidincoated sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor) until a suitable coating level was achieved. To create double-stranded DNA, saturating amounts of non-biotinylated complementary DNA was injected over Fc4. Fc3 was not coated and served as reference. A flow rate of 10 ml min-1 was used throughout. A modified HBS-EP buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 8.5, 200 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA) was used as running buffer and for PrfA dilutions between 20 mM and 20 nM. DNA binding was measured for 180 s for PrfA until binding approached a steady state, followed by dissociation for another 120 s and surface-regeneration with 10 ml of 1 M NaCl. Each run was performed in triplicate using pure, N-terminally His-tagged protein. For the evaluation, the reference flow cell signal was subtracted from each sensorgram and the resulting curves were aligned to a common baseline. The response measurement at equilibrium was plotted against the respective protein concentration. Because of non-specific binding of the protein to single-stranded DNA or hairpin loops, a simple 1:1 binding isotherm is insufficient to model the observed data. The isotherm R eq =

Data collection, structure determination and refinement
X-ray diffraction data of both PrfAwt and PrfAG145S were collected using synchrotron radiation on MARCCD detectors (marresearch, Norderstedt), PrfAwt at beamline BL1 (BESSY II, Berlin, Germany) at l = 1.54 Å and PrfAG145S at beamline BW6 (DESY Hamburg, Germany) at l = 1.05 Å. Data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and TRUNCATE (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using EPMR (Kissinger et al., 1999) and PrfA (PDB-ID: 1omi) (Thirumuruhan et al., 2003) as search model. O was used for manual model building and structural analysis (Jones et al., 1991). Refinement was performed using CNS (Bruenger et al., 1998) and REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 1997) excluding 5% of the data for free R-factor calculation (Bruenger, 1992). Water molecules were added using ARP_Waters (Lamzin and Wilson, 1997). PrfAwt was refined to a resolution of 2.7 Å and PrfAG145S to 2.3 Å. PrfAG145S was initially indexed as C222 but refinement stalled at a high R-factor. Reducing the symmetry to C2 allowed refinement to proceed. No electron density is visible for residues 174­184 of PrfAwt. This loop is also somewhat disordered in two of eight monomers of PrfAG145S. Structures were validated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHATIF (Vriend, 1990). Data-collection and processing statistics for both proteins are shown in Table 1. Graphical representations were prepared using the programs MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), BOBSCRIPT (Esnouf, 1999), RASTER3D (Merrit and Bacon, 1997), GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1993) and rendered with POV-Ray (http://www.povray.org). LSQKAB (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) was used for molecular superpositions, employing a cut-off of 3 Å for Ca-atom deviations. Error-scaled DDM plots were generated using ESCET (Schneider, 2000). Structural neighbours were identified by the DALI server (Holm and Sander, 1998) while a structure-based sequence alignment was prepared with ESPript (Gouet et al., 1999).
