A Molecular Orbital Theoretical Study on the Acid-base Property and Reactivity of the Charge Relay System in a-Chymotrypsin
HAJIME P. KITAYAMA AND HIDEO FUKUTOME Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan (Received 14 June 1974, and in revised form 13 June 1975) The acid-base property and reactivity of the charge relay system in c+chyn'iOtrypSin are studied by a molecular orbital theoretical method. It is shown that the observed pK,, about 7 in the activity of the enzyme is a result of a compensation of a pK, raising effect of the basic assistance of Asp-102 to His-57 and a PK. lowering effect of the distorted hydrogen bond of the ligand water to His-57. The former effect is shown to raise the pK, of His-57 by about 4 pK units but the latter lowers it by about the same amount leading to apparent pK, about 7. Calculation on the proton transfer energies in the charge relay system indicates that the proton configuration with the anionic Asp-102 and the neutral His-57 is of the lowest energy, but the configuration with the neutral Asp-102 and the anionic His-57 lies at the energy not so far from the lowest energy con6guration.

The efficiency of the proton abstraction from Ser-195 by the coupled
system of His-57 and Asp-102 is high in spite of the distorted hydrogen bond between Ser-195 and His-57. Implications of these results for a-chymotrypsin catalysis are discussed.

1. Introduction
X-ray diffraction studies on a-chymotrypsin (Matthews Sigler, Henderson & Blow, 1967; Sigler, Blow, Matthews t Henderson, 1968; Steitz, Henderson & Blow, 1969; Henderson, 1970) have revealed that the active site of the enzyme involves an array of the aminoacid residues serine (Ser)-195, histidine (His)-57 and aspartic acid (Asp)-102 which appear to be linked by hydrogen bonds. The system of Ser, His and Asp linked with similar geometry have also been found in the active sites of the other serine proteases, elastase (Shotton & Watson, 1970), trypsin (Ruhlmann, Kukla, Schwager, Bartels & Huber, 1973) and subtilisin (Wright, Alder k Kraut, 1969), suggesting that they are the central machineries in the catalytic mechanism of the serine 1 T.B. 1

proteases. Blow and co-workers, based on their X-ray studies, proposed a model of the catalytic mechanism of a-chymotrypsin (Blow, Birktoft & Hartley, 1969), in which Asp-102 acts as an acid-base assistant group to promote the general acid-base catalytic power of His-57. A negative charge at the position of Asp-102 is assumed to migrate through the hydrogen bonds mediated by His-57 up to Ser-195 forming a reactive alchoxide nucleophile. Based on this model, they named the hydrogen bonding system of Ser-195, His-57 and Asp-102 the charge relay system. The model of catalysis in terms of the charge relay system is consistent with mechanistic observations (Bender & Kezdy, 1964), in particular, with the presence of a negative charge at the active site of the enzyme (Johnson & Knowles, 1966). Although this model is quite attractive, there remains a yet unsolved problem. It is well known that the active site of a-chymotrypsin involves an ionizable group with pK, about 7 which is identified with the imidazole group of His-57 in the charge relay system. The observed pK, of 7 means that, in spite of the assumed acid-base assistance of Asp-102, the imidazole group of His-57 should have the apparent pK, not different from that of the unassisted one. According to Bronsted's structure-reactivity relationship, this implies that no rate enhancement in the general acid-base catalysis of His-57 is expected by the assistance of Asp-102. Thus, one is led to an apparent dilemma that if the charge relay system is consistent with the observed pK,,, it would not work as a rate accelerating machinery. In order to assess the role of the charge relay system, in particular, that of Asp-102 in the catalysis of a-chymotrypsin, one should solve this dilemma. In addition to X-ray evidences, a recent NMR study (Robillard & Shulman, 1972) has also provided evidences supporting existence of the hydrogen bond between His-57 and Asp-102. If the hydrogen bond is of real existence, it is natural to expect that the cationic charge on the protonated His-57 and the negative charge on Asp-102 interact strongly, leading to a shift of pK, of His-57. Thus, the observed pK, about 7, which shows no appreciable shift, seems to be abnormal and the dilemma stated above appears to be closely related to the abnormal stiffness of pK, of His-57. In this paper, we study the acid-base property of the charge relay system by a molecular orbital (MO) theoretical method. We shall show that the acidbase property of the charge relay system are governed not only by the assistance of Asp-102 to His-57, but also by the unusual distorted hydrogen bonds between His-57 and a solvent water molecule or Ser-195 (Birktoft & Blow, 1972). The observed pK, of about 7 is shown to be the result of a compensation of the pK, raising effect of the assistance of Asp-102 to His-57 and the pK, lowering effect of the distorted hydrogen bond between the ligand water molecule and His-57. The hypothetical His-57 without the assistance of

Asp-102 and with the distorted hydrogen bond to the water molecule is shown to be a poor base with pK, about 2. Furthermore, it is shown that the system composed of His-57 and Asp-102 (abbreviated as A-H system hereafter), in spite of the distorted hydrogen bond to Ser-195, behaves as if it is a very strong base with PK. about 11 when it abstracts a proton from Ser-195. In this case, His-57 looks somewhat like an imidazole anion, which is a very strong base, produced by the assistance of Asp-102. These results seem to offer a reasonable sohrtion to the above dilemma and indicate an essential participation of Asp-102 to the catalysis. 2. Model of the Charge Relay System and Method of Calculation In the present calculation, Ser-195, His-57 and Asp-102 in the charge relay system are replaced by a methanol, a 5-methyl-imidazole and an acetic acid, respectively. Since the errors for the co-ordinates obtained from the X-ray diffraction study for cl-chymotrypsin (Birktoft, Matthews & Blow, 1969) are too large to use in MO calculations, we use the co-ordinates derived from more rigorous X-ray studies on the corresponding small molecules (Sutton, 1958). The mutual configurations between the monomeric groups are fixed to those given in the X-ray study of the enzyme. The position of Oy of Ser-195 (oxygen atom of methanol) in the native enzyme was guessed from the positions of 0' in the indoleacryroyl and tosyl enzymes by rotating it around the C?-C@ axis of Ser-195 according to Henderson (Henderson, 1970). The position used in this study is the average of the guessed one obtained from the two inhibited enzymes. It is in good agreement with the optimized position obtained by Birktoft & Blow (1972). The model of the charge relay system is depicted in Fig. 1 and the co-ordinates of atoms are given in Table 1. The co-ordinates of hydrogen atoms concerned with the hydrogen bonds are determined as follows. The hydrogen atom attached to 0' of Ser-195 or to Nz2 of His-57 is assumed to have the same bond lengths and bond angles as those in the monomeric units and the OH bond of Ser-195 is put in the direction minimizing the distance between H of the hydroxyl group of Ser-195 and N"' of His-57. The hydrogen atom attached to Oa2 of Asp-102 or Nd' of His-57 is placed on the line joining Od2 and Ndl and the bond lengths of OH and NH are assumed to be the same as those in the monomeric units, because the hydrogen bond between Asp-102 and His-57 is almost linear. The positions of the protons attached to Na2 of His-57 and Od2 of Asp-102 are shown by dashed circles in Fig. 1. The two positions of the proton in the distorted hydrogen bond between 0' of Ser-195 and N*' of His-57 are close to the equilibrium positions of the proton obtained by Ingraham (1973).

difference in geometry between carboxyl and carboxylate states of the carboxylic acid moiety of Asp-102 is taken into consideration. Asp-102 is hydrogen bonding not only to His-57 but also to the main chain peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214. When we take into consideration the effect of these groups, they are replaced by a formamide and a methanol, respectively and His-57 by an imidazole, instead of a 5-methylimidazole, in order to save computation time. The relative configurations of these groups are also determined from the X-ray data of the enzyme. The direction of the hydroxyl group of Set-214 is determined so as to minimize the distance between its proton and Odz of Asp-102. An X-ray study (Birktoft & Blow, 1972) has indicated that a water molecule at a fixed position is hydrogen bonded to NC2 of His-57. It is probable that the proton required for the ionization of His-57 is provided from the fixed water since it seems to be the water interacting most strongly with NC2 of His-57, which is the atoms to be protonated on the ionization, and other positions accessible for water molecules do not appear to be more favorable for the protonation of His-57. Hence, we assume that the proton in the ionization of His-57 is transferred from the tied water. The two hydrogen bonds joining the fured water and Oy of Ser-195 to NC2 of His-57 are distorted in a symmetric manner (Fig. 1). If a water molecule is placed at the position optimal to the hydrogen bonding to N"' of His-57, the distance between Oy of Ser-195 and the oxygen atom of the water becomes about 1.25 A which is much shorter than the van der Waals contact distance. Therefore, the distortion of the hydrogen bond between the fixed water and NC2 of His-57 is thought to be due to a steric hindrance of Ser-195 to the water. The proton of the fIxed water hydrogen bonded to NE2 of His-57 is put on the line joining the oxygen atom of the water to NL2 if His-57 when it is at the position near the water. When it is transferred to NC2 of His-57, it is placed at the position indicated by the dashed circle Hk in Fig. 1. The other OH bond of the water is put on the plane perpendicular to the imidazole plane of His-57. Throughout this study, we use the CND0/2 approximation (Pople & Segal, 1966) in SCF MO calculations and computations were carried out on a Facom-230-60 Computer at The Computer Center of Kyoto University. 3. A Correlation Between MO Theoretical Proton Transfer Energy and Observed pK of Acids and Bases Our aim is to study the acid-base property and reactivity of the charge relay system by MO theoretical calculations on the proton transfer processes involved. It is well known that the acid-base property and the general acidbase catalytic power of acids and bases are governed by their PK. In order

for an MO calculation to have at least a semi-quantitative significance relevant to observations, it is necessary that MO theory may provide a quantity with a correlation to observed pK of acids and bases. Consider the ionization process of a base in aqueous solution represented by the formula B+HzO + BH'+OH-. (1) pK of the base is proportional to the free energy change in reaction (1): pK, = 14-pK, = AF/2.3 RT. (2) In a gas phase reaction, the observable proton transfer energy (the enthalpy change) is AE = E(BH+)+E(OH-)-E(B)-E(H,O). (3) In aqueous solution, however, the AE defined by equation (3) does not correspond to the observable enthalpy change in reaction (1) since it entirely neglect the effects of solvent water. Reaction (1) involves complex interactions of the base with solvent water as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2. In aqueous solution, the base is surrounded by water molecules and making hydrogen bonds with them with a large statistical probability. Protonation of the base is considered to occur by a proton transfer from a hydrogen bonded water to the base. A rearrangement in the statistical distribution of the surrounding water molecules, i.e., a change in the polarization occurs accompanied with the proton transfer. The hydroxide ion formed migrates away from the base

by successive proton transfers through networks of hydrogen bonds in water. It is very difficult to calculate on an apriori basis the free energy change in the reaction (1) with such complicated interactions of solvent water as sketched above. Hence, we consider the following very much simplified model system and examine a posteriori whether the proton transfer energy in the model system has a correlation to observed pK,. In the ionization process shown in Fig. 2, the free energy difference between the states (b) and (c) is expected small since any hydrogen bond in aqueous solution brings little or only a little stabilization in free energy due to the competition with the hydrogen bonding to solvent water (Jencks, 1969). So, we consider only the proton transfer in the hydrogen bonded complex of a base and a water [the step from (a) to (b) in Fig. 21, which is the central chemical process of the reaction. We neglect the contribution of other surrounding water molecules, i.e. the multiple hydrogen bonding and the polarization interaction. We calculate by the CND0/2 method the proton transfer energy (4) in the hydrogen bonded complex of a base and a water. Plausibility of using AE defined by equation (4) as a quantity to be correlated to pK is, however, not obvious from the above argument only. So, we calculated AE for many bases and conjugated bases of acids and examined the correlation between it and observed PK.. In the calculations of AE the following geometry of base-water systems was used. The hydrogen bond between the base and the water was assumed to be linear except for unprotonated anilines and the distance between the proton donor and acceptor atoms was fixed at 2.7 A. The geometries within the base and the water were assumed to be unchanged by the hydrogen bonding. In the cases of bases with a conjugated plane and conjugate bases of aliphatic alcohols, the HOH plane of the water was put perpendicularly to the conjugate plane and the COH plane of alcohols, respectively. Some test calculations showed that the direction of the HOH plane of the water affected AE only a little. In the case of anilines, the water was put in the plane perpendicular to the aromatic plane and including the CN bond of anilines and an OH bond of the water was directed toward the amino-nitrogen making an angle by 109.5" with the CN bond. The geometry of the amino-group was changed from trigonal to tetragonal on proton transfer from the water. The result of the calculation is given in Table 2 and the correlation between AE and observed pK, is shown in Fig. 3. We see from Fig. 3 that there is a correlation between AE and pK,, in a wide range of pK, in spite of the crudeness of the model except for the large deviations in carboxylic acids and AE = E(BH+ - - -OH-)-E(B- -HOH),

ammonia. Carboxylic acids and ammonia may make multiple hydrogen bonds with water. To see the effect of the multiple hydrogen bonding on the AE-pK, correlation, we calculated the proton transfer energy for the acetic acid and ammonia added with one or more hydrogen bonded water molecules. As seen in Fig. 3, addition of one or more hydrogen bonded waters progressively improves the deviations from the AE-pK, correlation line. However, the improvement is not sufficient enough, and some other factors also seem to be responsible for the deviations. It is to be noted that the structurally related series of bases with a conjugated plane appear to lie on local correlation lines with less scatterings and steeper slopes than the overall correlation. Such a better local correlation is reasonable because the effects of solvent water would be similar in bases with similar structures. From the result in Fig. 3, it seems plausible to discuss the acid-base property of a system based on a CND0/2 calculation for the proton transfer energy AE defined by equation (4). If the ionizing group of the system is of similar structure to some of the bases in Fig. 3 with a good AE-pK, correlation, then we may obtain a semi-quantitative though rough estimation for the unknown pK, of the system from the calculated value of AE using the AE-pK, correlation line in Fig. 3.

In the charge relay system, the imidazole of His-57 is the ionizing group of the system which is at the surface of the enzyme and directly interacting with solvent water. We see from Fig. 3 that imidazoles exhibit a good AE-pK, correlation in both of the cationic and anionic ionizations. For the carboxylic acid moiety of Asp-102, on the other hand, the AE-pK, correlation is bad. However, Asp- 102 is buried inside of the enzyme and not directly interacting with solvent water. The effect of Asp-102 buried in an environment of

low dielectric constant might be better described by the MO theoretical calculation, which approximates the process in vacua, rather than by its pK, in water. Hence, the bad AE-pKa correlation of acetic acid would not be a serious problem in estimating the effect of Asp-102 in the ionization of the charge relay system. 4. Analysis of the Acid-base Property of the Charge Relay System The ionization of the charge relay system, which is assumed to occur primarily by a proton transfer from the fixed water to NE2 of His-57, is expected to be most seriously affected by the basic assistance of Asp-102 to His-57 and the steric hindrance of Ser-195 to the fixed water. The hydrogen bonds of the peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214 to Asp-102 are also expected to affect the power of Asp-102 in the basic assistance to His-57. In order to see the effects of these factors on the ionization of the charge relay system, we calculated and compared the proton transfer energies from a water to the imidazole in the following systems: (a) His-57 (5-methyl imidazole) without the assistance of Asp-102, (denoted as H); (b) His-57 with the assistance of Asp-102 (deprotonated acetic acid), (denoted as A-H); (c) The A-H system (an imidazole instead of a 5-methyl imidazole was used as the H in the present case) with Asp-102 hydrogen bonded to the peptide group of His-57 (formamide) and the hydroxyi group of Ser-214 (methanol), (denoted as A*-H); (d) The hydrogen bonded complex of Asp-102, His-57 and Ser-195 (methanol), (denoted as A-H-S). For systems (a), (b) and (c), the proton transfer energies were calculated for the two different geometries of the fixed water: (1) the water linearly hydrogen bonded to Ne2 of His-57 with the NO distance 2.7 A and the HOH plane of the water put perpendicularly to the imidazole plane, (2) the water distortedly hydrogen bonded to NC2 of His-57 in the same geometry as the charge relay system (see Fig. 1). For system (d), the calculation was carried out only in the geometry (2), because the geometry (1) is impossible, due to the large steric repulsion between the water and Ser-195. In systems (b), (c) and (d), the two different protonated states are possible: the neutral state of Asp-102 and His-57 in which the proton attached to Nd' of His-57 is transferred to Od2 of Asp-102 simultaneously as the protonation of NE2 of His-57 and the zwitter ionic state in which no coupled proton transfer occurs and His-57 becomes a cation but Asp-102 remains as an anion. In order to see which is the more stable in the two protonated states, we calculated AE for the two types of protonation in system (b). For systems (c) and (d), only the AE for the former type of proton transfer was calculated. In the case of (d), the OH bond of Ser-195 was swung, with a rotation by

122.4" around CB-Oy axis of Ser-195 simultaneously as the protonation of NE2 of His-57 in order to avoid the steric repulsion between the protons at Ne2 of His-57 and 07 of Ser-195. The results of the calculations are given in Table 3. The BE's for systems (a), (b) and (d) are also depicted by the dashed lines in Fig. 3. Making use of the AE-pK,, correlation line in Fig. 3, we may estimate pK, of these systems from the calculated values of AE. Thus estimated pK, values are also given in Table 3. They are of course rough and only semi-quantitative estimations but will give a concrete image about the acid-base strengths of the systems.

From the AE's of (b) and (b') systems in Table 3, we see that the neutral state is lower in energy than the zwitter ionic state in the protonated A-H system as proposed by Blow et al. (1969), the results for systems (a) and (b) show that the basic assistance of Asp-102, which leads to the coupled proton transfer in the ionization, raises pK, of the A-H system by about 4 to 5 pK units compared to that of the unassisted His-57. The result for (bl) shows that the A-H system is a strong base with p& about I1 if it is capable of forming an optimal linear hydrogen bond to the water without the steric hindrance of Ser-195. On the other hand, the results for the two geometries (1) and (2) of the water show that the distorted hydrogen bond of the water to N"' of His-57 lowers pK, of every systems by about 4 to 5 pK units compared to those of the systems with the linear hydrogen bond to the water.

hypothetical His-57 without the assistance of Asp-102 but with the steric hindrance of Ser-195 is a very poor base with pK, about 2 as seen in the result for (a2). The hydrogen bonds of the peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214 to Asp-102 somewhat weakens the power of Asp-102 in the basic assistance to His-57 as seen in the result for (c). A downward shift in the pK, value of the A-H system by about 1 pKunit is brought about by them, but it is within the error range in the estimation of pK, from the AE-pK, correlation line. So that, it would be safe to say that they are not very important factors in determining the ionization behavior of the charge relay system. The estimated pK, values for systems (b2), (~2) and (d) are in agreement with the observed pK, of a-chymotrypsin in the error range of the present method to guess pK, from AE. The present analysis indicates that the observed pK, about 7 of the charge relay system is a result of a compensation of the two effects, the pK, raising effect of the basic assistance of Asp-102 to His-57 and the pK, lowering effect of the distorted hydrogen bonding of the fixed water to His-57 caused by the steric hindrance of Ser-195. The results for (b2) and (d) show that the electronic influence of Ser-195 to the acid-base property of the charge relay system is small though its steric effect to the fixed water is very important.
5. Proton Transfer Process in the Charge Relay System

The charge relay system has the four different proton configurations as depicted in Fig. 4. We calculated the total and relative energies of the four proton configurations in the A-H-S and the A*-H-S (the A-H-S system with Asp-102 hydrogen bonded to the peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214) systems. The results are given in Table 4. We see that the lowest energy configuration of the two movable protons is configuration (a) with the neutral Ser-195 and His-57 and the anionic Asp-102 which was considered to be the initial state of the catalysis (Blow, et al., 1969). Configuration (b) in which the proton at N" of His-57 is transferred to Oa2 of Asp-102 and His-57 becomes anionic is the second lowest energy configuration. Among configurations (c) and (d) with a proton abstracted from Ser-195, state (c) with the zwitter ionic A-H system is higher in energy than state (d) with the neutral A-H system. Therefore, the proton configuration in the stage of the nucleophilic attack of the alchoxide anion of Ser-195 should be state (d) as proposed by Blow et al. (1969). The hydrogen bonds of the peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214 to Asp-102 somewhat push up the energies of states (b), (c) and (d) relative to (a), but the ordering of the states are not changed.

State (b) with an energy intermediate between states (a) and (b) may arise as an intermediate state in the process of formation of state (d). State (b) involves an imidazole anion which is a very strong base and capable to abstract a proton easily from the alcohol of Ser-195. The energy required to produce state (b) from state (a) is smaller than that required to produce an imidazole anion from a neutral imidazole by means of the proton abstraction by a hydroxide anion (see entry 16 of Table 1). This indicates that Asp-102

of imidazole anion. Furthermore, the concentration of hydroxide anion in water at neutral pH is only of the order of lo-' but Asp-102 is always present in the vicinity of His-57. Taking this effective concentration effect into consideration, the efficiency of Asp-102 in the production of the imidazole anion of His-57 would exceed 10' compared to that of hydroxide anion in water. In order to evamate the capacity of the A-H (and A*-H) system in the proton abstraction from Ser-195, we calculated the energies required in the proton abstraction from Ser-195 by the neutral and anionic His-57 without the assistance of Asp-102 but with the same relative geometry to Ser-195 as the charge relay system and compared them with those by the A-H and A*-H systems (Table 5). We seefrom Table 5 that the energy of the deprotonation of Ser-195 in the charge relay system is intermediate between those by the

neutral and anionic unassisted imidazoles but somewhat nearer to that by the imidazole anion. This indicates that the assistance of Asp-102 endows His-57 with a character intermediate between the neutral and anionic unassisted imidazoles but somewhat resembling an imidazole anion in the capacity to abstract a proton from Ser-195. The hydrogen bonds of the peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214 to Asp-102 somewhat weakens this role of Asp-102. The proton transfer energies in the similar systems in which a water, instead of an alcohol (Ser-195), is linearly hydrogen bonded to NeZ of His-57 are also listed in Table 5. It is remarkable that in spite of the distorted hydrogen bonding the proton transfer energies from the alcohol of Ser-195 are almost identical with those from the linearly hydrogen bonded water. This indicates that the ionization of the alcohol with a distorted hydrogen bond to imidazole

is carried out with an almost same efficiency as the ionization of the water ideally hydrogen bonded to imidazole. It has been known (Jencks & Gilchrist, 1962) that alchoxide anion has a stronger nucleophilicity than hydroxide anion in spite of their similar pK, values. In addition to this merit in the use of an alcohol as a nucleophile, the present result indicates that alcohol has another merit in the ionization efficiency to overcome the disadvantage of the distorted hydrogen bond. The similarity of the proton abstraction energy from Ser-195 to that from the linearly hydrogen bonded water shows that the A-H system behaves as if a base with pK, about 11 in the proton abstraction from Ser-195 (see Table 3).

6. Discussion The present calculations have indicated that the observed pK,, about 7 in the activity of a-chymotrypsin does not necessarily imply that a simple histidine not very much different from the isolated one is involved in the catalysis of the enzyme. If His-57 is the ionizable group responsible for the observed pK, and the interaction of it to Ser-195, Asp-102 and a ligand water molecule as revealed by X-ray studies (Birktoft BE Blow, 1972) is of real catalytic significance as interpreted by Blow and co-workers, the observed pK, of about 7 is a result of a compensation of the pK, raising effect of Asp102 to His-57, which leads to pK, of His-57 raised up by about 4 to 5 pK units, and the pK, lowering effect of the distorted hydrogen bond between His-57 and the ligand water molecule caused by the steric hindrance of Ser195, which leads to pK, of His-57 lowered by about 4 to 5 units. The hypothetical His-57 without the assistance of Asp-102 and with a distorted hydrogen bond to the ligand water molecule will be a very poor base with pK, about 2. The assistance of Asp-102 recovers the basic&y of His-57 to the usual level of imidazole. In this sense, the assistance of Asp-102 is essential to the catalysis of the charge relay system. Hunkapillar Smallcombe, Whitaker & Richards (1973) have recently provided 13C!NMR evidences in a-lytic protease to show that the protonated state of the A-H system corresponding to pK, about 7 is the state with neutral Asp and His but not their zwitter ionic state. In the present calculation, the protonated state of the A-H system giving pK, about 7 is the state with neutral Asp and His but not the zwitter ionic state. This is in agreement with their result. According to Brsnsted's structure-reactivity relationship, the apparent pK, about 7 of His-57 in the charge relay system means that its general acid-base reactivity is of the same order as the unassisted imidazole. Then, a question arises why such a complicated machinery as the charge relay system is evolved

in the enzyme. A possible reason is the stereochemical requirement for the catalytic processes. According to the widely accepted reaction model for the catalysis of a-chymotrypsin (Bender & Kezdy, 1964), His-57 should act twice as the general acid-base catalyst in both of the acylation and deacylation steps. It acts as a general base catalyst in the stage of the nucleophilic attack of Ser-195 to the substrate or the attack of a water to the acylenzyme leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate and as a general acid catalyst in the stage of the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate. In order that these two stages may proceed with a stereochemical smoothness for the substrate fixed on the surface of the enzyme, an appropriate shift in the position of the acid-base catalytic group is required. To avoid such a movement of the catalytic group, Bender & Kezdy (1964) once proposed a model with two catalytic histidines. An alternative way to avoid the movement of the catalytic group, which nature seems to have evolved, is the use of a distorted hydrogen bonding of the general acid-base catalytic group to the nucleophilic groups. Wang (1970) proposed the concept of the distorted but precisely directed hydrogen bonding in the catalytic groups of the enzyme. Storm & Koshland (1970) also proposed the so called orbital steering model of the enzymic catalysis stressing the importance of a precise coordination of the catalytic groups and substrate. The hydrogen bonds of Ser-195 and the iigand water to His-57 distorted in a symmetric manner appear to fulfill such a condition of precise co-ordination. According to an analysis by Bender et al. (1964) the so-called proximity effect (Koshland, 1962; Bruice, 1970) and the use of an alchoxide anion nucleophile suffices to explain the rate enhancement in the cc-chymotrypsin catalysis and no enhancement in the general acid-base catalytic power of the functional histidine more than usual imidazole is necessary. However, the distorted hydrogen bond of His-57 to the ligand water much depresses the general acid-base catalytic power of His-57 in the stage of the nucleophilic attack of the water to the acylenzyme if no assistance of Asp-102 is present. The assistance of Asp-102 to His-57 is essential to recover the catalytic power of His-57 to the usual level of imidazole. The efficiency of the proton abstraction from Ser-195 in the charge relay system, on the other hand, is much better than that of the proton abstraction from the fixed water in spite of the hydrogen bond of Ser-195 to His-57 distorted in a similar way to that of the fixed water to His-57. Therefore, the charge relay system will work as a rate accelerating machinery in the stage of the nucleophilic attack of Ser-195 to the substrate. This interpretation seems to offer a consistent solution for the dilemma stated in introduction. The present results are also consistent with the observations for the c1chymotrypsin with methylated His-57 (Henderson, 1971). Methylated rx-chymotrypsin (Me-CT) has an enzymic activity largely depressed than the

native one (by the factor 5 x.103 to 2 x 10'). Its X-ray study suggested tha the methylated His-57 flipped its imidazole plane and the unmethylated Nd' emerged at the surface of the enzyme (Wright, Hess & Blow, 1972). This is consistent with the observed pK, of about 7 in the pH-rate protie of Me-CT. Since Ndl of the flipped His-57 is capable of forming a linear hydrogen bond to water molecule without the steric hindrance of Ser-195 and no basic assistance of Asp-102 is possible, the observed pK, should represent the normal pK, of imidazole. However, the distance between the functional Nd' of methylated His-57 and 0' of Ser-195 becomes longer than that in the native enzyme and the precise orientation of the hydrogen bonding, which is considered necessary for a smooth stereochemical flow in the catalysis, is lost. This seems to be the reason why a drastic depression in the catalytic rate of the Me-CT arises. The present calculations have indicated that the hydrogen bonds of the peptide group of His-57 and the hydroxyl group of Ser-214 to Asp-102 somewhat weaken the power of Asp-102 in the basic assistance to His-57, which is the effect unfavorable to the catalysis, but no other conspicuous effect has been obtained. So, it seems likely that they have no direct positive significance in the catalysis but their main role is to fix Asp-102 at the position suitable for the hydrogen bonding to His-57. Recently, Umeyama, Imamura, Nagata & Hanano (1973) published a paper on CNDO/2 calculation on a-chymotrypsin catalysis, which involved not only the catalytic groups but also a substrate. They showed that a large decrease in the activation energy was obtained in the catalysis by the charge relay system compared to the ones by an imidazole and a water. They concluded that the decrease of the activation energy was mainly due to a large gain in the delocalization energy in the enzymic catalysis. Their result is very interesting and indicative of the presence of purely electronic mechanism for acceleration of enzymic catalysis. However, due to the well known defect in the CND0/2 method in the process involving formation and breaking of covalent bonds, the value of the activation energy calculated by the CND0/2 method has little quantitative significance relevant to observations, although it might correctly reflect a qualitative tendency. Therefore, it is unfortunately impossible to estimate quantitatively the rate enhancement by the gain in delocalization energy and to evaluate its importance in enzymic catalysis. We restricted our calculation only for the proton transfer processes in hydrogen bonding system for which the CND0/2 method has been known to give a good result well correlated to observations if a suitable resealing in energy is done. Hence, our calculations with a semi-empirical technique to adjust the calculated proton transfer energy to the observed pK, seems to have at least a semi-quantitative reliability. 2 T.B.
