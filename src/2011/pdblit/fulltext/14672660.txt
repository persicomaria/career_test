Abstract A limited number of proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been characterized so far for their use as potential candidates for diagnosis and vaccine studies. This study was aimed at cloning, expression, and puriWcation of a 27 kDa protein (otherwise known as the MPT51 or Rv3803c protein) of M. tuberculosis. The Rv3803c gene was PCR ampliWed using primers that contain speciWc restriction sites. The ampliWed product was inserted initially into pTOPO and then sub-cloned into pET15b and pET24d vectors, such that the recombinant protein is predicted to contain an N-terminal or a C-terminal histidine tag, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the recombinant proteins were puriWed from the cytosolic fractions of the E. coli sonicates by nickel­NTA chromatography. The purity, molecular mass, and the conformation of the proteins were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), matrix assisted laser desorption­ionization-time-of-Xight (MALDI-TOF), and circular dichroism (CD) studies, respectively. The puriWed proteins were found to be immunogenic and useful for immunodiagnostic studies of tuberculosis by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a sensitivity of 71% and speciWcity of 95%.  2004 Elsevier Inc.

Proteins released by Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the extra-cellular environment are the focus of many research studies, to identify antigens that induce protective immunity or those that elicit immune responses of diagnostic value [1]. Although the genome of M. tuberculosis has been deciphered, more than 60% of the encoded proteins are not yet characterized [2]. The 27 kDa protein or MPT51 (RV3803c) is known to exhibit more than 60% sequence similarity in its Nterminal region with the antigen 85 complex proteins [3]. Earlier studies [4] have identiWed epitopes common to this protein and the proteins of the antigen 85 complex. A comparison of the coding regions shows that the mycobacterial antigen 85A and 85B genes are more

related to each other than to the antigen 85C gene, and that the MPT51 gene is the most divergent member of this family. Despite the close proximity of the mycobacterial MPT51 gene to the 85A gene on the M. tuberculosis chromosome, which would suggest a recent evolutionary duplication event, the predicted MPT51 protein is structurally not particularly related to 85A molecules and in fact resembles 85B and 85C proteins equally. However, the structural divergence of the MPT51 protein, which probably accounts for a diVerent biological function in the mycobacterial cell, remains to be further elucidated [5]. The presence of MPT51-speciWc epitopes, not found in other members of the Ag85 complex, has been shown by studies with monoclonal antibodies that were developed for this antigen by Rambukkana et al. [6]. However, not much work has been done on the immunological characterization of this antigen. In preliminary

studies, using immunoblotting, the 27 kDa protein was found to be recognized by pooled patients' sera and not by pooled control sera, suggesting that it is immunogenic in humans upon infection. As the native protein is diYcult to produce in large amounts, we describe here the expression of the Rv3803c gene in Escherichia coli, the puriWcation and biophysical characterization of the recombinant 27 kDa protein, to be able to evaluate this antigen for its potential as an immunodiagnostic reagent.

PuriWcation of the recombinant proteins The induced E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were suspended in lysis buVer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; and 10 mM imidazole) supplemented with 1 tablet/25 ml protease inhibitors [complete TM, EDTA free (Roche Chemicals, Germany)] and 25 l of DNase of 10 mg/ml (Sigma Chemical, USA). The cells were subjected to three passages through a French pressure cell, at a pressure of 1000 psi, to obtain a clear lysate. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by 30% trichloroacetic acid and 20 mM deoxycholic acid sodium salt. The precipitate was centrifuged and resuspended in 1£ Laemmli buVer [7] and titrated against Tris­HCl (pH 8.8) to neutralize the acidic nature of the sample. The pellet was washed with 750 l of 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.6), centrifuged, and resuspended in 500 l of 1% SDS. Both the supernatant and the pellet were analyzed by SDS­ PAGE using a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel. The supernatant of the cell lysate was passed through the nickel­NTA column (Chelating Sepharose, Fast Xow, with Ni2+ metal coupled, Amersham­Pharmacia) at a Xow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The unbound material was washed with buVer A (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; and 10 mM imidazole) until the OD reached the baseline. Elution of the bound histidinetagged protein was carried out with 60 ml buVer B (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; and 50 mM imidazole). The eluates were collected as 2 ml fractions. When the absorbance reached baseline again, a second elution was carried out with a higher concentration of imidazole (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0; 300 mM NaCl; and 250 mM imidazole). The samples obtained were then analyzed by SDS­PAGE using a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and the fractions containing MPT51 were pooled and dialyzed overnight against PBS at 4 °C. Protein determination The protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Kit (Pierce, USA). HPLC studies Approximately 100 g of the puriWed proteins (either N-terminally or C-terminally histidine tagged) was dissolved in 0.05% triXuoroacetic acid (TFA, BuVer A) and applied onto a Reverse Phase Column (15RPC ST 4.6/100, Pharmacia) operated in AKTA design system (Amersham Pharmacia) at a Xow rate of 0.1 ml/ min. After washing with 0.05% TFA, the protein was eluted with an increasing linear gradient of 80% isopropanol in 0.05% TFA (BuVer B). During the entire run the chromatogram was analyzed by UNICORN V3.20 software.

Materials and methods PCR cloning The Rv3803c gene was ampliWed using 2 sets of primers bearing diVerent restriction sites for the construction of pET15b and pET24d. The sequences of the forward and reverse primers for pET15b were 5 -GGA TCC TCG CAT CGG CAC CTG GCT TAG C-3 and 5 -CCC CAT ATG GAG AAC CTG ATG GTG CC-3 bearing BamHI and NdeI restriction sites (underlined in bold), respectively. For pET24d, the forward primer had the sequence 5 CTC GAG CGC ACC GAC GAT ATC ACC CGA CA3 and the reverse primer had the sequence 5 -CCA TGG CCC CAT ACG AGA ACC TGA TG-3 with XhoI and NcoI sites (underlined in bold), respectively. The PCR consisted of a denaturation step at 94 °C for 30 s, an annealing step at 58 °C for 30 s, and extension steps at 72 °C for 1 min performed for 36 cycles. The ampliWed 824- and 803-bp products were inserted into pCR 2.1-TOPO, and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli (XL1-Blue). The inserts from the obtained clones were sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI Prism, USA), and the fragments without mutations, named pCR 2.1-53.2 and pCR 2.1104.2.1, were inserted into the pET15b and pET24d, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were then introduced into E. coli BL21 by electroporation, and selected on LB agarose plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 g/ml) and kanamycin (25 g/ml) for the selection of pET15b- and pET24d derivatives, respectively. Expression studies The obtained plasmids, named pRAMN and pRAMC, were further introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression studies. The transformed E. coli cells were grown in 500 ml terriWc broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 g/ml) or kanamycin (25 g/ml) for pRAMN or pRAMC, respectively. When the OD600 had reached 0.8, expression was induced by the addition of 1 mM Isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 h at 37 °C. The induced cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min at 4 °C. Pellets of both the cultures weighed around 3.890 g.

Matrix assisted laser desorption­ionization-time-of-Xight The protein samples were desalted using a C18 ZipTip column (Millipore, USA) and prepared for mass spectrometry. Approximately 1 pmol of the puriWed proteins was mixed with freshly dissolved sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA), spotted onto the sample plate, and air-dried. The samples were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption­ionizationtime-of-Xight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using Voyager-DE-STR (Applied Biosystems, Palo Alto, USA). Mass spectra were obtained in the delayed extraction, positive ion, and linear mode with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The parameters were set as follows: grid, % 92; delay, 750 ns; and low mass gate, 1000 atomic mass units (amu). The instrument was calibrated externally with carbonic anhydrase and bovine serum albumin. Further, mass-Wngerprinting analysis was carried out for the proteins after subjecting them to trypsin digestion. BrieXy, 100 g of lyophilized protein was resuspended in 20 l of 10 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.4) and 3 l trypsin (Promega, seq. grade, 5000 U/mg) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digested peptides were desalted using a ZipTip column. The peptides were then mixed with freshly dissolved -cyano-4-hydroxycinnaminic acid (5 mg/ml in 50% CH3CN, 0.1% TFA), spotted onto the plate, and allowed to dry. Mass spectra were obtained in the delayed extraction, positive ion, reXection mode, with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The parameters were set as follows: grid, % 61; delay, 90 ns; and low mass gate, 500 amu, to obtain the best resolution in the mass range (typically 110,000). The laser required to desorb and ionize the samples was kept at the lowest value compatible with a signal/noise ratio 150. The instrument was calibrated externally using the MH+ monoisotopic ions from several peptides (angiotensin, 1296.685; ACTH clip 1-17, 2093.087; ACTH clip 18-39, 2465.199). Circular dichroism studies The circular dichroism (CD) measurement was carried out on a spectropolarimeter (JASCO-715, Japan) using a 0.1 cm cell at 0.2 nm intervals with 3 scans averaged for each. CD spectra were recorded in the 200­ 250 nm range. The mean residue ellipticity ( ) is given in units of degree cm2 dmol¡1. The CD spectrum was recorded for both forms (N- and C-terminally histidinetagged) of the puriWed recombinant 27-kDa protein (1 £ 10¡5 M) at pH 7.0. Immunoblotting Immunoblot analyses were carried out following the procedures described earlier [8]. BrieXy, after electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in transfer buVer (0.025 M

Tris­HCl, pH 8.3, containing 0.192 M glycine, and 20% methanol) for 30 min and electro-transfer onto Nitrocellulose paper (NCP) (0.45 m pore size) was carried out by the method of Towbin et al. [9], using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad, USA) at 0.65 A for 1 h. Reactive sites of the NCP were blocked by incubating with 5% skimmed milk powder in PBS with 0.3% Tween 20 (PBST). After washing, strips were cut and incubated overnight at 4 °C with sera from immunized rabbits (1/100). Antibodies were detected with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins at a dilution of 1:1000 (Dakopatts, Denmark). After repeated washes with PBST, the strips were developed using diamino benzidine (DAB). Study population Blood was obtained from smear- and culture-positive tuberculosis patients, prior to treatment (S+C+, TB) (N D 175) and normal healthy subjects (NHS) (N D 150). The sera were separated and stored at ¡70 °C until further use. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay IgG and IgA levels against the recombinant 27-kDa antigen were estimated in the sera from TB and NHS as described [10]. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates (Nunc Maxisorp CertiWed, Xat bottom) were coated with an optimal concentration of 5 g/ml 27 kDa protein. The sera were tested at 1:200 dilutions, as determined in prior standardization experiments. Anti-human IgG- and IgA-peroxidase conjugates (Jackson Laboratories, USA) were used at 1:1000 (for IgG) or 1:500 (for IgA) dilutions in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) containing 1% BSA. Design and analysis The sera to be analyzed were coded, randomly allocated to diVerent wells within the plate, and tested in a blinded manner. After decoding, the mean absorbance (OD) and standard deviation (SD) of the NHS were calculated. Mean OD + 2 SD of NHS was considered as the cut-oV value. Any sample exhibiting absorbance above the cut-oV value was considered as positive.

Results Expression of rv3803c in E. coli The ampliWed 824- and 803-bp PCR products encoding MPT51 (RV3803c) with the N-terminal and the Cterminal His tag, respectively, were initially inserted into pCR 2.1-TOPO. The clones were veriWed by restriction

analysis for the inserts, and the DNA sequence of the ampliWed rv3803c gene was determined to conWrm the identity of the cloned genes and to verify that no mutation was introduced by the PCR step. The fragments without mutations, named TOPO 53.2 and TOPO 104.2, were then inserted into pET15b and pET24d, to yield pRAMN and pRAMC, respectively, which were then introduced into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. SDS­PAGE analysis of the recombinant clones containing either one of the two plasmids (pRAMN or pRAMC) indicated high levels of production of the recombinant proteins after induction with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 37 °C (Fig. 1). The recombinant proteins were found to be soluble, since they were detected in the cytosolic, soluble fractions of the E. coli sonicate (Fig. 2). PuriWcation The cytosol fractions of the induced E. coli strains were subjected to nickel­NTA chromatography. The recombinant proteins were eluted with 50 mM imidazole, as evidenced by SDS­PAGE of the eluted fractions (Fig. 3). After pooling the MPT51-containing fractions and dialysis to remove the imidazole, the total yields of the puriWed proteins were estimated to be 30 mg for N-terminally His-tagged protein and 45 mg for the Cterminally His-tagged protein/0.5 liter of the respective recombinant E. coli culture (wet weight of pellets around 3.890 g). Biophysical analyses of the recombinant proteins Both puriWed recombinant proteins were subjected to HPLC analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, a single peak was obtained with the same retention time for both the N-terminally and the C-terminally histidine-tagged

proteins, which conWrms the homogeneity and the similarity of these two recombinant proteins. MALDI-TOF was used to determine the molecular mass of the puriWed proteins. The N-terminally Histagged protein was found to have a molecular mass of 29648.28 Da, and the C-terminally His-tagged protein had a mass of 28740.42 Da. Peptide mass-Wngerprinting analyses were carried out by subjecting the proteins to trypsin digestion. The monoisotopic masses obtained for the individual peptides were in the range of 1021.456­ 4570.101 (Fig. 5). The sequences of the digested peptides showed coverage of 70% and were matched with the protein sequences in the database using the PROFOUND software. This analysis identiWed both recombinant proteins as His-tagged derivatives of MPT51 (RV3803c). The CD spectra obtained for both recombinant forms of MPT51 showed a characteristic -sheet structure by exhibiting a single absorption peak at 218 nm (Fig. 6). The mean residue ellipticity ( ) value obtained was ¡1.31E + 007 and ¡1.37E + 007 for the N-terminally and the C-terminally histidine-tagged proteins, respectively. Immunogenicity of the antigen Antibody response in animals To conWrm the immunogenicity of the recombinant proteins, rabbits were immunized with the proteins. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the recombinant 27 kDa protein (27 kDa C-terminal His tagged) in rabbits by subcutaneous injection of the antigen emulsiWed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) at multiple sites on the dorsal side. The antibody obtained against the 27 kDa protein after each immunization (3 immunizations), including that of the pre-immune

to recognize the native 27 kDa protein present in the culture Wltrate, along with the antigen 85 complex proteins, which share homology with the 27 kDa antigen. Antibody response in human tuberculosis As shown in Table 1, 124 out of the 175 S+C+ TB sera and 8 out of the 150 control sera were positive for anti-MPT51-IgG and/or IgA, oVering a test with 71% sensitivity and 95% speciWcity. Hence, this antigen can be used, along with the existing panel of antigens, to improve the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

Discussion The identiWcation and characterization of antigenic proteins are essential for the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of mycobacteria and the immune response against them. In addition, the availability of the puriWed proteins helps us to complement the existing panel of antigens for diagnosis and/or sub-unit vaccines. Immunological studies of the puriWed proteins can also pave the way for exploring the possible function of these proteins within the host, as well as the host response directed towards similar proteins. Earlier attempts made to purify native MPT51 in our laboratory, by various conventional biochemical procedures like anion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and whole gel elution techniques, have met with very limited success and the protein could not be puriWed to homogeneity. This was mainly due to the contamination with the homologous proteins, such as the antigen 85 complex proteins that have properties very similar to those of MPT51. Moreover, the yield of MPT51 after puriWcation was also very low and was not

When the pre- and post-immunization rabbit antisera were tested against the recombinant 27 kDa protein, prominent bands were detected after immunization conWrming the immunogenicity of the recombinant antigen (Fig. 7). In addition, when the antibodies produced against the recombinant 27 kDa were used to probe the whole culture Wltrate of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, they were found

suYcient to be used for immunological characterization studies. Therefore, it was necessary to over-express this protein in a recombinant form in E. coli.

For over-expression of MPT51, the pET expression system was used. The expression vectors were chosen based on the presence of sequences encoding six histidine residues either 5 or 3 of the multiple cloning site (MCS). Both the vectors were used for expression, since

the position of the histidine tags can inXuence the level of expression of the protein [11]. High level of expression could be achieved only with 1 mM IPTG and 4 h of induction at 37 °C. Moreover, optimal expression of this protein was achieved when terriWc broth instead of LB medium was used. Densitometric analysis of the Coomassie blue-stained gels revealed that the recombinant proteins constituted approximately 30% of the total cell protein. Furthermore, the high content of this protein in the bacterial cells did not result in protein aggregation into insoluble inclusion bodies or any detectable lysis of the producing cells. Cell fractionation analysis carried out on the E. coli lysates showed the presence of this antigen in the cytosolic fraction and not in the pellet. Hence, it could be puriWed in its native, non-denatured form. After puriWcation, the total yield of the pRAMN-encoded protein was 30 mg from 500 ml of culture, and that of the pRAMCencoded protein was 45 mg for 500 ml culture. No excision of the tags was performed before the characterization of the recombinant protein. HPLC studies conWrmed the purity of the recombinant proteins, by exhibiting a single peak read at both 260 and 280 nm. The retention time of the run was identical for both recombinant proteins. Thus, the protein isolated by a single step using nickel­NTA chromatography was homogeneous. MALDI-TOF studies revealed the approximative molecular mass of the recombinant proteins, which was in accordance with the theoretical mass prediction of the proteins. The 27 kDa protein contains 266 amino acids (aa). The N-terminal His-tagged form contains 284 aa and the C-terminal His-tagged form 273 aa. There are additional residues in between the N-terminal His tag and the protein, which is a thrombin site, which facilitates the cleavage of the His tag, if needed. Therefore, the diVerence in the mass between both the forms of the protein is due to the number of total amino acids. The measured molecular mass for the recombinant protein with the N-terminal His tag (284 aa) was 29648.28 Da (theoretical mass D 29772.09). The diVerence observed between the theoretical and measured mass could be due to the loss of the Wrst methionine (mol. wt. 123.8) as it can be observed in bacteria [12]. No such degradation could be observed for the C-terminal His tag (273 aa). The measured molecular mass was 28740.42 Da and was

very close to the theoretical mass (28735.92), suggesting its integrity. Mass-Wngerprinting analysis of the protein, carried out by the trypsin digestion, provided amino acid sequences that conWrmed that the recombinant proteins were indeed MPT51 derivatives. CD studies revealed the predominant -sheet structure by exhibiting a characteristic peak at 218 nm. Both the recombinant forms of the protein showed the same pattern. Thus, the position of the histidine tags did not alter the global conformation of the protein. The puriWed recombinant proteins were found to be immunogenic in rabbits and induced the production of polyclonal antibodies. The proteins were also able to react with circulating human antibodies present in the sera of tuberculosis patients. The antigen oVered a sensitivity of 71% and a speciWcity of 95%. The existing tests with puriWed single antigens such as 38, 30, and 16 kDa show a sensitivity of 60­70% [10,13,14]. This is the limit of sensitivity obtainable with single antigens, since antibody response depends on the host genetic factors and the quantity and targets of response vary from individual to individual. A combination of tests using several antigens has been recommended in the literature, in view of the large individual variation in serological response. Hence, the 27 kDa antigen can be used, along with the existing panel of antigens, to improve the diagnosis of tuberculosis. In summary, we have obtained E. coli strains overproducing M. tuberculosis MPT51 (60­90 mg/liter of bacterial culture). The over-expressed MPT51 exists as a soluble protein and could thus be puriWed under native conditions and was found to be immunologically active. HPLC, MALDI-TOF, and circular dichroism studies were helpful in identifying the purity, molecular mass, and the conformation of the protein. The recombinant proteins were found to be immunogenic and useful for the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis when evaluated by ELISA, with a sensitivity of 71% and a speciWcity of 95%.
