INTRODUCTION The TM0067 gene of Thermotoga maritima encodes a 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase (EC 2.7.1.45) with a molecular weight of 37,601 Da and a calculated isoelectric point of 5.89. 2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase phosphorylates 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate to 2-keto-3-deoxy-Dgluconate-6-phosphate, with simultaneous hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, and occupies a central position in the pectin, galacturonate, and xylan catabolic pathways.1 TM0067 belongs to the family of pfkB kinases (Pfam PF00294),2 which includes a variety of carbohydrate and pyrimidine kinases, such as phosphomethylpyrimidine kinase. Here, we report the crystal structure of TM0067 that was determined using the semiautomated, highthroughput pipeline of the Joint Center for Structural Genomics (JCSG),3 which is part of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences' (NIGMS) Protein Structure Initiative (PSI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein production and crystallization

The gene encoding TM0067 (TIGR: TM0067; SwissProt: Q9WXS2) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from genomic DNA using PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers corresponding to the predicted 50 and 30 ends. The PCR product was cloned into plasmid pMH1, which encodes an expression and purification tag (MGSDKIHHHHHH) at the aminoterminus of the full-length protein. The cloning junctions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Protein expression

was performed in a selenomethionine-containing medium using the Escherichia coli methionine auxotrophic strain DL41. At the end of fermentation, lysozyme was added to the culture to a final concentration of 1 mg/ mL, and the cells were harvested. After one freeze/thaw cycle, the cells were sonicated in Lysis Buffer [50 mM Tris pH 7.9, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP)], and the lysate was centrifuged at 3400 3 g for 60 min. The soluble fraction was applied to nickel-chelating resin (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with Equilibration Buffer [50 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8, 300 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP] containing 20 mM imidazole, the resin was washed with Equilibration Buffer containing 44 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted with Elution Buffer [20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 300 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP]. The eluate was buffer exchanged with Buffer Q [20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25 mM TCEP] containing 50 mM NaCl and applied to a RESOURCE Q column (GE Healthcare) preequilibrated with the same buffer. TM0067 was eluted using a linear gradient of 50≠500 mM NaCl in Buffer Q, buffer exchanged with Crystallization Buffer [20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM TCEP], and concentrated

for crystallization assays to 15 mg/mL by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Millipore). The protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method4 with standard JCSG crystallization protocols.3 The crystallization reagent contained 50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 200 and 0.1 M Tris pH 6.8. The crystals were indexed in trigonal space group R32 (Table I). Molecular weight and oligomeric state of TM0067 were determined using a 1 cm 3 30 cm Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in combination with static light scattering (Wyatt Technology). The mobile phase consisted of 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide.
Data collection, structure solution, and refinement

Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beamline 9≠2 at wavelengths corresponding to the inflection point (k1), the high energy remote (k2), and the peak (k3) of a selenium MAD experiment using the BLU-ICE7 data collection environment (Table I). All data sets were collected at 100 K using a Quantum 4 CCD detector. Data were integrated

and reduced using Mosflm8 and then scaled with the program SCALA from the CCP4 suite.5 The initial struc∞ ture was determined with the 2.2 A selenium MAD data (k1,2,3), using the CCP4 suite5 and SOLVE/RESOLVE,9 ∞ and then refined to 2.05 A resolution. Model building and refinement were performed using O10 and REFMAC5.5 Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.
Validation and deposition

Analysis of the stereochemical quality of the model was accomplished using AutoDepInputTool,11 MolProbity,12 SFcheck 4.0,13 and WHATIF 5.0.14 Protein quaternary structure analysis was performed using the PQS server.15 Figures were prepared with PyMOL (DeLano Scientific). Atomic coordinates and experimental struc∞ ture factors for TM0067 at 2.05 A resolution have been deposited in the PDB and are accessible under the code 2afb.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION ∞ The structure of TM0067 was determined to 2.05 A resolution using the MAD method. Data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The final model includes two TM0067 molecules (monomer A: residues 24 to 209 and 217≠331; monomer B: residues 0≠210 and 217≠331), six nickel ions, four calcium ions, and 394 water molecules in the asymmetric unit. Residues 0 to 24 represent the ordered His-tag residues. The remaining residues [211 to 25 (expression and purification tag), 210≠216, and 332≠339 from monomer A; 211 to 21, 211≠216, and 332≠339 from monomer B] were disordered and were not modeled. The Matthews' ∞ coefficient (Vm)16 for TM0067 is 2.35 A3/Da, and the estimated solvent content is 47.2%. The Ramachandran plot produced by MolProbity12 shows that 98.6% and 100.0% of the residues are in favored and allowed regions, respectively. The TM0067 monomer consists of 339 amino acids and is composed of 14 helices (10 a-helices and four 310helices) and 14 b-strands [Fig. 1(A,B)]. The total a-helical, 310-helical, and b-strand content is 36.6, 5.3, and 26.5%, respectively. The 14 b-strands form two mixedtype b-sheets (A and B). b-Sheet A contains 10 strands with 321456789(10) topology, where b14 is an extension of b13, and forms a highly curved layer surrounded by 13 helices. b-Sheet B contains four b-strands with 2134 topology. The TM0067 protein possesses three different structural domains (I≠III) [Fig. 1(A)]. Domain I contains residues 1≠108, domain II encompasses residues 109≠189, and domain III is located between residues 190 and 339. Domains I and II are involved in ATP binding and domain III in substrate binding (by homology to E. coli

ribokinase). The carboxylate of Asp280 in domain III might serve as the catalytic base. TM0067 belongs to the class of alpha and beta proteins (a/b) and contains a ribokinase-like fold. Thirtyfive structures (including TM0067) in the PDB belong to the ribokinase-like family of pre-SCOP (updated on June 4, 2007); interestingly, four different T. maritima proteins are represented. A structural similarity search performed with the program DALI,17 using the coordinates of TM0067 as a query, indicates that the most similar structure is 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase from Thermus thermophilus (PDB: 1v19).18 Both proteins can be struc∞ turally aligned with an RMSD of 2.3 A and a sequence identity of 29% over 277 Ca atoms [Fig. 2(A)]. The second most similar hit is ribokinase (PDB: 1rkd) from E. coli.19 The RMSD between TM0067 and ribokinase is ∞ 2.7 A over 289 Ca atoms with 21% sequence identity. The active site, as indicated by the bound 2-keto-3deoxygluconate (KDG) molecule in the T. thermophilus enzyme,18 appears to be highly conserved between the two 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinases [Fig. 2(B)]. Even though all members of the family of pfkB kinases share important common features, such as the location of the substrate-binding site and the catalytic base, they show significant differences in the detailed structure of the substrate-binding site. The most favored catalytic base is aspartic acid, which is present in a conserved GAGD sequence motif. However, B. subtilis thiazole kinase and S. typhimurium phosphate kinase20 employ cysteine as their catalytic base. Differences are also observed in the nucleotide-binding site, where the residues coordinating the adenine moiety of ATP appear to be less well conserved. In fact, the pocket for the adenine moiety in TM0067 is occupied by the side chain of Trp252. However, the catalytic residues coordinating the phosphate groups are well conserved, and it can be concluded that the reaction and mechanism of catalysis are very similar. The proposed reaction is initiated by the deprotonation of the hydroxyl group of the substrate by the catalytic base (Asp280 in TM0067). A nucleophilic attack on the g-phosphate of ATP by the negatively charged hydroxyl group generates the transition state intermediate. In contrast to the stabilization of the reaction center of the T. thermophilus enzyme by two positive side chains (Lys219 and Arg167), the reaction center of the T. maritima protein shows conservation of the arginine side chain (Arg168) only. The lysine residue is replaced by a threonine (Thr240) in the TM0067 structure. A nine-residue insertion between Arg242 and Trp252 in the T. maritima structure (between Gly221 and Ala222 in the T. thermophilus structure) makes the adenine-binding site less solvent accessible. Two hydrogen bonds between this insert region and Ser95 from the flap region comprising ∞ b-sheet B and helix H1 [Thr248Og¡¡¡Ser95N (2.72 A) ∞ )] seem to stabilize this and Ala247N¡¡¡Ser95O (2.92 A conformation. Therefore, the activity of the T. maritima

confirmation of this postulate. It is noteworthy that this insert region points toward the solvent in the hexameric structure.

The crystallographic packing suggests that a hexamer is the biologically relevant oligomer of TM0067, which is consistent with results from analytical size exclusion chromatography in combination with static light scattering [Fig. 2(C)]. The hexamer is stabilized by four interchain salt bridges between every pair of contacting ∞ monomers and buries 2640 A2 of surface area per monomer. Other structures in this fold family are monomeric (adenosine kinase),21 dimeric (ribokinase),19 or trimeric (thiazole kinase).22 More than 1000 homologs belonging to this protein family have been identified in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Homology structural models of all these homologs can be accessed at http://www1.jcsg.org/cgi-bin/ models/get_mor.pl?key5TM0067. The TM0067 crystal structure reported here represents the second 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase structure (n.b. both structures are from thermophilic bacteria). The information presented here, in combination with further biochemical and biophysical studies, should yield valuable insights into the modulation of the crucial pectin, galacturonate, and xylan catabolic pathways.
