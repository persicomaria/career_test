Abstract: We have recently introduced a basic concept for the combined chemical and enzymatic preparation of site-specifically modified 2-methylseleno RNAs which represent useful derivatives for phasing of X-ray crystallographic data during their three-dimensional structure determination. Here, we introduce the first synthesis of an appropriate guanosine phosphoramidite, which complements the thus far established set of 2-methylseleno-modified uridine, cytidine, and adenosine building blocks for solid-phase synthesis. The novel building block was readily incorporated into RNA. Importantly, it was the 2-methylselenoguanosine-labeled RNA that allowed us to reveal the reversible oxidation/reduction behavior of the Se moiety and thus it represents a valuable contribution to the understanding of the action of threo-1,4dimercapto-2,3-butanediol (DTT) required during solid-phase synthesis, deprotection, and crystallization of selenium-containing RNA. In addition, we investigated 2-methylseleno RNA with respect to crystallization properties. Our studies revealed that the Se modification significantly increases the range of conditions leading to crystal growth. Moreover, we determined the crystal structures of model RNA helices and showed that the Se modification can affect crystal packing interactions, thus potentially expanding the possibilities for obtaining the best crystal form.

Introduction

In nucleic acid crystallography, selenium-labeled DNA and RNA oligonucleotides have become recognized recently to represent useful derivatives for convenient phasing of X-ray crystallographic data. Pioneering work by Egli, Huang, and coworkers led to the successful MAD phasing of a short Z-form DNA duplex via phosphoroselenoate backbone modifications and of an A-form DNA duplex via 2-methylseleno uridine modifications.1,2 Then, our laboratory introduced advanced procedures for the preparation of 2-methylseleno-modified RNA, site-specifically labeled at single uridines, cytidines, and adenosines (Figure 1).3,4 Thereby, the application of threo-1,4dimercapto-2,3-butanediol (DTT) during all crucial steps of RNA preparation, including the solid-phase synthesis cycle, was a major breakthrough for the high performance of the Se approach. This led to the preparation of high-purity RNAs with up to a hundred nucleotides containing site-specifically incorporated, multiple Se labels, exemplified by the adenine riboswitch aptamer domain.4,10 Successful applications of the Sederivatized RNAs developed in the course of this project have

determination of the Diels-Alder ribozyme solved by the SAD technique via the corresponding 2-methylseleno pyrimidine derivatives synthesized in our laboratory.4,12 The replacement of natural 2-OH by 2-methylseleno groups does not significantly interfere with the global fold of RNA if the labels are properly positioned. Provided that the 2methylseleno moieties reside in the covariant, double helical regions of the target fold, and provided that the 5- and 3-ends of the RNA comprise the same functional groups (phosphates, triphosphates, cyclophosphates, or hydroxyls) as used to crystallize the native RNA, the crystallization behavior and structure of the selenium-modified RNAs compare well with their nonlabeled counterparts.1,4,13 Nevertheless, sugar moieties of RNA often participate in the formation of intermolecular contacts in the crystal lattice, providing valuable hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions.14 In this sense, it is an absolute requirement to make all four standard nucleosides available as 2-methylseleno building blocks for RNA solid-phase synthesis in order to not encounter any limitation in adequate positioning of the Se labels. Here, we present the first synthesis of a 2methylseleno guanosine phosphoramidite appropriate for RNA solid-phase synthesis and its incorporation into oligoribonucleotides. This phosphoramidite completes the set of four standard RNA nucleoside building blocks with 2-methylseleno groups. In addition, we report on the reversible redox behavior of Secontaining RNA and on the influence of Se modifications on the crystallization and structure of model RNA helices.
Results and Discussion

Synthesis of a 2-Methylseleno Guanosine Phosphoramidite. Our route began with the simultaneous protection of the 3- and 5-hydroxyl groups of commercially available 9-[ -Darabinofuranosyl]guanine 1 using 1,3-dichloro-1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane (TIPDSiCl2). Then, treatment of 3,5-protected 2 with acetic anhydride yielded a mixture of N2,2-O-diacetylated and N2,N2,2-O-triacetylated nucleosides, 3a and 3b. Whereas 3a was readily separated from 3b by column chromatography, 3b resisted isolation in pure form and could only be obtained together with its diacetylated counterpart 3a. A complete separation and individual characterization of di- and triacetylated compounds, however, was achieved after protection of the guanine lactam moiety with a O6-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl group introduced under Mitsunobu conditions,15 resulting in 4a and 4b. Protection of O6 was mandatory since this functional group is known to be reactive toward trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride which was required in a later step of the synthesis. For efficient large-scale synthesis, separation of the di- and triacetylated nucleoside derivatives 4a and 4b was not required. Starting with a mixture of them, the basic aqueous conditions of the subsequent hydrolysis step were optimized to liberate the

arabinose 2-hydroxyl group while retaining the guanine N2 monoacetylated, representing the proper protection for the final nucleoside phosphoramidite at an early stage of the synthesis. Hydrolysis product 5 was then reacted with trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride (Tf-Cl) to furnish nucleoside 6, which was isolated and subsequently substituted (SN2) by sodium methylselenide, producing key diastereoisomer 7 in high yield. Deprotection of the TIPDS moiety and simultaneous release of the O6-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl group proceeded straightforwardly using tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF). Derivative 8 was transformed into the dimethoxytritylated compound 9, which was phosphitylated to achieve the actual 2-methylseleno guanosine phosphoramidite building block 10. We point out that initial attempts to apply O6-(N,N-diphenylcarbamoyl)16 instead of O6-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl protection failed because this group was unstable and partly substituted during treatment with sodium methylselenide. Starting with 9-[ -D-arabinofuranosyl]guanine 1, our route provides phosphoramidite 10 in a 6% overall yield in nine steps with eight chromatographic purifications; in total, 0.8 g of 10 was obtained in the course of this study (Scheme 1). Chemical Synthesis and Deprotection of Se-GuanosineContaining RNA. The preparation of RNA with 2-methylseleno-modified guanosines relies on the 2-O-TOM-methodology for strand assembly,17,18 and on a previously established protocol for the synthesis of RNA with site-specific 2-methylseleno uridine, 2-methylseleno cytidine, and 2-methylseleno adenosine modifications.4 Therein, the solid-phase synthesis cycle is substantially changed from standard RNA synthesis by the insertion of a step treating the oligonucleotide chain on the solid support with threo-1,4-dimercapto-2,3-butanediol (DTT). The repeated exposure of the growing chain to DTT is an absolute requirement for the reliable synthesis of RNAs (>25 nt) containing multiple Se labels (>2).4 Along these lines, the novel phosphoramidite 10 was successfully incorporated into oligoribonucleotides with coupling yields higher than 98%, monitored via the UV-trityl assay. Cleavage from the solid support and deprotection of the 2methylseleno-guanosine-modified RNAs were also performed in the presence of DTT, added in millimolar amounts to the deprotection solutions of CH3NH2 in ethanol/H2O and of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). After deprotection, DTT was removed by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G25 column. RNAs were then purified by anion-exchange chromatography under strong denaturating conditions (6 M urea, 80 °C; Figure 2). The molecular weights of the purified RNAs were confirmed by liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray-ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS). Exemplarily, four RNAs containing single 2methylseleno guanosine labels (11a-14a) were prepared with the sequences listed in Table 1. Sequences 12 and 13 represented self-complementary 12 nt and 16 nt RNAs, each containing two isolated G·A mispairs. The structures of the corresponding unmodified duplexes were previously solved by Leonard et al. in 1994 and by Sundaralingam et al. in 1999 and are therefore considered ideal for verifying the guanosine Se approach.19,20

of 1 min in retention time (Figure 2a). Both peaks were isolated, and LC-ESI-MS analysis revealed the expected molecular weight for the slow-migrating RNA and a molecular weight of 16 mass units higher for the fast-migrating RNA. This observation gave evidence that the 2-methylseleno group had been oxidized to the corresponding 2-methylselenoxide group.21 We further corroborated this hypothesis by the finding that purified 11a was rapidly transformed into 11b by exposure to a solution of 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine/water/acetonitrile containing 2 mM iodine. We were then able to reconvert 11b back into 11a upon treatment with 10 mM DTT in ethanol/water. It is remarkable that both oxidation and reduction proceeded without any side products as detected by HPLC. Moreover, the oxidation reaction seems to proceed under diastereoselective control due to observation of a single-product peak. The reversible redox behavior was also investigated and confirmed for the other Seguanosine-containing sequences, 12-14 (Figure 3). It has been noted in the literature that uniform oxidation of Se-methionine-containing protein crystals to the corresponding selenoxides and selenones results in a higher anomalous signal.22-24 Likewise, the consistent transformation of RNA 2methylseleno groups into their corresponding selenoxides could be beneficial, provided the oxidation was complete, the selenoxide moieties were not structurally perturbing, and the RNA derivatives were stable enough over the period of crystallization and data collection. Our ongoing work is focused on these issues. Crystallization of 2-Methylseleno-Guanosine-Containing RNAs. Virtually identical structures of the Se-modified and nonmodified Diels-Alder ribozymes have proven that Se modification does not affect RNA conformation and does not necessarily change RNA packing in the crystals.12 However, sugars often participate in the crystal packing of RNA and, if placed in contacting regions, 2-methylseleno modifications may

interfere with the formation of crystal To investigate the impact of these modifications on RNA crystallization, we placed 2-methylseleno guanosine residues into the 12 nt and 16 nt RNAs in positions (Figure 4a) which are located close to (12-mers, Figure 4b) or within (16-mers, Figure 4b) the regions of intermolecular crystal contacts.19,20 Since these RNAs form double-stranded helices in the crystal lattice that are packed in a head-to-tail fashion with just a few side-to-side contacts, the effect of Se modification on crystallization should be maximized at least in the 16 nt RNA 13a. Interestingly, both Se-modified RNAs, 12a and 13a, were not crystallized in the conditions published for the nonmodified RNAs,19,20 although control nonmodified RNAs readily produced diffracting crystals. To investigate the ability of the Semodified RNAs to crystallize, we performed a search for crystallization conditions using commercial sparse matrix kits. Both 12 nt and 16 nt Se-modified RNAs along with their nonmodified counterparts were screened using 146 unique conditions at 4 and 20 °C. Remarkably, the Se-modified RNAs 12a and 13a produced crystals with a larger number of solutions than their nonmodified counterparts did (total 17 versus 15 for the 12-mers and 33 versus 24 for the 16-mers). However, this increase was predominantly due to the appearance of thin needle-shaped crystal plates growing from the common center (`RNA flowers')25 for 12a (7 conditions) and a higher number of microcrystals for 13a (26 versus 11). A count of large-shaped crystals was clearly greater for the nonmodified RNAs (3 versus

1 for the 12-mers and 13 versus 7 for the 16-mers). Importantly, successful crystallization conditions for the nonmodified and Se-modified RNAs overlapped only partially (10 for the 12mers and 19 conditions for the 16-mers, respectively). A large number of the Se-modified RNAs was crystallized in new unique conditions. This means that Se modification can be viewed as a new sequence variation of RNA targets to find diffraction-quality crystals. It is not clear, however, if this increase can be explained by the particular placement of selenium atoms or by the lower solubility of the 2-methylselenomodified RNAs. Nevertheless, such behavior of Se-modified RNAs can be paralleled with well-known properties of Se-Metmodified proteins, which sometimes do not produce crystals in the established conditions and require adjustment of crystallization conditions or even new crystallization screenings. Crystal Structure of the 2-Methylseleno-Modified 16 nt RNA. Among many solution conditions suitable for crystallization of the Se-modified RNAs, two, based on lithium sulfate and PEG4000, respectively, yielded large well-diffracting crystals of the 16 nt RNA 13a (see Experimental Section). Remarkably, the nonmodified 16-mer produced only microcrystals in the same conditions. Both "lithium sulfate" and "PEG4000" crystals belonged to the R3 space group (Table 2), originally found in the crystals of the nonmodified RNA.20 The crystals had similar cell unit parameters with a/b dimensions 6.0% and 8.9% longer than those in the original structure, clearly

suggesting possible alterations in the crystal packing. The X-ray structures determined from the lithium sulfate and PEG4000 crystals were virtually identical (rmsd 0.55 Å) and, therefore, only the 2.9 Å lithium sulfate structure is described below. The Se-modified 16 nt RNA 13a was crystallized as a righthanded A-form duplex with two nonadjacent G·A mispairs separated by four Watson-Crick base pairs as described for the nonmodified RNA structure.20 Using all-atom superimposition, the two structures can be superimposed with a rather large rmsd of 1.377 Å due to an almost doubled (8°) end-to-end bending in the Se-modified RNA calculated by CURVES (Figure 5a).26 Characteristic nucleobase interactions of the original duplex, in particular the G(syn)·A+(anti) mispairs, can also be modeled in the Se-modified structure (Figure 5b). Nevertheless, original N6(A)-O6(G) and N1(A)-N7(G) hydrogen bond patterns are not preserved due to longer N1(A)N7(G) distances (4.38 and 3.53 Å). Therefore, in the Semodified RNA both G·A+ mispairs are held by O6(G)-N1(A) hydrogen bonds (2.52 and 2.71 Å) with the potential formation of an O6(G6)-N6(A27) hydrogen bond (2.78 Å). It is worth mentioning that the electron density map for the G·A mispairs (Figure 5b) is slightly worse than the base pairs closer to the RNA tips, suggesting some "breathing" within the structure. Such "breathing" is supported by higher B-factor values in the middle part of the duplex and it may even cause alternate G·A pairing in different molecules of the crystal. The formation of different G·A base pairs at the same sequence position is not that surprising since the conformation of these mismatches is sensitive to various factors.27-32

Intermolecular Contacts in the Crystal Lattice. Our analysis of the crystal contacts revealed that the RNA helices of 13a are packed in the head-to-tail fashion, making a few side-to-side interactions with two neighboring RNA helices. In contrast to the nonmodified RNAs (Figure 5c), the central region of the Se-modified RNAs is not involved in packing interactions (Figure 5d). In addition, two stacked helices (green and gray, Figure 5c) of the nonmodified RNA make side-to-side contacts with the same neighboring helix (blue), while the Se-modified helices do not form such overlapping interactions (Figure 5d, Supporting Information Tables S1 and S2). Another rather noticeable difference between the two types of packing is the orientation of G4 and G20 (red nucleotides on Figure 5c,d). In the nonmodified RNA, these nucleotides face the opposite strand of the neighboring helix, but in the presence of Se modifications (Figure 5e) they are positioned against the same nucleotides. Moreover, three Se atoms from neighboring molecules are located at a close (4.0 Å) distance from each other (Figure 5f). The atoms form an equilateral triangle in the center of the packing interactions, thus placing nine nucleotides from three RNA molecules into close proximity, and therefore directly and significantly contributing toward bringing these RNA helices together. Since these packing interactions are exclusive for the Se-modified RNAs and are characteristic of the crystals grown in rather different conditions with either salt or organic polymer as precipitating agents, we suggest that the 2-methylseleno modification is an important driving force in the packing of RNA helices.

have complemented the set of previously reported 2-methylseleno-modified uridine, cytidine, and adenosine building bocks and continue to establish Se-modified RNA as a powerful tool in RNA X-ray structure analysis. Moreover, our detailed investigations on the redox behavior of 2-methylselenoguanosine-containing RNA shed light on the requirement to expose Se-RNA to DTT during synthesis, deprotection, and crystallization since the presence of DTT reduces selenoxides and therefore guarantees a uniformly labeled RNA. For X-ray structure analysis, we consider RNA with covalent 2-methylseleno groups best applicable for sizes up to about 80 nucleotides. Se-RNA of this dimension can be readily obtained by solid-phase synthesis in combination with enzymatic ligation procedures as shown previously.4 For RNAs up to about 35 nt, the Se approach is in competition with 5-iodo and 5-bromo pyrimidine derivatization.33-39 We render the Se approach superior since all four 2-methylseleno nucleoside phosphor(33) Shui, X.; Peek, M.

amidites are now available, and therefore a great flexibility for adequate positioning within the RNA target is attained. In addition, 5-halogen pyrimidine derivatives are highly photoreactive species.40-42 Inherent radiation damage of 5-halogenmodified nucleic acids during MAD data collection has been reported as a limitation.37 For medium-size RNA (up to 100 nt), the Se approach competes with heavy metal ion derivatization.43-46 Heavy atom search is a time-consuming process which requires soaking of the RNA crystals with dozens of compounds at various concentrations, therefore demanding many reasonably good crystals.

approach finally delivered the key derivative to enable structure determination.12 Despite the similarity between the native and Se-modified Diels-Alder ribozymes, we anticipated that 2methylseleno groups may interfere with RNA crystallization if placed in the regions of the crystal packing interactions. Our crystallization experiments clearly indicate that even in the worst case, when modifications are located in the regions of intermolecular contacts and perturb established crystallization protocols, additional screening may identify many more crystallization conditions. These conditions, however, can produce crystals with the same space group but different crystal packing interactions, necessitating the careful analysis of the crystal isomorphism prior usage of native and selenium data in phase calculations. Nevertheless, the X-ray structures presented here demonstrate that even in the presence of a novel set of packing interactions, possibly driven by 2-methylseleno modifications, overall RNA conformation and even fine structural details are largely preserved. Our crystallization experiments, therefore, suggest a novel role for 2-methylseleno modifications, namely, expanding the search for new crystal forms and potentially even forcing crystallization of former noncrystallizable RNA molecules.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of 2-Methylseleno Guanosine Phosphoramidite (10). General. 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 300 MHz, or Varian Unity 500 MHz instrument. The chemical shifts are reported relative to TMS and referenced to the residual proton signal of the deuterated solvents: CDCl3 (7.26 ppm), d6-DMSO (2.50 ppm) for 1H NMR spectra; CDCl3 (77.0 ppm) or d6-DMSO (39.5 ppm) for 13C NMR spectra. 31P shifts are relative to external 85% phosphoric acid. 1H- and 13C-assignments were based on COSY and HSQC experiments. UV-spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica 60F-254 plates. Flash column chromatography was carried out on silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh). Packing of silica gel columns was performed with 1% Et3N added to the corresponding starting eluent. All reactions were carried out under an Ar atmosphere. 9-[ -DArabinofuranosyl]guanine 1 was obtained from MetkinenOy, Finland. Chemical reagents and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Organic solvents for reactions were dried overnight over freshly activated molecular sieves (4 Å). 9-[3,5-O-(1,1,3,3-Tetraisopropyldisiloxane-1,3-diyl)- -D-arabinofuranosyl]guanine (2). 9-[ -D-Arabinofuranosyl]guanine 1 (4.16 g; 14.7 mmol) was coevaporated with dry pyridine three times and then suspended in DMF (160 mL) and pyridine (14 mL) under an argon atmosphere. After dropwise addition of 1,3-dichloro-1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane (4.86 g, 15.4 mmol), the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h and subsequently precipitated by being poured into ice-water that was vigorously stirred (2.6 L). The crude product was collected on a glass-fritted Buchner funnel and used without ¨ further purification for the next step. For analysis, a small portion of crude product was crystallized from ethanol. Yield: 7.60 g of 2 as white powder (98%).

Solid-Phase Synthesis of 2-Methylseleno Nucleoside Containing RNAs. 2-O-TOM standard nucleoside phosphoramidites and the corresponding CPG supports (1000 Å) were obtained from GlenResearch. All oligoribonucleotides containing 2-methylseleno nucleosides were synthesized on Pharmacia instrumentation (Gene Assembler Plus or Special) following modified DNA/RNA standard methods containing an additional cycle step of treatment with DTT; detritylation (2.0 min): dichloroacetic acid/1,2-dichloroethane (4/96); coupling (3.0 min): phosphoramidites/acetonitrile (0.1 M × 120 µL) were activated by benzylthiotetrazole/acetonitrile (0.35 M × 360 µL); capping (3 × 0.4 min): (A) Ac2O/sym-collidine/acetonitrile (20/30/50), (B) 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine/acetonitrile (0.5 M), A/B ) 1/1; oxidation (1.0 min): I2 (10 mM) in acetonitrile/sym-collidine/H2O (10/1/5); DTT treatment (2.0 min): DTT (100 mM) in ethanol/ H2O (2/3). A readyto-use synthesis method file is documented in ref 4. Solutions of standard amidites, tetrazole solutions, and acetonitrile were dried over activated molecular sieves overnight. Solutions of 2-methylseleno guanosine phosphoramidites were only dried for 4-6 h over activated molecular sieves before consumption. Deprotection and Purification of 2-Methylseleno Nucleoside Containing RNAs. Prior to deprotection and cleavage from the solid support the Se-containing RNAs were treated with DTT in ethanol/ H2O 1/1 (150 mM, 200 µL) for 1-3 h at room temperature. Then, MeNH2 in EtOH (8 M, 0.60 mL), MeNH2 in H2O (40%, 0.60 mL), and DTT in EtOH/H2O 1/1 (2 M, 95 µL; final DTT concentration 150 mM) were added and deprotection was continued for 5-6 h. After the

ARTICLES solution was completely evaporated, tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate (TBAF,3H2O) in THF (1 M, 0.95 mL) was added. The reaction mixture was slowly shaken for at least 12 h at room temperature to remove the 2-O-silyl ethers. The reaction was quenched by the addition of triethylammonium acetate (TEA) (1 M, pH 7.4, 0.95 mL). The volume of the solution was reduced to 1 mL and the solution was loaded on a Amersham HiPrep 26/10 Desalting (2.6 × 10 cm; Sephadex G25). The crude RNA was eluted with H2O and dried. Analysis of crude RNA products after deprotection was performed by anion-exchange chromatography on a Dionex DNAPac100 column (4 × 250 mm) at 80 °C. Flow rate: 1 mL/min; eluant A: 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 M urea; eluant B: 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 M NaClO4, 6 M urea; gradient: 0-60% B in A within 45 min; UV detection at 265 nm. Crude RNA products (trityl-off) were purified on a semipreparative Dionex DNAPac100 column (9 × 250 mm). Flow rate: 2 mL/min; gradient: 5-10% B in A within 20 min. Fractions containing RNA were loaded on a C18 SepPak cartridge (Waters/ Millipore), washed with 0.1-0.2 M (Et3NH)HCO3 and H2O, and eluted with H2O/CH3CN (6/4). RNA fractions were lyophilized. Oxidation of 2-Methylseleno-Modified RNA. Oxidation was carried out by treating 2-methylselenoguanosine-containing oligonucleotides (1.5 nmol) with 2 mM iodine in a solution of H2O/CH3CN/sym-collidine (65/10/1, v/v/v; 150 µL) for 5 min. Before analysis by ion-exchange column chromatography (Figure 3; Dionex DNAPac100, conditions as above), the solution was extracted with CHCl3/amyl alcohol (25/1, v/v; 50 µL) twice to remove excess iodine. Reduction of 2-Methylselenoxide-Modified RNA. Reduction of 2-methylselenoxide containing oligonucleotides was achieved by treatment with DTT in water (1.5 nmol of RNA, 2 mM DTT in 150 µL of H2O) for 5 min. The reaction mixture was directly analyzed by ion-exchange column chromatography (Figure 3; Dionex DNAPac-100, conditions as above). Mass Spectrometry of 2-Methylseleno Guanosine Containing RNAs. All experiments were performed on a Finnigan LCQ Advantage MAX ion trap instrumentation connected to an Amersham Ettan micro LC system. RNAs were analyzed in the negative-ion mode with a potential of -4 kV applied to the spray needle. LC: Sample (250 pmol of RNA dissolved in 20 µL of 20 mM EDTA solution; average injection volume: 10-20 µL); column (Amersham µRPC C2/C18; 2.1 × 100 mm) at 21 °C; flow rate: 100 µL/min; eluant A: 8.6 mM TEA, 100 mM 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol in H2O (pH 8.0); eluant B: methanol; gradient: 0-100% B in A within 30 min; UV detection at 254 nm. RNA Crystallization and Data Collection. For crystallization screening, RNAs (1 mM) were annealed in a buffer containing 50 mM potassium acetate (pH 6.9) and 5 mM MgCl2 at 90 °C for 2 min and quickly cooled on ice. Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method using Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen 2, and Natrix kits (Hampton Research). The RNA and reservoir solutions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio (total volume 2 µL) and incubated at 4 and 20 °C for several days. Nonmodified and Se-modified RNAs were grown in parallel in the same wells. Crystals of dimensions 0.1 mm × 0.1 mm × 0.05 mm from the wells with Crystal Screen #15 solution (1.0 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Na-citrate pH 5.6, 0.5 M (NH4)2SO4) and Crystal Screen #9 solution (30% PEG4000 (w/v), 0.1 M Na-citrate pH 5.6, 0.2 M NH4-aceteate) were frozen in liquid nitrogen without cryoprotection. Native and MAD data were collected at beamline X25 at the Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) from the crystals cooled at 100 K. Structure Determination. X-ray data were processed with HKL2000 (HKL Research, VA) (Table 1). The "PEG4000" structure was determined using MAD selenium data. Heavy atom search and phasing was performed using SHARP,47 including the solvent flattening procedure. Anomalous phasing power at peak was 1.08, and figure of

ARTICLES merit before/after solvent flattening was 0.45/0.87. Electron density maps were calculated using CCP448 up to 3.0 Å resolution limit. The RNA model was built manually using TURBO-FRODO (http:// afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/rubrique113.html) and refined with REFMAC up to 2.9 Å resolution limit using data collected from a similar crystal.49 Alternatively, the structure can be solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP48,50 and the native 16-mer RNA structure as a search model. The best MOLREP solution, however, places the RNA model to the wrong position within an infinite RNA helix. The model has to be shifted along the helical axis using the anomalous Se signal and the interruptions of the RNA backbone as beacons. The noncanonical G6·A27 and A11·G27 pairs were modeled using omit 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps calculated either without these purines or their bases. Due to limited resolution and rather poor quality of the omit maps, we attempted to build all major glycosidic conformations of these residues followed by refinement with REFMAC and analysis of the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. The G(syn)·A+(anti) conformation showed the best refinement statistics and best fit to the maps and was chosen over the second best G(anti)·A+(anti) conformation after analysis and comparison of the electron density maps

The "Li2SO4" structure was solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP and the RNA model from the "PEG4000" structure and refined with REFMAC. Sulfate ions were added to the model based on analysis of 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps. All RNA residues were traced in the maps. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 2H1M).
