Crystal structure of the NK1 fragment of HGF/SF suggests a novel mode for growth factor dimerization and receptor binding
Dimitri Y. Chirgadze1, Jonathan P. Hepple2, Hongjun Zhou3, R. Andrew Byrd3, Tom L. Blundell1 and Ermanno Gherardi2
Although ligand-induced receptor dimerization is a common prerequisite for receptor activation, the mode by which different growth factors bind their receptors and cause them to dimerize varies considerably. Here we report the crystal structure at 2.5 Å resolution of NK1, a receptor-binding fragment and a natural splice variant of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF). NK1 assembles as a homodimer in the asymmetric unit, revealing a novel mode of growth factor dimerization produced by close packing of the N domain of one subunit and the kringle domain of the other, thus bringing the two linkers in close proximity. The structure suggests the presence of a binding site for heparan sulfate chains and a mechanism by which the NK1 dimer may engage two receptor molecules through clusters of amino acids located on each protomer and on opposite surfaces of the homodimer. We also report that short (14-mer) heparin fragments effectively dimerize NK1 in solution, implying that heparan sulfate chains may stabilize the NK1 dimer. These results provide a basis for the agonistic activity of NK1 and have implications for the mechanism of receptor binding of HGF/SF.

HGF/SF is a high-molecular-weight polypeptide growth factor with a domain structure and a proteolytic mechanism of activation similar to those of the blood proteinase precursor plasminogen1. The factor acts through the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the c-MET proto-oncogene2,3 and induces a complex response in target cells that includes stimulation of movement4,5, growth6­8 and morphogenesis9. Genetic experiments in vivo have indicated that HGF/SF is essential for vertebrate development, and mutations at the HGF/SF or MET loci cause abnormal development of the liver10, the placenta10,11 and certain groups of skeletal muscle12. Other experiments suggest important roles of HGF/SF in tissue regeneration13­15 and cancer spreading (reviewed in ref. 16). The inactive HGF/SF precursor comprises an N-terminal (N) domain, homologous to the plasminogen activation peptide, four kringle (K) domains and a C-terminal, catalytically inactive serine proteinase domain (Fig. 1)1. Like plasminogen, the precursor is cleaved at a trypsin-like site (Arg 494­Val 495) located between the fourth K domain and the serine proteinase domain17­19 to give the active molecule (Fig. 1). Both urokinase-type20 and tissue-type21 plasminogen activators, as well as a novel serine proteinase related to factor XII, can convert proHGF/SF in two-chain HGF/SF22. Further proteolytic processing of plasminogen leads to loss of the N-terminal domain, but the corresponding domain is retained in active HGF/SF and plays a critical role in receptor binding17,18,23,24. Two truncated forms of HGF/SF are produced by alternative splicing of the primary transcript; these consist of the N domain and kringle 1 (NK1)25 or the N domain, kringle 1 and kringle 2 (NK2)26,27 (Fig. 1). Both fragments were initially characterized as MET antagonists27,28 but retain significant agonistic activity. Indeed, the phenotype of mice overexpressing NK1 mimics very closely that of mice overexpressing full-length

HGF/SF29,30. These results clearly establish that NK1 contains the primary receptor-binding site of HGF/SF and has the ability to activate the MET receptor in vivo. To understand the mechanism by which NK1 binds and activates the MET receptor, we have determined the crystal structure of the corresponding fragment of HGF/SF at 2.5 Å resolution. NK1 crystallizes as a homodimer with an extensive interprotomer interface, suggesting that this may be the form in which NK1 interacts with its receptor and with heparan sulfate.
Structure determination We have expressed amino acids 28­210 of human HGF/SF, a fragment corresponding to NK1, in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris under the control of the alcohol oxidase 1 (AOX1) promoter and the pheromone leader of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. NK1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21

with cell parameters: a = 53.42 Å, b = 63.56 Å, c = 56.81 Å and  = 96.04°, with two NK1 molecules in the asymmetric unit. An extensive traditional heavy-atom search failed to produce useful derivatives, most likely because of a lack of non-isomorphism. Therefore, we applied a combination of molecular replacement and non-crystallographic symmetry averaging to determine the structure of NK1 at 2.5 Å resolution. The molecular replacement strategy involved the positioning in the cell of two different probes: the NMR structure of the N domain of human HGF/SF31 and the crystal structure of kringle 1 of human plasminogen32, which exhibits 51% sequence identity with the corresponding domain of NK1. The refined model (Fig. 2a,b) consists of 344 residues and 59 water molecules and has a crystallographic R-factor of 24.5% (Rfree of 31.9%). Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the crystallographic data, analysis and refinement. The electron density for residues 28­37 and 210 could not be clearly seen because of a high degree of disorder in these regions. Thus, these residues were omitted from the structure of both molecules. The omission of 22 disordered residues probably contributed to the relatively high Rfree value, although both the value of Rfree and the ratio of Rfree to Rcryst lie within the range of other recently defined structures at the same resolution33. In the Ramachandran plot, 76.5% of residues are in most-favored regions, with 21.8% in the additionally allowed regions, 1.7% in the generously allowed regions and none in disallowed regions. The overall temperature factor of the structure, 41.6 Å2, is in good agreement with the B-factor calculated from the Wilson plot (41.7 Å2).

Three-dimensional structure The structure shows that NK1 assembles as a tightly packed homodimer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal unit cell (Fig. 2a,b), with approximate overall dimensions of 58 × 46 × 64 Å. The two NK1 protomers are related by a non-crystallographic proper two-fold axis. There are close contacts of the N domain of one protomer with the K domain of the other (Fig. 2a,b). The protomers show a high degree of structural similarity; the root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of main chain atoms is ~0.3 Å for residues 38­206. The structure of the NK1 protomer comprises two globular subunits: the N and the K domains, connected by a short linker (Lys 122­Asn 127). The overall structure of the N domain is characterized by three primary elements, the first of which is a central five-stranded -sheet formed by residues 42­46 (1), 59­63 (2), 86­90 (3), 95­99 (4) and 116­121 (5) (the numbering of the strands is the same as in ref. 31). The central sheet is flanked on one side by a two-stranded -sheet formed by residues 48­52 (I) and 108­112 (II) and on the other side by a two-and-a-half turn -helix formed by residues 67­76. The -helix is linked through disulfide bridges with strands 3 and 4 of the central -sheet. The three-dimensional analysis of the crystal structure and NMR structure 31 of the N domain shows equivalent overall folds (Fig. 3a). The r.m.s. deviation of the C atoms corresponding to the central -sheet is <0.4 Å. However, there are regions of the domain, such as the loop corresponding to residues 76­84 that makes contact with the kringle domain of the other protomer (Fig. 2a) and the linker joining the N and the kringle domains, which show much larg73

er deviations, up to 3 Å (Fig. 3a). The linker connecting the N and K domains is six residues in length (Lys 122, Asp 123, Tyr 124, Ile 125, Arg 126 and Asn 127) and starts with a 310-helix from the N-terminus. The linkers of the NK1 protomers, which are well defined in the crystal structure (Fig. 3b), are located in close proximity (Fig. 2a) in the center of the homodimer. Superposition of the K domain of NK1 with others determined by X-ray crystallography, such as kringles 1 and 4 of human plasminogen32,34 and the kringle of bovine prothrombin35, shows that the r.m.s. deviation of the C atom positions is within 0.6 Å. Three disulfide bridges (Cys 128­Cys 206, Cys 149­Cys 189, Cys 177­Cys 201) and an antiparallel two-stranded -sheet (residues 188­190 and 198­200) are found in the kringle domain of NK1 (Fig. 2a) as in other kringle structures.
Packing interaction within and between the NK1 protomers A solvent-accessible area of ~800 Å2 is buried by the interface between the two domains in each protomer. Lys 43 in the N domain makes hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Asp 171 and the carbonyl oxygen of Lys 137 of the K domain (Fig. 4a). There remains a deep groove between the N and K domains (Fig. 4b). The weak interactions observed between the N and K domains are consistent with NMR measurements, which show minimal perturbation of the N domain in the NK1 molecule (R.A.B., unpublished data). A solvent-accessible area of ~2,200 Å2 is buried by the interface between the two NK1 protomers. A summary of the main contact sites between the two molecules (Table 2) suggests that a major role is played by the linker peptide connecting the N
74

and K domains. The side chain of Asn 127 forms hydrogen bonds to the side chain of the corresponding Asn 127 in the other protomer and to the carbonyl oxygen of Arg 126 (Fig. 4c). Additional hydrogen bonds are formed between Thr 83 and Lys 85 in the N domain with Lys 144 and Asp 202, respectively, in the K domain (Fig. 4c). Finally, two sets of hydrophobic interactions further contribute to the packing of the two protomers. The first involves the two pairs of half-cystine residues that form the first disulfide bridge in each K domain (Cys 128­Cys 206); the second involves the linker residue Tyr 124 and the kringle residues Pro 204 and Val 140.
Receptor and heparin binding sites The structure of the NK1 homodimer suggests a distinctive topology for the putative receptor-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis of three positively charged residues in the N domain (Lys 91, Arg 93 and Lys 94) on the loop between strands 3 and 4 greatly decreases receptor signaling24. Similar results have been obtained when residues His 114, Glu 115 and Asp 117, located on the N domain between strands 5/II, were mutated to alanines36. With the exception of Asp 117, these residues form a cluster that may interact directly with the MET receptor (Fig. 5a). A second cluster, located in the K domain, includes residues Glu 159 and Ser 161 of a long surface loop, and residues Glu 195, Arg 197 and Tyr 198, found in the loop connecting the two short -strands (Fig. 5a). These clusters are located on the same face of each protomer and form solvent-accessible regions on opposite sides of the homodimer. Thus, the structure suggests a way in which the

A recent study has suggested that heparin and heparan sulfates are essential for the agonistic activity of NK1 and NK2 in cells in culture37. Deletion of the N domain considerably decreases the binding of HGF/SF to heparin38, and several mutations in the N domain have considerable effect on heparin and/or receptor binding. Specifically, two clusters of positively charged residues appear to play a prominent role in heparin binding (Arg 73/Arg 76) or in heparin and receptor binding (Lys 91/Lys 94)24. Heparin chains of eight units or longer could easily bridge the Arg 73/Arg 76 cluster in one protomer with the Lys 91/Lys 94 cluster on the second (Fig. 5b), thus stabilizing the observed NK1 homodimer. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of NK1 in solution in the absence and in the presence of heparin fragments. In the absence of heparin, NK1 behaves as a monomer (Mr = 25.0 K), whereas in the presence of 14-mer heparin, it is converted to a dimeric species (Mr = 47.2 K) (Fig. 6).
Discussion and conclusions The crystal structure reported here reveals a tightly packed NK1 dimer, held together by both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, involving the short interdomain linker, and several additional contacts between the N and K domains (Table 2 and Fig. 4c). This inter-protomer interface is more extensive than most crystal packing interactions but less extensive than that in nerve growth factor39 dimers, which are stable at high dilution. The N domain of HGF/SF plays a major role in heparin binding, and much interest has recently been directed to the role of heparin and heparan sulfates in HGF/SF activity. In the case of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), it has been known for several years that heparan sulfates are essential for signaling, and the recent determination of the crystal structure of an FGF­heparin

NK1 dimer could engage two receptor molecules. Two extra residues affecting receptor binding and biological activity are Asp 171 and Gln 17336. Their location implies that they might exert this effect through packing of the N and K domains. The mutation of these residues would probably disrupt tertiary and quaternary interactions, so leading to a decrease in receptor binding.

complex has demonstrated a role for heparin in FGF dimerization40. On the surface of NK1 we have observed an elongated region with positively charged residues that seems well fitted to bind heparin (Fig. 5b). It is likely, therefore, that this dimer is stabilized by heparin interactions and corresponds to the one observed in solution in the presence of heparin (Fig. 6). If this is the active form of HGF/SF at the receptor, it is possible that the dimer is further stabilized by cooperative interactions within a heterohexameric receptor­NK1­heparin complex. The structure of the NK1 dimer provides a basis for rationalization of its agonistic activity. Of the 12 residues that are known, from site-directed mutagenesis, to play a role in recep-

tor binding or activation, 10 residues cluster in surface patches on the N and K domains (Fig. 5a). Together these two clusters probably constitute the primary receptor-binding site of NK1, although in full-length HGF/SF, additional contacts must occur to account for the higher activity25,37 and for the result of site-directed mutagenesis17,24. Analysis of the residues in both clusters reveals a majority of charged residues and only one aromatic (Tyr 198) (Fig. 5a). This contrasts with the presence of several large hydrophobic residues in the receptor-binding sites of growth hormone41. In addition to the N domain and kringle 1, full-length HGF/SF contains three additional kringle domains (K2­4) and

the catalytically inactive serine proteinase domain (Fig. 1). The position of these domains cannot be predicted on the basis of the NK1 structure except, to an extent, for kringle 2. The linker between kringles 1 and 2 of HGF/SF is only four amino acids in length (Ser 207, Glu 208, Val 209 and Glu 210), and the first three of these residues are clearly seen in the NK1 structure projecting outward from kringle 1 (Figs 2b, 4a). The constraints imposed by the short length of the linker suggests close interactions between the K1 and K2 in the NK2 fragment of HGF/SF and little or no interactions between K2 and the N domain. This conclusion is now open to experimental validation through the analysis of NMR or crystal structures of NK2.

restrained minimized structure of 23 NMR models (PDB accession code: 2hgf) and the crystal structure of plasminogen kringle 1 (PDB accession code: 1pkr). Prior to the calculation, the probes were edited using the O molecular graphics program47 in the following ways: (i) all residues with long side chains were substituted by alanine in both probes and (ii) residues 31­45 and 124­127 of the N-domain probe were removed, and the atomic B factors of this probe were set to 30 Å2. The rotation function search using the kringle domain probe showed two peaks at the top of the list with signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5 and 0.6, respectively (resolution range 8­3.5 Å was used for the calculation). The output list of possible solutions of the rotation function search using the probe for the N domain did not contain any strong (>0.2 signal-to-noise ratio) peaks. However, analysis of the translation function calculated for each of the rotation function solutions from the list showed that the correct rotation function peaks for the N-domain probe were at the fifth and seventh positions in the list. The N-domain and kringle-domain probes were placed in the crystal cell according to the rotational and translational parameters obtained, yielding the values for correlation coefficient and the R cryst between observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes of 49.7% and 49.2%, respectively (resolution range 20­3.0 Å) (Table 1). The non-crystallographic two-fold relationship between the NK1 protomers in the asymmetric unit was consistent with the results of the self-rotation function. Model refinement and rebuilding. The initial rigid body refinement was carried out using AMoRe. Further refinement and electron density maps were calculated using X-PLOR48 for a resolution range 20­2.5 Å. The first 2Fo - Fc map, calculated using only polyalanine chain (Cys and Gly were left unchanged) of the N and the kringle domains, was subjected to 10 rounds of two-fold averaging using the RAVE program49. The averaged map allowed ~70% of residues to be correctly modeled using the O molecular graphics package, yielding a value for Rcryst of 48% (Rfree of 49%). This model represented the initial structure for the refinement. Non-crystallographic constraints were used in the first two rounds of the refinement. In the following rounds they were replaced by restraints, and in the last three rounds the non-crystallographic restraints were completely removed. The first three cycles of the refinement included a simulated annealing protocol, and the last

five cycles included only the Powell minimization protocol. The temperature factor refinement included: overall B-factor refinement in the early rounds, and restrained individual B-factor refinement in the later stages. At the start of each refinement round, a solvent mask was calculated and a correction for bulk solvent was applied to FPART. The model rebuilding was performed on sigmaA weighted 2Fo - Fc, Fo - Fc and annealed omit maps. The linker regions were introduced at the later stages of the refinement when the electron density was clearly visible. In the final map the electron density was weak in the following regions: the N-terminus of the N domain (residues 28­37 in both protomers), a loop in the N-domain of protomer A (residues 52­58), the side chains of several surface residues (Ile 132, Ile 156, Leu 163, Arg 168, Arg 181, Glu 195) and the C-terminal residue 210. Several different refinement protocols were tried, but none of them was able to improve either the quality of the electron density in these regions or the value of Rfree. Residues 28­37 and 210 were omitted in both molecules, and the other residues with poorly defined side chains were replaced by alanines. The R-factor to Rfree ratio clearly indicates that the structure was not overrefined. Both the NK1 protomers in the asymmetric unit exhibit good geometry and have no residues in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Coordinates. The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1nk1).
