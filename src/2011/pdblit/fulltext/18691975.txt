Intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM-5, telencephalin) is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on neurons in the most rostral segment of the mammalian brain, the telencephalon. Antibody studies in rodents and rabbits have demonstrated expression of this molecule on the cell body and dendrites of these neurons. We have examined the expression pattern in human brain by Northern blot analysis of 16 human brain segments. This analysis has confirmed the unique expression pattern of this ICAM in human. In addition, we report the mapping of the human ICAM-5 gene to an 80-kb region on chromosome 19p13.2 that also contains ICAM-1 and ICAM-3. © 1998 Academic Press

ICAM-5 (telencephalin) is a member of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) family, which in turn is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The five described ICAMs share many structural and functional features (6). Structurally, all of the ICAMs are type I transmembrane glycoproteins composed of two to nine Ig-like extracellular domains, followed by a transmembrane region and a cytoplasmic domain. The capacity of the ICAMs to interact with members of the 2 integrin family through a motif in their N-terminal domain (16) is a functional trait that helps define the family. Many important cell­ cell interactions are mediated through the ICAM­integrin connection. Principally, these cell­ cell interactions have been involved in leukocyte activation or migration across endothelial or epithelial barriers. The recent descriptions of an erythrocyte ICAM (LW, ICAM-4) (2) and a neuronal ICAM (Telencephalin, ICAM-5) (8, 19) will undoubtedly expand the physiologic significance of these interactions. Genetically, four of the five ICAMs (all but ICAM-2) are clustered on a region of chromosome 19p13.2 (5, 8, 15). This clear indication of gene duplication events argues

for the existence of a primordial ICAM whose expression pattern and functional significance have expanded as new members have arisen. ICAM-5 is unique in a number of regards. It is composed of nine extracellular Ig-like domains, whereas the other ICAMs have either two domains (ICAM-2 and ICAM-4) or five domains (ICAM-1 and ICAM-3). It differs from the other ICAMs in its tissue distribution. As defined by immunohistochemistry in the rabbit, it is expressed only on a subset of neurons within the most rostral segment of the brain, the telencephalon (9, 11). In addition to the spatial regulation of the gene, it is regulated temporally in development, first being expressed at birth and remaining on throughout life (19). Given the ability of ICAM-5 to bind the 2 integrin CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) (8, 14), ICAM-5 might be a critical component in neuron­microglial cell interactions in the course of normal development or as part of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, ICAM-5 levels are lower in the brain tissue of patients suffering from Alzheimers disease (7). The link between the drop in ICAM-5 levels and this disease remains to be elucidated. The initial studies of the expression pattern of ICAM-5 (telencephalin) were conducted in the rabbit (9). Speciesspecific differences in gene regulation have been noted in other systems, leaving open the question about the expression of ICAM-5 in humans. We have assessed the expression of human ICAM-5 by analysis of multitissue and brain region-specific Northerns (Fig. 1a). The only tissue that gave a signal from among the 16 tested was brain. Within the brain, only regions derived from the telencephalon contained the 3-kb band. The highest level of expression is observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, followed by the amygdala, caudate nucleus, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and putamen. Low levels of expression are seen in the corpus callosum, subthalamic nucleus, and thalamus while the hypothalamus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord are all negative. Thus the distribution of the protein as assessed by antibody staining in the rabbit is corroborated by the results of the Northern analysis of human RNA.

FIG. 1. (a) Northern blot analysis of the expression of human ICAM-5 in different tissues and subregions of the brain is shown. Following hybridization with a radiolabeled cDNA probe from the extracellular domains of ICAM-5, the blots were striped and probed with a -actin probe to control for RNA integrity and concentration in each lane. The only organ system that hybridized with the ICAM-5 probe was the brain. Within the brain, the 3-kb band for ICAM-5 was seen only in regions of the telencephalon, including the amygdala, caudate nucleus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, cerebral cortex, occipital pole, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and putamen. (b) The genomic organization of the genes encoding human ICAMs 1, 3, and 5 is shown. Transcriptional orientation of ICAM-1 and ICAM-5 is shown with arrows below the restriction map of the P1 clone 1566. The orientation of ICAM-3 relative to the other two genes was not determined. The region encompassing the coding region of ICAM-5 (Accession No. AF082802) is expanded and shown below the map. The 11 exons are denoted with black boxes.

In addition, we report the detailed genomic mapping of ICAM-5 relative to ICAMs 1 and 3. ICAMs 1, 3, 4 (LW), and ICAM-5 have all been mapped to human chromosome 19p13.2 (5, 8, 15). We have identified a single P1 clone, approximately 85 kb in length, that contains ICAMs 1, 3, and 5 (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO; Clone 1566). ICAM-5 was identified by low-stringency hybridization of the P1 clone with probes derived from ICAM-1 or ICAM-3. The restriction map of the P1 clone revealed that ICAM-1 and ICAM-5 are separated by only 5 kb (Fig. 1b). ICAM-3 is located 30 ­ 40 kb downstream of ICAM-5. The orientation of the genes places the upstream regulatory region of ICAM-5 in the 5-kb region that separates ICAMs 1 and 5. Given the chromatin unfolding that must occur for ICAM-1 expression, negative transcriptional elements must exist to regulate the expression of the closely linked ICAM-5 gene. The lymphotoxin and TNF genes are another example of two related genes with very distinct patterns of expression residing very close to each other on the chromosome (12). Two BamHI fragments containing the entire ICAM-5

genomic sequence were subcloned from the P1 clone (Accession No. AF082802). The human telencephalin gene is composed of 11 exons encoding the signal peptide and each of the nine extracellular domains and with a single exon encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1b). This intron­exon structure is shared by other members of the ICAM family, further supporting the likelihood that these genes arose from gene duplication of a primordial ICAM. Both human and murine ICAM-1 genes are composed of 7 exons encoding the signal peptide and each of the five extracellular domains, followed by the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions on a single exon (4, 17). ICAM-2 is organized into 4 exons, one encoding the signal peptide, one exon for each of the two extracellular domains, and a final exon for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (18). ICAM-3 shares this general organization pattern as well (R. Vazeau, ICOS Corp., unpublished results). The proximity of the ICAM-5 gene to ICAM-1 has been conserved through mammalian evolution. Murine ICAM-1 has been mapped to the proximal arm of chromosome 9, a segment syntenic with human chromo-

some 19 (3). Backcross analysis in mice has suggested that ICAMs 1 and 5 are very close together (13). The clustering of related genes on a chromosome has been described in other gene families, e.g., chemokines and their receptors (1, 5, 10). Interestingly, there is no report of a murine homologue for human ICAM-3. Analysis of murine P1 clones from this region did not identify a gene homologous to ICAM-3, leaving open the possibility that the ICAM-3 gene has been deleted from the murine genome (P. Kilgannon, ICOS Corp., unpublished results). Alternatively, ICAM-3 might have arisen after the evolutionary split between rodents and humans. This situation may be analogous to the apparent absence of the important inflammatory molecule IL8 from mice (20). It is possible that compensatory mechanisms exist in mice that account for function associated with ICAM-3 in humans. In summary, we have characterized the expression pattern of the neural ICAM, ICAM-5, confirming by molecular methods that it is expressed exclusively in the regions of the human brain that make up the telencephalon. In addition, we have mapped the gene for human ICAM-5 to a region on chromosome 19p13.2, immediately adjacent to ICAM-1 and within 30 ­ 40 kb of ICAM-3. Given the structural, functional, and genetic similarities between the ICAMs, we suggest that the neural ICAM, telencephalin, be referred to as ICAM-5. This nomenclature is consistent with the recent designation of the blood group antigen, LW, as ICAM-4 (Gahmberg, University of Helsinki, Finland, pers. comm., March 1998).
