Abstract Phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) on threonines with a distinct autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase [Guo and Damuni (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90,2500&2504] inactivated the phosphatase with "P-1abelled myelin basic protein prepared by incubation with the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, the src-family protein kinases ~56"~ and ~60'."", myelin basic protein kinase-1, or protamine kinase. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, ~56"' and p60"" phosphorylated myelin basic protein on tyrosines, that the protamine kinase phosphorylated myelin basic protein on serines, and that myelin basic protein kinase-1 phosphorylated myelin basic protein on threonines. The results demonstrate that the autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase not only inactivates the protein serinelthreonine phosphatase, but also the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PPZA. This autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase-mediated inactivation of PP2A may, in response to extracellular stimuli, not only contribute to the enhanced phosphorylation of cellular proteins on serines and threonines but also on tyrosines.

1.Introduction
Evidence has accumulated that the low but detectable protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)' [l-3], a multifunctional and ubiquitous protein serine/ threonine phosphatase [46], may be physiologically relevant. For example, okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of the protein serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphatase activities of PP2A [7,8], not only enhances the phosphorylation of cellular proteins on serines and threonines, but also on tyrosines [9]. Furthermore, immmunoprecipitates from polyoma-transformed cells with antibody to middle or small T antigens exhibit high okadaic acid sensitive protein tyrosine phosphatase activity [8]. These immunoprecipitates contain the PP2A catalytic C subunit of apparent M, -36,000 and the PP2A A subunit of apparent M, -60,000, of which become associated with the midboth dle or small T antigens following viral transformation [lO,ll]. Cayla et al. [12,13] also have identified a novel protein of apparent M, -37-39,000 designated PTPA (PhosphoTyrosyl Phosphatase Activator), which, in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, activates markedly the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP2A,, a form of PP2A composed of the A and C subunits, but not PP2A,, which contains a B subunit of apparent M, -55,000 in addition to the A and C subunits. The mechanism of action of PTPA is unknown, although phosphorylation has been ruled out [ 12,131. Earlier studies demonstrated that the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP2A2 could also be enhanced markedly following incubation of the phosphatase with ATP [14,15], PP, [14,15], or tubulin [16]. However, by contrast to

PTPA and tubulin, incubation with ATP or PP,, also inactivated the protein serineithreonine phosphatase activity of the phosphatase [ 14,151. We have recently purified to apparent homogeneity a novel protein serine/threonine kinase of apparent M, -36,000 from extracts of bovine kidney [17]. Purified preparations of this enzyme underwent an unusually rapid (t,,, -0.5-l min) intramolecular autophosphorylation reaction which activated the kinase about lo-fold [17]. Hence, the enzyme was designated as the Autophosphorylation-activated protein Kinase (AK). Autophosphorylation and concomittant activation of AK were reversed by incubation with PP2A or PPl [17]. Subsequent studies revealed that, in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, AK inactivated PP2A [18], but not PPl (unpublished observation), about 80% with several substrates including AK itself, a distinct insulin-stimulated cytosolic protein serine/threonine Protamine Kinase (cPK) [19,20], and 32P-labelled myelin basic protein (MBP) prepared by incubation with cPK. Analysis by autoradiography after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography to resolve AK from the PP2A preparations, showed that the C subunit of the phosphatase was phosphorylated following incubation with AK [18]. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that the C subunit was phosphorylated on threonines [18]. Analysis by thin layer chromatography established that PP2A underwent an autodephosphorylation reaction which was inhibited by microcystin-LR [18], another potent inhibitor of PPZA [21]. In the presence of this inhibitor, AK also incorporated about 1 mol of phosphoryl groups per mol of the A subunit of the PP2A preparations [18]. However, the functional significance of this phosphorylation was not determined. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of AK on the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP2A. In this report, we show that, unlike PTPA [13], ATP [14,15], PP, [14,15], and tubulin [16], AK inactivates the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP2A. The results suggest that AKmediated inactivation of PP2A may, in response to extracellular stimuli, not only contribute to the enhanced phosphorylation

AK 1191. PP2A, [22], PP2A, [22], MBP[23], and myelin basic pro&n kinase:l (MBPK: 1) [24] were purified to apparent homogeneity as described. All other materials are given in the references [20,24]. Protein was determined according to Bradford [25]. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli [26].
2.2. Enzyme assays Determination of the activities of PP2A, [22], PP2A, [22], cPK [20], MBPK-1 [23], and AK [19] was performed as described. One unit of PP2A activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the release of 1 nmol of phosphoryl groups from 3ZP-labelled MBP/min. To ensure linearity, the extent of phosphoryl group release was limited to < 10%. One unit of cPK activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphoryl groups into protamine sulfate/min. One unit of AK and MBPK-1 activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphoryl groups into MBP/min. The activities of p561ck, ~60'."" and EGFRK were determined using MBP as a substrate. The incubations were performed in a microcentrifuge tube and contained 50 mM T&chloride, pH 7.0, buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 14 mM /I-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MgCl,, 2 mM MnCl,, 0.2 mM [y-"P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol), 0.4 PM microcystin-LR, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 50 pg MBP in a final volume of 0.05 ml. Reactions were initiated with MBP and terminated after 10 min at 30" C with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 12,000 x g, the pellets were washed five times with 1 ml portions of trichloroacetic acid. The radioactivity in the pellets was then determined after addition of 1 ml of scintillant to the microcentrifuge tubes. Kinase was omitted from control incubations. One unit of p561ck,p60"`", and EGFRK activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the incorporation of 1 nmol of phosphoryl groups into MBP/min. 2.3. Preparation of `2P-labelled substrates `ZP-labelled MBP was prepared by incubation with cPK or MBPK-1 as described [IS] or by incubation with p561ck, ~60'.`" or EGFRK. The incubations with ~56"`. ~60"~"" EGFRK were nerformed in a microor centrifuge tube and contained 50 mM Tris-chloride, pH 7.0, buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 14 mM /I-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM MgCI,, 2 mM MnCl,, 0.2 mM [Y-~*P]ATP(2,000 cpm/pmol), 1.25 mg MBP, and 50 units of protein tyrosine kinase in a final volume of 0.25 ml. Reactions were initiated with MBP, and terminated with 1 ml of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid after 60 min of incubation at 30°C. The mixtures were then centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge and the supematant was discarded. The pellets were washed eight times with 1 ml portions of trichloroacetic acid followed by three times with 1 ml portions of 99% ethanol. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-chloride, pH 7.0, buffer containing 10% glycerol and 1 mM benzamidine. The solutions were ahquoted and stored at -70°C. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described [271. Autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-Omat AR5 film.

The results presented in Fig. 2 show that PP2A, dephosphorylated the MBP preparations prepared by incubation with EGFRK, cPK or MBPK-1. Similar results were obtained with PP2A, (not shown). The activities of PP2A, and PP2A, were inhibited by okadaic acid or microcystin-LR with the [32P]tyrosine-, the [3ZP]serine- or the [32P]threonine-labelled MBP preparations as substrate (not shown). In the standard assays, half-maximal inhibition occurred at about 1 nM okadaic acid or microcystin-LR. These results are consistent with earlier observations (e.g. [S]) that both the protein serine/threonine and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities of PP2A are inhibited by okadaic acid and microcystin-LR. With the [32P]serine- and [32P]threonine-labelled MBP preparations, PP2A, and PP2A, exhibited an apparent K,,, of about 0.1 PM and 0.25 ,uM, respectively.

313 AK-catalyzed phosphorylation and concomitant inactivation of PP2A is nonetheless similar to the PTPA- and tubulin-mediated activations of the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP2A [12,16] in that it also is transient [20] (this study, not shown). Whether the AK-catalyzed phosphorylation of PP2A has any effect on the activation of the phosphatase by PTPA or tubulin or vice versa remains to be determined. Several hormones and other extracellular stimuli enhance the phosphorylation of cellular proteins on serines, threonines and tyrosines (reviewed in [28]). These phosphorylations control the activities of rate-limiting enzymes involved in diverse cellular processes and are therefore considered important in signal transduction [28]. Because the state of phosphorylation of any protein depends on the relative activities of the protein kinases and phosphatases, enhanced phosphorylation on serines, threonines, and tyrosines may result from the activation of protein kinases (reviewed in [28]) and/or the inactivation of protein phosphatases. Because PP2A is a `dual specificity' protein phosphatase (e.g. Fig. 2), the results presented herein suggest that AK-mediated inactivation of PP2A (Fig. 3) may, in response to hormones and other extracellular stimuli, not only contribute to the enhanced phosphorylation of cellular proteins on serines and threonines, but also on tyrosines. Consistent with these possibilities is a recent report indicating that PP2A is inactivated, albeit by an unknown mechanism, following incubation of rat skeletal muscle cells with insulin [29]. In addition, okadaic acid, a potent inhibitor of the protein serinel threonine and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities of PP2A [7,8], not only enhanced the phosphorylation of cellular

4. Discussion The results presented in this communication establish that AK not only inactivates the protein serine/threonine, but also the protein tyrosine phosphatase activities of PP2A, and PPZA, (Figs. l-3). These AK-mediated effects are clearly different from the effects of PTPA [12], ATP [14,15], PP, [14,15], and tubulin [16], which, by contrast to AK, activate the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PP2A. Moreover, unlike PTPA [12], ATP (14,151, PP, [14,15], and tubulin [16], which exhibit activity with PP2A, but apparently not with PP2A,, AK inactivated the protein serine/threonine and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities of PP2A, (Figs. l-3) and PP2A, (not shown). Also unlike PTPA [12] and tubulin [16], which have little or no effect on the protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity of PP2A, AK inactivated the protein serinelthreonine phosphatase activity of the PP2A preparations (Figs. l-3).

proteins on serines and threonines, but also on tyrosines [9]. However, whether okadaic acid inhibition of PP2A was directly and/or indirectly responsible for the enhanced protein tyrosine phosphorylations in the cells was not established [9] perhaps, in part, because physiological substrates specific for the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity of PPZA have not yet been identified. Recent studies have indicated that PP2A may itself be its own physiologically relevant protein tyrosine phosphorylated substrate [30]. Thus, it was reported that, in the presence of okadaic acid, the C subunit of PP2A could be phosphorylated stoichiometrically on tyrosine residues by immunoprecipitates of p60'~"" from cells overexpressing the gene for this enzyme, the src-family protein kinase p561Ck, and purified preparations of the protein tyrosine-specific epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors [30]. Because phosphorylation of the C subunit was less than stoichiometric when okadaic acid was omitted from the incubations, the results were interpreted to indicate that okadaic acid inhibited PP2A from undergoing an autotyrosine-dephosphorylation reaction [30]. The observations reported herein suggested that this PP2A auto-tyrosinedephosphorylation reaction may be inactivated by the AK catalyzed threonine phosphorylation of the C subunit of the phosphatase. However, at variance with the earlier observations [30], we have, in many attempts, observed little or no phosphorylation of the C subunit of PP2A with purified preparations of p60'"", ~56"~ and EGFRK in the absence or presence of okadaic acid. The reason for these discrepancies is uncertain. In this connection, it is noteworthy that the PP2A preparations employed in this study can be methylated at the of carboxyl terminal Leu 309 their C subunit by purified preparations of a methyltransferase from bovine brain [31]. Therefore, the C subunit of the PPZA preparations employed in this study is not partially cleaved and contains the putative Tyr307 phosphorylation site [30]. Whether methylation affects the phosphorylation of the C subunit on threonines and/or tyrosines is of considerable interest and is currently under investigation in this laboratory.
