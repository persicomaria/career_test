Remodeling of the extracellular matrix ­ regulated by the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors ­ is an important component of disease progression in many chronic disease states. Unchecked MMP activity can result in significant tissue damage, facilitate disease progression and is associated with host responses to pathologic injury, such as angiogenesis. The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been shown to regulate MMP activity. However, recent findings demonstrate that an MMPindependent effect of TIMP-2 inhibits the mitogenic response of human microvascular endothelial cells to growth factors. This is the first demonstration of a cellsurface signaling receptor for a member of the TIMP family and suggests that TIMP-2 functions to regulate cellular responses to growth factors. These new findings are integrated in a comprehensive model of TIMP-2 function in tissue homeostasis. Extracellular matrix remodeling and chronic disease Many chronic disease states are characterized by an imbalance between tissue destruction and endogenous mechanisms of tissue repair, potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of continued and expanding cellular injury coupled with incomplete repair or resolution. These pathologic conditions frequently disrupt the function and structural organization of both the parenchymal (cellular elements) and connective-tissue stroma, such that the injury cannot be repaired by simple regeneration of the parenchymal elements alone. The resulting tissue damage is further complicated by host responses elicited during the initial pathologic insult. One such host response is the proliferation of new blood vessels, termed angiogenesis, which is frequently associated with chronic diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. The initiation of new blood vessel formation is due to a shift in the local balance of pro-angiogenic factors and endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis; that is, the angiogenic switch [1,2]. The angiogenic response might exacerbate the underlying pathology or disease progression (i.e. cancer metastasis). Pro-angiogenic factors, such as the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, induce the expression of matrix-degrading proteinases, the activity of which

results in remodeling of the extracellular matrix to facilitate the invasion of new blood vessels [1,3]. The inhibition of proteinase activity can diminish the angiogenic response which, in some disease states, can resolve the underlying pathology and/or arrest disease progression. This finding suggests that protease inhibitors could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic diseases, such as cancer. However, the translation of this strategy to the treatment of human cancer has been disappointing [4]. The reasons for this failure remain unclear, but suggest that our understanding of the molecular and cellular events involved in tissue remodeling and host responses, such as angiogenesis, are at best incomplete. Further understanding of the mechanisms of tissue homeostasis and repair should lead to novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory and malignant diseases. Previous studies suggest that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 is a unique member of the TIMP family because it can directly suppress the proliferation of human endothelial cells [5], and this function is independent of the ability of TIMP-2 to inhibit metalloproteinase activity [6,7]. Based upon this, we propose a more comprehensive model for TIMP-2 in maintaining tissue homeostasis and describe the potential clinical implications of these findings.

TIMPs: MMP inhibitors and activators Members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family have been shown to mediate both tissue development (organogenesis) and remodeling. Collectively, the twentyfour members of the mammalian MMP family can degrade all components of the extracellular matrix and many of these protease activities have been specifically associated with pathologic tissue destruction in chronic diseases such as cancer and arthritis. The role of metalloproteinases in cancer, inflammation and other diseases has been reviewed elsewhere [3,4,8­10]. TIMPs have been identified in species ranging from drosophila, zebrafish and Caenorhabditis elegans to humans, suggesting that these proteins are ancient eukaryotic proteins [11­13]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown developmental defects in TIMP-deficient organisms in both non-mammalian and mammalian systems, suggesting the importance of these proteins during embryonic development, in addition to possible

functional redundancy of some TIMPs during mammalian development [14­17]. The mammalian TIMP family has four members, which share significant homology and structural identity. The features of the TIMP family members are described in Table 1 and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere [11­13]. TIMP-2 is unique as a member of the TIMP family in that, in addition to inhibiting MMPs, it selectively interacts with membrane type-1 (MT1)-MMP to facilitate the cell-surface activation of pro-MMP-2 [18]. Thus, TIMP-2 functions as an inhibitor of MMPs and is required for the cellular mechanism of pro-MMP-2 activation. Identification of non-MMP-dependent TIMP functions Cloning of the TIMP-1 cDNA revealed sequence identity with a novel growth-factor-like activity known as erythroidpotentiating activity (EPA) [19]. EPA was identified as a T lymphoblastic factor present in serum that supports the growth of erythroid precursors in vitro by a mechanism involving direct cell-surface binding [20]. EPA potentiates erythropoietin (EPO)-stimulated colony formation by early or late erythroid stem cells (BFU-E or CFU-E). Subsequently, TIMP-2 was also shown to have EPA, suggesting that this biological activity might be attributed to a common structural element, which remains to be identified [21]. However, some investigators felt that the dual EPA and MMP inhibitor functions for these proteins were `incongruous' [22]. The argument for this conclusion was principally based on the observation that TIMPs are ubiquitously expressed and the in vivo plasma concentration of TIMP-1, at w17 nM, was well above the concentration of 80 pM required for the maximal physiologic effect of EPA. The physiologic significance of EPA and its relationship to other TIMP functions remain unresolved. Although TIMPs have been principally viewed as functioning exclusively as MMP inhibitors, there remains a significant body of data, starting with the original cloning of TIMP-1, suggesting that TIMPs might have other biological functions. Hayakawa and colleagues [23] were the first to report that TIMP-1 present in serum acted as a growth factor to support the in vitro proliferation of a variety of cell types that included both normal mesenchymal and epithelial cells, in addition to several tumor cell lines. In these

experiments, the depletion of TIMP-1 from the bovine serum used in cell culture was necessary to observe the growth effects of TIMP-1. Interestingly, TIMP-2 did not stimulate cell growth in these experiments, suggesting that these effects are TIMP-1 specific, although the requirement for MMP inhibitory activity was not examined. TIMP-3 has been shown to promote apoptosis in several in vitro systems [11,12]. It remains unclear if this effect is mediated independently of MMP inhibition by TIMP-3. Recent findings in TIMP-3-null mice suggest that TIMP-3 can either promote or inhibit apoptosis depending on the model system examined [15,16]. In vivo data now show that TIMP-3-deficient mice have an increase in TNF-aconverting enzyme (TACE) activity that, in a liver regeneration model, results in chronic hepatic inflammation and the failure of the liver to regenerate [24]. These results suggest that the effects of TIMP-3 on cell fate are mediated by the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity, in this case TACE, also known as ADAM17, and not a member of the MMP family. Interestingly, TIMP-3 also functions as a direct antagonist of the VEGF receptor VEGFR2, resulting in the inhibition of angiogenesis, a function that is clearly independent of MMP inhibition [25]. TIMP-4 reportedly enhances or inhibits the in vivo growth of tumor xenografts; however, the mechanism of these effects has not been described [26,27]. Additional reports of novel biological functions for TIMPs have continued to appear in the literature. These include potential roles for TIMPs as growth factors, survival factors and growth inhibitors or in the suppression of programmed cell death, the induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis and other functions [12,28­30]. The central issue regarding all of these potential biological activities of the TIMPs is: are they unique or dependent on the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity? TIMP tissue distribution: clues to new functions? Few studies have examined the expression and localization of TIMPs in adult tissues. However, we know from in vitro studies that the transcriptional activation of TIMP expression is differentially regulated. In many cell types, the expression of TIMP-2 is constitutive, whereas TIMP-1 and TIMP-3 expression can be induced by a variety of growth factors and cytokines.

TIMP-3 is unique among the TIMP family in that it has been shown to specifically interact with sulfated glycosaminoglycans and as a result is sequestered in the extracellular matrix [31]; the other TIMP family members remain soluble and diffusible. Although the biological significance of the matrix association of TIMP-3 has not been determined, it suggests that the pericellular distribution and availability of TIMP-3 for cell-surface interactions might be more restricted than other members of the TIMP family. Furthermore, many in vitro studies of TIMP-3 cellular functions have been conducted by the addition of soluble, exogenous recombinant TIMP-3 and have not addressed the matrix binding of this inhibitor. Quantitative PCR has been used to study the expression of all four mammalian TIMPs in the mouse [32]. TIMP-2 was constitutively expressed at high levels in all tissues of the adult mouse, with the expression of the other three TIMPs demonstrating more selective patterns of tissue distribution. These patterns for tissue expression of TIMPs are identical to previous studies [33] and the constitutive high-level expression of at least one TIMP family member in each organ of the adult mouse suggests that TIMPs `provide a crucial checkpoint for tissue degradation' [32]. Although this study did not localize the cellular expression of the TIMPs, previous studies of TIMP-2 expression by in situ hybridization suggest selective expression in the stromal compartment, with a complete absence of TIMP-2 transcripts in epithelial cells [33]. It should be pointed out that although TIMP concentrations might be significant in some `normal' tissues, the expression of active MMPs species in `normal' tissues is usually very low or nonexistent [32]. This raises the question: what is the functional role of TIMPs in normal tissues lacking MMP activity or evidence of active extracellular-matrix remodeling?

TIMPs: inhibitors of angiogenesis By virtue of their ability to inhibit metalloproteinase activity, all four members of the TIMP family function as inhibitors of angiogenesis. This general principal is supported by the demonstration that TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 show potent anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo [34,35], although some evidence suggests that the mechanisms of these activities differ [28]. Furthermore, the synthetic MMP inhibitor (BB94) effectively blocked angiogenesis in a murine hemangioma model in vivo [36]. These findings suggested that the inhibition of MMP activity, either by TIMPs or synthetic MMP inhibitors, was sufficient to block angiogenesis in vivo. Combined with additional evidence that synthetic MMP inhibitors could block tumor-cell invasion, tumor growth and reduce metastasis formation, these data provided strong support for the development of synthetic MMP inhibitors for the treatment of human cancer [36]. Unfortunately, the enormous industrial effort involved in the development and preclinical testing of synthetic MMP inhibitors has not produced significant results in clinical trials in patients with cancer [4], although the reasons for this failure are not completely understood.

TIMP-2: an endogenous and bi-functional inhibitor of angiogenesis In 1990, Moses and colleagues [37] isolated and characterized a novel anti-angiogenic agent from bovine cartilage, the cartilage-derived inhibitor (CDI) of angiogenesis. CDI co-purified with MMP-inhibitor activity and was shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, CDI inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in response to FGF-1 stimulation in vitro and blocked endothelial cell migration. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CDI suggested that it was TIMP related, showing close identity with TIMP-2 [37]. Subsequently, both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were shown to inhibit polyamine-stimulated angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay, but the effects on endothelial cell proliferation and/or migration were not examined [38]. It is interesting to note that in these experiments, both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 inhibited stimulated angiogenesis (polyamine-dependent) but did not alter vascular development in non-stimulated three-dayold chick chorioallantoic membrane assays. This suggests that the process defined as vasculogenesis (de novo development of an organized vascular system) is functionally distinct from angiogenesis (development of new vessels from existing vasculature), with respect to both requirements for MMP activity and sensitivity to TIMP inhibition. Together, the experiments of Moses et al. and Hayakawa et al. [23,37] suggested that although both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 inhibit angiogenesis, the mechanism of these effects might be different. To address this issue, Murphy et al. [5] examined the ability of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and migration. These experiments demonstrated that TIMP-2, but not TIMP-1 or the synthetic MMP inhibitor BB-94, inhibited the FGF-2stimulated proliferation of human endothelial cells. This inhibitory effect was not observed using a pro-MMP-2­ TIMP-2 complex, suggesting that only free TIMP-2 was capable of inhibiting endothelial cell growth in response to FGF-2 stimulation. Furthermore, TIMP-2 slightly inhibited endothelial cell migration in response to FGF-2 stimulation and appeared to promote endothelial cell adhesion. The comparison of these effects of TIMP-2 with the lack of effect of either TIMP-1 or BB-94 led us to conclude that the effects of TIMP-2 on endothelial cell proliferation were unique biological activities of this member of the TIMP family, independent of MMP inhibitory activity and possibly mediated by a cell-surfacereceptor mechanism. Following these observations, investigations began to focus on the interaction of TIMP-2 with the cell surface. However, with the demonstration of a cell-surface mechanism for the activation of pro-MMP-2 by MT1-MMP that is mediated by the interaction of TIMP-2 with MT1-MMP [11­13], it became evident that MT-MMPs represent a cellsurface binding site for TIMP-2. This finding suggests that one possible mechanism through which TIMP-2 could influence cell growth was by binding to MT1-MMP, which would act as a signaling receptor. However, no evidence to demonstrate that MT1-MMP can act as a `signaling' receptor following TIMP-2 binding has been forthcoming.

In 1999, Wingfield et al. [39] reported a novel TIMP-2 mutant devoid of MMP inhibitory activity. This mutant enabled investigators to assess the requirement for MMP inhibitory activity in the TIMP-2 suppression of cell growth and identify potential cell-surface TIMP-2 binding sites. The preparation of this mutant was accomplished through appending a single alanine to the N-terminus of TIMP-2 to produce AlaCTIMP-2 [39]. AlaCTIMP-2 does not inhibit MMP-2 or MT1-MMP activity nor mediate MT1-MMP activation of pro-MMP-2 [6,39]. Furthermore, the inability of AlaCTIMP-2 to inhibit MMP activity was reversible by treatment with aminopeptidase activity that removes the N-terminal Ala residue [39]. This suggests that, other than the single Ala residue at the N-terminus, the remainder of the TIMP-2 is correctly folded and capable of inhibiting MMP activity once the Ala residue blocking the N-terminus is enzymatically removed. Subsequently, this AlaCTIMP-2 mutant was used to explore the interaction of TIMP-2 with the cell surface. Both TIMP-2 and AlaCTIMP-2 bound to the surface of human A549 lung cancer cells with high affinity (KdZ147 pM) and this binding was not competed for by the synthetic MMP inhibitor BB94 or TIMP-1 [6]. Furthermore, the binding of AlaCTIMP-2 showed only partial competition with MT1-MMP-blocking antibodies, and immunofluorescence co-localization studies demonstrated that TIMP-2 and AlaCTIMP-2 binding was, at least in part, independent of MT1-MMP. These findings have been confirmed by investigators who have shown two distinct cell-surface binding sites for TIMP-2 [40], that cell-surface binding of TIMP-2 is independent of the level of MT1-MMP expression [41] and that not all cellsurface-bound TIMP-2 can be competed by synthetic MMP inhibitors [40]. More recently, Moses and colleagues [42] definitively demonstrated the uncoupling of the MMP-inhibitory and an ti-angiogenic activities of TIMP-2. This was accomplished using the Pichia pastoris expression system to engineer and produce both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of TIMP-2. They found that although both domains of TIMP-2 inhibited angiogenesis in the embryonic CAM assay, the C-terminal and wild-type TIMP-2 were more effective inhibitors of angiogenesis in the mouse corneal pocket assay (in which angiogenesis is driven by the addition of exogenous pro-angiogenic mitogens) than was the N-terminal TIMP-2 domain. Furthermore, the inhibitory ability of the N-terminal domain was dependent on MMP-inhibitory activity, because blocking the N-terminus of the TIMP-2 N-terminal fragment by appending glutamic acid (E) and alanine residues (A) reversed the MMP-inhibitory activity and in vivo anti-angiogenic activity of this TIMP-2 domain [42]. The activity of TIMP-2 that inhibits endothelial cell proliferation was localized to the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2, specifically to the C-terminal disulfide loop, referred to as loop 6 [42]. The cell-surface binding of TIMP-2 to human microvascular endothelial cells has also been examined. The binding of TIMP-2 to the endothelial cell surface and the ability to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation were shown to be independent of MMP inhibition, as demonstrated by

AlaCTIMP-2 [7]. The binding of TIMP-2 to the human microvascular endothelial cell surface was saturable and reversible, with a dissociation constant in the order of 900 pM (the same order of magnitude previously reported for TIMP-2 binding to human tumor cells). The binding of TIMP-2 to the endothelial cell surface did not antagonize growth factor (FGF-2 or VEGF-A) binding, did not compete with growth-factor-receptor-blocking antibodies (anti-VEGFR-2 or anti-FGFR-1) or MT1-MMP-blocking antibodies. Competition binding studies suggested that TIMP-2 binding to the surface of human microvascular endothelial cells could be competed for by anti-b1- and anti-a3- integrin blocking antibodies. The interaction of TIMP-2 with a3b1 cell-surface integrin was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments in which antibodies against TIMP-2 resulted in the selective co-immunoprecipitation of a3b1 integrin. The ability of TIMP-2 to inhibit growth in response to tyrosine-kinase growth-factor stimulation was dependent on the cell-surface expression of b1-integrin subunits, which was demonstrated using b1-null fibroblasts. These studies also demonstrate that the ability of TIMP-2 to inhibit human microvascular endothelial cell proliferation is sensitive to the selective but nonspecific protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate in vitro [7]. Seo et al. [7] tentatively identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-1 as a mediator of TIMP-2related inhibition of endothelial cell growth in vitro. The treatment of human microvascular endothelial cells with TIMP-2 resulted in a decreased association of Shp-1 with b1-integrin subunits and increased Shp-1 association with tyrosine-kinase growth-factor receptors (both VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1), resulting in a concomitant decrease in the activation and phosphorylation of either VEGFR-2 or FGFR-1 (summarized in Figure 1). Furthermore, the ability of TIMP-2 to suppress cell growth in response to mitogenic stimulation (VEGF-A or FGF-2) was abrogated by the expression of dominant-negative Shp-1 [7]. Surprisingly, in these studies the in vivo antiangiogenic activity of TIMP-2 was completely abrogated by the inclusion of the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate, confirming that this activity is also required for TIMP-2-induced inhibition of angiogenesis in vivo. These findings suggest that the growthsuppressive activity of TIMP-2 is a major contribution to the anti-angiogenic activity of TIMP-2 in vivo [7]. A new model for TIMP-2 in endothelial cell homeostasis The finding that TIMP-2 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis in vivo through a mechanism that is independent of MMPs implies a dual function for this member of the TIMP family. How do these new data integrate with our current view of TIMP functions? First, we recognize that TIMP-2 is a member of the TIMP family and, as such, is a potent inhibitor of metalloproteinase activity. Second, TIMP-2 is unique among members of the TIMP family in that low concentrations of TIMP-2 facilitate the activation of pro-MMP-2 through a cellsurface mechanism involving MT1-MMP. TIMP-2 is ubiquitously expressed at significant levels in many adult tissues of the mammalian organism before the

Figure 1. The mechanism of TIMP-2-induced inhibition of endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. The binding of TIMP-2 to the a3b1 integrin results in the dissociation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp-1 from the integrin complex. The binding of angiogenic growth factors to their cognate receptor tyrosine kinase normally results in receptor activation, as demonstrated by trans-phosphorylation of the dimeric receptor subunits. The treatment of endothelial cells with TIMP-2 before growth factor stimulation results in receptor inactivation mediated by an increased association of the cytosolic tail of the receptor with Shp-1.

initiation of tissue responses to pathologic insult. TIMP-2related inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation requires free TIMP-2 that is not complexed with an MMP active site, and is mediated by binding to a3b1. Finally, the results of studies by Hayakawa et al. [23] and Moses et al. [37] suggest that TIMP-2 is more effective at inhibiting angiogenesis than inhibiting vasculogenesis. In response to these observations, we suggest the following model for the bi-functional regulation of tissue homeostasis presented in the context of the angiogenic response (Figure 2). In quiescent normal tissues, the levels of TIMP-2 are sufficient to enable free uncomplexed TIMP-2 to accumulate in the pericellular milieu. The source of this TIMP-2 might be stromal fibroblasts, perivascular smooth muscle or endothelial cells, all of which have been shown to synthesize and secrete TIMP-2 in vitro. In these quiescent adult tissues, the growthsuppressing activity of TIMP-2 occurs through binding to available a3b1-integrin receptors on endothelial cells. In this scenario, TIMP-2 suppresses endothelial cell responses to transient or minor fluctuations in angiogenic growth factors (VEGF-A and/or FGF-2). However, as the concentrations of these angiogenic factors rise, secondary to tissue hypoxia or other pathologic stimuli, endothelial cells begin to respond through the production of MMPs. The secretion of pro-MMP-2 or active MMPs results in a decrease in local TIMP-2 concentrations as the excess free TIMP-2 binds to these proteases. TIMP-2 binding to secreted MMPs might function to limit matrix degradation and/or enhance pro-MMP-2 activation. As recently demonstrated, endothelial cells responding to angiogenic factors, such as VEGF-A, decrease the synthesis and secretion of TIMP-2 [43]. This further promotes the local decline in TIMP-2 concentrations and potentiates the proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Thus, in this model, TIMP-2 functions as a rheostat by influencing cellular responsiveness to stimuli, leading to cellular proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling.

TIMP-2 maintains tissue homeostasis by first suppressing proliferation in response to angiogenic factors in quiescent tissues, and by suppressing protease activity in those tissues undergoing extracellular-matrix remodeling. The question then arises: if TIMP-2 functions to maintain tissue homeostasis, why do TIMP-2-deficient mice reproduce normally and show no overt phenotype? With respect to vascular development in mammals, we know that this process is regulated in a fashion distinct from angiogenesis in the adult. Vascular development occurs through the process of vasculogenesis, which is functionally distinct from angiogenesis [44]. We propose that either: (i) TIMP-2 has no direct role in vasculogenesis; or (ii) that other members of the TIMP family compensate for the loss of TIMP-2 MMP inhibitory activity during embryonic vascular development. Although no developmental defects are observed in TIMP-2-deficient mice [45,46], a recent report demonstrates that in zebrafish, the single TIMP expressed during development is most homologous to TIMP-2 and that ablation of TIMP-2 expression results in abnormal zebrafish development [14]. This finding suggests that in mammalian systems, other TIMPs might compensate for the loss of TIMP-2 function. Angiogenesis, however, is a process limited to adult tissues responding to a pathologic stimulus. Therefore, the question should be: do TIMP-2-deficient animals have normal or abnormal angiogenic responses to tissue injury? To our knowledge, such experiments have not been reported. Implications and future directions These recent findings have several important clinical implications for cancer therapy. The development of synthetic MMP inhibitors for the treatment of cancer was based, at least in part, on the demonstration that endogenous MMP inhibitors, such as TIMP-2 and other TIMPs, inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in murine tumor models. The underlying assumption in these

Figure 2. TIMP-2 controls cell behavior directly through a3b1-integrin receptors and indirectly by modulating the activity of MMPs. In physiological quiescent states, high levels of free TIMP-2 regulate the activation of angiogenic factor receptors (FGFR-1 or VEGFR-2), through binding to a3b1 integrin, and the subsequent activation of Shp-1 (green) activity. This occurs independently of MMP inhibitory action. As local concentrations of angiogenic factors increase, endothelial cells respond by increasing MMP production and limiting TIMP-2 expression (a). Increasing concentrations of activated MMPs acts as a sink to reduce free-TIMP-2 concentrations (b), limiting the interaction of TIMP-2 with a3b1, thus reducing the growth inhibitory effects. As active MMP concentrations continue to increase, TIMP-2 concentrations might be insufficient to completely inhibit MMP activity. At low concentrations, TIMP-2 is insufficient to inhibit MMP activity and actually enhances MMP-2 activation (through an MT1-MMP-dependent mechanism) resulting in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix, facilitating angio-invasion.

experiments was that the principal activity of the TIMPs was the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity required for tumor invasion, angiogenesis and tumor growth. Unfortunately, these synthetic MMP inhibitors worked well in animal models of cancer progression, but have proved extremely disappointing in clinical trials of patients with cancer [4]. However, as described above, our recent work suggests that the principal anti-angiogenic activity of TIMP-2 is independent of MMP inhibitory activity and is mediated by the activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase activity [7]. Furthermore, the work of Fernandez et al. [42] shows that the MMP inhibitor activity and anti-angiogenic activity (the inhibition of endothelial cell growth) reside in distinct domains within the TIMP-2 molecule. Together, these reports suggest that it will be possible to develop novel anti-angiogenic therapies based on peptide fragments or analogues of TIMP-2. The screening of TIMP-2 peptides for binding to a3b1 and the demonstration that these peptide fragments inhibit endothelial cell growth in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo are already underway.

regulation of cell growth. However, we are now beginning to develop the experimental evidence to define the mechanisms of such activities. The question remains: do other TIMPs also have cell-surface receptors that might mediate the regulation of cell growth or differentiation? TIMP-3 has been shown to bind to VEGFR-2 and function as an antagonist of VEGF-A stimulation [25]. Cell-surface binding for TIMP-1 and TIMP-4 has been reported, but the identification of specific cell-surface receptors has not been forthcoming. The identification of these putative receptors and understanding the signaling mechanisms involved will identify new therapeutic targets, just as TIMP-2-related regulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases is an important target for angiogenesis. Further understanding of such mechanisms will hopefully lead to novel therapeutic strategies for chronic diseases.
