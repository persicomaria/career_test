TCR repertoire diversity has been convincingly shown to facilitate responsiveness of CD8 T cell populations to mutant virus peptides, thereby safeguarding against viral escape. However, the impact of repertoire diversity on the functionality of the CD8 T cell response to cognate peptide-MHC class I complex (pMHC) recognition remains unclear. Here, we have compared TCR chain repertoires of three influenza A epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses in C57BL/6 (B6) mice: DbNP366 ­374, DbPA224 ­233, and a recently described epitope derived from the 1 reading frame of the influenza viral polymerase B subunit (residues 62­70) (DbPB1F262). Corresponding to the relative antigenicity of the respective pMHCs, and irrespective of the location of prominent residues, the DbPA224- and DbPB1-F262-specific repertoires were similarly diverse, whereas the DbNP366 population was substantially narrower. Importantly, parallel analysis of response magnitude, cytotoxicity, TCR avidity, and cytokine production for the three epitope-specific responses revealed no obvious functional advantage conferred by increased T cell repertoire diversity. Thus, whereas a diverse repertoire may be important for recognition of epitope variants, its effect on the response to cognate pMHC recognition appears minimal.

T cells (6). As such, the functionality of diverse as opposed to narrow epitope-specific CTL populations remains uncertain. Here, we have used the B6 mouse model of influenza A virus infection to compare CD8 TCR repertoires specific for three influenza A epitopes: DbNP366, DbPA224, and a recently described epitope derived from the 1 reading frame of the influenza viral polymerase B subunit (residues 62­70) (DbPB1F262). Multiple features of these epitope-specific responses were analyzed after influenza virus infection, including magnitude, cytotoxicity, cytokine profile, and TCR avidity, and correlated with the degree of CTL repertoire diversity. Interestingly, the vast majority of functional correlates analyzed were able to vary independently of the nature of the repertoire, demonstrating no obvious functional advantage of enhanced TCR repertoire diversity on the response to cognate epitope recognition by CTL.

efense against a broad range of invading pathogens, while at the same time protecting the host from immunemediated damage, necessitates a naive T cell compartment exhibiting both exquisite specificity and substantial diversity in TCR usage. Certainly, several studies in which naive T cell diversity has been narrowed, either by means of naturally occurring mutations or introduction of transgenes, have shown deficiencies in the ability of these populations to respond in vivo compared with naturally diverse TCR repertoires (1, 2). Given that a naive repertoire of sufficient diversity is required to generate a detectable T cell response, it is of considerable interest to ascertain whether TCR diversity within epitopespecific populations confers any specific advantage on the T cell response. To date, attempts to address this question have largely focused on the comparative abilities of diverse and narrow CTL repertoires to respond to epitope variants, as occurs during viral escape after chronic infection with viruses such as SIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (3, 4). The findings strongly suggest that enhanced TCR diversity within viral epitope-specific CTL populations prevents the appearance of escape mutants, presumably because of inherent cross-reactivity within CTL recognition (5). Thus, whereas a diverse CTL repertoire seems to be critical for recognition of different, yet closely related epitopes, the effect of TCR diversity on the outcome of cognate epitope recognition is relatively poorly studied, with only one study indicating that a more diverse T cell repertoire may be enriched for higher avidity

epitope (7) and, as yet, is poorly characterized. As an initial characterization, the crystal structure of the DbPB1-F262 complex was solved to 2.6 Å resolution and compared with the previously published DbPA224 (8) and DbNP366 structures (9) (Fig. 1 A and B) (supporting information (SI) Table 2). The electron density for the bound PB1-F262 peptide and the residues within the cleft contacting the peptide was unambiguous. The PB1-F262 peptide presents a surface that is dominated by the highly solvent exposed, positively charged side chain of the P4-Arg and was observed to display a degree of mobility within the cleft. The importance of this residue for T cell recognition was verified by the failure of PB1-F262-specific splenocytes to respond to ex vivo stimulation with a mutant peptide in which the Arg at position 4 was mutated to Ala (data not shown). The DbPA224 complex presents a similarly featured surface dominated by the solvent exposed P7-Arg (Fig. 1 A and B). In contrast, the solvent exposed P4-Glu, P6-Met and P7-Glu side-chains of the DbNP366 epitope are orientated toward the MHC helices to present an essentially flat, featureless surface (8). Therefore, the PB1-F262 peptide can be considered to present a surface with a similar degree of antigenic prominence as PA224 although, unlike the PA224

Data are summarized in a pie chart where each slice of the pie represents the mean proportion of CD8 DbPB1-F262 cells (n 4) expressing a particular TCR V SD (A). Individual CD8 V 6 DbPB1-F262 cells were sorted and RT-nested PCR performed with V 6-specific oligonucleotide primers, and the CDR3 sequenced as described in Materials and Methods.

tures both share a prominent arginine residue, albeit at different peptide positions (P7 and P4, respectively) (Fig. 1 A and B), it was of interest to assess the nature of the DbPB1-F262 repertoire, in particular whether DbPB1-F262 selects the type of diverse TCR repertoire that has been described for the DbPA224-specific response (10). Flow cytometric analysis of V usage in the DbPB1-F262-specific CTL population, from splenocytes taken at the acute phase of the primary response to infection, revealed a dominant bias toward V 6 that was present on 40% of all DbPB1-F262-specific T cells (Fig. 2A). Detailed characterization of the DbPB1-F262-specific repertoire was thus focused on this V 6 population. TCR sequencing was performed on individual CD8 V 6 DbPB1-F262 cells sorted from splenocytes of mice at the acute primary or secondary phase of influenza virus infection. The vast majority (79%) of DbPB1-F262-specific clonotypes (making up 85% of clones) identified across all mice from both time points exhibited a highly conserved glycine residue at position 3 of the CDR3 region (SI Table 3). Furthermore, unlike the DbNP366-and DbPA224-specific repertoires, in which the J 2.2 and J 1.1/2.6 biases constitute 95% and 80%, respectively (11), there did not seem to be a comparable dominance of particular J segments in the DbPB1-F262 repertoire (Fig. 2B). Analysis of clonotype diversity and sharing between individuals in the V 6 DbPB1-F262-specific repertoires is summarized and compared with that of the DbNP366- and DbPA224-specific sets in Table 1. Examining total sequences from all individuals as well as within individuals, both the DbPA224- and DbPB1F262-specific repertoires are significantly more diverse than the DbNP366-specific set. The DbPB1-F262-specific repertoire is sigLa Gruta et al.

nificantly, although not to a great extent, narrower than DbPA224-specific set overall, but diversity is similar within individuals. Thus, the diversity of the DbPB1-F262- and DbPA224specific sets seems similarly broad and is significantly greater than in the limited DbNP366-specific repertoire (Table 1). Analysis of clonotype sharing between individuals was performed to determine the presence of selective pressures on the repertoires exerted either at the level of the individual or on the overall population. Interestingly, whereas the proportion of shared clonotypes in the DbPB1-F262 repertoire was intermediate between DbNP366 and DbPA224 (2.2%, compared with 5.6% and 1.0%, respectively), the proportion of the total response (clones) that was shared for DbPB1-F262 was similar to DbPA224 and significantly less than DbNP366 (Table 1). Thus, presumably because of enhanced diversity, DbPB1-F262 and DbPA224 repertoires exhibit significantly reduced clonotype sharing, and those clonotypes that are shared are not necessarily heavily represented in all mice (as they are for DbNP366).

Repertoire Diversity Does Not Confer a Numerical Advantage on Epitope-Specific CTL Responses. Given that analysis of the DbPB1-

F262-specific CD8 T cell response has, to date, been limited to the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for peptidespecific IFN- production (7, 12), we directly assessed the magnitude of this response by specific tetramer binding. Tetramer staining of splenic DbPB1-F262-specific cells at acute and memory phases of the primary response revealed a subdominant response magnitude that was substantially reduced compared with DbNP366- and DbPA224-specific responses (Fig. 3 A and B). In the acute population recovered from the pneumonic lung by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), whereas the magnitude of the DbPB1-F262-specific population was smallest, it was not significantly different from the other responses analyzed (Fig. 3D).

After secondary challenge, the splenic DbPB1-F262-specific population was similar in size to the DbPA224-specific response, in both spleen and BAL, where the DbNP366-specific response dominates (13, 14) (Fig. 3 C and E). Thus, after both primary and secondary influenza infection, and in contrast to what might be expected from a TCR repertoire comprising multiple clonotypes, the D bPB1-F2 62-specific response is subdominant, whereas the heavily restricted DbNP366-specific repertoire is significantly larger.

Analysis of TNF- production by DbPB1-F262-specific cells revealed, in both spleen and BAL at all time points, a profile similar to that seen in the DbPA224specific population, with a significantly larger percentage of TNF- producers relative to the DbNP366-specific set (Fig. 3 F­I). Conversely, the proportion of DbPB1-F262-specific cells producing IL-2 was, broadly speaking, lower than in the DbPA224-specific set, and more characteristic of the DbNP366specific population (Fig. 3 J­M).

hallmark of an efficient CD8 T cell response. The cytotoxicity of DbPB1-F262-specific cells for peptide pulsed EL4 targets was compared with DbNP366-and DbPA224-specific cells directly ex vivo 10 days after primary intranasal (i.n.) infection. Importantly, equivalent numbers of DbPB1-F262, DbNP366-, and DbPA224-specific effectors were used in the assay after enumeration by tetramer staining combined with splenocyte counts. Interestingly, DbPB1-F262-specific cells were significantly less cytotoxic than either DbNP366- or DbPA224-specific cells (Fig. 4A), which showed similar cytotoxic potential at an individual cell level. Thus, whereas the cytotoxicity of DbPB1-F262-specific cells correlated with their position in the immunodominance hierarchy, there was no apparent effect of repertoire diversity on cytotoxic potential. One might anticipate that, generally, a broad TCR repertoire is better able to bind specific pMHC complexes with higher avidity than a restricted repertoire (6). We were particularly interested in determining whether the similarly diverse repertoire characteristics of the DbPB1-F262 and DbPA224-specific populations translated into similarities in TCR avidity. Dissociation of the DbPB1-F262 tetramer, on populations isolated after primary virus infection, occurred at a rate that was significantly faster than the DbPA224-specific set, and similar to that observed for the DbNP366-specific population (Fig. 4B). Virtually identical results were obtained after secondary viral infection (data not shown). These results suggest that the DbPB1-F262-specific population is relatively low avidity, indicating that broad repertoire diversity is not

sufficient to confer increased avidity on the responding population. Discussion TCR diversity within T cell repertoires is generally considered to be advantageous, facilitating responsiveness to multiple antigenically distinct pathogens (15). At the level of epitopespecific CD8 T cell responses however, investigation into TCR repertoire diversity has largely focused on the value of diversity in mediating recognition of escape mutants (3, 4). Whereas this work is clearly of great importance, it provides no information on how TCR diversity inf luences the quality of the cognate response to pMHC. The aim of this study, therefore, was to ascertain whether the diversity of an epitopespecific T cell repertoire is linked to its functionality in the context of cognate pMHC recognition. To this end, we have characterized TCR diversity and functionality in the DbPB1F262-specific CD8 T cell population, and compared features of this response to those of the previously characterized DbNP366 and DbPA224-specific populations. We demonstrate that the DbPB1-F262 complex exhibits a relatively featured topology and thus induces a dominant TCR repertoire characterized by extensive diversity and relatively little clonotype sharing (8, 10). Whereas similar to DbPA224 in this regard, the DbPB1-F262-specific population exhibited distinct functional properties, including reductions in response magnitude, cytotoxicity, IL-2 production, and TCR avidity. Thus, whereas the

relationship between pMHC structure and TCR repertoire diversity was confirmed in this study, the functionality of such repertoires seems variable and unrelated to the degree of TCR diversity. Previous reports have demonstrated that TCR repertoire diversity is influenced by the structural complexity of the pMHC structure being recognized (8, 16, 17). This finding has been comprehensively demonstrated in the influenza system where the antigenic structures of two Db-restricted peptides, DbNP366and DbPA224, were found to differ markedly, corresponding to substantial differences in the relative diversities of the responding T cell repertoires (8, 10, 16, 18). Consistent with these reports, the DbPB1-F262 structure revealed a relatively prominent P4 arginine, and this antigenic profile was reflected in a DbPB1-F262-specific TCR repertoire with a similarly broad TCR repertoire diversity to that observed for DbPA224-specific CTL responses. This observation was particularly interesting as the prominent residue in the DbPB1-F262 complex was situated further toward the amino terminus than that of DbPA224. Thus, it seems that the degree, rather than the location, of antigenic prominence is critical in determining the diversity of the TCR repertoire. It should be noted, however, despite similarities in diversity, that the DbPB1-F262-specific TCR repertoire was qualitatively distinct from the DbPA224 repertoire, exhibiting a unique V bias, a conserved glycine motif at position 3 of the CDR3, and no obvious J preference. Thus, the effects of antigenic prominence in this system seem limited to repertoire diversity. Diverse TCR repertoires have been shown to be advantageous in the cross-reactive CTL response to heterologous infections (5), as well as in preventing the emergence of viral escape mutants (3, 4). It seems intuitive that a more diverse T cell repertoire might be advantageous for recognition of different, yet closely related, epitopes. But does a diverse repertoire confer any functional advantage in the response to cognate antigen? The clonotypic diversity of an epitope-specific T cell repertoire may be expected to reflect the number of available T cell precursors in the naive repertoire (19). Despite this observation, the DbPB1-F262-specific response, while comprising a highly diverse repertoire compared with DbNP366, is subdominant after primary infection. Furthermore, the extremely restricted DbNP366-specific population is codominant in the primary response. Thus, T cell diversity does not seem to be a good predictor of response magnitude. It remains a possibility, however, that repertoire diversity does accurately reflect precursor frequency, but that after virus infection, epitope abundance may compensate for, or overwhelm, the effects of precursor frequency on response magnitude (14). Indeed, unlike NP and PB1, PB1-F2 is not incorporated in the forming virions and it is not required for virus production (7, 20). Furthermore, the PB1-F2 protein has a relatively short half-life (7). It is possible that these factors may combine to result in the later and more limited cell-surface expression of DbPB1-F262, which could in turn drive less cycling in the responding T cells. Indeed, early viral clearance after secondary infection results in the failure of PB1-F2specific cells to maximally expand (21). This possibility is conjecture however, and the extent and kinetics of DbPB1-F262 presentation are yet to be tested. Ex vivo cytotoxicity, a definitive measure of CTL function, also showed no correlation with repertoire diversity for the epitope-specific responses analyzed. Moreover, the cytotoxic potential of the three populations was not reflected in their respective TCR dissociation rates, suggesting that factors other than T cell diversity and TCR avidity are influencing cytotoxicity in this system. The subdominant nature of the DbPB1-F262specific response and its reduced cytotoxicity may both be a consequence of reduced expansion of DbPB1-F262-specific cells.

toxic potential, measured by perforin and granzyme mRNA profiles, is directly related to cell division (M. R. Jenkins, P.C.D., and S.J.T., unpublished results). Assessing functionality by means of cytokine production showed that DbPB1-F262 had a similarly high proportion of TNF- producers as the DbPA224-specific set, yet a low proportion of IL-2 producers, more like the DbNP366-specific population. This previously uncharacterized finding of an influenza epitope-specific response showing disparate relative abundance of TNF- - and IL-2-producing cells suggests a possible link between TNF- production and repertoire diversity. The lack of any other functional correlate of repertoire diversity, however, suggests that this link may be coincidental. The production of IL-2, however, seems to remain a correlate of avidity for all five of the epitope-specific responses analyzed to date (22, 23). The mechanism by which highly avid epitopes may specifically stimulate IL-2 production versus other cytokines remains unknown and is a promising topic for future investigation. There is evidence that the ability to produce multiple cytokines, and IL-2 in particular, correlates with the persistence of epitope-specific cells into the memory phase (23, 24), as well as with protection against Leishmania major infection in mice (25). Similarly, high avidity T cell populations have also been shown to be enriched in some memory populations (26, 27) and to exhibit enhanced functionality (28­30). This work leads us to consider the feature of the CTL response thought most likely to correlate with TCR repertoire diversity, TCR avidity. It has been suggested that diverse, rather than restricted, populations are more efficient at clearance of herpes simplex virus (6). It was proposed that such efficacy was a consequence of diverse repertoires being more likely than narrow repertoires to contain high avidity CTL. Interestingly, our studies revealed no consistent correlation between TCR avidity and diversity, with the diverse DbPB1-F262-specific population exhibiting a similarly low avidity as the narrow DbNP366 set. Thus, if high avidity T cell populations are indeed functionally desirable, as has been indicated in studies of tumor and virus clearance (28­30), then our results suggest that increasing TCR diversity is not necessarily an efficient mode of generating such a population. In conclusion, the global analysis performed here has strengthened the link between pMHC structure and TCR repertoire diversity. However, whereas other studies have demonstrated the benefits of a broad TCR repertoire for preventing immune escape or for promoting cross-reactivity during heterologous infection, there is no evidence from this study that such repertoires are functionally advantageous in response to the cognate pMHC in the context of viral infection. Therefore, vaccine strategies to enhance functional responsiveness to virus peptides should avoid simply focusing on diversification of the TCR repertoire. Furthermore, with few exceptions, most features of the CD8 T cell response to viral infection studied here are able to vary independently of each other, and as such may be primarily determined by the environment encountered during T cell stimulation. Materials and Methods
Mice and Tissue Harvesting. The female B6 (H2b) mice used in this study were bred and housed in the animal facility of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Melbourne. All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the University of Melbourne Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee. Naive 6- to 8-week-old mice were either infected i.n. with 1 104 pfu of the HKx31 (x31) influenza A virus for analysis of the primary response, or primed i.p. with 1.5 107 pfu of the A/PR8/34 (PR8) influenza A virus at least 6 weeks before secondary i.n. HKx31 challenge. The PR8 and HKx31 viruses express different surface hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) glycoproteins (H1N1 and H3N2, respectively), but share the PR8 internal components. Single cell preparations of spleen were enriched for

CD8 cells by panning for 1h at 37°C on plates coated with a mixture of anti-mouse IgG/IgM (The Jackson Laboratory). Lymphocytes were obtained from the lung by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and adherent cells were removed by incubating on plastic for 1 h at 37°C. Tetramer and Antibody Staining. Epitope-specific CD8 T cells were identified by using tetrameric complexes of the influenza virus H-2Db MHC class I glycoprotein and the NP366 ­374 (ASNENMETM), PA224 ­233 (SSLENFRAYV), or PB1-F262­70 (LSLRNPILV) peptides. Enriched cells were incubated with DbNP366-PE, DbPA224--PE, or DbPB1-F262-PE tetramers for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and stained with anti-CD8 -FITC. Alternatively, tetramer stained cells were stained with anti-CD8 -APC and one of a panel of FITC-conjugated TCR V -specific antibodies (all antibodies purchased from PharMingen unless otherwise stated). Cells were washed, and the staining profiles were analyzed by using a BD FACSCalibur. Tetramer Dissociation Kinetics. An established protocol was used to measure tetramer dissociation kinetics (23, 31). Briefly, after tetramer staining, cells were incubated at 37°C with the 28-14-8 mAb to H2Db (50 g/ml) for various times to prevent tetramer rebinding. Cells were then stained with anti-CD8 FITC, and residual tetramer staining was analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur using CellQuest software. Stimulation and Intracellular Cytokine Staining. Stimulation and intracellular cytokine staining of lymphocyte populations has been described (23). Briefly, enriched lymphocytes from spleen and BAL were stimulated in vitro for 5 h with 10 units/ml IL-2 in the presence or absence of 1 M peptide. They were then stained for cell surface expression of CD8 , and intracellular expression of IFN- , TNF- , and IL-2, and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Ex Vivo 51Cr Release Cytotoxicity Assay. Analysis of ex vivo cytotoxicity of splenocytes harvested from mice 10 days after primary i.n. infection was performed as described in ref. 32. Briefly, 51Cr-labeled target cells pulsed with 1 M NP366, PA224, or PB1-F262 peptides (or left unpulsed) were incubated with effectors at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 4 h. Supernatants (50 l) were harvested, and the percentage of specific 51Cr release was calculated.
Analysis of DbPB1-F262-Specific V T Cell Repertoires. Individual CD8 V 6 DbPB1F262 cells were sorted from splenocytes harvested at the acute primary (day 10) or secondary (day 8) time point, and total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was performed as described in ref. 10, and a nested PCR strategy (8, 10, 18) was used to amplify V 6 cDNA using the following oligonucleotide primers: first round-V 6 ext, 5 -CAGACACCCAAATTCCTGATTGGTC-3 and C a, 5 CCAGAAGGTAGCAGAGACCC-3 ; second round-V 6 int, 5 -GCTATGATGCGTCTCGAGAGAAGAAGTC-3 and C b, 5 -CTTGGGTGGAGTCACATTTCTC3 . Second round V PCR products were then purified by using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), sequenced by using 3.2 pmol of the V 6 int primer, and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3700 sequence analyzer. Repertoire Analysis Statistics. As detailed in SI Text, a variety of statistical approaches have been used to describe species diversity and the amount of shared sequences between different mice (33­36). Protein Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Determination. The recombinant DbPB1-F262 complex was refolded and purified as described in ref. 37. Crystals of the DbPB1-F262 epitope, which belong to space group P43212, were obtained essentially as described in ref. 8. A 2.6-Å dataset was collected and processed and scaled by using the HKL package (HKL Research, Charlottesville, NC) (38). A summary of the data collection is found in SI Table 2. The structure of DbPB1-F262 was solved by using the coordinates of DbPA224 (minus the peptide and water molecules) as a starting model for rigid body refinement as implemented in CNS. The progress of refinement was monitored by the Rfree value (7% of the data) with neither a sigma, nor a low-resolution cut-off being applied to the data. The structure was refined initially by using the simulated annealing protocol implemented in CNS (version 1.0) (39), followed by TLSrefinement in REFMAC. Tightly restrained individual B-factor refinement was used, and bulk solvent corrections were applied to the dataset (SI Table 2). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank Daniel Barr and Drs.
