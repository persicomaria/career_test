Recombinant deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) deaminase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was produced in Escherichia coli and purified. The enzyme proved to be a bifunctional dCTP deaminase:deoxyuridine triphosphatase. As such, the M. tuberculosis enzyme is the second bifunctional enzyme to be characterised and provides evidence for bifunctionality of dCTP deaminase occurring outside the Archaea kingdom. A steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that the affinity for dCTP and deoxyuridine triphosphate as substrates for the synthesis of deoxyuridine monophosphate were very similar, a result that contrasts that obtained previously for the archaean Methanocaldococcus jannaschii enzyme, which showed approximately 10-fold lower affinity for deoxyuridine triphosphate than for dCTP. The crystal structures of the enzyme in complex with the inhibitor, thymidine triphosphate, and the apo form have been solved. Comparison of the two shows that upon binding of thymidine triphosphate, the disordered C-terminal arranges as a lid covering the active site, and the enzyme adapts an inactive conformation as a result of structural changes in the active site. In the inactive conformation dephosphorylation cannot take place due to the absence of a water molecule otherwise hydrogen-bonded to O2 of the -phosphate.

Introduction
The de novo synthesis of deoxyribonucleotides is carried out by a single enzyme, the ribonucleotide reductase.1,2 This multisubstrate enzyme reduces all four common ribonucleotides, cytidine diphosphate (CDP), uridine diphosphate (UDP), guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at the 2 position of the ribosyl moiety.2,3 As the central enzyme in DNA precursor formation, the ribonucleotide reductase features a highly

555 from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv in an E. coli expression vector. The resultant recombinant protein proved to be a bifunctional dCTP deaminase: dUTPase, the first to demonstrate this enzyme activity outside the archaea kingdom. Furthermore, we have solved the crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with dTTP and are able to demonstrate how the bifunctional enzyme that also hydrolyses dUTP can bind dTTP to the active site without hydrolysing this regulatory nucleotide.

sophisticated regulatory mechanism that serves to balance the deoxyribonucleotide pools so that both supply and fidelity of the DNA synthesis is maintained.4­8 However, the DNA-specific pyrimidine nucleotide, thymidine monophosphate, is synthesised by a branching pathway that methylates deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) at the 5 position, a reaction performed by thymidylate synthase.9 Ribonucleotide reductase is, however, not very efficient in providing deoxyuridine diphosphate needed for dUMP and, subsequently, thymidine monophosphate synthesis.5 To circumvent this problem dUMP is obtained mainly (50­70%) by deamination of a cytosine deoxyribonucleotide.10­12 In the Gram-negative bacteria Salmonella typhimurium11 and Escherichia coli,13 dUMP is derived from deamination of deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) by dCTP deaminase to deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) that in turn becomes hydrolysed to dUMP and diphosphate by deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase). In eukaryotes and most Gram-positive bacteria, a zinc-containing enzyme, deoxycytidylic acid deaminase, which is stucturally related to cytosine and cytidine deaminase, directly produces dUMP.14 The dCTP deaminase is one of three members of a structural and functional family of enzymes15 that includes trimeric dUTPase and the newly discovered bifunctional dCTPdeaminase: dUTPase first identified in the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.16,17 The bifunctional enzyme catalyses both the deamination and the triphosphate hydrolysis reaction directly producing dUMP from dCTP.16,17 In this way the potential accumulation of the toxic intermediate dUTP is avoided. In agreement with dCTP deaminase being the entry point in a pathway leading from dCTP to thymidine triphosphate (dTTP) and the role of the latter nucleotide in feed-forward stimulation of GDP reduction by ribonucleotide reductase,4 dCTP deaminase is itself regulated by dTTP, which inhibits the enzyme.18,19 The bifunctional enzyme is also known to be regulated by dTTP.16,17 As mentioned, the bifunctional dCTP deaminase: dUTPase has so far been identified only in archaea. In this work we have cloned the dcd reading frame

Results and Discussion
Verification of bifunctionality and enzyme kinetic analysis of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase The result of following the dCTP deaminase: dUTPase reaction over a period of 45 min by two different assays and at two different enzyme concentrations are shown in Fig. 1a and b. dCTP deamination determined as a decrease in absorbance and the conversion of tritium-labelled dCTP to dUMP clearly identifies the M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase as a bifunctional enzyme where the product of the reaction, dUMP, is formed at the same rate as that by which dCTP is deaminated. As also found for the bifunctional M. jannaschii enzyme,16 dUMP can be formed from both dCTP and dUTP because the bifunctional enzymes are also dUTPases. Data obtained from steady-state kinetics where the concentration of dCTP were varied and analysed by fitting to Eq. (1) (see Materials and Methods) yielded a kcat of 0.18 ± 0.02 s- 1, an S0.5 of 93 ± 17 M and a Hill coefficient, n, of 1.6 ± 0.3. Similarly, with dUTP as a substrate we found a kcat of 0.33 ± 0.02 s- 1, an S0.5 of 73 ± 9 M and an n of 1.4 ± 0.2. The kcat for the dUTPase reaction is about twice that of the combined reactions, indicating that the deamination reaction is rate limiting in the overall formation of dUMP from dCTP. The steadystate kinetic parameters listed above for the bifunctional reaction with dCTP as a substrate are very

556 similar to those for the M. jannaschii enzyme.16 However, for the M. tuberculosis enzyme, the affinity for dUTP, as judged from the value of S0.5, is comparable to that for dCTP, whereas for the bifunctional M. jannaschii enzyme it was in the millimolar range.16 This makes the M. tuberculosis enzyme the better dUTPase of the two bifunctional enzymes, but still the affinity for dUTP is between 10- and 100-fold less than that observed with monofunctional trimeric dUTPases.20,21 In Fig. 2a and b, the results are shown from varying the concentration of dCTP or dUTP in the presence of the inhibitor dTTP. Apparently, dTTP inhibits both the combined reaction and the dUTPase reaction of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase: dUTPase. dTTP inhibition has also been reported previously for the deaminase reaction of the bifunctional enzyme from M. jannaschii and was suggested to be the effect of simple competition with substrate for binding to the active site.16 In the case of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase, dTTP inhibition resembles a noncompetitive mechanism where an increase in substrate concentration cannot fully relieve the dTTP inhibition. The structure of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase Like the other members of the enzyme family mentioned above, dCTP deaminase:dUTPase is a homotrimeric enzyme. The structure of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase­dTTP complex was solved with two subunits (A and B) in the asymmetric unit, which can be superposed with rmsd values of 0.22 Å for C atoms or 0.39 Å for all atoms. The 3-fold crystallographic symmetry generates two independent homotrimers of A and B subunits, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). Each subunit of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase is composed of 13 -strands (1­13), two -helices (1­2) and one 310-helix (1) (Fig. 4a). Assembling the trimer generates three active sites, which is common to the enzyme family. Each active site is located in a pocket between two subunits. In the dTTP complex structure, the C-terminal folds back upon the active site like a lid, rendering the bound nucleotide almost completely shielded from the solvent. The extensive hydrogen-bonding

dTTP Inhibition of dCTP Deaminase:dUTPase

network with the bound nucleotide is seen in Fig. 3c and the 2Fobs - Fcalc electron density map demonstrating the nucleotide is shown in Fig. 3d. Since the active site is composed of residues from neighbouring subunits, residues from one of these are indicated by an asterisk. The pyrimidine moiety forms hydrogen bonds with Arg*106, Gln174, Thr127 and water molecules 51 and 66. Ser*102 is on one side of the pyrimidine plane and on the other side the pyrimidine is stacking with Ile126. The thymidine moiety rests on a hydrophobic surface generated by residues Ile118, Phe122, Ile126, Tyr162 and Tyr171. The deoxyribosyl makes a single hydrogen bond with Asp119. The triphosphate moiety of the nucleotide chelates the magnesium ion that also coordinates to water molecules 60, 65 and 166, generating an octahedral coordination sphere. The triphosphoryl is furthermore hydrogen-bonded to Lys*101, Ser*102, Ser*103, and Gln*148 and the active site lid via Tyr162 and Lys170 as well as water molecules 53, 60, 65 and 116 (Fig. 3c). The structure of the apoenzyme was solved with six subunits (A, B, C, D, E and F) in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the asymmetric unit is that of two homotrimers almost identical with the structure of dCTP deaminase:dUTPase in complex with dTTP. However, as evident from the electron density map, each subunit is missing approximately 30 residues in the C-terminal part of the enzyme. The His112 in subunits A and E was found in the generously allowed region, and Thr114 in all subunits in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The electron density for the peptide bond between Thr114 and Ser113 is somewhat poorer than the average density, which may explain why Thr114 ends up in the disallowed region. Both these residues reside in the active site and rearrange upon binding of dTTP. The subunits of the apoenzyme structure can be superposed with rmsd values of 0.15 to 0.25 Å for C atoms and from 0.50 to 0.62 Å for all atoms. In Fig. 4a, subunit A from the structure of the apoenzyme has been superposed with subunit A from the structure of the enzyme in complex with the inhibitor. Comparing all subunits from the two structures, they can be superposed with rmsd values ranging from 0.97 to 1.03 Å for C atoms and from

560 1.35 to 1.46 Å for all atoms. A major difference between the two structures is the C-terminal that only in the dTTP complex folds back on the enzyme and generates a lid almost covering the binding pocket (Fig. 4a). In the apoenzyme, the C-terminal is disordered. In addition, in the nucleotide-binding site a difference between the two structures is found in the region where the pyrimidine moiety binds (Fig. 4a). A close-up of residues 109­118 from a superposition of the structures of the apo form of the enzyme and the dTTP complex is seen in Fig. 4b. In order to accommodate the 5-methyl group of the thymine moiety, Gly116 is pushed in the C-terminal direction in the dTTP complex. This movement leads to a complete restructuring of the backbone and change in position of the side chains of residues 110 to 117. Specifically, Ala115 moves 2.8 Å towards the -phosphate of dTTP, and Leu110, His112 and Thr114 rearrange at the subunit interface. This conformational change is proposed to downregulate enzyme activity by displacing a key water molecule from the active site, as discussed below. Comparison of the overall structure with that of other family members From Figs. 5a and 6a it is apparent that there is a very high structural and sequential similarity and that the overall fold is almost conserved between the M. tuberculosis and M. jannaschii bifunctional enzymes and the E. coli dCTP deaminase. The central core with distorted -barrel and -helices is common to the structure of all three enzymes. The structural sequence alignment (Fig. 5a) shows that 46 residues are identical within the three structures. Comparing the sequences two by two, M. tuberculosis versus E. coli, M. tuberculosis versus M. jannaschii and E. coli versus M. jannaschii, shows an additional 34, 17 and 14 identical residues, respectively. The M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase appears more closely related to the monofunctional dCTP deaminase from E. coli than to the M. jannaschii bifunctional enzyme. The structural relation of the enzyme family members having dUTPase activity is also evident from a structure-based sequence alignment (Fig. 5b) and a superposition of subunit structures from the bifunctional enzyme in complex with dTTP and dUTPase in complex with ,-imido-dUTP [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 1SIX24], both from M. tuberculosis (Fig. 6b). The main difference is in the C-terminal where in dUTPases it reaches across the

trimer, resulting in an active site composed of residues from all three subunits.24 An intriguing difference between the structures of the dTTP complexes of the M. tuberculosis bifunctional enzyme and the monofunctional E. coli dCTP deaminase is the ordered C-terminal loop that closes over the active site in the M. tuberculosis enzyme. For the E. coli dCTP deaminase, only the dCTP and dUTP complexes and not the dTTP complex display an ordered C-terminal closing over the active site (Fig. 6a).19 As it is reasonable to suggest that the C-terminal will also close over the active site of the M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase when substrate is bound, the binding of any of the three nucleotides dCTP, dUTP or dTTP seems to lead to an ordered C-terminal in this enzyme (Figs. 4a and 6a). Structural comparisons of the active site with that of other enzyme family members When comparing all the examined structures of the enzyme family (Fig. 5a and b) it becomes clear that only six residues, Asp33, Thr84, Ser102, Ile118, Asp119 and Gly124, in the M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase are strictly conserved in primary sequence and in spatial arrangement (results not shown) and all are found in the vicinity of the active site. The hydrophobic surface on which the nucleotide rests is a general feature of the enzyme family members, but only in the bifunctional enzymes are all of the involved residues strictly conserved, while other members contain one or more conservative substitutions. Only Ile118 is strictly conserved in all the examined structures (Fig. 5). Residues that are directly involved in hydrogen bonding to the pyrimidine moiety of the nucleotide, Arg106, Thr127 and Gln174, are conserved in the enzymes with deaminase function, except Thr127, which is substituted by valine in the dCTP deaminase from E. coli (Fig. 5a). A mechanism for the deamination of dCTP has been suggested that involves four residues corresponding to Ser102, Arg106, Ala115 and Glu129.15 All these residues are strictly conserved within the enzymes having dCTP deaminase activity (Fig. 5a). Arg106, Ala115 and Glu129 are not conserved in the dUTPases (Fig. 5b), consistent with no dCTP deaminase activity. A suggested reaction mechanism for the dephosphorylation of dUTP by dUTPases24,25 involves three residues corresponding to Ser102, Asp119 and Gln148 that are all strictly conserved in all dUTPases and the bifunctional enzymes from M. tuberculosis

numbering), which, at least in part, explains the lack of dUTPase activity of E. coli dCTP deaminase.15 In addition to the above observations, a glycine at the position corresponding to Gly116 in M. tuberculosis

dCTP deaminase:dUTPase is conserved among the known bifunctional enzymes and the trimeric dUTPases (Fig. 5a and b). In the E. coli dCTP deaminase this residue is a histidine (His125, E. coli numbering).

dTTP Inhibition of dCTP Deaminase:dUTPase

563 present, is almost invariant (Fig. 8). The conserved residues corresponding to Ser102, Asp119 and Gln148 suggested to catalyse the hydrolysis of the triphosphate in both the dUTPases and the bifunctional enzymes superpose well in all three structures. The water molecule suggested to perform the nucleophilic attack24,25 is also present at the same position in all three structures (indicated by a continuous arrow in Fig. 8). Based on the current models for the catalytic mechanism of dUTPases,24,25 the M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase­dTTP complex should be a competent catalytic complex with the ability to hydrolyse dTTP. As described above, the binding of dTTP to M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase causes a dramatic rearrangement in the position of residues 110­117 to overcome steric hindrance of the 5-methyl group of the thymine moiety. As a result, the methyl group of Ala115 changes its position by 2.8 Å and moves closer to the -phosphoryl of dTTP and hereby pushes a water molecule, Wat 59 (A subunit), aside (Fig. 8). This water molecule is present not only in the structures of the apo form of the M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase structure and the M. tuberculosis dUTPase­,imido dUTP complex as shown in Fig. 8, but also in the majority of dUTPase structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Wat 59 and the corresponding water molecules in dUTPases make a hydrogen bond with O2 of the -phosphoryl and have not previously been included in the description of the catalytic mechanism of dUTPases.24 Wat 59 is held in place by hydrogen bonding to the main-chain carboxyl of Gly100 and the main-chain amides of Gly116 and Phe117 of which Gly116 is the only residue that is fully conserved in enzymes having dUTPase activity (Fig. 5). The fact that the structure of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase in complex with dTTP represents what is best described with the current knowledge as a catalytic complex for cleavage of the triphosphate suggests that a water molecule at the position of Wat 59 in the apo structure is an absolute requirement for the reaction to proceed. Perhaps this water molecule plays a role in stabilizing the transition state by withdrawing electrons from the -phosphoryl, leaving the phosphorous atom more susceptible for nucleophilic attack. When the hydrophobic methyl group of Ala115 points towards O2 of the -phosphoryl (the distance is 3.1 Å), the effect is reversed and electrons push towards the phosphorous atom. Future experiments with both the bifunctional enzyme and dUTPase will address this issue. The dTTP-binding conformation of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase is most likely also able to bind dCTP and dUTP, which might provide an explanation for the observed noncompetitive inhibition by dTTP shown in Fig. 2. Conclusion In this work we have demonstrated the existence of a bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase in a

A structural comparison (not shown) between the E. coli dCTP deaminase (PDB ID 1XS115) and the M. tuberculosis apo dCTP deaminase:dUTPase shows that the histidine side chain would clash with the bulky side chain of residue 97 (Trp106, E. coli numbering). Most likely, the presence of glycine at a position homologous to position 116 in the M. tuberculosis enzyme is a characteristic of bifunctional enzymes and distinguishes these from the monofunctional dCTP deaminases. The mechanism of dTTP regulation of the bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase The dTTP regulation of E. coli dCTP deaminase has recently been shown to involve the transition of the enzyme between two conformations in a concerted mechanism.19 The enzyme is in an active conformation when complexed to dCTP or dUTP and in an inactive conformation when complexed to dTTP. The conformational change is mediated by amino acid residues (121­125, E. coli numbering) situated close to the 3-fold axis in the center of the trimer and the interaction of this region with the additional 5-methyl group of dTTP compared to dCTP and dUTP. The corresponding region in the M. tuberculosis bifunctional enzyme is covered by residues 110­117 (Fig. 4). A structural reorganisation of the nucleotide-binding site to accommodate the 5-methyl group of dTTP changes the position of His112, pushing the side chain of Leu110 backwards. To avoid a clash between Leu110 and Thr114 from the neighbouring subunit the latter residue has to change position, causing the neighbouring subunit to adopt the same conformation as that of the first (Fig. 7), Similar to that found in the E. coli dCTP deaminase,19 these structural changes are mutually exclusive because of steric hindrance and only one of the two conformations can be adopted at the same time within the trimer. The trimeric dUTPases are not regulated by dTTP, most likely because dUTP imposes a danger to the genome if present at high concentrations and therefore should always be removed and converted into dUMP used for dTTP synthesis. As a consequence, the nucleotide-binding site has evolved to only recognise the uracil base, and dUTPases show extremely low affinity for both dCTP and dTTP.20,21 The dCTP deaminase nucleotide-binding site recognises dTTP19 that regulates dCTP deaminase to avoid initiation of dCTP breakdown to dUMP in the presence of excess dTTP. However, the abovedescribed mechanism of dTTP inhibition common to both the monofunctional dCTP deaminase and the bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase (Fig. 2) immediately raises the question: Why is dTTP not hydrolysed when bound to the bifunctional enzyme? A superposition of the active sites from the structures of the M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase: dUTPase­dTTP complex, the M. tuberculosis apodCTP deaminase:dUTPase and M. tuberculosis dUTPase­,-imido dUTP complex (PDB ID 1SIX24) shows that the position of the nucleotides, where

566 ancestor is not a trivial question and will require a study of the genomic data now available. However, the difference in the enzymes and pathways of dTTP biosynthesis in various organisms9­12,16,29 is unusual for the central metabolism, especially when considering the role of the product in DNA synthesis. In addition to demonstrating the existence of a bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase in M. tuberculosis the structural study described in this work raises a question as to the role of an additional water molecule in the catalytic mechanism of not only the bifunctional enzymes, but also the dUTPases. Our results indicate that the reaction mechanism and the role of residues and water molecules in the active site is not yet fully understood. Finally, the therapeutic use of dUTPase inhibitors for treatment of infections as it has been proposed30 of course requires a detailed knowledge of the deoxyribonucleotide metabolism of the targeted organism. Due to the high degree of sequence and structural similarity between species,31 the dUTPase may represent a difficult target for chemotherapy. However, the bifunctional enzyme has a more broad specificity for the pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide and therefore may provide a more flexible target for nucleotide analogs aimed at pathogenic bacteria that encode this enzyme.

dTTP Inhibition of dCTP Deaminase:dUTPase diaminetetraacetic acid and 0.05 M tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (pH 8.0). Lysozyme (1 mg ml- 1) and RNase A (0.1 mg ml- 1) were added and the suspension was heated to 37 °C for 20 min. After lysis, chromosomal DNA was obtained by phenol­chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Quality and final concentration of the DNA was estimated from measurements of the ratio A260 nm/A280 nm. Recombinant expression of the M. tuberculosis dcd gene and purification of the gene product Genomic DNA obtained as described above served as a template for PCR reactions using the Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) according to the supplier's recommendations. PCR products were obtained with the oligodeoxyribonucleotides TB-DCD5-3A; GGAATTCCATATGCTGCTCTCCGATCGTGATCTTCGG and TB-DCD3-5A; CCGGGATCCCTAAGTAGACCTGATGAAGTTCTGG that harbour the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites (shown in italics), respectively, used for cloning the PCR fragment into the expression vector pET11a (Novagen) by using standard DNA techniques and yielding the plasmid pTBdcd7. The DNA sequence of the dcd open reading frame of pTBdcd7 was verified by sequencing with an ABI PRISM 310 DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the supplier's recommendations. A 5-ml overnight culture of BL21(DE3) transformed with pTBdcd7 and grown in NYZ medium with the addition of 100 g ml- 1 ampicillin at 37 °C was used to inoculate 1 l of the same medium under vigorous agitation at 37 °C. When the culture reached an OD436 nm of 0.8, IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM to induce the overexpression of the M. tuberculosis dcd open reading frame. After continued growth for 3 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation in a Sorvall centrifuge using an SLA3000 rotor at 5000 rpm for 8 min. All subsequent steps were conducted at 4 °C. The cells were washed in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and resuspended in 15 ml of the same buffer. The cells were opened by sonication and the debris was sedimented by centrifugation in the Sorvall centrifuge using an SS34 rotor at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. Streptomycin sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1% and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was subsequently dialyzed three times against 500 ml of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. The dialyzed protein sample was loaded onto a 38-ml DEAE 52 column equilibrated with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and mounted on a Gradifac (Amersham Bioscience). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of from 0 to 0.4 M KCl in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, in a total volume of 280 ml. The protein fractions containing M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase were pooled and diluted threefold with 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and passed over the column a second time as described above. The protein fractions containing

Materials and Methods
Materials All buffers, nucleotides, salts and crystallization reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck. Radioactive nucleotides were obtained as ammonium salts from Amersham Biosciences or Moravek. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with polyethyleneiminecoated cellulose plates from Merck. Preparation of chromosomal DNA from M. tuberculosis Extraction of chromosomal DNA from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was done with minor modifications as previously described.32 Briefly, mycobacteria were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) containing 0.05% Tween 80. Filter sterilized D-cycloserine (Sigma-Aldrich, Denmark) was added to cultures in late exponential phase (OD460 nm of 0.6­0.7) to give a final concentration of 1 mg/ ml and the cultures were incubated for an additional 24 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4% SDS, 25% sucrose, 0.05 M ethylene-

Close-up of the active site (ribbon view) from superposition of the apo form of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase (green) and the dTTP complex (pink) with the M. tuberculosis dUTPase­,-imido dUTP complex (orange, PDB ID 1SIX24). From all three structures the side chains corresponding to Ser102, Asp119 and Gln148 are shown as well as Ala115 from the bifunctional enzyme. Nucleotides are presented in ball-and-stick representation and in standard atom colours except carbon, which is coloured according to the matching enzyme. Important water molecules are also shown in colours corresponding to the colour of the matching enzyme. Magnesium ions are grey. The active site is shown from two directions (a and b). A continuous arrow points to the nucleophilic water molecule, while a dotted arrow points to the water molecule that is hydrogenbonded to O2 of the -phosphate in the trimeric dUTPases. See the text for details. The panels were prepared with PyMol (DeLano Scientific).

dTTP Inhibition of dCTP Deaminase:dUTPase M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase were pooled and saturated to 80% with ammonium sulfate. The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation as above and the pellet was dissolved in 5 ml 50 mM Hepes and 2 mM DTT, pH 6.8. Finally, the protein was dialyzed three times against 500 ml 50 mM Hepes and 2 mM DTT, pH 6.8. The deduced primary sequence of dCTP deaminase:dUTPase from M. tuberculosis is composed of 190 amino acid residues corresponding to a molecular mass of 20.9 kDa for each monomer. The purified M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase migrated in SDS-PAGE with an Mr of about 25,000 and showed a purity of more than 95%. The enzyme was stored in aliquots of 150 l at -20 °C where it remained stable for months. The concentration of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm using a 280 of 10.810 cm- 1 M- 1. Enzyme assays and kinetic analysis Enzyme assays based on the conversion of [5-3H]dCTP to [5-3H]dUMP and subsequent separation of reaction products by thin-layer chromatography were conducted at 37 °C as described previously.16 The assay incubations contained 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 2 mM magnesium chloride and 2 mM DTT and varying concentrations of dCTP, dUTP and dTTP as described under Results and Discussion. The progression of dCTP deamination was measured by the decrease in absorbance at 291 nm with an extinction coefficient 291 of 1340 M- 1 cm- 1.33 The

reaction conditions were as described under Results and Discussion and data were recorded at 37 °C every 30 s for 45 min. All enzyme assays were performed twice using two different protein concentrations. Data obtained by varying the dCTP concentration in the presence or absence of dTTP were fitted to the Hill equation [Eq. (1)] using UltraFit, version 3.0 (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). rate ¼ kcat ½Sn =ðSn þ ½Sn Þ 0:5 ð1Þ

where rate is the initial rate with a maximum of kcat, S0.5 is the concentration of the substrate, S, at half-maximal saturation of the enzyme and n is the Hill coefficient. Crystallization of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase Initial screening for crystallization conditions was performed using the E. coli dCTP deaminase crystallization conditions15 as a starting point. In all experiments the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was applied. Crystals of dCTP deaminase:dUTPase in complex with dTTP were grown at 15 °C. A volume of 4 l of enzyme solution containing 1.8 mg/ml enzyme, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dTTP, 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, was mixed with 2 l of reservoir solution, 45% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, 200 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and equilibrated over 1 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals appeared within 1 day and grew to a size of 0.11 mm ×

0.05 mm × 0.05 mm in 4 days. Crystals were harvested and cryocooled and were transferred directly from the crystallization drop to liquid nitrogen. Crystals of apo dCTP deaminase:dUTPase were grown at 4 °C. A volume of 2 l of enzyme solution containing 1.9 mg/ml enzyme and 50 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, was mixed with 2 l of reservoir solution, 20% PEG 8000, 50 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, and equilibrated over 1 ml of reservoir solution. Microcrystals and precipitate appeared after 1 day, and after 6 weeks a few crystals had grown to the size of 0.06 mm × 0.03 mm × 0.03 mm. Crystals were transferred to a cryosolution containing 75% reservoir solution and 25% PEG 400 and cryocooled in liquid nitrogen. Prior to data collection, the crystals were annealed by blocking the cryostream for 5 s. Data collection and processing Diffraction data were collected at the ID14-3 beamline at European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF) (Grenoble, France). The diffraction data were indexed, integrated, scaled and merged using XDS and XSCALE.34 Details on data collection, processing and statistics are presented in Table 1. Protein structure determination and refinement The structure of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase: dUTPase in complex with dTTP was solved by molecular replacement performed with MOLREP35 from the CCP4 program suite36 using a subunit of E. coli dCTP deaminase15 as a search model. A solution was found in space group R32 with two subunits (A and B) per asymmetric unit. Multiple rounds of model building in the A-weighted 2Fobs - Fcalc and Fobs - Fcalc electron density map and subsequent refinement using noncrystallographic symmetry restraints between the two subunits were carried out using the programs WinCoot22 and REFMAC5,37 respectively. In both subunits, residues 1­189 could be modelled and clear density for dTTP coordinated to Mg2+ and three PEG fragments appeared in the model. A total of 169 water molecules were added to the model using the automated ARP/wARP38 procedure in REFMAC5. Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Finally, the model was validated using WHAT IF39 and PROCHECK.40 The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK shows that 89.4% of the residues are found in the most favoured regions, while 10.3% of the residues are in the additional allowed regions; 0.3% of the residues corresponding to one residue, Asn185 (A), are found in the generously allowed regions. The crystal structure of the apo form of M. tuberculosis dCTP deaminase:dUTPase was solved by molecular replacement using subunit A of the dTTP complex as a search model. A solution was found in space group P21 with six subunits (A, B, C, D, E and F) per asymmetric unit. Model building and refinement was carried out as described above. One hundred twenty water molecules and seven PEG fragments could be added to the model during refinement, which was carried out as described above. Refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK showed that 89.7% of the residues are in the most favoured regions, while 9.2% of the residues are found in the additional allowed regions. Of the remaining residues, 0.4% corresponding to Glu59 (subunit F) and His112 (all subunits) are found in the generously allowed regions,
