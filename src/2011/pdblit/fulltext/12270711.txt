The malarial surface antigen apical membrane antigen (AMA1), from Plasmodium falciparum, is a leading candidate for inclusion in a vaccine against malaria. AMA1 is synthesised by mature blood-stages of the parasite and is located initially in the apical organelles of the merozoite. Prior to merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes, it is processed into a 66 kDa type 1 integral membrane protein on the merozoite surface. The pattern of disulphide bonds in AMA1 has been the basis for separation of the ectodomain into three domains, with three, two and three disulphide bonds, respectively. We have determined the solution structure of a 16 kDa construct corresponding to the putative second domain of AMA1. While circular dichroism and hydrodynamic data were consistent with a folded structure for domain II, its NMR spectra were characterised by broad lines and significant peak overlap, more typical of a molten globule. Consistent with this, domain II bound the fluorescent dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS). We have nonetheless determined a structure, which defines the secondary structure elements and global fold. The two disulphide bonds link the N and C-terminal regions of the molecule, which come together to form a four-stranded b-sheet linked to a short helix. A long loop linking the N and C-terminal regions contains four other a-helices, the locations of which are not fixed relative to the b-sheet core, even though they are well-defined locally. Very recently this region of domain II has been shown to contain the epitope recognised by the invasion-inhibitory antibody 4G2, even though it does not contain any of the polymorphisms that are regarded as having arisen in response to the pressure of immune recognition.

parasite Plasmodium falciparum remains one of the world's most serious public health problems. Young children who have not developed protective acquired immune responses to the parasite are particularly susceptible to developing life-threatening disease, with more than one million children dying from malaria each year.1 Consequently, the development of a malaria vaccine that would reduce infant deaths from malaria is a major global public health priority. Proteins on the surface of the merozoite stage of the parasite are attractive candidates for inclusion in a malaria vaccine directed against the asexual blood-stage parasites,2 as they are accessible to plasma antibodies that block parasite invasion of host cells.

642 apical membrane antigen (PfAMA1) is one such molecule, and is a particularly attractive vaccine candidate because it is expressed at both the sporozoite and merozoite stage of the parasite life cycle.3 Immunisation with AMA1 induced protection in both simian and rodent models of the human disease. Recombinant AMA1 expressed using a baculovirus vector induced protection against Plasmodium fragile in Saimiri monkeys4 and Plasmodium chabaudi adami in mice.5 Protection against P. chabaudi was also induced in mice with recombinant AMA1 ectodomain expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in vitro. The disulphide bond-stabilised conformation of the ectodomain was essential for protection, as the antigen was not an effective vaccine after reduction and alkylation.5,6 AMA1 is an 83 kDa antigen synthesised by mature blood-stages of the parasite and located initially in the microneme apical organelle of the merozoite.7­9 Prior to merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes, AMA1 is processed into a 66 kDa product and then released onto the merozoite surface.10,11 The primary structure of AMA1 deduced from its gene sequence is that of a type 1 integral membrane protein.7 The mature protein consists of an N-terminal extracellular domain of about 525 residues, a 23 residue hydrophobic sequence commencing at residue 547, and a smaller C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of 55 residues. AMA1 lacks repetitive sequences that are dominant antigenic epitopes in many malaria antigens. Substantial sequence identity exists among AMA1 proteins of different Plasmodium species.7,12­15 Most notably, 16 Cys residues, which form eight intramolecular disulphide bonds in the ectodomain, are conserved in all sequences (Figure 1). The pattern of disulphide bonds in AMA116 has been the basis for separation of the ectodomain into three domains, with three, two and three disulphide bonds, respectively. Support for this domain substructure has come from the characterisation of AMA1 fragments generated by proteolytic processing that occurs during the process of merozoite release and re-invasion.11 The pairings of six of the eight disulphide bonds were assigned using tryptic digests of P. chabaudi AMA1;16 the remaining two disulphide connectivities in domain III were assigned using a novel approach based on antigenic analysis of mutated forms of this domain expressed using phage display.17 The exact function of AMA1 is unknown, but it appears to be important in orienting the merozoite on the erythrocyte surface prior to invasion.18 Its importance is emphasised by the fact that it has not been possible to obtain targeted disruptions of the AMA1 gene that knocked out its function.19 The majority of individuals living in malariaendemic regions have very high levels of antiAMA1 antibodies.20,21 Adults in Papua New Guinea had antibodies predominantly directed against conserved regions of the molecule, although antibodies directed against polymorphic regions were also widespread, and in some children

represented the majority of antibodies against AMA1.20 Polymorphisms in AMA1 allow parasites to escape the invasion inhibitory activity of antibodies added to in vitro cultures and may prevent an AMA1 vaccine being effective against all P. falciparum AMA1 genotypes.22­24 Domain I is the most polymorphic region of the antigen but diversifying selection, most probably due to protective antibody responses, appears to be operating on domains I and III.21,25 Domain II is a relatively conserved region of AMA1 but may also be a target of protective antibody responses. Lalitha and colleagues26 have shown that it is necessary to include domain II in recombinant fragments of AMA1 in order to induce high levels of invasioninhibiting antibodies. Moreover, antibodies to a peptide from domain II of Babesia bovis AMA1 inhibited invasion of bovine erythrocytes by Babesia merozoites.27 We have determined the solution structure of domain III using NMR spectroscopy.17 The structure has a well-defined disulphide-stabilised core region separated by a disordered loop, with both the N and C-terminal regions also being unstructured. Naturally occurring mutations in domain III that are located far apart in the primary sequence tend to cluster in the region of the disulphide core, and nearly all the polymorphic sites have a high level of solvent accessibility, consistent with their location in epitopes recognised by protective antibodies. Clearly, the structured core is an important element of the antigenic surface of AMA1 recognised by protective antibodies. Here, we have investigated the structure of the putative second domain of AMA1. Even though it expresses in good yield, we have found that domain II in isolation behaves like a molten globule, which is regarded as a state containing native-like secondary structure but loosened or "molten" tertiary structure. Although NMR is unrivalled in its ability to characterise the structure and dynamics of unfolded and partially folded states of proteins,28 molten globules represent a significant challenge for NMR structural characterisation.29 Current estimates by protein sequence analysis and growing experimental evidence suggest that more than 50% of proteins in eukaryotes may contain disordered conformations of 40 residues or more in length, whereas fewer than 1% of the proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contain such long regions.30 The term disordered describes any set of non-rigid conformations of polypeptide chains, including different compact, partially folded conformations, such as molten globules, pre-molten globules, and random coils.31 The molten globule-like behaviour of domain II may be a consequence of its excision from the full-length protein. However, we have pursued the structure determination of this domain not only to define its intrinsic structure but also as a basis for determining how its structure and dynamics might change in full-length AMA1.

Results
Expression, purification and folding An AMA1 domain II construct coding for a 12 residue leader sequence and residues 309­436 of the full-length native protein (Figure 1) was expressed in E. coli. The protein was refolded and purified essentially as described for full-length AMA122 and its purity assessed by reverse-phase (RP) HPLC and time of flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). The recombinant protein was

analysed, along with full-length AMA1, for binding to antibodies in plasma from Papua New Guinean blood donors (pool P)32 (Figure 2). The ability of these antibodies, which recognise predominantly conformational epitopes, to bind to the recombinant protein implies that the protein has the correct disulphide connectivities and a nativelike conformation. However, the domain II construct did not inhibit a significant proportion of human antibodies binding to the full-length ectodomain, in an inhibition ELISA (data not shown). Thus, the domain II construct displays a relatively small proportion of the epitopes

recognised by the naturally occurring anti-AMA1 antibody response. To further confirm native disulphide bond formation in our domain II construct, enzymatic cleavage of domain II with trypsin to generate individual disulphide-linked peptides was performed under slightly acidic conditions (to reduce the potential for disulphide bond interchange). To identify disulphide-linked peptides, analytical RP-HPLC analyses were performed on identical portions of the tryptic digest with and without DTT reduction. A comparison of the two tryptic fingerprints revealed a number of peptide peaks whose chromatographic behaviour changed upon reduction. This tryptic fingerprint was compared with that carried out by Hodder et al. (unpublished results) which had been further analysed by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing. The chromatograms were identical (data not shown), confirming native disulphide linkages in our domain II construct. Solution properties Samples for NMR were prepared in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5), and run at 25 8C unless otherwise noted. Initial 1D and 2D spectra (Figure 3) indicated that many peaks were broader than expected for a 16 kDa protein, raising the question of whether domain II was monomeric under these conditions. We therefore analysed several samples using analytical ultracentrifugation and NMR translational diffusion measurements. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed on a 0.05 mM sample and the results were best fitted by a single species model of molecular mass 14.4 kDa. Although slightly lower than the expected value of 16 kDa, this indicated that domain II was monomeric under these solution conditions. The translational diffusion coefficient is sensitive to both the size and shape of the diffusing species.33 Pulsed field gradient diffusion experiments resulted in values from 1.06!10K10 m2 sK1 to 1.22!10K10 m2 sK1 at 25 8C for eight concentrations spanning the range 0.05 mM to 0.8 mM. This range of concentration extended from the value used for

sedimentation analyses to that used for NMR structure determination. If the protein were aggregated at the higher concentration, the expected change in the self-diffusion coefficient would be 25% for a hard-sphere molecular contact model and 15% for a closely packed coiled-coil model.34 The random fluctuation of !15% in our diffusion measurements is consistent with a monomeric domain II over this entire concentration range.35 Moreover, no obvious changes in line widths and chemical shifts were evident in 1D and 2D NMR spectra over this range of protein concentration. The average value of 1.1!10K10 m2 sK1 for domain II is close to published translational diffusion coefficients for lysozyme (14.1 kDa) and dimeric monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (17.4 kDa),36 indicating that its hydrodynamic properties are similar to those of other globular proteins of similar mass, and therefore that its structure is reasonably compact. Domain II behaves like a molten globule Equilibrium molten globules are formed by many proteins under partially denaturing conditions.37 The conformational heterogeneity and complex dynamics of these species lead to resonance broadening, reduced signal intensity and peak overlap.29,38 Because the NMR spectral properties of PfAMA1 domain II resembled those of a molten globule in several respects, we investigated whether it showed other characteristics of this state. One means of detecting molten globule proteins is by binding of the fluorescent dye 8-anilino-1naphthalene sulphonate (ANS), which interacts with hydrophobic regions of proteins that are exposed due to flexibility of the structure.39 Domain II was found to interact strongly with ANS (Figure 4(a)). Almost no fluorescence emission from ANS or AMA1 domain II was observed in aqueous solution, but a strong emission at 485 nm was detected when they were mixed. This is consistent with observations made for proteins such as a large N-terminal fragment of staphylococcal nuclease,40 bovine carbonic anhydrase B and

techniques (Figure S2; Supplementary Data). Of the possible 122 non-proline backbone amide resonances, 12 were not identified in a 2D 1H­15N HSQC and 3D triple-resonance spectra due to the serious overlap. Five of them were identified from 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra acquired at 800 MHz and 500 MHz using a cryoprobe. Therefore, the final

646 assignments of 1H and 15N backbone resonances were 95% complete excluding proline residues, and 13 C backbone assignments were 90% complete. Assignments of 1H and 13C side-chain resonances were 85% and 70% complete, respectively (Table S1; Supplementary Data). Difficulties in assignments were encountered due to spectral overlap and missing cross-peaks in 13C related spectra. Chemical shift assignments have been submitted to the BMRB database42 under accession code 6510. Chemical shift index (CSI) calculations43 (Figure S3; Supplementary Data) predicted that several regions of ordered secondary structure were present, including three b-strands (H325­I332, N401­F412 and I420­A427) and two a-helices (L344­E349 and E366­I375). These inferences are in good but not perfect agreement with the secondary structure determined from structure calculations (see below). A recent statistical analysis indicated that the mean (absolute) values of chemical shift differences from random coil values decreased regularly with increasing solvent

exposure of secondary structure elements.44 The greater degree of solvent exposure of the helices and b-strands in domain II may account for some of the differences between the CSI analysis and the final structure. A molten globule is expected to retain native-like secondary structure, even though it lacks the unique side-chain interactions that characterise the tertiary structure of the native protein. Analysis of far-UV CD spectra of domain II (Figure 4(b)) using the neural network K2D45 (which is capable of analysing spectra that are not reliable below 190 nm) or on DICHROWEB46 indicated that it contained 11% a-helix, 38% b-sheet and 51% random structure. In general, analyses for b-sheet proteins tend to be far less accurate (50­75%) than for helical proteins. Nonetheless, the secondary structure content inferred from CD spectra is in reasonable agreement with our CSI prediction (12% a-helix, 20% b-sheet and 55% random structure).

647 ° value of 5.5 A over the Ca atoms. However, the local structure from N401­I411, which includes two dimorphic sites (T404 and E405) has a similar antiparallel b-sheet structure to residues N33 to E43 in the 96 residue C-terminal fragment of P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP1),49 the other leading asexual blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate. Unlike domain II, this antiparallel b-sheet structure of PfMSP1 is most likely stabilised by a local disulphide bond (C30­C41) and G38, which favours a type I b-turn, but the sequence identity between N401­S423 of PfAMA1 domain II and N33­N53 of C-terminal Pf MSP1 is 50%. Backbone dynamics Backbone 15N T1, T2 and NOE relaxation parameters were measured for PfAMA1 domain II. After excluding residues heavily overlapped in the spectra, T1, T2 and steady-state 15N­{1H} NOE values were obtained for 46 residues, as summarised in Figure 6. Average values of T1, T2 and NOE for the a-helical region (L344­D348 and L357­K364) and b-sheet region (H325­F329, G400­N403, K408­ I411 and S423­I426) are 0.48(G0.06) s, 0.15(G0.03) s, 0.53(G0.21) and 0.47(G0.10) s, 0.048(G0.008) s, 0.66(G0.09), respectively. Within the structured part of the molecule, the average T2 value over the a-helical region appeared significantly longer than the corresponding T2 value of the b-sheet region. Similarly, lower NOE values were observed for the a-helical region than those of the b-sheet region even though the difference was less pronounced than for the T2 values. As both the 15 N NOE and T2 are sensitive to the motions at the picosecond to nanosecond timescales, this significant increase in T2 together with lower NOE values implies that motions of particular segments such as the a-helices within domain II under the present conditions are on the nanosecond timescale. Interactions between domain II and domain III of PfAMA1 As domain III is a stable, structured domain17 we investigated whether it might interact with domain II, possibly leading to a change in the molten globule properties of the latter. No interaction was observed by isothermal titration calorimetry (Figure S4; Supplementary Data). Possible interactions were also examined by NMR by recording HSQC spectra of 15N-labelled domain II in the presence of a tenfold molar excess of unlabelled domain III, and vice versa. Comparing HSQC spectra of domain II alone and domain II C domain III, four of the well-resolved cross-peaks from backbone amides and two from an Asn side-chain had shifted, but by !0.09 ppm and !0.7 ppm in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively (Figure 7(a)). These correspond to D317 and N319 from the N-terminal loop region, I332 and D333, after the first b-strand, and G436 at the C

were derived from several sources, including an HNHA spectrum and TALOS.47 A final family of 20 structures, determined using simulated annealing in XPLOR-NIH, was chosen on the basis of stereochemistry and lowest energy and is shown in Figure 5(a). Structural statistics for the final family are shown in Table 1. The 12 residues belonging to the vector-derived sequence at the N terminus were unstructured in solution and are not included in further analyses of the structure. A ribbon diagram of the closest-to-average structure is shown in Figure 5(b) to illustrate the secondary structure elements and overall fold. The two disulphide bonds link the N and C-terminal regions of the molecule, which come together to form a four-stranded b-sheet linked to a short helix. The b-sheet consists of H325­F329 (strand 1), G400­ N403 (strand 2), K408­I411 (strand 3) and S423­I426 (strand 4). This sheet is linked to the helix by the C337­C409 disulphide bond. The region containing this b-sheet and the short helix C337­K339 is relatively well defined across all structures in the family (Figure 5(a)). A long loop linking the N and C-terminal regions contains four other a-helices (residues L344­D348, L357­K364, N369­A372 and A384­A387), the locations of which are not fixed relative to the b-sheet core because of a dearth of long-range NOEs, even though they are well defined at the local level. In fact, the helix encompassing L357­K364 is better defined even than the b-sheet, with the average pair-wise RMSD ° value over backbone heavy atoms of 1.25 A. An antiparallel b-sheet around F312 to E321, close to N-terminal and C320­C418 disulphide bond region, appeared in some of the higher energy structures, but was not consistently present in the final 20 lower energy structures. AMA1 sequences from several hundred P. falciparum isolates are now available, and reveal a large number of point mutations, which are thought to reflect the selective pressure of protective immune responses. 24 At the majority of polymorphic sites there is a strict dimorphism, with only two amino acid residues found. At a smaller number of sites, three (eight sites), four (two sites) and eight (one site) residues are found. Analyses of the inhibitory activity of antibodies in vitro and the sequence differences in AMA1 of the parasites studied in these assays indicate that the highly polymorphic (i.e. Odimorphic) sites are particularly important as targets of inhibitory antibodies. Four dimorphic sites that differ between 3D7 and W2meF PfAMA1 (P330, I332, T404 and E405) are located in domain II.23 The location of each of these is shown in Figure 5(b). Interestingly, the polymorphic residues form a cluster in the relatively well defined core region. A structure comparison performed using DALI,48 found no similar structure with a Z score O2. A fragment (A chain from residue 129 to 260) of the crystal structure of the E. coli rob transcription factor in complex with DNA was found to be the most similar structure with Z score of 1.1 and RMSD

terminus (Figure 7(b)). Comparing the HSQC spectra of domain III alone and domain III in the presence of unlabelled domain II, there are three shifted backbone amide cross-peaks, but the shifts are !0.02 ppm for 1H and !0.5 ppm for 15N. Thus, the interactions between domain II and domain III in isolation are very weak according to both NMR and ITC studies, suggesting that the two domains probably do not form a large number of stable contacts in the full-length protein.

Discussion
The molten globule-like properties of domain II created several problems in attempting to define its structure. A lack of spectral dispersion and broader line widths than expected for a protein of this size conspired to complicate the tasks of resonance assignment and NOE identification.28,29,50 Moreover, although secondary structure elements are expected to be native-like, tertiary interactions are

weaker, with a consequent reduction in the number of long-range NOEs. Despite these limitations, the global fold and major secondary structure elements of domain II have been defined. Proteins in the pre-molten globule state have w50% of the native secondary structure, whereas in the

molten globule state the corresponding value is close to 100%.31 Domain II is more likely to resemble a molten rather than pre-molten globule state, but it is possible that the ordered secondary structure we observe is less than that in domain II of full-length AMA1.

Inter-domain interactions and immune responses It has been suggested that naturally acquired protective immunity is directed against domain I as this domain is the most variable in AMA1.20,22,24,25,51 Detailed analyses of AMA1 allelic differences indicated that polymorphisms in both domain I and III are under diversifying selection.20,22,25,51 Of the numerous point mutations found in AMA1 sequences from several hundred P. falciparum

isolates, only four are found in domain II, and our structure shows that these are clustered in a small region of the structure (Figure 5(b)). The dearth of mutations and the lack of highly polymorphic sites in domain II could imply that very little of its surface is exposed. Indeed, it is possible that the two loops containing these four residues represent the majority of the domain II surface that is accessible to the host immune response. Recently, Lalitha et al.26 expressed each of the domains of AMA1 from the 3D7 isolate of

Structure and Interactions of AMA1 Domain II

651 domain II and may provide some clues as to the key stabilising interactions. Indeed, after our study was completed, an online version of a paper describing the P. vivax AMA1 structure appeared.54 We note that our construct, which extends from N309 to E436, lacks a five-residue sequence at the N terminus, which in the P. vivax AMA1 crystal structure forms b11 and a four-residue sequence at the C terminus, which in the P. vivax AMA1 crystal structure forms b19. It appears that the domain boundaries inferred from the amino acid sequence and disulphide locations do not match those seen in the structure. This structure shows that the N-terminal region of domain I interacts with domains II and III. The region of domain II involving the first disulphide bond seems to insert into a pocket in domain III consisting of b-strands b22, b23 and b24, b25. Presumably the additional interaction with domain I helps to stabilise the very weak interactions between these domains observed in solution. Comparing our structure of domain II in solution with that of domain II in the full ectodomain, the regions including four b-strands (b12, b12 0 , b13 and b17) are not well-defined in our final family of structures, although some of these b-strands were present in higher energy structures. This region is very likely influenced by domains I and III. Strands b14, b15, b16 and b18 in the crystal structure are present in our solution structure and correspond to strands 1­4, although they are usually one to three residues shorter and one or two residues shifted relative to the P. vivax structure. The absence of several b-strands plus the additional helices seen in the loop region in solution explains why a DALI search failed to match our domain II structure with the PAN domain found in the P. vivax ectodomain structure. The a-helix a7 is present in our final structure and relatively well defined, but it is much shorter (from C337­K339). However, we observe four other a-helices in the loop between residues 344 and 387, which are not present in the crystal structure because no electron density was observable. Importantly, this region missing from the crystal structure contains key residues in the epitope for the invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody 4G2 (which reacts with P. falciparum but not P. vivax AMA1).54 NMR thus offers a means to study this important region of the structure. It is intriguing that this region of domain II contains the epitope recognised by an invasion-inhibitory antibody even though it does not contain any of the polymorphisms that are regarded as having arisen in response to the pressure of immune recognition. Perhaps this region of domain II is essential to the function of AMA1 and cannot readily accommodate sequence changes. It is by no means invariant across species (Figure S5; Supplementary Data), suggesting that there may be some difference in function between species or that there are complementary mutations in the interacting partners in other species. We have pursued structure determination of domain II not only to define its intrinsic structure

P. falciparum, separately or in various pair-wise combinations. These were used to investigate the antibody responses directed against the domains of PfAMA1 using a combination of parasite growth inhibitory assays and competition ELISA. Single domains on their own were unable to induce significant inhibitory antibodies. However, a domain IC II construct induced inhibitory antibodies and was able to significantly inhibit antibodies raised to a domain ICIICIII construct in competition ELISA. This suggests that domain I only displays the structured epitopes recognised by invasion-inhibitory antibodies when expressed in combination with domain II. These results are consistent with the finding here that domain II construct displayed relatively few of the epitopes recognised by the naturally induced antibody response to AMA1. Role of domain II in AMA1 The lack of strong interactions between domains II and III in solution suggests that interactions with domain I are likely to be more important structurally, and the lack of these interactions is presumably what causes domain II in isolation to adopt molten globule-like properties. Strong interactions between domains I and II would also be consistent with the difficulties experienced by ourselves and others in trying to refold domain I in isolation. Domain II expresses well but lacks the structural stability expected of a stable domain, whereas in domain I the lack of structural stability in isolation may be so significant that it makes recovery of a folded form of domain I from heterologous expression systems very difficult. It is interesting to note that domain II is the most conserved in primary sequence among the three domains. Comparison of the sequence of full-length AMA1 and each of the individual domains from P. falciparum with eight other Plasmodium species (P. reichenowi, P. chabaudi, P. berghei, P. yoelii, P. fragile, P. knowlesi, P. vivax and P. cynomolgi), using CLUSTAL W52 showed that the average sequence identity was 57.1% for full-length AMA1, 53.2% for domain I, 64.1% for domain II and 58.0% for domain III. Extending this comparison to two other apicomplexan parasites, Babesia bovis and Toxoplasma gondii, lowers these figures to 54.1%, 47.7%, 56.5% and 49.4%, respectively. The higher degree of sequence conservation for domain II could be consistent with conserved roles in maintaining the overall three-dimensional structure of AMA1 or in maintenance of function (or both). The ectodomain of AMA1 from P. vivax, the other species of Plasmodium responsible for significant morbidity associated with human malaria, has been crystallised in a form suitable for X-ray crystallographic structure determination.53 Although this has only 56% sequence identity overall, and 64% in domain II, the crystal structure should show the size of the contact surface between domain I and

652 but also as a basis for determining how its structure and dynamics might change in full-length AMA1. The crystal structure of the P. vivax AMA1 ectodomain provides a partial answer to the first question, although, as noted above, it lacks a significant stretch of residues, which is the site of interaction of an invasion-inhibitory monoclonal antibody. Our NMR assignments and structure for domain II in general, and this loop in particular, provide a valuable basis for studies of domain II in complex with invasion-inhibitory molecules and other biologically relevant partners. The question of dynamics in the full-length protein will be addressed by 15N relaxation measurements on the P. falciparum AMA1 ectodomain. Based on the limited chemical shift dispersion we observe in 1D and 2D spectra of the full ectodomain and the large number of sharp resonances, we expect to detect considerable flexibility in this molecule in solution.

Germany) 1050 modular HPLC. Instrument control, data acquisition, and evaluation were performed using Hewlett­Packard HPLC3D Chemstation software. Buffer a comprised 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (HPLC/ Spectro grade; Pierce, Rockford, IL) in Milli-Q grade water (Millipore, Bedford, MA); buffer b comprised 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (ChromAR HPLC grade; Mallinckrodt, Paris, KY) in Milli-Q grade water. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis Purified fusion protein (pre-refolded starting material (SM), reduced and alkylated refolded material (RA) and refolded material (R)) was subjected to electrophoresis under both reducing and non-reducing conditions in 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, and either stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or electrotransferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blocked overnight at 4 8C with 5% (w/v) skim milk in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline). The membranes were incubated for one hour at room temperature with a pool of human plasma (pool P)5 at a dilution of 1:500 in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and 2.5% skim milk. After extensive washing in PBST, the antibodies were detected with a 1:1000 dilution of sheep anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Silenus, Melbourne, Australia). Reactions were detected using Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (NEN Life Sciences Products Inc., Boston, MA). Protein reduction was achieved by incubation with a 100-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol (DTT) over cysteine residues in the presence of 6 M GdnHCl for one hour at 42 8C and pH 8.0. Alkylation was carried out with 1000-fold molar excess of iodoacetamide over cysteine residues for one hour at room temperature in the dark. Tryptic digestion Narrow-bore RP-HPLC of DTT-reduced and nonreduced AMA1 domain II tryptic digests was used to identify the location of disulphide-linked peptides as described.16 Enzymatic cleavage of PfAMA1 domain II with trypsin to generate disulphide-linked peptides was performed under slightly acidic conditions to reduce the potential for disulphide bond interchange. To identify disulphide-linked peptides, analytical RP-HPLC analyses were performed on identical portions of the tryptic digest with and without DTT reduction. NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments for structure determination were performed on 0.8 mM protein in 95% H2O/5% 2H2O containing 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5), 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Spectra for chemical shift assignments included HNHA, HNCA, HNHB, HCCH-TOCSY, TOCSY-HSQC, HBHA(CO)NH, CBCANH, CBCA(CO) NH, (H)CCCONH, HNCO and HN(CA)CO, and were acquired on an Avance 500 (Bruker Biospin) at 25 8C using a cryoprobe. Where necessary to aid with overlap, some spectra were also collected at different pH values (pH 3.0­ 10.0) or temperatures (5­35 8C). Diffusion measurements were performed using a pulsed field gradient longitudinal eddy-current delay pulse sequence33,55 on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer using a triple-resonance probe equipped with triple-axis gradients. Two-dimensional TOCSY and NOESY (tmZ150 ms) spectra were acquired using the

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification A clone of PfAMA1 domain II, provided by Tony Hodder, was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 DE3 PlysS cells (Stratagene, CA). For unlabelled protein, expression was performed in baffled flasks with cells grown to an A600 of 0.6 in Superbroth containing 2% (w/v) glucose and 100 mg mlK1 of ampicillin. Expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were harvested three hours after induction by centrifugation at 6200 g and 4 8C for 30 minutes. For 15N labelling, cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 in M9 medium containing 1.0 g lK1 of 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. For 15N/13C-labelled samples 1.0 g lK1 of 15NH4Cl and 4 g lK1 of [13C]glucose were the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were harvested eight hours after IPTG induction by centrifugation at 6200 g and 4 8C for 30 minutes. The induced E. coli pellet was solubilised in 6 M GdnHCl (pH 8.0), and purified essentially as described.22 The protein was then refolded by dilution in a buffer containing 1 mM reduced glutathione and 0.25 mM oxidised glutathione as described.5 The refolded protein was diluted 1:4 into buffer A (10 mM NaPO4, 50 mM NaCl (pH 6.0)) and purified by cation-exchange chromatography. Bound protein was eluted from a 5 ml Hitrap SPFF cation-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) using a linear gradient from 0% to 100% buffer B (buffer A with 1 M NaCl) over 30 minutes at a flow rate of 3 ml minK1. Purified and refolded protein samples were analysed for mass by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisationtime-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Voyager Biospectrometry PR system; Applied Biosystems) with a sinapinic acid matrix. Refolding of PfAMA1 DII was monitored by RP-HPLC. A total of 25 mg of pre-refolded starting material (SM), alkylated refolded material (RA) or refolded material (R) was run on RP-HPLC (column: Brownlee, Aquapore RP-300 7 m; 100 mm!2.1 mm) over a gradient of 0­100% buffer b for 12 minutes and the resulting chromatograms compared (data not shown). Reversed-phase HPLC was performed using a Hewlett­Packard (Waldbronn,

structures was selected on the basis of stereochemistry and energy considerations and analyzed using PROCHECK-NMR64 and MOLMOL.65 Protein Data Bank accession code The coordinates for the PfAMA1 domain II have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank66 under accession code 1YXE. 8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulphonate (ANS) fluorescence measurements Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter using a temperature-controlled cuvette at 25 8C in conjunction with FL WinLab software (Perkin­Elmer, Boston, USA). Slit widths for excitation and emission were 2.5­4.0 nm and 2.5­10 nm, respectively. A 0.4 cm! 1.0 cm quartz cuvette was used, with the longer path parallel with the excitation beam. AMA1 domain II concentrations were in the range 4­6 mM and ANS concentrations were 16­50 mM. Fluorescence emission spectra were monitored with excitation set at 345 nm for ANS, domain II and domain IICANS. Isothermal titration calorimetry Isothermal calorimetric titrations were performed with a Microcal omega VP-ITC (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). AMA1 domains II and III were dialysed against buffer (10 mM sodium acetate at the same pH used for NMR analysis), and experiments were performed at 25 8C. A solution of 25 mM domain II in the cell was titrated by injection of a total of 290 ml of 200 mM domain III. The heat of dilution of domain III into buffer was determined in control experiments and subtracted from the raw data of the binding experiment. The data were analysed using the evaluation software, Microcal Origin version 5.0, supplied by the manufacturer. Analytical ultracentrifugation Sedimentation experiments were performed using a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge and Ti60 rotor. A 12 mm centrepiece and a sample volume of 100 ml were used in all measurements. Sedimentation equilibrium distributions were formed by centrifugation at 30,000 rpm and 40,000 rpm for 16­20 hours at 25 8C and the absorbance profiles were measured using wavelengths from 230 nm to 290 nm. Data were analysed by non-linear regression. A value of 0.725!10K3 m3 kgK1, as calculated from the amino acid composition, was used for the partial specific volume of AMA1 domain II. Good fits to the baselines of K0.034 and 0.009 were obtained at the two speeds and a single species of mass 14,400 was obtained. A value of 1.14!103 kg mK3 was used for the density of the 5% 2H2O/95% H2O solution.67,68 Circular dichroism CD spectra were recorded in a model 60DS AVIV CD spectrometer. Spectra were measured in 1 cm quartz cuvettes and data collected from 185 nm to 250 nm at 0.2 nm intervals with a one second integration time. The 5 mM domain II sample was in water (pH 5.2). The bandwidth was set at 1.0 nm and temperature controlled at 25 8C by a Peltier water-bath. The spectrum was

N-labelled sample with 15N decoupling, either in H2O or H2O. 15N HSQC, CLEANEX, HNHA, HNHB, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (tmZ50 and 150 ms), and 15N-edited TOCSY spectra were also acquired using the 15N-labelled sample. HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HCCHTOCSY, HBHA(CO)NH, 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (tmZ 120 ms), and CNH-NOESY (tmZ120 ms) spectra were recorded using a 13C, 15N-labelled sample. Standard pulse sequences (Bruker Biospin) were used for data acquisition, and water suppression was achieved using either WATERGATE56 or echo and anti-echo coherence selection schemes.57 For 13C and 15N-edited NOESY spectra, a recycle delay of 1.5 seconds was used and data matrix sizes were 1024!92!144 and 2048!48!160, respectively. An additional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum was acquired at 800 MHz on a Bruker Avance 800 with a mixing time of 150 ms. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to the water peak, and the 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using the 13C/1H and 15N/1H g-ratios.58 NMR data were processed in XWINNMR version 3.5 (Bruker Biospin) and analysed using XEASY version 1.3.59 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank database42 with accession number 6510. Relaxation measurements were carried out at 25 8C on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. Pulse sequences similar to those published were used.60 A series of 2D 15N­1H correlation spectra with relaxation durations ranging from 10 ms to 700 ms for T1 and 19.2 ms to 172.8 ms for T2 were used. A complex data matrix of 1024!100 together with 32 scans per t1 increment were used. The recycle times were 2.2 seconds for T1 and T2 and 3.2 seconds for the steady-state 15N­{1H} NOE, respectively. T1 and T2 were obtained by fitting peak intensities of various relaxation durations to a threeparameter and a two-parameter single-exponential decay curve, respectively. The steady-state 15N­{1H} NOE values were calculated from peak intensity ratios obtained from spectra acquired in the presence and absence of proton saturation.

NMR restraints and structure calculations Backbone f and j angle restraints were determined with TALOS.47 For the remaining residues the f angle was restricted to a negative value if a positive f could be excluded based on NOE data.61 Hydrogen bond restraints for residues N327, F329, N401, Y402, C409, E410 and I411 were assigned based on distance restraints and temperature coefficients of 15N-bound protons (jDd/DTj!4 ppb/ 8C), measured by running a series of 2D 1H­15N HSQC spectra from 5 8C to 35 8C. A hydrogen bond restraint for residue S423 was identified from 1D H/2H exchange experiment monitored over two days after dissolving the protein in 2H2O at 25 8C, and from preliminary structures based entirely on distance restraints. Hydrogen bonds were included only in latter rounds of structure calculations in regions of relatively well-defined structure. NOE cross-peaks were assigned manually and initial structures calculated using CYANA.62 Input data for CYANA included the calibrated NOE restraints from the 13 C and 15N-edited NOESY spectra, dihedral angle restraints and disulphide bonds. Due to the difficulties in measuring NOE intensities as a result of spectral overlap and peak broadening, NOEs were divided into ° ° ° ° one of four categories, 2.8 A, 3.5 A, 4.5 A or 5.5 A. Lower ° limits were set at 1.8 A in each case. The resulting structures were further refined in XPLOR-NIH63 using the simulated annealing protocol. A final family of 20

Microtitre plates were coated with recombinant 3D7 AMA1 ectodomain (2 mg mlK1, pH 7.3) overnight at 4 8C. Inhibition of the binding of rabbit or human anti-AMA1 antibodies to the coated plates was examined using refolded domain II or the AMA1 ectodomain, which were titrated in 5% skimmed milk/PBS containing a 1:50,000 dilution of a rabbit anti-AMA1 antiserum or human plasma pool P. The binding of anti-AMA1 antibodies was determined by subsequent incubation with sheep antihuman or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugates and then the horseradish peroxidase substrate 2,2 0 -azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulphonic acid).20
