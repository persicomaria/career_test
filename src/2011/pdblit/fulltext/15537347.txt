HIV-1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are part of the combination therapy currently used to treat HIV infection. The features of a new NNRTI drug for HIV treatment must include selective potent activity against both wild-type virus as well as against mutant virus that have been selected by use of current antiretroviral treatment regimens. Based on analogy with known HIV-1 NNRTI inhibitors and modeling studies utilizing the X-ray crystal structure of inhibitors bound in the HIV-1 RT, a series of substituted 2-quinolones was synthesized and evaluated as HIV-1 inhibitors.
Introduction In the life cycle of HIV, the causative agent of AIDS, one of the enzymes required for replication is the virally encoded human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (HIV RT). HIV RT converts single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA that is ultimately incorporated into the human genome.1 The utility of HIV RT as a therapeutic target has been amply established by the availability of drugs aimed at its inhibition. Six nucleoside inhibitors (AZT, D4T, 3TC, FTC, ddI, ddC and ABC), the recently FDA-approved nucleotide, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and three nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) (nevirapine,2 delavirdine3 and efavirenz4) all FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of HIV infections, exert their therapeutic efficacy by inhibiting HIV RT. NNRTIs bind in a pocket approximately 10 Å away from the catalytic site where nucleotides bind5 and are generally specific for HIV-1 RT. Treatment of HIV infection with NNRTIs has trailed behind nucleosides because of rapid emergence of resistant strains of virus. It was only after the success of combination therapy with nevirapine in sustaining a viral load reduction that a firm footing for NNRTIs was finally established.6 Efavirenz4 has set the standard for NNRTI therapy, primarily because of its favorable antiviral profiles and

¨ effectiveness in both drug-naive and drug-experienced patients. Yet despite favorable antiviral potency against a range of relevant NNRTI mutants, clinical resistance to efavirenz eventually develops due primarily to the K103N mutation. The presence of the K103N mutant has indeed become its Achilles' heel; it is the most observed mutant in AIDS patients who failed treatment with efavirenz.7-9 The ready availability of X-ray crystal structures of inhibitor-HIV RT complexes, coupled with the abundance of drug resistance data,10 has enabled us to pursue a de novo approach to drug design. One aim of the design was to study NNRTI interactions with the inhibitor binding site and to identify a common pharmacophore from the array of known structures upon which a novel chemical structure (template) could be built. Analogue synthesis would then provide an avenue for the optimization of contacts with residues around the binding pocket potentially leading to maximal effectiveness against the wild-type virus and minimal loss of potency should mutations occur. Of course, our additional aim was to identify a template that was amenable to synthesis so that we could construct a structure-activity relationship (SAR) around the molecule. As mentioned in the preceding paper,11 the common pharmacophore identified was that of structure A shown in Figure 1. After consideration of several possible templates, the quinolone as shown by structure 1 was chosen, which allowed for the incorporation of the pharmacophore. Such a structure had the additional benefit of feasibility of synthesis and amenability to substituent variations. We envisaged that an SAR could be established from modifications of the R, R and R groups in 1. Synthesis of compounds 1a-d and their subsequent antiviral results suggested that the quinolone scaffold was potentially suitable to test our design hypothesis.11 We now report the synthesis and SAR studies of additional

analogues, which culminated in the identification of a series of compounds that manifest a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a panel of clinically relevant NNRTI resistant strains. Results and Discussion Chemistry. Quinolones 1a-h and 1l-aa were prepared according to the procedures shown in Scheme 1. Appropriately substituted anilines 2 were treated with an excess of diethyl malonate and heated in diphenyl ether to 250 °C for 24 h.12a,b Alkylation of the resulting quinolones 4 with alkyl halides using sodium hydride in DMF resulted in 1a-h, 1l-aa listed in Table 1.

Compounds 1i and 1j were prepared according to procedures shown in Scheme 2. Methyl 5-Chloroanthranilate 5a and methyl 5-fluoroanthranilate 5b were first acylated with ethoxyacetyl chloride to give intermediates 6a and 6b.13 Ring closure using potassium hexamethyldisilylamide in toluene gave quinolones 4q and 4r. This step was then followed by alkylation with cyclobutylmethyl bromide using sodium hydride as the base, resulting in 1i and 1j. The synthesis of 1k began with isatoic anhydride 7, which was reacted with ethyl cyanoacetate 8 to give intermediate 9. Ring closure of 9 gave quinolone 4s, which was alkylated with cyclobutylmethyl bromide using sodium hydride as the base to give 1k. The series of procedures are depicted in Scheme 3. Compounds 1bb, 1cc, 1ee-hh were prepared according to procedures shown in Scheme 4.

in DMF at 150 °C to give trifluoroethoxy intermediates 10a-e that were then protected with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in DMF using triethylamine to give intermediates 11. Reaction with cyclopropylethynyllithium gave alkynes 12.15 Deprotection of 12 was accomplished with Dowex 50 acidic resin in a mixture of THF and methanol at room temperature providing the desired 1bb, 1cc, 1ee-gg. Compound 1hh was synthesized using the same procedure, except in this case, the lithium salt of 3-methylpentyne was used. Finally, compound 1dd was prepared according to procedures similar to those shown in Scheme 4. As shown in Scheme 5, compound 10e, which was prepared according to the procedure described above, was protected with p-methoxybenzyl chloride.16 The resultant intermediate 11 was then reacted with cyclopropylethynyllithium to give compound 12. Deprotection with ammonium cerium nitrate gave 1dd.17 Biology. We decided, as an initial task, to categorize the synthesis of the quinolone analogues into four subgroups where the R moieties were made up of cyclopropylethynyl, cyclobutylmethyl and cyclopentyl groups (see Figure 3). As synthesis progressed, additional four substituents were investigated, although in a limited sense, which was designed to extend our understanding of the binding of these quinolone ana-

logues. These were the cyclohexyl, sec-butylethynyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutyl and cyclohexylmethyl. Within the subgroups consisting of the above substituents, variations were then made around the R and R groups in rings A and B, of 1, respectively (Figure 2a). The R group included mainly the fluoro and chloro substituents. On the basis of the modeling work, the NH proton was expected to form a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl group of the K103 residue, similar to that of efavirenz. Therefore, differences in the electron-withdrawing properties of the R substituents were expected to have an effect on the acidity of the NH proton and thus the strength of the hydrogen bond. As shown in Table 1, other R substituents, intended to answer certain SAR questions, were also included. As for the R group, we focused mainly on the isopropyl and n-propyl substituents. These were the groups that were viewed to be the optimal from the design work. Other substituents were also included, primarily to confirm our understanding of the activities of the analogues having the n-propyl and isopropyl groups. The antiviral and enzyme inhibition data for all synthesized compounds are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The compounds were initially assayed in a MT4 cell infection model with wild-type HIV-1 and mutant

strains of HIV-1.18 Using an arbitrary IC50 cutoff value of e300 nM, 24 compounds were found to fall at or below the cutoff against the wild-type virus and eleven against the nevirapine resistant strain (Nev-R), which contains the mutation Y181C in the HIV-1 RT gene. The data from the list of compounds in Table 1 suggested the following: for the R group in template 1, fluoro and chloro groups appeared to be optimal for antiviral activity. Conversely, moieties such as methyl and methoxy led to compounds (1u and 1v) that showed much reduced antiviral activity. The C6 position appeared to be optimal as evidenced from the lack of antiviral activity of compound 1l (with 7-methoxy group) compared to compound 1v (with 6-methoxy group). For the R group, variations between ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl and isobutyl did not appear to have a striking difference in antiviral activity, provided that the optimal groups were used in R. Even an ethoxy group was well tolerated (compounds 1i and 1j), although both compounds were more active against the wild-type virus than against the Nev-R strain. This is in direct contrast to what was found in our modeling work, which suggested that

isopropyl and n-propyl groups would impart optimal antiviral activities. The cyclopropylethynyl subgroup had the largest number of active compounds (1bb-gg). All six compounds within this subgroup showed antiviral activity against both the wild type and the Nev-R strains that were much less than the cutoff IC50 value of e300 nM. Indeed, compounds 1ee and 1ff were two of the most potent analogues against both strains. Undeniably, the cyclopropylethynyl moiety imparted the antiviral potency since the corresponding analogues in the other subgroups (see compounds 1a, 1g, 1h) were less active. The cyclopropylethynyl motif was favorably exploited in the 1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one work that culminated in the FDA-approved efavirenz.19 In fact, our modeling suggested that when quinolone 1ee and efavirenz were superimposed in the NNRTI binding pocket, the cyclopropylethynyl moiety for both compounds projected into a common subpocket defined by the Y181 and Y188 residues. Because the electronic properties of the fluoro group are markedly different from the chloro group ( values of 0.06 and 0.23,

respectively,20 we expected that the acidity of the NH proton would be stronger for compound 1ff, and thus its hydrogen bond capability to the backbone carbonyl group of the K103 residue, than for compound 1ee. Nonetheless, compounds 1ff and 1ee showed equipotency against the wild-type virus. In fact, this equipotent tendency was observed in the rest of the analogues with similar R and R substitutents (see Table 1), suggesting therefore that antiviral potency was not dependent on the strength of the hydrogen bond between NH of the quinolone analogues and the K103 backbone carbonyl group. After the initial determination of antiviral activity, the compounds were further assayed against a panel of recombinant, isogenic viruses21 containing the wild type HIV-1 and NNRTI resistant strains encoding the following single and double mutations: K103N, V106A, G190A, Y188C, V108I, Y181C, K103N/Y181C, K103N/ G190A, V106A/Y181C, K103N/V108I, and V108I/Y181C. These mutations occur in the binding site where the NNRTIs come in close contact with and are generally associated with NNRTI-treatment failures. It is now known that the most common mutations that manifest high cross-resistance to a vast array of NNRTIs are the K103N and the Y181C while other mutations are generally compound specific. In addition

to virus strains encoding the K103N and the Y181C mutations, resistance to nevirapine is also due to strains encoding the G190A, Y188C and the V106A mutations, and the P236L mutation in the case of delavirdine.22 Again, using an arbitrary IC50 value cutoff of e300 nM, almost the same number of compounds active against the wild-type and Y181C strains were identified as that in the MT4 assay. Twenty-eight compounds were active against the G190A strain and twenty-seven against the Y188C mutant. The compounds generally showed weak activity against the K103N strain with only two compounds (1d and 1z) showing IC50 values of <300 nM against the K103N resistant strain. Similarly, the activity against strains containing two mutations was lacking, except for compounds 1bb, 1dd, 1ee, 1ff and 1hh. Five compounds (1dd, 1ee, 1ff, 1f, and 1q) were active against the V106A strain. As was found in the MT4 assay, the active compounds came mainly from the cyclopropylethynyl subgroup. In fact, broad-spectrum activity against the panel of mutants was seen among analogues within this subgroup. Among them, compound 1bb was the most broadspectrum in its antiviral activity, and was then followed by compounds 1dd, 1ee and 1ff. However, in general, compounds 1ee and 1ff had higher potency. As alluded to above, for an NNRTI to be considered truly effective, particularly among drug-experienced patients, the compound needs to be able to overcome the cross-resistance barrier imposed by the K103N and the Y181C mutations and to be active against mutants insensitive to currently available drugs. As shown in the bar diagram of Figure 4, efavirenz was generally potent against key NNRTI resistant strains listed in Table 2, which thus makes it currently the most effective NNRTI in the market. On the other hand, nevirapine and delavirdine did not generally fare well against the same set of resistant strains. When compared with nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz, a few of the quinolone analogues such as 1ee and 1ff (see Figure 4) were more broad-spectrum in their antiviral activities than nevirapine and delavirdine and were quite similar to that of efavirenz. Additionally, both

Figure 4a. We have reported the structures of four RTquinolone complexes (RT-2a, RT-2b, RT-5, and RT-6; Hopkins et al., preceding paper). Comparing the protein core of 110 residues around the NNRTI site of RTGW490745X with those of RT and quinolone analogue complexes more than 87% of the CA atoms can be overlapped with rms deviations of 0.56 Å, 0.57 Å, 0.55 Å and 0.56 Å, respectively. The chemical differences between the inhibitors result in slight alterations in the binding modes at the NNRTI site, which are accommodated by conformational changes in the protein, mainly in side-chains but also to a lesser extent in the main-chain (Figure 4b). GW490745X has a cyclopropylethynyl group instead of the cyclohexyloxy or cyclohexylthio of other quinolone analogues (Hopkins et al., preceding paper). A result of this differing substituent is that GW490745X binds in a significantly different

position and orientation compared with 2b. GW490745X shifts about 1 Å toward V179, with the quinolone ring tilted by some 10° and the isopropyl group rotated about 180°. To avoid a clash with the isopropyl group of the inhibitor the side-chain of V179 is rotated by 120°. The cyclopropylethynyl group is positioned more distantly from Y188 and hence has fewer contacts with this residue. There is a more than 0.5 Å main-chain movement at residues 98-101 such that a similar H-bond distance from the inhibitor to the carbonyl oxygen is maintained (2.64 Å, 2a:2.55 Å, 5:2.67 Å, 6:2.81 Å, 2b: 2.78 Å). The position and smaller size of the fluorine atom of GW490745X (chlorine in the other quinolones)

also introduces changes at the 10- 11 loop whose flexible nature allows for the NNRTI site to accommodate inhibitors very different in size.26,29 The conformation difference of the W229 side-chain can be attributed to the difference in unit cell for the crystals.30 Comparison of RT-GW490745X and RT-Efavirenz Complexes. 92 out of 110 CA atoms of the protein core around the NNRTI site of RT-GW490745X can be superimposed on that of RT-efavirenz31 with an rms deviation of 0.44 Å. The quinolone ring of GW490745X is tilted by about 10° from the benzoxazin-2-one ring of efavirenz such that the fluorine end of the quinolone ring is positioned about 0.5 Å higher and also drags

V106 with it (Figure 4c). The cyclopropyl group of GW490745X is positioned higher up in the site due to its extra oxygen atom, thereby making more interactions with W229. The isopropyl group is positioned closer to V179, about 1.5 Å offset from the structurally related trifluoromethyl group of efavirenz which occupies the so-called "Tyrosine 181 trigger" position.26 The H-bond from the ring NH to the carbonyl oxygen of K101 is shorter (2.64 Å) than that of RT-efavirenz (2.72 Å). There are also differences in protein side-chain conformation when comparing the two complexes, for example at residues V106, V179, Y181 and L234 (47° difference in the 2 angle of Y181; 1.6 Å distance between the CG1 atoms of V179). Structure and Antiviral Activity Relationship. The differences in position and orientation between RTGW490745X (1ee) and the four other quinolone compounds in the NNRTI pocket can be attributed to the substitution of the cyclohexyloxy or cyclohexylthio by a cyclopropylethynyl group in 1ee. Indeed the cyclopropylethynyl group is positioned much closer to cyclopropylpropynyl group of efavirenz. Crystal structures of complexes of RT with potent NNRTIs invariably have a substituent that occupies the same volume as filled by the trifluoromethyl group of efavirenz (Figure 4c).26,32 Interestingly, although the trifluoromethyl is at the 4-position on the benzoxazin-2-one ring of efavirenz and is perpendicular to the ring plane, for 1ee the isopropyl group fulfills this role but is in the 3-position of the quinolone and in the plane of the ring. Thus it is probably the tendency of the isopropyl group to occupy the "Tyrosine 181 trigger" volume that tilts the quinolone ring compared to the benzoxazin-2-one ring of efavirenz. Despite this, 1ee has higher spatial overlap with efavirenz in the NNRTI pocket compared to the other four quinolone analogues, which explains its better antiviral activity. There are less hydrophobic interactions from the smaller cyclopropylethynyl group of 1ee to Y181 and Y188 compared to the cyclohexyloxy or cyclohexylthio groups of the four other quinolone analogues, explaining the smaller reduction of the antiviral activity due to Y181C or Y188C mutation. The details of NNRTI binding derived from the crystal structures of the quinolone analogues correlate well with the SAR data (Table 1). The isopropyl group of 1ee forms strong van de Waals interactions with V179. Replacement of the group with ethyl (1bb) or n-propyl (1cc) would either reduce the hydrophobic interactions or introduce structural clashes, therefore weakening the antiviral activity (Table 2). A larger group such as isobutyl (1gg) would reposition or reorient the inhibitor in the NNRTI pocket, resulting in significant loss of activity. The 6-fluoro group has a close contact (3.3 Å) with the CB atom of residue L234, a larger Cl substitute (1ff) would position the quinolone ring closer to the benzoxazin-2-one ring of efavirenz as well as to V106. That 1ff has higher activity against the V106A mutant virus is probably because A106 would be able to move closer to the inhibitor, partially compensating the loss of protein-inhibitor interactions in the mutant structure. 1ee and efavirenz have a very similar spectrum of activity against V108I, Y181C and Y188C mutant viruses, which is reflected in the crystal structures where the two inhibitors have similar interactions with

these residues. The G190A mutant virus is 6-fold less sensitive to efavirenz, but 2-fold more sensitive to 1ee compared to wild-type virus. The trifluoromethyl group of efavirenz makes several hydrophobic contacts with G190, while 1ee has no interaction with this residue, the closest approach to the CA atom of G190 is 5.1 Å. There is enough room for an alanine side-chain between the quinolone ring and G190, and the G190A mutation would be predicted to give greater protein-inhibitor interaction and increase the tightness of inhibitor binding. Conclusions We selected compound 1ee for further evaluation of its druglike properties. The pharmacokinetic properties of compound 1ee showed acceptable parameters including clearance, half-life and oral bioavailability, 44 mL/ min/kg, 3.7 h, and 34% respectively. The therapeutic index based on the ratio of the IC50 values of the MT4 cell lines versus the IC50 value against the wild-type virus and Nev-R was >4000. In the MT4 assay, compound 1ee showed an approximately 8-fold decrease in wild-type IC50 value in the presence of 45% human serum and a 2-fold decrease in the presence of 15% fetal calf serum. In summary, we have shown that, based on known crystal structures and resistance data, a quinolone template was designed, and synthesis led to a group of analogues with a broad spectrum of activity against both wild-type HIV-1 and key NNRTI-relevant mutant viruses. Analogues 1ee and 1ff demonstrated the most broad-spectrum activity among these analogues and were more potent than nevirapine and delavirdine against mutant viruses that generally are insensitive to currently known NNRTIs. The quinolone class of NNRTIs, as predicted by their design, have proven to be effective and potent against a wide range of diverse drug resistant mutants, far more so than the first generation NNRTIs. However, in the range of analogues reported here, we did not improve upon the potency of efavirenz, particularly in comparison with their activity against the K103N strain. In conclusion, we believe the data presented here justifies our initial assumption that the structural analysis of the binding modes and drug resistant mechanisms of NNRTIs can lead to valuable insights to aid the design of the next generation of nonnucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The principles established in our previous paper11 and demonstrated here for the quinolone series may also be applicable to other potential NNRTI templates to guide the search for inhibitors with improved drug resistance properties.

Crystallization, Data Collection and Structure Determination. Crystals of the RT-GW490745 complex were grown from solutions containing RT at 26 mg/mL with a 1:1.1 molar ratio of compound, 6% PEG 3400, buffered with citrate/ phosphate, pH 5.0, using the sitting-drop method as described previously.23 The crystals were partially dehydrated by increasing the PEG concentration to 50% over 3 days prior to data collection. X-ray data were collected at the Photon Factory, KEK, Japan, at 100 K using a Weissenberg camera.24 Data frames of 3.5° with a coupling constant 1.5°/mm were collected with an exposure time of 210 s. Indexing and integration of data images were carried out with DENZO, and data were merged with SCALEPACK.25 The orientation and position of the RT molecule in the cell were determined using rigid-body refinement with an initial model of RT-MKC442 (PDB code 1rt1,).26 Rounds of positional, simulated annealing and individual B-factor refinement with bulk solvent correction and model rebuilding resulted in the current structure with R-factor of 0.213 for all the data and rms deviations of 0.008 Å and 1.4° from ideality for bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. Both the bound inhibitor as well as the protein residues around it, have well-defined electron density (Figure 4a). Due to the limited reflections-toparameters ratio, atoms distal to the NNRTI site (defined as >20 Å from the CR of Y188) were tightly restrained to their positions after domain-wise rigid-body refinement. Refinement and model rebuilding were carried out with programs CNS27 and O.28 Table 3 shows the X-ray data and crystallographic refinement statistics.
