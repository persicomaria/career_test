ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease associated with a high rate of mortality. The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the etiological agent of the disease. Although public health procedures have been effective in combating the spread of SARS, concern remains about the possibility of a recurrence. Various approaches are being pursued for the development of efficacious therapeutics. One promising approach is to develop small molecule inhibitors of the essential major polyprotein processing protease 3Clpro. Here we report a complete description of the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of 3Clpro using fully degenerate peptide libraries consisting of all 160 000 possible naturally occurring tetrapeptides. The substrate specificity data show the expected P1-Gln P2-Leu specificity and elucidate a novel preference for P1-His containing substrates equal to the expected preference for P1-Gln. These data were then used to develop optimal substrates for a high-throughput screen of a 2000 compound small-molecule inhibitor library consisting of known cysteine protease inhibitor scaffolds. We also report the 1.8 Å X-ray crystal structure of 3Clpro bound to an irreversible inhibitor. This inhibitor, an R, -epoxyketone, inhibits 3Clpro with a k3/Ki of 0.002 µM-1 s-1 in a mode consistent with the substrate specificity data. Finally, we report the successful rational improvement of this scaffold with second generation inhibitors. These data provide the foundation for a rational small-molecule inhibitor design effort based upon the inhibitor scaffold identified, the crystal structure of the complex, and a more complete understanding of P1-P4 substrate specificity.

A newly discovered, highly infectious coronavirus has been shown to be the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).1 The SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a potentially lethal pathogen, and much effort has been spent developing effective therapeutics.

so far been promising with reports of protective immunity in mice (1). An intranasal vaccine has also been shown to protect monkeys (2). While vaccines represent a potentially effective first line of defense against a recurrence of SARS, the speed at which SARS can spread necessitates the availability of drugs to treat those who are already infected. The SARS-CoV is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (3). The 30 kilobase (kb) long genome is predicted to encode 10 open reading frames (4, 5). The first open reading frame at 21 kb is referred to as the replicase and encodes two overlapping polyproteins Orf1a and Orf1b (5). Functionally active proteins are released from the polyproteins through proteolytic processing by two virally encoded thiol proteases. A papain-like protease (PLP) is predicted to cleave the polyprotein in four places, and a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3Clpro), often called the major protease, is predicted to cleave the polyprotein at 11 sites (4). Both proteases are thought to be essential for viral replication, and they share significant homology with proteases of other coronaviruses including avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), transmissible gastrointestinal virus (TGEV), and murine hepatitis virus (MHV). The 11 3Clpro cleavage sites are characterized by a P1-Gln, P2-Leu/Phe motif. Of these, the most preferred cleavage site contains the P6-P1 sequence T-S-A-V-L-Q (6). The P1-Gln specificity is conserved

Inhibitor for Major Protease of SARS Coronavirus in all known coronavirus 3Clpro cleavage sites and is considered an absolute requirement for cleavage by this enzyme (7). 3Clpro has previously been expressed and characterized (8). The enzyme is an obligate dimer with one independent active site per monomer. In addition, structural data have been reported including structures bound to a peptidyl chloromethyl ketone (CMK) (9). Finally, small molecule inhibitors have been identified and characterized (8, 1019). Here, we report the non-prime side tetrapeptide specificity of the SARS-CoV including evidence for a previously undescribed P1 substrate specificity that is conserved among related proteases of the coronavirus family. We also report the identification and characterization of a promising smallmolecule inhibitor scaffold that inhibits this class of enzymes as well as viral production. Finally, we report structural data describing the mode of inhibitor binding of this new class of 3Clpro inhibitors that provides a structural rationale for the unique substrate specificity of the enzyme. MATERIALS AND METHODS Protein Cloning, Expression, and Purification. cDNA from the Tor2 strain of the SARS-CoV was provided as a gift from Dr. Derisi, UCSF. 3Clpro from IBV and MHV were obtained from Dr. Baker at Loyola University Chicago and Dr. Britton of the Compton Laboratory in Newbury U.K. The gene encoding 3Clpro was cloned, expressed, and purified as described by Kuo et al. (8) with a yield of approximately 50 mg of purified protein per liter of culture. Various constructs containing amino and carboxy terminal purification tags were also attempted but found to be inferior to the native sequence primarily due to defects in dimerization. The purified and concentrated 3Clpro was stored in 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM NaCl at 10 mg/mL. For long-term storage, the enzyme was snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. Snap freezing was found to have no deleterious affect on enzyme activity. Enzyme Assay, Substrate Library Profiling, and Inhibitor Screening. 3Clpro substrate specificity was determined using a complete diverse tetrapeptide substrate library (20) with 10 µM enzyme in each well in 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 0.01% Brij-35, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. This library contains a total of 160 000 unique sequences covering all possible tetrapeptides covalently linked via an amide bond to a fluorogenic amino-carbamoyl coumarin moiety. For single substrate kinetic assays, enzyme concentration was held constant at 35 nM, and substrate was varied from 0.12 to 250 µM. The initial reaction velocity was measured during the linear phase of the reaction by monitoring the timedependent increase in fluorescence with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate fluorometer. The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression in Kaleidagraph. For our high-throughput screen, substrate concentration was kept constant at 25 µM. Candidate inhibitors were first assayed at 200 µM inhibitor concentration. Approximately 2000 compounds were tested. The inclusion of 0.01% Brij-35 detergent was found to be crucial for avoiding nonspecific inhibition by promiscuous inhibitors (21). Compounds exhibiting greater than 95%

The inhibitor library is a collection of candidate cysteine protease inhibitors curated at U.C.S.F. by the Sandler Center for Basic Research in Parasitic Diseases (McKerrow, unpublished data). The individual inhibitors have been collected from several academic and industry collaborators. These inhibitors consist of a variety of electrophilic functional groups known to inhibit cysteine proteases including hydroxymethylketones, phenothiazines, thiosemicarbazides, acylamides, vinyl sulfones, and acyl hydrazines as well as reversible inhibitor scaffolds. The library primarily directed against proteases of Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma cruzi. The P. falciparum and T. cruzi cysteine proteases falcipain and cruzain possess a P2-Leu preference suggesting its utility for screening against 3Clpro. Inhibitor Kinetics. Substrate concentration was held constant at 100 µM, and enzyme concentration was tested at both 35 and 350 nM. Twelve different inhibitor concentrations were tested varying from 0.1 to 100 µM. Initial velocities were collected in triplicate as described above. Data were analyzed with the program dynafit (22) using a competitive inhibitor model. Because of the irreversible nature of the inhibitors studied, inhibition data are presented as a ratio of the rate of inhibition (k3) versus the inhibition constant Ki. Epoxyketone Synthesis. WRR 210 and WRR 211 were synthesized as described (23). WRR 182, 183, 485-488, 492, 493, 495 and 496 were prepared by established methods to synthesize other epoxy ketones with minor modifications (23-25). Treatment of Weinreb amide (Scheme 1, compound labeled 1) with vinylmagnesium bromide, followed by ketone reduction provided 2:1 mixtures of R and S allylic alcohols, respectively. The Boc group was removed with trifluoroacetic acid, and the resulting amines were coupled to the appropriate Cbz-protected amino acids under standard peptide coupling conditions. Epoxidation of 4 with m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid, followed by oxidation of the epoxy alcohol using DessMartin periodinane provided both diastereomers of the targeted epoxy ketones which were separated by silica gel chromatography. Crystallization Data Collection and Structure Determination. 3Clpro was cocrystallized with an equimolar concentration of inhibitor WRR 183 in 10% PEG 6000, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% DMSO, 10% glycerol, 150 mM sodium chloride, and 100 mM MES pH 6.0. Crystals were soaked in the synthetic mother liquor with 200 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 20% glycerol for 15 min prior to flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction quality crystals grew in three weeks. Data were collected at the advanced light source beamline 8.3.1 at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs Berkeley, CA with 1.1 Å incident radiation in 180 1° oscillations at 100 K. A second pass with an increased detector to crystal distance was collected to better measure the low-resolution reflections. The space-group was determined to be P21. Data were processed, reduced, and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA (26, 27). Phases were determined by molecular replacement using model 1Q2W in EPMR (28). The structure was refined against the observed data to 1.8 Å resolution in REFMAC5 (29). The structural model was built manually using the interactive program suite XtalView (30). Free atoms

density refinement as implemented in Arp/wARP (31) was used to reduce model bias in the electron density maps during the early rounds of model building. The bound inhibitor was modeled after the free R-factor was below 28%. Finally, torsion libration screw (TLS) refinement of rigid body motions (32) was used to model thermal motion of each protease monomer as well as each bound ligand (a total of four TLS groups). Waters were added prior to the last step of refinement. Statistics for the X-ray cocrystal structure are reported in Table 1. The coordinates of this structure have been deposited in the protein data bank (33). Inhibition of Viral Replication Assay. The effects of WRR 183 and WRR 495 on viral replication were assayed as previously described (34). Briefly, 50 µL of Vero E6 cells at 10 000 cells/well were dispensed into a 96-well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Following 24 h, compound was added, and cells were infected by SARS-CoV (Tor2) at a concentration of 100* 50% tissue culture infection dose. Internal controls included media only, cells in media only, cells infected with virus, and virus infected cells treated with calpain inhibitor IV. After 72 h incubation, 100 µL of Promega CellTiter-Glo was added to each well, and the resulting luminescence was recorded. IC50 and EC50 values were then calculated as described by Severson et al. (34). RESULTS Tetrapeptide Specificity, Single Substrate Kinetics, and Inhibitor DiscoVery. Recombinant SARS-CoV 3Clpro was assayed for substrate specificity using a complete diverse

positional-scanning synthetic combinatorial library (PS-SCL) based on the 7-amino-4-carbamoyl-coumarin (ACC) fluorogenic leaving group. (Figure 1a) This technology provides an unbiased way of assigning the tetrapeptide substrate specificity of a given protease. As expected based on both biological polyprotein cleavage sites and substrate specificity against synthetic peptides, the enzyme exhibits a strong preference for P1 glutamine containing substrates and P2 leucine containing substrates. Surprisingly, the enzyme also shows a strong preference for P1 histidine containing substrates. We confirmed these results by synthesizing single substrates and comparing their kinetic constants (Figure 1b). Figure 1b also shows that 3Clpro has extended substrate specificity at P5 and P6 preferring hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine. We also tested the P1 His containing substrate Ac-TS-A-V-L-H-(ACC) against the related 3C-like proteases from IBV and MHV, to determine if this P1-His preference is conserved. These enzymes share functional as well as sequence and structural homology. Both enzymes exhibit similar strong specificity for polyprotein cleavage after Gln with a kcat/Km of 2.8 ( 0.6 mM-1 s-1 and 2.2 ( 0.4 mM-1 s-1 for IBV and MHV, respectively. Analysis of Ac-TS-A-V-L-H-(ACC) shows that IBV and MHV 3C-like proteases cleave after P1-His with a kcat/Km of 19.9 ( 3.1 mM-1 s-1 and 16.3 ( 1.1 mM-1 s-1 for IBV and MHV, respectively, demonstrating that, unlike SARS-CoV 3Clpro, histidine is strongly preferred in the P1 position in comparison to P1-Gln. The substrate specificity data were then used to perform a high-throughput in vitro screen of a focused cysteine protease specific inhibitor library using the optimized fluorogenic peptide substrate Ac-T-S-T-K-L-Q-ACC. After a first pass through the inhibitor library using an inhibitor concentration of 200 µM, 80 compounds out of a total of 2000 were chosen for further testing. These compounds were then subjected to a second round of screening at an inhibitor concentration of 10 µM. The most promising scaffold to result from our library screen was the dipeptidyl epoxyketone (23, 24) based on the reproducible timedependent inhibition of proteolytic activity. Dipeptidyl derivatives of the parent compound from the library were synthesized and selected for further study (Figure 2).

Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 30, 2007 8747 183 inhibited viral replication >50% at 10 µM. Finally, a second generation of inhibitors based on the WRR 183 scaffold was synthesized on the basis of computer modeling, substrate specificity data, and synthetic accessibility (Figure 2e-l) and tested for inhibition of 3Clpro. WRR 495 was found to inhibit 3Clpro with a k3/Ki of 0.5 µM-1 s-1. WRR 183 and WRR 495 were tested in a tissue culture based assay for their affect on viral replication. Both compounds exhibited inhibition of viral replication at high concentration (>50 µM). However, WRR 495 showed pronounced toxicity demonstrating toxic effects in 50% of cells at approximately 20 µM. WRR 183 on the other hand was found to inhibit the virus with an EC50 of 12 µM, while exhibiting 50% toxicity at 60.56 µM. Mode of Inhibitor Binding. There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the WRR183:3Clpro crystal structure, and the inihibtor interacts with each monomer in an identical manner to within coordinate error except at the N-terminal serine residue. Exact angles and distances will only be reported for the interaction between monomer chain A and inhibitor chain C unless otherwise noted. WRR 183 is a peptidyl R, -epoxyketone that inhibits 3Clpro by S-alkylation of the active site cysteine. Nucleophilic attack by the active site cysteine results in the opening of the epoxide ring and the formation of a 1.9 Å thioether bond at C-2. (Figure 3a) This opening also results in extension of the atoms of the linearized oxirane ring past the oxyanion hole and into the P1 binding site. This has the effect of altering the expected register of binding. Thus, although WRR 183 has an Ala at P1, after catalysis a new P1 moiety is formed from the epoxide ring opening and Ala becomes P2. A hydrogen bond (3.2 Å) is formed between the 01 terminal hydroxyl of the inhibitor and the backbone carbonyl of Leu 144. The terminal hydroxyl forms a hydrogen bond (3.0 Å) to an ordered water molecule deep in the P1 pocket. This water is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds to N of His 163 (2.9 Å) and the N of His 172 (3.4 Å). The P2 residue of the inhibitor WRR183 is an L-alanine. The side chain of this residue is oriented toward solvent and does not interact with any subsite, its closest approach being 4.9 Å from the C of Thr 25. However, the backbone amide hydrogen bonds with the catalytic His 41 epsilon nitrogen (3.1 Å) and the carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds to the amide hydrogen atoms of Gly 143 (3.0 Å) and Cys 145 (3.2 Å). The side chain of the P3 Phe lies sandwiched in between the side chains of Met 49 and Met 165 forming favorable sulfur arene interactions (35). The terminal carbons of the phenylalanine side chain (C11-C13) make close contacts with the main chain atoms of residues 187 and 188. The carbonyl carbon of the benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) protecting group forms a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide of Glu 166 (3.1 Å). Two different conformations are seen at the N-terminus of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit. In monomer B, the formal positive charge of the Ser 1B NH3 points toward the side chain of Asn 214B (2.6 Å) forming an intramolecular interaction. In monomer A, the formal positive charge of the N-terminus projects toward the S4 subsite of the neighboring monomer and is neutralized by the side chain of Glu 166 (3.5 Å), forming an intramolecular salt bridge. This makes the Glu166 side chain effectively uncharged and the phenyl ring of the CBZ protecting group is positioned

183 also inhibits MHV 3Clpro but shows no inhibition against IBV 3Clpro up to 20 µM. This compound is an epoxide-based inhibitor with a P3 L-phenylalanine residue and an R configuration at C-2 of the epoxide group (Figure 2b). The stereochemistry of the epoxide was found to be crucial. WRR 182 and WRR 210, which are the C-2 (S) epoxide isomers of WRR 183 and WRR 211, are 10-fold less potent against the enzyme. These four compounds (Figure 2a-d) were evaluated for inhibition of viral replication in a tissue culture assay. WRR 182 and 183 inhibited viral replication with no detectable cytotoxicity, and WRR

to adopt extensive van der Waals contacts with the resulting hydrophobic pocket. However, the electron density for this ring is disordered in both monomers of our crystal structure making the precise orientation of this phenyl group ambiguous (Figure 3b). Modeling of a histidine in the S1 pocket of the protease bound to a P1 glutamine inhibitor (19) suggests that both histidine and glutamine can adopt the same binding mode in the S1 pocket (Figure 3c). In particular, both residues are capable of hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl O of Phe 140 and the N of His 163 in the bottom of the binding pocket. Comparison of the S1 pockets of SARS-CoV 3Clpro and TGEV 3Clpro (36) suggests that the related IBV and MHV 3Clpro enzymes also adopt a similar binding mode but fails to explain the increased preference of these enzymes for P1-His preferences in comparison to SARS-CoV 3Clpro. DISCUSSION The substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3Clpro (Figure 1a) shows a novel combination for P2 and P1 residues that may allow the design of extremely specific inhibitors. Although the P1 specificity profile clearly demonstrates an expected P1 glutamine specificity shown previously by inspection of known natural cleavage sites in vivo and against peptides in vitro, there is also an unexpected P1-His preference. This

P1-His preference is unlikely to be an artifact arising from a coumarin reporting group in the P1 position. First, of the over 30 serine and cysteine proteases we have profiled for tetrapeptide substrate specificity with this method (20, 37, 38), none exhibit a preference for P1-His and except for 3Clpro none exhibit an unexpected P1 preference. Second, extensive characterization of Granzyme B demonstrates that the absolute preference of the enzyme for P1-Asp is not affected by the use of a coumarin leaving group (39). Previously, it has been reported that this enzyme shows an absolute preference for P1-Gln (4, 6, 8, 16, 19, 40) demonstrating the advantage of using a fully degenerate tetrapeptide library to determine the P4 to P1 substrate specificity of a protease. An exhaustive search of the MEROPS database (41) shows that no mammalian proteases cleave after P2-Leu P1-His. Figure 1b shows that the enzyme recognizes P1-His containing substrates with an equivalent kcat/Km as corresponding P1-Gln substrates. It is likely that a P1-His inhibitor may show increased specificity for 3Clpro over host proteases. The preference for P1-His substrates also raises the possibility that unidentified proteolytic sites encoded in the coronavirus or host genome exist. A search of possible protease sites using POPS (42) reveals a possible cleavage site in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp9 (GenBank ID NP_828869) of SARS-CoV.

8750 Biochemistry, Vol. 46, No. 30, 2007 A subset of P5 and P6 preferences was analyzed through the use of single substrates based on the identity of P5 and P6 residues at known in vivo SARS-CoV cleavage sites. The increase in kcat/Km with substrates containing a Leu at either P5 or P6 suggests that the Leu may interact with the same residues of the SARS-CoV extended substrate binding site whether it is in P5 or P6. This phenomenon is similar to that found for the P3 or P4 (but not both) specificity for arginine found in membrane-type serine protease 1 (43). Figure 1b also clearly shows the strong requirement this enzyme has for extended substrate interactions before catalysis can occur. Unlike trypsin, for example, which can cleave ACC substrates with a single amino acid length, we do not detect SARS-CoV 3Clpro proteolytic activity with substrates shorter than two amino acids, and we detect only minimal activity against tripeptides. The hexapeptide substrate, designed on the basis of the tetrapeptide library profile, substrate solubility, synthetic accessibility, and known SARS protease cleavage sites, allowed us to perform a high-throughput fluorometric assay for inhibitors using a focused cysteine protease specific inhibitor library. The library contains many compounds designed to bind with a Leu or other hydrophobic moiety in the S2 pocket, suggesting its utility for 3Clpro inhibitor discovery. This library contains a diverse array of chemotypes known to inhibit cysteine proteases. Interestingly, only the epoxy ketones were shown to potently inhibit 3Clpro. However, direct comparison of the relative efficacy of different electrophilic functional groups was not explored further. Our library also contains several derivatives of the chemically similar epoxysuccinate or E-64 inhibitors including E-64c and E-64d and those reported to inhibit cathepsins (44). We detected no inhibition of 3Clpro with these compounds, nor with any peptidyl vinyl sulfones (45). Molecular modeling suggests that this may be due to steric hindrance by the C-1 carboxylate of the epoxysuccinate class of inhibitors with residues lining the oxyanion hole. Lee et al. (46) have recently published the structure of 3Clpro bound to an aza-peptide epoxide analogue. In their structure, the P1 residue (Gln) of the inhibitor lies in the S1 site. In contrast, in our structure the first residue of the inhibitor occupies the noncanonical S2 subsite. This may be because Gln is heavily preferred over the residues we have tested, namely, Ala, Phe, homo-Phe, and Gly at the P1 position. Unfortunately, we cannot test this hypothesis because both Gln and His at the P1 position in a WRR 183 analogue have proven to be synthetically inaccessible. However, because of this major difference in binding modes between the aza-peptide epoxides of Lee et al. and the epoxyketones described here, we consider these scaffolds to be fundamentally different. Epoxyketones were previously designed and synthesized as inhibitors of the cysteine protease cruzain, but the C-2 (S) epimers 182 and 210 were substantially more active against that enzyme (23) demonstrating that the correct stereochemistry at the epoxide ring is essential for potent inhibition. The cocrystal structure with WRR 183 suggests that binding of the S epimer WRR 182 would position the C2 carbon too far from the active-site cysteine for efficient attack.

Goetz et al. The structure also exhibits some differences when compared to the crystal structures of 3Clpro bound to the CMK pentapeptide Cbz-Val-Asn-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln (9) and a peptidyl Michael acceptor (19). In the CMK complex, the authors describe two different pH switched active site conformations, one catalytically competent and one incompetent characterized by a collapsed P1-pocket and oxyanion hole. This incompetent form is present at low pH. In our structure, we do not see the incompetent conformation. Presumably, this is due to the soak of our crystals into synthetic mother liquor at pH 7.5 prior to flash cooling. The ring-opening of the epoxide upon nucleophilic attack by the active-site cysteine results in the formation of an alcohol group in the P1 position. This hydroxyl group makes hydrogen bonds with residues at the bottom of the S1 pocket both directly and through a water molecule that mimic the mode of binding of substrate in the S1 pocket. These favorable interactions suggest that it may be possible to use this scaffold to synthesize potent noncovalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3Clpro. The P2-Ala of WRR183 binds at the noncanonical S2 binding site described by Yang et al. (9). This interaction is somewhat surprising because the side chain in both structures points toward bulk solvent belying the expected strong preference for leucine. Yang et al. hypothesize that this perhaps explains the relative lack of stringency for the P2 residue for Sars-CoV 3Clpro as compared to the homologous major cysteine proteases of TGEV and HCoV. However, our PS-SCL library results clearly demonstrate that in fact leucine is strongly preferred at P2. This suggests that while leucine is strongly preferred at P2, other amino acids, namely, Met and Phe, are tolerated but result in drastically lower cleavage rates. The work of Fan et al. (6) corroborates this hypothesis reporting a 50% decrease in cleavage for P2 Phe substrates and a >90% decrease in cleavage rates for Val and Met substitutions. However, a more thorough comparison between SARS-CoV, TGEV, and HCoV 3Clpro is still necessary for a full understanding. Regardless, the mode of binding of the P2Ala with the side chain oriented toward solvent in our structure does explain how WRR 211 (P2-homo-Phe) can inhibit an enzyme with such a strong leucine preference at that site. The structural and biochemical data on these inhibitors suggest that considerable diversity will be tolerated at this site. The P3-Phe interaction is likely the greatest determinant of specificity for this inhibitor. It interacts with a methionine clasp (Figure 3a) in the canonical S2 subsite identified by Yang et al. (9). This is also the same site at which the P2Leu of the previously reported peptidyl Michael acceptor N2 (19) binds. A search of the relibase database of protein ligand interactions (47) shows that this favorable sulfurarene interaction is similar to that found in calmodulin bound to trifluoperazine (48). Additionally, C-12, the terminal carbon of the P3-Phe side chain of the inhibitor approaches within 3.4 Å of the carbonyl oxygen of Arg 188 deep in the pocket (Figure 3a). The close contact suggests that a heterocyclic phenylalanine analogue capable of an electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interaction with this carbonyl oxygen might be favored. It is unclear whether the CBZ group of WRR 183 plays an important role in the in vitro activity of WRR 183 against SARS-CoV 3Clpro. The contribution of the CBZ protecting

Inhibitor for Major Protease of SARS Coronavirus group is also unknown in vivo. Certainly, given the strong preference of 3Clpro for extended substrates, derivatization of this protecting group, either by replacement with a peptide bond and another amino acid or by a nonpeptide functional group, presents a facile way of exploring further diversity for this scaffold. To that end, WRR 495 was synthesized and found to be 275-fold more potent than the parent compound WRR 183. WRR 183 and 495 are identical except for the addition of the most preferred amino acid for the S3 pocket (Figure 1a). This suggests that the inhibitor improvement in vitro is due to the use of the optimal amino acid Val for interaction with the S3 pocket. Validation of this scaffold as an effective inhibitor against replication of virus in a tissue culture model provided promising results for compound WRR 183. However, despite the 275-fold improvement of WRR 495 over WRR 183 against SARS-CoV 3Clpro in vitro, WRR 495 exhibited greatly increased toxicity and no increase in efficacy. This result demonstrates the increased complexity encountered when transitioning from an in vitro enzyme based assay to a cell-based assay and suggests there are other aspects of this scaffold that must be optimized. Recently, there have been a number of successes in the search for efficacious therapeutics against the SARS-CoV. The work we report here reveals the complete tetrapeptide specificity of the 3Clpro drug target identifying an unexpected P1 specificity, provides a useful pharmacaphore lead, identifies a low-molecular weight small molecule that inhibits the enzyme, and elucidates the molecular determinants of this inhibitor/enzyme interaction. Future work will focus on examining a possible in vivo role for the P1 histidine preference including whether or not it is a general phenomenon of coronaviral major proteases, identifying promising electrophilic functional groups other than epoxides, and examining the effects of various substituents at P2 and P3 of the WRR 183 scaffold on viral replication.
