Abstract: The solution structure of contryphan-Vn, a cyclic peptide with a double cysteine S­S bridge and containing a D-tryptophan extracted from the venom of the cone snail Conus ventricosus, has been determined by NMR spectroscopy using a variety of homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR methods and restrained molecular dynamics simulations. The main conformational features of backbone contryphan-Vn are a type IV -turn from Gly 1 to Lys 6 and a type I -turn from Lys 6 to Cys 9. As already found in other contryphans, one of the two prolines--the Pro4 --is mainly in

A small hydrophobic region probably partly shielded from solvent constituted from the close proximity of side chains of Pro7 and Trp8 was observed together with a persistent salt bridge between Asp2 and Lys6, which has been revealed by the diagnostic observation of specific nuclear Overhauser effects.

INTRODUCTION
Advances in methods used for the design and the chemical synthesis of peptides have enabled the study of basic folding principles, structure­function relationships in bioactive peptides, and development of novel pharmaceutical agents.1 The synthesis and structural characterization of short peptides, constrained either via backbone cyclization, by insertion of disulfide bonds, or by chemical ligation2 provides a tool for the investigation of the role played by specific amino acid residues in the achievement of a stable conformation. Moreover, these peptides represent useful minimal model systems for the study of constrained protein loops folding.3,4 Recent NMR studies on cyclic and disulfide-constrained peptides highlighted the relevance of the number of intercysteine residues, the series of chiral centers in the backbone, and the position of constrained residues, such as Pro, in the determination of a stable conformation, leading to suggest the paradigm of "locally determined but globally selected" folding for cyclic peptides and constrained protein loops.3­5 In other words, the series of stereochemical centers present in the loop would dictate the favorable conformations while the equilibrium between different conformations would be determined by a small number of side chain interactions.4 ­ 6 A significant contribution to this view has been provided by the study of a family of short, disulfide constrained, peptides named contryphans.3,4 Contryphans are bioactive peptides, first isolated from piscivorous cone snail venom,7 which are distinctive for their richness of unusual posttranslational modifications, including Pro hydroxylation, C-terminus amidation, Leu and Trp isomerization,7,8 and Trp bromination.9 The biological activity of contryphans, assayed through intracerebroventricular injection in mice, is that of causing a stiff-tail syndrome at low

doses, while inducing seizures and death at higher doses.7,8 Up to now, nine contryphan peptides have been characterized (Table I).7,8,10,11 It has been shown that contryphan-R, contryphan-P, and contryphan-Sm exist in solution as a mixture of two conformers due to cis­trans isomerization about the N-terminal Cys­ Pro/Hyp (hydroxyproline) peptide bond. The electrostatic interaction between the charged N-terminal amino group and an anionic side chain in position 5 has been postulated to stabilize the cis conformation with respect to the trans one.4 Recently, contryphan-Vn has been purified from the venom of Conus ventricosus, the single Conus species living in the Mediterranean Sea, and its primary structure determined (Table I).11 ContryphanVn is the first conopeptide of the contryphan family for which a pharmacological target is known, as it has been recently demonstrated that it modulates the activity of Ca2 -dependent K channels in insect neurosecretory cells and rat fetal chromaffin cells.12 Contryphan-Vn shows unusual amino acid substitutions with respect to other known contryphans (Table I). In particular, contryphan-Vn displays an Asp residue at position 2, lacks the hydroxylation of Pro4, and remarkably, is characterized by the presence of the basic residue Lys6 within the intercystine loop (Table I). Molecular modeling of contryphan-Vn, based on the contryphan-R solution structure, suggested that the cis conformation of this cyclic peptide could be stabilized by a salt bridge formed by Asp2 and Lys6, which would play the same role played by the electrostatic interaction occurring between the charged N-terminal amino group and the anionic side chain at position 5 observed in contryphan-R, contryphan-P, and contryphan-Sm.3,4 Thus, contryphan-Vn would be an interesting example in which a local interaction, needed to attain a stable conformation, is conserved through structure-driven compensative mutations. Here, the solution structure of the chemically synthe-

sized contryphan-Vn, determined by NMR spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics simulations in vacuum, is reported. Further studies are in progress by molecular dynamics in water and essential analysis (paper in preparation) to study in details the effects of the motions of backbone and of the side chains of Trp residues and the role of salt bridge in the proline cis­trans isomerization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Contryphan-Vn was synthesized by the standard 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry on an automated peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Applied Biosystems) as previously described.11 Chemical identity of the natural and synthetic contryphan-Vn was confirmed by coelution of the two peptide species in reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) (LabService Analytica, Bologna, Italy), using a linear gradient of 5­ 80% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 0.2% (v/v) triflouroacetic acid (TFA) over 60 min and monitoring the absorbance at 220 nm.11 NMR experiments were performed using a 400 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer. The sample was typically 3.0 mM contryphan-Vn in 90% H2O/10% 2H2O or 100% 2H2O at 298 K and pH 3.5. Spectra were processed on Silicon Graphics workstations by the NMRPipe software13 and analyzed using NMRView.14 All the proton resonances were assigned by two-dimensional (2D) spectra: total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) (mixing time 60 ms) to identify the spin systems,15 1H­15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC),16 1H­13C heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC),17 and 1H­13C HSQCTOCSY18 to assist with cross-peaks assignment, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY)19 (with a spin-lock time of 0.050, 0.080, 0.120, and 0.150 s) according to the sequential assignment method.20 All the heteronuclear correlation experiments were carried out at natural abundance. Acquisition of a phase-sensitive correlated spectroscopy (COSY)21 was used for the assignment while the measure of backbone JHNC H and some JHC C H were directly measured from TOCSY correlation cross peaks.15 Some stereospecific assignments were also achieved.22 The structural restraints useful to determine the solution structure of contryphan-Vn have been obtained from the internuclear distances evaluated by the ROESY cross-peaks volumes measured from spectra obtained with 0.150 s of mixing time in H2O and 2H2O, and converted and grouped into distance bounds: 1.8 Å d .25 Å for strong NOEs, 1.8 Å d 3.4 Å for medium NOEs and 1.8 Å d 6.0 Å for weak NOEs.20 The data were used as obtained from direct integration without using correction for the offset dependence due to the large interval of distances derived for peak intensities. The final NMR distance restraint set consisted of 70 nonconflicting nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs). Moreover, the directly measured coupling con-

stants allowed us to determine six backbone and three side-chain dihedral constraints without further experiments.22 A series of structures was calculated for the major form of contryphan-Vn (the cis form) using the NMR data as restraints for the molecular simulations in a conventional XPLOR23 simulated annealing protocol in vacuo.24 Starting from linear template structure and different randomized initial velocity distributions, structures were subjected to all-hydrogen force field (including covalent geometry, planarity, hard sphere van der Waals, empirical NOE, and J-coupling energy terms, but not Lennard­Jones, electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and empirical dihedral angle terms). Simulated annealing was performed using a first phase consisting of 10,000 steps (2 fs each step) at 4000 K, setting the initial van der Waals weight to a very low value (0.003) to allow atoms to pass each other in the early stage of simulations. Successive 7000 steps followed to gradually cool the system to 300 K. A set of 50 structures with the least number of violations (zero or a single violation lower than 0.5 Å) were selected. Among these, PROCHECKNMR25 identified the best 20 structures with the greatest number of backbone torsion angles in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot and none in not-allowed regions (Gly1 and D-Trp5 were not included in the analysis).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As already reported, a pronounced asymmetry has been observed in the RP-HPLC profile of contryphanVn,11 suggesting the existence of an equilibrium between two stable families of conformers as found in other contryphans,3,4 attributed to the cis­trans isomerization of the Cys3­Pro4 peptide bond (the cis conformer has been supposed to be the major one).11 This hypothesis is supported by the inspection of NMR spectra (not shown), characterized by the presence of two separate sets of resonances with quite different intensities.

NMR Spectroscopy
The 1H-NMR spectrum of the major form of contryphan-Vn was completely assigned using standard procedures.20 Spectra at natural abundance of 15N and 13 C were also obtained and used to overcome ambiguities in the 1H-NMR spectra. The individual and sequential assignments have been obtained by the ROESY spectrum. The assignments of the major form are reported in Table II. The attribution of the resonances of amide protons were checked by the natural abundance HSQC spectrum where the correlation between 15N and NH proton was obtained (Figure 1). The resonances due to the minor form are clearly distinguishable but it was not possible to perform their

complete assignment. Particularly useful was also the 2D natural abundance 13C-edited HSQC-TOCSY spectrum (not shown), which led to complete assignment of side-chain carbon-linked protons (see Table II). From the complete assignment of NMR resonances, it was possible to identify the two Pro residues (at positions 4 and 7) and to determine their peptide bond conformation. Pro4 is essentially in the cis conformation, the most common found in structured proteins,28 while Pro7 was found in the trans conformation. The Pro4 cis conformation was identified by the expected characteristic sequential NOEs. A strong NOE determined by a short distance d between the Cys3 and the Pro4 residues is shown in Figure 2. In fact, in the case of the cis conformation the CH (i 1)­C Pro distance is expected to be about 2.26 Å while the CH (i 1)­C Pro distance is expected to be 4.38 ­ 4.50 Å. On the other hand, in the case of a trans conformation the CH (i 1)­ C Pro and CH (i 1)­C Pro distances are expected to be 4.2 and 2.10 ­2.39 Å, respectively.20,26 Moreover, the 13C chemical shift values of C and C resonances have been measured (Figure 3 and Table II)20,26 and are compatible with those reported in the literature for cis­trans Pro isomers (cis, C : 33 ppm, C : 23 ppm; trans, C : 30 ppm, C : 26 ppm). The complete individual and sequential assignment led to obtain the evaluation of experimental NOEs. The distribution of the experimentally detected NOEs, expressed as number of NOEs per residue and reported in parentheses along the sequence of contryphan-Vn is Gly1(1)­Asp2(9)­Cys3(6)­Pro4(7)­DTrp5(17)­Lys6(13)­Pro7(13)­Trp8(32)­Cys9(5). This result indicates that the NOEs are nearly uniformly distributed along the sequence. A particular high number of NOEs is present for residues 5­ 8, indicating a partial stiffening of the structure around

the D-Trp residue. As observed in other contryphans,3 a large backbone flexibility of contryphan-Vn has to be excluded, as large intramolecular motion(s) would lead to the partial or total cancellation of NOEs. A difference in mobility between the two Trp residues has been inferred from the number of NOEs found for the indole ring protons (5 NOEs for Trp5 and 8 NOEs for Trp8), indicating a higher mobility of Trp5. However, some conflicting results were obtained in the case of Trp residues. In fact, one NOE of D-Trp5 indole ring protons is in conflict with four NOEs (two of these are strong NOEs), indicating that the aromatic ring of this residue is in two different conformations. Similarly, four NOEs of Trp 8 indole ring with residue 9 (all weak NOEs) are in conflict with

conformation are present in contryphan-Vn in solution. Collected NOEs were translated into interprotonic distance ranges for the application of restrained molecular dynamics protocols in vacuo. Through the inclusion of backbone and dihedral angle restraints, molecular dynamics simulations generated a final set of 20 structures (Figure 4, panel a) which can be accounted for by a unique and well-defined family of backbone conformations. The average structure of this family of backbone conformations is shown in Figure 4 (panel b) while the statistic results of the structures are reported in Table III. As other members of the family, contryphan-Vn exhibits a disulfidebridged seven-residue cycle with a constrained backbone conformation. Two chain reversals are observed:

a type IV -turn from Gly1 to Lys6 and a type I -turn from Lys6 to Cys9. This result is in agreement with the experimentally measured values of the NHCH J-coupling constants (see Table II, values within brackets). By using the representation of the HN­CH J-coupling constants proposed to describe the structure of these cyclic peptides (high values, indicated by H, J 7­ 8 Hz, compatible with a -sheet conformation, and low values, indicated by L, J 6 Hz, compatible with a helical conformation),4 contryphan-Vn structure can be described by the sequence (L*,h,H,H,h,L), where L* indicates the J value found for Asp2, which is present only in contryphan-Vn. It must be noted that a lowercase "h" was used to indicate a value of 7, found for Lys6 and Cys9. This value is rather high but neither 6, typical of a helical conformation, nor 8, typical of a -sheet structure as assumed in this representation.4 Thus, the result obtained for contryphan-Vn is similar to those reported for the major form of contryphan-Sm,4 which is characterized by two forms, a major one (H,H, ,H,H,L) and a minor one ( H,L,H,L,H,L). For contryphan-R the sequence (H,H,H,H,L) has been reported.4 It must be also noted that a systematic low field shift of the CH proton resonances with respect to the random coil chemical shift values of amino acids is observed in contryphan-Vn (see Table II, values in parentheses).27 The only exception was Cys 9. This low field shift is thus well compatible with the con-

formation found, according to the chemical shift dependence on secondary structure.27 The detection of specific and strong NOEs between the -CH2 of Asp2 and the - and -CH2 of Lys6 in water (Figure 5) strongly indicates that a very stable interaction occurs between the side chains of these two residues, which sterically should result in the limitation of the mobility of Trp8 indole ring. This finding is in agreement with the chemical shift value of 3.31 ppm found for the resonance attributed to the -CH2 of Lys6, as opposed to the value statistically found in proteins of about 3.00 ppm27 ( see Table II). This difference has to be attributed either to the shielding effect of the electrons of the nearby carbonyl group, or to the ring current effect of the nearby Trp8 indole ring. It is worthwhile to note that the Asp2­Lys6 salt bridge is present in the final structures obtained from restrained molecular dynamics simulations (see Figure 6), although no explicit electrostatic contribution was included in the calculations. The backbone of the three-dimensional structure in solution of contryphanVn is similar but not identical to that of contryphan-R and contryphan-Sm.3,4 In fact, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values (calculated using InsightII29) between averaged backbone loop coordinates of contryphan-Vn and those of contryphan-R and contryphan-Sm are 0.78 and 0.92Å, respectively (see Figure 7).

Inspection of the final structure resulting from the average of the final family of structures obtained by restrained molecular dynamics simulations in vacuum indicates that Trp 8 indole should be sterically limited in motion from the existence of the experimentally detected salt bridge between the side chains of Lys 6 and Asp2. Therefore, the indole ring of Trp8 protects to some extent the Asp2­Lys6 salt bridge from the solvent. The geometry of these side-chain arrangement could play an important role in the conformational stability of contryphan-Vn that, in turn, is expected to determine its physiological function. As outlined above, the indole rings of the two Trp residues show a different numbers of NOEs giving a qualitative picture of the internal flexibility of these two residues. This feature is absent in other contryphans, though a strong electrostatic interaction is presumably present in contryphan-R and contryphan-P3,4 between the protonated N-terminus of the molecule and the anionic group of an intercysteine loop residue (Asp5 or Glu5 residue). The solution structure of contryphan-Vn has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the code 1NXN. As far as the side-chain structural features are concerned, the experimental constraints are not consistent with the uniqueness of side-chain conformation. NOE experiments, in fact, are able to give a picture of the internuclear distances in a (macro)molecule during a relatively long observation time. Thus, equilibria involving different side-chain conformation may give rise not to a unique but to an ensemble of different sets of NOEs, each one deriving from one or more of those conformers. Especially for low molecular mass cyclic peptides, where the intramolecular interactions are not so numerous, the presence of multiple side-chain conformers is well known. In the case of contryphan-Vn, significant differences are present in the conformation of Trp8 and Trp5, residues whose torsion angles 1 and 2 can assume

multiple values. Moreover, the internal dynamics of the Trp5 and Trp8 appears to be different. Trp8 is more constrained because the conformational freedom of this residue is limited by the proximity of the salt bridge between Asp2 and Lys6. This fact can be interpreted as the presence of a region of nonpolar side chains able to behave to some extent as a hydrophobic shield of the indole ring of Trp8 stabilizing the salt bridge (see Figure 6). Furthermore, a close inspection of the structure obtained from NMR data revealed that the - and -CH2 of Lys6 and the -CH of Pro4 are in proximity and close to the edge of the indole ring of Trp8. This position is the likely source of the deshielding effect observed for the corresponding resonances. In fact, the chemical shift values found for the corresponding protons in contryphan-Vn are significantly differ from the values usually found when these residues are located in a random coil conformation in proteins.27 The comparison of the solution structures of contryphan-R and contryphan-Sm3,4 and contryphan-Vn reported in Figures 7 deserves some comment as far as Pro residues conformation is concerned. All the three cyclic peptides are characterized by an N-terminal chain reversal and a C-terminal type I -turn. A salt bridge linking the N-terminal portion of the molecule and an intercysteine loop residue is observed in contryphan-R and contryphan-Vn (and inferred from NMR data also in contryphan-P), though the residue participating in its formation are different in the two peptides. In contryphan-R, the salt bridge involves the charged N-terminal amino group and the side chain of Glu5. In contryphan-Vn, Glu5, is substituted by the basic residue Lys6. However, in this case a salt bridge is formed by Lys6 and the Asp residue 2. No salt

bridge has been observed in contryphan-Sm and its absence corresponds to a lower cis­trans ratio for this peptide. Previous investigations of the cis­trans ratio in relation to charge interactions occurring in contryphan-R, contryphan-P, and contryphan-Sm led to the hypothesis that the i/i 4 electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal amino group and the charged side chain at position 5 is a major determinant of the cis­trans equilibrium of Pro residues. In detail, neutralization of the latter residue from Glu/Asp (present in position 5 in contryphan-R and -P, respectively) to Gln (present in position 5 in contryphan-Sm) reduces the cis­trans ratio from 8:1 to 3:1.4 In addition, the neutralization of the N-terminal charge in contryphanR, through acetylation, similarly reduces the ratio from 8:1 to approximately 3:1.4 In contryphan-Vn, where the same kind of i/i 4 electrostatic interaction is formed between Asp2 and Lys6, the cis­trans ratio is very similar (7:1) to that observed in contryphan-R and contryphan-P. Thus, the results presented in this article further confirm the hypothesis that charge interactions modulate the Pro cis­trans ratio in contryphans.30 Moreover, the observation of coordinated mutations occurring in contryphan-Vn that may stabilize the cis isomer represents a further indication that this isomer is the functionally relevant one. Preliminary experiments of the effect of temperature on the Pro residues cis­trans equilibrium performed by NMR spectroscopy indicated that at 298 K the cis­ trans ratio for Pro4 is about 1/0.15 while the ratio becomes 1/ 0.34 at 333 K. A more detailed study by molecular dynamics simulation in water and essential anlaysis to further characterize the side-chain conformational subfamilies of contryphan-Vn as well as the possible internal mechanism28 that determines the cis­trans isomerization equilibrium of the two Pro residues is currently in progress, in order to attempt a fine correlation between the stability of the various isomers and their role in the biological function (Amadei et al., manuscript in preparation).

simulations in water and essential dynamics analysis of trajectories are in progress to identify the collective motions in contryphan-Vn responsible for the dominant conformation in solution, for the persistence of the salt bridge, for the "solvent shielding role" of Trp8 indole ring in the stabilization of this ionic interaction in water, and finally to analyze the energy barriers and the internal motions involved in the mechanism of the cis­trans isomerization of the Pro residues (Amadei et al., manuscript in preparation).

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In conclusion, these results demonstrate that the "contryphan motif" represents a robust and conservative molecular scaffold where the main structural determinants are the size of the intercysteine loop, the presence and the location in the sequence of the D-Trp, and the two Pro residues, while side-chain substitution play a minor role in determining the backbone conformation.
