SUMMARY

Structures of intact receptors with single-pass transmembrane domains are essential to understand how extracellular and cytoplasmic domains regulate association and signaling through transmembrane domains. A chemical and computational method to determine structures of the membrane regions of such receptors on the cell surface is developed here and validated with glycophorin A. An integrin heterodimer structure reveals association over most of the lengths of the a and b transmembrane domains and shows that the principles governing association of hetero and homo transmembrane dimers differ. A turn at the Gly of the juxtamembrane GFFKR motif caps the a TM helix and brings the two Phe of GFFKR into the a/b interface. A juxtamembrane Lys residue in b also has an important role in the interface. The structure shows how transmembrane association/dissociation regulates integrin signaling. A joint ectodomain and membrane structure shows that substantial flexibility between the extracellular and TM domains is compatible with TM signaling.
INTRODUCTION Membrane proteins with a single transmembrane (TM) domain per monomer are important in transmitting signals between the extracellular and cytoplasmic environments. For example, signal transmission in receptor kinases generally involves ligandtriggered association of monomeric single-TM proteins into homodimers or heterodimers (Zhang et al., 2006). Integrins, adhesion receptors that transmit signals bidirectionally across membranes, are another heavily studied class of signaling receptors (Luo et al., 2007; Wegener and Campbell, 2008). Integrins have two subunits that constitutively heterodimerize through their large, ligand-binding extracellular domain. Reversible association through the single-pass a and b subunit

TM domains mediates TM signaling. The cytoplasmic domains are short and can bind cytoskeletal proteins. Structures are known in both active and inactive conformations for receptor kinase extracellular and cytoplasmic domain fragments (Zhang et al., 2006) and for integrin extracellular ligand-binding fragments (Luo et al., 2007) and cytoplasmic domains (Vinogradova et al., 2002). However, none of these structures include TM domains, and how signals are transmitted between these domains and across the membrane is largely unknown. In contrast, structural work on signaling proteins that span the membrane six or more times, such as channels and G protein-coupled receptors, is far more advanced. Thus far, our understanding of how single-TM proteins associate in the membrane is confined to a limited number of experimental studies on isolated TM domains. Structures of the constitutively associating TM domains of the erythrocyte glycoprotein glycophorin A (GPA) have been solved in detergent and in pelleted vesicles (MacKenzie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2001). A constitutively disulfide-linked TM dimer was also structurally defined in detergent by NMR (Call et al., 2006). Bicelles, made of a mixture of lipids and short-chain, detergent-like lipids, are closer mimics of bilayers than are detergents. Two further dimeric TM fragment structures (Bocharov et al., 2008a, 2008b) and monomeric aIIb and b3 TM domain structures (Lau et al., 2008a, 2008b) have recently been determined in bicelles. However, because regulated TM domain association is driven by domains outside of the membrane, structures of such associated TM domain fragments beg the question of whether they are physiologically relevant and, if so, whether they correspond to resting or active conformations. The biological importance of integrins and the tractability of studying regulated TM and cytoplasmic domain association in the absence of ligand, in contrast to most other signaling receptors, have made them an attractive model system for studying association of their TM and cytoplasmic domains (Wegener and Campbell, 2008). In integrins, the a and b subunit TM domains associate in the resting state, driven by the close proximity of the C termini of a and b subunit ectodomains in the bent conformation. TM and cytoplasmic domain separation, induced by binding of the b subunit cytoplasmic domain through talin to

the actin cytoskeleton, drives integrin extension and shifts the ligand-binding a/b headpiece to an open, high-affinity conformation (Luo et al., 2007; Wegener and Campbell, 2008; Zhu et al., 2008). Disulfide crosslinking of portions of the TM domains in the outer membrane leaflet demonstrates helicity and the approximate orientations between the aIIb and b3 helices in the resting state, as well as an absence of association in the active state (Luo et al., 2004). Various TM domain orientations have been proposed based on these data or mutagenesis (Gottschalk, 2005; Li et al., 2005; Partridge et al., 2005). A comprehensive NMR complex structure showed how the integrin cytoplasmic domains associated and provided a model for integrin activation by showing that the cytoskeletal protein talin dissociated the complex (Vinogradova et al., 2002). However, different a/b complex structures or a lack of association have also been described (Ulmer et al., 2001; Vinogradova et al., 2004; Weljie et al., 2002). A unique feature of integrins is a highly conserved GFFKR motif following the a subunit TM domain. Mutation of any of the residues in this motif activates integrins by destabilizing association of a and b subunit TM domains (Hughes et al., 1996; O'Toole et al., 1994). Disulfide crosslinking has been used to obtain structural information about membrane proteins, especially to probe TM domain organization and conformational change in bacterial chemoreceptors (Bass et al., 2007). However, development of this technique has not proceeded to the level of describing three-dimensional structures. Rosetta uses knowledge-based as well as physicochemical potentials and an efficient method of sampling conformational space to find low-energy structures. Furthermore, the potentials in Rosetta can be combined with experimental restraints (Das and Baker, 2008). Here, we use disulfide-based distance restraints with Membrane Rosetta (Barth et al., 2007, 2009) to characterize the structure of the TM and juxtamembrane (JM) domains in intact integrins on the cell surface. The juxtamembrane GFFKR motif in a and a juxtamembrane Lys in b form an important part of the intersubunit interface. The conclusions are supported by mutational studies. Joining an aIIbb3 ectodomain crystal structure to the membrane structure yields insights about integrin orientation on the cell surface and the finding that ectodomain flexibility is compatible with transmembrane signaling.

RESULTS Method Development We extended previous work on disulfide crosslinking of the first nine integrin TM residues (Luo et al., 2004) across the membrane and into the cytoplasm. Residues in the JM and TM segments of aIIb, b3, and GPA (Figure 1A) were individually mutated to cysteine. aIIb and b3 mutants were coexpressed in 293T transfectants. Cells were treated with or without Cu (II)-o-phenanthroline (Cu-phenanthroline) to catalyze disulfide bond formation, quenched with N-ethylmaleimide, and lysed with detergent. [35S] integrins were immunoprecipitated and subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Figures 1B­1D), and disulfide-linked heterodimer was quantitated as percentage of total integrin. Disulfide bond formation within the first few TM residues was not

increased further by Cu-phenanthroline (Figure 1B). Disulfide formation in this region and external to the membrane was also quantitated in redox buffers and after reduction with dithiothreitol followed by Cu-phenanthroline (Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 available online). By the seventh TM residue, disulfide formation was almost completely Cu-phenanthroline dependent (Figure 1C) (Luo et al., 2004), whereas by the tenth TM residue, Cu-phenanthroline alone had little effect (Figure 1D). However, disulfide crosslinking in the middle and cytoplasmic side of the membrane was made possible by freeze-thawing cells, which enables access of Cu-phenanthroline and oxygen to the otherwise reducing cytoplasmic environment (Figures 1D and 1E). Freeze-thawing had no effect on crosslinking of more exofacial residues (Figure S2). Cysteines near the membrane/ cytoplasm interface may be palmitylated and, thus, unavailable for crosslinking (Kovalenko et al., 2004). Blocking palmitylation with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) markedly enhanced crosslinking efficiency (Figure 1E). Standard crosslinking conditions thus employed 15 mg/ml 2-BP; a 1.5 hr pulse with [35S] methionine and cysteine; a 17 hr chase; freeze-thaw; and treatment with Cu-phenanthroline for 10 min at 0 C. Kinetics showed that crosslinking was maximal at 10 min, even with cysteine pairs showing only partial crosslinking (Figure S3). In cysteine crosslinking, it is thought that a thiol peroxide (S-OH) equivalent to sulfenic acid is the first oxidation product and that nucleophilic attack on the oxidized cysteine by a second, unoxidized cysteine SH group results in disulfide formation, with release of water. We hypothesize that crosslinking by the second, unoxidized cysteine is in competition with oxidation of the second cysteine, which would prevent crosslinking to the first cysteine and would account for the lack of further crosslinking after 10 min. The dependence of disulfide formation on kinetics of oxidation of the first cysteine and its limitation by the kinetics of oxidation of the second cysteine may make the extent of crosslinking relatively insensitive to kinetic differences in SH oxidation at different depths within the membrane because the first and second cysteines must be nearby and at similar depths. This hypothesis agrees with the lack of correlation between depth in the membrane and extent of crosslinking (Figure 2). Dimerization through the GPA TM domains is constitutive and is not dependent on the extracellular, O-glycosylated domain (MacKenzie et al., 1997). The aIIb and b3 ectodomains were fused to GPA residues 71­131, comprising the TM and cytoplasmic domains, or GPA residues 60­131, which include an additional 11 extracellular residues (Figure 1F). The use of aIIb GPA /b3GPA heterodimers enabled measurement of crosslinking not only between identical GPA TM residues (e.g., 80 with 80), but also between nonidentical residues (e.g., 80 with 81). Compared to wild-type aIIbb3, the aIIbb3/GPA 60­131 heterodimer was constitutively active, whereas aIIbb3/GPA 71­131 was resistant to activation (Figure 1G). These results are consistent with the importance of close association between the C termini of integrin a and b subunit ectodomains in stabilizing the resting state (Luo et al., 2007) and stronger association between the GPA than the integrin TM domains. The aIIbb3/GPA60-131 and aIIbb3/GPA71-131 chimeras gave essentially identical disulfide crosslinking (Figure 1H), showing

F727, and F730 (Figure 2A) suggest that this region is a-helical as well and interacts with the Lys and Arg residues of the GFFKR motif and several following residues in the a subunit. The GPA crosslinking data fit the GPA NMR structure well (Figure 2D), with the assumption that maximal crosslinking of 100% would be seen with maximal contact between Cys Ca ° atoms at the van der Waals distance of 3.6 A and that crosslinking would linearly fall to 0% when this distance was increased to ° 10 A (Figure 2D, solid line). Because distance is not the only factor that could affect crosslinking efficiency, it was important not to overrestrain the distance between crosslinked residues. Therefore, an upper distance bound was chosen, below which no penalty would be applied (Figures 2D and 2E, dashed lines). Restraints were used only for residue pairs with R 20% crosslinking (Figures 2D and 2E) and only for residues that did not activate ligand binding by aIIbb3 when individually mutated to cysteine (see below). Furthermore, to compensate for inherent flexibility or structural perturbations introduced by cysteine substitution, the lowest crosslinking value within two residues was subtracted prior to restraint calculation (Figure S5). Structure Refinement Rosetta has an efficient method for sampling structural diversity by assembling 3 and 9 residue fragments from the Protein Data Bank into protein structures. Fragments are selected that are similar in sequence to the target sequence and are enriched for (but do not all have) the predicted secondary structure of the target structure. Fragments are selected from high-resolution crystal structures irrespectively of whether they are membrane or water-soluble proteins. Structures are built using a Monte Carlo fragment insertion protocol, minimizing an energy function that favors hydrophobic burial, strand pairing, and other low-resolution properties of protein structures. A subsequent high-resolu-

tion refinement stage optimizes van der Waals packing, hydrogen bonding, and solvation interactions (Experimental Procedures). Membrane Rosetta uses a model of a membrane with three slabs, a central hydrophobic slab corresponding to the lipid alkyl groups and two intermediate slabs corresponding to the interface regions between the alkyl groups and the polar head groups. Both the low-resolution (Barth et al., 2009) and highresolution (Barth et al., 2007) potentials differ from water-soluble proteins in these slabs, with exposure of nonpolar groups favored rather than disfavored. The potentials for the head group regions and the external regions are the same as for watersoluble proteins. The embedding (depth and orientation) of proteins in the membrane slab is optimized to give the lowest energy. Disulfide distance restraints are incorporated as an additional potential term used to evaluate model energy; a distance greater than the upper bound shown in Figures 2D and 2E raises energy. This energy term is evaluated in every Monte Carlo step and thus affects the course of model building. Building the integrin TM and juxtamembrane domains was done in several stages, as detailed in the Experimental Procedures and the Supplemental Data. In the final stage, all models with the 10% lowest energy were clustered by structural similarity (Figures S6 and S7). The vast majority of low-energy structures have similar structural features (Figure S7). Structure assessment below uses the structures at the center of the largest (top) GPA and integrin clusters (referred to as final structures), the structural ensembles within the top clusters (Tables 1 and 2), and the centers of the top five clusters (Figure S7). Structure Assessment Cross-validation with omitted restraints is used for the validation of crystal and NMR structures (Brunger et al., 1993). GPA and

integrin models generated without restraints were far from the GPA NMR and integrin final models (Figures 3 and S8). When 12.5% restraints were used, models were much closer. When 25% and 50% restraints were used, the models approached ° ° a plateau in Ca RMSD for integrin of 1 A for TM and 1.8 A for ° for GPA (Figures 3A, 3C, TM + cytoplasmic domains and 0.8 A and 3E). This provides one estimate of structure accuracy. Crystal structure accuracy is evaluated by omitting data from refinement and checking the agreement between the omitted data and the final structure (Rfree). Similarly, we checked structures for violations of restraints that were not used in structure generation (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E). When 50% of restraints were used in structure generation, there was little violation of the other 50% of omitted restraints (Figures 3B, 3D, and 3E). These results suggest that, at least for the regions of the structures that are well covered by restraints, i.e., the TM regions, the structures match the actual structure well. The solid-state GPA NMR structure, which fits the solution-state restraints better than the solution NMR structure (Smith et al., 2001), fits the solution-state NMR and Disulfide/Rosetta structures, ° respectively, with Ca RMSD of 0.97 ± 0.10 and 0.96 ± 0.15 A (see Table 2 for more details). These results show that the Disulfide/Rosetta structure is as similar to the solid-state NMR structure as the latter is to the solution-state NMR structure. The similarities between the Disulfide/Rosetta and NMR structures extend to details including side-chain rotamers (Figures 3G and 3H). For example, side chains in crosslinking peaks have identical rotamers, except for Leu-90 and Ile-91 in one of the two Disulfide/ Rosetta TM helices (Figure 3H), which, in contrast to the solidstate NMR structure, were not constrained to be symmetric. The final aIIbb3 membrane structure showed no restraint violation (Figure 2E), and the ensemble showed little restraint violation (Table 1). Furthermore, crosslinking data from activating cysteine mutations that were omitted from structure calculation also did not violate restraints and trended well with the idealized crosslinking-distance relationship (Figure 2E and Table S1). The apparent lack of effect on crosslinking by these activating mutations may result from the use of 0 C and 37 C in crosslinking and activation assays, respectively. aIIbb3 Membrane Structure and Comparison to Mutational Results All low-energy aIIbb3 structures have the same interhelical interface, and almost all have the Gly of GFFKR in a left-handed helix conformation that caps the aIIb a helix and brings the two Phe of GFFKR into the interface with the b3 a helix (Figures 4A­4E, S7A, and S7B). These key features are seen in all five top clusters with ° clustering at 2.0 A (Figure S7A) and four out of five of the top clus-

° ters at 3.0 A (Figure S7B). The sole exception, cluster 3 with clus° tering at 3.0 A (Figure S7B), has the highest disulfide restraint violation (Figure S6B) and can be ruled out because it is incompatible with mutational data described below that show that the aIIb GFFKR motif and b3 Lys-716 have an important role in the aIIb/b3 interface. The b3 TM a helix continues as a helix into the cytoplasm (Figure 4B), and in some clusters, the cytoplasmic portion of the b3 TM a helix is divided into two segments separated by a turn near Glu-726 (Figure S7). The integrin TM domains associate with a right-handed crossing angle of À37 compared to À41 to À45 in GPA (Table 1) (MacKenzie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2001). The most prominent features of a-helical surfaces are ridges formed by the side chains of every fourth residue in sequence (i + 4n) and grooves in between (Figure 4F). In a common packing mode between adjacent a helices, observed for a helices that cross at angles of À50 ± 20 , a ridge formed by residues i + 4n on one helix fits into a groove on another helix between the ridges formed by residues j + 4n and j + 1 + 4n (Chothia et al., 1981). This has been termed ``4-4 packing.'' The aIIb and b3 TM a helices show precisely this packing mode (Figures 4F and 4H). The ridge is on aIIb and is formed by residues W968, G972, G976, and L980. The groove is on b3 between residues V696 and L697, V700 and M701, I704 and L705, and G708 and L709 (Figure 4H). Residues in crosslinking peaks are found at the interface (Figures 4C, 4D, and 4H). Because the ridges and grooves spiral on the side of the cylindrical a helix, they are convex. The G972-XXX-G976 motif in aIIb decreases the height of the ridge at the center of the packing interface, enabling the two helical cylinders to pack closer together. In the NMR and cell-surface GPA structures, the TM helices pack most closely together at a GXXXG motif (MacKenzie et al., 1997) (Figures 3H and 4I). Two differences in interhelical orientation with integrins are apparent when the grooves in b3 and one of the GPA monomers are superimposed (Figure 4G). First, although packing in GPA resembles ridge in groove (MacKenzie et al., 1997), the two low ridges bearing G79 and G80 move closer to one another than in integrin (horizontally in Figure 4I), providing more separation from the high ridges bearing V80 and V84. Second, the ridge in the integrin slides in its groove relative to GPA (vertically in Figure 4H) so that the spacing of residues in the interface differs (Figures 4H and 4I). Mutational studies are in excellent agreement with the interhelical integrin interface identified here. Cysteine and leucine scanning show that the most activating and, hence, structurally disruptive mutations within the TM domains are of the three interfacial Gly residues: aIIb Gly-972, aIIb Gly-976, and b3 Gly-708 (Figure 5A) (Luo et al., 2005). By contrast, mutations of aIIb

Gly-975 and b3 Gly-702, which are not interfacial (Figures 4D and 4H), are not activating (Figure 5A). These results correlate with the observations that the interfacial, but not the noninterfacial, Gly residues are invariantly small (Gly, Ala, or Ser) residues in integrin TM domains (Figure S10). The GFFKR motif has a structural role in aIIbb3 association consonant with its long-known functional importance. The aIIb TM a helix extends beyond the 23 residue TM hydrophobic segment through Lys-989 and Val-990. However, at Gly-991 of the GFFKR motif, the backbone adopts a left-handed rather than right-handed a-helical conformation (Figure 4E). Gly in left-handed conformation at the C termini of a helices is the most common C-cap motif and is responsible for the marked overrepresentation of Gly at the +1 position following a helices (Richardson and Richardson, 1989). Almost all (91%) low-energy models and all but one outlier cluster (Figure S7) have a turn at the Gly (Figure S11). Many of these models, including the final structure, have Phi/Psi angles for this Gly that are disallowed for non-Gly residues (Figure S11), potentially explaining why mutation of this residue is so destabilizing. The turn at the Gly brings the two Phe residues of the GFFKR motif into the interface between the aIIb and b3 TM a helices (Figure 4E). The aIIb and b3 TM a helices are further apart near this interface than anywhere else in the membrane, and Phe-993 in particular occupies space between the two helices and is central in the interface. Phe-993 contacts on the b3 subunit Leu-712 and is nearby the aliphatic portion of Lys-716. In the aIIb subunit, Phe-993 abuts Met-987 and Phe-992. Both Phe side chains orient toward the hydrophobic core of the membrane. A meander in the aIIb cytoplasmic domain containing the Lys and Arg of the GFFKR motif and three more C-terminal residues abuts the b3 cytoplasmic a helix. Mutational data support the juxtamembrane aIIb structure. Cysteine substitutions in the GFFKR motif are activating (Figure 5A), emphasizing the important role of this motif in the juxtamembrane interface between the aIIb and b3 subunits. Mutation of FF of GFFKR to AA, YY, WW, or LL demonstrated that even the aromatic substitutions YY and WW are activating (Figure 5B). These results are consistent with the important packing role, particularly of Phe-993, in the aIIbb3 interface and not with the general role that aromatic residues, particularly Trp, often play in the hydrophobic/polar membrane interface. In the b3 juxtamembrane domain, residues Lys-716, Ile-719, and Asp-723 are in the interface with the aIIb GFFKR motif (Figures 2A and 4E). Remarkably, the Lys-716 3-amino group hydrogen bonds to the aIIb backbone (Figure 4E). Hydrogen bonds to either or both of the aIIb Phe-992 and Lys-994 carbonyls, with Phe-992 predominating, are found in 31% of all

low-energy models, 65% of the cluster 1 ensemble, and in five out of nine of the cluster center models shown in Figure S7 that have the turn at Gly-991. Cysteine scanning of b3 showed that the only activating mutation in the juxtamembrane/cytoplasmic domain is K716C (Figure 5A). Furthermore, this mutation is more activating than the single other activating Cys mutation identified, G708C in the TM domain. These results confirm the important structural role of Lys-716 in the aIIbb3 interface. b3 Lys-716 was also mutated to Ser, Arg, Glu, Leu, and Pro. All substitutions were activating except for Arg (Figure 5B), the only other side chain that could form a similar hydrogen bond to an aIIb backbone carbonyl oxygen, and is found at this position in integrin b subunits (Figure S10). Mutation showed that, in contrast to Arg, polar (Ser, Glu) and aliphatic (Leu) side chains could not substitute for Lys-716. These findings lend credence to the hydrogen bond between the b3 Lys-716 side chain and the aIIb backbone. Arg-995 of the aIIb GFFKR motif is nearby both b3 Asp-723 and Glu-726 (Figure 4E), consistent with the proposal based on mutational studies of a salt bridge between Arg-995 and Asp723 (Hughes et al., 1996). However, the side chains of Arg-995 and Asp-723 sample a large conformational space and are within hydrogen-bonding distance in only 30% of the cluster 1 structural ensemble and 16% of low-energy structures (Table S2). We have consistently observed little effect of mutation of b3 Asp-723, the putative salt bridge partner of aIIb Arg-995 in either 293T transfectants (Figures 5A and 5B) or transient CHO-K1 transfectants (Figure 5C). Because Asp-723 mutants have been found to be active in stable CHO transfectants (Hughes et al., 1996), this may reflect differences in levels of cell-surface density or in assay sensitivity. Structure of the Full-Length aIIbb3 Integrin Models of the entire receptor were generated by assembling the structures of the TM + cytoplasmic domains with the ectodomain crystal structure (Zhu et al., 2008). Redox buffer disulfide restraints were used in the 6 residue aIIb and 4 residue b3 linkers between these segments (Figure S1B and Table S3B). Restraints were validated based on crosslinking between nearby residues defined in aIIbb3 and aVb3 crystal structures; because of flexibility in crystal structures of the b3 tail domain (Zhu et al., 2008), restraints were loosened relative to the TM region (Figure S12). The linkers were modeled while simultaneously optimizing the rigid body orientation of the ectodomain with respect to the membrane. Two long, disordered loops at the membrane-proximal base of the aIIb calf-2 domain were included as flexible loops

In (A), (C), and (E), models were compared over Ca atoms to the final structure made with all restraints, and, in the case of GPA, also to the GPA NMR structure. By definition, models made with 100% of restraints are identical to the final structure. In (B), (D), and (F), models generated with a subset of restraints were scored for violation of the omitted restraints, i.e., those not used in model generation. The per residue RMS distance violation, i.e., distance above the upper bound (see Figures 2D and 2E), is shown. How well the models satisfy omitted restraints is a measure of model accuracy similar to the Rfree value in crystallography.

in models because they may impact orientation on the cell surface. The lowest-energy models exhibit a diversity of ectodomain orientations (Figure 6A). However, the range of orientations was more restricted than would be imposed solely by the physical barrier of the membrane bilayer. These results show that the TM and linker regions do not completely restrict the orientation of the ectodomain, which is still able to explore a substantial amount of conformational space. This is an important finding because it shows that models of signal transmission between the integrin ecto and TM domains have to be compatible with substantial flexibility at the interfaces between these domains. DISCUSSION Structures for Intact Receptors with Two Associating TM Domains There are currently no crystal or NMR structures of intact signaling receptors with a single transmembrane domain per monomer. NMR studies to date have been on small fragments of subunits that either constitutively associate (Call et al., 2006; MacKenzie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2001) or undergo regulated association but are devoid of the regulating extracellular domains (Bocharov et al., 2008a, 2008b). Even the two fragment structures that nominally represent regulated receptors may be special cases because the EphA1 receptor dimerizes in SDS, and ErbB2 physiologically only forms heterodimers, not homodimers. NMR experiments on fragments are capable of yielding more detailed structural information, but not of defining for regulated receptors whether the conformations that are experimentally captured are physiologically relevant and whether they correspond to ``on'' or ``off'' states. The method developed here is complementary because it characterizes structures in the presence of extracellular and cytoplasmic domains that regulate transmembrane association in intact receptors on the cell surface. The method is applicable to a large class of signaling receptors that have a single transmembrane domain per monomer or subunit and undergo regulated dimerization. Our method combines sparse experimental data (disulfide restraints) with energy terms in Rosetta analogously to how experimental and energy terms are used in NMR and crystal model building, except that there are more energy terms in Rosetta. In crystal and NMR structures, energy terms for bond angles and distances and van der Waals repulsion are generally used; additional energy terms may be used in lower-resolution structures. In lower-resolution crystal and NMR structures, there is less experimental data, and the energy terms receive more weight. We may similarly think of the Membrane Rosetta models

made here as low-resolution structures because the weight of the energy terms relative to the experimental data is high. Our GPA ensemble is as close to the solid-state NMR structure as the solution-state NMR ensemble is to the solid-state structure. The GPA Disulfide/Rosetta structure suggests that the GPA TM domain NMR structures determined in dodecylphosphocholine detergent (MacKenzie et al., 1997) and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar dispersions (Smith et al., 2001) are similar to the GPA TM domain structure on the cell surface. Methods for validating structures with sparse experimental data such as reported here are an important area for further development (Das and Baker, 2008). However, analogous to cross-validation in NMR or omission of data from refinement of crystal structures (Rfree) (Brunger et al., 1993), we have used restraint omission to attempt to evaluate the accuracy of our in° tegrin structure. The estimated RMSD Ca accuracy is 1 A for the ° TM portion of the integrin and 0.8 A for GPA, which is comparable to the RMSD between our GPA membrane structure and the NMR structure. The lack of restraint violation by mutationally important residues that were omitted from the structure refinement provides further support for our integrin structure. Previous experience with Rosetta has shown that structural features are most accurately modeled when shared by the majority of low-energy structures and when alternative lowenergy structures can also be ruled out by experimental data (Das and Baker, 2008). Consequently, we have focused not on a single structure but on the overall characteristics of the 10% lowest-energy structures. We have only emphasized conclusions when they were validated by a majority of low-energy structures and when alternatives could be ruled out. The most critical example of this is the GFFKR motif. We obtained restraints between the aIIb and b3 TM helices preceding GFFKR and between the helical JM portion of b3 and the K and R residues of GFFKR and several following residues. Thus, low-energy structures of the GFF moiety had to be found by Rosetta that were consistent with these restraints. The structure of the GFF moiety illustrates one of the strengths of Rosetta, which uses a large library of fragments from high-resolution structures. The most common C-cap motif for a helices involves a Gly in lefthanded helical conformation (Richardson and Richardson, 1989), and the backbone hydrogen bonds in this motif include the first F in GFFKR (Figure 4E). Thus, this conformation was readily found, and 91% of low-energy structures were built including this motif. The other 9% of structures continued in right-handed a-helical conformation through the G and do not have GFF in aIIb and K716 in b3 in the interface. These structures can be ruled out because mutational studies show that GFF in

of satisfying disulfide restraints between aIIb and b3 residues on either side of the GFF motif (Figure S7B), presenting yet another criterion for discarding this model. Therefore, we conclude that

Molecular Cell
Structure in the Membrane of Integrin aIIbb3

both the TM and JM portions of our aIIbb3 membrane structure are strongly supported. The Integrin TM Interface Our study definitively identifies the interface between the aIIb and b3 TM a helices. Previous disulfide crosslinking of the first nine residues of the TM domains established only the approximate orientation between their helices and did not include the second G of the GXXXG motif (Luo et al., 2004). Based on that data, approximate orientations between the aIIb and b3 TM helices (Lau et al., 2008a) or detailed models (Gottschalk, 2005) have subsequently been presented. As an example of the lack of sufficiency of the previous data, the detailed model has an Ca RMSD ° of 2.7 A over 44 TM residues and does not follow the ridge-ingroove packing we describe in the inner-half of the membrane (Gottschalk, 2005). Subsequent to Luo et al. (2004), another group used a different approach and produced two models that superimpose on our structure over 44 TM residues with ° Ca RMSD of 6.8 and 8.0 A (Partridge et al., 2005). Thus, there has previously been no consensus on the orientation between the aIIb and b3 TM domains. Compared to previous homodimer TM structures, the integrin TM heterodimer structure illustrates the important principle that ridge-in-groove packing in heterodimers is not constrained by symmetry, enabling packing of the ridge at intermediate positions in the groove not allowed in symmetric homodimers (vertically in Figures 4H and 4I). This finding is likely to reflect general differences between homodimeric and heterodimeric TM domain association. Many single-span receptors, such as the EGFR/ErbB family, can associate either as homo or heterodimers. ErbB family heterodimers have an important role in signaling, and their TM domains associate more stably than the corresponding homodimers (Duneau et al., 2007). It will be interesting to compare homo and heterodimers within a single receptor family to determine whether differences in packing modes between homo and heterodimers regulate the stability or signaling of TM domains. Whereas association between GPA TM domains is constitutive and occurs even in SDS, association between the integrin TM domains is regulated and labile to detergents (Li et al., 2001; MacKenzie et al., 1997). The finding here that integrin ectodomain fusion directly to the GPA TM/cytoplasmic domains in the aIIbb3 /GPA 71­131 chimera results in resistance to activation is compatible with the greater stability of the GPA dimer. This stability is not related to surface area buried in the interface, ° ° which with a 1.4 A radius probe is 780 A2 for GPA, compared ° ° to 1050 A2 for the TM domain portion of integrin and 1300 A2 when the membrane-embedded JM portion is included. The b-branched residues, Ile, Thr, and Val, which only have one available rotamer in a helices, are present in the GPA TM domain interface. This minimizes loss of entropy when these residues are transferred from the lipid environment to a protein interface (Liu et al., 2003; MacKenzie et al., 1997). By contrast, integrins have a substantial number of interfacial Leu and Met residues, for which the conformational entropy loss upon TM helix-helix association will be much greater. Furthermore, hydrogenbonded Thr residues stabilize the GPA, but not the integrin interface (MacKenzie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2001).

The JM Interface and Comparison of Associated and Dissociated Integrin Subunits The juxtamembrane aIIbb3 structure is most unusual. The aIIb a helix is terminated by a turn at the Gly of GFFKR motif that brings its Phe residues into the interface with the b3 subunit and partially embeds them in the hydrophobic portion of the membrane bilayer. Furthermore, a Lys residue immediately following the b3 TM hydrophobic segment also participates in the interface with aIIb. These key structural findings are all supported by mutational studies. Our study demonstrates the importance of juxtamembrane segments in dimerization. Previous homodimeric NMR structures of associating TM domains (Bocharov et al., 2008a, 2008b; Call et al., 2006; MacKenzie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2001) show different packing modes between two TM a helices but do not contain additional segments that contribute to packing within the membrane. JM amphipathic segments intervene between TM domains and intracellular signaling domains in many receptors, including the epidermal growth factor receptor, and thus may be of key importance in signal transduction (McLaughlin et al., 2005). The demonstration here that the integrin a subunit GFFKR motif is an amphipathic, JM segment that directly participates in the association between the a and b TM domains raises the intriguing possibility that amphipathic JM segments in other receptors may participate in dimerization interactions between their TM domains. Careful studies by Ulmer et al. have described the NMR structures of isolated aIIb and b3 TM/cytoplasmic domain fragments in bicelles (Lau et al., 2008a, 2008b). In contrast to findings that similar aIIb and b3 constructs formed homomultimers in detergents (Li et al., 2001), Ulmer and coworkers found that these subunits were monomeric in the more bilayer-like bicelle environment. Comparisons between the isolated peptide and membrane complex structures show a remarkable similarity in the aIIb structures in the GFFKR motif (Figures 6B­6D); it should be noted that no information from the monomer structures was used in the calculation of the aIIbb3 complex structure. The backbone conformation is identical through the GFFKR motif to Lys994, which is the last structured residue in the bicelle aIIb structure (Lau et al., 2008a). The same hydrogen bonds that support the turn at Gly-991, between the backbone O atom of Met-987 and N atoms of Gly-991 and Phe-992, are found in both structures and, in general, in the C-cap motif with Gly in left-handed helical conformation (Richardson and Richardson, 1989). Moreover, Phe-993, which is central in the aIIbb3 complex structure and has a well-defined rotamer in the aIIb structure, has the same rotamer in the complex structure (Figures 6B­6D). The isolated aIIb and b3 TM domain structures provide the basis for comparisons to our complex structure. There is no precedent for association between TM monomers, one of which has a significant juxtamembrane segment that associates with the a-helical TM segment. It was unknown whether the aIIb juxtamembrane segment would alter conformation after association. Indeed, there was good reason to expect that the conformation of the aIIb GFFKR segment would alter after association with b3 because, as pointed out (Lau et al., 2008a), residues in this motif were found to be in a-helical conformation in an aIIbb3 complex NMR structure containing the entire GFFKR

motif and two preceding residues (Vinogradova et al., 2002). Thus, it is surprising that the only significant difference between the structured portions of the peptide and complex structures is a difference in tilt between the TM and JM segments. This ° tilt brings Phe-993 in monomeric aIIb 2 A closer to Val-984 to pack against it in van der Waals contact (Figure 6D). In the aIIbb3 complex, b3 Leu-712 contacts aIIb Val-984, and there is not room for Phe-993 to come as close (Figure 6C). Thus,

some conformational adjustments must occur between the associated and dissociated states of the aIIb subunit. Another interesting juxtamembrane feature is the side chainbackbone intersubunit hydrogen bond donated by the b3 Lys716 side chain. A caveat is that this hydrogen bond appears in only 65% of structures in the ensemble. However, the presence of such a bond is strongly supported by the ability of Arg, but not other amino acids, to substitute for Lys. This bond is to the aIIb

backbone near the end of the GFFKR motif and thus stabilizes both a b association and GFFKR conformation. In our structure, Lys-716 is by far the most important b3 residue for interaction with aIIb in the JM region, and it is fitting that b3 Lys-716 and the aIIb GFFKR motif, which interact with one another, are the sites where mutations are most disruptive to a b interaction. Arg and Lys are abundant at the boundary between TM and cytoplasmic domains, where they determine the polarity of membrane insertion by the positive-inside rule (von Heijne, 1992); thus, though Lys and Arg are of general importance, a specific role for b3 Lys-716 was unanticipated. Comparison to Previous Complex Structures Surprisingly, our results disagree with a prominent NMR structure of the aIIbb3 JM/cytoplasmic complex (Vinogradova et al., 2002). There is no similarity whatsoever in the interfaces between the NMR complex structure in aqueous media and our cellsurface complex structure (Figure S13A). The previous comprehensive study showed that mutations that activate integrins disrupted the aIIbb3 complex and that the talin head domain bound to the b3 JM/cytoplasmic fragment and disrupted its complex with the aIIb JM/cytoplasmic fragment (Vinogradova et al., 2002). Other NMR studies have yielded conflicting results. Refinement by one group did not converge on a single NMR structure but on two different structures (Weljie et al., 2002), neither of which is in agreement with that of Vinogradova et al. (2002) or described here (Figures S13B and S13C). Furthermore, the same aIIb JM/cytoplasmic fragments that associated in aqueous media were found not to associate in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine (Vinogradova et al., 2004). Moreover, a lack of complex formation has been reported even with proximity enforced by fusion of aIIb and b3 JM/cytoplasmic fragments to coiled coils (Ulmer et al., 2001). In retrospect, perhaps it is not surprising that none of the NMR structures resemble the Disulfide/Rosetta structure (Figure S13). The two Phe residues of the GFFKR motif pack in the hydrophobic lipid environment and in an interface against the side chains of the a and b TM helices, all of which are missing in the discrepant structures. The lack of appropriate structure of the juxtamembrane/cytoplasmic segments when isolated from the TM segments and the lack of association between the a and b TM segments in intact cells when the GFFKR motif is deleted (Luo et al., 2004) demonstrate cooperativity between these segments for folding and assembly, consistent with their intimate interaction in the Disulfide/Rosetta structure. Integrin Structure on the Cell Surface Using a crystal structure of the aIIbb3 extracellular domain (Zhu et al., 2008), the aIIbb3 membrane structure, and disulfide restraints on the short extracellular linkers, we characterized the structure of intact aIIbb3 on the cell surface. Multiple lowenergy orientations between the extracellular and transmembrane domains were found. This finding suggests that the orientation of integrins on the cell surface is dynamic rather than fixed and that the 6 residue aIIb and 4 residue b3 linkers between the extracellular and TM domains are flexible. The lack of a fixed structure for this region is consistent with marked variation in the sequence and length of these linkers, particularly among

integrin a subunits. For example, the aV subunit, which also associates with b3, has an 8 residue QPAPMPVP linker compared to the 6 residue EERAIP linker in aIIb. In contrast to our results, a cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of native aIIbb3 in octylglucoside detergent suggested a defined, extended orientation between the extracellular and TM domains (Adair and Yeager, 2002). However, the cryoEM extracellular domain structure does not agree with that determined in crystals or negative stain (Zhu et al., 2008), and it has been suggested that the cryoEM structure may have averaged over bent and extended integrin conformations (Luo et al., 2007). Our finding that limited, but not extensive, flexibility between the extracellular and TM domain is compatible with signal transduction has important implications. Flexibility and variation in the ectodomain-TM domain linkers are compatible with activation by large-scale movements such as separation in the plane of the membrane between the TM domains (Luo et al., 2004), but not with small-scale twisting or pistoning motions with which the linkers could comply. On the other hand, extreme flexibility in the linkers decouples extracellular domain activation from the TM domains, as shown here by the aIIbb3 /GPA 60­131 chimera and previously by insertion of artificial linkers (Xiong et al., 2003). Decoupling likely arises because long, flexible linkers enable integrin ectodomain extension and activation even when the TM domains remain associated. Inside-Out Activation of Integrins Ligand binding by integrins can be activated by binding of the actin cytoskeleton to the b cytoplasmic domain. Two classes of cytoskeleton-associated proteins mediate this linkage, talin and kindlins (Moser et al., 2008; Wegener and Campbell, 2008). Talin and kindlin bind through their FERM domains to NPXY motifs at b3 residues 744­747 and 756­759, respectively. Talin also binds to more membrane-proximal b3 regions, including Phe-727 and Phe-730 (Wegener et al., 2007). The Disulfide/Rosetta structure shows that these residues are in the b3 a helix and face the aIIb cytoplasmic tail. Superposition of the talin b3 and aIIbb3 complexes demonstrates that talin clashes with aIIb residues that interact with the b3 a helix and immediately follow the GFFKR motif, i.e., aIIb residues N996­ P998 (Figure 6E). However, the position of the segment with talin-binding residues Phe-727 and Phe-730 is not well defined, given that some clusters show two helices in the b3 cytoplasmic domain separated by a turn near Glu-726 (Figures S7A and S7B). Furthermore, the talin complex structure shows a loss of helicity in b3 N terminal to His-722, and isolated b3 in bicelles loses a helicity after residue His-722 (Lau et al., 2008b). Thus, it is plausible either that talin binding to b3 would perturb its association with aIIb or that flexibility in the b3 a helix between its sites of association with aIIb and talin would eliminate clashes in a talin/aIIbb3 complex. Because the evidence that talin interferes with association between aIIb and b3 comes from an NMR study on a complex that our results suggest is nonphysiologic, the mechanism by which talin activates integrins requires further structural study. Once integrins bind through talins or kindlins to actin filaments, lateral force exerted by the cytoskeleton will favor an extended integrin conformation with the hybrid domain in b swung out in

the direction of the pulling force in the open conformation with high affinity for ligand (Zhu et al., 2008). This mechanism can explain activation by talin as well as by kindlins, which bind to an NPXY motif that is distal from the aIIb/b3 interface (Moser et al., 2008). Lateral force would tilt the dissociated b3 TM domain in the plane of the membrane. The long continuous a helix seen in the dissociated b3 TM domain is well suited to tilting (Lau et al., 2008b). We have described the structure of an intact receptor containing two TM domains on the cell surface. The results shed important light on the structural basis for transmembrane signaling through integrins, demonstrate that the principles differ for association between heterodimeric and homodimeric TM domains, and demonstrate that JM domains can have an important role in TM domain association. The method can be extended to many other important classes of cell-surface receptors with two associating TM domains and can yield information on how regulated changes in the association state of the TM domains transmit signals between the extracellular and intracellular environments.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Disulfide Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation The 293T transfectants were pretreated with 15 mg/ml of 2-BP for 1 hr, labeled with [35S] cysteine/methionine (10 mCi/ml, PerkinElmer Life Science) for 1.5 hr, and chased for 17 hr. Cells were detached and kept intact or broken by freezethaw, treated on ice with 200 mM CuSO4/1000 mM o-phenanthroline for 10 min, treated with 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min, and lysed in 2% Triton X-100. Lysate supernatants were immunoprecipitated with anti-b3 mAb AP3 and protein G agarose and subjected to nonreducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Radioactivity was quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Crosslinking efficiency was quantitated as disulfide-linked heterodimer as percentage of heterodimer plus aIIb and b3 monomers. For constitutively crosslinked residues, crosslinking was also measured after 1 hr in 5 mM cysteamine/1 mM cystamine redox buffer and after DTT treatment followed by Cu-phenanthroline. Details are in the Supplemental Data. Membrane Structure Generation The energy terms used in Membrane Rosetta (Barth et al., 2007, 2009) include a Lennard-Jones potential, a backbone torsional term, a knowledge-based pairwise interaction term between amino acid residues, a penalty term for the disulfide restraints that is proportional to distance beyond the upper bound, an implicit Lazaridis-Karplus solvation term for the aqueous and hydrophobic environments (with the hydrophobic potential based on experimental transfer-free energies from water to cyclohexane), and an orientation-dependent hydrogen-bonding term. Models are first built with centroids for side chains and are then refined in all-atom mode. The all-atom mode membrane ° environment has an inner, slab-shaped, 24 A thick, isotropic, hydrophobic phase representing the lipid alkyl groups, outer isotropic phases representing ° the head group and membrane-external regions, and, in between, two 10 A thick, anisotropic phases representing the interface region where alkyl, acyl, and glycerol groups are located. The centroid membrane environment is similar but replaces each anisotropic slab with two isotropic slabs. The solvation and hydrogen bond potentials differ in the hydrophobic and aqueous environments and are interpolated in the interface region. The hydrogen bond potential includes weak CaH-O bonds and bifurcated hydrogen bonds. The position of models in the membrane slab is varied to find the lowest-energy embedding. Structures were built in several stages. First, 12 residue ideal helices were docked. Then, all but two residues of each helix were discarded, and chain growing with fragment assembly was used to build longer structures that could, in principle, have any secondary structure. A total of two (GPA) or three

(integrin) chain-growing stages were used, alternating in N-to-C and C-to-N direction, and previously built residues were discarded in each stage so that no remnants from the first one (GPA) or two stages (integrin) were present in the final structures (Figure S6). Approximately 10,000 models were generated in each stage. Disulfide restraints were used as part of the total energy function in each Monte Carlo step within each chain-growing stage. Furthermore, between each stage, the 100 models used as seeds for the next stage were selected by the independent criteria of low restraint violation and low energy (in this case, energy did not include the restraint violation penalty). The stages are summarized in more detail in Figure S6 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Structures are provided in the Supplemental Data. Modeling the Intact Integrin in the Membrane Bilayer To provide starting TM structures, we performed one additional stage of chain growing from the TM regions to grow the linker regions, using redox buffer disulfide restraints for the linker region and distance restraints for the two C-terminal residues present in aIIb and b3 in the crystal structure (Zhu et al., 2008). After joining these TM structures to the crystal structure, the two linkers were simultaneously remodeled with Membrane Rosetta using the linker disulfide restraints to find low-energy orientations with respect to the membrane (Supplemental Data). Two long, membrane-proximal loops in the calf-2 domain that are disordered in the crystal structure were included in the models. Ligand-Binding Assay Ligand mimetic IgM PAC-1 (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and FITClabeled human fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) binding to transfected cells was as described (Luo et al., 2004). SUPPLEMENTAL DATA Supplemental Data include Supplemental Experimental Procedures, 13 figures, 5 tables, and 3 sets of structure coordinates and can be found with this article online at http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/supplemental/ S1097-2765(09)00138-5.
