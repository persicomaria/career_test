ABSTRACT: The conformation of the trans-anti-(1S,2R,3S,4R)-N2-[1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2,3,4-trihydroxybenz[a]anthracenyl)]-2-deoxyguanosyl adduct in d(G 1 G 2 C 3 A 4 G 5 X 6 T 7 G 8 G 9 T 10 G 11 ), 12A13C14C15A16C17C18T19G20C21C22), bearing codon 12 of the human N-ras protooncogene (underlined), d(C was determined. This adduct had S stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon. Its occurrence in DNA is a consequence of trans opening by the deoxyguanosine amino group of (1R,2S,3S,4R)-1,2-epoxy-1,2,3,4tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracenyl-3,4-diol. The resonance frequencies, relative to the unmodified DNA, of the X6 H1 and H6 protons were shifted downfield, whereas those of the C18 and T19 H1, H2, H2, and H3 deoxyribose protons were shifted upfield. The imino and amino resonances exhibited the expected sequential connectivities, suggesting no interruption of Watson-Crick pairing. A total of 426 interproton distances, including nine uniquely assigned BA-DNA distances, were used in the restrained molecular dynamics calculations. The refined structure showed that the benz[a]anthracene moiety bound in the minor groove, in the 5-direction from the modified site. This was similar to the (+)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyreneN2-dG adduct having S stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon [Cosman, M., De Los Santos, C., Fiala, R., Hingerty, B. E., Singh, S. B., Ibanez, V., Margulis, L. A., Live, D., Geacintov, N. E., Broyde, S., and Patel, D. J. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 1914-1918]. It differed from the (-)-trans-antibenzo[c]phenanthrene-N2-dG adduct having S stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon, which intercalated in the 5-direction [Lin, C. H., Huang, X., Kolbanovskii, A., Hingerty, B. E., Amin, S., Broyde, S., Geacintov, N. E., and Patel, D. J. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 306, 1059-1080]. The results provided insight into how PAH molecular topology modulates adduct structure in duplex DNA.

Benz[a]anthracene (BA),1 a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), is a component of coal tar, atmospheric pollution, automobile exhaust (1, 2), and cigarette smoke (3). Its genotoxicity is generally recognized to result from stepwise oxidation by cytochromes P450 (4, 5) to stereoiso This work was supported by NIH Grant ES-05355.

meric bay region diol epoxides, which represent the proximate mutagenic and carcinogenic species. BA is less genotoxic than the well-known PAH benzo[a]pyrene. This has been attributed to less efficient enzymatic oxidation of BA in formation of the bay region diol epoxide (6). However, once formed, the BA bay region diol epoxides are mutagens in bacteria (7) and in Chinese hamster V79 cells (8). They are tumorigenic in mouse skin assays (8, 9). The BA bay region diol epoxides react at nucleophilic sites on the DNA nucleobases, and particularly at the guanine N2 (7, 10-16), as well as adenine N6 exocyclic amino groups (17-19). As with many PAH diol epoxides, the guanine N2 adducts are of greater abundance than the corresponding adenine N6 adducts (20, 21). The development of efficient routes to the site-specific synthesis of PAH-modified oligodeoxynucleotides (22-27) facilitated structural studies of a number of guanine N2 PAH adducts (for a review, see ref 28). Most of this work involved diastereomeric adducts arising from the anti-benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxides (29-35). The first high-resolution PAHoligodeoxynucleotide structures were obtained for the (+)trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG and (-)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adducts (29, 30). These had the ligand oriented in the minor groove, with the stereochemistry of the benzylic carbon

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 8, 2003 2329 the modified guanine. This is similar to the (+)-trans-anti[BP]-N2-dG adduct having the corresponding stereochemistry (29, 30). It differs from the (-)-trans-anti-[BcPh]-N2dG adduct having the corresponding stereochemistry (1S at the benzylic carbon) which intercalates (37). The results address the role of the PAH molecular topology in determining the adduct structure at guanine N2, and may have implications with regard to the biological processing of these lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials. The oligodeoxynucleotide 5-d(GGCAGXTGGTG)-3 (Chart 1) was synthesized by reacting the (()aminotriol derived from (()-4 ,3R-dihydroxy-2R,1R-epoxy1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracene [(()-DE2] with an oligodeoxynucleotide containing 2-triflate O6-paranitrophenethyl deoxyinosine at position X6 (26, 44). The oligodeoxynucleotide 5-d(CACCACCTGCC)-3 was purchased from the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). The BA SRSR (12,2) oligodeoxynucleotide was purified from the reaction mixture by HPLC using a phenyl-hexyl semipreparative column (25 cm × 4.7 cm, Phenomenex) equilibrated with 10 mM triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0). The oligodeoxynucleotide was eluted with a methanol gradient (0 to 30% methanol over the course of 8 min, 31.6% methanol for 34 min, and 90% methanol for 2 min). The diastereomer that eluted at 37 min was identified as the BA SRSR (12,2) adduct by circular dichroism, enzymatic digestion, and mass spectrometry. The BA SRSR (12,2) oligodeoxynucleotide was lyophilized and desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (70 cm × 1.5 cm) (Amersham-Pharmacia, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The modified and complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were annealed at a 1:1.2 modified strand:complementary strand molar ratio in a buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0). The mixture was heated to 90 °C for 3 min and cooled to room temperature. The duplex was eluted from DNA grade BioGel hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) (15 cm × 3.0 cm) with a sodium phosphate gradient (from 10 to 200 mM over the course of 90 min; pH 7.0). The duplex was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (70 cm × 1.5 cm). It was lyophilized and resuspended in 0.25 mL of NMR buffer [0.1 M NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, and 50 µM Na2EDTA (pH 7.0)]. The sample used for examining nonexchangeable protons was dissolved in 99.996% D2O. The sample used for the examination of the exchangeable protons was dissolved in a 9:1 H2O/D2O mixture. In both instances, the duplex concentration was 1.7 mM. NMR. Experiments were performed at 1H frequencies of 600.13 and 800.23 MHz. The watergate pulse sequence suppressed the water signal (45-47). The spectra were recorded at 5 and 25 °C with a mixing time of 250 ms. The phase-sensitive NOESY spectra used for the assignment of nonexchangeable proton resonances were recorded at 25 °C with a mixing time of 200 ms using TPPI phase cycling, with a 2 s relaxation delay. Data were recorded with 2048 real points in the d1 dimension and 1024 real points in the d2 dimension. The data in the d1 dimension were zero-filled to give a matrix of 2K × 2K real points. A skewed sinebellsquare apodization function with a 70° phase shift was used

determining its orientation. The (+)-trans-anti diastereomer was oriented in the 5-direction, whereas the (-)-trans-anti diastereomer was oriented in the 3-direction (30). These two diastereomers had 10S and 10R designations at benzylic C10, respectively. Of other guanine N2 trans-anti PAH adducts, the 5-methylchrysene (-)-trans-anti-[5MC]-N2-dG diastereomer oriented in the 3-direction in the minor groove (36). This adduct had the 4R designation at the benzylic carbon. The (+)-trans-anti-[5MC]-N2-dG adduct (4S designation at the benzylic carbon) was disordered, precluding structural elucidation (28). The benzo[c]phenanthrene (-)-trans-anti[BcPh]-N2-dG adduct having S stereochemistry at the benzylic position intercalated in the 5-direction (37). PAH anti-diol epoxides can also open with cis stereochemistry at the site of adduction. The (+)-cis-anti-[BP]-N2-dG and (-)cis-anti-[BP]-dG diastereomers exhibited base-displaced intercalation, with the BP moiety centered between the two flanking base pairs. The displacement of the modified deoxyguanosine toward the minor or major groove was determined by the stereochemistry at benzylic C10 (31, 38). The oligodeoxynucleotide 5-d(GGCAGGTGGTG)-3,5d(CACCACCTGCC)-3, containing the codon 12 sequence (underlined) of the human N-ras protooncogene (39), was of interest because mutations in codon 12 are frequently found in tumor cells (40). Also, the anti isomers of BP diol epoxides are mutagenic in codons 12 and 61 of the human c-Ha-ras1 protooncogene (41). Previously, this oligodeoxynucleotide was used to examine the styrene oxide R- and S-[SO]-N2-dG adducts. As observed for the trans-anti[PAH]-N2-dG adducts, the R-[SO]-N2-dG adduct was oriented in the 3-direction, while the S-[SO]-N2-dG adduct was oriented in the 5-direction (42, 43). The work presented here describes the solution structure of the (1S,2R,3S,4R)-N2-[1-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenz[a]anthracenyl)]-2-deoxyguanosyl adduct incorporated into 5-d(GGCAGXTGGTG)-3,5-d(CACCACCTGCC)-3, where X is the adducted guanine located at position 2 of codon 12. This is named the BA SRSR (12,2) adduct (Chart 1) (26). Structural refinement demonstrates that the anthracenyl moiety orients in the minor groove in the 5-direction from

2330 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 8, 2003 in both dimensions. TOCSY spectra with a 10 kHz spinlock field were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms using the MLEV17 (48-50) sequence. Data were transferred to Octane workstations (Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and processed using FELIX (version 97.0, Accelrys, Inc., San Diego, CA). Distance Restraints. NOESY spectra were acquired at mixing times of 100, 150, and 200 ms. Footprints were drawn around cross-peaks for the spectrum measured with a mixing time of 200 ms. Cross-peak intensities were determined by volume integration. The same set of footprints was applied to spectra measured at other mixing times. The intensities were combined as necessary with intensities generated from complete relaxation matrix analysis of model B-form (IniB) and A-form (IniA) structures (51) to generate hybrid intensity matrices (52), from which distances were calculated using MARDIGRAS (version 3.0) (53, 54). The molecular motion was assumed to be isotropic. Trial calculations were run using correlation times of 2, 3, and 4 ns. The noise in peak volumes was set at an absolute value of one-half the volume of the smallest peak measured in each spectrum. The algorithm RANDMARDI (55) generated error bounds in calculated distances consistent with the experimental noise level in the spectra and the relative error assessed in volume measurements. RANDMARDI carried out 50 calculations of each set of spectral data, randomizing the value of each measured volume within the limits specified by the input noise level and the relative volume errors at each iteration. This yielded three sets of calculated distances from each NOESY experiment, which were averaged. The standard deviation in each distance was used as the upper and lower distance bound in subsequent calculations. The distance restraints for subsequent rMD and PEM calculations were divided into five classes on the basis of confidence (56). Deoxyribose pseudorotation restraints were determined from DQF-COSY data using sums of 3J 1H coupling constants (57). These were fit to curves relating coupling constants to pseudorotation, sugar pucker amplitude, and the percentage of S-type sugar conformation. Heteronuclear 1H31P correlation spectra (58) using selective IBURP-shaped pulses (59) were used to obtain 31P-H3 couplings. Dihedral restraints for the and sugar-phosphate backbone angles were derived from the 31P-1H 3J data (58). The Karplus relationship was used to determine the phosphodiester torsion angle (C4-C3-O3-P) (60), related to the H3-C3O3-31P torsion angle by a 120° shift. The phosphodiester torsion angle (C3-O3-P-O5) was calculated from the correlation between and in B-DNA (61). Restrained Molecular Dynamics. Restrained molecular dynamics (rMD) calculations and potential energy minimization (PEM) calculations were carried out using X-PLOR (62) (version 3.85). The partial charges assigned to the BA moiety are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. The CHARMM force field (63, 64) contributed the terms for bonds, bond angles, torsion angles, tetrahedral and planar geometry, hydrogen bonding, and nonbonding interactions, including van der Waals and electrostatic forces for the empirical portion of the energy function (65). The electrostatic term used the Coulomb function based on a reduced charge set of partial charges and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4.0, to mimic solvent screening of charge. The van der Waals term was approximated using

Kim et al. the Lennard-Jones potential energy function. The effective energy function was comprised of two terms describing distance and dihedral restraints, both of which were in the form of standard square well potentials (66, 67). Bond lengths involving hydrogens were fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (68) during calculations. The nonbonded pair list was updated if any atom moved more than 0.5 Å. The cutoff radius for nonbonded interactions was 11 Å. Calculations were run in vacuo, without explicit counterions. Calculations were initiated by coupling the system to a heating bath with a target temperature of 1000 K. Force constants of 10 kcal mol-1 Å-2 were used for empirical hydrogen bonding, 20 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for torsion angle restraints, and 50, 45, 40, 35, and 30 kcal mol-1 Å-2 for the five classes of NOE restraints. The target temperature was reached in 5 ps and was maintained for 15 ps. The molecules were cooled to 300 K over 5 ps and maintained at that temperature for 15 ps of equilibrium dynamics. The force constants for the five classes of NOE restraints were scaled up for 3.5 ps during the heating period to 150, 130, 100, 100, and 100 kcal mol-1 Å-2 in the order of confidence factor. These weights were maintained during the reminder of the heating period and for the first 5 ps of the equilibrium dynamics period. They were then scaled down to 50, 45, 40, 35, and 30 kcal mol-1 Å-2 in the order of confidence factor. The torsion angle and base pair distance force constants were scaled up to 100 kcal mol-1 Å-2 during the same period as for the NOE restraints. They were scaled back to 20 and 10 kcal mol-1 Å-2, also at the same time as the NOE restraints. Coordinate sets were archived every 0.1 ps, and 49 structures from the last 10 ps were averaged. These average rMD structures were subjected to conjugate gradient energy minimization, for 1100 iterations, to obtain the final structures. Final structures were analyzed using X-PLOR to measure the rmsd between an average structure and the converged structures. Back calculation of theoretical NMR intensities from the emergent structures was performed using CORMA (version 4.0) (52). Helicoidal analysis of the structures was accomplished using 3DNA (http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/ xiangjun/3DNA/) (69). RESULTS

Resonance Assignments

Nonexchangeable Protons. An expanded NOE spectrum showing the pattern of sequential connectivity between the aromatic and anomeric protons is displayed in Figure 1. The sequential assignments for both strands of the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex were obtained without interruptions (70, 71). The notable features observed in this region of the spectrum for the modified strand were downfield chemical shifts for X6 H8 and X6 H1, relative to those of the unmodified oligomer (39). In the complementary strand, upfield chemical shifts were observed for C18 H1 and T19 H1 sugar protons. The C18 H1 resonance was observed at  4.23 ppm, and the T19 H1 resonance was observed at  4.68 ppm. These upfield shifts were compared with similar upfield shifts for the C18 H2 and H2 and T19 H2 and H2 protons, the assignments for which were obtained from a combination of TOCSY, DQF-COSY, and eCOSY (72) spectra. For C18, H2 was observed at  1.29 ppm and H2

was observed at  1.42 ppm. Likewise, for T19, H2 was observed at  1.88 ppm and H2 was observed at  2.24 ppm. The pattern of upfield chemical shifts was also observed for C18 H3, observed at  4.08 ppm, and T19 H4, observed at  4.2 ppm. The deoxyribose H5 and H5 protons were assigned, to the extent possible, on the basis of the expectation that the H5 resonance was downfield of the H5 resonance. The chemical shifts of the nonexchangeable protons are listed in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Exchangeable Protons. An expanded region showing cross-peaks between the imino protons is given in Figure 2. Assignment of the imino protons was made from NOE connectivities between adjacent base pairs and connectivities to the base-paired amino protons (73). Sequential assignments of the imino protons from base pairs G2,C21 f T10,A13 were obtained unequivocally. The imino proton resonance from the 5-neighbor G5 N1H proton was broadened, suggesting an increased rate of exchange with solvent. The imino resonance arising from the modified nucleotide X6 N1H proton was observed at  12.4 ppm. It showed the expected NOEs to T7 N3H and A16 H2 from the 3-neighbor T7,A16 base pair. It showed a weak NOE in the 5-direction, to G5 N1H of the 5-neighbor G5,C18 base pair. With the exception of the 5-terminal nucleotides G1 and 12 C , distinctive amino protons were observed for each cytosine (Figure 2). The non-hydrogen-bonded amino protons of cytosine were assigned from their cross-peaks to the resonances of the hydrogen-bonded amino protons. The amino proton resonances of nucleotide C18, belonging to the 5-neighbor G5,C18 base pair, were broadened compared to

the resonances of the other cytosine amino protons. It was not possible to assign the X6 amino proton. The chemical shifts of the exchangeable protons are listed in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. Benz[a]anthracene Protons. An expanded region of the NOESY spectrum used for the assignment of BA aromatic protons is shown in Figure 3. Fifteen BA-BA NOEs were used to assign the aromatic protons of benz[a]anthracene, in combination with DQF-COSY and TOCSY data. A DQFCOSY spectrum revealed three cross-peaks, corresponding to 3J 1H couplings between BA H5 and H6, BA H8 and H9, and BA H10 and H11 protons. The BA H12 resonance was identified by the BA H11-BA H12 NOE. Likewise, the BA H7 resonance showed both BA H7-BA H6 and BA H7BA H8 NOEs. The BA aromatic proton assignments were verified by a TOCSY experiment. The aliphatic protons of the BA cyclohexene ring were identified from COSY and NOESY data. These resonances were found in the 4-5 ppm spectral region. The chemical shifts of the BA resonances are listed in Table S3 of the Supporting Information. Benz[a]anthracene-DNA NOEs. NOEs between protons of the BA moiety and the DNA involved deoxyribose protons of nucleotides X6 and T7 in the modified strand and nucleotides C18 and T19 in the complementary strand (Figure 4 and Figure S2 of the Supporting Information). Several of the deoxyribose proton resonances overlapped in the spectrum, but nine NOEs could be uniquely identified. BA H2 exhibited an NOE to T7 H1, as did BA H3. These protons were located on the cyclohexenyl ring of BA. Of the aromatic BA protons, BA H6 exhibited an NOE to T19 H5. BA H7 exhibited an NOE to T19 H5 and BA H9 an NOE to T19 H4. BA H10 exhibited a weak NOE to T19 H4. BA H11 also had an NOE to X6 H1, and an NOE to T19 H4. BA H12 exhibited an NOE to X6 H1. Several additional BADNA NOEs were not uniquely assigned due to spectral overlap. BA H5 and H6 exhibited NOEs to an overlapped set of three resonances assigned as C18 H4, H5, and H5. BA H6, BA H7, and BA H8 each exhibited NOEs to an

overlapped set of two resonances assigned as T19 H4 and H5. Torsion Angle Analysis. Evaluation of the DQF-COSY data suggested that the pseudorotation for C17 was shifted into the C1-exo range. It was not possible to extract J coupling data for C18 and T19 due to spectral overlap which occurred as a consequence of the upfield chemical shifts of the H1, H2, and H2 resonances from these nucleotides. With the exception of C18 and T19, the remainder of the nucleotides favored the C2-endo sugar ring conformation. It was not possible to determine 1H J couplings associated

with the cyclohexene ring of the BA moiety due to line broadening. Measurements for the phosphodiester backbone torsion angles and were obtained from a heteronuclear 1 H-31P correlation experiment. The 31P chemical shifts were observed in the expected chemical shift range. With the exception of nucleotides C18 and T19, for which data were not obtained, the 3J 1H-31P couplings for and were in the expected range for B-DNA. Chemical Shift Perturbations. The chemical shifts of the nonexchangeable and exchangeable protons, compared to those of the unmodified ras12 sequence, are shown in Figure 5. These perturbations were localized near the site of adduction. They involved base pairs located in the 5direction from X6. Upfield chemical shifts of 0.25 ppm for C18 H6 and 0.2 ppm for T19 H6 were observed. A downfield chemical shift of 0.4 ppm was observed for X6 H8. Significant changes in chemical shift were observed for sugar protons proximate to the adducted nucleotide X6. A 0.6 ppm downfield shift was detected for X6 H1. The sugar protons X6 H2 and H2 experienced downfield shifts of 0.2 ppm. In the complementary strand, C18 H1 shifted 1.6 ppm upfield.

C18 H2 and H2 shifted 0.75 ppm upfield. Likewise, C18 H3 shifted 0.7 ppm upfield. T19 H1 shifted 1.1 ppm upfield, and T19 H2 and H2 shifted 0.25 ppm upfield. T19 H3 exhibited a 0.25 ppm upfield shift. The upfield shifts for T19 deoxyribose protons were significant because the A4, T19 base pair was two bases to the 5-direction from the site of adduction. Restrained Molecular Dynamics Calculations A total of 426 experimental distance restraints were used. These included nine BA-DNA distances that were determined from uniquely assigned BA-DNA NOEs. The DNA distance restraints were approximately evenly distributed along the length of the duplex. A list of the experimental distance restraints along with the upper and lower bounds is shown in Table S4 of the Supporting Information. The torsion angle restraints included 90 sugar pucker restraints. Also, 40 experimentally determined phosphodiester backbone angle restraints were included. These angles were restrained to 165 ( 30° and -105 ( 25°, the exceptions being C18 and T19, for which torsion angle restraints were not obtained. The conformation of the BA cyclohexene ring was not defined by torsion angle restraints in the rMD calculations, since it was not possible to extract J couplings for these resonances. Empirical base pair planarity restraints were used, except at the modified X6,C17 base pair and at adjacent A4,T19, G5, C18, and T7,A16 base pairs. The rationale for inclusion of the planarity restraints was 2-fold (Figure 2). First, a complete set of NOEs was observed between the imino and amino protons of G,C base pairs, and between the imino and H2 protons of A,T base pairs. Second, a complete set of NOEs was observed between imino protons found in adjacent base pairs along the duplex.

Randomly seeded rMD calculations were initiated from both A-form (IniA) and B-form (IniB) starting structures (Figure 6). The maximum pairwise rmsd for the emergent structures arising from either the IniA or IniB starting structure was 0.5 Å. This suggested that the ensemble of structures emerging from the rMD calculations were reasonably converged. The calculated rmsd between the average structure emergent from the rMD calculations and the A-form starting structure was 3.5 Å. The calculated rmsd between the average structure emergent from the rMD calculations and the B-form starting structure was 2.7 Å. The calculated rmsd between the averaged structures initiated from either the B-form or A-form starting structures was 1.40 Å. The structures emergent from the rMD calculations differed from both the A-form and B-form starting structures. However, they more closely approximated B-form DNA. The total energies and NOE restraint violation energies for converged structures were lower than 3 and 0.04 kcal/mol, respectively. None of the reported NOE violations involved NOEs between BA and DNA. The accuracy of the calculated structures was judged by complete relaxation matrix analysis using CORMA (52). The overall sixth-root residual R1x, calculated between the theoretical NOE intensities predicted by the refined structure and the actual NOE intensities, was 8.5 × 10-2 (Table 1). Figure 7 shows the distribution of R1x values for intranucleotide and internucleotide NOEs, for each base pair in the oligodeoxynucleotide duplex. The residuals were consistently on the order of 10% in both strands of the duplex. The CORMA calculations suggested reasonable agreement between the refined structure and the NOE data. Accuracy was also judged by comparing the distance restraints between BA protons and DNA protons predicted by MARDIGRAS,

Structure of the Adduct The structure that emerged from the rMD calculations was a right-handed duplex, in which the BA moiety was in the

Minor Groove Guanine-N2-Benz[a]anthracene Adduct

Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 8, 2003 2335 complementary strand (Figure 5). Also, the pattern of NOEs observed between the BA protons and the DNA extended in the 5-direction from the adducted site, also primarily involving the adducted X6,C17 base pair, and nucleotides C18 and T19 in the complementary strand. There was no interruption in sequential NOE connectivities between base and deoxyribose H1 resonances, either for the aromatic and anomeric region or for the imino regions of the spectra. Watson-Crick type hydrogen bonding was maintained at the X6,C17 base pair, as evidenced by observation of the N1 imino proton resonance and NOEs between the imino resonance and the amino protons of nucleotide C17 (Figure 2). The predicted orientation of the BA aromatic protons H5-H9 toward the unmodified strand was consistent with NOEs observed to deoxyribose protons of C18 and T19 (Figure 4). Although the BA moiety extended in the 5-direction toward the A4,T19 base pair, the rMD calculations predicted that the BA H9 and H10 protons were not within 5 Å of the minor groove A4 H2 proton. This was consistent with the failure to observe NOEs between BA H9 and H10 and A4 H2. The NOEs between BA H1, H11, and H12 and X6 H1 were explained by the predicted location of these protons facing X6. The line broadening of the Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonded imino resonance and the C18 NH2 resonances at the G5,C18 base pair suggested a thermal destabilization of this base pair, accompanied by an increased level of proton exchange, in the presence of the BA lesion. Molecular Topology. In Chart 2, the topology of the BA SRSR (12,2) adduct is compared with that of the corresponding BP, 5MC, and BcPh adducts having comparable stereochemistry. The (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct oriented in the minor groove in the 5-direction (29, 30) in a manner similar to that of the presently examined BA SRSR (12,2) adduct. However, the BA ring system extended further in the 5-direction in the groove than did the BP ring system (29, 30). The rMD calculations suggested that the BA moiety extended in the 5-direction toward the A4,T19 base pair, two base pairs in the 5-direction from X6 (Figure 8). The topology of the BA aromatic rings as compared to the BP aromatic rings suggested that BA, when embedded in the minor groove, was more shielded from solvent than was BP. In contrast to BA and BP, the (-)-trans-anti-[BcPh]-N2dG adduct, which possessed the fjord region ring, intercalated in the 5-direction at the adducted site (37). The (+)-transanti-[5MC]-N2-dG adduct with the corresponding stereochemistry (4S at the benzylic carbon) was disordered and did not yield a refined solution structure (28). It provided an interesting contrast in that the methyl group was at the fjord position. Its topology may simultaneously hinder minor groove binding, as observed for the (+)-trans-anti-[BP]N2-dG (29, 30) and trans-anti-[BA]-N2-dG adducts, and intercalation, as observed for the (-)-trans-anti-[BcPh]-N2dG adduct (37). PAH topology modulates conformation differently for adducts at guanine N2 versus adducts at adenine N6. Both the trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG and trans-anti-[BA]-N2-dG adducts exhibited minor groove binding, oriented in the 5direction. This was not the case for the corresponding adenine N6 adducts of these two PAH lesions. When adducted to adenine N6, both exhibited multiple conformations in duplex DNA, indicating some degree of structural disorder at the lesion sites. Two conformations in slow exchange on the

minor groove, shown in Figure 8. It was oriented in the 5direction from nucleotide X6. The BA moiety extended almost two base pairs in the 5-direction toward the A4,T19 base pair. Accommodation of the BA aromatic rings in the minor groove allowed for maintenance of Watson-Crick type base pairing adjacent to the lesion site. Helicoidal analysis suggested the width of the minor groove at the site of adduction, and extending in the 5-direction, was 13 ( 0.5 Å. The values for helical twist and base pair rise at the adducted site remained within the range anticipated for a B-like duplex, consistent with the conclusion that the BA moiety was accommodated within the minor groove. The calculations predicted that the BA aromatic rings were proximate to deoxyribose sugars at nucleotides C17, C18, and T19 in the complementary strand. The BA moiety was oriented such that BA protons H5-H8 faced toward the complementary strand. Protons H9 and H10 faced in the 5direction toward the A4,T19 base pair. The calculations predicted that these protons should show NOEs to deoxyribose protons of T19, but not to the minor groove proton A4 H2. Protons H11 and H12 were in the minor groove and faced the modified strand of the duplex. DISCUSSION The site-specific adduction of DNA by stereoisomeric PAH diol epoxides is generally believed to represent the means by which chemicals in this class of mutagens initiate their genotoxic effects. Adducts at guanine N2 generally represent the predominant chemically stable adducts for PAH diol epoxides. Consequently, considerable effort has been spent to elucidate solution structures of the stereoisomeric bay region PAH-N2-dG adducts (28, 37). In general, the conformations of guanine N2 adducts of bay region PAH depend on the stereochemistry of the cyclohexene ring, particularly at the benzylic carbon, and also on DNA sequence (28). Structure of the BA SRSR (12,2) Adduct. Several lines of evidence supported the conclusion that the BA aligned in the minor groove in the 5-direction with respect to the modified nucleotide X6, as predicted by the rMD calculations. These included the pattern of chemical shift perturbations which involved the X6,C17 lesion site, and extended in the 5-direction, involving nucleotides C18 and T19 in the

NMR time scale existed for the trans-anti-[BA]-N6-dA adduct. In the major conformation, an anti glycosidic torsion angle was observed for the adducted dA. The refined structure was a right-handed duplex, with the BA moiety intercalated on the 3-face of the modified base pair, from the major groove (74). Multiple conformations also existed for the corresponding trans-anti-[BP]-N6-dA adduct. In the major conformation, the modified dA was rotated about the glycosyl bond into the syn conformation, to enable 3intercalation of the aromatic ring system moiety (75). Thus, the topology that facilitated minor groove binding at guanine N2 resulted in 3-intercalation accompanied by structural disorder at adenine N6. Yet another pattern emerged with benzo[c]phenanthrene adducts having S stereochemistry at the benzylic carbon. These intercalated when adducted to either guanine N2 (37) or adenine N6 (76, 77). Overall, the various results suggest that a complex interplay between multiple factors, including stereochemistry and sequence, in combination with topology, modulates PAH adduct structure in duplex DNA. Biological Implications. The conformational diversity of PAH adducts in DNA is anticipated to play a role in their subsequent biological processing (78). Excision of sitespecific trans-anti-[PAH]-N2-dG adducts by the human nucleotide excision repair system correlated with minor groove conformations versus intercalative conformations (79, 80). Lin et al. (37) argued that the molecular topology of PAH adducts modulated repair. The minor groove (+)-transanti-[BP]-N2-dG lesion was a better substrate for nucleotide excision repair than was the intercalated (-)-trans-anti[BcPh]-N2-dG lesion. It was proposed that intercalated fjord region PAH adducts were less efficiently recognized by the nucleotide excision repair apparatus than the minor groovebound nonfjord region PAH (81). Our results suggest the trans-anti-[BA]-N2-dG adduct in duplex DNA more closely resembles the (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct and not the

(-)-trans-anti-[BcPh]-N2-dG adduct. It will be of interest to determine if this structural correlation with the (+)-transanti-[BP]-N2-dG adduct is reflected in the recognition of the trans-anti-[BA]-N2-dG adduct by the nucleotide excision repair apparatus. DNA Sequence Considerations. These studies were conducted at 25 °C. A single set of resonances was observed in the 1H spectrum, consistent with a single conformation of the BA SRSR (12,2) adduct. At 5 °C, additional 1H resonances were observed. These were not assigned. However, they were consistent with the spectral line broadening for the G5,C18 base pair observed at 25 °C, and suggested formation of a less stable minor conformation of the BA SRSR (12,2) adduct at lower temperatures. This was consistent with observations that T,A base pairs flanking guanine N2 PAH lesions induced greater disorder to duplex DNA. For example, when the (+)-trans-anti-[BP]-N2-dG lesion was placed into the 5-TXC-3 sequence, Fountain and Krugh (35) reported exchange broadening in the 1H spectrum, suggesting the presence of a second minor conformation.
