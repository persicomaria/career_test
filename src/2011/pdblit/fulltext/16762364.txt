Abstract The identification of phosphorylation sites in proteins provides a powerful tool to study signal transduction pathways and to establish interaction networks involving signaling elements. Using different strategies to identify phosphorylated residues, we report here mass spectrometry studies of the entire intracellular regions of four ‘receptor-like’ protein kinases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PknB, PknD, PknE, and PknF), each consisting of an N-terminal kinase domain and a juxtamembrane region of varying length (26≠100 residues). The enzymes were observed to incorporate different numbers of phosphates, from five in PknB up to 11 in PknD or PknE, and all detected sites were dephosphorylated by the cognate mycobacterial phosphatase PstP. Comparison of the phosphorylation patterns reveals two recurrent clusters of pThr/pSer residues, respectively, in their activation loops and juxtamembrane regions, which have a distinct effect on kinase activity. All studied kinases have at least two conserved phosphorylated residues in their activation loop and mutations of these residues in PknB significantly decreased the kinase activity, whereas deletion of the entire juxtamembrane regions in PknB and PknF had little effect on their activities. These results reinforce the hypothesis that mycobacterial kinase regulation includes a conserved activation loop mechanism, and suggest that phosphorylation sites in the juxtamembrane region might be involved in putative kinase-mediated signaling cascades. ” 2005 Elsevier Inc.

lation also takes place in prokaryotes [2], in parallel to (and possibly interacting with) the prevailing two-component His phosphorylation systems [3]. It is now known that these ‘eukaryotic-like’ signaling systems, relying on Ser/Thr- or Tyr-protein kinases, are directly involved in bacterial processes such as developmental regulation, control of cell growth, stress responses, regulation of secondary metabolite production, infectivity, and survival in host cells [4≠8]. One relevant example is the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

whose genome includes genes encoding as many as 11 functional Ser/Thr protein kinases (compared to a similar number of functional two-component systems), one protein Ser/Thr phosphatase (PstP), and two protein Tyr phosphatases [9]. Most of these enzymes have already been produced as recombinant proteins and found to have biochemical properties similar to their eukaryotic homologues, including autophosphorylation as a presumptive mechanism of activity modulation [10≠18]. Ser/Thr protein kinases catalyze protein phosphorylation by transferring a phosphate group from the c-position of ATP to the side-chain hydroxyl group of Ser or Thr residues in protein substrates. While these enzymes share a well-conserved catalytic scaffold and active site machinery, extensive studies of eukaryotic enzymes stressed the remarkable conformational plasticity of the kinase domain, which gives rise to quite different mechanisms of activity regulation in response to autophosphorylation and/or interactions with specific regulatory domains [19,20]. However, except for the catalytic domain of PknB, whose activity was shown to be regulated by phosphorylation in the activation loop [14,15], no information is currently available on the autophosphorylation pattern and possible regulation mechanisms of mycobacterial kinases. In the present work, we combined matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) with reverse-phase HPLC separations, enzymatic treatments, and specific chemical modifications to identify the autophosphorylation sites in the entire intracellular regions of four receptor-like Ser/Thr protein kinases from M. tuberculosis. The emerging pattern of phosphorylation and the biochemical and biological implications of protein kinase autophosphorylation are discussed; data supporting a

Cloning and mutagenesis. Subcloning of the intracellular region of PknB (residues 1≠331) was carried out as described [14] and the same strategy was used for the three other Ser/Thr kinases used in this work. The cosmid MTCY10H4, including the genes pknD, pknE, and pknF, was used as PCR template in subcloning experiments. PCR fragments encoding the putative cytoplasmic regions of PknD (residues 1≠378), PknE (residues 1≠336), and PknF (residues 1≠306) were amplified using forward primers including a NdeI site and reverse primers containing a stop codon and a HindIII site (Table 1). The digested and purified PCR products were ligated into the pET-28a expression vector using the engineered NdeI and HindIII sites. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. In order to express the catalytic domains only of the above kinases, a stop codon was introduced in each construct by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stop codons were introduced in the coding sequences in positions corresponding to the following amino acid residues: 280 (PknB), 279 (PknD), 278 (PknE), and 281 (PknF). The construct expressing the single PknB mutant Lys40Ala was also obtained by site-directed mutagenesis from the plasmid with the wild-type pknB gene. The sequences of all the mutagenic primers are listed in Table 1. Protein expression and purification. Protein expression and purification was performed as described before for PknB [14]. Briefly, Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain transformed with the appropriate plasmid was grown at 37 ∞C until late log phase in Luria≠Bertani (LB) medium with 50 lg/ml kanamycin. Induction of expression was conducted for 12≠16 h at 15 ∞C, after addition of 1 mM isopropyl-bthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Bacterial pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 M NaCl, in the presence of protease inhibitors, and sonicated. The recombinant proteins were purified from the supernatant by immobilized Ni-affinity chromatography followed by a gel filtration step (Hi-Trap Sepharose and Superdex 75 columns, Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were subsequently concentrated and purity of the samples was checked by

SDS≠PAGE. Except for the constructions PknE1≠277 and PknD1≠ 278, all other proteins were produced in soluble and active form. Protein kinase assays. Measurements of protein kinase activity were carried out in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.01% Brij35, 5% glycerol, 50 lM ATP, and 0.05 lCi/ll of [c-33P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Myelin-basic protein (MBP) was used as substrate at a concentration of 10 lM, with kinase≠substrate ratios of 1:10 or 1:20, for variable times at 30 ∞C. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS≠PAGE loading buffer supplemented with 5 mM EDTA (final concentration) and incubating the samples at 95 ∞C for 5 min. The reaction mixtures were resolved by 12% SDS≠PAGE; gels were Coomassie-stained, dried, and analyzed with a Storm860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). MBP phosphorylation was also followed measuring changes in molecular mass after incubation with different kinases. In some experiments, increased sensitivity was achieved by monitoring phosphorylation of MBP at peptide 30≠41 by MS measurements after tryptic digestion. Protein dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylation assays were carried out by incubation of recombinant protein kinases (5≠20 lM) with purified PstP (phosphatase≠substrate ratios 1:5 to 1:10) in 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mM DTT, 2 mM MnCl2 for 1 h at 35 ∞C. In some experiments, alkaline phosphatase from calf intestine (Roche Diagnostics) was used for enzymatic dephosphorylation, following instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Sample preparation for mass spectrometry. Proteolytic digestions were carried out by incubating recombinant proteins with trypsin (Promega) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, overnight at 35 ∞C (enzyme≠substrate ratios 1:10 to 1:50). HPLC separations were performed on a reverse-phase column (Vydac C18, 150 ∑ 2.1 mm) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile from 0% to 50% in 100 min. Eluate was monitored at 220 nm and fractions were manually collected for mass spectrometry analysis. The b-elimination reactions at phosphoresidues were performed by treatment of 0.2≠1 lg of peptide with saturated solution of Ba(OH)2 at room temperature for 12 h as previously reported [21]. Samples were then acidified with acetic acid and desalted using a home-made micro-column filled with POROS-R2 50 lm chromatography media (Applied Biosystem) prior to MS analysis. Carboxylates were modified following published procedures [22]. In brief, digestion mixtures (obtained from approximately 2 lg of protein) were lyophilized, resuspended in 50 ll of 2 M methanolic HCl, and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Solvent was removed by lyophilization. The sample was resuspended in 0.01% acetic acid and phosphopeptides were isolated from peptide mixtures using IMAC Sepharose gel with chelated Fe3+. After equilibration and extensive washing with 0.01% acetic acid, retained peptides were eluted from the gel containing 50 mM Na2HPO4, pH 9, and desalted with a POROSR2 micro-column as described above prior to MS analysis. Alternatively, elution was performed with 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile≠H2O (50%, v/v). Mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry measurements were carried out in a Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF system (Applied Biosystems) equipped with a N2 laser source (337 nm). Molecular mass of recombinant Ser/Thr protein kinases was determined before and after treatment with PstP using sinapinic acid as matrix (10 mg/ml in acetonitrile≠H2O 50%, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid) and enolase from Baker’s yeast as external standard. Protein samples (1≠3 lg) were desalted by incubation in batch with POROS-R2 media and followed by extensive washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. POROS beads were mixed with matrix solution and directly applied onto the MALDI-TOF sample plate. Mass spectra of digestion mixtures or isolated peptides were acquired on linear and reflector modes using a matrix solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile≠H2O (50%, v/v) and were externally calibrated using a mixture of peptide standards (Applied Biosystem).

Results and discussion Recombinant protein kinases are phosphorylated active enzymes The whole intracellular regions of four membranebound Ser/Thr protein kinases from M. tuberculosis, namely PknB, PknD, PknE, and PknF, were produced as recombinant proteins in E. coli. All the enzymes show autophosphorylation activity and can use MBP as a surrogate substrate (Fig. 1A). Each kinase can phosphorylate MBP in multiple sites, as mass spectrometry analysis revealed the incorporation of five to nine

phosphates depending on the protein kinase used. A particular site (Thr 33) was found to be systematically and strongly phosphorylated by all enzymes (Fig. 1B), and thus its detection by mass spectrometry was used as a sensitive marker to confirm kinase activity. The overall phosphorylation state of the recombinant protein kinases was tested by MALDI-TOF mass measurements of whole molecules before and after incubation with the protein phosphatase PstP. This approach confirmed the phosphorylated state of all the enzymes under investigation. The most abundant molecular species for each protein kinase contains five (PknB), nine (PknF) or 11 (PknD, PknE) phosphorylated residues (data not shown). The phosphorylation pattern was more homogeneous for PknB, as three amino acid positions appeared fully phosphorylated in all samples studied, corresponding to Thr171 and Thr173 in the activation loop (as previously shown [14]) and Thr294 in the juxtamembrane region. Traces of a third modified residue in the activation loop could only be detected in some preparations upon chemical treatment with Ba(OH)2 and PSD sequencing (see below). In contrast, phosphate incorporation was more heterogeneous for the other three enzymes, since multiple species with different degrees of phosphorylation were clearly present in all studied samples. Thus, the phosphorylation patterns of PknD, PknE, and PknF appear to be more complex than in the case of PknB, regarding both the degree and heterogeneity of the modification. Kinase phosphorylation results from autocatalytic activity The observed phosphorylation pattern in the four recombinant kinases can be assumed to be the consequence of an autocatalytic activity, since all proteins were expressed in E. coli, where no endogenous Ser/ Thr kinase activity has been reported. To confirm this hypothesis, we produced an inactive point mutant of the catalytic domain of PknB (which contains two phosphorylation sites in its activation loop) by mutating the essential catalytic residue Lys40 to Ala. As expected, this point mutant had no kinase activity on MBP and MS studies of the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli revealed that its activation loop was completely unphosphorylated (data not shown), demonstrating that the phosphorylation pattern observed in the wild-type proteins is the result of an autocatalytic process. Identification of phosphorylation sites Our first approach to localize phosphorylation sites included MS measurements, in linear and reflector modes, of tryptic digests before and after treatment with phosphatases (mycobacterial PstP or alkaline phosphatase). Results obtained from comparing spectra taken with both digests have a predictive value for the pres-

ence of pThr- and pSer-containing peptides, indicated by mass values shifting 80 Da or multiples thereof. A representative experiment is shown for PknD in Fig. 2A, where three different phosphopeptides could be identified. However, a full coverage of phosphorylation sites is quite difficult to achieve in this way, due to analytical problems associated with the detection of phosphopeptides. Mass spectrometric signals of phosphopeptides present in complex mixtures are usually low due to poor desorption/ionization properties of negatively charged species, the tendency to undergo fragmentation, and ion suppression effects induced by the presence of dominant unphosphorylated peptides. To circumvent these problems, a set of strategies was applied in order to attain the broadest coverage of phosphorylation sites for a given molecule, including phosphopeptide enrichment steps such as affinity chromatography or reversed-phase HPLC. For instance, after HPLC separation of tryptic PknD digest, phosphopeptide coverage can be significantly improved (Figs. 2B and C), allowing the identification of 13 phosphorylated peptides compared to only three in the non-fractionated tryptic mixture (Fig. 2A). Improvement in phosphosite coverage for the three other kinases was attained after similar phosphopeptide enrichment steps. Affinity methods for phosphopeptide isolation on immobilized Fe3+ ions bound to a chelating gel were found particularly useful for large multiphosphorylated species previously derivatized by methylation of carboxylate groups [22,23], as shown in Fig. 3. Such chemical modification increased IMAC selectivity for phosphopeptides while avoiding non-specific binding of negatively charged peptides. In particular, the diphosphorylated sequence 345≠377 from PknD (Table 2) could only be detected in this way. The phosphorylation state and the number of phosphate groups in each phosphopeptide was further confirmed by PSD MS experiments (Fig. 4). Generation of mass differences of 80 Da (loss of HPO3) or 98 Da (loss of H3PO4), or combinations thereof in multiple phosphorylated species (as shown in Fig. 4A), are strongly indicative of phosphorylation at serine or threonine residue(s) [24]. Further fragmentation and sequencing by PSD MS (Fig. 4B) was performed to identify the phosphorylation sites, which are reported in Table 2. Even if PSD MALDI-TOF MS is not generally considered the most appropriate MS-based technique to get sequence data from phosphopeptides, the above results point to its usefulness for a rapid identification of multiple phosphorylated peptides in complex mixtures. In addition, it is generally reliable for an unequivocal localization of the modified amino acids. In some cases, the fragmentation properties of phosphopeptides still preclude the detection of sequence-specific ion signals, thus rendering the localization of phosphorylated sites difficult. When that was found to

(A) Linear MALDI mass spectra of tryptic digests from recombinant PknD before (top) and after (bottom) treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Mass signals of phosphorylated peptides (indicated by arrows in top panel) were assigned as follows: m/z = 1849.80, monophosphorylated His-Tag peptide; m/z = 1929.57, diphosphorylated His-Tag peptide; m/z = 3051.55, monophosphorylated peptide 262≠289. After phosphatase treatment, these phosphorylated peptides were no longer detected (thin vertical arrows in bottom panel), while native peptide m/z signals either increased (m/z = 1768.82, His-Tag peptide) or became apparent (m/z = 2472.00, sequence 162≠185; m/z = 2971.34, sequence 262≠289; and m/z = 3119.63, sequence 345≠376) as indicated by thick arrows.

Phosphopeptides identified by PSD mass analyses are marked with an asterisk. (C) Location of phosphopeptides in the PknD sequence. Positions ¿19 to 1 correspond to the His-Tag peptide, positions 1≠377 correspond to the whole intracellular region of PknD and include the catalytic domain. Phosphopeptides identified from a mass spectrum obtained with a whole tryptic digestion mixture are shown by bars below the sequence. In this way, the protein sequence was covered by up to 48%, including 13% of total tryptic phosphopeptides. Phosphopeptides identified by mass analysis of HPLC fractions (as stated in (B)) are shown by blue bars above the sequence. With this approach, protein sequence was covered by 81% and 68% of total identified phosphopeptides could be directly detected.

In this experiment, peptide mixtures were incubated with IMAC-Sepharose gel with chelated Fe3+ ions before and after carboxylate modification with methanolic HCl. Retained peptides were eluted from the gel with phosphate buffer and desalted with a POROS-R2 micro-column prior to MS analysis. The chemical modification clearly increases the selectivity for phosphopeptides (indicated by arrows) by eliminating the binding of acidic peptides through their carboxylate groups. After derivatization, peptides usually appear as double signals with a 14 Da difference corresponding to partial methylation of C-terminal carboxylate groups. Each phosphorylation site was confirmed by PSD MS measurements.

Each peptide sequence was usually found with different degree of phosphorylation. These residues were identified by PSD sequencing. c Sequence 162≠189 appears mostly diphosphorylated at T171 and T173. Trace amounts of a triphosphorylated peptide includes pS166, identified by PSD sequencing after treatment with Ba(OH)2 as stated in the text. d In this case, a phosphorylated residue adjacent to R or K precludes tryptic cleavage, then this peptide is only detected when phosphorylated. e This peptide includes three amino acids from the His-Tag at the N terminus. f Phosphorylated residues in mono- and diphosphorylated peptides were not identified.

be the case, a pre-treatment of the phosphorylated peptides with Ba(OH)2 was included to generate the corresponding dehydroamino acid from pThr and pSer residues by b-elimination of H3PO4, thus rendering a more appropriate derivative for MS studies [21]. As an example, using the above approach S166 was identified to be a minor, third phosphorylated residue in the activation loop of PknB (Table 2). Data summarizing phosphosite mapping of the intracellular regions from the four mycobacterial Ser/Thr protein kinases are presented in Fig. 5 and Table 2. Total sequence coverage using the different approaches outlined above was 90% for PknB, 86% for PknD, 82% for PknE, and 84% for PknF. This extensive sequence coverage left aside only a small number of undetected peptides containing Ser or Thr residues

whose phosphorylation status could not be determined: PknB (Ser129), PknD (Thr98, Ser99, Ser218, and Ser235), PknE (Thr67, Ser148, Ser162, Thr164, Thr165, and Ser332), and PknF (Ser302 and Thr306). Since specific methods were used to enrich the peptide mixtures in phosphorylated species, it is unlikely that undetected peptides included pThr or pSer residues. The four protein kinases are substrates of the cognate mycobacterial phosphatase PstP Since M. tuberculosis contains only one gene, pstP, coding for a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, we wondered whether PstP was active on the different kinases, as might be expected if the kinase activity is dependent on (or regulated by) reversible phosphorylation

The occurrence of m/z signals corresponding to MH+-80 and MH+-98 strongly point to the presence of phosphate groups in serine or threonine residues. (B) The mass spectrum of tryptic peptide 287≠308 from the C-terminal region of PknB displays the fragmentation pattern characteristic of a monophosphorylated peptide. Mass differences between adjacent y ions establish the identity of each amino acid in the peptide sequence, while the series of y-98 signals allow identification of Thr294 as the phosphorylated residue.

Additional tryptic phosphopeptides for which the individual residues could not be unambiguously identified are indicated below the sequences, together with the maximum number of phosphate groups in each case (tryptic phosphopeptides including the His-Tag are not shown). Phospho-modification in these enzymes has some degree of heterogeneity, since some peptides are always found in a fully phosphorylated state whereas others appeared phosphorylated only in part of the native protein kinase population. Refer to Table 2 for further details.

mechanisms. In agreement with this hypothesis, fully dephosphorylated peptides corresponding to the activation loops and juxtamembrane regions were recovered upon treatment with PstP from all the four kinases utilized in this study (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that kinase autophosphorylation is a reversible process in vivo, in which the Ser/Thr protein phosphatase PstP could play a major regulatory role. A conserved phosphorylation pattern in mycobacterial Ser/Thr protein kinases A first general feature that emerges from this study is that threonine residues are more often phosphorylated than serine residues (Table 2), probably reflecting a certain degree of protein kinase specificity. Further, two protein regions appeared systematically phosphorylated in the four enzymes studied: the activation loop in the

catalytic domain and a sequence close to the C-terminus of the intracellular constructions, corresponding to the juxtamembrane segment connecting the catalytic domain to the transmembrane region (Fig. 5). Additional scattered sites were detected for some kinases in the N-terminal region and in some regions of the catalytic domain distinct from the activation loop (Table 2). Most of these sites were only partially phosphorylated and, when mapped onto the 3 D structure of the PknB catalytic domain [25], corresponded to exposed loop regions of the protein, probably facilitating its partial, non-specific phosphorylation. Although some of these sites may be relevant for kinase activity, they were not further investigated in this work. Activation loop autophosphorylation and kinase activity At least two fully phosphorylated Thr residues in the activation loop were identified in all four mycobacterial kinases, except for PknE, for which mono-, di-, and triphosphorylated peptides at Thr170, Thr175, and Thr178 were detected in different preparations (Table 2; Fig. 6A). PknB sequence 162≠189 including the activation loop largely occurs as a diphosphorylated peptide

whose autophosphorylation pattern has been studied in detail, suggesting a conserved activation loop mechanism to regulate kinase activity. In eukaryotic kinases, the activation loop is known to undergo large conformational changes associated with enzyme activation [20]. In particular, the phosphate group from one of the central loop residues usually forms an ion pair with a conserved arginine residue, Arg165 in the eukaryotic cAMP-dependent protein kinase [27] and Arg137 in mycobacterial PknB [15,25]. This conserved arginine is situated in the catalytic loop of the kinase domain, adjacent to a critical aspartic acid residue, and its interaction with pThr (pSer) residues from the activation loop is thought to be important to achieve the proper conformation of the active site for catalysis. Indeed, we have shown that this is the case for PknB, where the mutation of Thr171 and Thr173 resulted in a significantly decreased activity towards MBP (Fig. 6B) [14]. Similar results were obtained for B. subtilis PrkC, where the replacement of four autophosphorylated Thr residues in the activation loop with Ala substantially reduced the enzymatic activity with additive effect [26], lending strong support to a regulatory role of the activation loop in these receptor-like bacterial kinases. This may also be the case for the other three analyzed mycobacterial kinases, given the presence of conserved pThr in the activation loop (Fig. 6A) and the conservation of the RD motif too (data not shown). Moreover, recent results from our laboratory indicate a direct involvement of Thr171 and Thr173 of PknB not only in the regulation of kinase activity, but also in a process of activation loop-mediated recruitment of its substrate [28]. Phosphorylation sites in the juxtamembrane segments The second region displaying a systematic pattern of autophosphorylation in all four kinases is the juxtamembrane segment (Fig. 5). Two phosphoresidues could be unambiguously identified for PknB (Thr294, Thr309) and PknF (Thr287, Ser290), while the covalent modifications in PknD and PknE appear more complex, with up to six sites diversely modified (Table 2). This complexity might be due, at least in part, to a higher accessibility of the juxtamembrane region in the recombinant (soluble) protein as compared to the membrane-bound enzyme in vivo. To investigate whether phosphorylated residues in this region could affect kinase activity, we constructed deletion mutants of the four protein kinases that included only the catalytic domain, without the juxtamembrane region. Soluble and active proteins were obtained for PknB and PknF. In both the cases, the autophosphorylation and the activity against MBP were little or not affected (Fig. 7), strongly suggesting that juxtamembrane phosphorylation is not required for

(Thr171 and Thr173). For PknD, residues Thr169 and Thr173 are always phosphorylated, while Thr171 is only present in a minor triphosphorylated peptide fraction. The corresponding sequence for PknF was always present as a diphosphorylated peptide at Thr173 and Thr175 (Fig. 6A). These phosphorylation patterns were not significantly affected after incubation of the purified proteins with ATP, indicating that the kinase autophosphorylation reactions mostly occur during protein expression in E. coli. To investigate whether phosphorylation of the activation loop affects kinase activity, we selected PknB (which has the more homogeneous pattern of phosphorylation among the four kinases studied here) and substituted the two pThr residues (Thr171 and Thr173) by alanine [14]. As shown in Fig. 6B, each single mutant had 10to 20-fold less activity on MBP than the wild-type enzyme, whereas the double mutant had near 300-fold less activity. These results confirm that phosphorylation of the activation loop has a strong effect on PknB kinase activity. Similar results have been observed for PrkC from Bacillus subtilis [26], the only other bacterial STPK

the catalytic activity, as also observed for B. subtilis PrkC [26]. However, the consistent pattern of modifications observed in this region argues for a role of juxtamembrane phosphorylation in activity regulation or protein stability (Fig. 5). A possible mechanism might resemble those reported for eukaryotic receptors such as the type I TGF-b Ser/Thr kinase [29] or the ephrin Tyr kinase EphB2 [30], in which phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane region modulates its interaction with the catalytic domain. Alternatively, juxtamembrane phosphorylation may be important for the recruitment of other proteins involved in a putative signaling cascade and/or coupling to other signaling pathways, as it has been suggested for B. subtilis PrkC [26]. Future work will unravel the gating signals that switch the autophosphorylation activity in vivo, and will clarify the role of these transmembrane protein kinases in mycobacterial signaling.
