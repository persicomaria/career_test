Abstract: Sanglifehrin A (SFA) is a novel immunosuppressive natural product isolated from Streptomyces sp. A92-308110. SFA has a very strong affinity for cyclophilin A (IC50 ) 6.9 ( 0.9 nM) but is structurally different from cyclosporin A (CsA) and exerts its immunosuppressive activity via a novel mechanism. SFA has a complex molecular structure consisting of a 22-membered macrocycle, bearing in position 23 a ninecarbon tether terminated by a highly substituted spirobicyclic moiety. Selective oxidative cleavage of the C26dC27 exocyclic double bond affords the spirolactam containing fragment 1 and macrolide 2. The affinity of 2 for cyclophilin (IC50 ) 29 ( 2.1 nM) is essentially identical to SFA, which indicates that the interaction between SFA and cyclophilin A is mediated exclusively by the macrocyclic portion of the molecule. This observation was confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure resolved at 2.1 Å of cyclophilin A complexed to macrolide 16, a close analogue of 2. The X-ray crystal structure showed that macrolide 16 binds to the same deep hydrophobic pocket of cyclophilin A as CsA. Additional valuable details of the structure-activity relationship were obtained by two different chemical approaches: (1) degradation work on macrolide 2 or (2) synthesis of a library of macrolide analogues using the ring-closing metathesis reaction as the key step. Altogether, it appears that the complex macrocyclic fragment of SFA is a highly optimized combination of multiple functionalities including an (E,E)-diene, a short polypropionate fragment, and an unusual tripeptide unit, which together provide an extremely strong affinity for cyclophilin A.

Introduction

More than two decades ago, the discovery of cyclosporin A (CsA, Figure 1) allowed a spectacular progress in the field of organ transplantation.1 Since then, the number of transplanted organs has grown continuously and the search for novel immunosuppressants has intensified.2 These efforts resulted in the isolation of several immunosuppressants from natural sources which interfere with T cell activation or proliferation. The most prominent examples are FK506 and rapamycin (Figure 1). Besides their important therapeutic use, these drugs have also proven to be powerful tools for dissecting signal transduction

pathways at the molecular level.3 It has been shown that the biological activity of CsA, FK506, and rapamycin is mediated by intracellular binding proteins called immunophilins. CsA binds to cyclophilins (CyP), whereas FK506 and rapamycin bind to FK506-binding proteins (FKBP) (Figure 2). However, although immunophilin binding is required, it is not sufficient for the immunosuppressive activity of these drugs. Biological effects are observed only upon interaction of the drug/immunophilin complexes with a third partner, the effector protein. Thus, the CyP-CsA and FKBP-FK506 complexes inhibit the serine/threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin, thereby blocking the production of cytokines including interleukin-2.4 On the other hand, the FKBP-rapamycin complex inhibits a kinase called FRAP (also known as RAFT or mTOR)5 that is involved in interleukin-2 receptor-mediated T cell proliferation.6

Considering that different ligands for FKBP exert their biological effects by different mechanisms, we wondered whether besides CsA other ligands of cyclophilin might exist and whether these ligands would exhibit different modes of action than CsA.

sanglifehrins.7 Among the 20 different sanglifehrins isolated so far, sanglifehrin A (SFA) is the most abundant component (Scheme 1). The affinity of SFA for cyclophilin in a cell-free competitive binding assay is remarkably high (IC50 ) 6.9 ( 0.9 nM),8 approximately 60-fold higher than that of CsA (IC50 ) 420 ( 56 nM). SFA displays potent immunosuppressive activity in the murine mixed lymphocyte reaction (IC50 ) 170 ( 30 nM), an in vitro immune response assay.

pressive activity at the molecular level is currently under investigation, and the first results were published recently.9 These data clearly indicate that SFA represents a novel type of immunosuppressant whose mode of action is different from that of all other known immunophilin-binding compounds, namely CsA, FK506, and rapamycin. In addition to its fascinating biological activity, sanglifehrin A has a complex and unique molecular structure. The compound consists of a 22-membered macrocycle, bearing in position 23 a nine-carbon tether terminated by a highly substituted spirobicyclic moiety. The macrolide contains an (E,E)-diene, a short polypropionate fragment, and a tripeptide unit composed of valine and two rather unusual amino acids, piperazic acid and meta-tyrosine. Interestingly, it is the -nitrogen of piperazic acid that is involved in the amide bond formation. This stands in contrast to all other piperazic acid containing natural products isolated so far. The structural attractiveness of sanglifehrin, combined with its immunosuppressive activity, generated broad interest in industrial and academic laboratories. Their efforts resulted in the preparation of several fragments10 and finally culminated in the total syntheses by Nicolaou et al.11 and Paquette et al.12 Despite the structural complexity of SFA, selective cleavage of the C26dC27 exocyclic double bond could be achieved by a

two-step procedure (Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation, periodate oxidation) (Scheme 1).13 This approach allowed an efficient preparation of the spirolactam containing fragment 1 and macrolide 2. Fragment 1 by itself does not bind to cyclophilin (IC50 g 5000 nM). On the other hand, the removal of the C27-N42 subunit has only a minor effect on the affinity of macrolide 2 for cyclophilin (IC50 ) 29 ( 2.1 nM). But surprisingly, neither of the two fragments exhibits immunosuppressive activity. Based on these initial observations, we initiated a two-phase synthetic effort. First, we aimed at further reducing the complexity of the macrocycle while maintaining its affinity for cyclophilin. During this phase, particular emphasis was put on reducing the overall polarity of the molecule. Indeed, it is believed that the high number of polar functional groups of the sanglifehrin class of substances is responsible for their poor cell permeation.14 In the second phase, we planned to recombine suitable macrolides with various side chains in order to restore the immunosuppressive activity.15 Herein, we will discuss in detail our findings related to the interaction between the macrolide fragment of sanglifehrin A and cyclophilin. An overview of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) was obtained either by degradation work on 2 or by synthesis of a library of macrolide analogues based on the ring-closing metathesis reaction. In addition, we disclose the first X-ray crystal structure of a sanglifehrin derivative, macrolide 16, bound to cyclophilin A.
Chemistry

Degradation Work on Macrolide 2. The syntheses of the new derivatives are summarized in Schemes 2 and 3. To assess the role of the ketone in the side chain attached at C14, sanglifehrin A was reduced with NaBH4. The resulting mixture of epimeric alcohols could be selectively converted into the epimeric iodo derivatives 3, which were not separated and were obtained in 48% yield over two steps. The other hydroxy groups in the molecule did not react under these conditions, most probably due to steric hindrance. Compound 3 could be selectively dihydroxylated at the C26dC27 double bond, and the resulting diol could be oxidatively cleaved under the same conditions used for sanglifehrin A to afford macrolide 4. We then concentrated our efforts on modifying the conjugated C18-C21 (E,E)-diene system of the macrocyclic fragment. Hydrogenation of 2 in the presence of Pd/C resulted in reduction of both the C18-C21 (E,E)-diene system and the C24dC25 exocyclic double bond, affording the fully saturated macrocycle 5 as an epimeric mixture at C24. Selective hydrogenation of the (E,E)-diene system only could not be achieved under a variety of conditions. The lack of selectivity during the hydrogenation of macrolide 2 might be associated with the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde at C26. In the case of sanglifehrin A, it is indeed possible to obtain selectively the C18-C21 tetrahydro derivative using Wilkinson's rhodium catalyst. The reduction of both carbonyl groups of 2 could be achieved in quantitative yield using NaBH4 to afford the tetraol 6. Under acidic conditions (aqueous HCl, dioxane), 6 was converted into

The fully conjugated tetraene, which could potentially be generated by the additional elimination of the alcohol at C15 of 7 was not detected even after prolonged acidic treatment. Triene 7 proved to be unstable even when stored at -4 °C. We next focused our attention on modifying the potentially reactive R, -unsaturated aldehyde (Scheme 3). The reaction of macrolide 2 with phosphonoacetates under modified WittigHorner conditions provided the esters 8 and 9 in 50% and 34% yield, respectively. In this case, no protection of the other functionalities in the macrolide was required. But for further derivation of the aldehyde under strongly basic conditions, the keto-diol was transformed quantitatively into the ketal 10 under mild acidic conditions.

as described previously for the resynthesis of sanglifehrin A from degradation products.13 The desired 5-(alkane-1-sulfonyl)1-phenyl-1H-tetrazoles were prepared from the commercially available primary alcohols in two steps according to the procedure outlined by Kocienski et al.18 In the presence of 2 equiv. of NaHMDS, the olefination procedure afforded the ketalprotected forms of dienes 11 and 12 in 74% and 49% yield, respectively. In both cases, the (E,E)-diene products were formed with very high selectivity (g10:1). Acidic hydrolysis of the intramolecular ketal afforded the desired macrolides 11 and 12. Typically, the latter reaction reached an equilibrium at 50% conversion.13 Finally, the reaction between the macrolide and an unstabilized Wittig reagent required an additional protection of the phenol with a tert-butyldimethylsilyl group. The fully protected aldehyde 13 was conveniently obtained using N-(tert(18) The sulfones were prepared according to following scheme:

Aldehyde 13 was then allowed to react with methyltriphenylphosphonium bromide in the presence of LiHMDS at -78 °C to afford the fully protected form of 14 in 39% yield. The latter was sequentially deprotected using tetrabutylammonium fluoride followed by standard acidic conditions. The primary alcohol 15 was obtained in excellent yield by reduction of aldehyde 13 with NaBH4. Complete deprotection of 15 led to alcohol 16, which was used for cocrystallization

with cyclophilin A (see X-ray crystal structure section). Macrolide 15 was also used to modify the free R-nitrogen of piperazic acid and probe its role in mediating the binding to cyclophilin. Methylation of macrolide 15 using trifluoromethanesulfonic acid methyl ester in the presence of a hindered base, 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, afforded a mixture of di- and monomethylated products, which, upon deprotection, gave 17 and 18, respectively.

al form resulting from addition of the C15 hydroxyl to the carbonyl in the side chain,13 the content of the hemiketal form of 17 and 18 was increased to 50%. Design and Construction of a Library of Macrolide Analogues. Further manipulation of the functional groups present in macrolide 2 was difficult. Therefore, we switched to a fully synthetic approach to prepare a library of simplified macrolides.19 For our first generation of analogues, we planned to keep the tripeptide fragment, which forms all the hydrogen bonds with cyclophilin, mostly intact. In addition, at least one double bond was maintained in the C13-C23 subunit to reduce the conformational flexibility of the 22-membered macrocycle. With this basic scaffold in mind, a retrosynthetic analysis showed that several routes can be considered for the construction of the macrocycles: macrolactonization, macrolactamization, Stille coupling, and ring-closing metathesis (RCM). The latter approach was particularly attractive because the macrolides can be rapidly assembled from relatively simple building blocks in a highly convergent manner. For the selection of the building blocks, the macrolide was divided into three fragments: the tripeptide, the polypropionate fragment C13-C18, and the carbon skeleton extending from C19 to C26. An overview of the 10 selected building blocks is shown in Figure 3. Three different protected tripeptide fragments were prepared. Tripeptide 19 corresponds to the original motive found in the sanglifehrins. In the two other tripeptides, 20 and 21, the unusual amino acids meta-tyrosine and piperazic acid were replaced by phenylalanine and/or nipecotic acid, respectively. These modifications were introduced to investigate the influence of the phenolic hydroxyl and of the R-nitrogen of piperazic acid on cyclophilin binding. Three building blocks were considered for the C19-C26 fragment. In two of them, 22 and 23, the side chain attached at C23 was neglected, thus eliminating one asymmetric

center. The comparison between the final products resulting from alkene 22 and diene 23 would allow us to assess the relative importance of the C18-C21 diene. The possible role of the side chain attached at C23 in stabilizing the 3-dimensional conformation of the macrolide could be tested using fragment 24. Finally, four fragments were prepared as analogues of the polypropionate portion extending from C13 to C18. Based on the results obtained by degradation of macrolide 2, the hydroxy group at C17 was not considered during the planning phase. For similar reasons, the side chain attached at C14 was simplified to a methyl group. The stereochemistry of the methyl group at C16 was maintained in fragments 25-27, because this substituent, directed toward the internal face of the macrolide (see discussion of the X-ray crystal structure), was thought to play an important role in stabilizing the three-dimensional structure of the macrolide. Fragments 25-27 were synthesized in order to analyze the influence of the stereochemistry at C14 and C15 on the affinity of the macrolides for cyclophilin. Fragment 27 corresponds to the original stereochemistry found in these positions for SFA. Commercially available 6-heptenoic acid 28 was added to the list in order to study the overall impact of the substituents of the polypropionate fragment on cyclophilin binding. The details of the synthesis of the tripeptide unit 19 are described in Scheme 4.19,20 The selection of the three orthogonal protecting groups (Tce, TBDMS, and Boc) was crucial to allow the desired synthetic flexibility during the final stage of macrolide assemblage. The synthesis of the tripeptide fragment 19 began with the preparation of benzyl-protected meta-tyrosine in a chiral form. The alkylation of the bis(lactim) ether (Schollkopf auxiliary) 29 with 3-benzyloxybenzyl bromide ¨ provided intermediate 30 with 89% diastereoselectivity.21 The undesired isomer was readily separated by flash chromatogra(20) The syntheses of the tripeptides 20 and 21 were described previously: Wagner, J.; Martin Cabrejas, L.

phy. The bis(lactim) ether 30 was cleaved under strongly acidic conditions, and the resulting amine was coupled to Boc-protected valine to afford the dipeptide 31 in 50% yield over two steps. The latter was saponified and coupled to 2,2,2-trichloroethylprotected piperazic acid using the mixed anhydride method to provide tripeptide 32. Optically pure piperazic acid was obtained in multigram quantities by the procedure described by Hale et al.22 The benzyl group of 32 was removed by hydrogenolysis in 2-propanol and replaced by the TBDMS group to afford the desired fragment 19. Use of a less hindered alcohol during the debenzylation resulted in partial transesterification of the trichloroethyl ester. Tripeptide 19 was thus prepared in seven steps and 18% overall yield. 5-Hexen-1-ol 22 is commercially available, and 3,5-hexadien1-ol 23 was prepared according to published procedures.23 The synthesis of optically pure 24 is described in Scheme 5.24 7-Octen-2-one 33 was prepared according to known procedures on a multigram scale.25 Sharpless dihydroxylation of the intermediate silylenolether 34 afforded the highly volatile R-hydroxy ketone 35 in 27% yield from 33. The reaction proceeded in 89% ee as determined by 19F NMR of the Mosher ester derivative of 35. Protection of 35 with a tert-butyldimethylsilyl group followed by a Wittig-Horner reaction with triethyl phosphonoacetate in the presence of sodium hydride afforded the ester 36 in good yield. The ester was reduced with DIBAL-H to the primary alcohol, which was methylated. Final deprotection of the secondary alcohol afforded the desired

building block 24 in 69% yield over three steps. This synthetic route allowed straightforward access to 24 on a multigram scale. Finally, we focused our attention on the synthesis of building blocks 25-27 for the polypropionate fragment C13-C18. The preparation of all three fragments was based on the same chiral aldehyde, (S,E)-2-methyl-hex-4-enal 37, which was available in multigram quantities.26 The corresponding (R)-enantiomer of 37 is a crucial intermediate for the synthesis of a unique amino acid, MeBmt, which is part of the structure of cyclosporin A.27 The additional methyl group attached to the double bond would be lost during the final ring-closing metathesis step. Building blocks 25 and 26 with the syn stereochemistry between C15 and C16 were prepared using Evans' aldol methodology (Scheme 6).28 The reaction between the (R)-imide 38 and aldehyde 37 in the presence of freshly prepared dibutylboron triflate29 at -78 °C gave the desired aldol adduct 39 as a single diastereoisomer in excellent yield (92%). On the other hand, the reaction of the (S)-imide 40 with 37 resulted in a sluggish reaction, which afforded 41 in 43% yield. HPLC analysis showed that 41 contained approximately 10-20% of the C3 epimer.30 The slow reaction is probably caused by the mismatch situation between the R-methyl group of the aldehyde and the benzyl of the imide. The epimers could be separated by reverse phase HPLC, but the bulk material was carried through and separated only at the macrolide stage. The chiral auxiliary was removed under standard conditions to afford the acids 25 and 26 in 76% and 64% yield, respectively. While the formation of syn aldol adducts is well documented, only few efficient methodologies allowing the formation of anti aldol products in high diastereoselectivity and yield have been published. In the case of aldehydes possessing a chiral center in the R position, examples are very scarce. The synthesis of fragment 27, possessing the

same stereochemistry as sanglifehrin, required an anti aldol reaction. First, we tested the Heathcock modification of Evans' aldol reaction.31 Unfortunately, complexation of the additional Lewis acid, Et2AlCl or TiCl4, to aldehyde 37 caused racemization. We then turned our attention to Oppolzer's sultam as the chiral auxiliary.32 The condensation of aldehyde 37 with the intermediate silyl enolate 43 obtained from sultam 42 formed the desired anti aldol product with excellent diastereoselective control (Scheme 7). Indeed, the anti aldol adduct 44 was isolated as a single diastereoisomer and in excellent yield (91%) after flash chromatography. The relative stereochemistry was confirmed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 4). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the formation an anti aldol adduct obtained by reacting sultam 42 with an R-methy(31) Walker, M. A.; Heathcock, C. H. J. Org.

lated chiral aldehyde. Cleavage of the chiral auxiliary under standard basic conditions afforded the acid 27 in 53% yield. With all the building blocks in our hands, we started to assemble the macrolide library according to Scheme 8. Removal of the Boc group from tripeptides 19-21 in the presence of TFA or TMSOTf in CH2Cl2, followed by coupling of the resulting amines to building blocks 25-28, afforded compounds 45a-j. Methyl ester hydrolysis or selective deprotection of the trichloroethyl ester group with zinc provided the corresponding acids, which were esterified with the alcohols 22-24 under Mitsunobu conditions. The precursors 46a-j for the ring-closing metathesis reaction were thus obtained in good overall yield. At this stage, the precursors with a free hydroxy group at C15, 46e-i, were protected with a tert-butyldimethylsilyl group. In the presence of this protecting group, the subsequent metathesis reaction was faster and proceeded in higher yields. The ruthenium-based catalyst first described by Grubbs et al. was used for the critical macrocyclization step.33 The best yields were obtained in CH2Cl2 under reflux and high dilution (<5 mM). Under these conditions, the alkene or diene macrolides 47a-j were obtained in good to excellent yields (50-80%) after

HPLC purification (Table 1). The additional methyl group attached to the alkene (entries 5-9) did not affect the yield of the RCM reaction. Macrolide 47g, the C15 epimer of 47f, could be separated as a side product (<5%) by reverse-phase HPLC from 47f after macrocyclization and desilylation. This product arises from the presence of a minor isomer present in the macrocyclization substrate 46f. This isomer has its origin in the Evans aldol reaction leading to acid 26, as indicated previously. X-ray Crystal Structure of Macrolide 16 Bound to Cyclophilin. The X-ray crystal structure of macrolide 16 bound to cyclophilin was determined and allowed further insight into the ligand-protein interactions. The resolution of the complex was 2.1 Å, and the final R-factor, 16.4%. The crystal structure revealed the details of the interaction between the sanglifehrin macrolide and cyclophilin (Figure 5a and b). Similarly to cyclosporin A, the macrocyclic subunit of sanglifehrin A binds to the active site of cyclophilin A, which is an enzyme that catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl peptide bonds.1 Accordingly, both CsA and SFA inhibit the catalytic activity of the enzyme.8 The tripeptide Pip-meta-Tyr-Val is located deep in the binding pocket and forms all hydrogen bonds with the protein. This portion of the ligand will be referred to as the recognition domain. The C13-C26 fragment, that we would call the spacer domain, extends on the surface of the complex and does not undergo any direct interactions with cyclophilin. The spacer domain might play a critical role in maintaining the molecule in the optimal three-dimensional conformation. Six direct hydrogen bonds (cutoff 3.4 Å) could be identified between the recognition domain and four amino acids of the protein. Three amino acids of the protein (Arg55, Gln63, and

His126) make intermolecular hydrogen bonds through their side chains, while one amino acid (Asn102) forms an antiparallel -sheet interaction with the ligand. In detail, these hydrogen bonds are located between NE2-His126 and the meta-tyrosine hydroxy group (2.69 Å/2.65 Å), between the main chain nitrogen of Asn102 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of meta-tyrosine (2.97 Å/2.92 Å), between the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn102 and the main chain nitrogen of meta-tyrosine (2.75 Å/2.83 Å), between NE2-Gln63 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of valine (3.04 Å/3.01 Å), between OE1-Gln63 and the R-nitrogen of the piperazic acid (3.03 Å/3.00 Å), and between NH2-Arg55 and the carbonyl oxygen of the ester moiety (3.31 Å/3.20 Å). In the latter list, distances are given between heteroatoms in the two independently refined complexes of the asymmetric unit (the averaged values are displayed in Figure 5b). The piperazic acid moiety of macrolide 16 occupies the same deep hydrophobic groove of cyclophilin A that is used by the side chain of Me-Val11 of cyclosporin A1 or by the proline ring of the model substrate Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala.34 The hydrophobic pocket is formed by Phe60, Met61, Phe113, and Leu122. The 3-oxobutyl side chain attached at C14 extends on the surface of the complex and does not form any obvious interaction with the protein. The C15 hydroxy group points toward a pocket in the cyclophilin structure occupied by water molecules. As mentioned earlier, the methyl group at C16 is directed toward the interior surface of the macrolide and the C17 hydroxyl is exposed to the solvent. Altogether, it appears that the spacer domain is essential to induce the optimal 3-dimensional conformation of the macrolide, which would allow a perfect fit of the recognition domain in the catalytic site of cyclophilin A.

Biological Evaluation of Macrolides and Discussion. The macrolides obtained by derivatization of 2 as well as the synthetic analogues were screened for their affinity for cyclophilin A in a competitive binding assay. In this assay, the interaction between solid-phase coated SFA-BSA conjugates and biotinylated cyclophilin is inhibited by free SFA in solution.35 The IC50 value for sanglifehrin A in this assay is 6.9 ( 0.9 nM.8 The results obtained with the new derivatives, summarized in Table 2, reveal a number of important structureactivity relationships. Macrolide 16 exhibits the same affinity to cyclophilin as the parent compound, clearly indicating that the binding of sanglifehrin A is fully mediated by the macrocyclic portion. Various modifications of the side chain attached at C23 (derivatives 8, 9, 11, 12, and 14) have little effect on the

binding affinity. Sufficient space is available to accommodate side chains of different lengths and containing ester or hydroxy functionalities. This is in agreement with the fact that removal of the spirolactam moiety of SFA results only in the loss of immunosuppressive activity but not in affinity for cyclophilin A. In contrast, full hydrogenation of all double bonds to form the hexahydro derivative 5 results in a 7- or 35-fold loss in affinity in comparison to 2 and 16, respectively. Thus, the diene system is important for fine-tuning the three-dimensional conformation of the macrocycle and confirms our initial working hypothesis. The C54 carbonyl group, which is in equilibrium with its intramolecular hemiketal form in solution, is not important for the binding activity. Indeed, reduction to the alcohol, as in macrolide 6, does not affect the affinity. Nevertheless, the reduced affinity of 4 over 2 suggests that

so far. Finally, the addition of a C23 side chain and the metatyrosine hydroxyl to 47b, leading to 47j, did not significantly improve the affinity.

oxygen is preferred over iodine in this position. Finally, the good affinity retained by triene 7 shows that the C17 hydroxyl is not critical for binding. This conclusion is supported by analysis of the X-ray crystal structure, which shows that this hydroxyl is exposed to the solvent. Furthermore, it appears that the overall conformation of the macrocycle is not greatly affected by the additional double bond. Derivatives 17 and 18, in which the free R-nitrogen of piperazic acid is methylated, are inactive. This observation confirms that the hydrogen bond formed between the free R-nitrogen of piperazic acid and OE1Gln63 is crucial for binding to cyclophilin. It is interesting to note that this interaction is mediated by a structural feature, which is unique to the sanglifehrins. Therefore, it is not surprising that the replacement of piperazic acid by nipecotic acid in compound 47a also leads to a substance that does not bind to cyclophilin. All the synthetic macrolide analogues, 47b-47j, retain only modest affinity in the micromolar range. Among those, 47d combines the complete recognition domain with the (E,E)-diene unit. The binding data of 47d prove that these two fragments of the macrolide are certainly necessary but not sufficient to achieve high affinity for cyclophilin as hypothesized initially. The role of the three stereocenters at C14, C15, and C16 of the polypropionate fragment was assessed with compounds 47e47i. To our surprise, the stereochemistry at C14 and C15 had only a minor impact on the binding to cyclophilin. Compound 47i, which combines the absolute configurations of the C14C16 stereocenters found in sanglifehrin A with the (E,E)-diene moiety, remained the most potent synthetic derivative prepared

The interaction between the macrocyclic moiety of sanglifehrin A and cyclophilin was studied in detail. The X-ray crystal structure of the cyclophilin A-macrolide 16 complex was resolved at 2.1 Å and provided detailed insight into the ligandprotein interactions. In addition, a series of macrolide analogues was prepared either by derivatization of macrolide 2, resulting from selective degradation of sanglifehrin A, or via a synthetic approach using the ring-closing metathesis reaction as the key step. The latter work confirmed the potential of the RCM reaction for rapidly assembling a library of macrolides of variable complexity. Altogether, the X-ray crystal structure and the synthetic work proved that the high affinity of sanglifehrin A for cyclophilin A is mediated exclusively by the macrocyclic portion of the molecule. More surprising was the finding that the complex macrocyclic structure is a highly optimized combination of multiple functionalities including a rather unusual tripeptide, an (E,E)-diene unit, and a polypropionate portion, which together provide an extremely strong affinity for cyclophilin. The "original" sanglifehrin A macrocycle 2 allows for some, mostly single or double, modifications which do not greatly affect binding. On the other hand, simultaneous modifications of several positions, including removal of substituents, configurational changes, and functional group modifications, as in the synthetic macrolides 47a-j, result in a significant loss of affinity for cyclophilin.
