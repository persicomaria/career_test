Advances in the structural biology of bacterial transcription have come from studies of RNA polymerases (RNAPs) from the thermophilic eubacteria Thermus aquaticus (Taq) and Thermus thermophilus (Tth). These structural studies have been limited by the fact that only endogenous Taq or Tth RNAP, laboriously purified from large quantities of Taq or Tth cell paste and offering few options for genetic modification, is suitable for structural studies. Recombinant systems for the preparation of Taq RNAP by co-overexpression and assembly in the heterologous host, Escherichia coli, have been described, but these did not yield enzyme suitable for crystallographic studies. Here we describe recombinant systems for the preparation of Taq RNAP harboring full or partial deletions of the Taq b 0 non-conserved domain (NCD), yielding enzyme suitable for crystallographic studies. This opens the way for structural studies of genetically manipulated enzymes, allowing the preparation of more crystallizable enzymes and facilitating detailed structure/function analysis. Characterization of the Taqb 0 NCD deletion mutants generated in this study showed that the b 0 NCD is important for the efficient binding of the s subunit, confirming previous hypotheses. Finally, preliminary structural analysis ° (at 4.1 A resolution) of one of the recombinant mutants revealed a previously unobserved conformation of the b-flap, further defining the range of conformations accessible to this flexible structural element.

Introduction
In all cellular organisms, RNA is synthesized by a complex molecular machine, the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). In its simplest form, the enzyme comprises four subunits with a total molecular mass of around 400 kDa. The sequences of the subunits that make up the RNAP core component (subunit composition a2bb 0 u in bacteria) are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to man.1­3 Sequence conservation points to structural and functional homologies, and indeed the structures of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes are

even more conserved than predicted from sequence conservation alone.4­8 Since its isolation more than four decades ago,9 our current level of functional understanding of the transcription cycle has accumulated through decades of genetic, biochemical, and biophysical studies of Escherichia coli (Ec) RNAP. However, despite much effort, crystals of Ec RNAP suitable for X-ray crystallography have not been reported, and structural work has been limited to low-resolution electron crystallography of helical crystals or high-resolution X-ray crystallographic analysis of individual RNAP subunits or domains.3,10­14 Recent advances in the structural biology of prokaryotic transcription have come from studies of RNAPs from the eubacterial thermophiles Thermus aquaticus (Taq) and Thermus thermophilus (Tth). Nevertheless, these structural studies have been limited by the fact that only endogenous Taq or Tth RNAP, laboriously purified from large quantities of Taq or Tth biomass, is available for structural studies.

The isolation of the endogenous RNAP from the native Thermus cells imposes significant limitations. Much more limiting than the labor and cost of obtaining the purified enzyme is the fact that there is no opportunity for genetic modification of the enzyme, since systems for the facile genetic manipulation of Taq or Tth have not been developed. There are compelling reasons to genetically manipulate the enzyme for structural studies. For instance, various aspects of enzyme function, regulation, or inhibition by antibiotics could be investigated through the use of site-directed mutants or deletions. Moreover, floppy, independently folded domains that protrude from the RNAP structure, which would be expected to hinder the formation of well-ordered crystals, could be truncated to create a more "crystallizable" enzyme. In principle, totally recombinant Thermus RNAP could be obtained in two ways, by in vitro reconstitution through refolding of individually overexpressed, denatured subunits,15­17 or through simultaneous coexpression of all the subunits.18,19 While in vitro reconstitution is an important tool that allows functional studies of dominant negative RNAP mutants that would otherwise be impossible,20­23 it is highly unlikely that this method could be used to prepare the large amounts of homogeneous RNAP

required for structural studies. Therefore, we opted for a co-expression strategy and designed several recombinant constructs of Taq RNAP. While the initial construct expressing wild-type Taq RNAP a, b, and b 0 subunits gave high yields of functional enzyme,18,19 it was not suitable for structural studies since crystals could not be obtained. Nevertheless, we have prepared several recombinant Taq RNAP mutants rationally engineered to increase the crystallizability by deleting all or parts of the Taq b 0 non-conserved domain (Taqb 0 NCD).11 The resulting recombinant Taq RNAPs are functional, but biochemical analysis provides support for a role of the Taqb 0 NCD in s factor binding. The recombinant enzymes engineered for crystallizability form crystals suitable for structural studies. The structure from one of these crystals ° has been solved to 4.1 A resolution.

RNAP subunits.24 The overexpressed subunits assemble in vivo, and the core RNAP can be purified with good yields (25 mg/l Ec culture). The rEcRNAP is functionally indistinguishable from the endogenous enzyme, and it is also suitable for structural studies as it forms well-ordered helical crystals useful for electron microscopy studies.13 These expression systems have also been utilized to obtain mutant enzymes for functional studies.24 We took a similar approach to obtain a recombinant system for Taq RNAP suitable for both functional and structural studies. We obtained recombinant Taq RNAP (rTaqRNAP) using pET28rpoABHisCTaq, a pET28-based Ec plasmid that co-overexpressed Taq core RNAP subunits from multiple T7 RNAP promoters (Table 1). pET28rpoABHisCTaq expressed the Taq rpoA, rpoB, and rpoC genes coding for the a, b, and b 0 subunits, respectively, but lacked the rpoZ (u) gene (Table 1). The u subunit is not crucial for basic RNAP function in vitro, and deletion of rpoZ in Ec has no apparent phenotype.25 To facilitate purification, the plasmid-borne b 0 was tagged with an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag. rTaqRNAP(Du) was purified by heat treatment of co-overproducing Ec cell lysates, affinity chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography, and was shown to be indistinguishable from endogenous Taq RNAP (eTaqRNAP) in a battery of functional tests.18,19 However, the behavior of the two enzymes during crystallization was different. The eTaqRNAP core enzyme readily forms large crystals (Figure 1(a)) ° that diffract X-rays to 3.1 A resolution at suitable synchrotron beamlines (Figure 1(b); Table 2). At similar conditions, rTaqRNAP(Du) only forms spherulites that do not diffract X-rays (Figure 1(c)). Extensive screens for alternative crystallization conditions with the rTaqRNAP(Du) enzyme have not yielded any promising leads. The absence of u in rTaqRNAP(Du) was not responsible for the lack of crystal growth, since rTaqRNAP prepared from cells harboring a plasmid co-expressing all Taq rpo genes also failed to form crystals. Since heat treatment of the eTaqRNAP had no deleterious effect on crystallization (data not shown), the lack of rTaqRNAP crystallization may have been due to formation of hybrid enzymes containing a mixture of Ec and Taq subunits. Using interspecies RNAP assembly in vitro, we previously showed that the b and b 0 subunits could not be swapped between Ec and Taq RNAPs, while a can be swapped with very low efficiency.18 However, even trace amounts of hybrid enzyme could poison crystallization without having a detectable effect in functional assays. The preparations of rTaqRNAP were therefore analyzed using sensitive methods such as affinity-labeling26­28 and Western-blotting with Ec RNAP subunit-specific antibodies to detect minute amounts of Ec subunits in the preparation, but no Ec RNAP subunits could be detected.

113 non-conserved, structurally autonomous domains inserted between the conserved segments.11,12,29­32 In Taq RNAP, the most prominent of these is Taqb 0 NCD (Figure 2), which is only found in Taq, Tth, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Thermotoga maritima b 0 .11,30,31 Initial structural models of Taq and Tth RNAP lacked the b 0 NCD due to poor quality of the electron density,4,33 indicating that this domain is ° flexible. Recently, the 2.7 A resolution crystal structure of this insert was determined from crystals of the isolated Taq domain,11 allowing its modeling in the context of the RNAP crystals (Figure 2(b)). The Taq b 0 NCD is formed by five repeats of a previously characterized fold, the sandwich-barrel hybrid motif (SBHM),11,30,31 flexibly linked to each other (repeats a to e, Figure 2(b)). We reasoned that partial or complete misfolding of the b 0 NCD in rTaqRNAP could prevent crystallization while having little effect on in vitro functional tests of the enzyme. Therefore, complete or partial removal of the b 0 NCD could lead to a more crystallizable enzyme.

Preparation and crystallization of recombinant Taq RNAP harboring b 0 deletions The difference between the endogenous and recombinant enzymes in the crystallization assay could be explained by postulating that a domain of Taq RNAP, a domain not important for the basic function of the enzyme, cannot properly fold in the conditions of the Ec cytoplasm. Such a domain is likely absent from Ec RNAP. Structural studies of the multi-subunit RNAPs show that a central ° structural core contained within a w40 A radius sphere centered at the active site Mg2C is essentially identical among all organisms (Figure 2).7,8 This conserved structural core arises from highly conserved sequence elements that are dispersed throughout the b and b 0 subunits or their eukaryotic homologs (Figure 2(a)). On the periphery of the enzyme, the sequences and structures diverge. In the eukaryotic enzymes, the periphery is occupied by additional subunits not found in the bacterial enzymes.5,8 In the bacterial RNAPs, the periphery contains

(a) The bars schematically represent the primary sequences of Taq b 0 (top, pink) and b (bottom, blue).4 Evolutionarily conserved regions among prokaryotes, chloroplast, archaebacteria, and eukaryotes,4 originally defined for b 0 by Jokerst et al.43 and for b 0 by Sweetser et al.,44 are denoted as light green boxes and labelled (A­H for b 0 , A­I for b). The 293 residue Taqb 0 NCD is shown as an inserted sequence below the b 0 sequence. (b) Backbone worm of Taq core RNAP. The two a monomers (aI and aII) and u are colored grey. The large subunits are colored pink (b 0 ) and blue (b) except for the evolutionarily conserved segments highlighted in (a), which are colored green. The active site Mg2C is shown as a magenta sphere. The Taqb 0 NCD is also shown, color-coded as follows: purple, SBHM repeats a and e; yellow, SBHM repeat d; red, SBHM repeats b and c. The extent of the different b 0 NCD deletions is illustrated above the structure. In d0, the entire b 0 NCD (SBHM repeats a­e) is deleted; in d1, only SBHM repeats b, c, and d are deleted; in d2, only SBHM repeats b and c are deleted.

114 Based on sequence alignments, the 293 residue Taq b 0 NCD (Taq b 0 [159-451]) is substituted with a ten residue segment in Ec b 0 (Ec b 0 [166-175]). In the RNAP structure, Taq b 0 residues 159 and 451 are fairly close to each other, with the two a-carbons ° separated by a distance of 11 A. Therefore, we constructed a deletion of the entire Taqb 0 NCD (specifically, Taqb 0 D[159-451], which we call d0; Table 1; Figure 2(b)) in the context of the Taq RNAP co-expression plasmid described above. About 40 mg of highly pure rTaqRNAP-d0 enzyme was obtained from four liters of Ec culture using the procedure developed for rTaqRNAP (Figure 3(a)).

The rTaqRNAP-d0 core RNAP, when combined with excess rTaqsA,19 was as active as rTaqRNAP in in vitro abortive initiation assays on three different promoters (Figure 3(b)), and its elongation and termination properties were also similar to the wild-type enzyme (Figure 3(c)). The results of Chlenov et al.11 indicated that the SBHM repeats a and d of Taqb 0 NCD interact with sA conserved region 1.2, while SBHMe interacts with a region of the non-conserved insert between sA regions 1.2 and 2. These contacts likely contribute to stabilization of the Taq RNAP holoenzyme. Therefore, we tested the ability of rTaqRNAP-d0 to

NTPs were washed out, then the complexes were chased with a set of all four NTPs (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The resulting products were analyzed by 8 M urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide) and phosphorimager analysis.

115 Crystallization of rTaqRNAPs Crystallization screens of rTaqRNAP-d0 yielded two crystal forms (Table 2). Form I microcrystals grew in about one week with polyethylene glycol as a precipitant. These crystals are very small, and experiments are in progress to grow larger crystals suitable for diffraction analysis. Form II crystals grow in about a week from conditions similar to those used for the eTaqRNAP crystallization, or from Li2SO4 as a precipitant (Table 2; Figure 5(a)). The crystals were up to 0.7 mm. Unfrozen crystals, mounted in a capillary, diffracted X-rays generated from a home source to ° about 5 A resolution, similar to the resolution obtained with eTaqRNAP crystals.4 Frozen crystals ° diffracted to around 4 A resolution at sufficiently strong synchrotron beamlines (Table 2). Both rTaqRNAP-d1 and -d2 enzymes produced large crystals with several high-salt precipitants (Table 2). Unfrozen crystals of either enzyme ° diffracted X-rays to about 8 A resolution on our ° resolution at sufficiently home source and about 6 A strong synchrotron beamlines. Structure determination of rTaqRNAP-d0 A full dataset for rTaqRNAP-d0 was collected to ° 4.1 A resolution (Table 3). The structure was solved ° by molecular replacement at 5 A resolution using the eTaqRNAP structure (Figure 2(b)) modified to remove the u subunit as well as the b 0 NCD (see Materials and Methods). An initial rigid body ° refinement at 5 A resolution, followed by density modification using CNS, generated very clear 2jFojKjFcj electron density maps using all reflec° tions to 4.1 A resolution (Figure 5(b)). The maps allowed manual building to account for conformational changes, especially at the position of the b 0 NCD deletion and the flap domain (Figure 5(b)). ° Another rigid body refinement at 5 A resolution yielded the final model (Table 3). Although crystals of both eTaqRNAP and rTaqRNAP-d0 belonged to the same tetragonal space group (P41212), the rTaqRNAP-d0 had a significantly larger unit cell (Table 2), with an increase in the unit cell volume of about 18%. The larger unit cell, combined with the smaller molecular mass (332.3 kDa for rTaqRNAP-d0 versus 376.5 kDa for eTaqRNAP) gives the rTaqRNAP-d0 crystals a higher solvent content (eTaqRNAP crystals, 65%: rTaqRNAP-d0 crystals, 71%). The overall fold of rTaqRNAP-d0 remains the same as that of eTaqRNAP. Superimposition of the structures through the relatively immobile "core" module34 reveals a slight closing of the clamp domain in the rTaqRNAP-d0 structure compared with the eTaqRNAP. Through comparisons of different bacterial and eukaryotic RNAP crystal structures, the clamp module has already been characterized as a highly mobile structural element that can swing open and closed as much as

interact with sA under limiting conditions. Abortive initiation reactions (Figure 4) as well as native gel shift analyses (Supplementary Data, Figure S1) indicated that the rTaqRNAP-d0 was defective in interacting with sA. Since deletion of the entire b 0 NCD affected sA binding, we constructed plasmids that co-overexpressed rTaqRNAP harboring structure-based partial deletions of the b 0 NCD SBHM repeats, taking into account their interactions with sA.11 The first construct, rTaqRNAP-d1, lacked b 0 [209-389]. This deletion removed SBHM domains b, c, and d, leaving only SBHM domains a and e, the two SBHM repeats primarily involved in sA binding (Figure 2(b)).11 The second construct, rTaqRNAP-d2, lacked b 0 [216-340] and removed only SBHM repeats b and c, leaving all three SBHM repeats implicated in sA binding (repeats a, d, and e). All of the recombinant RNAP core enzymes (wt, d0, d1, and d2) had very similar specific activities on a primer-template substrate that does not require s for initiation (Materials and Methods and Supplementary Data, Figure S2). Abortive transcription assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of sA indicated that SBHM repeats a, d, and e were all necessary for efficient sA binding (Figure 4). Both the complete b 0 NCD deletion, rTaqRNAP-d0, and rTaqRNAP-d1 reached maximal activity (comparable to that seen with the wt-holoenzyme) only when a large excess of sA was added. In contrast, rTaqRNAP-d2, behaved similarly to rTaqRNAP, reaching maximal activity at much lower concentrations of sA (Figure 4). Native gel shift experiments followed the same trends (Supplementary Data, Figure S1), indicating that the rTaqRNAPd0 and -d1 RNAPs had a significant defect in binding sA, while rTaqRNAP-d2 was comparable to wtrTaqRNAP in its ability to interact with sA.

Figure 4. Abortive initiation with s titration. The indicated RNAP core enzymes were combined with increasing amounts of recombinant sA subunit, then abortive transcription initiation reaction from a T7 A1 promoter-containing DNA fragment was performed (initial transcribed sequence CAU) using the dinucleotide primer CpA with [a-32P]UTP substrate as described in Materials and Methods. The reaction products were resolved by denaturing PAGE and visualized and quantified by phosphorimager analysis. The numbers below each lane indicate the per cent activity (with the highest concentration of sA for each core enzyme taken as 100%).

208,5,12,35,36 augmenting or diminishing the RNAP ° active site channel by as much as 25 A. Some flexible loops located on the surface of the core enzyme adopt different conformations in the rTaqRNAP-d0 structure, primarily due to crystal packing contacts. Residues 762­786 of the b-flap domain,4 encompassing the loop and flap-tiphelix, show the most interesting rearrangement (Figure 6). In the eTaqRNAP, this structural element protrudes out from the structure, forming part of a wall that defines the RNA exit channel.37 In the rTaqRNAP-d0 structure, the loop and flaptip-helix folds in against the RNAP, capping off

and blocking the RNA exit channel. Interestingly, the end of the b flap adopts an intermediate conformation in the holoenzyme,33,34 in which the flap-tip-helix is bound by domain 4 of the s subunit. In both the endogenous and rTaqRNAPd0 crystals, the flap-tip is involved in crystal packing interactions (see below), so the functional significance of these observed conformations is unclear. Nevertheless, these observations serve to illustrate the range of conformations accessible to this important structural element, which is involved in critical functions of s-subunit binding33,34,38 and termination.39

Discussion
A recombinant system for preparing Taq core RNAP by co-overexpression of the individual subunits in Ec was generated.19 Reasonable yields of the in vivo assembled enzyme were obtained, which could be easily purified from the endogenous Ec enzyme and potential hybrid enzymes by heat treatment and affinity chromatography. The purified

In the lower right inset, an entire RNAP molecule is shown. The boxed region, focussing on the b-flap-tip, is magnified above and to the left. The position of the b-flaptip-helix from three different RNAP structures, illustrating the entire range of conformational flexibility that has been observed, are shown. The b-flap-tip rTaqRNAP-d0 structure is shown in blue. The b-flap-tip from the RNAP holoenzyme34 is shown in magenta (the s4 domain, bound to the b-flap-tip-helix of holoenzyme, is omitted). The b-flap-tip from eTaqRNAP4 is shown in red.

rTaqRNAP thus obtained was indistinguishable from the eTaqRNAP core in a number of biochemical assays.19 Unlike eTaqRNAP,4 however, the wt rTaqRNAP failed to crystallize. After ruling out differences in the preparation procedure (i.e. heat treatment) or the potential for trace amounts of hybrid enzymes as the problem, we hypothesized that some aspect of the folding of the rTaqRNAP subunits, or their assembly, was perturbed, such that the basic functions of the enzyme, as observed in in vitro assays, were not affected significantly. An obvious candidate was the Taqb 0 NCD, a 293 residue segment inserted between Taq b 0 conserved regions A and B (Figure 2). This domain is dispensable for the basic function of the core enzyme, since it is not found in most bacterial enzymes,30,31 including Ec b 0 . We engineered recombinant systems to express TaqRNAP with the Taqb 0 NCD completely deleted (rTaqRNAP-d0; Table 1) in the hopes of producing an enzyme better suited for crystallographic studies. A rapid, straightforward purification protocol was developed, combining a heat treatment step with two chromatographic steps (Figure 3(a)). The resulting recombinant deletion mutant of TaqRNAP yielded several crystal forms (Table 2), one currently suitable for structural studies (Table 3; Figure 5). The overall structure of the rTaqRNAP-d0 was the same as eTaqRNAP, indicating that the structural integrity of the RNAP was not perturbed by the genetic manipulations, co-expression and assembly in the heterologous Ec host, or by the purification and crystallization protocols. While the enzyme was active in a battery of functional transcriptional assays, we noticed it failed to bind efficiently to the s factor (Figure 4), providing biochemical evidence for previous proposals that the Thermus b 0 NCD plays an important role in s binding.11,33 We therefore engineered two more constructs harboring only partial deletions of the Taqb 0 NCD, rTaqRNAP-d1 and -d2 (Table 1; Figure 2), designed using the structure of the isolated Taqb 0 NCD.11 Both

118 of these partial Taqb 0 NCD deletions proved crystallizable (Table 2), and one of the partial deletions (rTaqRNAP-d2) restored nearly wt levels of s binding (Figure 4), indicating that structural studies of fully recombinant Taq holoenzyme should be possible. We believe that these results represent an important technical advance for structure/function studies of bacterial RNAP for two reasons: (1) Structural studies of bacterial RNAPs have been limited to the endogenous Thermus RNAPs laboriously isolated from large quantities of Thermus biomass. The new recombinant systems significantly facilitate the preparation of milligram quantities of RNAP required for structural studies. More importantly, procedures for the facile genetic manipulation of Thermus species have not been developed. The recombinant approach opens the way for genetic manipulation of bacterial RNAPs for structure/function analysis. This allows: (i) the deletion of non-essential domains or subunits to facilitate crystallization (as demonstrated here); (ii) structural analysis of deletion or point mutants to facilitate detailed structure/function analysis of enzyme

mechanisms and enzyme/drug interactions; and (iii) structure/function analysis of RNAPs from diverse bacterial species and even hybrid enzymes to investigate the role of species-specific domains in transcription regulation. (2) The genetic manipulations made possible by the recombinant system developed here can facilitate the formation of alternative crystal forms (alternative crystal packing arrangements). As expected from the different unit cell parameters and solvent contents (Table 2), the crystal packing interactions in the eTaqRNAP and rTaqRNAP-d0 crystals are very different. In the eTaqRNAP crystals, the intact b 0 NCD forms extensive packing interactions with neighboring symmetry-related molecules (Figure 7(a)). Another major packing interaction is a b-flap/b-flap interaction between neighboring, symmetryrelated molecules (Figure 7(a)). Alternatively, in the rTaqRNAP-d0 crystal, major packing interactions occur between the clamp modules of neighboring molecules (Figure 7(b)), and between the b 0 -jaw and other nearby structural elements of the b 0 subunit (Figure 7(b)). Crystallization in different crystal forms can increase the likelihood of obtaining crystals of specific

s subunit (or less, as indicated in the Figures) in 10 ml of transcription buffer (TB: 40 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.4), 40 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO4) for 10 min at 65 8C. Promotercontaining fragments were added to a final concentration of 100 nM and open promoter complexes were allowed to form during a 10 min incubation at 65 8C. Abortive transcription initiation reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 ml of hot mix containing 300 nM dinucleotide primer (CpA for T7 A1 or GalP1 promoters, GpC for the T7 A2 promoter), 0.5 mCi/ml [a-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/ mmol), and 15 mM UTP. Single-round run-off transcription reactions from T7 A1 were initiated by the addition of hot mix containing 30 nM CpApUpC, 0.5 mCi/ml [a-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 25 mM of ATP and GTP to obtain elongation complexes stalled at position C21. Both reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min at 65 8C. Stalled elongation complexes were chased by the addition of 250 mM NTPs for 5 min at 65 8C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of formamide-containing loading buffer. Products were analyzed by urea-PAGE electrophoresis (8 M urea, 10­20% (w/v) polyacrylamide), followed by phosphorimager analysis. Transcription reaction on single-stranded DNA was performed at the same general conditions used for transcription from double-stranded promoters but with a 66 nt long DNA fragment corresponding to the template strand of the T7 A1 promoter (5 mM) and 20 mM GACUCAUC primer. The reactions were incubated at 62 8C for 10 min, and then brought to room temperature. RNAP core was added to the primer-template complex and, after a 10 min incubation at room temperature, 5 mM [a-32P]GTP (300 Ci/mmol) was added. After a 15 min incubation, formamide-containing loading buffer was added. Products were separated by urea-PAGE electrophoresis (8 M urea, 20% polyacrylamide), followed by autoradiography. Large-scale expression and purification The plasmids producing rTaqRNAPs d0, d1 or d2 RNAP were transformed into Ec competent cells BL21(DE3) and colonies were directly harvested from the plates to inoculate 8 l of LB medium. The cultures were incubated for 20 h at 30 8C without IPTG induction. After centrifugation, cells from the 8 l culture were resuspended in 120 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM PMSF) and lysed using a French press. The total extract was then centrifuged for 50 min at 15,000g, and the resulting supernatant was loaded on a 15 ml Hitrap chelating column (Amersham Biotech) equilibrated with Ni2C. The column was washed with at least two volumes of lysis buffer with 20 mM imidazole, and the protein was eluted in five volumes of lysis buffer with 100 mM imidazole. Fractions containing RNAP were pooled and concentrated using a 15 ml, 10,000 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentration unit (VivaScience) to a final volume of 10 ml. The sample was then loaded on a Superdex 200 26/60 column (Amersham Biotech) and eluted with 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT. Typically, 8 l of Ec culture yielded about 15 mg of pure recombinant RNAP. The proteins could be stored at K80 8C with 15% glycerol. Crystallization and structure determination For crystallization experiments, the rTaqRNAP-d0 protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mM

functional states of the enzyme, which may not be suitable for crystallization in one specific crystal form due to conformational perturbations. In conclusion, we have developed a recombinant system for the preparation of Taq RNAP by cooverexpression and assembly in the heterologous Ec host, resulting in enzyme suitable for crystallographic studies. This opens the way for structural studies of genetically manipulated enzymes, allowing the preparation of more crystallizable enzymes, facilitating detailed structure/function analysis, and facilitating the preparation of alternative crystal forms. Characterization of the Taqb 0 NCD deletion mutants generated here showed that the b 0 NCD is important for the efficient binding of the s subunit, confirming previous hypotheses. Finally, preliminary structural analysis of one of the recombinant mutants revealed a previously unobserved conformation of the b-flap, further defining the range of conformations accessible to this flexible structural element.

Materials and Methods
Cloning The following multi-step procedure was used to create plasmid pET28rpoABHisCd0Taq, co-overproducing Taq a, b, and His-tagged b 0 lacking the NCD. To delete the region encoding the b 0 NCD between Arg159 and Asp451, two primers directed outside the fragment to be deleted were designed and used to amplify the flanking rpoC fragments by PCR (Supplementary Data, Figure S3). The non-mutagenic PCR primer used to amplify the rpoC fragment to the left of the deletion matched Taq rpoC positions 1­25 and contained an engineered NdeI site. The non-mutagenic primer used to amplify the rpoC fragment to the right of the deletion was complementary to Taq rpoC positions 1787­1812 and introduced and artificial HindIII site at position 1803. To allow the joining of amplified rpoC fragments flanking the deletion site, unique ClaI sites were incorporated in each of the primers used to create the deletion. The sequences of the primers are available from the authors upon request. The products of each PCR reaction were purified and blunt cloned into the pT7blue vector (Novagen). The NdeI-HindIII fragment containing deletion of the NCD coding region was assembled by cloning the NdeI-ClaI fragment from one plasmid into the appropriately treated plasmid harboring the ClaI-HindIII fragment. The mutant rpoC gene was next assembled by replacing the NdeI-HindIII of pT7blueTaqrpoC18 with the NdeI-HindIII-DNCD fragment, and the entire mutant gene was sequenced. Subsequent cloning steps leading to the construction of the overexpression plasmid pET28rpoABHisCd0Taq were analogous to those used to construct the fragment pET28TaqABC plasmid as described18 (Supplementary Data, Figure S4). An analagous procedure was used to construct the partial deletions of b 0 NCD (d1 and d2; Table 1). Transcription reactions In a standard transcription reaction, RNAP core (0.1 mg/ml) was pre-incubated with 0.025 mg/ml of the

120
Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT. The sample was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a 2 ml, 10,000 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentration unit (VivaScience). Initial crystals were observed within three to four days by vapor diffusion at 4 8C and 22 8C using the Hampton Research Natrix screen. The conditions were refined and crystals up to 0.7 mm! 0.4 mm!0.2 mm were obtained in hanging drops containing 1 ml of protein and 1 ml of crystallization solution (50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 1.0 M Li2SO4) at 22 8C. The crystals were frozen in liquid ethane in a cryo solution containing crystallization solution but ° with 2.5 M Li2SO4. A full dataset was collected to 4.1 A resolution at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X25 (Brookhaven, NY). The data were processed using HKL2000.40 The eTaqRNAP core structure,11 with the u subunit as well as the b 0 NCD removed, was used for molecular replacement with CNS.41 An initial ° rigid body refinement at 5 A (with rigid body groups defined as in supplemental Table 1 of Murakami et al.)34 followed by density modification using CNS (using all ° reflections to 4.1 A resolution), generated clear density. Structural modifications of loop regions clearly indicated by the 2jFojKjFcj map (Figure 5(b)) were made manually using the program O.42 A second rigid body refinement at ° 5 A resolution yielded the final model (Table 3).
