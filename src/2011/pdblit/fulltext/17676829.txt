We herein disclose a novel chemical series of benzimidazole-ureas as inhibitors of VEGFR-2 and TIE-2 kinase receptors, both of which are implicated in angiogenesis. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies elucidated a critical role for the N1 nitrogen of both the benzimidazole (segment E) and urea (segment B) moieties. The SAR results were also supported by the X-ray crystallographic elucidation of the role of the N1 nitrogen and the urea moiety when the benzimidazole-urea compounds were bound to the VEGFR-2 enzyme. The left side phenyl ring (segment A) occupies the backpocket where a 3-hydrophobic substituent was favored for TIE-2 activity.
Introduction Angiogenesis is the process of blood vessel sprouting, generating capillaries from existing vasculature. It occurs during tissue growth from embryonic development through to maturity, after which the process enters a period of relative quiescence during adulthood. Angiogenesis is also activated during wound healing and at certain stages of the female reproductive cycle. Pathological angiogenesis is involved with several disease states including various retinopathies, ischemic diseases, atherosclerosis, chronic inflammatory disorders, and cancer.1 In cancer, the growth of solid tumors has been shown to be angiogenesis-dependent. Consequently, manipulating the proangiogenic pathways is a strategy being widely pursued to provide new therapeutics in this area of unmet medical need. The role of tyrosine kinases in angiogenesis and in the vascularization of solid tumors has drawn considerable interest. Until recently, investigations in this area have focused on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its three receptors, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1), and VEGFR-3. The VEGFR family consists of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that catalyze the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in proteins.2 Of the three PTK receptors for VEGF involved in angiogenesis, VEGFR-2 has received the most attention to date. The kinase domain of this receptor functions by transferring a phosphate from ATP to the tyrosine residues, thus providing binding sites for signaling proteins downstream of VEGFR-2, leading ultimately to the initiation of angiogenesis.3 Indeed, a number of angiogenesis inhibitors involving inhibition of VEGFR-2 are currently in various stages of clinical studies.4 Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), a ligand for the endothelium-specific receptor tyrosine kinase TIE-2 (tyrosine kinase containing Ig and EGF homology domains), has been identified as a novel angiogenic factor.5 TIE is used to identify a class of receptor tyrosine kinases, which are exclusively expressed in vascular endothelial cells and early hemopoietic cells. Precedents exist in the literature for the development of TIE-2 inhibitors: a

pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine series of compounds was reported to inhibit TIE-2 and LCK,6 and a natural terpenoid from the plant Acacia aulacocarpa was reported to inhibit TIE-2.7 None of the compounds identified in these studies were found suitable for further development as potential drug candidates. Many researchers have been pursuing VEGFR-2 or TIE-2 kinase domain inhibitors to discover novel anti-angiogenic drugs. The growing interest in this strategy for cancer treatment stems from the envisioned favorable toxicity profile. Because VEGFR-2 and TIE-2 are located only in endothelial cells, an angiogenesis inhibitor would not be expected to affect normal proliferative cells, unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-2 play roles during the early stages of vascular development (namely, cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation), whereas Ang1 and its receptor TIE-2 function in the later stages of vascular development, such as vessel maturation and sprouting.8 Because VEGFR-2 and TIE-2 are involved in angiogenesis at different time points, we hypothesized that inhibiting VEGFR-2 and TIE-2 simultaneously would be even more effective than the inhibition of either one of these kinases. To our knowledge, there has only been a single report of a dual inhibitor of TIE-2/VEGFR-2.4f In this paper, we report the discovery of a novel class of potent low-molecularweight dual TIE-2/VEGFR-2 inhibitors. An initial high-throughput screening effort enabled us to identify a series of benzimidazole-urea compounds having dual inhibitory activity against TIE-2 and VEGFR-2. The prototypical compound 15, originally targeted as an anthelmintic agent,9 showed moderate VEGFR-2 and weak TIE-2 inhibitory activities. Several reports have previously described the activity of inhibitors having the diphenyl urea motif against such kinases as Raf, p38, and PDGFR.10 None, however, centered on the structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies for TIE-2 or VEGFR-2. Regan and co-workers10f elucidated the X-ray crystal structure of the binding mode of 55 (BIRB796) in p38R. The X-ray crystal structure suggested that the urea moiety of 55 forms hydrogen bonds with Phe168 and Glu70, two residues that did not interact with ATP. As depicted in Figure 1a, we surmised that the urea moiety of 15 might have a similar binding mode to that of 55 and decided to expand our understanding of the SAR of 15 based on this premise. We further hypothesised

Figure 1. (a) Binding hypothesis of 15 in VEGFR-2 based on the X-ray crystallographic complex of 55 and human p38R. (b) Compound 15 consists of several critical components and was divided into six segments (A-F) to facilitate the understanding of respective contributions to inhibitory potency at the target enzymes. Segment A, the backpocket region; segment B, the urea moiety that has hydrogen bonding interaction with Phe1407 and/or Glu885 of VEGFR-2; segment C, the inner hydrophobic region; segment D, the center linkage region; segment E, the scaffold and hinge-binding region; and segment F, the solvent front region.

a Reagents: (a) NaH, DMF; (b) Na S O or Pd-C, H , EtOH; (c) MeOC(O)NHC(SMe)NC(O)OMe (1,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea), 2 2 4 2 EtOH, HCl; (d) isocyanate (R-NCO), THF; (e) mCPBA, AcOH.

that the benzimidazole of 15 may position itself in the pocket, where the adenine of ATP is bound to the beta-strand of the target kinase. Chemistry To facilitate synthetic investigations and subsequent SAR analysis, we decided to divide 15 into six segments (see Figure 1b). To modify segment A, target compounds were prepared according to the synthesis shown in Scheme 1. In this scheme, the aryl group R is incorporated upon urea formation. 4-Acetamidophenol (X ) O) in DMF was reacted with 5-chloro-2-

nitroaniline in the presence of NaH to provide 5-(4-acetamidophenoxy)-2-nitroaniline (1c), the nitro group of which was reduced with Na2S2O4 to provide diamine 2c. Compound 2c was refluxed with 1,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea in ethanol, leading to an acetylated carbamate intermediate,11 which on deacetylation in HCl gave methyl (5(4-aminophenoxy)-1H-benzimidazol-2yl)carbamate (3c). This was then reacted with the appropriate phenyl isocyanate to give the target benzimidazoles 15-26. Diphenylthioether derivative 34 was obtained using a similar procedure. Subsequent oxidation with mCPBA led to 35 and 36, respectively. The 3-(arylurea)-

phenoxy derivative 30 was also synthesized according to the same procedure, using 3-acetamidophenol in the initial coupling. Scheme 2 depicts segment F modification. In contrast to Scheme 1, the left-hand side synthesis precedes the right-hand portion to introduce diverse functionality in segment F. 4-Aminophenol in DMF was treated with 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline in the presence of NaH to give 5-(4-aminophenoxy)-2-nitroaniline (4), which was coupled with 2-fluoro-5-trifluoromethylphenylisocyanate to provide 5a. Compound 5a was hydrogenated in the presence of Pd/C to give diamine 5b, which was reacted with cyanogen bromide to give benzimidazole 45. Condensation of 45 with the appropriate carboxylic acids in the presence of triethylamine, HBTU (O-benzotriazole-N,N,N,N-tetramethyluronium-hexafluoro-phosphate), and HOBt (N-hydroxybenzotriazole) gave amides 46-52. Reduction of 52 with lithium aluminum hydride gave 53. We wanted to understand the significance of the urea moiety for binding and thus decided to include the following modifica-

tions with regards to segment B. As shown in Scheme 3, we first synthesized benzylamide 28 using aniline 3c via treatment with 3-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid in the presence of HBTU. Thiourea 27 was obtained using 3-trifluoromethylphenylisothiocyanate, following a similar procedure used for the synthesis of urea analogues (e.g., Scheme 1). Reverse amide 29 was synthesized via a four-step sequence, as shown also in Scheme 3. Thus, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was first reacted with 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline in the presence of NaH to give 6a, which on coupling with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)aniline in the presence of HBTU, HOBt, and Et3N gave 6b. Reduction of the nitro group of 6b gave 6c, which was further reacted with 1,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea to give 29. Modification of segment C via incorporation of a pyridine ring was carried out as shown in Scheme 4. The synthesis of analogues 31 and 32 began with the coupling of 2-chloro-5nitropyridine with 2-nitro-4-hydroxyaniline. The product of this reaction was reduced via catalytic hydrogenation, resulting in

triamine 7b. Intermediate 7c was next obtained from 7b and, using procedures described previously, was converted to urea 31. The N-oxide derivative 32 was obtained via mCPBA oxidation of 31. 2-N-Acetyl-5-hydroxybenzimdazole was treated with 5-bromo2-nitropyridine in the presence of Cs2CO3, and the product of this reaction was hydrogenated over Pd-C to provide 7a. Coupling of 7a with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenylisocyanate led to urea 33.9 The synthesis of a carbonyl-linked analogue is depicted in Scheme 5. Friedel-Crafts condensation of 3,4-dinitrobenzoic acid with acetanilide was carried out in the presence of AlCl3 to give a biaryl ketone intermediate, which was reduced with zinc to give diamine 13a. Cyclization with 1,3-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea gave 13b. Benzophenone 37 was obtained following hydrolysis of 13b and coupling with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenylisocyanate,. In addition to the synthetic routes mentioned above, further modifications around segment B were also undertaken. Scheme 6 illustrates one such method. 2-Nitro-4-hydroxyaniline was reacted with 4-fluoronitrobenzene with NaH to give bisarylether 8a, followed by methylation to give 8b. Subsequent hydrogenation and cyclization with pseudothiourea derivative afforded 8c. This was followed by reaction with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isocyanate to give 39.

The N-methyl-6-phenoxybenzimidazole derivative 38 was synthesized as follows: N-methyl-5-chloro-2-nitroaniline (8d), derived from 2-nitro-5-chloroaniline, was reacted with 4-aminophenol to provide 8e. Following a procedure similar to that for the synthesis of 39, intermediate 8f was obtained, which was reacted with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isocyanate to afford 38. Benzthiazole and benzoxazole derivatives were prepared as follows (see Scheme 7). 4-(4-Nitrophenoxy)aniline (10), derived from 4-fluoronitrobenzene and 4-aminophenol, was cyclized with KSCN and Br2 in the presence of acid to provide thiazole 10a.12 Subsequent reaction with ClCO2Me gave 10d. Reduction with SnCl2 gave 10e, and finally, reaction with 2-fluoro-5(trifluoromethyl)phenyl isocyanate afforded 40. The corresponding sulfonamide derivative 54 was obtained by the coupling of ClSO2Me with intermediate 10a, using the same procedure. The benzoxazole derivative 41 was prepared as follows. 4-Aminophenol was coupled with 2-benzyloxy-4-fluoro-1-nitrobenzene to give ether 11, which was then treated with 2-fluoro-5(trifluoromethyl)phenylisocyanate to afford urea 12a. Hydrogenation with concurrent debenzylation and subsequent cyclization with BrCN gave 12b. This was followed by reaction with ClCO2Me to provide benzoxazole 41.13 A 4-aza-1,3-benzimidazole derivative was synthesized according to the procedure shown in Scheme 8. 2-Amino-6-chloro-

3-nitropyridine was coupled with 4-acetylaminophenol and K2CO3 to provide bisarylether 9a. Using methods similar to those shown in previous schemes, hydrogenation, cyclization, and hydrolysis provided 9b, which was then reacted with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenylisocyanate to yield 43. The

synthetic sequence leading to the 7-aza-1,3-benzimidazole derivative 44 is also shown in Scheme 8. Nitration of ethyl N-(5bromopyridin-3-yl)carbamate with fuming HNO3 was followed by hydrolysis to give pyridine 9c. Reaction with 4-Bocaminophenol gave 9d, which was then followed by the standard

hydrogenation, cyclization, and hydrolysis sequence to give aniline 9e. Reaction with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenylisocyanate yielded the 7-aza-1,3-benzimidazole derivative 44. The pyrrolo[2,3-a]pyridine derivative 42 was prepared as shown in Scheme 9. Bisarylether 9f, derived from 5-bromo-2nitroaniline, was cyclized with ClCH2CONHCO2Me. Hydrolysis of the resultant intermediate gave aniline 9g.14 Reaction with 2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenylisocyanate gave urea 42. Biological Results Baculovirus-expressed recombinant constructs of the intracellular domains of human TIE-2 tagged by GST WERE were used to assay TIE-2 enzyme inhibition (TIE-2 (E)). The protocol measured the ability of the purified enzyme to catalyze the transfer of the -phosphate from ATP onto tyrosine residues in a biotinylated synthetic peptide, D1-15 (biotin-C6-LEARLVAYEGWVAGKKKamide). Similarly, baculovirus expressed recombinant constructs of the intracellular domains of human VEGFR2 tagged by GST WERE were used to measure the ability of the purified enzyme to catalyze the transfer of the -phosphate from ATP onto tyrosine residues in a biotinylated

synthetic peptide, (biotin-aminohexyl-EEEEYFELVAKKKKNH2; VEGFR-2 (E)). The TIE-2 cellular autophosphorylation assay (TIE-2 (C)) used an ELISA method and a TIE-2 intracellular domain/c-fms extracellular domain (TIE-2/c-fms) chimeric protein expressed in mouse 3T3 cells. This assay measured the autophosphorylation level of TIE-2 protein expressed in cells. Segment A Modification: The assay results for segment A modified compounds are listed in Table 1. Compound 15, the prototypical compound, exhibited weak TIE-2 and moderate VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity. Introduction of a trifluoromethyl (CF3) substituent in the 3-position (16) resulted in a 600-fold increase in inhibitory activity against TIE-2 and an approximate 6-fold increase against VEGFR-2. A similar effect is observed with the ethyl analogue 19, the bromo analogue 20, and the chloro analogue 21. However, in the case of the ethyl analogue 19, there was a significant decline in cell potency. Potency against both TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 was little changed compared to compound 16 when a fluoro group (17) or a chloro group (18) were introduced at the 6-position. Introduction of a fluoro group to the 3-position (22) was less effective than Br, CF3, or

Cl, suggesting the importance of the substituent size. Hydrophilic substituents such as NH2 (25) or CO2H (26) resulted in inactive compounds. The trend in the SAR of the compounds with regard to TIE-2 inhibition was quite similar to that against VEGFR-2, although the compounds in question generally showed greater inhibitory potency against the TIE-2 enzyme. Cellular activity generally correlated well with enzyme activity, suggesting satisfactory cell membrane permeability properties for these compounds. Segment B Modification: For compounds where a variety of linker groups (segment B) were introduced, segment A was maintained either as the 6-fluoro-3-trifluoromethylphenyl or 3-trifluoromethylphenyl group. (Table 2). Replacement of the urea moiety with a thiourea resulted in 27, which was inactive against TIE-2 and showed greatly reduced activity against VEGFR-2. The acetamide linker compounds 27 and 28 also resulted in inactive compounds against the TIE-2 enzyme, although 29 did show good inhibitory potency against VEGFR2. Segment C Modification (Part A): Repositioning of the arylurea moiety from the 4-position of the phenoxy moiety to the 3-position gave 30, which retained considerable potency against both TIE-2 and VEGFR-2, in spite of the fact that such a rearrangement should significantly change the configuration (Table 3). Segment C Modification (Part B): When the phenyl moiety of 17 was replaced by a 2-pyridyl group, the activity against both enzymes and cell of the resultant 31 was slightly weakened, whereas the 3-pyridyl compound 33 maintained potency com-

parable to that shown by the phenyl analogue 17 (Table 4). The N-oxide 32 reduced both enzyme and cellular activities although the effect was more pronounced against VEGFR-2. This was also observed when the oxygen linker was replaced by a sulfoxide or sulfone (vide infra). Segment D Modification: The sulfur-linked compound 34 retained potency against both enzymes when compared with the oxygen-linked analogue 17, although cellular activity was considerably reduced. Sulfoxide and sulfone analogues, 35 and 36, respectively, showed a significant reduction in TIE-2 enzyme and cellular activity when compared with the sulfur analogue and were virtually inactive against VEGFR-2 (Table 5). As was seen with the comparison of TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 activities for the N-oxide analogue 32 described above, analogues 35 and 36 gave further indications that the region of the TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 enzymes where the sulfoxide and sulfone moieties project into show significant differences. A carbonyl linker such as in compound 37 also decreased the enzyme activity against VEGFR-2 and yet left the activity against TIE-2 virtually unchanged. Here, the less pronounced drop in activity against each enzyme could be explained by the fact that the carbonyl

An exception was 48, where the bulky ortho-substituent probably distorted the binding conformation of the molecule. Compound 52 containing a carbonyl moiety was hydrogenated to the piperazinoethyl derivative 53, which demonstrated weaker potency than 52 across the respective assay systems, indicating the potentially important role of the carbonyl group. Furthermore, conversion of the carbamate to a sulfonamide analogue (54) proved to be detrimental for TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity. Because the benzthiazole derivative 40 (Table 6) exhibited the same activity as that of 17, it is possible to conclude that the replacement of the carbonyl with SO2 was responsible for the loss of potency in this case. Structural Results and SAR Discussion We have described herein the modification of the benzimidazole-urea scaffold that resulted in a series of analogues exhibiting dual inhibitory activity against both TIE-2 and VEGFR-2. Furthermore, the TIE-2 enzyme activity of the analogues correlated well with their activity in the cell, suggesting the high cellular permeability of the compounds. Interestingly, the modification of this benzimidazole-urea series resulted in a much flatter structure-activity relationship profile for VEGFR-2 compared to TIE-2. The only exception observed was that VEGFR-2 activity was more susceptible to change in the structure of segment D (Table 5). Three critical elements for TIE-2 inhibitory activity were identified: the urea, the metahydrophobic substituent at the left-hand phenyl ring, and the proton-acceptor nitrogen confined in the [5+6] heterocyclic system. An X-ray crystal structure of VEGFR-2 with compound 17 bound at the ATP site was solved at a resolution of 2.05 Angstroms and has an R-factor of 18.7%, with a free-R of 23.1%. The crystal structure was deposited into the protein data bank (code number: 2OH4). Figure 2 illustrates the complex and shows that the urea is sandwiched between Asp1046 and Glu885 and that the nitrogen at the 1-position in the benzimidazole is bound in the hinge region. Asp1046 is considered to be a key part of the Asp-Phe-Gly motif at the end of the activation loop.10f This allowed for the hydrogen bond interactions of the two amide hydrogens with Glu885 and the carbonyl group with Asp1046. This might explain why the urea moiety was essential to observe potent inhibition of VEGFR-2, and such interactions may well be required for potency against TIE-2. This also might explain why replacement by methylene group resulted in inactive compounds (28 and 29) against VEGFR-2 (Table 2). The linker oxygen lay around Val916 and was found to act as a "linchpin" that dictated the angle between segments A-B-C and E-F, both of which were planar and inflexible. This binding mode may potentially rationalize the fact that the change of oxygen to a sulfone moiety abrogated the inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2 (36, Table 5). The fact that inhibitory activity was retained against TIE-2 implies that there are conformational differences between the two kinases around the area where the sulfone resided, thus creating an opportunity to exploit selectivity in the two enzymes. The nitrogen at the 1-position of the benzimidazole ring interacts with Cys919 at the ATP binding site, which supports the finding that N1-methylation was detrimental for activity, whereas N3-methylation was acceptable (Table 6). As long as the N-1 hydrogen bond acceptor was present, all the analogues containing the [6+5] heterocycles, including benzimidazoles, maintained strong potency against both enzymes. The only exception was compound 44, which still retained potency against VEGFR-2. The 1- and 7-nitrogen in the pyridine moiety of 44 when docked in a model was located near Ala905 in TIE-2,

moiety is not as large as the sulfoxide and sulfone moieties, thus, the resultant compound was unable to discriminate differences in the enzyme sites. Segment E Modification: Table 6 summarizes the results of the segment E [5+6] fused ring modification. The 3-Nmethylated derivative 38 still retained activity against both enzymes and in the cell, yet the 1-methylated analogue 39 abrogated the enzyme activity considerably, more so against TIE-2 than against VEGFR-2. Replacement of the nitrogen in the 3-position of the benzimidazole moiety by sulfur, oxygen, or a methylene group (such as 40-42) retained potency comparable to that of 17, suggesting that the nitrogen at the 3-position of the benzimidazole ring system might not be necessary for binding. Compounds 43 and 44 showed the impact of the position of the nitrogen in the imidazopyridine system on enzyme and cell activity. While compound 43 was active against both enzymes and in the cell, compound 44 was somewhat less active against TIE-2, both against the enzyme and in the cellular assay. Segment F Modification: Finally, the right terminus (segment F) was probed by introducing a variety of functionalities. The inhibitory activities of the resultant compounds are listed in Table 7. Overall, all modifications employed affected activity against both TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 quite evenly. Amides (4653) were generally found to show comparable activity to that of the parent carbamate 45, regardless of size and hydrophilicity.

was apparent that there was enough space that could accommodate a trifluoromethyl moiety surrounded by Val 899 and Cys1045 (Table 1). A representative compound 18 was administered orally to mouse (10 mg/kg) to show a moderate Cmax of 0.36 µg/mL at 2 h and a moderate AUC of 2.54 µg hr/mL, indicating that this urea-benzimidazole series can be employed as a systemically active drug. Overall, solubility of all analogues synthesized was poor despite the high cell activity. However, as described earlier, solubilizing functionalities could be attached off the benzimidazole region, which extended to the solvent front area without affecting enzyme and cell activities. For example, compound 52 (see Table 7) has good potency, with a solubility in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) of approximately 200 ug/mL. Conclusion A novel series of benzimidazole-ureas were found to inhibit both VEGFR-2 and TIE-2 kinases, each of which plays a major role in angiogenesis. The lead molecule 15 was divided into six segments and optimized accordingly. Structure-activity relationship studies elucidated a critical role of the N1 of the benzimidazole (segment E) and the urea moiety (segment B). This result was supported by the X-ray crystallographic elucidation of the complex of 17 in VEGFR-2 where the N1 and the urea moieties made key hydrogen bonding interactions with the enzyme. The left side phenyl ring (segment A) fits the backpocket where the 3-hydrophobic substituent was favored for the TIE-2 activity. The other side (segment E) is bent toward the solvent front where any substituent was tolerated insofar as the carbonyl moiety existed aligning with the exo-NH2 and the benzimidazole ring. The central linker proved to be the key part, interacting in the "hinge" region of the enzyme. Experimental Section
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE-400. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (ppm,  units). Coupling constants are in units of hertz (Hz). Splitting patterns describe apparent multiplicities and are designated as s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet-doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), quint (quintet), m (multiplet), brs (broad singlet), brd (broad doublet), and brdd (broad doublet-doublet). LC-MS analyses were performed with a Waters 2695 equipped with a diode array detector and ZQ2000 on a Waters XTerra MS C18 2.5 µm ( 2.1 × 20 mm) column eluted with a gradient mixture of H2O-acetonitrile with formic acid and ammonium acetate. All compounds analyzed were >90% pure.

corresponding to Cys919 in VEGFR-2, and yet there still is uncertainty how the difference affects the selectivity. Why the repositioned compound 30 retains the potency may be explained by the docked structure (Table 3). The rearrangement (1,4 to 1,3) would cause the benzimidazole to align the molecule favorably (Figure 3). The right terminus (segment F) extended to the solvent front region, giving consistent rationale that most of the analogues with appropriate substituents gave favorably inhibitory activity against both TIE-2 and VEGFR-2 (Table 7). Of high interest is that the left terminus (segment A) was predicted to penetrate through the Asp-Glu channel, extending to the backpocket. Although the model of the complex could not exactly explain how the 3-substituent in segment A played a pivotal role, it

Assay Conditions: The final assay conditions were 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% DMSO (when screening compounds), 200 µM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 50 µM sodium vanidate, 1 nM activated enzyme, and 200 µM peptide. IC50s of compounds were measured under subsaturating ATP (200 µM) and varying concentrations of activated TIE-2 and peptide substrate (RFWKYEFWROH; MW 1873 Da, TFA salt). Panvera antiphosphotyrosine antibody (cat. No. P2840) and PTK Green Tracer (cat. No. P2842) were used to detect the phosphorylated peptide. Polarization was measured on a TECAN Polarion in 138-second cycles for 30 min at room temperature. IC50s were then determined from the % polarization using normal calculation methods. Results are indicated below. VEGFR-2 Enzyme Assay (VEGF-E). The VEGF enzyme assay used the LANCE method (Wallac) and GST-VEGFR-2, baculovirus-expressed recombinant constructs of the intracellular domains of human TIE-2 tagged by GST. The method measured the ability of the purified enzymes to catalyze the transfer of the -phosphate from ATP onto tyrosine residues in a biotinylated synthetic peptide, (biotin-aminohexyl-EEEEYFELVAKKKK-NH2). This peptide phosphorylation was detected using the following procedure: GSTVEGFR-2 was incubated for 40-60 min at room temperature with 75 µM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and the test compound (diluted from a 10 mM stock in DMSO for desired concentration) in 100 mM HEPES buffer. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA (final concentration 50 mM). Streptavidin-linked APC (allophycocyanin, Molecular Probe) and Europium-labeled antiphosphorylated tyrosine antibody (Wallac) were then added at the final concentration of 15 nM and 1nM, respectively. The APC signal was measured using an ARVO multilabel counter (Wallac Berthold, Japan). The percent inhibition of activity was calculated relative to blank control wells. The concentration of test compound that inhibits 50% of activity (IC50) was interpolated using nonlinear regression (Levernberg-Marquardt) and the equation, y ) Vmax (1 - x/(K + x)) + Y2, where K was equal to the IC50. VEGFR-2 Crystallography. Protein expression, purification, and preparation of VEGFR-2 for crystallographic studies was carried out as described.15 A crystal structure of unliganded VEGFR-2 was solved using the Amore molecular replacement program using the FGF kinase as the model. Map generation and density modification were carried out using the CCP4 program suite.16 The structures were built using the program O17 and refined using the program CNX.18

Cocrystals were prepared by adding a 3-fold molar excess of ligand (50 mM in DMSO) to the protein for 1 h prior to the start of crystallization under conditions similar to those used to grow the unliganded crystals. The crystal structure of a VEGFR-2 complexed with ligand was solved in a similar fashion to the liganded structure, except the VEGFR-2 structure was used as the search model.
