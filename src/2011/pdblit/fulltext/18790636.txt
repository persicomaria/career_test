A series of 2-amino-pyrazolopyridines was designed and synthesized as Polo-like kinase (Plk) inhibitors based on a low micromolar hit. The SAR was developed to provide compounds exhibiting low nanomolar inhibitory activity of Plk1; the phenotype of treated cells is consistent with Plk1 inhibition. A co-crystal structure of one of these compounds with zPlk1 confirms an ATP-competitive binding mode. Ó 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Article history: Received 12 June 2008 Revised 25 August 2008 Accepted 26 August 2008 Available online 29 August 2008 Keywords: 2-Amino-pyrazolopyridine Polo-like kinase (Plk) SAR Kinase inhibitor

Polo-like kinases (Plks) belong to a highly conserved family of serine/threonine kinases that play critical roles during multiple stages of mitosis.1­3 Four Plks have been identified in mammals (Plk1­4), each containing an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal domain containing one or two highly conserved sequences called polo box domains (PBDs).1 The best-characterized human Plk is Plk1. Plk1 is expressed maximally during late G2 and M phases of the cell cycle and contributes to the regulation of centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation, and cytokinesis.1­4 Inhibition of Plk1 activity with small molecules leads to the formation of aberrant mitotic spindle poles, which in turn triggers the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), resulting in mitotic arrest and strong induction of apoptosis.1,5­7 Plk1 is overexpressed in a broad range of human tumors and this overexpression is positively correlated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many cancers.1,4,5 Plk1 is thus considered a good target for chemotherapeutic intervention.1,4,5 As part of our drug discovery efforts, we identified 2-aminopyrazolopyridine 1 as a moderate inhibitor of Plk1. In this communication, we describe the synthesis and structure­activity relationship (SAR) development of this novel chemical series, and present an X-ray crystal structure of a small-molecule inhibitor

in complex with the kinase domain of zebrafish Plk1 (zPlk1), a homolog that possesses a single conserved amino acid substitution (zPlk1 Ile118 = hPlk1 Leu132) for a residue lining the active site compared to human Plk1.16 The identification of 1 as a Plk1 inhibitor prompted further investigation into this class of compounds. A SAR study was initiated, with a particular focus on the phenyl group linked to the pyrazole nitrogen. Compounds 1­22 were synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Commercially available 2,4-dichloro-nicotinic acid methyl ester was first hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid and then converted to acyl chloride 2 by reaction with oxalyl chloride. Treatment of 2 with copper iodide and methyl lithium at low temperature yielded methyl ketone 3.8 Cyclization of 3 to pyrazole 4 was effected through treatment with hydrazine. Reaction of 4 with aryl halides in the presence of copper iodide, potassium carbonate, and N,N-dimethylglycine resulted in Narylation of the pyrazole ring.9 Standard Buchwald­Hartwig amination conditions provided the desired compounds 1 and 6­22.10 The SAR of these compounds is detailed in Table 1. Moving a methyl or fluoro group around the phenyl ring indicated that substitution at the 3-position is preferred. However, the electron-donating methoxy group is not well tolerated except in the 4-position. Further exploration of the 3-position confirmed the preference for relatively small electron withdrawing groups, with the 3-chloro (compound 15) being the most active as

compared with isopropyl, cyano, N,N-dimethylamino, or methyl sulfone groups. Compounds with 3,5-bis-substitution (20­22) also showed good activity, with bis-methyl compound 22 having 10fold better activity than compound 1. The observation that 3-chloro substitution on the right-hand phenyl ring provides an improvement in activity, and that 3,5bis-substitution is tolerated, led us to maintain 3-chloro substituTable 2 SAR for bis-substitution of phenyl ringa

tion while extending larger groups at the 5-position in an attempt to generate hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein's catalytic machinery. A selection of this expanded series of compounds is shown in Table 2, and their syntheses are depicted in Schemes 2­4. The bis-substituted phenyl compounds 28­30 were synthesized from intermediate 4 (Scheme 2). Copper-mediated arylation of 4 provided benzyl alcohol 23. Dess­Martin oxidation to 24 followed by condensation with the appropriate phosphonate gave the a,bunsaturated ester 25.11 Rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation provided intermediate 26. Amination conditions as described above generated compound 27, and TFA hydrolysis of the tert-butyl ester yielded compound 28. HATU-mediated amide bond formation yielded compounds 29 and 30. Tritylation of intermediate 4 followed by amination of the pyridine ring yielded 32 (Scheme 3). Subsequent detritylation to 33 and copper-mediated arylation with 1,3-dibromo-5-chlorobenzene provided compound 22 (an alternate synthesis to that shown in Scheme 1).9 Palladium-catalyzed Heck coupling with N,N-bisBoc-allylamine generated compound 34.12 Rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of the alkene followed by amino-deprotection yielded desired compound 36. Compounds 37 and 38 were synthesized from compound 22, which was derivatized through Suzuki couplings with aryl boronic acids (Scheme 4).13 Des-methyl compound 39 was synthesized in the same fashion, starting with 4,6-dichloropyridine-3carbaldehyde. As shown in Table 2, propionic acid 28 was highly active against the Plk1 enzyme (0.021 lM) as was propionic amide 29 (0.032 lM). The secondary amide 30 retains most of this activity, as does the propyl-amine 36. Rigidifying the alkyl chain with a phenyl ring also maintains activity, as long as the hydrogen-bond donor is in the proper position. For example, benzamide 38 provides 5-fold better enzymatic activity as compared to acetamide 37, which has a one atom shift in hydrogen-bond donor position.

Finally, removal of the methyl group on the pyrazole ring is tolerated with no loss of activity (compound 39). Several heterocyclic variations were explored, and it was found that a variety of substituted thiophene rings may be attached to the pyrazole 1-nitrogen with activity comparable to that of analogous phenyl compounds (data not shown). All other synthesized heterocyclic replacements for the phenyl ring were found to result in decreased activity.

Limited SAR studies were also performed on the left-hand amino group of compound 1 (data not shown). It was determined that neither the des-methyl-benzylamine nor the (R)-enantiomer of compound 1 retained any activity. Minimal substitution around the benzyl ring was tolerated, with most substitution resulting in loss of activity. While the (S)-a-methyl-benzyl amine could be exchanged for a variety of substituted anilines and result in comparable activity, no significant improvements were observed. Plk1 inhibition leads to a mitotic arrest and cell death, thus we tested the effects of inhibitors on cell cycle progression and viability in the HCT 116 colorectal cancer cell line. Mitotic arrest was determined as a doubling of DNA content (4 N) and increased levels of phospho-histone H3, a marker of productive entry into mitosis. Monastrol, an inhibitor of the mitotic kinesin Eg5 that causes cells to arrest in mitosis with monopolar spindles, was used as a reference. As shown in Figure 1, administration of monastrol or compound 39 resulted in comparable EC50 values for both mitotic endpoints (Fig. 1a). Fluorescence microscopy imaging of cells treated with either monastrol or 39 revealed that DNA was organized in aster-like morphologies characteristic of monopolar spindle and

mitotic arrest14 (Fig. 1c). Biochemical activity for 39 is greater than 50-fold selective for Plk1 over isoforms Plk2 and Plk3, and over 150-fold selective over the highly homologous kinase Aurora A (see Supplementary data, Table S1). To further support the conclusion that these responses are a result of Plk inhibition and not another mitotic regulator, we monitored phosphorylation of B23-nucleophosmin, a known substrate for Plk1.15 Western analysis of nocodazole-synchronized HeLa cells shows a marked decrease in B23 phosphorylation in 39-treated cells compared to monastrol-treated or control cells (Fig. 1b). Together, these data support a mechanism of action for these 2-amino-pyrazolopyridines as functioning through inhibition of cellular Plk1. As shown in Table 2, several of the more active analogs induce mitotic arrest with an EC50 less than 10 lM. These compounds also exhibit a cytotoxic effect, consistent with Plk1 inhibition, as demonstrated by comparable activities observed in an MTT assay (data not shown).

A co-crystal structure of 38 with zPlk1 further elucidates the SAR of this series (Fig. 2).16 The pyrazolopyridine ring is sandwiched between Phe169 (hPlk1 Phe183) at the bottom of the purine-binding pocket and Cys53 (hPlk1 Cys67) on the b4 strand in the back of the G-loop. The pyridine nitrogen forms a hydrogen-bond with the amide nitrogen of Cys119 (hPlk1 Cys133) (distance = 3.0 Å) located in the hinge region. Additionally, the proton of the pyrazolopyridine 2-amino group forms a direct hydrogenbonding interaction with the carbonyl of the same amino acid residue (distance = 2.7 Å). The interaction of 38 with the protein appears to be stabilized by the tight packing of the 3-chloro group against a hydrophobic pocket formed by the b-strands on each side of the G-loop and the side chain of the catalytic lysine 68 (hPlk1 Lys82) on the b5 strand. This interaction explains the SAR for this position as seen in Table 1. The observed water-mediated hydrogen-bonding interaction between the 2-benzamide nitrogen and Asp180 (hPlk1 Asp194) of the DFG-loop explains the SAR described in Table 2, where precise placement of a hydrogen-bond donor significantly improves inhibitory activity. Additional lipophilic interactions are observed between the terminal benzamide ring of 38 and the bottom of the purine pocket. Co-crystal structures of three additional analogs with zPlk1 were obtained, all demonstrating similar interactions (see Supplementary data, Fig. S1). In conclusion, we have disclosed a novel series of 2-amino-pyrazolopyridines that act as inhibitors of Plk1. Key SAR and binding elements have been identified, and initial hit 1 has been improved to achieve several compounds with Plk1 enzymatic activity <50 nM. Moreover, the primary mechanism of this series in cells has been shown to be that of Plk1 inhibition. Crystal structures of inhibitors in this series with zPlk1 have confirmed their binding mode and provided insight to inform future generations of Plk inhibitors.
