Carboxylesterases are ubiquitous enzymes with important physiological, industrial and medical applications such as synthesis and hydrolysis of stereo specific compounds, including the metabolic processing of drugs, and antimicrobial agents. Here, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of carboxylesterase from hyperthermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GsEst) for 10 ns each at five different temperatures namely at 300 K, 343 K, 373 K, 473 K and 500 K. Profiles of root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) identify thermostable and thermosensitive regions of GsEst. Unfolding of GsEst initiates at the thermosensitive -helices and proceeds to the thermostable -sheets. Five ion-pairs have been identified as critical ion-pairs for thermostability and are maintained stably throughout the higher temperature simulations. A detailed investigation of the active site residues of this enzyme suggests that the geometry of this site is well preserved up to 373 K. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds between Asp188 and His218 of the active site are stably maintained at higher temperatures imparting stability of this site. Radial distribution functions (RDFs) show similar pattern of solvent ordering and water penetration around active site residues up to 373 K. Principal component analysis suggests that the motion of the entire protein as well as the active site is similar at 300 K, 343 K and 373 K. Our study may help to identify the factors responsible for thermostability of GsEst that may endeavor to design enzymes with enhanced thermostability. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction Biomolecules isolated from thermophilic organisms provide numerous potential biotechnological advantages. Enzymes and proteins isolated from thermophilic microorganisms exhibit a high stability in conditions usually used for denaturing proteins such as high temperature, ionic strength, extreme pH values, elevated concentration of detergents and chaotropic agents [1,2]. As a result they can be used as biocatalysts under harsh environmental conditions [3]. In addition to the potential industrial applications, proteins and enzymes that are stable and active over 100  C represent good models to shed light on the molecular adaptation of life at high temperature [4,5]. Carboxylesterases are ubiquitous enzymes with important physiological, industrial and medical roles in the synthesis and hydrolysis of stereo specific compounds, including the metabolic processing of drugs, and antimicrobial agents [6­9]. Carboxylesterases (carboxylic ester hydrolase, EC 3.1.1.1) are members of the / hydrolase family. They hydrolyze short chain aliphatic

and aromatic esters and are inhibited by low concentrations of organophosphorus compounds [6]. The carboxylesterase gene has been isolated from gram-positive thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GsEst). This enzyme has been shown to have optimal activity for short chain acyl derivatives of length C4­C8 at a temperature of 70  C [9]. The crystallization of carboxylesterases of G. stearothermophilus has been performed at room temperature and the subsequent three-dimensional structure of GsEst has been elucidated (PDB code: 1TQH) [9]. GsEst containing 242 residues folds into two domains with the catalytic triad located at the interface between the domains. The smaller domain consists of three -helices B1 (residues 53­56), D1 (residues 119­137) and D2 (residues 141­151) that form a cap over the active site (Fig. 1) The larger domain resembles the classical / hydrolase fold. It contains a central seven-stranded -sheet surrounded by six -helices A (residues 25­36), B (residues 61­78), C (residues 90­99), D (residues 159­171), E (residues 195­202) and F (residues 226­239) (Fig. 1). The -sheet of the typical / hydrolase fold consists of eight strands with the second -stand antiparallel to the others. However, the first -stand of the typical / hydrolase fold is absent from this structure. Therefore, the -sheets of GsEst only have seven strands ( 2­ 8) with the N-terminal 2 strand antiparallel to the others. Besides, GsEst has two additional 310 -helices (residues 175­177 and residues 220­222).

and 500 K in order to explore the key factors governing thermostabilty of this enzyme. By calculating the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) values for backbone and C atoms, the thermal sensitive regions have been identified. Salt bridge interactions have also been analyzed. The dynamic properties of GsEst at different temperatures have been compared in terms of secondary structure content, molecular flexibility, intramolecular hydrogen bonds and protein­solvent interactions. Comparison of essential conformational subspaces of this protein at different temperatures has been monitored by principal component analysis. A detailed investigation of the residues of the catalytic triad has also been performed. 2. Methodology 2.1. Molecular dynamics simulation All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the GROMACS 3.3.1 [22,23] package and GROMOS96 [24] 43a1 force field implemented on a LINUX architecture. The starting configuration for hyperthermophilic carboxylesterase was obtained from G. stearothermophilus (PDB code: 1TQH [9]) which consisted of 242 residues. We abbreviated 1TQH as GsEst throughout the text. Crystallographic water molecules and heteroatoms were removed from the system. The starting structure was immersed in a triclinic box of SPC water molecules [25]. To neutralize the charge of the system 14 NA+ ions were added to each system. The resulting system sizes are listed in Table 1. Each system was subjected to energy minimization for 2000 steps by steepest descents. The minimized systems for GsEst were equilibrated for 100 ps each at five different temperatures namely 300 K, 343 K, 373 K, 473 K and 500 K by position restrained molecular dynamics simulation in order to relax the solvent. The equilibrated systems were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations for 10 ns each at five different temperatures. Periodic boundary conditions combined with minimum image convention were used under isothermal, isobaric conditions using Berendsen coupling algorithm [26] with relaxation times of 0.1 ps and 0.5 ps respectively. The LINCS algorithm [27] was used to constrain bond lengths using a time step of 2 fs for all calculations. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) [28,29] summation scheme. van der Waals and Coulomb interactions were truncated at 0.9 nm. The non-bonded pair list was updated every 10 steps and conformations were stored every 2 ps. Secondary structure analysis was performed using the program DSSP [30]. Other analyses were performed using scripts included with the Gromacs [31] distribution. The visual analysis of protein structures was carried out using Rasmol [32] and Pymol [33]. 2.2. Essential dynamics Essential degrees of freedom of GsEst were extracted from equilibrated portion of the trajectories according to principal component analysis (PCA) or essential dynamics (ED) method [34,35]. The ED method is based on the construction of the covariance matrix of the coordinate fluctuations. The covariance matrix is diagonalized to obtain the eigenvectors and

The relationship among rigidity, flexibility, thermostability, and activity has always been of fundamental interest for relating enzyme activity to enzyme stability. The most effective rational way to evaluate the factors governing thermostability of enzymes is molecular dynamics (MD) simulation [10]. Several MD simulation studies have been performed on thermophilic organisms, particularly focusing on the molecular strategies adopted by these enzymes and proteins to work in very harsh environment. For instance, using MD simulations the thermal stable mechanisms of rubredoxin [11], nuclease [12], barnase [13], nitrile hydratase [10], and adenylate kinase [14] have been studied. MD study has also been employed to study the dynamics of lipase [15], xylanase [16] dihydrofolate reductase [17], ribonuclease H1 [18] at high temperatures. So far MD simulation studies of psychrophilic esterase from Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis [19,20], hyperthermophilic esterase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus [3] and thermostable paranitrobenzyl esterase from Bacillus subtilis [21] have been reported. However, to date no molecular dynamics simulation study of any hyperthermophilic carboxylesterase has been reported in the literature. In this study MD simulations of GsEst have been carried out at five different temperatures namely 300 K, 343 K, 373 K, 473 K

The eigenvectors represent the directions of motion, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of motion along each eigenvector. The eigenvectors are then sorted according to their eigenvalues in descending order. Usually, the first 10­20 eigenvectors suffice to describe almost all conformational substates accessible to the protein, only C atoms were included in the definition of the covariance matrices for the enzyme.

The root-mean-square inner product (RMSIP) [36,37] was calculated to measure the degree of overlap between the conformational spaces of GsEst explored by the simulation at different temperatures. The RMSIP is defined as follows:

Sub-matrices of the overall covariance matrices that only involved segments surrounding the active site were also subjected to PCA and RMSIP analyses. The RMSIP was computed from the equilibrated portion of the trajectory. For diagonal elements, the RMSIP was computed by splitting the equilibrated portion of the trajectory into two equal halves. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Global structural stability In Fig. 2A, the backbone RMSDs of GsEst from the corresponding starting structure are shown as a function of time at five different temperatures. RMS deviations from initial structure are stable during the entire simulation at 300 K and 343 K and converged to values about 0.17 nm and 0.21 nm respectively showing a close resemblance to the starting structure. In the trajectory run at 373 K backbone RMSD of GsEst reaches equilibrium at about 2.5 ns and attains a value of 0.3 nm, RMSD remains the same afterwards for rest of the simulation. At 473 K and 500 K simulations, backbone RMSDs increase from the beginning of the simulation and attain a very high values of 0.6 nm and 1 nm respectively at the end of the simulation. Thus for GsEst, increasing temperature up to 373 K shows very little effect on the stability of its native structure. Significant structural distortions are observed only at higher temperatures. Radius of gyration (Rg) does not show significant change at different temperatures for GsEst (Table 2). Solvent accessible surface area (SASA) shows that no significant conformational change occurs during the simulations up to 373 K. At 473 K and 500 K, change of SASA is more pronounced. Rise of SASA is mostly contributed by the hydrophobic residues (Table 2). This is indicative of an increase in solvent penetration into the internal core of the protein. 3.2. Secondary structure Table 3 reports the average secondary structure content in GsEst at different temperature simulations, as well as in the corresponding starting structure according to DSSP classification. All the -sheets, -helices observed within the hydrolase fold of the crystal structure of GsEst are well maintained throughout the whole simulation period at 300 K, 343 K and 373 K. At higher temperatures (473 K and 500 K) -helices of the hydrolase fold gradually disorder accompanied by denaturation of original -sheets of the hydrolase fold. Therefore a significant decrease in -helix content is observed at higher temperatures. Unfolding process generates new sheets, originating from areas that were initially loops and helices, so altogether -sheet content does not alter significantly at higher temperatures. In general it has been observed that the sheets forming the core of the hydrolase fold are more stable than

-helices which encompass the core region. 310 -Helices are well maintained up to 343 K, only one 310 -helix (residues 173­175) is left at 373 K. Beyond 343 K simulation 310 -helices are not maintained at all. The starting structure of GsEst contains 227 intramolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bonds). The average number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds is calculated at different temperature simulations for GsEst (Table 2). The network of hydrogen bonds is well preserved at 300 K and 343 K. With increase in temperature, there is a concomitant decrease in number of hydrogen bonds holding the secondary structures together. Average numbers of protein­solvent interactions also decrease with rise in temperature. Effect of loss of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and protein­solvent interactions is more significant at higher temperature (473 K and 500 K) simulations (Table 2). 3.3. Structural flexibility The average RMSF values in the MD simulation are considered as the criterion for overall flexibility of the system. Fig. 2B compares the root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) of C atoms on a residue basis for every temperature simulations for GsEst. The RMSFs derived from the simulation at 300 K agree well with the atomic mobility of the crystal structures as derived from B-factors. At 300 K and 343 K, most regions of GsEst show slight fluctuation with increase in temperature, indicating protein is relatively thermostable at these temperatures. At 373 K residues of helices D1 , D2 and interconnecting loop (residues 129­158) show major RMSF fluctuation. In addition to these residues showing major fluctuations, loops between 3 and A (residues 20­24), 4 and B1 (residues 47­52), 7 and E (residues 186­202), and N-terminus and loop region connecting 8 and F (residues 217­226) show minor fluctuations. When the temperature is elevated much more (at 473 K and 500 K) most of the residues become highly mobile due to the loss of native secondary structure at high temperatures. At elevated temperatures, residues involving mainly helices of the hydrolase fold, 2, helices of the cap (1­10, 22­38, 50­80, 118­126, 132­155, 162­175, 189­202, and 216­233) show major fluctuation while the regions involving -sheets of the hydrolase fold (10­21, 39­53, 80­90, 104­114, 178­187 and 203­214) show less fluctuation at these temperatures. 3.4. Profile of salt bridge interaction Electrostatic interactions of ion-pairs in thermophilic enzyme may contribute to its increased stability at higher temperatures. Among many ion-pairs found in GsEst with 0.5 nm distance cutoff, only five ion-pairs are identified as critical ion-pairs for thermostability of GsEst. These ion-pairs are monitored throughout the simulation at all five temperatures. At 300 K and 343 K, ion-pairs Asp232­Lys211, Glu105­Lys82, Glu54­Lys134, Glu238­Arg12, Glu147­Lys134, and Glu147­Lys139 are well main-

strate binding pocket [20]. Stabilizing this region would be effective to improve the global thermal stability. 3.5. Catalytic triad In GsEst active site cleft is formed by six loops at the C-terminal ends of the predominantly parallel -strands. The catalytic triad consists of residues Ser89, Asp188 and His218. Ser89 of GsEst is located in the conserved sequence Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly. A network of hydrogen bonds stabilizes the catalytic triad. In fact, the wellknown mechanism of the catalytic triad requires the formation of an interaction between ND1 of His and the caboxylate moiety of Asp to ensure the right charge state of the imidazole ring: if this H-bond is not stable, the enzyme will be less active [20]. In the catalytic triad the OD1 and OD2 atoms of Asp188 of GsEst form bifurcated hydrogen bonds with the ND1 atom in His218. Ser89 forms hydrogen bond with side chain of His218. These hydrogen bonds involving the catalytic residues have been monitored throughout the simulations at five different temperatures. In GsEst Asp188 and His218 hydrogen bond is stably maintained even at very high temperature (up to 500 K). The hydrogen bond between Ser89 and side chain of His218 is maintained only up to 343 K. C ­C distances between the catalytic residues have also been monitored. The C ­C distance between the catalytic residues Asp188­His218, Ser89­Asp188 and His218­Ser89 of the crystal structure are 0.50 nm, 1.09 nm and 0.77 nm respectively. These distances are stably maintained up to 373 K simulation and the geometry of the catalytic site is well preserved up to this temperature. RMSFs of three catalytic residues namely Ser89, Asp188 and His218 show considerably higher flexibility at 343 K and 373 K than 300 K (Table 5). This observation suggests that the gain in flexibility of these residues might favor the entry of the substrates and/or catalysis [20]. Whereas at low temperature (300 K), the active site of the protein shows rigid conformation and the catalysis slows. Similar trend has also been observed for the segments of the substrate binding cap domain. Radial distribution function (RDF) allows us to obtain insights into the extent of water penetration and solvent ordering around

These two salt bridges include helices D1 and D2 of the cap region which has previously been identified by high RMSFs and is responsible for initial heat denaturation.

Correlated structure variation The overall concerted motions of GsEst at all five temperatures are investigated by the essential dynamics analysis. Table 6 reports the comparison of the essential subspaces of the proteins. We have calculated the root-mean-square inner product (RMSIP) between the first 10 eigenvectors of each simulation. This number accounts for the similarity/dissimilarity of the essential motions. For reference values, we have divided each trajectory in two halves and have calculated the inner product between the first 10 essential eigenvectors of each half. The values obtained represent the expected reference values that indicate a similarity in the motions and are taken as thresholds for a comparison among different trajectories. The results show that essential subspaces of the protein are significantly overlapped at 300 K, 343 K and 373 K. On the contrary, the motions of GsEst are significantly different when compared at higher simulated temperature. The fluctuations of C atoms of GsEst projected on first principal component at 300 K, 343 K, 373 K, 473 K and 500 K are shown in Fig. 5. The primary internal motion of the protein is similar to corresponding RMSF plots of C atoms shown in Fig. 2B. The overall flexibility of GsEst has been calculated by the traces of the diagonalized covariance matrix of the atomic posi-

tional fluctuations. We have obtained the following values for GsEst: 2.114 nm2 at 300 K, 4.337 nm2 at 343 K, 4.740 nm2 at 373 K, 38.778 nm2 at 473 K and 76.577 nm2 at 500 K. This result indicates that GsEst shows similar flexibility at 343 K and 373 K. Fig. 6 illustrates the motion along the first principal component (PC1) of GsEst at 300 K, 343 K and 373 K. PC1 accounts for 25% internal motion for GsEst at 300 K and 40% internal motion at 343 K and 373 K. For, GsEst, this mode mainly involves the correlated variations of the region encompassing helices of the cap domain and the loops connecting 8 and F, and 7 and E. The secondary structure components forming the core of GsEst are very rigid along this mode. However the rigidity of the core region loses to some extent at 373 K, at higher temperature loss is much severe. To analyze correlated variations localized within the active site, we have constructed covariance matrices including only regions

surrounding the active center (residues 87­91, 186­190, and 216­220) and calculated RMSIPs (Table 7). The resulting principal components have remarkable degrees of overlap with each other suggesting the essential subspaces of the catalytic site of the protein are largely overlapped up to 373 K. The degree of overlap decreases at higher temperatures (473 K onwards). Although the overlap values are higher than the overlap value obtained for the entire protein inflicting distortion of the active site of the enzyme is less compared to the entire protein at higher temperatures. The internal motion of three catalytic site residues has also been studied. We have found that internal motion of catalytic Ser89 is similar at 300 K, 343 K and 373 K. The relative direction of H218 and D188 of GsEst is also alike at these temperatures (Fig. 6). At higher temperatures (at 473 K), the motion as well as the relative positions of active site fragments are quite altered, the alteration becomes more pronounced at 500 K (figure not shown). 4. Conclusion In this study, MD simulations have been employed to study thermodynamic behavior of GsEst at different temperatures. At 300 K, 343 K, 373 K GsEst is stable and maintain its global three-dimensional structure throughout the simulation. Although the hydrogen bond between catalytic Ser89­His218 is impaired at 373 K the active site geometry remains unaltered up to this temperature as revealed by measuring C ­C distance between the catalytic residues (Asp188­His218, Ser89­Asp188 and His218­Ser89) throughout the simulation at 300 K, 343 K, 373 K. The internal motion of the catalytic site fragments is also similar at these temperatures. Five ion-pairs have been identified (D232­K211, E105­K82, E54­K134, E238­R12 and E147­K134) as critical ion-pairs. These ion-pairs are of fundamental importance in maintaining the structural integrity of the protein structure. Among these five pairs, one ion-pair (D232­K211) has been found to be extremely stable throughout the simulation up to 373 K. D232­K211 ion-pair between F and 8 adds more stability towards thermostable sheet core region. The overall flexibility of the entire protein calculated by the trace of the diagonalized covariance matrix displays similar flexibility of GsEst at 343 K and 373 K. This indicates that protein may have similar activities at these two temperatures. However based on RMSF calculations it has been found that certain regions of GsEst show higher flexibility namely D1 , D2 and interconnecting loop (residues 129­158) at 373 K. This may be due to the breakdown of Glu147­Lys139 ion-pair of the substrate binding cap domain. This is the most thermosensitive fragment of GsEst and denaturation initiates from this region. RMSFs of three catalytic residues namely Ser89, Asp188 and His218 show considerably higher flexibility at 343 K and 373 K than 300 K. This observation suggests that the gain in flexibility of these residues might favor the entry of the substrates and/or catalysis. Whereas at low temperature (300 K), the active site of the protein shows rigid conformation and the catalysis slows. Similar trend has
