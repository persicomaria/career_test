Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Tennis Court Road, Cambridge CB2 1QW, UK Cytochrome c6A is a unique dithio-cytochrome present in land plants and some green algae. Its sequence and occurrence in the thylakoid lumen suggest that it is derived from cytochrome c6, which functions in photosynthetic electron transfer between the cytochrome b6f complex and photosystem I. Its known properties, however, and a strong indication that the disulfide group is not purely structural, indicate that it has a different, unidentified function. To help in the elucidation of this function the crystal structure of cytochrome c6A from Arabidopsis thaliana has been determined in the two redox states of the heme group, at resolutions of 1.2 Å (ferric) and 1.4 Å (ferrous). These two structures were virtually identical, leading to the functionally important conclusion that the heme and disulfide groups do not communicate by conformational change. They also show, however, that electron transfer between the reduced disulfide and the heme is feasible. We therefore suggest that the role of cytochrome c6A is to use its disulfide group to oxidize dithiol/disulfide groups of other proteins of the thylakoid lumen, followed by internal electron transfer from the dithiol to the heme, and reoxidation of the heme by another thylakoid oxidant. Consistent with this model, we found a rapid electron transfer between ferro-cytochrome c6A and plastocyanin, with a second-order rate constant, k2 = 1.2 × 107 M-1s-1.

Introduction
Cytochrome c6 is a well-known class I cytochrome c.1 It has a central role in the intersystem electron transfer of many oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, transporting electrons between the cytochrome b6f complex and photosystem I. This role can also be fulfilled by the unrelated copper protein,

plastocyanin. Cytochrome c6 is widespread in cyanobacteria and algae, but has not been observed directly in chloroplasts from higher plants, whereas plastocyanin is universally present in plant chloroplasts as well as being common in cyanobacteria and algae. In organisms capable of synthesising both proteins, plastocyanin is the predominant product under most growth conditions, but is replaced by cytochrome c6 under copper deficient conditions.2,3 Cytochrome c6 is often considered to be the more primitive of the two, in view of the fact that iron would have been more readily available than copper under the reducing conditions of the early earth, but the situation would have reversed with increasing oxygen concentration in the atmosphere.2,4,5 Against this background, the recent discovery of sequences encoding a cytochrome c6-like protein in higher plants was surprising.

969 that it should be named cytochrome c6A, and this terminology will be adhered to in what follows. The aim of the work described here was to use the structure of the protein to suggest its possible modes of action. Modelling of the Arabidopsis sequence onto the known crystal structure of cytochrome c6 from the green alga Monoraphidium braunii has suggested that the backbone structures of the two proteins are very similar except for the insertion into the Arabidopsis protein of an extra 12 residues in a surface-exposed loop (the loop insertion peptide, or LIP).9,12 This loop, however, is likely to be the key functional feature of the protein, as the pair of cysteine residues in the LIP can form a disulfide bond in a manner that is unique amongst known cytochromes (see Discussion). Modelling of its structure is difficult, especially as there is no known similar sequence. A major objective of the structural studies described here, therefore, was to determine the structure of the LIP and its relation to that of the rest of the molecule. The modelling studies have suggested two possible modes of action of the protein.12 The first depends on the idea that the heme group could act as a direct sensor of the redox state of the intersystem electron transfer chain of the chloroplast, with reduction of the heme inducing a conformational change in cytochrome c6A. It is likely that this conformational change would involve the LIP since this is a conserved feature unique to all cytochromes c6A. The conformational change would influence the binding of the LIP to another thylakoid protein in such a way as to influence its activity. A second possibility, which would be favoured in the absence of conformational change, would involve intraprotein electron transfer between the two redox centres of cytochrome c6A, namely, the disulfide bridge of the LIP and the heme group. The reported midpoint redox potential for the heme group of cytochrome c6A is +140 mV,9 although we have recently determined a more accurate value of +94 mV (see Results). The redox potential of the dithiol/disulfide group of cytochrome c6A has not been measured; an expected value, based on the measured potentials of the cysteine/cystine system13 and of thioredoxin14 is approximately -300 mV. These values indicate that effective electron transfer could only take place in the direction of dithiol to heme. Such an electron transfer might, for example, be important in keeping dithiol/disulfide groups of thylakoid luminal proteins in the oxidized form. It then becomes necessary to identify the natural electron donor and acceptor molecules. Here we report the structure of cytochrome c6A determined by X-ray crystallography. We compare the structures in the ferric and ferrous states of the heme group, with the disulfide form of the protein used in both cases. In addition to helping to elucidate the questions raised above, the structure has enabled us to make a suggestion regarding the cause of the shift in redox potential of the heme between cytochrome c6 and cytochrome c6A. We have also

similarity to that of cytochrome c6, and provided evidence for its expression from databases of expressed sequence tags.6 The most obvious feature distinguishing the plant gene product from conventional algal and cyanobacterial cytochromes c6 was a 12-residue insertion, which was present in all the plant sequences studied and included two conserved cysteine residues. The presence of this insertion suggested that the protein might have a role in redox signalling and regulation. Gupta et al. independently discovered an Arabidopsis c6-like protein during a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with the chloroplast immunophilin FKBP13.7 They too noted the 12-residue insertion and suggested that the pair of cysteine residues might be concerned with the regulation of the protein. In addition they provided experimental evidence that the Arabidopsis protein might substitute for plastocyanin in the photosynthetic electron transport chain when plastocyanin was severely depleted by RNA interference; RNA interference in a knock-out mutant lacking the cytochrome c6-like protein was lethal. However, the conclusions of Gupta et al. have been challenged from two different approaches to the problem. Weigel et al. showed that inactivation of the two plastocyanin genes of Arabidopsis by stable frameshift mutations resulted in plants unable to grow photoautotrophically, even when the cytochrome c6-like protein was overexpressed at the same time.8 The approach taken by MolinaHeredia et al. was to examine the physical properties of the heterologously expressed protein. It was shown to be unable to donate electrons at a significant rate to photosystem I particles prepared from Arabidopsis.9 Moreover, its midpoint redox potential was found to be at least 200 mV lower than that of algal or cyanobacterial cytochrome c6, so rendering it an unsuitable electron acceptor from cytochrome f. These characteristics were not altered in a preparation of mutant protein in which the 12residue insertion had been deleted.10 Thus we conclude that the protein is unlikely to be involved in the normal electron transfer pathway of the chloroplast and that its true function remains to be discovered. An interesting development was the discovery that the recently sequenced genome of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii contains genes for both the well-known cytochrome c6 and the modified form found in Arabidopsis and at least some other higher plants.11 This provided strong support for the notion that the two forms of cytochrome c6 have different functions. It also prompted a phylogenetic analysis of all known cytochrome c6 sequences in comparison with those of other class I cytochromes c. The results confirmed that the Arabidopsis sequence arose out of the cytochrome c6 lineage, and the presence of a similar form in Chlamydomonas suggested that it first arose early in the development of plastids from their cyanobacterial precursor. In order to indicate that the Arabidopsis protein is structurally similar to, but functionally distinct from, cytochrome c6 we have proposed

970 examined the possibility that plastocyanin, a major redox protein of the thylakoid lumen, could act as an electron acceptor for ferrocytochrome c6A and show that this does indeed occur in vitro.

Results
Structure determination Crystals of the wild-type Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A were grown under a variety of conditions, but the cell dimensions of these crystals were large with a diffraction limit of 2.5 Å, and with potentially six molecules occupying the asymmetric unit. A number of Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A point mutants that had been designed for other studies were also used in crystallization trials. Of these, the double point mutant, I17A/G18A, crystallized in a much simpler cell and with greater crystalline order, and was pursued for structural analysis. These mutations have no effect on the redox potential of the cytochrome (we have obtained revised values, as described in Materials and Methods, of 94(±8) mV for wild type protein and 89(±5) mV for the mutant I17A/G18A), indicating that the structure is not perturbed significantly by the substitutions. Residues 17 and 18 form part of the heme-binding motif, CXXCH, where XX is Ala-Ala in cytochrome c6 from many species, but in cytochrome c6A it is Ile-Gly or Val-Gly in all higher-plant species examined and Ala-Gly in Chlamydomonas. The side-chains of these residues are on the surface of the molecule but it is not clear why the mutations change the molecular packing and improve the order of the lattice. The crystal structure was solved and refined for both the ferric and ferrous forms of the cytochrome at 1.2 and 1.4 Å, respectively, with excellent stereochemistry (Table 1). Structural features of ferri-cytochrome c6A Figure 1(a) shows the overall fold of the Arabidopsis ferri-cytochrome c6A. The structure is that of a typical class I c-type cytochrome, formed by four helices and a heme group. As expected from the sequence, the heme iron is coordinated by the sulfur atom of a conserved methionine (M60) on the distal side of the porphyrin ring, and by the N atom of a histidine side-chain (H20) on the proximal side. The orientation of the H20 imidazole group of the proximal histidine is fixed by a hydrogen bond interaction between the N atom and the main chain carbonyl group of G24 (Figure 1(b)). The porphyrin ring is covalently bound to the polypeptide chain via thio-ether linkages formed by the two vinyl groups of the porphyrin and the side-chain thiol groups of C16 and C19 (Figure 1(b)). The heme is buried inside a hydrophobic crevice with only one solventexposed edge, which involves the side-chains of pyrrole ring C and the propionate from pyrrole ring D. A characteristic of the higher plant cytochromes

is a well-conserved LIP that is absent in the bacterial and algal c6 homologues (Figure 1(c)). The crystal structure reveals that the LIP has a well-defined conformation and lies on the external surface of the cytochrome (pink colour in Figure 1(a)). The two conserved Cys residues in the LIP are linked by a conventional disulfide bond, highlighted in yellow in Figure 1(a). Determination of heme oxidation state in the crystal In order to compare structural differences between the two oxidation states of the heme in cytochrome c6A it is important to ascertain the redox state of the heme in the crystal prior to collection of diffraction data. This was done using a microspectrophotometer with the ultraviolet-visible spectra recorded at 100 K. The spectra in Figure 2 show typical spectroscopic signatures associated with the two heme oxidation states of cytochrome c6A. The presence of a band at 695 nm is a clear indication that the heme in the protein crystal was in the ferric state as this band arises from an Fe(III)-S(Met) charge transfer, which is absent in the spectrum of the ferrous crystal. Likewise, the presence of the distinctive  and -bands confirms the presence of a ferrous heme species in this crystal. A split -band is

porphyrin. For the ferrous spectrum a very broad Soret band at 416 nm is observed. This peak is not resolved in the spectrum of the ferric crystal due to absorption from the opaque specimen. Being confident that the prepared crystals respectively

(Figure 3(a)); thus, it is unlikely to serve as an external indicator to other molecules of the redox state of the heme. Electron transfer to plastocyanin Our alternative proposal for the mode of action of the protein is that it involves internal electron transfer from dithiol to heme, and thence to a generally available acceptor such as plastocyanin. To test the latter part of the hypothesis, we measured the second order rate constant k2 of the reaction between wild-type Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A and pea plastocyanin. The value obtained at 300 K and pH 6.0 was 1.2 × 107 M-1s-1 (Figure 4). This may be compared with k2 = 8.7 × 107 M-1s-1 for the reaction between plastocyanin and photosystem I from Arabidopsis.10 The latter is an essential step in the photosynthetic electron transport system and would therefore be expected to be very rapid, whereas the reaction between cytochrome c6A and plastocyanin is involved in the slower processes of biogenesis or regulation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Thus the observed value of k2 is consistent with a physiological role of electron transfer from cytochrome c6A to plastocyanin. It may be noted that the rate constant k2 is the bimolecular rate constant for the overall reaction between two proteins. It includes binding, first order electron transfer and dissociation, and is the physiologically relevant rate constant.

represent the ferric and ferrous heme states, we could compare the two structures and examine the differences in geometry. Structural comparison between the ferric and ferrous cytochrome c6A structures Figure 3 shows a comparison of the ferric and ferrous Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A structures. The conformational differences are extremely small. There are no significant changes in the polypeptide chain with a root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of C atoms of 0.09 Å (Figure 3(a)). Similarly, the configuration of the heme is almost unchanged (Figure 3(b)). There are no discernible movements of the axial heme ligands with the bond distances to the heme-iron remaining the same within experimental error. This contrasts with cytochrome c6 from the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus for which X-ray structures are also known for both heme oxidation states.15 Comparison of these structures revealed a significant rearrangement of both the heme-iron coordinating Met ligand and the neighbouring sidechain of a conserved Pro residue. A water molecule lies on the periphery of the heme pocket and forms hydrogen bonds with both of the propionate side-chains. The position of this water molecule remains constant in the two redox states of the heme. Remarkably, a water molecule in the corresponding position is also found in all bacterial cytochromes c6 structurally characterized to date. Given its proximity to the porphyrin and its polar nature, this water is likely to contribute to the adjustment of the redox potential in all of these proteins. As the structural changes in the heme geometry and environs are small, it seems that the factors that influence the redox potential in this cytochrome family are very subtle. We note in particular that the LIP assumes the same conformation in both redox states of the heme

Discussion

973 unlikely that the conformation of the bulk of the protein would be different in the dithiol form. Furthermore, we have established that the redox state of the heme does not affect the structure. Thus we can conclude that the disulfide/dithiol unit and the heme do not communicate by conformational changes of the protein. Cytochrome c6A seems to be unique amongst hemoproteins in having a partially exposed disulfide bridge on an exterior loop. Disulfides have been observed in other hemoproteins, but these are usually in the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Only a small number of cytochromes are known to contain single disulfide bonds. These include cytochrome c5 from Azotobacter,18 cytochrome c551 from Chlorobium limicola,19 cytochrome cL from Methylbacterium extorquens, 20 cytochrome b-558 from Ectothiorhodopsa vacuolata21 and cytochrome P450 BioI from Bacillus subtilis.22 The dimeric cytochrome c3 from Desulfovibrio gigas contains a pair of disulfide bridges linking the two subunits.23,24 In each case the disulfide bridge appears to play a structural rather than redox role. An interesting example of a redox protein with a single disulfide bridge is the quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase from Comamonas testosteroni.25 This is a two-domain protein with the disulfide bridge situated between the pyrroloquinoline quinone cofactor of one domain and the heme c of the other. These are separated by a distance of 12.9 Å and the disulfide forms part of the electronic bridge in a superexchange mechanism, rather than undergoing reduction and oxidation itself. A further feature of interest is the presence in Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A of an arginine residue at position 59 (Figure 1(c)). This is conserved in all the known plant sequences, although it is a lysine in C. reinhardtii. The arginine side-chain lies across the exposed edge of the heme. In cytochrome c6 of algae and cyanobacteria, on the other hand, the side-chain in the corresponding position is very small (Ala) or

that the structures of Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A and Monoraphidium cytochrome c6 are so similar. The exception is the presence of the LIP in cytochrome c6A, which has no counterpart in cytochrome c6. The backbone of Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A (LIP omitted) can be overlaid on that of Monoraphidium cytochrome c616 with an RMSD of 1.26 Å (Figure 5). The similarity of the heme environment is surprising in view of the marked difference in redox potential (see the discussion below). An even more striking redox potential shift (574 mV) occurs between cytochrome c6 and cytochrome c-549 (c-550) of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira maxima despite a similarity of structure that allows major portions of the backbones to be superimposed with an RMSD of 0.7 Å. 17 In this case, however, cytochrome c-549 has a histidine residue as the sixth ligand to the heme Fe, whereas both cytochromes c6 and c6A have methionine. The change in heme ligation would be expected to account for 150 mVof the downward shift of redox potential of cytochrome c-549. The LIP is well structured, with averaged temperature factors for the -carbon atoms of 19.3 and 17.9 Å2 for oxidized and reduced forms, respectively. Comparison between the structures of cytochromes c6A and c6 shows that the LIP can be regarded as originating from the replacement of a single residue of cytochrome c6 (Gly66 in Monoraphidium braunii; Asp68 in Chlamydomonas) by 13 residues, which include a central Gly residue (Figure 1(c)). The two Cys residues of the LIP form a disulfide bond, which is likely to be an important feature for function. Whether the structure of the LIP would change significantly on reduction to a dithiol is unknown. However, the fact that neither substitution of the two Cys residues by Ser, nor complete removal of the LIP by mutagenesis, has any effect on the redox potential and reactivity with photosystem I10 makes it

974 absent (Gly). The influence of the arginine on the reactivity of cytochrome c6A, for example with plastocyanin and photosystem I, is a matter for future investigation. Redox potential The marked downward shift of the midpoint redox potential, Em, of cytochrome c6A (90 mV) compared to cytochrome c6 (360 mV) is an important determinant of its function in vivo. We have looked for clues as to the structural origin of this difference by comparing the amino acid sequences of the two proteins. The most obvious difference is the possession of the LIP by cytochrome c6A, but mutagenesis experiments have shown that the LIP has little effect on the redox potential.10 A second difference with a high degree of consistency is the residue corresponding to position 52 in the Arabidopsis sequence. In cytochrome c 6A this is always (amongst known sequences) a hydrophobic residue, either valine or isoleucine. On the other hand, in 41 out of the 44 sequences for cytochrome c 6 in the Uniprot database this position is occupied by a glutamine. The existing X-ray structures of cytochrome c6 in the Protein Data Bank show this glutamine sidechain to be within hydrogen bonding distance of a water molecule, which in turn could hydrogen bond to one or both of the heme propionate side-chains. Loss of this interaction may well be an important factor leading to the lower Em in cytochrome c6A. The three exceptions mentioned above are interesting, but information concerning their redox potentials is lacking. In at least two of the cases (Anabaena sp. PCC 712026 and Synechococcus sp. WH810227) the organisms contain genes for two cytochromes c6, one coding for Ile and the other for Gln in the relevant position. One possibility is that the Gln protein functions in photosynthesis and the Ile protein in respiration, donating to cytochrome oxidase. Functional implications From the functional point of view the most important finding of the present investigation is that the structure of the protein changes scarcely at all as the heme group undergoes oxidation or reduction. Of the two possible modes of action described in Introduction, this finding makes it unlikely that the heme group acts as a sensor of the redox state of the cytochrome b6f complex, transmitting a signal to another protein via the LIP or another remote site. The role of disulfide groups in the regulation of plant metabolism has been thoroughly reviewed by Buchanan and Balmer.28 Cytochrome c6A, however, remains the only protein known so far that seems to demand an interaction between the disulfide group and a heme. We therefore consider the alternative possibility mentioned in Introduction, that the function of the protein depends on electron

transfer from the dithiol/disulfide group of the LIP to the heme. The distances between the S atoms of Cys67 or Cys73 and the heme iron are 12.2 and 13.3 Å, respectively, which would be compatible with efficient electron transfer if the distance is similar after reduction to the dithiol. Application of the Dutton equation29 suggests a rate constant of the order of k = 5 × 106 s-1 if one assumes a driving force G0 = -0.4 V and a reorganization energy of 1 V. In azurin electron transfer from a disulfide to the copper atom can be induced by pulse radiolysis over a distance of 26 Å with a rate constant k = 44 s-1.30 However, complete oxidation of the dithiol of cytochrome c6A of Arabidopsis to the disulfide is a two-equivalent process and would require two turnovers of the heme, with the first generating a thiyl radical as intermediate. As a result, the rate constant for the first step is likely to be several orders of magnitude slower than estimated above, although the second step would be correspondingly faster, once the heme had been reoxidized. This situation will be analysed in more detail elsewhere. A thiyl radical intermediate might be expected to react with oxygen, but in practice the reaction seems to be slow unless catalysed by Cu2+ ions.31 Thiyl radicals form essential intermediates in the mechanisms of action of ribonucleotide reductase32 and pyruvate-formate lyase.33 This interpretation of the function of cytochrome c6A emphasises the need to identify the natural electron acceptor for the heme in vivo. The finding that the cytochrome is oxidized rapidly by plastocyanin in vitro is therefore important (even though unphysiological electron transfer between redox proteins is well known), since they are expected to occur together within the thylakoid lumen. Even though cytochrome c6A cannot react directly with photosystem I, plastocyanin would, of course, provide a rapid route for its re-oxidation through the photosystem. Thus the properties of cytochrome c6A are consistent with the proposal that its function involves the ability to keep dithio-proteins of the thylakoid lumen (immunophilins,34 thioredoxins,35 Rieske iron-sulfur protein36 and the manganese stabilizing protein, PsbO37) in the oxidized, disulfide form. Gopalan et al. have recently shown that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of the luminal immunophilin FKBP13 is higher when its two disulfide groups are in the disulfide rather than dithiol form.38 They suggested the presence in the lumen of a redox protein that could catalyse the oxidation of dithiol groups by molecular oxygen. The results here suggest that cytochrome c6A could play this role. Although cytochrome c6A is autooxidizable, as would be expected from its low redox potential, the more effective oxidant of cytochrome c6A is photosystem I acting through plastocyanin. The final steps of such an electron transfer chain are well established. The first two steps, reduction of the disulfide bond of cytochrome c6A and electron

UV-visible spectroscopy of cytochrome c6A crystals was performed at the Cryobench laboratory at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) Grenoble, France. Spectra of loop-mounted cytochrome c6A crystals were obtained at 100 K on a microspectrophotometer operating between 850 and 200 nm.43 Final spectra were sample averaged 1000 times with integration times of 23 ms. Data collection and structure refinement A diffraction data set from an oxidized cytochrome c6A crystal was collected to 1.2 Å resolution at beamline ID 231, at the ESRF. The data were processed with Denzo and Scalepack.44 Crystals belonged to the space group P3221 with cell dimensions a = b = 58.21 Å, c = 64.76 Å. Matthews calculations predicted the asymmetric unit of the crystal to contain one molecule, with a solvent content of 57%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER.45 The structure of the Monoraphidium cytochrome c6 (PDB entry 1ctj) was used as a search model. The molecular replacement solution was found using a poly-alanine model, and the validity of the solution was shown by the unambiguous electron density for side-chains in the calculated maps. The positions of the Fe atoms were corroborated by anomalous Fourier from the calculated phases from the molecular replacement model. Refinement was initially performed with Refmac 5.46 The model was improved by automatic building of water molecules in ARP/WARP.47 Iterative cycles of model building with Coot48 and restrained refinement were performed. The final model contains one molecule in the asymmetric unit (residues 3 to 101). Data for the reduced state were collected on station ID29 at the ESRF to 1.4 Å resolution. Difference maps between the oxidized and reduced data, phased with the oxidized model, revealed small, distributed changes throughout the protein and greatest changes at the iron. The model for the oxidized form was therefore used as a starting model for solving the structure of the reduced state. Statistics from data processing and model refinement are shown in Table 1. Figures were prepared using Pymol49 and Espript.50 Redox potentiometry The same basic setup was used as by Schlarb-Ridley et al.51 However, the titrations were carried out at 298 K in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in the presence of the following redox mediators: 300 M potassium ferricyanide, 20 M diaminodurene, 20 M trimethylhydroquinone, 20 M hydroquinone. The titration was carried out by adding small aliquots of degassed ascorbate or dithionite solutions with a syringe through a septum. Oxygen exclusion was optimized by using freshly degassed buffer in a sealed cuvette under constant flow of argon. Tubing connecting the argon cylinder with the cuvette was copper apart from vacuum tubing at hinge regions. To remove any residual traces of oxygen, a control titration was carried out in the presence of 5 mM glucose, 52.8 units of glucose oxidase and 10.4 units of catalase.

Mutagenesis The double mutant I17A/G18A of the cytochrome c6A gene was generated by the Stratagene QuikChangeTM method,39 replacing the codons ATTGGT in the cytochrome c6A expression plasmid10 by GCGGCG. Incorporation of the correct mutations and absence of undesired changes were corroborated by sequencing of the mutated construct. Expression and purification Wild-type and the I17A/G18A mutant of cytochrome c6A were obtained from Escherichia coli GM119 transformed with both the respective expression plasmid10 and the plasmid harbouring the heme maturation cassette pEC86.40 Starter cultures (5 ml) were grown for 7 h at 37 °C/200 rpm in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/l) and chloramphenicol (22 mg/l) prior to dilution into 1.7 l of LB containing the same antibiotics and 1 mM FeCl3 in a 2 l Erlenmeyer flask. Cultures were grown for 84 h at 30 °C/170 rpm before protein was harvested by cold osmotic shock. Cytochrome c6A yields of about 15 mg/l were obtained in this manner. Proteins were purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration;41 for kinetic studies with plastocyanin, a chromatofocusing step was added. Protein concentrations were determined using 554.5 = 26,000 M-1 cm-1 for fully reduced protein.10 Pea plastocyanin was expressed and purified as described.42 Crystallization of Arabidopsis cytochrome c6A Crystals were prepared by the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method. The wild-type A. thaliana cytochrome c6A crystallized under a variety of conditions, but the cell dimensions of these crystals were large (P321, cell: a = b = 118.45 Å, and c = 81.50 Å). On the other hand the double mutant I17A/G18A crystallized in a simpler cell and the crystals diffracted to very high resolution. The protein was concentrated to approximately 0.87 mM in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.5), and mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution containing 1.26 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM acetate (pH 4.5) and 200 mM NaCl (Wizard I condition 30). This gave crystals of the oxidized form that diffracted to high resolution. For crystals of the reduced protein 0.1 M sodium ascorbate was added to the reservoir solution. However, crystals of the reduced protein diffracting to higher resolution were obtained in a second condition (Hampton Screen condition 48: 2.0 M ammonium phosphate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) plus 0.1 M ascorbate) to give the data set described in Table 1. Crystals appeared after approximately 24 h at 20 °C and reached final dimensions of 0.3 mm × 0.7 mm × 0.7 mm. Crystals were immersed in crystallization buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant, before freezing in a nitrogen stream at 100 K for data collection. Reduced crystals were immersed in cryoprotectant solution containing 0.1 M ascorbate for about 20 s before freezing.

out at 300 K in 10 mM potassium phosphate, 90 mM NaCl (pH 6.0) in an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SF.17MV), essentially as described.42 Absorbance changes due to oxidation of the heme were monitored at 418 nm. However, as cytochrome c6A autoxidizes within minutes, it was necessary to use the reduced cytochrome immediately after elution from a gel filtration column (GE Healthcare PD-10) to separate it from ascorbate, and use a freshly prepared sample for every other data point. Although the concentration of cytochrome c6A varied slightly between data points, it was always less than one tenth of the concentration of plastocyanin, so that pseudo-first-order conditions were maintained. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank as entries 2ce1 and r2ce1sf (reduced) and 2ce0 and r2ce0sf (oxidized). 11. 12.
