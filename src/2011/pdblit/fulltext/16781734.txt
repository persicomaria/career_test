Abstract Coulomb's law and a finite difference Poisson­Boltzmann based analysis are used to predict the pK values for 15 ionizable side chains (6 Asp, 6 Glu and 3 His) in ribonuclease T1. These predicted values are compared to the measured pK values to gain insight into the most important factors that influence the pK values of the ionizable groups in proteins. Charge­charge interactions are clearly the most important factor that determines the pK values of most ionizable groups in ribonuclease T1. However, pK values can be shifted by several pK units by the Born self energy associated with burying ionizable groups and by favorable intramolecular hydrogen bonding. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

ence Poisson­Boltzmann analysis to predict the pK values for the same residues. In some cases, the predicted values differ markedly from the measured values. We have predicted the same pK values using Coulomb's law and a finite difference Poisson­Boltzmann based approach using the University of Houston Brownian dynamics package (UHBD), another widely used method w4­6x. By comparing the results of these analyses, we are able to gain insight into the key factors that determine the pK values of the ionizable groups in RNase T1. Several other groups have considered this same question w6­16x.

a Except for Asp 76, the pK values were measured at 35 8C as described by Spitzner et al. w1x and given in Koumanov et al. w2x. The pK for Asp 76 was measured at 25 8C as described by Giletto and Pace w33x. b pK (CL) was calculated using Coulomb's law as described in the text. pK (UHBD) was calculated by a finite difference Poisson­Boltzmann based approach using the University of Houston Brownian dynamics package (UHBD). UHBD is described in w4­6x. pK (combined) was calculated using the charge­charge interaction term from Coulomb's law, DGij (CL), and the charge­ partial charge interaction term, DG(BG), and the Born term, DG(Born), from UHBD. In all cases, the coordinates are from the PDB structure 9RNT w18x and single charges were placed on the following atoms: Cg for Asp; Cd for Glu; C´1 for His; Nz for Lys; and Cz for Arg. c These are the pK values expected for these side chains in uncharged peptides w17x. d The first RMSD includes the results for Asp 76, and the term in parentheses does not.

2. Results The measured pK values for RNase T1 are given in Table 1 w1,2x. The pK values, calculated by three different methods, are also given in Table 1. The methods used to calculate the pK values are described next. In addition to the 15 measured pK values, RNase T1 contains 14 other ionizable groups (the N- and C-termini, 9 Tyr, 2 Lys and 1 Arg residues). We assumed the following pK values based on model compounds from Nozaki and Tanford w17xfor these residues: a-COOH (3.8), a-NHq (7.5), Tyr (9.6), 3 Lys (10.4) and Arg (12.0). We assume that the Tyr, Lys and Arg residues will not ionize in the pH range we are considering, -pH 9, for the 15 ionizable groups in Table 1. We use Coulomb's

law (CL): DGij(CL)s8j qiqj y ´r (1)

to sum up the charge­charge interactions at a pH equal to the pK of each ionizing group being considered and the rest of the charges on the protein. Since we are at the pK, we use a charge of y0.5 for the Asp or Glu residues under consideration and a charge of q0.5 for the pK calculation for the His residues. For the other residues, their measured pK is used to calculate their net charge at the pH being considered. The distance r between ° the two charges is calculated using the 1.5 A resolution crystal structure of RNase T1 determined by Martinez-Oyanedel et al. w18x (Table 1). (Pfeiffer et al. w19x have carefully compared this crystal structure with the solution structure deter-

mined by NMR.) For reasons explained below, a dielectric constant, ´s45, was chosen for all of the calculations. Fig. 1 shows plots of the pK (measured) values vs. the pK (calculated) values. Note that using ´s45 leads to slopes near one for all three of the plots. The pK (UHBD) values were calculated by a finite difference Poisson­Boltzmann based approach using the University of Houston Brownian Dynamics package (UHBD) w4­6x with the following adjustable parameters: ´proteins45; ´solvents75; Ts35 8C; ionic strengths20 mM; ° Stern Layers2.0 A; CHARMM 19 charge param° w20x; and probe radiuss1.4 A. The eter set; ´proteins45 value was chosen because it gave the lowest root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the pK (measured) and pK (UHBD) values. Most often, a value of ´proteins20 is used with this program w6,16x. With ´proteins20, the RMSDs0.89, which is considerably worse than the RMSDs0.78 when ´proteins45 is used (Table 1). The pK (CL) calculation takes into account only charge­charge interactions between the ionizable group and the other charged groups on the protein which we designate DGij(CL). The UHBD program takes into account three terms: DGisDGij(UHBD)qDG(BG)qDG(Born) (2)

where DGij(UHBD) is the charge­charge interaction term, DG(BG) is a summation of the interaction of the ionizable group with the partial charges of the polar groups in the protein and DG(Born) is the Born self energy of transferring a charge from the solvent to the protein. The CL calculation might be expected to model DGij better than UHBD because the actual pK values of the ionizable groups are used in the calculation. In UHBD, the calculated pK values are used to calculate the net charges. To test this, we combined the DGij term from the CL calculation with the DG(BG) and DG(Born) terms from UHBD calculation and this is denoted DG(combined) in Table 1. Note that the RMSD is considerably lower for the pK (combined) values than for the pK (CL) or pK (UHBD) values. 3. Discussion For all of the pK calculations, we begin with the pK of the ionizable group in an uncharged peptide. We have used the values from Nozaki and Tanford w17x that are most often used in trying to understand what determines the pK values of ionizable groups in folded proteins w6,7,11,21x. In Table 2, we give the difference between the measured pK values and the uncharged peptide pK values. Some of the pK values of the carboxyl

groups are raised and some are lowered, but all of the histidine pK values are raised. This is consistent with the net charge of the protein influencing the pK values since the pI of RNase T1 is f4 w22x. In the next column, we convert the DpK term to a free energy term, denoted DG, using the equation given in Table 2. The other DG terms in Table 2 are also given in terms of free energy. 3.1. Coulomb's Law The DGij(CL) term gives the energy required to place a charge of "0.5 on the ionizable group being considered at a pHspK of the ionizable group. In every case but one, when the DGij(CL) term is favorable, the pK is lowered and when it

is unfavorable, the pK is raised. (The outlier is Asp 29, which will be discussed below.) This is illustrated by the DpK and DGij(CL) values in Table 2 and is a reflection of the fact that charge­ charge interactions play the dominant role in determining the pK values of most ionizable groups. The DGij(CL) term takes into account the actual charge on each group and its distance from the ionizing group being considered. We can also look at the relationship between the pK (measured) values and the net charge on the protein which can be calculated from the pK (measured) values. The net charge of RNase T1 is plotted as a function of pH in Fig. 2a. Note that net charge depends sharply on pH near the pIf4 of RNase T1 where the carboxyl pK values are measured. In Fig. 2b,

Fig. 2. Shown are plots of the net charge of RNase T1 as a function of pH (a), pK (measured) as a function of the net charge of RNase T1 (b), and DpKspK (measured)ypK (model compound) as a function of the net charge of RNase T1 (c). The net charge was calculated from the measured pK values in Table 1 and the model compound pK values from Nozaki and Tanford w17x for the pKs not measured. If the data point for Asp 76 is removed, DpKsy0.18(net charge)­0.13 with Rs0.95.

the measured pK values are plotted as a function of the net charge, which ranges from q7 at the pK of Asp 76 to y8 near the pK values of the histidines. In Fig. 2c, the difference between the measured pK values and the pK values of model compounds is plotted as a function of the net charge. This again shows the importance of the net charge on the protein in determining the pK values. Since the net charge on a protein can be determined from a potentiometic titration curve, w23x it might be possible to estimate some of the pK values of the ionizable groups of the protein once the net charge is known as a function of pH. The discussion below will show when this approach is most likely to fail. We have used ´s45 in calculating the pK (CL) values. This is intermediate between the value for water at 35 8C, ´s75, and the values commonly assumed for proteins, ´s2­4 w24x. As often pointed out by the Warshel group, it is unrealistic to try and model the interior of a protein with a single dielectric constant w15x. They have also shown that the dielectric constant that is optimal for the Born self-energies is not optimal for charge­charge interactions w15x. However, using CL and ´s45, 10 of the 15 pK values are predicted to better than 0.5 pK units. (Those pK values that differ by more than 0.5 pK units will each be discussed below.) If we calculate the pK (CL) values with ´s75, the fit equivalent to Fig. 1a becomes ysy1.10q1.22x with Rs0.91 and RMSDs0.82. If we calculate the pK (CL) values with ´s20, the fit becomes ys1.79q0.60x with Rs0.92 and RMSDs1.31. Thus, the fit with ´s 45 is substantially better indicating that the average ´ modulating the electrostatic interactions among the ionizing groups is intermediate between the ´protein and ´solvent values, and this seems reasonable. Note that the pK values of Glu 28, Asp 29 and Glu 31 are all greater than the value expected based on model compounds. Residues 13 to 29 in RNase T1 form an a-helix and the ionizable groups of Lys 25, Glu 28, Asp 29 and Glu 31 are near the C-terminal end of the helix. The pH dependence of the interactions among these groups has been studied in the intact protein by Walter et al. w25x and in the isolated peptide by Myers et al.

probably shows that the DG(BG) term in UHBD is able to capture some of the effect of the helix dipole. Both Walter et al. w25x and Spitzner et al. w1x observed a complex titration behavior for Asp 29. The crystal structure of RNase T1 was determined at pH 7 w18x. In the crystal at pH 7, the side chain of Lys 25 is found in two conformations A and B, approximately equally populated. In A, the zN of the Lys forms a salt bridge with Glu 28 and in B it forms a salt bridge with Asp 29 (Fig. 3). The NMR structure suggests that the side chain of Lys 25 is flexible and adopts a number of conformations. Thus, it seems likely that as the pH is lowered these groups will rearrange to give the most favorable electrostatic interactions, and this makes it difficult to predict the pK values. The importance of rearrangements of the structure during titration has been emphasized by the Warshel group w15x and is probably the reason that it is difficult to predict pK values in a case like this where there are several ionizable groups in close proximity.

w26x. The agreement between the results for the peptide and the protein is remarkably good. Both studies show that the pK values of Glu 28 and Asp 29 are elevated in the folded protein and helical form of the peptide, suggesting this elevation of pK values results in part from an unfavorable interaction between these residues and the negative end of the helix dipole. To test this, we tried the CL calculation after adding a charge of q0.5 to the N of Ser 13 and y0.5 to the O of Asp 29 w27­31x. This improved the RMSD for all 15 ionizable groups from 0.72 to 0.68, and the pK (CL) values increased from 4.52 to 4.59 for Glu 28, from 3.57 to 3.82 for Asp 29 and from 4.55 to 4.77 for Glu 31. This shows that the helix dipole can significantly alter the pK values of ionizable groups in a protein. UHBD does better at predicting these pK values than CL which

3.2. UHBD In addition to the charge­charge interaction term, UHBD takes into account the Born self energy, DG(Born). The Born term is always positive because burying a charge is unfavorable. It will raise the pK values of carboxyl groups and lower the pK values of amino groups since the uncharged form is favored. The most buried ionizable residue is Asp 76 with DG(Born)s0.43 and the most exposed is Asp 49 with DG(Born)s 0.05. If the percent buried is plotted as a function of DG(Born), the correlation coefficient is 0.90, as expected. Both CL and UHBD predict a pK for Glu 58 that is much too low. The Born and charge­charge interaction terms for Glu 58 are large. DG(Born)s 0.44, and based on this value, a high pK would be expected. However, DGij(UHBD)s2.14 kcalymol, which more than overcomes the DG(Born) term and leads to a very low predicted pK. In contrast, CL predicts that the charge­charge interaction term to be 1.66 kcalymol. This value is smaller than the charge­charge term for UHBD, and since there is no Born term, the predicted pK is in better agreement with experiment. Glu 58 is at the active site of RNase T1 and forms a salt bridge with His 40. It is also quite close to the positive charges of His 92 and Arg 77. Thus, at its pK Glu 58 experiences a greater positive charge than all of the carboxyl groups except Asp 76 and Glu 82, although its pK is considerably higher. The NMR structures w19x suggest that this region of the molecule is also quite flexible. It seems likely that the structure will change as the pH is lowered and the groups titrate, so the structure near Glu 58 may be quite different at pHspKs3.93 than it is at pH 7. This is probably the reason that both CL and UHBD substantially underestimate the pK of Glu 58. McNutt et al. w32x have shown that the pK values of all three His residues in RNase T1 are lowered in a mutant where Glu 58 is replaced by Ala, confirming the importance of charge­ charge interactions in determining the pK values of these groups. UHBD also takes into account the interactions between the ionizing group and the partial charges of the polar groups in the protein, DG(BG). When

DG(BG) is negative, it will generally lower the pK values of carboxyl groups and raise the pK values of amino groups. The only ionizable group that forms three good intra-molecular hydrogen ° bonds (2.63, 2.69 and 2.89 A in length) and one good intermolecular hydrogen bond to Water 111 ° (2.66 A) is Asp 76 (Fig. 4), and it has the most negative value of DG(BG). Based on studies of the pH dependence of the stability of the wild type protein and the D76N mutant, this group has a pKs0.5 in the folded protein and a pKs3.7 in the unfolded protein w33x. This is remarkable since the side chain of Asp 76 is 99% buried and the ° distance to the nearest positive charges is 6.4 A to ° Arg 77 and 8.5 A to His 92. We think this is a good illustration of the suggestion of Warshel that often times ionizable groups can be solvated better in the interior of a protein than they can be hydrated by water w15x. Spitzner w1x and Koumanov w2x at first suggested that Asp 76 might have a high pK of approximately 6.5, but in a later paper they revised this down to a pKf2 w3x. The pK of Asp 76 is 3.5 pK units lower than expected based on model compounds (Table 1). The best calculated value in Table 1 is pK (combined)s2.13, which is 1.63 pK units too high. However, none of these calculations take into account Water 111 which forms a good (2.66 ° A) hydrogen bond to Asp 76 and has the lowest B factor of any water in the RNase T1 crystal structure w18,34,35x. If we include Water 111 in the UHBD calculations (TIP3P parameters for water) w36x, the DG(BG) term decreases from y1.22 to y1.62 and this lowers the predicted pK (UHBD) from 2.56 to 1.24. When these values are used in the calculations to give pK (combined), the pKs1.86 for Asp 76, and the RMSD for all 15 ionizable groups is lowered to 0.48. These results illustrate convincingly that intramolecular hydrogen bonds with other polar groups and intermolecular hydrogen bonds to water molecules can substantially lower the pK values of carboxyl groups in proteins. Several carboxyls have been shown to have pK values -2 in other proteins w37­40x but in most cases they are involved in salt bridges. Asp 76 in RNase T1 shows that buried carboxyl groups in proteins can have very

218

low pK values even when they do not form salt bridges. Note that all three of the histidine residues in RNase T1 have substantially elevated pK values (Table 1). This is in contrast to the basic protein staphylococcal nuclease (pI)10) where all four of His residues have depressed pK values ranging from 5.30 to 6.52 in the wild type protein w16x. The results in Table 2 show clearly why the pK values are elevated in RNase T1. Both the CL and UHBD calculations show that positive charges on His side chains have favorable interactions with the other charges on the protein, and this will increase their pK values. In addition, all three of His residues are hydrogen bonded, and this will also increase the pK values. In contrast, the three His side chains are all substantially buried and this would lower their pK values. In this case, the DGij(UHBD) and DG(BG) terms outweigh the DG(Born) term and this leads to the elevated pK values. 3.3. Concluding remarks In the microbial ribonuclease family, the pK values of the carboxyl groups range from 0.5 (Asp 76 in RNase T1) w33x to 7.4 (Asp 79 in RNase Sa) (Pace et al., unpublished results). The large difference between the values for the two Asp residues is especially interesting because both of the groups are almost completely buried. (Incidentally, when Val 66 in the hydrophobic core of staph nuclease is replaced with a Glu, the pKf8.8 w12x. This value appears to be the highest pK observed for a carboxyl group in a protein.) The high pK of Asp 79 in RNase Sa results because the unfavorable DG(Born) term is not compensated by favorable intramolecular hydrogen-bonding or charge­charge interactions. At the other extreme, the pK of Asp 76 in RNase T1 is low because the unfavorable DG(Born) term can be more than overcome by favorable hydrogen bonding and longer-range charge­charge interactions. The results in Table 2 show that in UHBD, the DGij(UHBD) term is generally larger than the DG(Born) and DG(BG) terms, especially when the pH being considered is not near the pI of the protein.
