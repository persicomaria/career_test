Prefoldin (PFD) is a heterohexameric molecular chaperone that is found in eukaryotic cytosol and archaea. PFD is composed of  and  subunits and forms a "jellyfish-like" structure. PFD binds and stabilizes nascent polypeptide chains and transfers them to group II chaperonins for completion of their folding. Recently, the whole genome of Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 was reported and shown to contain the genes of two  and two  subunits of PFD. The genome of Thermococcus strain KS-1 also possesses two sets of  (1 and 2) and  subunits (1 and 2) of PFD (TsPFD). However, the functions and roles of each of these PFD subunits have not been investigated in detail. Here, we report the crystal structure of the TsPFD 1 subunit at 1.9 Å resolution and its functional analysis. TsPFD 1 subunits form a tetramer with four coiled-coil tentacles resembling the jellyfish-like structure of heterohexameric PFD. The  hairpin linkers of 1 subunits assemble to form a  barrel "body" around a central fourfold axis. Size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light-scattering analyses show that the 1 subunits form a tetramer at pH 8.0 and a dimer of tetramers at pH 6.8. The tetrameric 1 subunits can protect against aggregation of relatively small proteins, insulin or lysozyme. The structural and biochemical analyses imply that PFD 1 subunits act as molecular chaperones in living cells of some archaea.

by preventing an unfolded protein from forming aggregates, or by providing a better environment for protein folding than the crowded cellular environment.1 Prefoldin (PFD) is one of the molecular chaperones forming a 90 kDa complex composed of two -type and four -type subunits.2-6 PFD is known also as a Gim complex, and is found in the archaeal and eukaryotic cytosol.2-4 Archaea normally encode one  and one  subunit, whereas eukaryotes possess six unique PFD subunit genes.4 The difference in the number of genes is considered to represent the difference of their substrate specificity.7 Archaeal PFD has been proposed to be involved in stabilizing a wide variety of unfolded proteins. In contrast, eukaryotic PFD is known to assist a restricted number of proteins, such as actin and tubulin.2,3 The variety of eukaryotic prefoldin subunits is considered to contribute to the substrate specificity.

466 eukaryotic PFD cooperate with type II chaperonin complexes, which are known as thermosomes in archaea, as well as chaperonin-containing TCP1 (CCT) and TCP-1 ring complex (TRiC) in eukaryotes.2,8 PFD binds and stabilizes nascent polypeptide chains and subsequently delivers them to the chaperonin for completion of the folding.9,10 The crystal structures of archaeal PFD from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (MtPFD) and Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhPFD) have been determined at 2.3 Å and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively.11,12 The overall structures of both PFDs are essentially the same. They show a "jellyfish-like" appearance composed of two  and four  PFD subunits. Coiled-coil  helices and two -barrels form the "tentacles" and the "body" of the jellyfish, respectively. Electron microscopy has revealed that the tentacles are flexible and catch the unfolded substrate protein in the cavity surrounded by the tentacles. 13 An electron microscope study of human PFD has shown it to utilize the same method to catch the nascent proteins.14 Although there is only one pair of  and  subunits in most archaea, as described above,4 a

recent genome analysis has revealed that the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis KOD1 has two pairs of prefoldin subunit genes (TK1005 and TK1121 for the  subunit, and TK0643 and TK1122 for the  subunit).15 The hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus strain KS-1 also possesses two  subunits (1 and 2) and two  subunits (1 and 2) of PFD (TsPFD).16 All four of the possible pairs of ­ complexes (1­1, 1­2, 2­1, and 2-2) appear to have chaperone activity in vitro.16 However, the functions and roles of each component have not been investigated in detail. We report here the crystal structure of the TsPFD 1 subunit at 1.9 Å resolution and its functional analysis. Only TsPFD 1 subunits form an assembly in the crystals, which were accidentally obtained during the trial for obtaining crystals of the 2­1 complex. The assembly of the 1 subunits without the 2 subunit represented the chaperone activity. We intended to obtain the crystal composed of the TsPFD 2­1 complex. The 2­1 complex was obtained by co-expression of the 2 and 1 subunits as described.16 The purified 2­1 complexes were

467 1 subunit, even though the 2­1 complex was used for crystallization. In order to confirm that the 1 subunit is the only component of the crystal, we prepared and analyzed crystals from the 1 subunit, which were grown under the same condition as those used for the copurified 2­1 complex. The space group and the cell constants of the crystals are identical with those obtained from the 2­1 complex. No essential difference was found in the electron density maps of these two crystals. These analyses indicate that the crystal from the 2­1 complex is composed of only the 1 subunit. One molecule of the TsPFD 1 subunit is present in an asymmetric unit of the crystal. Four molecules form a tetramer related by the crystallographic fourfold axis. The tetramer forms a jellyfish-like structure (Fig. 1a and b), which is similar to the structure of hexameric PhPFD and MtPFD. Four tentacles emanate from the body of the jellyfish, forming a cavity at their center. Each tentacle is approximately 70 Å long and consists of two coiledcoil anti-parallel  helices. The body of the jellyfish is formed by a -barrel structure composed of two  strands of each subunit. In total, eight strands from four subunits form the  barrel body.

eluted as a single peak at the same retention volume with PhPFD from a gel-filtration column, suggesting a heterohexameric structure (two 2 and four 1 subunits) like that of PhPFD.16 The 2­1 complex was subjected to crystallization in 25% (v/ v) 1,2-propanediol, phosphate-citrate buffer pH 4.2, 5% (w/v) PEG3000 and 5% (v/v) glycerol. The crystals belonged to the space group I422 with approximate unit cell dimensions of a = b = 71 Å, c = 114 Å. The SIRAS phased electron density map showed clear peaks corresponding to the 1 subunit, whereas the other component of the complex, the 2 subunit, was not observed. The refinement of the structure composed of only the 1 subunit reduced the crystallographic Rwork and Rfree factors to 17.7% and 19.7%, respectively (Table 1). These R-values are empirically low enough to complete the refinement, showing that the structure model of the 1 subunit might be a whole component of the crystal. In fact, no electron density was observed for the 2 subunit even at this stage. In addition, the Matthews coefficient VM and the solvent content17 were 2.7 Å3 Da-1 and 54.5%, respectively, showing that the existence of the 2 subunit would give unreasonable values. Thus, we conclude that the crystal contains only the

Notes to Table 1: Values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shells. The expression plasmid of the TsPFD 1 subunit was constructed as described.16 The plasmid was transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4600g for 15 min at 4 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and disrupted by sonication. The crude extract was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling on ice, and centrifuged at 25,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Toyoperl anion-exchange column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0 mM­500 mM NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing 1 subunits were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and then applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200-pg size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mM NaCl). Fractions containing 1 subunits were collected and then concentrated by ultrafiltration. A complex of the 2 subunit and the 1 subunit was over-expressed and purified as described.16 Initial crystallization was performed using the 2-1 complex at 18 °C by the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion method. Preliminary crystallization conditions were screened using commercial sparse matrix screen kits. A 1 l sample of protein solution and the same volume of the reservoir solution were mixed and incubated. Tetragonal bipyramidal crystals were grown with the precipitant solution containing 25% (v/v) 1,2-propanediol, phosphate-citrate buffer pH 4.2, 5% (v/v) PEG3000 and 5% (w/v) glycerol. Crystals appeared within three days and reached a size of about 0.2 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.15 mm within two weeks. The crystals were directly mounted on a cryo-loop and flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 95 K. Diffraction data sets were collected using an ADSC CCD detector at beamline BL41XU in SPring-8 and beamline NW12 in the Photon Factory Advanced Ring (PF-AR). Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000.23 Effective derivative crystals were prepared by soaking the native crystals in the reservoir solution containing 10 mM KAu(CN)2 for 26 h. Phases were determined by the single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method using the gold-derived crystals with the program SOLVE.24 The automated Patterson search of SOLVE identified one gold site in the asymmetric unit. This site was used to calculate initial phases. The resulting electron density map after the density modification using RESOLVE was readily interpretable.25 An automated model building was performed using ARP/wARP.26 The model building was continued manually using O27 and Coot.28 Refinement was carried out using CNS,29 with all data from 50 Å to 1.9 Å resolution, with the exception of 5% diffractions for the test set. The manual model building and refinement were conducted in several cycles. As described in the main text, the crystal was composed of only 1 subunits. The final model consisted of 114 residues (Met1­ Pro114) of the 1 subunit, one citrate ion, two glycerol molecules and 140 water molecules. The last three residues of the C terminus were disordered. The final model has reasonable stereochemistry, as verified with PROCHECK.30 The 1 subunit crystal was also prepared from the purified 1 subunit. The crystallization and data collection were performed using the same procedure with the crystal obtained from the co-purified 2-1 complex. The data were phased by the difference Fourier method using the refined crystal structure of the 1 subunit from the co-purified 2-1 complex. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of the 1 subunit have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 2ZQM.

The 1 tetramer forms a dimer of tetramers in the present crystal by the crystallographic twofold axis (Fig. 2a­c). A large cavity is formed inside the dimer of the tetramer. A coiled-coil tentacle of a tetramer interacts with only one tentacle from the other tetramer (Fig. 2a). A "cleft" is formed between the pairs of tentacles (Fig. 2b). The hydrophobic residues at the tips of the tentacles exist at this cleft and do not interact with any part of the surface area of the other 1 subunit. The pair of tentacles from two tetramers interacts with each other mainly by forming hydrogen bonds between their glutamines (Fig. 2d). A citrate molecule bridges two lysines at the interface of the two tentacles. Thus, the pairs of tentacles have no substantial interaction with each other. The monomer structure of 1 subunits is illustrated in Fig. 1c. The structure is divided into three regions, an N-terminal helix (a1), a  hairpin linker (b1 and b2), and a C-terminal helix (a2). The  hairpin linker contributes to formation of the

tetramer, as described above. The N- and C-terminal helices form an antiparallel  helical coiled-coil assembly. This coiled-coil assembly corresponds to the tentacle of the 1 subunit tetramer. These helices possess heptad amino acid repeats (Fig. 1d). Such repeats are widely found in the coiled-coil structures and are referred to as a knobs-into-holes arrangement.18,19 It is interesting that Met1­Ile4 forms a loop structure although the heptad repeats starts from Ile4 on the N-terminal helix. The corresponding residues of the -subunits of PhPFD and MtPFD are disordered in their crystal structures.11,12 The structure of the Met1­Ile4 loop of the 1 subunit is visible and could be one of the solution structures among prefoldins (Fig. 1d). In order to examine whether the 1 subunit assembly found in the crystal structure exists stably in solution, a size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light-scattering (SEC-MALS) molecular mass analysis and a chaperone activity assay were done with the purified 1 subunits. The SEC-MALS

analysis used a TSKgel G3000XL column (Tosoh) equilibrated with pH 6.8 buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl) and an OHpak SB-804 HQ column (Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with pH 8.0 buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl) connected with a multi-angle light-scattering detector (MINI DAWN; AWyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) and a differential refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101; Showa Denko) on an HPLC system, PU-980i (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). The 1 subunits were shown to form a 107.7 kDa assembly in pH 6.8 buffer, whereas a 54.7 kDa complex was ob-

served in pH 8.0 buffer. Since the molecular mass of the 1 subunit monomer is 13.2 kDa, the 1 subunits exist as an octamer at pH 6.8 in the phosphate buffer and as a tetramer at pH 8.0 in the Tris buffer. Next, we examined the molecular chaperone activity assay using citrate synthase (42.1 kDa), insulin (5.7 kDa) and lysozyme (14.7 kDa) as substrate proteins. Molecular chaperones protect the target proteins from aggregation. Thus, chaperone activity is estimated by measuring the aggregation of the substrate proteins under denaturing conditions.

Fig. 3. Chaperone activity of the 1 subunit and the 1­1 complex. Light-scattering at 500 nm was monitored to detect the aggregation of citrate synthase (CS), insulin and lysozyme. (a) CS (150 nM) incubated with the 1 subunit (100 nM, open triangle; 1 M, open circle; 20 M, open square), with the 1­1 complex (100 nM, filled square), or without any prefoldin components (filled circle) in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0 at 45 °C. The incubation temperature of 45 °C triggers the aggregation of CS. (b) Insulin (2 M) incubated with the 1 subunit (4 M, open triangle; 8 M, open circle), with the 1­1 complex (2 M, filled square), or without any prefoldin components (filled circle) in 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 45 °C. The high concentration of DTT and the incubation temperature (45 °C) initiate the aggregation. (c) Lysozyme (2 M) at pH 8.0 incubated with the 1 subunit (2 M, open triangle; 4 M, open circle; 6 M, open square), with the 1­1 complex (2 M, filled square), or without any prefoldin components (filled circle) in 20 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl at 25 °C. (d) Lysozyme (2 M) at pH 6.8 incubated with the 1 subunit (2 M, open triangle; 4 M, open circle; 6 M, open square), with the 1­1 complex (2 M, filled square), or without any prefoldin components (filled circle) in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl at 25 °C. The lysozyme used for c and d was denatured by 6 M guanidine HCl before the assays. The incubation buffers were preheated at the monitoring temperature and stirred continuously throughout the measurements for all assays. CS from porcine heart, insulin from bovine pancreas and lysozyme from chicken egg-white were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). Light-scattering was monitored using a spectrofluorimeter (FP-6500; JASCO).

At first, citrate synthase was used as a substrate, since it is the most commonly used substrate in molecular chaperone assays. The experiment was done at pH 8.0 in the Tris buffer, since the 1 complex should express chaperone function as a tetramer. The citrate synthase aggregated, and an increase of absorbance at 500 nm was observed at 45 °C (Fig. 3a). Although an equimolar amount of the 1­1 complex was able to suppress thermal aggregation of citrate synthase almost completely,

addition of an up to tenfold amount of 1 tetramer had only a marginal effect on the aggregation. Then, we used smaller substrates, insulin and lysozyme, since the substrate-binding site of the 1 tetramer is smaller than that of the ordinary prefoldin complex. The 1­1 complex could also suppress thermal aggregation of DTT-reduced insulin (Fig. 3b). The 1 tetramer also exhibited chaperone activity against insulin. Lysozyme denatured by 6 M guanidine HCl formed aggregates when diluted in the buffer

472 without guanidine HCl. Addition of the 1­1 complex to the dilution buffer prevented aggregate formation. The 1 complex was also effective in suppressing aggregation in the pH 8.0 Tris buffer (Fig. 3c). Almost the same amount of chaperone activity was observed in the phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 (data not shown). However, almost no chaperone activity was observed at pH 6.8 (Fig. 3d). Thus, we conclude that the 1 complex exists as a tetramer at higher pH and forms an octamer under acidic conditions. Prefoldin is known as a heterohexameric protein consisting of two  subunits and four  subunits, and the crystal structures of PhPFD and MtPFD revealed a heterohexameric assembly. However, the present SEC-MALS analysis and the crystal structure indicate that TsPFD 1 subunits assembled into a homo oligomeric tetramer. The crystal structure of TsPFD 1 subunits corresponds to that of MtPFD without its  subunits (Fig. 4a). The length of the whole structure of the 1 subunits was reduced to approximately 50 Å from the 70 Å of the MtPFD complex due to the loss of  subunits. The monomer structures of the TsPFD 1 subunit and the MtPFD  subunit are very similar to each other. The overall root-mean-square deviation between the TsPFD 1 subunit and the MtPFD  subunit calculated using the program LSQMAN20 is just 1.4 Å (92 atoms). However, the tips of the tentacles (N- and C-terminal sides of the coiled-coil helices) are not well superimposed (Fig. 4b). This is consistent with the fact that two different conformations exist in the asymmetric unit of MtPFD. The difference may be caused by the tight packing of TsPFD 1 subunits in the crystal and the flexible conformation on the tentacles. The flexibility of the conformation and the number of tentacles may contribute to accommodation of the various sizes of substrate proteins. Although the complex of the 2 and 1 subunits of TsPFD was crystallized, the crystal contained only the 1 subunits. The complex formation of 2 and 1 subunits was confirmed by gel-filtration before the crystallization setup. Several factors of the crystallization conditions, such as the high concentration of salt and/or low pH, may induce the disassociation of the complex. Recently, an electron microscopic study showed that the substrate-binding mode of PhPFD was changed depending on the size of the substrate protein.13 PhPFD utilizes only two  subunits of the 24 assembly to recognize a small unfolded substrate protein. The other four subunits (22) are not involved in the substrate recognition in this case. Biochemical studies of PFD have indicated that the hydrophobic residues at the tips of the  and  subunits are essential for binding nonnative substrate proteins.7,8 The hydrophobic residues are distributed on the inner-cavity surface of all  subunit, PhPFD and MtPFD structures (Fig. 4c).11,12 In this study, we showed that TsPFD 1 subunits work as a molecular chaperone against a small protein, insulin, but not against a relatively large protein, citrate

synthase (Fig. 3). The entire size of the TsPFD 1 subunits is smaller than that of the common hexameric (24) PFDs. TsPFD 1 subunits are considered to be able to accommodate the small substrate insulin, but not the large substrate citrate synthase. The size difference may lead to the different chaperone activities of 1 subunits against the two substrate proteins. It should be mentioned that the tetrameric TsPFD 1 subunits in the crystal could also be estimated as a dimer of the tetramers (an octamer). These two tetramers are related by the crystallographic twofold axis (Fig. 2a­c). The access to the cavity of each tetramer is blocked by the other tetramer. A similar interaction was not observed in the crystal structures of MtPFD and PhPFD. SEC-MALS analysis showed that 1 subunits formed an octamer under the acidic condition of the phosphate buffer. The chaperone assay using 1 subunits in this condition did not show anti-aggregation activity against either citrate synthase or insulin (data not shown). This result coincides with our expectation that the octamer of the 1 subunit is in an inactive state because the substrate-binding cavities of each 1 subunit tetramer are inaccessible. It was reported recently that several species have more than one gene of the PFD  subunit. The genome of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii encodes two  and one  PFD subunit homologues.4 One of the PFD  subunit homologues is up-regulated in response to heat stress. 21,22 The homologue forms a long filament by itself and does not assemble with either an additional  or  subunit. This homologue was classified as  PFD, and showed the molecular chaperone activity in vitro. The manner of assembly of the PFD  subunit was proposed to be the same as that of the assembly of its homologue, PFD  subunit.22 The manner of the  subunit association in the tetrameric assembly is also the same as that of the conventional hexameric structure. These homooligomeric associations of the  or  subunit could be predicted from its structures in the hexameric prefoldin. The homo oligomeric assemblies of the PFD  or  subunit may be one of the modes of prefoldin subunit assembly.
