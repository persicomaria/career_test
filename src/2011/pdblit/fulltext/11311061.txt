The synthesis, in vitro activities, and pharmacokinetics of a series of azepanone-based inhibitors of the cysteine protease cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38) are described. These compounds show improved configurational stability of the C-4 diastereomeric center relative to the previously published five- and six-membered ring ketone-based inhibitor series. Studies in this series have led to the identification of 20, a potent, selective inhibitor of human cathepsin K (Ki ) 0.16 nM) as well as 24, a potent inhibitor of both human (Ki ) 0.0048 nM) and rat (Ki,app ) 4.8 nM) cathepsin K. Small-molecule X-ray crystallographic analysis of 20 established the C-4 S stereochemistry as being critical for potent inhibition and that unbound 20 adopted the expected equatorial conformation for the C-4 substituent. Molecular modeling studies predicted the higher energy axial orientation at C-4 of 20 when bound within the active site of cathepsin K, a feature subsequently confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Pharmacokinetic studies in the rat show 20 to be 42% orally bioavailable. Comparison of the transport of the cyclic and acyclic analogues through CaCo-2 cells suggests that oral bioavailability of the acyclic derivatives is limited by a P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux mechanism. It is concluded that the introduction of a conformational constraint has served the dual purpose of increasing inhibitor potency by locking in a bioactive conformation as well as locking out available conformations which may serve as substrates for enzyme systems that limit oral bioavailability.
Introduction Cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38), a 24-kDa cysteine protease of the papain superfamily, has been shown to be selectively expressed within osteoclasts as a proenzyme.1 Upon activation, mature cathepsin K is secreted from the osteoclast into the acidic resorption lacuna where it plays a critical role in the degradation of the protein matrix of bone. Several studies have reinforced the role of cathepsin K in bone resorption and highlighted the attractiveness of this cysteine protease as a target for inhibition in diseases characterized by elevated levels of bone turnover such as osteoporosis.2-4 Recently the evolution of a variety of templates targeting the inhibition of cysteine proteases has begun

to expand.5 This expansion is based upon several studies which have shown that members of this class of protease are expressed selectively and that they play a critical role in the pathology of disease. The design and activity of a new class of reversible, 1,3-bis(acylamino)-2-propanone inhibitors of cathepsin K, exemplified by 1, have been reported (Figure 1).6 Despite potent inhibition of cathepsin K, the low oral bioavailability, short duration of action, and low potency in cell-based assays of bone resorption limited the utility of this class of compounds. Initial attempts to address these issues focused on the incorporation of peptidomimetic elements designed to reduce the peptide nature of 1. This has led to the discovery of compounds 2 and 3 which are potent inhibitors of human cathepsin K displaying potent inhibition in cell-based assays of bone resorption.7 However, because both 2 and 3 displayed poor oral bioavailability in the rat, their utility was limited to subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes of administration. A particularly successful modification of 1, involving the introduction of a conformational constraint, has led to the previously reported 3-amido-pyrrolidin-4-one 4 and the 4-amido-piperidin-3-one 5, both of which are potent, reversible inhibitors of cathepsin K.8,9 Several analogues within these cyclic 1,3-diaminoketone series displayed promising preliminary pharmacokinetics as

well as adequate potency versus rat cathepsin K.10 Due to rapid epimerization of the C-4 chiral center contained within these inhibitors, they were unsuitable for more detailed analyses of their pharmacokinetics in either rodents or primates. The rapid rate of epimerization of the C-4 diastereomeric center associated with these analogues represents a significant pharmacokinetic issue since it is difficult to determine whether the more potent of the two diastereomers has been absorbed and is actually present in the blood. The timelines of the analytical methods employed for the pharmacokinetic analysis of compounds is normally long relative to the epimerization rates of these inhibitors. On the other hand, inhibitor epimerization is of a time scale such that equilibration may not occur in blood prior to excretion. As such, the chiral instability present in the five- and six-membered ring cyclic diaminoketones would lead to racemization prior to serum analysis. The reality of this situation is fully recognized by the stereoselective oral bioavailability of the chirally stable azepanones described in this paper. The combination of potent enzyme inhibition and promising, but inconclusive, pharmacokinetics of the five- and six-membered ring diaminoketones prompted the investigation of several strategies designed to eliminate the epimerization of the labile C-4 chiral center of these analogues. Initial attempts to address this issue included blocking the offending epimerization by incorporation of a methyl group at C-4 or by elimination of the ketone moiety. Although both of these strategies produced compounds capable of inhibiting cathepsin K, their potencies were substantially reduced relative to the unsubstituted or ketone analogues.11 An ultimately successful approach to this epimerization issue was based on data which had shown that the rate of ketone enolization in the cyclic 1,3-diaminoketone series became slower as the heterocyclic ring was expanded from five to six members. Additionally, epimerization rates in the acyclic 1,3-diaminoketone series (see structure 2, Figure 1) had also been shown to be negligible. These data suggested that further ring expansion could slow the rate of ketone enolization to a degree sufficient to address the pharmacokinetic issues described above.

In this paper we describe a series of configurationally stable, azepanone-based inhibitors of human cathepsin K. Ring expansion of the five- and six-membered ring cyclic 1,3-diaminoketone templates to a seven-membered ring azepanone such as 6 (Figure 1) has proven to be highly effective in improving the C-4 chiral stability of these inhibitors. This modification has simultaneously provided compounds with improved oral bioavailability in rats. Additionally, incorporation of functional groups derived from structure-activity studies (SARs) in the acyclic 1,3-diaminoketone series into this azepanone template has led to the identification of 20, a potent, reversible inhibitor of human cathepsin K which displays good oral bioavailability in the rat, as well as inhibitor 24, a potent inhibitor of both human and rat cathepsin K. Synthesis Chemistry The syntheses of the azepanone and acyclic diaminoketone inhibitors described in this paper are detailed in Schemes 1-7. As shown in Scheme 1, N-alkylation of benzyl N-allylcarbamate (7)12 with 5-bromo-1-pentene in the presence of sodium hydride provided the olefin metathesis substrate 8. Treatment of diene 8 with catalytic bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)benzylidineruthenium(IV) dichloride according to the procedure developed by Grubbs and co-workers13 cleanly effected the ringclosing olefin metathesis to provide azepine 9. Epoxidation of 9 with m-CPBA provided oxirane 10 which was treated with sodium azide under standard conditions to cleanly afford azido alcohols 11 and 12 in a ratio of 9:1 (as determined by HPLC analysis) favoring the desired regioisomer 11. The regioselectivity of this epoxide opening is likely the result of the preferred chair conformation of 10 which places the bulky carbonylbenzyloxy nitrogen protecting group in a pseudo-axial orientation. This conformation effectively blocks the C-3 carbon leading to the preferred trans-diaxial nucleophilic opening of the epoxide at C-4.14 The undesired azido alcohol 12 was carried through the synthesis sequence and was removed at a later stage. Elaboration of the azepane core to 15 and 16 is outlined in Scheme 2. The mixture of azides 11 and 12 was reduced with 1,3-propanedithiol in methanol and

Hydrogenolysis of the benzyloxycarbonyl protecting group, followed by bis-acylation of the resulting 4-aminoazepan-3-ol (not shown) with 2 equiv of Cbzleucine in the presence of EDC, provided the diastereomeric mixture of alcohols 14. Oxidation of alcohols 14 followed by HPLC separation of the diastereomeric ketones provided azepanones 15 and 16. The syntheses of analogues 20 and 21 are detailed in Scheme 3. Acylation of amino alcohol 13 with N-Boc-Lleucine in the presence of EDC followed by hydrogenolysis of the carbonylbenzyloxy protecting group provided amine 17.

Application of the 2-pyridylsulfonamide moiety to the azepanone template had been derived from earlier work in the acyclic 1,3diaminoketone series where this functionality was shown to be a potency-enhancing, Cbz-leucine peptidomimetic. Oxidation of the mixture 18 with pyridine sulfur trioxide complex16 gave the mixture of diastereomeric ketones 19 which were separated by HPLC to provide azepanones 20 and 21. Diastereomer 21 could be recycled to 20 by epimerization with triethylamine in methanol and water followed by a second HPLC separation.

the C-4 chiral center as S (Figure 2). In this structure the azepanone ring is in a pseudo-boat conformation with the C-4 leucinamide group in an equatorial orientation. As outlined in Scheme 4, the synthesis of 24 and 25 began with acylation of amine 17 with 2-(3-pyridin-2ylphenyl)acetic acid17 in the presence of EDC. Removal of the tert-butoxycarbonyl protecting group followed by coupling of the resulting amine with 5-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethoxy]-2-benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid provided 22 as a mixture of two diastereomers. Oxidation of the mixture 22 gave azepanones 23 as a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers which were separated by HPLC to provide 24 and 25. Triethylamine-induced epimerization of 25 to the diastereomeric mixture of ketones 23 followed by a second HPLC separation allowed for a recycling of this less desired diastereomer. The syntheses of acyclic inhibitors 2, 28, and 36 are outlined in Schemes 5-7. As shown in Scheme 5, acylation of the commercially available 1,3-diamino2-hydroxypropane (26) with N-Boc-L-leucine in the presence of EDC followed by sulfonylation with 2-pyridinesulfonyl chloride provided the alcohol intermediate 27. Removal of the N-Boc protecting group and acylation of the resulting amine salt with benzofuran2-carboxylic acid and oxidation provided ketone inhibitor 28. Scheme 6 details the synthesis of inhibitor 2. Sulfonylation of the known amino alcohol 2918 with 2-py-

ridinesulfonyl chloride gave intermediate 30. Removal of the N-Boc protecting group followed by acylation with N-Boc-L-leucine, deprotection, and acylation with benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid gave intermediate 32 which was oxidized with the Dess-Martin periodinane to provide ketone 2. As shown in Scheme 7, treatment of the known epoxide 3319 with N-methylamine followed by sulfonylation with 2-pyridinesulfonyl chloride provided alcohol intermediate 34. Removal of the N-Boc protecting group and acylation of the subsequent amine salt with N-CbzL-leucine gave alcohol 35. Deprotection of 35 followed by acylation with benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid and oxidation provided ketone 36. Results and Discussion Potencies and Selectivities. Studies of cyclic fiveand six-membered ring ketone-derived cathepsin K inhibitors had highlighted the possibility of improved pharmacokinetics but had also shown that these ring systems were configurationally unstable at the C-4 diastereomeric center. As shown in Table 1, ring expansion to the azepanone 6 improved the stability of the C-4 chiral center to the point that separation of the individual diastereomers 15 and 16 was now possible. Azepanone 15 was shown to be a 2.0 nM inhibitor of cathepsin K, while diastereomer 16 was at least 7-fold less potent with a Ki,app ) 15 nM. Inhibitor 15 was selective for cathepsin K versus cathepsins L (Ki,app )

Azepanone 15 is 11-fold more potent than its acyclic counterpart 1 (cathepsin K Ki,app ) 22 nM) highlighting the utility of a conformational constraint in locking in a bioactive conformation of this inhibitor.20 Having established both the viability of the ring expansion concept for the potent inhibition of cathepsin K as well as the improved chiral stability of the C-4 diastereomeric center, this class of sevenmembered ketones became the focus of a medicinal chemistry effort to optimize selectivity and oral bioavailability. Functional groups which had displayed potent inhibition of human and rat cathepsin K and had led to effective inhibition of native cathepsin K in celland tissue-based in vitro assays systems in the acyclic

1,3-diaminopropanone series were applied to this azepanone template. As shown in Table 1, the incorporation of the 2-pyridinesulfonamide group, which had been shown in the acyclic 1,3-diaminopropanone series to be an effective potency-enhancing replacement for the Cbz-leucine moiety, combined with replacement of the carbonylbenzyloxy group with the benzofuran-2-carboxamide, provided 20 which is a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin K with a Ki ) 0.16 nM. Analogue 20 is 13-fold selective for cathepsin K versus cathepsin L, 25-fold selective versus cathepsin S, and greater than 3000-fold selective versus cathepsin B. The C-4 R diastereomer 21 was approximately 1/6000th as active as 20 with a Ki,app ) 980 nM, highlighting the critical nature of this center

for potent inhibition of cathepsin K. (We are unable to exclude the possibility that even this low level of activity may be the result of contamination (<0.01%) by 20.) The mixture of diastereomeric alcohols 18 was not active when tested up to a concentration of 1 µM. The incorporation of a conformational constraint has increased the inhibitor potency of 20 at least 10-fold relative to acyclic analogues 28, 2, and 36 which are 1.6, 7.5, and 670 nM inhibitors of cathepsin K, respectively. Compound 20 has been characterized as a competitive, reversible inhibitor of cathepsin K. As shown in Figure 3 the Lineweaver-Burk plot of 20 displays a 1/v axis intercept which is constant with increasing inhibitor concentration, indicative of competitive inhibition.

tion observed over a 30-min period. The reversible nature of inhibition of 20 was established by mass spectral analysis which showed that upon incubation of 20 with cathepsin K for 2 h there had been no irreversible modification of the protein by the inhibitor. Incubation of 20 with excess cysteine in D2O/DMSO followed by 1H NMR analysis showed 20 to be stable to

epimerization. Within the level of detection at 500 MHz, this experiment also showed no hemithioketal formation highlighting the unreactive nature of the azepanone carbonyl moiety. Azepanone 20 is a potent inhibitor of native cathepsin K in an in vitro, cell-based assay of bone resorption21 (IC50 ) 70 nM) as well as a potent inhibitor in an in situ cytochemical assay (IC50 ) 80 nM) which measures cathepsin activity in osteoclasts in sections of human tissue.22 An HPLC method allowing for the baseline separation of 1:1 diastereomeric mixtures of azepanones was developed in order to more precisely elucidate the rate of epimerization of the C-4 chiral center of this class of compound. Under acidic to neutral pH conditions (pH 2-7 phosphate buffer) the C-4 centers of the diastereomeric pair 20 and 21 were each stable in aqueous buffer for days with no detectable change by HPLC analysis. At pH > 12 these compounds epimerized rapidly to reach a 1:1 ratio within a few hours. Similar behaviors were observed for azepanones 24 and 25 and for the acyclic derivative 2. To further elucidate the mechanism of enolization, kinetic studies in pH 11 and 12.5 buffers, in which the epimerization could be monitored in a reasonable experimental time frame, were carried out on 20, 21, and their corresponding 2,2,4-trideuterated analogues 37 and 38.23 The firstorder rate constants of epimerization are shown in Table 2. A deuterium isotope effect of approximately 5 was observed for the deuterated derivatives 37 and 38. The rate of epimerization increases with pH at about a 10fold increase per pH unit. The kinetic result is consistent with a hypothesized mechanism of base-catalyzed formation of the achiral enol intermediate leading to racemization of the C-4 chiral center of 20 as well as 21. By extrapolation, epimers 20 and 21 would have a half-life of approximately 1 year in pH 7.4 buffer. We understand the faster rate of enol formation in the fiveand six-membered ring ketones compared to the seven-

membered ring ketones to be the result of the elimination of eclipsing interactions within these ring systems upon enol formation. For the conformationally more flexible seven-membered ring ketone system, enol formation results in greater ring strain thereby leading to a higher energy transition state. As a 60 nM inhibitor of rat cathepsin K, 20 is approximately 375-fold less potent an inhibitor of this enzyme than of human cathepsin K. The characterization of both cynomolgus monkey24 and rat25 cathepsin K have recently been reported from these laboratories. These studies have shown that mature cathepsin K from cynomolgus monkey is identical to the mature human enzyme. This has permitted the in vivo evaluation of potent inhibitors of human cathepsin K, such as 20, to determine their ability to inhibit bone resorption in a recently developed medically ovariectomized monkey model of bone turnover. In this model, 20 significantly inhibited bone resorption with once daily subcutaneous dosing at 12 mg/kg as measured by the decrease of the serum bone markers NTx and CTx.26 Alternatively, mature rat cathepsin K has been shown to be 88% identical to the human enzyme.25 Despite the relatively high sequence identity of the rat and human enzymes, their kinetic behavior toward the fluorogenic substrate Cbz-Leu-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin varies considerably (human cathepsin K Km ) 6 µM; rat cathepsin K Km ) 99 µM) with a kcat/Km 12-35-fold lower for the rat versus the human enzyme. This difference in substrate specificities is also reflected in the significant difference in the potencies of inhibitors such as 20 against the human and rat enzymes. This has precluded the evaluation of many potent inhibitors of human cathepsin K in standard rodent models of bone turnover.7 Furthermore, this difference has necessitated the development of separate SARs in order to identify suitably potent inhibitors of rat cathepsin K for evaluation in these models. Azepanone 24 was identified as an exceptionally potent inhibitor of human cathepsin K (Ki ) 0.0048 nM) and a sufficiently potent inhibitor of rat cathepsin K to permit in vivo evaluation (Ki,app ) 4.8 nM). The incorporation of the 2-(3-pyridin-2-ylphenyl)acetamide as well as the 5-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethoxy]-2-benzofuran2-carboxamide was derived from earlier work in the acyclic 1,3-diaminopropanone series which had shown these functional groups to be favorable for potent inhibition of rat cathepsin K. The potency of 24 versus rat cathepsin K has afforded the opportunity to examine the ability of this inhibitor to attenuate bone resorption in the thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX) rat as well as bone loss in the ovariectomized (OVX) rat. Continuous intravenous infusion of 24 reduced PTH-induced hypercalcemia in the TPTX rat in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 24 also inhibited bone matrix degradation in the ovariectomized rat.27 Analogue 24 is selective for human cathepsin K versus human cathepsins B, L, and S with Ki,app ) 100, 0.49, and 14 nM, respectively. As with inhibitor 20, compound 24 has been characterized as a competitive, reversible inhibitor of cathepsin K. Azepanone 24 is a potent inhibitor of native cathepsin K in the osteoclastmediated bone resorption assay (IC50 ) 30 nM) and in the in situ cytochemical assay, a measure of osteoclast

cathepsin activity (IC50 ) 30 nM). Diastereomer 25 is approximately 1/1000th as potent as 24 versus human cathepsin K with a Ki,app ) 4.7 nM. The precursor, twocomponent mixture of trans diastereomeric alcohols, 22 inhibited cathepsin K with a Ki,app ) 54 nM confirming the importance of thiol addition to the ketone of the inhibitor as a critical component to the very high potency of 24. The potency of alcohols 22 is likely the result of the excellent noncovalent interactions at P3, P2, and P3 of the inhibitor with critical residues within the active site of the enzyme. In addition, the expected active isomer of alcohols 22 with the S configuration at C-4 of the azepanone ring when presenting the amino group as axial would position the C-3 hydroxyl group also in an axial orientation. This relationship has the potential to place the C-3 hydroxyl moiety in the same position as the hydroxyl group of the hemithioketal of the bound 24 (vide infra). The only difference between the ketone and the alcohol would then be the lack of a covalent bond and the possible introduction of nonbonded sulfur-CH interactions accounting for the 3 orders of magnitude loss of potency between 24 and 22. Molecular Modeling and X-ray Crystallography. 1. Predicted Structure of 20 Bound to Cathepsin K. On the basis of conformational analysis of both diastereomers of the representative model hemithioketal 3928 (see also Experimental Section), we developed a representative set of seven azepanone conformers to use in predicting the cathepsin K binding mode of the azepanone scaffold, as part of a structure-based design effort around this structural class. Since this work was initiated prior to separation of the diastereomers, both the R and S configurations at C-4 were considered. The representative set comprised three conformers of the R diastereomer and four conformers of the S diastereomer with both axial and equatorial orientations of the C-4 substituent for each diastereomer. Conformational analysis indicates that the equatorial C-4 conformer is favored over the axial conformer with a calculated energy difference of approximately 2 kcal mol-1 (see Experimental Section). This is consistent with the smallmolecule crystal structures of both 20 (Figure 2) and 21 (the R diastereomer; data not shown). Each conformer in the representative set was used as a starting point for iterative modeling within the protein active site involving superposition onto related cathepsin K-inhibitor crystal structures.6 Despite the preferences seen in small-molecule crystal structures and conformational analysis, modeling within the protein active site led to the prediction of a cathepsin K binding preference for a pseudo-chair conformation of the S diastereomer with the C-4 substituent in the higher energy axial orientation (Figure 2). 2. Crystal Structures of 20 and 24 Bound to Cathepsin K. Initial difficulty in obtaining a cathepsin K co-crystal structure with an azepanone led to the screening of many analogues and both active and inactive diastereomers for co-crystal formation. Ultimately, we obtained crystals of the complex prepared from cathepsin K and the relatively inactive R diastereomer 21. In previous modeling studies it was extremely challenging to develop a plausible binding model for the R diastereomer; consistent with these modeling studies, fitting of the R diastereomer 21 to the

The inhibitor spans the S3 to S2 pockets of the active site of the protein with the thiol of Cys 25 adding to the sterically more congested Re face of the carbonyl group of the inhibitor.

active site during refinement of the crystal structure proved impossible. Inspection of the active site density led to speculation that the bound compound might in fact be the active diastereomer 20. We tested this hypothesis in an unbiased manner by automated fitting/ refinement of our representative set of seven azepanone conformers to the observed active site density. On the basis of visual selection of the conformer that best fit the active site density, an axial conformer of the S diastereomer 20 was unambiguously selected as the bound inhibitor. Preferred binding of the active S diastereomer 20 versus the inactive R diastereomer 21 is dramatically highlighted by this exclusive crystallographic selection of 20 from a solution of predominantly (96%) 21 during crystal formation and growth. As predicted by the modeling studies, the C-4 leucinamide substituent adopts an axial orientation upon binding to cathepsin K (Figure 6). The 2.0 Å resolution X-ray co-crystal structure of the inhibitor 20-cathepsin K complex shows the inhibitor spanning the S3-S2 pockets of the active site of the enzyme (Figure 4). The C-4 leucinamide of 20 is oriented on the unprimed side of the active site with the isobutyl group bound within the hydrophobic S2 pocket formed by residues Leu 160, Ala 134, and Met 68.

Figure 6. Comparison of the predicted and observed structures of 20 bound to cathepsin K. The conformations and relative positions of several critical active site residues are particularly well-conserved in cathepsin K crystal structures (Gln 19, Cys 25, Trp 26, Tyr 67, His 162, Trp 184; see structures described in ref 6). Heavy-atom superposition of these residues of the enzyme used in modeling onto that observed in the crystal structure yields a close overlap between the predicted binding model (purple) and that observed in the co-crystal structure (color-by-atom). The overlap is especially close for the azepanone rings and proximal parts of the pendant groups. CR, C , and S of Cys 25 and the atoms of 20 are shown.

benzofuran carboxamide group is bound in the S3 binding pocket forming an edge-to-face - stacking interaction with Tyr 67.29 Two hydrogen bonds are observed between Gly 66 of the enzyme and the leucinamide portion of the inhibitor similar to the antiparallel -sheet interactions observed in other inhibitorprotease structures.30 As observed in an earlier cocrystal structure of acyclic inhibitor 2 bound within the active site of cathepsin K,6a the 2-pyridyl moiety of 20 occupies the S2 binding pocket with one of the sulfonamide oxygens forming a hydrogen bond with the indole N-H of Trp 184. The methylene groups of the azepanone ring of 20 are oriented toward solvent (highlighted in red in Figure 4) making no contacts with the protein. The X-ray co-crystal structure is consistent with the formation of a hemithioketal between Cys 25 of cathepsin K and the carbonyl group of the azepanone, confirming our initial hypothesis for the design of reversible, transition-state inhibitors of cysteine proteases. The thiol of the active site cysteine has added to the diastereotopically more hindered Re face of the ketone, syn to the C-4 leucinamide moiety. The oxygen of the resulting hemithioketal is within hydrogen bonding distance of the C(O)NH2 group of Gln 19 and the N-H of Cys 25. The 2.8 Å resolution X-ray co-crystal structure of ketone 24 bound within the active site of human cathepsin K (Figure 5) shares most of the features described for the X-ray co-crystal structure of 20. The co-crystal structure of 24 is consistent with both the S stereochemistry and an axial orientation of the leucinamide substituent at the C-4 chiral center as well as hemithioketal formation between the thiol group of the

active site Cys 25 and the ketone carbonyl of the inhibitor. In contrast to 20, inhibitor 24 spans the S3S3 binding region of the cathepsin K active site with the morpholinoethoxy group extending beyond S3, oriented toward solvent. The pyridyl moiety of the 2-(3pyridin-2-ylphenyl)acetamide extends into the S3 pocket, forming a face-to-face - stacking interaction with Trp 184. The amide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the indole N-H of Trp 184, similar to that observed for the sulfonamide oxygen of 20. Pharmacokinetic Analysis. Parameters which relate the physiochemical properties of a compound to absorption play a critical role in determining the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs.31-33 It has been recognized that the oral bioavailability of compounds may also, in part, be a function of enzymatic processes such as metabolism by cytochrome P-450 enzymes and/or transporter efflux mechanisms mediated by P-glycoproteins.34 The configurational stability of the seven-membered ring ketones has allowed us to delineate the effects of inhibitor cyclization as well as the importance of the stereochemistry of the C-4 chiral center in determining the factors which influence the oral bioavailability of these compounds. The pharmacokinetic profiles and efflux properties35 of cyclic analogues 20, 21, and 24 as well as the acyclic analogues 2, 28, and 36 are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Cyclic analogue 20 showed good oral bioavailability in the rat of 42% with a T1/2 of 30 min and a volume of distribution approximately twice that of total body water when dosed orally at 6.3 mg/kg as a solution in 6% aqueous encapsin and 0.5% DMSO. Azepanone 20 was cleared from the systemic circulation at a rate of 50 mL/min/kg. As shown in Table 4, the m-to-s and s-to-m in vitro permeabilities in rat distal colon show 20 to have good membrane permeability and that it is not a substrate for Pglycoprotein transporters as indicated by the similar rates of flux in both the serosal-to-mucosal and mucosalto-serosal directions. The less potent, C-4 R diastereomer 21 was 9.7% orally bioavailable with a T1/2 ) 33 min and a volume of distribution 1.7 times that of total

which now has the same hydrogen bond donor/acceptor count as 20, did not lead to an improvement in oral bioavailability.37 The potent rat cathepsin K inhibitor 24 showed poor oral bioavailability with a %F < 2.0%. The low permeability of 24 in the m-to-s direction (<0.01 cm/h) and moderate permeability in the s-to-m direction (0.05 cm/h) suggest that the bioavailability of 24 is likely limited by an apical recycling mechanism and not by poor permeability across membranes. The s-to-m transport of 2 and 28 is 10-100-fold greater than their m-to-s transport. These results suggest involvement of specific transport mechanism(s) present in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cells which recycle 2 and 28 from the intracellular compartment back into the lumen of the intestine. Therefore, when these cathepsin K inhibitors were added to the mucosal bathing solution, their transepithelial transport appears to be limited by apical recycling. Addition of these cathepsin K inhibitors to the serosal bathing solution results in an apparently greater permeability due to transcellular movement through the cell aided by this apical membrane transporter. Apical recycling has been suggested to be responsible for low bioavailability, increased variability, drug interactions, and the potential for food effects.38

body water. Diastereomer 21 was cleared at a rate of 52 mL/min/kg. Like 20, azepanone 21 showed good cell permeability and was not a substrate for apical recycling. The lower oral bioavailability of diastereomer 21 relative to that of diastereomer 20 is therefore likely to be the result of first-pass hepatic and/or intestinal metabolism, perhaps by cytochome P-450 enzymes. The different inhibitory and pharmacokinetic profiles of diastereomers 20 and 21 highlight the importance of a configurationally stable C-4 chiral center in these analogues.36 The low m-to-s flux but high s-to-m flux of the corresponding acyclic derivatives 2 and 28 (Table 4) shows these analogues to have good cell permeability which are subject to P-glycoprotein-mediated apical recycling, resulting in poor oral bioavailability relative to azepanone 20.

A comparison of the physiochemical properties of azepanone 20 to those of the acyclic derivatives 2, 28, and 36 reveals all four analogues to have similar molecular weights (mean MW ) 500 g/mol), calculated lipophilicities (mean clog P ) 2.95), and hydrogen bonding capacities. All three of these parameters fall within the empirically derived values developed by Lipinski and co-workers for estimating solubilities and permeabilities of new chemical entities and suggests that other factors are responsible for determining relative oral bioavailabilities within this set of compounds. As shown in Table 4 and discussed above, the relative oral bioavailabilities of acyclic analogues 2 and 28 compared to the cyclic azepanone 20 appear to be a function of apical recycling from intestinal epithelial cells. One mechanism for apical recycling is the Pglycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump which is expressed on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells.39 PGlycoproteins are membrane-bound proteins which are capable of binding a variety of disparate substrates. The drug-binding domains of these enzymes have not yet been fully elucidated, and there has been speculation that several of the postulated transmembrane domains may be involved in substrate recognition. On the basis of the oral bioavailability and efflux properties of these compounds, we suggest that the improved oral bioavailability of azepanone 20 may be the result of the conformational constraint imparted by ring formation effectively locking the rotational freedom of this molecule thereby limiting the number of conformations available for binding to enzymes. From the data presented above it appears that the conformational limitations placed by this specific ring system have locked out those conformations that interact well with those enzyme systems which serve to limit oral bioavailability (i.e. P-gp's) while retaining a bioactive conformation that leads to potent inhibition of the targeted enzyme, cathepsin K. Alternatively, the conformationally flexible acyclic derivatives 2, 28, and 36 are postulated to allow access to conformations which are more likely to be substrates for enzyme systems thereby reducing their relative bioavailability. Conclusions In this paper we have described the synthesis, in vitro activities, small-molecule and cathepsin K-bound crystal structures, and pharmacokinetic properties of a series of configurationally stable azepanone-based inhibitors of the cysteine protease cathepsin K. Expansion of the five- or six-membered ring ketones to a seven-membered ring has led to a dramatic increase in the configurational stability of the C-4 chiral center contained within these inhibitors. The incorporation of functional groups previously shown to improve in vitro and cell-based potencies in the acyclic 1,3-diaminopropanone series produced potent inhibitors of both human and rat cathepsin K in this azepanone class of compounds. The X-ray co-crystal structures of 20 and 24 bound to cathepsin K confirmed our initial design hypotheses. Molecular modeling studies provided a valid azepanonebinding model in advance of the crystal structure and also provided information crucial to solution of the crystal structure. The increased configurational stability of this class has permitted the examination of the pharmacokinetic, physiochemical, and permeability prop-

erties which are key factors in determining oral bioavailability. These studies have suggested that limiting the rotational freedom of an inhibitor by the introduction of a conformational constraint may serve the dual purpose of locking in a bioactive conformation (thereby leading to potent enzyme inhibition) as well as locking out P-glycoprotein, cytochrome P-450, and other metabolizing enzyme substrate conformations (thereby leading to improved oral bioavailability). We expect that incorporation of alternative specificity elements into this azepanone template should allow for the selective inhibition of other cysteine proteases while retaining the desirable pharmacokinetic parameters now recognized in this structural class. The inhibitors presented in this paper should serve as excellent compounds for evaluation in both rat and primate models to determine the potential role of cathepsin K inhibition for the treatment of diseases associated with bone loss in humans. These studies will be reported in detail elsewhere.26,27 Experimental Section

Azepanone-Based Inhibitors of Cathepsin K M tris buffer at pH 7.0 and 90 mM DTT. Crystals of the complex are tetragonal, space group P43, with cell constants a ) 100.9 Å and c ) 53.7 Å. The structure was determined as described above and refined at 2.0 Å. The final Rc was 0.263. Molecular Modeling. Model building and conformational searches were performed with MacroModel41 in the context of the MMFF42 with the GB/SA solvent model.43 Applying energy and conformational difference (based on visual inspection of superimposed conformers) as selection criteria, seven conformers were chosen as representative of the low energy structures observed in the two searches. Both diastereomers were represented, and based on inspection of crystal structures of related complexes, conformers with equatorial and axial peptide were selected. The models were superimposed into the active sites of cathepsin K complexes of the related compounds, and then visually inspected for goodness-of-fit to the cathepsin K active site, which proved especially critical on the unprime side of the active site. Models that formed good interactions with the enzyme were used as starting points for elaboration of the complete inhibitor from the model structure. This procedure, in conjunction with manual adjustment of the initial and progressive binding models, led to the unambiguous selection of a binding model based on an axial conformer of 20. The selected conformer of the model compound allowed for straightforward elaboration to the full inhibitor in the active site, and satisfied several key interactions with the enzyme. Model elaboration from other starting points proved unproductive, although in some cases extensive manual adjustment ultimately yielded a binding conformation very similar to that obtained from simple extension of the selected model. Mass Spectral Analysis of Cathepsin K-Inhibitor Complexes. The inhibitor, dissolved in DMSO, was diluted in water (Milli-Q 18 M) to a molar concentration 5-fold that of the enzyme, with a 20% final volume of DMSO making sure that the inhibitor was completely dissolved. Human cathepsin K was provided in buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM l-cysteine pH 5.5). An aliquot containing 1 nmol of the enzyme was mixed 1:1 with inhibitor solution in a 0.65mL plastic centrifuge tube, vortexed, and a minimum of 120min incubation time was allowed before analysis by LCESIMS. The entire reaction mixture was injected onto a peptide trap and the trap washed with 1 mL of water (Milli-Q 18 M) manually before being back eluted onto the analytical column. Kinetic Study of Epimerization. The rates of epimerization were determined by HPLC analysis utilizing a MetaChem Inertsil ODS-3, 5 µm, 250 × 4.6 mm; eluent: 1/1 acetonitrile/20 mM pH 7.0 phosphate buffer; flow rate, 1 mL/ min; detection, UV at 215 and 254 nm. Each compound was initially prepared in DMSO as a 10 mM stock solution. An appropriate volume of the stock was diluted into the aqueous buffer, pH ranging from 7 to 12.5, at the final concentration of 50 µM. 20-µL aliquots of the resulting solution were withdrawn at designated elapsed times and immediately injected into the HPLC for analysis. For all compounds tested, the epimerization rates were negligible at pH 7, the injection of the test solution into the HPLC eluent, which was 50/50 acetonitrile/pH 7 buffer, essentially stopped the reaction. With the assumption of a first-order kinetics and a final 1:1 equilibrium concentration ratio, the epimerization rate constant k can be determined based on the following equation: A(t)/A(0) ) (e-2kt + 1)/2, where A(0) and A(t) are chromatographic peak areas at time ) 0 and t, respectively. Pharmacokinetic Analysis. Animal procedures reported in these studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals. All dosages were prepared as solutions in water with up to 20% Encapsin and up tp 3% DMSO. Previous experience with the vehicles has shown them to have minimal effect on pharmacokinetics in the rat. Studies were conducted in a crossover fashion on 2 separate days, 2 days apart. On study day 1 rats received a 30-min intravenous infusion of the test compound, and on study day 2, the same rats received an oral bolus gavage of the same compound. All compounds except 28 were

Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2001, Vol. 44, No. 9 1393 dosed as single components (28 was dosed as a mixture of 4 compounds). Blood samples were obtained from a lateral tail vein and plasma isolated by centrifugation. Plasma concentrations of test compounds were quantified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy, with lower limits of quantitation of 5-10 ng/mL. Standard data analysis techniques were used to derive pharmacokinetic parameters from the plasma concentration versus time data.44
