Abstract--With a view to developing a more C-domain-selective angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, a novel analogue of lisinopril has been synthesized which incorporates a bulky P02 tryptophan functionality. This inhibitor demonstrated a significantly increased specificity for the C-domain as compared with lisinopril. Molecular docking revealed hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues of the C-domain S02 subsite. Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lisinopril, a widely used commercially available ACE inhibitor in the treatment of hypertension and myocardial infarction, is a tight-binding competitive inhibitor (Ki = 2.7 · 10À10).1­5 However, side effects associated with ACE inhibitor use, such as angioedema and persistent cough,6 have been attributed to a lack of adequate C-domain-selectivity and an inappropriate suppression of bradykinin hydrolysis by the ACE N-domain. Recently, Georgiadis and co-workers reported the synthesis of a highly C-domain-selective ($3000-fold) phosphinic acid ACE inhibitor, RXP A380.7 One key feature of this C-domain-selectivity is a tryptophan moiety at the P02 position. With a view to developing more C-domain-selective ACE inhibitors with similar pharmacological profiles to that of lisinopril, we determined the effect of the introduction of a tryptophan moiety at the P02 position of lisinopril. A lisinopril analogue, incorporating a tryptophan moiety at the P02 position, was synthesized as follows (Scheme 1): reductive amination of ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenyl butyrate 1 and N-e-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L -lysine 2 using an ethanolic solution of NaBH3CN8 gave key intermediate 3 as a 55:45 mixture of diastereoisomers. Coupling of compound 3 with the L -tryptophan methyl ester (prepared by methylation of tryptophan in the presence of

thionyl chloride and methanol as described previously9,10) was effected using EDCÆHCl in the presence of HOBt and diisopropylethylamine to afford the diastereomeric pseudopeptide 4 in 74% yield. Characterization of this diastereomeric mixture was achieved from the mass (EI-MS) and 1H NMR spectroscopic data. The EI-MS data indicated a molecular ion peak at 637 corresponding to M++H. The 1H NMR spectrum showed two singlets at d 3.71 and 3.73 ppm corresponding to the two methyl ester groups of the diastereomers. When the diastereomeric mixture 4 was stirred in 4 N HCl in EtOAc at room temperature for 24 h, followed by solvent removal and stirring in 0.5 N LiOH for a further 5 h, the desired product 5 was obtained in quantitative yield as a mixture of diastereoisomers (Scheme 1). Purification and separation of the 60:40 mixture by HPLC delivered the two diastereomers (5a and 5b) (Fig. 1). The two isomers (5a and 5b) of the lisinopril­tryptophan analogues were tested for ACE inhibitory activity using purified testis ACE (C-domain) and somatic ACE N-domain together with Z-Phe-His-Leu as substrate.11 The ACE inhibitory activities were determined as previously described11 with some modifications. Recombinant truncated forms of the C- and N-domains12,13 were used in the enzyme assays. Enzyme (4 lg/ml) was pre-incubated with inhibitor at concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 lM. Residual enzyme activity was determined from enzyme­inhibitor solution using Z-Phe-His-Leu at two substrate concentrations. The enzyme assay was

adapted so that it could be carried out in a 96-well plate and the fluorescence was measured at Ex = 360 nm; Em = 486 nm on a Varian Cary Eclipse plate reader. All assays were conducted in triplicate. Inhibition curves were plotted using GraphPad Prism 4.01 and Ki values were determined from Dixon plots of 1/V versus [I]. The ACE inhibitory activities of 5a and 5b are shown in Table 1. The compounds all showed Ki values in the micromolar range as compared with the nanomolar Ki value of lisinopril. Incorporation of a tryptophan moiety at the P02 position of lisinopril (compounds 5a and 5b) resulted in a marked increase in C-domain-selectivity (25- to 100-fold) as compared with lisinopril (2.6-fold) (Table 1). This observation is in agreement with previously reported work by Georgiadis et al.7 suggesting that a large P02 residue is an important feature for C-domain-selectivity.

To support these observations, the synthesized compounds 5a and 5b were subsequently modeled into the binding sites of the testis ACE (C-domain) crystal structure14 and a homology model of sACE N-domain. Molecular modeling calculations were performed using the DISCOVER module of INSIGHT II (Accelrys Inc., Version 98.0) on a Silicon Graphics Octane 1 workstation. The starting structure was the X-ray crystal structure of testis ACE complexed with the inhibitor lisinopril14 and the homology modeled structure of the N-domain. After removing the crystallographic water molecules and adding hydrogens, the CVFF and the ESFF (metal adapted) force-fields were used in all energy minimizations and dynamic runs. The conjugate gradient minimization algorithm was used after running 1000 initial steps, and then 3000 cycles of molecular dynamics followed by 3000 cycles of energy minimization in an NTV ensemble, at a temperature of 300 K.

NI: No inhibition up to a concentration of 500 lM. Total potential energy (PE) is the sum of the energies calculated for all the bonded-atom interactions and for all the nonbonded-atom pairs.

All calculations were carried out in a dielectric constant ° of 1.00 and a cut-off distance of 9.50 A. The structures of compounds 5a and 5b were generated with standard bond lengths and angles using the builder tool of INSIGHT II software (Accelrys Inc.) and then minimized. The initial position of the compounds in the C- and Ndomain active sites of ACE was obtained by superimposing their important pharmacophoric groups on the corresponding atoms of lisinopril in the tACE-lisinopril complex. After removal of the reference inhibitor (lisinopril), the structure of the inhibitor-complex was refined by running energy minimizations and molecular dynamics. These compounds were found to occupy the S1, S2, and S02 subsites, and an example of compound 5a in the active site of testis ACE is shown in Figure 2. From the molecular docking experiments, the energy-minimized bound conformers of the inhibitors in the active site of the C- and N-domains were obtained. The inhibitors all exhibited negative total potential energies for the protein­ligand interaction. These were consistent with the determined biological binding affinities for the relevant domains and it was an indication of the relative stability of the enzyme­ligand complex (Table 1). The docking of compounds 5a and 5b into both domains showed consistency between the interactions of key ACE active site residues and the inhibitors, and also revealed that the synthesized compounds bound to the Cand N-domains in a similar fashion. The residues forming the subsites of the C- and N-domain active site were defined as those located at a dis° tance less than 6.00 A from the important functionalities of the inhibitors. The active site residues for the C-domain were Gln281, Thr282, His353, Ala354, Ser355, Ala356, Val379, Val380, His383, Glu384, His387, Phe391, Glu411, Asp453, Phe457, Phe460, Lys+511, Phe512, His513, Ser516, Val518, Tyr520,

Tyr523, and Phe527. The binding of compounds 5a and 5b in the C-domain active site resembled that of lisinopril, where the phenyl group of the P1 phenylalanine interacted with the hydrophobic Val518 and the polar Ser355 residues of the S1 subsite and the lysyl group was accommodated in the S02 subsite. The distance between the phenylalanine-carbonyl and the Zn-atom in the active site of the C-domain was observed to be ° ° 2.73 A for compound 5a and 2.74 A for compound 5b. These values are within the range of a reasonable H-bonding interaction. The S02 subsite of the enzyme readily accommodated the tryptophan moiety of compounds 5a and 5b. This observation is in agreement with previous studies which have highlighted the importance of a deep S02 pocket as a determinant of C-domain-selectivity.7,15 The P02 tryptophan moieties of compounds 5a and 5b demonstrated additional hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with S02 residues Thr282, Val379, Val380, and Asp453 of the C-domain active site (Fig. 2), and may thus explain the increased C-domain-selectivity of these compounds as compared with lisinopril. Here, the aromatic ring of the P02 tryptophan increases the overall hydrophobicity of the molecule and consequently the interaction with the hydrophobic Val379 and Val380 residues in the C-domain. These residues are replaced by the polar residues Ser357 and Thr358 in the N-domain. The other striking feature is the ability to establish a strong H-bonding interaction between the indole-NH and Asp453 in the C-domain which is replaced by a less polar Glu431 in the N-domain. This amino acid's side chain is longer than that of Asp, decreasing the size of the binding pocket. Interactions with the S02 residues of the C- and N-domains are absent in the case of lisinopril which lacks a bulky P02 functionality. From

the molecular docking experiments and the observed ACE inhibitory activities, together with previous studies by Sieburth and co-workers,16 the most potent compound 5a possesses an S-configuration at the stereogenic center bearing the zinc-binding carboxylate group. Docking experiments revealed that the total potential energies for the complex of compound 5a with the C-domain and the N-domain were À869.6 and À630.1 kcal molÀ1, respectively. Whereas, for compound 5b they were À830.6 and À704.3 kcal molÀ1 for the C-domain and N-domain, respectively (Table 1). This is in agreement with the observed biological inhibiting binding affinity for compound 5a, which was found to be >100-fold more C-domain-selective as compared with lisinopril (2.6-fold) and more C-domain-selective as compared with compound 5b. In summary, we have described the synthesis of lisinopril analogues incorporating a bulky tryptophan moiety at the P02 position. ACE inhibitory activities and molecular docking experiments have shown that this incorporation leads to a marked increase in C-domain-selectivity.
