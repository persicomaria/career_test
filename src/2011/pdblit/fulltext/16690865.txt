The fact that translation initiation directed from CrPV IRES, which relies solely on the ribosome itself, is severely impaired in Dkc1m cells strongly implies that the molecular defect intrinsically resides in the inability of Dkc1m ribosomes to efficiently engage the IRES element. Taken together, these findings allow us to propose a model whereby reductions in rRNA modifications due to dyskerin malfunction affect the translation of important cellular IRES mRNAs, which may require more direct interactions with the ribosome for translation initiation, thereby contributing to specific pathological features of X-DC. Although we cannot determine how defects in other cellular functions attributed to dyskerin activity may contribute to X-DC, these findings indicate a previously unknown molecular mechanism by which impairments in rRNA modifications affect translation control and lead to disease pathogenesis.

RNA Recognition and Cleavage by a Splicing Endonuclease
Song Xue, Kate Calvin, Hong Li* The RNA splicing endonuclease cleaves two phosphodiester bonds within folded precursor RNAs during intron removal, producing the functional RNAs required for protein synthesis. Here we describe at a resolution of 2.85 angstroms the structure of a splicing endonuclease from Archaeglobus fulgidus bound with a bulge-helix-bulge RNA containing a noncleaved and a cleaved splice site. The endonuclease dimer cooperatively recognized a flipped-out bulge base and stabilizes sharply bent bulge backbones that are poised for an in-line RNA cleavage reaction. Cooperativity arises because an arginine pair from one catalytic domain sandwiches a nucleobase within the bulge cleaved by the other catalytic domain. he removal of intervening sequences in functional RNAs is required in all domains of life. Introns found in nuclear tRNA and archaeal RNA are removed by protein enzymes--an endonuclease, a ligase, and, in some organisms, a 2¶-phosphotransferase (1­5). Critical to this splicing mechanism are the recognition of the intron-exon junctions and the subsequent breakage of the two phosphodiester bonds. This process is mediated by the endonuclease. The splicing endonucleases characterized so far belong to one of four families: homodimers (a2) (6), homotetramers (a4) (7), homodimers of two heterodimers (a2b2) (8, 9), or heterotetramers (abdg) (10­12). Despite the differences in subunit composition, all splicing

endonucleases comprise two conserved catalytic units and two structural units that play roles in correctly orienting the catalytic sites (13). All splicing endonucleases recognize the bulge-helix-bulge (BHB) motif that is composed of two three-nucleotide bulges separated by 4 base pairs (bp) (6, 8, 9, 14­16). Each bulge contains a cleavage site immediately after the second bulge nucleotide. In addition to the recognition of the canonical BHB RNA motif, splicing endonucleases of different families exhibit distinct substrate recognition properties. The localized structural fold of the BHB motif is sufficient for the removal of archaeal introns from various segments of precursor transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and some mRNA; the secondary structure of the BHB motif is solely responsible for its recognition by the archaeal splicing endonuclease (17­20). Nuclear precursor tRNAs, however, have additional recognition elements in their mature domains that are required for splicing (16, 21­23). The eukaryal abdg splicing endoVOL 312 SCIENCE

nuclease is composed of Sen2, Sen34, Sen54, and Sen15 subunits and locates the splice sites via a Bruler mechanism.[ This mechanism requires the specific recognition of two features in precursor tRNAs: the cloverleaf structure of the mature domain (21, 24) and an anticodonintron base pair (A-I pair) adjacent to the 3¶ bulge (22, 23). It has been proposed that the eukaryal endonuclease, while maintaining the ability to recognize the minimal BHB RNA, has acquired additional RNA recognition properties. Based on the cleavage products and conserved catalytic residues, all splicing endonucleases appear to use a similar mechanism. Cleavage by the splicing endonuclease generates 5¶-hydroxyl and 2¶,3¶-cyclic phosphate termini (1, 2, 25). These products suggest an SN2-type in-line attack by the nearby 2¶-hydroxyl on phosphorus and a trigonal bipyramidal transition state, similar to that used by the RNase A family of ribonucleases (26). In previously determined archaeal-splicing endonuclease structures, three invariant residues--a histidine, a lysine, and a tyrosine--form a closely spaced triad. In the Methanococcus jannaschii endonuclease structure, a bound sulfate ion, which was proposed to mimic a phosphate, was found in the center of the triad (27), which further implicates the triad in RNA cleavage. However, there is no structural evidence to confirm the catalytic roles of each of the triad residues, and the catalytic mechanism of the splicing endonuclease remains elusive. We have determined the cocrystal structure of a dimeric splicing endonuclease from Archaeglobus fulgidus (AF) bound to a BHB RNA that was formed from two annealed 21oligomer synthetic oligonucleotide (see Fig. 1A). One strand of the RNA contains a 2¶-deoxy­

modified uridine at position 14 (dU14) to prevent its cleavage during crystallization, whereas the other strand was cleaved at a normal 3¶ splice site (28). The endonuclease­21-oligomer BHB RNA structure, containing two endonucleaseRNA complexes not related by crystallographic symmetry, was determined by molecular replacement methods and refined at 2.85 ) resolution to an Rfree of 29.6% (28). The mean precision of the atomic coordinates is 0.45 ) (table S1). In the complex, the AF endonuclease is the same symmetric dimer as the free AF endonuclease with the structure deviating only in local regions (29, 30). In contrast, the BHB RNA differs significantly from its unbound solution structure as observed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods (Fig. 1B). Curved when in solution (31), the helical portion of the BHB structure displays little bending when bound to the endonuclease (Fig. 1B). In addition, the three bulge nucleotides are completely flipped out of their stacking positions when bound, but not so when in solution. Consequently, the two bulges rise above the flat minor groove of the central helix and form two distinct protrusions to interact with the endonuclease (Fig. 1B). The minor groove of the 4-bp central helix of the BHB RNA docks at the center of a flat surface formed by both subunits of the endonuclease (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, the entire base-paired region of the bound BHB RNA closely resembles a single A-form helix. The phosphate backbone of the uncleaved 5¶ splice-site bulge bends È180- and crosses over itself, forming an open knot (Fig. 1C). Similarly, the phosphate backbone of the cleaved 3¶ splice-site bulge makes an open knot in preparation for cleavage (Fig. 1C). This tight looping brings the two base pairs flanking the bulge into stacking positions as observed in a regular A-form helix. Thus the enzyme engineers a contortion in RNA to orient it for cleavage. The endonuclease-RNA complex buries an extensive solvent-accessible surface area (3208 )2). However, the Bhot spots[ of interactions are surprisingly confined. The primary specificity elements are the three bulge nucleotides. They interact with four positively charged residues of the endonuclease--His257, Arg280, Arg286, and Arg302--in a sequenceindependent manner. Arg286 is in a tight turn that connects a5 and b10 and interacts with the phosphate group of central helix nucleotides C11/u11 (fig. S1). Sequences of this tight turn are well conserved. Arg286 is replaced by lysine in most other organisms, with a few exceptions in eukaryal subunits, including human Sen2 which has serine at this position (fig. S2). The hallmark of the AF endonucleaseRNA recognition is a cross-subunit argininenucleotide-arginine sandwich. At both splice sites, the nucleobase of the first bulge nucleotide, A13/a13, protrudes deeply into the endonuclease and is sandwiched by Arg280 and Arg302 (Fig. 2). Remarkably, the Arg280-Arg302 pair of one subunit stabilizes the bulge that is cleaved by the other subunit (Fig. 2A). Arg280 is strictly conserved, whereas Arg302 may be replaced by an aromatic residue in other archaeal and eukaryal organisms (fig. S2). For each cation-p sandwich, the planes formed by the atoms of the two guanidinium groups are È3.8 to 4.1 ) away from and nearly parallel to the adenine ring. This distance corresponds to the most favorable energy of interaction between the guanidinium group and the adenine base according to an ab initio quantum mechanics computation (32). Removal of the nucleobase from nucleotide A13 severely impairs the cleavage activity on the BHB RNA (see fig. S3A). Furthermore, the guanidinium group of Arg280 forms a double hydrogen bond with the phosphate group 3¶ of the last bulge nucleotide (G16 or g16) and the 2¶-hydroxyl oxygen atom of the first bulge nucleotide (A13/a13) (Fig. 2, B and C). This double hydrogen bond constrains the orientation of the guanidinium group and thus maximizes the cation-p interaction while stabilizing the sharply bent bulge backbone. The importance of Arg280 is demonstrated by the fact that it is one of four strictly conserved residues, and its mutation to lysine completely abolished RNA cleavage activity (fig. S3B). RNA functional groups of the BHB motif also stabilized the sharply bent bulge backbone. The phosphate group of G16/g16, which closes the bulge loop, is near the center of the negatively charged bulge backbone (Fig. 2D). The nonbridging oxygens of this phosphate form short hydrogen bonds with the 2¶-hydroxyl groups of C12 (2.4 )) and A13 (2.7 )), and a long hydrogen bond with A15 (3.5 )) (Fig. 2D). Methylation of the 2¶-hydroxyl group of C12 or A13 impairs cleavage activity on the 21-oligomer oligonucleotide BHB RNA substrate (fig. S3A). The second bulge nucleotide (dU14/a2314) is also flipped out of helical stacking, pointing in a direction perpendicular to that of the first bulge nucleotide. It is recognized primarily by its ribose ring and its connection to the wellpositioned scissile phosphate group (Fig. 2B). Residue Leu255 in loop L7 of the endonuclease forms sequence-independent van der Waals contact with the base (Fig. 2B). This mode of

(E) A-minor interaction mediated by the last bulge nucleotide (A15/a15) and the adjacent central helix base pair g9-C12/G9-c12. Note the g9-C12 base pair corresponds to the A-I pair shown in Fig. 1A. recognition partially explains why the second bulge nucleotide is the least conserved among the three at the 3¶ splice site (fig. S4). The third bulge nucleotide (A15/a15) is at a key location to interact with endonuclease as well as to participate in RNA folding. The flipped-out A15/a15 base protrudes toward the central helix and in the direction opposite that of the first bulge nucleotide (A13/a13). The base of A15/a15 is held in place by the conserved His257 residue through aromatic stacking (Fig. 2E). This interaction causes an unfavorable twist to the nucleoside moiety. Correspondingly, the torsion angles around the P­O3¶ bond for both dU14 (z 0 125-) and A15 (z 0 134-) deviate from the typical values observed for A-form RNA (z 0 289-) (33). The adenine ring of A15/a15 forms an A-minor interaction with the g9-C12/G9-c12 base pair, although A15/a15 is slightly out of the plane of the base pair (Fig. 2E). The A-minor interaction observed in the BHB RNA is a common type of tertiary RNA interaction similar to that between the G1364-C637 base pair and A521 observed in a Haloarcula marismortui 50S ribosome structure (34) and that between the G212-C109 base pair and A184 in a Tetrahymena group I self-splicing intron structure (35). The stacking between the nucleobase of A15/a15 and the imidazole ring of His257 facilitates the A-minor interaction (Fig. 2E). Removing the nucleobase of A15/a15 abolishes enzyme activity on a modified 21-oligomer oligonucleotide BHB RNA (fig. S3A). The unexpected interaction between A15/ a15 and g9-C12/G9-c12 explains the importance of the A-I base pair in determining the 3¶ splice site of eukaryal pre-tRNAs (22, 23). It was previously shown that the identity of the A-I base pair required for cleavage of the 3¶ splice site by Xenopus endonuclease is correlated with the identity of the first 3¶-exon nucleotide (22). The A-minor interaction observed between a15 and G9-c12, which correspond to the first 3¶ exon nucleotide and the A-I base pair in a eukaryal pre-tRNA, provides the structural basis for their observed interdependence (22, 23). The endonuclease-RNA complex provides structural evidence for cooperativity between the two catalytic subunits. The cross-subunit stabilization of each bulge by cation-p sandwich (Fig. 2A) suggests that cognate interactions between one bulge and both subunits may facilitate the binding of the other bulge. Consequently, disruption of the structural integrity of one bulge would cause impaired cleavage on both bulges. Indeed, in addition to impairing cleavage of the 5¶ bulge, 2¶-O-methylation of C12 or A13, or removal of the nucleobase from nucleotide A13 at the 5¶ bulge, prevented the cleavage of the 3¶ bulge (fig. S3A). These results lend strong support to a model of cooperative binding of the two catalytic endonuclease subunits to the BHB RNA. Remarkably, the observed cooperativity between two catalytic subunits in the AF endonuclease-RNA complex was also demonstrated in the yeast splicing endoVOL 312 SCIENCE nuclease by selective mutation of its catalytic subunits (36). The RNA recognition elements identified here are asymmetrically disposed between the two splice sites in eukaryal pre-tRNAs, although the sites themselves are equally utilized (22, 37). This appears to conflict with cooperativity because the typically unconserved 5¶ splice site in nuclear pre-tRNAs would lead to overall inefficient cleavage at both sites. We suggest that the two catalytic subunits are diverged to complement the asymmetrically conserved splice sites. Consistent with this proposal, the Xenopus splicing endonuclease can cleave a miniprecursor tRNA containing only the mature domain and the 3¶ splice site (16), and mutation of the Arg280-equivalent residue in yeast Sen2 only mildly impaired cleavage of the 3¶ splice site (36). Interactions between the RNA and the endonuclease at the active sites are consistent with the involvement of catalytic triad residues in cleavage reactions (Fig. 3). At the site of cleavage, the endonuclease facilitates a near in-line geometry of the attacking 2¶-oxygen, the scissile phosphate, and the leaving 5¶-oxygen that is required for RNA cleavage at this site (Fig. 3, insert). In addition, the scissile phosphates at both 5¶ and 3¶ splice sites are at the center of three strictly conserved residues, Tyr246, His257, and Lys287, the same as the position occupied by the bound sulfate in the crystal structure of the M. jannaschii endonuclease (27). The proSp nonbridging oxygen of the 5¶ splice site is

The third catalytic triad residue, Tyr246, is 2.2 ) from the modeled 2¶-hydroxyl oxygen in the 2¶-endo sugar-puckering conformation (3.5 ) for 3¶-endo sugar-puckering). The placement of the three residues suggests a catalytic mechanism where Tyr246 deprotonates the nucleophilic 2¶-oxygen, His257 protonates the leaving 5¶ hydroxyl oxygen Esimilar to His119 of RNase A (26)^, and Lys287 stabilizes the developing negative charge of the transition state (Fig. 3B). The AF endonuclease-RNA cocrystal structure provides a basis for understanding the mode of RNA recognition by the eukaryal endonuclease. Based on sequence comparisons and pairwise interactions identified by yeast twohybrid methods, it is believed that the abgd eukaryal endonuclease has the same overall architecture as archaeal endonucleases, with the structural subunits Sen15 and Sen54 pairing with the 5¶-cleaving Sen2 and the 3¶-cleaving Sen34, respectively (7, 10, 11, 27). Thus, each AF endonuclease unit can be assigned specifically to one of the abgd subunits. We created a structural model of a precursor tRNA substrate by superimposing the anticodon stem of the yeast tRNAphe structure onto the stem 5¶ of the 3¶ bulge of the BHB RNA (pretRNAArcheuka) and analyzed how the pretRNAArcheuka substrate interacts with the eukaryal endonuclease subunits (Fig. 4). This showed that the D arm and the acceptor stem of pre-tRNAArcheuka would interact with the Sen54 subunit (Fig. 4). This mode of RNA-protein interaction is consistent with the active but imprecise cleavage of a composite pre-tRNA lacking the acceptor stem by the Xenopus splicing endonuclease (16) and suggests a role of Sen54 in the ruler mechanism of splice-site selection. The cocrystal structure of the AF endonuclease-RNA complex identifies an evolutionarily conserved RNA recognition and cleavage mechanism for the removal of introns by the splicing endonuclease. Splice-site recognition depends on the chemical features of both protein and RNA residues. The challenge will be to dissect the functional role of each of these components in RNA recognition and in catalysis. SCIENCE VOL 312

Martin G. L. van den Heuvel, Martijn P. de Graaff, Cees Dekker* Integration of biomolecular motors in nanoengineered structures raises the intriguing possibility of manipulating materials on nanometer scales. We have managed to integrate kinesin motor proteins in closed submicron channels and to realize active electrical control of the direction of individual kinesin-propelled microtubule filaments at Y junctions. Using this technique, we demonstrate molecular sorting of differently labeled microtubules. We attribute the steering of microtubules to electric field­induced bending of the leading tip. From measurements of the orientationdependent electrophoretic motion of individual, freely suspended microtubules, we estimate the net applied force on the tip to be in the picoNewton range and we infer an effective charge of 12 e­ per tubulin dimer under physiological conditions. ecent years have witnessed a strong interest in the exploration of biomolecular motors in nanotechnology (1­4). A molecular motor such as kinesin, which translocates in 8-nm steps along microtubule filaments through hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (5), can potentially be used as the workhorse in miniaturized analytical systems or nanoelectromechanical systems (6, 7). In particular, it is envisioned that microtubule shuttles translocating over kinesin-coated tracks can be used to carry a specific cargo to designated places on a chip (8). First steps toward such applications have been realized, such as partial confinement of microtubules to micron-sized kinesin-coated trenches (9­11), docking of shuttles to their tracks (12), rectification of motility (13, 14), and coupling of cargo (15). The much-sought-after goal of dynamic control of the direction of individual microtubules, a key requirement for molecular sorting applications, has not been achieved so far. Attempts to use electric fields to manipulate the negatively charged microtubules have only resulted in

large-scale alignment (16) or bulk transport of the filaments (11, 12). In this report, we reconstituted the kinesinmicrotubule transport system in enclosed fluidic channels, which represents two major advances. First, fluidic channels achieved full confinement of the microtubules to their tracks, without the need for any surface modifications or selective patterning of kinesin molecules in open-trench structures. Second, the confined geometry of channels allowed the localized application of strong, directed electric fields, which could be exploited to steer individual microtubules, as well as to perform single-molecule biophysical experiments. By measuring the electrophoretic motion of individual microtubules, we determined the magnitude of the electric field­induced force on the microtubule tip, and we directly confirmed the predicted anisotropy in electrophoretic mobility. We fabricated fluidic channels 800 nm deep (17) between entrance holes in fused-silica substrates and sealed them (Fig. 1, A and B). Microtubule motility was reconstituted in the channels by a pressure-driven flow to flush the necessary protein constituents (casein, kinesin, and fluorescently labeled paclitaxel-stabilized associated protein­free microtubules) from the entrance reservoirs into the channels (Fig. 1C).

Molecular Sorting by Electrical Steering of Microtubules in Kinesin-Coated Channels

Using epifluorescence microscopy, we could discern microtubules moving on either the top or bottom surface of a channel by adjusting the focus of the objective (Fig. 1D). The enclosed geometry of the device completely confined the microtubules to their tracks (Fig. 1E). All regions could be coated with kinesin proteins, even less accessible regions in more complicated networks, such as bends (Fig. 1F). The speed of the microtubules in our channels (0.75 T 0.02 mm/s) was the same as on a glass coverslip in a standard flow cell (0.74 T 0.04 mm/s). By applying a voltage difference between platinum electrodes inserted in reservoirs at either end of a perpendicular cross-channel, we induced an electric field E perpendicular to the direction of microtubule motion (Fig. 2A). In this way, the electrical force on the negatively charged microtubules was directed opposite to the electric field. We demonstrated that microtubules can be directed with an electric field. The trajectory of a microtubule that was subjected to an electric field of strength kEk 0 35 kV/m (70 V over 2 mm) is shown in Fig. 2B. At the beginning of the path, the microtubule was oriented perpendicular to the electric field. As the microtubule progressed, its leading end gradually oriented itself opposite to the applied field, until the microtubule finally changed course by 90- and moved parallel to the electric field and toward the positive electrode. A trace of the leadingand trailing-end coordinates of the microtubule showed that they followed exactly the same path (Fig. 2B). This clearly indicates that there was no motion of the microtubule perpendicular to its long axis, which is expected if kinesin molecules hold onto the microtubule. Up to 110 kV/m, we did not observe a measurable increase or decrease of the microtubule velocity due to the electric field (18). The electric force was used to actively steer individual microtubules into a desired channel of a Y junction, across and through which a perpendicular channel was fabricated in order to confine the electric field. As a microtubule approached the junction, it was steered into the right channel by adjustment of the perpendicular electric field, whose magnitude was between 0
