Zinc-finger structures
Robert Kaptein
University of Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands Although the spatial structures of various classes of zinc-finger peptides were known from two-dimensional NMR studies, our knowledge about their interaction with DNA has dramatically increased during the past year. In particular, for the two major classes of zinc fingers, i.e. the transcription factor IliA-like fingers and those of the nuclear hormone receptors, the structures of protein-DNA complexes have been solved by X-ray crystallography. Thus, we now know how the three-finger DNA-binding domain of the mouse protein Zif268 recognizes its DNA-binding site and, similarly, the interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor and its hormone response element have been revealed. This work and other zinc-finger studies are reviewed with a special emphasis on the structural aspects of zinc fingers and their interactions with DNA.

Introduction
Many gene regulatory proteins interact with DNA (or RNA) through small Zn 2+-containing peptide domains called zinc fingers. These were first identified in the Xen~ pus transcription factor IliA (TFIIIA), which contains a tandem array of nine such domains [1,2]. In this type of zinc finger, Zn 2 + is coordinated by two cysteine and two histidine residues and it is therefore designated as CC/HH (for the classification system used, see [3]). Later, similar peptide domains were characterized containing various amounts of cysteine and histidine residues at conserved positions in the amino acid sequence. Consequently, four major subclasses are now recognized: (a) The original TFIIlA-type zinc fingers. These are separately folded domains of 30 amino acid residues, the three-dimensional structure of which was first elucidated by two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods [4,5] and recently by X-ray crystallography [6"']. (b) The DNA-bindhag domains of the nuclear hormone receptors ( f o r a review, see [7]). Members of this family of ligandinducible transcription factors always feature two zinc fingers of the CC/CC type. For the glucocorticoid [8] and oestrogen [9"'] receptors, the NMR solution structure of the DNA-binding region showed that the two fingers form a single folded protein domain. This finding has since been corroborated by a crystallographic study of the glucocorticoid receptor-DNA interaction [10.,]. (c) The retroviral gag proteins contain small 14-residue zinc fingers of the CC/HC type. The structure of the Cd 2 + form of an 18-residue peptide of the HIV p55 gag protein has been solved by NMR [11]. (d) GAL4 and a number

of other yeast transcription factors such as PPR1, ARGII, LEU3 and LAC9 have six invariant cysteines and bind two Zn2+ ions in a binuclear cluster [12,13]. For this class, no three-dimensional structure has yet been reported. Although some authors prefer to restrict the term 'zinc finger' to the original TFIIIA-like peptide domains, it has become customary in the molecular biology literature to use the term in a broader sense to include all four subclasses, and I shaU do so accordingly. It should be noted, however, that the only common element is the fact that Zn 2+ is bound by a short peptide segment containing cysteine and/or histidine residues. At the tertiary-structure level the zinc fingers of the various subclasses are entirely different! This has become further apparent with the first crystallographic results on DNA complexes of the three-finger peptide of the mouse protein Zif268 [6-.] and of the glucocorticoid receptor DNA-binding domain [10.-]. These studies not only confirmed the basic features of the NMR structural work, but went much further in providing a wealth of information on the way in which these proteins recognize their DNA target sites. Here, I shall review these recent results and provide an update with respect to last year's review on zinc fingers [3].

TFIIIA-like zinc fingers
The consensus sequence for this class of peptides is Tyr/Phe-X-Cys-X2 or 4-Cys-X3-Phe-Xs-LeuXz-His-X3-5 His (where X represents any amino acid). The initial

Protein-nucleic acid interactions

structures of single-finger domains of Xfin [4] and ADR1 [5] derived from 2D NMR had shown that the basic structure consists of a 13-hairpin in which the residues following the first cysteine form the turn. An cx-helix starts halfway along the central loop between the cysteine and histidine residues and is packed against the 13-sheet by virtue of hydrophobic interactions involving the conserved apolar residues. The ~-hairpin and c~-helix domains are also linked by the tetrahedraUy coordinated Zn 2+ ion. During the past year, two more NMR structures of synthetic single zinc-finger peptides were reported. The human male-associated protein ZFY has 13 zinc fingers, for which the number of residues in the His-His loop alternates between 3 and 4. The 'odd' and 'even' zinc fingers appear to have a similar structure [14.] indicating a common mode of DNA binding. A high-resolution NMR structure has been reported for a CC/HH zinc finger of the human enhancer-binding protein, based on a relatively Large number (487) of distance constraints and 63 torsion angle constraints [15"]. Interestingly, it was noted in the latter study that a major part of the finger showed a high degree of structural homology with an ovomucoid proteinase inhibitor. This suggests that the zincfinger fold is not unique, but represents a more general protein-folding motif. In several NMR studies, zinc-finger peptides were found to be present in multiple conformations in solution [14.,16,17]. From an analysis of slow-exchange cross peaks in nuclear Overhauser effect spectra of the enhancer-binding protein, it was suggested that the exchange occurs between a major conformation, in which zinc is liganded by all four residues, and minor forms, in which one histidine ligand is replaced by a water molecule [17]. From a comparison of the four NMR structures [4,5,14., 15.] and the X-ray structure of the three-finger domain of Zif268 [6o,], one can conclude the following. Basically, all CC//-IH fingers have the same I]-hairpin/0t-helix fold. Differences arise in the length of the I]-strands and a-helix. When the His-His loop contains three residues, the cz-helix appears to extend beyond the last histidine residue. When there are four or five residues in this loop, the conformation in this region is altered in order to place the last histidine residue in a correct position for metal binding. Also, the helical region has various amounts of 310-helix character, either in the middle of the helix [6o.] or at the end [4]. Overall, these appear to

be small structural variations on the basic theme, which had been already predicted before the results of the NMR and X-ray studies became available [18,19].

The Zif268-DNA

complex

Pavletich and Pabo [6°'] have cocrystallized the threefinger DNA-binding domain of the mouse protein Zif268 (also called Krox 24, NGFI-A or Egrl) with its consensus DNA-binding site and have solved the structure of the complex at 2.1 ~ resolution (see Fig. 1 for the protein and DNA sequences). In this structure, which is shown schematically in Fig. 2, the zinc fingers wrap around the DNA double helix, making contacts in the major groove primarily through the amino-terminal portions of the a-helices. As there are no contacts between the fingers, they act as independent units, each recognizing a 3 bp subset of the consensus sequence. Specific DNA recognition is accomplished through 11 direct hydrogen bonds between amino acid side chains and bases. The residues involved are primarily arginines (see Fig. 3), which make a number of classical Seeman-Rosenberg-Rich-type [20] double hydrogen bonds with guanine bases. Surprisingly, these contacts are all made with only one DNA strand, the upper G-rich strand of Fig. l(b). An invariant interaction involves the arginine residue preceding the helix. The side chain of this arginine is stabilized by two hydrogen bonds with the conserved aspartate residue at position 2 in the helix providing a very stable hydrogen-bonded network. The general arrangement of the fingers around the DNA and some of the specific interactions had been predicted by a model-building study [21.], based on mutational analysis and a sequence comparison with Spl, another three-finger protein which recognizes a similar 9 bp target sequence. Scaffolding interactions are also present involving the DNA backbone. It came as another surprise that one of these involves the Na atom of the last histidine residue, the same that coordinates Zn 2 + with its Ne atom. As the Zn 2 + ion will certainly polarize the imidazole ring of this histidine residue, this points to an (indirect) role of zinc in the DNA interaction. Further backbone contacts are made by the conserved arginine in the 13-strand (Argl4 in the first finger) and a number of arginine and serine residues that make different contacts in the various fingers.

Nuclear hormone receptor DNA-binding domains
The solution structure of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA-binding domain determined by 2D NMR methods [8] was described in last year's review [3]. GR is a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors that all have a modular structure. The proteins have separate domains for various functions such as activation of transcription (A/B-domain), DNA binding (C-domain) and hormone binding (E-domain) as reviewed in [23]. The highly conserved DNA-binding domain is a double CC/CC zinc finger, as shown in Fig. 4(a) for GR. The structure of the C domain of the oestrogen receptor (ER) has also been determined by NMR methods [9°o]. The main features of these NMR structures are also seen in the X-ray structure of the C domain of GR complexed with a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) [10°-], and can be summarized as follows. Two modules can be distinguished (see Fig. 4), containing a Zn 2+ coordination site and an amphipathic a-helix, respectively. These modules fold together to form a single globular protein domain, in which the helices cross at an angle of ,,, 90*. The main interactions stabilizing the globular fold are those between conserved hydrophobic residues such as (for GR) Phe463 and Phe464 of the first helix, Tyr497 and Leu501 of the second, and several others. A short antipamllel B-sheet involving residues 440-441 and 455--457 of the first finger of GR is seen in both the NMR and X-ray structures (but has not been reported for ER). Interestingly, the NMR and X-ray derived structures also exhibit differences, which appear to be related to the fact that the NMR studies were performed on the protein free in solution whereas the crystal structure was obtained for the protein-DNA complex. Thus, the conformation of the second finger up to the start of the helix is ill defined by the NMR constraints for both GR and ER domains, suggesting that this peptide segment is highly flexible. By contrast, in the X-ray structure, this region is much more structured, with a distorted a-helix observed for residues 486--491 and a well defined dimer interface formed by the residues 476-481 of the so-called D-loop. The second finger, therefore, seems to change from a flexible unstructured peptide loop in the monomeric free protein to a structured one upon DNA binding and dimerization.

Fi& 3. Summary of the base contacts made by the Zif268 zinc" finger domain. The DNA is represented in a cylindrical projection.
In the present complex [6o.], the predominant specific interactions are those between arginine residues and guanine bases, but the fingers appear to be sufficiently adaptable to recognize other sequences. It is not yet clear, however, how larger arrays of zinc fingers bind DNA, as a continuation of the binding mode of 7Jf268 may present a severe topological problem. It may well be that the larger proteins such as TFIIIA use a combination of the arrangement seen in the present protein-DNA complex with o n e in which some of the linking regions (or even some fingers) traverse the minor groove in order that the protein might stay on one side of the DNA. Several proposals for such a ' i m p i n g linker' binding mode have been made [14o,22].

DNA recognition by the glucocorticoid receptor
From mutational analysis, several amino acid residues have been implicated in the protein-DNA interaction and (for GR) in the protein-protein dimer interface. The three residues Gly458, Ser459 and Val462 of the first a-helix of GR appear to be primarily responsible for target gene specificity [24-26]. Substitution of the corresponding residues in ER with these GR residues changed the binding specificity to that of the GRE [26] (see Fig. 4b). The complementary result was also obtained for an exchange of the corresponding ER residues in the con-

The GRE shown is the symmetrized version of the stronger binding half-site hexamer TGTTCT, as occurs in the consensus sequence. text of the glucocorticoid receptor [27]. Residues in the D-loop have been shown to determine the cooperativity of binding of the GR C-domain to GREs with 3 bp spacings between half sites [28-]. These findings can now be accounted for on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of the GR-GRE complex (Fig. 5), which confirms the essential features of a structural model of the complex proposed earlier [8]. As was predicted, the 0c-helix of the first module is inserted in the major groove of the DNA double helix and accounts for several specific interactions with bases of the GRE (Fig. 6). Furthermore, a number of hydrogen-bond interactions are present involving the DNA backbone, which are responsible for correctly positioning the protein on the DNA. These involve Tyr452, Tyr474, His451, Arg489 and Arg496. For Tyr452, this finding is in apparent conflict with the results of recent photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) experiments on a complex of the GR C-domain with a GRE [29"]. This study confirmed that Tyr474 is buried in the complex but showed that Tyr452 is still accessible to a photo-excited dye molecule.

GAL4 and related proteins

No detailed three-dimensional structures are available for the DNA-binding domains of this class of proteins. For GAL4, NMR [12] and extended X-ray absorption fine structure [13] studies have shown that two Zn 2+ ions are bound by the six conserved cysteines as a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster. An NMR analysis of a cloned protein fragment corresponding to residues 7-49 of GAL4 has yielded complete 1H NMR assignments and evidence for the presence of two cx-helices, although a series of consecutive turns could not be excluded [30].

For two members of the zinc-finger family, detailed information is now available on the structure of the domain itself and its mode of DNA binding. The two crystallographic studies discussed above attest to the important role of a-helices in protein-nucleic acid interaction and provide a framework for understanding how zinc-finger domains recognize their DNA target sites.

Binding studies using chimeric IAC9 proteins containing the DNA-binding region of PPR1 showed that not only the C6 zinc finger but also the 14 amino acid residues on the carboxy terminal side of it are necessary for specific DNA recognition [33"].

Concluding remarks
It is now clear that zinc fingers in their various forms are ubiquitous structural motifs used as DNA-binding domains in gene regulatory proteins. This notion has recently been reinforced by the results of a polymerasechain-reaction-based search method for CC/HH-type zinc fingers in eukaryotic genomes [34"]. An estimated 0.01% of the human genome consists of regions that code for this type of zinc finger! A picture emerges of an extremely accomodating protein domain, which can be used not only for specific binding to regular B-DNA, but also for recognition of damaged DNA as in the DNA repair enzyme UvrA [35] and in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase [36,37]. Furthermore, zinc fingers bind to RNA, as is well known for TFmA and also occurs, for instance, in the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein [38].
