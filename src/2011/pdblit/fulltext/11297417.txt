Toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) from Pseudomonas mendocina catalyzes the NADH- and O2-dependent hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol. The complex consists of an NADH oxidoreductase (T4moF), a Rieske ferredoxin (T4moC), a diiron hydroxylase [T4moH, with (R )2 quaternary structure], and a catalytic effector protein (T4moD). The solution structure of the 102-amino acid T4moD effector protein has been determined from 2D and 3D 1H, 13C, and 15N NMR spectroscopic data. The structural model was refined through simulated annealing by molecular dynamics in torsion angle space (DYANA software) with input from 1467 experimental constraints, comprising 1259 distance constraints obtained from NOEs, 128 dihedral angle constraints from J-couplings, and 80 hydrogen bond constraints. Of 60 conformers that met the acceptance criteria, the 20 that best satisfied the input constraints were selected to represent the solution structure. With exclusion of the ill-defined N- and C-terminal segments (Ser1Asn11 and Asp99-Met102), the atomic root-mean-square deviation for the 20 conformers with respect to the mean coordinates was 0.71 Å for the backbone and 1.24 Å for all non-hydrogen atoms. The secondary structure of T4moD consists of three R-helices and seven -strands arranged in an N-terminal R and a C-terminal RR domain topology. Although the published NMR structures of the methane monooxygenase effector proteins from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) have a similar secondary structure topology, their three-dimensional structures differ from that of T4moD. The major differences in the structures of the three effector proteins are in the relative orientations of the two -sheets and the interactions between the R-helices in the two domains. The structure of T4moD is closer to that of the methane monooxygenase effector protein from M. capsulatus (Bath) than that from M. trichosporium OB3b. The specificity of T4moD as an effector protein was investigated by replacing it in reconstituted T4MO complexes with effector proteins from monooxygenases from other bacterial species: Pseudomonas pickettii PKO1 (TbuV, toluene 3-monooxygenase); Pseudomonas species JS150 (TbmC, toluene 2-monooxygenase); and Burkeholderia cepacia G4 (S1, toluene 2-monooxygenase). The results showed that the closely related TbuV effector protein (55% sequence identity) provided partial activation of the complex, whereas the more distantly related TbmC (34% sequence identity) and S1 (29% sequence identity) did not. The 1H NMR chemical shifts of the side-chain amide protons of Asn34, a conserved, structurally relevant amino acid, were found to be similar in spectra of effector proteins T4moD and TbuV but not in the spectrum of TbmC. This suggests that the region around Asn34 may be involved in structural aspects contributing to functional specificity.

droxylation of toluene to form p-cresol (1). The complex consists of an NADH oxidoreductase (T4moF, 33 kDa), a Rieske-type ferredoxin (T4moC, 12.5 kDa), a diiron hydroxylase (T4moH, with a (R )2 quaternary structure, 212 kDa), and an effector protein (T4moD, 11.6 kDa). T4MO belongs to an evolutionarily related family of soluble diiron hydroxylases including other toluene, benzene, and xylene monooxygenases, methane monooxygenase, phenol hydroxylases, and alkene epoxidases (1-3). In all of these complexes, a small effector protein is required for catalysis (4-8). Since

Monooxygenase Effector Protein Structure and Function these effector proteins contain neither organic cofactors nor metal ions, it is unlikely that they participate directly in electron transfer or other oxidative aspects of catalysis. Therefore, it has been assumed that the diiron effector proteins form specific protein-protein complexes and produce conformational changes essential for catalysis. This assessment is supported by chemical cross-linking, spectroscopic, and catalytic studies (9-20). Structures have been reported for the effector proteins from phenol hydroxylase (DmpM) (21) and the methane monooxygenases (MmoBs) from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (22) and Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (23), all determined by NMR spectroscopy. The structure of recombinant DmpM produced in Escherichia coli has a R and RR topology with a relatively large RMSD in atomic positions originally ascribed to conformational flexibility and exchange (21). However, subsequent studies showed that recombinant DmpM expressed in E. coli requires a refolding treatment in order to assume a catalytically active form (24). Although the inactive form was deduced to be a dimer, the structural changes introduced by conversion to an active monomer during the refolding step are not known. By contrast, the MmoBs from two species of methanotrophic bacteria were found to share a different secondary structural topology, consisting of R and RR domains (22, 23). The compact tertiary structures of the MmoB proteins differ from one another in the orientations of the -sheets and the extent of contacts between the R-helices in the two domains. Here we report the solution structure of a fourth effector protein T4moD, the structure-based phylogenetic analysis of the entire effector protein family, the results of studies designed to investigate the catalytic specificity of effector proteins from the aromatic monooxygenase subfamily of diiron hydroxylases, and preliminary analysis of NMR spectra of two additional effector proteins from this subfamily. The structure of T4moD is compared with those of other members of the effector protein family. The phylogenetic and catalytic studies provide the basis for detailed examination of the protein surface and specific residue contacts required for catalytic protein-protein interactions in the T4MO complex and other diiron hydroxylases. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample Preparation. [U-13C, U-15N] T4moD was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) grown on a minimal medium containing [U-13C]-D-glucose (Isotech, Miamisburg, OH) and 15NH Cl (Cambridge Isotope Labs, Andover, MA). Details 4 of the expression and purification are reported elsewhere (25). Similar methods (to be reported elsewhere)2 were used in the cloning, expression, and purification of TbuV and TbmC. NMR Spectroscopy and Data Processing. NMR samples used for data collection under steady-state conditions contained 1.1 mM [U-13C, U-15N] T4moD or 3.0 mM natural abundance T4moD in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (90: 10 v/v H2O/D2O or 99.9% D2O), 0.5 µM sodium azide, and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Product no. P 27124, Sigma Chemical Co., Saint Louis, MO). The sample used in the hydrogen-exchange experiment was a 1.0 mM solution of T4moD prepared in the above buffer adjusted to pH 5.0;
2

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 12, 2001 3513 this solution was lyophilized and then dissolved in D2O to initiate the 1H-2H exchange measurement. NMR samples of natural abundance TbuV (3.6 mM) and TbmC (5.4 mM) were prepared in the same buffer used for T4moD studies. All NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on Bruker DMX600 and DMX500 spectrometers equipped with tripleresonance 1H, 13C, and 15N probes and three-axis pulsed field gradients. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained with the TPPI method (26) for homonuclear 2D experiments or with the States-TPPI methods (27) for heteronuclear experiments. Gradient pulses as a combination of x- and z- gradients at the "magic angle" (28, 29) were used for coherence selection and sensitivity enhancement, which resulted in improved suppression of the water solvent signal in all 3D NMR experiments. Experimental details are summarized in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. Solvent exchange of amide protons was monitored by reference to a series of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC data sets collected at 25 °C. Each HSQC spectrum took 30 min to collect. The raw NMR data were processed with FELIX95 (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). In most cases, the indirectly detected dimensions were extended by linear prediction. Typically, a 90°-shifted squared sine-bell window function was applied to each FID prior to being zero-filled, Fourier transformed, and phase corrected. All 1H dimensions were referenced to internal 4,4dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate (DSS), and 13C and 15N were indirectly referenced to DSS (30). DeriVation of Structural Restraints. Interproton distance restraints were derived from NOEs assigned in 2D 1H-1H NOESY (mixing time 100 ms) for aromatic ring protons, 3D 15N-edited NOESY (mixing times 50 and 150 ms) for amide protons, and 3D 13C-edited NOESY (mixing time 100 ms) data for aliphatic protons. NOE restraints were grouped into three distance ranges: strong, 1.8-2.7 Å (1.8-2.9 Å for NOEs involving HN protons); medium, 1.8-3.3 Å (1.83.5 Å for NOEs involving HN protons); and weak, 1.8-5.0 Å, respectively, according to NOE peaks intensities. An additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper bound of the NOE restraints for methyl protons (31). Pseudo-atom corrections were made for nonstereospecifically assigned methylene and methyl resonances (32). In addition, dihedral angle restraints were derived from 3JNHR values obtained from a 3D HNHA experiment. The  angles were restrained to -60 ( 30° for 3J 3 HNHR < 6.0 Hz and dNN > dRN, -120 ( 50° for JHNHR ) 8.0-9.0 Hz, and -120 ( 30° for 3JHNHR > 9.0 Hz. An additional  angle restraint of -100 ( 80° was applied to residues for which the intraresidue HR-HN NOE was clearly weaker than the NOE between HN and HR of the preceding residue (33). A  angle restraint was used for residues in R-helix and -strand structures, as predicted from the chemical shift index (34) and from NOE patterns characteristic of secondary structure. The  angle was restrained to -40 ( 30° in R-helix regions and +120 ( 60° in -sheet regions. 1 angles were determined from 3JHR-H values estimated qualitatively from 3D TOCSY-HSQC with a short-mixing time in combination with NH-H and HR-H NOEs from 3D 15N-edited or 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (35). The 1 angles were restricted to +60 ( 60° for a g+conformation, 180 ( 60° for a trans-conformation, and -60 ( 60° for a g--conformation. Hydrogen bond constraints

3514 Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 12, 2001 were identified from the pattern of sequential and interstrand NOEs involving HN and HR protons, CSI analysis of the slowly and very slowly exchanging amide protons, and the first preliminary structures. Peaks designated as "slowly" exchanging remained visible in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra 2 h after exchange of the protein into D2O; peaks designated as "very slowly exchanging" remained observable 12 h after exchange. Each deduced hydrogen bond was represented by two distance constraints: 1.7- 2.4 Å for HN-O and 2.73.4 Å for N-O. Structure Calculation. Initial structures were calculated by the hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR 3.843 (36) and refined by the torsion angle molecular dynamics protocol in DYANA 1.5 (37). For the calculations using X-PLOR, the following force constants were used: 50 kcal mol-1Å-2 for the distance restraints throughout all the calculations; 5 kcal mol-1rad-2 for the initial dihedral angle restraints during the high-temperature dynamics, and gradually increasing to 200 kcal mol-1rad-2 during the annealing stage. All calculations were performed on a Silicon Graphics (Mountain View, CA) Onyx computer equipped with 10 R10000 processors. The structure calculation proceeded in three stages. In the first stage, a lowresolution structure of T4moD was generated by X-PLOR, using NOE-derived distance restraints and dihedral angle restraints for  and 1 angles. In the next stages, hydrogen bond restraints and -angle restraints were added on the basis of the structures generated in the initial stage. During this stage, each round started with 20 structures generated by substructure embedding and regularization in X-PLOR or with 60 randomized conformers in DYANA. The 20 calculated structures from X-PLOR or the 20 structures from DYANA with the lowest target functions were used to analyze restraint violations and to assign additional NOE restraints for the following round. This process was repeated until all peaks in the spectra had been assigned and all violations were eliminated. In the final stage, 60 structures were calculated by DYANA, and of these, the 20 structures with the lowest target functions were used for structural analysis. The mean structure calculated by MOLMOL (38) from this ensemble of 20 structures was minimized by DYANA with 4500 steps of conjugated gradient minimization. Analyses such as RMSD, secondary structure and dihedral angle determinations, and preparation of multiple alignments of the T4moD structure were performed with MOLMOL and PROCHECK-NMR (39). The ribbon diagrams of T4moD and other effector proteins were prepared with RasMac 2.6b (40) and MOLSCRIPT (41). Sequence Analyses. Sequence alignments and inferred phylogenetic trees were produced using Biology Workbench 3.2 (San Diego Supercomputer Center, http://workbench. sdsc.edu). Primary sequences for the effector proteins were obtained from the following GenBank files: TbuV from Pseudomonas pickettii PKO1 toluene 3-monooxygenase, U04052; PhlN from Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 phenol hydroxylase, AF065891; BmoD1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa JI104 toluene 2-/benzene monooxygenase, D83068; TbhD from Burkeholderia cepacia toluene 3-monooxygenase, AF001356; T4moD, from Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 toluene 4-monooxygenase, M65106; TouD from Pseudomonas stutzeri OX1 toluene 2-/o-xylene monooxygenase, AJ005663; XamoD from Xanthobacter species Py2

Percentage identities between T4moD and other effector proteins were calculated using the program ALIGN and the default parameter set (4244). Multiple sequence alignments were carried out using CLUSTALW and the default parameter set (45, 46) and then adjusted by inspection of the available NMR structures. The phylogenetic tree was produced from the aligned sequences using DRAWGRAM and the default parameter set (47). Catalytic Studies. A unit of T4moD activity is defined as the formation of 1 µmol of p-cresol/min in air-saturated 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 298 K in the presence of optimal concentrations of the other T4MO components, toluene (5.8 mM at 298 K) and NADH (0.5 mM). p-Cresol was determined using gas chromatography and conditions published elsewhere (7, 48, 49). For NMR studies, T4moD activity was measured before and after data collection. In catalytic complementation assays, TbuV, TbmC, or S1 were substituted for T4moD and varied relative to fixed concentrations of the other T4MO components to determine the maximal possible stimulation of p-cresol formation. For steady-state kinetic analysis, the effector protein was treated as a substrate, and all other protein components of the T4MO complex, O2, toluene, and NADH were maintained at saturating levels. Rates were determined by linear leastsquares fitting of the time dependence of product formation in a manner similar to that described elsewhere (50). The data for p-cresol formation velocity versus effector protein concentration were fit to an equation accounting for the formation of both activating and inhibiting complexes of the effector protein, V ) Vmax [S]/[KM + [S] + ([S]2/KI)], where Vmax is the maximal reaction velocity, S is the concentration of effector protein, KM is the Michaelis constant for formation of the activating complex of effector protein, and KI is the equilibrium constant for formation the inhibiting complex of effector protein. The kinetic parameters and error estimates were determined using the statistically weighted nonlinear least-squares fitting routine SUBINO (51). Vmax-values are reported as turnover numbers relative to diiron center in the (R ) protomer of T4moH. RESULTS Status of NMR Samples.

from M. trichosporium OB3b was observed at concentrations exceeding 0.2 mM (22), while the NMR spectra of DmpM from P. putida CF600 exhibited numerous low intensity peaks (21). At the concentrations used for the NMR experiments (1.1-5.4 mM), none of the proteins studied here (T4moD, TbuV, or TbmC) showed these complications. NMR samples of T4moD were stable for extended periods at 298 K and exhibited the same ability to stimulate the toluene hydroxylation activity of the reconstituted T4MO complex both before and after NMR data collection. 1H, 15N, 13C Resonance Assignments. Sequence-specific assignments of the polypeptide backbone resonances were determined from 1H-15N HSQC, HNCA, HNCO, HN(CO)CA, C(CO)NH, and HNCACB spectra by matching intraand interresidue 13CR and/or 13C chemical shifts for a given residue (associated with a 1H-15N correlation peak) and the previous residue in the primary sequence. Representative results are shown in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. Figure 1 shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum for T4moD at pH 7.0 and 298 K with 123 assigned 1H-15N cross-peaks (95% complete) out of the expected 129 cross-peaks, which also verifies the overall quality and homogeneity of the spectroscopic sample. The backbone amide protons of Ser1,

Thr2, and Asn10, and side-chain amide protons of three arginine residues were not observed in the HSQC spectrum or in the data from 3D triple-resonance experiments. Other backbone atoms, CR, HR, and C, were assigned, except for the CR and HR of Ser1, and the six carbonyl carbons of His9, Gly14, Glu24, Asn34, Arg69, and Met102. Signals were not detected from the N- and C-terminal residues, Ser1 and Met102, probably because the two ends undergo motions leading to exchange broadening of the NMR peaks. The lack of detected signals from the HN of His9 and Asn10 was also probably the result of local dynamics. The carbonyl carbon resonances of Gly14, Glu24, Asn34, and Arg69 were not determined because the following residue in each case is proline. Side-chain resonances were determined from analysis of C(CO)NH, HNCACB, HC(CO)NH, HCCH-COSY, and HCCH-TOCSY data. Assignments for the side chains of the six Asn and six Gln residues were confirmed by results from the HNCACB experiment with the delay values optimized for amide NH2 groups. The ring resonances of the tyrosines, phenylalanines, and histidines were assigned by analyzing 2D 1H-NOESY and TOCSY in D2O, CT-13C-HSQC, and 3D NOESY-CT-HSQC and TOCSY-CT-HSQC data. About

FIGURE 2: Summary of the sequential NOE connectivities observed for T4moD. Bars indicate NOESY cross-peaks observed between two residues. The heights of the bars indicate the strength of the NOE. Also indicated are slowly exchanging (O) and very slowly exchanging amide protons (b) and 3JHN-HR values of <6.0 Hz (0) and >8.0 Hz (9).

88% of the resonances expected from the 901 side-chain atoms were assigned for T4moD. 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments are provided in Table S2 of the Supporting Information; chemical shifts for T4moD have also been deposited with the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank [accession no. 4560 (52)]. Secondary Structure. Qualitative analyses of the short- and medium-range NOEs, 3JHN-HR coupling constants, and slowly exchanging amide protons (Figure 2) served to identify the

secondary structural elements of T4moD. The pattern of the HRi-HNi+2 and HRi-HNi+3 NOEs with 3JNH-HR coupling constants smaller than 6 Hz indicated the presence of three R-helices (Val23-Ile32, Arg60-Leu67, and Met73-Glu77). Coupling constants greater than 8.0 Hz, characteristic longrange NOEs (HRi-HRj; HRi-HNj), and slowly exchanging amide protons were used to define the -strands. On the basis of these analyses, one four-stranded antiparallel -sheet (Asn12-Arg18, Thr40-Glu42, Tyr47-Glu53, Ser82-

An index of either -1 or +1 indicates a shift deviation from the random coil value of either greater than 0.1 ppm (1HR) to lower frequency or 0.7 ppm (13CR) to higher frequency.

Phe83) and one three-stranded antiparallel -sheet (Gly54Thr59, Gln86-Asp90, and Gln93-Tyr97) were identified (Figure 3). The location and the extent of the secondary structural elements were further supported by the analysis of 13CR and 1HR chemical shifts (34). The consensus results of the chemical shift index (CSI) of 13CR and 1HR in T4moD (Figure 4) were in good agreement with the secondary structural elements derived from other results. Tertiary Structure of T4moD. A total of 1467 interproton restraints were used for the structure calculation. These comprised 367 intraresidue, 424 sequential, 195 mediumrange, and 273 long-range NOE distance restraints and 128 dihedral angle restraints (78 , 26 , and 24 1). In combination with NOE patterns and the preliminary structures, 80 hydrogen bond restraints (two for each of the 40 hydrogen bonds) identified from the slowly exchanging amide protons were introduced at the second stage. At the final stage, the structure of T4moD was refined by DYANA with input from a total of 1467 experimental restraints (>14 restraints/residue); 60 conformers were calculated. Of these, the 20 conformers with the lowest target functions were selected to represent the structure (Figure 5). The magnitude of the average target function (0.77 ( 0.14 Å2) indicates good agreement between the selected 20 structures and the input restraints. For the defined region of the structure (Asn12-Phe98), the RMSDs to the averaged structure were 0.71 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.24 Å for all non-

Hemmi et al. methane, and propene have been included in these comparisons. Among the 24 effector proteins analyzed, the percentage of amino acid sequence identity with T4moD ranged from 18 to 58%. In the sequence alignments, a gap insertion of five to six amino acids was required to maximally align the sequences of the larger MmoB proteins with those of the aromatic hydroxylase effector proteins. Furthermore, a gap insertion of two amino acids just prior to 2 was required to maximally align the sequences of the phenol hydroxylase effector proteins and the MmoB proteins with those of the toluene/benzene hydroxylase effector proteins. With few exceptions, Figure 8 shows a remarkable correlation between the sequences of the effector proteins, their inferred phylogenetic relationships, and the chemical nature of the substrates oxidized. The only proteins that do not fit in well are PhlN, which is induced by and reacts with phenol (53), and TbmC and S1, which are part of enzyme complexes that react with both toluene and o-cresols (6, 54). Catalytic Specificity of Toluene Monooxygenase Effector Proteins. The following other purified effector protein family members were tested in place of T4moD in reconstituted P. mendocina KR1 T4MO complexes: TbuV (recombinant toluene 3-monooxygenase effector protein from P. pickettii PKO1); TbmC (toluene 2-monooxygenase effector protein from Pseudomonas species JS150); and S1 [toluene 2-monoxygenase/2-methylphenol 6-hydroxylase from B. cepacia G4 (6)]. The more distantly related TbmC and S1 were unable to replace the catalytic function of T4moD, whereas TbuV was able to substitute for T4moD in the T4MO enzyme complex (Figure 8). Figure 9 shows a comparison of the dependence of reaction velocity on the concentration when either T4moD or TbuV were used in standard T4MO assays. T4moD and TbuV each formed activating and inhibiting complexes of the type regarded as hallmarks of effector protein function (13). For T4moD, an apparent Vmax ) 3.4 ( 0.5 s-1 and apparent KM ) 2.0 ( 0.6 µM were determined from weighted nonlinear least-squares fitting (solid line of Figure 9), while an apparent Vmax ) 2.4 ( 0.2 s-1 and apparent KM ) 2.5 ( 0.4 µM were determined for TbuV (dashed line of Figure 9). V/K comparison shows that the T4MO complex has an 2-fold preference for T4moD relative to TbuV, with small changes in both catalytic and binding parameters contributing to the preference. T4moD and TbuV also formed similar inhibitory complexes with the T4MO enzyme complex, with apparent KI-values of 28 ( 10 µM and 32 ( 5 µM, respectively. Resonances from 1H21 and 1H22 of Asn34. The effector proteins aligned in Figure 7 contain a consensus sequence of Asp-Asn-Pro, with Asp conserved in 18 of 24 sequences and Asn and Pro conserved in all instances except one, where a Gln residue is substituted for Asn. In T4moD, Asp33, Asn34, and Pro35 are located in the loop between helix R1 (the longest helix in the protein) and strand 2. The frequencies of the Asn34 1H21 and 1H22 resonances (9.29 and 9.49 ppm) are 3 higher than the average of chemical shifts assigned to amide groups in other proteins (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/data·access/outlier·selection·grid.html). These Asn amide protons were found to be unusually resistant to exchange with solvent water; their signals were still visible in a 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum taken 2 h after a sample of T4moD sample lyophilized from H2O was resuspended in D2O. This suggests that the side-chain

and  angles to be in the most favored regions, 29.1% in the additional allowed regions, and 4.9% in generously allowed regions. Only 0.4% were found in the disallowed region. The structural statistics are summarized in Table 1.The structure of T4moD contains three R-helices and seven -strands (see the ribbon diagram in Figure 6). The first -sheet consists of four strands: 1 (Asn12-Arg18), 2 (Thr40-Glu42), 3 (Tyr47-Glu53), and 5 (Ser82-Phe83). The sequence between strands 1 and 2 forms a long helix, R1 (Val23-Ile32) and an unstructured loop region. The second sheet consists of strands 4 (Gly54-Thr59), 6 (Gln86-Asp90), and 7 (Gln93-Tyr97). The sequence between strands 4 and 5 forms two helices, R2 (Arg60Leu67) and R3 (Met73-Glu77). Helix R2 is in close contact with R1 as judged by eight NOEs between them. 5 is the final strand of the first sheet and has two hydrogen bonds to 1. Although residues Arg69-Leu80 including R3 are not well-defined, it appears that the side chain of Leu76 in R3 forms a hydrophobic interaction with that of Ile94 in 6. Strands 6 and 7 are connected by a -hairpin (Asp90Gln93). The last strand 7 is hydrogen-bonded to strands 4 and 6. The N-terminal residues Ser1-Asn11 and C-terminal residues Asp99-Met102 of T4moD are unstructured as judged by the lack of NOEs and CSI criteria for regular secondary structure. Figure 6 also shows the location of Asn34, Ile57, and Glu64, which will addressed below. Sequence Analysis of Effector Proteins in Terms of Structure.

The locations of the side chains of Asp33, Asn34, Ile57, and Glu64 are shown. The representation of T4moD shown in Figure 6 can be obtained from 1G10 by successive 148° rotation about the z-axis, -30° rotation about the y-axis, and 153° rotation about the x-axis. This representation can be transformed to the representation shown in Figure 11A by successive -45° rotation about the x-axis, 20° rotation about the y-axis, and 10° rotation about the z-axis.

NH2 of Asn34 forms structurally relevant hydrogen bonds. As shown in Figure 10, Asn34 H21 of T4moD is hydrogen bonded to Asp33 O (2.84 Å), while Asn34 H22 is hydrogen bonded to Ile57 O (2.26 Å) of strand 4. These interactions likely contribute to the compact structure of T4moD by linking the N-terminal R and C-terminal RR domains. Neither of the NMR investigations of MmoB reported signals from the side-chain amide protons of the asparagine homologous to Asn34 in T4moD. However, in the structure of MmoB from M. capsulatus, the comparable Asn65 H21 is within 2.7 Å of Lys84 O of strand 4 (22, 23), which suggests that this protein has an analogous interdomain hydrogen-bonding interaction. In T4moD, the carboxylate side chain of Asp33 is 2.9 Å from the guanidinium group of Arg60. Since Arg60 is located at the end of helix R2, this interaction provides another interdomain contact that may contribute to the compact structure of T4moD. Preliminary NMR Studies of TbuV and TbmC. Because of the unusual chemical shifts of the side-chain amide signals of Asn34 and the strict conservation of this residue, it was of interest to determine whether similar unusual chemical shifts might be found in 1H NMR spectra of other aromatic hydroxylase effector proteins. The NOESY spectrum of TbuV (effector protein of the toluene 3-monooxygenase from P. pickettii PKO1, which contains residues homologous to Asn33 and Ile57) exhibited cross-peaks at 9.12 and 9.28 ppm comparable to those assigned to the interaction between 1H21 and 1H22 of Asn34 and Ile57 1HN in the NOESY spectrum of T4moD.3 By contrast, the NOESY spectrum of TbmC (the effector protein of the toluene 2-monooxygenase from Pseudomonas species JS150, which also contains residues homologous to Asn33 and Ile57) did not exhibit comparable 1H resonances. These results indicate that the structure at

the conserved Asn group is different in TbmC from that in T4moD and TbuV. Since this difference correlates with catalytic complementarity in the T4MO system, it is tempting to speculate that the region around Asn34 is a determinant of this specificity. DISCUSSION Secondary and Tertiary Structure. T4moD, which consists of an N-terminal R domain and a C-terminal RR domain, has a topology similar to that determined for MmoB proteins from two methanotrophs (22, 23). This topology differs from that determined for what appears to be a partially folded form of effector protein DmpM, namely an N-terminal R domain and a C-terminal RR domain (21, 24). As noted in several contexts (21-23), the amino acids that define the arrangement of strands and helices in DmpM, MmoBs, and T4moD are conserved nearly universally among the known effector proteins (Figure 7). For T4moD, this includes Val13 in strand 1, the sequence of Asp33-Asn34Pro35 that immediately follows helix R1, Ala46 that immediately precedes strand 3, Gly54 that begins strand 4, Arg60 that begins helix R2, Gln74 in helix R3, Gly85 that immediately precedes strand 6, and Asp90 that ends strand 6. Thus, it is likely that the secondary structural topology of the effector proteins will be conserved. However, Figure 11 shows that the average 3D structures of the four effector proteins determined by NMR differ substantially from one another. In the following, we consider how various aspects of effector protein structure may contribute to this difference and discuss how catalytic specialization may be produced.
3 Spectra of TbuV revealed an addition 1HN signal at 9.67 ppm with an NOE to the 1HN of Ile57. The assignment of this 9.67 ppm peak is under investigation; an analogous resonance was not observed in spectra of T4moD.

Properties of the N-Terminal Region of T4moD. The diiron hydroxylase effector proteins range in relative mass from 10 to 17 kDa, with the major differences arising from the variable N-terminal region. The MmoB proteins differ from

the other 20 effector proteins by containing an extended N-terminal region (35 amino acids) containing a Gly triplet (GXXGXXG), whereas most members of the phenol hydroxylase branch apparently lack an extended N-terminal region. The structures of MmoB model this N-terminal extension as either ill-defined or weakly R-helical (22, 23). Proteolytic cleavage within the Gly triplet sequence has been shown to result in decreased catalytic function (55). Since the proteolysis apparently does not lead to unfolding or destabilization of the truncated protein (56), the catalytic impairment appears to be associated with a loss of ability to effectively bind to the hydroxylase partner. Whether the unstructured (Ser1-Asn11) N-terminal region of T4moD is essential for function has not been addressed in these studies. However, due to the overall lack of sequence conservation, it is likely that this region of the aromatic monooxygenase effector proteins will not be directly required for function. Side-Chain NH2 Resonances of Asn34. The NMR structures of the four effector proteins are compared in Figure 11. In T4moD (Figure 11A), the four-stranded and threestranded -sheets are roughly perpendicular to one another and have a "hinge-like" framework. The axis of helix R1 is parallel to the four-stranded -sheet. The figure also presents the hydrogen-bonding interaction between Asn34 and Ile57 at the apex of the -sheets and Asp33 and Arg60 at the upper end of the -sheets. In MmoB from M. capsulatus, (Figure 11B), a putative hydrogen bond between Asn65 H12 and Lys84 O and the hydrophobic interactions between R1 and R2 (described below) contribute to the similarity of this structure with T4moD (Figure 11A). In MmoB from M. trichosporium, (Figure 11C), the angle between the -sheets has collapsed to 70°, and the strands in the two sheets have twisted 30° away from the orientation observed for the corresponding strands in T4moD. Consequently, Asn64 is partially exposed to solvent, and there are no interactions between helix R1 and strand 4. In the case of DmpM (Figure 11D), the -sheets have opened to greater than

Hemmi et al. owing to rotation of the -sheets. Patterns of Amino Acid Substitutions in Effector Proteins. The structures of T4moD and MmoB from M. capsulatus contain differences in helices R1, R2, and R3. Helix R1 of T4moD contains three solvent-exposed glutamate residues (Glu24, Glu28, and Glu31). Glu24 of T4moD is substituted by Ala, Asp, Ile, or Ser in other members of the toluene/ benzene monooxygenase branch of the effector protein phylogenetic tree, by either Asp or Glu in the propene epoxidase branch, by either Asp or Asn in the MmoB branch, and universally by Arg in the phenol hydroxylase branch (Figures 8 and 9). Glu28 of T4moD is conserved identically in all but three of the aromatic monooxygenase effector proteins (each variant contains Asp at this position) and is conserved as Glu in all four MmoB examples (Figure 7). Glu31 of T4moD is substituted by other polar amino acids in the toluene/benzene monooxygenase branch (Glu, Gln, and Arg) or by small hydrophobics in the propene epoxidase, methane monooxygenase, and phenol hydroxylase branches (Figures 8 and 9). Functional Contributions of Helices R2 (Residues 6067) and R3 (Residues 73-77). Helices R2 and R3 of T4moD contain a substantial number of residues that are identical or conservatively substituted in the complete family of effector proteins. In addition to Leu63 and Leu67, which provide a hydrophobic interaction with helix R1, Glu64, and Glu65 are conserved identically in many of the aromatic monooxygenase effector proteins. Glu65 of T4moD occupies a solvent-exposed position, whereas Glu64 of T4moD occupies an unusual internal hydrophobic cavity (Figure 6), with the nearest contacts to the side-chain carboxylate being Leu76 H2 (2.4 Å), Ile94 H2 (4.3 Å), Phe71 H 2 (4.7 Å), Leu63 H2 (5.2 Å), and Leu67 H1 (5.2 Å). These latter two residues form part of the conserved hydrophobic linkage between helices R1 and R2. The sequence of MmoB from M. capsulatus corresponding to helix R2 through helix R3 of T4moD also defines an internal cavity with Ile92 in the innermost position. This difference may be associated with the orientation of R2 in the two proteins, as Leu63 of T4moD occupies a solvent exposed position. In T4moD, the internal cavity containing Glu64 is topped by a long ridge of solvent-exposed amino acids (Glu65Gly85, Figure 7). The cavity has entries on two sides. The entry on one side is contributed half by portions of helices R2 and R3, along with the intervening sequence between R2 and R3, and half by strands 5 and 6. The innermost surface of this opening is lined with hydrophobic residues, including Gly68, Leu80, Phe83, Ile87, Ala89, and Ile94, whereas Ile78 and polar amino acids Glu65, Glu77, Asn79, Gln86, Gln88, Asp90, Asp92, Arg95, and Tyr97 provide the outermost surface. The entry on the opposite side is defined by portions of strand 1 and helix R1 and by residues of the loop between them. This second opening is outlined by the polar side chains of Arg18, Asp21, Glu75, and Asn79, the carbonyl oxygens of Ala19, Gly20, Leu67, and Pro70, and the hydrophobic residues Leu22, Leu67, Pro70, and Phe71. It should be noted that several of these residues change charge or size in a uniform pattern in the sequences of the effector proteins from different catalytic subclasses of diiron hydroxylases. Figure 7 shows that a substantial number of the conserved residues in the effector proteins are located in the region of

90° and twisted so that Asn26 is completely exposed to solvent. Interactions between R1 and R2. T4moD exhibits NOEs from a hydrophobic interaction between the side chains of Val26 (helix R1) and Leu63 and Leu67 (both in helix R2). This interaction has a shape comparable to one "tooth" of a "leucine zipper" structure. These residues are identically conserved in TbuV, whereas other aromatic monooxygenase effector proteins have conserved subsets of two of these three hydrophobic residues (Figure 7). In the four MmoB sequences, the Val-Leu-Leu triad is substituted by (Ile/Val/ Phe)-(Ala/Val/Ile)-Leu. In MmoB from M. capsulatus, a hydrophobic interaction is apparent between the phenyl ring of Phe51 (helix R1) and a methyl group of Ile92 (helix R2). A comparable interaction between helices R1 and R2 is not present in the structure of MmoB from M. trichosporium,

Monooxygenase Effector Protein Structure and Function this cavity and the two openings, including all of the residues from M. capsulatus MmoB whose NMR resonances were reported to undergo broadening in the presence of the hydroxylase (23). Therefore, we propose that rearrangements of helices R2, R3, their intervening sequence, and perhaps more global shifts upon complex formation, may play an important role in catalysis. It is possible that these putative rearrangements can be readily accommodated by the presence of the internal cavity. Catalytic Complementarity. Uniform substitution patterns identified at several places in the primary sequence alignments can be correlated provisionally with differences in functional properties (for example, compare the primary sequence patterns in strand 1 and in the sequence between R2 and 5). We hypothesize that these changes may be matched by changes in the hydroxylase partners. Thus the protein interaction surfaces of each effector protein and its conjugate hydroxylase may have been optimized within a given organism by compensatory evolutionary changes. This optimization will likely result in minimal catalytic complementarity for effector proteins across the entire family of diiron hydroxylase complexes, despite the likelihood for overall similar protein structures and mechanisms of action. Moreover, since some of the species of bacteria included in Figures 7 and 8 contain more than one diiron hydroxylase with different substrate specificities under the control of a single regulatory system for toluene/benzene and cresol/ phenol metabolism (57-60), the ability of effector proteins to react with only their appropriate hydroxylase partner may have important physiological consequences. Prior to this work, the addition of purified preparations of both MmoB and reductase from M. capsulatus to an ionexchange fraction of the hydroxylase obtained from M. trichosporium cell extracts (61) was reported to restore catalytic activity. Although the results of this experiment were not definitive, they suggested that closely related MmoB homologues could complement each other under catalytic conditions. Surprisingly, this complementarity was obtained even with the differences in 3D structure now indicated by Figure 11, panels B and C. The present investigation of catalytic complementarity among the effector proteins from four toluene monooxygenases evolved to have different hydroxylation regioselectivities (Figure 8) shows that the various effector proteins have substantially different abilities to complement T4MO (Figure 9). In agreement with the diversified catalytic function, our preliminary NMR assessments suggest that differences in catalytic complementarity may minimally correspond to a difference in interdomain H-bonding interactions at a critical "hinge-like" region of the three-dimensional structure. Whether these changes propagate to other regions of the protein structure, particularly upon complexation with the hydroxylase, remains to be determined. However, a reasonable hypothesis is that changes in the orientation of the -sheets may correlate with rearrangements of helices R1, R2, R3, the internal cavity, and associated openings. CONCLUSIONS This work has provided a highly refined solution structure of T4moD, an effector protein from the aromatic monooxygenase subfamily of diiron hydroxylases. Evaluation of this

Biochemistry, Vol. 40, No. 12, 2001 3523 structure and phylogenetic relationships has given new insight into subtle differences that may contribute to function and to the variable catalytic complementarity of the closely related homologues in this enzyme family. We have noted a correlation between unique H-bonding interactions at an interdomain "hinge" point and the ability of different effector proteins to complement the catalytic activity of the purified T4MO complex. Furthermore, the spatial juxtaposition of a well-defined internal cavity and numerous conserved surface residues suggests a possible mechanism to accommodate conformational changes upon binding of the effector protein to the appropriate hydroxylase partner. The combination of catalytic and spectroscopic approaches developed here for the aromatic monooxygenase effector proteins should prove useful in further investigations of these important questions in diiron hydroxylase structure and function.
