INTRODUCTION Arsenical resistance in bacteria is conferred by the operons located either on plasmids or on chromosomes.1 The conjugative R-factor R773 isolated from Escherichia coli contains one such operon responsible for the antimonite, arsenite, and arsenate resistance.2,3 Among the five genes of this ars operon, the ArsC protein exhibited arsenate reductase activity by catalyzing the conversion of arsenate to arsenite, which is then excreted from the cells.4 Another ars operon, containing only the arsR, arsB, and arsC genes, was also identified on E. coli chromosome.5,6 The sequences homologous to the ars operon are ubiquitous in enterobacterial species,7 indicating that the chromosomal ars operon plays an important role in prokaryotes. Compared with extensive studies carried out on bacterial systems, considerably less work has been done on the eukaryotic counterparts. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a budding yeast, a cluster of three novel genes ACR1, ACR2, and ACR3 have been found to confer resistance to arsenic compounds.7 The hypothetical product of the ACR1 gene is similar to the transcriptional regulatory proteins and that of the ACR3 gene is a transmembrane protein. The ACR2 gene encodes a polypeptide of 130 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 14.9 kDa. The presence of the ACR2 gene is indispensable for arsenate but not for arsenite resistance.7 Its gene product overexpressed in E. coli was shown to exhibit arsenate reductase activity and comple-

ment the arsenate-sensitive phenotype of an arsC deletion in E. coli.8,9 The amino acid sequence of Ygr203w, a 148-residue protein in S. cerevisiae, shows a considerable sequence similarity to the yeast ACR2 arsenate reductase [Fig. 1(A)].8 It also shows significant sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of human cell cycle control phosphatases, Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C, suggesting that this yeast protein may be a close relative of the human Cdc25 phosphatase family.11 The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of Cdc25A revealed that it resembles that of rhodanese.12 In addition, the crystal structure three-dimensional fold of arsC arsenate reductase encoded by the E. coli plasmid R773 has been determined.13 However, little overall sequence similarity exists between the yeast ACR2 protein (or its homolog Ygr203p) and E. coli R773 arsC. Therefore, it will be interesting to compare the structures of these two families of arsenate reductases. In this report, we have solved the crystal structure of the 18-kDa Ygr203w protein at ° 1.9 A resolution. In addition, kinetic experiments show

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein production and crystallization

The ygr203w gene of S. cerevisiae was cloned into the expression vector pET-21a and overexpressed in E. coli B834(DE3) cells, as described previously.14 The recombinant protein contained six histidine affinity tag in the C-terminus. It was purified by metal-chelating chromatography, followed by gel filtration and Mono-S chromatography. Crystallization of the recombinant, native Ygr203w protein into orthorhombic crystals using a reservoir solu-

The phosphatase activity was monitored at 378C using a continuous method based on the detection of p-nitrophenol formed from p-nitrophenylphosphate (PNPP). Rates of dephosphorylation were determined at 405 nm in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 mM DTT, and PNPP at a concentration varying from 0.1 to 100 mM. The amount of p-nitrophenol released was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient e405 of 18,000 M21 cm21.15 The 1.0-mL reaction mixtures were monitored for 10 min. The assay was optimized with respect to time and pH. The optimal pH was

X-ray data collection and structure solution

° Collection of the native X-ray diffraction data to 1.9 A resolution at 296 K was reported previously.14 Ygr203w crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121, ° ° with unit cell dimensions of a 5 40.48 A, b 5 50.95 A, ° and c 5 91.95 A. There is one molecule of the recombinant Ygr203w per asymmetric unit. For the phase determination, the mercury derivative was prepared by soaking crystals in a solution containing 20 mM mercury acetate for 4 h. A crystal was mounted in a thin-walled glass capillary and the capillary was sealed with wax, after filling both ends with the mother liquor. X-ray data from mercury derivative were collected at 296 K on an imageplate area detector system (model 2030b, MacScience) with double-mirror focused CuKa X-rays from a rotating anode generator (MacScience M18XHF). Data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL program suite.16 Two mercury sites were located by interpreting the difference Patterson map with

The resulting electron density map was interpreted by the automatic model building program RESOLVE18 to build an initial polyalanine model, which accounted for 50% of the residues. Subsequently, the missing residues were built and the chains were traced manually using the program O.19 The model was refined with the program CNS,20 including the bulk solvent correction. Ten percent of the data were randomly set aside as the test data for the calculation of Rfree.21 Table I summarizes the refinement statistics.

single heavy atom derivative obtained by soaking Ygr203w native crystals in mercury acetate solutions (Table I). The Ygr203w model (148 amino acids) could then be entirely built in the experimental electron density map. The C-terminal six-histidine tag was modeled with four alanine residues because it is exposed to the crystal solvent space and is not clear in the electron density maps. Subsequently, the refined model contains 152 residues, containing extra four alanine residues in C-terminus, 90 water molecules, and one b-mercaptoethanol molecule covalently bonded with Cys90 residue. The refined model of the Ygr203w, containing 152 residues, gave Rwork and Rfree values of 18.2 and 20.5%, respectively. The refined model has excellent stereochemistry, with no Ramachandran outliers, with 91.0% of residues in most-favored regions, 9.0% in additional allowed region, and none in generously allowed and disallowed regions. A single Ygr203w molecule is composed of a central five stranded, parallel b-sheet (b1-b5-b4-b2-b3) that is flanked by five a-helices [Fig. 1(B)]. The Ygr203w has similar folding patterns to that of catalytic domain of dual-specificity Cdc25 phosphatase and is discussed later. In common with the other catalytic domain of rhodaneses and Cdc25 phosphatases, the Cys-(X)5-Arg motif in Ygr203w lies on a loop between b4 strand and a4 helix. The active-site residue Cys90 is the first amino acid of the active-site loop connecting the central b strand (b4, residues 84­89) to the helix a4 (residues 95­107). The active-site loop (-Cys90-Met91-Leu92-Ser93-Gln94Gln95-Arg96-) forms a cradle-like, semicircular structure centered around the Cys90 Sg atom [Fig. 1(C)]. The sequence and structural similarities among Ygr203w, Cdc25a phosphatase, and rhodanese suggest they be classed together as proteins of identical topology containing an active-site nucleophilic cysteine. Other proteins that show the same constellation of conserved amino acids probably also possess this same topology. One example would be ACR2, a unique eukaryotic arsenate resistance enzyme in S. cerevisiae,7 which contains a Cys(X)5-Arg motif. The crystal structure of Ygr203w shows ° an electron density map of b-mercaptoethanol, 2.1 A from the Cys90 Sg atom [Fig. 1(C)]. The presence of b-mercaptoethanol may be related to the purification protocol adopted for Ygr203w with the addition of b-mercaptoethanol. The Ygr203w active-site loop is structurally reminiscent of the phosphate-binding loop observed in members of the protein tyrosine phosphatases and Cdc25 phosphatase protein families. Although the Ygr203w was known to be a homolog of S. cerevisiae arsenate reductase ACR2, the Ygr203w protein did not show an arsenate reductase activity.9 To study the possible function of Ygr203w, we tested the phosphatase activity of Ygr203w. The phosphatase activity of Ygr203w-His6 was assayed for its ability to cleave PNPP. It was observed that the protein could efficiently hydrolyze this synthetic substrate at an optimum pH

value of 7.5. The corresponding kinetic constants, Km and Vmax, measured at 378C, were 3.5 mM and 9.01 lM min21, respectively. Although the phosphatase activity of Ygr203w (Kcat/Km 5 64.8 M21 s21) is low compared to that of the PNPP hydrolysis by low-Mr PTPases, where it ranges from 1.4 3 103 to 100 3 103 M21 s21, it is much faster than that of arsenate reductase (0.06 M21 s21). As described earlier, the three-dimensional structure of Ygr203w is clearly related to that of the Cdc25 phosphatase. In addition, the topology of Ygr203w is identical to that of both halves of the sulfur transfer protein, rhodanese. Rhodanese is highly conserved and is found in bacteria and mitochondria, although the exact biological role is still unknown. Rhodanese is composed of two domains of identical topology, but low sequence similarity, believed to be the result of gene duplication. Only the second domain contains the active site with a nucleophilic cysteine. It was reported previously that rhodanese shared with the Yersinia phosphatase an unusual loop conformation that directs eight sequential main-chain nitrogens in toward an anion-binding site,23 a structure which has now been seen in all protein tyrosine phosphatases. However, although the analogy between rhodanese and the other tyrosine phosphatases encompasses only the active-site strand-loop-helix region, the similarity between Ygr203w and each half of rhodanese includes all the secondary structures. When structural homologs were searched with the program DALI,24 the structures of ACR2 from L. major, Cdc25 phosphatase and glpE protein from E. coli showed a z-score higher than 12, indicating that Ygr203w protein structurally belonged to ACR2, Cdc25 phosphatase, or sulfurtransferase (rhodanese) family. GlpE is a prototype sulfurtransferase for the single-domain rhodanese homology superfamily.25 Analysis shows that the z-score between Ygr203w and As/Sb reductase from L. Major, ACR2 (PDB code 2J6P)26 is ° 15.7, and the root mean square (rms) deviation is 1.9 A for 121 Ca atom pairs. Between Ygr203w and human cell cycle control phosphatase, Cdc25A (PDB code ° 1C25),12 the z-score is 12.9, and rms deviation is 3.0 A for 124 Ca atom pairs. Between Ygr203w and E. coli glpE (PDB code 1GN0),25 the z-score is 12.0, and the ° rms deviation is 2.2 A for 103 Ca atom pairs. Other rhodanese proteins such as Rhobov27 and RhdA28 also show structural similarity to Ygr203w. Ygr203w catalyzes the phosphatase reaction with lower range as those previously reported for eukaryotic low-Mr PTPases such as bovine heart phosphatase, it catalyzes with higher range for Bacillus subtilis arsenate reductase. Similarities in the overall structure and the location of the active site residues of Ygr203w to rhodanese, arsenate reductase, and phosphatase enzymes suggest that Ygr203w belongs to the single-domain rhodanese homology superfamily and may be an intermediate between arsenate reductase and eukaryotic lowMr phosphatase.
