Ste11 is a MAPKKK from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that helps mediate the response to mating pheromone and the ability to thrive in high-salt environments. These diverse functions are facilitated by a direct interaction between the SAM domain of Ste11 with the SAM domain of its regulatory partner, Ste50. We have solved the NMR structure of the Ste11 SAM domain (PDB 1OW5), which reveals a compact, five alpha-helix bundle and a high degree of structural similarity to the Polyhomeotic SAM domain. The combined study of Ste11 SAM rotational correlation times and crosslinking to Ste50-SAM has suggested a mode through which Ste11-SAM oligomerizes and selectively associates with Ste50-SAM. To probe homotypic and heterotypic interations, Ste11-SAM variants each containing a substitution of a surface-exposed hydrophobic residue were constructed. An I59R variant of Ste11-SAM, disrupted binding to Ste50-SAM in vitro. Yeast expressing full-length Ste11-I59R could neither respond to mating pheromone nor thrive in high salt media-demonstrating that the interaction between Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains is a prerequisite for key signal transduction events.

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades mediate signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus in response to a wide variety of signals.1,2 In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ste11 MAPKKK3,4 and its regulator, Ste50, serve at critical junctions of pathways regulating mating, invasive growth, and high-osmolarity growth responses.5 Functional outcomes mediated by Ste11 and Ste50 depend on a net contribution of up- and downstream kinases,6 scaffolding proteins,7 and direct protein­protein interactions.8 Ste11 is functionally characterized by a C-terminal protein serine/threonine kinase domain and an N-terminal regulatory region consisting of several Ste20 kinase phosphoregulatory sites6 and a sterile

alpha motif (SAM) domain. Immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid, and NMR studies have demonstrated that Ste11 and Ste50 bind each other through a heterotypic association of their SAM domains.9­11 Ste50 has the hallmarks of a regulatory adaptor protein, with an N-terminal SAM domain and a Cterminal Ras association (RA) domain. Mutations in the Ste50-SAM domain that disrupt binding to Ste11 in vitro have been shown to affect signaling with varying degrees of severity.9­13 In S. pombe, a similar SAM­SAM heterotypic interaction mediates binding between the Ste11 ortholog Byr2/Ste8 and the Ste50 ortholog Ste4.14,15 The SAM domain is a conserved protein module consisting of approximately 70 amino acid residues.16 Since its original description as a conserved region in a subset of Ets transcription factors,17 SAM domains have been identified in inositol phosphatases, receptor tyrosine kinases, serine/ threonine kinases, diacylglycerol kinases, Rho GAPs, scaffolding proteins, and adaptor proteins.18 Chromosomal translocation events that fuse a portion of the transcription factor Tel encoding the SAM domain with PDGFRb and AML1, among others, create protein chimeras that demonstrate a high capacity to transform cells and are a hallmark

682 of many forms of leukemia.19­23 Mutations associated with ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasiaclefting (AEC) syndrome (or Hay-Wells syndrome) map to the carboxy-terminal SAM domain of the transcription factor p63.24 In addition to Ste11 and Ste50, heterotypic SAM­ SAM interactions have been documented for Tel/Tel2,25 Yan/Mae,26 Scm/Ph,27,28 and Byr2/ Ste4.14,15 Demonstrating the versatility of the SAM domain as a general motif for protein­ligand interactions, SAM domains also bind RNA29,30 and lipids.31 From a synthesis of the 12 SAM domain structures that have been solved (PDB codes 1B4F, 1B0X, 1BQV, 1COK, 1DXS, 1FOM, 1KW4, 1OW5, 1OXJ, 1JI7, 1SGG, and 1UQV), the prototypical SAM domain is characterized by a signature five helix (H1­H5) motif. From a subset of these SAM domains that have been solved in dimeric and oligomeric forms,28,32,33 three distinct modes of selfassociation are revealed. The EphA4-SAM domain dimer is defined by a lobster claw-like architecture with an interface involving the N termini of H1 and H3 in addition to the C terminus of H5.34 The EphB2 SAM domain oligomerizes through the interaction of two distinct surfaces defined by an antiparallel juxtaposition of H5 and an arm-exchange interface contributed by H1 and H3.35 The third mode of selfassociation is typified by the SAM domains from Tel and Ph, both of which oligomerize into an alternating arrangement of EH (end-helix) and ML (midloop) surfaces. Reciprocal interactions between H3 and H4 characterize the ML surface while the EH surface involves contributions from H4 and H5.28,33 With the exception of Tel and Ph, the biological relevance of these homotypic SAM­SAM interactions remains unclear. Here we present the NMR solution structure of the N-terminal Ste11 SAM domain in its monomeric form. Amide chemical shift perturbations arising from varying solution conditions map a homotypic interaction surface that is similar to the Drosophila Polyhomeotic (Ph) SAM domain. From protein crosslinking studies, Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains were observed to interact in a 1 : 1 ratio. The Ste11/Ste50 SAM­SAM interaction was further probed by individually substituting surface exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues on the Ste11 SAM domain with arginine. One Ste11-SAM surface variant, I59R, disrupted Ste50 binding in vitro as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assays. In vivo, full-length Ste11-I59R

was not able to rescue a ste11 deletion strain in response to either mating factor-induced G1 cellcycle arrest or growth in a high-osmolarity environment. From molecular modeling, we predict that the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains interact through complementary EH/ML surfaces.

Results
Ste11 SAM domain structure determination The Ste11-SAM domain protein fragment was selected for structural studies on the basis of sequence homology (Figure 1), limited proteolysis and successive N and C-terminal deletions. The resulting fragment of Ste11, spanning residues 15­ 92, was stable and soluble at pH 6.8 and high ionic strength (0.5 M NaCl) for several weeks. Comparison of 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra between Ste11 SAM [15­92] and Ste11 SAM [1­92] indicated that the Nterminal 15 residues were dispensable for proper folding of the Ste11 SAM domain (data not shown). At micromolar concentrations, Ste11 SAM eluted from a gel-filtration column as a monomer. However, at millimolar concentrations, we observed aggregation that was dependent on concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The solution conditions for NMR studies were chosen to be a good compromise of these extrinsic solution factors. Static light-scattering analysis performed with purified Ste11 SAM domain at a concentration of 0.8 mM identified aggregates and a monomeric peak at the expected molecular mass (data not presented). A similar analysis performed at a concentration of 3 mM identified an ensemble of monomeric, dimeric, and high molecular mass aggregates (data not shown). As a result, NMR samples of Ste11 were prepared as dilute as possible (0.2­0.7 mM). Based on a combination of NOE distance and torsion angle restraints, the solution structure of the Ste11 SAM domain was determined (Figure 2) with ° an overall backbone atom ensemble RMSD of 0.84 A (Table 2). Despite a low level of sequence similarity with other SAM domains, the Ste11 SAM domain retains the hallmark five-helix structure common to virtually all other SAM domain structures that have been solved. Fifteen unstructured residues, including the N-terminal His-tag, lead into the first a-helix (H1, 24­30). The remaining four helices (H2, 36­44, H3, 49­54; H4, 57­63; H5, 68­80) are bracketed by

683 solution. Ubiquitin, a 76 aa globular protein commonly used for NMR studies, is comparable in molecular mass to Ste11-SAM with a correlation time of w4 ns.39 With the software package HYDRONMR,40,41 we predicted a correlation time of 4.0 ns for the structured, globular portion of Ste11-SAM. Larger proteins tumble slower and, therefore, have larger correlation times. If a protein has a tendency to oligomerize, its measured correlation time will be longer and will reflect the populations of the species that are present in solution. From a global analysis of amide backbone 15N-T1 and 15NT2 relaxation rates, we initially determined the correlation time of Ste11-SAM as a function of concentration and ionic strength. With ionic strength held constant at a moderate level (0.15 M NaCl), we obtained a correlation time of 13.5 ns for a 0.7 mM solution of Ste11-SAM and 9.5 ns for a 0.2 mM solution of Ste11-SAM (Table 3). This result suggests that as the concentration increases, Ste11SAM tends to form low molecular mass aggregates. When the NaCl concentration was increased to 0.5 M, the correlation time of a 0.2 mM Ste11-SAM preparation decreased to 7.3 ns. Even under these conditions, the correlation time estimated by HYDRONMR is still significantly lower, suggesting that oligomeric species were still present. We expected some deviation between the predicted correlation time and our observed data, as the Ste11SAM protein used in the study has unstructured N and C-terminal residues that could potentially make its effective hydrodynamic radius larger than the globular portion we used to derive our reference parameter. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that Ste11-SAM is capable of selfassociation and is sensitive to concentration and ionic strength. From analytical ultracentrifugation methods11 the molecular mass of Ste11-SAM is overestimated by 40%. Moreover, the monomer­dimer Kd of 0.5 mM was noted to fit the data poorly. These

Resonances in the H4­H5 loop exhibit some line broadening indicating chemical exchange and/or slower motions relative to the overall molecular correlation time. Following the fifth helix, the remaining ten residues of the Ste11 SAM domain are unstructured. The hydrophobic core of the Ste11-SAM domain includes the side-chains of the following residues: F24, V25, F28, L29, I32, Y37, F41, I52, L55, L60, L63, V65, I74, S78, and F81.

results, combined with our own observations that the Ste11 SAM domain was sensitive to both concentration and ionic strength, led us to use the correlation time measurement as a diagnostic, rather than a quantitative tool as there would be considerable uncertainty in our estimations of the monomer, dimer and oligomer content in our preparations. For a detailed study of protein dynamics of a weakly oligomeric system (KdZ w1 mM) that is exclusively concentration-dependent, we refer the reader to a study of the 18 kDa low molecular mass protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP).42 To interfere with possible hydrophobic interactions between the Ste11-SAM and itself or its high affinity partner, Ste50-SAM, we produced seven charged variants of Ste11-SAM (I42R, V47R, Y54R, I59R, I61R, I68R, and L72R). From the structure of Ste11-SAM, each targeted hydrophobic residue was predominantly surface-exposed. 1 H, 15N-HSQC spectra of each of these variants was similar to wild-type Ste11-SAM indicating that all were capable of folding properly. Two variants (Y54R and I59R) demonstrated correlation times that deviated from those observed for wild-type Ste11-SAM (Table 3) indicating that homotypic interactions had been disrupted. On the basis of the criterion of correlation time, the I59R substitution appeared to be the more effective of the two at disrupting homotypic interactions. Both Y54 and I59 map to the ML (mid-loop) surface of Ste11-SAM. In Tel and Ph SAM domain structures, the ML surface is observed to interact with the EH (endhelix) surface of the Tel and Ph SAM domains. Using wild-type Ste11-SAM preparations at 0.2 mM and 0.7 mM, we performed an amide chemical shift perturbation analysis to further probe the Ste11 homotypic interaction surface. As chemical shifts reflect the local electronic environment of a molecule, they are a sensitive diagnostic of protein structure. From this analysis, we predicted that chemical-shift changes observed upon dilution from high to low protein concentrations would map the potential sites of homotypic interactions. Expressing the perturbations as the magnitude of the combined 1H,15N chemical shift change, we observed a total of 18 amide shift perturbations in excess of 8 Hz (Figure 3A). With the exception of F28, the most perturbed amide resonances mapped to the EH or ML surface (Figure 3B and C). Furthermore, these perturbations coincided well with the interface of a Ste11 SAM domain dimer that we modeled based on the Ph-SAM crystal structure (Figure 3B).28 Together, the structure-based modeling and mutagenesis data suggest that the EH­ML interface mediates homotypic interactions between Ste11 SAM domain monomers. As each monomer presents one EH and one ML interface, these results suggest a possible means of Ste11-SAM oligomerization. Moreover, if the EH/ML interface is the predominating mode of interaction, heterotypic associations between Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM

are likely to employ a similar mechanism of interaction. Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains interact heterotypically As a preliminary study to investigate Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM heterotypic interactions, we used a yeast two-hybrid approach. Specifically, we observed an interaction between Ste11-Gal4 ADand Ste50-Gal4 DBDSAM domain fusion proteins. Likewise, an interaction between Ste50-Gal4 ADand Ste11-Gal4 DBDSAM domain fusion proteins was also detected. We did not observe Ste11-Ste11 or Ste50-Ste50 SAM domain homotypic interactions using this system and negative controls using SAM domain fusions to either the Gal4 AD or Gal4 DBD alone were not autoactivating (data not shown). These results confirm a direct and specific interaction between Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM as was observed previously.10,12,13 We also performed GST-pull down assays with Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM proteins to analyze their interaction in vitro. Immobilized Ste11-SAM was able to capture His-tagged Ste50-SAM. The reciprocal experiment also demonstrated an interaction between Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM. This interaction appeared to be specific, as GST alone could not capture Ste11-SAM or Ste50-SAM. As well, GSTtagged Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM could not bind His-tagged EphA4 SAM domain. Similar to the

yeast two-hybrid studies, no Ste11 or Ste50 SAMSAM homotypic interactions were observed consistent with the idea that the SAM domains of Ste11 and Ste50 prefer heterotypic over homotypic interactions. We prepared several Ste50-SAM protein fragments for binding studies with the Ste11 SAM domain. One fragment, Ste50-SAM [32­107], was suitable for NMR and biophysical studies at pH 7.8 and 150 mM NaCl. Given the success of chemicalshift analysis at mapping a Ste11-SAM/Ste11-SAM homotypic binding interface, we titrated 14Nlabeled Ste50 SAM domain into a solution of 15Nlabeled Ste11 SAM domain and monitored changes with 1H,15N HSQC spectra. The reciprocal experiment was also performed. In both cases, we observed the disappearance of many resonances at substoichiometric ratios of titrant suggesting that aggregation was occurring in conjunction with line broadening at the Ste11-SAM/Ste50-SAM binding interface. Given the severe degradation in the quality of the HSQC spectra, we did not perform further analysis of these data. A similar observation had been noted in a recent NMR study of the Ste50 SAM domain.11 Chemical crosslinking and BIAcore analysis Given the difficulty of investigating Ste11­Ste50 interactions by NMR, we performed chemical crosslinking to determine the stoichiometry of the

Ste11/Ste50 SAM­SAM interaction. Soluble Ste11SAM, Ste50-SAM and Ste11-SAM/Ste50-SAM domain mixtures were incubated with 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for periods ranging from 10 seconds to 30 minutes (Figure 4). At micromolar concentrations and physiological solution conditions, the Ste11 SAM domain alone oligomerized readily upon addition of the crosslinking reagent. This observation is consistent with our NMR chemicalshift analysis indicating that the Ste11 SAM domain, like the Ph28 and Tel SAM domains,33 forms a polymer of alternating EH­ML surfaces. Ste50SAM, on the other hand, formed crosslinked dimers with virtually no higher-order species. However, co-incubation of Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM indicated that the affinity of Ste50-SAM for itself is much weaker than its affinity for Ste11-SAM, as all of the Ste50 SAM domain was sequestered into complexes with Ste11-SAM. At short periods of crosslinking, the predominant complex contained a 1 : 1 ratio of Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM. Over longer periods of crosslinking, the tendency for Ste11-SAM to oligomerize prevailed in the Ste11­ Ste50 mixtures, as indicated by the increase in the band intensity corresponding to Ste11!2/Ste50!1 and Ste11!3/Ste50!1 after ten minutes relative to the intensity of the bands after one minute (Figure 4). The dissociation constants of SAM­SAM homotypic interactions for the Ph and Tel SAM domains are 200 nM and 2 nM, respectively.28,33 The homotypic dissociation constants of the Ste11 and EphA4

SAM domain appear to be much weaker, both being around 0.5 mM.11,34 To determine the affinity of the Ste11/Ste50 SAM­SAM interaction, we performed a surface plasmon resonance study. Either aminoterminally His-tagged Ste11-SAM or Ste50-SAM was immobilized onto the surface of a commercially available nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-derivatized sensor chip. As a control for homotypic interactions, Ste11-SAM lacking a His tag was flowed over immobilized Ste11-SAM. A similar control was performed for Ste50-SAM. From the sensorgrams, we did not observe any homotypic binding for Ste11-SAM or Ste50-SAM, which may be explained by the limited sensitivity of the SPR method for affinities in the millimolar range. To probe heterotypic interactions, Ste50 SAM domain was flowed over immobilized WT Ste11 SAM domain or one of seven Ste11 SAM domain surface variants described earlier. Between His-tagged WT Ste11 and WT Ste50 SAM domain, we measured a Kd of 71 nM that best fit a 1 : 1 stoichiometry (Table 4). This result was confirmed by performing the reciprocal experiment (immobilizing His-tagged Ste50-SAM with Ste11SAM as the analyte). Of the seven Ste11 SAM domain variants analyzed, the I59R substitution at the ML surface virtually eliminated binding to Ste50. A Y54R substitution at the ML surface of the Ste11 SAM domain was less severe producing an approximate ten-fold reduction in binding to Ste50SAM. The remaining five Ste11-SAM surface variants had no significant effect on Ste50-SAM binding, including an I61R substitution for which

a full kinetic analysis was performed. Together these in vitro results support a model in which the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains interact by complementary EH and ML interfaces. An I59R Ste11 SAM domain mutant fails to complement a ste11 null strain To test the in vivo effects of substitutions in the ML surface of the Ste11 SAM domain that reduce in vitro binding to Ste50, Y54R and I59R Ste11 SAM domain point mutants were each introduced into the fulllength ste11 gene under the control of the ste11 promoter on a low copy CEN yeast expression vector10 and assayed for their ability to phenotypically rescue yeast whose chromosomal copy of ste11 was deleted. In S. cerevisiae, the high-salt responsive Hog1 MAPK is activated by the Pbs2 MAPKK. Since the MAPKKKs Ste11, Ssk2, and Ssk22 are each capable of activating Pbs2, all Ste11 rescue assays were performed in an ste11/ssk2/ssk22 null background.43,44 The ste11/ssk2/ssk22 (YCW340) null strain cannot respond to mating factor and cannot grow well in high-salt media.10 Full-length, wild-type Ste11 introduced to YCW340 could rescue response to mating factor and growth in the presence of high salt while an empty CEN expression vector could not (Figure 5). The effect of the SAM domain mutants on the filamentous branch of the pathway could not be tested in this strain, since the parental YCW340 strain rescued with full-length Ste11 would not invade agar in response to nitrogen starvation. Nevertheless, the Ste11 SAM domain mutations could be assessed for their ability to rescue both the ste11-dependent high-salt and mating factor branches of the pathway. Corroborating the in vitro analyses demonstrating that Ste11-SAM-I59R could not bind Ste50-SAM, yeast expressing Ste11I59R were not able to thrive in the presence of high salt (1 M NaCl) in either liquid media (Figure 5A) or solid media (data not presented). Moreover, these yeast could not respond to a-mating factor pheromone in halo assays (Figure 5B). Despite a ten-fold weaker affinity for Ste50-SAM, there was no significant difference in our assays between yeast rescued with a Ste11-Y54R and those rescued with

wild type Ste11. In summary, our in vitro and in vivo analyses identify the ML surface of Ste11 as a mediator of heterotypic binding, and indicate that heterotypic binding between Ste11 and Ste50 is essential for biological function.

Discussion
From Ca backbone alignments, the solution structure of the Ste11 SAM domain most resembles the Polyhomeotic (Ph) SAM domain. Consistent with the structural similarity, the Ste11 SAM domain presents surface-exposed hydrophobic side-chains in analogous positions to the Ph and Tel SAM domains and oligomerizes in a concentration-dependent manner. At millimolar concentrations typically seen in structural studies, other SAM domains reportedly have similar properties. For example, recent ultracentrifugation and NMR studies of the EphB2 SAM domain demonstrate that it exists in a monomer­dimer equilibrium.45 Analytical ultracentrifugation studies using the Ste11SAM domain, at pH 6.0, revealed a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a Kd of 0.5 mM.11 Mapping the Ste11 homotypic interaction surface by analyzing chemical-shift perturbations at two different Ste11 SAM domain concentrations coupled with structural modeling suggest an EH­ML head-to-tail mode of interaction (Figure 3). A similar approach was used to map the EphB2 SAM domain oligomerization surface.46 Our crosslinking studies (Figure 4) are consistent with the ability of both the Ste11 SAM and Ste50 SAM domains to participate in both homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Unlike Ste11-SAM, which oligomerized as the duration of crosslinking increased, Ste50-SAM crosslinked to a dimeric species. From in vitro and in vivo assays of Ste11SAM surface variants, the Ste11-Ste50 SAM­SAM partnership is mediated by the ML surface of Ste11SAM. Though it is not possible for us to identify precisely the stoichiometry of the higher-order Ste11-SAM/Ste50-SAM domain complexes in the polyacrylamide gel shown in Figure 4, we speculate that a head-to-head association between Ste50-SAM monomers, rather than head-to-tail, may explain

Figure 5. ste11 and Ste50 heterotypic interaction is required to rescue mating and high-osmolarity signaling in ste11 null cells. A, WT and mutant forms of Ste11 were used to rescue ste11 null cells (YCW340) for growth in the presence of low salt (light bars) or high salt concentrations (dark bars) or (B) in response to treatment with a-factor. ste11 null strains were transformed with an empty expression vector (EV) as a negative control or full-length Ste11 (WT) as a positive control. I59R and Y54R point mutants in the Ste11 SAM domain were also tested. Experiments were performed at least three times and data from one representative experiment is shown. The YCW340 cells used were also null for ssk2 and ssk22 to funnel high-salt signaling through the ste11-dependent branch of the pathway. Growth in liquid culture was assessed by measuring culture density at various time-points only culture density after 24 hours is shown here: 0 mg (right), 5 mg (upper left), and 15 mg (lower left) of a-factor was soaked onto Whatman filter discs for the halo assay. C, Western blot analysis using anti-myc antibodies to detect myc-tagged Ste11 from yeast whole cell extracts was used to confirm expression of the various mutant forms of Ste11. Anti-Rad53 antibody was used as a loading control.

this result (Figure 6). A repertoire of Ste50-SAM surface variants will be necessary to test this model. Given the nanomolar-level affinity observed between Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM, the formation of the heterotypic complex greatly outcompetes any homotypic complexes, if they are present. The physiological relevance of Ste11 and Ste50 homotypic interaction remains to be determined. Perhaps clustering of Ste11 by its own SAM domain may help maintain the enzyme in a repressed state in the absence of its high-affinity partner, Ste50. The association of Ste11 with Ste50 appears to be critical for effective signaling.

Our experiments to map the Ste11­Ste50 SAM domain interaction using mutagenesis coupled with rescue experiments begin to address the biological function of the SAM domain in vivo. The first in vivo study to address this issue10 showed that a SAM domain-deficient Ste11 kinase could not rescue a ste11 null strain for growth on high-salt or a-factor-induced G1 cell-cycle arrest. We have extended this observation by using structuredirected mutagenesis to identify residues in the Ste11 SAM domain that are involved in binding Ste50 and important for biological function. This approach yielded two specific amino acid

Figure 6. A model for the interaction of Ste11-SAM with Ste50-SAM. A, Ste11-SAM has two low-affinity sites (EH, ML) that enable it to oligomerize. B, Ste50 SAM has one low-affinity site that facilitates dimerization. C, At low concentrations (nano- to micromolar), Ste11-SAM and Ste50-SAM interact with high affinity through an EH­ML interaction. At high concentrations (micro- to millimolar), Ste11-SAM oligomerizes via its available lowaffinity sites and interacts with one Ste50-SAM through one high-affinity interaction.

substitutions (Y54R and I59R) in the Ste11-SAM that decreased or abrogated binding to Ste50-SAM in vitro. Residue Y54 in Ste11 corresponds to the L51 of Ph and L64 of Tel. Residue I59 in Ste11-SAM corresponds to H56 at the ML surface of Ph. Both of these Ste11-SAM mutations interfere with the in vitro interaction with Ste50-SAM (Table 4) but only the I59R Ste11 substitution, which has the most severe effect on Ste50 recognition, affects biological activity (Figure 5). Despite a ten-fold reduction in affinity, a Ste11 Y54R mutant was still able to rescue basic MAPK signaling functions in yeast cells. Two additional Ste11 SAM domain mutants (L22K and F81K) were designed to disrupt dimerization based on the EphA4 dimer interface. These mutants did not affect heterotypic interaction with Ste50 or the ability to rescue ste11 null strains in response to high salt and pheromone (data not shown). These data argue against an EphA4 SAM domain architecture to describe the heterotypic association of Ste11 and Ste50. Although there are only five known SAM domain-containing proteins encoded in the yeast genome, there are over 80 SAM domain proteins encoded in the human genome. Despite this significant representation in the human proteome, the precise biological roles of these SAM domains in mediating protein­protein recognition is largely untested. While aberrant SAM domains are involved in human diseases (i.e. McGrath et al., 2001), some physiological SAM domains may have subtle functions, as suggested by the observations that the SAM domain of EphA4 tyrosine kinase is not required to rescue EphA4 null mice in vivo.47 The relatively low level of sequence conservation among SAM domains at the amino acid level coupled with a high degree of structure similarity is consistent with the versatile ability of the SAM domain fold to mediate protein­ligand interactions, whether that ligand is itself, another SAM domain,

nucleic acid or lipid. Given the wealth of structural information describing monomeric, homodimeric and homooligomeric SAM domains, a foundation is established to begin asking how SAM domains function in heterotypic complexes and how SAM domains function in the context of the proteins to which they belong. Our future work is geared towards producing an exclusively heterodimeric Ste11-SAM/Ste50-SAM species for structural analysis.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid construction and mutagenesis
DNA encoding the Ste11 [1­92] SAM domain of S. cerevisiae was amplified by PCR from a cDNA template provided by M. Tyers. Restriction sites introduced by PCR were used to subclone the Ste11 SAM domain into either pAS2-1 (Clontech) as an NcoI-SAM-stopBamHI fragment or pGAD424 (Clontech) as an EcoRI-SAM-stopBamHI fragment creating an N-terminal Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) or Gal4 activation domain (AD) fusion yeast expression vector, respectively. DNA encoding the Ste50 [14­118] SAM domain was PCR amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA and subcloned into either pAS2-1 or pGAD424 using the same restriction enzyme sites as described above. N-terminal GST-tagged Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domain bacterial expression vectors were created by subcloning an EcoRI-SAM-stopBamHI fragment from the previously described pAS2-1 vectors into pGEX4T-2 (Pharmacia). Initial domain boundaries were chosen based on multiple SAM domain sequence alignments and further refined by limited proteolysis using trypsin, papain, and subtilysin. For structural studies, an N-terminal Gly-hexahistidine (His6)-tagged Ste11 [15­92] SAM domain was created by PCR amplification and subsequent ligation into the pET15b bacterial overexpression vector (Novagen) using an NcoI-SAMBamHI fragment. Similarly, a PCR product encoding residues 32­107 of the Ste50 SAM domain was inserted into pET15b as an NdeI-SAM-BamHI fragment.

Quikchange Mutagenesis (Stratagene) was employed to make a series of point mutations in the Ste11 SAM domain. Typically, mutations involved the substitution of a surface-exposed hydrophobic residue to Arg. DNA sequencing of the various Ste11 and Ste50 constructs was performed at the York University Biomolecular Core Facility.

using NOE and dihedral angle restraints supplemented with radius of gyration54 and delphic database refinement.55 Ensemble RMSDs were calculated with MOLMOL.56 Molecular graphics were produced with MOLMOL and pyMOL.

Protein crosslinking
Solutions (10 mm) of Ste11 SAM, Ste50 SAM, or a combination thereof were mixed in a total reaction volume of 20 ml in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 175 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. Crosslinking was allowed to proceed for periods of time ranging from ten seconds to 30 minutes and was halted by the addition of 100 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0). Untreated and treated samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

Protein expression and purification
His6-tagged or GST-tagged bacterial expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for overexpression. Upon induction with 1 mM isopropylthiogalactoside, milligram quantities of either the Ste11 or Ste50 SAM domain protein were obtained from 1­2 l fermentations in shaker flasks at 37 8C. Isotopically labeled protein was produced using M9 medium supplemented with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Higher protein yields were obtained using a BioFlo 110 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific) and a protocol previously described.48 Affinity purification of the Ste11 and Ste50 SAM domains was achieved using glutathione Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen) for GST and His6-tagged protein samples, respectively. The GST and His6 tags were removed by cleavage with thrombin (Sigma) as required. Protein preparations were further purified using an S-100 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 175 mM NaCl. Mutant Ste11 SAM domain proteins were expressed and isotopically labeled with 15N. Proper folding of each mutant protein was confirmed by comparison of spectra to those obtained from the wildtype (WT) Ste11 SAM domain protein.

Static light-scattering
Static light-scattering was carried out at 25 8C on a chromatography system consisting of a Shimadzu 10ADVP isocratic pump and a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a MINI DAWN static light-scattering detector (Wyatt) and a GBC LC1240 refractive index detector. The system was calibrated using bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Protein samples were prepared in 0.02 mm filtered running buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM NaN3), were loaded at 8 mg/ml, and were run at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/minute. Data acquisition and analysis was carried out using ASTRA software (version 4.0) as described by the manufacturer.

Surface plasmon resonance
Sensorgrams were recorded at 25 8C using a BIAcore X biosensor (BIAcore) with a nickel-NTA sensorchip. The chip was charged with 500 mM NiCl2 and regenerated with 0.1 M Hepes (pH 8.3), 150 mM NaCl, 350 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20. His6-tagged Ste11 SAM domain samples were serially diluted in running buffer (10 mM Hepes, (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Surfactant P20) prior to immobilization. The association phase was initiated by injecting 50 ml of Ste50SAM [32­107] at concentrations ranging from 25 nM to 800 nM over the control and active flow-cells. The dissociation phase was monitored for 120 seconds at a 50 ml/minute flow rate. The reciprocal experiment was also performed using His6-tagged Ste50-SAM and Ste11SAM [1­92]. Sensorgrams were corrected for non-specific binding and refractive index changes prior to analysis with BIAevaluation 3.2 (BIAcore) software. Three sets of sensorgrams were each fit independently according to a 1 : 1 drifting baseline model. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were determined from the mean ratios of kon and koff (KdZkoff/kon).

NMR Spectroscopy
NMR structural studies were performed using 0.2­ 0.7 mM Ste11 SAM domain samples in 10% 2H2O, 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 500 mM NaCl, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained using a combination of 15N-HSQC, 13 C-HSQC, HNCO, HNCACB, H(CCO)NH-total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY), and C(CO)NH-TOCSY spectra recorded at 20 8C using a 500 MHz Varian Inova and a 600 MHz Bruker Avance DRX NMR spectrometer. Intramolecular distance restraints were obtained from a 3D simultaneous 13C,15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectrum using a mixing time of 100 ms. Data were processed and interpreted using nmrPipe49 and NMRView software.50 No stereospecific assignments were made. 15N-T1 and T2 relaxation times were measured at 600 MHz using pulse sequences obtained from NMRFAM (University of Wisconsin, Madison) that employ a well-established approach.51 Using a script provided by P. Mercier (University of Alberta) for Mathematica (Wolfram Research), global correlation times of Ste11 and Ste50 were calculated from T1/T2 ratios. Correlation times were predicted from protein structures and models using the HYDRONMR software package.41

Two-hybrid analysis
Gal4 activation domain (AD) and Gal4 DNA-binding domain (AD) SAM domain fusion constructs were transformed into S. cerevisiae of opposite mating types BY388 and BY389 strains, respectively. Cells expressing various pairwise combinations of both plasmids were obtained by mating on XY plates followed by selection on the appropriate selective medium. Western blot analysis using either anti-Gal4AD (768, Santa Cruz) or antiGal4DBD (RK5C1, Santa Cruz) antibodies was used to confirm expression of the fusion proteins. Gal4DBD-Snf1 and Gal4AD-Snf4 expressing strains provided by M. Tyers were used as positive controls. Qualitative b-galactosidase filter assays were performed to test for interaction between bait and prey.58

GST mixing experiments
Varying amounts of purified soluble His-tagged SAM domains (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 mg) were incubated for one hour at 4 8C with GST-tagged SAM domain immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads. From 5­10 mg of GST fusion proteins were immobilized on the glutathione Sepharose beads. The beads were washed at least three times in ice-cold HNTG buffer (20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 150 mM NaCl). The presence of His-tagged protein was assessed using anti-His (Qiagen) Western blot analysis.

Halo assays
Response to a-mating factor was performed as described.59 Briefly, cells were grown overnight to saturation in the appropriate selective medium. Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into selective medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) agar and poured onto prewarmed selective plates. Whatman filter discs soaked with 0, 5, or 15 mg of a-factor (Dalton Chemicals) were placed on top of the plates and incubated at 30 8C. Growth arrest was scored after 24 and 48 hours.

Western blot analysis
For yeast, 200 ml cultures in log phase were harvested by centrifugation, rinsed once in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline and repelleted. The cells were lysed by vortexing in the presence of acid-washed glass beads in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml of leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml of aprotinin). Unlysed cells and insoluble material were removed by high-speed centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed using an anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10, Santa Cruz) combined with goat anti-mouse agarose beads. Western blot analysis was performed using the appropriate primary antibody in the case of Ste11, an anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal antibody was used (A14, Santa Cruz). Proteins were separated by SDS15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce).
