Abstract Tk-subtilisin (a subtilisin homologue from Thermococcus kodakaraensis) is matured from Pro-Tk-subtilisin upon autoprocessing and degradation of Tk-propeptide. To analyze the folding mechanism of Tk-subtilisin, the crystal structure of the active site mutant of Tk-subtilisin (S324A-subtilisin*), which was refolded in the presence of Ca2+ and absence of Tk-propep∞ tide, was determined at 2.16 A resolution. This structure is essentially the same as that of Tk-subtilisin matured from Pro-Tksubtilisin. S324A-subtilisin* was refolded with a rate constant of 0.17 and 1.8 min¿1 at 30 ∞C in the absence and presence of Tk-propeptide, respectively, indicating that Tk-subtilisin does not require Tk-propeptide for folding but requires it for acceleration of folding. ” 2008 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

1. Introduction Tk-subtilisin (a subtilisin homologue from Thermococcus kodakaraensis) is a highly thermostable subtilisin homologue from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis [1,2]. Like bacterial subtilisins [3≠5], Tk-subtilisin is synthesized in a precursor form, which consists of a signal peptide (Met¿24-Ala¿1), a propeptide (Tk-propeptide, Gly1-Leu69), and a mature domain (Tk-subtilisin, Gly70-Gly398), secreted in an inactive pro form (Pro-Tk-subtilisin, Gly1-Gly398), and activated upon autoprocessing and degradation of Tk-propeptide [2]. The crystal structure of monoisopropylphospho-Tksubtilisin (MIP-Tk-subtilisin), which is matured from ProTk-subtilisin and is subsequently inactivated with diisopropylphosphofluoridate, is similar to those of bacterial subtilisins [6]. Folding of Tk-subtilisin is almost fully completed upon binding of the Ca2+ ions to Pro-Tk-subtilisin and is not signif-

icantly changed upon subsequent autoprocessing and degradation of Tk-propeptide [6]. Bacterial subtilisins require propeptides for folding [7≠11]. In contrast, Tk-subtilisin does not require Tk-propeptide but requires Ca2+ for folding, although the refolding yield of Tksubtilisin is greatly decreased in the absence of Tk-propeptide as compared to that in the presence of Tk-propeptide [12]. Folding of Tk-subtilisin has been analyzed using the active site mutant of Tk-subtilisin (S324A-subtilisin) [12]. Its refolding yield is calculated based on an assumption that the protein resistant to chymotryptic degradation represents that correctly folded. However, a possibility that the protein resistant to chymotryptic degradation represents that, which is not correctly folded but is stabilized by Ca2+ binding, cannot be ruled out. In addition, it remains to be determined whether Tk-propeptide accelerates folding of S324A-subtilisin. Here, we determined the crystal structure of S324A-subtilisin refolded in the presence of Ca2+ and absence of Tk-propeptide. This structure is essentially the same as that of Tk-subtilisin matured from Pro-Tk-subtilisin. We also kinetically analyzed refolding of S324A-subtilisin in the presence or absence of Tk-propeptide. Based on these results, we discuss the role of Ca2+ and Tk-propeptide for folding of Tk-subtilisin.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Protein preparation S324A-subtilisin was overproduced in inclusion bodies, solubilized by 8 M urea, and purified in a denatured form, as described previously [12]. S324A-subtilisin¿ and S324A-subtilisin*, which represent a Ca2+free form and a Ca2+-bound form of S324A-subtilisin, respectively, were prepared by refolding S324A-subtilisin in the absence and presence of Ca2+. For this refolding, the solution containing 30 lM of denatured S324A-subtilisin was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at 4 ∞C for overnight or against the same buffer containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 1 mM DTT at 30 ∞C for 5 days. For purification of S324A-subtilisin*, the protein incorrectly folded was digested with chymotrypsin as described previously [12] and the solution containing S324A-subtilisin* was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM NaCl. The fractions containing the protein were collected and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM CaCl2. The further purification was done using a Mono Q column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mM CaCl2. The protein was eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of approximately 0.4 M by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 1.0 M. The fractions containing the protein were collected, dialyzed against 5 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 7.0), and used for crystallization.

3876 The purity of the protein was analyzed by 15% SDS≠PAGE [13], followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). The concentration of S324A-subtilisin¿ or S324A-subtilisin* was determined from the UV absorption at 280 nm on the basis that the absorbance of a 0.1% (1 mg/ml) solution at 280 nm is 1.47 [12]. 2.2. Crystallization, data collection, structure determination, and refinement S324A-subtilisin* (10 mg/ml) was crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at 4 ∞C. Drops were prepared by mixing 1 ll each of protein and reservoir solutions and were vapour-equilibrated against 100 ll reservoir solutions. Needle-shaped crystals appeared after 1 week using 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate and 20% (w/v) PEG4000. X-ray diffraction dataset was collected and the structure was solved by the molecular replacement method, as described previously [6], except that the ∞ 1.7 A structure of the mature form of Tk-subtilisin (Protein Data Bank entry 2Z2X) was used as a starting model. The data collection statistics and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Figures were prepared by PyMol (http://www.pymol.org). 2.3. Protein data bank accession number The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under ID code 2ZRQ. 2.4. Analysis of refolding efficiency S324A-subtilisin¿ was denatured by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), refolded by dilution, and the protein incorrectly folded was digested with chymotrypsin, as described previously [12]. For

S. Tanaka et al. / FEBS Letters 582 (2008) 3875≠3878 the kinetic analyses, the denatured protein was refolded by dilution and incubated at 30 ∞C. With appropriate intervals, the refolding reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mM EDTA and the protein incorrectly folded was digested with chymotrypsin at 30 ∞C for 10 min at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w). Finally, one-eighth (v/v) of trichloroacetic acid was added to the reaction mixture to precipitate the protein. The resultant precipitates were washed with 70% acetone and analyzed by 12% SDS≠PAGE. The amount of the refolded protein (S324A-subtilisin*) resistant to chymotryptic degradation was estimated from the intensity of the band visualized with CBB staining following 12% SDS≠PAGE using the Scion Image program. S324Asubtilisin¿ was used as a standard for this estimation.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Structure of S324A-subtillisin* S324A-subtilisin* was crystallized isomorphously with the needle-like form of MIP-Tk-subtilisin [6] in a space group of P212121. The protein molecules are tightly packed, as indicated by the low solvent content (35%, v/v). The asymmetric unit of this crystal structure consists of one protein molecule containing 318 of 329 residues, with 11N-terminal residues (Gly70Thr80) missing, 188 water molecules, and seven calcium ions. The overall structure of this protein is shown in Fig. 1. Comparison of the S324A-subtilisin* structure with that of MIP-Tk-subtilisin structure indicates that these structures are nearly identical with each other, with root mean square (rms) ∞ deviations of 0.12 A for 318 Ca atoms from Gln81 to Gly398 ∞ and 0.08 A for seven Ca2+ ions (Fig. 1). The relative B-factors of the amino acid residues in the S324A-subtilisin* structure are also highly similar to those in the MIP-Tk-subtilisin structure (data not shown). These values are calculated by dividing the B-factors of the residues by the average value of the B-factors ∞ ∞ of all residues (18.3 A for S324A-subtilisin* and 13.2 A for 2+ MIP-Tk-subtilisin). In addition, the seventh Ca -binding site (Ca-7) is stably formed in the S324A-subtilisin* structure as it is in the MIP-Tk-subtilisin structure. We have previously shown that the Ca-7 site is not stably formed in the unautoprocessed form, but is stably formed in the autoprocessed and mature forms [6]. Based on these results, we proposed that this site promotes the autoprocessing reaction. Thus, the S324A-subtilisin* structure is indistinguishable from the MIP-Tk-subtilisin structure, except for the mutation site. These results indicate that S324A-subtilisin is folded into a native structure in the presence of Ca2+ and absence of Tk-propeptide. 3.2. Refolding efficiency of S324A-subtilisin It has been reported that S324A-subtilisin is refolded into a native structure with a yield of approximately 20% in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 and absence of Tk-propeptide [12]. However, we found that this yield increased to 78% when the refolding experiments were carried out at 30 ∞C, instead of 4 ∞C (Fig. 2, lane 6). To examine whether this refolding yield is affected by the Ca2+ concentration, the refolding experiments were carried out at 30 ∞C in the presence of various concentrations of CaCl2 either in the presence or absence of Tkpropeptide. In the absence of Tk-propeptide, the refolding yield of S324A-subtilisin was nearly 0% in the presence of 60.1 mM CaCl2 and approximately 30% and 78% in the presence of 1 and 10 mM CaCl2, respectively (Fig. 2). In contrast, in the presence of Tk-propeptide, this yield significantly increased to 20% in the presence of 0.1 mM CaCl2 and P 90% in the presence of P 1 mM CaCl2 (Fig. 2). These results

Fig. 2. Comparison of the refolding efficiency of S324A-subtilisin. For refolding of S324A-subtilisin in the absence of Tk-propeptide, the denatured S324A-subtilisin≠ protein (15 lM) was diluted 100-fold with buffer A (50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM DTT) (lane 2), buffer A containing 0.01 (lane 3), 0.1 (lane 4), 1.0 (lane 5), and 10 mM CaCl2 (lane 6). For refolding of S324A-subtilisin in the presence of Tkpropeptide, the denatured S324A-subtilisin¿ protein (15 lM) was diluted 100-fold with buffer B (50 mM Tris≠HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM DTT and 0.3 lM Tk-propeptide) in the presence of 0.01 (lane 7), 0.1 (lane 8), 1.0 (lane 9), and 10 mM CaCl2 (lane 10). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 ∞C for 1 day, digested with chymotrypsin at 30 ∞C for 1 h at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w), and subjected to 12% SDS≠PAGE.

indicate that the refolding yield of S324A-subtilisin increases as the Ca2+ concentration increases and Tk-propeptide is required to increase this yield. 3.3. Role of Tk-propeptide and Ca2+ for folding Tk-propeptide functions as an inhibitor of Tk-propeptide and is required to prevent the degradation of the Tk-subtilisin

molecules that are folded later by those that are folded earlier [2]. To examine whether Tk-propeptide also functions as a chaperon, that accelerates folding of Tk-subtilisin, the refolding rate of S324A-subtilisin was analyzed in the presence and absence of Tk-propeptide. S324A-subtilisin¿ was denatured by 6 M GdnHCl, diluted with the buffer containing 10 mM CaCl2 by 100-folds either in the presence or absence of Tk-propeptide, and incubated at 30 ∞C for refolding. With appropriate intervals, the refolding reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 mM EDTA and the protein incorrectly folded was digested by chymotrypsin. The SDS≠PAGE analyses indicate that the amount of the refolded protein increases more rapidly in the presence of Tk-propeptide than in the absence of it (Fig. 3A). The refolding curve of S324A-subtilisin could be fitted to a single exponential process with a rate constant of 0.17 ± 0.018 and 1.8 ± 0.11 min¿1 in the absence and presence of Tk-propeptide, respectively (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Tk-propeptide exhibits a chaperon function that accelerates folding of Tk-subtilisin. It has been proposed for bacterial subtilisins and a-lytic protease that, in the absence of the propeptide, refolding of the mature domain from the denatured state to the native state requires a very long time (t1/2 > 1500 years for subtilisin BPN’ [4,5] and t1/2 $ 1800 years for a-lytic protease [14]). This is due to a high kinetic barrier between the unfolded and folded states. Consequently, this kinetic barrier ensures proteolytic stability of the native structure and allows extracellular protease to function in harsh environments [14]. Tk-subtilisin is secreted, folded, matured, and functions in highly harsh extracellular environments, because the host organism Thermococcus kodakaraensis grows even at 102 ∞C [15]. Therefore, the kinetic barrier for folding of Tk-subtilisin should be extraordinarily higher than those previously reported. To reduce this unusual high kinetic barrier, folding of Tk-subtilisin may adopt two chaperone-like functions of the propeptide domain and Ca2+-binding region. Indeed, four of seven Ca2+-binding

sites (Ca-2 to Ca-5) stabilize the central aba substructure of the mature domain and this substructure is also stabilized by the propeptide domain, as previously reported [12]. The stabilization of the aba substructure has been proposed to be crucial for subtilisin folding. In addition, in subtilisin BPN 0 , the conserved Ca2+ binding site (Ca-1) has been shown to be associated with the folding resistance of the mature domain [16,17]. The precise roles of each Ca2+-binding site are under investigation.
