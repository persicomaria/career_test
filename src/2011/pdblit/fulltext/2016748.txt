The structures of the deoxy and carbonmonoxy derivatives of the insect haemoglobin erythrocruorin have been determined by difference Fourier syntheses. In deoxyerythrocruorin the iron atom of the haem group was found to be five-coordinated. The carbonmonoxy- versus deoxy- difference map showed that the carbon monoxide molecule is inclined to the haem plane. Slight structural changes could be observed to take place on carbon monoxide binding. These structural changes are probably due to the difference in spin state between deoxy- and carbonmonoxy haemoglobin.

1. Introduction
The structure of the monomeric insect haemoglobin erythrocruorin has been determined by crystal structure analysis to 2.5 A resolution (Huber, Epp & Formanek,

1969a). This analysis aided by the chemical sequence determination
Braunitzer, tertiary 1969), permitted the construction of an atomic

be virtually identical, there are many differences in detail at the atomic level. It is especially noteworthy that many of the amino acids lining the haem pocket are different in the two structures (Huber, Epp, Formanek & Steigemann, manuscript in preparation. The analysis was carried out with meterythrocruorin crystals, which is the Fe3 + : H,O form. The crystals were kept in 3.6 M-phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. The haem group appears as a square plate in the Fourier map. The four pyrrole rings and the iron atom appear as partially resolved maxima (see plates I and II in Huber, Epp & Formanck, 1969b). The peak representing the iron atom is about 0.3 L% below a plane defined by the four maxima corresponding to the centres of the pyrrole residues. This shift of the iron atom towards the proximal histidine residue F8 is closely analogous to what has been observed in metmyoglobin. The haem-bound water molecule in erythrocruorin appears as a partially resolved peak of 0.53 e/A3 at a distance of 1.9 A from the iron atom. It occupies the sixth co-ordination position of the iron atom. Structure determinations of chlorohaemin (Koenig, 1965) and methoxyiron mesoporphyrin (Hoard, Hamor, Hamor & Caughey, 1965) have shown that in these molecules the iron atom is out of the haem plane defined by the four pyrrole nitrogens being shifted towards the ligand by 0.46 A. Furthermore, the haem group is puckered. The pyrrole residues are tilted 6 or 7" relative to the plane formed by the four pyrrole nitrogen atoms, forming a convex surface as viewed from the iron atom. We have

assumed that ferric

the haem group in the methaemoglobins has a similar conformation. Chlorohaemin, methoxyironmesoporphyrin and all methaemoglobins are high-spin
compounds (Weissbluth, 1967). From theoretical considerations of bond

lengths in high- and low-spin iron porphyrins, Hoard (1968) suggests that the spin state transition from high- to low-spin should be accompanied by a shift of the iron atom into the haem plane. Deoxyhaemoglobins are high-spin ferrous compounds, whereas oxy- or carbonmonoxyhaemoglobins have low spin. Ligand binding therefore involves a change in spin state. Possible structural changes in the haem group and its protein environment as a consequence of ligand binding are of interest, as they may be the trigger for the co-operative phenomena of ligand binding and the change in quaternary structure in tctrameric haemoglobins (Muirhead, Cox, Mazzarella & Perutz, 1967). We have determined the structures of deoxy- and carbonmonoxy-erythrocruorin. These forms and also all liganded ferric forms are isomorphous. We could therefore use difference Fourier syntheses for the analysis of their structures.

2. Experimental Procedure
Erythrocruorin crystals of the met-form were reduced in a 3.5 molar phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing about 0.1 g/ml. of sodium dithionite. They were transferred into Lindemann capillaries, all manipulations being performed in a large Schlenck tube under a vigorous nitrogen stream. Possible traces of oxygen would be absorbed by the high excess of dithionite. X-ray photographs of the crystals showed slight intensity changes relative to those of met-crystals. A few of the innermost reflexions showed large intensity changes caused by a salt effect due to the addition of dithionite to the deoxy crystals. These crystals were used for the intensity measurements on a Siemens diffractometer. Approximately 800 reflexions were measured from each crystal. Afterwards the goniometer heads were placed in a large vessel filled with nitrogen. The capillaries were opened and the nitrogen replaced by carbon monoxide. The same reflexions were then measured on the carbonmonoxy forms. The use of the same crystal specimen for measuring deoxy and carbonmonoxy forms excludes a large part of the error in the determination of the intensity differences. Having completed the intensity measurements, X-ray photographs were taken; these showed weak intensity changes compared with the deoxy form. Afterwards the crystals were dissolved to check the absorption spectrum of the carbomnonoxy derivative. The lattice constants of the deoxy and met forms were found to be identical within 0.1 per cent. In the carbonmonoxy form, the c-axis is 0.5 %, that is 0.17 A shorter than in the deoxy and met form. The same lattice constant change occurs in the cyanide derivative, a low-spin ferric compound. Three-dimensional difference Fourier syntheses to 2.5 A resolution were calculated for deoxy versuB met and deoxy ver8u.a carbonmonoxy forms. The Fourier coefficients used were of the form ( IF11 - IFzj) expiv, where IFI1 is the structure factor amplitude of derivative 1, and lFzl is that of derivative 2. q is the phase angle of the reflexion from the met form. Addition, loss or shifts of groups of atoms appear as positive and negative regions in a difference map. The magnitudes of shifts of atoms can be estimated from the peak height in the difference map, and the shape of the electron density distribution in the Fourier map.

3. Results
(a) Deoxy versus naeteythrocruorin The average background level in this difference map, measured in the interstitial region between molecules, is O-038 e/A3. The most prominent feature is a minimum just at the position of the haem-bound

water molecule in the Fourier map (Fig. 1). Its height is 0.30 e/A3, that is, approximately one-half the height of the water peak in the Fourier map (053 e/A3), as would be expected if the water molecule is completely lost. Deoxyerythrocruorin therefore has penta-co-ordinate iron, closely analogous to whale deoxymyoglobin (Nobbs, Watson & Kendrew, 1966). There are two positive peaks with a height of 0.30 e/A3 in the map ; one in the vicinity of the NH,+ group of the aminoterminal leucine NA 3, and the other near the imidazole ring of histidine GZ. All further peaks higher than O-2 e/A3 also lie at the molecular surface. These peaks suggest an additional (partial) binding of salt ions or water molecules in the deoxy form. We believe that these effects are due to the different salt solutions in which met and deoxy forms are kept, and that they have no connection with the ligand state of the iron atom. (b) C'arbonmonoxy versus deoxy form

The average background level in this difference map is O-029e/A3. This figure should be compared with 0.038 e/A3 for the deoxy versus met difference map, and it reflects the greater accuracy of the intensity differences due to the use of the same crystal specimen for both measurements. Figure 2 shows one section through the difference map at z = 401120. The positive peak of height 0.43 e/A3 represents the carbon monoxide molecule. Nowhere on this section, except at the position of the carbon monoxide molecule and in the vicinity of it, is the density greater than one contour line (line separation 0.067 e/A3). Only features having a density above or just below three contour lines (O-20 e/A") justify interpretation. There are only three peaks in the map just reaching two contour lines and no attempt has been made to interpret them. The most prominent feature in the difference map is the peak of 0.43 elA3, representing the carbon monoxide molecule (Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows several sections through the difference map stacked on top of each other. The sections were cut perpendicular to a line joining the centres of the two vinyl-substituted pyrrole rings of the haem group. The haem group appears as a line in this view, the vinyl-substituted pyrrole rings being on the left. The iron atom must be imagined to be a little below the centre of the haem group. There are several positive and negative regions above and below the haem group and near the iron atom, and these will be discussed in detail later. The position of the iron-bound atom of the carbon monoxide molecule is indicated by two arrows; it can be deduced from the position of the haem-bound water molecule in meterythrocruorin. It may be readily seen that the carbon monoxide molecule is represented by an elongated density region inclined to the haem plane. It points approximately between the vinyl-substituted pyrrole residues. The angle Fe-AI-A2, where Al and A2 represent the two atoms of the carbon monoxide molecule, is about 145O&15". Figure 4 is a composite drawing of sections at z = 36 to 401120, in the neighbourhood of the haem group. The direction of projection is nearly perpendicular to the haem group, which is outlined in green. The carbon monoxide molecule can be seen on these sections. There is negative density just above the position of the two vinylsubstituted pyrrole residues, which are situated at z = 361120. Corresponding positive density can be observed on Figure 5, which represents the sections at z = 28 to 341120. These density gradients must be interpreted as a shift of the pyrrole rings

towards lower values of z by approximately 0.3 A. The resolution is not high enough to differentiate between individual atoms in these groups; however, the shape and height of the difference densities indicate that probably all atoms of the two pyrrole rings are involved in the shift. Figure 5 also shows high positive and negative densities (0.23 e/As) near the iron site at the centreof the haem group. The iron moves by approximatelyO.2A on carbon monoxide binding. The same density gradient at the iron site is shown in Figure 3 from a perpendicular point of view; it is inclined to the haem plane by about 20 to 30". A further density gradient is observed in Figure 5 near the methyl group of the propionate-substituted pyrrole ring near helix E. Interpretation is difficult, as no other atoms of this pyrrole ring seem to be involved in a shift; however a possible connection with the iron shift will be discussed later. There is a density gradient at the position of the Cy and CS atoms of isoleucine E 11 (Fig. 6) indicating a shift of about 0.4 A. The atomic model shows that these atoms are very close to the carbon monoxide molecule. A rotation of the side chain around the Ca-Cfl bond would ease these close contacts and could explain the observed densities. There is a further region of high negative density nearby. It is very near the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of glutamic acid E 7, and may indicate a change in the position of this atom. The distance between CS of Ile E 11 and the carbony1 oxygen atom is only about 35 A, so that a shift of Cy and CS of E 11 might influence its position. The observations would be consistent with a shift of the carbony1 oxygen atom by about O-4A towards the helix axis, caused by a slight rotation of the peptide group. No corresponding positive density can be observed, but this might be obscured by corresponding small changes of neighbouring main chain atoms. There is a further density gradient at the Cc atom phenylalanine H 14. This atom is less than 3.5 A from the vinyl group of the pyrrole ring near helix E. The abovementioned shift of this pyrrole residue, would bring them in even closer contact, and a shift of the phenyl ring is therefore to be expected.

4. Discussion
All observations previously made on iron carbonyl compounds have indicated that the Fe-GO group is nearly linear, deviations amounting to only a few degrees. On the other hand, we have found the carbon monoxide molecule inclined to the haem plane (Fe-Al-A2 :145"+15") and pointing between the two vinyl-substituted pyrrole rings; The carbon monoxide binding angle appears to lie between 180" and the 120" observed for the azide ion and the oxygen molecule in sperm whale myoglobin Stryer, Kendrew & Watson, 1964; Watson & Nobbs, 1968) and for the thiocyanate ion in erythrocruorin (Huber et al., 1969a). An explanation could be sought in sterical restrictions imposed by isoleucine E 11, since its Cy and CS atoms would be only about 2 A away from the second atom of the carbon monoxide molecule if the latter were perpendicular to the haem group. Even bending of the Fe-Al-A2 group is not suficient to avoid close contacts with isoleucine E 11, as shown by the observed shift of its Cy and CS atoms. The difference map of deoxy versus meterythrocruorin shows that the sixth COordination position of the iron atom is vacant in deoxy erythrocruorin. There is no indication of a shift or a conformational change of the haem group or of amino-acid side chains lining the haem pocket. Changes in position of more than 0.2 A for light atom groups or 0.1 A for the iron atom would have been detected. Furthermore, there

is no difference in lattice constants between the met and deoxy forms. Such a lattice constant change accompanies carbon monoxide binding, and is probably a sensitive indicator of the structural changes induced by this ligand, as will be discussed below. The carbon monoxide deoxy difference map shows a shift of both vinyl-substituted pyrrole residues of the haem group perpendicular to the haem plane to lower z, that is towards helix F. It might be interpreted as a change in puckering of the haem group towards a more planar conformation, if we assume that the conformation of the haem group in deoxy-erythrocruorin is similar to that found for chlorohaemin. It could also be explained by a slight rotation of the whole haem group around a line joining the centres of the two propionate-substituted pyrrole residues. It would be expected that only shifts of those groups of atoms farthest away from the rotation axis would be detected. The iron atom moves towards the haem plane. However, the gradient is by no means perpendicular to it, but inclined by approximately 20 to 30". As the total shift is about 0.2 A, the components perpendicular to the haem plane and parallel to it a,reabout 0.10 A and 0.15 A respectively. As a shift of the iron atom off the symmetry axis of the haem group by 0.15 A seems highly improbable, we may assume that the haem group moves as a whole. Such a shift brings the haem group deeper into the pocket; it also helps to relax the close contact between the bound carbon monoxide molecule and isoleucine E 11. A number of indications in the difference map support this interpretation. The gradient at the methyl group of the propionate-substituted pyrrole residue described above has the expected direction. There are further density gradients at the methyl groups of the second propionate-substituted, and of one of the vinyl-substituted, pyrrole residues (Fig. 5). These two gradients are below our chosen significance level, but nevertheless confirm our interpretation. Furthermore, by comparing Figures 4 and 5, it can readily be seen that the positive density related to the perpendicular shift of the pyrrole ring is also shifted with respect to the negative density. The perpendicular component of the iron shift and the perpendicular shift of the vinyl-substituted pyrrole rings have opposite directions, and therefore bring the iron atom towards the haem plane by the sum of 0.15 A (one half of the pyrrole shifts) and 0.10 A (iron shift). The iron atom therefore appears to be very nearly co-planar with the haem group in the carbon monoxide complex. The observed shifts of some atoms of the side chains of Ile E 11 and Phe H 14 can easily be explained as consequences of the movement of the haem group and the presence of the carbon monoxide molecule. We are convinced that there are further shifts of side chains in contact with the vinyl-substituted pyrrole rings (Val FG 5, Ile C 4, His F 8, Phe F 4, Phe G 8 in particular), which remain unobserved because they are too small to be detected. For example, we do not believe that the covalent bond of the iron atom to the NE atom of histidine F 8 could be lengthened by 0.2 A upon ligand binding. A small shift of this residue and a consequent rearrangement of helix Fare to be expected, but are either below the limits of the method or obscured by corresponding changes in neighbouring groups. In fact, the change of lattice constant by 0.17 A of the deoxy form upon carbon monoxide binding proves that the structural changes at and near the haem group are transmitted to the molecular surface. Even the direction and sense of the lattice constant change can be explained simply. Erythrocruorin crystallizes with a c-lattice constant of 35.4 A, and this is just the molecular diameter from helix F to the GH

interhelical region. As the haem groups lie nearly perpendicular to c, this axis may be expected to shrink if the iron atom moves towards the haem plane. There is no difference in lattice constant between the deoxy and met forms. However, substitution of the haem-bound water molecule in the met form by cyanide, which involves a transition from high-spin to low-spin Fe3+, produces a change in lattice constant identical to that noted above. We therefore believe that the structural change that we have described is caused by the transition of the spin state of the iron atom. It is apparently independent of the valence state of the iron atom. We can at present see no correlation between the structural change observed here, and the change in quaternary structure on ligand binding and the co-operative phenomena observed in tetrameric haemoglobins. The reason for this lies mainly in two facts. First all liganded forms of the tetrameric haemoglobins have identical quaternary structures: the same quaternary structural change takes place on going from deoxy haemoglobin to any liganded haemoglobin, regardless of valence and spin-state of the iron (Perutz, 1968). Second, the shape of the oxidation-reduction equilibrium curve indicates a co-operative behaviour similar to oxygen binding in tetrameric haemoglobins (Taylor & Hastings, 1939; Antonini et. al., 1964). We believe that the structural change in the haem group observed here is a phenomenon common to all haemoglobins, although it has not been described for oxy and azide myoglobin, two low-spin compounds; perhaps because the accuracy of the intensity differences for the erythrocruorin derivatives is greater than that obtained with myoglobin owing to experimental difficulties in particular for oxy myoglobin. However, we also believe that the corresponding changes in the protein moiety are different for various haemoglobins, mainly owing to differences in amino-acid composition.
