ABSTRACT Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) is currently exploited as a target for inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis under high glucose conditions. Spirohydantoin of glucopyranose and N-acetyl- -D-glucopyranosylamine have been identified as the most potent inhibitors of GP that bind at the catalytic site. Four spirohydantoin and three -D-glucopyranosylamine analogs have been designed, synthesized and tested for inhibition of GP in kinetic experiments. Depending on the functional group introduced, the Ki values varied from 16.5 M to 1200 M. In order to rationalize the kinetic results, we determined the crystal structures of the analogs in complex with GP. All the inhibitors bound at the catalytic site of the enzyme, by making direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the protein and by inducing minor movements of the side chains of Asp283 and Asn284, of the 280s loop that blocks access of the substrate glycogen to the catalytic site, and changes in the water structure in the vicinity of the site. The differences observed in the Ki values of the analogs can be interpreted in terms of variations in hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, desolvation effects, ligand conformational entropy, and displacement of water molecules on ligand binding to the catalytic site.

It is known that the liver is mainly responsible for the elevated rates of glucose during the process of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.4 ­7 Several potential therapeutic targets that are involved in these pathways comprise the glucagon receptor (antagonists) and many more regulatory enzymes such as fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (inhibitors), glycogen phos-

phorylase (inhibitors), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (inhibitors), glucokinase (activators), glucose-6-phosphatase (inhibitors), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (inhibitors), and protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (inhibitors).1,4,6 ­15 As part of a long-term study in identifying inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), aimed at reducing excessive glucose production, we have focused on the three-dimensional structure of rabbit muscle GP as a model for structure-based design of inhibitors.9,11 In particular, the catalytic site of GP has been investigated using glucose and glucose analogs. Although glucose is a natural regulator of GP that binds to the catalytic site and stabilizes the inactive T state, it is a poor inhibitor (Ki 1.7 and 7.4 mM, for - and -D-glucose, respectively).16 Substitution at the anomeric C1 position of glucose in either the - or the -orientation, has produced several inhibitors of GP with varying degrees of affinity (from mM to M). Several of these analogs were shown to bind favorably to GP with affinities, for the T state, of up to three orders of magnitude better than the parent glucose moiety.17­19 In addition, some of these compounds were shown to exhibit a positive hypoglycemic effect by maintaining tighter control over the activities of GP and glycogen synthase.20,21 The present work is based on the knowledge derived from former systematic kinetic and crystallographic studies of structurally similar compounds such as -anhydroglucoheptonic acids and N-acyl derivatives of -D-glucopyranosylamine, of which -D-glucoheptonamide (Ki 0.37 mM) and N-acetyl- -D-glucopyranosylamine (Ki 32 M) were exceptional, and one heterocyclic compound, the spirohydantoin of glucopyranose (Ki 3.1 M), which is 550-times better inhibitor than -D-glucose. Starting with these core structures, eight new compounds were designed, synthesized, and studied by kinetic and X-ray crystallographic methods. As predicted, these analogs bound at the catalytic site of GP. The analyses of the molecular interactions of the bound GP-ligand complexes provide a rationale for the different kinetic properties of the inhibitors (see also Archontis et al. 2005).22 MATERIALS AND METHODS Chemicals AMP, Glc-1-P (dipotassium salt) and oyster glycogen, were obtained from Sigma chemical company and used without further purification. Oyster glycogen was freed of AMP according to Helmreich and Cori.23 Synthesis The synthesis of compound 1 (Table I) is described by Bichard et al. (1995)17 and Krulle et al. (1997),24 while the ¨ synthesis of compounds 2­5 is described in Krulle et al. ¨ (1997).17,24 Compounds 9 and 10 were synthesized according to Dromowicz and Koll (1988)25 and Nondera and Kitaoka (1960)26, respectively. The synthesis of compounds 6 ­ 8 will be published elsewhere (Krulle, T.M., ¨ delaFuente, C., Tsitsanou, K.E., Zographos, S.E., Oikonomakos, N.G., and Fleet, G.W.J., unpublished).

Kinetic Experiments Rabbit muscle GPb was isolated, purified, and recrystallized as described.27 Initial reaction rates were measured at pH 6.8 and 30°C in the direction of glycogen synthesis. Enzyme (5.0 g/ml) was assayed in a 50 mM triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, constant concentrations of glycogen (1% w/v) and AMP (1 mM) and various concentrations of Glc-1-P (3­20 mM). Initial velocities were calculated from the pseudo-first-order reaction constants and Ki values, at various inhibitor concentrations, were then determined as previously.18 The kinetic results are summarized in Tables I and II. Crystallization and Data Collection Native T-state GPb crystals were grown as described previously.28 Prior to data collection single GPb crystals were transferred in thin-walled quartz capillaries and soaked for 30 min with approximately 100 mM of the inhibitors, in a buffered solution of 10 mM BES and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 6.7. In the case of amidocarbamate (compound 8), co-crystals of GPb-amidocarbamate complex were obtained in a medium consisting of 20 ­25 mg/ml enzyme, 10 mM compound 8, 1 mM spermine, 3 mM DTT, 10 mM BES, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02 % sodium azide, pH 6.7 (16°C). Diffraction data for all complexes were collected at room temperature from one crystal of each complex on a Nicolet IPC multiwire area detector using an in-house X-ray source (Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode, graphite monochromator, 1.5418 Å), operating at 60 kV, 70 mA. The detector was placed 16 cm away from the crystal at a swing angle of 22° giving 2.3 Å resolution at the edge. Data frames of 0.2° ( ) oscillation were collected with exposure times ranging between 100 ­180 sec. All data sets were indexed in tetragonal spacegroup P43212, with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Data processing was performed using XDS.29,30 Diffraction data for the co-crystallized GPb-amidocarbamate complex were collected under cryogenic conditions (100 K) to 2.0-Å resolution, on station X11 at EMBL-Hamburg outstation ( 0.928 Å) using a MAR Research image plate. Prior to data collection co-crystals were transferred to the crystallization buffer containing 30% (v/v) glycerol for 30 sec. The enzyme complex was also crystallized in the tetragonal lattice, spacegroup P43212 but with slightly different cell dimensions resulting in volume changes of 3­ 4% compared with native crystals from which data were collected at room temperature. Data integration and reduction were performed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from HKLpackage.31 The data collection statistics are presented in Table III. Complex Structure Determination and Refinement Crystallographic refinement of all GPb complexes was carried out with X-PLOR version 3.8,32 using bulk solvent correction. All data were included with no sigma cut-off. The starting model was the refined structure of the GPb- -D-glucose complex previously determined at 2.3 Å resolution33 with glucose and water molecules removed.

Visual inspection of SIGMAA 2Fo Fc and Fo Fc electron density maps, calculated using X-PLOR, indicated that there was additional density at the catalytic binding site of GPb sufficient to accommodate the ligands, for all the experiments. Small portions of electron density were identified at the allosteric site for two complex structures (1 and 8, 100 K) suggesting weak binding of IMP (present during crystal growth). Computed models for each ligand were generated using ideal bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles with the program SYBYL.34 The ligands and IMP molecule (when present) were incorporated into the model structure and fitted to the electron density maps after adjustment of their torsion angles. Alternate cycles of manual rebuilding with the graphics program "O"35 and refinement cycles using the standard protocol described, improved the quality of the model. During the final stages of refinement water molecules were inserted into the model using WATERPICK (XPLOR), only if they met stereochemical requirements and were at hydrogen bond forming distances from appropriate atoms. For comparison purposes the water molecules numbering follows the scheme used in Gregoriou et al. (1998)36, taking into consideration that there are some discrepancies in the positions of the water molecules when the RT structures are superimposed onto the 100 K spirohydantoin complex structure. The crystallographic refinement of GPb-spirohydantoin (1) was reported previously.37 Refinement of the GPb- heptonamide (9) complex to a crystallographic R value of 0.206 for data between 8.0 and 2.3 Å, was described previously.38 Further crystallographic refinement of GPb-heptonamide (9) complex was performed using X-PLOR version 3.8 by applying bulk solvent correction and including all reflections between 18.5 and 2.3 Å. In brief, the crystallographic R factor for 34,397 reflections is 0.202 (Rfree 0.253%) and the current model, comprising residue 13­ 842 consists of 7049 nonhydrogen atoms including -heptonamide, PLP, and 248 water molecules. The RMSD

from ideal bond lengths and angles are 0.008 Å and 1.4°, respectively. The hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions of the analogs with the residues lining the catalytic site were calculated using CONTACT39 applying a distance cut-off 3.3 Å and 4.0 Å between the electronegative atoms, respectively. The program calculates the angle O...H...N (where the hydrogen position is unambiguous) and the angle source...oxygen­ bonded carbon atom. Suitable values are 120° and 90°. The network of interactions is described in Tables IV and V. The details of refinement statistics and model accuracy are listed in Table III. Structural superpositions were performed using the program "O".35 The coordinates of all complex structures have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb) with codes: 1GGN (1), 1FTQ (2), 1FTW (3), 1FTY (4), 1FU4 (5), 1FU7 (6), 1FU8 (2.3 Å), and 1P4H (2.0 Å) (7), 1FS4 (room temperature), and 1B4D (at 100 K) (8), 1GG8 (9), and 2PRJ (10). All figures were prepared with the program MolScript40 and rendered with Raster3D.41 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The catalytic site of GP is located at the core of the molecule close to the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) and access to that can be achieved only via a channel of 15 Å length and 5 Å width; in the T state the site is partially blocked by the 280s loop, comprising residues 282­287 (Fig. 1). Two sub-channels have been identified in the catalytic site: a large channel adjacent to the 280s loop, which is accessible to -C-1-substituents, the so-called -pocket (a side channel from the catalytic site, lined by both polar and nonpolar groups, directed towards residue His341, but with no access to the bulk solvent), and a smaller water-filled side channel, accessible to -C-1substituents. Both regions have been considered as targets for additional groups in order to obtain tighter binding inhibitors compared to that of glucose.16,19,27,38,42­ 44 At the catalytic site, water molecules either participate in the binding of the glucopyranose ring by direct or water mediated interactions or fill the two channels in contact with protein residues or other water molecules. Examination and comparison of several ligand complexes and their surrounding water molecules, shows that in most cases each complex contains the same number of water molecules as observed in the GPb- -D-glucose complex, and that these water molecules are in approximately the same positions.45 The design of the glucose analogs described in this work was partly based on theoretical calculations performed with the program GRID46 ­ 48, using compounds 1, 9, and 10 as lead molecules and exploiting the structural organisation of the two sub-channels at the catalytic site. GRID was used to calculate the nonbonded interaction energy between a small functional group and the protein at a number of regularly spaced positions in the vicinity of the catalytic site. The interaction energies were calculated as Lennard-Jones, electrostatic, and hydrogen-bond ener-

gies. A number of different probes (e.g. OOH, ONH2, OCH3, etc.) was employed with GRID parameters and criteria as described previously16 to identify favorable interaction sites at the catalytic site. All the compounds share the glucopyranose moiety and are classified as derivatives of spirohydantoin (functional groups ONH2, OOH, OCH3 or ONHCOCH3 introduced in N1, compounds 2­5) and -D-glucopyranosylamine (double substitutions at -1-C or -1-C positions, compounds 6 ­ 8). Kinetic studies performed at 30°C and pH 6.8, in the direction of glycogen synthesis, showed that all compounds exhibited competitive inhibition with respect to the substrate Glc-1-P. The chemical structures and the inhibition constants determined for each compound are summarized in Tables I and II. Depending on the type of the functional group incorporated, the Ki values varied from 16.5 M to 1200 M for the new analogs. Crystallographic binding experiments and structural analyses were performed with all the analogs synthesized. Previous studies had shown that spirohydantoin, com-

pound 1, is a potent inhibitor of GPb with a Ki value of 3.1 M.17 The structural results of spirohydantoin complex, from X-ray data collected under cryogenic conditions (100 K), attributed the high affinity of 1 for GPb to three key features: (a) the presence of a hydrogen bond interaction between N2 and the main chain O of His377, (b) the rigid planar spirohydantoin group that undergoes little loss of conformational energy on binding, and (c) the extended network of interactions of hydantoin polar groups with both the existing and new water molecules recruited, and the protein atoms at the catalytic site, providing additional enthalpic interactions.36 The polar contacts made to the glucopyranose moiety were similar to those described previously for glucose16,33 and were retained in almost all the complex structures. Therefore, the analyses were conducted giving more emphasis to the effect of the new functional group. The water structure at the catalytic site on binding of the new analogs is analyzed using the same numbering as in the spirohydantoin complex determined under cryogenic conditions.

All spirohydantoin-analog complexes had reduced stability compared to the lead-compound complex (1), ranging from 1.5 (3) to 3.7 kcal/mol (4). To obtain a better understanding of the influence on ligand affinity due to adding a polar or a nonpolar group of similar size at position N1 of spirohydantoin, we performed free-energy calculations on the complexes with compounds 2 and 4. Compound 2 was chosen instead of 3 as a polar­ groupcontaining inhibitor, because it had a much more reduced stability ( 2.3 kcal/mol, compared to 1.5 kcal/mol for 3). The results of these calculations are summarized below; a more detailed analysis is presented in a separate publication.22 Compound 2 Introduction of a polar amino group in the amide N1 of hydantoin, compound 2, showed that the affinity of this analog for GPb, compared to that of the lead compound (1), was significantly reduced (Ki 146 M), although one would expect that the addition of a polar group would have the opposite effect. The ligand binds to the catalytic site of the enzyme in the same mode as the lead molecule [Fig. 2(A)] and is stabilized by a direct hydrogen bond formed between N3 of the amino group and Asp283 OD1. N3 makes also a polar interaction with Asp283 OD2 and a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Asn282 O [Fig. 2(B)]. A hydrogen bond between N2 and His377 O is also present

in the complex. O8 of the flat five-membered hydantoin ring makes polar interactions with Asn284 and is hydrogenbonded to Asp339 OD1 through water X6 as in the case of compound 1.36 Similarly, O7 retains the hydrogen bond interactions of the lead compound with Leu136 N (direct hydrogen bond) and interacts with Gly135 N, and Asp283 OD1 through water X5. The introduction of the amino group caused only minor perturbation in the catalytic site such as a negligible shift of the side chain of Asn283 and N1 when the new substituent was added along with a slight rotation ( 5°) of the flat five-membered hydantoin ring. The compound appears to form an improved network of interactions; however it exhibits poorer affinity than the lead molecule. To obtain a better understanding of the structural and thermodynamical reasons for the weaker affinity of compound 2 for GPb, a study was made of the dynamical behavior of the complexes between the protein and compounds 1 and 2 by molecular dynamics simulations, and the relative binding strength of the compounds was evaluated by free-energy perturbation calculations. This work is described in detail in Archontis et al. (2005);22 here we outline the method applied for the calculations and state the conclusions. A standard computational protocol was employed, according to which compound 1 is transformed to compound 2 (and vice versa); the transformation is performed gradually, at the course of molecular simula-

Fig. 1. A schematic diagram of the GPb dimeric molecule viewed down the molecular dyad. One subunit is colored in dark green and the other in light green. The position is shown for the catalytic site. The catalytic site, marked by glucose (GLC) and the essential cofactor pyridoxal 5 -phosphate (PLP), shown in ball-and-stick representations, is buried at the center of the subunit and is accessible to the bulk solvent through a 15-Å long channel. Close-up: Details of the interactions of glucose with residues of the catalytic site. -D-Glucose, a competitive inhibitor (Ki 1.7 mM), on binding at the catalytic site, promotes the less active T state through stabilization of the closed position of the 280s loop (shown in cream) which blocks access for the substrate (glycogen) to the catalytic site. In particular, the -1-OH is hydrogen-bonded to Asp283 (OD1), through a water molecule, and the 2-OH is hydrogen-bonded directly to Asn284 (ND2). The binding of glucose at the catalytic site is dominated by multiple neutral hydrogen bonds from each of the peripheral hydroxyl groups to protein atoms, but there are no lipophilic aromatic/glucopyranose interactions that characterize the high affinity periplasmic monosaccharide binding proteins.33

the protein environment and in solution. In the protein complex, the conversion of 1 to 2 was associated with a positive free energy change of 1.65 1.1 kcal/mol. In solution, the corresponding free-energy difference was 0.65 0.15 kcal/mol. Thus, the relative affinity of compound 2 for the protein was smaller by 1.0 1.1 kcal/mol, in fair agreement with the experimental value ( 2.3 kcal/mol). To interpret the computed relative affinities, it is instructive to study the response of the environment to the ligand transformation, by evaluating "free-energy components," i.e., contributions to the total free-energy change from individual interaction terms, and/or individual chemical groups.49,50 We discuss here the results along a "linear path," where the van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between the appearing (disappearing) groups on the ligand and the rest of the system were switched on (off) simultaneously. More details, as well as results along an alternative path, are presented in Archontis et al.22 At the initial stages (direction 1 3 2), or the final stages (direction 2 3 1) of the transformation, van der Waals interactions between the introduced amino group (compound 2) and nearby residues (the side chain of Asp283 and water molecule X4) yield a positive contribution to the free

energy. This was partly cancelled by a negative contribution due to electrostatic interactions between the amino group and several catalytic-site residues. Along the same path in solution, both van der Waals and electrostatic free energy components were smaller in absolute value, resulting in a free-energy change that was again positive (direction 1 3 2), but smaller than in the protein. Thus, it seems that the protein constitutes a less flexible medium than the water solution; insertion of an amino group (compound 2) at the catalytic site introduces subtle structural perturbations, that cannot be alleviated by a significant improvement on the ligand­ catalytic site interactions. As a result, compound 2 has a weaker affinity than 1. Comparison between the structures of the two complexes [Fig. 2(A,B)] might suggest that compound 2 should have a higher affinity for the protein, in contrast to the free-energy result (or experiment). In accordance with this, an analysis of the simulations of the two complexes showed that the introduced amino group (compound 2) forms favorable interactions with surrounding protein residues (particularly, van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Asn284 and Gly135; Table II, Archontis et al.22 These interactions are missing in compound 1. However, consideration of the ligand-environment interaction

energies alone may not be always sufficient for an accurate estimation of relative binding strengths; additional factors, such as perturbation of the environment (e.g., disruption of the protein­protein interactions), entropic effects and the change in solubility (i.e., the transformation of the ligand in solution, which is often neglected in structural analyses), can play an important role in the observed binding. This point was discussed in detail in Archontis et al.22 Compound 3 A hydroxyl group was then introduced in the same position as the amino group. The new analog, compound 3, was a better inhibitor than 2, with a Ki value of 39.3 M, but did not exhibit higher potency than 1 as it was initially intended. The hydrogen bond of N2 with His377 O is retained [Fig. 2(C)]. O9 of the hydroxyl group makes hydrogen bond interactions with Asn284 ND2 through water U2, which is also hydrogen bonded to O8 of the

heterocyclic 5-membered ring stabilizing the side chain of Asn284. Water X6 is not present and as a result the water-mediated interaction of O8 of the ligand with Asp339 (observed in the complexes of 1 and 2 with GPb) is disrupted. In contrast, water X7 (which might be considered as water X4 shifted by 1.4 Å) is present in the complex of 3 with GPb, forms a hydrogen bond with N of Gly134 but its distance (3.8 Å) from O8 is too long for a hydrogen bond. Again, a slight rotation of the flat fivemembered hydantoin ring and no major conformational changes were observed on binding of the ligand. There is no net change in the number of hydrogen bonds for both compounds 2 and 3 although the functional group of 3 forms one hydrogen bond (to water U2), compared with two observed in the functional group of 2 (Table IV). Overall, compound 3 (Ki 39 M) forms fewer van der Waals interactions compared with compound 2, and yet it is a better inhibitor than 2 (Ki 146 M). As discussed above, it is not always accurate to interpret small changes

GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE INHIBITORS

in binding strengths (0.8 kcal/mol between 2 and 3) on the basis of ligand­protein interactions alone. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that an explanation may partly be attributed to the hydrogen-bonding properties of the oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The crystal structure of GPb-3 complex shows that O9 is hydrogen bonded to water U2 but not to Asp283 (Table IV), although the ­OH group is at a hydrogen bonding distance from Asp283 (O9 is 2.7 Å from OD1 and 2.9 Å from OD2 of Asp283). The program CONTACT (CCP4 1994) does not list this interaction due to a slight deviation of the allowed angle value for this bond. In the GPb-2 complex structure, the corresponding distances for N3 of the amine group are 2.9 Å and 3.3 Å from OD1 and OD2 of Asp283, respectively. Estimates of the precision of coordinates indicate errors on the order of 0.2­ 0.3 Å in positional coordinates, therefore, it can be assumed that the hydrogen bond(s) between O9 and Asp283 is also maintained in the 3 complex. In this case we would expect the NH. . .O bond to be the weakest hydrogen bond and the OH. . .N bond to be the strongest, as is observed in the quantum chemical calculations.51,52 This difference might be enhanced in the less polar GP catalytic site, compared to the water solution, raising the affinity of compound 3 for the protein with respect to 2. In addition, the length of NOO bond is 1.39 Å, whereas the NON bond is 1.45 Å, and this difference may lead to subtle steric clashes of the ONH2 group with the protein residues in the vicinity. Higher resolution structures of the complexes would enable a more accurate determination of the network of the interactions. Another explanation for the energy difference (approximately 0.8 kcal/mol) may lie in the energy required to dehydrate compounds 2 and 3. The loss of energy in the transfer of the OOH group from the solvent to the protein may be less compared to that of the ONH2 group, but there is no experimental evidence to substantiate this. Compound 4 A nonpolar substitution was then made by adding a OCH3 group (4) to the amide N1 of 1 that resulted in a very poor inhibitor with a Ki value of 1200 M. The heterocyclic five-membered ring inclined by 10° (compared to the lead compound complex) when the methyl group was incorporated in the lead compound and N1 and N2 of the hydantoin ring shifted by 0.4 Å. However, the hydrogen bond interactions shown in the hydantoin complex (1) were maintained [Fig. 2(D)]. O8 is hydrogen bonded to Asp339 OD1 through water X6 and forms weaker interactions with Asn284 OD1, O7 forms a direct hydrogen bond with L136 N and a water mediated one (water X5) with Asp283 OD1, Gly135 N and water X9, and N2 interacts with a hydrogen bond with His377 O. Minor conformational changes were also observed in the side chains of Asp283 and Asn284, on binding of compound 4, in order to accommodate the new functional group. The methyl group (C9) makes nine van der Waals contacts (seven nonpolar/polar and two nonpolar/nonpolar interactions, Table V) to Asp283, Asn284, and water molecules

X4, X5, and U4, and it seems that this is not a favorable environment for a methyl group. The relative binding strength of compounds 1 and 4 was also evaluated by free-energy perturbation calculations, following a computational transformation protocol analogous to the one presented above. In all, five free-energy runs of the transformation from 1 to 4 (and vice versa) were conducted in the protein complex and in solution. The calculations predict that compound 4 is a weaker inhibitor than compound 1 by 3.75 ( 1.4) kcal/mol, in good agreement with the experimental difference (3.57 kcal/mol). The transformation of compound 1 to 4 involves the substitution of a hydrogen atom (connected to N1 in 1) by a methyl group (compound 4). Relative to the solution, in the protein­ligand complex the transformation is accompanied by a large, positive free energy change; this corresponds to a positive binding free energy of compound 4 relative to compound 1 (Archontis et al.22). The large free energy change associated with the conversion of compound 1 to 4 in the protein complex is due to steric interactions between the introduced methyl group and proximal protein residues (particularly Asp283) and water molecules (crystallographic water X4 in [Fig. 2(A­D)]. Although the transfer of a nonpolar group from water to a nonpolar medium is thermodynamically favored, the protein interior can be hardly considered as nonpolar; the introduced methyl group makes two nonpolar/nonpolar and seven polar/nonpolar interactions with protein (Table V). Furthermore, it seems that there is not sufficient space in the catalytic site to accommodate the additional methyl group without subtle, unfavorable perturbations on the protein complex structure. Compound 4 is also a much weaker inhibitor than compound 2, both experimentally and theoretically. In the free-energy simulations of the protein complexes the methyl group of compound 4 forms stronger steric interactions with the catalytic site residues than the amino group of compound 2, at the same time lacking the favorable electrostatic interactions of the latter.22 These factors may contribute to the higher affinity of compound 2 relative to 4. Compound 5 The acetylated derivative of amino-hydantoin (2) was then synthesized. The new derivative, compound 5, exhibited poorer inhibition compared to both molecules of the same class 1 and 2 with a Ki value of 550 M and slightly better inhibition with respect to 4 (Ki 1200 M). The characteristic interaction of N2 with His377 O is also present in this complex [Fig. 2(E)]. O8 interacts with the main chain N of Asn284 through a water-mediated hydrogen bond with water U2. O7 forms a hydrogen bond with water X5, which in turn is hydrogen-bonded to both N3 and O10 of the ligand, Gly139 N and water X9. N3, shifts by 0.6 Å compared to the amino-spirohydantoin (2) complex structure and stabilizes the side chain of Asp283 by forming a water-mediated hydrogen bond with OD2 through water X5. In addition, N1 of the acetylated aminohydantoin is displaced by 0.5 Å and C1 is slightly

980

K.A. WATSON ET AL.

shifted with reference to the structures of both the spirohydantoin and aminohydantoin in complex with GPb. The environment of the catalytic site is subjected to detectable changes on binding of 5. In specific, despite the fact that the 280s loop retains its overall orientation, residues Asp283, and Asn284 shift away from the ligand in order to create more space for the bulky substituent to be accommodated without causing steric hindrance (the C atoms shift by 0.7 Å). His571 shows a change in the ( 1, 2) angles from ( 103°, 75°) in the 1 complex structure to ( 154°, 65°) causing displacement of a water molecule. The side chain of Asp283 also changes ( 1, 2) angles from ( 73°, 75°) in 1 complex to (159°, 175°). On binding of 5 the water structure is altered. The acetyl group is now located in a position previously occupied by two water molecules, X4 and U4. A slight shift of Glu88 and Gly133 is also observed. There are in total 17 hydrogen bonds and 91 van der Waals interactions in 5 complex, while compound 4 exploits 14 hydrogen bonds and 72 van der Waals interactions (Table V). It seems that the net effect of the additional interactions of 5 over 4, in combination with protein reorganization, is able to stabilize the complex with the bulkier group of 5 compared with the methyl group of 4. Therefore, the new interactions could compensate to some extent the penalty associated with the protein reorganization in the vicinity of the catalytic site. As a result the 5 complex is more stable than 4 but not as stable as 1­3 complexes. A major contribution to the difference in the binding affinity between 5 and lead-compound 1 may result from a loss in conformational entropy when the flexible substituent of compound 5 is localized on the enzyme. The energy cost for the changes in the side chain conformation of the 280s loop residues and the water structure, as well as the loss of conformational entropy of the ligand on binding, might outweigh the gain from the increased interactions that confer rigidity to the complex. Compound 6 The second series of analogs were designed by making modifications in 9 and 10 studied previously. On binding to GPb, -heptonamide (9) forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds from its CO and NH groups to OE2 of Glu88, N of Gly134, N of Gly135, and OD1 of Asp28338 [Fig. 2(J)] and the torsion angle O5­C1­C7­O7 is 113.5°. N-acetyl- -Dglucopyranosylamine (10), is among the first potent inhibitors identified for GPb (Ki 32 M).18,19 The amide nitrogen of 10 is interacting with the carbonyl O of His377 [Fig. 2(K)] forming a hydrogen bond as observed in all spirohydantoin derivatives. Addition of an ether oxygen in the functional group of 10, compound 6, did not improve the affinities of the lead molecule (10) and resulted in an inhibitor with a Ki value of 86 M. The network of interactions of 6 is almost identical to that of N-acetyl- -D-glucopyranosylamine complex. N2 is hydrogen bonded to His377 O; O8 is hydrogenbonded to water U2 and X4; X4 in turn interacts with Asp283 OD1, Leu136 N and waters X5 and X7; water X5 is further hydrogen-bonded to Asp283 OD1 and Gly135 N [Fig. 2(F)]. Introduction of the ether oxygen induces a

slight shift in the positions of N1 (0.3 Å) and C8 (0.5 Å) compared to the complex structure of 10. The side chain of Leu136, moves away from the ligand ( 2 changes from 54 to 148°) to create more space, while the side chains of Glu382 and His571 adopt different conformations: Glu382 3 changes from 157° to 47°; His571 ( 1, 2) changes from ( 148°, 65°) to ( 102°, 72°) (not shown). There are negligible changes in residues Asp283 and Asn284. As in the case of 5 over 4 complexes, the free-energy cost due to the induced conformational changes and the loss of rotational entropy about C8 ­O11 in the bound state, might have led to a net loss of stability despite a possible energy gain from the interactions formed between either oxygen O11 and the protein (10 van der Waals interactions, Table V). Compound 7 The inhibition of GPb activity seemed not to be enhanced (Ki 310 M) when the functional group of 9, was combined with that of 10. The acetamido-formamide, compound 7, was found to be 10 times weaker inhibitor compared to the parent molecule (10). The characteristic hydrogen bond interaction of N2 with the carboxyl O of His377 is also maintained in this analog when bound to GPb. O8 is involved in a water-mediated hydrogen bond to Asn284 N through water U2 and a direct hydrogen bond to water X4, which is in turn hydrogen-bonded to N1 and O7 of the ligand, the backbone N of Leu136 and waters X5 and X7 [Fig. 2(G)]. O7 also forms a polar contact with water X5, which further interacts with N1. The N1 atom is directly hydrogen-bonded to Asn284 OD1. Comparison of the position of glucopyranose ring of 7 with that in 10 and 9 when in complex with GPb reveals slight shifts in atoms C1, C3, and O5 (7 vs. 10 complex) and atoms C1 and O5 (7 vs. 9 complex). Shifts of 0.7 Å and 0.5 Å were observed for atoms O8 and C11, respectively. His571 shows a change in the ( 1, 2) angles from ( 148°, 65°) in the 10 complex structure to ( 100°, 72°) and one water molecule was displaced as in the case of 5 and 6 complexes. This water displacement was not observed in the structure of 9 complex. A reorganization of the water molecules in order to accommodate the new functional groups was also observed. Examination of 7 and 10 complex structures shows that water molecules X2, X6, and U4 are not present, while water molecule X1 has been displaced in order to avoid clashes with -CONH2 group; water X4 has shifted by 0.4 Å (but 01.4 Å compared to 1 complex), water X5 and U2 have shifted by 0.4 Å and 0.5 Å respectively, and U10, which makes a polar interaction (3.5 Å) with His341 NE2, has shifted by 0.7 Å. Comparison of 7 with 9 complex structure shows that water molecules X2 and U4 are not present; water X6 is slightly shifted to facilitate binding of the new substituent; water X4 shifts by 1.5 Å enabling the formation of a hydrogen bond between Asp283 and the ligand; U2 and U10 shift by 0.4 Å and 0.7 Å, accordingly. Although the network of interactions is enhanced when both functional groups are present, the affinity is not improved; this may be due to the increased

GLYCOGEN PHOSPHORYLASE INHIBITORS

981

conformational entropy (e.g., increased number of rotatable bonds) when both functional groups are present, to small adjustments in the glucosyl moiety, and changes in the water structure. Previous studies with numerous glucose analogs9,11,16,27,38,42,44 showed that -C1-substitution resulted in better inhibitors compared to -C1substitution, because of the smaller size of the -pocket compared to the -pocket. This is indeed seen here where 7 is much weaker than 10, but comparable to 9. Compound 8 In contrast, the addition of an ether oxygen in the methyl group of 7 (compound 8) made a significant difference in the affinity (Ki 16.5 M). The amide N2 formed a direct hydrogen bond to His377 O as in the previous complexes. O8 is hydrogen bonded to water U2, which interacts further with Asn284 N. O11 stabilizes the side chain of Asn284 by interacting with ND2 while O7 is hydrogen-bonded to Leu136 N and water X5 [Fig. 2(H)]. Water X5 is in turn hydrogen-bonded to N1 of the ligand, Asp283 OD1, Gly135 N, and water X9. Water X9 interacts further with the backbone N of Arg569, Lys574 NZ, and PLP O2P. Comparison of the complex structure of 8 with those of 10 and 9 complexes shows a negligible deviation in the atoms of the glucopyranose ring. Differences were observed in the positions of the atoms N2, C8, O8, and O11 which shifted by 0.4, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.2 Å, respectively, compared to 10. The dihedral angle 1 of His571 changes from 148° (10) and 102° (9) to 126°, so that the NE2 of His571 shifts by 1­1.2 Å. The position of the active-site glycine helix (residues 133­150) now approaches the ligand and makes more favorable interactions such as a direct hydrogen bond between Leu136 and O7 compared to 10. The water structure exhibits some variation. In specific, water X2 is present in identical position compared to 10 but water U7 is shifted by 1.3 Å (8 vs. 10 complex), and 1 Å (8 vs. 9 complex). Similarly, water U1, which is absent in the 9 complex, is shifted by 2 Å in order to accommodate the new substituent. Water X4 moves by 1.3 Å compared to 10 complex but remains almost unchanged with reference to 9. Water X5 is slightly shifted, while water U2 is roughly located in the same position as in 10 or 9 complexes. A dislocation of water U4 compared with the 1 complex is observed while water W109 (numbering from 10) is not present in the 8 complex structure. Compound 8 is a better inhibitor than compounds 7 or 6, with a relative affinity that is equal to 1.8 and 1.0 kcal/mol, respectively. In the complex with 8, the Asn284 side chain is slightly rotated compared to the other two complexes, and its ND2 atom is at an interaction distance of 2.9 Å from the ether oxygen. In the complex with 6, the corresponding distance is 3.7 Å; in the complex with 7, the ether oxygen is missing. These differences may account partly for the improved affinity of 8, compared to 6 and 7. In an attempt to give further insights into the high affinity of 8, the crystal structure of 8 complex was determined under cryogenic conditions (100 K) at 2.0 Å resolution. However, the mode of binding and the interactions that 8

makes with the catalytic site residues are almost identical in both the room temperature and 100 K structures [Fig. 2(I)]. CONCLUSIONS Two series of compounds were designed, synthesized, and tested for inhibition and crystallographic binding to GPb. In the first series, functional groups such as ONH2, OOH, OCH3 or ONHCOCH3 were introduced in the N1 of spirohydantoin (compounds 2­5), and in the second series, double substitutions at ­C­1 and ­C­1 positions of glucopyranose ring were incorporated (compounds 6 ­ 8). Structural studies of these analogs, in complex with GPb, showed that the changes observed were localized at the catalytic site and in particular in residues Asp283 and Asn284 of the 280s loop, and the active-site glycine helix. The hydrogen bond formed between the His377 O and N2 seems to be a common feature for all compounds studied. Some of the shifts in the positions of the residues in the vicinity of the catalytic site are at the limit of the precision of the crystallographic data, however they provide a partial explanation for the differences in affinity. Introduction of an ONH2 group in the amide N1 of 1 (compound 2) leads to subtle structural perturbations, that cannot be alleviated by a significant improvement on the number of contacts, resulting in a poorer inhibitor (Ki 146 M) than 1 (Ki 3.1 M). Introduction of an OOH group in the same position (compound 3) resulted in a more effective inhibitor with a difference in binding energy between 2 and 3 of about 0.8 kcal/mol. Analysis of sugar crystal structures has suggested that the OOH is considerably a stronger proton donor than the ONH2 group. Introduction of the non-polar OCH3 group (4) to the amide N1 of 1 resulted in a poorer inhibition constant (Ki 1200 M) than the lead compound. Comparison of the 1 and 4 complexes revealed that the most significant differences between the two structures are minor conformational changes shifts of side chains of Asp283 and Asn284, on binding of 4, in order to accommodate the new functional group. Similarly, the acetylated derivative of 2 (compound 5) exhibited a slightly better inhibition (Ki 550 M). Accommodation of the bulkier group within the catalytic site resulted in shifts of residues Asp283 and Asn284 away from the ligand, and displacement of two water molecules. Free-energy perturbation calculations evaluated the effect on stability upon adding an amino group (compound 2) or a methyl group (compound 4) at position N1 of the lead compound. The calculations predicted that neither group can be accommodated in the catalytic site without destabilizing the complex, in accord with experiment.22 A free-energy component analysis showed that the main contribution to the decrease in stability originated from a positive van der Waals freeenergy component, due to large van der Waals interactions between the new groups and the surrounding catalytic site at the early stages of the introduction. In the second series of compounds, introduction of the ether oxygen in the acetamide group of the lead compound 10 (compound 6) resulted in a less effective inhibitor with a

Ki 86 M despite a possible energy gain from the interactions formed between ether oxygen and the protein. The most likely source for the difference in binding energies (about 0.6 kcal/mol) is the loss of conformational entropy when the more flexible side chain of 6 is bound. Attempts to improve binding by combining the substituents from 9 and 10 leads to a compound (7) that binds slightly better (Ki 310 M) than 9 (Ki 370 M), but significantly worse than 10 (Ki 32 M). It appears that the poor affinity of 7 can be also explained by the increased conformational entropy, when both functional groups are present, together with small adjustments in the glucosyl moiety and changes in the water structure. On the contrary, the increased binding of 8 (Ki 16.5 M) is very interesting, considering the decreased binding of 6 and 7. The structural results suggest that there are differences between the interactions of O11 and the Asn284 side chain in the three complexes with 6, 7, 8, consistent with the higher affinity of 8, which is the best inhibitor of this series. The results of this work showed that the catalytic site of glycogen phosphorylase binds a diverse series of ligands with relatively small changes in stability. In the series 7­10, the largest free-energy change (between 8 and 9) is only 1.85 kcal/mol, despite the large difference between the corresponding ligands. In the hydantoin series, ligands containing very different chemical groups bind with comparable strength; e.g, complexes with 4 and 5 differ in stability by 0.5 kcal/mol. The ability of GP to accommodate these ligands could be partly attributed to the properties of the catalytic site; e.g., the existence of two pockets ( - and -pocket), the presence of numerous water molecules and the flexibility of the 280s loop, comprising residues 282­287, enable structural rearrangements such as the ones described above. It is precisely this ability though that makes it difficult to rationalize the design of improved catalytic-site GP inhibitors. For instance, in the spirohydantoin series, compounds 2 and 3 had been synthesized as potentially better inhibitors than compound 1, because it was thought that improved binding would result from possible additional hydrogen bonds between the NH2 or OH group and the protein; compound 4 was chosen, based on the expectation that the addition of a nonpolar group would increase the binding strength. However, all compounds were found to bind more weakly to GP than compound 1. The free energy calculations showed that the insertion of a group at position N1 is not favored, primarily due to lack of space in the protein. Thus, it is likely to prove difficult to obtain improved inhibitors by chemical modifications at N1. As explained in this work and the companion article,22 an attempt to estimate the relative binding strength based on consideration of the ligand-environment interactions alone may not be sufficient. Other factors, such as changes in the protein and ligand energy and entropy upon binding and changes in solubility (i.e., the alchemical transformation of the ligand in solution, which is often neglected in structural analyses) can play an important role in the observed binding. The complexity of these effects is to a

large extent captured by the free-energy calculations described here and in more detail in the companion article.22 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by British Diabetic Association Fellowship to KAW, a Royal Society Joint Project (to Prof. Dame Louise N.
