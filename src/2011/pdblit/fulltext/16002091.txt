The Mg2C-dependent GAAA tetraloop interaction with its 11 nucleotide receptor is one of the most frequently occurring long-range tertiary interactions in RNAs. To explore conformational changes in the receptor during tetraloop docking, nitroxide spin labels were attached at each of four uridine bases, one at a time, within an RNA molecule containing the receptor sequence. In the presence of Mg2C and the tetraloop, the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of one of the labeled bases reflected a large increase in mobility, indicating unstacking of the base upon tetraloop docking. This provides direct evidence that base unstacking is an intrinsic feature of the solution tetraloop­receptor complex formed in the presence of Mg2C. Additional evidence suggests that in solution the bound receptor conformation is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of a group I intron ribozyme domain. In Mg2C alone, a receptor conformation with an unstacked base was not detectable, suggesting that this conformation is of higher standard state free energy than that of the free receptor. This leads to the conclusion that the extensive RNA­RNA interactions observed in the crystal structure of the tetraloop­receptor complex provide larger interaction energy than the measured apparent affinity between the tetraloop and the free receptor. This is compatible with a high specificity of the tetraloop­receptor interaction.

RNA serves as templates, catalysts, and regulators of gene expression.1 While structure determination of large RNAs2­4 and RNPs, particularly the ribosome,5­7 has led to an enormous increase in high-resolution RNA structural information, much less is known about how RNA structures change in solution during interaction and function. The technique of site-directed spin labeling (SDSL), which derives information from a site-specifically attached nitroxide moiety that contains a stable unpaired electron, provides a means of monitoring conformational changes in high-molecular mass systems under physiological conditions.8,9 Recently, SDSL has been utilized to

The GAAA tetraloop­ receptor interaction is the most studied member of the GNRA (N, any nt; R, purines) tetraloop/ receptor family, one of the most frequently occurring tertiary interaction motifs in RNA.18­21 The interaction serves as an important tertiary structural element, bringing together nucleotides that are far apart in the primary sequence of large RNAs such as group I introns2,18 and group II introns.22,23 It has been shown that the tetraloop­

3 The labeled TLR molecules were utilized to monitor the conformation of the bound receptor in solution. The data reveal that tetraloop docking in the presence of Mg 2C gives rise to a new conformational state of the isolated receptor in solution, in which the mobility of the U19 base increases drastically, apparently due to unstacking of this base. This result provides the first evidence that base unstacking is an intrinsic feature of the isolated solution TLR/TL complex formed in the presence of Mg2C. In the absence of the tetraloop, the unstacked conformation cannot be detected in the presence of 125 mM Mg2C. This indicates that a TLR-Mg state, where U19 is unstacked and the receptor is pre-configured to the A-platform, is of higher free energy than the free receptor. Therefore, the stabilizing energy obtained from forming the extensive RNA­RNA interactions revealed in the crystal structure of the bound receptor, which is equivalent to the binding energy between the tetraloop and the TLR-Mg state, must be higher than the measured binding energy between the tetraloop and the free receptor. This is favorable for high specificity in the tetraloop­receptor interaction. The solution conformation of the tetraloop bound receptor Studies were carried out under established solution conditions where TLR forms a Mg2Cdependent, weak but specific complex with a 12 nt RNA hairpin containing the tetraloop (designated TL; Figure 1(a)).13 Addition of TL to the TLR in the presence of Mg2C led to clear spectral changes at U19, indicating structural changes in the receptor upon tetraloop binding (Figure 1(b)). The U19 spectral changes are manifested as a reduction in intensity of the low field peak together with the appearance of a new spectral component corresponding to a more mobile state of the spin label

receptor interaction is highly sequence specific,21 and requires the participation of Mg2C.2,13,18 Highresolution structures have revealed that the 11 nt receptor free in solution24 has a very different conformation from the receptor bound to the tetraloop in the crystalline state2 (Figure 1(a)). In the presence of NaC, the unbound receptor is an "A-zipper", with cross-strand stacking of A6, A18, and A7 and an unusual U5/U19 pairing 24 (Figure 1(a)). The bound receptor, observed in the P46 core domain of the group I intron Tetrahymena crystal structure,2 reveals an "A-platform" configuration, where A6 and A7 form an intra-strand platform, and U19 is unstacked (Figure 1(a)). In the crystal lattice, this configuration may be stabilized by contact interactions with a neighboring molecule.2 A high-resolution structure of the docked receptor in solution is currently not available, and the mechanism leading to the Mg2C-dependent formation of the tetraloop-receptor complex is unknown. A specific mechanism has been suggested but not tested experimentally.24 Utilizing a previously developed 4-thio-U labeling scheme,11 a nitroxide derivative, R1b (Figure 1(a), inset), was attached, one at a time, to specific uridine positions within a 23 nt RNA molecule (designated TLR) containing the receptor sequence (Figure 1(a)). Studies on four sites are reported here: three of them (U19, U5, and U17) reside within the 11 nt receptor motif, and the other is located immediately adjacent to the receptor motif (U16) (Figure 1(a)). Previous studies have indicated that the R1b labels do not significantly perturb the structure of TLR free in solution.11 The mobility of the nitroxide label is modulated by the mobility of the RNA base and the interactions between the nitroxide side-chain and the local RNA environment.11 The observed X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra report nitroxide mobility in the 0.1­50 ns regime, and can be correlated with local RNA structure at the labeling site.11

that are individually labeled. The chemical structure of the nitroxide (Rb) labeled uridine is shown in the inset. The wildtype and 4-thio-U modified RNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The RNAs were deprotected and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The thiol-reactive nitroxide derivatives (Rb), 1-Oxyl-3-methanesulfonatethiomethyl-4-methyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline, was a gift from Dr K. Hidge (University of ´ Pecs, Hungary). Attachment of nitroxide to TLR and purification of labeled RNAs were carried out as reported.11 (b) Spectra observed in the absence (KTL, black traces) and presence (CTL, green traces) of tetraloop. The difference spectra (Diff, red traces) were obtained by subtracting the -TL spectra from the corresponding CTL spectra. All three spectra at a given site were plotted to the same scale and overlay. Positive regions in the Diff spectrum indicate an amplitude increase in the presence of TL, while negative regions indicate reduction. Significant changes were observed only at U19 and U16, which are marked by orange triangles that correspond to either amplitude increase (up-triangle) or decrease (down-triangle) upon binding of TL. EPR spectra were obtained in a Varian E-109 EPR spectrometer as described.11 The measured spectra were baseline corrected and normalized to a fixed number of spins. Interfering signals from the small amount of free spin label (!1%) were subtracted. Measurements were carried out with labeled TLR (w30 mM) at room temperature in 500 mM NaCl, 125 mM MgCl2, 50 mM 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid (Mops)(pH 6.6) and 33.3%(w/v) sucrose. Under these conditions, an observed spectrum reports site-specific nitroxide motion that is affected by the mobility of the labeled RNA base and the interaction between the nitroxide side-chain and the local RNA environment.11 The CTL spectra were obtained with 1 mM TL, which gave a tetraloop­receptor complex population of 71% according to the measured affinity between unmodified TL and TLR.13 Although the spectra shown likely represent a mixture of bound and free receptor, this does not affect the conclusions drawn in the text, as studies using a modified RNA construct with higher affinity showed the same spectral effects at U19, U5, and U17 upon saturating tetraloop-receptor binding (P.Z.Q. & A. Oki, unpublished data).

4 (down and up arrows, respectively, in the U19 panel of Figure 1(b)). The mobile component reflects specific GAAA tetraloop­receptor docking, as it was absent if the GAAA tetraloop was substituted by a UUCG loop. The increase in nitroxide mobility at U19 is consistent with the conformational difference between the free receptor, in which U19 is stacked within the helix and hydrogen-bonded with U5,24 and a crystalline receptor­tetraloop complex, in which the base equivalent to U19 is unstacked2 (Figure 1(a); vide infra). No significant spectral changes were observed at U5 and U17 within the receptor motif (Figure 1(b)), suggesting no changes in the local environment at U5 and U7 that are detectable via spin labels. This is consistent with the crystal structure in which these bases remain base-paired and stacked.2 Alternatively, the lack of spectral changes at U5 and U17 could arise from spin label perturbations that interfere with the weak interaction between the isolated tetraloop and receptor. Further studies of the same tetraloop-receptor interaction embedded within a high affinity construct showed no EPR spectral changes under conditions where receptors with spin labels attached to U5 or U17 were shown to be in the docked state (P.Z.Q. & A. Oki, unpublished data), thus supporting the conclusion that no docking-dependent receptor conformational changes are detectable with spin labels at U5 and U17. Both the free (KTL) and bound (CTL) spectra of the label at U16, located immediately outside the receptor motif, reflect characteristics of a stacked base,11 which is consistent with the available highresolution structure data (Figure 1(b)).2,24 Comparison between the free and bound spectra revealed a small reduction in nitroxide mobility upon tetraloop docking (Figure 1(b)), which suggests slight variation of the local RNA environment. However, the current level of information on how RNA structure and dynamics dictate the nitroxide spectra is not sufficient to allow further interpretation of the origin of this small change. All in all, the spin label data show that in solution the docked receptor undergoes conformational changes, and adopt a configuration that is consistent with that revealed in the P46 core domain crystal structure. The dynamics of the nitroxide reports base mobility at U19 in the docked receptor Does the change in nitroxide mobility at U19 originate from an increase in RNA base mobility, or does it reflect only changes at the labeling site that reduce motional restrictions of the nitroxide sidechain? This question was addressed by comparing U19 spectra of wild-type TLR and a deoxyU19 variant, where the 2 0 -OH group at U19 was mutated to 2 0 -H (Figure 2). The deoxyU19 mutation changes a functional group at the sugar moiety. In the absence of TL, the solution NMR structure shows that there is no interaction between U19 2 0 -OH and

SDSL Studies of Tetraloop­Receptor Interactions

any other RNA functional groups (Figure 2(a)).24 However, the crystal structure of the tetraloopreceptor complex revealed a hydrogen bond formed between the unstacked U19 base and its sugar moiety (U19 O2 and 2 0 -OH; Figure 2(b)).2 The deoxyU19 mutation removes this hydrogen bond and should result in further increase in base mobility only in the docked state. Consistent with the lack of interaction with the U19 2 0 -OH group in the free receptor, no spectral difference was observed between U19 and deoxyU19 in the absence of TL, and the deoxyU19 spectrum is superimposable on that of the U19 (Figure 2(c); KTL panel). In the presence of TL and Mg2C, new components reflecting higher mobility appeared in spectra of both U19 and deoxyU19 (Figure 2(c); CTL panel). However, in deoxyU19 the new component is of higher mobility than that in U19, as revealed by the shifting of this component towards the center line (indicated by the gray box in Figure 2(c); CTL panel). This is consistent with the predicted higher deoxyU19 base mobility in the docked state. These results provide further evidence that in solution the docked receptor adopts a conformation similar to that in the crystalline complex. Modeling studies based on the crystal structure of the bound receptor indicated that it is not possible ° to place any nitroxide functional groups within 3 A 0 of the U19 2 -OH group (Figure 2). The nitroxide mobility change caused by the deoxyU19 mutation is apparently due to increase in mobility of the labeled RNA base. The data reveal a direct link between the dynamics (mobility) of the nitroxide and that of the RNA base in the 0.1­50 ns regime. Currently, information on RNA base dynamics in the picosecond to nanosecond regime is limited.25­29 The utility of nitroxides to monitor specific RNA base dynamics on the nanosecond time scale in high molecular mass complexes should be highly advantageous, particularly in systems that are not accessible to other methods. The role of Mg2C in the receptor conformational change It has been shown that Mg2C is indispensable in tetraloop­receptor interaction.13 Inspection of the crystal structure of the bound receptor2 revealed the presence of a single bound Mg2C , which is coordinated by multiple functional groups from A18, U19, and G20 (Figure 3(a)). To establish this Mg2C binding pocket requires (i) unstacking of the U19 base and (ii) unraveling of the A-zipper to position A18 below G20 (Figure 3(b)). Therefore, Mg2C binding would favor an A-platform state adopted by the bound receptor. If this mode of Mg2C binding indeed occurs during solution tetraloop­receptor interaction, it would stabilize the tetraloop­receptor complex, even though the specifically bound Mg2C is not located at the interface between the two RNAs and does not directly coordinate the tetraloop.

(a) The configuration of the U19 base (shown as a thick stick) in the solution structure of the free TLR.24 The Rb nitroxide side-chain (pink stick) was modeled into the structure.11 The U19 O2 (red ball) and 2 0 -OH (white ball) are separated by ° 5.17 A, and do not interact with each other. (b) The configuration of the base equivalent to U19 (thick stick) in the crystal structure of the tetraloop­receptor complex.2 Notice that U19 O2 (red ball) and 2 0 -OH (white ball) are separated by ° 2.46 A and form a hydrogen bond (dotted line). There is no direct interaction between the 2 0 -OH and the nitroxide sidechain (pink stick). (c) Observed spectra for the U19 (black traces) and deoxyU19 (green traces) in the absence (KTL) and presence (CTL) of tetraloop. The difference spectra (Diff, red traces) were obtained by subtracting the U19 spectra from the corresponding deoxyU19 spectra. All spectra were obtained and plotted as described for Figure 1(b). For the CTL panel, a gray box indicates the TL-dependent mobile component. The difference spectrum shows a reduction of the U19 mobile component (down triangle) and appearance of a component closer to the center line (up triangle) in deoxyU19. Both features indicate higher mobility in the deoxyU19 spectrum upon TL binding.

Can Mg2C alone unstack U19 and convert the receptor to the A-platform, thus pre-configuring the receptor to lock-in the tetraloop? This question was addressed by utilizing the labeled TLR molecules to study how the receptor conformation is affected by Mg2C alone in solution. In the absence of TL, addition of 0.125 M MgCl2 to TLR does not lead to nitroxide mobility increase at U19 (Figure 3(b)),

indicating that Mg2C alone at this concentration is not sufficient to stabilize the unstacked U19 conformation in detectable amounts (%5% of the total TLR concentration). Addition of Mg2C led to no change at U16 and U5, and a very small mobility decrease at U17 that might be due to the increase in the solution ionic strength (Figure 3(b)). This suggests that the known solution structure of the

7 the receptor is pre-configured in the same conformation as that in the docked state, with U19 unstacked and Mg2C bound to the pocket formed by A18, U19, and G20 (Figure 4). Thermodynamic principles dictate that DG8 Z DG8 C DG8 , where DG8 1 2 1 represents the standard state free energy difference between the free receptor and the TLR-Mg state. The hypothetic TLR-Mg state belongs to a group of receptor states with U19 unstacked in the presence of Mg2C alone. It was not detected via EPR spectra, and therefore is of higher free energy than the free receptor (DG8 O 0; Figure 4). Conse1 quently, DG8 Z DG8 K DG8 ! DG8 (or jDG8 jO jDG8 j, 2 1 2 as both DG8 and DG8 are negative). This leads to the 2 conclusion that extensive RNA­RNA interactions between the tetraloop and the receptor can be made (large magnitude of DG8 ), yet the overall affinity 2 remains relatively low (smaller magnitude of DG8). This is favorable for high specificity, as loss of any of the RNA­RNA interactions will have a more detrimental effect due to the relatively low overall affinity. It should be noted that the above discussion relies entirely on the property of free energy being a state variable, and does not depend on the pathway of tetraloop docking. In other RNA tertiary interactions, such as the kink-turn,30 Mg2C-dependent base unstacking and conformational changes have been reported. The principles revealed in the tetraloop-receptor system might be generally applicable to this class of RNA tertiary interactions. Conclusions The data presented above provide evidence that mobility in a thio-U linked nitroxide is coupled to RNA base dynamics in the 0.1­50 ns regime, and demonstrate the capability of SDSL to detect RNA conformational changes in solution through changes in base dynamics. SDSL studies of the TLR­TL interaction in the presence of Mg2C provide the first evidence that base-unstacking takes place in an isolated receptor in solution upon complex formation with a tetraloop, and that the structural features are similar to that observed in a crystal structure. Finally, it is shown that TLR­Mg2C interactions alone are not sufficient to populate states with an unstacked base to a detectable level, a result that is compatible with a high specificity for the tetraloop­receptor interaction.

free receptor, which was determined in the presence of NaC alone,24 is maintained upon addition of Mg2C. Energetics of the tetraloop­receptor interaction The SDSL studies presented here provide two pieces of new information regarding tetraloop­ receptor interaction. First, in an isolated tetraloop receptor in solution, formation of the TLR­TL complex is accompanied by unstacking of U19. In the crystal structure of a TLR­TL receptor complex, the equivalent base was also unstacked, but intermolecular interactions with another unstacked base in the neighboring RNA could be responsible for stabilizing the structure.2 The results provided here demonstrate that the unstacked conformation is an intrinsic feature of the complex formation. Second, Mg2C alone is not sufficient to stabilize any unstacked conformation to a level detectable in the EPR spectra, even with a Mg2C concentration as high as 0.125 M. As previously reported, TL alone also shows low affinity for TLR in the absence of Mg2C.11 Apparently, the free energy of formation of the TLR conformation corresponding to the bound form is sufficiently high that a favorable binding free energy (negative) of both ligands is necessary for its stabilization. In the crystal structure of the P46 core domain, the receptor adopts the A-platform conformation and forms extensive RNA­RNA interactions with the tetraloop.2 These interactions are likely absent between the tetraloop and the free receptor, which adopts an A-zipper configuration.24 Therefore, the measured affinity between tetraloop and free receptor (DG8) is not equivalent to the stabilization energy contributed by these RNA­RNA interactions that are present in the final docked state ðDG8 Þ. Thermodynamically, DG8 is equivalent to the 2 2 standard state free energy of formation when the tetraloop binds to a hypothetic TLR-Mg state, where

Figure 4. Energetics of the tetraloop­receptor interaction. In the reference state (TLRCMgCTL), the receptor adopts the A-zipper configuration24 and does not interact with the tetraloop or Mg2C. The TLR-Mg state is a hypothetical state where the receptor adopts the A-platform configuration,2 but does not interact with the tetraloop. The complex state is taken as the tetraloopreceptor shown in the crystal structure.2 It should be noted that the tetraloop conformations in all these states are the same.2
