Uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP) synthase contains two sequential catalytic activities for the synthesis of orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP) from orotate (EC 2.4.2.10, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase) and the decarboxylation of OMP to form UMP (EC 4.1.1.23, OMP decarboxylase). Previous kinetic studies had indicated that partial channeling of OMP might occur [T. W. Traut and M. E. Jones (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252,8374-83811; in the presence of a nucleotidase, there was no measurable formation of orotidine from OMP under conditions where OMP was maintained at a steady-state concentration [T. W. Traut (1980) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 200,590-5941. Recently claims were made that (i) the steady-state activities of UMP synthase could be modeled by Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and (ii) the nucleotidase activity in Ehrlich ascites cells was insufficient to degrade any significant amount of OMP [R. W. McClard and K. M. Shokat (1987) Biochemistry 26,3378-33841. The present studies show that UMP synthase has cooperative kinetics toward OMP, and that a substrate cycle involving orotate phosphoribosyltransferase, cytoplasmic nucleotidase, and uridine phosphorylase maintains the cyclic interconversion: orotate -N OMP + orotidine + orotate, etc. It is therefore the complex steadystate kinetics of UMP synthase in the presence of OMP, and the existence of a substrate cycle that account for the results which were interpreted as channeling in the earlier studies. 0 1989 Academic Press, Inc.

The final two catalytic steps for the de nova synthesis of UMP are orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (PRTase)' and OMP decarboxylase (Fig. 1). In mammals these two catalytic activities are on a single protein, UMP synthase (1). In the absence of ligands UMP synthase (subunit ikl, 51,500) exists as a monomer with an szo,w of 3.6; various anions produce aggregation to a 5.1 S dimer, while certain nucleotides, especially the substrate OMP, produce a 5.6 S

dimer (2, 3). Kinetic studies showed that the UMP synthase monomer has insignificant OMP decarboxylase activity, and only the 5.6 S dimer (produced in the presence of OMP) has full decarboxylase activity (4). It was also shown that the product OMP can produce activation, rather than the expected inhibition, of the orotate PRTase activity (2). UMP synthase is therefore a bifunctional protein of at least three polymeric or conformational states whose activities are regulated by OMP, the product of the first catalytic activity and the substrate for the second catalytic activity. In bacteria and yeast these two enzyme activities are found on separate gene products (5). In an attempt to justify the more

complex organization of the two activities in mammals, kinetic studies were interpreted as evidence for the partial channeling of OMP (2), especially as no formation of orotidine was detected under conditions where OMP was maintained at a steadystate level in the presence of a nucleotidase activity (6). This was challenged by McClard and Shokat who, without any direct experiments, used computer simulations to conclude that there was insufficient nucleotidase activity to degrade any significant amount of OMP, and that the catalytic activities of UMP synthase could be represented by a simple Michaelis-Menten model (7). Because of the importance of competing enzymes, the present work was done with impure preparations of UMP synthase containing all the enzyme activities shown in Fig. 1. It is shown that the OMP decarboxylase has complex kinetics as a function of OMP concentrations, and that there is evidence for a substrate cycle by which OMP, which has been dephosphorylated by a nucleotidase to orotidine, is recycled to orotate.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Methods. Cell extracts were prepared from Ehrlich ascites cells as described previously (6) and contained Tris-HCl, 20 mM (pH 7.4 at 37°C) and dithiothreitol, 2 mM. The activities of UMP synthase and related enzymes were measured as described previously (6, 8). Substrate cycling experiments were performed in a final volume of 50 ~1, containing Tris-HCl, 20 mM (pH 7.4 at 37°C); dithiothreitol, 2 mM; MgClz, 5 mM; P-RibPP at 100 or 1 fiM as described in figure legends, and [5-aH]orotate (0.3 Ci/mmol) at 1 PM. The reaction was started by the addition of a 24-~1 aliquot of the enzyme sample (216 gg protein). Samples were removed from the reaction mixture at the indicated times, and metabolites were separated by thin-layer chromatography (6) on polyethyleneimine plates, where the migration of compounds had the following Rf values: uridine and uracil, 0.82; orotidine, 0.66; orotate, 0.50; of unUMP, 0.26; and OMP, 0.04. Cochromatography labeled carrier allowed compounds to be detected unlight; sample spots were cut out and der ultraviolet quantitated by scintillation counting. For kinetic experiments with OMP decarboxylase, a partially purified enzyme preparation (sp act 0.3 protein) was used as previously denmol/min/mg scribed (3). Previous studies (3, 4) had been interpreted as evidence for an allosteric site where the substrate OMP also acted as an activator. The present kinetic studies extend the former studies to much lower OMP concentrations to determine whether nonhyperbolic kinetics could be observed with the substrate OMP. Reaction volumes were scaled up to 10 ml to increase the amount of total WO, product that could be obtained, and performed at 37°C as previously described (4). The concentration of the [7i4C1 OMP was determined using the molar extinction coefficient, czc7= 9420 M-' cm-`. OMP concentrations were varied between 1.4 nM and 5 fiM; a range of 5-143 nM was used most frequently. To maintain initial rate conditions, the conversion of substrate to product never exceeded 8%; therefore, reaction times were varied in accordance to the enzyme concentration (both are noted in figure legends. [7-`%]OMP (35 Ci/ mol) was used without mixing with unlabeled OMP. All reactions were performed in quadruplicate, since at the lowest concentration of OMP the measured product was only about 1.2 pmol(75 cpm above background). The background was determined over the full range of OMP concentrations in the presence of denatured enzyme. Kinetic constants were calculated by iterative calculations of a linear regression program (9). RESULTS

Mat&&. P-Rib-PP, orotate, orotidine, OMP, UMP, uridine, and 6-azaUMP were supplied by Sigma Chemical Co. [5-3H]Orotate was purchased from New England Nuclear. Polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (20 X 20 cm) were from Brinkman. All other commercial reagents were of the best grade available.

230 nM (3). These complex kinetics and lower L0.5 values for OMP have been observed in four separate experiments. This apparent change in the affinity for OMP at different enzyme concentrations may correspond to the conformational changes that UMP synthase exhibits as a dissociating enzyme, for the process of association/ dissociation would be expected to be sensitive to enzyme concentration. While the diluted enzyme appears to have a higher affinity for OMP, it has a sigdecreased activity. After nornificantly malizing for the protein concentration, the V,,, (at high OMP concentrations) for the diluted enzyme (Fig. 2A) is only 10% of the enzyme Vmax for the more concentrated (Fig. 2B). Since the diluted enzyme is more likely to be dissociated, this result is consistent with the earlier observation that UMP synthase monomers have no OMP decarboxylase activity (4). Substrate Cycling and Orotidine Involving Orotate, OMP,

low concentrations of its product OMP (2). Studies were therefore done to define the kinetics of OMP decarboxylase at low OMP concentrations. The enzyme shows complex kinetics that vary as a function of OMP concentration (Fig. 2A), and also as a function of enzyme concentration (Fig. 2B). At OMP concentrations below 3 nM, OMP decarboxylase shows negative cooperativity, while at OMP concentrations greater than 10 nM, there is evidence for positive cooperativity. At a greater concentration of enzyme (Fig. 2B), these complex kinetics have largely disappeared, though the Lineweaver-Burk plot is not actually linear and still suggests some degree of positive cooperativity at OMP concentrations above 7 nM. To maintain initial velocities, it was not practical with the increased enzyme (Fig. 2B) to measure kinetics below 5 nM OMP, where negative cooperativity had been observed with the more dilute enzyme. An unexpected result in the present experiment was that the affinity for OMP appears stronger at low enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2A; L0.5 = 31 nM). At the higher enzyme concentration the L0.5 = 231 nM (Fig. 2B), a value quite comparable to earlier studies where the Kmapp for OMP was

In earlier experiments it had been observed that small transient pools of OMP formed from orotate plus P-Rib-PP by UMP synthase apparently were not degraded to orotidine, while a similarly small pool of UMP was converted to uridine and possibly uracil (the two compounds move together on TLC). This had been interpreted as support for channeling of OMP (6). An alternative explanation for the failure to see the expected degradation of OMP to orotidine is that a substrate cycle might reconvert such orotidine back to orotate, the initial substrate. Experiments to explore this possibility are shown in Figs. 3A3C. Using the scheme diagrammed in Fig. 1, azaUMP was included to block almost totally the OMP decarboxylase activity (Reaction 2), and for the experiments of Figs. 3B and 3C, 50 mM phosphate was added to stimulate uridine phosphorylase activity (Reaction 4). Figure 3A shows the control experiment (no phosphate added), where orotate was rapidly converted to OMP. The OMP, in turn, was steadily dephosphorylated to orotidine. The orotate was totally

The fate of OMP synthesized from labeled or&ate was followed under different conditions to test for the substrate cycle depicted in Fig. 1; the inclusion of azaUMP effectively blocked the decarboxylase activity.

depleted by 10 min, and remained unchanged thereafter, indicating that under these conditions the PRTase reaction (Reaction 1) was not reversible.3 Because the azaUMP inhibition of OMP decarboxylase is quite effective, only a small amount of UMP was formed. This low concentration of UMP was steadily converted to uridine (and perhaps uracil). Inorganic phosphate should be generated from the PP1, produced by the PRTase, as well as from the nucleotidase reaction. Therefore cycling of orotidine back to orotate by a phosphorylase activity could have occurred in the experiment of
a We had previously shown that the orotate PRTase is not only reversible, but that the equilibrium favors the synthesis of orotate from OMP (2). However in cell extracts there is an active pyrophosphatase that readily cleaves PPi and makes the PRTase unidirectional in vitro, and presumably in viva.

Fig. 3A, but would be difficult to detect because the reaction contained a loo-fold excess of the cosubstrate, P-Rib-PP, so that recycled orotate would immediately be reconverted to OMP. In the experiment of Fig. 3B, 50 mM phosphate was added, which should have two effects: inhibit nucleotidase activity (leading to decreased orotidine formation) and stimulate phosphorylase activity (leading to increased conversion of orotidine to orotate). The results in Fig. 3B show that OMP was degraded less rapidly. Orotate was never totally depleted, as in Fig. 3A, and in fact started slowly to increase after 20 min, consistent with cycling of OMP back to orotate by Reactions 3 and 4 of Fig. 1. Under the experimental conditions of Fig. 3B, orotidine levels again remained low as the excess P-Rib-PP and added Pi helped to convert most of the orotidine to orotate and back to OMP.

In the experiment of Fig. 3C conditions were the same as for Fig. 3B, except that the initial P-Rib-PP was reduced to < 1 PM, so that cycling could not be maintained for the total time course.4 Here it is evident that at the lower concentrations of OMP attained, very little of it was converted to UMP. Instead, with the lower concentration of P-Rib-PP insufficient to support continuous cycling, the OMP that was formed was steadily reconverted to orotate, which at the end of the experiment had almost regained its initial concentration. Although the conversion of OMP to orotate in the experiments of Figs. 3B and 3C can only go through orotidine as the intermediate, the concentration of orotidine was maintained at very low levels because the phosphorylase activity (depletion of orotidine) is greater than the nucleotidase activity (formation of orotidine) under these conditions (Table I). To complete these substrate cycling studies, the experiment shown in Fig. 4 was done to show that OMP could be converted back to orotate via Reactions 3 and 4 of Fig. 1. No PPi was present, so that this formation of orotate from OMP could not be by the PRTase reaction. It can be seen

in Fig. 4 that OMP was readily dephosphorylated to orotidine, which was further converted to orotate. Orotidine and orotate soon reach steady-state concentrations that reflect the equilibrium of the phosphorylase reaction (Reaction 4 of Fig. 1). In this experiment the concentration of cycled compounds was lo-fold greater than for the experiments of Figs. 3A-3C, to allow orotidine to be more easily measured.

netic studies between the two catalytic centers more difficult to interpret. For the current studies, a partially purified preparation was therefore used to keep the two catalytic centers at their kinetic optimum, as well as to include the competing enzyme activities that were likely participants in substrate cycling. Instead of the expected inhibition by the product OMP, earlier studies had shown that the orotate PRTase was clearly activated in the presence of low concentrations of OMP (2). The present studies with the OMP decarboxylase activity show complex kinetics at low concentrations of OMP, which are more pronounced when the concentration of enzyme is low (Fig. 2). Negative cooperativity has frequently been observed for OMP decarboxylase from different sources: biphasic kinetics were reported for the enzyme from yeast and rat liver (lo), from human fibroblasts (ll), and from human hemolysate (12); triphasic kinetics were reported for the enzyme from human erythrocytes (13, 14). Apparent negative cooperativity is sometimes the additive result of subpopulations of enzyme that vary in their intrinsic Km, and the human erythrocyte preparation that showed triphasic kinetics also contained three separate molecular weight forms with OMP decarboxylase activity (13). However, all studies on UMP synthase from Ehrlich ascites cells are consistent with there being only one major form of UMP synthase in these cells. The present experiments are the first to show both positive and negative cooperativity, with the negative cooperativity occurring at the lowest concentrations of OMP (~5 nM). In previous studies negative cooperativity had been observed only at much higher OMP concentrations in the range of 2-30 pM (10-14). We had earlier shown that UMP synthase exists as a monomer in the absence of effecters, and that full OMP decarboxylase activity is observed only when the enzyme forms a dimer in the presence of OMP, or its analogs (2,4). The positive cooperativity seen in the present kinetic studies is consistent with these earlier studies, as is the observation

that cooperativity is less pronounced at a higher concentration of enzyme (Fig. 2B) where formation of the active dimer would occur more readily. Intracellular steadystate concentrations of OMP have been reported to be about 70 nM (15). The present kinetic studies over an OMP range of 5-140 nM are therefore quite appropriate, and the complex kinetics observed as a function of OMP may have some relevance to the behavior of UMP synthase in vivo. Substrate Cycling with UMP Synthase The unusual kinetics of UMP synthase are not sufficient to explain the earlier experimental results where conversion of steady-state OMP to orotidine was not detected (6). M&lard and Shokat have activity claimed that the nucleotidase from Ehrlich ascites cells was inadequate for the formation of orotidine at such low concentrations of OMP (7). However, the observed activity of nucleotidase(s) in the earlier study (6) and in the present experiments (Figs. 3 and 4) was sufficient to degrade OMP even when it was below micromolar. The existence of a substrate cycle is supported by the present study, and accounts for the fact that OMP can be dephosphorylated without the accumulation of significant amounts of orotidine, because the latter is efficiently reconverted to orotate. When P-Rib-PP was in excess (Figs. 3A and 3B), recycled orotate was converted again to OMP, maintaining the substrate cycle. When P-Rib-PP was limiting, the cycle could not be maintained and orotate became the end product. Could such a substrate cycle operate in vivo? Table I shows that the various enzyme activities involved all have generally comparable activities in initial rate studies, although the phosphorylase activity is clearly the highest. Therefore, some cycling of orotate + OMP + Ord + orotate, etc., could be expected to occur in vivo. Such cycles were often termed futile cycles in the past, but it has been shown how they may be useful in regulating certain metabolic pathways such as glycolysis (16). In

nucleotide metabolism regulation of dNTP pools includes rapid catabolism to deoxynucleosides in a substrate cycle (17), and regulation of ATP includes a substrate cycle between AMP and adenosine in liver (18). These two cycles both involve a cytoplasmic nucleotidase in the catabolic component, as does the cycle in the present study. It is not yet clear to what extent a substrate cycle involving OMP may occur in vivo, although there has been some support for this (19). A simpler cycle, involving only the nucleotidase and a kinase (Fig. 1, Reactions 3 and 5) is not likely, for we have previously shown that orotidine is a very poor substrate for uridine kinase, as indicated by the dashed arrow in Fig. 1 (20). For the more likely three enzyme cycle, the nucleotidase would be expected to be the limiting member, since this enzyme has relatively high K, values for nucleo(0.2-6 mM), dependsides-monophosphate ing on the source for enzyme and the nucleotide. Although a nucleotidase specific for OMP has been reported, this enzyme also had a very high K, for OMP (1 mM) and an activity comparable to the general nucleotidase in Table I (21). Since the uridine phosphorylase has a Km for nucleosides that is much lower (range = 16-65 PM (22, 23)) and the highest activity, it is likely that it can cleave orotidine to orotate at a rate sufficient to keep orotidine from accumulating. Therefore, the fact that orotidine is often not detectable in vivo, and was not measurable under steady-state conditions in cell extracts (6) is not inconsistent with it being part of a substrate cycle, since in the present experiments (Figs. 3B and 3C) orotidine concentrations were barely measurable under conditions where OMP was recycled to orotate. Conclusions The present results on substrate cycling show that the steady-state OMP must equilibrate to some extent with the bulk solvent since the OMP is subject to dephosphorylation. Such results are inconsistent with the earlier interpretation that OMP

was being partially channeled, because it appeared to be spared from nucleotidase activity (2). No conclusions should be made at this time as to whether the substrate cycling of OMP has a regulatory significance, as proposed for the other substrate cycles in nucleotide metabolism (17, 18). However, it is worth noting that while carbamoylphosphate synthase is the committed, and regulated, enzyme that initiates the de nouo synthesis of UMP (5), the normal cellular activity of orotate PRTase is nearly identical to the activity of carbamoylphosphate synthase (5), and there are conditions under which orotate PRTase may become the rate-limiting step in the de ncwo pyrimidine pathway (24), suggesting that regulation of this step may also become significant. Consistent with this suggestion are the complex kinetic and regulatory properties of UMP synthase: (i) the two catalytic centers reside on a single protein (1); (ii) OMP appears to be an allosteric activator for OMP decarboxylase activity (3); (iii) OMP decarboxylase shows complex kinetics at low OMP concentrations and low enzyme concentrations (Fig. 2); (iv) orotate PRTase activity is activated by low concentrations of OMP (2), phosphate,5 and ADP (24). The Michaelis-Menten assumptions used in recent computer modeling of UMP synthase (7) appear insufficient to account for all of these observations.
