Structural studies of the spliceosome: blind men and an elephant
Andrew J Newman and Kiyoshi Nagai
Proteomic studies have shown that spliceosomal complexes are massive, dynamic ribonucleoprotein assemblies that undergo extensive remodelling and exchange of components as spliceosomes are constructed, activated and recycled. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed the overall shape of several spliceosomal complexes and the locations of key splicing factors. Over the last two years X-ray crystallography has produced the first detailed structure of a spliceosomal snRNP -- the U1 snRNP from human -- giving us important new insights into snRNP assembly and 50 splice site recognition. High-resolution structures of domains from the essential Brr2 and Prp8 splicing factors have shed new light on the mechanism of spliceosome activation and the interactions between Prp8 and the spliceosome's RNA core.

which are present in substoichiometric amounts [3­6]. It is therefore not realistic to crystallise and solve the structure of the entire spliceosome. One approach to gaining structural insights into the mechanism of splicing is to affinity purify spliceosomes stalled at a specific stage and determine their structure by electron cryo-microscopy. An alternative strategy is to analyse individual proteins or domains by X-ray crystallography or NMR. Better still, the crystal structures of multiprotein complexes or snRNA­protein assemblies should provide important insights into spliceosome functions.

Structure and function of human U1 snRNP
U1 snRNP recognises the short sequence at the 50 splice site of pre-mRNA and initiates assembly of the spliceosome. Metazoan U1 snRNP contains U1 snRNA (165 nucleotides), seven Sm proteins (SmB/B0 , SmD3, SmD1, SmD2, SmF, SmE and SmG) and three U1-specific proteins, namely U1-A, U1-70k and U1-C. U1 snRNA forms four stem­loop structures and U1-70k and U1-A bind to loops 1 and 2, whereas U1-C does not bind to free U1 snRNA (Figure 1). The 50 end of U1 snRNA base pairs with the short sequence at the 50 splice site of pre-mRNA and U1-C is crucial for the recognition of the 50 splice site [7]. U1-A protein has two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) linked by a sequence that is predicted to be disordered. U1-70k is a 54 kDa protein with one RRM between residues 100 and 180. The sequence of the first 215 residues is conserved between yeast and human, implying an essential function. In contrast the C-terminal region has diverged considerably: it is predicted to be largely unstructured, to undergo reversible phosphorylation and to bind constitutive and alternative splicing factors. Over the years we have reported the structure of some of the U1 proteins individually or as RNA­protein or protein­protein complexes [8­11]. Building on this foundation we succeeded in reconstituting U1 snRNP from recombinant proteins and in vitro transcribed U1 snRNA. These reconstituted snRNPs lack only the Cterminal unstructured parts of U1-70k, U1-C and SmB/B0 , and we showed that they bind 50 splice sites [8]. Human U1 snRNP is active in splicing assays in vitro even when U1-A is depleted or stem­loop 2 including the binding site for U1-A is deleted [12]. We recently reported the crystal structure of the functional core of human U1 snRNP in which part of stem­loop 2 was replaced by a kissing loop to promote crystal contacts (Figure 1b) [13]. The crystals of this functional core of U1 snRNP dif° fracted to 5.5 A resolution and were initially phased with a tantalum bromide heavy atom cluster. The map improved

Introduction
The spliceosome is a large RNA­protein assembly that catalyses the removal of introns from mRNA precursors (pre-mRNA). Five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs) assemble onto pre-mRNA substrates together with non-snRNP proteins. The binding of U1 snRNP to the 50 splice site in premRNA is followed by ATP-dependent binding of the U2 snRNP to the branch point sequence within the intron to produce a pre-spliceosome (Complex A). Addition of a preassembled U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP to Complex A produces a pre-catalytic spliceosome (Complex B), which is remodelled extensively to yield the catalytically active particle (Complexes B* and C). A network of RNA interactions, involving the U2, U5 and U6 snRNAs and the pre-mRNA, lies at the heart of the active spliceosome [1,2]. Proteomic studies show that the spliceosome is a massive RNP particle containing over a hundred proteins, some of

Protein and RNA components of human U1 snRNP. (a) U1 snRNP contains seven Sm proteins and three U1-specific proteins. Sequence motifs found in these proteins are indicated. The first 215 residues of U1-70k are conserved from yeast to human but the C-terminal half has diverged considerably. The Cterminal region is predicted to be unstructured and known to contain binding sites for constitutive and alternative splicing factors. The Ser-Arg (SR) repeats found in the C-terminal region undergo reversible phosphorylation and bind splicing factors containing SR repeats (SR proteins). The C-terminal region of SmB/B0 and U1-C contains PXMGXXPP motifs, which bind a WD40 domain of an alternative splicing factor, FBP21. (b) Secondary structure of human U1 snRNA. The 50 end of U1 snRNA (orange box) binds to the conserved sequence at the 50 splice site of pre-mRNA. Seven Sm proteins assemble around the Sm site (green box) located between stem­loops 3 and 4. In the crystal structure stem­loop 2 is replaced by a kissing loop.

substantially after including data from derivatives and multi-crystal, multi-domain averaging [14]. The major and minor grooves of RNA duplex were discernible and the structure of the U4 snRNP core domain (solved independently: Leung et al., unpublished results), the NMR structure of the U1-C Zn finger and a homology model of the RBD of U1-70K were readily fitted into the electron density map using anomalous peaks of zinc and SeMet-labelled proteins as landmarks. U1 snRNA upstream of the Sm site forms a four-way junction where stem­loops 1 and 2 coaxially stack and stem­loop 3 and helix H also form a coaxially stacked helix. Stem­loop 4 protrudes from the opposite face of the core domain (Figure 2a). Individual Sm proteins were readily assigned based on their SeMet anomalous peaks.

The N-terminal helix and the five-stranded b-sheet of the Sm fold of seven Sm proteins are fitted well into the map (Figure 2b). A long N-terminal extension of SmD2 forms an extra a-helix that points into the minor groove of helix H. The N-terminal helix of SmB also interacts with the phosphate backbone of stem­loop 2. These interactions stabilise the four-way junction onto the core domain. The RNA-binding domain of U1-70k binds to stem­loop 1 and the region between residues 60 and 90 forms an a-helix that runs along stem­loop 1. The first 67 residues of U170k are necessary and sufficient for the binding U1-C to the U1 core domain [15]. The location of this region of U1-70k was not initially obvious. To trace the path of the first 60 residues of U1-70k, crystals of seven SeMet derivatives of U1 snRNP were grown, each with a SeMet-labelled form of single methionine mutants of

U1-70K [13,14]. The N-terminal region of U1-70k extends from the long a-helix, wraps around the core domain and extends to U1-C. The electron density map suggests that the N-terminal end of U1-70k and the Cterminal end of SmD3 form short a-helices and contact the long a-helix of U1-C protein (Figure 2a). This explains why the N-terminal part of U1-70k is necessary for the binding of U1-C to the U1 core domain [15]. In our crystal the 50 end of U1 snRNA is paired with its counterpart from a neighbouring complex. This fortuitous interaction mimics the binding of pre-mRNA to U1 snRNP. Helix A of U1-C binds across the minor groove of this RNA duplex (Figure 2c). The polypeptide loop between the two Zn-coordinating His residues is close to the pre-mRNA strand and the conserved Arg21-Lys22 on Helix A and Arg28-Lys29 in the loop may be involved in the interaction with the phosphate backbone. A double mutant of U1-C (R28G, K29S) fails to promote E complex formation [12]. The structure is consistent with the essential role of U1-C in facilitating the binding of the 50 splice site to U1 snRNP to form E complex [7]. The U1 crystal structure has revealed the architecture of a spliceosomal snRNP and provided important insights into the mechanism of 50 splice site recognition.

attention recently as it has become clear that they play essential inter-related roles in the formation, activation and remodelling of the spliceosome's catalytic core. Brr2 is a DExH-box ATPase that unwinds dsRNA in vitro and likely provides the driving force for disrupting U4/U6 RNA helices during catalytic activation of the spliceosome [16­18]. Brr2 activity is regulated by the cooperative action of the Snu114 GTPase and Prp8 [19­21], and indeed these three proteins interact extensively with each other [22­24]. Prp8 is the largest and most highly conserved spliceosomal protein -- 2400 residues and 61% identity between yeast and human -- yet the primary sequence reveals few motifs that might provide clues to its biochemical functions. UV cross-linking data have shown that Prp8 directly contacts the 50 and 30 splice sites and the branch site, as well as crucial nucleotides in U5 and U6 snRNAs. Together with a wealth of genetic data this demonstrates that Prp8 is intimately involved with the spliceosome's catalytic core [25,26]. Recent high-resolution structures of domains from the Prp8 and Brr2 proteins have provided important new insights into the functions of these essential splicing factors. The crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of Prp8 from C. elegans and S. cerevisiae reveal a Jab1/MPN-like core previously encountered in subunits of several multiprotein complexes [27­29] (Figure 3).

Figure 3

Structures of the RNaseH-like domain and Jab1/MPN-like domain of the U5 snRNP protein Prp8. The cartoon in the centre shows an overview of the domains and motifs in Prp8. The RNaseH-like domain structure (top) shows residues 1822­2095 of yeast Prp8 [35] with the b-finger and the site of a 50 splice site RNA­protein cross-link highlighted [33,34,35,39]. The Jab1/MPN-like domain structure (bottom) shows residues 2147­2397 of yeast Prp8 [27]. Several residues corresponding to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) mutations in hPrp8 are shown as sticks. Mutations at these positions and at G2347 affect the interactions of the Brr2 and/or Snu114 proteins with Prp8 [24,27,29].

this module functions in deubiquitination as a Zn-dependent isopeptidase, but in Prp8 the canonical Znbinding residues are absent. Biochemical and genetic data show that in Prp8 the Jab1/MPN-like module acts instead as a specialized protein­protein interaction domain specific for the Brr2 and Snu114 components of U5 snRNP. Despite its subversion into a protein interaction platform and the absence of Zn-coordinating residues, the extended Prp8 Jab1/MPN-like module nevertheless binds ubiquitin [30]. Interestingly other domains related to the ubiquitin pathway have been identified in diverse spliceosomal proteins (for review see [31]). The extreme C-terminus of Prp8 from human harbours mutations that result in retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative disease of the retina [26]. In the crystal structure these RP mutations map to a C-terminal extension grafted onto the surface of the Jab1/MPN-like

module (Figure 3). Targeted two-hybrid assays of protein interactions showed that RP mutations interfere with the binding of Brr2 and/or Snu114, identifying a likely underlying molecular basis for this form of RP [27]. Furthermore functional analysis in yeast has identified a novel U5 snRNP precursor particle that accumulates in the nucleus when Prp8­Brr2 interactions are disrupted by RP mutations, suggesting that RP may relate to defective U5 snRNP maturation [32]. In 2008 three groups presented the crystal structures of a 270 residue domain near the C-terminus of Prp8 -- just upstream of the Jab1/MPN-like module -- revealing a conserved RNaseH-like fold bearing a `b-finger' insertion between its first and second b strands [33,34,35] (Figure 3). This hairpin-like b-finger is reminiscent of extensions protruding from the main bodies of ribosomal proteins such as S10 and L22. In the ribosome such protrusions insert into the 16S and 23S rRNAs and

stabilize the RNA structure. Clues to the possible functions of the b-finger in the spliceosome come from the presence of multiple mutations throughout this structure, that have been shown to affect the transition between first step and second step conformations in activated spliceosomes [36]. In addition mutations at the base of the bfinger implicate this feature as a potential regulator of U4/ U6 unwinding during spliceosome activation [37]. Functional RNaseH domains typically contain four conserved carboxylates in their active sites that coordinate Mg2+ ions critical for the catalysis of RNA cleavage [38]. The Prp8 RNaseH-like domain contains an incomplete set of metal-chelating residues and is apparently unable to bind Mg2+ ions, echoing the situation of Prp8's Jab1/ MPN domain with respect to Zn2+ ions. Nevertheless UV cross-linking experiments have identified a contact between the substrate's 50 splice site and the Prp8 RNaseHlike domain in human Complex B spliceosomes, that is pre-catalytic complexes before the U4/U6 unwinding step [39]. Indeed modelling of the potential RNA interactions of the Prp8 RNaseH-like domain -- based on the structure of an RNaseH­DNA­RNA complex [38] -- placed the virtual 50 splice site close to the observed cross-link in a cleft next to the b finger. Further analysis should clarify the precise functions of the Prp8 RNaseHlike domain. At present the data are consistent with a role in structuring or organizing essential elements of the RNA network at the heart of the spliceosome and potentially in positioning the 50 splice site for catalysis. The Brr2 DExH-box ATPase contains two helicase-like domains: the N-terminal copy is essential for ATPase activity, U4/U6 unwinding and viability in yeast, whereas
Figure 4

the helicase motifs in the C-terminal copy tolerate mutations with little consequence [16]. Each helicaselike domain is connected to a downstream Sec63-like domain of unknown function, and recently the crystal structures of the second Sec63-like domain from yeast and human Brr2 have been solved. They reveal unexpected similarity to domains 4 + 5 of Hel308, an archaeal DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and recombination [40,41,42,43]. Sequence comparisons and structural modelling suggest that Brr2 likely contains 2 Hel308-like modules [Hel308-1 and Hel308-2], suggesting that Brr2 could use a similar helicase mechanism to Hel308. The Hel308-2 module of Brr2 interacts with Prp8 and Snu114, arguing that Hel308-2 must modulate the helicase activity of Hel308-1 [23,24,42,43]. Indeed a Cterminal fragment of Prp8 -- encompassing the RNaseH-like and Jab/MPN1-like domains -- strongly stimulates Brr2-dependent U4/U6 unwinding in vitro [44]. It has also been shown that Prp8 from isolated U4/U6.U5 trisnRNPs is ubiquitinated, and that manipulation of ubiquitin's downstream functions can inhibit U4/U6 unwinding [31]. This points to an additional mode of Brr2 regulation distinct from control by the Snu114 GTPase [21]. Perhaps Prp8­ubiquitin conjugation is recognized via the Jab1/MPN-like domain [30] and this modulates Prp8­Brr2 interactions. In any case these new insights into Brr2 functions gained from structural and biochemical analysis have laid the foundations for further advances in our understanding of spliceosome dynamics.

to the C-terminus of a specific protein [45]. The particles were observed in a unique orientation on the EM carbon film and hence the projection structure of negatively stained particles was obtained. The particles appear to have a Y-shaped structure comprising head, foot and arm domains. It was possible to localize the tag attached to key subunits (Prp8, Brr2, Snu114, Prp31, Prp6, Prp3 and LSm8) within this structure, visualized either directly or indirectly using protein A-coated colloidal gold bound to the tag via CBP-specific antibody (Figure 4). Brr2 is located in the head domain whereas Prp8 and Snu114 are found between the foot and head domains. The arm domain containing Lsm8 and Prp3 is connected to the main body through the linker region containing Prp6 and Prp31. Yeast tri-snRNP is predominantly in two alternative conformations: closed and open forms. In the closed form Brr2 may be in contact with U4/U6 snRNP in the arm domain such that the substrate U4/U6 snRNA duplex may come into contact with Brr2 RNA helicase. Snu114 located in the hinge region may act as a two-way switch between open and closed forms, depending on GTP/ GDP-binding state. Attempts to locate various RNA elements and protein components with human tri-snRNP were reported before [46].

and the intron sequence flanking the branch point are buried in C complex whereas the entire 30 exon including the mutated 30 splice site dinucleotide is accessible.

Conclusion
In the most favourable case of stable and highly symmetric icosahedral virus cryo-EM can provide structural ° information comparable to 4 A resolution X-ray structure [50]. For macromolecular assemblies with no symmetry, such as the ribosome, single particle electron cryo-microscopy has reached an estimated resolution ° of 6­7 A [51]. At this resolution the major and minor grooves of RNA helices and a-helices of proteins are easily discernible, so it would be possible to fit X-ray structures into cryo-EM envelopes. However, the structure of various intermediates of the spliceosome has so ° far been limited to a resolution of 20­30 A: at this resolution it is not possible to fit known structures into the EM envelope based on structural data alone. This limitation is due to both compositional and structural heterogeneity of the specimen. The resolution could be improved substantially if the specimen could be fixed, ideally into a small number of conformations, allowing the structure of subclasses to be computationally sorted and refined. Despite current limitations cryo-EM analysis of spliceosomal intermediates has provided invaluable information on the rough shape of complexes. As summarised above attempts have been made to determine the location of specific proteins or RNA elements within the low-resolution structure of splicing complexes and the overall organisation of components is beginning to emerge. We have shown that it is possible to reconstitute human U1 snRNP from recombinant proteins and in vitro transcribed RNA and even a structure of medium resolution could provide invaluable informative in conjunction with site-specific labelling with heavy atoms. In principle it is possible to reconstitute other snRNPs from recombinant materials. Structural analysis of the spliceosome is still in its infancy but a combination of crystallography and cryo-EM will provide important structural information at an increasing rate [supplementary material].

Pre-mRNA substrate in B complex
B complex is formed by the addition of U4/U6.U5 trisnRNP to the pre-spliceosome (Complex A). B complex was assembled onto a pre-mRNA substrate which harbors tandem binding sites for MS2 phage coat protein within 50 exon, intron or 30 exon and subsequently purified on amylose resin using a fusion protein between MS2 phage coat protein and maltose binding protein. MS2 protein bound to pre-mRNA was visualized using MS2 coat protein specific antibody bound to protein A-coated colloidal gold [47] to visualize the site of entry of 50 exon, intron and 30 exon in B complex. The structure of B complex can be interpreted as a large globular domain bound to the head and arm domains of the tri-snRNP (Figure 4). The globular domain corresponds to Complex A, as SF3b155, a U2-specific protein, was mapped to its centre. The 50 exon, intron and 30 exon were also mapped to different areas of this domain. Because of the large spacing between the colloidal gold and antibody the sites where the substrate pre-mRNA enters the domain were mapped to a broad area.

However in contrast to canonical RNaseH domains, that typically contain four conserved carboxylates used to position catalytic metal ions, the Prp8 domain has an incomplete set of metal-chelating residues and failed to bind metal ions. 34.

This paper presents the crystal structure of the yeast Prp8 RNaseH-like domain, drawing particular attention to the `b-hairpin finger' that protrudes from the RNaseH-like core. The protruding b-finger resembles protrusions in ribosomal proteins that interact with 16S and 23S rRNAs and stabilize RNA structure in the ribosome. 36.

Nat Struct Mol Biol 2009, 16:731-739. These authors determined the crystal structure of the second Sec63 domain from the yeast Brr2 ATPase, revealing unexpected structural similarity to domains 4 and 5 of the Hel308 protein, a DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and recombination. Sequence comparisons and structural modelling suggest that Brr2 consists of an N-terminal domain of unknown structure linked to two consecutive Hel308-like modules. 43.
