Departments of Microbiology, Genetics and Development, and Neurology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY 10032, U.S.A. (First received 3 September 1991; accepted in revised form 26 November 1991) antibodies (Ab2s) were cloned and sequenced. They are encoded by different V, genes, two are from different members of VK-0x1 superfamily. The H chains are encoded by V, genes belonging to three different V, families, 5.558, Q52 and 7183. Together with a previous report from this laboratory, the nucleotide sequences of four Ab2s to anti-a(1 --*6)dextrans have been presented. They are derived from a number of unrelated germline genes, and differ from similar studies in anti-NP, anti-GAT and anti-Ars systems. Three of four Ab2s in the ant& (1 + 6)dextran system appear to have D-D fusions, which has also been reported in several other Ab2s.

Abstract-The variable regions of three syngeneic anti-idiotypic

INTRODUCTION Idiotypes are unique antigenic determinants on the Fv fragment of an antibody molecule (Oudin and Michel, 1963; Kunkel et al., 1963; Kabat, 1984). An idiotype may consist of several different determinants, called idiotopes which are three-dimensional structures recognized by an anti-idiotypic antibody. Idiotypic determinants (idiotopes) are usually associated with complementaritydetermining regions (CDR) and a given idiotope is found on only a small proportion of antibody molecules in serum. In contrast, V-region allotypic or framework determinants are found on a broad spectrum of antibody molecules (Mage et al., 1973; Eshhar et al., 1983). Anti-Fv antibodies may be specific for the combining site and inhibitable by a hapten, or may be specific for the framework determinants or some unoccupied portions of the CDRs and are not inhibitable (Helman et al., 1976). Native a( 14 6)dextran B5 12 is a homopolymer of glucose consisting of 96% a(1 -+ 6) linkages and 4% a(1 + 3) linkages at branch points (Jeanes et al., 1954; van Cleve et al., 1956). In exploring the repertoire of anti-at 1 + 6)dextrans, many mouse hybridomas and myeloma proteins with specificity for a(1 + 6)dextran have been studied (Cisar et al., 1975; Sharon et al., 1981; Newman and Kabat, 1985; Lai and Kabat, 1985; Chen et al., 1987; Matsuda and Kabat, 1989; Wang et al., 1990, 1991); some have been characterized idiotypically (Sharon et al., 1982~; Borden and Kabat, 1988; Perfetti et al., 1991). Immunochemical studies have classified the

binding sites of anti-a (1 + 6)dextran antibodies into two types: the groove-type which react with the internal, linear portion of dextran B512 not including the nonreducing termini, and the cavity-type which react with the terminal, non-reducing ends (Cisar et al., 1975; Davies and Metzger, 1983; Matsuda and Kabat, 1989). W3129 and QUPC52 are two myeloma proteins which serve as prototypes for cavity- and groove-type sites, respectively (Cisar et al., 1975). With one groove-type monoclonal anti-a( 1 + 6) dextran, 10.16.1 (Sharon et al., 19826), and a cavity-type myeloma, W3219, as immunogens, we have established four monoclonal syngeneic anti-idiotypes (Borden and Kabat, 1988). Three, 61.1E9.9, 61.10C2.8 and 48.2.1, are specific for many groove-type anti-dextran mAbs. Antiidiotype W5.1B4.4 recognizes only the cavity-type antidextran W3129. Anti-idiotypes 61.1E9.9,61.1OC2.8. and W5.1B4.4 formed specific precipitates in saline with anti-dextrans expressing the corresponding idiotopes, whereas 48.2.1 did not form precipitates with antia(1 + 6)dextran unless 3% PEG was added (Borden and Kabat, 1990). To aid in the interpretation of the immunochemical data and to try to relate immunochemical properties and the primary structure of the anti-idiotopes, we have determined the nucleotide sequences of the variable regions (V,, V,) of the heavy (H) and light (L) of these anti-idiotypic antibodies by cloning the cDNAs derived from the RNA made from the hybridoma cells. The sequences are presented here. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mouse monoclonal

immunized with purified BALB/c monoclonal antiLX --) 6)dextran 10.16.1 (c(, rc) and W5.1 B4.4 (y 3, rc) with (1 BALB/c myeloma W3129 (Borden and Kabat, 1988). Spleen cells were fused with non-producer myeloma cells P3.x63.Ag8.653 and screened using a nitrocellulose dot assay (Borden and Kabat, 1986). A BALB/c anti-idiotype 48.2.1 was derived as for 61.1E9.9 and 61.10C2.8, except that screening was done by ELISA (Borden and Kabat, 1988). Synthesis 61.10C2.8 of cDNA and cloning of 61.1E9.9 and

Total cellular RNA was extracted by the guanidium thiocyanate method (Chirgwin et al., 1979). Poly (A+) mRNA was isolated by oligo (dT) chromatography following established procedures (Aviv and Leder, 1972). cDNA of the V, and V, regions of the H and L chains were synthesized using specific oligonucleotides complementary to the coding strand of the 5' end of the constant region essentially as described by Levy et al. (1987). A 15-nucleotide K-primer 3'[acgtggttgacatag]S' was synthesized with an Applied Biosystems 380A DNA synthesizer (Foster City, CA, U.S.A.) by Drs A. Efstratiadis and A. Murphy. A 21-nucleotide y3 primer 3'[agacagatagggaaccaggga]5' was purchased from ChemGenes (Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). The doublestranded cDNA was dC-tailed and annealed to Pst I-cut, dG-tailed pUCl9 and transformed into competent Escherichia coli DHScr. Colonies with plasmids containing V, and V, cDNAs were identified by colony hybridization using J-region probes (Sikder et al., 1985) for both H and L chains. DNA sequencing of 6l.lE9.9 and 61.10C2.8

EcoRI to yield the insert labeled at one end; this was isolated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel, electroeluted, and used for sequencing in one direction. The other strand was sequenced in a similar way, except that it was first cut with EcoRI, labeled, and then cut with HindIII. Since it is difficult to get unequivocal sequences of both strands of clones longer than about 350 nucleotides, V, W5.1B4.4 cDNA in pUC9 was first cut with Asp718 at residues corresponding to amino acids 35 and 36, labeled, cut with either EcoRI or HindIII, and processed as above. In addition, an internal Dde I fragment comprising amino acids 11-85 of V, was isolated, the 5' end labeled, then cut with AflIII at residues corresponding to amino acids 33 and 34, and processed in the usual way before sequencing.
RESULTS

Minipreparations of plasmid DNA were made with the Qiagen Kit (Studio City, CA, U.S.A.). Double-strand sequencing was carried out according to the USB protocol for SEQUENASE (a modified T7 DNA polymerase, United States Biochemical Corporation, Cleveland, OH, U.S.A.). Both strands were sequenced completely. Synthesis of cDNA of 48.2.1. and W5.1 B4.4

Total RNA was extracted from hybridoma cells as 61.1E9.9 above. cDNA of V, and V, chains were synthesized as described (Sikder et al., 1985) with the specific primers used for 61.1 E9.9 and a 15-nucleotide y 1 primer 3'[cagataggtgaccgg]5' (a gift of Drs C. Bona and C. Victor-Kobrin, Mt Sinai Medical School, New York, NY, U.S.A.) for the V, chain of W5.1B4.4. The cDNA cloning followed a published procedure (Sikder et al., 1985). DNA sequencing of 48.2.1. and W5.1 B4.4

Both strands of cDNA inserts were sequenced by the Maxam and Gilbert method (1980). Approximately 10 pg of plasmid containing the double-stranded cDNA in the polylinker were cut with Hind111 and treated with phosphatase, and 5' ends were labeled with [y3'P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The linear labeled plasmid was cut on the other side of the polylinker with

The nucleotide sequences of both V, and V, of 61 .lOC2.8 are identical to that of 61.1E9.9 (data not shown). This is in accordance with the very similar immunochemical reactivity pattern of the two monoclonal anti-idiotypes (Borden and Kabat, 1988). Since these two hybridomas were derived from the same fusion and have the same V-region sequences, it is reasonable to believe that they actually represented the same clone. However, the anti-idiotypes 61.1 E9.9, 48.2.1 and WS.lB4.4 are quite different in both V, and V, sequences (Figs l-3). The V, segments of these three anti-idiotypes come from different mouse V, gene families (Figs 1 and 2). Identities of nucleotides among the V, regions of the three anti-idiotypes are only 5463%. V, 61 .iE9.9 (sequence shown in Fig. 1) is a member of the 5558 family and is 86% identical in nucleotide sequence to the related germline V23 gene of 5558 family (Bothwell et al., 1981; Maizels and Bothwell, 1985). The most related sequence to V, 61.1E9.9 is a cDNA sequence of 2H7, a mouse antibody whose V regions have been joined to human IgGl and kappa constant regions, resulting in a chimeric antibody with specificity to CD20 cell surface phosphoprotein (Liu A. Y. et al., 1987). The nucleotide sequence of V, 61.1E9.9 from codons 1 to 94 is 95% identical to the V, of 2H7. There are 12 amino acid differences between 61 .lE9.9 and 2H7, and 20 differences between 61 .lE9.9 and V23 which occur throughout the V, domain. From the amino acid sequences, V, of 61.1E9.9 together with 2H7 and V23 belong to subgroup IIB (Kabat et al., 1991). V, CDR3 of 61.1E9.9 has nine amino acids and seems to be formed by D-D fusion (see below). The cDNA sequence of V, 48.2.1 and its deduced amino acid sequence are compared with that of V, PJ14 germline gene (Fig. 1), derived from a mouse embryo DNA library (Sakano et al., 1980). There is 90% nucleotide identity between V, 48.2.1 and V, PJ14, a member of the 452 family. The V, 48.2.1 segment has 92% identity in nucleotides to VD2H9, an anti-DNA hybridoma made from a NZB/NZW mouse (Klotz et al., 1988). Among the nine amino acid differences between

Fig. 3. V, cDNA and derived amino acid sequences of 61.1E9.9, 48.2.1 and W5.1B4.4 compared with related germline genes (see text and legend of Fig. 1). The sequence of 5G2 is available only to amino acid 104 (Kaartinen et al., 1988).

the V, segments of 48.2.1 and VD2H9, six are in CDRl and CDR2. There are, however, more differences in V, CDR3 and the J, segments. CDR3 of 48.2.1 has 10 amino acids, and VD2H9 has only five; 48.2.1 uses JH4, whereas VD2H98 uses JH3. Although the VH segments expressed by 48.2.1 and VD2H9 belong to Q52 family, there are 24 and 31 nucleotide differences, respectively, when compared with PJ14. It is likely that they are encoded by some other V, germline gene of the 452 family. The V, W5.1B4.4 (Fig. 2) is a member of the 7183 family, the most J, -proximal group of germline V genes in BALB/c mice. It has 95% nucleotide identity from codons 1 to 94 to VH283, a germline sequence in the 7 183 family, isolated from a recombinant bacteriophage library containing BALB/c embryo DNA (0110 et al., 1983). There are 20 nucleotide differences between V, W5.1B4.4 and VH283, leading to 10 amino acid replacements, six in CDRI and CDR2. W5.1B4.4 has a 13 amino acid long V,., CDR3; its D region seems to result from recombination of two D minigenes (see below). The germline sequence of J, 1 segment of BALB/c is used.

The V, segment of W5.1B4.4 uses almost the same V, gene segment as H230-7, a hybridoma making antibody to the influenza virus hemagglutinin (Clarke et al., 1990). Only one amino acid differs (82A Ser +Asn) from amino acids 1 to 94, which may be due to a somatic mutation at the second nucleotide of codon 82A (g -+ a). In CDR3, W5.1B4.4 has 13 amino acids and J, 1 is used, whereas H230-7 has nine amino acids in CDR3 and J,4. The D segments of VH 61.1E9.9 and V, W5.1B4.4 appear to result from the joining of two D minigenes (Fig. 4). The 61.1E9.9 D segment may be derived from an inverted fusion between DSP2.3 and DSP2.7. This putative fused D region has an initial five nucleotides that may derive from the noncoding strand of DSP2.3 with a single nucleotide mutation, an inserted g, then six nucleotides from DSP2.7 followed by three bases of g that may represent N sequences. The D segment of W5.1B4.4 has 10 amino acids and is more likely to be derived from inverted fusion of DFL16.2 and DSP2.6 (Fig. 4). The fused D region consists of five nucleotides from the noncoding strand of

Fig. 4. Possible origins of V, CDR3 of 61.1E9.9 and WS. 1B4.4. The germ-line sequences of DSP2.7, DFL16.2 and the complementary strand (indicated by -c) of DSP2.3 and DSP2.6 are from Kabat et al. (1987). Boxes have been placed around nucleotides identical in sequence to known germline D sequences.

DSP2.6 (DSP2.6c- in Fig. 4), a g shared by the two D minigenes, then five nucleotides from DFL16.2. The 5'-eight and 3'-nine base flanking the fused D segment may result from N-segment addition by terminal transferase during V-D and RJ rearrangements. The D segment of V, 48.2.1 with nucleotides ggacgcaggtacgggct cannot be explained by any of the known BALB/c germline D minigenes and may originate from an undescribed germline D segment. The V, sequence of 61.1E9.9 belongs to Vlc-0x1 superfamily (Kaartinen ef al., 1988) and mouse kappa L chain subgroup VI based on amino acid sequence (Kabat and Wu, 1991). It is 95% identical in nucleotides to a member of the Vk--0x1 superfamily, V, 5G2, a monoclonal anti"phenyloxazolone (phOx) antibody originating from a C57BL/lO mouse (Fig. 3). There are eight amino acid differences between V, 61.1 E9.9 and V, 5G2 from codons 1 to 96, among them four in CDRI, one in CDR2 and two in FRI. They have an almost identical CDR3 with the exception of one amino acid (Leu + Pro) due to one nucleotide difference (t -+ c) at the junction of V,-J,. Both the VH and V, sequences of 61 .lE9.9 are 95% identical to that of a chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, 2H7, the differences are mainly in CDRs (the VL sequence of 2H7 is not shown). The H chains have identical CDRl, three amino acid differences in CDR2 and 12 in CDR3. There are four amino acid differences in CDRl of the L chains, two in CDR2 and one in CDR3. Of special interest is the finding that VL 61.1E9.9 has 90% nucleotide identity with an anti-a(1 --f 6)dextran monoclonal 10.16.1, the immunogen for anti-idiotype 6l.lE9.9 (the VL sequence of 10.16.1 is not shown). The V,+48.2.1 sequence is a member of VJC-21 group, as delineated by Potter et al. (1982), and has 95% identify in nucleotides to a germline gene of the Vlc-21B group (Heinrich et al., 1984) from codons 1 to 95. Six of seven amino acid differences between V, 48.2.1 and Vtc-213 are in or near CDRl; one is in CDR3. The amino acid sequence of Vrc 48.2.1 is identical to that of PC7043 throughout the V, domain including VL and Jtc,

an NZB myeloma protein of unknown specificity (Weigert et al., 1978). V, W5.1B4.4 (Fig. 3) derives from a member of Vk--0x1 family with 96.4% nucleotide identity to Vn-Oxl(H3) (Kaartinen et al., 1988). There are eight amino acid differences between them, half of these differences are in CDR3. There is 95.3% identity in amino acid sequence between the V, domains of W5.1B4.4 and 58.2C.10.3 (data not shown), an anti-or(1 -+ 6)dextran derived from a C57BL/6J mouse (Lai and Kabat, 1985; Akolkar ec al., 1987). Of five amino acid differences, two are in CDR3, two in FRl and one in FR3. All replacements are due to single nucleotide substitutions.

We report the complete nucleotide sequences of the VH and V, domains of four monoclonal anti-idiotypes to anti-a(1 -+6)dextrans. Since 61.1E9.9 and 61.10C2.8 may be clonally related, this represents three distinct anti-idiotypes. Anti-idiotypes V, 48.2.1 and V, 6l.lE9.9 belong to the QUPC52 and 5558 families, respectively, and have only 54% nucleotide and 39% amino acid homology. Although produced in response to the same Abl, a groove-type anti-a(1 + 6)dextran 10.16.1, they do not recognize the same determinant, as evidenced by their inability to inhibit one another's binding to 10.16.1 in competitive ELISA. Thus, 61.1E9.9 reacts with a determinant on 11 CI (I+ 6)dextran-specific antibodies, whereas 4X.2.1 recognizes a determinant expressed on only four of the 11 (Borden and Kabat, 1988). In contrast, anti-idiotype W5.lB4.4 defines an idiotype on the cavity-type anti-N(l + 6)dextran W3 129 which is not expressed on monoclonal groove-type antia( 1 + 6)dextrans tested and has a V, region from a germline gene of the 7183 family. In addition, a previous study (Perfetti et af., 1991) from this laboratory reported an isogeneic hybridoma anti-idiotype IdB5.7 (1gGl.K) raised to another groove-type ant&x( t -+ 6)dextran 45.21.1 which lacks the 61.1E9.9 idiotype. The VH

1126

JINGXIAN CHEN et al.

nucleotide sequence of IdB5.7 belongs to the Vu3609 family. In total, three syngeneic and one isogeneic monoclonal anti-idiotyp~s in the ~(1 -+ 6)dextran system have been described, all using V, genes from different families. Furthermore, no restriction is found among the V, of these four Ab2s. V, 61.1 E9.9 and V, WS. lB4.4 are derived from different members of the VK-0x1 superfamily; V, 482.1 derives from V,21-B, and VL IdB5.7 uses the V, 1 germline gene K.5.1. This is obviously different from some other studies. In a structural analysis of anti-idiotypes in the anti-NP system (Sablitzky and Rajewsky, 1984) it was found that the Vu genes expressed by some of the anti-idiotypes were highly homologous. A similar result was reported by Ollier et al. (1985) in the study of anti-idiotypes to the public idiotype on anti-GAT (a random copolymer of 60% glutamic acid, 30% alanine and 10% tyrosine) in which syngeneic anti-idiotypes from separate fusions fell into two groups serologically termed 20 and 22, respectively. Group 20 defined an idiotype common to GAT-specific Abls of several strains of mouse, and group 22 recognized a public idiotype present nearly exclusively on BALB/c anti-GAT antibodies. Two members of group 22 have highly homologous sequences in both the H chain (only one silent mutation in coding strand) and L chain (with a few nucleotides undete~ined). Three members of group 20 have 95-96% nucleotide identities in the H chain and 93-96% in the L chain (partial sequence). The Vi, of group 20 is about 94% homologous to group 22, but their V, domains differed extensively. In the antiazophenylarsonate (Ars) system, Meek et al. (19896) sequenced seven distinct syngeneic anti-idiotypic antibodies and allogeneic anti-idiotypic antibodies and found that three syngeneic Ab2s with different Ig isotypes (y I, y2a and y2b; Alkan, 1984) were identical in their Vu and V, regions except for a few substitutions, whereas the allogeneic Ab2 response was heterogeneous and derived from a number of unrelated germline elements. The three anti-idiotypes in this study differ in their isotype, 61.1E9.9 and W5.1B4.4 are IgG3 kappa, 48.2.1 is IgGl kappa. By immunochemical analysis, Borden and Kabat (1990) have shown not only that these anti-idiotypes recognize different idiotypic dete~i~ants, but also behave differently in forming precipitates with anti-cl( 1 -+ 6)dextrans. Specific precipitation was seen in saline when purified anti-a( 1 + 6)dextrans were added to ascitic fluid containing IgG3 anti-idiotype, whereas the IgGl anti-idiotype does not form precipitates with antia( 1 -+ 6)dextrans unless 3% PEG 6000 was added. Are the solubility properties of these three anti-idiotypes related to variable or constant region properties? It is not possible to determine this by examination of the variable region sequences, since the V-region sequences of precipitating and non"precipitating anti-idiotypes are very difIerent. Since cDNA clones have been made, the contribution of the heavy chain constant region could be evaluated by exchanging the constant regions of an IgGl and an IgG3 anti-idiotype by genetic engineering (Morrison et al., 1984) and testing whether the resulting

antibody had altered solubility when complexed with the idiotype. To answer questions regarding the structure of idiotype-anti-idiotype complexes, it would be of interest to examine precipitates by electron microscopy, as was done in the group A streptococcal carbohydrate system (Roux et al., 1987). The most homologous sequence to Vu 48.2.1 is a hybridoma protein from an NZB/NZW mouse with specificity to denatured DNA. Compared with VS2H9, Vu 482.1 has seven silent nucleotide substitutions in FRl, two in FR2 and two in FR3. In addition to two and four amino acid differences in CDRl and CDR2 in V, , respectively, CDR3 and J, of 48.2.1 and VD2H9 are very different. Considering that the light chain sequence of 48.2.1 is identical throughout the entire chain, including even the V-J joining point to that of PC7043, a myeloma with unknown specificity, one may expect that the H chain of 48.2.1 probably contributes more than the L chain to the combining site to the idiotype. V, W5.1B4.4 has a higher percentage of identity in nucleotide sequence to V, of anti-influenza virus hemagglutinin H230-7 (99%) than to that of germline sequence VH283 (95%) in the V, 7183 family. This suggests that both Vu W5.1B4.4 and Vu H230-7 may be encoded by a germline element other than VH283. Their D, N and J, differ, thus making CDR3 of V, of W5.1B4.4 and H230-7 very different, although they use the same V, gene with but three nucleotide differences. The major role of CDR3 in the combining specificity of Vu has been observed recently by several studies. Caton et al. (1990) reported that identical amino acid sequence in V, CDR3 was expressed by three mAbs to a human tumor-associated Ag GA733 derived in independent immunizations, either with Ag-positive tumor cell lines or with an Ab3; in contrast, their V, CDRl and V, CDR2 varied and their V, came from different families. Kabat and Wu (199 1) compared the frequencies of identical amino acid sequence in CDRs of Vu and V, chains of antibodies with different specificities on a statistical basis and found that V, CDR3 stood out as the least likely segment to associate with different antibodies of unrelated specificities. On the other hand, since these two antibodies have different K L chains (V, W5.1B4.4 and H230-7 V, are subgroups VI and I, respectively), the CDRl and CDRZ regions of V, W5.1B4.4 may be involved in the combining activity by joining with its ICchain counterpart to form a combining site different from that of H230-7. The V, of both the precipitating anti-idiotypes of WS.lB4.4 and 61.1E9.9 have 96 and 91% nucleotide identity, respectively, with germline VK-0x1; hence also with the VL of anti-a( 1 -+ 6)dextran 10.16.1 which is 99.6% identical in nucleotide to VK-0x1 (Akolkar et al., 1987). As a groove-type anti-oc(1 + 6)dextran and the immunogen for Ab2 61.1E9.9, 10.16.l(Abl) can bind ~(1 --t 6)dextrans and Ab2 very well (Borden and Kabat, 1988), whereas Ab2 which uses a similar V, gene as Abl can precipitate the Abl, 10.16.1, but not the Ag a(1 -+ 6)dextran at all. The same VK-0x1 gene, therefore, may combine with H chains from different V,

V-region sequences of three anti-idiotypes germlines to form antibodies with different specificities. A recent study from this laboratory (Wang et al., 1991) has shown that the Vrc-0x1 germline gene may pair with four different V, genes to form 25 groove-type anti-cc( 1 + 6)dextrans in different strains of mice. Thus the same VJC-0x1 gene may yield both Abl and Ab2 in the anti-cl( 1 + 6)dextran system. This is also consistent with a recent observation (Kabat and Wu, 1991) that six sets of identical V, were found in antibodies with different specificities. It has been reported (Akolkar et al,, 1987; Wang et al., 1990) that many antia( 1 -+ 6)dextrans use the Vrc-0x1 gene for their V, region, whether they have the 61.1E9.9 idiotope or not. Sikder et al. (1989) showed that the expression of the 61 .lE9.9 idiotype is mainly determined by the sequence of CDR2 of V,. Since V, and V, of the three Ab2s in this study are not closely enough related to any published V, and V, germline gene, one cannot really evaluate the role of somatic mutation in the generation of these antibodies. Since the first and second nucleotides in codon 96 of V, 6l.lE9.9 (Vlc-Jic2) are not derived from the J,2 BALB/c germline, they might have resulted from a somatic process. The D segments of 61.1E9.9 and W5.1B4.4 H chain share nucleotide sequence homology with two expressed D minigenes. In the murine system, 15 germline D minigenes have been reported and grouped into three families (DSP2, DFL16 and DQ52), clustered between V, and J,. Meek et al. (1989a) have provided evidence that D-D fusion is not limited to certain D segments, and D segments can be used in both orientations. Hence two D minigenes can be fused by direct or inverted rearrangement. The contribution of D-D rearrangements to antibody specificity deserves extensive further study. Mechanisms of D-D fusion have been discussed (Meek et al., 1989a; Perfetti et al., 1991) and fused D segments are fully able to complete subsequent D-J,, and V,-D rearrangements. The resultant Vn-D-D-J, molecules, therefore, increase recombinational diversity. Several instances of D-D fusion in primary antibodies have been observed in the murine system (Legrain et al., 1985; Shlomchick et al., 1987; Shlomchick et al., 1990; Liu Z. Q. et al., 1987) and recently in the human (Davidson et al., 1990), but D-D fusion seems to occur more frequently in anti-idiotypic antibodies. Ollier et al. (1985) first reported two out of eight monoclonal Ab2s in the anti-GAT system may be encoded by fused D segments. Meek et al. (1989b) found that out of 29 monoclonal anti-idiotypes from different antigen systems, seven have unusual D segments that could be explained by D-D fusion. Raychaudhuri et al. (1990) reported another six anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibodies with D-D fusion in their V, CDR3. A human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody which arose naturally in an individual during the course of a routine rabies virus immunization protocol was encoded by a recombinant V, gene in which D-D fusion can be found (van der Heijden et al., 1980). Three of four anti-idiotypes in the anti-tx(1 + 6)dextran system appear to have
D-D

1127

segments (this study; Perfetti et al., 1991), whereas only two of 43 anti-cr( 1 + 6)dextran (Abls) sequenced in our laboratory showed D-D fusion. D-D fusion might be a common structural feature of Ab2s as proposed by Meek et al. (1989b) raising the question as to the contribution of D-D fusion in the generation of antibody diversity and its relation to anti-idiotypic specificity.
