The Structure of Interleukin-2 Complexed with Its Alpha Receptor
Mathias Rickert,* Xinquan Wang,* Martin J. Boulanger, Natalia Goriatcheva, K. Christopher Garcia.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that binds sequentially to the alpha (IL-2Ra), beta (IL-2Rb), and common gamma chain (gc) receptor subunits. Here we present the 2.8 angstrom crystal structure of a complex between human IL-2 and IL-2Ra, which interact in a docking mode distinct from that of other cytokine receptor complexes. IL-2Ra is composed of strandswapped ``sushi-like'' domains, unlike the classical cytokine receptor fold. As a result of this domain swap, IL-2Ra uses a composite surface to dock into a groove on IL-2 that also serves as a binding site for antagonist drugs. With this complex, we now have representative structures for each class of hematopoietic cytokine receptor­docking modules. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which is one of the first cytokines identified and a member of the four-helix bundle cytokine superfamily, acts at the heart of the immune response (1). IL-2 and its alpha receptor, IL-2Ra, are expressed by T cells after the activation of T cell receptors by peptide­major histocompatibility complexes. The subsequent autocrine interaction of IL-2 with its receptors leads to the stimulation of signal transduction pathways resulting in T cell, B cell, and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation and clonal expansion (2). The pleiotropic biological activities of IL-2 are mediated by three cell surface receptors: the IL-2Ra chain; the IL-2Rb chain; and the common gamma chain (gc), which is also a receptor for IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 (3). These cell surface receptors form a complex that signals through the intracellular activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase 3 (Jak3) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) (4). The IL-2Ra chain, originally identified as the Tac antigen (CD25) (5­7), is enigmatic in that it lacks

signature features of the cytokine receptor superfamily (8). IL-2Rb (p75) and the gc are both members of the hematopoietic growth factor receptor family, containing the signature cytokine-binding homology region (CHR), which is composed of two fibronectin type-III (FN-III) repeats (2, 8). Biochemical studies show that the assembly of the IL-2 receptor complex is initiated by the interaction of IL-2 with IL-2Ra, followed by sequential recruitment of IL-2Rb and gc (9, 10). IL-2Ra alone is the Blowaffinity[ receptor (dissociation constant Kd È 10 nM). When expressed together, IL-2Ra and IL-2Rb form the pseudo­high-affinity receptor (Kd È 30 pM). Finally, the IL-2Rabgc complex forms the high-affinity receptor (Kd È 10 pM) that is the signaling complex found on activated T cells (2). The IL-2Rb and gc binding sites on IL-2 have been mapped to locations analogous to the site I and site II cytokine-binding sites originally established in the human growth hormone (hGH) system (11). However, based on sequence analysis and mutagenesis studies, IL-2Ra is predicted to differ from other cytokine receptors in both its structure and its mode of interaction with IL-2 (12). IL-2Ra is a target for therapeutic modulation because it is not expressed on resting T and B cells but is continuously expressed by the abnormal T cells of patients with forms of SCIENCE VOL 308

leukemia, autoimmunity, and organ transplant rejection (13, 14). An antagonistic monoclonal antibody to IL-2Ra (anti-Tac) (Daclizumab) is effective in preventing the rejection of organ transplants (15). Small-molecule inhibitors of IL-2Ra have also been developed (16, 17). IL-2 (Proleukin) itself is used to augment immune system function and has efficacy in treating metastatic renal carcinoma and melanoma (18). However, there is severe doselimiting toxicity that is largely attributed to activation of the bgc form of the receptor on NK cells (18). Currently, no structural information exists for any of the IL-2 receptors, and this information could assist in the design of improved therapeutics. Here we present a crystal structure at 2.8 ) resolution of human IL-2 in complex with the extracellular domain of IL-2Ra (19). In the complex structure, the IL-2Ra ectodomain resembles an arm bent È90- at the elbow between the N- and C-terminal domains (D1 and D2, respectively), engaging IL-2 along the length of the underside of D1 (Fig. 1, A and B). The IL-2 binding surface comprises helix A¶, helix B¶, and part of the AB loop. The long axes of the IL-2Ra b sheets are aligned parallel with the helical axes of the cytokine. This differs from the typical cytokine receptor interaction. For example, in the complex of hGH with its receptor (hGH-R), the CHR module of hGH-R, composed of two b-sandwich FN-III domains, forms a considerably larger, but similar, bent arm­like structure (Fig. 1B) (20). However, the protruding elbow region of hGH-R exposes loops that bind to the sides of the hGH four-helix bundle (20) (Fig. 1B). Although substantially different, the closest similarity can be found in the recently elucidated site III contact between gp130-class cytokines and the gp130 D1 domain (21). However, in that interaction, the cytokine forms contacts exclusively through loops at the tip of the cytokine, rather than with residues on the helical surfaces. In the IL-2Ra structure, the core D1 and D2 domains are separated by a 42-residue interdomain linker peptide (Thr65 to His103), and the second domain has an additional C-terminal 54-residue connecting peptide leading to the cell membrane (Gly165 to Glu217). Neither of these linkers is visible in the electron density

map, and they are therefore not included in the IL-2Ra model (Fig. 1A). These linker segments do not contribute to ligand binding. Thus, 120 residues (D1 and D2 domains) of the 217­amino acid extracellular domain are structured. It is possible that this extensive amount of flexible polypeptide contributed to the difficulties in obtaining crystals suitable for a structure determination, as crystallization of the complex was originally reported in 1989 (22). IL-2Ra deviates from the classical cytokine receptor fold, both in the structures of the individual domains and in the interdomain folding topology (Fig. 1A). Each of the two IL-2Ra domains exhibits È30% amino acid homology to a group of b-sandwich protein domains variously called sushi domains, short consensus repeats (SCRs), or complement control protein (CCP) repeats (23) (Fig. 2B). Canonical sushi domains (È65 amino acids in a 2-on-3 sandwich) can be considered Bmini[ FN-III­type domains (È110 residues in a 3-on-4 sandwich). Like sushi domains, IL-2Ra D1 (residues 1 to 64) and D2 (residues 104 to 165) show an elliptical b-sandwich structure, containing several residues that are highly conserved in sushi domains of several complementary related proteins (Cys3/30/46/61, Pro7, Tyr20, Gly33, Phe34, and Trp55) (24). However, both IL-2Ra domains deviate substantially from canonical sushi topology; they are 1-on-4, instead of 2-on-3, b sandwiches. The folding topology of IL-2Ra also exhibits swapping of b strands across the N- and C-terminal sushi-like domains (Fig. 2A). Strands A and B exchange with strands F and G, respectively, to give the folding topology F-on-G-C-D-E for D1 and A-on-B-H-I-J for D2. Interdomain disulfide bonds between Cys3 and Cys46 of D1 and Cys147 and Cys104 of D2 enforce the strand exchange by pinning strand A of D1 to strand I of D2 and strand G of D2 to strand D in D1 (Figs. 1A and 2A). This strand exchange has not been seen among bjsandwich­type structures (Fig. 2B), or in classical FN-III­ type cytokine receptors. The IL-15 a receptor is a single sushi domain, so there is not the possibility for a strand exchange in that case. Despite the unstructured 42­amino acid linker peptide in IL-2Ra, the D1 and D2 domains are in intimate contact with one another through an extensive interdomain interface. A large hydrophobic core is formed between the swapped top strands in each domain, which likely imparts rigidity to the overall structure (Fig. 1A). These exposed aromatics on the surface of the top strands of the b sandwich would serve as the inner hydrophobic core between the top and bottom sheets of a canonical sushi domain, if the strands in IL-2Ra were not domain-swapped. The IL-2 molecule has the common cytokine fold (8), with the typical up-up-downdown four-helix topology. The four-helix bundle structure of the IL-2 molecule in the IL-2/IL-2Ra complex closely superimposes with the free IL-2 molecule E0.74 ) root mean square deviation (RMSD) on 76 Ca positions^, but with minor structural adapta-

tions in the receptor binding site (25, 26). The IL-2 CD loop, which is usually disordered in uncomplexed IL-2 structures, is completely ordered in the receptor-bound IL-2 structure because residues Glu106 to Asp109 are involved in binding to IL-2Ra. The first and last turn of helix A¶ as well as the last turn of helix B¶ are partially unwound as compared with free IL-2 (fig. S1). The interaction between IL-2 and IL-2Ra occurs between the four-stranded b sheet, strands G-C-D-E, and the IL-2 A¶ and B¶ helices (Fig. 3A). As a result of complex formation, 20 IL-2 residues and 21 IL-2Ra residues bury a total of 1868 ) (fig. S2 and table S2). Two prominent hydrophobic patches on IL-2 are consistent with thermodynamic measurements indicating that the desolvation of apolar surface is the primary energetic driving force of this interaction (red amino acids in Fig. 3B and red patches in Fig. 4A). The first patch is composed of Tyr 45 on the AB loop of IL-2, which packs into a pocket formed by the methylene groups of Arg35 and Arg36 of the IL-2Ra C¶ strand. This hydrophobic cluster is surrounded by polar interactions. Mutations of IL-2Ra Arg35 and Arg36 disrupt interaction with IL-2 (27). The most conspicuous and centrally located hydrophobic cluster is composed of Phe42 and Leu72 on the IL-2 AB loop and helix B¶, respectively, inserting into a recessed pocket on IL-2Ra composed of Leu42 to Tyr 43, and Met 25 (fig. S4 and Figs. 3B and 4A). Several salt bridges and hydrogen bonds surround this hydrophobic patch (Fig. 3A and table S2). Mutational studies identify this second hydrophobic region around IL-2 Phe42 as the primary energetic determinant in the IL-2­ binding epitope (27, 28). T cells can express IL-2 splice variants, which are natural inhibitors of IL-2 signaling through the highaffinity abgc receptor (29). The splice variants lack either exon 2 (IL-2d2), which encodes Asn30 to Lys49, or exon 3 (IL-2d3), which encodes Ala50 to Lys97. Because these regions are involved in the interaction between IL-2Ra and full-length IL-2, the splice variants would almost certainly not bind IL-2Ra. Thus, the mechanism of inhibition appears to be the occupation of the IL-2Rb and gc receptors, preventing recruitment of IL-2Ra by wildtype IL-2 and inhibiting signaling on activated T cells through the abgc complex. The disruption of protein-protein interactions with small molecules has proven to be an exceedingly difficult goal for the pharmaceutical industry in comparison to the inhibition of enzyme active sites. However, potent small-molecule inhibitors of the IL-2/ IL-2Ra interaction have been developed (17). One of these small molecules, compound 1 (16), fits into a groove between the IL-2 AB loop and helix B¶, wrapping around IL-2 Phe42 as a hydrophobic anchor residue (Fig. 4B) (17). In binding to IL-2, the small molecule induces the rearrangement of residues Lys35, Arg38, Met39, and Phe42, compared with several unliganded IL-2 structures (17). In particular, a large change in conformation of the IL-2 Phe42 aromatic ring creates the recessed channel used for binding the drug (Fig. 4B). This conformational adjustment does not occur upon receptor binding; in contrast, Phe42 is a prominent knob fitting into a pocket on IL-2Ra. Superposition of the drug/IL-2 complex on the IL-2/

IL-2Ra complex reveals that although a substantial portion of the drug fits within open space in the interface, there are steric clashes with the IL-2 Phe42 binding pocket. The drug apparently uses highly favorable enthalpic interactions to compensate for the entropic penalty of binding (17) and to overcome its small buried surface area. In contrast, binding of IL-2Ra to IL-2 is entropically favorable. Hence, even though the drug and receptor target a similar hydrophobic hot spot, they use opposite thermodynamic solutions for binding. Previously determined binding modes between hematopoietic cytokines and their receptors involve combinations of the classical site I/II and the recently determined site III mode for gp130 cytokines (21). We suggest that the distinctive docking geometry of the IL-2/IL-2Ra interaction is a fourth binding mode and now gives us representative examples of all binary recognition modules used by hematopoietic receptors to recognize four-helix cytokines. These four modules can be used as building blocks, in different combinations, to construct topological models for complexes between all known cytokines and their receptors. As discussed, IL-2 also binds to two additional receptor subunits, the IL-2Rb and gc chains, to form a quaternary signaling complex. Functional studies and molecular modeling placed the binding epitopes of IL-2Rb and gc on the faces of adjacent helices A (IL-2 Asp 20) and D (IL-2 Gln126), respectively (11, 14, 30) (figs. S1 and S5). It has been postulated that IL-2Rb will bind in site I­type and gc will bind in site II­type geometries (Fig. 1B, hGH complex). The binding site of IL-2Ra is ideal for an initial engagement of cytokine, leaving sides of the helical faces open for engagement of the IL-2Rb and gc components. By initially capturing IL-2 on the cell surface, the IL-2Ra would reduce the entropic cost for the subsequent recruitment of additional receptors (31).

A Fluoroquinolone Resistance Protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis That Mimics DNA
Subray S. Hegde,1* Matthew W. Vetting,1* Steven L. Roderick,1 Lesley A. Mitchenall,2 Anthony Maxwell,2 Howard E. Takiff,3 John S. Blanchard1.
Fluoroquinolones are gaining increasing importance in the treatment of tuberculosis. The expression of MfpA, a member of the pentapeptide repeat family of proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causes resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. This protein binds to DNA gyrase and inhibits its activity. Its three-dimensional structure reveals a fold, which we have named the right-handed quadrilateral b helix, that exhibits size, shape, and electrostatic similarity to B-form DNA. This represents a form of DNA mimicry and explains both its inhibitory effect on DNA gyrase and fluoroquinolone resistance resulting from the protein's expression in vivo. Increasing resistance to two bactericidal compounds that act on rapidly growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, isoniazid and rifampicin, is driving the search for new therapies. Fluoroquinolones exert their powerful antibacterial activity by interacting with DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV (1). They bind reversibly to the enzyme-DNA complex and stabilize the covalent enzyme tyrosylDNA phosphate ester, which is normally a transient intermediate in the topoisomerase reaction. Hydrolysis of this linkage leads to the accumulation of double-stranded DNA fragments and is the bactericidal consequence of fluoroquinolone treatment. Newer fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, SCIENCE

exhibit powerful in vitro activity against mycobacteria (2, 3), and they can reduce multidrug treatment regimens from 6 to 4 months when substituted for isoniazid (4). Resistance to fluoroquinolones remains rare in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis (5), but it has been increasing as their use in the treatment of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis infections increases (6). High-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in laboratory strains of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis (7, 8) is known to result from amino acid substitutions in the putative fluoroquinolone binding region of the M. tuberculosis gyrA-encoded A subunit of DNA gyrase (7, 8). This is the only type II topoisomerase encoded in the M. tuberculosis genome (9) and thus is the unique target for fluoroquinolones in this organism (10, 11).
