SUMMARY
Biotechnology provides tools for therapeutic exploitation following advances in the elucidation of protein-to-cell and cell-to-cell interactions. Molecular targeting of bacterial and plant toxins to the desired district of action can be achieved through effector molecules like monoclonal antibodies or protein ligands. Biochemical conjugation of these effectors to SO-6, a single-chain Ribosome Inactivating Protein from Saponaria officinalis, yielded powerful cytotoxic agents that are attractive candidates for therapeutic evaluation. Cloning of the gene for this plant toxin has been achieved. Technologies for expression of protein ligands, such as apolipoproteins or several growth factors, are available in recombinant microorganisms, providing adequate partners for the assembly of targeted chimaeras. Domain engineering of structural and functional regions in effector proteins is now possible and will be carried out with the available technologies to improve existing therapy.
KEy WORDS:

INTRODUCTION
In previous articles, I have been referring to affinity therapy as the opportunity to attempt precise targeting of therapeutic effectors to their district of action [1, 2]. Within the past years, advances in biochemistry and molecular biology of membranes and cell growth regulation have provided tools that can assist in the design of more selective chemotherapeutic agents. A major challenge of modern therapeutics is to selectively destroy a population of cancerous cells while leaving normal cells unaffected. Direct cytotoxicity with "armed" antibodies chemically conjugated to drugs or toxins stems from ideas put forward at least since Paul Ehrlich discussed them almost 100 years ago [3]. Immunoconjugates between monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic drugs (e.g., anthracyclines) have been reported to result in some reduction of tumor size in animal models [4]. However, highly potent immunoconjugates have now been obtained with ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs). The RIPs used ranged from ricin A chain (from the highly toxic plant protein ricin) to the much less toxic RIPs gelonin or pokeweed antiviral protein (reviewed by Frankel (5».

Originally, immunotoxins were synthesized using the purified A chains of ricin or diphtheria toxin; however, these types of immunotoxins have potential problems for clinical use. A large proportion of the population is immunized against the inactivated diphtheria toxin. In the case of ricin A chain, it is very difficult to purify the A chain completely from the B chain due to the strong hydrophobic bonding between the two chains [6]. The instability or ricin A chain makes it difficult to handle the isolated subunit, with residual cytotoxicity resulting from potentially contaminating B chain as an additional problem. Single-chain RIPs, lacking the equivalent of a cell-binding B chain, have also been described (reviewed by Stirpe and Barbieri [7]). Without the ability to bind cells, they are much less toxic. One type of these single-chain RIPs, SO-6, is the major protein species of a family of proteins present in the seeds and leaves of the common Cariophyllacea plant Saponaria officinalis (soapwort). SO-6 is very stable, does not contain carbohydrates, resists to denaturing agents like SDS or to treatment with many proteases [8] (G.P. Nitti, unpublished observations), and has a remarkably high isoelectric point (> 10; [9]). The various RIPs from S. officinalis are highly related structurally [10, 11], crossreact with antisera raised against SO-6 [12] and show similar N-terminal amino acid sequences to the RIPs from Phytolacca americana [13].

SO-6 CONJUGATES
Biochemical conjugates have been obtained between SO-6 and purified human diferric transferrin. Human erythroleukaemic K562 cells were strongly inhibited in their proliferation after internalization of a conjugate that had variable numbers of SO-6 molecules disulfide-linked to a single transferrin molecule [14]. Colony formation by these cells was also markedly inhibited in clonogenic assays, while not influenced by free SO-6 or transferrin. Similar results were obtained linking Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) to murine monoclonal antibodies recognizing the human transferrin receptor, as reviewed recently by Pastan's group [15]. The powerful activity of transferrin-based conjugates in nude mouse models of human ovarian cancer makes these conjugates attractive candidates for clinical evaluation, e.g. for intraperitoneal therapy of metastatic dissemination. Other intracavitarian applications (e.g., intrathecal) might also be envisaged. An anti-human immunoglobulin heavy chain monoclonal antibody was conjugated to SO-6 and evaluated on Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Bjab 113. The immunotoxin was capable of killing 99.9070 of clonogenic lymphoma cells after a 2 hour incubation [16], making it a potentially useful tool for eliminating lymphoma and leukemia cells from human bone marrow during ex vivo treatment prior to reimplantation. The presence of bone marrow buffy coat containing mature granulocytes and red blood cells inhibited the activity of the conjugate. However, full potency was restored by adding a potentiator, amantadine, to the incubation medium, by analogy to previous improvement of cytotoxin efficacy obtained with ricin A chain [17]. Potency also in the absence of potentiators was demonstrated in various conjugates between SO-6 and a panel of anti-T lymphocyte monoclonal

antibodies. In a series of papers by the group of A.M. Gianni at the National Cancer Institute in Milan, anti-T cell immunitoxins showed great promise for ex vivo purging of human bone marrow prior to transplantation, and as systemic therapeutic agents in patients with graft-versus-host disease, T-cell and B-cell leukemia. Anti-CD5 T-cell surface antigen monoclonal antibodies directed SO-6 to kill target T lymphocytes from whole peripheral blood after very short exposures to the immunotoxin (10 minutes), and at physiologic pH [18J. These three functional characteristics of anti CD5-S06 conjugates, i.e. activity in physiologic culture conditions without potentiators, rapidity of action, and lack of inhibition by whole blood components, are in marked contrast to the requirements of other immunotoxins obtained by coupling ricin A chain to similar monoclonal antibodies [19J. In addition, the RIP's resistance to proteases, its high isoelectric point and lack of carbohydrates presumably confer remarkable stability to anti CD5-S06 immunotoxins. Therefore, the authors evaluated the fate of the same anti CD5-S06 conjugate described above in cynomolgus monkeys by 1) following the clearance from blood of intact immunotoxin by immunoenzymatic assay, and 2) determining the ability of the conjugate, retrieved from the circulation after up to 48 hours, to inhibit DNA synthesis of human T cells. The half-life of this anti CD5-S06 immunotoxin into the circulation was shown by Siena et al. [18J to be considerably longer than those previously reported for various ricin A chain immunotoxins in various primate or rodent models. Anti CD5-S06 was also capable of eliminating more than 950/0 of clonable graft-infiltrating T lymphocytes in an irreversibly rejected kidney allograft from a patient that had resisted all previous aggressive immunosuppression [20J. Thus, immunotoxins might be used to treat not only graft-versus-host but also host-versus-graft reaction, i.e, acute graft rejection, through suppression of clonogenic growth of renal allograft-infiltrating T lymphocytes. The CD5 epitope is displayed not only by T lymphocytes, but also by B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. The availability of a method for inducing the proliferation of quiescent B-CLL cells [21J allowed Siena et al. [22J to devise a preclinical assay aimed at evaluating the effect of an anti CD5-S06 immunotoxin on fresh leukemic cells from patients. Out of 31 patients evaluated, the cells from 28 patients proliferated in response to the in vitro stimulation by an insolubilized anti-C3b receptor antibody and B-cell growth factor. Cells from 26 out of 28 "responders" were highly sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of anti CD5-S06. The immunotoxin was again as effective on isolated as on whole blood B-CLL cells in a dose-related manner in the absence of potentiators. The authors conclude that further phase I-II clinical trials of anti CD5-S06 should be initiated to evaluate treatment on B-CLL patients responding to the in vitro B-CLL proliferation assay. Similar conclusions were obtained with anti CDI9and anti CD22-S06 immunotoxins by Bregni et al, [23J, who investigated the effects of these conjugates also on B-Iymphoma cell lines besides on fresh B-CLL cells. In vitro cytotoxicity profiles similar to those of anti CD5 conjugates described above were also obtained with anti CD3-S06 conjugates [24J. In contrast, anti CD2-S06 showed only moderate citotoxicity, a situation already observed with similar anti CD2 monoclonal antibodies conjugated to another RIP, gelonin [25,

26]. This is consistent with the different role of the CD2 antigen (the E-rosette receptor), presumably involved in T-lineage cell-to-cell interactions through an extracellular domain involved in cellular adhesion [27]. The feasibility of in vivo treatment with SO-6 immunotoxins administered systemically was substantiated by results obtained in mice receiving an anti-Thy 1 monoclonal antibody. This monoclonal was raised in rats and disulfide-linked to SO-6. Both the proliferative response as well as Thy 1 antigen expression of treated mouse lymphocytes were evaluated [28]. Toxicity studies showed that a single intravenous injection of doses up to 20 /Lg of immunotoxin per mouse was well tolerated and allowed indefinite survival. The concanavalin A-induced proliferative response of spleen cells from mice sacrificed 1 day after treatment with sublethal doses of the conjugate was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition observed at doses of ~ 5 /Lg immunotoxin per mouse. In limiting dilution cultures of spleen cells from mice treated with 5 /Lg of immunotoxin 1 or 4 days before sacrifice, a 9711/0 depletion of T-lymphocytes capable of proliferation was observed. Limiting dilution cultures showed that also the thymus of IT-treated mice was depleted by more than 9011/0 of growth-competent T lymphocytes.

CLONING OF THE GENE FOR 80-6
Cloning and expressing a plant toxin gene in microorganisms is advantageous because contaminating toxic components (as is the case with ricin and abrin) can be totally eliminated by this approach. Moreover, chemical conjugation between the monoclonal antibody or ligand and the toxic moiety might result in unpredictable loss of activity of both components, and removal of unreacted toxin or ligand from the chemical conjugate is also not a trivial matter. Instead, the assembly of chimaeric toxins by gene fusion techniques should yield a precise peptidic linkage between the toxic moiety and the ligand. Finally, components of the conjugate and the conjugate itself can be obtained by cost-effective fermentation of recombinant microorganisms. The gene coding for SO-6 was recently cloned in our laboratory [29]. A cDNA library from the leaves of S. officinalis was screened with synthetic oligonucleotide probes representing various portions of the corresponding amino acid sequences of the protein. The translated sequence of the cDNA clones thus identified showed the signal peptide and the coding region for SO-6, with a region of high similarity to other RIPs where critical amino acid residues might participate in the active site [30, 31]. The complete amino acid sequence of SO-6 from the seeds of S. officinalis has also been determined by automated gasphase sequenator techniques [G.P. Nitti et al., in preparation] and shows few differences with the sequence predicted by the leaf cDNA. These differences might be due to heterogeneity between plant varieties, or to different forms of such RIPs in the same plant as in the case of pokeweed antiviral protein, PAP [32] and of ricin [33]. Preliminary attempts at expressing recombinant SO-6 in E. coli have been performed by fusing the coding region of the gene to that of beta-galactosidase

(provided by plasmid pUEX 3; [34]). The resulting chimeric protein of the expected molecular weight is recognized by immunoblot analysis with a polyclonal anti-S06 antibody (35].

RECOMBINANT CHIMERIC TOXINS
There are now several examples where recombinant DNA methodologies have been employed to construct fused genes between cloned toxins and ligands. The first example of such construction was provided by Murphy et aI. [36] who fused the gene coding for a truncated diphtheria toxin fragment to that coding for melanocyte - stimulating hormone (alpha - MSH). The toxin-hormone chimeric gene directed the expression of a fused protein that retained the ADPribosyltransferase activity and the lipid-associating domains of diphtheria toxin; however, the diphtheria toxin receptor-binding domain was replaced with MSH sequences. The chimeric toxin was found to be toxic for MSH receptor-positive human malignant melanoma cells in culture, while not being toxic for either chinese hamster ovary or african green monkey kidney cells, both of which lack the alpha-MSH receptor . More recently, these earlier observations were extended by targeting the cloned toxin genes as fused products with lymphokine-coding genes (notably IL-2 and, more recently, IL-6) and other growth factors like Transforming Growth Factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Fusion of the gene encoding IL-2 to a truncated diphtheria toxin gene resulted in the expression of a biologically active chimeric IL-2 toxin. The fused protein was shown to be selectively targeted to activated or to malignant T cells carrying specific surface receptors for the ligand components of the hybrid, and was internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis following in vitro binding to the IL-2 receptor (37] . The chimeric IL2-toxin was also examined on delayed-type hypersensitivity (an in-vivo T cell-mediated response) and found to be a potent immunosuppressive agent. Receptor-positive T cells were selectively eliminated in draining lymph nodes, even in those mice possessing high titres of antibodies to diphtheria toxin [38]. Similar results were obtained in vitro, using a chimeric IL-2 fused to a cloned, modified Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE40) lacking the sequence encoding the cell recognition domain [39], and in vivo on rejection of mouse cardiac allografts [40] using the chimeric protein purified to homogeneity by the use of IL-2 receptor-affinity chromatography [41]. A chimeric IL6-PE40 was recently obtainded by Siegall et al. [42] and shown to be selectively toxic for U266 human myeloma cells. Besides myeloma and other types of tumors expressing high levels of IL-6 receptors, this conjugate should be useful to treat rheumato id arthritis, where high expression of IL-6 has been observed in synovial fluid of these patients [43]. The gene coding for transforming growth factor type alpha (TGF-alpha) was fused to the gene coding for PE40 and the chimeric gene was expressed in E. coli. The highly purified chimeric protein was shown to kill cells (A431 and KB) which have high numbers of surface receptors for Epidernal Growth Factor (EGF), a closely related autocrine ligand [44], and might be useful in treating tumors like carcinomas or neuroglioblastomas that bear unusually large numbers of EGF receptors.

CD4 is a surface receptor on T-lymphocytes which has been shown to serve as receptor for the AIDS virus, HIV [45]. The cloned HIV-binding portion of the human CD4 molecule, linked to cloned PE40 and expressed in E. coli was shown to bind to the viral protein gp120 both in solution and on the cell surface. Following internalization and translocation to the cytoplasm, cells expressing the HIV envelope were selectively killed by this chimeric protein [46].

DOMAIN ENGINEERING
Many large eukaryotic proteins have been shown to consist of characteristic domain structures, often reflected in the genome by the arrangement of the exons and introns making up the gene. Cloned genes for a wide variety of proteins of therapeutic interest have now been expressed in different microorganisms or mammalian and even insect cells, including hormones, blood proteins, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors and antibodies. The role of protein domains in evolution rests on the theory of "exon shuffling", in which exons are described as units in the evolutionary rearrangements of genes. It follows that protein domains, or at least coherent structural motifs, could be transferred between unrelated genes to obtain, at least in theory, new proteins out of "old" domains. In a now classical review, L. Patthy [47] pointed out the evolutionary aspects of this modular assembly. Related domains of several proteins involved in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and other still unknown functions possess homologous units that may result from exon shuffling. The mosaic character of many proteins presenting independently folding domains has now been confirmed in several protein families, thus revealing fascinating insights in evolutionary cutand-pasting. Examples of these are to be found in the coagulation pathway, with the "kringle" domains found in plasminogen, prothrombin, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) , pro-urokinase (single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator, scU-PA) and apoliporprotein(a) [48, 49]. tPA and scU-PA are very similar in their COOH-terminal domains, where the catalytic activity of both enzymes is located. Fibrin binding has been found to reside in the NH2-terminal part of tPA, with four domains involved. Of these, one is the "finger" region, homologous to the tandemly repeated "fingers" of fibronectin that are crucial for the fibrin affinity of fibronectin. The two kringle domains are also involved in fibrin binding, as shown by deletion mapping experiments supporting the idea that individual domains of tPA fold autonomously and carry autonomous functions [50]. The similar kringle domain in scU-PA is not involved in fibrin binding; however, the NH2-terminal domain of scU-PA interacts with a specific receptor on normal and neoplastic cells [51]. Cytolytic proteins of the complement cascade and the killer lymphocyte protein perforin have also been shown to result from modular assembly of independent domains [52]. Cloning and sequencing of perforin has revealed that this protein and proteins C7, C8 and C9 of complement all share a small central core of homology that accounts for properties of membrane interaction and pore formation on the surface of target cells: an amphipathic structure involved in lipid binding, and a cysteine-rich region homologous to the above mentioned

Pharmacological Research, Vol. 21, Supplement 2,1989

region of prourokinase interacting with its receptor. Other domains of these proteins are those homologous to the LDL receptor apolipoprotein-binding domain, those homologous to the platelet adhesive protein thrombospondin, and those homologous to the lipid-linked membrane binding domain of Decay Accelerating Factor, a complement regulatory protein [53]. Apolipoproteins present in HDL and LDL are good examples of proteins possessing desirable functions both as ligands for specific receptors [54] and as lipid-binding proteins through their amphipathic helical structures. For instance, liposomes containing LDL were shown to be targeted, via the LDL receptor, to leukemic lymphocytes in vitro to deliver hygromycin B into the cytoplasm [55]. Several studies indicate that exogenous administration of HDL-like apolipoproteins might result in postitive effects on various experimental models of atherosclerosis [56, 57]. However, the difficulty to obtain pure apo AI from human plasma in sufficient amounts has severely limited the exploration of possible benefits deriving by the administration of this protein for therapeutic purposes, either alone or combined with different lipids. Therefore, production of apo AI and of its variant forms by recombinant DNA techniques would be very useful to further pursue this approach. Expression of the protein in prokaryotes like E. coli would allow large scale production at lower cost. Production of naturally occurring molecular variants such as the 'AI-Milano' variant [58, 59], or of newly engineered variant proteins or "muteins", could also be easily achieved by such systems. Many problems were encountered when attempting to express apo AI in E. coli. One problem was the susceptibility of recombinant apo AI to intracellular degradation during bacterial growth, with a half-life of < 10 min. as determined by pulse-chase experiments [60, 61]. Thus, expression of apo AI in E. coli was achieved by stabilizing the gene product resorting to gene fusions. Initially, the apo AI gene was fused to the 3' end of the gene coding for E. coli beta-galactosidase [62]. This procedure successfully prolonged the intracellular half-life of the apo AI fusion product inside E. coli. However, degradation of the apo AI moiety still occurred in the fused protein, with an approximate half-life of about 45 min. [63]. Other reasons for poor expression of apo AI in E. coli were further investigated by inserting, this time at the 5' end of the beta-galactosidase gene, fragments derived from the 5' end of the gene coding for apo AI. This procedure resulted in poor efficiency of initiation of mRNA translation, and low expression levels of the resulting protein. With the help of synthetic oligonucleotides, several random mutants were generated in this region, the region coding for the NH2-terminal sequence of apo AI, without altering the resulting aminoacid sequence because of the degeneracy of the genetic code. Some mutations led to high levels of expression, underlying the importance of secondary structures at the 5' end of apo AI mRNA, which influence the efficiency of translational initiation [64]. As a result, conditions for efficient production of apo AI in E. coli were identified [65]. The apo AI gene was modified by site directed mutagenesis techniques to obtain the "Milano" variant and other "muteins". All were efficiently expressed in E. coli, and the corresponding proteins could be detected by immunoassay with anti-human apo AI

antiserum [66]. A similar strategy was employed to achieve high level expression of the angiogenic growth factor FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) [67] and its molecular variants in E. coli [68, 69].

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Molecular stategies for recombinant drug delivery will increasingly put to use the accumulated knowledge about the structural and functional aspects of interacting molecules. Explosive growth is now taking place in the characterization of protein domains and signals involved in the molecular aspects of cellular adhesion mechanisms, of intracellular membrane traffic and topogenic signals, of cell surface receptors and their ligands, of autoendocrine/paracrine growth factors. For instance, following the identification of a nonapeptide from the B1 chain sequence of laminin as a major site for cell binding [70], a synthetic pentapeptide within that sequence was found to reduce the formation of lung colonies in mice injected with melanoma cells [71]. This is a remarkable example of how the knowledge gained from these studies could be immediately put to work to interfere specifically with these structures for antineoplastic therapy. These new tools will allow molecular biologists to focus on mechanisms that could be exploited for selective delivery of substances possessing biological and/or pharmacological activity, and molecular pharmacologists to deliver therapeutic agents in innovative ways.
