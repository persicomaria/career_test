Abstract We structurally characterized the adducts of the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) with three different nonpeptidic inhibitors by solving the solution structure of one adduct [MMP3­N-isobutyl-N-(4methoxyphenylsulfonyl)glycyl hydroxamic acid] and then by calculating structural models of the other two adducts using a reduced set of experimental NMR data, following a recently proposed procedure (Bertini et al. in J. Med. Chem. 48:7544­7559, 2005). The inhibitors were selected with the criteria of maintaining in all of them the same

zinc-coordinating moiety and of selectively changing the substituents and/or the functional groups. The backbone dynamics on various time scales have been characterized as well. The comparison among these structures and with others previously reported allowed us to elucidate fine details of inhibitor­receptor interactions and to develop some criteria, which could guide in optimizing the design of selective inhibitors.

Introduction Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases which participate in the degradation and remodelling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and of the connective tissues [1­3]. These processes are essential for physiological activities, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and foetal development [4]. To date, at least 24 human MMPs have been identified and they can be grouped into five classes: collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, membrane-type MMPs and other enzymes such as enamelysin [5]. All types of MMPs are multidomain enzymes, generally constituted at least by a prodomain and a catalytic domain [6]. The catalytic domain (approximately 170 amino acids) shows the same overall folding in all MMPs and contains two zinc(II) and two or three calcium(II) ions. One of the zinc ions has a catalytic function, while the other metal ions play a structural role. A deep cleft around the catalytic zinc, which includes the so-called hydrophobic S10 pocket, delineates the active site and substrate binding of all MMPs. A significant interaction between MMPs and their

substrates occurs between the S10 pocket and the P10 residue of the substrate [6, 7] (Fig. S1). The catalytic reaction occurs at the catalytic zinc(II) ion where a zinc-activated water molecule performs a nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl of the peptide bond of the substrate and donates a proton to a Glu residue, which transfers it to the nitrogen of the scissile amide. During this process the positively charged zinc(II) ion helps to stabilize the negative charge at the carbonyl moiety of the scissile amide [8, 9]. In normal tissues, the activity of MMPs is regulated by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which are natural inhibitors of MMPs. Nevertheless, chronic activation of MMPs due to an imbalance between the activity of MMPs and TIMPs results in an excessive degradation of ECM components which is associated with numerous pathological conditions such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, arthritis and aneurysms [5, 10]. Consequently, the development of molecules capable of inhibiting MMP activity is quite relevant in the field of drug discovery and has led to intensive research [1­3, 7, 11, 12] focused on the design and synthesis of high-affinity low molecular mass inhibitors of this family of proteins. In general, three are the main determinants of the inhibitor­protein interaction in the MMP active site: the nature of the catalytic zinc-coordinating group, the presence of inhibitor­enzyme hydrogen bonds, and the hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitor and the S10 pocket residues. Several examples of peptidic and nonpeptidic MMP inhibitors were reported in literature over the last several years, most of them containing hydroxamic acid as the zinc-coordinating group. Other zinc-binding ligands that have been utilized include carboxylic acids, thiols and phosphorus-containing substituents such as phosphonates [11]. Generally, the intrinsic binding affinity of hydroxamates for zinc is much stronger than that of the other kind of zinc-binding ligands [11, 13]. However, not only affinity, but also selectivity is the other determinant to take into account when efficient inhibitors are being looked for. Since MMP activity is an integral part of normal tissue remodeling, the possibility exists that the inhibition of a given MMP would be detrimental in a clinical setting because of undesired side effects. Indeed the action of the other MMPs can be inhibited as well, owing to the overall similarity of all the members of this protein family. A promising approach to obtain selective MMP inhibitors is to exploit the differences in the amino acids defining the active site and the S10 pocket in the various MMPs. In the present work we have structurally characterized the adducts of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (so-called stromelysin-1; MMP3 hereafter) [1­3] with three inhibitors (Table 1) where the zinc-coordinating group remains unchanged and the functional groups and/or substituents in positions P1, P2 and P3 were systematically varied.

Several MMP3 complexed with different type of inhibitors have been studied and well characterized either by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy [11, 14­ 19]. It was learned that specific residues of MMP3 within the S10 pocket play a role in modulating the affinity and selectivity towards different inhibitors [11]. Nevertheless, despite the high number of structures available, no clear and distinctive correlation between structural features and inhibitor affinities has been drawn. The three inhibitors for MMP3, selected in the present work, contain a hydroxamic group, targeted to bind the catalytic zinc ion and an aromatic moiety bearing different P1 substituents targeted to the hydrophobic S10 pocket. P1 varies from OCH3 in N-isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)glycyl hydroxamic acid (NNGH) to C6H5 in N-hydroxy-2-[N-(2-hydroxyethyl)biphenyl-4-sulfonamide] hydroxamic acid (MLC88), to C6H4CN in 3-(40 -cyanobiphenyl-4-yloxy)-N-hydroxypropionamide (InhVII) (Table 1). The hydroxamic and the aromatic groups are connected by a sulfonamide moiety in the case of NNGH and MLC88 and by an ether moiety in the case of InhVII. The analysis of the three structures obtained and the comparison with other previously resolved structures allow us to define a specific correlation between the size and the nature of the various substituents (i.e. organic side chains) of the inhibitors and the interactions and contacts they can make with protein, and consequently with their affinity constant.

Materials and methods Protein expression and purification The active form of the catalytic domain of stromelysin-1 (MMP3) was produced as previously reported [14]. The overexpressed MMP3 was found in inclusion bodies. The protein was extracted with 8 M urea buffer and refolded by direct dilution (1:200) in the presence of 0.3 M acetohydroxamic acid [14]. The activity of the MMP3 catalytic domain was tested by a colorimetric assay using the thiopeptolide Ac-Pro-Leu-Gly-S-Leu-Leu-Gly-OEt (Biomol cat. no. P-125) as a substrate. The specific activity was 49.8 U lg­1. One unit is defined as 100 pmol of peptide hydrolyzed per minute at 310 K. The MMP3­NNGH adduct was prepared by adding the NNGH inhibitor (Biomol Research Laboratories) during the refolding procedure. The MMP3 complexed with InhVII (Calbiochem) and with MLC88 (Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Florence) (Table 1) were prepared by titrating MMP3 with equimolar amounts of the abovementioned compounds. The typical protein concentration was around 1 mM. All three inhibitors analysed in our work

have Ki values on the order of nanomoles per litre. Therefore, the complex is fully formed upon addition of a stoichiometric amount of the inhibitor and the exchange between free and bound inhibitor is slow on the NMR time scale. The inhibition constant for MLC88 was determined by evaluating its ability to prevent the hydrolysis of the abovementioned thiopeptolide substrate. The latter measurement was performed in 50 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N0 -ethanesulfonic acid buffer, with 10 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, 0.1 mM ZnCl2 (pH 7.0), using 1 nM of enzyme and 1 lM of peptide at 298 K. The inhibition constants for NNGH and InhVII (Table 1) were previously reported in [20, 21] and were measured again by us, and we obtained values similar to those reported in the literature.

MMP3­NNGH complex: NMR experiments and structure calculations The solution structure of MMP3 complexed with the inhibitor NNGH (MMP3­NNGH hereafter) was obtained

by using standard NMR methods. Table S1 summarizes the experiments performed on the MMP3­NNGH adduct. Resonance assignments are reported in Table S2. Distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from 15N nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY)­ heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) and 13 C NOESY­HSQC spectra. Additional distance constraints between NNGH and the enzyme were extracted from a 2D 13C-filtered NOESY spectrum. Three-bond coupling constants, 3J, obtained from a 3D HN­Ha spectrum were translated into backbone dihedral angles using the corresponding Karplus curve. Further / and w torsion angles were estimated by the chemical shift index and added as restraints in the structure calculations as well. The intermolecular restraints involving the NNGH and the protein are listed in Table 2. Structure calculations were performed with the program CYANA 2.1 [22]. Metal ions were included following an already-reported procedure [14]. The 30 conformers with the lowest target function were refined through restraint energy minimization with the Amber 8.0 package [23]. The final structure of 30

a function of the relaxation delays to a single-exponential decay. Heteronuclear NOE values were calculated as the ratio of peak volumes in spectra recorded with and without saturation. The backbone 15N longitudinal R1 and transverse R2 relaxation rates have average values of 1.36 ± 0.15 and 12.3 ± 0.6 s­1, respectively. A correlation time (sr) of 9.5 ± 0.1 ns is obtained from the R2/R1 ratio, consistent with the size of the catalytic domain of MMP3 being in the monomeric state. The average value of the 1 H­15N NOEs is 0.79 ± 0.08, but it decreases to 0.68 ± 0.06 for residues in L8. The relaxation data (R1, R2 and 1H­15N NOE) were analysed according to the modelfree approach of Lipari and Szabo [28, 29], using the program TENSOR2 [30] (Fig. S4). Nuclear relaxation rates are expressed in terms of spectral density functions J(x) which depend on the overall rotational correlation time, sr, the generalized order parameter, S2, which describes the amplitude of local motions of backbone NHs occurring at rates faster than sr, and the correlation time for internal motions, se, faster than sr. The average S2 value is 0.85 ± 0.05 (Fig. S4). For some residues located in loops and particularly in L8 (region 218­226) the S2 parameters are lower (0.71 ± 0.06) than the average value.

Structural modeling The structural models of the adducts between MMP3 and the inhibitors InhVII and MLC88 were determined using a recently reported protocol developed in our laboratory [31]. The experimental restraints necessary to apply this approach derive from dipolar contacts between the protein and the inhibitor and were obtained, as protein­protein distances, from the analysis of 15N NOESY­HSQC spectra recorded for each of the two complexes. The approach described in [31] and used here consists of applying consecutive cycles of docking and energy minimization calculations until convergence of the structures is achieved. The experimental intermolecular NOEs, obtained from the analysis of 15N NOESY­HSQC spectra, were introduced in the minimization process to define the location and direction of the inhibitor in the protein cavity. Likewise, during the minimization process the surroundings of the inhibitor binding site were allowed to move without the application of any constraint. Indeed, no restrictions were imposed on the backbone and the side ° chains within an 8-A radius from the inhibitor. The docking calculations were performed with the program AUTODOCK [32] using the MMP3­NNGH solution structure without the NNGH molecule as the input structure to calculate the structural models of the MMP3­MLC88 and MMP3­InhVII adducts. In the first run, the amide groups with chemical shift variations, between MMP3­MLC88 or

conformers of the MMP3­NNGH complex has an average ° target function of 1.21 ± 0.14 A2 and a backbone relative ° root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.77 ± 0.10 A ° (1.35 ± 0.09 A for the heavy atoms). Per-residue RMSD values are shown in Fig. S2. Table S3 reports some statistics on constraint violations in the final structure together with selected quality parameters from PROCHECK-NMR and WHATIF analysis [24, 25]. A lyophilized sample of the MMP3­NNGH complex was dissolved in D2O to perform the H2O/D2O exchange experiments. Then 1H­15N HSQC spectra at 298 K were recorded every hour for 24 h. 15 N longitudinal R1 and transverse R2 relaxation rates [26], and the 1H­15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) [27] values were measured for the MMP3­NNGH adduct at 600 MHz (298 K) (Fig. S3, Table S1). The relaxation rates were obtained from the fitting of the cross-peak volumes as

MMP3­InhVII and MMP3­NNGH, larger than 0.15 ppm, taken as a threshold to monitor structural changes, were used to identify the protein binding site of the new inhibitor, i.e. to construct the initial grid for locating the inhibitor position in the protein scaffold. The combined chemical shift variations, reported in Fig. S5, were calculated from the experimental 1H and 15N chemical shift variations (Dd(1H) and Dd(15N), respectively) between corresponding peaks in the NNGH and the other inhibitor adduct through the following equation [33]: sffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2 1 ðDdð1 HÞÞ2 þ 25 ðDdð15 NÞÞ ¼ 2

The clusters of structures resulting from the AUTODOCK calculations with the lowest energy values were then subjected to energy minimization using the program XPLORNIH [34]. The experimental intermolecular NOE restraints between MMP3 and MLC88 or InhVII inhibitors were introduced in this step. From the 100 XPLOR-NIH minimized structures, the one with the lowest energy value was taken for subsequent cycles until convergence.

Results and discussion We structurally characterized the adducts of MMP3 with three different inhibitors by solving the solution structure of one adduct (MMP3­NNGH) and then by calculating structural models of the other two adducts using a reduced set of experimental NMR data, following a recently proposed procedure [31] (see ``Materials and methods''). We selected NNGH for the most extensive characterization as structures are available for its adduct with a number of other MMPs [35, 36]. The catalytic domain of the MMP3­NNGH adduct shows the classic fold common to all MMP catalytic domains structurally characterized up to now (Fig. 1) [37] which consists of three a-helices (a1, 110­127; a2, 195­ 207; a3, 236­246) and a twisted five-stranded b-sheet (96­ 102, 131­135, 142­147, 165­168, 176­181), organized in four parallel b-strands (b1, b2, b3 and b5) and one antiparallel b-strand (b4). The ligands of the metal ions were defined according to the X-ray structures of other MMP3 adducts, and here confirmed by NOE data. The catalytic Zn ion was included in the structure calculation based on the already available knowledge from X-ray structures [14­19] which implies that it is bound to His201, His205 (in a2) and His211 (in L8) and to the two oxygen atoms of the NNGH hydroxamate moiety. The structure is stabilized by several hydrophobic interactions and by a network of hydrogen bonds. The secondary structure elements are well ordered (backbone

° RMSD value within the family is 0.49 ± 0.07 A), while some loops (L hereafter), and particularly loops L5 (amino acids 154­164), L7 (amino acids 187­192) and L8 (amino acids 220­234), are more disordered (the average value of ° the backbone RMSD in loop regions is 0.81 ± 0.10 A). 15 Indeed, from the analysis of the N relaxation data it results that the loop regions, especially L8, are characterized by 15 N NOEs lower than the average and/or R1 values higher than the average (Fig. S3). This behaviour indicates that L8, which partially defines the S10 pocket for inhibitor binding, experiences motions faster than the overall protein reorientation time, and therefore has a high degree of flexibility. Furthermore some residues located in loops, and in a1 and a2, experience conformational exchange equilibria. Eighty-five amide protons were still present in the 1 H­15N HSQC spectrum 24 h after a lyophilized protein sample had been dissolved in D2O. Fifty-one of these are involved in hydrogen bonds between residues located in ahelix and b-strand secondary structure elements. Their solvent inaccessibility and slow exchangeability are the consequence of their protection due to extensive hydrogenbond networks. The position and conformation of the NNGH inhibitor inside the active site of MMP3 is well defined by 17 intermolecular NOEs (Table 2). In addition to the coordination of the hydroxamic acid group to the zinc ion, the inhibitor interacts with the protein through both hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds. A deep cleft close to the catalytic zinc binding site and defined by Leu197 and

Val198 (helix a2), on one side, and Tyr220, Pro221, Leu222, His224 and Leu226 (all located in L8), on the other, forms the S10 substrate binding site of the protein where the aromatic groups of the inhibitor, and most likely of the substrate, have the maximal interaction with the protein residues. The phenyl group of NNGH penetrates into this pocket, establishing well-defined hydrophobic contacts (Figs. 1, 2a), as monitored also by its NOE interactions with the side chains of residues forming this pocket (Leu197, Val198, His201, Leu222 and Tyr223). The methoxy group of NNGH has hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of some residues located in L8 (Leu218, Tyr220, Tyr223 and His224). Finally, the isobutyl side chain of NNGH is located in a shallow pocket, called the S20 pocket, which is essentially solventexposed. The Leu164 amide proton, which is still detectable in the spectrum recorded in D2O, forms a hydrogen bond with the sulfonyl oxygen of NNGH (the NH­O2 distance is ° found between 2.5 and 3.1 A). The latter also forms a hydrogen bond with the NH of Ala165, whose carbonyl oxygen in turn forms a hydrogen bond with the NH proton of the hydroxamic acid of NNGH, also confirmed by the shift of this proton (10.5 ppm). A further hydrogen bond between the Oe2 carboxylate of Glu202 and the hydroxyl hydrogen of the hydroxamic moiety, that remains protonated, is present in some of the conformers of the MMP3­ NNGH structure. This hydrogen bond is also observed in most of the X-ray structures of complexes of MMP3 with other inhibitors [14, 15, 38]. The comparison between the 1H­15N HSQC spectra of MMP3 complexed with NNGH with those of MMP3 bound

with either InhVII or MLC88 identified residues which experience different inhibitor­protein interactions with the various inhibitors. The MMP3­MLC88 adduct (Table 1, Fig. 2b) has a 1H­15N HSQC spectrum very similar to that of MMP3­NNGH, with only seven cross-peaks differing in chemical shift by more than 0.15 ppm (Fig. S5a). NOEs between the protons of the MLC88 biphenyl ring and the amide protons of Leu164, Leu197, and Val198 were observed for a total of five protein­inhibitor NOEs (Table 2). Two clusters of structural models of possible adducts with similar energies were obtained (Fig. S6a). In both clusters the biphenyl ring is pointing towards the S10 pocket and the sulfonyl oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the amide proton of Leu164. However, only in the first cluster the hydroxamic group has the correct conformation to bind the zinc ion and for this reason the second one was discarded. The chemical shift variations between the MMP3­InhVII and the MMP3­NNGH adducts are larger than for MMP3­MLC88, with several residues, mainly located in L5, b4, L8 and helix a2, having shift variations larger than 0.3 ppm (Fig. S5b). Four NOEs between the aromatic ring of InhVII and the protein residues (Table 2) were used to calculate a structural model of this adduct (Fig. 2c). Two clusters of solutions were obtained and in both the aromatic ring of InhVII is oriented towards the S10 pocket. In the former cluster, the hydroxamic moiety has the same orientation with respect to the zinc ion as that found in the MMP3­NNGH complex, with the NH of the hydroxamic moiety and the hydroxyl atoms of InhVII making hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala165 and the carboxylate group of Glu202, respectively, as occurs in the

MMP3­NNGH complex. In contrast, in the latter cluster the hydroxamic group is rotated by 180° with respect to the former (Fig. S6b) and does not form any hydrogen-bond interactions, as evidenced experimentally. This last cluster was, consequently, discarded.

MMP3­inhibitor adducts: binding mode and affinity As already mentioned, we selected the three inhibitors with the criteria of maintaining in all of them the same zinccoordinating group (the hydroxamic moiety) and of selectively changing the functional groups and/or substituents in positions P1, P2 and P3 (Table 1). In this way, we can modulate the presence and the nature of the hydrogen bonds and the hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitor and the S10 pocket of the protein and correlate them with the inhibitor efficiency. In particular, the MLC88 molecule contains a more hydrophilic substituent at the sulfonamide nitrogen position with respect to NNGH and a phenyl group in P1 position, where NNGH has a methoxy group; InhVII is similar to MLC88 at the P1 position but lacks the sulfonamide group, with an ether moiety connecting the hydroxamic group with the biphenyl. The overall spatial arrangement of the three hydroxamic inhibitors in the MMP3 catalytic cavity is the same in the three structures. The hydroxamic group is bound to the catalytic zinc as a bidentate ligand, its NH makes a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala165, and the aromatic side chain of each inhibitor is pointing towards the S10 pocket of the enzyme (Fig. 2). However, minor, local differences in the structural arrangement are present which arise from local specific interactions. These subtle differences modulate the different MMP3 affinities

for each inhibitor, which vary for these relatively similar inhibitors by about 1 order of magnitude (Table 1). The biphenyl group of MLC88 penetrates as deeply as the methoxy group of NNGH does. Since both inhibitors have a sulfonamide moiety, we could suggest that one of the factors determining the conformation and location of an inhibitor could be dictated by the nature of the functional group in the P2 position (Table 1). This feature is also observed on comparing MMP3 structures complexed with several other hydroxamic-like inhibitors containing a sulfonamide moiety (Protein Data Bank IDs 1D8F, 1D7X, 1BQO, 1D8M) [14­19] where different substituents at the previously mentioned positions do not affect the orientation and the number of interactions of the substituent in position P1 inside the S10 cavity (Fig. 3a). The second phenyl ring in MLC88 has further interactions with the protein, in particular with the hydrophobic residues Leu197, Leu218 and Phe232 with respect to NNGH. The presence of a second phenyl ring, therefore, sizably increases the extent of the hydrophobic interactions with the S10 pocket, and indeed the inhibition constant of MLC88 is fivefold that of NNGH. The presence of a 2hydroxyethyl substituent versus an isobutyl one in the P3 position (Table 1), which accommodates itself in the solvent-exposed S20 pocket, could also contribute to make binding tighter in the former case, where a polar group is present. Similarly to MLC88, InhVII has a biphenyl group with an additional ­CN group in the para position on the terminal aromatic ring, but it lacks the sulfonamide moiety with respect to NNGH and MLC88 inhibitors. The lack of this moiety prevents InhVII from forming stabilizing hydrogen bonds between the sulfonyl oxygen atom and the amide protons of Leu164 and Ala165, present in the other

two MMP3 adducts, and allows the biphenyl group to enter ° much deeper in the S10 cavity (2.8 A) than the corresponding groups in the other adducts do. Moreover, the biphenyl plane in the MMP3­InhVII adduct is rotated between 60° and 90° with respect to the same plane in the MMP3­MLC88 and ­NNGH adducts. This is likely the consequence of both the lack of hydrogen bonds involving the sulfonamide group and the higher degree of conformational freedom of the linear InhVII, with respect to the other branched inhibitors. The InhVII inhibitor binds to MMP3 similarly to MLC88, markedly stronger than NNGH. The lack of the sulfonamide group, and therefore of the hydrogen bonds formed by it, should decrease the inhibitor affinity, but this is not observed experimentally. Other factor(s) should compensate the lack of these hydrogen bonds. Indeed, InhVII penetrates deeper in the MMP3 S10 pocket and thus its biphenyl group can maximize the hydrophobic protein­ inhibitor interactions, and minimize van der Waals repulsions. Thus, an inhibitor containing a lower number of substituents and a lower number of hydrogen bonds (such as InhVII) can better fit in the MMP3 protein cavity. The structures of these three MMP3­inhibitor adducts were also compared with other previously determined structures, where MMP3 is complexed with nonpeptidic inhibitors. The latter, which contain substituents such as a diphenyl piperidine or a fluorobiphenyl ethyl group, i.e. longer than that of InhVII [38, 39], do not penetrate into the S10 cavity as deep as InhVII (Fig. 3b). These inhibitors contain a sulfonamide or a carbonyl group, which, therefore can form hydrogen bonds with the amide protons of Leu164 and Ala165, thus preventing the hydrophobic substituent from entering deeper inside the cavity, as in the NNGH and MLC88 inhibitor cases. The lack of two hydrogen bonds and the presence of a number of hydrophobic protein­inhibitor interactions compensate each other, thus giving a Ki value of InhVII similar to that of MLC88. As the protein­inhibitor interactions can be modulated by the plasticity of the binding cavity, as indicated by the dynamic properties of the S10 pocket, not only specific interactions should be taken into account in designing and optimizing more efficient inhibitors, but also the ability of the protein to adapt itself to the inhibitor scaffold that according to its topology could penetrate differently in the protein cavity. Indeed, from the comparison of the present structures with those of the other hydroxamic inhibitor adducts with MMP3, it appears that in the S10 cavity the side chain of three residues has an orientation modulated by the inhibitor molecule. These residues are Phe154, Phe210 and Tyr223, located in L5 and L8. These regions are highly flexible, displaying backbone mobility on the nanosecond to picosecond time scale (Figs. S3, S4) and experience the largest

structural changes from one structure to another also in other MMPs [35, 40­43]. As a general rule arising from this structural analysis and from the comparison with structures previously reported, it appears that the sulfonamide group and the zinc ligand hydroxamic group are crucial factors determining the position of the hydrophobic group inside the S10 cavity and that a group in position P2, which is able to establish hydrogen bonds with the protein, would stack the inhibitor in that position, preventing it from penetrating deeper in the cavity and from establishing further interactions which would increase the affinity.

MMP3­inhibitor adducts: a comparison with other MMPs Adducts with NNGH were previously characterized also for matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP10) and matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) in terms of structures and of inhibition constants [35, 36]. The latter for MMP12 (13 nM) is 1 order of magnitude smaller than for MMP3 (130 nM) and MMP10 (100 nM). The mode of binding of the hydroxamate group and the number of hydrogen bonds present are the same for the three adducts, which have very ° similar structures (within 1.1 A of RMSD). The different affinity arises from different hydrophobic interactions. All residues located close to NNGH in the MMP cavity, except four, are conserved (Fig. 4b). While in MMP3 and MMP10 those four residues are the same or have similar properties (Asn162/His, Val198, Leu218 and His224/Asn, MMP3 numbering), they are different in MMP12 (in the order Gly, Thr, Val and Lys) (Fig. 4b). The similar or different nature of these residues correlates with the similar (for MMP3 and MMP10) or different (MMP12) Ki values, respectively. Of these residues, the bulkier side chains of Val and Leu in MMP3 and MMP10 versus the shorter ones in MMP12 point towards the site occupied by the methoxy and the aromatic ring of the NNGH inhibitor (Fig. 4a). This steric hindrance around the inhibitor could contribute to lowering the inhibitor affinity for MMP3. Specifically, Val198 in the MMP3­NNGH adduct should have a relevant role in this respect, as it has a more rigid conformation owing to its location in a secondary structural element, a2, while Leu218, being in a loop (Fig. 4a), could more easily adapt its conformation. We, therefore, suggest that bulky groups in position 198 (MMP3 numbering) could hamper to some extent the phenyl group of the inhibitor from optimally fitting in the protein cavity. The fact that these two amino acids are the same in MMP10 and MMP3, as their affinities for NNGH are, corroborates the crucial role of the residue in this position in determining the affinities of this type of inhibitor for the enzymes.

Conclusion The present detailed structural characterization, even if it comes after several other structures of complexes of the same protein, represents an important and quite valuable contribution to the understanding of the factors which modulate at the atomic level the protein affinity for a given inhibitor. By selectively changing the nature of the substituents in the inhibitor and analysing its interactions with the protein, we have learned that the affinity is a balance between different types of interactions and the specific position and conformation of the inhibitor in the protein cavity. We have shown that formation of hydrogen bonds, though stabilizing an inhibitor group in the protein cavity, could be detrimental for the overall inhibitor binding as the latter could be locked in a position. This would prevent its complete entry in the cavity, where it would be stabilized by several more hydrophobic interactions. The present observations could provide further guidelines for a more efficient rational drug design.
