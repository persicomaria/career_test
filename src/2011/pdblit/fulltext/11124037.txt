Department of Chemistry, City of London Polytechnic, Jewry Street, London EC3N 2EY, England Received November 7, 1977 Selective `%I-{ `H, 31P) heteronuclear triple-resonance experiments, in which )I(`H)B, was sufficiently large to give complete proton decoupling and y("P)B, was of a magnitude to give spin-tickling effects, have been used to study the molecule (13CH3)(*2CH3)P(S)P(S)(1ZCH3)2. By selective irradiation of weak transitions in the 31P spectrum the conaectivity relationships of the energy-level diagram were established and iJ(3rP-31P) was demonstrated to be negative. INTRODUCTION

Tetraorganobiphosphinedisulfides, R,P(S) . P(S)R,, are generally characterized by rather small values of the phosphorus-phosphorus nuclear spin-spin coupling constant 1J(31P-31P) (hereinafter referred to as J), especially when the organo-groups R are not bulky (1). They also have rather complex second-order proton spectra (2), and these factors have combined to make it difficult to determine the sign of J by conventional double-resonance methods. However, in the particular case of the important first member of the series with R = CH, (I) there is a considerable body of indirect evidence, including sign determinations in related molecules such as (CH,),P(S)P(Se)(CH,), (3) to show that J is negative, although a dissentient view has been expressed (4). A convenient alternative approach to this problem is to use the spectral simplification brought about by studying the natural abundance i3C spectrum under conditions of complete proton decoupling, so that one is dealing with an AXX' spin system, with A = i3C and X, X' = 3*P. When A and X are different nuclear species three coupling constants determine the spectra given by such a spin system, but it is generally more convenient to work in terms of the parameters N, L, and J defined as
N= JAx + J,,,, L = JAx - JAx,. J= J,,,.

In the experiments to be described the sign of J has been determined relative to that of N. The parameter N has previously been shown (I) to have the same sign as JAx, which is known to be positive (5).

examined as a saturated solution in CDCl, contained in a spinning tube of lo-mm o.d., and the deuterium signal from the solvent was used to provide the spectrometer locking signal. i3C spectra were obtained in Fourier transform mode at 15 MHz on a JEOL FX-60 spectrometer, the proton irradiation matching network of which was modified to permit simultaneous application of the 31P resonance frequency of ca. 24.2 MHz. This was derived from a Schlumberger FS-30 frequency synthesizer which was phase locked to the master clock of the spectrometer. In order to minimize effects due to differences in the extent of rf heating of the sample, "off-resonance" experiments were conducted by offsetting the irradiating frequency by several kilohertz, rather than by switching it off. For data acquisition, 4K points and a spectral width of 1 kHz were used, giving a digital resolution of 0.5 Hz/point in the transformed spectra, and a pulse repetition interval of 1 set with a pulse angle of ca. 50° was found to give an optimum signal-tonoise ratio. Typically, satisfactory spectra were obtained from 2000 transients. 31P spectra were recorded on the same instrument at 24.2 MHz, and under conditions of proton decoupling it was possible to record all of the 13C satellites in these spectra from ca. 3000 transients (corresponding to 2 hr of accumulation time).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The proton-decoupled r3C spectrum of (I) is shown in Fig. 1A and consists of six transitions, two of which are degenerate at v(13C) and two are at v(13C) ? N/2. The

proton-decoupled 31P spectrum consists of an intense centralline from species containing no magnetic carbon, flanked symmetrically (apart from small rUi3C isotopeeffects upon u(~`P) which do not exceed 0.3 Hz and which were allowed for in the spectral analysis by two ab subspectra arising from molecules (i3CH3)(CH3)P(S)P(S)(CH3),. Anafysis of these spectra yields N = 60.7, L = 36.1, 1J(31P-13C) = 48.4, 2J(31P---13C) = 12.3, J= 18.8; all +O.l Hz. These values are in close agreement with those (I) previously published. Studies of a wide range of organophosphorus compounds have shown that in most P(V) compounds 1J(31P-13C) is positive and is generally larger than 45 Hz, while 2J(31P--13C) is much smaller. Specifically, a value of +56.1 Hz was found (5) in Me,PS for the one-bond coupling, and it thus seems certain that in (I) this coupling is also positive, as assumed below.

FIG. 2. Energy-level diagram for the AXX' spin system provided by the "C and two 31P nuclei of `3CH,(`2CH,)P(S)P(S)(12CH3, under conditions of complete proton decoupling. The numbering of the levels follows that of Ref. (7) for the ABX spin system; the heavy lines represent A(`%) transitions, and the light limes X(-"P) transitions.

The energy-level diagram is depicted in Fig. 2, in which the numbering of the energy levels follows that of Ref. (7) for the ABX system and the 13C transitions are shown as heavy lines. There is an ambiguity in the numbering of the phosphorus transitions in this diagram which can be resolved only if the sign of J is known. It is clear from the connectivity relationships that the sign of J relative to that of N may be determined by selectively irradiating lines in the 31P spectrum and observing which of the lines at v(i3C) + N/2 is affected as a result of spin-tickling (8) behavior. Figure 3 shows the phosphorus spectrum schematically, with the spacing of the lines such that it is relatively easy to irradiate either [ 11 or 181 without significantly affecting any other line. It should be mentioned that as these lines are weak because of low transition probabilities, it is necessary to use correspondingly higher amplitudes of the irradiating field to achieve observable tickling effects (8), and there is consequently increased danger of also perturbing the stronger lines. However, in the present case this problem was not serious and was easily avoided by an appropriate choice of irradiating amplitude. As Figs. IB and C show, it was found that the weak line at highest frequency in the phosphorus

spectrum was associated with the 13C line at v(13C) - N/2, and the weak line at lowest frequency with that at v(W) + N/2. This makes it possible to number transitions 13-71 and 12-51 in the diagram and shows that N and J are of opposite sign, i.e., J is negative. It should further be noted that other W lines are also affected when [ 11 or 181 is irradiated: for example, [el is connected with [81, as predicted by the energy-level diagram. This observation gives no further information on relative signs and indeed there is none to be had, but it serves to confirm the correctness of the above analysis.

The negative sign of 1J(31P-31P) in (I) determined above is in line with the rather small values of +22.5 and -43.3 Hz found for this coupling constant in (CH,),P(S)P(S)(C,H,), (9) and (CH,),P(S)P(Se)(CH,), (3), respectively, and also with the numerically larger values of -103 and -109 Hz found in the two diastereomers of (t-C,H,)(CH,)P(S)P(S)(CH,)(t-C,H,) (10). It appears from these results that the increasing bulk of the groups attached to phosphorus makes the coupling constant more negative; this can be attributed to increasing s character in the P-C bonds and correspondingly reduced s character in the P-P bond, a situation parallel to that found for 1J(31P-31P) in species with P(III)-P(II1) bonds. It further appears possible that, in tetraorganophosphine disuli?des with sufficiently small C-P-C interbond angles, a positive value of J(31P-31P) might arise. The technique described above for determination of the sign of J could also have been used to measure its magnitude had this not been otherwise available (for example, had direct detection of the appropriate 31Plines proved difficult), since it was easy to attain a precision of kO.3 Hz in the spin-tickling experiments. On grounds of sensitivity the previously described (11) 1H-{31P} double-resonance approach is clearly superior for the determination of these parameters in this type of system, but when the proton spectrum is complex, or J is less than ca. 40 Hz, this method may fail. This is especially likely to be the case for longer-range couplings, and we are currently applying the present 13C-{ `H, 31P} technique to a variety of polyphosphorus compounds with phosphorus atoms separated by two or more bonds.
