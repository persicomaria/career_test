Tk-subtilisin [the mature domain of Pro-Tk-subtilisin in active form (Gly70Gly398)] from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis is matured from Pro-Tk-subtilisin [a subtilisin homologue from T. kodakaraensis in pro form (Gly1-Gly398)] upon autoprocessing and degradation of propeptide. Pro-Tk-subtilisin is characterized by extremely slow maturation at mild temperatures, but this maturation rate is greatly increased by a single Gly56  Ser mutation in the propeptide region. To analyze the role of Gly56, which assumes a left-handed conformation, Pro-Tk-subtilisin variants with complete amino acid substitutions at Gly56 were constructed. A comparison of their halo-forming activities suggests that all variants, except for Pro-G56W [Pro-G56X, Pro-Tk-subtilisin with Gly56  X mutation (X = any amino acid)], mature faster than WT. Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E with the lowest and highest maturation rates, respectively, among 19 variants, as well as WT and Pro-G56S, were overproduced, purified, and characterized. SDS-PAGE analyses and Tk-subtilisin activity assay indicated that their maturation rates increased in the order WT  Pro-G56W b Pro-G56S b ProG56E. The propeptides of these variants were also overproduced, purified, and characterized. The stability and inhibitory potency of these propeptides decreased in the order Tk-propeptide [propeptide of Tk-subtilisin (Gly1-Leu69)]  G56W-propeptide N G56S-propeptide N G56E-propeptide, indicating that they are inversely correlated with the maturation rates of Pro7-Tk-subtilisin and its derivatives. The crystal structures of these propeptides determined in complex with S324A-subtilisin indicate that the conformation of the propeptide is altered by the mutation, such that nonglycine residues at position 56 assume a right-handed conformation and hydrophobic interactions at the core region decrease. These results indicate that Gly56 is required in stabilizing the propeptide fold. Stabilization of this fold leads to strong binding of Tk-propeptide to Tk-subtilisin, high resistance of Tk-propeptide to proteolytic degradation, and slow maturation of Pro-Tk-subtilisin.

High Stability of Tk-Subtilisin Propeptide

Introduction
Tk-subtilisin [the mature domain of Pro-Tk-subtilisin in active form (Gly70-Gly398)] from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis is a homologue of bacterial subtilisins and shows 45­46% amino acid sequence identities to subtilisin E, subtilisin BPN, and subtilisin Carlsberg.1,2 It consists of a signal peptide (prepeptide) [Met(- 24)Ala(- 1)], a propeptide (Gly1-Leu69), and a mature domain (Gly70-Gly398). Like bacterial subtilisins,3,4 Tk-subtilisin is matured from Pro-Tk-subtilisin [a subtilisin homologue from T. kodakaraensis in pro form (Gly1-Gly398)] upon autoprocessing and degradation of the propeptide [Tk-propeptide; propeptide of Tk-subtilisin (Gly1-Leu69)]. However, the maturation process of Tk-subtilisin differs from that of bacterial subtilisins with regard to the Ca2 + requirement for folding of the mature domain.2 The maturation of bacterial subtilisins is dependent on the propeptide, which functions not only as an inhibitor of the cognate mature domain but also as an intramolecular chaperon that facilitates the folding of the mature domain.5­14 In the absence of the propeptide, the mature domain is folded into inactive form with a molten globule-like structure. Bacterial subtilisins do not require Ca2 + for activity or folding, but require it for stability.15­20 In contrast, Tk-subtilisin does not require the propeptide, but requires Ca2 + for the folding of the mature domain.21 Tk-subtilisin is folded into a molten globulelike structure, even in the presence of Tk-propeptide, when refolded in the absence of Ca2 +. However, Tk-subtilisin is folded into active form with an approximately 20% yield, even in the absence of Tkpropeptide, when refolded in the presence of Ca2 +. The crystal structure of the active-site mutant of Pro-Tk-subtilisin, Pro-S324A, which represents the unautoprocessed form,21 as well as those of the autoprocessed and matured forms,22 have recently been determined. The structure of the unautoprocessed form is basically identical with that of the autoprocessed form, except that the scissile peptide bond contacts with the active site, indicating that the folding process of Tk-subtilisin is almost fully completed prior to autoprocessing. The structure of the autoprocessed from is similar to those of the subtilisin E:propeptide23 and subtilisin BPN:propeptide24 complexes. However, the structure of Tk-subtilisin is different from those of bacterial subtilisins in the number of Ca2 +-binding sites. Tk-subtilisin has seven Ca2 +-binding sites, while bacterial subtilisins have only two. The Ca-1 site of Tk-subtilisin is conserved as the high-affinity Ca2 +-binding site (site 1 or site A) in the structures of bacterial subtilisins, while the other six sites are unique to Tk-subtilisin. Unlike bacterial subtilisins, which are effectively matured even at room temperature,13 Tk-subtilisin is effectively matured only at  80 °C because of an extremely slow maturation rate at lower temperatures.2 As a result, Escherichia coli transformants with a plasmid containing the entire pre-Pro-Tksubtilisin gene do not form a halo at 70 °C, but

form it at 80 °C, when grown on a casein plate and incubated overnight at various temperatures. We have recently shown that the maturation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin is greatly increased by a single Gly56  Ser mutation in the propeptide region and, therefore, the resultant mutant protein Pro-G56S [Pro-G56X, Pro-Tk-subtilisin with Gly56  X mutation (X = any amino acid)] exhibits halo-forming activities even at 60 °C.25 This mutation does not seriously affect the folding of Tk-subtilisin, but reduces the stability and inhibitory potency of Tk-propeptide. Tk-propeptide is highly structured in isolated form and is a potent inhibitor of Tk-subtilisin. Therefore, Pro-G56S more rapidly matures than the wild-type protein, probably because autoprocessed G56S-propeptide [Tk-propeptide with Gly56  X mutation (X = any amino acid)] is unstructured upon dissociation from Tk-subtilisin and is therefore easily degraded by Tk-subtilisin. Gly56 assumes a left-handed helical conformation, and other residues may not be permissible at this position in terms of the stability of Tk-propeptide. However, it remains to be determined whether Gly is the only permissible residue at this position, and the conformation of Tk-propeptide is significantly changed by the mutation of this residue into nonglycine residues. Therefore, it would be informative to construct the mutant proteins of Pro-Tk-subtilisin with complete amino acid substitutions at Gly56 and to characterize them biochemically and structurally. In this report, 18 mutant proteins of Pro-Tksubtilisin, in which Gly56 is replaced with amino acid residues other than Ser, were constructed and analyzed for halo-forming activities at various temperatures. Among them, Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E with the lowest and highest maturation rates, respectively, as well as their propeptides, were overproduced, purified, and analyzed biochemically. In addition, the crystal structures of G56E-, G56S-, and G56W-propeptides in complex with S324Asubtilisin were determined. Based on these results, we discuss the structural importance of left-handed Gly56. We also discuss the correlations between the stability and inhibitory potency of propeptides, and between the stability of propeptides and the maturation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin.

Results
Halo-forming activities of mutant proteins When the halo-forming activities of the 19 mutant proteins of Pro-Tk-subtilisin with complete amino acid substitutions at Gly56 were analyzed at 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C by casein plate assay, all mutant proteins, except for Pro-G56W, gave a halo at temperatures lower than that used in WT (data not shown). It remains to be determined whether these mutant proteins are secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli in pro form and matured to active form. However, E. coli transformants with pBR1560

derivative, which lacks presequence and contains only the Pro-Tk-subtilisin gene, also gave a halo (data not shown), suggesting that Pro-Tk-subtilisin accumulates in the cytoplasm of E. coli, regardless of whether the presequence is attached to its Nterminus, and is matured to active Tk-subtilisin. The temperature dependencies of the halo-forming activities of Pro-Tk-subtilisin (WT), Pro-G56S, Pro-G56W, and Pro-G56E are shown as typical examples in Fig. 1. WT and Pro-G56W gave a halo only at 80 °C; Pro-G56S gave a halo at  60 °C; and Pro-G56E gave a halo at all temperatures examined. Based on the difference in the temperature dependence of haloforming activities, the mutant proteins are classified into five groups (Table 1). Group 1 contains only WT and Pro-G56W, which give a halo only at 80 °C; group 2 contains only Pro-G56F, which gives a halo only at  70 °C. These results indicate that only nonpolar aromatic residues can be substituted for Gly56 without serious effects on the halo-forming activities of Pro-Tk-subtilisin. To examine whether most of the mutations at Gly56 increase the maturation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin similar to that of Gly56  Ser mutation25 and whether the increased maturation rate is inversely correlated with the stability and inhibitory potency of the propeptide, Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E were overproduced and purified, and the maturation rates were compared with those of WT and Pro-G56S. Pro-G56S and Pro-G56E represent group 3 and group 5 proteins, respectively. Overproduction and purification of Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E Like Pro-Tk-subtilisin and Pro-G56S, Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E were overproduced in inclusion

The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of ProG56W and Pro-G56E were nearly identical with those of Pro-Tk-subtilisin and Pro-G56S (Fig. 2a). This result suggests that the Gly56  Trp and Gly56  Glu mutations do not seriously affect the structure of Pro-Tk-subtilisin in a Ca2 + -free form. Maturation of Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E The maturation of Pro-G56W and Pro-G56E was analyzed at 20, 40, 60, and 80 °C by 15% Tricine­SDS-PAGE and Tk-subtilisin activity assay as described previously.25 For comparative purposes, the maturation of Pro-Tk-subtilisin and ProG56S was also analyzed.

PAGE, the change in the amounts of unautoprocessed and autoprocessed proteins (propeptide and Tk-subtilisin) during the maturation process can be monitored. While on Tk-subtilisin activity assay, the change in the amount of Tk-subtilisin, which does not form a complex with propeptides and is therefore enzymatically active, during the maturation process can be monitored.

Tricine­SDS-PAGE indicated that Pro-Tk-subtilisin, Pro-G56W, Pro-G56S, and Pro-G56E were rapidly autoprocessed into propeptide and Tk-subtilisin upon incubation in the presence of Ca2 + within 1 min at any temperature examined (Fig. 3). The amount of Tk-subtilisin was not seriously changed upon further incubation. These results suggest that the autoprocessing step of these proteins is very fast

With appropriate intervals shown at the top of the gel, the protein was precipitated with the addition of 112 l of trichloroacetic acid (100%, wt/vol), subjected to 15% Tricine­SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250.

1363 faster than Pro-Tk-subtilisin. It almost fully matured within 1 h at 80 °C; upon incubation for 3 h, it matured by approximately 80% at 60 °C, by 20% at 40 °C, and by 10% at 20 °C. Two other proteins, especially Pro-G56E, which matured fastest, matured much faster than Pro-Tk-subtilisin. ProG56S almost fully matured within 30 min at 80 °C and within 1 h at 60 °C. It matured by approximately 40% and 20% upon incubation at 40 and 20 °C for 3 h, respectively. Pro-G56E almost fully matured within 30 min even at 40 °C and matured by approximately 50% upon incubation at 20 °C for 3 h. These results are consistent with those obtained with 15% Tricine­SDS-PAGE. Overproduction and purification of propeptides G56W-propeptide was overproduced in soluble form and purified, like Tk-propeptide;2 while G56Epropeptide was overproduced in insoluble form, solubilized by 8 M urea, purified in the presence of 8 M urea, and refolded by removing urea, like G56Spropeptide. 25 The far-UV CD spectra of these proteins are compared with those of Tk-propeptide and G56S-propeptide in Fig. 2b. The shape of the spectrum varies for these propeptides. The depth of the spectrum at around 220 nm also varies for these propeptides, although the spectrum of G56Wpropeptide is similar to that of Tk-propeptide in

and is completed within 1 min even at 20 °C. In contrast, the subsequent degradation step of the propeptide is slow and temperature-dependent (Fig. 3), indicating that this step is a rate-limiting step of the maturation process. G56W-propeptide is completely degraded within 30 min at 80 °C, within 2 h at 60 °C, and within N3 h at 40 and 20 °C. Tkpropeptide is also completely degraded within 30 min at 80 °C, but is not completely degraded within 3 h even at 60 °C, indicating that the maturation rate of Pro-G56W is comparable to, but slightly higher than, that of Pro-Tk-subtilisin. The maturation rates of these proteins increase in the following order: WT  Pro-G56W b Pro-G56S b ProG56E. G56S-propeptide is completely degraded within 5 min at 80 °C, within 15 min at 60 °C, within 3 h at 40 °C, and within N 3 h at 20 °C, while ProG56E is completely degraded within 5 min at 80 °C, within 10 min at 60 °C, within 1 h at 40 °C, and within N 3 h at 20 °C. The Tk-subtilisin activity assay indicated that maturations of Pro-Tk-subtilisin, Pro-G56W, ProG56S, and Pro-G56E are temperature-dependent (Fig. 4). Among these proteins, Pro-Tk-subtilisin matured most slowly. It almost fully matured within 1 h at 80 °C, but did not fully mature within 3 h at  60 °C. Upon incubation for 3 h, Pro-Tk-subtilisin matured by approximately 60% at 60 °C and by b 10% at 40 and 20 °C. Pro-G56W matured slightly

Pro-Tk-subtilisin (WT), Pro-G56W, Pro-G56S, and Pro-G56E were incubated at a concentration of 0.3 M in 50 mM CAPS-NaOH (pH 9.5) containing 5 mM CaCl2 at 20 °C ( ), 40 °C (), 60 °C (), and 80 °C (). With appropriate intervals, an aliquot (10 l) was withdrawn and determined for enzymatic activity at 20 °C using Suc-AAPF-pNA as a substrate, as described in Materials and Methods. Absorbance at 410 nm, which increases as the amount of Tk-subtilisin increases, is plotted as a function of time.

1364 this depth. As a result, the depths of the CD spectra of these propeptides at around 220 nm decrease in the following order: Tk-propeptide  G56W-propeptide N G56S-propeptide N G56E-propeptide, suggesting that the stabilities of these propeptides decrease in this order. Inhibitory potency of propeptides Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of Tk-subtilisin (2 nM) with G56W- and G56E-propeptides was analyzed at 20 °C using N-succinyl-Ala-AlaPro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA) as a substrate. Inhibition of this activity with Tk-propeptide and G56S-propeptide was also analyzed for comparative purposes. The inhibitory potencies of these propeptides were analyzed at such a low temperature because these propeptides, especially G56Epropeptide, are rapidly degraded by Tk-subtilisin at temperatures higher than 40 °C. Among the four propeptides, G56E-propeptide is most sensitive to proteolytic degradation and is gradually degraded by Tk-subtilisin even at 20 °C. However, this degradation seems to be too slow to seriously affect the concentration of G56E-propeptide during assay. As shown in Fig. 5, Tk-subtilisin activity was

inhibited by these propeptides in a concentrationdependent manner. The concentration of the propeptide required for complete inhibition of the Tksubtilisin activity varies for different propeptides. This concentration is around 50 nM for Tk-propeptide, 200 nM for G56W-propeptide, 1 M for G56Spropeptide, and 1.5 M for G56E-propeptide. These results suggest that Tk-propeptide inhibits the Tksubtilisin activity most strongly and that the inhibitory potencies of these propeptides decrease in the following order: Tk-propeptide N G56W-propeptide N G56S-propeptide N G56E-propeptide. The curves shown in Fig. 5 reveal a hyperbolic pattern due to a slow binding inhibition of propeptides. This unique inhibition mode has also been reported for propeptides of bacterial subtilisins.26,27 Calorimetric titration with propeptides Binding of the propeptides to Tk-subtilisin was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) using the active-site mutant S324A-subtilisin. This mutant was used to prevent degradation of the propeptides by Tk-subtilisin. ITC experiments were performed by injecting the solution containing the propeptide (140 M) into a sample chamber, which

The indicated concentration of Tk-propeptide (WT), G56W-propeptide (G56W), G56S-propeptide (G56S), and G56E-propeptide (G56E) was premixed with the substrate (Suc-AAPF-pNA) before Tk-subtilisin was added. Hydrolysis of Suc-AAPF-pNA (2 mM) by Tk-subtilisin (2 nM) was analyzed at 20 °C by monitoring an increase in absorbance at 410 nm, which results from a release of p-nitroaniline.

1365 in isolated form, for decreased binding affinity to Tk-subtilisin, and for the increased maturation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin. To reveal a structural basis for the decreased stability of the mutant propeptide, G56S-, G56E-, and G56W-propeptides were crystallized in complex with S324A-subtilisin, and the crystal structures were determined at resolutions of 1.8­1.9 Å. The binding of G56S- and G56E-propeptides to S324A-subtilisin was not detectable in titration experiments, yet their complexes could be obtained because S324A-subtilisin was refolded in the presence of these propeptides. The yields of these complexes were much lower than those of the Tk-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin and G56W-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complexes. However, these complexes were stable once formed and could be purified for structural analyses. The asymmetric unit of these crystals consists of one molecule of S324A-subtilisin containing 318 of 329 residues with 11 N-terminal residues (Gly70-Thr80) missing; one molecule of the G56S- or G56E-propeptide containing 65 of 69 residues with 4 N-terminal residues (Gly1-Asn4) missing; or one molecule of the G56Wpropeptide containing 66 of 69 residues with 3 N-terminal residues (Gly1-Gln3) missing. The overall structure of the G56S-propeptide: S324A-subtilisin complex is shown as a representative in Fig. 7a. A comparison of this structure with that of the Tk-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex, which has recently been determined,22 indicates that

contained the solution of S324A-subtilisin (14 M). Heat changes upon propeptide binding were not observed for G56S-propeptide and G56E-propeptide (data not shown), but were observed for Tkpropeptide and G56W-propeptide (Fig. 6), indicating that G56S- and G56E-propeptides do not bind or poorly bind to S324A-subtilisin in this condition. From these ITC titration curves, the number of the propeptides bound to S324A-subtilisin was calculated to be 1.19 ± 0.09 for Tk-propeptide and 1.15 ± 0.09 for G56W-propeptide. The dissociation constants (Kd) of Tk-propeptide and G56W-propeptide for binding to S324A-subtilisin were calculated to be 3.4 ± 0.3 nM and 16 ± 0.8 nM, respectively, indicating that G56W-propeptide binds to the mature domain less strongly than Tk-propeptide. The dissociation constants of G56S- and G56E-propeptides could not be determined because these propeptides precipitated when their concentrations were increased 10 times. It is necessary to increase their concentrations by at least 10 times to detect a weak interaction between G56S- or G56E-propeptide and S324A-subtilisin. Crystal structures of the complexes between propeptides and S324A-subtilisin The biochemical characterizations of mutant propeptides suggest that destabilization of the propeptide is responsible for its decreased stability

1366 these two structures are highly similar to each other, with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of 0.19 Å for 318 C atoms from Gln81 to Gly398 in S324A-subtilisin, and 0.76 Å for 65 C atoms from Thr5 to Gly69 in the propeptide. Likewise, the structures of the G56E-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin and G56W-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complexes are highly similar to that of the Tk-propeptide: S324A-subtilisin complex, with r.m.s.d. values of 0.092 and 0.16 Å for 318 C atoms from Gln81 to Gly398 in S324A-subtilisin, and 0.99 and 0.90 Å for 65 C atoms from Thr5 to Gly69 in the propeptide, respectively. However, a pronounced difference is observed around the mutation site, which is located far from the interface between the propeptide and the mature domain, for all mutant propeptides. The structures of G56S-, G56E-, and G56Wpropeptides are superimposed on that of Tkpropeptide in Fig. 7b­d, respectively. A comparison of these structures indicates that the conformation of Tk-propeptide is changed by the mutation at Gly56, such that two antiparallel -helices (1p and 2p) widen at one end, regardless of the amino acid residue substituted at this position. This conformational change leads to partial exposure of the hydrophobic core. In contrast, the structure of the other side of the propeptide, which is in direct contact with the mature domain, is not seriously changed by the mutation. The r.m.s.d. values between the mutant and WT propeptides decreased to 0.2­0.3 when residues 13­24 and 45­58 were removed, indicating that the structural changes in these regions account for the relatively high r.m.s.d. values in the propeptide as compared to those in the mature domain.

Discussion
Requirement of Gly56 for structural integrity In this study, we showed that Gly56 is required for the structural integrity of Tk-propeptide. Gly56 is located at the surface loop between 2p-helix and 4p-strand. A comparison of the crystal structures of Tk-propeptide and its mutants indicates that the local backbone structure of this residue is greatly changed by the mutation. The (, ) values of resi-

due 56 are (84.1°, - 9.2°) in Tk-propeptide, (- 74.7°, - 19.7°) in G56S-propeptide, (- 71.3°, - 14.2°) in G56E-propeptide, and (- 80.4°, - 1.5°) in G56Wpropeptide. According to the statistical analyses of backbone conformational angles by Nicholson et al. and of designation by Efimov, the backbone conformation of Gly56 in Tk-propeptide is defined as left-handed L conformation, while other nonglycine residues in the mutant propeptides are defined as right-handed R or R conformation.28,29 The corresponding residues in bacterial propeptides (Ser for subtilisins E and BPN) also assume a right-handed helical conformation.23,24 It has been reported that nonglycine residues are energetically unfavorable for left-handed helical conformation because of the local steric interaction of backbone atoms and the side-chain C atom.28,30­32 Therefore, to cancel this conformational strain, the backbone conformation of Gly56 in Tk-propeptide is greatly changed from left-handed to right-handed ones when Gly56 is replaced by nonglycine residues. However, this conformational change forcibly shifts the position of Phe17 located at the preceding loop of 1p-helix to cancel the steric hindrance between Phe17 and Ser56 or Trp56, or the position of Glu21 located within 1p-helix to cancel the negative charge repulsion between Glu21 and Glu56. As a result, the conformation of Tk-propeptide is changed, such that two antiparallel helices 1p and 2p widen at one end. Tk-propeptide consists of a four-stranded antiparallel -sheet (1p­4p) and two antiparallel -helices (1p and 2p). This structure is stabilized by the hydrophobic core, which is formed by 11 amino acid residues, Val8, Val10, Val12, Phe17, Val22, Ile25, Val39, Val41, Val43, Leu51, and Val57 (Fig. 7b­d). This number is roughly twice that of bacterial propeptides, 23, 24 suggesting that the hydrophobic core of Tk-propeptide is highly more stable than those of bacterial propeptides. Because of the formation of this highly stabilized hydrophobic core, Tk-propeptide is probably kept folded even in isolated form. However, along with the conformational change caused by the mutation, the hydrophobic core is partially exposed to the solvent, and the positions of the hydrophobic-core-forming residues, especially Phe17, are shifted (Fig. 7b­d). These changes probably reduce the hydrophobic interactions of these residues and thereby destabilize the

(a) The entire structure of the G56S-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex is superimposed on that of the Tk-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex (Protein Data Bank code 2Z30). For the structure of the G56S-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex, G56S-propeptide is in red and S324A-subtilisin is in green. Two active-site residues (Asp115 and His153) and Ala324, which is substituted for the active-site serine residue, are indicated by yellow stick models, in which the oxygen and nitrogen atoms are in red and blue, respectively. Seven Ca2 + are shown in cyan spheres. N and C represent the N- and C-termini, respectively. The entire structure of the Tk-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex, including seven Ca2 +, is in gray. (b­d) G56S-propeptide (b), G56E-propeptide (c), and G56W-propeptide (d) in the structures of the G56S-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin, G56Epropeptide:S324A-subtilisin, and G56W-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complexes are superimposed on Tk-propeptide in the structure of the Tk-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex. The view direction is changed from (a), such that the mature domain is located behind the propeptide. The mutant and wild-type propeptides are in red and gray, respectively. Nine of the 11 residues that form a hydrophobic core and Ser56 (b), Glu56 (c), or Trp56 (d) are indicated by blue and yellow stick models, respectively. Two other core-forming residues are not shown because they are hidden.

High Stability of Tk-Subtilisin Propeptide

1369 However, the yield of Tk-subtilisin matured from Pro-G56S or Pro-G56E at 80 °C is comparable to that matured from Pro-Tk-subtilisin or Pro-G56W, suggesting that the intramolecular chaperon function of Tk-propeptide is not correlated with its stability and inhibitory potency. The mutant propeptides are unstructured when they are dissociated from the mature domain and thereby exhibit weak inhibitory potencies and intermolecular chaperon function. However, when they are covalently linked to the mature domain, they are probably kept folded through the interaction with the mature domain and prevent incorrect folding of the mature domain. A similar result--that the intramolecular chaperon function of the propeptide is not necessarily correlated with its inhibitory activity--has also been reported for bacterial subtilisin.12,36 The average B-factor of the propeptide is 2.5-fold larger than that of the mature domain in the bacterial propeptide:subtilisin complex.23 The average B-factor of Tk-propeptide (19.8) is also 1.7-fold larger than that of S324A-subtilisin (11.8) in the complex, suggesting that Tk-propeptide is more flexible than the mature domain in the complex. However, the average B-factors of the mutant propeptides are 1.3- to 1.7-fold larger than that of S324A-subtilisin in the corresponding complexes only, suggesting that the flexibility of the propeptide in the complex is not seriously changed by the mutation at Gly56. In addition, the interface between the propeptide and the mature domain is nearly unchanged by the mutation. These results also suggest that the intramolecular chaperon function of Tk-propeptide is not seriously changed by the mutation at Gly56. Pro-G56S and Pro-G56E effectively mature not only at 80 °C but also at lower temperatures, probably because G56S- and G56E-propeptides autoprocessed from Tk-subtilisin are unstructured when they are dissociated from Tk-subtilisin and therefore are rapidly degraded by Tk-subtilisin at these temperatures. Then a question arises on whether the high stability of Tk-propeptide and the slow maturation of Pro-Tk-subtilisin are related to the adaptation of its source organism to extremely high temperatures. Rapid maturation of Pro-Tk-subtilisin after secretion into the external medium may induce growth defects in cells for unknown reasons. Alternatively, the maturation yield of Pro-Tk-subtilisin may be greatly decreased by the mutation at Gly56 in vivo. This yield may be different from that detected in vitro because the protein is always exposed to high temperatures (80­90 °C) during its synthesis, secretion, folding, and maturation in vivo.

hydrophobic core of Tk-propeptide. This may be the reason that the mutant propeptides are less structured than the WT propeptide in isolated form. G56W-propeptide with a similar structural change around the mutation site is not less structured than Tk-propeptide, probably because Trp56 fills the space between helices 1p and 2p and makes an aromatic interaction with Phe17. Destabilization of the propeptide by the structural changes around the mutation site may be cancelled by its stabilization by the hydrophobic and aromatic interactions between Trp56 and surrounding residues. The B-factor of residue 56 is comparable to the average B-factor of the propeptide, regardless of whether the nonglycine residue is introduced into this position, indicating that the backbone conformation of residue 56 is not rigid enough to force it to assume a left-handed helical conformation. Gly56 is preceded by the proline residue (Pro55), which is fully conserved in bacterial propeptides. The conformation of Pro55 is also greatly changed by the mutation at Gly56. Pro55 assumes a  conformation in Tk-propeptide, while it assumes a right-handed helical conformation in the mutant propeptides, such as that in bacterial propeptides. Therefore, it would be informative to examine whether the mutation of Pro55 increases backbone flexibility and thereby compensates for the mutation at Gly56. Correlations of stability, binding affinity, inhibitory potency, and chaperon function of propeptide In this study, we showed that the stabilities of Tk-, G56S-, G56W-, and G56E-propeptides are correlated with their binding affinities to Tk-subtilisin and inhibitory potencies. These relationships have been reported for the propeptides of bacterial subtilisins as well. These propeptides are almost fully disordered in isolated form,6,7,27,33 but adopt a significant secondary structure in the presence of 10% glycerol.13 The association constant for the interaction between the propeptide and subtilisin E increases 10 times in the presence of 10% glycerol.13 Likewise, the mutants of bacterial propeptides with increased secondary structure in isolated form are more potent inhibitors of cognate subtilisin activities.6,12,26 Bacterial propeptides with increased secondary structure in isolated form have been reported to exhibit a higher chaperon function than the wildtype ones.7,12,34,35 We have previously shown that the yield of Tk-subtilisin from that refolded in the absence of Ca2 + [Tk-subtilisin- , Tk-subtilisin refolded in the absence of Ca2 +] is very low, but greatly increases when Tk-propeptide is added in trans.2 This yield only slightly increases when G56Spropeptide is added in trans.25 This yield also greatly increases when G56W-propeptide is added in trans, but does not seriously increase when G56E-propeptide is added in trans (data not shown). These results suggest that the intermolecular chaperon function of Tk-propeptide is correlated with its stability.

from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., and BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIL [F - ompT hsdS (rB- mB-) dcm+ Tetr gal (DE3) endA Hte (argU ileY leuW Camr)] was from Stratagene. Plasmid pBR1560, with the insertion of the 1560-bp DNA fragment containing the entire pre-Pro-Tk-subtilisin gene at the HindIII-BamHI sites of pBR322, was previously constructed.25 Plasmid pET25b was from Novagen. Site-directed mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmid pBR1560 was used as a template. Eighteen combinations of 5 and 3 mutagenic primers were designed such that the codon for Gly56 is changed to that for one of the amino acid residues other than Ser. The resultant pBR1560 derivatives were used to transform E. coli HB101 for casein plate assay. PCR was carried out with GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer) for 35 cycles using KOD polymerase (Toyobo). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by a Prism 310 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science. Casein plate assay E. coli HB101 transformants with the pBR1560 derivatives were grown on a Luria­Bertani (LB) medium agar plate containing 50 g/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 16 h. Colonies were transferred to the LB plate containing 1% casein and 2% gellan gum, and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. The casein plates were then overlaid with 2% gellan gum and 1% Tween 20 for the lysis of E. coli cells and incubated at 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C for 24 h. The hydrolysis of casein by Tk-subtilisin was detected by the formation of a white halo around the colony. Overproduction and purification The pET25b derivatives for overproduction of ProG56W, Pro-G56E, G56W-propeptide, and G56E-propeptide were constructed as described for Pro-G56S and G56S-propeptide.25 Overproduction of these proteins using the E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL transformants with the pET25b derivatives and purification of these proteins, except for G56W-propeptide, were also carried out as described for Pro-G56S and G56S-propeptide.25 G56Wpropeptide was purified as described for Tk-propeptide.2 Pro-Tk-subtilisin and Tk-propeptide,2 and Pro-G56S and G56S-propeptide,25 were overproduced and purified as described previously. Tk-subtilisin, which was previously designated as mat-Tk-subtilisin, was matured from ProTk-subtilisin by incubating it at 80 °C for 90 min in the presence of Ca2+ as described previously2 and used without further purification. Tk-subtilisin refolded in the absence of Ca2 + , which was previously designated as mat-Tksubtilisin,2 will be designated as Tk-subtilisin- hereinafter. S324A-subtilisin was overproduced in inclusion bodies, solubilized by 8 M urea, and purified in denatured form as described previously.21 S324A-subtilisin with a native structure was prepared by refolding S324A-subtilisin in the presence of Ca2 +, followed by digestion with chymotrypsin at 30 °C for 1 h in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:1000. In this condition, S324A-subtilisin refolded in the absence of Ca2 + or incorrectly refolded in the presence of Ca2 + is completely

degraded by chymotrypsin, whereas S324A-subtilisin correctly refolded in the presence of Ca2 + is not.21 S324Asubtilisin with a native structure was purified by a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mM CaCl2. The protein was eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of approximately 0.25 M by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.4 M. S324A-subtilisin with a native structure and refolded in the absence of Ca2 + will be designated as S324A-subtilisin and S324A-subtilisin- [Tk-subtilisin- with Ser324  Ala mutation], respectively, hereinafter. The propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex was prepared by refolding S324A-subtilisin- in the presence of the propeptide and Ca2 +. S324A-subtilisin- (450 M) was first incubated in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) containing 6 M guanidine HCl at 25 °C for 1 h for unfolding. The protein was then refolded by 100-fold dilution with 20 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 8.3 M propeptide (Tk-, G56S-, G56W-, or G56E-propeptide) at 4 °C for 1 day. The resultant solution was centrifuged at 30,000g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove any precipitate and applied to a HiTrap Q HP column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mM CaCl2. The propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex was eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of approximately 0.15 M by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.4 M. The fractions containing this complex were collected, dialyzed against 5 mM Tris­ HCl (pH 7.0), and used for crystallization. The purities of the proteins were analyzed by 15% Tricine­SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. Protein concentration The protein concentration was determined from UV absorption at 280 nm, on the basis that the absorbance of a 0.1% (1 mg/ml) solution at 280 nm is 1.25 for Pro-Tksubtilisin, Pro-G56S, and Pro-G56E; 1.34 for Pro-G56W; 1.47 for S324A-subtilisin; 0.21 for Tk-, G56S-, and G56Epropeptides; and 0.92 for G56W-propeptide. These values were calculated by using absorption coefficients of 1526 M -1 cm- 1 for tyrosine and 5225 M- 1 cm- 1 for tryptophan at 280 nm.37 The concentration of the propeptide: S324A-subtilisin complex was determined on the assumption that the absorbance of a 0.1% (1 mg/ml) solution of the complex at 280 nm is identical with that of the unautoprocessed form. Enzymatic activity The enzymatic activity of Tk-subtilisin was determined using Suc-AAPF-pNA (Sigma) as a substrate as described previously.2 The reaction mixture contained 50 mM N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (CAPS)NaOH (pH 9.5), 5 mM CaCl2, and 2 mM Suc-AAPF-pNA. The reaction mixture (100 l) was incubated at 20 °C, and the amount of p-nitroaniline released from the substrate was determined from absorbance at 410 nm with an absorption coefficient of 8900 M- 1 cm- 1 by an automatic UV spectrophotometer (model DU640; Beckman). One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 mol/min p-nitroaniline. Specific  http://hincklab.uthscsa.edu/html/protocols/tricine_ sds.shtml

Protein crystallization The purified propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complexes were concentrated to 8 mg/ml using an ultrafiltration system Microcon (Millipore). These complexes were crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method using 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6) containing 10% (vol/vol) isopropanol and 0.2 M zinc acetate for the G56S-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin and G56E-propeptide: S324A-subtilisin complexes, and 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 10% (vol/vol) isopropanol and 0.2 M zinc acetate for the G56W-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 l each of the protein solution and reservoir solution and were vaporequilibrated at 20 °C against 200 l of reservoir solution. Cube-shaped single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis appeared after 3­4 days. X-ray diffraction data collection and structure determination All crystals were soaked for 5 s in cryobuffers containing 18% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol (Hampton Research) prior to flash-freezing in a nitrogen-gas stream at 27 °C. X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at a wavelength of 1.0 Å on the BL44XU station using the multiple-imaging-plates diffractometer DIP6040 (G56S-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin and G56W-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complexes), or on the BL38B1 station using the ADSC Quantum4R CCD detector (G56E-propeptide:S324A-subtilisin complex) at

activity was defined as enzymatic activity per milligram of protein. CD spectra The far-UV (200­260 nm) CD spectra were measured on a J-725 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic) at 20 °C. The protein was dissolved in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5). The protein concentration and optical path length were 0.1­0.15 mg/ml and 2 mm, respectively. The mean residue ellipticity,  (expressed in ° cm2 dmol- 1), was calculated by using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110. Isothermal titration calorimetry ITC measurements were performed with a MicroCal VP-ITC titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) as described previously.38 The instrumentation and software for data acquisition/analysis were VPViewer IPC and MicroCal Origin (version 5), respectively. Data points were collected every 2 s. Prior to titration, both solutions of the propeptide (140 M) and S324A-subtilisin (14 M) were dialyzed against 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 mM CaCl2, filtered through a 0.22-M pore-size membrane, and degassed in a vacuum. An aliquot (10 l) of the propeptide solution was added to the reaction cell containing S324A-subtilisin at 30 °C with an interval of 5 min. Data from two independent experiments were averaged.

All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite.39 All structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using MOLREP40 in the CCP4 program suite. The 2.3-Å structure of Pro-S324A (Protein Data Bank entry 2E1P) was used as a starting model. Model building and refinement of the structures were carried out with the programs Coot41 and REFMAC42 in the CCP4 program suite. Progress in structural refinement was evaluated at each stage by the free R-factor and by inspection of stereochemical parameters calculated by the program PROCHECK.43 The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK showed that almost all residues in the structure were in the favored region.
