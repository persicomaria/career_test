The novel flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase, ThyX, is absent in humans but several pathogenic bacteria depend exclusively on ThyX activity to synthesize thymidylate. Reduction of the enzyme-bound FAD by NADPH is suggested to be the critical first step in ThyX catalysis. We soaked Mycobacterium tuberculosis ThyX-FAD-BrdUMP ternary complex crystals in a solution containing NADP+ to gain structural insights into the reductive step of the catalytic cycle. Surprisingly, the NADP+ displaced both FAD and BrdUMP from the active site. In the resultant ThyX-NADP+ binary complex, the AMP moiety is bound in a deep pocket similar to that of the same moiety of FAD in the ternary complex, while the nicotinamide part of NADP+ is engaged in a limited number of contacts with ThyX. The additional 2-phosphate group attached to the AMP ribose of NADP+ could be accommodated with minor rearrangement of water molecules. The newly introduced 2-phosphate groups are engaged in water-mediated interactions across the non-crystallographic 2-fold axis of the ThyX tetramer, suggesting possibilities for design of high-affinity bivalent inhibitors of this intriguing enzyme.

Emergence of resistance in several bacterial species, including Mycobacteria, to existing antibacterial therapeutics provides a strong incentive to explore new protein drug targets. 1,2 A recently discovered flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase, referred to as ThyX, represents one such potential target for new anti-bacterial drugs.3,4 ThyX, the translational product of the novel gene thyX, is an extremely promising antibacterial drug target, since the thyX gene is rare in eukaryotes and is absent in humans. A list of organisms that have thyX genes includes important human pathogens like Bacillus anthracis, Helicobacter pylori and the Mycobacteria. The expression of the thyX gene has been shown to be altered in different growth conditions of M. tuberculosis.5,6

We have previously determined the structure of M. tuberculosis ThyX (MtbThyX) in complex with the co-factor FAD and the substrate analog, BrdUMP.7 Reduction of FAD by pyridine nucleotides has been suggested to be the critical first step in ThyX catalysis.3,4,8 Further, the ThyX-FAD-dUMP ternary complex has been shown to be an efficient NADPH oxidase.9 Since the binding site of NADPH is not known, we investigated the effect of NADP+ on the crystals of the ThyX-FAD-BrdUMP ternary complex and obtained quite an unexpected result. Crystallization, data collection and structure determination The selenomethionine-containing Ile65Met/ Leu175Met mutant of MtbThyX was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells as C-terminal His6-tagged protein and purified as described.7 Protein samples, at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, were mixed with 100 M FAD and 6 mM

2 BrdUMP before crystallization. Crystals were obtained by the sitting-drop, vapor-diffusion method using equal volumes of protein and reservoir solution containing 13­15% (w/v) PEG 3350, 2 mM DTT and 100 mM potassium iodide in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5­5.5). For our current studies, crystals were soaked for 24­48 h with 30 mM NADP+ in the reservoir solution, and with 10% (w/v) PEG 6000 and 15% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant. Single-crystal diffraction data sets to a resolution of 2.0 Å were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) beam line 8.2.2 at a wavelength of 0.9795 Å using a quantum ADSC Q315 CCD detector. A total of 200 frames of 0.6° rotation were processed using the HKL2000 program suite.10 The structure was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe.11 A tetramer of the previously determined MtbThyX structure7 (PDB code 2AF6) was used as search model from which FAD, BrdUMP and water molecules were removed. The resultant model was refined with Refmac5,12 as implemented in the CCP4 program suite,13 and water molecules were added using ARP/wARP.14 Models were built and inspected using the program Coot.15 The tetramer of MtbThyX per asymmetric unit of the soaked crystals refined to an Rfree of 21.0% and an R value of 25.3%, with good stereochemical parameters (Table 1). Of the four subunits, essentially continuous chain tracing was possible for the A subunit, with only residues 53, 54 and 55 missing. In the B, C and D subunits, residues 111, 112 and 113, and the loop region 153­164, could not be built due to weaker electron density. In addition, 33 residues were modeled as alanine.

Structure of the MtbThyX-NADP+ complex Our earlier studies on the ternary ThyX-FADBrdUMP complex 7 revealed that the crystal contained two tetramers per asymmetric unit. Surprisingly, the soaking of the ternary complex crystals in 30 mM NADP+ solution resulted in three major changes. First, the asymmetric unit now contains only one tetramer, not two as observed in the ternary complex. Second, the electron density at the active site reveals that no isoalloxazine ring was present and that the substrate analog BrdUMP is missing. Third, the electron density at the previous FAD position corresponds to that of an NADP+ molecule. This replacement is established unambiguously by the clear density for the phosphate group at the 2-hydroxyl position of the adenosine ribose (Figure 1(a)). Further, since the reflection data was collected using a SeMet-containing ThyX crystal, we also calculated a single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD)-phased experimental electron density map using Se-sites as refined by SHARP,16 followed by density averaging using DM.17 The resultant fourfold averaged map was of superb quality and confirmed the results obtained via the molecular replacement procedure unambiguously (data not shown). NADP+ is bound to all of the four subunits with the best defined electron density in the C subunit. While the adenine moiety of the NADP+ is well defined and buried in a deep pocket, the nicotinamide ring is loosely bound and flexible (Figure 1(a)). Three subunits of MtbThyX contribute to the NADP+ binding site (Figure 1(b)) in each of the four active sites per tetramer, similar to the mode of FAD binding in the ternary complex.7 Residues 103­105 of the ThyX motif from subunit C approach the carboxamide group of NADP+ . The hydroxyl group of Ser105, the nucleophile in the ThyX catalysis, is at 3.2 Å from the nitrogen atom of the nicotinamide. The pyrophosphate and two ribose rings of NADP+ are bound by residues Arg95-His96-Arg97 of the ThyX motif, 3,7 by His194 from subunit B and by Arg190 from subunit A. The adenine ring and the pyrophosphate group are involved in several water-mediated interactions with the protein atoms. The 2-phosphate group of NADP+ is engaged mainly in water-mediated interactions with the protein. Of the three non-bridging oxygen atoms of the phosphate group, one interacts with a putative potassium ion, at 2.8 Å, which is bound by the AN3 nitrogen atom of the adenine ring of NADP+ (Figure 2). A second 2-phosphate oxygen atom interacts with water molecules W102 and W279, both of which are bound by Arg190 from the A subunit. The third 2-phosphate oxygen atom makes interesting bridging interactions through water molecules with the ribose and 2-phosphate of the NADP+ molecule of the neighboring subunit (Figure 2). This third 2-phosphate oxygen atom of the NADP+ bound to subunit C is linked via W160 to the 3-hydroyxl group of the ribose and to the

equivalent 2-phosphate oxygen atom of NADP+ bound to subunit D. A non-crystallographic 2-fold of the M. tuberculosis ThyX tetramer, which has D2 symmetry,7 causes the third 2-phosphate oxygen atom of subunit D to be linked via W168 to the 3hydroxyl group and the 2-phosphate oxygen atom of subunit C (Figure 2). The two 2-oxygen atoms bridging the ribose ring and the phosphate groups from subunits C and D are 4.0 Å apart. The corresponding distance between the ribose ring oxygen atoms is 3.2 Å. These two distances are similar those in the structure of the MtbThyX-FADBrdUMP ternary complex.7 Comparison with the structure of MtbThyX-FAD-BrduMP complex The 236 C atoms of the E and A subunits of MtbThyX-FAD-BrdUMP7 and the new MtbThyXNADP+ complex can be superimposed with an r.m. s.d. of 1.23 Å. Residue stretches 106­114 in loop L4 and 155­164 in the L5-5 show significant deviations between the two structures. Residues Arg107 and Tyr108, from the ThyX motif, interact with BrdUMP and FAD in the active site of the ternary MtbThyX-FAD-BrdUMP complex (see Figure 5(a) of

Sampathkumar et al.7), while Lys165 and Arg168, emerging from helix 5, play a role in positioning Arg107 and Tyr108.7 These interactions are absent from the binary MtbThyX-NADP+ complex due to the disappearance of BrdUMP, resulting in conformational changes, especially a displacement by 4.7 Å of residue Tyr108. Residues, Val109, Pro110, Glu111 and Lys112, following Tyr108 show deviations of 4.5 Å, 5.3 Å, 6.4 Å and 6.6 Å, respectively. It is also noteworthy that the residues between 153 and 164 are disordered in the B, C and D subunits of the MtbThyX-NADP+ complex. This is also likely due to expulsion of BrdUMP from the active site, whose position is occupied by water molecules in the MtbThyX-NADP+ complex. To analyze the environment of 2-phosphate group of NADP+ in the binary complex, the AMP portions of FAD and NADP+ were superimposed, and the resultant transformation operation was used to superimpose the MtbThyX-FAD-BrdUMP tetramer onto the MtbThyX-NADP+ tetramer. It appeared that the 2-phosphate group of NADP+ could be accommodated in the ternary complex without significant main-chain or side-chain conformational changes. Phosphate group binding resulted in expulsion of W870 and W540, bound to the A and

D subunits, respectively, of the ternary complex. Of the four 2-phosphate bridging water molecules between adjacent subunits, three are newly introduced into the MtbThyX-NADP+ complex (Figure 2). Implications for inhibitor design Our study did not result in an anticipated MtbThyX-FAD-BrdUMP-NADP+ quaternary complex but, instead, in a binary MthThyX-NADP + complex, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of NADP+ bound to a ThyX enzyme . This observation is in-line with the suggestion8,18 that NADPH might not be the biological reducing agent in Thermotoga maritima and Campylobacter jejuni ThyX catalysis. Further, the inhibitory effect of increasing concentrations of NADPH in ThyX catalysis8,18 could be explained on the basis that NADPH/NADP+ expels FAD, and hence dUMP also, by competing for the co-factor binding site in ThyX. The ``non-business'' end of FAD is identical with NADP+ but for the absence of the phosphate group attached to the AMP ribose. Since the nicotinamide group of NADP+ is weakly bound, the driving force for expulsion of FAD may be derived from the water-mediated interactions made by this additional phosphate group with its neighbor in the tetramer (Figure 2). The expulsion of the cofactor FAD by NADP+ in our studies was entirely unexpected, since the aim of the experiment was to determine the nature of NADP+ interactions with the presumably permanently bound FAD in a putative quaternary complex, thereby better understanding how NADPH brings about the reduction of FAD in the presence of the bound substrate analog BrdUMP. The full implication of our ThyX-NADP+ binary complex structure is likely to require further investigations, including detailed mechanistic studies, which are beyond the scope of this paper. Whatever the outcome of such studies, our results suggest an interesting way to arrive at bivalent compounds that could occupy both FAD-binding sites. For example,

phosphate group or phosphonate group-containing compounds could perhaps bridge adjacent adenosine moieties by connecting the 2-hydroxyl group or 2-carbon atoms of adenosine ribose. This would lead to bivalent inhibitors of ThyX with potentially much higher affinity than univalent molecules.19­22 The unexpected observation that NADP+ competes with both FAD and substrate for the binding site in ThyX and displace both molecules from the active site opens avenues for the design of tight-binding inhibitors of ThyX enzymes from a variety of organisms.
