The Gly42 f Val mutant of GiR1 was characterized structurally and biochemically to elucidate two important features of GiR1-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis. The crystal structure of the GTPS-bound G42VGiR1 protein demonstrates that the steric bulk of Val42 pushes the Gln204 residue into a catalytically incompetent conformation, providing a rationale for the diminished GTPase activity of this mutant. The same phenomenon may also account for the diminished GTPase activity of the homologous transforming Gly42 f Val mutation in p21ras. Similarly, the steric bulk of the unique Ser42 residue in GzR may account for the comparatively slower rate of GTP hydrolysis by this GR subunit. The G42VGiR1 subunit was also characterized structurally in its GDP,Pi- and GDP-bound states, providing a unique opportunity to view three "snapshots" of GTP hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of GTP to a transient GDP,Pi-bound intermediate is associated with substantial conformational changes in the switch II segment of the protein. Eventual release of Pi results in further removal of switch I from the active site and a highly mobile switch II segment. Despite their disparate biochemical properties, the structural similarity of G42VGiR1 to the G203AGiR1 mutant in the GDP,Pi-bound form suggests that both mutations stabilize a conformation of the GDP,Pi-bound protein that occurs only transiently in the wild-type protein. The structures of the GDPbound forms of the wild-type and mutant proteins are similar.
ABSTRACT:

Transient, high-affinity interactions between GTP and the R subunits of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins)1 activate the downstream signaling reactions that are initiated by these molecules (1-5). Binding of GTP to GR is catalyzed by an appropriate agonist-receptor complex, which facilitates dissociation of tightly bound GDP from the G protein heterotrimer. GTP, present in cells at much higher concentrations than GDP, fills the empty nucleotide binding site and causes conformational changes that result in dissociation of GR(GTP) from a high-affinity dimer of and  subunits (6). The intrinsic GTPase activity of GR eventually regenerates GR(GDP), and subsequent binding of G  completes the cycle. The GTPase reaction catalyzed by a variety of regulatory GTPases has been studied extensively because of its intrinsic biological importance, revealed in part by the consequences of its inhibition. Thus, cholera toxin-catalyzed ADPribosylation of the GR protein responsible for stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (GsR) inhibits its GTPase activity (7). Resultant persistent activation of the pathway causes uncontrolled synthesis of cyclic AMP and life-threatening diarrheal

disease. Mutations in p21ras that inactivate the GTPase activity of this protein (and render it unsusceptible to the activity of GTPase-activating proteins or GAPs) cause a large number of human malignancies; the Gly12 f Val mutation of p21ras is the most common of these alterations (8, 9). Gly12 in p21ras is located in the so-called P loop (GXXXXGK sequence motif), which is involved in binding the R- and -phosphates of nucleotides in many proteins (Table 1). Despite crystallographic studies that have documented the proximity of Gly12 to the catalytic Gln61 residue in p21ras, the explanation for the catalytic inactivity of Val12-p21ras remains unclear because the so-called switch II segment that includes Gln61 is poorly ordered (10-12). Most GR proteins also have P-loops with a conserved Gly residue that is homologous to Gly12 of p21ras. However, we originally felt that study of heterotrimeric G protein R subunits had little to contribute to the question of the importance of this Gly residue because the GTPase activity of the equivalent Gly49 f Val mutant of GsR was only modestly diminished (13).

GTPase-Deficient G Protein Mutants for several reasons. (1) The switch II segment in at least certain GTPS-bound GR proteins is well ordered compared to that of p21ras (14, 15). (2) GzR, a member of the Gi subfamily of GR subunits, is distinct because of very low GTPase activity (100-fold lower than GsR or GiR) and a unique TSN sequence in the P-loop rather than the consensus AGE in other GR proteins (16). (3) The Gly203 f Ala mutant of GiR1 (an unrelated Gly residue), a conformationally constrained protein, can be crystallized in an intermediate GR(GDP,Pi) state but not in its active GTPS-bound form (17). Wild-type GiR1 cannot be crystallized in its GDP,Pibound form. (4) Gly42 f Val GiR1 (analogous to Gly12 f Val p21ras), which has severely impaired GTPase activity (see below), can be crystallized in all three GTPS-, GDP-, and GDP,Pi-bound forms. Hence, this protein offers a unique opportunity to obtain three "snapshots" of guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolytic reactions as well as insights into the consequences of mutation at Gly42. MATERIALS AND METHODS Proteins and Plasmids. A cDNA containing the entire coding sequence of rat GiR1 was ligated into the EcoRI site of M13mp19. Mutagenesis was performed by the method of Kunkel et al. (18). The complete coding sequences of the G42V and G203A mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The complete coding sequences (NcoI-HindIII fragments) of the two mutants and the wildtype protein were subcloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of plasmid pQE-6. Other P-loop mutants were subcloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of plasmid H6pQE-6 to generate proteins with hexahistidine sequences at their amino termini. These plasmids were transformed together with plasmid pREP4 into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (19). GTPS Binding Kinetics. GiR1 proteins (200 nM) were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, 10 mM MgSO4, and 1 µM [35S]GTPS (3000 cpm/pmol). Aliquots (100 µL) were withdrawn at the indicated times, added to wash buffer at 0 °C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 25 mM MgCl2), and applied to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell BA-85, 0.45 µm); filters were washed and bound radioactivity was quantified (20). Values of kapp were calculated by a nonlinear least-squares fit to B ) Beq(1 e-kt). Note that kapp is also eqiuvalent to the dissociation rate of GDP. GTPS Dissociation Kinetics. GiR1 proteins (200 nM) were incubated for 90 min with 1 µM [35S]GTPS as described above. GTP was then added to a final concentration of 200 µM. Aliquots (80 µL) were withdrawn at the indicated times and counted as previously described to quantify GTPS binding. Values of kapp were calculated by a nonlinear least-squares fit to B ) Boe-kt. Steady-State Hydrolysis of GTP. GiR1 proteins (200 nM) were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, 10 mM MgSO4, and 2 µM [-32P]GTP (3000 cpm/pmol). At the indicated times, aliquots (50 µL) were withdrawn, added to 750 µL of 5% (w/v) Norit in 50 mM NaH2PO4 (0 °C), and vortexed. The charcoal was removed by centrifugation (2000 rpm for 10 min in a Beckman JA 4.2 rotor). The radioactivity in a

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 50, 1997 15661 400 µL aliquot of supernatant was quantified (21). Steadystate hydrolysis experiments were also performed with 50 mM NaMES (pH 5.6), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), or 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) in place of 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0). Measurement of kcat for Hydrolysis of GTP. GiR1 proteins (400 nM) were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, and 1 µM [-32P]GTP (7000 cpm/pmol) for 30 min. Single turnover GTP hydrolysis reactions were then initiated by the addition of GTP and MgSO4 to final concentrations of 100 µM and 20 mM, respectively. Aliquots (50 µL) were withdrawn at the indicated times and processed as described for the steadystate GTPase assay. Values of kcat were calculated by a nonlinear least-squares fit to B ) Beq(1 - e-kt). GAPstimulated GTPase reactions were analyzed in an analogous fashion in the presence of 400 nM RGS4 (22). Measurement of kpi for Hydrolysis of GTP. GiR1 proteins (400 nM) were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, and 1 µM [-32P]GTP (10 000 cpm/pmol) for 30 min. Single turnover GTP hydrolysis reactions were then initiated by the addition of GTP and MgSO4 to final concentrations of 100 µM and 20 mM, respectively. Aliquots (100 µL) were withdrawn at the indicated times, added to wash buffer at 0 °C (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 25 mM MgCl2), and filtered within 10 s using nitrocellulose filters as described above. Values of kpi were calculated by a nonlinear leastsquares fit to B ) Boe-kt. Measurement of Mg2+ Affinity. GiR1 proteins (300 nM) were incubated at 30 °C in 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, and 10 µM GTPS for 3 h. This mixture was divided into 600 µL aliquots, and MgSO4 was added (in 6 µL) to achieve the concentrations indicated. After 15 min at room temperature, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured with a SPEX Fluorolog 211 spectrophotometer using excitation and emission wavelengths of 289 and 349 nm, respectively (23). These data were fit to the equation F ) ax/(Kd + x), where F is Mg2+-induced fluorescence enhancement, x is the concentration of Mg2+, a is the maximum value F(x), and Kd is the dissociation constant for Mg2+. Trypsinization. GiR1 proteins (8 µg/45 µL) in 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, and 10 mM MgSO4 were incubated with either 100 µM GDP; 100 µM GDP, 10 mM NaF, and 60 µM AlCl3; or 100 µM GTPS for 3 h at 30 °C. N-Tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (9 µL at 0.5 mg/mL) was then added, and this mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Samples were resolved on 11% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue (24). Crystallization. The GTPS,Mg2+ complex of G42VGiR1 was prepared by incubating the protein with 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.05% C12E10, 10 mM MgSO4, and 1.0 mM GTPS for 4 h at 30 °C. The protein was further purified over a Mono-Q 10/10 column as described (19) and exchanged into 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgSO4, and 200 µM GTPS (protein concentration 15-20 mg/mL).

These were serially transferred into stabilization solutions [70% saturated LiSO4, 100 mM BES (pH 7.0), 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgSO4, 50 µM GTPS] containing glycerol in 5% increments to a maximum of 20%. The crystals were mounted in a rayon loop and frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection (14, 25). Crystals of the GDP,Pi-bound form of G42VGiR1 were obtained by exchanging the protein into 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM GDP (protein concentration 10-15 mg/mL). Hanging drops (7 µL) containing a 1:1 ratio of protein and buffer (ammonium phosphate, 2.2-2.5 M, pH 5.5-5.8) were allowed to equilibrate against a reservoir (1.0 mL) of the same buffer. After 7 days at 20 °C, tetragonal rods (0.20 mm × 0.20 mm × 0.80 mm) were obtained. Crystals were mounted directly from the mother liquor for data collection (17). Crystals of the GDP-bound form of G42VGiR1 were obtained by exchanging the protein into 50 mM NaHepes (pH 8.0), 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, and 5 mM GDP (protein concentration 10-15 mg/mL). Tetragonal rods (0.10 mm × 0.10 mm × 0.60 mm) were obtained and frozen as described for the GTPS-bound protein. X-ray Data Collection, Model Building, and Refinement. Data sets (Table 2) for the GTPS,Mg2+ and GDP forms of G42VGiR1 (110 K) were obtained at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) beamline equipped with a 2K CCD detector. Data for the GDP,Pi form of G42VGiR1 (5 °C) were obtained with a Raxis II imaging plate system equipped with a RU300 X-ray generator. The data were integrated and indexed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (26). Crystals of G42VGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) and G42VGiR1(GDP) were isomorphous to corresponding crystals of the wild-type protein. Likewise, crystals of G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi) were isomorphous to crystals of G203AGiR1(GDP,Pi). Hence, the GTPS,Mg2+ and GDP forms of GiR1 and the GDP,Pi form of G203AGiR1 were used as initial phasing models. The calculated phases were combined with the amplitudes for the measured reflections from G42VGiR1. After rigid body and simulated annealing refinement (X-PLOR) (27), SigmaA-weighted (28) simulated annealing omit maps were used to refit regions around the active site.

Each of the three models displays good stereochemistry with at least 90% of the residues in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and with none in the generous or disallowed regions (PROCHECK) (30). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Tables 2 and 3. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with ID codes 1AS0, 1AS2, and 1AS3 for the GTPS, GDP,Pi, and GDP complexes of G42VGiR1. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION P-Loop Mutations in GiR1. Our initial interest was to understand the low kcat for GTP hydrolysis by GzR (0.02 min-1) compared to those of many other GR subunits (1-5 min-1) (21, 31, 32). GzR has a unique TSN sequence in the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) rather than the consensus AGE sequence found in other GR subunits, and this sequence was thus generated in His6GiR1 (Figure 1A). Swapping the Ala41, Gly42, and Glu43 residues in GiR1 for the corresponding Thr, Ser, and Asn reduced the kcat for GTP hydrolysis 17fold. Examination of proteins with single mutations indicated that the change of Gly42 f Ser was responsible for the lower kcat for GTP hydrolysis (Figure 1A). G42VGiR1 was next synthesized to investigate the effect of steric bulk versus a specific effect of the hydroxyl group in G42SGiR1 (Figure 1B). The 30-fold reduction in kcat observed (0.127 min-1) is significant in two respects. First, it suggests that the comparatively low rate of GTP hydrolysis by GzR may be due in part to the steric effects of Ser42. More importantly, the G42VGiR1 mutation mimics effects seen with G12V p21ras. Structural studies of G12V p21ras have suggested that the Val12 side chain in the mutant protein pushes Gly60 and the catalytic Gln61 residues away from the -phosphate of GTP. However, it has been difficult to evaluate this hypothesis because the switch II region that contains Gln61 is poorly ordered in p21ras. In contrast, the analogous Gln204 residue is situated in a well-ordered loop in the GTPS, Mg2+ form of GiR1. The GTPase activity of G12V p21ras cannot be stimulated by GAPs for this low-molecular-weight GTPase (33). We thus examined the interaction of the mutant GiR1 proteins with RGS4, a newly discovered GAP that stimulates the GTPase activity of all members of the GiR subfamily of GR

subunits (22). The GTPase activity of G42VGiR1 was not stimulated by RGS4 (Figure 1C). Interestingly, the GTPase activity of the less bulky G42S mutation was stimulated by RGS4, albeit modestly (2-fold at 400 nM RGS4). This parallels the observation that RGS4 can stimulate (by 6-fold) the GTPase activity of GzR at comparable concentrations (34). Biochemical Comparison of GiR1, G42VGiR1, and G203AGiR1. As mentioned, crystal structures of wild-type GiR1 in its GTPS,Mg2+ (14) and GDP (35) forms have been described, as have the structures of G203AGiR1 in the GDP,Pi and GDP forms (17). We have now crystallized G42VGiR1 in all three states (GTPS,Mg2+, GDP,Pi, and GDP) and have compared the biochemical properties of the wild-type and mutant proteins in detail to facilitate analysis of their structures. The effects of these two mutations in GsR are very similar (36); however, they differ importantly in the context of GiR1. As demonstrated above (Figure 1B), G42VGiR1 has a kcat for GTP hydrolysis 30-fold lower than that of the wild-type protein, indicative of some structural perturbation of this protein's catalytic machinery. In contrast, G203AGiR1 has a normal rate of GTP hydrolysis (2.4 min-1) (Figure 1B). G protein R subunits contain stoichiometric quantities of bound GDP. The rate of binding of GTP or GTPS is

limited by the rate of GDP dissociation. The similar [35S]GTPS binding kinetics of wild-type and mutant proteins (Figure 1D) suggests that the mode of GDP binding for these proteins is essentially identical. GR subunits form a very high affinity complex with GTPS,Mg2+. Both GiR1 and G42VGiR1 bind GTPS quasiirreversibly in the presence of the divalent cation (Figure 1E). By contrast, GTPS dissociates from G203AGiR1 with a rate of 0.019 min-1. Binding of GTPS,Mg2+ to G203AGiR1 is thus somehow altered compared to the other two proteins. These observations are consistent with the fact that G203AGiR1 and its homolog G226AGsR are unable to undergo the GTP-induced conformational change that causes dissociation of GR from G  (36). The steady-state rate for GTP hydrolysis at pH 8.0 (Hepes buffer) is essentially equal to the rate of GDP dissociation (as measured by the rate of GTPS binding) (Table 4). Thus, the steady-state rate of catalysis by all three proteins is limited by product dissociation. The fluorescence of tryptophan residues in GiR1 is enhanced by 30% upon exchange of GDP by GTPS. The fluorescence of the resulting GiR1,GTPS complex is further increased upon binding of Mg2+. This effect was used to

monitor Mg2+ binding to the GTPS forms of the proteins (Figure 1F). The apparent Kd for Mg2+ binding is the same for GiR1 (6 nM) and G42VGiR1 (8 nM), whereas it is modestly diminished with G203AGiR1 (50 nM). This is again consistent with the notion of an altered GTPS,Mg2+ binding mode in G203AGiR1. Upon activation by GTPS,Mg2+ or GDP,AlF4-,Mg2+, GiR1 undergoes a conformational change that renders the protein resistant to proteolysis by trypsin. After rapid cleavage near the N-terminus, a 39-kDa species accumulates (37). By contrast, the inactive GDP-bound form of the protein is rapidly degraded. Both GiR1 and G42VGiR1 are protected from tryptic digestion after incubation with GTPS and Mg2+, whereas G203AGiR1 is not (Figure 2). This further corroborates the notion of a perturbed GTPS,Mg2+ binding mode in G203AGiR1. Interestingly, although G42VGiR1 is protected against trypsin following activation by GTPS, Mg2+, it is not protected by AlF4-,Mg2+. The GiR1,GDP, AlF4-,Mg2+ complex resembles the transition state for GTP hydrolysis (14). As might have been anticipated, this GTPase-deficient mutant appears to bind the transition state analog weakly. Biochemical Characterization of the GiR1,GDP,Pi Complex. Both G42VGiR1 and G203AGiR1 have been crystallized in the GDP,Pi-bound state, while the wild-type protein has not (despite considerable effort). This raises questions about the stability of the GDP,Pi complex and the effect of the mutations on its lifetime and structure. Some have claimed that release of Pi from GR proteins is slower than hydrolysis per se (38); others disagree (39). We attempted to measure binding of 32Pi to GDP,GiR1 (10 µM) by equilibrium dialysis at pH 8, 6, and 5.6 (to mimic crystallization conditions); binding was not detected. The Kd of Pi for GDP,GiR1 is thus significantly higher than 10 µM. The rate of steady-state hydrolysis of GTP by GiR1 and the two mutants studied here is limited by product (GDP) dissociation. Addition of phosphate at concentrations near

or above its Kd for GDP,GiR1 should promote formation of GDP,Pi,GiR1 and reduce the steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis. There was no inhibitory effect of 50 mM sodium phosphate at pH 8; very modest inhibition was observed at pH 5.6 (Table 4). It is thus unlikely that the Kd for Pi in the GDP,Pi,GiR1 complex is substantially less than 50 mM for either the wild-type or mutant proteins. Values of kcat for GTP hydrolysis reported above (Figure 1A,B) were determined by loading GiR1 proteins with [-32P]GTP and initiating hydrolysis by addition of Mg2+. Reactions were quenched by addition of acidic charcoal to denature the protein and adsorb nucleotide. After removal of the charcoal, the amount of 32Pi in the supernatant was quantified. The measurement thus includes both Pi released from the protein after hydrolysis and any Pi released from a GDP,Pi,GiR1 complex by denaturation. Hence, under these conditions, the kcat rate constant measures the rate of -phosphate cleavage. As an alternative, single turnover GTPase reactions were quenched by dilution into cold buffer and rapid (<10 s) adsorption of protein to nitrocellulose membranes to quantify bound radioactive species, presumably both the GTP,GiR1 and the GDP,Pi,GiR1 species. The rate constant for the exponential decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the filter is defined as kpi (Figure 3). Comparison of Figures 1B and 3 indicates that kcat ) kpi and thus, that release of Pi is fast relative to bond cleavage for both wild-type and mutant GiR1 proteins. OVerall Structure of G42VGiR1. The fold of G42VGiR1 is essentially identical to that of GiR1 (Figure 4A). The structure consists of two domains: a p21ras-like guanine nucleotidebinding module, which spans residues 34-56 and residues 188-343, and an R-helical domain spanning residues 63176. The switch regions are those segments that adopt different conformations in the active GTP and inactive GDP forms of GiR1. Switch I (residues 177-187) and switch II (residues 199-219) segments are involved in Mg2+ and -phosphate binding, respectively, as well as in catalysis. Both of these switch regions are present in most members of the p21ras superfamily. Switches III and IV are unique to GR subunits. Switch III (residues 231-242) is a -R turn that forms ionic contacts with switch II. Switch IV (residues

The intermediate GDP,Pi state more closely resembles the GTPS,Mg2+ structure in that both have disordered N- and C-termini as well as similar conformations of switch I. The conformation of switch II, however, is entirely different in the GTPS,Mg2+ and GDP,Pi structures, whereas it is disordered in the GDP structure. The switch III segment is poorly ordered in all three complexes. Interestingly, the switch IV region of the GDP,Pi-bound protein, although not well ordered (B/Bav ) 1.8),2 more closely resembles that observed when GDP is bound, even though the GDP,Pi-bound protein does not participate in homopolymeric interactions in the crystal lattice. All of the contacts between the protein and the guanine nucleotide monophosphate moiety are similar in the three nucleotide-binding states of G42VGiR1. In particular, noncovalent interactions of the R- and -phosphates with residues 40-44 in the P-loop are conserved in the three structures and are identical to those seen in GiR1. However, during the course of hydrolysis, when the enzyme passes from the GTPS,Mg2+ to the GDP,Pi and eventually the GDP state, switch I and most notably switch II adopt different conformations to accommodate the bound ligands. Structure of G42VGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+). The active site of wild-type GiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) is shown in Figure 5A. A well-ordered water molecule is held in place by hydrogen bonds with the Thr181 main chain carbonyl and with the -phosphate oxygen. This water molecule is located 3.9 Å away from the -phosphorus and is positioned for in-line attack on the -phosphate. A Mg2+ cation with an octahedral coordination sphere is also present. The terminal oxygens of both the - and -phosphates of GTPS serve as ligands to this cation. Coordination of the -phosphate by Mg2+ should increase the electrophilicity of the GTP molecule for nucleophilic attack by the water. Furthermore, coordination of the -phosphate should make the GDP molecule a better leaving group during -phosphate bond cleavage. Two additional ligands are the side chains of Thr181 and Ser47. The remaining two axial coordination sites are occupied by water molecules. Also shown in Figure 5A is the switch II region, which spans a loop from Phe199 to Gly203 followed by an R-helical region from Gln204 to Cys214. The single contact between the GTPS,Mg2+ ligand and switch II is the hydrogen bond between the Gly203 backbone nitrogen and the -phosphate oxygen. In addition, residues Glu236, Asp237, and Glu245 in switch III form ionic contacts with residues Arg205 and Arg208 in switch II. As demonstrated previously, Arg178 and Gln204 are critical participants in GTP hydrolysis but not GTP binding. These residues make no direct contacts with the GTPS ligand or with other residues in the GiR1 protein. Nonetheless, they are positioned close to the - and -phosphates. Slight movements of their side chains enable these residues to bind the transition state species and thereby catalyze GTP hydrolysis. The structure of GiR1 with GDP,AlF4-,Mg2+ as the bound ligand (Figure 6) closely approximates that of GiR1(GTPS, Mg2+) but with important differences. The -phosphate of
2B av is the average B factor for all non-hydrogen atoms in the molecule. The B/Bav normalization facilitates comparison of thermal parameters of equivalent atoms in different crystal complexes.

111-119) is a region that might be involved in oligomerization of GiR1(GDP) (35). The structures of GiR1 and G42VGiR1 in the GTPS,Mg2+ form are very similar; they can be superimposed with a rms (root mean square) deviation of 0.39 Å at CR positions. Residues at the N-terminus (1-31) and C-terminus (345354) are disordered in both structures. Similarly, the structures of G42VGiR1 and G203AGiR1 in the GDP,Pi form can be superimposed with a rms deviation of 0.23 Å at CR positions. Like the structures of the GTPS,Mg2+ complex, residues at the N-terminus (1-31) and C-terminus (347354) are also disordered in the GDP,Pi complex. Finally, the structures of GiR1 and G42VGiR1 in the GDP form can be superimposed with a rms deviation of 0.24 Å at CR positions. Unlike the GTPS,Mg2+ and GDP,Pi structures, however, the N-termini and C-termini form an ordered microdomain that is involved in quaternary interactions in crystals of GiR1(GDP). Figure 4B depicts a superposition of the CR traces of the G42VGiR1 structures in the GTPS,Mg2+, GDP,Pi, and GDP forms. The overall structures of these three complexes are similar.

(B) Ribbon diagram of the G42VGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) active site. Note that the side chain of Arg205 is disordered and is modeled in an extended conformation.

GTPS is replaced with an AlF4- moiety in which the octahedral coordination sphere of the Al3+ cation has four fluoride ligands in an equatorial plane. The remaining two axial coordination sites are occupied by a GDP -phosphate oxygen and a water molecule. Furthermore, the Arg178 and Gln204 side chains have moved. The Arg178 side chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the fluoride ligands on Al3+, and the Gln204 side chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance of both the nucleophilic water (or possibly hydroxide) (40) and a fluoride ligand on Al3+. This species is reminiscent of the putative pentacoordinate trigonal bypyramidal transition state (or perhaps high energy intermediate) postulated to occur during -phosphate bond cleavage.

Hence, the complex is a transition state analog for GTP hydrolysis. Model building using the active site of GiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) suggested that substitution of Gly42 in the P-loop with Val would result in significant steric interaction between the Val42 -methyl groups and the main and side chain atoms of Gln204 and this would force accommodation in the P-loop, switch II, or both. The structure of this mutant in the activated GTPS,Mg2+ state is shown in Figure 5B. The conformation of the P-loop is unaltered. However, the steric bulk of the valine side chain has forced the peptide planes about residues 203-206 to rotate by as much as 30°. This, in turn, has pushed the Gln204 side chain out of the active site. Notably, the amide side chain of Gln204 is now well within hydrogenbonding distance of Ser206 and is more ordered (B/Bav ) 1.4 compared to 1.9 in the wild-type protein). On the other hand, the hydrogen bond between the Gly203 backbone nitrogen and the -phosphate oxygen is unaltered. These perturbations offer a clear rationale for the diminished GTPase activity of G42VGiR1. Interestingly, no electron density is visible for the side chain of Arg205 or for portions of switch III. Evidently, rotation of Arg205 has ruptured ionic contacts between its side chain and those of Asp237 and Glu245 in switch III as well as the hydrogen bond between the Arg205 backbone nitrogen and the Glu239 side chain carboxylate. Rotation about the Arg205 main chain has thus severed important contacts between switch II and switch III. This, in turn, has resulted in a highly mobile switch III region in the structure of the activated mutant protein. The P-loop region forms hydrogen bonds with the R- and -phosphates of the guanine nucleotide, whereas the Gly203 backbone amide is hydrogen bonded to the -phosphate. Since these contacts are all unaltered in G42VGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+), it is not surprising that both wild-type and G42VGiR1 bind GTPS,Mg2+ irreversibly (Figure 1E) and are protected from tryptic proteolysis when so activated (Figure 2). Furthermore, the conformation of the Ser47 and Thr181 ligands in the Mg2+ coordination sphere are unaltered by the G42V mutation, consistent with the strong affinity of both the wild-type and mutant proteins for Mg2+ (Figure 1F). Although the structure of G203AGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) has not been elucidated, replacement of a hydrogen atom by a methyl

GTPase-Deficient G Protein Mutants

Biochemistry, Vol. 36, No. 50, 1997 15667 Protonation of these ligands would also reduce their ability to coordinate Mg2+, and this may account for the absence of a Mg2+ cation in the active site. The most significant conformational changes are observed in the switch II R-helix. In both wild-type and G42VGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+), the switch II region spans a loop from Phe199 to Gly203, followed by an R-helical segment from Gln204 to Cys214. In the GDP,Pi intermediate, two helical segments are evident. One R-helix spans residues Gly203 to Lys207 and the other spans residues Lys209 to Phe215. Arg208 forms a kink between these two R-helices. The formation of these two helices has several important consequences. First, this conformational change has, in effect, pulled the switch II region away from the active site, creating a binding site for Pi. The hydrogen bond between the Gly203 main chain nitrogen and the free Pi oxygen atom is maintained by the altered conformation of switch II. Furthermore, the dipole of the first helical segment is directed toward the phosphate ion. The second helical segment has also rotated by 180° such that Trp211 (responsible for GTPS,Mg2+-induced fluorescence) moves from a hydrophobic interface with the R3 helix in the GTPS,Mg2+ structure to a more solventexposed site in the GDP,Pi complex. Furthermore, this R-helix was buried against the R3 helix and sitting between the 1 and 3 strands in the GTPS,Mg2+ structure; in the GDP,Pi complex it has moved toward the R3 helix, placing it just above the 1 strand (not shown). Finally, these rearrangements have pushed the catalytic Gln204 residue out of the active site into a highly mobile, solvent-exposed position. The conformational changes in switch II move the Arg205 and Arg208 side chains into more solvent-exposed regions, away from any possible contacts with switch III. Since these contacts may account for the rigidity of switch III in the GiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) structure, their loss in the G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi) complex results in a switch III region that is partially disordered and pushed away from the active site. The structures of G203AGiR1(GDP,Pi) and G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi) are essentially the same, despite their disparate biochemical properties. Although both mutations perturb the active site, the observation of identical GDP,Pi-bound species suggests that the structures represent a conformation that occurs only transiently in the wild-type protein but is somehow stabilized by each of the two mutations. The active sites of the G203A and G42V mutants are shown in greater detail in Figure 8 to suggest a common mechanism for stabilization of the GDP,Pi intermediate. For G203AGiR1(GDP,Pi), a van der Waals contact between the methyl group of Ala203 and the main chain nitrogen of Gly42 may be sufficient to push the amino terminus of switch II out of the Pi binding pocket. Analogously, the G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi) structure reveals a potential contact between the Val42 side chain and the Gly203 main chain. Although the distance is large for a van der Waals interaction, one must consider that the amino terminus of switch II is conformationally constrained. Hence, both the G42V and G203A mutations may force the switch II peptide segment into one of a limited number of possible conformations that permits creation of a phosphate-binding pocket. In the wild-type structure, there are no potential van der Waals contacts between the P-loop and the N-terminus of switch II; the switch II peptide segment is free to adopt conformations that would exclude

group on Gly203 in the native structure would cause a steric clash between the Ala203 side chain and the Gly42 main chain (the glycine  and  angles fall within allowed regions for non-glycine side chains). This should result in a conformational change in the P-loop or, more likely, in the contact between Ala203 and the -phosphate. This may account for the diminished affinity of G203AGiR1 for GTPS,Mg2+ (Figure 1E), as well as its susceptibility toward trypsinolysis even when GTPS,Mg2+ is bound (Figure 2). Furthermore, the altered nucleotide binding mode of G203AGiR1 might also account for the modestly diminished affinity of the protein for Mg2+ (Figure 1F). Structure of G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi). Hydrolysis of GTP by GiR1 results in formation of a transient, GDP,Pi-bound intermediate. The structure of a complex between G42VGiR1 and GDP,Pi is shown in Figure 7. The once terminal -phosphorus atom has moved 2.2 Å away from the GDP -phosphorus. The structure of G42VGiR1(GTPS,Mg2+) indicates that translation of the -phosphate by this distance would cause steric clashes with main chain atoms of switch I (Thr181) and switch II (Gly202 and Gly203). In fact, the protein has undergone substantial conformational changes in these regions to accommodate the bound phosphate ion in the GDP,Pi complex. Although the conformation of the switch I main chain is similar to that in the GTPS,Mg2+ complex, residues 178183 have moved approximately 1.0 Å away from the active site to alleviate the steric contact with the phosphate ion. Furthermore, the Thr181 side chain has rotated 90° to form a hydrogen bond with an oxygen of Pi. The side chain of Lys180 is reoriented from a solvent-exposed position in the GTPS,Mg2+ complex to one in which the amine moiety forms a hydrogen bond with a Pi oxygen atom. Arg178 also moves from a poorly ordered, solvent-exposed position (B/Bav ) 1.3) to one in which it forms strong ionic contacts (B/Bav ) 0.70) with both the GDP -phosphate and the Pi oxygen atoms. The Mg2+ binding site also appears to be dismantled in the GDP,Pi complex. In part, this results from the reorientation of the Thr181 side chain, a ligand for the Mg2+ cation. In addition, under the conditions of crystallization (pH 5.55.8), the GDP -phosphate and the free phosphate ions are each expected to carry a single negative charge. This would reduce electrostatic repulsion between the GDP and Pi anions, with consequent stabilization of the GDP,Pi complex; this intermediate might be considerably less stable at neutral pH.

Pi from the active site, thereby limiting the stability of the GiR1(GDP,Pi) complex. An alternative explanation for the stability of the GDP,Pi intermediate in these mutants rests on the observation that the G12V and G60A mutations in p21ras (G60 is analogous to G203 in GiR1) alter the pKa of the GTP -phosphate (41). Conceivably, the Ala203 or Val42 side chains in the GiR1 mutants may alter the pKa's of the GDP -phosphate and the free Pi such that their resultant protonation states increase the stability of the GDP,Pi entity. Nevertheless, it must be stressed that the GDP,Pi intermediate is not stable in either the wild-type or the mutant proteins (Table 4) nor is release of Pi rate limiting (Figure 3). Additional factors that may facilitate the crystallization of this species are the high phosphate concentrations utilized (2 M), driving the equilibrium toward the GDP,Pi species, and the acidic pH (5.5-5.8), which reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the GDP -phosphate and Pi. Structure of G42VGiR1(GDP). Upon release of phosphate from the G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi) intermediate, the protein assumes its inactive GDP-bound state (Figure 9). As a result of the loss of contacts with Pi, switch I moves away from the active site by 2.0 Å and the side chains of Lys180 and Thr181 become disordered. Only the Arg178 side chain of switch I forms a contact with the R- and -phosphates of GDP. These conformational changes also dismantle the Mg2+-binding site.

In contrast to p21ras, GDP,GiR proteins have low affinity for Mg2+. Dissociation of Pi ruptures the hydrogen bond between the main chain nitrogen of Gly203 and the free phosphate ion oxygen, thereby removing the only contact between switch II and the nucleotide. Switch II thus assumes a highly mobile conformation with no discernible electron density for residues 205-215. This collapse of switch II upon inactivation is characteristic of several other GTPases, including p21ras. Finally, switch III also becomes disordered as a result of the loss of stabilizing contacts with switch II. No electron density is visible for residues 202-217 in the switch II region of GiR1(GDP). However, electron density is clearly visible for the main chain atoms of residues 202204 in G42VGiR1(GDP). The conformation adopted by these three residues closely resembles that of the amino terminus of the first helical segment of the GDP,Pi complex. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism by which the G203A and G42V mutations stabilize the GDP,Pi intermediate, since this model also predicts that the Val42 or Ala203 side chains of these mutants may also limit the conformational flexibility of switch II in the inactive GDP-bound protein. This also suggests that the switch II conformation seen in the GDP,Pi complex is not solely the result of low pH, since crystals of G42VGiR1(GDP) were obtained at neutral pH. Apart from this small difference, the inactive GDP complex is identical in wild-type and mutant proteins. These similarities account for their similar rates of GDP dissociation (Figure 1D). Conclusions. Both G42VGiR1 and G12V p21ras have diminished rates of GTP hydrolysis, and neither rate can be increased by appropriate GAPs. Unlike p21ras, the structure of the well-ordered switch II region of G42VGiR1(GTPS, Mg2+) provides a clear rationale for the diminished kcat for GTP hydrolysis. The bulk of the Val42 side chain forces the side chain of Gln204 into a catalytically incompetent conformation. These findings substantiate the original models for p21ras proposed by Wittinghofer (12) and Prive ´ (11). Similarly, the bulk of the unique Ser42 residue in GzR may also account for the comparatively slow rate of GTP hydrolysis that characterizes this GR subunit. Interestingly, RGS4 can stimulate the GTPase activity of G42SGiR1, albeit to a modest level, perhaps because of the smaller bulk of the Ser residue. This parallels the observation that RGS4 can stimulate the GTPase activity of GzR.

GTPase-Deficient G Protein Mutants Crystallographic studies with G42VGiR1 demonstrate that the switch I and the switch II regions of the protein undergo significant conformational changes upon hydrolysis of GTP to a transient GDP,Pi intermediate. It must be emphasized that most of these changes center around the switch II region. Eventual release of Pi from G42VGiR1(GDP,Pi) generates G42VGiR1(GDP). During this second transition along the reaction coordinate, the switch I segment moves further from the active site and switch II adopts a highly mobile conformation. Although these studies were performed with a mutant G42VGiR1 subunit with an altered GTPS,Mg2+ binding site, we believe that the results are not artifacts of the mutation for the following reasons: (1) The G42V mutation in GiR1 impairs catalytic activity but does not affect affinity for nucleotide. The reverse is true of the G203AGiR1 mutant. Thus, even though G42VGiR1 and G203AGiR1 have very different biochemical properties, they possess essentially identical structures when bound to GDP,Pi and GDP. (2) The affinity of both wild-type and mutant proteins for Pi in the GDP,Pi complex is low, and release of Pi is significantly faster than cleavage of the -phosphate. Thus, we believe that the structure of the GDP,Pi-bound intermediate in G42VGiR1 and G203AGiR1 represents a conformation that occurs transiently in the wild-type protein; it is somehow stabilized by these mutations, perhaps by limiting the conformational flexibility of switch II. The only other study that closely resembles our own is the structural characterization of the ATPase fragment of the bovine 70-kDa heat shock protein in its ATP- and ADP,Pibound forms. Here, McKay and co-workers (42) have seen active site rearrangements that resemble those described above. Like GiR1, this enzyme also catalyzes slow -phosphate cleavage (<1 min-1). It is quite possible that in both the ATPase fragment and the GiR1 subunit, extensive reorganization of the active site contributes to the energy barrier during -phosphate cleavage and thereby accounts, in part, for the poor catalytic efficiency of these enzymes.
