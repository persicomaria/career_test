ABSTRACT Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyzes the interconversion between dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in the glycolysis­gluconeogenesis metabolism pathway. The Helicobacter pylori TIM gene (HpTIM) was cloned, and HpTIM was expressed and purified. The enzymatic activity of HpTIM for the substrate GAP was determined (Km 5 3.46 6 0.23 mM and kcat 5 8.8 3 104 min21). The crystal structure of HpTIM was determined by molec° ular replacement at 2.3 A resolution. The overall structure of HpTIM was (b/a)b(b/ a)6, which resembles the common TIM barrel fold, (b/a)8; however, a helix is missing after the second b-strand. The conformation of loop 6 and binding of phosphate ion suggest that the determined structure of HpTIM was in the ``closed'' state. A highly conserved ArgAsp salt bridge in the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif of most TIMs is absent in HpTIM because the sequence of this motif is ``211SVDG214.'' To determine the significance of this salt bridge to HpTIM, four mutants, including K183S, K183A, D213Q, and D213A, were constructed and characterized. The results suggest that this conserved salt bridge is not essential for the enzymatic activity of HpTIM; however, it might contribute to the conformational stability of HpTIM.

INTRODUCTION Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative bacterium, is well suited for colonization in the human stomach and is present in over 50% of the human population worldwide.1 The colonization of H. pylori in stomach mucosa induces chronic gastric inflammation and progresses to a variety of diseases, including superficial gastritis, peptic ulcers, stomach cancer, and mucosal-associated lymphoma.2 H. pylori is a serious human pathogen for which the complete genome of strain 26695 has been reported.3,4 H. pylori strain 26695 has a circular genome of 1,667,867 base pairs and 1590 predicted coding sequences.4 The metabolic pathway study of the whole genome for H. pylori proposed that glucose is the only carbohydrate source for H. pylori and the major resource for substrate-level phosphorylation.4 Two other carbon sources in H. pylori, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate shunt, are incomplete or absent, respectively.4 The glycolysis­gluconeogenesis pathway constitutes the foundation for energy production and glucose metabolism is the initiation point of many biosynthetic pathways for most organisms including H. pylori. All of these facts indicate the importance of the glycolysis­gluconeogenesis pathway in H. pylori. Glycolysis pathway converts glucose to pyruvate with the generation of ATP and provides part of the energy utilized by most organisms. Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM, D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ketol-isomerase, EC 5.3.1.1) catalyzes the interconversion reaction of the glycolytic pathway by means of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), two ketose­aldose isomers.5,6 TIM is a ubiquitous and conserved enzyme from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and is also called ``the evolutionarily perfect enzyme''.7 Its importance can also be inferred from the fact that humans deficient in TIM suffer from hemolytic anemia and neuromuscular dysfunction.8,9 TIM orthologs from most organisms form homodimers; TIMs from Pyrococcus woesei10 and Methanothermus fervidus11 are homotetramers, whereas the TIM from Thermotoga maritima12 exists as a tetrameric fusion protein with phosphoglycerate kinase. Several crystal structures of TIMs from different species have been determined, such as those of chicken,13 yeast,14 and trypanosome.15 A typical and well known structural folding for TIM is the

Triosephosphate Isomerase from H. pylori

``TIM barrel,'' which comprises eight repeats of strandturn-helix-turn units, forming a parallel eight-stranded b-barrel surrounded by eight a-helices on the outside of the molecule. The active site is situated at the C-terminal end of eight loops (loops 1­8) on the b-strands of the barrel. Upon ligand binding, loop 6 shifts to the active site to shield it from solvent and create a closed conformation. This conformation is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between loop 6 and one of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group ligands.16 Three conserved catalytic residues, Lys, His, and Glu, are located in the loops 1, 4, and 6, respectively. HpTIM (Helicobacter pylori triosephosphate isomerase) is the TIM enzyme involved in the glycolysis­gluconeogenesis pathway in H. pylori strain 26695. We now report the crystal structure of HpTIM determined by X-ray dif° fraction analysis at 2.3 A. We describe the structural characteristics of HpTIM and the kinetics of HpTIM activity by coupled-enzyme assay.17 Additionally, four mutant proteins of HpTIM, K183S, K183A, D213Q, and D213A, were isolated and analyzed.

was purified on a Ni-NTA affinity column. HpTIM was eluted with an elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 150 mM imidazole). The eluted protein was further purified by FPLC using a Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 prep-grade column (Amersham Bioscience) preequilibrated with a running buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl).
Activity assay

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Construction of a plasmid encoding the HpTIM gene

The full-length HpTIM gene was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA of H. pylori 26695 [ATCC 700392D] using the forward primer, 50 -GCGGATCCAT GACAAAAATTGCCATGGC-30 and reverse primer, 50 GCGTCGACTTATAAAAATGAAATGATTG-30 containing BamHI and SalI sites (underlined) with pfu DNA polymerase. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pQE30 to generate the His6-tagged HpTIM construct. The 6x-His tag was incorporated into the protein at the N-terminus.
Protein expression and purification

The isomerization activity of HpTIM was determined by the coupled-enzyme assay.17 The substrate, GAP, was isomerized to DHAP by HpTIM, and the DHAP product, was then immediately oxidized to glycerol-3-phosphate by a-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase using NADH as a cofactor. The amount of DHAP production equaled to the amount of NADH consumption; thus, the isomerization activity of HpTIM was determined by the decrease of NADH. The reactant, 1 mM GAP (SIGMA) and 5 ng/mL HpTIM were used in the isomerization reaction. Additionally, 5 lg/mL a-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and 0.22 mM NADH were used in the oxidation­reduction reaction. The reaction buffer consisted of 100 mM triethanolamine (SIGMA), pH 7.5, and 10 mM EDTA in a total volume of 1 mL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of HpTIM, and the decrease of NADH was monitored at 340 nm on a HITACHI U-3210 spectrophotometer after a 10-min incubation at 258C. Michaelis constants, Km, Vmax, and kcat, for the isomerization activity of HpTIM were calculated by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software).
Crystallization and data collection

HpTIM was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain SG13009. The bacterial culture was grown overnight at 378C in LB broth supplemented with 100 lg/mL ampicillin and 25 lg/mL kanamycin. The overnight culture was added to 1-L fresh LB media at a 1:50 ratio, and the culture was incubated at 378C and 200 rpm until an OD595 of 0.5­0.7 was reached. The recombinant protein was induced with isopropyl-b-D thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.3 mM at 208C for 20 h. A bacterial pellet was obtained after centrifugation (4000g) and resuspended in 40 mL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). The resuspended pellet was homogenized with a high-pressure homogenizer (EmulsiFlex-C5, Avestin). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000g at 48C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, and HpTIM

Crystallization trials of HpTIM were carried out by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Protein solution (1 lL) was mixed with 1-lL reservoir solution [25­28% PEG3350, 0.2M KH2PO4, and 0.1M cyclohexylpropanoylN-hydroxyethylglucamide (C-HEGA-9)] and equilibrated against a 500-lL reservoir solution in Linbro plates. Initial crystallization conditions were obtained using crystal screen kits (Hampton) and then further optimized to obtain diffraction quality crystals. The concentration of HpTIM was $45 mg/mL in a buffer of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl. The HpTIM crystals were grown by sitting drop vapor diffusion. X-ray diffraction data were collected on a Rigaku IV11 image plate detec° tor using Cu Ka (1.5418 A) radiation from a Rigaku RU-H3R generator at 40 keV and 80 mA. The HpTIM ° crystal diffracted to 2.3 A. Crystals were flash-cooled to 100 K by a nitrogen gas stream during the data collection. All data sets were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the DENZO and SCALEPACK software.18 The HpTIM crystal belongs to the primitive orthorhombic, P21212 space group with unit cell parameters: a 5 128.2

Structure determination and refinement

To date, TIM crystal structures from 14 species have been solved, and the regular (b/a)8 TIM barrel is well conserved in the structures. To determine the most appropriate model for molecular replacement, sequence alignment by CLUSTALW20 was performed using TIMs structures in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/ pdb/). The Caenorhabditis elegans TIM (PDB: 1MO021) was applied as a search model, and the program MOLREP22 was used for the molecular replacement phase determination. Rotation and translation solutions were obtained for HpTIM with the correlation coefficient of 21.5% and a R-factor of 56.6%. Structural model building was carried out using the XtalView/Xfit.23 Structural refinement was calculated by the program CNS.24 Simulated annealing omit maps were used to reduce the model bias and to determine the positions of the detergent molecule, C-HEGA-9, and phosphate ion. The refined structural model of HpTIM dimer contained 3730 protein atoms and 312 water molecules, with an R° factor of 18.9% and an Rfree of 23.9% at 2.3 A (Table I). The structural geometry was verified by a Ramachandran plot generated using program PROCHECK.25 The atomic coordinates of HpTIM were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID 2jgq).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
HpTIM expression, purification, and characterization

Isomerization activity of HpTIM

The HpTIM gene consists of 705 bp with a predicted protein sequence of 234 amino acid residues. HpTIM was constructed as a His-tag fusion protein and expressed in the E. coli SG13009 strain. The molecular weight of HpTIM monomer was determined as 28,108 Da by mass spectrometry. The molecular weight of HpTIM in solution was calculated to be 56 kDa by gel filtration (Superdex 200) using the marker proteins [lysozyme (15 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa)] (data not shown). In addition, the sedimentation coefficient (S) of HpTIM was determined to be ``3.58 Æ 0.04'' by sedimentation velocity experiments using the Beckman XL-A Optima analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and a Ti-60a titanium rotor at 45,000 rpm. These data suggest that HpTIM oliogomerizes as a dimer in solution and also functions as a dimer.

The isomerization activity of HpTIM was determined by a coupled-enzyme assay17 in the direction of GAP to DHAP by measuring the decrease of NADH at 340 nm. Michaelis constants, Km and kcat, for HpTIM were calculated to be 3.46 Æ 0.23 mM and 8.8 3 104 min21, respectively, (Table II) by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph software. When compared with other TIMs, HpTIM exhibits weaker Km and kcat values. For example, the Km of HpTIM is $10-fold higher than that of TbTIM (Trypanosoma brucei brucei) (0.25 mM)26 and the kcat of HpTIM is approximately fourfold lower than that of TbTIM (3.6 3 105 min21). Consequently, HpTIM reveals weaker substrate binding affinity and lower catalytic efficiency.

Sequence alignment of HpTIM with 14 TIM family proteins was generated by CLUSTALW20 (Fig. 1). HpTIM shares 24­30% sequence identity with these TIMs. Three conserved key residues, ``Lys-His-Glu,'' that

of the location of L6 as well as the phosphate ion [Fig. 2(c)]. The substrate binding pocket of HpTIM is created by three key residues, Lys10, His90, and Glu159, in a similar conformation to that of other TIMs [Fig. 2(b)]. These three residues are located in loops L1, L4, and L6 [Fig. 2(b)], respectively, and their conformations are like that of other TIMs. Meanwhile, a phosphate ion is positioned in the active site surrounded by residues Lys10, Gly165, Ser197, Gly218, and Ser219. A ``C-HEGA-9'' molecule is apparent in the Fo 2 Fc omit map at 2r and lies in the surface area around loops L6, L7, and L8. CHEGA-9 only exists in one monomer of the dimer, and it makes one hydrogen bond with Ser169 O (loop a8a9) and hydrophobic interactions with Arg129 (a6), Trp162 (a8), and Asp174 (a9). Although C-HEGA-9 is close to the important L6 region, it does not affect the orientation of L6.

are involved in the isomerization activity of TIM families21,28 also exist in HpTIM as ``Lys10-His90Glu159.'' HpTIM has the same conserved sequence, ``159EPIWAIGTKK168,'' found in most TIMs, ``159EP[I/V/ L]WAIGTG[K/R/L]168,'' except that Lys167 replaces the conserved glycine. Noticeably, there is a deletion of eight residues between Pro191 and Leu192. The conserved crucial motif ``DX(D/N)G'' found in most TIMs is ``211SVDG214'' in HpTIM, and the highly conserved first ``aspartic acid'' is substituted by a ``serine.''
Overall structure

Crystal structures of the HpTIM monomers [Fig. 2(a)] ° were determined at 2.3 A, and they contain one phosphate ion and one detergent molecule, C-HEGA-9, which was used for crystallization. The overall folding of HpTIM, ``(b/a)b(b/a)6,'' is similar to other TIM barrel folding, ``(b/a)8,'' except for the absence of the second ahelix. In the following discussion, b-strands and a-helices in HpTIM are named from bA to bG and a1 to a12, respectively, and the loops from b strand to a helix were represented as L1 to L8. The overall structures of two monomers of a dimer were similar with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) on Ca atomic positions at 0.31 ° A [Fig. 2(b)]. There are two typical conformations in TIMs, ``open'' and ``closed.'' When TIM is in a unliganded state, L6 (loop bF-a8) remains in an ``open'' conformation, as shown in the 1YPI (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)14 and 3TIM (Trypanosoma brucei brucei)15 structures of TIM. When substrate binds to TIMs, L6 folds over to clamp the substrate and yielding a ``closed'' conformation, as evidenced by the 1AG1 (Trypanosoma brucei brucei)32 and 1MO0 (Caenorhabditis elegans)21 TIM structures. HpTIM is recognized as a ``closed'' conformation because

Dimer is the biological oligomer for TIMs and each monomer has its own active site.33 The enzyme activity and protein stability of HsTIM (Homo sapiens) are reduced when Met14 (in L1) or Arg98 (in L4) are substituted individually or together with Gln.34 In HsTIM, both M14Q and R98Q mutants exist as a mixture of dimer and monomer, but M14Q/R198Q double mutant is completely monomeric. The enzyme activity of M14Q mutant is similar to that of wild type HsTIM, but both R98Q and M14Q/R98Q mutants are inactive.34 Evidently, the dimerization plays an important role in the isomerization of TIMs. HpTIM also was a dimer in both the solution and crystal states. The quaternary structure of dimeric HpTIM is shown in Figure 2(b). The dimer interface is formed mainly by loops L1, L2, L3, and L4. The protruding loop L3 of one subunit docks into a deep pocket of the other subunit formed by loops L1 and L4 in which two key residues, Lys10 and His90, respectively, are located. The dimer interface of one subunit is near the catalytic site of the other subunit. In addition, helices 3 and 5 contribute a number of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions that dominate the dimerization. Only two interactions were generated by bstrands, bA and bD. These HpTIM dimer interactions are mostly similar to those of other TIMs and the buried ° surface area in the interface was calculated to be 3224 A2 24 by CNS.
Binding pocket of HpTIM

The substrate binding pocket of HpTIM is known to be formed by three key residues, Lys10, His90, and Glu159. Since there is no functional substrate in the HpTIM crystal, these residues reorient in our structure to stabilize the partially empty binding pocket. Lys10 forms hydrogen bonds with Asn8, Gln59, and Glu92,

and, in particular, the Lys10 NZ forms a strong interac° tion (2.53 A) with Glu92 OE2. The His90 residue forms hydrogen bonds with Glu92, Arg93, Arg94, and Glu159. A unique interaction between His90 NE2 and Glu159 OE2 occurs in HpTIM. In addition, the main chain of Glu159 interacts with two hydrophobic residues, Ile122 and Ile161. These interactions also have been observed in the TbTIM/phosphate ion complex as well as in most TIM structures. From the direct and strong interaction networks, created by the essential residues, Lys10, His90, and Glu159, we conclude that the HpTIM binding pocket has a very stable conformation even without a substrate, such as, 3TIM15 and 1YP1.14 Although there is no substrate in the HpTIM crystal, the phosphate ion acts as a competitive inhibitor and occupies the substrate binding pocket. The phosphate ion was determined by the Fo 2 Fc difference map at 3r [Fig. 2(d)]. Interactions between proteins and phosphate ions are mainly categorized into two classes, proteinphosphate ion direct interaction and water-mediated hydrogen bonds. For the protein-phosphate ion direct hydrogen bonds [Fig. 2(e)], the phosphate ion is locked in the binding pocket by Lys10, Gly165, Ser197, Gly218, and Ser219, which are highly conserved residues, except Ser219 is glycine in most TIMs. The hydrogen bond between Gly165N (located in L6) and the O4 of the phosphate ion is the characteristic interaction that has been observed in other TIMs in the closed conformation.35,36 However, the hydrogen bond between Lys10 NZ and the O3 of phosphate ion is the only interaction observed in the HpTIM phosphate ion complex. Moreover, several water molecules, WAT41, WAT64, WAT141, WAT147, and WAT161 are involved in water-mediated protein-phosphate ion hydrogen bonds through residues, 165­166 (loop a8-a9), 196­198 (L7), 216 (bH), and 220 (a11) [Fig. 2(f)]. These residues are all highly conserved in most TIMs, except Val198 is alanine in S. cerevisiae and isoleucine in T. maritima. These water molecules all have low temperature factors. Both WAT147 and WAT161 form hydrogen bonds with key residues Lys10 and Glu159, respectively. These interactions between the phosphate ion and HpTIM are conserved in other TIMs. Thus, we conclude that the binding of phosphate ion in the HpTIM phosphate ion complex is highly consistent with other TIMs phosphate ion complexes because TIMs contain a very compact and rigid binding pocket environment. Meanwhile the phosphate ion works as a potent inhibitor for HpTIM.
Structure comparisons

3(a)]. There are several sequence differences in the loop a2-bB (residues 29­36) among TIMs [I, Fig. 3(a)]. HpTIM folds as a loop in L2 (residues 41­54) instead of forming a helix as in other TIMs [II, Fig. 3(a)]. HpTIM reveals shorter loops in the loop a7-bF (residues 145­ 153) with a deletion of three residues [III, Fig. 3(a)] and in the loop a9-bG (residues 185­191) with a deletion of eight residues [IV, Fig. 3(a)]. TbTIM (PDB: 1AG1) was solved as a phosphate-containing complex similar to HpTIM. The ribose 5-phos22 phate inhibitor was hydrolyzed to HPO4 and bound 32 The superposition of into the active site of the TbTIM. the HpTIM and TbTIM complexes is shown in Figure 3(b). Consequently, the protein-phosphate ion interactions in both complexes are very similar, having an ° RMSD of 0.3 A for the two phosphate ions. Five water molecules (WAT41, WAT64, WAT141, WAT147, and WAT161) involved in water-mediated protein-phosphate interactions in the HpTIM phosphate ion complex also have been observed in the TbTIM phosphate ion complex. In particular, WAT161 is in the identical position with the corresponding water molecule for the TbTIM phosphate ion complex [Fig. 3(b)]. Two water molecules, WAT147 and WAT161, form hydrogen bonds with the key residues, Lys10 and Glu159, in the HpTIM phosphate ion complex. A similar situation occurred in the TbTIM phosphate ion complex, the corresponding water molecules interact with residues Lys13 and Glu167. Therefore, we suggest that WAT147 and WAT161 are the functional water molecules in the HpTIM and TbTIM phosphate ion complexes.
Salt bridge in the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif

Superposition of seven ``closed'' TIMs structures is shown in Figure 3(a). These proteins share the similar TIM barrel fold with an RMSD of Ca atoms ranging ° from 1.11 to 1.31 A. Structural differences are observed in loops a2-bB, L2, a7-bF, and the a9-bG regions [Fig.

An important Arg-Asp salt bridge is absolutely conserved in about 60 TIM sequences (Fig. 1).26 Functional and bioinformatics studies have suggested that this salt bridge is essential for the folding, stability, and function of TIMs.37­43 The arginine residue in the salt bridge is located in a unique helix of a connecting network, and aspartic acid is the first residue of the conserved motif ``DX(D/N)G''.26 Although this salt bridge is distant from both the active site and the dimer interface, it is located at the extremities of dimer and joins the C-terminal region to the rest of the protein via an extensive interaction. However, the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif in HpTIM has been replaced with the ``211SVDG214'' sequence (in loop a10-bH), and thus the highly conserved Arg-Asp salt bridge does not exist [Fig. 4(b)]. In HpTIM, the corresponding residues of the highly conserved Arg-Asp salt bridge are Lys183 and Ser211, respectively. The Lys183 makes a hydrogen bond with Asp213 and builds an alternate Lys183-Asp213 salt bridge in HpTIM rather than interacting with Ser211. The detailed interactions of the tethering hydrogen bond network surrounding the ``211SVDG214'' motif of HpTIM are

Four structural differences among HpTIM and the other six TIMs are labeled as I (loop a2-bB), II (L2), III (loop a7-bF), and IV (loop a9-bG). The image was generated using MOLSCRIPT29 and rendered using Raster3D.30 (b) Superimposition of binding pockets of TbTIM (1AG1: cyan) and HpTIM (magenta). Several residues, phosphate ion, and water molecules surrounding the binding pocket of HpTIM are labeled.

shown in Figure 4(b) and Table III. Three direct hydrogen bonds, Lys183 NZ-Asp213 OD1, Leu192 N-Asp213 OD1, and Leu192 O-Asp213 N, are observed. In HpTIM, the second conserved aspartic acid residue, Asp213, of the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif, supplies all hydrogen bond interactions and functionally replaces the first conserved aspartic acid residue in most TIMs. The interaction responsible for linking the C-terminal ``bG-a10-bH-a11-a12'' unit to the bulk of the protein becomes weaker in HpTIM: three direct hydrogen bonds than nine in TbTIM [Fig. 4(b) and Table III]. Two conserved interactions, ``Leu192 N-Asp213 OD1'' and ``Leu192 O-Asp213 N'' in HpTIM as well as ``Ile208 NAsn229 OD1'' and ``Ile208 O-Asn229 N'' in TbTIM, are observed (Table III). Residues Asp213 and Asn229 correspond to the second conserved aspartic acid residue of

the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif: in HpTIM and TbTIM, respectively. The two pairs of residues, Leu192 and Ile208 located at bG as well as Asp213 and Asn229 located at bH, superimpose very well with no conformational change in bG and bH [Fig. 4(b)]. The eight-residue deletion in loop a9-bG of HpTIM makes a shift in the orientation of a9 [IV, Fig. 3(a)].

these mutants from GAP to DHAP direction were measured by coupled-enzyme assay17 as previously performed with the wild-type HpTIM. The interaction of Lys183Asp213 in these mutants are either partially reduced or eliminated. Each of these mutants except K183A exhibited similar Km and kcat values and comparable isomerization activities to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table II). The HpTIM K183A mutant showed the weakest substrate binding [Km 5 9.09 mM (2.6-fold)] and slightly slower catalysis [kcat 5 1.4 3 105 min21 (1.59-fold)] than that of the wild-type. However, the isomerization activity of the K183A mutant [kcat/Km 5 1.5 3 104 min21 mM21] was still within the normal range of activity when compared with other TIMs.26,27 The dampened catalytic activity of the K183A mutant might be due to the absence of the Lys183 NZ-Asp213 OD2 hydrogen bond and the collapsed tethering unit ``bG-a10-bHa11-a12,'' which affects the L6 conformation. Surprisingly, all three hydrogen bonds between a9 and the ``bG-

a10-bH-a11-a12'' unit (Table III) were completely abolished in the HpTIM D213A mutant; however, the isomerization activity of D213A was still maintained. A previous study of four Arg191-Asp227 salt bridge mutants (R191A, R191S, D227A, and D227N) in TbTIM found that the salt bridge played a crucial role in the efficient folding, stability, and catalysis of the enzyme.26 The kinetic constants for the D227N, D227A, and R191S mutants in TbTIM, were similar to that of wild-type. Even the least effective enzyme, R191A, had kinetic constants that were similar to that of wild-type TbTIM (Table II). This was also the case for the HpTIM K183A mutant. According to these results, we suggest that the Arg191-Asp227 salt bridge in TbTIM and the corresponding Lys183-Asp213 salt bridge in HpTIM from the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif of TIMs might not be necessary for enzyme activity. The salt bridge has been thought to preserve the efficient folding of TIMs.42,43 However, this is not true for HpTIM, because this Arg-Asp salt bridge from the first aspartic acid residue of the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif does not exist in HpTIM; yet, its enzymatic activity and overall structure are still maintained. The protein expression levels of the four HpTIM mutants, K183S, K183A, D213Q, and D213A, were comparable to the wild-type protein; nevertheless, the solubility of these mutant proteins was relatively lower, consistent with the knowledge that the TIM barrel is a typical and stable fold, and thus, the overall structure of HpTIM is maintained even though the conserved salt bridge and certain other conserved interactions are eliminated.

ever, the isomerization activity of D213A was not affected. Our results indicate that the salt bridge involving the conserved aspartic acid residues of the ``DX(D/ N)G'' motif does not play a crucial role in the enzymatic function of TIMs but they may contribute to the folding of the protein.

CONCLUSION TIM from H. Pylori (HpTIM) contains a common TIM barrel fold and has a similar structure to other TIMs superfamilies. Three functional key residues, ``LysHis-Glu'' in the active site of TIMs, were observed in HpTIM as ``Lys10-His90-Glu159.'' A highly conserved Arg-Asp salt bridge from the first aspartic acid of the ``DX(D/N)G'' motif is absent in HpTIM, which results in fewer hydrogen bond interactions around this region. Nevertheless, another essential salt bridge ``Lys183Asp213,'' from the second aspartic acid of motif ``DX(D/ N)G'' substitutes for this functional role. Four mutant proteins of HpTIM, K183S, K183A, D213Q, and D213A, related to the Arg-Asp salt bridge of the motif ``211SVDG214'' have been studied to examine the functional necessity of the salt bridge. The K183A mutant showed the weakest substrate binding of the four mutants. The structure of a9, in which K183 is located, was collapsed and, thus, the activity of K183A was affected. For the D213A mutant, the two aspartic acids of the motif ``DX(D/N)G'' were absent and thus the hydrogen bond interactions in this region were abolished; how-
