Protein disulfide isomerase is the most abundant and best studied of the disulfide isomerases that catalyze disulfide bond formation in the endoplasmic reticulum, yet the specifics of how it binds substrate have been elusive. Protein disulfide isomerase is composed of four thioredoxin-like domains (abb¢a¢). Cross-linking studies with radiolabeled peptides and unfolded proteins have shown that it binds incompletely folded proteins primarily via its third domain, b¢. Here, we determined the solution structure of the second and third domains of human protein disulfide isomerase (b and b¢, respectively) by triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. NMR titrations identified a large hydrophobic surface within the b¢ domain that binds unfolded ribonuclease A and the peptides mastoparan and somatostatin. Protein disulfide isomerase-catalyzed refolding of reduced ribonuclease A in vitro was inhibited by these peptides at concentrations equal to their affinity to the bb¢ fragment. Our findings provide a structural basis for previous kinetic and cross-linking studies which have shown that protein disulfide isomerase exhibits a saturable, substratebinding site.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the cell compartment where membrane and secretory proteins fold. The rate-limiting step for the folding of many proteins is the formation of disulfide bonds. As polypeptides are synthesized, their cysteine thiols enter the oxidizing environment of the ER and form covalent intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide links. Although this oxidative folding process occurs spontaneously [1], non-native disulfide-bonded intermediates often occur, acting as kinetic traps along the folding pathway [2,3]. To avoid these, the ER contains a large family of enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) that catalyze both disulfide bond formation and the rearrangement of incorrect disulfide bonds [4­7]. PDI family members are loosely defined by homology to thioredoxin and ER localization. There

are at least 17 PDI family proteins in humans, 13 of which contain CXXC active-site motifs, and 9 have been shown to catalyze disulfide-exchange reactions [4,5]. The best studied and most abundant member of the family is PDI, a ubiquitous enzyme found at very high concentrations in the ER. Its concentration has been estimated to be 10 lm in dog pancreatic microsomes [8], the highest of all ER resident proteins. PDI has four thioredoxin-like domains, a-b-b¢-a¢, where the two a domains contain catalytic CGHC motifs, and the two b domains lack the conserved cysteine residues and are noncatalytic. The linkers between the domains are generally short. The longest is a stretch of 19 amino acids between the b¢ and a¢ domains, referred to as the x-linker [9].

Structure of the bb¢ domains from human PDI

The structure of yeast PDI has been determined in two crystal forms [10,11]. In both structures, the protein adopts a U shape with the catalytic a and a¢ domains on the same side of the protein. Comparison of the two structures shows that considerable flexibility exists in the interdomain linkers. The largest difference is a twist of over 120° in the relative orientations of the a and b domains. In one structure, the catalytic cysteines face each other; in the other, the catalytic residues of the a domain face away from the a¢ domain. The crystal structures also revealed the presence of a hydrophobic pocket (which faces inwards at the base of the U) in the b¢ domain. This b¢-domain pocket was postulated to be the site for binding of incompletely folded proteins, along with adjoining contiguous portions of the a, b and a¢ domains [12]. Cross-linking studies with radiolabelled model peptides identified a homologous, hydrophobic binding site on the b¢ domain of human PDI [13]. Sequence identity between human and yeast PDI for the b and b¢ domains is < 10% (Fig. 1), making it difficult to compare the two proteins accurately. The structures of individual a [14], b [15], a¢ (Protein Data Bank entry code 1X5C) and b¢ [16] domains of human PDI have been solved by NMR or X-ray crystallography. The overall shape of full-length human PDI has been investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering and shown, at low resolution, to adopt a flat annular arrangement [17]. Here, we reported the solution structure of the bb¢ fragment of human PDI and addressed the question of how PDI recognizes unfolded proteins. Using NMR titrations, we mapped the region of PDI that binds unfolded proteins and we showed that peptides which bind to this region inhibit the PDI-catalyzed refolding of ribonuclease A (RNase A).

Results
Spectra of the human PDI-bb¢ domains Dimerization of PDI fragments containing the hydrophobic b¢ domain has complicated structural studies for more than a decade [11]. NMR spectra of the isolated b¢ domain of human PDI showed broad lines and multiple peaks as a result of the presence of a mixture of monomeric and dimeric forms (Fig. S1). These forms can be separated by gel filtration but rapidly exchange at 20­30 °C ( 20% of dimers in 2 h and more than 50% of dimers in 12 h, starting with pure 0.5 mm b¢ monomer at 30 °C). The 1H-15N heteronuclear singlequantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of PDI-b¢ was significantly better upon the addition of hydrophobic compounds, such as peptide ligands or detergents (e.g. 0.3% Triton X-100), that dissociate the dimer (Fig. S1). Alternatively, the b domain moderates the tendency of the b¢ domain to dimerize and significantly slows interconversion. The monomeric form of the PDI-bb¢ fragment converts into < 10% of dimers in 12 h and < 25% of dimers in 3 days, starting with 0.5 mm of monomers at 30 °C. Most of the 1H-15N HSQC signals of the dimeric form of PDI-bb¢ coincide with the signals of the monomeric form or are weak as a result of the high molecular weight of the dimer. The monomeric form gives good-quality spectra required for structural studies. The 1H-15N spectrum of the 25 kDa PDI-bb¢ fragment shows signal dispersion typical for a wellfolded protein and allows determination of the backbone and side-chain NMR signal assignments [18]. Protein structure and comparison The solution structure of the human PDI-bb¢ fragment was calculated based on  2200 NMR-derived con-

straints, including 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) (Fig. S2). The set of best structures is presented in Fig. 2A and the structural statistics are shown in Table 1. The mean rmsd obtained from the average ° structure was 0.7 A for backbone atoms. The greatest uncertainties were in modeling helix a3 in the b domain and the loop between b4¢ and b5¢ in the b¢ domain. A ribbon representation of the PDI-bb¢ structure is presented in Fig. 2B. The structures of both b and b¢ domains corresponded to a babababba thioredoxinlike fold, where the central five-stranded b-sheet is surrounded by a-helices on both sides. Heteronuclear 15 N{1H} NOEs were in the range of 0.6­0.9 (Fig. S2), indicating the absence of a flexible interdomain linker. Contacts between the b and b¢ domains could be observed as long-range NOEs between protons He1(His231) / HN(Gly251), Ha(His231) / Ha(Gly251), Me(Val155) / HN(Leu234) and He1(Phe209) / HN(Leu236). Analysis of RDCs for the two domains yielded the same degree of alignment and rhombicity, which further confirms the rigid structure of the bb¢ domain fragment (Fig. S2). It is interesting to note that the protein surface and electrostatic potential is quite different for the b and b¢ domains (Fig. 2C). The pairwise Ca-atomic coordinate rmsd between human PDI-bb¢ and the crystal structure of yeast PDI ° [10] was 3.5 A for 198 structurally equivalent amino acids (DALI Z-factor = 14.6). The principal difference between the protein fold of human and yeast PDI bb¢ domains was an extra helix, a3, in the b domain of the human protein and an extra a-helix in the b¢ domain from yeast (Figs 1 and 3B). In this sense, the fold of human PDI-bb¢ is more similar to the fold of

human ERp57-bb¢. ERp57 is a disulfide isomerase that has the same domain architecture as PDI but shares very low sequence identity with PDI and is glycoprotein specific via interaction with calnexin or calreticulin. The rmsd between human PDI-bb¢ and the crystal ° structure of human ERp57-bb¢ [19] is 4.5 A for 209 amino acids (Z = 14.9). A comparison of the b domain in our PDI-bb¢ structure with the reported solution structure of the isolated b domain [15] gave ° an rmsd of 1.6 A for 101 amino acids (Z = 16.1), showing that the structure is not changed significantly by interaction with the b¢ domain. The pairwise Ca-atomic coordinate comparison of our solution structure of human PDI-bb¢ and the crystal structure of the I289A mutant of the human PDIb¢x fragment [16] showed differences with an rmsd of ° 2.6 A for 116 amino acids (DALI Z-factor = 12.1). Superimposition of these structures is shown in Fig. 3C. The differences could result from (a) an effect of the second b domain in our PDI-bb¢ structure, (b) the I289A mutation, or (c) the presence of the x-linker in the crystal structure. In the b¢x structure, the hydrophobic x-linker folds back and binds to the b¢ domain in the region that we identified here as the hydrophobic peptide-binding pocket (vide infra). Binding site for unfolded ligands Analysis of the PDI-bb¢ electrostatic surface revealed a highly hydrophobic region within the b¢ domain (Fig. 2C). Previous work has demonstrated that the amphipathic peptides mastoparan and D-somatostatin can bind directly to PDI, and that this interaction is Tri-

of strong shifts of the NMR signals for residues in helices a1¢, a3¢ and all five b-strands of the b¢ domain. The most strongly shifted HSQC signals were Thr241, Ala245, Phe249, Gly250, His256, Asp297, Glu322, Met324 when titrated with mastoparan (Fig. 4A), Thr241, Gln243, Ile248, Gly250, Asp297, Arg300, Ile318, Thr325 when titrated with somatostatin and Thr241, Gly251, His256, Ile318, Thr319 and Glu321 when titrated with unfolded RNase A (Figs 1 and 4C). The chemical shift changes were plotted throughout the PDI-bb¢ sequence, and affected residues were mapped onto the protein backbone trace (Fig. 4B,D). A close-up view of the hydrophobic pocket in the b¢ domain is shown in Fig. 3A. The binding pocket is large and could accommodate multiple hydrophobic residues. The signals identified by NMR belong to hydrophobic residues of the binding pocket or neighboring residues, which could be influenced by steric contacts with the side chains of the hydrophobic residues and small changes in the conformation of the b¢ domain. From the NMR titrations, the dissociation constant (Kd) was 130 ± 30 lm for mastoparan and 35 ± 15 lm for both somatostatin and unfolded RNase A (Fig. S2). The higher affinity of somatostatin and unfolded RNase A compared with mastoparan is probably a result of the larger number of hydrophobic residues with aromatic side chains. In control NMR titrations, folded RNase A showed essentially no binding to PDI-bb¢ (Kd > 2 mm), as hydrophobic patches of RNase A are not exposed to solvent in the folded state. The structure of the bb¢ domains of the glycoprotein-specific PDI homolog, ERp57, did not reveal a similar hydrophobic-binding pocket [19]. ERp57 instead relies on substrate recruitment by the lectin-like chaperones calnexin and calreticulin, which bind the ERp57 b¢ domain on the surface opposite to the corresponding hydrophobic surface in PDI [5]. Nonetheless, many of the hydrophobic residues in the PDI-b¢ pocket (shown in Fig. 3A) are similar in other PDI family

members (Fig. S3). It is likely that PDIp, PDILT, ERp27 and ERp44 share features with PDI concerning how they bind unfolded proteins [20­22]. Residue-specific interactions The importance of individual amino acids in human PDI for the binding of D-somatostatin was previously investigated [23], but many of the reported mutations were not in the region of the PDI-b¢ binding pocket. In that study it was reported that the mutation of residue Ile289 (numbered as Ile272 without the PDI signal sequence), which is located at the bottom of the b¢ hydrophobic pocket (Fig. 3A), significantly reduced cross-linking with D-somatostatin. To explore the role of individual amino acids in the b¢ domain, we prepared two mutants (I289A and F240E) in both the bb¢ fragment and the full-length protein. Surprisingly, NMR titration experiments of the binding of somatostatin and mastoparan to the PDI-bb¢ I289A mutant did not show a significant effect in comparison with wild-type bb¢ domains (data not shown). We also investigated the effect of the I289A mutant on the

PDI-catalyzed refolding of RNase A using a continuous spectroscopic assay of 2¢3¢ cCMP hydrolysis (Fig 5A). In agreement with the NMR titration, the I289A mutant did not diminish the foldase activity of the PDI. By contrast, the mutation of F240E strongly decreased PDI-catalyzed refolding. This mutation destablized the b¢ domain (most 1H-15N HSQC signals of the b¢-domain of the PDI-bb¢ F240E mutant were shifted in comparison with wild-type protein and strongly broadened) and prevented peptide binding in the context of the bb¢ fragment. To identify peptide residues involved in binding to PDI, we carried out reciprocal NMR titrations by observing changes in the signals for mastoparan following the addition of PDI-bb¢ protein (Fig. 6). At the lowest concentration of PDI-bb¢, at least half of the 14 mastoparan signals were significantly shifted by binding to the b¢ domain of PDI. No strong selectivity in residue binding was found. At a protein / mastoparan ratio of 1 : 15, practically all of the mastoparan signals (except for those of the terminal amino acids) were strongly broadened as a result of binding to the PDI-bb¢ protein. Further work is necessary to

The refolding rate of the F240E mutant was 50% lower than that of the wild-type PDI or the I289A mutant relative to spontaneous refolding in the absence of PDI. A small increase in absorbance was observed in the absence of RNase A. (B) Peptides that bind to the b¢ domain inhibit PDI refolding of RNase A in a dose-dependent manner. Folding reactions were carried out with the indicated concentrations of a control peptide (KEKEKVKQIPKAPK), mastoparan, or D-somatostatin, and the activity of RNase A was measured in a gel assay of tRNA hydrolysis. In the presence of the control peptide, PDI rapidly refolded RNase A, leading to the complete degradation of the substrate tRNA. Both mastoparan and D-somatostatin blocked refolding.

Inhibition of PDI in RNase A refolding In order to understand better the contribution of the b¢ binding site to PDI activity, the inhibitory influence on the refolding of RNase A caused by the peptides binding b¢ was examined. In the assay, incubation of unfolded RNase with PDI led to RNase activity, which was measured by the hydrolysis of tRNA. In the absence of an inhibitor or in the presence of a highly charged peptide, RNase A was rapidly refolded in 10 min, leading to the disappearance of tRNA (Fig. 5B). Addition of the hydrophobic peptides, mastoparan or D-somatostatin, inhibited RNase A refolding at concentrations similar to their affinity to the bb¢ fragment.

refolding at 120 lm, whereas D-somatostatin blocked refolding at concentrations between 30 and 60 lm. These are similar to the KI of 80 lm reported for the inhibition of PDI glutathione-insulin transhydrogenase activity by the peptide somatostatin [24]. Control experiments with di(o-aminobenzyl)-labeled oxidized glutathione showed no inhibition of PDI oxido-reductase activity by D-somatostatin (data not shown). A systematic study of the kinetics of PDI-mediated RNase A refolding showed that the refolding rate of RNase A is saturable with increasing concentrations of unfolded RNase A [25]. The Km measured, 7 lm, is close to the affinity measured by NMR for unfolded RNase A binding to the isolated bb¢ domains. The secondary importance of other domains for the binding of large protein substrates has been previously demonstrated [13,26]. Mutational analysis of PDI revealed that loss of the two cysteines in the C-terminal a¢ domain increased the Km to 30 lm, and loss of an additional cysteine in the a domain resulted in an increase of the Km to 50 lm [25,27]. On the other hand, the role of the b domain seems to be to act simply as a spacer to allow room for the a and a¢ domains to interact with substrate thiols. By NMR, we detected no interactions between unfolded RNase A and the b domain.

disulfide bond formation and protein folding. A large, multivalent hydrophobic binding site is an effective way to bind a variety of substrates when unfolded and to release them once they acquire their native conformation with fewer hydrophobic residues exposed. To conclude, structural analysis of the bb¢ fragment of PDI has revealed a large hydrophobic surface that interacts with peptides and unfolded RNase A. This site appears to be responsible for the saturable kinetics observed for RNase A folding by PDI, and blocking the site strongly inhibits the activity of PDI. Structural analysis of the substrate-binding sites of other disulfide isomerases should shed more light on their substrate specificities and help to explain why such a large variety of disulfide isomerases is found in the mammalian ER [5].

Experimental procedures
Sample preparation
PDI was cloned from cDNA derived from human bronchial epithelial cells. The bb¢ (residues P135­S357) and b¢ (residues L236­S357) fragments were subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. To provide isotope-labeled samples for NMR, cultures were grown at 37 °C on minimal M9 medium supplemented with 15N ammonium chloride and [13C]-glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA, USA) to produce uniformly 15 N- or 15N,13C-labeled proteins. The protein was purified by GST-affinity chromatography on a Glutathione Sepharose 4B column (Amersham). PreScission protease (Amersham) was used to cleave the fusion protein from GST. The resulting proteins contained five extraneous N-terminal residues (GPLGS). Further purification was carried out using gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex-75 column. Mass spectral analysis confirmed the sequence composition of human PDI-bb¢. The NMR samples contained 0.1-1 mm protein in 90% H2O / 10% D2O, 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 70 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Unlabeled 14 amino acid mastoparan INLKALAALAK KIL, D-somatostatin AGSKNFFWKTFTSS and charged KEKEKVKQIPKAPK peptides were chemically synthesized at EZBiolab (Westfield, IN, USA) and additionally purified by reverse-phase HPLC. Somatostatin AGCKN FFWKTFTSC ( 97% pure by HPLC) was purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Bovine pancreatic RNase A from Sigma was unfolded and reduced for 20 min at room temperature in 0.1 m Tris / HCl (pH 8.0) containing 6 m guanidine / HCl and 20 mm dithiothreitol [33]. Unfolded

Discussion
There are many examples of chaperone proteins that bind unfolded protein segments via hydrophobic patches. The best known is cytosolic Hsp70, which binds and releases, through cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis, short stretches of hydrophobic polypeptides that are in an extended conformation [28]. In Escherichia coli, the ClpA­ClpP chaperones disaggregate and unfold proteins in order to degrade them. ClpA binds to substrates with low affinity, but broad specificity, via a hydrophobic surface formed by two helices in its N-terminal domain [29]. Multisubunit GroEL binds in vivo to more than 10% of newly synthesized polypeptides [30] via a groove between two alpha helices that is lined with hydrophobic residues [31]. Nevertheless, hydrophobic binding is not a universal mechanism of chaperone function, and other chaperones use charged and polar residues for interactions between the chaperone and the substrate [31,32]. The relatively weak binding of PDI-bb¢ to peptides and unfolded RNase A, and the large size of the binding pocket, is consistent with a low degree of specificity for hydrophobic ligands. High specificity is not expected because PDI acts on many substrates with different primary sequences. It is also important that substrate proteins are released from PDI after

RNase A was desalted in 0.1% formic acid on a NAP-5 column (Amersham) and lyophilized. The maximum solubility of the unfolded RNase A in the NMR phosphate buffer was  0.2 mm.

Mutagenesis of PDI
Point mutants of full-length PDI and the bb¢ domains were prepared in the vectors used for the expression of the wildtype proteins using QuickchangeÔ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) with mismatched primers and were verified by DNA sequencing.

NMR spectroscopy
NMR spectra were recorded at 30 °C on Bruker DRX 600 MHz and Varian Unity Inova 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance cryoprobes and pulsed-field gradients. Proton homonuclear NOEs were obtained from 15 N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra recorded at 800 MHz with a mixing time of 80 ms. Amide heteronuclear 15 N{1H} NOEs were measured to determine high-mobility regions of protein [34]. 1H-15N RDCs with precision ± 1 Hz were extracted from in-phase/anti-phase-HSQC experiments [35] on an isotropic sample and on a sample containing 12 mgÆmL)1 of Pf1 phage. NMR spectra were processed using nmrpipe [36] and xwinnmr (Bruker Biospin, Milton, Canada) software, and then analyzed using xeasy [37] and nmrview [38]. Detailed analysis of ligand binding to PDI-bb¢ was carried out by comparison of chemical shifts for backbone amide signals in 1H-15N HSQC spectra. HSQC spectra were recorded at 1 : 2, 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 4 : 1 and 8 : 1 peptide to protein ratios. The magnitude of amide chemical shift changes was calculated as [(D1H shift)2 + (D15N shift · 0.2)2]1 / 2, in p.p.m. Values of dissociation constants were obtained by monitoring the chemical shift changes as a function on ligand concentration using a simple binding model. A least-squares search was performed by varying the values of Kd and the chemical shift of fully saturated protein. Standard deviations were derived for each Kd value by comparing different cross-peaks in the HSQC spectra. Assignments of the amide proton signals of mastoparan were determined using 2D NOESY with a mixing time of 200 ms and TOCSY experiments on a 2 mm sample at 10 °C.

The protein structure was refined using the standard protocol in CNS version 1.1 [44], and the structural statistics for the 10 best structures is shown in Table 1. The atomic coordinates have been deposited as the Protein Data Bank entry 2K18. The pairwise coordinate rmsd comparisons between different proteins were obtained using dali [45]. module software [46] was used for comparison of the RDCs with their backcalculated values. Structural figures were generated using pymol [47] and molmol [48]. protskin (C. Deprez and K. Gehring; http://www.mcgnmr.mcgill.ca/ProtSkin) software was used for mapping chemical shift changes onto protein backbone traces. procheck-nmr software [49] was used to check the protein stereochemical geometry (Table 1).

Refolding of bovine RNase A by PDI
PDI-catalyzed refolding of RNase A was measured in two assays: a continuous spectroscopic assay of 2¢3¢ cCMP hydrolysis; and a gel-based assay of RNA degradation. PDI and unfolded RNase A were prepared as described above. The first assay monitored the absorbance change at 296 nm and was carried out as previously described [50] with the following modifications. Refolding was carried out in 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 0.75 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm NaCl. The concentration of reduced RNase A in the refolding reaction was 4.2 lm, and the concentration of PDI was 0.6 lm. In the second assay, 0.18 lm RNase A was refolded with 0.3 lm PDI in 25 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, 2 mm reduced glutathione, 0.75 mm CaCl2 and 100 mm NaCl. Samples were removed during folding and free thiols were blocked with an equal volume of 0.5 m iodoacetamide. The RNase A activity at each time-point was assayed by incubation with 10 lg of yeast tRNA (Sigma) for 15 min at 25 °C followed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide for visualization. Gels were exposed to UV light and photographed using an Alpha Innotech Alpha Imager. Control experiments with di(o-aminobenzyl)-labeled oxidized glutathione (a gift of Bulent Mutus) were carried out as described previously [51].

Structure calculations
Regions of a-helical or b-strand secondary structure were determined based on Ca-chemical shifts [39] and the NOE patterns [40]. ARIA-assigned [41] and manually verified NOEs were collected from 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra. Backbone angles were estimated from the chemical shifts using the TALOS database [42]. The starting structure was generated with modeller [43] using the yeast PDI
