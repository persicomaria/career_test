A series of IAP antagonists based on an azabicyclooctane scaffold was designed and synthesized. The most potent of these compounds, 14b, binds to the XIAP BIR3 domain, the BIR domain of ML-IAP, and the BIR3 domain of c-IAP1 with Ki values of 140, 38, and 33 nM, respectively. These compounds promote degradation of c-IAP1, activate caspases, and lead to decreased viability of breast cancer cells without affecting normal mammary epithelial cells. Finally, compound 14b inhibits tumor growth when dosed orally in a breast cancer xenograft model.
Introduction Programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is a crucial mechanism for maintaining homeostasis and removal of damaged or malignant cells. This pathway is tightly controlled by a number of positive and negative regulatory elements. The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAPa) proteins negatively regulate this process through a variety of mechanisms including direct inhibition of effector caspase enzymes or modulation of TNF receptormediated signaling pathways.1-6 Members of this family are up-regulated in various cancers and promote resistance to chemotherapy. Thus, inhibition of these proteins may be a new therapeutic mechanism for treating cancer.7,8 Each of the IAP proteins contains at least one BIR domain, some of which bind to the N-termini of their targets through interactions with a shallow cleft. Although the peptide-binding pocket of the BIR domains is shallow, several groups have reported peptidomimetics9-12 or other small molecules13-16 that bind to this pocket with high affinity, disrupt IAP-caspase or IAP-SMAC binding, and show in vivo efficacy in a mouse xenograft model of cancer.17,18 In this communication we report our initial efforts toward developing a molecule with reduced peptide character that would possess the appropriate potency, permeability, and pharmacokinetic properties to be a useful therapeutic agent.

parts of the peptide, the software program CAVEAT was utilized.19 This program takes as input the structure of a peptide or small molecule bound in the target receptor site. Selected bond vectors are searched against prebuilt databases of threedimensional compounds to find ring systems that could connect to and maintain the vectors in their input spatial arrangement. We used the 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of peptide AlaVal-Pro-2,2-diphenethylamine (1) bound to the ML-IAP BIR domain as the input structure (Figure 1A).20 One vector was defined from the proline nitrogen atom to the valine carbonyl carbon atom, while a second vector was defined from the proline carbonyl carbon atom to the diphenethylamine nitrogen (Figure 2A). CAVEAT databases of minimized compounds from commercially available small molecules were constructed and searched. Ring systems that overlapped with atoms of the MLIAP BIR domain were not considered in subsequent analyses. The conformations and qualitative geometric fit of all unique hits were examined visually. In particular, some fused-ring motifs (Figure 2B) looked especially promising from a geometric perspective. However, upon further inspection, these were deemed either synthetically infeasible within our desired time frame or chemically unstable. These bicyclic motifs provided the inspiration to manually search the literature for similar bicyclic templates that would be more synthetically accessible; from this search emerged an azabicyclooctane (Figure 2C). A further conceptual jump was to realize that use of this scaffold would also require reversing the direction of the P3-P4 amide bond for both synthetic accessibility and geometric fit. When the azabicyclooctane scaffold was computationally inserted into the rest of the peptide, using a reversed amide to link the diphenyl group to the scaffold (Figure 2D), it was found to fit well within the peptide binding site. Using Glide, a minimized conformation of this molecule was docked to the ML-IAP BIR domain peptide-binding site.21 The conformations that emerged were similar to the conformations of 1 both in the crystal structure and in the docked model (Figure 1B). The docking score of the azabicyclooctane compound (-9.5) is comparable to that of 1 (-9.3). The main difference between the crystal structure and docked models relates to which of the prochiral phenyl groups is buried in the P4 pocket. In the crystal structure of 1, the pro-S phenyl ring of the 2,2-diphenylethylamine moiety packs into the hydrophobic P4 pocket where it

makes extensive contacts with protein residues Thr116, Lys121Arg123, and Gly130-Gln132 (Figure 1A). The second (pro-R) phenyl ring of the 2,2-diphenylethylamine moiety packs more on the surface of the protein with one edge making contact with the hydrophobic portion of the side chain of Lys121. By contrast, both models predicted that the pro-R phenyl group would insert into the P4 pocket and the pro-S phenyl group would be more exposed (Figure 1B). Synthesis The synthesis of this scaffold is based on the work of Corey22 and Kawabata.23 We began with amine 2, which when treated

with I2 in CH2Cl2 provided bicyclic amino iodide 3 (Scheme 1). Subjection of this crude mixture to NH4OH and THF led to displacement of the iodide by ammonia, with retention of configuration, providing diastereomeric diamines 4 and 5. These compounds were separated by HPLC on a C18 column, eluting with 0-10% MeCN/H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The desired diastereomer 5 elutes first under these conditions. Assignment of the stereochemistry of 4 and 5 was made initially by carrying both isomers forward to IAP antagonists and comparing potency in the fluorescence polarization assay. Our assignment was subsequently verified by X-ray analysis of a cocrystal of an antagonist with an IAP BIR domain (vida infra). While acceptable for making exploratory quantities of these compounds, the requirement for separating diastereomers by HPLC limited our ability to make larger amounts of material and led us to investigate another nitrogen source. Thus, treatment of iodide 3 with sodium azide in a mixture of acetone-water cleanly led to a mixture of azides 6 and 7, which were separable on silica gel, greatly improving throughput. Hydrogenation under mild conditions provided the primary amine 5, with no trace of benzyl deprotection.

After experimenting with several protecting group schemes, we arrived at (trimethylsilyl)ethyl carbamate (Teoc) as the optimal group for the primary amine. Thus, the primary amine of 5 was acylated with Teoc-p-nitrophenyl carbonate under biphasic conditions, and the benzyl group was removed by hydrogenolysis with 20% Pd(OH)2 · C, to provide amine 9 in 46% yield for the two steps. We chose to fix the P1 and P2 amino acids as N-Me-Ala and tert-Leu, respectively, for this study, as SAR in the peptide series demonstrated that these changes retained potency and afforded increased hydrolytic stability (data not shown). Thus, coupling of Cbz-protected tertLeu was accomplished with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-Nethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and the Cbz group removed with H2 and 20% Pd(OH)2 · C to afford amine 11 in 72% yield over two steps. The P1 amino acid was coupled in Boc-protected form with EDC. Finally, the Teoc group was removed with tris(dimethylamino)sulfonium difluorotrimethylsilicate (TASF) in warm MeCN.24 This route was readily amenable to preparation of half-gram quantities of common intermediate 13. With common intermediate 13 in hand, we sought to explore the SAR of the P4 position. Carboxylic acid derivatives were selected by a combination of computational virtual reagent selection and medicinal chemistry principles. These were coupled through either the acid chloride or EDC dehydration. The Boc group was removed with TFA, and the final product was purified by HPLC. The structures of the most potent antagonists 14a-f, made via this route, are shown in Table 1. A complete list of the antagonists synthesized is in the Supporting Information. The Ki values binding to the BIR3 domain of XIAP and the single BIR domain of ML-IAP were determined using a fluorescence polarization competition assay.10 The results are

summarized in Table 1. The potency of diphenylacetyl derivative 14a was within 2-fold of the potency of the peptide lead 1 (Ki ) 43 nM for MLXBIR3SG, a chimeric BIR domain that preserves the native ML-IAP peptide-binding site,20 and Ki ) 345 nM for XIAP BIR3). Most of the other moieties chosen for the P4 position lost potency relative to the starting peptide. However, a series of 1-napthyl derivatives 14b-e retained or increased affinity for both MLXBIR3SG and XIAP BIR3. The 2-napthyl isomer 14f lost affinity for XIAP BIR3 and retained affinity for MLXBIR3SG, making it the most selective compound in the series. This series also shows that polar substituents are not tolerated in the P4 pocket. To gain a more detailed understanding of the interactions between the azabicyclooctane-containing IAP antagonists and the BIR domain of ML-IAP, the crystal structures of complexes between MLXBIR3SG and compounds 14a and 14b were determined to resolutions of 1.8 and 1.9 Å, respectively (Figure 3). X-ray data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Supporting Information Table 1. Key contacts observed in the structure of 1 in complex with the ML-IAP BIR domain (Figure 1A) are conserved in the complexes with 14a and 14b. In particular, hydrogen bonds with the main chain of Gln132 and the side chain carboxylate of Asp138 are maintained. In the case of 14a, the phenyl rings of the diphenylacetyl moiety are positioned very similarly to the phenyl rings of the 2,2diphenylethylamine moiety of 1. The 1-naphthyl group of 14b also makes extensive contacts with the hydrophobic P4 pocket of the protein, although in order to make these contacts, the conformations of the azabicyclooctane and the intervening amide group differ slightly from that observed for 14a. The azabicyclooctane scaffold both reverses the direction of the P3-P4 amide bond and adds extra conformational constraint relative to 1. We sought to dissect these two effects through the synthesis of control molecules. Thus, the two peptides 15a and 15b (Table 2) were synthesized using routine peptide chemistry from S-2-(aminomethyl)-1-tert-butoxycarbonylpyrrolidine. These compounds lack the constraint of the bicyclic scaffold and yet retain the reversal of the P3-P4 amide bond. Compound 15a lost approximately 3- to 5-fold in binding affinity relative to 14a, while 15b lost approximately 10- to 15-fold in binding affinity relative to 14b. These data show that

the extra ring provided by the scaffold has a significant contribution to the potency of these antagonists. A selection of the more potent IAP antagonists were tested in 3-day cell-viability assays (Figure 4, Table 3). These compounds led to a decrease in cell viability in the MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line. This is in contrast to starting peptide 1, which does not induce cell death in a 3-day viability assay. These compounds did not cause cell death in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). To assess the mechanism of cell killing, these compounds were tested for activation of the effector caspases 3 and 7 in the breast cancer cell lines BT-549 and MDA-MB-231. These compounds were found to activate caspases 3 and 7 in a dose dependent manner. The potency in the caspase activation assay

correlates well with the potency in the viability assay. Example data for compounds 14a and 14b are shown in Figure 5, and potencies are tabulated in Table 4. Consistent with the viability assays, these compounds did not activate effector caspases in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). The effects of the IAP antagonist compounds 14a and 14b on the stability of c-IAP1 protein were also examined. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells with 14a for 1 h had only a minor effect on the levels of c-IAP1, while similar treatment with 14b led to almost complete loss of c-IAP1 protein (Figure 6) in agreement with reported studies.2,4 These data correlate with the measured potency of 14a and 14b against the c-IAP1 BIR3 domain (14a Ki ) 129 nM; 14b Ki ) 33 nM).

Figure 6. Treatment with IAP antagonist compound 14b leads to degradation of c-IAP1. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated for 1 h with the indicated concentrations of 14b or 14a, and cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies.

In preparation for efficacy studies, compounds 14a and 14b were evaluated for oral exposure in mice. Thus, each was dosed at 25 mg/kg as a solution in 15% aqueous hydroxypropyl- cyclodextrin with 20 mM succinic acid. Both compounds were found to have significant exposure upon oral dosing. Compound 14a was found to have a Cmax of 5.0 µM, AUC of 16 h · µM, and T1/2 of 1.5 h, while 14b was found to have a Cmax of 3.6 µM, AUC of 5.0 h · µM, and T1/2 of 1.3 h. Compounds 14a and 14b were further studied in a mouse cancer xenograft model (Figure 7). To that effect, mice bearing tumors (n ) 14 per group) derived from the MDA-MD-231 cell line were dosed orally with either vehicle or compounds at 50 (mg/kg)/day. Compound 14b potently inhibited tumor growth in this model, with a median time to progression (defined as time to 6-fold increase in tumor volume from day 0) of 25 days, versus 14 days for the vehicle control, without affecting body weight. Compound 14a had little effect on either tumor growth or body weight. Conclusion We have designed and synthesized a novel azabicyclooctane proline mimetic and incorporated it into IAP antagonists. Several of these compounds were more potent than lead peptide 1, with Ki values of <50 nM against select IAP BIR domains. X-ray crystallographic analysis confirmed that these compounds bind to the expected binding site on the ML-IAP BIR domain. These compounds induce degradation of c-IAP1 and activate effector caspases in cancer cell lines in preference to normal cell lines. Compounds that potently activated caspases also lead to decreased viability of cancer cell lines without affecting "normal", nontumor cells. This potency in cell culture assay translates to significant potency in a xenograft model of breast cancer where compound 14b nearly doubles the time to progression when dosed orally. These studies further validate the IAP proteins as promising targets for cancer treatment. Experimental Section

Inhibition of MDA-MB-231-X1.1 Xenograft Tumor Growth by IAP Antagonists. All procedures involving animals were performed in accordance with Genentech's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. To generate tumors, 100 µL of a single-cell suspension containing 1 × 107 MDA-MB-231-X1.1 cells (in-house GFP-expressing variants of MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA)) were injected subcutaneously into the upper right flanks of 8-week-old female C.B-17 SCID.bg mice (Charles River Laboratories, Hollister, CA). Tumor volume was calculated using the mean diameter measured with vernier calipers using the formula V ) 0.5ab2, where a and b are the smallest and largest perpendicular tumor diameters, respectively. Once-daily administration of IAP antagonists by oral gavage was initiated once tumors reached a size of 200 mm3 (1.5 weeks after inoculation). IAP antagonists were formulated in 15% hydroxypropyl- -cyclodetrin and 20 mM succinic acid and administered in a volume of 100 µL. Tumor volumes and body weights were measured twice weekly until end of study.
