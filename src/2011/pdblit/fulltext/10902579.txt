Summary The stereospeci city of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase was examined by steady-state kinetics and x-ray crystallography. The enzyme has the intriguing property that the apoenzyme in the absence of divalent metal showed a selectivity for the inactive l-enantiomer of the substrate isocitrate, whereas the enzyme containing magnesium showed selectivity for the physiologically active d-enantiomer. The hydrogen atom on the C2 carbon that is transferred during the reaction was, in both the d- and l-isocitrate complexes, in an orientation very close to that expected for delivery of a hydride ion to the cosubstrate NADP+ . The beta-carboxylate that is eliminated as a CO2 molecule during the reaction occupied the same site on the protein in both the d- and l-isocitrate complexes. In addition, the C3 carbon was in the same protein site in both the d- and l-enantiomers. Only the fourth group, the OH atom, was in a very different position in the apo enzyme and in the metal-containing complexes. A four-location model is necessary to explain the enantiomeric speci city of IDH in contrast to the conventional three-point attachment model. The thermodynamic and kinetic rami cations of this model are explored.

INTRODUCTION The eld of stereoisomerism is marked by penetrating questions and simple model solutions. It began in 1848 with Pasteur's discovery and separation of two different crystal forms (d and l) of tartaric acid that, when dissolved, rotated the plane of polarized light in opposite directions (1). The questions as to how this could happen were nally answered by the elegant tetrahederal carbon model of van't Hoff and Le Bel (2). A new question that arose because of pharmocological and enzymatic speci city as to how a protein can distinguish between enantiomers was apparently answered by the three-point attachment model of Easson and Stedman (3) and Ogston (4). But further questions arose, in this case from Wilcox et al., who stated that there had to be some added restraint (5), and from Bentley, who pointed out that the three-point attachment model involved the tacit assumption that an approach to the protein surface could come from only one direction (6, 7 ). Topiol and Sabio (8) and Temussi et al. (9) also touched on some features of stereoisomerism that require more than three points of consideration. The recent paper by Mesecar and Koshland provided the death knell of the three-point attachment model by the nding that the same three groups of both d- and l-enantiomers of isocitrate bind to the same three locations on the protein molecule (10). In addition, Mesecar and Koshland proposed (10) a four-location model to explain how enantiomeric discrimination is achieved in biological systems. In this paper we shall examine the geometries, kinetics, and thermodynamics of the binding of the d- and l-isocitrate to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH),4 the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase , to gain insight into the nature of ligand binding restraints in general and stereospeci city in

particular. Speci cally, we approach the problem of why l-isocitrate binds to the apoenzyme with no evidence of d-isocitrate binding, and why d-isocitrate binds to the Mg­ enzyme complex with no evidence of l-isocitrate binding.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Chemicals. All chemicals and solvents used were reagent grade and were used without further puri cation. Both d-isocitrate and d,l-isocitrate were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Chelex-100 metal-chelating resin was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). All other chemicals were from Fisher Scienti c, Aldrich, Sigma, or Fluka. Water for all solutions was deionized and puri ed with a Milli-Q water puri cation system (Millipore). To remove trace metal contaminants, all solutions and water were treated with » 1 g of Chelex-100 resin per 100 ml of solution by stirring overnight at 4 ±C. The Chelex-100 resin was removed from each solution by ltering through a sterile 0.45-l m pore-size lter/ ask. All solutions were stored in lowmetal-content plastic containers. IDH Puri cation. Escherichia coli isocitrate dehydrogen ase was puri ed from E. coli strain JLK1, which contains the IDH overexpression plasmid pTK-513 (11, 12). The puri cation method used was modi ed from previously reported procedures (12, 13). Brie y, 3 L of JLK1 cells were grown, harvested, and lysed as described (12, 13). Then the lysate was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation (30% and 80% saturated solutions) and the 80% ammonium sulfate pellet containing IDH activity was dissolved and dialyzed against DEAE buffer (60 mM Na2 HPO4 , 15.5 mM citric acid, 10 mM MgCl2 , and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The protein was next loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow column (Pharmacia) that was then washed with 5 column volumes of DEAE buffer. IDH activity was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.3 M in DEAE buffer. The IDH activity peak obtained was then loaded directly onto a Matrex Red-Gel-A column (Amicon/Millipore ), and the column was washed with 5 column volumes of Red-A buffer (7 mM Nas HPO4 , 1.8 mM citric acid, 10 mM MgCl2 , 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2% glycerol). IDH was eluted by using a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1.0 M in Red-A buffer. The resulting IDH activity peak was concentrated to » 50 mg/ml and was dialyzed against nal buffer (5 mM Na2 HPO4 , 100 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol). The enzyme was stored at ¡ 85 ±C. In all, » 300 mg of highly puri ed IDH having a speci c activity between 90 and 105 units/mg at 25 ±C is obtained with this revised puri cation procedure. IDH Activity Assay. The reaction rates for the IDH-catalyzed reaction were determined by monitoring the production of NADPH over time at 340 nm in a 1.00-cm path length cuvette. The concentration of NADPH was determined by using a molar absorptivity for NADPH of 6.22 mM ¡ 1 cm ¡ 1 . The reactions were conducted at 25.0 ±C using a circulating water bath cell holder, and data were collected on a Hewlett-Packard model 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. All reactions were per-

formed in Tris buffer (pH 7.8) that contained 1 mM NADP + , 10 mM MgCl2 , and various concentrations of either pure d-isocitrate or d-isocitrate in a d,l-isocitrate racemic solution. The concentrations of NADP + , pure d-isocitrate, and d-isocitrate in the d,l-isocitrate racemic solution were determined by an end-point IDH assay in which the substrate of interest was held in limiting concentration and the other substrates were in excess. A large amount of IDH was added to drive the reaction quickly to completion, and the total change in absorbance at 340 nm attributable to NADPH production was used to quantitate the substrate concentration. Five assays were run for each substrate concentration determination; the resulting standard deviation was < 2% for each substrate. IDH concentrations were determined at 280 nm by using a molar absorptivity for IDH of 66,300 M ¡ 1 cm ¡ 1 (12). Kinetic Data Analysis. Initial rate data as a function of disocitrate concentration were t to the Michaelis ­ Menten equation for determination of VMax and K M values: v = VMax / (1 + K M / [S])

[1]

Kinetic simulations of velocity versus substrate concentration curves were performed by using a modi ed form of the equation that describes competitive inhibition:
¤ v = VMax / {1 + K M / [S] + (K M [I] / K I / [S])}

[2]

Replacing the concentration of inhibitor, [I] (i.e., l-isocitrate), with that of the substrate, [S] (i.e., d-isocitrate), results in a modi ed form of the equation: v = VMax / (1 + K M / [S] + K M / K I )

[3]

This situation arises with a racemic substrate mixture in which one enantiomer is a substrate and the other enantiomer is a competitive inhibitor. The data were t to the equations by using the nonlinear, least-squares program Table-Curve 2D version 4.0 from SPSS Scienti c (Chicago, IL). Kinetic simulations were performed with the same program. IDH Crystallization and X-Ray Data Collection. IDH, stored in metal-free nal buffer, was diluted to 25, 30, 35, and 40 mg/ml with metal-free 2 £ crystallization buffer (1£ buffer is 35 mM Na2 HPO4 , 9 mM citric acid, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM DTT, pH 5.4) and was crystallized from hanging drops consisting of 5 l l each of these IDH solutions and 5 l l each of 34%, 36%, 38%, 40%, 42%, and 44% saturated (NH4 )2 SO4 solutions in crystallization buffer. Smaller crystals, 0.2 to 0.5 mm in the longest dimension, were used for synchrotron data collection because the mosaic spread tends to be less for the smaller, ashfrozen crystals (A. Mesecar, unpublished observations). IDH crystals were transferred to a metal-ion ­ de cient arti cial mother liquor consisting of 45 ­ 50% saturated (NH4 )2 SO4 , 30% glycerol, and 25 mM Tris, buffered at pH 7.8, that was supplemented with the components of three separate soaks: Soak-1, 100 mM d,l-isocitrate with the crystals surrounded by

Chelex-100 beads; Soak-2, 100 mM d,l-isocitrate with 100 mM MgCl2 in the absence of Chelex-100 beads; and Soak-3, 100 mM pure d-isocitrate with the crystals surrounde d by Chelex-100 beads. After the soaks had proceeded for » 1 h each, the crystals were mounted on a 20-l m-thick nylon loop (Hampton Research) and immediately ash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals were then transferred onto a goniostat and without delay placed under a stream of dry nitrogen gas at 100 K for data collection. Complete data sets were collected on single, ash-frozen crystals for each of the IDH complexes. All data were collected at the Macromolecular Crystallography Facility on Beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) on a Quantum-4 CCD (charge-coupled device) detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). The raw data from the CCD detector were corrected for dark current by using the software and correction les available at the ALS. Corrected image data were then processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK (14). All data sets had a 2r cutoff applied to their intensities. Molecular replacement solutions were found by using the XPLOR program version 3.851 (15), and the coordinates for the IDH protein chain were from a wild-type enzyme/substrate complex,1AI3 (16). Rigid-body re nement was followed by a single round of simulated annealing re nement, using the slow-cool re nement protocol in XPLOR with 25-K steps and a starting temperature of 4000 K. Initial difference Fourier maps were calculated using the programs XPLOR and CCP4 before any other re nements (15, 17). Electron density maps were observed by using the programs O (18) and SPOCK (19), and all additional re nement protocols were performed with the program XPLOR. All programs were run on a Silicon Graphics Indigo equipped with CrystalEyes (Stereographics ). Individual atomic models for d- and l-isocitrate were built using the Builder Module of InsightII (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). The models were then energy-minimized using XPLOR2D, and the appropriate topology and parameter les were then generated by using the same program (20). After manually building substrates, Mg2 + , sulfate(s), and the glycerol molecules into the corresponding electron density, protein models were further re ned by using positional and individual B-factor renements. The following protocol was then followed for three iterations, or until RFree values were no longer lowered: 1) Difference Fourier maps (Fo ¡ Fc and 2F o ¡ Fc ) were calculated and a water peak search with a 4r cutoff was performed using the program XPLOR; 2) potential water molecule positions were visually checked for available hydrogen bonding, and individual water molecules were then manually placed into position; 3) a series of iterations of positional re nement followed by individual B-factor re nements were performed until the RFree values were minimized. Steps 1 through 3 were repeated until waters could no longer be justi ably added into 3.5r peaks and the RFree values remained constant. After all re nements, each structure was analyzed for geometric quality by using the programs PROCHECK (21), WHATCHECK (22),

and XPLOR (15). Superpositions and root mean square deviations in atomic positions were calculated by using the program InsightII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The x-ray crystallographic data collection, processing, and re nement statistics for the structures of three IDH complexes Ê are summarized in Table 1. The rst structure, solved to 1.85 A 2+ ­ resolution, is that of a Mg d-isocitrate ­ enzyme complex, which formed from a 100 mM racemic d,l-isocitrate solution Ê containing 100 mM metal. The second structure, solved to 1.70 A resolution, is that of an l-isocitrate-enzyme complex, which formed from a 100 mM racemic d,l-isocitrate solution in the abÊ sence of any added metal. The third structure, solved to 1.70 A 2­ resolution, is that of a SO4 enzyme complex, which formed from a solution of pure d-isocitrate in the absence of any added metal. The electron density for the ligands in the active sites of each of the three complexes is shown in Fig. 1, along with a detailed view of the interactions between the ligands and the protein. The electron density is well ordered and unambiguous for each of the ligands and surrounding water molecules in all three complexes. The similarity in the active site structures of the Mg2 + ­ d-isocitrate ­ IDH and l-isocitrate ­ IDH complexes is easily observed in the superimposition of the two structures shown in Fig. 2. As is immediately apparent in the stereoview (Fig. 2a), both d- and l-isocitrate can bind to the active site of IDH, and their positions are almost completely superimposable (Figs. 2b Ê and 2c) to within 1.2 A except for the ­ OH group attached to the C2 carbon. A rough picture of the binding of isocitrate to IDH is shown schematically in Fig. 3, where A, B, and C correspond to the residues ­ Ca OO ¡ , ­ CH(Cb OO ¡ )( ­ CH2 Cc OO ¡ ), and ­ H of the C2 carbon of isocitrate. A0 , B0 , and C0 are used to represent the sites or locations on the protein to which these groups bind. As described in the four-location model (10), group D, the ­ OH group at the C2 carbon, is the group that the enzyme uses to discriminate between the enantiomers by binding to D0 for the d-isomer case and to site D0 0 for the l-enantiomer. Fig. 2b shows clearly that the D group points in opposite directions in the d- and l-isomer complexes and provides the key to the discrimination between the enantiomers. The more detailed relationships between the d- and l-isocitrate complexes are shown in Table 2, which illustrates the actual distances between the groups A, B, and C on the substrates and the protein residues at sites (i.e., locations) A0 , B0 , and C0 . These detailed distances are intriguing because groups A, B, and C of the d-enantiomer bind to the same locations as groups A, B, and C of the l-enantiomer only because they approach sites A0 , B0 , and C0 from opposite directions. If the D groups on each enantiomer were located at or near the same site, it would be improbable for A, B, and C of each enantiomer to interact with the same protein sites A0 , B0 , and C0 . As Table 2 shows, in the Mg2 + ­ d-isocitrate ­ IDH complex, group A on d-isocitrate (the ­ Ca OO ¡ group) forms three hydrogen bonds with arginine residues (Arg119 and Arg129) and one

ionic bond with the divalent metal. In the l-isocitrate ­ IDH complex, group A on l-isocitrate also forms three hydrogen bonds with arginine residues (Arg119, Arg129, and Arg153). The hydrogen bond distances to the arginines residues are, on average and within experimental error, slightly smaller with d-isocitrate Ê (2.72, 2.77, and 3.03 A) than with l-isocitrate (2.72, 2.92, and ÊA, respectively). The major difference between the two 3.26 complexes with respect to the group A and site A0 interaction is that the ionic bond formed between group A and Mg2 + in the Mg2 + ­ d-isocitrate ­ IDH complex is replaced by a weaker Ê hydrogen bond (3.13 A long) between group A and a new water molecule (HOH1) in the l-isocitrate ­ IDH complex. This water molecule is held in position by additional hydrogen bonds to Ê Asp307 (interoxygen [O ­ O] distance 2.90 A) and Asp311 (O ­ O ÊA) and to another new water molecule HOH2 (O ­ O distance 2.98 Ê distance 2.84 A; Figs. 1b and 2a). Water HOH2 occupies a space Ê ­ l-isocitrate complex that was originally 2.53 A away in the IDH ­ Mg2 + ­ d-isocitrate from the delta carbon of Arg129 in the IDH

complex. The Arg129 guanidinium group accommodates the positions of C2S -a -carboxylate group and HOH2 in the IDH ­ lisocitrate complex by a simple rotation. This rotation also allows HOH2 to form a hydrogen bond with Arg153 (O ­ N distance Ê 2.93 A). The recruitment of two water molecules by l-isocitrate allows for the stabilization of active site residues in the absence of metal. For the interaction between the B group, that is, ­ CH(Cb OO ¡ ) ( ­ CH2 Cc OO ¡ ), with the B0 site, seven hydrogen bonds form between the two carboxylates, ­ CH(Cb OO ¡ )( ­ CH2 Cc OO ¡ ), and six amino acid side chains. These interactions are conserved between d- and l-isocitrate and many of the distances remain unchanged within experimental error. However, on average the distances between B and B0 for d-isocitrate are slightly longer than those of l-isocitrate, the largest observed differences beÊ Ê Ê Ê ing 3.29 A versus 2.34 A, and 3.16 A versus 2.87 A. These small difference in position of the B groups between d- and l-isocitrate are shown in Figs. 2b and 2c. A notable observation

(C) A 90 ± rotation of the view in B, revealing the small differences in atomic positions of the C2-carbon atom and of the hydrogen that is transferred to NADP + during the course of the reaction. is that the beta-carboxylate (Cb OO ¡ ) that is eliminated as CO2 during the reaction is superimposable on the carboxyl group of Ê the l isomer structure within experimental error (0.2 A), and the surrounding amino acids that interact with the beta-carboxylate are also superimposable to within experimental error. The locations of group C (i.e., the H ¡ or hydogen that is transferred as a hydride during the reaction) are also very similar for both d- and l-isocitrate. The hydrogens are superimposable to Ê within 0.9 A and they are both in orientations favorable for the stereospeci c reduction of the C0 site; that is, NADP + on the A-face of the nicotinamide ring (23). Although the hydrogen does not make any direct interactions with protein groups or Ê water molecules, the location of this C group is within » 4.1 A 0 of the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring; that is, C , when modeled onto a structure of an IDH ternary complex (16, 24). Note that the term "location" does not necessarily imply that an interaction exists, but it does indicate that the location of a speci c group is important for a speci c function (e.g., the orientation for hydride transfer). Perhaps the small shift seen in the hydride position between d- and l-isocitrate would be suf cient to decrease the rate of hydride transfer and hence explain the inactivity of the l-enantiomer (16). However, a more likely explanation is that the ­ OH group of l-isocitrate is in an orientation that is unfavorable for catalysis to take place.

Figure 3. Four-point location model for stereoselectivity of a protein. (A) A model representing a protein that could provide two groups (D0 and D0 0 ) in either of two locations that could interact with group D on a chiral carbon atom. The protein may use D0 to bind one enantiomer and it may use D0 0 to bind the other enantiomer. This model describes the stereoselectivity of E. coli IDH (B), in which the enzyme can bind and catalyze the physiological d-enantiomer of isocitrate only when the divalent metal (D0 ) is present in the enzyme active site. In its absence, the enzyme binds the inactive l-enantiomer of isocitrate by interactions involving Arg119 (D0 0 ). The locations of group D, the ­ OH group, are in completely opposite directions for d- and l-isocitrate (Figs. 2a and 2b). Group D for d-isocitrate in the presence of Mg2 + forms a number of strong interactions with site D0 , which is composed of Mg2 + , Lys230 0 , Asp283 0 , Asp307 and a water molecule HOH* (Table 2). Group D for l-isocitrate in the absence of Mg2 + forms interactions with site D0 0 , which consists of a single amino acid (Arg129) and a single water molecule, HOH3 (Figs. 1b and 2a). Thus, the enantiomeric selection for d- and l-isocitrate comes from the location of the fourth group D and its interaction with a fourth site, either D0 or D0 0 . The selection between the two enantiomers is weighted toward which location, D0 or D0 0 , can provide the greatest binding energy. The provisions for binding energy by locations D0 or D0 0 for group D are witnessed by the following experimental facts. First, when a racemic mixture of d- and l-isocitrate is placed in a test tube with Mg2 + ion, the d-isomer is metabolized and the l-isomer is untouched. Second, as shown in the simulation of velocity curves for d-isocitrate in the presence of equal concentrations of inhibitory l-isocitrate with use of hypothesized values for KI , l-isocitrate would have no observable inhibitory effect on the binding and kinetics of d -isocitrate unless its K I was within » 5 times the K M value of d-isocitrate (Fig. 4). The experimental data indicate that the K I value for l-isocitrate is > 50 times that of the K M value of d -isocitrate (Fig. 4). In the crystallization of the apoenzyme in the presence of the racemic mixture and in the absence of metal, only the l-isocitrate binds, indicating that the l-isomer binds at least 20 times more tightly than the d-isomer. Essentially no electron density for the d-enantiomer of isocitrate was observed in (Fo ¡ Fc )a calc difference maps contoured to 1.5r , even though d-isocitrate is in the crystal soak at a concentration equal to that of l-isocitrate (100 mM). Moreover, there is no observable electron density peak for Mg2 + in the active site, indicating that essentially all divalent metal ions were successfully removed with the chelexing resin surrounding the crystal. From these results it seems clear that the metal ion not only has a major in uence in attracting the OH group of C2, but also plays a major role in stabilizing the interaction between the enzyme and the d-isomer more powerfully than the l-isomer. In the absence of metal, the l-isomer is preferentially bound over the d-isomer and the orientation of the D group ( ­ OH) of the l-isomer is » 180 ± away from the metal ion complex. This cannot result from any steric blocking because all the ingredients are the same except the metal ion. Thus, the d-isomer could bind to the apoenzyme in the same orientation as occurs in the

(A) The kinetic response of E. coli IDH to increasing concentrations of pure d-isocitrate (solid squares) and d-isocitrate in a racemic d,l-isocitrate mix (open triangles).

In fact, in an experiment in which the apoenzyme was exposed to pure d-isocitrate in the absence of metal, d-isocitrate bound so weakly that only SO2¡ was bound to any noticeable 4 concentration in the enzyme active site (Table 2 and Fig. 1c). In the presence of metal, this sulfate molecule can be competed out by the presence of metal and d-isocitrate (Fig. 1a) (25). The different binding geometry of the d- and l-isocitrate observed in the x-ray structures presented emphasizes the importance of the location of each of the four groups (A, B, C, and D) attached to the C2 chiral carbon and the interaction sites or locations for each of these groups (A0 , B0 , C0 , and D0 or D0 0 ) (10). Because the A, B and C groups on the chiral atom bind well to the A0 , B0 and C0 sites of the protein whether they approach from left or right (Fig. 3), it is clear that three points of attachment is insuf cient for discriminating between isomers; instead, the location of the fourth group, D, is essential for that discrimination. Moreover, the course of evolution seems to be revealed. Because there are no precursors or breakdown products of the l-enantiomer, it seems likely that evolution selectively optimized the ef ciency of the d-isomer in relation to both binding and reactivity in the presence of metal; the l-isomer can fortuitously bind to the enzyme very weakly by binding to the same three sites in an opposite orientation. It does so because all the same bonds can be formed in the opposite orientation, but the catalytic groups are not oriented for reaction and the inactive isomer binds so weakly it does not hinder the physiological reaction.
