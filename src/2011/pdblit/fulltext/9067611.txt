The recombinant N-terminal 107-amino acid polypeptide fragment 2­108 of the DnaJ molecular chaperone of Escherichia coli, which contains the J-domain (residues 2 to 76) and the Gly/Phe-rich region (residues 77 to 108), was uniformly labeled with nitrogen-15 and carbon-13. The complete NMR solution structure of the J-domain was determined with the program DIANA on the basis of 682 nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) upper distance limits and 180 dihedral angle constraints. It contains three well-defined helices comprising residues 6 to 10, 18 to 32 and 41 to 57, and a fourth helix, consisting of residues 61 to 68, which is well defined as a regular secondary structure but for which the location relative to the remainder of the molecule is not precisely determined. The helices II and III form an antiparallel helical coiled-coil. Helix I is approximately parallel to the plane defined by the helices II and III and runs from the carboxy-terminal end of the helix III to the center of helix II. Helix IV is positioned near the carboxy-terminal end of helix III and is on the same side of the coiled coil as helix I, but it is oriented approximately perpendicular to the plane of the helices II and III. This novel a-protein topology leads to formation of a hydrophobic core involving side-chains of all four helices. A strong correlation is seen between the extent of sequence-conservation of hydrophobic residues in the family of J-domain homologues, and the structural organization of the hydrophobic core in these proteins. The residues which have key roles for the specificity of the interaction of DnaJ-like proteins with their corresponding Hsp70 counterparts are located on the outer surfaces of the helices II and III, and in the loop connecting these two helices. Measurements of backbone amide proton exchange rates, 15N spin relaxation times and heteronuclear 15N {1H} NOEs provided additional insights into local conformational equilibria and internal rate processes in DnaJ(2­108). In the Gly/Phe-rich region, which is poorly ordered in the NMR solution structure and does not form a globular core, the polypeptide segment 90 to 103 differs from the segments 77 to 89 and 104 to 108 by reduced local flexibility. Considering that this same segment shows sequence conservation with corresponding segments in the Gly/Phe-rich regions of other DnaJ-like proteins, its

Introduction
The DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE molecular chaperone machine participates in a variety of biological processes such as protein folding, protein disaggregation, survival at high temperature, negative regulation of the heat shock response, modulation of in vivo proteolysis rates, and replication of several plasmids (reviewed by Georgopoulos et al., 1990; Georgopoulos & Welch, 1993). Central to the mechanism of action of this chaperone machine is that DnaJ stimulates the hydrolysis of DnaK-bound ATP (Liberek et al., 1991) which, in turn, regulates the affinity of DnaK for substrates such as s32 (Liberek & Georgopoulos, 1993). Furthermore, Kimura et al. (1995) have recently shown that Ydj1, a eukaryotic DnaJ-like protein, interacts with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 in establishing several signal pathways, presumably by facilitating critical changes in protein conformation/oligomerization that are required for signal transduction. In the full length Escherichia coli DnaJ protein there are four domains formed by the 376-amino acid sequence. An amino-terminal 108-residue fragment of DnaJ, represented in this study by DnaJ(2­108), is sufficient to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK, regulate the conformational state and substrate binding of DnaK in the presence of ATP, support l phage replication as well as down-regulate the heat shock response in vivo (Liberek et al., 1995; Wall et al., 1994, 1995). However, this fragment does not bind polypeptide substrates. The amino-terminal 76 residues of DnaJ form an evolutionarily highly conserved motif, the ``J-domain'', which basically defines the family of DnaJ-like proteins (Bork et al., 1992; Silver & Way, 1993). The adjoining Gly/Phe-rich region, comprising residues 77 to 108, contains a large number of glycyl and phenylalanyl residues. Deletion of residues 77 to 108 leads to a mutant protein that still binds to DnaK and stimulates its ATPase activity at wild-type levels, but is defective in activating DnaK to bind s32. This indicates that the Gly/Phe-rich region has an essential role in modulating the substrate-binding activity of DnaK (Wall et al., 1995). Carboxy-terminal to these modules, there are a ``zinc-binding'' and a ``low homology'' region, which are also present in many other DnaJ-like proteins. To obtain further insight into the structural basis of DnaJ functions, we determined the three-dimensional structure of DnaJ(2­108) by NMR spectroscopy. Preliminary data showed that the J-domain consists of four a-helices, where the

global fold is characterized by an antiparallel arrangement of the helices II and III, with the helices I and IV oriented approximately perpendicular to II and III (Szyperski et al., 1994a). The same fold was also reported for a different construct, DnaJ(1­78) (Hill et al., 1995), which represents the complete J-domain but is not biochemically active. In contrast to the J-domain, the Gly/Phe-rich region was found to be flexibly disordered in solution (Szyperski et al., 1994a). Here we describe the complete, high-quality NMR solution structure determination of the J-domain supplemented by studies of its internal mobility through measurements of the 15N spin relaxation times. In view of the important role of the Gly-Phe-rich region for the biological function of DnaJ, we further include a characterization of the structural and dynamic properties of residues 77 to 108 by measurements of the amide proton exchange rates and 15N spin relaxation parameters.

Results
Resonance assignments Sequence-specific NMR assignments for DnaJ(2­ 108) were obtained based in part on establishing sequential NOE connectivities (Billeter et al., 1982; Wagner & Wuthrich, 1982; Wuthrich, 1986) with 3D ¨ ¨ 15 N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (Fesik & Zuiderweg, 1988; Messerle et al., 1989) and 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] TOCSY (Fesik & Zuiderweg, 1988), and in part on heteronuclear scalar coupling connectivities established using 3D Ha/bCa/b(CO)NHN (Szyperski et al., 1994b) and 3D CBCANHN (Grzesiek & Bax, 1992) spectra. Combination of the results from the two approaches yielded nearly complete assignments for the back bone 1HN and 15N resonances and the aCH-bCHn fragments. The only missing backbone assignments are those of the NH moieties of the N-terminal Ala2, and of Lys3, and all resonances of the five glycyl residues 81, 82, 86, 104 and 105, which could not be assigned because of degeneracy of the 1H, 15N and 13Ca chemical shifts. The chemical shifts of the aCH-bCHn fragments provided the starting point for the 1H and 13C assignments of the aliphatic side-chains with 3D HCCH-TOCSY (Bax et al., 1990) and 3D HCCHCOSY (Kay et al., 1990). Complete assignments for the aliphatic CHn moieties were obtained, except that Arg22 d13C, Arg27 d13C, Arg63 g13C, Arg108 d13C, and all 13C resonances and the g- and d-proton resonances of Arg106 could not be identified due to spectral overlap. Among the labile side-chain

238 protons, the amide groups of all Asn and Gln, and the Arg108 e-proton resonance were assigned. Stereospecific assignments were obtained for 13 out of 35 bCH2 groups with non-degenerate b-proton shifts, and for the isopropyl methyls of Val12, Val56 and Leu57. The 1H spin systems of the aromatic rings of the tyrosyl and phenylalanyl residues in the J-domain were identified using 2D 13C(v2 )-halffiltered [1H, 1H] TOCSY (Otting & Wuthrich, 1990). ¨ Subsequently, these resonances were sequentially assigned via NOEs between the aromatic ring and the b- and/or a-protons (Wuthrich, 1986), using 3D ¨ 13 C-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (Ikura et al., 1990) and 2D 13C(v2 )-half-filtered [1H, 1H] NOESY (Otting & Wuthrich, 1990). Likewise, the d-protons of the ¨ phenylalanyl residues in the Gly/Phe-rich region (residues 77 to 108) were assigned using 3D 13 C-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY. Since all these resonances have virtually identical chemical shifts, assignments of the corresponding e and z-protons could not be obtained. The 13C assignments for the tyrosyl rings were obtained from the proton chemical shifts using a 2D ct-[13C, 1H] COSY spectrum (Vuister & Bax, 1992). The 13C resonances of the phenylalanyl residues in the Gly/Phe-rich region could not be assigned because of spectral overlap. The aromatic resonances of His33 and His71 were identified using 2D ct-[13C, 1H] COSY, but sequential assignments were not obtained because the NOEs between the rings and the aCH-bCH2 moieties could not be detected. This may be rationalized on the basis of the NMR solution structure (see below): both histidine imidazole moieties are solvent-exposed and flexibly disordered. Overall, the analysis of the two and three-dimensional spectra for resonances of the structured J-domain was not severely affected by the presence of the more flexible Gly/Phe-rich region. Most of the resonance lines of residues 77 to 108 are not as sharp and intense as one would expect for a fully flexible random coil polypeptide segment, so that there were no pronounced truncation or cancellation artifacts in the NMR spectra. DnaJ(2­108) exhibits only very limited proton chemical shift dispersion, as is typically observed for a-helical proteins. Because of this and the fact that the Gly-Phe-rich region is predominantly disordered, 13C/15N labeling was mandatory for obtaining complete assignments. Outstanding proton chemical shifts are those of Ha of Lys14 and Ala53, which deviate by more than 1.0 ppm from their random coil values. The calculation of ring current effects arising from aromatic side-chains (Perkins & Wuthrich, 1979) showed that these large ¨ shifts originate almost entirely from close spatial proximity of the two a-protons to the rings of Tyr7 and Tyr6, respectively. Collection of conformational constraints As outlined by Szyperski et al. (1994a) the Gly-Phe-rich region is disordered in the NMR

solution structure, and only intraresidual and sequential NOEs were observed for this polypeptide segment. Therefore, we restricted the structure calculation to the J-domain of residues 2 to 76. Within the J-domain, 548 NOEs from 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (100 ms mixing time) and 1142 NOEs from 13C-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (70 ms mixing time) were assigned. In addition 55 3JHNa coupling constants were extracted by inverse Fourier transformation of in-phase multiplets from a 2D [15N, 1H] COSY spectrum (Szyperski et al., 1992), 14 3JNb coupling constants were estimated from 3D ct-HNNHB (Archer et al., 1991; Chary et al., 1991), and 16 3Jab coupling constants were estimated from 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] TOCSY (50 ms mixing time) for residues with 3JHNa < 6.0 Hz

(Clore et al., 1991). The resulting input for the final DIANA structure calculation contained 682 NOE upper distance limits (310 intraresidual, 80 sequential backbone­backbone, 34 medium-range and long-range backbone­backbone, 258 interresidual with side-chain protons) and 180 dihedral angle constraints. Figure 1(a) shows the sequence distribution of the NOEs observed for the J-domain. Although a rather uniform distribution of longrange NOE constraints was observed for the helices I, II and III, only a few long-range constraints were obtained for helix IV. In addition, no long-range NOEs were observed either for the loop comprising residues 34 to 40, or for the N-terminal and C-terminal residues of the J-domain. The NMR solution structure of the J-domain The tertiary fold of the J-domain (residues 2 to 76) is essentially that described previously by Szyperski et al. (1994a), except that the lengths of the helical secondary structures are slightly different. The relative orientation of the first three a-helices, comprising residues 6 to 10, 18 to 32 and 41 to 57, is well-defined, but for the fourth helix, comprising residues 61 to 68, the spatial orientation with respect to the remainder of the molecule could not be precisely determined (Figure 1(b)). The helices II and III form an antiparallel helical coiled-coil. Helix I is approximately parallel to a plane containing the helices II and III and runs from the carboxy-terminal end of helix III toward the center of helix II. Helix IV near the carboxy-terminal end of helix III is on the same side of the helices II and III, as helix I, but is oriented approximately perpendicular to the plane containing the helices II and III (Figure 3). Helices I and II are connected by a tight turn; the amide proton of Ala16 exchanges slowly and a hydrogen bond between this amide group and the carbonyl oxygen of Ser13 has been identified (see below), but the structural determination for this polypeptide segment is not sufficiently precise (Figure 1(b)) to unambiguously identify the type of the turn. Similarly, the loop of residues 34 to 40, which connects the helices II and III, and the turn of residues 58 to 60, which links the helices III and IV, are not defined with high precision (Figure 1(b)).

An overview of the results of the structure calculation, after energy minimization of the DIANA conformers, is provided by Table 1. The small size and number of residual constraint violations show that the input data represent a self-consistent set, and that the constraints are well satisfied in the calculated conformers. The mean of the local backbone displacements (Figure 1(b)), as well as a plot of the f and c-angles observed in the 20 energy-refined DIANA conformers versus the sequence (Figure 2), shows that all four helices of the J-domain are locally well defined in the NMR structure. However, calculation of the r.m.s.d.

Figure 3. Two views of a schematic drawing of the polypeptide segment comprising the residues 2 to 76 of the DIANA conformer with the lowest residual target function value. The four a-helices are drawn as red and yellow ribbons, and the intervening turns and loops as grey tubes. The same structure is shown in (a) and (b); the two views differ by a rotation of approximately 90° about a vertical axis in the projection plane. In (a) some a-carbon positions are identified by the one-letter amino acid code and the sequence number. The Figure was generated with the program MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996).

values for the different atom selections (Table 2) shows that the location of helix IV is globally significantly less well defined when compared with the first three helices. Technically, the increased global disorder for helix IV is due to the fact that we could observe long-range NOEs only for the three residues Lys62, Arg63 and Tyr66 in this helix (Figure 1(a)). This scarcity of long-range NOEs is due to the particular packing geometry of helix IV with respect to the remainder of the molecule, as is evidenced by the fact that in the final structure ° there are no distances shorter than 4.0 A with hydrogen atoms of helix IV, for which the corresponding NOEs were not observed. Furthermore, increased local disorder (Figures 1(b) and 2)

is observed for all turns and loops connecting the helices, and for the N and C-terminal polypeptide segments. Inspection of the dihedral angle distribution (Figure 2) and the hydrogen bonds (Table 3) observed for the J-domain reveals that Asp5, Glu17 and Asp40 form N-caps (Richardson & Richardson, 1988) of helices I, II and III, respectively. For Asp5 the side-chain hydrogen bond is formed with the backbone amide proton of the sequentially following residue, which is rarely observed for longer helices (Richardson & Richardson, 1988). The carboxyl oxygen of Glu17 is hydrogen bonded with the backbone amide proton of Arg19, thus interacting with the second residue of helix II. A remarkable conformation is observed for the N-cap of helix III, Asp40, in that one of its side-chain carboxyl oxygen atoms forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the backbone amide protons of Lys41 and Ala43 (Figure 4). The NMR structure determination leads to a static picture; therefore there remains the open question whether the side-chain carboxylate of Asp40 might actually form a ``time-shared'' hydrogen bond (Szyperski et al., 1994c) with the amide protons of Lys41 and Ala43. Similarly, the side-chain carboxylates of Asp5 as well as Asp59, which is properly located to act as the N-cap of helix IV, might form time-shared hydrogen bonds with the amide protons of Tyr7 and Glu8, and Gln61 and Lys62, respectively. Unfortunately, recording of 2D [15N, 1H] COSY spectra at different pH values revealed that DnaJ(2­108) is highly sensitive to acid denaturation and irreversibly unfolds at pH values below 4.5. It was thus not possible to further document these putative time-shared hydrogen bonds by pHtitration experiments. The antiparallel arrangement of the helices II and III resembles a two-stranded a-helical coiled-coil. The angle between the axes of two cylinders representing the helices II and III is about 20° (Figure 3), which is typical of a super-coil in which the hydrophobic contact surface between the two

241 and g' possess charged side-chains or are alanyl residues. The spatial association of helix I with the helices II and III leads to the formation of a well defined hydrophobic core (Figure 6): the average r.m.s.d. value relative to the mean structure calculated after superposition of the helices I to III amounts to ° 1.10 A for all heavy atoms (Table 2). The sidechains of Ile9, Leu10, Val12, Ile21, Ala53 and Leu57 are located at the intersection of the helices I, II and III, and constitute the central part of the hydrophobic core. Directly associated are Tyr25 and Tyr54 at the interface between the helices II and III, and Tyr6, Tyr7 and Val56, which are oriented towards helix IV. Furthermore, Ala24, Ala 29 and Ala45 are peripherally attached to the hydrophobic cluster, and the helix IV contacts the core of the molecule near Tyr6 and Val56 through Tyr66. Studies of conformational equilibria and internal rate processes in DnaJ(2­108) by measurement of backbone amide proton exchange rates and 15N spin relaxation parameters Exchange rates of slowly exchanging amide protons were obtained from a series of 2D [15N, 1H] COSY spectra recorded immediately after fully protonated, 15N-labeled DnaJ(2­108) was dissolved in 2H2 O. In addition, exchange rates for more rapidly exchanging backbone amide protons were determined with a series of MEXICO experiments (Gemmecker et al., 1993). The combined use of both approaches allowed measurement of exchange rates covering the two ranges 7.7 × 10-6 to 2.1 × 10-3 s-1 and 1.4 to 32.7 s-1, and all the rates in DnaJ(2­108) which were not detected by either of the two experimental approaches could be attributed to the range from 1 × 10-2 s-1 to 1 s-1 (Figure 7). Following the general considerations by Liepinsh et al. (1992) in connection with protein hydration studies, special care was used in the analysis of seryl and threonyl residues to account for exchange effects between the amide and the hydroxyl groups. For example, the backbone amide proton of Thr58 manifests slow exchange in the 1 H/2H exchange measurements, but also gives rise to a cross-peak in the MEXICO experiments. The peak in the MEXICO experiment must thus be due to an intraresidual NOE between the backbone amide proton and the hydroxyl proton, which exchanges more rapidly with the solvent water (Wuthrich, 1986). We could thus not a priori exclude ¨ that the amide protons of Ser13, Thr15, and Ser91, all of which are observable in the MEXICO experiments but could not be observed immediately after dissolving the protein in 2H2 O, actually exchange with a rate in the intermediate range 1 × 10-2 s-1 to 1 s-1. For tyrosyl residues the occurrence of a NOE between the hydroxyl group and its own amide protein is sterically unlikely, but additional spurious rapid exchange could be due to

NH and O' identify the backbone amide proton and the carbonyl oxygen atom, respectively, Od and Oe identify the side-chain carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp and Glu, respectively. Backbone amide protons that exchange with a rate <2 × 10-3 s-1 with the solvent are underlined, while amide protons exchanging in the intermediate range from 1 × 10-2 to 1.0 s-1 are marked with an asterisk (see also Figure 7). b This column lists the number of energy-refined DIANA conformers in which the hydrogen bond was identified. The criteria used for the identification of a hydrogen bond are that ° the proton-acceptor distance must be less than 2.4 A, and the angle between the donor-proton bond and the line connecting the acceptor and donor heavy atoms less than 35°. This criterion is sufficiently permissive to detect bifurcated hydrogen bonds.

Figure 4. Stereo view of the polypeptide segment Asp40-Lys41-Glu42-Ala43. Oxygen, nitrogen and backbone amide protons are displayed in red, blue and white, respectively. Other atoms are grey. One of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of the N-cap of helix III, Asp40, forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond, depicted in green, with the backbone amide protons of Lys41 and Ala43.

close spatial proximity between amide and hydroxyl groups in the three-dimensional protein structure. Analysis of the 20 energy-refined DIANA conformers shows that only the backbone amide ° protons of Lys14 and Gln61 are located within 4.0 A of hydroxyl protons, i.e. those of Ser13 and Ser60, respectively. However, these two amide protons exchange sufficiently slowly to be observed by 1 H/2H exchange, and no signals indicative of NOEs with the hydroxyl groups were observed in the MEXICO experiments. The backbone amide protons of the residues in the helices I to III which form the hydrophobic core of the J-domain, exhibit the slowest exchange rates (Figure 7). In comparison, relatively fast exchange rates are observed for the amide protons of helix IV, the residues 29 to 33 of helix II and the residues 41 to 44 of helix III. The backbone amide protons of the loop connecting the helices II and III exchange rapidly, whereas in the turn between the helices I and II the backbone amide protons of Lys14 and Ala16 exchange slowly. The backbone amide proton of Ala16 is involved in a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Ser13 (Table 3), and the protection observed for the amide proton of Lys14 is probably due to formation of a hydrogen bond

The residues of a given heptad repeat (McLachlan & Stewart, 1975) are denoted a to g for helix II, and a' to g' fro helix III.

with the side-chain oxygen of Ser13, which, however, was identified in only 4 of the 20 energy-refined DIANA conformers and is therefore not listed in Table 3. Comparison of Figures 7 and 8 shows that the amide proton exchange rates correlate with the local precision of the NMR structure determination in that slow exchange prevails for the segments which are determined with the highest precision (see also Figure 1(b)). There is also good agreement with the hydrogen bonding pattern observed for the NMR structure of the J-domain (Table 3), since with the sole exceptions of Tyr6, Arg19, and Ala72 all hydrogenbonded amide protons have readily measurable protection factors. The analysis of the MEXICO data on rapidly exchanging amide protons provides further insight into the conformational properties of the Gly/Pherich region. Figure 7 shows that we could not detect significant amide proton protection factors for any of the residues in this region (the protection factors are smaller than 7 throughout), which is in agreement with the earlier observation that the Gly/Phe-rich region adopts predominantly an extended disordered conformation (Szyperski et al., 1994a). To complement the implicit indication of local conformational equilibria by the variable precision of the structure determination along the polypeptide chain and by the amide proton exchange rates (Figures 1(b), 2, 7 and 8) with information on the frequencies of associated rate processes, we further measured T1 , T2 and T1r spin relaxation times for 15 N, and steady-state 15N41H5 NOEs for 15N-labeled DnaJ(2­108). From the T1 /T2 ratio of the helical residues of the J domain (Figure 9), an overall rotational correlation time for DnaJ(2­108) of approximately 6 ns was obtained, using the assumption that the protein reorients isotropically in solution. Within the J-domain (residues 2 to 76), some increased values of T2 in the loop linking the helices II and III, and for the chain-terminal

Figure 6. Two views of a stereo drawing of the hydrophobic core of the J-domain. The backbone of the polypeptide segment 6 to 69 and the side-chain heavy atoms of the residues forming the core of the molecule are shown. Some side-chain positions are identified with the one-letter amino acid code and the sequence numbers. The backbone atoms of the four a-helices are colored in blue. Side-chain heavy atoms are shown in yellow. (b) is the same as (a) after a rotation of approximately 90° about a horizontal axis in the projection plane.

segments reveal the presence of higher-frequency rate processes characterized by correlation times in the ns to ps time range, which is also supported by the observed 15N41H5 NOE values (Figure 9). Furthermore, a very short T2 value for Asp35 shows that additional slow conformational exchange processes are present in the loop between the helices II and III. Although the positioning of helix IV in the NMR structure is less well defined than that of the helices I to III (Figure 1(b) and 8, Table 2),

the relaxation data provide no evidence for local rate processes involving helix IV. We conclude that the poor precision of the structure determination near helix IV arises as a consequence of the scarcity of long-range NOE distance constraints (Figure 1(a)) rather than because of dynamic disorder. The 15N relaxation data (Figure 9) show that the Gly/Phe-rich region reorients with an effective correlation time which is significantly shorter than the correlation time for overall rotational tumbling

Figure 7. The measured rates of backbone amide proton exchange with the solvent at pH 6.2 and 28°C (open squares) are plotted versus the amino acid sequence of DnaJ2(2­108). The intrinsic backbone amide proton exchange rates estimated as described by Bai et al. (1993). are similarly displayed as filled circles. Data points at log kex = -1 inside the shaded area represent residues exhibiting an ``intermediate exchange rate'' in the range from 1 × 10-2 s-1 to 1 s-1 (see the text). The locations of the a-helices in the J-domain and the Gly/Phe-rich region are indicated at the bottom.

of the molecule. The data also show that the polypeptide segments of residues 83 to 90 and 104 to 108 reorient with an effective correlation time that approaches the extreme motional narrowing limit. In contrast, the polypeptide segment of residues 90 to 103 has a significantly longer correlation time. Using the assumption that the backbone amide groups reorient isotropically in solution, the T1 /T2 ratios measured for the residues 90 to 103 yield effective correlation times of about 1­2 ns. This polypeptide segment thus does not have the properties of a typical unstructured ``random coil'', but must adopt preferential conformations in solution which reorient with increased, ``non-random'' effective correlation times in solution. The fact that these implicated conformational preferences are not evidenced either by the NOE data or by the chemical shifts leads further to the following conclusions: (1) These preferred conformations are either predominantly extended, or all except the intraresidual and sequential NOEs are effectively quenched by the local mobility. (2) There must be fast exchange on the chemical shift time scale between multiple preferred conformations, so that conformation-dependent shifts are averaged out. To establish a lower limit on the rate of these exchange processes, we performed additional measurements of rotating frame 15N spin relaxation times with two different spin-lock power levels of 6978 rad s-1 and 12,868 rad s-1. The fact that no variation of T1r with the spin-lock power could be observed establishes an upper limit of 100 ms for effective correlation times that would be dominated

A spline function was drawn through the Ca positions, and the thickness of the cylindrical rod is proportional to the bb mean of the global displacements, Dglob , of the 20 energy-minimized DIANA conformers calculated after superposition of the heavy atom N, Ca and C' of all helical residues for minimal r.m.s.d.

Discussion
The three-dimensional structure of the J-domain represents a novel folding topology for an aprotein. Sequence alignment of the J-domain with the sequences of all three-dimensional protein structures available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) did not identify any sequence that exhibits more than 25% homology. Moreover, the distance matrix algorithm of Holm & Sander (1993) implemented in the program DALI revealed no topological similarities with any of the 599 protein chains currently used to represent the contents of the Protein Data Bank in this context (Holm & Sander, 1994). The J-domain from the E. coli DnaJ chaperone very likely represents the three-dimensional fold of a large number of homologous J-domain from widely different origins. A sequence alignment with 50 J-domains (21 from bacteria, 9 from yeasts, 20 from other eukaryotes) revealed a striking

correlation between the conservation of hydrophobic residues and their structural roles in the hydrophobic cluster (Figure 6; see also Szyperski et al., 1994a). The packing of the conserved residues Tyr6, Tyr7, Ile9, Leu10 and Leu57 leaves a small cavity that accommodates the methyl group of the highly conserved residue Ala53 (Figure 6(b)). In Sec63-1, a J-domain-like protein which interacts with Kar2 (Hsp70) in protein transport and folding in the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum of yeast, the substitution Ala179 : Thr, which corresponds to a mutation at position 53 in E. coli DnaJ and likely results in a perturbation of the hydrophobic cluster, leads to a thermolabile phenotype (Nelson et al., 1993). Furthermore, due to the spatial restriction, other substitutions at position 53 provoke size-compensatory mutations for the five surrounding residues (Figure 6(b)) in order to preserve the scaffold of the J-domain. For example, in the J-domain of the SV40 T-antigen, the substitution Ala53 : Leu occurred in concert with Tyr6 : Leu and Leu57 : Met (the residue numbers are those for the DnaJ J-domain of E. coli ). The antiparallel coiled-coil formed by the helices II and III is stabilized by interchain hydrophobic interactions between apolar residues situated at positions a and d of the heptad repeats of Figure 5. Accordingly, Tyr25, Tyr32, Phe47 and Tyr54 at positions a and a' are almost invariably aromatic,

and Ile21, Leu28, Ile50 and Leu57 at positions d and d ' are invariably hydrophobic in the different J-domain sequences. High levels of conservation are also observed for Lys62, Arg63 and Tyr66, which are located in helix IV and constitute its interface to the remainder of the J-domain, and for Val12, which contacts the helices I and II. In contrast, Ala24, Ala29, Met30 and Ala45 of DnaJ, which are not conserved as hydrophobic residues in other J-domain sequences, are only peripherally associated with the hydrophobic cluster (Figure 6; see also Figure 5 of Szyperski et al., 1994a). Furthermore, lack of conservation in the polypeptide segment 41 to 45, which constitutes the amino-terminal part of helix III, reflects the fact this segment is at best marginally involved in the formation of the hydrophobic core (Figure 6(a)). Recent mutational studies provide evidence that some of the solvent-exposed side-chains occupying the positions b, c and f of the heptad repeats (Figure 5) have crucial roles for the interaction of J-domains with Hsp70-like proteins. Schlenstedt et al. (1995) have shown that swapping of the J-domain between Sis1p or Mdj1p and Sec63p leads to non-functional chimeric proteins. However, by additional mutations of the J-domain of Sis1p in the positions corresponding to Arg19, Lys23 and Lys48 of the E. coli DnaJ-domain (Figure 10), a fully functional Sec63p fusion protein containing the mutant Sis1p J-domain could be obtained. Remark-

246 ably, we find that Met30 in E. coli DnaJ represents a solvent-exposed hydrophobic residue in an f position of helix II (Figures 5 and 10), although a charge or polar side-chain would be energetically more favorable. This observation suggests that Met30 could also play a significant role for the specificity of the DnaJ-DnaK interaction. There is ample evidence that the tripeptide segment His33­Pro34­Asp35, which is universally conserved among the J-domain sequences, plays an essential role in the interactions of DnaJ-like proteins with their Hsp70 counterparts (Bork et al., 1992; Kelley & Landry, 1994): First, these interactions are completely abolished by the point mutation His33 : Gln in E. coli DnaJ (Wall et al., 1994). Second, Feldheim et al. (1992) showed for Sec63 that amino acid substitutions in positions which are homologous to Pro34 and Asp35 of E. coli DnaJ result in an inactive protein. Third, mutations in the His­Pro­Asp segment of the SV40 T-antigen result in mutant phenotypes (Kelley & Landry, 1994). In the NMR structure of the E. coli DnaJ J-domain this tripeptide segment is located in a flexibly disordered loop (Figure 1(b), 8 and 9) which is not part of the structural core of the protein. The implication then is that the high degree of conservation of this tripeptide segment is related to its functional role for the specific protein-protein interactions of DnaJ-like proteins with their Hsp70 counterparts (Szyperski et al., 1994a). The slow rate processes observed for this loop (Figure 9(b)) would make this structure element a good candidate for an ``induced-fit'' mechanism in the interactions with the Hsp70 proteins. Overall, the aforementioned apparent structure­ function correlations show that both affinity and selectivity of a particular J-domain to its Hsp70 partner (DnaK in E. coli ) are mainly determined by specific interactions that involve residues located in the loop connecting the helices II and III and on the outer surfaces of the helices II and III (Figure 10). In this context it is then of interest that the helices II and III are too short to independently form a typical, stable antiparallel coiled-coil, since formation of this structure type would require longer helices consisting of at least three heptad repeats (see Lau et al., 1984). It is thus tempting to speculate that the main function of the helices I and IV is to stabilize the antiparallel coiled-coil arrangement of the helices II and III, which in turn represent the scaffold for proper spatial positioning of residues that determine and modulate the interactions with Hsp70. The comparatively low precision of the NMR structure determination for helix IV (Figures 1(b) and 8) is due to the fact that it is connected with the hydrophobic core of the molecule almost solely via Tyr66. This rather loose ``docking'' indicates an alternative possible mechanism for fine regulation of the function of the J-domain in that, depending on the positioning of helix IV, the directly adjoining domains might adopt different spatial arrangements relative to the core of the J-domain. This could be particularly important for those J-domain

proteins which do not possess the Gly/Phe-rich region located immediately carboxy-terminal to the J-domain. Ample evidence exists to suggest that the Gly-Phe-rich region may have auxilary functions to those of the J-domain. For example, it is known that deletion of residues 77 to 108 in E. coli DnaJ results in a mutant protein that interacts with DnaK and polypeptide substrates with wild-type affinities, but is defective in its ability to activate DnaK to bind substrates (Wall et al., 1995). Within the Gly/Phe-rich region, the polypeptide segment comprising residues 92 to 102 shares high sequence homology with corresponding segments in the Gly-Phe-rich regions of other DnaJ-like proteins (Figure 1 of Wall et al., 1995). In the case of E. coli DnaJ, the characteristic tripeptide sequence, Asp-Ile/Val-Phe, is repeated three times in this 11-amino acid segment. In view of the absence of a structural role in the molecular architecture, the high conservation of residues 92 to 102 suggests that they must be important for the function of DnaJ (Wall et al., 1995). In this context it is intriguing that the present NMR investigation shows that the polypeptide segment 90 to 103, which covers the conserved polypeptide segment, does not correspond to a flexible extended ``random coil'' but undergoes rapid exchange between different locally preferred conformations. This finding is of special interest with regard to the hypothesis that the Gly-Phe-rich region participates directly in the formation of a ternary DnaJ-DnaK-polypeptide complex (Wall et al., 1995). Conformational preferences in the unbound state, which could also include transient contacts of this polypeptide segment with the J-domain, would reduce the partition function of this region, and the correspondingly reduced entropy loss upon binding of DnaJ to DnaK would eventually contribute to the stability of the ternary complex.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation
13 C/15N doubly-labeled DnaJ(2­108) was prepared as described by Szyperski et al. (1994a). To obtain uniformly 15 N-labeled DnaJ(2­108) the E. coli expression strain DW531 grown in 100 ml Isogro medium culture was used to inoculate seven liters of M9 minimal media (Sambrook et al., 1989) containing 15NH4 Cl (1 g/l, Isotec Inc.) as the sole nitrogen source. The 15N-labeled protein was purified as described previously (Wall et al., 1994).

NMR spectroscopy NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer equipped with four channels, using 15N/13C doubly-labeled and 15N-labeled samples of DnaJ(2­108) at a concentration of about 1 mM in a solvent of 90% H2 O/10% 2H2 O. All spectra were recorded at pH 6.2 and at T = 28°C. Quadrature detection in the indirect dimensions was achieved using States-TPPI (Marion et al., 1989). For data processing and analysis we

measuring time was 30 hours. From these data exchange rates were obtained by a least square fit of the cross-peak intensities of the function I(t) = Io (1 - e-kt ), where Io and I(t) denote the cross-peak volumes at mixing time zero and mixing time t, respectively, and k is the first order exchange rate constant. For the determination of slower exchange rates, a sample of 500 ml of a fully protonated 1 mM H2 O solution of uniformly 15N labeled DnaJ(2-108) was lyophilized. The protein was then redissolved in the same amount of 2H2 O, and a series of twelve 2D [15N, 1H] COSY spectra were recorded, using a time domain data size of 200 × 512 complex points, and t1,max ( 15N) = 122.4 ms and t2,max ( 1H) = 131.1 ms. The individual measurements were started 4, 34, 64 ,94, 124, 184, 244, 364, 484, 604, 844 and 1084 minutes after preparation of the 2H2 O solution, which added up to a total recording time of 24 hours. The rate constants were obtained from a least-square fit of the cross-peak volumes to a single exponential function. 15 N spin relaxation time measurements were performed with uniformly 15N-labeled DnaJ(2­108) at a 1H resonance frequency of 600 MHz as described by Szyperski et al. (1993). All [15N, 1H] COSY spectra needed for these measurements were recorded with a time domain data size of 200 × 512 complex points, with t1,max ( 15N) = 122.4 ms and t2,max ( 1H) = 131.1 ms. For the measurement of longitudinal 15N spin relaxation times, T1 , a series of 11 spectra was recorded. The following relaxation delays were used: trel = 10, 40, 200, 400, 550, 700 and 900 ms, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 seconds. The total measurement time was 22 hours. Transverse 15N spin relaxation times, T2 , were obtained from a series of nine 600 MHz spectra with the following relaxation delays: trel = 25, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 140, 180 and 260 ms. The total measuring time was 18 hours. Rotating frame 15N spin relaxation times, T1r , were measured with a series of seven spectra and relaxation delays of trel = 30, 50, 70, 90, 130, 170 and 240 ms. Two different series of experiments were performed, with spin-lock powers of 12,868 rad s-1 and 6978 rad s-1, respectively. In order to avoid possible small off-resonance effects for glycyl residues, the series with 6978 rad s-1 was measured twice, setting the 15N carrier position to 109 and 126 ppm, respectively. The individual 15N­1HN cross-peaks were analyzed in the experiment with the smaller offset to the 15N carrier position. The total measuring time was 63 hours. All 15N spin relaxation times were obtained from a least-squares fit of the experimental data to a single exponential function. 15 N41H5 steady-state heteronuclear Overhauser effects were determined as described by Skelton et al. (1993), using the sensitivity enhancement scheme of Palmer et al. (1992) modified to the extent that proton saturation was achieved by application of high-power 120 degree pulse spaced at 20 ms intervals for three seconds prior to the first pulse on 15N (Kay et al., 1989). A relaxation delay of six seconds was used in order to reduce effects arising from amide proton exchange. The total measuring time was 88 hours for the two spectra recorded with and without proton-presaturation. NOE values were determined as the ratio of corresponding cross-peak volumes measured from the spectra acquired with and without 1H saturation during the recycle delay. Structure calculation The input for the distance geometry calculations with the program DIANA consisted of upper distance limits derived from the NOESY cross-peak intensities with the

The following spectra, were recorded to obtain sequence-specific resonance assignments: 3D Ha/bCa/b(CO)NHN (Szyperski et al., 1994b) with a time domain data size of 82 × 30 × 512 complex points; t1,max ( 13C) = 6.5 ms and, since the 1H chemical shifts were scaled up by a factor 1.65, t1,max ( 1H) = 10.8 ms, t2,max ( 15N) = 21.6 ms, t3,max ( 1H) = 65.5 ms. 3D CBCANHN (Grzesiek & Bax, 1992) with a time domain data size of 56 × 31 × 512 complex points, with t1,max ( 13C) = 6.5 ms, t2,max ( 15N) = 22.3 ms, t3,max ( 1H) = 65.5 ms; 2D [13C, 1H] COSY (Bodenhausen & Ruben, 1980), with a time domain data size of 150 × 1024 complex points, with t1,max ( 13C) = 14.1 ms, t2,max ( 1H) = 131.1 ms; 3D HCCHTOCSY (Bax et al., 1990) with a time domain data size of 100 × 30 × 512 complex points and a mixing time of 12 ms, with t1,max ( 1H) = ( 1H) = 17.4 ms, t2,max ( 13C) = 9.6 ms, t3,max ( 1H) = 74.7 ms; 3D HCCH-COSY (Kay et al., 1990) with a time domain data size of 100 × 20 × 512 complex points, with t1,max ( 1H) = 17.4 ms, t2,max ( 13C) = 6.4 ms, t3,max ( 1H) = 74.7 ms; 2D ct-[13C,1H] COSY (Vuister & Bax, 1992) recorded for aromatic side-chain assignments, with a time domain data size 512 × 1024 complex points, and t1,max ( 13C) = 26 ms, t2,max ( 1H) = 149.5 ms; 13C(v2 )-halffiltered 2D [1H,1H] TOCSY and 13C(v2 )-half-filtered 2D ¨ [1H, 1H] NOESY (Otting & Wuthrich, 1990) with mixing times of 50 ms and 100 ms, respectively, a time domain data size of 200 × 512 complex points, and t1,max ( 1H) = 34.8 ms, t2,max ( 1H) = 74.8 ms. Unless specified otherwise, the carrier positions were set to 4.72 ppm for 1 H, 117 ppm for 15N, 56 ppm, 43 ppm, 35 ppm and 128 ppm for 13Ca, 13Ca/b, 13Caliph. and 13Carom, respectively, and 177 ppm for carbonyl carbons. The 1H chemical shifts are relative to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (DSS). 15N and 13C chemical shifts are relative to internal DSS using the conversion factors proposed by Wishart et al. (1995). The conformational constraints for the structure determination were collected from 3D 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (Fesik et al., 1988) recorded with 100 ms mixing time, a time domain data size of 180 × 32 × 512 complex points, and t1,max ( 1H) = 31.3 ms, t2,max ( 15N) = 27.4 ms and t3,max ( 1H) = 74.8 ms and from 3D 13C-resolved [1H, 1H] NOESY (Ikura et al., 1990) performed with a mixing time of 70 ms, a time domain data size of 160 × 30 × 512 complex points, and t1,max ( 1H) = 27.8 ms, t2,max ( 13C) = 9.6 ms and t3,max ( 1H) = 74.8 ms. The vicinal 3 JHNa coupling constants were obtained by inverse Fourier transformation of in-phase multiplets (Szyperski et al., 1992) from a 2D [15N 1H] COSY spectrum recorded with a data size of 170 × 2048 complex points, and t1,max ( 15N) = 122.4 ms and t2,max ( 1H) = 131.1 ms. Vicinal 3 JNb scalar coupling constants were estimated from a 3D ct-HNNHB spectrum (Archer et al., 1991) performed with a time domain data size of 90 × 38 × 512 complex points, and t1,max ( 1H) = 31.3 ms, t2,max ( 15N) = 27.4 ms and t3,max ( 1H) = 74.8 ms 3Jab coupling constants were derived from a 15N-resolved [1H, 1H] TOCSY spectrum recorded with 50 ms mixing time, a data size of 180 × 38 × 512 complex points, and t1,max ( 1H) = 31.3 ms, t2,max ( 15N) = 27.4 ms and t3,max ( 1H) = 74.8 ms. For the measurement of rapid backbone amide proton exchange rates a series of seven 2D MEXICO experiments (Gemmecker et al., 1993) was recorded with 15N/13C doubly-labeled DnaJ(2­108). The mixing times were 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 and 400 ms, respectively, with time domain data size of 512 × 1024 complex points, and t1,max ( 15N) = 92.2 ms and t2,max ( 1H) = 131.1 ms.

HABAS also provided a ¨ number of stereospecific assignments of b-methylene protons. Several rounds of structure calculations with DIANA (Guntert et al., 1991) and NOESY cross-peak ¨ assignments with ASNO (Guntert et al., 1993) were ¨ performed. Backbone dihedral angle constraints derived from conformation-dependent 13Ca chemical shifts (Luginbuhl et al., 1995) were initially used to accelerate ¨ this iterative cycle, but were not used in the final structure calculation. Additional stereospecific assignments were obtained using the program GLOMSA (Guntert et al., 1991). No hydrogen bond constraints were ¨ included in the input for DIANA. The final round of DIANA structure calculations was started with 50 randomized conformers and included two REDAC cycles, where the maximal target function value per residue for locally acceptable segments was set to ° ° C(1) = 0.6 A and C(2) = 0.4 A, respectively (Guntert & ¨ Wuthrich, 1991). The resulting 20 DIANA conformers ¨ with the smallest residual target function values were subjected to restrained energy minimization using the AMBER force field (Weiner et al., 1986) as implemented in the program OPAL (P. Luginbuhl, P. Guntert, M. ¨ ¨ Billeter & K. Wuthrich, unpublished), where the ¨ pseudo-potential for NMR constraints was adjusted such ° that violations of 0.1 A for distance constraints and 2.5° for dihedral angle constraints corresponded to kB T/2 at room temperature. The energy minimization was carried out in a shell of water molecules with a minimal thickness ° of 6 A. A total of 1500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization were performed for each conformer. The resulting 20 energy-refined conformers are used to represent the solution structure of the J-domain. R.m.s.d. values were calculated with the program XAM (Xia, 1992), color Figures and stereo views were generated with the program MOLMOL (Koradi et al., 1996).
