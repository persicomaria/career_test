These studies have illustrated the critical role of virtually all of the and chain CDRs in pMHC recognition. However, this approach cannot elucidate either specific contacts that are made with the peptide versus the MHC or the TCR/ ligand binding energies that correlate with biological effects. These parameters can be determined only through structural studies of TCR/ligand complexes, combined with analysis of the binding properties of TCR mutants. Moreover, structural analysis alone is unable to map the energy of antigen recognition, since buried surface area correlates poorly with the energetic importance of individual residues (Cunningham and Wells, 1989; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). The combined approach of structural study and mutagenesis can provide insight at the molecular level into the processes of T cell selection, MHC restriction, and T cell function in general. Mariuzza and colleagues established that the structures of a chain (Bentley et al., 1995) and a V homodimer (Fields et al., 1995) resembled immunoglobulins (Ig). These structures also confirmed the existence of CDR loops, including HV4 in V and V . More recent crystallographic studies of intact TCRs have shed light on the topology of the interaction between the T cell antigen receptor and pMHC (Garboczi et al., 1996; Garcia et al., 1996a). Crystal structures of two MHC class I­restricted TCRs suggested that the receptor interacts with pMHC through a conserved, diagonal orientation. The fine specificity necessary to distinguish conformations of different peptides can be accounted for by direct contact of CDR residues with the pMHC ligand. All 2C and CDRs are positioned such that they contact either peptide or MHC or, in some cases, both (Garcia et al., 1996a), whereas in the A6 TCR, only four of the six CDRs have significant contact with the pMHC complex (Garboczi et al., 1996). To understand the binding energies associated with these contact residues, we have performed alanine scanning mutagenesis of the 2C TCR, whose three-dimensional structure in unliganded and liganded states has recently been determined (Garcia et al., 1996a, 1998). In the past, single-site alanine scanning mutagenesis has been useful for constructing energy maps of numerous protein interactions and for quantitating contributions of individual residues to binding. Notable examples include the interaction of human growth hormone and its receptor (Cunningham and Wells, 1989; Clarkson and Wells, 1995) and the interactions of antibodies with their antigens (Jin and Wells, 1994; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). The 2C TCR is derived from the murine T cell clone 2C (Kranz et al., 1984a), which recognizes an alloantigen--an octamer peptide p2C or the nonamer version QL9--in complex with Ld (Udaka et al., 1992; Sykulev et al., 1994). This TCR also recognizes two different peptide/Kb complexes: a self peptide, dEV8, bound to Kb (Tallquist et al., 1996) and a synthetic peptide, SIYRYYGL, bound to Kb (Udaka et al., 1996). The 2C TCR also recognizes dEV8 bound to the negatively selecting class I molecule Kbm3 (Tallquist et al., 1996). Accordingly, analyses of the binding energetics of a panel of 2C TCR

Summary The T cell receptor (TCR) from the alloreactive T lymphocyte 2C recognizes a nonamer peptide QL9 complexed with the MHC class I molecule H2-Ld. Fortytwo single-site alanine substitutions of the 2C TCR were analyzed for binding to QL9/Ld and anti-TCR antibodies. The results provided a detailed energy map of T cell antigen recognition and indicated that the pMHC and clonotypic antibody epitopes on the TCR were similar. Although residues in each V and V CDR are important in binding pMHC, the most significant energy for the TCR/QL9/Ld interaction was contributed by CDRs 1 and 2 of both and chains. The extent to which the individual energy contributions are directed at class I helices or peptide was also assessed. Introduction A T cell recognizes foreign antigen as a peptide bound to a class I or class II product of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The specificity of this recognition is determined by a heterodimeric cell surface protein called the T cell receptor (TCR). Like antibody genes, TCR genes are formed by rearrangement processes that generate a large repertoire of receptors with diversity in loops that constitute the three complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs) (Davis and Bjorkman, 1988). The and chains also each contain an additional hypervariable region, designated HV4. The molecular details of the interactions between TCR and peptide MHC (pMHC) ligands have been the focus of considerable effort over the past 10 years (Eisen et al., 1996). A number of studies have used mutagenesis to determine the involvement of the variable (V) regions, CDRs, or individual residues in recognition by T cells (Hong et al., 1992; Kasibhatla et al., 1993; Patten et al., 1993; Sant'Angelo et al., 1996). In each of these reports, mutagenized TCR genes were transfected into recipient T cells, and the T cell transfectants were analyzed for their ability to recognize a specific pMHC ligand as measured

Mutants are alanine mutants that could be expressed and refolded; expression defects are little or no protein yield, as judged by KJ16 and F23.1 ELISAs, after small-scale colony screens or refolding of large-scale preparations.

alanine mutants with each of these ligands could reveal details about the molecular basis of positive and negative selection. Together with the three-dimensional structures, this information could allow assessment of the relative contributions of TCR contacts with peptide and MHC residues. We present here data from a quantitative alanine mutagenesis scan of a TCR/ligand interaction. Residues are identified in each V and V CDR that are important for binding of the QL9/Ld complex. In the recently determined structure of the 2C TCR/dEV8/Kb complex, some of these residues were shown to contact the 1 or 2 helices of Kb, while others contacted the peptide dEV8 (Garcia et al., 1998). The total binding contributions of V residues were approximately equal to total binding contributions of V residues. CDR1 and CDR2 residues collectively contributed more binding energy than CDR3 residues. The binding energies associated with several TCR side chains that contact conserved class I residues were also significant, consistent with the suggestion that TCRs have evolved inherent MHC reactivity that exists within germline-encoded portions of the TCR (Zerrahn et al., 1997). Because recent evidence has shown that a 3-fold difference in affinity can distinguish positive or negative selection (Alam et al., 1996), these conserved interactions could be important in thymic selection and/ or the skewing of TCR repertoires toward class I versus class II reactivity (i.e., CD8 vs. CD4 selection) (Sim et al., 1996). In addition, they may be important in establishing the diagonal orientation of a TCR on the MHC product (Garboczi et al., 1996; Garcia et al., 1996a). The 2C TCR also interacts, at higher affinity, with the anticlonotypic monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1B2 (Kranz et al., 1984b; Schodin and Kranz, 1993). We show that all of the TCR residues that contact the QL9/Ld ligand also contact 1B2. However, two TCR residues in CDR2 are important for 1B2 binding, but they have a negative affect on QL9/Ld binding (i.e., the alanine mutants have higher affinity for QL9/Ld). These contacts account, at least in part, for the greater affinity of the TCR/1B2 interaction compared with the TCR/pMHC interaction. Finally, the epitope of the V 8.2-specific antibody F23.2 (Staerz et al., 1985) includes residues in the CDR1 and CDR2 of the V domain, consistent with predictions from previous studies. The ability of this antibody to distinguish between V 8.2 and other members of the V 8 subfamily (V 8.1 and V 8.3) could be accounted for by unique residues within these V 8.2 CDRs.

Results TCR Mutagenesis and Purification The V 8.2/V 3.1 TCR from cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone 2C was produced as a single chain in an Escherichia coli expression system to facilitate mutagenesis studies (Soo Hoo et al., 1992; Schlueter et al., 1996b). As shown previously, the solubility of this single-chain TCR (scTCR) was increased by expression as a C-terminal thioredoxin fusion protein (Schodin et al., 1996). The scTCR was shown to retain the peptide/Ld specificity of native TCR (Schlueter et al., 1996a, 1996b) and to react with four antibodies that are specific for the 2C TCR: F23.1 (V 8.1­8.3), KJ16 (V 8.1,8.2), F23.2 (V 8.2), and 1B2 (clonotypic) (Haskins et al., 1984; Kranz et al., 1984b; Staerz et al., 1985). The KJ16 and F23.1 antibodies recognize overlapping epitopes on V 8 that are located away from the pMHC binding site and that are distinct from the F23.2 and 1B2 epitopes. The F23.1 epitope includes residue 60 Asp (DiGiusto and Palmer, 1994), and the KJ16 epitope includes residue 18 Lys (Pullen et al., 1991; 16 Lys by the nomenclature in their report). F23.2 and 1B2 have overlapping epitopes, since these antibodies cross-compete with each other (our unpublished data). However, F23.2 and 1B2 clearly have different epitopes since F23.2 recognizes V 8.2 chains paired with any V (Behlke et al., 1987), whereas 1B2 is known to recognize only the V and V region combination derived from clone 2C (Soo Hoo et al., 1992). All four antibodies recognize conformational epitopes on the 2C TCR, since they require an intact intrachain disulfide bond within the TCR V domains for reactivity (Brodnicki et al., 1996). Based on these considerations, the antibodies could be used collectively as probes for the general structural integrity of scTCR mutants and to assess the concentration of properly folded mutants. In turn, the panel of scTCR mutants could be used to resolve the epitopes of F23.2 and 1B2. Fifty of the 62 residues located within the six CDR and two HV4 regions of the 2C TCR were subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis (Table 1). 52 Ala of the chain CDR2 was changed to a tryptophan. Of the 51 single-site mutants, 42 were successfully expressed and purified as scTCRs with acceptable levels of refolding (see below), yielding an overall success of 82% (summarized in Table 1), the same as that achieved for singlesite mutants in other systems (Wells, 1991). Refolding of scTCR proteins from inclusion bodies generally resulted in 10%­25% monomeric, properly

Figure 1. Antibody Reactivity of Representative scTCR Alanine Mutants Wild-type or mutant scTCR preparations at various concentrations were used to inhibit the binding of biotinylated wild-type scTCR to the V 8-specific mAbs KJ16 (A), F23.1 (B), or F23.2 (C) in a competition ELISA. Bound biotinylated scTCR was detected by streptavidin-HRP. Reactivity of scTCR mutants to the clonotypic mAb 1B2 (D) was assessed in a capture ELISA format involving immobilized 1B2 and employing KJ16 as the detecting agent. The degree of reactivity of each mutant toward a specific antibody was determined as the IC50mut/IC50wt using linear regression analysis. In 1B2 ELISAs, the concentration of TCR required for 50% maximal signal was used analogously to the IC50.

folded protein. The remaining protein existed as both disulfide-linked and noncovalently associated aggregates. When tested for binding to 1B2, essentially all the active protein existed within monomeric fractions (data not shown). Purification of scTCR mutants through a metal affinity chromatography column resulted in more than 95% pure protein, with an apparent molecular weight by sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of 42 kDa. Monomeric scTCR could be further isolated by HPLC G-200 size-exclusion chromatography. Analysis of the CDR mutants by electrospray mass spectrometry confirmed both the purity of preparations and the expected mass differences attributable to the single-site alanine mutations (data not shown). The wild-type scTCR was observed as a single peak with a mass of 40,536 3 Da (data not shown). TCR Folding and V 8 Antibody Reactivity To establish the extent to which the various mutant preparations exhibited proper refolding, we used the V 8-specific antibodies F23.1, KJ16, and F23.2 ( chain mutants only) in a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). V 8-specific antibodies were adsorbed to 96-well plates and then incubated with biotinylated wild-type scTCR in the presence of mutant scTCRs. Based on inhibition curves, the fraction of properly folded scTCR among different mutants was generally similar (Figure 1). Some mutants appeared to be

grossly misfolded by these criteria (Table 1) and could not be evaluated further. Not surprisingly, most of these mutations were for residues suggested to be important in overall stability of a CDR loop or individual V or V domain, either through hydrogen bonding of side-chain atoms (25 Gln, 29 His, 49 Ser, 54 Ser, and 69 Arg) or through hydrophobic packing interactions within the V domain (73 Phe, 32 Met, 69 Arg, and 75 Phe) (Garcia et al., 1996a). A determination of each mutant's anti-V 8 antibody reactivity was calculated as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for the mutant relative to that for the wild type (IC50mut/IC50wt) (averaged for KJ16, F23.1, and F23.2). This value was used to normalize results of 1B2 and QL9/Ld binding, in order to account for variations in protein purity and fraction of properly folded material. After normalization, similar binding results were obtained for a mutant whether it was tested as a monomeric protein (i.e., metal affinity and HPLC G-200 purified) or as a mixture of monomeric and aggregate protein (i.e., metal affinity purified only) (data not shown). TCR Binding to Anti-V 8.2 Antibody F23.2 A previous study showed that a G53D mutation eliminated binding of a V 8.2 region by antibody F23.2, suggesting that the epitope of F23.2 includes CDR2 (Pullen et al., 1990; 51 Gly mutation by the nomenclature in their report). To resolve the epitope recognized by F23.2,

Figure 2. Summary of scTCR Binding to F23.2, 1B2, and QL9/Ld Reactivities were calculated based on the relative IC50 of each mutant as compared to the wild type using linear regression analysis. Mutants that have decreased binding affinities compared to wild-type TCR are indicated by bars extending above the zero line, while mutants that have increased binding affinities are indicated by bars extending below the line. QL9/Ld assays were performed in triplicate and ELISAs in duplicate. Error bars represent the standard deviation obtained from two or more separate experiments. Mutants for which QL9/L d binding was not detectable were considered as having at least 15-fold reduced binding (i.e., 49 Tyr, 50 Tyr, 31 Asn, 48 Tyr, and 50 Tyr).

each TCR mutant was examined in a quantitative F23.2 ELISA (Figure 1C). None of the V mutations affected binding by F23.2, relative to reactivity with KJ16 and F23.1 (Figure 2). However, mutations in four residues (28 Asn, 48 Tyr, 50 Tyr, and 56 Glu) of the V region had a significant effect on F23.2 binding. In addition, the nonconservative substitution of a tryptophan at 52 Ala also reduced the binding of F23.2 by approximately 5-fold, relative to that of KJ16 and F23.1 (data not shown). Thus, the epitope for F23.2 encompasses both the CDR1 and CDR2 loops of the chain (Figures 2 and 3). The smaller, but still significant, effect of a mutation at 72 Gln of the HV4 may be explained either by a direct contribution to the F23.2 epitope or, alternatively, by the role this residue plays in stabilizing CDR1 (i.e., the side chain of 72 Gln hydrogen bonds to the main chain of residue 28 Asn). The identification of key V 8.2 residues involved in F23.2 binding provides a molecular explanation for the ability of F23.2 to distinguish V 8.2 from V 8.1 and V 8.3 regions. Comparison of the CDR1, CDR2, and HV4 sequences among these proteins shows that V 8.2 has

four differences from V 8.1 and nine differences from V 8.3 in these regions. Residues 28 Asn and 56 Glu contribute the most energy to the F23.2/V 8.2 interaction, and both of these residues are different in V 8.3. Although V 8.1 and V 8.2 are identical at these positions, V 8.1 has a nonconservative substitution (GD) at residue 53. Since changes at residues 52 Ala (this report) or 53 Gly (Pullen et al., 1990) affect F23.2 binding, it is clear that the V 8.1 substitution at residue 53 accounts in part for the ability of F23.2 to distinguish between the V 8.1 and V 8.2 regions.

TCR Binding to Clonotypic Antibody 1B2 The availability of the clonotypic antibody 1B2 provides an excellent opportunity to examine a ligand whose epitope overlaps with QL9/Ld, yet that binds to the TCR with considerably higher affinity (KD 10 9 M) (Schodin and Kranz, 1993). A capture ELISA was used because biotinylation of wild-type scTCR affected its binding to 1B2. The concentrations of scTCR required to yield 50% maximal binding were calculated and used to compare

the reactivities of mutants with the wild type (Figures 1D and 2). Mutation of CDR2 tyrosines at positions 49 , 50 , 48 , and 50 all affected binding of 1B2. However, the greatest effects were observed with mutations at 100 Phe and 31 Asn, both of which are highly solvent exposed in the unliganded TCR structure. In fact, 100 Phe is the most prominent residue on the surface of the unliganded TCR. Similar to results for F23.2, there was little energetic contribution of HV4 residues in either the V or the V , with the possible exception of 72 Gln in the HV4 loop. As described above, this effect could either be due to a direct contact with 1B2 or, perhaps more likely, to destabilization of CDR1 . These data, together with structural analysis, indicate that the 1B2 epitope covers ° ° an area approximately 34 A by 22 A, centered over CDR3 of the TCR. None of the four substitutions (102 Ser, 55 Thr, 56 Glu, and 76 Ser) that resulted in increased binding of QL9/Ld (see below) showed the same effect with 1B2. TCR Binding to QL9/Ld Alanine substitutions were assessed for their effect on binding of the TCR to QL9-L d using a quantitative competition assay involving the T2-Ld cell line. Selected mutants were also examined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore) analysis. The specificity and sensitivity

of scTCR binding in the T2-Ld cell assay, using various QL9 peptide analogues, have been shown previously (Schlueter et al., 1996a). Mutants were first characterized in a series of assays for their ability to inhibit Fab binding at maximal scTCR concentrations (data not shown). Mutants for which inhibition was undetectable at maximal scTCR concentration were considered as having at least 15-fold reduced binding. To quantitate the relative affinities, titration binding studies were performed with mutants that were capable of inhibiting Fab binding (Figure 4). Two to six experiments were performed for each mutant. From the titration of each mutant, a QL9/Ld reactivity value was determined as the IC50mut/IC50wt . This value was normalized for V 8 reactivity, and the average from separate experiments was calculated (Figure 2). To confirm results of competition assays, several of the chain mutants were further analyzed using surface plasmon resonance with purified QL9/Ld complexes. Direct immobilization of scTCR yielded either no binding or variable results among the mutants, possibly attributable to the reduced size and stability of the scTCR as compared to the full-length TCR. Therefore, a competition format was examined, using immobilized 2C TCR produced from Drosophila melanogaster cells (Garcia et al., 1996b) and soluble QL9/Ld in the presence of soluble scTCR. The various mutant scTCRs tested as

Figure 4. Inhibition of 125I Anti-Ld Fab Binding by Wild-Type and Representative Alanine Mutant scTCRs T2-L d cells that had been loaded with the peptide QL9 were incubated for 1 hr at 4 C with 125I Fab fragments and various concentrations of inhibitor scTCR. Titrations were performed in triplicate, and bound counts per minute were determined after spinning cells through oil to separate free 125I Fab fragments. QL9-Ld reactivity for each mutant was determined as the IC50mut/IC50wt. These values were normalized for the extent of proper refolding, using V 8 reactivity for each mutant. Representative results of several different experiments are illustrated.

inhibitors showed a similar order of reactivity as observed in the Fab competition assay (D53 S102 S69 wild type F100 T29 P30 Y26 K68). In our experience, the T2-Ld cell binding assay was able to resolve smaller differences in binding affinities, perhaps because these assays can be performed at 4 C and in the presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA), which might reduce nonspecific interactions. CDR1 of the chain contributes a comparatively large binding energy to the 2C/QL9/Ld interaction, with 29 Thr and 31 Tyr being especially critical and 24 Tyr, 26 Tyr,

and 30 Pro contributing intermediate energy. In CDR1 of the chain, binding by the N31A mutant could not be detected, while 27 Asn contributed intermediate binding energy. The remaining CDR1 mutants that could be folded properly exhibited activity similar to that of the wild type. The tyrosine residues at position 49 and 50 within CDR2 of the chain have been implicated in loop stabilization (Garcia et al., 1996a) but are also accessible to antigen. Mutation of either tyrosine to alanine eliminated binding. The remaining CDR2 residues (51 Ser, 53 Asp, 54 Pro, and V l55 ) that are more distal to the peptidebinding site contributed negligible energy to binding. These results indicate that the hydroxyl moiety of 51 Ser does not make a significant energetic contribution to binding QL9/Ld. This discovery was surprising, because this serine makes important contacts with Kb (Garcia et al., 1998) and also has been implicated in skewing the T cell repertoire toward the CD4 phenotype (Sim et al., 1996). However, a proline at this position (found in the V 3.2 region) was actually found to be more favored than a serine in the preferential skewing toward a CD8 phenotype (Sim et al., 1996). Within CDR2 , 48 Tyr and 50 Tyr were similar to 49 Tyr and 50 Tyr in that alanine substitution of either tyrosine residue abolished binding. Residues 55 Thr and 56 Glu in CDR2 were of interest since alanine mutations at these positions resulted in a 2-fold increase in affinity. In the 2C/dEV8/Kb structure, ° 56 Glu lies 9 A opposite 71Glu of the 1 helix, a negatively charged residue common to both Kb and Ld that may represent an unfavorable electrostatic interaction surface. Four CDR3 residues within the chain were changed to alanine. In the crystal structure of unliganded 2C, residue 100 Phe plays a prominent role in guarding the "pocket" within the 2C binding site (Garcia et al., 1996a) but occupies a completely different conformation in the 2C/dEV8/Kb complex (Garcia et al., 1998). The F100A mutant exhibited a 4-fold reduction in binding. 93 Ser is accessible to antigen, yet an alanine substitution at this position does not affect binding. In contrast, the largely buried L104A mutant shows a significant binding effect, perhaps attributable to disruptions in loop stabilization. The alanine substitution at 102 Ser improved the affinity for QL9-L d by 2-fold. In the crystal structure, 102 Ser lies directly over the center of the peptide but makes no ligand contacts. Modeling of the 2C/QL9/Ld complex places 102 Ser in a position of steric clash with P6Pro (Speir et al., 1998), thus providing a possible basis for the increased affinity of this alanine mutant. CDR3 of the chain is unusually glycine rich, and only one of these glycine residues (97 Gly) was changed to an alanine. The G97A , L106A , and Y107A mutants of CDR3 each exhibited a moderate (1.5- to 3-fold) reduction in binding to QL9-Ld. Therefore, although these CDR3 residues make some contributions to binding, it does not appear that any is absolutely critical for recognition. Mutation of 105 Thr, which makes no ligand contacts in the Kb complex, had no effect on binding QL9/Ld. Alanine substitutions of HV4 residues within both the and chains had minor or no effects on QL9/Ld binding. Several mutations exhibited a reproducible 1.5- to 2-fold

reduction in affinity. As described above for F23.2 and 1B2, the Q72A mutant bound QL9-Ld with 2-fold reduced affinity compared to wild type. In addition, a small, but highly reproducible and significant, effect was observed for the K68A mutant. 72 Ser also showed a small but significant effect that might be expected by its role in stabilizing the HV4 loop through a hydrogen bond to 67 Ser. Structural Comparison with the 2C/dEV8/Kb Complex The effect of alanine substitutions on QL9/Ld binding was compared with the observed structural contacts

from the refined 2C/dEV8/Kb complex (Table 2). The positioning over the pMHC of residues evaluated for ligand binding is illustrated using the modeled 2C/QL9/Ld complex in Figure 5 (Speir et al., 1998). Although almost all of the residues that contact dEV8/Kb were observed to exert detectable influences on QL9/Ld binding, several residues that significantly reduce binding to QL9/Ld do not obviously contact dEV8/Kb. These include 24 Tyr, 29 Thr, 30 Pro, 49 Tyr, 104 Leu, 27 Asn, 48 Tyr, 106 Leu, and 107 Tyr (Figure 2). Structural analysis suggests that many of these residues may be exerting their effects through stabilization or positioning of residues (or entire loops) that actually do contact ligand.

pMHC ligands with measurable affinity and also reacts with many of the V 8-specific bacterial superantigens. Furthermore, the availability of mice transgenic for the 2C TCR allows the correlation of biochemically measured ligand­receptor affinities with their immunological consequences, whether it is thymic selection, activation of naive CTL precursors, or the triggering of primed CTLs. For the approach of alanine scanning mutagenesis, the 2C TCR offers the distinct advantage of having the highest binding affinity yet described for a TCR/pMHC 10 7 M for QL9/Ld [Sykulev et al., interaction (K D 1994]). By taking advantage of this affinity, it was possible to quantitate the reductions in affinity associated with many of the single-site alanine mutations. These same alanine mutations can also be used in the future to examine the contributions of individual residues to binding dEV8/Kb, SIYRYYGL/Kb, and V 8-reactive superantigens. The 2C TCR system is also useful because several mAbs recognize its V regions, including the clonotypic antibody 1B2, which serves as a high-affinity probe for the structure of recombinant TCR.

Figure 5. Analysis of the Binding Energetics of TCR Residues in the 2C/QL9/Ld Modeled Complex Residues evaluated for binding to QL9/L d are colored according to the magnitude of their effect on ligand binding: red, greater than 8-fold reduced; pink, 2- to 8-fold reduced; yellow, 0.7- to 2-fold reduced; and green, less than 0.7-fold reduced (i.e., higher affinity). (A) Side view with the Ld 2 helix in the foreground. (B) Top view with the complex rotated approximately 90 toward the viewer, about an axis passing through peptide QL9. Energy calculations provide an estimate that approximately 37% of the energy is attributable to interactions with the peptide and approximately 63% to interactions with the antigenic MHC helices.

However, several of these residues (especially 29 Thr, 106 Leu, and 107 Tyr) do not obviously appear to be involved in stabilization and thus may make unique contacts with the QL9/Ld ligand. Using the 2C/dEV8/Kb structure as a guide for assigning whether a TCR residue contacts peptide, MHC, or both, it is possible to approximate that 37% of the energy (2.6 kcal/mol) is directed at binding peptide and 63% is directed toward the MHC (4.4 kcal/mol). Discussion The 2C T cell system provides a useful model for the study of various aspects of T cell structure and function. The 2C TCR binds to both allogeneic and syngeneic

Peptide/MHC Binding by the 2C TCR Residues from all six CDR loops are clearly involved in the 2C TCR/QL9/Ld interaction. The greatest degree of binding energy is contributed by the CDR1 and CDR2 loops of both chains, a moderate amount by the CDR3 loops, and a very small but quantifiable amount by the HV4 loops. Within the chain, CDR1 is clearly the source of the most significant binding energy. While CDR2 appears to be less important, mutation of the CDR loopstabilizing tyrosines at positions 49 and 50 dramatically decreases binding. A similar observation holds for the chain, where the critical positions are CDR1 residue 31 Asn and the loop-stabilizing tyrosines at positions 48 and 50 . In both the and chains, the most distal of the CDR2 residues (53 Asp, 54 Pro, 55 Thr, and 56 Glu) show either equivalent or slightly improved binding when mutated to alanine. In the refined 2C/ dEV8/Kb structure (Garcia et al., 1998), these distal CDR2 residues are located in the area where the loop bends away from the MHC helices toward solvent, and thus these residues may not be positioned to contact QL9/Ld. The unliganded 2C TCR structure showed that 100 Phe of the CDR3 protrudes prominently from the surface, close to a hydrophobic pocket between CDR3 and CDR3 that is positioned at the center of the TCR. Our expectations based on these aspects of the unliganded 2C TCR structure were that 100 Phe would be an important residue in contacting the pMHC ligand. It was therefore a surprise that many non-CDR3 residues have more significant effects than 100 Phe, although this residue does contribute significantly ( G 0.76 kcal/mol). This stands in contrast to the major effect of this position in contacting 1B2 (discussed below). This apparent discrepancy is understood in light of the 2C/dEV8/Kb com° plex structure, in which 100 Phe has moved 6 A to a position contacting the MHC 1 helix at 65Gln/62Arg. Thus, interactions of this phenylalanine with QL9/Ld may have entropic penalties associated with its movement at the surface.

Mapping the Energy of TCR Antigen Recognition 421

A previous report using V 3.1 and V 3.2 TCR transgenic mice showed that CDR1 and CDR2 residues from the chain can skew the T cell repertoire toward either CD4 or CD8 cells, presumably by biasing an interaction with either class I or class II molecules (Sim et al., 1996). This finding is entirely consistent with the large binding energy we observe attributable to CDR1 and CDR2 , which are structurally positioned to interact largely with the MHC helices rather than the peptide. In fact, two key residues at CDR1 position 27 and CDR2 position 51 have been implicated in these selection effects. Although we were unable to evaluate 27 Ser, residue 51 Ser did not contribute significant energy to the QL9/Ld interaction. This finding must be interpreted in view of the CD4/CD8selection biases described originally (Sim et al., 1996). V 3.1 (present in the 2C TCR) was shown to skew cells toward the CD4 phenotype, while V 3.2 (containing a proline at position 51) skewed cells toward a CD8 phenotype. What then accounts for the fact that V 3.1 2C T cells are invariably skewed toward a CD8 phenotype (Sha et al., 1988; Manning et al., 1997)? Within the 2C TCR (which is entirely class I restricted), other interactions (besides 51 Ser) with the MHC helices are clearly sufficient to direct this particular T cell along the CD8 selection pathway. For example, four residues within CDR1 and CDR2 of the chain (26 Tyr, 29 Thr, 31 Tyr, and 50 Tyr) together account for greater than 5 kcal/mol of binding energy, largely (but not exclusively) through interactions with residues that are conserved across class I molecules. Furthermore, the CDR1 and CDR2 of the V 8.2 region from the 2C TCR contributes significant energy to the interaction with pMHC. Some of these contacts are clearly with MHC residues and thus most likely contribute during the positive selection of these T cells during development. This possibility is supported by our previous findings (Tjoa and Kranz, 1994) and others' findings (Connolly, 1994) that V 8 regions are preferentially expressed in T cells reactive with the p2C/Ld complex. Of those mutants that could not be analyzed because of problems in expression or folding of the recombinant TCR, three of the residues (48 Lys, 29 His, and 54 Ser) are positioned at the surface of the TCR and could possibly be involved in binding QL9/Ld. Two of these residues (48 Lys and 29 His) are in contact with the dEV8/Kb ligand.

(Garcia et al., 1998), but it does hydrogen bond with the main-chain oxygen of Ans28 in the unliganded 2C structure (Garcia et al., 1996a). Thus, our mutagenesis results suggest that the HV4 loop is involved indirectly rather than directly in pMHC recognition. In a recent study, the 2C/QL9/Ld interaction was modeled on the 2C/dEV8/Kb refined structure, and HV4 residue 69 Arg was suggested to contribute significantly to ligand binding by an electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged P8Asp of peptide QL9 (Speir et al., 1998). Mutagenesis of 69 Arg in the current study was unable to address this question, since neither alanine nor glutamic acid substitutions yielded properly refolded protein. The inability to refold these mutants is not entirely unexpected, since 69 Arg is largely buried between CDR loops and contributes important hydrogen bonds that stabilize CDR1 and CDR2 . Similarly, within HV4 , a small but highly reproducible binding effect is seen with the K68A ( G 0.20 kcal/ mol) and S72A ( G 0.24 kcal/mol) mutants. Residue 68 Lys of the A6 Tax-specific TCR hydrogen bonds to 166Glu in the class I molecule HLA-A2 (Garboczi et al., 1996). 68 Lys is conserved among most V genes and residue 166Glu is conserved among all class I, but not class II, molecules. Within the 2C TCR, 68 Lys may be contributing its energy through an electrostatic rather than direct interaction, since it is too distant from Kb residues to form distinct hydrogen bonds. Alternatively, in the 2C/QL9/Ld complex, these two residues may be close enough to interact directly. In any event, the small effect seen with the K68A mutation seems to argue for a weaker electrostatic interaction, at best.

Involvement of HV4 Loops Because the HV4 loop represents a major site of sequence variation compared to Ig V regions, there had been some early expectation that it might be important in pMHC recognition (Patten et al., 1984). However, it is clear from our results that the mutated residues within either the HV4 or HV4 loops contribute in only a minor way to the thermodynamic stability of the TCR/QL9/Ld complex. Among the HV4 V residues, 72 Gln appears to have the most significant effect on recognition of QL9/Ld (as well as F23.2 and 1B2). The negative effect of alanine substitution is probably due to destabilization of the CDR1 and HV4 loops rather than direct contact with the ligand. This conclusion is based on the observation that 72 Gln does not contact the dEV8/K b ligand

Contribution of TCR Residues That Contact MHC Helices, Peptide, or Both The 2C TCR may be unusual compared to foreign peptide/self MHC-specific TCR in that it has been selected for alloreactivity. It has been suggested that the absence of allo-MHC molecules in the thymus allows developing alloreactive T cells to escape negative selection, a process that might result in generally higher affinities for alloreactive TCRs (Sykulev et al., 1994). In this regard, the 2C TCR might be expected to have a larger energy contribution from residues that contact the helices of the allo-MHC molecule, compared to residues that contact primarily the peptide. Perhaps in line with this argument, the 2C TCR contains CDR3 loops that are relatively short and that also lack charged residues for direct ionic interactions. Using the refined structure of the 2C/dEV8/Kb complex (Garcia et al., 1998), assignments were made as to whether each residue tested for binding contacted primarily MHC helices, peptide, both, or neither. Based on this approach, we estimated that the energy attributable to residues contacting the Ld helices is approximately 4.4 kcal/mol, whereas the energy attributable to QL9 peptide contact is approximately 2.6 kcal/mol (Table 2). Thus it appears that slightly more than one third of the total energy is directed at the peptide and almost two thirds toward the MHC. This estimate is based on the premise that QL9/Ld and dEV8/Kb will have the same distribution of TCR contacts to peptide versus MHC. However, the fact that

Immunity 422

peptide QL9 is a nonamer while dEV8 is an octamer and the existence of the "hydrophobic ridge" in the Ld molecule (Balendiran et al., 1997) would likely result in greater solvent-exposed peptide area for QL9/Ld as compared to dEV8/K b. In the refined 2C/dEV8/Kb structure, the proportional surface area of the pMHC contacted by the TCR was 23% peptide and 77% MHC helices. Assuming that 2C interacts with both pMHC complexes in a similar orientation, it is not unexpected that the energy directed at peptide QL9 was greater than this 23% surface area suggests. That is, the 3D structure of 2C/QL9/Ld may reveal that some of the interactions assigned to MHC based on the 2C/dEV8/Kb complex may actually be with the QL9 peptide. One such key interaction has been proposed based on molecular modeling of the complex (Speir et al., 1998). The observation that a significant fraction of the binding energy is associated with contacts to conserved residues of the MHC helices has important biological implications. Considerable energetic contact occurs between CDR1 and CDR2 of the V and V and the tops of the MHC helices (Table 2 and Figure 5). We predict that these contacts are responsible for the inherent MHC reactivity that exists within germline-encoded portions of the TCR (Zerrahn et al., 1997). Moreover, these interactions are also likely to account for the affinity that class I­restricted TCRs appear to have for nonrestricted MHC class I molecules and that has been predicted to be a requirement for T cell survival in the periphery (Tanchot et al., 1997).

residues that contact the 1B2 antibody. The structure of another scTCR (KB5-C20) interacting with its clonotypic antibody Fab fragment (Desire -1) has recently been re´ ´ ported (Housset et al., 1997). In that crystal structure, the interaction was centered over the c strand of the TCR V domain, a positioning similar to that reported here for the 2C/1B2 interaction, which is centered roughly over the CDR3 loop. An important difference is that only a limited number of TCR CDRs were involved ´ ´ in the KB5-C20/Desire-1 complex, whereas the 2C/1B2 interaction involves all six CDRs. Thus, consistent with the exquisite specificity with which it recognizes 2C, 1B2 contacts each of the areas of the TCR that might be predicted to be the most antigenic (i.e., the CDR loops). Despite the overall similarity in contact residues for the QL9/Ld and 1B2 epitopes, important differences were observed in relative energy contributions among residues. Aside from the four critical tyrosines within the CDR2 loops, the most important residues for 1B2 binding were 31 Asn 100 Phe 28 Asn 56 Glu, whereas the most important residues for QL9/Ld binding were 29 Thr 31 Tyr 31 Asn 100 Phe. In addition, two V residues, 55 Thr and 56 Glu, showed opposing effects with the 1B2 and QL9/Ld ligands. Binding of 1B2 was reduced considerably by substitution of either of these residues with an alanine, whereas binding of QL9/Ld was increased slightly by the same substitution.

Similarities in TCR Contacts with Anticlonotypic Antibody 1B2 and pMHC The binding energies associated with individual CDRs, and even specific residues, for the 2C ligands QL9/Ld and 1B2 were remarkably similar. It is thus clear why the 1B2 antibody requires the specific V and V domains expressed only by clone 2C and why the reactivity of 1B2 has been shown to reflect directly the reactivity of soluble TCR with the QL9/Ld ligand (Schlueter et al., 1996b). The energy map of TCR binding to both the pMHC ligand and the anticlonotypic antibody is similar in some ways to the interaction of the antilysozyme antibody D1.3 with its antiidiotypic antibody E5.2 (Braden et al., 1996; Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). For example, both the 2C/1B2 and 2C/QL9/Ld complexes appear to be stabilized by the accumulation of many productive interactions covering the entire binding interface, as with the D1.3/E5.2 complex (Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). This contrasts with the energy of the D1.3/lysozyme interaction, where only a few of residues within the binding site account for most of the binding energy (Dall'Acqua et al., 1996). The similarity of the 1B2 and QL9/Ld epitopes is surprising given the major differences observed between TCRs and antibodies. That is, TCRs are believed to contact their pMHC ligands with a conserved orientation whereas antibodies recognize numerous diverse topologies. In addition, TCRs have considerably lower affinities than most antibodies. These properties might have led to the prediction that there would be significant differences between the residues that contact pMHC and the

F23.2 Epitope Previous studies have shown that CDR1 and CDR2 of the V 8.2 region are important in binding by mAb F23.2. The fact that these CDRs are also involved in binding by 1B2 accounts for the ability of 1B2 and F23.2 to block reciprocally the binding of each other. It is also clear that neither CDR3 residues nor any V residues are involved in direct interactions with F23.2. This finding is consistent with early studies that demonstrated F23.2 bound to T cells that expressed a V 8.2 region, regardless of the V 8.2 CDR3 or the associated chain. Within CDR1 and CDR2, residue 31 Asn was among the most critical for binding to 1B2 and QL9/Ld, yet it does not contribute to binding by F23.2. In contrast, residues 56 Glu of CDR2, and to a lesser degree 28 Asn of CDR1, are among the most critical for binding F23.2 (and 1B2), but these residues do not contribute to binding QL9/Ld. These findings demonstrate that each of these ligand interactions exhibits differences in the mechanisms by which binding to the TCR is achieved. Of the chain residues examined, 28 Asn (CDR1), 48 Tyr, 50 Tyr, and 56 Glu (CDR2) had the most significant effects on the binding by F23.2. Comparison of the V 8.2 sequence with V 8.1 and V 8.3 shows that only V 8.3 differs at any of these positions (N28S and E56Q). The combined effect of mutations at these two residues is greater than three orders of magnitude in binding affinity, and thus these residues can account for the lack of reactivity of F23.2 with V 8.3. The major differences between V 8.2 and V 8.1 reside at residues 30 (ND), 31 (NY), 51 (GV), and 53 (GD). Mutant N30Ab exhibited some problems in folding ( 5-fold reduced KJ16 and F23.1 reactivity), but it as well as N31A

Mapping the Energy of TCR Antigen Recognition 423

was shown to have unimpaired reactivity with F23.2 (Figure 2 and data not shown). Nevertheless, V 8.1 substitutions at these two positions are less conservative than alanine mutations and could effect binding. Substitution of a tryptophan at 52 Ala reduced binding of F23.2 by 5-fold (data not shown). This finding, together with previous evidence of the importance of 53 Gly (Pullen et al., 1990), suggests that the ability of F23.2 to distinguish between V 8.2 and V 8.1 resides in part in this segment of CDR2. Conclusions The 2C TCR binds to its alloantigenic ligand, QL9/Ld, through residues located in each of the CDR in the and chains. The order of energies involved in binding is approximately CDR1 CDR1 CDR2 CDR2 CDR3 CDR3 . These relative binding contributions correlate reasonably well with the surface contact areas calculated for each of these regions from the crystal structure of the 2C/dEV8/Kb complex (Garcia et al., 1998). The results suggest that the 2C TCR interacts with these two peptide/class I complexes, which represent positive and negative selecting ligands for 2C, with similar orientations and with similar contributions to binding. In contrast to some expectations, the majority of the binding energy resided in non-CDR3 residues. This might be in part accounted for by the fact that 2C CDR3s are shorter and contain fewer bulky residues than many other TCRs. TCRs with longer CDR3s are likely to have additional interactions that contribute to antigen binding, as observed with the longer CDR3s in the A6/Tax/ HLA-A2 complex (Garboczi et al., 1996). In this respect, the 2C TCR might be a model of binding energetics achieved more through TCR interactions with MHC, than through interactions with peptide. Thus, the 2C TCR has provided a framework for understanding processes that focus on these interactions, such as positive selection, T cell survival, memory responses, and alloreactivity.
Experimental Procedures scTCR Mutagenesis Various alanine-substituted scTCRs were constructed using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)­based technique (Landt et al., 1990). In brief, a short mutagenic primer and a V - or V -specific primer were used in the first PCR step to generate a "megaprimer " which was then isolated and used in a second PCR with the opposing V or V -specific primer. All PCR reactions were carried out using cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Following the second PCR, the KpnI­Bam HI­digested product was ligated into pUC-19M, transformed into DH5 or NM522 strains for sequencing, subcloned into the pTRXFus vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and transformed into GI698 for expression. scTCR Expression and Purification Proteins were expressed in E. coli as described previously (Schodin et al., 1996) and purified from inclusion bodies by denaturing metal affinity chromatography and G-200 size exclusion chromatography. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE as well as by electrospray mass spectrometry for several of the mutants (performed at the University of Illinois Mass Spectrometry Facility). mAbs KJ16 (Haskins et al., 1984) is a rat IgG mAb that is specific for the mouse V 8.1 and V 8.2 regions. F23.1 (Staerz et al., 1985) is a mouse IgG2 mAb that is specific for the mouse V 8.1, V 8.2, and

V 8.3 regions. F23.2 (Staerz et al., 1985) is a mouse IgG1 mAb that is specific for the mouse V 8.2 region. 1B2 is an anticlonotypic mouse mAb that is specific for the TCR found on the T cell clone 2C (Kranz et al., 1984b). 30-5-7 (Ozato et al., 1980) is a mouse IgG2 mAb that is specific for the 2 domain of H2-Ld. Antibodies were purified from either culture supernatants or ascites. Fab fragments of 30-5-7 were produced by digestion with papain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 5 min at 37 C followed by size-exclusion chromatography through a Superdex G-200 column. Residual intact mAb or Fc regions were removed by passage over a protein A agarose column (Gibco­BRL, Gaithersburg, MD). ELISAs V 8-specific competition ELISAs were performed by adsorption of KJ16, F23.1 or F23.2 to the wells of Immulon 2 ELISA plates (Dynatech Labs, Chantilly, VA). The wells were blocked with phosphatebuffered saline, 0.25% BSA, and 0.05% Tween, and after washing, 100 l of mutant or wild-type TCR and 50 l of biotinylated wildtype TCR at a 1:1000­1:3000 dilution were added to the wells. After 30 min, the wells were washed and binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)­streptavidin and tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry, Gaithersburg, MD). Inhibition curves were plotted and the IC50 for each mutant and wild type were calculated using linear regression analysis. For 1B2 capture ELISAs, 1B2 was adsorbed to the wells, and after washing, 50 l of mutant or wild-type TCR was added to the wells. Bound TCR was detected with KJ16 and goat anti-rat HRP conjugate (Kirkegaard and Perry). Peptide/MHC Binding Assays A competition cell-binding assay was used to monitor binding of TCR to QL9/Ld complexes, as previously described (Schlueter et al., 1996a, 1996b). To form peptide/Ld complexes on the surfaces of T2-L d target cells, cells were incubated with approximately 10 M of the specific peptide for 3­5 hr. For the competitive binding assay, peptide­up-regulated cells (3 10 5/well) were incubated with 0.7 nM 125I 30-5-7 Fab and various concentrations of scTCR for 1 hr on ice in the presence of 0.7% BSA. After incubation, bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation through dibutyl phthalate/ olive oil. All assays were done in triplicate. For the BIAcore assay, Drosophila-expressed 2C TCR was immobilized using classic carbodiimide amine coupling chemistry (BIAcore) to a CM5 sensorchip (200­500 response units) at pH 5.2 in 10 mM acetate (Garcia et al., 1996b). Measurements were carried out at 25 C in phosphate-buffered saline (no detergent added) with a flow of 20 l/min on a BIAcore 2000. Sensorgrams from control surfaces (OVA-2 TCR) were subtracted from sensorgrams generated on the 2C surface. Soluble H2-Ld was purified as previously described (Garcia et al., 1996b) and complexed to QL9 or murine cytomegalovirus peptides (5-fold molar excess of peptide) at room temperature. Competition experiments were conducted by coinjection of a fixed amount of Ld with increasing concentration of scTCR. Statistical Analysis of Binding Data The percentage inhibition of T2-Ld binding was corrected for the binding of 125I 30-5-7 Fab fragments to Ld molecules that do not contain the peptide of interest, as follows: % inhibition (cpmQL9, no TCR cpmno peptide ) 100. Inhibition curves cpm QL9, with TCR)/(cpmQL9, no TCR were constructed, and within each experiment a sample of wildtype scTCR was included as an internal control. QL9/Ld reactivity was calculated as the IC50 mut/IC50wt and was normalized for V 8 reactivity to account for variations in the percentages of properly folded proteins. Results from titration experiments were consistent with the degree of inhibition observed in single-point inhibition studies (our unpublished data). Structural Analysis Structural analysis was performed on an Indigo 2 work station (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA) using the Quanta Software package (Molecular Simulations, Burlington, MA). The refined structure of the 2C/dEV8/Kb complex (Garcia et al., 1998) was used to assign pMHC contacts for those 2C residues tested by mutagenesis.
