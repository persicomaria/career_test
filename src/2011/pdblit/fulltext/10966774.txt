A Comparison of Certain Properties of Desmodium Yellow Mottle Turnip Yellow Mosaic Viruses Walters and Scott (1) isolated Desmodium yellow mottle virus (DYMV) from Desmochurn spp. growing in central Arkansas. The virus infected legumes only but reacted with turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) antiserum. Electron micrographs of purified preparations showed "empty" and "full" particles. The work described here compares certain additional properties of DYMV with those of TYMV. The DYMV isolate was passed through three local lesion transfers on a "large-leaf" Desmodium sp. (1). Virus was purified from infected bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. "Great Northern") harvested and frozen 7-10 days after inoculation. Infected tissue was homogenized in 0.2 M NaH2P04 (1 g per 2 ml) and the homogenate squeezed through cheesecloth. The extract was adjusted to pH 5.0 with 0.1 N HCl, stirred for 30 min at room temperature, and subjected to three alternate low speed (SOOOg 10 min) and for high speed (80,OOOg 90 min) centrifugafor tions. Virus pellets were resuspended in 0.01 1M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The TYMV, obtained from J. M. Kaper, Beltsville, Maryland, was purified from infected chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensisL. "Chihili") by the same procedure. The schlieren pattern obtained with puripreparations in the Spinco fied DYMV Model E analytical ultracentrifuge was typical of members of the Tymovirus group (2). Two components with sedimentation coefficients of about 54 S and 114 S, estimated by Markham's graphical method (S), were observed (Fig. 1). Antisera were developed in rabbits by repeated intramuscular injections of purified viruses mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Comparisons of the two viruses at 1 mg/ml using homologous and heterologous antisera in gel diffusion tests in 1% agarose in water with 0.02 % sodium aside resulted in reciprocal spur formation (Fig. 2A). Reactions of DYMV and TYMV with heterolo-

and

gous antisera were obtained within a few weeks after the injection series were begun. Purified virus at 4 mg/ml was electrophoresed for 1 hr at 400 V, ca. 10 mA, in the Gelman-LKB immunoelectrophoresis apparatus using Gelman Verona.1buffer. Immunodiffusion and staining were performed as described by the Gelman Manual (Gelman Instrument Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Both viruses moved as single components but DYMV moved more rapidly toward the anode (Fig. 2B). The spectra of the nucleic acids extracted with phenol (4) exhibited maxima and minima at 260 and 230 nm with a ratio of max/min = 2.0-2.2. The DYMV nucleic acid was about 0.5-1.0 % as infectious as an equal amount of nucleic acid in intact virus and lost infectivity upon incubation with ribonuclease. Base analyses of DYMV nucleic acid by the method of Kaper et al. (5) gave the following ratio: G = 16.5 %, A =

Harrison et al. (2) originally listed eight viruses in the Tymovirus group. Scrophularia mottle virus has recently been added (7). The DYMV is serologically related to TYMV and has certain of the familiar properties of this group, e.g., two centrifugal components and a high cytosine content. Therefore, it should be included as a new member of the Tymovirus group.
