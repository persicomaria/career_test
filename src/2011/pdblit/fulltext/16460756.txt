SUMMARY A method is described for the rapid determination of flavins in sea water, based on solid-phase extraction followed by ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. Riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and their photochemical breakdown products, lumiflavin, formylmethylflavin, and lumichrome can be determined with subpicomolar detection limits. The method was used at sea in the analysis of coastal and open ocean waters. In both environments, riboflavin, lumiflavin and lumichrome were routinely observed at concentrations in the picomolar range; lumiflavin and lumichrome were generally confined to the photic zone while riboflavin was present throughout the water column. Formylmethylflavin, FMN, and FAD were only occasionally observed; when present, these flavins were observed at consistently higher concentrations than riboflavin, lumiflavin and lumichrome.

Flavins are biologically and chemically important trace components of sea water. Riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) play critical roles in biochemical cycles of most organisms [ 1]. Additionally, flavins are highly reactive photochemically and may influence the composition of sea water through photosensitized reactions involving riboflavin, FAD, and FMN and their photochemical degradation products lumiflavin, formylmethylflavin and lumichrome [2]. Owing to the biochemical importance of riboflavin, FMN, and FAD, numerous studies of these flavins in foods and beverages have been reported [ 3-51. However, in the marine environment, the lack of a practical analytical method with sufficient sensitivity for quantitative studies has inhibited the study of flavins. Momzikoff [6] first reported riboflavin in sea water. This determination involved extraction of large volumes of sea water (on the order of 20 000 l), which would be impractical for routine application. More recently, Dunlap and Susie [ 71 reported a method for flavin analysis in sea water using HPLC. The method is sensitive and reliable, but sample prepara0003-2670/87/$03.50 o 1987 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

tion is lengthy and complicated. As a result, this method is unsuitable for shipboard applications or routine work. In this paper, a rapid, simple but sensitive method is reported for the determination of'flavins in sea water, based on solid-phase extraction followed by ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. The method has been used successfully at sea on several occasions to investigate flavin distributions and photodynamic processes in the water column.
EXPERIMENTAL

Apparatus and chromatographic conditions The liquid chromatograph used in this method consisted of an Eldex Model Chromat-A-Trol gradient controller and an Eldex Model 100A single piston pump (Eldex Laboratories, Menlo Park, CA), a Valco Model CV-6UHPa-N60 injection valve (Valco Instrument Co., Houston, TX), and a Hewlett-Packard 100 X 4.6 Hypersil C-18 reversed-phase column with 5-E.trn packing. The fluorimeter was a Gilson Model 121 filter fluorimeter (Gilson Instruments, Middleton, WI) with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 305-395 nm and 435-650 nm, respectively. Results were reported on a Hewlett-Packard Model 3390A reporting integrator. The mobile phase consisted of 4.5 mM tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA) in 30/70 (v/v) methanol/l0 mM sodium acetate buffer, with pH adjusted to 5.80 with acetic acid. The mobile phase flow rate was 1.8 ml min-1 with isocratic elution. The injection loop was 200 ~1. Reagents and standards Riboflavin, lumiflavin, lumichrome, FMN, and FAD were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company. Formylmethylflavin was prepared by periodic acid cleavage of riboflavin using the method of FalI and Petering [ 81. Concentrated standards (approximately 1 X lo4 M) were prepared in 50/50 (v/v) acetonitrile/methanol or 50/50 (v/v) water/methanol, depending on solubility. The stock solutions were diluted to 1.0 PM in lo/90 (v/v) methanol/water and stored in the dark at 4°C. Chromatographic-grade methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI), chromatographic-grade sodium acetate from Baker Chemical Co., and tetrabutylammonium acetate from Fluka Chemical Co. Sample prepamtion After collection, sea water samples were stored immediately in amber or opaque bottles. Samples were concentrated by pumping 500 ml in succession through an in-line Whatman GF/C filter and a Sep-Pak C1s cartridge (Waters Chromatography Division) which had been preconditioned with 2 ml of methanol followed by 3 ml of 4.5 mM TBAA. The pump flow rate was 18 ml min-' (Ismatec IPS peristaltic pump).

129

The concentrated sample retained on the Sep-Pak was washed with 3 ml of water to remove residual sea salts. Flavins were eluted with 1.0 ml of methanol followed by 3.0 ml of water. This procedure resulted in a concentration factor of 125. If a greater concentration factor was required, a larger initial sea water sample was used. The sample extract was stored in the dark at 4°C until injection. If the extract was to be stored for more than 48 h before injection, the 100% methanol eluate was stored with dilution to 25% methanol prior to injection. At all stages of sample preparation, storage, and processing, care was taken to prevent exposure to light, because of the photosensitivity of some flavins.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Extraction efficiency, precision and detection limits Extraction efficiency was tested by using sea water samples spiked with flavin standards to levels allowing direct injection (0.1-1.0 nM). The average percent recovery calculated for all flavins was 104 + 3% (Table 1). Additionally, recoveries at various pump flow rates were examined to determine the maximum feasible extraction flow rate. A noticeable drop in percent recovery was observed at flow rates above 18 ml min-' (Table 2). In order to evaluate the extraction precision, a large volume of spiked sea water was split into eight aliquots which were simultaneously extracted and processed. For all flavins except FAD, the relative standard deviation was less than 10% (Table 1). The lower precision in the determination of FAD can be attributed to difficulties in quantifying the broader FAD peak (see Fig. lb). The detection limits shown in Table 1 were evaluated for a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. It should be noted that these detection limits were the limits for direct injection of unconcentrated sea water. The detection limit for a concentrated sea-water sample depended on the volume of sea water extracted and the concentration of interfering fluorescent compounds (such as humic substances) in the sample.

Optimization of the ion-pairing agent The addition of an ion-pairing agent to the mobile phase had two important effects: a flattening of a large interference peak (presumably humic substances) that eluted at the beginning of the run, and an increase in the retention times of the ionic species FMN and FAD. Without this increase in retention time, FMN and FAD eluted near the system dead volume and were not quantifiable. Additionally, without flattening of the early eluting interference peak, flavins eluting near the beginning of the run could not be accurately quantified (see Fig. la). Several quaternary ammonium salts were tested as ion-pairing agents. Addition of tetrabutylammonium acetate (TBAA) at concentrations of 2.0

131

mM to 5.0 mM provided the desired increase in retention times and flattening of the interference peak (Fig. lb). It should be noted that the optimum concentration of TBAA, i.e., the concentration that gave the best separation with an acceptable run time, varied with the make of reversed-phase column used. It is important, therefore, to optimize the concentration of TBAA for each system. Comparison of filtered and unfiltered samples Tests were done to establish the effect of filtration on the extraction procedure. Samples of sea water enriched with a variety of marine bacteria and phytoplankton were split into two aliquots, one of the aliquots was filtered, and both were analyzed (Table 3). While lumiflavin and lumichrome appeared to be unaffected by filtration, a slight decrease in the concentration of riboflavin was consistently observed in filtered samples. The magnitude of this effect increased slightly with decreasing filter pore size, suggesting that the decrease in flavin concentration was due to removal of particles from the water sample (Table 4). However, even for the smallest filter pore-size, this effect was small; thus, it may be inferred that flavins in sea water are predominantly in the dissolved form. Pteridines Pteridines are a class of compounds closely related to the flavins. To establish if the pteridines interfere with the flavin chromatography (e.g.,

through co-elution) or if any of a number of unknown compounds found in natural samples were pteridines, standards of several common pteridines were run under the same chromatographic conditions used for flavins. The standards run included pterin, pterin8carboxylic acid, xanthopterin, isoxanthopterin, and lumazine. In all cases, the pteridines eluted near the system dead volume. Analysis of natuml samples Samples were collected at coastal and open ocean sites. A chromatogram of a natural water sample is shown in Fig. lc. Riboflavin, lumiflavin, and lumichrome were found at all sampling areas although lumiflavin and lumichrome were generally confined to the photic zone. Riboflavin and lumiflavin were generally found at concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 pM while lumichrome was generally found at 20-200 pM. These values are similar to the values reported by Momzikoff [ 61 and Dunlap and Susie [ 71. Formylmethylflavin, flavin mononucleotide, and flavin adenine dinucleotide were observed at few locations. When observed, however, their concentrations were usually somewhat higher than those of other flavins (on the order of 100-1000 PM). Our field studies have demonstrated that flavins generally follow several major trends which can be explained in terms of their biological and photochemical activities. As would be expected, flavins were found at higher concentrations in more biologically active areas such as coastal areas or biologically active depths in the water column in the open ocean. Additionally, flavins display a distinct diurnal variation, with concentrations highest during dark hours (as would be predicted by their photochemical behavior [2] ). However, these were general trends only, and several deviations were observed. Details of field studies will be presented in separate publications.
