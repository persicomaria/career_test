Abstract N-Acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) gene of Deinococcus radiodurans BCRC12827 was cloned into expression vector pQE30 to generate pQE-naaar and expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli JM109. The expressed enzyme purified from the crude cell extract of IPTG-induced E. coli JM109 (pQE-naaar) exhibited high racemization activity to N-carbamoyl-L-homophenylalanine (NCa-L-HPA) and N-carbamoyl-D-homophenylalanine (NCa-D-HPA) with specific activities of 1.91 U/mg protein and 1.31 U/mg protein, respectively. To develop a recombinant E. coli whole cell system for the conversion of racemic NCa-HPA to L-homophenylalanine (L-HPA), naaar gene from D. radiodurans and L-Ncarbamoylase (LNCA) gene from Bacillus kaustophilus BCRC11223 were cloned and coexpressed in E. coli cells. Recombinant cells treated with 0.5% toluene at 30 8C for 30 min exhibited enhanced NAAAR and LNCA activities, which are about 20- and 60-fold, respectively, higher than those of untreated cells. Using toluene-permeabilized recombinant E. coli cells, a maximal productivity of 7.5 mmol L-HPA/l h with more than 99% yield could be obtained from 150 mmol racemic NCa-HPA. Permeabilized cells also showed considerable stability in the bioconversion process using 10 mmol racemic NCa-HPA as substrate, no significantly decrease in conversion yield for L-HPA was found in the eight cycles. # 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction
L-Homophenylalanine [L-HPA, (s)-2-amino-4-phenylbutanoic acid] is a precursor required for the preparation of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin inhibitors [1,2]. Many ACE inhibitors such as benazepril, enalapril, and lisinopril are commercially used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure [3]. A number of chemical methods have been reported for the synthesis of L-HPA [4,5]. However, chemical methods generally suffer from process complexity, high cost, and environmental pollution. Thus, enzymatic methods that are enantioselective and can be performed in environmentally friendly condition are extensively studied.

Protease can enantioselective convert L-HPA ester to LHPA, followed by kinetic resolution to separate L-HPA from D-HPA ester [6]. However, only about 50% of the racemic substrates can be converted to L-HPA. Aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) and tyrosine aminotransferase from Escherichia coli have been used to produce L-HPA using either aspartate or glutamate as amino donor and 2-oxo-4phenylbutanoic acid (OPBA) as amino acceptor [7]. Recently, an E. coli AAT variant with high activity toward lysine and OPBA is developed [8]. Using engineered E. coli AAT as biocatalyst and inexpensive lysine as amino donor, the OPBA can be converted to L-HPA with 97% yield and more than 99.9% ee. However, substrate (OPBA) inhibition is demonstrated in E. coli AAT activity. We had developed a novel whole-cell system, with the expression of Deinococcus radiodurans N-acylamino acid racemase (NAAAR) and L-aminoacylase genes in E. coli, which allows total conversion of racemic N-acetyl-homophenylalanine

(NAc-HPA) to L-HPA with high purity [9]. Such a process however is restricted in the real application due to the low solubility of NAc-HPA (about 20 mM in 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and 50 8C). We also found that racemic homophenylalanylhydantoin can be converted to L-HPA with 99.9% ee by non-stereospecific hydantoinase from Bacillus caldolyticus and L-N-carbamolyase (LNCA) from Bacillus kaustophilus [10]. Since the B. caldolyticus hydantoinase displays high activity toward D-homophenylalanylhydantoin, a large amount of N-carbamoyl-D-homophenylalanine (NCa-D-HPA) is accumulated in the course of the reaction and only 49% yield of L-HPA can be obtained in the process. Given NCa-HPA has high solubility (about 190 mM in the 50 mM Tris­HCl at pH 8.0 and 30 8C) and can be easily synthesized from aldehyde and urea by amidocarbonylation reaction [11]. In this study, we report a N-carbamoylase method for the production of L-HPA from racemic NCa-HPA (rac-NCa-HPA). E. coli cell coexpressing NAAAR and LNCA was constructed for the conversion of NCa-HPA to LHPA. The permeabilization conditions for recombinant E. coli cells to increase their cell enzyme activities were also investigated.
2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials
Chemicals for protein assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). NCa-D-HPA and NCa-L-HPA were the generous gifts of Professor Teng-Kuei Yang (Department of Chemistry, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan). L-HPA was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). CTAB, Tween 20, toluene, and Triton X-100 are products of Sigma­Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo). Other reagents were purchased from Merck (Rahway, NJ).

2.3. Expression and enzyme activity assay
The constructions of pQE-naaar and pQE-lnca were described as previously reports [14,15]. To construct a plasmid coexpressing NAAAR and LNCA, a DNA fragment containing lnca gene was amplified from pQE-lnca using primers pQEU (50 -ACTAGCTAGCTCGTCTTCACCTCGAGAAATC30 ) and pQED (50 -CCAAGCTAGCTTGGATTCTCACC-30 ), which introduce sequence for Nhe I site at 30 and 50 ends of lnca gene, respectively. The recovered products were cloned as a Nhe I­Nhe I fragment into the corresponding sites of pQE-naaar to generate pQE-arlnca (Fig. 1). Both naaar and lnca genes in plasmid pQE-arlnca contained T5 promoter/lac operator element and N-terminal His6-tagged LNCA, respectively. Recombinant plasmids were then introduced into E. coli JM109. For high-level expression of the recombinant enzymes, E. coli JM109 (pQEarlnca) was grown in LB broth containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml) and incubated overnight at 37 8C with shaking. Culture was diluted (1:100) with 100 ml of LB and incubated at 37 8C for 4 h. To induce the gene expression, isopropylb-D-thiogalactosidase (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the cultivation was continued at 30 8C for an additional 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and 4 8C for 10 min. Bacterial pellets were washed twice with 25 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The washed cells were resuspended in 10 ml Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication. The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and 4 8C for 20 min. The supernatant was then loaded into a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with lysis buffer (10 mM imidazole, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 mM Tris­ HCl buffer at pH 8.0). After four washing steps using 10 ml of washing buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, the adherent His-tag proteins were eluted from the column with a buffer containing 100 mM imidazole. The protein concentration was assayed according to the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as the standard [16]. The NAAAR activity was assayed mainly according to the method described by Tokuyama and Hatano [17]. In brief, an appropriate amount of enzyme was incubated with 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM cobalt chloride, and 10 mM substrates at 50 8C for 30 min, followed by boiling for 5 min to stop the reaction. The final mixture was separated and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Chirobiotic T column (Astec Inc., Whippany, NJ). The activity of LNCA was measured as follows: the reaction mixture (500 ml) containing 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 10 mM NCa-L-HPA, 1 mM cobalt chloride, and an appropriate amount of the enzyme was incubated at 50 8C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by heating at 100 8C for 5 min. The amount of substrate and product was determined by HPLC using Chirobiotic T column. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min and the chromatograms were developed over an isocratic elution with 40% methanol, 60% of 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.5 ml acetic acid per liter. The absorbance of the effluent was recorded at 210 nm.

2.2. Strains, plasmid and DNA manipulation
E. coli JM109 was used for cloning, gene expression and whole cell biotransformation. E. coli strain was transformed by the method described by Hanahan [12] and grown in Luria­Bertani (LB) medium. The E. coli cells harboring plasmids were cultivated in the LB medium supplemented with 100 mg ampicillin/ml. DNA manipulation was performed as described by Sambrook and Russel [13].

2.4. Cell permeabilization
The recombinant E. coli cells were suspended in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to OD600 of 30, and the permeabilizing agent was added to a final concentration of 0.5 or 1%. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min and then incubated at 30 8C for 30 min with rotary shaking (150 rpm). The treated cells

were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and then resuspended in the same buffer to OD600 = 30.

2.5. Biotransformation
The production of L-HPA from rac-NCa-HPA by permeabilized cells was carried out in a glass vessel (250 ml) equipped with a propeller-type impeller. Reaction mixture (100 ml) containing 2 mM CoCl2, 0.1 M Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 5 g (wet weight) of cells, and given amount of rac-NCa-HPA, and pH 8.0 was maintained by a pH controller (Suntex pH/ORP Controller PC310, Taiwan). At the end of the reaction, the pH of the reaction solution was adjusted to 2 by 1N HCl. The precipitated L-HPA were collected by vacuum filtration, washed with cold water, and analyzed by HPLC method using Chirobiotic T column.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. Racemization activities of NAAAR to Ncarbamoylamino acids In the previous report, we have found that the NAAAR from D. radiodurans has high racemization activity toward chiral Nacetyl-homophenylalanine [9]. The NAAAR from Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60 has also found to have the capability to racemize N-carbamoyl-D-methionine [17]. To evaluate the feasibility of using this enzyme in carbamoylase process for LHPA production, racemization activities of D. radiodurans NAAAR against N-carbamoylamino acids were determined. As shown in Table 1, high activity was observed when NCa-D-HPA or NCa-L-HPA were used as the substrate. D. radiodurans NAAAR showed no detectable activity toward NCa-L-arginine, NCa-L-tryptophan, and NCa-L-histidine. The specific activities of NAAAR to NCa-D-HPA and NCa-L-HPA were 1.31 and 1.91 U/mg protein, respectively. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first NAAAR with the racemization activity toward NCa-HPA to be reported. Succinyl-CoA:D-amino acid N-succinyl-transferase, N-succinylamino acid racemase, and N-succinyl-L-amino acid hydrolase from Geobacillus kaustophilus can irreversibly convert the D-amino acids to their corresponding L-amino acids [18]. The NAAARs from Amycolatopsis sp. TS-1-60, Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. lurida DSM43134, and

Amycolatopsis azurea CCRC13413 have the ability to catalyze racemization of N-acylamino acids [17,19,20]. We found that D. radiodurans NAAAR exhibited higher racemization activity to N-acetyl-HPA [9] than to N-carbamoyl-HPA. We have determined the crystal structure of D. radiodurans NAAAR and found that residues Phe 26 and Phe 30 in lid region form a van der Waals interaction to N-acetyl group of N-acetyl-Lglutamine [15]. The D. radiodurans NAAAR with lower activity toward the N-carbamoylamino acids might be due to that the N-carbamoyl group of NCa-HPA can not form van der Waals interactions with Phe 26 and Phe 30 in the lid region of NAAAR. Hydrolytic activity of N-carbamoylase have been reported to be inhibited by its product, ammonium ions [21,22], which may lead to low productivity and yield in the biotransformation process. As shown in Fig. 2, the enzymatic activities of both LNCA and NAAAR were not inhibited by ammonium. Instead, hydrolytic activity of LNCA was increased with the increasing amount of ammonium ions. In the presence of 250 mM of ammonium ions, about 1.6-fold increased activity was observed. 3.2. Coexpression of naaar and lnca genes in E. coli cells In whole cell biotransformation process using two enzymes as catalysts, coexpression of two enzyme genes in one-cell only needs one kind of recombinant cells for enzyme production. Moreover, the transport barrier of intermediate posed by cell membranes can be omitted. To take these advantages, recombinant E. coli cell with coexpressed NAAAR and LNCA was constructed and used as biocatalyst for the dynamic resolution of rac-NCa-HPA to L-HPA. Both naaar and lnca genes were cloned into pQE30 under the control of T5 promoter. The recombinant plasmid pQE-arlnca was introduced into E. coli JM109. Expression of genes was induced by 0.5 mM IPTG at 30 8C for 6 h, and the protein profiles of transformants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Distinct protein bands corresponding to the molecular masses of NAAAR and LNCA were found and more than 90% of recombinant proteins in the E. coli cell extract were soluble forms (Fig. 3(A)). The

ratio of the expressed soluble NAAAR and LNCA in the transformed cells was about 1:1 and the cell enzyme activities of NAAAR and LNCA were 37 and 42 mU/g cell, respectively. To obtain high yield of L-HPA in the two enzymes reaction system, the optimal reaction conditions for the enzymes should be considered. Both B. kaustophilus LNCA and D. radiodurans NAAAR have higher activity over the pH range 7.5­8.5. The optimal temperatures for the NAAAR and LNCA was 60­ 70 8C, but a temperature of 37 8C was suitable for the whole cell in a long time reaction. Therefore, pH 8.0 and 37 8C were used in the biotransformation process for L-HPA production. 3.3. Permeabilization of recombinant E. coli cells In the preliminary experiments, we found that the intact cell of recombinant E. coli (pQE-arlnca) exhibited considerable low efficiency in the conversion of racemic NCa-HPA to LHPA, in which it took 32 h to complete the reaction and only a productivity of 0.31 mmol L-HPA/l h was obtained (Fig. 4). Low productivity of L-HPA may be resulted from the low activities of cell enzymes: 37 mU/g cell for NAAAR and 42 mU/g cell for LNCA (Table 2). Inevitably, we ascribed low cell enzymes activities to the cell wall and cell membrane permeability barriers to the uptake of substrate (NCa-HPA) and release of product (L-HPA) by the recombinant cells. It have been reported that the N-carbamoyl-D-hydroxyphenylglycine has a low permeability through the cell membrane of E. coli, resulting in a low hydantoinase activity of recombinant E. coli cells [23,24]. Six permeabilizing agents were used to treat the recombinant E. coli cells and to determine their effects on the cell permeability with respect to cell enzyme activities and conversion yield of L-HPA from rac-NCa-HPA (Table 2). Among the detergents and solvents employed, toluene-treated cells showed the highest cell enzymes activities and conversion yield of L-HPA, followed sequentially by Triton X-100-, Tween 20-, CTAB-, DMSO-, and methanol-treated cells. The NAAAR and LNCA activities of E. coli JM109 (pQE-arlnca) cells treated with 0.5 and 1.0% of toluene were about 20- and 60-

fold, respectively, higher than those of untreated cells, which resulted in about 10-fold increase in the conversion yield of LHPA as compared with the reaction using untreated cells. Toluene has been used to permeabilize Gluconobacter suboxydans cells for the oxidative conversion of D-sorbitol to Lsorbose [25]. The cells treated with 10% toluene resulted in a three-fold increased in the sorbitol dehydrogenase activity and a two-fold increase in the efficiency of D-sorbitol conversion to L-sorbose, compared to those of the untreated cells. Recombinant E. coli K38 T7-5KE32 treated with 2% toluene, about 60% increase in the conversion yield of L-carnitine from trimethylammonium compounds was observed, comparing with that of untreated cell [26]. Apparently, the concentration of toluene used was a key parameter in determining the feasibility of permeabilization for enhancing the cell enzymes activities. As shown in Fig. 3(B), the amount of released protein was increased with increasing the concentration of toluene, and the major released proteins exhibited the molecular mass of about 43 kDa, comparing well with the calculated subunit masses of

a Enzyme activity assays for NAAAR and LNCA coexpressed in the E. coli cells were performed by HPLC method using 10 mM NCa-D-HPA and 20 mM NCa-L-HPA as substrates, respectively. NAAAR activity was assayed by monitoring the consumption of NCa-D-HPA. LNCA activity was determined by monitoring the formation of L-HPA from NCa-L-HPA. b Conversion yield was determined by measuring L-HPA formation in the reaction mixture (50 ml) containing 10 mM rac-NCa-HPA, 50 mM Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and 2 mM CoCl2 at 37 8C for 4 h.

the LNCA (45 kDa) and NAAAR (40 kDa). The results implicated that large `canals' are made in the cytoplasm membrane by high concentration of toluene. Interestedly, a significant enzymatic activity of LNCA was detected in the supernatant from the centrifugation of the toluene-permeabilized cells, whereas no NAAAR activity could be observed in the supernatant fraction. Additionally, the LNCA activity in the supernatant fraction was increased with increasing toluene concentrations. The apparent molecular mass of the subunit for the recombinant LNCA enzyme was approximately 45 kDa [14], and our gel filtration results (data not shown) indicated that the native LNCA seem to be a homodimeric structure with molecular mass of about 90 kDa. The NAAAR from D. radiodurans consists of a homooctamer (about 320 kDa) in aqueous solution [15]. Our results demonstrated that toluenepermeabilized cells do not allow the high-molecular-mass molecule, NAAAR, to leave the intracellular milieu. It has been reported that the degree of protein leakage decreases with increased molecular weight of the enzyme, while enzymes with large molecular weights probably leak less [27]. The optimal conditions for toluene treatment were also determined with respect to cell enzyme activities. Reaction mixture of 20 ml containing 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 mg cell/ml was incubated at 30 8C with rotary shaking (150 rpm). Premeabilization of IPTG-induced E. coli JM109 (pQE-arlnca) was performed by using different concentrations of toluene, and the cell enzymes activities of treated cells were analyzed by HPLC method. As shown in Fig. 5(A), increase in

Cells (50 mg wet wt. cell/ml) were suspended in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) for toluene treatment at 30 8C.

toluene concentration resulted in increase in NAAAR and LNCA activities in cell mass up to 1.0%, above which cell enzymes activities significantly decreased. The effect of the treatment time on the cell enzymes activities was also investigated. When the cells were incubated with 0.5% toluene at 30 8C, maximal cell enzymes activities were observed within 30 min, while cell enzymes activities were decreased in further incubation (Fig. 5(B)). Low cell enzymes activities caused by treating the cells with high concentration of toluene and long incubation time might be due to loss a large amount of cell enzymes from the permeabilized cells (Fig. 3(B)) and inactivation of NAAAR and LNCA by toluene treatment. Taken together, 0.5% toluene and incubation time of 30 min seem to be an optimal conditions for permeabilizing the E. coli JM109 (pQE-arlnca) cells used in the L-HPA production. 3.4.

engineering or regulating the expression levels of naaar and lnca genes using different promoters with different strength [28]. To determine the reusability of the permeabilized cells, after the conversion, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with cold Tris­HCl buffer (pH 8.0), and then immediately used for the next runs. As shown in Fig. 7, the toluene-permeabilized cells can be reused at least eight times with more than 90% conversion yield, and more than 75% of the conversion yield remained at the 12th cycle. We found that the cell enzymes activities of NAAAR and LNCA were considerably stable. About 85­90% of cell enzymes activities were observed at the 12th cycle, demonstrating the potential reusability of the toluene-permeabilized cells in the L-HPA production. 4. Conclusion In this study, we found that the NAAAR from D. radiodurans has high racemization activity toward NCaHPA. With the coexpression of D. radiodurans naaar and B. kaustophilus lnca in the E. coli JM109 and permeabilization of recombinant E. coli cells with 0.5% toluene at 30 8C for 30 min, a novel carbamoylase method was developed for the production of L-HPA from rac-NCa-HPA. This process allows total conversion of 150 mM rac-NCa-HPA to L-HPA in 20 h with a productivity of 7.5 mmol L-HPA/l h. This is the first carbamoylase method for the enzymatic production of L-HPA from NCa-HPA to be reported. However, further work on process optimization is needed to evaluate the feasibility of using this process in the commercially production of L-HPA from rac-NCa-HPA.

and IPTG-induced toluene-permeabilized recombinant E. coli JM109 (pQE-arlnca) cells with NAAAR and LNCA activities of 35 and 120 U/l, respectively, was incubated at 37 8C for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 6(A), the conversion could be completed in 5 h, yielding a productivity of 2 mmol L-HPA/l h, which is about six-fold higher than that from untreated cells. When the concentration of substrate was adjusted to 150 mM (approach to the maximal solubility of rac-NCa-HPA) and the activities of NAAAR and LNCA were three-fold increased (105 and 360 U/ l, respectively) in the reaction mixture, a maximal productivity of 7.5 mmol L-HPA/l h with conversion yield of more than 99% was achieved in the 20 h reaction (Fig. 6(B)). During the reaction, L-HPA was continuously precipitated in the reaction solution, which efficiently shifted the reaction equilibrium toward the product formation. It is noted that the NCa-D-HPA (substrate) for NAAAR was accumulated during the course of the biotransformation. The results implied that low activity of NAAAR present in the biomass might be the rate-limiting step in L-HPA production. This problem could be overcome by improving the racemization activity of NAAAR by protein
