The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc containing endoproteinases catalyzing degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). As such, they represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of a diverse range of pathological conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).1 A growing body of evidence has specifically linked MMP-12 (macrophage metalloelastase) with COPD2 making the development of small molecule MMP-12 ligands of high interest.3 Historically, MMP inhibitors have been typically non-selective as they have relied on potent metal binding motifs, for example, hydroxamates and reverse hydroxamates, for the majority of their potency. As MMP activity, and indeed activity at other related metallo-enzymes, is required for numerous essential processes within the body, broad spectrum metallo-enzyme inhibition is considered undesirable. As a consequence we sought to identify potent and selective inhibitors of MMP-12. A high throughput screen of the GSK compound collection identified a number of MMP-12 active compounds. These were refined by removal of molecules with undesirable physiochemical properties (high Mw, clog P etc.) and compounds carrying high affinity metal binding motifs (hydroxamates, reverse hydroxamates and thiols). It was anticipated that the use of a weaker zinc binding

group, for example, a carboxylic acid, would result in compounds with better selectivity profiles than those in which the binding interaction was dominated by high affinity metal chelation. An initial measure of selectivity was carried out by determining potency at the closely homologous enzyme MMP-13 (Collagenase3). This information allowed the identification of a number of classes of MMP-12 selective compounds. Finally, a detailed kinetic profile of exemplars of each of these classes was obtained and analysis of the data using a Lineweaver­Burk plot of 1/v against 1/[S] allowed classification of the modes of action (competitive, noncompetitive, mixed etc.). Following these analyses a number of structures were identified as possible synthetic starting points--detailed here is the initial optimization of 1 (Fig. 1).

This encouraging initial data led us to obtain a full selectivity profile for racemic 1 and both of its enantiomers against the GSK panel of metallo-enzymes and other proteinases and to initiate crystallographic studies in order to understand the mode of binding of 1 to MMP-12. Cross screening of 1 and its constitutive enantiomers revealed an encouraging broader selectivity profile. All were inactive against a diverse range of serine, aspartyl and cysteine proteinases. Furthermore, high selectivity was observed against a range of metalloproteinases (Table 1).4 Initially it was speculated that 1 was binding with MMP-12 in a mode where both the alcohol and carboxylic acid of the b-hydroxy acid functionality were coordinated to the catalytic zinc, however, this proved not to be the case. Crystallographic investigations revealed that only the carboxylic acid coordinated to zinc and that the hydroxyl group is forming a hydrogen bonded interaction to the Leu181 residue (Fig. 2).4 Though Leu181 and its flanking residues are highly conserved in human MMPs5 it was reasoned that this hydrogen bonding interaction was the key to the selectivity of 1. This interaction positions the biaryl fragment deep in the S10 pocket of the MMP-12 where substantial differences in homology between the MMPs exist and previous studies have suggested selectivity can be obtained.6 On the basis of these observations two regions of the molecule were identified for preliminary investigation via analogue syntheses, occupancy of the S10 pocket and the H-bonding interaction to Leu181 (Fig. 3).

Two types of variation in P10 were initially investigated, substitution of the terminal aryl ring and complete replacement of the biaryl fragment. Variation in the terminal aryl ring was achieved by the use of Suzuki chemistry on iodide 5, which was prepared from commercially available benzyl bromide 2 (Scheme 1).7 It was found that either thermal or microwave conditions could be successfully employed to couple a diverse range of boronic acids and esters to 5 in the presence of cesium carbonate and a palladium source in DMF. The palladium source of choice was identified as FibrecatÒ 1001 which improved the ease of reaction workup and purification (Scheme 2). Cross screening of a range of the compounds prepared revealed clear SAR for substitution of the terminal aromatic ring (Table 2). Introduction of a para substituent gave clear gains in potency and by suitable choice of Ar it was demonstrated that selectivity could also be varied. Crystallographic analysis4 of 6c suggested that the source of the observed potency gain was water mediated hydrogen bonding interactions to residues at the bottom of the S10 pocket, specifically main chain atoms of Lys233 and Arg249 (Fig. 4). Variation of the complete biaryl fragment was also investigated using a similar reaction sequence to that described in Scheme 1. Starting from a diverse range of commercially available benzylic halides or alcohols a number of analogues of 1 were prepared (7a­d) and subsequently profiled (Table 4). Crystallographic analysis4 of 7a and comparison of its binding mode with that observed for 6c revealed that introduction of a conformational constraint prevented the biaryl system from adopting

(a) IC50 values are given as the average of at least two replicates (n P 2) with values deviating by less than two fold across the range. Assays were conducted using recombinant metalloproteinases from commercial sources, or generated in-house, with fluorescently tagged peptide substrates. Details available on request. (b) Protein for crystallization was obtained by overexpression of MMP12 residues 106­268 in E. coli followed by refolding and standard purification procedures in the presence of a hydroxamate tool compound. Crystals were grown with the tool compound from 100 mM Mes pH 5.2­5.6, 16­ 20% PEG 5KMME and 200 mM ammonium sulfate. The crystals are P1 with approximate cell dimensions of a = 46 Å, b = 65 Å, c = 68 Å, a = 66°, b = 84°, g = 71°. Complexes of 1, 6c and 7a were obtained by replacement soaking of the crystals. For all three complexes, data was collected at Daresbury synchrotron and density for the ligand was clear and unambiguous.

It was possible to specifically oxidize 14 using 1 equiv of mCPBA to give the corresponding racemic sulfoxide 15 and then by treating 15 with a further equivalent of mCPBA to obtain sulfone 16. Cross screening of these compounds was then carried out (Table 3). Whilst the free alcohol was the most potent of the compounds prepared it was demonstrated that a number of viable alternative groups were tolerated. In summary, we have identified a series of potent, selective MMP-12 inhibitors based around a b-hydroxy acid template. The lower affinity zinc binding group (carboxylic acid) allows excellent
