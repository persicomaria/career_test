Figure 8. The crystallographic dimer is formed by interactions between the loop residues 185 to 190, 194 to 195 and residue 222 in one monomer (black) with the corresponding residues in the neighboring monomer (gray). There are two hydrogen bonds with the amino group of residue 188. Elimination of the hydrogen bonds, one at a time, does not inhibit dimer formation in type 2 crystals. (a) Superposition of the N190K mutant structure (thick) onto the wild-type SCP structure (thin). (b) Superposition of the N222L mutant structure (thick) onto the wild-type SCP structure (thin).
