The regulation of the number of 2-subunit-containing GABAA receptors (GABAARs) present at synapses is critical for correct synaptic inhibition and animal behavior. This regulation occurs, in part, by the controlled removal of receptors from the membrane in clathrin-coated vesicles, but it remains unclear how clathrin recruitment to surface 2-subunit-containing GABAARs is regulated. Here, we identify a 2-subunit-specific Yxx -type-binding motif for the clathrin adaptor protein, AP2, which is located within a site for 2-subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. Blocking GABAAR-AP2 interactions via this motif increases synaptic responses within minutes. Crystallographic and biochemical studies reveal that phosphorylation of the Yxx motif inhibits AP2 binding, leading to increased surface receptor number. In addition, the crystal structure provides an explanation for the high affinity of this motif for 2-subunit-containing heteromeric AP2 and suggests that GABAARs may be internalized as dimers or multimers. These data define a mechanism for tyrosine kinase regulation of GABAAR surface levels and synaptic inhibition.

he GABAA receptor (GABAAR), a ligand-gated ion channel, mediates the majority of fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mammalian CNS. Identifying the molecular mechanisms important for regulating these receptors is essential for our understanding of how synaptic inhibition and neuronal excitability are controlled. GABAARs are pentameric heterooligomers assembled from seven subunit classes ( 1­6, 1­3, 1­3, , , , and ). It is generally assumed that the majority of GABAARs in the brain are assembled from at least 2 -, 2 -, and 1 2-subunits (1). The GABAAR 2-subunit confers important pharmacological, functional, and membrane-trafficking properties to GABAARs, including benzodiazepine sensitivity, the selective targeting of GABAARs to inhibitory postsynaptic domains, and correct animal behavior (2, 3). The phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y) residues within the 2-subunit intracellular domain (ICD) at Y365 and Y367 increases GABAAR function. However, the mechanisms that underlie this regulation remain unclear (4, 5). Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that altered membrane trafficking of 2-subunit-containing GABAARs may underlie certain pathological conditions, such as the generation of pharmacoresistance and self-sustaining seizures in status epilepticus and the increased excitotoxicity in ischemia (6­8). Currently, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms and protein interactions that underlie 2subunit-dependent regulation of receptor membrane trafficking under normal or pathological conditions. A potential mechanism to regulate synaptic inhibition is to alter the number of surface and synaptic GABAARs. This

surface receptor number can be determined, in part, by receptor endocytosis and the interaction with the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) complex (9, 10). The AP2 complex is composed of -, 2-, 2-, and 2-adaptin-subunits. The AP2-dependent internalization of neurotransmitter receptors has been demonstrated to underlie alterations in synaptic strength and plasticity (10­18). We have previously shown that GABAAR ICDs interact with AP2 via directly binding to the 2-subunit of AP2 (9, 10). In the case of GABAAR -subunits, the interaction with 2 occurs via an atypical 2 interaction motif and is negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of serine residues within this motif (10). In contrast, the molecular mechanisms of GABAAR -subunit binding to AP2 remain unknown. In this study, we use biochemical, electrophysiological, and structural approaches to characterize a 2-subunit-specific Yxx -type motif responsible for the binding of the AP2 complex to the GABAAR 2-subunit. We demonstrate that the 2subunit ICD can interact directly with 2­A P2 via a Y365GY367ECL370 (Yxx type) AP2-binding motif that mediates high-affinity phospho-dependent binding to 2­AP2. Targeting the YECL­AP2 interaction site by using interfering peptides rapidly increases inhibitory synaptic responses. Simultaneously targeting the YECL­AP2 interaction site in conjunction with the previously identified 3-subunit-binding site results in an additive response. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the YGYECL motif in complex with 2­AP2 provides an explanation for the particularly high affinity of the YGYECL motif for 2­AP2 and intriguingly also suggests that 2-subunitcontaining heteromeric GABAARs may be internalized as dimers or multimers.

putative classical Yxx motif (YECL; residues 367­370) absent in GABAAR -subunits. Peptides containing the Yxx motif from other membrane proteins can effectively bind 2­AP2 in vitro (11, 12). To determine whether the Y367ECL370 motif in the 2-subunit ICD can bind 2­AP2 directly, we synthesized a peptide containing the YECL motif and upstream sequence (YECL-pep) and tested its ability to interact with [35S]-labeled 2­AP2. We immobilized either YECL-pep or a version of this peptide containing Y367 mutated to alanine (A367ECL-pep; control mutant) and looked at binding to a [35S]-labeled fragment of 2­AP2 (residues 158­435). Whereas YECL-pep exhibited robust binding to 2­AP2, virtually no binding could be detected for the AECL mutant peptide or beads alone (Fig. 1A). We also identified the domain of 2­AP2 that mediates binding to the GABAAR 2-subunit YECL motif. The removal of the carboxyl-terminal 30 amino acids of 2­AP2 (or even the mutation of W421 to alanine) (21) is sufficient to disrupt the binding of Yxx -type signals to 2­AP2. A [35S]-labeled carboxyl-terminal truncation of 2­AP2 (residues 158­407) could not bind to YECL-pep (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained

when we examined the ability of bacterially expressed His- 2 to bind YECL-pep beads. His- 2 exhibited significant binding only to YECL-pep, but not to AECL-pep or beads alone (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, His- 2 containing a W421A mutation exhibited substantially reduced interaction with the YECL-pep beads ( 15­20% binding remained). In addition, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to measure the affinity of the YECL-pep 2­AP2 interaction as described previously for several other 2­AP2 interaction motifs (10, 17, 22). Either YECL-pep (wild type) or AECL-pep (mutant used for the reference) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor surface, and their ability to bind recombinant His- 2 was recorded in real time by using an SPR-based biosensor. This approach revealed that YECL-pep bound with a high nanomolar 42.2 nM) (Fig. 1C and D), providing affinity to AP2 (Kd compelling evidence that the 2-subunit-specific YECL motif can mediate high-affinity 2­AP2 binding.

this idea further, we monitored the consequences, on the size of mIPSCs, of simultaneously targeting both these AP2 interaction mechanisms with the GABAAR by using codialysis of 3-pep and YECL-pep. As shown in Fig. 2 A­D, codialysis of YECL-pep with the previously described 3-pep (10) over the same 60-min time course produced a significant additive effect on mIPSC amplitude, compared with interfering with GABAAR­AP2 interactions individually by using 3-pep or YECL-pep alone or codialysed control peptides ( 3-pep plus YECL-pep, 42.8 3.2%, n 6; 3-pep, 28.3 2.3%, n 6; YECL-pep, 21.2 1.9%, n 6; AECL plus 3-phos-pep, 3.4 0.3%, n 6). The control for 3-pep is an identical version of this peptide phosphorylated at two serine residues ( 3-phos-pep) and that no longer interacts with AP2 (10).

specific YECL motif, we carried out whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological experiments to monitor the effects on inhibitory synaptic transmission of dialyzing a YECL motifcontaining peptide [(YECL-pep) which we predicted would compete with AP2 binding and block receptor internalization] into neurons via the patch pipette. The control for these experiments was the identical peptide containing Y367 mutated to A (AECL-pep), which displays dramatically reduced AP2 binding and would therefore not compete with 2-subunitdependent AP2 binding to native receptors. As shown in Fig. 2, control striatal neurons showed a stable mIPSC amplitude within 60 min from the onset of recording (Fig. 1 E and H­J). In contrast, dialysis of the YECL-pep via the patch pipette caused a sustained increase in mIPSC amplitude (but not frequency) over the same 60-min time course (YECL-pep, 20.9 2.4%, n 7; control, 2.8 0.9%, n 7) (Fig. 1 E­G and J). Therefore, we conclude that the YECL 2­AP2-binding motif within GABAAR -subunits plays a critical role in regulating the number of synaptic GABAARs on a relatively rapid time scale. These results also correlate with an increase in the total number of surface GABAARs in cultured neurons treated with a membrane-permeant YECL-pep, compared with control AECL-peptreated neurons, as determined by using surface biotinylation [supporting information (SI) Fig. 6].

have previously identified a major AP2-binding site in the GABAAR 3-subunit distinct from the YECL motif identified in 2-subunits. Disruption of the 3­AP2 interaction [using a 3 AP2-binding motif peptide ( 3-pep)] enhances the amplitude of mIPSCs in a similar fashion to what is seen here for dialysis of the YECL-pep (10), suggesting that both these 2­AP2 interaction mechanisms are important for regulating the number of -containing GABAARs.

the interaction of the YECL motif and its surrounding residues with 2­AP2, we cocrystallized a 10-aa peptide (DEEYGYECLD) corresponding to GABAAR 2-subunit (residues 362­ 371) with the cargo-binding domain of 2­AP2 (residues 157­ 435; 2 157). The structure of the GABAAR YECL-pep complexed with 2 157 was determined at a resolution of 2.5 Å (SI Table 1). Amino acid groups Glu2OE, Tyr6OH, Glu7O, N, and Leu9N of the YECL-pep interacted with 2­AP2 (residues 157­435) amino acid groups Asp176OD, Lys203NZ, Lys319NZ, Lys420O, Val220O, N, Arg423NE, and NH1 as determined by electron density for peptide residues Asp-1 (D362) to Asp-10 (D371) (see Fig. 3 A and B and SI Table 2; for stereoview of 2 157 complexed with YECL-pep, see SI Fig. 7), which encompasses the canonical tyrosine Yxx endocytic signal 6YECL9. GABA R YECL-pep binds at the identical surface A location identified for the binding of the FYRALM and DYQRLN hexapeptides corresponding to the canonical Yxx motifs of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and trans-Golgi network protein 38 (TGN-38), respectively (23), with Y367 and L370 sitting in chemically compatible pockets and playing key roles in mediating the interaction (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the structure (Fig. 3 A and B) revealed additional interactions between 2­AP2 and residues upstream of the canonical Y367 residue. Specifically, 2-subunit residues D361-Y365 (Asp-1, Glu-2, Glu-3, and Tyr-4) interact with residues Leu-316, Lys-319, Gln-318, Glu-391, Val-392, Pro-393, and Ile-425 of the 2­AP2 subdomain A (Fig. 3 A and B). Similarly to Y367 (Tyr-6), a hydrophobic pocket is formed for Y365 (Tyr-4) (Fig. 3 A and B), with an additional salt bridge between Lys-319 and Glu-2 (see SI Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, our structural data reveal that, in addition to Y367 within the YECL motif, the upstream Y365 residue also plays a role as an additional specificity determinant of YECLpep binding to 2­AP2, similar to the three-pin plug mechanism reported for the association of a 2­AP2 Yxx -binding peptide derived from the membrane protein P-selectin (24). Overall, 111 atomic contacts (2­5 Å) formed between 2 157 and GABAARYECL-pep, compared with the 18 contacts formed by FYRALM (see SI Tables 1­4). A comparison of calculated contact surface areas for binding of YECL-pep and FYRALM-pep (CCP4 program ArealMol) shows an increase of 44% in contact surface area for GABAARYECL-pep [505 Å2 (YECL) vs. 350 Å2 (FYRALM)] (SI Fig. 8 and SI Table 4). The largest increase in contact areas is contributed by Leu-316, Gln-318, Lys-319, Glu-391, Val-392, Pro-393, and Ile-425 (Fig. 3B). Only His-416 shows a larger surface contact with FYRALM-pep. In the case of GABAARYECL-pep, His-416 has moved out of the binding pocket and no longer contributes to the van der Waals surface. 2­AP2 can form dimers, which could increase the strength and specificity of binding to dimeric receptors (23). Even larger differences are observed when the binding characteristics are

GABAARYECL-pep exhibits direct molecular interactions with residues Arg-170, Phe-174, Ile-419, and Trp-421 of the other monomer within the crystallographic dimer (see Fig. 4B and SI Table 3), which form additional binding pockets around the peptide residues Tyr-6 (Y367) and Glu-2 (E368). No such interactions exist in the case of the FYRALM­ 2 complex. Furthermore, the alignment of the two GABAAR YECL-pep dimers allows for the formation of one salt bridge (lys319NZ. . . Glu7OE) (SI Tables 2 and 3), which also is absent in the FYRALM­ 2 complex.

major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in the GABAAR and are substrates of SRC family tyrosine kinases both in vitro and in vivo (4, 5). The crystallographic data predict that phosphorylation at Y367 within the YGYECL motif would preclude 2-binding because there is insufficient space to accommodate a phosphate group within the binding pocket (and, in addition, D473 within 2­AP2 would repel binding), as has been shown previously for other tyrosine motif-AP2 interactions (11, 12, 23). In addition, the YECL peptide­ 2­AP2 structure reveals that, because Y365 also contributes to 2­AP2 binding (by hydrogen bonding with E391), phosphorylation at this site also may negatively regulate 2­AP2 binding because phospho-Y365 would repel the interaction with E391. To test whether phosphorylation of Y365 and/or Y367 can indeed inhibit binding to 2­AP2, we immobilized either the

AP2 is regulated by phosphorylation and consequently predict that phosphorylation of Y365 and/or Y367 would block YGYECLdependent, AP2-mediated internalization and result in an increase in surface receptor number (in agreement with earlier reports that SRC phosphorylation of Y365/Y367 enhances receptor function) (4). It has been reported that in cortical neurons blocking tyrosine phosphatase activity by orthovanadate leads to a large increase in phosphorylation at Y365 and Y367 (5). To test whether treatment of cortical neurons with orthovanadate (increasing Y365/Y367 phosphorylation) (5) also resulted in an increase in the number of surface GABAAR as would be predicted from the above results, we used surface biotinylation of cultured neurons, which, as we have previously shown, is an effective reporter of surface receptor number (25). Orthovanadate treatment produced a statistically significant increase of 159.7 11% of control (P 0.05, n 6) in the cell-surface number of GABAARs (Fig. 5 D and E). Together these results provide evidence that phosphorylation of Y365 and Y367 can directly regulate 2­AP2-binding affinity and the number of surface GABAARs. Discussion Here, we reveal several key issues relating to the functional modulation of 2-subunit-containing GABAARs. Using a combination of biochemical, crystallographic, and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrate that a YECL motif in the 2-subunit mediates interaction with the clathrin AP2 adaptor and that this YECL motif­AP2 interaction is important for the accumulation of synaptic GABAARs. The YECL motif interacts with the 2­AP2 Yxx motif-binding pocket, which is critically dependent on the C-terminal 28 residues in 2­AP2, but independent of the basic patch interaction site in subdomain B of 2 previously reported to interact with GABAAR -subunits and AMPARs (10, 17). Cocrystallization of a decapeptide containing the 2-subunit YECL motif with the signal-binding domain (residues 156­435) of 2­AP2 revealed that the YECL motif binds in a similar manner to 2­AP2 as to the canonical motifs from EGFR and TGN-38 (23), with Y367 and L370 sitting in chemically compatible pockets and playing key roles in mediating the interaction. Importantly, Y367 appears to be a major determinant of the interaction because binding is substantially lost upon mutagenesis of this residue to alanine. Moreover, it was apparent that several upstream residues (notably Y365) act as additional specificity determinants of the interaction by binding into a third pocket on the 2­AP2 protein surface formed by the aliphatic portions of Gln-318, Glu-391, and Pro-393. The additional interaction mediated by Y365 also may explain the high affinity of 2-subunit Yxx motif revealed by SPR (42.2 nM) (26) and is 8-fold higher than that previously reported by using SPR for the AP2-binding domain within the GABAAR 3subunit (300 nM) (10). It has been reported previously that 2­AP2 can form dimers that could increase the strength and specificity of binding to dimeric receptors (23). Of significant interest, our current study demonstrates that the GABAAR-derived YECL-pep forms van der Waals interactions with residues Arg-170, Phe-174, Ile-419, and Trp-421 of the 2­AP2 crystallographic dimer. These residues provide additional binding pockets for the peptide residues Tyr-6 (Y367) and Glu-2 (E363). Furthermore, the alignment of the two GABAAR YECL-pep dimers allows for the formation of four electrostatic interactions. Because only one 2-subunit is present per GABAAR heteromer, the 2-subunitcontaining receptors may be internalized as dimeric or multimeric clusters of receptors. In agreement with the possibility that heteromeric GABAARs containing 2-subunits may be able to dimerize and form clusters, it has been reported that the ICD of 2-subunits can self-associate (27), which would allow two

YECL-pep or a version of this peptide that had been chemically phosphorylated on Y365 and Y367 (YGYECL-phos) onto beads and looked at binding to [35S]-labeled 2­AP2. YECL-pep exhibited robust binding to 2­AP2 in this assay (in agreement with the results using SPR), whereas a peptide that was chemically phosphorylated on both Y365 and Y367 bound virtually no [35S]-labeled 2­AP2 (Fig. 5A). We carried out similar experiments to test the binding of the tyrosine motif peptides in their phosphorylated or unphosphorylated forms to AP2 from brain lysate by using SDS/PAGE and detection of bound AP2 by either Coomassie blue staining followed by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis of bands from bound complexes or Western blotting with AP2 antibodies. When an unphosphorylated version of the peptide containing the YECL motif was coupled to beads and then exposed to brain lysate, Coomassie blue staining of bound protein complexes analyzed by SDS/PAGE revealed major interacting bands associated with this peptide at 50 and 115 kDa (these bands represent the correct molecular weight for the 2and -subunits of AP2, respectively) (see Fig. 5B, lane 1). That these bands represented AP2 subunits was confirmed by the excision of the bands, followed by Maldi-TOF mass spectrometry, further confirming the ability of the YECL-pep to strongly interact with brain AP2. In contrast to the unphosphorylated peptide, binding of AP2 to a peptide phosphorylated on Y365 was reduced (as shown by much weaker Coomassie blue-stained bands at 50 and 115 kDa). A more substantial reduction in the interaction was observed when the peptide was phosphorylated on Y367, whereas the greatest reduction was seen with the diphosphorylated peptide (Y365phos and Y367phos), which showed essentially no AP2 binding (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained by Western blot analysis of YECL-pep brain pulldown assays by using an antibody to 2­AP2 (Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that YGYECL motif binding to

YECL motifs to come together within a dimerized 2­AP2 complex. Dialysis of the YECL peptide (with a high affinity for AP2) into neurons significantly increased the amplitude of mIPSCs within tens of minutes, demonstrating that AP2 binding to 2-subunits underlies the dynamic modulation of synaptic GABAAR number. Importantly, we demonstrate that the previously described -subunit AP2-binding mechanism (10) and the 2-subunit-specific YECL­AP2-binding mechanism described here can act either separately or together to modulate synaptic GABAAR number because simultaneously targeting both AP2 interaction mechanisms had a substantial additive effect on the inhibitory synaptic response. These results clearly demonstrate that synaptic GABAAR number can be controlled by at least two mechanisms for AP2-dependent receptor recruitment into the internalization pathway, one of which is 2subunit-selective. There is accumulating evidence that the phosphorylation of GABAAR ICDs may regulate receptor cell-surface number (28). The crystal structure presented here reveals that phosphorylation of either Y365 and/or Y367 has a negative regulatory role on the binding affinity of AP2 to the YGYECL motif, which we confirm biochemically and which also has been suggested for other Yxx -type interactions (23). Previous work showed that phosphorylation of Y365 and Y367 by the tyrosine kinase SRC both in vitro and in vivo enhances the receptor function in line with our current results (4, 5). We suggest that, in part, this functional enhancement may be due to phosphorylation at Y365 and Y367 inhibiting interaction with AP2, which we demonstrate here increases the number of surface (and potentially synaptic) GABA A Rs. Therefore, our work highlights a phosphodependent mechanism to regulate GABAAR cell-surface levels and synaptic inhibition by tyrosine phosphorylation of 2subunits. Alterations in the phosphorylation state of Y365 and/or Y367 within the 2-subunit during synaptic plasticity or in pathology may therefore underlie dynamic alterations in synaptic receptor number (6, 7, 29). Importantly, the insights presented here and the structural data within this study could pave the way for the development of acute chemical inhibitors that could be used to selectively block pathological 2-subunit-dependent receptor internalization. We have previously shown that phosphorylation at conserved serine residues (S408 and S409) in the GABAAR 3-subunits also can act as a molecular switch to regulate 2­AP2 recruitment and the number of GABAARs at inhibitory synapses (10, 30).

binding mechanisms in the - and -subunits is not clear, but the fact that the GABAAR 3-subunit and 2-subunit AP2-binding motifs are regulated by different kinase families (i.e., serine/ threonine or tyrosine kinase for - and 2-subunits, respectively) suggests that this dual binding mechanism may have evolved as a mechanism to allow for a tight regulation of AP2 binding (and therefore internalization kinetics) by multiple signaling cascades that converge at the level of direct receptor phosphorylation. This mechanism would allow for the coordinated regulation via multiple separate signaling pathways of GABAAR cell-surface number by controlling the stoichiometry of -subunit and/or -subunit phosphorylation and, subsequently, the kinetics of receptor endocytosis, with critical consequences on the efficacy of inhibitory synaptic transmission (28). Materials and Methods
Antibodies and cDNA Constructs, Neuronal Culture, and Biotinylation Assays. Cultures and biotinylation of cortical neurons were performed as described previously (25). Antibodies to AP2 and GABAARs and plasmids to the GABAAR subunit ICDs fused to GST, and the subunits of AP2 have been described previously (10, 13). Detection of AP-2 -Chain Binding to GABAAR 2-Subunit YECL Peptides by Affinity Pulldown and SPR Assays. SPR, affinity purification from rat brain lysate, [35S]-labeled, or purified proteins with peptides linked to CH-Sepharose beads were performed essentially as described in a number of previous studies (see SI Materials and Methods) (10, 13, 31). Crystallography of the 2­AP2 GABAAR YECL-Pep Interaction. X-ray data for 2 YECL-pep crystals was collected at PSF beamline BL2 of Freie Universitat Berlin at BESSY/Berlin and processed by using HKL2000 (32) and scalepack. The phase problem was solved by molecular replacement with CCP4 program molrep (33) by using Mu2 Adaptin Subunit (PDB ID code 1BW8) without water and ligand atoms as model (23). After rigid body refinement, the R value was 36.5% (Rfree 39.5%) for data between 40- and 3.0-Å resolution. Subsequent cycles of isotropic B value and positional refinement to 2.51-Å resolution were performed by using Refmac5 (34). The peptide chain and the missing residues were built manually by using the model-building program, Coot (for additional details, see SI Materials and Methods) (35). Whole-Cell Recordings. Whole-cell recordings of mIPSCs from striatal neurons in acute slices used standard voltage-clamp techniques in the presence of 20 M CNQX and 40 M APV to block AMPA and NMDA receptors, respectively (see also SI Materials and Methods) (10, 25, 30).
