Structures of Ser205 mutant plasmepsin II from Ê Plasmodium falciparum at 1.8 A in complex with the inhibitors rs367 and rs370
Plasmepsin II is one of the four catalytically active plasmepsins found in the food vacuole of Plasmodium falciparum. These enzymes initiate hemoglobin degradation by cleavage at the -chain between Phe33 and Leu34. The crystal structures of Ser205 mutant plasmepsin II from P. falciparum in complex with two inhibitors have been Ê re®ned at a resolution of 1.8 A in the space group I222 and to R factors of 19.9 and 19.5%. Each crystal contains one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Both inhibitors have a Phe± Leu core and incorporate tetrahedral transition-state mimetic hydroxypropylamine. The inhibitor rs367 possesses a 2,6-dimethylphenyloxyacetyl group at the P2 position and 3-aminobenzamide at the P2H position, while rs370 has the same P2 group but 4-aminobenzamide in the P2H position. These complexes reveal key conserved hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and the binding-cavity residues, notably with the ¯ap residues Val78 and Ser79, the catalytic dyad Asp34 and Asp214 and the residues Ser218 and Gly36 that are in proximity to the catalytic dyad. The structures also show unexpected conformational variability of the binding cavity of plasmepsin II and may re¯ect the mode of binding of the hemoglobin -chain for cleavage.

1. Introduction
Plasmepsin II, the ®rst protein from a protozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium for which the structure was determined, is an aspartic protease involved in hemoglobin degradation (Silva et al., 1996). Different species of Plasmodium are the etiologic agents of malaria, a devastating human disease af¯icting several hundred million people a year and killing an estimated two million of them, mostly children (World Health Organization, 1995). Plasmodium species, such as P. falciparum and P. vivax, cause disease in the intraerythrocytic phase of malaria. During this phase, the parasite consumes nearly all the host's hemoglobin to generate amino acids for its growth and maturation (Francis et al., 1997). This is a vast catabolic process, since hemoglobin constitutes 95% of the soluble erythrocytic protein. Hemoglobin is degraded by a series of proteases in an acidic digestive vacuole. This sequential process is initiated by aspartic proteases called plasmepsins. Two such homologous enzymes termed plasmepsin I and II (PLM I and PLM II) make an initial attack on the hemoglobin -chain between residues 33 and 34. This initial attack is followed by cleavage by the cysteine protease falcipain, which allows further degradation of hemoglobin by other proteases in the food vacuole. The products of digestive-vacuole proteolysis are

with mammalian aspartic proteases such as cathepsin D (Francis et al., 1994). The structures of PLM II from P. falciparum in complex with pepstatin A (Silva et al., 1996), plasmepsin from P. vivax in complex with pepstatin A and N-truncated pro-PLM II from P. falciparum (Bernstein et al., 1999) have been determined by X-ray crystallographic techniques. All three sets of coordinates have been deposited in the RSCB Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1sme, 1qs8 and 1pfs, respectively. Inhibitors of PLM II that have low nanomolar inhibition constant values and are lethal against cultured malarial parasites have been identi®ed (Carroll, Johnson et al., 1998; Carroll & Orlowski, 1998; Carroll, Patel et al., 1998; Goldberg, 1992; Goldberg et al., 1991; Haque et al., 1999; Silva et al., 1996, 1998; Westling et al., 1999). Furthermore, some aspartic and cysteine protease inhibitors demonstrate an apparent synergistic inhibition of hemoglobin degradation in both culture and a murine malaria model (Semenov et al., 1998). Thus, aspartyl and cysteine protease inhibitors could provide an array of new antimalarial drugs to confront the problems of widespread drug resistance facing the current therapeutics. We present here the structures of complexes of PLM II from P. falciparum with new inhibitors. Since the inhibitors have a Phe±Leu core, they provide a view of the possible conformation of the enzyme when the natural substrate hemoglobin is bound.

small peptides, which appear to be exported for terminal degradation by cytoplasmic exopeptidases (Goldberg et al., 1991; Gluzman et al., 1994; Dame et al., 1994; Francis et al., 1994). Intact hemoglobin cannot be cleaved by falcipain unless the substrate is ®rst denatured (Francis et al., 1996). Cysteine protease inhibitors cause osmotic swelling of the digestive vacuole and ultimately result in the death of the parasite (Rosenthal et al., 1991). This may occur through the accumulation of digestion products that are too large to exit the vacuole (Francis et al., 1996). Both PLM I and PLM II are capable of making an initial cleavage in the hemoglobin -chain between Phe33 and Leu34 (Gluzman et al., 1994; Goldberg et al., 1991). This bond is also the ®rst to be cleaved when hemoglobin is incubated with an extract of puri®ed digestive vacuoles (Goldberg et al., 1991). This cleavage leads to unraveling of the hemoglobin molecule, allowing further proteolysis to proceed ef®ciently. The plasmepsins are capable of several other cleavages after the initial event (Gluzman et al., 1994). Of the ten plasmepsins that have been identi®ed in the genome of P. falciparum, only four of them are active in the food vacuole during the intra-erythrocytic stage. These four are PLM I, PLM II, PLM IV and HAP, an aspartic protease with histidine in the active site (Banerjee et al., 2002). PLM I and PLM II are 73% identical to each other, while their mature coding regions share about 64% identity with PLM IV and 60% identity with HAP, but only about 30±35% identity

The expression and puri®cation of PLM II was carried out as described previously (Gulnik et al., 2002). Solvent-exposed Met205 was substituted with Ser, which is less tolerated in the hydrophobic S1 subsite of the enzyme and thus reduces the chances of autolysis of the protein during puri®cation. The mutant enzyme retained its full catalytic activity. Protein from the Ser205 mutant, rather than the wild type, was used for crystallographic experiments (Gulnik et al., 2002). The crystals were grown at 293 K by vapor diffusion in hanging drops. Drops were prepared by mixing 2 ml of protein±inhibitor solution with an equal volume of the appropriate reservoir solution. The protein±inhibitor solution was comprised of 5 mg mlÀ1 protein in 10 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.0 and 7 mM inhibitor in 10% DMSO. The reservoir solutions for the complexes of PLM II with both rs367 and rs370 contained 0.10 M sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0, 0.20 M phosphate buffer, 18% (NH4)2SO4 and 5% ethanol. Large well ordered crystals grew in several days.
2.2. Data collection

Crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant mother liquor containing 25% glycerol prior to ¯ash-freezing at 100 K in a stream of N2 gas. Crystals of both the PLM II±rs367 and Ê PLM II±rs370 complexes diffracted to about 1.8 A resolution. These orthorhombic crystals belonged to the space group I222 and have similar unit-cell parameters: a = 76.0, b = 85.5,

Ê Ê c = 123.4 A for the former and a = 75.9, b = 84.8, c = 123.4 A for the latter. Both data sets were collected at beamline X9B at Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source using a MAR 345 detector (MAR Research). X-ray data sets were processed using the programs DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993a) and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993b).
2.3. Refinement

The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). The search model was Ê obtained by stripping a monomer from the 2.7 A structure of PLM II complexed with pepstatin A of its ligand and water molecules (Silva et al., 1996). The initial R factors of the unre®ned solution from AMoRe were 34% (free R factor 42%) and 32% (free R factor 40%) for the PLM II±rs367 and

PLM II±rs370 complexes, respectively. Iterative cycles of model building into the 2Fo À Fc omit electron-density maps with the program O (Jones et al., 1991) and structure re®neÊ ment were carried out. The models were re®ned to 2.0 A using both positional re®nement and simulated annealing with È X-PLOR (Adams et al., 1997; Brunger, 1992a,b; Brunger et al., 1997, 1990). This was followed with re®nement cycles to the Ê full resolution limit of 1.8 A with the CNS maximumlikelihood re®nement procedure using Engh and Huber È geometric parameters (Adams et al., 1997; Brunger, 1992a,b; È Brunger et al., 1997, 1990). The re®ned models each include one protein molecule and one inhibitor molecule as well as 339 water molecules, with R factors of 19.9% (free R factor 26.6%) and 19.5% (free R factor 25.8%) for the complexes with rs367 and rs370, respectively. The data and model statistics are summarized in Table 1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Quality of the models

The quality of the ®nal models is summarized in Table 1. The stereochemical quality of the structures as assessed by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) are excellent and all main-chain and side-chain parameters are either better than Ê or as expected for 1.8 A structures. The Ramanchandran plot for the PLM II±rs367 complex shows that only 1.4% of the residues are in the disallowed regions, with all the rest lying in the allowed regions; for PLM II±rs370 only 1.7% lie in the disallowed region. All main-chain and side-chain atoms ®t well into the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map. Examples of the quality of these maps are shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1

As part of our HIV protease-inhibitor program, we designed and synthesized inhibitors that incorporate a symmetry-based transition-state mimetic hydroxypropyl amine (Phe±Phe) isostere. These retroviral aspartic protease inhibitors were screened against PLM II. The results were encouraging since several non-peptidic small-molecularweight P2±P2H compounds exhibited submicromolar inhibition constants against PLM II. In an attempt to further improve potency, we turned our attention to the initial Phe±Leu cleavage-site region in the hemoglobin -chain. On the basis of the above substrate speci®city, we designed a Phe±Leu core incorporating tetrahedral transition-state mimetic hydroxypropylamine. We were able to co-crystallize PLMII with two of these inhibitors. The two inhibitors are 3-amino-N-{4(2,6-dimethyl-phenoxy)acetylamino]-3-hydroxy-1-isobutyl-5-phenyl-pentyl}-benzamide, otherwise known as rs367, and 4-amino-N-{4(2,6-dimethyl-phenoxy)-acetylamino]-3-hydroxy-1-isobutyl-5-phenylpentyl}-benzamide, referred to as rs370. The structural formulae are shown in Fig. 2. Rs367, possessing a 2,6-dimethylphenyloxyacetyl group at the P2 position and a 3-aminobenzamide at the P2H position, exhibited a PLM II inhibition Ki of about an order of magnitude better than the

corresponding inhibitors possessing a Phe±Phe core. There is negligible difference in the inhibition-constant values of both rs367 and rs370 against PLM II, with inhibition-constant values of 18 nM for the former and 30 nM for the latter. Further modi®cation to the P2H position provided other analogs with low nanomolar potency, thus establishing the Phe±Leu derivatives as an interesting series of lead inhibitors. Data from an extensive inhibitor study will be published elsewhere (Gulnik et al., unpublished results).
3.3. General features of the models

r.m.s. deviation on overlapping the main-chain atoms of the Ê two models is 0.201 A. The r.m.s. deviations were calculated using the program LSQKAB (Kabsch, 1976) within the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4,

PLM II displays the characteristic folding of eukaryotic aspartic proteases which has been observed from mammalian enzymes such as human pepsin, renin, gastricsin and cathepsin D to the fungal enzymes endothiapepsin and rizopuspepsin. The main secondary-structure features of PLM II are retained regardless of which inhibitor is bound. The molecule is formed by a single chain of 329 amino acids and is folded into two topologically similar N- and C-terminal domains. The domains contact each other along the bottom of the binding cleft that contains the catalytic dyad, Asp34 and Asp214. A singlehairpin structure, known as the `¯ap', lies perpendicular over the binding cleft and interacts with bound inhibitors and presumably substrates. The amino and carboxyl ends of the polypeptide chain of PLM II are assembled into a characteristic six-stranded interdomain -sheet, which serves to anchor the domains together (Fig. 3a). The structures of the PLM II±rs367 and PLM II±rs370 complexes are virtually identical except for the difference in the position of the amino groups in the P2H inhibitors. The

The minor dimer is represented by the interactions along the other twofold axis of symmetry and involve in one case the yellow and magenta monomers and in the other the aquamarine and blue monomers. The interactions across this axis of symmetry are mediated by the proline-rich loop from one monomer, which comes into proximity to the binding cavity of the other.

Surface plots of structures of PLM II in complex with (a) rs367, (b) rs370 and (c) pepstatin A. The protein surface is highly negatively charged and has two regions of positive charge. In addition, the binding cavity of the complex with pepstatin A is completely closed, while the other two are open.

Figure 4

1994). These values are quite low and suggest that the models are almost identical. The binding cavity is lined with water molecules, one of which assumes alternate positions depending on the position of the amino group and could be said to take the place of the amino group as it is moved from the 3H to the 4H position. The location of this water molecule is clearly de®ned in the 2Fo ÀFc electron-density maps (Fig. 1). The only difference between the inhibitors is the location of a single amino group on the P2H group. The inhibitor rs370 is para-substituted, whereas rs367 is meta-substituted. As the inhibitors are so similar, it is not surprising that the resulting crystals are also very similar and have similar unit-cell parameters. They both crystallized in the same space group I222, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. I222 symmetry generates a tetramer and there are three possible dimer interfaces. Two have signi®cant buried areas, whereas the third Ê has negligible buried area, 82 A2 in total. The major dimer Ê interface has the largest total buried surface area, 4427 A2. The major dimer involves an extensive interlocking of the monomers along the crystallographic twofold (Fig. 3b). The greater proportion of the dimer interface is hydrophobic, Ê Ê 3455 A2, while a lesser proportion is hydrophilic, 852 A2. A loop region comprised of the residues Val236±Tyr245 forms a central part of the major crystallographic dimer interface and is in proximity to both the pro-loop and the ¯ap. Furthermore, this loop from each monomer of the major dimer is in proximity to the inhibitor of the other monomer of the major dimer. The minor crystallographic dimer (Fig. 3b) has a total buried Ê area of 1699 A2 and brings loop 290±297 of one monomer into proximity to the binding cavity of the other. The major and minor crystallographic dimer interactions for the structure of the PLM II±rs367 complex are virtually identical to those of the structure of the PLM II±rs370 complex. The only difference between both structures is in minor dimer interactions at the active site, where there is now an additional hydrogen bond. Moving the amine from the para to the meta position brings it closer to the pro-loop of a

Ê symmetry-related monomer and leads to a 2.6 A hydrogen bond between Pro295 and the amine group. No discernable gains have been observed from this additional hydrogen bond, as there is a negligible difference in the inhibition constants.

Pepstatin A, rs367 and rs370 are presently three of the most potent inhibitors of PLM II. In the structures of PLM II

complexed with these inhibitors, the active site is ¯anked on one side by primarily hydrophobic residues and on the other side mostly by hydrophilic residues. All three structural complexes have negatively charged surfaces with a net negative charge in the binding cavity (Fig. 4). There are two regions of positive charge on the surface of both structures, one of which is centralized around the highly variable ¯exible loop Val236±Tyr245. The ¯exible loop is the region of highest variability in eukaryotic aspartic proteases and adopts a different conformation with the Phe± Leu-based inhibitors than with pepstatin A (Fig. 5). The r.m.s. deviations of the overlap of the PLM II±rs367 and PLM II± rs370 complexes with the PLM II±pepstatin A complex model Ê are 0.97 and 0.98 A, respectively, for one monomer and 1.23 Ê , respectively, for the second monomer. The regions and 1.24 A of highest variability between the structures are the ¯exible loop and the binding cavity (Fig. 5). The binding cavities of the structures of both the PLM II± rs367 and PLM II±rs370 complexes are more open than that of the structure of the PLM II±pepstatin A complex. It appears that the extensive interactions within the binding pocket of the PLM II±pepstatin A complex results in a complete embrace of the inhibitor (Fig. 4b). Such a tight embrace of the inhibitor is quite unlike the more relaxed and open binding cavity of the other two structures. The conformational ¯exibility of the binding cavity is indicative of the need for more structural information to enhance structure-based drug-design studies and suggests that the complex structure of PLM II±pepstatin A is insuf®cient by itself for the thorough comprehension of the mode of binding of different classes of inhibitors. Furthermore, we have determined the structure of uncomplexed PLM II and the binding cavity is even more open than those of both the PLM II±rs367 and PLM II±rs370 complexes (Asojo et al., unpublished results). This suggests that the binding cavity starts out wider and more relaxed and closes down to embrace the different inhibitors that are bound. A closer examination of the binding cavity of the PLM II± rs367 and PLM II±rs370 complexes reveals that the S1 and S1H subsites conform well to accept the Phe and Leu residues (Fig. 6). It also becomes evident that there is suf®cient room in the binding cavity for peptides of a much larger size than our inhibitors. In fact, it is possible to ®t hemoglobin -helix 21±36 into the binding cavity and at the same time the substrate residues Phe33 and Leu34 can be aligned with the corresponding inhibitor core (Fig. 7). There is no room for the hemoglobin -helix to ®t in the PLM II cavity in the conformation adopted when the inhibitor pepstatin A is bound

A closer look into the binding cavity of PLM II in complex with (a) rs370 and (b) pepstatin A. In the case of the latter, the cavity collapses completely as a result of the tight network of interactions with pepstatin A. The S1 and S1H subsites of the former conform to accept the Phe and Leu residues and show a possible conformation of the binding cavity in the presence of the intended occupants.

The substrate helix (magenta) ®ts into the binding cavity of PLM II±rs370 (aquamarine). It is interesting to note that the Phe±Leu cleavage site of the substrate overlays well with the Phe±Leu core of the inhibitor.

(Fig. 5). This suggests that the relaxed conformation adopted by PLM II when either rs367 or rs370 are bound is more representative of the conformation of the substrate-bound enzyme than the conformation adopted when pepstatin A is bound. There are fewer hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor rs370 and the binding cavity than observed in the PLM II±pepstatin A complex structure. This is as expected because rs370 is a smaller inhibitor with fewer hydrophilic groups than pepstatin A. Nonetheless, the hydrogen-bond contacts between the catalytic dyad are maintained at similar distances to those in the other complex structures (Fig. 8). Other conserved hydrogen bonds include those from the ¯ap residues Val78 and Ser79, both of which are observed in the PLM II± pepstatin A complex structures. The hydrogen bond with Tyr192 is now reduced to a much weaker bond. There is also an additional hydrogen bond from Leu131 at a Ê distance of 2.86 A. This hydrogen bond is not observed in the PLM II±pepstatin A structure. The pattern of hydrogen bonding in the binding cavity of the structure of the PLM II±rs367 complex is virtually identical to that in the structure of the PLM II±rs370 complex.
3.5. Concluding remarks

Our structural studies indicate that there is signi®cant conformational ¯exibility in the binding cavity of PLM II.
