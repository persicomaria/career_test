INTRODUCTION

Regulatory subunits R of protein kinase A (PKA) have been purified from various sources with the aid of CAMP affinity chromatography (Ramseyer et al., 1974; Severin et al., 1974; Weber and Hilz, 1978). When we applied this procedure to bovine kidney, we observed that immobilized CAMP retained two additional proteins which were present in much higher amounts than R subunits. They could be identified as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and as subunits of nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), respectively.

Although the two enzymes apparently are not involved in the same biological processes, they both exhibit a remarkable affinity to immobilized CAMP residues. This offered a simple method to isolate the two enzymes from cells and tissues. Such a procedure may have considerable significance: both enzymes encountered a renaissance of interest because of recently discovered functions surpassing their roles in intermediary metabolism. Thus, GAPDH was shown to participate in such diverse processes as DNA repair (MeyerSiegler et al., 1991), protein phosphorylation (Kawamoto et al., 1986), formation of triad junctions (Caswell et al., 1985) and export of nuclear RNA (Singh and Green, 1993), besides glycolysis. And nuciecvside diphosphate kinase may not only be respansible for the maintenance of energy-rich nucleotides. NDK

Recently, Postel et al. (1993) presented evidence that NDK (isoform B) is a myc transcription factor. To facilitate further insights in these interesting functions of the two enzymes, we describe here a simple and efficient purification procedure based on the affinity of these unrelated enzymes to CAMP matrices. It allows the sequential isolation of the proteins directly from cell or tissue extracts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Isolation of GAPDH muscle fractions

and NDK ,from rabbit

Skeletal muscle (1.16 kg) was homogenized and the extract chromatographed on DEAE cellulose as described by Beavo et al. (1974). The PKA peak I fraction (420 ml, 2.5 g protein) was incubated with 5 ml thio CAMP-Agarose for 2 hr at room temperature, the matrix packed into a column, and washed successively with two column volumes each of buffer A and 2 M NaCl in buffer A. GAPDH was eluted with 1 or 10 mM AMP (2 vol). After washing with buffer A and 1 mM CAMP, NDK was desorbed with 30 mM CAMP at 4" (fraction 1: one column volume; fraction 2: three column volumes). R proteins could be finally eluted with 30 mM CAMP at 30" (2 hr).
Isolation of GAPDH and NDK from yeast

Materials

Thio CAMP agarose matrix was synthesized (see below) or obtained from Sigma (Miinchen), &BrcAMP, N6-aminohexylaminoCAMP, CAMP, trypsin, and endoprotease AspN (sequencing grade) from Boehringer (Mannheim), and epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B from Pharmacia (Freiburg). 8-(2'-hydroxyethyl)-thioCAMP was synthesized as described in (Munayama et al., 1971).
AfJinity chromatography (general procedure) on thio CAMP matrices

Prior to the application of extracts, the matrix was equilibrated with buffer A (10 mM Trisacetate pH 7.5-6 mM 2-mercapto ethanol1 mM EDTA-10% glycerol). Extracts or enzyme solutions were slowly passed (0.1 ml/ min) over the affinity column (40 x 8 mm), and the column was washed with buffer A and 2 M NaCl in buffer A (2- 3 matrix Vol each). GAPDH was then eluted with 2 mM AMP in buffer A (3 matrix Vol). Subsequently, the matrix was resuspended in 1 Vol 10mM CAMP in buffer A, and the bulk of NDK was desorbed with 30mM CAMP in buffer A (2 matrix Vol at 0.3 ml/min). If desired, regulatory subunits of protein kinase A can be eluted with cold 5 M urea in buffer A [CAMP binding remains intact under these conditions when subsequently diluted to l-2 M urea (Weber and Hilz, 1978; Weber et al., 197911, or with 30mM CAMP after incubation for at least 2 hr at 30".

Yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; 5 g) were washed twice with water, suspended in 40 ml extraction buffer (30 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.4-20 mM benzamidine-4 mM EDTA150 U/ml Aprotinin-10% glycerol), and sonicated with glass beads in pre-cooled containers in a "Dismembrator" (Eckstein et al., 1967) (30 set pre-cooling with CO*, 90 set sonication with continuous cooling). The homogenate was filtered through a glass frit, the glass beads rinsed with 10 ml extraction buffer, and the combined filtrates frozen at -80" until use. The soluble fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation of the homogenate (112,000 g; 30 min). 30 ml of the clear extract were passed over a thio CAMP column (5 ml matrix) at room temperature. The column was washed with 10 ml buffer A and 10 ml 2 M NaCl in buffer A (0.2 ml/min). 15 ml 2 mM AMP in buffer A was then applied followed by 15 ml each of 15 mM CAMP and 30 mM CAMP, respectively, in buffer A. In some experiments, extracts were treated with a charcoal suspension (100 mg charcoal per ml 50 mM Hepes pH = 7.4-5 mM EDTA-0.5% bovine serum albumin; 0.3 ml/ml extract) before affinity chromatography.
Other extracts

HeLa cell extracts were obtained by sonication (90 set) of 7 x lo7 cells (procedure a) or .I x lo7 cells (procedure b) per ml extraction buffer and centrifugation (112,000 g; 30 min) (cf. Beavo et al., 1974). 6-12ml extract (procedure a), or 140 ml extract (procedure b) was

chromatographed on a 5 ml thio CAMP matrix column (cf. Weber et al., 1982) as described for yeast extract. Bovine thyroid and bovine kidney extracts were obtained by homogenization of tissue in 3 Vol of extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5-6 mM mercaptoethanol) followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was dialyzed against TG-buffer (10 mM Tris-acetate-lo% glycerol-6 mM mercaptoethanol-1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), prior to ammonium sulfate fractionation: the fraction precipitating between 30 and 45% saturation (OC) was dissolved in and dialyzed against TG buffer. Affinity chromatography was performed on 8-(6'-aminohexylamino)-CAMP-Sepharose (aliquots corresponding to 50-250 g tissue and 3 ml matrix), similar to the procedure described for yeast extracts. SDS gel electrophoretic analysis Aliquots of fractions were either dialyzed against 0.1% SDS, freeze-dried, and the residues taken up in a small amount of sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) or trichloroacetic acid added to a final concentration of lo%, kept in ice for 2 hr, centrifuged for 30 min at - 1°C. the supernatant carefully removed, and the (mostly invisible) pellet washed with 5 ml water-free ether. The pellet was taken up in a small amount of sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 96°C. Polypeptides were electrophoretically separated in 15% SDS polyacrylamide gels. NDK activity was determined according to Agarwal et al. (1978), GAPDH according to Huitorel and Pantaboni (1985). Anti ~19 antiserum p19 as obtained by CAMP affinity chromatography was further purified by reversed phase HPLC (9OOpg p19 was mixed with 150~1 8 M urea, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1 Oh), applied to a C8-column (Whatman Protosil 300 Octyl 25) and eluted with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA. The fraction containing pure ~19 was used for immunization. Priming injection: 10 pg pl S/200 ~1 complete Freund's adjuvant (Difco) S.C. into guinea pigs; 2-4 booster injections with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The polyclonal antiserum thus obtained proved to be monospecific, except for the cross-reacting ~21, as shown by Western blots of cell homogenates.

Immunoquantitation of NDK Tissue homogenates were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (10% TCA, 90 min on ice), or cell cultures were treated in situ with the acid. Precipitates were washed twice with ether, dried, and dissolved in sample buffer. Aliquots (S ~1) containing 25 and 12.5 pg protein each were spotted on nitrocellulose membranes, vacuumdried (8O"C, 60 min), the membranes blocked with 3% BSA in TBS (50mM Tris-HCI pH 7.0-140 mM NaCl) for 30 min, incubated with anti p19 antiserum (1: lOOO-dilution in blocking buffer) for 18 hr at 4°C. After washing with TTBS (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 80), bound antibodies were detected with the aid of 12510dine-labeled protein A as described (Ludwig et al., 1988) (1O"cpm; 2 rig/ml; incubation for 2 hr, followed by washing and drying). Spots were counted and compared with a series of p19/p21 standards of increasing concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50 and 100 1.18 per 5 ,a Microsequencing of peptides Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), the polypeptide bands excised and analyzed in a sequenator (Applied Biosystems). Blocked polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose, the bands excised, treated with poiyvinyipyrrolidone (0.2%) to block nitrocellulose, and treated with trypsin or endoprotease Asp N. Trypsin (sequencing grade; Boehringer Mannheim) was applied in 50 ~1 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 8.2, with 5% acetonitrile for 18 hr at 37°C (1 pg trypsin for 40 c(g protein). Endoprotease Asp N (sequencing grade; Boehringer Mannheim) treatment was done in 50 ~1 0.05 M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 for 18 hr at 37°C (1 pg Asp N for 4Opg protein). After centrifugation, the released peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC, and subjected to microsequencing. Limited proteolysis of polypeptides was performed on excised gel sections by treatment with bromocyanide (50 mg/ml 0.1 M HCl) or chlorosuccinimide (50 mM in 1% SDS), and the reaction mixture was separated by SDS gel electrophoresis. The bands were then transferred to Immobilon membranes and sequenced. CAMP matrices 8-hydroxyethyl thio CAMP-Sepharose was either synthesized as described previously

RESULTS

AJim'ty chromatography of muscle extract (DEAE fraction) on CAMP matrices yields the regulatory subunits R of PKA and three additional polypeptides Regulatory subunits R of PKA bind CAMP with high affinity, and this property has been used to isolate R proteins by CAMP affinity chromatography from various sources (Ramseyer et al., 1974; Severin et al., 1974; Weber and Hilz, 1978). In these experiments, DEAE-cellulose chromatography of extracts usually preceded affinity chromatography in order to separate R, from R,, [DEAE peaks

I and II, respectively (Beavo et al., 1974)]. However, CAMP columns loaded with the DEAE peak I fraction from rabbit muscle retained R, and three additional proteins, even after washing with 2 M salt. Immunological tests showed that the additional proteins did not relate to the R subunits. These polypeptides could be sequentially desorbed ahead of the regulatory subunit (Fig. I). 1 mM AMP or 10 mM AMP (lanes 3 and 4) eluted large amounts of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 36 k (~36). The bulk of two smaller polypeptides (p 19/p2 1 doublet) was released when the matrix was washed with cold 30 mM CAMP (see Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8) although small amounts were also released by 10 mM AMP (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). Authentic p19/p21 was also slowly released from CAMP matrices by 10 mM AMP (not shown). Under these conditions R proteins remained bound. Only prolonged incubation (>2 hr) at 30" with

the two components. Indeed, high homology of the two polypeptides could be deduced from the observation that different monoclonal antibodies raised against a mixture of pl9 -t p2 1 cross-reacted with both antigens (cf. Fig. SB). Final proof for the close affiliation of these two polypeptides was obtained by microsequencing. Since both proteins were N-terminally blocked, the pl9/p21 fraction was separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, the bands excised and subjected to limited proteolysis by chemical (BrCN, chlorosuccinimide) or enzymic (trypsin, endoprotease AspN) treatments. Released peptides Zdentzjication of ~36 were separated by reverse phase HPLC, and several peptides were sequenced.

Furthermore, all pl9/p21 fractions exhibited high NDK activity (phosphorylation of dTDP to dTTP), and they cross-reacted with an antiserum raised against p19 (Fig. 5A). Our data are thus consistent with the interpretation that p19/p21 represent A and B subunits of NDK which were found to be highly homologous, exhibiting nearly identical weights (17,143 Da and 17,294 Da Fig. 2.

The extent of purification of these "CAMP-binding" polypeptides was considerable. Thus, a lOOO-fold purification of p19/p21 could be obtained by the affinity chromatographic step as evidenced by immunoquantitation (Table 1).

One step -procedure for the simultaneous isolation of GAPDH and NDK from various sources

The high selectivity of the CAMP affinity matrices lead us to test their usefulness for the isolation of the two enzymes in a one stepprocedure without preceding fractionation of

extracts. Tissue extracts were directly passed through a CAMP-Sepharose column, the matrix washed with buffer and 2 M NaCl, and then eluted with 2 mM AMP or 1 mM CAMP, and subsequently with 30 mM CAMP. Again, practically pure ~36 and pI9/p21 polypeptides, respectively, could be obtained (Fig. 6). This procedure has been applied successfully to the isolation of GAPDH and NDK from extracts of several cells, and several bovine tissues. However, while NDK recovery was consistently 85-95% independent of the source of the extracts, GAPDH was obtained in variable yield. It was nearly completely absorbed to

the CAMP matrix from tissue extracts such as bovine kidney or thyroid, or from solutions containing pure commercial enzyme (from rabbit muscle or yeast). In contrast, it was only partially absorbed when applied in cell extracts as obtained from A431 or yeast cultures. Thus, it appears that substances present in the cell extracts in high concentrations such as nucleotides and nucleic acids may prevent competitive interaction of the enzyme with the matrix. Indeed, when pure GAPDH was added to such extracts, binding of the extra amounts was also markedly reduced (~50%). Binding of the enzyme could be improved bg further dilution of extracts, or by treatment with nucleotideabsorbing charcoal.
DISCUSSION

In the course of CAMP affinity chromatography, originally devised for the isolation of PKA regulatory subunits (Ramseyer et al., 1974; Severin et al., 1974; Weber and Hilz, 1978), we observed additional polypeptides

(~36, pl9/p21) that were bound to immobilized CAMP. In this study we have identified the peptides by microsequencing and by their catalytic activities. p36 represents the subunit of the homopolymeric enzyme GAPDH, while p19/p21 appear to be subunits of the enzyme NDK. The identity of p19/p21 polypeptides with the A and B isoforms, respectively, of NDK is indicated by the high homology of partial sequences, the cross-reactivity of polyclonal and monoclonal anti p19 antibodies with ~21 (cf. Fig. 5), the formation of a catalytic intermediate (Fig. 4) and the close similarity of p19/p21 with the human NDK subunits in SDS gel electrophoretic analysis, exhibiting a striking difference in apparent molecular weight in spite of practically identical formular weights (Gilles et al., 1991; Rosengaard et al., 1989; Stahl et al., 1991). Mammalian NDK isoenzymes are hexamers composed of varying ratios of A and B subunits (Gilles et al., 1991). Extracts of different tissues bind with similar efficiency to immobilized CAMP in spite of different isoenzyme patterns. It is likely, therefore, that the various isoforms all exhibit affinity to CAMP and become isolated by the present procedure. It was a serendipitous finding that the two unrelated proteins, GAPDH and NDK, converge on their affinity to CAMP matrices. Interaction of both enzymes with the matrix appears to be specific for the nucleotide moiety: (i) Different spacer groups had no significant influence on binding properties as replacing the thio CAMP matrix with its long hydrophilic spacer by a matrix in which 8-(6'aminohexylamino) CAMP was directly coupled to agarose led to comparable yields. (ii) Resistence of the matrix-bound enzymes to 2 M NaCl-10% glycerol and their elution by CAMP also indicates binding to the cyclic nucleotide residues. Binding of GAPDH was weaker than that of NDK because 1 mM CAMP was able to elute the glycolytic enzyme but not the kinase. Furthermore, desorption of GAPDH was slightly faster with AMP than with CAMP suggesting that GAPDH recognizes the adenylate structure rather than the phosphodiester ring of the cyclic nucleotide. The fact that the enzyme was nevertheless retained by the immobilized CAMP indicated affinities in the lower range typical for substrates and inhibitors. Indeed, CAMP was shown to reduce GAPDH activity by interfering with NAD

binding (Jedziniak et al., 1985; DeMark et al., 1983) which suggests an interaction of the glycolytic enzyme with the CAMP matrix based on this property. The situation appeared to be different with NDK. Affinity of the kinase to immobilized CAMP was considerably higher than that of GAPDH, and it seemed to have a preference for the cyclic structure of the adenine nucleotide since bound enzyme was not released by 1 mM AMP. In view of the putative identity of NDK with the myc transcription factor PuF (Postel et al., 1993), and the known modulation of myc transcription by CAMP (Rock et al., 1992) we analyzed the effect of CAMP on NDK activity. Phosphorylation of TDP to TTP as well as formation of the catalytic intermediate (autophosphorylation) was inhibited by the cyclic nucleotide, but not, or only weakly, by AMP. However, inhibition was competitive, and affinity to the active site was about 10 times lower than that of ATP (Fig. 7). Although this would mean that CAMP concentrations required for NDK regulation are higher than cytosolic levels usually observed after stimulation with signal substances, sufficiently high local concentrations cannot be completely ruled out. In this context, it seems of interest to note that doublestranded purine nucleotides did not significantly affect NDK activity while poly(A) was able to increase TDP phosphorylation. Yet, the extent of NDK modulation is moderate ( -=z 2-fold) and requires concentrations > 0.5 mM polymeric "A". Since inhibition of activity by CAMP was not changed to a significant degree in the pres-

ence of poly(A), we feel that the affinity of NDK for CAMP is too low to account for a regulatory role in NDK activity. Despite these unresolved questions, the present procedure may provide a timeIy tool for the study of both multifunctional proteins, NDK and GAPDH, as it allows for a rapid isolation of the two enzymes from a large variety of cells and tissues.
SUMMARY

CAMP affinity chromatography previously used for the isolation of regulatory subunits of PKA yielded two additional proteins when applied to various mammalian tissue fractions. These proteins (36 k and a 19 k/21 k doublet in reducing SDS-PAGE) were not related to protein kinase subunits according to immunological criteria. They could be sequentially eluted from loaded affinity gels with CAMP solutions of increasing concentrations, ahead of the regulatory subunits. Microsequencing of p36 indicated identity with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) which was confirmed by the enzymic activity of the corresponding eluate. P19/p21 exhibited kinase activity (autophosphorylation). Partial amino acid sequence analysis and the respective catalytic activity established their identity with mammalian nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK) subunits. Recently, GAPDH was found to be involved in diverse non-glycolytic functions (DNA repair, export of nuclear RNA, protein phosphorylation, formation of triad junctions) while NDK has been implicated in tumor growth and metastasis, differentiation, and myc transcription. In view of the revived interest in these two apparently multifunctional enzymes, we present a one step-procedure for the simultaneous isolation of both proteins, which is based on the surprising property of these two unrelated polypeptides to bind to CAMP matrices with different affinity. The procedure is generally applicable to tissues and cell extracts.
