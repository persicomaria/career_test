Synthesis of FePP-MI (5). Reagents were purchased from TCI, Wako, Nacalai Tesque and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. 500 NMR spectrometer. (PerSeptive Biosystems).

H NMR spectra were recorded on a JEOL JNM-L IX monoethyl
[2-4]

MALDI spectra were recorded on a Voyager DE­PRO Protoporphyrin ester (6)[1] and were prepared by

N-(2-Aminoethyl)-maleimide Salt of Trifluoroacetic Acid (7) literature methods.

2,7,12,18-tetramethyl-3,8-divinyl-13-[2-(ethoxycarbonyl)-ethyl]-17-[2-{N-(2-ma leimidoethyl)-carbamoyl}ethyl]porphine (8): Compound 6 (0.03 g, 0.05 mmol) was dissolved in dry THF (20 mL). A mixture of compound 7 (0.017 g, 0.07 mmol) and dry triethylamine (10 L) in dry THF was the added to the solution. The dry triethylamine (15 L) was added and the solution was stirred at 0 °C for 10 min followed by addtion of diethylcyanophosphate (16 L, 0.11 mmol). The mixture was stirred under Ar at room temperature for 2.5 days. The solvent was removed and the solid was dissolved in CHCl3, washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3, and dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent removed. The crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluted with 1% MeOH ­CHCl3) to give 8 as a brown solid. 2

Crystallization, X-ray Data Collection and Crystallographic Refinement. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 45 K with a Rigaku JUPITER CCD (200 mm) using 1.0 Å synchrotron radiation at 44B2 (RIKEN beam line) of SPring-8. The data were integrated, merged and processed with HKL-2000. The crystal of FePP·4 belong to the space group R32, with unit cell dimensions a = 138.5, b = 138.5, c = 389.1 Å. The crystal parameters and data collection statistic are summarized in Table S1. The (gp27-gp5_S351L)3 structure (PDB code: 1WTH) was used as an initial model for the refinement of FePP·4. These refinements were carried out with a program REFMAC5[5] and CNS[6] and manual model building with a program COOT.[7] A statistically random selection of 5% of the total reflection data was excluded from the refinement and used to the calculate the free R factor (Rfree) as a monitor of model bias. After rigid-body refinement, FePP-MI were positioned manually on omit |FO| - |FC| map in the cavity. Several subsequent cycles of refinement brought the final R-factor and the Rfree to 24.3%, 31.5% at 3.1 Å resolution, respectively. The models were subjected to quality analysis during the various refinement stages with omit maps and PROCHECK.[8] The refinement statistics are summarized in Table S1. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes of 2Z6B for FePP·4.
