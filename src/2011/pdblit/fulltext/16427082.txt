The catabolite activator protein (CAP) sharply bends DNA in the CAPDNA complex, introducing a DNA kink, with a roll angle of $40  and a twist angle of $20  , between positions 6 and 7 of the DNA half-site, 5H -A1A2A3T4G5T6G7A8T9C10T11-3H (``primary kink''). CAP recognizes the base-pair immediately 5H to the primary-kink site, T:A6, through an ``indirect-readout'' mechanism involving sequence effects on the energetics of primary-kink formation. CAP recognizes the base-pair immediately 3H to the primary-kink site, G:C7, through a ``direct-readout'' mechanism involving formation of a hydrogen bond between Glu181 of CAP and G:C7. Here, we report that substitution of the carboxylate sidechain of Glu181 of CAP by the one-methylene-group-shorter carboxylate side-chain of Asp changes DNA binding speci®city at position 6 of the DNA half site, changing speci®city for T:A6 to speci®city for C:G6, and we report a crystallographic analysis de®ning the structural basis of the change in speci®city. The Glu181 3 Asp substitution eliminates the primary kink and thus eliminates indirect-readout-based speci®city for T:A6. The Glu181 3 Asp substitution does not eliminate hydrogen-bond formation with G:C7, and thus does not eliminate direct-readout-based speci®city for G:C7.

Introduction
Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) binds to DNA as a dimer of two identical subunits and makes 2-fold-symmetric interactions with a 22 bp 2-fold symmetric DNA site.1 ± 3 The consensus DNA half-site is 5H -A1A2A3T4G5T6H 4±6 G7A8T9C10T11-3 . CAP bends DNA sharply in the CAP-DNA complex.2,3,7 ± 9 CAP-induced DNA bending is highly localized to a ``primary kink'' between positions 6 and 7 of the DNA half-site. The primary kink exhibits a roll angle of $40  and a twist angle of $20  .1 ± 3 This compares to a roll angle of 1.5  and a twist angle of 36  for canonical B-form DNA.10

CAP recognizes the base-pair immediately 5H to the primary kink, base-pair 6, through an ``indirect-readout'' mechanism, involving sequence effects on the energetics susceptibility to DNA deformation (with the consensus base-pair, T:A, at position 6 requiring less free energy for primarykink formation than the non-consensus base-pairs, A:T, C:G, and G:C).6,11 CAP recognizes the basepair immediately 3H to the primary kink, base-pair 7, through a ``direct-readout'' mechanism, involving formation of a hydrogen bond between the carboxylate side-chain of Glu181 of CAP and the cytosine N4 atom of G:C base-pair 7.1 ± 3,12 ± 15 In the course of systematically constructing and analyzing amino acid substitutions of residue 181, we have found, unexpectedly, that substitution of the carboxylate side-chain of Glu181 by the onemethylene-group-shorter carboxylate side-chain of Asp results in a new DNA binding speci®city at position 6 of the DNA half-site. Thus, whereas

76 wild-type CAP prefers T:A at position 6, [Asp181]CAP prefers C:G at position 6 (Table 1). The change in speci®city is observed both in vitro and in vivo, and is large in magnitude (with speci®city for T:A of 1.3 kcal/mol (1 cal  4.184 J) per halfsite being changed to speci®city for C:G of >1.1 kcal/mol per half-site; Table 1C and D). The change in speci®city cannot be explained by possible elimination of interactions between residue 181 and G:C at position 7, since: (i) substitution of Glu181 by Ala (which eliminates interactions between residue 181 and G:C at position 73,15) does not change speci®city at position 6 (Table 1C and D); and (ii) substitution of Glu181 by Asp does not eliminate speci®city at position 7 (A.G. & R.H.E., unpublished results data). To de®ne the basis for the unexpected change in speci®city, we have carried out structural studies of [Asp181]CAP in complex with DNA.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination In the accompanying paper, we describe the determination of crystallographic structures of CAP in complex with 38 bp DNA fragments containing the consensus DNA site for CAP and a derivative of the consensus DNA site for CAP having a T:A 3 C:G substitution at position 6 of each DNA half-site (DNA fragments ICAP38 and [6C;17G]ICAP38; partial sequences in Table 1).11 In this work, we attempted to crystallize [Asp181]CAP in complex with the same two DNA fragments. No crystals were obtained with the DNA fragment containing the consensus DNA site (presumably due to the low af®nity of [Asp181]CAP for the consensus DNA site; Table 1); however, crystals were obtained with the DNA fragment containing the derivative of the consensus DNA site having a T:A 3 C:G substitution at position 6

of each DNA half-site. Crystals were obtained in space group P3121 (the same space group as in the accompanying work11). Diffraction data were collected using synchrotron radiation; the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of the CAP-DNA complex in space group Ê P3121 at 2.2 A resolution16 and the structure was Ê re®ned to 3.0 A resolution (Figure 1; Table 2). DNA-fragment ends in the structure were disordered; the present model contains the 26 central base-pairs. Overall structure The overall structure of the [Asp181]CAP-DNA complex is similar to, but not identical with, the structures of the CAP-DNA and CAP[6C;17G]DNA complexes (Figure 1).1 ± 3,11,16 Protein Ê atoms superimpose well (rmsd values of 0.82 A Ê and 0.75 A for superimposition of CAP atoms in [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA on CAP atoms in CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA). DNA atoms Ê superimpose less well (rmsd values of 2.1 A and Ê 2.9 A for superimposition of DNA atoms in [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA on DNA atoms in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA). In particular, DNA atoms for positions 4-6 of the DNA half-site Ê superimpose poorly (rmsd values of 3.4 A and Ê 4.7 A for superimposition of atoms of positions 4-6 of the DNA half-site in [Asp181]CAP[6C;17G]DNA on corresponding atoms in CAPDNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA). The overall DNA bend angle in the [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complex is similar to that in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes: 65  , versus 70  and 74  . Primary kink The most striking feature of the [Asp181]CAP[6C;17G]DNA complex is that it lacks the primary kink located between position 6 and 7 of the DNA half-site in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes (Figures 1-3).1 ± 3,11,16 In the [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complex, the DNA-helical parameters at positions 6 and 7 fall well within the range of DNA-helical parameters for non-kinked B-form DNA (red square in Figure 3(c)), with positions 6 and 7 exhibiting a roll angle of 12  and a twist angle of 36  (Figure 3(a) and (b)). This is in striking contrast to the situation in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes, in which positions 6 and 7 exhibit large roll deformation and

However, due to compensating changes in roll between positions 4 and 5 (À15  , versus 8  -22  for CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA; Figure 3(a); red circle in Figure 3(c)) and compensating changes in twist between positions 3 and 4 (20  , versus 33  35  for CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA; Figure 3(b); red triangle in Figure 3(c)), the remaining nucleotide pairs of the DNA half-site exhibit essentially the same conformation and positioning as in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes (Figure 1 and 2(d)), and the overall DNA bend angle is reduced only slightly relative to that in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes (Figure 1). Amino acid-base-pair contacts Patterns of hydrogen-bonded amino acid-basepair contacts in the [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complex are extremely similar to those in the CAP[6C;17G]DNA complex (Figures 2 and 4).11 Thus, in each complex, amino acid residue 180 forms hydrogen bonds with G:C at position 5, residue 181 forms hydrogen bonds with C:G at position 6 and G:C at position 7, and residue 185 forms hydrogen bonds with G:C at position 7 and A:T at position 8 (Figures 2(b) and (c), and 4(b) and (c)). The Od1 and Od2 atoms of the carboxylate sidechain of Asp181 form hydrogen bonds with the cytosine N4 atom of C:G at position 6 and the cytosine N4 atom of G:C at position 7, substituting, point-for-point, for the hydrogen bonds by the carboxylate side-chain of Glu181 (Figures 2(b) and (c), and 4(b) and (c)). The [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA and CAP[6C;17G]DNA complexes each contains an additional hydrogen bond, between residue 181

and C:G at position 6 (red in Figure 4(b) and (c)), that is absent from the CAP-DNA complex (Figure 4(a)). Implications In the CAP-DNA and the CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes, there is a dramatic DNA kink, with a roll angle of $40  , and a twist angle of $10  , between positions 6 and 7 of the DNA half-site (primary kink; Figures 2(a) and (b), and 3(a) and (b)).1 ± 3,11 The primary kink is responsible for the overwhelming majority of CAP-induced DNA bending in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes (Figure 1).1 ± 3,11 Our results indicate that in the [Asp181]CAP[6C;17G]DNA complex, the primary kink is absent (Figures 1, 2(c) and (d) and 3), with the primary-kink site exhibiting roll and twist angles that fall within the range observed for the nonkinked, B-form DNA (red square in Figure 3(c)). Nevertheless, the overall DNA trajectory and the overall DNA bend angle in the [Asp181]CAP[6C;17G]DNA complex are similar to those in the CAP-DNA and CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complexes (Figure 1), due to compensating changes in DNA-helical parameters elsewhere in the DNA site (Figure 3(a) and (b); red circle and red triangle in Figure 3(c)). The amino acid/basepair hydrogen-bonded interactions in the [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complex are similar to those in the CAP-DNA complex and essentially identical with those in the [6C;17G]DNA complex (Figure 4). The results de®ne the basis of the unexpected change in speci®city from T:A to C:G at position 6 upon substitution of Glu181 of CAP by Asp. With wild-type CAP, speci®city for T:A at position 6 is mediated through indirect-readout and is a consequence of primary-kink formation and sequence

DNA-binding experiments In vitro DNA-binding experiments were performed as described.6 (nitrocellulose ®lter-binding experiments, 1020 pM 32P-labeled DNA, 5-50,000 pM CAP or [Asp181]CAP (in >®vefold excess over the DNA concentration), 0.2 mM cAMP, 10 mM Mops-NaOH (pH 7.3), 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin; 23  C). In vivo DNA-binding experiments were performed as described.18 Crystallography Crystals were prepared as described11 and were ¯ashfrozen and mounted on loops at À165  C. Data were collected on the X25 beamline at the Brookhaven National Light Source, using a monochromatic X-ray source of Ê wavelength 1.1 A, and were processed using DENZO19 and SCALA20 (Table 2). For the [Asp181]CAP[6C;17G]DNA complex, the initial phasing model was derived from a previously reported structure of the CAP-DNA complex in space group P3121,16 omitting side-chain atoms beyond Cb for residue 181 of CAP and modeling DNA with the appropriate sequence. The initial R-factor was 41 %. The model was re®ned by CNS21 with anisotropic B-factor re®nement and bulksolvent correction. Manual ®tting was done using O.22 Omit maps were used to check electron density. Models were subjected to individual B-factor re®nement. Final structure-re®nement statistics are presented in Table 2. DNA helical parameters DNA-helical parameters were analyzed using 3DNA (kindly provided before publication by X. Lu and W. Olson). Overall DNA bend angles were obtained by measuring angles subtended by canonical B-form DNA helices superimposed on terminal segments of DNA molecules in complexes (superimposition using threebase-pair terminal segments).

effects on energetic susceptibilities to primarykink.11 With wild-type CAP, both DNA-sites that have T:A at position 6 and DNA sites that have C:G at position 6 undergo primary-kink formation (Figures 2(a) and (b), and 3),11 but DNA sites that have T:A at position 6 require less free energy for primary-kink formation than DNA sites that have C:G at position 6 (Figure 2).11 The energetic contribution of this indirect-readout effect is suf®ciently large that T:A is preferred over C:G by 1.3 kcal/ mol per half-site (Table 1c),6 despite the fact that CAP makes no hydrogen bonds with T:A at position 6, but does make a hydrogen bond with C:G at position 6 (Figures 2(c), and 4).11 With [Asp181]CAP, the primary kink is not formed (Figures 1-3) and, therefore, there is no indirect-readout-based preference for T:A at position 6. In the absence of an indirect-readout-based preference for T:A at position 6, the full energetic contribution of the hydrogen bond with C:G at position 6 becomes manifest, and C:G becomes the preferred base-pair at position 6. The current results, at the current resolution, do not de®ne the structural basis for the difference in primary-kink formation by wild-type CAP and [Asp181]CAP. In principle, the difference in primary-kink formation by wild-type CAP and [Asp181]CAP could involve differences in positive components (i.e. energetically favorable interactions by the Glu181 and Asp181 side-chains), differences in negative components (i.e. energetically unfavorable interactions by the Glu181 and Asp181 side-chains), or both. The observation that the complex of wild-type CAP with the DNA fragment having C:G at position 6 yields a primary kink, whereas the complex of [Asp181]CAP with the same DNA fragment does not, clearly illustrates that protein-DNA interactions, not DNA sequence, de®ne DNA conformation in the complex, with the protein in essence ``bending DNA to its will'' (see also the accompanying paper11). Furthermore, the observation that the overall DNA bend angle is similar in the CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complex, which has the primary-kink, and in the [Asp181]CAP-[6C;17G]DNA complex, which does not, clearly illustrates that in protein-DNA complexes, a given overall DNA bend angle can be achieved through very different local DNA-helical parameters.
