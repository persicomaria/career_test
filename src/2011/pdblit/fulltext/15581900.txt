Horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase was crystallized at pH 7 and 5°C from an equilibrium mixture containing predominantly NAD + and p-bromobenzyl alcohol and lower concentrations of NADH and p-bromobenzaldehyde. It is assumed from the results of kinetic studies in solution that most of the enzyme was complexed with NAD+ and p-bromobenzyl alcohol. A ternary complex with NAD+ and trifluoroethanol (an unreactive alcohol) and complexes wit,h NAD + or NADH and 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (the crystallization agent, which partially occupies the substrate-binding pocket) were also crystallized. All of these complexes formed triclinic crystals t'hat were isomorphous with the enzyme+NADH-dimethylsulfoxide complex, which has been solved to a resolution of 4.5 A. X-ray diffractometer data (at 4.5 A) were used to compute electron density difference maps, which showed that both subunits of the dimeric enzyme bound pu-bromobenzyl alcohol or trifluoroethanol in a substrate binding pocket. that was close to the position occupied by dimothylsulfoxide. These complexes appeared to have the same protein and coenzyme structure as the complex wit11 NADH and dimethylsulfoxide. Since the dimethylsulfoxide appeared to bc ligated to the catalytic zinc atom, it was not possible to see a direct connect,ion between the alcohols and the zinc ion in these difference maps. However, maps computed from the differences in amplitudes between the NAD+--alcohol conplexes and NAD(H)-methylpentanediol complexes and the phases from the NADH-dimethylsulfoxide complex showed continuous electron density from the bromo or trifluoromethyl positions of the substrates to the zinc ion. Using the structure of the orthorhombic form of apoenzyme, which has been solved to a the various maps, we constructed a resolution of 2.4 A, as a guide for interpreting provisional model of the active site. This model led us to conclude that the oxygen of either alcohol is directly ligated to the zinc ion (2 A), while carbon 1 of the alcohol is 3.5 k from carbon 4 of the nicotinamide ring. Studies at higher resolution are required to confirm these conclusions and to reveal further details.

1. Introduction
The structure of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase complexed with NADH and the inhibitory substrate analog dimethylsulfoxide has been determined to a resolution of 4.5 A (Eklund Q BrLndBn, unpublished work). This ternary complex crystallizes in the triclinic space group, with one molecule of the dimeric enzyme per asymmetric

In order to define t,he substrate site in greater detail, we crvst'allized complexes of the enzyme with coenzyme and an active substrate, (p-bromobenzyl alcohol) or with NAD+ and a,n inert alcohol (trifluoroetha,nol) and investigated their structures at a resolution of 4.5 A. Enzymologists have long sought to determine the detailed structures of enzymcsubstrate complexes. X-rap crystallograp~iy has provided much of the desired information about the st,ructures of the proteins, but specific structural information about the binding of substrates has been more difficult to obtain. For t'he hydrolytic enzymes in particular, kinetics and thermodyna,mics of reaction strongly favor conversion of substrates to products before the data can be collected. Nevertheless. special techniques have been applied wiDh some success. Complexes with very poor substrates (Hartsuck & Lipscomb. 1971; Henderson, 1970; Riihlman ef al., 1973; (Steitz et al., 1969; Arnone Kester & Matthews, 1977). products or "virt,ual"substrat'es et al., 1971). isosteric and inactive sub&ate analogs (Richards & Wyckoff. 1971), and transition state analogs (Ford et al.. 1974) have been studied. Recently, low temperature methods (Alber ef al., 1976) have also been employed. For dehydrogenases (and many other enzymes). it is possible to form central complexes containing all of bhe substrates (or products) under equilibrium conditions. At pH values near neut'rality, an enzyme may be saturat,ed with reasonable concentrations of substrates, as is achieved in isotope exchange reactions (Silverstein & Boyer, 1964). It' should be not'ed that even though some substrate will be converted to product, the enzyme will be saturated if the equilibrium concentrations of one set of substrates greatly exceed the Michaelis and inhibition constants for the concentrations of substrates and products should those substrates. Theoretica,lly. be high enough that t,he ratio of mzyme in cent'ral complexes to total enzyme approaches unity. but the relevant, kinetic equations arc quite complicated (Cleland, 1963). In practice. one should at' least use concentratiorls of substrates that exceed the kinetic constants in the relevant, equations by a factor of 10. For alcohol dehydrogenase, the equilibrium position at pH 7 greatly favors NAD + and alcohol: K,, = [NADH]laldehydel/[ NAD][a,lcoholJ is 9.7 x 1O-5 M for ethanol (Backlin, 1958) or 2.3,~ 10P4 to 5.0% 10m4 ~1 for benzyl alcohol (Klinman. 1972: Bernhard et al.. 1970: Luisi & Bignetti. 1974). Thus, if substrates are present in excess, tjhe saturation of the enzyme may hc estimated with reference only to the concentrations of free NAD+ and alcohol.

Thus, the enzyme-NAD+-benzyl alcohol species should predominate by a factor of about 28 to 1. Similar studies have not been performed w&h bromobenzyl alcohol. but based on studies of the effects of'pg"-subst)itution on the rates of hydrogen transfer (Dworschack & Plapp, 1977). UX' expect that subst,itution with the electron-withdrawing p-bromo group would shift' the equilibrium more toward the alcohol.

340 nm of the out,er dialysate had decreased t,o a steady-state level that would correspond to a concentration of NADH of about 26 PM. During the following lo-week crystallization. the A,,, and A,,, values did not change significantly. Crystallization occurred at, 12 to 15% MPD and was continued until the concentration of MPD was 25 to 30%. From the A 340 value, we calculated t,hat the concentrations of NAD+ and BrPhCH,OH were each about O-5 InM and that BrPhCHO remained at a concentration of about 0.37 I~IM. Sincr these concentrations are about IO times larger than the kinetic constants published for NAD' and benzyl alcohol at pH 7 and 25°C (Dalziel, 1963; Dworschack & Plapp, 19773, we assumed that the enzyme would be 90% saturated with NAD+ and BrPhCH,OH. Good quality crystals were also prepared under the conditions described above, except tllat F,CCH,OH or BrPhCHO was omitted. Crystallization began at about 15% MPD, and the solution was finally made 30% in MPD. Starting w&h 0.65 mM-NAD + as the coenzyme, the absorbances at 260, 280 and 340 mn of outer dialysate indicated that there were onl\ negligible changes in the actual concentration of NAD+. However, starting with 0.65 m&r-NADH, the absorbance at 340 run showed that no more than 0.11 rnx-NADH was left after 10 weeks. Increased absorbance at 290 nm suggested that the NADH had been hydrated (Stock et al., 1961). Th erefore, 1 week before X-ray diffraction measurements was replaced with fresh 0.65 mM-NADH and 30% MPD in were made, the outer dialysate 0.05 M-TES-NH, buffer (pH 7-O). As a precaution, the dialysate with NAD+ was also replaced. Both triclinic and P2, monoclinic crystals were obtained in a single bag from these crystallizations. (b) X-ray analyses X-ray intensities were collected on a Philips-Stoe 4 circle diffractometer and corrected for absorption, Lorentz and polarization effects, and time-dependent intensity decrease as described previously (Eklund et al., 1976). Scale factors and (minor) corrections for anisotropic intensity decrease due to crystal disorder were computed for each crystal by comparison with the data for the enzyme--NADH-dimethylsulfoxide complex (Eklund & BriindBn, unpublished work). Two different crystals of each ternary complex were used to reflections used to compute maps at a resolution of 4.5 A. collect the 4343 independent One crystal of the binary enzyme-NADH complex was used to collect 2439 reflections, and one crystal of the binary enzyme-NAD + complex was used for an additional 1769 reflections in order to obtain the 3836 reflections used to compute maps based on a partial 4.5 A data set'. The electron density through the molecule was sampled in sections perpendicular to the molecular a-fold axis. The orientation of this axis was obtained from the rotation function (Eklund & BriindBn, unpublished work). These sections correspond to the xz planes of the orthorhombic crystals, since the molecular 2-fold axis is parallel to the crystallographic y axis in that structure. Details of the low-resolution triclinic map could in terms of the high-resolution orthorhombic structure by thus easily be interpreted comparing equivalent sections of the 2 electron density maps. Furthermore, the orthorhombic co-ordinate system could easily be transferred into the triclinic maps by using the positions of the 2 catalytic zinc atoms of the molecule to define directions corresponding z and z axes. The atomic co-ordinates given in Table 1 are thus to the orthorhombic directly comparable to the atomic co-ordinates of t,he orthorhombic structure (Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laborat)ory, Upton, N.Y. 11973, U.S.A.).

3. Results
The electron density map computed for the E-NADH-BrPhCH,OH complex (using isomorphous phases from the E-NADH-Me,SO structure) was very similar to that computed for the E-NADH-Me&30 complex, except that there was an additional peak in the area identified as the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 1). A difference map between these complexes shows positive density in the same location, corresponding to the electron dense bromophenyl group, and negative density just under the zinc ion, corresponding to the Me&JO. No other significant differences were noted in the densities corresponding to the protein or coenzyme.

The solid scale computed using amplilines represent contours at levels of 600, 900, 1200 . . , on a relative tudes for E-NAD +-BrPhCH,OH and isomorphous phases from E-NADH-Me,SO. The difference map was computed with the amplitudes calculated by 113' E-NAD+-BrPhCH,OHI - 13' ENADH-Me,SOI 1 and phases for E-NADH-Me,SO. The broken lines and cross-hatched areas represent positive density and the dotted lines and minus signs represent negative density conscale. The scale of the map is 0.16 cm/f%. The toured at levels of 200, 400. . . , on the same density map shows portions of both subunits of the molecule, which are related by the molecular e-fold axis indicated by the large plus sign. Positions of cc-carbon atoms are tentatively identified for subunit 2 in the upper right part of the map. Nit Rib ident,ifies the nicotinamide ribose and PP the pyrophosphate of the coenzyme. The catalytic zinc ion is under Cys46.

Integration of the densities in the substrate binding pockets showed that both sites were approximately equally occupied. Rotation of sections by 180" around the molecular 2-fold axis and consequent superposition of one site onto the other show small differences (up to 1.5 8) in locations of peak densities corresponding to the BrPhCH,OH, the nicotinamide ring and some protein regions. However, these differences cannot be regarded as significant until they are confirmed by studies at higher resolution. It may be concluded that both sites bind bromobenzyl alcohol OI dimethylsulfoxide in about the same manner. Although density for the bromophenyl group appears in these maps (Fig. l), density for the hydroxymethyl group is weak or absent. The simplest explanation for the lack of density is that the hydroxymethyl group partially overlaps the positions of the sulfur and oxygen atoms of Me&O. If the positions overlapped completely, the net effect on the difference electron density would be a negative peak near the position of the sulfur atom. If the positions were slightly different, so that only partial overlap occurred between the densities, the negative peak would be deeper and its position would be shifted away in a direction opposite that of the hydroxymethyl group. The positive density corresponding t'o the hydroxymethyl group would not be visible, since it would be canceled by the negative density in the region around the sulfur atom. In order to determine where the hydroxymethyl group may be located, we attempted to prepare crystals of a binary enzyme-coenzyme complex, without a ligand in the substrate binding pocket. However, difference maps computed for E-NAD(H) against E-NADH-Me,SO showed positive and negative densities in

As a secondary alcohol, either stereoisomer of MPD should bc a suhst,rate (Dickinson & Dalziel, 1967). Indeed, at, pH 8 and 25°C. MPD has a K, value of about 0.7 nr (with a saturating concentration of NAD + of 1 mnf) and a I-,,,,, vdur 155",,, that, of ethanol. and at pH 7 and 25°C it, was a competitive inhibit,or against, ethanol wit,h a, constant of about 0.9 M (D. P. Bohlken. unpublished result's). Thus it, would be reasonable to assume that an enzyme-coenzyme-substrate complex \\,ould form with about, 7Oq;, occupancy when the MPD concentration was SO'!,,. or I.5 BZ. Enzyme and NADH might also form an abortive complex with MPD. as has been shown for primary and secondary alcohols (Dalzicl & Dickinson. 1966).

In order to interpret the various electron den&y maps in terms of the structure of the enzyme, a model on a scale of 2 cm per A was built into a map of the protein and coenzyme density, such as that in Figure 1, using an optical comparator. The several difference maps were also viewed in the comparat,or and the locations for BrPhCH,OH and F,CCH,OH were chosen to be consistent with all of them. Although BrPhCH,OH and FsCCH20H contain electron dense atoms, or groups of atoms, the peak densities did not correspond exactly to the positions chosen in the model building. This is due to the fact that calculation of overlapping positive and negative peaks in a difference map tends to shift an observed peak density away from the boundary between the peaks. From examination of our various difference maps, the ext'ent of shifting was as much as 1 A. Moreover. although the trifluoromethyl and bromo groups are the most electron dense groups in their respective molecules, at a resolution of 4.5 A they cannot be resolved from the rest of their molecules. A stereo diagram of a portion of the model is shown in Figure 4. Co-ordinates for substrat,es and substrate analogs are listed in Table 1. Co-ordinates of most of the amino acid residues around the substrates in the triclinic conformation were quite similar to the co-ordinates for the orthorhombic conformation.

4. Discussion
Although the model (Fig. 4) is provisional, several important features may be noted. The oxygen of either alcohol is directly ligated to the catalytic zinc (2 A bond distance), and carbon 1 of the alcohol is 3.5 A from carbon 4 of the nicotinamide ring,

with the reactive C-H bond almost perpendicular to the plane of the nicotinamide ring. Thus the substrates are positioned ideally for a direct transfer of hydrogen between them. The benzene ring comes within van der Waals' contact (3.5 A) of the nicotinamide ring. F,CCH,OH occupies essentially the same positions as the first three homologous atoms in BrPhCH,OH. The position of the alcohol oxygens is close to the place where a water molecule is ligated to the zinc in the npoenzyme and is inbetween the positions for the two nitrogens of bound l,lO-phenanthroline (Boiwe & BrSindBn, 1977). The oxygen of Me,SO is also ligated to the zinc. It appears from these results, therefore, that the conclusion of Sloan et al. (1975) that the alcohol oxygen is not ligated to the zinc, but instead binds to the water bound to zinc, is not correct. To determine whether or not the water molecule is present or displaced, that is. whether the zinc is tetraco-ordinate (BrSindBn et al., 1975) or pentaco-ordinate (Dworschack & Plapp, 1977) in the central complex requires studies at higher resolution. The binding sites for BrPhCH,OH and F,CCH,OH are at the bottom of the channel proposed to be the substrate binding pocket (Eklund et aZ., 1976). This pocket is highly hydrophobic and could accommodate even larger substrates. In fact, the enzyme does react with a variety of stereoisomeric ketones and secondary alcohols. However, the enzyme does not exhibit absolute stereospecificity (Prelog, 1964; Dickinson & Dalziel, 1967; Irwin & Jones, 1976; Dutler, 1977). It appears that hydrophobic interactions, the zinc-oxygen bond, and the geometry of hydrogen transfer determine that the pro-R hydrogen of ethanol would be preferentially removed. The fact that both subunits can bind substrate (Fig. 1) is significant for various considerations of the mechanism of catalysis. It has been proposed that the enzyme has "half-of-the-sites" reactivity (Bernhard et al., 1970; Luisi & Bignetti, 1974), but the observations are disputed (Hadorn et al., 1975; Weidig et al., 1977). If the enzyme mechanisms in which only one subunit of the dimer can bind has such reactivity, alcohol or aldehyde at a time seem to be eliminated by the crystallographic results. At

These co-ordinates were measured from models built into electron density maps of the triclinic structure and transformed into t,he same co-ordinate system used to describe the orthorhombic structure.

the present stage of our work, we cannot determine whether one subunit contained NADH-bromobenzaldehyde and the other subunit contained NAD +-bromobenzyl alcohol or if there are small differences in the structures of the two active sites. Since only saturating concentrations of substrates were used, we also cannot exclude the possibility that the subunits might have different affinities for substrates. It appears that we have been able to crystallize alcohol dehydrogenase complexed with substrates, and we would recommend this approach with other enzymes. Crystallography of enzymes complexed with good substrates can have the advantage that a productive complex is being studied. A productive complex should have the substrates suitably oriented for the chemical reaction. Poor substrates or inhibitors

can bind in non-product ivr modw. A possible tiisadvantagc is ttlilt thtb cyuilil)riunr between suhstrat'es and products on the surface of t,hck csnzyme wultl 1~ near unity. This could lead to difficulties in locating the atoms in the substrate at high ryw)lution. For instance. in the conversion of an alcohol t'o an aldellgde, t hwr could tw large movements of suhstituents on carbon I (Klinman. 1976). Nwt~rthelcss. if ow WI, determine from studies in solution or. bct'trbr, from spectroscopic examination of the crystals themselves, that, one form of complex predominates. it is likely that, thtl electron density maps can be correct,ly interprebed.
