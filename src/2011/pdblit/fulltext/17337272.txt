Received 22 October 1984 Reduction of cytochrome b-560 (analogous to cyt b-562 of mitochondria) via an antimycin-sensitive route has been revealed in chromatophores of the photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodqpseudomonas sphaeroides Ga. Indeed, the results suggest that two reductive mechanisms can be operative. One is consistent with the idea that the quinol generated at the reaction center Q,site enters the Q pool and, via the Q,site, equilibrates with cytochrome b-560. The other reductive mode circumvents redox equilibrium with the pool; we consider that this could result from a direct encounter of the reaction center with the bc, complex perhaps involving a direct Qe-Qc site interaction. This latter reaction is suppressed by occupancy of the Qc site, not only by antimycin but by ubiquinol and ubiquinone.

1. INTRODUCTION
In his Q-cycle model for the operation of ubiquinol-cytochrome cz oxidoreductase (bci complex), Mitchell [1,2] proposed that there are two quinol/quinone sites on the protein that catalyze redox reactions between the two-electron quinone pool sequestered in the membrane and the oneelectron b-cytochromes in the protein. The sites * Present address: BCP Jansen Institute, Laboratory of Biochemistry, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

were designated Qin and Qout according to their postulated relative locations on the protein with respect to the membrane surfaces. Experimental evidence supports the existence of two distinct catalytic sites for quinol/quinone on the bcl complex of mitochondrial and photosynthetic systems (review, [3]). One site is recognized as catalyzing cyt b reduction concurrent with (via Rieske FeS) cyt cl + cz reduction [4-121. In this mechanism it is thought that a quinol occupying the site is oxidized by the Rieske FeS center [lo, 1I] to a semiquinone which is able to reduce cyt b. The antibiotic myxothiazol displays a high affinity for this site and strongly inhibits its reaction [14-181. The site has been called QZ [19-231 and has the characteristics expected of Mitchell's Qout site. The existence of another quinone binding site associated with the bci complex has been revealed as the EPR signal of a stable semiquinone [24-261. This species is commonly called QE and with the arguments below can be circumstantially identified

as Qin. The EPR signal of the semiquinone is specifically abolished by the antibiotic antimycin [24-261. The working proposal that the effect of antimycin represents an inactivation of the QE site and that Qf can serve as an oxidant of cyt b [24-261 rationalizes the well-known inhibition by antimycin of cyt b oxidation [f&27,28]. The proposal can also explain the demonstration of cyt b reduction that does not involve the myxothiazolsensitive, Q,-mediated mechanism [ 14- 181. This mode of cyt b reduction is antimycin-sensitive and thus displays this antibiotic in the less familiar role as an inhibitor of the reduction of cyt b; it also implicates Qc, under these conditions, as the reductant of cyt b. These reactions involving the QZ and QE sites have also been clearly demonstrated in a lightactivatable hybrid system comprising photochemical reaction centers from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides R26, bcl complex from beef heart and horse heart cyt c [29,30]. Single-turnover flash activation promotes both the myxothiazol-sensitive (Q,-mediated) and the antimycin-sensitive (Qcmediated) routes to cyt 6. However, in the native photosynthetic bacterial chromatophore membrane, while the Q,-mediated route is evident, the Q,-mediated, antimycin-sensitive route to cyt b reduction has not been observed. The work presented here demonstrates the antimycin-sensitive Q,-mediated route to cyt b reduction in chromatophores of Rps. sphaeroides. Two reductive mechanisms are revealed. One involves redox equilibrium of cyt b with the quinone pool. The other may involve a direct interaction of the reaction center and bcl complex. Physiological considerations are discussed.

determined as in [34]. Treatment of submitochondrial particles and chromatophores with organic solvents is an effective way to remove selectively ubiquinone without disrupting electron transfer pathways. Isooctane extraction lowers the content of functional bcl complex and reaction center by less than 10%. The functional cyt c2 content, however, may be diminished by as much as 40-50% after two to three cycles of extraction. In this work a single cycle of extraction was sufficient to lower quinone content by 85-95% while retaining 80% of the original cyt c2. Myxothiazol was a generous gift of Dr W. Trowitzsch, Gesellschaft fur Biotechnologische Forschung, FRG. All solvents used for quinone extraction and determination were HPLC grade. 3. RESULTS Cyt b reduction via the antimycin sensitive route has not been observed in chromatophores, possibly due to a thermodynamically unfavorable path from the Q pool (Em7 = 90 mV; &,/pH = - 60 mV/pH unit [34]) to cyt b-560 (see later; Em7 = 50 mV; p&d = 7.5 [36]) at pH 7.0. Strategies may be devised, however, which alter the operating potential of the Q pool or which exploit differential &/pH relationships and render the route more favorable. For example, a natural suppression of the route may relate simply to the Q pool's redox buffering capacity. The redox potential of the pool according to the Nernst equation is governed by the [Qp]/[QpHz] ratio. Thus, the effect of decreasing [Q,,] by extraction while maintaining the QH2 supply constant is to lower the effective redox potential of the pool. Alternatively, raising the ambient pH increases the midpoint potential difference (A&) between Qp and cyt b-560. At pH values of 6,7, 8,9 and 10, for example, the difference in E, values is + 40, + 40, + 10, - 50 and - 110 mV, respectively. Each of these protocols was used in an attempt to observe cyt b reduction in myxothiazol treated chromatophores. Fig.1 shows kinetics of flash-induced cyt b reduction in lyophilized (traces a-d) and in lyophilized and solvent extracted (traces e-h) chromatophores poised at pH 7.0 and an & sufficient to render the quinone pool completely oxidized prior to activation.

Fig. 1. Flash-activated cyt b reduction kinetics in lyophilized (a-d) and quinone-extracted (e-h) chromatophores. Chromatophores were lyophilized and extracted as outlined in section 2 and were suspended to final reaction center concentrations of 0.14 pM (left column) or 0.16 PM (right column) in 20 mM Mops, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2; pH 7.0. Valinomycin (1 PM) and CCCP (0.2 PM) were added in addition to the redox mediators 2,3,4,5tetramethylphenylenediamine (2.5 pM), phenazine methosulfate (1 PM) and phenazine ethosulfate (1 PM). The ambient redox potential was adjusted to 230 f 10 mV. Myxothiazol and antimycin were each added where indicated to 5 pM and 10 pM, respectively. The optical change of cyt b was measured as the difference between 561 and 540 nm.

strate the familiar stimulation of cyt b reduction by antimycin in chromatophores containing a full complement of quinone (41 per reaction center). In

the presence of myxothiazol, however, no cyt b is reduced (trace c), independent of the presence of antimycin (trace d) indicating that all cyt b reduction occurs by the Q,-mediated route. In contrast, extracted chromatophores, in which there were 7

quinones per reaction center, display strikingly different patterns of cyt b reduction. These chromatophores exhibit, in the presence of myxothiazol, a significant amount of cyt b reduction after the flash (trace g; cf. trace c). This reduction is independent of the presence of redox-mediating dyes (not shown), and as trace h demonstrates, it is inhibited by antimycin.

Conditions for kinetic traces were the same as those in fig.1 with the following exceptions: Mops was substituted by Tricine (pH 8.5) or glycine (pH 9.8). Experiments were performed at 240 + 10 mV at pH 7.0, 190 + 10 mV at pH 8.5 and 160 + 10 mV at pH 9.8. Each experimental point (O---O) in panels B-D was calculated from the absorbance difference at the wavelength pair 561-540 nm, 50 ms following delivery of a single flash. A myxothiazol plus antimycin control trace was subtracted at each quinone concentration. Simulations of quinone pool-cyt b-560 redox equilibria (B-D) were performed by calculating the Eh of a variable pool (&7, E,s 5, E,9 = 90, 0, - 78 mV, respectively) with one reduced quinone and by assuming contact with either the low potential or the high potential cyt b-560 (E,,,7, E~3.5, Em98 = cyt b-560 (Em7, Em8.5, E,,,s 8 = 50, 20, 20 mV, respectively; ---) 155, 120, 120 mV, respectively; se.).

Fig.2A shows the effect of pH on the extent of antimycin-sensitive cyt b reduction. As predicted, this route to cyt b emerges as the pH of the chromatophore suspension is raised. At pH 8.5 and 9.8 even unextracted chromatophores display some antimycin-sensitive cyt b reduction. Also, as expected with quinone-extracted chromatophores, the route is revealed at lower pH values; for example, fig.2A shows that with 3 quinones per reaction center, cyt b reduction is nearly maximal between pH 7.0 and 8.5. Fig.2B-D shows these results in detail, presenting the yield of antimycin-sensitive cyt I, reduction as a function of the size of the quinone pool at 3 pH values. The data are compared to theoretical lines which assume a simple redox equilibrium between the ubiquinone pool and either the low potential cyt b-560 or the high potential cyt b-560 (Em7 = 155 mV [36]; p&d = 7.5 [37]) detectable in dark titrations of chromatophores. Neither of the theoretical treatments conforms to the experimental data with the exception of low potential cyt b-560 reduction at maximum values of quinone content. These results are not due to any artifact of the quinone extraction procedure since reconstitu-

tion of the full quinone complement restores cyt b reduction behavior typical of unextracted chromatophores. Fig.3 shows, under optimized conditions of high pH and low quinone pool size, kinetics (A) and spectra (B and C) of the events that accompany cyt b reduction via either the myxothiazol-sensitive or the antimycin-sensitive route. Fig.3A demonstrates that in the presence of myxothiazol, cyt b reduction occurs on a time scale that is independent of that of the redox reactions of cyt cr + CZ. In contrast, in the presence of antimycin, myxothiazol-sensitive cyt b reduction occurs concomitant with the partial reduction of cyt cl + ~2, consistent with expectations concerning the Q,-mediated route to cyt b [8,38]. In fig.3B are spectra obtained from experimental traces at various wavelengths, each relative to 540 nm. Fig.3C is composed of two resolved spectra which correspond to the routes to cyt b reduction. The top spectrum shows absorbance changes when cyt b reduction proceeds via the antimycinsensitive route and confirms that cyt b is reduced with no significant accompanying cyt c reduction. The bottom spectrum shows the absorbance

For simulation, I?,,, QBH~/Q~- = - 150 mV; E,,, Q pool at pH 7, 8.5, 9.8 = 90, 0, - 78 mV, respectively; Em cyt b-560 at pH 7, 8.5, 9.8 = 40, 20, 20 mV, respectively. A Kd of the Qc site for Q of 0.45 PM provided the best fit to the experimental data. It was assumed that the Qa-cyt b-560 mode proceeds only in the absence of a site occupant.

[29] and is again shown in fig.4 for comparison with the antimycin-sensitive route. The failure of myxothiazol-sensitive cyt b-560 reduction as the redox potential is lowered follows the familiar course of the n = 1 Nernst curve of cyt b-560 (Ems = 20 mV); the failure in this case results simply from the fact that the cytochrome is already reduced prior to activation. In contrast, the failure of cyt b reduction via the antimycin-sensitive route describes an n = 2 curve with an Em9 value of 62 mV.

4. DISCUSSION Cyt b-560 is reduced in flash-activated chromatophores via two independent routes distinguished by their sensitivities to either antimycin or myxothiazol and defined by their characteristic difference spectra. The familiar myxothiazol-sensitive pathway is part of an oxidant-induced reduction sequence involving electron transfer by QZ to both the high and low potential ends of the bcr complex. The other, described here in detail, is an antimycin-sensitive route presumably involving the Qc site. This route may be revealed by increasing the redox potential difference between the Q pool and cyt b-560. However, a simple thermodynamic contact between these components is insufficient to describe the higher than predicted levels of cyt b reduction observed after quinone extraction. To explain these results, we propose that antimycin-sensitive cyt b reduction may proceed by two discrete, simultaneously operating mechanisms; one, dominant at high [Qp] and directly QP mediated (Qp-cyt b-560), the other dependent upon circumvention of QP and upon QB as the ultimate reductant (QB-cyt b-560). The Qp-cyt b-560 operates by exchange of reducing mode equivalents between the Q pool and cyt b-560, presumably involves the Qc site and relies for effective electron transfer on the redox potential of QP. The QB-~yt b-560 mode is expressed in inverse proportion to the size of QP, requires an unoccupied Qc site and implies collision and complex formation between the reaction center (RC) and the bcl complex. There are a number of assumptions implicit in the idea of the Qn-cyt b-560 mechanism: (1) The reducing power of Qn is translated directly to 348

cyt b-560 without loss due to interaction with Qp; (2) a quinol at the QB site is the reductant of cyt b-560. This is based on the observation of binary oscillations of antimycin-sensitive cyt b reduction in a dark-adapted hybrid system (unpublished); (3) the operating E,,, of QnHz/Qe- is approx. - 150 mV. This value is derived from the operating Em of QA/QA- [39] and the potential difference calculated from the equilibrium constant for electron exchange between QA and QB [40]; (4) cyt b-560 reduction by this mode will not proceed if the Qc site is occupied (i.e., by antimycin, Q, Q'-, or QH2); (5) normally, [QP] is higher than the Kd of Qc for quinone. Extraction brings [QP] within the range of Kd and, in an oxidized pool, leaves Qc sites unoccupied for time periods which permit productive RC/bci interactions; (6) the Kd for quinol is lOO-fold lower than that of quinone [26]. Prereduction of a single free quinone per bcl complex is therefore sufficient to populate Qc sites and to block cyt b reduction at any [QP]. A simulation based on these assumptions and compared to experimental data is shown in fig.5. In each panel the dotted line describes concerted cyt b reduction by the two postulated mechanisms based on a Kd for Q binding to Qc of 0.45 PM. Kd was derived from redox component concentrations and by assuming that any bcl complex exhibiting cyt b reduction above that expected from a pure Qp-cyt b-560 mechanism lacked an occupied Qc site. The lower, dashed line in each panel is an isolated view of the Qp-cyt b-560 reduction mode. Other mechanistic treatments fail to provide the combination of a strong reductant and a reliance on [QP] and therefore a less reasonable fit to the experimental data. Antimycin-sensitive cyt b reduction failing at an & of 88 mV has been noted in the RC/bcl hybrid system in the absence of cyt c [29]. A non-Q pool mechanism involving Qn and a special quinone comparable to Qc was postulated to explain the data. Authors in [30] have also alluded to Qn as a possible reductant of cyt b-560 in the hybrid system. Q pool dependent and independent modes of inter-complex electron transfer have been postulated to explain the onset and resolution of anomalous kinetics and inhibitor sensitivities after removal and subsequent reconstitution of quinone in mixtures of complex I and III [41,42].

sensitive cyt b reduction provides some insight into the proposed mechanisms. The idea that occupancy of the Qc site prevents QB interaction with cyt b-560 is easily fitted into a mechanism which fails at redox potentials higher than the Em of cyt b-560. The E,,, of failure would correspond well to the half-maximal [QHz] at Qf (see fig.4 and [26]). Qp-cyt b-560 may fail for the same reason if a ligand at Qc insulates cyt b-560 from Qp. The physiological implication of a route to cyt b suppressed by [Qp] is that the size of QP and the properties of Qc combine to bias the direction of bcr complex electron flow. As such, Qc may act as the rectifier of the Q cycle. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Support for this research was provided by NIH grant GM-27309.
