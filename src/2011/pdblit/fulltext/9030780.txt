Cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) control the cell division cycle (cdc). These kinases and their regulators are frequently deregulated in human tumours. A potent inhibitor of cdks, roscovitine [2-( 1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine], identified by screening a series of C2,P,N9-subwas stituted adenines on purified cdc2/cyclin B. Roscovitine displays high efficiency and high selectivity (Meijer, L., Borgne, A,, Mulner, O., Chong, J. P. J., Blow, J. J., Inagaki, N., Inagaki, M., Delcros, J.-G. & Moulinoux, J.-P. (1997) Eur: J. Biochem. 243, 527-536). It behaves as a competitive inhibitor for ATP binding to cdc2. We determined the crystal structure of a complex between cdk2 and roscovitine at 0.24-nm (2.4 A) resolution and refined to an Rf,,n,, of 0.18. The purine portion of the inhibitor binds to the adenine binding pocket of cdk2. The position of the benzyl ring group of the inhibitor enables the inhibitor to make contacts with the enzyme not observed in the ATP-complex structure. Analysis of the position of this benzyl ring explains the specificity of roscovitine in inhibiting cdk2. The structure also reveals that the (R)-stereoisomer of roscovitine is bound to cdk2. The (&isomer is about twice as potent in inhibiting cdc2kyclin B than the (S)-isomer. Results from structure/activity studies and from analysis of the cdk2hoscovitine complex crystal structure should allow the design of even more potent cdk inhibitors.

Protein kinases are involved in essentially all intracellular regulatory pathways. In view of their essential role in the regulation of the cell division cycle, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk) have been the object of considerable investigation (reviews in [1-91). A typical cdk consists of a catalytic subunit [cdkl (= cdc2)-cdk8] and a regulatory subunit (cyclin A-cyclin H). Cdk proteins are regulated by (a) transcription/translation of their subunits, (b) complex formation, (c) various post-translational modifications (phosphorylation/dephosphorylation), (d) interaction with various protein inhibitors (p16, p21), (e) modifications of their cellular localisation. The crystal structures of cdk2 [lo] and of cdk2kyclin A [ll]have been recently determined, allowing a very precise understanding of the mechanisms of enzyme activation and activity. Numerous examples of cdk deregulation in human primary tumours and in tumour cell lines have been described recently (reviews in [12, 131). These observations encourage the search for selective chemical inhibitors of cdk proteins and the use of natural inhibitors in potential gene therapy [14, 151. Prompted by the abundance of cdc2kyclin B kinase in starfish oocytes, its relatively easy purification by affinity chromatography on p9c7Ks/ p13'""-Sepharose and the rapid assay of its activity with histone H1 and ["PIATP, a few years ago we set up a simple screening test using purified p34'd"2/cyclinBcdc13 a target [16]. as

The first compound to be identified as a cdc2 inhibitor was 6dimethylaminopurine (IC50: 120 pM) [17, 181. This compound was initially synthesized as a puromycin analogue and found to inhibit mitosis of sea urchin embryos without inhibiting protein synthesis [ 191. By structural analogy we identified N6-(d2-isopenteny1)adenine as a slightly more potent kinase inhibitor (ICs,,: 55 pM) [16]. Following extensive screening of a series of substituted purines designed for other purposes, olomoucine [2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine]was identified as a potent cdc2 inhibitor (ICso: 7 pM) [20]. This compound was originally designed as an inhibitor of cytokinin 7glucosyltransferase from radish cotyledons [21]. The unusual specificity of this compound led us to co-crystallise it with cdk2 [22],and to investigate its cellular effects [23, 241. Other cdk inhibitors have been described: staurosporine [I 6, 251, butyrolactone I [26-281, flavopiridol [29-311, suramin [32]. The chemical structures, enzymatic specificities and cellular effects of chemical inhibitors of cdk proteins have been reviewed [33, 341. The purine olomoucine displays a quite narrow selectivity : among 35 kinases tested, it only inhibits cdc2, cdk2, cdk5 and erkl, to a lesser extent [20]. The position of olomoucine in the ATP binding pocket of cdk2 has been determined by analysis of an olomoucine/cdk:! co-crystal [22]. Interestingly the purine ring of olomoucine and ATP are orientated in a totally different manner. Recently, olomoucine was found to stimulate massive apoptosis in cells which have been arrested in G2 by the use of DNA-damaging agents [35]. These encouraging results led us to investigate other C2,iV,N9-substituted adenines as potential cdk inhibitors. We here report the identification of a new potent and

We also report the analysis of a high-resolution X-ray cdk2/roscovitine complex crystal structure. The enzymatic specificity and cellular effects of roscovitine are described in the following paper [36].

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Chemicals. The compounds listed in Table 1 were synthesized by one of us (Havlicek et al., unpublished) with the exception of 2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylaminopurine(20) and

2-(2-hydroxyisobutylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine which were synthesized by D. S. Letham. Purine analogues were usually dissolved as 10-100 mM stock solutions in dimethyl-

(a)

sulfoxide (MeJO). Final Me,SO concentration in the reaction mixture was less than 1 % (by vol.). [y-"PIATP (PB 168) was obtained from Amersham. Buffers. Homogenization buffer: 60 mM glycerol 2-phosphate, 15 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 25 mM Mops pH 7.2, 15 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCIZ, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM sodium vanadate, l mM NaF, l mM phenyl phosphate, 10 pg leupeptin/ml. 10 pg aprotinidml, 10 pg soybean trypsin inhibitor/ ml and 100 pM benzamidine. Buffer C: homogenization buffer but 5 mM EGTA, no NaF and no protease inhibitors. Preparation of starfish M phase oocytes extracts. For large-scale oocyte extracts preparations, gonads were removed from ripe Marthasterias glacialis, and incubated with 10 pM 1methyladenine in Millipore-filtered natural sea water until spawning [37]. By that time all the oocytes had entered the M phase. Oocytes were then removed from the incubation medium by centrifugation, directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C [20, 381. M-phase oocytes were homogenized in homogenization buffer at a ratio of 2 g oocytes/ml buffer. After a 45-min centrifugation at 100000 g, the supernatant was recovered and directly used for affinity-chromatography purification of the p34'd'z/cyclin B kinase on p9CKSh"-Sepharose beads as described 120, 39, 401. Enzyme preparation and assays. p34d'z/cyclin B was purified from M-phase starfish (M. glacialis) oocytes by affinity chromatography on p9CKS"s'-Sepharose beads, from which it was eluted by free p9CKSh" described above [38-411. It was as assayed with 1 mg/ml of histone HI (Sigma, type 111-S) in the presence of 15 pM [y-32P]ATP(3000 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) in a final volume of 30 p1 buffer C 120, 421. After a 10-min incubation at 30"C, 25-pl aliquots of supernatant were spotted onto pieces (2.5X3 cm) of Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, and, after 20 s, the filters were washed five times (for at least 5 min each time) in a solution of 10 ml phosphoric acid/l water. The wet filters were transferred into 6-ml plastic scintillation vials, 5 ml ACS (Amersham) scintillation fluid was added and the radioactivity measured in a Packard counter. Blank values were substracted from the data and activities calculated as molar amount of phosphate incorporatedlmass histone HI during a 10min incubation or as a percentage of maximal activity. Controls were performed with appropriate dilutions of Me,SO. To run initial-rate kinetic experiments, the end-point assay system for ~ 3 4 " protein kinase was used as described above ~'~ except that, on the basis of preliminary trials, appropriate nonsaturating substrate concentrations were applied. p34"'2/cyclin B protein kinase was added such that activity was linear with respect to enzyme concentration and time. In most cases, this required enzyme dilution 3 - 30-fold into buffer C. Velocity data were expressed in terms of rate of molar amount incorporated

into the substrate/amount of enzyme added. Apparent inhibition constants were determined by graphical analysis. Human cdk2 was prepared as described by Rosenblatt et al. [43]. Briefly, Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculovirus containing the human cdk2 gene. The supernatant of cell lysate was loaded over a DEAE-Sepharose column followed by an SSepharose column. The flow-through was loaded onto an ATPaffinity column and eluted by a NaCl gradient. The purified protein is fully functional in assays of cdk2 activation in vitru, and the resulting complex can be fully activated when incubated with partially purified human cdk-activating kinase. Inhibitor soaking and co-crystals. We crystallized cdk2 in the conditions described earlier [43]. Briefly, a cdk2 solution was concentrated to 10 mg/ml by dialysis against 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA. Sitting drops were equilibrated by vapor diffusion at 4°C against reservoirs containing 200 mM Hepes pH 7.4. Diamond and wedge-shaped crystals appeared after 24 days. A gradual increase of the Hepes concentration in the reservoirs (up to 800 mM) produced crystals with average dimensions of about 0.2 mmX0.3 mmX0.3 mm. After cdk2 crystals had formed, small amounts of roscovitine powder were added using a cat's whisker to the crystallisation drops. Most of the crystals cracked after a few days, possibly indicating that binding of the inhibitor to cdk2 induces conformational changes of cdk2. Addition of smaller amounts of inhibitor to the crystallization drops prevented the crystals from cracking. Crystals were soaked for 48 h before data collection. Co-crystallization experiments using the crystallization conditions for cdk2 as well as the sparse matrix method [44] were also undertaken, but so far we have not obtained any X-ray diffracting co-crystals. Preliminary X-ray studies showed that the soaked crystals diffracted to 2.4 A. The crystals were of the same space group as the apoenzyme and the cdk2-ATP crystals. The crystallographic parameters are given in Table 1. Data collection and structure refinement. X-ray diffraction data for the cdk2/roscovitine complex crystal were collected using a Rigaku R-AXIS-I1 imaging plate area detector (Table 1). Refinement of cdk2h-oscovitine complex proceeded with refining the position of the cdk2 apoenzyme model, without its water molecules, as rigid body against the complex data, using XPLOR 3.1 [45]. The R,,,,, of the cdk2/roscov$ine complex decreased from 0.48 to 0.26 with data from 8.0 A to 3.0 A. At this stage F,,-F, maps were calculated. These maps showed clear density for roscovitine bound to the ATP-binding pocket of cdk2. The conformation of residues forming the ATP-binding pocket were checked in simulated annealing omit maps before including the inhibitor molecule in the complex structure. Further refinement in X-PLOR continued with simulated annealing using the slow-cooling protocol [46], followed by alternate cycles of positional refinement and manual rebuilding using the program 0 [47]. Finally, the positions of water molecules were checked and corrected in F,-F, omit maps, for which all water molecules were omitted for F, calculations. Water molecules were modeled into difference densities larger than 3 0.The final model has a Rfi,,to,of 0.18 and a R,,, of 0.27 with good stereochemistry (Table 2). Root-mean-square (rms) differences from ideal geometries for bond lengths and angles were calculated using X-PLOR 3.1 [45]. Protein superpositions based on Ca atoms were obtained using the program LSQKAB from CCP4 [48]. Hydrogen bonds and van der Waal's contacts were assigned with the program CONTACSYM and HBPLUS [49, SO]. The cutoff!or hydrogen bonds and salt-bridges was 3.4 and up to 4.11 A for van der Waal's contacts, depending on the atom type and using standard van der Waal's radii. Comparisons of the common contacts among the different ligands and cdk2 were made by a program

Inhibitor concentration (gM)

Roscovitine, an olomoucine-related purine, inhibits cdcY cyclin B by competition for ATP binding. 6-Dimethylaminopurine was the first-described cdc2 inhibitor of the purine family (Fig. 2 A) [17, 181. We recently described the inhibitory properties of C2.N6,N9-substituted adenines towards cyclin-dependent kinases and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases [20].Among the compounds tested, olomoucine [2-(2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-methylpurine] (Fig. 1) was the (51) most active inhibitor (ICs(,:7 p M and 30 pM, for cdc2/cyclin B and erk-I, respectively) (Fig. 2A). A series of related compounds were synthesized and tested as potential inhibitors of the cdc2kyclin B kinase (Table I). The chemistry of these purines will be described elsewhere (Havlicek et al., unpublished). One of the compounds, 2-hydroxymethylpropylamino-6benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine or 2-(l-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine (102) (Fig. I), renamed roscovitine for convenience, displayed a 10-fold increase in efficacy (IC50: 0.65 pM) when compared to olomoucine (Fig. 2A). As roscovitine contains an asymmetric carbon (Fig. I), the two optical isomers were separately synthesized and tested for their kinase inhibitory activity (Fig. 2 B). The ( R ) isomer displays a slightly higher (ICs,,: yM) activity than the 0.45 (S) isomer (IC,,: 0.95 yM). The racemic (R+S) mixture shows intermediate activity (Fig. 2 B). This isomeric difference was barely detectable with cdk2kyclin E (data not shown). To investigate the mechanism of roscovitine action, kinetic experiments were performed in the presence of increasing roscovitine concentrations, with varying ATP levels (Fig. 3). Double-reciprocal plotting of the data demonstrates that roscovicompetitive inhibitor for ATP. The linearity of the slope versus roscovitine concentration replots qualifies roscovitine as a linear inhibitor (Fig. 3 , inset). The apparent inhibition constant ( K J was 1.2 pM. Olomoucine was recently co-crystallized with cdk2 [22]. Resolution of the crystal structure showed

The enzyme is folded into the typical bilobal structure, with the smaller N-terminal domain consisting predominantly of psheet structure and the larger C-terminal domain consisting primarily of a-helices (Fig. 4). There are no significant differences in the domain orientations between the inhibitor-enzyme complex and the ATP-enzyme complex. The inhibitor binds, as seen for ATP and the purine derivative inhibitors, in the deep cleft between the two domains (Fig. 4).

Conformation of bound roscovitine and ligand binding pocket. The electron density for all atoms of the inhibitor roscovitine is clear and strong (Fig. SA). Roscovitine binds in the ATP-binding pocket, with the purine ring of roscovitine occupying approximately the same region as the purine ring of ATP (Fig. SB). The two ring systems overlap roughly in the same plane. However the purine ring in the roscovitine complex has a different orientation than ATP with respect to the protein (Fig. S B). In this orientation, the N7 of roscovitine is close to the position of the N1 in purine of ATP. In the roscovitine molecule the benzyl ring points towards the outside of the ATP-binding pocket and occupies a region not occupied by any parts of the ATP in the ATP complex. All atomic interactions between roscovitine and cdk2 are schematically shown in Fig. 6 B . There is one chiral center in roscovitine (Fig. 1). The electron density indicates that the bound inhibitor is the (R)stereoisomer of roscovitine, which is more potent than the (S)isomer (Fig. 2 B).

In the roscovitine complex structure, binding to cdk2 is characterized by predominantly hydrophobic and van der Waal's interactions with the same hydrophobic enzyme residues that form the pocket for the adenine base in the ATP complex structure. There are 12 van der Waal's contacts with the purine ring, and 20 with the benzyl ring. The total contacts between roscovitine and cdk2 are 53. Many of the contacts between roscovitine and cdk2 are made by only three residues (IlelO, Leu83 and Leu134) which form a total of 20 contacts, corresponding to 38% of the observed contacts.

Geometric complementarity and buried surfaces areas. The specificity and affinity of a protein and its cognate ligand depend on directional hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, as well as on shape complementarity of the contact surface5 of both partners [53, 541. The shape complementarity is best described as \olvent-accessible surfaces that become buried upon ligand binding. If the complementarity is good, the size of the buried

areas in a protein and its cognate ligand should be similar. In the cdk2-ATP complex the buried areas of ATP (352A') and cdk2 (435 A*) show a close fit. ATP is almost completely inaccessible to solvent and its buried surface amounts to 80%oof the buriefl surface in cdk2. Corresponding values are 326A' and 419 A' for roscovitine and cdk2, respectively, and the buried surface for roscovitine amounts to 78 c/o of the buried surface in cdk2. The cdk2/roscovitine complex shows good complementarity in the area of the purine and benzyl rings.

DISCUSSION
In this paper we describe some new purine inhibitors of cdc2/cyclin B and especially roscovitine, a novel highly efficient C2,N6,N9-substituted adenine which interacts with the ATPbinding site of cdk. The enzymatic specificity and cellular effects of roscovitine are presented in the following paper [36]. By classical enzymological analysis (Fig. 3) we have shown that roscovitine acts as a competitive inhibitor for ATP binding.

Fig. 6. Schematic drawing of cdk2 interactions with ATP (A) and roscovitine (B). Protein side-chain contacts are indicated by lines connecting to the respective residue box while interactions to main-chain atoms are shown as lines to the specific main-chain atom. Van der Waal's contacts are indicated by dotted lines, and hydrogen bonds by broken lines. For the inhibitor all ligand contacts are shown, while for ATP, van der Waal's

contacts to phosphates were omitted for clarity.

The linear character of this inhibition argues against multiple binding sites. Analysis of the roscovitine/cdk2 complex crystal structure further demonstrates that the purine group of roscovitine locates in the pocket where ATP binds in cdk2, as observed with the related compounds olomoucine and isopentenyladenine [22]. The selectivity of roscovitine (see below) once more de-

monstrates that high specificity can be reached even with a competitive inhibitor for ATP. Structurdinhibition relationship studies and analysis of the high-resolution X-ray cdk2/roscovitine and cdk2/olomoucine cocrystal structures provide some insight on the essential features of C2,P,Nc)-substituted adenines and of cdk proteins in their

interaction. They provide the structural basis for understanding specificity and potency of roscovitine compared to other inhibitors as well as the protein's authentic ligand ATP.

General features. The buried surface areas of cdk2 and the inhibitors show higher complementarity for the highly specific cdk2 inhibitors (olomoucine, L868276 and roscovitine), and a lower complementarity for the less-specific cdk2 inhibitor (isopentenyladenine) which agrees with the observed ICs,. The number of van der Wad's contacts between cdk2 and inhibitors also agrees with the observed IC,, values ; the high-specificity inhibitors (low lC5,,) show approximately the same number of van der Waals contacts with cdk2 while isopentenyladenine (high ICJ shows far fewer contacts with cdk2. Purine ring. The purine ring of roscovitine is located in the cdk2 structure in a similar orientation as the purine ring of olomoucine (Fig. 5 C) [22].This orientation is completely different from the orientation of the purine ring of ATP (Fig. 5 B). A very

are completely different from purine derivatives. Furthermore, specificity of the inhibitor for the cell-cycle kinases over noncell-cycle kinases can be obtained by a moiety such as a benzyl group interacting on a protein surface of the ligand-binding pocket common among cell-cycle kinases. This discovery opens the possibility of testing new inhibitor families, in addition to new substituents for the already known lead structures such as flavone and purine derivatives.

interesting common feature stands out in the analysis of the common contacts between cdk2 and different ligands: one hydrogen bond, involving the N of Leu83, is present in all five ligands. This structural feature should be considered when designing new cdk2 inhibitors. Leu83 interacts with roscovitine REFERENCES through two hydrogen bonds, one with N7 of the purine, the 1.

N`-Benzyl substituent. Especially interesting is the region of
cdk2 occupied by the benzyl ring of the roscovitine molecule that is pointing away from the binding pocket (Fig. 5B). This region is not occupied by any parts of the ATP in the ATP complex but contributes with 20 van der Waal's contacts to the benzyl ring of the inhibitor in the cdk2/roscovitine complex. The main contact residues are IlelO, Phe82 and His84, as observed with olomoucine. The position of the benzyl ring of roscovitine is also responsible for the different position of the side-chain of His84 (Fig. 5 B) that is moved away from the binding pocket in the roscovitine complex. The buried surface of cdk2 and the inhibitor shows a very close fit on the area around the benzyl ring suggesting that the benzyl ring is a moiety which increases the specificity for cdk2. Other hydrophobic substituents can replace the benzyl ring (isopentenyl (compare 53 and cyclohexylmethyl (compare 92 and 3-hydroxybenzyl (compare 56 and with essentially conserved inhibitory efficienbies.

C2 side chain. A side chain at C2 appears to be essential: hydroxylated ethylamino and propylamino substitutions provide the most active compounds (96, 99. 100, 101, 102). Isobutyl pentyl ( 0 ) 1 4 and heptyl ( 4 amino substitutions lead to 9) less active compounds. The C2 substituent binds to an area of the ATP-binding pocket occupied by the ribose in the cdk2IATP complex 1221. In addition to the hydroxyl group providing a hydrogen bond, a hydrophobic environment in the C2 substituent appears to be important (Fig. 6B).

N9 side chain. N9 substitution by a hydrophobic residue is important (compare 82. with 46, 20 with 51, 19 with 50, 86 with - 54 with 55 and 51 with 5 3 ) : isopropyl appears to be the 87, most active substituent. In summary, the comparison of the three-dimensional structures of the cdk2/roscovitine complex with the cdk2-ATP complex shows that the hydrophobic purine-binding pocket has a surprising ability to accommodate new molecular structures that
