Ribonuclease MC1 (RNase MC1) isolated from seeds of bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) consists of 190 amino acids and is characterized by a preferential cleavage at the 5 -side of uridine. This uridine specificity distinguishes RNase MC1 from other enzymes belonging to the RNase T2 family. The three-dimensional structures of RNase MC1, in a complex with either 2 -UMP or 3 -UMP, were determined at 1.48 and 1.77 Å resolutions, respectively. The side chains of Gln9 and Asn71 interact with O4 and N3, respectively, of the uracil base by hydrogen bondings. In addition, the uracil base is sandwiched by the hydrophobic side chains of Leu73 and Phe80. Compared with these amino acid residues and corresponding residues in RNases in the RNase T2 family, Gln9 and Phe80 are highly conserved in the RNases in T2 family, while Asn71 and Leu73 in RNase MC1 are variant in sequences. It is thus likely that interactions of the side chains of Asn71 and Leu73 with the uracil base are responsible for the absolute uridine specificity of RNase MC1. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments showed that replacement of Asn by Thr decreased both the catalytic efficiency and the binding affinity by 2.3- and 7.0-fold, respectively, and substitution of Leu73 for Ala predominantly decreased the binding affinity by 14.5-fold, compared with findings in case of wild-type RNase MC1. It is thus demonstrated that Asn71 and Leu73 play an essential role in uridine preference for RNase MC1. © 2000 Academic Press

homology, RNase MC1 belongs to the RNase T2 family typified by fungal RNases, such as RNase T2 from Aspergillus oryzae and RNase Rh from Rhizopus niveus (2). Certain distinct features characterize RNase MC1 and distinguish it from homologous enzymes in RNase T2 family. First, RNase MC1 preferentially cleaves the phosphodiester bond of the NpU (N denotes either A, C, or U); the most favorable substrate being CpU (3), whereas other RNases grouped in the RNase T2 family cleave almost all of the 16 dinucleotide monophosphates at a comparable rate (2). Second, the specificity of RNase MC1 set by uridine at the 3 -terminal side of dinucleotide monophosphates is distinct from fungal RNases in the RNase T2 family as well as smaller RNases in RNase A and RNase T1 families. Generally, RNases have two distinct binding sites: the primary site (B1 site) and subsite (B2 site), for bases located at 5 - and 3 -terminal ends of the scissile bond, respectively. Base specificity is usually related to nature of the interaction at the B1 site with the base located at the 5 -terminal end (4). Thus, a strong interaction of the B2 site with uridine at the 3 -terminal end is a characteristic feature of RNase MC1. Heretofore, the best characterized protein of the RNase T2 family is RNase Rh from R. niveus. The three-dimensional structure was analyzed at 2.0 Å resolution (5) and amino acid residues involved in the catalytic reaction have been mapped, based on sitedirected mutagenesis experiments (6 and references therein). Irie and co-workers studied RNase Rh complexed with dinucleotide monophosphates d(ApC or ApG) and found that Trp49, Asp51, and Tyr57 constitute the B1 site and that Gln32, Pro92, Ser93, Asn94, Gln95, and Phe101 are involved in substrate binding for the cytosine or guanine base at the B2 site (2). We earlier determined the three-dimensional structure of RNase MC1 at 1.75 Å resolution (7). RNase

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS that belongs to the orthorhombic system, space group P2 12 12 1 with cell dimensions of a 38.76 Å, b 67.69 Å, and c 75.42 Å. Data collection of the binary complex made by RNase MC1 and 2 -UMP or 3 -UMP was made at the BL44B2 station of SPring-8, Harima, Japan using a MARCCD camera at room temperature and 100 K, respectively. Because of the dynamic range of the CCD detector, data sets of RNase MC1-2 -UMP and RNase MC1-3 -UMP were collected twice using different exposure times for high and low resolution. All of data sets were processed by MOSFLM (10) and CCP4 suite (11). The summary of data collection and processing is given in Table 1. Structure refinement. The structures of 2 -UMP and 3 -UMP were determined by difference Fourier maps of native and the complexes (RNase MC1-2 -UMP and RNase MC1-3 -UMP). The final models of RNase MC1-2 -UMP or RNase MC1-3 -UMP were obtained by refinement, using program CNS (12) with manual interventions of model modification, using program O (13). The topology restrains of substrates were got from HIC-Up of Uppsala (14) and applied during refinement. After located 107 water molecules, the model of the RNase MC1-2 -UMP complex was refined to an R-factor of 19.4% and an R-free-factor of 21.3% for 10 ­1.48 Å resolution region. The R-factor and R-free-factor of RNase MC1-3 -UMP complex including 83 water molecules were 18.1% and 21.4% for 10 ­1.77 Å resolution region, as given in Table 2. Site-directed mutagenesis. All genetic procedures, including sitedirected mutagenesis, and biochemical procedures for production, purification, and enzymatic analysis of the recombinant RNase MC1 and the mutants thereof have been described elsewhere (8). Details describing mutagenesis experiments of the mutant proteins will be described. Steady-state kinetic analysis. The enzymatic activity toward a dinucleoside monophosphate CpU was measured in 50 mM sodiumphosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 10 ­1000 nM enzyme and appropriate amounts of substrate (8.0 10 5­ 8.0 10 3 M). The incubation was carried out at 37°C for 10 ­30 min and the reaction was terminated by adding 50 l portion of 30% acetic acid. Ten microliter of the reaction mixture was loaded onto reverse-phase HPLC on a Wakosil 5C 18 column (4.6 150 mm) equilibrated with 50 mM KH 2PO 4.

MC1 structurally belongs to the ( ) class of proteins, having ten helices and eight -strands and displays a global topological similarity with the threedimensional structure of RNase Rh: the root-meansquare deviation for 151 C atoms is 1.76 Å. Conformation of the catalytic residues His46, His104, Glu105, Lys108, and His109 in RNase Rh can be superposed with that of the possible catalytic residues His34, His83, Glu84, Lys87, and His88 in RNase MC1. The importance of these residues for the catalytic activity for RNase MC1 was demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis of the residues (8). In this study, to get insight into the structural basis for substrate specificity, we undertook X-ray crystallographic analysis of RNase MC1 complexed with either with 2 -UMP or 3 -UMP. These structures explains how RNase MC1 recognizes the uracil moiety of uridine. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. RNase MC1 was purified from bitter gourd seeds, as described (1). Uridine monophosphates, 2 -UMP and 3 -UMP, and dinucleoside monophosphate CpU were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. All other reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade. Crystallization and data collection. RNase MC1 complexed with the uridylic acids, 2 -UMP or 3 -UMP, was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method under a protein solution concentration of 19 mg/ml. The RNase MC1-3 -UMP crystals were grown within four days to a size of up to 0.3 0.3 0.05 mm 3 under the same conditions as for the native RNase MC1 (9), except that 10 mM 3 -UMP was added. The RNase MC1-2 -UMP crystals were grown up to 0.3 0.2 0.01 mm 3 against a reservoir containing 0.2 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 6.7) with 21% PEG8000 and 10 mM 2 -UMP. The crystals of RNase MC1-2 -UMP and RNase MC1-3 -UMP are isomorphous with the native crystal

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall Structure of the Complex Crystal structures of RNase MC1, complexed with 2 -UMP and 3 -UMP, were determined at 1.48 and 1.77 Å resolutions, respectively. Figure 1 shows the refined structure of RNase MC1 in complex with 2 -UMP that is superposed on the difference Fourier map. A detailed view on the coordination of 2 -UMP in RNase MC1 is shown in Fig. 2. The pyrimidine ring of 2 -UMP lies in a hydrophobic pocket of the molecular surface as is clearly visible in the GRASP representation of the molecular surface (Fig. 3). In the X-ray structure, there is no apparent interaction between RNase MC1 and ribose or phosphate moieties of 2 -UMP. Therefore, the interaction between RNase MC1 and uracil is essential for RNase MC1-2 -UMP recognition. The pyrimidine ring of 3 -UMP is located basically at position identical to that of 2 -UMP (data not shown). This suggested that the binding mode observed in the crystal structures is relevant to uridine binding in the enzymatic reaction. Comparison of these complex structures with

the native structure of RNase MC1 showed no evidence of structural deformation at the uracil binding site. Uracil Binding In the complex, the uracil moiety is fixed to the binding site via a sandwich-like stacking interaction between the hydrophobic side chains of Leu73 and Phe80. In addition, the uracil base is firmly stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds, particularly by the side chain of Asn71 and Gln9, as shown in Fig. 4. The side chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Asn71 accepts a hydrogen bond from the N3 atom of the uracil base (inter-atomic distance of 2.92 Å). The amide nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the side chain of Asn71 are in turn hydrogen bonded to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Ala75 and the main-chain amide nitrogen atom of Leu73, respectively, thereby the orientation of the side chain of Asn71 is fixed. Furthermore, the O4 atom of the uracil moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain amide of Gln9 (2.96 Å) and the mainchain amide of Val72 (2.91 Å). The side-chain amide oxygen of Gln9 also forms a water-mediate hydrogen bond to the side-chain amide of Gln164. Site-Directed Mutagenesis When we compared amino acid residues involved in the B2 site in RNase MC1 with those of other RNases belonging to the RNase T2 family (2), Gln9 and Phe80 are highly conserved in the RNase T2 family, while amino acid residues located in the loop region (pos. 69 ­76) between 4 and 5 are often substituted by other amino acid residues (Fig. 5). This suggested that the amino acid residues on the loop are mainly responsible for the absolute uracil specificity of RNase MC1. To test this thesis, amino acid residues between Asn71 and Arg74 were replaced in turn by corresponding amino acid residues in the Nicotiana glutinosa RNase NW, a guanylic acid preferential RNase (15).

All mutant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells using the expression vector pET22b, and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose Fast Flow followed by hydrophobic chromatography on butyl-Toyopearl 650M, as described for the wild-type RNase MC1 (8). None of these substitutions led to any significant destabilization of the protein and all the mutant proteins could be purified to apparent homogeneity as could the wild-type RNase MC1. The kinetic constants for the enzymatic activity of four mutant enzymes were estimated via hydrolysis of the dinucleoside phosphate CpU as a substrate; the results are given in Table 3. The K m value of the mutant N71T, in which Asn71 was replaced with the corresponding amino acid Thr in RNase NW, increased by 7.0-fold and the k cat value decreased by 2.3-fold, compared with the case of wild-type RNase MC1. Further, the K m value of the mutant L73A significantly increased, though the k cat was much the same as that of the wild-type RNase MC1.

Note. K m, k cat and k cat/K m values are expressed as 10 3 M, min 1 and 10 3 M 1 min 1, respectively. All parameter values are the average values for at least twice in independent experiments.

Consequently, the specificity constants (k cat/K m) for N71T and L73A were reduced to 6 and 7%, respectively, relative to that of the wild-type. In contrast, replacements of Val72 and Arg74 by the corresponding amino acids Leu and Ala, respectively, had little effect on the catalytic activity: the mutants V72L and R74S were almost as active as the wild-type with 90 and 70% activity. Our data show that Asn71 plays an essential role in uracil recognition at the B2 site, increasing both the catalytic efficiency and binding affinity, while Leu73 contributes to uridine preference by increasing the binding affinity. All these results are consistent with observations of the crystal structures. In the present mutagenesis study, the amino acids in RNase MC1 were replaced by the corresponding residues in the guanylic acid preferential RNase NW. It can be anticipated that mutant proteins may have acquired a guanylic acid instead of uridine preference. Indeed, our recent characterization of the RNase MC1 mutant N71T, with respect to substrate specificity, showed a significant guanine preference at the B2 site (T. Numata et al., unpublished results). Hence, knowledge of the substrate binding site and insight into related interactions with the base obtained in the current study will aid in developing a novel RNase with an absolute base specificity, using the RNase MC1 gene as prototype.
