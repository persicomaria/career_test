Bioincorporation of Telluromethionine into Proteins: A Promising New Approach for X-ray Structure Analysis of Proteins
Nediljko Budisa*, Wilhelm Karnbrock, Stefan Steinbacher Andreas Humm, Lars Prade, Torsten Neuefeind, Luis Moroder and Robert Huber
È Max-Planck Institut fur Biochemie, Martinsried Germany A simple and ef®cient method for the speci®c and quantitative replacement of the naturally occurring amino acid methionine by its isosteric analogue telluromethionine in the expression of recombinant proteins has been developed. The method requires a controlable and competitive expression system like the bacteriophage T7 polymerase/promoter in a methionine-auxotrophic host. Using methionine-auxotrophic Escherichia coli strains, incorporation of telluromethionine at high yields has been achieved for human recombinant annexin V, human mitochondrial transamidase, Arabidopsis glutathione-S-transferase and the N-terminal domain of Salmonella tailspike adhesion protein as con®rmed by amino acid, mass-spectrometric and X-ray analyses. Expressed and puri®ed telluromethionine-proteins and native proteins were found to crystallise isomorphously. In terms of ef®cient bio-expression, isomorphism of crystals and relative abundance of methionine residues, the production of telluromethionine-proteins as heavy-atom derivatives offers a valid and general approach in X-ray analysis by the method of multiple isomorphous replacement.

Introduction
Following the early work of Cowie & Cohen (1957), there is considerable interest in the bioincorporation of methionine analogs into proteins. In the early work with selenomethionine (SeMet), the emphasis was on the elucidation of the mechanism of protein biosynthesis, whereas recently, expression of protein analogs containing SeMet or other methionine analogs is mainly used for protein structural studies. This research has been fostered by the development of the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method (Hendrickson et al., 1990) to solve the phase problem in X-ray crystallographic analyses of proteins. Selenium replacing sulphur in Met-residues of proteins has been recognised as a suitable resonAbbreviations used: SeMet, selenomethionine; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous dispersion; TeMet, telluromethionine; wt, wild-type; TSP, tailspike adhesion protein; NMM, new minimal media.

ance centre for anomalous dispersion in MAD-experiments, which require synchrotron radiation with precise beam wavelength control. SeMet offers the possibility of systematic bioincorporation and a perfect isomorphism of the variants with the native protein forms. Bioincorporation of tellurium as telluromethionine (TeMet) is expected to offer similar advantages, but tellurium as heavy-atom in the protein X-ray crystallographic analysis is suf®cient to provide clear signals in both isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps at the commonly used CuKa wavelengths. Therefore, bioincorporation of TeMet represents a new and promising alternative to the usual trial-and-error ``soaking'' procedure to generate suitable heavy-atom derivatives for the classical multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method. The ®rst unsuccessful attempts to produce TeMet-proteins with nutrient media containing 127 Te-labelled H2TeO3 (Kolar, 1974) were based on experiments similar to those performed for the

biosynthesis of 75SeMet-proteins in baker's yeast. Ramadan et al. (1989) studied the growth of tellurium-resistant fungi in the presence of tellurite on the de®ned sulphur-free medium. In thinlayer two-dimensional chromatography unknown amino acids were detected in the protein components which were interpreted as ``the actual incorporation of tellurium into proteins as well as into certain amino acids''. More recently, Boles et al. (1994) reported the serendipitous ®nding that TeMet replaces in a selective manner methionine. In fact, using Escherichia coli Met-auxotroph DL41 recombinant dihydrofolate reductase was expressed with 40% of Met replaced by TeMet as con®rmed by amino acid analyses and atomic absorption spectroscopy. We have described an expression system for the ef®cient bioincorporation of TeMet and other Met analogs into human recombinant annexin V as the model protein (Budisa et al., 1995). This system has been sensibly improved and optimized, and fermentation conditions were developed which lead to quantitative TeMet bioincorporation as exempli®ed with a series of proteins, i.e. human mitochondrial L-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (transamidase, AT, EC 2.1.4.1; 11 Met), the N-terminal domain (amN110; AA 1-124; 13.8 kDa; one Met per monomer) of tailspike adhesion protein (TSP), glutathione-S-transferase from Arabidopsis thaliana (araGST; two Met per monomer) and maize (GST III, EC 2.5.1.18, one Met per monomer;) and the catalytic domain (Met80-Gly242, mNCt, two Met) of human neutrophil collagenase (EC 3.4.24.7). Thereby the bacteriophage T7 promoter/polymerase system was used as the expression system for all these proteins.

The growth of E. coli B834 (DE3) transformed with plasmid pRSET which carries the gene for the annexin V (PP4) in NMM at 37 C, supplemented with the different L-Met (continuous lines) and L-SeMet (dotted lines) concentrations in mM: 0.05 (brown), 0.1 (red), 0.3 (blue), 0.5 (yellow) and 0.8 (green).

Results and Discussion
Fermentation, expression and purification of TeMet-proteins The most suitable approach for bioincorporation of non-natural amino acids is the protein expression in host auxotrophic cells, e.g. in the E. coli metÀ strains ML304D (Cowie & Cohen, 1957), DL42 (Hendrickson et al., 1990) or B834 (Golden et al., 1993). In the minimal medium supplemented with a particular amino acid analog, bacterial growth appears to be linear although the presence of at least trace amounts of the natural amino acid is apparently required. Among all Met analogs analysed in our study only SeMet gives the characteristic pattern of normal growth in the minimal medium. Because of its slight toxicity the culture growth is slow (generation time nearly doubled) in comparison with growth in minimal medium supplemented with Met (Figure 1). By using our minimal medium (NMM) in the presence of different Met concentrations, the stationary phase is reached in about six hours, similarly to that observed by Boles et al. (1994) for E. coli DL42. As shown in Figure 1, the limiting concentrations essential for

successful incorporation of Met-analogs are 0.05 and 0.1 mM Met. At these concentrations in minimal medium, a stationary phase is reached when Met is depleted. Replacement of Met with the appropriate analog, in the present case TeMet, at this point and induction of biosynthesis of the recombinant protein, will result in an accumulation of the protein containing exclusively the amino acid analog (TeMet) in place of the natural methionine. Besides the toxicity of TeMet, an additional dif®culty derives from its remarkable instability towards aeration. This problem was addressed either by changing the medium of the growing culture immediately prior to induction of protein synthesis with fresh medium containing TeMet or by the use of the chemically more stable acetylated TeMet solubilized in small amounts of degassed water and added to the culture medium immediately before induction of protein biosynthesis. For protein labelling in living cells with the highly unstable TeMet or even with other stable, but very toxic analogs, e.g. norleucine or ethionine (S-ethyl-homocysteine), it is essential to obtain a full selection pressure in the terms of: (1) strong auxotrophism of the host strain during the fermentation procedure; (2) ef®cient control of the cloned gene by the promoter; and (3) competitive expression system capable of using cytosolic enzymatic machinery to express mainly the target gene after induction of protein synthesis. A quantitatively labelled protein is the result of good control of background gene expression. In fact, in the presence of background expression (``gene leakage'') before induction of protein synthesis, the labelled protein was found to be contaminated by the parent protein as well as assessed by the mass spectrometric analysis of araGST where approximately half of the protein population is labelled with TeMet and the rest with SeMet (Figure 2).

this experiment, SeMet was present from the beginning of growth in the minimal medium instead of Met. In the amino acid analysis of TeMet-proteins expressed in systems without ``gene leakage'', e.g. annexin V, Met was detected at levels dependent upon the initial Met concentration in the medium. For example, 0.6 or 0.8 Met residue 7 TeMet-containing human recombinant annexin V were determined with initial Met concentrations of 0.05 or 0.1 mM, respectively. In mass spectrometric analysis the wild-type peak is absent. By replacing these initial amounts of Met with the same amounts of N-acetylated SeMet, the resulting TeMet-protein reveals nearly complete absence of Met in the amino acid analysis of the puri®ed protein (less than 0.02 Met/7 TeMet-annexin V). The mass spectrometric analysis of the protein yields only the correct mass value of a fully TeMet-substituted protein. The residual Met contents in the protein samples may possibly derive from the fact that the target gene is not perfectly ``silent'' before induction of the protein synthesis. Alternatively, the presence of trace amounts of contaminant proteins cannot be excluded. While SeMet allows for biosynthesis in yields close to that of wt protein, the expression of recombinant proteins in the presence of the highly toxic TeMet in the medium is remarkably reduced. Using annexin V as a model protein and a minimal medium of 0.3 mM Met we obtained protein yields of about 10 mg/l and 8 mg/l using the same concentration of SeMet, while in the presence of 0.2 mM TeMet, the yield was lowered to about 2 mg per liter of the culture. High chemical instability and toxicity of TeMet for the cells may be the main cause for these low yields, that are, however, considerably enhanced by using the N-acetylated SeMet and TeMet. In fact, for SeMet-proteins wt yields were obtained, while for TeMet-proteins the expression was almost doubled (4 mg/l). Both better bioavailability and a higher chemical stab-

ility of the N-acetylated derivatives (Karnbrock et al., 1996) under these fermentation conditions are the most likely reason for this improved biosynthesis. This is further supported by the unchanged yellow colour of the culture with acetylated TeMet, whereas with TeMet it turns black. In the experiments performed here we observed that a successful bioincorporation of TeMet requires the protein to be expressed in its folded form, since in the unfolded form the highly reactive TeMet residues become solvent-accessible and undergo chemical reactions, e.g. oxidation with concomitant degradation. This has been well documented in the case of the recombinant catalytic domain of human collagenase, which is expressed as inclusion bodies. While the related SeMet analog was obtained in its active form, attempts to produce the TeMet analog failed. These dif®culties could possibly be bypassed by co-expression of chaperones or biosynthesis in an alternative host cell such as yeast, mammalian or insect. Therefore, expression of TeMet proteins in eukaryotic cells is an attractive direction for future research, since auxotrophic yeast cells or mammalian cells, which are natural auxothrops for methionine, may possibly provide a milieu where protein misfolding or aggregation is less likely to occur than in microbial expression systems. The danger of solvent exposure of TeMet residues was con®rmed with protein GST III from maize that contains only one Met residue. This Met is surface-exposed as shown by its X-ray crystallographic analysis (our unpublished material). The SeMet analog of this protein could be expressed and crystallised without dif®culty, but crystallisation of the related TeMet analog failed although quantitative amino acid analysis of the isolated protein clearly indicated the absence and thus quantitative replacement of Met. Tellurium chemistry, metabolism and stability Tellurium follows sulphur and selenium in the group VI elements and is in some aspects quite distinct from them. The electronegativities of sulphur (2.58) and selenium (2.55) are similar but differ from that of tellurium (2.0), as do their atomic radii Ê Ê Ê (S, 1.04 A; Se, 1.17 A; Te, 1.37 A). Similarly, tellurium has a larger electrovalent and co-ordination sphere radius which results in higher metallicity and distinctive chemical properties in comparison to sulphur and selenium. Therefore, the chemical properties and the stability of organotellurium compounds are rather unpredictable (Knapp, 1979). We have observed a markedly increased stability of Ac-D,L-TeMet (t1/2  20 hours) in comparison to L-TeMet (t1/2  30 minutes) in non-degassed aqueous solution at room temperature (Karnbrock et al., 1996). Nonetheless as oxidation occurs dihydroxytelluride is formed that can be converted by glutathione to the telluride in the same manner as

described for diphenyl telluroxide (Detty et al., 1994). In this way, oxidized Ac-D,L-TeMet could be taken up by bacteria, reconverted to Ac-D,L-TeMet in the reducing intracellular environment, processed by the endogenous aminoacylase and incorporated into the target recombinant protein. As shown by the ef®cient expression of TeMet-proteins, this methionine analog is accepted by the host translational machinery, i.e. activated with Met-tRNA synthetase, charged onto tRNAMet, and incorporated into the polypeptide chain at all the positions normally occupied by Met, probably including N-terminal ones. In terms of structural properties, the TeMet-proteins were found to be similar to the native forms. Ê It is known that single C± Te bonds are 0.2 A and Ê 0.33 A longer than C± Se and S ±C single bonds, respectively. The question arises as to whether these signi®cantly different bond-lengths may affect the three-dimensional structure of proteins. Taking into account the remarkable plasticity, i.e. the ability of a protein to retain its native state and tolerate small sequence modi®cations, it is reasonable to ex-

pect that the overall protein conformation will be retained despite TeMet incorporation. Indeed, our results show that replacement of de®ned Met residues with TeMet in the hydrophobic core of proteins occurs without signi®cant alterations (Figures 3a, 4a, 3b, 4b, 3c and 4c). The only serious problem in this context is the chemical instability of TeMet. Surface and near-surface Met positions replaced with TeMet often undergo unde®ned chemical modi®cations. In the X-ray analysis of recombinant human annexin V electron density peaks, corresponding to TeMet299 and TeMet259, which are closely located, could not be identi®ed, but a strong peak between them (pronounced density above 12 s) is seen which we were unable to assign. Those methionine residues are surfacelocated but not directly solvent-exposed. The two TeMet residues are probably the main reason for the high Riso value of 26.1%, and consequently the local non-isomorphism seen as uninterpretable and broken densities around TeMet299 and TeMet259 after re®nement. Interestingly, in the hydrophobic environment of transamidase two closely spaced

assay. Although the CD spectrum (Figure 5) is characterized by reduced dichroic intensities, the shape is consistent with a typical a-helical protein, indicating that the overall secondary structure is retained despite replacement of all Met residues. The observed reduced CD intensities may possibly derive from aggregation phenomena promoted by the surface and near-surface-located TeMet sidechains, as deduced from the UV spectra of this protein analog. The voltage-dependent channel activity of TeMet-annexin V was similar to that of some mutants of the native protein. This may be due to the possible chemical reaction of two TeMet residues located near the Ca2 binding site of annexin V. Native, SeMet, and TeMet-annexin V were also analysed for their folding stability in function of different denaturants, i.e. urea, guanidinium hydrochloride and temperature. The melting temperature (tm) of annexin V was found to be lowered by about 6 deg.C in the TeMet-analog (unpublished data). Moreover, the speci®c activities of araGST and of transamidase are not signi®cantly changed upon TeMet-bioincorporation.

Attributes and perspectives of TeMet as a tool for protein structure determination SeMet bioincorporation into proteins represents a general approach to the MAD-method, since several requirements are ful®lled: (i) convenience of the labelling procedure, (ii) high isomorphism with the parent molecule, (iii) stability of the amino acid analog, (iv) phasing power, relative abundance and mobility of target sites (Hendrickson et al., 1990). Moreover, there are a few examples where it was used as a useful isomorphous derivative in a standard MIR experiment (e.g. see Reinemer et al. 1996). We found that TeMet-labelled proteins meet all these criteria as well, without the need of synchrotron radiation and the technically demanding MAD experiments. Tellurium is not as suitable as selenium as a resonance centre in MAD experÊ iments since its absorption edge is about 0.3 A but it is a suitable heavy-atom for isomorphous replacement. Methods of site-directed mutageneses allow us to eliminate or introduce an arbitrary number of Met residues into proteins, possibly generating an unlimited number of derivatives. However, there are some limitations. First, the protein under investigation should be expressed in the folded form, since formation of inclusion bodies may expose highly reactive TeMet sidechains to the solvent. Chemical reactions at the TeMet side-chain may lead to toxic effects on the translational machinery. Second, target Met residues positioned in the hydrophobic protein interior are more suitable for replacement with TeMet than those of the surface or other solvent-accessible areas. As shown here with the proteins araGST and maize GST III, the Met residues in araGST Ê (Met99 and Met103 with B factors of 13.4 A2 and Ê 2, respectively) are protected by a hydro14.9 A

Ê (about 4. 5 A distance) TeMet residues (TeMet130 and TeMet371) are clearly distinguishable at the 4 s contouring level (Figure 4a). Surface exposure of TeMet residues may lead to their chemical degradation, as shown by Boles et al. (1994), Budisa et al. (1995) and in this study. However, it depends if the structural context as intact surface-exposed TeMet214 is found in annexin V according to the mass spectrometric and even Xray analyses (Budisa et al., 1995). In the difference Ê Fourier map (FTeMet À FNati) at 2.5 A resolution a small positive peak with a height of about 4 s was found near TeMet214. This value is lower than that of other peaks (Budisa et al., 1995) but may be due Ê to the high crystallographic B-factor (50.8 A2). The presence of a chemically intact Te atom in this position may be explained if it is co-ordinated to other neighbouring chemical groups. Unfortunately, our re®nement did not allow for more precise interpretations. However, similar results were obtained with two of the 11 TeMet residues in the transamidase which are also surface exposed. The heterogeneity of the transamidase sample in solution excludes an unambiguous mass spectrometric analysis of this protein. Heterogeneity in solution is also the property of the N-terminal domain of TSP, which has only one Met (Met90) exposed to the solvent, but probably shielded by a neighbouring monomer strand (Figure 4c). We have also examined the bioactive properties of the telluromethionyl-proteins. The TeMet-annexin V was found to be functionally intact as it is able to bind to liposomes and to generate Ca2 in¯uxes into liposomes as assessed by the fura-2

erologous expression in Met auxotrophic strains of E. coli (E. coli B834(DE3) and E. coli B834(DE3)pLysS). These strains (parental lysogenated Met auxotrophs of the strain E. coli BL21) contain highly selective T7 RNA polymerase. Bacterial cells were transformed with plasmids with target genes under the control of the T7 promoter. Fermentation conditions were carried out in New Minimal Media (NMM: Budisa et al., 1995) with lowered concentrations of phosphate buffer (22 mM KH2PO4 and 50 mM K2HPO4). Cultures were grown under the selective pressure of 100 mg/l ampicillin while cultures with pLysS strains had the addition of chloramphenicol (25 mg/l). Stock solutions of methionine (L-Met) and its acetylated derivatives (Ac-D,L-methionine) and their analogs were: 0.335 M (L-Met and Ac-D,L-Met); 5.09 mM (D,LSeMet and Ac-D,L-SeMet), while L-TeMet and Ac-D,LTeMet stock solutions were prepared immediately prior to the experiment (induction of bacterial cells) at a concentration of 2 mM (0.5 g/l) in degassed, argon-saturated double-destilled water in an argon atmosphere. Ac-D,LTeMet can be solubilized in even smaller volumes (50 mg in 3 to 5 ml of pure degassed water). Since amino acid analysis of TeMet proteins (see Results and Discussion) always show a certain amount of Met, the protocol was modi®ed. Cultures were incubated for 10 to 12 hours in NMM with 0.05 or 0.1 mM Ac-D,L-SeMet (until the growth was stabilized), and Ac-D,L-TeMet was added after exchange of the medium or directly (without exchange) in a small volume (50 mg in 3 to 5 ml for one litre of the NMM media) following induction of protein synthesis (three to six hours). From a series of experiments examining the function of concentrations of Met analogs in the culture media, the optimal concentration of SeMet was found to be 0.3 mM and for TeMet, 0.2 mM. The colour of the culture after overnight fermentation was found to be dependent upon the Met analogs used: L-SeMet, faint orange, AcD,L-SeMet, faint yellow (like normal Met-containing culture); L-TeMet in light-protected ¯asks, from initial faint yellow to greyish black, similar to that observed by Boles et al. (1994); Ac-D,L-TeMet, remains faint yellow. In both cases the culture developed a garlic-like smell. Genes for GST were inserted into the pET3a plasmid, which was used for transformation of the E. coli B834(DE3). After induction, proteins were expressed and puri®ed in soluble form according to the protocol used by Reinemer et al. (1996). Glycine amidinotransferase (AT) is also expressed in its soluble form from plasmid pRSETAT38H (pRSET-5d with gene sequence for AT with His-tag) in E. coli B834(DE3)pLysS and puri®ed through a Ni-gelated agarose colomn (Humm et al., 1997). The N-terminal domain of TSP was expressed after transformation of E. coli B834(DE3) with plasmid pTSP8 (derivative of pET11a plasmid with a 131 amino acid long N-terminal domain of TSP). Soluble protein was puri®ed using Chelating Sepharose FF followed with gel ®ltration over Sephadex 75 PG (Steinbacher et al., 1997). The catalytic domain of collagenase was expressed in the insoluble (inclusion body) form in E. coli B834(DE3), according to procedure described by Pieper et al. (1997). Analytical and crystallographic techniques Mass spectrometric and amino acid analyses were performed as described (Budisa et al., 1995). Figure 2 shows

phobic environment and thus, were successfully replaced with TeMet (Figure 3b) in contrast to the solvent-exposed Met3 of maize GST III (B factor of Ê 53.3 A2). Although, araGST provides an example of how ``gene leakage'' leads to incomplete labelling (only about half the Met residues were replaced by TeMet, as evaluated from the mass spectrum (see Figure 2)), it is possible to ®nd peaks in the difference TeMet À Nati Patterson map for araGST. This gives hope for even imperfect (``leaky'') expression systems to produce proteins with suf®ciently high occupancy to permit a heavy-atom peak search and subsequent phase calculations. Crystals of TeMet-proteins were found to be stable over months in normal harvesting buffers under aerobic conditions. Similarly, the TeMetproteins are suf®ciently stable to X-ray exposure. An additional limitation of the TeMet approach was found to be the large number of Met residues present in some proteins that makes interpretation of difference Patterson maps dif®cult, e.g. seven sites in annexin V and 11 sites in transamidase. On the other hand, the structure analysis of transamidase represents an example of how even a larger number of TeMet residues may be useful. During initial chain-tracing the TeMet derivative was not available but, after the collection of its data, ten Te sites were identi®ed in the difference Fourier map, phased with the model combined MIR phases at Ê 5 A resolution, resulting in signi®cantly improved electron density maps (Humm et al., 1997). Since bioincorporation of TeMet is site-speci®c, this feature can help in chain tracing as well demonstrated by the amino acid sequence assignment and connectivity identi®cations in transamidase (Humm et al., 1997). Conversely, in the case of the N-terminal domain of TSP containing two trimers per asymmetric unit (one TeMet per monomer; see Figure 3a) the phasing was successful and the structure was solved using crystals of the TeMetprotein and of a uranium derivative (their phasing powers were 2.16 and 2.00). For more details see Steinbacher et al. (1997). In conclusion, although the production of TeMet-proteins directly provides heavy-atom derivatives of proteins for X-ray crystallography, the expression still presents a challenge because of the extreme sensitivity of TeMet to oxidation, and high toxicity to the host cells. Moreover, as mentioned above, the abundance of Met residues in proteins may raise additional dif®culties. Thus, alternative residues, e.g. tryptophan, may represent useful targets for heavy-atom replacements via bioincorporation of the related heavy-atom analogs.

the analysis of TeMet incorporation in araGST, where agreement between expected and calculated mass for the replacement of two Met residues per monomer is good for SeMet-araGST (found, 24,094.4(Æ5.4) Da, calculated, 24,091.8 Da) as well as for TeMet-araGST (found, 24,191.0(Æ6.1) Da, calculated, 24,196.28 Da). Since the Nterminal domain of TSP, GST III from maize, and transamidase samples show heterogeneity it was not possible to correctly evaluate their masses by mass spectrometry analyses. In these cases, evaluation of Met replacement was based on the absence of the Met peak from the amino acid composition chromatograms. TeMet and SeMet-containing proteins exhibit similarly the absence of the Met peak, but X-ray analysis with calculated difference Fourier maps showed a clear difference between the two metals. Crystallisation experiments were carried out at room temperature or in the cold room (4 C) by the vapour diffusion method. Crystallisation of the SeMet-collagenase catalytic domain and maize SeMet-GST III were performed under the same conditions as for wt protein, while the TeMet variants failed to crystallise (see Results and Discussion). Crystallographic techniques, data collection and calculations for annexin V were as described (Budisa et al., 1995). The TeMet araGST protein crystals were obtained under the conditions described by Reinemer et al. (1996). Isomorphous TeMet crystals of maximum dimensions 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.8 mm were obtained within two weeks at 4 C and harvested into the reservoir solution. With space group P63, one dimer per asymmetric unit Ê Ê and lattice constants a  b  114 A, c  70 A, a  b 90 , Ê g 120 they diffract to at least 2.2 A resolution with completeness of 95%. The TeMet transamidase was crystallised at room temperature under the conditions described by Humm et al. (1997). Crystals were grown after about two weeks to dimensions too small for X-ray analysis. They were then used for macro seeding and gave crystals of up to 0.8 mm Â 0.4 mm Â 0.4 mm. The isomorphous tetragonal crystals of bipyramidal shape belonged to the space Ê group P43212 with lattice constants a  b  83.6 A, Ê and a  b  g 90 and diffracted up to 3.0 A Ê c  200 A with overall completeness of 77.4% and one molecule per asymmetric unit. The TeMet N-terminal domain of TSP crystallises at room temperature under the same conditions as the native protein (Steinbacher et al., 1997). Crystals were Ê of space group P21 with cell constants of a  57 A, Ê Ê b  82 A, c  73 A, a  b  90 , g  90.9 , two trimers in Ê the asymmetric unit and diffracted at 2.3 A with 95% completeness. For the purposes of structure determination TeMet crystals (Riso  21%) were used for the soaking experiments and as parent native crystals. In all cases, diffraction data were collected on an X-ray imaging plate system (Mar Research) in a thermostated room at 18 C, using CuKa radiation from a Rigaku rotating anode generator operated at 4.5 kW. Re¯ections were integrated with the program MOSFLM (Leslie, 1991), scaled and reduced using ROTAVATA/ AGROVATA of the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Crystallographic calculation were mostly performed with PROTEIN È (Steigemann, 1991) and X-PLOR (Brunger, 1987). Difference maps were inspected on a computer graphic display utilising the programs FRODO (Jones, 1978) or O (Jones et al., 1991).

Telluromethionine-containing Proteins CD measurements Spectra were recorded on an dichrograph mark IV (Jobin Yvon) at 25 C using quartz cells of 0.1 cm optical path. The concentrations of the samples were adjusted to 2.2 Â 10À6 M in 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5). The data are averages of ten scans and results are expressed in mean residue molar ellipticity (y) in degrees Â cm2 Â dmolÀ1. Estimation of secondary structure of CD curves in the 195 to 250 nm range was derived by the method of Chen et al. (1974).
