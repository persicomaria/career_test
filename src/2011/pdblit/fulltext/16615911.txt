Abstract Disabled-1 (Dab1) is a cytosolic adaptor protein that plays critical roles in cortical development. However, a detailed mechanism of action has not yet been clearly defined. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we observed that mouse Siah-1A, an E3 ubiquitin ligase containing a RING finger motif, interacts with Dab1. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and in vitro binding experiments both indicated direct interaction between Siah and Dab1. Steady-state expression of Siah was enhanced by the presence of Dab1 or lactacystin, a representative proteasomal inhibitor. Auto-ubiquitination of Siah was inhibited by the presence of Dab1, suggesting inhibition of Siah activity and subsequent increase of Siah expression by Dab1. Both Dab1-induced increase of steady-state expression of Deleted in cololectal cancer (DCC), one of the well-known substrates of Siah, and its inhibition by SiahDR suggest that Dab1 increases expression of DCC through inhibiting the activity of endogenous Siah. Our results suggest that Dab1 inhibits the activity of Siah. ” 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Disabled is a well-known cytosolic adaptor protein and was first identified as one of the five HDA (haploinsufficient, dependent upon Drosophila Abl; dAbl) genes that exacerbate the dAbl¿ phenotype when they are mutated [1]. Drosophila Abl (dAbl) protein is involved in nervous system development in Drosophila and is mainly expressed in the cell bodies and axons of neurons of the developing central nervous system (CNS) [1,2]. Flies lacking the dAbl gene develop past metamorphosis but die near eclosion [3]. Disabled-1 (Dab1) is essential for normal CNS development even in the presence of dAbl [4]. The mouse homolog of Dab1 was cloned using its interaction with Src in a yeast two-hybrid screening [5]. Mouse Dab1 is primarily expressed in the brain and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family tyrosine kinases such as Src, Fyn, and Abl. Correct cortical development is critically dependent upon the outward migration of neuronal precursor cells from the ventricular proliferative zone to the superficial area, generating a laminated structure. Migration is

controlled by reelin, which is secreted from Cajal-Retzius cells (for review, see [6]). Absence of either reelin or Dab1 causes abnormal cortical development with disordered lamination, suggesting that Dab1 plays a key role in reelin-involved cortical development. According to current hypotheses, Dab1 is activated when reelin binds to a pair of redundant receptors, the apoE receptor 2 (ApoER2) and the VLDL receptor (VLDLR). In addition, Dab1 has been considered to be implicated in apoE signaling and Alzheimer’s disease through its interaction with many kinds of membrane proteins including Notch, LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), LDL receptor, Alzheimer precursor protein (APP), and APP-like proteins (APLPs) via its N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (reviewed by [7,8]). Therefore, Dab1 is highly likely to play important roles in brain development and Alzheimer’s disease. However, both the mechanism by which Dab1 can be activated and downstream signaling cascades are still unclear. To better understand the functional role of Dab1 in cortical development we carried out yeast two-hybrid screening with Dab1 as the bait.

Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were generated from pGEX-4T-2 plasmids in BL21 cells and affinity purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). In vitro synthesis of proteins was performed in clones with the plasmids pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) using the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). For the in vitro binding assay, GST fusion proteins were incubated in the presence of glutathione Sepharose beads with either total cell lysates from transfected cells or with in vitro translated proteins at 4 ∞C for 4≠6 h. Binding and washing of beads were conducted in PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2 HPO4 , and 1.8 mM KH2 PO4 ) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. Bead-conjugated complexes were washed extensively, and then boiled in Laemmli-SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS≠PAGE followed by Western blot. GST fusion proteins were stained with Coomassie blue to ensure equal loading. RNA isolation and RT-PCR. Total RNA from transfected 293T cells was isolated with RNA aqueous kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase II (Life Technologies) using an oligod(T) primer. For PCR amplification, an aliquot of the cDNA reaction was added to a reaction buffer containing dNTP mixture (200 uM each), 1 lM of oligonucleotide primers, and 2 U TaKaRa LA Taq DNA polymerase. Thirty amplification cycles were conducted as follows: denaturation at 95 ∞C for 1 min, annealing at 55 ∞C for 1 min, and extension at 72 ∞C for 1 min in a Minicycler (MJ Research). The resultant amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Primers for PCR using RNA prepared from 293T cells were designed using the Primer3 program developed by Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research and were as follows: the forward primer 50 -TACCAGTAC ATTGTGTTTGAGGCT-30 and the reverse primer 50 -AGATGTCA AAGTCATCACAGTCGT-30 for human Dab1; the forward primer 50 -GTCTGCTTTGACTATGTGTTACCG-30 and the reverse primer 50 -GTGTTCCTATCAGCTGTACGATTG-30 for human Siah-1A; the forward primer 50 -ATGGATGATGATATCGCCGCGCTC-30 and the reverse primer 50 -CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATG-30 for human b-actin. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis of data was carried out using unpaired Student’s t test for comparison between two experimental groups. Differences were considered to be significant when probability (p) values were <0.05.

[9,10], was found to interact with Dab1. Here we demonstrate that the activity of Siah is inhibited by Dab1 through direct protein≠protein interaction.

Materials and methods
Yeast two-hybrid screening. The ProQuest two-hybrid system (Life Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The pDBLeu and the pPC86 plasmids encode the DNA-binding domain and the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4, respectively. DNA-binding domain fusion constructs were generated by cloning cDNA fragments of Dab1 in-frame with the GAL4 sequence in the pDBLeu vector. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Adult mouse whole brain cDNA library was purchased from Life Technologies. DNA-binding fusions were as follows: pDBLeu-Dab11, amino acids 1≠179 of mouse Dab1; pDBLeu-Dab1-2, amino acids 156≠324 of mouse Dab1; pDBLeu-Dab1-3a, amino acids 322≠408 of mouse Dab1; and pDBLeu-Dab1-3b, amino acids 409≠555 of mouse Dab1. cDNAs and antibodies. For mammalian expression, mouse Dab1 cDNA from adult C57BL/6J mouse brain was cloned into either pCAGGS with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) tag or pcDNA3 with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag. Mouse Siah-1A cDNA was cloned into EGFP-tagged pCAGGS or PCXN2 with a flag tag. A fulllength rat deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 was provided by Dr. M. Tessier-Lavigne, University of California San Francisco. Human ubiquitin cDNA with an HA tag was generously donated by Dr. S. Hatakeyama. Polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal 15 amino acid-peptide of mouse Dab1 and against the Dab1-binding region (aa 80≠282) of mouse Siah-1A were raised in rabbit and affinity purified with HiTrap Protein G and HiTrap NHS-activated columns (Amersham), respectively. Mouse anti-DCC antibody (AF5) was purchased from Oncogene Research products. Mouse anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and rabbit anti-HA antibodies were obtained from Medical and Biological Laboratories (Japan). Mouse anti-flag antibody was purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell culture and transfection experiments. Human embryonic kidney cell line 293T was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin≠streptomycin. Transient transfections of 293T cells were carried out using the standard calcium phosphate method. The total transfected DNA was kept to constant in each transfection experiment. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Approximately 48 h following transfection of 293T cells with Siah, Dab1, and DCC expression vectors, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris≠HCl adjusted to pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na3 VO4 , 10% glycerol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). After quantifying the protein content of each cell lysate using BCA assay (Pierce), total cell lysates containing the same amount of protein were loaded, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate≠polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS≠PAGE), and transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Membranes were then subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunodetection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit for Western blotting detection (ECL, Amersham). Where indicated, protein bands were captured from membranes after ECL detection and quantified using a Fujifilm advanced luminescent image analyzer system LAS-1000plus. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysate was precleared with 10 ll protein G≠Sepharose and incubated with anti-Dab1, anti-Siah polyclonal antibodies, or rabbit preimmune serum together with protein G≠Sepharose at 4 ∞C for 4≠6 h. After washing three times with lysis

Results Dab1 interacts with Siah in vivo and in vitro To identify new binding partners of Dab1, four constructs of mouse Dab1 were cloned into the pDBLeu bait vector. Dab1-1 contained the N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain [5]. Dab1-2 contained several tyrosine residues that are thought to be phosphorylated by Src family tyrosine kinase [11,12]. Two Cterminal constructs, Dab1-3a and Dab1-3b, were also generated. A mouse brain cDNA library was constructed in the GAL4 activation domain vector pPC86. When Dab1-3a was used as bait in the screening, the Cterminal 202 amino acids of mouse Siah-1A, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila seven in absentia (Sina), were found to interact with Dab1 (data not shown).

Fig. 1. Interaction of Dab1 with Siah in mammalian cells. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing EGFP-tagged Dab1 and flag epitope-tagged Siah-1A. Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-Dab1, anti-Siah antibodies, or rabbit preimmune serum (negative control). Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS≠PAGE/immunoblotting with anti-GFP or anti-flag antibodies.

To investigate whether Dab1 interacts with Siah in mammalian cells, co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed. 293T cells were cotransfected with both Dab1 cDNA tagged with EGFP and flag epitope-tagged Siah. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Dab1 antibody, anti-Siah antibody, or rabbit preimmune serum and then subjected to immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-GFP and anti-flag antibodies. As seen in Fig. 1, Dab1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Siah. Although Dab1 is approximately 80 kDa in size, addition of the EGFP tag to Dab1 caused a shift in migration to approximately 120 kDa. Siah was also coprecipitated by anti-Dab1 antibody. However, neither Dab1 nor Siah was detected when cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with rabbit preimmune serum, suggesting that the interaction is specific. Because Dab1 is phosphorylated at tyrosine residues by Src family tyrosine kinases, we tested whether the interaction of Dab1 with Siah was affected by the presence of Fyn. Cotransfection of cells with Fyn cDNA induced tyrosine

phosphorylation of Dab1 (data not shown). In the presence of Fyn, Dab1 was still co-immunoprecipitated with Siah (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction is independent of Dab1 phosphorylation under our experimental conditions. We also investigated HA epitope-tagged Dab1. When immunoprecipitated samples were immunoblotted with both mouse monoclonal antiflag antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-Siah antibody, Siah was strongly coprecipitated with Dab1 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that Dab1 interacts with Siah in mammalian cells. We then examined whether Dab1 and Siah interact directly. Because the N-terminal RING domain of Siah plays a catalytic role and is responsible for the degradation of Siah itself, we generated GST-SiahDR, which lacks the N-terminal RING domain, and used it for binding experiments (Fig. 2A). When cell lysate from 293T cells expressing transfected Dab1 was incubated with GST-SiahDR, Dab1 was precipitated with glutathione Sepharose (Fig. 2B). However, GST did not lead to the precipitation of Dab1. When in vitro translated Dab1 was used, similar results were obtained (Fig. 2C). These results suggest the direct interaction of Dab1 with Siah. The binding between Siah and Dab1 was further characterized by in vitro binding experiments using in

vitro synthesized Siah and purified GST-Dab1 constructs (Fig. 2A). Because the C-terminus of Dab1 is thought to be responsible for Dab1-Siah interaction based on the results of yeast two-hybrid screening, three GST-Dab1 fragments were generated and used in the GST pull-down assay in order to map the binding site of Dab1. GST-Dab1-3 containing the C-terminus mimicked GST-Dab1 in its ability to precipitate Siah (Fig. 2D). Unexpectedly, GST-Dab1-1, which contains the Nterminus, also precipitated in vitro translated Siah. However, GST-Dab1-2, which contains the middle part of Dab1, did not precipitate Siah. GST-Dab1-1 binding with Siah was confirmed by the observation that GSTDab1-12, containing both the middle part (Dab1-1) and N-terminus (Dab1-2) of Dab1, also precipitated Siah (data not shown). These results suggest that Dab1 has two binding sites for Siah. Our results clearly indicate that Dab1 interacts with Siah in vivo and in vitro. Dab1 increases the expression of Siah Because Siah is a ubiquitin ligase enzyme, proteins that interact with Siah can act as substrates of Siah and be degraded by the ubiquitin≠proteasome pathway. To date, several Siah-interacting proteins such as DCC [13],

nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) [14], BOB.1/ OBF.1 [15,16], and recently Numb [17] have been shown to act as substrates of Siah. We therefore tested whether steady-state expression of Dab1 is affected by co-transfection with Siah. As shown in Fig. 3A, the Dab1 protein expression was not altered by Siah when Dab1 was detected using anti-Dab1 antibody. Similar results were obtained when Dab1 was detected using anti-HA antibody (data not shown). In contrast, Siah expression was significantly enhanced when cells were cotransfected with either EGFP- or HA-tagged Dab1 (Fig. 3B). A representative proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin dramatically increased the expression of Siah. A similar increase was observed when cells were treated with another proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 (data not shown). The effect of proteasomal inhibitors on Siah expression is consistent with a previous report by Hu and Fearon [18]. These results suggest that degradation of Siah through the ubiquitin≠proteasome pathway is inhibited by Dab1 binding to Siah, and locking it in an inactive state. Dab1 inhibits ubiquitination of Siah Siah is known to ubiquitinate itself [10], suggesting that Siah is regulated by auto-ubiquitination. We investigated the effect of Dab1 on this auto-ubiquitination of Siah. As shown in Fig. 4, levels of ubiquitinated Siah were increased in the presence of ubiquitin and lactacystin. Band intensities for all these forms were then decreased upon Dab1 co-transfection. However, the amount of Siah was increased in the presence of Dab1. This suggests that the ubiquitin ligase activity of Siah is inhibited by Dab1. Therefore, the Dab1-induced inhibition of Siah activity appears to stabilize the protein and increase its concentration. Dab1 increases expression of DCC To further characterize the effect of Dab1 on Siah activity, we used DCC, a well-known Siah substrate [13,18]. As shown in Fig. 5A, expression of DCC was decreased by Siah, confirming the results of a previous report [13]. Interestingly, we found that Dab1 increased the expression of DCC both in the presence and absence of Siah. We hypothesized that Siah is expressed endogenously in 293T cells and causes degradation of DCC. This may explain the increased DCC expression induced by Dab1 in the absence of transfected Siah because tonic inhibition of DCC expression by endogenous Siah is blocked by Dab1. We then attempted to detect endogenous Siah. RT-PCR analysis revealed endogenous expression of Siah in 293T cells, but endogenous expression of Dab1 was not detected (Fig. 5B). As expected, endogenous expression of Siah was weaker than that observed in cells transfected with Siah cDNA.

Fig. 5. Effects of Dab1 on DCC expression (A) 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing DCC, EGFP-tagged Dab1, and flag epitope-tagged Siah-1A. After quantifying protein content using BCA assay, cell lysate was analyzed by SDS≠PAGE/immunoblotting with anti-DCC or anti-actin antibodies. Density of DCC bands was quantified and values are presented as bars. (B) RT-PCR analysis of 293T cells. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing EGFP-tagged Dab1, flag epitope-tagged Siah-1A, or myc epitopetagged Fyn. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and total RNA was prepared. Superscript reverse transcriptase II was used to make cDNAs from total RNA. PCR was carried out with primers as described in Materials and methods.

Transfected Dab1 and actin were detected, ruling out the possibility of wrong experimental conditions. However, Western blot analysis using cell lysate failed to detect endogenous Siah significantly and consistently (data not shown), which may be the result of rapid degradation of Siah and its substrates by the ubiquitin≠ proteasome pathway. This is supported by a previous report by Hu and Fearon [15] in which Siah expression upon transfection was visible only in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors in Western blot analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that Dab1-induced inhibition of endogenous Siah activity leads to an increase in DCC expression by Dab1 in the absence of transfected Siah.

Fig. 6. Effect of SiahDR on Dab1-induced increase of DCC expression. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing DCC, GFP-tagged Dab1, and flag epitope-tagged Siah-1A with or without a SiahDR expression vector. After quantifying protein content using BCA assay, cell lysate was analyzed by SDS≠PAGE/immunoblotting with anti-DCC antibody. Density of DCC bands was quantified and values are presented as bars.

SiahDR inhibits Dab1-induced increase in DCC expression Reports have suggested that the N-terminal RING domain of Siah is essential for the catalytic activity, while the C-terminal domain is involved in binding with substrates [18]. To confirm whether endogenous Siah is really involved in the Dab1-induced increase of DCC expression, we attempted to block the action of endogenous Siah. We cloned SiahDR, a C-terminal fragment of Siah (Fig. 2A), into a mammalian expression vector. Because SiahDR contains a Dab1-binding region and lacks the RING domain, it would bind with Dab1 but would not ubiquitinate DCC. Therefore, transfected SiahDR would compete with endogenous Siah in binding with Dab1, thus masking the effect of Dab1 on endogenous Siah. If this were the case, endogenous Siah that escaped from Dab1 inhibition would ubiquitinate and degrade DCC. Binding of SiahDR with Dab1 was confirmed in 293T cells using cotransfection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, the increase in DCC expression by Dab1 was significantly reduced when cells were cotransfected with SiahDR. However, decreased expression of DCC in the presence of cotransfected Siah was not significantly altered by the presence of SiahDR. These observations support that Dab1 increases expression of DCC by inhibiting the activity of endogenous Siah.

Discussion Our results clearly indicate that Dab1 regulates the activity of Siah. Interaction of Dab1 with Siah was first

identified by yeast two-hybrid screening. This interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in 293T cells as well as by in vitro binding experiments using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and in vitro translated proteins. While the expression level of Dab1 was not affected by Siah, steady-state Siah expression was increased by Dab1. This suggests that Dab1 is a regulator rather than a substrate of Siah. Because Siah can be auto-ubiquitinated [10], the increased expression of Siah can be attributed to the inhibition of Siah activity. Ubiquitination of Siah was inhibited by Dab1, which supports this hypothesis. Dab1 appears to inhibit the activity of Siah by direct protein≠protein interaction. Regulation of Siah by Dab1 is not only important but is also necessary because of the numerous biological roles that Siah plays through interaction with various other proteins (for review, see [19]). Siah is a murine homolog of Drosophila sina, which plays a critical role in R7 photoreceptor development by ubiquitinating the repressor of cell fate determination Tramtract [20,21]. To date, numerous Siah-interacting proteins have been reported and some are known to be substrates of Siah. DCC is one of its best-characterized substrates [13]. DCC was cloned as a candidate tumor suppressor [22] and later defined as the receptor for the axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 [23,24]. DCC has also been reported to induce apoptosis in the absence of its ligand [25]. Nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) [14] and kinesinlike DNA binding protein (Kid) [26] are also substrates of Siah, and are involved in derepression of nuclear hormone receptors and cell cycle regulation, respectively. Additionally, Siah was reported to degrade OBF-1/Bob1 coactivator, which is involved in octamerdependent transcriptional activity in B lymphocytes

[15,16]. Numb, a key determinant of cell fate in Drosophila development, was recently reported to be a substrate of Siah [17]. Another distinguishing feature of Siah is its involvement in apoptosis and tumor suppression. Siah expression increases under conditions of apoptosis and tumor suppression [9,27]. Siah can induce apoptosis and promote tumor suppression in a similar way to p53 and p21Waf1 [28] as well as induce growth arrest [29]. Siah has recently been implicated in p53-induced degradation of b-catenin by interacting with adenomatous polyposis coli and Siah-interacting protein [30,31]. These reports suggest that Siah plays critical roles in a variety of biological processes including axon guidance, apoptosis, the cell cycle, development, and tumor suppression through its interaction with various proteins. Therefore, regulation of Siah activity becomes a critical matter. To date, BAG-1, a ubiquitin-like Hsp70/Hsc70regulating protein, is the only known molecule that regulates the function of Siah [29]. By interacting with Siah, BAG-1 has been reported to inhibit Siah-induced growth arrest. Our results suggest that Dab1 is another important regulator of Siah. Dab1 is a well-known cytosolic adaptor protein that interacts with several important membrane proteins such as the ApoER2, the VLDLR, Notch, Alzheimer precursor protein (APP), APP-like proteins (APLPs), LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), and LDL receptor (reviewed in [7]). Through these interactions, Dab1 has been implicated in development, Alzheimer’s disease, and apoE signaling (reviewed in [8]). Based on our results, therefore, Dab1 likely mediates signals from membrane proteins to intracellular proteins by inhibiting Siah activity and increasing the concentration of Siah substrates. Because Dab1 interacts with various membrane proteins, and numerous proteins have been defined as substrates of Siah, Dab1-Siah interaction might act as a key bridge in connecting a variety of biological processes. Further studies defining the functional significance of Dab1-induced regulation of Siah activity will likely contribute to improved understanding of the role of the ubiquitin≠ proteasome pathway in biological phenomena. Regulation of Siah activity by Dab1 provides important clues in understanding the role of Dab1 in brain development. Previous studies about tissue distribution of Dab1 showed that expression primarily occurs in the brain [5,32], although Siah is found in a variety of tissues including brain, placenta, and testis [27,33,34]. Therefore, Dab1-Siah interaction is likely to occur mainly in the brain. Critical involvement of Dab1 in cortical development has been well established using Dab1-mutant mice such as yotari and scrambler, which showed a reeler-like phenotype [35,36]. According to the generally accepted model for reelin signaling in cortical development, reelin activates Dab1 by binding to ApoER2 and VLDLR [6,7]. On the other hand, the signal transduc-

tion pathway from Dab1 to downstream signaling molecules has not been clearly established. Our results suggest the possibility that Dab1 may exert its downstream signaling by regulating the activity of ubiquitin≠ proteasome system.
