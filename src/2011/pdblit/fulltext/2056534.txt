-Methylacyl-CoA racemases are essential enzymes for branched-chain fatty acid metabolism. Their reaction mechanism and the structural basis of their wide substrate specificity are poorly understood. High-resolution crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis -methylacyl-CoA racemase (MCR) complexed with substrate molecules show the active site geometry required for catalysis of the interconversion of (2S) and (2R)-methylacylCoA. The thioester oxygen atom and the 2-methyl group are in a cisconformation with respect to each other. The thioester oxygen atom fits into an oxyanion hole and the 2-methyl group points into a hydrophobic pocket. The active site geometry agrees with a 1,1-proton transfer mechanism in which the acid/base-pair residues are His126 and Asp156. The structures of the complexes indicate that the acyl chains of the S-substrate and the Rsubstrate bind in an S-pocket and an R-pocket, respectively. A unique feature of MCR is a large number of methionine residues in the acyl binding region, located between the S-pocket and the R-pocket. It appears that the (S) to (R) interconversion of the 2-methylacyl chiral center is coupled to a movement of the acyl group over this hydrophobic, methionine-rich surface, when moving from its S-pocket to its R-pocket, whereas the 2methyl moiety and the CoA group remain fixed in their respective pockets.

Introduction
In mammals, -methylacyl-CoA racemase (Amacr) plays an important role in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and in the degradation of branched-chain fatty acids, such as pristanic acid. The molecular and kinetic properties of rat1 and human Amacr2 have been studied, and it has been found that Amacr can interconvert the stereochemAbbreviations used: MCR, -methylacyl-CoA racemase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Amacr, -methylacyl-CoA racemase; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; r.m.s., root-mean-square; VOC, vicinal oxygen chelate; THCA, trihydroxycoprostanoic acid.

istry of the (2R) and (2S)-enantiomers of methylacyl-CoA of a wide range of substrates. In mammals, the physiological substrates are derived from: (i) C27-bile acid intermediates; or from (ii) branched-chain fatty acids, like pristanic acid (Figure 1). Pharmacologically, the enzyme is important for the biotransformation of 2-arylpropionic acid (Ibuprofen®, Figure 1), which is used as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.3 In the metabolism of the branched-chain fatty acids, this interconversion is of critical importance because of the unique (S)-substrate specificity of the branchedchain acyl-CoA oxidases. 4 In human patients, Amacr-deficiency results in adult-onset sensory motor neuropathy due to the accumulation of branched-chain fatty acids.5 One case of severe infantile-onset type liver dysfunction has been reported.6 In a knock-out mouse model, Amacr deficiency caused a strong reduction of mature bile

Reaction Mechanism of -Methyl-acyl-CoA Racemase

Figure 1. (a) The substrate molecules of mammalian Amacr. The covalent structures of pristanoyl-CoA, 3,7,12trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA and ibuprofenoyl-CoA are shown. The methyl group attached to the chiral C atom is referred to as the 2-methyl moiety. Amacr interconverts the chirality of this C atom. (b) The covalent structures of the substrate analogues acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA. The conformation of the acetoacetyl moiety shown at the left concerns the conformation that allows for internal hydrogen bonding. The rotamer at the right visualizes the observed mode of binding in the structure of the acetoacetyl-CoA MCR complex. (c) The reaction catalyzed by MCR. The catalytic interconversion of the two enantiomers takes place in the enzyme active site by a 1,1-proton transfer involving a catalytic acid/base-pair, which in MCR is His126 (base B1) and Asp156 (base B2). In the anionic intermediate, the C atom is planar and a negative charge develops on the thioester oxygen atom.

acids with concomitant increase of their C 27 precursors, without obvious phenotypic consequences.7 Supplementation of the diet with phytol, however, led to severe liver injury. The interest in Amacr increased when it was found that elevated Amacr catalytic activity is found in prostate cancer tissue, kidney tumors and colon carcinomas.8­10 Recently, the crystal structure of the homologue of Amacr of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (referred to as MCR) has been solved and refined at 1.8 Å resolution.11 MCR is highly homologous to human and rat Amacr (43% and 44% sequence identity, respectively). MCR has been shown to be an -methylacyl-CoA racemase and, conse-

quently, its structure provides important insight into the structural properties of mammalian Amacr. Like Amacr in mammals, MCR is of critical importance in the -oxidation of methyl branched fatty acids in Mycobacterium.12 The importance of this racemase activity for M. tuberculosis is emphasized by the observation that several homologues are present in this species.13,14 The structural data of MCR11 have shown that this enzyme belongs to the superfamily of type III CoA transferases.15 The structure of MCR is the only known structure of a CoA racemase of this new superfamily. The other members of this superfamily for which structural information is available are all

The subunit-2 loop, which connects its large domain to its small domain, provides residues of much importance for the binding pocket of the acyl moiety (Figure 2); this connecting loop follows after the kinked helix-8 (Figure 2) of the large domain. The corresponding loops of formyl-CoA transferase and carnitinyl-CoA transferase are of variable lengths,

enzymes with acyl-CoA transferase activity; in particular, formyl-CoA transferase16­19 and carnitinylCoA transferase.20,21 Enzymes of this superfamily are interlocked dimers. Each subunit is folded into a large domain and a small domain (Figure 2). The active site, near the N termini of helix-5 and helix-7, is formed essentially by residues of the large domain of subunit-1, but it is completed by residues of the small domain of subunit-2. This small domain of

Figure 2. (a) Stereo picture ("side" view) showing the interlocked dimer of MCR complexed with acetoacetyl-CoA. Two monomers, represented as a C ribbon are colored green (subunit-1) and orange (subunit-2). The stretch of residues (of subunit-1) that includes the active site helix-5 (with His126), helix-6 and helix-7 (with Asp156) is in cyan. Helix-5 and helix-6 protrude out of subunit-1. The methionine-rich stretch of residues (the acyl-binding loop region; residues 195­223) of subunit-2 is shown in magenta. This region connects the large domain and the small domain; the N-terminal part of this region (near Met198*) is the kinked helix-8. The only disordered region of the molecule that could not be built concerns residues 40­44, which follow after the second -strand of the large domain. Acetoacetyl-CoA is shown as a ball-and-stick model. The amino acid residues involved in the substrate binding and catalysis are shown. The amino acid residues and the bound ligand are colored according to atom type (C atoms are pink for MCR and grey for acetoacetyl-CoA). Two important active site water molecules (W1 and W2, present in all structures) are shown as red spheres.

Enzymes are usually classified as epimerases when the substrate molecule has several stereogenic centers, as in sugar molecules, whereas racemase substrates have only one chiral center, e.g. like amino acid racemases.22 All racemases and epimerases catalyze the interconversion of the (R) and (S) form of a chiral carbon. Many of these enzymes achieve this interconversion by deprotonation and reprotonation by a catalytic acid/base-pair, which is referred to also as a 1,1-proton transfer reaction, as reviewed recently.23 The best studied racemase is the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent alanine racemase in which the stereogenic center is activated by the formation of a Schiff base between the cofactor, PLP, and the amino group of the substrate.24­26 The 1,1-proton transfer is facilitated if the proton has a relatively low pKa, as in thioesters, which are known to have a pKa of approximately 20.27 MCR catalyzes such a thioester (CoA)-dependent racemization reaction via an acid/base mechanism that is independent of metal ions or other cofactors. A unique property of MCR is the relatively large size of two of the substituents (the CoA moiety and the acyl moiety) extending from the stereogenic center (Figure 1). Another noteworthy property of MCR is the large structural variability of the fatty acyl group, ranging from a modified benzene ring to a steroid moiety. Mutagenesis data of MCR have provided strong evidence that the acid/base-pair in the active site is a histidine/aspartate pair.11 None of the other studied racemases has such a catalytic pair. The catalytic aspartate residue of MCR (Asp156) corresponds to the catalytic aspartate residue of the acyl-CoA transferases of the same superfamily. As in the structures of the other superfamily members, this aspartate residue protrudes out of a central -helix. In MCR, its side-chain position is stabilized by interactions with an asparagine sidechain (Asn152) and a methionine side-chain (Met188). The reported MCR structure did not have a substrate or substrate analogue bound in the active site; nevertheless, by combining the structure with kinetic data from mutated variants it could be predicted that the second catalytic residue is His126.11 From the structure, it was seen that this histidine residue is hydrogen bonded to Glu241 (of the small domain of the other subunit) and the mutational analysis also confirmed the crucial role of this glutamate residue for catalysis. The catalytic His126 is at the N terminus of helix-5, which together with helix6 protrudes out of the large domain of subunit-1. After this protrusion, the polypeptide continues into the active site helix-7 (Figure 2), which has the catalytic Asp156 at its N terminus. Here, we report on the structures of five MCR ligand complexes, confirming the catalytic role of His126 and Asp156, and providing much new insight into the reaction mechanism and the substrate specificity of MCR.

Reaction Mechanism of -Methyl-acyl-CoA Racemase

Results
The structures of the five complexes of MCR with acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, (R,S)-ibuprofenoylCoA, (2S)-methylmyristoyl-CoA, and (2R)-methylmyristoyl-CoA have been refined at high resolution with good geometry and low R-factors (Table 1). The enzyme kinetic studies show that the latter three compounds (which have the 2-methyl moiety), have high affinity for MCR, whereas acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA have much lower affinity (Table 2). The initial soaking experiments were done with substrate analogues lacking the 2-methyl group (CoA, acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA). The experiments with CoA did not show any binding, whereas acetyl-CoA, and acetoacetyl-CoA were bound. For acetyl-CoA the thioester oxygen atom is involved in an indirect, water-mediated, hydrogen bond to N (Asp127), whereas acetoacetyl-CoA binds with its thioester oxygen hydrogen bonded directly to N (Asp127) (Figure 2). Binding studies with extended 2-methylacyl-CoA molecules always cracked the crystals immediately. However, a mild cross-linking protocol with glutaraldehyde prevented this crystal cracking. These 2-methyl acyl-CoA molecules also bind with their thioester oxygen atom hydrogen bonded to N(Asp127), as shown in Figure 3 for ibuprofenoyl-CoA. No structural difference was seen in the protein part when comparing the structures of the crosslinked crystals and the crystals that are not crosslinked. A superposition analysis shows that the 61 core C atoms of the large domain can be superimposed with an r.m.s. fit value of approximately 0.2 Å, whereas the C atoms of the small domain superimpose with an r.m.s. fit value of 0.3 Å after applying only a small additional rotation (approximately 2°). The electron density maps of the crosslinked crystals do not show evidence for a wellordered cross-linking glutaraldehyde molecule, indicating that the cross-linking has happened in a random fashion, without a specific preference for a particular crystal contact site. The extended binding groove The mode of binding of acetoacetyl-CoA (Figure 2) confirms that the catalytic site is a deep pocket in the center of a large groove. This extended groove provides the binding site for the CoA molecule on one side of the catalytic center, and the binding pocket for the acyl moiety, on the other side. The CoA and acyl-binding pockets point in opposite directions, away from the catalytic center. The adenine has a stacking interaction with the sidechain of Arg38 and is pointing with its NH2 group towards the bulk of the protein, being hydrogen bonded to O(Ala59). The 3-phosphate moiety points into bulk solvent and is salt-bridged to Lys62 and Arg91. A further salt-bridge interaction is seen between Arg85 and the pyrophosphate moiety (Figure 2). The thioester moiety is bound in the center of the extended binding groove, such that

the sulfur atom of the CoA moiety is covered by the side-chain of Ile16. The CoA-binding pocket is formed exclusively by subunit-1 residues of the large domain. The acetoacetyl moiety is almost planar and points to the acyl-binding pocket. Its binding pocket is formed by subunit-1 residues of the large domain, as well as by the subunit-2 residues that connect the large domain of subunit2 with its small domain. The residues of this small domain complete the acyl-binding pocket (Figure 2). The -acetyl group of the acetoacetyl moiety is rotated away from the bulk of the protein, such that internal hydrogen bonding between its two

oxygen atoms (as observed in some other acetoacetyl-CoA enzyme complexes (Figure 1)) is not possible. In the visualized mode of binding, its terminal methyl group contacts the side-chain of Ile16 (Figures 2 and 3). The mode of binding of (S) and (R )-ibuprofenoyl-CoA in the active site The structure of the ligand-bound complex of MCR obtained from soaking enzyme crystals with (R, S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA has been refined at 1.85 Å resolution.

shows the mode of binding of an (S)-ibuprofenoylCoA molecule. The chiral C  atom is tightly anchored between ND1(His126) (at 3.3 Å) and OD2(Asp156) (at 3.7 Å) (Figure 4). The thioester oxygen atom and the 2-methyl group of ibuprofenoyl-CoA are in a cis-conformation with respect to each other, and both point inwards, towards the bottom of the catalytic pocket (Figure 3). The thioester oxygen atom is hydrogen bonded to N (Asp127) (3.0 Å); it is also in close contact with ND1 (His126) (3.3 Å), OD1(Asp156) (3.1 Å) and OD2 (Asp156) (2.9 Å). The 2-methyl group contacts sidechain atoms of His126, Asp127, Asn152, and Asp156 of the large subunit, and of Leu217*, Tyr224*, and Ile240* of the small domain of the other subunit (Figure 3). Central in the catalytic site are the polar sidechains of Asp127, Asn152 and Asp156 (Figure 4). Each of these side-chains is well anchored by interactions with neighboring atoms: the position of the Asp156 side-chain is anchored by the interactions with the sulfur atom of Met188 (at the N terminus of the kinked helix-8) and the ND2group of Asn152 (at the N terminus of helix-7). The Asn152 side-chain is anchored subsequently to SD (Met198*) (of the kinked helix-8 of the other subunit)

and to N(Asn152). The latter interaction identifies the orientation of the Asn152 side-chain, such that ND2(Asn152) points to OD2(Asp156). On the other side of the binding cleft is the second catalytic residue, His126 (Figure 3). This side-chain is hydrogen bonded to Glu241* (of the small domain of the second subunit). His126 is at the N terminus of helix-5. This helix has an Ncapping hydrogen bond between N(Ile128) and OH (Tyr224*) (Figures 4 and 5). Asp127A is a prominent residue in the active site and is located at the bottom of the catalytic site. The side-chain oxygen atoms of Asp127 are well hydrogen bonded. OD1(Asp127) is hydrogen bonded to OH(Tyr224*) via Wat1 and to main chain atoms O (Leu151) (via Wat2), N(Leu153) (via Wat2) and N (Val154) (via Wat2). OD2(Asp127) is hydrogen bonded to N(Gly155) and N(Asp156). Wat1 and Wat2 are well defined in each active site of the unliganded and liganded structures. These water molecules have hydrogen bonding interactions with the main-chain atoms of residues Leu151, Leu153, Val154, and Gly155 (Figure 4). Residues 153­155 are in the first turn of helix-7 and have adopted a -helix conformation. This -helix, which is preceded by residues Pro149-Pro150-Leu151, starts at residue Asn152. O(Asn152) is hydrogen bonded to N(Phe157). The last -helix hydrogen bond is between O(Phe157) and N(Met162). Residues Gly158Gly159-Gly160 have adopted conformations such that the -helix continues as a normal -helix after Gly160. The main chain oxygen atoms of Gly158 and Gly159 point away from the helix axis, whereas O (Gly160) is hydrogen bonded to N(Leu164). The catalytic residue Asp156 is protruding out of the much wider turn of the -helix, positioning it further away from the helical axis, such as to generate the correct active site geometry for optimal catalytic

Two important water molecules (W1 and W2) in the active site are shown as red spheres. The side-chains of His126, Asp127, Asn152, and Asp156 of the large domain of subunit-1, and Leu217*, Tyr224*, and Ile240* of the small domain of subunit-2 make the binding pocket for the 2-methyl group.

efficiency. The NH-peptide groups of the four Nterminal residues of this -helix (residues 153 till 156, Figure 4) are all involved in the active site hydrogen bonding network. The difference map calculated after completion of the refinement with only an (S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA molecule in each active site clearly shows additional density near the (S)-ibuprofen moiety. This residual density can be modeled as the acyl moiety of an (R)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA molecule (Figure 5). The refinement of the (R) and (S) enantiomers simultaneously, with both occupancies set to 0.5, provides insight into their different geometries and protein contacts. The change can be described as the -proton and the acyl group trading places, accompanied by small adjustments (approximately 1 Å) of the atoms of the chiral center (Figure 5). In the complex with the (S)-compound, the proton on the C atom points to ND1(His126), and in the (R)-compound complex this proton points to OD2 (Asp156) (Figure 5). This geometry indicates that the histidine residue is the base for abstracting the C proton from the (S)-enantiomer, whereas the aspartate residue is the base for abstracting the C proton from the (R)-compound. In both complexes, the thioester oxygen atom is well hydrogen bonded to N(Asp127) with contact distances of 3.0 Å and 2.9 Å for the (S) and (R)-enantiomer, respectively.

The binding pocket for the acyl moieties of (S) and (R)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA The phenyl ring of the (S)-enantiomer of ibuprofenoyl-CoA binds between the side-chains of Ile16, Pro20, Met50 and Met198* (of the other subunit) (Figure 5). The benzene ring points in the same direction as the -acetyl group of the acetoacetyl moiety of the acetoacetyl-CoA complex (Figure 3). The side-chains of Ile16 and Met50 adopt slightly different conformations in the presence of the bound ligand. The (R)-enantiomer binds with its benzene ring near the side-chains of Met216*, Leu217*, and Ile240* of the other subunit. The side-chains of Met50, Met198*, Met199*, Met202*, Met207*, Trp208*, form a large hydrophobic surface over which the benzene ring slides when switching from the S mode of binding (near Ile16 of the large domain of subunit-1) to the R mode of binding (near Ile240* of the small domain of subunit-2). The stretch of residues (195­223) will be referred to as the acyl-binding loop region. It is a smooth surface, enriched in methionine side-chains (Figure 6). The shape of the S-pocket (near Ile16) is determined mostly by side-chains of the large domain of subunit-1, whereas the shape of the R-pocket (near Ile240*) depends also on the relative position of the small domain (of subunit-2) with respect to the large

can also, in a subtle way, influence indirectly the precise properties of active sites that are related by non-crystallographic symmetry, as has been shown in studies of other crystalline enzymes.28,29

Discussion
The binding pocket for the 2-methyl group The structures of five different MCR complexes are reported. The structures in which the ligand has the 2-methyl group as well as an extended acyl moiety could be obtained only after stabilizing the crystals by a mild cross-linking procedure. It is seen that the cross-linking does not affect the mode of binding of the acyl-CoA molecule, as shown for the comparison of the structures of ibuprofenoyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA (Figure 3). Therefore, the observed mode of binding of ibuprofenoyl-CoA, and (S) and (R)-2methylmyristoyl-CoA unequivocally show the binding pocket of the 2-methyl group. The C atom of the fatty acyl moiety is covalently bonded to (i) the C hydrogen atom, (ii) the 2methyl group, (iii) the thioester-CoA moiety, and (iv) the C atom of the acyl group. Inversion of the chirality of the C atom does not cause any change in the mode of binding of the thioester-CoA moiety. The 2-methyl group moves slightly, but remains bound in the same pocket, which is shaped by residues of the large domain and the small domain (of the other subunit). This pocket apparently is just large enough for a methyl group; in any case it is not used for binding the extra acetyl-group of acetoacetyl-CoA (Figures 2 and 3). Kinetic studies have indicated that the 2-methyl group provides important contributions to the affinity, as it has been found, for example, for the rat and human homologue, that the unbranched acyl-CoA has just weak affinity, whereas 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA binds tightly.1,2 The inversion of the chirality is caused by the interchange of the positions of the C hydrogen atom and the C atom. Soaking experiments with the 2-methylacyl-CoA molecules using either the (R) or the (S)-enantiomer always resulted in severe crystal cracking when using the uncrosslinked crystals. The 2-methylacyl moieties are more extended than acetoacetyl-CoA, and clashes of these more extended moieties with neighboring molecules could explain the crystal cracking. Additionally, the binding of the 2-methyl group in its binding pocket between the large and the small domain could induce a positional change of the small domain with respect to the large domain when using crystals that are not cross-linked. The acyl moiety is bound to a hydrophobic, methionine-rich surface In each complex, the acyl moiety is always bound to the methionine-rich surface (Figures 6 and 8), created by the acyl-binding loop region, residues

Release of 3H from [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA by purified MCR was measured at substrate concentrations of 40 M (,) and 60 M (, ), in the presence of the indicated concentrations of (a) racemic ( ,) and (2S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA (,) or (b) (2R)- ( , ) and (2S)-methylmyristoyl-CoA (,), as described in Materials and Methods.





The crystallographic binding experiments with 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA show that the CoA moiety, the thioester oxygen atom and the 2-methyl group of 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA are bound in the same way as seen for ibuprofenoyl-CoA. The acyl chain of the (S)-enantiomer is bound with highest occupancy in the B active site and its -end contacts Met198*, Met202* and Met207* of the S-pocket (Figure 8). The acyl chain of the (R)-compound is bound differently, indicating that the cross-linked, crystalline enzyme is not interconverting the R and S forms of 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA. The acyl chain of the (R)-compound is bound in the R-pocket, near Met216*, Leu217* and Ile240*. The full-length alkyl chain of the (R)-compound is seen in the B and D active sites. In the B active site, the -end of the alkyl chain appears to adopt two conformations after the C5 atom (Figure 8). These small differences in modes of binding of the alkyl chain of the (R)-compound in the different active sites can be understood from crystal packing effects. Crystal contact analysis shows that the hydrophobic, methionine-rich surface, important for the interactions with the acyl moieties of each of the extended ligands, is indeed involved directly in crystal contacts in all four active sites of the asymmetric unit.

195­223 of the other subunit. The observed mode of binding varies for the different ligands; it is determined by the nature of the acyl group and by the chirality of the stereogenic center. The acyl substituent of the (S)-enantiomer of ibuprofenoylCoA and 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA binds to the smooth surface in the region near Ile16, Pro20 and Met198* (the S-pocket). The acyl substituent of the (R)-enantiomer of ibuprofenoyl-CoA and 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA binds to the smooth surface near Ile240* and Met216* (the R-pocket). The range of experimentally observed positions of the acyl group as well as the very tight geometry near the catalytic center suggests that the catalysis of the 1,1-proton transfer is coupled to a movement of the acyl moiety over this hydrophobic surface. The importance of such a motion of a bulky hydrophobic group extending out of the chiral center has been discussed recently for mandelate racemase, where, on the basis of mutagenesis data and MD calculations, it was proposed that its phenyl moiety moves over a hydrophobic surface from its S-pocket to its R-

pocket during catalysis, whereas its -hydroxyl group and its -carboxylate group remain anchored in their respective pockets.30 The reaction mechanism The five liganded structures of MCR provide a detailed picture of its active site geometry. These studies identify the binding pocket of the 2-methyl group as well as the location of the extended acyl moiety, and they confirm the importance of His126 and Asp156 for the catalysis. This is in good agreement with the previous mutagenesis data showing very low turnover numbers for the H126A and D156A variants.11 The protonation state of these active site side-chains and water molecules cannot be determined from the structural data obtained from the X-ray diffraction experiments. These protonation states are nevertheless essential for discussion of the mechanism.31­33 The pH optimum of Amacr is near pH 7, suggesting that the pKa of the His126 and Asp156 side-chains could be approximately 7. A pKa

1156 of approximately 7 for His126 is quite common for a histidine side-chain, in particular as this histidine side-chain is part of a catalytic dyad with a glutamic acid residue (Glu241*) as has been seen in other active sites.34 The pKa of Asp156 will be influenced by the directly contacting side-chains, being Met188 and Asn152, as well as by the other active site components; in particular, the side-chain of Asp127. The side-chain of Asp127 is not directly hydrogen bonded to the side-chain of Asp156 (the shortest distance, between OD2(Asp127) and OD2(Asp156), is 4.5 Å); nevertheless, the pKa of Asp127 will be important for the mechanism. This side-chain points to the N-terminal end of helix-7; it is well hydrogen bonded to the free NH-peptide groups of this helix, as well as to the two active site water molecules (Figures 4 and 5). This polar environment suggests that the pKa will be close to its bulk solvent value and, consequently, it is predicted that this side-chain is charged at pH 7. This charge can be distributed over the two water molecules (W1 and W2), which interact with the Asp127 side-chain via hydrogen bonding interactions (Figure 4). The presence of a negative charge on the Asp127 side-chain will raise the pKa of the nearby Asp156, which is anchored between SD(Met188) and ND2(Asn152). The geometry near the Asp156 carboxylate group suggests that OD1 is unprotonated and OD2 is involved in the proton exchange with the substrate. To some extent, the protonated OD2 atom can be involved in the stabilization of the thioester oxygen anion when it is transiently formed in the catalytic cycle. These predictions are based on the following observations. (i) The geometric arrangement of SD(Met188) and OD1(Asp156) suggests that this carboxylate oxygen atom is a nucleophilic partner for this interaction (and not involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction).35,36 (ii) The OD2 atom is well placed for abstraction and donation of a proton to the C carbon atom of the substrate. (iii) The OD2(Asp156) atom accepts a hydrogen bond interaction from ND2 (Asn152), such that the exchangeable proton of OD2 (Asp156) can interact with the C atom of the substrate. (iv) The key residues predicted to be important in the reaction mechanism (His127, Asp156, Met188, Glu241, Asn152) are also conserved in the rat, mouse and human Amacr homologues. From this analysis, it is suggested that the acidic form of Asp156 is neutral, and the basic form is negatively charged. The following scheme (Figure 9) for the reaction cycle emerges from these studies. The (S)-enantiomer will be converted into the (R)-enantiomer on binding to an active site with a neutral His126 sidechain and a protonated, neutral Asp156. The competent active site for conversion of the (R)enantiomer into the (S)-enantiomer will be the protonated, positively charged His126 and the deprotonated, negatively charged Asp156. In each case, at the end of the reaction cycle after the product has dissociated away from the active site, the protonation state of the active site will be regenerated, either by exchange of protons with the bulk

Reaction Mechanism of -Methyl-acyl-CoA Racemase

solvent, or by direct proton transfer between His126 and Asp156. The abstraction of the proton from the C atom is facilitated by the presence of an oxyanion hole, formed by N(Asp127). This oxyanion hole stabilizes the transiently formed negative charge on the thioester oxygen atom, which is formed after the C proton has been abstracted by His126 (from the (S)-compound) or Asp156 (from the (R)-compound). This thioester oxyanion of the planar intermediate is further stabilized by the protonated side-chains of His126 and Asp156 (Figure 9). The formation of this planar intermediate is facilitated also by the mode of binding of the substrate, as the 2-methyl group is seen to be bound already in a cis-conformation with respect to the thioester oxygen atom. Such a conformation favors proton abstraction of the C proton because of the alignment of the C-H -bond with the -system of the thioester moiety,37 and is seen also in the complexed active site of diaminopimelate racemase.38 Comparison with other racemases The only other known structure of a CoA-dependent racemase is 2-methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase 22, 39 of the vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) superfamily, which has a completely different fold. This racemase also catalyzes the racemization at the -position of the thioester (2-methylmalonyl-CoA), but via a different, Co 2+ -dependent, reaction mechanism. The structure of the (unliganded) active site suggests that the catalytic acid/base-pair is a glutamate/glutamate couple. Other well-studied, metal-dependent racemases are, for example, the Mg2+-dependent mandelate racemase,40,30 in which the acid/base-pair is a histidine/lysine couple, the Mg2+ -dependent L-Ala-D,L-Glu-dipeptide epimerase41 with a lysine/lysine couple in the active site, and the Zn 2+ -dependent D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase,42­45 in which the acid/basepair is an aspartate/aspartate couple. All other cofactor or metal ion-independent racemases belong to a class of enzymes that interconvert L and Damino acids. The best studied examples of this class of enzymes are proline racemase, aspartate racemase, glutamate racemase, and diaminopimelate racemase.23 Each of these enzymes has as the catalytic acid/base-pair a cysteine/cysteine couple in the active site. In the MCR complexes, the distance between the acid/base moieties is short (6.1 Å) such that the reactive carbon atom just fits in between these acid/ base partners. Such a short distance (6.3 Å) between the two catalytic aspartate residues is found also in the unliganded D-ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase.42­45 In other acid/base racemases the catalytic site is less tight. For example, in the enzyme ligand complexes of the Mg2+-dependent mandelate racemase and L-Ala-D,L-Glu epimerase the distance between the acid/base-pair atoms is 8.5 Å and 7.0 Å, respectively. In the cofactor and metal ion-independent glutamate racemase, proline racemase and diaminopimelate racemase, the distance between the

The reaction mechanism of the interconversion of (2S)-methylacyl-CoA to (2R)-methylacyl-CoA by MCR, as suggested from the crystal structure and kinetic data. In this enzymatic conversion, His126 acts as a general base (abstracting a proton from the -carbon atom of the (S)-compound) and Asp156 acts as a general acid (donating a proton to the -carbon atom of the (S)-compound). Dotted lines highlight important stabilizing interactions. The oxyanion of the reaction intermediate is stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions with the main-chain NH group of Asp127, as well as with the protonated side-chains of His126 and Asp156.

1158 two catalytic sulfur atoms is approximately 7.5 Å,46 6.9 Å,47 and 6.7 Å38 in the structures of the respective enzyme­ligand complexes. Given the larger van der Waals radius of a sulfur atom, this geometry is also very tight. In glutamate racemase,46,48 as well as proline racemase, 47 and diaminopimelate racemase,38 substantial domain rearrangements occur on ligand binding. It is not clear if domain movements are a feature of the MCR reaction cycle. Concluding remarks The structures of the MCR complexes provide unique geometric data on the mode of binding of both the (R) and the (S) compound, which are typically not available from structural studies of other racemases and epimerases. The structures of these complexes suggest that the CoA moiety remains rigidly bound during the catalytic cycle, when the substrate is converted into product. The inversion of the chirality of the C atom is achieved principally by exchanging the position of the C proton and the acyl moiety. Both for ibuprofenoylCoA and for 2-methylmyristoyl-CoA, the fatty acyl tail is seen to adopt different conformations for the (S) and the (R)-enantiomer. These different binding modes suggest that the interconversion of the 2-(S) and 2-(R)-methyl enantiomers is coupled to a movement of the acyl moiety over the hydrophobic methionine-rich surface that connects the S-pocket and the R-pocket. This hydrophobic surface is conserved in the homologous mammalian racemases, which are known to have a wide range of substrate specificities, including the interconversion of bile acid intermediates, like trihydroxycoprostanoic acid (THCA) (Figure 1). Studies in human cell cultures49 as well as in Amacr knock-out mice7 have shown that -methylacyl-CoA racemase acitvity is indeed required for complete processing of bile acid intermediates. However, the C27 bile acid precursors accumulating in knock-out mice apparently substitute largely for the mature C24 bile acids. Also, reptiles and amphibia possess only C27 bile acids.50 The symptoms in human Amacr-deficient patients as well as in knock-out mice seem to be caused mainly by the accumulation of branched-chain fatty acids.5,7 The bacterial racemase, MCR, also has a high affinity for bile acid intermediates (Table 2), although mycobacteria do not have any bile acid metabolism. Together, these observations suggest that -methylacyl-CoA racemases were initially needed to recruit the entirely (S)-specific acyl-CoA oxidases and dehydrogenases4 for the degradation of methyl-branched fatty acids originating from isoprenoids. Their substrate promiscuity51 then permitted the peroxisomal -oxidation system to act also on bile acid precursors, leading to the generation of C24 bile acids as an additional bonus. It seems likely that the steroid moiety of the bile acid intermediates binds to the extended, conserved hydrophobic surface, which apparently is a principal component of the primary functionality of this enzyme.

Material and Methods
Protein expression, purification, crystallization and initial structure determinations Wild-type MCR was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described.11,13 Crystals of wild-type MCR were grown in the same condition as described before.11 Well diffracting crystals of the wild-type MCR were grown at 22 °C by the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method (reservoir 1.52 M ammonium phosphate, 10 mM BaCl2 at pH 7.0) in 6 l drops containing a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of reservoir and protein solution (6 mg/ml in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.8). In this crystal form, the space group is C2 with two dimers per asymmetric unit; active sites A and B belong to the AB-dimer and active sites C and D make the CD-dimer. All the datasets were processed using the program packages XDS52 and CCP4.53 The data collection statistics are presented in Table 1. The structures of the complexes were determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP,54 and using a dimer of the wild-type MCR structure (PDB access code 1X74) as the search model. In all the binding studies, the difference electron density maps clearly defined the mode of binding of the CoA part of the ligand in each active site. The structures were refined via iterative cycles of model refinement with REFMAC555 and model building in electron density maps using O.56 Kinetic assays The enzymatic activity of MCR was measured as release of 3 H from [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA as described before.1 The binding affinities of other -methylacyl-CoAs were determined by a competitive inhibition assay: with (R, S)ibuprofenoyl-CoA, (S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, (2R)-methylmyristoyl-CoA and (2S)-methylmyristoyl-CoA, respectively, as inhibitors, 5 ng of purified MCR was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 l of a solution containing 20 M, 40 M or 60 M [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA (6.45 Ci/mol) and 0, 10 M, 20 M, 40 M, 60 M, 80 M, 100 M, 200 M or 400 M inhibitor in 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0) with 0.2% octyl--D-glucopyranoside. With (25-R,S)-THCA-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA as inhibitors, 10 ng MCR was incubated with 20 M [2-3H]pristanoyl-CoA and 0, 6.25 M, 12.5 M or 25 M inhibitor under otherwise identical conditions. Determination of the structures of the complexes of acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA MCR crystals were soaked for 1 h in 2 mM acetyl-CoA and 2 mM acetoacetyl-CoA solution (prepared in mother liquor), respectively. Then the crystals were transferred from the soaking drop to the cryoprotectant solution (mother liquor containing also 24% (v/v) glycerol and 2 mM compound (acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, respectively) using nylon loops and immediately flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K just before data collection. The data from the acetyl-CoA soaked crystal were collected using the home X-ray source, equipped with a MAR345 image plate. The dataset from the acetoacetyl-CoA soaked crystal were collected using synchrotron radiation (Max-Lab, Sweden). The structure of MCR complexed with acetyl-CoA was refined at 2.3 Å resolution. In the active sites of subunits A, B, and D, the

Reaction Mechanism of -Methyl-acyl-CoA Racemase acetyl moiety is well defined, but in the C active site it is disordered because of the presence of a glycerol molecule. The structure of MCR complexed with acetoacetyl-CoA was refined at 1.7 Å resolution. The acetoacetyl moiety is well defined in the A and D active sites, but in the B and C active sites it is disordered because of the presence of a glycerol molecule. The final refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Determination of the structures of the complexes of (R, S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, (2S)-methylmyristoyl-CoA and (2R )-methylmyristoyl-CoA Routine soaking experiments of the MCR crystals using a mother liquor supplemented with (R, S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, (2R)-methylmyristoyl-CoA and (2S)-methylmyristoyl-CoA, respectively, caused these crystals to crack immediately. Different substrate concentrations and various soaking protocols were tried, but none could prevent the cracking of the MCR crystals. Also, co-crystallization experiments failed to produce crystals. Eventually, successful soaking experiments were done using glutaraldehyde cross-linked MCR crystals:57 1 l of 25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution was added to the 6 l crystallization drop containing the protein crystals. The drop was mixed slowly using the crystal mounting loop, and the crystal in the drop was allowed to cross-link for 30 s. Subsequently, the crystal was transferred to a fresh drop of mother liquor supplemented with the appropriate substrate. Three different cross-linked MCR crystals were soaked separately in 2 mM (R, S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, (2S)-methylmyristoyl-CoA and (2R)-methylmyristoyl-CoA for 2 h, 24 h and 22 h, respectively. After soaking, the crystals were transferred briefly (approximately 30 s) to the cryoprotectant solution (1.52 M ammonium phosphate, 24% glycerol, and 2 mM corresponding ligand) before flash-freezing in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K for immediate data collection. The 1.85 Å dataset from the (R, S)-ibuprofenoylCoA soaked MCR crystal was collected using a home X-ray source. The datasets of MCR crystals soaked with the (2S)methylmyristoyl-CoA (1.7 Å) and (2R)-methylmyristoylCoA (1.6 Å) were collected using synchrotron radiation (Max-Lab, Sweden) (Table 1). The final refinement statistics of these three complexes are presented in Table 1. Structure analysis The structures have been analyzed with the programs PROCHECK58 and O.56 Structure superpositions have been done with the LSQ option of O, using corresponding C atoms. For the superpositions, the 61 C atoms of the core of the large subunit were used, being residues 9­14, 19­30, 32­37, 54­59, 78­82, 107­112, 160­173, 181­186). For the additional small domain superpositions, the C atoms of residues 224­300 were used. The Figures were made with PYMOL. Figure 6(c) was made with ICM.
