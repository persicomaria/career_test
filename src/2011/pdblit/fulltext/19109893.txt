Abstract A group of recent publications contribute new insights concerning the role of the DNA damage-binding protein complex (DDB) in DNA repair. Mutations in the 48 kDa DDB2 subunit are now found in all confirmed cases of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group E. Several studies have reported a connection between the 127 kDa DDB1 subunit and proteins involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. One such multiprotein complex containing DDB1 and DDB2 is closely related to a complex containing DDB1 and the Cockayne syndrome group A (CSA) protein. There is accumulating evidence for several levels of cellular regulation of DDB, including translocation to the nucleus, proteolytic degradation of DDB2 protein, and transcriptional induction of DDB2 mRNA. Although the mechanism is not yet known, it appears that DDB assists in nucleotide excision repair in chromatin. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In 1946, the great tenor saxophonist Lester Young wrote and recorded his "DB blues", expressing his sentiments about being unfairly confined to detention barracks in the closing months of the Second World War. In retrospect, "Damage Binding" would have been another legitimate interpretation of the song title, as the cruel incident permanently fixed itself to Young's spirit and accelerated his decline. Recent research on a protein complex called DDB is revealing its association with a new set of polypeptides, its brotherhood with a complex containing the CSA protein involved in Cockayne syndrome and the involvement of both complexes in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. A picture of surprisingly complex multi-level regulation of the non-essential DDB activity is also emerging. The DNA damage-binding complex DDB: DNA damage-binding (DDB) protein, sometimes referred to as UV-DDB, is a heterodimer comprised of the 127 kDa DDB1 subunit and the 48 kDa DDB2 subunit. The DDB complex binds tightly to UV-irradiated DNA (for a recent review, see [1]). The high affinity

of DDB for irradiated DNA is illustrated by the fact that it is the only such factor that can be detected in crude mammalian cell extracts by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay or by a filter-binding assay. DDB activity has been repeatedly discovered in this way, first by Feldberg and Grossman [2]. In 1988, Chu and Chang reported that two human xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) group E cell lines tested (now known as the prototype XP-E cells XP2RO and XP3RO) lacked this nuclear factor that binds damaged DNA [3]. However, the picture was complicated by the observation that several other cell lines, assigned at the time to the XP-E group, retained DDB activity as measured by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. These were designated as "DDB+ " XP-E cells [4,5]. The DDB complex proved to be the factor defective in the XP-E cells that lack DDB, as microinjection of it into nuclei of such cells restored their nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity [6]. DDB1 from simian cells was the first DDB gene to be isolated [7]. The

DDB2 subunit escaped the attention of investigators for several years, possibly because it stains relatively poorly with Coomassie blue. The genes encoding both subunits of human DDB were subsequently isolated [8,9]. Soon after, DNA sequencing from Linn's laboratory unveiled the fact that DDB2 is mutated in XP-E cells that lack DDB activity, while DDB2 in DDB+ cells is not mutated [10]. Mutations in DDB2 are responsible for XP group E: The apparent heterogeneity in the XP-E group has remained an unsolved problem until recently. Itoh et al. [11] reclassified three such DDB+ cell lines, finding that their complementation groups had been originally misassigned and were in fact examples of XP-V, XP-F, and UV-sensitive syndrome, respectively. Furthermore, in a thorough recent study [12], four other DDB+ cell lines originally thought to be XP-E were reassigned to groups XP-F, XP-V, and to UV-sensitive syndrome. Consequently, it now appears that all known genuine examples of XP complementation group E are caused by mutation of the DDB2 subunit. Currently, there are eight confirmed XP-E individuals, and the precise sites of mutation in DDB2 are known for them all [12]. Individuals with XP-E have xeroderma pigmentosum, though rather mild, with affected patients surviving longer than those from other groups. Cells from these individuals show moderate UV-sensitivity, with NER levels reduced to 50­80% of normal as measured by "unscheduled DNA synthesis" (UDS) [6,13]. Specifically, XP-E cells have a reduced capacity to remove a major UV-induced photoproduct, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) from non-transcribed DNA [14]. Interestingly, DDB2 expression is suppressed by cytosine methylation in many rodent cell lines. Rodent cells, as well as XP-E cells, show poor removal of CPDs from DNA. This repair defect can be restored by reactivating DDB2 gene expression, or by exogenous expression of DDB2 in the cell lines [15,16]. DDB has a strong discrimination for binding to DNA damage, including UV-induced CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts [17­20]. However, in vitro reconstitution of nucleotide excision repair can be accomplished on damaged naked DNA in the absence of DDB protein [21,22]. These considerations have led to the suggestion that DDB has a specialized role in recognition of DNA damage in chromatin, perhaps

helping the NER complex to gain access to the DNA lesions [1,23,24]. Complex regulation: It has become apparent that after a cell is exposed to UV-irradiation, DDB is regulated at several levels. Relatively soon after UV-irradiation, DDB becomes tightly bound to chromatin. In non-irradiated cells most DDB can be extracted with a low salt buffer. Following UV-irradiation, most DDB is found tightly bound to DNA [25] and can only be extracted from the chromatin fraction by treatment with DNAse [23]. In another level of control, DDB1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after UV-irradiation [23,26­28]. Further, DDB2 mRNA is increased several fold following irradiation, reaching its maximum level 48 h after cells are exposed to UV. The significance of this induction, if any, is not yet known. In human cells, the majority of UV-induced photoproducts in DNA are repaired before this time [29]. Most intriguingly, the DDB2 protein is rapidly degraded after irradiation, but later reaches a level higher than that of non-irradiated cells. Although the purpose and function of this regulation has not been determined, it is clear that it takes place through a process that is subject to inhibition by chemical inhibitors of the proteosome [27], indicating a mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Consistent with that notion, a specific association of DDB2 with cullin 4A (Pcu4), a component of E3 ubiquitin ligases, has been found [28,30,31]. In summary, after DNA is damaged by UVirradiation of cells, DDB binds tightly to damaged chromatin. Some DDB1 is translocated to the nucleus. Within 4 h of irradiation, a fraction (60%) of the chromatin-bound DDB2 is degraded. After 48 h, DDB2 mRNA levels increase several fold above the level in non-irradiated cells [27,32]. Complex complexes: In a recent study, Groisman et al. [33] took a new approach to the study of DDB, purifying DDB2 and associated proteins from HeLa cells by virtue of HA and FLAG epitope tags on DDB2. After sequential immunoprecipitation using anti-HA and anti-FLAG reagents and glycerol gradient separation, gel electrophoresis revealed a set of about a dozen polypeptides that were associated relatively tightly with DDB2. These polypeptides were then identified by mass spectrometry and by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. In parallel,

cells carrying a tag on the Cockayne syndrome group A (CSA) protein were generated and a CSA protein complex isolated by the same methods. Remarkably, the DDB2 and CSA complexes are apparently identical in protein composition--except for the exclusive presence of either DDB2 or CSA. In particular, DDB1 was present in both complexes. In fact, as has been noted previously [15,34], the amino acid sequences of DDB2 and CSA share sequence similarity in a central region that includes WD40 repeats. The DDB2 and CSA complexes are functionally active. Microinjection of the DDB2 complex into XP-E cells restored their UDS activity to normal, while microinjection of the CSA complex restored the ability to recover RNA synthesis in CS group A cells after UV-irradiation. These activities were specific for the two complexes. As might be anticipated, the CSA complex had no effect on the NER activity of XP-E cells and vice versa [33]. Both the DDB2 and CSA complexes also contained cullin 4A and Roc1, known ubiquitin ligase components, and both complexes displayed ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. This finding is consistent with previous suggestions of an involvement of DDB in gaining access to DNA damage in chromatin. DDB1 and cullin 4A have also been found in ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes, interacting with various viral transcription activators [35]. However, the exact substrates for the ubiquitin ligase activities in the various complexes still remain to be determined. Both the DDB2 and CSA complexes contained, in addition, components of the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a regulator of cullin-based ubiquitin ligases. Eight subunits, CSN1­CSN8, were detected in each complex. Experiments indicated that the CSN complex acts as a negative regulator of the ubiquitin ligase activity in the DDB2 and CSA complexes, by suppressing ubiquitin ligase activity and by depolymerizing ubiquitin chains. This activity of the CSN components appears to be functionally important. The authors found that knockdown of the CSN5 component by the siRNA technique reduced the repair activity of the DDB2 complex and the RNA synthesis recovery activity of the CSA complex by about 50% in each case. In further experiments, Groisman et al. [33] confirmed the UV-dependent binding of DDB2 and associated proteins to a tightly-bound chromatin state. The CSA complex did not show such binding to dam-

aged DNA, but instead was found to bind to RNA polymerase II. This is interesting, as CSA is known to function specifically in transcription-coupled NER, somehow helping cells repair lesions in the transcribed DNA strand faster than lesions in the non-transcribed strand. The results suggest an attractive symmetry: the CSA complex is specific for transcription-coupled NER, facilitated by interaction with RNA polymerase II, while the DDB2 complex is specific for transcription-independent NER, acting globally on DNA that is packaged into chromatin. What are the targets for the finely-regulated ubiquitin modification or degradation activity of these complexes? The DDB2 and CSA subunits themselves are possible candidates, but further work is needed to determine whether these are indeed targets. DDB1 everywhere: Homologues of DDB1 are found in a number of eukaryotic species that do not encode a DDB2 homologue. Of particular interest, a null mutation in two COP9 signalosome components in fission yeast causes mild UV-sensitivity. A recent study has now unveiled a protein complex that contains, in addition to CSN1­5 and CSN-7, cullin 4 and the fission yeast DDB1 [36]. The authors demonstrate that one biological function for this complex is degradation of Spd1, a protein inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase. In mammalian cells, it is noteworthy that DDB1 or DDB1-like proteins have been found in a significant number of other complexes. Interestingly, two recent reports describe complexes that have a connection with DNA damage and chromatin. Martinez et al. [37] reported that DDB1 was found in the multi-protein complex SPT3-TAFII 31-GCN5L acetylase (STAGA), a transcriptional co-activator capable of acetylating both free and nucleosomal histones. The complex, furthermore, has UV-dependent DNA-binding [37]. A protein (SAP130) with sequence similarity to DDB1 [34] has been found in another TBP-free TAFII complex (TFTC). TFTC is able to bind UV-damaged DNA in vitro in both a free and a nucleosomal context. Furthermore, the complex preferentially acetylates nucleosomes assembled on UV-irradiated DNA [38]. One mystery regarding xeroderma pigmentosum has been that mutations giving rise to XP group E are all found in the gene encoding the DDB2 subunit of DDB, and never have been detected in the DDB1 gene. The recent set of results suggest a possible reason

for this: inactivation of DDB1 would simultaneously affect the DDB2 and CSA complexes, as well as the STAGA complex. Such concurrent disruption of complexes for global genome repair, transcription-coupled repair and transcription by inactivation of DDB1 might be incompatible with cell viability. References
