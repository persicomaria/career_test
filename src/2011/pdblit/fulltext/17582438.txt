Abstract Site-directed mutagenesis and domain exchange were used to investigate the role of the C-terminal domains of Staphylococcus hyicus lipase (SHL) and S. aureus lipase (SAL) in substrate selectivity. The introduction of a single point mutation coding for the substitution of Val for Ser356 in SHL yields an enzyme which has retained full lipase activity, but with more than 12-fold lower phospholipase activity. Starting with this S356V variant of SHL the C-terminal 40 amino acids were replaced by the corresponding SAL sequence. Although 23 amino acid changes were introduced simultaneously the impact on the phospholipase/lipase activity ratio was only 4-fold. We therefore conclude that in the C-terminal domain it is Ser356 which mainly determines phospholipase activity. The introduction of a Val357 to Ser substitution in SAL did not turn SAL into a phospholipase, showing that residues from other domains contribute to this activity as well. The results are discussed in view of the sequence homology of lipases and (lyso)phospholipases. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lipases (acylglycerol hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3) catalyse the hydrolysis of neutral lipids. Lipases share with other carboxyl esterases that the nucleophilic attack on the ester carbon of the scissile ester bond is facilitated by the presence of three amino acids which constitute the so-called catalytic triad. A negatively charged residue (aspartic acid, but sometimes glutamic acid) and a histidine

activate a serine hydroxyl in analogy with the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases (Ollis et al., 1992; Rubin, 1994). In lipases the enzyme is activated by the presence of a lipid ­ water interface and this phenomenon distinguishes lipases from proteases and most other carboxyl esterases. This so-called interfacial activation was described as early as 1958 (Sarda and Desnuelle, 1958) and its molecular background has been attributed to the movement of an h-helical surface loop that normally covers the active site, but moves away upon interaction with the interface. The consequences of this movement are several fold: it makes the catalytic residues accessible to substrate, it may create the oxy-anion hole, and it creates a surface-exposed hydrophobic area which can interact with the lipid ­ water interface in general and with a single substrate molecule in particular (Rubin, 1994). This movement may thus be involved in substrate recognition, but so far little information has been obtained about the actual interactions involved. Lipases have evolved to hydrolyse neutral lipids like triglycerides at the lipid ­ water interface. However, their minimal substrate requirement is relaxed and most lipases accept a wide variety of hydrophobic, water-insoluble esters as a substrate. Regarding naturally occurring substrates, lipases act on neutral apolar lipids like tri- and diglycerides, but a few lipases are in addition highly active on phospholipids as well. One example of a lipase which hydrolyses phospholipids is the enzyme from guinea pig pancreas (GPLRP2). This enzyme undoubtedly serves a digestive role since the guinea pig pancreas lacks the 14 kDa phospholipase normally present in the pancreas of most mammals (Fauvel et al., 1981; Hjorth et al., 1993). Although the phospholipase activity of GPLRP2 was first attributed to the absence of an h-helix structure covering the active site, more recent studies with coypu pancreatic lipase and the construction of hybrid lipases between GPLRP2 and human pancreatic lipase (Carriere ` et al., 1997) showed that the origin of phospholipase activity is more complex. Several staphylococci produce lipases. The enzymes are all capable of hydrolysing triglycerides, but only the enzyme from Staphylococcus hyicus

can degrade phospholipids at rates comparable to triglyceride hydrolysis (Simons et al., 1996). A structure-based explanation of the different selectivities is not available because no X-ray structures are known of S. hyicus lipase (SHL) or S. aureus lipase (SAL). In order to localise those residues involved in substrate recognition, a chimeric protein of SHL and SAL has been made by directed domain exchange of the C-terminal 146 amino acids of SHL with the corresponding SAL fragment (Nikoleit et al., 1995). Based on this study it became clear that the C-terminal domain, containing the active site residues Asp314 and His355, is required for phospholipase selectivity. To explain the different substrate specificities of the staphylococcal lipases we used sequence alignment of four staphylococcal lipases to identify amino acid side chains involved in phospholipid binding in the C-terminal domain of SHL. We focused our attention on the residues that surround the Asp314 and His355 in the assumption that substrate molecules will necessarily make contacts in that area of the structure. While the residues surrounding the aspartate are quite variable, the residue following the histidine is of special interest as it is Val or Leu in all true lipases, but Ser in SHL. Moreover, this side chain probably points into the active site cavity as is evident from all known lipase structures. Thus, in the C-terminal domain comprising the last forty amino acids, we were able to identify four residues, including Ser356 directly following the active site histidine, as residues possibly involved in the binding of the phosphate group. Their importance was verified by the introduction of a single point mutation coding for a Ser356 to Val substitution. This mutation opened the possibility to introduce the C-terminal forty amino acids of SAL, including the other three putative phosphate ligands, into SHL because it created a restriction site already present in SAL. The effect of both exchanges was determined on phospholipase and on lipase activities and an attempt was made to evaluate the position of the important residues in the X-ray structure of Pseudomonas glumae lipase (Noble et al., 1994).

2. Experimental procedures

2.1. Chemicals
Oligonucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia. 2-Hexadecanoylthio-ethane-1-phosphocholine (C16thioPC) and rac-1,2-dihexanoyldithiopropyl3-phosphocholine (diC6dithioPC) were synthesized as described before (Aarsman et al., 1976; Volwerk et al., 1979). p-Nitrophenyl esters were obtained from Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetate was obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were of analytical grade.

tution V357S was introduced into the WT-SAL gene of pMK2 using mutagenic oligonucleotides 5% - GATTGGGATCATAGTGACTTTGTAGG AC-3% and 5%- GTCCTACAAAGTCACTATGATCCCAATC-3%.

2.3. Expression
E. coli strain DH5h transformed with the construct was grown on a 1 l scale for 24 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and dissolved in 100 ml buffer A (6 M GuHCl, 10 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM imidazole). After centrifugation of the lysate (30 min, 16000× g), the clear supernatant was incubated with 10 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetate resin (QIAGEN) in buffer A, using a rotating wheel for 4 h at 4°C. Subsequently, the resin was washed 3 times for 15 min at 4°C with 100 ml buffer A for S356V-SHL and S356V-SHL/ SAL or with 2×100 ml buffer B (10 mM Tris/ HCl pH8.0, 5 mM imidazole) and 1× 100 ml buffer C (10 mM Tris/HCl pH8.0, 50 mM imidazole) for V357S-SAL and loaded onto a column. The protein was eluted with 20 ml 500 mM imidazole in buffer A. The eluted lipase was dialysed against 5 mM NaAc pH 6.0.

2.2. DNA manipulations and construction of plasmids
All enzymes for DNA manipulations were purchased from New England Biolabs and applied according to manufacturer's instructions. E. coli strain DH5h (Hanahan, 1983) was used for all plasmid constructions. The construction of plasmids pH6SHT7 and pH6SAB7 has been described before (Simons et al., 1996). The Xba I/Pst I fragment of plasmid pH6SHT7, encoding the histidine-tagged mature WT-SHL, was cloned into the corresponding sites of plasmid pUC18, resulting in plasmid pMK1. The Xba I/Pst I fragment of plasmid pH6SAB7, encoding the histidine-tagged mature WT-SAL, was cloned into the corresponding sites of plasmid pUC18, resulting in plasmid pMK2. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site directed mutagenesis method according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The substitution S356V was introduced into the WTSHL gene of pMK1 using mutagenic oligonucleotides 5%-GGTTGGGATCATGTTGACTTTATTGG-3% and 5%-CCAATAAAGTCAACATGATCCCAACC-3%, thereby generating a Hinc II site. The sites of the mutations are underlined. The Mfe I/Pst I fragment of the mutant was sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977) and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pMK1. The Hinc II/ Pst I fragment of this plasmid was replaced by the corresponding SAL fragment of pMK2, resulting in plasmid S356V-SHL/SAL. The substi-

2.4. Enzymatic acti6ity measurements
Activities were determined spectrophotometrically at pH 8.0 (50 mM Tris/HCl) in the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 at room temperature. Activity towards pNPC4 was determined in mixed micelles with Triton X-100 (0.75 mM substrate in 5 mM Triton X-100). The formation of the p-nitrophenoxide ion was monitored at 400 nm. Activity on phospholipids was determined in mixed micelles using C16thioPC as a substrate (0.25 mM in 0.2 mM Triton X-100) or on pure micelles of diC6dithioPC (3 mM). In the phospholipase assays 0.2 mM 5, 5%-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) was included and the increase in absorption was followed at 412 nm. Activities are given in Units (1 Unit is the conversion of 1 vmole substrate per min) and were calculated using molar absorption coefficients of 16888 M - 1 cm - 1 (p-nitrophenoxide) and 13600 M - 1 cm - 1 (2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid anion).

3. Results In the present study, we wished to investigate the contribution of the C-terminal domain of SHL (which includes residues 356 ­ 396) to phospholipase activity. To this end, we used an approach of sequence homology analysis in combination with the known substrate specificity of staphylococcal lipases. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of residues 353 ­ 396 of SHL with the corresponding sequences of SEL from S. epidermidis strain RP62A and SAL from the S. aureus strains PS54 (SAL1) and NCTC8530 (SAL2) (Lee and Iandolo, 1986; Nikoleit et al., 1995; Gotz, F., ¨ personal communication). Previous characterisation has shown that SEL and SAL2 are not able to hydrolyse phospholipids (Simons et al., 1996; Simons, J.-W.F.A., personal communication). The substrate specificity of SAL1 has not been characterised extensively, but this lipase is also inactive towards phospholipids (Iandolo, J.J., personal communication). It can readily be seen that the sequences can be aligned with the strongest homology occurring at the residues near the active site His355. In order to identify residues which are important for phospholipase activity, the alignment was examined for residues that are unique for SHL. We specifically searched for residues which can interact with the phosphate group (neutral hydrogen bond donors and basic residues). In this way we were able to identify Ser356 (found at the position following the active site His), His368, Ser381 and Tyr383 as possible candidates to fix the phosphate.

To verify this hypothesis, we concentrated our efforts on Ser356. An important argument to start with Ser356 was that this mutation created a Hinc II site which is already present at the corresponding position in SAL2. Instead of replacing residues His368, Ser381 and Tyr383 one by one, we used this newly created restriction site to exchange all forty C-terminal amino acids of SHL by the corresponding SAL sequence, resulting in a S356V-SHL/SAL hybrid. His-tagged S356V-SHL and S356V-SHL/SAL were expressed in 1 l cultures, and purified by affinity chromatography to greater than 95% purity in yields of 15 mg. The effect of the substitutions on lipase and phospholipase activities was determined with pNPC4 and C16thioPC as substrates. Specific activities and phospholipase/lipase ratios were determined of WT and the variant SHLs and the data are shown in Table 1. Remarkably, the single Ser to Val mutation causes a more than 12-fold reduction in the phospholipase/lipase ratio while the lipase acTable 1 Specific activities of WT and mutant SHL and SAL C16thioPC pNPC4 (U mg-1) (U mg-1) Ratio C16thioPC/ pNPC4 1.0 0.08 0.02 0 0

tivity on pNPC4 is not affected. The introduction of 23 additional substitutions in the S356V-SHL/ SAL hybrid only causes a further 4-fold reduction in this ratio. Taken together, these findings indicate that within this C-terminal domain, the effect of the single Ser to Val mutation is larger than that of an additional 23-amino acid change, including the putative ligands His368, Ser381 and Tyr383. Therefore we conclude that in this C-terminal domain Ser356 is the major determinant for phospholipase activity of SHL. In the active site of SHL the phosphate group of the phospholipid may be surrounded and fixed by more than just one residue with the consequence that phospholipase activity requires more than the presence of Ser356. To answer this question we wondered if it would be possible to introduce phospholipase activity into SAL by replacing Val357 with a Ser. This mutant enzyme was expressed on a 1 l scale and purified in a final yield of 65 mg. Specific activities of WT-SAL and V357S-SAL were determined and are shown in Table 1. From the data, it is clear that V357SSAL has an even higher lipase activity than WTSAL, but that it is not able to degrade the phospholipid analogue C16thioPC. As it has been shown previously that SAL prefers short-chain substrates (Simons et al., 1996), phospholipase activity of V357S-SAL was also determined using the short-chain phospholipid diC6dithioPC. Also with this substrate no increased activity could be detected (data not shown). We therefore conclude that the presence of a Ser356 is not the only factor needed for phospholipase activity and that one or more residues from other domains contribute to substrate specificity as well.

4. Discussion The four staphylococcal enzymes which were compared in this study are homologous proteins of 386­399 amino acids of which about 50% is conserved. Despite this homology SHL is the only enzyme which hydrolyses phospholipids. A previous study showed that the residues that must be involved in phospholipase specificity are localised in a 146 amino acid C-terminal domain (Nikoleit

et al., 1995). Ideally these residues could be identified on the basis of structural analysis. However no X-ray structure of the staphylococcal lipases, either alone or complexed with a substrate analogue, is available. Despite this drawback we can safely assume that these lipases belong to the superfamily of h/i hydrolases and that the core of the protein can be compared with that of lipases of known X-ray structure. For this comparison we selected the lipase from Pseudomonas glumae (PGL). The first half of this sequence could easily be aligned with the sequence of its staphylococcal counterparts, but the middle part of the sequence could not be readily aligned (not shown). However, the regions around active site residues could be aligned and this is shown for the active site histidine and the C-terminal domain which follows it (see Fig. 1). The homology of the C-terminal domain is very low, but the number of residues following the active site histidine is comparable in all five enzymes. This sequence forms an h-helix in PGL (Noble et al., 1994) as it probably does so in the staphylococcal lipases too. Despite the possible presence of h-helical structures for the five enzymes, the exact location of the individual residues is difficult to predict. The exchange of the C-terminal SHL domain for the SAL domain, with a simultaneous change of 23 amino acids, lowers both lipase and phospholipase activity. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this substitution has removed a specific protein-substrate interaction, the lowered activities might very well be ascribed to a changed orientation of the whole C-terminal h-helix. The position of Ser356 in SHL is better defined and can be inferred from the PGL structure where this residue points into the active site cavity. Recent X-ray studies (Lang et al., 1998) of Pseudomonas sp. ATCC 21808 lipase, inhibited with a trioctylglycerolphosphonate, have shown that the carbonyl oxygen of the sn-3 moiety is oriented towards the side chain of Leu287, which is the equivalent position 356 in the SHL numbering of Fig. 1. This finding supports our notion that Ser356, following the active site His of SHL, is a good candidate for interaction with the polar head group of the phospholipid substrate.

A large number of enzymes has been identified, isolated and sequenced on the basis of their lipase activity. They are all serine hydrolases and contain the h/i hydrolase fold (Ollis et al., 1992). The active site histidine is invariably followed by a hydrophobic residue, in general Val or Leu. Several other enzymes have been identified on the basis of their phospholipase or lysophospholipase activities. The best studied examples are the secretory phospholipases A2 from mammalian pancreas and snake venom. However, these enzymes are not serine hydrolases and thus form an independent class. A second group contains serine hydrolases with (lyso)phospholipase activity, but in general less well characterised lipase activity. Such enzymes are: GPLRP2 and coypu pancreatic lipase (Hjorth et al., 1993; Thirstrup et al., 1994), a phospholipase A1 from hornet venom (Soldatova et al., 1993), a serine phospholipid-specific phospholipase A and lysophospholipase I (Sato et al., 1997) from mammals and a number of related putative esterases from micro-organisms (Wang et al., 1997 and references therein). In these eleven sequences of serine hydrolases with high (lyso)phospholipase activity, the active site histidine is followed by His (1x), Ala (1x), Thr (1x), Met (2x), Glu (2x) and Ser (4x), but never a branched hydrophobic residue like Val or Leu. This observation underscores our notion that Ser356 is essential for the interaction with the phospholipid substrate. However, the fact that a single Val to Ser substitution in SAL does not introduce phospholipase activity shows that more than one interaction is needed. Future experiments, like sequence comparison of the various hydrolases with (lyso)phospholipase activity, in combination with site-directed mutagenesis in the C-terminal domain of SHL may further deepen our insight.
