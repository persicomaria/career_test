Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction Studies on the Histocompatibility Antigens HLA-A2 and HLA-A28 from Human Cell Membranes
The human histocompatibility antigens HLA-A and HLA-B are polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex. These molecules are the major targets for the immune response during tissue transplantation. They are recognized by cytolytic T-lymphocytes during the immune response against virally infected cells, and have been linked to variations in susceptibility to human autoaggressive and neoplastic diseases. To permit a description of the sites of interaction with alloantisera and T-cell receptors, we have begun a three-dimensional structure determination of HLA-A. We report the isomorphous crystallization of two antigenic specificities of papain-solubilized HLA-A, A2 and A28. Isoelectric focusing indicates that the well-ordered crystals incorporate the sialic acid microheterogeneity of the oligosaccharides. Crystallographic evidence indicates that the HLA-A molecule has an approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry axis which, combined with biochemical data, suggests that the domains of the molecule are paired a1 to t12 and a3 to b,-microglobulin. This domain organization is similar to t,he arrangement of domains in the Fab and Fc fragments of immunoglobulins.

HLA, a class I transplantation antigen, is an membrane protein composed of two integral polypeptide chains (Cresswell et al., 1973): the HLA heavy chain, a glycoprotein coded in the major complex, and fiz-microglobulin histocompatibility (Grey et al., 1973; Peterson et al., 1974; Berggard & Bearn, 1968). Amino acid sequences of the HLA heavy chain indicate that 34,000 M, and one carbohyclrate moiety exist as an N-terminal extracellular region, 24 uncharged hydrophobic amino acid residues span the membrane bilayer, and 30 residues comprise a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain al., (Strominger et 1979). /?,-Microglobulin with the extracellular (12,000 Mr), associated portion of HLA, shows sequence homology to the C,3 domain of immunoglobulins (Peterson et al., 1972; Smithies & Poulik, 1972). Primary sequence data for the extracellular portion of the HLA heavy chain suggest a three-part structure: an N-terminal glycosylated region (a,, 91 amino acid residues), followed by two regions (a, and as, 91 and 92 amino acid residues) each containing large disulfide loops reminiscent of those in immunoglobulin domains (Terhorst' et al., 1977). In the human genome, the three regions a,, a2 and a3 are encoded by separate exons, suggesting that they may have arisen from a common ancestral gene (Malissen et al., 1982). The second disulfide loop region, as, exhibits amino acid to immunoglobulin constant sequence homology domains at the same level of significance as different immunoglobulin constant domains show to each other and to /l,-miaroglobulin (Orr et al., 1979, Tragardh et al.. 1979). Sequence homology has been observed between the regions a1 and a2 but, with exception of the suggestive disulfide loop in az, no significant sequence homology links aI or a2 to a3 or

B,-microglobulin. Based on these homologies and circular dichroism studies indicating a predominance of B-pleated sheet in HLA (Lancet et al., 1979), it has been suggested that the a3 and BZmicroglobulin regions of HLA may fold into immunoglobulin-like domains (Orr et al.. 1979). Upon removal of a carbohydrate moiety, proteolysis of the H-2 antigen (the murine analog of HLA) releases the a3 domain bound to P-microglobulin, suggesting that these regions are paired in the intact molecule (Yokoyama & Nathenson, 1983). (a) Crystallization The hydrophilic extracellular portion of the HLA molecule can be released from the membrane by papain (first shown by Nathenson & Shimada (1968) for mouse H-2 antigens), as a soluble glycoprotein with full antigenic activity. Because this extracellular moiety exists as a stable structure independent of the membrane segment, we have crystallized the papain-released portion of HLA in order to circumvent aggregation problems. HLA-A2 and A28 were purified from the cell membranes of homozygous human lymphoblastoid cell lines (Turner et al., 1975; Parham et aE., 1977). Crystals of both were grown from protein solutions (15 mg/ml in 25 mM-2-(iV-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid or 100 mi\l-imidazole, pH 6.2 to 6.5) in two-microliter drops with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 by vapor diffusion. Sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of washed crystals demonstrated that they contain both pZmicroglobulin and the papain-released heavy chain. Isoelectric focusing was used to examine the HLA incorporated into crystals, because the HLA-A2

The asymmetric unit of the crystal is estimated to contain one molecule based on average volume to mass ratios (I',,,) of protein crystals (Mathews, 1968). The orthorhombic crystal has reciprocal lattice symmetry D, with odd reflections absent along a, b and c. This establishes the space group as P2,2,21. The unit cell dimensions are a = 60.2 A. b = 80.4 A. c = 112.2 A and one molecule per asymmetric unit, as estimated above. (c) HLA-A28 crystals

Both dissolved crystals and pure protein sialic acid-containing contain multiple subof molecules (data not shown). populations Contaminating amounts of HLA-B7 seen in purified HLA-A2 protein are not, however, incorporated into the A2 crystals.

(b) P2,2,2, packing arrangement viewed down the b axis. To simplify the real space comparison to the P2, unit cell (broken lines), the origin of the P2,2,21 lattice has been drawn at the 2-fold screw axis along b. Molecules in the P2,212, lattice are drawn to occupy specific positions (y = 0. z = 0). In these positions. the objects labeled 1 to 4 are arranged similarly to the objects labeled 1 to 4 in the monoclinic lattice. However, objects 2 and 3 are rotated by 180" with respect to objects 1 and 4 in the orthorhombic lattice. whereas all objects in the monoclinic lattice are oriented in the same direction with respect to the plane of the paper. This difference is due to the presence of 2-fold screw axes perpendicular to the b axis in the orthorhombic space group that are absent in the monoclinic space group. We propose that the HLA molecule is nearly invariant. to the 2-fold rotation operation that differentiates molecules 1 and 2 in the monoclinic cell from molecules 1 and 2 in the orthorhombic cell. To achieve this. the molecule would have an approximate dyad axis perpendicular to the crystallographic b axis.

An examination of the relationship of the two crystal forms of HLA-A2 suggests that a common packing scheme is utilized to generate the two space groups. The packing model also suggests that the HLA molecule has an approximate 2-fold rotational symmetry axis. The two crystal forms of HLA-A2 are closely related. The n and b axes of both lattices are nearly identical in orientation and length. In one orientation, transforms can be compared directly because they are sampled in identical positions. Figure 1 shows a comparison of the hk0 P2,2,2, photograph and the comparable photograph taken from a P2, crystal (the X-ray beam parallel to the real space [102] axis). The lattices are superdistributions are imposable, and the intensity similar to low resolution. Crystals of both space groups are morphologically identical, and crystals of one form will grow when crushed seed crystals of the other form are added to the crystallization solution. These observations, in addition to the similarity of the lattices (both in dimensions and transform), imply that the packing of molecules is similar in both space groups. If the

Objects are drawn in the positions y = 0, z = 0. which are positions that four L-fold symmetric objects can occupy in the space group B22,P. An exactly 2-fold symmetric object would be indistinguishable facing up with respect to the plane of the paper or facing down (thus objects are labeled (u, d)). The presence of pseudo-centering in the HLA-A2 P2,2,2, data towards the space group B22,2 suggests that, molecules in the P2,2,2, lattice are arranged as shown in this Figure. and that each molecule contains an approximate dyad axis. This packing arrangement is identical to the packing arrangement in (b). which is independently derived from the similaritv between the monoclinic and orthorhombic latbices. Th`is Figure does not represent the only packing arrangement of the molecules in each unit cell that would explain the similarity in the space groups and the pseudo facecentering observed in the P2,2,2, data. For example. the diagrams could be redrawn t,o position molecules at r = 0. y = l/4. This arrangement would predict that the approximate HLA molecular dyad would be parallel t,o the a axis. There are no data at present to favor either the a or the c axis as the direction of the approximabe molecular 2-fold axis.

Figure 3. Proposed model for the domain organization of HLA-A. Crystallographic evidence suggests that the molecule is approximately 2-fold symmetric, implying that the homologous domains of HLA are paired al to ~2, and cr3 to /?,-microglobulin (/&m). This pairing of domains has been suggested, based on the similarities between class I and class II antigens (see e.g. Kaufman et al., 1984).

unit cell are placed molecules in the orthorhombic in specific positions (y = 0 or l/4, either 2 or z = 0), then molecules in both lattices can be packed in a similar arrangement. Figure 2(a) and (b) illustrate how four molecules in one orthorhombic unit cell can be arranged in a similar manner to four molecules in a nearly orthogonal cell formed in the P2, lattice by the a, b and [102] axes. Tn the orthorhombic unit cell, two of the four molecules are rotated by 180" due to the presence of the 2-fold screw axes perpendicular to the b axis, while the analogous molecules in these positions in the P2, lattice are related only by a translation. That is. molecules 1 and 2 in Figure 2(a) are related by a 2-fold screw axis parallel to the b axis in the monoclinic cell, but molecules 1 and 2 in the orthorhombic cell (their positional counterparts) are related by a 2-fold screw axis parallel to the a axis. Thus, if molecule 2 is considered to be facing up in the monoclinic cell, its counterpart will be facing down in the orthorhombic cell. Similarly, molecules 1 and 3 are related by a translation in the monoclinic cell. but by a 2-fold screw axis parallel to c in the orthorhombic cell. The common packing arrangement of the and orthorhombic HLA crystals, monoclinic differing only (except for the cell constant difference between space groups in the orthorhombic c direction) in the orientation of molecules up or down with respect to the b axis, suggests that t'he shape of the molecule involved in packing is nearly invariant to a 180" rotation; i.e. the molecule rotational 2-fold contains an approximate symmetry axis (perpendicular to the b axis of either lattice). The similarity, to low resolution, of the intensity distribution (in projection: Fig. 1) of t'he transform of the P2, lattice (in which all molecules are aligned in the same direction with respect to t,he b axis) to the transform of the P2,2,2, lattice (in which one half of the molecules are rotated by 180" with respect to the b axis) is another indication that

Letters to the Editor preceding scheme for the packing of the HLA crystals comes from the observed pseudo-centering at low resolution in the P2,2,2, data toward the space group B22,2t. Three-dimensional data to 7.4 A resolution have been collected on the HLA-A2 orthorhombic crystal by automatic diffractometry (857 reflections, R = 1.99%). The h+Z = 2n+ 1 reflections are absent or weak to 20.0A resolution (Ih+l=evenl~h+l=odd = 2-7) consistent with the scape group B22,2, in which these reflections would be absent. An approximate inversion center at u = l/4, u, = l/4 in the h0Z native Patterson projection and approximate mirror planes at u = l/4 and v = l/4 in the hh9 projection (Fig. 4) are consistent with the molecules being packed in an approximately centered relationship. Since there are only four molecules in the unit cell, these observations of pseudo-centering also suggest the existence of an approximate molecular 2-fold rotational symmetry axis (see Fig. 2(c)).
