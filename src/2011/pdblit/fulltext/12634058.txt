Mycobacteria are major human pathogens responsible for such serious and widespread diseases as tuberculosis and leprosy. Among the evolutionary adaptations essential for pathogenicity in mycobacteria is a complex carbohydrate-rich cell-wall structure that contains as a major immunomodulatory molecule the polysaccharide lipoarabinomannan (LAM). We report here crystal structures of three fragments from the non-reducing termini of LAM in complex with a murine antibody Fab fragment (CS35Fab). These structures reveal for the first time the three-dimensional structures of key components of LAM and the molecular basis of LAM recognition at between 1.8- and 2.0-Å resolution. The antigen-binding site of CS-35Fab forms three binding pockets that show a high degree of complementarity to the reducing end, the branch point and one of the non-reducing ends of the Y-shaped hexasaccharide moiety found at most of the non-reducing termini of LAM. Structures of CS-35Fab bound to two additional tetrasaccharides confirm the general mode of binding seen in the hexasaccharide and indicate how different parts of LAM are recognized. Altogether, these structures provide a rational basis for understanding the overall architecture of LAM and identify the key elements of an epitope that may be exploited for the development of novel and more effective antimycobacterial vaccines. Moreover, this study represents the first highresolution X-ray crystallographic investigation of oligofuranoside­protein recognition.

diseases, the emergence of drug-resistant strains and the difficulty of treating tuberculosis in immunocompromised patients present serious health care challenges.2­4 More effective vaccines and antiinfective therapeutics are currently being sought to deal with the public health problems expected to arise from mycobacterial diseases in the near future.5 An attractive target for the development of both novel vaccines and drug therapeutics is the unusual cell-wall structure that is characteristic of all mycobacteria and related actinomycetes. This complex macromolecular assembly provides a critical barrier to the passage of antibiotics and allows the pathogenic organisms to evade clearance by the host immune system.6 Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), which consists of a polymannosylated phosphatidylinositol core functionalized with an arabinan polysaccharide, is a major component of the outermost layer of the cell wall.

LAM consists solely of D-arabinofuranose (Araf) residues, and the non-reducing termini of the glycan are capped with either branched hexasaccharide 1 or a related tetrasaccharide 27­9 (Fig. 1). In some strains, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a portion of these motifs is further capped with short mannopyranosyl oligosaccharides to provide a structure termed ManLAM.7,8 Although it has been postulated that these mannose oligosaccharide

383 single 1:1 protein/carbohydrate complex in the asymmetric unit. Because the bound carbohydrate antigen does not participate in any crystal packing interaction, the interactions between protein and carbohydrate do not appear to be perturbed by forces from the crystal lattice and presumably reflect the binding mode seen in solution. The antigen-binding site of CS-35Fab contains a broad groove at one end and a triangular canyon at the other end that is highly complementary to the Y-shaped branched hexasaccharide at the nonreducing terminus of LAM (Figs. 2 and 3). Approximately 509 Å2 or 43% of the accessible surface area of compound 3 is buried upon binding to CS-35Fab. The broad groove formed by complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs) L1, L2 and H3 provides a wide channel to accommodate the reducing end of all three of the bound oligosaccharides. In complexes with native LAM, this groove would be expected to accommodate much longer subterminal structures extending from residue A, far beyond the surface of the antibody.7,8 The three CDRs forming this groove, as well as CDR L3, also form a shallow specificity

However, little is known about the specificity of antibodies that recognize LAM. Recent investigations on the prototypical murine anti-LAM antibody CS-3520 have shown that arabinan motifs are recognized by antibodies of this type.21,22 To provide a molecular basis for understanding the interactions between this polysaccharide and cognate antibodies, we have determined for the first time crystal structures of CS-35Fab in complex with Arafcontaining LAM oligosaccharide fragments 3-5.

pocket for residue A at the reducing end of each of the three bound oligosaccharides. This pocket is dominated by the aromatic side chains of four Tyr residues and one Phe residue, but two aliphatic side chains and two polar side chains also make key interactions. The 2-OH of residue A forms a watermediated hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn34/L (numbering according to Kabat, as implemented in Abnum), 23 while the 3-OH donates a direct hydrogen bond to the side-chain carboxylate group of Asp91/L and forms a watermediated hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of the same residue (Fig. 3b). Residue B lies at the branch point of the Y-shaped hexasaccharide and is surrounded by the residues

of CDR H3. Residues 95­98 (FGNY) fold around residue B in a manner that allows Phe95/H and Tyr98/H to form a clamp around the sugar ring. Phe95/H lies at the centre of the triangular canyonlike antigen-binding site, providing contacts with residues A, B, C and E surrounding the branch point (Fig. 3a and b). Notably, the peptide bond between Phe95/H and Gly96/H adopts the cis conformation, which is extremely rare for peptide bonds not preceding proline.24,25 Quite strikingly, a cis peptide bond preceding a non-proline residue [Gln97/H in Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1SM3] has also previously been seen in a position similar to that of the CDR H3 loop of the breast-tumour specific

386 antibody SM3 bound to a peptide derived from mucin.26,27 Although the overall conformation of CDR H3 in the SM3­muc1 complex does not resemble the conformation adopted by CDR H3 in CS-35Fab, it is interesting to consider how nonproline cis peptide bonds in these two and possibly other CDR H3 loops may affect the structure of the H3 loop and antigen recognition. In compounds 3 and 4, residues C and E extend into a second specificity pocket formed primarily by CDRs H1, H2 and L3 (Fig. 2b). Two key residues in CDR H1 contribute key binding interactions. Trp33/H forms hydrophobic stacking interactions with residues C and E and donates a hydrogen bond to the 5-OH group of residue C. His35/H lies at the base of the binding pocket for residue E and donates a hydrogen bond to the 2-OH group. CDR H2 provides structural support for positioning Trp33/H and forms a critical hydrogen-bonding network with residue E (Figs. 2b and 3). The 3-OH group of residue C donates a hydrogen bond to the side-chain oxygen atom of Asn58/H and accepts a hydrogen bond from the side-chain OH group of Ser50/H, which in turn accepts a hydrogen bond from the side-chain nitrogen atom of Asn58/H. CDR L3 forms the remaining side of the binding pocket by contributing van der Waals packing interactions from Pro94/L and a water-mediated hydrogen bond from the Tyr96/L side-chain OH group to the ring oxygen of residue E. Because the peptide bond between Pro94/L and Pro95/L adopts the cis conformation, Pro94/L and Tyr96/L stack against each other to form the third side of the binding pocket for residue E. The amount of contact between the monosaccharide residues in compounds 3­5 and the protein is consistent with the previously reported affinities of these glycans as measured using electrospray mass spectrometry.22 Hexasaccharide 3 binds with the strongest affinity (1 × 105 M), followed by tetrasaccharide 4 (2 × 104 M) and finally tetrasaccharide 5 (no detectable binding in the electrospray mass spectrometry assay). It is notable that the sequences and structures of CDRs H1 and H2 show striking similarities to several other antibodies of known structure, including Se155-4, a well-characterized murine monoclonal antibody specific for Salmonella serogroup type B

lipopolysaccharide. 28 In Se155-4, Trp33/H and His35/H are positioned very similarly to the same residues in CS-35 to form half of the binding specificity pocket for the -D-abequose and -Dmannose residues at the core of the bound oligosaccharide. Other parts of the antibody-combining site, including the other half of the residue E specificity pocket formed by CDR L3, differ significantly between CS-35 and Se155-4. In compounds 3 and 5, residues D and F extend away from the surface of CS-35Fab and show significant disorder in electron density maps (Fig. 4a and c). The 3-OH group of residue D forms a hydrogen bond with the side-chain OH group of Tyr98/H in compound 5, and the 5-OH group forms water-mediated hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Asn31/H, the side-chain OH group of Tyr52/H and the sidechain nitrogen of Asn97/H, as well as the ring oxygen of residue C. Residue F is poorly defined by electron density and appears to be nearly completely exposed to solvent. The lack of interactions between residue F and CS-35Fab is consistent with the minor effect on binding affinity when residue F is absent.22 Structural features of protein-bound oligo-D-arabinofuranosides The structures of oligosaccharides 3­5 in our crystal structures reveal several novel principles governing the conformation of oligo-D-arabinofuranosides. The core pentasaccharide structure consisting of residues A to E is very well ordered when bound to CS-35Fab. As a result, the electron density maps for the complexes formed with compounds 3 and 4 (calculated with data extending to 2.0- and 1.8-Å resolutions, respectively) reveal critical details about the conformations of glycosidic linkages and ring puckers (Fig. 3). The two -(1  5) linkages connecting residues A and B, as well as B and C, adopt extended conformations, but differences in ring puckering and glycosidic bond angles lead to differing arrangements of sugar rings (Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Fig. 1). The extended glycosidic bond connecting residues A and B, in combination

with the N-type ring puckers for both of these residues, minimizes interactions between the two rings. In contrast, the less extended glycosidic bond connecting residues B and C, together with the Ntype ring pucker for residue B and the E-type ring pucker for residue C, leads to an arrangement in which the two furanose rings face each other, thus promoting the formation of a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the 2-OH of residue B and the 3-OH of residue C. The ABC trisaccharide segment reveals how differences in ring puckering and glycosidic bond angles can lead to strikingly different arrangements of sugar rings and hints at the structural flexibility and diversity likely present in the -(1  5) backbone predominantly found in LAM. Similar to the more extended -(1  5) linkages, the more constrained -(1  2) and -(1  3) linkages for the two non-reducing termini reveal differing arrangements of sugar residues arising from the interplay of glycosidic angles and ring puckers. The -(1  2) linkage between residues C and E, as well as the E-type ring pucker for residue C and the N-type ring pucker for residue E, also leads to an arrangement of the sugar rings that promotes the formation of water-mediated hydrogen bonds involving the 5-OH group of residue E and the 3-OH and 5-OH groups of residue C. In contrast, the (1  3) linkage connecting residues B and D keeps the two residues far apart enough that there is no significant contact. However, the 5-OH of residue D forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the ring oxygen of residue C. Overall, it is notable that although direct intramolecular contacts do not occur between different rings of the carbohydrate, three water-mediated hydrogen bonds connect residue C to residues B, D and E (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. 2). These watermediated interactions appear to stabilize the structure of the core ABCDE pentasaccharide by helping orient the two equivalent non-reducing ends, CE and DF disaccharides, relative to the reducing end, AB disaccharide. The structural complexities of oligofuranosides that are revealed by this study hint at the conformational diversity generated by the combination of flexible glycosidic linkages and ring puckers. The only previous structure determination of a polyar-

abinan in complex with protein showed that overlapping -(1  5)-linked tri-L-arabinofuranosides bound to a bacterial arabinanase in an extended conformation.31 Unfortunately, the low-resolution limit (2.5 Å) of the data and ambiguity in binding orientation prevented definitive assignments of ring puckering and glycosidic torsion angles. Thus, the structures we report here represent the first detailed conformational picture of oligofuranosides when bound to protein.

Discussion
Molecular basis for furanoside-binding specificity in CS-35 One of the most striking features of the mode of oligofuranoside binding seen in CS-35Fab is that the binding pockets for residues A and E of compounds 3 and 4 provide high specificity for Araf residues. The source of this specificity appears to derive from an intricate arrangement of hydrogen-bonding partners and packing interactions. Asn34/L and Asp91/L form a hydrogen-bonding network specific for the 2-OH and 3-OH groups of residue A, whereas His35/H, Ser50/H and Asn58/H combine to form a hydrogen-bonding network specific for the 2-OH and 3-OH groups of residue E. In both cases, the hydrogen-bonding networks and packing interactions in these binding pockets appear to accommodate only vicinal hydroxyl groups with -anticlinal stereochemistry (torsion angles of approximately -95°). The only vicinal hydroxyl groups with a somewhat similar stereochemistry in common, naturally occurring hexopyranoses are the 3-OH and 4OH groups of D-mannopyranose, L-rhamnopyranose and D-glucopyranose and the 2-OH and 3-OH groups of L-fucopyranose. However, the -synclinal stereochemistry of these vicinal hydroxyl groups in hexopyranoses does differ in having smaller torsion angles (approximately -60°), resulting in a decrease of 0.2 Å in distance between the two hydroxyl groups. Perhaps even more important than the details of hydrogen-bonding stereochemistry, the binding of hexopyranoses through vicinal hydroxyl groups in this manner would place the O1 atom and

388 the adjacent glycosidic bond in a position far from that of Araf. The CS-35Fab complexes also suggest that binding specificity arises from the structural features intrinsic to oligofuranosides compared with pyranosides. Obviously, the larger size of the pyranose ring and differing arrangement of hydroxyl groups are expected to interfere with the binding of pyranoses in the pockets for residues A and E. In addition, the combinations of flexible glycosidic linkages and variable ring puckers described above provide arrangements of rings that differ strikingly from those seen in oligopyranosides. For example, the binding pocket for residue E shows a high degree of complementarity for a D-arabinofuranoside with an N-type pucker that is linked through a -(1  2) linkage. This epitope could not be mimicked effectively with more rigid pyranosides. The stereochemical features unique to oligofuranosides are likely exploited by many anti-mycobacterial antibodies, such as CS-35. In support of this hypothesis, CS-35 fails to bind to a wide range of pyranosides in the mammalian glycan array from the Consortium for Functional Glycomics.22 The flexibility of the rings in the bound oligoarabinofuranosides can also be seen by a comparison of the pseudorotational phase (P) angles29,30 of the monosaccharide rings in compounds 3­5 when bound to CS-35Fab with those determined previously for these compounds in solution (Table 3; Supplementary Fig. 1).22 While in some rings (e.g., ring A in compounds 3 and 4) the bound conformation is similar to one of the two conformers present in solution (assuming the standard two-state model),30 in others there are notable differences. In particular, ring B in all three structures adopts a conformation in the bound state that is significantly different from those present in solution. In solution, a mixture of northeastern (P = 49°­64°) and southeastern (P = 121°­124°) conformers is present, whereas in the bound state the ring adopts a northwestern (P = 315°­335°) conformation. Thus, it appears that ring B is a flexible hinge that adopts a conformation that facilitates the binding of other residues, particularly rings A, C and E, to the protein. Differences also exist for residues A and D of compound 5, but in the latter case, this may be a consequence of the relatively weak interaction between these residues and the protein. It is interesting to note that compounds 4 and 5 bind to CS-35Fab in the same manner as the corresponding tetrasaccharides within the context of the branched hexasaccharide 3. Thus, these structures show how three highly flexible oligofuranosides adopt a common core structure that is highly complementary to the antigen-binding site of CS-35. Previous saturation transfer difference (STD)NMR results had suggested that residue F in compound 5 may interact with CS-35Fab in an alternate binding mode,22 but the electron density maps provide no evidence for this. This result appears to indicate that the mode of binding seen

Fab­Oligoarabinofuranoside Crystal Structures

by STD-NMR is not highly populated in the crystalline complexes. The mode of carbohydrate binding seen in our crystal structures also suggests how the capping of Araf residues with mannose residues at the nonreducing end of ManLAM may affect antibody binding. ManLAM is a component of the cell wall of M. tuberculosis in which short D-mannose chains are connected through -(1  2) glycosidic linkages to the residues corresponding to rings E and F in compound 3 or 4.7,10 The presence of these mannose caps appears to enhance survival in macrophages by mediating interactions with the mannose receptor and may also interfere with the binding of antibodies specific for LAM, such as CS-35.21,32 However, the importance of these residues to in vivo mycobacterial pathogenicity has recently been questioned,11 suggesting that the importance previously ascribed to these mannose residues was misplaced. The structures of compounds 3 and 4 bound to CS-35Fab provide a molecular basis for understanding this element of binding specificity. Our crystal structures indicate that short mannose chains connected through -(1  5) glycosidic linkages to residue F would not be expected to affect binding to CS-35 but that the addition of these caps to residue E may reduce binding through negative steric interactions between the protein and the ligand. The 5-OH group of residue E is relatively exposed to solvent, but nearby groups on the surface of CS-35 appear to restrict the conformations allowed for the oligomannose caps. Although our structures offer some insight into the potential effects of mannose caps on antibody recognition, such as the observation that CS-35 binds less well to ManLAM than to LAM,21 a more detailed understanding of how mannose caps affect antibody binding will have to await further structural studies. Structural basis for the design of novel anti-mycobacterial vaccines The crystal structures of LAM fragments bound to CS-35Fab provide a basis for the rational design of novel vaccines. Although the notion of a role for antibody-mediated immunity in protection against tuberculosis is controversial,33­35 previous studies have indicated that protein conjugates of partially degraded LAM demonstrate levels of protection in mice comparable with the BCG vaccine.36 Furthermore, earlier studies also indicated that the administration of purified LAM fractions from M. tuberculosis promoted the resolution of human cases of tuberculosis and leprosy.37­39 The structural information on CS-35Fab binding interactions revealed by our study provides for the first time a molecular-level understanding of how antibodies recognize the immunologically dominant terminal structures found in LAM. Consistent with earlier work using ELISA,21 Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, titration microcalorimetry and STD-NMR, 22 the binding pockets for residues A and E appear to be most

degenerate 3-end primers (Not-HF mix) that anneal to framework region 1 of the antibody.42,43 The VL chain was amplified using a mixture of degenerate 5-end primers (LB mix) annealing to framework region 1 and a set of degenerate 3-end primers (LF mix) that anneal to the constant region of the light chain portion of the antibody. The VH and VL gene fragments generated were 395 and 370 bp, respectively. Each fragment was cloned into pJET1.2 (Fermentas) by blunt-end ligation, and several clones were sequenced. Downstream light-chain sequence was determined by amplifying oligo-dT-primed first-strand cDNA with a sequence-specific forward primer (5-ACT CAG GAG TCC CAT CAA GGT TCA) and oligo(dT)20. Downstream heavy-chain sequence was determined by amplifying cDNA with a sequence-specific forward primer (5-TGA CAA ATG AGG ACT CTG CGG TCT) and oligo(dT)20. Crystallization CS-35Fab was crystallized in the presence of each of the oligosaccharides, 3, 4 and 5, at 293 K by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Lyophilized carbohydrate samples were dissolved with ultrafiltered water (Barnstead) at a concentration of 50 mg/mL. The CS-35Fab­compound 3 complex was initially crystallized as clusters of very thin plates using sparse matrix screens from Hampton Research and QIAGEN. All three complexes were subsequently crystallized under similar conditions after a series of optimization trials. The optimized reservoir solution used for the crystallization of all three complexes was 1.1 M sodium citrate, pH 7.1, 10­70 mM magnesium chloride and 0.05 M trimethylamine-N-oxide. Each oligosaccharide was mixed with CS-35Fab prior to crystallization in the following final concentrations (protein/carbohydrate): compound 3, 0.101 mM/1.12 mM; compound 4, 0.115 mM/1.81 mM; compound 5, 0.113 mM/2.46 mM. A mixture (2 L) of CS-35Fab and each carbohydrate was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and equilibrated against 1 mL of the reservoir solution. After incubation for 2­4 weeks, crystals typically grew to a maximal size of 0.3 mm× 0.2 mm × 0.01 mm as plate clusters. Plate clusters were carefully broken, and the thickest plate crystals were harvested with MicroMesh mounts (Mitegen) prior to flash-cooling and diffraction data measurement. Data collection, structure determination and refinement X-ray diffraction measurements were initially performed using a MAR 345 image plate, and X-rays were produced with a rotating copper anode (Rigaku RUH3R). Higherresolution data were measured using an ADSC Quantum315 CCD detector at beamline 8.3.1 of the Advanced Light Source and at beamline 11-1 of the Stanford Synchrotron Research Laboratory. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL suite,44 and intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes using TRUNCATE in the CCP4 suite.45 The space group was determined to be C2 by autoindexing, data reduction and examining systematic absences. The structures of a murine light chain (PDB ID 1F58) and a murine heavy chain (PDB ID 1E4X) were used as search models for molecular replacement calculations carried out using PHASER.46 Rigid-body refinement and positional/temperature factor refinement were carried out using REFMAC.47 COOT was used for model building.48 Difference electron density maps clearly revealed the conformation of a single carbohydrate molecule bound to

important for providing both binding affinity and specificity for Araf. Complementarity for the branch-point residue B and adjacent residues also appears to be a critical component for binding. These three structural elements would thus appear to comprise a minimal epitope suitable for the design of novel vaccines. Modifications to this minimal epitope, such as the addition of residues C and D, would not be expected to significantly enhance binding affinity to antibodies such as CS-35, since these residues appear to interact only slightly with the protein, although other binding modes may allow for the recognition of the minimal epitope, as well as the C/D branch. Our structures also suggest that CS-35 may interact with additional Araf residues connected through -(1  5)-glycosidic linkages to the reducing end of residue A. Such residues are found in natural LAM and may enhance binding affinity to CS-35. Further studies on the binding of these larger fragments to CS-35, as well as the binding of LAM fragments to other antibodies, are currently in progress.

Materials and Methods
Carbohydrate synthesis The syntheses of compounds 3 and 4 have been described previously.40 Details regarding the synthesis of compound 5 are provided as supplementary information and followed protocols similar to those previously reported for the preparation of other arabinan fragments.41 Protein expression and purification CS-35Fab was produced and purified as described previously,22 with the exception of an additional ionexchange chromatography step. CS-35Fab was further purified by chromatography on HiTrap SP HP (5-mL column, GE Healthcare) by linear and step gradients with buffer I (0.02 M NaHepes, pH 7.0, 0.02 M NaCl and 5 g/100 mL of glycerol) and buffer II (0.02 M NaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl and 5 g/100 mL of glycerol). CS-35Fab was dialyzed into 10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and concentrated to 5.5 mg/mL using Vivaspin 15R centrifugal concentrators (5000 MWCO, Vivascience). Nucleic acid sequencing VH (variable region of the heavy chain) and VL (variable region of the light chain) were cloned and sequenced by reverse transcriptase PCR. The first-strand cDNA synthesis of CS-35 antibody was performed using the SuperScript III CellsDirect cDNA Synthesis System (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, starting directly from approximately 8000 frozen CS-35 antibody-producing hybridoma cells. The first-strand cDNA was used directly as a template for light- and heavy-chain amplifications using PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). The VH chain was amplified using a mixture of degenerate 5-end primers (CLHB mix) annealing to the constant region of the heavy chain portion and a set of

a single molecule of CS-35Fab in the asymmetric unit. Additional rounds of refinement and model building were performed using stereochemical restraints for the carbohydrate derived from previous crystallographic studies.49,50 Only bond-length and bond-angle parameters, as well as the chirality of carbon atoms, were included as conformational restraints during refinement. Torsion angles and ring puckering parameters were not explicitly restrained at any point of the refinement. The geometric parameters of the model were monitored throughout the course of refinement using MOLPROBITY51 and PROCHECK.52 Data quality and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Molecular graphics figures were prepared with PyMOL.53 Accession numbers The coordinates and structure factors for the complexes of CS-35Fab bound to compounds 3, 4 and 5 have been deposited in the PDB under accession codes 3HNS, 3HNT and 3HNV, respectively.
