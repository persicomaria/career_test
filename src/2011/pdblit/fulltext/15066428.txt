Upon induction of a bacteriophage l lysogen, a site-specific recombination reaction excises the phage genome from the chromosome of its bacterial host. A critical regulator of this process is the phage-encoded excisionase (Xis) protein, which functions both as a DNA architectural factor and by cooperatively recruiting integrase to an adjacent binding site specifically required for excision. Here we present the three-dimensional structure of Xis and the results of a structure-based mutagenesis study to define the molecular basis of its function. Xis adopts an unusual "winged"-helix motif that is modeled to interact with the major- and minor-grooves of its binding site through a single a-helix and loop structure ("wing"), respectively. The C-terminal tail of Xis, which is required for cooperative binding with integrase, is unstructured in the absence of DNA. We propose that asymmetric bending of DNA by Xis positions its unstructured C-terminal tail for direct contacts with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of integrase and that an ensuing disordered to ordered transition of the tail may act to stabilize the formation of the tripartite integrase ­Xis ­ DNA complex required for phage excision.

Introduction
Bacteriophage l integrates into and excises from the Escherichia coli chromosome by exquisitely regulated site-specific DNA recombination reactions.1,2 Integration between the phage recombination attachment site (attP ) and a specific site on the bacterial chromosome (attB ) generates the hybrid recombination sites attL and attR at the phage-host DNA junction (Figure 1(a)). Under the appropriate inducing signals, recombination between attR and attL regenerates an excised circular l chromosome and the attB site on the bacterial chromosome. Although each attachment site contains identical 15 base pair "core-type" sequences

that are recombined by the phage-encoded integrase (Int),3,4 the directionality of recombination is controlled by protein binding to adjacently located sites within the P and P0 arms. The latter interactions promote the assembly of distinct higher-order nucleoprotein complexes, called "intasomes", where the excisive and integrative recombination reactions transpire. Integrative recombination requires Int5 and the E. coli-encoded integration host factor (IHF),6,7 while excisive recombination requires the phage-encoded excisionase (Xis) protein in addition to Int and IHF.8,9 In addition, the host-encoded factor for inversion stimulation (Fis) is required for efficient excision in vivo and at limiting concentrations of Xis in vitro.10,11 Xis orchestrates the assembly of the excisive intasome,12 ­ 16 while simultaneously inhibiting viral integration by converting attP into a catalytically inactive structure.17 ­ 19 Xis elicits its function by binding to the P arm, which contains seven binding sites for four proteins (Figure 1(b)):

Structure of l Xis

Figure 1. Schematic of sitespecific l recombination reactions. (a) Integration of the supercoiled phage DNA into the bacterial chromosome occurs between the 240 bp attP (COC0 ) and 20 bp attB (BOB0 ), respectively. Integrative recombination results in the prophage DNA flanked by the recombinant products attL (BOC0 ) and attR (COB0 ). Integration requires the phage-encoded Int protein, and the host-encoded protein IHF. The excision reaction, in which attL and attR recombine to form attP and attB, requires an additional phageencoded protein Xis and is strongly stimulated in vivo by the hostencoded protein Fis. Fis has a modest stimulatory effect on integration in vivo. (b) Protein binding sites on attL and attR. Formation of an excisive intasome requires Int bound to four of the five "armtype" sites, P0 1, P0 2, P0 3, and P2, as well as to the "core-type" sequences, BOC0 and COB0 , where both cleavage and strand exchange take place. Excision also requires the binding of IHF to two of its three sites, H2 and H0 . Binding of Int to P1 and IHF to H1 is required for integration but dispensable for excision. Xis binds cooperatively to adjacent 13 bp sites, X1 and X2, while Fis binds to site F, which overlaps and occludes Xis binding to X2.1

(1) Int binds to the P1 and P2 sites through its amino-terminal DNA-binding domain,20 (2) IHF binds to the H1 and H2 sites,21 (3) Xis cooperatively binds to sites X1 and X2,17,22 or alternatively, (4) Fis interacts with site F, which overlaps X2, and cooperatively associates with Xis bound to X1.10 Xis regulates the directionality of recombination in two ways. First, DNA bending by Xis alters the trajectory of attR DNA within the excisive intasome, thereby stabilizing the synaptic complex in which attL and attR are bridged by bivalent DNA-binding Int proteins.14 Specifically, gel electrophoresis studies are consistent with Xis introducing bends of 45 ­908 when bound to its individual sites, and complexes containing Xis bound to X1 and X2 or Xis bound to X1 and Fis bound to F have been estimated to contain over 1408 of DNA curvature.23 In addition to its important architectural role, Xis cooperatively recruits Int to site P217 through interactions at its C-terminus.24,25 The combination of DNA bending and protein-protein interactions are believed to position the C-terminal end of Int appropriately for target capture and catalysis within a fully assembled excisive intasome. The three-dimensional structures of nearly all components of the phage l recombination system have now been determined,26 ­ 30 but a molecular understanding of how Xis regulates the directionality of recombination has remained elusive, since it does not display a significant relationship to any protein of known structure at the primary sequence level. Here we present the three-dimen-

sional structure of the Xis protein and the results of a structure-based mutagenesis study. Xis adopts an unusual "winged"-helix motif that presumably interacts with the major and minor grooves of its DNA-binding site through a single a-helix and loop structure ("wing"), respectively. Surprisingly, we find that the C-terminal end of Xis, which is required for cooperative interactions with Int, is unstructured in the absence of Int and DNA. The structure and targeted mutagenesis of Xis enables a model for the Xis ­DNA complex to be constructed, providing new insights into Xismediated distortion of DNA structure and its recruitment of Int during phage excision.

Results
Defining the minimal structured domain of Xis In order to determine the molecular structure of Xis, we overexpressed and purified uniformly carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 enriched full length Xis (residues Met1 to Ser72, Mw , 8.6 kDa) and assigned its backbone atoms using conventional two (2D) and three (3D)-dimensional heteronuclear techniques. The results of this analysis suggest that amino acids located at the C-terminal end of the protein are mobile in solution, since they exhibit narrow line widths and negative 15N-{1H} heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) (Figure 2(a)). Specifically, the data indicate that amino acids Leu5 through Asp51 are structured

(heteronuclear NOEs greater than 0.4), while residues Leu52 to Ser72 at the C-terminal end of the polypeptide are unstructured (small magnitude or negative heteronuclear NOEs). The dynamic behavior of Met1 to Thr4 can not be determined because their backbone amide resonances are absent or too weak in intensity. We conclude from this data that residues Leu5 (and possibly Met1 to Thr4) to Asp51 form the minimum structured domain of Xis in the DNA free state. Although the NMR spectra of wild-type fulllength Xis are well dispersed (Figure 2(b)), its structural analysis by NMR proved challenging, since Xis is insoluble above , 750 mM (in 50 mM NaPO4 (pH 6.0) and 100 mM NaCl), forms disulfide-linked dimers through its single Cys28 residue, and exhibits resonance overlap from the sharp resonances of the 21 unstructured amino acids at its C-terminal end. Moreover, the full length Xis protein exhibited unusually fast nitrogen-15 relaxation rates for a protein of its molecular size (an average 15N T2 value of 78.3(^ 9.8) ms for residues Leu5 to Val50), and resonances for several backbone amides were either weak or absent in the NMR spectra (Met1 to Thr4 and His44 to Ser46). Ultra-centrifugation studies indicate that Xis is predominantly monomeric in solution, but forms ill-defined higherorder aggregates at millimolar concentrations (data not shown) leading to its anomalous NMR relaxation behavior. Since it has previously been shown that the C-terminal tail of Xis is not required for DNA-binding24 and is structurally disordered (Figure 2(a)), we over-expressed, labeled, and purified residues Met1 to Pro55 of Xis harboring a Cys28Ser mutation (1 ­ 55XisC28S). A comparison of the 1H ­ 15N HSQC spectrum of full-length Xis and 1 ­ 55XisC28S proteins (Figure 2(b) and (c), respectively) and an inspection of their respective NOESY data (not shown) reveal no significant differences, indicating that 1 ­ 55XisC28S adopts a similar three-dimensional structure as the full-length protein.

This data and T2 relaxation time measurements (data not shown) indicate that the C-terminal 21 residues of Xis are unstructured in the absence of Int and/or DNA.

To determine whether 1 ­ 55XisC28S is biologically active, we tested its ability to bind attR and promote phage excision. The DNA-binding properties of 1 ­ 55XisC28S were compared with full length Xis (Xiswt) using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Xiswt binds cooperatively to attR

and line widths of residues Met1 to Pro55 within each peptide fragment are nearly identical, indicating that they adopt a similar three-dimensional structure. The spectrum of each protein was assigned completely with the exception of Met1, Tyr2, and Thr4 from 1 ­ 55XisC28S, and Met1, Tyr2, Leu3, Thr4, His44, and Glu45 from fulllength Xis. The resonance assignments of 1 ­ 55XisC28S are displayed in (c).

results in a slower migrating complex (lanes 5 ­ 6) with a Kd of 39 nM, which represents cooperative binding of Fis at F and Xis at X1.10,31 1 ­ 55XisC28S binds attR in a similar manner as full length Xis, although its binding affinity is enhanced. As shown in Figure 3(a), 1 ­ 55XisC28S alone binds to attR cooperatively with a Kd of 25(^ 3) nM for the X1X2 complex (lanes 7 and 8) and cooperates with Fis to form an X1F complex (lane 10; Kd ¼ 9.4(^ 0.4) nM). Whereas Int binding to P2 exhibits strong cooperativity with Xiswt,17 1 ­ 55 XisC28S is unable to recruit Int to P2 (data not shown). This was evaluated using the N-terminal Int arm site DNA-binding domain (1 ­ 64Int), which contains the determinant for cooperative binding with Xis.71,72 The inability to stimulate Int binding is consistent with earlier studies showing that the C-terminal 19 residues mediate loading of Int onto site P2.24,25 The ability of 1 ­ 55Xis to stimulate phage l excision was evaluated in vivo by measuring yields of lcI857 xisam phage after induction in the presence of wild-type or mutant Xis expressed on a plasmid from the PBAD promoter.32 The presence of 1 ­ 55Xis results in a 2000-fold increase in phage

yields when compared to yields in the absence of Xis (Figure 3(b)). While this stimulation is 400-fold less than that obtained with wild-type Xis, it indicates that the DNA-binding activity of the truncated form is sufficient to promote substantial excision in the absence of cooperative interactions with Int. The ability of C-terminal mutants of Xis to stimulate excision of a prophage inserted into the galT gene has been noted previously.24,25 Introduction of the Cys28Ser mutation into both 1 ­ 55Xis and full-length Xis results in a small decrease in phage excision in vivo, but does not significantly affect its in vitro binding properties (Figure 3(b), Tables 1 and 2). We suspect that the reduced in vivo activities in the presence of C28S reflects the lower intracellular amount of this protein that was observed by immunoblotting (see Materials and Methods). We conclude that the truncated and mutated 1 ­ 55 XisC28S protein can effectively function as an architectural factor by cooperatively interacting with itself and with the Fis protein on attR. Information about its three-dimensional structure and mechanism of DNA-binding should therefore provide insights into Xis function in recombination. Structure determination of

The 1 ­ 55XisC28S protein adopts an unusual "winged"-helix structure that is formed by two a-helices (a1, residues Leu5-Ala10; a2, residues Leu18-Glu27), which are packed against two extended strands (Figure 4(b)). The helices are separated by an ordered seven residue turn (T, residues Arg11-Ser17) and are positioned approximately orthogonal to one another (, 1018) to generate an L-shaped structure. Immediately following helix a2, the peptide chain adopts an extended strand conformation (S1, residues Ser28 to Pro34), before leading into a two stranded anti-parallel b-sheet (b1, residues Val35 to Lys36; b2, residues Tyr41 to Leu42) whose strands are connected by a four residue reverse turn ("wing") (W, residues Asp37-Glu40). Strand S2 (S2, residues Phe43 to Val50) then follows the sheet and is situated directly adjacent to strand S1, with only a single inter-strand hydrogen bond stabilizing their positioning; solvent exchange and NOE data indicate that the amide proton of Phe31 (strand S1) is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Val48 (strand S2). Amino acids within strands S1 and S2 adopt an irregular structure, largely due to

The modest hydrophobic core of the protein is formed by the side chains of: Leu5, Trp8, and Asn9 from helix a1, Leu18, Thr20, Val21 and Trp24 from helix a2, and Ile30, Pro34, Phe43, Ala47 from extended strands, S1 and S2 (Figure 4(c)). Characterization of Xis mutants containing changes within the N-terminal domain Surface exposed residues within the N-terminal structured domain of Xis were targeted for mutagenesis to identify functionally important regions. Positions where mutations exist from previous studies were not changed, although the properties of relevant mutants are mentioned along with the current set. Each Xis mutant was tested for its ability to stimulate excision of lcI857 xisam phage in vivo by measuring phage yields after induction from both fis þ and fis mutant cells (Table 2). Phage

yields in the absence of Fis were reduced 1800fold over fis þ levels because of the absence of Fis ­ Xis cooperativity at attR.10,11 A subset of mutants were purified and their DNA-binding properties compared with wild-type Xis for binding to an isolated X1 binding site and for formation of the X1X2 and X1F complexes on attR (Figure 5 and Table 1). The results reveal two distinct DNAbinding surfaces on Xis that are critical for its ability to stimulate excision. One DNA-binding surface is defined by mutations within helix a2. An alanine residue substitution at Arg22 (Figure 6(a)) caused the most severe phenotype of the mutations studied. R22A displayed at least a 1000-fold reduction in phage yields in both fis þ and fis mutant cells (Table 2) and did not generate detectable complexes with attR either alone or in the presence of Fis (Figure 5(b), Table 1). Gardner and co-workers have reported that alanine residue substitutions at residues Glu19, Arg23, Arg26, and Glu27 (Figure 6(a)) are also strongly defective in DNA binding.33

In all panels, lanes 1 ­ 4 represent the wild-type controls for the experiment performed along with each mutant. Fis (2.2 nM) and wild-type Xis (143 nM) are added as denoted in lanes 1 ­ 4, with the exception of (c). In (c), 8.8 nM Fis is added, which results in an additional slower migrating secondary Fis-attR complex, as seen in lane 2. F31A (in (g)) is included as an example of a mutant with relatively normal binding properties. Arrows indicate the positions of relevant complexes as described in Figure 3.

Thus, the available mutation data strongly indicate that helix a2 is a critical determinant for DNAbinding. Extending from helix a2 toward helix a1 is a highly basic loop that includes residues Arg16, Arg14, Arg13, and Arg11 (Figure 6(a) and (b)). The R16A mutant exhibited significantly reduced excision in vivo and bound attR poorly with little,

if any, specificity (Tables 1 and 2). A ladder of non-specific complexes were formed by R16A on the X1 or attR probes that was similar in apparent affinity to non-specific complexes formed on a random pBR322 fragment (Figure 5(c) and data not shown). By contrast, R11A, R13A, and R14A did not exhibit significantly impaired excision in vivo (Table 2) and formed specific X1 or X1X2

(b) Electrostatic surface potential of 1 ­ 55 XisC28S. Basic regions are colored blue, and acidic regions are colored red. The orientation of the molecule is similar to that in (a). The figure was prepared using the program GRASP.68 (c) Model of the 1 ­ 55 XisC28S protein bound to the X1 site. Xis is positioned such that helix a2 sits within the major groove and the wing inserts into the adjacent minor groove. The DNA sequence of both the P2 and X1 sites is shown below the model and is numbered relative to the attR core.1 Bases implicated in Xis binding by methylation protection 22 are highlighted in magenta with orange spheres, where the orange spheres represent the N7 atom of guanine 296 and the N3 atoms of adenines 288 and 289. Additionally, base pairs implicated in Xis binding by mutagenesis31 are highlighted in magenta. All other bases comprising the X1 site are colored cyan. Pyrimidine ­ purine steps in the P2X1 region are indicated by green underlines. (d) Model of the N-terminal arm DNA-binding domain of Int (1 ­ 64Int) with 1 ­ 55XisC28S. 1 ­ 55XisC28S is modeled bound to X1 as in panel C with 1 ­ 64Int positioned over the central TGA trinucleotide of the P2 site as described.69 The orientation of 1 ­ 64Int when bound at P2 is not known and thus is arbitrarily depicted in this Figure. The a-helix of 1 ­ 64 Int is depicted in yellow, and the three b-strands of 1 ­ 64Int are colored blue. Note that the C-terminal end of Xis, which is disordered in solution, is located adjacent to the arm binding domain of Int, consistent with existing genetic and biochemical data.24,25

complexes with affinities that were not significantly different from wild-type (Table 1). The affinities of the X1F complexes were reduced in the case of R11A and R14A, which may be correlated with the small decrease in phage yields observed in fis þ cells by these mutants. The most notable feature of these mutants, especially R13A and R14A, is that the X1, X1X2, and to a lesser extent X1F complexes migrated faster than those formed by wild-type (e.g., compare the position of the X1X2 complex assembled with R13A in Figure 5(d) lanes 6 and 7 with that generated by wild-type Xis in lane 3). The migrations of the mutant Xis and Xis ­ Fis complexes assembled on an identical size probe with the X1X2F region located at one end of the DNA fragment were indistinguishable from those assembled with wild-type (data not shown). Therefore, the faster mobilities observed with the standard attR probe, where the X1X2F region is

located near the center, are consistent with reduced DNA curvature induced by the mutants. Xis mutants K36A, D37A, and R39A, containing changes within the wing (Figure 6(a)), define a second region involved in DNA-binding. Each mutant gave markedly reduced frequencies of in vivo excision, particularly in the absence of Fis (Table 2). These mutants formed a ladder of nonspecific complexes on the X1 probe in vitro that was similar to those formed with the non-specific pBR322 probe. K36A (Figure 5(e)) and R39A (data not shown) formed a non-discrete complex on attR that began in the location of an X1X2 complex and decreased in mobility with additional protein. In the presence of Fis, K36A and R39A formed a X1F complex that migrated equivalently to wildtype, although ^ 10 times more Xis was required. On the other hand, D37A bound non-specifically to attR with or without Fis (Figure 5(f)). Thus, the

Figure 7. The Xis protein is related to the "winged"-helix family of DNA-binding domains. (a) The structure of the 1 ­ 55XisC28S protein and (b) the DNA-binding domain from the Mu repressor protein (MuR-DBD).34 Both proteins contain structurally conserved alpha helices (colored red), which are packed against two extended strands (colored blue). In the MuR-DBD:DNA complex, helix a2 and the loop connecting strands B2 and B3 (the "wing") plays an important role in DNA-binding.35 The structure of the MuR-DBD is distinguished by the presence of an additional beta-strand and alphahelix (colored magenta). Analysis with the program DALI70 indicates that the proteins are related with a z score ¼ 2.4, where z , 2 is considered to be structurally unrelated. The coordinates of the backbone atoms of 1 ­ 55 ° XisC28S (residues 5­ 50) and MuR (residues Pro19-Ser64) can be superimposed with a rmsd of 3.7 A.

in vitro binding properties are consistent with the excision defects exhibited by these mutants; D37A is the most severe in both the presence and absence of Fis, while K36A and R39A have a less severe phenotype when Fis is present. Gardner and coworkers reported that E40A also displayed impaired specificity of binding, although it could promote excision and cooperate with Fis in vivo.33 These data suggest an important role for the wing in sequence-specific binding to attR.

Model of Xis binding to X1 We propose that Xis binds to the X1 and X2 sites within attR by inserting helix a2 into the major groove, and those residues within the wing contact the adjacent minor groove or phosphodiester backbone (Figure 6(c)). This orientation places the two positively charged surfaces on Xis at the DNA interface (Figure 6(b)). These surfaces include an extended basic region formed by residues within helix a2 and the preceding arginine-rich loop, and a second localized basic region formed by residues Lys36 and Arg39 near the end of the wing (Figure 6(b)). In order to account for the 45 ­908 curvature introduced by Xis binding to a single site,23 we further propose that the DNA is dynamically wrapped around Xis such that it follows the basic surface specified primarily by the arginine-rich loop between helix a1 and a2 (Figure 6(a) ­ (c)). This mode of binding is consistent with the recently determined solution structure of the MuR-DBD:DNA complex,35 in which helix a2 (the analog to helix a2 in Xis) is inserted into the major groove, while the loop analogous to the turn connecting b strands b1 and b2 is immobilized within the minor groove. The location of Xis helix a2 within the Xis recognition sequence is consistent with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) protection and interference experiments performed by Yin et al., which implicate the N7 position of guanines at 2 96 in X1 and 2 76 in X2 as being in close contact with Xis in the DNA complex.22 It thus seems likely that this portion of the binding site serves as the major groove interface with Xis, a conclusion consistent with the fact that base pair changes at positions 2 93, 2 95 and 2 96 in X1 abrogate binding.25 The Xis mutagenesis data also strongly support the placement of helix a2 at the DNA interface. Alanine residue substitutions of Arg22, Arg23, and Arg26 within helix a2, which are

Discussion
The Xis protein regulates the directionality of recombination by altering the trajectory of attR DNA within the excisive intasome, and by cooperatively recruiting Int to site P2. The functional properties of 1 ­ 55XisC28S, combined with previous genetic analysis by Gardner and co-workers,24,33 localizes the Xis DNA-binding domain to residues Met1 to Pro55. The NMR structure indicates that these amino acids adopt a fold reminiscent of the "winged"-helix proteins, being most closely related to the Mu bacteriophage repressor DNA-binding domain (MuR-DBD) (Figure 7;34). Both Xis and MuR-DBD contain two contiguous a-helices that pack against two extended strands. However, in MuR-DBD this basic fold is further elaborated by an additional C-terminal a-helix and N-terminal b-strand. The relationship between Xis and the MuR-DBD is not recognizable at the primary sequence level, as residues Met1 to Pro55 of Xis and Lys13 to Thr81 of MuR-DBD share only 19.4% sequence identity. However, their structural similarity, together with the properties of mutant Xis proteins, enables a plausible model of the Xis ­DNA complex to be constructed.

positioned to contact bases or phosphate groups within the major groove, essentially abolish DNAbinding in the absence of cooperative interactions with Fis; loss of Arg22 eliminates detectable binding even in the presence of Fis (Table 1, Figure 5(b);33). The model also accounts for the Xismediated DMS protections within the minor groove N3 atoms of 2 88 and 2 89 within X1 (or 2 68 within X2).22 Residues Lys36, Asp37, Arg39, and Glu40, which reside within the wing that is predicted to be contacting the minor groove in this region, all strongly affect Xis binding affinity and specificity. The DNA-binding properties of mutants containing alanine residue substitutions in the arginine-rich loop between helix a1 and a2 (Arg11, 13, 14, 16) provide evidence for the asymmetric bending of DNA around this side of Xis. Loss of Arg16 has a severe effect on binding, whereas R11A, R13A and R14A all form attR specific complexes. However, R13A and R14A, and to a smaller extent R11A, exhibit a faster mobility than wild-type Xis complexes when bound at the center of a DNA fragment, suggesting a reduction in Xis-induced DNA curvature. It is interesting to note that the DNA sequence over much of the X1 and X2 binding sites extending towards the P2 Int binding site consists of pyrimidine ­ purine base pair steps (Figure 6(c)), which are known to be easily distorted due to the nature of their stacking.36,37 Recruitment of Int by Xis In addition to reorienting the path of DNA, Xis controls the directionality of recombination by enhancing Int binding to the P2 site. This occurs through a direct protein-protein interaction involving the C-terminal end of Xis24,25 and the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of Int.71,72 To gain clues into the molecular nature of Xis ­Int binding cooperativity, the recently determined solution structure of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of Int (1 ­ 64Int, residues 1 to 64 of Int)29 was docked onto the P2 site of the 1 ­ 55XisC28S ­DNA model (Figure 6(d)). The 1 ­ 64Int domain is believed to recognize the P2 site through a three-stranded b-sheet, a mode of binding that is consistent with the structure of the DNA complex of the related integrase protein from the Tn916 transposon.29,38 The model of the 1 ­ 55XisC28S:1 ­ 64Int:DNA ternary complex positions the C-terminal end of Xis immediately adjacent to 1 ­ 64Int. Whereas our NMR data indicates that residues beyond Leu52 are disordered in solution (Figure 2(a)), residues Gly59 to Arg65 of Xis have a strong propensity to form an a-helix, and residues that would reside on one side of this putative helix have been shown to be critical for Int cooperativity.25 Winged-helix proteins commonly have a third a-helix at their C-terminal end (e.g., the Mu repressor DBD, Figure 7(b)) that would correspond to the putative C-terminal a-helix on Xis. We suggest that this a-helix folds upon interaction with Int and/or

DNA. Although the model of the ternary complex does not provide details about the molecular basis of cooperativity and DNA-binding by these proteins, it does provide an important structural framework in which to guide biochemical studies of this interaction. Xis ­ Xis and Xis ­Fis cooperativity within attR A single Xis protomer interacts with DNA with low affinity and specificity (Table 1). In vivo, Xis relies on Fis to efficiently target it to attR, whereas cooperative binding of two Xis protomers to X1 and X2 can promote efficient excision in vitro. Model building predicts that Xis protomers will bind to X1 and X2 on the same side of the DNA helix.22 However, in contrast with the situation with Int, the X1 and X2 bound Xis protomers are not positioned immediately adjacent to one another, implying that a mechanism for cooperative binding involving a direct contact between Xis protomers will require additional bending of DNA between sites X1 and X2. An even more extensive bend may be required if protein-protein interactions mediate positive cooperative binding of the Xis and Fis proteins, since a greater distance separates sites X1 and F. At present, the mode of cooperative binding between Xis and Fis remains unknown, since surface mutagenesis thus far has failed to identify residues within either protein that behave as expected for Xis ­ Xis or Xis ­ Fis* contact sites24 (this paper; S. Cramton & R.C.J., unpublished). A mechanism involving changes in DNA structure that are transmitted along the DNA helix has recently been shown to influence binding cooperativity in the page Tn7 transposition reaction.73 It is possible that a similar mechanism may operate at attR. A recent survey classified 63 different excisionases or "recombination directionality" proteins in the database into at least seven groups.39 The present report on l Xis represents the first structure of a Xis protein from any of these groups, revealing an unusual "winged"-helix protein fold. With the determination of the l Xis structure, nearly all of the individual proteins or domains in the l site-specific recombination system have now been elucidated, laying the structural foundation needed for future studies to determine how these separate components collaborate in the assembly of higher-order complexes that are competent for directional recombination.

Materials and Methods
Construction of Xis plasmids The wild-type xis gene was cloned into pET11a (Novagen) by PCR from lcI857 S7, and the rare arginine codons encoding residues 13 and 16 were converted to CGC, using a two-step PCR protocol to form pRJ1717.40 Mutations generating alanine or other amino acid residue substitutions at specific positions were generated

802
in pRJ1717 as was the 30 truncated gene encoding amino acids 1­ 55 (pRJ1709). For in vivo assays the wild-type and mutant xis genes were transferred into pBAD3332 using the common HindIII and Xba I sites.

Structure of l Xis

Purification of Xis Full length wild-type and mutant Xis proteins were purified from RJ3386 (BL21 (DE3) endA8 < tc ) containing pSBET (p15A cat argU þ;41) and pRJ1717 or its mutant derivatives. Cells were typically grown in M9 media42 with 0.2% glucose to an A600 nm of 0.7 at 37 8C and induced with 1 mM IPTG for 60 minutes. Cells for labeled Xis were grown in A media42 containing 0.1% 15 N ammonium sulfate and 0.15% 13C glucose. The harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris ­HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 15 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.1 mM benzamidine in a volume five times the pellet weight and disrupted using a French press. The cleared lysate obtained after centrifugation at 15,000g for 30 minutes at 4 8C was adjusted to 1 M NaCl, and the DNA was removed by precipitation with approximately 0.33% (w/v) polyethyleneimine (ICN). Ammonium sulfate was then added to 30% saturation (0 8C) and the precipitated material containing Xis was collected after 3 h on ice by centrifugation at 15,000g for 30 minutes. The pellet was solubilized in buffer A (50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.2 M NaCl, 2 M urea, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT) and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing in the same buffer, Xis was eluted with 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing Xis were pooled, diluted to 0.2 M NaCl and subjected to FPLC chromatography on a Resourse S or Mono S column (Amersham Pharmacia) that was developed with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. Some mutant preparations were further subjected to HPLC chromatography on a C4 reverse phase column (Waters) developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Equivalent specific activities of attR binding were obtained for Xis preparations before and after the C4 chromatography step. Xis was stored at 2 20 8C in 50% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA and 10 mM DTT. Mutant Xis preparations were judged to be at least 90% pure by coomassie blue stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Xis concentrations were determined by extrapolation from known amounts of lysozyme that were electrophoresed in parallel. No contaminating protein was detectable in the Xiswt samples used for NMR. 15 N- or 15N- and 13C-labeled preparations of 1 ­ 55XisC28S for NMR were expressed from pRJ1709 in RJ3386 as described above except that the cells were induced at an A600 of 0.3. The cells were resuspended in 50 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM NaCl, 10% glucose, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM benzamidine, and 2 mM PMSF and lysed by sonication. The cleared extract was precipitated with ammonium sulfate to 45% saturation (0 8C), where 1 ­ 55XisC28S was present in the pellet. The pellet was solubilized in a minimal volume of 50 mM NaPO4 (pH 6.0), 2 M urea, and 300 mM NaCl and applied to a Sephacryl-S100 (Amersham Pharmacia) size exclusion column. Fractions containing 1 ­ 55XisC28S were pooled and dialyzed into a buffer containing 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 2 M urea, and 50 mM NaCl and applied to an FPLC Resource

S column.1 ­ 55XisC28S was eluted with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1 M NaCl in the same buffer and was free of detectable contaminating proteins by coomassie blue stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Pure protein was then dialyzed and concentrated by lyophilization. Samples used for NMR consisted of approximately 1 mM 1 ­ 55 XisC28S in 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and 100 mM NaCl. In vivo l excision assays l xis am lysogens were constructed by infecting lY124 (cI857 xis1 ) phage (obtained from R. Weisberg, NIH) into RJ1174 (F0 proAB lacI q,ZU118 D(lac-pro ) ara rpsL ) and RJ1733 (RJ1174 fis < kan-767 ) and the presence of a single prophage at attR was confirmed by PCR.43 The fis þ and fis mutant lY124 lysogens were transformed with pBAD33 carrying either wild-type or mutant forms of xis. Cells were grown in superbroth 44 containing chloramphenicol (12.5 mg/ml) at 30 8C to an A600 nm of 0.4 and shifted to 42 8C together with addition of 0.2% L -(þ )-arabinose (Sigma) to induce Xis synthesis. After 30 min cultures were shifted back to 37 8C, and phage yields (plaque forming units) were measured after an additional 2.5 h. Intracellular Xis levels present after 15 min of induction (RJ1174 background) for a subset of the mutants including all that exhibited reduced phage yields were assessed by immunoblotting using Xis antisera generously provided by Howard Nash (NIH). With the exception of C28S, none of the mutant phenotypes could be explained by reduced Xis levels. For unknown reasons, C28S consistently displayed lower expression levels. In vitro DNA-binding assays DNA-binding by Xis mutants in the absence or presence of Fis was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using 32P-end labeled probes generated by PCR. The 135 bp X1 probe was obtained from pRJ1678, which contains the X1 binding site plus 10 bp of flanking l DNA (AGTGACTGCATATGTTGTGTTTTACAGTATTAT) cloned between the Bam H1 and Sac I sites of pUC18. The 262 bp attR probe was derived from pJT175 (gift of J. Thompson & A. Landy) and was amplified such that the X1X2/F region was 121 bp and 101 bp from each end. To measure effects of protein-induced DNA bending, an attR probe of the same size but with the end 23 bp from the X1 boundary was used. A nonspecific DNA probe was generated from bp 376 to 733 of pBR322. Approximately 70 fmol probe was incubated at 23 8C with varying amounts of Xis and Fis, as appropriate, in 20 ml binding buffer containing 20 mM Tris ­ HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mg/ ml BSA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Amersham Pharmacia). After 10 min, the samples were applied to a 5% acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (59:1) gel in 45 mM Tris ­ borate EDTA buffer and electrophoresed at 5 V/cm. The percent of the labeled DNA bound was determined by phosphorimaging, and Kd values were calculated as described;45 Table 1 reports the average of at least three independent trials. NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K on Bruker DRX 500 and 600 MHz spectrometers equipped

with xyz-gradient triple-resonance probes. Protein resonances (1H,15N, and 13C) were assigned using threedimensional (3D) HNCO, HNCOCA,46 HNCACB,47 HCACO,48 CBCA(CO)NH,49 HCCH total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY);50 HCCH COSY,51 HNHA,53 and 15 N-edited TOCSY experiments.52 The program TALOS was utilized to obtain restraints for the backbone f and c dihedral angles, with the ranges of these restraints set to either two-times the standard deviation of the predicted value or to ^ 308, whichever number was larger. The side chain dihedral angles x1 and x2 were determined using 3D HNHB54, 15N-edited ROESY, 13C-edited ROESY,55 3D HN(CO)C, 13Cgaromatic 15N- or 13C0 spin echo difference HSQC, 13C0 - or 15N ­ 13Cg spin echo difference constant-time (CT)-HSQC, and long range 13C ­ 13C correlation spectra. Distant restraints were obtained from 3D 15 N-edited NOESY, 3D 13C-edited NOESY,56 and 4D 13 C ­ 15N-edited NOESY experiments (mixing times: 150 ms, 100 ms, and 120 ms, respectively).57 Spectra were processed using NMRPipe58 and analyzed using NMR View.59 Structure calculations Structures of 1 ­ 55XisC28S were calculated using the program XPLOR60 modified to include terms for 3JHNa couplings,61 13Ca and 13Cb chemical shifts, and conformational database refinement.62 Distance restraints were ° ° grouped into three ranges: 1.8 ­ 2.7 A (1.8­ 2.9 A for ° distances involving 15N-bound protons), 1.8 ­ 3.3 A ° for distances involving 15N-bound protons), (1.8­ 3.5 A ° ° and 1.8­ 5.0 A. 0.5 A was added to the upper limit of distance restraints involving methyl protons to account for the increased apparent intensities of methyl resonances. Distances involving methyl protons, aromatic ring protons, and non-stereospecifically assigned methylene protons were represented as a (Sr 6)21/6 sum.63 Hydrogen bond restraints were introduced at the final stages of refinement and were determined from amide proton exchange experiments and through an analysis of the NOE data. The structures were calculated using hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing (DGSA) protocols,64 followed by an additional simulated annealing step on each of the initial DGSA structures. Details of the calculation protocol have been described previously.65 The program PROCHECK (version 3.4.4) was used to evaluate the final ensemble of conformers 66 . The DNA used in the models in Figure 6 was generated with Insight II software (Accelrys, Inc.) and contained primarily roll angle deviations introduced into the DNA structure. The figures were prepared using the program MOLMOL.67 The structure of 1 ­ 55 XisC28S has been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1LX8).
