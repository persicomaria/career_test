Crystal Structures of Urtica dioica Agglutinin and its Complex with Tri-N-acetylchitotriose
Kazuaki Harata* and Michiro Muraki
Biomolecules Department National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology 1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8566, Japan Urtica dioica agglutinin is a small plant lectin that binds chitin. We puri®ed the isolectin VI (UDA-VI) and crystal structures of the isolectin and its complex with tri-N-acetylchitotriose (NAG3) were determined by X-ray analysis. The UDA-VI consists of two domains analogous to hevein and the backbone folding of each domain is maintained by four disul®de bridges. The sequence similarity of the two domains is not high (42 %) but their backbone structures are well superimposed except some loop regions. The chitin binding sites are located on the molecular surface at both ends of the dumbbell-shape molecule. The crystal of the NAG3 complex contains two independent molecules forming a protein-sugar 2:2 complex. One NAG3 molecule is sandwiched between two independent UDA-VI molecules and the other sugar molecule is also sandwiched by one UDA-VI molecule and symmetry-related another one. The sugar binding site of N-terminal domain consists of three subsites accommodating NAG3 while two NAG residues are bound to the C-terminal domain. In each sugar-binding site, three aromatic amino acid residues and one serine residue participate to the NAG3 binding. The sugar rings bound to two subsites are stacked to the side-chain groups of tryptophan or histidine and a tyrosine residue is in face-to-face contact with an acetylamino group, to which the hydroxyl group of a serine residue is hydrogen-bonded. The third subsite of the N-terminal domain binds a NAG moiety with hydrogen bonds. The results suggest that the triad of aromatic amino acid residues is intrinsic in sugar binding of hevein-like domains.

Introduction
Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) is a small plant lectin from stinging nettle and speci®c to N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) oligomers and chitin (Peumans et al., 1984; Shibuya et al., 1986). It agglutinates erythrocytes nonspeci®cally, induces the production of g-interferon in human lymphocytes (Van Damme et al., 1988), and acts as a superantigen in T cell activation (Galelli & Truffa-Bachi, 1993). This lectin has been suggested to have a role in plant defence and has shown to possess both

antifungal and insecticidal activities (Broekaert et al., 1989; Heusing et al., 1991). The amino acid sequence has suggested that the protein consists of two hevein-like domains with same spacing of cysteine residues and several other conserved residues (Beintema & Peumans, 1992; Lerner & Raikhel, 1992). The sugar binding experiments have suggested that UDA has two sugar binding sites which have intrinsically different af®nities. The UDA binds tri-N-acetylchitotriose (NAG3) 30fold stronger than di-N-acetylchitobiose (NAG2) while only threefold increase was observed in the binding of tetra-N-acetylchitotetraose (NAG4) compared to NAG3. Therefore, the binding site has been suggested to be complementary to NAG3 (Shibuya et al., 1986). On the other hand, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) is a lectin consisting of four hevein-like domains and its X-ray structure has shown that the sugar binding sites are located in the dimer interface (Wright, 1984).

674 has been reported for the formation of dimer structure of UDA. Crystal structures of hevein (Rodriguez-Romero et al., 1991) and three isolectins of WGA (Wright, 1987, 1989; Harata et al., 1995) have been reported, but until now we have no structural information about UDA and its sugar binding. UDA is a complex mixture of several isolectins with identical agglutination properties and sugar binding speci®city (Van Damme et al., 1988). Recently, a family of at least 16 uda genes encoding seven mature isolectins was identi®ed and six isolectins were isolated (Does et al., 1999). These six isolectins differ in some amino acid residues and their mixture has been used for the ®rst crystallization of UDA (Loris et al., 1993). In contrast, we have isolated an isolectin (Muraki et al., 1998) and succeeded in the crystallization with and without NAG3. The X-ray analysis revealed that it was the isolectin VI (UDA-VI) consisting of 89 amino acid residues (Table 1). Here, we report the threedimensional structure of UDA-VI and its NAG3 complex.

Results
Structure of UDA-VI UDA-VI consists of two domains, the N-terminal domain (domain-1) from 1 to 42 residues and the C-terminal domain (domain-2) from 47 to 89 residues (Table 1). These two domains are linked by the Glu43-Arg44-Ser45-Asp46 sequence. The primary structure of UDA is characteristic with rich content of glycine and cysteine residues. As shown in Figure 1, both domains have four disul®de bonds and this is a main reason for their rigid and stable backbone structures in spite of having few sheet or helical structures. Two short b-strands, Cys17-Ser19 and Cys35-Asn37, form an antiparallel sheet structure in domain-1 and the corresponding b-strands in domain-2 are Cys63-Ser65 and Cys82Tyr84. The backbone structure is also maintained by many hydrogen bonds between main-chain peptide groups; 21 and 19 N-H ÐO hydrogen bonds in domain-1 and domain-2, respectively. Several of these hydrogen bonds are involved in b- turns classi®ed into three types I, II, and III (Table 2). The superposition of the two domains is shown in Figure 2. Although the sequence similarity between the two domains is not high and 24 of 42 amino acid residues are different (Table 1), the backbone structures are very similar between the two domains, especially, four disul®de bonds are

nicely superimposed. However, a considerable deviation is observed in two loop regions. One is in the region of 3-9 in domain-1. The corresponding loop region 49-55 in domain-2 is laterally shifted. Another large difference is found between the regions 12-17 in domain-1 and 58-63 in domain-2. Both ends of these regions are ®xed by cysteine residues forming disul®de bonds. Domain-1 lacks a residue corresponding to Gly80 in domain-2. In the loop region including Gly80, the residues Ser78-Asn81 are in a type II b-turn while the Glu28-Cys31 residues in the corresponding region in domain-1 form a type I b-turn. The three aromatic amino acid residues, Trp21, Trp23, and Tyr30 in domain-1, which are involved in the

Figure 3 shows the superposition of two independent molecules in the NAG3 complex and the superposition of UDA-VI-1 of the NAG3 complex on the UDA-VI molecule in the native crystal. Except three residues from the C-terminal, the backbone structure of three UDA-VI molecules is almost identical. The r.m.s.d. for equivalent Ca positions between the two molecules in the NAG3 Ê complex is 0.71 A. The corresponding differences of these molecules from the native UDA-VI strucÊ Ê ture are 1.28 A for UDA-VI-1 and 1.32 A for UDAVI-2. The superposition of the side chain groups involved in the sugar binding indicates that the conformation of these groups are slightly affected by the interaction with NAG3. No signi®cant difference is observed in temperature factors between domain-1 and domain-2. The Ê average B-value of native UDA-VI is 20.3 A2 for all protein atoms. The temperature factor pro®les of two UDA-VI molecules in the NAG3 complex are similar to that of native UDA-VI. The average BÊ values of two independent molecules are 20.1 A2 Ê and 22.2 A2. This indicates that the sugar binding does not signi®cantly affect the thermal motion of UDA-VI. One reason is that the backbone structure is maintained by the eight disul®de bonds and many hydrogen bonds between main-chain peptide groups, and therefore the UDA-VI molecule seems to behave like a rigid-body.

Several hydrogen bonds link two domains and water molecules ®ll vacant spaces in the interface of these domains. The guanidino group of Arg85 is located at the center of the domain interface and form hydrogen bonds with main chain oxygen atoms of Leu15 and Lys38 in domain-1.

Structure of NAG3 As shown in Figure 4, two NAG3 molecules are well de®ned on the electron-density map. The average temperature factor of the molecules, Ê Ê 22.5 A2 of NAG3-1 and 20.0 A2 of NAG3-2 comparable to the average temperature factor of UDAVI molecules, indicates that NAG3 molecules are tightly sandwiched by UDA-VI molecules. The average temperature factors of residues A and B in Ê Ê NAG3-2, 13.9 A2 and 16.1 A2, respectively, are conÊ siderably smaller than 29.5 A2 of the residue C. A similar tendency also observed in NAG3-1 indicates that the residue C is more movable than residues A and B. The average temperature factor of Ê Ê each NAG residue in NAG3-1 is 18.2 A2, 20.0 A2, Ê and 28.8 A2 for residues A, B, and C, respectively. All pyranose rings in the NAG3 molecules take a 4 C1 chair conformation. Except the C1-C2-N2-C7 angle of the residue C, no signi®cant conformational difference is observed between the two NAG3 molecules. The primary hydroxyl groups in residues A and B are in ()-gauche conformation to the C5-O5 bond while the C6-O6 bond in the residue C is in (À)-gauche conformation. The two glycosidic linkages in each NAG3 molecule are very similar in their conformation. The O3-H ÐO5H hydrogen bonds formed between adjacent NAG residues impose restriction on the conformational ¯exibility of the glycosidic linkages and support the extended linear structure of NAG3. Structure of sugar binding The crystal of the NAG3 complex has two independent UDA-VI molecules. Each molecule has two sugar binding sites, but the crystal contains one NAG3 molecule per protein molecule. The protein molecules are so arranged in a head-to-tail mode that the sugar binding site of domain-1 faces to the sugar binding site of domain-2 of an adjacent molecule. As the result, a NAG3 molecule is sandwiched between two UDA-VI molecules as shown in Figure 5. The sugar binding site of domain-1 contacts to one side of the NAG3 molecule and the other side of NAG3 is bound to domain-2 of the adjacent molecule. Figure 6 shows the interaction of two NAG3 molecules with UDA-VI. The NAG3 molecules are

bound with hydrogen bonds and face-to-face contacts of pyranose rings with aromatic side chains. Hydrogen-bonding contacts of NAG3 molecules are given in Table 3. The NAG3-1 molecule sandwiched between domain-2 of UDA-VI-1 and domain-1 of UDA-VI-2 is in face-to-face contact with four aromatic side-chain groups. The sugar residue A is stacked to the side-chain of Trp69 of UDA-VI-1 while the sugar residue C is faced to the side-chain of Trp21 of UDA-VI-2. The sugar residue B is sandwiched by Trp23 of UDA-VI-2 and His 67 of UDA-VI-1. The Tyr76 in UDA-VI-1 and Tyr30 in UDA-VI-2 are in the face-to-face contact with the acetylamino group of sugar residues A and B, respectively. The phenolic hydroxyl groups of these tyrosines form hydrogen bonds with O3 hydroxyl groups of sugar residues A and B. The

O6 hydroxyl group of the sugar residue A forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl group of Cys24 of UDA-VI-2 while the acetyl oxygen atom is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Ser65 of UDA-VI-1. The O2 hydroxyl group and the acetyl oxygen atom of sugar residue B form hydrogen bonds with the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr30 and the hydroxyl group of Ser19, respectively. The NAG3-2 molecule is located between domain-1 of UDA-VI-1 and domain-2 of UDA-VI-2 with the binding structure very similar to NAG3-1. Especially, the same stacking interaction with aromatic side-chain groups is observed. In addition to the ®ve hydrogen bonds which are also found in the contact of NAG3-1, the amido group of the N-terminal residue of UDA-VI-1 forms a hydrogen

bond with the O6 hydroxyl group of the sugar residue A. Sugar residues A and B contact with two UDA-VI molecules, but the sugar residue C is only in van der Waals contact with Trp21 of UDA-VI-1. Therefore, the sugar residue C is much more ¯exible than the A and B residues as indicated by relatively large temperature factor. The acetylamino group of the residue C has no direct contact with UDA-VI and exhibits high conformational ¯exibility indicated by the comparison of C1-C2-N2-C7 torsion angles, 112.9  and 159.5  . The present crystal structure shows the heterogeneity in the sugar binding of the two binding sites. The sugar-binding site of domain-1 contacts with three NAG residues. The NAG residue A forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Cys24 in both UDA-VI molecules and the amido group of Gln1 in UDA-VI-1 also participates to the NAG3 binding with a hydrogen bond. In contrast, domain-2 only binds the NAG residues A and B in the same manner as the binding of the NAG residues B and C to domain-1 but has no contact with the NAG residue C.

Discussion
UDA is the smallest plant protein that exhibits agglutination function for cells and sugarappended proteins. It consists of two domains which are similar to hevein. The two domains are so arranged that the sugar-binding sites are located at both ends of the dumbbell-shape molecule. The structure of the NAG3 complex revealed that the sugar-binding site in domain-1 consists of three subsites complementary to the NAG3 structure. The sugar residues B and C are bound on the indole moieties of Trp23 and Trp21 with face-toface contact. The third subsite in domain-1 binds a NAG residue A by hydrogen bonds. Though only two NAG residues are bound to domain-2 in the present crystal structure, a model building study suggested the possibility of the third subsite where the hydrogen-bonding residues corresponding to Gln1 and Cys24 will be His47 and Cys70, respectively. NAG3 inhibits the agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes or sugar-appended bovine serum albumin by 30-fold stronger than NAG2 while NAG4 exhi-

bits only threefold increase of the inhibition compared to NAG3. The A and B sugar residues of NAG3 have the face-to-face contacts with aromatic amino acid residues of domain-2 in both UDA-VI molecules while the B and C sugar residues have the same contacts with domain-1. Such a binding of two UDA-VI molecules to one NAG3 is possible because the sugar residues B and C are related to the residues A and B by a pseudo twofold screw symmetry. Each NAG moiety is related to the next by 180  rotation followed by the translation of one moiety along the long axis of NAG3. The proteins are thus seen to bind one side of the NAG3 and then the other but advanced by one NAG unit. The formation of a similar dimeric structure associated with NAG3 is plausible in solution and will contribute to the drastic increase of the inhibition power of NAG3 compared to NAG2 because one NAG3 molecule inactivates each one binding site of two UDA molecules. NAG2 may also bind two UDA molecules, but the binding seems to be weak because one UDA molecule can contact with only one NAG residue. On the other hand, the stronger inhibition power of NAG4 is considered to be ascribed to that one NAG4 molecule can simultaneously occupy each three subsites of two UDA molecules. The sugar binding study in solution has suggested the difference in the sugar binding af®nity of the two binding sites of UDA. The superposition of the structures of two domains shows that the geometry of both sugar-binding sites is basically same as shown in Figure 3. The difference in the binding af®nity is ascribed to the difference in amino acid residues involving the sugar binding. The Trp21 residue in domain-1 is replaced by His in the corresponding 67th residue in domain-2. The Gln1 residue corresponding to His47 in domain-2 is converted to pyroglutamic acid which has a 2pyrrolidone moiety. The 2-pyrrolidone moiety is similar in its shape to the imidazolyl group of His47 but may differ in hydrogen bonding contact with a ligand sugar. In addition, the sugar binding site in domain-2 containing two His residues expects higher pH dependency of sugar binding than the binding site of domain-1, where no ionizable residues are involved in the sugar-binding. Several crystal structures of protein-sugar complexes with oligosaccharides have been reported,

Crystal Structure of UDA-sugar Complex

679 amino acid residues in the sugar-binding sites are mostly tyrosine and phenylalanine. The complex with di-N-acetylchitobiose (NAG2) revealed the two distinct binding sites of WGA (Wright, 1984). At the primary site, a NAG2 molecule is bound in a similar manner to that observed in the binding of NAG3 to UDA-VI although the tyrosine residues, instead of tryptophan in UDA-VI, are faced to pyranose rings of NAG2. At the secondary binding site of WGA, NAG2 is bound by hydrogen bonds because of the lack of aromatic amino acid residues except a tyrosine residue which is faced to the acetylamino group. On the other hand, the sugar binding site of hevein consists of two subsites which involve the same amino acid residues as Ser19, Trp21, Trp23, and Tyr30 in domain-1 of UDA-VI. The NMR study has proposed a binding structure of NAG2 (Asensio et al., 1995), which is similar to the binding of the NAG residues A and B to domain-2. In the UDA-VI complex with NAG3, the binding mode is basically same in both independent molecules. The NAG2 moiety is the basic unit that is recognized and bound by the triads of aromatic amino acid residues, Trp21, Trp23, and Tyr30 in domain-1, and His67, Trp69, and Tyr76 in domain2. Therefore, a set of these three aromatic amino acid residues are of primary importance in the sugar binding. The Trp21 and Trp23 in domain-1 ®x the position and orientation of two pyranose rings. The Tyr30 not only ®xes the acetyl group of sugar residue B by the face-to-face contact but also recognizes the O3 hydroxyl group. In addition, Ser19 in domain-1 and Ser65 in domain-2 commonly participate to from a hydrogen bond with the acetyl oxygen atom in sugar residues B and A, respectively. The N-acetylamino group is unique in the NAG structure compared with other sugars bound to various lectins (Rini, 1995) and the recognition of this group is essential for chitin binding. The present structure suggests that the face-to-face contact with tyrosine and hydrogen bonding with serine are responsible for the recognition of the acetyl group.

such as, WGA complex with a sialylglycopeptide (Wright & Jaeger, 1993), pea lectin complex with trimannoside (Rini et al., 1993), FGF complex with a trisaccharide (Ormitz et al., 1995), hemagglutinin complex with sialyllactose (Weis et al.,1988), etc. WGA, a lectin speci®c to N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylglucosamine, consists of four heveinlike chitin binding domains. The sequence homology of domains between WGA and UDA is less than 50 %, but the alignment of eight cysteine residues are conserved. Each domain of WGA isolectin 3 (Harata et al., 1995) was superimposed on each domain of UDA-VI. The r.m.s.d. between corresponding Ca atoms in the superimposed structures Ê was in the range from 1.0 to 1.4 A. Although the backbone structure of these domains is almost same between WGA and UDA, the arrangement of two domains consisting of UDA-VI is different from that observed in WGA because UDA-VI has the hinge region of 43-46 residues. When domain-1 of UDA-VI is superimposed on one domain of WGA, domain-2 of UDA-VI is shifted far from the next domain of WGA as shown in Figure 7. UDA has two sugar-binding sites on the molecular surface, but WGA is active in the form of dimer. The sugar binding sites of WGA are located in the dimer interface and ligand sugars are inserted into the cleft created between two WGA molecules. Being different from UDA, the aromatic

Crystallization The isolectin (UDA-VI) was puri®ed according to the method described in the previous paper (Muraki et al., 1998). Lyophilized UDA-VI was dissolved in water to prepare a 2 % solution and used for crystallization. Crystals of native UDA-VI and its complex with NAG3 were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Trials of crystallization using Crystal ScreenTM (Hampton Research) showed that the protein crystallizes in the presence of several PEGs and alcohols but the pH condition was limited to the range 5-6. Crystals suitable for X-ray measurement were obtained at pH 5.6 with the reservoir solution containing 15 % (w/v) PEG1000 and 0.1 M citrate buffer. To 5 ml of protein solution, an equi-amount of the reservoir solution was added and the sample solution was equilibrated over 1 ml reservoir solution. Crystals of

native UDA-VI were grown in the shape of a rectangular prism in a week. Crystals of the NAG3 complex, which were aggregated thin plates, were obtained by the same procedure except for that the sample solution contained 2 mM NAG3. The concentration of NAG3 was critical and the solution with 5 mM NAG3 did not yield the crystal. The protein-sugar ratio of the crystalline NAG3 complex is 1:1 and the higher concentration of NAG3 may prevent the crystallization because of changing the stoichiometry of the complex. Data collection The preliminary X-ray experiments were carried out on a Rigaku RAXIS-IIc diffractometer with a Rota¯ex FR generator (45 kV, 50 mA, focal spot size 0.1 mm). The native crystal with the orthorhombic space group P212121 has the unit cell dimensions of a  31.92, Ê Ê b  41.29, and c  76.45 A. The Vm value of 2.70 A3 DaÀ1 indicated that the asymmetric unit contained one molecule. The space group of the NAG3 complex was P21 and the asymmetric unit contained two independent Ê UDA-VI molecules (Vm  2.15 A3 DaÀ1). The cell dimenÊ sions were a  25.55, b  56.79, c  55.30 A, and b  92.68  . Intensity data were collected at 286 K on a Nonius FAST diffractometer equipped with a FR571 generator (40kV, 50mA, focal spot size 0.2 mm). Three crystals were used for the data collection of native UDA-VI to Ê the resolution of 1.4 A and three sets of re¯ection data were merged to a set of 19125 independent re¯ections with the Rmerge of 0.031 for all data (89 % completeness) and 0.054 for the last shell (76 % completeness). The average I/s(I) ratio was 7.98 for all data and 1.21 for the last shall. Intensity data of the NAG3 complex were colÊ lected to 1.8 A resolution and 42191 re¯ections from one

Crystal Structure of UDA-sugar Complex crystal were reduced to a set of 13723 independent re¯ections with the Rmerge value of 0.088 for all data (93 % completeness) and 0.362 for the last shell (33 % completeness). The average I/s(I) ratio was 14.7 for all data and 1.07 for the last shall. Statistics of data collection are given in Table 4. Structure determination The structure of native UDA-VI was determined by the MIR method using three heavy atom derivatives, K2PtCl4, HgCl2, and NaAuCl4. The MIR phases were calÊ culated for the re¯ections with the resolution to 2.5 A. The ®gure of merit was 0.86. The electron density map was improved by solvent ¯attening (Wang, 1985) to the R-value of 0.22 for the map inversion and the resulted map was used for the model building. The backbone structure with eight disul®de bonds was unambiguously traced on the electron density map. The structure was re®ned by the energy minimization combined with molÈ ecular dynamics simulation (Brunger et al., 1987). The ®nal structure model contained one UDA-VI and 54 water molecules. The R and Rfree values were 0.229 and 0.267, respectively, for the re¯ections within the resolÊ ution range 8.0-1.5 A. The electron density map indicated highly anisotropic motion of sulfur atoms and considerable residual electron density was observed around the sulfur atoms. This may be a reason for relatively high R-value. The structure of the NAG3 complex was solved by molecular replacement using a set of coordinates of native UDA-VI. The self-rotation function indicated that the two independent molecules were related with the rotation angles (90,0,180). The orientation and position of one molecule were determined by the cross-rotation search and translation search, respectively. The local

Crystal Structure of UDA-sugar Complex symmetry was operated for the molecule to obtain the orientation of the second molecule and the successive translation search determined its position in the unit cell. The structure was re®ned by the same procedure used in the re®nement of native UDA-VI. Two NAG3 molecules were found in a Fo À Fc map. The R and Rfree values were 0.183 and 0.253, respectively, for the re¯ections Ê within the resolution range 8.0-1.9 A. The ®nal structure model consists of two UDA-VI molecules, two NAG3 molecules, and 85 water molecules. The structures were examined with the program PROCHECK. Protein Data Bank accession codes Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank (ID code 1EHD for the native structure and 1EHH for the NAG3 complex).
