Circular and Circularly Permuted Forms of Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor
Two novel forms of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor have been prepared. The amino- and carboxyl-termini, which are in close proximity in the native conformation, were linked together in a peptide bond, thus generating a molecule with a circular backbone. The circular molecule was then cleaved between Lys15 and Alal6, to yield a linear molecule whose sequence is a circular permutation of that of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Both of these modified forms could refold to the native conformation after being reduced, and promise to be interesting subjects for further folding experiments.

Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor has been the subject of extensive experimental and theoretical studies of protein folding and conformation (Creighton, 1978; Levitt, 1980; McCammon et al., 1977; Wuthrich et al., 1982). By trapping and characterizing folding intermediates with different disulphide bonds, the pathway of refolding of reduced BPTI t has been determined (Creighton, 1978). These studies have shown that the refolding pathway is determined by a small number of intermediates containing specific disulphide bonds, some of which are present in the native conformation, but others of which are non-native interactions (Creighton, 1977). However, at present there is little detailed knowledge of the roles of specific amino acid residues, other than the cysteine and methionine (Creighton & Dyckes, 1981) residues, in stabilizing the folding intermediates. One approach to studying the role of the amino acid sequence in determining the folding pathway would be to alter the covalent structure in a manner which either increases or decreases the stability of the native protein, and then examine the effect of these modifications on the intermediates, kinetics, and energetics of the folding pathway. In the native conformation of BPTI, the amino- (N) and carboxyl- (C) termini are in close proximity (Deisenhofer & Steigman, 1975) (Fig. l(a)) and in solution form a salt bridge (Brown et al., 1978). A covalent crosslink between these residues should stabilize the native conformation and those intermediates in which the termini are brought together, but should destabilize intermediates with conformations in which the termini are separated. A circular protein might be further modified by specifically cleaving it to generate a new linear protein with a circularly permuted sequence. Such a permuted protein might have quite interesting folding properties, particularly if the cleavage separates residues engaged in local interactions in the folding intermediates. A circular permutation of a protein sequence appears to have t Abbreviation used: BPTI, bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. 407 0022-2836/83/100407-07 $03.00/0 © 1983 AcademicPress Inc.

In tile crystal, the termini do not form a salt bridge as they do in solution (Brown et al.. 1978), presumably because of the high pH and alternative intermolecular interactions in the crystal. In (b) and (c) residues 58 and I have been connected to represent the peptide bond formed between the termini by treatment with a water-soluble carbodiimide (l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide, EDC). However. the indicated connection is only schematic, and no attempt has been made to construct a stereochemically correct mode/, which would require rearrangements of tile terminal residues fl'om their positions in the crystal of tile unmodified protein. In (c) the bond between Lysl5 and Alal6 has been removed to represent the cleaved circular protein. Again, the positions of the residues have not been altered in tile diagram, though there may be some changes upon cleavage. The pictures were generously prepared by A.M. Lesk, using a computer program written by A.M. Lesk and K.D. Hardman (Lesk & Hardman, 1982).

arisen naturally in the evolution of the plant lectins concanavalin A and favin (Cunningham et al., 1979). Like BPTI, the N- and C-termini of concanavalin A are in sufficient proximity in the native conformation to make the structure compatible with permuted sequences (Reeke et al., 1975). Experiments on the folding of artificially permuted forms of BPTI might indicate the evolutionary constraints on such genetic rearrangements of protein sequences. In order to form a cross-link between the N- and C-termini, native BPTI was treated with a water-soluble carbodiimide (Bauminger & Wilchek, 1980; Carraway & Koshland, 1972). Such a cross-link would be expected to have no effect on the gel electrophoretic mobility of the native protein (except at extremes of pH), but should increase that of the unfolded form of the protein, by preventing extended conformations of the chain. Lanes (a) and (b) of Figure 2 show that extensive treatment of native BPTI with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide had such an effect. Normally, the electrophoretic mobility of BPTI is reduced by about one-third by reduction of its disulphide bonds and unfolding (lanes (a)), whereas 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide treatment generated a more rapidly migrating reduced form (lanes (b)). This assay for presumed cross-linking was used to optimize the conditions for the cross-linking reaction, minimizing other modifications that were evident from

After gel filtration into 0'01 M-HC1, the solution was made 0-01 M in disodium tetraborate (pH 9), and applied to a 1'5 cm x90 cm column of carboxymethyl cellulose (Whatman CM52) equilibrated with 0'01 Mdisodium tetraborate (pH 9), 0"001 m-EDTA. The column was eluted with a 2-1 linear gradient of 0 to 0"6 M-NaCI ; the absorbance at 280 nm was monitored continuously. The peak eluting first was found to contain almost entirely (>90~o) molecules which were eleetrophoretically indistinguishable from untreated BPTI, while the second peak contained the cross-linked molecules shown in lanes (c) of Fig. 2. (b) Separation of circular and cleaved forms of BPTI. The mixture of cross-linked and unmodified protein generated by treatment with EDC was incubated with 0"1 M-Na(BH4) to selectively reduce the 14---38 disulphide bond (Kress & Laskowski, 1967). The protein was then incubated with 0'1 M equivalents of porcine trypsin (Koch-Light) for 40 h at 25°C, when approximately 60~o of the molecules had been cleaved (Jering & Tsehesche, 1976). The BPTI was separated from the trypsin by gel filtration a t pH 1-7 (Sephadex GS0, fine), and the 14---38 disulphide bond was reformed by airoxidation a t room temperature for 6 days in 0"01 M-disodium tetraborate (pH 9). The 4 forms of BPTI were resolved by chromatography as described for (a). Trypsin treatment of BPTI and of circular BPTI separately gave rise to peaks I and II, respectively.

with the termini cross-linked would have neither ionized and, consequently, a greater positive charge. Lanes (c) of Figure 2 show the purified cross-linked protein to be nearly homogeneous. The cross-link was determined by peptide mapping and sequencing to be a peptide bond between the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. Tryptic peptides of performic acid-oxidized proteins were resolved by two-dimensional paper electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Only the normal N- and C-terminal peptides were altered in the map of the modified protein, being replaced primarily by a new peptide with the amino acid composition and electrophoretic mobilities expected for the sum of the N- and C-terminal peptides. The new peptide was partially sequenced by a modified Edman procedure (Chang et al., 1978), and the sequence was found to be composed of residues 54 to 58, followed by the residues beginning with Argl :

Therefore, a peptide bond must link the previously C-terminal (AlaS8) and Nterminal (~hrgl) residues, generating a circular molecule (Fig. l(b)).

FIG. 4. (a) Peptide mapping of untreated and (b) cross-linked BPTI. Protein samples (2 mg) were oxidized in performic acid and then digested with 0"02 mg bovine trypsin for 8 h. The digested peptides were electrophoresed on paper at pH 6"5 (anode at left), and in the second dimension at pH 2-1 (anode at bottom). Staining was with 0-42% (w/v) ninhydrin and 0"1% (w/v) cadmium acetate in 85% (v/v) acetone, 5°/o (v/v) acetic acid. The peptides were identified by quantitative amino acid analysis and their electrophoretic mobilities (Offord, 1977). The N- and C-terminal peptides of unmodified BPTI am labelled N and C in (a) and were composed of Argl through Lysl5 and Thr54 through AlaS8, respectively. These peptides were linked together in the modified protein to generate the peptide labelled C-N in (b). The peptide labelled X in (b) was composed of the linked N- and C-terminal peptides plus the peptide Ale40 through Arg42. The other tryptic peptides of BPTI, which are positively charged at pH 6"5, were electrophoresed from these maps, but other maps, electrophoresed for shorter times, showed that none of the positive peptides was altered in the modified protein.

There was also a second minor peptide unique to the modified protein. Amino acid analysis and electrophoretic mobilities indicated that this peptide arose from a fraction of the modified molecules which contained a second cross-link, probably between Glu7 and Lys41, which are close together in the folded protein (Deisenhofer & Steigman, 1975). Quantitative amino acid analysis indicated that this peptide was present at only about 10% of the level of the other peptides, although it stained very intensely with ninhydrin. By cleaving the circular molecule, it should be possible to prepare circularly permuted forms of BPTI. BPTI can be specifically cleaved between Lysl5 and Alal6 with trypsin if the disulphide bond between residues 14 and 38 is reduced (Kress & Laskowski, 1968; Jering & Tschesche, 1976). Since the cross-linked terminal residues are not near the trypsin binding site, it should be possible to cleave the circular molecule also in this Way, to generate a linear molecule with Alal6 as the new N-terminal residue. BPTI was treated with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl) carbodiimide as described above to generate a mixture of unmodified and circular molecules, which was then cleaved with trypsin. Ion-exchange chromatography separated the four major products of this treatment (Fig. 3(b)): cleaved (but uncross-linked) (I), cleaved circular (II), unmodified (III), and circular (IV) forms of BPTI. All of the peaks had amino acid compositions identical to that of untreated BPTI. Lanes (d) in Figure 2 contain the cleaved circular protein from peak II. As expected, if the treatment generated a linear molecule, the reduced sample had a mobility nearly identical to that of reduced, unmodified BPTI. In order to confirm its identity, the protein in peak II was subjected to several cycles of automated Edman degradation (after reduction and alkylation). The sequence obtained corresponded to that of BPTI beginning with Alal6:

Ala-Arg-Ile-Ile-Arg-Tyr-Phe-Tyr-Asn-Ala. . . . thus confirming that a circular permutation of the BPTI sequence had been generated (Fig. 1 (c)). Both the circular and circularly permuted forms of BPTI were active as trypsin inhibitors, binding stoichiometrically to trypsin at a concentration of 2 x 10 -6 M. However, the rate at which inhibition was attained was found to be 1000 times slower with both species in which the "active site" peptide bond was cleaved (I and II of Fig. 3(b)) than with unmodified BPTI. Preliminary experiments have shown that both the circular and permuted forms of BPTI are able to refold to the active conformation after being unfolded by reduction of the three disulphide bonds. However, they do so with significant differences in both kinetics and accumulation of disulphide-containing folding intermediates. Experiments are in progress to characterize the folding pathways for these novel proteins. These experiments should help to determine the importance during folding of the covalent connectivity of the polypeptide chain and the roles of the N- and C-terminal regions. Studies of additional permuted forms, generated by cleavage of the circular protein at other sites, may be a means of examining the roles of other regions of the protein during folding.
