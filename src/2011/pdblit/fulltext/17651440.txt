The crystal structure of the highly thermostable l-aspartate dehydrogenase (l-aspDH; EC 1.4.1.21) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus was determined in the presence of NAD and a substrate analog, citrate. The dimeric structure of A. fulgidus l-aspDH was refined at ° a resolution of 1.9 A with a crystallographic R-factor of 21.7% (Rfree ¼ 22.6%). The structure indicates that each subunit consists of two domains separated by a deep cleft containing an active site. Structural comparison of the A. fulgidus l-aspDH / NAD / citrate ternary complex and the Thermotoga maritima l-aspDH / NAD binary complex showed that A. fulgidus l-aspDH assumes a closed conformation and that a large movement of the two loops takes place during substrate binding. Like T. maritima l-aspDH, the A. fulgidus enzyme is highly thermostable. But whereas a large number of inter- and intrasubunit ion pairs are responsible for the stability of A. fulgidus l-aspDH, a large number of inter- and intrasubunit aromatic pairs stabilize the T. maritima enzyme. Thus stabilization of these two l-aspDHs appears to be achieved in different ways. This is the first detailed description of substrate and coenzyme binding to l-aspDH and of the molecular basis of the high thermostability of a hyperthermophilic l-aspDH.

In prokaryotes, de novo NAD biosynthesis generally proceeds via a condensation reaction between l-aspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate that is catalyzed by two enzymes: l-aspartate oxidase (LAO; the nadB gene product) and quinolinate synthase (QS; the nadA gene product) [1]. LAO catalyzes the oxidation of l-aspartate to iminoaspartate, after which QS catalyzes the condensation of iminoaspartate with dihydroxyacetone phosphate to produce quinolinate. Quinolinate is then converted to nicotinate mononucleotide by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (the nadC gene product), which is followed by conversion to NAD via a metabolic sequence involving two enzymes: nicotinate

mononucleotide adenylyltransferase and NAD synthase [2]. We recently detected the presence of LAO in Pyrococcus horikoshii OT-3, an anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon that grows optimally at 98 °C [3]. In addition to the oxidase reaction, this LAO also catalyzed FAD-dependent l-aspartate dehydrogenation using fumarate as an electron acceptor. This was the first example of an LAO produced in either the archaeal domain or an obligate anaerobic organism. Thereafter, we identified genes encoding homologs of four other enzymes involved in de novo NAD biosynthesis in the P. horikoshii genome and found that nadB forms

an operon with nadA, nadC and three other unknown genes. We therefore proposed that a de novo NAD biosynthetic pathway functions in P. horikoshii under anaerobic conditions [3]. More recently, a previously unknown amino acid dehydrogenase, l-aspartate dehydrogenase (l-aspDH; the TM1643 gene product), was identified in a hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima by Yang et al. based on the 3D structure of the gene product [4]. This enzyme catalyzes NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenation of l-aspartate to produce iminoaspartate. Because the gene encoding l-aspDH also forms an operon with nadA and nadC within the T. maritima genome, those authors suggested that l-aspDH catalyzes the first step in the de novo biosynthesis of NAD in this organism. Thus, two different types of oxidoreductase may have evolved to catalyze the first step of de novo NAD biosynthesis in prokaryotes [4]. Bearing in mind that hyperthermophilic archaea are phylogenetically ancient, our interest in the phylogenetic relationship between LAO and l-aspDH led us to screen for an l-aspDH homolog in the genomes of hyperthermophilic archaea. Within the genomic sequence of an anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, we found a gene (AF1838) whose predicted amino acid sequence exhibits 38% identity with that of T. maritima l-aspDH. In addition, we showed that the gene product expressed in Escherichia coli acts as a highly thermostable l-aspDH [5]. Yang et al. determined the structure of T. maritima l-aspDH in the presence of NAD and analyzed the structural features responsible for its dehydrogenase activity [4]. T. maritima l-aspDH does not share structural similarity with the superfamilies that include the l-leucine, l-valine, l-glutamate and l-phenylalanine dehydrogenase, and l-alanine dehydrogenase, despite all these enzymes catalyzing similar chemical reactions. In addition, the structure of T. maritima l-aspDH has only low similarity to aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, inositol 1-phosphate synthase and dihydrodipicolinate dehydrogenase. This enzyme thus appears to represent a new class of amino acid dehydrogenase. However, details about the molecular strategy underlying its high thermal stability, as well as the manner in which substrate and coenzyme are bound by the enzyme, are still unclear. Therefore, our aim was to determine the structure of the A. fulgidus l-aspDH in complex with NAD and a substrate analog, citrate. Factors that could stabilize the enzyme were then compared with those in the T. maritima l-aspDH, and the structural features that appear to be responsible for the high thermostability of each enzyme are discussed. Finally, we describe a substrate-induced conforma4316

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The structure of A. fulgidus l-aspDH was determined using multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (MIRAS) and was refined at a resolu° tion of 1.9 A (Table 1). The asymmetric unit consisted of one homodimer with a solvent content of 39.3%, which corresponds to a Matthew's coefficient [6] of ° 2.0 A3ÆDa)1. The model contained 236 ordered amino acid residues in each subunit and 136 water molecules. ° The two almost identical (r.m.s.d. ¼ 0.42 A) subunits ° had approximate dimensions of 35 · 53 · 44 A and were related by a twofold noncrystallographic rotation axis and associated closely through antiparallel b sheets (b11 and b11¢) (Fig. 1A). Each monomer consisted of two domains: an N-terminal coenzyme-binding domain (a1­a5, a10, b1­b6, b12­b14), which formed a classical Rossmann-fold motif, and a C-terminal domain (a6­ a9, b7­b11), in which both the catalytic activity and formation of the homodimer were mediated (Fig. 1B). Overall domain organization was similar to that of T. maritima l-aspDH, but with several critical differences in the structural details. Structural comparison of A. fulgidus and T. maritima L-aspDHs When we compared the structures of the A. fulgidus l-aspDH / NAD / citrate ternary complex and the T. maritima l-aspDH / NAD binary complex, we found that the overall folds of A. fulgidus and T. maritima l-aspDH were similar (Fig. 3A), which was expected, given their relatively high sequence identity (38%) (Fig. 2). The internal structure of the A. fulgidus enzyme was basically the same as that of the T. mari° tima enzyme (r.m.s.d. ¼ 1.9 A for the Ca atoms of 223 residues), although a marked difference was observed in the position of three loops in the catalytic domain. When the Rossmann-fold domain of the A. fulgidus l-aspDH structure was superimposed on that of the T. maritima l-aspDH structure, we observed a large shift in the positions of two loops (loop 1: R133­ G143, loop 2: V180­I188 in the A. fulgidus l-aspDH) toward the active site cavity (Fig. 3). The average movements of loops 1 and 2 were estimated to be 3.2 ° and 3.6 A, and the largest movements of loops 1 and 2 ° ° were estimated to be 6.7 A (K142) and 5.8 A (E183), respectively. As described below, this large

conformational change may be essential for substrate binding. In addition, loop 3 (P208­S216), which is disordered in the T. maritima enzyme, was clearly observable in the structure of A. fulgidus enzyme and formed a flap over the active site cavity (Fig. 3). It has been proposed that the structure of T. maritima l-aspDH assumes an open configuration [4]. Our results strongly suggest that loop 3 functions as the substratebinding site and the structure of A. fulgidus l-aspDH assumes a closed configuration. Substrate binding In the electron-density map of A. fulgidus l-aspDH obtained from our preliminary experimental data, we noticed an extra density within the active site cavity and found that a citrate molecule could be modeled into that density after construction and refinement of the peptide chain. The map clearly defined the precise orientation of the citrate (Fig. 4A): the two oxygen atoms in the C-1 carboxyl group of the citrate form

hydrogen bonds with the side chain of K134, a proton at the main chain amide of L161, and a water molecule (WAT33); two oxygen atoms in the C-5 carboxyl group are located within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chain of N162 and backbone amide protons in N162 and V163; oxygen atoms in the C-6 carboxyl group form hydrogen and ionic bonds with the side chains of N187, H189 and S216, and the main chain amide proton in S216; and an oxygen atom in the C-3 hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of K134. Together, these bonds tightly hold the citrate near the nicotinamide ring of NAD. Based on the structure of citrate, we modeled the l-aspartate molecule into the active site of A. fulgidus l-aspDH (Fig. 4B) and then minimized the energy of the complex using insight ii (Biosym / MSI, San Diego, CA). Within this structure, two oxygen atoms of the Ca carboxylate are situated within hydrogen- and ionic-bonding distance of the side chains of N187, H189 and S216, and the main chain amide proton of S216. In addition, the oxygen atoms of the Cb carboxyl group

are within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chain of K134, the main chain amide proton of L161, and a water molecule (WAT33). All of the residues are conserved in T. maritima l-aspDH, except for L161, which is replaced with Ile. Within the active site of the T. maritima enzyme, however, we found that the side chains of residues corresponding to K134 in loop 1, N187 in loop 2 and S216 in loop 3 are far removed from the l-aspartate molecule, and it does not appear that hydrogen bonds are formed with the carboxyl groups of the substrate (Figs 3A and 4B). This

suggests that the large movement of loops 1 and 2, in addition to the formation of a flap by loop 3, may induce the suitable positioning of the three residues (K134, N187 and S216) for substrate binding and the expression of l-aspDH's catalytic activity. In general, NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases show pro-R or pro-S stereospecificity for hydrogen removal from the C4 position of the nicotinamide moiety of NAD(P)H. In our binding model, the re-face of the nicotinamide ring is in front of the a-hydrogen atom of substrate (Fig. 4B), and that is in good agreement with our earlier finding that A. fulgidus l-aspDH belongs to the dehydrogenase group with pro-R-specific hydrogen transfer [5]. Cofactor binding The electron density corresponding to the NAD coenzyme bound within the active site was very clear, which enabled us to place the ligand with reasonable accuracy (Fig. S1). The map enabled clear positioning of the adenine ring, identification of the C2¢-endo

conformation of the two ribose rings, clear definition of the backbone phosphate groups and assignment of an anti conformation to the glycosidic bond linking the nicotinamide ring and its associated ribose moiety. N7, N1 and N6 of the adenine base, respectively, formed hydrogen bonds with the side chains of S59 and Y66 and, via a water molecule (WAT26), with the side chain of D65. The hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose interact with R33 using side-on geometry. A glycine-rich motif, GXGXXG, which lies close to the adenine ribose, dictates the nature of the hydrogen bonding between the main chain and the adenine ribose moiety [7]. In A. fulgidus l-aspDH, this motif is recognized at the position of the 7­12th amino acids from the N-terminus (Fig. 2). It is known that the occurrence of an aspartic or glutamic acid residue at the C- or N-terminus of the second b strand of the bab fold is a common feature of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases [8­12]. The acidic residue plays an important role in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the adenine ribose hydroxyl groups of the cofactor [13,14]. In A. fulgidus l-aspDH, D31, which is at the N-terminal end of b2, forms hydrogen bonds with the 2¢ and 3¢ hydroxyl groups of the adenine ribose of NAD (Fig. 5). The adenine phosphate interacts with A10, I11, a water molecule (WAT119) and, via water molecules, with R33 (WAT125) and A57 (WAT5). In addition, the nicotinamide phosphate interacts with N212, T215 and a water molecule (WAT119) and, via a water molecule (WAT5), with A57. The hydroxyl groups of the nicotinamide ribose interact with the side chain of S81, N162 and backbone oxygen of A58. The hydrogen-bonding pattern between the enzyme and NAD is completed by interactions between the carboxyamide moiety of the nicotinamide ring and the main-chain NH of A111, the main-chain oxygen of L80, the side chain of T166 (via water molecule WAT38), and the main-chain oxygen of A108. These hydrogen bonds lead to an anti conformer for the glycosidic bond between the nicotinamide ring and its associated ribose, and enable the 4-pro-R hydrogen atom to be involved in the hydride-transfer step.

It is thought that, in general, a reduction in the solvent-accessible surface area and an increase in the fraction of buried hydrophobic atoms are the stabilizing principles that serve as the basis for protein thermostability [15].

the A. fulgidus and T. maritima l-aspDH monomers were determined to be 149 and 131, respectively, and the number of intersubunit hydrogen bonds was 26 and 28, respectively. Again, the two enzymes showed considerable similarity. Comparison of the amino acid compositions The higher numbers of Pro at the N1 position or Ala and lower numbers of b-branched residues (Val, Thr and Ile) are known to correlate significantly with the thermostability of proteins by stabilizing their a helices [16­18]. The total numbers of Pro at the N1 position and b-branched residues were 0 and 15, respectively, in the a helices of A. fulgidus l-aspDH, and 1 and 18, respectively, in the T. maritima enzyme. By contrast, the total numbers of Ala residues in the a helices of A. fulgidus and T. maritima l-aspDHs were 15 and 5, respectively. Thus, A. fulgidus and T. maritima l-aspDHs do not differ significantly with respect to their Pro or b-branched residue contents; however, the relatively high Ala content in the a helices of the A. fulgidus l-aspDH might contribute to its thermostability. Ion-pair interaction Recent studies of the structures of hyperthermophilic proteins have shown that the number of ion pairs and the formation of ion networks contribute significantly

to the thermostability of these enzymes [19­21]. We examined the structural characteristics of the A. fulgidus [5] and T. maritima l-aspDHs from the aspect of high thermostability. The stability of T. maritima l-aspDH has not been reported to date. Thus, we expressed the enzyme gene in E. coli and purified the recombinant enzyme to homogeneity. Thermostability of the enzyme was then compared with that of A. fulgidus l-aspDH. The half-life of A. fulgidus l-aspDH (t1 / 2 ¼ 10.0 min) was similar to that of T. maritima enzyme (t1 / 2 ¼ 10.7 min) at 100 °C, indicating that the thermostabilities of the two enzymes are comparable. ° Using a cut-off distance of 4.0 A between oppositely charged residues, we calculated that A. fulgidus l-aspDH contained 16 intrasubunit ion pairs, whereas T. maritima l-aspDH contained only nine (Table 2). In addition, three major intersubunit ion-pair interactions were observed in A. fulgidus l-aspDH: E201­ R203¢, R203­E201¢ and R95­E232¢ (the prime indicates the neighboring subunit in the dimer). An ion pair between E232 and R95¢ could not be observed because of the poor electron density of the side chains. Four (E201, R203, E201¢, and R203¢) of the residues are located within b11 and b11¢, and form a four-residue ion-pair network between the A and B subunits (Fig. 6). In the T. maritima l-aspDH, the charged R95 is replaced by aromatic F93, which is involved in the largest aromatic pair network in T. maritima enzyme (see below). In addition, T. maritima l-aspDH contains no ion-pair networks (Table 2). Aromatic pair interaction Aromatic interactions are also known to participate in stabilizing protein structure [22,23].

interactions contributes between )0.6 and )1.3 kcalÆ mol)1 to protein stability [24]. Using a cut-off distance ° between the aromatic ring centers of 7.0 A, we determined that there are six intrasubunit aromatic pairs in A. fulgidus l-aspDH (Table 2). By contrast, there are 11 aromatic pairs in T. maritima l-aspDH. The most extensive aromatic pair network (seven residues; Y75, F83, F88, F92, F93, F105, and F240¢) is located in the Rossmann-fold domain (Fig. S2), and two of those residues (F105 and F240¢) form an intersubunit aromatic pair. By contrast, the largest aromatic pair network identified in A. fulgidus l-aspDH is composed of only four residues (F14, W18, F24, and Y217) and is located on the surface of the Rossmann-fold domain (Fig. S2). It is noteworthy that whereas five major intersubunit aromatic pair interactions (F105­F240¢, F122­Y225¢, F206­F206¢, Y225­F122¢, and F240­ F105¢) were observed in T. maritima l-aspDH, there are no intersubunit aromatic pairs in the A. fulgidus enzyme (Fig. S2). Structure-based sequence alignment showed that with the exception of F83 and F88, the residues forming the largest aromatic pair network in T. maritima l-aspDH were replaced by nonaromatic residues in A. fulgidus l-aspDH (Fig. 7). Thus, while it appears that intersubunit ion-pair interactions are the primary mediators of the high thermostability of A. fulgidus l-aspDH, the relatively large number of intersubunit aromatic pairs suggests they are the major mediators of T. maritima l-aspDH thermostability.

Experimental procedures
Protein expression and purification
Expression of the gene encoding A. fulgidus l-aspDH in E. coli and its purification from the recombinant cells was carried out as described previously [5].

Fig. 7. The largest aromatic pair network, formed by seven residues in T. maritima L-aspDH (A), and the equivalent positions in A. fulgidus L-aspDH (B). Residues belonging to the A and B subunits are shown in green and magenta, respectively. Atoms are colored as described for Fig. 3.

Crystallization
For the crystallization trails, purified A. fulgidus l-aspDH was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 m NaCl. Crystallization of l-aspDH was accomplished using the sitting-drop vapordiffusion method, and the initial screening was carried out using Crystal Screen Cryo (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA) at 20 °C. The crystal obtained belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21212, and the unit cell param° ° ° eters were a ¼ 47.52 A, b ¼ 89.58 A, c ¼ 100.49 A and a ¼ b ¼ c ¼ 90°. The crystals were grown in sitting drops in which 1 lL of enzyme solution (14.5 mgÆmL)1) containing 1 mm NAD was mixed with 1 lL of mother liquor containing 100 mm phosphate-citrate buffer pH 4.2 (60.5 mm

Na2HPO4, 39.5 mm citric acid), 5% (v / v) polyethylene glycol 3000 (PEG 3000), 10% (v / v) glycerol and 22% (v / v) 1.2-propanediol.

Data collection
Crystals were coated with a layer of viscous oil (Paratone-N) and transferred into a stream of nitrogen gas for data collection at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected at a reso° lution of 1.9 A on beamline KEK-NW12 at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) using monochromatized radia° tion at k ¼ 1.0 A and an ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems, San Diego, CA, USA). The oscillation angle per image was set to 1°, and the data were processed using HKL 2000 [25]. Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking the crystals for 24 h in mother

Phasing and refinement
The native, ethyl mercuric phosphate, 1,4-diacetoxymercuri2,3-dimethoxybutane, and phenylmercury acetate data sets were used for phase calculation (Table 1), which was accomplished by MIRAS using solve [26]. The MIRAS ° map at 1.9 A was subjected to maximum-likelihood density modification, followed by autotracing using resolve [27]. An initial model was built using xtal view [28], after which several cycles of rigid-body refinement, positional refine° ment and simulated annealing were performed at 1.9 A resolution using refmac [29] and cns [30]. The model was adjusted in xtal view using both |Fo| ) |Fc| and 2|Fo| ) |Fc| maps. NAD and citrate molecules were clearly visible in both the rA-weighted |Fo| ) |Fc| and 2|Fo| ) |Fc| maps, and these molecules were included in the latter part of the refinement. The current model contains 472 residues (A 1­236 and B 1­236), 136 water molecules, two NAD and two citrate molecules. The model geometry was analyzed using procheck [31], and 91.2% of the nonglycine residues were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot and 8.8% in the additionally allowed region. Molecular graphics were created using pymol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/). The coordinates and structure factors of A. fulgidus l-aspDH complexed with NAD and citrate have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 2DC1.

Data collection was performed at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan). We thank Drs K. Demura, N. Matsugaki, N. Igarashi and S. Wakatsuki for their kind assistance with the data collection.

Structural analysis and comparison
Ion-pair interactions within the two structures were identified using the WHAT IF web server [32] with a cut-off ° distance ¼ 4.0 A [33] between oppositely charged residues. Aromatic interactions were defined using a cut-off dis° tance of 7.0 A between the aromatic ring centers [22]. Hydrogen bonds were identified using the program insight ii (Biosym / MSI, San Diego, CA, USA). Hydrogen was added to the coordinates of the proteins and the calculated hydrogen bonds (the distance between a calculated hydrogen position and model oxygen or nitrogen ° atom was < 3.0 A, and the angle between the proton donor and acceptor is > 120°) were measured using the criterion of insight ii. The solvent accessible surface area was calculated using the program grasp [34].

Thermal stability
To assess the thermostability, the A. fulgidus or T. maritima l-aspDH (0.1 mgÆmL)1) in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.2 m NaCl was incubated at 100 °C, after which the residual activity of the enzymes was
