Abstract It has been proposed that a hydrophobic groove surrounded by positively charged amino acids on thioredoxin (Trx) serves as the recognition and docking site for the interaction of Trx with target proteins. This model for Trx-protein interactions fits well with the Trx-mediated fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) activation, where a protruding negatively charged loop of FBPase would bind to this Trx groove, in a process involving both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. This model facilitates the prediction of Trx amino acid residues likely to be involved in enzyme binding. Site-directed mutagenesis of some of these amino acids, in conjunction with measurements of the FBPase activation capacity of the wild type and mutated Trxs, was used to check the model and provided evidence that lysine-70 and arginine-74 of pea Trx m play an essential role in FBPase binding. The binding parameters for the interaction between chloroplast FBPase and the wild type pea Trxs f and m, as well as mutated pea Trx m, determined by equilibrium dialysis in accordance with the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer model of saturation kinetics, provided additional support for the role of these basic Trx residues in the interaction with FBPase. These data, in conjunction with the midpoint redox potential (Em ) determinations of Trxs, support the hydrophobic groove model for the interaction between chloroplast FBPase and Trx. This model predicts that differences in the FBPase activation capacity of Trxs arise from their different binding abilities. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Thioredoxins (Trxs) are ubiquitous small proteins (Mr W12 kDa) with a highly conserved active site -W-C-G-P-C- [1]. These proteins, which are of a similar size and folding [1], participate in many cellular processes involving a redox thiol-disul¢de exchange [2,3], but are also involved in some non-redox structural roles [4,5]. Two Trx systems have been extensively described in plants [6]. Trxs h are cytosolic and display a high degree of polymorphism, with up to

¢ve di¡erent isoforms in Arabidopsis [7]. The biological function of Trxs h is not well understood [8], but recently the Arabidopsis Trx3 h has been identi¢ed as coupled to 2-Cys peroxiredoxin, a type of peroxidase involved in H2 O2 detoxi¢cation [9]. The function of chloroplast Trxs f and m is well understood and their crucial role in the modulation of activity of regulatory chloroplast enzymes of the Calvin cycle and related processes has been extensively documented. Even though their divergent phylogeny [10], Trxs f and m show similar tertiary structures [11] and a high degree of in vitro cross-reactions. Trx f is functional in the activation of photosynthetic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and other Calvin cycle enzymes, whereas Trx m displays a high ability in activating NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP MDH). Nevertheless, Trx f has been reported to activate NADP -MDH at a higher rate than Trx m [12,13]. Similarly, Trx m has been recently shown as more e¤cient than Trx f in phosphoribulokinase activation [14]. Likewise, Trx m has proved its e¤ciency in spinach FBPase activation in the presence of the modulators Ca2 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate [15], and even in the absence of modulators in the pea protein assay [16]. Chloroplast FBPase (EC 3.1.3.11), a homotetramer of about 160 kDa molecular mass, is a key enzyme of the Benson-Calvin pathway [17]. It is only active in the light, which occurs because of the increase in pH and Mg2 concentration in the stroma of the chloroplast during the dark-light transition, and also because of reduction of a regulatory -S-S- bridge of FBPase, which produces a conformational change to an active form [18,19]. Reducing equivalents photochemically generated in the chloroplast membranes are channelled by ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase to thioredoxin, which in turn reduces the enzyme via a thioldisul¢de interchange. This reductive interchange is a two-step process. In the ¢rst one there is an interaction between both proteins, which must recognize and bind each other. Because of the low concentration of Trxs and FBPase in the chloroplast stromal space (between 100 and 160 WM of the former, and about 20 times lower of the latter) [20], this interaction is necessary for a good mechanistic yield of the activation process. Although still under investigation, it appears likely that the FBPase binding site is a negatively charged cluster positioned in a protruding loop (`170 loop') in

the middle of each FBPase subunit, which contains the two cysteine residues that seem to be involved in the thiol-disul¢de exchange [21]. There is, however, little information on the docking site(s) for FBPase on Trx. Some investigators [22,23] have approached the subject by using site-directed mutagenesis on Escherichia coli Trx, which is structurally related to chloroplast Trxs. Others investigators [13,15] have carried out parallel experiments on Trxs f and m from spinach and pea. With the exception of the work of Geck et al. [13], the bulk of these studies are focused on the electrostatic interactions between Trxs and the target en¨ ¨ zymes. Despite the demonstration by Pla and Lopez¨ Gorge [24] that hydrophobic forces also play an essential role in FBPase-Trx interaction, relatively little work has been done on possible hydrophobic interaction domains. In accordance with the two-step hypothesis, the di¡erent abilities of Trxs to activate FBPase may be due to two di¡erent factors. On the one hand, they can display di¡erences in the enzyme binding capacity. A good correlation between the binding constant for each Trx with their FBPase activation ability would be a con¢rmation of this assumption. A second possibility is that Trxs displayed di¡erent redox potential. However, recent measurements [25] indicate that Trx f and Trx m have very similar Em values. The small di¡erence (10 mV) found between them cannot explain the great di¡erence in FBPase activation capacity that Trx f and Trx m display. In this work the interaction features of Trxs f and m with the target FBPase have been checked by determination of the binding constants for the interaction between FBPase and both wild type and a series of mutated Trxs, and by comparing the binding constants to the ability of the Trxs to activate FBPase. In addition, to insure that di¡erences in FBPase activation do not arise from any di¡erences in the thermodynamic driving force for FBPase disul¢de reduction, we have measured the redox potentials of the wild type and mutated Trxs. 2.

ing material was a cDNA clone encoding for pea Trx m previously cloned into the vector pTZ18R (T3 ) [26]. The mutations K70Q, K70E, E63Q and R74E were built up by independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampli¢cation of the N-terminal and Cterminal halves of each mutated Trx, using the T3 recombinant as template [26]. The ampli¢cations were performed in the presence of the NdeI-carrying N-terminal, or the BamHI-carrying C-terminal, end-speci¢c oligonucleotides earlier described [16], in conjunction with the following internal ones: 5P-CTGCAACGCAGTATGGA-3P (AAGCCAG) and 3P-GACGTTGCGTCATACCT-5P (TTCCGTC) for K70Q, 5P-CTGCAACGGAGTATGGA-3P (AAGCGAG) and 3P-GACGTTGCCTCATACCT5P (TTCCCTC) for K70E, 5P-ACACAGATCAATCTCCA-3P (GAACCAA) and 3P-TGTGTCTAGTTAGAGGT-5P (CTTCGTT) for E63Q, and 5PATGGAATCGAAAGCATA-3P (AGACGAA) and 3P-TACCTTACCTTTCGTAT-5P (TCTCCTT) for R74E, where mutated bases appear in italics. In each case the two halves were fused by additional PCR, with the N-terminal and C-terminal end-speci¢c oligonucleotides as templates. A new plasmid was constructed using the high yield expression vector pET-12a as previously reported [16]. To check the in-frame presence of the coding cDNA fragment in the pET-Trx constructions, E. coli MC1022 cells were transformed with these new recombinant plasmids and the plasmidic DNAs puri¢ed in minipreparations. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI and puri¢cation by agarose gel electrophoresis, the DNA fragments were sequenced. 2.2. Expression and puri¢cation of Trx m mutants The host for expression of Trx m mutants was the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with the recombinant pET-Trx m wild type and mutants. After overnight incubation, 50 ml of cell cultures were inoculated into 1 l aliquots of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 Wg/ml ampicillin, and grown at 37³C until absorbance between 0.8 and 1.0. Protein expression was then induced by addition of 100 WM isopropyl-L-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG). After 6 h growth cells were harvested by 10 min centrifugation at 5000Ug. The pellet was resuspended in 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 300 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM 2-mer-

captoethanol (henceforth Trx bu¡er), supplemented with 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl £uoride (PMSF). To overcome their lower solubility, the NaCl concentration was increased to 500 mM in the cases of E63Q and R74E Trx m mutants. Cells were broken by two passages through a French press at 60 mPa, and the lysate was clari¢ed by 30 min centrifugation at 20 000Ug. The soluble fraction was heated at 85³C for 10 min, and the denaturated proteins eliminated by centrifugation at 15 000Ug. The supernatant was then fractionated with (NH4 )2 SO4 (40^85% saturation), and the ¢nal precipitate dissolved in Trx bu¡er. After desalting by ¢ltration through a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with the same bu¡er, fractions containing Trx were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and collected. The mixture of active fractions was precipitated with 85% saturation (NH4 )2 SO4 , and extensively dialyzed against Trx bu¡er with only 100 mM NaCl. To eliminate nucleic acids the solution was loaded on a DEAE-cellulose column (2U4 cm) equilibrated in the same bu¡er. Elution of Trx was carried out with a linear gradient of the equilibration bu¡er, between 100 and 600 mM NaCl. Fractions containing Trx were pooled and concentrated by dialysis against high-viscosity carboxymethylcellulose. Wild type Trxs f and m were expressed and puri¢ed as previously described [12,16]. SDSPAGE was performed according to Laemmli [27], and silver staining carried out by the procedure of Blum et al. [28]. Protein was determined by Bradford [29] and by absorbance reading at 280 nm. 2.3. Assay of Trx activity The capacity of Trx to activate FBPase was tested by the two-step procedure of Hertig and Wolosiuk [30]. Ten Wmol of Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.25 Wmol of dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.04 Wmol of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.005 Wmol of CaCl2 , 1.6 Wg (equivalent to 1035 Wmol) of pea FBPase, and increasing concentrations (between 0.1 and 18 Wg) of pea wild type or Trx m mutants, in a ¢nal volume of 0.1 ml, were preincubated for 10 min at 28³C. The catalytic step was carried out by addition of 0.9 ml solution containing: 50 Wmol of Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 Wmol of MgCl2 , 0.36 Wmol of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,

0.02 Wmol of EGTA, 0.3 Wmol of NADP , 0.7 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 1.4 units of phosphohexose isomerase. The activity was measured through the ¢rst 1 min recording of the absorbance increase at 340 nm. Pea chloroplast FBPase was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and puri¢ed as described in a previous work [31]. 2.4. Equilibrium dialysis assays The equilibrium dialysis experiments were carried out using a Dianorm equilibrium dialyzer (Diachema, Zurich), with 1 ml working volume per half cell. We used Spectra/Por cellulose ester (CE) membranes (Spectrum, Laguna Hills, CA), with a molecular mass cuto¡ of 25 000 Da. Previous experiments using membranes with a cuto¡ of 100 000 Da yielded no signi¢cant di¡erences (data not shown). Membranes were washed twice with deionized water for 30 min, and incubated overnight in dialysis bu¡er (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 75 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM DTT, 0.4 mM fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.05 mM CaCl2 ). Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and Ca2 were added to stabilize the complex [16], and NaCl was added in order to minimize the Donnan e¡ect [32]. All binding experiments were performed using a constant concentration of FBPase (CFBPase = 0.625 WM) in one side of the cell, and varying initial concentrations of Trx (1^33 WM). In order to start in a quasi-equilibrium state, equal concentrations of Trx (C0 ) were put in both compartments at the beginning of the experiment. After 6 h incubation at 28³C (enough time to achieve equilibrium, as demonstrated by previous experiments), the concentration of free Trx (CF ) was determined in the compartment without FBPase. A parallel standard curve without FBPase was obtained by using similar known concentrations of Trx in both sides of the cell. The plots of protein reading vs. Trx content was linear in the range of concentrations used. The concentration of bound Trx was calculated by the equation: C B  2C 0 32C F The saturation fraction (a) was determined by the equation:

FBPase, the a value ranged between 0 and 1. The data of a vs. CF were ¢tted to a Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) model [33], as described below. 2.5. Redox potential measurements The midpoint redox potential (Em ) was measured over the pH range from 5.5 to 8.5 for the wild type pea Trx m and mutants. The redox titrations were carried out using a modi¢cation [25] of the monobromobimane (mBBr) £uorescence method [34]. Redox equilibration was carried out for 30 min at a total DTT concentration of 2 mM. Under these, the Em values obtained were not a¡ected by time over the time range from 15 min to 1 h, consistent with the attainment at redox equilibrium between the Trxs (present at a concentration of 12.5 WM) and the DTT redox bu¡ers. The Em values observed were independent of total DTT concentration over the range from 1 mM to 5 mM. 3. Results The mutated amino acids of pea Trx m were the two basic Lys-70 and Arg-74 (K70Q, K70E and R74E), and the acidic Glu-63 (E63Q). The wild type and mutated clones were inserted in the high expression vector pET-12a, were expressed with good yield in E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and the expressed proteins were puri¢ed to homogeneity from the cell lysates.The results of Trx-mediated FBPase activation are shown in Fig. 1. The mutated K70E (K0X5 = 0.145 WM) and R74E (K0X5 = 0.556 WM) Trx m displayed less activation capacity than the wild type Trx m (K0X5 = 0.100 WM). In contrast the E63Q mutation (K0X5 = 0.057 WM) enhanced the FBPase activation ability of Trx m, but surprisingly the K70Q mutant (K0X5 = 0.077 WM) did not decrease its activation capacity. Rather, the replacement of K70 by the uncharged glutamine clearly increased the Trx-mediated activation of FBPase compared to wild type Trx m. The experimental data obtained from equilibrium dialysis experiments were ¢tted to a KNF model, with four identical binding sites of constant K on the FBPase quaternary structure, and two additional parameters, cA and cB , for the interaction between

The experimental data for a vs. CF were ¢tted to this equation by non-linear regression using the Marquardt algorithm, included in the statistical package Statgraphics 7.0, run on a Pentium PC. The results are shown in Fig. 3 and in Table 1, which displays the three parameters for the interaction of each Trx m with FBPase. Despite the experimental uncertainties in the KNF parameters and in the binding constants calculated from them, the data were su¤ciently reliable so that comparison between wild type and Trx m mutants were meaningful. Identical experiments were carried out to measure the properties of the interaction between FBPase and wild type pea Trx f, whose results are also shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 5 shows the results of redox midpoint potential titrations of wild type pea Trx m at several di¡erent pH values.

When a Trx molecule is bound to one monomer, the binding constant of the adjacent subunits are modi¢ed by the value of c. The asymmetry of the FBPase tetramer is considered to assign the di¡erent parameters of interaction.

The Em values for the ¢ve forms of Trx m can be ¢tted to a single straight line, with a slope of 360 mV/pH unit, the value expected for a process in which two protons are taken up per disul¢de reduced.

4. Discussion Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on the interaction between human Trx and the transcription factors NfUB and Ref-1 [36,37] have shown that the binding takes place through a hydrophobic groove located on the active site face of the Trx molecule. Surprisingly, the docking sites of the two transcription factors bound to Trx in opposite orientation, showing the great versatility of Trx in attaching target peptides. Doublie et al. [38] have shown in the crystallized complex between E. coli Trx and the phage T7 DNA polymerase, that the former bound to the latter through a hydrophobic groove located at equivalent position in the bacterial Trx. This indicates that the Trx docking site is highly conserved despite the di¡erent functions of Trx in protein-protein interaction. This hydrophobic groove was surrounded by positively charged amino acids, which probably play an important role in the speci¢c recognition of the di¡erent targets. The proteins that form complexes with Trxs do so through a protruding loop containing both hydrophobic and charged patches, which is accommodated by the Trx groove.

The suitability of this model for the FBPase-Trx interaction has been tested by site-directed mutagenesis of some amino acids from Trx m, followed by analyzing the ability of mutated Trxs to activate the

enzyme. The mutated amino acids were the two basic Lys-70 and Arg-74, predicted to be involved in FBPase binding [16], and the acidic Glu-63, which provided a negative charge that may lead to an un-

favorable interaction. The Lys-70 mutations were K70Q and K70E, the ¢rst introducing a non-charged residue, and the second replacing the positive charge of lysine with the negative one of glutamic acid. The same charge reversal occurs with the mutation R74E, in which the positively charged arginine was replaced by the negatively charged glutamic acid. Finally, the E63Q mutation eliminated the possible repulsive negative charge of glutamic acid, replacing it with the uncharged glutamine [22]. In accordance with the predictive model, the mutated K70E and R74E Trxs were less e¤cient than the wild type Trx m in FBPase activation, since both mutations involved not only the disappearance of one of the two electrostatic bonds engaged in the interaction with the enzyme, but also the insertion of one repulsive negatively charged amino acid at the proposed docking site. It should be noted that Arg-74 appeared to contribute to FBPase activation to a greater extent than did Lys-70. Perhaps this

resulted from the larger volume of the guanidino group of arginine, compared to the amino group of lysine, a fact that may result in the positive charge of arginine protruding to a greater extent from the Trx surface and thus being more available for the interaction with the enzyme. The K0X5 value for the wild type Trx m was lower than the 0.53 WM found by Haberlein and Vogeler [39] with the homologous spi« nach FBPase and Trx m, thus explaining the higher FBPase activation capability of pea Trx m compared to that from spinach. Also in accordance with the model, the E63Q mutation enhanced the Trx m ability of FBPase activation as predicted, because of the disappearance of the repulsive negative charge of Glu-63 from the Trx surface. Surprisingly, and in view of the elimination of the positively charged Lys-70 in the K70Q mutant, this mutation did not drop the FBPase activation ability by Trx m. On the contrary, the appearance of the uncharged glutamine instead of the positively charged arginine increased

164

the FBPase activation ability of the wild type Trx m. A plausible explanation is that hydrogen bond formation may occur between the g-amido group of the neutral Gln-70, and some other available hydrogenbonding group of the FBPase loop. This result, although unexpected, does not invalidate the model proposed for the interaction. Indeed, the observation that this mutation at K70 a¡ected the ability of Trx to activate FBPase can be taken as providing additional evidence for the role of this residue in the TrxFBPase interaction. Bunik et al. [40] have recently described a close correlation between the ability of di¡erent Trxs to activate the mitochondrial 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase system, and the orientation and magnitude of the electrostatic dipole vector of Trxs. In this case not only the charged residues surrounding the active cysteines, but also those positioned in other parts of the proteins, would be involved. In any case both the pea wild type Trx m and the E63Q and K70Q Trx m mutants displayed higher K0X5 values than the pea wild type Trx f (0.030 WM) [41], which strengthens the higher e¤ciency of the latter in FBPase activation. The mechanism of chloroplast FBPase activation is a two-step process [42]. First comes an activation step, by which the enzyme becomes reduced to an active form via the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. This activation phase can, in turn, be subdivided into an initial step, by which the enzyme interacts with Trx, and a subsequent one for the thiol-disul¢de interchange. As a consequence, measurements of the e¡ects of mutation on enzyme activation cannot lead to de¢nitive conclusions in the absence of independent measures of Trx-FBPase binding constants, as well as determinations of redox potentials of the mutated Trxs. A suitable method to measure the binding constants in the interaction between these two proteins is based upon the di¡erences in their molecular masses. FBPase is a relatively big homotetramer (160 kDa), whereas Trxs are quite small monomeric proteins of about 12 kDa. This di¡erence in molecular masses makes possible the use of equilibrium dialysis to quantify the interaction, provided that an appropriate semipermeable membrane has been selected [43]. Previous experiments showed the suitability of a 25 kDa cuto¡ membrane, which allows the free passage of Trx across the membrane, whereas FBPase is completely retained.

The results of Fig. 3 and Table 1 show signi¢cant di¡erences between the binding constants of all the mutant forms and that of the wild type Trx. Two of the mutants (E63Q and K70Q) display greater a¤nity for FBPase than the wild type Trx m, while the other two mutants (K70E and R74E) show lower binding constants (Table 1). Moreover, these results clearly correlate with the FBPase activation ability measured for these mutants. In order to determine if these di¡erences in activation can be adequately explained by di¡erences in binding, we have plotted the FBPase activation capability of each Trx (measured as the reciprocal of K0X5 ) vs. the binding constant for each mutant (Fig. 4). A straight line was obtained with a correlation coe¤cient R2 of 0.99, thus showing that di¡erences in the activation capacity of mutants can be explained by their di¡erent binding to FBPase. The value measured for the binding constant, K, in the FBPase-Trx f interaction was twice as large as that obtained for wild type Trx m-FBPase binding, thus explaining the better capacity of Trx f to activate FBPase. Experimental points ¢t better to the KNF equation in the case of Trx f, since the method is more accurate for greater binding constants. The previously reported value for the activation capacity of Trx f (K0X5 = 0.030 WM) [41] is slightly lower than that expected from the value of its binding constant, as can be seen in Fig. 4. The two parameters, cA and cB , of interaction between subunits displayed di¡erent values in all the cases, which indicated a signi¢cant di¡erence in the strength of interaction between the di¡erent pairs of FBPase subunits. This is in agreement with the fact that the FBPase tetramer dissociates at high pH into two dimers [44], which are resistant to subsequent separation into monomers. Moreover, the quaternary structure of spinach chloroplast FBPase shows a 20³ rotation of the plane of two subunits with respect to the plane of the other two (con¢guration S) [45]. The great value of cB explains the stability of the FBPase tetramer in the presence of Trx [46], with binding of one or two Trxs to the FBPase tetramer producing a large e¡ect on the adjacent subunits, strengthening the attractive forces between them and thus stabilizing the tetramer. The structure of spinach FBPase determined by Villeret et al. [45] shows the `170 loop' of each enzyme

subunit as a £exible, non-rigid portion of the enzyme. However, the more recent structure of pea FBPase shows the presence of an K-helix in this loop, which could in£uence the interaction between subunits [47]. The results of the redox midpoint potentials obtained for wild type Trx m and mutants were similar to that found for corn Trx m [48], and are in good agreement with those obtained by Hirasawa et al. [25] for spinach and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Trx m. Thus, despite the di¡erences in sequences, the redox properties of Trx m are very conserved among species. The small di¡erences between the Em values at di¡erent pH values of the di¡erent mutants were less than the experimental error of the method, thus proving that the site-directed mutations do not modify the redox potential of the active site cysteines. This can be expected from the fact that mutations a¡ect amino acids relatively far from the active site, even though located round the hydrophobic groove proposed to be involved in the interaction with FBPase. These results are in disagreement with the theoretical ones of Gane et al. [49], which predicted that dipoles set up by a peptide located in a region of about 20 residues close to the active site contributed signi¢cantly to the redox potential value. In summary, we can conclude that the electrostatic dependence of the hydrophobic groove model for the interaction between FBPase and Trx ¢ts well with the experimental data. The E63Q and K70Q mutants displayed an enhanced ability to activate FBPase in comparison with that of wild type Trx m, because of their higher binding ability. In contrast, K70E and R74E showed a decreased capacity of activation due to their lower binding ability. In all the cases the redox potentials had similar values. These results strengthen the hypothesis that the mutated amino acids are actually involved in the recognition and docking of Trx m to FBPase, thus reinforcing the plausibility of theoretical models.
