Optimization of a previously reported thrombin inhibitor, 9-hydroxy-9-fluorenylcarbonyl-Lprolyl-trans-4-aminocyclohexylmethylamide (1), by replacing the aminocyclohexyl P1 group provided a new lead structure, 9-hydroxy-9-fluorenylcarbonyl-L-prolyl-2-aminomethyl-5-chlorobenzylamide (2), with improved potency (Ki ) 0.49 nM for human thrombin, 2× APTT ) 0.37 µM in human plasma) and pharmacokinetic properties (F ) 39%, iv T1/2 ) 13 h in dogs). An effective strategy for reducing plasma protein binding of 2 and improving efficacy in an in vivo thrombosis model in rats was to replace the lipophilic fluorenyl group in P3 with an azafluorenyl group. Systematic investigation of all possible azafluorenyl P3 isomers and azafluorenyl-N-oxide analogues of 2 led to the identification of an optimal compound, 3-aza9-hydroxyfluoren-9(R)-ylcarbonyl-L-prolyl-2-aminomethyl-5-chlorobenzylamide (19b), with high potency (Ki ) 0.40 nM, 2× APTT ) 0.18 µM), excellent pharmacokinetic properties (F ) 55%, T1/2 ) 14 h in dogs), and complete efficacy in the in vivo thrombosis model in rats (inhibition of FeCl3-induced vessel occlusions in six of six rats receiving an intravenous infusion of 10 µg/kg/min of 19b). The stereochemistry of the azafluorenyl group in 19b was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis of its N-oxide derivative (23b) bound in the active site of human thrombin.
Introduction The serine protease, thrombin, is a critical enzyme in the coagulation cascade. The primary components of a vascular thrombus, activated platelets and fibrin, are both produced by mechanisms involving proteolysis catalyzed by thrombin. Inhibitors of thrombin have long been recognized as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of a variety of thrombotic disorders, and indeed, intravenous and oral thrombin inhibitors have recently progressed through human clinical trials and reached the marketplace.1,2 Our goal has been to identify a once a day oral thrombin inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics and no clinically meaningful food or drug interactions. Such a compound would offer significant advantages over the two most widely employed antithrombotic drugs, low molecular weight heparin (the requirement for parenteral administration precludes its use on a chronic basis) and warfarin

(frequent patient monitoring is required because of its slow onset of action, variable interpatient doseresponse, and significant food and drug interactions). Several years ago we reported the optimization of a series of thrombin inhibitors containing an L-prolyltrans-4-aminocyclohexylmethylamide P2-P1 scaffold, using parallel solid-phase synthesis methods to vary the P3 portion of the molecule.3 An interesting inhibitor which incorporates a 9-hydroxyfluorenyl group in P3 was identified from this work (1, see Figure 1). In an isolated enzyme assay 1 inhibited human thrombin with a Ki value of 1.5 nM and 1 had good selectivity for inhibiting thrombin versus a panel of other human serine proteases (Ki ) 860 nM trypsin; Ki g 20 µM for plasmin, tPA, activated protein C, plasma kallikrein, and chymotrypsin). In functional assays, 1 inhibited coagulation of human plasma triggered by the intrinsic pathway with a doubling of the activated partial thromboplastin time (2× APTT) at a concentration of 0.85 µM, and in an arterial thrombosis model in rats, an intravenous infusion of 10 µg/kg/min of 1 inhibited FeCl3induced vessel occlusion in six of six animals. The 9-hydroxyfluorenyl group also engendered 1 with superior pharmacokinetic properties compared to numerous P3 variants in this P2-P1 structural series (F ) 74%,

iv T1/2 ) 2 h in dogs; F ) 39%, iv T1/2 ) 4 h in cynomologus monkeys). X-ray crystallographic analysis of 1 bound to the active site of human thrombin showed one of the benzene rings of the P3 hydroxyfluorenyl group to be binding in the hydrophobic S3 pocket of the enzyme, the other benzene ring contacting the hydrophobic residues Tyr-60A and Trp-60D contained in the loop which also contacts the P2 proline, the hydroxyl group hydrogen bonding to the carbonyl of Gly-216, and the P1 aminocyclohexyl moiety binding in the S1 pocket of the enzyme with the amino group interacting with Asp189. Having optimized the P3-P2 portion of the molecule with the 9-hydroxyfluorenyl-prolyl moiety, we began to screen new P1 group analogues of 1 for improved performance. Our laboratories were also developing new P1 structures based on the previously reported 2,5dichlorobenzylamide template,4 replacing the chlorine at position 2 with a variety of new substituents. An interesting finding from this work was that an aminomethyl or aminoethyl group at position 2 brought about a large increase in binding potency by forming a salt bridge with a surface glutamate on the enzyme as well as making several other inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds.5 Incorporation of these new P1 groups into the 9-hydroxyfluorenyl-prolyl P3-P2 scaffold gave 2 and 3 (Figure 1). The aminomethyl analogue 2 displayed superior potency compared to the aminoethyl analogue 3 and 1 in both the isolated enzyme and the 2× APTT assays. Both 2 and 3 exhibited excellent pharmacokinetic properties in dogs (2, F ) 39%; iv T1/2 ) 13 h; 3, F ) 39%; iv T1/2 ) 14 h) with plasma halflives improved by 6-fold compared to 1. The free P1 amino group and the P3 fluorenyl group in 2 were found to be important structural features for obtaining favorable pharmacokinetic properties. For example, replacing the basic P1 amino group with an acetamido group (4, Figure 1), in addition to reducing potency, brought about a dramatic reduction of exposure in the systemic circulation and plasma half-life after an oral dose of 1 mg/kg in dogs (AUC ) 0.04 µM,h, T1/2 ) 0.48 h) compared to 2 (AUC ) 32 µM,h, T1/2 ) 13 h). Likewise, a simple alteration of the P3 group involving opening of the tricyclic fluorenyl ring (5, Figure 1), while having little effect on potency, also reduced systemic

exposure and plasma half-life after a 1 mg/kg oral dose in dogs (AUC ) 13 µM,h, T1/2 ) 4.2 h) compared to 2. Both 2 and 3 showed reduced efficacy for inhibiting FeCl3-induced thrombosis in rats compared to 1. While an intravenous infusion of 10 µg/kg/min of 1 was fully efficacious in six rats (0/6 occlusions), the same dose of 2 and 3 resulted in vessel occlusions in 4/5 and 6/6 animals, respectively. Possibly contributing to the poor efficacy was the fact that both 2 and 3 were more highly bound to blood plasma proteins (2, 1% free in human plasma, 9% free in rat plasma; 3, 3% free in human plasma, 15% free in rat plasma) than 1 (8% free in human plasma, 27% free in rat plasma). From our previous work, we were aware that reducing inhibitor lipophilicity can lessen plasma protein binding and improve efficacy in both the 2× APTT assay and the FeCl3-induced thrombosis assay in rats.6 One way to accomplish this in the present series was to replace the fluorenyl ring in P3 with an azafluorenyl ring. It was thought that this type of modification would reduce lipophilicity while maintaining, as much as possible, the structural features important for good intrinsic potency and good pharmacokinetic properties. Additionally, since it is well-known that pyridine derivatives are capable of being metabolized to their corresponding N-oxides, analogues containing an azafluorenyl-N-oxide group in P3 were also of interest. Herein we detail the synthesis and biological properties of analogues of lead compound 2 which contain all possible isomers of 9-hydroxyazafluorene and the corresponding N-oxides in the P3 position. Synthetic Chemistry The Boc protected prolylchlorobenzylamide derivative 7 served as a key common intermediate for the compounds in Table 1. Compound 7 was prepared in a straightforward fashion using 2-(tert-butyloxycarbonylaminomethyl)-5-chlorobenzylamine 67 as depicted in eq 1 of Scheme 1. Acylation of 7 with 9-hydroxyfluorene9-carboxylic acid using standard peptide coupling conditions followed by removal of the Boc protecting group under acidic conditions gave 2 in very good overall yield. Synthesis of azafluorenyl P3 analogues of 2 was envisioned as utilizing azafluorenones as key intermediates. The keto group of the azafluorenone could in principle be converted to a cyanohydrin and then hydrolyzed to a hydroxy acid for coupling to amine 7. Several methods for preparing azafluorenones have been reported,8 and the method which proved to be the best suited for our purposes was that which utilizes an intramolecular Friedel-Crafts reaction of a pyridine substrate containing adjacent carboxy and phenyl substituents. Synthesis of the 4-azafluorene-containing inhibitors, 20a,b and 24a,b, is shown in eq 2 of Scheme 1. 2-Chloro-3-cyanopyridine underwent efficient Suzuki coupling with phenylboronic acid followed by acid hydrolysis to give the Friedel-Crafts substrate 8. Hot polyphosphoric acid induced efficient cyclization of 8 to 4-azafluorenone 9. A more direct method of synthesizing 9 was also developed which involves a one-step oxidative ring contraction of 7,8-benzoquinoline using basic permanganate, reaction conditions analogous to what has

lation to alcohol 12. Additionally, the coupling of 11 to proline derivative 7 under a variety of conditions produced the desired product 16 in very low yields (<5%) due to competitive decarboxylation of 11 during the reaction. While the parent, 9-hydroxyfluorene-9carboxylic acid, is chemically stable and well-behaved in peptide coupling reactions, the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitrogen in the 4-azafluorenyl analogue 11 was found to vastly increase the propensity for decarboxylation, making peptide couplings extremely difficult. At the time this work was ongoing, a report on the preparation of 9-amino-4,5-di-azafluorenyl-9-carboxamide peptide derivatives appeared.12 The coupling procedure in this report avoided the intermediacy of a carboxylic acid and instead employed a hydrazide which was converted to an acyl azide as the reactive acylating species. A similar approach was adopted in our work and resulted in greatly improved yields. The treatment of trimethylsilyl cyanohydrin 10 with HCl gas in methanol provided hydroxy ester 13, and heating 13 with excess hydrazine produced hydrazide 14. Treatment of 14 with amyl nitrite at low temperature produced acyl azide 15, the presence of which could be detected by LC-MS, and 15 slowly acylated 7 at low temperature to provide the desired coupling product 16 in 85% isolated yield. Byproducts observed in this reaction were ketone 9 and alcohol 12 which presumably had arisen from Curtius rearrangement and hydrolysis/ decarboxylation reactions of 15, respectively. Removal of the Boc group in 16 followed by chromatographic separation provided the individual 4-azafluorenyl P3 diastereomers 20a and 20b. A portion of each diastereomer was reprotected with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, oxidized with MCPBA, and then deprotected with acid to give the corresponding N-oxide derivatives 24a and 24b. The remainder of the compounds in Table 1 were prepared in a manner analogous to that shown in eq 2 of Scheme 1, starting with the different isomers of 8. The carboxylic acid obtained from methyl 4-phenylpyridine-3-carboxylate,13 was employed as the FriedelCrafts substrate for the preparation of compounds in the 2-azafluorene series (18a,b and 22a,b). Methyl 3-bromopyridine-2-carboxylate and methyl 3-bromopyridine-4-carboxylate, prepared by the method of Epsztajn et al.,14 underwent efficient Suzuki coupling with phenylboronic acid, and following ester group hydrolysis, gave the appropriate Freidel-Crafts substrates for the preparation of compounds in the 1-azafluorene series (17a,b and 21a,b), and 3-azafluorene series (19a,b and 23a,b), respectively. 7-Chloro-4-azafluorenone was prepared by the method of DuPriest et al.15 and was used to obtain 25a and 25b. Yields in the acyl azide coupling reaction with proline derivative 7 were found to be substrate dependent. Higher yields were obtained with the 1- and 4-azafluorenyl isomers (62% and 85%, respectively), and lower yields resulted with the 2- and 3-azafluorenyl isomers (8% and 13%, respectively). Yields with the 2- and 3-azafluorenyl isomers, however, were substantially improved by adding HOAT to the acyl azide to make an active ester,16 prior to the addition of proline coupling partner 7 (30% and 44% yields, respectively, in the presence of HOAT).

Compounds 17a,b-20a,b, and 25a,b in Table 1 were prepared as mixtures of P3 diastereomers. For each mixture, chromatographic conditions were identified which provided the individual diastereomers in pure form. The diastereomers with the 3-azafluorenyl P3 group, 19a,b, although separable, were very closely eluting under a variety of chromatographic conditions, thus making isolation of larger quantities difficult. A more efficient separation was possible at the Bocprotected precursor stage. Alternatively, efficient separation of enantiomers at the hydroxy ester stage (the 3-azafluorene isomer of 13) was accomplished using HPLC on a chiral stationary phase, and further processing of the (-) enantiomer provided access to larger quantities of 19b. Biological Assays Inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined for test compounds in an assay using human derived thrombin, trypsin, urokinase, plasmin, kallikrein, t-PA and chymotrypsin with the corresponding fluorescent or chromogenic substrate under steady state conditions as previously described.17 The concentration of test compound required to double the activated partial thromboplastin time in human plasma, the 2× APTT value, was determined under conditions involving a 3-fold dilution of human plasma as previously reported.18 The antithrombotic activities of intravenously administered test compounds were determined in an anesthetized rat model of topical FeCl3-induced arterial thrombosis.19 Test compounds were administered by intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 µg/kg/min for 180 min, FeCl3 was applied to the carotid artery at 120 min post dose, and carotid artery blood flow was monitored for 60 min. Results are expressed as number of animals which had occluded vessels (n ) 5 or 6). For plasma pharmacokinetic assays, amorphous TFA salts of test compounds were dosed orally in 1% methocel solution to beagle dogs (n ) 2) at 1 mg/kg. Blood samples were obtained over 8 h postdose, and a final blood sample was taken at 24 h. At each time point, test compound was isolated from the plasma fraction by solid-phase extraction and quantified by LC-MS/MS against a standard curve. Area under the curve (AUC) and plasma half-life (T1/2) were determined from analysis of the concentration versus time curve. Plasma protein binding was determined as previously described.6 Standard error in the measurement of thrombin Ki values, 2× APTT values, and oral AUC values is (20%. Results and Discussion Assay results for the diastereomeric pairs of each of the four azafluorenyl positional isomers and selected N-oxide derivatives are collected in Table 1. Comparing the intrinsic potency (Ki vs human thrombin) of the aza analogues 17a,b-20a,b to lead compound 2, it is seen that introduction of nitrogen into the fluorenyl ring system is generally well-tolerated, with potencies ranging from 6-fold less potent (17a, 18a) to 2.5-fold more potent (17b) than 2. The difference in potency between the two diastereomers for each of the four positional isomers progressively decreased as the nitrogen was moved around the fluorenyl ring from the 1-position (17a/17b, difference of 17-fold) to the 4-position (20a/

20b, difference of 1.8-fold). Comparing the more potent diastereomers from each pair of positional isomers, 17b20b, it is seen that potency progressively increased as the nitrogen was moved around the fluorenyl ring from the 4-position (20b, Ki ) 0.78 nM) to the 1-position (17b, Ki ) 0.20 nM). Conversion of each of the azafluorenyl diastereomers 17a,b-20a,b to its corresponding Noxide derivative, 21a,b-24a,b, resulted in a small loss of potency (1.3-fold to 3.3-fold) except for azafluorenes 17a and 18a, where the loss in potency was larger (42fold and 12-fold loss of potency for N-oxides 21a and 22a, respectively). Addition of a chlorine at the 7-position of the 4-azafluorenyl ring produced a very potent inhibitor with diastereomer 25b. For all the compounds in Table 1, excellent selectivity for inhibiting thrombin vs the related serine protease, trypsin, was observed, with selectivity ratios ranging from 1000-fold to 7000fold. Compound 25b displayed the greatest absolute potency for trypsin in the group, with a Ki value of 300 nM. The structure of compound 23b bound in the active site of human thrombin was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis (see Figure 2). The positioning of the P1 aminomethyl chlorobenzyl group in the S1 pocket was found to be virtually identical to that previously observed for a thrombin inhibitor utilizing a pyridinone P2 template,5 with the aminomethyl group in 23b forming a salt bridge with Glu-192 as well as being within hydrogen-bonding distance of four additional H-bond acceptors: the Gly-216 carbonyl oxygen, the proline carbonyl oxygen, the carbonyl oxygen of the azafluorenyl-9-carboxamide, and a crystallographically resolved water molecule. We were somewhat surprised, however, to find that 23b, the more potent of the two diastereomerically related 3-azafluorenyl-N-oxides 23a and 23b, has the R configuration in P3, i.e., the isomer which has the aza-N-oxide ring pointed in toward the S3 pocket. Prior to determination of this structure, visual inspection of the fluorenyl group in the X-ray structure of lead compound 1 bound in the thrombin active site led us to speculate that the R-isomers of the position 1-, 2-, and 3-azafluorenyl-N-oxides might bind less tightly than the corresponding S-isomers because of unfavorable steric interactions of the N-oxide group with the enzyme. The structure of 23b shows the

N-oxide oxygen to be located 2.6 Å from the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Glu-97A which is presumably a destabilizing electrostatic interaction. However, a crystallographically resolved water molecule, shown as a red sphere in Figure 2, is within hydrogen bonding distance (3.1 Å) of the aza-fluorenyl-N-oxide oxygen and may help to stabilize positioning of the N-oxide group in the S3 pocket. This water molecule is also within hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen of Trp-96 (2.5 Å) and the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr-60A (2.8 Å). Also, there is an aromatic ring edge-to-face interaction involving the indole side chain of Trp-60D (edge) and the benzenoid ring portion of the tricyclic azafluorenylN-oxide (face). These two rings are separated by a distance of approximately 3.6 Å as indicated in Figure 2. Of the two diastereomers 23a and 23b, we speculate that the electropositive edge of the Trp-60D side chain would engage in a more favorable electrostatic interaction with the -face of the more electron rich benzenoid ring portion of the tricyclic azafluorenyl-N-oxide ring system in diastereomer 23b than it would with the -face of the more electron deficient N-oxide ring portion of the azafluorenyl-N-oxide group upon binding of diastereomer 23a. Crystal structures of other positional azafluorenyl-N-oxide isomers are needed to more fully understand the relationship between inhibitor P3 interactions with the enzyme and binding potency in this series of compounds. Compared to 2, azafluorenyl analogues 17a,b-20a,b all showed reduced binding to plasma proteins in both human and rat plasma. Human plasma protein binding was particularly high with 2, and as predicted, the free fraction was significantly increased with the introduction of nitrogen into the fluorenyl ring. Conversion of the azafluorenyl analogues to their corresponding Noxides increased the free fraction to an even greater extent. The 4-azafluorenyl analogue 20b and its corresponding N-oxide 24b illustrate this point, with 10-fold and 50-fold increases in the free fraction in human plasma, respectively, compared to 2. Reducing human plasma protein binding had beneficial effects on efficacy in the 2× APTT assay. For example, although the intrinsic potencies of 20b, 22b, 23b, 24b, and 25a are all less than that of 2, the former are all more potent than 2 in the 2× APTT assay. Azafluorenes 17a,b20a,b and N-oxides 21b-24b all showed reduced plasma protein binding in rat plasma compared to 2. The greater free fraction in rat plasma resulted in improved performance in the FeCl3-induced thrombosis assay, even with several compounds (19a,b, 20a,b, 22b, 23b, 24b) of similar or lesser intrinsic potency than 2. Initial screening for pharmacokinetic properties was done in dogs (n ) 2) using a 1 mg/kg oral dose of amorphous test compound as its trifluoroacetate salt in methocel suspension. Area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) and plasma half-life data are given in Table 1. In comparing oral AUC values, it is seen that plasma exposures for all of the azafluorenes 17a,b-20a,b with the exception of 17b and 19a were similar to that of the parent compound 2. AzafluoreneN-oxides 21b-24b, however, showed significantly less plasma exposure after oral dosing compared to 2, and there was a significant drop (10-fold or greater) in AUC for each azafluorene-N-oxide compared to its corre-

in the rat was high, and oral bioavailability was on the low side. But in dogs and rhesus monkeys, the oral bioavailability and plasma half-life of 19b were very favorable. In addition, inhibition of other human serine proteases by 19b was minimal (Ki trypsin ) 2.5 µM; factor Xa ) 8.1 µM; chymotrypsin, kallikrein, plasmin, TPA, urokinase >100 µM). Taking into consideration all of our key assays (2xAPTT potency, FeCl3-induced thrombosis assay in rats, oral bioavailability and plasma half-life in three animal species, stability in human liver microsomes, human plasma protein binding), 19b emerged as the best compound in this series of azafluorenyl P3 inhibitors. Summary and Conclusion Modification of a promising series of previously described P2 proline-based thrombin inhibitors by incorporation of a recently discovered P1 group brought about significant improvements in potency and pharmacokinetic properties. The prototype in this new series, 2, however, was found to lack full efficacy for inhibiting clot formation in an in vivo thrombosis model in rats. Introduction of nitrogen into the tricyclic fluorenyl P3 group of 2 to produce an azafluorenyl ring system proved to be an effective solution to reducing plasma protein binding and restoring full efficacy in the rat thrombosis model. A systematic study of inhibitors containing all possible azafluorene positional isomers, their diastereomers, and N-oxides was undertaken. An optimal compound was identified, 19b, which contains a 3-aza-9-hydroxyfluoren-9(R)-yl P3 group. Determination of the stereochemistry of the azafluorenyl P3 group in 19b was accomplished by X-ray crystallographic analysis of the corresponding azafluorenyl-N-oxide derivative 23b bound in the active site of human thrombin. Compound 19b was found to be a highly potent inhibitor of thrombin in an isolated enzyme assay (Ki ) 0.4 nM) with greater than 5000-fold selectivity for human thrombin vs a panel of other serine proteases. In functional assays, 19b doubled the activated partial thromboplastin time in human plasma at a concentration of 0.18 µM and fully inhibited FeCl3-induced vessel occlusion in rats with an intravenous infusion of 10 µg/ kg/min. Compound 19b showed excellent pharmacokinetic properties in dogs (F ) 55%, iv T1/2 ) 14 h) and rhesus monkeys (F ) 57%, iv T1/2 ) 8.2 h) and more modest pharmacokinetic properties in rats (F ) 22%, iv T1/2 ) 2.7 h). Compound 19b also exhibited good stability in the presence of human liver microsomal preparations and maintained a significant free fraction in human plasma protein binding experiments. Taking into consideration all of these key preclinical properties, 19b represents the best compound to have emerged from our thrombin inhibitor discovery effort to date, and as such offers considerable potential for development as an oral antithrombotic agent. Experimental Section

sponding azafluorene analogue. The azafluorene-Noxides were found to be significantly more polar than the azafluorenes as determined by log P measurements (values of -1.2 to -0.50 for the azafluorene-N-oxides vs 0.2 to 0.5 for the azafluorenes), and so we speculate that the lower plasma exposure of the former may be the result of poor absorption in the gut due to their highly polar nature. Contrary to this argument, however, the plasma exposures of 4-aza-7-chlorofluorenes 25a,b were modest despite their polarities being similar to that of fluorene 2 (log P values of 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5, respectively). Plasma half-lives for azafluorenes 17a,b20a,b and 25a,b fell into three ranges, short (2-4 h, 17b, 18a, 19a, 25a, 25b), intermediate (5-6 h, 17a, 20a, 20b), and long (10-14 h, 18b and 19b). For two of the N-oxides, 21b and 24b, the plasma half-lives were very similar to their corresponding azafluorenyl analogues, and for the other two N-oxides, 22b and 23b, there was a significant reduction in half-life compared to their corresponding azafluorenyl analogues. The pharmacokinetic behavior of azafluorene 20b and its N-oxide derivative 24b was examined in greater detail (see Table 2). In three species, the N-oxide showed significantly reduced (ca. 10-fold) oral bioavailability compared to the unoxidized azafluorene. In dogs and monkeys, the oral bioavailability and half-life of 20b were very good. In rats, however, 20b showed high clearance with a value approaching that of hepatic blood flow, and poor oral bioavailability. In vitro metabolism studies with 20b using human liver microsomes showed efficient conversion to its N-oxide derivative, 24b. The good oral bioavailability and half-life of 20b in two species and the good half-life of its N-oxide metabolite 24b in three species lead one to speculate that 20b dosed in humans might exhibit a pharmacodynamic half-life longer than its pharmacokinetic half-life due to the formation of 24b as a low clearance active metabolite. Gratifyingly, the two azafluorenes which exhibited long plasma half-lives in dogs, 18b and 19b, were also among the most potent thrombin inhibitors in this series of compounds, and both were fully efficacious for inhibiting FeCl3-induced thrombosis in rats. These two compounds, however, were distinguishable from one another in terms of their stability in human liver microsomes, with 18b being degraded rapidly and 19b having good stability. Since this result suggests the potential for a longer half-life for 19b compared to 18b in humans, we decided to pursue 19b further and obtain a more complete set of pharmacokinetic data (see Table 2). As was seen with azafluorene 20b, clearance of 19b
