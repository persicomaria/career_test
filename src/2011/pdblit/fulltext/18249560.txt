Due to a conversion factor error in electrode area, the current density values quoted for Polymers I and II in the above article should be altered from 3.8 mA/cm2 to 0.38 mA/cm2 for Polymer I and from 0.7 mA/cm2 to 0.07 mA/cm2 for Polymer II. Adjustment of the y-axis in Fig. 1 by a decrease by an order of magnitude is also required. The central conclusion of the report still holds, however, with the revised current densities the highest

reported in physiological buffer for a laccase mediated reduction of oxygen at the time of publication. Higher current densities, of 1.5 mA/cm2, through films of an osmium redox polymer co-immobilized with a bacterially expressed laccase, have since been reported on by Gallaway et al. (Biosensors & Bioelectronics, 23 (2008) 1229). The corrected Fig. 1 is shown below:
