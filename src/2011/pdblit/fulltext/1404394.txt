AND METHODS ysozyme from strain 8 ac q e' (wild type), kindly provided by J. Owen an 'G. Streisinger (Eugene,Oregon) was prepared according Phage Td to the procedure of Tsugita et al (10) slightly modified. The enzyme assay used was that by Elwell and Schellman (8). Unfolding was induced by incubating T lysozyme (final concentration 2 PM) in various concentrations of GuHCl at 23" in a 50 mM tris-HCl buffer, 1 mM MgC12, pH 7.4 containing either 1 mM B-mercaptoethanol or 100 uM DTT (for C.D. measurements). GuHCl concentrations were evaluated from refractive index using the tables of Nosaki (11). For equilibrium studies, the denaturing mixtures were incubated for 24 hours. For kinetic studies, zero time was determined by the introduction of the enzyme in the denaturation mixture.

Refolding was monitored for solutions of T lysozyme previously incubated in 6M GuHCl for 24 hours at 23" for comple 8 e unfolding and then diluted in the same buffer, with the GuHCl concentration varying from 1.5 M to 2.4 M. Incubation in regeneration mixture lasted 24 hours in equilibrium studies. For kinetic studies, zero time corresponded to the introduction of the denatured enzyme into the regeneration mixture. Fluorescence was recorded with a Perkin-Elmer MPF 448 spectrbfluorimeter. Circular dichrofsm was measured with a Jouan III super dichrograph. Temperature was kept constant at 23" f 0.1" for all experiments. RESULTS
