Fold and function of polypeptide transport-associated domains responsible for delivering unfolded proteins to membranes

These integral membrane proteins, known as outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), are transported from the cytoplasm across the inner membrane through the SecYEG protein export machinery (Veenendaal et al., 2004). The signal sequences which target them for export are removed at the outer face of the inner membrane. The processed OMP then has to traverse the periplasmic space before being folded and inserted into the outer membrane in a process that is conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Reumann et al., 1999; Paschen et al., 2003; Voulhoux et al., 2003). Recent genetic and biochemical experiments have shown that a multi-protein complex is required for this process. The central component is an integral b-barrel protein commonly known as Omp85. This highly conserved protein is found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and is represented by YaeT in Escherichia coli, Sam50 in mitochondria and Toc75 in chloroplasts. YaeT is essential for viability, as its depletion leads to severe OMP biogenic defects (Kozjak et al., 2003; Paschen et al., 2003; Gentle et al., 2004; Doerrler and Raetz, 2005; Werner and Misra, 2005; Wu et al., 2005). In E. coli, the remaining protein machinery consists of at least four interacting lipoproteins: YfgL, YfiO, NlpB and SmpA, whose precise roles remain to be defined (Wu et al., 2005; Sklar et al., 2007). All members of the Omp85 family contain one or more polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains N-terminal to their transmembrane b barrels (SanchezPulido et al., 2003). Their function is unclear, but seminal studies of Sam50 have shown that its POTRA domain binds unfolded b-barrel precursors, suggesting an important role in protein assembly in the mitochondrial membrane (Habib et al., 2007). Biochemical studies of Toc75 truncations have implicated its POTRA domains as docking sites for proteins destined to be targeted to, or across, membranes (Ertel et al., 2005). Targeted deletions of the five POTRA repeats (POTRA1­POTRA5) of E. coli YaeT have revealed that these domains play scaffolding roles for specific accessory factors, and deletions severely infringe OMP assembly (Kim et al., 2007). Conversely, in Neisseria meningitidis, serial POTRA deletions

Summary
Membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts receive and fold b-barrel transmembrane proteins through the action of polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) domains. In Escherichia coli, folding substrates are inserted into the outer membrane by the essential protein YaeT, a prototypic Omp85 protein. Here, the articulation between tandem POTRA domains in solution is defined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, indicating an unprecedented juxtaposition. The novel solution orientations of all five POTRA domains are revealed by small-angle X-ray scattering of the entire 46 kDa periplasmic region. NMR titration studies show that strands from YaeT's canonical folding substrate, PhoE, bind non-specifically along alternating sides of its mixed b sheets, thus providing an ideal platform for helping to fold nascent outer-membrane proteins. Together, this provides the first structural model of how multiple POTRA domains recruit substrates from the periplasmic solution into the outer membrane.

of Omp85, the YaeT homologue, have shown only POTRA5 to be essential. Nonetheless, the other four POTRA modules play crucial roles in folding larger b-barrel proteins, and the number of POTRA domains retained correlates with correct substrate folding (Bos et al., 2007). Together, this indicates that all five POTRA domains of YaeT and its relatives play crucial, complex and interrelated roles in the assembly and functioning of the b-barrel folding apparatus. The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of the first four POTRA domains of YaeT and of FhaC has provided valuable insights into the POTRA domain-containing family of proteins (Clantin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007). However, the orientation of the essential POTRA5 domain, the linker orientations and inter-domain interactions in solution and the substrate binding mechanism all remain unclear. Here, we report the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of tandem POTRA domains of YaeT and the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) conformation of all five POTRA domains, and reveal how OMP sequences pair with alternating sides of the mixed b sheets of adjacent domains. This provides the first mechanistic insights of how OMP precursors could be transferred into the core Omp85 machinery by the intact POTRA assembly.

Results
The monomeric POTRA domains of YaeT possess a highly stable fold Two constructs from E. coli YaeT encompassing residues 1­174 (POTRA1-2) and 1­424 (POTRA1-5) were overexpressed and purified to homogeneity with yields of 11 and 7.5 mg l-1. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein confirmed the correct processing of the signal sequence between residues 20 and 21. The secondary structures of POTRA1-2 and POTRA1-5 were determined using circular dichroism (Fig. S1), revealing folded proteins with mixed a-helical/b-strand structures, which is consistent with in silico structural predictions. Previous investigations demonstrated that Omp85-like proteins possessed a tetrameric organization. Having established that the purified POTRA domains were folded, we investigated whether the observed oligomeric state was due to interactions between the POTRA domains. Size exclusion chromatography indicated both constructs eluted as monomers. Furthermore, this was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) when, at all concentrations studied, both POTRA1-2 and POTRA1-5 migrated as monomers with mass profiles consistent with their predicted molecular weights of 18 and 46.2 kDa respectively (Fig. 1). Optimum conditions for protein NMR involve slightly acidic pH to decrease the exchange rates of the backbone

ThermoFluor screening was used to optimize buffer conditions to make POTRA1-2 suitable for study by NMR. Based on this fluorescence-based thermal stability assay (Pantoliano et al., 2001), the POTRA domain has a remarkably stable fold under a variety of solution conditions. POTRA1-2 showed a classical melting curve with a single inflection at a temperature of 73.5°C in the absence of additives (Fig. 2A and Table 1), suggesting that both the N-terminal POTRA domains unfold at similar and unusually high temperatures. Upon screening approximately 100 commonly used NMR solutions, only minor effects of pH, buffer and salt concentration on the unfolding temperature

The POTRA1 structure is slightly smaller than POTRA2, and contains a different a1 helix orientation. In POTRA1, a1 is composed of a single turn of five residues positioned at 115.7° to the axis of a2, while in POTRA2 this helix is twice the length and positioned at an angle of 128.1° (Fig. 3B) with important functional implications because of its proximity to the exposed edge of the sheet (see below).

were apparent. The optimal NMR sample solution was selected as 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 6.5 with 50 mM NaCl by consideration of protein stability, physiological relevance and distance from the predicted pI of 5.72 (Fig. 2B and Table 2). We also screened an in-house library of 300 small biological molecules including amino acids, cofactors, metabolites, nucleotides, signalling molecules and sugars, and found no thermal shift of significance (i.e. > 2°C). Together, these suggest that the POTRA domain's novel fold is particularly stable and resilient to environmental factors. Solution structure of POTRA1-2 reveals dynamic domain orientations The solution structure of the tandem POTRA1-2 domains of YaeT was determined by NMR spectroscopy in order to provide information about the linker orientations and domain interactions in solution. In total, 2709 NOEs, 68 hydrogen bonds and 236 dihedral-angle restraints were used to calculate an ensemble of 300 structures (Table 3). Superposition of the 20 lowest-energy structures resulted in a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.50 Å for the backbone of POTRA1 (residues 23­90) and 0.52 Å for the backbone of POTRA2 (residues 93­170). The structure consists of a pair of unique baabb POTRA modules, each comprising a three-stranded b sheet overlaid with a pair of anti-parallel a helices (Fig. 3). The POTRA1 and POTRA2 structures are similar to each other and to those of the recently published ligand-free crystal structures of the N-terminal of YaeT (Kim et al., 2007), with pair-wise back-

significantly from those in the crystallized state. The highly conserved five-domain architecture and linkers within the Omp85 family suggest that the orientation of POTRA domains is integral to their function, and may be

critical for the concerted process of folding multiplystranded substrates. Distinct domain­domain architectures were presented for crystal structures of YaeT's POTRA1-4 and FhaC tandem POTRA domains (Clantin et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2007) which contrast significantly from the solution data. In the YaeT crystal structure, the POTRA1-2 juxtaposition was characterized by hydrogen bonds between Gln35-Asn161, Glu90-Ser124, Lys89Ser124 and Arg91-Asp126. Analysis of NOE and H/D exchange patterns yielded no evidence for the above hydrogen bonds in solution, despite their clearly defined resonances. Instead, weak but well-resolved interdomain NOEs were observed between the side-chains of Lys89-Asp126, Lys89-Arg127 and Glu73-Ser124, defining a unique range of low-energy solution orientations that satisfy all these restraints. Although derived in part from a lack of observable NOE restraints, this apparent mobility is underscored by the dynamics of linker residues including Arg91, which exhibits intermediate exchange behaviour indicative of multiple conformations, supporting the unique range of solution orientations observed. The juxtaposition of the domains in solution is restricted by steric hindrances, linker backbone angles and NOEs to an inter-domain rotation angle of between -78.2° and 98.1° in relation to the mean (DynDom; Hayward and Berendsen, 1998) (Fig. 3C and D), as opposed to a corresponding angle in the YaeT crystals of -85.8°. The discrepancy between the crystalline state and solution ensemble is further underscored by the apparent dynamics of the proximal loop between b1 and a1, which is loosely structured as a result of a paucity of long-range NOE restraints, despite its sharp and assigned NMR peaks.

Solution structure of POTRA1-5 To determine the solution orientation of the critical fifth POTRA domain and to investigate what effect crystal dimerization had on the structure of the YaeT fragment (Kim et al., 2007), the structure of the 46 kDa POTRA1-5 protein was investigated by SAXS. Using the same sample conditions as in the NMR experiments, 3.7 and 7.4 mg ml-1 solutions of POTRA1-5 were analysed and shown to be monomeric with a well-defined scatter. The molecule's radius of gyration (Rg) could be estimated using the Guinier approximation (Guinier, 1939). A monodispersed and globular state of POTRA1-5 was indicated by the linearity in the Guinier plot over a q range of 0.01­0.03 Å-1 (where q = 4psinq/l and 2q is the scattering angle and l is the wavelength of the X-ray), while the slope of the linear fit provides an Rg estimate of 36.4 0.3 Å, in good agreement with p(r) analysis calculated using autoGNOM (Svergun et al., 1988), where particles with a Dmax of 110.5 Å and an Rg of 36.51 0.151 were estimated (Fig. S2). Ab initio reconstruction of the solvated molecular envelope from the scattering data was performed using the DAMMIN program (Svergun, 1999), which calculates scattering intensities from a multiphase model built up from a finite number of dummy beads representing components of the protein molecule. The search for the structure began using a random configuration of beads; in subsequent steps, models better approximating the molecular shape were created and minimization was performed by simulated annealing. The positions of all five POTRA domains could be distinguished from the molecular envelope, and suggests that in solution, the protein adopts a subset of unique confor-

mations (Fig. 4). Mapping of the solved POTRA domain structures to the envelope was initially performed manually with the structure of POTRA4 used as a homology model for POTRA5, then optimized using the MASSHA program (Konarev et al., 2001). Using the CRYSOL program (Svergun et al., 1995), a fit of the optimized domain orientation to the experimentally measured SAXS data was achieved and yielded a c-value of 1.90 (Fig. 4B). The correct positioning of the domains was achieved following the mapping of the individual POTRA1 and POTRA2 NMR structures to non-overlapping, juxtaposed positions in the molecular envelope (Fig. 4C), allowing the remaining domains to be fit. The alternate orientation, with POTRAs 1­5 reversed, yielded a c-value of 2.97 and hence was deemed unlikely. Interestingly, the crystal structure of the first four POTRA domains could not be fit into the envelope created from the SAXS data (Fig. 5), suggesting a significant influence of crystallization on the domain orientations and global structure. The domain orientation observed using SAXS provides information about the average conformation of YaeT's N-terminus in solution. Clear envelopes for POTRA1, POTRA2 and POTRA5 can be distinguished. Those for POTRA3 and POTRA4 overlap, with a unique juxtaposition and apparent inter-domain bend. Broader envelopes were observed for both the POTRA1 and POTRA5 domains, with POTRA5 appearing less intimately connected and in an orientation that is sharply folded back adjacent to POTRA4. The broader envelope for POTRA1 is consistent with the apparent flexibility in the NMR structure (Fig. 4C), with the predicted envelope for the POTRA1-2 ensemble closely matching the solution envelope. We infer therefore that the broader envelope calculated for POTRA5 is also

the result of similar mobility, while the more compact envelopes of the intervening POTRA modules 2­4 suggest their more rigid positioning. Polypeptide transport-associated domains bind nascent b strands of OMPs Previous investigations suggested that the POTRA domains of Omp85-like proteins were responsible for binding of nascent OMPs prior to their folding into b-barrel structures and insertion into the outer membrane. To investigate how the POTRA domains engage OMP substrates, titrations were performed with five peptides derived from one of YaeT's folding substrates, PhoE, which is folded into a 16-stranded b-barrel porin within the outer membrane. This protein was chosen as previous studies had shown its C-terminal to interact directly with YaeT and cause pore formation (Robert et al., 2006). The peptides were selected to represent unique structural elements within the PhoE protein, including the N-terminal extended hairpin as well as the C-terminal peptide. The PhoE peptide interactions were monitored by 1 H-15N-resolved NMR experiments (Figs 6 and 7). Four peptides interacted significantly, although weakly, with

fast exchange rates on the NMR time scale, while the fifth, C-terminal peptide was insufficiently soluble at the concentrations required to complete the titration even following modification to increase solubility. Trials with an alternate C-terminal peptide derived from the E. coli autotransporter Pet, containing a similar C-terminal signal sequence to PhoE (Robert et al., 2006) as well as a fusion protein constructed from maltose-binding protein and the full-length Pet b barrel, resulted in similar aggregation and insolubility. Because of the weak affinity and fast exchange rates of binding, a large excess of peptide was required to ensure binding site saturation. All nascent b-strand and b-hairpin peptides induced a similar overall profile of chemical shift perturbations, with the largest changes involving Ile29-Phe31 and Val151-Ala153 sequences positioned along the POTRA1:b1 and POTRA2:b2 strands respectively (Figs 6 and 7). In contrast, control studies using an a-helical peptide derived from the periplasmic maltose binding protein, MalE (residues 357­370), a protein known to follow the same Sec-dependent pathway as OMPs, but then released into the periplasm, showed no binding under similar conditions (Fig. 6), suggesting that the POTRA domains are selective for extended sequences.

including those of His30 and Lys152, are ideally positioned in the solution structure to directly contact a folding substrate (Fig. 7C). As a result of the rotated juxtaposition of the domains in solution, both binding sites form a single platform that could accommodate a continuous substrate peptide which anneals to or slides along the two strands. Conformational changes could be expected to accompany binding of substrate peptides that are long enough to extend across both POTRA domains of the tandem. Significant perturbations were noted in Thr93 and Ser123 on binding the PhoE:b4 substrate peptide, which represents the longest continuous substrate strand. Thr93 is posi-

tioned in the linker region between domains, while Ser123 is present at the interface between domains and is proximal to both Thr93 and Ser124, for which NOEs to POTRA1 were observed. Other resonances outside the binding pocket also showed perturbations. Small but significant shifts were noted in resonances of b3, and may result from altered packing following substrate interaction with His30 and Lys152 within the POTRA1:b1 and POTRA2:b2 strands, while resonances close to the C-terminus and loop a2b2 residues are presumably perturbed because of their flexibility and proximity to the extremities of the extended ligand.

Discussion
The NMR structure of POTRA1-2 together with SAXS analysis of POTRA1-5 provides a unique and complete model of the solution orientation of YaeT's entire periplasmic region for the first time. Previous studies have suggested that membrane-embedded YaeT may form multimers (Robert et al., 2006) while the N-terminal region yielded dimers, as evidenced by the crystal structure (Kim et al., 2007). Size exclusion chromatography and AUC, together with NMR of POTRA1-2 and SAXS analysis of POTRA1-5, showed no evidence for any multimerization, indicating that the N-terminal region is monomeric and confirming that the dimer seen in the crystal structure is non-physiological, as previously suggested (Kim et al., 2007). This presents a paradox: a structure that does not self-associate yet presents multiple accessible sites capable of non-sequence-specific binding. We suggest that the weak affinity of individual POTRA domains for

short extended sequences and their unique multi-domain architecture precludes self-association of the exposed binding sites and strands. Further influences on multimerization could include YaeT's C-terminal b barrel and accessory factors, as well as interactions with folding substrates. Comparison of the solution and crystal structures reveals significant differences that are clearly relevant to the mechanism of action (Figs 3­5). Although the NMR structure of POTRA1-2 describes the same basic POTRA fold as observed in the crystal, quite distinct inter-domain interactions are evident. These interactions allow limited articulation between the domains and result in a unique set of orientations diverse from those in the crystal. This articulation is supported by the intermediate exchange effects observed in the linker region. Presumably, the domain orientation observed in the crystal structure is a higher-energy state in solution and hence is not represented in the 20 lowest-energy structures described. It is likely that dimer formation stabilizes this conformation, or hinders the lower-energy states observed in solution, allowing it to be observed. Ab initio modelling of SAXS

data for POTRA1-5 confirms the NMR solution structure for POTRA1-2 (Fig. 4C). The broad scattering envelope for POTRA1 is consistent with its distribution of orientations observed by NMR relative to the POTRA2 domain, which exhibits a more compact position in the SAXS envelope of all five modules. In contrast to the Z-shaped architecture of five POTRA domains seen in solution, the crystal structure of POTRA1-4 showed POTRA3 and POTRA4 to be twisted, giving a J-shaped `fishhook-like orientation'. The SAXS model reveals that POTRA3 is extended in line with POTRA1 and POTRA2, while POTRA4 and POTRA5 are angled to form a W-like arrangement. The distinct orientation seen in the crystal is dictated by a dimer contact formed by POTRA3 annealing to a C-terminal strand derived from the POTRA5 sequence (Kim et al., 2007). In solution, this interaction is not possible because of the presence of a complete fifth domain, and is further excluded by the monomeric state of the protein. The ability of the POTRA domains to adopt alternative orientations in the crystal and solution environments is supported by the conformational freedom observed between adjacent POTRA domains in the NMR structure. The structure and orientation of the critical fifth POTRA domain have remained an enigma because of difficulties in obtaining crystals (Kim et al., 2007). However, using the technique of SAXS, the orientation of this domain has been revealed. Unlike the other domains, POTRA5 appears relatively isolated and in an orientation that is sharply folded back towards POTRA4. Like POTRA1, it exhibits a broad molecular envelope, suggesting that it too is joined by a flexible linker and afforded a significant degree of conformational freedom. While the limited resolution of SAXS precludes detailed characterization of the POTRA5 structure, the domain's shape and sequence are consistent with a homologous baabb fold which is primarily distinguished by having a sharp inter-domain angle. The binding studies presented herein show that POTRA domains are able to interact with peptides mimicking nascent unfolded OMPs, and support the proposal that POTRA domains are involved in binding nascent folding substrates in vivo (Clantin et al., 2007). Binding occurs with the exposed edges of juxtaposed POTRA sheets, with the b-strand propensity of the unfolded OMPs promoting the interaction. This binding mechanism is proposed to involve cooperative networks of hydrogen bonds between the backbone of the nascent OMP and POTRA1:b1 and POTRA2:b2, as well as side-chain contacts with proximal side-chains of b1:His30 in POTRA1 and a2:Glu138 and b2:Lys152 in POTRA2. The former contacts show the most significant chemical shift perturbations while also being the most highly conserved (Fig. S3). It has been suggested that this conservation is for purely structural reasons. Here we propose a func-

tional imperative for these conserved POTRA residues where their b-branched side-chains enforce the substrate's extended conformation during the binding events, and the short annealing length of the exposed strands and lack of polar, charged or hydrogen-bonding groups promote the non-specific pairing of nascent strands. As the latter exposed residues of His30, Glu138 and Lys152 are poorly conserved across the Omp85 family, the ligand specificities of the members are likely to be broad or divergent. Nonetheless, mutations in these side-chains would directly influence nascent OMP interactions, while the pairing activity of the binding strands would be sensitive to inclusion of Pro or Gly residues, as found in some POTRA2:b2 strands (Fig. S3). The binding mode presented here is consistent with the available mutagenesis data. Insertional mutagenesis of FhaC POTRA domains in the POTRA1:b1-a2 and POTRA1:b2-b3 loops and POTRA2:a1 helix did not compromise FhaC function (Robert et al., 2006), and none of these insertions occur within the substrate binding sites predicted here. Alanine substitution in FhaC's POTRA1:a2 compromised function (Clantin et al., 2007), consistent with the predicted binding of substrate in the POTRA1:b2/a2 pocket of FhaC. Conversely, mutation of FhaC POTRA2:a2 and POTRA2:b2 did not affect function (Clantin et al., 2007), consistent with the alternate face of FhaC POTRA2 binding the substrate. It is likely therefore that FhaC POTRA domains function similarly to YaeT POTRA domains. Binding of OMPs by pairing with exposed POTRA sheets is an ideal mechanism for handling a variety of unfolded b-barrel proteins, as it is relatively insensitive to the diversity of their side-chains while being selective for the alternating hydrophobic:polar periodicities and extended predispositions of their b-barrel elements. This binding mode suggests a novel mechanism for POTRA function. We propose that the multiple POTRA domains of Omp85 homologues bind unfolded OMPs at one of two possible sites on either side of their b sheets, and act to thread the OMP into the YaeT core complex through limited articulation about their unique hinges. This is consistent with the weak binding observed for the tandem POTRA domains, thus facilitating substrate sliding. The presence of five POTRA domains could provide the necessary avidity to recruit and process nascent OMPs, with the flexibility between tandem modules helping their strands to ratchet into position. How the accessory factors function in this process remains unclear. We can speculate that YfiO, the only critical accessory factor in the YaeT complex and one that interacts directly with YaeT, is likely to be involved in aiding YaeT's POTRA domains in folding/ insertion (Malinverni et al., 2006). The other less critical accessory factors, such as YfgL, whose absence interferes with folding/insertion of selected OMPs only

(Charlson et al., 2006), are more likely to have roles in the recruitment of nascent OMPs from the periplasm by acting as docking sites for chaperones. We envision that this binding could correctly position and free the nascent OMP to allow binding to YaeT's POTRA domains.

Experimental procedures
Cloning and protein purification
Constructs of YaeT spanning amino acid residues 1­174 (containing POTRA domains 1 and 2) and 1­424 (containing POTRA domains 1­5) were cloned into the pQE70 expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli M15pREP4 strain (Qiagen) to produce C-terminal His Tagged fusion proteins lacking the N-terminal signal peptide (POTRA1-2 and POTRA1-5). Unlabelled POTRA1-2 and POTRA1-5 were purified from cells induced at 37°C for 4 h in Luria­Bertani broth. Uniformly 15N and 13C/15N-labelled POTRA1-2 was produced in M9 minimal media supplemented with 15NH4Cl and 13C6glucose (Spectra Gases) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources using induction at 30°C for 10 h. Both proteins were purified using nickel affinity, Q sepharose ion exchange and Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare). Their monomeric states were determined by size exclusion chromatography and AUC.

with triple resonance probes with z-axis pulse field gradients. A cryogenic probe was used for the experiments with the Inova 800 and 900 MHz spectrometers. POTRA1-2 sample concentration was typically 0.2­0.8 mM in 50 mM MES buffer pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaN3 and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche) in 90% H2O/10% D2O. Spin system and sequential assignments were made from 1H, 15N-HSQC, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCO, H(C)CH TOCSY (H)CCH TOCSY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (tmix = 100 ms) and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments (tmix = 100 ms) (Grzesiek et al., 1993; Kay et al., 1993; Muhandiram and Kay, 1994) as previously described (Knowles et al., 2007). Asn and Gln side-chain 1H and 15N resonances were assigned using 3D 15N-edited NOESYHSQC and 3D CBCA(CO)NH spectra. Spectra were processed with NMRPipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) and analysed using SPARKY (Goddard and Kneller).

Structure calculation
Proton distance constraints for the structure calculation were obtained through the analysis of three-dimensional 15N-edited (tmix = 100 ms) and 13C-edited (tmix = 100 ms) NOESY-HSQC spectra. The cross peaks were manually picked and the peak volumes estimated using SPARKY (Goddard and Kneller). Backbone dihedral-angle restraints (j and y) were obtained using the TALOS method (Cornilescu et al., 1999). The 3D structure was determined using the CANDID/CYANA package with the automated NOE cross-peak assignment and structure calculation with torsion-angle dynamics implemented (Güntert, 2004). The CYANA protocol consisted of seven iterative cycles of NOE assignment and structure calculation. The first cycle starts from 100 random conformers with 10 000 torsion-angle dynamic steps performed per conformer in each cycle with the results being used as input in the following cycle. The seven cycles were followed by a final structure calculation where the 20 conformers with the lowest CYANA target function were chosen as representative. Aria1.2 was used to perform the final water minimization (Linge et al., 2001). A total of 2709 NOEs, 68 hydrogen bonds and 236 dihedral-angle restraints were used in the final calculation. Structures were analysed using PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al., 1993). Table 3 shows the structural statistics. RMSD values from the average structure were calculated using the MOLMOL program (Koradi et al., 1996). Angles between secondary structure elements were calculated using interhlx, K. Yap, University of Toronto. The structural co-ordinates for POTRA1-2 have been deposited in the Protein Database under Accession Code 2v9h.

Analytical ultracentrifugation
Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were performed at 4°C using 0.2 mM protein in 50 mM MES pH 6.5 + 50 mM NaCl with a ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman). All experiments were sedimentation velocity and recorded using both absorbance and interference optics, 400 scans at 40000 r.p.m. and 280 nm. Data were processed using SEDFIT (Schuck, 2000).

Thermal shift assay
Solutions of 2 ml containing 20 mM protein with 100¥ SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) were added to 18 ml of 1.11¥ test compound (buffer or additive) to the wells of a 96-well ThermoFast PCR-plate (Abgene). Water was added instead of test compound in the control samples. The plates were sealed with highly transparent polypropylene film (Brand GMBH) and heated in an MxPro3005P qPCR detection system (Stratagene) from 25°C to 95°C in increments of 1°C. Fluorescence changes in the wells of the plate were measured three times min-1 at three different gain settings. The wavelengths for excitation and emission were 492 and 568 nm respectively. To obtain the temperature midpoint for the protein unfolding transition, Tm, the first derivative was taken and used to determine the point of inflection of the melting curve. All data were processed using MxPro software (Stratagene).

Peptide binding studies
Peptide binding studies were performed using a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and z-axis pulse field gradients. The 1H,15N-HSQC titrations were performed using 50 mM POTRA1-2 in the presence of the various PhoE and control peptide sequences (PhoEb16b1 ­ AEIYNKDGNKLDVYG, PhoEb1b2 ­ HYMSD NASKDGDQSY, PhoEb4 ­ AQQKTRLAFAGLKYKD, PhoEint ­ RNKGAKYDVEAWTDM, PhoECterm ­ INNDDIVAVGM

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed at 303 K on Varian Inova 600, 800 or 900 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped

TYQF and MalE:Control ­ VDEALKDAQTRITK). Peptide concentrations for titrations were 0.00, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25 and 1.50 mM.

Small-angle X-ray scattering
X-ray scattering experiments were performed at the I22 ­ non-crystalline diffraction beamline at Diamond Light Source, UK, with a wavelength of 1.46 Å. Measurements were performed on POTRA1-5 at a concentrations of 7.4 and 3.7 mg ml-1 in 50 mM MES pH 6.5 and 50 mM NaCl and at a temperature of 25°C. Scattering was recorded using a High Overall Throughout SAXS Gas detector. The detector was set at a distance of 5 m from the sample position. Data for which q is between 0.044 and 0.240 Å were used for the analyses, where q is the scattering vector defined as:

q = 4 sin 

(1)

where 2q is the scattering angle and l is the wavelength of the X-ray. The data were averaged after normalization to the intensity of the incident beam, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted and the final scattering curve was obtained by merging the scattering data collected at lower concentration with the data recorded at a higher concentration. All data manipulations were performed using the Dream (Diamond) and Primus (Konarev et al., 2003) packages. The Rg and forward scattering I(O) were computed in Primus using the Guinier approximation (Guinier, 1939):
2 I (s ) = I (O) exp ( -s 2 Rg 3)
