A series of carboxylic acids were prepared from a propargylglycine scaffold and tested for efficacy as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors. Detailed SAR for the series is reported for four enzymes within the MMP family. The inhibitors were typically potent against collagenase-3 (MMP-13) and gelatinase A (MMP-2), while they spared collagenase-1 (MMP-1) and only moderately inhibited stromelysin (MMP-3). Compound 40 represents a typical inhibition profile of a compound with reasonable potency. Introduction of polar groups was required in order to generate inhibitors with acceptable water solubility, and this often resulted in a loss of potency as in compound 63. High serum protein binding proved to be a difficult hurdle with many compounds such as 48 showing >99% binding. Some compounds such as 64 displayed 90% binding, but no reliable method was discovered for designing molecules with low protein binding. Finally, selected data regarding the pharmacokinetic behavior of these compounds is presented.
Introduction The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are enzymes which are responsible for connective tissue remodeling and have emerged as intriguing targets for a startlingly wide array of disease processes where aberrant tissue remodeling plays a key role.1 These indications include: osteoarthritis,2,3 rheumatoid arthritis,4-6 tumor metastasis,7-9 multiple sclerosis,10-12 congestive heart failure,13-15 and a host of others. A number of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) have progressed into clinical trials for cancer, rheumatiod arthritis, and osteoarthritis. The vast majority of them have been hydroxamic acids such as marimastat (1) which is a broad-spectrum inhibitor and was the first MMPI to enter clinical trials for cancer treatment. So far, progression of broad-spectrum MMPIs through these trials has been hampered due to a prevalent side effect known as musculoskeletal syndrome (MSS) which manifests itself as musculoskeletal pain and inflamation. Accordingly, current focus in the field is directed toward the development of selective inhibitors which target only those enzymes which play a role in a given disease state. BAY-129566 (2) is a highly selective inhibitor for gelatinase A which showed no signs of MSS in phase 2 clinical trials; however, it was withdrawn from clinical trials. Other groups have also described development of selective, carboxylic acidbased inhibitors including those at Warner-Lambert16 (3) and Shionogi17,18 (4), but so far, no clinical data has been reported. Our group has been actively developing hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors since the mid-1990s19-23 and have recently turned our attention to exploring the development of carboxylic acid-based inhibitors.

a desire for selective inhibitors that would target inhibition of MMP-13 while sparing MMP-1 and MMP7. We chose to begin our investigations with sulfonamide derivatives of unnatural amino acids, and the effort ultimately led us to a functionalized propargylglycine scaffold. We believed that this would allow a diverse set of functionality to be placed on the terminus of the alkyne to access the S2 binding pocket of the MMP enzymes and/or allow for modification of the physical properties of the resulting inhibitors. Chemistry Propargylglycine 5 (Scheme 1) served as a convenient starting material for many of the compounds described here as it is commercially available as a racemate as well as in either enantiomeric form. Williams esterification and Boc protection then provided a molecule

which undergoes an efficient palladium- and coppermediated coupling with iodobenzene to give 6 in good yield.24 This coupling method extended well to substituted iodobenzenes but failed with iodo heterocycles despite literature which indicates that various heterocycles couple nicely to alkynes under these conditions.25 Variously substituted biphenylsulfonamides could then be accessed by removing the Boc protecting group and coupling the resulting free amine with a 4-halobenzenesulfonyl chloride under standard conditions. 4-Iodobenzenesulfonyl chloride was used in this case to give 7. Suzuki coupling26 with the resulting sulfonamide 7 and a boronic acid of choice then provided biphenylsulfonamides of type 8 which can be saponified to provide the desired inhibitor 30. One can alternatively prepare the desired, optionally substituted methoxybiphenylsulfonyl chloride27 and then couple it directly to the methyl ester of propargylglycine to give terminal alkyne 9. A copper-mediated

Mannich reaction25,28 then allowed coupling to various secondary amines such as morpholine and protected piperadines to give propargylamines of type 10 and 11. The piperadine moiety in 11 could then be deprotected and functionalized to expand the variety of available analogues. The commercially available epoxide 13 in Scheme 2 provided a second convenient entry to substituted propargylglycines. It can be obtained in either enantiomeric configuration; however, for the purposes of this study, racemic material was used. A Lewis acid-mediated ring opening with an alkyne anion of choice provided chiral alcohols of type 14. The relative mesylate of 14 was prepared but proved to be inert to azide displacement due to the deactivating effect of the -tertbutoxy group. The tert-butyl group was therefore removed under acidic conditions, and the resulting -hydroxy mesylate underwent slow but quantitative displacement upon treatment with sodium azide to give azide

in analogy with Scheme 1. The free amino alcohol moiety was revealed upon exposure of 18 to acidic Amberlyst 15 resin followed by 4 N HCl to remove the Boc protecting group. The free amine was then trapped with 4-iodobenzenesulfonyl chloride under SchottenBaumann conditions to deliver the sulfonamide 19. Finally, the primary alcohol in 19 was oxidized to an acid with Jones reagent and trapped as its methyl ester. Suzuki coupling with 4-methoxybenzeneboronic acid then gave desired oxygen containing scaffold 20. The sulfonamidoaniline moieties can be accessed and functionalized via acetamides of type 21. This in turn can be accessed from any scaffold of interest which bears a free nitrogen by coupling with a sulfonyl chloride of choice; alternatively, azides of type 15 can be decomposed and trapped as described for compound 16. This provides an alternative to methods which have been previously described for related compounds.29,30 Jones oxidation of the free alcohol then provides its carboxylic acid analogue, and subsequent treatment with concentrated sulfuric acid in methanol esterifies the acid and deprotects the anilinic nitrogen to provide 22 as an HCl salt. This then serves as a pivotal intermediate which can be functionalized with any number of acyl equivalents including p-anisoyl chloride which was used to provide 23. Saponification of the ester then gave inhibitor 50. SAR and Biological Results All compounds were tested for the inhibition of various MMP enzymes, including collagenases-1, -2, and -3 (MMP-1, -8, and -13, respectively), gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and -9, respectively), stromelysin (MMP-3), and matrilysin (MMP-7). The data for MMP-7, -8, and -9 are omitted here for clarity, but their inhibition profiles tended to mimic MMP-1 and -2, respectively, while MMP-9 was typically 1 order of magnitude less potent than MMP-2. All binding data for the carboxylic acid-based inhibitors in this manuscript were obtained and reported at pH ) 7.4. While it has been reported that a dramatic potency increase is observed when data is obtained at a slightly more acidic pH (6.0-6.5),16 we felt that data obtained at physiological pH was more relevant to the natural disease situation in vivo. The SARs of the substituted propargylglycines seemed to be highly variable and depend very heavily on the substitution pattern of the aromatic sulfonamide group as well as the appendage which was attached to the terminus of the alkyne substituent. Water solubility and serum protein binding data for selected compounds were also obtained and are reported in Table 4. SAR of Phenylpropargylglycine Derivatives. Much of the early SAR work was done with inhibitors that contain a phenylpropargylglycine scaffold, and these are listed in Tables 1 and 2. These inhibitors typically demonstrated reasonable potency for MMP-2 and -13 in those cases where the P1 substituent was a substituted biphenylsulfonamide moiety such as with 27. Potency was rarely observed for MMP-1, while MMP-3 tended to receive moderate inhibiton. A notable exception to this was observed with the insertion of an alkyne into the biphenyl system as in 40 which retained a similar inhibition profile to compound 27. Replacement of the alkyne with the azido group in 41 resulted

15. The most convenient method of proceeding proved to be decomposition of the azide with triphenylphosphine. The resulting amine is then extracted from organic media with dilute acid, neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, and treated with methoxybiphenylsulfonyl chloride under Shotten-Baumann conditions to give the desired sulfonamide 16. The primary alcohol was then oxidized to provide the desired inhibitor 48. The commercially available aldehyde 17 provided an asymmetric and diastereoselective entry into propargylglycines that contained a -alkoxy group as seen in Scheme 3. This was set up initially with an alkynyllithium addition to 17 which occurred diastereospecifically. Subsequent methylation under basic conditions then gave 18 in high combined yield for the two steps. The remaining transformations were then carried out

in the loss of 1 order of magnitude in potency. In most cases, a thiomethyl group in the 4-position of the biphenyl moiety seemed to be the optimum substituent

for potency although a methoxy group was also attractive (compare compounds 27 vs 30). Arylamides of type 42 were typically exclusively selective for MMP-2.

High serum protein binding (see Table 4) proved to be a significant hurdle which needed to be addressed. Data with highly lipophilic compounds such as 27 and 40 indicated that these compounds were highly proteinbound in the blood and thus unavailable as free inhibitors. We hoped to establish a link between lipophilicity and water solubility, so we sought to incorporate more hydrophilic groups into the phenylpropargylglycine scaffold as seen with compounds 32, 28, and 34. Indeed, increased water solubility was observed, but this was not accompanied by a concomitant lowering of protein binding. We thus chose to remove the phenyl ring from the primary scaffold and replaced it with groups containing a greater array of heteroatom diversity. SAR of Substituted Butynylglycine Derivatives. Replacement of the phenyl ring with a substituted methylene allowed for a far greater diversity of functionality, as seen in Table 3. Initial probing with compound 47 indicated that this methylene homologue of 27 resulted in negligible change in potency. Unfortunately, replacement of the phenyl ring with hydrophilic groups such as methoxy (48), phenoxy (55), morpholino (61), and substituted piperidines (65-67) all resulted in significant losses in potency. We hoped to overcome this through modification of the P1 group, and indeed, a 4-fold increase in potency was observed upon replacement of the methoxy group with the thiomethoxy group in 62 and by extending the biphenyl with the acetylene in 63. As before, replacement of the biphenyl moiety with aromatic amides as in 50 and 64 resulted in highly MMP-2-selective compounds. As we had hoped, most of the compounds in Table 3 were more water-soluble than the phenyl-containing analogues as exemplified by compounds 48, 50, 63, and 64, all of which showed water solubility in excess of 5 mg/mL. Except for 48, a notable decrease in protein binding for all of these compounds was also observed. Inconsistent trends such as 48 vs 49 vs 50 however do

not allow us to ascribe a direct correlation between water solubility and protein binding. We ultimately observed that most compounds below 1 mg/mL are highly protein-bound and should be avoided, but no reliable, rational method was discovered for the design of compounds with low protein binding. Structure of Inhibitor-Stromelysin Complex of Compound 48.31 A crystal structure of stromelysin was obtained with compound 48 bound in the active site according to a previously described procedure,32 and the data is represented graphically in Figures 1 and 2. The structure was obtained by soaking the inhibitor into a previously prepared crystal at pH ) 6.5. The data clearly shows that the biphenyl moiety fits into the P1 pocket of the enzyme. This is consistent with structural data which has been reported previously with carboxylic acid scaffolds containing similar sulfonamide moieties using both X-ray crystal data33 and homology modeling.16 Additionally, key hydrogen bonds exist between the internal sulfonamide oxygen and both Ala 165 (3.4 Å) and Leu 164 (2.7 Å) which seems to be a key interaction with sulfonamide types of MMP inhibitors.22 The carboxylic acid binds to the active site zinc ion in what appears to be a bidentate fashion with bonding distances of 1.9 and 2.9 Å. The close proximity of Glu 202 to the ligand carboxylic acid imparts significant anion/anion repulsion when they are both in their ionic forms. This becomes a hydrogen-bonding interaction as the acids are protonated at lower pH as displayed in this structure where the two acids are in hydrogenbonding distances of 2.5 and 3.2 Å from one another. This explains the dramatic pH dependence displayed by MMP-3 on the potency of carboxylic acid inhibitors. The alkynyl side chain seems to rest comfortably in the lipophyllic S2 cleft, and there is significant density data to support its preference for this orientation. In Vivo Pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics of selected representatives from this series of compounds

absorption may contribute to the lower BA, and this is supported by the correlation we see between BA and molecular weight. The two compounds that have molecular weights over 500, 28 and 63, have significantly lower BA values than their smaller counterparts, 27 and 40. We are continuing to investigate the factors which are contributing to both the low BA and short half-life of these compounds. Conclusion We have described a new series of carboxylic acidbased MMP inhibitors which are derived from a propargylglycine scaffold. The more potent of these compounds are highly selective for MMP-2 and -13 and demonstrate low-nanomolar activity. The more lipophilic compounds tend to be highly bound by serum albumen. The more hydrophilic compounds tend to be less potent; however, some examples exhibit somewhat less protein binding. Limited pharmacokinetic data shows a high variability between compounds. Experimental Section
General. All commercial chemicals and solvents are reagent grade and were used without further purification unless otherwise specified. The following solvents and reagents have been abbreviated: tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl ether (Et2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane (DCM), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol (MeOH). All reactions except those in aqueous media were carried out with the use of standard techniques for the exclusion of moisture. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on 0.25-mm silica gel plates (60F-254, E. Merck) and visualized with UV light, iodine vapors, or 5% phosphomolybdic acid in 95% ethanol. Final compounds were typically purified either by flash chromatography on silica gel (E. Merck, 40-63 mm) or by preparative reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) using a Waters model 4000 Delta Prep instrument equipped with a Waters Symmetry preparative steel column (C-18, 19 m × 300 mm) as the stationary phase. The mobile phase employed 0.1% formic acid with acetonitrile as the organic modifier. Both isocratic and linear gradient methods were used as appropriate and the flow rate was 20 mL/min. Analytical purity was assessed by RP-HPLC using a Waters 600 system equipped with a diode array spectrometer (range 200-400 nm). The stationary phase was a Waters Symmetry C-18 column (4.6 mm × 200 mm). The mobile phase employed 0.1% formic acid with acetonitrile as the organic modifier and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Analytical data is reported as retention time, tR, in minutes (% acetonitrile, time, flow rate). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity-300 instrument. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm,  units). Coupling constants are reported in units of hertz (Hz). Splitting patterns are designated as s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; br, broad. Lowresolution mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a Micromass Platform quadrupole mass spectrometer. Mass spectra were acquired in either the positive or negative ion mode under electrospray ionization (ESI). Combustion analyses were performed internally. Human synovial proMMP-3 was obtained from Dr. Hideaki Nagase, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS. Human fibroblast proMMP-1, human MMP-9, and human

The studies were conducted in fasted rats (n ) 3/4) using 4-5 compounds per experiment at a dose of 1-5 mg/kg of each inhibitor. Each animal study included a control compound that had been previously characterized in a single-compound experiment which served to validate each data set and illuminate problems such as saturation of elimination. The data suggest that most of the compounds have a somewhat short half-life with low to moderate bioavailability (BA). We assume that poor

Anal. (C28H28N2O6S,0.5H2O) C, H, N. MMP Inhibition Assay. The preparation of the human recombinant MMPs used in these studies has been described previously.19 MMP inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit human MMPs using the quenched fluorescence assay.37 This assay was modified to fit a 96-well format to increase the throughput. Assays for MMP-1, -3, -8 and -13 employed human recombinant truncated enzymes. MMP-7 was assayed using recombinant catalytic domain. The optimal amount of each enzyme to produce significant and reproducible substrate cleavage was determined in preliminary experiments. Assays for MMP-2 and -9 utilized human recombinant full-length enzymes. MMP-2 was activated by incubating proMMP-2 with

Natchus et al. APMA (1 mM) for 45 min. The final concentration of MMP-2 in the assay mixture was 1 nM. ProMMP-9 was activated with MMP-3 (ratio 20:1) for 2 h and diluted to a final assay concentration of 0.75 nM. The final concentration of MMP-3 in the assay was 0.038 nM. The low concentration of MMP-3 in the final MMP-9 dilution did not contribute to the rate of substrate cleavage as assessed by control experiments with 0.038 nM MMP-3. MMP-1, -3, -7, -8, and -13 were used at final concentrations of 8, 16, 2, 4 and 0.5 nM, respectively. The MMP assays was performed using the fluorogenic substrate McaPro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 at a concentration of 4 µM at 25 °C. The assay buffer was 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.02% Brij-35. The increase in fluorescence due to cleavage of the substrate (Gly-Leu bond) was monitored kinetically for 30 min with a BMG Fluostar fluorescence plate reader (ex 328 nm, em 393 nm). Each 96well microtiter plate contained 100 µL of substrate and 50 µL of enzyme in each well. 50 µL of MMP inhibitor was added to each well (except for positive control) to give a final volume of 200 µL/well. MMP inhibitors were tested at 8 different concentrations and an IC50 was calculated using the formula: Vi/Vo ) 1/1 + [I]/IC50, where Vi is the initial velocity of substrate cleavage in the presence of inhibitor at concentration [I] and Vo is the initial velocity in the absence of inhibitor. BU Solubility Determination. Approximately 250 µL of pH 7 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (ionic strength 0.15 M with NaCl) was placed in a 1-mL HPLC vial. A small amount (34 mg) of compound was then added to the buffer. The solution was sonicated for about 1 min to dissolve the test compound. The solution was then set on a wrist-action shaker and shaken for 24 h at room temperature. If necessary, more compound was added to achieve a saturated solution after agitation. The saturated solution was transferred into a 1.7mL conical micro centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 8 min. An aliquot of the saturated solution was withdrawn and diluted using mobile phase (methanol:0.1% formic acid). The sample was assayed against known standards. These standards were prepared using the test compound from concentrations of 1 to 250 µg/mL dissolved in identical mobile phase.
