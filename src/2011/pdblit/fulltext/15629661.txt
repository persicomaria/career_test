Abstract GlnD is a bifunctional uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme that has a central role in the general nitrogen regulatory system NTR. In enterobacteria, GlnD uridylylates the PII proteins GlnB and GlnK under low levels of fixed nitrogen or ammonium. Under high ammonium levels, GlnD removes UMP from these proteins (deuridylylation). The PII proteins are signal transduction elements that integrate the signals of nitrogen, carbon and energy, and transduce this information to proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism. In Herbaspirillum seropedicae, an endophytic diazotroph isolated from grasses, several genes coding for proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism have been identified and cloned, including glnB, glnK and glnD. In this work, the GlnB, GlnK and GlnD proteins of H. seropedicae were overexpressed in their native forms, purified and used to reconstitute the uridylylation system in vitro. The results show that H. seropedicae GlnD uridylylates GlnB and GlnK trimers producing the forms PII (UMP)1, PII (UMP)2 and PII (UMP)3, in a reaction that requires 2-oxoglutarate and ATP, and is inhibited by glutamine. The quantification of these PII forms indicates that GlnB was more efficiently uridylylated than GlnK in the system used. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen metabolism in many gram-negative bacteria is controlled by the general nitrogen regulatory (NTR)1 system. In the enterobacteria Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, this system is composed of the PII proteins GlnB and GlnK, the two-component system proteins NtrB and NtrC and the bifunctional enzyme GlnD (uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing) [1]. GlnD senses the nitrogen status of the cell through the glutamine level and transmits this information to GlnB and GlnK by catalyzing a covalent modification of these proteins [2­9]. Under low glutamine levels, GlnD has an uridylyltransferase activity

and transfers a UMP group from UTP to GlnB or GlnK. Conversely, under higher glutamine levels, GlnD has uridylyl-removing activity and deuridylylates PII proteins. Kinetic studies of the uridylylation of E. coli GlnB suggested that GlnD has a single catalytic center capable of exerting both uridylyltransferase and uridylyl-removing activities, and indicate that GlnB and GlnB-UMP compete for this site [8]. GlnB and GlnK have similar trimeric structures and present three uridylylation sites, corresponding to the Tyr51 residue localized in the T-loop of each monomer [6,9­13]. The GlnB protein integrates the signals of nitrogen, carbon and energy, and transduces this information to other proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism [14]. The uridylylation status of GlnB signals the levels of fixed nitrogen to the receptor proteins, which include the histidine kinase

NtrB and the glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase/ adenylyl-removing enzyme GlnE [15­20]. In addition, the effectors 2-oxoglutarate and ATP bind to PII proteins which modifies the relayed signal according to the carbon and energy status of the cell [8,21­24]. The GlnK protein can also be modified by GlnD and acts to control NtrB and GlnE activities, but with lower efficiency [9]. In E. coli, the GlnK uridylylation rate is similar to that of GlnB, although GlnK-UMP deuridylylation is slower than GlnB-UMP [9]. GlnK controls the activity of AmtB, a membrane-bound ammonium transporter. In E. coli, under low ammonium levels, GlnK is uridylylated and free in the cytosol. When the ammonium concentrations rise, GlnK is deuridylylated and binds to AmtB, inhibiting ammonium transport [25,26]. PII proteins also interact with other targets to signal the nitrogen status. In K. pneumoniae, under ammonium limitation, GlnK is required to relieve NifL inhibition of the NifA protein, the transcriptional activator of nif genes [27,28]. In Azospirillum brasilense, the PII protein GlnZ complexes with AmtB, and causes the membrane binding of the DraG protein. This ternary association is part of a system that controls nitrogenase activity [29,30]. In Bacillus subtilis, the major transcription factor of nitrogen metabolism, TnrA, also is sequestered to the cytoplasmic membrane by the complex GlnK-AmtB [31]. Herbaspirillum seropedicae is an endophytic diazotroph isolated from grasses [32]. In this organism, the genes that code for the components of the NTR system were identified: ntrB and ntrC (glnAntrBC operon), glnK (orf1glnKamtB operon), glnB and glnD [33­35]. The uridylylation site Tyr51 is conserved in both the GlnB and GlnK proteins. H. seropedicae GlnB uridylylation in vitro was previously observed using partially purified E. coli GlnD or an H. seropedicae cell-free extract as the GlnD source [36]. Here we report the expression and purification of the H. seropedicae GlnD protein and the PII proteins GlnB and GlnK. H. seropedicae GlnD was completely insoluble in the conditions used to purify the E. coli GlnD. However, we optimized the induction and lysis buffer protocol resulting in a 50% solubilization of GlnD in native condition. The activity of purified GlnD was verified by reconstituting the uridylylation system in vitro using purified H. seropedicae PII proteins. Materials and methods Bacterial strains and plasmids The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work are described in Table 1. Plasmid constructions The H. seropedicae glnK and glnD genes were amplified from the purified genomic DNA of the H. seropedicae SmR1 strain. The glnK gene was cloned into the NdeI

and BamHI sites of the vector pET29a+ yielding plasmid pEMB200. The glnD gene was cloned into pGEM-T resulting in plasmid pGH1. This plasmid was digested with the NdeI and BamHI enzymes and the insert containing glnD was cloned in pET29a+ to yield pGH2. Expression and purification of GlnB and GlnK proteins The plasmids expressing H. seropedicae GlnB (pEMB101.8) [36] and GlnK (pEMB200) native proteins were introduced into E. coli strain RB9065kDE3, a double glnB/glnD mutant expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The procedures for expression and purification of these proteins were the same: cells were grown at 37 °C in a rotatory shaker (120 rpm) in LB medium with 0.2% L-glutamine and antibiotics as required. Protein expression was induced with IPTG (0.5 mM) for 3 h under the same conditions. Cells were centrifuged at 18,800g for 10 min and the pellet was dissolved in buffer A 50% (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 50% glycerol). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 1 mM) was added before and after cell lysis and the mixture was stored at À80 °C. To purify PII proteins, thawed cells were incubated with lysozyme (50 lg/mL) (SIGMA, Grade I) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then sonicated eight times for 45 s at 20% power (Ultrasonic Processor XL, Heat Systems) and diluted fivefold in buffer A (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA). Cells were centrifuged at 26,900g for 10 min and the soluble fraction was treated with 2% streptomycin sulfate for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 26,900g for 30 min, the supernatant was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare; approximately 30 mL) equilibrated in buffer A 10% (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) ¨ and connected to an Akta system (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted in 3 column volumes using a linear NaCl gradient (0.05­1 M) in buffer A 10%. Samples were analyzed by 15% SDS­PAGE [37] and fractions containing the PII proteins were concentrated with 75% saturated ammonium sul-

fate. After centrifugation at 26,900g for 30 min the pellet was dissolved in buffer A 5% (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol) and loaded on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare; 28 mL) equilibrated in buffer A 5% and connected to an ¨ Akta system. Proteins were eluted with 1 column volume of buffer A 5%. Samples were analyzed by 15% SDS­PAGE and the fractions containing the most pure proteins were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A 50%. Expression and purification of the GlnD protein The plasmid pGH2, expressing the H. seropedicae GlnD native protein was introduced into E. coli strain RB9065kDE3. Cells grown at 30 °C and 120 rpm in LB medium with 0.2% L-glutamine and required antibiotics were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 4 h under the same growth conditions. Cells were collected as before, the pellet was dissolved in buffer C 50% (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 50% glycerol) containing 1 mM PMSF and stored at À80 °C. Cell lysate was obtained by incubation with lysozyme (50 lg/mL) for 30 min on ice, followed by sonication (eight times for 45 s at 20% power). The extract was then diluted fivefold in buffer D (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT) containing 1 mM PMSF and centrifuged at 26,900g for 10 min. The soluble fraction was treated with 2% streptomycin sulfate for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 26,900g for 30 min. The supernatant fraction was loaded on a DEAE­Sepharose column (GE Healthcare; approximately 30 mL) equilibrated with buffer D 10% (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10% ¨ glycerol) and connected to an Akta system. Proteins were eluted in 3 column volumes with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1­1 M) in buffer D 10%. Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS­PAGE and GlnD-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer D 50% (50 mM Tris­ HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and 50% glycerol). This preparation was then diluted fivefold with buffer D without glycerol and loaded on an Agarose­Heparin column (GE Healthcare; 1 mL). The protein was eluted using 10 column volumes of buffer D with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1­1 M). Samples were analyzed by 10% SDS­PAGE and fractions that contained the most pure protein were pooled, dialyzed against buffer D 50% and stored at À80 °C. Protein analysis Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford [38]. E. coli extracts and purified proteins were analyzed in 10 or 15% SDS­PAGE [37]. Gels were stained with Coomassie blue 250R or silver [39]. Uridylylation reactions were analyzed in 7.5% native polyacrylamide gels as described by Goldenberg [40] and modified by Forchhammer and Tandeau De Marsac [41]. Briefly, electrophoresis was carried out in a high pH discontinuous buffer (375 mM Tris­HCl, pH 8.9) system containing 0.025% of

Nonidet P-40 in both stacking and separating gels. Electrophoresis was at 100 V for 4 h. The gels were stained with the fluorescent dye SyPro Ruby (Invitrogen), visualized using a 302 UV transilluminator and recorded by a cooled CCD camera (Biochemi, UVP). The LabWorks Image Acquisition and Analysis software (UVP) version 4.0.0.8 was used for quantitative analyses of the gel images. Uridylylation assays The uridylylation system contained ATP (200 lM), 2oxoglutarate (5 mM), UTP (1 mM), the purified proteins GlnB (2 lM) or GlnK (2 lM) and GlnD as indicated in uridylylation buffer (100 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, and 25 mM MgCl2). The reactions were initiated by adding UTP (1 mM) and stopped with 0.3 volumes of loading buffer (250 mM Tris­HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mM EDTA, 50% glycerol, and 0.02% Bromophenol blue). In each assay, the uridylylation state of PII proteins was determined by electrophoresis in native gels. To determine the effect of glutamine on the uridylylation of GlnB and GlnK proteins, the reactions were carried out as above for different times in the absence or presence of 5 mM L-glutamine. The bands were visualized on native gels and quantified to calculate the uridylylation state of the PII proteins. Results and discussion Cloning and expression of GlnB, GlnK and GlnD proteins The H. seropedicae glnK and glnD genes were amplified and cloned into pET29a+ yielding the plasmids pEMB200 and pGH2, which express the GlnK and GlnD proteins in their native forms, respectively. The H. seropedicae GlnB protein was expressed from plasmid pEMB101.8 [36], which contains the glnB gene inserted in pET28b+. The H. seropedicae proteins were over-expressed in E. coli strain RB9065kDE3, a double glnB/glnD mutant that expresses the T7 RNA polymerase [36] (Fig. 1). The mutation of glnD in this strain ensures that the PII proteins will be in the non-uridylylated form. L-Glutamine was added to the medium because the glnD mutation results in a low level of glutamine synthetase activity. Overexpressed GlnB and GlnK proteins were highly soluble in their lysis buffer (see Materials and methods). However, H. seropedicae GlnD was completely insoluble in the lysis buffer used in the purification of E. coli GlnD (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 10% glycerol) [21]. To improve solubility we tested buffer compositions with different pH and salt concentrations. The best result was achieved using Tris­HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and NaCl (buffer C: 50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT), which produced 50% GlnD solubilization. Also, GlnD protein solubility was greatly influenced by the induction temperatures. At 37 °C, the temperature used to express GlnB and GlnK proteins,

GlnD was mostly present in the insoluble fraction, whereas at 30 °C, GlnD was partially (50%) soluble (Fig. 2). To increase the GlnD solubility several protocols were tested, such as changing IPTG concentration, using lactose as inducer and addition of 0.2% Triton X-100 to the lysis buffer. However these alterations did not improve GlnD solubility. Addition of 0.4% N-lauryl-sarcosine to the lysis buffer increased by 85% the amount of GlnD protein present in the soluble fraction, however this treatment could decrease its activity. Apparently, the E. coli GlnD protein was fully soluble during purification [21], although these authors noted that a fraction of the E. coli GlnD was found in the gel column void volume, suggesting the formation of aggregates. The GlnD protein from the a-proteobacterium A. brasilense, was also only partially soluble, similar to that of H. sero´ pedicae GlnD (Araujo et al., unpublished data).

Herbaspirillum seropedicae GlnB and GlnK proteins were purified in an anionic exchange column (Q-Sepharose) followed by gel filtration (Superdex 75) (Fig. 3a). These proteins showed a similar purification pattern on both columns. In the first step, GlnB and GlnK were eluted at an NaCl concentration of approximately 400 mM. High losses of GlnB and GlnK were observed in the ion exchange chromatography step. This was to due to the rejection of fractions that contained PII proteins with too many contaminants. This step was necessary to partially purify the sample before loading onto the gel filtration column. Comparing the two proteins, the GlnK final yield was noticeably lower (twofold) than that of GlnB (Table 2), despite a similar behavior in the chromatographic steps. Since GlnK cannot be uridylylated in strain RB9065kDE3, it is possible that part of GlnK remained bound to the AmtB protein. This is consistent with the loss in the gel filtration step, where the recovery of GlnK was lower than that of GlnB, since the high molecular weight GlnK-AmtB complex would be eluted in the column void volume fraction. Anionic exchange (DEAE­Sepharose) and affinity column (agarose­heparin) were used to purify GlnD (Fig. 3b). In the first step, GlnD was eluted with an NaCl concentration between 300 and 400 mM. In the affinity column it was eluted with 600 mM NaCl. The lower yield of GlnD compared to both GlnB and GlnK was probably due to the low GlnD solubility. As occurred with the PII proteins, a substantial percentage of GlnD was lost during the ion exchange chromatography, but this step was important to obtain a highly pure GlnD, despite the low yield (Table 2). The protocols used in this work to purify the H. seropedicae PII and GlnD proteins are simpler than those used for E. coli proteins [21], the protein preparations had similar purity and they were active in uridylylation assays.

Total protein was measured by the Bradford method [38]. Purity was determined by densitometric analyses of purification step samples loaded on SDS­PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue R250. Yield was calculated as the ratio of the amount of purified protein achieved and the amount present in the previous step.

H. seropedicae GlnB and GlnK proteins were uridylylated by purified GlnD The uridylylation system was reconstituted in vitro using purified GlnB or GlnK (2 lM) and low concentrations of GlnD (50 or 100 nM), as described in Materials and Methods. The reactions were initiated by adding the second substrate UTP and stopped with loading buffer containing 20 mM EDTA. The GlnB and GlnK uridylylation status was determined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which allows separation of the four possible forms of the PII proteins (non uridylylated, PII (UMP)1, PII (UMP)2 and PII (UMP)3). Each UMP residue added to the protein increases the PII trimers' migration rate, so the more uridylylated the protein, the faster it migrates. The purified PII proteins had only one band in the native gel, indicating that these proteins were purified in the non-uridylylated form. Also, no uridylylated forms of either GlnB or GlnK were observed in the absence of GlnD or UTP (Fig. 4). On the other hand, all three uridylylated forms of GlnB and GlnK were observed in the complete reaction mixtures containing 200 lM of ATP, 5 mM of 2oxoglutarate and 50 or 100 nM of GlnD (Fig. 4). The GlnB protein was 60% uridylylated in the presence of 50 nM

GlnD and 86% with 100 nM GlnD, while GlnK was 52 and 67% uridylylated, respectively. This difference was also observed when the reaction was carried out at different times (Fig. 5). After the first 5 min, the percentage uridylylation of GlnB was 75% while that of GlnK was 38%. Thus, under these conditions, GlnB uridylylation was more efficient than that of GlnK. Unlike the E. coli results, where GlnK was uridylylated nearly as well as GlnB [9], in H. seropedicae the difference in uridylylation of PII proteins was more accentuated. These results suggest that an additional fine-tuning mechanism of this signal transduction system may operate in H. seropedicae involving the two paralogues GlnB and GlnK. The uridylylation of both PII proteins by H. seropedicae GlnD was absolutely dependent upon the presence of ATP and 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 4), as observed for E. coli PII proteins [3,4,9,21]. Previously, Benelli et al. [36] reported that either ATP or 2-oxoglutarate was necessary for H. seropedicae GlnB uridylylation, but those results were obtained using crude extracts of H. seropedicae or partially purified E. coli GlnD. In E. coli glutamine inhibits the uridylylation reaction by binding the central complex GlnD-GlnB [8]. H. seropedicae GlnB and GlnK uridylylation reactions were observed for different times in the presence or absence of glutamine (Fig. 5). Results showed an inhibition of 65% of GlnB uridylylation and 70% of GlnK uridylylation in the presence of glutamine. This pattern of inhibition is different from that observed with the E. coli PII proteins, where the inhibition by glutamine of the GlnB uridylylation was stronger than GlnK [9]. Further studies are necessary to determine if this effect reflects a difference in GlnK structure or a different response of H. seropedicae GlnD to glutamine.

The diversity of PII regulation systems among organisms probably reflects different responses to ambient variation. Thus, studies with PII proteins can reveal refinements of the regulatory mechanisms present in similar, but not completely identical systems. Since PII proteins have many targets, the in vitro assays allow partitioned studies, directed at specific targets. Our results indicate that the H. seropedicae GlnD, GlnB and GlnK proteins can be purified in their active forms. They can therefore be used to study their involvement in the control of other PII targets. Acknowledgments We are grateful to Dr. M. G.
