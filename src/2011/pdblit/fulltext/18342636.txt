1. Introduction
Chemical modification of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF,) in situ caused energy-transfer inhibition [l-3] of photophosphorylation and revealed essential arginyl [ 1,4] and lysyl [2,3] residues. When CF 1 in situ was modified by pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) [3] , the a, fl and y subunits were equally labeled and phosphorylation was inhibited. For 50% inhibition, 1 mol PLP was found in each of these 3 subunit fractions per mol CF 1_Since CFr has an allotopic nature [5] , it was of interest to examine PLP modification on isolated CFr , which was thus isolated from thylakoids, modified by PLP, then assayed for the heat-activated Ca"-ATPa.se [6] . It was found that modification of only 1 lysyl residue/CFr inactivated the Ca*`-ATPase completely. For 50% inhibition, 0.5 mol PLP was found in each of the (Yand /3 subunit fractions per mol CFr , but none in the y subunit fraction.

through a column (1 X 13 cm) of Sephadex G-25, then placed in a medium containing 20 mM tricineNaOH (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM ATP and 2 mM dithiothreitol and incubated at 62°C for 2.5 min to activate the latent ATPase [6,9] . The Ca*`-ATPase was assayed for liberated Pi at 37°C and pH 8.5 by the method in [IO] . Protein was assayed as in [ 111 . For the total amounts of bonded PLP per CF, (mol. wt 325 000 [ 12]), PLP was determined either by Aa2s, using e 1 X lo4 M-' .cm-' for NE-phosphopyridoxyl lysine [ 131, or by the radioactivity of [3H]PLP which was synthesized by the method in [14] and bonded to CF, as above. For the distribution of PLP among subunits of CF,, [3H]PLP-bonded CFr was electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide disc gel (10%) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (0.1%). The radioactivity on the gel slices was compared with the stained pattern of the subunits as in [3].

3. Results and discussion 2. Materials and methods CFr was isolated from spinach chloroplasts by the method in [7] except that the density gradient centrifugation was omitted. CFr (200-300 gg) was mixed in a medium containing 20 mM tricine-NaOH (PH 8 .O), 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgClz and a given concentration of PLP, incubated for a given time at 15°C in the dark, then modified by reducing the Schiff base complex with NaBHa [8] . PLP was thus covalently bonded to CFr . The CFr after PLP modification was passed 276 Figure 1 shows the incubation-time dependence of the amounts of bound PLP and the extent of Ca*+ATPase inactivation. Both saturate after incubation for >30 mm, depending on the concentration of PLP in the modification mixture. After the incubation of CFr with 80 /.JMPLP for 2 h, 1.2 mol PLP were bound per mol CF 1. When the same modification mixture was diluted lo-times with the buffer before the NaBH4 reduction, the amounts of bound PLP decreased after dilution, following first order kinetics and after 1 h 0.1 mol PLP/CFr

This implies that the Schiff base formation between CFr and PLP is reversible unless the base is reduced. When NaBHa was decomposed by trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (5%) at either 5 s or 5 min after the addition of NaBH4 to the modification mixture that had been incubated for 1 h, the equal amounts of PLP were found in both CFr .samples. These results indicate that the rate of PIP-CFr bond formation is sufficiently fast (cf. equilibrium shift rate), so that the amount of bound PLP represents the PLI-CFr complex (Schiff base) present at the instance of NaBH4 addition. When ATP or ADP was present in the modification mixture the Ca2'-ATPase activity was preserved in the CFi after modification (see fig.3). This suggests that PLP binds close to or at the binding site(s) for adenine nucleotides, or that these nucleotides are effecters for a conformation change of CFr which masks the PLP binding site. The amounts of bonded PLP per CF, were measured in the presence or absence of 2 mM ATP and analyzed in Scatchard plots [ 151 assuming binding equilibrium. The plots shown in fig.2 suggest the presence of >lO binding sites, differing in affinity. Assuming 2 independent groups of PLP binding sites, the ratio (r), mol bound PLP/mol CFr , is given by [16]:

The binding constant for ATP was also estimated to be KATp = 3.5 X lo3 under the assumption that ATP competes with PLP at the high affinity site. It should be noted that in the absence of MgC12, PLP bound to the sites only with very low affinity and caused little inactivation of Ca"-ATPase [ 171 . Figure 3 shows the amounts of bound PLP and the ATPase activity against the PLP concentration in the modification mixture (after 1 h incubation). When isolated CFr was first activated for Ca2'-ATPase activity, then modified by PLP, the profiles were almost identical to those in fig.3. Thus PLP binds to the specific site(s) on the protein regardless of the ATPase being latent or active. In the absence of ATP, Ca"-ATPase inactivation 277

The differences due to ATP in the remaining activity and in the amounts of bound PLP/CFr (b) were plotted in, figAA (squares) and extrapolated to give a ratio of <l for complete inactivation. If multiple sites were modified simultaneously with the specific active site(s), the former extrapolation would give an overestimated ratio and the latter an underestimated one. Therefore, it is likely that modification of only 1 site on isolated CFr by PLP results in complete inactivation of Ca*`-ATPase. If this 1 (active) site binds either PLP or ATP, neglecting other non-specific sites, in the presence of both PLP and ATP at an equilibrium,

therefore, plots of l/F versus [PLP] should be linear at [E] total <[PLP] . The data in fig.3 were replotted in fig.4B to find this linear relationship from which

activity [3] . The absence of PLP from the y subunit of isolated CFr seems to be a reflection of the allotopic nature of CFr [5]. This may be related to the lack of inhibition of Ca"-ATPase of isolated CF, by orange I which inhibits photo- and acid-base-phosphorylation and light-thiol-activated Mg"-ATPase in chloroplasts in competition with nucleotide substrates (Y.M. et al. in preparation). Since there are at least pairs of cr and fi subunits [ 181 in 1 CF,, the complete inactivation of Ca2'ATPase by modification of a single PLP/CFr would require a sophisticated mechanism for ATPase action (see ]171). Present results suggest possible changes in the intra- and/or inter-subunit architecture of CFr when CFr is detached from the thylakoid, and the presence of 1 essential lysyl residue for Ca2'-ATPase in either the (Yor the 0 subunit per mol isolated CF 1.

Fig.5. Labelling of CF, subunits by [`H]PLP. CF, was incubated with 120 MM [`H]PLP for 1 h in the dark and fixed with NaBH,. Polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis was carried out with the CF, solution in the presence of SDS (0.1%). The gel was stained, sliced, digested by H,O, and determined for radioactivity as in (3). The Cal+ATPase activity of this CF, sample was found to be 35% of the control (without modification) and the ratio of bonded PLP/CF, was 1 S.

These values from the activity data (Kgpp KiTp)are close to and the corresponding K values from the binding data (KH and KATP). These results support the assumptions that have been made and suggest that the Ca"-ATPase activity is completely lost by PLP modification of only 1 site, most probably a lysyl residue [3] , which has the highest affinity to PLP. Figure 5 shows the distribution of [3H]PLP among the subunits of CFr separated on SDS-polyacrylamide disc gels [3] . Radioactivity was found in the (Yand /3 subunits to a much larger extent than in the y subunit. When Ca2+-ATPase activity was halved, about 0.5 mol PLP was found in each of the (Yand fl subunit fractions per mol CFr . Which of these subunits carries the active site has not been assigned yet. The membrane-bound CFI was modified by PLP with its (Y,p and y subunits and lost its catalytic
