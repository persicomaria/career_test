Natural and Non-natural Antenna Chromophores in the DNA Photolyase from Thermus Thermophilus
Tobias Klar,[a] Gebhard Kaiser,[b] Ulrich Hennecke,[c] Thomas Carell,*[c] Alfred Batschauer,[b] and Lars-Oliver Essen*[a]
X-ray crystallographic and functional analysis of the class I DNA photolyase from Thermus thermophilus revealed the binding of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as an antenna chromophore. The binding mode of FMN closely coincides with the binding of a deazaflavin-like chromophore in the related class I DNA photolyase from Anacystis nidulans. Compared to the R46E mutant, which lacks a conserved arginine in the binding site for the antenna chromophore, the FMN-comprising holophotolyase exhibits an eightfold higher activity at 450 nm. The facile incorporation of the flavin cofactors 8-hydroxy-deazariboflavin and 8-iodo-8demethyl-riboflavin into the binding site for the antenna chromophore paves the way for wavelength-tuning of the activity spectra of DNA photolyases by using synthetic flavins.

Introduction
One of the highly lethal types of DNA damage is the UV-B- and UV-C-mediated (l = 100≠320 nm) dimerization of two adjacent pyrimidines by a [2+2] cycloaddition. The thus formed cyclobutane≠pyrimidine dimer (CPD) has to be efficiently repaired for cell survival, and to ensure the genetic integrity of the ACHTUNGREorganism.[1] DNA photolyases are light-driven enzymes that recognize these CPD-like DNA lesions and cleave them in a catalytic process called photoreactivation, by using near-UV or blue light (l = 320≠500 nm).[2, 3] All known DNA photolyases contain a flavin in the reduced and deprotonated FADH¿ form, as a catalytic cofactor. Additionally, a second ancillary chromophore could be found in some well-studied CPD photolyases.[4≠6] For catalytic DNA repair, this cofactor acts as a light-harvesting chromophore in DNA photolyases. Although these light-harvesting chromophores are not essential for enzyme function, they increase the absorption efficiency and broaden the activity spectra of photolyases. Until recently, only two types of CPD photolyases have been described: one type uses 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF, lmax % 380 nm), and the other uses 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (8-HDF, lmax % 445 nm) as a lightharvesting chromophore. However, in many characterized CPD photolyases, including Arabidopsis thaliana, a second chromophore has not been identified yet.[7] For example, action spectra for the repair of CPD lesions in plants like sorgum, cucumber[8] and maize[9] indicated a maximum of activity at 400 nm. Although these action spectra might be consistent with a MTHF-like chromophore that experiences a similar protein-induced red-shift, as was observed in the Bacillus firmus photolyase (lmax % 410 nm), it cannot be excluded that other molecules might also function as light-harvesting chromophores in vivo. The first enzymatic step in the repair of a CPD lesion is the light-independent binding of CPD photolyase to the damaged DNA, and the recognition of the CPD lesion as a substrate. The excitation energy of a photon absorbed from the light-harvesting chromophore is rapidly passed onto the active, twofold ACHTUNGREreduced, catalytic flavin cofactor (FADH¿) through a Foerstertype mechanism.[10≠12] Afterwards an electron is transferred from the excited FADH¿ to the pyrimidine dimer, and causes the cleavage of this dimer. The catalytic cycle is closed by electron back-transfer to FADH∑ and regeneration of FADH¿ .[13, 14] So far, it has been concluded from structural studies on the class I CPD photolyase from Thermus thermophilus that this enzyme contains a cavity between its two domains that is the right size to enclose an 8-HDF molecule as an antenna chromophore. However, FMN was recently biochemically shown to be an alternative candidate for the antenna chromophore in the Thermus photolyase.[15] In this work, we present the crystal structure of Thermus photolyase with FMN bound as an antenna cofactor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the promiscuity of this chromophore[a] T. Klar, Prof. Dr. L.-O.

Antenna Chromophores in a Thermophilic Photolyase binding site by reconstituting the Thermus photolyase not only with FMN, but also with 8-HDF and a novel synthetic flavin, 8iodoflavin. Together with the X-ray crystallographic determination of the binding mode of these flavins inside the antenna chromophore-binding site, it should now be possible to broaden the activity spectrum for photolyase DNA repair by inserting various antenna chromophores with different spectral features that still allow efficient energy transfer to the catalytic FAD. flavin-mononucleotide (FMN) are present in the protein samples. Subsequent reconstitution of the recombinant Thermus photolyase with an excess of FMN, followed by gel filtration of the resultant holoenzyme, then extraction and quantitative analysis by HPLC gave FAD/FMN ratios of 1:1. By comparison, the R46E mutant that was engineered to lack a crucial residue for FMN binding (see below) showed no FMN binding at all. The recombinant Thermus holophotolyase that contained both FAD and FMN was dark green. This indicated the simultaneous presence of flavins in the semiquinone blue radical form and the fully oxidized yellow form. Partial reduction to the semiquinone form occurred during the protein-purification step on the blue Sepharose column by electron transfer from the Cibacron Blue F3G-A dye, which was covalently bound to the column material, to the catalytic flavin cofactor. By comparison, the photolyases from A. nidulans,[16] or from the R46E mutant of the Thermus enzyme, which both lack a second chromophore are blue when similarly purified from E. coli (Figure 1 A).[17] It is therefore likely that the FMN chromophore is predominantly bound in its oxidized state to the Thermus holophotolyase.

Results and Discussion
Purification and characterization of flavin binding The recombinant Thermus photolyase showed the partial loss of a flavin species during the high-salt elution from a Blue Sepharose CL-6B matrix.[15] Likewise, loosely bound flavin was observed in the filtrate during the concentration of native Thermus photolyase samples. Mass-spectrometric analysis of the flavin chromophores of the recombinant Thermus photolyase indicated that not only the FAD catalytic cofactor, but also the

Four of these water molecules are located in the plane of the isoalloxazine moiety, and the fifth is located at the 3'-hydroxyl group of the antenna's ribityl side chain. The planarity of the isoalloxazine ring is consistent with an oxidized state of the FMN antenna chromophore. A phosphate ion, which is found in the crystals of the apophotolyase and which forms a salt bridge to R104 and a hydrogen bond to S96, is mostly replaced by the terminal 4'-hydroxy group of the ribityl chain of the holophotolyase.

The 3'- and 4'-hydroxyls are hydrogen-bonded only to the guanidinium group of R104 (2.6  and 3.4 ). The 5'-phosphate is positioned near the broad portal of the antenna chromophore-binding site, and forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond to the 2'-hydroxyl, and one additional hydrogen bond to the side chain of T98 (2.4 ).

L.-O. Essen, T. Carell et al. native photolyase were soaked with 8-HDF after cocrystallization experiments in the presence of 8-HDF had failed. Difference electron density maps calculated at 1.95  resolution, and contoured at 1.0 s clearly indicated stoichiometric binding of 8-HDF to the antenna chromophore-binding site of this CPDphotolyase (Figure 2 B). Interestingly, the deazaflavin F420 that corresponds to 8-HDF, which had been esterified at its 5'-hydroxyl with an oligoglutamyl moiety, was not able to bind to the Thermus enzyme under these conditions. The binding mode of 8-HDF resembles closely the binding of FMN in the holoenzyme and of 8-HDF in the Anacystis photolyase (Figures 3 C and 4). The distance to the catalytic FAD is reduced to 15.4 , and the aromatic system of 8-HDF is offshifted by a translation of 0.7 , and a rotation of 5.38 compared to the FMN of the Thermus holoenzyme. Furthermore, the lack of a 5'-phosphate in 8-HDF allows the 5'-hydroxyl instead of the 4'-hydroxyl of FMN to form an hydrogen bond with R104. Despite the very similar binding of 8-HDF by the Anacystis photolyase, the residues interacting with the chromophore in the antenna chromophore-binding site are only partly conserved. For example, in the Thermus photolyase, F50 forms

FMN chromophore (W7NE1¿FMN¿O2: 4.7 ; W49CD1¿FMN¿ C7M: 6.4 ). However, only W7 makes a significant interaction with the isoalloxazine via the water molecule HOH81 by bridging between the indole group of W7, and the O2 carbonyl of the isoalloxazine (Figure 2 B, Figure 3 B). This water molecule is structurally highly conserved as it forms hydrogen bonds with the indole of W7, and the amide groups of H8 and V34 in the apophotolyase, as well as in the homologous Anacystis photolyase. The orientation of the amino acids in the immediate vicinity of the antenna cofactor are otherwise almost identical between the apo- and holophotolyase. 8-HDF in the antenna chromophore binding site of the Thermus photolyase From the structure of the Thermus apophotolyase, it was concluded that this enzyme, like the cyanobacterial photolyase from Anacystis nidulans has an antenna chromophore-binding site that may accommodate 8-HDF as an antenna chromophore.[6] However, in the genome sequence of Thermus thermophilus it was subsequently found that the genes essential for the biosynthesis of 8-HDF, cofG, and cofH are missing.[15] Accordingly, no other 8-HDF-, or F420-dependent enzymes from T. thermophilus have been described yet. To test whether the Thermus photolyase is capable of incorporating 8-HDF as an antenna chromophore, crystals of the

Antenna Chromophores in a Thermophilic Photolyase binding, because replacing it with glutamate causes a complete loss of the FMN binding. If partial charges and hydrophobicity play a major role in the selectivity of the antenna chromophore site, more hydrophobic C8 substituents might be more suitable for the incorporation of artificial flavins. Therefore, the flavin analogue, 8-iodoflavin was synthesized and soaked into native Thermus crystals. Indeed, the binding of 8-iodoflavin could be unambiguously observed at 2.6  resolution in the predicted binding mode (Figures 2 B and 3 C).

with V33 and L218 a hydrophobic backside for interactions with the isoalloxazine moiety (Figure 3 C); the corresponding residues of the Anacystis enzyme are replaced by a leucine and two flanking phenylalanines (L55, F35, F249). Likewise N39, which points its amide-group nitrogen into the pyrimidine ring of the isoalloxazine ring system is replaced with the hydrophobic residue I41 in the Anacystis photoylase. Interestingly, one difference may cause the preference of the Anacystis photolyase for 8-HDF. Along the site of the 8-hydroxyl, which is presumably deprotonated upon the binding of 8HDF to the enzyme,[18] stabilizing salt bridge interactions are not only made by the conserved residue R51 (Thermus: R46), but also by the lysine residue K248. The latter is replaced in the Thermus photolyase by A217, which provides additional space for the C7 and C8 methyl substituents of the isoalloxazine ring (Figures 3 C and 4). 8-Iodoflavin in the antenna chromophore binding site of the Thermus photolyase Considering the apparent promiscuity in the binding of flavinlike cofactors to the Thermus photolyase, several artificial flavin analogues like 8-demethyl-8-cyanoriboflavin, 8-demethyl-8aminoriboflavin, and roseoflavin were crystallographically examined for incorporation into the antenna chromophore-binding site. However, difference electron-density maps of native crystals that had been soaked with those compounds revealed only the native FMN in the antenna-binding site, as judged by the electron density present for the 5'-phosphate of FMN. A common feature of these flavin analogues is the expected positive polarization of their substituents at the C8 position of the isoalloxazine moiety. This might give rise to electrostatic repulsion due to the close proximity of the conserved arginine residue, R46, which is still compatible with the binding of FMN with its neutral C8 methyl group. This arginine R46, together with T42, R336, H337, and a phosphate or a chloride ion from the crystalization buffer, participates in binding of the FMN and 8-HDF complexes. However, R46 is crucial for the FMN

Conclusion
As already pointed out by Ueda et al.,[15] the eubacterial genus Thermus is missing enzymes for synthesizing or using deazaflavin cofactors like 8-HDF or F420. Therefore, the observed binding of FMN into the antenna chromophore-binding site most likely reflects the need for using an alternative, heat-resistant chromophore to 8-HDF or MTHF. As shown above, FMN is a functional, light-harvesting chromophore. The spectral characteristics of its oxidized state, light absorption with lmax ~ 445 nm and emission at 520 nm, are almost ideal for a Foerster-like energy transfer from FMN to the catalytic FAD cofactor. For example, the orientation parameter k2, which can be calculated from the crystal structure of the Thermus holophotolyase, is 3.4 for energy transfer from FMN to FADox. This value is close to the maximum of 4, which can be assumed by the orientation parameter in the Foerster equation. Whereas FMN might act as a highly efficient antenna for the photoreduction of the catalytic FAD cofactor, its role might be more limited during blue-light-driven DNA repair. Compared to the alternative antenna chromophores of photolyases, MTHF (lmax,em ~ 460≠480 nm[19, 20]) and 8-HDF (lmax,em ~ 470 nm[16]), the red-shifted emission spectrum of FMN at lmax,em ~ 520 nm is less favorable for directly exciting the catalytically active FADH¿ cofactor due to a significantly smaller overlap integral for the emission and absorption spectra of FMN and FADH¿ . By using mutants in the photoreduction pathway of the MTHF-type photolyase from E. coli, it was previously demonstrated that the E. coli photolyase performs up to 25 repair reactions with a fully reduced FADH¿ cofactor, before the electron that is transiently transferred to the CPD lesion for repair fails to return to the semireduced FAD cofactor.[21] Accordingly, if the Thermus photolyase exhibits a higher leakage rate for electrons during the catalytic process and energy transfer between FMN and FADH¿ is indeed less efficient, one might interpret the eightfold-improved repair rate in the presence of an FMN antenna and blue light (Figure 1 D) to be not by Foerster-like energy transfer onto the FADH¿ cofactor, as in the MTHF or 8-HDF

Together with the different characteristics of the studied CHTUNGREantenna molecules, FMN, 8-HDF, and 8-iodoflavin, it should A ACHTUNGREnevertheless be possible to perform wavelength tuning of the Thermus photolyase by using artificial flavin chromophores and photolyase variants whose antenna chromophore-binding sites were reengineered by molecular modeling and mutagenesis.
Subsequently, the supernatant was purified by using a Blue Sepharose CL-6B affinity column. Almost pure recombinant T. thermophilus photolyase eluted at a concentration of 1 m potassium chloride in an increasing salt gradient. After control on a 12 % SDSPAGE, green-yellowish colored fractions that contained the desired protein were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration on a concentrator (VivaScience, Hannover, Germany). Gel filtration chromatography with Sephacryl S200-HR as a final polishing step lead to the pure protein of outstanding stability. This procedure resulted in an overall yield of 35 mg of purified T. thermophilus CPD-photolyase per liter cell culture. Mass spectrometric analysis of cofactors released from the purified photolyase indicated that FMN is incorporated into the protein (data not shown). To quantify the chromophores from the recombinant Thermus photolyase, the FMN-reconstituted holophotolyase or the R46E mutant were digested in acetic acid≠NaOH, pH 4.0 (10 mm) with pepsin (1 mg mL¿1) at 4 8C for 16 h. In cases where the FAD and FMN standards were used as controls, the standards were substituted with BSA at the same concentration as the photolyase protein. Samples were extracted with chloroform once, and the chromophores were separated on a Nucleosil column 100≠10 C18 (250  4 mm; Macherey≠Nagel, Dueren, Germany) with a 11 mL 10≠60 % gradient of methanol in Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 (10 mm), at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min¿1. Quantification of the cofactors was performed by direct comparison of sample and standard peak areas. Measurement of photolyase activity and UV-visible spectroscopy: Measurements of photolyase activity were performed in reaction buffer (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 10 mm DTT) supplemented with 1 mg mL¿1 glucose oxidase (GOD), catalase (0.1 mg mL¿1) and glucose (10 mm) in a 3 mL cuvette that was covered with paraffin oil. Under these conditions, the oxygen was dissipated quantitatively by glucose oxidase within 200 min by tracking the change in colour of the oxygen-sensitive dye resazurin. Afterwards, photolyase was added to give a final concentration of 1 or 4 ng mL¿1 (wild-type) and 4 or 16 ng mL¿1 (R46E mutant), under red safelight conditions. Safelight conditions were maintained until the end of the enzyme assay. Photolyase was photoreduced by irradiation at a fluence rate of 2500 mmol m¿2 s¿1 for 15 min, with white light that was provided by a slide projector that was equipped with a 320 nm cut-off filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). The photolyase assay was performed according to ref.[29] with some modifications. In brief, UV-B-treated salmon sperm DNA (25 ng mL¿1) was added as a substrate, samples were mixed, and an aliquot was removed as a dark control. Afterwards, the cuvettes were exposed to photoreactivating UV-A light (lmax = 370 nm) with a fluence rate of 10 W m¿2 (30.9 mmol m¿2 s¿1) or blue light (lmax = 447 nm) with a fluence rate of 9.8 W m¿2 (37 mmol m¿2 s¿1) while under continuous stirring. 300 mL Aliquots were removed at time intervals of 4 min over 30 min, extracted once with phenol/chloroform and chloroform, and 50 mL aliquots of the aqueous phase were dispensed into the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate (Microlon, 96 K; Greiner, Germany). The DNA was bound to the wells by drying the samples at 37 8C overnight. The wells were washed five times with PBS-T (10 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl; 0.05 % Tween 20) and blocked with 3 % (w/v) BSA in PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer pH 7.4; 150 mm NaCl) for 1.5 h at 37 8C. After blocking, the wells were washed five times with PBS-T, and incubated afterwards with the primary antibody (50 mL, anti-thymine dimer, clone KTM53; Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, USA), which had been diluted 1:1000 in PBS for 1 h at 37 8C, followed by 5 wash steps with PBS-T. 50 mL of the

Experimental Section
Synthesis of the artificial flavins: 8-HDF was synthesized according to published protocols.[23, 24] 8-Demethyl-8-iodoriboflavin was prepared from 8-demethyl-8-aminoriboflavin[25] by a Sandmeyerlike reaction. Synthesis of the 8-Demethyl-8-iodoriboflavin: 8-Demethyl-8-aminoriboflavin (300 mg, 0.8 mmol) was dissolved in 2.5 m sulfuric acid (9 mL, 22.5 mmol) to give a dark red solution, and cooled to 0 8C. Solid NaNO2 (66 mg, 1 mmol) was added, and the solution was stirred for 5 min. Then urea (30 mg, 0.5 mmol) was added, and the solution was stirred for another 5 min at 0 8C, then transferred to 250 mL beaker that contained a vigorously stirred solution of KI (633 mg, 3.8 mmol) in water (9 mL). A strong evolution of nitrogen was observed. After a further hour of stirring at RT, the newly formed solid was collected by centrifugation, and recrystallized from water to yield 221 mg (57 %) of 8-Demethyl-8-iodoriboflavin. The structure was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and HRMS, and the purity was checked by HPLC. 1 H NMR (600 MHz, [D6]DMSO): d = 2.53 (s, 3 H), 3.44≠3.48 (m, 1 H), 3.60≠3.65 (m, 3 H), 4.19≠4.23 (m, 1 H), 4.61≠4.66 (m, 1 H), 4.73≠4.81 (m, 1 H), 8.02 (s, 1 H), 8.58 (s, 1 H), 11.43 ppm (s, 1 H); 13C NMR (150 MHz, [D6]DMSO): d = 26.8, 47.3, 63.2, 68.6, 72.6, 73.4, 110.5, 127.3, 130.1, 132.1, 134.7, 138.4, 138.7, 150.7, 155.3, 159.6 ppm; IR (solid, ATR): n = 1572, 1528, 843 cm¿1; MS (ESI): m/z (%): 489 (30 %, MH + ), 457 (43), 331 (100); HR-MS (ESI) calcd.: 489.0271, found: 489.0266; UV/Vis (H2O): lmax (e) = 447 (10 220), 386 (8277), 266 (21 377), 232 (20 537). Cloning and overproduction: A previously described protocol for the recombinant expression of Thermus CPD photolyase in E. coli[26] yielded relatively low amounts of purified enzyme. We significantly increased the overall amount by improving the expression and purification conditions as described below. The photolyase-coding gene was amplified from the genomic DNA of Thermus thermophilus HB8, and subcloned into the expression vector pET36b(+). The resulting construct was then transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells. The cells were grown for 20 h at 37 8C in terrific broth medium, and protein expression was controlled by autoinduction.[27, 28] The R46E mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the primers 5'-CAGGCCCGCTCCCTCGG-3' and 5'CCCCGAGGGAGCGGGCC-3' using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). The correctness of the PCR products was verified by DNA sequencing. Purification of Thermus photolyase and quantification of flavin chromophores: To purify the recombinant Thermus photolyase, resuspended cells were disrupted by an emulsifier (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada), followed by heat treatment for 15 min at 65 8C and centrifugation, which removed most E. coli proteins.

Antenna Chromophores in a Thermophilic Photolyase
1:2000 diluted secondary a-mouse antibody that was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were added to each well, and the plates were incubated again for 1 h at 37 8C. After incubation with the secondary antibody, the plates were washed with PBS-T (2  ), then with citrate phosphate buffer (24 mm, pH 5.0; 3  ). The horseradish peroxidase reaction was started by adding OPD solution (100 mL, 0.4 % o-phenylenediamine; 0.007 % H2O2 in citrate phosphate buffer) to each well. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 m H2SO4 (50 mL). Afterwards, the plates were read-out at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader (LambdaE, MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The resulting data were corrected by subtracting the absorbance of a reference well (no DNA), and were normalized against the mean value of t0. Linear regressions were fitted into the dataset, and slopes and intercepts were calculated by Origin (version Pro 7.5, OriginLab, North Hampton, MA, USA). The slopes were normalized by the enzyme concentrations and photon fluences, and the activities set in relation to the activity of wild-type Thermus photolyase at 370 nm. UV-visible spectra of photolyases in reaction buffer were recorded using a double-beam spectrophotometer (UV2401 PC, Shimadzu Cooperation, Kyoto, Japan). Crystallization: Hexagonal crystals were obtained by the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method after four days. Having grown out of previously built precipitate from a Tris/HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.5), containing 1.0 m (NH4)H2PO4 as precipitant, all of the green crystals showed very strong dichroism, and were very reproducible. To generate crystals with embedded flavin analogues (FMN, 8-HDF, 8IRF), native crystals were soaked by adding 0.1 mm of the appropriate cofactor directly to the crystallization solution. A period of 90 min was found to be sufficient to saturate the binding pocket with the flavin derivatives without destabilizing the crystals. Crystals were then frozen in liquid nitrogen after soaking in a cryoprotectant, which consisted of the crystallization buffer and an additional 30 % (v/v) of glycerol. Data collection was carried out in-house on a Bruker≠Nonius FR591 X-ray source, with a MAR345 detector, and on the synchrotron beamline BW7A at the DORIS III storage ring, DESY, Hamburg, which was equipped with a MAR CCD detector. All datasets were collected under cryo conditions at 100 K. Data processing was carried out using the programs MOSFLM and SCALA.[30] Data collection and structure solution: Thermus thermophilus photolyase was crystallized in space group P6122 with unit≠cell parameters a = b = 112.07, c = 140.54 , a = b = 908, g = 1208. The dimensions of single crystals were estimated to be approximately 1.0  1.0  0.8 mm. Datasets were collected from single frozen crystals to 1.95≠2.6  resolution for the native enzyme, and for crystals that had been soaked with flavin analogues (Table 1). Molecular ACHTUNGREreplacement (MOLREP)[31] was used to find the structure solution of the native T. thermophilus photolyase by using the already pubACHTUNGRElished crystal structure data from the isomorphous crystals of this enzyme (PDB ID: 1IQR).[6] The latter structural data was modified to eliminate information concerning FAD and solvent molecules. The resultant data were used as a basic dataset for further structural investigations and refinements. Interestingly, crystals that had been soaked with different cofactors usually came up to higher resolution limits and showed less mosaicity than native datasets. Manual rebuilding in O and subsequent cycles of refinement with Refmac5[32] yielded a structure that contained the polypeptide chain defined from G2≠D416, one FAD, the putative antenna cofactor, two phosphate ions, one chloride ion, and 235 water molecules per asymmetric unit. Final refinement led to R factors of R =

18.2 %, and Rfree = 22.5 % for the FMN-reconstituted photolyase. To achieve compatibility of datasets from native, and cofactor-soaked crystals, all data were scaled with SCALEIT.[30] Difference electron density maps were generated compared with native CPD-photolyase to observe differences in the binding mode of the antenna cofactor, the orientation of surrounding amino acids, and the cofactor itself. The coordinates and structure factors of the photolyase-chromophore complexes are deposited in the RCSB protein databank under the accession codes 2J07, 2J08, and 2J09.
