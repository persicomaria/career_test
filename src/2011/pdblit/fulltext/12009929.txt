Hongotoxin1 (HgTX1), a 39-residue peptide recently isolated from the venom of Centruroides limbatus, blocks the voltage-gated K+ channels Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.3 at picomolar toxin concentrations (Koschak, A., Bugianesi, R. M., Mitterdorfer, J., Kaczorowski, G. J., Garcia, M. L., and Knaus, H. G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 2639-2644). In this report, we determine the three-dimensional structure of HgTX1 using NMR spectroscopy (PDB-code: 1HLY). HgTX1 was found to possess a structure similar to previously characterized K+ channel toxins (e.g. margatoxin) consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel -sheet (residues 2-4, 26-30, and 33-37) and a helical conformation (part 310 helix and part R helix; residues 10-20). Due to the importance of residue Lys-28 for high-affinity interaction with the respective channels, lysine-reactive fluorescence dyes cannot be used to label wild-type HgTX1. On the basis of previous studies (see above) and our NMR data, a HgTX1 mutant (HgTX1-A19C) was engineered, expressed, and purified. HgTX1-A19C-SH was labeled using sulfhydryl-reactive Cy3-, Cy5-, and Alexa-dyes. Pharmacological characterization of fluorescently labeled HgTX1-A19C in radioligand binding studies indicated that these hongotoxin1 analogues retain high-affinity for voltage-gated K+ channels and a respective pharmacological profile. Cy3- and Alexa-dye-labeled hongotoxin 1 analogues were used to investigate the localization of K+ channels in brain sections. The distribution of toxin binding closely follows the distribution of Kv1.2 immunoreactivity with the highest expression levels in the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Taken together, these results demonstrate that fluorescently labeled HgTX1 analogues comprise novel probes to characterize a subset of voltage-gated K+ channels.

Current knowledge regarding the distribution and subunit composition of K+ channels arises mainly from the use of antibodies directed against various ion channel subunits (Sheng et al., 1993; Knaus et al., 1996; Shamotienko et al., 1997; Koch et al., 1997; Knaus et al., 1996; Shamotienko et al., 1997; Koch et al., 1997). These antibodies are essential tools to enable high-resolution distribution studies clarifying the expression pattern of various K+ channel subunits in various tissues or to establish their subunit composition (Shamotienko et al., 1997; Koch et al., 1997; Koschak et al., 1998; Koch et al., 1997; Koschak et al., 1998). However, production of selective antibodies is frequently hampered by a high degree of sequence conservation within several K+ channel subfamilies (Chandy and Gutman, 1993). Moreover, these antibodies do not comprise a suitable tool to study native K+ channels, as the tissues need to be fixed and

permeabilized in order to allow antibody access to its intracellular binding site. As an alternative, toxins have often been used to study native K+ channels, mostly in functional assays (Miller, 1995; Tytgat et al., 1999; Tytgat et al., 1999). These K+ channel toxins bind to the extracellular channel vestibule thereby physically occluding the ion conduction pathway (MacKinnon and Miller, 1988; MacKinnon and Miller, 1989; Gross and MacKinnon, 1996; Doyle et al., 1998; MacKinnon et al., 1998; MacKinnon and Miller, 1989; Gross and MacKinnon, 1996; Doyle et al., 1998; MacKinnon et al., 1998). Radioiodinated toxin analogues have extensively been used to map the distribution of toxin receptors through autoradiographic studies, to establish the pharmacological profile of various K+ channels through radioligand binding studies, or to purify K+ channels from native tissue thereby clarifying their subunit composition (Gehlert and Gackenheimer, 1993; Vazquez et al., 1990; Garcia-Calvo et al., 1994; Knaus et al., 1994; Vazquez et al., 1990; Garcia-Calvo et al., 1994; Knaus et al., 1994). However, use of these radioiodinated toxins for distribution studies is limited as the resolution of receptor autoradiography is notoriously low. To overcome these limitations, several attempts were made to generate fluorescently labeled K+ channel toxins. In most cases, direct fluorescence labeling procedures

were performed through incorporation via N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester chemistry into -amino groups of lysine residues (Darbon and Angelides, 1984; Angelides, 1986; Angelides, 1989; Jones et al., 1989; Cohen et al., 1991; Angelides, 1986; Angelides, 1989; Jones et al., 1989; Cohen et al., 1991). However, lysine derivatization is often not desirable as they comprise crucial residues for high-affinity toxin interaction with the K+ channel of interest (Park and Miller, 1992; Goldstein and Miller, 1993; Goldstein et al., 1994; Goldstein and Miller, 1993; Goldstein et al., 1994). Resulting toxin analogues often render a loss of affinity accompanied by an altered pharmacological profile. In this paper, we report the three-dimensional structure of HgTX11 determined through NMR experiments (PDB-code: 1HLY). On the basis of these NMR data and previous studies (Knaus et al., 1996; Koschak et al., 1998), we constructed, expressed, and purified a toxin analogue (HgTX1-A19C) which carries a single free sulfhydryl group in the `back' of the molecule, most opposite from the toxin's interaction surface with voltagegated K+ channels. This sulfhydryl group was used for derivatization with fluorescent dyes such as Cy3, Cy5, and the Alexa-dye-family. The resulting toxin analogues widely retain their pharmacological profile as shown in radioligand binding studies and fluorescence microscopy. Demonstrating one capability of these toxin analogues, HgTX1-A19C-Cy3 was used to monitor the distribution of Kv1 channels in native brain tissue. These toxin analogues will now allow `real time' imaging of channels on living cells or heterogeneous tissues. In this respect they will overcome several limitations known to exist for radioligands or sequence specific antibodies. Additionally, they will enable quantification of ligand binding on the cellular level, even in heterologous tissues, or at the subcellular level.

Cy3- and Cy5-NHS esters were purchased from Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany) while Cy5-PDP, Cy5-mal, and Cy3-mal were synthesized as described (Gruber et al., 2000). Alexa488-mal, Alexa546mal, Alexa594-mal, Alexa660-mal, and Alexa680-mal were obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR; supplied as isomeric mixtures). NMR Spectroscopy of Wild-Type HgTX1. Recombinant wild-type HgTX1 was produced as described previously (Koschak et al., 1998). Four milligrams of HgTX1 was dissolved in a 0.5 mL mixture of H2O and D2O in a 9:1 ratio (v/v). The pH value of the HgTX1 solution was 3.0 uncorrected for isotope effects. Amide proton exchange rate was determined after lyophilization and dissolution in 100% D2O. All 2D-1H NMR measurements were obtained on a BRUKER DRX 500 spectrometer equipped with an HCN probe. Self-shielded triple axis gradients were used as previously described (Blanc et al., 1998). To solve assignment ambiguities, the experiments were performed at 283 and 300 K. All data were processed using the UXNMR Bruker's software running on a Silicon Graphics Indy R4400 workstation. Identification of amino acid spin systems and sequential assignment were done using the standard method described by Wuthrich (Wuthrich, 1986). Distance geometry calculations were performed with the variable target function program DIANA 2.8 (Guntert et al., 1991) following the well-established strategy for scorpion toxin structure determination (Blanc et al., 1998). The visual analysis of resulting structures was carried out with the TURBO-FRODO graphic software running on Silicon Graphics workstations. The quality of the structures was assessed using both PROCHECK 3.3 and PROCHECK-NMR software (Laskowski et al., 1993). Plasmid Construction, Synthesis, and Purification of Recombinant HgTX1-A19C. The plasmid pG9HgTX1-A19C encodes a fusion protein of the T7 gene 9 product and HgTX1, separated by six histidine residues and the factor Xa cleavage site. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to create cDNA mutations in the primary sequence of HgTX1 described previously (Koschak et al., 1998). HgTX1-A19C was generated by introducing cysteine at position 19 thereby replacing alanine. Mutations were introduced by the "gene SOEing" technique using mutagenic forward and reverse PCR primers (Horton et al., 1989). Desired mutations were verified by cDNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977). The fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (Koschak et al., 1998). After purification of the fusion protein the toxin mutant was released by cleavage with trypsin. Purified fusion protein (20-40 mg) was incubated with 190 µL of trypsin solution (1 mg/100 µL H2O) for 15 min at 22 °C. The cleavage mixture was applied to a cation-exchange column (MonoS HR5/5; Pharmacia) and HgTX1-A19C was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.75 M NaCl in 20 mM borate pH 8.0 (over 40 min) at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Cation exchange chromatography yielded two distinct peptide fractions (see Results). Each peptide fraction was applied separately to a C18 reversed-phase column (Vydac, 1 × 25 cm, 23 °C), and the respective toxin analogue was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA (over 40 min) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min. Approximately equal amounts of two individual peptide isoforms, HgTX1A19C- ME and dimeric HgTX1-A19C were obtained (see Results). Composition of the purified material was veri-

fied by electrospray mass spectrometry. Aliquots were lyophilized and stored at -80 °C. Reduction of Dimeric HgTX1-A19C and HgTX1A19C- ME. For reduction of dimeric HgTX1-A19C and HgTX1-A19C- ME, aliquots of the respective peptides were dissolved in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 10 mM DTT and incubated for 15 min at 22 °C. The reaction mixture was applied to a C18 reversedphase column (Vydac, 0.45 × 25 cm, 23 °C). Reduced HgTX1-A19C (HgTX1-A19C-SH) was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA (over 40 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min and stored as described above. Synthesis of Fluorescently Labeled Hongotoxin1 Analogues. Conjugation of Cy5-PDP to HgTX1-A19CSH. Cy5-PDP was synthesized as described for Cy5-mal (Gruber et al., 2000). Cy5-PDP was dissolved in 25% AcN and 0.05% TFA (in H2O), an equimolar amount of HgTX1A19C-SH was added, and the reaction mixture was lyophilized. The reaction was started by addition of 100 µL aqueous buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.5 adjusted with NaOH, deoxygenated with N2). The mixture was incubated under N2 for 90 min at 37 °C (see Figure 3) and applied to a C18 reversed-phase column (Vydac, 0.45 × 25 cm, 23 °C). HgTX1-A19C-Cy5 was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA (over 40 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Conjugation of Cy5-mal and Cy3-mal to HgTX1-A19CSH. Cy5-mal and Cy3-mal were synthesized as described for Cy5-mal (Gruber et al., 2000). A 3- or 5-fold molar excess of thiol-teactive Cy-dye was dissolved in 100 µL of aqueous buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH) and applied to a vial containing lyophilized HgTX1-A19C-SH. The reaction mixture was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C (see Figure 3) and applied to a C18 reversed-phase column (Vydac, 0.45 × 25 cm, 37 °C). HgTX1-A19C-Cy5 and HgTX1-A19C-Cy3 were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA (over 40 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Due to the excess of dye no oxidation (dimerization) of the peptide could be detected. Conjugation of Alexa488-mal, Alexa546-mal, Alexa594mal, Alexa660-mal, and Alexa680-mal to HgTX1-A19CSH. A 25 µg or 50 µg amount of thiol-reactive Alexa-dye was dissolved in 200 µL of aqueous buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH) and applied to a vial containing lyophilized HgTX1-A19C-SH. The reaction mixture was incubated for 120 min at 37 °C (see Figure 3) and applied to a C18 reversed-phase column (Vydac, 0.45 × 25 cm, 23 °C). HgTX1-A19CAlexa488, HgTX1-A19C-Alexa594, HgTX1-A19C-Alexa660, and HgTX1-A19C-Alexa680 were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 35% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA (over 40 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. HgTX1-A19CAlea546 was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 45% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA (over 50 min) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Due to the excess of dye no oxidation (dimerization) of the peptide could be detected. The structure of the compounds was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. Aliquots of fluorescently labeled hongotoxin1 analogues were lyophilized and stored at -80 °C. Nano-Electrospray Mass Spectrometry. Nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry was performed with a Finnigan LCQ mass spectrometer equipped with a micromanipulator for the correct positioning of the nanospray needle. In short, capillaries (GC120F from Clark Instruments, Reading, United Kingdom) were pulled using the DMZ-universal puller (Zeitz-Instrumente GmbH,

Munchen, Germany). They were coated with gold using ¨ a Polaron SC7610 Sputter Coater (VG Microtech, Uckfield, United Kingdom) and a gold target. These needles were filled with 1-4 µL of aqueous solution and centrifuged for several seconds using a PicoFuge (Tomy Capsule, Tomy Tech Inc, Palo Alto, CA). The needles were mounted on the micromanipulator and were gently brought in contact with a surface near the inlet of the mass spectrometer. Air pressure was applied to the needle until a small droplet appeared on the tip. The needle was then adjusted 2.5 mm opposite the inlet of the heated cappillary. A potential of 900 V was applied to the needle. For measurements of aqueous solutions, the relative intensities of the corresponding peaks were maximized when the collision-induced decay at the inlet of the mass spectrometer was minimized. The tuning procedure of the mass spectrometer was applied for this purpose. The original data (i.e. abundance of the multiple charged peptide populations versus m/z) were deconvoluted into mass spectra (relative abundance versus mass) by means of the deconvolution software BioExplore. The error of the mass spectrometer was 100 ppm in the normal mass range (150-2000 m/z), which was used for all experiments. Membrane Preparation and Binding Studies. Rat brain synaptic plasma membrane vesicles were prepared as previously described (Knaus et al., 1995). Membrane vesicles from HEK293 cells stably transfected with homotetrameric Kv1.3 channels were prepared as described (Helms et al., 1997). Binding experiments were carried out as previously described (Knaus et al., 1995). The incubation medium consisted of 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA (rat brain membranes) or 20 mM TRIS/ HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM KCl, 0.1% BSA (HEK-Kv1.3 membranes). Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 nM recombinant HgTX1 or MgTX, and incubation was carried out at 22-25 °C typically for 240 min. Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical distribution studies using an antibody directed against the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.2 (anti-Kv1.2(461-480)) were performed as previously published in detail (Koch et al., 1997). Labeling of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 Channels with Fluorescent HgTX1-A19C Analogues. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their brains were rapidly removed and placed for 90 s in isopentane chilled to -40 °C. Thereafter, brains were transferred for 30 min at -30 °C and 10 µm horizontal sections were cut on a cryostat (Leitz, Germany) and thaw-mounted onto gelatin-coated glass slides. Sections were labeled in 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, and 0.1% BSA for 12 h at 4 °C at a saturating concentration of HgTX1-A19C-Alexa488, HgTX1-A19C-Cy3, or HgTX1-A19C-Alexa546 (2 nM). Nonspecific binding was determined in adjacent sections by inclusion of 100 nM HgTX1. Sections were then rinsed four times 2 min each with in ice-cold 20 mM TRIS/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl. For fluorescence microscopy, the sections were embedded in pPD glycerol (30 mg of p-phenylendiamine dissolved in 10 mL of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0/90% glycerol (v/v), coverslipped, and sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence images of the sections were obtained using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a 40 × 1.3 NA oil immersion objective, a 20 × 0.5 NA objective, and a standard Rhodamine and FITC filter set. Images were captured by a Peltier cooled slow-scan CCD-camera system (Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany) at short exposure times (0.5-2 s)

RESULTS

NMR Spectroscopy of Wild-Type HgTX1. Approximately 10 mg of native HgTX1 was purified from a 4 L of E. coli culture as described previously (Koschak et al., 1998) and a total of 4 mg of HgTX1 subjected to NMR studies. Using this amount of toxin we were able to assign all spins unambiguously and to connect them in sequence. We collected a total of 380 NOEs which were then converted into distance constraints (144 intraresidue constraints, 109 sequential constraints, 41 medium range, and 59 long-range constraints). Study of the amide proton exchange rates led to the localization of 18 hydrogen bonds which were also converted into distance constraints. Finally, 27 measured coupling constants were converted into as many angle constraints. The distance geometry calculations led to a single family of 25 structures. These structures, containing nonbonded bad contacts, were energy-minimized with the Powell algorithm of the XPLOR3.1 software (Brunger, ¨ 1992). The final set of 25 structures after energy minimization is of good quality as demonstrated by ProcheckNMR analysis. The negative van der Waals energy indicates the absence of nonbonded contacts. The correlation with the experimental restraints shows neither distance violation greater than 0.25 Å, nor angle violation greater than 5°. The low root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) values of the bond lengths (0.012 Å) and the valence angles (2.9 Å) indicates that the covalent geometry is preserved for all 25 structures. The analysis of the Ramachandran plot shows (in PROCHECK software nomenclature) 80% of the residues in the most favored, 19% in the additional allowed regions, 1% in the generously allowed regions, and none in disallowed regions. The final 25 calculated structures share the same fold and thus form a homologous family. The RMSD value of these 25 structures versus the calculated average structure is 0.57 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.10 Å for all heavy atoms. As shown in Figure 1, the backbone structure is well-defined all along the sequence. The results of structure analysis using TURBO-FRODO (Roussel and Cambillau, 1989) and PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that residues G10 to C20 are in helical conformation with the first three residues in 310 helix conformation and the seven following in pure R-helix. Further analysis of the distribution of / angles and the location of hydrogen bonds indicated that three segments, 2 to 4, 26 to 30, and 33 to 37 form a threestranded antiparallel -sheet. This -sheet is right-hand twisted and stabilized by standard hydrogen bonds. The two last strands of the -sheet are connected by a welldefined type I -turn centered between 31 and 32 (Margolskee et al., 1993). This -sheet is connected to the R-helix through an R/ 5 loop (Jones et al., 1989; Cohen et al., 1991; Park and Miller, 1992; Goldstein and Miller, 1993; Goldstein et al., 1994). On the basis of previous studies (Knaus et al., 1996; Koschak et al., 1998) and the NMR structure of HgTX1, we were able to predict that mutations in position 19 will significantly alter neither the toxin's overall structure nor its interaction with the channel since this residue is located in the `back' of the peptide, its side chain is oriented toward the solvent (see Figure 1) and it does not form part of the

peptide's interaction surface with K+ channels (Miller, 1995). Thus, we altered the synthetic HgTX1 gene thereby substituting Ala19 for Cys19 (Koschak et al., 1998). Expression and Purification of HgTX1-A19C. To obtain sufficient amounts of peptide for derivatization with fluorescence dyes, HgTX1-A19C was recombinantly expressed in E. coli as part of a fusion protein (Figure 2A). Induction of the respective fusion protein was comparable to wild-type HgTX1 (we determined an induction of 40-80 mg of protein/1500 mL of E. coli culture, data not shown). However, the final yield after cation exchange and reversed-phase chromatography was estimated to be only 11 ( 4% of the calculated theoretical yield (corresponding to 440-720 µg of HgTX1-A19C/1500 mL of E. coli culture; n ) 4). We currently favor the idea that the introduction of an additional Cys residue in position 19 impairs proper formation of the internal disulfide bonds of the toxins. Such an incompletely folded toxin analogue is expected to possess much lower resistance to trypsin and would therefore be degraded upon proteolytic release from the fusion protein (Koschak et al., 1998). After partial purification of the fusion protein and cleavage with trypsin to release HgTX1-A19C-SH, the peptide was purified to homogeneity by cation-exchange (Figure 2B) and C18 reversed-phase chromatography (Figure 2C). Cation-exchange chromatography yielded two distinct peptide fractions. Both peptides were subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry which yielded molecular weights of 4329.0 and 8506.0 Da, respectively (see Table 1). However, the calculated Mr for HgTX1A19C-SH is 4253 Da, a number which is significantly lower than that measured by mass spectrometry. The observed molecular weights are explainable by the formation of a disulfide bond between residue Cys19 (Mr 8506.0) or ME derivatization of this sulhydryl group of Cys19 (Mr 4329.0). Similar observations have been made for an IbTX mutant (which is preferentially isolated as a ME derivative (Knaus et al., 1996)) and for an AgTX2

a To ascertain whether HgTX , HgTX -A19C- ME, (HgTX 1 1 1 A19C)2, and a variety of fluorescently labeled HgTX1-A19C analogues display a similar affinity for heterotetrameric native Kv1 channels, binding competition experiments using [125I]HgTX1A19Y/Y37F were performed. As a tissue source, rat brain synaptosomal membranes were used. IC50, concentration causing halfmaximal inhibition.

mutant (this toxin analogue quantitatively dimerizes during folding and isolation (Krezel et al., 1995)). The individual fractions were tested for activity in [125I]HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F binding to rat brain synaptosomal plasma membranes. Dimeric HgTX1-A19C was a less potent inhibitor of [125I]HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F binding to rat brain synaptosomal plasma membranes compared to HgTX1-A19C- ME and wild-type HgTX1 (see Table 2). Synthesis of Fluorescently Labeled Hongotoxin1 Analogues. To selectively reduce the disulfide bond in the back of the toxin without disrupting the integrity of the internal disulfide bridges, both HgTX1-A19C- ME

and dimeric HgTX1-A19C were incubated with DTT under carefully controlled conditions (see Methods). The peptide carrying a free sulfhydryl group (HgTX1-A19CSH) was easily identified by a change in retention time upon reversed-phase HPLC (Figure 2). The reduced toxin (HgTX1-A19C-SH) was subjected to mass spectral analysis. A molecular weight of 4253 Da was determined which was identical to the calculated molecular weight. The reduction yield after reversed phase chromatography was estimated to be 90 ( 5% (n > 10). Equimolar amounts of HgTX1-A19C-SH and the sulfhydryl-reactive Cy5-PDP were incubated in order to synthesize the respective fluorescently labeled toxin. For all other fluorescent dyes, a molar excess (see Experimental Procedures) over toxin was employed. The fluorescently labeled toxin mutants were isolated by reverse phase chromatography (see Figure 4) and the postulated structure (see Figure 3) was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry (see Table 1). The coupling yield after reversed-phase chromatography was estimated to be 95 ( 5% (n > 10). Noteworthy, coupling of HgTX1-A19C-SH to maleimides will generate an asymmetric carbon and therefore lead to the formation of diastereomers (see Figure 3B). Pharmacological Characterization of Fluorescently Labeled HgTX1-A19C. To ascertain that wildtype HgTX1 and the respective fluorescently labeled toxin analogue display similar affinities for native Kv1 channels, binding competition experiments using [125I]HgTX1A19Y/Y37F were performed (Figure 7). As a tissue source, either rat brain synaptosomal membranes (which pre-

dominantly express heterotetrameric Kv1 channels formed by assembly of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 (Koch et al., 1997)) or HEK-293 plasma membranes stably transfected with Kv1.3 were used (Figure 7). In both membrane preparations, [125I]HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F binds to a single class of sites that display a Kd of 0.15 pM (Koschak et al., 1998). The toxin analogue HgTX1-A19C- ME retains this very high affinity for Kv1.1/1.2 channels as it displaces [125I]HgTX1-A19Y/Y37F binding with an identical (compared to wild-type HgTX1) IC50 value of 0.6 pM (see Table 2; n ) 6). The respective dimeric toxin (HgTX-A19C)2 suffers an approximately 10-fold loss in affinity (see Table 2; n ) 6). In good agreement with these data, HgTX1-A19C-Cy5 displaces [125I]HgTX1A19Y/Y37F binding from native Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channels as well as from recombinant Kv1.3 channels with IC50 values of 11.6 pM (n ) 4) and 1.3 pM (n ) 2), respectively (Figure 7, open squares). By comparison, wild-type HgTX1 inhibited [125I]HgTX1-A19Y/ Y37F interactions with these membranes with IC50 values of 0.49 pM (n ) 3) and 0.16 pM (n ) 2), respectively (Figure 7, circles). These data indicate that HgTX1-A19C-Cy5 binds to voltage-gated potassium channels with a slightly reduced binding potency (see Table 2). To investigate the pharmacological profile of the other fluorescently labeled HgTX1 analogues, they were screened in binding competition experiments using [125I]HgTX1A19Y/Y37F and native Kv1.1/1.2 channels. All toxin analogues retain high affinity and a proper pharmacological profile (see Table 2; n ) 6).

The binding reaction was specific as no fluorescence signal was observed in the presence of 100 nM unlabeled HgTX1 (data not shown). Under controlled conditions HgTX1A19C-Cy3 labeling resulted in specific staining of morphologically and anatomically well-defined neuronal structures which correspond to the immunohistochemical staining pattern using sequence-directed antibodies. The most prominent fluorescence signal was detected in the Purkinje cell layer of the rat cerebellum (Figure 8). This subregion of the cerebellum is known to harbor the highest density of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channels of the entire rat

The channels are situated at pinceau terminalssgiant basket cell synapses wrapping around the base of the Purkinje cell. Parallel experiments using a sequence-directed antibody against the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.2 displayed a very similar distribution pattern (Figure 8B/D). Moreover, HgTX1-A19C-Alexa488 and HgTX1-A19C-Alexa546 show an identical distribution pattern compared to HgTX1-A19C-Cy3 (Figure 9). In summary, the experiments confirm the suitability of this toxin for distribution

studies of voltage-gated K+ channel either in isolated cells (e.g. neurons in primary culture; recombinant channels in mammalian cell lines) or complex tissues (e.g. the brain).
DISCUSSION

Until now, fluorescently labeled K+ channel toxins were synthesized by either covalent modification of lysine residues or toxin biotinylation (e.g. charybdotoxin (Robitaille et al., 1993) or apamin (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR)). However, in many instances, these procedures generate toxin analogues with reduced binding affinity and/or altered pharmacological profiles (H.G.K., unpublished observation). To circumvent these obstacles and to generate a fluorescently labeled HgTX1 analogue which closely resembles wild-type HgTX1 thereby preserving affinity and pharmacology, we adapted a recently developed strategy to radiolabel a structurally related toxin, namely IbTX, with [3H] (Knaus et al., 1996). Our experiments were governed by studies in which ChTX (Goldstein et al., 1994), IbTX (Mullmann et al., 1999), KTX (Aiyar et al., 1996), and AgTX2 (Gross and MacKinnon, 1996) were subjected to an extensive site-directed mutagenesis paradigm, coupled to functional screening of these mutant toxin analogues. These studies allowed the clear assignment of residues which are crucial for high affinity interaction with the respective channels. In addition, the NMR data presented in this paper enabled us to clearly assign residues which are known to be located opposite from the toxin's interaction surface with the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.3 (Aiyar et al., 1995). As examplified for HgTX1-A19C-Cy3, ion channel expression and distribution can be investigated in brain sections thereby complementing or even substituting antibody staining experiments. This approach offers the definite advantage that the respective tissue under investigation does not need to be fixed nor permeabilized before the staining reaction is performed. In contrast to all sequence-specific antibodies directed against individual ion channel subunits (which mostly recognize epitopes located on the intracellular side of the channel),

Native 10 µm rat brain sections were incubated with 2 nM of HgTX1-A19C-Alexa488 (A), HgTX1-A19C-Alexa546 (B), and HgTX1-A19C-Cy3 (C) overnight at 4 °C.

most ion channel toxins bind to extracellular sites within the channel's vestibule (Gross and MacKinnon, 1996; Aiyar et al., 1995). In two very recent reports, we have shown that this toxin analogue can also be utilized to image individual ion channels in living cells by means of single dye tracing (SDT) experiments (Schutz et al., ¨ 2000a; Schutz et al., 2000b; Schutz et al., 2000a). For ¨ ¨ the first time, individual membrane proteins were visualized at a three-dimensional position of 40 nm. Besides studying individual ion channels at high spatial resolution through SDT experiments, a number of additional questions can now be addressed using fluorescently labeled K+ channel toxins utilizing this general principle. Ion channel distribution studies could be extended to cultured neurons in order to address developmental changes in channel expression in distinct neuronal structures through fluorescence microscopy. An additional application is the monitoring of recombinant channel expression in, for example, mammalian cell lines. Individual cells could be screened based on the fluorescence signal, channel expression could be quantified, and

a single cell could be harvested and replated. Moreover, as only channels residing in the plasma membrane would be detected, precise information on the surface expression level could be obtained. Soon this approach is going to be extended to produce and characterize additional ion channel-selective toxin analogues (e.g. iberiotoxin for BK channels or -conotoxin GVIA for a subset of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels). We aim to derivatize all these toxins by means of Forster ¨ donor-acceptor dye pairs (e.g. Cy3/Cy5 or Cy5/Cy5.5) and utilize them in fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies. Together with commercially available fluorescently labeled ion channel probes (e.g. dihydropyridines), these tools will help to address the issue of ion channel colocalization by means of two-photon laser miscroscopy and/or SDT experiments in native tissue.
