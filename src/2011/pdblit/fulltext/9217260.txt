A series of ~+nitrolllrenyl esters, whoac rates of basic hydrolysis varied orer lOO-fold, were synthesized. The throm~)in-~ntHl~z(,(l hydrolysis did not. follow the relatit-e order of the non-enzymicn breakdown of thew substratw. but il showed a range of turnovers of about 2500-fold in going from p-nitrophcnyl acetate through acetylglg&atc, iodoacetate, ncetyl-L-leucinate, carhobenzoxygl?~inate to ~~~rhobcnzoxy-L-l~l~en~lalani~~~~tt an d cnrbobenzoxg+tyrosinntc. The laiter two compounds are us good thrombin substrates as Na-JAosyl-L-:argininc methyl txstvr. It is wnc~ludcd that the presence of an anolar Dhenvl plays an important part in pro_ _ " side chain in the subetratc> molwul~ moting its hytlrolysis by the enzyme. INTRODUCTIOS /+Sitrophcnyl cbz-L-tyrosinate was kindly given to us by Dr. T. Kaiser of &is Department. Amino acid derivatives used in the synthesis of nitrophrnyl esters were purchased from Mann Re~:arc~h Laboratories with the exception of cbz-tphenylalanine which was prepared as follows. To a solution of 1 g. (0.006 mole) of L-phenylalanine in 20 ml. of 2 S sodium hydroxide was added with I,apitl stirring at O", 1.2 g. (0.007 mole) of carbobenzoxychloride which was follo~~ed immediately by another addition of 20 ml. of 2 S sodium hytlroxitle o\-cr a lwiod of 20 min. Upon completion of this :&li~ion, t.he rraction mixture was filtered and the filkate was cxxtrncted with ether. The f,i ller extract was then coml)ined with the crystallint material vollccted atmvc, and the oil which Lwl):~rnted out was remoretl. The ether JWS evnporaled yielding crystalline ~l)z-1.-I~hen~l~~l:tnine with a melting point of 85-88". The I)-nil-rophenyl esters lvere prepared according to the method of Bodanszky and dul'ignealltl (2). To a solution of the substituted amino acid and :I 20% excess of rerrystallized p-nitrophenol in 200 ml. ethyl acetate was added lvith rapid stirring at 0" an equimolnr amount of dicyclollex~lc~:lrhodiimitic (Aldrich Chemicals), The misturn was then stirred for half an hollr at 0" and for 1 hr. at room tcmpcrature.

Though thrombin is known to be a good cat,alyst for hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl carbobenzoxy (cbzj -L-tyrosinate (1)) we found it' to be a very poor enzyme for p-nitrol)henyl acetate. The difference might be explained by one or more of the following. The tyrosine ester contains a nitrogen atom, alpha to the ester bond, rendering it more susceptible perhaps to basic hydrolysis in general. The carbobenzoxy and amide resiclues, t'hc phcnyl side chain or the phenolic OH, present. in the tyrosinatc but absent in the acetat,e, roultl add to binding lvith tlirolnhin. To dcci~lc which of these effects w-cre dominant, we synthesized the following p-nitrophcnyl esters: iocloacetate, acetyl- and cbz-glycinate, acetyl-L-leucinate, and cbz-L-phcnylalaninate ant1 studied their rates of hydrolysis with and without' thromI)in at, pH 8."

of nitrophenol production at corresponding initial ester concentrations, LineweaverBurk plots were constructed to estimate the maximal initial velocities obtainable. Since the present work concerns itself only with finding differences in the orders of magnitudes of these maximal velocities, the uncertainties inherent in extrapolating from a limited range become immaterial. In order to be able to measure catalysis with the poorer substrates, the concentration of thrombin had to be varied about loo-fold, and that used in the TAMe assay is taken as unity for comparison. Hydrolysis of LTAMe, a characteristic thrombin substrate (5)) was measured in a pH-stat (kindly constructed by Professor D. D. DeFord) at pH 8.0 and 30", under conditions closely resembling those used with nitrophenyl esters. The 3 ml. reaction mixture contained 1 ml. of 0.3 M CaC12, 0.5 ml. thrombin in 0.2 M KCl, and 3.5 ml. of neutralized N"-ptoeyl-L-arginine methyl ester in water. The experiment was performed in nitrogen atmosphere with 0.01 N NaOH as titrant. The concentration of TAMe varied from 0.66 x 1O-3 to 3.23 x 1O-3 M. Table III presents the data pertaining to the thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of esters.
DISCUSSION

The dat,a on the non-enzymic solvolysis of p-nitrophenyl e&ers, as shown in Table II, permit one to draw some interesting conclusions. As expected, the presence of an

electronegative atom (I or N) , in the alpha position of the ester, labilized the latter bond to basic hydrolysis. p-Nitrophenyl iodoacetate, acet,ylglycinate, and acetyl-Lleucinate illustrate the point. These are about 100 times more labile in the alkaline medium than nitrophenyl acetate. A comparison of the rates of hydrolysis of nitrophenyl acet,ylglycinate and carbobenzoxyglycinat,e shows that> the presence of t,he carbobenzoxy group stabilizes the ester about sevenfold. Indectl, all the substrates containing a carbobenzoxamido group alpha t,o the ester are almost as stable as nitrophenyl acetate itself; this is a most fortunate circumstance for enzymic studies. We infer t'hat the oxycurbonyl function lessens t,he Iabilizing inductive effect of t,he u nitrogen more than a simple carbonyl group does. One could perhaps conjecture that the relative stability of the carbobenzoxyglycinnt,e over aretylglycinntc is attributable to a steric cffcct due to the bulkier subst,itution on t,hc former. The cxccssive lability of nit,rophenyl acet?l-I,-leucinnte, however, appears to make this supposit,ion most unlikely. Vonsitlering t'hcs relative labilitics of subrtratc:: in the enzyme-catalyzed and in the non-cnzymic experiments ilast, columns of Tnblcs II ~~(1 III), t,he difference bct,nccn the two types of reaction is immediately obvious. p-Nitrophenyl iodoacetatc, for example, is exceedingly labile t'owards basic hpdrol;vsis: yet it' is :I very poor substrate

for thrombin. The p-nitrophenyl esters of carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine or carbobenzoxy-L-tyrosine, on the other hand, are among the best (equaling L-TAhJe) in being thrombin substrates, in spite of the fact that their lnbilit,ies in base barely exceed that of p-nitrophenyl acetate. Altogether, it would seem that the presence of a phenyl side cbhninin the acid portion of the ester makes for good substrate quality with regard to the cnzymic reaction. p-Nit,rophenyl carbobenzoxyglycinate and acetyl-L-leucinat'e turned out t,o he cnzynlc~ $ubstr:ltes of interrnediatc quality. \T:e suggest that in these instances, too! the presence of the apolnr side chain in the aubat~rat.e molecules is responsible for the cffc~ct. As stated in t,hc footnote to Table ITT, nit,rophenyl acetylglycinate appears to bc as poor a thrombin substrate as the esters of acetate or iodoacet,nte. Alt,hough direct proof is not yet available, it, seems reasonable to supposc that tile throlnbin-catalyzeti. hydrolysis of esters ljroceeds according t,o tjhe steps demonstratcd for ot'hcr proteolyt,ic enzymes I 6). With t,he clirnination of p-nitrophcnol, an acyltliromt~in intermediate would form which, in turn, reacts with the solvent and reconstitutes the free enzyme. Deacylation of the various acylthrombin intermediates would be expected to occur in the relative order shown in Table II. Iodoacetylt,hrombin, for example, would probably hydrolyze an order of magnitude faster t,han carbobenzoxy-L-pl~enylalanyltl~rornbin. Yet t,he enzpmic turnover of t,hc latter is (Table III) greater than that of the former by a factor of about 300. This large difference is, thus, an expression of the greater affinity of the wrbohenzosy-L-phenylalanyl residue to thrombin as measured against the iodoacet'yl rcsiduc. Tn this respect, the last column in Table III relates to the specificity requircmcnt:: of thrombin.

Since p-toluenesulfonamidobutylguanidine turned out to be a competitive inhibitor of thrombin (7) both with regard to the hydrolysis of L-TAMe and the p-nitrophenyl esters, it can be assumed that, the same "active site" of the enzyme is involved in the reaction with tither type of subst,r:ites. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl-L-tyrosinate has been shown (,I) to be cnt,alyzed not only by thrombin but also by a number of other proteolytic enzymes of apparently unrelated specificities. 11-c are currently engaged in extending the studies reported in the present' paper for trypsin and chymotrylwin, anal our data on hand IRulc, Brnnn~`n,Xteitz :md I,orand, to be published) indicate that the rclatiyc order of substl-ates foun(l w&h thrombin holds also for trypsin ant1 chymotrypsin. It appears thus that tliwcs cnzynrc~s, too, 11yclrolyzP substrates wntaining apolnr side chains better. Finally? we do not as yc>t know whether optical $pccificity around the CL carbon of t,he :mino acid residues in the nit,rophenvl esters l)lnys an important part for enzvrnic hpclrolysi~ to occur. The fact that p-nitrophenyl rarl~obenzoxyglyrinate was found to he a fair subatrat.c for t,hromhin would indicate, howwr, that opt,ical specificity i:: not an overriding recluirenwnt.
