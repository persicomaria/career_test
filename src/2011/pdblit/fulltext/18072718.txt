A novel structural class of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors consisting of substituted 4-(phenylamino)-pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazines has been discovered. An initial subdeck screen revealed that the oxindole-pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine lead 2a displayed potent enzyme inhibition (IC50 60 nM) and was active in a cell-based TNFR biosynthesis inhibition assay (IC50 210 nM). Replacement of the C4 oxindole with 2-methyl-5-N-methoxybenzamide aniline 9 gave a compound with superior p38 kinase inhibition (IC50 10 nM) and moderately improved functional inhibition in THP-1 cells. Further replacement of the C6 ester of the pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine with amides afforded compounds with increased potency, excellent oral bioavailability, and robust efficacy in a murine model of acute inflammation (murine LPS-TNFR). In rodent disease models of chronic inflammation, multiple compounds demonstrated significant inhibition of disease progression leading to the advancement of 2 compounds 11b and 11j into further preclinical and toxicological studies.
Introduction The cytokines TNFR and IL-1 are two of the predominant pro-inflammatory mediators associated with systemic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).1 The use of protein therapeutics which target these cytokines is now the standard of care for the treatment of RA.2 Extension of these therapies into additional indications, such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease, has increased the utility of the biologic approach to inflammatory disease management. However, the limitations of protein based therapies has stimulated significant research aimed at providing small molecule, orally bioavailable, anti-TNFR and anti-IL-1 agents. p38 Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has emerged as an attractive target for chemotherapeutic intervention for the treatment of RA and other inflammatory disorders.3 Activation of p38, a serine threonine kinase consisting of 4 isoforms (R, ,, and ), leads to the up-regulation of both TNFR and IL-1 .4 Additionally, small molecule p38 blockade in humans dosedependently inhibited exogenously induced TNFR production, providing validation of the pathway in humans.5 Expression of the p38 MAPK isoforms varies across cell types of the immune system, and it is believed that the predominant isoform involved in inflammation is p38R.6 Currently, there are several p38R inhibitors undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of RA (Figure 1).7

Figure 1. Examples of p38 MAPK inhibitors that have reached inhuman studies.

We previously reported the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 1,3,5-triaminotriazines (1, Figure 2) as p38R inhibitors.8 Further screening of a focused deck of internal compounds revealed the pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine oxindoles 2a and 2b as potent inhibitors of p38R with enzyme­inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) of 60 and 80 nM, respectively. In a whole cell-based functional assay of lipopolysachharide (LPS) induced TNFR production, both compounds inhibited TNFR biosynthesis (2a, IC50 210 nM; 2b, IC50 570 nM). Substituted phenylaminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazines have previously been used as a template for kinase inhibitor design,9 and it was envisioned that analogs containing the 3-methyl-5benzamido aniline of 1 coupled to a pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine at C4 would provide an alternative class of p38 inhibitors. It is

Figure 3. Proposed binding modes of 3b.

noteworthy that the binding mode of the 1,3,5-triaminotriazine p38R inhibitors has been established via X-ray crystallography (Figure 2, compound 1 detail), revealing a hydrogen bond between Glu71 and the N-alkoxyamide NH (2.4 Å), in addition to a hydrogen bond between the backbone NH of Asp168 and the N-methoxyamide carbonyl (2.2 Å). A similar binding mode for the proposed pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine p38R inhibitors (3a, b) can be envisioned; however, the critical Met109 interaction found in most p38R MAP kinase inhibitors is not obvious. Assuming that the aniline of 3b binds in an identical pocket as 1, two potential Met109 backbone hydrogen bond acceptors can be proposed: the C6 pendant carbonyl oxygen (A, Figure 3) or the pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine core N1 (B, Figure 3). Molecular modeling suggested that both potential binding modes could be accessed with this class of inhibitors. Compounds 3a and 3b were synthesized to test our initial hypothesis and were shown to inhibit p38R kinase with IC50 values of 220 and 1.1 nM, respectively. The more potent 3b blocked LPS induced TNFR production with an IC50 of 160 nM, similar to the potency observed with the oxindole 2a. When dosed orally in BALB/c mice at 30 mg/kg, 3b failed to inhibit serum TNFR production following i.p. LPS administration (data not shown). The C6 ester was presumed to be a liability for in vivo efficacy, as predicted by the high rate of in vitro metabolism,10 and efforts to stabilize this region of the molecule along with structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies aimed at increasing functional activity and oral efficacy were initiated. Results and Discussion Chemistry. Pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine derivatives 3a­f, h, and i were prepared using methods and materials previously described, as shown in Scheme 1.11 Briefly, the 4-chloropyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazines 4, 12, 13a, and 13b were reacted with various anilines to afford the C4 phenylaminopyrrolo[2,1f][1,2,4]triazines (eq a and b). Additional analogs addressing the SAR at C6 were synthesized as outlined in Scheme 1. Amino-pyrrole 6 was synthesized via the electrophilic Namination of pyrrole 5 with either O-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)hydroxylamine (DnpONH2) or monochloramine.12 Cyclization of

6 in refluxing formamide afforded the 3,4-dihydropyrrolo[2,1f][1,2,4]triazine-4-one 7, which was reacted with POCl3 to give 4-chloropyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine 8. Coupling with aniline 9 furnished 3g, which was hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid 10 and converted to the amide analogs 11a­l via standard amide bond forming conditions. A small library of C6-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazines was also prepared from acid 10 as outlined in Scheme 2. Reaction of 10 with diphenyl phosphoryl azide (DPPA) furnished the intermediate acyl azide, which was subjected to direct Curtius rearrangement in the presence of various alcohols to furnish the carbamate analogs 17a­d. The para-methoxybenzyl carbamate 17d was reacted with TFA to furnish the C6 amino analog 14. Further reaction with acid anhydrides or ethyl isocyanate gave the reversed amides 15a­c and urea 16. The synthesis of a related series, in which the C5 carboxamide is converted to a carbamate, is outlined in Scheme 3. Reaction of chloride 8 with 3-nitro-6-methyl aniline gave 18, which was hydrolyzed and coupled with n-propylamine to furnish 19. Compound 19 was reduced to the C5 amine 20 and reacted with chloroformates or acid chlorides to give compounds 21a­f. Alternatively, reaction of 4-chloropyrrolotriazine 12 and ethyl 3-amino-4-methylphenylcarbamate 22 furnished the methyl ester 23. Subsequent hydrolysis afforded 24, which was reacted with various amines to provide the analogs 22g­i. In Vitro Pharmacology and SAR. Subsequent to the discovery of 3b, the synthesized pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine analogs were screened and optimized for inhibition of human p38R MAP kinase. Compounds with significant enzyme inhibition (IC50 < 50 nM) were then evaluated in a cell-based functional assay, where the inhibition of LPS induced TNFR biosynthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was determined. The original C4 phenylaminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine analogs, 3a and 3b, provided the framework for establishing a more potent and orally efficacious series. Table 1 summarizes the C5 SAR at the outset of our effort. Generation of the primary amide 3c resulted in an 80-fold decrease in p38R

inhibition relative to 3b and only a slight increase relative to methyl amide 3a. The C5 ethyl amide 3d had minimal p38R inhibition whereas the N-ethoxyamide 3e was slightly less potent than 3b in both enzyme and cell-based assays. While fixing the C5 substituent as the N-methoxy amide, SAR studies were initiated at C5 and C6 of the pyrrolo[2,1f][1,2,4]triazine core. As shown in Table 2, removal of the C5

methyl group (3f) resulted in a 40-fold decrease in enzyme inhibition with a corresponding loss of functional activity relative to 3b. Interestingly, the C6 ethyl ester 3g was equipotent to 3b in the enzyme inhibition assay and 4.5-fold more potent in the LPS-TNFR cell-based assay. This moderate increase in cellular potency suggested that larger alkyl groups or more lipophilic substitution at C6 leads to compounds with improved

cellular potency. Increasing the size of the C5 substituent (3h, i) resulted in significantly decreased enzyme inhibition.

As stated previously, the lack of in vivo efficacy of 3b was presumed to be due to the presence of the potentially labile C6 methyl ester and it was anticipated that the ethyl ester 3g would encounter a similar fate upon oral dosing. Therefore, a series of C6 amides were prepared. As shown in Table 3, the C6 methyl amide 11a was 20-fold less potent in the p38R enzyme inhibition assay relative to 3b, whereas the ethyl amide 11b (IC50 3.1 nM) had increased p38R inhibition.13 Additionally, 11b was a potent inhibitor of LPS-induced TNFR release in cells (IC50 61 nM). These results parallel the previous observation that increased lipophilicity at C6 increases cellular potency (e.g., 3b to 3g). For example, the propyl and (S)-sec-butyl amides (11c­e) displayed significant p38R enzyme inhibition (IC50 e 10 nM) and in the LPS-TNFR assay, and 11c and

11d were nearly equipotent and comparable in activity to 11b. In the PBMC TNFR assay, 11e was highly potent, (IC50 < 2 nM) and represented the most active compound prepared in this series. Incorporation of an ether linkage in the C6 amide chain (11f) was less tolerated in the functional assay, whereas large alkyl groups (11g), benzyl amides (11h, j, k), and pyridyl amides (11i) were tolerated in both the biochemical and cellular assays. Interestingly, the (R)-R-methylbenzamide, 11k, was shown to be 60-fold less potent in the enzyme inhibition assay and over 200-fold less active in the functional assay relative to the enantiomeric 11j. The ability of p38R kinase to discriminate between enantiomeric pairs of small molecule inhibitors has been well established.14 More importantly, the chiral discrimination has been associated with the orientation of the chiral group proximal to the Met109 binding site. It was therefore proposed that the C4-phenylaminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine based p38R MAP kinase inhibitors were binding to p38R via a hydrogen bond between the C6 amide carbonyl and the backbone NH of Met109 (Figure 3, binding mode A). This binding mode would allow for the positioning of the C6 substituent out to the enzyme protein surface exposed to the solvent (water) interface. As a further test of this binding model, C6 substituents containing a basic, solubilizing group were prepared. As seen with the morpholino ethyl amide 11l, this substitution allows for significant p38R enzyme inhibition (IC50 8 nM) and reasonable functional inhibition in cells (IC50 72 nM). It was anticipated that reversing the C6 carboxamide to the C6 aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazines would provide additional analogs containing a Met109 hydrogen bond acceptor. As shown in Table 4, the C6 reversed amide analogs (15a­c), the urea (16), and the carbamates (17a­c) provided an additional series with p38R enzyme inhibition SAR trends similar to those observed in Table 3. Evaluation of compounds 15a­c in the LPS-TNFR PBMC assay revealed that cellular potency was significantly less than the p38R enzyme inhibition. A more pronounced disconnect between enzyme and functional inhibition was observed for 16, presumably an indication of poor cellular permeability. Analogous to the corresponding amide SAR, the ethyl and isopropyl carbamates 17b and 17c had excellent enzyme inhibition and acceptable functional activity. Having identified the C6 amide as an optimal substituent, C5 reversed amide anilines were investigated. As shown in Table 5, small alkoxy groups (R ) OMe, OEt) inhibited p38R

kinase with moderate inhibition of LPS induced TNFR in PBMCs. Larger C5 substitutions reduced enzyme inhibition (21c, d). Interestingly, the methoxyacetyl analog 21e had moderate activity in both the enzyme and PBMC assays, whereas removal of the chain oxygen (21f) significantly decreased enzyme inhibition. The smaller C5 ethyl carbamate present in 21b was then used to find matched substitutions at C6. As shown in examples 21g­i, significant potency enhancements relative to 21b were not observed. Subsequent to the recognition of the C6 amide carbonyl as the potential Met109 hydrogen bond acceptor, X-ray structures of 11b and 11j bound to unphosphorylated p38R were obtained confirming the proposed binding mode in addition to revealing several key binding interactions (Figure 4). As previously hypothesized, Glu71 and Asp168 form hydrogen bonds with the C5 hydroxamate NH (1.61 Å) and carbonyl (1.77 Å), respectively, with 11j. Additionally, the Asp168 carboxyl group forms a bridging hydrogen bond via water with N3 of the pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine core and Lys53. As suggested by the observed SAR, Met109 forms a hydrogen bond (1.6­1.7 Å) with the pendant C6 amide carbonyl oxygen for both 11b and 11j. Two hydrophobic interactions are also evident from these structures. The C4 aniline occupies the typical hydrophobic pocket accessed by most reported p38R kinase inhibitors and the C6 substituent orients along a hydrophobic surface near the hinge region of the enzyme. Much of the experimentally observed SAR can be rationalized from these structures. Larger C5 substitutions (ethyl, iso-propyl, Table 2, 3g and h) are not allowed due to disfavored steric interactions along the His107-Thr106 region surface. Additionally, the broader array of allowed substitution at C6 is due to the orientation of these substituents relative to the solvent exposed protein surface. Kinase Selectivity Profile for Select Analogs. Advanced compounds (11b­e, j, 21b) were screened against a panel of kinases (e.g., EMT, LCK, Zap70, IKK- 2, HER-1/2, PKA/C, KDR) for potential off target liabilities. The compounds tested exhibited >2000-fold selectivity for p38R against the various kinases tested, whereas these compounds were less selective against p38 (e.g., 11b p38 IC50 15 nM). In a broader selectivity screen encompassing G-protein coupled receptors, ion channels and various transporters, these compounds did not demonstrate any off-target interactions when tested at 10 µM concentrations.

In Vivo Anti-inflammatory Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics. A murine model of acute inflammation (LPS induced serum TNFR production) was used as a primary screen of oral efficacy for advanced compounds with favorable in vitro pharmacological profiles (Table 6). A single 10 mg/kg dose of 11b provided an 80% reduction in circulating TNFR (entry 1). Similarly, 11j provided >90% reduction of TNFR production (entry 2). In a dose response study, 11b demonstrated an ED50 of 0.3­1 mg/kg when dosed 30 min prior to LPS challenge. Extending the dosing interval prior to LPS challenge (2 vs 0.5 h), in addition to reducing the compound dose (2 vs 10 mg/kg) provided a reasonable (61%, entry 3) reduction in serum TNFR levels using 11b. Other analogs were then screened under these conditions. As shown in Table 6, additional C6 amides (entries 4­7) exhibited similar efficacy to 11b. The C6 ethyl carbamate 17b (entry 8) was not efficacious in this model, whereas the C5 ethyl carbamate 21b (entry 9) was highly efficacious. Prior to evaluation in a chronic RA disease model, several C6 amido pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine p38R inhibitors were evaluated in 4 h of oral exposure studies in rats. As shown in Table 7, moderate to high levels of systemic drug exposure was observed for compounds of similar (11b, c) and varying (11d­11j) C6 substitution. A partial explanation for the reduced exposure at 0.5 h of 11b is the lower intrinsic permeability of 11b relative to other compounds as measured in a Caco-2 permeability assay (20 nm/s for 11b vs 58 nm/s for 11c and 131 nm/s for 11j). The C5 carbamate 21b had reduced drug exposure relative to the C6 amide analogs and was not evaluated further. Incubation of several analogs in rat and human liver microsomes indicated that low (rat) to moderate (human) levels of parent drug would be metabolized in the liver. The rat adjuvant induced arthritis (RAA) disease model was then incorporated into the compound efficacy evaluation paradigm. Accordingly, compounds were evaluated at 10 mg/kg, bid, in this disease model (Figure 5). Interestingly, compounds

11b, c, d, and j inhibited disease progression equally in this model and the statistical significance between compounds was not observed. Compounds 11e and 11i were not efficacious in this model. Subsequently, a discrete pharmacokinetic analysis in mice of 11b, 11c, and 11j was performed in an effort to further differentiate these advanced compounds and as a precursor to chronic studies in mice (Table 8). All compounds had good to excellent oral bioavailability and drug exposure over the time course of the study. Moderate to high clearance was observed for all compounds tested. C6 amido pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine analogs 11b, 11c, and 11j were then evaluated in the mouse collagen induced arthritis (mCIA) disease model. As can be seen in Figure 6, 11b provided significant reduction in the measured outcome of disease progression relative to the vehicle group when dosed orally at 3 mg/kg, bid (49% reduction). Compound 11c demonstrated reduced efficacy relative to 11b in the mouse CIA model at an

Conclusions A focused screening effort identified the oxindole-pyrrolo[2,1f][1,2,4]triazines (2a, b) as novel p38 MAPK inhibitors. Replacement of the C4 oxindole with a substituted aniline yielded potent p38R inhibitors. The C5 alkoxy amide substitution was found to be important for achieving significant enzyme inhibition and whole cell functional activity. SAR studies at C6swhich included a survey of amide-, reversed amide-, urea-, and carbamate-linked pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazinessled to compounds with oral efficacy in multiple rodent models of inflammation. The combined in vitro pharmacology, in vivo efficacy, and suitable pharmacokinetics of 11b and 11j resulted in the selection of both compounds for advanced preclinical studies in higher species. As will be described separately,15 the results of these studies prompted the nomination of amide 11b as a candidate for clinical development. Experimental Section

Methyl 4-(2-methyl-5-(methylcarbamoyl)phenylamino)-5-methylpyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine-6-carboxylate (3a). Representative Procedure for the Preparation of an m-Amino-N-substituted Benzamide Intermediate and Subsequent Coupling To Methyl 4-Chloro-5-methylpyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine-6-carboxylate. To a solution of 3-nitro-4-methyl benzoyl chloride (19.9 g, 100 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (115 mL) at 0 °C was added methylamine (100 mmol, 100 mL, 2 M in THF), and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. Stirring was continued for 1 h, and then, a second aliquot of methylamine was added (20 mL, 20 mmol) and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight. The volatile solvents were removed on a rotovap, and the residue was suspended in ethanol (100 mL) and treated with NaOH (0.1 N, 200 mL) to quench the remaining acid halide. The reaction mixture was neutralized with 1 N HCl, and the volatile solvents were removed on a rotovap. Additional water (200 mL) was added, and the resulting solids were stirred rapidly for 2 h and then filtered and rinsed with water to give methyl 3-nitro-4-methyl benzamide (17.2 g, 89% yield). To a solution of methyl 3-nitro-4-methyl benzamide (6.0 g, 30.9 mmol) in EtOH (150 mL) was added 10% Pd-C (380 mg, wet), and the reaction placed under a H2 atmosphere (43 psi) on a Parr shaker for 3 h. The reaction solution was filtered through celite. This step was repeated on an additional 6 g, and the filtrates were combined and concentrated in vacuo. EtOH (150 mL) was added to slurry the solids, and concentrated HCl (5.4 mL, 65 mmol) was added dropwise; the slurry was then stirred overnight. The slurry was then cooled to 5 °C, and the solids were collected by filtration to give methyl 3-amino-4-methyl benzamide hydrochloride (9.52 g, 77% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6)  9.89 (br s, 2H), 8.40 (s, 1H), 7.68 (s, 1H), 7.55 (d, J ) 7.7 Hz, 1H), 7.23 (d, J ) 7.8 Hz, 1H), 2.64 (d, J) 4.4 Hz, 3H), 2.25 (s, 3H); Anal.

The resulting mixture was cooled to rt, and the solvent was removed on a rotary evaporator. The resulting solids were triturated with hexanes and dried in vacuo to afford 151 g (91%) of the crude BOC-protected aniline as a light pink solid. To the above solid was added EDC (127 g, 0.66 mol), HOBt (90 g, 0.66 mol), and DMF (1000 mL), and the resulting mixture was stirred at rt for 30 min followed by addition of methoxyamine hydrochloride (55 g, 0.66 mol). After stirring for 10 min, the mixture was cooled using an ice bath. DIPEA (250 mL, 1.4 mol) was added at such a rate so as to maintain the internal reaction temperature below 25 °C. After the addition was complete, the ice bath was removed and the reaction was stirred overnight at rt. The reaction mixture was partitioned between 0.5 L of water and 1.5 L of EtOAc, and the resulting layers were separated.

which was from three 20-µL additions of enzyme, substrates (myelin basic protein (MBP) and ATP), and test compounds in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM DTT). Bacterially expressed, activated p38R was preincubated with test compounds for 10 min prior to the initiation of reaction by adding substrates. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 45 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 5 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to each well. The reaction mixture was aspirated onto a prewetted filtermat using a Skatron Micro96 cell harvester (Skatron) and then washed with PBS. The filtermat was dried in a microwave oven for 1 min, coated with a layer of MeltilLex A scintillation wax (PerkinElmer), and counted on a Microbeta scintillation counter (Model 1450, PerkinElmer). The data were analyzed using Prizm nonlinear least-squares regression (GraphPad Software). The final concentrations of reagents in the assays were [ATP], 1 µM; [[-33P]ATP]], 3 nM; [MBP] (Sigma, M1891), 2 µg/well; [p38], 15 ng/well; [DMSO], 0.3%. LPS-Induced TNFr Production in THP-1 Cells. Human monocytic THP-1 cells, obtained from ATCC, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (40 000 cells in 80 µL) were added to wells of 96-well flatbottomed plates. Tested compounds (10 µL) or vehicle (1% DMSO final) was added to cells. Subsequently, LPS (Sigma, No. L7261; 10 µL /well) was added to the cells for a final concentration of 1 µg/mL. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Supernatant (50 µL/well) was harvested for an ELISA assay. TNFR was captured by an antihuman TNFR antibody (R&D, No. MAB610) which was preabsorbed in high binding EIA plates (Costar, No. 3590). Captured TNF was recognized by a biotinylated antihuman TNF polyclonal antibody (R&D, No. BAF210). Streptavidin conjugated with peroxidase was added to each well, and the activity of peroxidase was quantitated by a peroxide substrate kit (Pierce, Nos. 34062 and 34006). LPS-Induced TNFr Production in Human PBMC. Human PBMCs were isolated from whole blood collected from healthy donors. Blood was diluted into RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing 2.5 mM EDTA (Life Technologies) and 10 µg/mL polymyxin (Sigma) and, then, underlaid with ficoll (Accurate Scientific Co.) and centrifuged at 600g for 25 min. The interface was collected, and cells were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI, 10% FBS. Cells were then distributed (200 µL/well) into 96-well tissue culture treated plates (Falcon) at 1 × 106 cells/mL in RPMI, 10% FBS. Test compounds were added to appropriate wells and incubated with cells for 30 min. Cells were then stimulated by the addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, BioWhittaker), with a final concentration of 25 ng/mL, and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The cell supernatants were removed and assayed for TNFR by ELISA (R&D Systems). Inhibition of TNFr Release in Mice. BALB\c female mice, 6­8 weeks of age, were obtained from Harlan Laboratories and maintained ad libitum on water and standard rodent chow (Harlan Teklad). Mice were acclimated to ambient conditions for at least 1 week prior to use. For oral dosing, the compounds were prepared in a solution of 100% polyethylene glycol (MW 300), and a dosing volume of 0.2 mL per mouse was administered by gavage 30 or 120 min prior to LPS injection (0.1 mL of LPS suspended at 10 µg/mL in PBS, administered ip). Blood samples were obtained 90 min after LPS injection. Serum was separated from clotted blood samples by centrifugation (5 min, 5000g, room temperature) and analyzed for levels of TNFR by ELISA assay (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's directions. Results are shown as mean percent inhibition of n ) 6­8 mice per treatment group. All studies were performed using 11b as a positive control and as a measure of model variability. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat and Human Liver Microsome Stability. Rat microsomes were purchased from XenoTech (Kansas City, KS). The human microsomes were purchased from In Vitro Technology (Baltimore, MD) and were pooled from 10 individual donors. The rates of oxidative metabolism were measured in triplicate under the fol-

lowing conditions: compound, 3 µM final concentration; final microsomal protein concentration approximately 1 mg/mL; NADPH 1 mM; pH 7.4 potassium phosphate buffer, 56 mM. Incubations were performed at 37 °C and were initiated by the addition of the substrate. Aliquots (100 µL) of the incubation were quenched at 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min by the addition of 1 volume of acetonitrile. Results from 10-min incubations were used for the rate calculations. Samples were analyzed by the LC/MS/MS assay for the amount of the drug remaining at any time point. The percent metabolized was calculated based on the disappearance of the parent compound. Rat Adjuvant Arthritis. Male Lewis rats (Harlan, 175­200 g) were immunized sc at the base of the tail with 0.1 mL complete Freund's adjuvant containing 10 mg/mL Mycobacterium butyricum. Seven days later, baseline (predisease) measurements of hind paw volume were determined by volume displacement plethysmometry (Ugo Basile, Italy). Compound was administered orally in 1 mL PEG 300 bid beginning on day 11. Paw volume measurements were repeated 3 times/week for the remainder of the study. Data are presented as the summed increase in volume (expressed in mL) above baseline for each rat's two hind paws. Dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Mouse Collagen Induced Arthritis. DBA/1LacJ male mice 6­8 weeks (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were immunized subcutaneously on day 0 and day 21 with 200 µg bovine type II collagen in a 0.1 mL RIBI adjuvant system (RAS) with monophosphoryl lipid A (RIBI ImmunoChem Research, Hamilton, Montana). Following the day 21 booster, mice were monitored daily for the development paw inflammation. On day 26, the animals were randomly assigned to a treatment group and treatment (po, bid) was initiated immediately. Clinical paw scores for all four paws were summed for each mouse and mean ( SD was calculated for each treatment group. Dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Clinical Scoring. Each paw was visually scored by the following criteria: 0 ) normal; 1 ) one (or more) joints inflamed on digits; 2 ) inflammation of plantar surface of paw and paw thickness increased; 3 ) ankylosis of ankle joint (significantly reduced hock joint motion on flexion/extension). Crystal Structure of p38 MAP Kinase. Recombinant p38R MAP Kinase with an N-terminal (His)5-affinity tag was expressed in E. coli and purified by sequential Q-Sepharose FF, His-Trap HP Ni2+-affinity, and Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography. Purified (His)5-p38R, at 2 mg/mL in 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, was combined with a 5-fold molar excess of inhibitor from a 50 mM stock in DMSO, incubated at 20 °C for 1 h, and ultrafiltered (10 kDa cutoff) to a retentate protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. Cocrystals of (His)5-p38R 11j inhibitor complexes grew spontaneously in hanging drop vapor-diffusion trials conducted at 4 °C with drops containing 1 µL of concentrated protein-inhibitor complex mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution (50 mM Mes pH 6.0, 4% PEG 3350, 5 mM MgSO4). More perfect crystals of 11j and 11b were obtained using a cat whisker to streak clear drops with microseeds from crushed cocrystals of (His)5-p38R and 11j. Prior to data collection, the crystals were slowly transferred to a stabilization solution (5% glycerol, 30% PEG 3350, 50 mM Mes pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl) and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the IMCA-CAT beamline ID-17 at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL, reduced with the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK,19 and refined by with the program autoBuster (Global Phasing, Ltd., Cambridge, U.K.). The final crystallographic refinement statistics are summarized in the Supporting Information. Details of the data collection, reduction, and refinement will be presented elsewhere.20
