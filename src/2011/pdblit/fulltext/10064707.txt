Immunoglobulin A (IgA), the most abundant human immunoglobulin, mediates immune protection at mucosal surfaces as well as in plasma. It exists as two subclasses IgA1 and IgA2, and IgA2 is found in at least two allotypic forms, IgA2m(1) or IgA2m(2). Compared to IgA1, IgA2 has a much shorter hinge region, which joins the two Fab and one Fc fragments. In order to assess its solution structure, monomeric recombinant IgA2m(1) was studied by X-ray and neutron scattering. Its Guinier X-ray radius of gyration RG is 5.18 nm and its neutron RG is 5.03 nm, both of which are significantly smaller than those for monomeric IgA1 at 6.1 ­6.2 nm. The distance distribution function PðrÞ for IgA2m(1) showed a broad peak with a subpeak and gave a maximum dimension of 17 nm, in contrast to the PðrÞ curve for IgA1, which showed two distinct peaks and a maximum dimension of 21 nm. The sedimentation coefficients of IgA1 and IgA2m(1) were 6.2 S and 6.4 S, respectively. These data show that the solution structure of IgA2m(1) is significantly more compact than IgA1. The complete monomeric IgA2m(1) structure was modelled using molecular dynamics to generate random IgA2 hinge structures, to which homology models for the Fab and Fc fragments were connected to generate 10,000 full models. A total of 104 compact best-fit IgA2m(1) models gave good curve fits. These best-fit models were modified by linking the two Fab light chains with a disulphide bridge that is found in IgA2m(1), and subjecting these to energy refinement to optimise this linkage. The averaged solution structure of the arrangement of the Fab and Fc fragments in IgA2m(1) was found to be predominantly T-shaped and flexible, but also included Y-shaped structures. The IgA2 models show full steric access to the two FcaRI-binding sites at the Ca2 ­ Ca3 interdomain region in the Fc fragment. Since previous scattering modelling had shown that IgA1 also possessed a flexible T-shaped solution structure, such a T-shape may be common to both IgA1 and IgA2. The final models suggest that the combination of the more compact IgA2m(1) and the more extended IgA1 structures will enable human IgA to access a broader range of antigens than either acting alone. The hinges of both IgA subclasses appear to

Introduction
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant human immunoglobulin class found on mucosal surfaces and is the second most abundant in plasma.1,2 The mucosal surfaces that secrete IgA are major potential sites of pathogenic invasion because of their large surface areas. IgA1 and IgA2, the two subclasses of IgA, can exist in different polymerisation states. Serum IgA is mainly monomeric, and 90% of this is IgA1. Secretory IgA is predominantly dimeric with some higher oligomers, and IgA1 and IgA2 are found in similar amounts. IgA dimerisation involves the formation of disulphide bridges between two IgA monomers and a 15 kDa J chain. Secretory IgA is formed when dimeric IgA binds to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells lining mucosal sites. The transcytosis of this complex across the cell and proteolysis of the receptor results in the formation of secretory IgA, in which the major receptor fragment is called secretory component and this is disulphide bridged with dimeric IgA. Secretory IgA serves as the first line of defence against invading pathogenic microorganisms, preventing their entry into the body.3,4 Important effector functions of serum IgA are mediated by binding to the cell surface Fca receptor (FcaRI; CD89), which binds to serum and secretory IgA of both subclasses to trigger clearance mechanisms.2,5,6 Serum IgA appears to function as a second line of defence in order to eliminate pathogens that have penetrated the mucosal surface.7 Interestingly, homologues of human IgA1 are found only in some higher apes, while human IgA2 can be considered to be more similar to the IgA found in all other species.8,9 The monomeric form of both IgA subclasses have a 12-domain structure that is composed of two light and two heavy chains (Figure 1). The light chain contains a V-type and a C1-type immunoglobulin domain (VL and CL). The heavy chain contains a V-type and three C1-type domains (VH, CH1, CH2 and CH3). An 18 residue tailpiece peptide is attached to the C terminus of the CH3 domains with an N-linked glycosylation site.10 IgA1 contains a 23 residue hinge between Cys220 in the CH1 domain and Pro244 in the CH2 domain with up to five O-linked glycosylation sites, whilst in IgA2 there are only ten residues between Cys220 and Pro244 and no O-glycosylation sites (the residue numbering for IgA2 follows that in our previous modelling study of IgA110). IgA2 exists as one of the two allotypes, IgA2m(1) and

IgA2m(2), with a third form IgA2(n) possibly representing another allotype.11 In distinction to IgA1, all three IgA2 variants contain two additional N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn166 and Asn337 in the CH1 and the CH2 domains, respectively (Figure 1). The IgA2m(2) and IgA2(n) variants also contain a fifth N-linked glycosylation site at Asn211 in the CH1 domain. The N-linked sugar moieties of IgA exhibit a marked degree of compositional heterogeneity.12,13 The different hinge regions of IgA1 and IgA2 account for their different susceptibilities to IgA1 proteinases secreted by many important mucosal pathogens.14,15 IgA1 but not IgA2 is reported to bind to the transferrin receptor (CD71) with a binding profile reminiscent of that of a human T-cell receptor that recognises only IgA1 O-linked sugar moieties.16,17 Also, the mouse epithelial M-cell receptor binds human IgA2 but not IgA1.18 Until now, structural studies on IgA have not resulted in a full structural model for IgA2m(1). The crystal structure of the Fab fragment from murine IgA J539 confirmed the expected b-sheet structures in the V and C domains.19 The human IgA1 Fc crystal structure was published20 after we had first presented our modelling study of IgA2m(1),21 and resembles those determined for IgG Fc and IgE Fc.22 ­ 25 Crystal structures for intact human IgG1 and mouse IgG1 and IgG2a provided single snapshot views of asymmetric T-shaped and Y-shaped structures, showing that the IgG hinge exists in multiple conformations.24,25 Several electron microscopy studies of IgA1 dimers revealed double Y-shaped structures with variable inter-Fab fragment angles and extended hinges.26 Electron microscopy studies of IgA2 monomers suggested that these were more rigidly-hinged.27 Scattering and constrained modelling of human IgA1 showed that the hinges were extended and gave flexible T-shaped structures in solution.10 Averaged solution scattering structures have been likewise determined for bovine IgG1/2 and a mouse IgG1 chimeric antibody.28 ­ 30 Here, we have investigated the solution structure of monomeric IgA2 for comparison with IgA1 and IgG. We present X-ray and neutron-scattering data on IgA2m(1), compare these with those for IgA1,10 and supplement these by analytical ultracentrifugation data on both IgA2m(1) and IgA1. We show that IgA2m(1) is significantly more compact

Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the Ig fold domains in human IgA1 and IgA2m(1). Each heavy chain contains the VH, CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains, and each light chain contains the VL and CL domains. The four-domain Fab fragments are linked to the four-domain Fc fragment by a 23 residue hinge in IgA1 and by a ten residue hinge in IgA2m(1). Each IgA heavy chain contains an 18 residue tailpiece at the C terminus. Each Ig fold has a conserved internal Cys ­Cys disulphide bridge (S ­ S). Unlike IgA1, the two light chains of IgA2m(1) are linked by their C-terminal Cys214 residues. Both IgA molecules have several inter-heavy chain disulphide bridges. In IgA2m(1), Cys311 on the CH2 domain and Cys471 in the tailpiece are shown free. IgA2m(1) has one N-linked oligosaccharide site at Asn166 on b-strand G of the CH1 domain, two sites at Asn263 on b-strand B and Asn337 on b-strand G of the CH2 domain, and one site at Asn459 on the tailpiece (X). IgA1 has up to five O-linked oligosaccharide sites in the hinge (W) that are not present in IgA2m(1), and two fewer N-linked oligosaccharide sites than in IgA2m(1).

than IgA1, its solution structure is T-shaped with possible contributions of Y-shapes, and both subclasses show reduced hinge flexibilities when compared to IgG, and discuss the functional implications of these results. We also discuss the functional implications of these results in terms of IgA polymerisation and the recent crystal structure for the IgA1 Fc fragment.20

Results and Discussion
X-ray and neutron Guinier analyses of monomeric IgA2m(1) The solution arrangement of the Fab and Fc fragments of IgA2m(1) was first analysed using synchrotron X-ray scattering data IðQÞ. Recombinant IgA2m(1) was used rather than serum IgA2 in order to enable the study of a pure monoclonal antibody in adequate quantities with a known antigenic specificity against the hapten NIP.31 This IgA2 was a chimeric molecule composed of a heavy chain comprising the human a-chain CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains and a murine VH domain,

combined with a murine l light chain with VL and CL domains (Figure 1). IgA2m(1) was studied at concentrations between 0.42 mg/ml and 1.12 mg/ml at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (SRS) and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Time-frame analyses showed that the X-ray Guinier analyses for the SRS and ESRF data for IgA2m(1) were not completely resistant to X-rayinduced aggregation, as also observed for the Fc fragment of IgE,32 but not for intact IgA1.10 This aggregation was circumvented by calculating RG values from the first time-frame only for the SRS and ESRF data. At the lowest Q values, Guinier analyses resulted in linear plots in three distinct regions of the IðQÞ curves from which the RG ; RXS-1 and RXS-2 values were obtained within satisfactory QRG and QRXS limits (Figure 2). IgA2m(1) exhibited an X-ray RG value of 5.17(^ 0.11) nm and 5.18(^ 0.09) nm from the SRS and ESRF data analyses, respectively (Table 1). The anisotropy ratio RG =RO (where RO is the RG value of the sphere with the same volume as the hydrated glycoprotein) was calculated from the X-ray RG value of IgA2m(1) to be 1.66. Comparison of this ratio to that of 1.99 determined for serum IgA110

The filled circles between the arrowed QRG and QRXS ranges show the data points used to determine RG ; RXS-1 and RXS-2 values. The X-ray Q range used for the RG values was 0.16­ 0.29 nm21 for the SRS data, and 0.12­ 0.29 nm21 for the ESRF data, and those for the RXS-1 and RXS-2 values were 0.33 ­ 0.51 nm21 and 0.63 ­ 1.04 nm21, respectively, for both the SRS and ESRF data. The neutron Q range used for the RG data was 0.13 ­ 0.27 nm21, and those for the RXS-1 and RXS-2 data were 0.32­ 0.55 nm21 and 0.65 ­1.04 nm21, respectively.

showed that IgA2m(1) is less elongated than IgA1 in solution. The X-ray cross-sectional Guinier analyses lead to a length determination L for IgA2m(1). From the SRS data, the RXS-1 value was 2.39(^ 0.10) nm, whilst the RXS-2 value was 1.37(^ 0.16) nm. From value was the ESRF data, the RXS-1 2.47(^ 0.09) nm, whilst the RXS-2 value was 1.47(^ 0.08) nm. The combination of the RG and RXS-1 values resulted in an overall length L for IgA2m(1) of 16.0 nm from both the SRS and ESRF data (Table 1), which is less than that of 20.1 nm for IgA1. IgA2m(1) contains 11% (w/w) carbohydrate at eight sites (Figure 1). Carbohydrate has a higher scattering density than protein.33 In order to confirm both the absence of aggregation in the final X-ray curves, and possible contrastdependence effects from carbohydrate, neutron

scattering data was obtained for IgA2m(1) in 100% 2 H2O buffers, which corresponds to a high negative protein­ solvent scattering contrast. Neutronscattering also provided complementary data on the hydration shell surrounding IgA2m(1), which is invisible by neutrons but not by X-rays.34 Neutron data were collected at 2.0 mg/ml and 3.0 mg/ml at ISIS. The similarity of the neutron RG value of 5.03(^ 0.01) nm to the X-ray value (Table 1) confirmed that IgA2m(1) was stable during the first time-frame of X-ray irradiation. The slight decrease observed in the neutron RG value when compared to the X-ray value is attributed to the invisible hydration shell.34 The neutron Guinier Ið0Þ=c value was determined to be 0.14 ^ 0.02 for IgA2m(1). The linear relationship between protein Ið0Þ=c values measured in 2H2O buffers and normalised against a standard deuterated polymer and the protein molecular mass M

for LOQ ðM ¼ Ið0Þ=c £ 9 £ 105 Þ resulted in an estimated M value of 130,000 for IgA2m(1).10 This measurement is less than but within the precision of the composition-derived value of 163,000 for IgA2m(1), showing that this was monomeric in solution. The neutron length determination L of IgA2m(1) agreed with the X-ray data. The neutron RXS-1 value was 2.21(^ 0.10) nm, and the neutron RXS-2 value was 1.04(^ 0.06) nm. As also observed for IgA1,13 the neutron RXS values for IgA2m(1) were significantly less than their X-ray values. This is attributed to the hydration shell effect. The value of L calculated from the RG and the RXS-1 values is 15.5 nm, which is within 0.5 nm of the X-ray value above, and is significantly less than the neutron L value of 19.8 nm for IgA1. X-ray and neutron distance distribution analyses P(r) Transformation of the observed curve IðQÞ into the distance distribution function PðrÞ provided real space information on the IgA2m(1) structure. The maximum M in these curves corresponds to the most frequently occurring interatomic distance within the structure. The neutron and X-ray PðrÞ curves for IgA2m(1) in Figure 3 showed a single peak. This was located at r ¼ 4:5 nm (neutrons: Figure 3(a)), 5.1(^ 0.9) nm (SRS X-rays) and 4.5(^ 0.3) nm (ESRF X-rays: Figure 3(b)). In the latter, a marked inflexion could be observed at r ¼ 6:8ð^0:7Þ nm as the result of the higher instru-

mental quality of this data (Figure 3(b)). The RG values determined from the PðrÞ curves were 5.08(^ 0.09) nm (SRS: ten curves), 5.21(^ 0.15) nm (ESRF, seven curves) and 5.12(^ 0.01) nm (ISIS, two curves), all of which agreed with the Guinier analyses (Table 1). The neutron and X-ray lengths L of IgA2m(1) were determined as 17.0 nm from the PðrÞ curves where these intersect PðrÞ ¼ 0; this being within 1.0­ 1.5 nm of the Guinier values (Table 1). The observation of a single peak at 4.5 nm and a subpeak at 6.8 nm in the X-ray PðrÞ curve of IgA2m(1) (Figure 3(b)) instead of the separate two peaks observed for PTerm455 and IgA1 at r ¼ 3:7 ­ 4:0 nm and r ¼ 8:7 ­ 9:1 nm (Figure 3(c) and (d)) shows that IgA2m(1) adopts a more compact shape than IgA1.10 The IgA1 peak M1 at r ¼ 3:7 nm can be assigned to the most commonly occurring distance in a single Fab or Fc fragment, given that each is approximately 8 nm long. As M2 is about half the overall length L for both IgA2m(1) and IgA1, this is assigned to the most common distance within the whole IgA structure. The existence of the M2 peak indicates that the Fab and Fc fragments are held apart in a relatively inflexible fashion as distinct structural entities by their hinge peptides. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses of monomeric IgA2m(1) The molecular mass for the recombinant IgA2m(1) chimera was determined by sedimentation

equilibrium experiments at concentrations between 0.13 mg/ml and 1.11 mg/ml (see Materials and Methods). Using both absorbance data monitored at 280 nm and interference data, the molecular mass of IgA2m(1) was determined from the data measured at three rotor speeds assuming that a single species was present (Figure 4). A slight concentration dependence in the molecular mass for IgA2m(1) was observed. Its molecular mass was determined as 161,000(^ 6000) Da (interference) and 149,000(^ 7000) Da (absorbance) at zero concentration. As these are within error of the molecular mass of 163,000 Da calculated from its sequence, IgA2m(1) was confirmed to be a monomer in solution. The sedimentation coefficient s0 20;w monitors the

extent of macromolecular elongation, being independent of the RG measurements. Velocity experiments with IgA2m(1) were performed at six rotor speeds at concentrations between 0.28 mg/ml and 1.12 mg/ml (see Materials and Methods). Time-derivative analysis using the gðsp Þ method gave a mean s0 20;w value of 6.42(^ 0.1) S from the peak position in Figure 5(a). The width of this peak leads to the diffusion coefficient. Hence, the molecular mass was determined from the Svedberg equation to be 147,000 under conditions in which time-broadening effects were negligible. To eliminate systematic errors due to diffusion-broadening, direct boundary fitting of the raw sedimentation scans was performed (Figure 5(c)). This gave a mean s0 20;w value of 6.57(^ 0.1) S, which is slightly larger but within

Regressions to zero concentrations of each set of 15 data points gave molecular mass values of 161,000(^ 6000) Da and 149,000(^7000) Da, respectively.

In (a), the IgA2m(1) fit as shown was based on ten scans recorded at 20,000 rpm at eight minutes intervals using absorbance optics at 280 nm at a sample concentration of 0.28 mg/ml in PBS. From this analysis, s0 20;w was determined to be 6.42 S, and the molecular mass was estimated to be 147,000(^ 25,000) Da. In (b), the serum IgA1 fit as shown was based on 12 scans recorded at 20,000 rpm at a sample concentration of 1.12 mg/ml, yielding an s0 20;w value of 6.25 S in this case. (c) Fit of the 120 raw sedimentation scans for IgA2m(1) at 25,000 rpm based on the SEDFIT program. For clarity, only the fit at every fifth scan during the first 70 scans is shown. This analysis resulted in an s0 value of 6.48 S. 20;w

error of the gðsp Þ analysis. The slight increase is as expected if diffusion had affected the gðsp Þ analyses. The s0 20;w value of IgA1 was also determined. This was 6.20(^ 0.2) S for human myeloma IgA1 between 0.70 mg/ml and 1.61 mg/ml, and 6.15(^ 0.1) S for human serum IgA1 between 0.7 mg/ml and 1.5 mg/ml (Figure 5). Direct boundary fitting gave 6.33(^ 0.1) S (not shown). These values agree well with those of 6.2 S for myeloma IgA1 Hui and 6.3 S for serum IgA1 measured on a Beckman model E26 and are smaller than a value of 6.56 S for a human myeloma IgA1 protein.35 The slightly smaller s0 20;w value for IgA1 compared to IgA2m(1) might reflect their molecular masses of 160,000 Da and 163,000 Da, respectively derived from their compositions.

However, unlike the RG =RO anisotropy ratios, which indicated a clear difference between IgA1 and IgA2m(1), the frictional coefficient ratios for IgA1 and IgA2m(1) were almost identical at 1.56 and 1.53, respectively. This outcome suggested that either IgA1 or IgA2m(1) or both possess unusual hydrodynamic properties. Molecular dynamics search for an IgA2m(1) scattering structure The constrained modelling analysis of IgA2m(1) differs from that for bovine IgG1 and IgG2, human IgA1 and murine Crry-Ig,10,28,29 for reason of the unique short hinge in IgA2m(1). Its structure is also influenced by a disulphide bridge frequently found between the C termini of the two

light chains31,36,37 (Figure 1). Initially, this disulphide bridge was disregarded. IgA2m(1) models were first created with their Fab and Fc fragments in a wide unrestrained range of conformations (see Materials and Methods). Molecular dynamics simulations generated 10,000 random hinge conformations starting from an extended conformation of length 3.54 nm for the ten residue hinge peptide 221-PVPPPPPCCH-243 (Figure 6). Homology models for the Fab and Fc fragments of human IgA2 were created from those used for IgA1.10 Finally, the Fab and Fc fragments were connected by two identical hinges to give a 2-fold symmetric model for IgA2m(1). Figure 7(a) showed that the simulations had sampled the three-dimensional space between the Fab and Fc fragments in sufficient detail to enable any model compatible with the scattering data to be identified. Filters based on the X-ray and neutron-scattering data were now used to reject unsatisfactory models. The following results were obtained. (1) The 5% filter for steric overlap eliminated the IgA2m(1) models in which the Fab and Fc fragments were sterically overlapped. The hydrated X-ray models needed at least 1800 ^ 90 spheres, while the dry neutron models needed at least 1362 ^ 68 spheres. These over-

lapping models correspond to the white circles at the bottom of the distribution in Figure 7(a). Only 2498 models (yellow circles) of the 10,000 models passed this filter, and they corresponded to only the longer Fab ­ Fab distances and Fab ­ Fc distances. (2) The ^ 5% filter for the X-ray RG value of 5.18 nm and the ^ 10% filter for the X-ray RXS-1 value of 2.47 nm (bottom of Table 2) together with the steric overlap filter gave 197 satisfactory hydrated models (green circles in Figure 7(b)). These corresponded to the more extended models with larger RG values, for which the hinge length ranged between 1.2 nm and 3.2 nm. (3) The same filters for the neutron RG value of 5.03 nm and RXS-1 value of 2.21 nm (bottom of Table 2) together with the steric overlap filter gave 318 satisfactory dry models (green circles in Figure 7(c)). This distribution is similar to that obtained from the X-ray data. These models corresponded to hinge lengths between 1.3 nm and 3.5 nm. The combination of the filters in Figure 7(b) and (c) resulted in the 104 best-fit structures shown in Figure 7(a). (4) The 10,000 models were sorted against the goodness-of-fit X-ray and neutron R-factors in Figure 7(d) and (e), respectively. The 104 best-fit structures of Figure 7(a) (green circles) mostly corresponded to the lowest R-factors. The 104

(b) and (c) The X-ray and neutron radii of gyration RG of the 10,000 models is shown as a function of hinge length for the hydrated and dry models, where the target experimental RG values are 5.18 nm for hydrated IgA2m(1) (X-ray models) and 5.03 nm for dry IgA2m(1) (neutron models). The maximum length of the ten residue hinge is 3.54 nm. (d) and (e) The X-ray and neutron R-factors of the 10,000 models is shown as a function of hinge length.

neutron R-factors ranged between 4.4% and 5.8%, while some small spread between 6.5% and 12.5% was observed in the X-ray R-factors (last column of Table 2). Molecular views of the superimposed 104 best-fit structures are shown in Figure 8. Refinement of a best-fit IgA2m(1) structure The IgA2m(1) modelling was completed by connecting the Cys214 ­ Cys214 inter-light chain

disulphide bridge. In the 10,000 starting models, the a-carbon separations between the two Cys214 residues ranged between 0.1 nm and 9.1 nm. Initially, a selection of 50 best-fit models was made by filtering the 10,000 models for the X-ray R-factors calculated using data from the SRS, Daresbury. These 50 best-fit models were submitted to Crystallography and NMR System (CNS) energy minimisation to form the disulphide bridges (see Materials and Methods). This process resulted in the loss of about 75% of the models, either because 2-fold symmetry was lost, the

inter-light chain disulphide was formed inside the Fc fragment, or the curve-fit deteriorated because the Fab and Fc fragments had moved too much. Comparison of the 50 models with the 104 best-fit structures from Figure 7(a) showed that 15 of these occurred in both sets of models (Table 2). The Cys214 ­ Cys214 a-carbon separations in these 15 models ranged between 2.3 nm and 6.6 nm prior to the connection of the disulphide bridge (optimally this separation should be 0.6 nm). One of these 15 models was superior to the remainder when they were ranked in order of their ESRF X-ray R-factors (red circle in Figure 7). This model had a pre-CNS refinement Cys214 a-carbon separation of 2.7 nm, an X-ray R-factor of 7.6% and a neutron R-factor of 4.8%. After CNS refinement, the X-ray and neutron scattering curve fits showed good visual agreements in a large Q range, with only a slightly worsened X-ray R-factor

of 7.9% and a slightly worsened neutron R-factor of 5.3% (Figure 9). Another of these 15 models with a pre-refinement Cys214 ­ Cys214 a-carbon separation of 3.5 nm has been published elsewhere.21 Two control calculations completed the analyses. (1) A human IgA2m(1) model with a k class light chain (Figure 6(a)) had been used for the modelling of IgA2m(1), which contained a human ­ mouse chimeric sequence with a l class light chain. A CLUSTAL analysis showed that only five small insertions were needed to align the k and l light chains (dashes in Figure 6(a)). The crystal structure of the murine N1G9 Fab fragment (PDB code 1ngq24) comprises an appropriate set of VH ; CH1, VL and CL domains for remodelling. Its CH1 domain was superimposed with that in the human IgA2m(1) model. In

The modelled curves (continuous lines) are compared with ESRF X-ray data for IgA2m(1) and neutron data for IgA2m(1) in 100% 2H2O from Instrument LOQ (open circles). A flat background correction of 1.7% of log Ið0Þ was applied in order to allow for the uniform incoherent scattering arising from the proton content in the sample. Experimental error bars are shown when significant. The PðrÞ curves calculated directly from the models are shown as insets. The a-carbon ribbon trace of the best-fit model is shown. Possible positions of the eight N-linked oligosaccharide chains shown in bold are arrowed, where six of these occur at the angle between the Fab and Fc fragments.

turn, the murine V domains were independently superimposed onto the human V domains independently of the C domains in order to preserve the human Fab elbow angle between the V and C domains. This resulted in only a slightly worsened X-ray R-factor of 8.9% and a similar neutron R-factor of 5.3%, thus showing that the curve fit is unaffected. (2) The IgA2m(1) modelling of Figure 9 had been performed21 prior to publication of the human IgA1 Fc crystal structure.20 The Fc homology model in the IgA2m(1) model was replaced by this crystal structure. After the addition of the tailpieces and missing oligosaccharide chains, the resulting curve fits gave an identical X-ray R-factor of 7.9% and a slightly better neutron R-factor of 5.2%. This indicated that the IgA1 Fc crystal structure was structurally compatible with the Fc homology model used for the scattering curve fits. Sedimentation coefficient modelling for IgA1 and IgA2m(1) The calculated s0 20;w values for the 104 best-fit

IgA2m(1) models (Figure 8) ranged between 7.32 S and 7.82 S using the HYDRO program, and between 7.39 S and 7.93 S using the GENDIA program. These are higher than the experimental sedimentation coefficient s0 20;w value of 6.42 S for IgA2m(1). The mean predicted value from 82 bestfit IgA1 models was 6.92(^ 0.07) S.10 The final IgA1 model gave a predicted s0 20;w value of 6.81 S, which is higher than our experimental values of 6.15 S and 6.20 S, and those of 6.2 ­6.3 S and 6.56 S determined by others.26,35 This meant that both the IgA2m(1) and IgA1 models were too small to replicate the experimental s0 20;w values, even though both structures had been hydrated by the standard amount of 0.3 g/g glycoprotein. An investigation of the HYPRO hydration algorithm (see Materials and Methods) suggested that the IgA models were insufficiently hydrated. Many of the extra hydration spheres were found in the void spaces between the VL ­ VH and the CL ­ CH1 domain pairs and the two CH1 ­CH2 domain pairs, and not on the protein surface. This discrepancy could be rectified by increasing the hydration in both the IgA1 and IgA2 models until agreement was obtained with the experimental s0 20;w values. The addition of a hydration volume

932 of 198 nm3 instead of 67 nm3 caused the s0 value 20;w of IgA1 predicted by GENDIA to decrease to 6.41 S. The addition of 350 nm3 instead of 67 nm3 caused the predicted s0 20;w value of IgA2m(1) to decrease to 6.6 S. This outcome implied that both IgA1 and IgA2m(1) possess a high level of hydration. Control calculations using GENDIA supported this interpretation. Four crystal structures for the FcaRI monomer (PDB codes 1ovz and 1ow0; hydration of 0.3 g/g of glycoprotein) gave a predicted s0 20;w value of 2.7(^ 0.2) S, in satisfactory agreement with the experimental value of 2.36 S.38 The IgA1 Fc fragment (PDB code 1ow0) gave an s0 20;w value of 3.9 S, also in agreement with the experimental value of 3.8 S.38 That for rat Crry (PDB code 1ntj) gave an s0 20;w value of 2.51 S, also within error of the experimental value of 2.4 S.29 The two structures for the mouse chimeric antibody Crry-Ig (PDB code 1ntl) gave s0 20;w values of 5.58 S and 5.73 S, also in satisfactory agreement with the experimental value of 5.4 S.29

Solution Structure of IgA2m(1)

Conclusions
Experimental structures of monomeric IgA1 and IgA2 and their functions IgA1 and IgA2 have few biologically distinct properties. The main difference between the two subclasses is their susceptibilities to proteases, where IgA1 is specifically cleaved by certain bacterial proteases and this is explained by the exposed nature of the longer IgA1 hinge39 ­ 41 (Figure 11). In contrast, the short hinge of human IgA2 not only lacks these protease cleavage sites, but is short enough to make IgA2 less susceptible to proteolysis in the harsh luminal environment following mucosal secretion. The present X-ray and neutron-scattering data have provided new insights into elongation and flexibility in the solution structures of monomeric IgA1 and IgA2m(1). The RG values and the PðrÞ curves show that IgA2m(1) has a more compact structure than that of IgA1. This result is readily attributable to the different lengths of the 23 residue hinge of IgA1 and the ten residue hinge of IgA2m(1). The PðrÞ curves show that the hinges in both IgA subclasses are less flexible in IgG,28 and this is discussed below. These results were determined from experimental data in phosphate-buffered saline that were acquired in a concentration range comparable to the total serum IgA, which is about 3 mg/ml, making the structures physiologically relevant. The same outcome was obtained from both X-ray and neutron data, indicating that the hydration shell surrounding IgA2 had little influence upon the observed structure. In contrast, it was interesting that the analytical ultracentrifugation data were not able to distinguish structurally between the two subclasses, and this

outcome may result from different levels of hydration in IgA1 and IgA2m(1). The identification of structurally extended IgA1 molecules implies that IgA1 is capable of recognising antigenic epitopes that are spatially widely separated, while the identification of more compact IgA2m(1) molecules will correspond to the recognition of epitopes that are positioned more closely together. In combination, monomeric IgA1 and IgA2m(1) will provide a broad range of structural possibilities for high-avidity antigen recognition. Compared to the IgG subclasses and IgA2, IgA1 appears to possess the greatest capability to bind bivalently, and hence with greater avidity, to antigens spaced relatively far apart. Given that the IgA1 hinge is expected to be flexible, as for other antibodies, any IgA1 hinge flexibility will mean that IgA1 can bind efficiently to antigens at a wider range of separations. The increased possibility of high avidity binding to foreign antigens provided by the enhanced "antigenic reach" of IgA1 may explain why the evolution of this subclass has been favoured in humans and apes,9 despite its susceptibility to proteolytic attack. This capability may be advantageous in the immune recognition of pathogens, especially if, as in some bacteria, they express repeated antigenic structural motifs far apart on their surface. The overall picture is, however, more complex, given that the IgA-enhanced pneumoccal adherence of bacteria utilises an IgA1 protease to target the IgA1 hinge in order to promote bacterial colonisation.41 Likewise the concern about susceptibility to proteolysis

may not apply to secretory IgA, nor for IgA agglutinated on a bacterial surface. The expected flexibility of the IgA hinge is qualified by the scattering evidence for relatively inflexible hinges in IgA that was obtained from the separate resolution of the M1 and M2 peaks in the X-ray PðrÞ curves of IgA1 and IgA2 (Figure 3). In contrast, the neutron-scattering data for bovine IgG1/2 showed no sign of these two separate peaks,28 nor were they seen in X-ray scattering data for human myeloma IgD (P.B.F. et al., unpublished observations). The M2 peak would not have been detectable if the IgA hinge was flexible enough to exist in a range of both extended and compact (bent) conformations, as this would mean that the variable separations of the equally sized Fab and Fc fragments in IgA molecules would correspond to a broad spectrum of interatomic distances. This premise was examined further by theoretical calculations of the PðrÞ curve10 based on the intact mouse IgG1 and IgG2a crystal structures. This revealed two separate M1 and M2 peaks for the static T-shaped IgG2a structure, but less visible M1 and M2 peaks in the Y-shaped IgG1 structure (Figure 10). Hence, the observation of a single peak in the PðrÞ curve for bovine IgG1/2 and human IgD means: (i) hinge flexibility has broadened the M2 peak beyond recognition; (ii) the solution structure is Y-shaped; or (iii) both explanations are correct. The extended IgA1 hinge seen by solution-scattering is consistent with electron microscopy observations of IgA1 dimers in which the hinges appear to be extended.26 Other electron microscopy observations of monomeric IgA2 showed that its structure was less flexible than those found in a panel of IgG, IgE and IgM antibodies.27 A functional rationale for this reduced hinge flexibility in IgA would be to ensure that the two Fab fragments are maintained in an extended conformation relative to the Fc fragment, while at the same time retaining enough residual flexibility to enable the two Fab fragments to access a wide range of conformations for optimal antigen binding. It should, however, be remembered that the higher degree of flexibility assigned to monomeric IgA1 compared to IgA2 might be altered upon IgA dimerisation or after secretory component binding. Flexible T-shaped models for monomeric IgA The modelling provides dimensions for the structure of IgA2m(1). In the 15 final IgA2m(1) models, the Fab-to-Fab centre-to-centre distance is 8.2 nm, which is much reduced compared to that of 16.9 nm for IgA1.10 A T-shaped antibody has an inter-Fab angle of 1808 and a Y-shaped antibody has one of 1208. The constrained scattering modelling showed that IgA2m(1) has a predominantly T-shaped arrangement in both the 104 best-fit models (Figure 8) and the final 15 disulphidelinked models. In contrast to this, good scattering fits for bovine IgG1/2 were obtained by fitting to

Figure 11. Comparison of the human IgA1 and IgA2m(1) structures determined by solution scattering modelling with the crystal structures of human IgG1 B12 and hinge-deleted IgG1 Mcg. In the top three images, the light chains are shown in green, and the heavy chains are shown in blue and red. For IgA2m(1), eight light chain disulphide-linked models are shown in blue if the model is T-shaped, and in red if Y-shaped, together with their calculated RG values. For reason of the CNS refinement procedure for the disulphide bridge, these models have partially lost their 2-fold symmetry. The asterisk indicates the published IgA2m(1) model,11 and the double asterisk indicates the model used for Figures 9 and 12.

a 2-fold symmetric Y-shaped arrangement similar to that seen in the crystal structure of IgG1 Kol.28 By comparison, the six known crystal structures for intact human and mouse IgG antibodies also reveal both T-shaped and Y-shaped structures.24,25 One of each of these types is shown in Figure 11. The most related one to IgA2m(1) is the hingedeleted IgG1 Mcg structure, which has a 2-fold symmetric T-shaped structure that is stabilised by the same inter-light chain disulphide bridge found in IgA2m(1).42 The hinge-deleted human IgG1 Dob also shows a 2-fold symmetric T-shaped structure, while the mouse IgG2a Mab231 shows an asymmetric distorted T-shaped structure. Three symmetric and asymmetric Y-shaped structures are represented by human IgG1 Kol, mouse IgG1 Mab61.1.3 and human IgG1 B12. The IgA2m(1) modelling also provides insight into the hinge conformation in IgA. The IgA1 hinge has 23 residues with ten proline residues and is O-glycosylated (PVPSTPPTPSPSTPPTPSP SCCH), while the equivalent in IgA2m(1) has ten residues with six proline residues (PVPPPPPCCH). In the IgA1 hinge, the combination of its O-glycosylation and its proline residues (to reduce main-chain flexibility) with the absence of glycine residues (to act as main-chain conformational swivel points) is predicted to reduce the flexibility of this hinge compared to that in IgG. This prediction is based on Ramachandran f ­ c plots for

934

Gly residues showing that these access 45% of the total rotational space about a peptide bond, hence leading to a high degree of conformational variability, while others such as Ala residues can only access 7.5% of this rotational space, and bulkier side-chains can access even less space.43 Proline is a special case when only one f value of 608 is allowed. In IgA2m(1), the combination of the Cys214 ­Cys214 inter-light chain disulphide bridge with the high abundance of proline residues, the absence of glycine residues, and the relatively short hinge length is predicted to reduce hinge flexibility compared to that in IgG. The existence of relatively inflexible hinges in IgA2 is not only indicated by the PðrÞ curves (see above) but is also suggested from the curve fit modelling procedure, where only a single cluster of the more extended structures gives the best-fit structures. In comparison, the four crystal structures for human IgG1 and mouse IgG1 and IgG2a provided explanations for the more variable hinge conformations in these antibodies.24,25 These hinges are relatively long with 17 ­23 residues, and contain glycine residues, relatively few proline residues, and no glycosylation. Other implications of the IgA1 and IgA2m(1) structures A speculative view of how fully extended monomeric extended T-shaped IgA1 and compact T-shaped IgA2 structures might interact with repeated epitopes on cell surfaces is shown in Figure 12. IgA also binds through its Fc fragment to the IgA receptor FcaRI. There are two FcaRI sites, one on each heavy chain, at a hydrophobic surface patch lying at the CH2 ­ CH3 interface with contributions from both the CH2 and CH3 domains.20,44,45 This site localisation is analogous to the Fc-binding site in IgG for bacterial proteins A

Figure 12. Simplified cartoon of the interaction of monomeric IgA1 and IgA2 with oligosaccharide epitopes on an antigenic bacterial surface (purple) to give an impression of the extended reach of IgA1 compared to IgA2. The simultaneous interaction with the FcaRI receptor on monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages (orange) is also shown. The IgA oligosaccharides are shown in light blue. The IgA structures are shown as T-shapes to follow the best-fit averaged solution structure determinations, however, the hinge region will show flexibility, and Y-shaped IgA structures are possible.

and G, rheumatoid factor, rat neonatal Fc receptor, and the Fc ­ III peptide.20 Figure 12 shows that each Fc heavy chain site is accessible for interactions with FcaRI. This binding is compatible with the simultaneous binding of the same IgA molecule through its Fab fragments to its antigens, enabling the observed 2:1 FcaRI:IgA stoichiometry to take place.20,38 In both IgA models, the location of the FcaRI site at the CH2 ­CH3 interface is well separated from the Fab fragments in their T-shaped arrangement, showing that the T-shaped structures are compatible with FcaRI receptor binding. IgA2m(1) is mostly held intact only by noncovalent interactions between the VH ­ VL and CH1 ­CL domain pairs (Figure 1), because there are no heavy ­ light chain disulphide bridges.46 In the presence of denaturants, dissociation into heavy and light chain dimers occurs.47 Interestingly, minor forms of IgA2m(1) have been shown to possess heavy ­ light disulphide bridges.11 At the top of the Fc fragment, four disulphide bridges can be potentially formed (Figure 1). The crystal structure of the IgA1 Fc fragment20 did not reveal the Cys241 ­Cys241 bridge because Cys242 is the N-terminal residue of this recombinant protein. In the crystal structure, two disulphide bridges between two Cys242 ­ Cys299 pairs were observed, and the two Cys301 side-chains were left unbound. It has been reported that there is less than one free ­ SH group in intact IgA1,48 and this appears to be incompatible with the unbound Cys301 pair in the IgA1 Fc crystal structure. There is, however, the possibility that in IgA2m(1) an unbound Cys301 residue may bridge with the light chain Cys214, and this would offer an explanation of the minor forms with heavy ­ light bridges. Since the separation between the a-carbon atoms of Cys214 and Cys301 is 1.0 nm in the best-fit IgA2m(1) model, small conformational rearrangements in the hinge region would be sufficient for the formation of these minor heavy ­light forms of IgA2m(1) if free Cys ­SH residues exist. IgA2m(1) is more heavily glycosylated (11% (w/w) carbohydrate) than either IgA1 (9.5% (w/w) carbohydrate), or IgG (2.9% (w/w) carbohydrate) (Figure 1). In the IgA2m(1) model, all four N-linked carbohydrate sites at Asn166, Asn262, Asn337 and Asn459 are solvent-exposed, unlike IgG where the single carbohydrate site at Asn297 is buried within the Fc fragment. The rotational orientation of the two Fab fragments is not constrained by the Cys214 ­ Cys214 disulphide bridge, meaning that the position of the Asn166 oligosaccharide chain on the CH1 domain relative to the Fc fragment remains indeterminate. The two oligosaccharide chains at Asn263 and Asn337 are on opposite sides of the Fc fragment, where Asn263 is near the CH2 ­CH3 junction, so steric access to the CH2 surface will be affected by these. The IgA1 Fc crystal structure showed that the Asn263 oligosaccharide makes contact with the protein surface of both the CH2 and CH3 domains.20

Solution Structure of IgA2m(1)

Mutation of the attachment site at Asn263 to prevent glycan attachment did not reduce the affinity of the resultant protein for FcaRI.13 This is as expected, since the other oligosaccharide at Asn337 is too far away to perturb the FcaRI-binding site. Utility of constrained solution-scattering methods to study antibody conformations The scattering modelling study of IgA2m(1) represents a third example of automated curve fit for antibodies based on randomising a hinge peptide conformation and constrained by known crystal structures.10,29 This "random peptide" procedure is well suited for antibodies because this involves only variations in a single peptide conformation, and the outcome is sufficiently detailed to be useful. Solution-scattering does not yield a unique structure determination. However, if the scattering modelling identifies a single best-fit conformational family from randomised trials, this can be reasonably concluded to correspond to the averaged solution structure. Both IgA1 and IgA2m(1) gave a family of 104 related best-fit structures (Figure 8). The Crry-Ig chimeric antibody gave multiple structures that fitted the scattering data slightly less well.29 With hindsight, we consider that these poorer Crry-Ig curve fits may result from excessive flexibility in the Crry-Ig hinge, meaning that all structures were possible, and it was not possible to represent this in terms of a single averaged conformational family. A single IgA2m(1) molecule in solution will be symmetric or asymmetric at any moment, as exemplified by the single snapshot views of the IgG crystal structures.24,25 However, scattering only observes the averaged 2-fold symmetric solution structure. Consequently, an uncertainty in the modelling is the rotational orientation of the Fc fragment about its 2-fold symmetry axis relative to the pair of Fab fragments above it. This is illustrated by the different views of the Fc fragment when the Fab pairs are viewed face-on in the eight IgA2m(1) structures in Figure 11. The constraints used for scattering modelling result in a medium-resolution structure determination with a precision of between 0.2 nm and 1 nm.30 The actual precision depends on the protein of interest, and is assessed by the extent to which deviations from the best-fit structural models lead to worsened curve fits. The accuracy of the homology models used for the curve fits also requires consideration. After this study was completed,21 the crystal structure of the IgA1 Fc fragment complex with the FcaRI receptor was published.20 This provides a fortuitous independent measure of precision. The comparison of our modelled Fc fragment with the IgA1 Fc crystal structure confirmed the previous analysis that showed that the two IgA1 CH2 domains had to be rotated towards each other to form the Cys241 ­ Cys241 disulphide bridge.10 The rmsd of the 200

a-carbon atoms in the CH2 domains between the model and the crystal structure was 0.69 nm, in comparison to a rmsd of 0.24 nm when the 216 a-carbon atoms in the CH3 domains were superimposed. The difference of 0.69 nm is within the estimated precision of the present scattering modelling of 1.0 nm. At this level of accuracy, domain arrangements can be modelled, but not the individual positions of the amino acid sidechains.

Materials and Methods
Preparation and composition of IgA2m(1) and IgA1 Recombinant anti-NIP IgA2m(1) was purified from the culture supernatant of transfected Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells on 4-hydroxy-3-iodo-5-nitrophenylacetyl (NIP)-Sepharose essentially as described31 except that a batch washing procedure was used rather than column chromatography. Briefly, 5 ml of NIP-Sepharose was added to each litre of supernatant and the slurry was rotated overnight at 4 8C. The NIP-Sepharose was washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 3 mM potassium phosphate, 136 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl) using repeated rounds of sedimentation under gravity, removal of supernatant, and dispersion in fresh PBS. IgA2m(1) was eluted with 0.5 mM NIP and dialysed exhaustively against PBS, then concentrated in model 8003 stirred cell concentrators using PM10 membranes (Amicon Ltd, Stonehouse, UK). Alternatively, NIP was removed in a fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) purification step after concentration. Immediately prior to X-ray and neutron-scattering data collection, IgA2m(1) samples were applied to a Superdex 200 gel-filtration column using FPLC to remove non-specific aggregates. The buffer used for data collection was Dulbecco's PBS (12.5 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl) supplemented with EDTA and sodium azide as anti-bacterial preservatives (0.5 mM EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3). X-ray experiments utilised the H2O buffer eluate used in gel filtration, while neutron experiments involved dialysis at 6 8C into 100% 2H2O buffer for at least 36 hours with four buffer changes. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE confirmed that IgA2m(1) migrated principally as a light chain dimer and a heavy chain dimer together with some heavy­ light chain dimers.31,37 For the initial data analyses of IgA2m(1), the a-chain amino acid sequence of IgA2m(1) for the CH1, CH2 and CH3 domains was taken from SWISSPROT (database code P01877). The VH ; VL and CL sequences were initially taken from the crystal structure of human TR1.9 IgG1 Fab (PDB code 1vge), and included the human k light chain. The VH ; VL and CL sequences for the final data analyses were taken from the crystal structure of murine N1G9 IgG1 Fab (PDB code 1ngq), for which the antigen is the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetate, and included the murine l light chain. The mouse antiNIP VH sequence (SWISSPROT code J00529) is identical with the latter's VH sequence. The IgA2m(1) carbohydrate composition was assumed to be similar to that for N-linked oligosaccharides in serum IgA1,10 suggesting that the oligosaccharides at Asn169, Asn253, Asn327 and Asn449 were complex-type with a Man3GlcNAc2 core and two NeuNAc.Gal.GlcNAc antennae. This chimeric murine ­ human composition resulted in a

calculated molecular mass of 163,420 Da, an unhydrated volume of 207.5 nm3, a hydrated volume of 274.2 nm3 (based on a hydration of 0.3 g H2O/g of glycoprotein and an electrostricted volume of 0.0245 nm3 per bound water molecule) and an absorption coefficient at 280 nm (1%, 1 cm path length) of 14.8.33 Human myeloma IgA1 was purified from serum taken from myeloma patients using a combination of a modified thiophilic gel chromatography step to separate the immunoglobulins from other serum proteins in a single step together with jacalin-affinity chromatography, which is specific for the O-linked glycans in the IgA1 hinge.37,49,50 Human serum IgA1 was purified by a similar route from normal individuals. Other details are as before.10

details including the data reduction procedure are as described.10 Analysis of reduced X-ray and neutron data In a given solute­ solvent contrast, the radius of gyration RG is a measure of structural elongation if the internal inhomogeneity of scattering densities within the glycoprotein has no effect. Guinier analyses at low Q give the RG ; and the forward scattering at zero angle Ið0Þ:54 ln IðQÞ ¼ ln Ið0Þ 2 R2 Q2 =3 G This expression is valid in a QRG range of up to 1.5. The relative Ið0Þ=c values (c ¼ sample concentration) for samples measured in the same buffer during a data session gives the relative molecular mass of the proteins when referenced against a suitable standard.10 If the structure is elongated, the mean radius of gyration of cross-sectional structure RXS and the mean crosssectional intensity at zero angle ½IðQÞQQ!0 can be obtained from: ln½IðQÞQ ¼ ½IðQÞQQ!0 2 R2 Q2 =2 XS For immunoglobulins, the cross-sectional plot exhibits two regions, a steeper innermost one and a flatter outermost one,55 and the two analyses are identified by RXS-1 and RXS-2 ; respectively. The RG and RXS-1 analyses lead to the triaxial dimensions of the macromolecule if the structure can be represented by an elliptical cylinder, p where L ¼ 12ðR2 2 R2 Þ and L is its length.54 The RG G XS-1 and RXS analyses were performed using an interactive graphics program SCTPL5 on a Silicon Graphics 4D35S Workstation (A. S. Nealis et al., unpublished software) and a PERL script program SCTPL7 (J. T. Eaton & S. J. Perkins, unpublished software) on Silicon Graphics Indy and O2 Workstations. Indirect transformation of the scattering data IðQÞ in reciprocal space into real space to give PðrÞ was carried out using the GNOM program:56 ð 1 1 PðrÞ ¼ IðQÞQr sinðQrÞdQ 2p2 0 PðrÞ corresponds to the distribution of distances r between volume elements. This offers an alternative calculation of RG and Ið0Þ which is now based on the full range of the scattering curve, and also gives the maximum dimension L: This was used with the IgA2m(1) X-ray curve in the Q range between 0.10 nm21 and 2.20 nm21 and the IgA2m(1) neutron curve in the Q range between 0.13 nm21 and 2.20 nm21. A range of Dmax values was tested, and the final choice of Dmax was based on three criteria: (i) PðrÞ should exhibit positive values; (ii) the RG from GNOM should agree with the RG from Guinier analyses; (iii) the PðrÞ curve should be stable as Dmax was increased beyond the estimated macromolecular length. Sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity data for IgA2m(1) Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 20 8C on a Beckman XL-I instrument in which the IgA2m(1) concentration was monitored using its absorbance at 280 nm and its refractive index measured by interferometry. Sedimentation equilibrium data sets for samples of IgA2m(1) at concentrations of 0.13, 0.24, 0.69,

Synchrotron X-ray and neutron data collection X-ray scattering data were obtained for recombinant IgA2m(1) in two sessions using the camera at Station 2.1 at the SRS at Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK.51 At the SRS, experiments utilised beam currents ranging from 118 mA to 179 mA with a ring energy of 2.0 GeV. Samples were measured at 15 8C in 13 runs at concentrations of 0.42 mg/ml, 0.50 mg/ml and 0.83 mg/ml for ten minutes using ten time-frames. Data acquisitions utilised an area detector with the main beam and beam stop located at one edge of this. Data reduction employed a detector sector between 308 and 1508, which resulted in 300 IðQÞ intensities for use in the Guinier analyses at low Q values (Q range of 0.08 ­1.01 nm21). A second data reduction used a detector sector between 608 and 1208, which resulted in 500 IðQÞ intensities in a fuller range of Q values (Q range of 0.10­ 2.25 nm21), and these were used both for the PðrÞ calculations and the modelling fits. Other details including the data reduction procedure are as described.10 X-ray scattering data were also obtained in two sessions on the Beamline ID02 at the ESRF, Grenoble, France.52 At ESRF, experiments were performed in single-bunch mode to reduce the incident X-ray flux. Storage ring currents ranged from 9 mA to 17 mA with a ring energy of 6.0 GeV. Samples were measured at 15 8C at five concentrations of 0.55, 0.56, 0.82, 0.84 and 1.12 mg/ml in ten time-frames, each exposure lasting for one second or two seconds in Perspex cells of path thickness 1 mm and using 25 mm thick mica windows. Slight radiation damage was observed when determining the RG value from Guinier fits of the ten merged time-frames; accordingly, only the first time-frame was used to avoid its effect. The determinations of the RXS-1 and RXS-2 values were unaffected by this slight radiation damage, and all ten time-frames averaged together were used for these analyses. Data reduction included the calibration of detector intensities using a Lupolen sample, and the calibration of the Q range using a silver salt standard. Neutron-scattering data for recombinant IgA2m(1) were obtained in three different sessions on Instrument LOQ at the pulsed neutron source ISIS at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Didcot, UK.53 The pulsed neutron beam was derived from proton beam currents of 167­ 200 mA. Data acquisitions were for fixed totals of 40 £ 106 ­ 300 £ 106 monitor counts in runs lasting 0.5 ­3.5 hours each for protein in two concentrations of 2.0 mg/ml and 3.0 mg/ml measured at 15 8C.

0.87 and 1.11 mg/ml were each acquired over 45 hours using six-sector cells with solution column heights of 2 mm at rotor speeds of 11,000, 14,000 and 17,000 rpm until equilibrium had been reached at each speed as shown by the perfect overlay of runs measured at five hours intervals. The molecular mass M was analysed on the basis of a single species using Beckman software provided as an addon to Microcal Origin Version 4.1, where  the partial specific volume v for IgA2m(1) was calculated to be 0.722 ml/g from its sequence:33  cr ¼ cr0 exp½ðv2 =2RTÞMð1 2 vrÞðr2 2 r2 Þ 0 where cr is the concentration at radius r; cr0 is the concentration of the monomer at the reference radius r0 ; v is the angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (Kelvin), and r is the solvent density of the buffer. The buffer density was calculated as 1.00543 g/ml from the program SEDNTERP.57 Sedimentation velocity data for IgA2m(1) were acquired over 16 hours at rotor speeds of 15,000, 20,000, 25,000, 30,000, 35,000 and 42,000 rpm in two-sector cells with column heights of 12 mm. Concentrations were 0.28, 0.46, 0.52, 0.69, 1.05 and 1.12 mg/ml. For the gðsp Þ analyses, successive absorbance and interference scans were recorded at ten minute intervals, the shortest interval possible under standard measurement conditions, for which the rotor speed of 20,000 rpm was optimal for IgA2m(1). In time-derivative analyses, the subtraction of pairs of concentration scans versus radius in the cell eliminates systematic errors from baseline distortions in the cell windows and permits the averaging of many pairs of subtractions. The extrapolation of individual subtractions to the start time gives the gðsp Þ function, which was computed using DCDTþ,58 from which the sedimentation and diffusion coefficients (and hence the molecular mass) were determined from the peak position and width, respectively (Figure 5). Between eight and 12 scans were used in order to ensure that the maximum permissible measurable molecular mass calculated from these was over 16 times the expected value,58 meaning that time-broadening effects were negligible. Increased numbers of scans were used to improve the signal­ noise ratio to verify the sedimentation coefficient determination s0 : To avoid time20;w broadening, direct boundary fitting to 120 raw absorbance and interference scans was performed using SEDFIT.59 Initially. the gðsp Þ distribution and a size-distribution analysis were performed to verify the absence of any other sedimentating species in the sample. Final analyses utilised the non-interacting species model based on a single species, which was optimised until the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values and visual appearance of the fits were satisfactory. Homology modelling of the human IgA2m(1) a-chain domains For the modelling, the chimera composition was taken from the human IgA2m(1) sequence,10 with the replacement mouse VH ; VL and CL sequences being taken from the crystal structure of murine N1G9 IgG1 Fab (PDB code: 1ngq60), for which the antigen is the hapten 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetate, and included the murine l light chain. The IgA2m(1) carbohydrate composition was assumed to be similar to that for the N-linked oligosaccharides in IgA1,10 ­ 13 suggesting that the oligosaccharides at Asn169, Asn253, Asn327 and

Asn449 were complex-type with a Man3GlcNAc2 core and two NeuNAc.Gal.GlcNAc antennae. The modelling of IgA2m(1) utilised the previous multiple sequence alignment of human a-chain sequences and averaged secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions.10 This choice was justified by the similarity of the molecular masses calculated from the mouse and human Fab fragment sequences of Figure 6(a) (murine 163,400 Da; human 163,600 Da) and also their dry volumes (murine 207.5 nm3; human 207.8 nm3).33 The sequence numbering followed that for IgA1 (Figure 6(a)) for ease of comparison.10 The homology model for the Fab and Fc fragments in IgA2m(1) was constructed from that created and validated for IgA1, including the folded-back structure for the tailpiece.10 This utilised INSIGHT II 98.0 molecular graphics software with the BIOPOLYMER, DISCOVER, DISCOVER3, HOMOLOGY and DELPHI modules (Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA) on Silicon Graphics O2 and OCTANE Workstations. The IgA2m(1) VH ; VL and CL domains were used unchanged from the crystal structure of the human TR1.9 IgG1 Fab fragment (PDB code 1vge61). The IgA2m(1) CH1 model originated from the CH1 domain in the crystal structure of murine IgA J539 Fab fragment (PDB code 2fbj19). The IgA2m(1) CH2 and CH3 models originated from the CH2 and CH3 domains in the crystal structure of human IgG1 Fc fragment (PDB code 1fc1-A22). A total of 13 amino acid residue changes were made in the IgA1 model to convert this to IgA2m(1), five in the IgA1 CH1 domain, and eight in the IgA1 CH2 domain (including the introduction of an extra N-linked oligosaccharide site at Asn337: Figure 1). The disulphide bridge connectivity in the Fc fragment of IgA2m(1) was retained from that used in the IgA1 model, in which the two CH2 domains were rotated equally towards each other to enable four S­ S bridges to be formed, namely the generally accepted Cys241 ­Cys241 bridge, together with an assumed Cys299 ­Cys299 bridge and two assumed Cys242 ­ Cys301 bridges (asterisked in Figure 6). The stereochemical validity of the resulting IgA2m(1) homology model was confirmed using PROCHECK62 and the Protein Data Bank deposition procedures. Automated modelling of the IgA2m(1) solution structure An automated search strategy was used to model the IgA2m(1) structure, in which a vertical 2-fold symmetry axis centred on the Fc fragment (Figure 1) defined the positions of both Fab fragments relative to the Fc fragment. Structurally, each model was defined by the distance between the centres of mass of the two Fab fragments and that between the Fab and Fc fragment. The hinge length of each model was defined as the distance between the a-carbon atoms of Cys220 and Pro240. The preparation of the models and their scattering curve fits was adapted from Method 2 used for the structure determination of IgA1,10 described as follows. The homology models for the Fab and Fc fragments of IgA2m(1) were combined with 10,000 structures for the 12-residue hinge peptide 220-CPVPPPPPCCHP-244 (Figure 6(a)). This peptide was set up as a b-strand of maximum length 3.54 nm using BIOPOLYMER. A molecular dynamics simulation using DISCOVER3 created random hinge structures from this starting model. In order to generate a wide range of structures, the simulation was performed at a temperature of 773 K. First,

the peptide structure was subjected to energy minimisation for 300 iterations. After a temperature equilibration step of 5000 fs, the simulation was run at 773 K for 1,000,000 fs, capturing models every 100 fs to produce 10,000 of these. Each of the 10,000 complete IgA2m(1) models was produced by a fragment assembly method. Holding the Fc fragment fixed, two copies of each hinge model were added to it by superimposing the four main-chain atoms of Pro240 in the hinge onto those of Pro240 in the Fc fragment. Likewise, the Fab fragments were now added to the hinge peptides by superimposing the main-chain atoms of Cys220 in the hinge and the fragment. The duplicate Pro240 and Cys220 residues were deleted from the model. N-Linked oligosaccharide structures were added to Asn166, Asn263, Asn337 and Asn459 to complete the glycosylated structure (Figure 6(a)). At the end of the automated search for best-fit models, the 50 best-fit IgA2m(1) models were subjected to energy minimisation in order to form connected interchain disulphide bridges in these models. This procedure used the CNS software.63 Initially, structure files were generated for each IgA2m(1) model defining the disulphide bonds within the IgA2m(1) molecule. These were defined as the inter-light chain bridge Cys214 ­ Cys214 and the inter-heavy chain bridges Cys241 ­ Cys241 and Cys299 ­ Cys299. The two internal light chain disulphide bridges Cys23 ­ Cys88 and Cys134 ­ Cys194 and the six internal heavy chain disulphide bridges Cys23 ­ Cys97 (VH), Cys145 ­ Cys204 and Cys196 ­ Cys220 (CH1), Cys242 ­Cys301 and Cys266 ­ Cys323 (CH2), and Cys369 ­Cys432 (CH3) were also defined likewise for CNS (Figure 1). Subsequently, 30 rounds of ten cycles of Powell minimisation followed by 100 cycles of rigid body minimisation were carried out on each of the 50 best-fit models. The rigid bodies are defined in Table 3. For the two hinge peptides joining the Fab fragment to the Fc fragment, each residue was defined as an individual rigid body to allow complete freedom of movement of both the linkers and the adjoining Fab fragments in order to achieve the disulphide connections. At the end, each model was subjected to a final round of 250 cycles of Powell minimisation. Debye scattering curve calculations from sphere models of IgA2m(1) Each IgA2m(1) model was used to calculate X-ray and neutron-scattering curves for comparison with the experimental curves. Each set of atomic coordinates for a model was placed within a three-dimensional grid of cubes. A sphere of equal volume to the cube was placed at the centre of each cube if a user-specified cutoff for the minimum number of atoms contained within a cube was satisfied. For IgA2m(1), a cube side length of 0.534 nm in combination with a cutoff of four atoms con-

sistently produced sphere models within 2% of the total dry volume of 208 nm3 calculated from its composition. The optimal total of dry spheres for IgA2m(1) was 1362 (bottom row of Table 2). Since the hydration shell surrounding glycoproteins is detected by X-ray scattering, the sphere models were accordingly adapted by adding spheres to the surface of the dry models using HYPRO64 based on 0.3 g H2O/g of glycoprotein. The optimal total of hydrated spheres for IgA2m(1) is 1800 (bottom row of Table 2). The X-ray and neutron-scattering curve IðQÞ was calculated assuming a uniform scattering density for the spheres using the Debye equation as adapted to spheres:65 0 1 m X sin Qrj IðQÞ A ¼ gðQÞ@n21 þ 2n22 Aj Ið0Þ Qrj j¼1 gðQÞ ¼ ð3ðsin QR 2 QR cos QRÞÞ2 =Q6 R6 where gðQÞ is the squared form factor for the sphere of radius r; n is the number of spheres filling the body, Aj is the number of distances rj for that value of j; rj is the distance between the spheres, and m is the number of different distances rj : Other details, including those of calibration studies used to validate this approach, are given elsewhere.10,34 X-ray curves were calculated from the hydrated sphere models without corrections for wavelength spread or beam divergence, as these are considered to be negligible for synchrotron X-ray data. Neutron curves were calculated from the dry sphere models and corrected using a 10% wavelength spread Dl/l for a nominal l of 0.6 nm and a beam divergence of 0.016 rad.64 The number of spheres N in the dry and hydrated models after grid transformation was used to assess steric overlap between the Fab and Fc fragments, where models showing less than 95% of the optimal total were discarded (white circles in Figure 7). The models were assessed by calculation of the X-ray and neutron RG and RXS-1 values in the same Q ranges used for the experimental Guinier fits, where values that exceeded specified ranges of ^ 5% resulted in the rejection of these models. Models that passed the filters were then ranked using a goodness-of-fit R-factor defined by analogy with protein crystallography and based on the experimental curves, in the Q range extending to 2.0 nm21 (denoted as R32). A flat background was applied to the final neutron-scattering curve fits in Figure 9 to allow for incoherent scattering contributions from residual protons in the sample (J. T. E. & S. J. P., unpublished calculations). The sedimentation coefficient s0 20;w was calculated directly from the IgA2m(1) models derived from the 104 best-fit scattering curve fits using the program GENDIA.66,67 For reason of computational memory limitations in GENDIA, a larger cube side

length of 0.834 nm and a cutoff of nine atoms was used in place of 0.534 nm during the creation of spheres, and the models were hydrated using HYPRO to give about 380 spheres from which the s0 values were 20;w calculated.64 The s0 20;w values were also calculated using the program HYDRO as a confirmation of the GENDIA analysis.68 In the controls, the cube side was 0.480 nm and the cutoff was two atoms for the IgA1 Fc calculations, and 0.532 nm and three atoms for the FcaRI calculations. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The IgA2m(1) a-carbon co-ordinate model has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession number 1R70.
