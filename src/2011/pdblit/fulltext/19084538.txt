Abstract ERp29 is a ubiquitously expressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, which is found in the folding complexes of several secretory proteins in the ER. In our previous work, it was suggested that ERp29 function is critical for the folding/secretion of thyroglobulin (Tg), a major secretory product of thyroid cells. Current work is an attempt to substantiate this assumption by answering the question whether the secretion of Tg can be regulated through the manipulation of ERp29 expression in the FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. Indeed, transient overexpression of ERp29 resulted in twofold enhancement of the Tg secretion whereas the RNAi-mediated ERp29 silencing led to the attenuation of the Tg export. Mutational analysis has suggested two loci that might be involved in the ERp29-Tg interactions: the interdomain linker including Cys157, an amino acid, which is important for the structural integrity of the C-terminal domain and an uncharged surface on the N-terminal domain flanked by Tyr64 and Gln70.

ERp29 is a soluble resident of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the hitherto uncertain physiological function, although the wealth of circumstantial evidence points to its important role in the early secretory pathway. ERp29 was isolated in our laboratory [1,2] and also by others [3,4] from the cells with high secretory activity and further studies confirmed its preferential expression in the secretory tissues, such as thyroid, pancreas, and other endocrine organs [5,6]. However, the expression profile of ERp29 demonstrates also its presence in all tissues, which in conjunction with the high degree of conservation in mammals and characteristic gene structure allows its classification as a housekeeping protein [5]. Structurally ERp29 is related to protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) [7], enzymes that catalyze the formation and rearrangement of disulfide bridges. However, the absence of the characteristic double cysteine sequence motif and experimental data [8] ruled out specific PDI-like redox activ*

ity. Except mammals, ERp29 homologues are found in birds, flatworms, and insects [9]. In Drosophila, the ERp29like protein Wind is responsible for the escorting of Pipe, a glycosaminoglycan-modifying enzyme to Golgi where it directs the ventral activation of an extracellular serine proteolytic cascade defining the ventral side of the embryo [10]. Recently, we have demonstrated the presence of ERp29 in the folding complexes of the major secretory product of the thyroid epithelial cells, thyroid prohormone, thyroglobulin (Tg) along with the key ER molecular chaperones, BiP and GRP94 [11]. This association was enhanced by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) that triggers the differentiation and proliferation of thyroid cells with the ensuing increase of Tg synthesis. Overload of the ER with nascent Tg molecules was previously demonstrated to activate the transcription of genes of ER chaperones [12], as well as ERp29 [11,13,14] in an adaptive reaction aimed at the restoration of the folding capacity of the ER (unfolded protein response). Moreover, the upregulation of ERp29 was shown also upon increased ER retention of the mutant, transport-incompetent Tg in the human inherited

hypothyroidism [15]. Taken together, these data suggest the important role of ERp29 in the folding/secretion of Tg. To substantiate this assumption we have attempted to answer the question whether the secretion of Tg can be regulated by manipulating the level of ERp29 in the thyroid epithelial cells. Based on the NMR-determined structures of ERp29 domains [7,16] and the crystal structure of Wind [16], we also sought to pinpoint amino acids that could be important for the putative ERp29-Tg interaction. Materials and methods
Expression vectors. Full-length rat ERp29 was amplified by PCR from the rat cDNA library and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). All point mutations (ERp29/Y64A, ERp29/Y64S, ERp29/G67K, ERp29/Q70A, ERp29/G97E, ERp29/C157A, and ERp29/ C157S) and deletions (ERp29/D150­152, ERp29/D153­156, and ERp29/ D150­156) (Fig. 4) were introduced by the site-directed mutagenesis approach using pcDNA3.1-ERp29 as a template. N-terminal domain of ERp29 (ERp29-N, amino acids 33­157) was cloned between BamHI/ EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1 with the addition of the sequence encoding for the ER-retrieval signal of the full-length ERp29 (KEEL). C-terminal domain construct (ERp29-C, amino acids 155­260) was kindly provided by Dr. B. Tsai and contained N-terminally fused sequence encoding for the ERp29 signal peptide (amino acids 1­32). Cell culture and transient transfections. FRTL-5 Fisher rat thyrocytes were cultured in the Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium, containing 5% fetal bovine serum and a hormonal mixture: TSH (1 mU/ml), transferrin (5 lg/ml), somatostatin (10 ng/ml), glycyl-1-histidyl-1-lysine (10 ng/ml), hydrocortisone (10 nM), and insulin (10 lg/ml). Transient transfections were carried out using 1 lg of plasmid DNA (unless otherwise stated) and Lipofectamine2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). These components were mixed in OptiMEM serum-free medium and transfected to the cells as per manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection cell medium was collected, centrifuged for 20 min at 17,000g, and supernatant was used for further analyses. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed by 1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail (``Complete'', Roche) for 15 min, scraped, and centrifuged for 10 min at 17,000g. Ensuing supernatant was used for immunoblotting. Western blot. Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS­PAGE, transferred to the nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with polyclonal antibodies against ERp29 [1], N-terminal domain of ERp29, C-terminal domain of ERp29 [7], Tg (polyclonal anti-rat Tg from Dr. B. Di Jeso, University of Lecce, Italy), PDI (mouse monoclonals, Affinity BioReagents), BiP/GRP78 (polyclonal antibodies from Drs L. Hendershot and L. Meunier from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA), and b-actin (polyclonal anti-rat, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's specifications (Pierce) using luminescent image analysis system LAS 1000+ (Fujifilm).Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using Science Lab software (Fujifilm). siRNA transfection. Two siRNA duplexes with the symmetric dTdT overhangs were designed and chemically synthesized by Dharmacon (www.dharmacon.com). The sense strand of duplex A (5 0 -AGU UCGUCUUGGUGAAGUU) corresponds to the nucleotides 204­222 of the rat ERp29 (Accession U36482, GenBank) and of duplex B (5 0 -AGCUGAACAUGGAGCUGAG) to nucleotides 339­357. Transfections were performed using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Final siRNA concentration was 120 nM. Twenty-four hours before the indicated time periods medium was exchanged to a fresh one and then collected along with cells for immunochemical analysis as it is described in previous sections. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Fifty percentage to 60% confluent FRTL-5 cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 30 min in the methionine/cysteine-free medium, and labeled with the 100 lCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine Promix (Amersham) for 3 h. Cells were washed

Results Overexpression of ERp29 increases the secretion of thyroglobulin We have previously described the association of ERp29 with Tg in the thyroid epithelial cells [11], which prompted the hypothesis of the important role of ERp29 in the Tg folding/export. To address more directly this issue we have overexpressed full-length ERp29 in the FRTL-5 cells and examined the level of Tg secretion. ERp29 overexpression led to the explicit, nearly twofold increase of Tg in the medium (Fig. 1A) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), whereas the intracellular level of Tg was reciprocally decreased. Similar effect was observed in the pulse-chase experiments that demonstrate the ERp29-dependent export of newly synthesized Tg (Fig. 1B). Despite the presence of the ER-retrieval signal (C-terminal tetrapeptide KEEL), substantial amounts of ERp29 can be exported to the cell exterior, apparently in association with the substrate proteins [11]. Such secretion cannot be attributed to the simple leakage from damaged cells, which can be verified by the absence of b-actin and abundant ER chaperone BiP in the medium (results not shown). Interestingly, most of the overexpressed ERp29 was found in the medium (Fig. 1A). However, the analysis of the de novo synthesized labeled ERp29 showed the expected intracellular accumulation of the overexpressed protein (Fig. 1B). Substantial extracellular amounts of ERp29, especially under longer exposure periods, can be partly attributed to the often observed leakage of the overexpressed ER proteins due to the saturation of the retrieval machinery [17]. However, the absence of BiP in the medium would argue against such complete block of the ER retrieval. Therefore, the escorting of the increased amounts of Tg seems to be a more likely explanation for this phenomenon. RNAi-mediated silencing of ERp29 attenuates Tg secretion The negative modulation of the intracellular levels of ERp29 was achieved using the RNA interference (RNAi) technology. Two 21 bp-long RNA duplexes complementary to the different fragments of ERp29 cDNA were transfected to FRTL-5 cells and cell lysates and extracellular medium were analyzed for Tg, ERp29, and other proteins.

(A) FRTL-5 cells were transfected either with empty pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid (vector) or same plasmids carrying ERp29-w/t cDNA. Medium and cells were collected and treated as described in Materials and methods, and immunoblotted with corresponding antibodies (left panel). (B) In a parallel experiment, cells were transfected as indicated above, labeled by the [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture, and chased in the presence of 2 mM unlabeled methionine/cysteine for 6 h. Equal number of cells were immunoprecipitated by anti-Tg or anti-ERp29 and immune complexes were resolved by SDS­PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.

In the preliminary experiments when the cells were harvested 24-48 h after the transfection, no detectable reduction of the intracellular ERp29 was observed (results not shown). As the silencing ability of the transiently transfected siRNAs to a large extent depends on the half-life of the protein, we decided to examine the turnover of ERp29 (Fig. 2). Not surprisingly, ERp29 as many of other ER-resident proteins [18] displayed very slow turnover rate (halflife $52 h). Therefore, further experiments were designed

for the longer siRNA exposures. Indeed, ERp29 silencing became discernible as late as at the day 6 and achieved its maximum by the day 7 (Fig. 3A). Although the ERp29 knockdown was not particularly strong ($60% of the control level on day 7), it had nevertheless the considerable impact on the level of Tg secretion reducing it down to $60% (Fig. 3B). It is reasonable to suggest that this effect would be substantially stronger if not for the combined contribution of such factors as long half-life of

ERp29, low transfection efficiency, and the cell divisionmediated dilution of the silencing effect. Mutational analysis of the ERp29 effect on the secretion of Tg Having established the importance of ERp29 for the Tg transport we next sought to identify the active site(s) and amino acid residues that are critical for ERp29 function. Using NMR spectroscopy, we have previously determined the structure of ERp29 domains and several conserved amino acids, mostly in the N-terminal, thioredoxin-like domain were pinpointed as potential targets for protein-protein interactions [7]. Initially our attention was drawn to the conserved between mammals and insects (Fig. 4) linker region that connects two domains of ERp29. Presence of three glycines and secondary structure data predicts a rather unstructured, surface-exposed, and highly mobile loop, the structural element that is frequently involved in the protein function. Alternatively this linker can serve as a hinge region between two domains of ERp29. Indeed, deletion

of seven amino acids from the linker (ERp29/D150­156, Fig. 4) resulted in the substantial reduction of the Tg secretion when this mutant was expressed in FRTL-5 cells (Figs. 5A and C). We have scanned the entire region by expressing two additional deletion mutants (ERp29/D150­152 and ERp29/D153­156), which showed even stronger inhibition of the Tg export (Figs. 5A and C). This ERp29 fragment contains also a unique, solvent-exposed cysteine (Cys157, Fig. 4). Replacement of this amino acid with either serine (ERp29/C157S) or alanine (ERp29/C157A, results not shown) strongly reduced the Tg secretion down to nearly 40% of the control level (Figs. 5A and C). NMR study revealed two potential multimerization sites that include amino acids Gly67, Gly97, and Asp98 [7]. We have expressed ERp29 mutants where residues from both sites were replaced (ERp29/G67A, ERp29/G97E). However, neither of these mutants could modify the secretion of Tg (Figs. 5A and C; results are shown only for ERp29/G97E). Recently published studies on the crystal structure of the Drosophila homologue of ERp29 [16,19], Wind have suggested that a cluster of conserved tyrosine residues located

between b1 strand and a2 helix of the N-terminal domain and also Tyr86 (Wind numbering) are critically important for the interaction of Wind with its substrate Pipe. We have mutated one of the corresponding amino acids of ERp29, Tyr64 (ERp29/Y64A, ERp29/Y64S, Fig. 4), and expressed the resulting mutant proteins in the thyrocytes. As shown in Figs. 5A and C, ERp29/Y64S (as well as ERp29/ Y64A, result not shown) moderately affected Tg transport reducing it down to 60%, indicating its possible involvement in the ERp29 active site. Mutation of the other solvent-exposed residue from the same region, Q70A, led to a similar drop of the Tg secretion (Figs. 5A and C). Finally, we sought to investigate the functional contribution of the individual domains of ERp29. The N-terminal domain (ERp29-N) and the C-terminal domain (ERp29-C) were constructed so that they would be targeted and retained in the ER similar to the full-length protein (Fig. 4B). Expression of ERp29-N strongly suppressed Tg secretion to the extent comparable with the effect of the ERp29/C157S mutant (Figs. 5B and C). Similar, albeit weaker effect was exhibited by the C-terminal construct (Figs. 5B and C). Decrease in the rate of Tg exit from the cells overexpressing point, deletion mutants, and individual domains is not accompanied by the excessive intracellular accumulation of Tg, such as the one demonstrated in RNAi experiments (Fig. 3). The reason for such inconsistency is not clear. It can be suggested that the mechanisms of the inhibition of Tg secretion in these two cases are entirely different. The reduction of the Tg export by the mutant ERp29s may proceed in a dominant-negative fashion, i.e., mutant proteins can prevent the normal copies of ERp29 from performing their function with the ensuing extended binding of defective ERp29 to Tg. This in turn will not allow Tg to pass the ER quality control [20] with further targeting to the proteasomal degradation pathway. Indeed, the treatment of the cells expressing ERp29/C157S, ERp29/D150­152, and ERp29-N with MG132 proteasomal inhibitor led to the significant accumulation of the intracellular Tg (results not shown). Discussion The network of chaperones and folding enzymes in the ER is part of the quality control machinery that monitors the folding status of nascent polypeptides and releases correctly folded molecules for further secretion or retains misfolded species [20]. It was shown that overexpression of ER chaperones, such as BiP or GRP94, does not accelerate folding of Tg but on the contrary, excessive association with the components of the quality control system slows down the protein maturation with the ensuing deceleration of the secretion [21,22]. At the same time the overexpression of the bona fide secretion factors, such as t-SNAREs [23], Rab proteins [24], and Sec4 [25], results in the explicit boost of the secretion. Therefore, we suggest that the ERp29 overexpression dependent upregulation of Tg export demonstrated in the current study is rather a mani-

festation of the secretion factor/escort protein than of the ``true'' chaperone role characteristic for BiP or GRP94. This is also supported by our previous data showing association of ERp29 with both unfolded and folded molecules of Tg, co-secretion with Tg [11], and the absence of chaperone-like activity of ERp29 in vitro [8]. What might be the molecular basis of the physiological function of ERp29? Our previous NMR study and the crystal structure of Wind predict quite high degree of mobility between the ERp29 domains, suggesting the important role of the linker region. Indeed, all deletion mutants from this fragment were negatively affecting the secretion of Tg. It can be argued that the deletions (including glycines) hinder the relative motion of two domains that might be important for ERp29-substrate interactions. However, it cannot be ruled out that the protein binding site is located either within the linker or in its immediate vicinity. A unique, solvent-exposed, conserved Cys157 (Fig. 4) is one of the potential candidates for such site. Indeed, the replacement of Cys157 with alanine or serine resulted in the drastic reduction of the Tg secretion. Examination of the local structure around Cys157 in the C-terminal domain (starting at the residue Pro155) revealed that in the majority of 20 NMR structures [7] the thiol group of Cys157 is involved in the intricate net of van der Waals/hydrogen bond interactions between the residues from helix 5 (Glu238 and Asn245) (Fig. 6). Removal of the thiol (Cys157Ala) or even replacement for the smaller and more hydrophilic hydroxyl group (Cys157Ser) might disrupt this interaction and allow helix 5 to move away. Hence it seems that Cys157 plays a major role in the structural integrity of ERp29 and more specifically in the stabilization of its C-terminal domain. However, it would be premature also to rule out hypothetical redox activity of this residue, which can theoretically form mixed disulfides with substrate proteins. The question remains as to whether this residue and the whole linker might be directly involved in the interaction with the ERp29 protein substrates. While the manuscript was in preparation, a study was published where the authors investigating the biophysical properties of the Cys157Ser ERp29 mutant revealed the reduced surface hydrophobicity and increased proteolytic lability of the mutant protein suggesting thus its important structural role [26]. Noting the high hydrophobicity of the linker, the authors suggested that it could represent a potential site of interaction with the unfolded substrates. Are there other potential peptide-binding sites on the ERp29 surface? Two recently published papers presented an in-depth analysis of the substrate binding site(s) of Wind [16,19]. The major binding site of Wind was identified as a shallow pocket around Asp50 (Wind numbering) and two tyrosines, 53 and 55, localized in the turn before the a2 helix. These residues are conserved between Wind and ERp29. Mutation of one of these tyrosines (Tyr64) in ERp29 led to the pronounced reduction in the export of Tg. Similar effect was produced by the mutation of another solvent-exposed amino acid from the same region, Gln70.

Analysis of the electrostatic surface of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 7) revealed an uncharged cleft between these ° residues (approximately 13 A wide) that might accommodate proteins of sufficiently large size and hence be important for ERp29-substrate interaction. The Wind study also suggested a putative functional locus on the C-terminal domain that forms a second site responsible for the interaction with Pipe. Similarly to Wind, the overexpression of the C-terminal domain of ERp29 negatively affected the secretory function of ERp29 apparently via the competition with the endogenous ERp29. This might indicate more functional role of this domain rather than being merely responsible for the retention and/or solubility of the full-length protein. In conclusion, our findings provide unambiguous evidence of the previously alleged essential function of ERp29 in the early secretory pathway. The export of the

major secretory product of the thyroid epithelial cells, Tg, was found to be strongly regulated by ERp29. Additionally we have localized two ``suspicious'' regions that might be implicated in the ERp29-substrate interactions. These findings open interesting perspectives for deciphering the physiological and molecular function of ERp29 in more detail.
