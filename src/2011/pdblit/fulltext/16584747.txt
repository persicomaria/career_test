Abstract We characterized tellina virus 1 (TV-1), a birnavirus isolated from the marine bivalve mollusk Tellina tenuis. Genome sequence analysis established that TV-1 is representative of a viral cluster distant from other birnaviruses. The maturation process of the polyprotein encoded by the genomic segment A was delineated with the identification of the N-termini of the viral protease VP4 and the ribonucleoprotein VP3, and the characterization of peptides deriving from the processing of pVP2, the VP2 capsid protein precursor. One of these peptides was shown to possess a membrane-disrupting domain. Like the blotched snakehead virus, the polyprotein exhibits a non-structural polypeptide (named [X]) located between pVP2 and VP4. Mutagenesis analysis allowed the identification in VP4 of a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad that does not possess the common Gly-X-Ser signature of the serine hydrolases. The genomic segment B encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase VP1 with the unique sequence motif arrangement identified in other birnavirus VP1s. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction Birnaviruses infect animal species as different as vertebrates, mollusks, insects and rotifers (Delmas et al., 2005). Tellina virus 1 (TV-1) was isolated from the marine bivalve mollusk Tellina tenuis (Hill, 1976) and later assigned to the Birnaviridae family (Brown, 1986; Dobos et al., 1979). This family includes viruses with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome and consists of the four genera: avibirnavirus (type species: infectious bursal disease virus [IBDV]), entomobirnavirus (type species: Drosophila X virus (DXV), aquabirnavirus (type species: infectious pancreatic necrosis virus [IPNV]) and blosnavirus (type species: blotched snakehead virus [BSNV], another aquatic birnavirus). Cross-neutralization assays with these different viruses indicated that DXV, IPNV, IBDV and BSNV were antigenically distant from TV-1 (Dobos et al., 1979; Hill and

Way, 1995; John and Richards, 1999). In the absence of crossneutralization between IPNV serotypes and TV-1, the latter was proposed to define the type of the serogroup B in the so-called "IPNV-like" viruses (Hill and Way, 1995). Two strains of aquatic birnaviruses isolated from dab (Limanda limanda) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) have been reported antigenically related to TV-1 (Ahne et al., 1989; Olesen et al., 1988). Birnavirus particles are single-shelled non-enveloped viruses with a T = 13laevo icosahedral capsid of about 70 nm in diameter (Böttcher et al., 1997; Pous et al., 2005) made of the capsid protein VP2 (Coulibaly et al., 2005; Saugar et al., 2005). Peptides deriving from the processing of pVP2, the VP2 precursor, are present in virions (Da Costa et al., 2002, 2003; Galloux et al., 2004), but they do not follow the icosahedral symmetry of the virus. The VP3 protein is internal and forms ribonucleoprotein complexes with the genome (Hjalmarsson et al., 1999). The viral particles also contain VP1, the viral polymerase, which is found free or covalently linked to the genomic segments (Dobos, 1995).

For most birnaviruses, genome segment A encompasses two overlapping open reading frames (ORF), with a large one encoding the pVP2-VP4-VP3 polyprotein (about 1000 amino acids long) and a small one, whose position is genus-specific, encoding a protein called VP5 in IBDV. For BSNV, an additional large peptide, named [X], is encoded between the pVP2 and VP4 reading frames (Da Costa et al., 2003). The polyprotein is cotranslationally cleaved by the protease VP4 to generate pVP2, VP4 and VP3 (and [X] for BSNV). pVP2 is further processed at its C terminus by VP4 to generate VP2 and peptides that remain associated to the viral particles. The VP4 protease has been shown to use a serine­lysine catalytic dyad to process the polyprotein (Birghan et al., 2000; Petit et al., 2000; Lejal et al., 2000). Genomic segment B encodes VP1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (von Einem et al., 2004). The VP1 proteins of the birnaviruses and the replicases of two positive stranded RNA viruses described as tetra-like viruses were proposed to contain a unique arrangement of the RdRp motif, revealing a lineage in the RdRp phylogenic tree (Gorbalenya et al., 2002; Shwed et al., 2002). The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of the IBDV VP1 confirmed the existence of its unusual active site topology (Pan et al., 2007). In this study, we characterized TV-1 and found that it should be considered as a virus defining a new viral cluster in the Birnaviridae deeply divergent from the other aquatic birnaviruses IPNV and BSNV. The recent elucidations of the atomic structures of the VP2 of IBDV (Coulibaly et al., 2005; Garriga et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006) and the VP4s of BSNV and IPNV (Feldman et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007) allow the identification by multialignment analyses of the amino acids involved in the antigenicity of TV-1 virions and in the substrate recognition of the TV-1 VP4 protease, respectively. Results and discussion Molecular cloning and sequence of the TV-1 genomic segments A and B The complete coding region of the segment A was recovered by RT-PCR with five overlapping cDNA clones. All these clones were sequenced to assess that no artifact occurs during the amplification and cloning processes. Compiling the sequencing data (EMBL database accession no. AJ920335) allowed the determination of the sequence of two overlapping open reading frames (ORF) on the same strand. The large ORF of 1114 codons is preceded by a 100-nucleotide 5-untranslated region and thus designated as the polyprotein ORF. The small ORF of 165 codons started at nucleotide 861. Comparison to known sequences in databases was carried out with BLAST programs. Significant homology was mainly detected at the amino acid level with the VP2s of other birnaviruses (Table 1). Next, a RTPCR product covering the large ORF was produced and cloned. Sequence analysis of two independent clones confirmed the nucleotide sequence of the ORF. Several clones specific to segment B were also isolated. A compilation of the sequence data obtained from these clones

allowed the identification of a unique ORF (EMBL database accession no. AJ920336). This ORF encodes an 894 amino acid long protein that shares sequence homologies with the VP1 RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of other birnavirus. The VP1 of TV-1 possesses the unique sequence motif arrangement identified in other birnavirus VP1s (Gorbalenya et al., 2002). Identification of two primary cleavage sites in the polyprotein Since birnavirus VP4 proteases have been reported to be active in E. coli (Petit et al., 2000; Lejal et al., 2000; Da Costa et al., 2003), we chose this expression system to identify by N-terminal sequencing the cleavage sites at the N-termini of VP4 and VP3. For this purpose, we engineered into the pET-28b vector (Novagen) a first construct named [X]-VP4-30 encoding a 5-truncated form of the polyprotein, overlapping all the putative primary cleavage sites (Fig. 1). The X-VP4-30 was expressed in E. coli and bacterial lysate extracts were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Coomassie blue staining. Two products with relative masses of about 25 and 30 kDa were identified, suggesting efficient cleavage of [X]-VP4-30. Their N-termini were determined as Ser-Thr-Asn-Pro-Phe for the 30 kDa protein and Ala-Asp-Arg-Pro-Met for the 25 kDa protein. These amino acid sequences were identical to the predicted polyprotein sequence starting at Ser-831 (N terminus of VP3) and Ala-619 (N terminus of VP4), respectively. Therefore, cleavages occurred between an Ala and a Ser at positions 830­831 and two Ala at positions 618­619. An additional construct (named VP40) overlapping the 5 part of the VP4 reading frame was also expressed in E. coli. Its cleaved product identified in bacterial extract by SDS-PAGE was submitted to Edman degradation. The resulting sequence confirmed that the N-terminus of VP4 was located at Ala-619. The TV-1 VP4 and VP3 proteins were thus predicted to be 212- and 284-amino acids long, respectively. The pVP2 C-terminal domain and its derived-peptides Fig. 2 shows a multi-alignment of the C-terminal domains of the birnavirus pVP2s. The sequence comparison is anchored to the multiple cleavage sites identified in the C-termini of pVP2 of IBDV, IPNV and BSNV (Galloux et al., 2004 and references therein) and to the cleavage site mapped at the pVP2-VP4 junction of DXV (Chung et al., 1996). We predicted from this alignment that the pVP2 processing of TV-1 might result in the generation of mature VP2 (amino acids 1 to

451 of the polyprotein) and three peptides (amino acids 452 to 492, 493 to 499 and 500 to 512 of the polyprotein). The [M + H]+ theoretical monoisotopic masses of the three peptides were expected to be 4325.29, 645.37 and 1391.71 Da, respectively. Because the IBDV, IPNV and BSNV pVP2-derived peptides have been identified on viral particles, we investigated their putative TV-1 homologues on purified virions by mass spectrometry analysis. A main peptide with an [M + H]+ mass of 1391.73 Da was indeed detected. This mass fitted well with the theoretical mass of the predicted 13 amino acids long peptide extending from Ala-499 to Ala-512 (1391.71 Da), and which

constitutes the C-terminus of pVP2. An additional peptide with a mass of 645.42 Da was detectable, corresponding to the 7 aa long stretch from Ala-493 to Ala-499. The existence of the peptide 452­492 was not evidenced, probably due to the virus purification procedure, which includes a preliminary PEG 6000 concentration of the virus. In the mass range around the predicted mass of this peptide, a series of signals due to the PEG molecules detection masked the expected signal at 4325.29 Da. From these results and the sequence alignment between different birnavirus C-terminal pVP2 domains (Fig. 2), we assumed that the pVP2 processing generates VP2 and three small peptides

(residues 452 to 492 [we named pep41 since it is predicted 41 amino acids long], 493 to 499 [pep7], and 500 to 512 [pep13]) that remain associated with the viral particles. We recently reported (Galloux et al., 2007) that the pep41 IBDV homologue (we named pep46) deforms synthetic and biological membranes and induces pores, a property we proposed associated to cell entry into its target cells. The poreforming domain of pep46 was identified as its N terminus moiety (pep22IBDV). To extend these findings to TV-1 and another birnavirus, IPNV, the peptides made of the first 25 N-terminal amino acids of TV-1-pep41 (pep25TV1) and of the first 22 of its IPNV homologue (pep22IPNV) were synthesized. The permeabilizing activity of pep25TV1, pep22IPNV and pep 22IBDV was quantified by measuring the release of a cytoplasmic enzyme (LDH) induced by each peptide. The effects of the peptides were analyzed for time and concentration dependence. Fig. 3A shows that pep25TV1 permeabilizes the cell membranes with a kinetic constant higher than its homologues. Fig. 3B shows that pep25TV1 has a lower critical concentration than its two homologues. An effect could be even detected for pep25TV1 at a concentration of 2 M, in contrast to pep22 IPNV and pep22IBDV. These experiments demonstrate that the N-terminal moiety of pep41 permeabilizes cell membrane, like its birnavirus homologues. To further characterize the pore formation mechanism, we studied the activity of pep25TV1 and homologues on synthetic

membranes. The peptides were incubated with liposomes containing a fluorescent probe, which due to quenching effects has a fluorescence signal strongly depending upon concentration. The release of the probe from the liposomes leads to a lowering of the probe concentration and thus to an increase of the fluorescence signal. With pep25TV1, at a concentration of 1 M, the release of the probe from liposomes is achieved within a few seconds (Fig. 3C). pep25TV1 is also characterized by a critical concentration below which the peptide has no effect on the probe release. No effect could be detected at a concentration of 25 nM. Pep22IPNV and pep22IBDV also exhibited a permeabilization activity with different kinetics and lag periods (Fig. 3D). These observations demonstrate that the larger peptide that derives from the processing of pVP2 in TV-1 and IPNV virions possesses a domain able to destabilize cell and synthetic membranes, like their IBDV homologue. Primary processing of the TV-1 polyprotein At this point, we also noticed that the TV-1 pVP2 C-terminus (mapped on amino acid 512) and the VP4 N-terminus (mapped on amino acid 619) were distant on the polyprotein. This suggested the existence in the polyprotein of an exogenous peptide inserted between the pVP2 and VP4 domains, as previously observed in the polyprotein of other birnavirus, BSNV (Da Costa et al., 2003).

To analyze the primary processing of the TV-1 polyprotein harboring a putative exogenous [X] polypeptide, we cloned the cDNAs encoding the complete polyprotein (amino acids [aa] 1 to 1114) and the predicted following polypeptides: pVP2-[X] (aa 1 to 618), pVP2 (aa 1 to 512), [X] (aa 513 to 618), VP4 (aa 619 to 830) and VP3 (aa 831 to 1114) under the control of the T7 promoter (Fig. 4A). The in vitro processing of the full-length TV-1 polyprotein was analyzed by comparing the electrophoretic mobility of the processed products and the different polypeptides (Fig. 4B, left). The polyprotein processing yielded four polypeptides with apparent Mw of 24, 30, 52 and 70 kDa, which were found to comigrate with VP4, VP3, pVP2 and pVP2-[X], respectively. While the cleavage appeared to be very efficient at the junctions between VP3 and VP4, VP4 and [X], only about 20% of cleavage occurred at the pVP2-[X] junction. Using other gel electrophoresis conditions with higher acrylamide concentrations, we were not able to detect a cleavage product deriving from the polyprotein processing and comigrat-

ing with the peptide [X], suggesting that it could be unstable or processed by VP4 (not shown). Note also that the predicted polypeptide encoded by the small additional ORF was not evidenced in these experiments. To further validate the protein assignment we carried out by N-terminal sequencing, identification of pVP2-derived peptides and electrophoretic mobility comparisons, mutants expressing the complete polyprotein with substitutions at the P1-P1 position of the cleavage sites between pVP2 and [X], [X] and VP4, VP4 and VP3 were generated (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B, right panel, shows that all the substitutions generated completely blocked the processing at the expected junctions. Furthermore, blocking the cleavage at one target site did not interfere with cleavages at other sites. In these in vitro experiments, we thus validated the mapping of the three cleavage sites controlling the release of pVP2, [X], VP4 and VP3. Taking into account the amino acid sequences composing the cleavage sites of the polyprotein, all of them could be defined

by the Ala-X-AlaAla motif, with the P1 position that can accommodate either with Ser, Gly or Trp (Fig. 4C). The TV-1 polyprotein cleavage motif resembles, but is different from the cleavage sites defined in other birnavirus polyproteins (Chung et al., 1996; Sanchez and Rodriguez, 1999; Petit et al., 2000; Da Costa et al., 2002, 2003; Galloux et al., 2004). Identification of the TV-1 VP4 protease catalytic site Preliminary pairwise alignment of the VP4 of TV-1 with its birnavirus homologues did not allow the prediction of the residues that could be involved in its activity. Ser-695 and Ser738 were both candidates to the catalytic dyad (Ser, Lys) defined in other birnavirus proteases. In contrast to Ser-738, Ser-695 is preceded at position -2 by a glycine, revealing the possible GlyX-Ser signature of serine hydrolases. However, like observed in other birnavirus proteases, Ser-738 is distant by about 40 amino acids from a possible catalytic lysine (Lys-777). To determine their relative importance in the TV-1 polyprotein maturation processing, these residues were substituted by alanine, the resulting full-length polyproteins were expressed and their processing analyzed by PAGE (Fig. 5). The replacement of Ser-738 and Lys-777 completely inactivated the polyprotein processing. Substitution of Ser-695 had a slight effect on the processing. To further confirm the catalytic nature of residues 738 and 777, they were substituted by amino acid homologues. Again, Lys-777Arg and Ser-738Thr substitutions resulted in a complete block of the processing. The Ser-738Cys substitution allowed recovery of VP3, showing that this residue can also mediate the nucleophile

attack of the scissible peptide bond. The phenylalanine residue at position - 2 of Ser-738 was also substituted by an aromatic residue (Trp) or a Gly. The substitution by a Trp residue had minor effect on the processing, in contrast to the Gly substitution. We thus identified the serine and lysine residues that constitute the catalytic site of the VP4 protease, and showed that the Gly-X-Ser serine hydrolase signature is not conserved in TV-1, unlike in other birnavirus VP4s. The atomic structure of the VP4s of IPNV and BSNV has been recently elucidated (Feldman et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2007). For these two VP4s, residues that flank the substrate binding site and contribute to interactions with the substrate are identified (Fig. 5). The alignment shows that the substrate binding pocket of the birnavirus VP4s mainly exhibits residues specific for each protease (excepted a conserved Pro-Val doublet), a feature that explain their slight differences in cleavage specificity. TV-1 genetic organization While the genetic organization of TV-1 genome segments A and B is similar to those of other birnaviruses, several particular features have to be enlightened. A 106-aa-long polypeptide (named [X]) is encoded by the polyprotein gene. Its coding region is inserted between those of pVP2 and VP4, a feature previously reported for an additional polypeptide in the BSNV polyprotein (Fig. 6). While this polypeptide does not exhibit sequence homology with its BSNV analog, its N-terminal sequence (NH2-GERPLSRQITRIARTAARMTATALRSAALTP...) allowed the prediction of an amphipathic -

helices. Secondly, a small ORF is located inside the VP2-encoding sequence at a different position than those reported as VP5 ORFs for other birnaviruses. No sequence similarity was identified between the sequence of the putative encoded product and any of the VP5s sequences of other birnaviruses. The structural basis for the antigenicity of TV-1 The elucidation of the 3D-structure of the VP2 of IBDVand a multialignment with its birnavirus VP2 homologues allow the prediction of the residues involved in TV-1 antigenicity. The VP2 capsid protein of birnaviruses is folded into three domains, labeled base (B), shell (S) and projection (P) (Fig. 7). The domain P is -barrel with the "jelly-roll" topology, oriented such that the -strands are radial to the viral particle. The four loops PBC, PDE, PFG and PHI (P-domain) and to a lesser extent the P domain PCHEF constitute the most exposed domain of the viral particle. In IBDV, these loops are associated in antigenicity modulation and adaptation to cell culture. The alignment shows that all the residues constituting the four P loops of the VP2 of TV-1 are unique; they are likely to contribute to the antigenicity of TV-1 and to contacts with a receptor on the target cell. These observations provide a strong rationale to explain the absence of cross-reactivity between specific sera against TV-1 and other birnaviruses.

Sequence comparison between TV-1 and other birnavirus proteins Table 1 shows the percentage of amino acid identity detected in pairwise alignments among birnavirus proteins. The TV-1 sequences of VP1 and VP2 have only 34 and 37% identity with their most similar homologues, the VP1 and VP2 of BSNV. Multialignment of the VP1 birnavirus sequences (not shown) reveals the conservation of the unique non-canonical motif arrangement in the TV-1 VP1 palm subdomain (Gorbalenya et al., 2002). The VP3 sequences have deeply diverged during birnavirus evolution, suggesting that the structural constraints for the VP3 function are less restrictive than for VP1 and VP2. A possible ancestral genomic rearrangement or recombination event between birnaviruses could not be evidenced by sequence comparisons. Fig. 8 shows phylogenetic trees carried out with VP1 and VP2 protein sequences of birnavirus representatives. Whatever the protein analyzed (VP1 or VP2), TV-1 appears to be phylogenetically distant from all birnaviruses characterized to date and to group with DXV rather than with other birnaviruses. This position was obtained using both neighbor-joining and parsimony analysis, and supported by high bootstrap values (N900/ 1000) except for the VP2 parsimony analysis (bootstrap = 700/ 1000). Interestingly, while TV-1 and BSNV share an extra-

In conclusion, we characterized the genome and the polyprotein processing of TV-1. This virus appears to define a fifth genetic cluster among the birnaviruses. These observations

emphasize the unexpected diversity of the aquatic birnaviruses with the IPNV, BSNV and TV-1 relatives. Materials and methods

by aspiration using a needle and a syringe. The virus was desalted using MicrospinTM G-25 Columns (Amersham Biosciences UK). Cloning of the TV-1 genome

Virus production and purification TV-1 was propagated in bluegill fry (BF-2) cells. Once the cytopathic effect was complete, the cells and supernatants were frozen at - 80 °C. After defrosting, a clarification step was carried out at 5000 g for 15 min and the supernatants were stored at - 80 °C. The cell line was maintained at 20 °C during infection in Glasgow modified Eagle minimum essential medium with 2% fetal bovine serum and buffered with 25 mM HEPES (pH7.5). Polyethylene glycol 6000 was added to the infected cell extracts supernatants at a final concentration of 10% (w/v). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the supernatants were centrifugated for 1 h at 4000 rpm. Pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris (pH7.4), 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and treated with Freon 113. Purification was carried out by density gradient centrifugation (18 h at 35,000 rpm) in a CsCl solution (density = 1.33). The virus bands were collected Purified virus was resuspended in TNE (10 mM Tris (pH 80, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), and treated with SDS-proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Viral RNA was recovered following a phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA was denatured with hydroxymethyl mercury and cDNA was synthesized using a pdN6 primer and the SuperScript cDNA synthesis kit from InVitrogen. Two oligonucleotides whose sequences were derived from the sequence of the VP2 gene of BSNV (5-GTCTACGCACTCAACGGGACCTTCAA and 5GATGTTCTTTGCCAGTTCTGGGTTTGG) were used for DNA amplification using the rtTh DNA polymerase (Perkin Elmer). Briefly, PCR conditions were 94 °C for 8 min and then 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 2 min, for 30 cycles. A PCR product was obtained and cloned in the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega). Several clones were sequenced and encompassed parts of the VP2 reading frame. Two specific

primers pointing outward were then designed from this TV-1 VP2 sequence (5-TACACCGACCTGACTCCAGGCGGCATC AT G a n d 5  - C AT G AT G C C G C C T G G A G TCAGGTCGGTGTA) to expand the TV-1 segment A sequence. A PCR second round was performed from the cDNA previously obtained, using these two primers in combination with short random primers at a low annealing temperature (37 to 45 °C). PCR products were subsequently gel-purified, cloned and sequenced. Several sequences overlapping the first amplicon were identified. The same process was repeated once more using new (outer) TV-1-specific primers (Table 2) pointing outward and completed the polyprotein gene cloning. During the screening for the segment A clones, several plasmids carrying segment B inserts were also identified. The same strategy was used to determine the full sequence of segment B. Primers (Table 2) were designed and used at low annealing temperature. Due to this cloning strategy using a single sequence-specific primer in each reaction, a few nucleotides may miss at the 5 and 3 termini of the sequences of both segments. Construction of plasmids expressing the complete TV-1 polyprotein or truncated forms The complete polyprotein ORF was amplified by RT-PCR with the following oligonucleotides, 5-GCGCGCGAATTCATGGCTTCAAAACAGTTCTCAATGCTTG and 5-CCGGAATTCTTACAGCATACC (primer 3). The 3.3 kb long PCR product was EcoRI restricted and cloned into pcDNA3 (In Vitrogen) under the control of the T7 promoter to generate pc TV1A. To clone the reading frames of pVP2, [X] and pVP2-[X] under the control of the T7 promoter, oligonucleotides were designed to introduce an initiation codon and a stop codon upstream and downstream of the reading frame where appropriate. The corresponding PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or pET-28b+ (Novagen). To obtain the [X]-VP4-30 and VP40 constructs, PCR was carried out with primer 3 used with the oligonucleotides GCGCCGGAATTC-

ATGGCCAATGCCGCAAGTGGAAG and CCGGAATCGCTGAAGTCGCCCAGGCCGCCGAC, respectively. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI site of pET-28b+. Site-directed mutagenesis of pc-TV1A Mutations were introduced by using Pfu DNA polymerase with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Sequence analysis was carried out to confirm the nucleotide substitutions. The putative VP4 catalytic residues were replaced by an alanine or other amino acids. P1­P1 residues of cleavage sites were substituted by a glutamine­phenylalanine doublet. Expression of the TV-1 polyprotein and derived constructs T7-driven in vitro expression was carried out using the TNT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer and in a final volume of 11 L. The DNA template (1 g) was incubated for 1.5 h at 30 °C, aliquots of 2­3 L were submitted to 10% SDS-PAGE and the gels were dried for autoradiography. The in vivo expression of [X]-VP4-30 and VP40 was carried out in Bl21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Overnight cultures of cells carrying the constructs were diluted in an equal volume of the LB medium containing kanamycin (50 g/mL) and expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at room temperature. Aliquots of induced (or noninduced) cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Amino acid sequence analysis For VP4 and VP3 N-terminal sequence determination, the electrophoretic sample was transferred onto the PVDF membrane by passive absorption. After a destaining step, the band of interest was excised, dried in a speed-vac for 30 min and the gel piece was hydrated in 0.2 M Tris­HCl, pH 8.5, 2% SDS (50 L) for 30 min. HPLC water (200 L) was added with a piece of

PVDF membrane (Problott) (4 × 4 mm) to the gel solution. The mixture was incubated 2 days at room temperature (23 °C) with gentle vortexing. At the end of this transfer time, the gel piece and the solution were clear and the membrane was blue. The membrane was washed 5 times with 1 mL 10% methanol with vortexing. After drying, the membranes were placed in the cartridge of the Perkin-Elmer Procise 494 HT protein sequencer. N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses were performed by automated Edman chemistry with the manufacturers' methods and reagents. Mass spectroscopy analysis

Cell toxicity assay The hepatocarcinoma epithelial chicken LMH cell line was grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The activity of peptide was determined by measuring the LDH release after incubation at 37 °C, using the cytotox 96 non-radioactive kit (Progema), as described by the manufacturer. The percentage of LDH release was determined taking in account the OD values found on untreated and Triton X-100-treated cells. All experiments were carried out three times on duplicated samples. Acknowledgments

Four microliters of 50% v/v acetonitrile + 0.3% v/v trifluoroacetic acid was added to the dried virus sample for 10 min with vortexing. The sample was desalted on a ZipTip C4 (Millipore) and eluted with 0.5 L of 70% v/v acetonitrile, 0.3% v/v trifluoroacetic acid. The sample was directly spotted onto the MALDI plate and dried at room temperature before addition of 0.5 L of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (- CHCA, 3 mg/mL) in 50% v/v acetonitrile + 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE-STR time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (Laser Science, Franklin, MA, USA, emitting at  = 337 nm). The accelerating voltage used was 20 kV. All spectra were recorded in a positive reflector mode and with a delayed extraction of 130 ns and a 62% grid voltage. The spectra were calibrated using an external calibration which was composed of Des-Arg Bradykinin (M + H)+ = 904.4681 Da, angiotensin (M + H)+ = 1296.6853 Da, neurotensin (M + H)+ = 1672.9175 Da, melittin (M + H)+ = 2845.762 Da and bovine insulin B chain (M + H)+ = 3494.6513 Da. Liposome perforation assay Large anionic unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by reverse phase evaporation as described (Rigaud et al., 1983) using a mixture of egg phosphatidylcholine and egg phosphatidic acid (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) at a molar ratio of 9/1. The buffer used for the preparation was 5 mM sodium phosphate/citrate, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7, supplemented with 50 mM sulforhodamine B (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). The preparation was extruded through 0.4 and 0.2 m polycarbonate filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) to obtain LUV of a uniform size distribution of about 170 nm. The final phospholipids concentration was about 16 mg/mL (20 mM). LUV were separated from non-entrapped sulforhodamine B by size exclusion chromatography on a G25 sephadex column. The release of sulforhodamine B after addition of peptides was monitored by the increase of fluorescence at 586 nm, using a 565-nm excitation band in a FP-750 spectrofluorimeter (Jascon, Tokyo, Japan) at 22 °C in a thermostated (Perkin Elmer) cell holder under constant magnetic stirring, and using a 1 cm path length quartz cell. The value of 100% release was obtained by addition of Triton X-100 at the end of the reaction.
