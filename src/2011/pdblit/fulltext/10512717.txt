DNA photoproducts with (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone adducts formed by ultraviolet radiation are implicated in mutagenesis and cancer, particularly skin cancer. The crystal structure of the Fab fragment of the murine 64M-2 antibody speci®c to DNA T(6-4)T photoproducts is determined as a complex with dT(6-4)T, a (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoÊ dimer of dTpT, at 2.4 A resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 0.199 and an Rfree value of 0.279. The 64M-2 Fab molecule is in an extended arrangement with an elbow angle of 174  , and its ®ve complementaritydetermining regions, except L2, are involved in the ligand binding. The bound dT(6-4)T ligand adopting a ring structure with (6-4) linked 5H thymine-3H pyrimidone bases is fully accommodated in an antigen-binding Ê Ê pocket of about 15 A Â 10 A. The 5H -thymine and 3H -pyrimidone bases are in half-chair and planar conformations, respectively, and are nearly perpendicular to each other. The 5H -thymine base is hydrogen-bonded to Arg95H and Ser96H, and is in van der Waals contact with Tyr100iH. The 3H -pyrimidone base is hydrogen-bonded to His35H, and is in contact with Trp33H. Three water molecules are located at the interface between the bases and the Fab residues. Hydrogen bonds involving these water molecules also contribute to Fab recognition of the dT(6-4)T bases. The sugar-phosphate backbone connecting the bases is surrounded by residues His27dL, Tyr32L, Ser92L, Trp33H, and Ser58H, but is not hydrogen-bonded to these residues.

Introduction
Exposure to the ultraviolet component of sunlight causes DNA damage which leads to mutation, cell death, and neoplastic transformation (Setlow, 1978). These photo-damaged DNAs include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, (6-4) photoproducts (Figure 1), and Dewar isomers (Mitchell & Nairn, 1989). In mammalian cells, (6-4) photoproducts are removed from nuclei at least tenfold more effectively than cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. This implies that cells can complete DNA replication with cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers still present but not with (6-4) photoproducts (Szymkowski et al., 1993). (6-4) Photoproducts cause base-substitution, 3H thymine-tocytosine substitution at the dT(6-4)T site, and cytosine-to-thymine substitution at the dT(6-4)C site, more frequently than cyclobutane pyrimidine

Monoclonal antibodies speci®c for (6-4) photoproducts have been established for detection of photo-damaged DNA. Nikaido and colleagues have established a variety of monoclonal antibodies against cyclobutane, (6-4), and Dewar pyrimidine dimers (Mori et al., 1991; Matsunaga et al., 1993), and applied these antibodies to the quanti®cation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts (Ishizaki et al., 1992). Among these antibodies, anti-(6-4) photoproduct antibodies of 64M-2, 64M-3, and 64M-5 were established simultaneously from the BALB/c mice by immunization with ultraviolet-irradiated single-stranded calf thymus DNA (Mori et al., 1991), and their ligand selectivities (Kobayashi et al., 1998a) as well as their epitopes (Torizawa et al., 1998) have been analyzed. Here, we report the crystal structure of the Fab fragment of the 64M-2 antibody, which is complexed with the dT(6-4)T ligand, in order to elucidate structural recognition of (6-4) photoproducts by the antibody.

Results
Overall structure of the 64M-2 Fab dimers. Hence (6-4) photoproducts are more mutagenic than cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (LeClerc et al., 1991), and are suggested to play crucial roles in mutagenic and biological effects caused by ultraviolet light (Mitchell & Nairn, 1989). De®ciencies in the repair of DNA photoproducts in humans lead to hereditary disease known as xeroderma pigmentosum (Hanawalt et al., 1979). Xeroderma pigmentosum patients are extremely sensitive to sunlight and have an approximately 103-fold higher chance of developing skin cancer (Setlow, 1978). The enzymes that repair cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers have been studied extensively, and the three-dimensional structural information has been obtained for endonuclease V from bacteriophage T4 (Morikawa et al., 1992; Vassylyev et al., 1995) as the base-excision repair enzyme and for photolyase from Escherichia coli (Park et al., 1995) and Anacystis nidulans (Tamada et al., 1997) as the photoreactivating repair enzyme. (6-4) Photolyase, as the photoreactivating enzyme, has been isolated from Drosophila melanogaster (Todo et al., 1993), characterized (Kim et al., 1994), and investigated for its biological properties (Zhao et al., 1997). However, no structural information either on (6-4) photoproducts or on proteins interacting with them has been obtained by crystallographic means. Anti-nucleic acid antibodies are induced in autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Stollar, 1992), and also by direct injection of nucleic acids. The structures of antibody Fab fragments complexed with nucleic acids have been determined for anti-single-stranded DNA antibody BV04-01 (Herron et al., 1991) and for anti-singlestranded RNA antibody Jel103 (Pokkuluri et al., 1994). The crystal structure of the 64M-2 antibody Fab complexed with the dT(6-4)T ligand was deterÊ Ê mined at 2.4 A (1 A  0.1 nm) resolution by the molecular replacement method, as described in Materials and Methods. The R-factor is 0.199 (Rfree Ê Ê value of 0.279) for 10 A-2.4 A diffraction data. The statistics of the diffraction data collection and structure re®nement are summarized in Table 1. Continuous and clear electron densities were obtained for the Fab except for the loop region of Thr133H and Thr134H that are exposed to the protein surface of the CH1 domain. Electron densities in the vicinity of Gln38L are shown in Figure 2(a). The mean coordinate error was estimated to be Ê 0.29 A with the method described by Luzzati (1952). The main-chain torsion angles were analyzed with the program PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and their statistics are listed in Table 1. Two non-glycine residues, Val51L, and Lys99H, are in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Val51L, with f  70  and c  À 58  , is placed as a second residue in a g-turn. Second residues in g-turns adopt unfavorable torsion angles (Milner-White et al., 1988), and are remarked for residue 51 of the complementarity-determining region (CDR) L2 of the antibodies (Mizutani et al., 1995). This L2 turn is also termed as a distorted type IH turn (Wilmot & Thornton, 1990). Lys99H with f  123  and c  À 80  is surrounded by aromatic side-chains of Tyr98H, Tyr100H, and Tyr100iH, and its main-chain conformation is attributable to this packed structural environment. The VL domain of the 64M-2 antibody (IgG2a with k light-chains) is related to the VH domain by a 171  rotation around the pseudo-dyad axis (Figure 3). In a total of 127 van der Waals contacts between these domains, the framework 2 region of

The map is calculated with phases from a model without residues from 37L to 41L, from 84L to 87L, from 38H to 45H, and from 88H to 91H, and are contoured at 2.5 times the rms values of electron densities. The stick representation of residues around Gln38L is superposed on the map. (b) The dT(6-4)T ligand and its vicinity. The map is calculated with phases from a model without the dT(6-4)T molecule and adjacent Fab residues, contoured at three times the rms values of electron densities. The re®ned structures for the dT(6-4)T and nearby side-chains are superposed on the map. T6 and T4 represent the 5H -thymine and 3H -pyrimidone bases, respectively. O3H represents the 3H oxygen atom (O13H ) of the 3H -deoxyribose. Figures 2 through 5 were produced using program TURBO-FRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1995).

the VL domain forms 65 contacts, and L1, L2, and L3 regions account for 9, 15, and 15 contacts, respectively. Most of the VH residues involved in the VL-VH interactions are located in framework 2 (41 contacts) and H3 (58 contacts) regions of the VH domain. In the VL-VH interface, four hydrogen bonds are formed; two between the side-chains of Glu34L and Arg95H, and two between the sidechains of Gln38L and Gln39H (Figure 2(a)). Glu34L and Arg95H are involved in the construction of the binding pocket as well as in the VL-VH interface. Gln38L and Gln39H are highly conserved among antibodies, and hydrogen bonds between the corresponding residues are reported in the Fab structures (Novotny & Haber, 1985). Two pairs of aromatic residues, Tyr49L-Tyr100H and Tyr36LTrp103H, also contribute to the stabilization of the VL-VH interface, through plane-normal aromatic-

aromatic interactions of side-chains (Burley & Petsko, 1985). The CL domain is related to the CH1 domain by a 172  rotation around the pseudo-dyad axis. Among a total of 136 van der Waals contacts between these domains, 19 contacts are formed between Gln124L and Tyr122H. Three hydrogen bonds are formed; between the Asn137L and Ser190H side-chains, between the Ser162L sidechain and the Pro175H main-chain, and between the Ser176L and Ser188H side-chains. The variable domains are arranged nearly colinear with the constant domains. Hence, the elbow angle relating the VL/VH pseudo-dyad to the CL/CH1 pseudo-dyad is 174  . This value is within the range observed for Fabs with k lightchains (Padlan, 1994). Five out of 23 proline residues are in the cis conformation; they are

The L2 loop from 50L to 52L is classi®ed into the type 1 strucÊ ture, with a small rms difference of 0.15 A from the 4-4-20 Fab structure. The L3 loop from 91L to 96L is classi®ed into the type 3 structure with an Ê rms difference of 0.41 A from the HyHEL-5 Fab structure (Cohen et al., 1996). The H1 loop from 26H to 32H is classi®ed into the type 1 structure, Ê with an rms difference of 0.38 A from the 4-4-20 Fab structure. The H2 loop from 52aH to 55H is most similar to that of the HyHEL-5 Fab that has the type 2 structure, despite of a large rms differÊ ence of 0.99 A. The H3 region comprised of 16 residues from 92H to 104H is stabilized mainly by electrostatic interactions between the Arg94H and Asp101H side-chains and also by a hydrogen bond between the Trp103H side-chain and the Leu100kH O atom. This H3 structure has a b-bulge at Asp101H, and is classi®ed into the bulged torso conformation (Morea et al., 1998), as observed for the 4D5 Fv (Eigenbrot et al., 1993). The main-chain rms difference between the 64M-2 Fab and 4D5 Fv structures Ê is 1.65 A for residues from 92H to 104H, and is Ê 0.44 A for the torso regions from 92H to 95H and from 100jH to 104H. This indicates that the torso regions have a limited repertoire of conformations while the apices of the loops have various conformations ascribable to the same H3 classi®cation (Morea et al., 1998). The residue at position 100jH contributes both to the H3 conformation and to the shape of the antigen-binding pocket (Morea et al., 1998). The small side-chain of Ala100jH points towards the L2 loop and is in contact with the side-chains of Leu46L and Tyr49L, each adjacent to the L2 residues. When residues 100iH and 100jH are not packed against L3 residues, a deep binding site is formed in the space left by these residues (Morea et al., 1998). In the 64M-2 Fab, residues 100iH and 100jH are not packed against the L3 region, and the antigen-binding site shows a wide depressed shape.

715 The 5H -deoxyribose is in the C3H -endo conformation, and the 3H -deoxyribose is nearly planar. The torsion angle g around the C14H -C15H bond of the 3H -deoxyribose, which characterizes the orientation of O15H relative to the deoxyribose ring, is in the sc (gauche) range (Saenger, 1984). The phosphodiester torsion angles z (C3H -O3H -P-O15H ) and a (O3H -P-O15H -C15H ) are in the Àsc (gaucheÀ) range. These torsion angles are close to the reported values of z  À 76  and a  À 96  for the C3H -endo and C2H -exo conformation in the NMR analysis of dT(6-4)T (Taylor et al., 1988b). Antigen-binding site Figure 4 shows the antigen-binding site of the 64M-2 Fab. The pocket accommodating the bound Ê Ê dT(6-4)T ligand is about 15 A long, 10 A wide, and Ê 8 A deep, and is constructed mainly by basic and aromatic residues. The basic residues of His35H and Arg95H and the aromatic residues of Phe89L and Trp47H are located at the bottom of the pocket. The aromatic residues of His27dL, Tyr32L, Phe32H, Trp33H, Tyr52H, Tyr98H, and Tyr100iH form the side-wall of the pocket. The bound ligand is surrounded by the CDRs except L2. A total of 14 CDR residues are involved in binding to the ligand. Among 82 contacts between the ligand and CDR residues, the H1 and H3 residues account for 29 and 23 contacts, respectively. The 5H -thymine and 3H -pyrimidone bases are located in the vicinities of the H3 and H1 residues, respectively. The 5H -deoxyribose, 3H -deoxyribose, and phosphate group are located in the vicinities of the L1, H2, and L3 residues, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the interactions among the ligand, Fab, and water molecules. The ligand forms three hydrogen bonds with the Fab residues, as shown in Figure 5. The 5H -thymine base is in interaction with Arg95H, Ser96H, Gly97H, and Tyr100iH, with its O2 atom hydro-

Structure of the (6-4) photoproduct The 64M-2 Fab was cocrystallized with the dT(6-4)T ligand, the deoxythymidine dimer with the (6-4) photolesion. The dT(6-4)T molecule consists of a thymine-pyrimidone adduct of modi®ed 5H -thymine and 3H -pyrimidone bases, 5H -deoxyribose, 3H -deoxyribose, and a connecting phosphate group (Figure 1(b)), and its closed circular structure is clearly discernible in the electron density, as shown in Figure 2(b). The thymine-pyrimidone base moiety of dT(64)T has a chemical structure of 5-hydroxy-6-4H -(5H methylpyrimid-2H -one)-dihydrothymine, and its crystal structure has been reported by Karle et al. (1969). The rms difference between the bound and Ê reported base moiety structures is 0.16 A. Hence the base moiety of dT(6-4)T adopts almost the same structure as the crystal of the thymine-pyrimidone bases. The angle between the 5H -thymine plane de®ned as a mean plane for the six-membered 5H -thymine atoms and the 3H -pyrimidone plane similarly de®ned is 99  , indicating that these planes are nearly perpendicular to each other. The 5H -thymine ring is in the half-chair conformation in which the C5 atom is placed above the mean plane and the C6 atom below the plane, as shown in Figure 2(b). Both the C5 methyl group and the 3H -pyrimidone ring are axial to the 5H -thymine ring, and are placed opposite to each other, with a (C5 methyl)-C5-C6C14 torsion angle of À164  (Table 2). The 3H -pyrimidone base is nearly planar and its C15 methyl group points toward the 5H -deoxyribose ring. Both the 5H -thymine N1 and 3H -pyrimidone N11 atoms show planar sp2 con®gurations. The 5H -thymine with the glycosidic torsion angle w of À135  is in the anti conformation about the glycosyl bond to the deoxyribose ring, and the 3H -pyrimidone with that of À71  is in the high-anti (-sc) conformation (Saenger, 1984).

(b) The binding site pocket is shown by omitting the ligand from the drawing.

gen-bonded to the Arg95H Ne atom, and with its N3 atom hydrogen-bonded to the Ser96H carbonyl O atom. The 5H -thymine base is placed nearly perpendicular to the Tyr100iH side-chain, accounting for six contacts. The 3H -pyrimidone base is in interaction with Trp33H, His35H, and Arg95H, and is oriented so as to point its O12 atom toward the inside of the binding pocket. The 3H -pyrimidone base is oriented parallel with the Trp33H sideÊ chain with a ring-to-ring distance of 3.5 A, H accounting for 15 contacts. The 3 -pyrimidone O12 atom is hydrogen-bonded to the His35H Ne2 atom. The His35H Nd1 atom is hydrogen-bonded to the Trp47H Ne1 atom. The Arg95H NZ1 atom is hydrogen-bonded to the Gly91L O atom through two ordered water molecules (Wat179 and Wat86), and the Arg95H O atom is hydrogen-bonded to Wat23 that is also hydrogen-bonded both to the 5H -thymine O4 atom and to the Trp33H amide N atom. The conformations of the side-chains of His35H and Arg95H are attained through these interactions, and these residues contribute to the speci®c recognition of the dT(6-4)T ligand. The 5H -deoxyribose is in interaction with Gly91L and the side-chains of His27dL, Asn28L, and Tyr32L. The side-chain of Tyr32L is nearly parallel with the 5H -deoxyribose ring with ten contacts, and plays a major role in the interaction. The 3H -deoxyribose is in interaction with the side-chains of Ser92L, Leu93L, Trp33H, His35H, Thr50H, and Ser58H. The phosphate group accounts for six contacts with the main-chain atoms of Ser92L and Leu93L. In contrast to the base moiety, which accounts for three hydrogen bonds to the Fab, the deoxyribose and phosphate groups are not directly

hydrogen-bonded to the Fab. Negatively charged phosphate groups are often in interaction with basic side-chains. The dT(6-4)T phosphate group, however, is not located in immediate proximity to basic side-chains.

Discussion
Conformation of the (6-4) photoproduct The (6-4) linkage in the dT(6-4)T structure restricts the conformational ¯exibility of the photoproduct. Hence the dT(6-4)T molecule seems highly rigid as compared with a normal thymidine dimer. The NMR study on the conformation of dT(6-4)T (Rycyna & Alderfer, 1985) proposed the two-state model in which the 3H -deoxyribose ring equilibrates between C3H -endo (60 % occupancy) and C3H -exo (40 %) puckers. The other NMR study (Taylor et al., 1988b) proposed that the 3H -deoxyribose ring is either in an equilibrium between C2H exo (70 %) and C3H -exo (30 %) puckers, or in the single state only adopting a C1H -endo pucker. Kim & Choi (1995) reported a solution structure of the DNA duplex-decamer of d(CGCAT(6-4)TACGC)/ d(GCGTAATGCG). The 3H -deoxyribose of the dT(6-4)T portion is restricted to the C2H -exo conformation. The ¯exibility of the 3H -deoxyribose observed in the segmented dT(6-4)T is not allowed in the DNA duplex-decamer, because of the steric hindrance caused by the adjoining nucleotides and the complementary DNA chain. The 3H -deoxyribose of the bound dT(6-4)T ligand is tightly packed to the Fab surface and is in nearly a planar conformation, although this conformation is generally unfavorable for the deoxyribose (Saenger, 1984).

The planar 3H -deoxyribose of dT(6-4)T bound to the 64M-2 Fab is possibly ®xed in the intermediate between the C3H -endo and C3H -exo conformations. The 5H -deoxyribose of the bound dT(6-4)T is in the C3H -endo conformation, although the deoxyribose of the B-DNA shows the C2H -endo conformation. The conversion of the C2H -endo to the C3H -endo brings adjacent bases closer. Therefore, the C3H endo conformation is ascribable to the formation of the (6-4) linkage. The two NMR studies on the conformation of dT(6-4)T (Rycyna & Alderfer, 1985; Taylor et al., 1988b) proposed that the 5H -deoxyribose ring is in the C3H -endo conformation. The torsion angles a, b, g, d, e, and z along the nucleotide backbone of the 5H -deoxyribose, phosphate, and the 3H -deoxyribose (Table 2) indicate a backbone conformation similar to the standard DNA and RNA structures (Parkinson et al., 1996). The largest difference between the dT(6-4)T and standard structures is noticed for the torsion angle e (C4H -C3H -O3H -P) of the 5H -deoxyribose. The e value of À110  is approximately 35  larger than that of the standard structures, and is also reported for the structural model of dT(6-4)T in solution (Taylor et al., 1988b). This difference corresponds to the rotation angle that

superposes the 3H -pyrimidone ring onto the 5H thymine ring. The glycosidic torsion angles of the 5H -thymine and 3H -pyrimidone are À135  and À71  , respectively, and are close to the reported w values (À138  and À75  ) for the C3H -endo and C2H -exo conformations of the solution structure (Taylor et al., 1988b). These angles are ascribable to the formation of the (6-4) linkage that connects the 5H -thymine perpendicularly to the 3H pyrimidone and brings the 5H -thymine-deoxyribose segment to the high-anti orientation of the 3H -deoxyribose. In the molecular dynamics simulations (Spector et al., 1997), the torsion angles e (À119  ) and w (À143  and À51  ) of the (6-4) photoproduct are larger than those of the native DNA decamer. Fab interaction with (6-4) photoproducts Interactions between proteins and DNAs are often mediated by ordered water molecules forming hydrogen-bonding networks. In the trp repressor-DNA complex (Otwinowski et al., 1988), there are few direct contacts between the protein and the base-pairs of DNA, while three ordered water molecules are intervening between the base-pairs and

the protein side-chains. In the 64M-2 Fab complex, three ordered water molecules are placed in the interface between the Fab and the base moiety of the ligand, and are involved in the intervening hydrogen-bonding network. Wat23 forms hydrogen bonds to the 5H -thymine O4, Arg95H O, and Trp33H amide N atoms. Wat86 is in interaction with the 3H -pyrimidone O12, Gly91L O, and Wat179, which is then hydrogen-bonded to the Arg95H NZ1. Therefore, these three water molecules also contribute to the speci®c recognition of dT(6-4)T. The binding af®nities of single-stranded DNA (6-4) photoproducts of various lengths are reported to be 4.5 Â 106 $ 7.4 Â 109 MÀ1 for the Fab fragment of the highly homologous 64M-5 antibody that shows 96 % VL and 88 % VH sequence identities to the 64M-2 antibody and conserves most of the residues involved in the interaction with the dT(6-4)T ligand (Kobayashi et al., 1998a). Higher af®nities are observed for longer oligonucleotides up to the hexamer containing the dT(6-4)T moiety in its middle, although the af®nity of the octamer becomes virtually identical with that of the hexamer. This indicates that nucleotides on both the sides of dT(6-4)T are recognizable by the 64M-5 antibody. In the 64M-2 Fab complex, conserved Tyr32L of CDR L1 is located in the vicinity of the 5H -deoxyribose (Figures 4 and 5). Ser58H of CDR H2, which corresponds to Thr58H of the 64M-5 antibody, is located near the 3H -deoxyribose. Hence, the L1 region is likely to interact with the 5H side segment of elongated (6-4) photoproducts, and the H2 region with the 3H side segment. When the molecular surface of the 64M-2 Fab is viewed down onto its antigen-binding site, the surface is occupied mostly by positively charged side-chains, as shown in Figure 6. The center of the surface corresponds to the antigen-binding site and shows positive charges at the His35H and Arg95H locations. Near the O5H atom of the bound dT(6-

4)T, the basic side-chains of Lys50L and Arg54L of the L2 region are exposed on the protein surface, and are possibly involved in electrostatic interactions with nearby phosphate groups of the elongated (6-4) photoproducts. Downstream of the H2 region, four lysine residues at 62H, 64H, 66H, and 68H are repeated in the sequence. It has been proposed that the cluster of these lysine residues that are conserved in the 64M-5 antibody would be involved in electrostatic interactions with the elongated (6-4) photoproducts and would help the antibody to guide them to the antigen-binding pocket (Kobayashi et al., 1998b). In the 64M-2 Fab structure, these lysine side-chains adjacent to the H2 loop are placed in the b-strand and are exposed to the solvent region. These positively charged areas in the L2 and H2 regions possibly play important roles in attractive interaction with (6-4) photoproducts. Antigen-binding surface and specificity of the 64M-2 Fab The 64M-2 antibody recognizes (6-4) photoproducts but not normal DNAs, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, or Dewar isomers (Mori et al., 1991). The antigen-binding pocket of the 64M-2 Fab is constructed so as to accommodate nucleotide dimers with (6-4) linked-pyrimidine bases, which are capable of forming speci®c hydrogen bonds to the Fab residues and of placing their 3H -pyrimidone bases parallel with the Trp33H side-chain. In the crystal structure of the cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer cyanoethyl (CE) phosphotriester, d(T[p](CE)T), adjacent thymine bases are folded at the base-linkages (Cadet et al., 1985). The z and g angles for the conformation of sugar-phosphate backbone of the dT(6-4)T molecule complexed with the 64M-2 Fab are in gaucheÀ and gauche ranges, respectively, and are quite different from those of d(T[p](CE)T): both the z and g angles are in a trans

Positive and negative potentials are shown in blue and red, respectively. Six CDRs are indicated with their labels. The dT(6-4)T ligand accommodated in the binding site is drawn as a stick model. T6 and T4 represent the 5H -thymine and 3H pyrimidone bases, respectively. O3H represents the 3H oxygen atom (O13H ) of the 3H -deoxyribose. Well ordered water molecule Wat23 is also shown as a red ball. Positive charges are observed around the bound dT(6-4)T ligand: Arg95H and His35H are located at the binding pocket, Lys50L and Arg54L are possibly near the 5H side segment of elongated (6-4) photoproducts, and Lys62H and Lys64H are possibly near the 3H side. The Figure was produced using the program GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).

range. When the cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer portion (Figure 1(c)) from the doublestranded DNA structure (Vassylyev et al., 1995; PDB entry: 1vas) is superposed onto the location on the bound dT(6-4)T, the folded bases result in a crash at the Trp33H side-chain. Therefore, these cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimer molecules would not be accommodated in the antigen-binding site. Dewar isomers (Figure 1(d)) are produced from (6-4) photoproducts by irradiation of 313 nm ultraviolet (Taylor & Cohrs, 1987), and the ¯ap angle between the two mean planes of the four-membered rings in the bent 3H Dewar base was reported to be 117  for the solution structure of dT(Dewar)T of thymidylyl-(3H 3 5H )-thymidine (Taylor et al., 1988a). This bent 3H Dewar base would not be properly accommodated in the binding pocket nor placed parallel with the Trp33H side-chain of the 64M-2 Fab. The (6-4) photoproducts each formed from the DNA octamer with the central dipyrimidine site, TT, TC, CT, or CC, are recognized by the 64M-2 antibody (Mori et al., 1991). The af®nity is the highest toward the photoproduct with the central T(6-4)T, and is on the descendent toward the photoproducts of T(6-4)C, C(6-4)C, and C(6-4)T octamers, in that order. In each of these photoproducts, the hydrogen bond acceptors of the C2 carbonyl O atoms in the modi®ed 3H and 5H side bases would play a major role in the interaction with Fab. In the case of the C(6-4)T and C(6-4)C photoproducts, an amino group is substituted for the carbonyl O4 atom of the 5H -thymine structure, and no hydrogen atom is bound to the N3 atom

(Figure 1(b)). The substituted amino group would bring short contacts to the Ser96H O atom as well as alterations to hydrogen-bonding to Wat23. The hydrogen-removed N3 atom would form no hydrogen bond with the Ser96H carbonyl O atom. Therefore, the modi®ed 5H -cytosine bases of the C(6-4)T and C(6-4)C photoproducts are major contributors to their decreased af®nities. Furthermore, the absence of the C5 methyl group in the case of the modi®ed 5H -cytosine would contribute to the decreased af®nities of the C(6-4)T and C(6-4)C photoproducts, since the C5 methyl group is involved in van der Waals interaction with the Tyr100iH side-chain. On the other hand, the 3H -pyrimidone bases of the T(6-4)C and C(6-4)C photoproducts affect less their binding af®nities (Mori et al., 1991). In each of these structures, an amino group is substituted for the C5 hydroxy group of the modi®ed 5H -thymine or 5H -cytosine (Figure 1(b)), and is likely to impose no considerable alteration to the photoproduct structure nor to the interaction with Fab. Though the C15 methyl group of 3H -pyrimidone of the bound dT(6-4)T is exposed for the most part to the solvent region, it is partly in contact with the 5H -deoxyribose and phosphate groups. Hence in each of the T(6-4)C and C(6-4)C photoproducts the hydrogen atom substitution for the C15 methyl group would bring only a small decrease in the af®nity. Comparison of the 64M-2 Fab with nucleotide-binding antibody Fabs As for the structural studies on the antibodynucleic acid interactions, the crystal structures of the Jel103 Fab speci®c to single-stranded poly(rI)

720 (Pokkuluri et al., 1994) and of the BV04-01 Fab speci®c to single-stranded poly(dT) (Herron et al., 1991) have been reported. Although these Fabs are bound to the different nucleotide ligands, common characteristics are noticed for the recognition of the ligands. The guanine base of rGDP bound to the Jel103 Fab as well as the second thymine base of deoxythymine trimer (dT)3 bound to the BV04-01 Fab is positioned in parallel and in contact with the side-chain of Tyr32L of CDR L1, and is hydrogen-bonded to Ser 91L of CDR L3. This similarity in the recognition is ascribable to the high identity (97 %) in the VL sequences whose light-chain CDR residues are different only in the 96L position. Though the 64M-2 Fab also shows a high identity in the VL sequence, 92 % to the Jel103 Fab and 90 % to the BV04-01 Fab, Tyr32L as well as Gly91L corresponding to the Ser91L residues are involved in the interactions with the dT(6-4)T molecule, but are located near the sugar-phosphate backbone instead of the base moiety. The 64M-2 Fab residues in interaction with the base moiety are mostly heavychain CDR residues: H3 residues interact with the 5H -thymine base, and H1 residues with the 3H -pyrimidone base. The VH sequence identities of the 64M-2 Fab to the Jel103 and BV04-01 Fabs are low, 73 % for the former and 41 % for the latter. The Jel103 Fab with the relatively high VH identity has a short H3 loop consisting of seven residues, and its H3 conformation is much different from that of the 64M-2 Fab. The VH sequences of these antibodies possibly contribute to the differentiation in their ligand recognition.

Antibody Fab Complex with dT(6-4)T Photoproduct containing 200 mM NaCl. The puri®ed Fab was concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). Crystallization of the 64M-2 Fab complexed with dT(6-4)T The dT(6-4)T ligand with the (6-4) photolesion was synthesized as described (Iwai et al., 1996), and the deblocked product was isolated by reversed-phase chromatography (Kobayashi et al., 1998a). The protein solution containing 0.2 mM puri®ed 64M-2 Fab and 0.25 mM dT(6-4)T was subjected to crystallization attempts in a dark room at 20  C through the hangingdrop vapor-diffusion method, using a reservoir solution containing 14-18 % (w/v) PEG 8000, 0.1 M Hepes-Na or Tris-HCl (pH 7.5-8.4), and 10 mM NiCl2. Crystallization drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein and reservoir solutions. Crystals in the shape of hexagonal plate appeared in a few days and grew to mature sizes of 0.75 mm Â 0.30 mm Â 0.10 mm in a week. These crystals Ê diffract to 2.4 A resolution and belong to space group Ê Ê C2, with unit cell dimensions of a  144.5 A, b  48.1 A, Ê c  77.9 A, and b  104.7  . One Fab-dT(6-4)T complex exists in a crystallographic asymmetric unit, with the Ê crystal volume per unit mass value of 2.91 A3/Da and the solvent content of 0.58 (v/v). Diffraction data collection The crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution containing 10-17 % PEG 400, 18 % PEG 8000, 10 mM NiCl2, and 0.1 M Hepes-Na (pH 7.5), and then into a solution containing 17 % PEG 400, 18 % PEG 8000 for a few seconds. The crystals were mounted in nylon loops and ¯ash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected from three crystals using the Imaging-Plate (Fuji) area detector specially built by Y.S., equipped with a copper rotating-anode X-ray generator (Rigaku) operated at 50 kV and 100 mA and with a Pt-coated double-focussing mirror. For each diffraction frame, an exposure was performed for 3000 seconds per 2  oscillation. Data sets were processed into intensities using program DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski, 1993). The data collection statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure determination and refinement The crystal structure was determined by the moleculer replacement method implemented in program X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992). The structure of the Jel103 Fab with a g2b heavy-chain (Pokkuluri et al., 1994) was used as a search model, since it showed high sequence identities of 92 % in VL and of 73 % in VH to the 64M-2 Fab with a g2a heavy-chain (Morioka et al., 1998). The molecular replacement solution was obtained for a structural model with an elbow angle of 180  , which is larger by 40  than that of the Jel103 Fab. The highest Ê value obtained in the rotation search using an 8-4 A data set was 0.31 for Eulerian angles of 14.98  , 42.50  , and 1.14  , and was 1.8 times larger than the second highest. The subsequent translation search placed the rotationsearched model at the coordinate of 0.083, 0.000, and 0.167. At this stage the crystallographic R-factor was 0.41 Ê for the 8-4 A data. After the rigid-body re®nement with X-PLOR, the CH1 domain from the 26-10 Fab bearing a g2a heavy-chain (Jeffrey et al., 1993) is substituted into

Materials and Methods
Preparation of the 64M-2 Fab Hybridoma cell line 64M-2 was grown in D-MEM medium (Nissui) containing 5 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The supernatant of the hybridoma culture was concentrated by an ultra®ltration apparatus (Millipore), and resultant antibody 64M-2 was puri®ed on an Af®Gel Protein A column (Bio-Rad). The Fab fragment was prepared by incubating the antibody (5 mg/ml) with papain (Sigma) for two hours at 37  C in 75 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 75 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 5 mM NaN3. The enzyme/substrate ratio was 1:100 (w/w), and Cys-HCl was added to a ®nal concentration of 20 mM. The papain cleavage was stopped by incubating the reaction mixture in 25 mM N-ethylmaleimide for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The mixture was then dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl. The dialysate was loaded onto a Mono-Q anionexchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl. The ¯owthrough Fab fraction was loaded onto a Mono-S cationexchange column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) containing 50 mM NaCl, and eluted with a 50 mM-400 mM NaCl gradient. The largest peak-fraction eluted around 250 mM NaCl and was subsequently applied to a Superdex 200 gel-®ltration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2)

Antibody Fab Complex with dT(6-4)T Photoproduct the model. The substituted model was further re®ned through simulated-annealing from 3000 K to 300 K. Ê The R-factor was dropped to 0.30 against 8.0-3.0 A data. The model was rebuilt using the program TURBOFRODO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1995) and re¯ections Ê Ê between 10 A and 2.5 A were gradually incorporated into the data set. After a few cycles of manual rebuilding and simulated annealing re®nements, individual B-factors were re®ned Ê and the R-factor dropped to 0.27 (8.0-2.5 A). Ordered water molecules clearly observed in electron-density maps were incorporated. Distinctive densities corresponding to the dT(6-4)T ligand were clearly discernible in the pocket surrounded by the CDR residues. The structure for the T(6-4)T bases was derived from the crystal structure of 5-hydroxy-6-4H -(5H -methylpyrimid-2H one)-dihydrothymine (Karle et al., 1969), and was built into the dT(6-4)T model. The structural parameters for the deoxyribose and phosphate groups were adopted from the standard DNA conformation reported by Parkinson et al. (1996). The structural model ®nally re®ned includes one Fab molecule with 434 residues except for Thr133H and Thr134H, one dT(6-4)T molecule, and 360 water molecules. Pairwise atomic contacts were calculated with program CONTACSYM (Sheriff, 1993) to examine atomic contacts using the extended atom radii (Gelin & Karplus, 1979). Re®nement statistics are also summarized in Table 1.
