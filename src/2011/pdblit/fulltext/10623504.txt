[33] Probing the Ubiquitin/Proteasome System with Ornithine Decarboxylase, a UbiquitinIndependent Substrate
By MARTIN A. HOYT, MINGSHENG ZHANG , and PHILIP COFFINO
Abstract

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is an unusual proteasome substrate-- ubiquitin conjugation plays no part in its turnover. It can therefore be used as a probe to distinguish proteasomemediated actions that do or do not depend on the activity of the ubiquitin system. A 37 residue region of ODC suffices for proteasome interactions, and within this sequence functionally critical residues have been identified. Because no posttranslational modifications are required for substrate preparation, ODC and derived constructs can be readily generated as substrates for either in vitro or in vivo studies. This chapter describes methodologies that allow the use of ODC as a reporter to examine the ubiquitinproteasome system, both in reconstituted in vitro systems and in living cells.
Introduction

Ornithine decarboxylase is degraded by the proteasome, but ubiquitin conjugation plays no role in this process. ODC is an enzyme required for polyamine biosynthesis. Proteasome degradation is an important element of its complex regulation. The protein has several characteristics that make it a favorable experimental substrate for studying proteasome action. 1. Active substrates are easily prepared without need for performing a complex series of enzymatic transfers of ubiquitin. 2. A small domain of ODC suffices as a degradation tag and functions autonomously upon transfer to other proteins. 3. The tag is conserved and recognized among diverse eukaryotes.

4. Welldeveloped methods are available to ascertain specificity, as critical residues of the tag have been described. 5. Both in vivo and in vitro systems for studying ODC degradation have been described. 6. In vitro degradation can be performed with biochemically pure components. 7. Because ubiquitin conjugation is not involved, ODC turnover can be used to evaluate proteasome function within the more global ubiquitin/proteasome system. The proteasome targeting signal of ODC consists of a conserved 37 amino acid Cterminal sequence (cODC) that is intrinsic to the primary sequence of ODC (Fig. 1). This degradation tag functions autonomously and can be appended to other proteins, making them labile. Although cODC has autonomous function, its affinity for the proteasome is enhanced about 10fold when a second protein, antizyme (AZ), associates with ODC (Zhang et al., 2003). Antizyme dissociates the ODC homodimer (the enzymatically active form) and forms an ODC:antizyme heterodimer (reviewed in Coffino, 2001). This rearrangement of ODC quaternary structure makes cODC more accessible. Antizyme is a physiologic regulator of ODC activity and abundance and is the effector element of a feedback system that controls cellular polyamines, the downstream products of ODC activity. Antizyme is encoded by an mRNA of unusual structure, consisting of a short ORF that overlaps a second ORF encoding the bulk of the protein; the second ORF lacks an initiation codon and is encoded by a þ1 reading frame with respect to the first (Matsufuji et al., 1995). The protein therefore requires translational frameshifting for its decoding. Superphysiologic levels of polyamines enhance the efficiency of frameshifting at a specific site of the mRNA, increasing production of the protein. Antizyme binds to ODC, increasing its affinity for the proteasome and thus accelerating its degradation. Because ODC is the initial and ratelimiting enzyme in

the polyamine biosynthesis pathway, cellular polyamines are restored to normal by this means. The feedback system does not depend on allostery to control ODC enzyme but instead uses a combination of translational frameshifting and targeted degradation. This elaborate mechanism is conserved from fungi to mammals. For both in vivo and in vitro studies, ODC provides a convenient means to distinguish between ubiquitindependent and independent mechanisms of proteasomemediated proteolysis. Notably, measurements of ODC turnover allow investigators to differentiate whether mutations, treatments, or biologic states impair proteasome function specifically or instead alter properties of the ubiquitinproteasome pathway that are external to proteasomes.
Structural Elements of Ornithine Decarboxylase and Antizyme Important for Degradation

The cisacting residues of cODC critical for directing degradation have been identified. They function in native ODC and also in otherwise stable proteins that have been destabilized by fusion to cODC. By mutating these elements, one can test whether the ODCspecific degradation pathway is operating as intended in the experimental system under investigation. Varying the cODC sequence also offers opportunities for systematically manipulating substrate targeting. Figure 2 shows an alignment of the Cterminal region of ODC proteins from diverse vertebrate species. Two subregions of cODC contain a high density of invariant residues. The first of these consists of residues 440­446 of the mouse enzyme. However, scanning mutagenesis has shown that among these, only Cys441 is intolerant to mutation (H. Chen and P. Coffino, unpublished data); even the conservative Cys441Ser mutation strongly stabilizes ODC (Hoyt, 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). The second

[33]

subregion that shows invariance is at the very Cterminal end. Serial truncations that remove the last few amino acids progressively stabilize ODC, and removing the last five suffices for full stabilization (Ghoda et al., 1992). These effects of Cys441 mutation and Cterminal truncation are hallmarks of the ubiquitinindependent ODC degradation pathway (Hoyt, 2003). The 37 terminal native residues of ODC provide an autonomous degradation domain when fused to the C terminus of other proteins. Those tested include green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Li et al., 1998), luciferase (Leclerc et al., 2000), Ura3 (M. Hoyt and P. Coffino, unpublished data), and dihydrofolate reductase (Loetscher et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 2003). Additionally, Trypanosoma brucei ODC is a stable protein about 70% identical to the mammalian enzyme in its core sequence, but lacking a region that corresponds to cODC. Grafting cODC to the end of T. brucei ODC labilizes the enzyme (Ghoda et al., 1989, 1990). Antizymes actually consist of a conserved gene family whose individual members have been independently conserved among eukaryotes (Ivanov et al., 2000). Three distinct antizyme orthologs are found in mammals. Antizymes 1 and 2 are expressed ubiquitously; antizyme 3 is expressed only at a specific stage of sperm cell development. Although antizymes 1 and 2 both bind to ODC and inhibit its enzymatic activity, antizyme 1 accelerates ODC degradation by proteasomes much more effectively (Chen et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 1999). Antizyme 1 from Rattus norvegicus, which has 227 amino acids, has been dissected to reveal its working parts. Residues 120­227 are sufficient for ODC binding, but are insufficient to direct degradation (Li and Coffino, 1994). This additionally requires sequence information present in amino acids 70­119. Mixing and matching bits of antizymes 1 and 2 revealed that the capacity to strongly promote degradation in vitro maps to residues 131 and 145 of antizyme 1 (Chen et al., 2002).
Examples of the Experimental Use of ODC/AZ

GFPcODC: A Labilized Reporter of Temporal Changes in Gene Expression The green fluorescent protein of Aequorea victoria is widely used as a reporter of transcription. Because GFP is a stable protein, its level does not track the rate of GFP synthesis, but instead provides a record of its accumulation over time. A labile reporter would more closely approximate synthetic rate and provide acute information about timedependent changes in synthesis. Appending cODC to the GFP carboxy terminus (Li et al., 1998) labilized the reporter, creating a system for tracking acute changes in gene expression.

Cyclin D1: A Target of AZ Degradation The observation that AZ expression inhibits the growth of some cells prompted an examination of AZassociated changes in cyclin levels. AZ was shown to associate noncovalently with cyclin D1. Using purified components, AZ was found to direct cyclin D1 degradation by proteasomes without the involvement of ubiquitylation, an observation confirmed in vivo by showing that AZ induction accelerated the turnover of a mutant form of cyclin D1 that cannot be ubiquitylated (Newman et al., 2004). Ubistatin: Discerning UbiquitinSpecific Proteasome Targeting A chemical library screen revealed a series of compounds that inhibited the proteolysis of cyclin B and ubiquitinated Sic1 by purified proteasomes. To determine the specificity of the inhibitors, their activity was investigated using ODC as a proteasome substrate. The compounds proved much less potent for the ubiquitinindependent substrate, supporting the conclusion that the inhibitory effect was directed at ubiquitin conjugates (Verma et al., 2004). ODC as a Platform for Investigating a cisActing Proteasome Inhibitory Sequence The Epstein­Barr virus EBNA1 protein contains a tract of 60­300 residues consisting entirely of glycines and alanines. When embedded in diverse proteins, it inhibits their degradation by the proteasome. The question of whether it impairs ubiquitin conjugation or acts instead on downstream events was resolved by embedding a glycinealanine sequence within ODC (Zhang and Coffino, 2004). Its action was shown to be independent of ubiquitin conjugation; it instead functions in the proteasome by interrupting substrate insertion (Zhang and Coffino, 2004).
Methods for In Vivo Degradation of ODC

Pulse­Chase or Immunoblot Analysis of PolyamineInduced Turnover of ODC in Cultured Mammalian Cells One of the simplest means to assess the capacity for ODC turnover in cultured cells is to measure the change in ODC protein or enzymatic activity following polyamine administration. As discussed earlier, the addition of exogenous polyamines stimulates antizyme synthesis, resulting in accelerated ODC turnover. Polyamine administration has no apparent

404

effect on the rate of ODC synthesis in cultured mammalian cells (van Daalen Wetters et al., 1989). The turnover of ODC in mammalian cells can be measured directly using pulse­chase analysis (Ghoda et al., 1989; van Daalen Wetters et al., 1989). For this purpose, either the endogenous ODC protein or the ectopically expressed ODC, introduced by transient or stable transfection, can be utilized. Endogenous ODC is normally expressed at very low levels in mammalian cells, sometimes making immunoblot analysis of ODC difficult. Ectopic ODC, expressed from plasmid vectors, confers the advantage of higher expression levels and the possibility of introducing epitope tagged variants. For historical reasons, the mouse (Mus musculus) ODC cDNA (Gupta and Coffino, 1985) is used most often in such vectors, and studies of turnover utilized this ODC. Hereafter, ODC will designate mouse ODC specifically, unless otherwise stated. Due to the extensive homology of the primary peptide sequences, antisera prepared against recombinant mouse ODC react equally well with ODCs from other mammalian species. For pulse­chase analysis, approximately 1.25 Â 105 cells are transferred in 200 l of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum to each well of a 24well tissue culture plate (Falcon 353047). Putrescine is added to a final concentration of 500 M, and the cells are cultured for 4­24 h in the presence of the polyamine. Exogenously added putrescine is converted rapidly to spermidine in vivo by the action of the biosynthetic enzyme spermidine synthase. Putrescine is added instead of spermidine because polyamine oxidases present in fetal bovine serum act on the latter polyamine, producing toxic products. If spermidine must be used, then horse serum, which lacks polyamine oxidases, is substituted for fetal bovine serum. The cells are washed three times with phosphate buffered saline, followed by the addition of DMEM lacking methionine and containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells are incubated for 15 min in the methioninefree medium, followed by the addition of 50 Ci of L[35S] methionine. The cells are labeled for 1 h at 37 , washed again three times with phosphatebuffered saline, and resuspended in complete medium containing 500 M putrescine and 5 mM methionine to initiate the chase. After chase periods of 1.5, 3, and 6 h, cells are washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline, lysed on ice for 5 min in 400 l of RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and frozen at ­80 . After one freeze­thaw cycle, the lysates are clarified by centrifugation (14,000g), and trichloroacetic acidinsoluble radioactivity is determined. The amount of labeled ODC in each lysate is analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by separation by SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.

Example: Comparing the Effect on ODC of AZ1 and AZ2 In vitro experiments have demonstrated that although AZ1 promotes ODC turnover, AZ2 does not. To compare the activities of the two paralogs in vivo, ODC, AZ1, and AZ2 ORFs are inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(À) for ODC and pcDNA3.1(þ) for the AZs (both vectors from Invitrogen). To facilitate Western blot analysis of expressed proteins, the Flag epitope tag (AspTyrLysAspAspAspAsp Lys) is inserted immediately following the initial methionine of the native protein sequence in these constructs. CHOK1 cells are transiently transfected with mammalian expression plasmids encoding FlagODC, FlagAZ1, FlagAZ2, or combinations of these using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Control cells are transfected with empty vector, and empty vector DNA is added as needed to make total DNA concentrations identical for each transfection condition. After incubation for 24 h, cells are harvested, and the FlagODC, FlagAZ1, and FlagAZ2 are analyzed by Western blot using the antiFlag M2 monoclonal (Sigma) as the primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody, and ECL (Amersham Biosciences) for immunodetection. CHO cells are transfected for expression of ODC, AZ1, or AZ2 and for coexpression of ODC with AZ1 or AZ2, as indicated (Fig. 3). Each of the three Flagtagged proteins is detected following transfection. Adjacent lanes represent duplicate independently transfected cultures. For coexpression with ODC, each of the AZs is transfected using a series of 10fold dilutions of DNA. Transfections for AZ2 are carried out with four times more DNA than corresponding transfections for AZ1 to partially compensate for the higher expression level reproducibly observed with the latter. AZ1 induces degradation of ODC, as does AZ2. Transfection with 0.1 g FlagAZ1 DNA (lane 5) and 4.0 g FlagAZ2 DNA (lane 7) resulted in similar levels of the FlagAZs and both reduced FlagODC to an undetectable level. At a further 10fold reduction of transfecting DNA [0.01 g FlagAZ1 DNA (lane 6) and 0.4 g FlagAZ2 DNA (lane 8)] FlagAZ1 completely suppressed FlagODC but FlagAZ2 did so only partially. At further 10fold dilution (lane 9), FlagAZ2 had no apparent effect on FlagODC. These results imply that AZ2 has the capacity to induce ODC turnover in vivo, but is less potent than AZ1. Pulse­Chase Analysis of ODC in Yeast Cells The ubiquitinindependent degradation of mouse ODC in yeast cells has been well characterized (Hoyt et al., 2003). All the structural requirements for ODC degradation are conserved in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,

FIG. 3. Both AZ1 and AZ2 induce degradation of ODC in cultured cells, but the former is more potent. Both AZ1 and AZ2 cause degradation of ODC in cultured cells. CHO cells were transfected for expression of ODC, AZ1, or AZ2 and for coexpression of ODC with AZ1 or AZ2, as indicated. Adjacent lanes represent duplicate independently transfected cultures. For coexpression with ODC, each of the AZs was transfected using a series of 10fold dilutions of DNA. Each of the transfected proteins was Flag tagged at the N terminus and expression was visualized by Western blotting with an antiFlag antibody. Transfections for AZ2 were carried out with four times more DNA than corresponding transfections for AZ1 to partially compensate for the higher expression level reproducibly observed with the latter.

making mouse ODC an excellent probe of proteasome function in this fungus. Mouse ODC can be expressed using any number of existing yeast vectors designed for the heterologous expression of proteins in S. cerevisiae. We have found a set of vectors designed by Mumberg et al. (1995) ideal for this purpose. In particular, the ODC coding region expressed from vectors containing the ADH1 promoter results in easily detectable levels of mature ODC protein with a halflife of 5­10 min in yeast cells. The following protocol, adapted from that of Suzuki and Varshavsky (1999), can be used to measure ODC turnover in yeast cells. Yeast transformants expressing ODC are grown to mid-logarithmic growth phase (OD600 $0.5 to 1.0) in SD medium (Guthrie and Fink, 1991) lacking the appropriate components to maintain selection for the transforming plasmid. A 10ml culture volume typically provides enough cells for the collection of three or four time points during the chase period. Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 2000g for 3 min at room temperature, and the growth medium is discarded. The cells are washed twice by resuspension in 1 ml of SD medium lacking methionine (SD­Met) and transferred into a 1.5ml microcentrifuge tube. The cells are incubated for 1 min at 30 in SD­Met and collected by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge.

[33]

For labeling, the cells are resuspended in 0.4 ml of SD­Met followed by the addition of 200 Ci of L[35S]methionine. A L[35S]methionine and 35 35 35 L[ S]cysteine mixture (Expre S S protein labeling mixture, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) also works well for this purpose. Metabolic labeling is carried out for 5 min at 30 . Following the labeling period, the cells are collected by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, and the labeling medium is removed. The chase period is initiated by resuspending the cells in 0.4 ml of SD medium containing 10 mM methionine, 1 mM cysteine (if the labeling mixture is used), and 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide. For each time point during the chase period, a 0.1ml sample of the cell suspension is collected and transferred to a 2ml screwcap tube containing 0.7 ml of ice cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 0.5 ml of 0.5mm glass beads. The cells are disrupted by four pulses of 30 s duration at the maximum speed setting in a Minibeadbeater (Biospec Products), with cooling on ice between pulses. Alternatively, cells can be lysed using a benchtop vortexer for four pulses of 1 min duration with cooling on ice between pulses. Following the chase period, the cell lysates are cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (13,000g, 10 min at 4 ), and the amount of trichloroacetic acidinsoluble radioactivity is determined. The amount of labeled ODC in each lysate is analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by separation by SDS­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. For lysates containing FLAG epitopetagged ODC, we typically carry out immunoprecipitations using antiFLAG M2 antibodyagarose (Sigma) using 10 l of antibodyagarose conjugate in $0.5 ml of lysate (containing $2.0 Â 107 cpm). Immunoprecipitations are done at 4 for 1­2 h followed by four washes with 1 ml of wash buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS).
Methods for In Vitro Degradation of ODC

AZ1 stimulated degradation of ornithine decarboxylase has been reconstituted in vitro in two forms, using either purified proteasomes or a crude rabbit reticulocyte lysate system as the source of proteasome activity. In the crude lysate, AZ1 usually can drive the degradation of ODC to near completion in 1 h; this degradation system is quite active, reliable, and accessible. In contrast, utilizing a degradation system containing fully defined components requires that AZ1, proteasomes, and labeled ODC each be prepared in a highly purified form, which is more technically demanding. Some special cases, such as quantitative determination of kinetic parameters, require the fully defined biochemical system.

ODC Degradation in Reticulocyte Lysate Slabeled ODC is produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid used for transcription/translation of ODC has a T7 promoter positioned upstream of the ODC ORF. Incubation time for the coupled reaction is usually 90 min at 30 , and the reaction is stopped by chilling the samples on ice. The samples can be stored at ­20 for several weeks. The degradation assay is performed in a 50l volume at 37 and contains 5 l of lysate (which provides both labeled ODC and the proteasomes required for its degradation), 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, an ATP regenerating buffer [2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mM creatine phosphate, and 1.6 mg/ml creatine kinase], and 2 g recombinant AZ1. AZ1 is produced as described under ``ODC Degradation Using Purified Components.'' To document the progress of the degradation reaction, 10l aliquots are removed periodically (typically after 0, 15, 30, and 60 min) and mixed with an equal volume of 2Â SDS­PAGE loading buffer. The fraction of ODC remaining undegraded at each time point is determined by SDS­PAGE and autoradiography. ODC mutated at a single residue (Cys441 ! Ala or Ser) or with a Cterminal 37 amino acid truncation, each of which prevents proteasomemediated ODC degradation, can be used as a negative control. Replacing AZ1 with its dilution buffer, or using proteasomespecific inhibitors, provides additional controls for specificity of the degradation reaction. ODC Degradation Using Purified Components Preparation of 26S Proteasomes. Highly purified proteasomes from bovine red blood cells (a gift from C. Pickart ) or rat liver work equally well in the ODC degradation assay described here. Here a protocol for purification from rat liver, a modification (Zhang et al., 2003) of a published procedure (Reidlinger et al., 1997), is described. Sprague­Dawley rat livers are stored frozen prior to use. All steps should be performed at 0­4 . Rat livers (150 g wet weight) are homogenized in 500 ml buffer A [20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol]. After removing cell debris by centrifugation (RCFmax ¼ 10,410g, 80 min) and filtration through cheesecloth, the sample is further cleared by centrifugation (30,000 rpm in a Beckman Type 35 rotor, RCFmax ¼ 105,000g, 1 h). The supernatant is filtered through Whatman filter paper, and the pH is adjusted to 7.5. The 26S proteasomes are sedimented by centrifugation (35,000 rpm in a Beckman Type 35 rotor, RCFmax ¼ 143,000g, 18 h), and the pellet is

resuspended in 25 ml buffer A without glycerol. The pH is again adjusted to 7.5, if required. The sample is then layered onto a glycerol gradient (15­40% in buffer A, 32 ml/tube Â 6) and centrifuged for 16 h (25,000 rpm in a Beckman SW27 rotor, RCFmax ¼ 110,000g). Fractions are assayed for peptidase activity (using LLVYAMC or another fluorogenic peptide), and those containing peptidase activity are pooled and column fractionation is performed on an AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). Ten milligrams of protein per run is loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Proteasomes are eluted using a linear salt gradient (50­800 mM NaCl, 40 column volumes) in the equilibration buffer. Active fractions are pooled, and 26S proteasomes are collected by centrifugation (31,000 rpm in a Beckman type 35 rotor, RCFmax ¼ 112,000g, 12 h). The purified 26S proteasomes (about 20 mg) are resuspended in 1.5 ml of the aforementioned equilibration buffer with 2 mM ATP and stored at ­80 . The 26S proteasomes are analyzed by SDS­PAGE fractionation and should show a characteristic pattern of protein bands that closely resemble those reported previously for highly purified preparations. Purity and 26S mobility are further confirmed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis and substrate overlays (Glickman et al., 1998). Preparation of AZ1. Escherichia coli strain M15[pREP4] (Stratagene) is transformed with the expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) containing the fulllength rat AZ1 ORF downstream of the 6x histidine tag. Endogenous AZ1 cDNA requires a þ1 translational reading frameshift for expression; a modified ORF containing a single base deletion at the site of frameshifting is therefore used to artificially align the two reading frames. The cells are grown at 37 in 1.0 liter of LB supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and kanamycin (50 mg/liter) to an OD600 of 0.6 to 0.8. The culture is then induced with 1 mM isopropylDthiogalactoside (IPTG) and allowed to grow for another 4 h. Cells are harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min. Cells are resuspended in 50 ml AZ lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.2) with 0.75 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated at 4 for 30 min. The sample is subjected to two cycles of freezing at À80 and thawing at room temperature to ensure cell lysis. The lysate is cleared of cell debris via centrifugation at 12,000g for 30 min at 4 . The clarified supernatant is incubated with 1.0 ml of Talon metal affinity resin (BD Bioscience) that has been equilibrated with AZ lysis buffer. Binding is allowed to proceed for 30 min at 4 with constant rocking. The resin is then batch washed by adding 20 volumes of AZ lysis buffer and centrifugation at 1000g for 3 min. This wash is repeated twice more, and the resin is then packed into a small volume column ($5 ml) and

410

washed with 5 volumes of AZ lysis buffer supplemented with 10 mM imidazole. His6AZ1 is eluted from the Talon resin with 5.0 ml AZ lysis buffer supplemented with 200 mM imidazole. The eluate from the Talon resin is diluted with 2 volumes of AZ lysis buffer lacking NaCl to reduce the concentration of NaCl to 100 mM and is then supplemented with EDTA to 2.0 mM final concentration. Column fractionation is performed on an AKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). The sample is loaded onto a 1.0ml MonoQ anionexchange column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated in loading buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM 2mercaptoethanol, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol, pH 8.2) and eluted via a 40 volume (40 ml) linear gradient of 100­500 mM NaCl. The AZ elutes as a sharp peak at $280­310 mM NaCl. The yield is about 0.25­0.5 mg. Aliquots are frozen at ­80 . Activity is stable for at least several months but may be lost on repeated freezing and thawing. The activity of the AZ1 preparation can be tested in the aforementioned degradation assay using in vitrotranslated labeled ODC as a substrate and reticulocyte lysate as a source of proteasomes. Metabolic Labeling of ODC. E. coli strain M15[pREP4] (Stratagene) is transformed with the expression plasmid pQE30 (Qiagen) containing the fulllength mouse ODC ORF downstream of the 6x histidine tag. The cells are grown in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/ liter) and kanamycin (50 mg/liter) overnight at 37 . An 80ml volume of the same prewarmed medium is inoculated with 1 ml of the overnight culture and is grown at 37 with vigorous shaking until an OD600 of 0.4­0.6 is reached (2­3 h). The cells are then collected by centrifugation (1600g) at room temperature for 10 min and washed once with M9 medium, followed by resuspension in 40 ml of M9 medium containing 0.063% methionine assay medium (Fisher Scientific). After 30 min of incubation at 37 , protein expression is induced by the addition of IPTG (1 mM). Induction is carried out for 60 min, and [35S]methionine (2.5 mCi) is added for 5 min, followed by unlabeled methionine (1 mM) for an additional 10 min. The cells are chilled on ice for 5 min and are then harvested by centrifugation at 1600g for 10 min at 4 . Cells are washed once by resuspension in 7.5 ml of cold 1Â extraction/wash buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.3 M NaCl). Lysozyme is added to a final concentration of 0.75 mg/ml, and the suspension is incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells are subsequently disrupted by sonication using 3Â 10s pulses with 30s rests on ice between each burst. (Note: Great care should be taken during sonication steps to prevent dispersal of radioactive aerosols.) The cell extract is cleared by centrifugation at 10,000­12,000g at 4 . The resulting supernatant is transferred to 0.5 ml of Talon metal affinity resin (BD Bioscience) that has been equilibrated with 1Â extraction/wash buffer. Binding is allowed to proceed

for 30 min at 4 with constant rocking. The resin is then batch washed by adding 20 volumes of 1Â extraction/wash buffer followed by centrifugation at 1000g for 3 min. This wash is repeated twice more. The resin is then packed into a small volume column ($5 ml) and washed with 5 volumes of 1Â extraction/wash buffer. The labeled His6mODC is then eluted from the Talon resin with 5.0 ml 1Â extraction/wash buffer supplemented with 150 mM imidazole and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.5 fractions are collected. The two fractions with highest radioactivity are pooled and concentrated to 100 l during a buffer exchange to 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP, and 10% glycerol using a column concentrator (Millipore, 30kDa molecular mass cutoff). The specific radioactivity for 35Slabeled ODC is typically about 5 Â 104 cpm/pmol. The labeled ODC can be stored at À80 for 1 month without loss of activity. The purity of the labeled proteins can be assessed by SDS­PAGE and radiography. Radiolabeled ODC should appear as a single band at 53 kDa. The quality of the labeled ODC can be tested by carrying out a degradation assay using rabbit reticulocyte lysate as a source of proteasomes before going on with the following purified system. Unlabeled ODC can be prepared similarly, omitting the labeling steps. The yield of unlabeled ODC is typically 10 mg/liter culture. Proteolysis Reactions. Incubations are performed in a volume of 20 l at 37 and contain 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, an ATP regenerating system (2 mM DTT, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 1.6 mg/ml creatine kinase), 2 mg/ml BSA, 50 nM rat proteasomes, about 2 l 35S ODC (about 10,000 cpm), and 2 g AZ1 (35Slabeled or cold). Reactions are preincubated for 10 min and initiated by the addition of proteasomes. Proteasome inhibitors, when present, are preincubated with all the other components of the reaction for 30 min at 37 before substrate is added. The incubation time for the degradation reaction is typically 30­40 min. The reaction is terminated by adding 140 l of 20% icecold trichloroacetic acid. After incubation on ice for 10­30 min and microcentrifugation for 30 min at 14,000g, 150 l of the supernatant is removed and subjected to scintillation counting to determine the amount of radiolabel converted from TCAprecipitable 35SODC to acidsoluble peptides. Total counts are obtained using water in place of trichloroacetic acid. The background of released counts obtained without proteasomes is usually about 0.5% of the total counts. The percentage degradation of labeled proteins is determined by percentage degradation ¼ (released cpmbackground cpm)/total cpm. By including unlabeled ODC in the reaction and using labeled ODC as a tracer, the initial velocity of degradation can be derived by v ¼ [(percentage degradation) Â (labeled þ unlabeled substrate)]/incubation period. This method of measuring the peptide

products of 35SODC is sensitive enough to accurately measure either AZ1dependent or (the far less active) AZ1independent degradation of ODC. AZ1stimulated degradation of labeled ODC can also be measured by SDS­PAGE and autoradiography. However, observing the disappearance of labeled substrate is much less sensitive than the production of radiolabeled acidsoluble peptides. Similarly, using this reconstituted system, the degradation of unlabeled ODC can be detected by Western blotting using Histag or Flagtag epitopes appended to the N terminus of ODC. Usually in this reconstituted system, AZ1 will stimulate ODC degradation by at least fivefold. If this stimulation is not observed, then the activity of each component, i.e., AZ1, labeled ODC, and proteasome, should be checked as described earlier, using appropriate controls of specificity.
