Abstract The molecular mechanism by which heparin modulates the processing of procathepsin L in the extracellular environment is proposed. We show that heparin reduces the stability of the pro form of cathepsin L at pH 5 by binding to a putative heparin binding motif (BBXB) in the pro-domain. Mutations to this motif on procathepsin L reduce heparin binding affinity and heparin-induced destabilization; in contrast, heparin only slightly destabilizes the mature cathepsin L domain. Gel analysis further shows that heparin makes procathepsin L a much better substrate for cathepsin L. Thus, heparin enhances the rate of zymogen activation by destabilization upon binding to the BBXB motif. Determining the mechanism by which procathepsin L is activated in the extracellular matrix is important to the understanding of the role that cathepsin L plays in tumour invasion.

Cathepsin L is a papain-like lysosomal [1] and extracellular protease [2] that is thought to have a role in tumour invasion into the extracellular matrix [3,4], making cathepsin L a potential target in the treatment of cancer [3]. Cathepsin L is synthesised as an inactive zymogen of 333 amino acids, preprocathepsin L, the first 17 amino acids of which encodes a signal peptide, which directs the protein to the lysosome [5]. The subsequent 94 amino acids encode for the largely a-helical pro-domain [1,6,7] which keeps the protein in a predominately inactive [7] and stable form at neutral pH. Although the signal peptide should result in procathepsin L being sorted to the lysosomes, mutations in the pro-peptide have been shown to result in abnormal glycosylation that results in extracellular secretion of procathepsin L [8]. The final 219 amino acids encode the mature domain which contains three disulfide bonds and is a mixture of a-helices and b-sheets [9]. The mature form

is active at acidic pH and highly unstable at neutral pH [10­12]. Cathepsin L is an auto-activating enzyme and cleaves off its own pro-domain via an intra-molecular mechanism under acidic conditions [13], such as those found in the lysosome [1]. Given the possible role of cathepsin L in tumour invasion, it is interesting to note that heparin and several other glycosoaminoglycans (GAGs), which are vital components of the extracellular matrix, have been shown to affect the activity and processing of the zymogen of cathepsin L [14,15]. For example, dextran sulphate increases the maturation of procathepsin L at pH 5.5 [1], as does the related proteoglycan chondroitin sulphate [15]. Recently published work by the group of Turk has investigated the effect of various GAGs on the processing of procathepsin B [16]. This work demonstrated that heparin and several other GAGs increase the rate of procathepsin B maturation by disrupting the interactions between the propeptide and mature enzyme. However, the molecular mechanism underlying procathepsin L maturation by heparin and GAGs is currently not known.

While analysing the sequence of procathepsin L we noticed a clustering of lysine and arginine residues towards the end of the pro-domain that bear a repetition of the same heparin binding motif (BBXB) as the chemokine RANTES [17], where B represents a basic residue and X represents a hydropathic residues (Fig. 1). The BBXB motif has been shown to play a major role in the binding of GAGs to RANTES and similar motifs are found throughout nature where they mediate a variety of protein GAG interactions [18]. We postulated that the same may be true for the BBXB repeat in the pro-domain of cathepsin L (R98 K99 P100 R101 K102 G103 K104). No similar motif is found in the mature domain. The pro domain of cathepsin B [19] contains no similar BBXB motif and is also markedly shorter (62 amino acids) than that of cathepsin L (96 amino acids). We have mutated two of the lysines in this motif (K99 and K104) to alanine in an attempt to disrupt heparin binding to this motif.

Materials and methods
Materials. Chemicals were purchased either from Sigma-Aldrich or Melford Laboratories (UK). Molecular biology reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs UK or Stratagene (Netherlands). Molecular biology. The gene for preprocathepsin L, amino acids 1­333, (UniProtKB/TrEMBL entry P07711) was obtained from LGC Promochem (ATCC number 6712564) and inserted into the pPICZ-a-B plasmid (Invitrogen) as described previously by our group [20]. Mutations were made using the Quikchangeä method (Stratagene). All construct sequences were confirmed by the University of Dundee Sequencing Service (UK). Protein expression and purification. Procathepsin L mutants was expressed and purified from Pichia pastoris strain X-33 supernatant as described previously [20]. Mature Cathepsin-L was then obtained via published procedures [1]. Heparin sepharose chromatography. A 5 mL heparin sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) was equilibrated in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5 and around 10 mg of protein was loaded. The column was eluted over a linear gradient from 0 M to 1 M NaCl with a flowrate of 5 mL/min.

Equilibrium thermal denaturation. Procathepsin L mutants were exchanged into either 10 mM Tris­acetate pH 8 or 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5, monitoring the change in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity (kex 295 nm, kem 300­400 nm, Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer). Briefly, protein samples (0.1 mg/mL) were placed in a 3 mL fluorescence cuvette and continuously stirred while the temperature was raised up to 75 °C using a peltier device at 1 °C/min within the transition region. The melting temperature (Tm) was calculated as the temperature at which 50% of the protein sample was unfolded. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements. Measurements were made at the circular dichroism facility at Glasgow university using largely the same conditions as those described for the fluorescence measurements. Far UV CD spectra were recorded between 260 nm and 180 nm at 25 °C using protein concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL in 0.02 cm and 0.1 cm quartz cuvettes. The average spectrum following 8 scans was obtained using the following instrument parameters: bandwidth 1.0 nm; scan rate 50 nm/min; response 0.5 s. Near UV CD measurements were obtained between 320 nm and 250 nm at 25 °C using protein concentrations of 2 mg/mL and 0.2 cm pathlength quartz cuvette. The average spectrum following 3 scans was obtained using the following instrument parameters: bandwidth 1.0 nm; scan rate 10 nm/min; response 2.0 s.

suggests that at pH 5 the mature protein contains around 18% a-helix whereas at pH 8 the a-helical contribution decreases to around 4%, with a concomitant increase in unordered structure (Table 2). In contrast, the spectra of the pro form of cathepsin L (procathepsin L C2S) is that of a folded protein at both pH 5 and pH 8, which concurs with previous reports for enzyme activities and processing [1] (Fig. 1). Effect of heparin on the processing and activities of procathepsin L Heparin had a marked effect on the processing of procathepsin L C2S, with the time course of incubation showing that the processing rate was much faster in the presence of heparin than in its absence (Fig. 2). This is consistent with data showing that other polyanions such as dextran sulphate and chondroitin sulphate, also increase the processing of procathepsin-L at pH 5.5 [1,15]. In the presence of heparin, processing from the pro to mature form took around 1 min, although significant amounts of the prodomain remained present even after 4 h. When heparin was absent, processing to the mature form took between 10 min and 30 min, however, after 1 h there was a complete absence of the pro domain and only the mature domain was present. Thus, it seems that the presence of heparin, although initially enhancing the processing rate, leads to slower degradation of the pro-domain fragments. Deletion of the BBXB motif decreases heparin binding affinity Procathepsin L C2S readily bound to the heparin sepharose column at pH 5 (Fig. 3), whereas at pH 8 the protein was found to elute in the void fraction (null data not shown). The double lysine mutant of the pro form (procathepsin L KKAA) was also found to bind to the heparin sepharose column but eluted at a lower salt concentration than procathepsin L C2S, indicating a lower affinity for heparin. Thus, the BBXB motif appears to mediate a binding interaction between heparin and procathepsin L. The mature form of cathepsin L bound strongly to the heparin sepharose column, much like the mature domains of cathepsin B [21] and papain [22]. As previously stated, the mature form of cathepsin L contains no specific heparin binding motif and neither do the mature domains of cathepsin B and papain. Presumably then, the mature cathepsins bind heparin through a general electrostatic mechanism involving various positively charged residues:

Results and discussion Expression of procathepsin L mutants in Pichia pastoris Expression levels between the various mutants described in Table 1 were typically 20­50 mg of purified protein per litre of culture supernatant. The previously cited work on the affect of heparin on cysteine proteases has relied on the loss of specific catalytic activity [16,21,22]. Here we were able to determine structural stability directly because of the large amounts of protein the Pichia pastoris recombinant expression system provides [1,6]. This is in contrast to the Escherichia coli expression systems used for many cysteine proteases [23,24] which yield small amounts of protein that have to be refolded from inclusion bodies. Effect of pH on the conformational stability of pro- and mature cathepsin L The mature form of cathepsin L is reported to exhibit very little activity above pH 7, which has been assumed to be due to structural instability [10­12]. The CD and fluorescence spectra of the mature cathepsin L C2S mutant indicate that this is indeed the case: spectra at pH 5 are characteristic of a folded protein while spectra at pH 8 show the protein to be largely unfolded, indicated by a loss of secondary and tertiary structure in the far and near UV CD spectra and a red-shift in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1).

would seem that the pro-domain masks a region of positively charged residues, or that electrostatic binding is weaker: the calculated pI of procathepsin L being 5.3. Deletion of the BBXB motif decreases heparin destabilization The thermal denaturation data and calculated melting temperatures (Tm) are consistent with the CD data showing that the stability of the procathepsin L mutants are much higher at pH 5 than at pH 8 (Fig. 4A, B and Table 3). Heparin had a marked effect on the Tm of procathepsin L C2S at pH 5, reducing it from 63 °C to 54.4 °C, but had little effect at pH 8, reducing the Tm from 41.5 °C to 40 °C (Table 3). This shows that procathepsin L is markedly destabilised by the presence of heparin at pH 5. It can also be seen from the shape of the unfolding curve (Fig. 4A) that the addition of heparin at pH 5 changed the two-state unfolding mechanism to a three state mechanism, which may be due to the pro-domain unfolding before the mature domain. Heparin had only a slight destabilizing effect on the Tm of the mature form of cathepsin L at pH 5 decreasing the Tm slightly from 64.9 °C to 62.6 °C (Fig. 4C, Table 3). This result suggests that the destabilising effects of heparin at pH 5 are predominately mediated through the pro-domain of cathepsin L. Given the dramatic effect heparin has on the Tm of procathepsin L C2S at pH5 it is perhaps surprising that the CD spectra for procathepsin L C2S in the presence of heparin (data not shown) closely followed those for procathepsin L C2S in the absence of heparin (Fig. 1); the calculated secondary structure values showing only modest change (Table 2). Upon the addition of heparin the a-helical content decreased from 20% to 18% and the b-sheet content increased from 28% to 30%. This is contrast to papain where a substantial increase in the a-helical content (28­43%) and a more modest decrease in the b-sheet content (18­14%) was reported for the addition of heparin to the protein [22]. The Tm for procathepsin L KKAA in the presence of heparin was substantially higher (59.0 °C) when compared with the Tm obtained for procathepsin L C2S (54.4 °C) (Fig. 4B and Table 3). Further, unfolding of procathepsin L KKAA at pH 5 in the presence of heparin still occurred via a two-state mechanism, rather than the three-state

the calculated pI of mature cathepsin L being 4.7 and therefore slightly positively charged at pH 5. Since the binding of the mature domain of cathepsin L to heparin sepharose is much stronger than that of procathepsin L it

mechanism observed for procathepsin C2S. Disruption of the BBXB motif therefore decreases heparin-induced instability. However, as seen for mature cathepsin L, heparin continued to have a small destabilizing effect on the stability of procathepsin L KKAA, presumably mediated either through the mature cathepsin L domain or through residual binding of heparin to the pro-domain. The latter is perhaps not surprising given the lengthy BBXB repeat sequence (R98-K104) and studies performed on the pro domain of cathepsin B [16] which showed that several non sequential charged residues in this region are responsible for interaction with heparin. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the BBXB repeat in the pro-domain of procathepsin L plays a similar role in heparin recognition as determined for the BBXB motif in RANTES. Subsequent heparin binding destabilizes the pro-domain and markedly enhances zymogen activation.
