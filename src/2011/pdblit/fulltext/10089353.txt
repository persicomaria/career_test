Structures of the catalytic site mutants D99A and H48Q and the calcium-loop mutant D49E of phospholipase A2
Crystal structures of the active-site mutants D99A and H48Q and the calcium-loop mutant D49E of bovine phospholipase Ê A2 have been determined at around 1.9 A resolution. The D99A mutant is isomorphous to the orthorhombic recombinant enzyme, space group P212121. The H48Q and the calciumloop mutant D49E are isomorphous to the trigonal recombinant enzyme, space group P3121. The two active-site mutants show no major structural perturbations. The structural water is absent in D99A and, therefore, the hydrogen-bonding scheme is changed. In H48Q, the catalytic water is present and hydrogen bonded to Gln48 N, but the second water found in native His48 is absent. In the calcium-loop mutant D49E, the two water molecules forming the pentagonal bipyramid around calcium are absent and only one O atom of the Glu49 carboxylate group is coordinated to calcium, resulting in only four ligands.

1. Introduction
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) releases arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids on cleavage of the SN2 ester bond of l-phosphoglycerides. These products are important in transmembrane signalling and causing in¯ammation. The active site of PLA2 contains the catalytic dyad, Asp99 and His48, and a catalytic water W6 which acts as a nucleophile during the

enzymatic reaction (Fig. 1a) (Dijkstra et al., 1981; Scott et al., 1990), similar to the catalytic triad (Asp, His, Ser) in serine proteases (Fujinaga & James, 1987; Teplyakov et al., 1990). The catalytic water is hydrogen bonded to His48 N1 on one side and N42 is hydrogen bonded to Asp99 on the other. Both the carboxylate O atoms of Asp99 are involved in a two-way hydrogen bonding with His48 and the surrounding residues (Fig. 1a). It has been shown that Asp is involved in stabilizing the appropriate tautomer of histidine in phospholipases (Li & Tsai, 1993) and in serine proteases (e.g. Sprang et al., 1987). The calcium cofactor is essential for both phospholipid binding and catalysis. It is also in the active-site cleft and is involved in a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination with both carboxylate O atoms of Asp49, the carbonyl O atoms of Tyr28, Gly30 and Gly32 and two water molecules (Fig. 3b). During catalysis, the two anionic O atoms of the phosphate of the substrate replace the two water molecules coordinated to calcium (Scott et al., 1990; Sekar, Eswaramoorthy et al., 1997). The only ligand that is conserved in all PLA2s is the bidentate Asp49 (Davidson & Dennis, 1990). The mutants D49A, D49N, D49Q and D49K have no calcium af®nity, but the mutant D49E has an af®nity weakened by a factor of 12 (Li et al., 1994). The activity of D49E is reduced by a factor of 106 relative to that of wild-type PLA2. It was of interest to study the crystal structures of the activesite mutants (D99A and H48Q) and the calcium-loop mutant D49E to gain a better understanding of the nature of the structural perturbations caused by these mutants and to study the effect of the extra methylene group of Glu49 on the calcium coordination.

2. Materials and methods
The mutants were supplied by Professor M. D. Tsai of the Chemistry Department, Ohio State University. Crystals of the activesite mutant D99A were obtained using the hanging-drop vapordiffusion method at room temperature (291 K). The droplet contained 5 ml of the protein (15 mg mlÀ1) in 50 mM Tris buffer, 5.0 mM CaCl2 and 2.0 ml of 50% MPD equilibrated against 75% MPD in the reservoir. The mutants H48Q (Li & Tsai, 1993) and D49E (Li et al., 1994) were crystallized under similar conditions. The intensity data for all three mutants were collected using an R-AXIS IIc imaging-plate system powered by a Rigaku generator at 50 kV and 100 mA. Crystal data and pertinent parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The atomic coordinates of the recently re®ned orthorhombic recombinant PLA2 (PDB code 1UNE; Sekar & Sundaralingam, 1999) were used as the starting model for the re®nement of D99A. 813 re¯ections were used to calcuÈ late the Rfree value (Brunger,

1992a) to monitor the progress of the re®nement. Initially, 25 cycles of rigid-body re®nement were carried out, followed by 100 cycles of positional re®nement by Powell energy minimization. Without the mutated residue Ala99, the R value dropped to 31.5% (Rfree = 35.8%) for 7297 re¯ections in the Ê resolution range 10.0±1.9 A. Ala99 was then inserted and ®tted into the difference electron-density map, and the model was subjected to simulated annealing by heating the system to 4000 K and slowly cooling to 300 K in steps of 25 K. 100 cycles of positional re®nement lowered the R factor to 27.6% (Rfree = 32.8%). The calcium ion was included and water molecules were added from the difference electron-density maps at various stages of the re®nement. In all, 98 water molecules were included in the re®nement and the ®nal R value was 20.0% (Rfree = 31.3%). The re®ned model consists of 954 non-H protein atoms, one calcium ion and 98 water molecules. The average error for the Ê atomic coordinates is 0.24 A (Luzzati, 1952). The Ramachandran (9,2) plot (Ramakrishnan & Ramachandran, 1965) calculated using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) showed that the main-chain dihedral angles are in the allowed regions, with the exception of residue Val65. The electron density for Tyr52 is not clear and the surface-loop residues 60±70 are disordered. The overall tertiary fold is similar to the recombinant enzyme with an r.m.s. Ê deviation of 0.47 A.
2.2. Re®nement of H48Q

The H48Q re®nement was carried out starting from the atomic coordinates of the recombinant PLA2 (PDB code 1MKT; Sekar et al., 1998). A randomly selected 5% of the re¯ections (347) were È used to calculate Rfree (Brunger, 1992a). Re®nement protocols as above gave a ®nal R value of 20.9% (Rfree = 31.4%), including 68 water molecules with 956 non-H atoms of the protein and one calcium ion. The estimated error in the Ê atomic coordinates is 0.2 A. All the nonglycine and non-proline residues are in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot except residues Val63, Asn67 and Asn79, which are not clear in the electron-density maps. The electron density for the mutated residue is clear but the N-terminal Ala1 is not unlike that in the recombinant trigonal form (Sekar et al., 1998). The overall tertiary fold of the H48Q mutant is very similar to trigonal recombinant PLA2 (r.m.s. Ê deviation = 0.55 A).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Orthorhombic form of D99A mutant

The same stereoview of the calcium coordination in (a) the mutant D49E and (b) in the trigonal recombinant PLA2 (Sekar et al., 1998). The calcium ion is shown as a solid circle. The equatorial calcium water W5 and the axial calcium water W12 are missing in the mutant and are shown as open circles. In the mutant, only one of the carboxylate O atoms is liganded to calcium, compared with the recombinant enzyme where Asp49 forms a bidentate ligation. Thus, calcium has only four ligands in the mutant while it has seven ligands in the recombinant enzyme.

Figure 3

In the orthorhombic D99A mutant the calcium coordination is unaffected compared with the recombinant enzyme, and the ®ve protein ligands to calcium superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of Ê 0.17 A. The calcium±ligand distances Ê vary between 2.10 and 2.53 A with an Ê average of 2.33 A. Pro68 and Tyr52 are not very clear in the electron-density map. The active-site residues Ala1, His48, Ala99 and Tyr73 are slightly perturbed and the structural water is missing.1 This causes a change in the hydrogen-bonding network; the backbone carbonyl groups of Pro68 and Ala1 and the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr52 are hydrogen bonded to the water molecule WH (Fig. 1b) which is directly linked to the structural water found in the recombinant enzyme (Sekar & Sundaralingam, 1999). It should be mentioned that in the orthorhombic recombinant PLA2, the conserved structural water W11 (Fig. 1a) is linked to two additional water molecules (WH and WHH ) (Fig. 1a). In summary, Asp99 is crucial to retain the structural water W11 and form the catalytic triad.
3.2. Trigonal form of H48Q mutant

È re¯ections (688) were used to calculate Rfree (Brunger, 1992a) to monitor the re®nement. The re®nement converged to an R value of 19.8% (Rfree = 27.7%) for 958 protein atoms, 70 water molecules and a calcium ion. The estimated error in the atomic Ê positions is 0.2 A (Luzzati, 1952). All the main-chain torsion angles are in the allowed regions of conformational space. Even though the calcium coordination is affected, the fold of the mutant D49E is similar to the recombinant enzyme (Sekar Ê et al., 1998), with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.42 A for all non-H atoms. È In all cases, the program X-PLOR 3.1 (Brunger, 1992b) was used for the re®nement and the program FRODO (Jones,

The crystal structure of the trigonal H48Q mutant shows that Gln48 can hydrogen bond on both sides of the carboxamide. The oxygen (O41) of Gln hydrogen bonds to the catalytic water, while the N atom (N42) hydrogen bonds according to the scheme observed in His48 of the recombinant enzyme (Fig. 2a). Unlike His, Gln does not appear to accept the proton from the catalytic water, which is not deprotonated, therefore. This leads to the dramatic loss of biological activity of the Gln mutant (Li & Tsai, 1993). In addition, the second water W7 found to be linked to His48 in the recombinant enzyme is absent (Fig. 2b). This water may play a role in assisting the catalytic water W6 in the tauto1

The structural water is also found to be missing in the single mutant D99N (Kumar et al., 1994) and the triple (D99N/Y52,73F) mutants (Sekar, Yu et al., 1997) where the asparagine amide group pushes the structural water out. Acta Cryst. (1999). D55, 443±447

dinated to the Ca2+ ion. The four atoms of the mutant (Gly30, Gly32, calcium ion and the unidentate ligand of Glu49) are in a plane, while the backbone carbonyl group of Ê Tyr28 is displaced by 2.5 A (Fig. 3a). This work indicates how Asp49 in the calcium coordination is essential for the mechanism of substrate hydrolysis and cannot be replaced by Glu49.

In the recombinant PLA2, the calcium ion is seven-coordinated and forms a pentagonal bipyramid (Fig. 3b). One of the waters W5 is in the equatorial plane with the ligands Gly30, Gly32 and Asp49 (both carboxylate O atoms), while the other water W12 is in the axial position opposite Tyr28 (Fig. 3b). The two disul®de bonds, Cys27±Cys123 and Cys29± Cys45 apparently confer additional stability to the calcium loop. During catalysis, the two water molecules involved in the calcium coordination are substituted by the phosphate O atoms of the substrate/inhibitor (Dijkstra et al., 1981; Scott et al., 1990; Sekar, Eswaramoorthy et al., 1997). Asp49 is invariant and provides both of its carboxylate O atoms to the calcium. It is the only side-chain residue available for mutation, but mutating D49 to D49A, D49N, D49Q or D49K gave no enzymatic activity (Li et al., 1994). The crystal structure shows that the mutated Gln49 residue provides only one ligand (O41) (Fig. 4) to the calcium, compared with Asp49 in the recombinant enzyme which provides a bidentate ligand (O1 and O2). Thus, in the mutant, calcium is more labile which is re¯ected in the increased Ê Ê thermal vibration of 47.6 A2 compared with 20.1 A2 in the recombinant enzyme. All the four ligands to calcium also have higher temperature factors than in the recombinant enzyme. The two water molecules liganded to calcium are missing (Fig. 3a). It is possible that they might exhibit large thermal vibrations or disorder. The unidentate ligand of the mutated Ê residue Glu49 is displaced by 0.52 A from Asp49, while the Ê other carboxylate O atom is too distant, 4.36 A, to be coor-
