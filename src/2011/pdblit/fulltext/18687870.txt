Abstract Nodulation formation efficiency D (NfeD) is a member of a class of membrane-anchored ClpP-class proteases. There is a second class of NfeD homologs that lack the ClpP domain. The genes of both NfeD classes usually are part of an operon that also contains a gene for a prokaryotic homolog of stomatin. (Stomatin is a major integral-membrane protein of mammalian erythrocytes.) Such NfeD/stomatin homolog gene pairs are present in more than 290 bacterial and archaeal genomes, and their protein products may be part of the machinery used for quality control of membrane proteins. Herein, we report the structure of the isolated C-terminal domain of PH0471, a Pyrococcus horikoshii NfeD homolog, which lacks the ClpP domain. This C-terminal domain (termed NfeDC) contains a five-strand b-barrel, which is structurally very similar to the OB-fold (oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide­binding fold) domain. However, there is little sequence similarity between it and previously characterized OB-fold domains. The NfeDC domain lacks the conserved surface residues that are necessary for the binding of an OB-fold domain to DNA/RNA, an ion. Instead, its surface is composed of residues that are uniquely conserved in NfeD homologs and that form the structurally conserved surface turns and b-bulges. There is also a conserved tryptophan present on the surface. We propose that, in general, NfeDC domains may interact with other spatially proximal membrane proteins and thereby regulate their activities.

NfeD (nodulation formation efficiency D) belongs to and is the canonical member of a class of membrane-bound metalloproteases of unknown physiological functions (long-form NfeD homologs). NfeD was originally identified as a genetic factor, associated with the pSymB megaplasmid in the symbiotic bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti, that enhances the rate of nodulation formation on a host plant. Currently, more than 300 NfeD homologs have been identified--all of which are bacterial or archaeal in origin. Conversely, no eukaryotic homologs have been found. The nucleotide sequences of all types of NfeD homologs (see below) are very well conserved. An analysis of the protein domain architecture(s) of NfeD homologs indicates that they can be subdivided into two groups: long and short forms. Long-form NfeD homologs have a putative ClpP-class serine protease domain. (ClpP is the proteolytic component of the ClpXP and ClpAP protease complexes. The ClpXP and ClpAP systems are tetradecameric ATP-dependent proteases with protein-unfolding activities; thus, they may be the prokaryotic counterparts of the eukaryotic proteasome, which is responsible for quality control of protein structure [Wickner et al. 1999].) Downstream from the ClpP-class domain is the so-called NfeD domain (also referred to as the DUF107/COG1585 domain) (Green et al. 2004; Yokoyama and Matsui 2005). Short-form homologs do not contain a ClpP domain, but do contain an NfeD domain. Physiological and structural analyses of NfeD proteins have only been reported recently. We demonstrated that the N-terminal region of the NfeD homolog PH1510 (residues 16­236) from Pyrococcus horikoshii possesses serine protease activity and has a Ser-Lys catalytic dyad (Yokoyama and Matsui 2005). Thus, long-form NfeD homologs comprise a subclass of the large family of ClpP proteases. Nineteen prokaryotic and archaeal genomes have been shown to possess operons containing a homologous NfeD/ stomatin gene pair, causing NfeD to be previously named STOPP (stomatin operon partner protein) (Green et al. 2004). Now, we extend this observation to include 294 neighboring NfeD-STOPP/stomatin homolog gene pairs in the genomes of 254 different organisms. For P. horikoshii, two sets of sequential NfeD-STOPP homolog/stomatin homolog genes, PH1510/PH1511 and PH0471/PH0470, exist (Fig. 1A). The results of an operon-predicting algorithm suggest that these gene pairs exist within operons (Ermolaeva et al. 2001). The specific physiological substrate of PH1510 is probably the C-terminal hydrophobic region of PH1511 (Yokoyama and Matsui 2005). Unlike PH1510, PH0471 lacks the ClpP domain and is a ``C-terminal only'' short-form NfeD homolog. Its molecular function is not known. The sequence of PH0471 can be divided into two parts: a membrane-spanning region and a conserved Cterminal 70 residue region (Fig. 1B). 1916

Stomatin (band 7.2 protein) is a major integral membrane protein of human erythrocytes and has an N-terminal SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/ C) domain (Tavernarakis et al. 1999; Morrow and Parton 2005). Stomatin homologs are evolutionarily conserved, not only in eukaryotes but also in bacteria and archaea (Tavernarakis et al. 1999). The bacterial stomatin homologs, HflK and HflC, are well characterized. They form a large integral membrane protease complex with FtsH, a protease involved in protein quality control, and regulate FtsH activity (Kihara et al. 1996). Analogously, other NfeD-STOPP/stomatin gene pairs might be involved in protein quality-control processes. For example, a biological activity for the short-form NfeD homolog, YbbJ of Escherichia coli, was recently reported (Chiba et al. 2006). The corresponding gene, ybbJ, is part of an operon that includes the gene qmcA, which encodes the stomatin homolog QmcA. Overexpression of only QmcA partially reverses the growth retardation of E. coli that occurs at 42°C and that is induced by the dual disruption of the genes ftsH and htpX, which code for two nonessential membrane proteases. When both ybbK and qmcA are overproduced, growth retardation is further suppressed. Herein, we present NMR spectral analyses of the fulllength (residues 1­143, PH0471FL) and a truncated form (residues 72­143, PH0471NfeDC) of PH0471. Included in these analyses is the solution structure of the truncated protein. We also show that this structure is almost certainly repeated in PH0471FL. The PH0471NfeDC structure is a compact five b-strand barrel, with a topology that is strikingly similar to the canonical OB-fold; however, as we will show, the sequences of NfeDC domains have little in common with other functional types of OB-fold domains. Finally, we mapped the evolutionarily conserved residues of NfeD homologs onto the structure of PH0471NfeDC. This map, in conjunction with the conserved surface residue comparisons between PH0471NfeDC and non-NfeDC-type domains, helps illuminate the possible molecular function(s) of and consequential biological implications for NfeDC domain proteins. Results and Discussion Discovery of the C-terminal NfeDC globular domain of PH0471 The PH0471 NfeDC domain was identified by a combinatorial use of bioinformatics (i.e., PSI-BLAST) (Altschul et al. 1997), Pfam20.0 (Bateman et al. 2002, 2004), and SOSUI (Hirokawa et al. 1998; data not shown), and then confirmed by the results of the experiments described below. 15 N-labeled full-length PH0471 (residues 1­143; termed PH0471FL) was expressed in E. coli and purified

in the presence of mild detergents such as OG, DDM. Its 1 H-15N HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy) spectrum is shown in Figure 1C. At most we expected to see 147 HSQC backbone signals (i.e., the 139 peaks associated with the PH0471 sequence and an additional eight peaks arising from the His6 tag and the two-residue linker). However, only 83 well-dispersed peaks are present in the spectrum, and the dispersion pattern is consistent with those found for proteins rich in b-sheets. Indeed, the results of a secondary structure analysis of the CD spectrum of DPC-solubilized PH0471FL are 31% a-helices and 32% b-strands (data not shown), suggesting the presence of a b-sheet-rich domain in PH0471. When detergent-solubilized PH0471FL was digested with trypsin, cleavage occurred preferentially after R73 and K82 (Fig. 1B), which generated two protease-resistant segments with molecular weights of 8011 and 8872 Da as identified in a MALDITOF mass spectrum.

We then constructed a vector that encoded the nucleotide sequence of the C-terminal region of PH0471 (residues 72­143; PH0471NfeDC) and expressed the recombinant protein in E. coli. Unlike PH0471FL, this protein is soluble when extracted from E. coli. Its 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Fig. 1D) has well-dispersed signals with line widths that are narrower than are those of the PH0471FL spectrum (Fig. 1C). The position of each observed signal could be matched to one of the dispersed signals in the spectrum of PH0471FL, as there is nearly a one-to-one correspondence in position. Therefore, most likely, the HSQC spectrum of detergent-solubilized PH0471FL is dominated by signals that originate from the C-terminal residues of PH0471. Based on the experiments presented above, it is apparent that a PH0471 C-terminal globular domain exists, which we term the NfeDC domain. In addition, it seems that the NfeDC domain is structurally and spatially independent of the membrane-spanning helices, and is highly mobile, that is,

the linker peptide (residues 72­86) flexibly connects the membrane-spanning helices to the NfeDC domain. Structural determination of PH0471NfeDC The NMR signals of PH0471NfeDC were assigned using a combination of standard 3D NMR techniques. The assigned backbone 1H-15N HSQC peaks are shown in Figure 1D. The side-chain signals were assigned according to a standard protocol, and 99% of the un-exchangeable protons were assigned. An ensemble of 20 structures of low CYANA target function (Fig. 2A) was generated from 1501 experimental NMR constraints. The 20 structures satisfy the experimental constraints very well (Table 1). The stereochemical quality of the members of the ensemble is good, with all backbone u/c angles occupying the most favored or slightly less favored regions of a Ramachandran plot (Table 1; Supplemental Fig. S1). Excluding the disordered regions, that is, the N-terminal region (residues 72­86) and the C-terminal residues (residues 141­143 plus the extra eight residues of the ° tag), the RMSD values are 0.31 A for backbone heavy ° for all heavy atoms. atoms and 0.84 A Structural characteristics of PH0471NfeDC PH0471NfeDC is organized into a compact five-stranded b-barrel fold, which consists of strand b1 (residues 91­ 96), strand b2 (residues 102­106), strand b3 (residues 109­113), strand b4 (residues 124­130), and strand b5 (residues 135­139) (Fig. 2B). This barrel has a Greek key topology and is known as an OB-fold domain. The topology diagram is shown in Figure 2C with bulged residues and turns indicated (see below). The b3- and b5-strands run parallel to each other, whereas all other strands are oriented in an antiparallel manner. Within these strands, there are five bulged residues, three of which are part of classic bulges (L103-V95-K96, K136V128-D129, D131-L133-K134, using the residue X-1-2 representation); while the other two participate in ``G1'' bulges (V94-G122-D123 and V127-G89-K90). All sequentially adjacent strands, except b3 and b4, are connected by short turns. Turn 1 (between b1 and b2) and turn 4 (between b4 and b5) are typical Type IV b-turns; whereas turn 2 (between b2 and b3) is a fiveresidue turn comprised of two overlapping b-turns: a Type IV turn (residues 105­108) and a Type I9 turn (residues 106­109) (Fig. 2D). There are also two typical Type II turns: one each before strands b1 and b4 (turn 0: residues 87­90; and turn 3: residues 120­123, respectively). After the PH0471NfeDC structure was determined, a multiple sequence alignment of NfeDC domains was generated from the 380 nonredundant (nr) sequences that 1918

are homologous to NfeD, with gap penalties defined by the PH0471NfeDC secondary structure (Supplemental Fig. S3). Figure 3A presents representative sequences so aligned. For these sequences, the percentage of identical amino acids, when compared with the PH0471NfeDC sequence, varies from 13% to 90%. To identify conserved residues, HMMER 2.3.2 and the multiple alignments were used to generate a hidden Markov's model (HMM). The HMM for NfeDC is shown as a sequence logo in Figure 3B.

conserved Type II b-turn containing G132 and L133) (Fig. 3D). It is noteworthy that solvent-accessible tryptophan residues are often found at interfaces of protein­ protein complexes (Jones and Thornton 1995, 1996; Bogan and Thorn 1998; Ma et al. 2003). NfeDC domain is a novel member of an OB-fold superfamily A DALI search (Holm and Sander 1997) was performed using the PH0471NfeDC structure, and consequently 37 proteins containing one or more OB-fold domains were retrieved, all with associated Z-scores >4.0. The OB-fold domains for 16 of those proteins are structurally very similar to PH0471NfeDC with RMSDs no greater than 2.0 ° A. As examples, the following proteins, each with their PDB code, Z-score, and RMSD given sequentially in parentheses, have OB-fold domains: the N-terminal domain of the ribosome-binding GTPase YjeQ (1u0l; 6.3; ° 2.2 A), the E. coli major cold-shock protein CspA (1mjc; ° 6.1; 2.0 A), the ribosomal protein S17 (2f4v-chain Q; 6.0; ° ), the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 TSST-1 (1aw7; 2.1 A ° 5.4; 1.8 A), and the molybdate-binding protein ModG ° (1h9j; 5.3; 2.2 A) (Fig. 4A­E). Many OB-fold domains possess a short a-helix between b3 and b4, illustrated in Figure 4E, but it is absent in PH0471NfeDC. In addition, many of these structurally related proteins (seven of the 16) possess a common nucleic acid-binding interface (for review, see Arcus 2002; Theobald et al. 2003). An attempt to predict the PH0471NfeDC domain structure based only on sequence information would have been futile. For example, when the sequence of residues 74­ 143 was subjected to a PSI-BLAST search against the nr database (E-value cutoff to the next iteration ¼ 0.05), the run converged after nine iterations and retrieved 325 sequences including redundant ones, but contained only NfeD orthologous sequences and no OB-fold proteins. We confirmed this observation by performing a reverseddirection PSI-BLAST search after the structure was solved. The structurally related sequences--YjeQ, CspA, ribosomal protein S17, TSST-1, and molybdate-binding protein--were subjected to a PSI-BLAST search (E-value cutoff ¼ 0.1). The runs converged after 8, 10, 4, 2, and 30 iterations, respectively, with 14 to 3064 retrieved sequences (data not shown). None of the retrieved sequences are NfeD orthologs. These results are reasonable, since generally PSI-BLAST can more readily find a distant family member of the query sequence than it can find members of a different family within a superfamily. We also tried to predict the NfeDC structure using the more recently developed prediction method, the fold recognition method. The sequence of residues 74­143 was submitted to the FORTE server (Tomii and Akiyama 2004), but no significant hits, as defined by the FORTE

For the 67 residue positions, 25 are well conserved in all NfeD proteins, a conclusion based on relative entropy values that are >1.0 as found in the sequence logo analysis. The 10 residues with solvent-exposed surface areas of <5% (buried) and the two residues with solventexposed surface areas of 5%­10% (mostly buried) in the PH0471NfeDC structure are conserved in the NfeD protein sequences. The positions of the side chains that compose the hydrophobic core are diagrammed in Figure 2E. Additionally, certain residues located in the b-bulges and b-turns are also well conserved. For example, all five glycine residues, which are found in the turns or in the bulges, are conserved (Figs. 3B and 2D). Interestingly, the most significantly conserved residue, W111, which is located at the peripheral of the hydrophobic core, is partially solvent exposed (Fig. 2E). The conserved solvent-accessible, i.e., surface, residues were identified at the ConSurf server (Glaser et al. 2003), and their positions were mapped onto the surface of PH4071NfeDC (Fig. 3D). The electrostatic potentials of these residues were also mapped (Fig. 3C). Examination of the conserved-residue surface shows that the most well-conserved region includes W111, which is surrounded by conserved charged residues and conserved residues that form turn 2 (the conserved five-residue turn between b2 and b3 containing G108 and D109), b3, turn 0 (the first Type II b-turn followed by the G1 bulge, containing the conserved L87 and G89), and turn 4 (the

literature (Z-scores >8), were retrieved. More specifically, while three out of the top five hits (4.5 > Z-score > 3.8) were OB-fold proteins, their Z-scores (4.5 > Z-score > 3.8) were not trustworthy. Comparison of the NfeDC domain with OB-fold domains We compared the conserved surface residues of nonNfeDC-type OB-fold domains with the corresponding residues of PH0471NfeDC. For the OB-fold domain proteins with nucleic acid-binding properties, their conserved surface aromatic residues, most of which are found in strands b2, b3, turn 2, and turn 4, form a continuous surface and participate in binding (Arcus 2002; Theobald et al. 2003). For example, the seven aromatic residues (W11, F18, F20, F31, H33, F34, and Y42) present in CspA are known to be responsible for its RNA-binding. However, PH0471NfeDC does not contain such aromatic residues. Although five of its aromatic residues (Y83, F85, H101, W111, and Y114) are solventexposed, these residues, excepting W111, are not well conserved among NfeD homologs. Thus, the NfeDC domain of PH0471 probably does not bind nucleic acids. Next, the conserved OB-fold surface residues necessary for molybdate binding (Delarbre et al. 2001) were identified. For example, these are S4, R6, A20, V21, N22, T40, S43, K60, and A61 of the first ModG OB-fold

domain. However, we found no similarities between any of the molybdate-binding residues and the corresponding residues of PH0471NfeDC (data not shown). Similarly, we considered whether PH0471NfeDC might be related to the periplasmic copper ion-binding bacterial CusF protein (Loftin et al. 2005) and thus be able to transport metals (Fig. 4F). A comparison of the two domain sequences identified some sequential and struc° tural similarities (22% sequence identity, 2.2 A RMSD). NfeDC Indeed, when probed with PH0471 , DALI retrieved CusF as the eighteenth hit (1zeq; Z-score ¼ 4.8; RMSD ¼ ° 2.2 A) (Fig. 4F). However, the conserved histidine, H36, and the two conserved methionines, M47 and M49 of CusF that are responsible for Cu(I) ion binding, are not present in the NfeDC domain. The corresponding PH0471NfeDC residues are V106, D109, and W111. Apparently, the NfeDC domain is not a nucleic acid-, a small ionic ligand-binding domain. Since we also found no obvious pocket or cleft on the domain surface, it is unlikely that the NfeDC domain binds nonionic small ligand(s). Therefore, having excluded many other possibilities and given the extended conserved surface area surrounding the conserved W111, we hypothesized that the NfeDC domain may bind a second protein via the conserved surface. Based on this hypothesis, we compared the surface characteristics of the NfeDC domain with that of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), a protein that binds the MHC-class II molecules of human T-cells via its OB-fold domain (Earhart et al. 1998). TSST-1 is a member of pyrogenic toxin superantigens, which binds to the MHC-class II molecule of the human T-cell using its OB-fold domain. The TSST-1 surface residues involved in binding include L30, I42, L44, I46, S53, and F83, most of which are part of b3 (Fig. 4D). The corresponding residues of PH0471NfeDC are E99, K110, I112, Y114, D116, and L133, respectively. Additionally, while P50 and I81 of TSST-1 are also involved in binding, the sequence alignment indicates that the corresponding positions have been deleted from PH0471. As the binding residues of TSST-1 are not conserved in the PH0471 sequence, it is unlikely that the latter binds class-II MHC molecules. Putative molecular function(s) of short-form NfeD homologs There are few reports describing the function(s) of NfeD proteins. We found that the isolated ClpP domain of PH1510 is an active protease, although its sequence is not similar to those of most other ClpP domains (<15% sequence identity) (Yokoyama and Matsui 2005). We also found that PH1511, a P. horikoshii stomatin homolog whose gene is adjacent to that of PH1510 (Fig. 1A), is a substrate of PH1510.

Besides our work on NfeD homolog/stomatin homolog interactions, there are other reports about the biological functions of NfeD/stomatin type gene pairs. Disruption of yqeZ, which encodes a long-form NfeD homolog, results in a partial susceptibility to the antimicrobial peptide sublancin produced by other Bacilli (Butcher and Helmann 2006). yqeZ is part of a Bacillus operon that also includes yqfA and yqfB. yqfA is a stomatin homolog, whereas, the function of the yqfB protein product is unknown (Shen et al. 2005). To fully resist the actions of sublancin, Bacillus overproduces all three proteins. The results of all existing studies concerning microbial NfeD homologs/stomatin homologs, when taken together, suggest that the presence of operons containing the paired genes is important physiologically. That a prokaryotic NfeD homolog may act in concert with its partner stomatin homolog was first proposed by Green et al. (2004), who emphasized the importance of this pairing by referring to NfeD as ``STOPP'' (stomatin operon partner protein). As we have shown, not only are the genes for PH0471 (NfeD-STOPP) and PH0470 (stomatin) found next to each other, but so are more than 290 other gene pairs encoding short-form NfeD-STOPP homologs and stomatin homologs. Such paired genetic linkage of conserved genes suggests that a physical interaction between them exists. Having eliminated the possibilities that the NfeDC domain of PH0471 binds nucleic acids or metal ions and having found no obvious small molecule-binding cavity, the most likely remaining hypothesis is that it binds PH0470 via a surface composed of characteristic bulges and charged residues. Indeed, we observed a weak interaction between PH0470 (residues 192­298) and the NfeDC domain of PH1510 (residues 371­441) (Yokoyama et al. 2006). Using NMR spectroscopy as the probe, we also titrated a PH0470 fragment (residues 66­182), corresponding to its SPFH domain, against 15 N-labeled PH0471NfeDC (data not shown). However, no remarkable interactions were detected. Possibly, PH0471NfeDC interacts with PH0470 with its juxtamembrane region and/or C-terminal coiled-coil region (residues 192­ 298), the latter of which is predicted as an a-helical region. However, ours is only a suggestion--the reason(s) why NfeD-STOPP homologs and stomatin homologs are conserved as gene pairs is not yet understood. Studies using protein constructs that can insert themselves into membranes are required because NfeD-STOPP and stomatin homologs are integral-membrane proteins. In conclusion, the C-terminal domain of NfeD proteins is a novel OB-fold domain. Mapping the evolutionarily conserved residues of NfeDC domains onto the domain structure in conjunction with the elimination of many other possible functions allowed us to propose a possible function for this type of OB-fold domain. The structural information obtained from our study will be useful when 1922

designing mutants whose actions might help clarify the function(s) of the NfeD OB-fold domains and why NfeD homolog/stomatin homolog operons exist in the genomes of so many archaea and bacteria. Materials and Methods Protein techniques
The vectors containing the nucleotide sequences for full-length PH0471 (residues 1­143; PH0471FL) and a C-terminal fragment (residues 72­143; PH0471NfeDC) of PH0471 were constructed using standard PCR-cloning methods and inserted into pET21b vectors (Novagen). Each construct contained a C-terminal His6 tag and a two-residue linker. The corresponding proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)RIL (Novagen), respectively. For NMR spectroscopy, [15N]labeled and 13C/15N-labeled proteins were isolated from 2-L cultures that had been incubated at 37°C and that contained either [15N]-NH4Cl and unlabeled glucose, or [15N]-NH4Cl and [13C]-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. After expression, PH0471FL was solubilized in 1.5% DDM, passed through DEAE-Sepharose resin (GE-Healthcare Biosciences), affinity-purified over Ni2+-charged chelating-Sepharose resin (GE-Healthcare Biosciences), and dialyzed against the NMR sample buffer (see below). PH0471NfeDC was found in the soluble fraction of the sonicated, cleared extract of its BL21CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL culture. It was then purified sequentially by anion exchange chromatography over DEAE-Sepharose resin (GE-Healthcare Biosciences) and by affinity chromatography over Ni2+-charged chelating-Sepharose resin. DDM-solubilized PH0471FL was partially digested with trypsin by incubating 20 mg of protein with various amounts of trypsin (a 1:100, 1:250, 1:500, or 1:1000 ratio of trypsin to PH0471) for 180 min at 25°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 1% SDS containing PMSF and heating the solutions for 5 min to 95°C. The proteolytic fragments were characterized using 15% SDS-PAGE and MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. The CD spectrum of PH0471FL in 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% DDM was recorded at 25°C using a JASCO JCD700 CD-spectrometer. A 10 mM protein sample and a cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length were used. The secondary structure content was calculated using a program supplied by JASCO.

NMR spectroscopy
Samples for NMR spectroscopy contained either 15N- or 13C/ 15 N-labeled PH0471NfeDC at concentrations of 0.7­1.0 mM in 5% D2O­95% H2O, 25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 5.0), 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA. Backbone and side-chain assignments were obtained from 15N-HSQC, 13C-HSQC, HNCA, HNCO, HNCACB, CBCACONH, HCC(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY spectra recorded at 25°C using 500 MHz and 800 MHz Bruker AVANCE NMR spectrometers, each equipped with a cryomagnetic probe and a 900 MHz VARIAN INOVA NMR spectrometer (Yamazaki et al. 1994; Cavanagh et al. 1996). Data were processed using NMRPipe (Delaglio et al. 1995) and SPARKY (T.D. Goddard and D.G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco) software. Interproton distances were obtained from 3D 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY s+ectra recorded with 150-msec and 120-msec mixing times,

respectively. Hydrogen bonds were experimentally identified using data obtained from a H/D-exchange experiment and confirmed by the presence of NOE signals between the corresponding residues. While a total of 16 hydrogen bonds were identified, only the 11 hydrogen bonds involved in the secondary structure were used as hydrogen-bond restraints for structure calculations. Chemical shift assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number 10118). The backbone signals of DDM-solubilized PH0471FL were assigned by comparing the cross-peaks of its HSQC spectrum, recorded at 25°C using a 500 MHz Bruker AVANCE NMR spectrometer, to those of the corresponding spectrum of PH0471NfeDC. For this experiment, a solution of ;750 mL containing 0.04 mM PH0471FL and ;0.1% DDM was concentrated by ultrafiltration until the volume was 300 mL (Microsep, MWCO 10,000; Pall Co. Ltd.). DDM micelles are retained by this filter; thus, the final protein and detergent concentrations of the NMR sample were ;0.1 mM and 0.25%, respectively. The stability of the NfeDC domain within PH0471FL is unaffected by this treatment as judged by the quality of its HSQC spectrum.

For stomatin homologs, using the HMM data for the SPFH domain located at the Pfam (ver 20.0) server (Bateman et al. 2004) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/), protein sequences containing the SPFH domain were identified. Using that HMM, 2950 sequences were retrieved from the nr database. Neighboring gene pairs of NfeD homologs and stomatin homologs were identified by comparing the two corresponding sequence lists.

Protein Data Bank and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank accession numbers The atomic coordinates of the 20 best PH0471NfeDC NMR structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 2EXD (http://www.wwpdb. org/). Chemical shift data are available from the BioMag ResBank under accession number 10118 (http://www. bmrb.wisc.edu/). Acknowledgments

Structure determination and analysis
Structures were calculated using the standard seven-iterative cycle protocol of the program CYANA version 2.0.17 (Herrmann et al. 2002; Guntert 2003). All NOE cross-peaks were picked manually using SPARKY. In total, 1501 meaningful NOE upperdistance restraints were obtained including 543 long-range distances. Additionally, the 22 hydrogen-bond restraints were included in the calculations. The 20 structures (out of 200 total) with the smallest number of violations were analyzed (Table 1). ° No distance restraint was violated by more than 0.15 A, and no torsion angle restraint by more than 10.3°. The coordinates were examined using the program Promotif3 (Hutchinson and Thornton 1996), which found and classified the turns and bulges of PH0471NfeDC. Characterization of the conserved surface residues was done at the ConSurf server (Glaser et al. 2003). All figures were prepared using MOLMOL (Koradi et al. 1996).

Bioinformatics analysis
Protein sequence similarity searches were performed using the programs BLAST (bl2seq) and PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) against the nonredundant (nr) database curated at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (ftp:// ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/). First, using BLAST and an Evalue smaller than 2.0, sequences homologous to PH0471NfeDC were identified. For these 293 sequences, a prototype multiple sequence alignment was generated using ClustalX (Thompson et al. 1997) with a secondary structure penalty score derived from a representative NMR solution structure. Using this prototype alignment, a hidden Malkov's model (HMM) was generated using the program HMMER 2.3.2 package (http:// hmmer.wustl.edu). This HMM was then used to identify sequences with less homology present in the nr database. Finally, using HMMER, 380 sequences were identified when using an E-value <3.0. Using these 380 sequences, a new hidden Malkov's model was generated whose sequence was submitted to the LogoMat-M server (Schuster-Bockler and Bateman 2005) (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/software/analysis/logomat-m.cgi) to produce the sequence logo.
