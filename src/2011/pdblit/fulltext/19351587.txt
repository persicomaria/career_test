The Role in Flagellar Rod Assembly of the N-terminal Domain of Salmonella FlgJ, a Flagellumspecific Muramidase
Takanori Hirano, Tohru Minamino and Robert M. Macnab*
Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry Yale University, New Haven CT 06520-8114, USA The C-terminal half of the Salmonella ¯agellar protein FlgJ has peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activity and it has been suggested that it is a ¯agellumspeci®c muramidase which locally digests the peptidoglycan layer to permit assembly of the rod structure to proceed through the periplasmic space. It was also suggested that FlgJ might be involved in rod formation itself, although there was no direct evidence for this. We puri®ed basal body structures from SJW1437(¯gJ) transformed with plasmids encoding various mutant FlgJ proteins and found that these basal bodies possessed the periplasmic P ring but lacked the outer membrane L ring; they also lacked a hook at their distal end. All of these mutant FlgJ proteins had an altered or missing C-terminal domain but had at least the ®rst 151 amino acid residues of the N-terminal domain. Immunoblotting analysis of fractionated cell extracts revealed that a rod/hook export class protein, FlgD, was exported to the periplasm but not to the culture supernatant in these mutants. FlgJ was shown to physically interact with several proteins, and especially FliE and FlgB, which are believed to reside at the cell-proximal end of the rod. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the N-terminal 151 amino acid residues of FlgJ are directly involved in rod formation and that the muramidase activity of FlgJ, though needed for formation of the L ring and subsequent events such as hook formation, is not essential for rod or P ring formation. In contrast, muramidase activity alone does not support rod assembly.

Introduction
The ¯agellum is the locomotive organelle which drives bacteria through their environments. To ®nd optimal conditions, they often change the direction of rotation of the ¯agellum by sensing the difference of attractant and repellent concentrations. The ¯agellum is divided into at least ®ve substructures called the basal body, the hook, the hook-®lament junction zone, the ®lament and the ®lament cap.

The most complex part is the basal body, which is composed of the cytoplasmic C ring (consisting of FliG, FliM and FliN subunits, although FliG is sometimes regarded as forming a distinct substructure1), the inner or MS ring (FliF), the periplasmic P ring (FlgI), the outer membrane L ring (FlgH, a lipoprotein2) and the rod (FlgB, FlgC, FlgF and FlgG). Another protein, FliE, is also a component of the basal-body structure, and probably acts as an interface between the MS ring and the rod.3 The basal body is imbedded in the cell surface and, together with the Mot proteins, plays a role in rotary motor function. The hook and ®lament, which are tubular structures composed of subunits of hook protein (FlgE) and ¯agellin (FliC), respectively, extend outwards from the cell. The hook-®lament junction zone (FlgK and FlgL) and the ®lament cap (FliD) are located between the hook and ®lament and at the tip of the ®lament, respectively. Their component proteins have some

360 common structural features (for example, they contain heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues near their N and/or C termini).4 The rod, hook, junction, ®lament and capping proteins are collectively called the axial protein family. For a review, see ref. 5. Flagellar assembly begins with the basal body, proceeds with the hook, and ®nishes with the ®lament. Capping proteins are needed to permit the polymerization of some components of the ¯agellar structure. Salmonella ¯agella have at least two kinds of capping protein, which are used at different stages of ¯agellar assembly. One is the hook capping protein, FlgD, and the other is the ®lament capping protein, FliD. FlgD and FliD exist at the tip of the growing hook and ®lament structures, respectively.6,7 Although both FlgE and FliC can self-assemble without these capping proteins in vitro, they cannot do so in the living cell and are secreted to the external medium. Recently, Yonekura et al.8 analyzed by electron microscopy the structures of the FliD-®lament complex at the assembly point and showed that disordered N and C termini of the capping protein, FliD, play an important role in creating an open assembly site for newly delivered subunits of FliC. It is not known whether an equivalent capping protein exists for formation of the rod, which occurs in a ®nite compartment, the periplasm. FlgJ is required for rod formation, because mutants with serious defects in this protein produce only the MS ring.9 Within its C-terminal region, FlgJ has homology to the catalytic domains of various muramidases,10 suggesting that it may be responsible for the penetration of the peptidoglycan layer by the rod. The diameter of the ¯agellar rod of Salmonella has been variously estimated at about 11 nm11 or 7.5 nm.12 In either case, the diameter is too large to allow the nascent rod to penetrate the peptidoglycan layer (estimated effective mesh diameter of ca. 4 nm13) without muramidase activity. Nambu et al.14 have shown that FlgJ is exported into the periplasm via a specialized export system called the type III ¯agellar export pathway and that it has a peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activity which is important for ¯agellar formation; mutations in catalytically important residues result in extremely poor ¯agellation and swarming ability. Muramidase activity is not absolutely required, perhaps because the rod has a small chance of penetrating gaps generated during peptidoglycan biogenesis. Although a fragment consisting of the C-terminal half of FlgJ still has the ability to hydrolyze peptidoglycan, it cannot support ¯agellation of the cells at all, indicating that the N-terminal half of FlgJ is essential for the overall process of ¯agellar assembly. Part of the reason is likely to be that information necessary for the export of type III export substrates resides in their N-terminal regions,15 and so the muramidase activity of FlgJ could not take place in the periplasm if its N terminus was truncated. However, there may be other

Salmonella Flagellar Rod Assembly

reasons why the N-terminal region of FlgJ is important. One possibility is that it functions as a rod capping protein. Like members of the axial protein family, FlgJ has a heptad repeat near its C terminus (Figure 1), raising the possibility that FlgJ, although not found as a component of wild-type ¯agellar structure or any ¯agellar precursors, may be associated with the growing rod structure during rod assembly. Until now, it has been believed that ¯gJ mutants produce a structure consisting only of the MS ring.9 However, the mutants that led to this conclusion produced severely truncated FlgJ proteins14 and were essentially nulls. In this study, we show that some ¯gJ mutants that lack muramidase activity, nonetheless produce a a basal body structure that lacks only the L ring. We also show that FlgJ, and especially its N-terminal 151 amino acid residues, is directly involved in rod formation and that it physically binds to the components of the rod structures. On the basis of these results, we propose that FlgJ functions as a scaffolding protein for rod assembly as well as a ¯agellum-speci®c muramidase that permits penetration of the peptidoglycan layer and completion of basal body assembly.

Results
Design of mutant FlgJ proteins Nambu et al. reported that the C-terminal half of FlgJ has peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing activity and that this activity seems to play a role when the rod is assembling in the periplasmic space during ¯agellar morphogenesis.14 However, the role of the N-terminal half of FlgJ was not determined. Because the axial ¯agellar proteins have a heptad repeat at their N and/or C termini,4 we looked for a heptad repeat region in the FlgJ sequence using the MultiCoil program16 and found one near the C terminus (Figure 1(a)). Other muramidases unlinked to ¯agellar function, such as the autolysin from the (non-motile) Enterococcus hirae, which show signi®cant similarity to the FlgJ muramidase domain,10 lack heptad repeats and show no signi®cant sequence similarity to the extreme C-terminal sequence of FlgJ. To investigate the role of the N-terminal and heptad repeat regions of FlgJ in the rod assembly process, we designed three C-terminally truncated FlgJ proteins, FlgJN (consisting of the N-terminal 151 amino acid residues), FlgJÁHR (lacking the last 27 amino acid residues, which contain the heptad repeat), and FlgJ (E223Q/D248N)ÁHR (lacking the heptad repeat and also two residues important for muramidase activity and ¯agellar assembly14) (Figure 1(b)). ¯gJ alleles encoding these proteins were cloned into pET-19b (Table 1). We also used pTN503 (encoding FlgJC, i.e., FlgJ lacking the ®rst 151 amino acid residues) and pTN507 (encoding FlgJ (E223Q/D248N), and so having very low muramidase activity).

361 wild-type levels by Coomassie staining of SDSPAGE gels (data not shown). Next we examined the ability of these mutant FlgJ proteins to complement SJW1437 (¯gJ) (Figure 2). pTH010 (wild-type FlgJ) fully complemented. pTH012 (FlgJ E223Q/D248N), pTH013 (FlgJN), pTH014 (FlgJÁHR) and pTH015 (FlgJÁHR E223Q/D248N), all of which produced FlgJ with an intact N-terminal domain, restored swarming ability to a slight degree. When examined by highintensity dark-®eld light microscopy, cells were found to be either non-motile or swimming poorly. Nambu et al. found that the swarming ability of FlgJ catalytic mutants correlated with the degree of muramidase activity of FlgJ.14 However, this is only true if the N-terminal region is intact: pTN50314 and pTH011 (this study), both of which encode only the C-terminal domain of FlgJ, supply full muramidase activity, yet do not complement swarming (Figure 2) or motility in liquid medium at all. pTH014 encodes FlgJÁHR, which has a com-

Flagellar morphology of muramidase-deficient and C-terminally truncated flgJ mutants ¯gJ mutants that produce severely truncated proteins assemble only the MS ring.9 To investigate if this result was also true for the ¯gJ mutants constructed in this study, we puri®ed immature ¯agellar structures from SJW1437 (¯gJ) carrying the pETbased plasmids pTH001, pTH002, pTH003,

pTN507 and pTN503. We also puri®ed immature and wild-type hook-basal body structures from SJW1437 carrying pET-19b and pMM501, respectively. Basal body samples solubilized by lauryl dimethyl amine oxide (LDAO) were subjected to CsCl density gradient centrifugation and fractionated into 2 ml volumes from the top to the bottom of the centrifuge tube. These puri®ed structures were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining. The results for basal bodies from two of these plasmids, pTH002 and pTN507, are shown in Figure 3(a). With the puri®ed structures from pTH001, pTH002, pTH003 and pTN507, all basal body proteins were detected except for the L ring protein FlgH. The amounts of the hook protein, FlgE, and the ¯agellin protein, FliC, were greatly reduced compared to those of wild-type hook basal body; the small amounts detected can be attributed to the leakiness associated with FlgJ that is defective only in the muramidase domain. In puri®ed structures from pET-19b and pTN503, only the MS-ring protein FliF was detected (data not shown). Next, we performed electron microscopy on these partial structures (Figure 3(b) and (c)). Most of the structures observed were, in the nomenclature of Suzuki et al.,17 candlesticks (i.e. basal bodies lacking only the L ring); some intact ¯agella were also observed, presumably because of leakiness (cf. Figure 2). These results demonstrate that the ®rst 151 residues at the N terminus of FlgJ are necessary for rod formation, but that neither muramidase

Export of FlgD by flgJ mutants Electron microscopy and the appearance of silver-stained gels of puri®ed basal bodies from SJW1437 carrying pTN507, pTH001, pTH002 or pTH003 showed that (with occasional exceptions) they lack the outer or L ring. This ring appears to be essential (or at least very important18) for penetration of the outer membrane by the growing ¯agellar structure, since a FlgH (L ring) mutant can export substrates into the periplasm but not into the culture supernatant.19 To test whether these ¯gJ mutants were defective in penetration of the outer membrane, we examined whether they could export the hook capping protein FlgD to the culture supernatant (in wild-type cells, the hook cap is the ®rst structure to be assembled beyond the outer membrane). The periplasmic and culture supernatant fractions from SJW1437(¯gJ) harboring various ¯gJ mutant plasmids were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FlgD antibody (Figure 4). FlgD was detected in the periplasmic fraction of SJW1437 and all other mutant ¯gJ strains,19 but only in the culture supernatant fraction from SJW1437 complemented by wild-type ¯gJ. Thus it appears that, if the muramidase activity of FlgJ is defective, the growing rod structure cannot reach and penetrate the outer membrane.

364 Affinity blotting of components of rod structure with N-His-FLAG-tagged FlgJ We have shown that FlgJ is directly involved in rod formation. We next examined whether this is because FlgJ physically interacts with components of the rod structure. First, we carried out af®nity blotting with puri®ed N-His-FLAG-FlgJ as probe against the following proteins: (i) the putative MS ring-rod junction protein FliE; (ii) the rod proteins FlgB, FlgC, FlgG and FlgF; (iii) the hook protein FlgE and the hook capping protein FlgD; (iv) FlgJ itself; and (v) ¯agellin FliC. Whole cell proteins were prepared from BL21 (DE3) pLysS carrying pET-19b-based plasmids encoding N-terminally His-tagged versions of these proteins. These samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Figure 5(a)) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with N-His-FLAG-tagged FlgJ and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 5(b)). His-FLAG-tagged FlgJ bound most strongly to FlgB and FlgJ itself. It also bound strongly to FliE, FlgC and FlgD. Binding of FlgJ to FlgF and FlgG were much weaker. Affinity blotting of mutant FlgJ proteins with N-His-FLAG-tagged FlgJ We suspected that the N-terminal ¯agellumspeci®c domain of FlgJ was responsible for the homologous FlgJ-FlgJ interaction. To test whether this was the case, we carried out af®nity blotting using whole cell proteins from HMS174(DE3)pLysS carrying pET-22b-based plasmids encoding various mutant versions of FlgJ as targets, and N-HisFLAG-tagged FlgJ as probe. The membrane was then probed with anti-FLAG antibody (Figure 6). Only FlgJC failed to be recognized by full-length FlgJ (lane 3), whereas all versions carrying an intact N terminus (lanes 2, 4-7), including FlgJN (which contains only the ®rst 151 amino acid residues) were recognized. Thus it appears that the N-

Salmonella Flagellar Rod Assembly

terminal region of FlgJ is responsible for the homologous interaction. Affinity blotting of FlgJ with N-His-FLAGtagged rod/hook proteins To check the results described above, where rod and hook proteins were used as targets, we carried out af®nity blotting in the reverse manner, with NHis-tagged FlgJ as the target, N-His-FLAG-tagged ¯agellar export substrates as probes, and antiFLAG antibody for detection. Figure 7(b) illustrates this for four probes, NHis-FLAG-FlgB, FlgG, FlgD and FlgE. N-HisFLAG-FlgB, FlgG and FlgD bound strongly to FlgJ, but not to a negative control, ovalbumin (panels 13). The same results were obtained with N-HisFLAG-FliE, FlgC and FlgF (data not shown). NHis-FLAG-FlgE showed a very weak interaction with FlgJ (panel 4), and N-His-FLAG-FliC showed no detectable interaction (data not shown). Retention of untagged FlgJ with His-tagged rod proteins on a Ni-NTA column Af®nity blotting data had shown interaction between FlgJ and the rod proteins. To further test for such interactions, we examined whether untagged FlgJ would be retained on a Ni-NTA column in the presence of various His-tagged proteins, namely the rod proteins, the hook capping FlgD, the hook protein FlgE, and the ®lament protein FliC. These alleles were cloned into pTrc99A as co-expression plasmids and used to transform BL21(DE3)pLysS. Overproduced proteins in the cell extract were denatured in 8 M urea and then dialyzed against binding buffer to allow for renaturation. After passing over a Ni-NTA column and washing with nine column volumes of 60 mM imidazole, the column was eluted with one column volume each of 100, 200, 300 and 600 mM imidazole. Proteins in these fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then stained with Coomassie. Peak

levels of His-tagged protein were always found in the 200 mM imidazole fraction. When probed with both anti-His and anti-FlgJ antibodies, untagged FlgJ was found to co-elute with His-tagged FliE, FlgB, FlgG, and (weakly) with FlgC and FlgE (Figure 8(a)). (In spite of the weakness of the Histagged-FliE band itself in Figure 8(a), lane 2, a consequence of degradation, it generates quite a strong co-eluting untagged FlgJ band (Figure 8(b), lane 2).) Untagged FlgJ also co-eluted with His-tagged FlgJ itself (the band at the FlgJ position in lane 8 is actually a closely spaced doublet). It also co-eluted

with FlgD (data not shown). FlgJ did not co-elute with His-tagged FlgF or FliC. Use of anti-FlgJ antibody alone con®rmed the identities of the FlgJ bands (Figure 8(b)). No untagged FlgJ was retained on the column in the absence of any His-tagged proteins (lane 1). These results support the physical interaction of FlgJ with the growing rod. They also con®rm the result obtained by af®nity blotting (Figure 5) that FlgJ binds strongly to itself.

Discussion
The ¯agellar morphogenetic pathway has been analyzed by examination of immature ¯agellar structures from mutant strains9,17 and by temperature-shift experiments with conditional mutants.20 Because ¯gJ mutants were found to only produce the MS ring, it was assumed that FlgJ was responsible for rod formation. However, the three mutants that were analyzed9,21 all produced only a short Nterminal fragment of FlgJ. Nambu et al. subsequently showed that the C-terminal domain of FlgJ is a ¯agellum-speci®c muramidase that can hydrolyze peptidoglycan.14 However, a plasmid producing FlgJ with a fully functional C-terminal domain but lacking the N-terminal domain of FlgJ completely fails to complement a ¯gJ null mutant host in swarm assays. This proves that muramidase activity alone cannot support ¯agellation of the cells. However, until now there has been no evidence to show the role of the N terminus of FlgJ. Here, we puri®ed immature ¯agellar structures from a ¯gJ null mutant harboring various plasmidencoded ¯gJ alleles and analyzed the structures morphologically by electron microscopy. We also tested for direct physical interaction of FlgJ with several rod proteins. We have provided evidence that suggests that the role of FlgJ in the ¯agellar morphological pathway is twofold. In one role its N-terminal region functions as a rod capping protein, and in the other role its C-terminal region functions as a ¯agellum-speci®c muramidase

working at the tip of the growing rod structure to penetrate the physical barrier of the peptidoglycan layer. The role of FlgJ as a flagellumspecific muramidase Gram-negative bacteria have three kinds of barriers within their cell surface, the inner or cytoplasmic membrane, the peptidoglycan layer, and

the outer membrane. The peptidoglycan layer in the periplasmic space plays an important role in maintaining cell shape, especially under low osmotic conditions. FlgJ, which hydrolyzes peptidoglycan, is exported to the periplasm through the ¯agellar type III protein export system.14 This suggests that its muramidase activity should be controlled both spatially (at the tip of the nascent rod) and temporally (during rod growth). Consistent with this, we have shown physical interaction of FlgJ with the rod proteins, especially the proximal ones. We have also shown that though muramidase activity is not necessary for export of substrates to the periplasm (Figure 4(b) and ref. 19), it is necessary for completion of the rod and penetration of the outer membrane so that substrates can be exported to the external medium (Figure 4(a)). Some plasmids harboring mutant ¯gJ analyzed in this study showed leaky phenotype. After prolonged incubation on a swarm plate, a small but signi®cant degree of swarming was observed (Figure 2). All of these mutants had the ability to construct a basal body lacking only the L ring. Apparently, this structure occasionally and fortuitously ®nds a hole in the peptidoglycan layer by chance; when it does so, it proceeds to assemble a ¯agellum that includes the outer membrane L ring (see example in right panel of Figure 3(c)). FlgJ homologs from some other Gram-negative bacteria (Vibrio spp.,22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa23), like FlgJ of Salmonella, possess both an N-terminal ¯agellum-speci®c domain and a C-terminal muramidase domain. However, FlgJ of Rhodobacter appears to have only the N-terminal ¯agellumspeci®c domain and no C-terminal muramidase Â domain (Bertha Gonzalez-Pedrajo, personal communication; accession number AAG29752). The reason for this difference is not clear. Surprisingly, no FlgJ homolog has been reported in Grampositive bacteria, in spite of the fact that they have a thick, rigid peptidoglycan structure.

367 tally, is consistent with the idea of a multimeric capping structure, such as exists for the ®lament capping protein, FliD.8,31 Both FlgJ (Figure 1) and the ®lament capping protein FliD4 share the feature of a short but distinct predicted a-helical coiled-coil region near their C termini. In the case of FlgJ, we have shown that this is important for motility and the ability to export to the culture supernatant. One can imagine that these regions might function to engage in a coiled-coil arrangement with the N termini of their substrates (rod proteins or ¯agellin, respectively). However, for unknown reasons, the hook capping protein, FlgD, lacks such a feature. It is dif®cult to imagine that, without a capping protein, rod proteins can assemble into rod structure. In our experimental conditions, the interactions of FlgJ with FlgG and FlgF were quite weak. If FlgJ had two different conformational states, for example induced by muramidase activity, it might be possible to recognize these proteins. P and L ring assembly in the basal body structure The P ring, like the L ring, is exported by the signal-peptide dependent Sec secretory pathway,32 ± 34 and is assembled into the basal body structure with the help of a periplasmic chaperone, FlgA,35 and disul®de bond forming proteins, DsbA and DsbB.36 It has generally been assumed, based on its location in the periplasmic space, that the P ring is embedded into the peptidoglycan layer, although there is no clear evidence that this is the case, or even what is meant by the term embedded. Nambu et al.14 suggested that the muramidase activity of FlgJ might be needed for P ring formation. However, our data show that the P ring can assemble onto the basal body even in the absence of the muramidase activity of FlgJ to give a structure which looks similar to the candlestick structure seen with ¯gH (L ring) mutants;17 we did not see rivet structures, lacking the P ring, such as are seen for ¯gI (P ring) and ¯gA (P-ring chaperone) mutants. Thus P-ring assembly appears to precede peptidoglycan penetration by the rod, and suggests that the P ring is physically associated with the peptidoglycan layer only in the sense that it lies beneath it and perhaps pushes up against it. In contrast, formation of the L ring appears to be dependent on the muramidase activity of FlgJ, with the quali®cation that some degree of bypass is possible, perhaps by fortuitous holes created during peptidoglycan growth. The role of FlgJ as a dual function protein in the flagellar morphological pathway Based on the results of this study and that of Nambu et al.,14 we propose that FlgJ is a dual function protein. One function is that, although it remains to be demonstrated directly, almost half of the protein at its C terminus must play a role in

The ¯agellar protein export pathway belongs to the same family as the type III pathways for export of virulence factors by bacterial pathogens. Recently, the corresponding export machineries (needle complexes, or NCs) of Salmonella SPI-1)24 ± 26 and Shigella27,28 have been characterized. Although formation of the needle itself requires a functioning type III system (including, for example, the ATPase), assembly of the base structure (i.e. the structure without the needle) does not. This base structure appears quite similar to the ¯agellar basal body, which does require type III export for its formation. It appears that the base structure of the NC may be formed by direct association of an inner membrane structure and an outer membrane structure, employing only the Sec machinery. This raises the question of how the structure penetrates the peptidoglycan layer. Salmonella has a putative muramidase, IagB, that is part of the SPI-1 type III system.26 However, it lacks an N-terminal domain homologous to that seen in FlgJ. How, or even whether, IagB functions in the type III virulence export pathway is unclear, since iagB mutants assemble apparently normal needle complexes. The possible role of FlgJ as a rod scaffold protein We suggest that the N-terminal domain of FlgJ (ca. residues 1-151) may have a rod capping ability. There are two known examples of capping proteins in the ¯agellar morphological pathway, FliD for the ¯agellar ®lament and FlgD for the hook. Their common feature is that both cap structures help to assemble the corresponding monomeric proteins into axial structure at the distal end. However, if the N terminus of FlgJ is a general rod cap, it would need to recognize at least four different rod proteins (FlgB, FlgC, FlgF and FlgG) at the correct assembly stage. All of these proteins are members of the axial family29 and the rod structure might be assembled as a helical subunit array of these proteins. FlgB and FlgG are components of proximal and distal rod, respectively.3,30 The position of FlgC and FlgF in rod structure has not been shown experimentally. Our data showed FlgJ having the strongest and most consistent interactions with FliE, FlgB and FlgJ itself (Figures 5-7); however, depending on the assay, FlgC, FlgG, FlgF and FlgD also interacted with FlgJ. FlgE (hook protein) and FliC (¯agellin) interacted very weakly, if at all. FliE is needed for the export of other type III substrates,19 and is postulated to form a junction zone between the MS ring and the rod. Intergenic suppression evidence indicates that the FliE and FlgB substructures are adjacent.3 Thus, although the details are still not clear, the available evidence supports the hypothesis that FlgJ is a rod capping protein as well as a muramidase, and plays an especially important role in early rod formation. Its N-terminal domain appears to be central in this role, since it is both necessary and suf®cient for rod formation. The self-association of FlgJ, inciden-

The other is that, as we showed here, the N terminus of FlgJ from position 1 to 151 seems to function as a scaffold or cap for rod assembly, although the precise positioning and duration of FlgJ association is still unclear.

The soluble fraction was loaded onto a 3 ml Ni-NTA agarose column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer and washed with 27 ml of binding buffer containing 60 mM imidazole. The proteins were eluted with 3 ml each of binding buffer containing 100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM and 600 mM imidazole. The peak fraction of most of His-tagged proteins was at 200 mM imidazole. Recovered un-tagged FlgJ proteins were analyzed by SDSPAGE, Coomassie staining and immunoblotting.

Experimental Procedures
Bacterial strains, plasmids, media and chemicals The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. L broth (LB) and soft tryptone agar plates were prepared as described previously.19 Ovalbumin was from Amersham Pharmacia; LDAO from CalBiochem; M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma. DNA manipulations Procedures for DNA manipulation in vitro were carried out as described previously.37 pTrc99A-based plasmids co-overproducing both His-tagged various proteins and FlgJ were constructed as described previously.37 Preparation of basal body structures Because of the leaky phenotype of ¯gJ mutants, cells were inoculated into LB within 16 hours after transformation by pET-19b based plasmid and incubated at 37  C for ®ve hours as a pre-culture. Then 1/100 of pre-cultured cell were inoculated into one liter of LB and incubated at 37  C with shaking at 220 rpm for three hours. After harvesting the cells, basal body structures were puri®ed as described previously38 with the following minor modi®cations. The detergent LDAO, was used instead of Triton X-100. After CsCl density gradient centrifugation, 2 ml fractions from top to bottom of the tube were collected and diluted by TEL (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 % LDAO, pH 8.0). Basal body structures were collected by centrifugation at 180,000 g for one hour and rinsed with distilled water. The pellet was suspended in 50 ml of TEL and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy and SDS-PAGE. Affinity blotting Af®nity blotting was carried out as described previously.37 Ni-NTA affinity chromatography pull down assays 1 ml of overnight culture of BL21 DE3 pLysS carrying various pTrc99A-based co-overproduction plasmids was inoculated into 100 ml of LB containing ampicillin and grown exponentially at 37  C with shaking. Then IPTG was added to a ®nal concentration of 1 mM, and the culture incubated a further ®ve hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were suspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 0.5 M NaCl) which contained 8 M urea and sonicated (model 450 Soni®er; Branson Ultrasonics). Undisrupted cells were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were dialyzed three times against 1 l of binding buffer. Re-aggregated proteins were removed by centrifugation and 0.45 mm ®ltration.
