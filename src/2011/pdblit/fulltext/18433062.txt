ABSTRACT The crystal structure of the DFA0005 protein complexed with a-ketoglutarate (AKG) from an alkali-tolerant bacterium Deinococcus ficus has been determined to a resolution of ° 1.62 A. The monomer forms an incomplete a7/b8 barrel with a protruding a8 helix that interacts extensively with another subunit to form a stable dimer of two complete a8/b8 barrels. The dimer is further stabilized by four glycerol molecules situated at the interface. One unique AKG ligand binding pocket per subunit is detected. Fold match using the DALI and SSE servers identifies DFA0005 as belonging to the isocitrate lyase/phosphoenolpyruvate mutase (ICL/PEPM) superfamily. However, further detailed structural and sequence comparison with other members in this superfamily and with other families containing AKG ligand indicate that DFA0005 protein exhibits considerable distinguishing features of its own and can be considered a novel member in this ICL/PEPM superfamily.

INTRODUCTION The pale-pink alkali-tolerant Deinococcus ficus (DF strain CC-FR210T) is a novel bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of the sacred tree Ficus religiosa L.1 It is found to possess high degrading power for food and organic waste at pH 10 and is being applied to industrial usage. It contains one chromosome of 2,801,970 bp, and three megaplasmids of 642,681, 395,118, and 311,736 bp, respectively. The total genome sequence has been recently completed (Lin et al., manuscript in preparation), and a structural genomics project is followed to study the structures of proteins encoded in this genome and to study the alkali adaptation mechanism exhibited by this alkali-tolerant bacterium compared with their non-alkaline counterparts.2,3 The crystal structure of DFA0005 gene product from this bacterium ° complexed with AKG ligand is solved to a resolution of 1.62 A using the MAD approach of X-ray crystallography. Fold matching search using the secondary structure matching (SSM)4 or Dali5 program identifies DFA0005 as a member of the ICL/PEPM superfamily, including enzymes such as ICL (isocitrate lyase, involved in the glyoxylate cycle),6 MICL (2methylisocitrate lyase, involved in the propionate catabolism),7­9 PEPM (phosphoenolpyruvate mutase, involved in the unusual CÀ ÀP bond

formation present in a variety of antibiotic, antifungal, and herbicidal compounds such as fosfoymcin, amioethyl phosphonate conjugate etc.),10­13 carboxy-PEPM (carboxyphosphoenolpyruvate mutase, involved in the bialaphos synthesis),14­16 PEPH (phosphonopyruvate hydrolase, involved in the formation of pyruvate),17 and MOBL (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase, involved in the formation of ketopantoate).18,19 Although diverse in functions, they all bind substrates with a conserved a-hydroxy- or a-keto-carboxylate moiety.20,21 Thus, they all contain conserved amino acid residues for interacting with the common moiety in a wide variety of substrates, including citrate, 2-methylisocitrate, phosphonopyruvate, 3-methyl-oxobutanoate, and so forth. It is believed that the functional diversity within the ICL/PEPM superfamily is even greater than currently known, since many uncharacterized proteins with potentially different activities have been obtained from sequence analysis.9,20 In this respect, we report the discovery of a novel member in this superfamily from the alkali-tolerant bacterium Deinococcus ficus. It encodes a protein (DFA0005) that retains a similar core structure with those of the ICL/PEPM superfamily, but exhibits many distinguishing features of its own: (a) it has a deeply penetrated AKG binding pocket, not observed in the ICL/PEPM superfamily or any other enzyme/AKG complexes published to date8,9,11,13,17; (b) the ligand pocket contains many characteristic polar residues to bind the tail carboxylate moiety of AKG in an orientation different from all other tail moieties of the substrates currently observed in the ICL/PEPM superfamily; (c) it does not contain any metal ion as usually required for the head HOOCÀ ÀCO moiety binding7,8,13; (d) the binding pocket does not encompass a characteristic long b4-a4 loop necessary for gating the substrate binding and product release commonly exploited in this superfamily9,13; and (e) it exists as a dimer, not a tetramer or pentamer as usually observed in the MICL/PEPM superfamily members.10 METHODS
Cloning and purification

K for 24 h. The target protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) on a nickel column (Sigma). The His6 tag and linker were cleaved from DFA0005 by TEV (Tobacco Etch Virus) protease at 291 K for 24 h. For crystallization, DFA0005 was further purified on an anion exchanger column (AKTA, Pharmacia). The final target protein has purity greater than 99% and contains only an extra tripeptide (SNA) at the N-terminal end. Se-Met labeled DFA0005 was produced using a non-auxotroph E. coli strain C41 as host in the absence of methionine but with ample amounts of Se-met (100 mg/L). The M9 medium consists of 1 g of NH4Cl, 3 g of KH2PO4, and 6 g of Na2HPO4 supplemented with 20% (W/V) of glucose, 0.3% (W/V) of MgSO4, and 10 mg of FeSO4 in 1 L of double-distilled water. The induction was conducted at 188C for 24 h by the addition of 1 mL of 0.5 mM IPTG. Purification of the Se-Met labeled DFA0005 was performed using the protocols as established for the native protein.
Crystallization

For crystallization, the native protein was concentrated to 14 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 80 mM NaCl using an Amicon Ultra-10 (Millipore). Screening for crystallization condition was performed using sittingdrop vapor diffusion in 96-well plates (Hampton Research) at 295 K by mixing 0.5 lL protein solution with 0.5 lL reagent solution. Initial screens including the Hampton sparse matrix Crystal Screens 1 and 2, a systematic PEG-pH screen and a PEG/Ion screen were performed using the Gilson C240 crystallization workstation. Oval-like crystals appeared in one day from a reservoir solution comprising 0.1M Na Hepes pH 7.5, lithium sulfate monohydrate 1.5 M. Crystals suitable for diffraction experiments were grown by mixing 2.0 lL protein solution with 2.0 lL reagent solution at room temperature and reached dimensions of 0.5 3 0.2 3 0.1 mm after 1 day. Se-Met labeled DFA0005 was crystallized in a similar way, except 1.3 M of lithium sulfate monohydrate was used. Although crystals did not appear sharp, the diffrac° tion pattern turned out to be good to 1.68 A.
Data collection

The DFA0005 gene fragment was PCR amplified directly from the local alkali-tolerant Deinococcus ficus (DF strain CC-FR2-10T) with the forward 50 - TACTT CCAATCCAATGCTATGACCCACGCCGATCACGCCCGC and backward 50 -TTATCCACTTCCAATGTTACGCGGT GGGGCGGTGGAAGAGGT primers. A ligation-independent cloning (LIC) approach22,23 was carried out to obtain the desired construct. The final construct codes for a N-terminal His6 tag, a 17 amino acid linker, and a DFA0005 target protein (275 aa) under the control of a T7 promoter. Over-expression of the Hig6-tag target protein was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG at 291

Crystals were flash-cooled at 100 K under a stream of cold nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) beamline 13B1 in Taiwan. A two-wavelength ° MAD data set up to 1.62 A resolution was obtained. The data were indexed and integrated using HKL2000 processing software,24 giving data set that are $99% complete with Rmerge of 5.9%/6.6% for all intensities and 38%/46% for the last resolution range. The refinement of selenium atom positions, phase calculation, and density modification were performed using the program SOLVE/

RESULTS
Overall quality

DFA0005 is one of the gene products encoded by the mega-plasmid A of this bacterium. Its structure [Fig. ° 1(a)] has been determined to a resolution of 1.62 A using the MAD approach. The data collection, model, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. The electron density map is well interpretable from residue 4 to the end of residue 277. Two additional electron density regions are found to which the glycerol molecule can fit very well [Fig. 1(b)]. It is reasonable since glycerol was employed as the cryoprotectant in this experiment. However, an unexpected well-defined electron density region is also recognized, to which only AKG molecule can fit [Figs. 1(b) and 3(b)]. The final model of DFA0005 [Fig. 1(a)] thus comprises one protein molecule of 274 residue long, 337 water, two glycerol, and one AKG molecules. The Matthew's coefficient for DFA0005 is 2.1 A3/Da and the estimated solvent content is 53%. Examination of the

Ramachandran plot calculated from the PdbViewer27 shows that 95.7% of the residues of nonglycine and nonproline residues are in the most favored regions, with 2.9% of the residues in the additional allowed regions. Four residues (1.5%) are found to deviate from the allowed torsional angles. The side chains of Glu87 are found in the mouth of the water channel, and participate in the H-bonding network leading to the AKG binding pocket [Fig. 4(b)]. Gln60 and Thr61, opposite to Glu87, also locate in the mouth of the water channel. The side chain of Thr61 participates in H-bonding with one water molecule in the channel, and its amino group forms a H-bond with the carbonyl group of Gly59. The participation of these amino acid residues in the H-bonding network may lead to the deviation of their backbone torsion angles from the ideal values. Finally, the side chain of Glu168 in the top of a5 helix forms a H-bond with the carbonyl group of Gly163 in the b5-a5 loop. The deviation of backbone torsion angles of Ala164 in the Gly163Ala164Thr165 bulge may be necessary to reverse the chain direction from b5 to a5.

Dimeric structure

DFA0005 packs in the crystal as a dimer [Fig. 1(b)], with each monomer adopting a modified version of a/b barrel.10 In this modified a/b barrel, only seven helices

were found to embrace the central b barrel. The eighth helix protrudes from the barrel [Fig. 1(a)], which, along with the two ensuing helices (a9 and a10), mediate the helical swapping with another subunit [Fig. 1(b)]. The strayed helix of one monomer thus forms the eighth helix of the second monomer, and vice versa. This helical swapping beautifully mediates the tight dimeric association to form two complete a/b barrels. The N-terminal end of the barrel is blocked by a helix a0 that traverses the bottom of the barrel [Fig. 1(a,b)]. The dimeric state of DFA0005 in solution was ascertained both by gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifuge studies (data not shown). The protein­protein interaction server (PPIS) was used to ° analyze the dimer interface.28,29 Roughly 20% (2603 A2) of solvent-accessible surface area of each subunit is buried upon dimer formation. The majority of contacting residues is contributed from those located in helices a1/a20

and helices a8/a9/a10 protruding toward the second subunit. Interactions are extensive, including a total of ° 17 polar contacts within a 3.8 A distance limit and 46 ° distance limit between nonpolar contacts within a 5.0 A protein atoms. Although no salt bridge is found within a ° 4.0 A distance limit, six H-bonds are detected, including ° the Ala27HN(A)-Ala50C¼ ¼O(B) (2.92 A), Arg219NH1(A)e1 ° ), and Gln244Ne2(A)-Glu268Oe1(B) Glu254O (B) (2.70 A ° (3.08 A) atom pairs, and vice versa. Other than these interactions, four glycerol molecules [circled in red in Fig. 1(b)] situated between the two subunits are found which greatly improve the dimer stability. Two are located in the cavities formed between the b1-a1 loops and the a80 helix, forming five additional H-bonds between the O1-Asp25Od(B), O3-Thr239Og(A), O2(A)-O2(B) atom pairs, while another two are located in the cavities formed between the b7-a7 loops and the a8/a9 helices, forming 10 more H-bonds between

Comparison with other ICL/PEPM superfamily proteins

A structural fold and homolog search performed by the DALI5 and SSM4,30 servers using the final model DFA0005 coordinates generates a number of structural homologues, all belonged to the ICL/PEPM superfamily. A multiple structural alignment was carried out for some representing structures using the MUSTANG program,31 with their resulting sequence alignments displayed in Figure 2(a) and structural superimposition in Figure 3(a). The pairwise sequence identity percentages of DFA0005 with 2QIW, IM1B, 2HJP, 1O5Q, 1XG4, and 1M3U are 33.0, 28.4, 31.3, 31.5, 30.6, and 26.7% respectively, while the rmsd values of superimposition of DFA0005 structure with those of 2QIW, IM1B, 2HJP, 1O5Q, 1XG4, and ° 1M3U are 1.30, 1.28, 1.38, 1.30, 1.27, and 1.70 A, for 212, 196, 200, 201, 209, and 153 Cas, respectively. These data indicate that DFA0005 is likely a member of the ICL/PEPM superfamily, and is more close to 2QIW but more distant from 1M3U. However, several significant differences in the loop positions for DFA0005 are detected after the alignment of these protein structures [Fig. 3(a)]; (a) the a2-a20 loop in DFA0005 exhibits a distinct twist from all other loops in the ICL/PEPM superfamily members, although their loop length are similar; (b) the b4-a4 loop in DFA0005 is rather short and cannot exhibit the conformational flexibility necessary for gating the ligand entrance/exit characteristic of the PEPM/PEPH/MICL/ICL family. The most significant difference of DFA0005 with other ICL/PEPM superfamily members is the unique AKG ligand binding pocket present in the DFA0005 that will be described in the following paragraph.
Unique AKG ligand and water channel

Besides the glycerol molecules, one AKG molecule per subunit is found to locate within the barrel [circled in green in Fig. 1(b)], which is clearly identified from the Fo 2 Fc electron density map as shown in Figure 3(b). It must be a native ligand for DFA0005 since no AKG was added extrinsically during cultivation, protein purification, or crystallization. The head moiety (HOOC-CO) of AKG is situated at the top of the barrel, and the C3-C6 tail moiety (CH2CH2COOH) penetrating toward the bottom of the barrel, forming a well-established binding pocket [Fig. 3(c)]. Interestingly, most head moiety (HOOCÀ ÀCO) of ligands in the ICL/PEPM superfamily

are found to superimpose okay [circled in red in Fig. 3(d)], except that of the ketopantoate of MOBL (colored in gray). However, their tail moieties are found to deviate significantly toward three different directions; upward for isocitrate, sulfopyruvate, and phosphoenolpyruvate, horizontal for ketopantoate, and downward for AKG. A well formed water channel, an extensive H-bonding network, and a number of unique amino acid residues around the AKG ligand are associated with the unique orientation of the AKG ligand. Such results clearly indicate that DFA0005 is a special protein in the ICL/PEPM superfamily and the unique AKG binding in DFA0005 is not an artifact. The hydrophilic water channel, comprising at least fourteen well visible water molecules, is found situated on top of the mouth of the b-barrel [Fig. 4(a)]. Close-up of the channel [Fig. 4(b)] shows an extensive H-bond network for the water molecules. Two deeply buried water molecules are found in the bottom of the AKG binding pocket. The detailed interactions between the water molecules, the AKG, and the surrounding amino acid residues in the pocket are shown in the Ligplot scheme of [Fig. 4(c)]; while the head AKG moiety interacts with three conserved amino acid residues (Asp82, Glu112, and Arg151, marked in solid red circles in Fig. 2) either directly or indirectly, the tail carboxylate moiety interacts with several polar side chains located in the bottom of the binding pocket. Thus Thr42 in strand b2, Asn80 in b3, Asn110 in b4, Asn208 in b7, and Arg228 in b8 all form one indirect H-bond through the deeply buried water molecules, and Ser230 in b8 forms one direct H-bond, with the tail carboxylate oxygen atoms. Residues in strands b5 and b6 contribute no Hbond since they are too far away from the tail carboxylate oxygen atoms. Importantly, most hydrophobic residues situated at the bottom of the b-barrel in other ICL/ PEPM superfamily have been replaced by polar residues to interact with the tail carboxylate moiety and the two deeply buried water molecules in DFA0005. Thus Leu/Ile/ Val residues in position 80 of b3 strand, His/Val/Cys residues in position 110 of b4 strand, Leu/Val/Ile residues in position 208 of b7 strand, Met/Ile/Leu residues in position 228 of b8 strand, and Leu/Ile/Ala residues in position 230 of b8 strand have been replaced with polar residues of Asn, Asn, Asn, Arg, and Ser, respectively [marked by solid blue circles in Fig. 2 and boxed in Fig. 4(c)] to accommodate the very polar tail carboxylate moiety of AKG.. The well-established H-bond interaction network in this ligand binding pocket can explain the good visibility of the AKG ligand in the DFA0005 Fo 2 Fc electron density map [Fig. 3(b)]. Furthermore, we also find one critical residue that may partially account for the fact that this pocket in DFA0005 is not suitable for ligand binding in other ICL/PEPM superfamily members. The critical position 41 (boxed in reverse in Fig. 2) is originally occupied by very bulky residues such as Trp/Tyr/Leu. They have now been

DISCUSSION After the crystal structure of the DFA0005 gene product from the novel alkaliphilic Deinococcus ficus was determined, it was submitted to the ProFunc server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/ProFunc/)30 to help delineate its function. The BLAST search against the UniProt database returns sequences as belonging to the phosphonoenolpyruvate phosphonomutase-like protein (A5G4A7), carboxyphosphonoenolpyruvate phosphonomutase-like proteins (Q8F693) or putative uncharacterized proteins (Q72PY6, A5NWK7, and A1RBE9) with high sequence identities above 40%. Fold matching search by the SSM4 program returns structures in the ICL/PEPM superfamily (2qiw, 1oqf, 1xg4, 1mum, 1xg3, 2hrw, 2dua, 2hjp, 1zlp) with Z-score above 10 and ° RMSD values ranging from 1.25 to 1.45 A. The sequence identities are in the gray area of 32.9%­27.0%. So far all these data seem to indicate that DFA0005 belongs to the ICL/PEPM superfamily. Nevertheless, the conserved signature sequences of Trp44Gly45Ser46Gly47 for the PEPM/PEPH family and of Tyr43Leu44Ser45Gly46 for the ICL/MICL family (boxed in the b2-a20 region Fig. 2) are not found in DFA0005, nor is the Lys120Thr121Asn122Ser123Leu124 sequence for the PEPM family, Lys116Asp117Thr1182Ser119Leu120 sequence for the PEPH family, Lys121Arg122Cys123Gly124His125Arg126 sequence for the MICL family or the Lys124Arg125Ser126Gly127His128Arg129 sequence for the ICL family (boxed in the b4-a4 region Fig. 2).9,13,17 These characteristic features, along with the absence of a long flexible b4-a4 loop for gating the ligand entrance or exit of the ICL/PEPM superfamily proteins [indicated by the blue and red arrows in Fig. 3(a)], indicate that DFA0005 does not belong to the ICL/MICL/PEPM/PEPH family. Compared with MOBL, although both DFA0005/MOBL have a short L4 and a long L5 loops, the L4 loop in MOBL is even shorter, and the L5 loop much longer (see Fig. 2). Interestingly, the long L5 loop of MOBL has occupied the same space originally taken by the long L4 loops in the ICL/PEPM family [indicated by the gray arrow in Fig. 3(a)]. MOBL also has a much longer a8 helix located at a different position with other superfamily members [the gray helix at the lower right of Fig. 3(a)], and forms a pentamer either with19 or without18 an a8 helix domain swapping. These, along with the different ligand binding pocket described below [Fig. 3(d)], indicate that DFA0005 is less likely a MOBL (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase)20 or KPHMT (ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase)18,19 type protein.

The story turns even more bizarre when an unexpected and well-defined electron density region is revealed in the final map. At first, all known substrate/inhibitor/ ligand in the ICL/PEPM superfamily such as pyruvate, oxalate, succinate and/or isocitrate8,9,11,13,17 were tried to fit the map. However, none of them seems to fit. This electron density region seems to be long enough to accommodate five carbon atoms with a branching at the second position. Finally, AKG was tested for fitting since it is a moderate inhibitor (Ki of 0.9 mM) for the T. pyriformis and S. hygroscopicus phosphoenolpyruvate mutase in the ICL/PEPM superfamily.12 Indeed, it was finally found to fit into the map very well. Another surprise came when the binding residues of AKG of DFA0005 are compared with other AKG binding residues in this superfamily. As shown in Figure 3(d), the tail moiety (CH2CH2COOH) of AKG is found to penetrate toward the bottom of the barrel and locate at a position significantly different from the tail moieties of other ligands in this superfamily, although the head moiety of AKG (HOOCÀ ¼O) can still superimpose. In ÀC¼ other words, the ligands of other classical ICL/PEPM superfamily seem to ``float'' on the top of the barrel, while the AKG ligand in DFA0005 seems to ``penetrate'' into the bottom of the barrel instead. Structural alignment of DFA0005 with other ICL/PEPM superfamily reveals that residues Asp82, Glu112, and Arg151 (based on the DFA0005 numbering system) interacting with the head HOOCÀ ¼O moiety are conserved, while resiÀC¼ dues interacting with the tail moiety of the various ligands are very different [Fig. 4(c)]. Unlike the hydrophobic residues employed in the ICL/PEPM superfamily, those present in DFA0005 have been changed to polar residues, that is His/Val/Cys?Asn110, Leu/Val/Ile? Asn208, Met/Ile/Leu/Sser?Arg228, Leu/Ile/Val?Asn80, and Leu/Ile/Ala?Ser230 [Figs. 2 and 4(c)]. Furthermore, one bulky residue (Trp, Tyr or Leu) in the ICL/PEPM superfamily has been mutated to a Gly residue to leave room for the entry of the long tail moiety of the AKG ligand in DFA0005. Electrostatic plot of DFA0005 indicates that the bottom of the AKG binding pocket is highly positive, ready to accept AKG into the binding pocket [Fig. 3(c)]. From the above descriptions, DFA0005 seems to contain many distinguishing features of its own, and can be classified as a novel member in this ICL/PEPM superfamily. From sequence and structural comparison, DFA0005 is more similar to 2QIW recently deposited in PDB. Although 2QIW lacks the C-terminal a9 and a10 helices (see Fig. 2), it has similar lengths in most loops with those of DFA0005. And importantly, they contain similar polar residues around the AKG binding pocket (see Fig. 2). Although 2QIW has a Thr44 in the critical Gly41 position, this amino acid is possibly not bulky enough to block the AKG entrance [colored by purple in Fig. 3(d)]. So 2QIW is still possible to accommodate the AKG

ligand in the same binding pocket. However, the details of 2QIW are not published yet, and 2QIW is temporarily annotated as a putative PEPM with no ligand found in the electron density map. Finally, it is interesting to see if DFA0005 is similar to proteins in other superfamily observed to date that also contain an AKG ligand. PDB search for complexes containing AKG returns four major enzyme families unrelated to the ICL/PEPM superfamily; that is the glutamate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, aminotransferase, and dioxygenase families. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of glutamate to AKG with the help of a NAD1 cofactor. It is a regular a/b protein, with AKG product bound in a pocket enclosed by two helices and three b-strands (1HWY).32 However, no NAD1 cofactor is found for DFA0005. Isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of isocitrate to oxalosuccinate which further undergoes decarboxylation to AKG. It is mainly an open twisted b-sheet protein packed by a number of a-helices at both sides of the bsheet (1IKA).33 Aminotransferase catalyzes amino group transfer reactions, and in many such reactions, AKG serves as the amino group acceptor. All aminotransferases incorporate pyridoxal phosphate as the cofactor. However, in the aspartate aminotransferase (1AIB),34 one of the aminotransferase families, the tail moiety of AKG is found to open to the solvent. Finally, a family of dioxygenases uses AKG as a cofactor to carry out various oxidation and reduction reactions through a ferrous ion. A typical one is the non-haem iron halogenase SyrB2 involved in the syringomycin biosynthesis (2FCU).35 Although the AKG cofactor of SyrB2 can overlap with that of DFA0005, there is no ferrous ion found in DFA0005. Importantly, in all these four families, amino acid residues surrounding the AKG binding pocket are very different from those of DFA0005, and do not seem to superimpose at all except for the bound AKG ligand (figure not shown). DFA0005 thus contains a novel binding pocket for AKG that is completely different from those published to date in the PDB. In conclusion, DFA0005 from the alkali-tolerant Deinococcus ficus belongs to the ICL/PEPM superfamily, but contains a novel AKG ligand binding pocket unknown until to date. It can be considered a novel member in this superfamily, but needs biochemical data to identify its function. The chemical identity of AKG is also not confirmed yet.
