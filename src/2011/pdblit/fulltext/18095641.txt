To develop potent transthyretin (TTR) amyloidogenesis inhibitors that also display high binding selectivity in blood, it proves useful to systematically optimize each of the three substructural elements that comprise a typical inhibitor: the two aryl rings and the linker joining them. In the first study, described herein, structural modifications to one aryl ring were evaluated by screening a library of 2-arylbenzoxazoles bearing thyroid hormone-like aryl substituents on the 2-aryl ring. Several potent and highly selective amyloidogenesis inhibitors were identified that exhibit minimal thyroid hormone nuclear receptor and COX-1 binding. High resolution crystal structures (1.3­1.5 Å) of three inhibitors (2f, 4f, and 4d) in complex with TTR were obtained to characterize their binding orientation. Collectively, the results demonstrate that thyroid hormonelike substitution patterns on one aryl ring lead to potent and highly selective TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors that lack undesirable thyroid hormone receptor or COX-1 binding.
Introduction Transthyretin (TTRa) is one of more than 25 diseaseassociated secreted human proteins that misfolds and misassembles into a variety of extracellular aggregate morphologies, including fibrillar cross- -sheet structures known as amyloid. The native, tetrameric structure of TTR must first dissociate for the resulting monomers to partially unfold and misassemble into aggregates, including amyloid.1,2 Substantial genetic and biochemical evidence link the process of TTR amyloid formation (amyloidogenesis), involving numerous assembly intermediates of variable morphology, to the tissue degeneration, including neurodegeneration, prevalent in senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC), familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), and central nervous system selective amyloidosis (CNSA).1,3­6 FAP, FAC, and CNSA are familial diseases caused by the aberrant amyloidogenesis of one of >100 destabilized TTR mutants. These diseases can present as early as the second decade of life but typically present in the fourth to fifth decade. In contrast, SSA is a late onset disease associated with aggregation of wild type transthyretin (WT-TTR), typically presenting in the seventh to eighth decade. Without treatment, the TTR amyloidoses are fatal. The liver secretes TTR into the blood, which later is envisioned to undergo amyloidogenesis. The only treatment currently available for FAP is gene therapy mediated by liver transplantation, whereby the FAP mutant TTR/WT-TTR secreting liver is replaced by a WT-TTR/WT-TTR secreting liver. This procedure dramatically decreases plasma mutant TTR levels and halts disease progression in most patients, at least

initially.7­9 In addition to the requirement for life-long immune suppression, another drawback of this strategy is that WT-TTR deposition often continues post-transplantation in the heart, leading to cardiomyopathy.10 Liver transplantation is not envisioned to be effective for the treatment of SSA because this disease is caused by WT-TTR deposition. Because of these limitations, an alternative, generally applicable, oral small molecule therapy for all the TTR-based amyloid diseases is highly desirable.4 Transthyretin transports the vitamin A-retinol binding protein (RBP) complex and thyroxine (T4) in blood. Because of the high concentration of TTR and the presence of two other thyroxine carrier proteins (thyroxine binding globulin and albumin), <1% of the thyroxine binding sites in the TTR tetramers are bound to T4. TTR is composed of 127-amino acid, -sheet-rich subunits that associate into a homotetrameric quaternary structure exhibiting two unique dimer­dimer interfaces (Figure 1).4,11­15 The energetically weaker interface creates two funnel-shaped thyroxine binding pockets. Allosteric communication between the two binding sites causes thyroxine to bind with negative cooperativity, the structural basis of which is not entirely clear.4,16,17 Each T4 binding site contains three pairs of symmetric hydrophobic depressions, referred to as the halogen binding pockets (HBPs), wherein the iodine atoms of T4 reside (Figure 1).18 One pair is located in each of the smaller inner and larger outer binding cavities, while the third is found at the interface between the two cavities. Numerous small molecules, typically composed of two differentially substituted aromatic rings connected by linkers of variable chemical composition (Figure 2), are known to avidly bind to the unoccupied T4 sites within TTR (displaying either positive-, non-, or negative-cooperativity).4 One aryl ring typically bears polar substituents that enable electrostatic interactions with the Lys-15 -NH3+ and/or the Glu-54 carboxy groups positioned at the periphery of the outer cavity of the T4 binding site. Alternatively, these groups can hydrogen bond with the Ser-117 or Thr-119 hydroxyls in the inner cavity when bound in the opposite binding orientation. The other aryl substructure generally displays halogen or alkyl substituents that

Y represents a linker of variable chemical structure (e.g., NH, O, CHdCH, C(O)NH, etc.) joining the two aryl rings, which typically bear a combination of alkyl, carboxyl, halide, trifluoromethyl, or hydroxyl substituents (X and Z).

Crystal structure (2ROX) of thyroxine (T4) bound within the two pockets created by the weak dimer­dimer interface of tetrameric TTR (the two dimer­dimer interfaces are represented by the dashed lines).18 The expanded view of one site shows T4 bound in its symmetry-related binding modes (green and yellow), with the binding site surface shown in gray (figure adapted from ref 18). Primed amino acids or halogen binding pockets (HBPs) refer to symmetry-related monomers of TTR. Two structural series of inhibitors are shown above, the bisaryloxime ethers and biphenyls (R ) variable substitution patterns of fluorine, chlorine, trifluoromethyl, carboxyl, or hydroxyl substituents), many of which are excellent TTR kinetic stabilizers that display high plasma TTR binding selectivity.25

complement the hydrophobic HBPs positioned in the inner or outer cavities of the T4 binding sites. Small molecule binding to the T4 sites can noncovalently bridge neighboring monomeric subunits via specific hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, stabilizing the weaker dimer­dimer interface (Figure 1). This imposes kinetic stability on the native quaternary structure of TTR, precluding rate-limiting tetramer dissociation and, hence, amyloidogenesis from commencing.4,13,15,19,20 Because genetic studies have uncovered a mechanistically analogous strategy that prevents human disease,

there is good reason to be optimistic that small molecule TTR kinetic stabilizers will be efficacious against TTR amyloid disease. This strategy, called interallelic trans-suppression, is observed in compound heterozygotes having one allele coding for the disease-associated V30M-TTR variant (associated with high FAP penetrance) and the other allele coding for T119MTTR. Inclusion of T119M subunits into heterotetramers otherwise composed of V30M subunits kinetically stabilizes TTR, preventing tetramer dissociation, amyloidogenesis, and the onset of FAP symptoms.4,19,21­23 Besides demonstrating the efficacy of kinetic stabilization for ameliorating transthyretin amyloid disease, this data provides strong evidence for the amyloid hypothesis as the basis for pathology, that is, the notion that TTR dissociation, misfolding, and misassembly cause the TTR amyloidoses.23 The efficacy of candidate small molecule transthyretin amyloidogenesis inhibitors is typically evaluated by using a simple turbidity assay (turbidity increases with protein aggregation). Screening and structure-based drug design have enabled the evaluation of more than 650 candidate TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors.4,18,20,24­36 Of these, 1/3 are potent inhibitors of acidmediated aggregation of TTR in vitro (described in more detail below), that is, they allow <10% of the aggregation (>90% inhibition) exhibited by inhibitor-free control samples over a 72 h time course. Potent inhibition of TTR amyloidogenesis in vitro is necessary, but not sufficient, for efficacy in humans: the small molecule TTR kinetic stabilizers must also bind selectively to TTR over all of the other proteins in blood.37 Of the 200 compounds exhibiting >90% inhibition of TTR amyloidogenesis in vitro, only 1/4 of these display high binding selectivity in plasma (>1.0 out of a maximum of 2 equiv of inhibitor bound per tetramer).37 To develop an effective clinical candidate, it would be advantageous to have a number of structurally diverse, potent, and highly selective TTR kinetic stabilizers. The majority of the potent and selective TTR kinetic stabilizers are found in three structural families: bisaryloxime ethers, biphenyls, and 1-aryl-4,6-biscarboxydibenzofurans (20, 30, and 40%, respectively); the remaining 10% are based on 2-phenylbenzoxazole or biphenylamine substructures.18,25,27,31­33,36 Unfortunately, many of the most potent and selective bisaryloxime ethers have lower than desirable chemical stability,25 leaving the biphenyls and dibenzofuran inhibitors as primary candidates. The lack of selective, structurally diverse clinical candidates is in large part due to the fact that there has been no systematic optimization of the three structural elements composing a typical small molecule TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitor, that is, the two variably substituted aromatic rings and the linker joining them (Figure 2). Consequently, we have developed three small

Percent (%) values represent the extent of in vitro WT-TTR fibril formation in the presence of inhibitor (7.2 µM inhibitor, 3.6 µM TTR, pH 4.4, 37 °C, 72 h) relative to aggregation in the absence of inhibitor (100%), with the best values shown in red (<20% aggregation; errors are typically less than (5 percentage points).

molecule libraries to systematically optimize these substructures to create potent and especially highly selective TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors. The structure­activity relationship (SAR) data from these libraries will ultimately be utilized to predict the structures of diverse, potent, and highly selective TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors, which should increase the chances of developing a successful clinical candidate. The synthesis and evaluation of the first library, designed to optimize the aryl-X ring (Figure 2), is presented herein. In this exercise, the 2-aryl ring of an otherwise unsubstituted 2-arylbenzoxazole scaffold is modified with various substituents to evaluate the influence of thyroid hormone-like aryl substructures (3,4,5-substituted aryls, Figure 3) on transthyretin amyloidogenesis and selective binding to TTR in blood plasma. Because amelioration of transthyretin amyloidosis (SSA, FAP, and FAC) is envisioned to require life-long therapy with TTR small molecule kinetic stabilizers, it is essential that these drugs minimally interfere with other biological processes to mitigate toxicity. Therefore, we have further evaluated the potent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors identified here for their ability to bind to the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor, as well as inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) activity. Effective clinical candidates should be neither thyroid hormone agonists/antagonists, nor should they inhibit COX-1 enzymatic activity because FAP/ FAC patients typically have amyloid deposition in the kidneys and gastro-intestinal tract, which compromises function and can be exacerbated by COX-1 inhibition.38 Herein, we report potent and highly selective TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors bearing thyroid hormone-like substitution patterns on the aryl-X ring that, in general, do not bind to the COX-1 enzyme or the thyroid hormone receptor. Further evaluation by X-ray crystallography provides interesting insight into the structural basis for the ability of several of these potent inhibitors to bind to TTR. Design and Synthesis. Previous studies reveal that 2,4,6triiodophenol is a potent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitor, which

is impressive considering that potent inhibition generally requires two differentially substituted aryls connected by a linker.4,18,20,24­36 It is also known that incorporation of the 3,5-dihalo-4hydroxyphenyl substructure into bisaryloxime ether and biphenyl-based inhibitors (Figure 1, bottom) yields potent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors that exhibit selective binding to plasma TTR, almost irrespective of the substituents on the other aryl ring.25,32 Collectively, these data suggest that it is likely that appending a 3,5-dihalo-4-hydroxyphenyl aryl ring, or a mimetic thereof, to a variety of molecules could render them potent and selective TTR kinetic stabilizers; hence, we focused on similar substituents and substitution patterns (Figure 3). Aryl rings substituted in this fashion were envisioned to interact within the inner cavity of the T4 binding site (much like the analogous aryl ring in thyroxine, Figure 1). Optimization of the composition of the aryl-X ring will enable these aryl-X substructures to be utilized in future studies that seek ideal aryl-Z ring and linker-Y substructures (Figure 2). Data generated in this study can be combined with future analogous data on optimal aryl-Z and like substructures to predict the structures of exceptionally potent and selective TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors. In 2003, we demonstrated that 2-arylbenzoxazole-based compounds are potent TTR kinetic stabilizers in vitro that display the full range of binding selectivity in human plasma, affording stoichiometries from near zero to the theoretical maximum of two, depending on the substituents and substitution patterns on the 2-phenyl and benzoxazole substructures.33 Therefore, substituting a variety of aryls at the 2-position of an otherwise unsubstituted benzoxazole scaffold should enable optimization of the aryl-X ring, as discussed above. A 42member library of 2-arylbenzoxazole compounds, with variation in the 2-aryl ring, was synthesized as described previously (Scheme 1, Figure 3).33,39 Compounds were characterized by

The ability of candidate 2-arylbenzoxazoles to inhibit WT-TTR amyloidogenesis was evaluated using the established acid-mediated aggregation assay.40 Briefly, physiologically relevant concentrations of WT-TTR (3.6 µM) preincubated with a candidate inhibitor (7.2 µM) were subjected to partial denaturation under conditions that enable 90% of WT-TTR to aggregate in the absence of inhibitor after 72 h (pH 4.4, 37 °C). The extent of aggregation is monitored by measuring sample turbidity, which has previously been demonstrated to be equivalent to monitoring amyloidogenesis by thioflavin-T fluorescence.41 Inhibitor potency is expressed as % aggregation at the 72 h time point (compared to aggregation in the absence of inhibitor) with 0% aggregation equating to 100% inhibition. For the purposes here, we have defined a potent inhibitor as allowing <20% TTR aggregation; 13 compounds proved to be potent inhibitors of WT-TTR aggregation by this definition (Figure 3, red data). Although the series 1, 5, and 6 compounds are poor kinetic stabilizers of TTR, several compounds in the 2-4 series proved to be potent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors. Binding Selectivity of Amyloidogenesis Inhibitors to TTR in Human Blood Plasma. The 13 potent 2-arylbenzoxazole aggregation inhibitors were further evaluated for their ability to bind selectively to TTR in the blood using the published ex vivo TTR plasma binding selectivity assay.37 Briefly, the candidate 2-arylbenzoxazole (10.8 µM) is incubated in human blood plasma in the dark at 37 °C for 24 h. Transthyretin, with any bound inhibitor, is then captured by a resin-conjugated anti-TTR antibody and any unbound material is washed away (including weakly or nonspecifically bound inhibitors). The captured TTR · (inhibitor)n complex is then dissociated from the antibody under alkaline conditions and quantified by RP-HPLC. The results represent the average stoichiometry of inhibitor bound per TTR tetramer (Figure 3, lower italicized values), the theoretical maximum being 2, owing to the two thyroxine binding sites. Of the 13 potent aggregation inhibitors evaluated, four display binding stoichiometries in

The 13 potent TTR aggregation inhibitors were further evaluated for their ability to inhibit the COX-1 enzyme (analyses that were contracted out to the Cerep laboratories in Redmond, WA). Compound analyses were performed using assay catalog reference #777-1 hr, which uses procedures developed by Glaser et al.42 Briefly, the COX-1 enzyme (2 µg in 250 µL of buffer) is preincubated in the absence or presence of test compound (10.0 µM) for 20 min at 22 °C. Arachidonic acid (4 µM) is then added, which undergoes catalytic conversion by COX-1 to afford prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2). After 10 min, the reaction is quenched by addition of 2 M HCl followed by 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and cooling to 4 °C. PGE2 is then quantified using an EIA detection kit. Results represent the % inhibition of arachidonic acid conversion to PGE2 due to competitive binding of test compound to COX-1 (Figure 4, lower, black values). Of the 13 compounds evaluated, all but three display <5% inhibition of COX-1 activity, which is important to mitigate toxicity in the FAP/FAC patients for which inhibition of COX-1 enzymatic activity (anti-inflammatory agents) is contraindicated. Compounds 2d, 2f, and 4e display 11­18% COX-1 inhibition. Binding of TTR Amyloidogenesis Inhibitors to the Thyroid Hormone Nuclear Receptor. Because the compounds under investigation bear thyroid hormone-like 2-aryl substructures, the potent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors were further evaluated for their ability to interact with the thyroid hormone receptor (analyses that were contracted out to the Cerep laboratories in Redmond, WA). Compound analyses were performed using assay catalog reference #855, which uses procedures developed by Inoue et al.43 Briefly, liver membrane homogenates (100 µg protein in 500 µL of buffer) were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with 0.1 nM 125I-labeled triiodothyronine ([125I]T3, the primary thyroid hormone, with a binding IC50 ) 0.38 nM) in the absence or presence of test compound (10.0 µM). The samples were vacuum filtered through glass fiber filters, which were then rinsed several times with ice-cold buffer, dried, and counted for radioactivity. Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 1 µM T3, is subtracted from the [125I]T3 binding results. Results represent the % displacement of [125I]T3 due to competitive binding of test compound to the thyroid hormone receptor (Figure 4, red, italicized values). Of the 13 compounds evaluated, all but one display insignificant (<5%) inhibition of T3 binding to the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor, important for avoiding toxicity in the intended longterm use. Compound 4e displays 17% inhibition of T3 binding, a compound also displaying COX-1 binding capacity. X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of WT-TTR Bound to Inhibitors 2f, 4d, and 4f. Crystal structures of apo-WT-TTR and TTR in complex with compounds 2f, 4d, and 4f were determined to 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, and 1.3 Å resolutions, respectively. While the observed electron density for inhibitor 2f was weaker, the electron density for the other two inhibitor-containing structures was clear and allowed unambiguous placement of the ligands. Inhibitors 2f and 4f bind in what is referred to as the "forward" mode, with their 3,5-dimethylphenyl and 3,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl substructures, respectively, occupying the inner cavity of the thyroxine binding site (Figure 5). As such, their methyl substituents extend into the two halogen binding pockets located in the inner binding cavity (HBP-3 and 3). In the 4f structure, the Ser-117 and 117 side chains of adjacent TTR subunits are bridged through hydrogen bonding with the

4-OH substituent of inhibitor 4f. In the 2f structure, an ordered water molecule replaces the missing phenolic group. In contrast to the forward binding mode exhibited by inhibitors 2f and 4f, inhibitor 4d binds in the "reverse" binding mode, whereby its bromines extend into the outer cavity HBPs-1 and 1 (Figure 5) and the phenolic substituent interacts with the Lys-15 and 15 -NH3+ groups. In all three structures, the 2-aryl ring is bound rigidly in either the inner or outer cavities (2f/4f and 4d, respectively), while occupancy by the benzoxazole rings show greater variability. Although ordered water molecules are present within each structure, these do not make any significant interactions with any of the bound inhibitors. Discussion Aryl Substructures Leading to Potent WT-TTR Aggregation Inhibitors. The specific interactions made by the rigidly positioned substituted 2-aryl rings (aryl-X) in the 2d, 4d, and 4f amyloidogenesis inhibitor/TTR cocrystal structures likely contribute the most to the binding affinity and specificity, while the unsubstituted benzoxazole aromatic appears to contribute less. Although the potentially unpredictable binding orientations of the 2-arylbenzoxazoles complicate a detailed structure­activity relationship (SAR) interpretation, several trends are evident even in the absence of structural data for each ligand (Figure 3). Two dominant ligand-protein interactions contribute to inhibitor potency: the hydrophobic/electrostatic interactions of the 3,5-X2 substituents and the electrostatic interactions of the 4-OH group. The most potent inhibitors, containing the thyroxinelike 3,5-X2-4-OH 2-aryl substitution pattern (series 4, Figure 3), enable both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. The hydrophobicity of the 3,5-substituents is known to play a role in the binding affinity of ligands to transthyretin; increased hydrophobicity generally leads to increased binding affinity and, therefore, increased inhibitor potency.44 Consistent with this interpretation, hydrogen and fluorine substituents tend to afford poorer aggregation inhibitors than their chloro, bromo, iodo, and methyl counterparts due to less-efficient interactions with the HBPs. Halogens are known to contribute more to ligand binding affinity than would be expected based on their hydrophobicity alone.44,45 Formation of a charge-transfer complex between the halogen and a neighboring oxygen atom could be the basis for enhanced inhibitor binding.44,45 Bis-meta-substitution appears superior to mono-meta-substitution, as exemplified by the increased potency of several of the series 2 (3,5-X2) compounds over the series 1 compounds (3-X only). This effect

may be a result of the 3,5-X2 substituents being able to efficiently interact with two HBPs on adjacent TTR subunits simultaneously, whereas mono-meta-substitution enables occupancy of only one HBP and is, therefore, less efficient at stabilizing the weaker dimer­dimer interface. The contribution of the 4-OH group (series 3 and 4) to high binding affinity is emphasized by the increased potencies of the series 3 and 4 compounds over the series 1 and 2 compounds. The phenolic group can make hydrogen bonding interactions that bridge the Ser-117 and 117 hydroxyls (Figure 5), as demonstrated in the 4f cocrystal structure. The H-bonding enabled by 4f leads to higher affinity relative to 2f, which lacks a phenolic substituent, and is consistent with the weaker electron density for 2f that results in higher B-values (Table 1). Interestingly, the isostructural compound 4d binds in an orientation opposite to that of 4f. In the TTR · (4d)2 structure, the phenolic group can now engage in electrostatic interactions with the Lys-15 and 15 -NH3+ groups. We posit that the binding orientation differences of 4d and 4f are caused by the different inductive effects of the bromine and methyl substituents. With 4f, the electron-donating methyls result in a higher pKa for the phenolic group, such that it is protonated (pKa calcd to be 9.21; refer to Figure S2 in the Supporting Information),46 favoring hydrogen bonding with the Ser-117 and 117 hydroxyls. In contrast, the electron-withdrawing bromines of 4d appear to afford the phenoxide ion (pKa calcd tothe importance of phenol ionization. Interestingly, O-methylation of 4f to give analogue 6f does not cause such a dramatic decrease in activity, reflecting the fact that our preliminary explanation may be oversimplistic. Aryl Substructures Conferring Selective Binding to TTR in Human Blood. 2-Arylbenzoxazoles that have the highest affinity for recombinant TTR in buffer are not necessarily the most selective TTR binders in the blood because binding to other prominent plasma proteins, such as albumin, is possible. An ideal clinical candidate should bind selectively to TTR in the blood to mitigate off-pathway toxicity. Therefore, the TTR binding selectivities of the 13 potent 2-arylbenzoxazole inhibitors displaying <20% fibril formation were evaluated using the previously established TTR binding selectivity assay. Since only the binding stoichiometry of the inhibitor to TTR is evaluated in this assay, we cannot comment on selectivity as it relates to inhibitor binding to other specific plasma proteins, which limits a detailed interpretation of the primary factors governing TTR binding selectivity.

The 3,5-X2-4-hydroxyphenyl substitution pattern (X ) Cl, Br, I, and CH3) in the series 4 inhibitors enables highly selective binding to TTR, with the exception of 4b. These exemplary binding stoichiometries emphasize the synergistic interactions between the 3,5-X2 and the 4-OH substituents, which enhance inhibitor binding affinity for reasons discussed above. That inhibitor binding affinity and selectivity can be further enhanced by adding substituents on the benzoxazole is encouraging for future lead development.33 Thyroid Hormone-Like 2-Arylbenzoxazoles Minimally Interact with the COX-1 Enzyme and the Thyroid Hormone Nuclear Receptor. To mitigate off-target toxicity, TTR small molecule kinetic stabilizers should not bind to COX-1 or the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. Because many of these compounds resemble nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are contraindicated for treating FAP patients, we evaluated their COX-1 activity. The majority of the amyloidogenesis inhibitors display little, if any, inhibition of COX-1 activity (Figure 4, lower black entries).42 The exceptions are compounds 2d, 2f, and 4e, which display some

COX-1 activity. The lack of COX-1 enzymatic inhibition by the majority of these compounds may be due to the absence of a carboxylate substituent, which is generally thought to be important for high affinity binding to the enzyme.47­50 Because the most potent 2-arylbenzoxazole TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors have the 3-X-4-OH and 3,5-X2-4-OH aryl substructures, as found in tri-iodothyronine (T3, the primary thyroid hormone) and thyroxine (the prohormone), respectively, these were evaluated for their ability to interact with the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. The T3 competition binding assay indicates that, with the exception of 4e (bearing the exact 3,5I2-4-hydroxyphenyl substitution pattern of thyroxine), the majority of the most potent TTR amyloidogenesis inhibitors do not interact significantly with the thyroid hormone receptor (Figure 4, red, italicized values).43 The minimal thyroid hormone receptor binding is likely due to the lack of the carboxylic acid side chain that is present in T3, which is important for polar interactions within the thyroid hormone receptor.52­55 Additionally, the 3,5-X2 aryl substitution pattern presumably decreases ligand binding affinity due to steric interaction of the 5-sub-

stituent with residues in the thyroid hormone receptor binding site, as T3 has a hydrogen in this position (Figure 1).51­55 Structural Insights for Development of Optimized TTR Amyloidogenesis Inhibitors. Although the thyroid hormonelike 2-aryl rings were envisioned to interact solely within the smaller inner cavity of the thyroxine binding sites, X-ray analysis demonstrates that this is not necessarily the case (Figure 5). Binding in either orientation permits energetically favorable interactions that noncovalently bridge and stabilize the adjacent TTR subunits across the weaker of the two dimer­dimer interfaces. Even though compounds 4d and 4f are both highly active and selective compounds, they exhibit strikingly different interactions throughout the outer and inner cavities of the T4 binding site, respectively. When the TTR · (4d)2 and TTR · (4f)2 cocrystal structures are overlaid, the substituted phenyl substructures of each are reminiscent of the recently reported TTR · (PCB-OH)2 cocrystal structure (Figure 6) in which the protein backbones, side chains, and the 3,5-X2-4-hydroxyphenyl rings of the three structures superimpose nearly identically.32 To our knowledge, PCB-OH is the most potent inhibitor discovered to date; it binds with the highest affinity (and relatively high selectivity) to TTR and is the only compound that displays positive binding cooperativity.4,19,32,56,57 Because the 2-aryl rings of inhibitors 4d and 4f (i.e., the substituted phenyl rings) preferentially adopt conformations analogous to that observed in TTR · (PCB-OH)2, these structures (TTR · (4d/ 4f)2) should be valuable as templates to design inhibitors with optimal interactions in both the inner and outer cavities of the thyroxine binding sites. Concluding Remarks. From this initial study that was designed to optimize the aryl-X substituents for transthyretin amyloidogenesis inhibitor potency and binding selectivity, we evaluated a library of 2-arylbenzoxazoles, of which 13

compounds potently inhibit TTR aggregation in vitro. Notably, four of these bind with high selectivity to transthyretin in blood plasma ex vivo. The most potent and selective inhibitors display little, if any, thyroid hormone nuclear receptor or COX-1 binding, which is highly desirable for transthyretin amyloidosis patients. The 3,4,5-substituted thyroxine-like aryl ring, but not necessarily the 3,5-I2-4hydroxyphenyl thyroxine aryl ring itself, appears to be an optimal solution for aryl-X ring composition for future studies, where subsequent libraries will be used to optimize the second ring (aryl-Z) and the linker for potency and binding selectivity. While X-ray crystallographic analysis demonstrates that incorporation of the 3,4,5-substituted aryl ring system into the 2-position of benzoxazoles does not necessarily guarantee a predictable binding orientation, we are optimistic that further studies for optimization of the linker and aryl-Z ring will provide more insight for predicting inhibitor binding orientations that can be verified by crystallographic analysis. Experimental Section
General Synthetic Methods. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60, F254-coated glass plates (EM Sciences). Flash chromatography was performed using 230­400 mesh silica gel 60 (EM Sciences). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million downfield from the internal standard Me4Si (0.0 ppm) for CDCl3 solutions, and d6-DMSO solutions were calibrated to the solvent peaks at 2.49 and 39.52 ppm for the 1H and 13C NMR spectra, respectively. Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) was performed using a Waters 600 E multisolvent delivery system employing a Waters 486 tunable

Refer to the Supporting Information for specific synthetic details and characterization data for inhibitors prepared analogously. Evaluating Small Molecule-Mediated Inhibition of WTTTR Amyloidogenesis. WT-TTR was purified from an E. coli expression system, as described previously.58 To a 495 µL aliquot of 0.4 mg/mL WT-TTR (7.2µM, 10 mM phosphate, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA) in a disposable cuvette was added 5 µL of a 1.44 mM DMSO solution of test compound and the sample was vortexed briefly. After incubating for 30 min at ambient temperature, the pH of the sample was lowered to 4.4 by the addition of 500 µL of acidic buffer (100 mM acetate, pH 4.2, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA), and the solution was briefly vortexed and incubated in the dark for 72 h at 37 °C (final protein and inhibitor concentrations were 3.6 and 7.2 µM, respectively). The sample was then vortexed to evenly distribute any precipitate, and the turbidity was measured at 400 nm on a Hewlett-Packard model 8453 UV­vis spectrophotometer. The extent of WT-TTR aggregation (% fibril formation, f.f.; % inhibition ) 100 - %f.f.) was determined by comparing the sample turbidity in the presence of small molecule as a percentage of control WT-TTR sample incubated with 5 µL of pure DMSO (representing 100% aggregation, 0% inhibition). All samples were performed in at least triplicate, with average values obtained presented in Figure 3 (errors are typically less than ( 5 percentage points). Evaluating the Binding Selectivity of Amyloidogenesis Inhibitors to TTR in Human Blood Plasma. The procedure for the antibody capture method to evaluate the stoichiometry of inhibitor bound to TTR in human blood plasma has been described in detail elsewhere.37 Briefly, 7.50 µL of a 1.44 mM DMSO solution of test compound was incubated with human blood plasma (1 mL) in a 2 mL eppendorf tube in the dark at 37 °C for 24 h on a rocker (30 rpm). Then, 125 µL of a 1:1 v/v slurry of unfunctionalized sepharose resin in TSA (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl) was added, and the mixture was incubated for another hour at 4 °C on a rocker (18 rpm). The sample was then centrifuged, the supernatant was divided into 2 aliquots of 400 µL each, which were each added to 200 µL of a 1:1 v/v slurry of sepharose resin conjugated to an anti-TTR antibody in TSA, and the sample was incubated again at 4 °C for 20 min on a rocker (18 rpm). The sample was then centrifuged, the supernatant removed, and the TTR bound resin was washed three times (10 min each wash) with 1 mL of TSA/ 0.05% saponin, then twice (10 min each wash) with 1 mL TSA at 4 °C on a rocker (18 rpm). After centrifugation and removal of the

final supernatant, dissociation of the TTR and bound test compound from the resin-bound antibody was achieved through addition of 155 µL of aqueous triethylamine (100 mM, pH  11.5) and rocking (18 rpm) at 4 °C for 30 min. The suspension was then centrifuged, and 135 µL of the supernatant, containing both TTR and test compound, was analyzed by RP-HPLC to determine the stoichiometry of small molecule bound to TTR (the test compound-TTR complex dissociates and the small molecule and protein are chromatographically separable under the HPLC buffer conditions). Quantification of test compound and TTR is achieved by comparing the integrated peak areas to standard curves: the ratio of the amount of test compound to TTR yields the binding stoichiometry, of which a theoretical maximum value of 2 is possible due to the two T4 binding sites per TTR tetramer. Analyses were performed in at least triplicates of duplicates from three different blood plasma samples (i.e., at least six analyses), with average values obtained presented in Figure 3 (errors are typically less than (0.1). Evaluating the Inhibition of COX-1 Enzymatic Activity by the Potent TTR Amyloidosis Inhibitors. The evaluation of the most potent TTR aggregation inhibitors (displaying <20% fibril formation) at inhibiting COX-1 activity was contracted out to the Cerep laboratories in Redmond, WA. Compound analyses were performed using assay catalog reference #777-1 hr, which uses procedures developed by Glaser et al.42 A brief experimental protocol as provided by Cerep is outlined below. In this assay, the enzyme (2 µg) is preincubated in the absence (water control) or presence of test compound (10.0 µM) for 20 min at 22 °C in 250 µL of buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mM phenol, 1 µM hematine). Arachidonic acid (4 µM) is then added to initiate the reaction (no arachidonic acid added for basal control measurements). After incubation at 22 °C for 10 min, the reaction is quenched by addition of 2 M HCl and 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and cooling at 4 °C. Prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) quantification is performed using an EIA detection kit, with measurements made using a microplate reader. Average values of duplicate analyses are presented in Figure 4 (black values), which represent the % inhibition of arachidonic acid conversion to PGE2 due to competitive binding of test compound to COX-1 (errors of less than ( 6 percentage points are representative of the data). Control analyses are performed analogously with the standard inhibitory reference compound diclofenac tested at several concentrations to obtain an inhibition curve from which its IC50 is calculated (12 nM). Evaluating the Binding of the Potent TTR Amyloidosis Inhibitors to the Thyroid Hormone Nuclear Receptor. The evaluation of the most potent TTR aggregation inhibitors (displaying <20% fibril formation) at binding to the thyroid hormone receptor was contracted out to the Cerep laboratories in Redmond, WA. Compound analyses were performed using assay catalog reference #855, which uses procedures developed by Inoue et al.43 A brief experimental protocol as provided by Cerep is outlined below. In this assay, liver membrane homogenates (100 µg protein) are incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with 0.1 nM 125I-labeled triiodothyronine ([125I]T3, the primary thyroid hormone) in the absence or presence of test compound (10.0 µM) in 500 µL of buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM -mercaptoethanol). The samples are then vacuum filtered through glass fiber filters (GF/B, Packard), rinsed several times with ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl), and the filters are dried and counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter (Topcount, Packard) using a scintillation cocktail (Microscint 0, Packard). Nonspecific binding, determined in the presence of 1 µM T3, is subtracted from the [125I]T3 binding results. Average values of duplicate analyses are presented in Figure 4 (red italicized values), which represent the % displacement of [125I]T3 due to competitive binding of test compound to the thyroid hormone receptor (errors of less than ( 2 percentage points are representative of the data). Control analyses are performed analogously with T3 tested at several concentrations to obtain a competition curve from which its IC50 is calculated (0.38 nM).

X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of WT-TTR in apo-Form and Bound to Inhibitors 2f, 4d, and 4f. WT-TTR was purified from an E. coli expression system, as described previously.58 The WT-TTR was concentrated to 4 mg/mL in 10 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl, at pH 7.6 and cocrystallized at room temperature with inhibitors 2d, 4d, and 4f at a 5 M excess using the vapor-diffusion sitting drop method. Crystals were grown from 1.395 M sodium citrate, 3.5% v/v glycerol at pH 5.5. The crystals were cryoprotected with an inhibitor-free solution of 10% v/v glycerol. Data were collected at beam line 11-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) at a wavelength of 0.9795 Å for the apo, 2f, and 4f crystals and at 0.9195 Å, corresponding to the bromine peak wavelength, for the 4d crystals. The data sets were integrated and scaled using HKL2000.59 The crystals were indexed in space group P21212 with two subunits per asymmetric unit with unit cell dimensions a ) 84.9 Å, b ) 43.9 Å, and c ) 64.8 Å. The four crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement using the model coordinates of 2FBR60 in the program Phaser61 to 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, and 1.3 Å resolutions for the apo, 2f, 4d, and 4f structures, respectively. Further model building and refinement were completed using Refmac.62 Hydrogens were added during refinement and anisotropic B-values were calculated. Final models were validated using the JCSG quality control server incorporating Molprobity,63 ADIT (http://rcsb-deposit.rutgers.edu/validate) WHATIF,64 Resolve,65 and Procheck.66 Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Protein Data Bank Accession Codes. Atomic coordinates have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (www.pdb.org) and are available under accession codes 2QGB (apo-form WT-TTR), 2QGE (WT-TTR in complex with 2f), 2QGD (WT-TTR in complex with 4d), and 2QGC (WT-TTR in complex with 4f).
