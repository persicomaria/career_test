Structures of recombinant native and E202Q mutant human acetylcholinesterase complexed with the snake-venom toxin fasciculin-II
Structures of recombinant wild-type human acetylcholinesterase and of its E202Q mutant as complexes with fasciculin-II, a `three-®nger' polypeptide toxin puri®ed from the venom of the eastern green mamba (Dendroaspis angusticeps), are reported. The structure of the complex of Ê the wild-type enzyme was solved to 2.8 A resolution by molecular replacement starting from the structure of the complex of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase with fasciculin-II and veri®ed by starting from a similar complex with mouse acetylcholinesterase. The overall structure is surprisingly similar to that of the T. californica enzyme with fasciculin-II and, as expected, to that of the mouse acetylcholinesterase complex. The structure of the E202Q mutant complex was re®ned starting from the corresponding wild-type human acetylcholinesterase structure, using the Ê 2.7 A resolution data set collected. Comparison of the two structures shows that removal of the charged group from the protein core and its substitution by a neutral isosteric moiety does not disrupt the functional architecture of the active centre. One of the elements of this architecture is thought to be a hydrogen-bond network including residues Glu202, Glu450, Tyr133 and two bridging molecules of water, which is conserved in other vertebrate acetylcholinesterases as well as in the human enzyme. The present ®ndings are consistent with the notion that the main role of this network is the proper positioning of the Glu202 carboxylate relative to the catalytic triad, thus de®ning its functional role in the interaction of acetylcholinesterase with substrates and inhibitors.

1. Introduction
Acetylcholinesterase (AChE; E.C. 3.1.1.7) is among the most ef®cient enzymes, with a turnover number of >104 sÀ1. While the structural and mechanistic origin of its catalytic power and high reactivity toward organophosphorus inhibitors has been a subject of interest for several decades, only recently has it been possible to delineate the unique functional architecture of the AChE active centre. This has been performed primarily by X-ray crystallography (Bourne et al., 1995, 1999; Harel et al., 1995, 1996; Sussman et al., 1991) together with kinetic studies utilizing wild-type and mutant enzymes (Ordentlich et al., 1996; Radic et al., 1992; Shafferman, Kronman et al., 1992). Knowledge of the structural and functional properties of AChE, in particular those of human AChE (hAChE), is important for the design of anti-Alzheimer drugs (Enz et al., 1993; Weinstock, 1995), for development of improved procedures for treatment of intoxication by nerve agents (Millard & Broom®eld, 1995; Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Kronman et

al., 1996) and for the design of safer and more effective insecticides by comparison with the three-dimensional structure of the insect enzyme (Harel et al., 2000). The X-ray structures of AChEs are characterized by a deep and narrow gorge which penetrates halfway into the enzyme, Ê with the catalytic site about 4 A from its base (Silman & Sussman, 2000). In addition to the catalytic triad residue Glu334(327),1 two other acidic amino acids are located near the bottom of the gorge: Glu202(199), located next to the Ê catalytic Ser203(200), and Glu450(443), $9 A away. These two residues are a part of the hydrogen-bond network in the AChE active centre (Ordentlich et al., 1993), which also includes Tyr133(130) and two bridging water molecules [waters 681 and 615 in T. californica AChE (TcAChE); PDB code 2ace; Koellner et al., 2000]. This network may aid in maintaining the functional architecture of the catalytic machinery by ensuring correct positioning of Glu202(199) with respect to the catalytic triad. It is commonly thought that removal of a charged residue from the core of a protein will result in a local structural perturbation (Hendsch et al., 1996). However, the effects of the replacement of Glu202(199) by glutamine upon AChE catalysis (Malany et al., 2000; Radic et al., 1992; Shafferman, Velan et al., 1992), phosphylation (Hosea et al., 1996; Ordentlich et al., 1996, 1999), carbamylation (Ariel et al., 1998; Radic et al., 1992) and aging (Masson et al., 1997; Ordentlich et al., 1993, 1999; Saxena et al., 1993, 1998; Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Stein et al., 1996) could be better explained by removal of the carboxylate from the vicinity of the His447(440) imidazole than by more substantial reorganization at the active centre. To further examine this issue, we compared the X-ray structure of the wild-type hAChE with that of the E202Q mutant. Vertebrate AChEs occur in several different molecular Â forms which differ in their number of subunits (Massoulie et al., 1993). Recombinant hAChE is secreted into the culture medium as a mixture of monomers, dimers and tetramers (Velan et al., 1991). Additional heterogeneity may arise from variations in the extent of glycosylation (Velan et al., 1993) and owing to proteolytic `nicking'. Such heterogeneity may severely impede crystallization. To partially alleviate this problem, mutants of the wild-type and the E202Q hAChEs were constructed in which the C terminus had been truncated so as to allow expression only of a monomeric form, as had already been performed to assist crystallization of recombinant mouse AChE (mAChE; Marchot et al., 1996). Crystallization of the truncated hAChEs was further aided by complexation with fasciculin-II (FAS-II; Karlsson et al., 1984), a 61 amino-acid polypeptide secreted in the venom of the eastern green mamba (D. angusticeps) which is a member of the `three-®nger' toxin family (Harvey, 1991). FAS-II binds tightly to AChE of higher vertebrates (Radic et al., 1994) and had already been found to facilitate crystallization of both TcAChE and mAChE. In both these structures, fasciculin interacts predominantly with the peripheral anionic site

without affecting the structure of the active centre (Bourne et al., 1995; Giles et al., 1997; Harel et al., 1995).

2. Experimental
2.1. Mutagenesis, generation and purification of truncated recombinant hAChE

Truncation of the C terminus of the T subunit of hAChE (Soreq et al., 1990) was performed by DNA cassette replacement (Shafferman, Kronman et al., 1992). Speci®cally, the 187 bp DNA fragment between BssHII and SalI in pL5CA (Kronman et al., 1992) was replaced by the synthetic DNA duplex. The truncated DNA sequence was introduced into a tripartite expression vector also expressing the reporter gene cat and the selection marker neo. The expression vector coding for expression of monomeric hAChE was introduced into HEK 293 cells. Stable clones, secreting high levels (>4 U mlÀ1 hÀ1) of truncated enzyme (ÁCter-hAChE), were isolated and used in large-scale production (Kronman et al., 1992), thus yielding amounts of puri®ed enzyme adequate for crystallization. A homologous truncated DNA sequence, in which site-directed mutagenesis afforded expression of the E202Q mutant (Shafferman, Velan et al., 1992), was generated in order to study the importance of the negative charge next to the catalytic Ser203 in the active site. This mutant was

expressed and characterized similarly. Puri®cation of both WT and E202Q hAChE was carried out by af®nity chromatography as described previously (Sussman et al., 1988). Catalytic activity was assayed spectrophotometrically using acetylthiocholine (ATC) as a substrate by the Ellman method (Ellman et al., 1961). Analytical sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed on 5±20% sucrose gradients, as described previously (Velan et al., 1991).

FAS-II was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Both WT hAChE and the E202Q mutant were cocrystallized as a stoichiometric complex with FAS-II. The pure and concentrated enzyme solution was combined with an aqueous solution of the toxin. In detail: 40 ml of hAChE (13±15 mg mlÀ1) in 1 mM HEPES/10 mM NaCl/0.02% NaN3 pH 7.0 were combined with 30 ml of FAS-II (2.3 mg mlÀ1) in the same buffer to yield the protein stock solution. Ammonium sulfate at 1.4±1.8 M was adjusted to pH 7.5 with ammonium hydroxide and buffered with HEPES to pH 7.0±7.6 to form the well solution. The protein stock and the well solution were combined in 1:2, 1:1 and 2:1 ratios in 8 ml hanging drops. Crystals appeared within 1±2 d and grew over a period of three weeks (Fig. 1). These experiments yielded a shower of small (up to 100 mm) prism-shaped crystals with almost no optical activity, weak diffraction and high sensitivity to rotating-anode X-ray source radiation at 277 K. Nevertheless, rotating-anode data from these crystals were adequate for determining the unit-cell parameters (a = 149, b = 149, Ê c = 247 A,  = 90,  = 90,  = 120 ), lattice type (rhombohedral) and space group (R32). A recrystallization procedure was then applied to drops which had either given a shower of small crystals or had yielded a precipitate. This was performed by placing the drops over water overnight or until the precipitate and/or small crystals had dissolved and the drop had become clear; they were then placed over either the original reservoir or over a reservoir of lower precipitant concentra-

tion for recrystallization. This procedure usually produced fewer but larger crystals up to 800 mm in their longest dimension. These crystals were subsequently used for cryogenic data collection [using 20%(w/v) sucrose as a cryoprotectant] on a bending-magnet synchrotron X-ray source (X12-B/C at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory). Under the conditions employed, Ê the crystals diffracted to 2.7 A. The data collected at the synchrotron con®rmed the unit-cell parameters and spacegroup assignment and were used for structure determination (see Table 1).

The structures of the TcAChE±FAS-II complex (Harel et al., 1995; PDB code 1fss) and the mAChE±FAS-II complex (Bourne et al., 1995; PDB code 1mah) were employed in parallel as probe models for the molecular-replacement procedure using the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and

subsequently as starting models for re®nement. The aminoacid sequences of TcAChE, mAChE and hAChE are very similar (Fig. 2); thus, the human structure could be assumed to be similar enough to both the T. californica and the mouse structures for either to be used in molecular replacement. The ®rst and second solutions using each probe were related by one of the crystallographic symmetry operations of space group R32. The next best solution for each probe had a signi®cantly poorer ®t (see Table 2). Both models were re®ned separately using annealing and omit-map techniques. When re®nement starting from either TcAChE or mAChE converged to practically identical models, further re®nement was pursued only from the model derived from the TcAChE structure. Diffraction data for the E202Q mutant were re®ned similarly, but using the hAChE±FAS-II structure as the starting model. The structures were re®ned using X-PLOR,

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of DCter-hAChE

The T subunit expressed was devoid of the C-terminal hydrophobic sequence corresponding to residues 544±583, including C580, which forms the interchain disul®de in oligomeric forms (Giles, 1997; Velan et al., 1991). These residues were replaced by the pentapeptide ASEAP, which is part of the mature natural C-terminal sequence in the H subunit Â (Massoulie et al., 1993). As expected, the resulting truncated enzyme displays the following structural and catalytic characteristics. (i) Sucrose-gradient centrifugation reveals a unique monomeric form, which sediments slightly more slowly than the monomer of the WT enzyme (Fig. 3). (ii) SDS±PAGE suggests that a similar degree of glycosylation-related microheterogeneity (Velan et al., 1993) is present in both the WT and the truncated enzyme (Fig. 3). (iii) The molecular weight of the truncated polypeptide, after removal of sugar side chains by glycanase, is 60 kDa, compared with 64 kDa for the WT polypeptide as expected. (iv) The catalytic characteristics of the truncated enzyme, as well as the inhibition constants for its inhibition by an active-centre inhibitor such as edrophonium, by a peripheral site ligand such as propidium or by the inhibitor BW284C51, which spans both sites, are essentially identical to those reported for the WT enzyme (Shafferman, Velan et al., 1992).

A general concern in molecular replacement, the structureelucidation method used for solving the mAChE and hAChE structures, is the introduction of model bias that may decrease the differences between the source and the target model during re®nement. To address this problem, we solved the structure twice, using either TcAChE±FAS-II or mAChE± FAS-II as the starting model. The fact that the re®nements starting from either of these two models converged to a virtually identical structure (Table 3) indicated that we had

produced a bona ®de unbiased model for hAChE. The quality of the re®nement for both the wild-type and the E202Q hAChE±FAS-II complexes is shown in Table 4. The electron density shows residues 5±490 and 497±543 of the hAChE polypeptide chain and all 61 residues of FAS-II. The 491±496 sequence, which lacks electron density, is homologous to the external 485±490 loop in TcAChE, which is not seen in the native structure (PDB code 2ace), although it was discerned in the recently re®ned complex with E2020 (Kryger et al., 1999; PDB code 1eve). In the mouse±FAS-II Ê structure (PDB code 1mah) solved at 3.2 A resolution, residues 4±543 have all been traced but, judging from their high temperature factors, residues 491±499 are poorly determined. The electron density of the WT hAChE structure shows the location of 390 solvent molecules and of one N-glycosylation site at N350.
3.3. Formation of the physiological dimer is independent of crystal packing

TcAChE±FAS-II, mAChE±FAS-II and hAChE±FAS-II pack very differently in their respective crystal structures (Fig. 4). Their solvent contents vary from 52% for TcAChE±
Acta Cryst. (2000). D56, 1385±1394

FAS-II through 64% for mAChE±FAS-II to 69% for hAChE± FAS-II. These differences are obviously a consequence of differences in molecular contacts between symmetry-related molecules. It is interesting to note, however, that although the hAChE±FAS-II complex shows the most extensive contacts between symmetry-related FAS-II molecules of the three, it shows the loosest overall packing of the AChE±FAS-II complex. Nevertheless, both the three-dimensional structures and the mode of association of the monomers to form the physiological dimer are essentially identical. AChE has an intrinsic tendency to dimerize through a fourhelix bundle interface, which is reinforced by a disul®de bridge between the monomers (Giles, 1997). TcAChE puri®ed from the electric organ of T. californica is a homodimer, with a disul®de bridge linking the Cys537 residues of the two monomers. The dimer is found, as expected, in every crystal form characterized for TcAChE, as well as in the TcAChE± FAS-II structure. The human WT and mutant enzymes and mAChE are recombinant proteins expressed as monomers (see x2.1), which also migrate as monomers upon sucrosegradient centrifugation. The ability to express a pure monomer rather than a mixture of monomers, dimers and tetramers was crucial to the crystallization of both mAChE and hAChE. However, at the high protein concentrations used for crystallization, the monomers, each one complexed with a FAS-II molecule, associated via the same four-helix bundle as seen in the TcAChE dimer to form dimers of the complex rather than associating in alternative ways. Close inspection and comparison of the dimer interface, which contains a four-helix bundle (helices 383±372 and 526±543), in all four crystal forms published so far for AChE reveals an unexpectedly large degree of ¯exibility in and out of the plane de®ned by the twofold axis normal to the fourhelix bundle (see Table 5). This shows that this dimer interface is readily perturbed by crystal contacts and suggests that its ¯exibility may be of biological signi®cance. Indeed, when overlaying the second molecule from all four crystal forms published so far for AChE, it becomes visibly clear that the dimerization interface varies signi®cantly not only between different species but also between the free and FAS-II bound TcAChE crystal structures.

AChE±FAS-II complexes, viz. TcAChE±FAS-II (Harel et al., 1995) and mAChE±FAS-II (Bourne et al., 1995), especially with respect to the active-site gorge. This is not surprising, considering the high degree of sequence identity between hAChE and both mAChE (87%) and TcAChE (53%) (see Fig. 2 and Table 3). Small variations can be found in some loops and in the insertion/ deletion regions. Our results validate the use of TcAChE 3.4.

The FAS-II molecule in the three complexes overlaps very well, with RMS values for C Ê atoms of 0.55, 0.59 and 0.65 A in the FAS-II complexes of hAChE versus mAChE, mAChE versus TcAChE and hAChE versus TcAChE, respectively. One of the most noticeable differences between the three structures is seen in the 319(312)±324(317) loop of the enzyme, where the backbones of the two mammalian main chains do not overlap with that of TcAChE or the TcAChE± FAS-II complex. Overall, the RMS of C atom positions between hAChE and TcAChE is Ê 1.3 A, but for these six C atoms Ê Ê it is 5 A, while it is only 0.7 A between hAChE and mAChE, the same RMS value as for the entire lengths of these two mammalian sequences (Figs. 2 and 5; Table 3). In all three cases the loop is not involved in crystal contacts. It is interesting to note that the recently determined structure of the native mouse enzyme (Bourne et al., 1999) does, however, overlap well in this region with the two mammalian/FAS-II complexes, the RMS deviation for chain A of the mouse structure for this Ê region being 0.8 A (overall Ê ), 0.7 A (overall 0.7 A) and Ê Ê 0.9 A Ê (overall 1.3 A) for the Ê 4.1 A human±FAS-II, mouse±FAS-II and TcAChE±FAS-II complexes, Figure 4 respectively.

difference between the mammalian and T. californica enzymes. Conservation of the amino-acid residues lining the activesite gorge is very high: 26 residues are identical, two are similar, viz. Thr83(Ser81) and Tyr337(Phe330), and only two residues, both at the mouth of the gorge, are different in hAChE and mAChE versus TcAChE, viz. Thr75(Glu73) and Leu76(Gln74) (Fig. 6).
3.5. Comparison of the FAS-II±AChE interaction for the three complexes

Fig. 7 depicts the contact surface between hAChE and FAS. The inhibitor is rotated 180 around the vertical axis to expose

its contact with the enzyme. The distance criterion chosen to Ê de®ne contact between atoms in FAS-II and hAChE is 4 A. The `footprint' which FAS-II leaves on hAChE is coloured red and the reciprocal `footprint' on FAS-II is coloured blue. This presentation shows how extensive the binding is. The gorge is ef®ciently sealed off from the `outside' by the multiple contacts around its rim. Examining the list of atoms participating in the enzyme±inhibitor interface (Bourne et al., 1995; Harel et al., 1995) does not reveal signi®cant differences between the three complexes. Overlaying the C atoms of the three enzymes reveals a small tilt of the toxin with respect to the enzyme between the three (Fig. 8). It is not clear if this small difference is a direct consequence of the interaction of the toxin with different enzymes or whether it is caused by different modes of crystal packing (see above).

The structure of the E202Q mutant was re®ned starting from the hAChE structure. Since, apart from their active centres, the two structures should be almost identical, the Ê resulting RMS value (0.28 A) for C atoms is not surprising. However, the observation that the respective active-site regions of the two enzymes overlap so well is both quite surprising and signi®cant to our understanding of the functional architecture of AChE (Fig. 9). Residue Glu202(199), which is adjacent to the active-site gorge Ser203(200), is one of only three acidic residues at the bottom of the active-site gorge [the other two are the catalytic triad residue

Glu334(327) and Glu450(443)] and is assumed to play an important role in AChE reactivity (Radic et al., 1992; Shafferman, Velan et al., 1992). Substitution of Glu202(199) by either a neutral (Ala, Gln) or an acidic (Asp) residue resulted in a tenfold to 100-fold decrease in the apparent bimolecular rates of hydrolysis of both the cationic substrate ATC and its neutral isoster 3,3-dimethylbutyl thioacetate (TB; Shafferman et al., 1995; Shafferman, Velan et al., 1992). This suggests that Glu202(199) participates mainly in the acylation step, rather than in substrate traf®cking and accommodation. This reduction in catalytic ef®ciency, as well as the marked concomitant decreases in rates of carbamylation ($10- to 50-fold; Ariel et al., 1998; Radic et al., 1992) and of phosphylation and ageing ($10- to 100-fold; Hosea et al., 1996; Masson et al., 1997; Ordentlich et al., 1993, 1996; Saxena et al., 1998; Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Stein et al., 1996; Shafferman, Velan et al., 1992), was rationalized in terms of interaction of residue Glu202(199) with the catalytic triad residue His447(440) (Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Stein et al., 1996). We proposed earlier that the precise positioning of the Glu202(199) carboxylate with respect to the His447(440) imidazole moieties is maintained by a network of hydrogen bonds that spans the cross-section of the active-site gorge (Ordentlich et al., 1993). The main function of the hydrogenbond network is to position the Glu202(199) carboxylate for optimal interaction with the catalytic triad (see Fig. 10). This network includes residues Glu450(443) and Tyr133(130), as well as two bridging water molecules corresponding to waters 615 and 681 in TcAChE (PDB code 2ace). Apart from its role in positioning residue Glu202(199), the network is thought to participate in stabilization of the overall architecture of the AChE active centre, since replacement of either Glu202(199) or Glu450(443) seems to affect the accommodation of both charged and non-charged ligands (Shafferman et al., 1998). In addition, substitution at position 202(199) by glutamine has a smaller effect on the af®nity toward these ligands than the corresponding substitution by alanine. This difference between these two neutral substitutions has been ascribed to the capacity of glutamine but not of alanine to maintain the hydrogen-bond network. The structure of the E202Q enzyme is compatible with this notion, since the amide moiety of glutamine participates in a hydrogen-bond network analogous to that observed in the wild-type enzyme. The ®nding that removal of the acidic residue from position 202(199) does not signi®cantly perturb the architecture of the active centre is consistent also with the role assigned to Glu202(199) in the ageing of phosphylated AChEs (Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Stein et al., 1996). In the ageing process, the Glu202(199) carboxylate is thought to participate directly in stabilization of an intermediate. Substitutions at position 202(199) by either a neutral or an acidic residue should, therefore, affect the rates of ageing similarly (Ordentlich et al., 1999; Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Stein et al., 1996). Thus, comparison of the structures of the wildtype and the E202Q hAChEs corroborates our previous conclusions regarding the functions of the hydrogen-bond network in the AChE active centre and the unique role of Glu202(199) in interaction with His447(440). In fact, a tripartite array, Glu334(327)±His447(440)±Glu202(199), was

conditions (viz. pH, ionic strength and composition) and space group. As mentioned by Koellner et al. (2000), we believe this conservation points to the importance of water for the de®nition of AChE in terms of folding and activity, a feature most likely to be shared by most proteins of this size. This work was supported by the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity under Contract Nos. DAMD17-96-C-6088 and DAMD17-00-C-0021 to AS, and DAMD17-97±2-7022 to JLS and IS, the European Union IVth Framework in Biotechnology, the Kimmelman Center for Biomolecular Structure and Assembly, Rehovot, Israel, the Nella and Leon Benoziyo Center for Neurosciences and the Dana Foundation. IS is Bernstein±Mason Professor of Neurochemistry. We thank Professor Hermona Soreq for generously providing the original DNA clone expressing hAChE.

The presence of a network of hydrogen-bonded waters in hAChE was originally deduced from model building and by analogy to the corresponding water network in the structure of TcAChE (Ordentlich et al., 1993). Our experimental con®rmation of this water network in the WT hAChE structure, as well as in that of the E202Q mutant, strengthens the case for its involvement in the functional architecture of the different AChEs. It is also an example of the striking conservation of the positions of individual waters in homologous AChE structures. In general, many of the active-site and gorge buried water molecules, as well as surface water molecules, occupy the same positions in hAChE and TcAChE. Following the ®nding of marked conservation of solvent-molecule positions in a set of TcAChE crystal structures, which included the native enzyme and its complexes with various inhibitors (Koellner et al., 2000), the present ®nding is a further manifestation of the importance of water molecules in the activesite gorge to the activity of AChE. This is a signi®cant result considering the differences between the two enzymes, which include differences in sequence, in the source of the enzyme (recombinant product versus natural enzyme), crystallization

Model for the interaction between Glu202(199) and alternate positions of the catalytic His447(440) in substrate hydrolysis. The model of the tetrahedral hAChE±ACh intermediate is based on the X-ray structure of the transition-state analogue TMTFA with TcAChE (Harel et al., 1996) and on a previously described model for the involvement of the hydrogen-bond network in catalysis, phosphylation and in ageing (Shafferman et al., 1998; Shafferman, Ordentlich, Barak, Kronman et al., 1996). During acylation His447(440) can alternate between two positions. (a) The imidazole participates in proton abstraction from O of Ê the catalytic Ser203(200) [N42 is proximal, 2.9 A away from Ser203(200) O ]. [In this orientation both His447(440) and Ser203(200) are shown in yellow.] (b) Transition of the tetrahedral intermediate into the acyl enzyme is assisted by proton transfer from the imidazolium to the choline Ê oxygen, followed by release of the choline moiety (N42 is 2.6 A from the choline oxygen). [In this orientation both His447(440) and Ser203(200) are shown in light blue.] Stabilization of the His447(440) imidazolium in the two alternate positions is facilitated by interactions with the Ê carboxylate of Glu202(199) (Glu202 O41 is 3.08±3.23 A from the centroid of the imidazolium ring).
