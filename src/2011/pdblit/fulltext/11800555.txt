Abstract We investigated the electrophoretic behavior of triplet repeat DNA fragments by capillary electrophoresis and found triplet repeat DNA fragments showed unusual mobilities compared with those of commercially available DNA molecular marker. The electrophoretic data are analyzed by means of Ogston model and the mechanism of a change in mobility of triplet repeat DNA is discussed. The unusual mobilities are caused by the characteristic higher-order structure formed by GC-rich triplet repeat DNA. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Recently, much attention has been focused on the DNA diagnosis of some kinds of genetic diseases through polymorphism analysis of disease causing gene on the human genome [1­3]. Many human diseases are caused by small alterations in DNA sequence of the disease-causing genes. The alterations in DNA sequence include many types of mutation and polymorphism on disease-causing genes, such as one or several nucleotides replacement, deletion or insertion of some sequence, differences in a variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus, and the instability of microsatellite repeat. More recently, triplet repeat expansions on the human genome are well focused, because they are reported to cause a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as the familial mental retardation, myotonic dystrophy, an autosomal dominant diseases, or Huntington disease, which are so called triplet repeat diseases [4,5]. A hallmark of most of these diseases is

the presence of anticipation, parental sex bias, and a decrease in the age at onset in consecutive generations due to the tendency of the unstable triplet repeat to lengthen when passed from one generation to the next, that cannot be explained by Mendel's Laws. Those triplet repeat expansions are not stable and it is unclear how those expansions are associated with triplet repeat diseases. In addition, even the mechanism of these diseases has not proved yet. In this study, we've attempted to establish an analytical technique for the investigation of the triplet repeat expansion on human genome and DNA diagnosis of triplet repeat diseases. During the study, we found the electrophoretic mobility of long triplet repeat DNA fragment is much larger than that of short DNA fragment, having a random sequence. Analysis of such unusual mobility of triplet repeat DNA by using Ogston model indicates that it is caused by the formation of characteristic higher-order structure of triplet repeat DNA during electrophoresis.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Samples and regents
A DNA molecular marker (20 bp DNA ladder) was purchased from Funakoshi (Tokyo, Japan). Synthetic single stranded DNA fragments were purchased from Kurabo (Okayama, Japan). Each sample was diluted with Milli-Q water to an appropriate concentration. YO-PRO-1, an intercalating dye, was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon, USA). Methylcellulose (4000 cP) obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) was used as a separation matrix. All other chemicals were of analyticalreagent grade from Wako (Osaka, Japan). The 20-bp DNA molecular marker (200 mg / ml) contains 50 fragments from 20­1000 bp in 20-bp increment each, and was diluted with Milli-Q water to 1­30 mg / ml. This marker is heated at 948C for 2 s for denaturation before injection to the capillary. Four single stranded DNA fragments with ten repeats of CNG sequence (CAG, CTG, CGG, CCG) were synthesized as the sample of triplet repeat DNA. (CCG) 10 (5.5 OD, 0.19 mM) was diluted to 0.6 nmol / ml with Milli-Q water when used, in the same say, (CGG) 10 (14 OD, 0.49 mM) was to 1.6 nmol / ml, (CAG) 10 (18 OD, 0.64 mM) was to 2.1 nmol / ml, (CTG) 10 (13 OD, 0.46 mM) was to 1.5 nmol / ml. The DNA sample were stored at 2 208C until use.

2.2. Capillary electrophoresis system
Capillary electrophoresis was performed on a Beckman P/ACE 2100 system equipped with an Argon ion laser induced fluorescence detector (LIF). DNA separation was performed in DB-17-coated capillary (360 mm O.D., 100 mm I.D., 0.1 mm coating phase thickness; J&W Scientific) with 24 cm in total length, and with 19.1 cm in effective length. DNA samples are detected by the fluorescence of DNA intercalated with YO-PRO-1 dye excited at 488 nm and detected at 560 nm. DNA samples were separated in a running buffer (50 mmol / l Tris­boric acid, pH 7.5), containing 0.7% methylcellulose and 0.1 mmol / l YO-PRO-1, at applied electric

field of 100 V/ cm, with the capillary temperature at 308C. The samples were introduced by electrokinetic injection into capillary at 5 kV for 10 s. Each performance was carried out ten times continuously. Internal capillary was washed out every time with running buffer for 3 min followed by a wash with 50% water / methanol for 3 min to evaluate the reproductivity.

3. Results and discussion As the technique for human genome analysis has developed remarkably, large number of disease-causing genes of some inherited diseases has been identified [1­3]. Triplet repeat diseases are inherited neuromuscular diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy or Huntington's disease, which are caused by the anomalous expansion of triplet repeat on the genomic DNA in a particular locus, not by generally well known genomic mutation like replacement, loss, insertion, or duplication [4]. Although such expansions are recognized even for normal people with large range of polymorphism, a mutation occurs when the number of repeat increase to some extent. The number of repeat is different by each genome, but nervous systems are damaged in common. As for the triplet repeat diseases identified so far, they can be separated into four groups according to the loci of expansion (Fig. 1): the expansions are seen on (1) 59-untranslated region (CCG repeat): FRAX, fragile X syndrome; (2) translated region (CAG repeat): DRPLA, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy; HD, Huntington's disease; MJD, Machado­Josef disease; SBMA, spinobulbar muscular atrophy; SCA,

spinocerebellar degeneration; (3) intron (GAA repeats): FA, Friedreich ataxia; (4) 39-untranslated region (CTG repeat): DM, myotonic dystrophy. The physiological function of such disease causing genes is not yet completely proved. The sequences that can cause triplet repeat diseases, identified so far, are only three kinds of CNG repeat (CAG, CTG, CCG) and GAA repeat as shown in Fig. 1. The new method has been developed for DNA diagnosis of triplet repeat diseases, termed repeat expansion detection (RED) [5]. The fragment produced by the RED reaction is single stranded triplet repeat DNA fragment, it is necessary to determine the accurate size of the fragment for the precise DNA diagnosis for triplet repeat diseases. In this study, we used some synthetic single stranded triplet repeat DNA fragments with (CNG) n sequence as a model of RED products and compare the electrophoretic behavior of triplet repeat DNA with of DNA marker to see if capillary electrophoresis can be an effective tool for the analysis of RED reaction. To discuss the electrophoretic behavior of DNA, we need to get their accurate mobility data. We examined the repeatability of migration time and mobility of triplet repeat DNA fragment as well as denaturated single-stranded DNA marker by capillary electrophoresis, using 0.7% methylcellulose as a separation matrix for DNA separation at 100 V/ cm electric field which is supposed to be the most suitable condition for the tested DNA [6­9]. The separation was performed ten times for each sample, and the capillary was washed before every run with 50% methanol / water for 3 min followed by the washing with running buffer for 3 min. We first examined commercially available 20 bp DNA ladder denatured at 948C for 2 s to single stranded as a control marker. Since the GC-contents of this molecular marker are all around 50%, it is considered to show standard electrophoretic behavior. Fig. 2 shows the electropherogram of the denatured 20 bp DNA ladder. As shown in Fig. 2, DNA fragments ranging from 20 to 240 bp were well separated only within 15 min. Each peak being separated into two, we can confirm that double stranded DNA markers were denatured to single stranded DNA. Using each migration time, the mobility and its relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) for continuous ten runs was calculated to discuss the repeatability of DNA separation by capillary electrophoresis as listed in Table 1. This table shows the repeatability for all the fragments of denatured 20 bp DNA ladder was less than 2%, implying very accurate measurement for each separation. We then investigated the electrophoretic behavior for ten repeats of CAG, CTG, CCG, and CGG fragments as the models of triplet repeat DNA. These sequences are identified as disease causing genes for triplet repeat diseases except CGG as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows the electropherogram of triplet repeat DNA fragment, (CCG) 10 , superimposed into the electropherogram of denatured 20 bp DNA ladder. It is obvious from Fig. 3 that the migration time of triplet repeat DNA fragment with 30 mer is much shorter than expected from that of DNA marker. The same results were obtained for all tested triplet repeat DNA fragments. This is one of the outstanding characters for triplet repeat DNA. Fig. 3 also indicates that additional peak appears as well as the main peak of triplet repeat DNA and we will discuss on the peak later. We also evaluate the repeatability for triplet repeat DNA fragments. The mobility and its R.S.D. for ten runs were calculated (Table 1). For the results of triplet repeat DNA fragments, calculated R.S.D. for ten runs were mostly less than 1%, showing that each separation was performed with high accuracy.

Ogston model [10­19] was applied for further consideration to understand such an unusual mobility of triplet repeat DNA fragments. Ogston model is one of the most commonly used theory for the analysis of electrophoretic behavior of small DNA fragment up to 200 bp. The mobility, m, of DNA in a polymer solution such as methylcellulose used here is related to the DNA size in base pair, N, and the polymer concentration, T, as expressed as follows:

Where m0 is the mobility of DNA in a solution without polymer matrix and C is a constant. Fig. 4 shows the Ogston plot of triplet DNA fragments, (CNG) 10 , and denaturated 20 bp DNA marker. As shown in Fig. 4, the mobilities for tested triplet repeat DNA fragments were much larger than that of DNA marker. This suggests that the contour size of triplet repeat DNA fragment becomes smaller than the marker's, because of some

characteristic higher-order structures formed by GC base pairs within triplet repeat DNA, which makes contour DNA size smaller than it should be to give a great effect, as a result, on their electrophoretic behaviors. In addition, the difference in triplet repeat sequence is found to result in the difference in their mobility, this is supposed to be because of the different stability of their higher-order structures. From recent research using NMR, it comes to be known that triplet repeat DNA with CNG sequence forms specific higher-order structure, which affects the genomic expression and is related to a particular kinds of diseases [20­23]. Shown in Fig. 5 are some hairpin folding models formed by ten repeats of triplet repeat DNA fragment [24]. For example, DNA with ten repeats of CTG sequence is thought to have two kinds of structures in the solution. With stable structure, the longest possible duplex stem made with base pairs between GC doublets and mispairs of T opposite T is yielded and because of its compact fold, the flexibility of DNA was lowered to increase its persistence length to make the contour length of the DNA smaller. On the other hand, with quasi-stable structure, one less GC base pair and a short protruding sticky end permit weak dimerization to account for the minor component with different electrophoretic behavior from the stable structure. Similar structures can be considered also for other triplet repeat DNA fragments. Thus, the difference in each triplet sequence makes the difference in the higher-order structure, and because of such compact hairpin structure of triplet repeat DNA, the mobility becomes much bigger than expected from that of DNA molecular maker. Formation of several quasi-stable structure with the different mobility from the stable structure induces the additional peak in the elec-

tropherogram as shown in Fig. 3. In other words, capillary electrophoresis is the powerful tool for the differentiation of several conformers in triplet repeat DNA fragments due to its high-resolving power. In this way, we can discuss the higher-order structure of DNA by using some experimental data obtained by capillary electrophoresis. It is obvious that capillary electrophoresis can be an effective tool for the analysis of higher-order structure of DNA in addition to NMR, gel electrophoresis, thermal melting analysis [25­28].

4. Conclusion and future applications In this study, we investigated the electrophoretic behavior of some triplet repeat DNA fragments by comparing with of commercially available DNA molecular marker using capillary electrophoresis. Initially, denatured DNA molecular marker was examined to understand the standard electrophoretic behavior for single stranded DNA fragments. As a result, we could successfully separate all the DNA fragments with very high repeatability within a very short time by capillary electrophoresis. Then, four kinds of single stranded triplet repeat DNA fragments with CNG sequence were synthesized as models of triplet repeat DNA and were tested in the same condition. We found a remarkable character on the electrophoretic behavior for triplet repeat DNA fragments. The mobilities of all tested triplet repeat DNA fragments were much larger than molecular marker's. Such an unusual mobility of triplet repeat DNA fragment is considered to be an effect of its characteristic higher-order structure formed by GC base pairs within triplet repeat DNA, and because of the characteristic higher-order structure, contour length for triplet repeat DNA fragment becomes smaller than it should be, resulted in their unusual mobility compared with molecular marker's. Recently, formation of such higher-order structures of expanded triplet repeat DNA on human genome are reported to induce a drastic change in genetic expression to cause some kinds of diseases. From these basic experiments, we are convinced that capillary electrophoresis, in the near future, can be an effective tool for DNA diagnosis of triplet repeat diseases on the basis of accurate measurement of the length of expanded triplet repeat DNA and of the precise expectation of their higher-order structure by the detail investigation on their unusual electrophoretic mobility.
