Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P ] and its $ immediate breakdown product PtdIns(3,4)P function as second # messengers in growth factor- and insulin-induced signalling pathways. One of the ways that these 3-phosphoinositides are known to regulate downstream signalling events is by attracting proteins that possess specific PtdIns-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domains to the plasma membrane. Many of these proteins, such as protein kinase B, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and the dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3phosphoinositides (DAPP1) interact with both PtdIns(3,4,5)P $ and PtdIns(3,4)P with similar affinity. Recently, a new PH# domain-containing protein, termed tandem PH-domain-containing protein (TAPP) 1, was described which is the first protein reported to bind PtdIns(3,4)P specifically. Here we describe the # crystal structure of the PtdIns(3,4)P -binding PH domain of #

H H TAPP1 at 1.4 A (1 A l 0n1 nm) resolution in complex with an ordered citrate molecule. The structure is similar to the known structure of the PH domain of DAPP1 around the D-3 and D-4 inositol-phosphate-binding sites. However, a glycine residue adjacent to the D-5 inositol-phosphate-binding site in DAPP1 is substituted for a larger alanine residue in TAPP1, which also induces a conformational change in the neighbouring residues. We show that mutation of this glycine to alanine in DAPP1 converts DAPP1 into a TAPP1-like PH domain that only interacts with PtdIns(3,4)P , whereas the alanine to glycine # mutation in TAPP1 permits the TAPP1 PH domain to interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P . $ Key words : phosphatidylinositide, protein structure, signalling.

INTRODUCTION
The 3-phosphoinositides phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P ] and PtdIns(3,4)P function as cellular second $ # messengers. Their concentrations are increased following stimulation of cells with extracellular agonists, and they are thought to trigger the activation of signal transduction networks that regulate a plethora of processes, including physiological responses to insulin and control of cell survival [1,2]. PtdIns(3,4,5)P is $ generated following growth factor\insulin-induced activation of members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) family, which phosphorylate PtdIns(4,5)P at the D-3 position of the # inositol ring [2]. PtdIns(3,4,5)P can then be converted either $ back into PtdIns(4,5)P through the action of a 3-phosphatase # termed PTEN [3] or through the action of 5-phosphatases termed SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) 1 or SHIP2 into PtdIns(3,4)P [4]. Recent work indicates that PtdIns(3,4)P can # # also be generated via a PI 3-kinase-independent pathway in response to agonists such as hydrogen peroxide [5] and crosslinking of platelet integrin receptors [6]. Much progress has been made on dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which PtdIns(3,4,5)P \PtdIns(3,4)P trigger physiological processes, $ # following the discovery that a specialized module, termed the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, is used by proteins to interact with these 3-phosphoinositides [7]. Proteins that possess PH

domains that can interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P include those $ found on the serine\threonine-specific protein kinases, protein kinase B and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 [8], the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) family of tyrosine kinases [9], certain adaptor proteins such as dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides (DAPP1) [10­13] and the Grb2-associated binder-1 [14], as well as the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), the GTPase-activating protein centaurin- [15] and the ARF guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor, general receptor for phosphoinositides-1 (GRP1) [16]. These are recruited to the plasma membrane following stimulation of cells with agonists that activate PI 3-kinase, where they are brought into the vicinity of their physiological effectors and\or are activated by phosphorylation at this location (reviewed in [8]). Although there are now estimated to be approx. 250 proteins in the human genome that possess a PH domain (S. Dowler and D. R. Alessi, unpublished work), only a small proportion of these are thought to specifically interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P and\or $ PtdIns(3,4)P . All of the PH domains whose structures have been # determined so far possess a conserved fold in which the Nterminal 80 % of the protein forms two orthogonally arranged sheets, one that contains four strands (1­4), and one that contains three strands (5­7), whereas the C-terminal region forms an amphipathic -helix [7]. The structure of three PtdIns(3,4,5)P $ binding PH domains, namely, BTK [17], DAPP1 [18] and GRP1

Restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations, PCR cloning and site-directed mutagenesis were performed using standard protocols. All DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (The Sequencing Service, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Dundee, Scotland, U.K.). Buffer A contains 50 mM Tris\HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium--glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM dithiothreitol and ` complete ' proteinase inhibitor cocktail (one tablet per 25 ml ; Roche). Buffer B contains 50 mM Tris\HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.2 M NaCl and 5 mM dithiothreitol. Buffer C contains 50 mM Mes\NaOH, pH6.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1 % (w\v) Tween-20.

[18,19], have been solved complexed to the inositol head group of PtdIns(3,4,5)P , inositol(1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate [Ins(1,3,4,5)P $ ]. These structures have provided insight into the molecular % details of the PtdIns(3,4,5)P ­PH domain interaction. The side $ chains of the 1­2 and 6­7, and in some cases 3­4, connecting loops form the inositol phosphate head group binding site. These loops are the most variable in length and sequence between PH domains and have been termed the variable loops VL1, VL2 and VL3 [20]. The basic amino acids in these loops form direct interactions with specific monoester phosphate groups of the phosphoinositol head group of PtdIns(3,4,5)P [7]. $ The structures elegantly explain why the PH domains of BTK [17] and GRP1 [18,19] can only interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P , $ and not PtdIns(3,4)P , as the high affinity binding is mediated # through interactions of the 5-phosphate on PtdIns(3,4,5)P with $ basic residues on BTK and GRP1 PH domains. In contrast, the DAPP1 PH domain interacts with similar affinity to both PtdIns(3,4,5)P and PtdIns(3,4)P . It can do so because the $ # DAPP1 PH domain, unlike those of GRP1 and BTK, forms high affinity interactions with the 3- and 4-phosphate groups of the inositol ring and not with the 5-phosphate group that is accommodated in a largely empty space in the ligand-binding pocket [18]. We recently described two related novel proteins termed tandem PH-domain-containing protein (TAPP) 1 and TAPP2, because they possessed two sequential PH domains [21]. The N-terminal PH domains of TAPP1 and TAPP2 did not interact with any phosphoinositide tested, whereas the C-terminal PH domain bound PtdIns(3,4)P with high affinity, but did not bind # significantly to PtdIns(3,4,5)P or any other phosphoinositide $ tested in a quantitative surface plasmon resonance based assay [21]. It cannot be ruled out, however, that TAPP1 and\or TAPP2 may also possess weak affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P as Ferguson $ et al. [18] have shown that the inositol head group of PtdIns(3,4,5)P , Ins(1,3,4,5)P , can interact with the C-terminal $ % PH domain of TAPP1 albeit with much weaker apparent affinity than Ins(1,3,4)P , the head group of PtdIns(3,4)P . $ # In a qualitative protein­lipid overlay, TAPP1 can also be shown to interact weakly with high concentrations of PtdIns(3,4,5)P $ ([21] and the present study). The physiological functions of TAPP1 and TAPP2 are unknown, but these proteins may mediate cellular responses that are triggered by PtdIns(3,4)P . Here, we # investigate the structural basis of the unusual specificity of the C-terminal PH domain of TAPP1, and describe the crystal H H structure of this domain at 1.4 A (1A l 0n1 nm) resolution, together with a detailed structure-based mutagenesis study, which reveal key residues that enable TAPP1 to bind PtdIns(3,4)P # specifically. The structure was solved in complex with an ordered citrate molecule, which could potentially provide a scaffold for PtdIns mimetics with possible chemotherapeutical potential.

Preparation of PH domain expression constructs
The PtdIns(3,4)P -binding PH domain of TAPP1 (TAPP1-PHCT) # was amplified by PCR using the Hi-fidelity PCR system with the full-length TAPP1 cDNA [21] as the template, and the 5h-primer GATCCATGTTTACTCCTAAACCACCTCAAGATAG and the 3h-primer GGATCCTCAGGGATGCTCAGAAGACGCA GATCT. This amplified a length of DNA encoding residues 182­304 of human TAPP1 with a stop codon immediately after position 304 which is equivalent in length to the DAPP1 PH domain fragment that was crystallized previously [18]. This fragment was subcloned into the BamH1 restriction site of the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX4T-1. The resultant construct encodes for the bacterial expression of TAPP1-PHCT with an N-terminal GST tag. This construct was used for both crystallization and for generating the mutants of TAPP1-PHCT employed in the lipid-binding experiments shown in Figure 3. The pGEX4T-1 construct encoding for the expression of the GST-fusion protein of the isolated PH domain of human DAPP1 (residues 154­273) was as described previously [10], and was used to generate the pGEX4T-1 construct expressing the isolated GST­DAPP1[Gly"(' Ala] mutant PH domain.

Expression and purification of TAPP1-PHCT for crystallization
E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the pGEX4T-1 vector encoding the expression of GST­TAPP1-PHCT were grown at 37 mC in 2 litres of Luria­Bertani broth with 50 µg\ml carbenicillin until D reached 0.7. The expression of GST­ '!! TAPP1-PHCT was induced by the addition of 250 µM isopropyl -D-thiogalactopyranoside, and the bacteria were then grown for a further 18 h at 27 mC. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3500 g for 15 min, then lysed by resuspension in 100 ml of Buffer A containing DNase and lysozyme and passing through a French Press. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 13 000 g for 30 min to remove residual debris, briefly sonicated and passed through a 0.45 µm-pore-size filter. The supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 mC in 4 ml of glutathione­Sepharose equilibrated previously in Buffer A. The beads were then washed 4 times with 5 column volumes of Buffer A, and subsequently washed 6 times with 5 column volumes Buffer B. The TAPP1PHCT domain was then separated from the GST-tag by incubating the glutathione­Sepharose beads conjugated to GST­TAPP1PHCT in a 1 : 1 volume ratio of resin\Buffer B with 100 units\ml thrombin at 4 mC overnight. The resin was centrifuged, washed twice with 2 volumes of Buffer B and the combined supernatants containing TAPP1-PHCT were applied to a 0.2 ml benzamidine­ agarose column to remove the thrombin. The eluate from this column was subsequently applied to a 1 ml glutathione­ Sepharose column equilibrated in Buffer B to remove trace contamination of GST. The yield obtained was approximately

Protein­lipid overlay assay
The wild-type and mutant PH domains of TAPP1 and DAPP1 used for the lipid-binding experiments were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously [21]. Lipid-binding studies were carried out using the protein­lipid overlay assay described previously [10,21]. Briefly, freeze-dried lipids were reconstituted in a 1 : 1 (v\v) mixture of chloroform\methanol at a concentration of 1 mM. The stock solution was serially diluted by 2-fold in a mixture of chloroform\methanol\water (1 : 2 : 0.8, by vol.) and 1 µl of this solution, corresponding to between 1 pmol to 1 nmol of phosphoinositide, was spotted on to HybondC-extra nitrocellulose membrane, which was allowed to dry at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Buffer C containing 2 % (w\v) BSA, and were then incubated in Buffer C containing 2 % BSA and 10 nM of the indicated purified wild-type or mutant GST-fusion PH domains of DAPP1 and TAPP1. After overnight incubation at 4 mC with gentle rocking, the membranes were washed 5 times during a 40 min period in Buffer C, then incubated with a 1 : 2000 dilution of a monoclonal anti-GST antibody in Buffer C containing 2 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed a further 5 times during a 40 min period in Buffer C and then incubated with a 1 : 5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in Buffer C containing 2 % BSA for 1 h. The membranes were washed 8 times over 1 h and detection of GST-fusion proteins bound to the membrane was achieved using enhanced chemiluminescence.

8 mg of TAPP1-PHCT domain per 2 litres of E. coli culture. TAPP1-PHCT was analysed by SDS\PAGE followed by Coomasie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel, and was found to be essentially homogeneous. It was analysed by electrospray mass spectroscopy, revealing a major single species with a molecular mass of 14138.39 Da, close to the predicted mass of 14162.24 Da for the TAPP1-PHCT fragment.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Overall structure of the TAPP1 PH domain
The C-terminal PtdIns(3,4)P -binding PH domain of human # TAPP1 (residues 182­304, termed TAPP1-PHCT) was expressed in E. coli, purified and crystallized as described in the Materials and methods section. Its structure was solved by molecular H replacement and refined to 1.4 A resolution with Rcryst l 0.171 and Rfree l 0.228 (Figure 1A and Table 1). As expected, the overall fold of the protein is similar to that determined previously for PH domain structures [7]. Strands 1­4 are arranged in an anti-parallel fashion, forming a sheet, which is approximately stacked orthogonally on to another sheet formed by strands 5­7 and 1. One open end of this -clamp structure is covered by the C-terminal helix. Like other PH domain structures, the other open end is surrounded by loops 1­2, 3­4 and 6­7, also termed VL1, VL2 and VL3 respectively. These loops form a bowl shape into which several conserved basic amino acids are clustered, forming the putative phosphoinositide binding site (Figure 1A). Mutation of one of these residues, Arg#"# to leucine, is known to prevent TAPP1 from binding to PtdIns(3,4)P [21] # (Figure 1A). Analysis of surface potential with the program GRASP [27] shows this bowl shape and its associated overall positive charge, whereas on the opposite side of the molecule a cluster of negatively charged residues can be observed (Figure 1B). The resulting dipole is thought to help the orientation and docking of the PH domain on to the negatively charged membrane surface [7]. At the initial stages of the refinement, it became clear that the presumed PtdIns(3,4)P binding pocket was occupied by an # ordered small molecule (Figure 1A). This density was not

Crystallization and data collection
The TAPP1-PHCT protein was concentrated to a final concentration of 14.5 mg\ml (as determined by a Bradford assay) using a VivaSpin concentrator. Hanging drops were formed by mixing 1 µl of protein solution with 1 µl of a mother liquor solution containing 0.085 M sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 25.5 % (w\v) PEG 4000, 15 % (v\v) glycerol and 0.17 M ammonium acetate. The drop was then equilibrated by vapour diffusion against a reservoir containing mother liquor. Crystals were grown at 20 mC and appeared after 1 day, growing to 0.3 mmi0.15 mmi 0.1 mm over 6 days. Crystals were frozen straight from the drop H without additional cryo protection. Data were collected to 1.4 A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) beamline ID14-EH4, using an ADSC Q4 CCD detector, H at a wavelength of 1.0 A. The temperature of the crystals was maintained at 100 K using a nitrogen cryostream. Data were processed using the HKL package [22], statistics are shown in Table 1.

Structure determination and refinement
The structure of the TAPP1 PH domain was solved by molecular replacement with AMoRe [23], using the DAPP1 structure [18] as a search model. A single solution was obtained with an Rfactor of 0.501 and a correlation coefficient of 0.392. The resulting model phases were used as the input for warpNtrace [24] which was able to build 92 out of the 123 possible residues. Iterative model building in O [25] together with refinement in CNS

interpreted until the last stages of the refinement, when it was modelled as a citrate molecule, which was present at a concentration of 85 mM in the crystallization mother liquor. The carboxylate moieties make several salt bridges with arginines\ lysines in the pocket (Figure 1A). Exhaustive soaking experiments of TAPP1-PHCT crystals with Ins(1,3,4)P (the head $ group of PtdIns(3,4)P ) were performed. Unfortunately, in# spection of FokFc difference maps revealed that the citrate molecule had not been replaced with the soaked head group. In addition numerous, co-crystallization screens with Ins(1,3,4)P $ did not yield any crystals. The TAPP1-PHCT­citrate complex may provide a scaffold for the design of PtdIns(3,4)P \ # PtdIns(3,4,5)P mimetics. These compounds could selectively $ block the recruitment of proteins carrying PH domains to membranes, thus interfering with the signal transduction cascades. Alternatively, they might mimic the effects that phosphoinositides have on these PH domains, thus activating signal transduction cascades. It should be noted that in the crystal structure of DAPP1 and GRP1 PH domains, phosphate and sulphate molecules that were present at high concentrations in the crystallization mother liquor, have also been observed in the 3-phosphoinositide binding site [18,19]. Interestingly, an ordered citrate molecule has also been observed in the structure of a FYVE domain, where it occupies the PtdIns 3-phosphate binding site, although further investigation is required to establish whether this marks the genuine PtdIns 3-phosphate binding site [28].

A structure-based sequence alignment of the 3-phosphoinositide-binding PH domains of DAPP1 and TAPP1 is shown in Figure 2(a). The sequence identity between the two PH domains is 37 %. VL1, VL2 and VL3 all have the same length in TAPP1 and DAPP1, and exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation. The only significant sequence differences between TAPP1 and DAPP1 in these regions are located in VL1 where a Gly-Leu-Val sequence in DAPP1 is replaced by Ala-Val-Met in TAPP1 (Figure 2a). In order to address whether this difference in sequence between the DAPP1 and TAPP1 PH domains accounts for the ability of DAPP1 to bind both PtdIns(3,4,5)P and $ PtdIns(3,4)P , whereas TAPP1 can only bind PtdIns(3,4)P , we # # superimposed the structure of the complex of DAPP1 and inositol (1,3,4,5)P with the equivalent region of TAPP1 (Figure % 2b) to generate a model of a TAPP1-PHCT­PtdIns complex (Figure 2b). The 1-, 3- and 4-phosphate groups are surrounded by identical residues (mostly arginines and lysines) in DAPP1 and TAPP1 (Figures 2a and 2b). This includes Arg#"#, whose mutation to a leucine is known to prevent TAPP1 from binding to PtdIns(3,4)P [21] (Figure 2b). In contrast, the positioning of # the residues surrounding the 5-phosphate in the PH domain of DAPP1 and TAPP1-PHCT differ significantly. DAPP1 can bind to both PtdIns(3,4,5)P and PtdIns(3,4)P because the 5-phos$ # phate can be accommodated in the ligand-binding pocket. Furthermore, in comparison with the 1-, 3- and 4-phosphate groups (see the Introduction section), the 5-phosphate in the DAPP1-PH­PtdIns(3,4,5)P complex has relatively weak inter$ actions with the protein, through two hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogens of Leu"(( and Val"() (Figure 2b). In the TAPP1-PHCT structure, there is no room for the 5-phosphate to bind. If a 5-phosphate is positioned in TAPP1-PHCT in the same

Another notable steric H clash is Val#!%-C with an oxygen on the 5-phosphate (2.2 A). In addition, the two phosphate­backbone hydrogen bonds seen in the DAPP1-PH­Ins(1,3,4,5)P complex can no longer be formed % if Ins(1,3,4,5)P is modelled into the TAPP1 phosphoinositide % binding site. It is possible that it is not only the steric effects caused by introduction of a C atom at position 203 which could prevent TAPP1 interacting with a phosphoinositide bearing a 5-phosphate group. Inspection of the backbone conformation reveals that Gly"(' in DAPP1 lies at  l k83m,  l k83m in the Ramachandran plot, whereas for the equivalent Ala#!$ in TAPP1  l k79m,  l k31m. According to the PROCHECK definition [30], the backbone conformation at residue 176 in DAPP1 is near the edge of an ` additional allowed ' region in the Ramachandran plot, whereas residue 203 in TAPP1 is near the centre of a highly populated allowed region (right-handed -helical). Thus it is possible that by the introduction of a C beyond the glycine

backbone, the VL1 loop is forced into a different conformation to relieve the strain introduced in the backbone. This would H cause the observed shifts of up to 4.1 A in C positions towards the site of PtdIns binding, resulting in the additional unfavourable changes in interaction with a phosphoinositide bearing a 5-phosphate.

Mutagenesis of residues located in the VL1 loop of the TAPP1 and DAPP1 PH domains
The structural data indicate that mutation of Gly"(' in DAPP1 to alanine, the residue found at the equivalent position in TAPP1, may inhibit the binding of DAPP1 to PtdIns(3,4,5)P , but not $ affect its interaction with PtdIns(3,4)P . To investigate this # possibility, we employed the protein­lipid overlay assay [31,21] in which serial dilutions of phosphoinositides were spotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with the isolated PH domain of wild-type DAPP1 and the DAPP1[G176A] mutant. The membranes were then washed and immunoblotted with a anti-GST antibody to detect GST-fusion proteins bound to the membrane by virtue of their interaction with lipid.

Additional NaCl was added to the samples containing 0 mM and 10 mM trisodium citrate in order to ensure that the ionic strength was the same as the sample containing 100 mM trisodium citrate. Serial dilutions of the indicated phosphoinositides (1 nmol, 500 pmol, 250 pmol, 125 pmol, 63 pmol, 31 pmol, 16 pmol, 8 pmol, 4 pmol, 2 pmol, 1 pmol and 0.5 pmol) were used. Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.

onstrate that, as reported previously [10,11], wild-type DAPP1 interacts with both PtdIns(3,4,5)P and PtdIns(3,4)P (Figure $ # 3A), but as predicted the mutant DAPP1[G176A] binds to PtdIns(3,4)P (with similar apparent affinity as wild-type # DAPP1), but does not bind detectably to PtdIns(3,4,5)P (Figure $ 3B). A similar situation has been observed in the structure of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, which, unlike other tyrosine phosphatases, binds peptides with a tandem of phosphotyrosines [32]. Binding of the second phosphotyrosine is facilitated by introduction of a glycine which creates an extra pocket, harbouring the phosphate group. Mutation of this glycine to large residues significantly impairs binding of peptides with the phosphotyrosine tandem [32]. We next mutated either individually or in combination the residues Ala-Val-Met in the VL1 of TAPP1 to residues present in the equivalent region of DAPP1 (Gly-Leu-Val) to determine whether we could generate a TAPP1 mutant that could interact with PtdIns(3,4,5)P , as well as PtdIns(3,4)P . The TAPP1 mutant $ # in which Ala#!$ (the residue equivalent to Gly"(' in DAPP1) was changed to a glycine residue, TAPP1[A203G], showed significant interaction with PtdIns(3,4,5)P compared with the wild$ type TAPP1, but still bound to PtdIns(3,4)P with a higher # affinity (Figures 3C and 3D). In contrast, the TAPP1[V204L] mutant only interacted with PtdIns(3,4)P (Figure 3E). The # TAPP1[M205V] mutant also bound exclusively to PtdIns(3,4)P , # with a somewhat higher affinity than wild-type TAPP1 (Figure 3F). A mutant of TAPP1 in which the three residues in the VL1 of TAPP1 (i.e. Ala-Val-Met) were altered to those found in DAPP1 (i.e. Gly-Leu-Val) interacted with moderately higher affinity with PtdIns(3,4,5)P than the TAPP1[A203G] mutant $ (compare Figures 3D and 3G). We then mutated either individually or in combination further residues in the Ala-Val-Met motif of TAPP1 to glycine residues. The TAPP1[V204G] mutant only interacted with PtdIns(3,4)P like wild-type TAPP1 (Figure #

3H). In contrast, the TAPP1[A203G\V204G] mutant interacted with PtdIns(3,4,5)P with significantly higher affinity than the $ TAPP1[A203G] mutant and, remarkably, even possessed higher affinity for PtdIns(3,4,5)P than PtdIns(3,4)P (Figure 3I). We $ # also generated a mutant TAPP1 in which all three residues in the Ala-Val-Met motif were changed to glycine, but this mutant failed to interact with either PtdIns(3,4)P or PtdIns(3,4,5)P # $ (Figure 3J). To the C-terminus of the Ala-Val-Met sequence in TAPP1 there is a threonine residue (Thr#!(), whereas in DAPP1 this residue is an asparagine (Asn")!) (Figure 2a). However, this difference does not appear to contribute to the differences in lipid-binding specificity of TAPP1 and DAPP1, because a mutant TAPP1 in which this threonine residue is changed to asparagine still interacted specifically with PtdIns(3,4)P (Figure 3K). # As the TAPP1-PHCT structure obtained had an ordered citrate molecule bound in the lipid-binding pocket (Figures 1A and 2b) and we were unable to obtain crystals of TAPP1 bound to Ins(1,3,4)P , we verified whether citrate could inhibit the binding $ of TAPP1-PHCT and the isolated PH domain of DAPP1 to 3phosphoinositides. We observed moderate inhibition at 10 mM citrate, but at a concentration of 100 mM citrate (similar to that present in the crystallization mother liquor) the ability of TAPP1PHCT to interact with PtdIns(3,4)P and the DAPP1 PH domain # to bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P and PtdIns(3,4)P was significantly re$ # duced (Figure 4). As the apparent Kd values of TAPP1 for PtdIns(3,4)P and of DAPP1 for PtdIns(3,4,5)P \PtdIns(3,4)P # $ # are estimated to be sub-micromolar [10,21], citrate must therefore interact with these PH domains with 10& lower affinity than the natural phosphoinositide ligand(s) of these PH domains. A model of citrate bound to the PH domains of DAPP1 and TAPP1 is shown in Figure 2(b). Together with the structure, these results suggest that polycarboxylates could be used as a scaffold for the design of PH-domain-specific PtdIns mimetics, which could act as activators or inhibitors.
