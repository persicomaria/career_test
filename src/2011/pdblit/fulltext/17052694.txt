The POZ/BTB domain is an evolutionarily conserved motif found in approximately 40 zinc-finger transcription factors (POZ-ZF factors). Several POZ-ZF factors are implicated in human cancer, and POZ domain interaction interfaces represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Miz-1 (Myc-interacting zinc-finger protein) is a POZ-ZF factor that regulates DNA-damage-induced cell cycle arrest and plays an important role in human cancer by virtue of its interaction with the c-Myc and BCL6 oncogene products. The Miz-1 POZ domain mediates both self-association and the recruitment of non-POZ partners. POZ-ZF factors generally function as homodimers, although higher-order associations and heteromeric interactions are known to be physiologically important; crucially, the interaction interfaces in such large complexes have not been characterised. We report here the crystal structure of the Miz-1 POZ domain up to 2.1 Å resolution. The tetrameric organisation of Miz-1 POZ reveals two types of interaction interface between subunits; an interface of alpha-helices resembles the dimerisation interface of reported POZ domain structures, whereas a novel beta-sheet interface directs the association of two POZ domain dimers. We show that the beta-sheet interface directs the tetramerisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain in solution and therefore represents a newly described candidate interface for the higher-order homo- and heterooligomerisation of POZ-ZF proteins in vivo. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

gical processes and is found in approximately 40 zinc-finger transcription factors (POZ-ZF factors).1 Most POZ-ZF factors play roles in cell proliferation and development, and many have also been implicated as oncogenes or tumour suppressors in human cancer;2 structural analysis of POZ domains will ultimately aid in the design of cancer therapies that target POZ-ZF function.3 Miz-1 (Myc-interacting zinc-finger protein4) is a POZ-ZF factor that activates genes involved in cell cycle arrest, differentiation and DNA-damage responses. The transcriptional properties of Miz-1 are modulated by the binding of the c-Myc protooncogene product to residues near its zinc-finger domain, leading to aberrant gene regulation in tumours. Many biological activities of Miz-1 are mediated by its N-terminal POZ domain, which directs both self-association and the recruitment of non-POZ partners. POZ-ZF proteins are generally

considered to function as biological homodimers via a POZ­POZ interaction; crystal structures of three POZ-ZF POZ domains, PLZF (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger),5,6 BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6)7 and LRF (leukaemia/lymphoma-related factor),8,9 reveal tightly intertwined dimers with an extensive hydrophobic interface. Different POZ domains recruit specific non-POZ partners, thereby conferring distinct biological properties on the various POZ-ZF factors. Miz-1 is regulated during DNAdamage responses by the recruitment of TOPBP1 (topoisomerase II-binding protein),10 and its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase HECTH9 (homologous to E6-AP carboxy-terminus)11 modulates the ubiquitination, and therefore transcriptional properties, of c-Myc. Higher-order oligomers12 and heteromeric interactions 13 between different POZ-ZF factors are thought to be physiologically important, although the interaction interfaces in these complexes have not been characterised. We report here the crystal structure of the tetrameric Miz-1 POZ domain. The oligomeric organisation of Miz-1 POZ reveals a novel beta-sheet interaction interface that directs the association of two POZ domain dimers. We show that this region mediates the association of Miz-1 POZ dimers in solution and therefore represents a newly described candidate interface for the higherorder homo- and hetero-oligomerisation of POZ-ZF proteins in vivo. General organisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain The entire Miz-1 POZ domain (Miz-1 residues 2­ 115) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and crystallised. The crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to R = 18.1% and Rfree = 22.9% at 2.1 Å resolution (Table 1 and Fig. 1a), with a single tetramer per asymmetric unit. All residues were built in the model. The Miz-1 POZ tetramer may be described as an association of two dimers, each of which resembles the reported PLZF, BCL6 and LRF POZ structures (Fig. 1). The assembly has two distinct types of interface between subunits: the A:B and C:D interfaces resemble those described in PLZF, BCL6 and LRF, whereas A:D and B:C are novel; this tetrameric organisation of POZ-ZF POZ domains has not been observed previously. Estimates of the chemical stability of assemblies in the crystal lattice 14 suggest that the Miz POZ tetramer represents a stable physiological association that dissociates into dimers specifically across the A:D and B:C interfaces. The AB and CD dimers are predicted to be stable, in agreement with reports that POZ-ZF POZ domains are obligate homodimers.15 In contrast, dissociation of the tetramer across the A:B and C:D interfaces is not expected to occur, as the resulting AD and BC dimers are predicted to be unstable.

We refer to A:B and C:D as the Miz-1 POZ domain dimerisation interfaces, and to A:D and B:C as tetramerisation interfaces. The Miz-1 POZ domain core and dimerisation interface POZ domains of the POZ-ZF factors are highly conserved, and a sequence alignment of Miz-1 with PLZF, BCL6 and LRF reveals identities of 33%, 36% and 40%, respectively (Fig. 2a). The PLZF, BCL6 and LRF POZ domains each comprise six alphahelices and five beta-strands, with a central core of alpha-helices being flanked at the top and bottom by short beta-sheets (described according to the orientation of the BCL6 dimer shown in Fig. 1a). Notably, Miz-1 lacks residues that form the 1 strand of PLZF, BCL6 and LRF; the organisation of secondary structure elements is otherwise identical, and we used the same nomenclature for their designation. The overall organisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain core is the same as PLZF, BCL6 and LRF (Fig. 1b); compared to Miz-1, the RMSD values of C atom

Crystal Structure of the Miz-1 POZ Domain

Fig. 1. Structure of the Miz-1 POZ domain. (a) Ribbon representation of the Miz-1 POZ domain tetramer. Subunits A­D are indicated in different colours. The secondary structure elements of the A-chain and of the A:D interface are shown. The structure of the BCL6 POZ domain (PDB accession code 1r28) is shown for comparison; the box indicates the 1­5 beta-sheet of the BCL6 dimerisation interface that is absent in Miz-1 (positions on the partner chain of BCL6 are indicated with primes). The Miz-1 POZ domain (residues 2­115) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. The glutathione S-transferase tag was removed by cleavage with PreScission protease, and the Miz-1 POZ domain fragment was purified by chromatography on Q-Sepharose, Resource Q and Supadex 75. Crystals of the purified Miz-1 POZ domain were obtained by hanging-drop vapour diffusion against 20% polyethylene glycol 3350; 20% polyethylene glycol 400; 200 mM MgCl2; and 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5). Details of plasmid construction, protein purification, X-ray data collection and structure determination are reported in Supplementary Data.20-27 (b) Superposition of POZ domain C atoms for Miz-1, BCL6, PLZF and LRF. Stereoimage of the superpositions of POZ domain dimers (BCL6, accession code 1r28; PLZF, accession code 1buo; LRF, accession code 2nn2; the Miz-1 dimer corresponds to chains A and B). Miz-1 (green), BCL6 (cyan), LRF (magenta), PLZF (yellow).

positions for monomers are 2.64 Å (PLZF), 2.36 Å (BCL6) and 2.22 Å (LRF). The 5 and 6 helices are in a slightly different position in Miz-1 compared with the reported POZ domains, being rotated outwards away from the core of the molecule. The positioning of [5 + 6] in BCL6, PLZF and LRF may be stabilised by interactions between 6 and 1 in these structures. The C-chain 6 helix was somewhat disordered in our model, with relatively high B-factors and poor electron density in this region. The corresponding residues were well ordered in all other chains, and we therefore modelled this region using the superposition of chain A. These features of the C-chain 6 helix probably reflect a lack of crystal contacts involving these residues in comparison to chains A, B and D. Notably, the elongin POZ

domain lacks an 6 helix, and the position of 6 in other POZ-ZF POZ domains is more variable than the other secondary structure elements, suggesting that this region does not play a critical role in the stabilisation of the POZ monomer core. The organisation of the Miz-1 POZ dimerisation interface differs from PLZF, BCL6 and LRF due to the absence of the 1 strand (Fig. 1). The interfaces of PLZF, BCL6 and LRF have previously defined distinct regions: a hydrophobic interface of alphahelices at the centre of the structure is formed by the close packing of 1, 2 and 3 from each subunit, whereas two beta-sheet interfaces at the bottom are formed by the interaction of 1 of one chain with 5 from its partner (1­5; Fig. 1a, box). The lower beta-sheet interaction interface, which accounts for

40­50% of the surface area buried upon the dimerisation of the PLZF, BCL6 and LRF POZ domains, is notably absent in Miz-1. Although the 1­5 sheet cannot form in Miz-1, 5 residues are found in the same location in all four structures. The A:B and C:D interfaces of Miz-1 POZ resemble the central region of the PLZF, BCL6 and LRF dimerisation interfaces, although the 1 helix is slightly longer in Miz-1. The buried surface area in the Miz-1 A:B and C:D interfaces is lower than the overall dimerisation interface of other POZ domains {values are 1244 Å2 per monomer for Miz-1; 1928 Å2 for PLZF [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1buo]; 1706 Å2 for BCL6 [PDB accession code 1r28]; and 1621 Å2 for LRF [PDB accession code 2nn2]}, but higher than the isolated central interfaces of these structures; these differences reflect the lack of 1 and longer 1 region in Miz-1. Importantly, the natural

absence of an N-terminal 1 strand does not prevent the dimerisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain. Tetramerisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain Tetramerisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain results from the association of two dimers at solventexposed beta-sheets, 3­2­4, located at the top of each monomeric subunit. This interaction leads to the displacement of an outer 4 strand from one of the subunits of each constituent dimer, generating a tetramer with two five-stranded beta-sheet interaction interfaces organised as 3A­2A­4D­2D­3D and 3B­2B­4B­2C­3C (Figs. 1a and 2b); the two displaced 4 strands adopt an alpha-helical conformation and lie parallel with 5 on one face of the tetramer (Figs. 1a and 2b, helix xA ). The rearrangement of secondary structure elements is

824 frequently observed in protein interactions involving beta-sheets, and the conversion of 4 to x during the tetramerisation of the Miz-1 POZ domain may be facilitated by the flexibility of the loop between 3 and 4. This displacement of 4 leads to loss of the original symmetry axis of the POZ dimer; the 2-fold rotation axis of the Miz-1 POZ tetramer is perpendicular to its largest face and extends through a hole in its centre. The tetramerisation interface is stabilised mainly by beta-sheet interactions and by a salt bridge between Asp58B/D at the N-terminus of 4 and Lys39 at the N-terminus of 2A/C. The organisation of the Miz-1 POZ tetramer is unlike the POZ/T1 domain tetramer of the potassium ion channels; these latter structures have polar interaction interfaces, with the tetramer subunits being arranged around a 4-fold symmetry axis running through a central pore in the ion channel.16 Tetramerisation of POZ-ZF POZ domains has not been reported previously; although POZ dimers have been observed to interact via their lower 1­5 sheets in some crystal lattices (e.g., Ahmad et al.6), this interaction has not been confirmed in solution and may be due to crystal packing. We therefore determined the oligomeric state of the Miz1 POZ domain in solution by analytical ultracentrifugation. Both velocity and equilibrium centrifugation indicated that the protein was in a dynamic tetramer­dimer equilibrium, with a Kd of approximately 110 M (data presented in Supplementary Data). In order to confirm the role of the beta-sheet

interface in POZ domain tetramerisation, we mutated the outer 4 strand to a sequence not expected to form stable interactions internally within beta-sheets17; the Miz-1 POZ 4 strand was shortened by one residue, and a centrally located valine mutated to an aspartate residue (V60D;61 mutant; Fig. 2c). This mutant POZ domain sedimented solely as a dimer when analysed by analytical ultracentrifugation (data presented in Supplementary Data), suggesting that the 4 strand is critical for tetramer formation. Surface features of the Miz-1 POZ domain Surface features of POZ-ZF POZ domains should determine interactions with specific non-POZ partners. For example, BCL6 recruits the SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) transcriptional corepressor to lateral grooves (Fig. 1a) that extend from the dimer interface across the bottom of the molecule.7 A charged pocket that lies at the top between the dimer subunits (Fig. 1a) has also been implicated in corepressor recruitment in PLZF and BCL6; the depth of this pocket and its surrounding charge differ between various POZ domains. Since the Miz1 POZ domain exists in a dimer­tetramer equilibrium, its potential interaction surfaces change according to oligomeric state. Notably, tetramerisation blocks access to the charged pocket (D25; K39); although these residues are conserved in Miz-1, no

function has been ascribed to this region, and there is no evidence that the Miz-1 POZ domain recruits corepressors. The two faces of the Miz-1 POZ tetramer are nonidentical, with the two x helices that form during tetramerisation being exposed on the same side. The bottom of the Miz-1 dimer is less concave than the reported POZ domains and has a marked protrusion in its centre; this reflects the absence of 1, the rotation of 6 and the longer 1 regions in Miz-1. The overall surface charge distribution of the Miz-1 POZ tetramer is nonuniform (Fig. 3). Both large faces have an overall neutral charge, whereas the sides are strikingly acidic. The charge distribution on the bottom surfaces of the various POZ domain dimers is very different, consistent with the role of the lateral groove in the recruitment of specific non-POZ partners (Fig. 3). Implications The novel cross-dimer beta-sheet interaction interface of the Miz-1 POZ tetramer mediates a dynamic reversible association of POZ domain dimers. The biological activity of the POZ-ZF factors may be modulated by specific hetero-oligomerisation, although, crucially, the stoichiometry of such complexes has not been rigorously analysed; it will now be pertinent to determine whether the beta-sheet interaction interface described here may be used to modulate Miz-1 function via the formation of combinatorial heterotetramers with other POZ-ZF proteins. Although homotetramers have not been reported in other POZ-ZF factors, it is possible that they may use the 3­2­4 interface to direct the formation of heterotetramers. Interaction interfaces are used to direct specific combinatorial patterns of homo- and hetero-oligomerisation in many other systems: for example, in the Myc/Mad/Max transcription factor network, the helix­loop­helix leucine zipper region of Max mediates both homo- and heterodimer formation, whereas the Myc and Mad proteins use this same region solely for heterodimerisation.18 Interestingly, the T1/POZ domain of the potassium channels directs ion channel diversity via the formation of specific heterotetramers; it will be relevant to determine whether the POZ domain plays a similar role in determining the specificity of hetero-oligomer formation in the POZ-ZF factors.
