Introduction Riboflavin synthase (EC 2.5.1.9, RS) catalyzes the transfer of a butane unit from one molecule of 6,7dimethyl-8-(1 -D-ribityl)-lumazine (DMRL) to another DMRL molecule in forming riboflavin and 4-ribitylamino5-amino-2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (RAADP), thus defining the terminal reaction of riboflavin biosynthesis (Figure 1) [1­3]. In this event, it is proposed that a nucleophile (either a water molecule, as in the reaction in the absence of an enzyme, or a protein residue) adds to the pteridine ring of the butane-donor DMRL molecule, followed by the regiospecific transfer of the butane unit to the butane-acceptor DMRL molecule in several steps that are likely mediated by general acid and general base groups on the enzyme [2­6]. The binding sites of the yeast RS for the butane-donor and butane-acceptor molecules of DMRL are differentiated by their specificities for alternate substrates [2, 7], and those of the Bacillus subtilis enzyme are differentiated by their binding preferences for nonsubstrate ligands [8, 9]. In addition to its aspects of mechanistic interest, RS is an attractive target for the design of antimicrobial agents, and several inhibitors of the enzyme have been reported [2, 6­13]. The B. subtilis RS appears in two forms, light and heavy [14]. The light form is a homotrimer of molecular weight 70 kDa, and the heavy form is the trimer encapsulated by a 60 subunit icosahedral capsid of DMRL synthase that has a molecular mass in excess of 1 MDa. Structural features of the heavy RS from B. subtilis have been studied extensively, and there is a low-resolution X-ray structure of the complex [15]. However, the structure provided no information on the RS component of the complex. More recently, higher resolution structures of the B. subtilis DMRL synthase and the enzyme from three other species, all in the absence of RS, have been reported [16­18]. A sequence alignment of the N-terminal 96 residues with the remainder of the B. subtilis RS shows 26 identical residues and 23 conservative substitutions, and, on this basis, it was proposed that the tertiary structure of the monomer may exhibit pseudo two-fold symmetry, perhaps owing to the functional need to bind two DMRL molecules simultaneously in the active site to commence the catalytic cycle [19]. The same work suggested that the trimer may have three-fold symmetry in addition to the pseudo two-fold symmetry, and this idea was supported by preliminary X-ray diffraction data on the E. coli RS that suggested pseudo 32 symmetry [20]. Countering the three-fold symmetry proposal is a series of NMR studies on the binding of fluorinated, nonsubstrate analogs of DMRL to the B. subtilis RS trimer with compelling evidence that there are three different binding environments of 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the ligands [6, 8, 9]. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli RS (light form) and its relationship to the historic work mentioned above.

Summary Background: Riboflavin synthase catalyzes the dismutation of two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-(1 -D-ribityl)lumazine to yield riboflavin and 4-ribitylamino-5-amino2,6-dihydroxypyrimidine. The homotrimer of 23 kDa subunits has no cofactor requirements for catalysis. The enzyme is nonexistent in humans and is an attractive target for antimicrobial agents of organisms whose pathogenicity depends on their ability to biosynthesize riboflavin. Results: The first three-dimensional structure of the en° zyme was determined at 2.0 A resolution using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method on the Escherichia coli protein containing selenomethionine residues. The homotrimer consists of an asymmetric assembly of monomers, each of which comprises two similar barrels and a C-terminal helix. The similar barrels within the monomer confirm a prediction of pseudo two-fold symmetry that is inferred from the sequence similarity between the two halves of the protein. The barrels closely resemble folds found in phthalate dioxygenase reductase and other flavoproteins. Conclusions: The three active sites of the trimer are proposed to lie between pairs of monomers in which residues conserved among species reside, including two Asp-His-Ser triads and dyads of Cys-Ser and HisThr. The proposed active sites are located where FMN (an analog of riboflavin) is modeled from an overlay of the barrels of phthalate dioxygenase reductase and riboflavin synthase. In the trimer, one active site is formed, and the other two active sites are wide open and exposed to solvent. The nature of the trimer configuration suggests that only one active site can be formed and be catalytically competent at a time.

Results and Discussion The three-dimensional structure of E. coli RS was deter° mined at 2.7 A resolution by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method using crystals of the SeMet (selenomethionine) protein (Table 1). The model for ° the native enzyme was refined to 2.0 A resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 23.9% and an Rfree [21] of 29.9% (Table 2). The asymmetric unit contains three monomers (molecules A, B, and C) that are not related by noncrystallographic three-fold symmetry (see below). For the most part, the electron density provides excellent definition of the protein (Figure 2). The model includes residues 1­206 in molecule A, lacking 7 C-terminal residues. The model for molecule B has an additional undefined region and includes residues 1­113 and 119­ 206. Molecule C has additional disordered regions, and residues 1­90, 97­110, and 121­201 are included in the model. None of the undefined regions are located in or near the proposed active site discussed below. The trimeric form of the enzyme observed in the asymmetric unit is the form that is found in solution [22]. The Overall Structure RS is an protein. The RS monomer consists of two barrels with nearly identical folds, the N-terminal

barrel (N barrel, residues 4­86) and the C-terminal barrel ° (C barrel, residues 101­184), and a 32 A-long C-terminal helix (residues 186­206) (Figure 3a). The N and C barrels have the same connectivities (Figure 3b), and their pseudo two-fold symmetry is obvious (Figure 3c), thus confirming the prediction of pseudo two-fold symmetry that was based on the sequence similarity between the N-terminal and C-terminal halves of the B. subtilis RS [19] and between those of the E. coli RS [20, 22]. Indeed, an alignment of the two halves of the E. coli RS shows 25 identical residues, and the locations of the secondary structure elements are closely matched (Figure 3d). However, the active site is not located within the monomer, as was proposed (see below). The trimer of the asymmetric unit is held together by numerous interactions in a tight intermolecular interface between the C barrel of molecule A (15 residues within ° 3.5 A) and the N barrel of molecule C (16 residues within ° 3.5 A), a few interactions between the residues (85­104) that form loops connecting the C barrel and N barrel of molecules A and B, and a three-helix bundle formed by the C-terminal helices from each of the three monomers (Figures 4a and 4b). The structures of the three monomers within the trimer are similar, but not identical, as seen in an overlay (Figure 4c). Not only do the monomers have asymmetric relationships with one another, but their individual folding domains have differences (see legend of Figure 4c). Notably, molecules A and B (but not A and C or B and C) are related by a 124 rotation, which may explain the three-fold symmetry function found in the partial X-ray data set of the E. coli RS [20]. Molecules A and C are related by an 85 rotation, and molecules B and C are related by a 151 rotation. A study of C-terminal deletion mutants of the B. subtilis RS has shown that as many as 18 of the residues may be removed without suffering a loss in catalytic activity [8]. A sequence alignment of the two proteins indicates that the 18 C-terminal residues removed from the B. subtilis RS corresponds to 11 residues in the E. coli RS. Removing the 11 residues from the E. coli RS would leave all of the C-terminal helix interactions among the monomers intact (those shown in Figure 4b), thus leading to the prediction that the integrity of the homotrimer is not effected.

Location of the Active Site An alignment of RS sequences from 15 species indicates that 22 residues are strictly conserved (Figure 3d, see

Supplementary Material for the alignment of RS from 15 species). Seven of the conserved residues are glycines that serve structural requirements. The two conserved leucines (Leu47 and Leu147) have their side chains directed toward the hydrophobic core region within the same monomer and likely serve packing requirements. The side chains of Glu85, Thr165, and Asn181 are similarly directed toward the interior of the same monomer and form hydrogen bonds with backbone amides. The side chains of the remaining 10 conserved residues are directed toward the solvent and the neighboring monomer. The single tight intermolecular interface in the asymmetrical trimer (between molecules A and C) is populated by 14 of the conserved, nonglycine residues from both monomers: five of them (Met1, His97, Ser146, Thr148, and Asp185) come from molecule A, and nine of them (Met1, Phe2, Ser41, Cys48, His97, His102, Ser146, Glu183, and Asp185) come from molecule C (Figure 5a). This interface constitutes the putative active site.

The nature of the conserved side chains in the putative active site lends support for the active site location. As mentioned above, an active site residue may serve as a nucleophile in forming an additional product to the pteridine ring of the butane-donor DMRL molecule to initiate the catalytic cycle (Figure 1). Attractive candidates for this role are the side chains of Ser146 in molecules A and C. In both cases, the hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the imidazole of His97 of the same molecule. Flipping the side chain of Asp185 of the same molecule allows its carboxyl group to share a hydrogen bond with the imidazole of His97, thus completing the presumed proton donation progression: Ser146His97 Asp185 (Figure 5b). Also, the carboxylate of the conserved Glu183 (molecule A) is hydrogen bonded through a water molecule to the imidazole of His97 (molecule A). Two other candidates for serving as the enzyme nucleophile are the hydroxyl of the conserved Ser41 and the thiol of the conserved Cys48, both from molecule

C. The hydroxyl and the thiol of the 2 residues are within hydrogen bonding distance (the OG to SG distance is ° 3.5 A), and each could stabilize the other for deprotonation. The yeast RS is known to be inactivated by thiolmodification reagents [7], and we find that the E. coli RS is inactivated by the reagent examined (5,5 -dithiobis[2nitrobenzoic acid]). Since Cys48 is the only Cys residue that is conserved between the yeast and E. coli proteins, it is likely the one modified. Also, the thiol group of Cys48 of E. coli RS has the greatest exposure to the solvent among the three Cys residues of RS for reacting with the modification reagent; the solvent-exposed surface areas for the SG atoms of Cys48, Cys47, and ° Cys158 are 23, 14, and 1 A2, respectively. Yet another potential nucleophile is the side chain of Thr148 (molecule A), whose hydroxyl is hydrogen bonded to the imidazole of His102 (molecule C). With the expectation that catalysis would not commence in the absence of a fully

formed active site, Thr148 becomes a favored candidate for serving as the nucleophile because activation of its hydroxyl group occurs only when an active site is formed (e.g., the interface between molecules A and C). Among the conserved residues discussed above, there are several that could alternatively function as a general acid/ base in the catalytic cycle. Replacement of the conserved Phe2 with Ala results in a catalytically inactive E. coli RS (kcat of the mutant 10 4 that of wild-type, unpublished data). Phe2 (molecule C) may have a role in stabilizing the position of the thiol group of Cys48 of the same molecule; the distance ° between the CE1 of Phe2 and the SG of Cys48 is 3.8 A. The conserved Met1 from molecules A and C have their ° side chains directed toward the interface about 11 A apart from one another and exposed to solvent. The conserved Met1 (molecule C) may play a role in stabilizing the position of the side chain of His97 (molecule A);

Several hydrophobic interactions and one salt bridge are shown including residues: molecule A (Val191, Val195, Glu196, and Leu199), molecule B (Val195, Val198, and Leu199), and molecule C (Val191, Val192, Val195, Arg197, and Leu199). (c) An overlay of the three monomers of the RS trimer. Only the N barrels from the monomers are used for the structure alignment. Molecule A is colored in yellow, molecule B is colored in cyan, and molecule C is colored in magenta. Small degrees of domain variation among the monomers are evident. The two monomers that share a tight intermolecular interface (molecules A and C) have a smaller rmsd for C atoms ° ° ° (0.88 A) between them than do molecules A and B (1.43 A) or molecules B and C (1.08 A). The degrees of similarity also vary for the individual folding domains between the monomers. Separate alignments of the N barrel, C barrel, and the C-terminal helix give rmsd for the C atoms ° ° ° of 0.69 A, 0.61 A, and 0.63 A, respectively, for the residues used in the alignments of molecules A and C. For molecules A and B, the respective ° ° ° ° ° ° values are 0.86 A, 0.78 A, and 0.67 A; and for molecules B and C, the respective values are 0.95 A, 0.51 A, and 0.65 A.

the distance between the SD of Met1 and the CB of ° His97 is 4.3 A. Whereas the above analysis focuses on the putative active site that is formed at the interface between molecules A and C, there are two analogous active sites that could be formed between molecules A and B and between molecules B and C. The nature of the association of the monomers within the trimer dictates that only one active site can be formed at a time. However, the

two unformed active sites and the one formed active site must be fully capable of binding fluorinated DMRL analogs in order to explain the binding stoichiometries that have been determined (three or six analog molecules per trimer, depending on whether the butanedonor, butane-acceptor, or both sites are occupied) [6, 8, 9]. Indeed, few of the conserved residues at the interface between molecules A and C interact with residues from the other molecule, and presumably they

need not do so for binding substrates and analogs. So, whether the active site residues are widely separated (as in the two between molecules A and B and molecules B and C) or close together and formed (as in the one between molecules A and C), they can bind substrates, but only the formed active site would be capable of catalysis. In a general sense, the different binding environments for the binding sites determined by NMR for the fluorinated DMRL analogs are consistent with the different active sites found in the structure. In order to form a new active site, the one between molecules A and C must be broken. Reorientation of the three molecules to form a new active site (e.g., between molecules A and B) could be assisted by having the flexible joint in the bundle of C-terminal helices that comprises several hydrophobic contacts between residues (Figure 4b). Structural Comparisons A VAST [23] search for proteins with folds similar to those of RS found six proteins that contain a barrel that is strikingly similar to the barrels of RS, according to the small rms differences of the C atoms that match those of the C and N barrels of RS (molecule A): phthalate dioxygenase reductase (PDB code 2PIA; rmsd for 63

° C atoms of the N barrel 1.3 A, rmsd for 61 C atoms of ° the C barrel 1.4 A) [24], NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase (PDB code 1QFJ; rmsd for 68 C atoms of the N barrel ° ° 1.7 A, rmsd for 63 C atoms of the C barrel 1.6 A) [25], ferredoxin:NADP reductase from Anabaena Pcc (PDB code 1QUE; rmsd for 68 C atoms of the N barrel ° ° 1.5 A, rmsd for 66 C atoms of the C barrel 1.3 A) [26], ferredoxin:NADP reductase from Azotobacter vinelandii (PDB code 1A8P; rmsd for 65 C atoms of ° the N barrel 1.3 A, rmsd for 61 C atoms of the C ° barrel 1.4 A) [27], cytochrome B5 reductase (PDB code 1NDH; rmsd for 56 C atoms of the N barrel ° ° 1.6 A, rmsd for 58 C atoms of the C barrel 1.6 A) [28], and F1-ATPase (PDB code 1SKY; rmsd for 54 C ° atoms of the N barrel 1.8 A, rmsd for 52 C atoms of ° the C barrel 1.7 A) [29]. Connectivities were confirmed to be identical by visual inspection of the aligned models. An overlay of the barrel of phthalate dioxygenase reductase with the N barrel of RS illustrates the similarity of the folds (Figure 6a). The protein sequences in the overlay are less than 15% identical (see Supplementary Material for sequence alignments). The proteins having PDB codes 2PIA, 1QUE, 1A8P, and 1NDH are flavoproteins with their flavin cofactors

in the models. An overlay of the barrels of the four proteins shows that the riboflavin portion of the flavin cofactors occupy similar space (the corresponding atom ° positions are within 0.5 A of one another). An overlay of the 2PIA barrel onto the six barrels of the RS trimer allows positioning of the FMN cofactor of 2PIA onto the structure of RS. For visualization purposes, the overlay positions of four FMN cofactors on molecules A and C of RS are depicted (Figure 6b). Notably, this models the flavins in the region of the active sites that were predicted on the basis of RS residues that were conserved

among species. The model has only one formed active site with the two flavins juxtaposed; the other flavins are well separated. Trimming butanyl and phosphoryl units from the FMN cofactors yields DMRL (the substrate for RS) and a modeled view of substrates bound to RS. A Model of Substrates in the Active Site The resulting model of DMRL substrates in the closed active site that exists at the interface of molecules A and C provides numerous insights that are relevant to enzyme function (Figure 6c). First, the DMRL molecule

Structure 406

associated with molecule A (C barrel) is mainly surrounded by protein residues from molecule A; e.g., ° within 3.5 A of the DMRL molecule there are 8 residues from molecule A (Ile5, Ser146, Thr148, His160, Leu161, Ile162, Thr165, and Arg168) and 1 from molecule C (His102). Likewise, the DMRL molecule associated with molecule C (N barrel) is mainly surrounded by protein ° residues from molecule C; within 3.5 A of the DMRL molecule there are 8 residues from molecule C (Cys48, Thr50, Asp62, Leu63, Met64, Glu66, Thr67, and Ile70) and 2 from molecule A (Thr148 and Ile162). The binding contacts between a DMRL molecule and the protein that appear to arise primarily from a single subunit suggest independent binding modes for DMRL molecules to the trimeric RS, which is consistent with the linear Lineweaver Burk plots with substrate DMRL and the linear Scatchard plots with DMRL analogs [6, 9, 10]. Secondly, the two DMRL molecules are oriented at about 180 with respect to each other, with the ribityl chains pointed in opposite directions; this is in accord with a prediction that accounts for the regiospecificity of the enzymecatalyzed reaction [19]. Also, in the model, the exocyclic methyl groups of the DMRL molecule in molecule C are directed toward the DMRL heterocycle of molecule A, as if poised for attack. This would assign the DMRL of molecule C (N barrel) as the butane-acceptor and the DMRL of molecule A (C barrel) as the butane-donor. The model lacks a clear suggestion as to the identity of a potential nucleophile that would add to the donor DMRL, ° as depicted in Figure 1. Within 3.5 A of the receiving carbon atom there is only one potential nucleophile, the C2 hydroxyl of the ribityl chain of the same DMRL molecule. The activated hydroxyl of Thr148 is distal to the receiving carbon atom and closer to the adjacent ring carbon atom of DMRL instead. Perhaps the nucleophile of Figure 1 is a water molecule on the enzyme, as is the case in the noncatalyzed reaction. Although, the model of DMRL molecules in the RS active site has some appealing features and lacks overwhelming steric conflicts, the model originated from rather indirect means, and direct experimental results are required to define the true binding mode.

the unoccupied active sites of DMRL synthase could serve to relieve product inhibition of RS activity; the RS product RAADP (Figure 1) is a substrate for DMRL synthase, and riboflavin binds to DMRL synthase. In this scenario, the E. coli RS once had an association with DMRL synthase that has since been lost. Three-dimensional structures have now been determined for three enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, with RS joining DMRL synthase [15­18] and 3,4-Dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate synthase [32]. Even though the active site of RS is not fully defined by this work, the structure will likely lead the way to determinations of structures of the enzyme complexed with active site ligands that provide further definition. With time, there will be sufficient structural and biochemical information to formulate a detailed mechanism for catalysis. Further work can explain the structural and functional relationships of the homotrimer of RS within the 60-mer capsid of DMRL synthase that occurs among certain species [14, 30]. Applied efforts may use the structural information for the design of new catalysts that have altered substrate specificities and inhibitors of RS function in pathogens (human, animal, and crop) and weeds. Our observation that only one active site of the trimer may be formed at a time predicts that a tight binding inhibitor could shut down the activity of all three active sites by occupying the two DMRL binding sites of a single (formed) active site. Indeed, initial attempts to link the DMRL butane-donor and DMRL butaneacceptor binding sites of RS with a single inhibitor molecule are reported [10].
Experimental Procedures Proteins and Crystallization Native E. coli RS was overproduced in E. coli and purified as described [33, 34]. Se-Met-labeled E. coli RS was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)(met ) bearing the expression vector using a defined growth medium including L-Se-Met [35]. The F2A mutant of RS was prepared using two primers: 5 -ACT CAT TTA cca tgg CTA CGG GGA TTG TAC AGG GC-3 introduces an NcoI site at the initiation codon and changes the second amino acid from Phe to Ala, and 5 -ATC TTA CTg tcg acT TCA GGC TTC TGT GCC TGG TT-3 hybridizes at the other end of the gene and introduces a SalI site right after the stop codon. There were no other changes in the sequence, as confirmed by DNA sequencing. The PCR reaction, ligation into the plasmid, and production of the mutant protein in E. coli were the same as for the native RS [34]. Purification of the Se-Met-labeled RS and the F2A mutant RS was in similar fashion to that of the native E. coli RS [33, 34]. Crystallization was at 22 C (the one temperature examined) from sitting drops by mixing equal volumes (2 l) of the protein solution (14 mg/ml native or Se-Met-labeled RS in 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]) and the well solution (7%­10% diglyme in 25 mM 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane-NaOH, 20­50 mM MgCl2 [pH 7.0]). Crystals grew to 1.0 0.3 0.15 mm within 5 hr. Additional details on the crystallization and the crystals are available [34]. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement Data were collected at the DND CAT of the Advanced Photon Source using a 135 mm MAR CCD camera. Crystals were frozen and maintained at 180 C in the cold stream. A five-wavelength MAD data set was collected using an inverted beam geometry at wavelengths selected on the basis of an Se fluorescence scan. Data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK [36]. The structure was solved by using the MAD method [35]. The positions of the 21 Se atoms were obtained by Bijvoet difference direct methods (SHELX97) [37]. The phasing was solved using SHARP [38]. The resulting phases were

Biological Implications Why has an enzyme been selected for that has two thirds of its catalytic machinery unengaged at any one time? A speculation is that RS owes its state to its association with the 60-mer icosahedral capsid of DMRL synthase, as occurs in the case of the B. subtilis heavy RS. The association of RS and DMRL synthase of B. subtilis is reported to enhance catalytic efficiency through a mechanism of substrate channeling [30]. On an enzyme protomer basis, the kcat at pH 7.0 and 25 C for the E. coli RS (0.30 s 1) is about 10-fold that of the E. coli DMRL synthase (0.024 s 1) [31]. The kcat for DMRL synthase can be strongly limited by product (DMRL) release [31], and product inhibition could be relieved by having the active sites of RS in close proximity and available to bind the product. In this role, the active sites of RS would not be required to catalyze the conversion of DMRL to riboflavin, but simply to bind DMRL. Also,

used to generate an initial map, which was sharpened by using a solvent-flattening program [39]. This map showed clearly that the three molecules in the asymmetric unit do not have three-fold symmetry. The model for each monomer was built independently by using the program O [40]. The higher resolution, native data set was used to refine the native enzyme structure. One cycle of rigid-body refinement against native data was done on the initial model, which was built based on the Se-Met data, before further refinement using the program TNT [41]. A total of nine cycles of refinement was carried out. A portion (10%) of the data was left out of the refinement for the first six cycles, and 5% of the data was left out for the last three cycles. Using these reflections, Rfree was calculated at each step of the refinement to avoid over-fitting the data. Each cycle of refinement consists of one round of least-square refinement using the program TNT [41], except for the fifth cycle, which was refined by using XPLOR [42], and manual model fixing on each monomer. Individual B factors were refined with restraints. At the second cycle of refinement, the highest 300 peaks in the difference Fourier map were examined, and 101 water molecules were incorporated into the model. The highest 100 peaks in the difference Fourier map were examined at each of the subsequent refinement cycles, and a water molecule was added if it formed one or more hydrogen bonds to the neighboring atoms. Incorporating the NCS restraint in the refinement, such that the rms ° differences between pairs of the monomers became less than 1 A for all atoms, resulted in a dramatic increase in both Rfree ( 3%) and Rwork ( 5%). This indicated that there are real differences in the structures, especially for the side chain atoms, among the three monomers. In addition, the degrees of similarity for the main chain conformations among the three monomers vary (see legend of Figure 4). Therefore, NCS restraint was not used in the refinement. The final model contains 592 residues (out of 639 total) and 229 water molecules with an Rwork of 23.9% and an Rfree 6% higher than that (Table 2). Of the residues not in the models, residues 207­213 of molecules A and B and residues 202­213 of molecule C are in the C terminus; residues 114­118 of molecule B constitute 3 residues of strand 1 and 2 residues in the loop connecting 1 to 2 in the C barrel, residues 91­96 of molecule C are in the loop connecting the N and C barrels, and residues 111­120 of molecule C are part of strands 1 and 2 in the C barrel. None of the main chain - angles of nonglycine residues in the final model are in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot (see Supplementary Material). The aver° age B value for 592 main chain residues is 39.3 A2, with an rms ° difference of 2.5 A2. The average B value for 508 side chain residues ° ° is 50.2 A2, with a rms difference of 6.6 A2. The average B values for ° ° the main chains of molecules A, B, and C are 35.1 A2, 44.4 A2, and ° ° 38.6 A2, respectively, with corresponding rms differences of 2.4 A2, ° ° 2.6 A2, and 2.6 A2. The average B values for the side chains of ° ° ° molecules A, B, and C are 46.1 A2, 56.1A2, and 48.3 A2, respectively, ° ° ° with corresponding rms differences of 6.7 A2, 6.8 A2, and 6.2 A2. The ° average B value for the water molecules is 49.8 A2. Figures Figures 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b, and 6c were generated using RIBBONS [43].
