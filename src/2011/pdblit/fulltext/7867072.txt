In Bacillus subtilis, the termination of DNA replication via polar fork arrest is effected by a specific protein:DNA complex formed between the replication terminator protein (RTP) and DNA terminator sites. We report the crystal structure of a replication terminator protein homologue (RTP.C110S) of B. subtilis in complex with the high affinity component of one of its cognate DNA termination sites, known as the TerI B-site, refined at 2.5 Å resolution. The 21 bp RTP:DNA complex displays marked structural asymmetry in both the homodimeric protein and the DNA. This is in contrast to the previously reported complex formed with a symmetrical TerI B-site homologue. The induced asymmetry is consistent with the complex's solution properties as determined using NMR spectroscopy. Concomitant with this asymmetry is variation in the protein:DNA binding pattern for each of the subunits of the RTP homodimer. It is proposed that the asymmetric "wing" positions, as well as other asymmetrical features of the RTP:DNA complex, are critical for the cooperative binding that underlies the mechanism of polar fork arrest at the complete terminator site.

The target Ter sites of RTP are 30 bp sequences comprising two imperfect inverted 16 bp repeats named the A site and B site that overlap at a highly conserved trinucleotide sequence.2 The A site and B sites each bind one dimer of RTP. The RTP-Ter complex is capable of arresting replication fork progression only when orientated such that the B site is proximal to the approaching replication fork.3 Whilst the two RTP molecules that comprise the complete RTP-Ter complex may be structurally symmetrical their binding to the A and B sites is not equivalent. Indeed, binding to the A site alone does not occur without prior filling of the B site through an as yet poorly understood cooperative binding interaction.4 Furthermore, binding to the B site alone is not sufficient to halt the advancing helicase.5,6 It is only when both A and B sites are filled (KD = 3 × 10-11 M) that fork arrest occurs.7 The classic winged-helix motif is a compact / structure with  topology where "wings" project from the loop between 2-3 strands and sometimes also following 3.8 RTP conforms to this definition except that each subunit lacks a well formed 1-strand (referred to here as the 1loop) and it possesses an additional long 4-helix

Introduction
The final phase of DNA replication in Bacillus subtilis begins with the arrest of clockwise and anticlockwise replication forks at a distinct region of its circular chromosome known as the terminus region. This region is bounded by DNA motifs, known as Terminator (Ter) sites, to which two copies of the homodimeric replication terminator protein (RTP) bind. The 2:1 complex of RTP (i.e. two dimers) and DNA (the Ter site) is able to effect the arrest of replication forks by impeding the progression of the replicative machinery headed by the replicative helicase. Importantly, the action of the Ter complex is polar in nature; that is, it allows the replication fork to pass unimpeded if it approaches from the "permissive" direction yet halts its approach from the other "blocking" direction.1 Nine terminator sites (Ter sites) are arranged that allow replication forks to pass into the terminus region of the chromosome but not to leave.1 This forms a "repliAbbreviations used: RTP, replication terminator protein; RMSD, root mean square deviation; ds, double-stranded; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence.

482 following the 3-strand. This extra helix serves as a dimerisation interface, forming an antiparallel coiled coil with its 4-helix counterpart from the other subunit. The 3-helix or recognition helix of the winged-helix motif is responsible for specific binding to the major groove of DNA. The wings of most winged helix proteins are associated with providing additional protein:DNA contacts through binding the phosphate backbone of the minor groove, although they have also been implicated in protein: protein interactions.9 Biochemical analysis of RTP has suggested that the wings are involved in both protein and DNA contacts.9,10 A polar replication terminator system has also been characterised in Escherichia coli.11 The E. coli chromosome contains ten terminator sites TerA­ TerJ, each of which is an asymmetric sequence of 23 bp, that binds one monomer of Termination utilisation substance (Tus).12 Tus binds the E. coli Ter with a very high affinity, with an estimated KD for the Tus:TerB complex of 3.4 × 10-13 M.13 The crystal structure of Tus in complex with bases 4­19 of TerA revealed an asymmetric protein structure presenting two very different faces to the approaching replisome.14 It was shown that the Tus:Ter complex blocked the action of the DnaB helicase,15 through a mechanism coupled to helicase catalysed strand separation.16 It was shown that the translocation of the helicase along the DNA formed a stable locked complex at the non-permissive end of the Tus:Ter complex via the shifting of the C(6) nucleotide into a cytosine specific binding site on Tus.16 This renders the Tus:Ter complex a polar non-specific block to helicase translocation along the DNA. Early expectations were that the mechanism of the B. subtilis terminator complex would be similar to that of its E. coli counterpart. However, relating the mechanisms of the two systems is complicated, as they share no similarity in sequence or structure. Further, when the crystal structure of apoRTP was determined17 it revealed that RTP is a symmetric homodimer. This raises the question: how does this symmetric protein produce an asymmetric function? Identifying the basis of this functional asymmetry and furthermore the mechanism by which the helicase is impeded in B. subtilis has been the focus of debate in the literature.9,18­21 It has been proposed that polarity either occurs through the differential binding affinity and cooperative binding of the RTP molecule at the A and B sites or through significant conformational changes to the RTP molecules that render the whole terminator complex asymmetric.4 Previously, we have reported the structure of an RTP.C110S mutant in complex with a symmetric RTP B site (sRB) sequence.22 This B site contains six base-pair changes compared with the native RTP B site (nRB) from TerI (the first Ter site that the clockwise replication fork encounters), rendering the sequence symmetric. The RTP:sRB interaction was shown to have a similar binding affinity, yet of note, a reduced fork arrest capability, compared to

the RTP:nRB interaction. Both NMR and crystallographic structural analysis of RTP.C110S:sRB revealed a symmetric RTP bound to symmetric DNA. Importantly, this structure revealed the orientation of RTP when bound upon DNA and suggested how two molecules of RTP could be juxtaposed when bound to a complete Ter site.22 Nevertheless, it did not reveal whether RTP bound to the nRB site would display structural asymmetry. Here we report the structure of RTP.C110S in complex with the nRB binding site. Interestingly, both the protein and the DNA are asymmetric.

Results
Overall structure of RTP:nRB We have determined the crystal structure of RTP. C110S in complex with a 21 bp, native RTP B site oligonucleotide (nRB) (see Figure 1(a)). The doublestranded (ds) DNA sequence represents the 21 bp B site of the TerI terminator.2 Of these, 19 base-pairs are visible in the electron density with the first two base-pairs at the upstream end (the end that overlaps with the A site) disordered. There is some evidence in the electron density of the possible position of the phosphate backbone and bases. However, the electron density could not be readily interpreted and this part of the complex is not included in the crystal structure. The dsDNA is positioned in the asymmetric unit so that the upstream end interacts with the downstream end of an adjacent dsDNA. This arrangement is not uncommon in crystals containing dsDNA, allowing base stacking to occur between the bases of abutted DNA molecules.23 All residues, except the first seven from the N terminus of each RTP.C110S monomer are clearly defined in the electron density. A portion of the crystal structure and electron density is shown in Figure 1(b). Crystallographic information is summarised in Table 1. The overall structure of the protein is that of a homodimeric wingedhelix similar to that first reported for apo-RTP by Bussiere et al.,17 and confirmed for RTP.C110S in both apo and dsDNA-bound forms in our own studies.22,24 Notably, while RTP.C110S formed as a symmetric dimer in our previous structural studies, in the current study RTP.C110S complexed with nRB has distinctly asymmetric features and correspondingly asymmetric contacts with the target nRB (Figure 1(a)). It is of note that the length of the nRB dsDNA is identical to that used for the study of RTP.C110S:sRB and there are only six base-pair differences between the two 21 bp sequences (Figure 1(c)). Despite this, RTP.C110S:nRB formed an asymmetric structure whilst RTP.C110S:sRB formed a virtually symmetric structure. One 2-loop--3 strand or wing is positioned downwards ("wing-down" monomer) and makes

tant with these differences are differences in the positions of the 1-loops as well as subtle differences in the positions of the 3-recognition helices. Furthermore, the dsDNA, which adopts a conformation close to B-form at the downstream end, is distorted at the upstream end with unwinding of the double helix and separation of the base-pairs occurring just prior to the disorder of the first two base-pairs. Solution properties of RTP:nRB In the process of preparing the RTP.C110S:nRB complex, 15 N- 1 H heteronuclear single quantum coherence ­(HSQC) NMR spectra were recorded as the nRB oligonucleotide was titrated into the solution containing labelled protein. This allowed the shifts of 15N-1H signals to be tracked from their unbound to their bound positions, and indicated the point at which all of the RTP.C110S was complexed. Figure 2 shows the final titration point of RTP.C110S: nRB compared with that reported previously for RTP.C110S:sRB; these are superimposed over assigned apo-RTP signals.25 Many of the correlation signals shifted to positions that were similar to that observed for RTP.C110S:sRB, reflecting the similar electronic perturbations experienced by RTP.C110S upon binding DNA. The striking difference between the spectra is the relative broadening of signals in the case of RTP.C110S:nRB and formation of some double peaks compared to those that are single in the case of RTP.C110S:sRB. This is consistent with an asymmetric binding mode in solution upon

In black is shown a previously assigned 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum recorded for apo-RTP.C110S.25 In (a) the apo-RTP.C110S spectrum is superposed on the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum performed for the RTP.C110S:nRB complex shown in blue. In (b) the apo-RTP.C110S spectrum is superposed on the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of the RTP.C110S:sRB complex shown in red. Some of the more clearly defined cross-peaks are labelled. The addition of the nRB DNA resulted in many shifts in cross-peak positions similar to those recorded upon the addition of the sRB DNA, but also caused crosspeak broadening. In several cases, where the signals are not crowded, it appears that there is peak splitting upon binding to nRB. This is consistent with the formation of a complex in which the two RTP monomers are experiencing different electronic environments as would occur in an asymmetric structure.

485 the loop connecting the 2 and 3 strands elevated approximately 14 Å from the equivalent sRB complex wing position. The wing reaches across and binds along the minor groove of symmetryrelated DNA. There are also differences between the sRB and nRB DNA structures as shown in Figure 3(d). Similarly to the sRB, the central A-T base-pairing has a large negative propeller twist angle of -22°. Downstream the nRB resembles the sRB DNA and is essentially straight B-form. There are slight distortions of the downstream terminus with a large negative slide of the second last base step and a decrease in the rise of the last base step to 2.6 Å that results in a widening of the major groove. Upstream the nRB DNA deviates significantly from straight B-form with a bend of 9.4° over the first four base steps in the direction of Atip (the angle of inclination of the base-pairs about their longitudinal axis). Furthermore, the upstream end of the nRB is underwound with helical twist values for the first three base steps of 9.6° 24.3° and 22.5°, respectively. Despite underwinding of the duplex the DNA maintains its B-form conformation with an average slide of -0.76 Å, X-displacement of -0.62 Å and inclination of -4.04°. It should be noted that at this end the DNA is disordered with the first two basepairs having no interpretable electron density. Asymmetry of RTP.C110S:nRB protein­DNA contacts The structural differences between the wing-up and wing-down monomers of RTP.C110S as well as the sequence and structural differences of the upstream and downstream ends of the nRB dsDNA are reflected in dissimilar protein:DNA interactions as summarised in Figure 4. The N terminus and start of the 1-helix of the wing-down monomer binds the nRB sequence through a series of contacts to the phosphate backbone. The hydroxyl group of Thr9 interacts with Gua14 on the lagging strand (on the upstream half of the complex). On the leading strand, the phosphate group of Gua14 is bound by Gln15 N and N2, and that of Thy13 interacts with the peptidyl amide of Arg16 and the N group of Lys14. Further contacts are made to the phosphate backbone of the lagging strand by residues on the 1-loop. The hydroxyl group of Tyr33 and the peptidyl amide of Leu35 bind the phosphate groups of Cyt3 and Thy4, respectively. In the wing-down monomer the primary contacts are made by residues emanating from the 3-helix to the downstream major groove binding site. These include non-sequence-specific contacts and all specific base contacts made to the major groove. Sugar-phosphate backbone contacts are made to Gua14 on the leading strand by the N2 of Asn53 and to the lagging strand bases Thy4 and Gua5 by the hydroxyl group of Tyr58 and N2 of His62, respectively. Specific contacts are made to three nucleosides in the major groove, including those between His54 (N2) and Gua5 (O6), Thr55 (C2,

binding to nRB, in which specific signals arising from the two monomers no longer occur at superimposing chemical shifts. Although assignments for the complexed-RTP are not available, it appears that these occur not only for residues making contact with the asymmetric base-pairs (that would be expected to experience different electronic environments), but also for residues at the ends of the wings such as Gly79. This suggests that the asymmetric structure of RTP.C110S.nRB captured in the current crystal packing arrangement, reflects a true intrinsic asymmetry of the complex. Comparison of RTP.C110S:nRB and RTP.C110S:sRB structures The difference between the RTP.C110S:nRB and RTP.C110S:sRB protein structures is illustrated in Figure 3(a). The deviation of the C atom positions of the wing-up and wing-down monomers compared with each other and with superimposed sRB bound RTP.C110S monomers is shown plotted against residue number in Figure 3(b). The wingdown monomer closely resembles the conformation of RTP.C110S in the previously solved crystal structure of the RTP.C110S:sRB complex, superposing with an RMSD of 0.57 Å over all C atoms (excluding the wings, residues 72 to 88). The flexible N termini do not overlay and there is a deviation in the position of the 1-loop that makes contact with the DNA in both structures via Tyr33 (Figure 3(c)). The angle between the 2-helix and the 3-helix is preserved at 129°, as is the angle at which the recognition helix binds the major groove (Figure 3(a)). Significant differences also occur at the end of the wing (or loop connecting the 2 and 3-strands), a region that has been shown in previous crystal structures to be inherently flexible,17,24 and in this structure involved at a crystal contact interface. In contrast, the wing-up conformation differs from the RTP.C110S:sRB structure, superposing with an RMSD of 1.4 Å over all C atoms (excluding residues 72 to 88). Similarly, the DNA is distorted with an RMSD across the phosphate groups on this end of the DNA of 2.5 Å (comparatively, the RMSD of the phosphate groups on the wing-down end of the complex was 1.9 Å). The N terminus again deviates relative to that in the RTP.C110S:sRB structure. Most strikingly, the 1-loop of the wingup monomer is repositioned and no longer makes contact with the DNA via Tyr33. Its position is oriented similarly to that found in the apo-RTP structure (Figure 3(c)).17 The 2 and 3-helices also deviate from their previously defined positions with an angle of 124° between them (Figure 3(a)). Residues on the 3-helix have moved significantly relative to the RTP.C110S:sRB complex structure to accommodate coincident distortions of the DNA. Notably, the ends of the side-chain positions of His54 and Thr55 have shifted an average of 1.9 Å and 2.4 Å respectively, yet maintain contact with the major groove. The wing is significantly raised with

strand) bind the phosphate groups of Gua5 and Thy4, respectively. In addition, the O1 atom of Gln83 interacts with the ribose of Cyt3. In the wing-up conformation the contacts to the DNA by the N-terminal residues Thr9 and Lys14 are absent. The first contact originates from Gln15

that binds the phosphate group of Gua14 directly through its N2 atom and indirectly through a bridging water molecule. The side-chain atoms N and N2 of Arg16 bind the phosphate backbone of Gua13 on the lagging strand and stabilise the large helical twist of 59° for the Thy12/Gua13 base step. In the wing-up conformation the 1-loop is reoriented with the side-chain of Tyr33 having shifted 9 Å so that it makes no interactions with the nRB. However, residues further along the 1-loop interact with the dsDNA. The ribose ring of Ade3 makes non-bonded contacts with the aliphatic chain of Lys36. Furthermore, the main chain of Leu35 forms a water-mediated interaction with the phosphate group of Thy4 as well as binding the phosphate group of the symmetry-related nucleotide Thy20. In the wing-up conformation the 3-helix again makes the primary contacts to the dsDNA. However, owing to both structural and DNA sequence differences on this half of the molecule the nature and direction of several interactions are different from those of the wing-down recognition helix. The non-specific contacts to the phosphate backbone by Asn53 and His62 are no longer direct but are retained through interactions with well-ordered water molecules. Additionally, an extra bi-dentate interaction is formed between Glu56 and the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group of Gua13 on the lagging strand. Furthermore, the side-chain of

Tyr58 has moved 7.2 Å relative to the wing-down conformation and no longer contacts the backbone of Thy4, instead binding the phosphate group of Gua5 on the leading strand. The sequence-specific contacts between His54 and Gua5, Thr55 and Thy15 and the bi-dentate interaction between Arg59 and Gua14 are retained. However, additional contacts are made from His54 (C2 and N2) to the nucleosides of Thy4 (C5M) on the leading strand and Ade16 (N6) on the lagging strand, respectively. Furthermore, the N2 of Arg59 makes an extra interaction, binding the N7 of Gua13 on the lagging strand. This interaction, in combination with interactions to the phosphate backbone by Arg16 and Glu56, stabilises the large opening of 16° for the Cyt9/Gua13 base-pair and the roll of 6° and -6° for the Cyt8/Gua14 and Cyt9/Gua13 base steps, respectively. This has the effect of narrowing the minor groove and widening the major groove by 2 Å, respectively. The wing of the wing-up monomer retains the bond between Gln72 and the phosphate of Thy4 but it is through a bridging water molecule to an adjoining molecule. The main-chain of residues Lys81, Leu82 and the sidechain of Gln83 bind the phosphate backbone of Ade6 in the minor groove of the symmetry-related DNA. The main-chain N of Val86 and the N of Lys74 interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of Thy20 at the interface of symmetry-related molecules.

Replication Terminator Protein: TerI Complex

Discussion
RTP binds asymmetrically across the native B TerI site The dimeric RTP in complex with the nRB TerI site dsDNA comprises half a functional Terminator (Ter) complex that facilitates the cooperative binding of another RTP monomer to the adjacent A site to form a complete RTP:Ter complex. The complete complex acts as a polar barrier to trap replication fork progression. When the replicative machinery approaches the B site (non-permissive end) it is unable to pass this tightly bound RTP:DNA complex. When it approaches the A site, it is able to progress through the less tightly formed complex and then through the B site complex in this permissive direction. The polarity of the terminator complex has been previously explained on the basis of the differential binding affinity of RTP for A and B sites and their cooperative binding effects.19 However, there has been no explanation of the molecular mechanism underlying the binding cooperativity by RTP molecules. Here we observe a significant structural asymmetry within a complex formed between the RTP homologue (RTP.C110S) and an nRB dsDNA target site. The crystallographically determined RTP. C110S:nRB complex displays a wing-up conformation of the RTP monomer at the upstream end of the nRB (adjacent to the A site), and a wing-down conformation at the downstream end, similar to that previously seen for RTP.C110S bound to a sRB sequence.22 These differences are coincident with different base contacts made between RTP.C110S and the DNA at the upstream end of the B site compared with those at the downstream end. The upstream DNA is also less ordered and underwound. In addition, contacts are made between the wing of the wing-up monomer and the DNA of an adjacent symmetry-related molecule. The asymmetry is thought not to purely arise due to the crystal packing arrangement, as solution studies using NMR spectroscopy were consistent with a structural asymmetry occurring in solution. In addition, intrinsic structural asymmetry would presumably be necessary to propagate the formation of crystals in which the upstream end of the complex is packed against the downstream end of a symmetry-related molecule throughout the crystal lattice. The structural asymmetry may thus be affected by three particular base-pairs in the DNA sequence at the upstream end of the complex. There are six basepair positions that differ between the nRB and sRB sequences (Figure 1(c)). The three base-pairs at the downstream end of the nRB clearly do not impact on RTP structure, since the RTP binds to both of these in a very similar wing-down conformation. This is not surprising, as no specific contacts are made to these bases by RTP. The three base-pairs within the upstream half of the nRB sequence, however, are all positioned at the major groove of the dsDNA.

This is where the 3-recognition helix binds, and includes contacts that underlie RTP binding specificity. In particular, His54 contacts the N6 of Ade 16 and Arg 59 forms a hydrogen bond with the N7 of Gua13. These interactions are precluded from occurring at the downstream end of the RTP:nRB structure. The structural differences observed for RTP.C110S:nRB may thus be initiated through differences in the contacts made by the 3-recognition helices of each RTP monomer at the two major groove binding sites. The crystal packing arrangement of this complex also allows us to fortuitously observe an interaction between the upstream wing of the RTP and DNA beyond the complexed B site. The arrangement is concomitant with DNA unwinding and bending at the upstream end, as previously observed by Kralicek et al.,19 It may be speculated that the, as yet unexplained, mechanism of binding cooperativity with the adjacent RTP:A site is facilitated by these structural interactions. A basis for cooperative binding in the functional terminator complex Interactions between the A site and B site complexes are thought to underlie binding cooperativity of two RTP molecules to the Ter site. Previously, mutagenesis experiments had implicated the wings and 1-loop in forming the dimer­dimer interaction site of the terminator complex.9 Due to the arrangement of the wings and 1-loop in the current structure, we considered whether this arrangement might reflect their position within a full Ter complex. Previous experiments have clearly shown that differences between RTP bound to nRB and sRB impact on binding cooperativity. Work by Duggin et al.18 established that, in dissociation rate experiments with a complete TerI sequence, if the nRB site is substituted with an sRB sequence then there is an approximately fivefold reduction in the cooperative binding of the A site. And in in vivo fork arrest assays it was shown that substituting the nRB sequence with an sRB sequence resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in fork arrest. In fact, studies of a series of modified Ter sites, in which the A and B site were substituted with sRB and nRB sequences, it was found that any Ter site lacking an RTP:nRB complex at either the A or B site position resulted in a reduction in fork arrest activity.18 In light of the similar binding affinities this is consistent with there being a structural distinction of the RTP: nRB complex necessary for binding cooperativity. Work by Kralicek et al.19 has suggested that upon binding of one RTP dimer to the Ter sequence there is significant bending and underwinding of the DNA and that upon the binding of the second RTP dimer there is a further bending and underwinding of the DNA. The RTP.C110S:nRB structure shows underwinding at the upstream end and suggests that the upstream wing may be involved in making contacts with DNA at the A site that would support DNA bending. Such bending may facilitate protein:

Curiously, identical preparations resulted in either a shower of microcrystals or large single crystals that typically grew in three days to dimensions 0.6 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm. The crystals were mounted in nylon loops and passed through a solution of mother liquor plus 20% (v/v) glycerol prior to flash-cooling in a nitrogen stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected using radiation of 0.9 Å wavelength at beamline 14BMC of the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories, from a single native crystal mounted 150 mm from a Quantum 4 CCD detector. The crystal was of space group C2221, with unit cell constants a = 123.8 b = 129.8 c = 125.2 Å,  =  =  = 90° and diffracted to beyond 2.5 Å. The data were processed and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK,30 data collection statistics are given in Table 1. Structure solution and refinement The structure was determined to 2.5 Å resolution by molecular replacement with the program MOLREP31,32 using the model of RTP.C110S in complex with a symmetrical B site (RTP:sRB) as search coordinates (pdb accession code: 1F4K)22 with the residues of the wing (72 to 88) of each monomer and the DNA removed. Similarly to the RTP.C110S:sRB study, this work utilised a RTP. C110S mutant form of the protein that has been shown to maintain the high binding affinity of the wild-type protein (Kd,app=4 × 10-11 M) whilst improving the solubility properties.24 Two dimers were placed in the asymmetric unit and their presence was confirmed by visual inspection with omit maps as well as clear density visible for the DNA. All refinement was carried out with REFMAC31,33 with all data from 50 to 2.5 Å with 5% of data randomly selected for cross-validation. Rounds of refinement comprised bulk solvent correction, positional refinement and individual B-factor refinement using a maximum likelihood target function. Rounds of refinement were followed by manual building in O.34 The asymmetric unit comprises two dimers of RTP, each in complex with a molecule of dsDNA and strict NCS restraints were applied across all monomers for the initial rounds of refinement. NCS restraints were loosened in the later rounds where it became apparent that regions of the structure were conformationally different. NCS restraints were removed for the final round of refinement. There was some disorder at one end of the dsDNA, which contributed to the relatively high R-factor for the structure. It should be noted that the data were subjected to twinning analysis and found not to be twinned. For the purposes of analysis we will refer to only one of the dimers, since they are virtually identical. The final refinement statistics are summarised in Table 1. The modelled protein shows good

protein contacts between the B site and A site RTP molecules. Mutagenesis studies have implicated residues on the -3 strand of the wings and the 1 loop as crucial to cooperative binding at the A site.9 In addition, photo cross-linking studies have suggested that these residues may be involved in direct protein­protein interactions.10 When modelled, the arrangement of two RTP molecules on bent DNA could place the wings in a position to form extensive contacts with each other and with the C termini of the 3-recognition helices. Whether protein:DNA or protein:protein contacts are involved, this could lead to the mutually higher affinity of A and B site bound RTP in the complete Ter complex.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of RTP.C110S:nRB complex As in previous structural studies of RTP:DNA interactions an RTP.C110S mutant was utilised for its improved solubility and near wild-type binding properties.24 15 N-labelled protein was overexpressed and purified as described by Kralicek et al.,26 Briefly, a pET-3 vector containing RTP.C110S was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG in E. coli BL21(DE3).pLysS cells grown in minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. The protein was purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography. Cell lysate in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) was applied in batch to CM-25 Sephadex beads and RTP.C110S eluted with successive washes with 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 700 mM NaCl. The protein was further purified by FPLC using a BIORAD UNO S6 cation-exchange column equilibrated in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.7). Pure RTP.C110S eluted at approximately 500 mM NaCl via application of a linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 M NaCl in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.7). The nRB oligonucleotides (nRB-1: 5-CTA TGT ACC AAA TGT TCA GTC-3; nRB-2: 5-GAC TGA ACA TTT GGT ACA TAG-3) were purchased reverse phase HPLC purified from Alpha DNA (Quebec Canada). The complimentary strands were combined at an equimolar concentration of 250 mM in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl. The annealing mixture was heated to 95 C for 5 min and then slow cooled to 22 °C at which point it was held at 22 C for 2 h. Annealed duplex oligonucleotide was purified from single-stranded oligonucleotide by anion-exchange chromatography (using a gradient of 0 to 1.0 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) applied to a MonoQ 10/10 column (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0). NMR spectroscopy NMR spectroscopy was used to observe the formation of the 15N-labelled RTP.C110S:nRB complex. The protein and the annealed oligonucleotide were combined in approximate molar ratios of 4:1, 2:1 and 1:1 in 10 ml volumes of buffered solution such that upon concentrating each sample comprised 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 670 mM NaCl, 25 M chloramphenicol, 100 M EDTA, 5% 2 H2O and 175 M dimeric RTP.C110S. 2D HSQC spectra
