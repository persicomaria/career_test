The design, synthesis, and pharmacological characterization of a highly potent and selective glutamate GluR5 agonist is reported. (S )-2-Amino-3-((RS )-3-hydroxy-8-methyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (5) is the 8-methyl analogue of (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d ]isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid ((S )-4-AHCP, 4). Compound 5 displays an improved selectivity profile compared to 4. A versatile stereoselective synthetic route for this class of compounds is presented along with the characterization of the binding affinity of 5 to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). Functional characterization of 5 at cloned iGluRs using a calcium imaging assay and voltage-clamp recordings show a different activation of GluR5 compared to (S )glutamic acid (Glu), kainic acid (KA, 1), and (S )-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid ((S )-ATPA, 3) as previously demonstrated for 4. An X-ray crystallographic analysis of 4 and computational analyses of 4 and 5 bound to the GluR5 agonist binding domain (ABD) are presented, including a watermap analysis, which suggests that water molecules in the agonist binding site are important selectivity determinants.

Introduction Glutamic acid (Glu ) is the primary central excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a key role in normal functions of the central nervous system (CNS) but also in a number of CNS disorders.1-4 Upon synaptic release, Glu activates a highly heterogeneous group of receptors comprising both the G-protein coupled metabotropic Glu receptors (mGluRs) as well as the ionotropic Glu receptors (iGluRs) that are ligand-gated ion channels.1,5 On the basis of structural, functional, and pharmacological characteristics, iGluRs are categorized into three classes according to selective activation by the agonists N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), (S)2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid ((S)-AMPA, 2), and kainic acid (KA, 1) (Figure 1). The iGluRs are homo- or heteromeric assemblies of subunits forming ion channels, AMPA receptors being made up of the GluR1-4 subunits, NMDA receptors of NR1, NR2A-D,

and NR3A-B, and KA receptors of GluR5-7 and KA1-2 subunits.1,6-8 In recent years, X-ray crystallographic studies of a soluble construct (GluR2-S1S2) of the agonist binding domain (ABD) of GluR2 containing various AMPA receptor ligands have provided structural information about ligand recognition as well as activation and desensitization mechanisms.9-11 Recently, ABDs of NR1, NR2A, NR3A-B, GluR3GluR6, and the 2 receptor have appeared.12-21 The ABD has a clamshell-like structure that closes upon ligand binding. This motion probably leads to opening of the ion channel. It has been observed that the degree of domain closure induced by ligands in GluR2 correlates with the relative agonist efficacy of ligands measured by the magnitude of the induced ion current.22,23 These constructs crystallize as dimers, and it is now generally believed that the iGluR complexes are dimers of dimer assemblies containing a total of four ligand binding sites. We recently reported that (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-7,8dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid ((S)4-AHCP, 4) is a potent and selective agonist at homomeric GluR5 receptors.24 This finding explained the paradoxically high potency in the activation of cat spinal interneurons but relatively low affinity to known Glu binding sites previously observed.25 The X-ray crystal structure of 4 in the GluR2S1S2 construct was recently reported and in this structure the ABD is partially closed, which is in agreement with previous observations that 4 is a partial agonist at GluR2.26 However, at GluR5, 4 shows superagonistic characteristics by inducing a larger current than the full agonists KA and Glu, in

voltage-clamp measurements using Xenopus laevis oocytes and from measurements of intracellular calcium concentrations in HEK293 cells,24 when these systems are expressing GluR5(Q) and treated with Concanavalin A (ConA) to block desensitization. Thus, 4 is an important tool for studying the functional properties of GluR5 and other KA receptor subtypes because it displays a different pharmacology compared to other GluR5 ligands. Two synthetic routes to 4 have been reported of which one is stereoselective, but the yields are rather low. Thus, a more efficient route to 4 and analogues is desirable. Furthermore, 4 also has significant AMPA receptor activity. We here present a preparative synthetic route to 4, and the analogue (S)-2-amino-3-((RS)-3-hydroxy-8-methyl-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-4-yl)proionic acid (5) with improved pharmacological properties, together with an X-ray crystal structure of 4 in the soluble construct of the GluR5 ABD. The interactions of 4 and 5 with the AMPA and KA receptor subtypes GluR2 and GluR5, respectively, are compared using computational binding site analysis methods including the recently reported watermap analysis. Results Chemistry. The new synthetic route to 4 (Scheme 1) commenced like previously reported syntheses from O-alkyl ketone 9a,24,25 which was prepared from ethyl 2-oxoheptanecarboxylate 6a in three steps via 7a and 8a. Similarly, the methylated analogue 9b could be synthesized from ethyl (RS)-3-methyl-2-oxoheptanecarboxylate 6b27 via 7b and 8b. Treatment of ketones 9a and 9b with hydrazine gave the hydrazones 10a and 10b in 97% and 89% yield, respectively. Subsequently, treatment with iodine yielded vinyl iodides 11a and 11b, in 83% and 53% yield, respectively, and these iodides were substrates in Negishi couplings. Thus, the (S)-serine derived iodide 12 was converted to the zinc iodide 13,28 which was used directly in Pd-catalyzed crosscoupling reactions with vinyl iodides 11a and 11b, furnishing 14a and 14b in 38% and 55% yield, respectively. Deprotection of 14a upon treatment with 6 M HCl in AcOH for 4 h at 120 °C yielded 4 in 89% yield with 87% ee. Similarly, compound 5 was obtained in 86% yield with 86% ee from 14b. Recrystallizations improved the enantiomeric excess to >95%. Attempts to separate the two diasteromers of 5 were not successful by either crystallization or HPLC. In an attempt to synthesize the chain homologue of 4, the aspartic acid derived iodide 1529 was converted to the zinc iodide 16 that was employed in a cross-coupling reaction with vinyl

iodide 11a, providing the protected homologue 17 in 57% yield. However, deprotection attempts under various acidic conditions yielded complex mixtures from which we were unable to isolate the desired final product. We also investigated the possibility of making six-membered ring homologues of 4 and 5 using the same synthetic strategy (Scheme 2). Thus, ketones 21a and 21b were obtained in three steps from 18a and 18b via isoxazolols 19a and 19b and the O-alkylated 20a and 20b, respectively. These ketones were converted into hydrazones 22a and 22b in 99% and 89% yield, respectively, that upon treatment with iodine yielded vinyl iodides 23a and 23b in 63% and 53% yield,

respectively. The vinyl iodides 23a and 23b were employed in a Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling with zinc iodide 13 providing the protected ring homologues 24a and 24b in 52% and 55% yield, respectively. Again, deprotection of these protected amino acids under acidic conditions yielded complex mixtures and we did not obtain the desired final products.

Pharmacology. The affinity of compound 5 for native AMPA, KA, and NMDA receptors was initially determined

in [3H]AMPA, [3H]KA, and [3H]CGP 39653 competition radioligand displacement assays, respectively, using cell membranes prepared from rat cortical brain tissue (Table 1). The affinity of 5 for AMPA binding sites is more than an order of magnitude lower than that of 4 and 5-fold weaker than that of (S )-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid ((S )-ATPA, 3). Also, the affinity of 5 for KA binding sites is reduced 5-fold compared to 4, although it is still 3-fold more potent than 3. The affinities of compounds 4 and 5 were further evaluated at recombinant GluR1-7 expressed as homomeric receptors in Sf9 cells (Table 2). In this assay, compounds 4 and 5 are virtually equipotent at GluR5, but at all other subtypes, compound 5 displays approximately an order of magnitude lower affinity than compound 4. Compound 5 was further characterized functionally using HEK293 cell lines stably expressing homomeric GluR1-6 by measuring the increase of intracellular Ca2ş upon iGluR activation using Fluo-4/AM as a fluorescent Ca2ş indicator (Table 3).30 In this assay, compound 5 exhibit reduced agonist potencies at GluR1-4 AMPA receptors compared to 4, whereas the potency at iGluR5 is maintained. No response at GluR6 is observed for 4 or 5 at concentrations up to 1 mM. Thus, compound 5 more selectively activates GluR5 than 4. As for 1 and 4, compound 5 is a partial agonist at AMPA receptors in this assay, whereas 3 is a full agonist. As observed previously for 4, the response induced by 5 at ConA treated GluR5 is greater than those elicited by Glu, 1, and 3. To further establish the functional characteristics of 5 seen in the Fluo-4/AM assay, we performed functional characterization using voltage-clamp measurements at oocytes expressing GluR1 and GluR5 (Table 4, Figure 2). Again, 5 is more selective as compared to previously reported data for 3 and 4.24,31 X-ray Crystal Structure. The soluble GluR5-S1S2 construct comprising the agonist binding domain of the receptor16 was cocrystallized with 4 in order to acquire detailed knowledge on the binding mode of 4 in GluR5 (Figure 3A). The protein crystallized in space group P41212, with two molecules forming a dimer in the asymmetric unit and ° reflections extended to 2.2 A resolution (Table 5). Investigation of the ligand-binding cavity reveals that the ligand is bound with the R-amino acid part of the molecule anchored primarily by charge-charge interactions to Arg523 and Glu738 in a manner very similar to that observed in other structures of the ABD of iGluRs and with additional hydrogen bonds to backbone as well as side chain atoms of the protein (Table 6 and Figure 3B). In the distal part of the ligand, the exocyclic oxygen and the nitrogen atom of the isoxazole ring act as a mimic of the -carboxylate moiety of

Glu when compared to the structure of GluR5-S1S2 complexed with Glu (Figure 3C).16 Introduction of the sevenmembered ring has two consequences: (1) Four water molecules (W3, W5, W6, and W7, Figure 3C) participating in a hydrogen-bond network between the protein and the endogenous ligand Glu are displaced by the ring, which thereby almost entirely fills this subcavity of the protein. (2) The ring acts as a spacer that keeps the ABD in a partially open conformation (9-11° more open as compared to GluR5 in complex with Glu, PDB code 1YCJ16). In the structure of GluR2-S1S2 in complex with 4, the ligand was found in two conformations caused by a ring flip in the seven-membered ring (Figure 3D).26 In the GluR5S1S2 structure, the majority of the electron density can be explained by a single conformation of 4. Molecular Modeling. Docking and Design. When 4 was first docked to GluR2 and a homology model of GluR524 and compared with the GluR5-selective ligand (S )-2-amino3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisothiazol-4-yl)propionic acid (3a) (PDB: 2AIX), docking scores and structural analysis indicated that GluR5 probably accommodates a methyl substituent at position 8 better than GluR2. In particular, Ser721 and Ser741 in GluR5 (Thr686 and Met708 in GluR2) were hypothesized to provide extra space for or clash with the substituent, respectively. Solving the experimental structures of 4 in complex with GluR2-S1S2 (PDB: 1WVJ)26 and GluR5-S1S2 (PDB: YYYY; present study) supports this idea, and accordingly, analogue 5 was synthesized, expecting that introduction of a methyl group at position 8 would increase potency at GluR5 and decrease potency at GluR2, thus improving GluR5 versus GluR2 selectivity. Conformational Preferences of 4 and 5. In principle, the seven-membered rings of 4 and of the diastereomers (2S,8R)5 and (2S,8S)-5 can assume four puckering modes, depending on whether the carbon atom in position 7 is in or out of the isoxazole plane and whether position 6 is located above or below

the plane of the ring system (that is, on the same side of or opposite to the R-amino acid side chain). Density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations in water indicate that for 4, two of these conformations are more favorable: those with the position 6 carbon atom opposite to the side chain. The same two conformations were observed in the structure of GluR2-S1S2:4 (PDB: 1WVJ).26 The conformation observed in GluR5-S1S2 is 1.0 (DFT) or 0.4 kcal/mol (ab initio) higher in energy than the global minimum. Examination in GluR5 of the electron density around the seven-membered ring, with re-refinement using alternative conformations, suggests that the bound structure is mostly in this higher-energy conformation,

but some contribution from the alternative low-energy ring puckering seen in GluR2 cannot be ruled out. The reason for the slightly higher energy ring conformation with the carbon atom in position 7 out of the isoxazole plane in GluR5 is avoidance of close approach to the -hydroxyl group of Ser741, whereas the -methylene of Met708 in GluR2 is further away. For 5, the conformational distribution is further affected by the preference of the 8-methyl substituent to rotate out of the isoxazole plane, disfavoring one of the conformations of each diastereomer and in particular the ring conformation of (2S,8R)-5 corresponding to 4 in GluR5 is higher in energy. Two low energy conformations of (2S,8R)-5 and (2S,8S)-5 are presented in Figure 4.

Watermap Analysis. A watermap analysis was performed in order to establish whether selectivity can be understood in terms of the pattern and energies of water molecules in the binding pocket. Watermap is a binding site analysis tool based on inhomogeneous solvation theory, capable of describing the entropic and enthalpic contributions to the free energies of individual receptor hydration sites, by clustering the results from an explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation.32,33 Using the proteins only from GluR2S1S2:4 (PDB: 1WVJ)26 and from GluR5-S1S2:4 (molB), a pair of MD simulations were run and analyzed, leading to the watermaps shown in Figure 5. The agreement between the watermap sites and the experimental water and ligand heteroatom positions was generally very tight. Although there were minor differences in the networks of water molecules displaced by ligand in each receptor, 4 displaces roughly 10 water molecules in both cases and stabilizes W1 and W2, seen in the majority of iGluR agonist complexes. However, in GluR2 at the degree of domain closure induced by 4, the ligand sequesters two high-energy water molecules: W3 (5.5 kcal/mol) and W8 (7.0 kcal/mol). In GluR5-S1S2:4, W3 is absent both in the watermap and in the X-ray structure, while W8, which is experimentally observed in molB, is much lower in watermap energy (0.2 kcal/mol); two changes that are expected to confer selectivity. Furthermore, in GluR5, a new water molecule near the ligand, W9, is favorably stabilized. Ser741 and Ser721 (Met708 and Thr686 in GluR2) contribute to the stability of W8 and W9 in GluR5. Finally, in the space between Val685 and the ligand in GluR5 (but not between Leu650 and the ligand in GluR2), watermap predicts a mildly unfavorable displaceable hydration site Wx (1.2 kcal/mol), although only at partial occupancy (64%) and not experimentally observed. This suggests an opportunity for increased selectivity if Wx is displaced, as would be the case by the methyl group of (2S,8R)-5. In summary, the watermaps indicate that the selectivities of 4 and 5 can be understood in terms of the free energies of the binding site water molecules that differ between GluR2 and GluR5 near the ligand. Binding Mode of 5 and Stereoselectivity. To model the binding mode of 5 and determine which diastereomer is likely to be more active, four local minimum-energy conformations of (2S,8R)-5 and (2S,8S)-5 with the charge-bearing heteroatoms constrained to approximate the experimental positions were least-squares superimposed with the experimental coordinates of 4. The complexes were minimized, treating the ligand with DFT and the receptor with molecular mechanics (QM-MM). Side chains in contact with the ligand were allowed to move freely during minimization. In particular, the conformation of Met737 was found to adjust to maximize favorable contact with the ligand. Although it was not possible to determine with certainty the precise preferred ring-puckering mode of 5 when bound, Figure 4 depicts a low-energy complex for each diastereomer. In general, (2S,8R)-5 produced lower energy complexes than (2S,8S)-5, indicating (2S,8R)-5 to be a more active eutomer. Figure 4 also shows the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces (shown as site maps) in the vicinity of the 8-position. These observations illustrate that above the isoxazole plane of the ligands is a more hydrophilic region with limited space. The 8-methyl group of (2S,8S)-5 must bend away to avoid it, forcing part of the seven-membered ring downward below the preferred zone indicated by the binding mode of 4. By contrast, the 8-methyl group of (2S,8R)-5 can be neatly

acccomodated by a hydrophobic volume below the isoxazole plane, in contact with Val685, Ser721 and Met737. The smaller volume of the corresponding hydrophobic space in GluR2 due to Thr686 and Leu650, along with the aforementioned weak hydration site Wx in GluR5, suggest that it is the (2S,8R)-5 diastereomer that confers the observed increased GluR5 selectivity of 5 compared with 4. Thus, these studies indicate that selectivity and potency of this class of compounds may be improved further by synthesizing (2S,8R)-5 analogues stereoselectively. However, initial attempts to develop a synthetic route for this were not successful and the diastereomers could not be separated. Discussion We have presented a new stereoselective synthetic route to the specific GluR5 agonist 4 as well as the X-ray crystal structure of 4 bound to the GluR5 ABD. Furthermore, we have presented structure-based design, synthesis, and pharmacological characterization of a new analogue 5, which turned out to be one of the most potent and selective GluR5 agonists yet described. Compound 4 is interesting because it induces an increased response at ConA-treated homomeric GluR5 receptors compared to the full agonists Glu, 3, and 1.24 This is observed when GluR5 is expressed either transiently in Xenopus laevis oocytes or stably in HEK293 cells.24,30 We decided to investigate the possibility of improving the synthesis of 4 and the pharmacological profile by making a new designed analogue 5. Comparison of the X-ray structure of 4 in the GluR2 agonist binding domain construct with 4 docked in a homology model of the GluR5 agonist binding domain suggested that the selectivity could be improved by introducing increased steric bulk at the 8-position. We focused on improving the synthetic route from 7a, which in the first reported procedure25 provided racemic 4 in 3% yield and in the later stereoselective route24 led to (S)-4 with a yield of 0.4%. Inspired by the use of a Negishi type cross-coupling reaction for introducing the alanine side chain by Jackson and co-workers,28 4 could be synthesized from 7a in 28% yield with an enantiomeric excess of 89%. We

investigated the possibility of using the synthetic strategy to obtain an alkylated analogue of 4 as well as ring and chain homologues. However, the deprotection conditions produced the desired compounds as the main product only for the 8-methylated compound 5, whereas the other analogues yielded complex reaction mixtures in which the desired product could not be identified. A new synthetic route to ketone 7a employing a different O-protecting group would be required to further improve this synthesis. Control of the stereochemistry at the 8-position of 5 would also be an objective of such a route. A pharmacological and biostructural characterization of 4 and 5 was performed as well. The pharmacological studies conclude that 5 is more selective than 4 in two different functional assays and this selectivity profile was also seen in competition binding experiments. The selectivity of 5 as a GluR5 agonist is comparable to that of the standard GluR5 ligand 3. Both compounds 4 and 5 induced an increased response at homomeric GluR5 receptors compared to the full agonists Glu, 1, and 3 when the receptor is treated with ConA to block desensitizitation (Figure 2 and Table 3). These results suggest that these two compounds behave like superagonists of GluR5, inducing a larger current than glutamate at saturating concentrations when receptor densitization is inhibited by ConA. This behavior has to our best knowledge not previously been observed with any other iGluR agonist and may explain previously reported high activity of 4 observed at cat spinal interneurons.25 The superagonist behavior cannot be readily understood at present and requires more detailed kinetic studies of GluR5 activation, and 4 and 5 will be important tools in such studies. Although these compounds behave as superagonists, the crystal structure of 4 in the GluR5 ABD displays only partial domain closure. In X-ray crystal structures of GluR2, this is observed with compounds that are partial agonists and also in the structure of the partial agonist domoic acid in GluR5-S1S2.34 Thus, the current structure presents a challenge to the previously observed relationship between the degree of domain closure and the response induced by orthosteric ligands,35 which has led to the

Experimental ligand (gray) and water positions included for comparison (ball-and-stick) together with H-bond network (fine dashed lines). Transparent spheres indicate clustered water positions, color-coded by entropic (green) and enthalpic (cyan) contribution to free energy (darker is higher G). Key water molecules nearby but not displaced by ligand are labeled W1-W3, W7-8, and Wx, together with selected Gs in kcal/mol. Ligand-stabilized water molecules W1 and W2 are observed in both GluR2 and GluR5. High energy water W3 in GluR2 is not predicted or observed in GluR5. W8 is greatly stabilized in GluR5 vs GluR2. Low energy water W9 in GluR5 is not predicted or observed in GluR2. Low occupancy hydration site Wx (64%) is predicted but too diffuse for observation in GluR5 and absent in GluR2.

hypothesis that agonist efficacy is positively correlated to a high degree of domain closure in kainate receptors. However,

a possible explanation for the observed discrepancy could also be that the use of ConA in our functional assays does not

completely inhibit GluR5 desensitization and that 4 and 5 desensitizes GluR5 to a lesser extent than glutamate. GluR5-S1S2 in complex with 4 shows many similar binding features to the GluR2 structure but also some key differences in the binding pocket in particular with respect to the pattern of waters. We therefore performed a watermap analysis of the GluR5 agonist binding site in comparison with GluR2 to understand the role of individual water molecule binding sites, both observed and virtual, in the selectivity observed. This analysis disclosed that the increased activity of 4 and 5 at GluR5 compared to GluR2 is clearly linked to changes in the energy of particular water molecules in the binding pocket that are stabilized, sequestered, or displaced by the ligand, affirming the utility of this kind of analysis. The high potency and selectivity most likely resides with the (2S,8R) diastereomer of 5 according to binding site mapping and QM-MM calculations. In conclusion, compound 5 is one of the most potent and selective GluR5 agonists yet known and could be an important tool for further studying the functional characteristics of GluR5 in particular with respect to the increased response as well as the general physiological role of GluR5 receptors. Experimental Section
Chemistry. General Procedures. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel F254 plates (Merck). All compounds were detected using UV light and/or by spraying with diluted solutions of KMnO4 or H2SO4/Ce(SO4)2/ ammonium molybdate. Ketones, 3-isoxazolols, and amino groups were developed using standard spraying solutions of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, FeCl3, and ninhydrin, respectively. Column chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel Matrex LC 60A (0.070-0.200 mm). Unless otherwise stated, the petroleum ether used for CC and recrystallizations had distillation ranges 80-100 °C and 40-60 °C, respectively. Organic phases were dried using MgSO4. Melting points were determined in capillary tubes and are uncorrected. 1H (300 MHz), 13C (75 MHz), and associated proton test (APT) NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Gemini-2000 BB spectrometer. Unless otherwise stated, CDCl3 was used as solvent. Chemical shifts are given in ppm () using TMS [1H NMR ( 0.0)] or the CDCl3 peak [13C NMR ( 77.00)] as internal standards. For NMR spectra recorded in D2O, 1,4-dioxane [1H NMR ( 3.70) and 13C NMR ( 69.48)] was used as an internal standard. Elemental analyses were performed at Analytical Research Department, H. Lundbeck A/S, Denmark, or by J. Theiner, Microanalytical Laboratory, Department of Physical Chemistry, University of Vienna, Austria, and are within (0.4% of the theoretical values unless otherwise stated. Stereochemical purity, expressed as enantiomeric excess (ee), was determined using a Chirobiotic T column (4.6 mmÂ150 mm, ASTEC) equipped with a Chirobiotic T guard column (4.6 mm Â 50 mm, ASTEC). The column was eluted at 0.5 mL/min with an aqueous solution of ammonium acetate buffer (15 mM; adjusted to pH 4.0 using AcOH) and EtOH (40/60; v/v %). A TSP system consisting of a P2000 pump, an AS3000 autoinjector, and an SM5000 PDA detector was used. The % ee values were determined from peak areas at 210 nm.

Capped mRNA was synthesized from 1 g of linearized plasmid DNAs by in vitro transcription and purified using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 mRNAcapping kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Purified cRNA was resuspended in H2O to a concentration of 100 ng/L and stored at -80 °C until use. Electrophysiology. Preparation of Oocytes. Mature female Xenopus laevis (NASCO, CA) were anesthetized by submersion into a solution of 0.1% ethyl 3-aminobenzoate dissolved in double-distilled water with 1 g/L CaCO3 and ovaries were surgically removed. The ovarian tissue was dissected and treated with 1.5 mg/mL collagenase in Ca2ş-free Barth's medium (in mM: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 15 Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 MgSO4, 2.4 NaHCO3, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4) for 45-90 min at room temperature. Collagenase-treated oocytes were subsequently maintained in Barth's medium supplemented with 0.41 mM CaCl2. On the second day, oocytes were injected with 25 nL of diluted cRNA (0.03 ng/nL of GluR1i or 0.001 ng/nL of a 1:1 mixture of NR1-1a and NR2A) and incubated in Barth's medium with gentamicin (50 g/mL; G1397, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 17 °C. Oocytes were used for recordings from 3 to 6 days postinjection. Two-Electrode Voltage Clamp Electrophysiology and Determination of Agonist EC50. Recording of membrane currents in oocytes was performed by inserting two glass microelectrodes (resistance: 0.5-2.5 M) filled with 3 M KCl into an oocyte emerged in frog Ringer's solution (in mM: 115 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 BaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.6). Electrodes were voltage clamped with the use of a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (TEV-200A, Dagan Corporation, Minneapolis, MN). Recordings of membrane currents were made while the oocytes were continuously perfused with frog Ringer's solution. Drugs were dissolved in frog Ringer's solution and added to oocytes by full bath application. Agonist concentration-response relationships were constructed by measuring the maximal current induced by bath application of a saturating concentration of agonist to the oocyte (100 M glutamate for GluR1; 100 M glutamate and 100 M glycine for NR1/NR2A), followed by application of compounds in increasing concentrations. The current responses (I) induced by application of a specific concentration of agonist was normalized to the response induced by saturating concentration of Glu (IGLU). The mean of normalized responses from at least five oocytes were plotted as a function of agonist concentration. The concentration-response relationship was determined by curve-fitting of the four parameter logistic equation: I/I0 = 1/(1 ş (EC50/[agonist])n), where I is the agonistevoked current, I0 is the agonist-evoked current in the absence of antagonist, [agonist] is the concentration of agonist, and n is the Hill slope. The Fluo-4 Intracellular Calcium Imaging Assay. Stable GluR1i, GluR2(Q)i, GluR3i, GluR4i, GluR5(Q), and GluR6(Q) HEK293 cell lines were constructed and the functional properties of Glu and compounds 1 and 3-5 were characterized in the Fluo-4/AM assay as previously described.30 The cells were split into poly-D-lysine-coated black 96-well plates with clear bottoms (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). After 16-24 h, the

medium was aspirated and the cells were incubated in 50 L loading buffer (Hanks Buffered Saline Solution (HBSS) containing 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) supplemented with 6 M Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 1 h. The loading buffer was aspirated, the cells were washed with 100 L loading buffer, and then 100 L assay buffer ((HBSS) containing 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4, supplemented with 100 M CTZ in the case of GluR1-4 and with 1 mg/mL ConA in the case of GluR5-6) was added to the wells. Then the 96-well plate was assayed in a NOVOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany), measuring emission (in fluorescence units (FU)) at 520 nm caused by excitation at 485 nm before and up to 60 s after addition of 33 L agonist solution (the agonists were dissolved in assay buffer). The experiments were performed in triplicate at least three times for each compound at each iGluR. X-ray Structure Determination. Expression and crystallization of the GluR5-S1S2 construct comprising the ABD of GluR5 was achieved as previously described.16 A protein solution of 4 mg/mL in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM 4 was used for crystallization with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 L of protein solution with 1 L reservoir solution consisting of 18% PEG4000, 0.3 M Li2SO4, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Crystals grew within two days at 6 °C and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen after transfer through a cryoprotectant of 20% glycerol in reservoir solution. Data were collected at beamline ID14-1, ° ESRF, Grenoble, France, to 2.2 A resolution and were processed using the HKL package.43 The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the structure of GluR5-S1S2 in complex with domoic acid as template.34 The program ARP/ wARP44 was used to automatically build 94% of the residues. Following manual rebuilding in program COOT,45 the structure was refined with the program CNS46 and the ligand could hereafter unambiguously be built into the electron density. The quality of the structure was validated using PROCHECK.47 Domain openings were determined using DynDom.48 Figure 3 was prepared in PyMOL.49 Computational Details. For the ligands 4 and 5 in solution, ab initio (LMP2/6-311şG**) and density functional theory (M062X/6-311şG**) optimizations including Poisson-Boltzmann self-consistent reaction field treatment of continuum solvation (PB-SCRF) were performed in Jaguar 7.5.50 All atom models from both chains of GluR5-S1S2J:4 as well as GluR2-S1S2J:4 (PDB: 1WVJ) were prepared according to the standard protocol for bond assignment, hydrogen addition, H-bonding network optimization, and restrained minimization in Maestro 8.5.49 QM-MM minimizations were performed in Qsite 1.7, which uses Jaguar 7.5 and Impact 5.0.49 The QM region consisted of the each ligand (4, (2S,8R)-5, and (2S,8S)-5) at M06-2X/ 6-311G** and the MM region was handled by the OPLS2005 forcefield, with constraints on all backbone atoms and ° side chains further than 6 A from the ligand. Four input conformations each for 4, (2S,8R)-5, and (2S,8S)-5 were derived from conformational searches in Macromodel 9.649 in which the five fully or partially charged heteroatoms were constrained to the experimental positions and then least-squares superimposed with the native ligand in molA and molB. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic isopotentials were calculated on molA with the ligand, waters, and other heteroatoms removed, using Sitemap 2.2.49 The enthalpies, entropies, and free energies of binding site water molecules with the ligand removed were calculated in ° Watermap 1.0 within a 5 A radius of the experimental positions of 4 in GluR2 (PDB: 1WVJ) and GluR5 (q.v., mol B) based on a pair of 9 ns molecular dynamics simulations in Desmond 2.0,49,51 all with default settings, according to the method of Abel et al.32,33 Figures depicting watermaps and site maps were produced in Maestro 8.5.49
