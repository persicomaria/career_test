in conjunction with the lower observed plasma levels of 7, the observed decrease in antithrombotic efficacy can be rationalized. These results are consistent with observations made by Tucker and coworkers in a peptide series of thrombin inhibitors.* It was demonstrated that for an effective in vivo thrombin inhibitor, there is a

delicate balance of potency, lipophilicity and protein binding which must be exhibited by a single molecule.8 In the series at hand, one solution to this quandary came unexpectedly as a result of synthetic considerations which arose during the preparation of 3 (Scheme 1).

Contrary to our initial thoughts, 5 is essentially equipotent with 1 (Table 1). A priori, we had no reason to expect that an n-propyl group would be accommodated by the S2 pocket of thrombin whereas a cyclopropyl would not. Although the crystal structure of 5 was not determined, the n-propyl group and the 60A-D insertion loop presumably have the flexibility to interact with each other without causing gross distortions of other key interactions with the enzyme backbone. of 3 when accommodated The linear alkyl chain can probably flex out of a modified or adjusted S2 pocket without coming in contact with the adjacent acetamido linkage.` The more rigid cyclopropyl group * by the S2 insertion loop may prevent other sites on the inhibitor from achieving significantly loss in optimal binding with the enzyme. As shown in Table 2, in going from 1 to 5, although the methyl to n-propyl substitution increased the lipophilicity (Log P 1.52 for 5 versus 0.69 for 1) and protein binding (88% for 5 versus 78% for 1 in human plasma and 75% for 5 vs. 47% for 1 in rat plasma), there was not a commensurate

antithrombotic efficacy as was the case for the cyclopropyl substituted compound 3. So whereas in the rat ferric assay, 1 at 10 ug/kg/min had an incidence of occlusion of O/6 rats, the efficacy of 5 was l/6. The average final plasma concentration of 5 during the experiment was 389 nM which is essentially identical to its 2x APTT value (0.4 $4) in rat plasma.

The plasma concentration profile of 5 after oral dosing in dogs was found to be superior to that of 1. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 1, at 5 mpk po, the peak plasma concentration of 5 was 9.46 pM whereas for 1 it was 5.3 1 @I. Duration of action was also improved. The level of 5 in dog plasma was 1.5 pM 8 h post dosing

to 0.6 uM for 1. This improvement in oral absorption was not only confined to dogs. While 1 was in rat plasma following po dosing at 20 mpk, 5 reached peak concentrations of 250 nM following

In conclusion, although the S2 pocket of thrombin provides for a very tight fit for B-methyl pyridinone based thrombin inhibitors, a propyl group is still very well tolerated. Such a substitution provides 5, which retains the excellent potency, selectivity and antithrombotic efficacy of 1 but imparts improved oral absorption

The synthesis of 3 will be described later on in the text. The synthesis of 4 began with (E)-4-butoxy1,1 , 1-trifluoro-3-buten-2-one.` 3 Reaction with nitroacetamide in refluxing ethanolic sodium ethoxide
gave 2-hydroxy-3-nitro-6-trifluoromethylpyridine. All attempts to alkylate the sodium or cesium salt of this compound with haloacetic acid esters resulted in exclusive O-alkylation. Attempted alkylation of the Cbz-protected amino derivative was similarly fruitless. However, treatment with n-ally1 palladium in refluxing THF to gave the N-allylated compound exclusively. The remainder of the synthesis was relatively straightforward. The nitro group was reduced with tin (II) chloride and the resulting amine then sulfonylated with a-toluenesulfonyl chloride. Oxidative cleavage of the olefin was accomplished using the Katsuki/Sharpless procedure 4 to give a mixture of the aldehyde and the corresponding acid. Jones oxidation completed the transformation. Finally, coupling and deprotection as described for 3 gave 4. 7. The full results of SAR studies of the P3 ligand in our pyridinone disclosed at a later date. derived thrombin inhibitors will be
