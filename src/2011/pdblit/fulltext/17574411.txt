STEREOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS OF HR 780 A NEW HIGHLY POTENT HMG-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITOR
G. Wess, K. Kesseler, E. Baader, W. Bartmann, G. Beck, A. Bergmann, H. Jet&alla, K. Bock, G. Holzstein, H. Kleine. M. Schnierer Hoechst AG. Pharma Forschung. Postfach 800320, D-6230 Frankfurt-80 Abstract: HR 780 (1) a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has been synthesized stereoselectively starting from L-malic acid. Wittig 01efiMtion employing phosphonium halides, phosphonates andphosphane oxides have been investigated. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenqme-A mductase (HMG-CoA mductase) are highly

efficacious cholesterol lowering agents.' Lo~astatin,~ Pravastatin3 and Simvastatin4 are the most prominent examples of the naturally derived compounds. HR 780 (1).fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is a a promising clinical candidate exhibiting higher potency and longer half-life than Lovastatin and its congeners.5 Griginally, HR 780 was synthesized via Wittig type coupling of aldehyde 2 with phosphonium bromide6 1Oa. Although HR 780 was obtained optically pure, for large scale preparations the synthesis suffers from several disadvantages. We wish to report a new mom convenient route to optically pure HR 780 using aldehyde7 3 as a key intermediate.

Hydroxy ester 5 was converted to hy&oxy 6-keto ester 6 quantitatively using 3.5 equiv. a-lithio tert-butylacetate (LDA, tert-butylacetate, THF) in THP at -70°C for 1.5 h and at -15°C for 15 min9.

Wittig olefination of 3 with non stabilized phosphoranes generated from phosphonium bromides~`4 10a and lob(n-BuLi, THP) led to mixtures of E- and Z-isomers (11 and 12, table 1 and scheme 2). The desired E-isomer was obtained with 83:17 selectivity by raising the reaction temperature. Addition of lithium bromide had no effect. Homer olefination with phosphonate l4 1Oc gave 11 exclusively (n-BuLi, THP). However, the yield was only 45% along with 30% recovered phosphonate. Phosphane oxide14 10d sufficiently stabilized for E selectivity, but still reactive enough, gave 11in69% yield with an B/Z ratio of 98:2 (n-BuLi, THF). Deprotection/lactonization 23T, of 11with trifluoroacetic acid (15 equiv., dichloromethane, acetate = 1:l). 24 h) gave 116in 75% yield after chromatography on silica (cyclohexanelethyl
