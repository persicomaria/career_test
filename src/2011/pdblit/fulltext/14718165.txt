Structure of the DNA Repair and Replication Endonuclease and Exonuclease FEN-1: Coupling DNA and PCNA Binding to FEN-1 Activity

FEN-1's importance in DNA repair and replication is underscored by both genetic and biochemical evidence. In yeast, FEN-1 mutants display severely impaired phenotypes, such as UV sensitivity, deficient chromosome segregation, conditional lethality, and accumulation in S phase (Murray et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 1995; Reagan et al., 1995; Sommers et al., 1995; Vallen and Corrs, 1995). In DNA repair, FEN-1 participates in the removal of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents and UV radiation (Murray et al., 1994; Reagan et al., 1995; Sommers et al., 1995), likely through an alternate base-excision repair pathway that efficiently removes modified abasic sites and UV-induced photodimers (Klungland and Lindahl, 1997; Kim et al., 1998b). Furthermore, a yeast FEN-1 null mutant is a strong mutator, as unexcised flap strands in Okazaki fragments lead to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks that are repaired by homologous recombination or end joining to yield large sequence duplications throughout the genome (Tishkoff et al., 1997). FEN-1 is also a key enzyme for preventing trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion and contraction, as the same FEN-1 null mutant displayed length-dependent CTG tract destabilization and a marked increase in expansion frequency (Freudenreich et al., 1998). In addition, repeat sequences that can form FEN1-resistant secondary structures may lead to expansions like those observed in several microsatellite and minisatellite tandem repeat regions (Gordenin et al., 1997). Thus, FEN-1 is key for maintaining genome integrity, and mutations in FEN-1 may give rise to a number of genetic diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, several ataxias, fragile X syndrome, and cancer (Tishkoff et al., 1997; Freudenreich et al., 1998; Schweitzer and Livingston, 1998). FEN-1 is an 40 kDa divalent metal ion­dependent exo- and endonuclease that is functionally related to bacterial and bacteriophage 5 3 exonucleases, as well as XPG, a eukaryotic enzyme that functions both in nucleotide-excision repair and the transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage (Harrington and Lieber, 1994; Cooper et al., 1997). FEN-1 specifically recognizes the backbone of a 5 single-stranded flap strand and tracks down this arm to the cleavage site, which is located at the junction where the two strands of duplex DNA adjoin the single-stranded arm (Murante et al., 1994; Bambara et al., 1997). FEN-1 does not cleave bubble substrates, 3 single-stranded flaps, heterologous loops, or Holliday junctions. However, FEN-1 acting as an exonuclease will hydrolyze dsDNA substrates containing a gap or nick. FEN-1 endonuclease activity is independent of 5 flap length, and the endonuclease and exonuclease activities of FEN-1 cleave both DNA and RNA without requiring accessory proteins (Murante et al., 1996). At the replication fork, however, FEN-1 does interact

Summary Flap endonuclease (FEN-1) removes 5 overhanging flaps in DNA repair and processes the 5 ends of Okazaki fragments in lagging strand DNA synthesis. The crystal structure of Pyrococcus furiosus FEN-1, activesite metal ions, and mutational information indicate interactions for the single- and double-stranded portions of the flap DNA substrate and identify an unusual DNA-binding motif. The enzyme's active-site structure suggests that DNA binding induces FEN-1 to clamp onto the cleavage junction to form the productive complex. The conserved FEN-1 C terminus binds proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and positions FEN-1 to act primarily as an exonuclease in DNA replication, in contrast to its endonuclease activity in DNA repair. FEN-1 mutations altering PCNA binding should reduce activity during replication, likely causing DNA repeat expansions as seen in some cancers and genetic diseases. Introduction The fidelity of DNA replication, recombination, and repair is essential for maintaining genome stability, and all of these processes depend on 5 3 exonucleases, which occur in all three kingdoms of life. For DNA repair, these enzymes are required for damaged fragment excision and recombinational mismatch correction (Johnson et al., 1995; Reagan et al., 1995; Sommers et al., 1995). For replication, these nucleases are critical for the efficient processing of Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis (Goulian et al., 1990; Lyamichev et al., 1993; Turchi and Bambara, 1993; Waga et al., 1994). In Escherichia coli, this latter activity is provided by DNA polymerase I (PolI); E. coli strains with inactivating mutations in the PolI 5 3 exonuclease domain are not viable due to an inability to process Okazaki fragments (Uyemura and Lehman, 1976). Eukaryotic DNA polymerases, however, lack an intrinsic 5 3 exonuclease domain, and this critical activity is provided by

with other proteins, including a DNA helicase (Budd and Campbell, 1997) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the processivity factor for DNA polymerases and . Biochemical and genetic experiments show that FEN-1 interacts with a hydrophobic cleft on the front face of the PCNA trimer (Li et al., 1995; Chen et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1996; Jonsson et al., 1998), suggesting that in vivo PCNA recruits FEN-1 to branched DNA substrates near the replication fork. This FEN-1­ PCNA interaction is mediated by conserved residues near the FEN-1 C terminus and is disrupted by p21, which also binds to PCNA and halts cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage (el Deiry et al., 1994). By binding competitively to the same region of PCNA as FEN-1, p21 may release FEN-1 from the replication fork, thereby switching the function of FEN-1 from DNA replication to DNA repair. We have surveyed the genome of the archaea Pyrococcus furiosus and found that this extreme thermophile encodes a FEN-1 enzyme that is highly homologous to the eukaryotic FEN-1 enzymes (Shen et al., 1998). To reconcile the dual roles of FEN-1 in DNA repair and replication and establish a structural basis for understanding FEN-1 activity, we isolated, crystallized, and determined the structure of P. furiosus FEN-1 as reported here. Key structural features involved in FEN-1 DNA binding and catalysis are herein identified, which along with flap endonuclease activity and mutational data, and FEN-1 binding to PCNA, provide a coherent view of the key functions FEN-1 performs in the cell. Results and Discussion Flap Endonuclease Activity To assess FEN-1 activity in both mesophiles and thermophiles, we identified, cloned, overexpressed, and purified FEN-1 from P. furiosus (see Experimental Procedures) and assayed the 5 3 flap endonuclease activity of both the purified archaebacterial and human FEN-1 enzymes. As P. furiosus is an extreme thermophile, most of its enzymes function optimally at elevated temperatures. Thus, at 37 C, where human FEN-1 (hFEN-1) functions optimally, the purified P. furiosus FEN-1 (pFEN-1) enzyme has reduced endonuclease activity. As the assay temperature is increased, hFEN-1 activity decreases while pFEN-1 activity becomes substantially higher (Figure 1). While the temperature optima of the human and archaebacterial enzymes are different, the high level of amino acid sequence homology (42% identical, 60% similar, Figure 2A) and the similar biochemical activities of these enzymes (Hosfield et al., 1998) imply that the key structural features necessary for FEN-1 function are conserved among the eukaryotic and archaebacterial enzymes. Structure Determination and Overview ° We determined the crystal structure of pFEN-1 to 2.0 A resolution by using multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) phases from five heavy atom derivatives, augmented by anomalous scattering information from two of the derivatives and a crystal containing selenomethionine-substituted enzyme (Table 1, see Experimental

FEN-1 loads onto the free 5 end of the substrate strand, slides to the junction of ssDNA and dsDNA formed at the intersection of the three DNA strands, and cleaves at the junction as indicated by the arrows. The asterisk at the 5 end of the substrate strand indicates the radiolabel. (B) hFEN-1 and pFEN-1 were incubated with this flap substrate at either 37 C or 55 C as indicated. The 19-nucleotide and 21-nucleotide reaction products result from FEN-1 catalyzed cleavage one nucleotide 3 and one nucleotide 5 of the junction point. While the human enzyme was active only at the lower temperature (lane 1), the pyrococcal enzyme showed substantially higher activity at 55 C (lane 4). The human FEN-1 enzyme was purified as described (Nolan et al., 1996). Lane C is the control (no enzyme).

Procedures). The crystals contain two pFEN-1 molecules in the asymmetric unit providing additional accuracy and information on the structural variability in the different crystal environments. The experimental electron density maps were of sufficient quality to allow initial placement of 310 and 280 residues, respectively, for each separate pFEN-1 enzyme. The known positions of four of the five methionine residues in each molecule, calculated with data from the selenomethionine-substituted crystal, assisted in unambiguous placement of the correct amino acid sequence in these initial structural models. Subsequent refinement and refitting to electron density difference maps provided the final model consisting of residues 2­340 (the N-terminal methionine and histidine-containing tag are disordered) in both of the crystallographically independent pFEN-1 molecules.

strands in a parallel orientation (). After 6, the polypeptide chain extends out from the main body of pFEN-1 and forms a two-stranded antiparallel ribbon ( A/ B, Figures 2A and 2B), followed by 7, the only antiparallel strand of the central seven-stranded sheet. Following 7, the polypeptide forms a helical subdomain, and an extended loop connects this subdomain to two helices and the C-terminal nine residues that extend away from the body of the enzyme (Figure 2B). The A/ B insertion in the pFEN-1 sequence, which forms part of a groove wall around the active site, is not present in the human enzyme (Figure 2A) nor in other eukaryotic or archaebacterial flap endonucleases except for the closely related FEN-1 enzyme from Archaeglobus fulgidus (Shen et al., 1998). Active-Site Groove and DNA-Binding Motifs The central pFEN-1 sheet is flanked by helices and the A/ B antiparallel ribbon. Together, these structural elements form a distinct groove lying at the C-terminal edge of the sheet, which is identified as the substratebinding region by the presence of catalytically important residues. The groove is positively charged for interaction with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the flap DNA substrate (Figure 3A) and strictly conserved FEN-1 aspartate and glutamate residues (Figure 2A), which interact with the divalent metal ions required for activity (see next section), cluster at the bottom of the ° groove, 16 A below the groove rim. Of the major helices in pFEN-1, 13 and 14, near the C terminus, pack with 3 and 6 to form a four-helix bundle that buttresses 2 between the A/ B ribbon and the 4 and 5 helices (Figure 2B), which together form one groove wall. The 4 and 5 helices lie on the surface of the enzyme, packing in an antiparallel orientation with 5 directing

polar and basic residues into the groove, and are preceded by a loop rich in Lys, Arg, and Glu residues (residues 82­104 contain 17 charges in a total of 23 residues). This highly charged 3- 4 loop extends to the other groove wall and together with 4 and 5 defines a "helical clamp" through which a single-stranded flap strand is likely threaded (see below). The other groove wall is formed mainly by the N terminus and the flat face of the glycine-rich loop connecting 10 and 11. This 13residue loop with its flanking helices has sequence similarity to the Helix-hairpin-Helix (HhH) motif, first seen in endonuclease III (Thayer et al., 1995). Structurally, the HhH motif consists of a pair of antiparallel helices connected by a four-residue single hairpin turn and is found in a diverse family of DNA-binding proteins (Doherty et al., 1996). In pFEN-1 however, the 13 residues between 10 and 11 form three consecutive four-residue turns (Figure 3B), suggesting key differences in DNA backbone binding. At the apex of the first turn, the side chains of conserved Asp-236 and Tyr-237, protrude into the FEN-1 active site, with the turn being completed by a bifurcated hydrogen bond formed between Thr-235 N and O to Asn-238 O 1 (Figure 3C). This turn is anchored to the protein via an Asn-238 N 2 to Ile-231 O hydrogen bond that caps 10. Initiating the second turn of this structured loop, Asn-238 O hydrogen bonds with Gly241 N, creating a type I turn with intervening Pro-239 and Gly-240. The third four-residue turn, which resembles the HhH hairpin turn (Figure 3B), is closed by a hydrogen bond from Ile-242 O to Ile-245 N, with both Ile side chains packing within a hydrophobic pocket. Similar to the HhH motif, Lys-243 and the backbone amides of Gly-244 and Gly-246 are directed toward solvent to likely interact with DNA phosphate groups (Figure 3C). Thus, the pFEN-1 Helix-3Turn-Helix (H3TH) motif has some structural features in common with HhH

The C positions of the residues in the third turn of the H3TH motif are similar to those in the single HhH hairpin turn and include the conserved glycines and the lysine that are proposed to interact nonspecifically with dsDNA phosphate groups. The three turns of the pFEN-1 H3TH motif include residues Thr-235­Asn-238 (Turn1), Asn-238­Gly-241 (Turn2), and Ile-242­Ile-245 (Turn3).

Absolutely conserved residues Asp-236 and Tyr237 (right) protrude into the active site of the enzyme and contribute to divalent metal ion binding, while conserved Gly-244 and Gly-246 (left) direct their backbone amide groups toward solvent for interaction with dsDNA phosphates.

motif enzymes, yet its greater length and increased rigidity (owing to the extensive hydrogen bonds that link the loop residues not only to themselves but also to the secondary structure in this region of pFEN-1; Figure 3C) support a prominent role in DNA substrate binding. The proposed role of the HhH motif, to interact nonspecifically with duplex DNA sugar-phosphates via the glycine

backbone amides, was subsequently directly observed in DNA polymerase and E. coli RuvA cocrystal structures with dsDNA (Pelletier et al., 1996; Sawaya et al., 1997; Hargreaves et al., 1998). We propose here that the highly conserved pFEN-1 H3TH motif also functions in DNA binding, likely through interactions with the phosphodiester backbone of the dsDNA of flap substrates.

The prominent active-site DNA-binding groove observed in the pFEN-1 structure is highly constrained and clearly defined as a result of the A/ B antiparallel ribbon that is absent in the eukaryotic FEN-1 enzymes (Figure ° 2). The groove measures 32 A in width at the mouth formed between Lys-199 of the A/ B hairpin and Lys° 243 of the H3TH motif, and it is 44 A long when measured between 11-Lys-248 and the helical clamp residue Arg94, suggesting that FEN-1 contacts approximately 12 base pairs of dsDNA during substrate binding and catalysis. The positioning of the A/ B antiparallel ribbon at the mouth of the groove reveals that the orientation of a flap substrate at the pFEN-1 active site is more tightly constrained than in eukaryotic FEN-1 enzymes that lack this A/ B ribbon. The presence of the ribbon may explain some of the distinctive catalytic properties shared by the P. furiosus and A. fulgidus enzymes (Hosfield et al., 1998). As the A/ B antiparallel ribbon in the pFEN-1 structure encloses a more defined and conformationally restricted DNA-binding groove, this motif may be a structural adaptation allowing these thermophilic enzymes to function efficiently at elevated temperatures.

H3TH motif, with long loop insertions in both the polymerase exonuclease domain and the T4 enzyme. Interestingly, the first interlocked tight turn of the H3TH motif, which protrudes into the active site, is highly similar in all four enzymes, with each having a conserved Asp that interacts with a metal ion in the active site.

Structural Comparisons of FEN-1 to Other 5 3 Exonucleases Despite low amino acid sequence homology ( 10% amino acid identity when the three-dimensional structures are overlaid), crystal structures of the functionally related 5 exonuclease domain of Thermus aquaticus (Taq) DNA polymerase (Kim et al., 1995) and the 5 3 exonucleases from bacteriophages T4 (Mueser et al., 1996) and T5 (Ceska et al., 1996) share a similar / topology to pFEN-1 (Figure 4A). Structural similarities between the two enzyme groups are concentrated within the N-terminal subdomain's (pFEN-1 residues 2­250) central sheet and structural helices with root° mean-square deviations when superimposed of 2.5 A for 120 residues of Taq polymerase 5 3 exonuclease ° domain, of 2.6 A for 95 residues of T5 5 exonuclease, ° and of 3.3 A for 71 residues of T4 RnaseH. However, when FEN-1 is overlaid with the T5 5 exonuclease structure, it is apparent that FEN-1 contains 13 additional amino acids between 3 and 6 and that this 50-residue region of FEN-1 is defined by the helical clamp (Figure 2A). In the T5 structure, this same region adopts a "helical arch," which is formed by a long, six-turn helix, which lines one arch wall, and a second three-turn helix, which lines the other (Ceska et al., 1996). The extra amino acids that must be accommodated by FEN-1 may account for the different supersecondary structures observed in the two enzymes (Figure 4A). In contrast to the viral and eubacterial enzymes in which the N-terminal residues are disordered and proteolytic removal has no effect on catalysis (Ceska et al., 1996), the N-terminal residues of FEN-1 are well ordered and abut the active site, suggesting they may modulate substrate binding, catalysis, or both. The FEN-1 and 5 exonuclease structures diverge toward their C termini, yet all four enzymes possess the proposed dsDNA-binding surface corresponding to the H3TH motif identified here in pFEN-1. Notably, this structural similarity is least conserved in the second and third turns of the pFEN-1

Active-Site Metal Ion Environment The pFEN-1 active site is identified by two clusters of acidic residues that are absolutely conserved in all the known FEN-1 enzymes (Hosfield et al., 1998). Metalsoaking experiments reveal the roles of these two acidic residue clusters in forming the biologically relevant Mg2 -binding sites. Asp-27, Asp-80, Glu-152, and Glu154 form the first Mg2 site (M-1) with the two Asps directly ligating the metal ion (Figure 4B). This metal site is preorganized as the positions of the Asp carboxylates are fixed by hydrogen bonds that cap the N termini of 2 and 7. Glu-152 interacts with M-1 via a water ligand, while Glu-154 may bridge the two metal ions through water-mediated contacts. The second metal ion (M-2), ° which is 5 A from the preformed M-1 site, binds at the second cluster of conserved, acidic residues: Asp-173, Asp-175, and Asp-236 of the H3TH motif. Mutation of hFEN-1 at any one of these seven carboxylates, which are metal ligands in pFEN-1, abolishes enzyme activity (Shen et al., 1996, 1997), supporting the relevance of the metal sites identified here and the conservation of FEN-1 active-site structure­function relationships from human to archaea. Conserved Tyr-237 also links the H3TH motif with the two metal sites via a hydrogen bond to Glu-152 and a water-mediated contact with Asp-175 (Figure 4B). FEN-1 mutants distinguish the functional roles of each metal site in substrate binding and catalysis. The preformed M-1 metal ion site has a critical catalytic role, as site-directed mutants with substitutions of the homologous metal ligand residues in hFEN-1 (Figure 2A) lack flap endonuclease activity yet bind substrate with affinities near that of the wild-type protein (Shen et al., 1997). A key catalytic role for M-1 is also seen in the functionally related bacteriophage T4 RNaseH where mutation of residues ligating this metal ion abolishes enzyme activity, yet mutants at the second metal site retained activity (Bhagwat et al., 1997). The M-2 metal ion site is required to form an active complex, as replacement of residues homologous to Asp-173 and Asp-236 creates mutant enzymes that are inactive due to the inability to bind flap substrate DNA (Shen et al., 1997). The eubacterial and phage 5 exonucleases, along with FEN-1, may employ a two-metal-ion mechanism as seen for the 3 -5 exonuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Beese and Steitz, 1991). This mechanism involves nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphodiester bond at the flap junction by a hydroxide ion activated by one divalent metal, while the expected pentacoordinate transition state and the leaving oxyanion are stabilized by a second divalent metal ion that is 3.9 ° A from the first. However, as in pFEN-1, the distance between the bound metal ions in the bacterial and bacteriophage enzymes is greater than expected for a twometal-ion catalytic mechanism, and the active site would

Data collected from pFEN-1 crystals soaked with 2 mM PbCl2 and 500 mM MnSO4 reveal metal site M-1 (Fmetal Fnat difference electron density colored yellow and contoured at 15 ) and metal site M-2 (Fmetal Fnat difference electron density colored green and contoured at 5 ), respectively.

Absolutely conserved pFEN-1 Tyr-237, from the H3TH motif, penetrates into the active site more deeply than does Tyr-86 from the T4 enzyme. Differences in the nature and positions of the conserved active-site residues in T4 RNaseH and FEN-1 likely influence the metal site positions and the distances between them in each enzyme.

A flap DNA substrate was modeled into the cleft with the phosphodiester backbone poised to interact with the H3TH domain (magenta). The helical clamp (green) caps the active site and may serve to stabilize the bound substrate by interacting with ssDNA and/or dsDNA. During repair, the 5 flap strand (white) passes over the active site and through the helical clamp.

thus have to contract upon binding DNA for this mechanism to hold for these enzymes. Notably, FEN-1 and T4 RNaseH mutant data suggest that M-2 may be structural, acting to enable DNA substrate­induced enzyme conformational changes that form the productive complex, suggesting that the reaction mechanism of FEN-1catalyzed bond cleavage differs from that employed by the E. coli polymerase 3 5 exonuclease domain. Differences in the number and nature of the metal ligating residues between pFEN-1 and the prokaryotic and phage-encoded exonucleases may account for the particular specificities and reaction product distributions of each individual enzyme (Shen et al., 1996; Bhagwat et al., 1997; Hosfield et al., 1998). In the eubacterial and viral enzymes, the FEN-1 bridging metal ligand Glu154 is replaced by a shorter Asp residue, which does not interact as closely with M-2, while pFEN-1 Ala-155 and Thr-234 are also replaced by Asp residues in T4 RNaseH (Mueser et al., 1996). These substitutions near the active site may influence the positions of the metal sites and the distances between them (Figure 4C). Furthermore, the bacterial 5 exonucleases also have conserved Asps from their H3TH loops that interact with M-2, but the structurally conserved tyrosine protrudes into their active sites from a different region of the protein. As a result of this "tyrosine-switch," pFEN-1 Tyr237 penetrates more deeply into the active site than does the tyrosine in the eubacterial and viral enzymes (Figure 4C). Finally, the bacterial and phage active sites contain several Arg and Lys residues that may mediate contacts with the phosphate backbone of a flap substrate (Ceska et al., 1996; Mueser et al., 1996). pFEN-1, however, lacks these residues, suggesting that flap strand interactions are mediated via a different mechanism.

Coupled DNA Binding and Catalysis The pFEN-1 structure suggests a coherent model for binding the DNA flap substrate that couples DNA binding to catalysis through the H3TH motif and the 4/ 5 helical clamp, which can open and close around a singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) flap strand. With the scissile phosphodiester bond at the active-site metal ion M-1, and the duplex DNA of the flap substrate binding at the H3TH motif, the 5 flap strand would extend through the pFEN-1 helical clamp. The clamp is lined by polar and charged residues from the extended loop on one side and on the other side from the antiparallel 4/ 5 helical hairpin. With 5 located directly above the active site, the space through which the single-stranded 5 flap must be threaded is relatively small. Yet, FEN-1 must be capable of expanding this hole in order to slip past bulky adducts on the flap strand (Barnes et al., 1996), and consistent with such a conformational change, binding of a flap substrate to hFEN-1 causes the enzyme to become considerably more compact (B. S., unpublished data), with a concomitant increase in the -helical content of the enzyme (Kim et al., 1998a). The helical clamp is anchored at the extended N-terminal end by residues 83­86 (Pro-Pro-Glu-Phe), which form tight interactions including packing against Phe-278 and active-site Tyr-237. We therefore propose that the pFEN-1 4/ 5 helical hairpin and the extended loop following this motif constitute the region likely to undergo this coilhelix transition, and therefore the observed FEN-1 crystal structure represents a closed DNA-bound conformation. Thus, during DNA binding and catalysis, FEN-1 can load onto and track along the 5 flap strand with an open clamp by expanding the opening between the active site and the 4/ 5 helical hairpin as necessary. Upon reaching the flap junction, the dsDNA of the

FEN-1 Structure and DNA Recognition 143

flap substrate binds to the H3TH motif, while the 4/ 5 helices clamp down on top of the 5 flap strand at the active site to form the closed helical clamp conformation (Figure 5). In addition to this helical clamp, the location of conserved Asp-236 and Tyr-237 at the apex of the H3TH dsDNA-binding motif suggests substrate binding may also induce a condensation of the active site around the target phosphate that excludes bulk solvent and brings key residues and metal ions together to thereby link substrate binding to catalysis. Deletion mutational analysis of segments of the helical clamp defined here can be used to experimentally characterize its role in localizing cleavage during DNA repair to the junction between dsDNA and the 5 flap. The targeting of FEN-1 to DNA flap junctions by the helical clamp region is consistent with the distinct damage specificity of the homologous XPG protein where this protruding clamp region is replaced by an 600-residue domain essential to some of the targeting functions unique to the XPG nuclease (O'Donovan et al., 1994). This pFEN-1 architecture differs significantly from that seen in T5 exonuclease where two helices form a "helical arch" creating a large hole with positively charged residues lining one arch wall and hydrophobic residues lining the other (Figure 4A). However, no exposed hydrophobic residue clusters, which were suggested to interact with DNA bases in the T5 structure, are observed in the FEN-1 helical clamp. Thus, nonspecific interactions with the 5 flap strand phosphodiester backbone and a DNA binding­induced active-site condensation are probable key determinants for formation of catalytic FEN-1:DNA complexes. In the other 5 3 exonuclease enzymes, the region corresponding to the T5 helical arch and the pFEN-1 helical clamp are also evidently flexible, suggesting that a similar substrateinduced coupling of DNA binding to catalysis, as herein proposed for pFEN-1, may be a general mechanism employed by the entire FEN-1 family of structure-specific endonucleases.

FEN-1:PCNA Interactions at the DNA Replication Fork FEN-1 interacts with PCNA at the DNA replication fork, and a probable molecular basis for this interaction is revealed by the pFEN-1 structure. PCNA, which forms a toroidal structure that encircles DNA, functions as a sliding clamp that tethers DNA polymerase and other replication factors, such as DNA ligase (Jonsson et al., 1998), DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase (Chuang et al., 1997), and XPG (Gary et al., 1997) to the DNA duplex during strand synthesis. Moreover, PCNA is central to the arrest of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, and this arrest is regulated by the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1/CIP1, which is induced through a p53-mediated signaling pathway (Waldman et al., 1996). FEN-1 from archaebacteria all have residues at their C termini that are homologous to critical residues of eukaryotic proteins known to interact with PCNA (Hosfield et al., 1998; Shen et al., 1998; Warbrick, 1998). Thus, to determine whether PCNA binding is conserved among these two different kingdoms of life, we measured the equilibrium dissociation constant of

pFEN-1 to human PCNA and found that pFEN-1 does bind to human PCNA with an affinity of 120 nM (Figure 6A). An elegant model for FEN-1 function in DNA replication is revealed by docking our pFEN-1 structure onto the crystal structure of the human PCNA:p21 peptide complex (Gulbis et al., 1996) by superimposing the protruding pFEN-1 C terminus, which mediates PCNA binding, onto the p21 peptide. Notably, our FEN-1:PCNA model places FEN-1 in front of the replication apparatus on the C-terminal face of PCNA (Figure 6B), where other replication proteins, such as polymerase and replication factor C (RF-C), also bind to the PCNA trimer. Thus, in addition to FEN-1, RF-C and polymerase could be simultaneously attached to the same PCNA trimer during processive synthesis of the lagging strand. RF-C and PCNA would provide the polymerase with its processivity and, upon reaching the downstream Okazaki fragment, displacement synthesis would generate a 5 flap requiring removal by FEN-1. Our structure positions FEN-1, bound to PCNA at the replication fork, to bind dsDNA via the H3TH motif (Figure 6B). As processive synthesis proceeds, the proximity of FEN-1 to the site of the growing flap strand suggests that the displaced Okazaki fragment is threaded through the helical clamp and cleaved, thus limiting the generation of long 5 flaps. We therefore hypothesize that FEN-1 bound to PCNA at the DNA replication fork functions primarily as an exonuclease or short-flap endonuclease, when performing its critical role in strand synthesis. In contrast, FEN-1 acting in DNA repair may bind and cleave longer 5 flaps and act solely as an endonuclease. This structure-based hypothesis for FEN-1 function in vivo, which can be tested by mutational analysis, highlights the importance of the FEN-1:PCNA complex. Mutations in FEN-1 that disrupt the PCNA interaction, but still retain FEN-1 catalytic activity, would reduce the localization of FEN-1 to the replication fork, where it can efficiently use its exonuclease activity, and thus would lead to the generation of long flap strands during replication. When such displaced yet unexcised flap strands form FEN-1 resistant secondary structures, as expected for short repeated DNA sequences, the inability of the FEN-1 endonuclease activity to remove these sequences provides a specific molecular basis for the observed expansion of such short repeats in some human cancers and heritable genetic diseases.

Conclusions These structural results for pFEN-1, together with FEN-1 biochemical and mutational results, and the PCNA structure (Gulbis et al., 1996), provide important insights into how FEN-1 functions in both DNA repair and replication. The FEN-1 active-site groove, DNA-binding motifs, and metal ion environments constrain possible duplex and flap strand positions and support induced conformational changes upon DNA binding that would couple substrate binding to catalysis. Two structural motifs evidently mediate binding of the double-stranded and single-stranded regions of the flap DNA substrate: the H3TH motif is situated to form a platform that links nonspecific dsDNA binding to the active site, while the 5

life and assists in clarifying the role of FEN-1 during DNA replication. The conserved C terminus of FEN-1, which extends away from the body of the enzyme and provides a motif that is structurally independent from the FEN-1 catalytic domain, mediates recruitment of FEN-1 to the DNA replication fork apparatus by interacting with the conserved C-terminal face of PCNA. Given the critical role of FEN-1 in DNA repair and replication, this structure supports distinct preferential exonuclease activity in replication compared to the endonuclease activity in DNA repair and provides an initial understanding of the structure­function relationships common to the entire FEN-1 enzyme family, which is central to processes influencing genome stability and early events that modulate cancer susceptibility and tumorigenesis.
Experimental Procedures Cloning and Protein Purification The P. furiosus fen-1 gene was identified as part of a survey of the P. furiosus genome (Borges et al., 1996), and the gene sequence and genomic DNA were used to design polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers to amplify the gene from P. furiosus genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into pET-15B (Novagen), which incorporated a 6 - Histidine tag at the N terminus of the FEN-1 protein. The resulting plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and FEN-1 was overexpressed in 6 l batches. Following induction with 0.4 mM IPTG, the cells were grown for 18 hr, pelleted, and taken up in buffer H1 (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). The cells were lysed by heating the cell suspension at 75 C for 45 min. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 25000 g and the supernatant loaded onto a 25 ml Ni-NTA Sepharose column (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated in H1. After washing with 200 ml H1, FEN-1 was eluted with H1 containing 500 mM imidazole and dialyzed against buffer F1 (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Using a Pharmacia FPLC, the dialyzed protein was purified on a Poros HQ anion exchanger and a Poros HS cation exchanger (Perseptive Biosystems). FEN-1 was eluted using a linear salt gradient from 150­800 mM NaCl in F1 buffer, and fractions containing the enzyme, identified by SDS-PAGE, were dialyzed back into buffer F1. Additional purification was achieved by gel filtration on Sephadex-75 (Pharmacia), and pure pFEN-1 was pooled and concentrated to 100 mg/ml. Selenomethionine-substituted pFEN-1 was overexpressed in the E. coli methionine auxotroph DL41 that had been lysogenized with the DE3 gene, and purified as wild-type.

Figure 6. Equilibrium Binding Measurements of pFEN-1 to PCNA and Model for FEN-1/PCNA/DNA Interactions at the DNA Replication Fork (A) His-tagged pFEN-1 was coupled to a BIAcore-NTA chip, and the equilibrium binding affinity of pFEN-1 for human PCNA was measured by monitoring the change in response units as a function of decreasing PCNA concentrations. By this method, the pFEN1:hPCNA equilibrium dissociation constant was measured to be 120 nM, demonstrating that the FEN-1:PCNA interaction is conserved among two kingdoms of life. The PCNA concentration (shown to the right of selected curves) flowed over the chip varied from 1000 nM to 1.3 nM (see Experimental Procedures). (B) The FEN-1 C terminus (orange) was docked onto the surface of the human PCNA trimer according to the crystal structure of PCNA with bound p21 peptide (Gulbis et al., 1996). Double-stranded DNA containing a short 5 flap was placed through the center of the PCNA trimer with the 5 end of the Okazaki fragment poised to be threaded through the FEN-1 helical clamp and into the FEN-1 active site. With FEN-1 acting as an exonuclease and facing forward during DNA replication, the proximity of the enzyme to the growing flap would prevent the generation of long Okazaki fragments that could form FEN-1-resistant secondary structures. During DNA synthesis, the additional binding sites on the PCNA trimer could be occupied by additional replication factors.

flap strand would then pass through the helical clamp motif, which caps the active site to facilitate phosphodiester bond cleavage. Furthermore, the interaction of P. furiosus FEN-1 with a eukaryotic PCNA reveals that this interaction is conserved across two kingdoms of

pFEN-1 Activity Assays and PCNA Binding FEN-1 endonuclease assays were performed according to the method of Harrington and Lieber (1994). Briefly, in a final volume of 13 l, pure hFEN-1 (15 ng) and pFEN-1 (150 ng) were incubated with 1.54 pmol of 32P labeled flap substrate that was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide 5 -CACGTTGACTACCGTC with 5 -GGA CTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAACGTG and 5 -GATGTCAAGCAG TCCTAACTTTGAGGCAGAGTCC. After a 30 min incubation at either 37 C or 55 C, the reaction was quenched with an equal volume of stop solution (20 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 80% deionized formamide, and 0.008% bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol), electrophoresed through denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by autoradiography. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were employed to monitor the interaction between human PCNA and pFEN-1. Forty microliters of 10 nM His-tagged pFEN-1 was immobilized on a BIAcore-NTA chip according to the manufacturer's protocol, at a flow rate of 10 l/min in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 50 M EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20. The pFEN-1:PCNA interaction was monitored by passing different amounts of human PCNA (1000, 152, 126, 83, 42, 28, 14, 7, 3.5, and 1.3 nM) over the chip at a flow rate of 4 l/min in the same buffer. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated using software supplied by the manufacturer.

Crystallization and X-Ray Data Collection Crystals of pFEN-1 are grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (100 mg/ml) with the precipitant solution (60% saturated [NH4]2SO4, 50 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM imidazole/malate buffer [pH 6.5]). Large, single, diffraction quality crystals grew at room temperature over a period of 2 weeks to a maximum size of 0.5 0.5 0.3 mm. The crystals contain two copies of pFEN-1 in the crystallographic asymmetric unit and belong to the orthorhombic space group C2221, with cell dimensions a ° 116, b 122, c 135 A. The calculated Matthews' coefficient, VM, of 2.9 is consistent with a solvent content of 58%. X-ray diffraction data for the wild-type crystal were collected at the Stanford Syn° chrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) on beam line 9-1 ( 0.98 A), using a 30 cm MARRESEARCH imaging plate. Single wavelength ° data to 2.9 A from a selenomethionine-substituted crystal were col° lected on beam line 7­1 at SSRL ( 1.08 A), while heavy atom derivative data were collected with a Siemens rotating anode generator operating at 50 kW and 100 mA. For data collection, all crystals were briefly immersed in precipitant solution containing 20% glycerol as cryo-protectant and flash frozen in a N2 stream at 170 C. All data were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). MIR Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement The structure of pFEN-1 was solved by MIR with anomalous scattering using phases calculated from the selenomethionine-substituted crystal and five heavy atom derivatives (Table 1). Selenium and heavy atom positions were determined from isomorphous difference Patterson maps and from difference and cross-Fourier maps calculated with the XtalView system of programs (McRee, 1992, 1993). The heavy atom positions, temperature factors, and occupancies were refined and MIR phases calculated using the PHASES package ° (Furey and Swaminathan, 1990) to give a 3.0 A resolution phase set with an overall figure of merit of 0.76. Phase improvement by solvent flattening and 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging with the program DM (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994) gave an electron density map that was readily interpretable and allowed modeling of approximately 90% of the residues using the program XFIT (McRee, 1992). This partial model was refined using stereochemically restrained rigid body refinement followed by positional refinement and simulated annealing with X-PLOR 3.8 (Brunger et al., 1987). Prior to refinement, 10% of the reflections ¨ were excluded and used for cross-validation to calculate a free R ° value (Brunger, 1992). The model resolution was extended to 2.0 A ¨ with refinement of individual atomic temperature values, and portions of the model that were not initially traced were fit using successive rounds of rebuilding to both a-weighted (Read, 1986) Fobs-Fcalc and simulated annealing omit maps. Application of a bulk solvent ° correction allowed low resolution data to 20 A to be included in the refinement. Acknowledgments We thank C. M. Bruns, C. M. Hosfield, T. P. Lo, S. S. Parikh, and C.
