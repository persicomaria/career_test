1. Introduction Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a blood-borne virus previously referred to as non-A, non-B hepatitis, infects 200 million people worldwide.1 Untreated HCV infections can progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.2 Currently, a-interferon and PEG-interferon monotherapies or in combination with the antiviral drug ribavirin are the only approved treatment options.3 Although combination therapy is reasonably successful with genotypes 2 and 3, its efficacy against the predominant genotype 1 is moderate at best. Therefore, several research groups have been working toward the development of a more effective, convenient, and tolerable treatment. Because of its vital role in viral replication,4 HCV NS3 serine protease has been actively pursued as a viral protein target.5 Oligopeptide derivatives containing a-ketoamide electrophilic trap have been reported by our group6 and others7 to be potent inhibitors of HCV NS3 serine protease. More recently, we demonstrated that introduction of a phenylglycine residue at P02 position improved the binding potency of P3-capped ketoamide inhibitor of type 1 (Fig. 1).8 From the X-ray crystal structure of compound

1 bound to the protease, it was evident that the P1 ­P02 side chains formed a C-clamp around Lys136 of the protease and thus provided extensive hydrophobic interaction that resulted in improved potency. X-ray crystal structure analysis also revealed a close proximity of P2 side chain to arginine 155. Unsuccessful attempts from our group6 and others9 to make a salt bridge between Arg155 and a variety of charged species at P2 prompted us to evaluate the possibility of hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of that residue and hydrophobic moieties of the P2 position. To assess the effect of replacement of leucine at P2 with more lypophilic residues, we decided to take advantage of hydrophobic sulfide moiety by introducing thioketals in the P2 position. Better hydrophobic contact could also be accomplished via incorporation of larger alkyl and cycloalkyl chains at that position (Fig. 2).

Scheme 1.

Hydroxyl amide 2, containing P3­P2 0 residues, was identified as a key intermediate for the synthesis of ketals at P2 (Scheme 1).

Synthesis of a-hydroxyl amide 2 and inhibitors of type 4 are depicted in Scheme 2. Thus, dipeptide 6,6 bearing the hydroxyl amide moiety, was reacted with P2 allylglycine residue 5 under standard coupling procedure (EDCI, HOOBt, NMM) to provide allyl ester 7. After removal of the t-Boc protecting group of 7, the i-Boc protected cyclohexyl glycine moiety at P3 was incorporated, via 8, using the coupling conditions described earlier. Saponification of the allyl ester 9 followed by incorporation of the P02 moiety by coupling to phenylglycine amino acid derivative gave key intermediate 2 (Scheme 2). Ozonolysis of 2 generated the desired aldehyde intermediate 3 as the minor product with methoxy ketals as the major products of the reaction as established by NMR and mass spectrometry analysis. The mixture was then subjected to transketalization procedure; thus, use of Et2OÆBF3 efficiently promoted thioketal formation but unfortunately cleaved the tert-butyl ester moiety at P02 . Control of temperature, reaction time or amount of Et2OÆBF3 did not afford the desired chemoselectivity. However, the side reaction was totally eliminated by employing a milder Lewis acid for activation. Use of 1.1 equiv of zinc triflate and 2.5 equiv of 1,2-ethanedithiol afforded in <24 h the desired thioketal 10 in high yield.

Scheme 3.

Oxidation of 10 to generate the corresponding a-ketoamide 15 was rather challenging. Thus, with a stoichiometric amount of Dess­MartinÕs periodinane,10 the reaction was totally chemoselective toward the sulfide oxidation. Use of tetrapropyl ammonium perruthenate11 (TPAP) or SO3­pyridine12 complex as oxidizing reagent led mainly to degradation products. Moffatt13 oxidation furnished the desired ketoamide albeit with a M+16 adduct that was detected by mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, Swern14 oxidation of thioketal 10 provided, chemoselectively, the corresponding a-ketoamide in good yield (70%). Finally, hydrolysis of the terminal tert-butyl ester group with 50% TFA in CH2Cl2 gave the desired target 15. Compounds 16 and 17 were prepared in a similar fashion using 1,2-propanethiol and 1,2-benzenedime-thanethiol, respectively. The oxygen analogs 18 and 19 were also prepared from common intermediate 3. In the case of the oxygen analogs, transketalization was performed in the presence of molecular sieves and a catalytic amount of TsOH. Dess­MartinÕs periodinane oxidation followed by TFA deprotection of the terminal tert-butyl ester group furnished the desired a-ketoamides 18 and 19 without affecting the ketal group. P2 alkyl and cycloalkyl chain analogs 20, 21, and 22 were prepared via solid-phase synthesis8 using Sasrin resin. Inhibitor 23, bearing a cyclopropyl alanine at P2 was prepared from key intermediate 2. As described in Scheme 3, cyclopropanation of the allyl group was efficiently performed with CH2N2 and a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2.15 Dess­Martin oxidation of 14 followed by deprotection of the tert-butyl ester moiety with TFA provided 23 in high yield. 2. Results and discussion Because of the close proximity of the P2 side chain to Arg155, we anticipated that introduction of larger hydrophobic moieties off the P2 position of our inhibitors would present favorable interactions with this residue. Toward this end, we investigated replacement of leucine at P2 with more lipophilic moieties. Thus, with a K Ã of 0.12 lM, inhibitor 1 was a good candidate for i P2 optimization. HCV NS3 serine protease inhibitory activity16 for the targets synthesized was obtained using the continuous spectrophotometric assay previously reported.17 For the thioketals series, the steric factor seemed to be critical for the activity, thus, the five-membered thioketals 15 with a K Ã of 0.09 lM was more poi tent than the six-membered analog 16 ðK Ã ¼ 0.25 lMÞ. i

The aromatic ring of the benzenedimethane thioketal 17 did not provide any additional hydrophobic interaction with the enzyme backbone as demonstrated by its poorer potency ðK Ã ¼ 2.3 lMÞ. The smaller the ring, i the better was the activity; thus, compound 15, with a five-membered thioketals group, turned out to be the most potent ðK Ã ¼ 0.09 lMÞ of all the inhibitors evalui ated in this series. For the oxygenated compounds, the same trend was also observed with the five-membered ketal 18 ðK Ã ¼ 0.30 lMÞ being more potent than the i six-membered analog 19 ðK Ã ¼ 0.43 lMÞ. In the two i series evaluated, the thioketal showed better activity than the oxygen counterpart with more than 3-fold loss in activity for the five-membered ketal 18 compared to the thioketals analog 15. This was in good agreement with the hydrophobic character of sulfide versus ether and confirmed the need for a hydrophobic side chain at P2. To achieve better hydrophobic contact with Arg155, we also tried to incorporate bulkier leucine analogs at P2. From the HCV protease inhibitory data obtained for compounds 20 and 21 ðK Ã ¼ 0.31 and 0.30 lM, respeci tively) compared to compound 1 ðK Ã ¼ 0.12 lMÞ, it i was clear that steric factors were critical for activity. Incorporation of long side chains homo-leucine in 20 and homo-norleucine in 21 resulted in about 3-fold loss in activity. Although we anticipated that hydrophobic moiety should be well accommodated at this position, we noticed that larger substitutions at P2 did not provide enhancement in activity. SAR of the ketals series indicated that the smaller the size of P2 modification, the better was the activity. Using those observations, we prepared compound 22 bearing a cyclobutyl alanine moiety at P2. Inhibitor 22, with a K Ã of 0.14 lM, was i equipotent to the leucine analog 1 ðK Ã ¼ 0.12 lMÞ. i Incorporation of the smaller cyclopropyl ring in 23 resulted in more than 2-fold improvement in activity ðK Ã ¼ 0.05 lMÞ. From the X-ray analysis (Fig. 4), we i could see that the cyclopropyl ring exhibited good van der Waals contacts with the two terminal NH groups ° of Arg155. Distances were 3.52 and 3.26 A from the nearest methylene group of the ring. The Cc of Arg ° 155, the nearest methylene group, was 4.41 A from the same methylene group of the cyclopropyl ring. These observations were in good agreements with the cyclopropyl ring filling the S2 pocket in an optimum manner. Targets included in Table 1 were prepared using n-valine as the P1 residue. We carried out modifications aimed at optimizing the P1 residue by retaining cyclopropyl alanine at P2 since it had previously demonstrated

improved potency. We discovered that incorporation of a cyclopropyl alanine at P1 also provided a real boost in activity. Thus, inhibitor 24 (Fig. 3) exhibited the best potency in that series with K Ã ¼ 0.015 lM. i X-ray crystal structure of the inhibitor 24 bound to the protease is shown in Figure 5.18 It can be seen that the

peptidic core binds to the protease through a series of hydrogen bonding interactions. The cyclopropyl alanine residues at P2 and P1 fit well in the S2 and S1 pockets, respectively, making tight hydrophobic contacts. The cyclohexyl moiety at P3 provided additional hydrophobic contacts in comparison with smaller groups at P3.8 The P1 ­P02 residues form a ÔC-clampÕ that wraps over the side chain of lys136. In summary, we have identified potent inhibitors of the HCV NS3 serine protease. Incorporation of a cyclopropyl alanine side chain at both P2 and P1 improved the binding potency by about 10-fold compared to our earlier P3-capped inhibitors 1. Further work aimed at the depeptidization of 24 is under progress and will be reported shortly.
