The R- and S-R-(N2-guanyl)styrene oxide (SO) adducts at X5 in d(G1G2C3A4X5G6T7G8G9T10G11), d(C12A13C14C15A16C17C18T19G20C21C22), encompassing codon 12 of the human N-ras protooncogene (underlined), were examined using 1H NMR spectroscopy. These were the R(12,1) and S(12,1) adducts, indicating the location of the R or S adduct at the first position of codon 12. These differed from the R- and S(12,2)-R-SO adducts [Zegar, I. S., Setayesh, F. R., DeCorte, B. L., Harris, C. M., Harris, T. M., and Stone, M. P. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 4334-4348] in that the base pair 5 to the lesion was changed from G,C to A,T, while the base pair 3 to the lesion was changed from T,A to G,C. Comparison of the R- and S(12,1) adducts with the R- and S(12,2) adducts allowed the effects of flanking bases on the conformations of the R-SO adducts to be examined. This change in flanking base affected the R-SO lesion. The R(12,1) adduct structure was disordered at the adduct site, and a refined structure could not be obtained. NOE and chemical shift data suggested that the styrenyl moiety was oriented in the minor groove and in the 3-direction from the site of adduction. In contrast, this change in flanking base did not affect the S-SO lesion. The S(12,1) adduct yielded a refined structure, with the styrenyl moiety edgewise in the minor groove and oriented in the 5-direction relative to the site of adduction. A total of 232 interproton distances, including 13 styrene-DNA distances, were obtained. A total of 12 NOE-restrained molecular dynamics calculations converged with pairwise root-mean-square deviation of 1.10 Å. The sixth-root residual index between calculated and experimental NOE intensities was 8.0 × 10-2 Å. The styrene aromatic protons appeared as three resonances, suggesting rapid rotation. The possibility of a hydrogen bond between the styrene hydroxyl and C18 O2 in the S(12,1) adduct could not be confirmed. This work illustrates the dual roles of stereochemistry and sequence in modulating the properties of guanine N2 R-SO adducts.

Introduction
Styrene, a mutagen in prokaryotes (1, 2) and eukaryotes (3), has been of concern as a potential human mutagen (4-7). Indeed, adducts of styrene oxide (SO)1 were detected at the O6 position of guanine in styreneexposed lamination workers by 32P postlabeling (8, 9). This supports the notion that styrene genotoxicity results from cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism to SO (1017). This oxide reacts in vitro to form adducts at a

number of nucleophilic sites in DNA, including the Rand S-enantiomers at the exocyclic amino group of guanine (18) (Chart 1). The reaction of styrene oxides with guanosine NH2 exhibited considerable SN1 character but favored inversion of stereochemistry (19). SO induces sister chromosome exchange and aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro (20, 21). Styrene oxide was suggested to be a weak mutagen at the hprt locus in peripheral blood lymphocytes, which correlated with increased levels of the guanine O6 adduct, a biomarker of styrene exposure (22). Molecular analysis of the hprt mutations suggested that they occurred at both guanine and adenine sites and were predominantly base pair substitutions (23). We have focused attention on the R- and S-R-SO adducts located at the exocyclic amino groups of guanines in the codon 12 sequence of the human N-ras protooncogene, a site at which mutations are linked to oncogene activation.

from restrained MD simulation incorporating simulated annealing, followed by full relaxation matrix backcalculation (26). The resulting structure was quite similar to the corresponding S(12,2) adduct (25). Changing the 5-neighbor base pair from A,T to G,C had little effect.

Experimental Procedures
Materials. d(CACCACCTGCC) was purchased from the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Site-specific incorporation of styrene into the ras12 sequence was accomplished by reaction of the enantiomeric phenylglycinols with the ras12 oligodeoxynucleotide containing 2-fluoroinosine deoxyriboside at the target site. This enabled large-scale production of R- and S-R-(N2-guanyl)styrene oxide-adducted oligodeoxynucleotides (27). The modified oligodeoxynucleotides were purified by reverse-phase semipreparative HPLC (PRP-1; Hamilton Co., Reno, NV) in 10 mM ethylenediamine acetate (pH 7.0). Oligodeoxynucleotides eluted using a gradient of 0-20% acetonitrile in 20 min. The DNA was desalted on Sephadex G-25 (Pharmacia-P. L Biochemicals, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The concentration of d(GGCAGGTGGTG) was calculated from the extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 1.09 × 105 M-1 cm-1, while concentrations of d(GGCAR-SOGGTGGTG) and d(GGCAS-SOGGTGGTG) were calculated from the extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 9.24 × 104 M-1 cm-1 (28). Complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed at approximately equal molar ratios in 10 mM NaH2PO4, 0.1 M NaCl, and 50 µM Na2EDTA, at pH 6.9. After heating to 85 °C for 5 min, cooling to room temperature annealed the strands. DNA Grade Bio-Gel hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA) (15 cm × 3.0 cm), eluted with a NaH2PO4 gradient from 10 to 200 mM (pH 6.9), separated double- from single-stranded DNA. The duplexes were desalted on Sephadex G-25 (70 cm × 1.5 cm). The samples were dissolved in 0.5 mL of NMR buffer [0.1 M NaCl, 5 × 10-5 M Na2EDTA, 0.01 M NaH2PO4 (pH 6.9)]. The samples were 2.5 mM in strand concentration. NMR. Spectra were recorded at 1H frequencies of 500.13 and 750.13 MHz. Spectra were referenced to the water resonance at 4.72 ppm at 30 °C, or at 4.97 ppm at 10 °C. Phase-sensitive NOESY spectra used for resonance assignment were recorded using TPPI phase cycling. A mixing time of 400 ms was used. In the d1 dimension, 1024 real data points were collected, with 32 acquisitions per FID with a 1.5-s relaxation delay; 2048 real data points were used in the d2 dimension. The residual water resonance was saturated during the relaxation delay and the mixing period. Data were zero-filled in the d1 dimension to give a 2K × 2K real matrix. A sine bell apodization function with a 90° phase shift and a skew factor of 0.7 was used in the d1 and d2 dimensions. Phase-sensitive NOESY experiments in 9:1 H2O/D2O at 10 °C were performed using a jump return 1-1 sequence for water suppression as the read pulse (29, 30).

oligodeoxynucleotide (25) revealed the influence of stereochemistry in determining the orientation of R-SO adducts at guanine N2, with the R-diastereomer being oriented in the 3-direction while the S-diastereomer was oriented in the 5-direction from the lesion site. That work suggested the potential for flanking base effects upon the R-SO and S-SO adduct minor groove adducts in the ras12 sequence. The R- and S(12,1)-R-SO adducts differed from the R- and S(12,2)-R-SO adducts in that the base pair 5 to the SO lesion was changed from G,C to A,T, while the base pair 3 to the lesion was changed from T,A to G,C (Chart 2). If flanking sequences modulated adduct behavior, one might predict that changing the 3-neighbor base from T to G should affect the R-SO adduct oriented in the 3-direction, i.e., R(12,1) vs R(12,2). On the other hand, changing the identity of the 5-neighbor nucleotide might impact the S-SO adduct oriented in the 5-direction, i.e., S(12,1) vs S(12,2). The present NMR data lead to the conclusion that the R(12,1) and S(12,2) adducts remain in the minor groove, oriented in the 3- and 5-directions, respectively. In this respect, they are similar to the R- and S(12,2) adducts which were examined previously (25). However, the data reveal a 3-flanking sequence effect which perturbs the R-SO adduct. The R(12,1) adduct is disordered relative to the R(12,2) adduct to the extent that it is not possible to refine a structure. In contrast, this change in 5flanking sequence does not affect the S-SO adduct. For the S(12,1) adduct, the conformation was determined

Convolution difference during processing minimized the residual water signal (31). The NOE mixing time was 250 ms. In the d1 dimension, 512 data points were collected, with 64 scans per FID; the relaxation delay was 1.5 s. In the d2 dimension, 2K data points were utilized. For distance measurements, NOESY spectra at mixing times of 150, 250, and 350 ms were acquired. To eliminate artifacts arising from zero-quantum coherence and zz terms, a systematically shifted composite 180° pulse was implemented within the mixing period, and composite 90° pulses were used in place of the second and third 90° pulses in the standard NOESY pulse sequence (32). The data were transferred to Indigo workstations (Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and processed using FELIX (Biosym Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA). Distance Restraints. NOE intensities were determined by volume integration of cross-peaks using FELIX. These were combined as necessary with intensities generated from relaxation matrix analysis of a model structure to generate a hybrid intensity matrix. MARDIGRAS (33) iteratively refined the hybrid matrix to optimize the agreement with experimental NOE intensities. Volumes measured from three NOESY experiments at 150-, 250-, and 350-ms mixing times and correlation times of 3, 4, and 5 ns yielded nine sets of internuclear distances. These data were pooled; average values of all minimum and maximum distances were used in setting error bounds to give the experimental NOE restraints used in subsequent molecular dynamics calculations (26). Molecular Dynamics and Simulated Annealing. INSIGHTII was used to build starting structures and for molecular visualization. The starting structures IniA and IniB were constructed by bonding C1 of styrene to N2 of guanine in either B-DNA or A-DNA (34) reference structures, followed by 500 iterations of potential energy minimization using conjugate gradients. Potential energy minimization and restrained MD calculations were performed using X-PLOR (35), derived from CHARMM (36) and adapted for restrained MD calculations of nucleic acids. The empirical energy function (37) treated hydrogens explicitly. The van der Waals energy term was approximated using the Lennard-Jones potential energy function. The electrostatic term used the Coulomb function, based on full partial charges and a distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4. The nonbonded pair list was updated if any atom moved more than 0.5 Å, and the cutoff radius for nonbonded interactions was 11 Å. The effective energy function was composed of two terms describing distance and dihedral restraints, which were square well potentials (38). Bond lengths involving hydrogen were kept fixed with the SHAKE algorithm (39) during MD calculations. Calculations were performed in vacuo without explicit counterions. The integration time step used in the molecular dynamics calculations was 1 fs. Structure coordinates were archived every 0.1 ps. Back-calculation of NMR data was performed using CORMA (40). The refined structures were analyzed using DIALS AND WINDOWS 1.0 (41).

Results
Spectral Assignments. (a) The R(12,1) Adduct. The spectrum of the aromatic-to-anomeric NOEs used in sequential assignments, obtained at 750 MHz, was complex, with G1 and G2 H8, G11 and G20 H8, C3 and C14 H6, C18 and T19 H6, and C15 and C21 H6 partially overlapping in the 1D spectrum. Considerable overlap was observed in the 2D data as well (Figure 1). In the modified strand, a complete set of sequential NOE connectivities was observed, but two NOEs were weak. These were the intranucleotide connectivity G6 H8 f G6 H1 and the internucleotide connectivity G6 H1 f T7 H6. This was a consequence of the broadening of the G6 H1 resonance. All expected NOE connectivities were observed for the complementary strand.

In the imino region of the spectrum, the resonance at 13.9 ppm was assigned to T19 N3H from a cross-peak to A4 H2 (Figure 2). The resonance at 13.3 ppm was assigned to T7 N3H from a cross-peak to A16 H2. T10 N3H was broad but was identified on the basis of a cross-peak to A13 H2. The imino resonances of the terminal nucleotides, G1 and G11 N1H, were exchange-broadened. G6 N1H was assigned on the basis of a cross-peak to C17 CH6. A weak NOE was observed between G6 N1H and R-SOG5 N1H. The imino protons of G8, G9, and G20 were identified on the basis of NOEs to amino protons from the complementary cytosines, C15, C14, and C3, respectively. T19 N3H showed a cross-peak to a resonance at 14 ppm, tentatively assigned as an exchange peak. The latter exhibited cross-peaks to resonances at 7.42 and 12.7 ppm, which were tentatively assigned to the A4 H2 and R-SOG5 N1H resonances in an unidentified second conformation. The assignments for the R(12,1) oligomer are compiled in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. (b) The S(12,1) Adduct. Spectral overlap involved G1, G2, and G6, and S-SOG5 H8, and C22 H6, which overlapped, as did C3, C14, and T19 H6, and C15, C18, and C21 H6. The cytosine H5 and H6 protons were clustered between 5.25 and 5.97 ppm and 7.26 and 7.70 ppm, with C12 H5 and H6 (the 5-terminal base of the complementary strand) located downfield of the other cytosines. As for the R(12,1) adduct, considerable spectral overlap remained in the 2D spectrum (Figure 1). No interruptions were observed in the expected pattern of NOEs for either the adducted or the complementary strands. The assignments for the S(12,1) oligomer are compiled in Table S2 in the Supporting Information. Three well-resolved imino resonances observed between 13.5 and 14.2 ppm (Figure 2) were assigned to T7, T10, and T19 N3H from cross-peaks to the H2 protons of the complementary adenines. The resonances located between 12.6 and 13.1 ppm were identified as guanine N1H protons. G1 and G11 N1H were exchange-broadened. The imino proton resonances of S-SOG5 and G6 overlapped but were identified on the basis of NOEs to amino protons of the complementary cytosines, C17 and C18, respectively. The imino proton resonances of G8, G9, and G20 were also overlapped but were also identified on the basis of NOEs to amino protons of the complementary cytosines, C18, C14, and C3, respectively. Styrene Protons. (a) The R(12,1) Adduct. A crosspeak between resonances at 3.65 and 3.70 ppm and a resonance at 4.98 ppm identified the methylene and benzylic protons, respectively (Figure 3). The styrene ring protons were observed as three resonances. At 750 MHz, the benzylic proton, Hb, showed a cross-peak to a resonance at 7.49 ppm, which was assigned to Ho,o. Likewise, Ho,o showed a NOE with a resonance at  7.47 ppm and a weak NOE with a resonance at 7.40 ppm. These were assigned as Hm,m and Hp. NOEs were also observed between Hm,m and Hp, Ho,o and Hp, Ho,o and the methylene protons, and between Hm,m and Hb. (b) The S(12,1) Adduct. The resonance at 4.33 ppm was assigned to Hb since it showed a strong NOE to the methylene protons of the CH2OH group in both TOCSY and NOESY spectra (Figure 3). The methylene protons were located at 3.67 and 3.76 ppm. The styrene ring protons were observed as three resonances. The benzylic proton exhibited a strong NOE with the peak at 7.33 ppm. Since only one strong cross-peak was observed between Hb and the resonance at 7.33 ppm, Ho and Ho

were overlapped. A second-order NOE was observed between the ortho protons and the methylene protons. The resonance at 7.35 ppm was assigned to Hm,m since it exhibited a cross-peak in the COSY spectrum with the resonance at 7.33 ppm. This resonance also showed a through-bond cross-peak with the peak at 7.26 ppm in the COSY spectrum, which was assigned as Hp. NOEs were observed between Hm,m and Hp, and Ho,o and Hp, respectively. Styrene-DNA Connectivities. (a) The R(12,1) Adduct. NOEs between the styrene protons and the nonexchangeable and exchangeable DNA protons established the orientation of the SO phenyl ring relative to R-SOG5 (Figure 4). These were between styrenyl protons and minor groove DNA protons. The methylene protons of SO exhibited NOEs to A4 H2 and T19 H1. T7 H4, H5, and H5 showed NOEs with Hp. NOEs were also observed between Ho,o and G6 and C18 H1 and between Hm,m and C18 H1. NOEs were observed between SO H , "

and R-SOG5 N1H and R-SOG5 N2H. The benzylic proton showed NOEs with R-SOG5 N1H and G6 N1H. The Ho,o protons also showed a NOE with R-SOG5 N1H. The NOEs to the G6 N1H resonance were probably second-order. (b) The S(12,1) Adduct. A total of 30 NOE crosspeaks were identified between styrene oxide and exchangeable and nonexchangeable DNA protons (Figure 4). Cross-peaks were observed between both H  and H  and G6 H1. Hb had NOEs with S-SOG5 H1 and G6 H1. Of the aromatic protons, Ho,o showed NOEs to G6 H4, S-SOG5 H1, T19 H1, G6 H1, G20 H1, and A4 H2. The Hm,m resonances showed NOEs to G6 H4, S-SOG5 H1, T19 H1, G20 H1, and A4 H2. Finally, Hp showed a weak NOE to A4 H2. Cross-peaks were observed between H ,  and S-SOG5 N1H and N2H. H showed cross-peaks to S-SOG5 b N1H and S-SOG5 N2H. The Ho,o protons showed strong NOEs to S-SOG5 N1H, and S-SOG5 N2H. These NOEs established the 5-orientation of the SO phenyl ring relative to S-SOG5.

Chemical Shift Perturbations. (a) The R(12,1) Adduct. The greatest changes in chemical shifts were observed for G6 (Figure 5), in the 3-direction from the adduct site. Upfield chemical shifts of 0.3, 0.6, and 0.5 ppm were observed for G6 H8, H1, and H2, respectively, relative to the unmodified oligomer (24). Also, a 0.4 ppm downfield chemical shift was noted for R-SOG5 H1. No large chemical shift perturbations were observed for the complementary strand. (b) The S(12,1) Adduct. Changes in the chemical shifts were observed for the sugar protons of the bases at or 5 to the site of the lesion in the minor groove (Figure 5). These included A4 H1and H2 which shifted by 0.4 and 0.35 ppm, respectively, G6 H1 which shifted downfield by 0.4 ppm, and C18 H1 and H2" which shifted

downfield by 0.3 ppm. In the major groove, G6 H8 experienced a downfield shift by 0.3 ppm. As compared to the unmodified ras12 DNA, an upfield shift of 0.2 ppm was observed for S-SOG5 N1H. Structure Refinement. (a) The R(12,1) Adduct. A total of 145 intranucleotide restraints, 64 internucleotide restraints, and 10 styrene-DNA restraints were used. Convergence to similar structures as measured by rootmean-square deviation was achieved. There was reasonable agreement between the experimental and theoretical NOE intensities at base pairs further removed from the lesion site, as determined from CORMA calculations (40). Thus, base pairs G1,C22 f C3,G20 and G8,C15 f G11,C12 were reasonably well-defined in the emergent structures. However, at the lesion site, and at the adjacent base

pairs, back-calculation of theoretical NOE intensities from the calculated structures revealed that the latter were not in good agreement with the NOE data. This was evidenced by sixth-root residuals as large as 40 × 10-2. (b) The S(12,1) Adduct. The restraints consisted of 140 intranucleotide, 79 internucleotide, and 13 styreneDNA distances. An average of 11 intranucleotide, internucleotide, and empirical distances were obtained for each base pair; their distribution is summarized in Table 1. The NOEs observed between the ortho and meta protons of the styrene ring represented time-averaged values over o,o and m,m positions. The assumption was made that in each case, the observed NOE resulted from

only one (i.e., o or o, m or m) position. The assignment of specific NOEs to o, o, m, or m was made by inspection of the IniB structures built with the SO phenyl ring oriented in the 5-direction from S-SOG5. Consequently, the styrene-DNA restraints were less-defined, and larger bounds were placed on them. Table S2 in the Supporting Information shows a list of the NOE-generated distances along with the upper and lower bounds assigned to them by MARDIGRAS. Figure 6 shows the convergence of the final structures obtained by averaging the six IniA-based and six IniBbased structures, followed by PEM (rMDA and rMDB). A space-filling model of the S(12,1) adduct is shown in Figure 7. Table 1 shows the results of pairwise rmsd

comparisons between the emergent structures. That the final structures converged to a more B-like conformation was evidenced by the large rmsd between IniA and rMDA as compared to the smaller rmsd between IniB and rMDB. Excluding the terminal bases, the average rmsd between the rMDA and rMDB structures was 1.1 Å. IniA- and IniB-based MD calculations performed in the absence of the NOE restraints did not converge, which indicated that the convergence to the final structures was due to the NOE distance restraints.

Calculation of theoretical NOE intensities from the refined structures was performed using CORMA (40). Table 2 shows sixth-root R1x factors calculated for the starting structures and the MD structures, calculated at three values of NOE mixing time. IniA was inconsistent with the data, having R1x of 15 × 10-2, while IniB showed a significantly lower R1x of 8 × 10-2. At each value of NOE mixing time, structures calculated from IniA exhibited improved R1x values compared to the set of structures calculated from IniB, consistent with the S(12,2) adduct (25).

Discussion
Active oncogenes found in a number of human tumors (42-45) often are members of the ras protooncogene family (46, 47). Activation of ras is a consequence of mutations within a limited number of codons of the gene product, including codon 12 (48). This work extends structural studies of the R- and S-R-styrene adducts at guanine N2 in the codon 12 sequence of the N-ras protooncogene. It seems reasonable that to the extent the R- and S-R-SO adducts are formed within codon 12, they might induce mutations which would be expected to activate this protooncogene. When located at the second guanine in the ras12 sequence [the (12,2) position] the R- and S-diastereomers were in the minor groove and oriented either in the 5-direction in the case of the S-SO adduct or in the 3-direction in the case of the R-SO adduct, from the site of adduction. The present results reveal similarities upon moving the R- and S-SO adducts one nucleotide upstream to the (12,1) position: the adducts remain located in the minor groove and with the same relative 5- or 3-orientations as a function of stereochemistry. Simultaneously, the results reveal the potential for flanking base effects to modulate the behavior of these adducts in duplex DNA. Overall Features. (a) The R(12,1) Adduct. The inability to refine a structure, and the 5 °C lower Tm of this sample, as compared to the S(12,1) adduct, suggested that at and adjacent to the adduct site, this oligodeoxynucleotide duplex was disordered. NOE and chemical shift data indicated that styrene ring was in the minor groove and oriented in the 3-direction. The upfield chemical shifts of 0.5 and 0.35 ppm of minor groove protons G6 H1 and H2, in the 3-direction, were judged to be due to ring current shielding effects of the styrene ring. This conclusion was supported by NOEs between the methylene protons of SO in the 5-direction, to A4 H2 and T19 H1, Hp and T7 H4, H5, and H5, and between Ho,o and G6 and C18 H1. Large chemical shift changes were not observed in the imino region of the spectrum, consistent with the conclusion that Watson-Crick base pairing was not disturbed. The 3-orientation was reminiscent of the R(12,2) adduct (25) and for the C10 R stereoisomer of the (-)-anti-trans-benzo[a]pyrene adduct at guanine N2 (49, 50).

(b) The S(12,1) Adduct. This adduct yielded a refined solution structure, which was similar to the corresponding S(12,2) adduct (25). Styrene was located in the minor groove, and the ring was oriented edgewise toward the 5-direction as evidenced by the chemical shifts of nearby protons and the pattern of NOEs between the DNA and the styrene moiety. The pattern and intensity of intra- and internucleotide NOEs revealed a right-handed helix. All of the deoxyribose moieties adopted the anti conformation. Watson-Crick base pairing in the vicinity of the lesion site remained intact as judged from the observed imino-imino NOE patterns. The 0.4 and 0.35 ppm upfield shifts of minor groove protons A4 H1 and H2 and the 0.6 ppm downfield shifts of G6 H1 were judged to be due to ring current effects. The origin of the 0.30 ppm downfield shift of C18 H1 and H2 was not determined. The styrene ring rotated rapidly on the NMR time scale at 30 °C, analogous to rapid ring flips of phenylalanine and tyrosine resonances within proteins (51). This contrasted with two major groove R-R-(N6-adenyl)styrene oxide adducts, which displayed slow rotation of the styrene phenyl ring (52). No evidence was observed for rotation of the adduct about the guanyl N2-CR bond that would interchange the orientation of the styrene ring within the major groove between the 3- and 5-directions. The refinement suggested hydrogen bonding could occur between T19 O2 and the hydroxyl group, although this potential hydrogen bond was not observed spectroscopically. The inability to observe this hydrogen bond was not unexpected as it was likely to undergo rapid exchange with solvent. Flanking Base Effect. Comparison of the R- and S(12,1) adduct data with that previously obtained for the R- and S(12,2) adducts (25) revealed a 3-flanking base pair effect on the R(12,1) and R(12,2) minor groove adducts. The change from a G,C 3-neighbor base pair in the R(12,1) adduct to a T,A 3-neighbor base pair in the R(12,2) adduct affected the relative behavior of the two 3-oriented R-SO adducts. In comparing these two adducts, the R(12,1) adduct exhibited a 5 °C lower Tm and was disordered. In contrast, the change from an A, T to a G,C 5-neighbor base pair made little difference in the relative behavior of the two 5-oriented S-SO adducts. The S(12,1) and S(12,2) adducts exhibited similar Tm values, and both yielded similar refined solution structures. Precedence for flanking base effects modulating adduct properties at guanine N2 comes from 7R,8S,9R,10S-[BP]N2-dG benzo[a]pyrene adduct, which corresponds stereochemically to the S-SO adduct examined in this work. Flanking base effects on 10S-[BP] adducts were inferred from comparison of NMR data from several laboratories

(53) and from fluorescence spectroscopy (54). The 10S[BP] adduct was initially examined by NMR in the 5CXC-3 sequence (49, 50) and subsequently in the 5-TXC3 (55) sequence. In the first sequence, a single structure was obtained, in which the PAH lesion was oriented 5 in the minor groove, whereas in the second sequence, two forms were in equilibrium, one of which was a 5-minor groove structure; the other was proposed to be intercalated. The 10S-[BP] adduct in the 5-TXT-3 sequence context was disordered such that it was not possible to obtain a structure (56). It was proposed that the flanking pair on the 5-side modulated the properties of the 10S[BP] adduct (53, 56). The basis for that argument was that a less stable A,T flanking base pair as compared to a G,C flanking base pair provided greater "local flexibility". The present results argue that the "local flexibility" model (53, 56) does not extend to the R- and S-SO adducts. For the S-SO adducts, changing the 5-neighbor base pair from G,C to A,T had negligible effect on adduct structure; "local flexibility" would have predicted the S(12,1) adduct to have lower Tm and a less-ordered solution structure than the S(12,2) adduct. The disordered R(12,1) adduct, for which the 3-neighbor was G, C, exhibited a lower Tm than did the R(12,2) adduct, for which the 3-neighbor was T,A. Thus, the origin of the flanking base effect observed in this work remains to be determined; it differs from the flanking base effect observed for 7R,8S,9R,10S-[BP]-N2-dG benzo[a]pyrene adduct (53). However, the limited amount of structural data available for either the BP or the SO adducts in

duplex DNA makes it premature to determine whether there exist flanking base effects which are shared by both classes of adducts. We suspect that the present flanking base effect may arise as a consequence of incompletely characterized adduct-induced alterations in "nearest-neighbor" base stacking, and not from alterations in hydrogen bonding. The importance of nearest-neighbor stacking effects in modulating the thermal stabilities of sequence-isomeric oligoribonucleotides (57-59) and deoxyribonucleotides (60) has been appreciated. Figure 8 shows the results of a molecular modeling study of the R(12,1) adduct, in which the styrene moiety was oriented in the 3-direction from the site of adduction. The 3-neighbor G,C base pair inserts the guanine exocyclic NH2 group into the minor groove; thus, accommodation of the styrenyl moiety within the minor groove and in the 3-direction requires a shift in base stacking at the adduct site. Modeling suggests that the modified base pair R-SOG,C shifts toward the minor groove as compared to the corresponding G,C base pair in the unmodified ras12 oligodeoxynucleotide (24). In contrast, with the R(12,2) adduct, the 3-neighbor T,A base pair does not hinder accommodation of the styrenyl moiety within the minor groove and in the 3-direction. The refined structure for this adduct (25) does not predict a corresponding shift in base stacking interactions at the lesion site. The nearest-neighbor base-stacking model potentially explains the absence of a flanking sequence effect for the two S-SO adducts. The stacking patterns calculated for S-SOG5,C18, its 5-neighbor A4,T19, and its 3-neighbor G6,

Figure 9. Stacking patterns as indicated by the refined NMR structure of (A) A4,T19 above G5,C18 in the ras12 duplex, (B) A4,T19 above S-SOG5,C18 in the S(12,1) adduct, (C) G5,C18 above G6,C17 in the ras12 duplex, (D) S-SOG5,C18 above G6,C17 in the S(12,1) adduct, and (E) minor groove view of A4,T19 above S-SOG5,C18 above G6,C17 in the S(12,1) duplex.

C17 as compared to A4,T19, G5,C18, and G6,C17 in the unmodified ras12 sequence suggested that the presence of SO did not induce large alterations in the B-type helix or the patterns of base pairing and stacking near the lesion (Figure 9). Minor groove width was not altered when compared to the unmodified DNA. The structural calculations for the S-SOG adducts predict that the presence or absence of the guanine exocyclic NH2 group in the minor groove on the 5-side of the S-SOG adduct is of less consequence as compared to its presence or absence on the 3-side of R-SOG adducts. The righthanded helical pitch of B-DNA relative to the adduct site allows the 5-oriented S-SOG lesion to be easily accommodated within the minor groove in the presence of either the 5-flanking T,A base pair (Figure 9) or the 5-flanking G,C base pair (25). Thus, the S(12,1)- and S(12,2)-R-SO adducts have similar Tm values (measured as 62 °C vs 63 °C) and similar solution conformations. Biological Implications. One assumption implicit in relating adduct structure in duplex oligodeoxynucleotides to mutagenesis is that the duplex provides a reasonable model for the primer-template replication complex. The extent to which this assumption is valid in the case of the R- and S-SO adducts has not been determined. Nevertheless, the idea that sequencespecific differences in adduct conformation might generate differential mutagenic outcomes has been of considerable interest. At the exocyclic NH2 position of guanosine, evidence to support this hypothesis has been observed

for the mutagenic spectrum of the 7R,8S,9R,10S-[BP]N2-dG benzo[a]pyrene lesion (61). There existed a correlation between differing adduct structures (53) and the mutagenic spectrum of this benzo[a]pyrene adduct (61), although specific structure-function relationships remain incompletely understood. It will be of interest to compare the mutagenic spectra induced by the R- and S(12,1)- and R- and S(12,2)-R-SO adducts. The present results predict that the S(12,1) and S(12,2) adducts might produce a similar mutagenic spectrum, with the possibility that the R(12,1) and R(12,2) adducts might induce different outcomes. The ability of replication complexes to bypass the damage site is one factor which may contribute toward determining the fate of potential SO guanine N2 adducts (62-64). Primer extension studies using HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, Klenow fragment (exo- and exo+), Sequenase 2.0, T4 holoenzyme, and human polymerases R and revealed that the R(12,2) and S(12,2) adducts (25) blocked trans-lesion polymerization opposite and one base 3 to the lesion.3 Biochemical studies suggested that the R- and S-R-SO adducts interfere with the proper functioning of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by disruption of contacts between R-helix H and the minor groove (65). It will be of interest to determine whether the sequencedependent conformational differences observed in this work will be reflected in the processing of the R(12,1) and S(12,1) adducts by DNA polymerases.

Summary
The solution structures of the R- and S(12,1)-R-SO adducts in the ras12 oligodeoxynucleotide were examined. The R(12,1) adduct was disordered. It was not possible to obtain a refined structure, although the data suggested that the styrenyl moiety was oriented in the 3-direction. The S(12,1) adduct was accommodated within the minor groove. The orientation of the styrenyl moiety was in the 5-direction. When compared to data obtained for the R- and S(12,2)-R-SO adducts (25), a 3flanking base effect was observed for the R-SO adduct, but not for the S-SO adduct. This work provides evidence for the dual roles of stereochemistry and DNA sequence in modulating the conformational properties of guanine N2 R-SO adducts.
