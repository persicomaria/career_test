Abstract The penicillin G acylase (PGA) and cephalosporin acylase (CA) families, which are members of the N-terminal (Ntn) hydrolases, are valuable for the production of backbone chemicals like 6-aminopenicillanic acid and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), which can be used to synthesize semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins, respectively. Regardless of the low sequence similarity between PGA and CA, the structural homologies at their active-sites are very high. However, despite this structural conservation, they catalyze very different substrates. PGA reacts with the hydrophobic aromatic side-chain (the phenylacetyl moiety) of penicillin G (PG), whereas CA targets the hydrophilic linear side-chain (the glutaryl moiety) of glutaryl-7-ACA (GL-7-ACA). These different substrate specificities are likely to be due to differences in the side-chains of the active-site residues. In this study, mutagenesis of active-site residues binding the side-chain moiety of PG changed the substrate specificity of PGA to that of CA. This mutant PGA may constitute an alternative source of engineered enzymes for the industrial production of 7-ACA. Ó 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N-terminal (Ntn) hydrolases form a novel class of hydrolytic enzymes that are activated through the transformation of an inactive precursor polypeptide by auto-proteolytic processing, which generates a new Nterminal residue [1,2]. There are five known families of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily: penicillin G acylase, penicillin V acylase, class II glutamine amidotransferases, proteasome b subunit, and glycosylasparaginase [2]. Recently, it was proposed that cephalosporin acylases belong to one family of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily [3]. Both the penicillin G acylase (PGA) and the cephalosporin acylase (CA) families of the Ntn hydrolase superfamily can be used to produce valuable backbone chemicals, such as, 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), and 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), respectively, for the synthesis of semi-synthetic penicillins and

cephalosporins (Fig. 1) [4]. In the pharmaceutical industry, penicillin G (PG), the raw chemical of 6-APA is produced by bulk fermentation in the same manner as cephalosporin C (CPC), the raw chemical of 7-ACA. PG is subsequently converted to 6-APA by PGA, which is then used to synthesize semi-synthetic penicillin antibiotics [3,4]. In contrast, the production of 7-ACA is carried out in the pharmaceutical industry mostly by chemical methods, which are dependent on toxic compounds. Therefore, the possibility of being able to convert CPC to 7-ACA enzymatically is of great interest to cephalosporin antibiotic manufacturers [4,5] The biggest problems of enzymatic industrial production are that cephalosporin acylase (CA) requires glutaryl-7-ACA (GL-7-ACA) as a primary substrate and that its specificity for CPC is too low to allow the industrial production of 7-ACA (Fig. 1) [4,6]. The structures of PGA were determined with several substrate analogs [7,8]. In addition, the structures of

Fig. 1. Deacylation reactions of penicillin G acylase and cephalosporin acylase. The major reactions of PGA and CA are the conversion of PG to 6-APA and GL-7-ACA to 7-ACA, respectively. The activities of PGA and CA in their respective conversions of GL-7-ACA to 7-ACA and CPC to 7-ACA (minor reactions) are poor, compared to their activities of the major reactions (Table 2) [4,6]. The elements determining substrate specificity are the side-chain moieties of GL-7-ACA, CPC, and PG, which are glutaryl-, a-aminoadipyl-, and phenylacetyl-moieties, respectively [4].

class I CA from Pseudomonas diminuta (CAD) in complex with GL-7-ACA (the most favored substrate of all five CA classes) and glutarate (a side-chain moiety of GL-7-ACA, which determines the substrate specificity of CA) were determined [3,4,9]. Even though the primary sequence of Escherichia coli PGA is only 23% identical to CAD, the residues forming the side-chain binding pocket in CAD well match the corresponding residues at the PGA active-site [3]. Thus, it was proposed that the general topology and the structural conformation of the active-site might be conserved throughout the PGA family and throughout all four classes of CAs [3,10]. Despite the structural similarities of the active-sites in PGA and CAD, they catalyze substrates with very different shapes: PGA converts a substrate that carries a bulky hydrophobic phenylacetyl side-chain, whereas CAD reacts with linear hydrophilic glutaryl or a-aminoadipyl side-chains of a substrate (Fig. 1) [4,6]. Moreover, PGA deacylates GL-7-ACA poorly, and conversely CAs have very low activity for penicillins (Fig. 1, Table 1) [3,9]. It has also been proposed that the two fused b-lactam rings of the substrates (PG and GL7-ACA) are not the dominant elements for substrate binding [4,11]. The different substrate specificities of PGA and CA have been attributed to differences in the side-chain binding pockets of their active-sites [3,7]. This prompted us to mutate the residues that form the side-chain binding pocket of PGA to the corresponding residues of CAD, and this resulted in a PGA mutant with a substrate specificity similar to that of CA. Hopefully, such

engineered PGAs might produce an alternative source of mutant enzymes for the industrial production of 7-ACA from CPC. The current report represents a starting point, from which efforts can be made to develop such engineered PGAs.

Materials and methods
Site-directed mutagenesis of PGA. PGA mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using an overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The right-sized PCR fragment DNAs were ligated into modified pTrcHis2B vector (Invitrogen, USA). These modifications included the insertion of a Shine­Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) and an EcoRI site between the termination codon (TGA)

of the 209-residue a-subunit and the initiation codon (ATG) of the 567-residue b-subunit. A C-terminal 6Â His tag was attached to the end of the b-subunit for Ni2þ -affinity purification purposes. The modified pTrcHis2B vector is shown in Fig. 2. The PGA gene on the pTrcHis2B vector was transformed into an E. coli TOP10 host cell for further subcloning. The original PGA gene was kindly provided by Dr. H.S. Kang (Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea) [12]. All of the DNA manipulations were performed using standard techniques [13]. All mutant genes were sequenced using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI 3730, Applied Biosystems, USA) to confirm the correct incorporation of the targeted mutations and to ensure that no other changes had occurred. The DNA template of the first mutant PGA (V56bR) was wild-type PGA and the resulting mutated DNA was used for subsequent cumulative mutation. Expression of mutant PGA proteins. E. coli TOP10 host cells in LB medium, harboring the pTrcHis2B plasmid, were cultured at 37 °C, 250 rpm with 30 lg/ml kanamycin until the OD at 600 nm reached 0.5, and then 0.5 mM IPTG was added to the culture, which was maintained at 21 °C for 12 h for protein production. A crude cell extract was then prepared by sonication and centrifuged at 15,000g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatant was then subjected to Ni2þ ­NTA resin (Qiagen, USA), which had been previously equilibrated with an equilibration buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0), for affinity chromatography. The mutant PGA protein was eluted with a linear gradient of from 100 to 300 mM imidazole saturated in equilibration buffer, and the eluted protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration to an appropriate concentration. The purification scheme is shown in Fig. 3. Assay of deacylation activity for penicillin G and glutaryl-7-ACA. The deacylation activity of the mutant PGAs was determined using a colorimetric method using p-dimethyl aminobenzaldehyde, as previously described [14,15]. The reaction mixture consisted of 100 ll reaction buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and 1% (w/v) GL-7-ACA or PG as the substrate) and 100 ll reaction buffer without the substrate containing 75 lg PGA mutant. The assay reaction was carried out for 20 min to measure the specific activity (lmolproduct /lmolprotein /min) of deacylation for mutant PGA, and then the assay mixture was transferred into 700 ll stop solution (a mixture of acetic acid and 0.25 M NaOH in a 2:1 ratio) and centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was mixed with 100 ll of 5% (w/v) p-dimethyl aminobenzaldehyde in

methanol, and its absorbance was measured at 415 nm. Protein concentration was pre-determined using the Bradford assay (Sigma, USA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.

Results and discussion Structural homology between PGA and CAD The Ca atoms of the 61 residues forming the activesite clefts in PGA and CAD, where the secondary structural elements of PGA and CAD are conserved,  were superimposed within 1.38 A. The 11 active-site residues of PGA were well matched to the corresponding sites of CAD (Table 1, Fig. 4) [3]. The four residues used for chemical catalysis in PGA (Ser1b, Gln23b, Ala69b, and Asn241b) were found to be perfectly conserved in CAD (Ser1b, His23b, Val70b, and Asn244b) in terms of their roles [4]. The other seven residues (Phe146a, Phe24b, Thr32b, Pro49b, Val56b, Trp154b, and Ile177b) defining the hydrophobic side-chain binding pocket in PGA were also found to be well matched to the seven structurally aligned residues (Tyr149a, Leu24b, Tyr33b, Gln50b, Arg57b, Tyr153b, and Phe177b) of CAD. Two of these residues in PGA, i.e., Pro49b and Val56b, are hydrophobic, whereas the corresponding residues in CAD (Gln50b and Arg57b) are hydrophilic. This dissemblance might be at least partially responsible for the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. The side-chain moieties of CAD substrates, such as glutaryl or a-aminoadipyl moieties, are negatively charged and must fit the side-chain binding pocket, where Gln50b and Arg57b probably stabilize these negatively charged moieties. However, the favored substrate of PGA, penicillin G, includes a

The 11 residues (Table 1) participating in chemical catalysis and the formation of a side-chain binding pocket in the active-site are shown, respectively [3,4]. The Ca atoms of the 61 residues involved in forming the active-site cleft that include the  11 residues shown were superimposed within 1.38 A [3]. The secondary structures of PGA and CAD are mostly conserved. The Ca traces of the aand b-subunits of CAD are colored green and purple, respectively, and the a- and b-subunits of PGA are shown in light-green and light-purple, respectively.

hydrophobic phenylacetyl side-chain, and thus that CAD cannot accommodate it as a substrate [4]. It seems that the difference in the substrate specificities of PGA and CAD might be due to differences in the active-site residues forming the side-chain binding pocket [4]. This prompted us to mutate the seven residues in the side-chain binding pocket of the PGA activesite. Six residues (Tyr149a, Leu24b, Tyr33b, Gln50b, Arg57b, and Phe177b) in the side-chain binding pocket of the CAD active-site interact closely with its substrate, GL-7-ACA [4], and thus, critically determine substrate specificity in relation to GL-7-ACA. The six corresponding residues of the side-chain binding pocket in the PGA active-site were substituted for those of CAD. One more residue (W154b of PGA corresponding to Tyr153b of CAD), that forms the wall of the side-chain binding pocket, was also mutated [3]. Consequently, the seven residues of the side-chain binding pocket in PGA were substituted with those of CAD, namely, Phe146a,

Phe24b, Thr32b, Pro49b, Val56b, Trp154b, and Ile177b of PGA to Y146a (F146aY), Leu24b (F24bL), Tyr32b (T32bY), Gln49b (P49bQ), Arg56b (V56bR), Tyr154b (W154bY), and Phe177b (I177bF), respectively. Mutagenesis of the seven residues in the side-chain binding pocket of PGA PGA protein is translated in the E. coli TOP10 host cell as an inactive single chain precursor, consisting of a 209-residue a-subunit, a 56-residue spacer, and a 567-residue b-subunit [7,12]. The precursor enzyme is post-translationally modified into an active enzyme, consisting of one a-subunit and one b-subunit, to generate a new N-terminal nucleophilic residue, Ser1b, at the N-terminus of the b-subunit. It has been proposed that the post-translational modification of both PGA and CAD takes place in two steps [7,10,12,16]. First, intramolecular auto-catalytic proteolysis is

The mutant residues V56bR, F146aY, T32bY, I177bY, P49bQ, W154bY, and F24bL are modeled, using favorable torsion angles for the residues from the ROTAMER database and are energy-minimized using program O [20]. Virtual mutations of the PGA residues of the corresponding CAD residues generate sufficient room and the functional amino acids disposition required to favorably accommodate the glutaryl side-chain of GL-7-ACA. Only the PGA residues are labeled.

induced at one end of the spacer by a nucleophilic Ser1b, which in turn becomes a new N-terminal nucleophile of the b-subunit. Second, a subsequent intermolecular modification caused by another PGA or CAD may cleave off the other end of the spacer to leave the mature enzyme [10,12,16]. It has been shown that some mutations in the activesite of CAD hamper the generation of the mature enzyme, because they frequently inhibit intermolecular or intramolecular cleavage in the mutant precursor CAD [6,17,18]. One possible explanation for this is that some amino acids might not be able to prevent proper folding. On the other hand, mutations to unfavorable amino acids may prohibit the precursor CA from proceeding with intramolecular cleavage. The latter case was previously observed in some CAD mutants, in which intramolecular auto-catalytic cleavage did not occur [17,19], which gave rise to mutant precursor CADs with no deacylation activity. In order to obtain all possible mutants, mutagenesis should be carried out with the DNA template of the mature CAD, rather than with the DNA template of the precursor CAD [17]. Thus, we cloned a DNA fragment of PGA containing only the a- and b-subunits (not including the spacer). Once the two subunits were completely translated, they could form a mature enzyme, without undergoing intramolecular or intermolecular cleavages. This resulting expression vector resolved the problem of not obtaining mature mutant PGAs, due to incomplete post-translational modification. This expression vector is constructed in such a way that after the termination codon (TGA) of an a-subunit, a Shine­Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG) and a EcoRI site follow before the start codon (ATG) of a b-subunit (Fig. 2). A C-terminal 6Â His tag exists, which can be used for Ni2þ ­NTA affinity purification. The first residue of the b-subunit in the expression vector is translated as Met from the initiation codon ATG (Fig. 2). However, since the N-terminal residue of

the b-subunit should be a catalytic Ser1b, required to carry out nucleophilic attack [17,19], we examined whether the first residue, Met, of the b-subunit had been cleaved or not. The b-subunit was isolated by SDS­ PAGE and digested in-gel with trypsin. The resulting peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It turned out that only peptide species (SNMWVIGK) containing N-terminal Ser1b was observed in the mass spectrum, which indicated a 934.48 Da (data not shown). Presumably, the first residue, Met, may have been processed during the posttranslational modification and/or by the intramolecular auto-catalytic proteolysis by the catalytic Ser1b [17,19]. Seven mutations were cumulatively added to the wildtype PGA gene, resulting in a series of seven mutations (Table 2). The first mutation (V56bR) was carried out on the template of the wild-type PGA, and the second mutation was carried out on the template of the V56bR DNA. Subsequent mutations were carried out cumulatively up to the seventh mutation, which ultimately resulted in seven cumulative mutants, namely, V56bR (M1), V56bR/F146aY (M2), V56bR/F146aY/T32bY (M3), V56bR/F146aY/T32bY/I177bF (M4), V56bR/ F146aY/T32bY/I177bF/P49bQ (M5), V56bR/F146aY/ T32bY/I177bF/P49bQ/W154bY (M6), and V56bR/ F146aY/T32bY/I177bF/P49bQ/W154bY/F24bL (M7). In principle, the order of the cumulative mutations in each mutant PGA was selected such that accumulating a mutation would yield a soluble protein, because the addition of some mutations would have resulted in an insoluble protein. Finally, the resulting seven mutant PGAs were all expressed and purified by Ni2þ ­NTA affinity chromatography to homogeneity (Fig. 3). Analysis of deacylation activity with regard to PG and GL-7-ACA The mutant PGAs were supposed to be suitable for binding the glutaryl moiety of GL-7-ACA rather than the

phenylacetyl moiety of PG, by accommodating the charged linear glutaryl side-chain of GL-7-ACA in the side-chain binding pocket of the PGA active-site [3]. In order to confirm the effect of these mutations on the sidechain binding pocket of mutant PGAs, their specific activities of deacylation (lmolproduct /lmolprotein /min), with regard to GL-7-ACA and PG, were determined by comparing the mutant PGAs to wild-type PGA (Table 2). With each successive mutation, the deacylation activities of the mutant PGAs with respect to PG dramatically decreased. The deacylation activity with respect to PG was nearly abolished at the third mutation M3, which showed that mutational changes of the side-chain binding pocket greatly influenced the substrate specificity of the mutant PGAs. This was expected because the phenylacetyl side-chain moiety of PG was resumed to require precise interaction with the residues of the sidechain binding pocket of PGA, as in the case of the glutaryl side-chain of GL-7-ACA in CAD [6]. On the other hand, the first mutant M1 alone improved the deacylation activity with respect to GL-7ACA by more than two fold compared to wild-type PGA. As more mutations were added, deacylation activity with respect to GL-7-ACA gradually increased. The seventh mutant M7 increased the deacylation activity with respect to GL-7-ACA from 100% to 760% compared to wild-type PGA. Thus, it seems that the mutant M7 formed a mutant PGA with a side-chain binding pocket more favorable for binding to GL-7ACA. Kinetic parameters for M7 and CAD were compared. The values of KM and Vmax were 8.9 mM and 3.8 lM/min for M7, and those for CAD were 4.7 mM and 160 lM/min, respectively. It appears that KM for M7 become close to the value of of CAD, even though Vmax of M7 is still far smaller than that of CAD. It implies that the seven cumulative mutations in the sidechain binding pocket of PGA resulted in favorable binding of GL-7-ACA into active-site but chemical catalysis of M7 is yet not improved as much. The current experiment also supports the hypothesis that PGA may have originated from the same catalytic module as the CA family. The conformation of the sidechain binding pockets in the PGA and CA families may have been modified according to the requirements of specific substrates, causing them to acquire different substrate specificities. Modeling of the seven cumulative mutations of PGA The seven cumulative mutations of PGA resulted in an approximately eightfold higher deacylation activity with regard to GL-7-ACA than wild-type PGA (Table 2). And, this improvement in deacylation activity may have been due to the more favorable accommodation of the glutaryl side-chain moiety of GL-7-ACA into the newly generated side-chain binding pocket. The seven

cumulative PGA mutations were modeled, in order to scrutinize their effect (Fig. 5). A model was built such that the seven corresponding residues of wild-type PGA were replaced with those corresponding to the seven cumulative mutations. The main-chain backbone of wild-type PGA was left unchanged in the model. The modeled seven residues were then refined by energyminimization, so as to optimally accommodate the conformation of the glutaryl moiety of GL-7-ACA. This final model suggested that the accumulated mutations generated the functional groups and room required to favorably accommodate the glutaryl moiety of GL-7-ACA (Fig. 5). Modeling of the side-chain conformation was carried out for each residue and the selected torsion angles of the mutated side-chains were refined by energy-minimization using program O [20], in order for them to interact favorably with the glutaryl moiety of GL-7-ACA in the newly generated pocket. Favorable torsions for the sidechain conformations were selected from the ROTAMER database and torsional adjustments were made using TORSION [20]. The resulting model appeared to confirm that the seven mutated residues in the PGA mutant better confer GL-7-ACA binding (Fig. 5). Further development of PGA mutants In a previous mutational study of CAD [6], its deacylation activity with respect to CPC attained a level of approximately eightfold versus the wild-type CAD, and thus, the deacylation activity of the triple mutant Q50bM/Y149aK/F177bG for CPC was 16% higher than wild-type CAD for GL-7-ACA. This improvement in deacylation activity with respect to CA for CPC was a significant accomplishment [6]. The mutations performed in the study changed only the side-chains of the active-site residues in the side-chain binding pocket of CAD, in line with the objective of the current study of PGA mutations. In the present study we focused on modifying the substrate specificity of PGA to that of CA, and the results obtained show that our attempts were at least partially successful, since even PGA mutant M7 carries 2.1% of deacylation activity with regard to GL-7-ACA, compared to CAD. However, the combination of these seven cumulative mutations did not result in a mutant PGA with CPC deacylation activity. Nevertheless, further research on PGA mutants may lead to the generation of a mutant PGA with CPC deacylation activity. Another advantage of working on mutant PGA is that it has already been used to produce 6-APA in the pharmaceutical industry. Our current report provides an alternative way of developing an enzyme source with deacylation activity with respect to CPC. Hopefully, mutant PGAs will provide another way of developing a
