Chromodomain from heterochromatin protein 1 and polycomb protein is known to be a lysine-methylated histone H3 tail-binding module. Chromo-helicase/ATPase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is an ATPdependent chromatin remodeling factor, containing two tandem chromodomains. In human CHD1, both chromodomains are essential for specific binding to a K4 methylated histone H3 (H3 MeK4) peptide and are found to bind cooperatively in the crystal structure. For the budding yeast homologue, Chd1, the second but not the first chromodomain was once reported to bind to an H3 MeK4 peptide. Here, we reveal that neither the second chromodomain nor a region containing tandem chromodomains from yeast Chd1 bind to any lysine-methylated or arginine-methylated histone peptides that we examined. In addition, we examined the structures of the chromodomains from Chd1 by NMR. Although the tertiary structure of the region containing tandem chromodomains could not be obtained, the secondary structure deduced from NMR is well conserved in the tertiary structures of the corresponding first and second chromodomains determined individually by NMR. Both chromodomains of Chd1 demonstrate a structure similar to that of the corresponding part of CHD1, consisting of a three-stranded -sheet followed by a C-terminal -helix. However, an additional helix between the first and second -strands, which is found in both of the first chromodomains of Chd1 and CHD1, is positioned in an entirely different manner in Chd1 and CHD1. In human CHD1 this helix forms the peptide-binding site. The amino acid sequences of the chromodomains could be well aligned on the basis of these structures. The alignment showed that yeast Chd1 lacks several key functional residues, which are responsible for specific binding to a methylated lysine residue in other chromodomains. Chd1 is likely to have no binding affinity for any H3 MeK peptide, as found in other chromodomain proteins.

Introduction
In eukaryotic cells, DNA is stored stably in a highly ordered structure, chromatin. Its fundamental repeating structural unit is a nucleosome core, which is comprised of a histone octamer, consisting of two copies of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, and 147 bp of DNA, wrapping approximately 1.75 turns

around the histone octamer in a left-handed superhelix.1 Chromatin remodeling by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors and histonemodification enzymes greatly affects DNA function, including transcription, replication, recombination and repair. Lysine methylation at a specific site on the histone H3 tails is associated with transcriptional regulation.2­6 Methylation at H3 K4, H3 K36 and H3 K79 is linked to transcriptional activity, whereas methylation at H3 K9, H3 K27 and H4 K20 serves as a marker for epigenetic silencing. The H3 K9 and H3 K27 methylated tails are recognized by the chromodomains of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and polycomb protein (PC), respectively.7­10 The threedimensional structures of the HP1 chromodomain with H3 methylated K9 (H3 MeK9) and PC chromo-

domain. In S. cerevisiae, a chd1 strain is resistant to high concentrations of 6-azauracil (6AU).18,23 RNA polymerase II and elongation factor TFIIS mutants are sensitive to 6AU and thus Chd1 is involved in transcription elongation, interacting genetically and physically with several transcription elongation factors; for example, Spt5, Pob3 and Rtf1, a member of the Paf1 complex.24­28 Chd1 is also required to remodel chromatin for transcriptional termination.29 Drosophila CHD1 is preferentially located on actively transcribed genes,30 functions as an ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly factor for the active chromatin and exists predominantly as a monomer.31 Yeast Chd1 also functions as an ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly factor for active chromatin,32 and exists as a component of Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase (SAGA) and SLIK (SAGA-like).33 It was reported that the second chromodomain (Cd2) but not the first

1049 we tried to determine the structure of Cd12. Unfortunately, the NMR spectra were unsuitable for tertiary structure determination. However, by using a fully deuterated sample of Cd12 we could partially assign main-chain signals of Cd12, except for a linker region between Cd1 and Cd2. Figure 3 shows that the chemical shift indices of 13C and 13C for Cd12 are almost identical with those for the corresponding parts of individual Cd1 and Cd2, indicating that the secondary structural elements of Cd1 and Cd2 are essentially conserved in Cd12, except for the Cterminal region of Cd1. In Cd1 in isolation, the H3 helix ends at amino acid residue 248, whereas in Cd12 the H3 helix likely continues at least to residue 252. This helix seems to continue further in Cd12; however, after residue 253 we could not detect main chain NMR signals. Keeping these facts in mind, we determined the tertiary structures of the individual isolated chromodomains Cd1 and Cd2. The first 1H, 15N-heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of purified Cd1 showed an approximately 1.5-fold greater number of NMR signals than expected. Assignment of these signals demonstrated that there were two forms of Cd1 corresponding to the oxidized and reduced forms of two cysteine residues, Cys207 and Cys246 (Figure 1). We have solved the structure of the reduced form by NMR. The structure of Cd1 is well defined, consisting of three -strands (S1, S2, and S3) that form an anti-parallel -sheet and three helices (H1, H2, and H3) (Figure 4(a); Table 1) as expected from the secondary structural analysis (Figure 3). The loop region, L2, between the S2 and S3 strands, could not be well defined due to undetectable or unassigned NMR signals. The tertiary structure of Cd1 reveals that the positions of Cys207 and Cys246 are very close and could easily form an intra-domain disulfide bond (Figure 4(a), right). However, these cysteine residues are not found in other CHD family proteins (Figure 1) and functional significance of the disulfide bond has not been reported. Given that the intracellular environment is reducing, it is unclear whether the oxidized form of Cd1 has biological significance. The structure of Cd2 consists of a longer threestranded (S1, S2, and S3) anti-parallel -sheet and two -helices (H1 and H2) (Figure 4(b), Table 1). The loop region, L1, between strands S2 and S3, could not be well defined due to imperfect NMR signal assignments. Structural comparison with the tandem chromodomains of human CHD1 Recently, structures of the tandem chromodomains of human CHD1 in a free form and bound to H3 Me3K4 were determined in order to help in the understanding of the roles of the individual chromodomains in specific binding.36 We aligned the secondary structural elements of Cd1 and Cd2, which are essentially the same as found in Cd12 of yeast Chd1 (Figure 3), with that of CD12 (Figure 5(a)). The secondary structural elements of Cd12

chromodomain (Cd1) of yeast Chd1 bound specifically to H3 dimethylated K4 peptide.33 However, it has been reported that yeast Chd1 does not bind either K4 methylated or unmethylated H3 tails, while other ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors; namely, human SNF2h and yeast homologue Isw1p, bind to H3 tails efficiently only when K4 is diand trimethylated (Me2, Me3).34 In addition, it was reported recently that the tandem chromodomains of human CHD1 (CD12) but not yeast Chd1 (Cd12) bind directly and selectively to H3 MeK4,35 and a novel cooperative recognition mechanism of both chromodomains (CD12) was revealed by X-ray crystallography of the free and complex structures.36 Here, we have examined the solution structures of individual Cd1 and Cd2, as well as the region containing tandem chromodomains, Cd12 of Chd1 from S. cerevisiae using NMR spectroscopy to address the controversial issue of H3 MeK4 binding ability of yeast Chd1 and to determine the individual structures of Cd1 and Cd2. Although the tertiary structure of Cd12 could not be obtained, the secondary structure of Cd12 correlates well with the corresponding individual tertiary structures of Cd1 and Cd2. Comparing their structures to the human CHD1 chromodomain structures,36 we discuss their H3 MeK4-binding competence.

Results and Discussion
H3 MeK4-binding abilities of yeast Chd1 chromodomains We examined the binding abilities of chromodomains Cd1, Cd2 and Cd12 of yeast Chd1 to the H3 Me2K4 peptide using NMR and a surface plasmon resonance instrument (BIACORE). Binding could not be demonstrated for any of the proteins. Our results are consistent with previous studies that showed that yeast Chd1 chromodomains do not bind the H3 MeK4 peptide;34­36 and disagree with the report that Cd2 of yeast Chd1 interacts specifically with the H3 Me2K4 peptide.33 The buffer and construct we used in the binding assays were different from those used in the pull-down assay.33 In this experiment, we employed a slightly longer version of Cd2 (amino acid residues 279­347), which did not contain the His tag but contained a four amino acid residue vector artefact at the N terminus (GSHM). Thus, we performed the binding assays with the same construct and buffer as those used by Pray-Grant et al. (Figure 2).33 However, we could not observe any specific binding. Although we examined the ability to bind H3 Me3K4 and dual Me2K4Me2K36 peptides, no binding to these peptides occurred.

and CD12 are similar to each other; however, the structure of a loop region between strands S1 and S2 in Cd1 and CD1 is significantly different. In Cd1, there is a helix (H1) just before strand S2, while in CD1 there is a 310 helix as well as the H1 helix in the middle of the loop. As shown in Figure 3, the secondary structural elements of this region in Cd12 are essentially the same in Cd1, so Cd12 and CD12 are likely to have a different structure in this region.

The C-terminal region of isolated Cd1 deviates from a helical structure after the H3 helix. However, the H3 helix in CD12 is longer than the corresponding helix in Cd1 (Figure 5(a)). The secondary structure analysis of Cd12 indicates that the C terminus of Cd1 in Cd12 is involved in a helical structure (Figure 3). Thus, the H3 helix in Cd12 is longer than that seen in isolated Cd1, and is similar to the situation seen in CD12. Although the N-

terminal region of isolated Cd2 has a random coil structure, the corresponding part of human CD12 has a linker helix, H4. As we could not assign main chain NMR signals of Cd12 for the linker region between Cd1 and Cd2, no structural information for the linker region of Cd12 is available. However, given the sequence homology of the linker region between yeast Cd12 and human CD12 (Figure 5(a)), the linker region of yeast Cd12, including the Nterminal region of Cd2 is likely to form a helical structure similar to that found in human CD12. We superimposed the tertiary structures of Cd1 and Cd2 on the human CD12 structure (Figure 5(b)). The structure of Cd1 can be superimposed well on CD1 with respect to the anti-parallel sheet and the C-terminal helix, (the rms deviation

for the backbone structures is 0.99 Å). The C terminus of Cd1 is located in the middle of the H3 helix of human CD12 (Figure 5(a) and (b)). If the region after the C terminus of Cd1 is formed as a continuous helix in Cd12, as in CD12, the rigid hydrophobic core of Cd1 would remain unchanged, because the presumed long helix could not disrupt the hydrophobic core (Figure 5(c)). The secondary structural analysis indicates that the C terminus of Cd1 is involved in the H3 helix in Cd12 (Figure 3). To investigate the possibility of a longer H3 helix in individual Cd1, we measured the 1 H,15 N-HSQC spectrum of a bigger Cd1 construct (amino acid residues 172­278) containing the linker region. However, the length of H3 helix in the bigger Cd1 construct is unchanged.

(b) Best-fit superposition of the ensemble of the final 20 NMR structures of Cd2 (left) and schematic ribbon diagram of the average structure (right).

The C-terminal region after the H3 helix of Cd1 would be stabilized by the presumed linker helix between Cd1 and Cd2 in Cd12, in a way similar to the H4 helix in CD12. A large part of the Cd2 structure is very close to that of CD2 (the rms deviation is 0.94 Å), except for the N-terminal region of Cd2 (Figure 5(b)), which is expected to be a part of a presumed linker helix in Cd12 like the H4 helix of CD12. Although we could not assign main chain signals for this region of Cd12, we believe that such a helix could be formed in Cd12, because the stable hydrophobic core of Cd2 remains unchanged (Figure 5(d)). Thus, if Cd12 has a linker structure between Cd1 and Cd2 similar to that found in CD12, then after the C terminus of Cd1 a helical structure would be continued and form a longer H3 helix. There would also be a long linker

helix formed before the N terminus of Cd2 in a way similar to the H4 helix of CD12. If these assumptions are correct, then the individual core structures of Cd1 and Cd2 could be conserved in the whole structure of Cd12. In the comparison of tertiary structure of Cd1 and Cd2 with human CD12, the most remarkable difference is the H1 helix between the S1 and S2 strands of yeast Cd1 (Figure 5(a) and (b)) as found in the secondary structural analysis of Cd12 (Figure 5(a)). Human CD1 has 310 and H1 helices in this region, and the H1 helix is separate from the Cterminal helix (H3 helix), which is located at the inter-domain junction and helps to establish the H3 Me3K4 peptide-binding site.36 In contrast, the H1 helix of yeast Cd1 interacts mainly with the Cterminal H3 helix to form the hydrophobic core.

1053 assigned; however, on the basis of the amino acid sequences, the linker of Cd12 is likely to have a similar structure to that in CD12. We compared the 1 H,15N-HSQC spectrum of Cd12 with those of Cd1 and Cd2 (Figure 6(a)) and found significant chemical shift changes for some residues in Cd12 compared to the spectra of individual Cd1 and Cd2 (Figure 6(b)). This suggests that there are some interactions between the Cd1 and Cd2 domains and/or between both domains and the linker region between Cd1 and Cd2. If Cd12 has a linker structure similar to that in CD12, then the Cd1 H3 helix will continue to form a longer helix, and the linker between Cd1 and the N-terminal region of Cd2 will form a linker helix (H4). Interactions of Cd1 with the H3 longer helix and the linker helix, and of Cd2 with the linker helix, would be expected in Cd12. The NMR signals of residues in the linker region of yeast Cd12 could not be assigned; however, the superposition of the isolated Cd1 and Cd2 on the human CD12 structure could explain the observed chemical shift changes. In the region around the S1 strand, the residues showing changes are Ile181, Ile183 and Asn184 of Cd1. These correspond to Arg276, Met278 and Asp279 on the S1 strand of CD1, all of which are close to the H4 linker helix of CD12 (Figure 6(c)). In addition, substantial signal changes observed for Asn184, His185 (S1), Thr200 (L1) and the C-terminal region of the H3 helix, Phe249-Glu252, could be caused by the formation of the longer helix H3 in Cd12 (Figure 6(d)). Thus, the chemical shift changes observed in the Cd1 region of Cd12 could be explained by the fact that the individual core structure of Cd1 is conserved in the architecture of Cd12, which in turn is similar to the CD12 architecture. In addition, human CHD1 has an inter-domain interaction with CD2; the H1 helix between the S1 and S2 strands and the 310 helix within a loop between the S2 and S3 strands of human CD1 are located at the inter-domain junction (Figure 6(e) and (f)). The 310 helix consisting of Ser326-His327Ile328-His329 interacts extensively with Tyr388 and Gln389 at the C terminus of the linker helices, Trp413 on the C terminus of the S5 strand of CD2, Leu416 on the proceeding loop, Ser422 and Glu424 on the S6 strand, Leu428 and Ile429 on the H5 helix, and Phe433 on the H6 helix (Figure 6(e)). Yeast Cd1 has a similar sequence of Ser221-His222-Leu223-His224 in the same loop. Although we could not evaluate signal changes of many residues corresponding to those involved in the human CD1-CD2 inter-domain interaction due to imperfect signal assignments, some of the key residues are available. The NMR signals of yeast Cd2 Glu322, which corresponds to human CD2 Glu424, are changed significantly. Furthermore, the signal of yeast Cd2 Ile327, which corresponds to human CD2 Ile429, is changed modestly. A side-chain imino proton of Trp413 of human CD2 is close to the 310 helix of CD1, while that of Trp423 on the S6 strand of CD2 is distal. Consistent with this, the chemical shifts of the side-

1055 PC,13,14 S. pombe histone methyltransferase Clr4,38 and human CHD1.36 Figure 7(a) shows structurally common and polymorphic regions. The common structural region consists of a large part of the antiparallel -sheet and C-terminal helix, where the rms deviations for the backbone structures are in the range of 1.0~1.8 Å for Cd1 and 0.9~1.5 Å for Cd2. The structurally polymorphic regions consist of a region from the end of the S1 strand to the beginning of the S2 strand, and a region between the S3 strand and Cterminal helix. Here, we will refer to the two regions as polymorphic region 1 and polymorphic region 2. The highly conserved common region forms a canonical chromodomain fold For all chromodomains, the pairwise rms deviation of the backbone structures in the structurally common region ranges from 0.6­1.8 Å, indicating a remarkably similar structure (Figure 7(a)). The two -bulges are located on the S1 strands of all chromodomains, except for the Clr4 chromodomain, where the first -bulge structure was unclear from the NMR structures.38 Thus, the backbone structures in the common region are highly conserved. Subsequently, we investigated side-chain conservation in this region. A schematic figure shows significant structural conservation (Figure 7(b)). For example, comparing sequence around the -bulge structure on the S1 strand demonstrates a consensus sequence of -acidic-(/basic)-- (: hydrophobic residue). In all chromodomains, the hydrophobic residue at the fourth position of the consensus sequence is deeply buried and plays a major role in establishing the hydrophobic interaction network. Hence, the highly conserved -bulge structure is required to allow the hydrophobic residue to enter the interior and contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic core. The multiple sequence alignments find consensus sequences: D/E/x-F/Y-/F/Y--K-W on the S2 strand, C/N/S/x-S/T/x-W-E/ on the S3 strand and -x-x-F/Y in the C-terminal helix (, hydrophobic; x, any amino acid) (Figures 1 and 7(b)). Strikingly conserved side-chains interact with each other forming a canonical chromodomain architecture. Hence, the backbone folding and the side-chain interaction network are substantially conserved in the common region. Polymorphic region 1 is a key determinant for the binding of H3 MeK4 Yeast Chd1 Cd1 and human CHD1 CD1 contain additional structural elements, loop and -helix

chain 1HN and 15N of yeast Cd2 Trp311, which corresponds to human CD2 Trp413, are largely changed, whereas those of yeast Cd2 Trp321, which corresponds to human CD2 Trp423, are not altered significantly. Signal changes of yeast Cd2 Asp326 and Ala331 corresponding to human CD2 Leu428 and Phe433 are small. We speculate that this may be attributed to the smaller side-chains of Cd2. If the totally different location of the H1 helix in the isolated yeast Cd1 compared to that of the H1 helix of human CD12 is an artefact, and Cd12 has a similar 310 helix and/or -helix at the equivalent position, significant chemical shift changes should be observed in Cd1 and Cd12 for residues on the H1 helix itself and its surrounding regions, the L1 loop, the S1 and S2 strands, the C-terminal half of the L2 loop, the S3 strand and the H3 helix of Cd1, and the H1 helix of Cd2 (Figures 5(b) and 6(f)). Only small signal changes of the residues in a large part of the L1 loop, the S2 and S3 strands of Cd1 and the H1 helix of Cd2, which correspond to the loop between the S1 and S2 strands, the S2 and S3 strands of CD1 and the H5 helix of CD2 of human CD12, respectively, were observed. Thus, the data do not support the proposal that the structural differences seen in Cd1 are artefactual (Figure 6(b) and (f)). The chemical shift indices of C and C for the isolated Cd1 and Cd2, which are essentially identical with those of Cd12, indicate clearly that the H1 helix of Cd1 is present in the same conformation in Cd12 with no additional helix formation within the proximal L1 loop in Cd12 (Figure 3). The lack of structural change in the L1 loop is also supported by the unchanged high signal intensities of the residues in this region in Cd12 (data not shown). It is very unlikely that the H1 helix of Cd1 in yeast Cd12 lies at the inter-domain junction as found in CD12 (Figure 5(b)). In conclusion, yeast Cd12 is likely to adopt a similar relative configuration of domains to that observed in human CD12. However, the position of the H1 helix is quite different from that of the corresponding H1 helix of CD12. The H1 helix of Cd12 is located in the same position as observed in isolated Cd1 and it is not used for an inter-domain interaction with Cd2. Structural comparison with other chromodomains identifies a structurally common region and polymorphic regions 1 and 2 Next, we compared the Cd1 and Cd2 structures with those of all other chromodomains for which there are structures; namely, chromodomains of Drosophila HP1, 11 mouse HP1,12,37 Drosophila

Structural Polymorphism of Chromodomains in Chd1

1057 Structural differences in polymorphic region 2 prevent the possibility of utilizing the binding mode of HP1 and PC chromodomains Both HP1 and PC chromodomains have a -strand structure in polymorphic region 2, whereas Chd1 Cd1 and Cd2 adopt a helical structure (Figures 1 and 7(a)). HP1 and PC chromodomains recognize the extended H3 peptide by forming a -sandwich architecture with the -strand in polymorphic region 2 and the N-terminal region.11­14 The helical structures of Cd1 and Cd2 in polymorphic region 2 make such recognition difficult. As already revealed, human CHD1 CD1 has a -strand-like structure just after the H2 helix in polymorphic region 2, but it occupies the position where the H3 peptide interacts with the HP1 and PC chromodomains.36 We made a deletion mutant lacking two amino acid residues of Cd2 (Val328 and Lys329) in order to disrupt just this helix, but the mutant had no tertiary structure. To confirm the binding inability of both Cd1 and Cd2 to H3 MeK9 and MeK27, we performed a binding assay with Me2K9, Me2K27 and Me2K36, Me2K79 and H4 Me2K20 peptides using NMR. None of Cd1, Cd2 and Cd12 bound any methylated peptide. In addition, we tested asymmetric H3 Me2R2, Me2R17, Me2R26 and H4 Me2R3 peptides. However, no binding to any of these peptides occurred (data not shown).

(and 310 helix in CD1) in polymorphic region 1, whereas the other chromodomains have a simple -hairpin (Figures 1 and 7(a)). Structure-based multi-alignment indicates that the long and diverse sequence of polymorphic region 1 is a distinguishing feature of the first chromodomain of the CHD protein family (Figure 1). Interestingly, in subfamily I of the CHD family, there is an obvious delineation between yeast and higher organisms. The sequences of polymorphic region 1 of the higher organisms are considerably conserved, indicating the functional significance in the formation of the H3 Me3K4 binding site. In contrast, there is no homology with yeast homologues. However, even in yeast homologues, there is a low level of homology between budding yeast and fission yeast. Our structural analysis suggests that yeast Cd12 has a structure similar to that of human CD12, but cannot form the H3 Me3K4 binding site observed in human CD1, because of the entirely different positioning of the H1 helix (Figure 8(a)). Considering sequence variations, the structural difference of the polymorphic region 1 in yeast Cd1 and human CD1 seems to be reasonable. The structure determination of the complex of human CHD1 CD12 and the H3 Me3K4 peptide demonstrated a novel binding mode, whereby human CD1 recognizes the methylammonium of the H3 Me3K4 through only two aromatic residues, Trp322 and Trp325,36 not the three aromatic residues seen in HP1 and PC chromodomains (Figure 8(b)).11­14 The loss of the cation­ interaction between the third aromatic residue and the methylammonium seems to be compensated by an adjacent cation­ interaction between H3 Arg2 and CD1 Trp325.36 In the present structural analyses we could align the amino acid sequences of yeast Chd1 and human CHD1 chromodomains correctly. From this alignment, we can confidently conclude that yeast Cd1 lacks the functionally essential aromatic residue corresponding to Trp325 of human CD1, having instead Glu in the equivalent position (Glu220). Furthermore, yeast Cd1 has other nonequivalent residues in the positions of the H3 Me3K4 peptide-interacting residues of human CHD1 (Figures 5(a) and 8(b)).

Conclusion
In this study, we examined the H3 MeK4-binding ability of yeast Chd1 chromodomains, Cd1, Cd2 and Cd12 and found that none of them has any specific binding ability to this ligand or to other methylated lysine or arginine histone peptides. We identified two polymorphic regions in the chromodomain architectures (polymorphic regions 1 and 2). On the basis of the present structural analyses, we found a distinguishing feature of yeast Chd1 Cd1 in polymorphic region 1 compared to human CHD1 CD1. On the basis of the structures, the amino acid sequences of various chromodomains could be aligned and the critical sequence and structural differences in polymorphic region 1 of Cd1 of yeast

Chd1 when compared to CD1 of human CHD1 lead to the conclusion that the chromodomain of yeast Chd1 cannot be a H3 MeK4-binding module. Our conclusion necessarily raises the question as to what is the target of yeast Chd1 chromodomains? Further studies are needed to identify their functional roles.

Materials and Methods
Construction of expression plasmids For subcloning the nucleotide sequences of Cd1, Cd2, and Cd12 (corresponding to amino acid residues 172­252, 279­347 and 172­347) into bacterial expression vectors, the

oligonucleotides CDP1: 5-AGCAG CATATGCAACCAGAGGACTTCC-3 and CDP2: 5-AGCAGCATATGGATGAA TTTGAGGAGTTC -3 were designed to create an NdeI site (underlined) and to add a methionine codon before the Gln172 residue for Cd1 and Cd12 and Asp279 for Cd2. The oligonucleotides CDP3: 5-CAGCAGGATCCTTATTCGATGATGAATTG C-3 and CDP4: 5CAGCAGGATCCTTAGAGGATCTTAGAGTTTTC-3 were designed to create a BamHI site (underlined) immediately after the stop codon (bold letters) for Cd1, Cd2 and Cd12. Nucleotide fragments were amplified by PCR using the following combination of oligonucleotides: CDP1 and CDP3 for Cd1, CDP2 and CDP4 for Cd2 and CDP1 and CDP4 for Cd12. The pCHD1 plasmid containing the complete open reading frame of S. cerevisiae Chd1 (scChd1 cDNA) was used as template. The nucleotide

Yeast Cd1, orange; human CD1, green; polymorphic region 1 of yeast Cd1, brown; and that of human CD1,deep green. sequences of the cloned PCR products were confirmed using an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The NdeI-BamHI fragments of scChd1 cDNA were then subcloned into pET15b vectors (Novagen) to produce N-terminal His6-tagged Cd1, Cd2, and Cd12 expression plasmids. Purification of Cd1, Cd2, and Cd12 The Cd1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The cells were grown at 37 °C in LB or in M9 minimal medium containing [15N]ammonium chloride with or without [13C]glucose. The temperature was reduced from 37 °C to 25 °C just before induction by 1 mM isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After 5­8 h growth the cells were harvested. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, 1 mM phenylethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM benzamidine) containing 100 mM NaCl (BA100). The cells were lysed by sonication, centrifuged, and the supernatant loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen) column, equilibrated with BA100 containing 20 mM

1060
imidazole-HCl. The sample was eluted by a linear gradient from 20 mM to 400 mM imidazole-HCl. Peak fractions were pooled and diluted by the addition of an equal volume of buffer A and then applied onto a QSepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A. The sample was eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 1 M NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled and the buffer was changed to buffer B (20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol, 2.5 mM CaCl2). The sample was digested with thrombin for 12 h at 25 °C to remove the His6 tag, concentrated by a Centriprep (Amicon) and again loaded onto the Ni-NTA agarose column equilibrated with buffer B. Cd1, which passed through the column was concentrated by a Centriprep and applied onto a Superdex30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol. The buffer of the protein-containing fractions was changed to the NMR buffer by dialysis. The same purification procedure was applied for Cd2 and Cd12. The (2H, 13C, 15 N)-labeled Cd12 sample was obtained by growing cells in M9 minimal medium containing 100% 2H2O, [13C] glucose and [15N]ammonium chloride. NMR spectroscopy The concentration of protein for NMR experiments was 0.3­0.5 mM in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 300 mM NaCl (30 mM deuterated DTT for Cd1) dissolved in either 90% H2O/10% 2H2O or 99.9% 2H2O. NMR experiments were carried out at 25 °C for Cd1 and at 20 °C for Cd2 on a Bruker AVANCE-500 equipped with a cryogenic probe, an AVANCE-600 or an AVANCE-800 spectrometer. Backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned using the following experiments: CBCA(CO)NH, CBCANH, HN(CO) CA, HNCA, HN(CA)CO, HNCO, double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY), total COSY (TOCSY), HBHA(CO)NH, HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, CCCONH, HCCCONH.39 Stereospecific assignments were obtained from a combination of HNHB, HN(CO)HB, HNCG, HN (CO)CG,40 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY)-HSQC (50 ms mixing time) and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (50 ms mixing time).39 Distance information was obtained from NOESY, 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (50 ms and 150 ms mixing time) and 13C-edited NOESYHSQC (50 ms and 100 ms mixing time).39 Backbone torsion angles  were obtained from HNHA.39 Side-chain torsion angles 1 and 2 were obtained from a combination of HNHB, HN(CO)HB, HNCG, HN(CO)CG,40 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (50 ms mixing time), and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (50 ms mixing time).39 The NMR experiments for the backbone resonance assignments of Cd12 were performed at 20 °C on a Bruker Avance 800 spectrometer equipped with a cryo-probe using 0.7 mM (2H,13C,15N)labeled Cd12 dissolved in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.4), 50 mM NaCl, 10% 2H2O. Backbone resonances were assigned using transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-HN(CO)CACB, TROSY-HNCACB, TROSY-HN (CO)CA, TROSY-HNCA, TROSY-HN(CA)CO, TROSYHNCO.39,41 Side-chain 1HN and 15N resonances of the tryptophan residues of Cd12 were assigned using 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC.39 Spectra were processed by NMRPipe,42 and analyzed by NMRView.43 Structure calculation Interproton distance restraints derived from NOE intensities were grouped into three distance ranges, 1.8­

Structural Polymorphism of Chromodomains in Chd1 2.7 Å (1.8­2.9 Å for NOEs involving HN protons), 1.8­ 3.3 Å (1.8­3.5 Å for NOEs involving HN protons), and 1.8­ 5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, and weak NOEs, respectively. The upper limit was corrected for constraints involving methyl groups, aromatic ring protons and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons. Dihedral angle restraints for  and  were obtained from 3JHN estimated from HNHA and analysis of the backbone chemical shifts with TALOS.44 The 1 and 2 angles were restrained ±30° for three side-chain rotamers. Hydrogen bond restraints in areas of regular secondary structure were introduced at the final stages of refinement. Structure calculations were performed by distance geometry and simulated annealing using X-PLOR.45 A total of 100 structures were calculated. Structural statistics for the 20 best structures are summarized in Table 1. Structures were analyzed and displayed using PROCHECK-NMR,46 GRASP,47 MOLMOL,48 SYBYL (Tripos Inc., St. Louis), and PyMOL. Histone peptide-binding assay Histone H3 and H4 peptides were synthesized and purchased from both Qiagen and SIGMA Genosys. Each histone peptide was added to 0.1 mM 15N-labeled chromodomain in the molar ratio of 1:1 and 1:4 (chromodomain to peptide). We mainly used 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 20 mM NaCl (30 mM deuterated DTT for Cd1) as the sample buffer dissolved in 90% H2O/10% 2 H2O. 1H,15N-HSQC spectra were taken before and after addition of the peptide. Surface plasmon resonance analysis Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using a Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore) at 25 °C. The running buffer was 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT.33 The biotinylated dimethylated K4, K9 and unmodified histone H3 N-terminal peptides (amino acid residues 1­21 ;Upstate) were first immobilized onto the SA sensor chip (Biacore), which has pre-immobilized streptavidin. Samples of analytes (30 l) Cd1, Cd2 and Cd12, at 20 M were injected into the flow-cells at a flowrate of 30 l/min followed by 180 s dissociation time. Binding surfaces in the flow-cells were regenerated by two 15 s injections of 50 mM NaOH, 1 M NaCl. Protein Data Bank accession codes Coordinates have been deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank. The accession codes are 2DY7 for Cd1 and 2DY8 for Cd2.
