Autotracing of Escherichia coli acetate Ê CoA-transferase a-subunit structure using 3.4 A Ê MAD and 1.9 A native data
The automation of protein structure determination is an essential component for high-throughput structural analysis in protein X-ray crystallography and is a key element in structural genomics. This highly challenging undertaking relies at present on the availability of high-quality native and derivatized protein crystals diffracting to high or moderate resolution, respectively. Obtaining such crystals often requires signi®cant effort. The present study demonstrates that phases Ê obtained at low resolution (>3.0 A) from crystals of SeMetlabeled protein can be successfully used for automated structure determination. The crystal structure of acetate Ê CoA-transferase -subunit was solved using 3.4 A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data collected from a crystal Ê containing SeMet-substituted protein and 1.9 A data collected from a native protein crystal.

1. Introduction
High-throughput protein crystallography is feasible because of dramatic progress in the automation of gene cloning, protein puri®cation, crystallization and particularly in utilization of multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) methods using synchrotron radiation (Hendrickson, 2000; Hendrickson et al., 1985) and the development of new software for automated protein-structure solution (Lamzin & Perrakis, 2000; Perrakis et al., 1999; Terwilliger & Berendzen, 1999). TProjects like the NIH-sponsored Protein Structure Initiative (Norvell & Machalek, 2000; Stevens et al., 2001) foster the development of instrumentation, methods and software to automate the process of protein-structure determination. However, a signi®cant bottleneck is the interpretation of electron-density maps and model building. Current autotracing programs can be used only with high-resolution diffraction data and with moderate resolution phases and are therefore strongly dependent on the availability of high-quality crystals and synchrotron facilities. Since crystallization screens rarely produce diffractionquality protein crystals, signi®cant effort is needed to re®ne crystallization conditions in order to produce crystals suitable for structure determination. The need to prepare crystals of derivatized protein further increases the required effort. Additional dif®culties arise from the needs of the MAD experiment, which requires larger amounts of data than experiments with native protein crystals and is more vulnerable to radiation damage. Therefore, methods that enable automated structure determination using lower resolution MAD data would be of general interest to the structural

biology community and will expand the spectrum of targets suitable for high-throughput crystallography. In this paper, we present the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli acetate CoA-transferase (ACT) -subunit solved with minimal manual intervention using only lowÊ resolution (3.4 A) MAD data collected from the crystal of Ê SeMet-derivatized protein and 1.9 A resolution data obtained from the crystal of native protein. The enzyme belongs to the family of coenzyme A-transferases found in archaea, bacteria, metazoa and mitochondria of mammals. The structure is of biological relevance, as E. coli ACT shows 36% sequence identity with the product of the human gene encoding mitochondrial succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA-transferase (SCOT; Jencks, 1973). Mutations of the latter enzyme cause a metabolic disease which leads to severe ketoacidosis.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample preparation

All reagents were purchased from Sigma, except where speci®cally mentioned otherwise in the text. The open reading frame of the E. coli ACT -subunit was ampli®ed from genomic DNA with high-®delity Pfx DNA polymerase, using conditions and reagents provided by the vendor (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene was cloned into pET30XaLIC (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) using the Ligation Independent Cloning protocol (Dieckman et al., 2002). This process generated an expression clone producing a fusion protein with a thrombin-cleavable His tag and a factor Xa-cleavable S tag (His-S-ACT). The fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) (Stratagene) harboring an extra plasmid encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg; ATA for Ile). The cells were grown in LB media at 310 K to an OD600 of $0.6 and following induction with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h at 303 K the bacteria were harvested and stored at 203 K. The frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in binding buffer (300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0 and 10 mM imidazole) and lysed by sonication after the addition of lysozyme to 1 mg mlÀ1 and 1 mM PMSF. The lysate was clari®ed by centrifugation, passed through a 0.2 mm ®lter and applied to a metal-chelate Ni±NTA af®nity column (Qiagen). After the column was washed, His-S-ACT was eluted from the column with 250 mM imidazole in binding buffer and dialyzed into thrombin cleavage/capture buffer A (20 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.4, 0.15 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2). The His tag was cleaved from the protein by treatment with biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) overnight at room temperature using 1 unit of protease per milligram of protein. The mixture was incubated with Streptavidin Agarose (Novagen) at room temperature for 30 min and the biotinylated thrombin was removed from the cleaved protein by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min in a Spin Filter. The cleaved protein (S-ACT) was then puri®ed from the His-S-ACT by passage of the mixture through a second Ni±NTA column. The S tag was cleaved by treatment with factor Xa protease (Novagen) in buffer A overnight at room temperature using

2 units of protease per 50 mg of protein. The mixture was then incubated with Xarrest Agarose (Novagen) at room temperature for 30 min and the cleaved protein was puri®ed from factor Xa protease by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min using a Spin Filter. ACT was further puri®ed using a Mono Q column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 20 mM bis-tris propane pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DDT buffer and eluted with a 0.05±0.5 M NaCl gradient. The protein was dialyzed against 20 mM bis-tris propane pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DDT and concentrated using a BioMax concentrator (Millipore). SeMet-labeled protein was prepared as in Walsh et al. (1999).
2.2. Crystallization

Hexagonal crystals of S-ACT protein were grown at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method in 6±10% MPD, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 6.5, 0.2 M magnesium acetate. Crystals reached maximum dimensions of 0.3 Â 0.1 Â 0.1 mm in one week. For data collection, crystals were gradually transferred into a solution containing 20% MPD and ¯ash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The crystals belonged to space group P62, with unit-cell parameters Ê a = b = 88.9, c = 106.6 A and two molecules per asymmetric Ê unit, and diffracted to 3.2 A resolution. Crystals of SeMetlabeled S-ACT protein (0.15 Â 0.07 Â 0.07 mm) were grown Ê under similar conditions. MAD data were collected to 3.4 A resolution at three wavelengths near the selenium absorption edge (Table 1).

cleaved off were grown under slightly altered conditions (6% MPD, 0.1 M glycine pH 8.0 and 0.2 M magnesium acetate) and reached maximum size (0.1 Â 0.03 Â 0.03 mm) in three Ê months. In spite of their small size, they diffracted to 1.9 A resolution and had unit-cell parameters a = b = 88.5, Ê c = 105.1 A. All data were collected at beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory and were processed with HKL2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). Details of data collection and processing are shown in Table 1.

following density modi®cation with the program SOLOMON (Abrahams & Leslie, 1996) as implemented in SHARP. Se-atom positions were subjected to the program FINDNCS (Lu, 1999) from the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) to ®nd the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) matrix and to automatically build the mask with the program NCSMASK. The resulting phases were combined with the high-resolution native data set Ê and phases were extended to a maximum resolution of 1.9 A with program DM (Cowtan & Zhang, 1999) using NCS averaging. The ®nal phases were used in the program ARP/wARP (Perrakis et al., 1999) for automated building of the protein structure. Atomic model and electron-density maps were visualized using the program O (Jones, 1985) and re®nement was carried È out with the program CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). The correlation coef®cient between different electrondensity maps and ®nal protein model was calculated using CCP4 programs as implemented in the `Map correlation' task in the ccp4i interface v. 1.1.1.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystallization and data collection

32 mg of $95% pure His-S-ACT protein was obtained from 1 l of culture after a single immobilized metal-af®nity chromatography (IMAC) step. A portion of the His-S-ACT protein was used for crystallization screens, while the remainder was subjected to thrombin cleavage. After cleavage of the His tag and further puri®cation using IMAC, the S-ACT protein was more than 98% pure and was also subjected to crystallization screening. The ef®ciency of S-tag cleavage with factor Xa was low and we did not use the native ACT protein for crystallization screening. Both His-S-ACT and S-ACT

Ê protein crystal and the 3.4 A MAD data enabled determination of the ACT subunit structure. The important question for high-throughput crystallography was whether the data were suitable for automated structure determination. The crystal contains two protein molecules per asymmetric unit, with six methionines per molecule. Ten heavy-atom peaks were found using the program Shake-and-Bake with a data set collected at the selenium white line. Initial phases were calculated with the program SHARP followed by density modi®cation with SOLOMON. The low-resolution maps obtained by this process were of good quality and clearly showed recognizable -helices and -strands of the protein structure (Fig. 1a). Phase extension to the highest resolution of the native data Ê (1.9 A) produced maps with more features (Fig. 1b). Nevertheless, the quality of extended phases was insuf®cient for autotracing with the program ARP/wARP (Table 2) and we utilized the presence of non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS).

limits for the native data were the same as shown in Table 2 for DM. The upper part of Table 2 summarizes the statistics for successful runs, while the bottom three rows correspond to situations where autotracing failed. The calculations with Ê 2.3 A resolution data were partially successful. Radiation damage to the crystal was clearly observed during processing of the diffraction data. Phasing with three-wavelength data sets failed. The best results were obtained using two wavelengths (peak Ê and in¯ection) at 3.4 A resolution for phasing and phase extension to the highest resolution with 100 cycles of density modi®cation and NCS averaging. The resulted phases were of suf®cient quality for quick convergence of autotracing. The single anomalous dispersion (SAD; Wang, 1985) approach in which only data collected at peak energy were used for phasing also produced phases of a good quality suf®cient for Ê quick autotracing. Using only 2.1 A data for phase extension Ê and autotracing as well as using 4 A resolution for phase calculation with subsequent phase extension to the highest resolution also allowed successful autotracing of the model. Autotracing failed in all cases when NCS averaging was omitted during phase extension. 3.1.2. Biological significance of the structure. E. coli acetate CoA-transferase shares a high degree of sequence similarity with other members of the coenzyme A-transferase family, which consists of 71 sequence homologs in 50 unique species of bacteria, archaea and metazoa. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of CoA from an acyl-CoA donor to a carboxylate acceptor and plays a key role in prokaryotic and eukaryotic metabolism, enabling the activation of various carbon compounds for subsequent oxidation (Jenkins & Weitzman, 1986). The bacterial enzymes are heterotetrameric (22), in which the -subunit binds CoA while the -subunit provides catalytic glutamate. The ACT -subunit shows 36% sequence identity with the N-terminal half of the mitochondrial enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT; EC 2.8.3.5), which consists of a single chain collinear with the two / bacterial subunits and is essential in ketone metabolism (Rochet & Bridger, 1994). The three-dimensional structure of the ACT -subunit (Fig. 2) and its dimeric assembly show overall structural similarity to the -subunits of glutaconate CoA-transferase (GST) from A. frementans (Jacob et al., 1997; PDB code 1poi), the only CoA-transferase with a known three-dimensional structure. The r.m.s. deviation between ACT and GST Ê -subunits is 1.9 A for most C atoms of ACT and the orientation of the subunits in a dimer is very similar. Loops 77±82, 132±151 and the C-terminal residues 245±319 of GST do not have structural analogs in ACT. Of the four GST residues predicted to be involved in substrate binding, only Gln103 is preserved, while Thr27 is substituted with Met, Tyr74 with His and Ser78 belongs to the loop which is missing in ACT. These changes are likely to re¯ect the different substrate speci®city of the enzymes. Three Mg2+ ions were found in the ACT structure (Fig. 2). None of them are located near the putative active site, hence their functional relevance is not clear. The CoA-binding signature (pfam01144, Pfam v6.6; Sonnhammer et al., 1997) common to ACT and SCOT varies in GST. The GST -subunit shows less than 20% sequence identity with SCOT, while the ACT sequence has 36% identity with SCOT. This suggests the ACT structure may be a useful intermediate in the modeling of the mitochondrial enzyme. Neither ACT nor GST was crystallized with substrates and additional structural and modeling experiments are required to further study the catalytic mechanism.

4. Conclusions
Structural genomics strategies are often based on targeting the largest possible number of proteins in order to increase the overall success of the project. Current technologies enable a high-throughput approach for the initial steps from cloning to initial crystallization screening for the majority of soluble proteins. The later steps of structure determination have considerably lower productivity and in general only a limited set of proteins suitable for high-throughput structure determination are selected to continue work with. At this point, it is important to know the current limitations of automated structure-determination methods. Here, we have showed that density modi®cation and extension of low-resolution phases, which are routinely applied in conventional protein crystallography (one of the best examples is in Braig et al., 1994), can be successfully applied to high-throughput autoÊ mated structure determination. Phases calculated from 3.4 A Ê MAD data and extended to 1.9 A resolution for the native data were successfully used for the automated structure determination of a medium-sized protein. We also obtained an automated solution in test cases when initial phases were only Ê calculated at 4.0 A resolution or with phase extension to 2.1 Ê and 2.3 A. These data cannot truly simulate situations in real protein crystals with such diffraction limits, but they also Ê Ê provide evidence that 3.4 A MAD and 1.9 A native data are not at the threshold level of automated structure determination. An essential element of our approach was NCS averaging during phase extension. Without NCS averaging, the data were not suf®cient to enable autotracing with ARP/wARP. Similarly to previous observations (Rice et al., 2000), we found that the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion approach (SAD) also provides phases of a good quality and enabled quick autotracing of the structure. In addition to broadening the spectrum of protein crystals suitable for high-throughput structural analysis, these results are also important for choosing a data-collection strategy. Since without NCS averaging resolution limits became a crucial parameter, the best strategy seems to be collecting SAD data of the highest possible resolution at the absorption-peak energy. On the other hand, MAD phases are generally of a better quality than SAD phases (Rice et al., 2000). In this respect, an alternative strategy could require the collection of data at two different wavelengths: ®rst a quick data set at lower than the absorption-edge energy (for example, at the in¯ection-point energy) to minimize radiation damage and second a data set at peak

energy with the highest possible resolution. The ®rst data set will serve as a test for optimization of the data-collection strategy and will provide data for resolving the initial phase ambiguity of SAD phases. In order to evaluate these and other strategies, more crystals of different quality have to be tested. Structural genomics projects should provide an excellent opportunity for such experiments.
