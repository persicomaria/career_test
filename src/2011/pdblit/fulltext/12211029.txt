ABSTRACT Cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) play a critical role in xenobiotic binding and metabolism, as well as in modulation of oxidative stress. Here, the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of homodimeric human GSTA1-1 in the apo form and in complex with S-hexyl glutathione (two data sets) are reported at 1.8, 1.5, and 1.3Å respectively. At this level of resolution, distinct conformations of the alkyl chain of S-hexyl glutathione are observed, reflecting the nonspecific nature of the hydrophobic substrate binding site (H-site). Also, an extensive network of ordered water, including 75 discrete solvent molecules, traverses the open subunit­subunit interface and connects the glutathione binding sites in each subunit. In the highest-resolution structure, three glycerol moieties lie within this network and directly connect the amino termini of the glutathione molecules. A search for ligand binding sites with the docking program Molecular Operating Environment identified the ordered water network binding site, lined mainly with hydrophobic residues, suggesting an extended ligand binding surface for nonsubstrate ligands, the so-called ligandin site. Finally, detailed comparison of the structures reported here with previously published X-ray structures reveal a possible reaction coordinate for ligand-dependent conformational changes in the active site and the C-terminus.

Key words: glutathione S-transferase; X-ray structure; glutathione; water structure; ligandin INTRODUCTION Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) comprise a large family of glutathione binding proteins that attach glutathione to various substrates as part of a general detoxification scheme. Seven classes of mammalian, cytosolic GSTs are now known and there are representative X-ray structures for most classes.1­3 GSTs are in general homodimers. Each monomer has two domains, an / domain that includes helices 1­ 3 and a largely -helical domain comprised of helices 4 ­ 9. The former contains a
 For ease of description later, the following definitions of helices are used (from 1GUH): 1, 17­26; 2, 38 ­ 47; 3, 68 ­79; 4, 86 ­111; 5A, 114 ­129; 5B, 132­143; 6, 155­170; 7, 179 ­190; 8, 192­198; 9, 210 ­220.

glutathione binding site (sometimes denoted G) on top of the domain. A hydrophobic pocket (denoted H) lies largely between the domains in which a generally hydrophobic substrate binds and reacts with the glutathione to form a conjugate product. Residues around this pocket define the specificity for the substrate. Each glutathione is in general bound by residues from both monomers. A key characteristic of the A class of GSTs is the presence of a C-terminal helix ( 9) that is disordered in the absence of substrate and glutathione and ordered in the presence of conjugate (or substrate alone), thus completing formation of the H site.4 ­7 We recently showed that an engineered mutant of rat GST A1-1 crystallized so that even in the absence of conjugate the C-terminus could be ordered when there was a packing interaction that helped support it.8 Human apo GST A4-4 has been shown to have an ordered C-terminal helix in the absence of glutathione and substrate9; however, we previously suggested8 that a specific sequence difference may be responsible. In particular, there is a proline at residue 10 in A4-4 instead of phenylalanine in A1-1. The side-chain position of Phe10 differs between the apo and conjugate bound forms and in the apo form occupies the space that Phe220 from the C-terminal helix occupies in the conjugate bound form. With a proline present, this would not occur in the A4-4 form. Human GST A1-1 with the inhibitor S-benzyl glutathione bound was the first member of this class to have its structure described (1GUH) at 2.6-Å resolution.4 The structures of hGST apo (1GSD), its complex with ethacrynic acid­ glutathione conjugate (1GSE), and its complex with ethacrynic acid alone (1GSF) have been described at 2.5, 2.0, and 2.7 Å respectively.5 All of these were determined at room temperature. We found crystallization conditions that yield crystals that diffract at cryogenic temperature

to high resolution at a synchrotron. We report here the structures of apo hGST at 1.8 Å and hGST A1-1 with S-hexyl glutathione bound at 1.5 and at 1.3 Å. Two data sets (GTX-GST-1.5 and GTX-GST-1.3) were used to solve and refine the complex. EXPERIMENTAL Preparation of Mutants and Structure Determination Glutathione S-transferase was prepared as described previously.10 Great care had to be taken in the purification stages to eliminate the S-hexyl glutathione conjugate to finally obtain an apo form. These molecules were originally intended for study with novel inhibitors, which in fact while coloring the crystals did not bind in an ordered manner. Each was crystallized in sitting drops from 10 mg/mL protein. The apo hGST was crystallized in 22% PEG3350, 0.1M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, GTX-GST-1.3 in 15% PEG 2000, 0.1M Tris-Cl pH 7.5, and GTX-GST-1.5 in 18% PEG 3350, 0.1M Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 10mM dithiothreitol. Twenty percent glycerol was added for cryo conditions for

all three data sets, and the dithiothreitol concentration was lowered to 5 mM for GTX-GST-1.5 but not used for either the apo or the GTX-GST-1.3 data sets. Data were collected at 160°C at beam-line 9-2 at SSRL, processed with DENZO,11, 12 and merged and scaled with SCALEPACK.13 The space group is C2, with cell dimensions as shown in Table I. The structure refinement started using the human GST A1-1 structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1GSE] without cofactors and solvent. ShelXL-9714 was used for all refinement calculations and XtalView15 for all model fitting. Rigid body refinement of the dimer in the asymmetrical unit of GTX-GST-1.5 yielded an R-factor (R

 Crystallization conditions for GSE and GSF (the ethacrynic acid complexes) were similar: 10 ­20% PEG2000, 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 30 mM NaOAc (pH 4.5) and 1% -mercaptoethanol.5 Only the ethacrynic acid­GSH complex gave roughly the same cell dimensions (C2: 100 95 52 Å, bgr; 93°).5 Both the apo and ethacrynic acid complex gave space group C2 and cell dimensions 100 95 104Å, 92°, as did the GUH structure (the S-benzyl GSH complex).4

 Waters have been renamed from the name used in the ShelXL refinement by a Perl script (Jeff Godden, unpublished data) that labels the water according to the residue to which it is closest. The first digit in the numbering after the P is the site number, e.g., P1014, P2014, P3014 indicate three waters near residue 14. The program MOE was used to obtain this list: An atom was selected in the glycerol moiety, and the function MOE SEL ATOMSELECT PROXIMITY was used repetitively with the distance set to 3.4 Å, only on the set of atoms containing GTX, glycerol, and solvent. Then, to find which protein atoms were connected to these atoms of chain A were selected and the PROXIMITY function repeated once more and MOE SEQ SELECT RES OF SELECTED ATOMS chosen to highlight those residues. These were then put in this table by hand. Waters P5003, P3100, P4101, and P3101 were predicted by ShelXL to be new solvent, but were not included in refinements. Waters P6xxx, identified as not near protein, retain their original ShelXL numbering. a These solvents are close to the glycerol moieties, not protein.

free16) of 0.46 (0.45) for 60,182 data from 10 ­1.5 Å. Rigid body refinement of the monomers reduced R to 0.37 (0.37); one cycle each of coordinate refinement followed by individual thermal parameter refinement reduced R further to 0.29 (0.34). At this point, the cofactor and solvent were found in a sigma-weighted17 difference (Fo Fc) map and added: R 0.28 (0.33). Several five-membered rings of solvent were visible in difference density maps. The model was checked and refit and refinement continued. The S-hexyl part of the glutathione was not as well defined as the rest of the model (R 0.22; Rf 0.27). Anisotropic thermal parameters were introduced for each chain and refinement continued: (R 0.14; Rf 0.22). The model just before anisotropic refinement was used to initiate refinement using the 1.3-Å data from the second data set (GTX-GST-1.3), but the same steps were followed: rigid body refinement of dimer, rigid body refinement of monomers, refinement of coordinates, coordinates plus thermal parameters, etc. The atoms in the S-hexyl tail of the glutathione adduct gradually emerged and rings of water were again visible. At an R factor of about 0.20, evidence of either oxidized methionine or two conformations for methionines 51, 63, and 105 was seen and modeled as two conformations. Refinement continued, eventually including anisotropic thermal parameters; the final R for GTX-GST-1.3 is 0.12 (Rf 0.18). An additional few cycles using all the data brought the overall R to 0.14 for all data and 0.12 for the data with F 4 . The refinement of the apo structure at 1.8 Å proceeded as for the others except without using anisotropic thermal parameters, starting at the same point as the previous model. There is no density for a cofactor and no interpretable density for the final C-terminal helix. The final R factor for the apo model is 0.25 (Rf 0.34) for all the data (0.21, Rf 0.30 for data with F 4 ), as shown in Table I. Coordinates for each of the models and structure factors

for the data sets have been deposited in the PDB with codes 1K3L, 1K3Y, and 1K3O. RESULTS Quality of the Model; Unusual Conformations The program PARVATI18 was used to analyze the anisotropic thermal parameters. For GTX-GST-1.5, the mean anisotropy (ratio of smallest to largest principal value for each thermal ellipsoid: purely isotropic would be 1.0) was 0.35 with a standard deviation of 0.12; the 12 residues containing atoms that exhibited the largest anisotropy were in monomer A (N190,V55, R89*, and K141) and in monomer B (M208, R221, D146, L170, F197, E29, K182, and R89*). The respective equivalent isotropic thermal parameters for these residues are: 40,15, 20*, 40, 111, 49, 35, 35, 20, 49, 41, and 20* Å2, so anisotropy apparently does not necessarily correlate with magnitude of thermal parameter. (The asterisks indicate that the residue was also modeled with alternate conformations.) For GTX-GST1.3, the mean anisotropy was 0.40, with a standard deviation of 0.12. The 12 most anisotropic residues were in monomer A (M51*, M63*, K182, M105*, E126*, and N11) and in monomer B (M63*, M105, K182, M51*, E29, and K65) and their respective equivalent isotropic thermal parameters are 22*, 41*, 50, 33*, 64*, 38, 58*, 30*, 68, 15*, 85, and 44Å2. Figure 1 is a plot of the thermal ellipsoids for GTX-GST1.3 and for GTX-GST-1.5. Figure 2 illustrates the electron density for a phenylalanine that shows low anisotropy. Figure 3 is a plot of the equivalent average isotropic B values for GTX-GST-1.3 as a function of residue number. Residues 105-120, in addition to the C terminal helix, generally have high B values in GST structures. In the packing of this crystal form, residues B114-115 are near residues A28-29 and A79-A80 of a symmetry related molecule, and thus have lower thermal parameters. This

The somewhat gray values represent depth cueing. The region between helix 4 and helix 5 in the A subunit of each molecule can be seen to have the highest values, while the core of the protein is clearly most isotropic and has the lowest thermal parameters.

turn between helix 4 and 5 in the other monomer faces a solvent pocket and is more free to adopt several conformations, and thus has significantly higher thermal parameters, seen both in Figure 1 and Figure 3. This flexibility will be described further below in the comparison with the other hGST A1-1 structures. The Ramachandran plot in Shelxpro showed the following outliers for GTX-GST-1.5: in monomer A (Q67, D171, and R221) and in monomer B(R13, Q67, R131, and D171). Of these, only Q67 has glycine-like phi angles: While this occurs in the GSD, GSE, and GSF structures,5 the peptide is flipped in the GUH structure (2.6-Å resolution,. with S-benzyl glutathione bound). In the former structures, and in ours, the peptide orientation permits a solvent molecule to bind between the amide nitrogen and an oxygen atom of

the carboxylate side-chain of the N-terminal portion of the glutathione. The low thermal parameters associated with this peptide are consistent with its being correctly oriented, so the nonstandard orientation seen in the present structure appears functionally relevant. The remaining outliers are only marginally outside acceptable limits. Similarly for the higher-resolution model, GTX-GST-1.3, in monomer A (R13, Q67, and D171) and in monomer B (E3, R13, Q67, and D171) are outliers in the Ramachandran plot according to Shelxpro. Residue E3 in monomer B is in a loosely ordered portion of the structure with high thermal parameters. Residue 13 is in the middle of a loop in the / domain near the start of helix 1 and forms an important connection to residue E169 on the all- domain, a pair of hydrogen bonds against which Pro207 rests.

Pro207 is really the last well-ordered residue in the apo structure. The phi-psi angles of R13 lie just outside the acceptable helix values, probably because it contributes to an enlargement of the turn that starts helix 1. Although not flagged by Shelxpro, Gln53 has glycine-like phi­psi angles. It appears that the side-chain of Gln53 is hydrogen bonded via a water to the carbonyl oxygen of Arg 45, and its amide nitrogen makes a weak hydrogen bond to the peptide carbonyl oxygen of residue i-3, all part of a complex structure that holds the C-terminal end of S-hexyl GSH. The side-chain of the other outlier, Asp171, forms a hydrogen bond with the peptide nitrogen of 173, forming a side-chain­main-chain interaction somewhat like an "Ncap" to a helix-like turn starting at 173, effectively forcing a turn from the previous helix, helix 6. Asp171 resides on the "upper" side of the molecule, in the turn between 6 and 7, adjacent to the mobil turn between helix 4 and helix 5. Asx motifs in which the Asx side-chain participates in side-chain­main-chain interactions that would normally be main-chain­main-chain interactions have been well described.19 The present case most resembles a Class 1 Asx-motif (Asx -turn).19 In this motif, there is a second hydrogen bond interaction in which the main-chain C O

is hydrogen bonded to Ni 3. While Asx motifs may occur at functionally interesting sites, Wan and Milner-White note that an average protein of 200 residues contains nearly 2.5 Asx motifs. Nevertheless, the phi-psi angles ( 166, 109) for Asp171 are outside the range reported, and given the resolution of the structure suggest that indeed the residue may be somewhat strained. Searching for additional Asx motifs in the structure, one finds that Asp61, Asn80, and Asn151 each have glycinelike conformational angles (not unusual for Asn residues). Asp61 is in a tight turn between strands 2 and 3, with its side-chain hydrogen bonded to Lys78. Asn80 is in a peculiar turn at the C-terminal end of a helix, with a weak hydrogen bond from its NH to On 3. N151 lies in the middle of a series of -type turns that link helix 5B and 6 and forms a more open Asx-like structure in which the side-chain­main-chain interaction is actually bridged by a solvent molecule. Asp209 is an even better example of an N-cap Asx interaction ( 100, 180) with phi-psi angles characteristic of the type h i i 3 Asx motif.19 The GTX-GST-1.3 structure contains three glycerol molecules in its structure. Two of these are hydrogen bonded to each other and in turn to each glutathione at its amino terminus (Fig. 4). The third glycerol occupies a site previ-

ously identified as a -mercapto-ethanol derived disulfide in the ethacrynic acid­ glutathione conjugate-bound hGST structure (1GSE). Interestingly, this glycerol is bound directly to protein only via its O2, to OE1 of E97 in chain A. The GTX-GST-1.5 structure has water sites in place of the glycerol moieties, possibly a result of the lower resolution, although different PEGs were used for crystallization, and GTX-GST-1.5 had DTT in its crystallization medium as well. These glycerol molecules are in turn hydrogen bonded to a network of solvent molecules that includes 75 solvent sites (to be described further below). With the use of cryoprotectants for the ever increasing number of lowtemperature structures, many structures have glycerol in them: The PDB20 lists 334 entries, as of February 2002, containing ordered glycerol coordinates. In the course of refinement with the GTX-GST-1.3 data, several methionines were found to be either modified or disordered. Most likely, these are all oxidized: Met16 and Met57 are buried and show no sign of disorder, while Met51, Met63, Met94, and Met105 are all exposed to solvent and have been modeled as disordered. Met208, at the hinge where the C-terminal helix pivots to help form the H site, has significantly anisotropic thermal parameters and is likely to be oxidized/disordered as well. Possibly, absence of dithiothreitol has allowed these residues to

become oxidized; apo GST also does not have dithiothreitol in the medium, but the resolution is not sufficient to see modified methionines. Cys112 was observed to be disordered in one of the monomers of GTX-GST-1.5 (the thermal parameter for SG in the A subunit is 89 Å2): This was shown by mass spectrometry (data not shown) to result from glutathionylation of this residue, although the latter could not be seen in the density. Interestingly, this was the data set from crystals that were exposed to DTT. Cys112 lies at the end of helix 4, and the side-chain faces toward the twofold axis between the monomers. The S-hexyl moieties actually adopt two different conformations in the GTX-GST-1.3 dimer. The equivalent isotropic thermal parameters for the S-hexyl side-chain in the A monomer range from 34 ­58 Å2 while those in the rest of the GSH moiety lie between 10 and 18Å2. In the B monomer, they are 28 ­39 Å2, while in the main portion of the GSH between 11 and 23Å2. Apparently, there is enough room in the H pocket, and an absence of specific interactions, for multiple conformations of this side-chain. This perhaps contributed to the difficulty in initially finding density for these atoms. While this apo structure was done at 1.8-Å resolution and the reported apo (1GSD) at 2.5 Å, apparently residues

111­120 in monomer A in the present structure are more disordered than those of the earlier structure. These two apo structures actually occur in different space groups: compare Table I and the footnote on page 619. Different packing and absence of cryoprotectant may underlie the more ordered 112-120 region in monomer B. Visual comparison of the two structures shows that the lower temperature structure appears to be slightly expanded over 1GSD. Some side-chains have slightly different positions, but none are noteworthy. DISCUSSION A key concept in the function of the A class GSTs is the dynamics of the C-terminal helix, helix 9, when it closes down after (or concomitant with) substrate binding. Even when ordered, the C-terminal helix usually has high thermal parameters compared to the rest of the structure. The C-terminus is not the only region that exhibits apparent mobility. The protruding ends of the 4- 5 helices and the region between them (residues 113­121) also exhibit high mobility when not involved in crystal packing interactions. Examination of mobility in the rest of the structure using animation of a series of structures--apo/GSF/GTX-GST1.3/GSE ( apo/nonconjugate ethacrynic acid bound/S-hexylGSH conjugate/ethacrynic acid-GSH conjugate) (http://

www.bmsc.washington.edu/people/adman/gst_movie1. html)--reveals some interesting patterns. One is the appearance/disappearance of small portions of secondary structure at the ends of helices, including formation of a single turn of helix in the loop between helix 6 and 7 containing residues 173­178. There is a break in the long 5 helix at residues 129 ­132, where a turn is wider than it needs to be for a continuous helix. Bulges, or extra residues, in long helices frequently signal functional residues: For example, in cytochrome P-450 a midhelix Thr (252 in P450-cam) that protrudes out is a key residue in directing oxygen insertion into substrate.21 In the present case, at the kink in helix 5 there is an Arg (131) that binds to the C-terminal carboxylate of the glutathione substrate in the opposite monomer (Fig. 4). Formation of the kink is facilitated by the presence of a proline at residue 134 eliminating a hydrogen bond in the helix. This kink is opposite a less apparent kink in helix 4 that possibly results from the presence of glycine residues 98 and 103 in the helix. Absence of a side-chain at position 98 is required for packing of Phe57 that lies below Tyr132. The presence of a more flexible residue at position 103 may be

Fig. 5. Two views of the "solvent puddle" seen in GTX-GST-1.3 dimer. Large spheres are solvent positions and small spheres are oxygen or nitrogen protein positions within 3.4 Å of the solvent molecules. An important feature is that this puddle spans both monomers and forms a band that does not rise above a certain level, evident in (b). Figure made with Molscript30 and Raster3D.31

Fig. 6. Comparison of apo [apo, this work, (purple)], ethacrynic acid with no GSH [1GSF5 (cyan)], S-ethacrynic acid GSH [1GSE5 (red)], S-benzyl-GSH [1GUH4 (yellow)], and S-hexyl GSH [GTX-GST-1.3, this work,(green)], in the region around GSH showing helix 9 and helix 4 as cylinders. Only selected side-chains are shown for clarity. The cofactors are drawn in ball-and-stick, while side-chains are shown as solid frames. Short connecting chains are shown in white. S-Hexyl GSH at the lower left can be seen to differ little among the structures. Arg15 at the lower center is hydrogen bonded to Glu104 on helix 4, which lies vertically at the right. Tyr9 is directly beneath GSH and Phe10 fans out underneath Phe220, which comes from helix 9, running horizontal at the top of the figure. Phe10 in the apo structure (purple) can be seen to occupy the place that Phe220 would occupy if the helix were localized in the apo structure. Phe222 is also seen to systematically correlate with the position of Phe10 (green/yellow/red/cyan: S-hexyl-GSH/S-benzyl GSH/ethacrynic acid GSH/no GSH). Arg216 also seems to correlate somewhat, although the order of the cyan and red side-chains are interchanged relative to the Phe222 order. Leu 213 is packed against Met 208 (also shown, just behind where the conjugates lie, near where the two cylinders appear to touch). Met 208 is also loosely in contact with Phe10 (there are no atoms directly between the two side-chains, although they are 4.5 Å apart and, in all except the present work, the thermal parameters for the SD and CE are high compared to its remaining side-chain atoms). Also shown on helix 4 are Leu107, Leu108, and Val111, residues that comprise part of the H site. Figure made with Molscript30 and Raster3D.31

necessary so that residue 104 can form a salt link to Arg15 of the same monomer, the side-chain of which also lies close to the cysteinyl sulfur of the glutathione. Asp101, also in the kinked part of helix 4, forms a hydrogen bond with the N-terminus of the glutathione of the opposite chain, as well as to a water that links to Tyr132, adjacent to Arg131. Hence, there is a continuous network of interactions emanating from helix 4 that can sense glutathione in both active sites. A cluster of solvent atoms that form a set containing members within 3.4Å of each other and of the glycerol molecules covers the interior surface of the dimer and also serves to connect the two glutathione moieties (Fig. 5). There are 75 such solvent molecules, listed in Table II. Of these, 14 are not within contact of a protein atom and 61 are. Included in this cluster are many that form pentagonal rings of hydrogen-bonded water molecules, as seen for other proteins.22 The pentagon-forming solvent molecules obey the dimer symmetry for the most part. Figure 5(b) shows that the ordered water lies mostly in a band below the components of the structure that differ the most between various hGST structures, namely, the mobile elements, helix 9, and the 4- 5 linking region. Comparison with Figure 1 shows that, not surprisingly, the ordered water is associated with the part of the structure with lowest thermal parameters. The Molecular Operating Environment software package23 contains a module (Alpha Site Finder) that can locate likely ligand binding pockets in receptor molecules, using a geometric algorithm that excludes shallow solventaccessible pockets, and obvious solvent-only binding sites, but also takes into account hydrophobicity of a candidate site.24 Using this module on the hGST atoms and omitting GTX, glycerol, and solvent, the three "sites" with the largest number of hydrophobic contacts in the "receptor" were examined visually. Two sites are, not surprisingly, part of the equivalent G sites and all of the H sites. The site with the largest number of "receptor" contacts is, surprisingly, the solvent puddle described above. Each of these "alpha sites" contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic contact atoms in the receptor: For example, the site equivalent to the solvent puddle has 487 contact atoms, of which some 147 are hydrophobic. This solvent binding site has potential functional significance. Many GSTs, and in particular A-class isoforms, bind large hydrophobic nonsubstrate ligands such as hemes, bilirubin, and organic dyes. This behavior has been historically referred to as the "ligandin" function of GSTs.25, 26 Such ligands inhibit the GST catalytic activity, but the mode of inhibition is usually complex, with both competitive and noncompetitive components. It has been widely proposed that the ligandin binding site is distinct from the hydrophobic substrate binding site, although some overlap may exist.27, 28 The X-ray crystal structures of GSTP1-1 with several nonsubstrate ligands indicate their partial occupancy of the substrate binding site, with an additional adjacent site partially occupied.29 However, Oakley et al.29 propose that this additional site is not conserved in the GSTA1-1, suggesting that the ligandin site in this isoform may be different. It is interesting that no X-ray structure has been published for a complex of a ligandin-type

molecule with GSTA1-1, and their binding site(s) remain unidentified and poorly characterized. The solvent puddle observed here suggests an intriguing possibility for a large site spanning both subunits. Additional studies exploiting site-directed mutants may reveal whether this solvent binding site is functionally important. Finally, comparison of the five structures of hGST A1-1 in the region of the largest differences in structure shows a continuum of positions for several key residues that define the H site (Fig. 6). These structures are: (1) apo (this work, purple); (2) 1GSF, with ethacrynic acid but no GSH5 (cyan); (3) 1GSE, GSH ethacrynic acid conjugate5; (4) 1GUH, S-benzyl GSH conjugate4 (yellow); and (5) S-hexyl GSH conjugate (this work, GTX-GST1.3, green). The position of Tyr9, a key catalytic residue that hydrogen bonds to the SG of glutathione, is virtually unchanged. However, Phe10 and Phe222 show complementary positions: The closer Phe10 is to the H site, the further away Phe222 is. Indeed, when Phe10 has completely moved to the Phe220 site, as it does in the apo form, the entire C-terminal helix is not visible. However, Phe222 and Phe10 are greater than 7 Å apart so they do not interact directly but rather through the substrate. It is interesting to speculate that these might correspond to intermediates in the opening up of the protein and release of product. Interestingly, the most "apo-like" of the states is that where ethacrynic acid is bound without GSH (cyan). One can imagine that when substrate binds it causes Phe10 to swing into the position that then allows Phe220 and the C-terminal helix to close down to complete formation of the binding site. While helix 4 is also somewhat mobile, especially toward its Cterminal (upper) end, residues facing the H site appear less variable in location than those on the C-terminal helix. The extensive bed of hydrogen-bonded solvent lies beneath these mobile structures, as can be seen in Figure 5. CONCLUSIONS The high-resolution structures of apo and S-hexyl glutathione-bound human GST A1-1 exhibit a large grouping of solvent molecules that appear to help further define the most mobile portions of the structure, namely, the Cterminal helices and the "tower" formed between helix 4 and helix 5. Hydrogen bonds that connect glutathione in one site to the glutathione in the other site occur both via protein side-chain interactions and through this network of solvent. The solvent network can include well-ordered glycerol moieties. This network may represent the ligandin binding region previously characterized functionally but not structurally. Comparison with previously determined GSTs shows apparently correlated differences in the most mobile elements of the structure that may be indicative of actual structural changes upon product release in the overall reaction.
