Ultrahigh-resolution structure of high-potential iron±sulfur protein from Thermochromatium tepidum
Crystals of the high-potential iron±sulfur protein (HiPIP) Ê from Thermochromatium tepidum diffract X-rays to 0.80 A using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The crystal structure of this HiPIP was re®ned at this ultrahigh resolution with anisotropic temperature factors for all atoms to conventional crystallographic R factors of 0.092 and 0.101 for Fo > 4'(Fo) and all re¯ections, respectively. The present structure provides Ê a more precise picture than the previous 1.5 A structure and allows location of the positions of most H atoms. The structure revealed a partly hydrophobic cavity near the main hydrophobic area and a much larger inter-cluster approach distance Ê (23.454 A, the c constant of the unit cell) in the crystal packing than other types of HiPIPs. The structural features involved in the electron-transfer reaction of HiPIP are discussed.

1. Introduction
High-potential iron±sulfur proteins (HiPIPs) are a class of ferredoxin proteins that have a molecular weight in the range 6±10 kDa and contain an [Fe4S4] cubane cluster (Kerfeld et al., 1998). In many phototrophic eubacteria, HiPIPs exist abundantly in the periplasmic space and function as soluble electron-transfer carriers between the membrane-bound photosynthetic reaction centre and the cytochrome bc1 complex (Bartsch, 1978). They utilize two cluster oxidation states, [Fe4S4]2+ and [Fe4S4]3+, operating over a wide range of relatively high reduction potentials from +450 to +50 mV (Carter et al., 1972; Meyer et al., 1983). In addition, HiPIPs from different species show a large variation in their primary structures, net overall charges and sizes (Rayment et al., 1992). HiPIPs are still of great interest as a number of fascinating questions remain unanswered with regard to the dominant factors governing their reduction potentials and intermolecular electron-transfer behaviour. Crystallographic studies have revealed the presence of a hydrophobic environment around the [Fe4S4] cluster that is constructed of several conserved aromatic residues (Breiter et al., 1991; Rayment et al., 1992). Mutagenesis studies have identi®ed the effect of these aromatic residues on the stability of the [Fe4S4]3+/2+ redox couple by isolating the cluster from the solvent (Agarwal et al., 1995; Soriano et al., 1996). Rapid electron self-exchange behaviour observed by the EPR technique lent support to the hypothetical mechanism that dimerization through a ¯attened and relatively hydrophobic surface patch might be of primary importance in the intermolecular electron transfer (Couture et al., 1999). Very recently, the ®ve hydrogen bonds that are highly conserved between backbone amides and metal-bound ligands, as idenLiu et al.

ti®ed by previous structural studies, were shown to signi®cantly affect the reduction potential (Low & Hill, 2000), in contrast to the observation that the number of these hydrogen bonds was not a determinant of the redox potential. A K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic study showed that the significant effect of the covalency of the metal±ligand bond of the cluster on the reduction potential was attributable to the extent of hydrogen bonding, particularly that to the bridging sul®des (Glaser et al., 2001). Moreover, molecular-dynamics and theoretical studies based on crystal and solution structures have brought insight into the possible electron-transfer pathway and the large variations in reduction potentials that depend on the class of HiPIPs (Banci et al., 1992). In spite of extensive crystallographic, spectroscopic, mutagenesis, chemical modi®cation and theoretical studies of HiPIPs, it is still unclear which factors determine the reduction potentials and electron-transfer behaviour, since it is not easy to de®ne how covalent bonds, hydrogen bonding and through-space jumping contribute to these behaviours (Balabin & Onuchic, 2000). Here, we report the crystal structure of HiPIP from Ê T. tepidum re®ned at 0.80 A resolution. T. tepidum is a thermophilic photosynthetic purple sulfur bacterium classi®ed in the Chromatiaceae family, which also includes a mesophilic sulfur bacterium, Allochromatium vinosum. This HiPIP has 83 amino-acid residues and a redox midpoint potential of +323 mV (Moulis et al., 1993). Its crystal structure has Ê previously been reported at 1.5 A resolution on the basis of diffraction data collected at room temperature (Nogi, Fathir et al., 2000). We focused our examination on the hydrophobic interaction and crystal packing in this ultrahigh-resolution structure, which led us to discuss the electron-transfer behaviour in comparison with other HiPIP structures. IV imaging-plate detector at BL40B2. The X-ray wavelength Ê was 0.7293 A and the crystal-to-detector distance was 110 mm. Data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997). The unit-cell parameters of the P212121 crystal were anisotropically much smaller at 100 K Ê [a = 44.697 (1), b = 58.272 (1), c = 23.454 (1) A] than those determined at room temperature (a = 47.12, b = 59.59, Ê c = 23.62 A; Nogi, Kobayashi et al., 2000).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Crystallization, data collection and processing

The crystallization method and conditions have been reported previously (Nogi, Kobayashi et al., 2000). The crystallization conditions were optimized by adjustment of the volume ratio of protein to reservoir solution as follows: 5.5 ml of 20% protein solution (in 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0) was mixed with 4.5 ml of reservoir solution (1.4 M ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 3.5) to produce the crystallization drop, which was equilibrated against 1 ml reservoir solution. Plate-like crystals with a maximum size of approximately 0.3 Â 0.15 Â 0.5 mm were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293 K. Prior to data collection, the crystal was cryoprotected by soaking it in crystallization reservoir solution containing 25% glycerol, mounted in a ®bre loop and then frozen to 100 K in a cryogenic nitrogen stream. Diffraction data collection was performed using synchrotron radiation at beamlines BL40B2 Ê and BL44B2 at SPring-8. The best data set (0.80 A resolution) was collected from a single crystal with a total rotation of 180 and an oscillation step of 1.0 and was recorded on an R-AXIS

SHELX97 (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997) and O (Jones et al., 1991) programs were used for re®nement and model building with manual adjustment, respectively. A randomly selected 3355 re¯ections (5% of the total observed re¯ections) Ê in the full resolution range (20±0.80 A) were used as a test set Ê for free R-factor calculation. The 1.5 A resolution structure at room temperature (Nogi, Fathir et al., 2000) was employed as the initial model for re®nement, with all the solvent molecules omitted. With careful consideration of the large changes in unit-cell parameters between room and low temperature, the model was initially relocated in the unit cell with AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) and subsequently re®ned by rigid-body ®tting Ê in the resolution range 20±1.5 A using SHELX97, which gave R and Rfree factors of 0.246 and 0.268, respectively. After checking the map and minor adjustments of the model, several cycles of isotropic re®nement in the resolution range Ê 20±0.80 A lowered R and Rfree to 0.193 and 0.209, respectively. Thereafter, solvent molecules were automatically introduced to the model structure with SHELXWAT (Sheldrick & Ê Schneider, 1997) with a B-factor cutoff of 50 A2 and sulfate anions were also added manually. At this stage, the R and Rfree factors were reduced to 0.152 and 0.164, respectively. Further re®nement was carried out using conjugate-gradient leastsquares minimization with anisotropic B factors. In this step, Ê standard deviations of 0.02 and 0.04 A were used as the restraints for the 1,2 and 1,3 distances and R and Rfree fell to 0.106 and 0.126, respectively. The H atoms (CÐH and NÐH) were then located automatically with SHELX97, but their coordinates were not re®ned. The introduction of the H atoms to the model lowered R and Rfree to 0.100 and 0.115, respectively. After several cycles of manual adjustment and re®nement, multiple conformations of several amino-acid residues and several additional water molecules were added to the model, which was subjected to a ®nal step of one cycle of full-matrix least-squares minimization. In this re®nement, the L.S. and BLOC commands were combined to perform the leastsquares calculation (Sheldrick & Schneider, 1997). The Ê maximum shifts in atom positions were 0.030 and 0.165 A and Ê 2 for the maximum shifts of the B factors were 0.47 and 17.7 A non-H atoms and solvent atoms, respectively. The highest and deepest peaks in the ®nal difference map (Fo À Fc) were 1.6' and À1.2', respectively. This ®nal model gave R = 0.101 and Rfree = 0.114. The ®nal model was evaluated with PROCHECK (Collaborative Computational Project,

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural model

Ê The structural model of T. tepidum HiPIP at 0.80 A resolution gave R factors of 0.101 and 0.092 for all observed and I > 4(I) re¯ections, respectively. The corresponding Rfree factors for 3355 randomly selected test-set re¯ections and for those with I > 4'(I) were 0.114 and 0.103, respectively (Table 1). The model contains all 83 residues, the iron±sulfur cluster, three sulfates and 93 water molecules (seven water molecules were re®ned with double `conformations'). The anisotropic temperature factors employed for all atoms, including all solvent atoms, and for alternative conformations of the protein lowered the R factors by 4±5%, whereas the positioning of H atoms reduced the R factors by $0.5%. No H atoms were generated for water molecules, although they could be occasionally identi®ed in the Fo À Fc maps. In the Ê ®nal model, the isotropic B factors ranged from 3 to 31 A2 and Ê 2. Eight atoms of the iron±sulfur the mean B factor was 9.97 A Ê cluster had a lowest mean B factor of 3.25 A2 and their maximum shifts in both coordinates and B factors were the Ê Ê lowest (<0.001 A and 0.008 A2, respectively) in the last fullmatrix least-squares re®nement. The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) deviations of the ®nal model from ideal geometry were Ê 0.016 A and 2.0 for the bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. The stereochemistry check showed that 97.1 and 2.9% of the residues were located in the most favoured and additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively (Table 1).

The overall structure has essentially the same fold as the room-temperature strucÊ ture at 1.5 A resolution (Nogi, Fathir et al., 2000), but signi®cantly large differences still exist at the C-terminus and in the region around Asp10 (Fig. 1). In the crystal, these two parts contact compactly with the neighbouring molecules. Therefore, these differences have mostly arisen from the effect of cryotemperature on crystal packing in the orientation of the crystallographic a axis (Fig. 1), although they may also have been partially affected by the minor adjustment to the crystallization conditions. These differences were also re¯ected in the large change in the Ê a unit-cell parameter (2.42 A, >5% of a) depending on the data-collection temperature. There were no such large changes in the unit-cell parameters of the b and c axes and also no large structural changes in the direction of the b and c axes.

structure contained 43 water molecules, whereas 93 molecules were located in the ultrahigh-resolution structure. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the electron-density map showed that the geometry around the sulfate ion is essentially tetrahedral. Moreover, most H atoms appeared clearly in the Fo À Fc map at the 3.0' level, which provides direct evidence for hydrogen bonding. Fig. 2(c) show the positioning of the H atoms of Cys75 at the 3.5' level. formed in a similar way in all HiPIPs. These hydrogen bonds are thought to be associated with the mid-point redox potential (Low & Hill, 2000). In addition, the aromatic residues responsible for the hydrophobic atmosphere around the cluster are mostly conserved in these HiPIPs. Of the HiPIPs, those from A. vinosum and Marichromatium purpuratum have the structures closest to that of T. tepidum; this is consistent with the high homology among the primary structures of these HiPIPs (Kerfeld et al., 1998; Parisini et al., 1999). These three HiPIPs have relatively close mid-point redox potentials: 3.3. Comparison of the overall structure of T. tepidum HiPIP +323, +350 and +390 mV for T. tepidum, A. vinosum and with other HiPIPs M. purpuratum, respectively. In contrast, the HiPIPs from Halorhodospira halophila and Rhodocyclus tenius, which have Although there is considerable variety in the primary low sequence homology with that of T. tepidum, showed quite structures, redox potentials, net overall charges and sizes of large structural differences in the area distant from the cluster. HiPIPs from different species, their iron-cluster structures are However, the mid-point redox potentials of 310 and 120 mV highly conserved and the folding in the vicinity of the cluster is for the R. tenius (Rayment et al., 1992) and H. halophila very similar (Fig. 1). In addition to the hydrogen bond (Breiter et al., 1991) HiPIPs, respectively, do not correspond to generated between a backbone N atom (Cys75) and an S atom these structural differences. [(S1)] of the cluster, four other hydrogen bonds between Because the T. tepidum HiPIP shows $90% sequence backbone N atoms and S atoms of the cysteinyl ligands are homology with the A. vinosum HiPIP, it is expected that the structural differences between these two HiPIPs might provide direct insight into the differences between their mid-point redox potentials and their thermal stabilities (Moulis et al., 1993). Superimposition of the C atoms between the structure of A. vinosum HiPIP (the Ê H42Q mutant at 0.93 A resolution) and the present structure gave an r.m.s. deviation of Ê 0.78 A. The largest difference in their folding was located between Asn52 and Asp57, which also resulted in one less net overall charge in T. tepidum HiPIP (À5) than in A. vinosum HiPIP (À6). Despite these differences, a highly conserved iron± sulfur cluster has an approximate C2v point-group symmetry in these two types of Ê HiPIPs, with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.008 A. In this cluster (Fig. 2a), the Fe(1)ÐFe(2) Ê distance (2.758 A) in T. tepidum HiPIP is Ê approximately 0.049 A longer than that of Ê Fe(3)ÐFe(4) (2.709 A), whereas the Ê difference is only 0.025 A in the structure of A. vinosum HiPIP (Table 2). There are no signi®cant differences in the distances of the ®ve conserved hydrogen bonds or in the conformations of the aromatic residues responsible for hydrophobicity around the cluster between these two HiPIPs (Table 2). Thus, the difference in two FeÐFe bonds between the two clusters, which is relatively Figure 2 Ê Ê small but signi®cant ($3'; ' = 0.016 A for Electron-density maps of T. tepidum HiPIP at 0.80 A resolution.

from the cluster and has been suggested to be have less relation to the function of HiPIP (Moulis et al., 1993; Nogi, Fathir et al., 2000). Nevertheless, the introduction of one more charged residue and the consequent net overall charge reduction may be connected with the slight increase in the thermal stability of T. tepidum HiPIP, as well as the effect of the deletion in the amino-acid sequence.
3.4. Crystal packing and inter-cluster approach distance

The inter-cluster distances are of interest because spectroscopic studies have indicated that the closest distance between the Fe±S clusters is a potential parameter for the intermolecular electron transfer (Dunham et al., 1991; Rayment et al., 1992). In the HiPIP structure, the cluster is surrounded by several conserved aromatic residues that provide a hydroTable 2 phobic environment (Fig. 3). There is a highly hydrophobic Bond and hydrogen-bond distances in the cluster of T. tepidum and area in the molecular surface in which the S(4) atom of the A. vinosum HiPIPs (Parisini et al., 1999), with estimated standard cluster is located.

Interestingly, the closest intercluster distance between neighbouring molecules, a potential indicator of the electron-transfer behaviour (Rayment et al., 1992), does not decrease with the increase in the compactness of the molecular packing in the cell (Table 3). On the contrary, this distance tends to increase with the increase of the packing compactness.

distance, as in the present T. tepidum HiPIP, contacts between the two hydrophobic cavities were not observed; in one crystal form of A. vinosum HiPIP the S(4)ÐS(4) distance was even longer than the centre-to-centre distance. These results suggest the inter-cluster distance observed in crystals might be a weak indicator of the possible electron-transfer pathway.

Two types of soluble proteins, cytochrome c2 and HiPIP, are responsible for electron transfer from the cytochrome bc1 complex to the reaction centre (RC) complex in purple bacteria. HiPIP and cytochrome c2 interact with the reaction centre by different mechanisms, although the binding regions of the contact proteins overlap for both types of electron carriers. A mechanism based on electrostatic interaction has been well accepted for the cytochrome c2±RC interaction, whereas a hydrophobic coupling of the encounter surfaces has been suggested for the HiPIP±RC interaction (Osyczka et al., 1998, 2001; Osyczka, Nagashima, Sogabe et al., 1999; Nogi, Fathir et al., 2000). Nevertheless, the role of positively charged lysine residues of HiPIPs must also be considered (Schoepp et al., 1995; Osyczka, Nagashima, Shimada et al., 1999). EPR and NMR studies have shown that HiPIPs might dimerize in the solution through their hydrophobic surfaces, a discovery that has led to important insights regarding the electron-transfer pathway (Groeneveld et al., 1988; Bertini et al., 1993; Couture et al., 1999). These spectroscopic results indicated that the exchange constant in the potential dimer in solution was basically independent of the ionic strength, but that the HiPIP±RC interaction was signi®cantly related to the ionic strength, which implies that the hydrophobic surface might not be simply equated with the electron-transfer path. Although a T. tepidum HiPIP molecule is surrounded by many other molecules in crystals, there are several areas on its molecular surface that are inaccessible to other protein molecules. These areas are mostly located in the proximal and distal sides of the cluster, as shown in Fig. 3. It has been shown that these two areas of the molecular surface have very different electrostatic potentials: the proximal side is highly hydrophobic, while the distal side is hydrophilic (Nogi, Fathir et al., 2000). From analysis using VOIDOO (Kleywegt & Jones, 1994), the hydrophobic proximal side was shown to have a cavity where the S(4) atom at an apex of the cubic cluster approaches the hydrophobic surface. The present ultrahigh-resolution structure in which the H atoms could be located revealed that another cavity that is partly hydrophobic and uncharged is located near the Fe(3) atom of the cluster (Fig. 3). This cavity is relatively small and is mostly constructed of -strands and a loop composed of residues Gln50, Val53, Gly60-Cys61-Gln62 and Phe64-Pro65-Gly66Lys67. This region includes a few hydrophilic residues, but no charged residues except Lys67. The positively charged side chain of the exceptional Lys67 is far from the cavity, supporting the partial hydrophobic atmosphere in this region. Three water molecules are found in this cavity and no

neighbouring protein molecules accessible to this region are found in the crystal packing. Although the main hydrophobic cavity was previously thought to be of primary importance, the special location of this partly hydrophobic cavity may suggest a role in electron transfer. Firstly, the bottom of the cavity is Cys61, which coordinates with the Fe(3) atom of the cluster. Both experimental and theoretical studies have revealed there to be a total of one iron pair, with mixed valences of +2.5 for each iron, and that there was possibly an equilibrium of the distribution between the Fe(4)±Fe(3) and Fe(3)±Fe(2) pairs that share the mixed valence (Bertini et al., 1993, 1995). In this equilibrium, Fe(3) always seems to have a valence of +2.5, suggesting that this iron plays some special role. In other words, the interaction between this cavity and Fe(3) through Cys61 may contribute to part of the electron-transfer pathway. Secondly, this cavity is located near the main hydrophobic cavity and has some hydrophilic residues but no charged residues. An exception is that one lysine residue (Lys67) contributes its main-chain part to this cavity; its side chain, however, is distant from the cavity (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, this lysine may play a signi®cant role in HiPIP±RC recognition (Schoepp et al., 1998). Thus, this partly hydrophobic structure supports the hydrophobic patch for electron transfer through this region and, more importantly, might help to explain the fact that mutations at the potential encounter position on the reaction centre, consisting of a change from hydrophobic (valine) or negatively charged residues (glutamates) to positively charged residues (lysine), signi®cantly decreased the electron-transfer ef®ciency of HiPIP (Osyczka, Nagashima, Shimada et al., 1999).
