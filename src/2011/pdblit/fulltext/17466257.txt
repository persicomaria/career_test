The activation of growth factor receptors induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its C-terminal part, creating binding sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins. Grb2 is a protein that recruits Sos, the exchange factor for Ras. Recruitment of Sos allows for Ras activation and subsequent signal transmission. This promotes translocation of MAP kinases into the nucleus and activation of early transcription factors. Grb2, a 25 kDa protein, is composed of one SH2 domain surrounded by two SH3 domains. The SH2 domain of Grb2 binds to class II phosphotyrosyl peptides with the consensus sequence pYXNX. Thus, Grb2 is a good example of a bifunctional adaptor protein that brings proteins into close proximity, allowing signal transduction through proteins located in different compartments. To explore the interactions between Grb2 and phosphorylated ligands, we have solved the crystal structure of complexes between the Grb2-SH2 domain and peptides corresponding to Shc-derived sequences. Two structures are described: the Grb2-SH2 domain in complex with PSpYVNVQN Ê at 1.5 A; and the Grb2-SH2 domain in complex with mAZ*-pY-(aMe)pYÊ N-NH2 pseudo-peptide, at 2 A. Both are compared to an unliganded Ê SH2 structure determined at 2.7 A which, interestingly enough, forms a dimer through two swapping subdomains from two symmetry-related molecules. The nanomolar af®nity of the mAZ-pY-(aMe)pY-N-NH2 pseudo-peptide for Grb2-SH2 is related to new interactions with nonconserved residues. The design of Grb2-SH2 domain inhibitors that prevent interaction with tyrosine kinase proteins or other adaptors like Shc or IRS1 should provide a means to interrupt the Ras signaling pathway. Newly synthesized pseudo-peptides exhibit nanomolar af®nities for the Grb2-SH2 domain. It will then be possible to design new inhibitors with similar af®nity and simpler chemical structures.

Crystal Structures of Grb2-SH2 Domain Complexes

Introduction
Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes and their regulation are essential in the mechanisms of signal transduction pathways. Deregulation of these pathways has dramatic effects, especially in tumorigenesis. Cellular anarchic proliferation, observed in some breast and ovarian cancers as well as in leukaemia, has been related to the dysfunction of the Ras signaling pathway.1 One of the ®rst steps of intracellular signal transduction is the recognition of a tyrosinephosphorylated target by the SH2 domain of Grb2. Overexpression of Grb2 has recently been related to liver tumorigenesis in mice2 and human breast cancer cells.3 Thus, interruption of signal at the level of Grb2-SH2 could serve as a useful strategy for the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases.4 Many laboratories intend to design new inhibitors with phosphorylated sequence residues.5,6 Two known domains interact speci®cally with phosphorylated tyrosine: phospho-tyrosine binding domains (PTB) and the Src-homology 2 domain (SH2). Both domains have been studied extensively. Over a dozen structures of PTB domains have been elucidated. Even more structures of SH2 domains exist in their unliganded form or in complex with peptides or pseudo-peptides. SH2 domains were found in a great variety of signaling proteins.7 All SH2 domains share the same topology with a central antiparallel b-sheet, ¯anked by two helices.8 The binding site topology of SH2 domains excludes the binding of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues. Their recognition motifs involve phosphorylated tyrosine (pY) residues and subsequent amino acids on the C-terminal side with speci®c recognition depending on the nature of amino acid 2 or 3 relative to the pY residue. Phosphopeptides with a speci®city at 3 tend to interact in an extended conformation with the surface of SH2 domains.8 In Grb2, the presence of TrpEF1(W121) prevents the linear recognition of phosphopeptides at the surface of the SH2 domain. This forces the adoption of a U-shape, as shown by X-ray9 and NMR structures.10 Therefore, from the consensus sequence pYXNX, the speci®city is not given by the residue at position pY  3 but by pY  2. Among many potential targets, the Grb2-SH2 domain recognizes tyrosine kinase receptors and other adaptors, such as Shc,11 with a very high af®nity. Two sequences in the Shc adaptor have been identi®ed as recognition sequences for Grb2: (315PSYVNVQN322);12 (236DHQYYND242).13 SH2 domains have received particular attention from the pharmaceutical companies and several peptides or peptidomimetics with potential therapeutic activity have been prepared.6,14 Some of them showed inhibition activity on the growth of HER2-dependent tumor cells.15 Most of these inhibitors have been designed by molecular modeling using the crystal structure of the complex Grb2-SH2/KPFpYVNV and sequential modi®-

cations of the recognition sequence Cap-pY-X  1X  2-X  3, with Cap being a protecting group of the amino-terminal residue. One of the most potent peptides was synthesized by Garcia-Etchveria16 with a mAZ-pYXN-NH2 tetrapeptide, where X is a hydrophobic a,a-disubstituted cyclic a-amino acid designed to interact with the TrpEF1(W121) residue. A semi-rigid compound has been designed by Caravatti et al.,17 with an amino pyrimidine at position pY  2 and a rigid aromatic ring at pY  1. Another approach was to take bene®t from the proximity of the amino and carboxy termini to synthesize cyclic molecules. This reduces the number of degrees of freedom for a given molecule to the point that a non-phosphorylated compound has been shown to bind with micromolar af®nity.18,19 The structure of Grb2 is composed of one SH2 domain facing two neighboring SH3 domains. Here, we describe the 3D structures of the unliganded Grb2-SH2 domain and of two complexes with the following: (i) peptide 1, PSpYVNVQN derived from hp52Shc315-322 sequence; and (ii) pseudo-peptide 2, of chemical sequence mAZ-pY(aMe)pY-N-NH2 derived from the hp52Shc239-241 sequence. The latter was synthesized using X-ray structure-based modeling,20,21 with the insertion of aMe-phosphotyrosine at position 1 aiming at strengthening electrostatic and van der Waals interactions.22 The structure of the complex clearly demonstrates the importance of both phosphate groups and van der Waals contacts with the CD loop (according to the nomenclature used by Eck et al.23), especially with residue GlnbD3(Q106).

Results
Unliganded Grb2-SH2 domain The data presented here reveal that the unliganded SH2 domain contains swapping subdomains, with the point of rotation at TrpEF1(W121). Consequently, the EF loop folds as an extended chain. The classical domain is reconstituted by a symmetry-related molecule (Figure 1). Therefore, the peptide recognition site is formed by two different molecules. This Grb2-SH2 domain swapping has been observed in a Grb2-SH2 peptide complex,24 and cannot therefore be attributed to the absence of ligand. This could be related to the crystallization protocol. The unliganded crystals are the only ones obtained without heating the protein solution prior to crystallization as observed that the SH2 domain was precipitated by heating when not complexed. The interface between the two swapping domains is almost entirely hydrophobic, as seen in Figure 1. This can explain the ability of the C-terminal helix to open as it is not constrained by hydrogen bonds, which represent a high energy barrier to overcome. Domain swapping has been reported for the SH3 domain of Eps8.25 Like the Grb2-SH2 domain presented here, Eps8-SH3 was expressed as a fusion protein with Gst. It is well known that Gst has a tendency to

1169 hydrogen bonds with GlnbD3(Q106). The sidechain of PhebC8(101) is poorly de®ned but seems to enter the cavity. Regarding the 1GHU structures, the different positions of PhebC8(F101) clearly cluster in two classes. One is superimposed on our PhebC8(F101) position. In this case, the hydrogen bonds between GlnBG6(Q144) and GlnbD3(Q106) are present. The other position of PhebC8(F101) is equivalent to those of the 1FHS structures. It enters the cavity and there are no hydrogen bonds any longer between GlnBG6(Q144) and GlnbD3(Q106).

PSpYVNVQN hp52Shc315-322 derived sequence in complex with the Grb2-SH2 domain A structure of Grb2-SH2 in complex with a Shcderived peptide (DDPSpYVNVQNLDK) has been solved by NMR.10 Only residues located in the b turn, i.e. pYVNV, gave rise to enough NOEs to be observed in the 2D spectrum. In our crystallographic structure, the electron density clearly shows residues PSpYVNV, but only the main chain of the QN residues at the carboxy terminus is observed. The proline residue at the amino-terminal extremity of the Shc-derived peptide does not show any interaction with the SH2 domain or any symmetry-related molecule. The carbonyl group of serine at position pY À 1 presents a bi®d hydrogen bond with the conserved ArgaA2(R67) (Figure 2(a)2). Each of the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group, except the phenolic oxygen atom O4, is bound two or three times to an acceptor: O1 is bound to SerBC2(S90) and a water molecule; O2 has a link to conserved ArgbB5(R86) and ArgaA2(R67); O3 is bound to the NH2 of ArgbB5(R86), to SerbB7(S88) and SerbC3(S96). Valine in position pY  1 (Figure 2(b)2) displays van der Waals interactions with PhebD5(F108), TrpEF1(W121) and GlnbD3(Q106). Its peptidic amide group is bound to the carbonyl group of HisbD4(H107). Nd2 of asparagine in position pY  2 (Figure 2(c)2) interacts with the carbonyl groups of LysbD6(K109) and LeubE4(L120), and Od1 interacts with the NH peptidic group of LysbD6(K109). Ca and Cb of Asn  2 are in van der Waals contact with TrpEF1(W121), which is responsible for the type I b turn conformation of the inhibitor peptides. Valine in position pY  3 is close to LysbD6(K109), whereas the C-terminal glutamine and asparagine residues point toward the solvent. TrpEF1(W121) of the SH2 domain, which has the same orientation in most of the unliganded structures, presents a different conformation in the Shc-peptides-SH2 domain complexes. The aromatic moiety is rotated 120  clockwise and now caps Asn  2, reinforcing the complex (Figures 2(b) and (c), and 3). ArgBG4(R142) rotates accordingly, its guanidinium head being stacked on TrpEF1(W121). This involves the movement of the entire BG loop, which comes closer to the CD loop. Thus, it forms hydrogen bonds through water mol-

induce dimerization of the protein partner. Further investigation should clarify whether this has a biological relevance or is an artifact due to the isolated SH2 domain. In order to be able to compare our unliganded SH2 domain structure with other complexes, the structure formed by the swapping domains coming from the two symmetry-related molecules is considered as the reference. Nine structures of the Grb2-SH2 domain have been solved. Among them, only two are unliganded structures and both have been resolved by NMR; 1GHU,26 and 1FHS.27 These two structures Ê present an average rms deviation on Ca of 1.3 A with our reconstituted unliganded structure and Ê 1.1 A between themselves. When comparing our unliganded structure with the 24 structures from 1GHU and the 18 structures from 1FHS, it can be seen that the main differences are located at the BC and BG loops, which form the pY to pY  2 binding pockets. All residues that are poorly de®ned in our crystallographic structure are very disordered in the NMR structures. TrpEF1(W121), which is responsible for the pY  2 speci®city of Grb2, has the same orientation in 1GHU. In the 1FHS structures, this residue is poorly de®ned, making the comparison very dif®cult. The predominant position seems to be a rotamer of TrpEF1(W121) frequently encountered in the Grb2-SH2 complex structures. In the absence of a bound peptide, ArgBG4(R132) is not stabilized and has high B factors with little or no density for the guanidinium moiety. The entire BG loop is poorly de®ned in the electron density, the only contacts with the rest of the domain being two hydrogen bonds between GlnBG6(Q144) and GlnbD3(Q106) and two van der Waals contacts (Figure 2(b)1). Those hydrogen bonds are not present in 1FHS structures, in which the BG loop is further away from the SH2 domain, thereby opening the secondary binding site, creating a cavity. GlnBG6(Q144) is too far away to form

It was postulated that the negative charge of the phosphate group of aMe-phosphorylated tyrosine in position 1 would be paired with the positive NH group of ArgBG4(R142) (Figure 4).

1171 The main difference with modeling21 is the disÊ placement of the SH2 domain BG loop by 2 A due to the interaction with the mAZ-pY-(aMe)pY-NNH2 peptide. This movement, in turn affects the conformation of the CD loop. Arising from this displacement, Ca FhebC8(F101) is displaced by Ê $2 A, whereas the moiety is moved away by Ê $5 A.

Discussion
Specificity of tryptophan EF1(W121) from Grb2-SH2 domain It was expected from the structure of Grb220 that TrpEF1(W121) would prevent binding of linear peptides due to steric hindrance with residues in positions 3 and 5 of a peptide in an extended conformation. This is in agreement with results from ¯uorescent studies.28 The ®rst structure of a complex between the SH2 domain and the KPFpYVNV peptide derived from BCR-Abl9 demonstrated clearly that the phosphopeptide adopts a U shape, although only the central residues were visible in the electron density. Also, the mutation W-EF1-T transforms the speci®city of Grb2-SH2 recognition from a pY  2 position to a pY  3 amino acid, allowing extended phosphopeptide recognition, as observed in the Src-SH2 domain.29 In the present work (Figure 3), the rotation of TrpEF1(W121) by 120  , as observed in the complexes with the two peptides, allows for the capping of Asn  2, thus reinforcing the stabilization of the complex through van der Waals contacts. mAZ (3-aminobenzoylcarbonyl) acting as an N-terminal protecting group It has been suggested30 that the presence of a mAZ protecting group at the amino extremity of a peptide would reinforce interactions with the Grb2-SH2 domain, both through the amino and the aromatic moiety. In the crystal structure of mAZ-pY-(aMe)pY-N-NH2 in complex with the Grb2-SH2 domain, it appears that the N-terminal protecting group mAZ, and especially the metaamino group of the aromatic ring, does not play an essential role in the interactions between the two partners. To con®rm this view, other N-terminal protecting groups such as Z (benzyloxycarbonyl) or Ac (acetyl), which both present the advantage of an easier chemical synthesis, were tested (Table 1). The similar binding af®nity of peptide Z-pY(aMe)pY-N-NH2 (Kd 2.5 nM), lacking the metaamino group of mAZ, and of peptide Ac-pY(aMe)pY-N-NH2, without an N-terminal aromatic group (Kd 3.0 nM), indicates that the intramolecular H-bond between the amino group of mAZ and the phosphate group does not contribute to the peptide af®nity signi®cantly. Thus, the N-terminal residue of our series of molecules plays a minor role in the Grb2-SH2 domain recognition, in

atoms of the phosphate group are bound to ArgBG4(R142) (Figure 2(b)3). O1 is linked to SerBG3(S141), AsnBG5(N143) and a water molecule; O2 is bound to NH2 of ArgBG4(R142) and to one water molecule; O3 is linked to ArgBG4(R142) via its backbone amide group and its guanidinium head NH. The aromatic ring is engulfed in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of PhebC8(F101), PhebD5(F108), TrpEF1(W121) and, to a lesser extent, Cg of GlnbD3(Q106). The amide proton of pY  1 is hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl group of HisbD4(H107). The oxygen atoms of the phosphate group of pTyr(0) as well as the atoms of asparagine in position 2 are involved in the same interactions as observed in the peptide 1-Grb2-SH2 complex with an additional water molecule. The NH2 at the Cterminal end of the peptide is internally hydrogen bonded to the carbonyl group of pY(0) residue. The mAZ chemical group is internally bound through its amino group to two oxygen atoms (O1 and O4) of the pY(0) phosphotyrosine residue. The aromatic moiety is parallel with the guanidinium group of ArgaA2(R67) but not completely stacked. The carbonyl group of the carbamate group has a bi®d link to ArgaA2(R67) (Figure 2(a)3). The two SH2 domains of the crystal asymmetric unit present the same set of interactions with the mAZ-pY-(aMe)pY-N-NH2 peptide; the rmsd value Ê between molecule A and B is 0.35 A. In molecule A, the pseudo-peptide is surrounded by the solvent, whereas in molecule B it is sandwiched with a BH molecule. Although there are intermolecular interactions, this does not affect the intramolecular contacts.

contrast to compounds described by researchers from the Novartis Pharmaceutical Company.30 Mapping the pY1 binding site In order to increase the binding af®nity of our compounds, we modi®ed the pY  1 residue to achieve a high level of speci®city. The presence of a tyrosine repeat in the sequence of Shc warranted a test of various compounds with a tyrosine residue in position 1 of the consensus sequence pYXN. The af®nity of the peptide mAZ-pYYNNH2 is tenfold weaker as compared to the Shcpeptide 1. Gay et al. have shown that a heptamer peptide with two adjacent phosphorylated tyrosine residues displayed a 25-fold greater af®nity than the monophosphorylated analog.31 We synthesized the mAZ-pY-pY-N-NH2 peptide,21 which exhibits a 2.5-fold increase in af®nity as compared to its monophosphorylated pYYN analog (Table 1), but is still less ef®cient than the Shc-peptide 1. Under the hypothesis that the orientation of the pY  1 side-chain should be constrained to adopt the proper conformation, it was conjectured that amethylation would restrict the backbone of pY  1, reinforcing the type I b-turn conformation of the peptide.21 Indeed, the af®nity of the methylated compound presents a 30-fold increase as compared to that of the non-methylated analog. Although this is the best-known af®nity observed so far for the Grb2-SH2 domain (2 nM), it amounts to only a ninefold increase as compared to the Shc-peptide 1. This can be explained by comparing the pY  1 binding site of the three structures from the present work (Figure 2(b)). In the unliganded structure, the BG loop is quite loose, having limited anchorage with the rest of the domain (two hydrogen bonds between GlnBG6(Q144) and GlnbD3(Q106), one van der Waals contact between GlnBG6(Q144) and GlnbD3(Q106), and one van der Waals contact between IleBG8(I146) and PhebC8(F101)). This explains the poor electron density and high temperature factors. In the peptide 1-SH2 complex, the

rotation of TrpEF1(W121) and ArgBG4(R142) brings the BG loop closer to the SH2 domain, thus allowing hydrogen and van der Waals contacts with the N  1 residue and the CD loop via four water molecules. These water molecules seem to act as a zipper, involving GlnBG6(Q144)GlnbD3(Q106) interactions (Figure 2(b)2) tightly ®xing the BG loop in position and explaining the high af®nity of the peptide. In the peptide 2-SH2 complex, aMepY was expected to ®ll the cavity, thereby stabilizing the loop. Even if this is partly true, as can be seen in Figure 2(b)3 with the high number of additional hydrogen bonds, the presence of the tyrosine residue modi®es the pY  1 binding pocket drastically. The additional phosphate group generates a large movement of the BG Ê loop, displacing it 1.7 A away from its position in the peptide 1-SH2 complex. In a correlated moveÊ ment, the CD loop comes 1 A closer to the SH2 domain, enlarging the cavity between the two loops. GlnBG6(Q144) and GlnbD3(Q106) move apart, allowing PhebC8(F101) to insert and form the hydrophobic pocket with PhebD5(F108) and TrpEF1(W121). This new position of PhebC8(F101), which is observed only in NMR structures,10,26,27 is not due to steric constraints, the SH2 domain being surrounded by the solvent in this region. The AsnBG5(N143) and IlebD3(I146) positions are modi®ed and form the new contacts with the pY  1 phosphate group and with PhebC8(F101). Residue AspbD1(D104), which is in contact with water molecules in the peptide 1-SH2 complex is stacked onto the CD loop, forming hydrogen bonds between both Od1 and Od2, and the carbonyl group of AsnCD7(N103). GlnbD3(Q106), which loses its contact with GlnBG6(Q144), adopts a new conformation; the side-chain turns to let PhebC8(F101) enter the cavity. This new position is maintained only by van der Waals interactions with PhebC8(F101) and with pY  1 from peptide 2 (Figure 2(b)3). The only Grb2-SH2 complex structure showing this rearrangement of PhebC8(F101) is that determined by Ogura et al (Grb2-SH2/ DDPSpYVNVQNLDK).10 Therefore, we compared both structures. The rms over main-chain atoms is Ê 1.4 A. The main chains of the CD and BG loops are very close to our peptide 2-SH2 main chains, but the side-chains are not oriented in a similar way. This is not surprising, as in the NMR structure the residue at the pY  1 position is valine, which is short enough to keep the BG loop side-chains inside the cavity. Concerning the CD loop, PhebC8(F101) is superimposed on ours, breaking the GlnBG6(Q144)-GlnbD3(Q106) contact, GlnbD3(Q106) being unmodi®ed. This is made possible by the movement of PhebD5(F108) in the NMR structure. The aromatic ring of this residue is perpendicular to that in the mAZ-pY(aMe)pYNNH2 complex. In the peptide 2-SH2 structure, PhebD5(F108) is stacked on the aromatic ring of the pY  1 phosphotyrosine residue, which prohibits this movement.

1173 Acnc and residues PhebD5(F108) and GlnbD3(Q106).33 They showed that the Ac-pYAc6c-N-NH2 peptide has a 20-fold higher af®nity for Grb2-SH2 as compared to Ac-pYVN-NH2, with Ac6c and Val  1 making eight and seven van der Waals contacts, respectively. Consequently, in order to optimize the af®nity of a phosphopeptide for the Grb2-SH2 domain, it appears important to increase (i) van der Waals contacts with the CD loop, and (ii) hydrogen bonds with the BG loop, particularly with the positively charged NH of ArgBG4(R142) and the 2 hydroxyl group of SerBG3(S141). As can be seen in Figure 6, the mAZ-pY(aMe)pYN-NH2 peptide already ®ts the binding pocket well but there is still a protrusion pointing toward GlnbD3(Q106). The orientation of aMe as well as this un®lled cavity suggest that replacing aMe by aCH2OH might allow the presence of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and Ne of GlnbD3(Q106), and therefore may increase the af®nity. This hypothesis would imply a movement of the GlnbD3(Q106) side-chain. In the present structure, Oe of GlnbD3(Q106) is involved only in van der Waals contacts, therefore it is free to accommodate new interactions. Ongoing studies aim at replacing the amino acids by metabolically stable mimetics. In order to obtain phosphatase-resistant peptides, the phosphate group of (aMe)pY  1 was replaced by a carboxylate or a carboxymethyl group.21 Such

In light of this comparison, it is hard to understand the importance of the methyl group addition to the pY  1 phosphotyrosine residue. In order to explain why the addition of the methyl group causes a 30-fold increase of af®nity, all the Grb2SH2 complex structures from the RCSB PDB were superimposed (Figure 5). It appears that the position of GlnbD3(Q106) (in red in Figure 5) from our peptide 2-SH2 complex structure is different from all the others. It is no longer hydrogen bonded with GlnBG6(Q144) but gives rise to van der Waals contacts with PhebC8(F101) and the methyl group of (aMe)pY (Figure 2(b)3). This could explain the af®nity increase for the pY(aMe)pYN peptide as compared to pYpYN. We can assume that in the absence of the methyl group, GlnbD3(Q106) is not constrained. In all the PDB structures, there is a van der Waals contact between Cg2 of Val  1 and Cb of GlnbD3(Q106), whereas in our peptide 2-SH2 structure, it is replaced by two van der Waals contacts. One between aMe and NH2 of GlnbD3(Q106) and one between Cd1 from the pY  1 aromatic ring and Cg of GlnbD3(Q106). This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that aMe points in the same direction as the C29-C34 bond of the 1-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (Ac6c) from the 1CJ1 structure.32 Garcia-Echeverria et al. showed that the af®nity of Ac-pY-Acnc-N-NH2 peptides are related to the number of van der Waals contacts between the

1174 substitutions resulted in a 15-fold decrease of peptide binding af®nity. The lower af®nity may be linked to the mono-ionizing carboxylate group. In our crystal structure, the oxygen atoms of the phosphate group of pY (1) form multiple hydrogen bonds with the residues of the Grb2-SH2 domain. The loss of a negative charge in the acid function lowers the capacity of the inhibitors to interact with the residues of Grb2-SH2. This successful example of peptidomimetic design is a ®rst step towards the development of more potent, low molecular mass compounds able to inhibit the cellular Ras activation pathway. It constitutes a progress in our efforts to identify inhibitors of the Grb2-SH2 domain suitable for pharmacological investigations.

Crystal Structures of Grb2-SH2 Domain Complexes Peptide synthesis Syntheses of phosphopeptides were carried out by the solid-phase procedure on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 431A peptide synthesizer with ABI small-scale 9-¯uoroenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) strategy. The peptide PSpYVNVQN issued from the Shc sequence at Tyr317 was synthesized by the method described by Ottinger et al.35 The C-terminal ®ve suitably protected residues were introduced successively to the HMP resin by classical dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCC/HOBt) coupling and the Fmoc protecting groups were removed by 20 % (v/v) piperidine. The Fmoc-pTyrOH, with a free phosphate group, was then coupled by tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexa¯uorophosphate (BOP)/HOBt/N,N-dissopropylethylamine (DIEA). The following two residues were introduced by the same BOP coupling method. The synthesis of the pseudo-peptides was performed as described.21 The Fmoc-Asn(Trt)OH was coupled to the Fmoc pre-deprotected Rink MBHA amide resin. The Fmoc-(aMe)pTyr(MDPSE2)-OH and the Fmoc-pTyr(MDPSE2)-OH, with the phosphate protected by MDPSE groups36 were then introduced by ¯uoro-N,N,NH ,NH -tetramethylformamidinium hexa¯uorophosphate (TFFH)/DIEA coupling37 due to the steric hindrance induced by the methyl group of the (aMe)pTyr residue. For the peptide mAZ-pTyr(aMe)pTyr-Asn-NH2, the N-terminal group was coupled in the form of the active ester Boc-mAZ-ONp.30 For the other two peptides, the Fmoc deprotected peptidyl resins were capped with the benzyl chloroformate Z-Cl or acetic anhydride Ac2O. The ®nal peptides were cleaved from the resins and the protecting groups were removed by a solution of tri¯uoroacetic acid (TFA)/triisopropylsilane (TIPS)/water (9.5:2.5:2.5 by vol.). It was further puri®ed by semi-preparative HPLC on a Nucleosil C18 column (Vydac, 5 mm, 4.6 250 mm) with linear gradients of mobile phase consisting of solutions A (0.1 % (v/v) TFA in water) and B (0.09 % TFA in 70 % aqueous acetonitrile solution). The structure of peptides was con®rmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

Materials and methods
Cloning and expression of Grb2-SH2 protein The cDNA corresponding to residues 60-151 of Grb2 (with an additional four N-terminal residues, Gly-SerMet-Ala) was ampli®ed by PCR with primers 5H ATGAAACCCATGGCGTGGTTTTTTGGCAAAATCCCCAGA-3H and 5H -CTGTGGTACCTGTTATATGTCCCGCAGGAATATCTGCTG-3H . The NcoI and HindIII cleaved fragment was cloned into the expression vector pGEXTT (derived from pGEX-2T; Pharmacia, France). The particular feature of this vector lies in the sequence encoded between GST and the fusion partner that contains two thrombin cleavage sites separated by a nine amino acid residue linker.34 After DNA sequence con®rmation, the plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21-DE3 cells and induced by 250 mM IPTG, with 100 mg/ml of ampicillin, for ®ve hours at 28  C. Cells were centrifuged at 7000 g for 20 min and frozen at À80  C.

Purification The cell pellet (20 g) from a six litre culture in Fernbach was sonicated in 120 ml of lysis buffer A (16 mM Na2HPO4, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.0)). Addition of 0.1 % (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then a 5Â dilution in buffer B (16 mM Na2HPO4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA (pH 7.0)) were applied before centrifugation at 7000 g. Supernatant was then applied to a 10 ml column of glutathione (GST) attached to cross-linked agarose (Sigma, G4510). The column was washed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and the protein eluted from the column with 10 mM reduced glutathione (Sigma, G4251) in the same buffer. Fractions containing the pure Gst-SH2 protein were pooled (160 ml at 2.3 mg/ml). It was then digested for three hours at 28  C in the presence of ten units of thrombin (Diagnostica Stago) per milligram of GST-SH2. The solution was applied to an ion-exchange column Source 15Q (Amersham Biotech) and 120 mg of the pure SH2 was obtained in the ¯ow-through. Finally, the solution was dialyzed against a 50 mM succinate buffer (pH 6.0). The protein was characterized using N-terminal sequence determination and mass spectrometry.

Competition assay Precoated streptavidin plates (Boehringer) were incubated with 100 ml/well of biotin-Aha-PSpYVNVQN peptide (100 nM concentration in PBS buffer) overnight at 4  C. Nonspeci®c binding was blocked with PBS, 3 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) during four hours at 4  C. Competitors were incubated, at the appropriate concentrations, in PBS, 0.01 % (v/v) Tween 20, 3 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin containing 40 ng of GST-Grb2 protein (100 ml/well) during one night at 4  C. Revelation is performed, after anti-GST (Transduction laboratories; 1/500 in PBS, 0.01 % Tween 20, 3 % bovine serum albumin) and peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse (Amersham; incubation 1/1000 in PBS, 0.01 % Tween 20, 3 % bovine serum albumin) incubations, using TMB solution (Interchim). After coloration was stopped with 10 % (v/v) H2SO4 absorbance, at 550 nm was measured. Dose response relationships were constructed by non-linear regression of the competition curves with Origin 40 software.

Crystal Structures of Grb2-SH2 Domain Complexes Crystallization of unliganded and complexed forms of the Grb2-SH2 domain Thin plate crystals of unliganded SH2 were obtained in PEG4000 solution. In order to optimize the crystallization, glycerol was added and crystals of size 0.35 mm Â 0.35 mm Â 0.12 mm were obtained in 6 % (w/v) PEG4000, 22 % (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 6.0). All attempts to cryo-freeze crystals of unliganded SH2 failed. Therefore, data had to be quickly recorded with crystals mounted in a capillary. Attempts at soaking peptides 1 and 2 in crystals of unliganded SH2 domain failed. Therefore, the complexes were co-crystallized using a molar ratio of SH2 domain to phosphopeptide of 1:1.5. Crystals were observed but were of poor quality unless the solution of the SH2-peptide complex was heated at 50  C for ten minutes before crystallization.9 For the peptide 1 complex, the best crystals were obtained in 2 M (NH4)2HPO4, 4 % (w/v) PEG400, 50 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.0) with 46 mg/ml of SH2 domain (solution A). Crystals as large as 0.6 mm Â 0.2 mm Â 0.2 mm were obtained repeatedly and used for data collection. For the peptide 2 complex, crystallization was hampered by polycrystallinity due to phase separation. The

1175
best conditions were 2.3 M (NH4)2HPO4, 4 % (w/v) PEG400, 50 mM sodium cacodylate and 19 mg/ml of SH2 domain (solution B). Crystals of size 0.3 mm Â 0.1 mm Â 0.1 mm were isolated from twins. Data collection X-ray diffraction data for the unliganded SH2 domain and the two complexes are given in Table 2. For peptide 2, crystals were frozen into a cryoprotectant solution (25 % (v/v) glycerol in solution B) and then transferred in a stream of liquid nitrogen at 100 K. All data were integrated with DENZO38 and SCALEPACK.39 Data statistics are given in Table 2. Structure determination and refinements Using coordinates of the uncomplexed SH2 domain (Parke Davis, personal communication) and program AMoRe,40 the unliganded and Shc-complexed structures were positioned in the asymmetric unit. For the peptide 2-SH2 complex, we used the coordinates reported by Ettmayer et al.19 and the no rotate option of AMoRe to localize the molecules within the asymmetric unit and then the rigid body function for the translation.

Some regions of the electron density were reinterpreted after omit maps and Fourier difference. The two molecules of the asymmetric unit of the peptide 2-SH2 complex were re®ned independently. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The RCSB Protein Data Bank accession numbers of the three structures are 1JYU, 1JYR and 1JYQ for the unliganded SH2, the SH2-peptide 1 complex and SH2-peptide 2 complex, respectively.
