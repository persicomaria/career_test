The reaction of 4,5_methylenephenanthrene (MHZ) with alkali metal has been investigated using NMR-, spectroscopy. The primarily formed radical anion is unstable, ESR- I optical absorption and fluorescence especially on association with aikaii metal ion, and decomposes to form 4.5-methylenephecanthrenyl carbanion (MH-) and 9.1%dihydro-4, &methylenephenanthrene (HzMH2). The carbanions MH- and H2MH' have been studied as well as the mechanism of the reaction in which they are formed.

INTRODUCTION

A spectroscopic investigation has been carried out of carbanions derived from aromatic molecules. In this not&results are reported on the reaction of 4,5-metbylenephenanthrene (MHz)
with alkali metal'[a].

The reduction of MHz first produces the radical anion Ml32 [2,3], which is unstable in the presence of unreacted hydrocarbon, and decomposes to form the carbanion (MH-) and a protonation product. In the course of the reaction the carbanion of 9,10-dihydro-4,5-methylenephenanthrene (H$UH-) is generated. This has been shown by us using NMR-, optical absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.

in the elucidation of the spectra of the methylenephenanthrenyl ions, the spectra of fluorenyl carbanions (FH-) were very helpful; these spectra will also be discussed.

2. RESULTS 2.1. iV&ZRspectroscopy The NMR spectrum of a 0.3 molar solution of MH2 partly reduced with potassium reveals the presence of several diamagnetic products. After exhaustive reaction, both in ethereal solvents and in liquid ammonia, only one species remains (fig. la). From integration ratios it is expected to be H2MH'. Further verification could be obtain&d by comparing the chemical shifts with those of the carbanions of fluorene [4] and of methyl substituted fluorene molecules (table 1). MH- is one of the stable diamagnetic reaction products. This ion is prepared with sodium amide in liquid ammonia. The spectrum, measured at -40°C, is shown in fig. lb. Comparison of fig. la and b shows that the difference in chemical sh_ifts of the protons in MH- and H2MH- is roughly 0.5 ppm which can be lunderstood from the decrease of the number of ring-currents by one when two CH2-groups are introduced. This allows one to distinguish between the reaction products even under low resolution (non spinning sampie, presence of paramagnetic ions). The spectrum of MH- (fig. lb) consists of two singlet peaks (9, lo-protons at 7.8 ppm and the bridge proton at 6.2 ppm); the remaining part can be interpreted as an ABX spectrum in which one of the two AB-subspectra has collapsed into one

single line. This will happen if 2 D+ = JAB (see ref. [5]); lines 6 and 4 then coincide while iines 2 and 8 have zero intensity. The coupling ccc&ants and chemical shifts have been obtained from solutions of mixtures of MH- and H2MH-. The linewidth is much smaller than in fig. lb, while the separate spectra can easily be discerned 2.2. Optical absorption andfluorescence The optical absorption and fluorescence spectra gave an additional proof for the formation of both carbanions. As the reduction proceeds the spectrum displays, besides the band of the ion MH- at 20.4 kX [S], a broad absorption at 21.5 kK at a sharp one at 27.7 kK. In vieK of the similarity between the latter bands and the fluorenyl absorption spectrum they are assigned to the ion H2MH-. This conclusion agrees with the data derived from fluorescence spectra measured in the course of the reaction First a band at 17.4 kK appears, later on followed by bands at 18.5 and 19.8 kK. 0nly the band at 17.4 kK is caused by MH' as was shown by preparing this ion in a reaction of MH2 with the &negative ion of anthracene (A2-). In this reaction a proton is transferred according to A2- + MH2 = AH+ MH- . The fluorescence emitted (u = 17.4 kK) is assigned to MH'; the carbanion AH-' does not display an emission band at room temperature [7].

CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS

No ESR signal of the radical ion MH- can be detected when the concentration of unreacted hydrocarbon is high. Analogous to fluorene [a, 91, with about the same pKa value as methylenephenanthrene [lo], we expect that the decomposition of Ml-l2 will be accompanied by the formation of MH- and a hydrated product. The protonation product apparently is 9,10-dihydro-4,5-methylenephenanthrene. In the NMR spectrum lines are observed at 7.0, 3.6 and 3.0 ppm with relative intensities 6 : 2 : 4. These lines are assigned to the aromatic-, the bridge- and the 9, lo-protons. In the presence of large amounts of the parent compound MH2 the ratio of the concentration of H2MH2 and MI-I- is approxi._nately 1 : 2, which can be expressed by the reaction 3MH2 + 2e - 2MH- -t-H2MH2. (1) However, as soon as the concentrations of H2MH2 formed and MH2 left are roughly equal, the NMR spectrum of H2MH- turns up. The dynamic equilibrium H2MH2 + MI-I-===H2KI+ MH2 (2)

tween MH2 and H2MH2, reported by Janata et al. [2], and the energy of the lowest vacant orbital in these compounds (using the HMO approximation and Coulson and Crawford parameters [II] for the CH2-group) and in MH- demonstrate that the eLectron affinity of H2MH2 is so small, that MH- will be reduced preferably.

4. CONCLUDING

REMARKS

provides an explanation for this result. The equilibrium constant of eq. (2) is determined by the difference in acidity of H2MH2 and MHz. From the NMR spectra we conclude that MH2 is the more acidic compound, while APK, is estimated to be at least unity. This explains why metallation of H2MH2 can take place without protonation of another aromatic ring. MH2 is partly recovered from the reaction products, so that eq. (1) can, more properly, be described by: (3 - x)MH2 + 2e - (2 - x)MI-I+ (1 - x)H2MH2 + (x)H2MH(3)

When more than one equivalent cf potassium has been consumed, the solution contains as well as MH- and H2MH' the dianion radical MIX(black), the ESR spectrum of which can be recorded [3]. The lines are broadened by the symmetric electron transfer reaction. in the NMR spectrum of MH' the linewidths have increased beyond detection; thus only the line pattern of H2MH- 9 as depicted in fig. la, is left. After standing for a fe-w weeks MH-- has decomposed, and a mixture of carbanions MH- and H2MH-, in which the latter prevails, remains. This is explained by a protonation reaction with the solvent as proton donor. Also, in agreement with the protonation of phenanthrene dinegative ion [ 121, the disproportionation reaction 2 HMH: - H2MH- i- MH(4) cannot be excluded. In general MH-- is protonated at the bridge position, which has the highest electron density, with formation of MH$ The rate-determining step in the metallation reaction of H2MH2 is the backformation of MH2 according to eq. (2). If the latter reaction is too slow, MH- might be reduced instead of MH2. As the dinegative ion MI-l-- reacts with weak proton donors like THF or DME to form H2MH-. the same reaction might proceed at a higher rate with a stronger donor Like H2MH2. This, however, does not influence the overall reaction (3). as all protons involved in the metallation descend from the originally present MHz, while the ultimate products are the same for both reaction paths. The reaction of MH2 with potassium is essentially of the type suggested by Eisch and Kaska [9] in the metallation of fluorene. The following reaction mechanism is proposed: Ml-l2 + MH; -MH-iHMH2 HMH2. + e - HMHi (5) (6) (7)

x is the fraction of H2MH-. The ratio of the concentration of MH- and H2MH- approaches unity when one equivalent of potassium has been consumed in the reaction with MH2. The following data support the scheme (3): (a) Even under circumstances where the fluorene radical ion is fairly stable, no ESR evidence for the existence of an ion H2MH2 has been obtained. (b) After prolonged reaction of MH2 with K in liquid ammonia, an additional peak appears at 2.6 ppm. If this signal is assigned to a CH2group of another protonation product, the concentration of this compound must be less than thirty times that of H2MH-. (c) The difference in half wave potentials be-

fashion, the ESR spectra of dilute solutions of radical ions of 4,5_methylenephenanthrene and fluorene in DME, THF and MTHF, with Li, Nz and K as counter ions, have been recorded. These spectra shciv the features of phenanthrene [2] and biphenyl [13] radica1 ions; they have limited relevance to the present investigation, and will be discussed separately. The stability of the ions depends strongly on tlne experimental conditions_ In general the stability increases in the series K < Na < Li. In MTHF the radical ion MH2 displays a potassium hyperfine spIitting, indicating the presence of an ion pair. As this ion pair is exceedingly reactive, we believe that the counter ion might facilitate the proton-abstraction process. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors wish to thank Professor A. H.
