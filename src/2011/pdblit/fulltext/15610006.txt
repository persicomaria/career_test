ABSTRACT: The receptor-binding surface of insulin is broadly conserved, reflecting its evolutionary optimization. Neighboring positions nevertheless offer an opportunity to enhance activity, through either transmitted structural changes or introduction of novel contacts. Nonconserved residue A8 is of particular interest as ThrA8 f His substitution (a species variant in birds and fish) augments the potency of human insulin. Diverse A8 substitutions are well tolerated, suggesting that the hormone-receptor interface is not tightly packed at this site. To resolve whether enhanced activity is directly or indirectly mediated by the variant A8 side chain, we have determined the crystal structure of HisA8-insulin and investigated the photo-cross-linking properties of an A8 analogue containing p-azidophenylalanine. The structure, characterized as a T3R3f zinc hexamer at 1.8 Å resolution, is essentially identical to that of native insulin. The photoactivatable analogue exhibits efficient cross-linking to the insulin receptor. The site of crosslinking lies within a 14 kDa C-terminal domain of the R-subunit. This contact, to our knowledge the first to be demonstrated from the A chain, is inconsistent with a recent model of the hormone-receptor complex derived from electron microscopy. Optimizing the binding interaction of a nonconserved side chain on the surface of insulin may thus enhance its activity.

Insulin is a small protein that functions in the hormonal control of metabolism. After proteolytic processing of a single-chain precursor (proinsulin), the hormone consists of two chains, designated A (21 residues) and B (30 residues), and is stored in the pancreatic -cell as a Zn-stabilized hexamer (1). Insulin functions in the blood as a monomer containing three R-helices and two extended segments (Figure 1A) (2-4). Because of its importance in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, insulin has attracted attention as a target of protein engineering (5). In recent years analogues have gained widespread clinical acceptance (6). Despite such empirical success, how insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR)1 is not well-understood. The IR comprises two extracellular R-subunits and two transmembrane -subunits (Figure 1B; for review, see ref 7). Binding of insulin to the R subunits activates the tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domains of -subunits, which leads in turn to a cascade of signal transduction events. Photo-cross-linking studies have demonstrated contacts between the R-subunit

of the receptor and sites in the B chain (7-10). Our study defines a novel site of photo-cross-linking in the A chain and demonstrates how this site may be utilized to enhance the potency of insulin. The site of contact in the IR is inconsistent with a high-resolution model of the hormonereceptor complex (11) proposed on the basis of electron microscopic (EM) image reconstruction at a resolution of 20 Å (12, 13). The classical receptor-binding surface of insulin is conserved among vertebrate insulins, presumably reflecting its evolutionary optimization (2, 14). Attention has thus focused on mechanisms by which substitutions at nonconserved sites may influence the biological and pharmacological properties of the hormone (15). Of particular interest is a substitution on the surface of the A chain, ThrA8 f His (arrow in Figure 1A; 16, 17). Originally observed in turkey insulin and

characteristic of fish (red letters in Figure 2; 18-21), HisA8 enhances the thermodynamic stability of insulin (17) and augments its affinity for the insulin receptor by 2-5-fold with a commensurate increase in lipogenic potency (17, 2224). Whereas a general relationship between stability and biological activity has previously been proposed (17), studies of multiple A8 analogues indicate that effects on stability and activity are uncorrelated (22, 25). Amino acids of diverse shape, size, and polarity are functionally well-tolerated (25), suggesting that this site is either not near the receptor or not tightly constrained at the receptor interface. How does HisA8 enhance the biological activity of insulin? This study addresses whether the variant A8 side chain indirectly modulates the structure of the conserved receptorbinding surface or instead introduces a novel receptor contact. Our approach has two parts. The crystal structure of HisA8insulin is first determined to visualize the conserved receptorbinding surface. The structure, characterized by molecular replacement at 1.80 Å resolution, demonstrates that substitution of ThrA8 with histidine is readily accommodated in a native-like T3R3f hexamer2 (26). The substitution does not significantly affect the conformations of the T or R protomers, their zinc-mediated assembly, or the ligand-induced T f R transition.3 To investigate the role of the A8 side chain in the hormone-receptor complex, we next prepared a photoactivatable analogue containing p-azidophenylalanine
2 The classical crystal forms of insulin contain zinc ions and are hexameric (T6, T3R3f, and R6; 26, 52, 86, 87). The structure of an isolated T2 dimer has also been determined in a Zn-free cubic lattice (88).

(Pap, inset in red in Figure 1A) at this position. Packing of PapA8 near the receptor is shown by its efficient cross-linking to the ectodomain. Surprisingly, proteolytic mapping of the covalent holoreceptor complex indicates that the site of crosslinking lies within a C-terminal 14 kDa fragment of the R-subunit. This fragment is derived from the fibronectin III homology domain (FnI) and the insert domain (ID, asterisk and black box in Figure 1B; 27). These results are not in accord with a structural model derived from EM image reconstruction in which the A8 side chain is predicted to contact the N-terminal L1 -helix (11). To our knowledge, this is the first explicit demonstration that the surface of the A chain contacts the insulin receptor as long envisaged (2, 28, 29). We propose that the ectodomain engulfs the insulin molecule to contact both its chains: HisA8 augments activity by enhancing a nonconserved interaction at a novel edge of the hormone-receptor interface. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Design of Insulin Analogues. Six analogues of human insulin (Table 1) were prepared by chain combination: HisA83 The crystallographic TR transition, an allosteric reorganization of insulin hexamers (52, 87), is remarkable for a change in the secondary structure of the B1-B8 segment from the extended (T state) to R-helix portion (R state). Segmental reorganization is coupled to changes in the conformation of GlyB8, core packing, and handedness of cystine A7-B7. The latter sulfur atoms are exposed in the T state but buried in a nonpolar crevice in the R state. The superscript Rf refers to N-terminal fraying of the B1-B19 R-helix (26). The T f R transition has been analyzed as a model for the long-range transmission of conformational change (89).

and hexamers (HisB10 f Asp) (4, 30-33). For synthetic convenience, the tA-PapA8 analogue was prepared using a porcine B chain, obtained from porcine insulin (a gift from Y. M. Feng, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China) by sulfitolysis. The human B chain S-sulfonate was likewise obtained from recombinant human insulin, generously provided by Eli Lilly and Co. (Indianapolis, IN). Synthesis of Insulin Analogues. The general protocol for solid-phase synthesis of variant insulin chains is as described previously (34). In brief, 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (0.6 mmol of amine/g; Bachem, Inc.) was used as solid support for synthesis of A chain analogues; (N-tert-butoxycarbonyl,O-benzyl)threonine-PAM resin (0.56 mmol/g; Bachem, Inc.) was used as a solid support for synthesis of B chain analogues. A manual double-coupling protocol was followed (35, 36). Protection of the p-NH2 moiety of Phe (designated Pmp) was carried out by the 2-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl group, which is stable under the conditions employed in the stepwise synthesis of A and B chain analogues. Chain recombination employed S-sulfonated A and variant B chains (approximately 2:1 by weight) in 0.1 M glycine buffer (pH 10.6) in the presence of dithiothreitol (35). Insulin analogues were isolated from the combination mixture (36) and purified as described previously (22); essentially native yields were obtained. Mass spectrometry in each case gave expected values. Conversion of p-amino-Phe to Pap in the intact hormones (10) was verified by mass spectrometry. Purity was in each case greater than 98% as evaluated by analytical reverse-phase HPLC. Electrospray mass spectra revealed no anomalous molecular masses.

insulin for structural analysis and five Pap derivatives (positions A8, B0, B16, and B25; residue B0 refers to the N-terminal extension of the B chain by one residue). To facilitate characterization of photoproducts, four Pap derivatives were modified with a biotinylamido-caproyl tag at the N-terminus of the B chain as described previously (10). Because reduction of the disulfide bridges in PmpA8-tB-DKPinsulin leads to separation of the biotin tag from the photoreactive probe (and hence following reduction of possible photo-cross-linked receptor domains on UV irradiation), an additional PapA8 analogue was prepared in which the -amino group of D-LysA1 (i.e., substituted for the native glycine at position A1) was likewise tagged with biotin. These respective tags are designated tB and tA in Table 1. HisA8-insulin was prepared using the native human B chain, whereas the DKP B chain was employed in syntheses of four Pap derivatives; "DKP" indicates substitutions that hinder formation of dimers (ProB28 f Lys and LysB29 f Pro)

Crystals were grown by hangingdrop vapor diffusion in the presence of a 1:2.5 Zn2+:protein monomer ratio and a 3.7:1 phenol:protein monomer ratio in Tris-HCl buffer as described previously (37). Drops consisted of 2 µL of protein solution (10 mg/mL in 0.02 M HCl) mixed with 2 µL of reservoir solution [0.02 M Tris-HCl, 0.05 M sodium citrate, 5% acetone, 0.03% phenol, and 0.01% zinc acetate (pH 8.4)]. Each drop was suspended over 1 mL of reservoir solution. A cosolvent (either acetone, phenol, or glycerol) was found to be essential for crystallization; in its absence, the protein forms an amorphous precipitate. Crystals (space group R3) were obtained at room temperature after 2 weeks. Data were collected from single crystals mounted in a rayon loop and flash-frozen to 100 K. Reflections from 19.2 to 1.8 Å were measured with a CCD detector system using synchrotron radiation at the Advanced Photon Source (beam line 14BMD, Argonne National Laboratories, Argonne, IL). Data were processed with DENZO (version 1.9.6) and SCALEPACK (version 1.9.6). The crystal belongs to space group R3 with the following unit cell parameters: a ) b ) 79.34 Å, c ) 34.71 Å, R ) 90°, ) 90°, and  ) 120°. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using CNS (38). Accordingly, a model was obtained using the native TR dimer [Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1TRZ following removal of all water molecules, zinc ions, and chloride ions]. A translation-function search was performed using coordinates from the best solution for the rotation function following analysis of data between 15.0 and 4.0 Å resolution. Rigid-body refinement using CNS, employing overall anisotropic temperature factors and bulksolvent correction, yielded values of 0.315 and 0.336 for R and Rfree, respectively, for data between 19.2 and 3.0 Å resolution. Between refinement cycles, 2Fo - Fc and Fo Fc maps were calculated using data to 3.0 Å resolution; a phenol molecule was built into the TRf structure using O (39). The geometry was continually monitored with PROCHECK (40); zinc ions and water molecules were built into the difference map as the refinement proceeded. Calculation of omit maps and further refinement were carried out using CNS (38) and X-PLOR (41), which implement maximumlikelihood torsion-angle dynamics and conjugate-gradient refinement. Statistics are provided in Table 2. Lectin Purification of the Insulin Receptor. The human insulin receptor (IR) was partially purified from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected to overexpress the B-splicing isoform of the human receptor (P3-A; kindly provided by D. F. Steiner) (42). Methods of cell culture and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) purification were as described previously (42). Cells were detached using Hank's-based enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Specific binding of insulin to the WGA-purified IR was verified with polyethylene glycol 8000 precipitation ¨ according to the method of Schaffer (43). The recombinant ectodomain of the IR, purified from a bacculoviral expression system (44), was kindly provided by G. D. Smith and C. Yip (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON). Receptor Binding Assays. Receptor binding assays (Table 1) were performed using a human placental membrane (45) as described previously (22).

of the competing ligand was less than 15% to prevent liganddepletion artifacts. Each determination was performed with three or four replicates; values are reported as the mean and standard deviation (Table 1). This assay underestimates activities for analogues whose affinities are more than 2-fold higher than that of native insulin (22). Photo-Cross-Linking Studies. A protocol for photo-crosslinking studies has recently been described (46). In brief, the soluble ectodomain or WGA-purified IR was mixed in the dark with photoactive insulins labeled at indicated positions at a concentration of 200 nM at 4 °C with gentle shaking overnight. Binding solutions were then transferred to a Costar assay plate (Corning Inc.) for ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Short-wave UV radiation (254 nm) generated from a Mineralight Lamp (model UVG-54, UVP, Upland, CA) was used with an optimum exposure time of 20 s and a distance from the light source of 1 cm. After cross-linking, the hormone-receptor complex was reduced with dithiothreitol (DTT) and resolved by 10 to 20% gradient SDSPAGE. The separated proteins were then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Cross-linked adducts were probed with NeutrAvidin (NAv; Pierce). To verify the identity of the R-subunit of the insulin receptor, gels were also probed with anti-IRR antiserum (IRR-N; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), which recognizes the N-terminal 20-amino acid sequence of the R-subunit (i.e., the L1 domain). Sites of cross-linking in the IR were mapped by partial proteolysis

A Novel Contact between Insulin and the Insulin Receptor to discrete regions of the R-subunit. This strategy utilizes the PapB25 derivative to provide a fingerprint of binding to the C-terminal domain of the R-subunit (10) and the PapB16 derivative as a probe of the N-terminal L1 domain (47). Partial proteolysis takes advantage of previous characterization of chymotryptic sites as described (48, 49), in particular, a protected 47 kDa N-terminal glycosylated fragment containing the L1 -helix and part of the CR domain (see below). Chymotryptic Digestion. WGA-purified receptors were cross-linked with photoactive insulins and digested at 37 °C with 100 µg/mL chymotrypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in a solution of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.11 M NaCl. Digestions were stopped at successive times by heating aliquots at 95 °C for 5 min. An equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the mixtures were treated (or not treated) with 100 mM DTT. Digestion mixtures were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with NeutrAvidin or an anti-IRR antiserum (N-20) as described above. Proteolytic mapping also permitted specific crosslinking efficiencies to be estimated on the basis of the observation of an SDS-PAGE mobility shift between native proteolytic fragments of the R-subunit and their corresponding A or B chain adducts. Except for the low-efficiency PapB0 derivative, the ratio of shifted to unshifted bands was 2030%, indicating that the efficiency of photo-cross-linking is at least this high. Efficiencies might be higher if the WGApurified IR was not completely active, since inactive receptors would only contribute to the unshifted bands. Deglycosylation of the Insulin Receptor and Chymotryptic Fragments. Chymotryptic fragments of the Pap-cross-linked IR complexes were deglycosylated with peptide-N-Glycosidase F (N-Glycanase; Prozyme). Samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% SDS and 50 mM -mercaptoethanol prior to deglycosylation. The solutions were cooled to room temperature, and nonionic detergent NP-40 (final concentration of 0.75%) and N-Glycanase (1 milliunit per microgram of receptor in the initial chymotryptic digestion) were added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. An equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer was added for SDS-PAGE. Control deglycosylation of the intact R-subunit indicated complete conversion of the 135 kDa glycoprotein band to a 98 kDa band in accord with past studies (50). Interpretation of Molecular Masses. A PapB16 insulin derivative has previously been shown to cross-link within the L1 domain (residues 1-158; 47). The electrophoretic mobility of the B16-cross-linked N-terminally glycosylated chymotryptic fragment corresponds to a molecular mass of 50 kDa; following enzymatic deglycosylation, the apparent mass is 31 kDa (including the B chain adduct). These masses suggest a fragment of ca. 250 residues containing four or five glycosylation sites (orange arrowheads in Figure 1B). The putative structure (as obtained by homology modeling; 27) predicts prominent chymotryptic sites between residues 245 and 260 in the cysteine-rich (CR) domain (YYHFQDWRCVNFSFCQ sequence), exposed on the back surface of the domain (51). Cleavage within this segment would yield (in the absence of glycosylation) 29-30 kDa fragments. C-Terminal chymotryptic fragments are identified on the

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 51, 2004 16123 basis of cross-linking to the PapB25 insulin derivative, previously shown to contact a peptide spanning residues 704-718 (10). PapB25-cross-linked chymotryptic fragments thus provide a fingerprint for cross-linking to the C-terminal tail of the R-subunit. B25-cross-linked chymotryptic fragments exhibit apparent masses of 34 and 20 kDa when glycosylated; on deglycosylation, these fragments run as 23 and 17 kDa bands, respectively (inclusive of the B chain adduct). The latter receptor fragment contains ca. 110-130 amino acids and so provides a probe for the Fn1/ID region (asterisk in Figure 1B). This chymotryptic fragment is slightly smaller than the canonical homology region (residues 590-731; 142 amino acids). The mass difference on deglycosylation (3 kDa) indicates that the fragment contains at least one N-linked carbohydrate; the Fn1/ID region contains three N-linked sites of glycosylation (residues 605, 624, and 671; Figure 1B). RESULTS Our study has two parts. The crystal structure of HisA8insulin is first determined in an effort to investigate whether transmitted changes occur in the conformation of the classical receptor-binding surface. Photo-cross-linking studies of PapA8 are then described to test whether and where the A8 side chain contacts the IR. Pap substitutions at three sites in the B chain are employed as controls. The photoactivatable side chain was introduced into an engineered insulin monomer (DKP-insulin), chosen as a template for its efficiency of synthesis, its enhanced receptor binding, and the absence of confounding self-association (4). Biotin tags were introduced during synthesis to facilitate detection of photo-cross-linked domains of the insulin receptor. Structural details of the HisA8 hexamer and statistical analyses are described in the Supporting Information. Structural Studies. HisA8-human insulin was crystallized as a T3R3f zinc hexamer4 in a lattice similar to that of rhombohedral four-Zn insulin (52). The lattice contains a TRf dimer in the asymmetric unit; the hexamer is generated by crystallographic symmetry. The structure was determined by molecular replacement. The refined model (determined to a resolution of 1.80 Å at 100 K) includes all residues in each chain and 138 water molecules. Its R factor equals 0.189, and Rfree equals 0.245; diffraction parameters, data collection statistics, and additional R factors are given in Table 2. The overall structure is similar to that of native insulin (Figure 3). The organization of the hexamer is essentially identical to that of native insulin in the same crystal form. No significant changes are observed in secondary structure, chain orientation, mode of assembly, or structure of Zn2+binding sites (Figure 4). The two Zn2+-binding sites are each well-defined without evidence of multiple ligand conformations (see the Supporting Information). As expected, in the T3 trimer, Zn2+ coordination geometry is octahedral. Ligation is mediated by three symmetry-related HisB10 side chains with Zn-N distances of 2.02 Å; the remaining coordination sites are occupied by symmetry-related water molecules with Zn-O distances of 2.43 Å and a chloride ion with a Zn-Cl

distance of 2.25 Å. In the R3f trimer, the coordination geometry is tetrahedral. Ligation is mediated by three symmetry-related HisB10 side chains with Zn-N distances of 2.06 Å; the fourth site is occupied by a chloride ion with a Zn-Cl distance 2.26 Å. The phenol-binding sites in the R3f trimer are similar to those previously described5 (Supporting Information; 26, 53). Root-mean-square deviations (rmsds) between respective main chain atoms in variant and native structures6 are 0.56 Å (T state) and 0.58 Å (R state); respective side chain rmsd values (excluding A8) are 1.32 and 1.21 Å. These values are similar to those obtained in pairwise comparison between structures of native insulin in different crystal forms (Supporting Information). The classical receptor-binding surface and hydrophobic core of insulin (2, 28) are unaffected by the A8 substitution. In particular, the conformation and environment of conserved residues IleA2, ValA3, LeuA16, TyrA19, LeuB6, LeuB11, ValB12,
5 The orientation of phenol is stabilized in part by hydrogen bonds from the phenolic hydroxyl group to the carboxyl oxygen of CysA6 (O,,,O distance, 2.43 and 2.66 Å; Protein Data Bank entries 1MPJ and 1LPH, respectively) and the nitrogen of CysA11 (O,,,N distance, 2.91 and 3.20 Å; Protein Data Bank entries 1MPJ and 1LPH, respectively); see the Supporting Information for a view of this site. 6 An estimate of the intrinsic variability among wild-type insulin crystal forms is provided by mean pairwise rms deviations, defined as the average of rmsd values obtained in systematic pairwise alignment of main chain atoms. This measure provides a baseline for assessment of rms deviations between the variant and native structures.

LeuB15, TyrB16, PheB24, PheB25, and TyrB26 are similar to those of the native T3R3f zinc hexamer. The canonical disulfide bridges are likewise unperturbed. Local conformational adjustments are nonetheless apparent near the site of substitution. The T-state protomer of HisA8-insulin contains a salt bridge (distance of 2.84 Å) between the side chain carboxylate of GluA4 and the imidazole of the variant A8 side chain (O 1-N); the native salt bridge between GluA4 and the R-amino group of A1 is broken. The A4-A8 distance predicts formation of a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond (Figure 5A). The neighboring side chain of GlnA5 exhibits two conformations.7 By contrast, the conformation of HisA8 in the R-state protomer is similar to that of ThrA8 in the native R state. In each case, no interactions are observed between A4 and A8 side chains (Figure 5B). The distance between the side chain carboxylate of GluA4 and the imidazole of the variant A8 side chain (O 1-N) is 7.25 Å.

The diagnostic distance between the 1 oxygen atom of GlnA5 and the carboxyl oxygen atom of GlyA1 is 2.75 Å; the distance between the 2 oxygen atom of GlnA5 and the hydroxyl oxygen atom of TyrA19 is 4.55 Å. In the second conformer, corresponding ( 1 and 2) dihedral angles are -80° and -164° and diagnostic distances are 4.82 and 2.76 Å, respectively.

structure of IGF-I (Figure 5C). Because diverse A8 substitutions are likely to induce variations in stability or segmental helical structure without correlation with biological activities (54), such local variations are unlikely to be functionally significant. The structure of insulin in solution resembles the crystallographic T state (3, 4). The rmsd values of HisA8-insulin in relation to homonuclear NMR models of [4E+A8H]insulin (PDB entry 1IOH; 3) are larger than deviations observed among native T- or R-state crystal structures. The HisA8 analogue employed in NMR studies (designated [4E+A8H]insulin) contained four substitutions in the B chain and lacked ThrB30 (55). Only a T-like secondary structure is observed in solution; no evidence was detected of an A4-A8 salt bridge. Although significant differences are observed relative to the crystal structure presented here (see Supporting Information), in each case an absence of transmitted structural perturbations is seen relative to respective parent structures. Mean rmsd values between respective main chain atoms are 1.81 Å (T state), whereas side chain rmsd values (excluding variant residues B1, B10, B16, B27, and B30) are 2.70 Å (Supporting Information). The range of conformations of the HisA8 side chain in solution ( 1 ) -84.2 ( 11.7° and 2 ) -16.2 ( 21.0°; average and standard deviation among 26 NMR models) is similar but not identical to those presently observed in the crystallographic R-state protomer ( 1 ) -65° and 2 ) -22°). By contrast, the crystallographic T-state

protomer exhibits a distinct value of 2 ( 1 ) -65° and 2 ) 176°) in association with the A4-A8 interaction. In accordance with an R-helical structure, the main chain ( and ) dihedral angles of HisA8 (-73.0° and -31.4°, respectively) in the T state and (-82.3° and -25.5°, respectively) in the R state are within the range of those observed in solution ( ) -84.2 ( 11.7° and  ) -16.2 ( 21.0°). It is not known whether the imprecision of the NMR ensemble reflects true physical disorder or limitations of homonuclear NMR methods. Photo-Cross-Linking Studies. To test whether residue A8 is near the IR, we synthesized an analogue containing Pap, a photoactivatable derivative of phenylalanine (56). Pap was chosen on the basis of its rigidity and small size (relative to other photoactivatable moieties), thus limiting the distance range for cross-linking. Pap was previously introduced at B25 by Kurose et al. and shown to cross-link near the C-terminus of the R-subunit of the insulin receptor8 (10). A corresponding PapB25 derivative was thus prepared to provide a fingerprint for photo-cross-linking to the C-terminal domain. Additional controls were prepared at position B16 in the classical receptor-binding surface (shown to contact
8 Kurose et al. characterized a PapB25 derivative of the truncated insulin analogue des[B26-B30]insulin-amide containing a B1 biotin tag. The Pap moiety was found to cross-link within the insert subdomain of the R-subunit (i.e., near the extreme C-terminus; 10).

the N-terminal L1 domain; 47) and as an amino-terminal extension of the B chain (PapB0). Because residues B1-B4 are dispensable for receptor binding (2), the latter was expected to cross-link only weakly.9 Although the lability of the Pap moiety limits assessment of relative activities, the p-amino-Phe precursor is stable. The Pmp forms of these analogues in each case exhibit high affinity for the IR (Table 1). Interestingly, although the tB-tagged derivative of DKPinsulin is less active than DKP-insulin, substitution of ThrA8

with Pmp increases its activity by 2-fold. Thus, diverse aromatic side chains at A8 (Pmp, His, and Trp; 57) are associated with increased receptor affinity. By contrast, Pmp
9 A similar B0 photoactivatable derivative was previously prepared by Brandenberg and colleagues (62). Although this analogue was shown to cross-link to residues 390-488 of the R-subunit, the efficiency of cross-linking was not determined. We suggest that the long and flexible tether provided by residues B0-B4 enables nonspecific low-efficiency cross-linking to distant surfaces of the IR.

Boxes b and c are control blots as in panel A. Molecular masses are in each case shown at the right.

substitution at B16 and the Pmp extension at B0 cause small decreases in the level of receptor binding. Because photocross-linking reactions are performed at high concentrations of the ligand and receptor (200 nM) relative to the native dissociation constant (ca. 0.2 nM), such changes in relative affinity do not affect efficiencies of cross-linking. Following UV irradiation, A8, B16, and B25 Pap analogues each exhibit efficient cross-linking to the isolated ectodomain and WGA-purified IR (Figure 6). At least 20% of bound probes form covalent complexes as indicated by analysis of chymotryptic digestions (see below). Photo-crosslinking is successively weakened by addition of native

insulin, or at higher ligand concentrations, IGF-I, indicating that the Pap derivatives are binding to the specific hormonebinding pocket. No competition is observed with unrelated proteins (hen egg white lysozyme or nonspecific immunoglobulins). Remarkably, cross-linking efficiency is greatest at A8. This does not imply that PapA8 is closer to the receptor than residue B16 or B25 since the photochemistry of crosslinking can be influenced by local environment (56); the presence of hydrophilic functional groups near A8, for example, might be more highly reactive with the Pap probe than a putative nonpolar interface near B16 or B25 (56). In contrast to the efficiency of cross-linking at the sites

(A and B) Corresponding NAv-detected (A) and IRR-N-detected (B) blots following the initial time course of digestion of B16-, B25-, and A8-cross-linked complexes. The time periods of digestion (0.1, 0.5, 2, and 10 min) are indicated at the top. The molecular mass of the intact R-subunit is 135 kDa (including glycosylation). Limited chymotryptic digestion liberates a 47 kDa N-terminal domain (50 kDa including the mass of the tethered B chain; lanes 1-4) and 34 kDa fragment (including the tethered B chain; lanes 5-8 in panel A) containing the C-terminal B25 contact site (704-718 peptide; 10). The A8 digestion pattern (lanes 9-12 in panel A) mirrors that of the PapB25-cross-linked complex. B16 and B25 analogues contain a biotin tag at the R-amino group of B1; the A8 analogue contains a biotin tag at D-LysA1 (see the footnote of Table 1). (C) Schematic outline of the R2 dimer showing putative structural models (L1, CR, L2, Fn0, and the N-terminal portion of Fn1/ID) and sites of preferential chymotryptic cleavage of cross-linked hormone-receptor complexes (arrows). Additional central cleavage sites are possible but would not be probed by NAv-biotin adducts or IRR-N Western blotting. The red asterisk indicates the site of photo-cross-linking by PapB25 (10). (D) Further chymotryptic digestions of A8- and B25-cross-linked complexes yield similar 20 kDa glycosylated C-terminal fragments (lanes 2 and 5; including the mass of the insulin chain) that runs as 17 kDa on deglycosylation (lanes 3 and 6).

mentioned above, photo-cross-linking of PapB0 is markedly less efficient: relative to A8, B0-cross-linked complexes are reduced by >20-fold (lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16 in Figure 6). In each case, no covalent complex is observed in the absence of irradiation or in control studies of the PmpB25 precursor. To identify sites of cross-linking in the IR, we employed partial proteolysis with chymotrypsin to characterize fragments of the receptor R-subunit covalently bound to Papinsulin derivatives (Figure 7). Digestions were undertaken under native conditions, so fragments reflect accessible chymotryptic sites within and between structural modules of the receptor; approximate sites of preferential chymotryptic cleavage are indicated in Figure 7C (arrows; see Experimental Procedures). An initial screen exploited the prior characterization of an N-terminal 47 kDa chymotryptic glycosylated fragment of the R-subunit by Pilch and colleagues (49) and the availability of antiserum to an Nterminal epitope (designated IRR-N in the figures; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Data Sheet sc-710). Upon deglycosylation,

the apparent mass of this fragment on SDS-PAGE is 2930 kDa, so it contains 245-260 amino acids. Analysis of limited chymotryptic digests demonstrates that PapB16 contacts the N-terminal chymotryptic fragment (lanes 1-4 in panels A and B of Figure 7), in accord with its binding to the L1 -helix domain (47). As expected, PapB25 does not contact this N-terminal chymotryptic fragment but does contact a distinct 34 kDa fragment (lanes 5-8 in panels A and B of Figure 7), which therefore must contain the C-terminal region of the R-subunit derived from the insert domain (residues 704-718; 10). Remarkably, PapA8, although predicted to contact the L1 domain (11), cross-links to the same fragment as the B25 derivative and not to the N-terminal fragment (lanes 9-12 in panels A and B of Figure 7). On further chymotryptic digestion, the 34 kDa fragment is cleaved to 20 kDa (lanes 2 and 5 in Figure 7D), which on deglycosylation yields a 17 kDa adduct (lanes 3 and 6 in Figure 7D). The digestion patterns of the A8 and B25 crosslinked complexes are essentially identical (lanes 2 and 3 vs

A Novel Contact between Insulin and the Insulin Receptor lanes 5 and 6 in Figure 7D, respectively), indicating that both A8 and B25 contact the same C-terminal 14 kDa domain of the R-subunit. Weak cross-linking by the PapB0 derivative was not further characterized. DISCUSSION The IR is a receptor tyrosine kinase containing R- and -subunits (Figure 1B). Encoded by a single gene, the R-subunit binds insulin whereas the transmembrane -subunit contains a cytoplasmic kinase domain. Although the structure of the R2 2 holoreceptor is not known, important insights have been obtained by sequence analysis and homology modeling (27, 58). The R-subunit is a modular structure containing a series of distinct domains (L1, CR, L2, Fn0, and the N-terminal portion of Fn1/ID). Mutagenesis and domain "swap" studies suggest that the major insulin-binding regions are contained within the L1 -helix domain, first fibronectin homology domain (FnIII0), and C-terminal tail derived from the ID (59-61). Additional contacts with the central L2 domain and fibronectin homology regions have been suggested by cross-linking studies (10, 62). Specific binding to insulin is observed to a 70 kDa monomeric minimized receptor containing the tripartite L1-CR-L2 motif (CR, cysteine-rich domain) and Fn0 tethered to a C-terminal tail derived from the ID (61). A structural model of the holoreceptor-insulin complex has been proposed at atomic resolution based on low-resolution EM image reconstruction and computer-based docking (11-13). Although specific contacts are predicted (see below), the resolution of the EM data (20 Å) and the uncertain assumptions employed in the docking algorithm preclude its utility at present in the design of novel analogues. These images nonetheless suggest that the insulin molecule is engulfed within the larger ectodomain of the IR. The putative receptor-binding surface of insulin has been extensively investigated by mutagenesis and chemical modification (for review, see refs 2 and 27). Structure-function relationships have been delineated by alanine scanning mutagenesis (63) and extended by chemical synthesis of selected analogues refractory to biosynthetic expression (35, 64, 65). These studies yield a general trend: alanine substitutions that significantly impair activity occur at conserved sites, whereas well-tolerated substitutions occur at nonconserved sites. This and related studies suggest that the conserved surface of insulin is engaged at a well-packed hormone-receptor interface. Stringent steric requirements at opposing surfaces are indicated by severe decreases in affinity incurred following subtle changes in side chain shape or volume, such as IleA2 f Leu, ValA3 f Leu, ValB12 f Leu, and PheB25 f Leu (decreased by 22-, 555-, 33-, and 50-fold, respectively; 31, 64); this surface is proposed to include side chains (such as A2 and A3; shaded region in Figure 1A) that are largely inaccessible in the native state of the hormone (66). Given the evolutionary optimization of such close packing, can the potency of insulin be enhanced by protein engineering? Two "experiments of nature" led to characterization of substitutions that enhance the affinity of insulin for its receptor: ThrA8 f His and HisB10 f Asp. HisA8 was originally observed as a species variant among birds and fish (18-22, 25). Although these divergent insulins contain

Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 51, 2004 16129 multiple sequence differences, introduction of HisA8 into human insulin augments its activity by 2-5-fold (17, 22, 25). AspB10 was originally observed in a human pedigree in association with diabetes mellitus and hyperproinsulinemia (67). Although the mutation impairs the proper trafficking of the mutant proinsulin to the glucose-regulated secretory granule in the -cell (68), the corresponding substitution in human insulin enhances binding to the receptor by 2-fold (69). Remarkably, each of these substitutions enhances the thermodynamic stability of insulin (17), seemingly via analogous mechanisms. The ThrA8 f His substitution in principle improves the R-helical propensity and C-Cap potential of the A1-A8 R-helix, whereas AspB10 enhances the N-Cap potential of the B9-B19 R-helix. On the basis of these and related observations that certain low-affinity analogues exhibit reduced stability, Kaarsholm and colleagues proposed a correlation between stability and activity (17). These observations in turn suggested that thermodynamic optimization of the free hormone might provide a basis for designing analogues with enhanced activity (17). This possibility seemed to be attractive as the proposed strategy would circumvent the structural complexity of the receptor itself. Unfortunately, a recent study of multiple A8 analogues suggests that such a correlation is not generally observed and thus that explicit consideration of the IR will be necessary in understanding determinants of activity (22, 25). We envisage that the affinity of insulin may be enhanced by retaining the conserved framework of receptor contacts while optimizing nonconserved interactions at the edge of the hormone-receptor interface. This study was designed to test whether the enhanced activity of HisA8-insulin might reflect such a mechanism. Previous studies suggested that the A1-A8 R-helix functions as a preformed recognition element10 (54, 55). The diversity of side chains that are accommodated at A8 with little change in affinity suggests that this site, unlike conserved classical contacts at positions A2, A3, B12, B24, and B25, is not closely packed at the interface (25). In a pioneering model of a specific complex between insulin and the IR, Yip and colleagues interpreted EM images (70) to dock the T-state structure of insulin (crystallographic protomer 1BEN) within the interior of the ectodomain (11). In this model, ThrA8 and TyrB16 are proposed to contact dimer-related L1 domains in the R2 2 heterotetramer. The side chain of the ThrA8 is near Arg86 on the flat surface the L1 domain (predicted inter-side chain distance of 2.6 Å; 13). The enhanced affinity of HisA8-insulin was ascribed to a stabilizing contact between its imidazole ring and the side chain Asp59 of the L1 domain (11). Such
10 That the A1-A8 R-helix functions as a preformed recognition element is suggested by the study of a two-disulfide analogue in which internal cystine A6-A11 is pairwise substituted with either serine or alanine (4, 54, 90). The analogues are essentially identical in structure and stability: each exhibits segmental unfolding of the A1-A8 R-helix in an otherwise native-like subdomain. Restoration of this helix after receptor binding is implied by relative activities: the alanine analogue is 30-fold more active than the serine analogue, in quantitative accord with empirical tables of helical propensities and solvent transfer hydrophobic free energies (54). Substitution of ValA3 with Pap results in a low-affinity analogue (relative activity of 1%) that cross-links with high efficiency to the insulin receptor. Interpretation of this result in relation to native hormone-receptor recognition is unclear as CD spectra of the analogue indicate a decreased R-helix content and so possible perturbation of the A1-A8 R-helix, including the photoactive probe (unpublished results).

16130 Biochemistry, Vol. 43, No. 51, 2004 a charge-stabilized hydrogen bond between HisA8 and the L1 -helix would be reminiscent of the A4-A8 contact observed here in the T-state protomer of the crystallographic hexamer. The model also predicts that TyrB16 contacts a similar region of the L1 domain (residue L87) in the other R-subunit (11). Our study provides an experimental test of aspects of the Yip model. Although TyrB16 indeed contacts the L1 domain (47), PapA8 cross-links instead to a 14 kDa C-terminal domain derived from the FnI/ID region. Contacts with this domain are not visualized in the Yip model. Although the structure of the ID is enigmatic, a model of FnI has been proposed on the basis of crystal structures of the fibronectin (FN) type III domain (71-73). Such domains, 90 residues in length, consist of upper and lower antiparallel -sheets (containing four and three -strands, respectively). All seven strands are connected by loops of variable length (72). Whereas the Fn0 and Fn1 domains of the IR may be deleted in monomeric minimized receptor constructs, the ID-derived tail of the R-subunit (residues 704-719) is critical to receptor binding (61, 74). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the tail of the secreted ectodomain (residues 704-716) demonstrated that 10 of these 14 residues contributed to insulin binding; severe impairment (>1000-fold decreases in affinity) was observed following substitutions at four sites. It would be of future interest to determine if PapA8 (like PapB25) contacts this critical region or instead introduces a novel contact peripheral to the major hormone-binding site in the ID. The diversity of amino acids that are functionally well tolerated at A8 (25) favors the latter possibility. The discrepancy between these A8 cross-linking results and the Yip model (11) does not necessarily require a major reassessment of domain assignments in the EM image reconstruction (12) as a variety of types of evidence suggests three-dimensional contiguity between the N- and C-terminal domains of the R-subunit (61, 75, 76). Of particular interest are studies of a truncated high-affinity analogue (designated X92; 77). This analogue lacks the five C-terminal residues of the B chain (B26-B30; 43). Comparison of intact insulin and X92 enabled the role of the C-terminal segment of the B chain to be probed in the hormone-receptor complex (77). Two key substitutions in the IR were observed by Whittaker and colleagues to impair binding of insulin more significantly than binding of X92. Remarkably, one of the alanine substitutions is in the amino-terminal L1 domain (R14A), whereas the other is in the C-terminal tail derived from the ID (H710A). Control studies demonstrated that such differential binding was due to C-terminal truncation of the B chain and not to substitutions elsewhere in the protein (77). Whittaker and colleagues thus proposed that the N- and C-terminal domains of the receptor each contact the Cterminal region of the B chain, and hence must themselves be close together (77). It is therefore possible that only small adjustments in the EM-derived model might be necessary to accommodate our findings. An intriguing hypothesis envisages that a single insulin molecule employs major and minor receptor-binding surfaces to bind two R-subunits simultaneously (43, 78). Such an "internal dimer" would mimic the explicit hormone-induced dimerization of receptors for a number of hematopoietic hormone and cytokines (such as growth hormone, prolactin, and tumor necrosis factor; 79-83). It is possible that the IR

Wan et al. activation mechanism resembles the erythropoietin signaling system in which binding of a bivalent ligand to a preformed dimer leads to nonlocal structural rearrangement of the receptor with approximation of the two subunits (84). It is possible that insulin-induced changes in the relative orientation of R-subunits also reposition the -subunits, leading to activation of their TK activity (78). In light of these hypotheses, it is possible that PapA8 and PapB25, although each efficient in cross-linking to the C-terminal domain of the R-subunit, are in fact binding to different R-subunits. CONCLUDING REMARKS To our knowledge, this study provides the first explicit evidence that R-helices in both the A and B chains contact the IR. Mapping of A8 cross-linking to the C-terminal FnI/ ID domain, although consistent with the critical importance of the ID-derived tail in hormone binding (10, 61, 77), is not in accord with a high-resolution model of the insulinIR complex (11). This discrepancy may reflect the possibility that insulin docks in an orientation different from that proposed in the model (requiring global adjustment of the model), that the hormone undergoes a change in conformation on binding to the IR (confounding an assumption of the model), and/or that HisA8 alters the overall mode of binding of insulin (relative to native human insulin). We favor the hypothesis that insulin undergoes a change in conformation on binding, so models based on docking of crystallographic protomers are likely to be misleading. In the future, such model building procedures could be refined on the basis of biochemical characterization of multiple Pap analogues with precise mapping of contact points by mass spectrometry. A definitive picture of the hormone-receptor complex awaits crystallographic analysis. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank D. F. Steiner for the P3-A cell line overexpressing the IR, G. D. Smith and C. C.
