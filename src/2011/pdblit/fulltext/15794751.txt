The X-ray structure of the ionotropic GluR2 ligand-binding core (GluR2S1S2J) in complex with the bicyclical AMPA analogue (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid [(S)-4-AHCP] has been determined, as well as the binding pharmacology of this construct and of the full-length GluR2 receptor. (S)-4-AHCP binds with a glutamatelike binding mode and the ligand adopts two different conformations. The Ki of (S)-4-AHCP at GluR2-S1S2J was determined to be 185 ± 29 nm and at full-length GluR2(R)o it was 175 ± 8 nm. (S)-4-AHCP appears to elicit partial agonism at GluR2 by inducing an intermediate degree of domain closure (17°). Also, functionally (S)-4-AHCP has an efficacy of 0.38 at GluR2(Q)i, relative to (S)-glutamate. The proximity of bound (S)-4-AHCP to domain D2 prevents full D1­D2 domain closure, which is limited by steric repulsion, especially between Leu704 and the ligand.

The main excitatory amino acid in the central nervous system (S)-glutamate, exerts its actions by binding to three different classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) and three classes of metabotropic receptors, which all have important functions in neuronal signalling (for a review, see [1]). With the glutamatergic system implicated in a variety of brain disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, these receptors are potential targets for pharmacotherapy [2,3]. The iGluRs form ligand-gated ion channels and have been classified according to their agonist selectivity as 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA), kainic acid (KA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors [3]. Four subunits, assem-

bled as a pair of dimers, constitute the receptor ion-channel complex [4­11]. Among iGluR subunits, homomeric and heteromeric receptors constructed from cloned GluR1­4 are most sensitive to activation by AMPA, and thus native AMPA receptors are identified with these genes [12­14]. The subunits exist in two different alternatively spliced isoforms, flip (i) and flop (o), which have different desensitization properties. In addition, two RNA-edited isoforms of GluR2 are found in which a crucial amino-acid residue in the channel pore region is either glutamine or arginine (the Q / R site) and this affects channel properties, e.g. rectification and ion-selectivity of GluR2-containing heteromeric channels [2].

GluR2 ligand-binding core in complex with (S)-4-AHCP

B. B. Nielsen et al.

Overexpression and purification of a GluR2 construct (GluR2-S1S2J) containing the extracellular segments S1 and S2 linked by a small peptide has provided a soluble form of the ligand-binding core of the GluR2 receptor, belonging to the AMPA class of iGluRs [15]. Binding of agonists to this construct creates a pharmacological profile comparable to that seen for the full-length receptor [16,17]. A number of structures of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with different agonists (e.g. [15,18­22]) and antagonists [15,23] have provided evidence that competitive ligands bind in a cleft between two domains, D1 and D2. Domain movement occurs upon ligand binding, resulting in closure of the binding cleft. The extent of domain closure is correlated with activation and desensitization of the receptor (for a review, see [24]). The AMPA receptor agonist, 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (4-AHCP) was originally synthesized as a conformationally restricted analogue of AMPA [25]. As is often the case, the agonist activity resides with one enantiomer (S)-4-AHCP. The agonist shows activity at AMPA receptors, but it is 35­115 times more potent at GluR5 homomers, classified as low affinity KA receptors [26]. (S)-4-AHCP distinguishes itself from the majority of iGluR agonists by its bicyclical structure, and the extra carbon atom between the a-amino acid moiety and the distal isoxazole 3-hydroxy anion (Fig. 1). The seven-membered ring offers opportunities for design and stereospecific derivatization in directions not easily accessible from other scaffolds. Accurate knowledge of the binding mode of (S)-4-AHCP

may assist in the structure-based design of ligands that are targeted to iGluR specific subtypes, as well as highlighting regions that could be occupied by small hydrophobic substituents to increase affinity. Here, we present the first structure of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with the bicyclical AMPA analogue (S)-4-AHCP, as well as the pharmacology of (S)-4-AHCP binding to GluR2-S1S2J and full-length GluR2 receptors.

Results and Discussion
Pharmacology of (S)-4-AHCP The affinity of (S)-4-AHCP for GluR2-S1S2J was determined to be (mean ± SEM): Ki ¼ 185 ± 29 nm; Hill coefficient (nH) ¼ 1.03 ± 0.04 (n ¼ 4) and for fulllength GluR2(R)o: Ki ¼ 175 ± 8 nm; nH ¼ 0.95 ± 0.02 (n ¼ 3) (Fig. 2A). No statistically significant difference between the Ki values was observed using the t-test (P ¼ 0.80). The affinity for the construct GluR2-S1S2J is identical to the affinity for the full-length receptor, implying that the binding of (S)-4-AHCP observed in the crystal structure represents the binding mode at the full-length receptor. Analysis of concentration­response curves for (S)-4-AHCP activation of GluR2(Q)i expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes gave: concentration of drug producing 50% of the maximal response (EC50) ¼ 17.5 ± 1.2 lm, nH ¼ 0.95 ± 0.04 (n ¼ 7) and an efficacy of 0.381 ± 0.046 (n ¼ 7), relative to (S)-glutamate (Fig. 2B). Similar EC50 values have been reported for (S)-4-AHCP at the other AMPA receptors: GluR1o (4.5 lm), GluR3o (7.2 lm) and GluR4o (15 lm) [26]. Interactions of (S)-4-AHCP with GluR2 The GluR2-S1S2J:(S)-4-AHCP complex crystallizes with one molecule in the asymmetric unit of the crystal ° and the structure has been determined at 1.75 A resolution (Table 1). (S)-4-AHCP was modelled in two different conformations in the ligand-binding site; the major variation is two conformationally enantiomeric puckering modes of the seven-membered ring of the ligand but the orientation of the ligand in the two conformations is also slightly different (Fig. 3). However, the positions of the atoms of the 3-isoxazolol moiety ° only differ between 0.2 and 0.4 A, which may be within the experimental error. The interactions of the a-amino acid moiety of both conformations of the ligand with binding site residues are tabulated in Table 2. Multiple ligand conformations, implying some retention of conformational entropy upon binding, have not previously been observed at GluR2. The barrier to ring inversion in (S)-4-AHCP is lower than the barrier to

binding and receptor activation, hence, ring inversion occurs on a much more rapid timescale than binding and activation. Significant flexibility in the protein is not seen in response to the two conformations and both are substantially populated, which suggests that they are similar in internal energy, in interaction energy and in binding energy. We expect that the ligand can rearrange while bound, at least at the temperature at which affinity is measured. Thus, the observed affinity will be a Boltzmann average of the two states in rapid equilibrium. The interactions of the a-amino acid moiety of the ligand with binding site residues (Table 2) are conFEBS Journal 272 (2005) 1639­1648 ª 2005 FEBS

served compared to other GluR2-agonist complexes [15,18­21]. Besides the residues forming ion pairs or hydrogen bonds with the ligand, a number of additional residues are involved in hydrophobic or van der Waals' interactions (Table 2). Practically all the same residues have been shown to be in van der Waals' contact in other agonist complexes (e.g. [20]). The ligand is `squeezed in' between Tyr450 and Leu650 on the one side and Glu705 and Tyr732 on the opposite side, forming a hydrophobic sandwich (Fig. 3B and C). The Tyr450 side chain interacts extensively with the a-amino acid group, as well as with C4, C5, C6 and C7 of the seven-membered ring. Leu650 interacts with the isoxazole, C4, C5, C6 and C9. The residues Glu402 and Thr686, which form an interdomain hydrogen-bond lock upon agonist binding, also interact with atoms of the seven-membered ring. Leu704 forms contacts to C3, N1 and O1 of the isoxazole ring and C8 of the seven-membered ring, while the residue

Met708 follows the contour of the seven-membered ring, interacting hydrophobically with C6, C7 and C8. (S)-4-AHCP may be classified as a barely exposed ligand, as only a small part of the bicyclical ring system can be seen from the exterior of the protein. The conformation of the peptide bond Asp651­ Ser652, which has been shown to be flipped 180° in the complexes with most full agonists [15,18,19], is similar to the nonflipped conformation observed in, for example, the apo and (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid [(S)-Br-HIBO] complex. The backbone oxygen atom of Ser652 is connected to the 3-hydroxy anion (O2) of (S)-4-AHCP through the water molecule W1. Comparison with other isoxazole-based agonists The binding modes of GluR2 agonists thus far characterized can be broadly divided into two classes, the glutamate mode and the AMPA mode. In the glutamate binding mode, the agonist approaches D2 more closely and interacts directly with the hydrogen-bond
1642

donor atoms of Ser654 and Thr655. In the AMPA binding mode, the interaction with D2 is mediated via a water molecule (here denoted W4) [15,18,19]. To characterize the binding mode of (S)-4-AHCP, the structure was compared to those of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with (S)-glutamate (S)-AMPA and (S)-2amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-methyl-2H-5-tetrazolyl)-4-isoxazolyl]propionic acid [(S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA]. The binding mode of (S)-4-AHCP falls between those of (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA and (S)-AMPA with regard to the position of the isoxazole ring (Fig. 4A). As both (S)-4-AHCP and (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA bind with the distal anionic moiety interacting directly with the backbone N atom of Thr655, the binding mode resembles most closely that of (S)-glutamate. The 3-hydroxy anion of (S)-4-AHCP is also hydrogen bonded to W1, as seen for (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA and (S)-glutamate, but no water molecule is observed corresponding to W4 in the (S)-AMPA complex. The glutamate binding mode of (S)-4-AHCP would be expected from the size of the 5-substituent of the isoxazole ring (the fused seven-membered ring) since the limited hydrophobic

(S)-glutamate (v1 ¼ 179°; v2 ¼ 65°; mol C) (S)-2-MeTet-AMPA (v1 ¼ 172°; v2 ¼ 68°; mol B) and (S)AMPA (v1 ¼ 179°; v2 ¼ 67°; mol C) complexes and adopts a conformation more like the one seen in the GluR2-S1S2J:kainate complex (v1 ¼ )94°; v2 ¼ 166°). Leu650 apparently adjusts its conformation for optimal hydrophobic contact with (S)-4-AHCP. The side chain of Met708 lends flexibility to the binding pocket; its conformation adjusting to fit various ligands [15,18­20]. In the (S)-4-AHCP complex, the tail of this side chain skirts the binding pocket to avoid clashing with the ligand. The Ce atom of Met708 points back into favourable van der Waals' contact with the sevenmembered ring of (S)-4-AHCP. (S)-4-AHCP is a partial agonist at GluR2 The D1­D2 domain closure in the GluR2-S1S2J:(S)-4AHCP structure is 16.9° (relative to the structure of apo GluR2-S1S2J), which is less than the domain closure for full agonists ( 21°). The apparent explanation for this is twofold. Firstly (S)-4-AHCP has an extra carbon atom between the a-amino acid and the distal anionic moieties compared with other 3-hydroxy isoxazole analogues. Although conformational restriction shortens the distance between the a-amino acid group and the distal 3-hydroxy anion, the isoxazole is nonetheless pushed deeper into D2 than in the other three [(S)-glutamate (S)-AMPA and (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA] structures when adopting the conformation required for recognition of a-amino acids. This favours intermediate domain closure. Secondly, driving the domains closer to each other would result in steric clashes between the bicyclical ring system of (S)-4-AHCP and the backbone atoms of Leu704. Also, the side chains of Tyr450, Thr655, Glu705 and Met708 would need to rearrange. In the present structure, the Ca atom of Leu704 is ° displaced 0.9 A (Fig. 4B) compared to its position in GluR2-S1S2J:(S)-glutamate. One consequence of the position of the isoxazole ring close to D2 is the hydrogen bond formed between the isoxazole oxygen atom and the backbone nitrogen atom of Glu705 (Fig. 3C). This is different from other known structures of GluR2 in complex with isoxazole-based agonists. The GluR2-S1S2J:(S)-4-AHCP complex forms a dimer in the crystal as observed in all other agonist complexes reported. The dimer is generated by applying crystallographic symmetry to the monomer that is observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The distance between the GT-linker (replacing the M1 and M2 transmembrane regions) of both protomers has been shown to be linearly related to the degree of domain closure [15,18,21]. In this structure, the

space available in the pocket (formed mostly by D1) forces larger ligands closer to D2. The seven-membered ring of (S)-4-AHCP fills out some of the same space as the 2-methyl-tetrazole ring of (S)-2-Me-Tet-AMPA, but does not protrude as deeply into the pocket. However, unlike the tetrazole ring, the seven-membered ring is not planar and it occupies additional space towards the residues Glu402 from D1 and Thr686 from D2, constituting the lock between the two domains of the agonist-bound GluR2 ligandbinding core. Atoms C5, C6 and C7 in particular approach the lock, but without major disturbance. This interdomain interaction is still intact in the sense that a hydrogen bond is formed between the two resi° dues, however, the distance is somewhat longer (3.1 A) ° than in the other three complexes ( 2.7 A). The residues Leu650 and Met708 that are involved in hydrophobic interactions with the ligands show conformational variability in the structures under discussion. The side chain of Leu650 is flipped  180° in (S)-4-AHCP (v1 ¼ )87°; v2 ¼ )167°) relative to the

° distance is 34.1 A (between Ile633-Ile633 Ca-atoms). It has been suggested previously that the movement of D2 to close over the ligand causes conformational strain that is transferred to the ion channel, leading to pore opening [27]. (S)-4-AHCP has an efficacy of 0.38 at GluR2(Q)i relative to (S)-glutamate. The efficacy combined with the observed domain closure (16.9°) and D2­D2 linker separation imply that (S)-4-AHCP acts as a partial agonist at the AMPA-type receptor GluR2. Based on comparisons with structural and pharmacological studies on a range of other agonists [15,18,21], partial agonism was indeed expected from the observed degree of GluR2-S1S2J domain closure and D2­D2 linker separation. (S)-4-AHCP and receptor subtype selectivity (S)-4-AHCP displays selectivity for homomers of the low affinity kainate receptor subunit GluR5 over the
1644

AMPA receptors [26]. The most important differences in the ligand-binding site between GluR2 and GluR5 are the respective substitutions of Leu650 and Met708 in GluR2 to the smaller residues Val685 and Ser741 in GluR5 (numbering as in TrEMBL entry Q86SU9). In particular, mutagenesis studies have shown that the latter residue is responsible for the selectivity displayed by another GluR5 subtype selective agonist (S)2-amino-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid [28]. Recently, Armstrong et al. [29] reported that the mutation of Leu650 to Thr in GluR2 yields a receptor that responds more potently and efficaciously to the partial agonist kainate and less to the full agonist AMPA compared to unmodified GluR2. Also, the nonconserved residue at position 702 in GluR2 has been identified as the major contributor to the selectivity of (S)-Br-HIBO for GluR1 (Tyr698) over GluR3 (Phe706) [30]. In GluR5, this residue is Leu735 and it may thus play a role in receptor selectivity. Thr686

forms an interdomain interaction with Glu402, and is in close contact with atoms of the seven-membered ring system; this residue is replaced by the smaller Ser721 in GluR5. Homology modelling of the ligand-binding core of GluR5 and docking of (S)-4-AHCP to this model has shown that the binding site is larger than in GluR2; thus allowing the accommodation of larger and more bulky ligands [26]. A corresponding analysis based on the structure of GluR2-S1S2J in complex with (S)-4AHCP supports this finding. Using single-channel recordings, domain closure has elegantly been shown to correlate with the open probability of discrete subconductance states of the channel and also with receptor desensitization [21]. Taken together, the smaller residues in GluR5 would probably allow for increased domain closure compared to that of GluR2, as well as a more complementary van der Waals' environment, and this may explain the functional selectivity of (S)-4-AHCP towards GluR5. A fuller understanding of GluR5 selectivity awaits the publication of the structure of a GluR5 construct in complex with an agonist.

Receptor binding assay
(S)-4-AHCP binding affinity at the GluR2-S1S2J soluble construct and at full-length GluR2(R)o was determined by a radioligand binding assay. Purified construct (0.1 lg protein) or Sf9 insect cell membranes (0.2­0.4 mg protein) expressing GluR2(R)o [33] were incubated with 2­4 nm (RS)[5-methyl-3H]-AMPA (43.5 CiÆmmol)1; Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA) in the presence of 1 nm)0.10 mm (S)-4AHCP for 1­2 h on ice in assay buffer (50 mm Tris / HCl, 100 mm KSCN, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2 at 4 °C; containing 10% glycerol for GluR2-S1S2J). Samples were filtered onto Millipore 0.22-lm GSWP nitrocellulose filters (for GluR2S1S2J) or Whatman GF / B filters [for GluR2(R)o]. Filters were washed twice with cold assay buffer and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Data were analysed using grafit v3.00 (Erithacus Software Ltd, Horley, UK) and fit as previously described [34] to determine Hill coefficient and Ki. The Kd values of [3H]AMPA at GluR2-S1S2J (12.8 nm) and GluR2(R)o (16.8 nm) were determined previously [18,33].

Oocytes were typically used for recordings from 3 to 10 days postinjection and were voltage-clamped with the use of a two-electrode voltage clamp (GeneClamp 500B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA) with both microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl. Recordings were made while the oocytes were continuously superfused with nominally Ca2+-free frog Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm BaCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0). Drugs were dissolved in Ca2+-free frog Ringer's solution and added by bath application. Recordings were made at room temperature at holding potentials in the range of )80 to )20 mV. For efficacy measurements, (S)-4-AHCP was applied at a saturating concentration (500 lm) in the presence of 100 lm cyclothiazide in order to block receptor desensitization (cyclothiazide EC50: GluR2(Q)i ¼ 7.6 lm [35]). Control

Experimental procedures
Materials
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Vallensbæk Strand, Denmark) unless otherwise specified. The synthesis of (S)-4-AHCP is as described by Brehm et al. [26]. Restriction and other molecular biological enzymes were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverley, MA, USA).

Protein expression and purification
The GluR2-S1S2J construct described by Armstrong and Gouaux [15] was expressed, refolded and purified essentially as previously reported [17,31]. The rat AMPA receptor clone GluR2(Q)i within the vector pGEMHE [32] was used for preparation of high-expression cRNA transcripts. cDNA were grown in XL1 Blue bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and prepared using column purification (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cRNA was synthesized from this cDNA using the mMessage mMachine T7 mRNA-capping transcription kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX, USA).

Cell culture
Sf9 insect cells were maintained in BaculoGold Max-XP serum-free medium (BD Biosciences, FranklinLakes, NJ, USA) according to standard manufacturers protocols.

stimulations with 1 mm (S)-glutamate plus 100 lm cyclothiazide were performed immediately prior to, and after (S)-4AHCP application, with a washout period of 5­10 min between drug applications. The two control (S)-glutamate stimulations were each no more than 1­9% different from the mean value. Cyclothiazide (100 lm) was preapplied alone for 1 min before each agonist application. The (S)-4AHCP maximum response was then expressed as a fraction of the mean value of the two test (S)-glutamate stimulations.

Data analysis of pharmacology
Student's t-test was used for comparison of Ki values using sigmastat for Windows v3.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Values are given as mean ± SEM and were considered statistically significantly different if P < 0.05. Concentration­response curves for agonists were analysed using grafit v3.00 to determine the EC50 and Hill value (nH), using Eqn (1), where I is the measured current and Imax is the maximal steady-state current.

Co-crystallization of GluR2-S1S2J with (S)-4-AHCP
The GluR2-S1S2J protein was dialysed extensively in the buffer used for crystallization (10 mm Hepes pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) and concentrated to 6 mgÆmL)1. The GluR2-S1S2J was mixed with (S)-4-AHCP at a ratio of 1 : 49. Crystals were obtained at 6 °C by the hanging drop vapour diffusion method using a reservoir solution containing 0.2 m lithium sulfate, 0.1 m phosphate­citrate buffer pH 4.5 and 20% PEG 3350. Crystals were transferred through a cryo-protectant solution consisting of 4.7 mm ligand and 12% glycerol in reservoir solution prior to flash-cooling.

X-ray data collection
The X-ray diffraction data were collected from one crystal ° at 100 K and at a wavelength of 0.811 A using a MAR CCD detector at beamline X11 (DESY, Hamburg, Ger° many). The crystal diffracted to 1.75 A. The HKL package (Denzo and Scalepack) [36] was used for autoindexing and data processing, for statistics see Table 1.

translation function was obtained. The program arp / warp [39] was used for tracing the majority of the structure. Refinements alternating with manual model building were performed using the programs refmac5 [40] and o [41], respectively. The electron density corresponding to (S)-4-AHCP was well defined and allowed unambiguous positioning of two different conformations of the ligand (refined with equal occupancy; see Fig. 3A). Initially (S)-4-AHCP was modelled as a single conformation; however, additional Fo­Fc difference electron density was present, indicating conformationally enantiomeric puckering of the seven-membered ring of the ligand. The atoms of the seven-membered ring were built and refined in two conformations but additional density still appeared. Therefore, two conformations (including all ligand atoms) were modelled and all atoms refined with half occupancy. This resulted in the disappearance of the additional difference electron density. A monomer library description of the ligand for REFMAC5 has been created. (S)-4-AHCP was built as the triion and submitted to conformational analysis using the MMFFs force field with GB-SA treatment of solvation in macromodel 8.1 [42]. Three distinct low energy conformers were chosen to represent the repertoire of the ring and truncated systems were built (conformers of 4-ethyl-7,8dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-3-ol anion). These were minimized using Density Functional Theory [B3LYP / 6­ 311 + G(d,p)] in gaussian¢03 [43] to give highly accurate co-ordinates for the ring system. The amino-acid group was rebuilt from the ethyl side chain and the resulting glycine moiety was re-minimized with MMFFs / GB-SA with the other atoms frozen in the positions determined by quantum chemistry. The coordinates of one of the low energy conformations of (S)-4-AHCP were used for the library description. Water molecules as well as two sulfate ions and three glycerol molecules were included as refinement progressed. The refined structure comprises (using the numbering of full-length membrane bound receptor without signal peptide, Swiss-Prot entry P19491) residues 392­506, the GT linker and residues 632­774, as well as two additional N-terminal residues. For refinement statistics (Table 1). The coordinates of the GluR2-S1S2J structure in complex with (S)-4-AHCP have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank with accession code 1WVJ.

Structure analysis and figure preparation
The hingefind script [44] implemented in the program vmd [45] was used to calculate the ligand-induced domain closure relative to the apoGluR2-S1S2J structure (pdb code 1FTO, mol A). The CCP4 program contacts was used in the analysis of protein­ligand interactions. The programs molscript [46], raster3d [47] and bobscript [48] were used in the preparation of figures.

Structure determination and refinement
The structure was solved using molecular replacement with amore [37] implemented in the ccp4i package [38]. The protein atoms of the structure of GluR2-S1S2J complexed with (S)-Br-HIBO ([18]; pdb code 1M5C), was used as a search model. Only one solution to both the rotation- and
