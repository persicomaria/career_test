ABSTRACT The interactions of nitric oxide (NO) and organic nitroso compounds with heme proteins are biologically important, and adduct formation between NO-containing compounds and myoglobin (Mb) have served as prototypical systems for studies of these interactions. We have prepared crystals of horse heart (hh) MbNO from nitrosylation of aqua-metMb crystals, and we have determined the crystal structure of hh MbNO at a resolution of 1.9 Å. The Fe-N-O angle of 147° in hh MbNO is larger than the corresponding 112° angle previously determined from the crystal structure of sperm whale MbNO (Brucker et al., Proteins 1998;30:352­ 356) but is similar to the 150° angle determined from a MS XAFS study of a frozen solution of hh MbNO (Rich et al., J Am Chem Soc 1998;120:10827­10836). The Fe-N(O) bond length of 2.0 Å (this work) is longer than the 1.75 Å distance determined from the XAFS study and suggests distal pocket influences on FeNO geometry. The nitrosyl N atom is located 3.0 Å from the imidazole N atom of the distal His64 residue, suggesting electrostatic stabilization of the FeNO moiety by His64. The crystal structure of the nitrosoethane adduct of ferrous hh Mb was determined at a resolution of 1.7 Å. The nitroso O atom of the EtNO ligand is located 2.7 Å from the imidazole N atom of His64, suggesting a hydrogen bond interaction between these groups. To the best of our knowledge, the crystal structure of hh Mb(EtNO) is the first such determination of a nitrosoalkane adduct of a heme protein. Proteins 2003;53:182­192.

Key words: myoglobin; heme; nitric oxide; nitrosyl; nitrosoalkane; X-ray INTRODUCTION Nitric oxide (NO) is biosynthesized from L-arginine by the heme-containing enzyme NO synthase. This enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of L-arginine to citrulline and NO in two general steps using NADPH and O2 as additional substrates.1 The first step involves the conversion of L-arginine to N -hydroxy-L-arginine, and the second step completes the oxidation to give citrulline and NO as final products. The identity of NO as the final gaseous product is generally accepted; however, some intriguing results that suggest that HNO (nitroxyl) is the initial product of this conversion have been presented in the literature (reviewed in Ref. 1).

The interactions of NO and organic nitroso compounds, of the general form X-NAO, with the metal centers in heme-containing biomolecules are biologically important.2,3 A primary role for NO in vivo is as a signaling molecule. The heme-containing receptor, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), contains histidine as a heme ligand, and the heme iron binds NO in a process that has been correlated with sGC activation and subsequent vasodilation.4,5 NO is known to bind to other heme-containing biomolecules such as myoglobin (Mb), hemoglobin (Hb), cytochrome P450 and NO synthase, and the binding and activation of NO by metalloporphyrins and heme have been reviewed recently.2 The prototypical system used for the study of Fe-NO bond formation and reactivity in histidine-liganded heme centers is nitrosyl myoglobin (MbNO).2,6 ­ 8 This is due, in part, to the fact that some myoglobins, such as horse heart Mb (hh Mb) and recombinant sperm whale Mb (sw Mb), are commercially available and are readily purified. In addition to the study of its formation in meatcuring processes,6,9 MbNO has been studied with regard to the kinetics of NO binding to the ferrous (kon/koff 1.4 1011 M 1) and ferric heme (kon/koff 1.4 104 M 1),10 photodissociation and geminate recombination of NO,11­13 and NO dioxygenase and scavenging potential.14 Valuable insights into the FeNO angle in MbNO have been provided by spectroscopy. Dickinson and Chien15 analyzed the low-temperature EPR spectra of sw MbNO. They determined that at 77 K the Fe-N-O angle in sw MbNO was 108 ­110°, similar to the 110° value previously determined by Chien for single crystals of equine HbNO at 77 K.16 Hori et al.17 examined the EPR spectra of single crystals of sw MbNO at ambient and cryogenic temperatures and determined that the Fe-N-O angle was 153 5° at 293 K and 109 5° at 77 K. The effect of temperature on the EPR spectra of nitrosyl hemes was examined in a computational study by Waleh et al.,18 who suggested that changes in ligand geometry in MbNO could explain the EPR spectral results. Rich et al.19 used multiple-scattering XAFS to determine an Fe-N-O angle of 150° for a frozen solution of ferrous hh MbNO at 10 K. It is surprising

that although many studies of MbNO have employed the commercially available hh Mb, crystal structural data on a nitrosyl derivative of a native Mb have only been reported for ferrous sw MbNO, and this compound exhibited an Fe-N-O angle of 112°.20 Nitrosoalkanes and nitrosoarenes (R-NAO; R alkyl or aryl group) are biologically important compounds that are generated in physiological media by oxidative metabolism of the precursor amines RNH2 (or hydroxylamines RNHOH) or by reduction of the organic nitro RNO2 compounds, and these resulting RNO compounds are known to interact with several heme-containing biomolecules by binding to the heme iron.3,21­32 In heme proteins that contain exposed cysteine residues (e.g., hemoglobin), interactions of RNO compounds with the Cys residues are possible.33,34 RNO binding to histidine-liganded hemes are biologically relevant. For example, Hb(RNO) formation was shown to be associated with nitrobenzene poisoning more than a century ago.35,36 We previously demonstrated, by single-crystal X-ray crystallography, that in heme model complexes containing RNO ligands, the ligands can bind to the iron center through either the N or O atoms.37 Two other reports have been published that show N-binding of RNO ligands to the iron center in heme model complexes.38,39 However, it is surprising that there is very little information to date on the structural consequences of RNO binding to the iron center in heme proteins. Thus, despite the importance of RNO binding to heme proteins (e.g., in the inhibition of heme protein function),3 there are no reports to date of the single-crystal X-ray structural characterization of a heme-nitrosoalkane adduct. There is only one structural example of a related heme-nitrosoarene complex: the nitrosobenzene adduct of leghemoglobin from Lupinus luteus.40 In this article, we report the crystallization and singlecrystal X-ray structural characterization of the nitrosyl and nitrosoethane adducts of horse heart Mb. MATERIALS AND METHODS Horse heart myoglobin (hh Mb) was obtained from Sigma. Nitroethane (EtNO2, 99.5%) and sodium dithionite (85%) were purchased from Aldrich. Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl, molecular biology grade, 99.0%) and ammonium sulfate ( 99.5%) were obtained from Fluka. Sodium nitrite (98.0%) was obtained from Baker and Adamson. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard model 8453 diode array instrument. Crystallization Nitrosyl myoglobin (MbNO) Ferric aqua-metMb crystals were grown according to the method of Schlichting et al.41 The crystals were grown anaerobically in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature (21°C) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals grew in clusters of plates and reached a suitable size (0.5 0.2 0.05 mm) in 5 days. The droplet containing the crystal clusters was transferred to 0.5 mL of artificial mother liquor containing 7.5% glycerol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant. Sodium nitrite

crystals ( 5 mg) and sodium dithionite ( 10 mg) were added to this solution. During the ensuing 15-min period, the color of the crystal clusters changed from orangebrown to red. Single plates were then harvested anaerobically and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. UV-vis spectroscopic measurements on crystal clusters prepared and manipulated in this way revealed complete conversion of aqua-metMb to MbNO ( max 420 nm).42 Ferrous nitrosoethane myoglobin [Mb(EtNO)] A 30 mg/mL solution of hh Mb was prepared in 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. An excess of nitroethane (10 L) and sodium dithionite (50 mg) were added to the solution, and an immediate color change of the solution from brown to reddish-purple occurred, indicative of the formation of the desired Mb(EtNO) product ( max 425 nm).32 The solution was then applied to a desalting column (Sephadex G25, 10 mL), and the flow-through sample was reconcentrated to 30 mg/mL by using a Centricon YM-10 membrane. Crystals were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature (21°C). The droplets were 10 L each in volume and were prepared by mixing 5 L of the 30 mg/mL protein solution in 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 with 5 L of 3.4 ­ 4.0 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. The droplets were suspended over reservoirs containing 1 mL of 3.1­3.3 M ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. Crystals of suitable size (1.0 0.4 0.05 mm) grew in 5 days. These were harvested and passed through a solution of the artificial mother liquor containing 7.5% glycerol (v/v) as a cryoprotectant. The crystals were then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data Collection X-ray data were collected at 100 K by using CuK radiation produced from a RigakuMSC RU-H3R X-ray generator operated at 50 kV/100 mA and an R-AXIS IV image plate detector. For the MbNO crystal, the crystal-todetector distance was set at 70 mm, and 180 frames of data were collected by using a 1.0° oscillation to a resolution of 1.9 Å. For the Mb(EtNO) crystal, the crystal-to-detector distance was set at 100 mm, and 148 frames were collected by using a 1.0° oscillation to a resolution of 1.7 Å. All data were processed with the d*TREK program as contained in the Crystal Clear suite available from Molecular Structure Corporation.43 Structure Solution and Refinement Molecular replacement, as implemented in the CNS suite,44 was used for structure solution for both the MbNO and Mb(EtNO) structures. The search model chosen for both structures was that of the 1.45 Å resolution structure of ferrous MbCO (PDB access code 1DWR)41 with the solvent molecules and carbon monoxide ligand omitted from the structure. MbNO After the rotation and translation search, the initial model had an R-factor of 36.04%. Rigid body refinement and bulk solvent correction were then performed, and

184

these lowered the R-factor to 28.86%. Density for the nitrosyl ligand was apparent in the first Fo-Fc electron density map. The NO ligand was modeled into this density, and its position was unrestrained throughout refinement. Rounds of conjugate gradient energy minimization and model adjustment were performed until the R-factor stabilized (at 25%). Solvent molecules and two sulfate anions were added to positions where the difference Fo-Fc electron density was at least 3 and there was good geometry and distances to allow hydrogen bonding. Further cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization and model adjustment were then performed. The two C-terminal residues of the protein exhibited poor electron density (Gln152) or insufficient electron density (Gly153), and the latter was not included in the final model. Several other structural reports of native and mutant hh Mbs indicate similar lack of clearly defined electron density45,46 and/or high disorder47­ 49 for these two residues. Mb(EtNO) After the rotation and translation search, the initial model had an R-factor of 30.70%. Rigid body refinement lowered the R-factor to 28.91%. Well-defined electron density for the nitrosoethane ligand was apparent in the initial Fo-Fc electron density map. The nitrosoethane ligand was then modeled into this density, and its position and geometric parameters were unrestrained throughout refinement. Further rounds of refinement and model adjustment were performed until the R-factor stabilized (at 26%). An Fo-Fc electron density map showed negative density in the vicinity of the nitrosoethane ligand, indicating partial occupancy of the ligand. Consequently, unrestrained individual occupancy refinement was performed. All atoms of the nitrosoethane ligand refined to occupancies of 0.6. The ligand occupancy was consistent with our UV-vis spectroscopic data, which suggested a 40% conversion of the ferrous Mb(EtNO) complex to aqua-metMb under the crystallization conditions. This led to the modeling of a water molecule as an alternate sixth ligand to iron (for the aqua-metMb contribution) with an occupancy of 0.4. Water molecules and two sulfate anions were added to the structure by using an Fo-Fc electron density map. Further cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization and model adjustment were subsequently performed. As with the hh MbNO structure, poor electron density was observed for the two C-terminal residues Gln152 and Gly153. The final crystallographic R-factors (Rfree calculated by using 10% of randomly selected reflections) were 19.5% (Rfree 25.0%) and 19.8% (Rfree 22.7%) for the MbNO and Mb(EtNO) structures, respectively. Coordinates for both structures have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank50 with access codes 1NPF (for hh MbNO) and 1NPG [for hh Mb(EtNO)]. X-ray data collection and refinement statistics for hh MbNO and hh Mb(EtNO) are summarized in Table I. Figures 1, 3, and 4 were prepared by using PYMOL.52

RESULTS Nitrosyl Myoglobin The heme environment from the X-ray crystal structure of hh MbNO is shown in Figure 1. The protein backbone retains its typical Mb fold with no significant differences observed from other reported hh Mb structures and is not discussed further. Chemically the most interesting new feature of the structure is the nitrosyl FeNO moiety. The NO ligand was clearly defined in the initial electron density map, and this ligand refined to unit occupancy. The Fe-N(nitrosyl) and N-O distances are 2.0 and 1.14 Å, respectively, and the Fe-N(porphyrin) distances are 2.0 Å. The Fe-N-O angle is 147°, and the nitrosyl ligand is oriented toward Leu29 (at a distance of 4.1 Å) in the general direction of the protein interior. The nitrosyl N atom is positioned 3.0 Å from the imidazole N atom of the distal His64 residue, and the nitrosyl O atom is 3.2 Å from this imidazole N atom. These observations are suggestive of electrostatic stabilization of the FeNO moiety via hydrogen-bonding interaction with the distal His64 residue. The next closest nonbonding distances between the NO ligand and distal residues are those with Val68; the nitrosyl O and N atoms are 3.2 Å from the C 2 atom of Val68. Other distances between the NO ligand and the distal residues are 3.7 Å. The axial ligand orientations for MbNO are shown in Figure 1(b). The Fe atom is situated in the mean porphyrin plane, and the axial (His93)N-Fe-N(O) bond angle is 170°. The imidazole plane of the trans axial His93 ligand lies in the general direction along diagonal porphyrin N atoms, with a (His93)C-N-Fe-N(por) torsion angle of 10°. The angle between the plane defined by the FeNO moiety and the plane of the imidazole ring of the proximal His93 ligand is 18°. Nitrosoethane Myoglobin X-ray crystal structural analysis of hh Mb(EtNO) revealed that the protein retained its normal Mb fold, as observed in the previous structure of hh MbNO. Initial electron density maps clearly indicated the presence of the nitrosoethane ligand, which refined to an occupancy of 60%. Although the hh Mb(EtNO) complex is stable in aqueous buffer in air for several weeks (showing no signs of decomposition as judged by UV-vis spectroscopy), it slowly converts to aqua-metMb under our crystallization conditions in the presence of ammonium sulfate (Fig. 2). Suitably sized crystals took 5 days to form, during which a 40% conversion to aqua-metMb also occurred. This latter observation is consistent with the partial occupancy of the EtNO ligand in the hh Mb(EtNO) crystal structure. The crystal structure of the heme environment in hh Mb(EtNO) is shown in Figure 3. The EtNO ligand is N-bound to the ferrous center with an Fe-N(EtNO) distance of 2.1 Å. The Fe-N(His93) distance is 2.1 Å, and the Fe-N(porphyrin) distances are 2.0 Å. The axial (His93)NFe-N(EtNO) angle is 166°, and the Fe atom is positioned in the mean porphyrin plane. The N-O distance is 1.26 Å, and the Fe-N-O and C-N-O angles are 117° and 119°, respectively. Unlike hh MbNO, however, the NO moiety in

Mb(EtNO) is oriented toward the distal His64 residue with a 2.7 Å distance between the nitrosoethane O atom and the N atom of His64, suggestive of a hydrogen-bonding interaction between these groups. The ethyl group of the EtNO ligand is oriented in the direction in-between the hydrophobic residues Phe43 and Ileu107. The closest nonbonding interactions of the ethyl group of EtNO with the distal residues of the protein are between the C2 atom of EtNO and Leu29 (3.2 Å) and that between the C1 atom of EtNO and Val68 (3.5 Å). The axial ligand orientations are shown in Figure 3(c). DISCUSSION Adduct formation between NO and ferrous hemes result in the generation of {FeNO}7 species using the {MNO}n classification of Enemark and Feltham.2,53,54 The number "n" represents the number of valence electrons of the metal ion (e.g., d6 ferrous ion), and the single unpaired electron from the * antibonding orbital of NO. These {FeNO}7 heme compounds are also commonly referred to as ferrous heme-NO species, although these compounds are paramagnetic with appreciable spin density on iron.15,55,56 Molecular orbital analyses of octahedral {FeNO}7 systems predict

a bent Fe-N-O geometry with an angle of 145 10°,53 and the bent Fe-N-O geometry is consistent with spectroscopic studies of ferrous nitrosyl hemes.2,57­59 In contrast, the related description of the ferric heme-NO {FeNO}6 systems (i.e., d5 metal ion and a * electron from NO) predict a linear FeNO moiety in these compounds. A recent report has showed the occurrence of a bent FeNO bond in the formally ferric {FeNO}6 complex (OEP)Fe(NO)(p-C6H4F) (OEP octaethylporphyrinato dianion). In this latter report, the unexpectedly bent FeNO bond geometry was attributed to a favorable combination of axial NO tilting and bending to result in the FeNO angle of 157° (the nitrosyl N atom was tilted off of the normal to the heme plane by 9.2°).60 Related off-axis tilting of the nitrosyl N-atoms from the heme normal have been observed in the wild-type, S286V, and S286T mutants of the ferric heme-NO compounds of fungal nitric oxide reductase (Fe-N-O angles of 161­165°).61 A bent nitrosyl geometry (123 and 135°) in crystals of ferric nitrosyl nitrophorin 1 from Rhodnius prolixus was attributed to photoreduction of the crystals during X-ray data collection and NOinduced autoreduction of the ferric center.62

X-ray crystallographic studies of synthetic heme model complexes of the form {FeNO}7 display bent FeNO geometries with angles ranging from 137 to 149°, consistent with the prediction of Enemark and Feltham.53,54 However, a much wider range of FeNO bond angles of 110 ­ 155° is observed in the single-crystal X-ray structures of nitrosyl heme proteins belonging to the {FeNO}7 classification. Geometrical data for synthetic and natural {FeNO}7 systems are shown in Table II. The 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of hh MbNO at low temperature (100 K) provides an interesting comparison with the structure determined from the MS XAFS study of a frozen aqueous solution of hh MbNO (10 K)19 and with

the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structure of the related sw MbNO at room temperature.20 The Fe-N(porphyrin) bond lengths in the crystal of hh MbNO (2.0 Å) are similar to those obtained from the XAFS study of hh MbNO (2.0 Å average). For comparison, the related bond lengths from the crystal structure of sw MbNO are 2.03­2.13 Å. The proximal Fe-His bond length of 2.1 Å from the crystal structure of hh MbNO is close to the Fe-His length determined from the XAFS study of hh MbNO (2.05 Å average) and from the crystal structure of sw MbNO (2.18 Å) and is within the 1.98 ­2.31 Å range observed in heme-NO proteins containing proximal His ligands (Table II). The Fe-N-O angle of 147° obtained from the crystal structure of hh MbNO is similar to the corresponding 150° angle determined from the XAFS study of hh MbNO at low temperature. This 147° angle in hh MbNO is within the 137­149° range in heme model compounds and is consistent with that expected for a {FeNO}7 model heme-NO complex (Table II). However, the Fe-N(O) bond length of 2.0 Å is longer than the 1.75 Å distance in model heme-NO compounds and is at the upper end of the 1.74 ­2.03 Å range found in six-coordinate nitrosyl hemeproteins (Table II). It is important that an Fe-N(O) distance of 1.75 Å was accurately determined from the XAFS study of hh MbNO, and we suggest that the 2.0 Å distance in the crystal structure of hh MbNO is likely due to the use of a preformed aqua-metMb crystal for the preparation of hh MbNO for the crystal structure determination. Thus, the slightly longer Fe-N(O) bond length enables an increased electrostatic interaction between the nitrosyl ligand and the His64 residue in the preformed distal pocket. The nitrosyl N atom of hh MbNO is within hydrogen-bonding distance (3.0 Å) of the N atom of the distal His64 residue, as shown in Figure 1(a). A shorter imposed Fe-N(O) bond length of 1.75 Å [which would place the N atom at the bottom edge of the observed electron density; Fig. 1(a)] would result in an increased distance of

3.2 Å between the nitrosyl N atom and the N atom of the distal His64 residue and a subsequent decreased electrostatic interaction between these groups. Brucker and coworkers20 have suggested that electrostatic interactions with the distal His residue in sw MbNO contribute to the observed nitrosyl ligand geometry in their crystal structure. The crystal of sw MbNO used in their study was similarly obtained by nitrosylation of preformed sw aqua-metMb crystals. An Fe-N(O) bond length of 1.89 Å and an Fe-N-O angle of 112° were determined by using room temperature X-ray diffraction data. There is a 97% average homology for the 20 amino acids found within 5 Å of the heme of sw Mb and hh Mb.87 The superposition of the single-crystal X-ray structures of hh MbNO and sw MbNO (both crystallize in the P21 space group) shows no major differences in the positioning of residues in the heme environment (Fig. 4); however, the Fe-NO geometry is different. It is interesting that variable temperature EPR studies on sw MbNO predict a temperature dependence on the Fe-N-O angle, with larger angles (e.g., 153° at 293 K) expected at room temperature and smaller angles (e.g., 109° at 77 K) expected at lower temperatures.17 The Fe-N-O angle of 112° determined in sw MbNO using room temperature diffraction data is smaller than that expected for a ferrous {FeNO}7 complex, and this small angle was attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the NO ligand with the distal His residue in the preformed distal pocket. Thus, it is conceivable that the replacement of the axial water in the aqua-metMb crystal with NO might force the NO ligand to adopt the smaller angle in the crystal structure of sw MbNO. Brucker and coworkers20 also determined an Fe-N-O angle of 127° for the L29F/D122N mutant of sw MbNO (PDB access code 1JDO; this mutant crystallizes in the more loosely packed space group P6) from 1.9 Å resolution data, showing the effects of crystal packing and electrostatics within the heme distal pocket on the Fe-N-O bond geometry. Clearly, results from high-resolution crystal structures of MbNO are needed to fully elucidate the effects of subtle changes in heme environments and temperature on the Fe-NO geometry in crystals of nitrosyl myoglobins. Therefore, we reaffirm an earlier suggestion that caution must be exercised in the interpretation of the geometrical parameters of the Fe-NO group obtained from crystallographic studies of nitrosyl derivatives prepared from aqua-metMb crystals, because the nitrosyl ligand position and orientation may be influenced by factors such as the method of crystal preparation.19 To the best of our knowledge, the X-ray crystal structure of hh Mb(EtNO) (Fig. 3) is the first such determination to be reported for a nitrosoalkane complex of a heme protein. Results from model heme-nitrosoalkane complexes predict an N-binding mode in ferrous porphyrins, in which the RNO ligand acts as a -acid ligand.3 Selected structural data for ferrous nitrosoalkane and nitrosoarene hemes are collected in Table III. The structure of hh Mb(EtNO) reveals an N-bound nitrosoalkane ligand as shown in Figure 3. In high-

resolution X-ray crystal structures of model heme complexes containing nitrosoalkane or nitrosoarene ligands, the Fe-N(nitroso) distances are found to be generally shorter (1.8 ­1.9 Å) than the trans Fe-N(axial) bond lengths (2.0 ­2.1 Å). However, in hh Mb(EtNO), the Fe-N(nitroso) and the trans Fe-N(His) distances are both 2.1 Å. The axial distances in hh Mb(EtNO) are, however, similar to those

determined in the structure of the nitrosobenzene complex legHb(PhNO) (2.10 and 2.17 Å, respectively).40 The ethyl group of the EtNO ligand is positioned on the side of the distal pocket away from the His64 residue to minimize the steric clash of these two groups. Indeed, the axial ligand orientation of the EtNO group appears to be influenced by the distal His64 residue, whose presence causes the CNO plane to be tilted off of the heme normal by 36° [Fig. 3(b)] in a direction away from His 64. The result is a hydrogen-bonding distance of 2.7 Å between the nitroso O atom and the N atom of His64. In contrast, the dominant hydrogen-bonding interaction between the nitrosyl group in hh MbNO and the distal His64 is via the nitrosyl N-atom (Fig. 1), although the participation of nitrosyl O atoms in distal hydrogen-bond interactions has been observed in the NO adducts of cyt c from A. xylosoxidans (with Arg124),80 cyt cd1 nitrite reductase from P. aeruginosa (with His369),82 and sulfite reducase heme protein (with Arg153 and Lys215).85 The axial (His93)NFe-N(EtNO) angle of 166° in hh Mb(EtNO) deviates from strict linearity, but such a deviation is not unusual even in high-resolution structures of heme compounds (the corresponding angle in hh MbNO is 170°; the nitrosyl N atom in hh MbNO is tilted 8° off of the normal to the 24-atom mean porphyrin plane). Off-axis tilts of axial ligands from the heme normal are frequently observed in natural and model heme complexes, and these off-axis tilts have been analyzed computationally, structurally, and spectroscopically by others.17,18,60,68,89 ­93 CONCLUSION We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of hh MbNO, and we show that the Fe-N-O bond angle in this myoglobin derivative is 147°, which is consistent with that predicted from model heme-NO studies. The X-ray crystal structure of the nitrosoalkane complex hh Mb(EtNO) was also determined. There are marked axial ligand orienta-

Fig. 4. A superposition of the heme environments in the single-crystal X-ray structures of hh MbNO (this work, shown in red) and sw MbNO (Ref. 20, shown in green) using a global C structural alignment. There is a significant difference in the Fe-N-O bond angles between the two structures (147° for hh MbNO and 112° for sw MbNO).

tion differences between hh MbNO and hh Mb(EtNO), and these differences correlate with different electrostatic stabilizations of the ligands by the distal His64 residue. Thus, X-ray crystal structural studies designed to examine axial ligand binding modes, geometries, and orientations of NO and NO-containing ligands as a function of His64 mutation should provide valuable information toward a better understanding of binding affinities to the heme site in Mb.
