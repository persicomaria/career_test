Four novel flavonol 0-methyltransferases (OMTs) were partially purified from Chrysosplenium americanum by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, successive chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 and hydroxylapatite, and chromatofocusing on Polybuffer ion exchanger. They exhibited strict position specificity for positions 3 of quercetin, `7 of 3-methylquercetin, 4' of 3,7-dimethylquercetin, and 6 of 3,7,3'-trimethylquercetagetin. None of these enzymes reacted with phenylpropanoids, flavones, dihydroflavonols, or any of their glucosides. Except for the 7-OMT whose activity was lost during chromatofocusing, the other enzymes had apparent pI values of 4.8, 5.4, and 5.7 for the 3-, 4'-, and 6-OMTs, respectively. They had similar molecular weights (&& 57,000) and their pH optima varied between 7.8 and 9.0, with a shift in optimal activity from lower to higher pH with increasing level of substrate methylation. Unlike the 3 and 4' enzymes, the 6-OMT showed an absolute requirement for Mg2+ whose activation was saturable and was inhibited by EDTA. The in vitro stepwise Omethylation of quercetin - 3-methylquercetin - 3,7-dimethylquercetin - 3,7,4'-trimethylquercetin tends to suggest a coordinated sequence of methyl transfers in this tissue. 0 1985AcademicPress,Inc. Flavonoid compounds are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and may be characterized by methyl ether substitution at various positions on the flavonoid ring system (1, 2). Enzymatic O-methylation, which is catalyzed by OMT3 (EC 2.1.1.6), is believed to play a role in detoxification of reactive hydroxyl groups on the flavonoid ring. Several OMTs have been reported to mediate the transfer of methyl groups from SAM to different hydroxyls of flavonoid compounds (3-10). However, none of these enzymes has been shown to accept partially methylated compounds for further methylation. Recent work in this laboratory demonstrated the stepwise methylation of a number of flavonoid substrates, including quercetin, to various methylated derivatives by partially purified preparations of Calamondin orange (11, 12) and Chrgsosplenium americanurn tissues (13, 14). Furthermore, these enzyme preparations accepted partially methylated substrates and transformed them to the next higher order of methylation (ll-14), thus indicating the involvement of several OMTs. More recently, we demonstrated the presence of three novel OMTs in C. americanum and established their role in the sequential methylation of flavonols in this tissue (15). The latter is known to synthe596

The enzymatic synthesis of these highly methylated flavonols is particularly interesting since early methylated intermediates do not accumulate in

In this report, we extend earlier observations (15) and describe the purification of four Chrysosplenium OMTs, on a preparative level, as well as some of their properties. Because of the position specificity of these enzymes, the purification procedure required assays with five key flavonol substrates which were methylated at different positions as shown below: + SAH + SAH + SAH + SAH + SAH + SAH

Plant material. C americanurn Schwein ex Hooker (Saxifragaceae) was collected from Sutton Junction, Province of Quebec, and was maintained under controlled conditions of light, temperature, and humidity. Chemicals S-Adenosyl-L-[methyl-`4C]methionine (60 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham (Oakville, Ontario); cold SAM was obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim (Germany). Most commercially unvailable flavonoid compounds were generous gifts from Dr. M. Jay, University of Lyon, and Professor E. Wollenweber, Darmstadt. Other flavonoid substrates were purchased from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany) and Sarsyntex (Bordeaux, France) and were further purified by recrystallization or preparative TLC. Sephacryl S-200, Polybuffer ion exchanger (PBE-94) and Polybuffer (PB-`74) were from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HT) was from Bio-Rad (Richmond, Calif.). Imidazole was recrystallized from ethyl acetate. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Buffers. The following buffers were used: A, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM diethylammonium diethyldithiocarbamate, 14 mM 2mercaptoethanol; B, 25 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 M NaCl; C, buffer B without NaCl; D, 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol. Protein extraction The procedure used for protein

extraction and enzyme purification was a modification of that previously described (15). Unless stated otherwise, all procedures were carried out at 2-4°C. Young shoot tips (ca. 9Og) were frozen in liquid nitrogen, mixed with Polyclar AT (10% w/w), and homogenized in a blender with 500 ml buffer A. All components in the buffer were required to obtain a colorless protein extract and to preserve enzyme activity. The slurry was filtered through nylon mesh and the filtrate was centrifuged for 15 min at 20,OOOg. The supernatant was stirred with Dowex 1 X 2 (10% w/v) which had previously been equilibrated with 0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.6, and then filtered. The filtrate was fractionated with solid ammonium sulfate and the protein fraction which precipitated between 35 and 70% salt saturation was collected by centrifugation. Enzyme pur$cation. The protein pellet was suspended in 10 ml buffer B and chromatographed on a Sephacryl S-200 column, preequilibrated with the same buffer. The column was developed with buffer B and 4-ml fractions were collected for OMT assay against the five flavonol substrates. The active fractions were applied onto a hydroxylapatite column which had previously been equilibrated with buffer C. Two peaks of enzyme activity were eluted after applying a linear gradient of phosphate (O-100 mM) in buffer C. Each of the latter peaks was then subjected to chromatofocusing on Polybuffer ion

exchanger, preequilibrated with buffer C. Enzyme activity was eluted with Polybuffer:water (1:8, v/v), pH 4.0, 20% glycerol, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The latter generated a pH gradient between pH 7 and 4, so that each protein was recovered at its apparent isoelectric point (PI). In order to eliminate Polybuffer and concentrate the enzyme protein, the chromatofocused fractions were applied to hydroxylapatite and OMT activity was eluted batchwise with buffer D. O-Methyltramfa-ase assag. Standard enzyme assays were performed as described previously (13) using S-adenosyl-L-[m&yl-"C]methionine as methyl donor. The methylated products were extracted in a mixture of henzene:ethyl acetate (l:l, v/v), and an aliquot of the organic phase was counted for radioactivity in a toluene-based scintillation fluid. The remaining fraction was chromatographed on Polyamide-6 MN forTLC plates in solvent systems A, toluene:ethyl mate:butyl acetate:formic acid (25:50:23:2); or B, benzene:methylethylketone:methanol (4:3:3). Identity of the methylated products was confirmed by cochromatography with reference compounds, visualization in uv light (366 nm), and autoradiography on X-ray film. Moleculur weight determination Each of the chromatofocused enzymes was applied to a Sephacryl S200 column which had previously been calibrated with ribonuclease A, chymotripsinogen A, ovalbumin, albumin, and aldolase as reference proteins. The apparent molecular weight was estimated from the elution volume of each enzyme (16, 17). Protein estimatia. Protein concentration was de-

termined according to the method of Bradford (18), using the Bio-Rad protein reagent and bovine serum albumin as standard protein. RESULTS

Pur&mtion of individual OMTS The purification procedure previously described (15) was modified in order to prepare large amounts of purified enzymes for property studies and kinetic analysis. Chromatography on Sephacryl S-200 resulted in the elution of all OMTs in a discrete peak (profile not shown) and elimination of chlorophyll contaminants. Hydroxylapatite chromatography gave two peaks of activity (Fig. 2). Peak 1 was variably active against all five substrates (Figs. 2B and C) whereas peak 2 was only active against quercetin, 3,7-dimethylquercetin and 3,7-dimethylquercetagetin. This purification step permitted the separation of the 6- and 7-OMTs from the majority of the 3 and 4' enzymes. When each hydroxylapatite peak was submitted to chromatofocusing, the 6-OMT was eluted at its apparent isoelectric point (pH 5.7) free from contaminating 3 or 4' activities (Fig. 3A). The 7-OMT activity was lost during chromatofocusing, possi-

FIG. 2. Protein elution profile from a hydroxylapatite column. (A) The OMT activity from a Sephacryl S-200 column (in 0.5 mM KCl) was applied onto hydroxylapatite preequilibrated with buffer C. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient (O-100 mM) of phosphate in the same buffer. Note that the high conductivity observed in the applied sample was due to high salt present in the sample buffer. (B, C) Fractions were assayed against quercetin (Q) (O), 3-methyl-Q (A), 3,7-dimethyl-Q (W), 3,7-dimethylquercetagetin (Qg) (0), and 3,7,3'-trimethylQg (0).

Stability of enzymes. Partially purified enzyme preparations (desalted ammonium sulfate pellets) lost 80% of their activity over a period of 4-6 weeks at 4°C. Purified enzymes were stable when stored at -15°C in buffer D for several months. Substrate spec$city. The substrate specificity of the four OMTs studied is summarized in Table II. The OMT, which focused at pH 4.8, was specific for the 3 position of flavonols with 3',4' (or 4'5') hydroxylation pattern such as quercetin (Fig. 4), but not quercetagetin, the 6-OH analog. Furthermore, the latter did not act as a substrate inhibitor when added at concentrations of up to 80 PM to enzyme assays (Fig. 5). Introduction of a methyl group at the `7 position of quercetin (as in rhamnetin) resulted in a `70% drop in

bly due to instability of the enzyme in the purified form or to the loss of some factor required for its activity. The 3- and 4'-OMTs were further separated on a second Polybuffer ion exchanger and eluted at pH 4.8 and 5.4, respectively (Fig. 3B). This procedure assured that the 6- and 4'OMTs, whose apparent PI'S differed only by 0.3 pH units, were not cross-contaminated. The combined purification steps described above resulted in an increase in specific activity of the three focused enzymes of 85-, 92-, and 164-fold for the 3-, 6-, and 4'-OMTs, respectively, as compared with those of the crude enzyme preparation (Table I). The 7-OMT which copurified with the 6-OMT on hydroxylapatite showed a g-fold increase in specific activity

activity (Table II), whereas methyl substitution at the 3' position (as in isorhamnetin) or 4' position (as in tamarixetin) resulted in a complete loss of activity. Furthermore, the former compounds were good product inhibitors with inhibition constants of the same order of magnitude as for 3-methylquercetin (data not shown). Such strict position specificity indicates that quercetin is the natural substrate for this enzyme and that 3-methylation may be the first step in the sequential methylation of these flavonols (Fig. 1). The 7-OMT, which was studied in the hydroxylapatite fraction, accepted 3methylquercetin for further methylation at the 7 position (Table II, Fig. 4). 3Methylquercetagetin was not available as

a substrate; however, the enzyme was unable to methylate any of the mono-, di-, or trimethyl derivatives tested. The specificity of this enzyme toward the 7-position of quercetin suggests that 7-0-methylation is the next step in the sequential methyl transfers of Chrysosplenium flavonoids. The two other protein fractions which focused at pH 5.4 and 5.7 accepted partially methylated flavonol intermediates for further 0-methylation at the 4' and 6 positions, respectively. The 4'-OMT converted both 3,7-dimethylquercetin and its 6-hydroxy analog equally well to their respective 4'-methyl derivatives (Table II, Fig. 4). The 6-OMT accepted 3,7-dimethylquercetagetin and 3,7,3'-trimethylquercetagetin, producing their respective 6-

The fact that the 4'-OMT did not react with trimethyl substrates, such as 3,6,7-trimethylquercetagetin, suggests that 4 methylation may precede that at position 6, thus establishing the third and fourth steps in the sequential methylation of these flavonols. None of the four enzymes described here exhibited any activity with phenylpropanoids, flavones, dihydroflavonols, or any of their glucosides, thus indicating their specificity toward hydroxylated and partially methylated flavonols. pH optima. The pH optima of the four OMTs ranged between 7.8 and 9.0 (Fig. 6). However, optimal activity shifted from lower to higher pH with increasing methylation of the substrate used, so that the 3- and 7-OMTs exhibited optimal activity between pH 7.8 and 8.2, as compared with pH 8.8 to 9.0 for the 6- and 4'-OMTs. These differences in pH optima may indicate the degree of dissociation of the specific hydroxyl groups to be methylated.

of enzyme activity (Table III). The former was particularly effective at 1 mM in inhibiting the three OMTs, whereas the addition of 14 MM 2mercaptoethanol partially prevented this inhibition. These data indicate that, whereas no reducing agent may be required for 0-methylation, binding of SH-group inhibitors to the enzyme resulted in its inactivation. Molecular weight. Both crude preparations as well as purified OMTs had the same elution volume, giving an approximate molecular weight of 57,000 (data not shown). This compares well with previous estimates of 65,000 on Sephadex G-100 (15).

The four OMTs described in this report confirm previous observations (15) and establish a preparative procedure for the complete separation of the 3-, 6-, and 4'OMTs. However, the 7-OMT activity was lost during chromatofocusing. These enzymes together with other yet to be iden-

These results are in contrast with those reported earlier (15), which were obtained with crude enzyme preparations. Further investigation of the effect of Mg2+ indicated that its activation of 6-OMT was saturable (Fig. 7). Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. `7, inset) were linear, with 30 PM Mg2+ required for half-maximal saturation. When the effect of EDTA was investigated (Table III) it was found to inhibit the 6-OMT, 90 iao whereas it had no effect on the activity of either 3- or 4'-OMT. PH SH-group requirements.

Furthermore, panoid compounds or other intermediates of flavonol biosynthesis were accepted by these OMTs, thus supporting the view that 0-methylation of flavonoids occurs at the Cl5 level in Chrgsosplenium (19). It is not unexpected, therefore, that a polyhydroxyflavonol of common occurrence, such as quercetin, would be the natural methyl acceptor in the multiple sequence of methyl transfer. This is supported by the fact that 3-OMT exhibited its highest affinity and strict position specificity for this substrate. These results are in agreement with the findings of Brunet and Ibrahim (12), who demonstrated that a number of 3-hydroxyflavones displayed a high methyl acceptor ability which correlated with the highest nuclear electron density for the 3-hydroxyl group of havonols.
