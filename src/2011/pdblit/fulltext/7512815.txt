Abstract The fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeat is one of three structural motifs originally identified in the fibronectin protein and has been well characterized in recent years. The consensus sequence has since been found in many different proteins including receptors and cell adhesion molecules. We report the cloning and expression analysis of Frcp1 and Frcp2, two members of a new FNIII repeat containing gene family. During embryonic development both genes are primarily expressed in the brain. In adult tissues, Frcp1 is strongly expressed in the liver and Frcp2 in the heart. q 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction The extracellular matrix protein fibronectin plays an important role in cell adhesion. The protein contains fibronectin type I, II and III domains. All three domains have been well characterized. The fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeat is generally about 90 amino acids long and 15­17 of these repeats can be found in the fibronectin protein (Ruoslahti, 1988). A characteristic of FNIII repeats is the presence of conserved tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the N- and C-terminal portions of the repeat (Bruemmendorf and Rathjen, 1993). Using NMR techniques, the FNIII repeat structure has been shown to be composed of seven b-strands, forming two antiparallel b-sheets. An Arg-GlyAsp (RGD) module within the FNIII domain conveys cell adhesive properties to a number of proteins (Main et al., 1992). Since the initial identification of the FNIII repeat in fibronectin, this domain has been found to be present in many animal and bacterial proteins, but has not been seen in

plants or fungal proteins. In general, proteins containing FNIII domains can function as receptors or cell adhesion molecules. Proteins functioning as receptors include the insulin receptor family, the human growth hormone receptor, the erythropoietin receptor and several interleukin receptors. Fibronectin, tenascin and some members of the collagen family are cell surface proteins involved in cell adhesion (Bork and Doolittle, 1992; Marino-Buslje et al., 1998). Cell surface proteins containing FNIII repeats can influence neuronal development as shown for different members of the IgG-superfamily. Blocking the FNIII repeats of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) with a monoclonal antibody disturbed the axonal growth pattern and fasciculation in chicken retina (Pollerberg and Beck-Sickinger, 1993). Furthermore, expression studies and loss of function experiments on punc, a gene with a similar organization of FNIII and IgG domains, suggest a role in early development and in motor coordination (Salbaum, 1998; Yang et al., 2001). We now report the cloning and the analysis of expression and subcellular localization of two new genes that contain FNIII repeats and are members of a new gene family. 2. Methods 2.1. Cloning and sequencing Frcp1 and Frcp2 fragments were subcloned from a BAC clone isolated from an arrayed mouse 129 genomic library

(Incyte Genomics). By PCR (primers: 5 0 -GGATGTCAAGCGGATGCCAAGC-3 0 and 5 0 -CACGAAGCCCAGGTCACAGC-3 0 ), BAC 127H10 was identified to contain the genomic region for Frcp1. Frcp2 is encoded by BAC 217J06 (primers: 5 0 -AGAAGAAGGATGTGCGGATGCTCC-3 0 and 5 0 -CTTGAAGAGCACAGGCTCACTGG-3 0 ). Sequencing was performed by the Biopolymer Laboratory of the University of Maryland at Baltimore. Sequence analysis and protein prediction were performed using NCBI BLAST and the Baylor University BCM Search Launcher Web Sites. 2.2. Northern hybridization Northern hybridizations were performed on Clontech mouse MTN blots following the manufacturer's instructions. Probes were obtained by PCR from full-length ESTs (Frcp1: BI753191; Frcp2: BF445046) and subcloned using the TOPO PCR Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Frcp1-primers: 5 0 CACGGTCCTCCTGCTGGTCAGC-3 0 and 5 0 -AACGTCGATGGTGTTGATAGATGG-3 0 . Frcp2-primers:5 0 -AGTGAGCCTGTGCTCTTCAAGACC-3 0 and 5 0 -CTCATTCTGCAGCTCTGTCTCTGG-3 0 . Probes were labeled using the High Prime labeling kit (Roche). 2.3. Whole-mount in situ hybridization Whole-mount in situ hybridizations using digoxigeninlabeled probes (Section 2.2) were performed as described (Saga et al., 1992). For anti-sense probes TOPO/Frcp1 was digested with SpeI and TOPO/Frcp2 with HindIII, and each was labeled with digoxigenin using T7 RNA-Polymerase (Roche). 2.4. GFP-fusion vector To obtain a GFP-fusion vector, a full-length EST was cloned in-frame in the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech). COS cells were grown on glass slides in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin­streptomycin and DNA was transfected using Fugene transfectant reagent (Roche). After 48

h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subcellular localization was analysed using FITC following the manufacturer's instructions.

3. Results and discussion 3.1. cDNA structure, protein domains and genomic structure The predicted fibronectin type III repeat containing protein 1 (Frcp1) contains 219 amino acids with three identifiable domains (Fig. 1). An N-terminal signal peptide is formed by amino acids 1­30, followed by an 84-aminoacid fibronectin type III domain spanning amino acids 31­ 114. The final domain is a 22-amino-acid transmembrane domain from amino acid 151 to 172. The genomic region of Frcp1 spans 3.2 kb and was cloned in three overlapping fragments. The region was sequenced and the sequence submitted to GenBank. Comparison of homology between the NCBI human and Mouse Genome Database indicated that Frcp1 is located on mouse chromosome 5. Comparison of the genomic sequence to the full-length cDNA revealed that the gene is organized in seven exons and six introns. The deduced cDNA matches an uncharacterized mouse sequence that has been deposited in GenBank (accession no. AK026015). All the splicing donor and acceptor sites follow the GT/AG rule (Balvay et al., 1993). The coding region is contained in exons 2­7. Exons 2­6 contain most of the coding region and are relatively small, ranging from 97 to 207 bp. The translation start of Frcp1 is located in exon 2. The first exon and parts of the second exon belong to the 5 0 -untranslated region. The translational stop site is located in exon seven with most of this exon containing 3 0 -untranslated sequences. The signal peptide is encoded by exons 2 and 3, the fibronectin type III repeat is split between exons 3 and 4, and the transmembrane domain is found in exons 5 and 6. Due to sequence similarities in the FNIII domain a second family member in mouse, Frcp2, was identified through

a BLAST search against the high-throughput genome sequences. The accession number for this sequence is AL606977 and it has been mapped to mouse chromosome 4. Frcp2 has a 60% identity with Frcp1 in the FNIII domain and 86% identity in the transmembrane domain. Like Frcp1, a signal peptide is found at the N-terminus of the protein. The Frcp2 protein consists of 203 amino acids. The signal peptide is represented by amino acids 1­30, the fibronectin type III domain spans amino acids 31­114 and the transmembrane domain is found between amino acids 151 and 172. Frcp2 spans 5.1 kb and is organized in six exons. The translation start of Frcp2 is in exon 1. The signaling peptide is encoded by exons 1 and 2, the fibronectin type III domain by exons 2 and 3, and the transmembrane domain is split between exons 4 and 5. The exon boundaries of the coding portions of Frcp1 and Frcp2 are found at identical locations of the polypeptides, suggesting that these genes evolved from a common ancestor. Both genes have human homologs that are highly conserved ð.95% amino acid homology). However, although FNIII domains have been found in fly, worm and bacteria (Bork and Doolittle, 1992), no homologs of Frcp1 or Frcp2 were found in invertebrates via BLAST search against the Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans and microbial genome databases. 3.2. Analysis of mRNA expression in adult tissues by Northern hybridization By Northern hybridization with Frcp1, strongest expression was detected in the adult brain and liver tissue. Frcp1 is also expressed at low levels in heart, lung, kidney and testis. Like Frcp1, Frcp2 is expressed strongly in the brain (Fig. 2). However, high levels of Frcp2 mRNA transcripts also exist in the heart. Low levels of Frcp2 are found in lung, skeletal muscle and testis. We observed two mRNA transcripts in the Northern hybridization of Frcp1 suggesting alternative splicing. The mRNA transcripts were 2 and 3 kb in size, respectively. These two transcripts were also present in Northern blots of embryonic tissues (data not

shown). In most tissues transcripts are expressed at similar levels. By contrast, in the adult liver the 2 kb transcript is expressed at a much higher level than the longer transcript. 3.3. Analysis of mRNA expression during embryonic development by Northern hybridization and whole-mount in situ hybridization Both genes are expressed during mouse embryonic development (data not shown). Northern hybridization for Frcp1 on mouse embryonic mRNA representing embryonic days (E) 7, 11, 15 and 17 shows strongest expression at E11 and decreasing expression at days E15 and E17. No signal was detectable at E7. Frcp2 expression increases during embryonic development. By Northern hybridization expression was not detectable at day E7. Expression was found at day E11 and increasingly strong expression at day E15. At E17 expression decreases again. Whole-mount in situ hybridization at E9.5 demonstrated expression of both genes in the head (Fig. 3). In addition, Frcp2 is also expressed in the branchial arches and the heart. At E10.5 both genes are expressed in the fore- and midbrain. The expression of Frcp2 is sharply defined whereas the expression of Frcp1 is extended into the hindbrain region. At E11.5 the expression pattern stays the same with both genes being expressed in the fore- and midbrain, but Frcp1 is also expressed in the hindbrain region. The genes show partially overlapping but distinct expression profiles in the developing embryo and the adult mouse, suggesting each gene may have unique functions. 3.4. Analysis of the subcellular localization of Frcp1 In order to determine the subcellular localization of Frcp1, a GFP­Frcp1 fusion protein was overexpressed in COS cells (Fig. 4). The protein appears predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum of these transiently transfected cells. Punctuated structures are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Only small amounts of the fusion protein are found associated with the plasma membrane. We found

similar results with Frcp2 (data not shown). The presence of conserved Frcp transmembrane domains makes it likely that physiological amounts of these proteins localize to the plasma membrane. Their predominant localization to the endoplasmic reticulum of transfected cells could be due to aberrant export of a protein that is expressed at very high levels. FNIII containing plasma membrane proteins serve either as cell adhesion molecules or as receptors. As most FNIII type cell adhesion molecules contain ArgGly-Asp (RGD) modules or immunoglobulin repeats, it is likely that Frcp1 and Frcp2 are receptors of an as yet to be identified ligand.

4. Conclusions

1. We cloned, sequenced and analysed the expression of Frcp1 and Frcp2, two new fibronectin type III repeat containing genes. 2. The two genes show high homologies in the fibronectin type III and transmembrane domains and no homology elsewhere or to other proteins, suggesting that these genes belong to a new subclass of fibronectin type III proteins. 3. The strong expression of both members of the Frcp subfamily in embryonic brain and adult brain tissue

suggests a role of these two genes during embryonic head development and brain function. 4. In adult mouse tissues Frcp1 is strongly expressed in brain and liver and Frcp2 is strongly expressed in heart and brain. These expression patterns suggest specific functions of these genes in the respective tissues during adulthood.
