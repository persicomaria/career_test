Gelonin is a single chain ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) with potential application in the treatment of cancer and AIDS. Diffraction quality crystals grown using PEG3350, belong to the space group P21 , with a = 49.4 Å, b = 44.9 Å, c = 137.4 Å and beta = 98.4°, and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Diffraction data collected to 1.8 Å resolution has a Rm value of 7.3%. Structure of gelonin has been solved by the molecular replacement method, using ricin A chain as the search model. Crystallographic refinement using X-PLOR resulted in a model for which the r.m.s deviations from ideal bond lengths and bond angles are 0.012 Å and 2.7°, respectively. The final R-factor is 18.4% for 39,806 reflections for which I > 1.0s(I). The Ca atoms of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit superpose to within 0.38 Å for 247 atom pairs. The overall fold of gelonin is similar to that of other RIPs such as ricin A chain and a-momorcharin, the r.m.s.d. for Ca superpositions being 1.3 and 1.4 Å, respectively. The catalytic residues (Glu166, Arg169 and Tyr113) in the active site form a hydrogen bond scheme similar to that observed in other RIPs. The conformation of Tyr74 in the active site, however, is significantly different from that in a-momorcharin. Three well defined water molecules are located in the active site cavity, and one of them, X319, superposes to within 0.2 Å of a corresponding water molecule in the structure of a-momorcharin. Any of the three could be the substrate water molecule in the hydrolysis reaction catalysed by gelonin. Difference electron density for a N-linked sugar moiety has been observed near only one of the two potential glycosylation sites in the sequence. The amino acid at position 239 has been established as Lys by calculation of omit electron density maps. The two cysteine residues in the sequence, Cys44 and Cys50, form a disulphide bond, and are therefore not available for disulphide conjugation with antibodies. Based on the structure, the region of the molecule that is involved in intradimer interactions is suggested to be suitable for introducing a Cys residue for purposes of conjugation with an antibody to produce useful immunotoxins.

Introduction
Ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) are a class of plant proteins which inhibit protein synthesis via catalytic cleavage of a N-glycosidic bond in the 28 S ribosomal RNA from 60 S subunits of eukaryotic ribosomes (Stirpe et al., 1992, Endo et al., 1987; Olsnes & Phil, 1982). When presented with isolated rRNA the RIPs cleave the same bond as with intact ribosomes, but the activity is greatly reduced. While

all RIPs have similar activity on isolated rRNA, their activities on intact ribosomes from different organisms varies very widely in spite of similarity in nucleotide sequence on either side of the cleaved base. RIPs isolated from different parts of plants, are encoded by different genes often differing from one another by only a few codons (Chow et al., 1990; Halling et al., 1985). The RIPs have been divided into two types (Barbieri & Stirpe, 1982; Ramakrishnan et al., 1992): the type I RIPs (e.g. gelonin, a-trichosanthin, momorcharin, etc.) are single polypeptide chains, and are stable over a wide variety of physico-chemical conditions and have alkaline pI; the type II RIPs (e.g. ricin, abrin, modeccins etc.) consist of two polypeptide chains (A

and B) which are linked together by a disulphide bridge. Type II RIPs are similar to Shiga-like toxins produced by bacteria. The enzymic property is associated with the A-chain, while the B-chain is like a lectin, facilitating entry of the toxin into cells by binding non-specifically to galactose moieties on the cell surface (Lin et al., 1970, McIntosh et al., 1983). The amino acid sequence identity between type I RIPs and the A-chain of type II RIPs is in the range of 15 to 36%. Different RIPs cross-react with specific antisera only when they are produced by plants belonging to the same family. All RIPs are synthesised in vivo as inactive promolecules with extensions on amino and/or carboxyl ends, and are activated only after being transported to safe compartments within the cell. Many RIPs are glycoproteins with varying amounts and types of sugar molecules attached during post-translational modifications (Nolan et al., 1993; O'Hare et al., 1987). The function of these sugar molecules has not been fully understood, although their involvement in intracellular transport of RIPs has been suggested (Thorpe et al., 1981). In vitro experiments show that RIPs which lack these sugars cleave and inactivate ribosomes as efficiently as corresponding RIPs isolated from natural sources. The biological function of RIPs is poorly understood. However, most RIPs have been found to inhibit viral replication and fungal growth (Lord et al., 1991; Leads et al., 1991; Huang et al., 1992), and therefore self defence against viral and fungal attack is suggested to be the probable biological function of RIPs. Recently single chain RIPs (scRIP), such as a-trichosanthins and pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP), have been shown to inhibit replication of HIV in infected cells, at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than that necessary to kill uninfected cells (Zarling et al., 1990; Pan & Levy, 1994). The RIPs can be useful antitumour agents (Rybak et al., 1994) if they can be directed specifically into the tumour cells. Cell targeting is sought to be achieved by conjugating RIPs, through disulphide or thioether linkage, with monoclonal antibodies (Lambert et al., 1988) that are internalised on binding to cell-surface antigens (Frankel, 1988, Vitetta & Uhr, 1985). The glycosidase activity of the RIP is often reduced when conjugated through non-specific cross linkers (Thorpe et al., 1981; Singh et al., 1989; McIntyre et al., 1994). Direct conjugation, on the other hand, has been found to produce effective immunotoxins (Better et al., 1992, 1994; Dosio et al., 1994). The site for covalent conjugation can be best selected from a knowledge of the 3D structure of the specific RIP. X-ray structures of ricin and three scRIPs, a-momorcharin, PAP and a-trichosanthin, have been reported (Gao et al., 1994; Ren et al., 1994; Monzingo & Robertus, 1992; Monzingo et al., 1993). Based on high resolution structures of RIPs and their complexes with substrate analogues, two different, but somewhat related, molecular mechanisms have been proposed for the N-glycosidase activity of RIPs (Ren et al., 1994; Monzingo & Robertus, 1992). We

Results
Molecular replacement ° ° Model structure factors between 8 A and 4 A resolution, computed by placing all protein atoms of ricin A chain inside a triclinic orthogonal cell of size ° a = b = c = 100 A were used in the Patterson map calculations. Only Patterson densities inside a ° spherical shell of inner and outer radii of 5 and 30 A, respectively, were used in Patterson map superpositions. The highest few peaks in the cross rotation function map are listed in Table 1. From among these peaks the first and third are related by 2-fold rotation about an axis along psi = 13° and phi = 88°, matching perfectly with the results of the self-rotation function calculations (Satyamurty et al., 1994). Therefore these two solutions were assumed to represent orientations of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Molecular centres were obtained through calculation of the translation functions in X-PLOR. The highest and (next-highest) peaks in the translation function maps for the two orientations are 5.5s (2.9s) and 3.9s (3.2s), respectively (Table 1). For the relative y separation between the two molecular centres, the translation function had a single large peak of height 15s. The 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry was, however, not imposed during the refinement. Rigid body refinement of the orientation and position of the two molecules converged to an R-factor of 49% ° for data between 8 and 3 A limits. One cycle of simulated annealing (SA) refinement followed by positional refinement with fixed B-factors reduced ° the R-factor to 33.5% for all data upto 2 A. The B-factors were then refined as grouped atom Table 1. Molecular replacement calculations

B-factors, and the R-factor decreased to 27.0%. At this stage the sequence of gelonin became available (Nolan et al., 1993), and it was possible to align it against ricin A sequence. This alignment and the calculated (2Fo - Fc ) map were the guiding factors while changing the model sequence from ricin A to that of gelonin, using the option REPLACE in SAM. The R-factor decreased further to 23.2% for all ° reflections to 2 A resolution after few cycles of SA refinement with initial temperatures of 600°C. PROCHECK program (Laskowski et al., 1993) was run to check for the correctness of the side-chain conformations. The proper rotomers best fitting the electron density were selected from among the rotomer libraries using TOM/FRODO. Addition of water molecules in stages, and further refinement gave a final R-factor of 18.4% for 39,806 reflections for which I/s (I) > 1.0. The present model consists of 3978 protein atoms and 210 water molecules. Quality of the model The amino acid residues of the two gelonin molecules in the asymmetric unit are numbered 1 to 251 and 1001 to 1251, respectively. All amino acid residues except 248 to 251 and 1250 to 1251 could be fitted in the electron density map (Figure 1). The final model consisting of residues 1 to 247 and 1001 to 1249, has good stereochemistry; the r.m.s. deviations from ideal values in bond lengths and bond angles ° are 0.012 A and 2.7°, respectively. More than 90.0% of the residues are inside the most favoured region of the Ramachandran map (Figure 2). The only residues outside are: Asp45, Arg81, Arg1081 and Asp1249. Asp45, which is part of a very flexible loop, and Asp1249, which is near the carboxy terminus, have low electron densities and therefore their conformations are not very well determined. The less favoured conformations of Arg81 and Arg1081 may be due to the fact that these residues, which are in the turns that link b4 and b5 strands of the two molecules have their CO atoms hydrogen bonded to NE2 atoms of Gln79 and Gln1079, respectively. Side-chain conformational disorder was not observed for any

residue. The average of the refined B-factors of all non-hydrogen atoms in the two molecules ° is B = 35 A2, compared to the statistical estimate of ° 29.5 A2 obtained from a Wilson plot. The residueaverage B-factors for the two molecules are very similar. The average error in the atomic co-ordinates, estimated from the variation of R-factor as a function ° of resolution (Luzzati, 1952), is 0.2 A. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit have very similar conformations (Figure 3(a)). The r.m.s. deviation for ° Ca superpositions (247 pairs) is 0.38 A, and the ° corresponding value for all atoms is 1.4 A. The deviation is above average in the loops which connect secondary structure elements, and which are exposed on the surface of the molecule. Molecular structure/conformation Since the conformations of the two molecules are similar, the following description will apply for both molecules, even though residue numbers from 1 to 251 will be used in the description. Structurally, gelonin belongs to the (a + b) class (Levitt & Chothia, 1976; Richardson, 1981) of proteins, the N-terminal half (1 to 100) having predominantly beta secondary structure while the C-terminal half (101 to 247) has predominantly helical structure (Table 2A). Six strands, b1, b4, b5, b6, b7 and b8 form a mixed beta sheet, in which the central four strands are antiparallel, and the two pairs at the two edges are parallel. The topology of this sheet (Richardson, 1981) can be described as +1x, +1, -1, +1, +1x, where x represents a crossover connection between strands. The middle strands are connected by tight beta turns (Table 2B). The strands b2,b3 and b9,b10 form two antiparallel beta ribbons. The helical regions, except for short segments of type 310 (123 to 125 and 237 to 239), are all of the a-helix type, and have the standard geometry (Barlow & Thornton, 1988). Helices aA and aC are part of the crossover connections between the parallel strands of the beta sheet, and are packed against the strands b1 and b7, respectively, through hydrophobic interactions. The remaining helices are mostly contiguous in se-

quence, and are linked by very short bends and turns. Actually single residues (Val164, Phe170 and Lys197) assume non-helical conformations and introduce bends or kinks between aF-aG, aG-aH and aI-aJ. In all the three cases the carbonyl oxygen of the residue preceding the helix discontinuity is hydrogen bonded to some other donor atom from the protein or to a water molecule, thereby disrupting the CO0NH hydrogen bond pattern of an a-helix (Blundell et al., 1983). Seven hydrogen ° bonds shorter than 3.1 A, and a number of hydrophobic interactions hold the helices aA and aD-aH into a cluster, which is packed inside the volume defined by the beta sheet and the two beta ribbons (Figure 3(b)). The contact between the helix cluster and the beta sheet involves residues Val5, Phe7, Ala12, Phe20, Tyr17, Tyr14, Phe51, Leu53, Leu56, Ala64, Glu65, Ile68, Val75, Val76, Tyr78, Gln79, Val80, Arg83, Tyr85, Phe86, Phe87, Leu107, His108, Ile130, Phe181, Gln182, Ile137, Val164, Ile153, Leu157, Leu140, Ile161 and Trp198. The secondary structure elements aI, aJ, b9, b10 and aK have maximum tertiary interactions among themselves, and therefore can be considered to form a

separate domain. Thus in gelonin there are two distinct structural domains, one large and one small: domain 1 consists of residues 3 to 32 and 40 to 187, while domain 2 is composed of residues 33 to 39 and 188 to 247. In addition to the hydrogen bonds within secondary structure elements, there are a number of other hydrogen bonds stabilising the tertiary structure of gelonin. Of the 47 hydrogen bonds of ° length less than 3.0 A, 10 are between residues conserved in all the RIPs for which structures are known. Many of these hydrogen bonds are involved in anchoring the relative positions of helices with respect to the beta sheets that define the outer surface of the molecule. The chain segment (238 to 246) forms main-chain hydrogen bonds to link the two structural domains. In addition, 242CO, 244NH and 246CO atoms hydrogen bond to side-chain atoms 198NE1, 202OG and 206NH1, respectively. Interestingly, Trp198, Ser202 and Arg206 are totally conserved, perhaps signifying the importance of these interactions to the conformation and activity of an RIP. It may be pointed out here that Trp198 is stacked parallel to the guanidyl group of Arg169,

1.8 Å Structure of Gelonin

373 there is no hydrogen bond between 196CO and 200NH. This kink is further stabilised by a well defined water molecule, X442, which forms bridging hydrogen bonds to both 196CO and 200NH. Amino acid residues for which the accessible surface ° area (Lee & Richards, 1971) is less than 20 A2, and which are contiguous in sequence, are assumed to be totally buried, thereby forming the core of the protein. It is interesting that out of a total of 80 such residues, 64 are hydrophobic in nature, and from among these 40 are conserved across all RIPs for which sequences are known. The two cysteine residues, C44 and C50, are linked through a disulphide bond. The intervening residues, 45 to 49, form a loop, which is on the surface of the molecule and is exposed to the solvent. This loop appears to be extremely flexible, with the B-factors being higher than average. Active site From X-ray structures of substrate analogue complexes of ricin A and a-momorcharin, and also from site-directed mutagenesis experiments (Ready et al., 1994), the active site of this class of enzymes has been mapped (Kim & Robertus, 1992; Ren et al., 1994). The corresponding amino acid residues in gelonin, identified by sequence and structural alignments are: Tyr74, Arg169, Gly111, Glu166, Tyr113, and Trp198. These residues are located at the cleft between the two domains in gelonin. There are a number of hydrogen bonding interactions between the residues in the active site (Figure 4). The polar residues Arg169 and Glu166 form two hydrogen bonding interactions between them, one direct and another through the water molecule X319. The NH2 and NZ atoms of Arg169 form two separate hydrogen bonds with the main-chain carbonyl of Asn72. The side-chain of Tyr113, which is another conserved residue in the active site, protrudes across the active site cleft and hydrogen bonds directly with OE1 atom of Glu166 (Table 3). The positions of Tyr113 and Arg169 appear to be further stabilised by stacking interactions with Arg123 and Trp198 residues respectively. Active site water molecules Figure 5 shows omit electron density for three water molecules (X319, X320, X321), that are located inside the active site cavity. These water molecules ° have an average B-factor of 35 A2, which is comparable to the protein average and are held by at least two good hydrogen bonds to protein atoms or to other water molecules (Table 3). Glycosylation From binding experiments to columns on which concanavalin was immobilised, gelonin has been shown to be a glycoprotein with terminal mannose residues (Stirpe et al., 1980). It is known that

which is supposed to be a key residue in catalysis. The hydrophobic stacking interactions of Trp198 with Arg169 and the hydrogen bond between 202OG and 244NH appear to be also responsible for the non-helical conformation of Lys197, causing a kink between aI and aJ at Lys197. As a result

N-glycosylation can occur at ND2 atoms of Asn residues in a sequence of type NXT(S), and in this respect Asn82 and Asn189 are two potential glycosylation sites in gelonin. Difference electron density is found near the ND2 atom of only Asn189 in both gelonin molecules in the asymmetric unit. The exact type of sugar linkage is not yet established for gelonin, and therefore, the present model does not include any sugar atoms. Intradimer interactions The two molecules in the asymmetric unit are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry. This symmetry is also displayed in the interactions between the two molecules (Table 4) especially across exposed surfaces of aA, aH and the 310 helix between residues 237 to 239 (Figure 6). Hydrophobic residues Tyr14, Ile15, Val16 and Pro38 interact with hydrophobic residues Pro1038, Val1026, Tyr1014 and Ile1015 from the second molecule in the dimer. Interactions involving aH and the 310 helix are more polar in character. There are a total of ten ° possible hydrogen bonds of length less than 3.1 A, and these involve side-chain and main-chain atoms from residues Asn22, Arg178, Asn180, Lys237 and Ile240. In addition, there are a few hydrogen bond linkages between the two molecules, which are mediated by well defined solvent molecules.

For the molecular dimer, the corre° sponding accessible area is 18,254.2 A2; a loss of 13.6%, which is of the order seen in other proteins of similar size (Argos, 1988; Janin et al., 1988). Crystal packing The gelonin dimer in the asymmetric unit with co-ordinates (x, y, z) is in direct contact with four other molecules at 1 + x,y,z; x,1 + y,z; 1 - x, - 1/ 2 + y,1 - z; 1 - x,1/2 + y, - z in the crystal. There are ° a total of 130 interatomic distances shorter than 4.0 A, and of these five are hydrogen bonds. The majority of these contacts are across short segments in the loops between aC-b8 and b8-aD. The residues that are involved in these contacts are: Asn82, Asn101, Thr102, Ile103, Tyr148, Pro150, Lys1088, Tyr1095, Glu1096, Lys1100, Asn1101, Thr1102, Ile1103, Lys1104, Thr1105, Pro1114, Gly1118, Glu1119. Many other contacts are mediated through water molecules.

Discussion
The number of amino acid residues in ricin A chain (267) are more than in gelonin (251) or a-momorcharin (247), and the sequence similarity is less than 40%. The overall fold of the three RIPs, however, is very similar (Figure 7). The average r.m.s.d. for Ca superpositions between gelonin and ricin A (232 ° pairs) is 1.2 A and that between gelonin and ° a-momorcharin (238 pairs) is 1.3 A. Interestingly, the largest differences among these RIPs occur in the same region of the polypeptide chain, where the two gelonin molecules in the asymmetric unit also show large differences between them. The extra residues in ricin A are all in loop regions that connect secondary structure elements. The positions of insertions as obtained from structural alignments are slightly different from those obtained from purely sequence alignments. For example, from structural alignment, there is a three-residue insertion in ricin A between Ala90 and Pro91 of gelonin, whereas sequence alignment predicts this insertion to be between Phe87 and Lys88. Similarly, structure

this insertion to be after Asp146. These differences could be significant when selecting a particular residue for chemical modification or conjugation, based simply on sequence alignment. Gelonin, like other RIPs, has glycosidase activity. From chemical modification studies it had been suggested that arginine residues are important for the activity of gelonin (Sreenivasan et al., 1986), and this prediction has been confirmed by the presence of Arg169 at the active site. This Arg169 forms a salt bridge with Glu166, another conserved residue in the active site. Most of the hydrogen bonds in the active site are conserved in all RIP structures determined so far. However there are a few differences caused by changes in sequence in the periphery of the active site. The CO atom of Val73 in gelonin is hydrogen bonded with the OG1 atom of Ser165. This hydrogen bond, present in the structure of ricin A also, is absent in a-momorcharin, as in the latter this Ser is replaced by an Ala. Interestingly, because of this hydrogen bond, the main-chain atoms of residues 73 to 74 deviate from corresponding atoms in a-momor° charin by about 1.2 A (compared to an average of ° in this region of the molecule), and are pulled 0.4 A towards Ser165. The hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr74 in gelonin and ricin A is pointing toward Tyr113 (gelonin numbering), whereas in native a-momorcharin (Ren et al., 1994) and in a mutant ricin A (Kim et al., 1992), these two rings are almost parallel to one another. In both gelonin and ricin A, conformation of Tyr74 is stabilised by a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr74 and the CO oxygen of Gly111 (gelonin numbering). Thus, even though Tyr74 of gelonin is a conserved residue in the active site, its homologous Tyr residues in different RIPs exhibit different side-chain conformations (Figure 8). In contrast, in structures of RIPs complexed to substrate analogues, these two Tyr rings are always almost parallel to each other, stacked on either side of the adenine ring from the substrate analogue. Amino acid residue at position 239 There are conflicting reports as to the amino acid type in gelonin at position 239. While this residue has

been described as Lys in the gene cloning paper (Nolan et al., 1993), it has been described as an Asn in the paper describing conjugation studies (Better et al., 1994). These two residue types are significantly different and can be distinguished easily in a good electron density map. Figure 9 shows a good fit of a Lys residue in the omit electron density for this position in the structure, whereas Asn will not fit the density well. Further, the B-values for all atoms in this residue are below the average value for the protein. These observations establish the sequence at this position to be a Lys rather than an Asn residue. Catalytic mechanism of RIPs The enzymatic reaction of RIPs is the cleavage of the N-glycosidic bond of a specific adenine in 28 S rRNA from the 60 S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. It has been shown that the true substrate is a ribo-oligonucleotide hairpin in which the double helical stem is at least three base-pairs long, and the connecting hairpin loop contains the sequence GAGA, the first adenine being the base that is removed by RIPs (Endo et al., 1987). The removal of adenine is a hydrolysis reaction (Endo & et al., 1987),

and involves addition of a water molecule to the substrate. RIPs are highly specific about the presence of the A base in the tetra loop, and recent crystal structures of complexes of FMP and AMP with ricin A and with a-momorcharin have provided an explanation for this specificity in terms of specific hydrogen bonding interactions between the protein and the adenine moiety. Further, based on these structures, two molecular mechanisms have been suggested (Ren et al., 1994; Monzingo & Robertus, 1992) for the N-glycosidase activity of RIPs. In the two mechanisms, an oxycarbonium ion intermediate is produced, but through different chemical steps. In both mechanisms, a water molecule is required for the nucleophylic attack on the C1' atom of this carbonium ion intermediate. In structures of a-momorcharin and of its three complexes to substrate analogues, two water molecules (OH2 and OH0, of Ren et al., 1994) have been found to occupy identical positions in the active site. Therefore, Ren and co-workers have suggested a catalytic role for either OH2 or OH0 water molecules. In the active site of gelonin there are three water molecules, X319, X320 and X321, and any of these could be the catalytic water. However, the water molecule X319,

which is hydrogen bonded to both Arg169 and Glu166 (Figure 7) superposes onto OH2 to within ° 0.2 A, while X321 superposes onto OH0 to within ° 0.5 A. The water molecule X320 has no counterpart in the structure of momorcharin. Activity of recombinant gelonin There is a variation in the N-glycosidase activity of recombinant gelonin analogues (rGels) in which the natural amino acid at positions 10, 60, 239, 244, 247 or 248 is changed to a Cys. The variation in activity is only marginal for all except for the K239C mutant, where the activity decreases 60-fold (Better et al., 1994). These observations are consistent with the structure of gelonin. The residues at positions 10, 60, 244, 247 and 248 are all located on the outer surface of the molecule, with side-chain atoms projecting away, and therefore not involved in any intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Residue 239, on the

other hand, is quite buried (Figure 9) except for the terminal NZ atom, which is partially exposed. The terminal NZ atom is forming one intramolecular ° hydrogen bond of length 3.2 A with the OH of Tyr228, while the aliphatic carbon atoms of the Lys side-chain are surrounded by hydrophobic residues like Leu194 and Phe172. Replacement of the Cg atom in Lys by a polar Sg atom in Cys might lead to local rearrangement of the structure. Since hydrogen bonds exist between residues 239 to 242 and the C terminus of the helix containing the active site residues Glu166 and Arg169, such conformational rearrangement could perturb the active site geometry, thereby leading to loss of activity. Conjugation of gelonin to antibodies Conjugation between a RIP and an antibody is often used for cell targetting. It has been shown that, when conjugated by disulphide linkage to antibodies

378 against CD4+ cells, the scRIP PAP becomes 1000-fold more effective in inhibiting HIV replication in HIV-infected cells (Zarling et al., 1990). The two cysteines in native gelonin are already disulphide bonded, and therefore native gelonin is not amenable to direct disulphide conjugation. Recombinant gelonin analogues (rGels) in which a single free cysteine residue is located at different positions in the sequence have been produced and then conjugated to different antibodies (Better et al., 1994). The observed variation in the stability of these conjugates against disulphide bond reduction can be rationalised on the basis of how exposed the conjugating residue is in the structure of gelonin. Accessibility calculations show that, from among the different conjugating residues, residue 239 is the least exposed and it forms the most stable conjugate. The activity of the conjugates also is found to depend on the location of the conjugating cysteine. For example, while rGel244Cys , rGel247Cys and rGel248Cys are all equally active, the rGel244 conjugate is relatively inactive (Better et al., 1994). In the structure of gelonin, Lys244 is stacked on top of the invariant Trp198, the distance between Cg244 and a ring carbon of ° Trp198 being 3.9 A. Trp198 itself is stacked on top of the gaunidyl group of the catalytic residue Arg169. Introduction of an S­S linkage at residue 244, is likely to disturb these stacking interactions, thereby leading to altered active site geometry and loss of activity. It is to be expected that in the RIP­antibody conjugate, in addition to the S­S bond, there will be many non-bonded interactions that could influence molecular conformation and active site geometry. Therefore, that site in the RIP sequence is preferable for conjugation, which will allow for both S­S linkage and non-bonded interactions with the antibody, without affecting the active site geometry. In the crystal structure of gelonin, there are extensive interactions between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and yet each active site is very similar to the active sites of other RIPs. Therefore, the region of the gelonin molecule that is involved in dimer formation appears to be a good region for introducing the Cys residue for conjugation. Also, when such a site is chosen, the glyosidase activity is present even in the complex and, therefore, it may not even be necessary for the complex to deconjugate, once inside the cell.

Structure determination and refinement The structure has been solved by the molecular replacement method (Rossmann, 1972), with the X-ray co-ordinates of ricin A-chain (PDB ident code 1RTA) serving as the search model. All crystallographic calculations were carried out using the program package X-PLOR (Brunger et al., 1987) implemented on an i-860 based Landmark computer. Simulated annealing refinement followed the protocol suggested by Brunger (1992). Typically, a cycle of SA refinement consisted of: (1) 50 steps of molecular dynamics integration at each of the temperatures during slow cooling, in decrements of 25 deg. C, from a specified initial temperature to a specified final temperature; (2) 200 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimisation. To save on computer time, the initial temperature was chosen as 2000°C only for the first run of SA refinement, and in all subsequent SA refinements, the initial temperature was 600°C. Thermal parameters were refined during the last stages of refinement, initially as grouped atom temperature factors and only in the final cycle as individual atom temperature factors. Electron density interpretation and model building was done on an IRIS 4D/20 computer graphics work station, with FRODO/TOM (Jones, 1978; Cambillau & Horjales, 1987), and the protein stereochemistry was monitored by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). Water molecules were added manually by examining chemical environments of unaccounted densities in (Fo - Fc ) and (2Fo - Fc ) ° maps, and were assigned B-factors of 30 A2. Calculation of omit maps was preceded by positional refinement of the model from which all residues within a sphere of radius ° 8 A around the residue of interest were not included in structure factor calculation. Structural superpositions using co-ordinates available in the Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) were done using the programme O (Jones et al., 1991). Secondary structure assignments were according to the method of Kabsch & Sanders, 1983). Sequence alignments were done using the programme PALIGN of PCGENE.
