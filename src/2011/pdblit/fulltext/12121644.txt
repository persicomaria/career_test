SUMMARY

DNA-damage signaling utilizes a multitude of posttranslational modifiers as molecular switches to regulate cell-cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. Here we show that RNF8, a FHA/RING domaincontaining protein, plays a critical role in the early DNA-damage response. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of the FHA domain ° structure at 1.35 A. We have shown that RNF8 facilitates the accumulation of checkpoint mediator proteins BRCA1 and 53BP1 to the damaged chromatin, on one hand through the phosphodependent FHA domain-mediated binding of RNF8 to MDC1, on the other hand via its role in ubiquitylating H2AX and possibly other substrates at damage sites. Moreover, RNF8-depleted cells displayed a defective G2/M checkpoint and increased IR sensitivity. Together, our study implicates RNF8 as a novel DNA-damage-responsive protein that integrates protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation signaling and plays a critical role in the cellular response to genotoxic stress.
INTRODUCTION Faithful duplication and segregation of DNA is essential to maintain genomic integrity during cell division. DNA lesions elicit a DNA-damage response, which collectively includes DNA repair, activation of cell-cycle checkpoints, chromatin remodeling, cellular senescence, and apoptosis. Mutations in a variety of components involved in these

cellular processes directly contribute to tumorigenesis (Bartkova et al., 2005; Gorgoulis et al., 2005), highlighting the importance of these damage-induced signaling cascades in tumor suppression. Accumulating evidence suggests that the ATM/ATR-dependent phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX to create g-H2AX is the initial signal for subsequent accumulation of various mediators/repair proteins to DNA lesions (Bassing et al., 2003; Celeste et al., 2003). A positive feedback loop has been proposed in which ATM/ATR concentrates at g-H2AX-containing double-strand breaks via MDC1 to further phosphorylate adjacent H2AX molecules and amplify the DNA-damage signal (Lou et al., 2006; Stucki et al., 2005). Through this signal amplification step, a number of mediator/repair proteins, including BRCA1 and 53BP1, concentrate to sites of DNA damage to facilitate downstream checkpoint activation. We and others have previously demonstrated that tandem BRCT domains serve as phosphopeptide binding motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions (Manke et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003). Specifically, a number of DNA-damage response proteins, including BRCA1 and MDC1 (Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2002; Goldberg et al., 2003; Lou et al., 2003a, 2003b; Stewart et al., 2003), harbor BRCT domains that mediate binding to their respective partners in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Yu and Chen, 2004; Stucki et al., 2005). In addition to tandem BRCT domains, the FHA domain constitutes a separate class of phosphopeptide binding modules (Durocher et al., 2000). Many FHA domain-containing proteins have been reported to play a role in DNA repair, cell-cycle arrest, and pre-mRNA processing (Sun et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000). The reversibility and sequence selectivity of ligand binding afforded by these and other phosphopeptide binding domain-containing proteins allows individual protein-protein interactions that control downstream responses to be tightly regulated in a stimulus-dependent manner.

Recent studies have provided additional insight into the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the DNA-damage signaling network. However, the detailed mechanisms by which the initial g-H2AX signal at DNA lesions becomes propagated, amplified, and modified to concentrate checkpoint mediator proteins to these sites remain obscure. Here we report our study of an FHA and RING domain-containing protein, RNF8, which serves as the molecular linker for communication between the protein phosphorylation and protein ubiquitylation pathways that are crucial for the activation and maintenance of the DNA-damage response. RESULTS RNF8 Is a DNA-Damage-Responsive Protein We have previously studied the role of the FHA domain and RING domain-containing protein Chfr in mitosis (Yu et al., 2005). In the course of these studies we used a protein named RNF8 as a control because it is the only other known mammalian protein that shares a similar domain organization with Chfr (Figure S1A). RNF8 was initially reported to interact with class III human ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) through its RING domain (Ito et al., 2001). RNF8 was later shown to bind to the Retinoid X Receptor and regulate its transcriptional activity (Takano et al., 2004). Because several FHA domain-containing proteins are known to play a role in DNA-damage signaling, we investigated whether RNF8 or Chfr might participate in the DNA-damage response. Cells stably expressing tagged RNF8 or Chfr were irradiated. Interestingly and surprisingly, RNF8 foci can be readily observed after DNA damage, and these foci colocalized with the DNA-damage marker g-H2AX (Figure S1A). Despite the resemblance of RNF8 and Chfr (Figure S1A), we did not observe any Chfr focus formation following DNA damage (Figure 1A), indicating that these two related proteins have distinct cellular functions. To confirm the observed IR-induced focus localization of RNF8, we generated a polyclonal antibody specifically recognizing RNF8 (Figure S1B). IR-induced foci (IRIF) of endogenous RNF8 can be readily visualized (Figure 1B). The fact that RNF8 foci overlap with those of g-H2AX prompted us to speculate that RNF8 might function in the DNA-damage response. We therefore examined the localization of RNF8 with several proteins known to be involved in this damage-induced signaling cascade. As
Figure 1. RNF8 Is Involved in Mammalian DNA-Damage Response

expected, RNF8 colocalizes with MDC1, NBS1, 53BP1, BRCA1, pATM, and MCPH1, further lending credence to the potential role of RNF8 in the DNA-damage response (Figure S1C). The DNA-damage-induced focus formation of checkpoint proteins reflects their localization to chromatin structures at the vicinity of DNA breaks. Indeed, increased amount of RNF8 accumulated in the acid extractable fraction after IR treatment (Figure 1C). Moreover, the less-soluble fraction of RNF8 can be released by nuclease treatment (Figure 1D), suggesting that RNF8 accumulates at the chromatin upon DNA damage. Together, our studies suggest that RNF8 is a novel DNA-damage-responsive protein. RNF8 Acts Downstream of H2AX and MDC1 following DNA Damage It is generally accepted that the phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX is the initial signal upon DNA lesion detection. g-H2AX is required for the sustained localization of a number of DNA-damage mediator/repair factors at chromatin regions at or near the sites of DNA damage (Paull et al., 2000). To delineate where RNF8 fits in the established DNA-damage signaling cascade, we examined IRIF formation of RNF8 in a number of human or mouse cells with deficiencies in various DNA-damage checkpoint proteins. Our anti-RNF8 antibody could not detect endogenous RNF8 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), so we used retroviral particles containing a RNF8 expression construct to infect these cells (Figure 1E). In sharp contrast to the control wild-type (WT) MEFs, no IR-induced RNF8 focus formation was observed in H2AX-deficient MEFs or those reconstituted with the S139A phosphomutant (Figures 1E and S1D). Likewise, RNF8 focus formation was also abrogated in MDC1-deficient cells. On the other hand, RNF8 relocalization to g-H2AX-containing foci is not noticeably affected in cells with BRCA1, 53BP1, or NBS1 deficiency (Figure 1E). These data suggest that RNF8 acts downstream of H2AX and MDC1 in the DNA-damageresponsive pathway. The FHA, but Not Its RING Domain, Targets RNF8 to DNA Breaks The FHA domain is a phosphoprotein-binding module (Durocher et al., 2000; Li et al., 2000). Figure 1F shows that tagged WT RNF8 formed foci that colocalize with g-H2AX following IR treatment. Similarly, foci formation

can also be observed for the delRING mutant. On the other hand, the FHA deletion mutant (i.e., delFHA) failed to localize to g-H2AX-containing foci, suggesting that the FHA domain of RNF8 is important for targeting RNF8 to IR-induced DNA-damage sites (Figure S1E). The FHA Domain of RNF8 Selects Phosphomotifs Similar to Those Recognized by Tandem BRCT Domains FHA domains, like tandem BRCT domains, recognize amino acid sequences extending 3­4 residues around a central phosphorylated amino acid, with selection determined primarily by residues in the third C-terminal (+3) position (Durocher et al., 2000). However, in contrast to BRCT domains that recognize both pSer- and pThrcontaining sequences, FHA domains appear only to recognize pThr-containing motifs. We determined the optimal phosphopeptide motifs recognized by the RNF8 FHA domain using pThr-oriented peptide library screening (Figure 2A). Intriguingly, the RNF8 FHA domain showed strong selection for Tyr and Phe in the +3 position. This selection for aromatic amino acids differs substantially from the acidic and aliphatic residue selection in the +3 position shown by all other FHA domains for which X-ray crystal structures are available (Durocher et al., 2000; Li et al., 2002). Instead, this selection for aromatic amino acids at the +3 position closely resembles the optimal phosphopeptide motifs recognized by the tandem BRCT domains of BRCA1 and MDC1 (Manke et al., 2003; Stucki et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2003). To investigate the structural basis for this unusual motif selection, we used limited proteolysis to map the boundaries of the FHA domain and solved the high-resolution structure of the RNF8 FHA:optimal phosphopeptide com° plex by X-ray crystallography at 1.35 A (Table S1; the PDB code for the RNF8 FHA domain is 2PIE). The global fold of the RNF8 FHA domain is an 11-stranded b sandwich with the phosphopeptide-binding surface comprised of residues in loops that connect the b-strands at one end of the sandwich (Figure 2B), similar to what has been previously observed in the crystal structures of Rad53 and Chk2 FHA domains (Durocher et al., 2000; Li et al., 2002). The bound phosphopeptide is in an extended conformation with extensive contacts between the peptide backbone and side chain and main chain atoms from the RNF8 FHA domain (Figure 2C). Three structural features observed in the RNF8 FHA: phosphopeptide complex are distinct from those in other FHA domains: First, the RNF8 FHA domain contains two divergent loops and a C-terminal a-helical extension that cluster along one face of the domain, well removed from the phosphopeptide-interacting surface (Figure 2B, shaded red). This region is likely involved in phosphoindependent interactions with potential substrates or with additional portions of the full-length RNF8 molecule. Second, the RNF8 FHA domain makes extensive direct contacts to the phosphate group, including a novel bidentate interaction involving Arg61 that is not observed in any

other FHA domain:phosphopeptide crystal structure (Figure 2D). Third, the selectivity for Tyr/Phe in the +3 position results from its interaction with a flat, mostly nonpolar surface relatively enriched in sulfur-containing amino acids (Cys55, Met58, Val110, and Leu112). Interestingly, the general character of the interaction between the +3 Tyr and the surface of the RNF8 FHA domain is strikingly similar to that observed between the +3 Tyr residue of a g-H2AX pSer-containing phosphopeptide and the surface of the tandem BRCT domains of MDC1 critical for MDC1 foci formation (Figures 2E and 2F). On the other hand, the RNF8 FHA domain +3 interacting surface bears little resemblance to the analogous surfaces in other FHA domains (Figures 2G and 2H). Thus, it appears that the pThr-binding FHA domain of RNF8 has evolved to bind to similar motifs as those recognized by the BRCT domains of the foci-forming proteins BRCA1 and MDC1. Phosphopeptide Binding by the FHA Domain Is Required for RNF8 Foci Formation We directly investigated whether phospho-dependent binding was critical for IRIF formation of RNF8. We found that mutation of Arg61 to Gln reduced FHA domain:phosphopeptide binding by over 160-fold (Figures S2A and S2B). When the full-length RNF8 R61Q mutant protein was introduced into cells, no R61Q foci were observed after radiation damage (Figure S2C), indicating that phospho-dependent binding is required for interaction between the RNF8 FHA domain and its upstream binding partner. In an experiment with cell lysates, WT RNF8 could be pulled down with a phospho-Ser-containing peptide derived from g-H2AX (Figure S2D) but not with the control unphosphorylated peptide. This interaction was totally abolished in experiments with the delFHA or R61Q mutant proteins. Furthermore, consistent with the previous observation that Chfr does not form IRIF, Chfr did not bind to the phosphorylated H2AX peptide (Figure S2E). Although RNF8 bound to phospho-H2AX peptides in a pulldown experiment, we failed to detect any direct binding between the RNF8 FHA domain and a phospho-H2AX peptide by isothermal titration calorimetry (data not shown), raising the possibility that the RNF8:g-H2AX interaction observed was indirect. Because the BRCT domains of MDC1 mediate its direct binding to phospho-H2AX, and MDC1 is required for RNF8 IRIF, we examined whether RNF8 interacts with MDC1. Intriguingly, the optimal motif for phosphopeptide binding to the RNF8 FHA domain is pTXXY/F (Figure 2A), and inspection of the MDC1 sequence reveals four potential ATM/ATR phophorylation sites that match this motif (T699QCF, T719QAF, T752QPF, and T765QPF). One of these TQPF sites was recently reported to be phosphorylated following DNA damage in a large-scale proteomic study (Matsuoka et al., 2007). We therefore synthesized peptides containing each of these four putative phosphorylation sites and measured their binding to the RNF8 FHA domain. Three of the four bound with affinities comparable to the optimal peptide

In the RNF8 FHA domain (E), selection for Tyr over Phe in the +3 position likely results from a water-mediated contact between the Tyr hydroxyl and the backbone nitrogen of Leu57.

Thereafter beads were washed three times with NETN, and isolates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blotting with indicated antibodies. (E) RNF8 interacts with MDC1 via its FHA domain. Experiments were conducted similarly to that described in (D) and immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out as indicated. (F) 293T cells were irradiated (10 Gy; 1 Gy = 100 Rads) or left untreated and cell extract (NETN + 500 mM NaCl) was treated with or without lambda phosphatase prior to diluting and incubating with bacterially expressed 10 mg of GST-RNF8 protein for 2 hr at 4 C . The GST-RNF8 complex was separated by SDS-PAGE to evaluate the amount of endogenous MDC1 that bound specifically to RNF8.

(Figures S2F­S2I), while the fourth bound more weakly. We next generated a deletion mutant spanning residues 698­768 (Del) of MDC1 (Figure 3A) and showed that MDC1, but not Del, specifically bound to purified GSTRNF8 (Figures 3B and 3C). In addition, RNF8 coprecipitated with WT but not Del mutant of MDC1 in vivo (Figure 3D), further implying that these putative phosphor-

ylation sites are required for the interaction between RNF8 and MDC1. A control experiment using the delFHA mutant of RNF8 confirms that this interaction also requires the FHA domain of RNF8 (Figure 3E). Similar results were obtained in reciprocal immunoprecipitation assays. Consistent with the role of MDC1 in mediating RNF8 accumulation at DNA-damage sites, an increased amount of

MDC1 bound to RNF8 after IR, and this MDC1 was abolished with prior phosphatase treatment (Figure 3F). Likewise, WT but not Del mutant of MDC1 restored RNF8 IRIF in MDC1-depleted HeLa cells (Figures S3A­S3B). Collectively, these in vitro and in vivo results support a possible direct role of MDC1 in facilitating RNF8 localization, via a phospho-specific interaction conferred by the RNF8 FHA domain, to the chromatin following DNA damage. Both the RNF8 FHA and RING Domains Are Required for BRCA1 and 53BP1 IRIF To further probe the role of RNF8 at DNA-damage sites in vivo, we depleted RNF8 with two different siRNAs and tested whether the IRIF of a number of mediator/repair proteins were RNF8 dependent. RNF8 knockdown did not affect g-H2AX or MDC1 foci formation at DNA-damage sites (Figures 4A and S4A­S4C); however, localization of 53BP1 and BRCA1 to foci was abrogated (Figure 4A), suggesting that RNF8 lies upstream of these DNA-damage signaling mediator/effectors and facilitates the accumulation of these proteins to the sites of DNA damage. The MDC1/RNF8 interaction experiments presented in Figure 3 imply that MDC1 may interact with RNF8 and regulate RNF8-dependent events following DNA damage. MDC1 was previously shown to be required for IRIF formation of these checkpoint mediator proteins (Goldberg et al., 2003; Lou et al., 2003a; Stewart et al., 2003; also see Figure S4D). Here, we examined whether the MDC1/ RNF8 interaction is crucial for these events in vivo. As expected, ectopically expressed MDC1 restored the accumulation of BRCA1 and 53BP1 in response to IR in MDC1À/À MEFs. The MDC1 deletion mutation, which abolishes its interaction with RNF8, did not affect its own focus localization following IR but failed to restore the RNF8-dependent concentration of BRCA1 and 53BP1 at the foci (Figure 4B), suggesting that the MDC1/RNF8 interaction is likely to be required for RNF8-dependent functions following DNA damage. In order to further explore roles of the RNF8 FHA and RING domains in targeting 53BP1 and BRCA1 to foci, we knocked down RNF8 in HeLa cells using siRNF8#2 (Figure S4E) and reintroduced full-length RNF8, delFHA, or delRING using constructs containing silent mutations within the RNF8 coding sequence that rendered the reintroduced constructs resistant to the siRNA. Unlike the deletion mutants, reconstitution with full-length RNF8 restored 53BP1 and BRCA1 IRIF in cells depleted of endogenous RNF8 (Figures 4C and S4F). Thus, both the phosphopeptide-binding and the ubiquitin ligase activity of RNF8 are required for its function in mediating the accumulation of DNA-damage checkpoint proteins at the sites of DNA damage. RNF8 Mediates IR-Induced Damage-Associated Ubiquitin Conjugates Our observation that IRIF formation of BRCA1 and 53BP1 requires the RNF8 RING domain suggests that the accumulation of these checkpoint proteins is dependent on

protein ubiquitylation at the site of the damaged chromatin. The finding that DNA-damage-associated ubiquitin conjugates can be visualized using the anti-ubiquitin FK2 antibody (Morris and Solomon, 2004; Polanowska et al., 2006) is consistent with this hypothesis. If RNF8 is involved in the ubiquitylation of proteins at the damaged chromatin, H2AX and MDC1 deficiencies, which abrogate RNF8 accumulation at IRIF, might be expected to disrupt damage-dependent FK2 focus formation. This is indeed the case (see Figures S5A­S5C). Recently, the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 was also implicated in the ubiquitylation of protein(s) at the chromatin following DNA damage (Zhao et al., 2007). However, the E3 ligase, which provides substrate specificity, has yet to be identified. That RNF8 was demonstrated to interact with UBC13 for substrate ubiquitylation (Plans et al., 2006) prompted us to speculate that RNF8 and UBC13 might act in concert in the DNA-damage-signaling cascade. In support of this speculation, we found that damage-associated ubiquitin conjugates were absent in either RNF8-depleted or UBC13-depleted cells (Figures 5A and S5D). UBC13 depletion also suppressed the accumulation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 at IRIF but did not affect focus formation of phospho-H2AX and MDC1 (Figure S5E). In addition, RNF8 IRIF can be readily visualized in UBC13-depleted cells, indicating that the damage-dependent RNF8 localization precedes UBC13 function in the DNA-damage response. These data, together with previous reports, imply that RNF8 acts with UBC13 to exert a mediator role in the DNA-damage-signaling cascade. RNF8 Mediates Accumulation of the UIMContaining Protein Rap80 at Sites of DNA Breaks The ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM) containing protein Rap80 has recently been shown to relocalize to g-H2AXcontaining foci in a UIM-dependent manner (Kim et al., 2007; Sobhian et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007). We found that Rap80 focus formation was abolished in RNF8depleted and UBC13-depleted cells (Figure 5B), and that its localization requires both the RING and FHA domains of RNF8 (Figures 5C and 5D). Together these results strongly suggest that the ubiquitin conjugates, whose appearance at foci we have shown to be dependent on both RNF8 and UBC13, might serve as a signal for Rap80 accumulation at the sites of DNA damage. RNF8 Is Required for H2AX Ubiquitylation following DNA Damage Because H2AX phosphorylation is essential for sustained accumulation of MDC1 and RNF8, which in turn is required for localization of other checkpoint proteins including the Rap80-BRCA1 complex and 53BP1 at DNA-damage sites, we speculate that H2AX might be ubiquitylated in a RNF8-dependent manner. We first examined whether H2AX can be ubiquitylated in vivo. By overexpressing tagged H2AX and ubiquitin in the cell, we found that some of the tagged H2AX molecules were ubiquitylated (Figure 6A). Moreover, in HeLa cells stably expressing

HA-tagged H2AX, we showed that H2AX ubiquitylation is regulated in an IR-dependent manner in vivo, and that depletion of RNF8 abolishes the IR-induced H2AX ubiquitylation. Because of the pivotal role phosphorylated H2AX plays in the localization of checkpoint proteins at IRIF, we used an antibody against g-H2AX to examine the state of H2AX ubiquitylation specifically in the phosphorylated form. While RNF8 deficiency does not affect IR-induced H2AX phosphorylation, slower migrating bands corresponding to ubiquitylated endogenous g-H2AX species were observed in irradiated cells expressing RNF8 but were compromised in the RNF8 knockdown cells (Figure 6C). While RNF8 is clearly responsible for g-H2AX di-ubiquitylation, RNF8 knockdown also appears to lower

the levels of g-H2AX monoubiquitylation. Downregulation of UBC13 also significantly reduced damage-induced ubiquitylation of g-H2AX (Figure S6C), supporting our hypothesis that RNF8 acts with UBC13 in promoting protein ubiquitylation at or near DNA-damage sites. In control experiments we have shown that our anti-phosphoH2AX antibody specifically recognizes phosphorylated H2AX species following DNA damage (Figures 6D and 6E). Together, these results point to a role for RNF8 in regulating g-H2AX ubiquitylation in response to DNA damage. Because H2AX phosphorylation is critical for RNF8 localization to sites of DNA breaks (Figure S1D), we asked whether H2AX ubiquitylation is similarly compromised in

Figure 7. RNF8 Is Required for G2/M Checkpoint Control and Cell Survival following Ionizing Radiation
(A) IR-induced G2/M checkpoint is defective in cells with RNF8 depletion and requires both the RNF8 FHA and RING domains. A summary of the percentages of cells stained positive with phospho-H3 antibody before and after IR treatment from three individual experiments is shown. Error bars indicate standard deviation. HeLa cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs, and percentages of mitotic cells before and after radiation were determined by FACS analysis as described in Experimental procedures. (B) RNF8-depleted cells display increased radiation sensitivity as determined by colony formation assay. Figure represents value obtained from three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviation. (C) A proposed model of the DNA-damageresponsive pathway involving RNF8. The relocalization of the Rap80-BRCA1 complex and 53BP1 requires RNF8-dependent protein ubiquitylation at the chromatin, whereas the accumulation of NBS1 at DNA-damage sites is independent of RNF8.

cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable S139A H2AX mutant protein. Indeed, only H2AX-deficient MEFs reconstituted with WT H2AX, but not those reconstituted with the H2AX S139A mutant, supported damage-dependent H2AX ubiquitylation (Figure 6E). Similarly, the RNF8dependent H2AX ubiquitylation is also compromised in MDC1-deficient cells (Figure S6A). We also reconstituted H2AXÀ/À cells with H2AX K119/ 120R mutant. While this H2AX mutant abolished the constitutive monoubiquitylation of H2AX, cells expressing this mutant still showed damage-induced formation of ubiquitin conjugates and IR-induced H2AX ubiquitylation (Figures S6D and S6E), suggesting that IR-induced H2AX ubiquitylation is distinct from those constitutively monoubiquitylated H2AX species. To further evaluate whether the chromatin-associated RNF8 phosphopeptide-binding and E3 ligase activities are required for H2AX ubiquitylation in response to IR, RNF8-depleted HeLa cells expressing siRNA-resistant full-length delFHA or delRING versions of RNF8 were examined. As shown in Figure 6F, IR-induced H2AX ubiquitylation required both the FHA and RING domains of RNF8. RNF8 Participates in the G2/M Checkpoint and Loss of RNF8 Renders Cells Sensitive to Ionizing Radiation DNA-damage checkpoints have evolved to maintain genomic stability by preventing cells with damaged DNA from entering mitosis. Because RNF8 enables the accumulation of multiple checkpoint proteins at the sites of DNA breaks, we tested the effect of RNF8 in IR-induced cell-cycle arrest. While cells transfected with control

siRNA displayed normal checkpoint activation, RNF8depleted cells, like those depleted of BRCA1, failed to properly arrest at the G2/M checkpoint upon IR (Figures 7A and S7A). Moreover, restoration of the G2/M checkpoint required reintroduction of full-length RNF8 in RNF8-depleted cells (Figures 7B and S7B). Finally, depletion of RNF8 also resulted in a notable increase in IR sensitivity (Figures 7B and S7C), further supporting a role of RNF8 in cellular response to DNA damage. DISCUSSION In this study, we have uncovered a novel role of RNF8 in the DNA-damage response. Our data strongly suggest that RNF8 channels the initial phosphorylation-dependent marks at DNA lesions to promote the accumulation of multiple checkpoint proteins, including Rap80, BRCA1, and 53BP1, which, in turn, contribute to RNF8's putative role in maintaining genome integrity. As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF8 promotes protein ubiquitylation at sites of DNA breaks. In eukaryotic cells where DNA is tightly packed, the chromatin structure impedes many of the activities that require access to the genetic materials. Despite our understanding of the roles of H2AX phosphorylation in the DNA-damage response, it has only become evident recently that chromatin remodeling and other histone modifications also play important functions in this cellular process. Specifically, a role of the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complexes, such as the INO80, SWR1, RSC, and SWI/SNF, and histone acetyltransferase complexes including the Trrap-Tip60 complex have been implicated in DNA repair (Murr et al., 2006; Tsukuda et al.,

Cell 131, 901­914, November 30, 2007 ª2007 Elsevier Inc. 911

2005). However, unlike those catalyzed by the Trrap-Tip60 complex, the impaired loading of DNA checkpoint proteins observed in RNF8-depleted cells could not be counteracted by preincubation with sodium butyrate, chloroquine, or hypotonic solution (unpublished data). We hypothesize that RNF8 may be required for the accumulation of checkpoint/repair proteins via a different mechanism, i.e., ubiquitylating proteins at the sites of DNA breaks. Indeed, RNF8 is pivotal for the accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates at the damaged chromatin, which depended on its FHA and RING domains. In support of the role of RNF8 in protein ubiquitylation at sites of DNA breaks, we show that the phosphorylation-dependent RNF8 accumulation at g-H2AX sites is responsible for the IR-induced H2AX di-ubiquitylation. The E3 ligase complex BRCA1-BARD1 has also been shown to catalyze ubiquitin polymers at the damaged chromatin (Morris and Solomon, 2004; Polanowska et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006). However, unlike RNF8 and UBC13, BRCA1 depletion did not compromise the IR-induced H2AX ubiquitylation (Figure S6B), suggesting that BRCA1 accumulates at the sites of DNA breaks subsequent to the RNF8/UBC13dependent H2AX ubiquitylation following DNA damage. Finally, we found that ubiquitylation events catalyzed by RNF8 are independent of H2AX K119 and K120, illustrating that damage-induced H2AX ubiquitination is RNF8 dependent but distinct from the constitutive monoubiquitylation of H2AX (Figures S6D and S6E). A scenario is now emerging in which ubiquitination serves as a posttranslational modifier in the DNA-damage-dependent signaling cascade (Huang and D'Andrea, 2006). Recent studies suggest a role of histone ubiquitination as a means to remodel the chromatin in order to facilitate the accumulation of DNA repair protein (Kapetanaki et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006). In addition, monoubiquitylation of a number of proteins has been demonstrated to be responsible for protein-protein interactions (GarciaHiguera et al., 2001; Matsushita et al., 2005; Pavri et al., 2006; Stelter and Ulrich, 2003; Taniguchi et al., 2002). Multiple ubiquitin moieties covalently attached via lysine 63 have also been reported to regulate and promote the accumulation of proteins involved in DNA repair (Hoege et al., 2002; Hofmann and Pickart, 1999). More recently, the UIM-containing protein Rap80 was discovered to play a role in the BRCA1-dependent DNA-damage response, serving as an adaptor for BRCA1 accumulation at sites of DNA breaks (Kim et al., 2007; Sobhian et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007). Our observation that RNF8 mediates both the IRIF of conjugated ubiquitin and Rap80 at sites of DNA breaks implies that Rap80 might associate with the damaged chromatin by tethering to certain FK2reacting ubiquitylated protein(s). The fact that the IRinduced H2AX ubiquitylation is similarly compromised in RNF8-depleted cells implicates H2AX as an RNF8 substrate. In the accompanying paper, in addition to H2AX, H2A has also been shown to be a substrate of RNF8 (Mailand et al., 2007). Together these studies support a model that ubiquitin chains on H2A, H2AX, and probably other

RNF8 substrates might serve as important docking sites during the transduction of the DNA-damage signal. While the UIM-containing protein RAP80 is required for BRCA1 localization, RAP80 is dispensable for 53BP1 localization. It would be interesting to test whether any additional ubiquitin-binding protein would serve to tether 53BP1 to DNA-damage sites via damage-associated ubiquitin conjugates. Given the role of histone ubiquitylation in chromatin remodeling, it is also plausible that the RNF8-dependent ubiquitylation events at the vicinity of DNA breaks may enhance the accessibility of 53BP1 to modified histones (Huyen et al., 2004; Sanders et al., 2004; Botuyan et al., 2006). In any case, based on the requirement of the RNF8 RING domain, we propose that RNF8 facilitates the transduction of the initial phosphorylation-dependent DNA lesion signal by regulating H2A/ H2AX ubiquitylation, and possibly other substrates, and thus controlling the localization of the Rap80-BRCA1 complex and other checkpoint proteins. In summary, our study implies a critical role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in supporting genome integrity by licensing the assembly of multiple checkpoint/DNA repair proteins at DNA lesions. The link between protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation revealed in this study highlights the importance of posttranslational modifiers as molecular switches that govern, among many cellular processes, the DNA-damage response pathway in a stimulus-inducible manner. RNF8 is a key player involved in the crosstalk between different protein modifications, with its FHA domain required for its localization to DNAdamage foci through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction and its E3 ligase catalytic domain required for the further accumulation of Rap80, BRCA1, and 53BP1 (Figure 7F). The interplay between these two protein modification cascades may play an essential role in ensuring the proper execution of cellular response to DNA damage.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Antibodies The RNF8 polyclonal antibody was raised against a GST-RNF8 fusion protein and was affinity purified using an MBP-RNF8 column. Antibodies against the myc epitope, H2AX, g-H2AX, BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1, were previously described (Lou et al., 2003b; Yu et al., 2006). The anti-H3, anti-FK2, and anti-ORC2 antibodies were obtained from Upstate Cell Signaling. Anti-pATM (Ser1981), anti-GAPDH, antiHA, and anti-UBC13 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, Chemicon, Covance, and Anaspec, respectively. Anti-actin and antiFlag (M2) were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfection 293T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 5% bovine serum and 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 C. Cell transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocol. Immunostaining Procedure To visualize IRIF, cells cultured on coverslips were treated with 10 Gy IR (1 Gy = 100 Rads) followed by recovery for 6 hr. Cells were then washed with PBS, incubated in 3% paraformaldehyde for 12 min,

912 Cell 131, 901­914, November 30, 2007 ª2007 Elsevier Inc.

and permeabilized in 0.5% triton solution for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated with primary antibody for 60 min. Samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibody for 60 min. Cells were then stained with DAPI to visualize nuclear DNA. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with anti-fade solution and visualized using a Nikon ECLIPSE E800 fluorescence microscope. IR Sensitivity, G2/M Checkpoint Assays, and Chromatin Fractionation IR sensitivity and G2/M checkpoint assays were performed as described previously (Lou et al., 2003b). Preparation of chromatin fractions were described previously with modifications (Yu et al., 2006). Briefly, cells were harvested at indicated times after treatment and washed once with PBS. Cell pellets were subsequently resuspended in low-salt permeabilization buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 0.05% NP-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, nuclei were recovered and resuspended in 0.2M HCl. The soluble fraction was neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 for further analysis. For microccocal nuclease (MNase) treatment, nuclei recovered after low-salt extraction was washed and resuspended in nuclease reaction buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2). Ten units of nuclease was added and incubated for 30 min on ice. Thereafter, the insoluble fraction was treated essentially as above to isolate the chromatin-bound proteins.
