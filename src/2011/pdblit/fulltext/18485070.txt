Introduction
Monitoring and adapting to changes in environmental conditions are critical for the survival of bacteria in nature and influence the ability of pathogenic bacteria to successfully colonize a host. Soil bacteria such as the Grampositive organism Bacillus subtilis are faced with rapid changes in oxygen tension. Unlike strictly anaerobic or strictly aerobic bacteria B. subtilis, which is a facultative anaerobe, copes with changes in oxygen levels by sensing oxygen concentration and shifting cellular metabolism accordingly (Winstedt and von Wachenfeldt, 2000; Nakano and Zuber, 2002; von Wachenfeldt and Hederstedt, 2002). Bacteria sense oxygen levels by direct and indirect mechanisms. Direct sensing involves regulators that directly bind oxygen or are altered by oxidation state. Indirect sensing can be achieved by monitoring the build-up of metabolites or altered redox states of specific components as a result of changes in cellular homeostasis. Examples of both types of regulators have been well documented in Escherichia coli. For example the global oxygen-responsive regulator Fnr is a direct sensor regulated by an oxygen reactive Fe-S cluster (Kiley and Beinert, 2003) and the ArcA-ArcB two-component system is an indirect sensor that responds to the redox state of the quinone pool (Georgellis et al., 2001). In contrast, the mechanisms that underlie control of gene expression in response to oxygen limitation in B. subtilis are not fully understood. The ResD-ResE two-component system positively regulates several genes involved in aerobic (ctaA) and anaerobic respiration (nasDEF and fnr) (Nakano and Zuber, 2002). In addition, ResDE highly enhances expression of the flavohemoglobin gene hmp (Nakano, 2002; Rogstam et al., 2007). It is not known what signal is perceived by the ResE membrane bound sensor kinase, but is has been speculated that it could be the redox state of menaquinone (Geng et al., 2007). Fnr of B. subtilis is a direct oxygen sensor that positively controls expression of the narGHJI operon encoding nitrate reductase, the narK-fnr operon encoding a putative nitrate/nitrite transporter and Fnr itself, and

Summary
The transcription factor Rex has been implicated in regulation of the expression of genes important for fermentative growth and for growth under conditions of low oxygen tension in several Gram-positive bacteria. Rex senses the redox poise of the cell through changes in the NADH/NAD+ ratio. The crystal structures of two essentially identical Rex proteins, from Thermus aquaticus and T. thermophilus, have previously been determined in complex with NADH. Here we present the crystal structure of the Rex protein from Bacillus subtilis, as well as extensive studies of its affinity for nucleotides and DNA, using surface plasmon resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We show that Rex has a very high affinity for NADH but that its affinity for NAD+ is 20 000 times lower. However, the NAD+ affinity is increased by a factor of 30 upon DNA binding, suggesting that there is a positive allosteric coupling between DNA binding and NAD+ binding. The crystal structures of two pseudoapo forms (from crystals soaked with NADH and cocrystallized with ATP) show a very different conformation from the previously determined Rex:NADH complexes, in which the N-terminal domains are splayed away from the dimer core. A mechanism is proposed whereby conformational changes in a C-terminal domain-swapped helix mediate the transi-

arfM, which encodes an anaerobic respiration and fermentation modulator protein (Reents et al., 2006). In B. subtilis, a novel type of regulator that indirectly responds to changes in oxygen availability is present. This regulator, the Rex (redox) repressor, controls expression of the respiratory oxidase cytochrome bd (cydABCD), the NADH-linked fermentative lactate dehydrogenase (lctP-ldh), a type II NADH dehydrogenase (yjlC-ndh) and a putative nitrite transporter (ywcJ) (Larsson et al., 2005; Gyan et al., 2006). Rex was first discovered in Streptomyces coelicolor and appears to be widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria, but is also found in some bacteria outside this group (Brekasis and Paget, 2003). Work on S. coelicolor Rex has indicated that it directly senses changes in the cytoplasmic ratio of NADH to NAD+. Under oxic conditions, when the cellular NADH/NAD+ ratio is low, Rex represses transcription of its target genes (cydABC, nuoA-D and rexhemACD) but dissociates from its operator sites when the NADH/NAD+ ratio is increased (Brekasis and Paget, 2003). In B. subtilis, transcription of the Rex-repressed genes is activated when oxygen is limiting for aerobic respiration, and as a consequence the levels of free NADH increase. This leads to production of the highoxygen-affinity terminal oxidase cytochrome bd, which ensures efficient oxygen usage, and lactate dehydrogenase, which recycles the excess of NADH (Winstedt et al., 1998; Larsson et al., 2005). The crystal structures of Rex from Thermus aquaticus (T-Rex; Sickmier et al., 2005) and Thermus thermophilus HB8 (Nakamura et al., 2007), both in complex with NADH, have been determined. Rex is composed of two structural domains: an N-terminal domain that adopts a winged helix­turn­helix fold and which most likely is the part that interacts with DNA, and a C-terminal NADH binding Rossmann fold domain. Rex is a homodimer stabilized by swapping of the C-terminal a-helices. In both NADH complexes the two N-terminal domains pack close to each other in a compact dimer. This conformation of Rex is unable to bind DNA. Several possible mechanisms whereby NADH/NAD+ exchange could affect DNA affinity were proposed, one of which involved conformational change of the C-terminal a-helix affecting the orientation of the DNA binding domain (Sickmier et al., 2005). Here we investigate the DNA and ligand binding properties of B. subtilis Rex (B-Rex) and show that it binds NADH with 20 000-fold higher affinity than NAD+. The crystal structures of B-Rex in complex with NADH (soaked into apo crystals) and in complex with ATP (from cocrystallization) are presented. The structure of the apo form was also determined but with poorer quality. Comparisons with the T-Rex (Rex+NADH) structure reveal significant relative movements between the nucleotide binding domain and the DNA binding domain. A mechanism for

Results
Purification of Rex Bacillus subtilis Rex was produced in E. coli and purified to homogeneity using a three-step chromatography protocol. Purified Rex migrated in SDS-PAGE as a ~26 kDa band. MALDI mass spectrometry analysis of the isolated protein yielded a mass of 24 094 Da, which corresponds well to the predicted mass (24 090 Da) of Rex including the initiator methionine residue (data not shown). The oligomeric state of purified Rex was investigated with gel filtration. Rex eluted at volumes corresponding to a molecular mass of about 50 kDa, indicating that it purifies as a homodimer. Rex binds with high affinity to predicted binding sites of rex regulon promoters The inferred minimal Rex binding site is a 20 bp palindromic sequence. Rex binding sites have been found in the promoters of the ywcJ, yjlCD, cydABCD and ldh-lctP operons (Schau et al., 2004; Larsson et al., 2005). A single site is present upstream of ywcJ and yjlCD, two sites are found preceding ldh-lctP and three binding sites are present in the cydABCD promoter region (Fig. 1). To determine the minimal sequence required for optimal recognition by Rex in vitro, we performed electrophoretic

mobility shift assays (EMSA) using a series of oligonucleotides of various lengths (24-, 26-, 28- and 30-mers) corresponding to the ldh2 binding site. Rex was found to bind with lower affinity to the two shortest oligonucleotides. Increasing the length of the oligonucleotides above 28-mers did not enhance DNA binding (data not shown). Binding of purified Rex to 28-mers corresponding to the different operators was analysed with EMSA. The results show that Rex binds with high affinity (Kd in the nanomolar range) to the operator sequences (Fig. 2). The Kd of Rex for the different operators increased in the following order: ywcJ, ldh2, yjlC, cyd1, cyd2, ldh1, cyd3 (Fig. 2). When an invariant nucleotide in either of the half-sites in the ldh2 binding site was exchanged, the binding of Rex was reduced more than 500-fold, suggesting that both arms of the palindromic recognition sequence are involved in Rex-

DNA contacts (Fig. 3A). A sequence bearing some resemblance to a Rex binding site is present in the aslSD promoter region (Larsson et al., 2005). However, the apparent binding affinity of Rex to this site in vitro is very low, as determined using EMSA (Fig. 3B). When one base was exchanged in the binding sequence such that it matched the Rex consensus sequence the binding of Rex increased more than 20-fold (Fig. 3B). Effect of nucleotides on Rex­DNA interactions The binding of Rex to DNA in the absence or presence of different nucleotides was analysed with surface plasmon resonance technology. Biotinylated ldh2 DNA was bound to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. The Rex/DNA interaction was then monitored while flowing Rex over the

very tightly to DNA with a low dissociation rate in the absence of nucleotides or in the presence of NAD+ or ATP, while in the presence of NADH it dissociates about a hundred times faster (Fig. 4 and Table S1). It is also clear that in the presence of NAD+ the dissociation rate is a little slower than for the apo protein. Rex discriminates strongly between NADH and NAD+ Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to obtain a precise measure of the binding affinities of different nucleotides for Rex. A solution of 10 mM Rex was titrated with a nucleotide solution (NADH, NAD+, NADPH, ATP or ADP). Examples of raw data and fitted isotherms for three of the nucleotides (NADH, NAD+ and ATP) are shown in Fig. 5. It is possible to fit the data for all nucleotides with a one-site model, and association constants and binding enthalpies are given as weighted averages in Table S2. Among the different nucleotides tested only NADH binds with high affinity (Ka = 4.1 ¥ 107 0.5 ¥ 107 M-1). The strongest binder of the other nucleotides (ATP) binds to Rex with more than a thousand-fold lower affinity. Notably ATP binds approximately 10 times tighter than NAD+. The binding affinity of different DNA oligonucleotides to Rex was determined by injecting a 160 mM Rex solution into a 5 mM oligonucleotide solution (Fig. 5D). The fitted binding parameters show that Rex binds to the different oligonucleotides with a dissociation constant of approximately 100 nM, in the same range as determined by EMSA and similar to the affinity for NADH. It should be pointed out that as the DH for the binding reaction is rather small for most of the oligonucleotides studied, it is difficult to get a very accurate determination of the binding affinity, so it can only be said that the value is 100 nM or lower.

immobilized DNA. This resulted in a very rapid rise in signal intensity, indicating that Rex was binding to the DNA-coated surface. Due to very fast binding and nonideal association curves it was not possible to obtain estimates of the association rate constants. However, the dissociation rate constants (koff) can be estimated by fitting a biexponential decay function to the dissociation data. Fits to single experiments for each of the tested conditions are shown in Fig. 4. For the apo state of Rex (i.e. as isolated) and the nucleotide complexes formed in the presence of 1 mM NAD+ or 1 mM ATP, the dissociation of Rex from DNA is dominated by one population (about 95%) which dissociates very slowly (koff ~10-6 s-1), while for Rex in the presence of 50 mM NADH the fitting gives two populations of 24% and 75%, both with koff values in the 10-4 s-1 range. The results clearly show that Rex binds

Fig. 6. Overall crystal structure of the B-Rex dimer with ATP bound. The view is perpendicular to the approximate twofold symmetry axis of the C-terminal domains. The A and B monomers are coloured gold and grey respectively. The presumed DNA binding helices, denoted a3, are highlighted in red. The bound ATP molecules are shown as stick models. The conformation of the observed ADP moiety (grey stick models) of NADH in crystals of B-Rex soaked with NADH is superimposed on the ATP molecules. Inserted is the structure of the closed form of T-Rex (PDB code 1DT5) with NTDs packed under the CTD dimer core, for comparison.

ATP between apo Rex and the Rex and DNA complex (Fig. 5E). The three-dimensional structure of Rex Rex from B. subtilis (B-Rex) is a dimer in which each monomer consists of two distinct domains connected by a five-residue linker: a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 86­215) with a characteristic Rossmann fold (Lesk, 1995) and an N-terminal DNA binding domain (NTD, residues 1­85) belonging to the winged helix family (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000; Fig. 6). The NTDs are formed by four a-helices, a1­4, where a3 has been found to bind to the major groove of DNA in other winged helix transcription factors (Gajiwala and Burley, 2000). In this paper we present three very similar crystal structures: the apo form and complexes with ATP and NADH. The ATP complex was obtained by cocrystallization while the NADH complex was produced by soaking apo crystals with NADH. All the structures superimpose very well, having the same crystal packing, overall fold and domain arrangement. However, a region forming a small lid on top of the purine-ribose binding site is well determined in the NADH and ATP complexes but not in the apo structure, indicating a stabilizing effect of ligand binding (Fig. 6). We will refer to the NADH and ATP complexes as `pseudo-apo' forms. The structures are well defined except for 35­37 residues per dimer, in loop regions and at the termini. In monomer A residues in the linker between the C-

and N-terminal domains (84­86) are missing, residues 61­65 within the N-terminal domain, 105­110 within the C-terminal domain in a loop adjoining the b-sheet, and residues 1­10 and 210­215 at the termini. Monomer B seems to be less flexible, possibly because of crystal contact stabilization, and is only missing residues at the termini in the ATP form. The structural organization of B-Rex is very similar to that of the related proteins from T. aquaticus (T-Rex; PDB code 1XCB; Sickmier et al., 2005) and T. thermophilus (Tt-Rex; PDB code 2DT5; Nakamura et al., 2007). As these latter structures are identical in sequence and almost identical in structure we will refer to them both as T-Rex. B-Rex has 34% sequence identity to T-Rex. The dimer core consists of the two tightly packed C-terminal domains. However, while the T-Rex:NADH complex displays a compact, symmetric dimer with the N-terminal domains packed under the C-terminal dimer (Fig. 6), the apo and pseudo-apo forms of B-Rex presented here have an asymmetric dimer in which the two N-terminal domains are splayed out, away from the dimer core, in two different manners (Fig. 6). In this position the DNA recognition helices (a3) point away from the expected DNA binding region under the C-terminal domain, instead forming crystal contacts. The N-terminal domains cannot bind DNA in this conformation. Interestingly, this also suggests that the N-terminal domains are free to move with respect to the dimer core in the absence of NADH. In this conformation B-Rex has overall dimensions of 95 ¥ 45 ¥ 30 Å,

compared with 60 ¥ 50 ¥ 30 Å for T-Rex:NADH. We will refer to the latter as the closed form of Rex. The buried surface area in the dimer also differs, e.g. 1795 Å2 for B-Rex:ATP compared with 2998 Å2 for T-Rex:NADH, as measured by the PISA server (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007), of which domain swapping counts for as much as 77% in B-Rex. PISA moreover identifies 47 residues as constituting the subunit interface in B-Rex:ATP, versus 79 in T-Rex/NADH. These differences reflect the movement of the N-terminal domains away from the dimer interface towards the periphery of the molecule. The phosphate groups of ATP and NADH in B-Rex are oriented out towards the solution, in contrast to T-Rex:NADH, where the diphosphate moiety of NADH curves inwards towards the dimer axis and the nicotinamide binding pocket (Figs 6 and 7). Interestingly, it was only possible to model the ADP part of NADH into the electron density maps in B-Rex. We presume that the rest of the molecule is oriented into solution and disordered. This indicates that the nicotinamide binding pocket in this crystal form is locked in a conformation which is not conducive to NADH binding. It was also observed with only half occupancy in monomer B, whereas the NADH binding site in monomer A was fully occupied. We assume that NADH is still intact and not degraded into ADP during the long soak. If NADH were degraded and the nicotinamide pocket in a conformation competent to bind the nicotinamide moiety we would expect to see some limited electron density there, but this is not observed. In both T-Rex and B-Rex the domain-swapped C-terminal helix (residues 194­207 in B-Rex) lies across the bottom of the b-sheet of the opposite C-terminal domain, making a network of hydrophobic interactions with residues on the lower face of the b-sheet (Fig. 6). This is followed by a more flexible loop (residues 208­ 215). A three-amino acid linker (residues 192­194) joins the domain-swapped helix to the last strand of its own b-sheet. The linker region is involved in NADH binding as the main-chain carbonyl group of Val187 (T-Rex) makes a hydrogen bond to the nicotinamide group of NADH (Fig. 8C). The environment of the domain swapping helix, which has the sequence 189FLAGLTRLSFAIL201 (T-Rex), is largely hydrophobic and the helix makes two interfaces towards the opposite monomer, one towards the b-sheet and opposite towards a-helix 1 of the N-terminal DNA binding domain. Only three of the 13 residues have a polar side-chain, of which two make H-bonding interactions, Ser197 and Arg195, corresponding to residue Val202 and Ser200, respectively, in B-Rex. In the apo and pseudo-apo forms of B-Rex the linker has moved up into the NADH binding pocket (Fig. 8C) and aromatic side-chains [Phe176 in Fig. 8C and Tyr103 (not shown) in monomers A] are projected into the space occupied by the nicotinamide ring in T-Rex:NADH. These and

several related conformational changes sterically block the binding of NADH. Conversely we expect that the linker would be shifted downwards as a result of binding of NADH to B-Rex. The shift in the linker is the beginning of a hinge movement in the domain-swapped helix that shifts it by about 5 Å (Fig. 8A). In T-Rex:NADH the angle between the axis of the domain-swapped helix and the b-strands of the opposite monomer is about 12°. In B-Rex this angle increases slightly to around 17°, but residues on the upper face of the helix (194LAVELQSLVYFLK206; residues underlined) still interact with hydrophobic partners on the lower side of the b-sheet. However, in B-Rex the residues on the opposite side of the helix face the solvent and not the N-terminal domains, as the latter are splayed out.

The nicotinamide moiety of NADH hydrogen-bonds to the linker region between the C-terminal domain-swapping helix and the rest of the C domain. Three different positions found for the N-terminal domain show the closed and two open forms of the repressor. The two different open forms, for monomer A and monomer B, in B-Rex support the proposed conformational flexibility in this form. B. Illustration of the changes induced by NADH binding, affecting the possible orientations of the N-terminal domain of the opposite monomer. The colour scheme is as in (A). The DNA binding helix of the N-terminal domain of T-Rex is shown in dark blue. C. Details of the nicotinamide binding site by comparison of B-Rex monomers A and T-Rex. In B-Rex the linker has moved up into the binding pocket and side-chains, including Phe176(A), have moved in to fill the space occupied by NADH in T-Rex. This filling in B-Rex is asymmetrical in monomer A and B where Tyr103 from the A monomer is has turned to fill the space (not shown). Tyr103B shows the location of this residue with respect to the NADH binding site of the opposite domain.

Most importantly, due to the 5 Å shift of the domainswapped helix its C-terminal end in B-Rex now blocks the path that the linker between N- and C-terminal domains would take if the former were to pack under the latter as in the closed NADH form. The N-C linker is forced away from the core, which may make it highly mobile in solution (Fig. 8B). In monomer B of B-Rex the linker assumes an a-helical conformation, extending helix a4 of the N-terminal domain by one turn, while in monomer A the linker is disordered.

Discussion
The published crystal structures of Rex:NADH from T. aquaticus (Sickmier et al., 2005) and T. thermophilus

(Nakamura et al., 2007) showed that NADH binds in a bipartite pocket with separate areas for the ADP and nicotinamide moieties. The latter binds in a hydrophobic pocket deep within the protein and close to the dimer interface. The amide moiety hydrogen bonds to the linker between the C-terminal domain and the domain-swapped helix. Our biochemical data on Rex from B. subtilis clearly demonstrate a high affinity for NADH (24 nM) while the affinity for NAD+ is 20 000 times lower (0.49 mM), in fact slightly less than that for ATP (0.07 mM). This indicates that binding of the positively charged, planar nicotinamide group of NAD+ to the hydrophobic pocket is disfavoured, as NAD+ binding is essentially indistinguishable from that for ATP, which lacks the nicotinamide moiety entirely. Interestingly the NAD+ affinity is increased by a factor of

about 30 when Rex is bound to DNA, while the affinity for ATP is unaffected, indicating that DNA binding causes some remodelling of the nicotinamide-binding pocket. The N-terminal domains in the apo and pseudo-apo forms of B-Rex are splayed away asymmetrically from the C-terminal dimer core and seem to be strongly affected by interactions to the environment in the crystal rather than assuming a dimer conformation preformed for binding to the palindromic operator sequence, as might have been expected. In the asymmetrical AB dimer the recognition helices are 86­94 Å apart. This further indicates structural malleability in B-Rex in the absence of NADH. We have investigated whether symmetrical AA or BB dimers modelled from the conformations in the crystal would have recognition helices correctly placed to bind DNA by a mostly lock-and-key mechanism, but the distances are 82 and 96 Å respectively. The fact that ATP binding to Rex does not induce a conformational change in the N-terminal domains demonstrates that the binding of the purine-ribose part of NADH is not involved in the transition from an open to a closed form. Soaking crystals with NADH shows that NADH can bind to the protein in this crystal form, but only in the upper part of the binding pocket, similarly to ATP. The fixation of the N-terminal domain positions by crystal contacts forces the C-terminal domain swapped helix and the linker joining it to the C-terminal core into a conformation which sterically blocks the binding of NADH. However, both ATP and NADH binding result in the ordering of a well-defined hairpin motif with adjoining loops, forming a lid locking the ADP moiety on top of the b-sheet of each C-domain. The apo structure shows disorder of approximately 30 residues per monomer (residues 118­146; B-Rex numbering) in the corresponding area (Fig. 6), contributing strongly to the poor refinement statistics for this structure (Table S3). Mechanism of inhibition of DNA binding by NADH The structures presented here strongly implicate the domain-swapped helix of Rex in communication of NADH binding to the DNA binding domain. In the apo and pseudo-apo forms the helix shifts by approximately 5 Å across the face of the opposite b-sheet, towards its N-terminal side, compared with T-Rex:NADH. In both monomers this sterically blocks the path of the linker between the N- and C-terminal domains, which presumably renders it very flexible. Taken in combination with the biochemical evidence that NAD+ binds 20 000 times less strongly than NADH to B-Rex, we propose that DNA binding by B-Rex mainly relies on an equilibrium between a highly flexible apo form and a locked NADH form. The C-terminal helix may have two or more stable orientations with respect to the bottom face of the opposite b-sheet. In the apo conformation the linker between the N- and

C-terminal domains is most likely mobile and the correct conformation of the latter for DNA binding can be selected at least partly by induced fit. In the crystal form observed here, crystal packing effects have selected two different stable orientations of the N-terminal domains. Upon increasing NADH concentration in response to the redox poise of the cell, NADH will bind to Rex, affecting the conformation of the linker to the C-terminal domain swapped helix and shifting the helix with respect to the b-sheet. The far end of this helix will now no longer block the path of the N­C domain linker and the NTD becomes locked into the presumably very stable closed conformation under the CTD, where a complementary hydrophobic binding surface for the first helix of the N-terminal domain is created by the orientation of the domain-swapped helix seen in the NADH-bound crystal structures. This conformation cannot bind DNA (Sickmier et al., 2005; Fig. 8A). The positive allosteric effect of DNA binding on the affinity for NAD+ suggests that DNA binding causes conformational changes in the nicotinamide binding pocket. On the contrary, there is a negative allosteric effect between DNA and NADH binding. This is seen as a faster dissociation of Rex from DNA when the concentration of NADH is increased. This indicates that the conformational change caused by DNA binding makes the nicotinamide binding pocket less optimal for binding NADH. These results suggest that binding of NAD+ to the Rex:DNA complex is an intermediate step in the dissociation mechanism in response to NADH. A suggested binding mechanism based on the structural and biochemical data is shown in Fig. 9. The proposed conformational change requires nonspecific interactions between the domain-swapped helix and the b-sheet. The crystal structures of all three Rex proteins show that the interface is almost entirely hydrophobic, giving a `slippery' surface conducive to structural mobility. It cannot be completely excluded that the two packings of the helix against the b-sheet are the result of species variation, but we consider this unlikely. First the critical hydrophobic residues Phe189, Leu193 and Leu196 (T-Rex numbering) are conserved or conservatively substituted in all known Rex species (currently > 100). The same is true for the interacting residues on the b-sheet. Thus the two helix packings against the b-sheet appear to be a mechanistic feature and energetically favourable within a Rex protein from a given species.

Structure and function of Bacillus subtilis Rex 475

Expression and purification of Rex
Escherichia coli TUNER (DE3) cells carrying the pET101-rex expression plasmid were grown in 2 l, TB media (2 ¥ 1 l in 5 l baffled E-flasks; Sambrook and Russel, 2001) containing carbenicillin at 100 mg ml-1. The bacteria were grown at 37°C with agitation (200 r.p.m.) until the cultures reached an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm. Following a further 15 min incubation at 28°C, expression of the rex gene was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and growth of the culture was continued at 28°C for 4 h with shaking at 200 r.p.m. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellets were re-suspended in 75 ml ice-cold 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mM EDTA (buffer A). A cocktail of protease inhibitors [two tablets of Complete, EDTA free (Roche)] was also added. The cell suspension was then frozen at -20°C to weaken cell walls. Cells were next thawed and lysed by two passes through a French press operated at 18 000 psi. The cell suspension was centrifuged at high speed (100 000 g, 60 min, 4°C) to pellet insoluble cellular debris. The supernatant containing Rex was loaded directly onto a Q-Sepharose High Performance column (2.6 ¥ 10 cm) preequilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with six column volumes of buffer A, prior to eluting the proteins with a linear gradient of 0­1 M NaCl in buffer A over 20 column volumes. Fractions were analysed by UV spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE, and those containing Rex (eluting between 250 and 350 mM salt) were retained. The fractions were pooled and concentrated to about 5 ml by ultrafiltration (Centriprep concentrators, 10 kDa cut-off, Millipore). Rex in the pooled Q-Sepharose fractions was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 resin (column dimensions 2.6 ¥ 0.6 m). Rex eluted as a single peak using buffer A supplemented with 150 mM NaCl. The peak fractions were combined and diluted with an equal volume of 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Thereafter proteins were loaded onto a 5-AMPSepharose 4B column (column dimensions 1.6 ¥ 6 cm) preequilibrated in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The column was washed extensively (10 column volumes) with 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), then Rex was eluted with the same buffer containing a linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5; 0­1 M NaCl in buffer A over 20 column volumes). Eluted Rex was concentrated by ultrafiltration on Centriprep concentrators, with 10 kDa cut-off, to volumes of less than 2 ml and dialysed extensively into 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The final protein solutions were concentrated as previously described to ~1.5 mM. At this stage the protein was electrophoretically pure as judged by the absence of contaminating protein bands upon overloading a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Pure Rex was either used directly for crystallization trials or diluted to ~0.75 mM and dialysed against 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing glycerol (50% w/v) and stored in small aliquots (~100 ml) at -80°C. Spectroscopic analysis (UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy) did not indicate any NADH associated with the purified Rex.

Fig. 9. Model for the structural dynamics of Rex. The homodimeric protein exists in three distinct states; flexible, in complex with DNA and in complex with NADH. Binding to Rex operator sites (ROP) causes conformational changes in the nicotinamide binding pocket that lead to an increased affinity for NAD+. Binding of NAD+ acts to rigidify Rex, thereby limiting the conformational flexibility of the protein and stabilizing the interaction with DNA. Upon increasing NADH concentration in response to the redox poise of the cell NADH will bind to Rex with high affinity. This leads to release of Rex from DNA and fixation of the N-terminal DNA binding domains into a stable closed conformation that is unable to bind DNA with high affinity. The model is based on the available Rex structures. Chromosomal DNA was prepared from B. subtilis strain 1A1 (trpC2) as described previously (Lawson et al., 2004). E. coli strains TOP10 [mcrA D(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) F80lacZDM15 DlacX74 deoR recA1 araD139 D(ara-leu)7697 galU galK rpsL endA1 nupG] and TUNER(DE3) [F-ompT hsdSB gal dcm lacY1 (DE3)] were used for cloning and gene expression respectively. L-broth or L-agar was used for growth of E. coli strains (Sambrook and Russel, 2001).

Cloning of the B. subtilis rex gene
The gene encoding B. subtilis Rex was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides YDIH3 and YDIH4 (Table S1) and a B. subtilis chromosomal DNA template. The sequences of YDIH3 and YDIH4 include nucleotides complementary to the extreme 5-and extreme 3 ends of the Rex coding sequence respectively. The PCR product was cloned into the pET101/ D-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli TOP10 cells. The resulting plasmid pET101-rex was isolated and transformed into E. coli TUNER (DE3) cells (Novagen) for expression of rex. The integrity of the cloned gene was verified by DNA sequencing.

Crystallization and data collection
Initial crystallization conditions were found using the PACT Premier and JCSG+ Screens (Molecular Dimensions, UK)

using the nanovolume crystallization facility at MAX-lab, Lund, Sweden. Drops consisting of 0.1 ml protein +0.1 ml reservoir solution were dispensed in Greiner low profile 96-well plates using a Mosquito robot. Promising conditions were refined by hand. Crystallization of the apo form of Rex was achieved at 20°C by the sitting drop vapourdiffusion technique. A 2.5 ml of protein at 40 mg ml-1 in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was mixed with 2.5 ml of reservoir solution containing 20% w/v PEG 6000, 0.2 M NH4Cl and 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.1) and equilibrated against 300 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew in 2­3 weeks. The NADH form was achieved by soaking apo crystals at 4°C in cryo solution (the crystallization mother liquor with additional 20% ethylene glycol), containing 1 mM NADH, for up to 6 months. Data collected from a crystal soaked for 6 months were used for the structure determination. Shorter soaking times of typically 1­5 h gave very poor data, indicating disorder, and/or structures with no or very low occupancy for NADH. Co-crystallization of Rex with ATP was achieved at 20°C by hanging drop vapour diffusion. Two microlitres of protein at 20 mg ml-1 in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was mixed with 2 ml of reservoir solution containing 22% w/v PEG 6000, 0.2 M NH4Cl, 10 mM ATP and 0.1 M HEPES buffer (pH 7.1) and equilibrated against 300 ml of reservoir. Crystals grew in 2 weeks and were soaked for less than 1 min in the cryo-protectant prior to data collection. Data were collected at beamlines I911-3 and I911-5, on the ATP(/apo) and NADH form, respectively, at the MAXlab synchrotron in Lund, Sweden. I911-3 was equipped with a 225 mm marMosaic detector and I911-5 with a 165 mm marccd detector. A crystal of Rex:ATP measuring 150 ¥ 150 ¥ 20 mm belonged to space group C2 with cell dimensions as in Table S3, and diffracted to beyond 2.1 Å. Three hundred images were measured at 105 K and l = 1.000 Å with 0.6° rotation angle. The asymmetric unit contains one Rex dimer, giving a solvent content of 52.2% and a Matthews volume of 2.57 A3/Da. Data were collected to 2.2 Å resolution at 100 K and l= 0.907 Å from a crystal of Rex:NADH, which belonged to the same crystal form as the ATP complex (Table S3). One hundred and eighty images with 1.0° rotation angle were collected. All data sets were processed using XDS (Kabsch, 2001) and further treated using the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) run through the CCP4i interface (Potterton et al., 2003). For both the ATP and apo forms, a second related crystal form was found, also belonging to C2, with much larger cell dimensions: a = 264.7, b = 52.7, c = 103.9, b = 104.9° and three dimers in the asymmetric unit. These crystals grew in the same drops as those with the small unit cell. They consistently diffracted to lower resolution than the first crystal form (2.8 Å at best). The crystal packing was very similar in both forms and the crystals with large unit cell will not be discussed further.

homologue at the time, namely the Rex protein from T. aquaticus (Sickmier et al., 2005), PDB code 1XCB. This structure, to 2.9 Å resolution, contains 3.5 dimers and thus seven Rex polypeptides per asymmetric unit. Possibly due to the limited resolution these have highly diverse conformations in the loop regions. The B. subtilis Rex structure was solved using the automated MR pipeline MrBUMP (Keegan and Winn, 2007). The procedure has been described in detail as a case study (Keegan and Winn, 2007). Briefly, MrBUMP generated 42 models using different preparation methods. Each of the seven chains was used intact or in the form of the C-terminal domain only. Dimers were also used, without success. In the end only three of 42 models were successful: those derived from the monomeric C-terminal domain of chain F prepared using Molrep (Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997) or CHAINSAW, or from chain B prepared using CHAINSAW (Schwarzenbacher et al., 2004). In all three cases only Phaser (McCoy et al., 2005) was successful as a search engine. The solutions were poor, with Rfree (F) = 0.516, 0.538 and 0.540, respectively, after 30 cycles of Refmac5 refinement (Murshudov, 1997), but inspection of the first solution showed the expected dimeric association, with its domain-swapped C-terminal helix. This solution was used as fixed input to a search for the two N-terminal domains using Phaser. The structure was rebuilt using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and refined using Refmac5, incorporating TLS (Winn et al., 2001) in the later stages. Four separate domains were defined with separate TLS parameters. These were: chains A and B, residues 1­85 and 86­214. The apo and NADH forms were solved by deleting the waters and co-ordinates of ATP from the ATP complex, rigid body refinement using the above domain definitions, restrained atomic refinement and manual rebuilding as described above. Final statistics for the NADH, apo and ATP structures are given in Table S3. The crystal structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes 2VT2 (NADH complex) and 2VT3 (ATP complex).

Isothermal titration calorimetry
Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were preformed by titrating a ligand solution of one of the nucleotides into an approximately 10 mM Rex solution, at 25°C using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA, USA). Ligand and protein solutions were prepared in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The first injection was 2 ml and then 29 injections of 10 ml were made with an equilibration time of 10 min in between the injections. Data were fitted with the ORIGIN 7 software (MicroCal) using a one-site model. The concentration used for the ligand solutions were 75 mM for NADH and 1 mM for all the other nucleotides. In the titrations of nucleotides into mixtures of Rex and DNA (ldh2), a solution of 10 mM Rex and 5 mM DNA (ldh2) was used in the cell. The binding of different DNA-oligonucleotides to Rex was studied by titrating a Rex solution (160 mM) into a 5 mM DNA-oligonucleotide solution. Both in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). All the experiments with Rex and DNA-oligonucleotides were made with a 5 min spacing between injections.

Structure solution and refinement
The structure of the ATP complex was solved by molecular replacement (MR) using the co-ordinates of the only known

Surface plasmon resonance studies
Surface plasmon resonance studies of the interactions between Rex and DNA were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden). Streptavidin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) was coupled to the carboxydextran matrix of CM5 sensorchips using standard amine coupling, and remaining reactive groups were then blocked with ethanolamine. Biotinylated double-stranded ldh2-oligomer was bound to the streptavidin by flowing a 25 nM solution over the sensorchip. The ldh2-binding of Rex was monitored by injecting 50 ml of a ~100 nM Rex solution with or without the different nucleotides. Potassium phosphate buffer at 50 mM, pH 7.5 with 0.005% (w/v) Tween 20 was used as flow buffer. The normalized intensity for the dissociation phase of the DNA-Rex binding experiments was fit using a biexponential function:

I = Populationfast e - kofffast t + Populationslow e - koffslow t
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
DNA fragments containing the Rex binding sites were used as probes. The pairs of oligonucleotides used are listed in Table S1. They were annealed and radiolabelled using polynucleotide kinase and [g-32P]-ATP. Binding reactions (15 ml) were performed in 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mg of the non-specific competitor poly(dI-dC), and contained approximately 5 fmol of DNA. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30°C then loaded onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel in TBE. Gels were run at 20°C at 150 V, dried and analysed using a Phosphor Imager. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of Rex for the operator sequences were estimated by titration of 3 nM of DNA with increasing concentrations of Rex. The apparent Kd was defined as the amount of Rex necessary to shift 50% of the labelled operator.

Protein assays
Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using bovine serum albumin as standard using a correction factor of 0.9 for Rex determined by total amino acid analysis.
