Sex with two SOX on: SRY and SOX9 in testis development
Michael J. Clarkson and Vincent R. Harley
Although gonads are not required for development or survival, defects in gonadal development undoubtedly have a profound influence on affected individuals. Recent complementary studies in the fields of cytology, biochemistry and molecular genetics have revealed that normal gonad development involves an exquisitely regulated network of gene expression and protein­protein interactions. The initial event of gonadogenesis, in both males and females, involves the formation of a bipotential primordium. A Y chromosome then activates the male-specific pathway. The demonstration that mutations in the SOX proteins, SRY and SOX9, are responsible for disorders associated with male-to-female sex reversal showed dramatically that SRY and SOX9 have an essential role in male sex differentiation. This was emphasized when it was shown that female mice carrying transgenes that encode these proteins developed as males. SRY and SOX9 proteins have been characterized extensively and aspects of their function and regulation are now known.

Y chromosome, a gene or genes on the Y chromosome must initiate male development.
Male sex determination

Since antiquity, science and philosophy have used the tools of the day to investigate the nature of sex and how it is determined [1]. Despite the effort, many aspects of sex determination have remained frustratingly elusive. Recently, progress has been made in the identification and functional characterization of genes involved in formation of the genital ridge and in male sex determination. This review focuses on new developments regarding the function of two genes, SRY and SOX9, that have an essential role in directing male-specific gonad development.
Molecular determinants of genital ridge formation

In 1991, the cell type and gene responsible for male sex determination were conclusively identified. Palmer and Burgoyne showed that only Sertoli cells exhibit a selective bias for the presence of a Y chromosome [3]. In the same year, it was shown that the Y chromosome gene Sry (for sex-determining region on Y) could direct male development in a female mouse carrying an Sry transgene [4]. Later, these two discoveries were linked when it was shown that Sry is expressed at the time of male sex determination in pre-Sertoli cells [5,6]. Sequencing of the human SRY gene revealed that it encoded a protein containing a region of 80 amino acids that shares homology with the abundant nuclear protein, HMG1 [7]. The SRY protein can bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner [8] and, like HMG1, it can induce a bend in DNA [9]. Subsequently, >100 genes have been identified that encode proteins containing this domain, referred to as an HMG box [10], and those with the most extensive homology to the SRY HMG box gene are collectively termed SOX (SRY box) genes. SOX genes have been separated into eight subgroups (A­E), based on sequence homology in their HMG box [11] (Fig. 1).

The initial event in gonad development in both males and females is the formation of a bipotential primordium. This structure then differentiates and develops along a male- or female-specific pathway (Box 1). Gene knockout studies in mice have been invaluable for identifying genes involved in development of the bipotential gonad. The complete absence of gonads in mice lacking functional copies of Lim1 (also known as Lhx1), Sf1 (steroidogenic factor 1; also known as Zfp162), Wt1 (Wilms' tumor gene 1), Emx2 and Lhx9 is consistent with a role for these genes in the initial stages of gonad development [2]. This has been confirmed for Sf1, Wt1 and Emx2, where careful analysis of the null mutant phenotype showed that the gonad develops only for a short time but then arrests and regresses [2]. The complement of transcription factors present in the bipotential gonad is sufficient to initiate the differentiation of both male and female gonads. Because female gonads develop in the absence of a

In 2001, Hossain and Saunders showed that SRY is upregulated by the WT1(-KTS) isoform but not the WT1(+KTS) isoform in tissue culture reporter gene studies [12]. In mammals, WT1 can give rise to 24 different protein isoforms through a combination of alternative splicing, alternative translational start sites and RNA editing [13,14]. All isoforms contain four C-terminal C2H2 zinc fingers and an N-terminal Pro/Glu-rich region [13,14]. The +KTS and -KTS isoforms arise from an alternative splicing event that incorporates or omits, respectively, three amino acids ­ Lys, Thr and Ser ­ between zinc fingers 3 and 4 [13,14]. Analysis of the function of the +KTS and -KTS isoforms has revealed that they have very different biochemical properties. WT1(-KTS) is a classic transcription factor ­ in addition to upregulating SRY expression [12] it activates BCL2 (apoptosis inhibitor), CDKN1A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor), and DAX1 (maleness inhibitor; also known as NR0B1) [13,14]. In contrast, the

Box 1. Ontogeny of testis development
In mammals, the gonad develops from the intermediate mesoderm. This tissue is found on either side of the embryo and fills much of the coelomic or body cavity. The intermediate mesoderm is divided into three parts on the basis of structures that it forms during development. From anterior to posterior they are the pronephros, which gives rise to the adrenal medulla; the mesonephros, which gives rise to gonads; and the metanephros, from which the kidney develops. The first stages of sexual development cause similar changes in the mesoderm of both male and female embryos. During this indifferent or bipotential stage, the ductal systems form, starting with the male or Wolffian ducts (progenitor of the epididymis and vas deferens), followed by the female or Mullerian ducts (progenitor of the oviducts, uterus and upper vagina). The Wolffian duct produces branching tubules, which extend through the mesonephros towards the epithelium (coelomic epithelium). Cells in the coelomic epithelium proliferate, delaminate and join the gonadal cell population, accumulating on the surface of the mesonephros. During the bipotential stage, germ cells populate the gonad after migrating from the base of the allantois through the hindgut and mesonephros. This proliferation and cell migration causes the mesonephros to bulge and form the genital ridge. At this time, the fate of the gonad is decided, and in males, several things happen concurrently. The coelomic epithelium proliferates more rapidly than it does in female gonads. Cells from the mesonephros migrate into the gonad. Starting with the Sertoli cell, cells in the gonad differentiate. The testis then starts organizing into two distinct compartments ­ the testicular cords, which are the progenitors of the seminiferous tubules, and the interstitial region. Initially, Sertoli cells form clusters around germ cells. These clusters are then surrounded by peritubular myoid cells, which deposit a basal lamina in collaboration with Sertoli cells, sequestering germ cells inside testis cords. The androgen-producing Leydig cells are excluded from the cords and remain in the interstitial region in close proximity to arterial and lymphatic vasculature. While these changes are occurring in the gonad, the Wolffian (male) duct continues developing and the Mullerian (female) duct regresses.

WT1(+KTS) isoform does not appear to act as a transcription factor [15]. It has been proposed that this isoform has a role in RNA processing because it colocalizes with splicing speckles in nuclei and binds to the splice factor U2AF65 [13,14]. Recently, Hammes et al. [16] conducted an isoformspecific knockout, which disrupted the production of either the -KTS or +KTS isoforms of Wt1. Both male and female mice lacking the Wt1(-KTS) isoform have reduced gonad size, but cells in the gonads of male

Fig. 1. Features of the human SRY and SOX9 proteins. The human SRY open reading frame is 204 amino acids long and consists of an 80-amino acid HMG box DNA-binding motif, which binds to the DNA consensus motif A/T AACAAT A/T and bends DNA ~70° from linearity. The HMG box contains two nuclear localization signals (NLSs), one at each end. The N-terminal NLS forms part of a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain and the C-terminal NLS is bound by importin- (imp-). The SRY HMG box can also interact with positive coactivator 4 (PC4) in vitro. The last seven amino acids of SRY can bind to either of the PDZ domains found in SRY-interacting protein 1 (SIP-1). The HMG box of SOX9 is 70% identical to that of SRY, has conserved CaM and imp--binding regions and binds the consensus DNA motif AGAACAATGG. In addition, SOX9 carries a 90-amino acid sequence that binds heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in an ATP-independent fashion, and two regions that contribute to maximal trans-activation, one rich in Pro, Glu and Ala (PQA) and the other consisting exclusively of Pro, Glu and Ser (PQS).

mice exhibit male-specific marker gene expression, albeit at much reduced levels. The simplest explanation for this phenotype is that Wt1(-KTS) is required for gonad development in both sexes, but is not essential for male sex determination. Although this appears inconsistent with the demonstration that WT1(-KTS) activates SRY expression in tissue culture cells [12], the reduced levels of male-specific markers in Wt1(-KTS)-deficient mice suggest that Wt1(-KTS) could contribute to the full expression of Sry in vivo. Mice lacking Wt1(+KTS) have severe kidney defects, and although female gonad development appeared normal, male null mice exhibited complete XY sex reversal. Closer examination of gonad development in male mice lacking Wt1(+KTS) revealed that Sry transcripts are four times less abundant in these animals. These results indicate that Wt1(+KTS) is required for male sex determination and must have a role in Sry activation or Sry transcript stability. The phenotype of this mouse parallels the clinical defects found in Frasier syndrome patients. Individuals with this disorder contain mutations in intron 9 of the WT1 gene that disrupt the splicing event necessary to produce message encoding +KTS isoforms [17]. From these data, it has been proposed [16] that WT1(-KTS) is required for the development of both the male and female gonad, but is not essential for male sex determination. Specification of male gonad formation requires WT1(+KTS), which acts by increasing the abundance of SRY transcripts. The simplicity of this model is complicated by two issues. First, Wt1(-KTS) activates Dax1 [18], which encodes a protein product that antagonizes Sertoli cell development [19] (see below). Dax1 mRNA levels are reduced in mice lacking Wt1(-KTS). Thus, it is possible that male-specific markers are derepressed to low levels in Wt1(-KTS)-deficient mice because

they lack the repressor Dax1, and not because they are activated in the absence of Wt1(-KTS). Second, the overall level of WT1 produced in knockout mice did not change. Therefore, the disruption of one isoform effectively doubled the amount of the other isoform. A compelling argument that this overexpression probably does not contribute to the phenotype of the isoform knockout was presented by Hammes et al. in their consideration of the Wt1 splice variant knockout [16]. Hastie [14] suggests that the issue could be resolved by examining the offspring of isoform-specific deletions crossed with the Wt1 null mouse. These mice would therefore express wild-type levels of one isoform only.
SRY function

The expression of SRY in the gonad is followed by several events, including activation of male-specific downstream genes, cell migration and cell proliferation (Fig. 2). Analysis of SRY mutants isolated from XY sexreversed Swyer syndrome individuals has revealed that most contain mutations in their HMG box and are compromised in their ability to bind and/or bend DNA [8,20]. These studies indicate that SRY could modify the expression of genes leading to maleness by acting either as a classic transcription factor or by altering the architecture of DNA or chromatin.
http://tem.trends.com

Despite growing circumstantial evidence, confirmation of the role of SRY as a master regulator of male-specific gene expression has been hampered by two major issues. First, no genuine targets of SRY have been elucidated to date, and second, the only region of this protein that is conserved in mammals is the HMG domain [15]. Although this last point implies that only the HMG domain is necessary for the function of SRY, results obtained from studies of both human and mouse SRY suggest that this is not necessarily the case. Two SRY mutations that do not disrupt the HMG box have been isolated from individuals with XY sex reversal. One of these is a missense mutation in the N-terminal region and the other is a premature stop codon, C-terminal to the HMG domain [21]. In the mouse strain, Mus musculus molossinus, the Sry protein contains a large C-terminal extension that includes a Glu-rich region that acts as a transcriptional activator in vitro [22]. This region was required for male sex determination in this strain [23]. Interestingly, however, this region is not present in the M. m. domesticus subspecies. Thus, the HMG box is unquestionably necessary for the function of SRY, but it appears that there are other, species-specific regions of the protein that are required for its function. One proposal regarding the function of SRY as a transcription factor is that it acts to antagonize the function of repressors of male development (anti-testis genes). This suggestion has arisen from studies of WNT4 [24] and DAX1 [19]. In humans, duplication of either of these genes has been associated with XY sex reversal, indicating that they can override the effect of SRY [19,24]. Examination of the function of DAX1 has revealed several ways in which it could antagonize the function of SRY. DAX1 is an orphan nuclear receptor that can bind to another orphan nuclear receptor, SF1 [25], which is involved in the activation of male-specific genes [26,27]. It has been shown that DAX1 can inhibit transcriptional activation by SF1 through recruiting the nuclear receptor corepressor N-CoR [28]. Thus, DAX1 could indirectly inhibit SRY action by inhibiting the expression of male-specific genes activated by SF1. DAX1 also contains a domain that has similar biochemical properties to HMG domains, like the one found in SRY, in that it binds the minor groove of DNA and DNA hairpin loops [29]. Thus, DAX1 could compete directly with SRY for similar DNA structures involved in regulation of male-specific gene expression and directly antagonize its function. However, the demonstration that null mutations in DAX1 do not cause maleness in XX individuals [30] suggests that there must be other repressors of maleness, or that SRY must do more than just overcome the repressive effect of DAX1. In this last case, it is possible that the normal function of DAX1 would be to act as a check during female development to stop the inappropriate expression of male genes.

Such regulation would be important because sex determination takes place in a relatively short time and both male and female cells share several similar factors at this time. DAX1 also binds RNA [29]. Because SRY expression is influenced by another DNA-binding protein, WT1(+KTS) [16], it is possible that where DAX1 is overexpressed it might antagonize the function of WT1(+KTS), resulting in a decrease in the abundance of SRY mRNA. Sry is required for proliferation of the coelomic epithelium [31] and migration of cells from the mesonephros into the gonad [32], two processes that are crucial for testis development. Recently, it was shown in organ explant cultures that the migration of cells could be recapitulated in XX gonads through the ectopic application of the intercellular signaling molecule, fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9) [33]. Thus, SRY might direct cellular changes in the developing male gonad through the activation of Fgf9. Although this has not been formally demonstrated, it is consistent with gene ablation studies, which showed that Fgf9-knockout caused XY sex reversal [33]. However, this knockout result does not exclude the possibility that Fgf9 could operate in a pathway parallel to that of Sry.
SOX9 expression

from an introduced transgene [40], is also capable of inducing testis development. Thus, SRY and SOX9 are both necessary and sufficient for male sexual determination. Whereas the role of SRY in sex determination remains elusive, some mechanistic elements of the role of SOX9 in sex determination have been identified. Most notably, SOX9 is necessary for the activation of the gene encoding anti-Mullerian hormone [AMH, also known as Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS)] [26,27]. AMH is a transforming growth factor -like glycoprotein hormone, which is secreted by Sertoli cells and which causes regression of the female Mullerian ducts. Other factors, including Sf1 and Wt1, are also involved in the activation of the Amh gene, but in vivo dissection analysis of the promoter has shown that expression can only be completely abolished if the SOX9-binding site is disrupted [27]. In reporter gene studies, two domains at the C-terminus of the protein ­ one rich in Pro, Glu and Ser, and the other rich in Pro, Gln and Ala ­ were shown to be required for the transactivation function of SOX9 [41]. Thus, SOX9 can act as a classic transcriptional activator; however, its role in sex determination must be more extensive than just activation of Amh, because Amh-null mice are not sex-reversed [42].
SRY and SOX9 across species

Sox9 is a strong candidate for activation by SRY because it is upregulated in Sertoli cells just after Sry expression [34]. However, formal proof of this has been hampered by difficulties in identifying regulatory elements in the Sox9 promoter that direct sex-specific expression. Characterization of Odsex (Ods) mice, which exhibit XX female-to-male sex reversal, revealed that there is a deletion of 150 kb of DNA, 1.3 Mb upstream from Sox9 [35]. This study suggests that there is a distal represser element that is deleted in Odsex mice. Other studies support the implication from this result that the Sox9 regulatory region is very large and complex [36,37]. Mice transgenic for human YACs (yeast artificial chromosomes) containing up to 350 kb of DNA upstream from SOX9 could not direct Sertoli cell-specific gene expression [37]. Because of the differences in SRY structure and function between mice and humans [4,21], it is possible that differences in the function of these orthologs preclude the activation of human SOX9 by mouse SRY. This issue could be resolved by crossing mice containing the human SRY transgene with mice harboring the human YAC constructs.
SOX9 function

Although SRY and SOX9 are essential for male sex determination in humans and mice, their requirement and functions might not be conserved in all vertebrates. For example, the SRY gene is only found in mammals, and even though homologs have been found in eutherians, marsupials and monotremes, it is notably absent from two vole species and the spiny rat [43,44]. In chickens and alligators, SOX9 is activated after the initiation of testis formation, which indicates that this gene cannot have a testis-determining role in all vertebrates. These data suggest that sex determination is a rapidly evolving system that might contribute to speciation. Because the evolutionary basis of sex determination has recently been considered in several reviews [11,45], it will not be examined further here.
SRY- and SOX9-interacting proteins

SOX9 is a transcription factor that contains an SRY-related HMG box [11]. Like SRY, mutations that alter the expression or coding sequence of SOX9 have been found in phenotypically female patients with XY genotypes [38,39]. Ectopic expression of Sox9 in XX mice, either through disruption of a negative regulatory element in the Sox9 control region [39] or
http://tem.trends.com

Because it is becoming increasingly apparent that most transcription factors function in complexes, searches have been conducted to identify proteins that interact with SRY and SOX9. These searches have revealed several interacting factors, some of which are common to both SRY and SOX9, and others that are specific for one protein or the other (Fig. 1). Examining the role of these proteins has given some insight into how SRY and SOX9 might function or be regulated. One group of these proteins is involved in nuclear transport and the other is believed to act as transcription cofactors.

SRY and SOX9 interactions with nuclear transport proteins

Sequence analysis of SRY and SOX9 revealed that they contain conserved motifs that have defined interacting partners. At either end of the SRY/SOX HMG domain, there are consensus nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences [46,47]. Proteins with these consensus sequences are transported into the nucleus by cellular transporters called importins [48]. In transfected tissue culture cells, wild-type SRY and SOX9 exhibit nuclear localization; however, SRY or SOX9 from sex-reversed individuals containing mutations in either NLS exhibit both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization [46,47]. In a complementary investigation, it was shown that neither NLS was recognized by importin-, but the NLS at the C-terminus of the HMG domain (C-NLS) was recognized strongly by importin-. The results from these studies are the first example of clinically manifest mutations that affect nuclear transport. Although the NLS at the N-terminal end of the HMG box (N-NLS) is not recognized by importins, disruption of sequences in this region clearly affected nuclear localization of SRY. A calmodulin-dependent nuclear import pathway for transcription factors has been reported [49,50]. Interestingly, SRY binds to calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner in vitro via its N-NLS [51]. Calmodulin antagonists also inhibit the import and transcriptional activation potential of SOX9 [47]. Because the requirement for SRY and SOX9 is dosage dependent [52], it is possible that defects in male sex determination in sex-reversed individuals could arise from inappropriate localization of SRY or SOX9. In the case of SOX9, nuclear import might function to regulate the action of the protein, because the localization of this protein changes from cytoplasmic to nuclear coincident with the expression of SRY [34].

SRY-interacting protein 1 (SIP-1) was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with human SRY [53]. This protein had not been previously identified in functional screens, but homology searches found that it contained two PDZ domains (for PSD-95, Disc-large and Zo-1). PDZ domains have recently been described as modules that mediate protein­protein interactions [54]. It has been proposed that SIP-1 might link SRY molecules together or recruit other transcriptional regulators. In the first case, it is possible that SRY­SIP-1 complexes produce higher order nucleoprotein complexes, which might explain why SRY does not function in conventional reporter assays. Because the SIP-1 interaction domain of human SRY is not present in the mouse protein, this interaction is probably species specific. In another screen for factors that interact with SRY the gene encoding positive coactivator 4 (PC4; also known as Rpo2tc1 in the mouse and IFRD1 in humans) was isolated [47]. Because PC4 interacts with members of both the transcriptional machinery and a variety of transcriptional activators, it has been proposed that
http://tem.trends.com

this protein acts as an adaptor, linking the transcription machinery and activator proteins [55]. Mapping of the interaction between PC4 and SRY showed that it occurs through the HMG domain. Thus, this interaction could occur across species and might also be important for the action of other SOX proteins. Because this interaction was not disrupted by DNA binding, DNA-bound SRY could conceivably bind PC4 and recruit the transcriptional activation machinery. Interestingly, SRY only binds to the unphosphorylated form of PC4. PC4 is phosphorylated by the TFIID subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex [55]. This event is coupled with the release of PC4 from the complex and promoter clearance [55]. Therefore, a model can be constructed whereby SRY binds PC4 and recruits the transcription complex. Following formation of the preinitiation complex, phosphorylation of PC4 by the TFIID subunit might then clear the promoter and leave SRY free to recruit more unphosphorylated PC4. Recently it has been shown that SOX9 interacts with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) [56]. This interaction is not the result of the recognition of denatured SOX9, because it occurs in an ATP-independent fashion. Two features of HSP70 make it a good candidate for regulating the function of SOX9 in transcriptional activation. First, the HSP70 chaperone is involved in transcriptional regulation in other systems [57,58], and second, it interacts strongly with WT1 [59]. WT1 is required for full activation of the AMH gene in conjunction with SOX9 and SF1 [26]; however, there is not a consensus WT1-binding site in the AMH promoter region. Thus, WT1 could be tethered to the AMH promoter through interactions with SOX9 and HSP70. The demonstration that SOX9 and SF1 also interact [26] raises the possibility that the four proteins might form a tightly associated complex at this promoter. Because the HSP70-binding domain of SOX9 is conserved in other group E SOX proteins, this interaction might be a common feature of this class of SOX proteins. Although this interaction might be important in vivo, deletion of this region seems to have little effect on the trans-activation properties of SOX9 in vitro [41].
Perspectives

Several of the key processes and players of male sexual determination have been identified (Fig. 2). To develop models of how these factors might work it has been necessary to conduct extensive cytological molecular and genetic studies. From these studies, it is becoming increasingly apparent that sex determination is an intricately regulated network of gene expression, rather than a distinct pathway. Recent screens have revealed that there are many genes that have a sexually dimorphic expression pattern in the gonad [60]. Undoubtedly, some of these will contribute to testis formation and function. It will be a challenging task to characterize the role of all of these proteins in the network; however, we are optimistic about the future because history has shown that we can't stop thinking about sex!
