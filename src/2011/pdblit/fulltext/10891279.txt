Abstract New and improved methods to determine the membrane potential Z DC . and the D pH in methanogenic archaea were developed and tested in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain DH. The D pH measurements took advantage of the pH-dependent fluorescence properties of coenzyme F420 , the major intracellular electron carrier in the organism. The protonophore p-nitrophenol did not show any interference with the F420 fluorescence spectra and was therefore suitable to equalize internal and external pH. The method developed allowed the determination of the intracellular pH with an error of less than 0.05 pH units. Membrane potentials could easily be assessed using the fluorescent probe bis-Z1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid.trimethine oxonol ZDiBAC 4Z3.. with an accuracy of approximately 10 mV. Both methods were tested with cell suspensions of M. thermoautrophicum incubated at medium pH values between 5.5 and 8. It was found that DC and D pH values remained constant under these conditions. Membrane potentials were about y160 mV and D pH was kept at 0.35 pH units Zinside minus outside. resulting in a total proton motive force of about y180 mV Zinside negative.. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction Methanogenic archaea couple the process of methane formation to a net efflux of protons out of the cell ZThauer, 1998; Deppenmeier et al., 1999.. The generated proton motive force is used to drive ATP synthesis by means of the membrane-bound

ATP synthase. Determination of the proton motive force Z D p . requires measurement of both the membrane potential Z DC . and pH gradient Z D pH; pH in y pH out . across the cell membrane. The size of D p ZmV. is calculated by the well-known Mitchell equation ZEq. Z1..: D p s DC q 2.3 RTrFD pH Z mV .

w14 Cxbenzoic acid, and included laborious centrifugation or vacuum filtration steps ZJarrell and Sprott, 1981; Schonheit et al., 1984; Dybas and Konisky, ® 1992.. Alternatively, TPPq-specific electrodes were employed to monitor DC in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ZButsch and Bachofen, 1984., whereas intracellular pH has been determined by means of 31 P-NMR spectroscopy ZSauer et al., 1994.. A central electron carrier in methanogenic metabolism is the deazaflavin derivative coenzyme F420 . The compound is involved in a series of catabolic and anabolic reactions and is present in high concentration in the organisms ZDiMarco et al., 1990.. Coenzyme F420 displays an intense blue fluorescence under ultraviolet light. This property is very useful to detect methanogens in environmental samples by epifluorescence microscopy ZDoddema and Vogels, 1978.. Both the fluorescence and absorption spectra are strongly pH-dependent ZEirich et al., 1979.. In the protonated form ZpH - 5., F420 has maximal emission at 395-nm excitation. At pH 8 and above, the excitation peak has shifted to 420 nm. Recently, Von Felten and Bachofen Z2000. described a method for continuous monitoring the cytoplasmic pH using the pH-dependent absorption characteristics of F420 . In this paper, a similar but more sensitive method will be described, which takes advantage of the fluorescence properties of coenzyme F420 . The use of fluorescent probes as membrane potential indicators has found broad application in research on organisms from eukaryotic and eubacterial origin ZFreedman and Laris, 1981.. Probes are generally accurate and easy to apply. Still, the use of voltage-sensitive dyes in archaeal research is limited. The only example described in literature deals with the application of 3,3X-dipentyloxadicarbocyanine iodide ZDiO-C 5 Z3.. for determining membrane potentials in vesicle preparations of the extreme halophile Halobacterium halobium ZRenthal and Lanyi, 1976.. More recently, Beck and Huber Z1997. demonstrated that the membrane potential-sensitive probe bisZ1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid.trimethine oxonol ZDiBAC 4 Z3.. is an indicator to distinguish dead from viable cells for a variety of hyperthermophilic archaeal species. In this paper, we will show that DiBAC 4Z3. is also a very suitable probe for measuring membrane potentials in M. thermoautotrophicum.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Coenzyme F420 was purified from whole cells of M. thermoautotrophicum according to established procedures Zte Brommelstroet et al., 1990.; cell ex® tracts of the organism were prepared by methods described by the same authors. DiBAC 4Z3. was purchased from Molecular Probes ZEugene, OR, USA., 3,3X ,4X ,5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide ZTCS. was from Eastman Kodak ZRochester, NY, USA., valinomycin was from ICN ZCosta Mesa, CA, USA., and pnitrophenol from BDH ZPoole, UK.. All other chemicals were of the highest grade available. Gasses were supplied by Hoek-Loos ZSchiedam, The Netherlands.. To remove traces of oxygen, hydrogen-containing gasses were passed over a BASF RO-20 catalyst at room temperature; nitrogen-containing gasses were passed over a pre-reduced R3-11 catalyst at 150 8C. The catalysts were a gift of BASF Aktiengesellschaft ZLudwigshafen, Germany.. 2.2. Growth of M. thermoautotrophicum M. thermoautotrophicum strain DH ZDSM 1053. was cultured in a 12-l fermentor containing 10 l of mineral medium under a H 2rCO 2 atmosphere Z80r20%; vrv. at 65 8C and pH 7.0 ZSchonheit et ® al., 1979.. Medium contained the following constituents Zg ly1 .: KH 2 PO4 Z6.8., Na 2 CO 3 Z3.3., NH 4 Cl Z2.1., trace elements stock solution Z0.1%; vrv. ZSchonheit et al., 1979., and cysteineP HCl ® Z0.6., Na 2 S P 2H 2 O Z0.6. and Na 2 S 2 O 3 Z0.5. as reducing agents. M. thermoautotrophicum was grown in 25-ml amounts in crimp-sealed serum bottles Z115 ml.. Media were as described above and were adjusted to the desired pH Z5.0≠7.5. by addition of appropriate amounts of HCl or KOH. After inoculation, cultures were pressured daily with 80% H 2r20% CO 2 Zvrv; 200 kPa.. Growth took place at 65 8C. 2.3. Incubation of cell suspensions Cells were anoxically collected from 12-l fedbatch cultures or were obtained from serum bottle cultures. Samples were diluted inside an anaerobic

Cell suspensions were divided into 10-ml portions in 115-ml serum bottles. To dissipate the membrane potential in control series, TCS Z20 nmol mgy1 of dry weight. was added from a 1-mM stock solution in ethanol. The bottles were closed with black butyl rubber stoppers and aluminum crimped seals, evacuated and pressured with 80% H 2r20% CO 2 Zvrv; 200 kPa.. Hereafter, 1-mM titanium citrate ZZehnder and Wuhrmann, 1976. was added by means of a syringe to remove traces of oxygen. Ethane Z1 ml. served as the internal standard for methane measurements ZGijzen et al., 1991.. Reactions were initiated by placing the serum bottles in a waterbath at 65 8C. At regular times, head space samples were withdrawn and analyzed for methane on a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a Poropack Q column and a flame ionization detector. As soon as methane formation had started, the serum bottles were transferred to a rotary-shaking incubator operating at 200 rpm and 65 8C, and incubations were continued for 15 min. During this period, methane formation proceeded linearly in time. Reactions were subsequently stopped by rapidly cooling the serum bottles in ice-cold water. Serum bottles were opened and DC and D pH measurements were immediately performed. 2.4. D pH measurements For the preparation of calibration curves for pH measurements, cell suspensions were aerobically diluted to an OD600 of 0.20 in growth medium that had been adjusted to pH values ranging between 5 and 8. Next, p-nitrophenol Zfinal concentration, 24 mM. was added to equalize the intracellular and medium pH. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at room temperature on an AMINCO SPF-500 fluorimeter at excitation wavelengths varying between 340 and 370 nm Zband pass, 4 nm. and emission at 471 nm Zband pass, 2 nm.. In the calibration curve, the relative fluorescence Z Frel . is plotted against medium pH. Frel is defined as the ratio between the fluorescence emission at 423 nm ZF423 . and 398 nm ZF398 ., respectively. The latter wavelength refers to

the pH-isosbestic point in the spectra Zsee Results.. p-Nitrophenol causes a small red shift of 4 nm in the fluorescence, resulting in a redefinition of Frel as the ratio between fluorescence emission at 427 nm ZF427 . and 402 nm ZF402 ., respectively. To measure the pH gradient across the cell membrane, Frel was determined for the incubated cell suspensions, enabling calculation of the intracellular pH ZpH i . from the calibration curve. Hereafter, pnitrophenol was added to a final concentration of 24 mM, and fluorescence measurements were repeated. From the second Frel obtained, the external Zmedium. pH ZpH out . could be derived and checked against pH meter recordings. 2.5. Determination of the membrane potential Testing and calibration of DiBAC 4Z3. proceeded essentially as described by Freedman and Novak Z1989. and Rottenberg Z1979, 1989.. Unless specified otherwise, handling took place under air; cell suspensions and solutions were stored on ice. Fluorescence measurements were performed at ambient temperature on an AMINCO SPF-500 fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 494 nm Zband pass, 5 nm. and an emission wavelength of 518 nm Zband pass, 8 nm.. For the preparation of calibration curves, cells collected from 10-l fed-batch cultures were centrifuged Z10 min; 27,000 = g; 4 8C.. The pellets obtained were washed three times in 10 mM HEPES buffer ZpH 7.0. containing 0.2 M NaCl and centrifuged. Hereafter, pellets were taken up to a final OD600 of 0.20 in HEPES buffer containing 0≠1000 mM KCl. The buffer was kept at room temperature. After suspension, cell samples were divided into two portions. To one portion, DiBAC 4Z3. was added in a final amount of 0.8 nmol mgy1 of dry cells and the fluorescence Z Fpol . was immediately recorded. The second portion was firstly incubated with valinomycin Z2.5 nmol mgy1 of dry weight. to dissipate the potassium potential, and the fluorescence of the depolarized cells Z Fdep . was measured after addition of the same amount of DiBAC 4Z3.. Relative fluorescence changes Z%D F . were calculated according to Eq. Z2.: %D F s 100 Z Fpol y Fdep . rFdep

To determine DC in active methane-forming cell suspensions, DiBAC 4Z3. Z0.8 nmol mgy1 of dry weight. was added to cooled samples and the fluorescence Z Fpol . was measured immediately. Fdep was obtained after addition of the probe to control series that had been incubated in the presence of TCS Z20 nmol mgy1 dry weight of cells..

3. Results 3.1. pH-dependent fluorescence characteristics of coenzyme F4 2 0 in whole cells Whole cells ZOD600 s 0.20. were incubated in the presence 24 mM p-nitrophenol in growth medium of different pH Z3.5≠8.5. and fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of intracellular coenzyme F420 were recorded ZFig. 1A.. The excitation spectra showed prominent pH-dependent changes. The decrease from pH 8 to pH 5, for instance, resulted in the disappearance of the emission Z471 nm. at 427-nm excitation. The maximal emission wavelength was pH-independent and was situated at 471 nm. Fluorescence spectra of whole cells were identical to those obtained for purified coenzyme F420 Z10 mM. dissolved in media of the same pH values Zdata not shown.. The findings demonstrate that other intracellular components did not interfere F420 fluorescence and that the protonophore p-nitrophenol completely abolished differences between internal and external pH. In addition, p-nitrophenol did not show a significant fluorescence Z- 1%. in the 340≠460-nm excitation range ZFig. 1A.. In the presence of p-nitrophenol, changes in fluorescence characteristics took place around a quasiFig. 1. pH dependence of the fluorescence excitation spectra of intracellular coenzyme F420 . ZA.

isosbestic point at approximately 402 nm. In its absence, the point was located at a wavelength of 398 nm, both in whole cells and with purified F420 . A plot of the ratio between the 427- and 402-nm emission fluorescence Z Frel . at 471-nm emission versus the pH applied, gave a straight line for the physiological pH range 5≠8 ZFig. 1B.. 3.2. The use of coenzyme F4 2 0 as an intracellular pH indicator The above findings suggest the application of the F420 fluorescent properties as a means to measure the internal pH of the cells. To test this, cells from fed-batch fermentor cultures were collected at different growth stages and taken up in growth medium, both under oxic and anoxic conditions and in the

presence or absence of 24 mM p-nitrophenol. The cell suspensions were kept at different temperatures and fluorescence spectral changes were followed over time. During incubation at elevated temperatures Z) 45 8C. or at room temperature for prolonged periods of time, spectra initially changed Z t 1r2 5≠15 min, depending on the incubation temperature., but eventually stabilized. Comparison between fluorescence and pH meter measurements concluded that the final F420 spectra conferred the medium pH. Apparently, the spectral changes were the result of proton movements across the cell membrane such that internal and external pH were equalized. In contrast, no significant spectral changes were observed within a 15-min period of time, when cells were immediately cooled in ice. Spectral characteristics were independent of the type of cells Zexponential, stationary.. No differences were observed whether the procedure was carried out under oxic or anoxic conditions. Spectra only changed after addition of protonophore ZTCS, p-nitrophenol. to correspond the medium pH. The findings show that the F420 fluorescence spectra in the cooled samples are a good indicator of the intracellular pH. Our proposed procedure to determine the intracellular pH involves the simple dilution of cell samples in cold aerobic medium ZpH 7. and measuring the fluorescence at 423- and 398-nm excitation Zemission, 471 nm.. Calculation of the fluorescence ratio and relation to the calibration curve ZFig. 2. permits the assessment of the pH i . Control measurements using p-nitrophenol-treated cells generally showed a deviation of less than 0.05 pH units between pH meter recordings and the fluorescencebased method. In our experiments, cells were diluted to an OD600 s 0.20. At higher densities, fluorescence intensities increased in a non-linear way, which could be the result of quencing effects. Deviation from linearity was, however, relatively small Zless than 10% at OD600 s 1.. 3.3. The use of DiBAC4 (3) as a probe to determine the membrane potential DiBAC 4Z3. is an anionic probe, which distributes across the cell membrane according to a Nernst-type equilibrium ZBrauner et al., 1984.. Upon binding to ® proteins and membranes, the probe exhibits enhanced fluorescence and a red spectral shift Zexcita-

tion, 494 nm; emission, 518 nm.. To investigate the applicability of the compound for measuring membrane potentials in M. thermoautotrophicum, we first tested the effect of the presence of cells in combination with different ionophores on the fluorescence characteristics. No such effects were observed, if ionophores were added to the cell suspensions prior to the probe. The amount of probe used Z0.8 nmol mgy1 of dry cells. was chosen such that the relative difference in fluorescence emission intensities between polarized and depolarized cells Z%D F . was maximal. Before measurement, cell suspensions were diluted to an OD600 of 0.20. Fluorescence responses were found to be critically dependent on the cell densities employed. Consequently, calibration and measuring procedures took place at standardized cell density Zhere: OD600 s 0.20.. 3.4. Calibration and measuring procedures Calibration took place on the basis of Kq potentials ZFreedman and Novak, 1989.. Therefore, cells were extensively washed and suspended to OD600 s 0.20 in 10 mM HEPES buffer ZpH 7.0. containing 0≠1000 mM KCl. Emission responses were subsequently monitored in the absence and presence of

valinomycin Z2.5 nmol mgy1 dry weight of cells.. This gave the fluorescence intensities of the polarized Z Fpol . and depolarized Z Fdep . cells, respectively. When the relative fluorescence ratios Z%D F . expressed as 100Z Fpol y Fdep .rFdep were plotted against the logarithm of the external Kq concentrations, three linear sections were obtained ZFig. 2.. At low wKq x Z- 50 mM., relative fluorescence changes out were only small. The slope was highest at high external potassium concentrations. Under the latter conditions, cells tended to coagulate and the response is likely due to an artifact. The intermediate section ZwKq x s 50≠500 mM. included both the out ionic strength of the growth medium Z212 mM. and the concentration at which the extracellular and intracellular potassium concentrations were equal Z DC s 0 mV.. Membrane potentials were obtained from the Zextrapolated. mid-section of the calibration curve ZFig. 2.. To improve the quality of the calibration curve, the Kq concentrations were varied together with external Naq in such a way that the total ionic strengths remained constant Z200≠1000 mM.. However, no significant differences were observed with respect to the curve shown in Fig. 2. In order to measure the membrane potentials in energized cells from fermentor cultures or suspension incubations, samples were diluted to OD600 s 0.20 in ice-cold growth medium. The fluorescence response Z Fpol . was recorded immediately after the addition of the probe. Fdep was obtained from cells that had been incubated in the presence of TCS Z20 nmol mgy1 of dry weight.. This amount completely inhibited methane formation. In addition, the fluorescence response of TCS-incubated cells was equal to the one measured for broken cells. The observations indicate that TCS treatment resulted in the complete dissipation of the membrane potential. It should be noted that the fluorescence intensities of the polarized cells were always higher than those of the depolarized cells, giving positive-signed %D F values. This would imply that, in the case of polarized cells, DiBAC 4 Z3. was associated with positively charged residues present at the outer side of the cell membrane. The situation is reversed to the one in the calibration procedure that used Kq gradients in extensively washed cells. To derive the membrane potentials from fluorescence measurements ZFig. 2., DC values consequently should read with opposite

signs. In introductory experiments, measuring procedures were performed both under oxic and under carefully controlled anaerobic conditions. Both procedures gave identical results, provided that cells were anoxically collected, immediately cooled and transferred to cold dilution medium. 3.5. D pH and DC in M. Thermoautotrophicum D H The procedures described above were tested in a series of experiments in which cells were grown in serum bottles at pH values varying between 5.5 and 8. Hereafter, cells were diluted to OD600 s 0.20 in fresh medium of corresponding pH and the cell suspensions were incubated under 80% H 2r20% CO 2 or under 80% N2r20% CO 2 . Control series received TCS Z20 nmol mgy1 dry weight of cells.. Cells that were incubated under hydrogen atmosphere produced methane at a rate of 1.84 " 0.6 mmol miny1 mgy1 of dry weight, irrespective of the medium pH. No methane was formed by cells that had been incubated under nitrogen atmosphere, or in the presence of TCS. Following incubation, intracellular pH and membrane potentials were determined. It was found that H 2-incubated cells maintained a D pH across the cell membrane of 0.35 " 0.05 units Zinside alkaline. under all media pH values tested ZFig. 3.. Remarkably, same D pH values

were measured when cells were incubated under 80% N2r20% CO 2 . Intracellular and extracellular pH values were the same, when incubations had been performed in the presence of TCS. Cell suspensions incubated under 80% H 2r20% CO 2 built up a membrane potential of y160 " 5 mV at all pH values tested ZFig. 4.. In TCS-incubated cell suspensions, the membrane potentials were dissipated. From Eq. Z1., a proton motive force Z D p . of approximately y180 mV could be calculated for methane producing cell suspensions. DC values of the same size Zy180 " 5 mV. were obtained, when TCS Z2 nmol mgy1 dry weight. was added after incubation under 80% H 2r20% CO 2 ZFig. 4.. The addition abolished the pH differences across the membrane Zdata not shown.. Apparently, proton influx was counteracted by a redistribution of DiBAC 4 Z3. to a degree that the apparent DC became equal to the original D p. This finding indicates that the dye is reliable probe for membrane potential measurements. In the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4, cells were used that had been grown at small scales in serum bottles. D pH and DC measurements were also done on cells from fermentor cultures. Cells were anoxically sampled at different growth stages and directly analyzed for their intracellular pH and membrane potential. Alternatively, sampled cells were incubated in serum bottles, after appropriate dilution in fresh growth medium, and subsequently

analyzed. Direct measurements and suspension incubations gave the same results, notably if the incubations had taken place under comparable conditions ZpH, hydrogen partial pressure. as present in the fermentor during sampling. However, growth phaserelated differences were noted. Cells from the earlyand mid-exponential growth stages maintained significant D pHs Z0.6 units and more; inside alkaline. and membrane potentials amounted to at least y200 mV. Intracellular and extracellular pH equalized when cells entered the stationary phase. These cells kept their membrane potentials at y160 to y180 mV. The latter values further decreased in the course of the stationary phase concomitant to the decrease in methane-forming activity of the culture.

4. Discussion In this paper, simple and rapid methods are described to measure the D pH and DC in M. thermoautotrophicum cells. Both methods include a simple dilution step, fluorimetric measurements and comparison against calibration curves. D pH determinations take advantage of the pH-dependent fluorescent characteristics of coenzyme F420 , a low molecular-weight electron carrier which is present in the organism in concentrations as high as 2 mM ZVermeij et al., 1997.. Previous methods to measure the intracellular pH in methanogenic archaea were based on the D pH-dependent distribution across the cell membrane of radioactive-labeled compounds, like benzoic acid, methylamine or dimethylamine ZJarrell and Sprott, 1981; Kaesler and Schonheit, 1988; Dybas and Konisky, 1992.. These ® methods include elaborate washing, filtration or centrifugation steps that may negatively effect the accuracy. In addition, the methods are prone to systematic errors if the radioactive probes are metabolized, or if they do not enter the cells properly. Recently, a method was described by Von Felten and Bachofen Z2000., who used the UV-visible light absorption characteristics of coenzyme F420 for on-line monitoring the intracellular pH in growing cultures of M. thermoautotrophicum. In this method, cellular absorbancies are measured at multiple wavelengths. The absorption data are evaluated to address growth-related changes in cell scattering and in

background absorption of cellular components other than F420, and to account for F420 spectral differences which are the results of changes in the concentration ratios between oxidized and reduced F420 . Our method is based on the fluorescence properties of Zoxidized. F420 and the results obtained favorably compare the findings by Von Felten and Bachofen Z2000.. The method described here, however, has some additional advantages. The fluorescence properties of F420 are quite specific and measurements are not interfered by other cellular components. In addition, since F420 is highly fluorescing, our procedure can be applied at low cell densities ZOD600 s 0.2 and even less.. In the experiments described by Von Felten and Bachofen Z2000., measurements were made at approximately 10-fold higher cell densities. The method to determine the membrane potentials in M. thermoautotrophicum uses the fluorescence properties of DiBAC 4 Z3.. Voltage-sensitive probes are generally quite accurate, but results are critically dependent on the calibration procedure ZBrauner et ® al., 1984; Rottenberg, 1989.. Here, calibration was accomplished by imposing a transmembrane potential using valinomycin in conjunction with externally applied Kq solutions. The procedure resulted in curves that contained three linear sections ZFig. 2.. Fluorescence responses were lowest at low and highest at high external Kq concentrations, respectively. The high response is likely to be due to an artifact, since cells tended to coagulate under these conditions. Membrane potentials were determined from the mid-section of the calibration curve and extrapolation thereof. Obviously, extrapolation may not be justified. However, we calculate membrane potentials for M. thermoautotrophicum Zy160 to y200 mV, depending on the growth stage from which cells were sampled. that fully agree the data published in literature Zy160 to y200 mV. ZSchonheit et al., ® 1984; Butsch and Bachofen, 1984; Kaesler and Schonheit, 1988; Sauer et al., 1994.. Literature data ® were obtained by different methods involving the application of radiolabeled tracers ZTPPq, 86 Rbq . and TPPq-specific electrodes. Apparently, the method described here offers a reliable and experimentally simple alternative to estimate the membrane potentials in M. thermoautotrophicum. Methanogenic archaea are obligately anaerobic microorganisms. The presence of oxygen causes the

instantaneous inhibition of the process of methane formation, decrease of the cellular ATP concentrations and dissipation of the proton motive force ZRoberton and Wolfe, 1970; Butsch and Bachofen, 1984.. Therefore, all steps in the measurement procedures were initially performed under carefully controlled anoxic conditions. However, if cells are sampled anaerobically with immediate cooling, the same results are obtained after aerobic measurements. By the cooling, cells of the thermophilic organism apparently become fixed into an energetic status Z D pH and DC . which confers the in situ conditions, permitting measurements to be made easily under air.
