3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes participate in the protocatechuate branch of the 3-oxoadipate pathway of various aerobic bacteria. The gene encoding a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (pcaB1S2) was cloned from a gene cluster involved in protocatechuate degradation by Agrobacterium radiobacter strain S2. This gene encoded for a 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme of 353 amino acids ) significantly smaller than all previously studied 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzymes. This enzyme, ArCMLE1, was produced in Escherichia coli and shown to convert not only 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate but also 3-sulfomuconate. ArCMLE1 was purified as a His-tagged enzyme variant, and the basic catalytic constants for the conversion of 3-carboxy-cis,cismuconate and 3-sulfomuconate were determined. In contrast, Agrobacterium tumefaciens 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme 1 could not, despite 87% sequence identity to ArCMLE1, use 3-sulfomuconate as sub° strate. The crystal structure of ArCMLE1 was determined at 2.2 A resolution. Consistent with the sequence, it showed that the C-terminal domain, present in all other members of the fumarase II family, is missing in ArCMLE1. Nonetheless, both the tertiary and quaternary structures, and the structure of the active site, are similar to those of Pseudomonas putida 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme. One principal difference is that ArCMLE1 contains an Arg, as opposed to a Trp, in the active site. This indicates that activation of the carboxylic nucleophile by a hydrophobic environment is not required for lactonization, unlike earlier proposals [Yang J, Wang Y, Woolridge EM, Arora V, Petsko GA, Kozarich JW & Ringe D (2004) Biochemistry 43, 10424­10434]. We identified citrate and isocitrate as noncompetitive inhibitors of ArCMLE1, and found a potential binding pocket for them on the enzyme outside the active site.

Fig. 1. Initial steps in the protocatechuate branch of the 3-ketoadipate pathway. Key to enzymes: I, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase; II, 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme. Key to compounds: PC, protocatechuate; 3CM, 3-carboxy-cis,cismuconate; 4CL, 4-carboxymuconolactone.

Various aromatic compounds are degraded by bacteria under aerobic conditions via the catechol and protocatechuate branches of the 3-oxoadipate pathway [1,2]. In the protocatechuate branch of the 3-oxoadipate pathway, protocatechuate is initially oxygenolytically cleaved by protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase to 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate (3CM), which is then cycloisomerized by 3-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme (CMLE) to 4-carboxymuconolactone (Fig. 1). There is currently little information available on bacterial CMLEs from protocatechuate degradative pathways; only the CMLE from Pseudomonas putida (PpCMLE) has been studied in any detail. PpCMLE has been purified and characterized, the stereochemistry of the reaction analyzed, and the gene encoding it cloned and sequenced [3­5]. Furthermore, its crystal structure was recently determined [6]. Molecular and crystallographic studies demonstrated that the PpCMLE belongs to the fumarase II family of enzymes, which also includes class II fumarase, aspartase, adenylosuccinate lyase, argininosuccinate lyase and d-crystallin. All these enzymes are homotetramers with a conserved two-helix core. Fumarase family enzymes usually contain three different domains that interact intensively in the formation of the respective active centers [7,8]. We are currently studying the metabolism of protocatechuate and its sulfonated structural analog 4-sulfocatechol by a sulfanilate (4-aminobenzenesulfonate)-degrading mixed bacterial culture consisting of Hydrogenophaga intermedia S1 and Agrobacterium radiobacter S2 [9­11]. We have cloned a gene cluster from A. radiobacter S2 that appears to contain all the genes necessary for the degradation of protocatechuate to citric acid cycle intermediates [12]. Similar gene clusters have also been found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains A348 and C58 [13,14], and therefore appear to be characteristic for the organization of the genes involved in the degradation of protocatechuate in agrobacteria. The gene clusters contained ORFs, tentatively identified as encoding agrobacterial CMLEs (pcaB) [12­14], downstream of the genes
5170

encoding the subunits of the protocatechuate-3,4dioxygenase (pcaHG). Recently, we described the molecular characterization of two CMLEs from H. intermedia S1 and A. radiobacter S2 that take part in the degradation of 4-sulfocatechol by a modified version of the 3-oxoadipate pathway (they are part of the sulfocatechol gene cluster) [15]. These enzymes convert not only 3CM, but also 3-sulfomuconate (3SM), and have therefore been described as type II CMLEs; they are named HiCMLE2 and ArCMLE2. Surprisingly, it was found that the `type I' enzyme from the protocatechuate pathway (and gene cluster) of P. putida was also able to convert 3SM. This raised the question of whether all CMLEs from the `traditional' protocatechuate degradative pathways are also able to convert 3SM. We decided to analyze the CMLE from the protocatechuate gene cluster of A. radiobacter S2, which we designate here as ArCMLE1, to distinguish it from the `type II' ArCMLE2 (see above). In agrobacteria, the protocatechuate branch of the b-ketoadipate pathway differs significantly from those of other bacteria in gene organization and regulation [13,16,17], making ArCMLE1 an interesting target for structural and functional studies.

Results
Cloning and sequencing of the pcaB1S2 gene An ORF was identified in a gene cluster from strain S2 directly downstream of the genes coding for the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (P34OI) (pcaH1G1). It showed significant sequence identity to known CMLEs. The sequence of the gene encoding the putative CMLE was determined using the previously constructed plasmid pMCS2-I-39B [12] (Table 1). The gene was designated as pcaB1S2 (¼ pcaB from the type I gene cluster of strain S2) in order to differentiate it from the previously studied type II gene from the sulfocatechol gene cluster of the same organism [15]. The gene encoded a protein (ArCMLE1) consisting of 353 amino acids with a GC content of 60.6%.

ArCMLE1 showed the highest degree of sequence identity to presumed CMLEs from A. tumefaciens (87% sequence identity to A. tumefaciens CMLE [14]). The sequences of the CMLE1s from members of the Rhizobiales, such as ArCMLE1 and AtCMLE1, are significantly shorter than the isofunctional enzymes from other bacteria (Fig. 2). Expression of ArCMLE1 Comparison of the sequence of ArCMLE1 with that of the recently published crystal structure of the CMLE from P. putida [6] suggested that the C-terminal enzyme domain was completely missing in the agrobacterial enzymes. Therefore, plasmid pSHCMC1S2 was constructed by amplifying pcaB1S2 and cloning the gene into the expression vector pJOE3075 (see Experimental procedures). After the addition of rhamnose, an intense new peptide band with a molecular mass of about 37 kDa was observed in crude extracts of Escherichia coli JM109(pSHCMC1S2) using SDS / PAGE. Conversion of 3CM Escherichia coli JM109(pSHCMC1S2) was grown in LB / ampicillin medium plus rhamnose. Cell extracts were prepared, and the CMLE activities in the cell extracts were tested using the spectrophotometric enzyme assay originally described by Ornston & Stanier [18]. The overlay spectra demonstrated that the cell extracts from E. coli JM109(pSHCMC1S2) converted 3CM to 4-carboxymuconolactone, and a CMLE activity of 9.4 UÆmg)1 of protein was determined. In contrast, no conversion of 3CM was found in cell extracts of E. coli JM109, which did not harbor the plasmid. Kinetic parameters for A. radiobacter S2 CMLE1 ArCMLE1 was purified by affinity chromatography on an Ni­nitrilotriacetic acid matrix to  98% purity. The

purified enzyme (0.05 mgÆmL)1) was almost completely stable during 36 days of storage at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris / HCl plus 100 mm NaCl and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. In contrast, after storage for the same time at room temperature or at ) 20 °C in the same buffer system, it lost more than 50% of its activity. ArCMLE1 has a pH optimum of 6.0­7.0. The KM, Vmax and kcat values for 3CM were calculated as 0.32 ± 0.04 mm, 2270 ± 140 UÆmg)1, and 84 900 min)1. The purified enzyme was also incubated with 3SM, and the conversion of the substrate was analyzed by HPLC. The enzyme converted 3SM to 4-sulfomuconolactone, as previously observed for the CMLEs from the 4-sulfocatechol degradative pathway (`type II enzymes') and the CMLE1 from P. putida (PpCMLE1) [15]. As HPLC analysis is slower, only a rough estimate of the reaction constants could be obtained; the KM was about 11.3 ± 3.3 mm, the Vmax was about 130 ±30 UÆmg)1, and the kcat value was about 4900 min)1. Ornston [3] showed that PpCMLE was inhibited by 100 mm citrate. A very similar effect was also observed for ArCMLE1, suggesting that citrate had a specific effect on this group of enzymes. Because citrate has some structural resemblance to 3CM, we measured kinetics in the presence of citrate, with isocitrate as a negative control, in order to determine the nature of the inhibition. Surprisingly, both citrate and isocitrate acted as noncompetitive inhibitors (Fig. 3), lowering the Vmax but not the KM of the lactonization reaction. The KI value is 18.0 ± 2.2 mm (± SEM) for citrate and 7.4 ± 0.5 mm for isocitrate. Isocitrate and citrate thus do not bind to the active site, but to somewhere else in the protein. Conversion of 3SM by the CMLE from A. tumefaciens A348 The results obtained for ArCMLE1 and previously for PpCMLE [15] suggested that the type I enzymes from `traditional' protocatechuate pathways could also

extracts from E. coli JM109(pARO569) had rather high specific activity with 3CM (8.7 UÆmg)1), but showed no activity with 3SM. This was surprising, because AtCMLE1 has 87% sequence identity to ArCMLE1.

The left-hand panel shows a double reciprocal plot of the inhibition by citrate at concentrations of 7.5 mM (h), 10 mM (m), 15 mM (.) and 25 mM (d). The right-hand panel shows a nonlinear curve fit of isocitrate inhibition at concentrations of 5 mM (s), 7.5 mM (h), 10 mM (m) and 25 mM (d). The difference between the nonlinear fits for noncompetitive and competitive inhibition models for both citrate and isocitrate were significant at the 0.01% level by the F-test. The values of r2 and sum of squares ( · 10)3) were as follows: citrate, competitive 0.92 and 518 versus noncompetitive 0.95 and 351; isocitrate, competitive 0.98 and 121 versus noncompetitive 0.99 and 58.

Site-directed mutagenesis of ArCMLE1 From the crystal structure of the P. putida CMLE [6] and sequence comparisons with other members of the fumarase II family, it was proposed that Trp153, Lys282 and Arg315 are involved in catalysis. The alignment of the small CMLEs from different members of the Rhizobiales with these sequences demonstrated that in A. radiobacter S2 (and the other member of the Rhizobiales), the amino acid residues corresponding to Lys282 and Arg315 were conserved, but that Trp153 in P. putida was always replaced by an Arg. To determine whether the amino acid at this position is important for the enzymatic reaction, the R155A mutation was introduced into ArCMLE1 by site-specific mutagenesis. The resulting mutant enzyme did not show any activity with 3CM or with 3SM. A gel filtration experiment demonstrated that the mutation did not alter the tetrameric behavior of the protein, indicating that the mutation affected the catalytic machinery directly, rather than the oligomeric state of the enzyme. Overall structure The variation in size and the observed amino acid modification between PpCMLE and ArCMLE suggested important differences between the two enzymes. Therefore, the crystal structure of the A. radiobacter

S2 ArCMLE1 was determined. ArCMLE1 is very sim° ilar to PpCMLE (rmsd of 1.6 A for 1192 Ca atoms of a tetramer and 1.44 for 306 Ca atoms of a monomer). This indicates that not only is the monomer structure conserved, but also the quaternary structure of the tetramer. Despite this, ArCMLE1 completely lacks the C-terminal domain and the very C-terminal helix (Fig. 4). The lack of this helix, although it seems to be needed for monomer interactions in PpCMLE, nonetheless does not affect the overall oligomeric organization. In both ArCMLE1 structures, the asymmetric unit consists of 12 monomers that form three physiologic tetramers. Monomers generally contain residues 2­268 and 281­350 (see Experimental procedures); the missing 8­13 residues (depending on the monomer) form a loop covering the active site. In some of the monomers in the P212121 structure (Table 2), we have more electron density for the loop and were able to model a few more residues, including the Lys279 that points into the active site. Monomers in the P21 structure are also very similar ° to each other; the rmsd / Ca is 0.19­0.54 A, with an ° average of 0.31 A. In the P212121 structure, the devi° ° ation range is 0.29­0.58 A, with an average of 0.39 A. The deviations between the monomers in the P212121 structure are larger than in the higher-resolution P21 structure, especially monomer J in P212121, which has an average deviation from the other monomers of ° 0.49 A / Ca. This is presumably due to crystal contacts;

Structure of Agrobacterium type I CMLE

monomer J contains several regions with poorly defined electron density, in particular loop 41­66, which lies in the interface between the EFGH and IJKL tetramers, and residues 89­104, which form a helix­loop structure on the surface. Deviations between monomers of the two structures are in the same range as within independent structures. Monomer H from the P21 structure clearly differs most ° from the others, with an rmsd / Ca of 0.38­0.54 A (depending on the comparison structure). This difference is largely a result of changes at the C-terminus of helix 51­65, caused by crystal contacts with an adjacent asymmetric unit. In monomer I, this region is also different than in all other monomers, although it does not participate in crystal contacts. The B-factors (Table 2) for this region are similar in all the monomers, and so the differences appear to be caused by discrete independent conformations, rather than continuous flexibility. Potential allosteric binding site We observed an unexplained continuous electron density region near Trp227, which forms the base of a binding site formed from two adjacent monomers (AB, BA, CD, DC). This region was present in all monomers at about 4.5­6.5r in the final rA-weighted (Fo­Fc) electron density map (Fig. 5). The hydrophobic portion of the AB pocket is formed by Trp227A, Ile234A and Met117A (the superscript here and below indicates the monomer). The hydrophilic part of the pocket probably binds negatively charged molecules because it is formed by Arg224A, Gln230A, Arg177B and Arg181B. Asp232A forms ion pairs with Arg177B and Arg181B. The residues come from A helix 109­145, the N-terminus of

A-helix 231­260 and the preceding loop 220A)230A, and from the B monomer helix 165­187. We could not fill the electron density region with water molecules or with any of the crystallization or purification components (Tris, Mes, cacodylate, dithiothreitol or 2-methyl2,4-pentanediol), or with obvious candidates from E. coli, such as aconitate. The shape of the electron density region did not seem to change when we cocrystallized with 40 mm citrate, and nor did it depend on whether or not we added 3SM to the crystallization drop. It is therefore most likely the result of a small molecule that binds tightly to the protein during expression or purification. Experiments using ESI MS coupled with liquid chromatography experiments to identify the molecule were, unfortunately, inconclusive (data not shown). The AB pocket (i.e. mostly monomer A including ° Trp227A) is 13 A from the DAB active site (measured ° from the Ca of Arg312; Fig. 4), 42 A from active site ° from active site BCD, and 42 A from act° ABC, 36 A ive site CDA. It is therefore possible that binding to this site modulates the activity in the active site. The effect could be transmitted through loop 224­231; this lies below the active site arginine (Arg312), which appears to be essential for substrate binding (see Discussion). Furthermore, sequence alignment suggests that the 224­231 loop may be important in modifying the substrate spectrum of ArCMLE1 (see below). Residue Arg224 is not conserved in other CMLEs, and Arg177 and Arg181 are not conserved in the `type II' CMLEs (Fig. 2). This suggests that these enzymes may not have the binding pocket that we have identified. Furthermore, even in PpCMLE, this potential allosteric binding pocket is filled mainly by the Arg232 side chain, which in ArCMLE1 and AtCMLE1 is glycine.

Active site Each of the four active sites per tetramer is formed from three monomers, as mentioned above. Below, we describe the geometry in the DAB active site, although the others are essentially identical; the chain identities merely permute. We describe this as the `A' active site, as chain A forms the base of the active site. Although 3SM was used in the crystallization mixture, we did not see it in the active site. Instead, a chloride ion could be modeled into some of the active sites where the spherical electron density near Arg155B indicated a molecule heavier than water. The active site of ArCMLE1 shows important differences in comparison with PpCMLE (Fig. 6A). Trp153B was proposed to be a critical residue in the catalytic mechanism of PpCMLE [6], but in ArCMLE1 this residue is replaced by Arg155B. Arg155B (and Trp153B in PpCMLE) also

participates in monomer­monomer interactions, and there are changes in the surrounding residues correlated with the Trp fi Arg change. In PpCMLE, Trp153B undergoes a hydrophobic interaction with Leu317A. This leucine is replaced by glycine in ArCMLE1, thus creating room for Glu286D, which forms a salt bridge with Arg155B. The equivalent of Glu286D in PpCMLE is Ala289D. On the opposite side of the active site, PpCMLE His321A is replaced by Met318A (Fig. 6A). Overall, the `top' of the active site (Fig. 6A) maintains a positive hydrophobic axis, with one side positive and the other side hydrophobic, but the identity of the residues is completely changed. The change from PpCMLE Leu317A to ArCMLE1 Gly314A, together with a reorientation of the C-monomer main chain due to a peptide flip at position 314A, makes room for the Arg-Glu pair mentioned above (Fig. 6A).

[6] located a citrate molecule at a very high B-factor in one of the active sites of a tetramer and, as in our P212121 structure, they could see a few more residues of the loop, including the lysine pointing towards the active site. The binding mode of citrate in the PpCMLE structure agrees with our structure in the sense that it binds to the active site arginine (Arg312A), which is in a similar conformation in both structures. Our preliminary docking results (data not shown) also indicate that one of the carboxylates of citrate would be actually bound to the Arg155B in ArCMLE1. Below the active site Trp317A and Trp321A (Fig. 6A), there is a cavity filled with 14 ordered water molecules (Fig. 6B). This cavity is in the interface between monomers A and D and is surrounded mainly with hydrophobic residues (Pro5D, His8D, Phe10D, Leu11D, Phe24A, Val82A, Ile112A, Leu116A, Leu120A, Ile234A, Leu324A, Trp317A, Trp321A and Pro325A). The water cavity near the active site may be important in creating the flexibility required for the enzyme catalysis. Modeling of A. tumefaciens CMLE We constructed a homology model of AtCMLE1 (87% identical to ArCMLE1) to determine why it does not lactonize 3SM, unlike ArCMLE1. The sequence of the loop covering the active site is identical in both enzymes and therefore is unlikely to contribute to this difference in specificity. There are no changes in the active site, but there are a few changes in the region between the active site and the `allosteric binding site' identified above. As both sites are formed by multiple monomers, we refer here to the DAB active site, which is close to the AB `allosteric binding site'. His228A and Asn229A of ArCMLE1 are Asn and Ser, respectively, in AtCMLE1. Asn229 of ArCMLE1 is not conserved in other enzymes that degrade 3SM (Fig. 2), but only AtCMLE1 has Asn at position 228. His228A in ArCMLE1 is very close to Arg312A (Fig. 6B), which presumably binds substrate. Although the residues are not hydrogen bonded, the removal of the positive charge next to Arg312A might have an effect on substrate binding. Furthermore, His228A is in the same loop as Arg224A, which is part of the `allosteric binding site' 224­232 loop and adjacent to the Trp227 forming the basis of this binding site (see above). Finally, ArCMLE1 Gln308A is replaced by His308A, and Val289D and Thr290D on helix 283­308 are both mutated to Ala in AtCMLE1. These changes might affect the flexibility at the back of the active site.

Discussion
Truncation of the C-terminus ArCMLE1 is the first truncated CMLE that has been characterized; indeed, it is the first truncated fumarasefold enzyme. Its C-terminal truncation includes the whole of the C-terminal domain, including the very last helix which, in homologous enzymes such as PpCMLE [6] and ArCMLE2 [15], folds back into the protein core and participates in monomer­monomer interactions. Sequence analysis (Fig. 2) suggested this to be the case, and our structure demonstrates that, indeed, it is so. The C-terminal domain is thus not required for formation of the oligomeric structure; the rmsd between ° PpCMLE and ArCMLE1 is 1.6 A for the tetramer and ° for the monomer. In addition, it seems clear that 1.4 A the C-terminal domain is not important in catalysis; the truncation increased kcat to over 105 min)1 (versus values of 0.067­23 · 103 min)1 for other enzymes [15]). ArCMLE is thus the fastest CMLE so far characterized. If the rate-determining step is product release, as is often the case for noncontrol point enzymes [19], the increase in kcat may reflect faster binding and release because the `upper jaw' of the active site is missing. There is no significant difference in the KM for 3CM, except for PpCMLE, the KM of which is three times smaller than that of other enzymes we have studied [15]. Substrate spectrum Type I enzymes were believed to show no or only very limited activity with 3SM [10], but our results demonstrate that ArCMLE1 not only catalyzes the lactonization of 3SM, but does so even faster than the type II counterparts. The Km values with 3SM for both A. radiobacter CMLEs and also the type II enzyme from H. intermedia are relatively poor (7­15 mm). The kcat / Km ratio for 3SM versus 3CM (relative kcat / Km) suggests that a distinction can be made between type I enzymes and type II enzymes, with improved enzymatic specificity for 3SM. For instance, ArCMLE1 has a relative kcat / Km for 3SM versus 3CM of 0.0016, whereas the type II enzymes H. intermedia CMLE2 and A. radiobacter CMLE2 have relative kcat / Km for 3SM versus 3CM of 0.73 and 0.21, respectively [15]. Nonetheless, ArCMLE1 catalyzes the lactonization of 3SM better in terms of kcat and kcat / Km than any of the type II enzymes studied except HiCMLE2 [15]. The basis for 3SM specificity is still unclear. Although ArCMLE1 can lactonize 3SM, AtCMLE1 cannot, and so homology modeling should allow the identification of the specific amino acid changes that

affect substrate specificity. Surprisingly, there are no changes in residues in the active site cavity, so all changes in catalytic activity are due to secondary changes outside the active site. We have identified four possible amino acid changes; His228 fi Asn, Val289 fi Ala, Thr290 fi Ala and Gln308 fi His (ArCMLE1 fi AtCMLE1) (Fig. 2). The His228 fi Asn change may reduce the overall positive charge in the active site, whereas the Val289 fi Ala, Thr290 fi Ala and Gln308 fi His changes may affect the conformation or flexibility of the active site. These small changes may thus prevent binding of 3SM in a catalytically competent manner. The situation is analogous to that in the muconate lactonizing enzyme from P. putida and Pseudomonas sp. P51 chloromuconate lactonizing enzyme. In these enzymes, changes that are not part of the active site affect conformational flexibility in the active site and thus whether dehalogenation occurs on the enzyme or not. This dehalogenation requires a rotation of the newly formed lactone ring by 180° [20]. Allosteric site Our inhibition experiments with citrate and isocitrate showed that they are noncompetitive inhibitors of ArCMLE1, despite the structural resemblance to the substrate molecule. They do not compete with substrate, but bind somewhere else in the protein and modulate its activity. Intriguingly, we located a possible binding site ° 13 A away from the active site, separated from the active site only by Trp227, which forms the base of the allosteric site, and by His228 and Asn229, which also appear to cause the difference in substrate specificity between ArCMLE1 and AtCMLE1. The binding site contains three arginines (Arg224, Arg177 and Arg181) but, although the density superficially resembles that of citrate, we were not able to fit citrate-like molecules confidently into it, nor to detect a small molecule ligand by ESI MS coupled with liquid chromatography. Active site The type I enzyme from P. putida (PpCMLE), with a KM for 3CM four times smaller than that of ArCMLE1, contains a tryptophan residue in the active site (Trp153). Yang et al. [6] proposed that the reaction starts by nucleophilic attack of the oxygen of the 6-CO2­ group on position C3 of 3CM to form an aci-intermediate, which would be stabilized by PpCMLE Arg315. The reaction then proceeds by proton transfer from the general base (PpCMLE Lys282) to the aci-intermediate to form 4-carboxymuconolactone. The hydrophobic environment created

by Trp153 has been proposed to activate the nucleophilic carboxylic group of the substrate [6]. Trp153 is, in ArCMLE1, Arg155, and so the same activation cannot occur in this enzyme. We also made the Arg155 fi Ala variant, as Ala is found at this position in type II enzymes (Fig. 2). This variant was completely inactive, which is not surprising, as Arg155B forms a salt bridge with Glu286D. Two changes can be predicted in the mutant. First, there is an increase in the negative charge in the active site and, second, breaking the salt bridge would alter the quaternary structure of the protein and therefore the active site architecture. Both changes would lead to an inactive enzyme. In some type I enzymes, the residue corresponding to Arg155 is Leu (Fig. 2), whereas it is Ala in the type II ArCMLE2 and HiCMLE2 (Fig. 2) [15]. This sequence variability, together with the structural role of the Arg / Trp (see above), makes it unlikely that this residue is required for catalysis as previously suggested [6]. A positive charge appears, however, to be required on the `right' (Fig. 6A) of the active site. When the residue corresponding to ArCMLE1 Arg155 is hydrophobic, the disordered loop covering the active site contains a positive charge at Gly270 and Gln280 (Fig. 2). Another change in comparison with the other CMLEs is at position 275, where PpCMLE has a Thr instead of Ala; this might cause the 10-fold lower Km for 3CM observed in PpCMLE. None of these residues, Lys273, Thr278 and Arg283, are visible in the PpCMLE model, and therefore we cannot assess their roles. Finally, the fumarase class II charge relay pair (His141-Glu275) is replaced by Trp153-Val283 in PpCMLE and by Arg155-Glu286 in ArCMLE1. Although the charge properties are thus preserved in ArCMLE1 (although not in PpCMLE), Arg is a very poor general acid and so is unlikely to participate in the reaction mechanism. Preliminary docking results suggest that the binding mode proposed by Yang et al. [6] is possible for ArCMLE1 as well. The lowest-energy docking results, which show direct interaction between 6-CO2­ and Arg155B, are probably not physiologic, because this residue is involved in stabilizing the interaction with chain D. If substrate binds as in Yang et al. [6], Arg312A could help withdraw electrons from the 1-CO22­ group to make the 3-position more electrophilic; it would also stabilize the aci-carboxylate intermediate. This would allow Lys279, as proposed by Yang et al. [6], to act as the general acid. There are, however, candidates for the general acid other than Lys279: conserved histidines His103 and His278. The latter is also part of the mobile loop, and in PpCMLE it points towards the active site (Fig. 6A).

Structure of Agrobacterium type I CMLE

Our structure, mutagenesis and comparison studies indicate that the exact mechanism of ArCMLE1 and other CMLEs is far from settled. The role of the interactions around Arg155 remains unclear, as does the importance of nucleophile (6-CO2­) activation. In addition, it is interesting that, in muconate lactonizing enzymes as a rule, residues outside the active site cavity have significant effects on catalysis, in some cases changing the reaction stereochemistry [20], and here affecting reaction specificity dramatically. The structural basis for these effects remains to be explored.

kit from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.

Nucleotide sequence analysis
The DNA sequences were determined by dideoxy-chain termination with double-stranded DNA of overlapping subclones in an automated DNA-sequencing system (ALFSequencer; Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) with fluorescently labeled primers. Sequence analysis, database searches and comparisons were performed with the lasergene software package, version 5 (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) and the blast search program at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [25]. The alignments of the CMLEs were obtained with the program clustalx using the default parameters [26].

Experimental procedures
Bacterial strains and media
A. radiobacter S2 (DSMZ 5681) was cultivated in SHPG medium as previously described [9,10]. E. coli DH5a and E. coli JM 109 were used as host strains for recombinant DNA work. The E. coli strains were cultured in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 lgÆmL)1). The sequence of the gene encoding the putative CMLE was determined using the previously constructed plasmid pMCS2-I-39B, and E. coli BL21(DE3)(pLysS)(pETS2-X-II) was used for the synthesis of 3CM from protocatechuate [12].

Expression of ArCMLE1 and AtCMLE1 in E. coli
For recombinant expression, pcaB1S2 from A. radiobacter S2 was inserted into the expression vector pJOE3075, to produce a C-terminal His-tagged enzyme, as follows [23]. The DNA segments encompassing pcaB1S2 were amplified by PCR using the primers CMLEI-X-N (ATA ACA TAT GAG CCT TTC CCC CTT CGA AC) and CM LEI-His-C (AAA GGA TCC GCT TTC GTC AGC CCC CAG C), thus introducing NdeI sites upstream and BamHI sites downstream of the gene. The following PCR program was used: an initial denaturation (94 °C, 1 min) was followed by 30 cycles consisting of an annealing step at 65 °C (1 min), a polymerization step (72 °C, 2 min), and denaturation step (94 °C, 1 min). The amplified product containing pcaB1S2 was then cleaved with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into pJOE3075 (also cut with NdeI and BamHI). The resulting recombinant plasmid pSHCMC1S2 was subsequently used to transform E. coli JM109. Expression was induced by adding 0.2% (w / v) l-rhamnose to the culture (A546 nm ¼ 0.2­0.3) in LB / ampicillin medium. Induction was performed for 6 h at 30 °C. Escherichia coli JM109(pARO569) was used for expression of AtCMLE1. The recombinant strain was grown in 150 mL of LB medium plus chloramphenicol (10 lgÆmL)1) to an A546 nm of 0.5, 1 mm isopropyl thio-b-d-galactoside was added, and the cells were grown until they reached an A546 nm of about 5. Finally, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g using a Beckman Avanti J-25 equipped with JA-10 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) and cell extracts were prepared.

Plasmids and DNA manipulation techniques
Plasmid pBluescript II SK (+) was used for standard cloning experiments [21]. The plasmid vector pJOE3075 was used for high levels of gene expression [22]. Plasmid pARO569 was used for expression of the CMLE from A. tumefaciens CMLE (AtCMLE1). This plasmid contained a KpnI fragment from pARO523 [13] encoding AtCMLE1 under the control of the lac promoter. The plasmid was kindly provided by D. Parke (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The characteristics of all plasmids used are shown in Table 1. Genomic DNA from A. radiobacter S2 was extracted using a `DNeasy Tissue Kit' (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Plasmid DNA from E. coli DH5a was isolated with a GFX Micro Plasmid Prep kit (Amersham-Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Digestion of DNA with restriction endonucleases (MBI Fermentas, St Leon-Rot, Germany), electrophoresis and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (MBI Fermentas) were performed using standard techniques [23]. Transformation of E. coli was performed as in Chung et al. [24]. Oligonucleotides for PCR were custom synthesized (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). PCR mixtures (50 lL) for the amplification of genomic DNA contained 100 pmol of each primer, 0.1­0.2 lg of genomic DNA, 0.1 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, Taq DNA polymerase (2­2.5 U) and the corresponding reaction buffer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Mutations were introduced into pcaB1S2 by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange

ments Inc., Urbana, IL) at 1.1 · 108 Pa. Cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 30 min at 4 °C with a Beckman Optima LE-80K ultracentrifuge equipped with 65.13 rotor (Kontron, Eching, Germany).

Purification of His-tagged ArCMLE1
Cell extracts of E. coli JM109(pSHCMC1S2) were prepared in Tris / HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) as described above. The `Ni­nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow' column material (25 mL; Qiagen) was transferred to an empty 25 mL FPLC chromatography column. The filled column was attached to an FPLC apparatus (Amersham-Pharmacia) and equilibrated with a buffer system (pH 8.0) consisting of 50 mm Tris / HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cell extracts (about 120 mg of protein) were applied to the column, and the column was washed with 1­2 column volumes of the equilibration buffer. ArCMLE1 was then eluted using a buffer system (pH 8.0) consisting of Tris / HCl (50 mm), NaCl (300 mm), dithiothreitol (1 mm), and 150 mm imidazole. Five-milliliter fractions were collected, and the fraction showing enzymatic activity (usually fractions 3 and 4) were used for enzymatic studies and crystallization.

at 280 nm. ArCMLE1 crystallized in two different crystal forms in sitting drops from either 100 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5), 15% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, and 100 mm ammonium sulfate (P21 crystal form), or 100 mm Mes (pH 6.5), 15% poly(ethylene glycol) 8000, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 3% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (P212121 crystal form). The crystallization drop consisted of 1 lL of protein solution (10 mgÆmL)1), 1 lL of 4 mm 3SM and 1 lL of well solution. Crystals appeared after several weeks of incubation at room temperature. For data collection, crystals were quickly dipped in well solution supplemented with 20% glycerol and flash cooled to 100 K in a stream of boil-off nitrogen gas. The P21 and ° ° P212121 crystals diffracted to 2.2 A and 2.6 A resolution, ° respectively. An initial low-resolution dataset (3.2 A) of the P21 form was collected at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg outstation on beamline BW7A. The diffraction quality of the crystals improved over time, and the highest-resolution data were collected from 4-month-old crystals at the European Synchroton Radiation Facility on beamline ID14-3 (Table 2).

Structure solution and refinement
° The structure was initially solved using the 3.2 A data collected at Hamburg on the P21 form with program phaser [29] using a tetrameric model constructed from the previously solved CMLE structure (Protein Data Bank code 1RE5 [6]), including only residues 3­350. phaser was able to locate three tetramers in the asymmetric unit. We used bodil [30] to convert the molecular replacement solution into a rough model of ArCMLE1. Only side chains were replaced, and no further energy minimization was applied before refinement against the experimental data. The structure was refined with cns 1.1 [31], using strict noncrystallographic symmetry constraints between the 12 monomers. This resulted in R-factors of 0.266 for Rwork and 0.284 for Rfree (5% of the reflections). We then used a monomer of this preliminary structure as a model for phaser [29] to ° ° solve the 2.2 A P21 structure. The 2.6 A P212121 structure was solved with molrep [32] from the P21 structure using a refined tetramer as a model. Both the P21 and P212121 structures contain three homotetramers in the asymmetric unit. The higher-resolution structures were refined with refmac [33], and manual model correction was done with coot [34]. Initially, medium NCS restraints were applied between monomers but during the final stages of refinement, the restraints were completely released. Also, during the last refinement cycle, a conservative translation, libration and screw rotation displacement (TLS) refinement was used: each TLS group consisted of a biological tetramer. TLS refinement decreased the R-factors by 1% (Rwork) and 0.4% (Rfree) for the P21 structure and by 1.3 / 0.6% for the P212121 structure. The final R-factors for the models are

Protein analysis and enzyme assays
The protein content of cell-free extracts was determined by Bradford assay [27] with BSA as standard. The purity of the protein preparation was assessed by SDS / PAGE [28], and the gels were routinely stained with Coomassie Blue. In some experiments, the gels were silver stained using a Dodeca Silver Stain Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Enzyme activities were measured with 3CM and 3SM, with the enzymatically synthesized compounds. The activity with 3CM was measured spectrophotometrically at 260 nm using substrate concentrations from 0.01 to 0.6 mm, and the activity with 3SM was measured by HPLC [15]. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 lmol of substrate per minute. Kinetic studies of inhibition by isocitrate and citrate were performed using similar concentrations of 3CM and 5­25 mm inhibitor. All kinetic data were fitted using graphpad prism v4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

Crystallization and data collection
Purified ArCMLE1 was buffer-exchanged into 10 mm Tris / HCl (pH 7.5) plus 1 mm dithiothreitol using a Sephadex G-25 column (PD-10; Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and the protein was concentrated to 20 mgÆmL)1 by ultrafiltration (Centricon, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using a calculated extinction coefficient of 24 040 m)1Æcm)1

18.8 / 23.6% for the P21 and 19.9 / 26.1% for the P212121 structures. The geometry of the models is acceptable (Table 2). The final models for all 12 independent monomers in the P21 asymmetric unit contained residues 2­268 and 281­350; some of the monomers contained either Gly269 (E, G, H, J and K chains) or Gly269-Gly270 (B and F chains) as well. Monomers ABCD, EFGH and IJKL form biological tetramers. For two chains in the P212121 structure, we were able to build even more of the missing loop; chain A contains also residues Gly269-Gly270-Gly271 and Lys279-Gln280, and chain D contains Gly269-Gly270-Gly271 and His278° Lys279-Gln280. At 2.2 A, we were able to build alternative conformations for residues Glu22, Ser63, Asn188 (on the surface) and Leu302 (hydrophobic patch within monomer). Each of the 12 independent monomers contained at least one residue with alternative conformations; no monomer contained all four.

Modeling of A. tumefaciens CMLE
A homology model of AtCMLE was based on the P21 structure of ArCMLE1. The ArCMLE1 monomer A was used as a model in bodil [30], and side chains were changed, and loops and C-terminus truncated according to the sequence alignment. Loop 269­280 was removed from the automatically generated model, as it is not defined in the crystal structures. The biological tetramer was then generated based on the ABCD tetramer of the P21 structure described here.
