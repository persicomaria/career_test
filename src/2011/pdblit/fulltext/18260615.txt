The synthesis, SAR, and preclinical evaluation of 17-cyanated 2-substituted estra-1,3,5(10)-trienes as anticancer agents are discussed. 2-Methoxy-17 -cyanomethylestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol (14), but not the related 2-ethyl derivative 7, and the related 3-O-sulfamates 8 and 15 display potent antiproliferative effects (MCF-7 GI50 300, 60 and 70 nM, respectively) against human cancer cells in vitro. Investigation of the SAR reveals that a sterically unhindered hydrogen bond acceptor attached to C-17 is most likely key to the enhanced activity. Compound 8 displayed significant in vitro antiangiogenic activity, and its ability to act as a microtubule disruptor was confirmed. Inhibitory activity of the sulfamate derivatives against steroid sulfatase and carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) was also observed, and the interaction between 15 and hCAII was investigated by protein crystallography. The potential of these multimechanism anticancer agents was confirmed in vivo, with promising activity observed for both 14 and 15 in an athymic nude mouse MDAMB-231 human breast cancer xenograft model.
Introduction The discovery of angiogenesis inhibitors, which block the formation of new blood vessels required by tumors to support their growth,1 offered a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancer and stimulated extensive research in the area.2 Although a number of potent angiogenesis inhibitors have been discovered, their application as single agent cancer therapies has not shown the hoped for clinical benefits. However, use in combination with conventional cytotoxic agents has produced more encouraging results. This approach, illustrated by the use of bevacizumab,3 a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in combination with chemotherapy has been shown to improve the survival of patients with colorectal,4 lung, and breast cancer.5 The success of this treatment strategy highlights the potential that exists for drugs that can exert an antiangiogenic effect in concert with a second antitumor activity. In previous studies, we detailed the discovery of a number of sulfamoylated 2-substituted estratriene derivatives6­9 that, like the endogenous estrogen metabolite 2-methoxyestradiol (1) (2MeOE2), exhibit antiproliferative activity against cancer cells and also display an antiangiogenic effect.10­13 Although notable mechanistic differences between the 2-substituted estratrieneThe X-ray crystal structure of 15 has been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre as supplementary publication CCDC 658208.

3-O-sulfamates 2 and 3 (Figure 1) and 1 have been reported and are discussed in depth elsewhere,11,14,15 in essence the antitumor effects of both compound series appear to stem from their ability to disrupt normal microtubule dynamics, which arrests the cell cycle and leads the rapidly dividing cancer cells to undergo apoptosis.11 The estratriene sulfamate series is, however, differentiated from the corresponding substituted estradiol derivatives by the enhanced antitumor activity and high oral bioavailability,16 which they display and, additionally, by their ability to inhibit both steroid sulfatase (STSa, irreversibly)17,18 and carbonic anhydrase (CA, reversibly).9,19 STS is a clinical target for the treatment of hormone dependent cancer,20,21 while the carbonic anhydrase IX isoform, which is highly expressed in a number of tumors, has also been proposed as a target for cancer therapy.22 It should be noted that the activities of these 2-substituted estratriene derivatives are independent of the estrogen receptor, toward which they exhibit negligible affinity. They are thought to bind to the colchicine binding site of R-tubulin.9

SAR studies showed that both substitution at C-2 of the steroidal A-ring and an unsubstituted sulfamate group at C-3 are requisite for high antiproliferative activity.6 Optimal activity was conferred by a C-2 ethyl, methylsulfanyl, or methoxy substituent. Although a number of 2-substituted estradiol derivatives displayed antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity,23­25 these nonsulfamoylated molecules are typically much less potent, as illustrated by the mean activities of 1 and 2-methoxyestradiol-3-O-sulfamate (2) (2-MeOE2MATE) across the NCI 60 cell line panel (MGM values of 1.3 µM and 110 nM, respectively).6 This finding is especially significant in light of the extensive evaluation of 1 as an anticancer agent in numerous academic studies and ongoing phase II clinical trials. It would seem that the advantages conferred by the incorporation of the 3-O-sulfamate group are manifold, in that this group affords both enhanced antiproliferative activity and resistance to inactivating conjugation of the C-3 hydroxyl group, to which the corresponding estradiol derivatives are subject. Furthermore, estrogen 3-O-sulfamates are also highly active reversible inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), an enzyme that is highly expressed in red blood cells, through a coordination of the monoanionic form of the sulfamate moiety to the zinc atom in the enzyme active site.26 This interaction is believed to underlie the high oral bioavailability observed for estradiol-3-O-sulfamate (E2MATE) (which is atypical of estrogen derivatives), wherein reversible uptake by red blood cells and interaction with carbonic anhydrase II results in avoidance of first pass liver metabolism,27 and it is plausible to suggest that such a mechanism could well operate advantageously for 2-substituted derivatives of E2MATE. To date, SAR knowledge of these compounds outside the A-ring is limited to variation of the oxidation level of, and/or substitution at, the C-17-position of the estratriene core. 17Hydroxy, 17-keto, and 17-oximino derivatives at C-17 display similar potency, though the 17-deoxy- and 17R-benzyl derivatives exhibit greatly reduced antiproliferative activity.8 An improvement in in vitro antiproliferative activity was achieved by installation of a second O-sulfamate group at C-17, and significantly, this enhanced activity was seen to translate into enhanced in vivo antitumor effects. The C-17 sulfamate group of the 2-substituted estradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamates thus not only provides for greater activity, by presumably exploiting electrostatic interactions at the site of action unavailable to the smaller oxygen functions of the first generation compounds but also serves to block inactivating metabolism and conjugation reactions to which they (especially the 17-hydroxyl derivatives) are subject. Compound 1 has been shown to be rapidly metabolized to inactive 2-methoxyestrone (2-MeOE1) by 17 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (17 -HSD type II), while the 3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate derivatives are not subject to 17 HSD type II metabolism.15 The combination of inactivating metabolism with rapid conjugative inactivation through reaction of the hydroxyl groups, to which 1 is subject, emphasizes the need for molecules with improved pharmacokinetic profiles as well as potency, as amply illustrated by a recent clinical trial where a dose escalation of up to 6 g/day of 1 was used in an attempt to achieve satisfactory plasma concentrations.28,29 Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that 2-methoxyestradiol3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamate (3) (2-MeOE2bisMATE), however, displayed 85% bioavailability on oral dosing and was still detectable after 24 h, while identically dosed 1 was undetectable after just 5 min.16 X-ray crystallography was used to examine the interaction of 2-MeOE2bisMATE with human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) and proved, unexpectedly, that the 17-Osulfamate group of this compound could also interact with the

catalytic zinc of the enzyme active site in a manner analogous to that observed for the 3-O-sulfamate group of E2MATE,9 although interaction also of the 3-O-sulfamate in vivo is not necessarily excluded. Thus, it appears that, in addition to the properties discussed above, the 17-O-sulfamate of 3 may also enhance oral bioavailability by allowing a reversible uptake into red blood cells and through interaction with hCAII affords a mechanism for avoiding first pass liver metabolism. Encouraged by the high activity and excellent pharmacokinetic profile displayed by the compounds such as 3, we explored whether further D-ring modification could afford still greater enhancement in activity. To this end, a series of C-17-carbamate derivatives was synthesized, allowing us to establish that the carbamate function could, in certain cases, successfully function as a bioisostere for the C-17-sulfamate group.30 We were thus also drawn to examine further C-17 functional groups that could serve as hydrogen bond acceptors in the hope of discovering even more active compounds and herein report the discovery of 17-cyano-substituted estra-1,3,5(10)-trienes as compounds that exhibit potent antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity, despite only possessing a single sulfamate group.6 Chemistry Earlier SAR studies demonstrated that a 3-O-sulfamate group is critical for highly potent activity, but that 2-methoxyestradiol17-O-sulfamate is essentially inactive.6,9 We were, therefore, drawn to examine whether the 17-O-sulfamate group of the 2-substituted estradiol-3,17-O,O-bis-sulfamates could be replaced with a small hydrogen bond-accepting group tethered to C-17, reasoning that a sterically smaller functional group might provide enhanced in vitro antiproliferative activity. In order to mimic the distance between the proposed hydrogen bond acceptor and C-17 of the sulfamate group, a two atom linker would be required between C-17 and the H-bond acceptor. We thus decided to install a cyanomethyl group at C-17 since the alkyl linker would afford a reasonable degree of flexibility, and the cyano group should offer sterically unhindered Hbonding interactions through the terminal nitrogen atom. This is clearly illustrated by computational overlay of bis-sulfamate 3 and nitrile compound 15 (vide infra) presented in Figure 2. The close spatial proximity of the nitrile nitrogen and 17-Osulfamate NH2 would suggest that they could function analogously as H-bond acceptors, albeit with differing electronic and steric properties, which might allow the nitrile to interact more strongly with those residues (Asn349 and Val315) around the colchicine binding site of tubulin identified by docking studies as potential H-bond donors to the 17-O-sulfamate group of 3.9

A Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction between TBSprotected 2-ethylestrone 4 and diethylcyanomethyl phosphonate was thus carried out in refluxing THF to give the cyanomethylene derivative 5 in an excellent 94% yield as a mixture of its E- and Z-isomers (Scheme 1). Hydrogenation of the double bond delivered the 17 -alkane 6, which was then desilylated with TBAF in THF to deliver phenol 7. Sulfamoylation of 7 was then achieved by reaction with a solution of sulfamoyl chloride in DMA following the method of Okada and co-workers31 to give sulfamate 8. Desilylation of alkene 5 was also carried out to deliver the phenol as a mixture of the geometric isomers from which the E-alkene 9 could be isolated by chromatography. Sulfamoylation of 9 was then carried out to deliver sulfamate 10. The analogous series of reactions was performed in the 2-methoxy series with 11 being transformed into the respective phenol (14 and 16) and sulfamate (15 and 17) derivatives. An X-ray crystal structure of 15 was obtained and is presented in Figure 3. This structure confirms the -stereochemistry of

the alkyl substituent C-17 and confirms that the integrity of the chiral centers of the estra-1,3,5(10)-triene core are retained throughout the synthesis. Intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the sulfamate NH2 group and both the nitrile of crystallographically adjacent 15 and acetone (the crystallization solvent) molecules is observed. The X-ray crystal structure of 2-methoxyestrone-3-O-sulfamate showed no such intermolecular interaction, with the sulfamate appearing instead to hydrogen bond to the adjacent methoxy group in an intramolecular fashion.6 The appearance of intra or intermolecular hydrogen bonding may simply derive from the choice of crystallization solvent. To assess whether the presence of a second cyano group would be beneficial, the (dicyano)methylene and (dicyano)methyl derivatives of 2-ethylestrone were synthesized (Scheme 2). Condensation of 4 with malononitrile in the presence -alanine was thus carried out. Although this reaction proved relatively slow, requiring the addition of extra aliquots of malononitrile after 24 and 48 h, the yield of 18, however (91%), proved excellent. Sequential desilylation of 18 and sulfamoylation afforded phenol 19 and sulfamate 20, respectively. Reduction of the -17 double bond of estratetraene 18 was achieved with sodium borohydride in THF/MeOH to give 21,

which was then converted to phenol 22 and sulfamate 23 as described above. In order to study further steric effects around C-17, we were drawn to methylate 6 at C-20. After some investigation, it was determined that deprotonation of the C-20 methylene group could be achieved with 2.2 equivalents of LDA in THF at -78 °C with methyl iodide quench delivering C-20 monomethyl compound 24 in good yield (Scheme 3). Attempts to introduce a gem-dimethyl group in a one pot procedure directly from 6 or by lithiation and electrophilic quench of 24, however, proved abortive, and we thus decided to inspect an alternate approach to compounds with alkyl substituted side chains. Reaction of benzyl protected 2-ethylestrone 25 with the lithio-anion of propionitrile afforded the 17R-alkylated estradiol derivative 26 in reasonable 76% yield, which could then be dehydrated with methanesulfonic acid/triethylamine to give a 95:5 mixture of the -17 and -16 dehydration products with the former, 27, being isolated by column chromatography as a single isomer (Z-stereochemistry as assigned by NOE experiments) in 85% yield. Dehydration of 26 with Burgess reagent32 delivered spectroscopically identical material. Concurrent debenzylation and double bond hydrogenation delivered 17 -(1-cyano)ethyl phenol (28), which was then sulfamoylated to give 29. Reaction of the lithio-anion of isobutyronitrile with benzyl estrone was performed to test the approach to C-20 gem-dimethyl target compounds, and though this reaction proved successful, dehydration of the product alcohol proved intractable. To confirm whether the activities observed for the nitrile series (vide infra) were attributable to their H-bond acceptor capabilities, the isosteric 17 -prop-2-ynyl compound 32 was synthesized (Scheme 4). DIBALH reduction of the nitrile group of 6 was thus carried out to give the aldehyde 30 in reasonable 61% yield, which could then be reacted with Ohira's reagent33 to afford the 3-hydroxy alkyne 31, as the phenolic TBS group proved unstable to the conditions of the reaction. The desired sulfamate 32 was then formed by reaction with sulfamoyl chloride in DMA. To assess the effects of direct linkage of the nitrile group to C-17 the cyanohydrin 34 was formed by reaction of 2-ethyl3-O-acetyl estrone 33 with potassium cyanide over 5 days at room temperature (Scheme 5). Dehydration of the cyanohydrin with thionyl chloride in refluxing pyridine gave the -16 product

35, which could then be deprotected and sulfamoylated to give 40 or hydrogenated to give the 17 -cyano derivative 36, which was then converted to phenol 37 and sulfamate 38 derivatives, as previously described. Results and Discussion As a first stage predictor of antitumor activity, compounds were assayed for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of a panel of cancer cell lines in vitro. All compounds were screened against DU-145 cells, a human androgen receptor negative (AR-) prostate cancer cell line. The majority of compounds were additionally screened for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells (human breast cancer estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and estrogen receptor negative (ER-), respectively). The results obtained from this in vitro screening are presented in Table 1. The first striking result in the table is the activity of the 2-methoxy-17-cyanomethyl estra-1,3,5(10)-trien-3-ol (14), which is 2.5-fold more potent against the proliferation of DU-145 cells and ca. 8-fold

more potent against the proliferation of both breast cancer cell lines than 1. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time substitution at C-17 alone has provided such an enhancement in antiproliferative activity with respect to the corresponding 17-hydroxy compound, although derivatives of 1 bearing unsaturation in the D-ring, notably the 14-dehydro derivative, have been reported to have significantly enhanced effects on cancer cell proliferation.34 In comparison, the corresponding 17O-sulfamate derivative of 1 proved less active than 1 with a GI50 of >10 µM.9 Interestingly, the corresponding 2-ethyl substituted phenol 7 though 5-10-fold less active than 14, was found to be 4-fold more active than 2-ethylestradiol 41 against DU-145 cells, thus mirroring the beneficial effects of the C-17 cyanomethyl group on antiproliferative activity in the phenol series, an effect that could potentially be used to provide for further enhanced activity if used in conjunction with C-2 substituents, which are reported to deliver enhanced activity in the estradiol series. The 17-(E)-cyanomethylene functionalized phenols 9 and 16, in contrast, displayed no significant activity, a result that suggests that rotation around the C-17-C-20 bond is required to allow either optimal electrostatic interaction or minimize disfavorable steric effects. The 3-O-sulfamate derivatives bearing the 17-cyanomethyl group in both the 2-methoxy 15 and 2-ethyl 8 series proved to be exceptionally potent being, in DU-145 cells, 5.5- and 3.5fold more active than the 2-methoxy- and 2-ethyl-E2bisMATE compounds (3 and 42, respectively), which they were designed to mimic. The effects of 15 and 8 against breast cancer cell proliferation were similarly profound with 50% growth inhibition obtained in the low nanomolar range. As observed in the phenol series, the 3-O-sulfamoylated 2-methoxy 17 and 2-ethyl 10 compounds bearing a C-17 cyanomethylene group were less potent than the corresponding cyanomethyl compounds, with activities against MCF-7 proliferation reduced by 4- and 8-fold,

respectively, presumably reflecting the inability of the rigid 17substituent of these compounds to attain optimal geometry at the site of action. The activities of the remaining compounds in the series serve to characterize the spatial and electronic requirements for high activity. Introduction of a second cyano substituent on the C-17 tethered alkyl group resulted in a slight reduction in antiproliferative activity in the case of both phenol 22 and sulfamate 23, albeit 23 is of a similar potency to the corresponding bissulfamate 42. Introduction of a second H-bond acceptor group thus appears only to hinder the key interaction between the C-17 functionality and the site of action. Introduction of a methylsubstituent on the nitrile substituted carbon 29 caused a reduction in activity similar to that effected by the additional nitrile of 23, which would suggest that the increased steric bulk around the hydrogen bond acceptor interferes with attainment of the optimal conformation at the site of action. The rigid dicyanoalkene substitution gave a significant decrease in activity in the phenol series 19, although sulfamate 20 was essentially equipotent with the corresponding alkane 23. As we had anticipated, alkyne 32 wherein the hydrogen bond acceptor nitrogen of 8 is replaced with with a CH group proved 30-fold less active than the nitrile compound, thus strongly supporting the postulate that the hydrogen bond acceptor group is essential for high antiproliferative activity. By extension, this supports our conclusions on the function of the C-17 sulfamate, principally as a hydrogen bond acceptor, in the bis-sulfamate series. Shortening of the linker group between C-17 and the hydrogen bond acceptor was also found to be deleterious to antiproliferative activity with a 6-fold reduction in activity observed for the 17 -nitrile derivative 38 relative to the corresponding 17-cyanomethyl compound 8. The -16 unsaturated derivatives proved to be essentially inactive as both phenol 39 and sulfamate 40. Thus, it can be seen that C-17 cyanomethyl substitution of 2-substituted estra[1,3,5]-triene-3-O-sulfamates affords a series of molecules with enhanced in vitro antiproliferative activity relative to the C-17 sulfamate series. An enhancement in activity is also evident in the nonsulfamoylated series with 7 and 14 found to be more potent than the corresponding estradiol derivatives. The 3-O-sulfamates 8 and 15 are the most potent 2-substituted estra[1,3,5]-triene-3-O-sulfamates discovered to date, with 15 proving to be up to 33-fold more active than 1 in vitro. Substitution, or deletion, of the CH2 linker between C-17 and the nitrile group results in reduced activity, while replacement of the hydrogen bond-accepting nitrile group of 8 with an isosteric ethynyl group (compound 32) results in a 30-fold reduction in activity and a more than 40-fold reduction for the unsulfamoylated pair 7 and 31. On the evidence of these results, it appears that the C-17 cyanomethyl substituent most likely affords enhanced antiproliferative activity by functioning as a sterically unhindered hydrogen bond acceptor group, even in the simple 2-methoxyestradiol analogue series, which is positioned at the appropriate distance from C-17 in the biological site of action. A number of the novel 17-cyanomethyl derivatives were screened for antiproliferative activity by the NCI in their 60cell line assay (Table 2).35,36 Unfortunately, the most active compounds in the series, 8 and 15, were not selected by the NCI for evaluation, though the relative activities of compounds 23 and 29 compare favorably with both 1 and 3, for which comparative data are included. Compounds 23 and 29 caused >50% growth inhibition in the majority of cell lines at concentrations below 10 nM, with mean growth inhibition (MGM) of 30 and 22 nM, respectively (an MGM of 10 nM is

maximal in this case because of the range of concentrations (10 nM to 100 µM) tested and would be achieved only if 50% growth inhibition was observed in all 60 cell lines at 10 nM). The 17-cyanomethyl compounds were thus seen to show slightly greater activity than 3 and are, notably, 40-fold more active than 1 across the NCI panel. In comparison, sulfamates 40 and 38, whose cyano-groups are directly linked to C-17, showed greatly reduced activity, while 37, the nonsulfamoylated analogue of 38, showed no activity. These NCI results confirm the activity observed in our preliminary screens and, furthermore, demonstrate the effects of these compounds against a wide range of cancer phenotypes. To assess potential antiangiogenic activity, the compounds were assayed for the ability to inhibit the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The IC50 values obtained for 1, 3, and 15 against HUVEC proliferation were 523, 44, and 30 nM, respectively.37 It can thus be seen that the sulfamate derivatives express their in vitro antiangiogenic effects at far lower concentrations than 1. Compound 8 was also assayed for antiangiogenic activity in an in vitro model of angiogenesis, wherein endothelial cells cocultured in a matrix of human dermal fibroblasts are used to assess antiangiogenic potential (Figure 4). When stimulated with VEGF, the endothelial cells proliferate and migrate through the matrix to form tubule-like structures

(see Figure 4b) and the extent of tubule formation can be quantified as described elsewhere.12 As can be seen in Figure 4a, treatment with 20 and 40 nM concentrations of 8 almost completely inhibits the formation of tubule-like structures. Quantification carried out by calculating total pixel length (Figure 4a) reflects the lack of tubule formation, which can be clearly seen in the images of the treated and untreated wells (Figure 4b). We have recently shown that the in vitro antiangiogenic effects of the sulfamoylated 2-substituted estratriene compounds translate well into in vivo activity with compounds including 15 showing impressive activity upon oral administration in mouse Matrigel plug assay for angiogenic activity.13 We have previously established that the antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities of the 2-substituted estratriene-3-Osulfamates are derived from their ability to disrupt normal microtubule dynamics11 and wished to confirm that the 17cyanomethyl series was acting, as we anticipated, at this target. We thus inspected the effects of 8 on the taxol stimulated polymerization of tubulin (10 µM Taxol and 20 µM 8). As can be seen in Figure 5, 8 causes a substantial inhibition of both the rate and extent of microtubule formation stimulated by Taxol, thus supporting the postulate that these compounds, as in previously studied 2-substituted estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-Osulfamates and the related estradiol derivatives, act as micro-

Figure 5. Compound 8 disrupts microtubule dynamics. The ability of compound 8 to inhibit paclitaxel-stimulated tubulin stabilization was assessed. In vitro tubulin assembly was measured by turbidity at 350 nm. Tubulin was preincubated with or without compound 8 (10 µM) for 5 min at 37 °C. Tubulin assembly was then stimulated by adding paclitaxel (10 µM). The change in the absorbance was continuously monitored at 350 nm for 15 min at 37 °C.

tubule disruptors. No further investigation on the interaction of these novel ligands with tubulin has yet been made, although it is notable that these ligands, like the previously studied broadly similar 2-substituted estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-O-sulfamates, which have been observed to bind tubulin in a competitive manner to radio-labeled colchicine, destabilize the polymerization of tubulin.11,37 Having determined that the 17-cyanomethyl compounds act against cancer cell proliferation in vitro, we assayed the compounds for activity against both STS and carbonic anhydrase. It was thought unlikely that the 17 -cyanomethyl substituent would have a profound effect on STS inhibitory activity since the key pharmacophore for inhibition of this enzyme is the phenolic sulfamate group, with activity most strongly influenced by the steric and electronic environment around C-3. Compound 15 was evaluated for its ability to inhibit the STS mediated conversion of tritiated E1S to E1 in placental microsomes.38 An IC50 of 130 nM was obtained, thus confirming that 17-cyanomethyl substitution has little detrimental effect on STS inhibitory activity relative to the analogous 17-hydroxy compound, 2-MeOE2MATE (2) (16 nM), or the 17-O-sulfamate compound, 2-MeOE2bisMATE (3) (39 nM). The 2-ethyl compound 8 was found to be less active as an STS inhibitor with an IC50 of 1.4 ( 0.4 µM, reflecting the lower activity generally observed for 2-ethyl compounds as inhibitors seen in previous studies.6,9 It is thus evident that in addition to their other anticancer activities, molecules such as 15, by functioning as inhibitors of STS, could act against hormone dependent cancers by lowering the levels of circulatory estrogen that stimulate their growth. The ability of estrogen-3-O-sulfamates to reversibly inhibit carbonic anhydrase is well established, with the key interaction being the coordination of the monoanionic form of the sulfamate to the zinc ion of the active site. This reversible interaction of phenolic sulfamates with carbonic anhydrase II could potentially allow an estratriene sulfamate derivative the advantage of sequestration by red blood cells in vivo and consequent avoidance of first pass liver metabolism.27 Compound 15 was thus assayed for inhibitory activity against CAII and was found to have an IC50 value of 1.5 µM against this enzyme. The activity of 15 is thus approximately 4-fold lower than the activity of a number of 2-substituted estratriene-3-O-sulfamate derivatives (e.g., 2-methoxyestrone-3-O-sulfamate (2-MeOEMATE), IC50 of 376 nM and 3, IC50 of 379 nM) and also 3-fold less active than 2-methoxyestradiol-17-O-sulfamate (2MeOE2­17MATE, IC50 of 526 nM), which possesses a less acidic alkyl sulfamate group. The detrimental effects of

2-substitution on CA inhibitory effects are known, as estrone3-O-sulfamate (IC50 42nM) is 8-fold more active than 2-MeOEMATE,19 and o-bromination of even a simple aryl monosulfamate reduces CAII binding from 27 to 137 nM.39 This reflects, presumably, simple steric constraints close to the sulfamate binding region of the CAII active site. However, we had not previously observed that a 17-substituent, which we would expect to occupy the large lipophilic pocket above the enzyme active site, could have such an effect on inhibitory activity. We were thus drawn to further explore the interaction of 15 with hCAII to see if we could elucidate the origins of the effect of the C-17 substituent. As can been seen in Figure 6b, the sulfamate NH of 15 coordinates to the catalytic zinc ion (NsZn2+ ) 2.08 Å) of the enzyme active site displacing the hydroxide ion present in the active site of the uninhibited enzyme. The zinc ion is also coordinated to three histidine residues (His94, His96, and His119) with an overall tetrahedral geometry. Two hydrogen bonds between the sulfamate and Thr 199 through their respective NH and O groups (see Figure 6b) are also apparent, with the steroid nucleus lying in the hydrophobic part of the active site pocket. The presence of the 2-substituent has previously proved to be detrimental to CAII inhibitory activity, and it would thus appear that groups at the 2-position render the interaction between the sulfamate group and the zinc atom less favorable through steric hindrance with the proximal residues of the active site. It is not, however, readily apparent from this structure why 15 should be 4-fold less active than either 2-MeOEMATE or 3 as an inhibitor of CAII. The electron density around C-17 is ill defined in this structure, presumably reflecting the rotational freedom of the cyanomethyl group and in turn the absence of substantial energetically beneficial or detrimental interactions with the protein at this site. The structure of 3/hCAII did contrast to that of 15 in two respects, namely, the unexpected coordination of the C-17 sulfamate to the catalytic zinc and the presence of a second binding site for the ligand, not observed in the 15/hCAII structure. Given the small difference in inhibitory activity of the respective 3- and 17-Osulfamate derivatives of 1 (376 and 526 nM), we believe that the bis-sulfamate derivative can bind through both of its sulfamate groups and that the crystal structure only reflected one of these modes. The presence of a second binding site (ca. 60% occupancy) may, however, be more relevant since it could be possible that the nitrile substituted compound 15 has lower, or negligible affinity, for this second site, thus resulting in a lower overall affinity between the ligand and enzyme and consequently a reduced inhibitory activity. Given the large size of the pocket above the enzyme active site, it may be possible that occupation of both of the ligand binding sites identified in the 3/hCAII structure is required for high activity. Even with a protein crystal structure, it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion on the origin of the reduced inhibitory activity of 15 against hCAII relative to other 2-substituted estratriene sulfamate derivatives. In order to evaluate this class of compounds for in vivo antitumor activity, it was decided to test 2-methoxy-17cyanomethyl estratriene-3-O-sulfamate (15) and the corresponding 3-hydroxy compound 14 for their ability to inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 xenografts in female nude athymic mice (n ) 6). The compounds were dosed orally once daily over a period of 28 days as a solution in THF/PG (10%/90%) at doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg (15) and 120 mg/kg (14). As can be seen in Figure 7, promising inhibition of tumor growth was achieved with both compounds. The higher 80 mg/kg dose of sulfamate 15 proved

the same model, caused tumor regression, although it is 4-fold less potent than 15 in vitro. The difference in in vitro and in vivo activities observed for 15 and 3 may derive from a number of factors. The formulation used for this study has not been rigorously investigated, and we have no information on the oral bioavailability achieved for 15. It may also be that the nitrile group of 15 is subject to rapid metabolism, a factor that could lead to inactivation or accelerated clearance. In contrast, pharmacokinetic studies have shown that 3 displays high oral bioavailability in rodents (>85%) and does not undergo significant metabolism. As noted above, the relative inhibitory activity of 15 for carbonic anhydrase is 4-fold less than that observed for 3, and this could possibly result in increased exposure to metabolism for 15 relative to the bis-sulfamate. It is thus clear that, although promising in vivo activity has been observed for 15, pharmacokinetic studies would be highly advantageous to establish the in vivo fate of the compound and could direct the development of an enhanced formulation or further structural modification to block potential metabolism. Nevertheless, the structural modification intrinsic to 15 is clearly worthy of further investigation, particularly that for 14, given the problems already noted with 2-MeOE2. Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered that a number of 17cyanomethyl functionalized 2-substituted estra-1,3,5(10)-triene derivatives display high activity against the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro. Enhanced activity is observed in both the 3-hydroxy and 3-O-sulfamoyl series of compounds, although as observed in previous studies, the sulfamoylated compounds display the most potent antiproliferative effects. SAR studies defined that the C-17 cyanomethyl group most likely functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor and that substitution of the methylene linker between the nitrile and C-17, presumably due to steric factors, is deleterious to activity. Direct linkage of the nitrile group to C-17 and replacement of the nitrile group or replacement an isosteric ethynyl group caused a great reduction in activity. Antiproliferative activity against a wide range of hormone dependent and independent cancer cells was observed, and it appears that this activity, as with previously studied 2-substituted estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-O-sulfamates, stems from their ability to interfere with the dynamics of tubulin polymerization. The sulfamate compounds showed activity against the proliferation of HUVECs and in an in vitro model of angiogenesis. Furthermore, the antiangiogenic profiles of these compounds in vivo has recently been established.13 In addition,

more effective than the 40 mg/kg dose, with growth inhibitions of 66% and 34% being achieved, respectively. Dosing with the phenol 14, albeit at the higher 120 mg/kg dose, caused a 44% inhibition of tumor growth. No toxic effects were observed at these dose levels (data not shown). A dose dependent inhibition of tumor growth was thus observed with 15 treatment, while significant activity was observed with 14 treatment. The relative in vivo activities were found to correlate with their relative in vitro activities. It is notable that 15 proved less active than the corresponding bis-sulfamate, 2-MeOE2bisMATE 3 which, in

activity of the sulfamoylated molecules against two tumor relevant enzymes, namely, steroid sulfatase (a clinical target for the treatment of HDBC) and carbonic anhydrase was observed. The interaction of 15 with carbonic anhydrase was studied by protein crystallography revealing, as expected, coordination of the 3-O-sulfamate group to the catalytic zinc of the hCAII active site. Confirmation of the potential of these molecules for development as anticancer agents was demonstrated by the significant growth inhibition achieved on treatment of human breast cancer xenografts in mice with two of the novel compounds being orally bioavailable. Further development of antitumor agents based on structural modification of 2-MeOE2 is presently underway. Experimental Procedures
Materials and Methods. Chemistry. All chemicals were either purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. (Gillingham, U.K.), Fluka (Gillingham, U.K.) or Lancaster Synthesis (Morecambe, U.K.). Organic solvents of A.R. grade were supplied by Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, U.K.) and used as supplied. Anhydrous N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) were purchased from Aldrich and stored under positive pressure of N2 after use. THF was distilled from sodium with benzophenone indicator. Sulfamoyl chloride was prepared by an adaptation of the method of Appel and Berger40 and was stored in the refrigerator under positive pressure of N2 as a solution in toluene as described by Woo et al.41 An appropriate volume of this solution was freshly concentrated in vacuo immediately before use. Estrone was purchased from Sequoia Research Products (Oxford, U.K.). Reactions were carried out at room temperature (rt) unless otherwise stated. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel (MatrexC60). 1 H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with a Varian Mercury VX400 NMR spectrometer at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, and chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm, ) relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded at the Mass Spectrometry Service Center, University of Bath, U.K. or at the EPSRC National Mass Spectrometry service, Swansea. FAB-MS was carried out using m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA) as the matrix. Elemental analyses were performed by Microanalysis Service, University of Bath. Melting points were determined using a Reichert-Jung Thermo Galen Kofler block and are uncorrected. Biology. The effects of compounds on MCF-7, DU-145 and MDA MB-231 cell growth were determined using a microtiter plate assay as described previously.6,30 STS inhibition was assayed by the method of Purohit et al.,38 and carbonic anhydrase inhibition was carried out as described elsewhere.19 The effects of compound 8 on in vitro polymerization of purified bovine brain tubulin (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) were measured by turbidometry using a previously validated assay.11,37 Tubulin (1 mg/mL) in MES buffer (0.1 M MES at pH 6.5, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 M monosodium glutamate, and 1 mM GTP) was preincubated with or without test compounds (10 µM, 1% v/v ethanol) for 5 min at 37 °C. Tubulin assembly was then stimulated by adding paclitaxel (10 µM). The change in the absorbance was continuously monitored at 350 nm for 15 min at 37 °C. Because the amount of tubulin polymerized is directly proportional to the area under the curve (AUC), it was used to determine the extent of tubulin polymerization by different test compounds. The AUC of paclitaxel alone, with a maximal extent of polymerization, was set to 100% polymerization. In Vivo Efficacy Studies. Female MF-1 nu/nu mice from Harlan (Bicester, Oxon, U.K.) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the flank with 2 × 106 MDA-MB-231 cells, which resulted in a single tumor per animal. All experiments were carried out under conditions that complied with institutional guidelines. Daily oral administration of 15 (40 and 80 mg/kg) and 14 (120 mg/kg) was initiated when the tumors reached approximately 100­150 mm3 in volume. Dosing was performed for 28 days. Animal weights and tumor measure-

ments were taken weekly using electronic callipers. Tumor volume (V), in mm3, was determined using the following equation: length × width2/2 (l × w2/2). Protein Crystallography. The hCA II-15 complex was obtained by adding a 5-molar excess of the inhibitor to a 10 mg/mL protein solution in 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. Crystals of the complex were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at 20 °C. The drops were prepared by mixing 2 µL of the complex solution and 2 µL of the precipitant solution containing 2.8 M (NH4)2SO4, 300 mM sodium chloride in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), and 1 mM dithiothreitol to improve the crystal quality. A complete data set was collected at 1.85 Å resolution from a single crystal of about 0.2 mm × 0.3 mm × 0.3 mm. Data collection was carried out at Synchrotron source Elettra in Trieste, using a Mar CCD detector. The crystal belonged to the P21 space group with unit cell parameters a ) 42.17 Å, b ) 41.49 Å, c ) 71.58 Å, and ) 104.07°. Diffracted intensities were processed using the HKL crystallographic data reduction package (Denzo/Scalepack).42 A total of 59499 reflections was measured and reduced to 20038 unique reflections. Crystal parameters and data processing statistics are summarized in tabular form in the Supporting Information. The structure of the complex was analyzed by difference Fourier techniques, using the PDB file 1CA243 as a starting model for refinement. Water molecules were removed from the starting model prior to structure factor and phase calculations. The inspection of the Fourier maps, calculated with 3Fo - 2Fc and Fo - Fc coefficients, revealed prominent electron density features in the active site region. After an initial refinement limited to the enzyme structure, a model for the inhibitor was easily built and introduced into the atomic coordinates set for further refinement, which proceeded to convergence with continuous map inspections and model updates. The refinement was carried out with the program CNS,44 and model building and map inspections were performed using the O program.45 The final model contains 2068 protein atoms, 28 inhibitor atoms, and 292 water molecules, and has Rfactor and Rfree values of 17.0 and 20.3%, respectively. The correctness of stereochemistry was finally checked using PROCHECK.46 The statistics for refinement are summarized in the Supporting Information.
