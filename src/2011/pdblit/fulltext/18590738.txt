Conservation of Salt Bridges in Protein Families
Ora Schueler and Hanah Margalit*
Department of Molecular Genetics, Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School POB 12272, Jerusalem 91120 Israel A detailed computational analysis is presented that focuses on the relationship between structural attributes and the degree and mode of salt bridge conservation. A data set of conserved and non-conserved salt bridges was constructed from eight protein families, based on the structural alignment of family members. Salt bridges were defined at the secondary structure level rather than at the residue level, implying different possible modes of conservation: preservation (same charges at the same residue positions), compensation (reversal of charges), and complementation (maintenance of a salt bridge between two segments of secondary structures, not involving the same residue positions). Structural attributes such as the surface accessibility, distance from the active site, or type of secondary structures involved, were studied. No significant differences were found between conserved and non-conserved salt bridges, except for the surface accessibility. Conserved salt bridges were shown to be less exposed than non-conserved ones. Moreover, within the set of conserved salt bridges, the degree of conservation was shown to negatively correlate with surface exposure; however, not to an extent that could indicate a general role for electrostatic interactions in the protein interior. Examination of the most conserved salt bridge in each family showed a variety of typical features: Some involved the terminal segments of the protein, some were buried and one involved the catalytic site of the protein. Hence, the role of salt bridges is more specific, probably in fine tuning of a specific structure through the folding process or in determining the functional site. As for the conservation mode, preservations were found to predominate in the conserved interactions, while complementations were of secondary importance. Compensations occurred only rarely and mostly in exposed salt bridges, suggesting that this mechanism is not utilized frequently and especially not in important interactions.

Introduction
The role that particular residues play in the determination of the structure and function of a protein can be studied either by examining the effect of substitutions or by comparing sequences or structures of proteins in a family and following the distribution of amino acid residues in positions of interest. Both approaches, the experimental and the computational, are essentially equivalent, as both identify the range of allowed amino acid residues in a position, and accordingly determine the importance of that position. Positions where substitutions of different characteristics are tolerated are equivalAbbreviations used: PDB, protein data bank; DHFR, dehydrofolate reductase.

ent to positions that are non-conserved in a protein family. These are postulated to play an unessential role. On the other hand, conserved positions are believed to play important roles regarding the structure and function of the protein. Studies based on these approaches have revealed basic principles of protein structure, such as the conservation of hydrophobic residues in the protein core (see e.g. Bordo & Argos, 1990; Lesk & Chothia, 1980; Lim & Sauer, 1989; Rennell et al., 1991; Markiewicz et al., 1994), or important conserved features regarding the protein functional site (see e.g. Lesk & Chothia, 1980; Rennell et al., 1991). While the role of hydrophobic residues in the determination of a stable structure was defined explicitly, the contribution of electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) to protein stability has not been

Clearly, buried charged residues involved in salt bridges are favorable over isolated charges, yet they destabilize the protein in comparison to hydrophobic interactions. Even more doubtful is the role of exposed salt bridges, which comprise the majority. Substitution studies did not reveal any significant influence of those on protein stability (Dao-pin et al., 1991; Sali et al., 1991), and showed that the micro-environment considerably influences the strength and significance of a salt bridge. Why then are some of the salt bridges conserved in a protein family? This study attempts to identify structural characteristics of conserved salt bridges that may aid in understanding their maintenance in several members of a family and their general role. A previous computational study of three protein families showed that salt bridges are poorly conserved, unless they concern the catalytic activity of the protein or reside in a family of very similar sequences (Barlow & Thornton, 1983). In the present analysis the degree of conservation of a salt bridge is calculated by a measure that takes into account the sequence similarity, preventing any possible bias by this factor. The study is based on structural alignments of eight protein families. For each family, all salt bridges were screened, and conserved salt bridges were defined. Since protein families tend to be more conserved on the structural rather than on the sequence level (Chothia & Lesk, 1986), we decided to address the question of salt bridge conservation similarly. Accordingly, two salt bridges in two proteins in a family were considered as equivalent not only if they involved the same

residues in the alignment, but also when they connected the same two elements of secondary structure. Our data set, which included a reasonably large number of salt bridges, could be used for statistical analyses attempting to identify differences between conserved and non-conserved salt bridges regarding various structural attributes. Distinct characteristics that are found in conserved salt bridges may explain the general significance of such interactions to protein structure and/or function.

Results
General statistics Figure 1 illustrates the major steps of the analysis. For each protein listed in Table 1 all its salt bridges were defined. Examination of their frequency in the eight protein families immediately suggested that there is no uniformity in their appearance. The average number of salt bridges per protein over the whole data set is 6 (standard deviation = 3), yet, there is a large variation within a family and between families. From Table 1 it is clear that there are protein families like the globins, DHFR, and the nucleotide binding proteins which contain a large number of salt bridges, and families like the cytochrome c's with a few salt bridges only. In order to verify that these differences do not just reflect the variation in sequence lengths, we calculated a normalized measure. For each protein, the number of residues participating in salt bridges was counted

and normalized by the sequence length. The last column of Table 1 gives an average value of this measure for each family. As shown, the length consideration may explain the relatively high number of salt bridges in nucleotide binding proteins and acid proteases, but cannot account for the high number of salt bridges found in globins and DHFRs or their scarcity in cytochrome c's. Similar results were obtained when normalizing by the protein surface area (data not shown). In this study, salt bridges in protein families were defined by higher structural levels and not by interacting residues per se. Thus, salt bridges in different proteins of a family that connect respective segments by equivalent or different residues defined one non-single salt bridge. Salt bridges involving equivalent residues positioned in a segment adjacent to the segment under consideration were not treated separately but were also included within this non-single (intersegmental) salt bridge. As exemplified for the globin family in Figure 2, there are salt bridges, as 1 and 2, with representatives from many family members, but also salt bridges of one representative only. The utility of classifying the salt bridges by the segments involved can best be illustrated by salt bridge number 2, where helices B and G are connected by salt bridges that involve close, but not identical positions in different proteins. The classification of salt bridges in each family by higher order structures led us to inspect the fraction of segments that are involved in salt bridges. Analysis of the pooled data revealed that 59% of all

segments are engaged in salt bridges. Indeed, for most families this value is about 60%, except for the globins where all segments but one participate in salt bridges, and the acid protease family with only one third of the segments forming salt bridges (Figure 3(a)). This indicates that regardless of the number or frequency of the residues involved in salt bridges, in most protein families they are distributed in about half of the segments only. The pooled data can also be examined for different types of segments. The fraction of a-helices that are engaged in salt bridges out of all a-helices is twice as large as that observed in b-strands (Figure 3(b)). This result is not due to the high frequency of salt bridges in the globin family and the fact that it does not contain b-strands, but holds also when the globin family is excluded. It may suggest that the participation of salt bridges in interactions that involve a-helices is more favorable than in the other types of segments. (Note that the low fraction of salt bridges in b structures may result from the consideration of strands rather than sheets, and therefore the conclusions are restricted to b-strands only.) Analysis of conservation As summarized in Table 2, a large fraction (60%) of all salt bridges are single ones, indicating that many are specific for a particular protein and do not reflect a structural role for the whole protein family. A salt bridge that appears in more than one family member (a non-single salt bridge) may suggest a

JMB--MS 414 128 more general role, either at the family level or at a basic level of protein structure determination. Our approach was to extract attributes from the three-dimensional structures of the proteins and examine their correlation with salt bridge conservation. As the extent of conservation varies among

different salt bridges, we developed a quantitative measure of conservation, C, that consists of the fraction of family representatives with a particular salt bridge divided by their average sequence similarity (see Methods). By including the average sequence similarity in the expression of C, a higher

Figure 2. Identification of salt bridges in the globin family. The 87 salt bridges from the 12 proteins of the family are classified by the segments they connect, making a total of 27 different salt bridges. The names of the segments are indicated in upper case letters, A to H. A lower case h, preceding the segment's name indicates a helix. For loops, two upper case letters describe their location relative to the helices, e.g. CD lies between the helices hC and hD. A dot indicates the end of the sequence. The 27 distinct salt bridges are framed. Non-single salt bridges are numbered from 1 to 16, according to decreasing C-value, and single salt bridges are numbered from 17 to 27. Within a framed salt bridge the protein(s) containing this salt bridge and the positions involved are indicated. Proteins are numbered in the order they appear in Table 1: 1, 4hhb A; 2, 4hhb B; 3, 2mhb A; 4, 2mhb B; 5, 1fdh G; 6, 1mbd; 7, 1mbs; 8, 2lhb; 9, 1eca; 10, 2lh1; 11, 1pmb A; 12, 1mba; and the positions are numbered as in the structural alignment. For example, 10 126 154 represents protein 2lh1 which contains a salt bridge between positions 126 and 154, connecting the helices hG and hH. Note that in the few cases where equivalent residues in different proteins are located in adjacent segments they are also classified with the adjacent salt bridge. For example, AB­hG (2 25 140) was also classified as salt bridge 3. Compensations are bold.

weight is given to salt bridges that are conserved in less similar sequences in comparison to salt bridges that are conserved in very similar sequences. The distribution of C values in the non-single salt bridges around their median of 0.63 is depicted in Figure 4. Each salt bridge was described by several attributes (as detailed for the globin family in Table 3): (1) conservation degree (C); (2) surface accessibility; (3) distance from active site; (4) intersegmental or intrasegmental; (5) types of segments involved. The analyses were carried out in three steps: firstly, conserved and non-conserved salt bridges (non-single and single salt bridges, respectively) were compared; secondly, correlations with the conservation degree were estimated within the non-single salt bridges; and thirdly, the most conserved salt bridge in each family was characterized. For the two quantitative attributes, accessibility and distance from active site, a correlation coefficient with C was calculated. The two other attributes, characterization of the salt bridges as inter- or intrasegmental and type of segment involved, are qualitative, and the relationship between those and C was evaluated by a x2 test. When comparing the surface accessibility of single salt bridges with that of non-single ones in the pooled data set, a significantly higher average accessibility was obtained in the group of single salt bridges in comparison to the non-single ones, suggesting that salt bridges with some degree of conservation tend

to be more buried (P < 0.03; by a one tailed t-test. Surface accessibility of non-single salt bridges: mean = 36.16, standard deviation = 16.04, sample size = 65; accessibility of single salt bridges: mean = 41.26, standard deviation = 17.47, sample size = 96). To check whether there is a linear correlation between the degree of conservation and accessibility, the coefficient of correlation between accessibility values and C values was calculated for all 65 non-single salt bridges. We found a negative correlation (r = -0.24) which is statistically significant (P < 0.05; one tailed t-test), again pointing to a tendency of more conserved salt bridges to be less exposed. Because the active sites defined for different families vary in their nature, it was inappropriate to analyze this measure for the pooled data set, but for each family separately. The small sample sizes of salt bridges in the individual families necessitated the use of non-parametric statistics, and hence, a Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated between C and the distance to the active site. No family showed any statistically significant correlation. Also, when families with active sites of the same nature were analyzed together, no statistically significant results were obtained. This does not mean that there are no salt bridges that are maintained at a particular distance from the active site, such as the salt bridge between histidine 57 and aspartic acid 152 that is part of the active site in the serine protease family. However, the absence of correlation implies

Figure 4. The frequency distribution of C values in the non-single salt bridges is shown. The values range from 0.18 to 1.5, with one exception (C = 2.05 for the fully conserved salt bridge histidine 57­ aspartate 102, which, with serine 195, form the catalytic triad in the serine protease family).

that the salt bridges closest to the functional site are not necessarily the most conserved, and the majority of conserved salt bridges are maintained for other reasons that are not reflected by their distance from the active site. The nature and type of segments involved did not differ much between single and non-single salt bridges. Most salt bridges are believed to stabilize tertiary rather than secondary structure (Barlow & Thornton, 1983). This is really observed in the individual families as well as in the pooled data set, Table 3

as shown for the latter in Table 4. Out of a total of 161 salt bridges, 124 (77%) are found to be intersegmental. However, this characteristic could not distinguish between conserved and non-conserved salt bridges, and no difference could be found between those with high and low conservation (above and below the median of C). As for the salt bridges within segments (intrasegmental salt bridges), those were found to involve positions that would stabilize the secondary structure. All salt bridges within an a-helix were found in positions n, n + 3 and n, n + 4, while all

salt bridges within a b-strand were found in positions n, n + 2. Also, in most loops the salt bridges involved positions n, n + 2 and n, n + 3 (corresponding to b-turns). This holds for single and non-single salt bridges. The types of secondary structure segments that are connected by salt bridges are distributed similarly in single and non-single salt bridges (Table 5). Salt bridges which connect two a-helices (hh) show a slight tendency to be conserved, and those connecting a b-strand to a loop (sL) or to an a-helix (sh) are under-represented among non-single salt bridges. These frequencies are mostly contributed by specific families that have specific contents of secondary structures. Major fractions of the helix-helix and strand-loop interactions are contributed by the globin and serine protease families, respectively. The characteristics of the most conserved salt bridges in each family are summarized in Table 6. As can be seen, seven of the eight families show distinct features. In four protein families the most conserved salt bridges involve terminal segment(s) or the terminus per se. In two proteins, these salt bridges are highly buried. In the serine protease family, where the most conserved interaction involves the catalytic site, the second most conserved salt bridge involves the N terminus and is highly buried. In addition to analyses that concern the degree of conservation, different modes of conservations could also be examined and characterized. Three modes of conservation were defined: preservation, compensation and complementation (summarized in Table 7). Note that the total number of salt bridges does not add up to the total of 65 non-single salt Table 5

bridges, because more than one mode of conservation may be found for a non-single salt bridge. From Table 8A it is evident that a large fraction of the salt bridges that are conserved by preservation tend to be less exposed. On the contrary, most salt bridges with compensations are highly exposed. The salt bridges with complementation are distributed equally around the median of accessibility. To avoid any possible bias due to the occurrence of several modes of conservation for the same salt bridge and even between the same two sequences, we repeated the analysis excluding salt bridges with more than one conservation mode (Table 8B). Clearly, the preservations and compensations were not affected, but a difference in the distributions of complementations is seen. Many complementations are found between segments that already contain preservations. Indeed, when these are excluded, the majority of complementations are exposed, suggesting that many of the less exposed complementations are secondary to the preservations. Also, when including adjacent residues in the definitions of preservations and compensations, the number of complementations drops significantly (not shown), substantiating the above conclusion of their lesser use. Thus, although we found that most salt bridges are intersegmental, it seems that when an intersegmental salt bridge is conserved, the positions of the residues that participate in it are important.

Discussion
The current analysis is based on the general notion that conserved elements of proteins in a family are important for their structure and function. These

elements may be conserved residues, conserved segments, or conserved interactions. By the same reasoning, conserved salt bridges would not have been maintained if they did not have some importance. Common properties that are typical to conserved salt bridges and are not found in non-conserved salt bridges may shed light on general structural roles for these interactions. By this logic, we examined different qualitative and quantitative properties of salt bridges in an attempt to determine their relationship with conservation. One attribute of salt bridges that was found to be related to conservation was their surface accessibility. When comparing between salt bridges that appear in one protein only and salt bridges that appear in several members of a family we observed a clear trend of the single salt bridges to be more exposed. Based on the rationale that lack of conservation implies an unessential property, the large number of exposed salt bridges that are single casts doubt on their importance. This conclusion is consistent with substitution experiments that showed an insignificant influence of exposed salt bridges on protein stability (Horovitz et al., 1990; Dao-pin et al., 1991; Sali et al., 1991). Horovitz et al. (1990) showed that replacing an exposed salt bridge with alanine residues did not result in a significant effect on stability. Also it was evident from the structure and stability of several mutant proteins in which the mutated residues were exposed and could form new

salt bridges, that the putative partners remained flexible and did not show any indication of electrostatic attraction (Dao-pin et al., 1991; Sali et al., 1991). This may be explained by the higher dielectric constant at the protein surface compared to the core (Warshel & Russel, 1984), resulting in a smaller enthalpy. In addition, it suggests that the energy gained by forming a salt bridge does not usually compensate for the loss of entropy implied by the localization of the solvent exposed charged groups. An energy gain may be achieved when the charges are already localized, either by being buried or by an additional further charge (Anderson et al., 1990; Horovitz et al., 1990). Indeed, we find that the less exposed salt bridges are more conserved, and there is even a statistically significant correlation between the extent of conservation and the accessibility, the more conserved a salt bridge the more buried it is. This result suggests a relatively important role to less exposed salt bridges over exposed ones. The importance of less exposed salt bridges is also apparent from the analysis of the conservation mode. We distinguished between three modes of conserva-

133 analysis may indicate their spatial proximity. However, from our analysis, at least for salt bridges, it seems that most of the important interactions would not be maintained by such a mechanism. No statistically significant difference was found between single and non-single salt bridges regarding the nature of interactions and types of segments involved, and therefore general conclusion based on this part of the analysis could not be drawn. It was demonstrated before that 66% of salt bridges connect between two different segments (Barlow & Thornton, 1983). Table 4 shows an even higher proportion of intersegmental salt bridges (0.77). Yet, since the fractions of intersegmental salt bridges do not significantly differ between single and non-single salt bridges, this parameter cannot explain why some salt bridges are conserved and others are not. Also, when comparing between single and non-single salt bridges no significant trends regarding the types of segments involved could be observed. However, when examining the characteristics of the most conserved salt bridges in each family, we found in five out of eight families that these involve the terminus of the sequence or a terminal segment, suggesting that a general role of important salt bridges is to fix the terminal region within the tertiary structure of the protein. It may also contribute to the final determination of the required structure through the folding process. In an attempt to characterize the general structural role of salt bridges, the current study focused on identification of structural parameters which show a relationship to salt bridge conservation. While some such correlations were identified, they were not strong enough to provide a general convincing explanation for conservation. Unlike hydrophobic interactions, in which the high degree of conservation is attributed to their explicit structural role in stabilizing the core of globular proteins, a general role for salt bridges could not be inferred. Some of the highly conserved salt bridges were buried, one participated in the active site, and some involved distinct regions of the protein. This, together with the fact that many of the salt bridges are not conserved at all, suggests that the role of salt bridges is more specific, and their importance is either in establishing a certain structure, which would not have been maintained without them through the folding process, or in determining a functional site.

tion: preservation, compensation and complementation. Preservation is the most stringent mode of conservation, as it maintains exactly the same charges in equivalent residues and is expected to be found in important interactions. As can be seen in Table 8, a large fraction of the preservation is composed of less exposed salt bridges, which before were found to be more conserved. Furthermore, in the analysis of the most conserved salt bridge in a family (Table 6), all were found to be preserved. Conservation by complementation represents salt bridges which are important for connecting two segments, but not necessarily exactly at the same positions. Comparison between parts A and B of Table 8 shows that many of the less exposed complementations are secondary to preservations. Compensation is more difficult to comprehend. On one hand, correlated changes in two positions seem to point to a critical interaction. On the other hand, if this interaction is very important, it is hard to describe the series of events that led to its evolution. As the probability for two correlated mutations to take place in one generation is very low, the more reasonable pathway for their occurrence should span different generations. However, a reversal of one charge at a time could be disadvantageous for a critical salt bridge, and probably would not have been maintained until the compensatory change occurred (unless it had a temporary, less ideal partner in its near vicinity). This contradiction raises a possibility that the interactions that show charge compensations are not very important. Table 7 shows that there are only a few compensations and most of them occur in the globin family. Moreover, from Table 8 it is clear that most compensations are exposed to the solvent, indicating a lesser importance and also furnishing a reasonable explanation for their evolution, by a temporary interaction with the solvent. However, one example that is not included in our data set and demonstrates a compensation that maintains a very important interaction can be seen when comparing actin and the heat shock cognate protein hsc70 (Flaherty et al., 1991). The adenine binding pocket in actin is formed by glutamic acid 214, which is held in place by a salt bridge to an arginine located at position 210. In hsc70 the glutamic acid is replaced by an arginine and vice versa, maintaining the salt bridge and the structure of the binding pocket (Flaherty et al., 1991). Our analysis indicates that such examples are infrequent. In general, the role that direct compensatory amino acid changes play in structural conservation has been somewhat questionable. Superposition of members in four protein families (Lesk & Chothia, 1980, 1982; Chothia & Lesk, 1982, 1985), and visual inspection of the changes that occur in them regarding the residue volume, demonstrated that correlated changes in spatially close positions were detected only rarely. Examination of the sequence alignments of several other protein families demonstrated that such changes are observed (Altschuh et al., 1988; Goebel et al., 1994; Flaherty et al., 1991), suggesting that detection of coordinated changes by sequence

Methods
Source of proteins, protein families and structural alignment Protein families and the structural alignment of the family members were based on the database of Pascarella & Argos (1992). Only sequences of structurally solved proteins were used. Sequences which were not fully aligned or which introduced large gaps into the alignment were excluded, and only families consisting of at least four proteins were considered. The alignment of the acid protease family was based on that described by Pascarella & Argos (1992) but differed in one respect: instead of

JMB--MS 414 134
aligning the two halves of the protein sequence one with the other, we used the whole sequence for the alignment. Coordinate files for protein structures were taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB, Bernstein et al., 1977). The protein families and PDB files for family members are listed in Table 1. Definitions

C is not defined for single salt bridges; they are considered as not conserved and are not included in analyses that involve C.

Salt bridge
Composed of two atoms of opposite charges lying ° within a distance of 4 A (Barlow & Thornton, 1983). Possible charges include C and N termini oxygen and nitrogen, respectively, in addition to the charged amino acid residues histidine, arginine, lysine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid.

The accessible surface area of a salt bridge
The accessible surface area of a salt bridge (acc) was obtained by summing up the accessible surface areas of the two side-chains, and dividing it by the sum of the accessible surface areas of their extended conformations (Miller et al., 1987). acc was expressed in %. For a non-single salt bridge it is the mean of the acc values of this salt bridge in the different family members. The accessible surface area was calculated based on the method described by Lee & Richards (1971).

Equivalent residues
Residues of different proteins lying at the same position in the structural alignment.

Distance of a salt bridge from the active site
For proteins with a defined site of functional importance (catalysis, ligand or substrate binding), the distance of a salt bridge from this site was measured from the midpoint of the salt bridge to the centroid of the site. For a non-single salt bridge, the average of individual distances was used. Active sites used in this study were: globins, heme; serine proteases, Og of serine 195 of the catalytic triad; nucleotide binding domains, NADP; lysozymes, Od1,2 and Oe1,2 of aspartate 55 and glutamate 35, respectively, of the catalytic group; DHFR, the ligand folate or its inhibitor metathroxate; cytochrome c, heme; acid proteases, Od1,2 of aspartates 36 and 229 of the catalytic group; no active site was defined for immunoglobins.

Non-single salt bridge
An ensemble of salt bridges from different proteins of a family that either connect the same two secondary structure segments, or connect two residues within a particular secondary structure segment. They do not necessarily involve equivalent residues. An ensemble of such salt bridges is referred to in the analysis as one conserved salt bridge.

Single salt bridge
A salt bridge that appears in one family member only.

Types of secondary structures involved in the electrostatic interactions
Parameters used in the analysis Segments of secondary structure (hereinafter referred to as segments) were defined using the program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983), as a-helix (h), b-strand (s), or loop (L). Boundaries of segments were defined individually for every protein, considering also short strands (2 residues) and short helices (3 residues) when they occurred in more than one protein. In cases where a segment in one protein spanned two (or more) segments in another protein, these were grouped into one (interrupted) segment in accordance with the longer segment. A b-strand, and not a whole b-sheet, was considered as a distinct segment: b-strands were not grouped into b-sheets, because of the difficulties in defining equivalent elements of b-sheets in the different proteins of a family.

The degree of conservation of a salt bridge
The degree of conservation of a salt bridge (C) is evaluated by:

C=

Nt is the total number of proteins in a family and Ns the number of proteins which contain this particular salt bridge (a protein with more than one salt bridge connecting the same two secondary structure segments is counted only once). Ns /Nt is weighted by a factor ((Ssim/np) - 1 ) which accounts for the degree of sequence similarity among those proteins. A measure of similarity, sim, is calculated for every pair of proteins in a family that contain the particular salt bridge, and is the fraction of similar residues in structurally aligned positions. Similar residues were considered by their character as follows: hydrophobic, L, I, V, M; aromatic, F, Y, W; basic hydrophilic, H, K, R; acid hydrophilic, Q, N, E, D; small, relatively neutral, P, A, G, S, T; cysteine, C (amino acid residues in one letter

Terminal segments. These refer to the first and last secondary structure segments in a protein. Nature of interaction: intrasegmental versus intersegmental Intrasegmental. This is a salt bridge between residues within a segment. Intersegmental. This is a salt bridge connecting residues of two distinct segments.
