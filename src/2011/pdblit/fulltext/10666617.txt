Catalase (E.C. 1.11.1.6) was puri®ed from human erythrocytes and crystallized in three different forms: orthorhombic, hexagonal and tetragonal. The structure of the orthorhombic crystal form of human erythrocyte catalase (HEC), with space group P212121 and unit-cell Ê parameters a = 84.9, b = 141.7, c = 232.5 A, was determined and Ê re®ned with 2.75 A resolution data. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were employed and the resulting R value and Rfree were 0.206 and 0.272, respectively. The overall structure and arrangement of HEC molecules in the orthorhombic unit cell were very similar to those of bovine liver catalase (BLC). However, no NADPH was observed in the HEC crystal and a water was bound to the active-site residue His75. Conserved lattice interactions suggested a common growth mechanism for the orthorhombic crystals of HEC and BLC.

1. Introduction
The presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in all aerobic organisms is harmful to DNA and other cellular components and causes disease and ageing if not immediately scavenged (Halliwell & Gutteridge, 1990). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the ROS that decomposes into free hydroxyl radicals, the most deleterious species of activated oxygen (Scandalios, 1997). Catalase (E.C. 1.11.1.6) catalyzes the reaction 2H2 O2 3 2H2 O  O2 and is directly involved in eliminating oxidative stress. Loss of the catalase gene decreased the viability of fruit ¯ies (Griswold et al., 1993) and reduced catalatic activity in Xeroderma pigmentosum cells could be directly related to impaired DNA repair (Quilliet et al., 1997), while stable overexpression of the catalase gene markedly attenuated the H2O2-induced toxic effect in immortalized neural cells (Mann et al., 1997). Catalase was shown to be effective in inhibiting the degeneration of neurons (Busciglio & Yankner, 1995). A growthpromoting factor derived from human erythrocytes with a wide target-cell spectrum was also identi®ed as catalase (Takeuchi et al., 1995). Human erythrocyte catalase (HEC) is a tetrameric protein of 244 kDa, comprising four identical subunits of 59.7 kDa plus four heme groups and four NADPH molecules (Bonaventura et al., 1972; Kirkman & Gaetani, 1984). It is very similar to bovine liver catalase (BLC), which is the only known mammalian catalase that has had its three-dimensional structure

determined (Murthy et al., 1981). The human gene of catalase has been cloned (Quan et al., 1986). Besides the 25-residue extension at the C-terminus, HEC differs from BLC in 43 amino-acid residues. In BLC, the four subunits are related by a 222 point-group molecular symmetry. Catalases from other sources, e.g. the Proteus mirabilis catalase (PMC; Gouet et al., 1995), catalase-A from Saccharomyces Â, cerevisiae (SCC-A; Mate Zamocky et al., 1999) and a larger catalase from Escherichia coli (HPII; Bravo et al., 1995), have a similar core structure and the same tetrameric organization as BLC. The tetrameric enzyme contains a central cavity and several channels that reach the active-site heme groups and facilitate the entry and exit of substrates and products (Fita & Rossmann, 1985; Gouet et al., 1996; Sevinc et al., 1999). Because of their large molecular size, catalases have been exploited in a number of crystal-growth experiments (Sato et al., 1993; Malkin et al., 1995). HEC was observed as twodimensional crystals by electron microscopy (Harris et al., 1993; Harris & Holzenburg, 1995), but three-dimensional crystals have not Â, been reported until recently (Mate Lombardia et al., 1999). In this paper, we describe the puri®cation of HEC and its crystallization in new crystal forms. We have also determined the structure of HEC in an orthorhombic crystal by molecular replacement. This turned out to be very similar to the orthorhombic BLC crystals recently reported by Ko et al. (1999). Packing and intermolecular interactions explained the growth mechanism of the BLC crystals, which may also apply to the HEC crystals.

Data were processed using the BIOTEX software (Molecular Structure Corporation, The Woodlands, Texas, USA) and the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Statistics are listed in Table 1. The second crystal form, having approximately hexagonal bipyramidal morphology, grew in drops equilibrated against a reservoir containing 5.5% PEG 8000, 15 mM MgSO4, 70 mM Tris buffer at the high pH value of 8.5. The crystals were of red±brown color and reached maximum dimensions of 0.4 Â 0.3 Â 0.2 mm. This crystal form belongs to a hexagonal space group but diffracted poorly; no attempt was made to determine the space group. The unit-cell Ê parameters are a = b = 88.3, c = 257.1 A, similar to the unit-cell dimensions reported Â, by Mate Lombardia et al. (1999) in their characterization of the HEC crystal. Their crystal belonged to the hexagonal space group P6422; it is most likely that our crystal also belongs to this space group. A further search for crystallization conditions yielded a third crystal form. The reservoir contained 0.7 M potassium sodium tartrate and 0.1 M HEPES buffer pH 7.0. Protein concentration before mixing was 16 mg mlÀ1 and the initial drop volume was 3 ml. These crystals grew slowly over 4±6 months at room temperature and had well de®ned morphology. The ®nal crystals had dimensions of 0.32 Â 0.25 Â 0.25 mm and Ê diffracted X-rays to about 2.9 A resolution. The crystals belonged to the space group I41, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 202.9, Ê c = 152.4 A.
2.2. Structure determination and refinement

The structure determination was carried out using the orthorhombic crystal of HEC and the BLC model (PDB entry 4blc; Ko et al., 1999). Because the space group and unitcell dimensions of the BLC and HEC crystals were almost identical, the molecular packing and overall protein fold were presumed to be identical. Therefore, no rotational or translational search with the model was necessary. Direct application of the BLC model to the HEC crystal yielded a correlation coef®cient of 0.74 and an R value of 0.30, calculated by the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) using data in the resolution Ê range 8.0±4.0 A. Subsequent re®nement of the model employed the program X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992a). Model building was carried out on an SGI Octane using the

The stereochemistry of the model was evaluated by PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993). The programs TOM (Jones, 1982), MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991), Raster3D (Merritt & Murphy, 1994) and GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991) were used to produce the ®gures.

randomly selected 8% of re¯ections in the data set were excluded for cross-validation È using Rfree (Brunger, 1992b). The procedure È of simulated annealing (Brunger et al., 1987, 1990) at high temperature was used; bulkÈ solvent correction (Jiang & Brunger, 1994) was also employed to incorporate the lowresolution data. Map calculations and density modi®cations included the entire data set. The NADPH molecules in BLC were not observed in the initial Fourier maps of the HEC crystal and were deleted. The HEC sequence was obtained from the SWISS±PROT database (accession number P04040). After substituting the 43 different amino-acid residues in BLC with those of HEC, preliminary re®nement of the model gave an R value and an Rfree of 0.30 and 0.37, respectively. This provided starting phase angles for subsequent density modi®cation (DM) with solvent ¯attening, histogram matching and fourfold molecular averaging using the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). In DM, Rfree improved from 0.362 to 0.304 and correlation coef®cients between the subunit densities improved from 0.783±0.795 to 0.919±0.925. The map calculated using DM phases showed well de®ned density for the entire tetramer and additional densities for water molecules. Fig. 1 shows a DM map around one of the heme groups. However, in the N- and C-terminal regions the densities were still insuf®cient to allow tracing of the missing residues 1±3 and 503±527. The re®nement proceeded with non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints. No improvement in the terminal regions was seen in the maps recalculated after re®nement.

The ®nal model contained 1997 aminoacid residues in four subunits (named A, B, C and D), four heme groups and 393 waters. The polypeptide chain of each subunit had residues 4±502. An additional residue, Glu503, was included as an alanine in subunit B because its backbone was visible in the electron-density maps. With strong NCS and stereochemical restraints applied, the R value and Rfree were 0.239 and 0.316, respectively, for all data in the resolution Ê range 40±2.75 A. For data with a 2' F cutoff, the corresponding values became 0.206 and 0.272, respectively. The average coordinate Ê errors were between 0.30 and 0.35 A, as estimated by a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952). Other statistical values are listed in Table 1. The Ramachandran plot from PROCHECK showed that 80.3% of non-glycine and nonproline residues were in the most favored regions and only one residue, Ser217, in all four subunits was in a disallowed region. It had 9 and 2 angles of 73 Æ 5 and À59 Æ 4 , respectively. Similar conformations were observed in the corresponding residues of other catalase models, e.g. Ser216 in BLC and Ile274 in HPII. The average temperaÊ ture factor of 12.8 A2 was lower than the Ê value of about 20 A2 estimated by a Wilson plot (Wilson, 1950). This was probably a consequence of the low resolution of the data set. The overall protein fold of HEC is identical to BLC, with a core structure of an eight-stranded -barrel surrounded by a number of -helices (Fita & Rossmann, 1985). The four subunits were organized about three perpendicularly intersecting dyad axes and express 222 point-group symmetry. The r.m.s.d. coordinate differences between the four subunits were Ê Ê 0.156 A for the backbone atoms, 0.400 A for Ê for the heme the side chains and 0.125 A groups, re¯ecting appropriate maintenance of the NCS restraints. The entire HEC and BLC tetramers could also be superimposed Ê with an r.m.s.d. of 0.387 A for 1996 equivalent C atoms. The r.m.s.d. for the 7984 Ê backbone atoms was 0.423 A and was Ê for the 7740 equivalent atoms in the 1.006 A side chains. The four heme groups deviated Ê Ê by an r.m.s.d. of 0.724 A or 0.41±0.53 A when superimposed separately. Fig. 2 shows the two catalase models superposed. The 43 different amino-acid residues appear to be randomly distributed throughout the protein. Nevertheless, the 9 strand, which is involved in an association with its symmetryKo et al.

related equivalent, contains six amino-acid substitutions. The ligand to the heme iron, Tyr358 of HEC, as well as the essential His75 assumed virtually identical conformations to those observed in BLC. Other active-site residues, more than 30 in number, which constitute the binding pocket and proximal and distal sides of the heme group, are all conserved in HEC and BLC, except for the substitution of Ala157 in BLC by Pro158 in HEC. This residue is in contact with the vinyl group of the heme pyrrole ring I and has -helical conformation. It is the ®rst residue of the 3 helix and is well accommodated. Ê At 2.75 A resolution, not much information could be extracted from the HEC model, even though it was re®ned with strong stereochemical and fourfold NCS restraints. The major difference between the two almost isomorphous orthorhombic crystal structures of HEC and BLC was the absence of bound NADPH molecules in HEC. The 19 amino-acid residues of BLC involved in contact with NADPH are also conserved in HEC, with the exception of Asp212 in BLC versus Asn213 in HEC. The acidic side chain of Asp212 in BLC forms hydrogen bonds with the 3H -phosphate of the NADPH molecule. Substitution by Asn213 in HEC neutralizes the side chain yet still maintains hydrogen-bonding capacity. Comparison with the BLC structure showed that the guanidinium group of Arg203 in HEC was rotated 60 away from the NADPH-binding position to form hydrogen bonds with the phenolic O atom of Tyr215. The 76 backbone atoms of the 19 residues that line the NADPH pocket in HEC and BLC could be superimposed with r.m.s.d.s in Ê the range 0.30±0.46 A, depending on the subunits compared. The side chains deviated Ê by an r.m.s.d. of 0.72±0.86 A for 99 equivalent atoms. Because the differences are small, all of these residues in HEC can be readily adjusted to make proper interactions with the NADPH molecule as in BLC. Therefore, the binding site should be intact and functional. In addition, the side-chain amino group of Lys306 in HEC was close to the pyrophosphate group of NADPH in Ê BLC, with distances of 1.7±2.4 A. By forming salt bridge and/or hydrogen bonds with the pyrophosphate, this lysine should further strengthen the binding of NADPH to HEC. The corresponding residue in BLC is Gly305 and similar arrangement is not possible. In the orthorhombic BLC structure, the side chain of Phe197 had two conformations `A' and `B', which differ by a 11 rotation of 120 ; in the trigonal BLC crystal (PDB entry 7cat), it had the `B' conformation; in the current HEC model, all equivalent Phe198 had the `A' conformation. In either conformation, this side chain makes close contacts with the nicotinamide and adenine groups of the NADPH molecule; it is uncertain which conformation would be favored in binding NADPH. In the structure of SCC-A, the NADP(H) site had only a partial occupancy of about Â, 50% (Mate Zamocky et al., 1999). The NADPH molecules in the orthorhombic BLC crystals had extremely high temperature factors (Ko et al., 1999). The results suggested weak binding of the dinucleotide in these crystals. Kirkman & Gaetani (1984) showed that both HEC and BLC bind strongly to NADPH but not to NADP+, with af®nities NADPH > NADH >> NADP+ > NAD+. In the present study, the enzyme was puri®ed from blood after prolonged storage and no NADPH was added. Most of the coenzyme would have been oxidized and readily dissociated from the HEC molecules. Nevertheless, the speci®c catalytic activity of the puri®ed protein solution or redissolved HEC crystals was comparable with that of BLC (data not shown). This is consistent with the results of PMC, which can be fully active with NADPH removed (Gouet et al., 1995).

Figure 2

The orthorhombic HEC crystal had a speci®c volume (Matthews, 1968) of Ê Vm = 2.87 A3 DaÀ1, corresponding to a solvent content of 57%. There were 384 bound waters in the BLC crystal structure and 393 in the current HEC model. When the two models were superimposed, 38 pairs of equivalent waters were matched within Ê 1.5 A distance. If the matching criterion was Ê 1.0 A, the number of equivalents would be 19. These are few compared with the 99 equivalent waters in the trigonal and orthorhombic crystal structures of BLC (Fita et al., 1986; Ko et al., 1999). The 19 conserved waters showed a featureless pattern of distribution, except those bound to the O1A atoms of heme propionate and Thr361 OG1 atoms in all four subunits. In addition, a notable active-site water bound to the NE2 of His75 (at a distance of Ê 2.59±2.85 A) and possibly OD1 of Asn148 Ê (at a distance of 3.21±3.89 A) was also observed in each subunit. These `substrate' waters had low temperature factors and strong electron densities in the Fourier maps (Fig. 1). The equivalent solvent molecules have been observed in a number of other catalases, including an azide ion in SCC-A Â, (Mate Zamocky et al., 1999) and a water in HPII (Bravo et al., 1995), but not in either crystal form of BLC. On the proximal side of the heme group, solvent channels with 3±4 bound water molecules were visible, but they appeared not to be directly involved in interaction with the active site. The channels were connected to the central cavity of the HEC tetramer, in which there were 16 waters. Because the HEC crystal is almost identical or quasi-isomorphous to the BLC crystal, the interactions between the tetrameric catalase molecules should be very similar. This was veri®ed by analyzing the crystal contacts. Like BLC, an HEC molecule was in contact with four symmetryrelated neighbors in the crystal and the interactions could be divided into two types. The ®rst type (interface I) is between molecules related by the 21 screw axis

There were at least 14 water molecules involved, which contributed an Ê additional 380 A2 to the interface area. The second type (interface II) is between molecules related by the screw axis parallel to the a axis and, by coincidence, a non-crystallographic pseudo-dyad axis. The contact Ê Ê areas were 304 A2 and 287 A2 on the two Ê protein molecules and 141 A2 on six waters. Interface I covered twice as much surface area as did interface II. Speci®c interactions could not be identi®ed for sure owing to the low resolution and the NCS restraints of the re®nement. Nevertheless, a few possible contacts are listed in Table 2. The salt bridges of GluB290±LysC106*1 and GluB428±LysC315* in HEC correspond to GluB289±ArgC105* and AspB427± LysC314* in BLC. In addition to the polar residues, interface I contains a hydrophobic patch of PheB432, ProC46, ThrC88* and IleC103*. Identical non-polar interactions were also observed for BLC. Interface II contains no salt bridge but involves several backbone atoms. In this region, the C-terminus of the 10 helix of subunit A was directed to the N-terminus of the 11 helix of subunit D* and vice versa. Thus, the two antiparallel helices were symmetrically extended across the interface to the other molecule by dipole±dipole interactions and hydrogen bonding. Consequently, in the HEC crystal both regions of lattice contacts were largely conserved with respect to the BLC crystal, although NADPH was not observed in HEC and waters were not

involved in BLC. The non-conserved contacts were a consequence of nonconserved residues in these regions, which made a different set of hydrogen-bonding interactions between side chains. Presumably, HEC and BLC share the same crystalgrowth mechanism in the orthorhombic space group as described by Ko et al. (1999), i.e. by formation of half unit-cell layers. Within a layer, molecules are associated through the stronger interface I; between adjacent layers, they interact through the weaker interface II.
