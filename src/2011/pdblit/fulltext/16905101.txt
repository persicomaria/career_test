[43] Purification and Functional Properties of Rab11FIP2
By ANDREW J. LINDSAY and MARY W. MCCAFFREY
Abstract

Rab11FIP2 is a 512-amino acid protein that was first identified in a screen for Rab11 interacting proteins. Database analysis revealed that it belongs to a family of proteins characterized by the presence of a highly homologous domain located at its carboxytermini. This family was termed the Rab11 family of interacting proteins (Rab11FIPs), as all members have been demonstrated to interact with Rab11. The Rab11FIPs can be further subdivided into two classes. Rab11FIP2 belongs to the class I Rab11FIPs due to the presence of a C2 domain near its aminoterminus. RCP and Rip11 are the other class I family members. A number of proteins that interact directly with Rab11FIP2, in addition to Rab11, have been identified. These include the EH domaincontaining protein Reps1, the AP2 subunit adaptin, the actinbased motor protein myosin Vb, and the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. It is hypothesized that Rab11FIP2 functions to transport cargo, such as chemokine receptors and the EGF receptor, from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to the plasma membrane.

GTPases regulating membrane targeting and fusion

[43]

Introduction

Rab11 belongs to the Rab family of small GTPases, of which there are approximately 60 members in the human genome (Bock et al., 2001). Rab11 is found primarily at the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) but has also been localized to the transGolgi network (TGN) (Urbe et al., 1993). It functions to regulate the transport of cargo from the ERC to the plasma membrane and between the ERC and the TGN (Ullrich et al., 1996). The Rab11 subfamily is composed of three members--Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25. Rab11a and Rab11b seem to be ubiquitously expressed, whereas Rab25 expression is restricted to epithelial tissue (Goldenring et al., 1993). The primary sequence of Rab25 is the most divergent of the Rab11 subfamily (Fig. 1A). One of the methods researchers have used to further understand the function of Rab11 and to dissect the specific roles of each isoform is to identify effector proteins through which it mediates its function. To this end, a number of laboratories identified Rab11FIP2 by virtue of its homology to other members of the Rab11FIP family (Hales et al., 2001; Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2002; Prekeris et al., 2001). Rab11FIP2 was initially isolated as part of a project to clone large cDNA open reading frames and was designated KIAA0941 (Nagase et al., 1999). Primary sequence analysis revealed the presence of an approximately 20amino acid Rabbinding domain (RBD) at its carboxyterminus that mediates the interaction with Rab11. Rab11FIP2 has a C2 domain near its aminoterminus that is highly homologous to the C2 domains of RCP and Rip11 and binds the phospholipids, phosphatidic acid, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2004). The central region of the class I Rab11FIPs that links the C2 domain and the RBD is highly divergent and therefore likely to mediate the specific functions of these related proteins. This could either be by targeting the protein for posttranslational modification, or via interaction with other protein(s). For example, Rab Coupling Protein (RCP) possesses three PEST domains that target it for calpainspecific proteolysis (Marie et al., 2005). Neither Rip11 nor Rab11FIP2 contains PEST motifs. In contrast, Rab11FIP2 has three asparagine, proline, phenylalanine (NPF) repeats in the ``linker'' region (Fig. 1B). NPF repeats are binding motifs for EH domaincontaining proteins. Indeed, the EH domain protein Reps1 was found to be a binding partner of Rab11FIP2 (Cullis et al., 2002). Rab11FIP2 has also been demonstrated to interact with the actin based motor protein myosin Vb and is likely to be involved in regulating the movement of transport vesicles along actin filaments (Hales et al., 2002). One set of cargo molecules that is recycled in a Rab11FIP2dependent manner is the chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. In fact,

and the development of a fluorescentbased trafficking assay to study the effects of overexpression of Rab11FIP2 truncation mutants on transferrin recycling.
Materials
Dthiogalactopyranoside

Reagents for bacterial growth were purchased from Difco. Isopropyl (IPTG) and dithiothreitol (DTT) are from Melford. Alexa594transferrin is from Molecular Probes. Ironsaturated holotransferrin and desferrioxamine are from Sigma. Effectene transfection reagent and NiNTA Agarose are from Qiagen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Lglutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin EDTA, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Cambrex. The 6Â Histagged fusion vector pTrcHisC was purchased from Invitrogen and pEGFPC1 was from Clontech. A plasmid containing the complete open reading frame of Rab11FIP2 (KIAA0941) was kindly supplied by the Kazusa Human cDNA Project (Kazusa, Japan) (Nagase et al., 1999). This was used as the template in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that amplified the open reading frame, minus the first methionine, and attached EcoRI sites at the 50 and 30 ends. The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI sites of pTrcHisC and pEGFPC1. The PCR products were sequenced to ensure that no random mutations had been incorporated. The dominantnegative Rab11FIP2 carboxyterminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct was generated by inserting the approximately 200bp PstI fragment encoding amino acids 446­512 into the PstI site of pEGFPC1.

Methods

Batch Purification of 6ÂHisRab11 FIP2 Rab11FIP2 is a 512amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 58 kDa. The 6Â histidine tag was placed at the aminoterminus to avoid any interference with the RBD. BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with pTrcHisC Rab11FIP2 are grown at 37 in 1 liter of Luria broth (LB) containing 50 g/ml ampicillin to an OD600 of approximately 0.4. Expression of the recombinant protein is induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and the culture is incubated for a further 4 h, this time at 30 to reduce the potential of highlevel expression resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies. The cells are harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole),

snapfrozen, and stored at À80 . To prepare a crude lysate, the suspension is rapidly thawed at 37 and sonicated at a medium setting for three 30­s intervals (MSE Soniprep 150). All further steps should be performed at 4 . Triton X100 is added to a final concentration of 0.1% and the lysate is rotated at 4 for 30 min. The lysate is clarified by centrifugation at 14,000Âg for 20 min. Meanwhile, 1 ml of 50% NiNTA agarose is preequilibrated in Buffer A plus 0.1% Triton X100 for 30 min on ice. The clarified lysate is added to the agarose and the mixture is rotated for 2 h. The agarose is subsequently pelleted by spinning at 1000 Â g and washed three times with 5 ml of Buffer B (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 40 mM imidazole). The HisRab11FIP2 recombinant protein is eluted by incubating the agarose beads in 500 l of Buffer C (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole) for 5 min at room temperature. This elution step is repeated twice more and the samples are pooled and dialyzed overnight against phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). Purified HisRab11FIP2 is aliquoted and stored at À80 . Note: Samples should be taken at each step of the purification and checked by sodium dodecyl sulfate­polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS­PAGE) (Fig. 1C). Prepared under the conditions described above Rab11FIP2 is largely soluble and the majority of the recombinant protein will partition in the clarified lysate. FluorescentBased Recycling Assay To determine if Rab11FIP2 functions to regulate the movement of cargo along the endocyticrecycling pathway, a transport assay was developed. The effect of the overexpression of wildtype Rab11FIP2, or a truncation mutant containing the RBD, on the trafficking of transferrin was assessed. The constitutive recycling pathway of transferrin is well defined and has thus proved to be a useful tool in characterizing proteins involved in endocytosis. To determine the effect of overexpression of wildtype and truncation mutants of Rab11FIP2 on the trafficking of transferrin, HeLa or A431 cells are seeded onto 10mm coverslips in 24well plates, at a density such that they will be 60­70% confluent the next day. The cells are cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and penicillin/ streptomycin. The plasmids pEGFPC1 Rab11FIP2 and pEGFPC1 Rab11FIP2(446­512) are purified from Escherichia coli XL1 bacteria using the Wizard PureFection Plasmid DNA Purification System from Promega. The day after seeding 0.4 g of each plasmid is transfected into separate wells using the Effectene transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 8 h posttransfection the medium

containing the liposome:DNA complexes is removed, cells are washed once with PBS, and fresh medium is added. Expression of the GFPfusion proteins is allowed to proceed a further 16 h, for a total of 24 h. The cells are then washed with PBS and depletion media (DMEM, plus 2 mM glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, minus serum) is added for 1 h. Once the ``starvation'' period is complete, uptake medium (depletion medium supplemented with 25 g/ml Alexa594transferrin) is added and the cells are allowed to internalize the transferrin for 45 min at 37 . To assess the effect that the expression of the exogenous proteins has on the internalization of transferrin, the cells are washed with icecold PBS and fixed immediately with 3% paraformaldehyde. Alternatively, to determine whether the overexpression of these constructs has an effect on the recycling of transferrin back out of the cell, the cells are washed to remove excess transferrin and chase medium (depletion medium, 250 g/ml unlabeled ironsaturated holotransferrin, and 50 M desferrioxamine) is added and the cells are incubated for a further 60 min at 37 . Each well is then washed with icecold PBS and fixed immediately. In control cells fixed directly after the 45 min uptake, either nontransfected cells or cells expressing GFP on its own, the Alexa594transferrin will label the entire recycling pathway including the sorting endosomes, ERC, and intermediate transport vesicles. In cells fixed after the chase, the majority of the transferrin will have recycled out, yielding a dramatically reduced fluorescence signal. If expression of the GFPfusion protein has an effect on internalization of cargo, the pattern of Alexa594Tfn in the uptake samples should be different from nontransfected cells in the same field and from the pattern of cells expressing GFP alone. Similarly, if the recombinant protein functions along the recycling step, expression of truncation mutants should alter the transferrin distribution in the chase sample. Fulllength Rab11FIP2 or the carboxyterminal truncation mutant has no effect on transferrin internalization; however, the overexpression of GFP Rab11FIP2(446­512) inhibits the rate of recycling of transferrin. In cells transfected with this mutant, the Alexa594Tfn is trapped in an intricate tubulovesicular structure after the chase, whereas nontransfected cells in the same field have recycled the fluorescent transferrin back into the medium (Fig. 2). Expression of fulllength Rab11FIP2 does not inhibit the rate of transferrin recycling. Note: The desferrioxamine is added to the chase medium to chelate free iron in the medium, thus preventing the recycled transferrin from binding iron, which could then be reinternalized. This assay can be adapted for use with any construct suspected of involvement in the receptor recycling pathway.

FIG. 2. Effect of Rab11FIP2 expression on transferrin trafficking. HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFPRab11FIP2 or pEGFPRab11FIP2(446­512). Twentyfour hours posttransfection the cells were serum starved and then allowed to internalize 25 g/ml Alexa594Tfn for 45 min at 37 . After the internalization step, the cells were either fixed immediately or the fluorescent transferrin was chased with excess unlabeled transferrin for 60 min and then fixed. Expression of Rab11FIP2 or its truncation mutant had no effect on the internalization of transferrin; however, Rab11FIP2(446­512) inhibited the rate of transferrin recycling. Transfected cells are indicated by an asterisk.

Quantification of Transferrin Internalization and Recycling The effect of the expression of GFPRab11FIP2, and mutants, on the internalization and recycling of transferrin can be quantified by measuring the intensity of Alexa594Tfn fluorescence in cells fixed after internalization of the ligand or fixed after the chase. Measuring the fluorescence intensity in a large number of cells from multiple experiments can yield statistically significant results. We acquired images of multiple fields, under each condition, from several experiments, using a Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescence microscope fitted with a Hamamatsu Chilled CCD (C5985) camera. Two images from each field were captured, one using a green filter (Nikon BA515­555) to identify transfected cells and one image captured with a red filter (Nikon BA600­660) to visualize the transferrin within the cell. All fields were acquired under the same magnification, exposure, and gain settings. Care was taken to ensure that the fluorescence signal was not saturated. The recorded conditions included wildtype and truncated Rab11FIP2 mutant expressing cells fixed immediately after the uptake, or fixed after the chase. To measure the intensity of the AlexaTfn in these transfected cells, we

498

[43]

used the NIH Image Version 1.63 software run on an Apple Mac Power PC. The images are imported into the software and a uniform box size is overlaid onto each transfected cell. The average fluorescence intensity of the AlexaTfn within the box is measured. A threshold background fluorescence is calculated from cells that have not been allowed to internalize transferrin. This threshold value accounts for the intrinsic autofluorescence of the cell and is subtracted from each experimental value. In this way, a large number of cells can be efficiently measured. We observed that Rab11FIP2 or Rab11FIP2(446­512) had no effect on the internalization of transferrin; however, there was over a 2fold increase in the amount of AlexaTfn retained in cells expressing Rab11FIP2(446­512) after the chase (Lindsay and McCaffrey, 2002). This indicates that Rab11FIP2 plays a role in the recycling of transferrin back to the plasma membrane. Note: This fluorescencebased transport assay can be modified to measure an effect on the time course of ligand internalization or recycling. For the former, AlexaTfn is incubated with the cells at 4 . This allows the transferrin to bind to its receptors on the cell surface but prevents the endocytosis of the receptor­ligand complex. The excess ligand is then washed off and the medium is warmed to 37 to initiate internalization. The cells can then be fixed at various times after warming. The majority of transferrin will enter the sorting endosomes after 5 min and have reached the ERC by 20 min. To analyze the kinetics of recycling, the cells are allowed to internalize AlexaTfn at 16 . At this temperature the ligand can enter the sorting endosome, but onward transport from this compartment is blocked. To allow recycling to initiate, after washing away excess ligand, the medium is warmed to 37 , and the cells can be fixed at various times after.

Abstract

The Rab family of small GTPases are key regulators of membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Rab11, one member of this family, plays a role in regulating various cellular functions such as plasma membrane recycling, phagocytosis, and cytokinesis. A family of Rab11binding proteins has been identified and termed the Rab11 family interacting proteins or Rab11FIPs. Rab11FIP3, a member of this Rab11binding protein family, in addition to interacting with Rab11, is also capable of interaction with members of the ADPRibosylation Factor (ARF) GTPase family.
