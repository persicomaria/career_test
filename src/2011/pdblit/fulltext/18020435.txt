Inhibitors of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone are showing considerable promise as potential chemotherapeutic agents for cancer. Here, we describe the structure-based design, synthesis, structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetics of potent small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 based on the 4,5-diarylisoxazole scaffold. Analogues from this series have high affinity for Hsp90, as measured in a fluorescence polarization (FP) competitive binding assay, and are active in cancer cell lines where they inhibit proliferation and exhibit a characteristic profile of depletion of oncogenic proteins and concomitant elevation of Hsp72. Compound 40f (VER-52296/NVP-AUY922) is potent in the Hsp90 FP binding assay (IC50 ) 21 nM) and inhibits proliferation of various human cancer cell lines in vitro, with GI50 averaging 9 nM. Compound 40f is retained in tumors in vivo when administered i.p., as evaluated by cassette dosing in tumor-bearing mice. In a human colon cancer xenograft model, 40f inhibits tumor growth by 50%.
Introduction Molecular chaperones are proteins which play a key role in the conformational maturation, stability and function of other "client"protein substrates within the cell.1,2 Many of the client proteins of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)3­6 are involved in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, including kinases, transcription factors and hormone receptors. The dysregulation of pathways involving these proteins are commonly associated with cancer pathology,7 and Hsp90 thus plays a key role in assisting survival, proliferation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, which represent the hallmark traits of malignancy. However, Hsp90 is ubiquitously expressed in normal cells, comprising 1­2% of the total cellular protein, and has important functions in normal cell homeostasis. Consequently, Hsp90 was not pursued as a drug target until the discovery and characterization of natural product inhibitors of Hsp90 function such as geldanamycin8­10 (GM) and radicicol11,12 (RD) (Figure 1, 1a and 2). In the cell, Hsp90 function is complex, involving homodimerization and binding to client proteins, co-chaperones and other accessory proteins operating in a chaperone cycle.13 The chaperone cycle is driven by hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and by ATP/ADP exchange,14,15 and it was shown that both GM and RD are able to inhibit Hsp90 function by binding to an ATP binding pocket in the N-terminal domain of Hsp90.16 The subsequent loss of chaperone function causes client proteins to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The prevalence of a high-affinity form of Hsp90 in tumor cells, the "addiction"of cancer cells to oncogenic client proteins and their greater dependency on Hsp90 have been proposed as rationales for selectivity of Hsp90 inhibitors for

cancer versus normal cells.17 Further validation of Hsp90 as a protein target for drug discovery comes from pharmacological and clinical studies with the GM analogue 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG, Figure 1, 1b).18 This first-in-class Hsp90 inhibitor to enter clinical trials has generated encouraging results in Phase-I trials.19­21 Further clinical trials have been initiated with 17-AAG used as a single agent and in drug combinations in various cancer types. Hsp90 inhibitors are now the focus of significant research and development efforts,22­25 and their ability to interfere with multiple oncogenic pathways has raised hopes that they will show broad antitumor activity and be less susceptible to acquired drug resistance. However, despite the high cellular activity and clinical progression of 17-AAG, this compound has several potential limitations, including poor solubility, (thereby demanding special formulation), limited bioavailability, hepatotoxicity and extensive metabolism by polymorphic enzymes.26­28 Some of these issues have been addressed with the development of the water-soluble ansamycin 17-dimethylaminoethylgeldanamycin (17-DMAG Figure 1, 1c)29 and the prodrug of 17-AAG, IPI-50430,31 (Figure 1), which are reported to be in Phase-I/Ib and Phase-I/II clinical trials, respectively. However, these issues and the inherent chemical complexity of these ansamycin inhibitors have led to significant efforts to identify novel small-molecule inhibitors of Hsp90.22,32­37 Research from several groups has focused on the purine scaffold and has generated potent inhibitors such as 3 and 4 (Figure 2), which are active in cellular and animal models of cancer.38­40 We recently disclosed the identification of 4,5diarylpyrazoles such as 5 (Figure 3) as a new class of Hsp90 inhibitors,41,42 and the structure-based elaboration of this hit resulted in the amide-substituted pyrazole 6.43 Compound 6 binds to the ATP binding site of Hsp90 with an IC50 of 25 nM in a FP assay and has antiproliferative activity against HCT116 colon cancer cells, with a GI50 of 260 nM. This activity compares favorably with the GI50 value for 17-AAG of 160

and assessing the ability to inhibit tumor growth in the HCT116 human colon carcinoma murine xenograft model. Chemistry Our strategy to optimize the in vivo activity in our series was focused on the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in three distinct areas of the molecule and was guided by structural information of ligands (such as 6) bound to the ATP binding site of Hsp90R.46 The binding mode anchor of this family of compounds is the resorcinol moiety, also present in radicicol.16 The resorcinol binds deep into the pocket, where the 4-hydroxyl displaces one of the four water molecules that mediate substrate binding in the adenine binding region. Both phenolic hydroxyl groups and the N atoms of the pyrazole ring form a very tight network of hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate of the key residue Asp93 and surrounding polar groups or water molecules. The high complementarities and tight packing between Hsp90 and the inhibitor in this area leave room only for small modifications of

nM in the same tumor cell line. Further medicinal chemistry efforts in this area have identified 4-substituted pyrazole amides such as 744 and piperazines 8.45 These are not as active in the FP assay as compound 6 and, consequently, exhibit reduced activity in tumor cell lines. Here, we report on further medicinal chemistry studies which identified diarylisoxazoles with a greater than 20-fold increase in their ability to inhibit cancer cell proliferation compared with that of previously reported diarylpyrazole compounds. Pharmacokinetic analyses performed by cassette dosing in tumor-bearing animals were used to select compounds showing the highest ratio between tumor levels and cellular GI50. The drug discovery potential of lead compounds was further evaluated by monitoring target modulation in vitro

the inhibitor's core, but a wide range of substituents can be placed off of the pyrazole ring and the 5 position of the resorcinol. Accordingly, and bearing in mind the experience gained in our previous work,43­45,47 the areas that we focused on were (i) incorporation of a solubilizing group on the 4-arylpyrazole substituents, (ii) modification of the central pyrazole heterocycle, and (iii) the optimization of the 5 substituent on the resorcinol ring. Figure 4 shows compound 6 bound to the Hsp90 ATP binding site and illustrates the importance of the key interaction of the resorcinol with Asp93 and the hydrogen bond from the 5-amide substituent to Gly97.43,48 Further inspection of this structure, and others of the same structural class, indicated that the meta and para positions of the aryl group appended to the 4 position of the pyrazole were pointing toward solvent and should therefore be suitable sites for the incorporation of a solubilizing group. Thus, we initiated the synthesis of pyrazole Hsp90 inhibitors (19 and 20), incorporating CH2-amine moieties as the solubilizing functionality. Several routes to these targets were utilized (Schemes 1 and 2). Key intermediates were the p- and m-formylphenyl compounds (17 and 18), serving as precursors to reductive amination reactions (Scheme 1), or the p-aminomethyl derivative 22, as a versatile reagent for reductive amination, alkylation, conjugate addition and amide-forming reactions. The route used for the synthesis of 19e and 20a-i is shown in Scheme 1. Acetophenone 10 was made by regioselective Friedel-Crafts acylation of commercially available 4-chlororesorcinol 9. Both phenolic hydroxyls were protected with benzyl groups, generating 11 prior to the subsequent reaction of an intermediate sodium

enolate with diethyl oxalate, which afforded keto-enol ester 12. Construction of the pyrazole heterocycle 13 was achieved by reaction of 12 with hydrazine hydrate in acetic acid or hydrazine hydrochloride in ethanol. Iodination at the 4-position of the pyrazole was achieved with N-iodosuccinimide, and it was found that the reaction yield was significantly improved with the addition of a catalytic amount of ceric ammonium nitrate. Conversion of the ethyl ester moiety of 14 to the ethylamide of 16 was achieved by ester saponification, activation of resulting acid 15, and subsequent reaction with ethylamine. Compound 16 underwent a palladiumcatalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction with p- or m-formylphenylboronic acid to generate 17 and 18, respectively. Reductive amination with various amines, followed by hydrogenation to remove the benzyl groups, furnished the desired amines 19e and 20 a-i.

Compounds 19a-d and 19f,g were made using alternative procedures (Scheme 2) from the key intermediate aminomethyl derivative 22. Compound 16 was cross-coupled with 4-aminomethylboronic acid and protected in situ as the t-butyloxycarbamate derivative to aid in product isolation. Trifluoroaceticacid-mediated deprotection afforded the amine 22, which was functionalized via four distinct synthetic methodologies. Diethylamine 19a was prepared by reductive amination with acetaldehyde and subsequent debenzylation by transfer hydrogenolysis with cyclohexadiene and palladium on carbon. Sulfones 19c and 19d were prepared by vinylogous attack of the amine on methylvinylsulfone and divinylsulfone, respectively. Amides 19b and 19f were formed by a HATU49-mediated coupling procedure, and 19g utilized bis nucleophilic displacement on 2-bromoethanol. With the exception of 19a, final products were obtained by boron trichloride-mediated deprotection of the dibenzyl resorcinol. The synthesis of the isoxazoles is analogous to that used for the pyrazole series (Scheme 3). Keto-enol ester 12 was reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to give the isoxazole 23, and the subsequent conversion to final compounds utilized methods similar to those used for the corresponding pyrazoles, as outlined in Scheme 1. The amide functionality however was introduced directly from the ester prior to halogenation. N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)/ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) proved superior for bromination compared to an earlier method which used bromine in acetic acid. However, compared to pyrazole bromination, a relative increase in the amount of CAN was

necessary to effect good yields in this case. Debenzylation of 28 and 29 was accomplished with boron trichloride in preference to hydrogenation. This change was due to concerns that hydrogenation may cleave the isoxazole ring and the observation of partial (ca. 5%) 5-chlorine reduction in several reactions using catalytic hydrogenation. Some compounds of this class were made by a modified sequence, in which 25 was cross-

coupled with boronate esters having the amino functionality already present. A modification of this route was also used for making the isoxazole analogue (33) of VER-49009 (6) using the intermediate 32 (Scheme 4). The final area of interest for SAR studies described here was the 5 position on the resorcinol ring. Substituents at C-5 have the potential to induce a conformational change in the protein by forming a helix between residues 104 and 111.50 This structural change creates a lipophilic pocket in the ATP binding site of the Hsp90 protein, and we were keen to explore the influence of substituents at this position on the potency and physicochemical properties of the Hsp90 ligands. All of the 5 analogues were made from key intermediates 34 by the method outlined in Scheme 5. Differing synthetic methodologies were utilized for the synthesis of variably substituted 5-resorcinol derivatives of 34. For 5-aryl and 5-phenethyl substituents, the 5-bromo intermediate 51 (Scheme 6) was used as a substrate for Suzuki or Heck Pd-catalyzed coupling reactions. Styrene

derivatives such as 34a from Heck or Suzuki reactions of styrenes or vinylogous boronic acids were reduced prior to further manipulation. Compound 35c (Scheme 6) was subsequently used to make the 5-phenyl derivative 45 (Scheme 7), which was used for compound profiling comparisons. For the isobutyl-substituted intermediate 34e, the route outlined in Scheme 8 was used. Starting from resorcinol, a Friedel-Crafts acylation afforded acetophenone derivative 53, which was reduced51 to the sec-butyl compound 54 prior to a second Friedel-Crafts acylation and benzyl protection. Construction of the key isoxazole 34e proceeded as described above. An acetophenone derivative was also used in the route to the isopropyl-substituted intermediate 34f (Scheme 9). In this case however, a Wittig reaction was followed by hydrogenation to generate the 5-isopropyl substituent (47­59, Scheme 9). The reduction of the styrene functionality in 58 caused concomitant debenzylation. However, the resorcinol 59 acylated in better yield than the corresponding benzyl-protected substrate; therefore, reprotection was delayed until the subsequent step. The 5-ethyl-substituted compounds (such as 34d) were made from 4-ethylresorcinol by the same route as that used for the 5-chlororesorcinol outlined in Scheme 3 (see also Scheme 10).

For the introduction of a 5-tert-butyl group, Friedel-Crafts alkylation methodology was applied (Scheme 10), utilizing the tert-butyl cation generated from tert-butanol to afford acetophenone 65g. Conversion to 34g was accomplished in a similar fashion as that described previously for compound 24 (Scheme 3). Results and Discussion Using the routes outlined in Schemes 1 and 2, we synthesized a number of pyrazoles incorporating solubilizing groups on the 4-aryl group (Table 2). For substituents in the para position of the 4-aryl group, in some cases, both enzyme potency and cellular GI50 values (19e and 19f) were similar to those of VER49009 (6). However, in most instances, these diverse analogues were less potent than 6. For compounds with aminomethyl groups at the meta position (20a-i), none of the examples matched the binding affinity of compound 6 in the FP assay or in the cell growth inhibition assay with HCT116 cells. Thus, although the crystal structure of 6 suggested that there was space to introduce solubilizing groups off of the 4-aryl substituent, it appeared that the regiochemistry and nature of the solubilizing

group had an effect on how well this substitution was tolerated in these pyrazole analogues. Examination of the binding for the pyrazole ring in ligands such as 6 demonstrated that the polar interactions deep inside of the binding site are very well matched between the protein and ligand. With this in mind, it was clear to us that very little steric change would be tolerated in this region. The nitrogen adjacent to the resorcinol (N1) is involved in hydrogen bonding with the key Asp93/water network at the base of the pocket as an H-bond acceptor. We felt that an alternative hydrogen-bond acceptor such as oxygen might be advantageous. Pyrazoles can exist in tautomeric forms, and when N1 is protonated, this represents a form which is unlikely to bind well to Hsp90. Further, the interaction between N2 and the amide backbone carbonyl of Gly97 is not in the ideal geometry. Therefore, fixing the position designated N1 as a 100% H-bond acceptor was considered to be a preferred feature, with the N2 position being less critical. We desired to achieve such a subtle change while keeping the other carbon positions already substituted with key functionality in a defined orientation for binding. Isoxazoles and pyrazoles differ in that the former does not bear hydrogen on a heteroatom and can therefore not be substituted. As a consequence, the isoxazole is also smaller in size and should still be accommodated in the binding site. In addition, there is no possibility of the existence of isomeric forms that can exist with the pyrazole. Evaluation of the binding of the isoxazole analogue 33 (Scheme 4) of the pyrazole 6 to Hsp90 protein gave an IC50 value of 28 nM, similar to that of compound 6 (25 nM). This shows that the change is tolerated, with the matched pyrazole/ isoxazole 6/33 exhibiting equipotent binding in the FP assay.

However, the advantage of the isoxazole over the pyrazole scaffold became apparent when we looked at the activity of 6 versus 33 in cell growth inhibition assays across a range of human cancer cell lines (Table 3). These data demonstrated a trend for higher potency (with respect to cell growth inhibition) for the isoxazole 33. The interactions of pyrazole 6 and isoxazole 33 with Hsp90 were studied previously by isothermal calorimetry,47 which showed that the isoxazole-Hsp90 complex is marginally more stable than the corresponding pyrazole complex and that the difference is predominantly due to the enthalpy difference. Kinetic analysis by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) has shown that, although these compounds have similar Kon values (6.4 × 105 and 8.2 × 105 M-1 s-1) for 33 and 6, respectively, the Koff for isoxazole 33 of 4.05 × 10-4 s-1 is 10-fold slower than that of 5.64 × 10-3 s-1 for pyrazole 6. These combined data can help account for the increased cellular potency of the isoxazole and also help rationalize the measured four-fold higher concentrations of 33 compared to 6 recently shown in HCT116 cells. This was also sufficient for the isoxazole 33 to demonstrate the first signs of in vivo efficacy in a xenograft tumor model, as reported previously.47 The pyrazole to isoxazole scaffold change was next combined with solubilizing group incorporation on the 4-aryl ring. Table 4. shows data for a series of diarylisoxazoles, substituted with a range of amine-bearing substituents predominantly on the para position of the 4-aryl ring. It was clear that the pyrazole to isoxazole switch was very well tolerated in this series of compounds and that the preference for substitution at the para position of the 4-aryl ring compared to the meta position seen with analogous pyrazole series was maintained. All of the parasubstituted examples had sub-70 nM IC50 values in the binding assay and were at least equipotent with analogous pyrazoles (30a vs 19d, 30b vs 19c, and 30f vs 19a). The meta-substituted compounds 31a, 31b, and 31c were less potent, as was also observed in the pyrazole series, but when comparing analogous pyrazole analogues (31a vs 20a and 31c vs 20f), the isoxazoles were more potent. Most importantly, the significant improved inhibition of cell proliferation seen with isoxazole 33 compared to that of pyrazole 6 was retained in this subseries (Table 4). Thus 30d, 30f, 30g, and 30k have sub-100 nM GI50 values against HCT116 cells.

We next turned our attention to the 5 position of the resorcinol. We had previously shown43 that the removal of ethyl or chloro from this position resulted in a 20-fold decrease in

Groups such as phenethyl (40i, 40j, and 41i) and phenyl (40c, 41c, and 41m) retain binding affinity similar to those of the chloro analogues, such as 30d, or small alkyl-substituted analogues, such as 42d and 42f. Additionally, these analogues demonstrated excellent

potency in cell growth inhibition assays, as demonstrated by a number of the compounds in Table 5, in particular, the 5-isopropyl analogues 40f and 42f. To evaluate the importance of the resorcinol OH moieties in the binding of this class of inhibitor, several O-methylated analogues of the 5-ethyl compound 40d were synthesized. As demonstrated in Table 6, O-methylation at C-2 caused a large drop in binding affinity. O-Methylation at C-4 was tolerated, but compound 70 had reduced potency and cellular activity and thus demonstrated no advantage over the free resorcinol. At all stages in the optimization process, X-ray crystal structures were obtained with ligands bound to the N-terminal domain of Hsp90R to confirm that the changes made in the elaboration of 6 had not altered the binding mode of the ligands. Figure 5shows an overlay of the X-ray structures of 6 and the isoxazole 40f.52 The structural data for 40f demonstrate an

equivalent binding mode as we previously reported41,43,47 for 5, 6, and 33, with the same network of hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the resorcinol moiety and the heterocyclic ring with Asp93, Thr184, and a cluster of structurally conserved and highly ordered water molecules. The isoxazole 3-amide group in compound 40f makes the same hydrogen-bond interactions with the protein backbone via Gly97 as that seen with 6 and 33, as well as a further interaction with Lys58, but as previously reported, the latter reaction does not significantly contribute to the binding free energy.43,48 Replacement of the chlorine of the resorcinol ring in 6 or 30d53 by an isopropyl group in 40f results in an additional hydrophobic interaction with Leu107 in the flexible lipophilic pocket, and additional hydrophobic interactions are also seen with Thr109 and Gly135 from the morpholine moiety present in 40f. It was important to establish that the new ligands retained the well-established molecular signature of known Hsp90 inhibitors with respect to the effect of the ligands on cellular markers. Figure 6shows that the pyrazoles 6 and 19e and the isoxazoles 33, 30d, and 40f gave the expected depletion of the client proteins Raf-1 and Her2 and induction of Hsp72 in HCT116 cells in vitro, as determined by western blots at 1 and 2 × GI50 concentrations. These results support the premise that the effects on cell growth were a consequence of Hsp90 chaperone inhibition. We had previously shown54 that the resorcinol moiety was glucuronidated but that in vitro microsomal metabolism rates were not predictive of the plasma clearance of this chemical series. Preferred compounds from the foregoing research were therefore further characterized in vivo using cassette dosing to mice bearing subcutaneous HCT116 human colon cancer xenografts, followed by quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis in various tissues.54,55 The method was first validated by comparing results for a set of five compounds dosed singly and in mixture

by measuring tumor concentrations 6 h post administration. Concentrations in tumors were similar in both experiments (Figure 7), with the same rank order, suggesting that compoundcompound interactions were not significant. In subsequent studies, selected compounds were administered i.p. in cassettes of five compounds to tumor-bearing mice at a dose of 4 mg/kg each. Table 7. shows a summary of three cassettes dosed with some of the most potent diarylisoxazole amides. Table 8 shows some additional pharmacodynamic (PK) parameters for cassette dosing experiment 3. The pharmacokinetic standard used, 33, gave consistent results for tumor levels but exhibited variable plasma concentrations (up to 60% between cassettes 1 and 3). Overall, tumor-to-plasma ratios were found to vary from 0.3 to 20. Compounds with aliphatic substituents such as ethyl (40d) and isopropyl (40f) in the 5 position of the resorcinol had higher tumor exposure than compounds with aromatic substituents (such as 40b, 41i, and 41m). The 5-phenyl derivative 43c had

a comparatively high tumor concentration but still higher plasma levels. The 5-chloro compounds also achieved high tumor concentrations (30f, 30g and 30c). The isopropyl analogue 40f clearly showed the highest ratio of tumor concentration to cellular GI50 (up to 35-fold), with a half-life of 9.5 h in the tumor, and this compound was therefore taken forward for further study. Isoxazole 40f showed potent antiproliferative effects in a range of human cancer cell lines (Table 9), and the expected depletion of client proteins and induction of Hsp72 were observed in all of the cell lines examined (data not shown). Compound 40f was administered at 50 mg/kg daily i.p. to

athymic mice bearing HCT116 human colon carcinoma xenografts. The rate of tumor growth was significantly inhibited by 40f administration (Figure 8A), and treated tumor weights measured at day 12 were 49.8% of the control values (Figure 8B). This dose schedule was well-tolerated, with no body weight losses (Figure 8C), and the pharmacodynamic (PD) marker changes at the end of the study were consistent with Hsp90 inhibition (Figure 8D). Conclusion A significant reduction of tumor growth in HCT116 colon cancer xenografts was observed with the potent Hsp90 inhibitor VER-52296/NVP-AUY92259 (40f). This compound has excellent potency against Hsp90 in a FP binding assay (IC50 ) 21 nM) and inhibits proliferation in a wide range of human cancer cell lines with an average GI50 of 9 nM. Treated cells show the characteristic molecular signature of Hsp90 inhibition, namely, elevation of Hsp72 and degradation of oncogenic client proteins. The compound is retained in HCT116 xenograft tumors at concentrations well above the GI50, with a half-life of 9.5 h following i.p. administration at 50 mg/kg qd. The identification of 40f as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of cancer was strongly influenced by X-ray structures of protein-inhibitor complexes and was the culmination of studies that optimized the physical and biological properties of lead compounds, including, in particular, tumor drug levels. In addition, 40f showed excellent efficacy in a range of subcutaneous and orthotopic human tumor xenograft models covering major cancer types and diverse oncogenic profiles, and these data will be published elsewhere.56 The overall properties warrant further studies of this compound, and an i.v. formulation of NVPAUY922 (40f) is currently in a Phase-I study in patients with a range of cancer indications. Experimental Section
Fluorescence Polarization Assay. The ability of compounds to compete with a fluorescently labeled probe for binding to full-length human Hsp90 was determined, as described previously,57 with a modified probe (VER-00051001). This probe binds with greater affinity to Hsp90 than that described previously, allowing the accurate determination of IC50 for higher-affinity compounds. Synthetic procedures for VER-00051001 and details relating to the FP assay can be found in the Supporting Information section. Cell Growth and Client Protein Degradation. Growth inhibition assays using the SRB method were undertaken as previously described.27 Client protein degradation was determined by western blotting. In brief, HCT116 cells were exposed to compounds 6, 19e, 30d, 33, 40f, or 17-AAG at either 1× or 2× their cellular GI50 for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared in 50 mM tris-HCl and 2% SDS (pH 6.8), and protein levels were determined by the BCA method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of lysate were separated by SDS-PAGE and proteins transferred to PVDF membrane. Her2 (ab8054, Abcam), Raf-1 (sc-133, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Hsp72 (SPA-810, StressGen) were determined using ECL (GE Bioscience). GAPDH (MAB374, Chemicon International) levels were determined to show equal protein loading. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism. Cassette Dosing in Tumor-Bearing Mice. All work was performed in accordance with the Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and according to the UKCCCR guidelines for animal experimentation.58 HCT116 human colon cancer cells were cultured in DMEM plus 5% fetal calf serum. When 80% confluent, they were released from plastic flasks by a short exposure to trypsin, washed, and re-suspended in PBS. Two million cells were injected s.c. bilaterally in the flanks of female NCr athymic mice. Dosing commenced when tumors were well established, 4­5

mm mean diameter for therapy and 8­9 mm for cassette dosing pharmacokinetic studies. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted in sterile saline/Tween 20 such that animals received the dose required in 0.1 mL of final solution per 10 g of body weight. Final concentrations were 10% DMSO, 5% Tween 20, and 85% saline. The compound was stable in this vehicle and, for repeat dosing in the therapy study, was stored for 3­4 days at 4 °C between doses. Controls received an equal volume of vehicle. For cassette dosing, animals received 4 mg/kg of each compound. The approach used was consistent with the guidelines for cassette dosing that we have published previously55 and our prior experience with early pyrazole-resorcinol Hsp90 inhibitors.54 The plasma and tumors were taken as previously described54 at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h post administration (N ) 3 animals per time point) and snap frozen. Quantitative analysis of the plasma and tumors was performed by LC/MS/MS. The LC system comprised a Waters Alliance 2795 separations module (Hertford, U.K.). Chromatography was achieved on a Synergi Polar-RP 4µ 50 × 2.1 mm column (Phenomenex, Macclesfield, U.K.) with an A100-X precolumn filter (Anachem, Luton, Bedfordshire, UK). The mobile phase, initially containing 0.1% formic acid and methanol, 80/20 v/v, was increased linearly to 90% methanol from 0 to 6 min, kept isocratic for 5 min, and then washed with 100% methanol for 1 min before returning to the initial conditions. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min. Detection was achieved on a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Manchester, U.K.). The electrospray interface was used in negative-ionization mode (ES-) with a capillary voltage of 4 kV and a source temperature of 200 °C. Detection was accomplished by multiple reaction monitoring of the optimized transitions and collision energy for each of the six compounds (five compounds and an analytical internal standard). The program WinNonlin was used to evaluate the half life of test compounds. Therapeutic Activity in Human Tumor Xenografts. The compound 40f was prepared as described below. Therapy was initiated when tumors were established with a mean diameter of 4­5 mm and continued for 12 days. The dose selected (50 mg/kg) had been shown in pilot studies to be well-tolerated and to give plasma levels within the therapeutic range. Tumors were measured three times weekly and weighed when excised at the end of the experiment. Animals were weighed daily as an indication of general health. Tumor samples were also collected for analysis of pharmacodynamic biomarkers, as described earlier. Chemistry. 1-(5-Chloro-2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethanone (10). Acetic acid (17.5 mL) was added dropwise to a suspension of 4-chlorobenzene-1,3-diol (42.5 g, 0.294 mol) in BF3 · OEt2 (200 mL, 1.62 mol) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated at 90 °C for 3.5 h and then allowed to cool to room temperature, causing a solid to precipitate. The mixture was poured into a 10% w/v aqueous sodium acetate solution (700 mL). This mixture was then stirred vigorously for 2.5 h to afford a lightbrown solid, which was filtered, washed with water, and air-dried overnight to afford the title compound 10 (31.6 g, 58%): TLC Rf ) 0.40 (1:3 EtOAc/hexane); LCMS tR ) 1.75 min; m/z ) 185[M - H]-; 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6)  2.70 (s, 3H), 6.62 (s, 1H), 8.03 (s, 1H), 11.45 (s, 1H), 12.35 (s, 1H); 13C R (100.6 MHz, DMSO-d6)  27.0 (CH3), 103.5 (CH), 111.4 (C), 113.6 (C), 132.6 (CH), 159.9 (CH), 162.1 (C), 202.1 (C);  ) 3257, 1608 cm-1. 1-(2,4-Bis(benzyloxy)-5-chlorophenyl)ethanone (11).

The mixture was heated at reflux for 6 h and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature and stirred overnight. The mixture was filtered, and the solids were washed with dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic filtrates were evaporated in vacuo to leave a paleyellow solid, which was triturated with a mixture of hexane (350 mL)/EtOAc (15 mL) and filtered to give the title compound 11 (35.4 g, 90% yield) as an off-white solid: TLC Rf ) 0.33 (1:4

Method a: Compound 12 (20 g, 42.8 mmol) was added portionwise to cooled glacial acetic acid (100 mL) with mechanical stirring under nitrogen, with the temperature maintained at 14 °C with an ice bath. The suspension was treated dropwise with hydrazine hydrate (2.4 mL, 47.2 mmol). The cooling was removed at the initiation of freezing in order to maintain stirring, and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature over 3 h during continued stirring.
