The N-terminus of all actins so far studied is acetylated. Although the pathways of acetylation have been well studied, its functional importance has been unclear. A negative charge cluster in the actin N-terminal region is shown to be important for the function of actomyosin. Acetylation at the N-terminus removes a positive charge and increases the amount of net negative charges in the N-terminal region. This may augment the role of the negative charge cluster. To examine this possibility, actin with a nonacetylated N-terminus (nonacetylated actin) was produced. The nonacetylated actin polymerized and depolymerized normally. In actin-activated heavy meromyosin ATPase assays, the nonacetylated actin showed higher K app without significantly changing V max, compared with those of wild-type actin. This is in contrast to the effect of the N-terminal negative charge cluster, which increases V max without changing K app. These results indicate that the acetylation at the N-terminus of actin strengthens weak actomyosin interaction. © 2000

The N-terminus of all actins so far studied is acetylated as the result of actin N-terminal processing, whose pathways have been well studied. Actins are divided into two classes on the basis of the nucleotide sequences encoding their N-termini. Each class has different pathway of processing. For class I actins, such as Dictyostelium actin and -actin, the N-terminal sequence is Met-Asp(Glu)- on their genes, whereas the sequence is N-acetyl-Asp(Glu)- on mature actin. The methionyl residue at its N-terminus is acetylated after the translation and removed as N-acetylmethionine.

Then, the newly generated amino group is acetylated (1). The genes for class II actins, such as skeletal muscle actin and Drosophila actin, usually encode MetCys-Asp(Glu)- for their N-termini, whereas the mature class II actins have N-acetyl-Asp(Glu)- sequences. During the translation, unmodified methionine is removed from the N-terminus and the cysteinyl residue that newly becomes the N-terminus is acetylated. After the translation, the N-acetylcysteine is removed and the N-terminal acetylation occurs again (2). The factors that promote the N-terminal processing of actin should be specific to actin for the following reasons. (I) Usually, N-terminal acetylation occurs in the case that the amino acid residue at the N-terminus is alanine, threonine, serine, glycine, or methionine (3). However, actin has a negatively charged residue (Asp or Glu) at its acetylated N-terminus. (II) In general, methionine is removed from the N-terminus of a protein if the next residue is small and uncharged (3). However, the N-terminal methionine of class I actin is removed even if the side chain of the second residue has a negative charge. (III) N-acetylaminopeptidase that is specific to actin has been isolated from rat liver (4). These facts suggest that the N-terminal acetylation of actin through the processing should be important for the function of actin. However, the functional importance has been unclear. On the other hand, the N-terminal sequence 1­ 4 of actins is rich in acidic amino acid residues and forms a negative charge cluster. The sequences are, for example, Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Asp-Glu- for rabbit skeletal muscle actin and Acetyl-Asp-Gly-Glu-Asp- for Dictyostelium discoideum actin. The previous studies have revealed that the negative charge cluster in actin N-terminal amino acid residues 1­ 4 are important for the function of actomyosin (5­13). It increases V max of actin-activated ATPase of myosin without changing K app appreciably. N-terminal acetylation may contribute to such an effect, because it increases the number of net negative charges in the N-terminal region of actin by removing a positive charge from the N-terminal -amino group.

BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS with factor Xa at a ratio of 1:20 (w/w) and was dialyzed against G buffer at room temperature for 2 days. The reaction was stopped by adding a 10,000-fold molar excess of p-APMSF over factor Xa. Fragments containing 10-histidine tag and factor Xa recognition sequence, and undigested H 10Xa-actin were removed by stirring the solution for 2 h with Ni­NTA agarose equilibrated with G buffer. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed against 20 mM imidazole­HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM ATP, and 1 mM -mercaptoethanol overnight. The resulting F-actin was ultracentrifuged at 541,000g for 30 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The F-actin pellet was resuspended in 10 mM imidazole­ HCl, pH 7.0, 0.2 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM ATP, and 1 mM -mercaptoethanol, and dialyzed against the same solvent overnight. The resulting solution was finally cleared by ultracentrifugation at 436,000g for 10 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant contained the homogeneous non-acetylated actin. The yield of the purified actin was 300 g from a 1-L culture. Wild-type actin was prepared from Ax2 cells as described (6). Rabbit skeletal actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle acetone powder (20). Myosin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (21). Heavy meromyosin (HMM) and myosin subfragment-1 (S1) was obtained by digesting myosin with chymotrypsin following the procedure described previously (22, 23). ATPase measurements. ATPase activities were measured as described (6) in 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM imidazole­HCl, pH 7.0, 4 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM ATP, 5 g/ml phalloidin, 0.03 mg/ml HMM, and 0 ­50 M actin at 25°C. Liberated phosphate was measured by the malachite green method (24). Electron microscopy. Polymerized actin for electron microscopy was formed in 10 mM imidazole­HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, and 1 mM DTT at 25°C for 2 h. The polymerized actin was mounted on carbon film and negatively stained with NanoVan, pH 8.0. Electron micrographs were taken at an instrumental magnification of 30,000 on Kodak SO163 film with Hitachi HF2000 electron microscope operated at 200 kV. The electron dose was about 15 e /Å 2. Other procedures. SDS­PAGE was done on 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels (25), and gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out by the method of O'Farrel (26) and Mikawa et al. (27). The first dimension (isoelectric focusing) was performed in the presence of 9 M urea. The second dimension was SDS­PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Protein concentration of rabbit skeletal actin, HMM, and S1 was measured by determining absorbance at 280 nm with the extinction coefficient as 11.1 cm 1 (1%) (28), 6.0 cm 1 (1%), and 7.5 cm 1 (1%) (29), respectively. Protein concentration of wild-type and the non-acetylated actin was measured by the Bradford method (30) according to Read and Northcote (31) with rabbit skeletal actin as standard. Binding of myosin subfragment-1 (S1) to non-acetylated actin filaments in the absence of ATP was examined by cosedimentation experiments. Mixture composed of 50 mM KCl, 10 mM imidazole­ HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mM MgCl 2, and 1 mM DTT, 0.87 M S1 were ultracentrifuged in the presence or absence of 7.5 M nonacetylated actin at 4°C for 10 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The resulting pellets were resuspended in the same buffer in volumes equal to those of the supernatants, and then samples of both supernatants and resuspended pellets were subjected to SDS­PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.

To examine this possibility, we have produced actin with nonacetylated N-terminus (nonacetylated actin) and compared its biochemical properties with those of wild-type actin. To prepare the nonacetylated actin, Dictyostelium actin to which 10-histidine tag and a factor Xa recognition sequence (-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-) were genetically added at its N-terminus was isolated and digested with factor Xa. Having the unblocked N-terminus, the obtained actin was the same as the non-acetylated actin. The nonacetylated actin formed normal filaments, bound myosin subfragment-1 (S1) strongly, and activated heavy meromyosin (HMM) ATPase. Compared with wild-type actin, the nonacetylated actin showed higher K app without significantly changing V max. Thus, the effect of the N-terminal acetylation of actin on actomyosin ATPase cycle cannot be explained by its effect on the charges of the N-terminal region. The effect of the acetylation at the N-terminus of actin is different: it facilitates the weak interaction between actin and myosin in actomyosin ATPase cycle. Some of the present results have been reported in a preliminary form (14). MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. Ni­NTA agarose was purchased from Qiagen. Factor Xa was purchased from New England Biolabs. An anti-actin polyclonal antibody A2066 and p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (p-APMSF) were purchased from Sigma. NanoVan was purchased from Nanoprobes. Plasmid construction. The coding sequence of both 10-histidine tag and factor Xa recognition sequence (-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-) was inserted into the actin 15 gene (15) immediately after the start codon by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (16). This 10-histidinetagged actin with factor Xa recognition sequence at its N-terminus was designated as H 10Xa-actin. A transformation vector was constructed by inserting the mutant actin 15 gene into an extrachromosomal vector pBIG (17) as described (18). Transformation of Dictyostelium cells. The transformation vector was introduced into Dictyostelium cells by electroporation (19). Transformed cells were selected by culturing them in the presence of G418 (neomycin analogue) as described (6). The expression of H 10Xaactin was confirmed by SDS­PAGE because the addition of 10histidine tag and factor Xa recognition sequence to the N-terminus of actin increased the molecular weight of actin. Preparation of proteins. All procedures were carried out on ice or at 4°C unless otherwise stated. When the number of Dictyostelium cells expressing H 10Xa-actin reached 1 10 10 in 4-L culture (2.5 10 6/mL), the cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were then washed twice with G buffer (20 mM imidazole-acetate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM calcium acetate, 0.5 mM ATP, and 1 mM -mercaptoethanol) and finally suspended in G buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.02 mg/ml chymostatin, and 0.02 mg/ml pepstatin. The suspended cells were sonicated for six 10-s periods and centrifuged at 25,000g for 30 min. The supernatant was stirred for 2 h with Ni­NTA agarose equilibrated with G buffer. The resin was washed with G buffer five times to remove unbound proteins, including wild-type actin. H 10Xa-actin was eluted by suspending the resin in 200 mM imidazole­acetate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mM calcium acetate, 0.5 mM ATP, and 1 mM -mercaptoethanol. Then, H 10Xa-actin was mixed 15

whole lysate prepared from cells transformed with a vector containing H 10Xa-actin gene (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). We concluded that the polypeptide was H 10Xaactin, because the polypeptide reacted with an antibody raised against the C-terminal amino acid residues 365­375 of actin (data not shown), and because it attached to and detached from Ni­NTA resin, depending on the concentration of imidazole. H 10Xa-actin was completely separated from wildtype actin with Ni­NTA resin (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The elution of H 10Xa-actin from Ni­NTA resin was usually carried out keeping its concentration as low as 0.1­ 0.3 mg/ml, because H 10Xa-actin aggregated at higher concentration when the concentration of imidazole was 200 mM. Because the proteolytic activity of factor Xa was inhibited by 200 mM imidazole, H 10Xa-actin was digested at low imidazole concentration (20 mM). At this concentration of imidazole, H 10Xa-actin was soluble up to about 0.1 mg/ml. Hence, the concentration of H 10Xaactin was kept 0.1 mg/ml or less during the digestion. Under these conditions, about half amount of H 10Xaactin was digested with factor Xa to generate the nonacetylated actin. The undigested H 10Xa-actin, and fragments containing 10-histidine tag and factor Xa recognition sequence were removed with Ni­NTA resin. Finally, a polymerization­ depolymerization cy16

cle was done to separate the non-acetylated actin from factor Xa (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The nonacetylated actin did not aggregate any more even under the conditions mentioned above. On the other hand, a similar tendency to aggregate was observed for actin with 10-histidine tag and without factor Xa recognition sequence at its N-terminus. Therefore, the aggregation of H 10Xa-actin was probably due to the existence of 10-histidine tag at its N-terminus. Two-dimensional electrophoretic patterns of purified wild-type or nonacetylated actin, or the mixture of them revealed that the nonacetylated actin was more basic than wild-type actin, as expected (Fig. 1B). The nonacetylated actin polymerized and depolymerized normally. Figure 2 shows an electron micrograph of the nonacetylated actin filaments. The crossover periods were about 36 nm, indicating that the nonacetylated actin formed normal filaments. Myosin subfragment-1 cosedimentated with nonacetylated actin filaments in the absence of ATP (Fig. 1C). This means that the nonacetylated actin forms rigor complex with myosin.

DISCUSSION We have found that the N-terminal acetylation of actin decreases K app (dissociation constant) of actoHMM ATPase and keeps V max almost unaffected. Considering these results, we compare the effect of the acetylation with that of the N-terminal negative charge cluster of actin. Preparation of Nonacetylated Actin We have succeeded in expressing and purifying N-terminal 10-histidine-tagged Dictyostelium actin with factor Xa recognition sequence (H 10Xa-actin). Our affinity-chromatographic method has realized separation of mutant actins not separable from wild-type actin by the previous method utilizing anion exchange chromatography (6, 12, 32). Unlike the previous histidine-tagged actin (33), H 10Xa-actin has a cleavable histidine tag. Because the nonacetylated actin generated from H 10Xa-actin differs from wild-type actin only in its nonacetylated N-terminus, it has enabled unambiguous elucidation of the functional importance of the acetylation, in contrast to previous nonacetylated actins (10, 34 ­37). Actin-Activated ATPase Activity of HMM

V max of acto-HMM ATPase was almost unchanged whether the N-terminus was acetylated or not, indicating that the effect of the acetylation on the extent of

type or the nonacetylated actin filaments. Figure 3 shows the results as an Eadie­Hofstee plot. The V max and K app values were obtained from this plot. V max is the maximum turnover rate of acto-HMM ATPase at infinite actin concentration and means the maximum extent of the activation of myosin ATPase by actin. The intercept on the ordinate of Fig. 3 corresponds to V max. The V max value for wild-type actin was 13.5 1.0 s 1, and that for the nonacetylated actin was 17.4 2.0 s 1. Namely, the V max values showed that the difference between the two actins is not so significant. K app is the concentration of actin that gives the half rate of V max of acto-HMM ATPase. This means that 1/K app represents the apparent affinity between actin and HMM in the presence of ATP, that is, the extent of weak interaction between the two proteins. The slope of Fig. 3 corresponds to K app. The K app value for wildtype actin was 25.5 3.0 M, and that for the nonacetylated actin was 91.9 12.8 M. Namely, the K app value for the nonacetylated actin was 3.6 times larger than that for wild-type actin, indicating that the acetylation at the N-terminus of actin strengthens weak interaction between actin and myosin during actomyosin ATPase cycle.

FIG. 3. Eadie­Hofstee plot of the actin-activated ATPase of HMM for wild-type (circles) or the nonacetylated actin (squares). The ATPase activity was measured in 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM imidazole­ HCl, pH 7.0, 4 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM ATP, 5 g/ml phalloidin, 0.03 mg/ml HMM, and 0 ­50 M actin at 25°C. The intercept on the ordinate, and the slope represent V max and K app, respectively. The V max value for wild-type actin was 13.5 1.0 s 1, and that for the non-acetylated actin was 17.4 2.0 s 1. The K app value for wild-type actin was 25.5 3.0 M, and that for the nonacetylated actin was 91.9 12.8 M, indicating that the acetylation at the N-terminus of actin strengthens weak interaction between actin and myosin in the presence of ATP.

the number of the negative charges. On the other hand, the nonacetylated actin showed much lower 1/K app (Fig. 4B). Namely, weak interaction of the nonacetylated actin with myosin is much lower than expected. These results suggest that the effect of the acetylation at the N-terminus of actin on actomyosin interaction is different from that of the N-terminal negative charge cluster. The hydrophobicity of the nonacetylated N-terminus should be smaller than that of the acetylated one, because the N-terminal a-amino group has a positive ´ charge and the hydrophobic acetyl group is removed. This decrease in hydrophobicity may be related to the unexpected decrease in the weak interaction. In the weakly bound complex, the positive charge may be screened, possibly, by myosin residues so that the N-terminal three negative charges can activate myosin ATPase normally. This may result in the almost unchanged V max. In conclusion, the N-terminal acetylation of actin increases weak actomyosin interaction about 3.6 times without significantly affecting the maximum extent of actin-activation of myosin ATPase. These results are specific to the N-terminal acetylation and cannot be accounted for by changes of negative charges in the N-terminal region.
FIG. 4. Comparison of kinetic parameters of acto-HMM ATPase reaction between the nonacetylated actin (squares) and Dictyostelium wild-type or N-terminal mutant actins (circles). V max (A) and 1/K app (B) normalized with the values for wild-type actin as unit were plotted against the number of net negative charges in actin N-terminal residues 1­ 4. The mutant actins plotted were D1H and D1H/D4H (6). The number of net charges at pH 7.0 was calculated as described (38) to obtain 3.0 for wild type, 1.9 for D1H, 0.82 for D1H/D4H, and 2.0 for the nonacetylated actin.

activation of myosin ATPase was small. On the other hand, the nonacetylated actin showed 3.6 times higher K app than that of wild-type actin. This means that 1/K app, representing the apparent affinity between actin and HMM in the presence of ATP, is smaller if the N-terminus is not acetylated, and therefore indicates that the N-terminal acetylation of actin strengthens weak actomyosin interaction. Previous studies have revealed that the number of negative charges in actin N-terminal sequence 1­ 4 correlates with V max and K app (6, 7, 11­13). Figure 4A shows that V max increases dramatically as the number of negative charges rises from about 1 to 3. On the other hand, as seen from Fig. 4B, 1/K app does not show such large change. Although the charges in the sequence 1­ 4 of the non-acetylated actin was 2, it had almost the same V max as that of wild-type actin, which had 3 negative charges in the same region (Fig. 4A). This means that the activation of myosin ATPase by the nonacetylated actin is higher than expected from
