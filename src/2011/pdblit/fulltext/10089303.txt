The structure of the FKBP12±rapamycin±FRB ternary Ê complex has now been re®ned at 2.2 A resolution. The cellcycle arrest agent rapamycin binds FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) and the FKBP12±rapamycin binding (FRB) domain of FKBP12±rapamycin associated protein (FRAP) simultaneously, and the inhibition of FRAP is responsible for rapamycin's biological activity. The conformation of rapamycin in the ternary complex is very similar to that observed in the FKBP12±rapamycin binary complex, with an r.m.s. Ê difference of only 0.30 A. However, a slight (9 ) rotation repositions the FRB-binding face of rapamycin in the ternary complex. There are extensive rapamycin±protein interactions and relatively few interactions between the two protein partners FKBP12 and FRB, these interactions mainly involving residues in the 40s and 80s loops of FKBP12 and 1 and 4 of FRB. The high-resolution re®nement has revealed the crucial role of several buried waters in the formation of the ternary complex.

1. Introduction
The extraordinary natural products rapamycin (Sehgal et al., 1975) and FK506 (Kino et al., 1987) (Fig. 1) are potent immunosuppressive agents (reviewed by Schreiber, 1991). Both molecules bind with high af®nity (0.2±0.4 nM, respectively) to the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) (Harding et al., 1989; Siekierka et al., 1989) and inhibit its peptidyl±prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. The high-resolution structures of the FKBP12±rapamycin complex (Van Duyne, Standaert, Schreiber et al., 1991) and the FKBP12±FK506 complex (Van Duyne, Standaert, Karplus et al., 1991) reveal that both ligands have a very similar FKBP12-binding region, which includes the ester, pipecolinyl, cyclohexyl, pyran and tricarbonyl region (Fig. 1), and binds in a deep hydrophobic FKBP pocket comprised of conserved aromatic residues. The part of FK506 and rapamycin which projects away from FKBP has been termed the effector region (Van Duyne et al., 1993) and the effector regions of FK506 and rapamycin bear little resemblance to each other (Fig. 1). Inhibition of FKBP12's PPIase activity is not responsible for immunosuppression and PPIase inhibitors are not immunosuppressive agents. Immunosuppression is caused by the ability of FKBP12±FK506/rapamycin to inhibit key portions in cytoplasmic signal transduction cascades. The FKBP12±FK506 complex, but not the FKBP12± rapamycin complex, inhibits the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (Liu et al., 1991; O'Keefe et al., 1992; Clipstone & Crabtree, 1992). The FKBP12±rapamycin complex, but not the FKBP12±FK506 complex, inhibits a 289 kDa protein named FK506-rapamycin associated protein

(FRAP) in humans (Brown et al., 1994) and RAFT1 in rats (Sabatini et al., 1994). Therefore, rapamycin and FK506 fall into a very limited group of cell-permeable molecules which generate a gain of function in their initial protein targets (Crabtree & Schreiber, 1996), this gain of function being attributable to the ability of the small-molecule ligand to simultaneously bind two proteins. FRAP belongs to the ataxia telangiectasia mutant (ATM) family of high molecular-weight proteins which participate in cell-cycle progression, chromosome maintenance and repair, DNA recombination and cell-cycle checkpoints (Keith & Schreiber, 1995). At the C-terminal region, members of the family share varying degrees of homology to phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinases. FRAP is most highly related to two gene products from S. cerevisiae, TOR1 and TOR2 (Heitman et al., 1991). Mapping of the minimal human FKBP12-rapamycinbinding domain (FRB domain) of FRAP indicates that a small, 90 amino-acid fragment (residues 2025±2114, Kd = 4.7 nM; Chen et al., 1995) is suf®cient to confer speci®c FKBP12 binding in a rapamycin-dependent fashion. Therefore, rapamycin is able to mediate the association of two small soluble proteins, FKBP12 and FRB, and this enforced association is being exploited by the use of rapamycin to control cellular processes such as gene transcription (Rivera et al., 1996). The crystal structure of FKBP12±rapamycin in complex with the FRB domain (residues 2019±2112) has been solved by a combination of molecular replacement with isomorphous replacement for a single derivative (HgCl2) plus anomalous Ê scattering (SIRAS) at 2.7 A resolution (Choi et al., 1996). Ê Here, we report the structure re®ned at 2.2 A resolution and an analysis of interactions that are involved in this remarkable FKBP12±rapamycin±FRB ternary complex. sions 0.8 Â 0.4 Â 0.2 mm was used for data collection. Data were collected at room temperature using two San Diego multiwire area detectors and a Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode X-ray source (50 kV, 150 mA). The rod-shaped crystals belong Ê to space group P212121 with a = 46.3, b = 52.4, c = 102.0 A, and one ternary complex forms the asymmetric unit. The solvent content is 51%. No measurements were deleted and Friedel pairs were averaged. The data were reduced using SCALEPACK. Statistics for the ®nal data set are shown in Table 1.
2.2. Starting model and re®nement

Ê The 2.7 A resolution structure was used as the initial model for least-squares re®nement and simulated annealing in È X-PLOR (Brunger, 1993). Graphical ®tting (peptide-bond ¯ip, side-chain conformational change etc.) was performed using the program CHAIN (Sack, 1988). Initially, the indiviÊ dual B values were restrained to 15.0 A2 and were varied only Ê in the last cycles of re®nement. Data from 8±2.2 A were used for the re®nement without bulk-solvent modi®cation. Waters were added only after the restrained B-factor re®nement of FKBP12±rapamycin±FRB was completed. Ordered waters were added if a peak appeared in the Fo À Fc difference map with height greater than 3' and the position of the peak Ê implied at least one hydrogen bond within 4 A, either to a protein atom or to another already de®ned water molecule. All residues of FKBP12 and FRB in the ®nal model are located in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, with

2.1. Crystallization and data collection

Expression and puri®cation of recombinant human FKBP12 (Van Duyne et al., 1993) and the FRB domain of human FRAP (Chen et al., 1995) have been described. After gel-®ltration (Pharmacia HR12/6), FKBP12 was concentrated to 6 mg mlÀ1 and FRB was concentrated to 2 mg mlÀ1. Protein concentrations were measured by UV absorption. FKBP12 was mixed with rapamycin (10 mg mlÀ1 in methanol) in a 1:3 molar ratio and the mixture was stored at 277 K overnight. The mixture was then passed through a 0.22 mm ®lter unit (Millipore) to remove the insoluble rapamycin. FRB was added to the FKBP12±rapamycin complex solution in a 1:1 molar ratio. The ternary complex thus made was stored in 20 mM Tris±HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Hanging drops containing equal amounts of the FKBP12±rapamycin±FRB ternary complex and the well solution (15±20% PEG 8000, 5± 10% methylpentanediol, 100 mM Tris±HCl, pH 8.5) were set up at room temperature on an ice bucket and were stored at 277 K. Microseeding was used to ensure crystal growth, and crystals usually appeared two days after seeding and grew to maximum size in two to three weeks. A crystal with dimenActa Cryst. (1999).

The structures of rapamycin and FK506 have conventionally been divided into two regions (Fig. 1). The common FKBP-binding region interacts with FKBP, and small molecules with these structural features have PPIase activity. The effector regions of FK506 and rapamycin, which differ considerably (Van Duyne et al., 1993), interact with calcineurin and FRAP (FRB), respectively. Rapamycin is at the center of the ternary complex and uses different faces to interact with FKBP12 and FRB. FKBP12 contains a twisted -sheet (with ®ve antiparallel -strands) wrapped around a short -helix. Rapamycin binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed between the -sheet and the -helix. Three loops ± the 40s loop (a bulge in 5), the 50s loop (loop between 5 to ) and the 80s loop (loop between 2 and 3) ± surround and contribute to the binding pocket. Interactions between rapamycin and FKBP12 in the ternary complex are very similar to those in the binary complex (see Table 2) and they have been analyzed in

The importance of the 80s loop in the interactions of the ternary complex is illustrated by FKBP13 (Jin et al., 1991) and FKBP25 (Galat et al., 1991), two other members of the FKBP immunophilin family. Like FKBP12, FKBP13 and FKBP25 are PPIases with high af®nities for rapamycin and FK506. They also share high sequence identities with FKBP12. However, none of them is able to mediate the immunosuppressive activity of FK506 or rapamycin (Abraham & Wiederrecht, 1996). Structures of FKBP13±FK506 (Schultz et al., 1994) and FKBP25's FKBP12-homologous domain complexed with rapamycin (Liang et al., 1996) have been determined. FKBP13 and FKBP25's FKBP12-homologous domains have been docked to the ternary complex by superimposing the mainchain atoms. In FKBP13, the Gly89/Pro89 change creates an unfavorable steric hindrance between Pro89 and Val2094. In FKBP25, the tip of the 80s loop (Q203±K207) forms a 310 helix rather than the type II turn in FKBP12, which brings the region much closer to the regions around Val2094 in FRB, resulting in unfavorable steric clashes (Fig. 3). In contrast to the 80s loop, differences in the 40s loop in FKBP13 and FKBP25 would not interfere with FRB binding. Neither the 40s nor the 80s loops are involved in any symmetry-related contacts in the crystal lattice of the ternary complex. In the FKBP12±rapamycin binary complex, the 80s loop is heavily involved in crystal-packing interactions while the 40s loop is not. An analysis of the B-factor plot indicates that the conformation of the 40s loop is greatly stabilized in Ê the triple complex, with B factors dropping from 50 A2 to less Ê 2 (Fig. 4). The 80s loop in both complexes has similar than 20 A Ê B factors ($20 A2) and thus presumably re¯ects stabilization through crystal packing or through interaction with FRB as well as the effects of ligand binding.
3.3. Comparison of rapamycin conformations in different states

The conformation of rapamycin in the ternary complex is very similar to its conformation in the binary complex, with an Ê r.m.s. difference of 0.30 A for the non-H atoms (Fig. 5). There were no planarity constraints for torsional angles around C18± C19 and C20±C21 during the structure re®nements in both the Ê ternary complex and the binary complex. In the ®nal 2.7 A  structure of the ternary complex, rotations of À15 about C18±C19 and 37 about C20±C21 appeared to slightly disrupt the conjugation of the triene region (Choi et al., 1996). Ê However, in the 2.2 A structure, C18±C19 and C20±C21 are more planar. The torsion angle is 179 about C18±C19 and 172 about C20±C21, which agree well with the torsion angle of 177 for C18±C19 and 170 for C20± Ê C21 in the 1.7 A binary crystal structure. In comparison, the torsion angles are 176 and 172 in the unbound crystalline state (Swindells et al., 1978). The planarity of the triene arm of rapamycin is maintained in all experimentally determined structures. The orientation of rapamycin relative to FKBP12 changes slightly in the ternary complex, resulting in a relatively large displacement of the triene region (Fig. 6). When the ®tting includes rapamycin, FKBP12 main-chain atoms and side-chain atoms of residues contacting the pipecolinyl ring, rapamycin is rotated by approximately 9 relative to the body of FKBP12, resulting in tiny changes in the FKBP12-binding region but more substantial changes in the FRB-binding region, i.e. the small angular adjustment of rapamycin in the FKBP binding pocket is magni®ed by the long lever arm of the triene. The rotation is necessary for the triene region to ®t into FRB.

crystal structures. FKBP25's FKBP12-homologous domain in complex with rapamycin has been determined by X-ray diffraction (Liang et al., 1996). X-ray crystal structures of FKBP12 in complex with various rapamycin analogs have also been determined in different space groups (Luengo et al., 1995). Rapamycin molecules have been exposed to many different crystal-packing environments in these binary complexes. Using the same ®tting scheme as described above, rapamycin molecules of diverse binary complexes superimpose well with the rapamycin in the FKBP12±rapamycin binary complex and do not show the large displacement observed in ®tting the ternary complex (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the observed rotation of rapamycin relative to FKBP12 is a real movement brought out by the FRB interaction. A similar rotation of FK506 has been observed in the FKBP12±FK506±calcineurin complex (Grif®th et al., 1995). Rapamycin alone cannot bind FRB ef®ciently, while rapamycin in complex with FKBP12 binds FRB tightly (Chen et al., 1995). Conformations of rapamycin in the ternary complex, the binary complex and the unbound crystalline state (Swindells et al., 1978) are very similar (see Fig. 4), and the r.m.s. deviation between rapamycin in the ternary complex and Ê unbound rapamycin is 0.75 A, which is slightly larger than that Ê between the ternary complex and the binary complex (0.3 A). An NMR study also indicates that rapamycin in DMSO solution adopts a conformation very similar to that observed in the rapamycin crystal structure and the complexed structure (Kessler et al., 1993). In solution, exciton chirality studies have suggested that the triene region adopts a more rigid planar conformation after rapamycin is complexed with FKBP12 (Chen et al., 1994), but the implications of this for complex formation are not clear. Upon binding FRB, the B factors of most atoms of rapamycin decrease. The cyclohexyl ring and the bridging region between the binding domain and the triene arm experience the largest stabilization as judged by B-factor analysis. The structural basis for the failure to measure any binding between rapamycin and FRB is not clear at present. It is likely that cooperative hydrophobic interactions of rapamycin, FKBP12 and FRB are important, even though the interactions between FKBP12 and FRB are more limited than those between rapamycin and FRB.

exclude residues 31±34). The largest difference is localized in residues Pro88 and Gly89 between the ternary and the binary complex and in residues Arg42 and Gly51 between the ternary complex and uncomplexed FKBP12 (see Fig. 7). Solution studies of FKBP12 (Michnick et al., 1991) suggest that the 80s loop and the 40s loop do not have well de®ned solution conformations in the absence of ligand. It has also been reported that the tip of the 80s loop can be perturbed through the ligand binding and through crystal-lattice interactions (Wilson et al., 1995). In the crystal structure of the binary complex, the 80s loop is extensively involved in crystal contacts, but in crystal structures of the ternary complex and uncomplexed FKBP12, the 80s loop is not involved in such contacts. Future work will be needed to de®ne the various factors in¯uencing the 80s loop.
3.5. Water molecules in the ternary complex

rapamycin. One water plays an important role in the interaction between rapamycin and FRB. W331 mediates the hydrogen bond between Glu2032 of FRB and O8 of rapamycin. Since all of the other rapamycin±FRB interactions are hydrophobic, W331 is likely to be signi®cant for rapamycin± FRB interactions. W424 forms a complex hydrogen-bonding network with other water molecules, a common feature in protein±ligand interactions (Poornima & Dean, 1995). These three water molecules provide some additional considerations for the development of new ligands, and rapamycin analogues with groups mimicking these waters could prove useful in the future. A summary of water±protein interactions is given in Table 4.

One of the main features of this higher resolution structure analysis is the 126 water molecules found during re®nement. Ê Only 23 water molecules were found in the 2.7 A resolution structure. Most of the water molecules were found on the protein surfaces, but ten of them play an important role in protein±protein and protein±ligand interactions (Table 3). Seven of the water molecules are involved in protein±protein interactions bridging FKBP12 and FRB. Waters W316, W317, W353, W361, W368 and W397 form a hydrogen-bonding network between the 40s loop of FKBP12 and 4 of FRB. In addition, W330 bridges the 80s loop of FKBP12 and 1 of FRB. The protein±protein interactions in this complex consist mainly of water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and it is widely appreciated that bound water molecules are major contributors to the energetics of protein±protein complexes (Covell & Wallqvist, 1997). There are three waters that bridge rapamycin and its protein partners. Two of them link rapamycin and FKBP: W377 mediates the hydrogen bonding between Gln53 and O10 of rapamycin, while W424 bridges Asp37 and O7 of

4. Conclusions Ê The 2.2 A resolution structure of the FKBP12±rapamycin± FRB ternary complex reported here allows the structures of unliganded FKBP12, FRB, rapamycin and the binary FKBP12±rapamycin complex to be compared with the ternary Ê complex on an equivalent basis. The 2.2 A structure shows unequivocally that none of the molecules participating in the triple complex changes conformation upon ternary complex formation. The comparison between the binary (FKBP12± rapamycin) and ternary (FKBP12±rapamycin±FRB) complexes is the most informative. While rapamycin, the small-molecule glue holding the two proteins together, maintains its usual conformation, it does rotate through 9 relative to FKBP12 upon binding FRB. This rotation results in a very small shift of atoms in the FKBP12-binding pocket but a larger shift in the atoms interacting with FRB. The methyl group Ê most deeply buried in the FRB-binding pocket is 1.6 A away from its position in the binary complex. In FKBP12, only Ê Pro88 and Gly89 move by more than 1 A between the binary and tertiary complexes, and their position in the ternary complex is similar to that in unliganded FKBP12 (Schultz & Clardy, 1998). If the comparison is made between unliganded FKBP12 and FKBP12 in the ternary complex, both Arg42 and Ê Gly52 move by more than 1 A. Taken together, these comparisons suggest that the loop regions of FKBP12, especially the 80s loop and the 40s loop, are more ¯exible than Ê other regions of FKBP12. The 2.2 A structure also clari®es the role of water in complex formation. Seven well ordered waters are involved in protein±protein interactions and three of them moderate interactions of rapamycin with the proteins. Finally, Ê the 2.2 A structure gives a clearer de®nition of features that will be especially signi®cant for structure-based drug design attempts to modify rapamycin.
