Riboflavin is an essential cofactor in all organisms. Its direct biosynthetic precursor, 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine, is synthesised by the enzyme 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase. Recently, we have found that the enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe binds riboflavin, the final product of the pathway with a relatively high affinity with a KD of 1.2 mM. Here, we report on the crystal structure of lumazine synthase from S. pombe with bound riboflavin and compare the binding mode with those of the substrate analogue inhibitor 5-nitro-6-(D -ribitylamino)2,4(1H,3H )-pyrimidinedione and of the product analogue 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine. In all complexes the pyrimidinedione moieties of each respective ligand bind in a very similar orientation. Binding of riboflavin additionally involves a stacking interaction of the dimethylbenzene moiety with the side-chain of His94, a highly conserved residue in all lumazine synthases. The enzyme from Bacillus subtilis showed a KD of at least 1 mM whereas the very homologous enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae had a comparable KD of 3.9 mM. Structural comparison of the S. cerevisiae, the S. pombe, and the mutant enzymes suggests that fine tuning of affinity is achieved by influencing this stacking interaction.

Introduction
The xylene ring of the vitamin, riboflavin, is assembled from two molecules of 3,4-dihydroxy-2butanone 4-phosphate (2) in two consecutive steps (Figure 1).1 ­ 6 Initially, 2 condenses with 5-amino-6(D -ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H )-pyrimidinedione (1) to form 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine (3). The product 3 undergoes an unusual dismutation reaction resulting in formation of one equivalent of riboflavin (4) accompanied by the regeneration of one equivalent of 1. The condensation of the carbohydrate derivative 2 with 1 is catalysed by lumazine synthase. The

enzyme-catalysed reaction is assumed to begin with the formation of a Schiff base (5) between the carbonyl group of 2 and the 5-amino group of 1. Following the elimination of inorganic phosphate from the intermediate, the pyrazine ring of 6 can be closed by a nucleophilic attack of the position 6 amino group of intermediate 7 on the position 5 side-chain (Figure 2). The structure of lumazine synthases has been studied in some detail. The enzymes from Bacillus subtilis,7 ­ 12 Aquifex aeolicus,13 Escherichia coli14 and spinach15 form icosahedral capsids comprising 60 identical subunits which are best described as dodecamers of pentamers. The icosahedral capsids of B. subtilis as well as of other Bacillaceae enclose homotrimeric riboflavin synthase in the core space.7,8 This unusual topology is conducive to substrate channelling resulting in enhanced catalytic efficiency at low substrate concentration.6 More recently, the lumazine synthases from S. cerevisiae,16 Magnaporte grisea15 and Brucella

abortus17 have been found to be homopentamers whose topology is closely similar to that of the pentameric modules in the icosahedral enzymes. In all lumazine synthases studied, the topologically equivalent active sites are located at the interfaces between adjacent subunits in the pentameric modules. Pathogenic enterobacteria18 and probably pathogenic yeasts19,20 are unable to incorporate riboflavin from the environment and are therefore absolutely dependent on endogenous synthesis of the vitamin. Recent genomic studies suggest that the riboflavin pathway is also essential for

Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. Therefore, the enzymes of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathways represent potential targets for anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents. Recently, we have found that recombinant lumazine synthase from Schizosaccharomyces pombe is isolated with bound riboflavin, the final product of the biosynthetic pathway. The relatively high affinity of the S. pombe enzyme is indicated by a KD of 1.2 mM. Complete extraction of riboflavin from such preparations could only be achieved by denaturation of the protein with urea.21 In contrast, all other lumazine synthases studied so far were

isolated without bound riboflavin, indicating a significantly lower affinity. This unexpected property of the S. pombe enzyme prompted us to determine its three-dimensional structure which is reported here. In addition we have measured the affinity of lumazine synthases from B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae for riboflavin. Our results suggest that efficient stacking of the dimethylbenzene moiety of riboflavin with the highly conserved His94 is a major determinant of affinity. However, it is unclear at the moment whether this property is used as a feedback regulation mechanism of riboflavin biosynthesis in yeasts.

Results and Discussion
Quality of the models Lumazine synthase from S. pombe was crystallised either in complex with bound riboflavin (4) as isolated from recombinant E. coli (RIBO) or in complex with the substrate analogue 5-nitro-6-(D ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H )-pyrimidinedione (NRAP) (8) or the product analogue 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo8-ribityllumazine (CEOL) (9) (Figure 3). The mutant proteins W27G, W63Y and W63Y/L119F, which do not bind riboflavin, and the mutant L119F, which only weakly binds to riboflavin, were also analysed. Diffraction data were collected ° ° ° to resolutions of 2.4 A (RIBO), 2.4 A (NRAP), 2.6 A ° (W27G), 3.1 A (W63Y and L119F) ° (CEOL), 2.0 A ° and 2.7 A (W63Y/L119F), respectively. All crystals

belongs to space group C2221 with one pentamer in the asymmetric unit corresponding to the solution state of the protein. The crystal structure in complex with riboflavin was solved by Patterson search techniques using a pentameric facet from the icosahedral capsid of the B. subtilis lumazine synthase.12 The resulting refined model was used to analyse the other S. pombe lumazine synthase complexes and mutants. The structures were refined to crystallographic R values of 18.0% ðRfree ¼ 21:3%Þ (RIBO), 18.3% ðRfree ¼ 21:3%Þ (NRAP), 17.5% ðRfree ¼ 20:6%Þ (CEOL), 18.7% ðRfree ¼ 21:2%Þ (W27G), 19.4% ðRfree ¼ 23:2%Þ (W63Y), 19.4% ðRfree ¼ 23:1%Þ (L119F), 19.2% ðRfree ¼ 22:5%Þ (W63Y/L119F) with good stereochemistry (Table 1). More than 95% of all residues were found in the most favoured region of the

Ramachandran plot in all structures described here (Table 2). The monomers of S. pombe lumazine synthase (Figure 4) consist of 159 residues that were well defined in all structures with the exception of the first 11 residues. The latter were disordered to various extents in different subunits whereas the C-terminal residue Tyr159 was disordered in all subunits. Most of the side-chains were clearly defined by their electron density map, except for some located at the surface of the protein. The final model of the wild-type pentamer (Figure 5) is comprised of 742 amino acid residues in total. A

well-defined phosphate ion is found in all subunits in the putative binding site of the second substrate, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (2), in those complexes that were crystallised in the presence of high phosphate concentrations, i.e. all with the exception of RIBO. ° The temperature factors of riboflavin (61.7 A2) are higher than the average temperature factors of the ° protein (44.2 A2), whereas those of the inhibitors 8 and 9 are in the same range as the protein, reflecting the somewhat lower affinity of riboflavin to the protein (Table 1). However, all ligands were welldefined in the final electron density maps (Figure 6).

Structural overview and pentamer assembly All known crystal structures of lumazine synthases from different organisms exhibit a three-layered structure (a/b/a) which classifies them as ab proteins (Figure 4). The core of the monomer is reminiscent of the flavodoxin fold and consists of a central parallel b-sheet of four strands with topology b2b3b4b5 that is flanked on both sides by the a-helix motifs a1a4a5 and a2a3,

respectively. In accordance with the secondary structure and topology of the B. subtilis lumazine synthase,9 S. pombe lumazine synthase is described as b2a1b3 a2b4a3b5a4a5. The monomers of various lumazine synthases can be superimposed with ° r.m.s.d. values between 0.67 and 1.01 A between 142 a-carbon atoms; this reflects their structural similarity (Figure 7). Lumazine synthases occur either as pentamers or as icosahedral capsids that are best described as dodecamers of pentamers. The enzymes from B. subtilis9,12 (PDB entry 1RVV), E. coli14 and spinach15 (PDB entry 1C2Y) form icosahedral capsids of 60 identical b-subunits, whereas the lumazine synthases of S. pombe, S. cerevisiae16 (PDB 1EJB), M. grisea15 (PDB 1C41) and B. abortus17 (PDB 1DIO) only assemble to homopentamers. A main pentamer contact of the S. pombe lumazine synthase is provided by the inner helices a3 of the monomers that are arranged as a superhelical left-handed coiled coil along the 5-fold axis. The interior of the resulting central pore is mainly hydrophilic due to the presence of the residues Glu100, Asp112, Arg108 and His104 of ° each monomer. The smallest diameter is 6.3 A measured between the five inner histidine residues His104 which are found in multiple conformations. Salt bridges between Asp112 of one monomer and Arg108 of the neighbouring monomer stabilise the pentamer of S. pombe lumazine synthase. Superposition of the different lumazine synthases reveals some determinants that prevent the formation of icosahedral capsids from pentamers in some organisms. The most prominent differences are located in the loop connecting the helices a4 and a5 and in the N termini of the proteins (Figure 7). In all icosahedral structures of bacteria9,14 and plants15,22 this loop comprises the highly conserved motif G(T/G)K(A/H)GN which forms a pronounced kink and establishes multiple contacts to helix a1 and helix a4 of the adjacent pentamer. It seems likely that the insertion of four residues present in this loop of the S. cerevisiae lumazine synthase16 (GIDEA HSMHN) disrupts contacts to neighbouring subunits and therefore prevents capsid formation. We assume that the insertion of only one residue (Leu136) into this loop (GLNGGHN) is sufficient to prevent capsid formation of lumazine synthase from S. pombe. Note should be taken of the fact that an insertion of amino acids in the sequence of B. abortus does not form a clashing kink, but a continuous helix, which does not establish multiple contacts to adjacent pentamers.17 Therefore the enzyme from B. abortus is also unable to form a capsid. In the icosahedral lumazine synthase crystal structures9,11,15 the N terminus seems to play an important role in pentamer formation by interacting as the fifth strand b1 of the central b-sheet of the adjacent monomer. The 11 N terminal residues in the S. pombe lumazine synthase structure exhibit weak electron density but appear to adopt different conformations in various subunits

of the asymmetric pentamer. It can be ruled out that they were proteolytically removed since electrospray mass spectroscopy experiments demonstrated a homogeneous full-length protein.21 In the pentameric assembly of the S. cerevisiae enzyme,16 the N-terminal residues play a minor role, as up to 17 residues can be deleted with minor effect on stability of the pentamer assembly and enzymatic activity. N-terminal sequence alignments indicate that proline residues among the first ten residues prevent icosahedral assembly (Figure 8). In the described bacterial9,11 and plant15 structures no proline residues are present in this region, whereas in the pentameric structure of

S. pombe lumazine synthase two proline residues are found in positions 8 and 10. This conformational arrangement is able to obstruct the introduction of the missing b1-strand into the neighbouring monomer. However, the N-terminal residues 7 ­ 12 of one subunit of the wild-type enzyme point towards the turn between b4 and a3 of the neighbouring subunit. Therefore Pro8 is very close to the active site residue Trp27 of this subunit and occupies the opposite cleft of the substrate binding site. The presence of proline residues at positions 8 and 10 might be responsible for this conformational arrangement of the N-terminal strand.

Figure 7. Structural superposition of monomers of various lumazine synthases. Enzymes from S. pombe (yellow), B. abortus17 (dark blue), S. cerevisiae16 (light blue), and M. grisea15 (magenta) are pentameric, whereas lumazine synthases from B. subtilis9,11 (green), and spinach15 (orange) form icosahedral capsids. Increase of length of the loop connecting the helices a4 and a5 is in accordance with a different orientation of N termini for species forming a capsid (Nic) or a pentamer (Np) structure. Bound riboflavin and phosphate ion are shown to mark the substrate binding site and the putative binding site of S. pombe lumazine synthase.

Binding of riboflavin The five topologically equivalent active sites of the pentameric lumazine synthases are located at the interfaces between adjacent monomers of the pentamer (Figure 5). Here, two substrates have to be bound: 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate (2) and 5-amino-6-(D -ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H )pyrimidinedione (1) (see Figure 1). The binding site for the latter compound 1 is well-established by complexes of the B. subtilis,12 the spinach and the M. grisea lumazine synthases15 with the inhibitor 5-nitro-6-(D -ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H )-pyrimidinedione (8) (see Figure 3) and of the S. cerevisiae lumazine synthase with 5-(6-D -ribitylamino-2,4dihydroxypyrimidine-5-yl)-1-pentyl-phosphonic acid.16 The enzyme from S. pombe was the first described lumazine synthase that was found to bind riboflavin with relatively high affinity (KD of 1.2 mM).21 Riboflavin is the product of the following enzyme, riboflavin synthase, in the pathway. The position and conformational orientation of bound riboflavin is similar to already known complex structures with substrate analogues. Comparing lumazine synthase crystal structures of either the isolated or the inhibitor-bound proteins from B. subtilis,11 M. grisea, spinach,15 and S. cerevisiae16 with the crystal structure from S. pombe, clearly show that riboflavin would act as a competitive inhibitor that binds in the same manner as the inhibitors of the other enzymes. A

bound phosphate ion observed in the structure of B. subtilis lumazine synthase11 has been postulated to mark the phosphate binding site of the second substrate of the enzyme, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate. This was supported by the S. cerevisiae structure with 5-(6-D -ribitylamino-2,4dihydroxypyrimidine-5-yl)-1-pentyl-phosphonic acid.16 The phosphonate group of this compound is found in a similar position to the inorganic phosphate ion interacting with the guanidinium group of the highly conserved Arg136. In our structure of S. pombe lumazine synthase, an inorganic phosphate ion is found in a similar position, bound to the corresponding residue Arg133. As mentioned above, the active site is formed at the interface of two adjacent monomers. Monomer A contributes with residues between b2 and a1, the turn connecting b3 and a2 and the strand b4 and helix a3. Monomer B takes part with residues from strand b5, helix a4 and helix a5 (Figures 4 and 7). The isoalloxazine ring of the riboflavin molecule is bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by Trp27, Val86, Leu87, Ile88 and His94 (Figure 6). Polar groups of the riboflavin ring form several hydrogen bonds to main-chain and side-chain atoms of the protein. The carbonyl oxygen of Val86 interacts with the imido group N3 of the ring system. Further interactions are observed between the ring-carbonyl-oxygens atoms O2 and Ser62-N, O4 and Ile88-N and O2 and Ser62-Og. In all sequences of lumazine synthase either the aromatic residues tryptophan (like S. pombe ) or

Numbers refer to amino acid residues from S. pombe lumazine synthase.

phenylalanine (like B. subtilis ) are found in a position corresponding to Phe22 of the B. subtilis enzyme (Figure 8). This suggests the importance of an aromatic stacking interaction for substrate binding. Surprisingly, replacement of Trp27 by glycine substantially reduced the affinity of the S. pombe lumazine synthase for riboflavin but had only minor impact on the maximum catalytic rate of the enzyme.21 The isoalloxazine ring of riboflavin bound to S. pombe lumazine synthase is involved in two aromatic stacking interactions. The indole system of Trp27 is parallel to the ring system at a distance ° about 3.4 A. His94 is located at the opposite side ° of riboflavin about 3.2 A away building up the second stacking ring (Figure 6(a)). Thus riboflavin is bound by an aromatic "sandwich-packing" between these two aromatic heterocyclic ring systems. The active site residues equivalent to lumazine synthase from S. pombe Trp27 and His94 are present in the M. grisea (Trp25, His127) and in the S. cerevisiae (Trp26, His97) structure with bound substrate analogue, but the capability to bind riboflavin has not been investigated so far.16 The B. abortus sequence also contains this aromatic tryptophan residue (Trp20) but the histidine residue at position 88 is replaced by an arginine and the histidine involved in the binding is found at position 89. This creates a longer distance to a bound substrate or inhibitor molecule.17 Usually, a high degree of mobility of His88 is observed in the B. subtilis binding site.12 The ribityl side-chain of bound riboflavin is placed in a hydrophilic pocket of the neighbouring monomers. The ribityl hydroxyl groups OH3 and OH5 are in hydrogen bond distances to the highly conserved residue Glu64. The OH2 ribityl hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain

amide group of Trp63 of the adjacent monomer. OH5 is also hydrogen bonded to the main-chain amide group and OH4 to a carbonyl oxygen of Leu119 of the second monomer. Binding of a substrate analogue inhibitor The inhibitor molecule 5-nitro-6-(D -ribitylamino)2,4(1H,3H )-pyrimidinedione (8), which is a structural analogue of the natural substrate 1, competes with the riboflavin molecule for the same binding pocket (Figure 6(b)). The pyrimidine ring of 8 is bound in the same way in a hydrophobic region formed by Trp27, Val86, Leu87, Ile88 and the ribityl chain also points to the same hydrophilic environment (Trp63, Glu64, Leu119). The pyrimidine ring of 8 is in a stacking arrange° ment with Trp27 at a distance of 3.5 A. The peptide amide groups of Ser62 and Ile88 are directed towards the O2 and O4 carbonyl groups of the ligand pyrimidine. The main-chain oxygen atom of Val86 is strongly linked to the N3-amide atom of the pyrimidine inhibitor. The side-chain oxygen of Ser62 is involved in additional hydrophilic interaction to the O2 carbonyl. The ribityl hydroxyl groups OH2 and OH5 are hydrogen bonded to main-chain amide groups of Trp63 and Leu119 of the neighbouring monomer, while the well-ordered side-chain Glu64 is involved in two hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl groups OH3 and OH5. A different stereochemical conformation of the ribityl chain as found in arabityl or xylityl derivatives abolishes the optimal arrangement for the link to Glu64.12 A tightly bound inorganic phosphate ion in the 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone 4-phosphate binding site was found to be well-defined in the final electron density map. This phosphate is found at a

° distance of 6.2 A to 8 and is bound by main-chain hydrogen interactions of Ser91 and Thr92 and side-chain interaction of Arg133. Binding of a product analogue inhibitor In addition, we co-crystallised lumazine synthase from S. pombe with a derivative of the product 3, 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8-ribityllumazine (9). This tightly bound inhibitor molecule is also ° well defined in its electron density map at 2.6 A resolution and it is bound in the same manner as described for bound riboflavin or 8 before (Figure 6(c)). The lumazine ring of 9 is in a stacking inter° action with Trp27 at a distance of 3.4 A. The peptide amide groups of Ser62 and Ile88 are oriented towards the O2 and O4 carbonyl groups ° of the ligand's lumazine ring at 3.0 A distance. The main-chain oxygen atom of Val86 is strongly hydrogen bonded to the N3-amide atom of the ° oxo-lumazine inhibitor at a distance of 2.6 A. The side chain oxygen g-O of Ser62 is involved in an additional hydrophilic interaction to the O2 carbonyl group of the lumazine. The binding arrangements of the ribityl chain are exactly the

same as mentioned before for bound riboflavin or 8. In comparison with the binding of the substrate analogue inhibitor, where no interaction by the residue His94 is observed, hydrogen bonds to the carboxyethyl substituent at position 6 of the lumazine ring are added. Interactions by His94 are an important feature of binding riboflavin. Structural basis of riboflavin binding The wealth of structural information on lumazine synthases from various organisms makes a detailed comparison possible to get insight into the factors that modulate the affinity for riboflavin binding. The structures of the lumazine synthases from S. pombe and S. cerevisiae were found to be very similar. All residues that interact directly with riboflavin are identical and in the next shell of amino acids residues they differ only by two residues (Trp63 and Leu119 in case of the S. pombe enzyme). A superposition of the Ca-positions of Trp27, His94 and Leu119 of S. pombe lumazine synthase with the corresponding residues Trp26, His97 and Phe122 of the S. cerevisiae enzyme

° shows an r.m.s. deviation of only 0.23 A (Figure 9). The positions of the pyrimidinedione and ribityl moieties of the bound inhibitor 5-(6-D -ribitylamino-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine-5-yl)-1-pentylphosphonate and of riboflavin fit almost perfectly. Modelling the of riboflavin as bound to the S. pombe enzyme to the S. cerevisiae enzyme reveals a steric conflict between His97 and Ile101 ° (S. cerevisiae ) as the latter is shifted by about 1.0 A for Ca-atoms into the binding site of the xylene ring of riboflavin in the S. pombe enzyme (Figure 9). As both residues are well ordered and Ile101 is part of the rigid core of the protein a shift of His97/Ile101 upon riboflavin binding appears rather unlikely. Therefore, the dimethylbenzene moiety has to be accommodated in a slightly different orientation. The ambient residues of the active site of both enzymes differ only at positions 63 and 119 (S. pombe ) we assumed that their different side chain volumes account for the observed shift of Ile101 relative to Ile98 in S. pombe lumazine synthase. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the crystal structures of the mutants Trp63Tyr, Leu119Phe and the respective double mutant and measured their affinity for riboflavin. The structural analysis of these point mutants and comparisons with S. pombe and S. cerevisiae lumazine synthase show that the positions of the Ile98/ Ile101 cluster in a similar position for all proteins with the exception of the wild-type S. pombe protein. Its distinct orientation in turn influences the position of His94/His97 (Figure 10). The Cb-atoms of the cluster assume a position that corresponds to the Cg1-atom of S. pombe wild-type lumazine synthase. This corresponds to a displace° ment of 1.0 A between the Ca-atoms of S. pombe and S. cerevisiae lumazine synthase. The displacements between the Cb-atoms of S. pombe wild-type enzyme and S. cerevisiae lumazine synthase, W63Y, ° ° L119F are 1.3 A and for W63Y/L119F 1.6 A. The Trp63Tyr (KD of 5.0 mM) and the double mutant Trp63Tyr/Leu119Phe (KD of 4.4 mM) showed decreased affinities, with KD values very similar to the S. cerevisiae enzyme (KD of 3.9 mM) as expected. Correspondingly they did not bind riboflavin during purification and were isolated as colourless proteins. Interestingly, a slightly higher affinity was found for the Leu119Phe mutant (KD of 0.3 mM), which showed a faint yellow colour after purification. In that case the additional van der Waals contact between His94 and Phe119 ° (4.1 A minimum distance) may account for the slightly increased affinity. For comparison the affinity of the B. subtilis enzyme, a more distant member of the lumazine synthase family, was determined which yielded a KD of at least 1 mM. In that enzyme Ile98 is replaced by Val92 accompanied by a shift of the ° Ca-positions by 1.5 A towards the substrate bindg ing site. The C atom of Val92 is only in contact with one edge of the corresponding His88 and does not support its entire backside. This might

account for the flexibility of His88 of the B. subtilis enzyme usually observed and might be seen as a major reason for the largely reduced affinity to riboflavin. We conclude from our studies that the stacking interaction between riboflavin's xylene ring and His94 is required for efficient binding of riboflavin to lumazine synthase. The structural and functional analysis of wild-type and mutant enzymes revealed small and indirect effects with the most pronounced difference seen in the orientation of the neighbouring Ile98 or the presence of Phe119 that pack against His94. These appear to be sufficient to influence the essential stacking contact and thereby significantly modulate the affinity for riboflavin. At present, it is unknown whether the micro-molar affinity of some lumazine synthases for riboflavin, the ultimate product of the pathway, as observed here, plays a role as feedback regulatory mechanism in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Expression, purification and crystallisation The wild-type S. pombe lumazine synthase and the mutant protein W27G were cloned, expressed and purified as described by Fischer et al.21 Binding constants were determined by fluorescence titration or by equilibrium dialysis (B. subtilis ) as described.21 The cloning, expression and the purification of the mutant proteins W63Y, L119F and W63Y/L119F will be described elsewhere. After purification in the absence of riboflavin an average of 20% of the purified wild-type enzyme had bound the ligand.21 Therefore, for crystallisation the enzyme solution was saturated with solid riboflavin. Crystallisation was performed by the sitting drop vapour diffusion method by mixing equal amounts of wild-type enzyme (10 mg/ml) containing riboflavin in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 50 mM potassium chloride with reservoir solution containing 0.1 M citrate (pH 4.9­ 5.2) and 1.5 M sodium formate followed by equilibration against 0.3 ml of the reservoir buffer. Dark yellow crystals indicating the binding of riboflavin appeared within one to three days of maximal dimensions 0.4 mm £ 0.2 mm £ 0.2 mm. Crystals of the mutant enzymes W27G, W63Y, L119F and W63Y/L119F were grown from 0.1 M citrate (pH 5.0­ 5.6) containing 0.9­ 1.2 M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate. Co-crystallisation experiments with substrate analogue 5-nitro-6-(D -ribitylamino)-2,4(1H,3H )-pyrimidinedione and product analogue 6-carboxyethyl-7-oxo-8ribityllumazine inhibitors were carried out by mixing wild-type enzyme (10 mg/ml) containing riboflavin with solid inhibitors. Sitting drops were set up from 2 ml each of the inhibitor solutions containing tenfold molar excess of the corresponding inhibitor mixed with 2 ml of 0.1 M citrate (pH 5.0 ­5.5) and 0.3­ 0.7 M ammonium dihydrogen phosphate at room temperature. Data collection X-ray data for the riboflavin-bound wild-type enzyme, the three mutant enzymes W63Y, L119F, W63Y/L119F and for the two inhibitor complex structures were collected on a MARResearch 345 imaging plate detector

system mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode operated at 50 mA and 100 kV with l ¼ Cu Ka ¼ ° 1:542 A: The native data sets up to 2.4 A were integrated with MOSFLM.23 Crystals containing riboflavin belong to the space group C2221 with cell constants a ¼    111:50 A; b ¼ 145:52 A; c ¼ 128:70 A: The asymmetric unit contained one pentamer resulting in a Matthews ° coefficient of 3.04 A3/Da.24 Co-crystals of the inhibitor molecules belonged to the same orthorhombic space  group with cell dimensions of a ¼ 111:26 A; b ¼     145:04 A; c ¼ 127:86 A and a ¼ 111:09 A; b ¼ 145:18 A;  respectively. c ¼ 128:55 A; ° For the mutant enzyme W27G a data set to 2.0 A was measured at the DESY synchrotron source beamline BW6 (Hamburg, Germany) with l ¼ 1:05 A at room temperature employing a MARResearch CCD detector. This colourless crystal form belongs also to the space  group C2221 with the cell constants a ¼ 110:57 A; b ¼   144:02 A; c ¼ 126:36 A: Images from the MARResearch CCD detector were processed with the HKL package.25 All data sets were further processed using programs from the CCP4 suite.26 Data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. Structure solution The crystal structure of lumazine synthase from S. pombe was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP.26 A pentamer taken from the icosahedral structure of lumazine synthase from B. subtilis12 (PDB entry 1RVV) was used as a Patterson search model. The rotation function calculation was performed ° between 38 and 4.5 A. The highest peak was used for translational search, giving a top solution with a correlation coefficient of 37.9%. In the following translation search the highest peak gave the correct solution with correlation coefficient of 14.18 over 8.37 for the first false. The orientations and positions of the mutant pentamers and the two inhibitor enzyme complexes were determined using the finally refined structure of wild-type lumazine synthase from S. pombe excluding the co-ordinates for the riboflavin. Examination of the packing of the proteins within the crystal lattice indicated reasonable crystal contacts between the lumazine synthase pentamers without overlap of symmetryrelated molecules. Model building and refinement The initial model was subjected to rigid body and positional refinement using CNS.27 Model building was performed with the program MAIN.28 After several cycles of manual rebuilding, positional and B-factor refinement and two rounds of simulated annealing, water molecules were incorporated automatically into the various models. Restrained non-crystallographic ° symmetry of 40 kcal mol21 A22 was applied in all subsequent steps of refinement for each of the S. pombe lumazine synthase structures. In later stages of crystallographic refinement, the maximum-likelihood algorithm implemented in the program CNS was used. A geometry check using the program PROCHECK29 revealed that 96.0% and 4.0% for wild-type (RIBO) and 96.4% and 3.6% for the mutant protein W27G of all non-glycine residues lie within the most favoured and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.30 For the two inhibitor complex structures (CEOL and NRAP) and the additional mutant structures (W63Y, L119F and

W63Y/L119F) the geometry check leads to nearly the same good stereochemistry as for the ligand-free enzyme (see Table 2). Analysis and graphical representation Stereochemical parameters were assessed with PROCHECK.29 Protein structures were three-dimensional aligned with TOP3D26 and superpositions further refined with MAIN.28 Structural Figures. were prepared with MOLSCRIPT,31 BOBSCRIPT32 and RASTER3D.33
