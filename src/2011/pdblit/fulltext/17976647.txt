From RPA to BRCA2: lessons from single-stranded DNA binding by the OB-fold
Alexey Bochkarev√ and Elena Bochkareva
Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in our structural and biophysical understanding of how replication protein A (RPA), a major nuclear ssDNA-binding protein (SSB), binds DNA. The four ssDNA-binding domains of RPA have the characteristic OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding) fold and contact DNA with specific polarity via a hierarchy-driven dynamic pathway. A growing mass of data suggest that many aspects of the ssDNA binding mechanism are conserved among SSBs of different origin. However, this conservation is not restricted to the SSB class. The concepts of ssDNA binding by the OB-fold, first derived from the RPA structure, have been successfully applied to the functional characterization of the BRCA2 (breast cancer susceptibility gene 2) protein. The BRCA2 structure, in its turn, has helped to better understand RPA function.

able and the assistance of special factors, ssDNA-binding proteins (SSBs), is required [1≠4]. SSBs bind DNA with high affinity and little, if any, specificity. This binding plays several critical and conserved roles. First, SSB binding prevents DNA from interstrand and intrastrand re-annealing. Second, it protects solvent-exposed DNA bases from undesired chemical modification. Third, it mediates an ordered sequence of biochemical transformations in replication fork assembly, and contributes to decision making concerning whether base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair or recombination should be activated. The mechanism by which SSBs orchestrate these multiple functions remains unclear, but many new ideas are emerging from recent structural and functional studies. In the past few years, the structures of the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of several SSBs, with and without ssDNA, have been solved, including Escherichia coli SSB [5,6] and the major nuclear SSB of eukaryotic cells, known as replication protein A (RPA) [7≠10,11]. In this review, we will use RPA to illustrate structural differences and similarities among SSBs. We will also discuss how the RPA structures helped to functionally characterize other proteins, including the breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) protein [12].

The role of RPA
Human RPA was initially identified as a component of HeLa cell extracts that is absolutely necessary to support simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication. Subsequently, it was shown to be a redundant nuclear SSB necessary for such aspects of DNA metabolism as replication, recombination and repair. In humans, the three RPA subunits (RPA70, RPA32 and RPA14) are named according to their respective molecular weight [2≠4]. RPA does not possess any intrinsic enzymatic activity; it is a typical structural protein. In addition to DNA binding, the function of RPA is to orchestrate the specific interactions of nuclear proteins [13,14]. In this review, we will focus on advances in our structural understanding of RPA function in DNA binding.

Evolution of our understanding of the OB-fold
The OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding) fold comprises a five-stranded b sheet coiled to form a closed b barrel and capped by an a helix located between the third and fourth b strands. This folding motif was first characterized in 1992 in four proteins that bind either

Introduction
DNA in any living species (cells, viruses and plasmids) undergoes multiple conversions from single-stranded (ss) to double-stranded (ds) form. Under physiological conditions, the existence of ssDNA is energetically unfavorCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology 2004, 14:36≠42

oligonucleotides or oligosaccharides [15]. In the ten years since then, the OB-fold family has evolved into a widely represented structural class. The pending SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) database (release 1.65) contains about 100 different OB-fold proteins deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) by August 1st, 2003 ([16]; A Murzin, personal communication). During the past decade, the definition of the OB-fold has undergone several cycles of critical re-evaluation. First, it was accepted that the a helix capping one end of the barrel can be reduced to a single turn, an extended irregular loop [17] or a three-helix bundle (3HB) [11]. Second, the OB-fold loops can adopt different conformations; the barrel may be opened or closed [7,11]. Third, the OB-fold serves as a scaffold for more complicated structural entities. Different structural motifs, such as

zinc fingers, zinc ribbons and `towers', were found inserted into the loops between the first and second (L12) [11,12,18], and the second and third (L23) [19] b strands.

RPA structure
The RPA heterotrimer consists of six OB-folds and one winged helix-turn-helix (HtH) domain; these are arranged into the three subunits and are connected by flexible linkers (Figure 1a). There are four OB-folds in the RPA70 subunit, termed RPA70N (amino acids 1≠ 110), RPA70A (amino acids 181≠290), RPA70B (amino acids 300≠420) and RPA70C (amino acids 436≠616) [7,8,11]. In RPA32, the central OB-fold, RPA32D (amino acids 43≠170), is flanked at the N terminus by unstructured RPA32N (amino acids 1≠41), which carries all known phosphorylation sites in human RPA, and at the

C terminus by the HtH domain, RPA32C (amino acids 200≠270) [9,20]. The whole of RPA14 comprises a single OB-fold. The RPA70C OB-fold is distinct in that it contains two structural insertions not observed in the other RPA OB-folds; a zinc ribbon domain (in the tip of the L12 loop) and a 3HB (between the third and fourth b strands) (Figure 1d). RPA70B, RPA70C, RPA32D and RPA14 are flanked at the C terminus by an a helix. The subunit interface is mediated by three C-terminal helices (from RPA70C, RPA32D and RPA14) arranged in parallel. The structure of intact RPA is not yet known. Available electron microscopy and crystallography data suggested a hexamer of OB-folds centered on a multihelical bundle as a model for the apo RPA trimer (Figure 2a) [11,21].

Comparison of the structures of RPA70AB in the apo form and bound to octadeoxynucleotide revealed the binding mechanism (Figure 1c) [10]. The L12 and L45 loops are flexible in the absence of DNA, and the binding pocket is open. Upon DNA loading, the loops clamp down on it and stabilize the complex in the closed conformation. Not every OB-fold domain of RPA binds ssDNA. The ssDNA binding activity correlates with the presence of two conserved aromatics, prototypes of which, F238 and F269 (Figure 1b), stack with DNA bases in the RPA70AB≠ssDNA structure ([6,11,19,22,23,24]; see also Update). Characteristically, RPA70N and RPA14 lack these aromatics. RPA binds ssDNA using the four ssDNA-binding OB-fold domains: DBD-A, DBD-B, DBD-C and DBD-D, which correspond to structural domains RPA70A, RPA70B, RPA70C and RPA32D, respectively. Binding follows a hierarchical assembly pathway in which DBD-A through DBD-D bind from the 50 to the 30 ends of a given sequence [25,26]. RPA14 does not contribute to DNA binding and there is some controversy regarding RPA70N [27,28,29]. The RPA heterotrimer binds DNA in several stages, with occlusion lengths of 8≠10, then 13≠14 and finally 30

ssDNA binding mechanism
The first insight into how the OB-fold binds ssDNA was provided by the structure of RPA70AB (RPA70A and RPA70B in tandem), the major ssDNA-binding domain of RPA, bound to octadeoxynucleotide [7]. DNA binding is mediated by three major structural elements of each OB-fold: the L12 and L45 loops, and the C-terminal part of b-strand 3 (b3) (Figure 1b). L12 provides basic amino acids to hydrogen bond with the DNA phosphates, and b3 and L45 each provide one conserved aromatic sidechain (F238 and F269, respectively) to stack with DNA bases.

nucleotides (nt). A sequential binding model is currently accepted (Figure 2) [10]. Binding is initiated by DBD-A, the DBD with the highest affinity, followed by DBD-B [30,31]. Together, DBD-A and DBD-B comprise the major DBD (RPA70AB) and correspond to the wellcharacterized 8≠10 nt binding mode of the protein [32]. In the 13≠14 nt binding mode, RPA contacts DNA exclusively through the RPA70 subunit (DBD-A, DBD-B and DBD-C) [33]. The 30 nt mode is mediated by all four DBDs. As indicated by electron microscopy, RPA changes its conformation from globular to elongated upon DNA binding [34].

Hunting for new SBBs
Members of the OB-fold family do not generally exhibit detectible sequence identity [15]. Structural determinants for the OB-fold have been described [17]. Unfortunately, statistically reliable de novo prediction of the OBfold topology cannot be done at the moment. Weak sequence conservation among different DBDs helps to detect new members of this OB-fold subclass. The ssDNA-binding domains of RPA70 have been used to characterize several new SSBs in archaea. A homology search of the genome of the archaean Methanococcus jannaschii revealed four tandem repeats in ORF MJ1159 with significant sequence similarity to DBD-A [36]. Biochemical experiments confirmed ssDNA binding activity for the protein, which was called mjaSSB. This, in its turn, has been used to characterize yet another SSB in crenarchaea, Solfolobus solfataricus SSB [37].

Regulatory role of the OB-fold
Several recent structural findings demonstrate that the OB-fold can fulfill regulatory functions. The possibility of such regulation was first suggested by the structure of RPA70AB without DNA [10]. DBD-A and symmetryrelated DBD-B were packed in the crystals in such a way that DBD-B extends ssDNA-binding loop L12 into the DNA-binding cleft of DBD-A. Similar functionally important contacts have been reported to stabilize an interaction between two subunits in the telomeric SSB (Figure 3) [35]. The functional significance of this mechanism was outlined by demonstrating an overlap of the ssDNA- and XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum group A protein)-binding sites on DBD-A [29].
Figure 3

Understanding BRCA2 function
A prominent example of how the RPA structure helped to establish a function for another protein is the recent analysis of the BRCA2 protein [12]. BRCA2 is a 3418 amino acid nuclear protein, mutations in which are associated with breast cancer susceptibility. Extensive genetic and biological analysis has implicated BRCA2 as an important tissue-specific component of recombinationmediated dsDNA break (DSB) repair, but the precise nature of its contribution to maintaining chromosome structure could not be defined [38]. The most conserved part of BRCA2 is its approximately 800 amino acid C-terminal region, called BRCA2DBD (Figure 4a). The structure of BRCA2DBD (bound to DSS1 [deleted in split-hand/split-foot syndrome 1] protein) revealed five structural domains [12]. Four of them, the N-terminal multihelical domain (NTD) and three OB-folds (OB1, OB2 and OB3), are arranged in a linear fashion. The fifth, the tower domain, is inserted into the L12 loop of the second OB-fold and protrudes away from the core.

Several structural features underline the similarity between the RPA70AB≠ssDNA structure and the OB2≠ OB3 fragment of the BRCA2DBD structure. First, DBD-A is the closest structural homolog of OB2 (rmsd ∞ of 1.4 A for 82 [of 109] Ca atoms), as is DBD-B for OB3 ∞ (rmsd of 1.5 A for 84 Ca atoms). Second, the positions of the stacking aromatics in OB2 (W2909 and F2939) (Figure 4b) and OB3 (F3057) are conserved. Third, like DBD-A and DBD-B, OB2 and OB3 are arranged in tandem. Fourth, although OB3 is rotated by 658 (compared to DBD-B) along the axis running through the DNA-binding groove, the integrity of the DNA-binding groove is not affected. Based on the structural similarity, Yang et al. [12] solved the structure of BRCA2DBD in complex with oligo(dT)9. Qualitatively, the DNA binding mode of OB2≠OB3 is similar to that of RPA70AB. In the

absence of DNA, the L45 loop of OB2 is flexible and structural data are consistent with the interpretation that the L12 loop may also be flexible (Figure 4c). The conformation of the loops is stabilized (closed) in the presence of DNA. This structural similarity suggested a function for BRCA2. BRCA2 was revealed to be involved in RAD51-mediated homologous recombination as a stimulator that helps to displace RPA and facilitates ssDNA≠ RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation. This finding was further supported by the observation that the interaction between BRCA2 and RPA is compromised by a cancer-predisposing mutation in BRCA2 [39]. The authors also suggested two alternative explanations for how the NTD≠OB1 fragment of BRCA2 can bind ssDNA. First, OB1 may directly contact it. Second, part of DSS1, which is bound in the basic and highly aromatic groove in close proximity to the ssDNA-binding pocket of OB2, could dissociate as a result of competition with

ssDNA. The absence of conserved aromatics in OB1, a common feature of many DBDs, supports the second scenario. The OB2 domain may contribute to protein≠ protein interaction. Interestingly, two OB-folds of the large subunit of the Oxytricha nova telomere end binding SSB are involved in DNA binding and a third OB-fold mediates subunit interaction [31].

The tail of the tower
Not only has the RPA structure helped to understand BRCA2 function, but also the BRCA2 structure has helped to understand RPA function too. The possibility of direct interaction between the zinc ribbon (inserted in the L12 loop of DBD-C) and ssDNA, the interaction that may play a regulatory role, has been hypothesized [11]. The BRC2DBD≠ssDNA structure strongly supports this notion, in that OB2 (in BRCA2) also contains an insert, the tower, in the L12 loop (Figure 4). In BRCA2, the L12proximal part of the tower provides F2762 for stacking with DNA. The L12-distal part of the tower is a 3HB (not shown) that shares similarity with 3HB dsDNA-binding

Conclusions
Many SSB of different origin share common structural and functional features. This conservation is not reflected in sequence similarity. Nonetheless, these proteins may share a common OB-fold ancestor. Variety in the higher order structural assembly of the OB-fold proteins (E. coli SSB, mjaSSB, RPA, BRCA2) may reflect divergent evolutionary trajectories from shuffling the OB-folds.

Update
The recently reported structure of Pot1 (protection of telomeres 1) bound to ssDNA [41] supports the basic concepts of ssDNA binding by the OB-fold discussed in this review. This work also indicates that, depending on the sidechain composition, the OB-fold can bind ssDNA sequence specifically (Pot1) or sequence nonspecifically (RPA). Alternatively, RPA might have a hidden preference for some DNA sequences.
