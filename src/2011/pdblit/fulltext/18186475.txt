ABSTRACT Carbon≠carbon bond forming enzymes offer great potential for organic biosynthesis. Hence there is an ongoing effort to improve their biocatalytic properties, regarding availability, activity, stability, and substrate specificity and selectivity. Aldolases belong to the class of C¿ bond forming enzymes ¿C and play important roles in numerous cellular processes. In several hyperthermophilic Archaea the 2-keto-3-deoxy-(6phospho)-gluconate (KD(P)G) aldolase was identified as a key player in the metabolic pathway. The carbohydrate metabolism of the hyperthermophilic Crenarchaeote Thermoproteus tenax, for example, has been found to employ a combination of a variant of the Embden≠Meyerhof≠Parnas pathway and an unusual branched Entner≠Doudoroff pathway that harbors a nonphosphorylative and a semiphosphorylative branch. The KD(P)G aldolase catalyzes the reversible cleavage of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) forming pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or glyceraldehyde, respectively. In T. tenax initial studies revealed that the pathway is specific for glucose, whereas in the thermoacidophilic Crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus the pathway was shown to be promiscuous for glucose and galactose degradation. The KD(P)G aldolase of S. solfataricus lacks stereo control and displays additional activity with 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate (KDPGal) and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate (KDGal), similar to the KD(P)G aldolase of Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. To address the stereo control of the T. tenax enzyme the formation of the two C4 epimers KDG and KDGal was analyzed via gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the apoprotein ∞ was determined to a resolution of 2.0 A, and the crystal

structure of the protein covalently linked to a pathway inter∞ mediate, namely pyruvate, was determined to 2.2 A. Interestingly, although the pathway seems to be specific for glucose in T. tenax the enzyme apparently also lacks stereo control, suggesting that the enzyme is a trade-off between required catabolic flexibility needed for the conversion of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated substrates and required stereo control of cellular/physiological enzymatic reactions.

INTRODUCTION The stereospecific formation of carbon≠carbon bonds is one of the major interests in organic synthetic chemistry. Aldolases are part of the most important group of ¿C-bonding enzymes. They form a speasymmetric C¿ cific group of lyases that catalyze the reversible addition of a donor compound (nucleophile) onto an acceptor compound (electrophile) and they are generally categorized according to their nucleophilic donor compound in the corresponding aldolization reaction.1 Examples of nucleophiles are dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glycine, acetaldehyde, pyruvate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Furthermore, depending on the way their donor substrate is activated, they can be divided into two

classes. Class I aldolases do not need a cofactor, as their reaction mechanism of donor activation involves the formation of a Schiff base at a conserved lysine residue in the active site of the enzyme.2,3 Class I aldolases were reported in all three domains of life.4≠6 Class II aldolases in contrast are dependent on a metal ion (mainly Zn21, in some cases also Fe21 or Co21), which acts as a Lewis acid and activates the donor substrate. Class II aldolases are found in bacteria, funghi, and cyano bacteria. Up to now more than 30 aldolases are known, and they are common to most living organisms.3,7 In living cells, C¿ breaking and bonding is essential in both anabo¿C lism and catabolism of a wide variety of carbohydrates and of some keto acids. Archaeal KD(P)G aldolases show no significant sequence similarity to the classical ED aldolase (EDA),8 but are members of the diverse N-acetyl neuraminate lyase (NAL) superfamily.9 Besides being members of a new family, especially hyperthermophilic enzymes gained major interest due to their operational stability, for example, in combination with organic solvents, at high temperature and low pH. The crystal structures of the KD(P)G aldolase of S. solfataricus (in presence of the nonphosphorylated substrates KDG, KDGal, glyceraldehyde, pyruvate) and S. acidocaldarius (in presence of pyruvate) have recently been solved.10,11 The enzymes exhibit the classical (ba)8 TIM barrel fold and the catalysis proceeds, like for all members of this superfamily, via the Schiff base mechanism.9 The corresponding active site lysine has been identified in the crystal structures of S. solfataricus (Lys155) and S. acidocaldarius (Lys-153). The characterization of three KD(P)G aldolases from S. solfataricus, S. acidocaldarius, and S. tokodaii revealed a great flexibility towards the aldehyde acceptor (e.g., glyceraldehyde, GAP, glycolaldehyde, glyoxylate, erythrose, threose),11 therefore being an interesting tool for carbon≠carbon bond formation in biotechnological applications (fine chemicals, chemopharmaceuticals). However, the enzymes lack stereo control, which thus restricts their use in this regard. Comparative studies of carbohydrate metabolism in hyperthermophilic Archaea indicate that sugars are generally metabolized by variants of the Entner≠Doudoroff (ED) and Embden≠Meyerhof≠Parnas (EMP) pathways.12 More recent studies in T. tenax and S. solfataricus revealed that both organisms rather utilize a branched ED pathway with a nonphoshorylative and semiphosphorylative branch.13,14 Both pathways differ in their respective phosphorylation steps which take place at the level of glycerate (nonphoshorylative ED, glycerate kinase) or 2-keto3-deoxygluconate (semiphoshorylative ED, KDG kinase), respectively. The KD(P)G aldolase is a key player in both ED branches. The enzymes of T. tenax and S. solfataricus were shown to be bifunctional, catalyzing the cleavage of KDPG in the semiphoshorylative ED branch forming glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate as well as the cleavage of KDG in the nonphoshorylative ED branch forming

glyceraldehyde and pyruvate. Strikingly, the branched ED pathway was shown to be promiscuous for glucose and galactose (C4 epimers) degradation in S. solfataricus: glucose dehydrogenase was shown to be active on both sugars, gluconate dehydratase on gluconate and galactonate, KDG kinase as well as KD(P)G aldolase on KDG and 2keto-3-deoxygalactose (KDGal) and the latter also on KDPG and KDPGal.14≠16 In contrast, in T. tenax glucose dehydrogenase as well as gluconate dehydratase were shown to be specific for glucose and gluconate, respectively13 and no growth of T. tenax has been observed with galactose as carbon source.17 Further on, whereas T. tenax was shown to use both pathways, EMP and branched ED pathway, for glucose degradation in parallel (in vivo NMR studies18), S. solfataricus relies on the branched ED pathway for glucose or galactose degradation. The presence of the branched ED pathway, which seems to be specific for glucose in T. tenax suggested the presence of a stereo specific KD(P)G aldolase in this organism. In order to address this question biochemical studies were performed and the crystal structure of the KD(P)G aldolase was determined at a resolution of ∞ 2.0 A. In addition, we have unraveled the structure of the enzyme bound to a reaction intermediate, namely pyruvate. These structures allow us to further investigate the functionality of this class of enzymes. MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein preparation Enzyme assays

The gad and kdgA genes of T. tenax and the kdgA gene of S. solfataricus were cloned, expressed in E. coli using the pET expression system and enriched by heat precipitation as described previously.13 The KD(P)G aldolase from T. tenax has a molecular weight of 33 kDa per monomer. The gluconate dehydratase assay was performed in the presence of 10 mM D-gluconate and 800 lg gluconate dehydratase of T. tenax and the KD(P)G aldolase assay in the presence of 10 mM pyruvate, 5 mM glyceraldehyde and 250 lg KD(P)G aldolase of T. tenax and S. solfataricus, respectively (total volume 1 ml). To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, enzymes were dialyzed against water, all substrates were prepared in water and the enzyme reaction was performed in water. Samples were incubated at 708C for 30 and 60 min, respectively. Controls were incubated in the absence of protein. Samples were withdrawn after the incubation time and completely dried under vacuum.
Product analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy

To perform the gas chromatography, a derivatization (to enhance the volatility of the substances) was carried out as follows. The dried samples were resolved in 20 ll

pyridine (Fluka-Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) containing 20 mg/ml methoxyamine (Fluka-SigmaAldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) and incubated for 90 min at 308C under agitation. Subsequently, 32 ll Nmethyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA, CS Chromatography Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) were added, followed by an incubation for 30 min at 378C and 2 h at 258C. 4 ll of a mixture of eight different alkans (C10, C12, C15, C19, C22, C28, C32, C36, each 0.2% (w/v)) in cyclohexane were added for the calibration of retention indices according to van den Dool and Kratz.19 2 ll of the derivatized samples were injected in a Finnigan Trace gas chromatograph (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, USA) equipped with a DB-5MS column (J&W Scientific, Folsom, USA). Eluted compounds were analyzed with a trace mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, USA) after electron impact ionization. All parameters for sample injection, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry are described elsewhere.20 The chemical formula of the diastereomers KDG/KDGal after derivatization is included in Figure 3.
Crystallization

The protein was crystallized at room temperature using the vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 ll of 5≠10 mg/ ml protein in a solution of 50 mM HEPES/KOH pH 7 in addition to 5 mM DTT as antioxidant, 1 ll of reservoir solution of 1.5≠1.7M ammonium sulphate and 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 8. Within 1 to 2 weeks hexagonal crystals appeared with approximate dimensions of 0.3 3 0.3 3 0.1 mm3. Additionally, the aldolase was cocrystallized with pyruvate by adding 1 ll of 100 mM pyruvate to the crystallization droplet.
Data collection and structure determination

The structure was completed by iterative cycles of refinement and model building with Refmac5 and Coot.26,27 The final model is complete in all monomers except some terminal residues. Furthermore, 2Fo≠Fc- and Fo≠Fcmaps clearly indicated an alanine instead of a valine at position 58 of the sequence for all crystal structures. This unintended point mutation was presumably due to an early error in the polymerase chain reaction of the original cloning of the gene. However, the residue is located in the hydrophobic core of the protein and can thus be considered conservative. Ramachandran plots using Procheck28 show that for all structures over 90% of the nonglycine residues are in the most favourable region. Only 0.6% or less of the residues are present in disfavored regions, with the fractions being 92.5, 0.5% for the apoprotein, and 91.3, 0.6% for the pyruvatecomplex (see also Table I). However, the residues found in the disfavoured regions are mainly located at the boundary to the solvent. The pairs of Tyr120/ Tyr121, also indicated as outliers, are situated in the intrasubunit regions A≠D and B≠C, opposite their counterparts from the other chain. The final R and Rfree factors30 are 0.19 and 0.22, respectively, for both data sets. Further data collection and refinement statistics are reported in Table I. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been submitted to the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 2R91 and 2R94).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy

The diffraction data of the protein crystals were recorded at beamline X10SA of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) using a mar225 CCD detector.21 Diffraction data of the apoprotein as well as of enzyme plus pyruvate were collected. All crystals were cryoprotected using a 50% glycerol-in-water solution plus reservoir solution and subsequently flash-frozen in the cryo stream. The data collections were performed at 100 K. All data were integrated and scaled using XDS,22 the phases were determined by molecular replacement with Phaser,23 using KD(P)G aldolase from S. solfataricus (PDB entry 1W3N.pdb10) as search model (45.8% sequence identity). The structure-based sequence alignment between the enzymes from T. tenax and S. solfataricus (using the DALI server24) is given in Figure 1. A solvent content estimation25 of roughly 69% (Matthews ∞ coefficient of 3.9 A3/Da) indicated four molecules, that is, one tetramer, in the asymmetric unit.

The substrate promiscuity of the T. tenax KD(P)G aldolase was analyzed by gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC/MS). Similar to the S. solfataricus KD(P)G aldolase, incubation of the T. tenax enzyme in the presence of pyruvate and glyceraldehyde revealed two distinct peaks in the gas chromatogram [Fig. 2(a)] suggesting KDG as well as KDGal formation for both enzymes. To differentiate between both products, the specific formation of KDG from gluconate via gluconate dehydratase was used [Fig. 2(b)]. The gas chromatogram revealed a single peak at 27.14 min, identifying the second peak of the KD(P)G aldolase reaction, which is also shown, as KDG. Furthermore, the extracted mass spectra of the specific KDG peak (Peak 1) as well as the KDGal peak (Peak 2) formed by KD(P)G aldolase were identical, compare Figure 3. These data clearly indicate that the T. tenax KD(P)G aldolase, like the S. solfataricus enzyme, lacks stereo control, at least for the anabolic direction. Thus, although the pathway seems to be specific for glucose in T. tenax and the organism is not able to utilize galactose as carbon source, the enzyme is promiscuous forming KDG as well as KDGal from glyceraldehyde and pyruvate.

The differences in retention times of the same compounds are due to the fact that the experiments were performed at different times. The necessary cleaning and maintenance of the columns lead to slightly different behavior. A correction of such shifts is frequently done by the calculation of the retention index. The retention indices in (a) are 1845.6 (peak 1) and 1848.8 (peak 2), respectively, and in (b) 1844.5 for peak 1 and 1847.0 for peak 2.

might be essential for the bifunctional role in the branched ED pathway, which requires metabolic flexibility and activity with phosphorylated and non-phoshorylated substrates (KDG and KDPG in the physiological, catabolic direction).
Overall structure

The crystal structure of KD(P)G aldolase from T. tenax ∞ has been determined to a resolution of 2.0 A. The protein crystallizes with one tetramer per asymmetric unit. The

model of the KD(P)G aldolase apoprotein contains 1144 residues in the asymmetric unit, and 690 water molecules were placed in the refinement procedure, that of the pyruvate complex contained 1135 residues and 315 water molecules in the main chains. The monomeric structure of the KD(P)G aldolase is a classical (ba)8 TIM barrel with an additional N-terminal helix. All four crystallographically independent monomers are very similar. The structure forms a torus-like structure similar to that found in S. solfataricus10 and S. acidocaldarius.11 The tetramer structure is shown in Figure 4. The monomeric subunits

The Ca chains from T. tenax and from S. acidocaldarius ∞ superpose with an rms deviation of 1.10 and 0.98 A for 280 and 281 aligned residues (chain A, PDB entries 2NUW.pdb and 2NUX.pdb), respectively. With pyruvate as bound ligand, the superposition of 278 residues (chain A) of the Ca chains from T. tenax and from S. acidocaldarius (PDB entry 2NUY.pdb) yields an rms deviation of ∞ 1.14 A. This close structural similarity is expected given the high level of sequence identity.

The KDPG aldolase tetramer, shown in ribbon representation with a different color for each of the monomers. The accessible surface areas between the A and ∞ D chains and the B and C chains are 1745 and 1773A2, respectively, and the accessible surface areas between the A and C chains and the B and D chains are ∞ 1010 and 962 A2, respectively. The interface areas have been calculated via the protein≠protein interaction server.31

of the T. tenax KD(P)G aldolase are closely connected via polar and nonpolar interactions. The maximum interface accessible surface areas are found between the B and C chains and between the A and D chains, 1773 and 1745 ∞ A2, respectively. The accessible surface areas between the A and C chains and the B and D chains are 1010 and 962 ∞ A2, respectively. These values suggest that the structure can be described as a dimer of dimers and support the notion that the tetramer is the natural and most thermostable state of the protein. Generally, oligomeric structures were suggested to contribute to the high thermostability of the enzymes.32≠35 All monomers are identical in sequence. However, in the apoprotein, all chains have well-defined density up to residue 306, whereas in the density maps of the protein cocrystallized with pyruvate this is only the case for chain A, and the terminal residues beyond 304 are not visible in the density maps of chains B and C, and in chain D those beyond 301. The remaining residues are disordered in the solvent. As expected, both investigated KD(P)G aldolase structures (apoprotein, and protein cocrystallized with pyruvate) are very similar. The rms deviations of the corre∞ sponding Ca chains of the tetramers are 0.33 A. Hence there are no overall conformational changes upon binding.

The active site is located near the centre of the TIM barrel, close to the C-terminus. It is freely accessible to solvent which is indicated by the fact that sulfate ions from the crystallization solution are found in the substrate binding pockets of the apoprotein structure (data not shown). The SO422 ion forms hydrogen bonds with the residues Thr61, Thr62, and Tyr148, as well as a salt bridge with the active site lysine (Lys173) which takes part in the enzymatic Schiff-base formation. Its position is clearly not a possible phosphate binding site for the KD(P)G. Rather it fills the position occupied by the carboxy moiety in the full Schiff-base complex, as is seen in the structure of the aldolase-pyruvate reaction intermediate.

Figure 6 shows the (unbiased) Fo≠Fc difference density map with the final model of the active region of the aldolase≠pyruvate complex superimposed. (``unbiased'' here means that the density was calculated prior to introducing the ligand in the refinement.) The continuous density extending from the Lys173 residue could be unambiguously identified as the pyruvate molecule covalently bound to the Ne-atom and thus as a Schiff-base reaction intermediate. The carboxylate group of the pyruvate is tightly bound to the protein via hydrogen bonds to the amide groups of the neighbouring residues Thr61 and Thr62 as well as to the hydroxyl group of the latter. These two threonines are part of a GTTG motif that appears well

conserved due to its role in substrate binding. Additionally, Tyr148 is within hydrogen bond distance of the carboxylate group of the substrate. The local changes in the active site region upon binding of the pyruvate are minimal suggesting that the apoenzyme is already in the substrate binding conformation and does not rely upon an induced fit mechanism for tight substrate binding. Figure 7 shows a least-square superposition of the corresponding Ca-chains of the active sites of S. solfataricus and T. tenax KD(P)G aldolases. The covalently bound reaction intermediate can be clearly identified in both structures which are seen to superpose very well. The lack of stereoselectivity was investigated in a series of structures

determined for the S. solfataricus KD(P)G aldolase and shown related to the capacity of the active site to hydrogen bond both KDG and KDGal.10 As all residues involved in the hydrogen bonding network with the substrate in the S. solfataricus KD(P)G aldolase are structurally conserved in the T. tenax structures presented here (see Fig. 1), it seems therefore likely that the two enzymes employ a similar mechanism to achieve substrate promiscuity. The catalytic mechanism of aldolases that belong to the NAL (N-acetylneuramiate lyase) superfamily relies on Schiff-base formation with the substrate followed by oxidation of the C4hydroxyl group leading to the carbon≠carbon bond cleavage. It has previously been suggested that the reaction mechanism is substrate-assisted with the carboxylate group of the substrate participating in proton transfer.36 The crystallographic investigation of the S. solfataricus KD(P)G aldolase corroborates the notion of substrateaided catalysis and furthermore points to a tyrosine (Tyr130 in the S. solfataricus protein) as a likely shuttle for a proton between the C4 hydroxyl and the carboxylate.10 Our structure of the T. tenax enzyme shows that the corre∞ sponding tyrosin (Tyr148) is located 2.9 A from the carboxylate group of the substrate, which is in agreement with its proposed role as a proton shuttle. An intriguing property of the KD(P)G aldolase from T. tenax is the ability to cleave KDG as well as the phosphorylated KDPG. It is thus expected that the active site contains binding pockets for both substrates. To this end a KDPG substrate has been modelled into the active site of the aldolase based on the known binding site of the pyruvate part of this molecule (Fig. 8). In this model it is seen that two arginine residues (Arg255 and Arg124) and a tyrosine (Tyr150) form what appears to be a perfect binding pocket for a phosphate. It is noticable that Arg124 belongs to a neighbouring monomer emphasizing the relevance of

the particular tetrameric structure for proper substrate binding. The model provides a molecular rationale for the bifunctionality of the enzyme and furthermore agrees well with a recently modelled phosphate binding site of S. acidocaldarius KD(P)G aldolase.11

CONCLUSIONS Archaeal hyperthermophilic aldolases have raised major interest in organic chemistry due to their great intrinsic stability. Here we have assessed the stereoselectivity, catalysis and bifunctionality of KD(P)G aldolase from Thermoproteus tenax. Surprisingly, considering the metabolic background, like the enzymes of S. solfataricus and S. acidocaldarius, the T. tenax enzyme lacks stereoselectivity. The crystal structure has been determined to a resolution of ∞ 2.0 A in its apo form and together with its substrate pyruvate. At the active site lysine the formation of a Schiff base as reaction intermediate could be clearly identified. Enzyme as well as pathway promiscuity has been predicted to play a critical role in the evolution of new enzyme activities.15,37 The active site of the KDPG aldolase presented here provides enough space for a phosphorylated KDPG substrate. Our findings thus corroborate the possibility that also in the case of KDPG aldolase from T. tenax all four compounds (KDG and KDPG as well as s KDGal and KDPGal) are substrates of the enzyme. However, since T. tenax is not able to grow with galactose as carbon source17 and initial enzymes of the branched ED pathway (glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate dehydratase13) exhibit stereo control, the role of KD(P)G aldolase promiscuity in T. tenax is still unclear. It might represent an evolutionary relict or the consequence of its bifunctional physiological role in the

unusual branched ED pathway. It is tempting to speculate that the lack of stereo control is a trade-off between the required bifunctional activity (phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated substrates) and required stereo control of cellular/physiological enzymatic reactions.
