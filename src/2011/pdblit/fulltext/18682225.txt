Ribonuclease P: a ribonucleoprotein enzyme Jeffrey C Kurz and Carol A Fierke*
The ribonucleoprotein ribonuclease P catalyzes the hydrolysis of a specific phosphodiester bond in precursor tRNA to form the mature 5 end of tRNA. Recent studies have shed light on the structures of RNase-P-RNA-P-protein and RNase-PRNA-precursor-tRNA complexes, as well as on the positions of catalytic metal ions, emphasizing the importance of the structure to the catalytic function.

a specific phosphodiester bond in vivo and can be modified to catalyze multiple turnovers in vitro. Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is a ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes the 5┤ maturation of precursor tRNA (pretRNA; Figure 1), an essential step in the formation of functional tRNA molecules in all three domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya; reviewed in [3-6]). In bacteria, this enzyme is composed of two subunits, an RNA (350-400 nucleotides) and a protein (about 120 amino acids) moiety. The RNA component catalyzes the cleavage reaction in vitro in the presence of high concentrations of salt [7], demonstrating that the RNA contains the essential determinants for binding and cleaving pre-tRNA. However, the protein component facilitates cleavage by RNase P under physiological salt concentrations [7-9] and is required for efficient tRNA processing in vivo [10]. Besides the ribosome, RNase P is the only RNA catalyst that behaves as a true enzyme in vivo because it catalyzes multiple turnovers and is unchanged during catalysis. Thus, RNase P is an ideal enzyme to compare structure-function relationships and catalytic mechanisms in protein and RNA enzymes. This review focuses on work published in the past two years.

Introduction
Structure/function studies of RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, are providing fresh insights into the principles governing biological catalysis. Although this is a relatively new field in comparison with traditional protein enzymology, the structural and mechanistic data for an expanding list of RNA molecules, including the hammerhead, hepatitis delta virus, hairpin, group I and group II intron ribozymes, are rapidly accumulating [1,2]. Each of these ribozymes catalyzes self-cleavage at

Substrate recognition by RNase P
Because a single RNase P enzyme catalyzes the maturation of all tRNA precursors in an organism, substrate recognition is probably based on conserved structural features, rather than primary sequence. In fact, numerous data have demonstrated that RNase P recognizes the coaxially stacked acceptor stem and T-stem-loop of tRNA, as

Large stars (5) indicate nucleotides in B. subtilis RNase P RNA cross-linked by positions in the 5 leader of pre-tRNA [27]. Diamonds (x) indicate positions in E. coli RNase P RNA that form cross-links to tRNA [28].

White arrows identify positions of importance for catalysis, as determined by phosphorothioate interference in B. subtilis holoenzyme (SM Crary, CA Fierke, unpublished data) and E. coli RNase P RNA [55ии]. Black arrows indicate adenosine residues that are important for catalysis by E. coli RNase P RNA, as determined by NAIM using N7-deaza-adenosine [56].

well as the conserved 3-CCA nucleotides (Figure 1; [11Г14]). However, the structural details of the pre-tRNA binding pocket in RNase P RNA are limited because of the lack of high-resolution structural data. Much of what is known about the structure of RNase P RNA is based on phylogenetic comparative analysis of RNase P RNA sequences [15]. The primary and secondary structures of bacterial RNase P RNAs show a great deal of variability. Nonetheless, the secondary structures of bacterial RNase P can be divided into two ancestral types, typified by Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli RNase P RNA (Figure 2), with a common core of primary and secondary structure [16,17]. Biochemical evidence, using truncated RNase P RNA constructs, suggests that the

RNase P ribozyme is composed of two domains [18,19]: a specificity domain that contacts the T-stem-loop of the pre-tRNA substrate [20,21]; and a catalytic domain that contains the majority of conserved nucleotides in RNase P RNA. In the presence of the protein component, the catalytic domain retains significant pre-tRNA processing activity [22], indicating that the active site of the native ribozyme is located in this region. To provide the many constraints necessary for accurate three-dimensional modeling of the RNase-P-RNA-pretRNA complex, chemical crosslinking is the current method of choice. Thionucleotides, such as 4-thiouridine (s4U) and 6-thioguanosine (s6G), may be incorporated into RNAs by chemical synthesis of oligoribonucleotides [23]

or by standard in vitro transcription techniques using T7 RNA polymerase [24,25]. Exposure to ultraviolet light activates the thionucleotide to form covalent adducts with other RNAs (or proteins) in the immediate vicinity (within 2-3 ┼), and the locations of the crosslinks may be determined by sequencing of the RNA using reverse transcriptase ([24,25]; Figure 2). Christian et al. [26] incorporated s6G into the +1 position of mature tRNAAsp and the -1 position of pre-tRNAAsp (Figure 1) and demonstrated that these nucleotides are adjacent to A248 (in J18/2, the single-stranded region joining helices P18 and P2) and G332/G333 (J5/15), respectively, in E. coli RNase P RNA. A subsequent study with s4U incorporated into the leader sequence of pre-tRNA demonstrated possible contacts from leader nucleotides to nucleotides within the J5/15, J18/2, L15 and P3 regions of the ribozyme [27]. The complementary approach, incorporating s4U into E. coli RNase P RNA, identified potential contacts between the 5-leader and 3-trailer sequences of a pre-tRNATyr substrate and nucleotides U257 (J15/16 of E. coli RNase P), U294 (J15/16) and U69 (P4) [28]. Thus, the crosslinking data support the kinetic and phylogenetic data that designate J5/15, J18/2, helix P4 and surrounding regions as the `catalytic domain' and suggest that these regions in the RNase P RNA secondary structure must fold together in the active ribozyme. A complementary approach to crosslinking is the incorporation of non-native nucleotides in the RNA in a technique known as nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM; reviewed in [29]), to identify positions where addition or deletion of a specific functional group decreases the affinity of RNase P for tRNA (Figure 2). 2-Aminopurine and 2,6-aminopurine, for example, are analogs that have been used to identify functionally important adenosine (6-aminopurine) residues [30ии]. Coincorporation with the chemically labile phosphorothioate (which is sensitive to iodine-catalyzed hydrolysis) marks the position of the analog for mapping by comparison with a reverse transcriptase RNA sequencing ladder [31]. Analog substitutions of adenosine [30ии] and guanosine [32ии] residues at several positions in E. coli RNase P RNA interfere with substrate binding. The majority of interferences occur in single-stranded joining or loop regions in the RNase P RNA secondary structure, and several of these positions are highly conserved, corroborating their functional importance. However, crosslinking and other, additional data are required to distinguish effects caused by intermolecular contacts from tertiary structural perturbations in the RNase P RNA. Current three-dimensional models of the RNase-PRNA--tRNA complex [33,34] are derived from phylogenetic comparisons, mutagenesis data and chemical crosslinking data, but do not incorporate constraints from recent thionucleotide crosslinking or NAIM studies. Prior crosslinking studies used RNAs modified with photo-reactive azidophenacyl [33,35Г37] or azidobenzoate [38]

Potential catalytic transition state, depicting several proposed roles for divalent metal ions. The data indicate that two to three magnesium ions are required for pre-tRNA binding and catalysis [41,42,50,51и,75]. Metal rescue of pre-tRNA substrates containing an RP-phosphorothioate substitution at the cleavage site provides evidence for MeC2+ [49,50,51и]. Whether metal ions fulfil any of the other proposed roles in RNase P is not yet clear.

groups to constrain positions within RNase P RNA or the interaction with tRNA to within 5-10 ┼. Refinement of these models with the short-range constraints available from the techniques just described will improve our understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the RNase P-RNA-pre-tRNA complex.

Catalytic mechanism of RNase P
RNase P catalyzes the cleavage of P-3O bonds to produce 5-phosphate and 3-hydroxyl end groups at a specific site on pre-tRNA (Figure 1). The most plausible catalytic mechanism is an SN2 in-line attack of a solvent nucleophile on the phosphate diester with a trigonal bipyramidal transition state (Figure 3; reviews [39,40]). The rate constant of the cleavage step increases with pH [41], consistent with either a hydroxide or metal-hydroxide nucleophile or a general base-catalyzed hydrolysis mechanism. Catalysis by RNase P is absolutely dependent on divalent cations such as Mg2+ or Mn2+ [41,42]. Known catalytic roles for divalent cations are summarized in Figure 3 and in other reviews [2,43-45]. Potential interactions of metal ions with the pre-tRNA substrate have been probed by substitution of phosphate oxygen atoms with sulfur, which, among other effects, significantly decreases the affinity of directly coordinated magnesium ions [46,47], leading to a diminution in the catalytic activity. Additionally, the activity of the phosphorothioate-substituted RNA could be rescued upon addition of a metal ion that has higher affinity for sulfur coordination, such as the more polarizable manganese or

cadmium ions (although direct coordination is not necessarily required; see [48ии]). For RNase P, substitution of a sulfur atom for either the RP or SP nonbridging phosphate oxygen [49,50,51и] (MeC2+ in Figure 3) or the 3 oxyanion leaving group [52ии] (MeD2+ in Figure 3) in pre-tRNA decreases the catalytic rate constant by >1000-fold. Furthermore, the cleavage rate of the RP-phosphorothioate substrate is rescued by the addition of either manganese or cadmium, perhaps suggesting direct metal coordination to this nonbridging oxygen during catalysis. No rescue is observed for the SP-phosphorothioate or 3-S-phosphorothiolate, however, perhaps due to steric exclusion of catalytic metal ions or metal ion coordination of multiple oxygen atoms [53]. From these data, a detailed model of the RNase P RNA cleavage reaction has been proposed (Figure 3), similar to the SN2 in-line displacement mechanism proposed based on the crystal structures of protein metalloenzyme phosphoryl transferases [40]. The positions of functional metal sites in RNase P RNA are currently not known. Modification interference experiments using random phosphorothioate modifications have successfully demonstrated the importance for catalysis or substrate docking of four, out of greater than 400, pro-RP oxygens in E. coli RNase P RNA and these oxygens are located in helix P4 [54]. Recent studies of the activity of RNase P with specific phosphorothioate modifications have demonstrated that substitution at the nonbridging phosphate oxygens 5 of A49 or G50 in B. subtilis RNase P RNA (SM Crary and CA Fierke, unpublished data) and A67, G68 or A352 in E. coli RNase P RNA ([55ии]; Figure 2) decreases catalysis >500-fold and suggests that these groups may coordinate magnesium ions. Consistent with this, the activity of E. coli RNase P RNA containing an SP-phosphorothioate linkage at A67 is completely rescued by the addition of manganese. The locations of these sites correspond to positions of catalytically important adenosine residues identified by NAIM [56] (Figure 2), which is consistent with a role for P4 in the architecture of the active site. Additional biophysical and kinetic data provide evidence for a metal-binding site in the P15-loop of E. coli [57Г59].

consistent with studies indicating that the protein alters substrate specificity [62,63]. A recent X-ray crystal structure of the B. subtilis RNase P protein [64] makes it possible to interpret the function of the protein in structural terms. This structure, and the more recent NMR structure of the Staphylococcus aureus protein [65], reveals three possible RNA-binding motifs, including a putative single-stranded RNA-binding cleft formed by an -helix and a four-stranded -sheet. On the basis of this information, specific residues in the cleft were mutated to cysteine and the thiol moieties modified with the azidophenacyl crosslinking reagent. In the RNase P holoenzyme-pre-tRNA complex, crosslinks are formed to positions Г4 to Г8 in the 5-leader, suggesting a direct contact of the protein with the substrate [66]. Importantly, this unique mode of interaction suggests that catalysis in this ribonucleoprotein complex might occur at the interface of RNA and protein. The sequences of the bacterial RNase P proteins are variable, with modest sequence identity [67и,68]; nonetheless, the E. coli and B. subtilis proteins can substitute for one another [7,69], suggesting that structural features of the protein-binding site are highly conserved. Several regions of P protein, including the conserved `RNR' motif [Lys-Xaa4Г5-Ala-Xaa2-Arg-Asn-Xaa2-(Lys or Arg)-Arg-Xaa2(Arg or Lys)], contact P RNA, as indicated by mutagenesis and crosslinking experiments [64,68,70]. The protein protects several regions from nuclease digestion or chemical modification in both E. coli [71,72] and B. subtilis [73] RNase P RNAs (Figure 2). These protected areas are more extensive than might be predicted for direct interaction with a protein of this size, suggesting that structural changes in the RNA component also occur upon protein binding. Biswas et al. [74ии] prepared single-cysteine mutants of the E. coli protein and modified the sulfhydryl with EDTA-2-aminoethyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, a reagent that effectively converts the modified protein into a chemical nuclease. Analogous to crosslinking, this approach detects specific cleavages of RNase P RNA in P3, P4, J2/4 and J18/2, that occur in holoenzyme complexes reconstituted with the modified proteins (Figure 2). These data place the protein near the active site of the enzyme, consistent with the role of the protein in substrate binding. Additional measurements of the P-protein-P-RNA interface will lead to a better understanding of the synergy of these two components in catalyzing pre-tRNA cleavage.

Protein component
The protein component of bacterial RNase P decreases the catalytic requirement for monovalent and divalent cations [7,8] allowing efficient catalysis under physiological conditions. Recent kinetic studies demonstrate that addition of the protein component specifically increases the binding affinity of RNase P for pre-tRNA without increasing product inhibition [9], by contacting or promoting contacts to the 5-leader [60]. Moreover, the cleavage reaction is limited mainly by the association rate constant at subsaturating concentrations of pre-tRNA, suggesting that RNase P has evolved to catalytic `perfection', an achievement it shares with protein enzymes [2,61]. A specific effect of the protein on pre-tRNA binding is

Conclusions
Possessing lesser sidechain diversity than proteins, RNA may lack the conformational `rigidity' [2] necessary to function as a catalyst comparable to protein enzymes. Nonetheless, RNase P has been shown to attain catalytic efficiency comparable to some protein enzymes and to fold into a complex tertiary structure that is essential for catalysis. Significant advances have been made toward forming a molecular picture of the RNase-P-pre-tRNA complex.

Furthermore, current evidence places the protein component in close proximity to the active site and indicates that the protein directly plays a role in substrate recognition. Nevertheless, interpretation of mechanistic data begs for higher resolution structural information either from techniques such as crosslinking and NAIM, or from an X-ray crystal structure. In addition, the elucidation of the sites of functional metal ions, and the continued investigation of the roles of metals and RNA or protein functional groups in stabilization of the transition state is essential.

This paper analyzes metal-rescue of phosphorothioate effects on P4-P6 folding in light of the X-ray crystal structure of this domain. These data indicate that the lack of a metal-rescue effect cannot be interpreted as the lack of metal-ion binding and that metal-rescue potentially detects outer-sphere as well as inner-sphere metal-binding. 49.

J Mol Biol 1999, 290:433-445. Incorporation of a cleavage site RP or SP-phosphorothioate in pre-tRNA decreases catalysis by B. subtilis RNase P RNA by 104-fold, but does not affect ground-state binding. Both Mn2+ and Cd2+ rescue cleavage, but, in contrast to the E. coli ribozyme, Cd2+ rescue requires added Mg2+ or Ca2+. 52.

Nucleic Acids Res 2000, 28:720-727. This paper analyzes the role of metal-ion stabilization of the 3-oxyanion leaving group in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by RNase P RNA. Cleavage is essentially abolished at the canonical site in the presence of the 3-S-phosphorothiolate; this effect is not rescuable by thiophilic metal ions. 53.

Phosphorothioate substitutions were incorporated at six specific positions in the P4 region of a self-cleaving ribozyme/pre-tRNA conjugate (derived from E. coli RNase P RNA), to disrupt binding of catalytic magnesium ions. Three of the six modified conjugates displayed significant (>1000-fold) decreases in self-cleavage, while rescue of self-cleavage by Mn2+ or Cd2+ was observed for the A67 position only (for both RP and SP diastereomers).
