Abstract--Building upon the potent anti-HIV-1 activities observed for the 3-dimethylamino-4-benzylpyridinone 2, and the corresponding 4-aryloxypyridinone analogue 3, a concise and efficient route to the 3-iodo-4-aryloxypyridinones 14a­c (IOPY's) was developed. This involved reaction of the 4-hydroxy substituted pyridinone 10 with the requisite dichloroiodobenzene reagent 11. IOPY compound 14c is active at IC50=1­45 nM against wild type HIV-1 and a panel of six major simple/double HIV mutant strains. # 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) involving the use of drug combinations to treat AIDS has had a dramatic impact on the morbidity and mortality of individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).1,2 However, in spite of this success there are continuing problems of toxicity and drug resistance, including the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of HIV-1.3,4 It is thus important to continually develop more potent and less aggressive drugs for the treatment of HIV. In this context, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are finding increasing use in multi-drug regimens.5 At present, only three molecules of this family, nevirapine (Viramune), delavirdine (Rescriptor) and efavirenz (Sustiva), are approved for the treatment of HIV infected patients.6 A contribution from our laboratories to this effort was the discovery that 3-amino-4-arylthiopyridinones7 of general structure 1 (Fig. 1) are potent inhibitors of wild type HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Preliminary SAR on

this series has led to the identification of the 3-dimethylamino-4-benzylpyridinone 2 as a promising lead compound.8 As part of an extensive optimisation programme on this new family of HIV-1 RT inhibitors,

we wanted to evaluate the potential of compound 3, the corresponding aryloxypyridinone analogue of 2. In a further, and larger context, our objective was to develop a synthetic route which would give easy and rapid access to a wide range of aryloxypyridinone analogues which are modified at the C-3 position. The development of such an approach based upon the reaction of 4hydroxy-2-pyridinones with hypervalent iodine reagents leading to a highly potent lead compound 14c in the aryloxypyridinone series is the subject of the present communication.

Chemistry 4-Thioarylpyridinones 1 are prepared by condensation of a requisite 4-chloropyridinone with a thiophenol derivative in a Michael addition/retro-Michael process.7 This transformation is dependent upon the presence of an electron withdrawing (ester or nitro) substituent at the C-3 position of the pyridinone ring. Following this strategy, the 4-chloro-3-carbethoxy-2-pyridinone 5 was reacted with the potassium anion of 3,5-dimethylphenol in refluxing DMF9 (Scheme 1). The derived condensation product 6 (94%) was then heated in aqueous HCl to effect hydrolyse­decarboxylation to giving the intermediate 7 (86%). Treatment of 7 with fuming nitric acid in acetic acid afforded the 3-nitropyridone 8 (55%). Reduction of the nitro group using tin(II) chloride dihydrate in ethyl acetate provided amine 9 (70%), which was subsequently converted to the target N,Ndimethyl substituted benzyloxypyridinone 3 under reductive alkylation conditions [HCHO (37 wt. % in water), NaBH3CN, MeCN; 85%]. Overall, eight steps were required to obtain 3, and although the yield of certain operations were high the conversion of 4 to 5 on reaction with POCl3 (average yield 40%) has proven difficult to optimise.7

Thus, as a general approach for subsequent analogue synthesis this route did not appear sufficiently attractive for our needs. For this reason, our attention was focused to a report by Kappe and El-Mariah concerning the reaction of 4-hydroxyquinolin-2-ones with (dichloroiodo)benzene.10 In this transformation both an aryloxy and an iodo substituent are introduced adjacent to each other on the pyridinone nucleus in essentially a single operation. Applying this methodology (Scheme 2), it was found that the reaction of 4-hydroxypyridinone 10 with the (dichloroiodo)arenes 11a­c, prepared by reaction of iodobenzene, 3-methyliodobenzene or 3,5-dimethyliodobenzene with chlorine gas, gave direct access to the 3-iodo-4-phenoxy substituted pyridinones 14a­c in excellent yields. The first step in this process involves formation of the aryliodonium ylides 12a­c, which on heating rearranges via the spiro-Meisenheimer11 intermediates 13a­c, to the observed product. This result was highly promising, as the presence of the iodo substituent at C-3 in compounds 14 opens up a broad range of opportunities to introduce diverse substituents at C-3 [particularly by halogen­metal exchange, Pd(0) and Cu+ based coupling techniques]. Pertinent to the present report, the formation of compounds 14 provided the opportunity to evaluate the influence of the iodine at the C-3 position on anti-HIV activity in the pyridinone series.

Anti-HIV-1 Test Results and Discussion Compounds 3 and 14a­c were evaluated for their antiHIV activity,12 and the results were compared to those for lead compound 2 (Table 1). To obtain a clear indication of the potential worth of the aryloxypyridinones, and in particular the 3-iodo substituted compounds 14a­c, a comparison was also made to the related HEPT analogues MKC-44213 and GCA-186,14 and to the three currently used NNRTI type drugs, nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz (Table 2). In an initial screen against wild-type HIV-1 and the two major mutant strains Y181C and K103N,15 it was found that replacement of the bridging CH2 group in 2 by an oxygen atom does not result in either a net gain or loss in activity. Both pyridinones 2 and 3 were found to be 10 times more active than MKC-442, but in the more direct comparison with GCA-186 (literature values),14 which also possesses the 3,5-dimethyl substitution in the phenyl ring, one sees that all three compounds are comparable in activity. Thus, the CH2 for O exchange is acceptable, indicating that we can incorporate this modification in further analogue studies. Looking next at the three iodo substituted pyridinone analogues 14a­ c. Nanomolar range activities were again observed for these molecules against the LAI strain. This result contrasts sharply with the only marginal activity reported for the corresponding iodo-HEPT compound 15 (IC50=3.6 mM).16 Noteworthy was the observation that introduction of the methyl groups on the phenyl ring in compounds 14 resulted in a considerable improvement in the activities against the two mutant strains, and in particular K103N (14c; IC50=0.003 mM). Indeed 14c is 10 times more active against this major mutant than either compound 2 or GCA-186. A further 5­10 times improvement in activity was also observed against the Y181C mutant. The presence of the iodine atom in the aryloxpyridinones 14a­c thus has a positive impact on activity (contrary to earlier indications).16 The exact nature of the contribution of the iodine atom to the binding of these NNRTI type molecules in RT is not understood at present, but the hydrophobic properties of this substituent, its polarisability and/or its effective volume are three factors which may favour binding, and thus distinguish compounds 14 from the corresponding compound 7 (IC50=0.50 mM) in which this group is absent. In light of the interesting activities found for 14c, it was tested against a larger panel of HIV-1 mutant strains (Table 2). It is immediately seen that, relative to lead molecule 2, there is a significant gain in activity against

all the mutant strains, and in particular a 20-fold improvement in activity against the K103N+Y181C double mutant. In addition, with the exception of the values found for the Y181C mutant, this molecule has a much better profile in vitro than efavirenz, the current NNRTI standard in combination therapy. Note in particular that efavirenz is inactive against K103N+K100I, and that both efavirenz and 14c remain equipotent against the K103N+Y181C double mutant. Compound 14c thus represents an interesting new lead molecule for the development of pyridinone based antiHIV agents. This avenue of research is actively being persuaded, as is the original objective of using the iodo substituent in these pyridinones as a `handle' to introduce varied and diverse functionality at C-3 of the pyridinone ring.
