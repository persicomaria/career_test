A Structural Switch in a Mutant Insulin Exposes Key Residues for Receptor Binding
Svend Ludvigsen, Helle B. Olsen and Niels C. Kaarsholm*
Â Novo Nordisk A/S, Novo Alle 1 DK-2880 Bagsvñrd, Denmark Despite years of effort to clarify the structural basis of insulin receptor binding no clear consensus has emerged. It is generally believed that insulin receptor binding is accompanied by some degree of conformational change in the carboxy-terminal of the insulin B-chain. In particular, while most substitutions for PheB24 lead to inactive species, glycine or D-amino acids are well tolerated in this position. Here we assess the conformation change by solving the solution structure of the biologically active (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin mutant. The structure in aqueous solution at pH 8 reveals a subtle, albeit well-de®ned rearrangement of the C-terminal decapeptide involving a perturbation of the B20-23 turn, which allows the PheB25 residue to occupy the position normally taken up by PheB24 in native insulin. The new protein surface exposed rationalizes the receptor binding properties of a series of insulin analogs. We suggest that the structural switch is forced by the structure of the underlying core of species invariant residues and that an analogous rearrangement of the C-terminal of the B-chain occurs in native insulin on binding to its receptor.

Insulin is stored as hexameric aggregates in the secretory granules of the pancreatic b-cells. In response to physiological stimuli, the hormone is released into the bloodstream where it exists in the biologically active, monomeric form at concentrations in the 10À9 to 10À12 M range (Steiner, 1976). Molecular recognition at speci®c cell-surface receptors initiates a cascade of signaling events leading to the ultimate uptake of glucose by the target cells. Insulin is composed of two polypeptide chains, the A-chain (21 residues) and the B-chain (30 residues), and contains one intrachain and two interchain disul®de bridges. The X-ray structures of insulin hexamers (Baker et al., 1988; Figure 1) reveal the surfaces involved in the reversible self-association processes responsible for the controlled release of the biologically active monomeric species. In contrast, the molAbbreviations used: NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; PDB, Protein Data Bank.

ecular surfaces involved in insulin receptor binding are less well de®ned. Except for the structure of despentapeptide-(B26-B30) insulin (Bi et al., 1984), all of the published insulin X-ray structures are aggregated species. Thus, the current view of insulin structure-function relationships is derived primarily from insulin hexamer crystal structures and from correlations of biological potency with chemically modi®ed and/or naturally occuring insulin mutants. This approach has its limitations due to the lack of solution structures of the modi®ed insulins in the monomeric state and because the extent (if any) of the conformational change necessary for high-af®nity receptor binding is unknown. A more complete picture of insulin structure-activity relationships would include NMR-derived structures of insulin species tailored to remain in the monomeric state under physiologically relevant conditions (Olsen et al., 1996). However, due to the inherent self-association pattern of the hormone, the necessary manipulations of solvent conditions to effect monomerization often obscure the signi®cance of

Structural Switch in a Mutant Insulin Structure

Mutant design and structure We have designed a mutant (B16 Tyr 3 Glu, B24 Phe 3 Gly, desB30)-insulin which is suitable for high-resolution NMR structural work in aqueous solution (pH 8). Accordingly, in the absence of zinc ion the B16 Tyr 3 Glu mutation effects monomerization at mM concentrations under these conditions (Olsen et al., 1996). Potency measurements (Moody et al., 1974) show that the constituent mutants, i.e. (desB30), (GluB16, desB30) and (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulins exhibit relative activities of 116%, 15.8%, and 14.9%, respectively, consistent with the neutral effect of the B24 Phe to Gly substitution while glutamate in the B16 position independently contributes sixfold decrease in biological activity. Although the exchange rate of several amide protons is fast at pH 8.0, the sequential assignment È approach (Wuthrich, 1986) leads to a near-complete assignment of the proton NMR spectra. NOESY spectra are loaded with cross-peaks between aromatic ring-systems and methyl groups, Figure 2a, indicating numerous close contacts between these groups. Complete analysis reveals cross-peaks between PheB25 and ValB12/LeuB15, TyrB26 and LeuB11/ValB12/LeuB15, and between TyrA19 and IleA2/ValA3/LeuB11/LeuB15, i.e. the aromatic side-chains of PheB25 and TyrB26 are compactly folded against the hydrophobic core of the molecule. Effect of pH and solvent composition As a further control of the NMR assignments at pH 8.0, complete sequential assignments were obtained in water at pH 2.0 where the B24 Gly and B16 Glu mutations also suf®ce to effect monomerization at millimolar concentration. All NOESY cross-peaks between aromatic ring-systems and methyl groups found at pH 8.0 are also observed at pH 2.0 (Figure 2b), demonstrating the same packing of aromatic side-chains against the hydrophobic core. Indeed, the pH 2.0 spectra exhibits all NOE contacts observed at pH 8.0 as well as additional ones. Structures based on distance and dihedral restraints (structural statistics, Table 1) derived from the NMR data at pH 8.0, Figure 2d, shows that the arrangement of helices does not differ from those found in either crystal structures of T6 insulin hexamers (Baker et al., 1988), the solution structure of HisB16 insulin at pH 2.4 (Ludvigsen et al., 1994), or in the solution structure of GlyB24 insulin in 20% acetic acid (Hua et al., 1991). The accuracy of the structure in the NH2-terminal A-chain helix (A2 to A9) is somewhat poorer in (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)insulin than in the other solution structures as a consequence of the faster exchange of amide protons at pH 8.0. In contrast, the structure in the B20-B30 region of (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin at pH 8.0 is clearly different from that observed in the GlyB24 mutant determined in the

Figure 1. X-ray structure (Baker et al., 1988) of the insulin hexamer showing the symmetrical arrangement of three dimers around a vertical 3-fold axis. The dimer in front is shown schematically with helices and b-strands, whereas the other two are in surface representation, orange and green, respectively. The monomer is composed of two polypeptide chains, the A-chain (A1 to A21), which folds into a helix-loophelix motif, and the B-chain (B1 to B30) containing an N-terminal arm, a central helix and a C-terminal b-strand (¯at arrow). B-Chain residues contribute to the interface between monomers in the dimer including an antiparallel b-sheet formed by the B-chain C termini and side-chains of the central helices. The interface between dimers involves a distinct set of protein-protein contacts and is mainly composed of residues in the N-terminal part of the B-chain with contributions from residues in the C-terminal A-chain helix and the B-chain helix, i.e. B1, B2 and B4 from one dimer interact with residues A13, A14, B1 and B16 to B20 of the opposing dimer (see Baker et al., 1988, for details). Three cystine bridges A6 ± A11, A7 ± B7, and A20 ± B19 are shown in yellow in stick representation. Figure of molecule was produced using Insight (Molecular Simulations Inc.).

the resulting structures (Hua et al., 1991, 1993a,b). Nevertheless, it is generally believed that insulin receptor binding is accompanied by some degree of conformational change in the carboxy-terminal of the B-chain. Earlier studies have shown that the orientation and ¯exibility of the B-chain b-turn (B20 to B23) and b-strand (B24 to B28) appear crucial for the biological activity of insulin. In particular, the importance of phenylalanine in position B24 (PheB24) to bioactivity has been inferred from studies of low potency B24 analogs. Remarkably, however, certain B24 substitutions are well tolerated including glycine and certain D-amino acids (Mirmara & Tager, 1989). Here we assess the importance of the structure in the B20-B28 region to biological activity.

In c contacts involving PheB25 and TyrB26 as well as PheB1 are absent, and only contacts from TyrA19 to IleA2, LeuB11, and LeuB15 together with intraresidual contacts in LeuB11 and ValB12 are observed. d, An ensemble of solution structures for (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin in aqueous solution at pH 8.0. e, The corresponding ensemble for GlyB24-insulin (Hua et al., 1991) from Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (accession number 1HIT) as determined in 20%/80% CD3COOH/H2O. Note that the C-terminal of the B-chain is reasonably well de®ned in aqueous solution (d), while the presence of acetic acid as cosolvent causes unfolding of this region of the molecule in GlyB24 (e) and (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30) insulins (c). NMR samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein powder in 10%/90% 2H2O/H2O to approximately 1 mM concentration and adjusting the pH as desired by addition of small volumes of 1 M HCl or NaOH. All pH meter readings are without correction for isotope effects. Two-dimensional 1H-1H NMR spectra were recorded at 600 MHz as described (Olsen et al., 1996). Spectral assignments were performed using the program PRONTO (Kjñr et al.,1991). Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) as observed relative to dioxane (3.75 ppm). Distance restraints for subsequent structure calculation were obtained from integrated NOESY cross-peaks classi®ed as either weak, medium or strong Ê corresponding to upper distance restraints of 5.0, 3.3, and 2.7 A, respectively, based on NOESY spectra with mixing times 100, 150, and 200 ms conservatively interpreted in order to avoid spin diffussion based restraints. For disÊ tance restraints involving methyl groups, an additional 0.5 A was added to the upper limit. f-angle restraints were obtained from 3JHNHa coupling constants, À60 Æ 30 (2 Hz to 4 Hz), À70 Æ 30 (4 Hz to 6 Hz), À120 Æ 60 (6 Hz to 8 Hz), and À120 Æ 35 (8 Hz to 10 Hz).

presence of 20% acetic acid as co-solvent (Hua et al., 1991). As shown in Figure 2e, the B20-B30 region of the latter structure is unfolded and detached from the core of the molecule under these conditions. The NOESY spectrum of (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin in 20%/80% deuterated acetic acid/water (Figure 2c) was recorded under similar conditions as were used in the NOESY spectrum of GlyB24-insulin (Hua

et al., 1991). As shown in Figure 2c, the presence of co-solvent introduces the loss of NOESY crosspeaks between the aromatic side-chains of PheB1, PheB25 and TyrB26 and the core methyl groups consistent with partial unfolding af the C and Nterminal portions of the mutant B-chain. Hence, we conclude that the PheB24 3 Gly mutation destabilizes the insulin molecule to the extent that 20% acetic acid induces partial unfolding.

No residues fall into dissallowed regions as displayed by PROCHECK_NMR and an ``equivalent Ê resolution'' is estimated to 3.1 A.

Figure 3. Representative solution structures of: a, (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin at pH 8.0; and b, HisB16-insulin (PDB code 1HLS) at pH 2.4 in aqueous solution (Ludvigsen et al., 1994) together with the corresponding surface representations (c and d). The helical stretches (in a and b) are shown in blue, and selected side-chains are annotated. In b, the side-chains of B24, B25 and B26 are arranged as is observed in crystal structures of wild-type insulin. In a, PheB25 has moved into the position usually occupied by PheB24. This structural change is quantitatively characterÊ ized by a value of 0.42(Æ0.17) A for the mean displacement of the Ca atom of PheB25 between the average and ensemble structures of the (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-mutant. Furthermore, when the helical regions (A2 to A9, A14 to A20 and B9 to B19) are used to align the ensemble of structures for each Ê mutant, a displacement of only 1 A is obtained between the average positions of the PheB25 Ca atom of the (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin and PheB24 Ca atom of HisB16-insulin. Accordingly, the average values of torsion angles, w1 and w2, are 50.3(Æ4.2) and À96.8(Æ5.6) , respectively, for the PheB25 residue in the present mutant as compared to values of 53.5(Æ5.3) and À79.2(Æ4.0) , respectively, for the equivalent PheB24 residue in the HisB16 mutant structure. TyrB26 remains approximately in its original position. Overall, this change perturbs the turn following the central B-chain helix and bends the usual extended structure of the C-terminal strand. The surface shown in d is rotated a little around the vertical axis compared to b to display the side-chains of B24 and B26 which are clearly differently exposed as compared to c. Side-chains of interest and importance for receptor binding are color-coded and annotated with sequence position in c and d. In a and c the bend of the C-terminal residues and the accompanying reorientation result in the exposure of a different surface compared to b and d, i.e. in particular ValA3 and TyrB26 become more exposed. Mutant insulins were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, fermented in yeast, and puri®ed as described (Markussen et al., 1987; Brange et al., 1988). Mutants are expressed as single-chain miniproinsulin precursors, PheB1...LysB29-Ala-Ala-Lys-GlyA1...AsnA21. The connecting peptide is cleaved off using lysyl endopeptidase (Achromobacter protease I, EC 3.4.21.50; Wako Inc., Osaka, Japan). The removal of ThrB30 has no effect on the biological potency. Figures of molecules were produced using Insight (Molecular Simulations Inc.)

observed in the mutant structure. Instead, the B20-B25 region undergoes a rearrangement whereby a perturbation of the usual B20-B23 turn allows PheB25 to ®t into the pocket normally occupied by PheB24. TyrB26 ®ts approximately into its normal position, however, the resulting overall change of the structure in B23 to B28 inhibits this region from forming an antiparallel b-sheet with another insulin molecule necessary for dimer formation. Finally, the residues ThrB27 to LysB29 are disordered in the (GluB16, GlyB24, desB30)-insulin structure. A similar feature is also seen for other mutant insulin structures (Olsen et al., 1996; Kurapkat et al., 1997) and leads to an increased exposure of the N-terminal residues of the A-chain, in particular GlyA1, IleA2, and ValA3 all considered important for receptor binding (Cosmatos et al., 1978; Nakagawa & Tager,

1992). The hydrogen bonding pattern of the mutant is almost equivalent to that reported in HisB16-insulin (Ludvigsen et al., 1994) except for a few differences re¯ecting the structural changes in the region from GlyB20 to the C-terminal of the B-chain. TyrB26 HN to TyrA19 CO is observed in the present study whereas PheB25 HN is donor in conventional insulin solution structures as well as in the T6 crystal structure. GlyB20 HN and LeuB15 CO are new potential hydrogen bonding partners not observed in previous insulin solution structures, while the bond usually established between AsnA21 HN and GlyB23 CO is absent from the present structure. In contrast with the classical insulin structure, the surface exposed by the mutant contains most of the residues known to be critical for insulin bioactivity (Pullen et al., 1976; Dodson et al., 1983;

6 Figure 3c and d). Accordingly, our modeling studies show that D-amino acids ®t much better into the B24 position of the mutant structure than the corresponding L-isomers. We conclude that the D-amino acids in position B24 most likely stabilize the ``active'' conformation, consistent with the increased receptor binding potencies of D-Ala and D-PheB24 insulins (Mirmira & Tager, 1989; Kobayashi et al., 1982). Indeed, the exposure of the insulin pharmacophore in the mutant structure helps rationalize most structure activity data in the literature. A putative rearrangement of the C-terminal peptide in wild-type insulin prior to receptor binding will expose the same surface as displayed in Figure 3c, provided that PheB25 reorientated into the position normally taken up by B26 and the last ®ve residues, B26 to B30, subsequently move just enough to expose A1 to A3. Such a model for activated insulin agrees with potency data of truncated insulins and mutants thereof (Mirmira & Tager, 1989; Nakagawa & Tager, 1986). In conlusion, the present work emphasizes that the substitution of PheB24 to Gly is a dramatic change, the penalty being a reduction in folding stability. However, in aqueous solution the underlying hydrophobic core directs a reorientation of exposed side-chains to readopt a functional surface. This function is consistent with the conservation among species of the core residues of the molecule and the retention of a closely packed hydrophobic core in all known insulin structures. Coordinates and NMR restraint data have been deposited with the PDB (accession codes 1A7F and R1A7FMR).
