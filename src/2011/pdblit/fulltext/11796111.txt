Spontaneous chromophore formation is probably the key feature for the remarkable success of GFPs (Green Fluorescent Proteins) and related proteins in fluorescence microscopy. Though a quantitative analysis of the involved energetics still remains elusive, substantial progress has been made in identifying the steps of chromophore biosynthesis and the contribution of individual residues and surrounding protein matrix. The latter clearly enforces a peculiar configuration of the pre-cyclized chromophore-forming tripeptide. However, it is debated whether a mechanical compression is also at play in triggering backbone cyclization. Here, by molecular dynamics and potential of mean force calculations, we estimate the contribution of the protein scaffold in promoting the proximity of reacting atoms- and hence backbone cyclization - by a sort of compression mechanism. Comparing several mutants we highlight the role of some surrounding residues. Finally, we analyze the case of HAL (Histidine Ammonia-Lyase) active site, which undergoes an analogous cyclization reaction. Ó 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction One outstanding example of protein post-translational modifications is the autocatalytic formation of the chromophore in the family of Fluorescent Proteins (FPs), of which the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was the first member to be discovered. Thanks to the spontaneous chromophore biosynthesis, FPs can be functionally expressed in host cells and used to create fluorescent chimeras by molecular biology techniques, allowing noninvasive fluorescent labeling of proteins in living cells [1,2]. Several studies have helped to identify the steps involved in chromophore synthesis, and to reach at least a partial agreement on their sequence [3,4]. Chromophore formation (Fig. 1, upper panel) proceeds within the native GFP structure (i.e. no chromophore is formed under denaturing conditions), and first entails backbone cyclization at the Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67 tripeptide through nucleophilic attack of the amide group of Gly67 onto the carbonyl group of Ser65. Molecular oxygen is required for the subsequent oxidation reaction, leading to the mature chromophore with the characteristic delocalized electronic p-system. Oxidation is the rate limiting step with a time constant of several minutes (120 min in wild type GFP [5], 27 min in the S65T variant [6], from measurements in living cells), whereas backbone cyclization time constant is estimated to be of few minutes [7,8].

One water molecule is also abstracted from the structure, and both the (i) cyclization-dehydration-oxidation [9,3] and the (ii) cyclization-oxidation-dehydration [8,10] mechanisms have been proposed based on various experimental findings. Evidence for mechanism (i) comes from X-ray studies of chemically reduced GFPs, revealing that reduction of the mature chromophore yields an enolate moiety where the imidazolone ring remains cyclic and dehydrated, but the structure is no longer oxidized [3]. Hence, oxidation seems not to be essential for imidazolone ring stability, whereas dehydration is required for kinetically trapping the unstable cyclic structure. Support for (ii) comes instead from the kinetic trace of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) preceding the evolution in fluorescence acquisition in the GFP-trix variant (F64L/F99S/M153T/ V163A/A206K) [8]. X-ray structure of the Y66L mutant [11] also supports mechanism (ii), in that the tripeptide undergoes oxidation while maintaining the hydroxyl group (i.e. it is unable to dehydrate). Within the b-barrel fold of GFP, the chromophore is positioned between two alpha-helix portions (see Fig. 2), the axes of which form an angle of about 80° with one another. The chromophorebearing site is surrounded by several water molecules and by two residues Arg96 and Glu222, which are highly conserved among FPs. Mutation of Arg96 to Ala [9], or that of Glu222 to Gln [12], dramatically slows chromophore maturation, the latter only at acidic and physiological pH. Comprehensive targeted mutagenesis [13] points to a role for Arg96 in acidifying N67 (Fig. 1), and hence facilitating nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl at 65.

Glu222 presumably acts as a base in this proton abstraction mechanisms, and/or it may mediate dehydrogenation by deprotonating CA66 [4,14]. Any aromatic residue (Phe, His and Trp) at position 66 preserves fluorescence [5], and several other non-aromatic residues were tried at position 66, some, such as Gly and Ser [15,16] and Leu [17], leading to different reaction products. By contrast, all mutants not including a Glycine at position 67 resulted in complete loss of fluorescence [18]. The crystal structure of a mutant containing Alanine at position 67 (S65A/Y66S/G67A) reveals a 310-helix configuration that presumably inhibits backbone cyclization by stabilizing an alternative conformation [15]. By a force field-based computational analysis, Zimmer and coworkers showed that the low-energy pre-cyclization conformations of the chromophore-forming residues are in a unique ``tight-turn" conformation (the mechanical compression hypothe-

sis), in which the distance between C65 and N67 is shorter than the sum of the Van der Waals radii of the two atoms, and the nitrogen lone pair of residue 67 is oriented for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of Ser65 [19,14]. They suggested that the remainder of the protein may exert a strain between the two atoms, enforcing the tight-turn conformation. The short C65 and N67 distance was confirmed by X-ray studies on the pre-cyclized M96R mutant, (Protein Data Bank (PDB) [20] code 2AWJ [13]). The fact that the Gly-Gly-Gly tripeptide undergoes cyclization in the S65G/Y66G mutant (GGG mutant hereafter) [9] argues, to some extent, against the mechanical compression hypothesis. Indeed the permanence of cyclization upon substitution with the least bulky amino acid (i.e. Gly) would imply that no steric compression is imposed by the protein scaffold. Moreover, the GGG mutant cyclizes exclusively in aerobic conditions, indicating that cyclization is coupled to oxidation, at least in this mutant.

A protein in which the mechanical compression seems to play a role is Histidine Ammonia-Lyase (HAL), which features a 4-methylidene-imidazole-5-one (MIO) in its active site. MIO forms autocatalytically from the residues of the segment Ala142-Ser143-Gly144, belonging to a short loop between an a-helix and a b-strand [21]. Although in completely different protein folds (see Fig. 2), GFP chromophore and HAL MIO show very similar reaction steps and intermediates (Fig. 1). Baedeker et al. constructed the HAL variants F329A and F329G, differing from a methyl(ene) group [22]. The side chain of 329 is in Van der Waals contact with the MIO tripeptide backbone. The crystal structure revealed that the cyclization reaction had taken place only in the F329A mutant. Since a methyl (ene) group is chemically inactive, and no change is observed in the backbone conformation around position 329, they concluded that residue at position 329 has a steric role during MIO formation. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to address a possible compression mechanism on the first step of chromophore formation, i.e. cyclization reaction by nucleophylic attack of N67 on C65. We carry out an evaluation of the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) along the reaction coordinate defined as the distance between N67 and C65 in GFP. We first compare the PMF in the whole protein with that of a portion of the protein containing the chromogenic tripeptide outside the scaffold. We then examine the case of various mutants and compare these results with the analogous PMF for the case of MIO formation in HAL.

2. Methods As starting coordinates for our study we used the X-ray structures of the R96M mutant of solGFP (solGFP is, in turn, the F64L/ S65T/F99S/M153T/V163A mutant of wild type GFP) [13], the GGG mutant of solGFP [9], and the F239G mutant of HAL [22]. The PDB codes of these three structures are, respectively, 2AWJ, 1QYO and 1GK2. In the case of R96M, the original solGFP variant in the pre-cyclization state was obtained by converting the Methionine residue at position 96 back into an Arginine. From solGFP, we cut out two reference peptides, the first formed by five residues (5pept), including the three residues forming the chromophore (Thr65 Tyr66 Gly67) and the two which the chromophore is linked to (Leu64 Val68), and the second (13pept) formed by thirteen residues (58-PTLVTTLTYGVAC-70). A reference peptide with thirteen residues was obtained also from the GGG mutant (13peptGGG). Notice that we introduced the Q69A substitution in order to avoid spurious interactions of the Gln69 side chain with the backbone, as within the protein this residue is involved in interactions with parts of the protein not included in the peptide.

HAL F329G coordinates refer to a variant which does not develop the MIO moiety. From this structure, the F329A mutant in a precyclization state was obtained converting the Glycine residue at position 329 into an Alanine. In order to reduce the computational cost, the HAL was modeled only by one of the four monomers. This was subsequently cut around the MIO region (see Fig. 2), in such a way as to include the sequences of residues Thr1-Gly207, Gln298Ala342 and Pro401-Leu427 (according to the original PDB file) and the molecules of water within 4 Åof the MIO present in the crystal structure. The Leap program of the Amber 10 package [23] was used to perform the various mutations, and to add missing side-chains and hydrogen atoms where needed. The protonation of the Histidine residues was inferred from the presence of hydrogen donors or acceptors in the surroundings of their imidazole group, as described previously [24]. Each system was neutralized with a different number of Na+ or ClÀ ions, and solvated in a truncated octahedron box of TIP3P water molecules, with a minimum distance of 8 Å between the protein and each side of the box. We employed the Cornell et al. force field (Amber94) [25], in some cases including modifications as described below. A Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency c of 2 psÀ1 was used to keep the temperature at 300 K. Conditions of constant pressure were maintained by means of a Berendsen barostat, with a pressure relaxation time sp of 1 ps and a reference pressure of 1 atm. The systems were initially minimized by 1000 steps of steepest descent and conjugate gradient, keeping a restraint of 8 kcal/mol on the atoms in the X-ray structures, while leaving the hydrogen atoms and bulk-water molecules free. Water density was equilibrated during 20 ps of molecular dynamics, keeping the same restraints. Afterwards, the entire systems were minimized without restraints, and finally equilibrated during 1 ns of molecular dynamics. In the case of HAL, restraints of 8 kcal/mol were kept on the Ca atoms in contact with the other monomers in the original tetrameric structure, and on those belonging to the cut residues (Gly207, Gln298, Ala342, Pro401, Leu427). We were interested in estimating the PMF along the coordinate of the C65­N67 distance in the different structures. Because of the repulsion between Van der Waals spheres (Fig. 3, left panel), configurations with distance below 3 Å cannot be sampled. In order to be able to explore the PMF at shorter distances, we introduced some modifications to the force field. In detail, we created two fictitious bonds between C65­N67 and O65­N67, i.e. the atoms involved in the cyclization reaction (Fig. 3, right panel). As Van der Waals interactions are only calculated between atoms separated by at least three bonds, the undesired VdW terms are automatically neglected.

The force field parameters for the intermediate cyclic structure (discussed in the text) were also calculated. The structure is shown in Fig. 4. Table 1 compares the partial charges of the open structure with those of the cyclic intermediate. The charges for the open structure are those of Amber94. The charges for the cyclic structure are obtained via the usual RESP fitting [26] of the electrostatic potential calculated at the Hartree­Fock level with a 6-31G* basis set. The structure is depicted in Fig. 4, and was capped with an acetyl group (-CO-CH3) on N65 and a methylamide group (-NH-CH3) on C67. This structure was optimized with B3LYP/6-31G*. Bond lengths and angles and force constants were assigned in analogy with Amber94. In order to explore the PMF again along the C65­ N67 coordinate for distances larger than the equilibrium bond length, we introduced modifications in the force field analogous to those for the opening reactions: we put to zero the force constant of the C65­N67 bond, and of all the angles and dihedrals involving C65 and N67. Despite treating reactions involving covalent bond breaking and formation, we make use of a classic (i.e. non-quantum mechanics) force field description. Though aware of feasible hybrid QM/MM schemes, enough efficient for extensive sampling along reaction coordinates, we choose at this stage to stick to a molecular-mechanics treatment and include the previously described modifications in the force field, in order to obtain an effective description of the contribution of the protein scaffold. In fact, we performed preliminary QM/MM calculations (not reported here) using tight-binding density functional theory (DFTB) [27]. In particular, we simulated the hydrogen-transfer mechanism, i.e. the reaction depicted in Fig. 4, within the protein (the former treated with DFTB, the surrounding protein at the MM level). Because of the high energy barrier of the reaction, no sampling could be obtained in the proximity of the transition state. The inclusion of some key residues in the QM region (such as Arg96 and Glu222), could help to lower the barrier, though at the expenses of the computational cost.

The PMF was obtained by Umbrella Sampling (US), combining the results with the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) [28]. Within a molecular dynamics trajectory i, the PMF along a generalized coordinate s, Fi(s), is obtained via Boltzmann inversion using

where qi(s) is the distribution of s during the trajectory. In order to efficiently explore the relevant values of s, it is convenient to introduce ad hoc potentials terms Wi(s) that can be subsequently taken out according to

The WHAM method efficiently computes the Ai in order to combine together the various segment of Fi(s). Trajectories of 400­500 ps were generated for evenly 0.25 Åspaced windows within the relevant region, with a harmonic force constant k of 3 kcal/mol/Å2 or 10 kcal/mol/Å2 on the C65­N67 distance. A time step of 2 fs was used for all simulations, and each window was equilibrated during 100 ps, starting from the last configuration of the previous window. The self-consistent set of WHAM equations were iterated until changes in the free energy constants Fi were less than 10À5 kcal/mol. In all PMF calculations, the boostrap analysis [29] afforded errors below 0.1 kcal/mol. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Peptide vs. protein A possible compression exerted by the protein on the chromophore-forming tripeptide is best explored by evaluating the Potential of Mean Force (PMF) along the reaction coordinate of the

cyclization, namely the C65­N67 distance. The PMF indeed describes the contributions of the surrounding structure projected onto the relevant coordinate(s) and averaged over the various conformations explored during the dynamics. We analyzed the contribution of the protein scaffold by calculating the PMF for the entire (pre-cyclized) solGFP protein, and compared it with that of a portion containing 62-LTYGV-68 (5pept). The analysis with the full force field (see Fig. 5, left panel), shows that the peptide possesses a double-well shaped PMF, with two minima at 3.1 and 3.9 Å. In the protein the larger-distance minimum is excluded, because of the presence of surrounding residues, and the short-distance minimum is shifted to a slightly lower value. Though this small difference already hints at a mechanical role of the scaffold, it is interesting to follow the behaviour at shorter distances. To this aim, we carried out the US analysis excluding the VdW interactions between C65 and N67 and between N67 and O65 (``novdw"), as described in the methods section. Indeed the VdW energy term sternly increases as dÀ12 as the distance d between the two atoms gets shorter than the equilibrium VdW distance. Dropping the VdW term between the two pairs of atoms is an effective way of mimicking the formation of the C65­N67 covalent bond. How much this approach is able to capture the relevant features of this reaction will be discussed later on. When these interactions are excluded (see Fig. 5, right panel), solGFP minimum drops at 2.3 Å. This configuration is only rela6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 solGFP 5pept

tively minimal for 5pept, its absolute minimum being at around 3.5 Å. In the case of solGFP, the configuration at 2.2 Å is energetically favored by around 5 kcal/mol with respect to the configuration at 3 Å, which corresponds to the distance at equilibrium with the full force field. This contribution, absent in the free peptide, is a sort of mechanical compression uniquely exerted by the scaffold surrounding the chromophore. 3.2. Comparison between mutants The compression hypothesis was previously questioned because the cyclization reaction takes place also in the GGG mutant [9]. Here, the replacement of the bulky side-chains of Ser65 and Tyr66 by a single hydrogen atom (Glycine side chain) still results in effective backbone cyclization. By comparing the ``novdw" PMF in the two cases (solGFP and GGG) we find only negligible differences (Fig. 6, left panel): the same stabilization is present in both variants, pointing to a similar compression contribution. Indeed, Tyr66 side chain, being half-way between C65 and N67, has no direct role in pushing together one or the other of the two atoms (it may nonetheless stabilize a particular conformation promoting the reaction, though this is not disrupted by the Y66G mutation). The movement of residue 65 side chain is obligatory correlated with that of C65: however, the absence of Ser65 side chain does not seem to affect the stabilization at lower distances.

We also tried to understand how surrounding residues contribute to this stabilization. To this aim, we extended the ``novdw" PMF analysis to three mutants of GGG, produced by substituting three key residues, namely Gln94, Arg96 and Leu220, with the less bulky and apolar Alanine. Such analysis (Fig. 6, right panel) reveals the structural role of Arg96, whose substitution remarkably weakens the stabilization of the short-distance configuration. To a minor extent, also Gln94 seems to afford similar contributions. By contrast, substitution of Leu220 with Alanine produces only minor changes, in the direction of a better stabilization. Several studies highlighted the important role of Arg96 in driving the acidification of N67 [9,13]. Barondeau et al. also pointed out an additional role of Arg96 in inducing important structural rearrangements [15]. While our simulations are clearly not capable of analyzing the former function, our comparison in Fig. 6 shows indeed that the structure with Arg96 has a shorter equilibrium distance. This effect is subtle, but may contribute nonetheless to the importance of Arg96 at that position.

In the same figure we also compare the PMF of two HAL mutants, one with Alanine at position 329, where MIO is formed, the other with Glycine, which shows no modification of the normal amino acid chain from X-ray studies [22]. The nonviable Gly329 variant presents an equilibrium distance sligthly larger by 0.1 Å. The relatively conservative G329A mutation (the backbone conformation of the 328­330 portion shows no relevant difference in the two cases), thus results in a subtle change of the C­N distance distribution. Though small, such change is in line with a compression mechanism for MIO formation: Ala329 side chain pushes the preMIO tripeptide backbone enforcing shorter C­N distances. 3.4. The role of the a-helix kink We investigated the possibility that the determinant of the compression be the peculiar configuration of the central motif, i.e. the kink in the a-helix, the rest of the protein providing only the necessary scaffold to enforce this configuration. Thereby, we simulated two 13 amino acid peptides containing the solGFP and the GGG pre-chromophore motif (respectively 13pept, with sequence 58-PTLVTTLTYGVAC-70, and 13peptGGG, with sequence 58-PTLVTTLGGGVAC-70), imposing restraints on the backbone atoms in order to maintain the original kink present within the proteins. In detail, restraints were applied to the backbone (i.e. on the position of a-carbon, nitrogen, carbonyl oxygen and carbonyl carbon atoms) of residues from 58 to 64, and from 68 to 70. Two sets of simulations were performed with restraint force constants of 8 kcal/mol/Åand 3 kcal/mol/Å, in order to evaluate the impact of different restraints for maintaining the kink configuration. As we monitored by visual inspection, during the simulations the kink in the a-helix is conserved. Fig. 8 shows the PMF of the GGG and solGFP, together with those of their corresponding peptides. It can be noted how the restraints on the 13peptGGG result in a profile similar to the one of the entire protein (Fig. 8, left panel), suggesting that the kink in the a-helix gives an important contribution to the compression. The remaining discrepancy between the two curves is similar to the one found when comparing GGG with its R96A variant (Fig. 6, right panel). Hence, though the kink conformation is the main determinant of compression, some extra contribution may be provided by key residues surrounding the nascent chromophore. In the case of the 13pept (Fig. 8, right panel), the relative minimum is shifted towards larger distances than in solGFP. The different results between the two reference peptides arise from the presence of Threonine at position 65 of 13pept. Here, during

3.3. Compression in HAL We extended our study to MIO formation in HAL. The ``novdw" PMF along the coordinate of the correspondent C­N distance in HAL MIO is plotted in Fig. 7, showing that, in this case as well, a mechanism similar to the one seen in the GFP mutants is at play.

This hydrogen bond (Fig. 9, left panel), which in protein is less favored than that between Thr65 and Glu222 (Fig. 9, right panel), and is obviously not present in 13peptGGG, seems to stabilize configurations with larger C65-N67 distances.

3.5. The reverse reaction: opening the cycle Neglecting certain terms in the force field compels the question on how realistically the system and the reactions are described. In the cyclic intermediate (see Fig. 4), C65 is bound to N67, and H67 jumps on O65. Water molecules and/or surrounding residues presumably mediate this transfer, but the net result is a transfer of a hydrogen from N67 to O65. Within a force-field description, the changes in the region upon cyclization are, apart from C65­N67 bond formation: (i) changes in partial charges of C65, O65, N67, H67 (and, to a minor extent, all the backbone of 66, see Table 1), (ii) changing Lennard­Jones parameters of O65, H67 and, to a minor extent, C65. H67 becomes part of the hydroxyl group, and its VdW sphere is absorbed by the larger VdW of O65. Hence, the VdW envelope surface of the open structure in the short C65­ N67 distance configuration is only slightly different from that of the closed structure. Important contributions may nonetheless arise from the different charge distribution. We investigated the impact of this difference, in both 13peptGGG and GGG, by performing the same PMF evaluation on the reverse reaction, namely opening the closed structure by enlarging the C65­N67 distance. In order to simulate the intermediate cyclic structure of Fig. 4, the original Amber94 force field was modified as described in the Methods. Analogously to the previous section, the a-helix kink in the 13peptGGG was maintained through restraints on selected backbone atoms. Fig. 10 reports the PMF obtained with this analysis. The position of the minima at 2.1 Å compares nicely with the one in the PMF for the ``closing" reaction (see Fig. 8, left panel), confirming only a minor role of the changing Lennard­Jones and electrostatic parameters. A second minimum is present at larger distances, arising from configurations characterized in both cases by a different value of the O65C65-N66-CA66 dihedral angle. Since the validity of the ``opening" reaction analysis is restricted to shorter distance values, we attribute no particular significance to this feature. Overall, the two curves are remarkably similar, and this constitutes an evidence of

the role of the a-helix kink to the compression, as already seen in Section 3.4. However, again, despite the constrained kink, the position of the minimum is shifted of 0.2 Å in the GGG, revealing that some contribution of the external scaffold in promoting the cyclization reaction is still missing in the restrained 13peptGGG. 4. Conclusions Chromophore biosynthesis in Fluorescent Proteins entails a series of reaction steps quite uncommon in other proteins. Early Density Functional Theory calculations [30] showed that the supposedly first step, namely the backbone cyclization by nucleophylic attack, is endothermic. In order to account for these predictions and additional experimental evidence, Getzoff and coworkers suggested a conjugation-trapping mechanism [9], where the energy difference between the open configuration and the cyclic one is greatly diminished by the particular conformation of the peptide-bearing chromophore and by the presence of the surrounding protein matrix. The cyclization product, despite endothermic, is trapped by subsequent down-energy reactions, namely dehydration and oxidation. Our method to capture the contribution due to the protein matrix is based on a modification of the force field parameters in

molecular dynamics simulations. This method allows us to explore the intermediates between open and cyclic structures, by ignoring either the short-range VdW repulsion (in the ``closing" reaction) or the covalent bond (in the reverse ``opening" reaction) between the reacting carbon and nitrogen of the backbone. The corresponding free energy profiles (PMF) do not include the intrinsic energetics of covalent bond(s) formation or rupture, but effectively mimic the protein contribution to the cyclization reaction. Comparing the calculated PMF along the coordinate of the distance between C65­N67 of the entire protein to that of a portion of peptide containing the chromophore residues, we found accordingly that the formation of C65­N67 bond releases a certain strain in the structure. This is a major contribution of the protein scaffold along with others such as enforcing a particular orientation of the carbonyl group vs that of the amide, and providing important key side chains such as Arg96 and Glu222 (though none of them is strictly necessary for cyclization). Our analysis therefore fits in the proposed framework (i.e. the conjugation-trapping mechanism) and confirms a ``mechanic" role of the protein in favoring the cyclization reaction: this reaction remains endothermic also within the protein, but is made accessible thanks to the observed strain that destabilizes the open configuration. The presence of such a strain was questioned based on the capability of the GGG mutant (T65G/Y66G) to undergo cyclization [9], due to the substitution of bulky residues with the smaller Glycine. We showed that the distance distribution changes only negligibly upon these mutations, and hence the mechanical contribution of the protein is presumably at work also in the GGG mutant. Greatest part of the strain arises from the peculiar conformation of the inner a-helix, characterized by a kink right at the backbone of the chromogenic tripeptide. Indeed, when the kink configuration is enforced in the isolated peptide containing the tripeptide, most of the strain is recovered, as revealed by the PMF profile becoming similar to that within the protein. Nonetheless, a small but significant difference is still present, suggesting that the surrounding scaffold exerts a relevant part of the compression. A complete and quantitative analysis of the energetics of chromophore formation inside the protein is still lacking. However, several studies are providing precious bits of information on the role played by various factors. For example, intrinsic covalent-bond energy could be included within hybrid QM/MM schemes. As already reported in the method section, our preliminary attempts to use a QM/MM highlighted the need to identify all the residues/water molecules involved in the intermediate steps and transition states of the hydrogen-transfer reaction. While the reagents and products have been structurally determined, the identification of all the participating residues is still under scrutiny. Tackling these problems at a QM/MM level will be the subject of forthcoming work, and will probably require taking into account additional reaction coordinates, in a multidimensional PMF evaluation.
