Crystallization, data collection, structure determination and refinement of carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) in complex with Saccharin A solution of CAII at 10mg/ml was crystallized from 2.5-2.8 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 0.0001 M p-chloro-mercury-benzoic acid at 4°C. The saccharin-protein complex was obtained by soaking crystals at a concentration of 1mg/ml Saccharin in the crystallization solution for 12 hours. Prior to data collection crystals were cryo-protected with the crystallization solution containing 25% glycerol. Data were collected at 100K on a RIGAKU copper rotating anode (MSC) at 50 kV, 90 mA using an RAXIS IV++ image plate detector. Data processing and scaling were performed using the HKL2000 package[1]. The protein coordinates of CAII (PDB code. 1OQ5) were used for initial rigid body refinement of the structure followed by energy minimization, simulated annealing and B-value refinement using CNS[2]. Refinement at later stages was performed with the program SHELXL[3]. Here, at least 20 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization were performed with default restraints on bond distances angles and Bvalues. Five percent of all data were used for Rfree calculation. Amino acid side chains, ligand molecules, metal ions and water molecules were fitted into sigmaA weighted 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps using O[4] and COOT[5]. A data set collected to 1.7 Å resolution was refined to R=14.7%, Rfree=21.6% and was deposited in the PDB (PDB code 2Q1B). A second data set collected at 1.95 Å resolution with R=18.2%, Rfree=26.0% was also refined and deposited (PDB code 2Q38), since it showed slightly better density for the saccharin ligand, probably due to somewhat better occupancy. In both structures saccharin is bound in almost identical position. The final models were validated using Procheck[6]. Further details of the Xray crystal structure determination are given in Table 1.
