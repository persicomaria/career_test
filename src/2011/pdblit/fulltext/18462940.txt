Abstract--p38 inhibitors based on 3,4-dihydropyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidazin-2-one template were synthesized and their SAR explored. Benchmark compounds 30, 35, and 36 were found to be potent against the enzyme. Crystal structure of p38 in complex with 30 indicated a key p-stacking interaction with the pendant tyrosine residue-35 in the glycine-rich loop. Ó 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been shown that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase is key to blocking the pro-inflammatory signal transduction cascade initiated upon exposure of leukocytes to a number of extracellular stress stimuli.1­4 Although a number of structurally different inhibitors have been reported5 to inhibit p38 with varying degrees of selectivity, none has reached commercial status.6 This communication describes the utilization of 2-aryl pyridazinone as a suitable template for design of novel, selective p38 inhibitors. VX-745 (1) and its congeners (Fig. 1) are potent and highly selective inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase. They have been shown to occupy the ATP binding site of p38 MAP kinase in a unique fashion.9 The carbonyl group of these inhibitors induces a re-orientation of the amide bond between Met-109 and Gly-110 in the hinge region in order to form a dual hydrogen bond interaction. In almost all closely related kinases the residue adjacent to Met-109 bears a larger side chain which prevents facile amide bond re-orientation. A second hydrogen bond, thus, cannot be formed leading to poor binding affinity of these compounds for other kinases. The origin of the reported more than 1000-fold selectivity exhibited by these inhibitors is attributed to this sui generis `peptide flip' in combination with a small

Inhibitor design began with an analysis of X-ray crystallographic data and site-directed mutagenesis studies.10 Thus, two essential structural elements are required of a putative p38 inhibitor. First, a carbonyl group should be utilized as the anchor point. The kinase restructuring induced upon binding with the carbonyl group is critical for selectivity. Second, an aryl substituent suitably tethered to the main scaffold that enables its entry into the characteristic hydrophobic pocket-1, the entrance to which is lined by gate-keeper residue Thr-106. In addition to the above, occupation of a second partial hydrophobic pocket is expected to enhance potency and provide a handle for the manipulation of physical properties. Selection criteria for an appropriate scaffold were driven by the net dipole moment contributed by the designed template. The hinge region peptide backbone in p38 MAP kinase is organized in a staggered arrangement of the amide bonds as expected in the natural state. A re-orientation of the amide bond between Met-109 and Gly-110 is required in order to accommodate the carbonyl anchor of any designed inhibitor (Fig. 2). It is proposed that the re-organization of amide dipoles within the peptide backbone becomes facile with templates characterized by a high dipole moment. Credence for this proposal can be gleaned from a simple comparison of p38 inhibitory activities of structurally isomeric compounds 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). Both are expected to make similar contacts in the p38 active site thereby implying equipotency. However, 2 inhibits p38 (IC50 of 0.8 nM) with 30-fold greater binding affinity than 3 (IC50 of 30 nM). The net dipole moments for the scaffolds pyrimido-pyridazinone and pyrido-pyrimidone in 2 and 3, respectively, are calculated to be 9.2 and 3.0 Debye units, respectively.11 It can be speculated that the substantially higher dipole in 2 enables a much more facile re-orientation of amide dipoles in the hinge region and contributes to the stability of the re-organized peptide backbone resulting in higher binding affinity. The considerations outlined above, in part, led to design of

2-pyridazinone based inhibitors.11 It is expected that 2pyridinones and 4-pyridinones can also be used similarly.11 The choice of a 2-chlorophenyl or 2,6-dichlorophenyl group as the substituent that is expected to occupy hydrophobic pocket 2 was based on prior SAR history.8 The synthesis of pyridazine-based scaffold is shown in Scheme 1. Thus, condensation of maleic anhydride with 2-chlorophenyl hydrazine gave hydroxy pyridazinone derivative 10 which was treated with phosphorus oxychloride at reflux to furnish the chloro derivative 11. Displacement of the chloride was expected to provide an avenue to explore the requirement of a suitable tether carrying the hydrophobic substituent. Other analogs were synthesized in a similar fashion. Several approaches to gain access of the hydrophobic pocket-1 were explored. Biaryls such as 14a and 14b did not inhibit the kinases (no activity at 20 lM). One-atom tethers such as aryl amines, aryl sulfides and aryl ethers gave promising results (Table 1). Aryl amines 15, 17, and 18 register IC50s in the half-micromolar range. Small alkyl groups, chlorine, and fluorines were tolerated, while larger substituents such as methoxy and phenyl groups

were clearly detrimental. Aryl sulfide 20 inhibited both isoforms of p38 (a and b) with an IC50 140 and 450 nM, respectively. Aryl sulfides with a chlorine substitution in the para position (22) is sixfold less potent than corresponding fluorine analog. It was surprising that none of the aryl ethers (23 and 24) displayed any p38 inhibitory activity even though comparable aryl amines were potent. It is thought that the inherent lack of rotational bias and physical inability to access the hydrophobic pocket might contribute to its lack of activity. Two-atom tethers (25 and 26) were sub-optimal. Based on modeling aryl amine 15 and aryl sulfide 20 within the active site of p38, it was observed that the glycine-rich loop does not interact with the inhibitor. It was also conceived that elaboration under this loop will pre-orient the aryl substituent for facile entry into the hydrophobic pocket-1. Making contact with Asp° 168 situated 6­9 A from the one-atom tether affords another opportunity to enhance potency by means of a salt bridge (Scheme 2). Aryl amine 15 provided a convenient starting point for exploring these ideas. The phthalimide derivative 30 with a 3-carbon linker was found to be surprisingly potent against both p38-a and p38-b. Corresponding 2C linker was not optimal. Unravelling the phthalimide yielded 28 with a concomitant drop-off in potency. The phthalimide moeity is thought to be involved in a p­p stacking interaction with tyrosine residue-35 on the G-rich loop. Figure 3 represents an X-ray crystal structure section of the complex between unactivated p38 and 30.12 The G-rich loop is highlighted in green color. The face-to-face interaction made by the pendant Tyr-35 in the G-rich loop with the phthalimide moiety

of 30 is obvious. The lack of potency for the corresponding 2C linker can be explained due to its inability to access a favorable stacking interaction that the 3C analog 30 is able to achieve. It can also be speculated that mere occupation of the space under the G-rich loop is sufficient to pre-orient the 2-chlorophenyl substituent for facile access into the hydrophobic pocket thus leading to higher potencies.

Thus, analysis of the binding modes of various p38 inhibitors has enabled the design of novel, potent, and selective p38 inhibitors based on a 2-aryl pyridazinone scaffold. Investigations to optimize pharmacokinetic profiles and functional activities are currently ongoing and are expected to yield compounds of clinical importance.

Due to the comparable potency of 28 with a 2C hydroxy analog 27, it was assumed that the amine is not positioned to make a salt bridge with the proximal aspartic acid residue-168. In order to explore the facility of establishing this salt bridge amide analogs 32­35 were synthesized. Most of these compounds inhibited both isoforms of p38 with potency in the low nanomolar range. It is believed that the high potency displayed by these compounds primarily arises from their ability to occupy the space under the G-rich loop rather than through a salt bridge as the original intent for which they were designed for. The equipotency of designed analog 36, which cannot form a salt bridge with proximal Asp168, lends credence to the suggestion made above. It was also encouraging to note that analogs in Table 2 did not show any significant activity (no inh. at 10 lM) when screened against an extensive panel of known kinases particularly p38-c, p38-d, JNKs, and ERKs.
