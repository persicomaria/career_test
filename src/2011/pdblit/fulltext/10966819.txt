Comparison of the three-dimensional structures of folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) and the bacterial cell wall ligase UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate ligase (MurD) reveals that these two enzymes have a remarkable structural similarity despite a low level of sequence identity. Both enzymes have a modular, multi-domain structure and catalyse a similar ATP-dependent reaction involving the addition of a glutamate residue to a carboxylate-containing substrate, tetrahydrofolate in the case of FPGS, and UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine in the case of MurD. Site-directed mutations of selected residues in the active site of Lactobacillus casei FPGS (P74A, E143A, E143D, E143Q, K185A, D313A, H316A, G411A and S412A) showed that most of these changes resulted in an almost complete loss of activity. Several of these amino acid residues in FPGS are found in structurally equivalent positions to active-site residues in MurD. Some insights into the function of these residues in FPGS activity are proposed, based on the roles surmised from the structures of two MurD ÁUDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine ÁADP complexes and a MurD ÁUDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine-D-glutamate complex. Furthermore, the comparison has led us to propose that conformational changes induced by substrate binding in the reaction mechanism of FPGS result in a movement of the domains towards each other to more closely resemble the orientation of the corresponding domains in MurD. This relative domain movement may be a key feature of this new family of ADP-forming amide bond ligases.

Introduction
The ATP-dependent amide bond ligase superfamily contains over 50 enzymes involved in the synthesis of compounds including asparagine and glutamine, glutathione, bacterial cell wall components, polyglutamylated folates and biotinylated enzymes (Appel et al., 1994). While the products of these enzymes vary widely, the enzymes themselves possess common features, in that they all require three substrates, i.e. ATP, a carboxylatecontaining compound, and a third with a free amino group. A new amide bond is formed between the two latter substrates following activation of the carboxylate group by ATP. The ligases are divided into two distinct subgroups

428 depending upon the mode of ATP activation. In one subgroup, activation involves the formation of adenylate-substrate intermediates, ultimately leading to the formation of AMP, while in the other subgroup, ADP is produced following the phosphorylation of the carboxylate group. In the latter case, transfer of the g-phosphoryl group from ATP gives an acyl-phosphate intermediate. Although there is little sequence identity among the amide bond ligases, some structural similarities have been noted. A common feature of some of these enzymes, including adenylosuccinate synthetase (Poland & Honzantko, 1993), dethiobiotin synthetase (Alexeev et al., 1994), UDP-N-acetylmurligase (MurD; amoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate Bertrand et al., 1997) and folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS; Sun et al., 1998), is the presence of a phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) similar to that seen in a number of mononucleotide-binding enzymes (Saraste et al., 1990; Smith & Rayment, 1996). In another study it was found that the threedimensional structures of D-alanyl:D-alanine ligase, glutathione synthetase and biotin carboxylase (Artymiuk et al., 1996; Fan et al., 1995) share a strong structural homology, suggesting an evolutionary relationship. The possibility of a structural and functional relationship between FPGS and the murein ligases has also been raised (Bouhss et al., 1997; Eveland et al., 1997), based upon sequence similarity, although until recently, the only structure available was that of MurD (Bertrand et al., 1997). MurD is an ATP-dependent enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (Bertrand et al., 1997). MurD is one of four ADP-forming murein ligases involved in the sequential addition of the components of the pentapeptide segment to UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid (Figure 1(a)). Not surprisingly, all four murein ligases (MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF) have regions of high sequence identity and may employ a similar catalytic mechanism involving an acyl phosphate intermediate (Figure 1(c); Vaganay et al., 1996). Recent structural studies on Escherichia coli MurD (Bertrand et al., 1997, 1999) show that it consists of three domains (Figure 2(a)). Domain 1 (residues 1 to 93) has a Rossmann-like fold and is involved in the binding of the UDP moiety of the UDP-N-acetylmuramoylL-alanine (UMA) substrate. Domain 2 has a typical mononucleotide-binding fold (Schulz, 1993; Smith & Rayment, 1996), and is responsible for the binding of ATP. The two recent ADP-bound MurD structures (Bertrand et al., 1999) show that the nucleotide is bound to a P-loop motif, with the aphosphate group located at the N terminus of helix a6. Two magnesium ions are associated with the binding of the UMA and ADP, the ®rst (Mg1) located between the UMA and His183, and the second (Mg2) bound in the ``classical'' mononucleotide cation binding pocket where it interacts with the b-phosphate group of the ADP, Ser116 from the P-loop and Glu157 strand b8. Domain 3,

also having a Rossmann-like fold (Bertrand et al., 1997), appears to be involved in the binding of the D-glutamate (Bertrand et al., 1999). We recently determined the crystal structure of Ê FPGS from Lactobacillus casei to 2.4 A resolution (Sun et al., 1998). FPGS is an ADP-forming enzyme from eukaryotic and bacterial sources that catalyses the addition of L-glutamate residues to tetrahydrofolate (Figure 1(b)) to produce folylpolyglutamates (McGuire & Coward, 1984; Shane, 1989). Folylpolyglutamates are required for effective intracellular retention of folate, and are the preferred substrates for the enzymes of one-carbon metabolism. The reaction catalyzed by FPGS also proceeds via an acyl phosphate intermediate (Bannerjee et al., 1988) and a tetrahedral g-carbon intermediate (Figure 1(c)), and potent phosphapeptide inhibitors of the human enzyme have been developed based upon the latter (Tsukamoto et al.,

The location of the UMA and ADP substrates are shown as coloured sticks, and the two magnesium ions as orange balls. In FPGS, the N-terminal domain is shown in blue and the Cterminal domain in red. The region coloured green corresponds to the 50-residue insertion (see the text). The -loop is shown in cyan, while the pink and magenta loops represent the loops between 146-150 and 170-176 which are missing in the FPGS ÁATP Á Mg2 structure. These have been modelled in the Figure as they appear in an apoFPGS structure (unpublished results). Two loops in the C-terminal domain (the B12-A10 loop and the B16-A13 loop) are coloured orange. The location of the residues listed in Table 3, along with additional amino acid residues mutated here, are indicated by their residue number in (b). The P-loop is shown in grey and the approximate location of the active site is indicated for both structures.

1998). The crystal structure of the MgATP complex of FPGS (FPGS ÁATP ÁMg2; Figure 2(b)) reveals that the enzyme has a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal mononucleotide-binding domain, and a C-terminal domain with a fold similar to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The active site is located in a cleft between the N and C domains, and two of the phosphate groups have been modelled as a pyrophosphate molecule. Remarkably, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of FPGS bear a striking similarity to domains 2 and 3 of MurD, although the relative domain orientations differ. Here we have carried out a detailed comparison of the FPGS and MurD structures. Prior to this structural comparison, mutagenesis studies of selected residues in L. casei FPGS had been undertaken in order to ascertain their roles in the function of the P-loop, the -loop and surrounding parts of the active site. These results have now been examined in light of the comparison with MurD. The comparison has also led us to propose an important role for domain movements in the reaction mechanisms of both enzymes that may explain the signi®cant conformational changes that have been associated with the reaction mechanism of FPGS (Cichowicz & Shane, 1987; Shane, 1989).

Results
FPGS mutants Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on conserved residues which had been highlighted as being functionally important based upon the FPGS ÁATP ÁMg2 structure (Sun et al., 1998). The residues were divided into (i) those located in a distinctive loop near the active site, (ii) those thought to be involved in binding the ATP and Mg2, and (iii) others from the C-terminal domain which were possibly involved in folate or L-glutamate binding (Table 1 and Figure 2). The ®rst group of residues were located in a highly conserved -loop, residues 73 to 82, a feature unique to FPGS. A cis-Pro residue at the start of the loop helps shape the active site. The majority of the residues in the -loop are conserved in the FPGS sequences known to date, including the Ser73Pro74 motif at the start, an aromatic residue (Phe75 in the L. casei enzyme), a small hydrophobic residue (Ile76 in L. casei), a second aromatic residue (Phe79), a highly conserved glutamate (Glu81), and an arginine residue at the end of the loop (Arg82). Mutation of Ser73, Glu81 and Arg82 to alanine resulted in 20 to 35-fold decreases in enzyme

less than 1 % of wild-type activity (Table 1). The recent structural studies on MurD point to a role for the equivalent residue in the binding of the terminal carboxylate moiety of UMA substrate, and possibly in phosphoryl transfer to form the acyl phosphate intermediate (Bertrand et al., 1999). The mutations in the C-terminal domain gave essentially inactive enzymes (although the S412A mutant had some residual activity at 2 % of wildtype). While it is not possible in the case of the D313A, H316A and G411A mutants to ascertain which of the three substrates is affected, the S412A mutant has only minor changes in Km for ATP and folate and a 60-fold increase in Km for glutamate (Table 2), implicating the loop in which this residue is located (between strand B16 and helix A13) in glutamate binding. The loss of conformational ¯exibility following the G411A mutation could result in a different structure of this loop, which might disrupt substrate binding. Sequence alignments Automated alignment of the amino acid sequences of L. casei FPGS and domains 2 and 3 of E. coli MurD gave a sequence identity of 17 % (73 matching pairs out of 428 residues in FPGS) and a similarity (identical residues  similar residues) of 36 %. However, the sequence alignment bore little resemblance to the structural alignment, apart from a 44-residue region at the beginning of the N domain of FPGS (residues 29 to 73) which matched with residues 94 to 138 at the N terminus of domain 2 of MurD. In FPGS, following residue 73, there is an insertion of 50 residues before the two structures come back into register at residue 124 (139 in MurD). From this point there are only minor insertions and deletions in the two structures. The two sequences were subsequently aligned manually, based upon the superposition of the two structures. Surprisingly, the sequence identity decreased to 13 % (56 identical pairs), although the number of similar residues increased (23 %, 98 pairs) and the overall sequence similarity was about the same at 36 %. Despite the decrease in sequence identity, a number of highly conserved motifs were identi®ed, as indicated in the structure-based sequence alignment (Figure 3).

activity, while the P74A mutation completely abolished enzyme activity (Table 1). Glu81 and Arg82 are involved in stabilizing the loop, the side-chain of the glutamate residue forming hydrogen bonding interactions across to the main-chain of residues Phe75 and Ile76, while the arginine side-chain links the two ends of the loop by hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Thr72. The S73A, E81A and R82A mutants all have elevated KM values for the folate substrate, while the KM values for the other substrates are not greatly affected (Table 2). Two other residues near the active site were mutated to alanine. Glu143 is a potential ligand for the essential Mg2 associated with ATP hydrolysis (Sun et al., 1998), and mutation to alanine, glutamine or aspartate results in an inactive enzyme (Table 1). Mutagenesis of the equivalent residues in MurC (Glu174), MurD (Glu157) and MurF (Glu158) also leads to enzyme inactivation (Bouhss et al., 1997, 1999; Eveland et al., 1997), although in the case of a MurF E158D mutant there was some residual activity. Mutation of Lys185 of FPGS (conserved in all FPGS and murein ligase sequences) to alanine results in a sevenfold increase in the Km for folate and an 11-fold increase in the Km for L-glutamate (Table 2), with the mutant enzyme retaining

The structure-based sequence alignment of L. casei FPGS (residues 29 to 428) and E. coli MurD (residues 94 to 437), with the secondary structure elements for both enzymes given above and below. The extra residues in the FPGS sequence between 73 and 124 represent the 50-residue insertion not present in MurD (see the text). Some regions of a high level of sequence identity are shown in grey boxes. The four conserved regions (labelled I to IV) identi®ed by Eveland et al. (1997) and Bouhss et al. (1997) are also shown for the MurD sequence.

432 Structural comparison Topology diagrams for the N and C domains of FPGS and domains 2 and 3 of MurD are shown in Figure 4 (domain 1 of MurD does not correspond to any part of the FPGS structure and has been excluded from the comparison). The two enzymes have essentially the same spatial arrangement of their secondary structural elements, despite the low sequence identity. Domain 2 of MurD contains almost all of the secondary structural elements found in the N domain of FPGS. The one major difference is at the site of the 50-residue insertion. In MurD, strand b7 leads straight into helix a7, whereas in FPGS the equivalent secondary structure elements, strand B2 and helix A5, are separated by the ten-residue -loop, and an additional b-strand (B3) and helix (A4). The N domain of FPGS (Sun et al., 1998) and domain 2 of MurD (Bertrand et al., 1997) contain the structural elements of a classical mononucleotide-binding domain, as found in the ras-like enzymes (Schulz, 1993; Smith & Rayment, 1996). The common core structure of these enzymes consists of a central four-stranded b-sheet, ¯anked by four invariant a-helices, which has been referred to

as the ras-like domain (Coleman et al., 1994). Superposition of the N domain of FPGS onto domain 2 of MurD (Figure 5(a)) gives a root-mean-square Ê deviation (rmsd) of 0.7 A for 72 matching Ca Ê atoms, compared to 1.7 A (57 Ca) with myosin and Ê 1.9 A (55 Ca) with ras-p21. It is clear that the N domain of FPGS is more similar to domain 2 of MurD than to the other ras-like enzymes. Domain 3 of MurD has the same topology as the C domain in FPGS, except for one additional helix a14 (Figure 4(d)). In FPGS, this region of the structure (between strands B14 and B15) is disordered. The FPGS C domain has been likened to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), in that the spatial arrangement of the secondary structure elements is very similar. Superposition of this domain onto Ê human DHFR gave a rmsd of 1.6 A for 52 Ca atoms (Sun et al., 1998). All secondary structure elements in the C domain of FPGS (strands B11 to B16 and helices A10 to A13, see Figure 4(b)) can be superimposed on to equivalent elements in domain Ê 3 of MurD with a rmsd of 2.0 A (69 Ca; Ê Figure 5(b)). The rmsd drops to 1.2 A (49 Ca) when two mismatched helices, A11 and A13, are excluded from the superposition. Not surprisingly, domain 3 of MurD also has a high structural simi-

Ê larity with DHFR, with a rmsd of 1.2 A (37 Ca, with helix a16 in MurD excluded). A signi®cant difference exists in the relative orientations of the ras-like (FPGS N domain and MurD domain 2) and DHFR-like (FPGS C domain and MurD domain 3) domains in the two proteins. Superposition of all equivalent elements in FPGS Ê and MurD (121 Ca atoms) gives a rmsd of 2.2 A, signi®cantly greater than the individual differences between the ras-like domains, and between the DHFR-like domains. This is a result of the different relative orientations of the two domains; in MurD, the domains are rotated closer together than in FPGS by approximately 20  . The active site In addition to the overall topological and structural similarity, some residues which are highly conserved in both FPGS and MurD families are found at the same positions, particularly in the active site (Table 3). The P-loops for both FPGS (residues 46 to 52, sequence GTNGKGS) and MurD (residues 111 to 117, sequence GSNGKSS) Ê are identical in conformation (rmsd  0.31 A for 28 equivalent main chain atoms) and are located in the same position, within a deep cleft formed

between the ras-like and the DHFR-like domains (Figure 2). The P-loops in FPGS and MurD are examples of a novel kind of shortened loop with a ``deletion'' of two residues between the invariant ®rst Gly and the Gly-Lys (bold type in the sequences above), compared with the ``classical'' Ploop which has four variable residues between these two glycine residues (GxxxxGKT/S). The two-residue ``deletion'' leads to a difference in conformation of the P-loop in FPGS and MurD compared to the classical P-loop, in that it forms a rather sharp turn between the b-strand and a-helix. Figure 6 shows the FPGS and MurD P-loops superimposed onto the P-loop of ras P21. An acidic residue (Glu143) from the b-strand (B4) adjacent to the P-loop is believed to coordinate to the Mg2 in FPGS (Sun et al., 1998). In MurD the equivalent residue is Glu157 which contributes to the coordination sphere of one of the magnesium ions (Mg2) observed in MurD ÁUMA ÁADP Á Mg2 (Bertrand et al., 1999; Figure 6). This glutamate residue is conserved in both the FPGS and murein ligase families, indicative of a similar divalent cation binding role in these proteins. A carboxylate residue (usually aspartate) is an important feature of the active site of the ras-like domain of other nucleotide-binding enzymes. In most cases it is

hydrogen bonded to one of the solvent molecules coordinated to the Mg2 (Smith & Rayment, 1996). The loop between strand B12 and helix A10 (b16-a12 in MurD) appears to be an important region in the two structures. Superposition of the C domain of FPGS onto domain 3 of MurD brings this loop into the same position, and shows that they have a similar conformation (Figure 7(b)). The loop contains residues conserved throughout the murein ligase family, along with residues conserved in all MurD orthologs but not well conserved between the other ligases. Two residues from this loop are important with respect to the activity of MurD. The side-chain of Asp317 is hydrogen bonded to the O3H atom of the ribose group and the O4H atom via a water molecule, while Thr321 interacts with the a-carboxylate group of the D-glutamate residue and is part of the proposed D-glutamate binding site (Bertrand et al., 1999). In FPGS, the aspartate residue is conserved (Asp313), while His316 is in an equivalent position to Thr321 in MurD (Figure 7). Both residues are part of a highly conserved motif in the FPGS enzymes with consensus sequence DxAH. Other residues implicated in the binding of the D-glutamate substrate in MurD are associated with loops between strand b20 and helix a16 (Ser415 and Phe422), and strand b17 and helix a13 (Lys348; Table 3), which are located close to each other facing into the interdomain cleft (Figure 7(a)). The Nz atom of Lys348 is hydrogen bonded to the a-carboxyl group of the D-glutamate in MurD, while the g-carboxyl group is held in place by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the mainchain atoms of Ser415 and Phe422, and to the Og atom of Ser415 (Bertrand et al., 1999). The structural alignment between MurD and FPGS in this region is not quite as clear as in other parts of the structure. There is an insertion of six or seven residues in MurD between strand b20 and helix a16,

which puts this helix in a different orientation relative to the corresponding helix (A13) in FPGS. This can be clearly seen in the superposition of the DHFR-like domains of FPGS and MurD (Figure 5(b)).

Discussion
Regions of high sequence similarity Despite the limited sequence identity between FPGS and MurD, the striking similarities in topology and structure suggest that FPGS and MurD may carry out their biological functions in a similar way. A relationship between these two enzymes, based upon the identi®cation of regions of high sequence similarity, was proposed by two groups prior to the crystal structure reports (Bouhss et al., 1997; Eveland et al., 1997). It was subsequently shown in the crystal structures of MurD that the majority of the conserved residues in these regions were functionally important (Bertrand et al., 1997, 1999), and recent mutagenesis studies on a number of these residues show that they all have reduced enzyme activity (Bouhss et al., 1999). Although only four regions of the murein ligase and FPGS proteins were aligned, the degree to which these alignments match with the structural alignment is quite remarkable. Regions I, II and IV surround the active site and contain residues important for the enzyme activity (Figures 3 and 4). Region III is on the opposite side of the ras-like domain and residues in this region are unlikely to play a signi®cant role in activity. It is no surprise that there is a high level of similarity in the P-loops of both enzymes (Figures 3 and 4). Clearly the ``short'' loop observed in FPGS and MurD retains the primary function attributed to the classical P-loop; the binding of the triphosphate moiety of the ATP (Figures 6 and 7(a)) via

In MurD, this lysine residue (Lys115) interacts with the a and b phosphate groups, and it is suggested that it may play a role in stabilizing the acyl phosphate intermediate (Bertrand et al., 1999). It has been shown that the equivalent residue in FPGS (Lys50) plays an important role in catalysis but does not affect the binding of ATP or the other two substrates (Toy & Bognar, 1994). A similar result is observed with a K115A MurD mutant (Bouhss et al., 1999) where the Kcat is less than 0.1 % of wild-type, whereas the Km values for the three substrates show only small increases. One important difference between the two P-loops is the residue that follows the lysine. In FPGS this is a glycine (Gly51), while in MurD it is a serine (Ser116), which forms part of the Mg2 binding site along with Glu157 (Figure 6). There is a conserved hydroxyl residue following Gly51 in FPGS but it is not in a position to interact with the Mg2. Instead the carbonyl oxygen atom of Ser73 from the loop is coordinated to the Mg2, in addition to Glu143 (Figure 6). Despite this difference, it is thought that this ``short'' P-loop might represent a unique divergence from an ancient nucleotidebinding motif. Strands B4 and B5, and helix A6 in FPGS (Figures 3 and 4) form the equivalent of conserved region II in MurD (strand b8, helix a8, strand b9 and helix a9). Conserved residues in this region of MurD include the histidine involved in UMA binding (His183), the glutamate at the end of strand b8 (Glu157) which contributes to the Mg2 site, and a carbamylated lysine residue (Lys198) involved in the Mg1 binding site (Figure 7(a)). This lysine is of particular interest in that it is completely lacking in the MurC enzymes (where this residue is either alanine or phenylalanine). Mutation of Lys198 to

either alanine or phenylalanine abolishes enzyme activity and increases the KM for UMA almost 30fold (Bouhss et al., 1999). It has been suggested that this may re¯ect the nature of the carboxylate substrate, in that UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid does not contain an amide linkage, while the substrates for ligases which have a lysine at this position (MurD, MurE, MurF and FPGS) do. If this residue is important for the formation of the Mg1 site, then it is possible that this site may not exist in MurC, despite the expected similarity in their reaction mechanisms (Bertrand et al., 1999). FPGS has a lysine residue in an identical location (Lys185) in a region which is itself highly conserved (consensus sequence xKxGIxK). The location of Lys185 (shown in bold type) near the active site (Figure 7(a)) implies that it may also be involved in the formation of a second metal-binding site or in catalysis. The mutagenesis data also support this, with a 130-fold decrease in activity following mutation of Lys185 to alanine (Table 1), and increases in Km for both folate and L-glutamate (Table 2). Con®rmation of a second cation site must await further structural studies on FPGS complexes. The interdomain linker peptide corresponds to the latter part of conserved region IV (Figure 3), along with residues involved in the adenine-binding pocket of MurD. Although the majority of the residues in this region are not strictly conserved in FPGS, there is always an asparagine residue (Asn264) in a position equivalent to the second of two conserved asparagine residues in the murein ligases (Asn296 in MurC and Asn271 in MurD), and an arginine residue at the C-terminal end of the interdomain linker (Arg300 in FPGS, Arg327 in MurC and Arg302 in MurD; Figures 3 and 7(a)). This last residue interacts with the a-phosphate group of the ADP in MurD ÁUMA Á ADP ÁMg2, and

The Ca traces for FPGS and MurD are shown in black and grey, with the side-chains in blue and red, respectively. The pyrophosphate group and Mg2 are shown in magenta for FPGS, while the ADP and Mg2 are in orange and green for MurD. Residues which are common to both FPGS and MurD are labelled in black using the FPGS numbering scheme (see Table 3 for the equivalent residue numbers in MurD). Residues which are different in the two structures are indicated with blue labels for FPGS and red labels for MurD.

the pyrophosphate group in FPGS ÁATP Á Mg2, while the conserved asparagine residue is important in anchoring the adenine moiety by hydrogen bonding to the N6 atom (Bertrand et al., 1999). It is expected that the asparagine and arginine residues will play similar roles in FPGS. Substrate binding While the remarkably similar multi-domain architecture of the two enzymes is perhaps not surprising given the similarity in their reaction mechanisms, it raises some important questions with regard to substrate binding. It is clear from both structures that the ras-like domain is responsible for ATP binding. In addition, the MurD structures show that the carboxylate substrate (UMA) is accommodated at the edge of the ras-like domain, associated with a domain which is unique to MurD (domain 1). The role of the DHFR-like domain remains a mystery. Tetrahydrofolate was tentatively modelled into this domain of FPGS, sandwiched between the central b-sheet and two a-helices (A10 and A11; Sun et al., 1998) in a similar manner to the way human DHFR binds dihydrofolate (Bolin et al., 1982; Davies et al., 1990). The

MurD ÁUMAG structure, however, suggests that the DHFR-like domain is likely to be involved in the binding of the D-glutamate, although de®nitive evidence must await a glutamate-bound complex of either MurD or FPGS. The most likely binding site for tetrahydrofolate in FPGS now appears to be near the loop, perhaps interacting also with the nearby 50-residue insertion. This substructure corresponds closely with the position of domain 1 in MurD (Figure 2). The glutamate residue could be associated with the B12-A10 and B16-A13 loops as suggested by the mutagenesis data (similar to the putative glutamate site in MurD). Given that the region encompassing the -loop and 50-residue insertion is the only place in which the FPGS and MurD structures differ to any extent, and that they occupy spatially similar positions, it would make sense that the UMA or tetrahydrofolate are accommodated in this variable part, while the substrates they have in common (ATP and glutamate) are bound by regions which have a similar structure (the raslike and the DHFR-like domains respectively). One critical point which must be kept in mind, however, is that while the mechanism of action of

437 of the DHFR-like domains (Figure 8), re¯ecting the insertion of one additional residue (Thr297) in the interdomain linker of MurD. The UMA and UMAG complexes of MurD could represent the structure of the enzyme following a substrateinduced conformational change, and substrate-free MurD could have an open structure similar to FPGS ÁATP ÁMg2. The structure of MurD in the absence of UMA has not been determined, so a substrate-induced conformational change in the linker between domain 2 and domain 3 of this enzyme has yet to be observed. A movement of the DHFR-like domain of FPGS to an orientation similar to that observed for MurD would bring this domain closer to the active site, such that the B12-A10 loop would be, on average, Ê 2.3 A closer to the active site. Helix A10 moves Ê approximately 2.5 A towards the N domain, and the B17-A13 loop (including residues Gly411, Ê Ser412 and Leu413) moves by about 1.5 A (Figure 9). The side-chain of His316 (part of the DXAH motif with Asp313) is brought closer to the active site where it could interact with one or more of the substrates. Since both the D313A and H316A mutants of FPGS have no activity, it is not possible to determine which substrate is affected. However, mutagenesis studies with human FPGS (Sanghani et al., 1999) showed that mutation of the aspartate residue (Asp335 in the human enzyme) gave rise to large increases in the Km values for all three substrates, suggesting a key role for this residue. Mutation of Asp317 in MurD results in an almost 40-fold increase in the Km for ATP (Bouhss et al., 1999), consistent with the structural studies which show that this residue is involved in anchoring the

the two families of enzymes might be similar, each of the murein ligases binds only one speci®c substrate with a particular polypeptide tail, catalyzes the addition of a speci®c amino acid, and releases the product into the cytoplasm to be bound by the next ligase, or incorporated into the cell wall in the case of MurF. While a given murein ligase does not have to accommodate a ``growing'' peptide chain as does FPGS, each successive enzyme in the series must bind a larger peptidoglycan substrate than its predecessor in such a way as to always present the terminal carboxylate group to the gphosphate group of the ATP. A hinged movement of the DHFR-like domain seems an obvious means whereby these enzymes could distinguish their own speci®c peptidoglycan substrate. Conformational change Equilibrium dialysis studies with the E. coli FPGS show that the binding af®nity of the enzyme for ATP increases signi®cantly when dihydropteroate is present, suggesting that binding of pteroate induces a conformational change which shifts the ATP from a ``weak'' binding to a ``strong'' binding mode (Y. Sheng and A.L.B., unpublished results). Comparison of the FPGS and MurD structures suggests that relative domain movements may be involved in this conformational change. When the ras-like domains of FPGS and MurD are superimposed, the DHFR-like domains can be brought into coincidence by changing the main-chain torsion angles (c, f) of residues His296 and Trp297. A Ê small translation (of about 1 A) of the C domain of FPGS is also required for complete superposition

The interdomain linker (His296-Leu301) is shown in red, and three secondary structure elements in the C domain (strands B11 and B12, and helix A10) are shown in light blue. After rotation of the C-terminal domain of FPGS to an orientation Ê similar to that of domain 3 of MurD (without the 1 A translation necessary to get complete coincidence of the domains), the linker position is shown in green and the rotated C-terminal domain structural elements in yellow. The side-chains have been omitted from this ``post-rotational'' conformation for clarity. This Figure was prepared using the program MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

ribose moiety of the nucleotide. Mutation of the histidine residue in human FPGS (His338) gave a 600-fold increase in the Km for L-glutamate, strongly supporting a role for this residue in glutamate binding. Given the wide variety of different residue types seen in this position in the FPGS and murein ligase families, and the observation that there is a degree of conservation in the orthologous ligases, this residue might play a role in selectivity for a particular amino acid substrate. A new ligase family When the similarities between DD-ligase and GSHase were ®rst noted, it was suggested that their structural relationship might re¯ect their common function; the synthesis of dipeptides by the ATP-activated coupling of two amino acids (Fan et al., 1995), and that this fold might be representative of the majority of the ADP-forming ligases. The realization that the ®rst 300 or so residues of biotin carboxylase also showed a structural resemblance to DD-ligase and GSHase extended the boundaries of this family and united the peptide bond ligases with the biotin-dependent carboxylase superfamily (Artymiuk et al., 1996). However this fold, consisting of three domains (N-terminal, central and C-terminal) each formed around a central b-sheet with the active site located between the central and C-terminal domains, is clearly distinct

from the common fold observed in FPGS and MurD; these two enzymes thus form a novel ADPforming amide bond ligase family. The appearance of several different enzyme folds which catalyse the same reaction is not new in biology. For example, a range of different protease families are known (the serine, cysteine and aspartic proteases, and the metalloproteases), all of which catalyse a similar reaction yet involve different residues in their active sites, and have very different structures. In the case of the ADP-forming ligases, it is now clear that there are at least two different structural families. The GSHase-like fold might be the framework for a family of ligases which catalyse a single ligation of an amino compound to an activated carboxylate group, whereas the FPGS/MurD family might have evolved to catalyse a more specialised reaction in which several amino substrates are added consecutively to a carboxylate compound. The striking similarity of these two structures suggests that they may have diverged from a common ancestor, but just what that ancestral enzyme might have been is dif®cult to ascertain. It is widely accepted that eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea have evolved from a common ancestor, and that this ancestor did not have a rigid cell wall (Kandler, 1982). Bacteria developed a common peptidoglycan succulus after splitting from this origin, while the eukaryotes and the archaea did not. While the archaea do have a cell envelope, it tends to vary in architecture and composition and only the methanobacteria and halobacteria have walls composed of a pseudomurein. It is unlikely that the FPGS enzymes, found in all living cells, would have evolved from a cell wall ligase, since these enzymes probably did not exist in the ancestral cell. A more likely possibility is that an ancient ras-like ATPase domain either recruited additional substrate-binding domains or developed additional binding sites, and began to function as a ligase. The modular structures of FPGS and MurD, along with the similarities observed between their ATPase domains and the ras-like domains of other nucleotide-binding domains, would seem to support this.

Materials and Methods
Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression and purification Site-directed mutagenesis was performed directly on the recombinant expression plasmid pCYB1 (New England Biolabs) encoding L. casei FPGS as fusion proteins with intein and chitin binding domains. Mutations were introduced by the oligonucleotide primer pairs using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis procedure of Stratagene, except that Expand-long PCR polymerase (BMH) was the polymerase used. The FPGS mutants were expressed and puri®ed with the IMPACT2 one-step puri®cation system (NEB). Each plasmid encoding a mutant protein was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 for expression. Cultures of the transformed cells were induced with 1 mM IPTG at

The eluted proteins were dialysed against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl and stored at À70  C with 20 % (w/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye-binding assay (BioRad). FPGS enzyme activity assay and analysis of kinetic data Enzyme activities were measured by the incorporation of [3H]glutamate into 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate as described (Shane, 1980). A standard L. casei FPGS assay mix consisted of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM glycine, 200 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 10 % (w/v) DMSO, 5 mM ATP, 250 mM L-glutamate, 1.25 mCi [3H]glutamate, 500 mM 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate, 12 mM formaldehyde and 5 to 10 mg of pure enzyme. Enzyme initial velocity data were analysed by hyperbolic regression analysis to determine the kinetic constants using the computer program HYPER (Version 1.0). Structural comparison The coordinates of the four E. coli MurD structures (MurD Á UMA, MurDÁ UMA Á ADPÁ Mg2, MurD ÁUMA Á ADP ÁMn2 and MurDÁ UMAG) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Bernstein et al., 1977), with accession numbers 1uag, 2uag, 3uag and 4uag respectively. The coordinates of the MgATP complex of the L. casei FPGS are also available in the PDB (1fgs). Automated sequence alignments were performed with the program ALIGN via the Baylor College of Medicine internet site (Smith et al., 1996). Structural superpositions were calculated with the program LSQKAB from the CCP4 suite of programs (Collaborative Computing Project 4, 1994). The models were displayed with the program TURBO (Roussel & Cambillau, 1991) on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation.
