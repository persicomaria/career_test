ABSTRACT: The structure of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase has been established at 1.35 Å resolution in a crystal form that was obtained by a surface mutation and has one subunit of the C4-symmetric tetramer in the asymmetric unit. It confirms an earlier 2.7 Å resolution structure which was determined in a complicated crystal form with 20 subunits per asymmetric unit. The chain fold and the active center are similar to those of L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase and L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase. The active center similarity is supported by a structural comparison of all three enzymes and by the binding mode of the inhibitor phosphoglycolohydroxamate at the site of the product dihydroxyacetone phosphate for the two aldolases. The sensitivity of the catalytic rate to several mutations and a comparison with the established mechanism of the related aldolase give rise to a putative catalytic mechanism. This mechanism involves the same binding mode of the second product L-lactaldehyde in both aldolases, except for a 180° flip of the aldehyde group distinguishing between the two epimers rhamnulose and fuculose. The N-terminal domain exhibits a correlated anisotropic mobility that channels the isotropic Brownian motion into a directed movement of the catalytic base and the substrate phosphate on the N-domain toward the zinc ion and the lactaldehyde on the C-terminal domain. We suggest that this movement supports the catalysis mechanically.

Aldolases are typical enzymes in metabolic pathways of sugars, amino acids, and hydroxy acids. They split into two classes with different reaction mechanisms. Class I aldolases activate the substrate by forming a Schiff base intermediate between a substrate carbonyl carbon and an essential lysine residue, whereas class II aldolases use a divalent metal ion as an electron sink for the aldol cleavage/addition reaction (1). Numerous structures of class I aldolases (2, 3) and five structures of class II aldolases (4-9) have been established. Most of them are homo-oligomers and contain a ( R)8-barrel as the common structural motif. The chain folds of the class II enzymes L-fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA,1 EC 4.1.2.17) and L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate aldolase (RhuA, EC 4.1.2.19), however, differ greatly from the others, showing an R/ -fold and assembling as a rare C4-symmetric tetramer. L-Ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase (RibE, EC 5.1.3.4) has been found to be structurally and functionally related to FucA and RhuA (4, 10-13). L-Rhamnose (6-deoxy-L-mannose) is a common component of various glycosides, polysaccharides, and glycoproThis project was supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft grant SFB-388.

teins in bacteria and plants. Its uptake and metabolism are performed by proteins encoded in the rhamnose regulon (14). Among them, RhuA catalyzes the cleavage of L-rhamnulose1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and L-lactaldehyde (Figure 1). In the reverse direction, this reaction can be used for carbon-carbon bond formation, creating two new stereo centers. Such enzyme-catalyzed reactions are attractive because they can be applied for the synthesis of chiral compounds (15-17). In the aldol addition reaction, RhuA accepts a wide range of aldehydes but is highly specific for DHAP (18). It is inhibited by phosphoglycolohydroxamate (PGH) which mimics DHAP (18, 19). RhuA is a homotetramer consisting of 274 amino acid residues with an Mr of 30 149 per subunit (9, 14, 20). Here we report its high-resolution structure and compare it with related enzymes. Moreover, we report the anisotropic mobility of the polypeptide revealed by the high-resolution crystal structure and the activity of several mutants which result in a proposal for the catalytic mechanism.

The second best solutions in molecular replacement are in brackets.

FIGURE 1: Reversible aldol cleavage/addition reactions catalyzed by RhuA, FucA, and RibE. The keto and hydroxyl groups at positions 2 and 3 of the educts L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate, L-fuculose-1-phosphate, and L-ribulose 5-phosphate are aligned because they bind to the Zn2+. The Zn2+ ions (/) are also aligned for the products. The phosphates bind at equivalent polypeptide sites. The two aldolases catalyze the same reaction except for using the respective 4-epimer. In our standard view, DHAP is "below" L-lactaldehyde. For RibE, the glycolaldehyde phosphate is below the dihydroxyacetone moiety and only the first reaction intermediate is shown. The RibE reaction proceeds by a 180° flip of the aldehyde group and a re-addition to yield the 4-epimer D-xylulose 5-phosphate.

A search in the Patterson range of 2-25 Å performed in the resolution range of 12-5 Å yielded a clear solution, which was subsequently subjected to a rigid-body refinement. The refinement was continued using REFMAC with the bulksolvent correction (24). Model adjustments were made with O (25). Water molecules were introduced using ARP (26). When the R-factor reached 20%, double conformations for several side chains, anisotropic B-factors, and hydrogen atoms were introduced (24). The refinement result was checked in a second anisotropic refinement using SHELX (27), which did not reveal discrepancies. The structure alignments were carried out using LSQMAN (28). The figures were produced with MOLSCRIPT (29) and RASTER3D (30). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Protein Structure. Crystals of the wild-type enzyme with their 20 crystallographically asymmetric subunits diffracted to only 2.7 Å resolution and were much too complex for a convenient analysis of structural modifications (9). For both reasons, we tried to obtain a more suitable crystal form by producing the six point mutants W8T, Q51R, Q52E, D98Y, E192A, and E254R at the protein surface far away from the active center (31). All of them yielded crystals, among which those of mutant E192A exhibited superior quality. Data were collected from one E192A crystal (Table 1). The phases were derived by molecular replacement using the model established with the wild-type crystals (9). The rotational and the following translational searches yielded a clear solution far above the second best solution (Table 1) which was then taken to be the starting position for the refinement. Because of the high resolution, every non-hydrogen protein atom was restrained by 33 observables (Table 2). Accordingly, the refinement was extended to anisotropic B-factors and 23 double side chain conformations. The resulting model was of high quality as the final R-factors were low and the backbone dihedral angles were concentrated in the most favorable regions (32). Only Arg28 at the tetramer interface near the active center was in a generously allowed region (32) as observed with the wild-type structure (9). The E192A structure resembled closely that of the wild type; the rmsd of the CR atoms was merely 0.4 Å. The deviations reached 1.4 Å at residue 52 which is located in packing contacts in both crystal forms (see below). The chain fold is depicted in Figure 2. A closer inspection revealed that the 5-R4-

or other methods (SeqLab, Gottingen, Germany). The ¨ enzyme was produced in Escherichia coli JM105 and purified as described previously (9). The enzyme activity was determined as with FucA (21) except for using L-rhamnulose1-phosphate instead of its fuculose epimer. Initial crystallization conditions for the mutants were found by screening (22). The E192A crystal used for data collection grew under condition 4 of Crystal Screen 2 (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) from an 18% (v/v) dioxane solution. A measurement showed a pH of 4.0. For data collection, 20% glycerol was added and the crystal was mounted on a loop and flash-frozen at 100 K. Under exactly defined conditions, it was only possible to reproduce the crystallization of E192A with a buffer of 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 3.0) and 35% (v/v) dioxane as the reservoir and a 1:1 mixture of this buffer with a 10 mg/mL enzyme solution as the hanging drop. Data Collection, Molecular Replacement, and Refinement. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K using beamline BW7B (EMBL Outstation, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with an image plate (Marresearch, model 345). Data were processed using MOSFLM (23), SCALA (23), and TRUNCATE (23). The phases were established by molecular replacement using one subunit of the wild-type model (PDB entry 1GT7) without water or PGH (9) with AMoRe (23).

Kroemer et al. on tetramerization which is 22% of the total surface and therefore in the usual range. The crystal packing contacts affecting residue sets C-F amount to 3920 Å2 per tetramer, which is 11% and also common. The E192A mutation concerns packing contact set C and was obviously essential for the new crystal form. Notably, half of the residues with double conformations were found in the artificial environment of crystal packing contacts. The packing of the wildtype crystals is much more complex, and only the recurring association into octamers is stated in Table 3. Structure Comparisons. For a long time, RhuA was thought to be closely related to FucA because the reactions differ only marginally (16). However, RhuA has 59 more amino acid residues than FucA, and sequence homology is only revealed if the key residues are taken into account. The similarity between FucA and RibE had been detected in a sequence search accompanying the structure analysis of FucA (4) and later analyzed in detail when the structure of RibE was established (12, 13). RibE catalyzes the 4-epimerization of a 2-ketose phosphate which differs chemically from the more common 3-epimerization (34) because it is not facilitated by an adjacent keto group (Figure 1). Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that this reaction runs through an aldol intermediate (10-13). Moreover, the structural comparison revealed related side chain ligands for Zn2+ and phosphate that constitute the two anchor points of substrate binding. A superposition of the three structurally known family members resulted in quite a number of large gaps (Figure 4). An evaluation showed that the subunits of RhuA and FucA can be superimposed on 136 CR atoms within the usual 3 Å cutoff (Table 4). When the tetramers were superimposed, this number dropped to 80 per subunit. The comparison between RhuA and RibE resulted in a lower level of similarity, indicating a more distant relationship than between the aldolases. Moreover, the superposition of FucA with RibE revealed a much closer relationship than between any one of them and RhuA. Within the family, the level of sequence identity in the structure-aligned part shows the same relationship as the chain folds (Table 4). Nine of the 15 conserved residues of Figure 4 outline the Zn2+ and phosphate sites. The other six residues exhibit varying degrees of conservation in a comparison of all known RhuA, FucA, and RibE sequences (data not shown), starting from the best conserved His121 via Glu232, Gly101, Ala235, and Leu208 to the least conserved Glu192. The five N-terminal insertions in RhuA enlargen the protrusion at the bottom end of Figure 2, indicating a great evolutionary distance. Moreover, the C-termini of FucA and RibE are disordered, while the respective residues after helix R10 of RhuA (Figure 4) are rigid. In both FucA and RibE, some of these disordered residues are important for the catalytic reaction (11-13, 19, 21), presumably because they cover and interact with the bound substrate (21, 35). Now in RhuA, we find that the corresponding residues cannot contribute directly to catalysis as they run away from the active center. Since they exhibit low B-factors and are identical in the two crystal forms and not in a packing contact, their location is most likely natural. Substrate Binding. The structure refinement resulted in three regions of clear residual density at the active center that could not be explained by water molecules (Figure 5A).

Double conformations were refined for 23 side chains (20 solventaccessible and three buried), 15 of which were lysines, glutamines, glutamates, and methionines. The ratios of the partial occupancies ranged between 1:4 and 1:1. b Occupancies are given in parentheses. c The distribution of the anisotropy values (Umax - Umin)/Umax approximates a Gaussian at 0.48 with a  of 0.13, thus validating the refinement procedure (38). Umin and Umax are the shortest and longest axes, respectively, of the displacement tensors describing the B-factor anisotropy. d Arg28 was in the generously allowed region (32) as in the wild-type structure (9).

6 connection is left-handed and that it splits the -sheet in two parts, 1- 5 and 6- 9. This is a typical topological switch dividing the subunit into two folding units or domains. Because of its intimate contacts, helix R4 was assigned to the C-terminal domain (residues 118-274). The N-domain (residues 1-117) harbors the phosphate binding site and the putative acid/base catalyst Glu117 (see below), whereas the C-domain provides the histidines accommodating the Zn2+ ion. The isotropic B-factor distribution in Figure 3 revealed a generally more mobile N-domain with an average of 15 Å2 (all protein atoms) compared to a value of 12 Å2 for the C-domain. A similar difference has been found for the respective domains of FucA (33) and RibE (12). This fits the observation that the C-domain forms the tetramer interface and the N-domain the large protrusion in these enzymes (Figure 2B). The obtained 1.35 Å resolution permitted an anisotropic B-factor refinement that revealed a further difference between the N- and C-domains as described in the legend of Figure 3. While the directions of the displacement ellipsoids of the C-domain were randomly distributed, those of the N-domain tended to be azimuthally ordered around the molecular 4-fold axis, indicating a rotational mobility around this axis. Such a rotational displacement pushed the N-domain with its acid/base catalyst Glu117 and substrate phosphate toward the Zn2+ ion and the lactaldehyde on the C-domain, supporting the reaction mechanically. We therefore suggest that the correlated anisotropic mobility converts the disordered thermal motion into a directed movement, facilitating catalysis. A RhuA subunit undergoes numerous contacts. Each of the four tetramer interfaces buries 1340 Å2 from each of residue sets A and B (Table 3). This adds up to 10720 Å2

One of the density regions was fitted by a fully occupied glycerol from the cryoprotection buffer. A second density region at the Zn2+ was interpreted as a superposition of 50% occupied dihydroxyacetone and 50% phosphate. Dihydroxyacetone was a 0.2% impurity in the cryoprotectant glycerol as shown by a spectrophotometric analysis. The phosphate

was from the last purification buffer and had escaped dialysis (9). Phosphates bound to Zn2+ have been found (36). The third density region is at the phosphate site and has been assigned to a 50% occupied phosphate and five water molecules associated with the remaining 50% of the molecules.

FIGURE 3: Polypeptide mobility of the 1.35 Å resolution E192A crystal structure represented by the isotropic B-factors of the CR atoms (s). The division between N- and C-domains is indicated by a vertical line. The averages in these two domains are 15 and 12 Å2, respectively. The B-factor distribution of the 2.7 Å resolution wild-type crystal structure shows peaks at the same position, but all values are 3 times higher. The scale at the right-hand side refers to the anisotropic B-factors of all CR atoms, which were converted to vectors in the direction of Umax with lengths (Umax Umin)/Umax, where Umax and Umin are the longest and shortest axes, respectively, of the anisotropic displacement tensors. These vectors were represented in cylindrical coordinates around the molecular 4-fold axis. Their azimuthal components, i.e., the rotational freedom around the molecular 4-fold axis, are displayed as a dotted line. Note that the vector length distribution approximates a Gaussian with an average of 0.48 and a standard deviation of 0.13 (Table 2) as commonly observed (38); therefore, the average length of each component is 0.48 × 3-1/2 (0.28), as indicated by a horizontal dotted line. A single component reaches a value of 0.48 if the vector points in its direction. Accordingly, the vector points predominantly along the azimuthal component in the N-domain but shows no directional preference in the C-domain. As a consequence, the anisotropic displacement of the N-domain corresponds to a rotational movement around the molecular 4-fold axis.

The bottom left triangle shows the percentage of identical residues in the structure-based alignment of Figure 4. The top right triangle gives the number of residues aligned in CR backbone comparisons using LSQMAN (28) with a 3 Å cutoff. The respective upper lines contain the residue numbers for the superposition of a single subunit, whereas the lower lines refer to superpositions of the tetramers. The resulting rmsd values are given in parentheses.

These interpretations explain the data well. They outline the phosphate site and the available space for a zinc ligand.

In a later structure analysis of an E192A crystal that had been grown from the phosphate buffer specified above, two phosphates at approximately full occupancy were observed: one at the phosphate site and the other at the Zn2+. The data were much lower in quality and therefore not further pursued. The electron density and the binding structure of PGH with wild-type RhuA are shown in Figure 5B. The split in the density distribution at the depicted high contour level indicates the predominance of the two anchor points at the Zn2+ and at the phosphate site, allowing motions in the region between them. A superposition of the E192A and wild-type crystal structures in Figure 5C showed displacements of Arg28 and Leu173 but almost no other changes. The analysis of FucA resulted in detailed proposals for the binding modes of L-fuculose-1-phosphate and for the reaction mechanism as it is sketched in Figure 1 (19, 21, 35). The aldol cleavage reactions of RhuA and FucA produce DHAP binding tightly to Zn2+ and the phosphate site (Figure 5B) and an L-lactaldehyde that finds no obvious anchor site, in agreement with the lower specificity for this moiety (16).

FIGURE 5: Stereoview of the active center of RhuA. (A) High-resolution E192A structure with the simulated annealed Fo - Fc difference density for the ligands at the 4.5 level (blue). The ligands are glycerol (100% occupied), dihydroxyacetone (50%), phosphate at Zn2+ (50%), phosphate (50%), and five water molecules at the phosphate site (50%) (Table 2). The high quality of the polypeptide structure is demonstrated by the final 2Fo - Fc electron density shown for two zinc-liganding histidines and a cysteine at the 3.3 level (orange). (B) Medium-resolution wild-type structure with PGH showing the simulated annealed Fo - Fc difference density at the 4.5 level. The density distribution is continuous at the 3.6 level. (C) Superposition of the E192A (dark gray) and wild-type (light gray) structures, where the only peptide differences occur at Arg28 and Leu173.

As a consequence, the bound aldehyde moiety had to be modeled in FucA (Figure 6A), and a similar modeling procedure is now required for RhuA. The superposition of the active centers of FucA and RhuA in Figure 6A shows a well-conserved PGH, revealing the binding mode of DHAP. In the aldol addition reaction, the DHAP 3-carbanion has to attack the si face of the aldehyde group in FucA or the re face of this group in RhuA (Figure 1). Since the F131A mutation of FucA, which provides space at the left-hand side of the aldehyde in Figure 6A, caused

the FucA mutant to produce the rhamnulose instead of the fuculose epimer from the nonpolar propion- and isobutyraldehydes (21), it was suggested that aldehyde binding to RhuA is related by a 180° rotation around the C4-O4 bond to the binding mode in FucA (see Figure 1). However, RhuA has no space at the left-hand side and cannot accommodate the O4 atom at the same position as in FucA as it contains no hydrogen bonding residue equivalent to Tyr113 of FucA. Therefore, we suggest that the aldehyde bound to RhuA differs from that in FucA by a 180° rotation around the C4-

C5 bond as it is sketched in Figure 1. This allows Glu117 to de- and reprotonate atoms O4 and C3, as performed by the equivalent Glu73 of FucA. Moreover, it brings the methyl group of the aldehyde into a hydrophobic environment that is outlined by the carbon backbone of the bound glycerol (Figure 6B). We conclude that the F131A mutation converting FucA into a RhuA for nonpolar aldehydes (21) resulted in a reaction geometry differing from that of natural RhuA. In contrast to FucA and RhuA, no substrate analogue could be bound to crystalline RibE, yet the Zn2+ position was clear and the phosphate site suggested by the homology with FucA (12, 13). These two anchors and the known effects of numerous mutants and isotopes on the activity suggested the reaction geometry sketched in Figure 1 (10-13). After C-C bond cleavage, the 4-epimerization involves a 180° rotation of the aldehyde group and a C-C re-addition to yield the 4-epimer. Asp120 and Tyr229 of RibE are likely to de- and reprotonate the O4 atom as suggested by the immense activity decrease on mutation (13). In contrast, Asp76 of RibE which aligns with catalyst Glu117 of RhuA (Figure 4) is of little importance (13). The binding model implies a strong fixation of the dihydroxyacetone at the Zn2+ and of the aldehyde at the phosphate site so that the split in the

The specific activity of the wild type was 20 units/ mg. The wild-type KM value was 0.48 mM. The differences between the activities and the kcat/KM values show that the KM values increased appreciably on mutation of substrate binding residues Arg28 and Asn29 (Figure 6B).

The substrate binding model of Figure 6B was compared with the kinetic data of several mutants given in Table 5. First of all, mutant E192A was indistinguishable from the wild type, confirming that this mutation affected only the crystallization and that its conservation (Figure 4) is a coincidence.

observed the C-terminal residues of RhuA in a fixed conformation away from the active center and away from any packing contact (Table 3), the disordered conformations and the importance of the equivalent parts of FucA (4, 21) and RibE (12, 13) recommended a check. Therefore, we deleted residues 264-274 in mutant G264Stop but found no dramatic activity decrease (Table 5). Consequently, RhuA differs from the two other enzymes by lacking a mobile peptide segment with catalytic competence, confirming the great evolutionary distance already detected in the alignment (Figure 4). Next we checked the importance of Arg28 with its unfavorable backbone dihedral angles by introducing two mutations. Both resulted in remarkable activity decreases, partially caused by a KM increase corresponding to a diminished binding strength. The activity dropped further when mutating Asn29 which contacts the phosphate and presumably also the 5-hydroxyl group of the substrate. As a surprise, the activity was even more strongly affected by mutation of Glu171 that points away from the active center in both crystal structures. The lowest activity of all, however, was measured upon mutation of Glu117 that is proposed to de- and reprotonate the O4 and C3 atoms of the substrate during the reaction. This confirmed the catalytic role of Glu117 and thus the position of the O4 atom in our model (Figure 6B). On first sight, the strong effect of the three Glu171 mutations appeared to contradict our substrate binding model. However, the two crystal forms were at pH values of 4.0 and 4.6 so that Glu171 from the neighboring subunit was drawn into a strong hydrogen bond with Glu27 as depicted in Figures 2 and 6B. At pH 7, however, both glutamates are charged and repel each other so that Arg28 is likely to connect the two carboxylates as modeled in Figure 6B. At its physiological position, Glu171 fixes the 5-hydroxyl and thus the aldehyde, explaining its importance for the catalysis. This proposal is supported by the strong conservation of Glu27, Arg28, and Glu171 within the RhuA family (Figure 4). At the modeled position, Glu171 can also act as a general acid/base catalyst for the opening of the predominant ring form (37) of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate because it can protonate the ring oxygen and bind the resulting 5-hydroxyl. After clarifying the substrate positions, we suggest that the aldol cleavage reaction proceeds in the following sequence. The ring form of L-rhamnulose-1-phosphate is opened by Glu171, and the resulting open form binds to the enzyme forming a diolate at the Zn2+. Glu117 abstracts a proton from O4, causing the split of the C3-C4 bond and the formation of a C3 carbanion, which is subsequently protonated by Glu117. The products L-lactaldehyde and DHAP dissociate. It has been suggested (19) that the aldol cleavage/addition reaction of FucA is energetically supported by the motion of the N-domain relative to the C-domain that manifests itself in the higher B-factors of the protruding N-domain with respect to the tetramer-forming C-domain. This proposal has now been refined because the highresolution structure of RhuA revealed a correlated anisotropic mobility of the N-domain that corresponds to a movement of the catalytic acid/base and the substrate phosphate toward the Zn2+ ion and the lactaldehyde, i.e., along the cleaved or formed bond of the reaction. We suggest that this movement supports the reaction mechanically.
