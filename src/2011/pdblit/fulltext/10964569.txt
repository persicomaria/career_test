Abstract We have identified a novel gene encoding a protein bearing GTP-binding motifs, the characteristics of GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited the highest overall homology with GTPBP1 and its mouse orthologue GP-1. Hence, we named the gene GTPBP2. The mouse orthologue of this gene, Gtpbp2, showed 98% identity with GTPBP2 over the entire protein (the HGMW-approved nomenclature symbol is GTPBP2 and mouse orthologue is Gtpbp2). A phylogenetic analysis showed GTPBP2 and homologous G proteins (GTPBP1, AGP-1, and CGP-1) did not belong to major G protein families. They formed a distinct branch in the phylogenetic tree, suggesting that they constitute a novel G protein family. A 2.9 kb mRNA was predominantly detected in the testis along with various other organs. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Gtpbp2 was predominantly expressed in spermatocytes and round-spermatids in the testis. These novel genes were localized to human chromosome 6p21.1­2 and mouse chromosome 17qC­D. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

hydrolysing GTP to GDP. This general mechanism enables G proteins to carry out a wide range of biological activities (Bourne et al., 1990; Kaziro et al., 1991). Based on the structural features, the superfamily can be grouped into three families. First, G proteins involved in protein synthesis, such as bacterial elongation factor ( EF )-Tu and eukaryotic EF-1a ( Kaziro et al., 1991). Second, the alpha subunits of the heterotrimic signaltransducing G proteins (hGa) which interact with cell surface receptors (Jurnak et al., 1990). The second family can be further divided into the following four classes by function: Gs, Gi, Gq, and G12 (Simon et al., 1991). Third, the small molecule GTP-binding proteins, whose molecular weights are around 20 kDa, have no subunit structure. The third family is sorted into the following five classes (Lacal and McCormick, 1993): Ras (Burgering and Bos, 1995); Rho ( Hall, 1998); Rab (Pfeffer, 1994); Arf families (Serafini et al., 1991); and the others (Moroianu, 1997). By PCR-based cDNA subtraction, the GTPBP1 gene was isolated from the interferon-gamma ( IFN-c)-treated

human monocytic cell line, THP-1, and expected to play some important roles in IFN-c stimulation (Senju and Nishimura, 1997). The GTPBP1 gene encodes a protein bearing GTP-binding motifs. The G protein motifs are well conserved among putative GTP-binding proteins of nematode, AGP-1 and CGP-1 (Huang et al., 1996). Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the GTP-binding protein superfamily, GTPBP2, which shows high similarity with GTPBP1 and its mouse orthologue, GP-1.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Nucleotide sequencing analysis The sequencing reactions were performed with a PRISM Ready Reaction Dye Deoxy Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer, CA). The sequence was determined with an ABI377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer). Sequence similarity searches were carried out with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and FASTA (Pearson, 1990). 2.2. cDNA cloning of GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 The original GTPBP2 was isolated by the yeast twohybrid screening system. In this two-hybrid system, the cytoplasmic region of BH-Protocadherin-c (amino acids 848­1200, GenBank Accession No. AB006757; Yoshida et al., 1998) was used as bait and cDNAs derived from the human brain mRNA were used as prey. One of the obtained clones, named No. 16, showed a novel nucleotide sequence (a 1112 bp fragment corresponding to nucleotide 1 to 1112 of GTPBP2; GenBank Accession No. AB024574). To isolate the full-length cDNA, a BLAST homology search was done with the No. 16 nucleotide sequence. We found an EST (GenBank Accession No. W00643) overlapped with the 3 part of the No. 16 nucleotide sequence. We cloned the overlapped EST and determined its nucleotide sequence. Mouse orthologue (Gtpbp2) was obtained by RT-PCR with the mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA with a 5 UTR primer (5-ACACAAATGAAGTGGCGGCTCCA-3) and a 3 UTR primer (5-CAGCATGGCCAGAAGTCAC-3) (GenBank Accession No. AB024573). 2.3. Northern blot analysis Human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN ) Blots 1 and 2 (Clontech, CA) containing approximately 2 mg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane were probed with the No. 16 cDNA. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out at 42°C with an ExpressHyb hybridization solution

(Clontech, CA). The blot was hybridized for 16 h and washed with vigorous agitation in 2×SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min and in 0.1×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 30 min. Mouse total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (GIBCO BRL, NY ) from the brain, heart, thymus, lung, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, stomach, small intestine, and testis. 20 mg of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 7% formaldehyde in MOPS buffer, transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham, UK ) and cross-linked with a UV crosslinker Funalinker (Funakoshi, Tokyo). Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 16 h. The membrane was washed with vigorous agitation in 1×SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 30 min. The blot was exposed to an Imaging plate ( Fuji Film, Tokyo) and signals on the plate were analyzed with a Bio-Image analyzer, BAS 2000 ( Fuji Film). 2.4. Tissue-specific localization analysis by in situ hybridization A cDNA fragment of Gtpbp2 was obtained by PCR and subcloned into a vector plasmid, pT7-blue (Novagen, WI ). Forward and reverse constructs were linearized with Eco RI ( TaKaRa, Japan) and subjected to in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of DIG-UTP (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). An adult mouse (C57BL/6 Cr Slc) was sacrificed by spiral elongation and the testis was quickly removed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at room temperature, and cryoprotected overnight at 4°C. After embedding in OCT-compound ( TissueTek, CA) and equilibrating at -20°C, 10 mm thick sections were cut on a cryostat and mounted onto gelatin-coated slides, and stored at -80°C until use. The sections were air-dried, fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed twice in PBS for 5 min, and treated with 10 mg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) in PBS. After a rinse in PBS for 5 min, the sections were fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min, then treated with 0.2% acetic anhydrorate in 0.1 M triethanolamine for 15 min, washed in PBS for 5 min, and dehydrated. Hybridization with the DIG-labeled cRNA probe (1 mg/ml ) was performed at 55°C overnight in a solution containing 50% formamide, 1×Denhardt's solution, 5×SSC, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 mg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5 mM EDTA. After hybridization, the sections were washed in 2×SSC at 55°C for 10 min, with 50% formamide, 2×SSC at 55°C for 30 min and then with 2×SSC at 37°C for 10 min. They were subsequently treated with 20 mg/ml RNase A in PBS at 37°C for 30 min and washed with 2×SSC at 37°C for 20 min then with 0.2×SSC at 45°C for 30 min. Hybridized riboprobes were detected with a DIG nucleic acid detec-

tion kit (Boehringer Mannheim), following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, each section was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) at room temperature for 1 h and phosphatase activity was visualized with NBT/BCIP (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro3-indolyl-phosphate). Sections were then counterstained with methyl green. 2.5. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of chromosomes To determine the chromosomal localization of GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH ) using the full-length cDNA as probes. FISH analysis was carried out by the methods as described previously with some modifications (Hirai et al., 1996). Biotinylated cDNA probes were hybridized to R-banded lymphocytes of normal donors. After overnight hybridization at 37°C, slides were washed in 50%

formamide/2×SSC at 42°C for 10 min, followed by washing in 1×SSC at room temperature for 15 min. The slides were then blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin/4×SSC at 37°C for 30 min. Signal amplification was achieved with rabbit anti-biotin IgG ( Enzo, Germany), fluoroescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG ( Enzo), and Cy2-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (Amersham). The chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide. Only twin-spot hybridization signals were scored. 2.6. Alignments and phylogenetic analysis Alignments of amino acid sequences were done with the CLASTALW program (Thompson et al., 1994). A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the aligned sequences by the neighbor-joining (NJ ) method (Saitou and Nei, 1987). The reliability of the tree was measured by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates ( Felsenstein, 1985).

3. Results 3.1. Identification of GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 cDNA During the previous two-hybrid screening with the cytoplasmic region of BH-Pcdh-c ( Yoshida et al., 1998), we isolated more than 30 positive clones ( Yoshida et al., 1999). One of the clones, No. 16, contained an approximately 1.1 kb insert. The nucleotide sequence of No. 16 revealed that the clone encoded a novel protein bearing GTP-binding motifs. We found an EST sequence (GenBank Accession No. W00643) that overlapped No. 16. We determined the 2853 bp nucleotide sequences of both No. 16 and the EST clone. The human 2.9 kb cDNA encoded a protein of 514 amino acids. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the database revealed that the predicted protein exhibited a high degree of homology to GTPBP1 and its mouse orthologue GP-1. Thus, we named the gene GTPBP2. The mouse orthologue of Gtpbp2 was isolated by RT-PCR with the mouse lung poly(A)+ RNA. The deduced amino acid sequence was highly conserved, indicating 98% identity over the entire protein (data not shown). 3.2. The primary structure of GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 The homology between the overall GTPBP2 and GTPBP1 proteins showed 49% identity and 66% similarity. GTPBP2 and GTPBP1 demonstrated 54% identity and 71% similarity at the N-terminal region containing G protein motifs. The C-terminal region also showed significant homology (43­66% identity). Moreover, GTPBP2 showed homology to G proteins of nematodes, AGP-1 (40­59% identity) and CGP-1 (40­ 59% identity) and those of archaebacteria, GTP-binding protein of Archaeoglobus fulgidus (30­52% identity, Accession No. AE001053; Klenk et al., 1997) and translation elongation factor ( EF )-1a-related protein of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (32­53% identity, Accession No. AE000887; Smith et al., 1997). As shown in Fig. 1, alignment of the GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 sequences with those of GTPBP1, GP-1, and deduced proteins of nematodes and archaebacteria revealed that all four (G1­G4 region, underlined in Fig. 1) G protein motifs were conserved among these proteins and that the level of identity between GTPBP2 and the other is highest in these regions. 3.3. Phylogenetic analysis of GTPBP2-related proteins To evaluate the phylogenetic relationship of GTPBP2 with other members of the G protein superfamily, we performed a phylogenetic analysis using amino acid

sequences of G protein families ( Fig. 2). Three major G protein groups formed their own clusters. Interestingly, GTPBP2 did not belong to any clusters. G proteins which showed homology to GTPBP2 shaped a distinct cluster, suggesting that these proteins may form a novel G protein family.

3.4. Expression of the GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 mRNA in various tissues To examine GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 mRNA sizes and their expression in various tissues, Northern blot analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 3, GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 were expressed as a major transcript of about 2.9 kb, equal to mouse transcripts. Among the human tissues examined, the expression of GTPBP2 was predominant in the heart, placenta, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and testis and less so in the brain, lung, kidney, and ovary (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, we detected predominant expression of Gtpbp2 in the thymus, spleen, and testis and less so in the brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle. There was no detectable mRNA in the stomach and small intestine among the mouse tissues examined (Fig. 3B). 3.5. Expression of Gtpbp2 in the testis Since a clear signal was observed in the testis of both species, we performed in situ hybridization to investigate the Gtpbp2 expression using testis sections of adult mice. Hybridized signals were distinctively observed over small-sized cells on the luminal side, presumably spermatocytes and round-spermatids, in a subpopulation of the seminiferous tubuli (Fig. 4).

3.6. Chromosomal localization We examined the chromosomal localization of GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Fig. 5). A clear doublet signal was consistently observed on human chromosome 6 at 6p21.1­2 ( Fig. 5A and B). Consistent with this assignment, the Gtpbp2 gene was mapped to the central region of mouse chromosome 17 at 17qC­D ( Fig. 5C and D). These results are in accordance with the predicted syntenic relationship between human and mouse chromosomes that share a homologous region in the distal part of their short arms ( Kostyu, 1994).

4. Discussion In this report, we described the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the G protein superfamily, GTPBP2 and its mouse orthologue Gtpbp2. The deduced amino acid sequence of GTPBP2 showed the highest homology with GTPBP1 (Senju and Nishimura, 1997), among the members of the G protein superfamily. Furthermore, GTPBP2 showed a homology with two nematode genes and two bacterial genes. The proteins coded by these genes formed a distinct cluster within the phylogenetic tree of the G protein

Fig. 5. Chromosomal localization of GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The cDNA for GTPBP2 and Gtpbp2 were biotinylated by nick-translocation with biotin-16-UTP and hybridized to R-banded chromosomes from cultured human (A) and mouse lymphocytes (C ), respectively. After hybridization, washing, and blocking, the signals were amplified with rabbit anti-biotin, fluoroscein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Cy2-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG.

superfamily ( Fig. 2). These results suggest the presence of a novel family of the G protein superfamily throughout mammals to bacteria. We should point out that none of these proteins are checked for their GTPase activities at this point, although it may be likely because of the high sequence conservation within G protein motifs. Besides the G protein motifs observed within the N-terminal half of these proteins, we found several conserved motifs within the C-terminal half of these proteins (Fig. 2 box 1­4). RKGMV (positions 398 to 402: box 2) and FEAEI (positions 416 to 420: box 3) are similarly conserved. FREG (positions 486 to 4899: box 4) is completely conserved. Furthermore, we noticed seven glycine residues between positions 335 and 361. The spacing between two successive glycine residues is four or five amino acids except at position 339. Of these regularly spaced six glycine residues, five residues are conserved among all the proteins. Interestingly, at position 351 just next to the non-conserved glycine, there is an aspartic acid

residue which is completely conserved for all the proteins (box 1). It is noteworthy that these motifs and glycine residues were conserved not only within mammals but also nematodes and some prokaryotes. If these motifs interact with some molecules, the molecules should share a common structure among mammalian, nematode, and prokaryotic cells. Thus, we speculate that these motifs may interact with non-protein moieties. It is also interesting that there is no protein similar to this family within eubacteria such as E. coli and H. influenzae. This supports the idea that archaebacteria are more closely related with eukaryotes than other prokaryotes ( Rowlands et al., 1994). The GTPBP2 expression in the testis, especially in spermatocytes and round-spermatids ( Fig. 4), suggests some roles in spermatogenesis. We also noticed the expression of this gene in a number of organs. But, there are some discrepancies between human and mouse ( Fig. 3). Although further study is needed to clarify the discrepancies, it is possible to assume that the expression of this gene is regulated by some outside stimuli. Indeed, GTPBP1, which shows the highest homology to GTPBP2, is induced by IFN-c (Senju and Nishimura, 1997). Previously, we detected BH-Pcdh-c mRNA predominantly in large type neuron of the cerebral cortex, septum, thalamus, substantia nigra, pons, and spiral cord. Furthermore, we isolated GTPBP2 to perform a yeast two-hybrid screening system using human brain cDNA library for candidate proteins, that interact with the intracellular domain of BH-Pcdh-c ( Yoshida et al., 1999). We detected GTPBP2 mRNA in the brain in the present study ( Fig. 3). One possibility is that the association of these two molecules may interact with the signal transduction in the brain.
