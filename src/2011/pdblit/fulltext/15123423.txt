Mammalian 3a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (3et-HSDs) inactivate circulating steroid hormones, and in target tissues regulate the occupancy of steroid hormone receptors. Molecular cloning indicates that 3et-HSDs are members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and display high sequence identity (>60%). Of these, the most extensively characterized is rat liver 3a-HSD. X-ray crystal structures of the apoenzyme and the E . NADP ÷ complex have been determined and serve as structural templates for other 3e~-HSDs. These structures reveal that rat liver 3e~-HSD adopts an (ed~)8-barrel protein fold. NAD(P)(H) lies perpendicular to the barrel axis in an extended conformation, with the nicotinamide ring at the core of the barrel, and the adenine ring at the periphery of the structure. The nicotinamide ring is stabilized by interaction with Y216, $166, D167, and Q190, so that the A-face points into the vacant active site. The 4-pro-(R) hydrogen transferred in the oxidoreduction of steroids is in close proximity to a catalytic tetrad that consists of D50, Y55, K84, and Hl17. A water molecule is within hydrogen bond distance of Hl17 and Y55, and its position may mimic the position of the carbonyl of a 3-ketosteroid substrate. The catalytic tetrad is conserved in members of the AKR superfamily and resides at the base of an apolar cleft implicated in binding steroid hormone. The apolar cleft consists of a side of apolar residues (L54, W86, F128, and F129), and opposing this side is a flexible loop that contains W227. These constraints suggest that the c~-face of the steroid would orient itself along that side of the cleft containing W86. Site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic tetrad indicates that Y55 and K84 are essential for catalysis. Y55S and Y55F mutants are catalytically inactive, but still form binary (E . NADPH) and ternary (E " NADH " Testosterone) complexes; by contrast K84R and K84M mutants are catalytically inactive, but do not bind steroid hormone. The reliance on a Tyr/Lys pair is reminiscent of catalytic mechanisms proposed for other AKR members as well as for HSDs that belong to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, in which Tyr is the general acid, with its pK, being lowered by Lys. Superimposition of the nicotinamide rings in the structures of 3c~-HSD (an AKR) and 3eL,20~-HSD (an SDR) show that the Tyr/Lys pairs are positionally conserved, suggesting convergent evolution across protein families to a common mechanism for HSD catalysis. W86Y and W227Y mutants bind testosterone to the E" NADH complex, with effective increases in K a of 8- and 20-fold. These data provide the first evidence that the side of the apolar cleft containing W86 and the opposing flexible loop containing W227 are parts of the steroid-binding site. Detailed mutagenesis studies of the apolar cleft and elucidation of a ternary complex structure will ultimately provide details of the determinants that govern steroid hormone recognition. These determinants could provide a rational basis for structure-based inhibitor design. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc. (Steroids 62:101-1l 1, 1997)

Mammalian 3e~-HSDs are members of the AKR superfamily. They work in concert with the 5e~- and 5[3reductases to generate the 3a/5~ and 3a/5[3-tetrahydrosteroids. These reactions are not innocuous. In steroid target tissues, 3a-HSDs work as molecular switches and control steroid hormone action (Figure 1). In the prostate, 3e~-HSD regulates the amount of androgen that can bind to the androgen receptor. It catalyzes the interconversion of the potent androgen 5et-dihydrotestosterone (5et-DHT) (Kd = 10 -11 M for the androgen receptor) to 3et-androstanediol (Kd = 10 -2 M for the androgen receptor), 8-1° and high levels of 5et-DHT are required for normal and abnormal growth of the prostate. Evidence exists in the dog prostate that 3a-HSD may work in concert with 5a-reductase to maintain high levels of 5~-DHT. T M lnhibitors of prostatic 3a-HSD may provide an opportunity for lowering 5a-DHT levels. In brain, 3e~-HSD regulates the amount of allosteric agonists that can bind to the GABA a receptorJ T M In this way 3c~-HSD can control C1- conductance and regulate the anxiolytic and anesthetic actions of 3a-hydroxysteroids. Thus 3~-HSDs regulate the amount of hormone that binds to a steroid hormone receptor, whether this receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily or a membrane-bound ion-gated channel. Therefore, 3aHSDs are potential drug targets. The most extensively characterized mammalian 3ot-HSD is the enzyme from rat liver. Based on the high sequence identity that exists (>60%) with other HSDs that belong to the AKR superfamily, it serves as a good structural template for these HSDs.

Purification and properties of rat liver 3a-HSD
We were the first to purify a mammalian 3ot-HSD from any source. The homogeneous enzyme can be obtained from rat liver in milligram amounts, where it represents 0.5 to 1.0% of the soluble protein. ]6 The enzyme functions as a monomer with a molecular weight of 37029, and p! = 6.0. Its complete kinetic mechanism has been studied in both directions at neutral pH.~7 It catalyzes a sequential ordered bi-bi mechanism in which pyridine nucleotide binds first and leaves last. The individual rate constants indicate that the rate-determining step in complex formation is the binding of cofactor to form a productive binary complex capable of binding steroid hormone. In contrast, isomerization of the central complex occurs readily. At physiological pH the oxidation reaction is favored by 3-fold, indicating that the reaction is freely reversible and that its direction is driven by prevailing steroid and cofactor concentrations. 3a-HSD, like other AKR members, is a nonmetalloenzyme that requires a general acid to polarize the acceptor carbonyl for hydride transfer. In the oxidation direction a general base is required to deprotonate the steroid hydroxyl group. The same amino acid may serve as both the general acid and general base (Figure 2). The identity of this amino acid will be addressed later. Mechanistic studies have also determined the stereochemistry of hydride transfer. It is known that it is the 4-pro-(R) hydrogen that is transferred from the A-face of the cofactor to the B-face of the steroid to make a 3~- or axial alcohol. 17

Molecular cloning of mammalian 3c~-HSDs
The availability of milligram quantities of rat liver 3a-HSD led to the development of a polyclonal antibody TM that was used to screen a h-gtl 1 expression library constructed against rat liver poly(A) + RNA. This led to the isolation of a full-length cDNA clone that had an open reading frame of 966 nucleotides and predicted a protein of 322 amino acids in length. 4 Other investigators have isolated similar clones. =9 - 21 The sequence of this cDNA shares high similarity (>70%) with the full-length clone for human liver type I 3oL-HSD (DD4 or chlordecone reductase), human liver DD1 (which is both a 3c~- and a 20a-HSD), and human liver DD2 (human bile-acid binding protein). 22'23 Subsequently a human liver type II 3c~-HSD has been cloned. 24 The human type I and type II 3a-HSDs differ in their K m values for 5a-DHT. The type I enzyme has a K m of 1.2 I~M, and the type II enzyme has a K m of 19.2 IxM for 5a-DHT, yet both subtypes display high sequence identity. Full-length cDNA

clones for human prostatic 3a-HSD have also been reported, which share high sequence identity with the rat and human liver enzymesY "26 Thus structural information to be presented for rat liver 3a-HSD is highly relevant to the human liver and human prostatic isoforms. Using the cDNA sequence for rat liver 3a-HSD as a search query to GENBANK, it was found that there was also high sequence identity (>58%) with members of the AKR superfamily. This represented the first time that an HSD has been assigned to this protein family. Members of this family include human placental aldose-reductase, 27 bovine and rat lens aldose reductase, 2s'e9 the aldehyde reductases, 3° prostaglandin F2,~ synthase, 3j and rho-crystallin of the frog lens. Other HSDs have since been assigned to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and include the human 3oL-HSD isoforms, 22-26 rabbit and rat ovarian 20aHSD, 5'6 bovine testicular 20c~-HSD, 7 and 17[3-HSD (A-face specific) from mouse liver, 32 It is anticipated that as more HSDs are cloned and sequenced, other HSDs will be asCornyebacterium. 2,5-diketo-gulconate reductase Pseudomonas morphine dehydrogenase alfalfa chalcone reductase soybean chalcone reductase human liver A4-3-ketosteroid-5l~ reductase mouse and rat liver A4-3-ketosteroid-5[~ reductase

signed to this superfamily. Interestingly, the 5[3-reductases that precede 3a-HSD in steroid hormone metabolism are also members of this superfamily. Cluster analysis indicates that the HSDs, the aldosereductases, and aldehyde-reductases represent different subdivisions of the same AKR superfamily (Figure 3). Enzymes that belong to each of these subdivisions turn over quite varied substrates and represent bonafide drug targets for different reasons. For example, HSDs act as molecular switches and control occupancy of the steroid hormone receptors by catalyzing the oxidoreduction of steroid hormones. HSD inhibitors should be useful in attenuating steroid hormone action. In contrast, aldose reductases convert glucose to sorbitol, a hyperosmotic sugar, which in diabetics can cause diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy. Aldose reductase inhibitors are sought for the prevention of the side effects of diabetes. Similarly, the aldehyde reductases work in concert with monoamine oxidases to metabolize catecholamines, and are targets for the development of antidepressants. Select inhibition of each of these drug targets requires a thorough understanding of what governs ligand recognition.

X-ray crystal structures of 3c~-HSD
The abundance of rat liver 3~x-HSD permitted its crystallization, via vapor diffusion techniques using ammonium sulfate as precipitant. Crystals obtained in this manner diffract to 3.0 /~, and the phasing problem was solved by molecular replacement using the X-ray coordinates for the human placental aldose-reductase (ADR). NADPH binary complex provided by Dr. Florante Quiocho. 33 The crystal structure obtained represents the first for a mammalian HSD that belongs to the AKR superfamily. 34 The apoenzyme structure was solved to a nominal resolution of 3.1/~ and adopts an (a/[3)8-barrel or triose-phosphate isomerase-barrel protein fold (Figure 4). This fold is characterized by an alternating pattern of e~-helix and [3-strands, with the [3-strands forming the staves of a barrel in the core of the structure. When the structure is rotated 90 ° around the barrel axis, two large loops appear at the C-terminal end of the barrel. One loop, loop B, was not well defined in the electron density and was modeled using the coordinates for human placental aldose reductase. These loops contribute to a large apolar cleft that is 11 /~ deep and of sufficient size to accommodate steroid ligands. On one side of the cleft several apolar residues exist, including Leu54, Trp86, Phe128, and Phe129. On the opposing loop B, other hydrophobic residues are present, including Trp227. NADPH was modeled into the structure using the coordinates from the ADR. NADPH binary complex. In this model, the C4 position of the nicotinamide ring is in close proximity to four hydrophilic residues, Asp50, Tyr55, Lys84, and Hisll7, and may comprise a catalytic tetrad. These residues are invariant in HSDs that belong to the AKR superfamily. Based on this model, a catalytic mechanism was proposed in which Tyr55 was implicated as the general acid, and its effective pK a was lowered by hydrogen bonding with Lys84, which in turn was salt-linked to Asph0 (Figure 5). A binary-complex structure has recently been solved to 2.7 A resolution and provides an atomic model of how

It lies perpendicular to the barrel axis, with the nicotinamide ring facing the core of the barrel and the adenine ring lying at the periphery of the structure (Figure 4). The orientation of the nicotinamide ring is anti- with respect to the nicotinamide ribose moiety, and the B-face of the pyridine ring of the cofactor stacks against the aromatic ring of Tyr216. The stereochemistry of the nicotinamide ring is maintained by hydrogen bonds between the carboxamide group and Ser166, Asn167, and Glnl90. In this manner the A-face of

vides a good reference point for the position of the carbonyl group at the C3 position of 3-ketosteroid substrates (Figure 7). Based on the proximity of the water molecule to Tyr55 and the nicotinamide ring, Tyr55 would appear to be a strong candidate for the general acid.

the cofactor is presented to the active site cavity so that 4-pro-(R) stereochemistry of hydride transfer is achieved. The structure shows that the 2'-phosphate of the adenine ring is accommodated by hydrogen bonds and a counterion with Ser271 and Arg276; these interactions may contribute to the preference of 3a-HSD for NADPH (Kd = 190 nM) over NADH (Kd = 165 ~M). Of the 18 amino acids that are involved in binding cofactor to ADR, 11 are positionally conserved in the 3et-HSD-NADP ÷ binary complex structure. The atomic interactions that form between 3a-HSD and the nicotinamide and adenine rings of the dinucleotide are shown in Figure 6. The binary structure also reveals the presence of a welldefined water molecule at the active site. This water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with H i s l l 7 and Tyr55. A similar water molecule has been observed in the active sites of other members of the AKR superfamily and lies in the same position as the oxygen atoms in several inhibitors, e.g., zopolrestat, cacodylate, citrate, and glucose-637 phosphate.-33·36" The position of this w a te r mol e c ule p r o-

Comparison of two HSD protein families
Structures now exist for mammalian HSDs that belong to the SDR and AKR superfamilies. HSDs that are SDRs usually function as multimers. Each monomer varies in molecular mass from 25 to 37 kDa and is characterized by a fold that consists of seven-stranded parallel t3-sheets surrounded by six a-helices, with three helices on either side of the 13-sheets. This arrangement provides a Rossmann fold for binding the cofactor. Their active sites contain a conserved catalytic motif (Tyr-X-X-X-Lys) (Figure 8). In contrast, HSDs that are AKRs are monomeric, with a molecular mass of 34-39 kDa. They adopt an (et/13)s-barrel fold, they do not bind NADPH across a Rossman fold, and instead they may form a salt-linked safety belt for binding the pyrophosphate bridge of the cofactor. They contain a conserved catalytic tetrad of Asp50, Tyr55, and Lys84, and His 117 (numbering according to 3ct-HSD). An examination of the deduced amino acid sequences for HSDs indicates that the Tyr-X-X-X-Lys motif can also be present irrespec-

zymes have been obtained in milligrams amounts for kinetic and structural studies: Y55F, Y55S, Y205F, K84R, K84M, D50N, D50E, and H117A. 41'42 The fidelity of each mutant enzyme was verified by sequencing the entire cDNA to ensure that the DNA polymerase used in the PCR reactions did not misincorporate nucleotides. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed on each mutant to measure purity and to ensure that when an inactive enzyme was expressed, the correct protein was purified. In characterizing these mutants it was found that the Y205F mutant was kinetically indistinguishable from the wild type and could catalyze the oxidation of androsterone and the reduction of androstanedione unimpeded. This represents the first time that the conserved Tyr in the SDR motif (Tyr-X-X-X-Lys) has been mutated with retention of enzyme activity, and shows that it cannot be the general acid for catalysis in 3et-HSD (Table 2). These data can be explained by the position of Tyr205 in the crystal structure, since it is located on the periphery of the structure on a a-helix. In contrast, the Y55F mutant was unable to perform steroid oxidoreduction and the Y55F, Y55S, K84R, and K84M mutants were all inactive. The D50N, D50E, and H117A mutants were severely impeded as enzymes but still performed steroid oxidoreduction. These mutants had catalytic efficiencies that were 1/30th, 1/30th, and 1/500th of wild type, respectively. On this basis Asp50 and His117 are unlikely to be the general acid for catalysis (Table 3). To determine whether the mutant enzymes were inactive because they cannot form binary and ternary complexes, the formation of the E" NADPH complex was measured by titrating the tryptophan fluorescence of the protein, and the formation of the E - N A D H . testosterone complex was measured by equilibrium dialysis. It was found that mutants of the catalytic tetrad were able to form the binary complex, E . NADPH unimpeded, yielding K d values that fluctuated no more than 2.0-fold over that observed with the wild-type recombinant enzyme. Since the Kj for NADPH is in the nanomolar range, these data indicated that these mutations did not cause a global change in protein structure (Table 4). Furthermore it was concluded that the loss of enzyme ac-

tive of whether they are SDR members (Table 1). For example, this motif is found in rat liver 3o~-HSD, in which Tyr205 and Lys209 are the corresponding residues in this motif. When the Tyr in this motif has been mutated in SDRs, this had led to inactive enzyme. 3s-4° It has been suggested that the Tyr/Lys pair in SDRs is essential for enzyme activity, and that lysine lowers the pK, of the tyrosine so that it can act as the general acid. Thus Tyr205 and Lys209 as well as the catalytic tetrad are candidates for mutagenesis in 3cx-HSD.

Overexpression and site-directed mutagenesis of rat liver 3 a - H S D
The full-length cDNA for rat liver 3a-HSD was subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector to yield pKK3aHSD. 41 Transformation of Escherichia coli DH5a cells led to the production of milligram quantities of homogeneous recombinant 3o~-HSD (r3o~-HSD). The kinetic properties of the wild-type enzyme were almost identical to those of the native enzyme purified from rat liver cytosol. The recombinant enzyme was amenable to crystallization. Sitedirected mutagenesis of Tyr205 and the catalytic tetrad was performed using PCR methods. The following mutant en-

The Y55F and Y55S mutants displayed increases of 30-fold in the K d for testosterone, but this change was insufficient to explain the complete loss of enzyme activity observed in these mutants.

lytically inactive, and yet the Tyr55 mutants retain the ability to form ternary complexes, Tyr55 becomes the strongest candidate for the general acid. These data support the catalytic mechanism originally proposed (Figure 5), but do not rule out a role for Lys84, His117, or water as the general acid.

Convergent evolution to a common reaction mechanism in HSDs
It is striking that HSDs that belong to the SDR and AKR families have evolved to be reliant on a Tyr/Lys pair for catalysis. To determine whether these catalytic residues are positionally conserved across these protein families, we have superimposed the nicotinamide tings in crystal structures of 3ot-HSD (an AKR) and 3a,2013-HSD (a SDR). It was found that the positions of the Tyr/Lys pair were conserved across the family. These residues fall within 0.5/~ of each other in the two proteins (Figure 9). These data suggest that different protein scaffolds have evolved to bring together the same catalytic residues in close proximity so that a common reaction mechanism can take place for all HSDs. In the proposed mechanism, Tyr acts as a general acid and its pK a is effectively lowered by Lys, so that catalysis can occur at physiological pH.

Steroid hormone recognition in I-ISDs that are AKRs
HSDs are characterized by the positional and stereochemistry of the oxidoreductions they perform. In the AKR superfamily, 3c~-HSDs, 1713-HSDs, and 20eL-HSDs all exist. In target tissues these enzymes have the potential to function as androgen, estrogen and progestin switches. These enzymes share high sequence identity and predicted threedimensional structures and apolar binding clefts that are

similar. Yet the structural basis for the differences in substrate specificity remains unclear. Although a crystal structure of a ternary complex of an AKR. NADPH" steroid complex would solve this issue, none has been obtained. To gain insights into structural determinants for steroid hormone recognition we have used secosteroid mechanismbased inactivators and site-directed mutagenesis as complementary techniques. Although 3a-HSD has no demonstrable 20a-HSD activity, 20a-HSDs are structurally related (Figure 3). To determine whether 3ot-HSD could bind steroids backward, we used a series of A-ring and D-ring secosteroids in which acetylenic alcohols were introduced at the equivalent of the C3 and C17 positions of the steroid nucleus (e.g., 3(R,S)1,10-seco-5e~-estr-l-yne,3,17[5-diol, 1, and 17(R,S)-17hydroxy-14,15,-secoandrost-4-en-15-yn-3-one, 3). These alcohols, if oxidized by 3a-HSD, would generate acetylenic ketones 2 and 4, which could then inactivate the enzyme by forming Michael adducts with enzyme nucleophiles (Figure 10). 43 It was found that the A- and D-ring acetylenic alcohols 1 and 3 inactivated 3a-HSD provided NAD ÷ was present. These data provided direct evidence of the backward binding and turnover of secosteroids by this enzyme. Using a series of site-directed mutants, it was also determined that one mutant, the C217A mutant, was totally resistant to inTable 4 Ability of mutants of the catalytic tetrad of 3~-HSD to form binary and ternary complexes

activation by the secosteroids.43 In contrast, C170A and C242A mutants were still inactivated in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type enzyme. These data suggest that the point of covalent attachment for acetylenic ketones 2 and 4 generated by the enzyme is Cys217. To determine the contribution of individual residues in the apolar cleft to binding steroid hormones, the three tryptophans in 3o~-HSD were mutated to tyrosines. Of these, W86 is on one side of the cleft in an apolar environment and lies opposite the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, whereas W227 resides on an opposing loop (loop B). In contrast, W148 resides on the periphery of the structure and is buried within a a-helix. Kinetic characterization of the purified mutants showed that W148 could catalyze steroid oxidoreduction in a manner indistinguishable from that of the wild type and plays no role in steroid binding or catalysis (Table 5). In contrast, the W86Y mutant played a role in both cofactor and steroid binding. In the oxidation direction the K m for androsterone was increased 3-fold, and the Km for NAD ÷ was increased 6-fold; similarly, in the reduction direction the K m for androstanedione was increased 6-fold, %, Y15~,~ K84 Hll
Superimposition of AKR and SDR active sites, The binary c o m p l e x 3~-HSD. NADP + (an AKR) was superimposed on that of 3~-20B-HSD · NAD + from Streptomyceshydrogenans (a SDR). The superimposition was based on the position of the nicotinamide ring (not including the carboxamide substituent at the C3 position), The reason for this exclusion is that 3Q-HSD displays 4-pro-(R) hydride transfer, whereas 3~,20B-HSD displays 4-pro-(S) hydride transfer, so that although the nicotinamide rings lie in the same plane, they are flipped 180 ° relative
to each other and the carboxamide groups do not superimpose.

and the K m for NADH was increased 8-fold. The W227Y mutant displayed differences mainly in steroid binding; thus the K m for androsterone was increased 9-fold and the K m for androstanedione was increased by 43-fold. These alternations in steroid affinity were confirmed by equilibrium dialysis measurements where the binding of testosterone to the E . NADH complex was measured in both mutants. It was found that the W86Y and W227Y mutants bound testosterone with effective increases in K d of 8- and 20-fold, respectively.~ These data provide the first evidence that

residues that make up portions of the apolar cleft are involved in binding steroid. The data can be interpreted with the aid of the structural model. W86 is on one side of the apolar cleft and within 10 A of the cofactor; therefore mutation of this residue affects binding of both substrates. W227 is on a flexible loop that is opposite W86, and much of this loop is undefined in the electron density. The ability of the W227 mutant to have a dramatic effect on steroid binding indicates that this residue and its associated loop may interact with the face or the edge of the steroid. Similar

movements in the loops of other AKR members are believed to be important in binding inhibitors. Based on the position of the catalytic tetrad, the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, the water molecule that is hydrogen bonded at the active site, and the tryptophan mutagenesis data, a model for steroid hormone binding has developed. In this model, the C3 carbonyl of the steroid ligand would displace the water molecule; to retain the stereochemistry of the reaction, the a-face of the steroid would orient itself to the side of the apolar cleft that contains W86, and the 13-face of the steroid would face the opposing loop B, which contains W227. Even with these constraints, it is still not possible to list structural determinants in the AKR superfamily that explain the positional and stereochemical preference of HSDs for their different substrates. Why are these issues important? Until the structural basis for steroid hormone recognition is understood it will not be possible to conduct structure-based inhibitor design. Inhibitors for 3aHSD are sought since in androgen target tissues the enzyme can regulate the occupancy of the androgen receptor. These inhibitors may have a role in the management of prostatic disease. Similarly, inhibitors for 20a-HSD are sought, since this enzyme terminates progesterone action by forming the inactive progestin 20a-hydroxyprogesterone. 20et-HSD inhibitors may have a role in preventing leuteolysis and in the maintenance of pregnancy.
