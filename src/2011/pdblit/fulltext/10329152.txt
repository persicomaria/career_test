Hybridization of Alpha Class Subunits Generating a Functional Glutathione Transferase A1-4 Heterodimer
Ann Gustafsson, Lisa O. Nilsson and Bengt Mannervik*
Department of Biochemistry Uppsala University, Biomedical Center, Box 576, SE-751 23 Uppsala, Sweden Within the Alpha class of the mammalian glutathione transferases two variants of subunit interfaces exist. One is conserved among the A4 subunits, whereas the second one is found in all other members of the Alpha class. The ability of the two Alpha class subunit interfaces to adopt a functional heterodimeric structure has been investigated here. The heterodimer GST A1-4 was obtained by co-expression of the two human Alpha class subunits A1 and A4 in Escherichia coli. A histidine tail was added to the N terminus of the A1 subunit to facilitate the puri®cation of the heterodimer. The heterodimer was formed in a small proportion implying that the ef®ciency of the hybridization between subunit A1 and A4 is less than the propensity for homodimer formation. The hybrid enzyme was stable at low temperatures, but the two subunits dissociated and reassociated into homodimers at 40  C. Three different substrates were used for subunit-selective kinetic characterization of the GST A1-4 heterodimer: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, nonenal and Á5-androstene-3,17-dione. Both subunit A1 and subunit A4 were active in GST A1-4, but the speci®c activities and kcat values were lower than the average values of the two parental isoenzymes. However, at high temperatures the subunits of the hybrid enzyme dissociated and formed homodimers, and the activities increased to expected values. Hence, the low activities of the individual subunits in the heterodimer were reversible. The non-additive kinetic properties of the subunits in the heterodimer therefore highlight the importance of ®ne-tuned subunit interactions for optimal catalytic ef®ciency of GST A1-1 and GST A4-4.

Introduction
The glutathione transferases (GSTs) were originally divided into different classes based on the relationship between their primary structures, their substrate speci®cities and their immunological properties.1 Both homo- and heterodimeric isoenzymes of the soluble GSTs are found in nature, but no physiological explanation for the dimeric structure or for the function of the heterodimers has

been given. At present, eight distinct classes of the soluble mammalian GSTs have been identi®ed: Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Omega, Pi, Sigma, Theta and Zeta.1 ± 7 The heterodimers isolated from natural sources are all class-constrained and so far heterodimers have been found only in the Mu and Alpha classes. Each GST subunit has a catalytic pocket that is composed of two binding sites: the glutathionebinding site (G-site) and the hydrophobic substrate-binding site (H-site).8 Amino acids from both subunits contribute to the formation of the glutathione-binding site but the active sites of the different subunits nevertheless seem to function independently with several substrates and inhibitors.9 ± 11 Structural investigations have revealed many features of the subunit interface that are conserved in the members of the distinct GST classes,12 ± 14 but

396 the differences that do exist among subunits of different classes make their interfaces incompatible. However, the structure of the interface may vary also within a class, since two variant interfaces can be distinguished among the Alpha class enzymes. A comparison between the primary structures of the human, mouse, and rat Alpha class enzymes reveals subunit interactions that distinguish the GST A4-4 from the other Alpha class GSTs (Figure 1). GST A4-4 is the most deviant isoenzyme within the Alpha class and heterodimers containing subunit A4 have not so far been isolated from natural sources. Puri®cation of enzymes from rat liver has demonstrated heterodimeric combinations of GST subunits A1, A2, A3 and A516 ± 18 whereas GST A1-2 has been isolated from human liver.19 There are three different structural determinants in the Alpha class GSTs that are responsible for subunit hybridization. First, there is a lock-and-key motif where residues 51 and 52 in one subunit protrude into a hydrophobic pocket of the second subunit formed by residues 94, 98, 135, 136, and 139 (Figure 2). Secondly, the interface shows an extensive network of inter- and intra-subunit salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which in GST A1-114 involves residues Arg89, Asp93, Tyr82, Arg155 and Asn73 (Figure 3(a)). Of the network residues, only Arg 89 and Asp93 are found in the human GST A4-415 (Figures 1 and 3(b)). Thirdly, the guanidino group of Arg69 stacks on top of the equivalent residue of the other subunit and forms a salt bridge to Glu97 (Figure 4). Here, the structural and functional compatibility of the interfaces of human GST A1 and GST A4 subunits has been investigated. Heterologous expression of the two subunits in Escherichia coli gave the heterodimer GST A1-4, showing that the similarities between the two interfaces are suf®ciently extensive to allow dimerization. However, the hybrid enzyme was more heat-sensitive than the homodimers and the different subunits dissociated and formed homodimers at temperatures above 40  C.

Characterization of a GST A1-4 Heterodimer

GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 have distinct substrate selectivities with CDNB, nonenal, and AD and this provided a tool for a kinetic investigation of the functional status of the two different subunits in the heterodimer. Both subunits of GST A1-4 proved to be catalytically active. However, they did not display full activity, as compared to the homodimer subunits, with either of the following substrates: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and Á5-androstene-3,17-dione (AD), giving high activity with subunit A1, and nonenal, characterizing subunit A4 activity.

Results
Expression and purification The heterodimer of GST A1-4 was expressed in E. coli, and puri®ed essentially as described previously for production of a heterodimeric variant of GST A1-1.10 Two different pET-vectors were used for expression, and subunit A1 contained a histidine tail to facilitate the isolation of the heterodimer. It has previously been shown that six additional histidine residues in the N terminus of GST A1-1 do not affect the catalytic activity of the enzyme.10 The cDNA encoding the A4 subunit, earlier expressed from the pKKD 223-3 vector,20 was subcloned into the pET-21 vector for coexpression with the A1 subunit. The yield of the GST A4-4 enzyme was slightly increased by the shift from the pKKD expression system to the pET system. However, upon concomitant expression with subunit A1, the production of subunit A4 was almost completely suppressed. The level of GST A1-1 remained at about 60 mg/liter culture. In order to counterbalance the strong A1 expression, the A4 cDNA was optimized by silent mutations for expression in E. coli.21 The enhanced expression of subunit A4 gave a more favorable subunit ratio and suf®cient amounts of GST A1-4 were obtained for puri®cation and further characterization. Two separation steps were needed in order to get the heterodimer free from the parental homodi-

397 emerged at 0.3 M NaCl and was 50 % pure as judged from SDS-PAGE (Figure 5). Less than 2 mg was obtained from a one-liter culture. The peak corresponding to the heterodimer appeared at 0.65 M NaCl in the gradient. Two peaks containing GST A1-1 were obtained. One emerged just after the heterodimer peak at 0.7 M NaCl and the other one at 0.8 M NaCl. Proteins from the two peaks displayed essentially the same speci®c activity with nonenal and CDNB, respectively, and did not contain any degradation products detectable by SDS-PAGE. They also had the same isoelectric point. The cause of the appearance of two peaks was not further investigated. Possibly, the ®rst peak contained GST A1-1 with a partially degraded, or in some other way truncated, histidine tail. Since the second peak was much larger and emerged at the expected concentration of NaCl, protein from this peak was used for characterization of the enzyme. The heterodimer fraction contained both large amounts of the GST A1-1 homodimer and other, unknown, contaminating proteins (Figure 5). Therefore the heterodimer was further puri®ed on Ni2 -immobilized metal-ion af®nity chromatography (IMAC), and separated from the GST A1-1 homodimer by imidazole gradient elution. IMAC-puri®cation increased twofold the speci®c activity of the heterodimer sample toward nonenal. The speci®c activity with CDNB was decreased, indicating the elimination of the GST A1-1 homodimer. However, the speci®c activities did not equal the expected values calculated as the mean of the activities of the two homodimers (Table 1). For nonenal the speci®c activity was 18 mmol minÀ1 mgÀ1, the expected value being 90 mmol minÀ1 mgÀ1 (the speci®c activity of GST A4-4 is 180 mmol minÀ1 mgÀ1). Similarly, the CDNB activity was only 14 mmol minÀ1 mgÀ1, which is one third of the predicted value (GST A1-1 had a speci®c activity of 89 mmol minÀ1 mgÀ1). Both SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing (IEF) veri®ed the purity of GST A1-4 (Figures 5 and 6(a)). The size difference between the two subunits in the heterodimer, caused by the six extra amino acid residues in the histidine tail of the A1 subunit, allowed their separation on SDS-PAGE, and two individual bands having the same intensity were detected. On the IEF gel the heterodimer focused

The sidechain conformation of Arg69 varies among the three different structures. The conformation in the apoenzyme structure of GST A1-1 and the GST A4-4 structure results in a decrease of the distance between Arg69 and Asp101 of the same subunit. The closest contact is seen in the GST A4-4 structure where the Ê distance is 4.4 A as compared Ê to 6.1 A in the structure of GST A1-1 in complex with S-benzylglutathione. The conformations adopted by Arg69 in apo-GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 eliminate the contact between Arg69 and Glu97, whereas in the structure of the GST A1-1 S-benzylglutathione complex one of the Z nitrogen atoms interacts with Glu97.

as a single band at pH 8.7 (between GST A1-1 and GST A4-4, which have isoelectric points at pH 8.9 and 8.2, respectively). The purity of the heterodimer was also veri®ed by total amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis (data not shown). The yield of the heterodimer was approximately 1.5 mg from one liter of bacterial culture. The total expression level of the A4 subunit was about 34 mg. An expression of 4 mg of the A4 subunit and 22 mg of the A1 subunit should give a ratio of the GST A4-4 to GST A1-4 to GST A1-1 of about 1:11:30, assuming that the two different subunits hybridize with a probability equal to that of homodimer formation. Since the experimental ratio was about 1:1:13, and differed from a binomial distribution, the folding and assembly of the two homodimers appear to be favored over formation of the heterodimer.

Thermal stability of the GST A1-4 heterodimer In order to determine the stability of the three variant Alpha class enzymes, samples of each protein were incubated for 20 minutes at different temperatures ranging from 0 to 60  C. The speci®c activity was measured under standard conditions with CDNB and with nonenal (Table 1). GST A4-4 was stable at temperatures up to 40  C. The protein precipitated at 50  C and all activity was lost in the sample. GST A1-1 denatured and formed a precipitate at 60  C. Below their denaturation temperatures, the speci®c activities of both homodimers were essentially constant. In contrast, the activity of the samples containing the heterodimer increased with temperature (Table 1). Incubation at 40  C enhanced the nonenal activity four to ®vefold, concomitantly with an

For orientation and comparison, the GST A1-1 residues Arg89, Asp93 and Asn73 are shown in blue. The guanidino group of Arg89 in the GST A4-4 structure points away from the subunit interface and forms an intra-subunit salt bridge with Asp77. Residue 77 is not-conserved but is an alanine, serine or threonine in the other Alpha class isoenzymes. As in GST A1-1, Asp93 interacts across the dimer interface with residue 73, which is a histidine in GST A4-4. Asp93 also forms an inter-subunit hydrogen bond to Ser70.

Wells 5-7 were loaded with samples from the Ni2-IMAC puri®cation of peak 2 from the SP cation-exchanger. The ®rst peak eluted is in well number 5.

approximately twofold increase of CDNB activity. An IEF analysis of the various samples (Figure 6(b)) revealed that this was due to a dissociation of the heterodimer and formation of the corresponding homodimers. At 50  C the newly formed homodimer of GST A4-4 precipitated and all nonenal activity was lost, whereas the CDNB activity was further increased to approach the predicted activity of approximately 40 mmol minÀ1 mgÀ1. Kinetic properties of the GST A1-4 heterodimer CDNB, AD and nonenal were used to determine the kinetic properties of the heterodimer. With all three electrophiles the heterodimer displayed an activity less than predicted from those of the parental enzymes GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 (Figure 7). For CDNB the kcat values are only slightly lower than predicted. Theoretically, if the KM values of the two subunits in the heterodimer are different the substrate saturation will deviate from the hyperbolic Michaelis-Menten curve.22 For example, with CDNB as the second substrate the KGSH M values of GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 were 0.17 mM and 1.9 mM, respectively, suggesting that a second-degree rational function should be needed to ®t the experimental data. However, since the activity of subunit A1 is so much higher than the

The four samples to the right derive from the heterodimer GST A1-4 incubated for 20 minutes at 20, 30, 40, and 50  C, respectively. At 40  C the heterodimer dissociated and the subunits reassociated into homodimers. The sample incubated at 50  C was centrifuged before IEF to remove the precipitate of GST A4-4 and the only band appearing corresponds to the homodimeric GST A1-1.

activity of subunit A4 the contribution of subunit A4 is minor and the deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics was found negligible. Similarly, the KM values of the heterodimer with nonenal should equal the Michaelis constants of GST A4-4. This was not the case however, the largest deviations from the predicted saturation curves were obtained with AD and nonenal (Figure 7). The Michaelis constant for the isomerization reaction with AD did not deviate from the expected value, but the KM value for the nonenal reaction was about fourfold lower, i. e. in the range of the value for GST A1-1. The kcat values with both substrates were about three to fourfold lower than the calculated values (Table 2). Since both the kcat and the KM values decreased by the same factor for the nonenal substrate, kcat/KM remained unchanged.

Discussion
A GST hybrid of the two human Alpha class subunits A1 and A4 has been expressed heterologously, puri®ed and characterized. This heterodi-

meric variant has not so far been isolated from natural sources and the A4 subunit has previously been considered incapable of heterodimer formation.23 However, in the literature, there is indirect evidence that heterodimers containing the A4 subunit may exist naturally. A sample of S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose af®nity puri®ed GSTs from rat liver was subjected to chromatofocusing.24 Two Alpha class subunits, 1 and 8 (previous designations of the rat counterparts to the human A1 and A4 subunits), eluted in the same fraction at a pH value several units higher than the isoelectric point of GST 8-8, indicating that they derived from a heterodimer. The present study suggests that the human A4 subunit could hybridize with other Alpha class subunits in vivo, even though the assembly of the homodimeric GST A4-4 is favored over the combination of subunit A1 with A4. The statistically unfavorable hybridization is indicated by the small amounts of the heterodimer formed in the coexpression of subunits A1 and A4. Approximately 1 mg A4 subunit was recovered as the heterodimer

Parameter values and their standard deviation were obtained by non-linear regression analysis. The kcat values in many cases are only apparent values since the concentrations of the unvaried substrate could not be raised to saturating levels. The predicted values for GST A1-4 were obtained from ®tting the mean of the GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 curves.

Characterization of a GST A1-4 Heterodimer

403 with CDNB as the electrophile, but GST A1-1 is the more ef®cient catalyst also with this substrate. Even though the dimer interface formed in the GST A1-4 heterodimer is non-optimal due to the isoenzyme-speci®c differences in structure, the heterodimer was active with both GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 characteristic substrates. However, the values of the speci®c activities and the steady-state kinetic parameters deviated from the numbers that could be calculated from the two parental homodimers (Tables 1 and 2, Figure 7). Therefore both subunits in the heterodimer were obviously catalytically somewhat impaired. The kcat values displayed by the heterodimer at 30  C with the substrates favored by subunit A1, CDNB and AD, were only 70 % and 30 %, respectively, of the average value of the homodimers (Table 2). For nonenal, both the KM and kcat values were reduced to approximately 25-30 % of the theoretical values, giving a catalytic ef®ciency that was essentially the same or slightly higher than predicted. Nevertheless, it was shown that the activity lost in the individual subunits of the heterodimer could be regained by heat-induced dissociation of the heterodimer. A more than twofold and four to ®vefold increased speci®c activity was noted with CDNB and nonenal, respectively (Table 1), and an IEF analysis showed that the subunits had reassociated as homodimers. (Figure 6(b)). This reversibility of both the dimeric structure and the functional properties demonstrates that a subunit is affected by the nature of its subunit complement in the dimer. Previous kinetic studies of heterodimeric variants of the GSTs isolated from natural sources9,11,16 as well as recombinantly produced10 have suggested a subunit to be insensitive to the nature of the neighboring subunit. However, there are other studies indicating cooperativity between the two subunits of a GST. A crystal structure of mouse GST A4-428 displays an asymmetry in which one active site is involved in glutathione binding, whereas the second active site binds the conjugation product of 4-hydroxynonenal and glutathione. These ®ndings led to a model in which only one subunit is active at a time and where inter-subunit signaling was effected by ¯uctuation of the side-chain conformation of Arg69 and Arg15. Recently, half-of-the-sites reactivity was demonstrated with some (but not all) electrophilic substrates of GST A1-1.29 A structural communication between the subunits has furthermore been suggested for mutant forms of human GST P11.30,31 A positive kinetic cooperativity was induced by the mutations C47A, C47S and K54A. Hence, the lowered kcat values of the human GST A1-4 heterodimer observed here could be explained by a partial inhibition of the suggested cross-talk between the two subunits,28,29 at least in the reaction with nonenal. Structural alterations of the subunit interface may be detrimental to the catalytic activity of the GSTs. Introduction of a serine in the key position

with subunit A1, while, according to a binomial distribution, at least 3 mg should have formed the heterodimer. Moreover, the subunit interactions of the heterodimer were temperature-sensitive. At 40  C the hybrid enzyme dissociated and the monomers reassociated as homodimers (Figure 6(b)). The low yield and moderate stability of GST A14 could be explained by the differences in amino acid residues at the interface of the two subunits. A superimposition of the GST A1-1 structure14 on the structure of GST A4-415 reveals that the largest differences between GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 in the subunit interface are found in the lock-and-key motif and in the network of electrostatic interactions. In the lock-and-key motif, Met51 in GST A1-1 reaches much further into the hydrophobic cavity of the second subunit than does Leu51 in GST A44 (Figure 2). Upon formation of the heterodimer GST A1-4, Met51 of subunit A1 is likely to collide with the lock residue Val135 in the A4 moiety. In GST A1-1 the corresponding residue is the smaller alanine. The third residue differing in the lock-andkey motif is number 139, which is a valine in subunit A1 and an isoleucine in subunit A4 (Figure 1). The network of inter-subunit hydrogen bonds and salt bridges that are formed between residues located mainly in helix 3 and helix 4 (Figure 3(a)) show clear differences between GST A1-1 and GST A4-4. All residues involved in the network are conserved in the known mouse, rat, and human Alpha class isoenzymes, except in the A4-4 variants (Figure 1). Only Asp93 and Arg89 are present in GST A4-4 (Figure 1) but these residues do not form the inter-subunit bonds (Figure 3) seen in GST A11. On the whole, there are fewer electrostatic interactions formed between the subunits of GST A4-4 in this region of the subunit interface. The guanidino groups of the two equivalent Arg69 stack on top of each other in both subunits A1 and A4.14,15 However, the side-chains of the residues adopt somewhat different conformations (Figure 4) in the available structures. In GST A1-1 the conformations seem to be dependent on the occupancy of the active site. In the ligand-free apoenzyme structure of GST A1-125 and in the ligandcontaining structure of GST A4-4,15 the side-chain of Arg69 points in the opposite direction as compared to the structure of the binary complex of GST A1-1 and benzylglutathione.14 Arg69 forms a salt bridge to Glu97 (Figure 4). Both these residues are conserved among all human Alpha class enzymes (Figure 1). Subunits A1 and A4 have distinct substrate selectivities and therefore the activities of the two subunits can be determined separately within the heterodimer. The kcat value for the Michael addition of glutathione to nonenal is about 700fold higher for GST A4-4 than for GST A1-126 whereas the kcat value with AD is 1000-fold greater for GST A1-1 than for GST A4-4.27 The difference between the two Alpha class enzymes is smaller

404 52 of GST A1-1 diminished the stability of the enzyme even though its tertiary structure did not seem to be affected.32 The mutant displayed only 3 % of the wild-type speci®c activity towards the electrophilic substrate CDNB due to a 50-fold increase in the KM value for glutathione. In human GST P1-1 mutational effects depended on the nature of the key-residue substitution.33 The conservative mutation Y50F increased the catalytic ef®ciency, whereas Y50L and Y50T gave similar effects as the F52S mutation in GST A1-1. In the latter two mutants the speci®c activity with CDNB was 100-fold decreased due to 160-fold reduced af®nity for glutathione. In the Y50A and Y50R mutants, however, the Vmax value instead was diminished by factors as large as 3000 and 1000, respectively. Furthermore, the R69A mutant of human GST A1-1 has a reduced af®nity for glutathione as evidenced by the decreased ability of binding to immobilized glutathione.34 The I50 value for the inhibitor and product analog S-hexylglutathione was decreased 20-fold by the R69A mutation, while kcat/KGSH was reduced 14-fold and kcat/ M KCDNB tenfold. M Compared to the two interface mutants of GST A1-1, F52S32 and R69A,34 the GST A1-4 heterodimer appears as a very ef®cient enzyme. In view of the high sensitivity of the catalytic activity to mutations in the subunit interface, both in GST A1-132,34and in GST P1-1,33 it is therefore unlikely that the differences between subunits A1 and A4 in the lock-and-key motif cause any major structural alterations in GST A1-4. Since the mouse, rat, and human A4 subunits display distinctive substrate selectivity for alkenals, it could be speculated that the GST A4-4-speci®c interface has evolved to enhance this activity. However, the A4-characteristic interface is not necessary for high alkenal activity. GST A1-1 has been engineered to catalyze the Michael addition of glutathione to alkenals with high ef®ciency.26 In the GST A1-1 mutant, GIMFhelix, none of the interface amino acid residues were mutated, but the mutant was still as ef®cient as GST A4-4 with nonenal. Hence, these ®ndings do not support the hypothesis that the GST A4-4 interface is a result of evolution towards high alkenal activity. Another possibility is that the variant A4 interface has developed to limit hybridization to other Alpha class subunits. For example, in both liver and in pancreas, the subunits of GST A1-1 and GST A2-2 are expressed in substantially larger amounts than subunit A4..35-37 If subunit A4 were to ef®ciently form heterodimers with subunits A1 and A2, most of the A4 subunits would be engaged in heterodimer formation, which for various reasons could be disadvantageous for the organism. For example, the regulation of differential GST gene expression and cellular GST compartmentalization may become jeopardized. In contrast to hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions govern the speci®city of molecular rec-

ognition, and hence the large differences in the network of electrostatic interactions between the subunits in GST A1-1 and GST A4-4 may have evolved to enhance selectivity in the subunit assembly of the Alpha class GSTs.

Materials and Methods
Expression and purification The heterodimer GST A1-4 was obtained by coexpression of the two isoenzyme subunits in E. coli BL21 (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) using the pET246HISA1 plasmid together with either pET21highA4 or pET21A4. The ®rst plasmid is a pET24-a vector (Novagen) construct with the cDNA encoding the A1 subunit inserted between the restriction sites of NdeI and SalI. In the 5H end of the cDNA, immediately following the start codon, six histidine codons (CAC) have been introduced in order to add a hexa-histidine tail to the N terminus of the A1 subunit. In the latter two vectors the cDNA for the A4 subunit20 has been ligated into pET21-a using the NdeI and SalI sites. In pET21highA4 the ®rst ten codons in the 5H -end of the cDNA have been optimized by silent mutations for ef®cient translation.21 The protein expression and the crude lysate preparations were conducted as described previously10 with some modi®cations. The expression was induced at A600 % 0.4 instead of 0.6 and the expression was continued for 4.5 hours after induction. The heterodimer was separated from the corresponding homodimers in a two-step procedure. The crude lysate was desalted and the pH was changed from 7.0 to 6.0 using PD-10 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The ®rst puri®cation step was conducted on a HiTrap SP cation-exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from which the protein was eluted using a salt (0-1 M NaCl) and pH gradient (pH 6.0-7.0). The last peak eluted contained pure GST A1-1. The enzyme was stored at À80  C. The fractions containing the heterodimer were pooled and applied on a HiTrap Chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) loaded with Ni2 and equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 M NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer and an imidazole gradient, from 20 mM to 0.5 M, was applied for elution. The pure heterodimer was concentrated using Nanosep Microconcentrators (Pall Filtron, Lund, Sweden) and stored at 4  C. The homodimer of GST A4-4 was expressed separately using the pET21high A4 vector and puri®ed by glutathione-af®nity chromatography as described.20 The purity of the enzymes was veri®ed by SDS-PAGE and IEF (pH 3.5-9.5) using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining for detection. The SDS-PAGE gel was loaded with 4 mg protein in each well and the IEF samples contained 2 mg of each protein. The subunit concentration of the different Alpha class isoenzymes was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coef®cients: 24,700 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (GST A1-1), 20,135 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (GST A1-4) and 15,930 MÀ1 cmÀ1 (GST A4-4). Characterization of the heterodimer In order to monitor the puri®cation procedure, the speci®c activities of the different fractions were measured with two electrophilic substrates: 1-chloro-2,4-

Characterization of a GST A1-4 Heterodimer dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and nonenal using the conditions described by Mannervik & Widersten.38 Additionally, the speci®c activities with CDNB and nonenal were determined under standard conditions (at 30  C) when studying the thermal stability of the various isoenzymes. GST A4-4 and GST A1-4 were incubated in a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml at 0, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60  C for 20 minutes before determining the speci®c activity with the respective substrates. With GST A1-1 the experiment was conducted only at 0, 50 and 60  C. 2 mg of each sample of the heterodimer was analyzed by IEF. A precipitate that formed in the sample incubated at 50  C was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 g. Only the supernatant was loaded on the IEF gel. The kinetic parameters of GST A1-1, GST A1-4 and GST A4-4 were determined with AD in addition to CDNB and nonenal. Concentrations of both glutathione and the electrophiles were varied in the experiments. The concentration ranges of glutathione were: 0.06255 mM (using 1.6 mM CDNB), 0.0315-2 mM (using 0.2 mM nonenal) and 0.0625-1 mM (using 0.1 mM AD). The concentrations of the electrophiles ranged between: 0.1-2 mM CDNB (using 5 mM GSH), 0.00625-0.2 mM nonenal (using 0.5 mM GSH) and 0.00625-0.1 mM AD (using 1 mM GSH). The saturation curves for CDNB and nonenal were measured in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), whereas the pH used for the AD reaction was 8.0 (0.1 M sodium phosphate). All kinetic measurements were performed at 30  C. The CDNB conjugation was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm (e340  9600 MÀ1 cmÀ1) caused by the formation of product. The nonenal conjugation reaction is measured as a decrease in absorbance at 225 nm (enonenal  19,220 MÀ1 225 cmÀ1) caused by the decrease of nonenal concentration. The product of the AD isomerization reaction, Á4-androstene-3,17-dione, absorbs at 248 nm (e248  16,300 MÀ1 cmÀ1). The different kinetic parameters were obtained by ®tting of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism1 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). In order to determine the catalytic ef®ciency, kcat/KM, the equation: v  (Vmax/KM) Â [S]/(1  [S]/KM) was ®tted to the data. Both kcat/KM and the turnover number, kcat, were calculated per protein subunit.
