Protein Ubiquitination: CHIPping Away the Symmetry

CHIP is a ubiquitin ligase implicated in the degradation of misfolded proteins. In the November 23 issue of Molecular Cell, Zhang et al. (2005) identified CHIP as a protein that interacts with the ubiquitin E2 complex Ubc13-Uev1A, which catalyzes the synthesis of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Although the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP requires its dimerization through the U box domain, the crystal structure of the CHIP-E2 complex reveals that the protomers in the CHIP homodimer adopt distinct conformations such that only one U box of CHIP interacts with Ubc13. Shortly after its discovery, the ubiquitin-proteasome system has won the reputation as the ``garbage disposal'' that degrades abnormal and misfolded proteins in the cells. Although the ubiquitin system is now known to control many physiological processes through regulating the turnover and activity of normal cellular proteins, the garbage disposal function is still one of the most vital functions of the ubiquitin system. For example, the failure to degrade abnormal proteins in neurons has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Degradation of abnormal proteins by the ubiquitin system is coordinated with the other major protein quality-control system in cells, chaperones such as the heat shock proteins (Hsps). Abnormal proteins, by virtue of exposed hydrophobic residues on their surfaces, are recognized and refolded by chaperones. If refolding fails, misfolded proteins are thought to be degraded by the proteasome. This model has received support from the recent discovery of CHIP (C-terminal of Hsp70-interacting protein), a chaperone-interacting protein that also exhibits ubiquitin ligase activity (Jiang et al., 2001; Murata et al., 2001). The primary structure of CHIP contains two functional domains: an N-terminal tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain that mediates interaction with Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperones, and a C-terminal U box (Murata et al., 2003). U boxes are structurally related to RING finger domains, except that U boxes are stabilized by hydrogen bonds instead of zinc binding. Like RING domains, U boxes are found in E3 ubiquitin ligases and bind E2 ubiquitinconjugating enzymes. Indeed, CHIP has been shown to promote ubiquitination of denatured proteins in a manner that depends on Hsp70 and Hsp90. Although several proteins have been shown to be ubiquitinated by CHIP in overexpression and in vitro experiments, the physiological substrates of CHIP remain largely unknown. CHIP knockout mice are viable but die much more quickly than wild-type mice following transient exposure to elevated temperature (42ºC), supporting the important role of CHIP in the heat shock response and prevention of apoptosis (Dai et al., 2003). Loss of CHIP leads to defective induction of Hsp70, whereas overexpression

of CHIP activates heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor that regulates Hsp protein expression in response to heat shock. It is not clear how CHIP activates HSF1 and whether this activation involves proteolysis by the proteasome. CHIP has been shown previously to function with the UbcH5 family of E2s, which can catalyze Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination that usually targets a protein for degradation by the proteasome. A new link between CHIP and ubiquitination is reported in the November 23 issue of Molecular Cell by Zhang et al. (2005), who identified CHIP as a protein that binds to the dimeric ubiquitin E2 complex Ubc13-Uev1A, which catalyzes the synthesis of a unique polyubiquitin chain linked through Lys-63 (K63) of ubiquitin. K63-linked polyubiquitination has been shown to regulate several nonproteolytic functions, including DNA repair and protein kinase activation (Sun and Chen, 2004). In vitro biochemical experiments now show that CHIP facilitates the synthesis of K63linked polyubiquitin chains by Ubc13-Uev1A. Unfortunately, neither the targets nor the physiological functions of K63-linked polyubiquitination by CHIP are known at present. Nevertheless, the finding that CHIP can function with different E2s to catalyze distinct forms of polyubiquitination raises the possibility that CHIP may have multiple functions, some of which may be independent of proteasomal degradation. How can one E3 interact with distinct E2s to synthesize polyubiquitin chains of different configurations? Insights into this question are provided, in part, by the studies of Zhang et al. (2005), who solved two crystal structures of CHIP: a structure of full-length CHIP bound to a peptide from HSP90, and a structure of the CHIP U box bound to Ubc13-Uev1A. The structures provide the first detailed view of a complex between a U box E3 and an E2, and reveal many similarities between U box and RING E3s. First, the CHIP U boxes form symmetric homodimers that structurally superimpose well with the heterodimeric complex between RING domains from BRCA1 and BARD1 (Brzovic et al., 2001). Second, the CHIP U box-Ubc13 interaction closely resembles the interactions between RING domains and other E2s (Zheng et al., 2000). In particular, a common Ser-Pro-Ala motif present in UbcH4, UbcH5, and Ubc13 mediates their interaction with the CHIP U box. This motif is absent in other E2s such as UbcH7 and E2-25K, suggesting that these E2s do not interact with CHIP. The binding of CHIP U box does not alter the structure of Ubc13Uev1A, which is very similar to the structure of yeast Ubc13-Mms2 (VanDemark et al., 2001). The Ubc13Mms2 complex harbors two potential ubiquitin binding channels that intersect at the active site of Ubc13. One channel binds the donor ubiquitin, covalently linked to Ubc13's catalytic cysteine via a thioester bond. The second channel binds the acceptor ubiquitin and positions only K63 of ubiquitin toward Ubc13's active site, thus providing the molecular basis of K63 polyubiquitin chain assembly. During polyubiquitination, the C terminus of the acceptor ubiquitin is either covalently attached directly to the target or to a lysine of the previous molecule

Model for the Eight Protein Complex between the CHIP Dimer, Two Molecules of HSP90, Uev1a, an Acceptor Ubiquitin, and the Ubc13wUbiquitin Donor Thioester Complex Two views are shown, rotated 90º about the x axis. The model is based on biochemical data and crystal structures from Zhang et al. (2005) and VanDemark et al. (2001) (PDB codes 2C2L, 2C2V, and 1JAT). The TPR, helix-turn-helix (HH), and U box domains from the two molecules of CHIP are labeled. One molecule of CHIP is shown as a red ribbon diagram, with its TPR-associated Hsp90 peptide in salmon. The second molecule of CHIP is shown as a blue ribbon diagram, with its associated Hsp90 peptide also in blue. The Hsp90 peptides are obscured in the view on the left. In the view on the right, the Hsp90 peptides are shown as sticks connected to schematic representations for the remaining HSP90 domains. Ubc13 and Uev1a are shown as orange and magenta ribbons, respectively, with Ubc13's catalytic cysteine a green sphere. The locations of the donor (light green) and acceptor (yellow) molecules of ubiquitin are based on modeling and biochemical data for the related Ubc13-Mms2 complex (VanDemark et al., 2001). In the Ubc13wubiquitin thioester complex, ubiquitin's C terminus is covalently linked to Ubc13's catalytic cysteine. Lys-63 of the acceptor ubiquitin is oriented toward Ubc13's catalytic cysteine. During polyubiquitination of a client protein, the C terminus of the acceptor ubiquitin would be covalently attached either directly to the target or to another molecule of ubiquitin in the polyubiquitin chain. In the model, the C terminus of the acceptor ubiquitin (C-term) is located far away from the two CHIP TPR domains.

of ubiquitin in the chain. It is still not clear how the binding of CHIP to Ubc13-Uev1A facilitates polyubiquitination. A fascinating aspect of the CHIP structure is an asymmetric arrangement of the two monomers in the homodimer. This is because the sequence linking the TPR and U box domains adopts different conformations (Figure 1). In both monomers, this linker region adopts an extended helix-turn-helix (HH) structure that rigidly orients the TPR and U box domains. Rigid organization between peptide binding and E2 binding domains has been seen previously in c-Cbl and SCF E3s (Zheng et al., 2000, 2002). The HH motifs from the two monomers pack together as an antiparallel four helix bundle that contributes to dimerization. However, the HH domains adopt different structures in the two monomers, leading to an asymmetric homodimeric structure. In one monomer, the HH motif comprises two long, antiparallel helices. In the other monomer, the N-terminal HH helix is broken into two halves separated by a long loop, and the second helix is shorter, with a loop in place of C-terminal half. The asymmetric structure allows the second monomer to literally stretch across the dimer interface to reach the other monomer's HH motif. The result is a striking difference in the packing between the TPR motif, the HH linkers, and the U boxes for the two monomers in the dimer. This structural difference has a functional consequence: in the heterodimer, only one U box has an exposed E2 binding surface. The structure and associated biophysical studies demonstrate that a CHIP dimer binds only one molecule of E2. This

surprising finding immediately invalidates the model suggesting that dimerization of CHIP facilitates polyubiquitination by recruiting multiple E2s to the CHIP complexes. As dimerization or oligomerization of other E3s has also been shown to greatly facilitate polyubiquitination, it would be interesting to see if the asymmetric arrangement observed in CHIP-E2 complex also applies to other E3-E2 complexes. Taken together with the previous work on Ubc13Mms2 (VanDemark et al., 2001), the new CHIP structures allow generation of a model for an eight protein CHIP2HSP902-Uev1a-ubiquitin(acceptor)-Ubc13wubiquitin (donor) complex (Figure 1). In this model, the C termini of the acceptor and donor ubiquitin molecules are located very far away from the CHIP TPR motifs, raising the question of how the first ubiquitin is conjugated to the protein substrate. This is a recurring conundrum that has been encountered in the structural studies of other E3s such as the SCF complexes (Zheng et al., 2002). Unless the formation of E2-Ub thioester or the binding of substrate to E3s induce a large conformational change, the substrate must fill in the gap between the E2 active site and the substrate docking site on E3s and position a lysine residue in the correct orientation relative to the C terminus of the donor ubiquitin. After the first ubiquitin is conjugated to the substrate, the ubiquitin may be bound to Uev1A to position K63 to accept the next donor ubiquitin from the Ubc13 active site. The elegant structure of the CHIP-Ubc13-Uev1A complex should now provide a working platform for deeper investigation into the

eIF3: A ConnecTOR of S6K1 to the Translation Preinitiation Complex

In the November 18 issue of Cell, Holz et al. (2005) discover an unidentified function for the eIF3 translation initiation factor as a scaffold for the dynamic associations of many preinitiation complex components, including the growth-regulating kinases mTOR and S6K1.

The role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6K1 signaling pathway in translational control remains, despite its considerable study, poorly understood. mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/ threonine kinase that exists in two multiprotein complexes and responds to growth factor and nutrient signals to control cell growth and survival. One of these complexes, called raptor-mTOR, phosphorylates S6K1 in a manner that is sensitive to the immunosuppressant drug rapamycin. The initial demonstration of the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on translation regulators (Beretta et al., 1996; Chung et al., 1992; Kuo et al., 1992; Price et al., 1992), and the more recent identification and characterization of the mTOR-interacting protein, raptor (Hara et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2002), have facilitated our understanding of mTOR translational signaling toward its downstream effectors, S6K1 and 4E-BP1. Lacking from the literature are mechanistic insights into how mTOR and S6K1 regulate the translation machinery during the process of protein synthesis. Holz et al. (2005) deliver many of these insights in a plentiful display of regulated and temporally defined interactions between mTOR, S6K1, S6K1 substrates, and components of the translation preinitiation complex. Their work provides

key new information on the signaling relay from mTOR and S6K1 to the initiation of mRNA translation. Although S6K1 has multiple translational targets (Hay and Sonenberg, 2004), the question of how S6K1 is localized to its substrates during protein synthesis has been largely unexplored. To address this question, Holz et al. (2005) used an affinity-based purification method to identify interactors of S6K1. This work revealed the interaction of S6K1 with several of the proteins that make up the eIF3 translation initiation factor. During the process of translation preinitiation, eIF3 associates with a large complex of proteins called the preinitiation complex (PIC), which includes the small ribosomal subunit. eIF3 is composed of 13 subunits, and, among its many functions, it is thought to play a pivotal role in tethering the PIC to the 50 cap structure of mRNA via its interaction with the eIF4F protein complex (Unbehaun et al., 2004; Gebauer and Hentze, 2004). Thus, the identification of eIF3 family members as S6K1 interactors represented a potentially important connection between the mTOR pathway and an integral component of the translational preinitiation apparatus. After confirming the interaction between endogenous S6K1 and eIF3, the authors set upon uncovering potential mechanisms that regulate this interaction. They found that multiple stimuli, including growth factors and nutrients, disrupt the association of S6K1, but not the related S6K2, with eIF3 in a rapamycin-sensitive fashion. As rapamycin treatment leads to hypophosphorylation and inactivation of S6K1, the authors reasoned that the activity of S6K1 might regulate its binding to eIF3. Indeed, mutants that eliminate S6K1 activity constitutively bind eIF3, whereas active S6K1 mutants are incapable of binding eIF3. Because the rapamycin sensitivity of the eIF3-S6K1 interaction suggested the involvement of the raptor-mTOR complex, the authors tested if these proteins might also associate with eIF3. This was
