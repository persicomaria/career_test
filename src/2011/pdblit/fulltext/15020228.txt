Structure of the InlB Leucine-Rich Repeats, a Domain that Triggers Host Cell Invasion by the Bacterial Pathogen L. monocytogenes
Michael Marino,* Laurence Braun, Pascale Cossart, and Partho Ghosh* * Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of California, San Diego La Jolla, California 92093-0314  Institut Pasteur Unite des Interactions Bacteries-Cellules ´ ´ 28 rue du Dr Roux 75015 Paris France Lingnau et al., 1995; Braun et al., 1998; Greiffenberg et al., 1998; Muller et al., 1998; Parida et al., 1998). InlA is ¨ required to induce phagocytosis in the intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 and other cell lines expressing its receptor, E-cadherin (Mengaud et al., 1996). While the importance of InlA to virulence has not been clearly demonstrated, it is undisputed that InlB is required for infection of hepatocytes and is critical for causing disease (Gaillard et al., 1996; Gregory et al., 1997). InlB induces phagocytosis through activation of phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase within host cells, leading to increased levels of phosphoinositide second messengers (Ireton et al., 1996, 1999). PI 3-kinase is involved in many signaling events, including those affecting actin polymerization (Carpenter and Cantley, 1996). Activation appears to occur through InlB-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins implicated in membrane localization of PI 3-kinase (Ireton et al., 1999). In line with these findings, inhibitor studies have shown that L. monocytogenes invasion of InlB-permissive cells requires PI 3-kinase activation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and actin polymerization (Tang et al., 1994; Ireton et al., 1996). These mammalian cell activities can be elicited by a domain of InlB that consists of the N-terminal 213 residues (24 kDa) of the mature 595-residue protein (67 kDa). This domain, which contains the LRR region of InlB, is both necessary and sufficient to activate PI 3-kinase and effect cytoskeletal changes (Braun et al., 1999). If attached to noninvasive L. innocua or to latex beads, the LRR domain also suffices to induce phagocytosis (Braun et al., 1999). To understand the mechanism by which the LRR domain of InlB causes cell invasion, we have determined its X-ray crystal structure. Most strikingly, the structure provides evidence that InlB binds calcium, and it implicates calcium as having a role in receptor interactions. The exposed manner in which the calciums are bound suggests a model in which the metal forms a bridge between InlB and its receptors. Furthermore, the structure reveals an elongated and curved molecule that exposes an extended surface containing clusters of residues that are likely to participate in forming a bacterial­mammalian signaling complex.

Summary The L. monocytogenes protein InlB activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase and induces phagocytosis in several ° mammalian cell types. The 1.86 A resolution X-ray crystal structure of the leucine-rich repeat domain of InlB that is both necessary and sufficient to induce phagocytosis is presented here. The structure supports a crucial role for calcium in host cell invasion by L. monocytogenes and supplies a rationale for its function. Calciums are bound to the protein in an unusually exposed manner that suggests that the metals may act as a bridge between InlB and mammalian cell surface receptors. The structure also identifies surfaces on the curved and elongated molecule that may constitute additional interaction sites in forming a bacterial­mammalian signaling complex. Introduction Induction of phagocytosis in nonphagocytic mammalian cells is crucial to the virulence of some intracellular pathogens, allowing escape from humoral immune responses and proliferation in protected niches (Finlay and Cossart, 1997). Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen, induces phagocytosis in several nonphagocytic mammalian cell types through the action of a bacterial surface protein, InlB (internalin B) (Cossart and Lecuit, 1998). L. monocytogenes is responsible for severe infections in humans leading to meningitis or abortion. InlB belongs to the internalin family of Listeria proteins, which includes at least nine members (Gaillard et al., 1991; Engelbrecht et al., 1996; Domann et al., 1997; Dramsi et al., 1997; Raffelsbauer et al., 1998). Internalin family members contain tandem 22­amino acid leucinerich repeats (LRRs), a motif associated with protein­ protein interactions (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1995). The cellular functions of two family members, InlA (internalin) and InlB, have been identified. Both proteins induce phagocytosis but have different cell type tropisms. InlB is required to induce phagocytosis in hepatocyte, endothelial, and certain epithelial or fibroblast-like cell lines, such as Vero, HeLa, HEp-2, or CHO (Dramsi et al., 1995;

Results Overview of the Structure The LRR domain of InlB is composed of residues 36­248 (residues 1­35 are the cleaved signal sequence). The domain was overexpressed in E. coli and purified, and ° crystals were grown that diffract X-rays to at least 1.5 A ° resolution. We have determined the structure to 1.86 A resolution using isomorphous and anomalous scattering differences (Table 1). Experimental electron density maps are of excellent quality, allowing straightforward interpretation of atomic positions. The main chain from residue 36 to 242 is within continuous electron density

as are all side chains but for a few at the surface. Highresolution diffraction has not only allowed clear visualization of the protein chain, but also revealed the importance of nonprotein atoms, specifically water molecules and calcium ions, to structure and function. The LRR domain appears to form a bowed tube (Figure 1). Its elongation and curvature arise from seven and one-half LRRs (residues 77­242) that create an extended surface area. The N-terminal end of the tube is capped by a non-LRR region (residues 36­76) to which are bound two calcium ions. N-Terminal Cap The N-terminal region, which is composed of a mixture of two short strands and three short helices (Figure 2A), forms a hydrophilic cap on the buried leucines and isoleucines of the first LRR. The cap and LRR regions

form a single structural domain. The hydrophobic core of the cap is continuous with the hydrophobic core of the LRR region, and residues in the cap region form hydrogen bonds to the LRR region. Continuity of domain structure is also supported by the observation that the cap and LRR regions are not separable by proteolysis (M. M. and P. G., unpublished results). Residues in the hydrophobic core of the cap region and those that contact the LRR region are conserved in the internalin family (Figure 2B, shaded residues), indicating that the structure of this region is likely to be similar for all internalin family members. Ions Are Calciums Two ions and most of their coordinating waters are apparent in experimental electron density maps. These ions are bound to main chain carbonyls and side chain

carboxylates in a region bracketed by the 1 and 2 helices of the cap region (Figure 2A). Several pieces of evidence, which are explained more fully in sections below, identify the ions as calciums. First, crystals were grown in the presence of 200 mM calcium. Second, the ions and their liganding waters are absent when crystals are soaked in buffers containing 20 mM EGTA and no calcium. Third, soaking in 200 mM calcium restores the ions and their liganding waters in crystals from which the ions had been first removed. Fourth, the ion at site 1 is coordinated by seven oxygens that form a pentagonal bipyramid (Figure 3A), as observed in other calciumbinding proteins (Chattopadhyaya et al., 1992). The coordination at site 2 also forms a pentagonal bipyramid, with atoms at six out of seven vertices visible (Figure 3B). Lastly, a calcium analog, samarium, is found to replace the ion at site 2. Samarium was used for heavy atom phasing and was soaked into the crystal in the presence of 200 mM calcium (Table 1). It does not displace the ion at site 1 appreciably, providing initial evidence that site 1 has a higher calcium affinity than site 2. Calcium-Binding Sites Calcium site 1 is created by a short loop connecting the 1 and 2 helices (Figures 2A and 3A). The one-turn 1 helix is interrupted by Pro-49 at which point the chain reverses direction and continues into 2. The calcium ion is liganded directly by only two protein oxygens, the main chain carbonyl of Pro-49 and the side chain carboxylate of Asp-51 (Figure 3A). Five tightly bound

waters complete the heptacoordination of this site. Along with the two direct contacts, InlB forms hydrogen bonds with three of the liganding waters. The calcium ° is well ordered, with a B factor of 17 A2, as are the liganding waters, with an average B factor identical to ° that of the protein, 21 A2. Calcium site 2 is formed by the 2 helix, and unlike site 1, all the InlB contacts come from side chains (Figures 2A and 3B). The calcium ion is liganded directly by the carboxylates of Glu-55 and Asp-59, which together form three calcium­oxygen contacts. In addition, three waters coordinate the calcium to provide a total of six ligands. Lys-58, which forms a salt bridge with Glu-55, provides an indirect contact to the calcium by hydrogen bonding to one of its liganding waters. The calcium at site 2 is more flexibly bound than the calcium at site 1, ° having more than twice its B factor (44 A2). The liganding waters at site 2 are also more flexibly bound, having an ° average B factor of 38 A2. The average calcium­oxygen ° distances are longer at site 2 than at site 1, 2.58 A as ° compared to 2.44 A. The structural evidence is consistent with site 1 providing a better calcium binding environment than site 2. Sequence comparison shows that the same four InlB side chains that form direct or indirect contacts to the calciums are not found in other internalin family members (Figure 2B). Modeling substitutions found in other family members requires substantial rearrangements in

water positions and side chain orientations. Although calcium binding in this region by other internalin family members cannot be ruled out, the current evidence supports InlB as being unique in the family as a calciumbinding protein. Calciums Are Not Structural To determine whether the calciums play a structural role, crystals that had been grown in 200 mM calcium were soaked in solutions containing 20 mM EGTA and no calcium. These experiments were carried out as soaks, since crystals that are suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments could not be grown at calcium concentrations below 200 mM but are stable in various soak conditions. Soaked crystals diffracted nearly identically to unsoaked crystals in resolution and data quality. Crystals that were soaked in EGTA showed no interpretable electron density at either site 1 or 2, indicating that the calciums are removed by this treatment. Significantly, the structure of the protein is nearly identical in the ° presence or absence of calcium (C rmsd of 0.55 A). The only shift observed is a slight change in Lys-45. This side chain points away from the calcium site in the presence of calcium (Figure 3A) and points into the site in the absence of calcium (data not shown). However, in the absence of calcium, electron density for Lys-45 is weak, and the side chain does not make any specific contacts. Further evidence for protein stability in the absence of calcium comes from the fact that the domain was purified and concentrated in the presence of EDTA and remained folded and nonaggregated. Taken together, these data support the view that the calciums do not cause conformational changes and do not play a structural role. Calcium Affinities The calcium affinity for the two sites was assessed by soaking crystals at seven different calcium ion concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 600 mM and by integrating

the electron density corresponding to the calcium positions at sites 1 and 2 at these soak conditions (Figure 3C). The integrated electron density reflects the fraction of protein molecules containing bound calciums. No differences in the protein structure were observed with varying calcium concentration. Crystals that were soaked in 0 mM calcium exhibit no interpretable electron density at either site and have integrated electron densities near the noise level. As a control, a crystal that had initially been soaked at 0 mM calcium was subsequently soaked at 200 mM calcium concentration. The calciums at site 1 and 2 are reconstituted to the electron density level of unsoaked crystals grown in 200 mM calcium (data not shown). This demonstrates that calcium binding in the crystal is reversible. The integrated electron density exhibits a dosedependent increase with calcium ion concentration. Site 1 has an apparent KD of 2 mM, while site 2 has at least a 10-fold higher apparent KD, 50 mM (Figure 3C). For reference, the physiological concentration of extracellular calcium is 1 mM (Maurer et al., 1996). The integrated electron density is lower at site 2 than at site 1, consistent with the calcium at site 2 having a higher B factor than the calcium at site 1. To test further the trends observed in the integrated electron densities, the occupancies of the calciums were refined at the various calcium concentrations. Calcium occupancies exhibit the same dose dependence as the integrated density, with half occupancy for site 1 occurring at 2 mM calcium and for site 2 around 50 mM calcium (data not shown). Calcium Specificity The specificity of the binding sites for calcium was investigated by asking whether the sites would also accommodate magnesium. Crystals were soaked at three different magnesium ion concentrations (200, 400, and 600 mM) in the absence of calcium. Only at 600 mM magnesium concentration is interpretable electron density observed. Magnesium is seen to occupy site 1 (Figure 3D),

Structure of the InlB LRR Domain 1067

while site 2 remains empty. The magnesium is liganded by the same two protein atoms that coordinate calcium. No appreciable differences in the protein structure occur ° upon magnesium binding (C rmsd of 0.40 A), but there are differences in the positions and numbers of coordinating waters (c.f. W1, W4, and W5 in Figures 3A and 3D). Four instead of five waters ligand the magnesium, which along with the two protein oxygens form a hexacoordinate tetragonal bipyramid, typical of magnesium coordination observed in other proteins (Lee et al., 1995). However, magnesium has more than twice the B ° ° factor of calcium at site 1 (39 A2 as opposed to 17 A2). In addition, the magnesium's liganding waters and protein side chain (Asp-51) are also less well ordered. The observations that magnesium binds at site 1 only at high concentration and with a high B factor are consistent with site 1 being specific for calcium over magnesium. The fact that site 2 does not bind magnesium but does bind calcium also argues for its calcium specificity. LRR Region The InlB LRR region resembles the structure observed for porcine and human ribonuclease inhibitors (RIs) (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1995; Papageorgiou et al., 1997), the U2LRR fragment of U2 snRNP (Price et al., 1998), and the RanGAP rn 1p (Hillig et al., 1999). In common with these molecules, the InlB LRR is composed of a -loop-helix-loop motif, with the strands positioned roughly parallel to the helices (Figure 1). The strands form an eight-stranded, parallel sheet that composes the concave face of the structure. The seven helices in the LRR region, which are exclusively 310 rather than helices, form the convex face of the structure. Both secondary structure elements are short, with the strands being composed of 3 residues and the 310 helices of 3­5 residues. 310 helices are more tightly wound and sterically strained than helices, and their occurrence is probably due to the short 22-residue repeat length of the InlB LRR. RI has repeats of 28 and 29 residues and contains exclusively helices, and U2LRR has repeats of 24 residues and contains both and 310 helices. The main chain of the LRR follows the path of a righthanded coil that stacks on itself, giving the structure its elongated shape. Its curvature arises from the shorter distance between adjacent strands than between adjacent 310 helices, leading to a 14 angle between LRRs. The LRRs are arranged as a right-handed superhelix, ° with a pitch of 40 A and 25.5 LRRs required to complete a turn of the superhelix. The superhelical arrangement places no obvious limits on the number of LRRs that a protein of this type may possess. Water as a Secondary Structural Element Two-thirds to three-quarters of the InlB LRR forms loops rather than regular secondary structure. Water molecules compensate by forming bridging hydrogen bonds between the main chain of adjacent LRRs (Figure 4). The waters are organized as three distinct spines along the convex face of the LRR region, and the waters in each spine have identical hydrogen bonding patterns (Figure 4, bottom). The waters are tightly bound (average ° B factor of 21.6 A2), and as many main chain atoms

Figure 4. Water Spines The convex face of the InlB LRR region faces the viewer. Waters are depicted as red spheres. The hydrogen bonding scheme is shown below, with atoms numbered by their position within the LRR. The numbering convention of the InlB LRR follows that of the RI LRR (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1995), with the strand occupying positions 4­6. The spines are named according to the first LRR position that forms a hydrogen bond with the water. Between the third and fourth repeats in Spine 15, two waters are accommodated due to a local increase in the curvature of the molecule. Gln-165 occupies the position of a water in Spine 1 between the same two repeats.

participate in water spine hydrogen bonds as participate in strand or 310 helix hydrogen bonds. The three water spines, therefore, may be considered to be an extension of the protein in mediating secondary structure. Conserved and Nonconserved LRR Positions All internalin family members have tandem LRRs that are 22 residues in length. Ten of the 22 residues in the InlB LRR play structural roles and are also conserved in the internalin family. This indicates that the structure of the InlB LRR is likely to be representative for the family as a whole. Eight of the ten conserved repeat residues are diagnostic for LRR-containing proteins. These eight are composed of seven leucines or isoleucines (at repeat positions 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 18, and 21), which form the hydrophobic core of the LRR region, and one asparagine (repeat position 10) whose role has been previously described (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1995) (Figures 5A and 5B). Briefly, the asparagine points into the interior of the repeat and hydrogen bonds to the main chain. Two of the ten conserved residues are unique to the LRR of the internalin family. The first is a surfaceexposed aspartate at repeat position 14 (Figures 5A and 5B). The aspartate appears to promote the formation of 310 helices by hydrogen bonding to the main chain nitrogens of repeat positions 15 and 16 (Figure 5A). The second is a small residue at repeat position 17 (Figures

Molecular Cell 1068

The calcium-containing cap region defines a third potential contact area. The calciums are exposed at the protein surface and as such may be responsible for directly bridging protein­protein interactions (Figures 6A and 6B). In addition, the cap region has a greater overall positive charge with calcium bound than with calcium absent. This may have an indirect effect on protein­protein interactions. Calcium site 2 is located on the concave face of the molecule (Figure 6A), which contains both the hydrophobic and negative clusters, while calcium site 1 is located on an adjoining face (Figure 6B). Discussion The structure of the InlB LRR domain provides evidence that a bacterial surface protein sufficient for host cell invasion binds divalent cations. Calcium binding by InlB is likely to be physiologically meaningful, as divalent cations have been shown to be required for adhesion by InlB to permissive host cells and to host cell surface receptors (L. B. et al., unpublished data). The requirement for divalent cations is a common theme in the uptake of bacterial pathogens through induced phagocytosis. InlA and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis invasin, which are both sufficient to induce phagocytosis in target cells of hosts (Marra and Isberg, 1996), also require divalent cations for their action. The requirement for divalent cations in InlA-mediated invasion is likely to reflect the calcium dependency of its receptor (Mengaud et al., 1996), E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein responsible for homophilic cell­ cell adhesion. Calcium ions bind between tandem domains of E-cadherin and promote its dimerization and rigidification (Nagar et al., 1996). Without calciums, E-cadherin is unable to perform its adhesive function and is prone to proteolysis. The InlA-binding site on E-cadherin has been mapped to a loop on the protein that is not directly involved in calcium binding (Lecuit et al., 1999). Additionally, sequence comparison of the N-terminal cap regions of InlA and InlB does not readily suggest that InlA binds calcium ions. Therefore, current evidence supports an indirect role for calcium in bolstering the structure of E-cadherin rather than a direct functional role at the InlA­cadherin interface. The requirement for divalent cations in Yersinia invasin-mediated invasion is likely to involve a different mechanism. The receptor for invasin is the 1 subunit of integrin heterodimers (Isberg and Leong, 1990), transmembrane glycoproteins responsible for various extracellular functions including cell­cell adhesion. Ligand binding to integrins generally depends on divalent cations, as is the case with invasin for which calcium, magnesium, or manganese is required (Shimizu and Mobley, 1993). Integrins contain EF-hand motifs that are implicated in calcium binding and a metal ion­ dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) implicated in magnesium or manganese binding (Lee et al., 1995). The role of calcium appears to be structural in maintaining heterodimerization, but the MIDAS has been suggested to form a metal bridge between integrin and its ligands, specifically through aspartates or glutamates of the ligand (Lee et al., 1995). Invasin contains an aspartate

5A and 5B), which is sterically restricted due to packing constraints imposed by an adjacent repeat. The remaining 12 repeat positions (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20, and 22) are composed of nonconserved and solvent-exposed residues. Thus, more than half the LRR is free to define protein­protein interaction surfaces.

Potential Protein­Protein Interaction Surfaces The InlB LRR domain possesses three regions that are likely candidates for mediating protein­protein interactions. The first is a cluster composed of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues that extends the length of the concave face of the molecule (Figure 6A, top). The hydrophobic residues occur at repeat positions 4 and 6, which are located on the sheet (Figures 5A and 5B). This cluster participates in a hydrophobic protein­ ° protein interaction within the crystal, burying 850 A2 of its accessible surface area. A second cluster composed of negatively charged residues exists on the same face of the molecule (Figure 6A, top). This negative cluster is composed of aspartates and glutamates from repeat positions 8 and 9 (Figure 5A and 5B). The concave faces of RI and U2LRR are both involved in protein­ protein interactions (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1995; Papageorgiou et al., 1997; Price et al., 1998), consistent with the location of these two potential interaction sites on InlB.

required for binding (Leong et al., 1995), raising the possibility that at least part of its divalent cation dependency is due to the functional role of magnesium at the invasin­ integrin interface. The structure of the InlB LRR domain also favors a metal bridging mechanism. The finding that the calciums bound to InlB do not play a structural role suggests that they may instead play a functional role. The calciums are bound in an unusual manner. Calcium-binding proteins typically provide six of the seven oxygens that coordinate calcium. In contrast, InlB provides as few as two protein oxygens to calcium coordination, and as a result, the calciums in InlB are highly exposed and available for interactions with other proteins. In effect, the calcium sites of InlB appear to be half sites that would become full sites through displacement of coordinating waters by protein oxygens of receptor molecules. There is precedence for calcium acting as a bridge between two proteins (McLaughlin et al., 1993), and metal-mediated protein­protein interactions are implicated in other cases (Garber et al., 1998; Huse et al., 1998). Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the calcium sites is that even with extensive solvent exposure, the sites are specific for calcium and have physiologically

reasonable calcium affinities. The specificity is demonstrated by the fact that magnesium binds only at high concentration (600 mM) and with a high B factor, signaling its poor fit. Apparently, neither ion-binding site is able to provide an appropriate environment for the smaller and less easily dehydrated magnesium ion. In contrast, calcium is accommodated quite well at site 1. It has a B factor lower than the protein and an apparent affinity of 2 mM, which is near the extracellular calcium ion concentration ( 1 mM) and near the affinity measured for some extracellular calcium-binding proteins (Maurer et al., 1996). Site 1 is composed of a network of direct contacts between protein oxygens and calcium and indirect contacts via hydrogen bonds from the protein to calcium-coordinating waters. Site 2 does not have such an elaborate network of direct and indirect contacts and has a lower calcium affinity ( 50 mM), although one that is probably within the range expected for a calcium half site. The structure of binding site 2 is remarkably simple and seems only to be specified by three -helical residues. Recent evidence indicates that several mammalian cell receptors may be involved in transducing a signal from InlB to the host cell interior. Among the mammalian

Molecular Cell 1070

surface proteins that bind specifically to InlB is gC1q-R, also called p32 (L. B. et al., unpublished data). The binding of InlB to gC1q-R and at least one additional as yet unidentified mammalian protein is disrupted by EDTA, providing support for the view that calcium may bridge a bacterial­mammalian signaling complex. The receptor gC1q-R does not contain a cytoplasmic domain or an obvious membrane-anchoring sequence (Ghebrehiwet and Peerschke, 1998), making it likely that it acts in concert with other receptors. The relevance of gC1q-R to InlB-mediated invasion is suggested by the observations that antibodies against gC1q-R block cell invasion and decrease PI 3-kinase activation (L. B. et al., unpublished data). Furthermore, the complement component C1q, which competes for binding to gC1q-R, is also seen to block cell invasion. The mechanism of signal transduction through gC1q-R is likely to be unorthodox, due to gC1q-R's lack of membrane attachment and due to the fact that it not only localizes to the cell surface (Eggleton et al., 1995) but also to intracellular compartments (Dedio et al., 1998). The recently determined X-ray crystal structure of gC1q-R reveals a trimeric protein containing a novel fold (Jiang et al., 1999), but it does not illuminate mechanisms of transport or cell surface attachment. The necessity to create a single or possibly multiple protein­protein interaction surfaces is well served by the structure of the InlB LRR domain. Its elongated shape provides an extended surface for protein­protein interactions that is greater in area than would be available from a globular protein of the same chain length. Furthermore, the 22-residue LRR has more than half its sequence solvent exposed and available for functional variation in defining protein­protein interaction surfaces. The curvature of the structure, which is partially stabilized by water molecules, creates a concave surface that is topographically suited for interactions with other proteins, as has been observed in structures of other LRR proteins (Kobe and Deisenhofer, 1995; Papageorgiou et al., 1997; Price et al., 1998). Residues that form hydrophobic and negative clusters on the concave face of InlB along with residues that form the calciumbinding sites warrant attention as potential hot spots for functional interactions. The structure of the InlB LRR domain provides the first step toward understanding how a bacterial­mammalian signaling complex that leads to intracellular invasion is assembled on the surface of host cells. It identifies specific surface-exposed residues of InlB that are likely to play protein interaction roles and suggests a model for the function of two unexpected and unusual calciumbinding sites in the assembly of a cell surface signaling complex.
Experimental Procedures Expression and Purification of InlB 36-248:His Residues 36­248 of InlB were cloned by PCR into pET28a (Novagen), as described previously (Braun et al., 1999), and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). Twenty-three additional N-terminal (MGSSHHHHHH SSGLVPRGSHMAS) residues are introduced by the expression strategy, resulting in InlB 36-248:His. The additional residues do not interfere with function (Braun et al., 1999). InlB 36-248:His expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG. Bacteria were lysed by sonication

(in 600 mM NaCl, 100 mM phosphate buffer [pH 8.0], 15 mM imidazole, 5 mM -mercaptoethanol), and InlB 36-248:His was purified by Ni2 chromatography (Poros MC). Polyethyleneimine was added to 0.5% to pooled fractions, the solution centrifuged, and the supernatant precipitated with 80% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The pellet was dialyzed (150 mM NaCl, 75 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) and applied to a Superdex 200 column. Purified InlB 36-248:His was concentrated to 20 mg/ml using a Centriprep 10 (calculated 280 of 9624 M 1cm 1), dialyzed (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT), and frozen at 80 C. Crystallization and Data Collection Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at room temperature using a 1:1 mixture of InlB 36-248:His and 20% PEG 8000, 200 mM Ca (CH3COO )2, 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 1 mM DTT. Crystals belong to ° ° space group P212121 with cell dimensions a 45.4 A, b 56.9 A, ° c 84.3 A. The asymmetric unit contains one protein molecule and 40% solvent. Crystals were cryoprotected in Paratone-N oil, mounted in fiber loops, and flash-cooled to 100 K (Oxford Cryostream). Oscillation data (1 ) were collected with a Mar345 detector mounted on a Rigaku FR5 generator equipped with focusing mirrors. Data were processed using Denzo/Scalepack (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) and Truncate (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) (Table 1). Phase Determination Phases were determined by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. Crystals were derivatized in harvest buffer [22% PEG 8000, 100 mM MES (pH 6.5), 200 mM Ca(CH3COO )2] supplemented with saturated ethyl mercury phosphate (12 hr), 3% saturated uranyl acetate (24 hr), 10 mM samarium chloride (3.5 days), or 5 mM cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum (5 days). SOLVE (Terwilliger and Berendzen, 1996) was used to determine and refine heavy atom parameters, and SHARP (de La Fortelle and Bricogne, 1997) was used for further refinement and phase calculation. Solvent flattening was carried out with Solomon (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Model Building and Refinement The main and side chains were built using a database of refined structures with O (Jones et al., 1991). Refinement was carried out with CNS (Brunger et al., 1998). A random 10% of data was omitted ¨ from refinement for Rfree calculations (Brunger, 1992). Refinement ¨ protocols were followed that minimized Rfree and did not allow Rfree and Rwork to diverge greatly. A maximum likelihood target was used, ° and maps were calculated with A weighting. Data less than 6.0 A resolution were bulk solvent corrected. Alternating rounds of refinement and manual rebuilding into 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc maps were carried out in seven stages, with the resolution limit being extended from ° 3.0 to 1.86 A. Each refinement round consisted of cycles of positional and restrained B factor refinement, and B factor restraints were gradually loosened. Solvent molecules and two calcium ions were ° added after refinement to 2.0 A resolution (Rfree of 29.2%, Rwork of ° 25.7%). Waters within 2.5­3.4 A of a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor were built into 4 Fo Fc density. Waters with unstable ° positions, B factors of 50 A2, or ambiguous density were removed. The final model includes InlB residues 36­242. No density is observed for additional N-terminal residues derived from the cloning strategy, or the last six C-terminal residues (243­248). All side chains are positioned in density except for five at the surface. In later refinement stages, these five were modeled, but the occupancy of disordered atoms was set to zero (atoms beyond C in Lys-64 and Glu-241, and beyond C in lysines 62, 120, and 217). All residues are in either the most favored (77.5%) or additional allowed (22.5%) regions of the Ramachandran plot. Crystal Soaking Crystals that had been grown in 200 mM calcium were placed with fiber loops into 10­20 l of soaking buffer (22% PEG 8000, 100 mM MES [pH 6.5]) supplemented with various concentrations of magnesium, calcium, or EGTA (room temperature, 12 hr). The concentration of InlB 36-248:His protein in crystalline form is 30 mM, and the maximum volume transferred into soaking buffer was 25

nl, as estimated from the size and number of crystals transferred. ° The resolution limit of soaked crystals ranged from 2.10 to 1.86 A ° (average of 2.0 A). The Rmerge of data from soaked crystals ranged from 3.7% to 7.5% (average 5.6%). The structure of the InlB LRR domain at various soak conditions was determined using the refined model described above (200 mM calcium model). Calculations of Rfree used the same set of reflections used for the 200 mM calcium model. EGTA To remove bound calciums, crystals were placed in soaking buffer containing 20 mM EGTA. Rigid body refinement of the 200 mM calcium model, including calciums and waters, yielded an Rfree of ° 26.3% (15­2.10 A). Simulated annealing omit maps were calculated ° with calcium 1 or calcium 2 and atoms within 5 A of the calcium omitted. No electron density for either of the ions or their liganding waters was observed. Calciums 1 and 2 and their liganding waters were removed from the model, and the position of Lys-45 was adjusted. Three cycles of refinement were carried out, waters were edited, and the model was subjected to a further refinement cycle. The final 20 mM EGTA model has an Rfree of 25.0% and an Rwork of 20.7%. Calcium The affinity of calcium for sites 1 and 2 was evaluated by electron density integration. Crystals were placed in soaking buffer containing 0, 2, 10, 25, 50, 400, or 600 mM Ca(CH3COO )2. Crystals were also placed in soaking buffer containing 0 mM Ca(CH3COO )2 for 1 day, then resoaked in buffer containing 200 mM Ca(CH3COO )2 for 1 day. Rigid body refinement of the 200 mM calcium model resulted in an average Rfree of 24.9% for the eight calcium soaks. Three refinement cycles were carried out. The protein did not require rebuilding, and the set of solvent atoms (not including those liganding calciums) was edited. One further refinement cycle followed, and simulated annealing omit maps were calculated as described ° in the previous section. Electron density within 1.7 A of the calcium positions was integrated with Mapman (Kleywegt and Jones, 1996). Integrated densities were placed on a common scale by normalizing to the integrated electron density of ten buried carbon atoms. The occupancies of calciums and their liganding waters were determined through four alternating cycles of positional, B factor, and occupancy refinement. The apparent KD for each site was estimated from the calcium concentration yielding half-maximal electron density. Magnesium Crystals were placed in soaking buffer containing 200, 400, or 600 mM Mg(CH3COO )2. Rigid body refinement of the 200 mM calcium model yielded an average Rfree of 26.0%. Difference maps were calculated in which both calciums and their liganding waters were omitted from phase calculation. For the 600 mM magnesium data, a magnesium ion with four coordinating waters was modeled at site 1, and three refinement cycles were carried out. The protein did not require adjustment. The set of solvent atoms was edited, and the model was subjected to one further refinement cycle. The 600 mM magnesium model has an Rfree of 23.4% and an Rwork of 21.3% (15­ ° 1.86 A).
