The GBD, DID, and DD domains comprise the N-terminal regulatory apparatus of DRFs, while the more C-terminal FH2 domain is responsible for nucleation of actin filaments. The actin assembly activity of the FH2 domain is inhibited by intramolecular binding of the C-terminal DAD segment to the DID domain, which is located within the N-terminal regulatory region (Alberts, 2001; Li and Higgs, 2005). The GBD and DID domains of mDia1 together bind RhoGTP to effect release of the DAD segment and activate formin for actin assembly (Rose et al., 2005). In the absence of Rho, the GBD subdomain is unstructured with respect to the adjacent DID domain ([Otomo et al., 2005a] and our unpublished data). The prolinerich FH1 region recruits the actin binding protein profilin (Chang et al., 1997; Evangelista et al., 1997; Imamura et al., 1997), thus providing a mechanism by which to deliver actin monomers to the growing barbed end of actin filaments (Carlier et al., 1999; Wear et al., 2000). Recent structural studies have revealed the conserved architecture of the FH2 domain (Shimada et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004) and its mode of interaction with actin (Otomo et al., 2005b), as well as the structure of the N-terminal region of mDia1 alone (Otomo et al., 2005a) and in complex with RhoC (Rose et al., 2005). In order to better understand formin regulation, we determined the structure of the autoinhibitory complex between the DID and DAD regions of mDia1. The structure reveals conserved interactions that stabilize the autoinhibited state, and by comparison with the previous Rho bound structure, it explains the mechanism of Rho activation. Rho binding and Rho-induced restructuring of the adjacent GBD domain sterically occludes the DAD binding surface. Additionally, Rho may promote release of autoinhibition by electrostaic repulsion of the bound DAD peptide.

Summary Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) regulate the nucleation and polymerization of unbranched actin filaments. The activity of DRFs is inhibited by an intramolecular interaction between their N-terminal regulatory region and a conserved C-terminal segment termed the Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD). Binding of GTP bound Rho to the mDia1 N terminus releases this autoinhibitory restraint. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the DAD segment of mDia1 in complex with the relevant N-terminal fragment, termed the DID domain. The structure reveals that the DAD segment forms an amphipathic helix that binds a conserved, concave surface on the DID domain. Comparison with the structure of the mDia1 N terminus bound to RhoC suggests that release of the autoinhibitory DAD interaction is accomplished largely by Rhoinduced restructuring of the adjacent GTPase binding subdomain (GBD), but also by electrostatic repulsion and a small, direct steric occlusion of the DAD binding cleft by Rho itself. Introduction Formin proteins nucleate new, unbranched actin filaments (Pruyne et al., 2002; Sagot et al., 2002) that are critical for many cellular processes, including cytokinesis, cell migration, and the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity (Evangelista et al., 2003; Higgs, 2005; Wallar and Alberts, 2003). Phylogenetic analysis reveals 15 formin genes in mammalian cells, which fall into 7 distinct groups (Higgs and Peterson, 2005). The Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs) are a subfamily of formin proteins that are effectors for Rho-family GTPases (Evangelista et al., 1997; Watanabe et al., 1997). Murine formin mDia1, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila Diaphanous (Castrillon and Wasserman, 1994), is a protein of 1255 residues that is required for cytokinesis (Watanabe et al., 1997), Rho-induced formation of actin stress fibers (Nakano et al., 1999), and for microtubule stabilization (Ishizaki et al., 2001; Palazzo et al., 2001). The conserved domain structure of DRFs includes, from the N terminus to the C terminus, the GTPase bind-

Results and Discussion Structure of the Autoinhibited mDia1 DID/DAD Complex We cocrystallized the DID domain (residues 131­369 of murine mDia1) with the DAD segment (residues 1175­ ° 1200) and refined the structure at 2.1 A resolution (see Table 1). The DID domain is composed of five armadillo repeats, a structural motif of three helices arrayed in a superhelical coil (Otomo et al., 2005a; Rose et al., 2005). The DAD polypeptide binds along the entire length of the domain, roughly perpendicular to the B helices, and establishes an extensive interface through numerous mainly hydrophobic contacts (Figure 1B). The core of the DAD segment is an amphipathic helix, with Gly1180 at its N terminus and Gly1192 at its C terminus, which binds to the concave surface formed by the central B helices of the five armadillo repeats.

helix is augmented by additional segments at both its N and C termini. The hydrophobic face of the DAD helix, defined by Val1181, Met1182, Leu1185, and Leu1189, packs in a shallow groove on the DID domain (Figure 1C). DAD residue Met1182 makes particularly extensive contact; it inserts into a pocket formed by a ring of hydrophobic residues on the DID domain that include Met216, Ile222, Leu253, and Ala256 (Figure 2). Each end of the DAD helix is anchored by a helix-capping hydrogen bond contributed by the DID domain; the side chains of conserved residues Asn217 and Gln352 form hydrogen bonds with the main chain amide and carbonyl groups of DAD residues Met1182 and Leu1189, respectively. Additionally, the main chain carbonyl of Asn217 forms a hydrogen bond with Gly1180 on the DAD peptide. Just N-terminal to the helix, DAD residues 1177­1179 bind in an extended conformation and make only modest contact with the DID domain. Asp1177 packs against Val168, while Thr1179 makes a hydrogen interaction via a bridging water molecule (not illustrated). On the C-terminal side of the helix, residues 1192­1196 form

a helical turn that projects perpendicular to the core helix. Residue Phe1195 in this turn inserts into a pocket formed by Ile259, Asn310, Thr314, and Val355 on the DID domain (Figure 1C). The DAD binding surface on the DID domain is highly conserved among most Diaphanous-related formins (Figure 3A). Mapping of conserved residues on the surface of the DID domain, based on aligned sequences of 30 DRFs, demonstrates that each of the 5 most highly conserved surface residues (Asn217, Asn218, Ala256, Asn310, and Gln352) participates in DAD recognition (Figure 3B). Additionally, previous structure-function studies of mDia regulation agree well with the observed structure. In mDia2, alanine substitutions in DAD residues corresponding to Ser1184, Glu1187, and Gln1190 in mDia1 have no effect on autoinhibition, while substitution in positions corresponding to Met1182, Leu1185, and Leu1189 each abrogate autoinhibition (Alberts, 2001). As shown in Figures 1C and 3B, each of the latter residues is part of the core DAD domain interaction. Similarly, previous mapping of the DAD binding site on the surface of the DID domain based on sequence conservation, site directed mutagenesis, and NMR crosssaturation experiments corresponds closely to the observed binding surface (Otomo et al., 2005a; Rose et al., 2005). Point mutations of DID domain residues Asn217, Ile222, Ala256, Ile259, and Leu260 all decrease DAD binding, and all lie within the DAD binding site (Otomo et al., 2005a; Rose et al., 2005) (Figure 1C). Relevant segments of the sequences of several representative DRFs are aligned in Figure 3C. The DID and

Figure 2. The 2jFoj 2 jFcj Composite-Omit Map Contoured at 1.0s The DID/DAD interface and, in particular, the positioning of Met1182 into a hydrophobic pocket on the DID domain (blue) is highlighted. The DAD peptide is shown in yellow.

DAD residues in the binding interface are conserved (or conservatively substituted) among most DRFs, including the mammalian formins mDia, Daam1 (Dishevelledassociated activator of morphogenesis-1), and Fmnl1 (formin-like 1) and the yeast formin Bnr1p. Based upon this sequence conservation and structural considerations, we expect that the particular autoinhibitory binding mode we observe here will be general among these DRFs. Interestingly, the binding interface is not sufficiently conserved in the mammalian FHOD1 or in the yeast Bni1p to allow us to confidently predict a closely similar autoinhibitory interaction in these proteins, despite the fact that both contain recognizable DID and DAD domains. Thus, it is possible that some Diaphanous-related formins have evolved alternative autoinhibitory mechanisms.

Calorimetric Analysis of the Autoinhibitory Interaction It is important to ask to what extent the isolated DID and DAD segments studied here recapitulate the autoinhibitory interaction in the intact protein. A dimeric mDia1 N-terminal fragment (residues 1­548) has been shown to inhibit the actin assembly activity of an FH2+DAD C-terminal construct with an IC50 of 2 nM, and to inhibit an FH2-only fragment with an IC50 of 40 mM (Li and Higgs, 2005). This DAD-independent inhibition, albeit 20,000-fold less potent, suggests the possibility of a second site of interaction on the FH2 domain proper. To further address these issues, we studied the binding of the isolated DID and DAD domains and of longer N- and C-terminal constructs by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC, Figure 4). To avoid the confounding effect of bivalent binding interactions, we used monomeric N-terminal fragments containing either the DID or GBD+DID regions. We measured binding of these constructs to a GST-DAD fusion protein and to an FH2+DAD construct. The DID domain binds with a Kd of 240 nM to the GST-DAD fusion, and with a modestly lower Kd of 102 nM to the FH2+DAD protein. The GBD region does not appear to participate significantly, as the GBD+DID

construct binds the GST-DAD with a Kd of 97 nM and to the FH2+DAD with a Kd of 57 nM. Each of these interactions is endothermic and entropically driven. The entropic nature of the binding is consistent with the hydrophobic binding interface between DID and DAD. GST alone does not interact with either DID or GBD+DID proteins (data not shown). Our measurements reveal w7-fold tighter binding to the isolated DAD domain than that reported by Rose et al. (2005), who measured binding to a longer 40 residue DAD peptide and also noted the entropically driven nature of the binding interaction. Our measurements agree well, however, with those reported by Li and Higgs (2005) for binding of longer dimeric N-terminal constructs to a similar DAD segment. Using fluorescence anisotropy, they measured a Kd of 250 nM for binding of both mDia1 1­548 and 129­548 to a FITC-labeled 25 residue DAD peptide. The similar binding affinities of the DID domain to DAD versus FH2+DAD proteins lead us to conclude that interactions between the DID and FH2 domain contribute modestly, if at all, to the affinity of the autoinhibitory interaction. This interpretation is further supported by our observation that the bound DAD peptide occupies the entire conserved surface on the DID domain. It is important to note that these experiments do not address possible interactions of the dimerization domain, and that we do not rule out the possibility of energetically neutral interactions of the DID and FH2 domains.

Mechanism of Rho Activation The activation of autoinhibited mDia1 requires the Rhoinduced displacement of the DAD domain. How is this accomplished? The GTP bound RhoA binds the GBD+DID fragment of mDia1 an order of magnitude more tightly than does the DAD segment. We measure a Kd of 9 nM by using ITC (Figure 4E), which is consistent with previously reported values determined by using stopped-flow fluorescence methods (Rose et al., 2005). The tighter binding is achieved through enthalpically favorable interactions, consistent with the numerous electrostatic interactions in the binding interface

Conservation at the DID/DAD Interface (A) Surface representation of DID, colored according to conservation among DRFs (blue to white to red with increasing conservation). Note the highly conserved patch consisting of residues Leu163, Asn217, Asn218, Ala256, Gln352, and Asn310. (B) Highly conserved residues interacting with DAD are shown in pink. Previous structure/function analysis (Alberts, 2001) of the DAD segment reveals that residues Met1182, Leu1185, and Leu1189 (red side chains) are required for autoinhibition, but that Ser1182, Glu1187, and Gln1190 are not (green side chains). (C) Multiple sequence alignment of residues at the DID/DAD interface in DRF formins. Top alignment, DID domain; bottom alignment, DAD domain. Residues involved in the autoinhibitory interaction in mDia1 are highlighted. High conservation of these residues in all mDia formins as well as mammalian Daam1 and Fmnl1 (also called Frl) and yeast Bnr1p points to a similar mechanism of autoinhibition in these formins. Yeast Bni1p and mammalian FHOD1, on the other hand, exhibit more sequence diversity. (A­D) The DID or GBD+DID protein was injected into either GST-DAD or FH2+DAD, as indicated, and binding constants were determined. Note that all titrations are endothermic, and that they yield modest variation for the dissociation constant; the longest construct has the tighter binding constants, and the shortest construct has the weaker binding constants. The apparent fraction of active protein is less than 100%, likely due, in part, to a small amount of proteolytic cleavage of the DAD peptide from the GST-DAD and FH2-DAD proteins. (E) Rho-GTP was injected into GBD-DID protein. The interaction is exothermic, and the calculated dissociation constant is an order of magnitude tighter than that of the autoinhibitory DID/DAD interaction. This higher-affinity binding of Rho-GTP is consistent with its ability to induce dissociation of the DAD segment and thereby activate the formin.

between Rho and mDia1 (Rose et al., 2005). Thus, the higher-affinity GTP bound Rho can out-compete the DAD segment for binding to the DID domain if their binding sites significantly overlap. Indeed, previous studies that mapped the DAD binding site indicated partial overlap with the Rho-interacting surface and led to this

The mDia1 GBD is shown in red, the DID is shown in blue, and the DD is shown in pink on one side of the dimer, and Rho is shown in green. The other subunit of the dimer is shown in gray. The DAD binding region is encircled, and it is displayed in detail in (B) and (C). (B) The autoinhibitory DID/DAD complex is shown superimposed on the Rho complex. The DAD domain is shown as a yellow stick model with a transparent surface. Note the steric clashes primarily between the GBD domain and DAD. Also note the possibility of electrostatic repulsion between two acidic residues, Glu64 and Asp65, in the switch II region of Rho and acidic residues, Asp1183 and Glu1187, on the exposed surface of the DAD helix. (C) Close-up view demonstrating the steric occlusion of the DAD binding site in the Rho complex. Note that GBD residues 92­97 and Rho residue Arg68 clash with the N-terminal portion of the

hypothesis (Otomo et al., 2005a; Rose et al., 2005). The present structure allows us to directly compare the binding sites of Rho versus the DAD segment on the surface of the DID domain. The structure of the mDia1 N terminus in complex with RhoC is shown in Figure 5A (Rose et al., 2005), and the present DAD complex is shown superimposed with this structure in Figures 5B and 5C. Surprisingly, only one residue in RhoA directly impinges on the DAD binding site. Arg68 is located in the switch II region of Rho, and its side chain inserts between the GBD and the first armadillo repeat of the DID domain, where it hydrogen bonds with Asn217. Although the steric clash of Arg68 is modest (it would directly clash with the side chain of Thr1179 in the DAD peptide), the introduction of this residue into the DAD binding cleft is likely to be mechanistically significant because it would preclude Asn217 from making the helix-capping hydrogen bond with the DAD peptide. We also note that two acidic residues in the switch II region of Rho (Glu64 and Asp65) ° project within 3.5­5 A of acidic residues on the exposed surface of the DAD helix (Asp1183 and Glu1187, Figure 5B). Thus, electrostatic repulsion may also contribute to expulsion of the DAD segment. More strikingly, a 6 residue segment of the GBD subdomain (residues 92­97) in the Rho complex sterically occludes the binding surface of residues 1177­1180 of the DAD domain (Figure 5). In the absence of Rho, the GBD region is not rigidly structured ([Otomo et al., 2005a] and our unpublished data), and, therefore, it does not affect binding of the DAD domain (Figure 4). Rho binding rigidifies the GBD and locks it into position in apposition with the adjacent DID domain, where it directly occludes this portion of the DAD binding site (Figures 5B and 5C). The use of an unstructured or ``contingently folded'' segment (the GBD in this case) is a common feature in the release mechanism of ras-family GTPase effectors (Lei et al., 2000). The CRIB motif of the p21-activated kinase PAK1 is perhaps the best-characterized example (Jaffer and Chernoff, 2002; Lei et al., 2000, 2005; Parrini et al., 2002; Morreale et al., 2000). This construction has been proposed to provide an ``access point'' for initial contact of the activated GTPases (Otomo et al., 2005a). In mDia1, the available structural data are consistent with a model in which GTP bound Rho could first interact weakly with the GBD alone and, in a second step, induce the reorientation of the GBD and insertion of Arg68 to effect ejection of the bound DAD peptide (Otomo et al., 2005a; Rose et al., 2005). A simpler model is also plausible; Rho might exploit transient dissociation of the weaker binding DAD segment and bind in a single step to preclude reassociation of the autoinhibitory DAD domain. Further structure-function studies will be required to discriminate between these models. For example, judicious mutation of Arg68 might maintain all binding interactions of Rho with the GBD, but diminish Rho interaction with the DID domain and thereby allow trapping of the ternary complex with Rho and DAD both bound to the mDia N terminus-- if indeed such an intermediate is relevant to formin activation. Although active RhoA is able to completely
superimposed DAD peptide. Thus, binding of Rho and the concomitant restructuring of the GBD domain preclude simultaneous binding of the autoinhibitory DAD segment and promote mDia activation.

Structure 262

displace DAD bound to the isolated mDia1 N terminus in a competition assay (Rose et al., 2005), Rho appears to only partially relieve DAD-mediated autoinhibition of actin assembly in vitro (Li and Higgs, 2005). This observation suggests the possibility that other proteins or mechanisms might also be involved in activation of DRFs. The oligomeric state of formins has not been definitively established, but the intact protein is likely to be at least dimeric, as both the N-terminal region and the FH2 domain form stable dimers. Thus, we anticipate a bivalent interaction between the dimeric N-terminal region and the C-terminal DAD domain. Because the DAD domain lies w40 residues beyond the end of the FH2 domain, the available structures provide little insight into how the DID/DAD interaction may inhibit the function of the FH2 domain. Elucidation of this issue will require structural analysis of larger N- and C-terminal fragments or of an intact formin.
Experimental Procedures Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization The DNA sequence encoding residues 1174­1200 of mDia1 was amplified by PCR and ligated into a modified pET vector containing a GST tag with a TEV cleavage site. Expression of the fusion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was induced by IPTG and was allowed to proceed overnight at 23ºC. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, and 200 mg/ml lysozyme and were stored at 280ºC. Upon thawing and after the addition of 1 mM PMSF and 2 mM TCEP, the cells were lysed by sonication and cleared by centrifugation. GST-Sepharose equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Tris [pH 8], 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP) was added to the cleared lysate. After gentle rocking for 30 min at room temperature, the beads were washed with buffer A, followed by buffer A plus 400 mM NaCl, and once again with buffer A. To form the DID/ DAD complex, purified DID protein was added to the bound GSTDAD protein and allowed to mix for 30 min at room temperature. Excess, unbound DID was removed by extensive washing with buffer A. The DID/DAD complex was cleaved from the column by overnight incubation at room temperature with TEV protease. The freely eluted DID/DAD complex was collected, concentrated, and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex75) equilibrated with buffer A. The DID/DAD complex was concentrated to 13.1 mg/ml and was stored at 280ºC. The DID/DAD complex was crystallized at 20ºC by hanging-drop vapor diffusion against 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 6.0) and 200 mM ammonium sulfate salt with 25% PEG 4000 as precipitant. Crystals grew overnight and were cryo-protected with 20% glycerol in drop mother liquor prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Crystals be° long to the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 102.15 A, ° ° b = 65.79 A, c = 46.86 A and contain a single complex in the asymmetric unit. Crystallographic Data Collection and Structure Determination Diffraction data were collected in house on a Rigaku RU300-RC rotating anode X-ray generator with osmic confocal Max-Flux (CMF12-38Cu6) optics and a Mar345dtb image plate area detector, and they were processed with XDS (Kabsch, 1993). Structure determination by molecular replacement was implemented with PHASER (CCP4, 1994; Otwinowski and Minor, 1997) by using the DID domain portion of the mDia1 N terminus as the search model (Otomo et al., 2005a). The correct solution yielded a log (likelihood) gain of 249.631 ° in the 10­3.2 A resolution range for the mDia1 DID/DAD construct. The program Arp-Warp was used to build from the molecular replacement model in an automated fashion (Brunger et al., 1998; Lamzin and Wilson, 1997), and repeated rounds of manual refitting and crystallographic refinement were performed in COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004), CNS v1.1 (Brunger et al., 1998), O (Jones and Kjeldgaard, 1997), and Refmac1 (CCP4, 1994). The final model contains residues 135­367 of DID (with a gap between residues 194­ 198), residues 1177­1196 of the DAD domain, and 126 water mole-

cules, and it has been refined to an R value of 21% (Rfree = 28%) with excellent stereochemistry (Table 1). Very low-resolution data ° (>8 A) were excluded from the refinement due to poor scaling (even after application of bulk solvent correction). Isothemal Titration Calorimetry Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments were performed by using a high-precision VP-ITC system (Microcal, Inc.). The GST-tagged DAD fragment (residues 1175­1200) or the FH2-DAD protein (residues 736­1200) was titrated with either DID (residues 131­369) or GBD-DID protein (residues 72­369). As a control, DID was also titrated into GST protein alone. All protein solutions were prepared by dialysis against 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM sodium chloride, and 2 mM TCEP overnight at 4ºC. Protein concentrations were determined by using a Coomassie binding assay (with BSA as standard) and confirmed by comparing the values with their absorbance at 280 nm by using theoretical extinction coefficients in guanidine hydrochloride. The final concentrations of protein for each experiment as shown in Figure 4 is as follows: Figure 4A, [DID] = 500 mM, [GST-DAD] = 80 mM; Figure 4B, [GBD-DID] = 176 mM, [GST-DAD] = 20 mM; Figure 4C, [DID] = 200 mM, [FH2-DAD] = 20 mM; Figure 4D, [GBD-DID] = 176 mM, [FH2-DAD] = 20 mM; Figure 4E, [GBD-DID] = 176 mM, [RhoA] = 20 mM, [GTP] = 50 mM, for the injectant and cell content, respectively. Given the binding constant of 100­200 nM for the DID/DAD interaction, these concentrations would yield a C value of 200­300 for the titrations (C = [protein in cell]/Kd), which is within the acceptable range for isothermal titration calorimetry. All protein samples were degassed for 20 min prior to use. The heat evolved after each injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The GBD-DID or DID protein was titrated into the GST-DAD or FH2-DAD protein, and Rho-GTP was titrated into GBD-DID. All titrations were conducted at 20ºC, and the volume in all cases was 10 ml per injection Analysis of the data was performed by using the ITC module of the Origin software (OriginLab Corp.).
