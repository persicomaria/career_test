Abstract Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG; UNG) has been purified 17 000-fold from Atlantic cod liver (Gadus morhua). The enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa, as determined by gel filtration, and an isoelectric point above 9.0. Atlantic cUNG is inhibited by the specific UNG inhibitor (Ugi) from the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage (PBS2), and has a 2-fold higher activity for single-stranded DNA than for double-stranded DNA. cUNG has an optimum activity between pH 7.0­9.0 and 25­50 mM NaCl, and a temperature optimum of 41°C. Cod UNG was compared with the recombinant human UNG (rhUNG), and was found to have slightly higher relative activity at low temperatures compared with their respective optimum temperatures. Cod UNG is also more pH- and temperature labile than rhUNG. At pH 10.0, the recombinant human UNG had 66% residual activity compared with only 0.4% for the Atlantic cUNG. At 50°C, cUNG had a half-life of 0.5 min compared with 8 min for the rhUNG. These activity and stability experiments reveal cold-adapted features in cUNG. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG; UNG) catalyses the hydrolysis of the N-glycosylic bond between the deoxyribose sugar and the base in uracil containing DNA, and was first isolated and characterized from Escherichia coli (Lindahl, 1974). This is the first step in the base excision repair

(BER) pathway of removing uracil from DNA (Lindahl, 1979), and the apyrimidinic site generated is thereafter repaired by an AP endonuclease, phosphodiesterase, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase in the BER pathway (Kubota et al., 1996). Several classes of UDGs have been described. The major cellular form of UDG in human cells is UNG encoded by the UNG gene (Slupphaug et al., 1995). Other classes consist of cyclin-like human UDG2 (Muller and Caradonna, 1991), single strand selective monofunctional UDG (SMUG1) from human and Xenopus lae6is (Haushalter et al., 1999), G/T:U-specific mismatch DNA glycosylase (MUG) isolated from E. coli (Barrett et al., 1998), and Thermotoga maritima UDG (TMUDG; Sandigursky and Franklin, 1999).

Human UNG is a monomeric protein of about 25 ­ 35 kDa in mass. It is not dependent on any cofactors and is highly conserved among different species (Krokan et al., 1997). UDG is, however, affected by ionic strength. It has been shown to act both in a processive `sliding mechanism', where it locates sequential uracil residues prior to dissociation from the DNA, and a distributive `random hit' mechanism (Higley and Lloyd, 1993; Purmal et al., 1994; Bennett et al., 1995). UDG has previously been isolated and characterized from rat liver (Domena and Mosbaugh, 1985), human cells and tissues (Wittwer and Krokan, 1985; Wittwer et al., 1989), calf-thymus (TalpaertBorle et al., 1979), slime mold (Guyer et al., 1986), yeast (Crosby et al., 1981), wheat germ (Blaisdell and Warner, 1983), prokaryotes (Lindahl, 1974; Cone et al., 1977; Williams and Pollack, 1990; Sobek et al., 1996; Purnapatre and Varshney, 1998) and viruses (Winters and Williams, 1993; Focher et al., 1993). In human and rat, both mitochondrial- and a nuclear UDG have been isolated (Domena and Mosbaugh, 1985; Caradonna et al., 1996). In human and mouse cells, these two are encoded by the same gene, UNG (Nilsen et al., 1997). By using two different transcription start sites and alternative splicing, two forms are generated differing only in the N-terminal signal sequence, which targets the enzyme to the nucleus (UNG2) and mitochondria (UNG1), respectively (Nilsen et al., 1997). Recently, several studies have been performed to further study the N-terminal signal sequences and the targeting of UNG to the nucleus and mitochondria (Bharati et al., 1998; Otterlei et al., 1998), and the nuclear UNG2 is found to be phosphorylated (Muller-Weeks et al., 1998). The crystal structures of UDG from man, herpes simplex virus and E. coli have been solved (Mol et al., 1995; Savva et al., 1995; Ravishankar et al., 1998). The active site residues are conserved and the mode of action in these enzymes seems to be the same with a nucleotide flipping mechanism to remove uracil from DNA (Parikh et al., 1998). Enzymes from cold-adapted organisms, such as the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), have to compensate for the reduction of chemical reaction rates at low temperatures to maintain sufficient metabolic activities. This can be achieved by higher transcription/translational levels, or improved catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM). Higher catalytic efficiencies can be reached by a more flexible

structure, compared with their warm-adapted counterparts, providing enhanced ability to undergo conformational changes during catalysis. The reduced stability to pH, temperature and denaturing agents is regarded as a consequence of a higher conformational flexibility (Feller and Gerday, 1997). In this paper, we describe the purification and characterization of a heat-labile UDG from a cold-adapted organism, and represent the first UNG purified and characterized from a teleostian species. The enzyme has similar characteristics, as previously described UDGs, with respect to molecular weight, isoelectric point, pH and NaCl optimum. However, the cod enzyme is more pHand heat-labile and has a higher relative activity at low temperatures, compared to the recombinant warm-adapted human UNG.

401

UK). Before homogenization, the following protease inhibitor mix was added to the extract buffer, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM pepstatin, 1 mM leupeptin, 10 mM TPCK and 10 mM TLCK (final concentrations). The homogenate was centrifuged at 28 000×g for 15 min and the supernatant was filtered through glass wool. Finally, glycerol was added to 30% (v/v), and the cod liver crude extract was frozen at - 70°C.

containing fractions were pooled (fraction 5, 70 ml).

2.2.2. Q-Sepharose Fast Flow One liter crude extract was diluted with 1 l buffer A (25 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0 (fraction 1). The sample was applied in two portions (1 l each) on a Q-Sepharose FF column (5.0/15), equilibrated with buffer A, and then washed with 250 ml buffer A, using a flow-rate of 10 ml/min. Proteins bound to the column were eluted with 200 ml buffer A+1.0 M NaCl, and the column was re-equilibrated with buffer A before the next part of the sample was applied, as mentioned above. The UNG-containing eluate and wash fractions from both two runs were pooled (fraction 2, 2340 ml). 2.2.3. S-Sepharose Fast Flow Fraction 2 was applied to an S-Sepharose FF column (1.6/10) equilibrated in buffer A, flow rate 10 ml/min. The column was washed with 300 ml buffer A+60 mM NaCl, and eluted using a 200 ml linear gradient of 0.06 ­ 0.4 M NaCl in buffer A, flow rate 5 ml/min. UNG-containing fractions were pooled (55 ml) and dialyzed overnight against buffer A (fraction 3). 2.2.4. Heparin Sepharose HP Fraction 3 was applied to a Heparin Sepharose HP Hi-Trap column (1.6/2.5) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 50 ml buffer A+60 mM NaCl and was eluted in a 50 ml linear gradient of 0.06 ­ 0.4 M NaCl in buffer A, flow rate 1 ml/min. UNG-containing fractions were pooled (fraction 4, 20 ml). 2.2.5. Poly-U-Sepharose (4B) Fraction 4 was then diluted five times in buffer A, and applied to a Poly-U-Sepharose column (1.6/10) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with 60 ml buffer A+ 60 mM NaCl and was eluted in a 200 ml linear gradient of 0.06 ­ 0.4 M NaCl in buffer A, flow rate 1 ml/min. UNG-

2.2.6. Superdex 75 Fraction 5 was concentrated to 200 ml using Ultrafree 15 and Ultrafree-MC ultracentrifugation filters (Millipore), cutoff 5K, and applied on a Superdex 75 column (HR 1.0/30) equilibrated in buffer A, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions (350 ml) were collected, and those containing UNG-activity were pooled (fraction 6, 3 ml). 2.3. Preparation of substrate by nick-translation
H-dUMP DNA was prepared by nick-translation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The nick-translated substrate was made up in a total volume of 1 ml and contained 50 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.2, 250 mg calf-thymus DNA (purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitated, prior to use), 0.1 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dUTP, where 2.6 mM of the dUTP was [3H]-dUTP (19.3 Ci/ mmol). The reaction was initiated by adding 0.1ng (5.35× 10 - 4 U) DNase I (bovine pancreas, Promega), and 30 s later 25 U of E. coli DNA polymerase. The nick-translation mix was incubated at 21°C for 24 h. The nick-translated DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in 50 ml TE-buffer and purified using an NAP-5 column (AP Biotech) equilibrated in TE-buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to remove unincorporated nucleotides. Specific-activity of the nick-substrate was 1.8 × 105 dpm/mg DNA (425 cpm/pmol uracil).

2.4. Preparation of substrate by PCR
The PCR-produced substrate was used for all characterization experiments and consisted of a 761 bp fragment generated from cationic trypsinogen (sstrpIV) from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (Male et al., 1995). The PCR was carried out in a volume of 50 ml in a Perkin Elmer Cetus thermocycler. The PCR-mix contained 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.37 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dUTP, where 10.2 mM of dUTP was [3H]-dUTP (17.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham), 700 pg template DNA (sstrpIV in a pgem7zt-vector), 2.5 mM of upstream and downstream primers and 2 U Taq-polymerase (Roche,

Switzerland). The PCR-reaction was performed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 45°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min. Then, an additional 2 U of Taq-polymerase was added and the PCR-reaction continued with 30 new cycles, as described above. The PCR-substrate was purified with QIAquick PCR-purification kit (Qiagen), as described by the manufacturer, and eluted in 50X diluted TEbuffer, pH 8.0. Specific-activity of the PCR-substrate was 5.9× 105 dpm/mg DNA (451 cpm/pmol uracil). All characterization experiments were done using the PCR-substrate.

ml/min, and activity was measured in the fractions collected (250 ml). Bovine serum albumin (BSA, 67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) were used as standards. Blue dextran and sodium chloride were used to determine void(V0) and intrinsic volume (Vi), respectively.

2.8. Protein determination
Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (1976) with the microtiter plate protocol, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard.

2.5. Detection of UNG acti6ity (standard assay)
UNG activity was measured in a final volume of 20 ml, containing 70 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mg/ml BSA, pH 8.0 and 230 ng nick-substrate or 71 ng PCR-substrate. The reaction mixture was incubated 10 min at 37°C, and terminated with the addition of 20 ml of ice-cold single-stranded calf-thymus DNA (1 mg/ ml) and 500 ml 10% (w/v) TCA. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 16 000×g for 10 min. Supernatants containing acid-soluble 3H-uracil were analyzed using a liquid scintillation counter. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 nmol of acid-soluble uracil per minute at 37°C.

2.9. Isoelectric point determination
Isoelectric point determination was done with the Phast-system, isoelectric focusing gel 3­9 and silver-stained according to methods described by the manufacturer. Standards used were phycocyanin (pI 4.45, 4.65, 4.75), b-lactoglobulin B (pI 5.10), bovine carbonic anhydrase (pI 6.00), human carbonic anhydrase (pI 6.50), equine myoglobin (pI 7.00), human hemoglobin A (pI 7.10), human hemoglobin C (pI 7.50), lentil lectin (pI 7.8, 8.0, 8.2), cytochrome c (pI 9.6, IEF standards pI range 4.45­9.6, Bio-Rad). After focusing, the gel was cut into 2 mm pieces and incubated in 250 ml extraction buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0) overnight. Activity was measured using standard assay conditions.

2.6. Analysis of assay products with thin layer chromatography
Reaction products after assays were mixed with 20 nmol uracil, deoxyuridine and deoxyuridinemonophosphate. Thin layer chromatography was performed according to the method by Wang and Wang (1967), using polyamide layer plates (BDH), and tetrachloromethane, acetic acid and acetone (4:1:4, by volume) as solvent. Spots detected under UV-light were cut out of the plate and radioactivity measured in a liquid scintillation counter.

2.10. Determination of pH/NaCl-optimum
Assays were done in a volume of 20 ml, as described in standard assay using the PCR generated substrate and NaCl concentration from 0 to 200 mM with 25 mM intervals, and pH ranging from 9.5 to 6.5 with 0.5 pH unit intervals. All buffers contained 100 mg/ml BSA and 1 mM EDTA. The buffers used were diethanolamine/ HCl (pH 9.5­8.5), Tris/HCl (pH 8.5­7.5) and MOPS/NaOH (pH 7.5­6.5). All buffers were pHadjusted at 37°C and used in 25 mM concentration in the assay.

2.7. Molecular weight determination
The molecular weight was determined by gel filtration, and was performed with a Superdex 75 column (1.0/30) equilibrated in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris/HCl, 1.0 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0. The flow rate was 0.5

2.11. Determination of temperature optimum
Assays were performed in a volume of 20 ml, as described in standard assay using the PCR-gener-

ated substrate. The assay mixtures were as described in standard assay conditions and were adjusted to pH 8.0 for all temperatures. The temperature range used was 5 ­ 60°C. The activity was measured in a sequential manner with 15 min intervals between each temperature. The enzymes used were diluted in standard dilution buffer (5 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0) and placed on ice. Due to the instability of the enzyme sample on ice over a prolonged period, results were corrected with respect to the stability of the enzymes incubated in dilution buffer on ice, with the formula N(t) =cpm/ e - 0693(t/u), where half-life (u) of cUNG and rhUNG are 2.0 and 2.6 h, respectively.

2.14. Ugi and uracil product inhibition
Activity measurements using PCR-substrate were performed with 6.65× 10 - 4 U of purified cUNG. Various concentrations of uracil (0, 1, 2 and 5 mM) or Ugi (1.25×103 ­2.00× 102 U) were added to the assay mixtures (on ice). Activity was then measured, as described under standard assay conditions.

3. Results

3.1. Purification of cUNG
cUNG was purified 17 000-fold with a recovery of 2%, as shown in Table 1. Despite the high purification factor, the enzyme was only partly purified as determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDSPAGE). The yield was low due to many chromatographic steps and the concentration step of the dilute protein sample prior to the gel-filteration step.

2.12. Effect of pH and temperature on stability 2.12.1. pH UNG (0.01 U) was preincubated (in a total volume of 75 ml) for 10 min at 37°C in buffers containing 10 mM buffer, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) glycerol, with pH ranging from 10.0 to 5.5 with 0.5 pH unit intervals using piperazine/HCl (pH 10.0 ­ 9.5), diethanolamine/HCl (pH 9.5­8.5), Tris/HCl (pH 8.5 ­ 7.5), MOPS/ NaOH (pH 7.5­6.5) and MES/NaOH (pH 6.5 ­ 5.5) as buffer components. All buffers were pH-adjusted at 37°C. Aliquots of 5 ml were transferred to the assay mixtures and residual activity was measured using standard assay conditions. 2.12.2. Temperature UNG (0.01 U) was preincubated (in a total volume of 75 ml) in 10 mM Tris/HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) glycerol, pH 8.0 (adjusted at each temperature). After different time-intervals, as indicated in figure legends, 5 ml aliquots were transferred to the assay mixtures and residual activity was measured using standard assay conditions. 2.13. Substrate specificity against ss/ds DNA

3.2. Molecular mass and pI-determination
The molecular mass was determined by gel filtration to be 25 kDa 9 2 (S.D.) from three separate experiments. The isoelectric point determination was done with an IEF Phast Gel with IEF standards, ranging from 4.45 to 9.6. Following IEF, cUNG activity was eluted from the gel fragments and activity measured as described in Section 2. The cUNG activity eluted from the gel was in the same region as the focusing of the cytochrome c standard, which has an isoelectric point, 9.6 as shown in Fig. 1. The cytochrome c and the cUNG activity were found where the electrode contacted the gel; therefore, we can only conclude that the pI is larger than 9.0, which is the highest measurable value using this system.

3.3. Substrate specificity
PCR and nick-translated substrate was incubated 3 min at 100°C and thereafter rapidly cooled on ice to generate ssDNA. Following denaturation, the ssDNA-substrates were used in standard assay conditions with 6.65× 10 - 4 U purified cUNG, and compared with the dsDNA PCR- and nick-generated substrates. cUNG activity was measured using both ssDNA and dsDNA. A 1.8- and 1.9-fold higher activity for ssDNA than dsDNA was found using nick- and PCR substrates, respectively, as shown in Table 2. Assay products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography, and the major part of the

Fig. 1. pI determination of Atlantic cUNG. Following the isoelectric focusing using Phast Gel IEF 3­9, the gel was cut in pieces of 2 mm. Each piece was transferred to an eppendorf tube and incubated overnight in extraction buffer at 4°C. Activity was then measured, as described in Section 2. Standards are shown from the IEF-gel.

radioactivity was identified as uracil. However, some radioactivity was also co-localized with the deoxyuridine marker, but this could be due to the partial overlap of the two markers. In addition, the purified cUNG did not exhibit any significant hydrolysis of 3H-adenine-labeled DNA, therefore excluding nucleases as responsible for hydrolyzing the DNA.

3.4. Inhibition studies
Product inhibition by free uracil was examined and given more than 50% inhibition with 1 mM uracil in the assay mixture, as shown in Fig. 2a. Adding 5 mM free uracil to the assay mixture, a 78% inhibition of the activity was observed. The effect of Ugi on cUNG was measured by adding Ugi to the assay mixture. cUNG was clearly inhibited by Ugi, as shown in Fig. 2b.

Fig. 2. (a) Product inhibition of cUNG with free uracil. Different concentrations of uracil was added to the assay mixture and the assay performed, as described in Section 2; (b) Inhibition of cUNG with the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage Ugi. 6.65 × 10 - 4 U of cUNG was incubated with 1.25 × 103 ­ 2.00 ×102 U of Ugi using standard assay conditions, as described in Section 2. One unit of Ugi inhibits one unit of UNG-activity, where the UNG-activity is defined as releasing 60 pmol of uracil per min at 37°C.

3.5. pH and NaCl optimum
The pH and sodium chloride optimum was examined by measuring the enzyme activity at

different pHs and NaCl concentration from 0 to 200 mM, as shown in Fig. 3. The enzyme exhibited a broad pH-optimum, with maximal activity between pH 7.0­9.0, and 25­50 mM NaCl. A shift in NaCl optimum was observed, where the optimum NaCl concentration changed from low concentrations at high pH to higher concentrations at low pH. At pH 9.5, cUNG was inhibited by NaCl.

3.6. Temperature optimum
The temperature optimum of cUNG was 41°C. To compare the activity of cUNG with the warmadapted recombinant human UNG (rhUNG) at low temperatures, enzyme activity was measured from 5 to 60°C, and the activity at low tempera-

Fig. 3. pH- and NaCl-optimum of cUNG. Activity of cUNG was measured with 0 ­ 200 mM sodium chloride in different pH-series, as described in Section 2. The per cent UNG activity is set relative to the highest value measured, at pH 7.5 with 50 mM NaCl.

Fig. 5. pH stability of Atlantic cUNG and recombinant rhUNG. In the different pH-buffers, 0.01 U of cUNG ( ) or rhUNG (
) were incubated for 10 min at 37°C. Then, 5 ml aliquots were transferred to the assay mixture, and residual activity was measured using standard assay conditions as described in Section 2. One hundred percent activity was measured directly from a sample diluted at pH 8.0 without any incubation step.

3.7. Stability
tures compared with their respective optimum temperatures (Fig. 4). The activity profile of these two enzymes showed little difference at 5 ­ 15°C. However, at temperatures from 20 to 40°C, a higher relative activity was observed with cUNG than rhUNG, whereas at high temperatures (50 ­ 60°C), the opposite was observed. The stability of the two UNG enzymes was compared by preincubating the enzymes at different pHs. Atlantic cUNG was shown to be most stable between pH 7.0 and 8.5. At pH 5.5 and 10.0, it had less than 1% residual activity. rhUNG was most stable between pH 7.0 and 9.5. At pH 5.5, only 3% residual activity remained but at pH 10.0, as much as 66% of the activity remained, as shown in Fig. 5. The temperature stability of the two UNG enzymes was compared at 4, 25, 37 and 50°C (Fig. 6). At 50°C, the half-life was determined to be 0.5 and 8 min for cUNG and rhUNG, respectively. At all temperatures examined, rhUNG was more stable than cUNG. Halflives determined were 20 (37°C) and 6 (25°C) min and 2 h (4°C) for cUNG and 30 (37°C) and 150 (25°C) min and 2.6 h (4°C) for rhUNG.

4. Discussion

4.1. Purification and molecular weight
Fig. 4. Temperature profile of cUNG ( ) and rhUNG (
). Enzyme activity was measured as described in Section 2. The percent UNG activity is set relative to the highest value for cUNG (45°C) and rhUNG (50°C), respectively. Due to the prolonged incubation of the enzyme samples on ice during the experiment, activity is corrected with respect to the stability of the enzymes, as described in Section 2.

The UNG from Atlantic cod liver (G. morhua) was purified about 17 000-fold using several chromatographic techniques. Still, the enzyme was only partly purified, as several other bands were observed on an SDS-PAGE gel. Human nuclear-

and mitochondrial UDG are shown to be generated by alternate splicing, and have an ORF of 313 and 304 amino acids, respectively (Nilsen et al., 1997). The molecular mass of cUNG was determined to 25 kDa. This is approximately the same molecular mass as the UNG purified from human placenta (29 kDa, Wittwer et al., 1989) and the rhUNG (UNGD84, 27 kDa), which lacked 77 and 84 of the first N-terminal amino acids, respectively, as predicted from the mitochondrial ORF (Slupphaug et al., 1995). This suggests that the N-terminal signal sequence in the purified cUNG is processed or artificially cleaved during purification or that Atlantic cUNG lacks an N-terminal signal sequence. During purification, we did not see any sign of two different UNGs as previously described during purification of UNG from rat or human sources (Domena and Mosbaugh, 1985; Wittwer and Krokan, 1985). But, as a vertebrate, one should

expect that Atlantic cod possesses both a nuclear and a mitochondrial form of UNG, but so far no effort has been made to reconcile this matter. The UNG from Atlantic cod was similar to other uracil-DNA glycosylases previously purified and characterized with respect to the high pI, and the 2-fold preference to ssDNA than dsDNA (Domena et al., 1988).

4.2. Inhibition by Ugi and uracil
The Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage PBS2 UDGinhibitor (Ugi) inhibits UNG by forming a stable complex with UNG at physiological conditions (Bennett et al., 1993). Ugi binds to hUDG by inserting a b-strand into the conserved DNAbinding groove, and acts by mimicking DNA (Savva and Pearl, 1995). This indicates that the structure of the substrate-binding site of cUNG is similar to other UNGs inhibited by the Ugi.

Enzymes (0.01 U) were incubated at 50, 37, 25 and 4°C, and 5 ml aliquots were transferred to the assay mixture after different time-intervals, and standard assays were performed as described in Section 2. Half-lives were determined to 0.5 (50°C), 20 (37°C) and 60 min (25°C) and 2 h (4°C) for cUNG and 8 (50°C), 30 (37°C) and 150 min (25°C) and 2.6 h (4°C) for rhUNG.

Inhibition with free uracil was in agreement with values previously reported (Domena et al., 1988).

4.3. Optimum conditions
cUNG has a broad pH-optimum from 7.0 to 9.0, and the activity was strongly affected by NaCl concentration. A broad pH-optimum has previously been reported for several other UDGs (Winters and Williams, 1993; Purnapatre and Varshney, 1998). Interestingly, the NaCl-optimum for cUNG increases as pH decreases. It has previously been demonstrated that UDG functions in a processive manner at low ionic strength, which, as NaCl concentration increases the enzyme, switches to a distributive mechanism (Higley and Lloyd, 1993; Bennett et al., 1995). However, Purmal et al. (1994) reported that UDG acted in a distributive mechanism at low ionic strength. The processive mechanism is a common feature among several DNA-interactive proteins (polymerases, repressors, restriction/modification enzymes, DNA repair enzymes), and the interactions are generally electrostatic in nature (Lohman, 1986; von Hippel and Berg, 1989). In a UV-endonuclease from Micrococcus luteus, the processive mechanism has also been shown to be pH-dependent (Hamilton and Lloyd, 1989). Therefore, we suggest that the shift in NaCl-optimum with increasing pH reflects the processive/ distributive nature of cUNG and that the controversy in the previous reports may be due to difference in buffer components and pH, in addition to the differences already discussed. The temperature-optimum (41°C) for cUNG was slightly lower than for the warm-adapted rhUNG (45°C; Slupphaug et al., 1995). The relative activity at temperature ranging from 5 to 45°C was higher for cUNG than rhUNG. At temperatures exceeding 45°C, rhUNG shows a higher relative activity than cUNG, presumably as a consequence of the low temperature stability of cUNG.

rhUNG, which are known features for other coldadapted enzymes (Outzen et al., 1996; Berglund et al., 1998). A psychrophilic UDG from a marine bacterium has previously been isolated, and was compared with an E. coli UDG with respect to temperature stability (Sobek et al., 1996). This prokaryotic UNG had a half-life of 2 and 0.5 min at 40 and 45°C, respectively, compared with 27 and 8 min for the E. coli UDG. cUNG was compared with the rhUNG with respect to both temperature and pH stability. At 50°C, rhUNG had a half-life of 8 min, compared with 0.5 min for cUNG. At lower temperature, the differences in half-life were less, although rhUNG was more stable than cUNG at all temperatures examined. Both enzymes were shown to be labile at low pH, whereas at high pH, rhUNG was more stable than cUNG. In conclusion, the UNG from Atlantic cod analyzed in this study was shown to be similar to other UNG previously purified and characterized with respect to molecular weight, high pI, a broad pH-optimum and a 2-fold preference to ssDNA than dsDNA. However, the cUNG was more temperature- and pH-labile and has a higher relative activity at low temperatures than the warmadapted rhUNG. Considering that UNG is a conserved enzyme among different species, cUNG could be a suitable enzyme for further studies of cold-adaptation at a molecular level.

4.4. Temperature and pH stability
Enzymes characterized from cold-adapted species tend to be more temperature and pH-labile, likely due to their flexible structure in order to maintain enzymatic activity at low temperatures (Outzen et al., 1996). cUNG was found to be more both pH- and temperature labile than the References
