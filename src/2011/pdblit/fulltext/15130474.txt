Background: Reverse transcriptase (RT) converts the single-stranded RNA genome of a retrovirus into a double-stranded DNA copy for integration into the host genome. This process requires ribonuclease H as well as RNA- and DNA-directed DNA polymerase activities. Although the overall organization of HIV-1 RT is known from previously reported crystal structures, no structure of a complex including a metal ion, which is essential for its catalytic activity, has been reported. Results: Here we describe the structures at 1.8 A resolution of a catalytically active fragment of RT from

Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) and at 2.6 A of a complex of this fragment with Mn 2+ coordinated in the polymerase active site. On the basis of similarities with HIV-1 RT and rat DNA polymerase 3, we have modeled template/primer and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate substrates into the MMLV RT structure. Conclusions: Our model, in the context of the disposition of evolutionarily conserved residues seen here at high resolution, provides new insights into the mechanisms of catalysis, fidelity, processivity and discrimination between deoxyribose and ribose nucleotides.

Introduction
Reverse transcriptases (RTs) are encoded by all retroviruses and play a defining role in the retroviral life cycle [1,2]. These enzymes couple DNA-directed and RNAdirected polymerase activities with a ribonuclease (RNase) H activity to make a double-stranded DNA copy of the single-stranded RNA genome of the retrovirus [3,4], which is then integrated into the host genome by the retroviral integrase. Genetic and biochemical characterizations have been made for various RTs, particularly for Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and HIV-1. In spite of their relative simplicity, lacking the associated components of conventional replicative polymerases, the RT enzymes are very effective. They are highly processive, making many primer extensions without dissociation of the template. They copy the template with rather good intrinsic fidelity (error rates of 1 in 104-106) [5], but in the absence of editing machinery this leads to a mutability that is exploited to escape immune defenses. They also incorporate deoxyribonucleotides to the exclusion of their ribose counterparts. While these properties have been characterized, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood. On the basis of analogies with other systems, a two-metal mechanism for catalysis has been proposed, but structural details have not been described for RT [6-8]. Because of its critical role in infection, the RT of HIV-1 has become one of the

targets of drug therapy efforts against AIDS. In fact, the drugs currently available for treatment of patients with AIDS include 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT), 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (4dT), which all act by inhibiting HIV-1 RT [9]. These drugs, however, have not been satisfactory in preventing the progression of AIDS. Drug-resistant strains of HIV-1 emerge that are found to have mutations in RT [9]. Murine, avian, and human retroviruses produce RTs that differ in size and subunit structure [3]. Murine retroviral RT is a monomer as isolated from MMLV with a molecular weight of 75 kDa [10]. It has been suggested that this enzyme may be homodimeric in the presence of substrate [11]. Avian and human retroviral enzymes are both heterodimers. The human retroviral RT from HIV consists of 66 kDa (p66) and 51 kDa (p51) subunits. The smaller subunit results from retroviral proteolytic removal of the RNase H domain from the p66 subunit. Both subunits contain four domains denoted fingers, palm, thumb and connection. The naming of the first three domains refers to their resemblance to a right-hand as first described in the structure of the Klenow fragment from Escherichia coli DNA polymerase [12]. Avian retroviral RT from RSV comprises a 95 kDa and a 63 kDa subunit, the latter being a processed version of the former. It retains an integrase domain as part of the RT on the

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 9 larger subunit [13,14]. In spite of architectural differences, retroviral RTs are homologous proteins with highly conserved motifs [15-18] and overall sequence identities at the level of 25%. The structure of HIV-1 RT has now been reported in five distinctly different crystal lattices. The first was reported by Kohlstaedt et al. [19] in a complex with the non-nucleoside inhibitor (NNI) nevirapine at 3.5 A (later refined at 2.9 A resolution [20]). This revealed an asymmetrical arrangement of the p66 and p51 subunits. Although corresponding domains in p66 and p51 are similar in structure, the tertiary structure of p51 is significantly different from that of p66. In this same crystal lattice, two additional NNI complexes, a 2.8 A resolution complex with ot-anilinophenylacetamide (ot-APA) [21] and a 3.0 A resolution complex with tetrahydroimidazo(4,5,1-1-jk)(1,4)-benzodiazepin-2(1 H)-one (TIBO) [22] have been reported. The second distinct crystal lattice reported was a complex with Fab and a 19/18mer oligonucleotide at 3.0 A resolution [23]. A third distinct lattice co-crystallized with nevirapine was described at 4.2 A [24]. More recently, a fourth lattice was reported for an unliganded state at 3.2 A resolution [25]. The fifth distinct lattice has been reported for four structures of complexes with NNIs [26] described at 2.2-3.0 A and a 2.35 A unliganded state [27]. In addition, Unge et al. [28] have reported the 2.2 A resolution structure of the N-terminal fragment of HIV-1 RT (residues 1-216). The 1-216 fragment includes the fingers domain and a truncated palm domain lacking three 13strands [28]. We have focused structural investigations on MMLV RT in the hope that insights gained from comparing conserved features among different RTs will help in elucidating fundamental mechanisms, and that ultimately, this may lead to the design of more effective drugs for the treatment of AIDS. In order to enhance our understanding of the enzymatic mechanism of RTs, we have concentrated on obtaining results at high resolution. Here we report the structure at 1.8 A of a polymerase catalytic fragment (produced by limited proteolysis with trypsin), which includes the fingers and palm domains of MMLV RT (residues 10-278 of the 671 present in the whole molecule). This fragment is catalytically active in standard RT assays [11], although its activity is substantially reduced (-6000-fold) relative to the whole molecule (M Georgiadis, unpublished data). The fragment also binds oligonucleotides, again more weakly than the whole enzyme. In gel shift assays, the fragment displays a preference for double-stranded oligonucleotides with a single-strand overhang as opposed to blunt-ended oligonucleotides (M Georgiadis, unpublished data). We conclude that the essential catalytic machinery is intact as the observed activity is qualitatively explained by defects in binding and processivity. The crystal structure of this catalytic fragment is at sufficiently high resolution to provide reliably defined details of polypeptide conformations and solvent interactions in the active site. In addition, we have determined the structure of a complex with a metal ion at 2.6 A resolution, which locates the metal ion in the catalytic site as required for polymerase activity. Comparison of this structure from MMLV RT with the corresponding portions of HIV-1 RT structures shows that significant differences exist but that many features are conserved. To help in understanding the roles of conserved residues, we have constructed a conservative model of the ternary complex with oligonucleotide and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) substrates on the basis of superpositions with the HIV-1 RT/DNA complex structure [23] and the rat DNA polymerase P3 ternary complex structure [8]. The structural comparisons, together with this model of the ternary complex, generate specific hypotheses about the roles of conserved residues and certain mechanistic aspects of processivity, fidelity, and the incorporation of dNTPs in preference to ribonucleotides (NTPs). Many of these findings are of general significance for other enzymes that have polymerase activities.

Results and discussion Structure description The structural model was interpreted from a combined multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) and single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) phased electron-density map at 2.5 A resolution and refined at 1.8 A to an R-value of 0.197 for all data as detailed in the Materials and methods section. The experimental electron-density map and the corresponding 1.8 A 2F -F c map are shown for the polymerase active site region of the molecule in Figure 1. The structure consists of two domains, fingers and palm, both of which exhibit a+3 folds as seen in Figure 2. The nomenclature for secondary structural elements is as follows: a helices have letters assigned alphabetically from the N terminus of the molecule to the C terminus and strands have been numbered sequentially from the N to the C terminus. Corresponding secondary structural elements in the HIV-1 RT model [27] and our model do not have the same letter or number because our structure includes additional elements not found in the HIV-1 RT model. The fingers domain contains a highly twisted fivestranded mixed sheet comprising strands 32, 33, 134, 8 and 139. This sheet is partly defined on topological grounds because only one main-chain hydrogen bond exists between strands 134 and g38 the middle of the in sheet instead of the usual two or more main-chain hydrogen bonds. Additional secondary structural elements in the fingers include three aohelices: ac (which is bent in our structure due to the presence of Pro76 in the middle of the helix), aD and aG (which is a 310 helix). Helix aol in the HIV-1 RT structures, which is equivalent to our atc, does not contain a proline and is not bent. There are also two hairpin structures, 38-139, which is part of the sheet, and 134-135. The main-chain hydrogen-bonding pattern for the 34-35 hairpin is broken before the poorly ordered [34-135 loop.

(Produced with PLUTO implemented in the CCP4 software package 150].) The palm domain contains a four-stranded antiparallel P sheet (P7, 31O, 311 and [12) and two long a helices (aH and al) which define the core of this domain. Additionally, it contains a [3 hairpin including strands P13 and P14 at the C terminus of the molecule, denoted the primer-grip [23], two short N-terminal a helices (aA and aB), a short 3 10 helix (F) leading into the fingers domain, and one additional short a helix (aE). The regular a-helical hydrogen-bonding pattern is broken in aH. For two pairs of main-chain hydrogen bonds (i.e. between residues 205-209 and 206-210) a water molecule intervenes between the carbonyl oxygen and amide nitrogen atoms of each pair to create a bend in H. Figure 3 details the residues comprising the secondary structure in a structural alignment of the fingers and palm domains of HIV-1 RT and MMLV RT. The two domains of the catalytic fragment are structurally integrated such that the boundaries between them blur. The chain originates and ends in the palm domain (lower portion in Fig. 2) and makes two passages into and back from the fingers domain (upper portion in Fig. 2), aB-3 1, aD-P, 6 aF-°G and P9-aH. The interface between the fingers and palm domains, which includes the connecting segments, contains conserved elements that are crucial for function and others needed to maintain the fold as discussed below. The approximate domain boundaries for fingers and palm domains are as follows: fingers 41-124 and 159-194, palm 24-40, 125-158 and 195-274. Several conserved residues (see Fig. 3) are involved in main-chain hydrogen-bonding interactions which probably stabilize the structure. These residues include Lys53, Gln63, Ser195 and Gln260. The N atom of Lys53 forms a hydrogen bond to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Lysl20 of atD. The side-chain hydroxyl of Ser195 is hydrogen bonded to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen

Secondary structural elements for MMLV RT and the 2.35 A unliganded HIV-1 RT [27] structures found in the palm are shaded gray; those in the fingers are boxed and unshaded. Underlined for HIV-1 RT are the sequence and corresponding secondary structural elements assigned in [23]. Residues conserved in the avian, human and murine RTs, based on our sequence alignments, are in bold text. Vertical lines indicate identical residues, two dots indicate very similar residues, and one dot indicates somewhat similar residues in MMLV and HIV-1 sequences. The larger gray boxes encompassing both sequences are the residues used in the superposition analysis. of Pro189, which is part of a highly conserved loop in the interface between the fingers and palm domains. Gln63 NE and OE atoms form two hydrogen bonds with the main-chain atoms of Lys98 thereby hydrogen sheet of the fingers domain. bonding 32 to 134 in the 13 A similar hydrogen-bonding arrangement exists for Gln260 and Lys267, between which residues there are two hydrogen bonds connecting 1312 and P131, which are part of the primer-grip. All of these interactions appear to have structural roles in our model and these are presumably important because these residues are conserved in the RT family. Comparison with the RNP motif The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) motif is an RNA-binding domain found in a number of proteins that mediate processing of RNAs (for review, see [29]). RNP motifs, comprising 90-100 amino acids, are the only RNAbinding domains for which detailed structural information is available. The crystal structure of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) A revealed that it has a motif that makes up a four-stranded antiparallel 13oat13 13 sheet with two flanking helices [30]. The sheet is antiparallel but each 13ot13 unit has a classic right-handed conformation. This has also been shown to be the structure for a human heterogeneous nuclear RNP [31], and the same topology is found in several other proteins, as noted by Cheah et al. [32]. We noticed, as did Unge et al. [28], that the topology of the palm domain is identical to the topology of the RNP motif and have now compared the structures by CaL superposition. As shown in Figure 4, the structures of the palm domain and the RNP motif are not identical but are strikingly similar. We suggest that the fingers domain could be considered to result from a series of insertions in the palm domain and that the palm domain may in fact be evolutionarily related to the RNP motif. RNPs contain two highly conserved binding motifs, RNP1 and RNP2, that correspond to the secondary structural elements 131 and 133 of the RNP motif. Corresponding strands from MMLV RT would be 137 and 311 (34 and 18 in HIV-1 RT; see Fig. 3) in the palm domain. Very little sequence similarity exists between 17 and RNP1 and even less between 131 and RNP2 that has been modified to include a polymerase active site. The fold shared by the palm domain of RTs and RNAbinding proteins may provide a general nucleic acid binding domain that has been utilized by a number of different proteins including DNA polymerase from E. coli [12] and T7 RNA polymerase [33]. Both of these polymerases have palm domains similar to that found in RT, but the fingers domains are more variable. Moreover, the recent structure of an RNA complex with U1 snRNP [34] shows that RNA binding occurs on the same surface of the RNP as that used for nucleic acid binding by the

Superimposed Ca traces are shown in stereo with the U1 snRNP domain in blue, the MMLV RT core fragment in green and the Klenow fragment fingers and palm domains in magenta. (Superpositions and stereo drawings were generated using INSIGHT [391.) polymerases. Rat DNA polymerase 3, however, does not have a Po3PP3ot folding motif [35]. Comparison with HIV-1 RT We have compared our structure of fingers and palm domains to those found in five models for HIV-1 RT [20,23,25,27,28]. The overall fold and structures of these two domains in our protein are very similar to that described in the HIV-1 RT structures with a few exceptions. The MMLV RT sequence includes an additional N-terminal 40 amino acids not present in the HIV-1 RT sequence, as predicted using GCG [36] sequence alignments. Our structural model includes 16 ordered residues not present in the HIV-1 RT structure. The consequence of these additional residues is that, in contrast to the HIV-1 RT, which has its N terminus in the fingers domain, the MMLV RT fold starts in the palm domain. The overall sequence identity for the two RTs is 24.8%. If just the fingers and palm domains are compared, the sequence identity is 28.7%. We conclude, therefore, that these two domains are not appreciably more related than the other domains in the protein. We have aligned the sequences of MMLV RT and HIV-1 RT, as shown in Figure 3, based on superposition analysis restricting insertions and deletions between elements of secondary structure. The sequence identity based on our alignment is 26.0%. We have also compared the secondary structure in the two molecules using the 2.35 A unliganded HIV-1 RT [27] for comparison. The assignment of secondary structure for both models has been performed using Kabsch and Sander's algorithm [37]. Many of the secondary structural elements are present in both structures. Our structure includes three additional a helices and three strands not present in the HIV-1 RT structure (A, tB, aE, 31, P 6 and 1312) . We have also identified helices F and aG as 310 helices, which correspond to a3 and a4 in the HIV-1 RT model. The structural alignment (see Fig. 3) of these sequences summarizes the similar and dissimilar structural elements for the fingers and palm domains of these two RTs and provides a more accurate correspondence of the linear sequences than can be obtained by sequence information alone. We have further characterized the differences between the HIV-1 and MMLV RTs by superimposing Co positions from the fingers and palm domains of the p66 subunit of HIV-1 RT on the MMLV RT fingers and palm domains. The individual palm (see Fig. 5) and fingers domains superimpose with root mean square deviations (rmsds) of 0.6-1.4 A for the various models, as shown in Table 1. However, superposition of both domains simultaneously results in much larger rmsds, indicating shifts of one domain relative to the other in the various models, as discussed below. Superpositions were performed using TOSS [38] and INSIGHT [39]. We also note that in a superposition including the full HIV-1 RT molecule, the region of our structure between 36 and aE is brought into very close contact with residues 136-142 from p51. This implies that dimerization of MMLV RT would require an altered interface or a conformational change in order to accommodate the dimer interface observed in the HIV-1 RT structures. In order to describe the orientation of the fingers domains with respect to the palm domains, we have used Cot coordinates for palm domains previously superimposed and then superimposed the fingers domains in TOSS [38] to give a relative angle and translation between two fingers domains. The results (Table 1) indicate that small differences exist in the relative angles and translations in all of the structures compared. Relative angles and translations are given for p66 versus p51 for comparison. These relative shifts have very small effects on the interface between the two domains with the exception of the truncated (1-216) HIV-1 RT model [28], which has a substantial shift of the fingers domain into the interface. Missing strands in the palm domain of the 1-216 model may account for this altered interface. The additional N-terminal 16 residues found in MMLV RT change the size of the interface between the fingers and palm domains, which is the most notable difference in the comparison with HIV-1 RT (see Fig. 5). The fact that the fingers and palm domains in MMLV RT are resistant to proteolytic degradation is consistent with the notion that these two domains form a relatively rigid unit within the molecule. It has been noted by others

*Models are as follows: mmlv, MMLV RT core fragment model; dnafab, HIV-1 RT Ca coordinates [23] (PDB entry 1HMI); nev, HIV-1 RT model with nevirapine [20] (PDB entry 3HVT); apo_3.2, HIV-1 RT unliganded model [25] (PDB entry 1HMV); apo_2.35, HIV-1 RT unliganded Ca coordinates [27] (obtained from D Stuart), and 216, HIV-1 RT truncated Ca coordinates [28] (obtained from B Strandberg). The p66 and p51 coordinates are taken from the apo_2.35 model. tThe relative rotations and translations for superpositions of the fingers domains are defined by starting with Ca coordinates already transformed by superpositions of palm domain residues. We note that the relative angle of rotation is sensitive to the relative translation.

[21,24,25], that when different structural models of HIV-1 RT are superimposed, the fingers and palm domains of the p66 subunit behave approximately as a rigid unit when compared with the other domains in the enzyme. This is consistent with our finding in comparing the catalytic fragment of MMLV RT with HIV-1 RT. Polymerase active site and metal binding The polymerase active site is located at the junction of the fingers and palm domains and includes three highly conserved aspartate residues (150, 224 and 225) that are required for polymerase activity [40-42]. Each of the

aspartate carboxylate oxygen atoms forms a hydrogen bond to a water molecule, which in turn is hydrogen bonded directly to another water molecule, to a mainchain amide nitrogen atom, or to a carbonyl oxygen atom, resulting in an extensive network of water molecules (see Fig. 6a). Both Asp224 and Asp225 have one carboxylate oxygen atom within hydrogen-bonding distance of the same water molecule. However, a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate oxygen from Asp224 is not directionally favorable. The remaining carboxylate oxygen atoms from Asp224 and Asp225 are linked in a hydrogenbonding network through two water molecules.

Water molecules are shown as enlarged spheres and hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines. (Drawn with PLUTO [50].) (b) A stereoview similar to that in (a) is shown for a metal-binding experiment. A difference Fourier map (shown in blue) resulting from data 2+ collected with Mn bound in the crystal is shown superimposed on the refined native (green) and metal-complexed (red) models. The contour level shown for the map is 4a. We had originally hypothesized that metal ions, either magnesium or manganese [10], which are required for polymerase activity, would replace water molecules in the active site. We report here the first complex for an RT containing a metal ion. We find one Mn 2+ bound in the polymerase active site coordinated to Asp224 and Asp225 and replacing a water molecule (see Fig. 6b). The experimental difference density for the metal site is significantly elongated, indicating anisotropic disorder of the metal site (see the Materials and methods section). This disorder is probably due to the incomplete coordination sphere observed for the metal site, which has two carboxylate oxygen ligands from Asp225 and one from Asp224. The nearest oxygen ligand from Asp150 is 3.5 A away (if the metal ion is placed in the center of the difference electron density) and is not a likely ligand. We have not determined water coordination to this metal ion conclusively, but find evidence for no more than two potential coordinating water molecules (see the Materials and methods section). As shown in Figure 6b, the protein structure in the polymerase active site is perturbed very little by the binding of one metal ion, with only slight changes in the positions of Asp224, Asp225 and Asp150. However, the water structure in the active site has been perturbed relative to the native structure. Presumably, the coordination sphere of the metal ion is completed by the binding of substrate. These results support the existence of a preformed metal-binding site involving Asp224 and Asp225. Consistent with a previous report describing metal ion binding in rat polymerase 3 [43], a single metal site is found in the active site of MMLV RT in the absence of bound nucleotide. Mn2 + in this site would be responsible for assisting deprotonation of the ribose 3'-hydroxyl in order to facilitate nucleophilic attack on the a phosphate of the dNTP according to the proposed mechanisms of polymerization [6,8]. We do, however, expect differences in detail for the disposition of active-site groups between the rat polymerase 3 and MMLV RT structures. These two enzymes, although they are both polymerases, have substantially different structures and functional activities. The 1o-11 turn in our structure is a type II' turn with Val223 (=56.3°,*=-103.2 ° ) at position 2 of the turn (see Fig. 1). The position 2 residue of type II' turns is more commonly a glycine which, lacking a C3 atom, avoids close van der Waals contacts with other atoms in the turn. However, the RT sequences all exhibit a nonglycine residue in this position. An important consequence of this particular turn is a hydrogen-bonding interaction between one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp224 and its main-chain amide nitrogen atom, which specifies carboxylate orientation and stabilizes the tight turn (Fig. 6a). Binding of Mn 2+ in the active site does not disrupt this hydrogen bond. Type II' turns have also been described for the equivalent (YXDD) 7-138 turn of HIV-1 RT in recently reported structures of

886

Structure 1995, Vol 3 No 9 unliganded RT at 3.2 A [25] and in both an NNI-RT complex at 2.2 A [26] and uninhibited RT at 2.35 A [27]. This turn appears to be very sensitive to changes that occur elsewhere in the enzyme; it is in a standard conformation in the prematurely truncated 1-216 fragment of HIV-1 RT [28], and conformations differ between the uninhibited and inhibited states of intact HIV-1 RT [21,27] with the carboxylate group ofAspl85 (224 in MMLV RT) projecting out and away in the inhibited state [26]. Although the hydrogen-bonding interaction seen here for MMLV RT is not reported for the active state of HIV-1 RT, published data [27] appear to be compatible with this conformation. We suggest that the conformation for this turn and the hydrogenbonded specification of the orientation of Asp224 (Aspl85 in HIV-1 RT) may be crucial for the mechanism of polymerization. Additional stabilization of the type II' turn in our structure is provided by Asp200 which forms a hydrogen bond to the main-chain amide nitrogen of Val223. Interaction with template/primer and dNTP We have modeled the binding of template/primer A-form DNA and dNTP to the MMLV RT fragment using previously reported experimental results [8,23]. This modeling was motivated by the similarity described above between the fingers and palm domains of MMLV and HIV-1 RT structures and the prospect that functional roles might be deduced for conserved residues, as accurately defined by this high-resolution structure of MMLV RT. A-form DNA was selected on the basis of the experimental results of Jacobo-Molina et al. [23] who reported the structure of A-form DNA bound in the polymerase active site of HIV-1 RT. In addition, we would logically expect an enzyme that can utilize either a DNA template/DNA primer, which adopts many helical forms, or an RNA template/DNA primer, which would most probably have A-form helical parameters, to have an active site that would accommodate an A-form duplex. Despite the simplicity of our modeling, which involved direct superposition without further modifications (as detailed in the Materials and methods section), we find surprisingly few close contacts. As modeled, close contacts do exist between the phosphate coordinates in the model dATP and Asp224 and Asp225. Adjustments would be needed, but in general the model is consistent with a two-metal mechanism with 3'-hydroxyl activation as discussed above. On the basis of our ternary model complex (see Fig. 7a) and an analysis of conserved residues found in avian, murine and human RTs (Fig. 3), we propose structural features that are likely to contribute to additional properties of RTs, such as fidelity of template-directed polymerization and processivity in replication (defined as the number of nucleotides incorporated per cycle of binding, synthesis and dissociation). We also suggest a structural basis for selectivity by RTs of dNTPs over NTPs in the active site. RTs incorporate dNTPs exclusively. Fidelity of template-directed polymerization We have identified conserved residues that are likely to be involved in minor groove hydrogen bonding of the dNTP and the template base-paired to it, and which may contribute to correct alignment for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. We propose that the highly conserved residues Glnl90 (151 in HIV-1 RT) and Glyl91 (152 in HIV-1 RT) found in the conserved sequence LPQG within loop 9 -aH (part of motif B, a conserved sequence found in RTs [15-18]), form hydrogen bonds in the minor groove to 02 or N3 of the dNTP and template base, respectively. In our ternary model, NE of Gln190 is in an appropriate position to form a hydrogen bond to N3 of dATP. The main-chain amide nitrogen of Glyl91 is in approximately the correct position to form a hydrogen bond to 02, as shown in Fig. 7b. Upon ternary complex formation, only very small changes in the exact positioning of the incoming nucleotide and loop P9--OH (6--5 in HIV-1 RT) relative to our model would be sufficient to form the Gly191 amide nitrogen to base 02 or N3 hydrogen bond as proposed. Previously, it was proposed that this loop interacted only with the template strand [23]. We note that Asn279 in the rat polymerase 13 ternary complex structure [8], which is 2.96 A from the 02 atom of ddCTP and has been proposed to hydrogen bond to the incoming nucleotide, is in a similar position to Gln190 in our model. Thus, this hydrogen-bonding potential has been conserved in other polymerases. Although Gly191 is not conserved in the rat polymerase 13 structure, Arg283 guanidino N1ll atom is 3.25 A from the template base N3 and could potentially form a hydrogen bond. Because this part of the interface between the fingers and palm domains in RT consists of a loop, Gly191 has probably been conserved in this position because of its ability to angles and therefore make the hydrogen adopt any (,) bond with the template base. Asn279 and Arg283 are part of an ot helix in rat polymerase 13. Other residues involved in binding the dNTP and the primer strand in the active site include the conserved aspartate residues 150, 224 and 225, in addition to Lys258, which we propose binds to the terminal phosphate in a similar way to Arg149 found in the rat polymerase 13 ternary complex structure. The proposed minor groove hydrogen-bonding interactions with N3 or 02 of the template and dNTP provide a way to position the dNTP and template strand in the active site without requiring base specificity. As was previously shown [44], N3 and 02 are equivalent positions in the minor groove for purine and pyrimidine bases and provide no distinction between different bases. This type of interaction is ideal for a polymerase that must have a way to position all four dNTPs appropriately in order to catalyze the reaction. The issue of fidelity concerns not only the ability to position substrates correctly for the chemical reaction, but also the ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect nucleotides. It seems quite implausible that Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding and base-stacking interactions alone

Fig. 7. Interaction between MMLV RT, Aform DNA and dNTP in the polymerase active site. (a) The template strand, primer strand and dNTP are shown in a stick representation in green, red and orange, respectively. The MMLV RT core fragment is represented as a ribbon schematic with conserved residues (i.e. those present in avian, human and murine RTs) shown in ball-and-stick representation. The catalytic aspartate residues 150, 224 and 225 are shown in yellow. Conserved residues that probably interact with dNTP and the template base to which it is hydrogen bonded (colored magenta) include Gln190, Gly191 and Lys258. Blue residues are those which are within 4-5 A of the template/primer model and which may be involved in direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonding. (b) A ball-and-stick representation of the minor groove hydrogen-bonding interactions and ribonucleotide discrimination is shown for our ternary complex model including residues 189-191, 153-156, the incoming nucleotide, dATP, and the template base dT to which it is base paired. Pro189 is shown in red, Gin190 in yellow, Gly191 in blue, residues 153-156 in magenta, dATP in orange, and dT in green. A ribose 2'hydroxyl group (blue) has been modeled on the dATP from our ternary complex model. Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed lines between the NE atom of Gln190 and N3 from dATP, N from Glyl90.and 02 from the template dT base paired to dATP, in addition to the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds.

would be sufficient for positioning the substrate correctly for the polymerization reaction. The additional hydrogen-bonding interactions in the minor groove are expected to be more favorable for the incorporation of the correct nucleotide given that the initial binding should involve Watson-Crick hydrogen-bonding interactions. Base pairing would then be followed by small conformational changes in the 9xH loop and the nucleic acid allowing the additional hydrogen bonds to form and position the nucleotide and template correctly for catalysis. We expect that minor groove hydrogen-bonding interactions may be used by a number of DNA polymerases whose abilities to discriminate between correct and incorrect substrates may be improved by the nature of the interfaces between the fingers and palm domains. Conserved residues that are close enough to interact with the sugar-phosphate backbone of our model DNA include LyslO3, ArgilO, Aspll4, Argll6, Asnll9, Tyr222, Gly270 and Tyr271 as shown in Fig. 7a. Tyr222 is located in the polymerase active site and appears to be within hydrogen-bonding distance of the N3 or 02 position of

the template base in the duplex portion of the substrate, which is three bases from the 3'-hydroxyl polymerization start site. Gly270 and Tyr271 are located in the primergrip region and also interact with the primer strand of the substrate. Residues that interact with the template strand include LyslO3, Arg1lO and Aspll4. Argll6 and Asnl9 appear to interact with the primer strand. These interactions are probably hydrogen bonds involving direct interaction, water-mediated hydrogen bonding, or electrostatic interactions in the case of charged residues. Processivity Conserved aspects of the electrostatic potential surface of the catalytic fragment suggest that electrostatics may play a role in processivity. Electrostatic potential surfaces of fingers and palm domains from MMLV RT and HIV-1 RT [20] are shown in Figure 8. The electrostatic potential is mapped on the solvent-accessible surface calculated with a 1.4 A probe radius. Full charges for sides chains and partial charges for main-chain atoms were used assuming a pH of 8. (A comparison with the electrostatic potential surface of the intact HIV-1 RT reveals no differences for the isolated

Fig. 8. Electrostatic potential surfaces of the fingers and palm domains of (a) MMLV RT and (b) HIV-1 RT [20] with modeled DNA template/primer. The surface potentials were calculated using DELPHI [61] and displayed using the program GRASP [62]. Purple regions represent positive, red negative, and white neutral potential. The modeled template/primer is represented as a phosphate backbone ribbon with the template strand in purple and the primer strand in red. The large red area near the 3'-end of the primer strand is the polymerase active site. fingers and palm domains.) We note that the overall shapes of these two domains of the RTs differ from one another. Conserved features of these surfaces include a highly basic patch near the primer strand within the fingers domain in addition to the negatively charged catalytic site. The positively charged region is not close enough to hydrogen bond directly to the DNA in our model. We propose that this region may be involved in electrostatic charge interactions holding the substrate on the enzyme after a dissociative impulse following the nucleotidyl transfer reaction, such that the newly incorporated nucleotide 'ratchets' into the 3' position. A similar metaphor has been invoked by others [45]. The ratcheting mechanism would involve repositioning of the template/primer without requiring product release. We envisage a positively charged 'hook' on the surface of the fingers domain holding the nucleic acid on the enzyme by the primer strand while allowing for repositioning in the active site, thereby promoting processivity of polymerization in RT. This interaction would be only one of several interactions with other domains of the RT that would be likely to promote processivity. Selectivity for dNTPs RTs, like other DNA polymerases, selectively incorporate dNTPs as opposed to NTPs. Our model suggests that the structural basis of that selectivity may be an unfavorable interaction between Phe155 and the 2'-hydroxyl of a ribose nucleotide. The sugar ring of the nucleotide is approximately stacked over Phe155 as shown in Figure 7b. The distance between the C2' atom and Phe155 is 4.5 A in our model, which would bring the 2'-hydroxyl within 3 A of the aromatic ring. However, we suggest that small conformational changes would produce unfavorably close interactions and thus discriminate between ribose and deoxyribose sugars in nucleotides. Although Phe155 is not absolutely conserved, the only other residue found in this position in other RTs is tyrosine, which would serve this purpose equally well. Biological implications Reverse transcriptase (RT) plays a crucial role in the replication of a retrovirus. DNA- and RNAdirected DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H activities associated with RT are responsible for the creation of a double-stranded DNA copy of a single-stranded retroviral RNA genome. This doublestranded DNA copy is then integrated into the host genome by the retroviral integrase. Several crystal structures of the HIV-1 RT have been reported. We report the first structure of a catalytic fragment of the related Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) RT at 1.8 A resolution. In addition, we report the first complex of RT containing a metal ion. One Mn2 + is coordinated in the polymerase active site to an apparently preformed metal ion binding site. Structural comparison of functionally similar RTs and modeling studies with template/primer and deoxyribonucleotide substrates in MMLV RT, on the basis of similarities with rat DNA polymerase P and HIV-1 RT, have provided us with new insights into some aspects of the polymerization reaction accomplished by RT. These include the catalytic nucleotidyl transfer reaction, fidelity of nucleotide incorporation, processivity, and discrimination between deoxyribonucleotide and ribonucleotide substrates. In addition, we now have a structural (and therefore, more accurate) alignment of the sequences of MMLV and HIV-1 RT. Several of the drug-resistant mutations in HIV-1 RT are found in MMLV RT as the native sequence; for example, Leu74-Val [46] and Metl84-Val [47] which confer resistance of HIV-1 RT to dideoxyinosine and dideoxycytidine, respectively. Thus, the structure of MMLV RT may provide a model for understanding mutations in HIV-1 RT associated with nucleoside analog resistance found in clinical isolates. In addition, drug design could be facilitated by targeting conserved regions of the protein and testing for a drug's ability to inhibit MMLV RT as well as HIV-1 RT.

Materials and methods Preparation of proteolytic fragment We originally attempted to crystallize the whole MMLV RT enzyme as well as a truncated form lacking the RNase H

MMLV reverse transcriptase Georgiadis et al. domain. MMLV RT enzymes were expressed in E. coli from vectors constructed by Telesnitsky and co-workers [11,49] and purified by a modification (M Georgiadis, unpublished data) of previously described protocols [48]. Small crystals were obtained for both of these enzymes. Despite efforts to improve the crystals by seeding and complexation with oligonucleotides, tRNA, metals and nucleotides, the best crystals diffracted to 6 A. We therefore explored limited proteolysis in order to define domain boundaries in the protein, which would allow us to obtain a molecule that might.prove more suitable for X-ray diffraction studies. A number of proteolytic enzymes cleaved MMLV RT leaving a stable 30 kDa fragment (M Georgiadis, unpublished data). The proteolytic fragment that we characterized resulted from trypsin cleavage of a truncated form of the enzyme including amino acids 1-497, which lacks the RNase H domain [11]. N-terminal sequencing identified the N terminus of our fragment as residue 10. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the C terminus is a mixture terminating at either residue 274 or 278. This fragment includes fingers and palm domains of the RT. The details of the proteolysis, purification and crystallizations will be described elsewhere. Structure determination Crystals of the polymerase catalytic fragment of MMLV RT were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 20°C. Drops contained equal volumes of reservoir solution and approximately 40 mg ml-1 protein in 50 mM 2-[N-morpholino]ethanesulphonic acid pH 6.0, 0.25 M NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The reservoir solutions contained 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.2 M NH 4 C1 and 20% polyethylene glycol 4000. Microseeding was required in order to grow single crystals of suitable size for the structure determination. The crystals proved to belong to space group P32 21 and have cell constants a=b=84.08 A, c=73.97 A, ot==90° , y=120 ° with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Soaking crystals in 2.5 mM mercuric acetate produced a three-site derivative solved by Patterson methods from data recorded on two Hamlin-Xuong area detectors. Area detector data were integrated using the UCSD software package [49] and scaled using CCP4 [50]. MAD and SIRAS phasing methods were used to solve the structure. The MAD experiment was conducted at the NSLS, HHMI X4A beamline, on mercuric acetate derivatized crystals. Focusing of a 2 mrad swathe of radiation was accomplished by sagittal focusing through a double Si 111 crystal monochromator. A vertical slit placed before the monochromator was set at about 1 mm to define the energy resolution. A 0.3 mm collimator was used. The NSLS source was operated at 2.5 GeV with currents starting at approximately 240 mA. Three wavelengths were selected to maximize dispersive and Bijvoet signals based on the X-ray absorption spectrum for the derivatized crystal near the Lin mercury edge, X1=1.0093 A (edge), k2 =1.0062 A (peak) and X3=0.99188 A (remote). Five crystals were used to collect data to Bragg spacings of 2.3 A. Inverse beam geometry was used to collect Bijvoet mates on sequential images at each wavelength. Data were recorded on Fuji HRIII phosphor imaging plates by oscillation photography and scanned on a Fuji BAS 2000 scanner. Data were integrated using DENZO [51] and then reduced using CCP4 programs ROTAVATA and AGROVATA [50] for SIRAS phasing or modified versions for MADSYS phasing. MADSYS programs developed by Hendrickson were used to calculate phases as previously described [52]. Data processing and phasing statistics are presented in Tables 2 and 3.

Phasing derived from the area detector data to 3.5 A, MAD phasing to 3.0 A and SIRAS phasing to 2.5 A were combined by summing ABCD coefficients with figure of merit weighting [53]. SIRAS phasing derived from area detector data was used primarily to complement missing

Electrondensity maps calculated from three different phase sets, combined MAD and SIRAS, MAD, and SIRAS, were used for interpretation. Features of these maps include carbonyl oxygen density and unambiguous side-chain density for the majority of the amino acid residues. The best electron-density map was that calculated with the combined MAD and SIRAS phases (see Fig. 1). An initial model was built using FRODO [54]. As a point of interest, it should be noted that selenomethionyl (Se-Met)-substituted protein was prepared in a methionyl auxotrophic strain of E. coli as previously described [55]. Crystals were grown under very similar conditions to the native protein and found to diffract similarly. However, analysis of MAD data collected at NSLS from these crystals indicated that the Se-Met residues were all poorly ordered. We were not able to identify locations for the Se atoms in either isomorphous difference or anomalous difference Patterson maps using the MAD data but were able to locate the Se atoms in difference Fouriers calculated at 5 A using the mercury derivative phasing. The Se-Met data did not result in useful phasing information and were therefore not included in the final phasing of the structure. Initial refinement of the model was performed using X-PLOR conjugate-gradient minimization [56] using 5.0-2.5 A data (F>2u) and then extended to 1.8 A resolution. The starting model had an R-value of 0.41. The refinement converged with an R-value of 0.25 for the starting model. Following five cycles of rebuilding with FRODO [54] and refinement in X-PLOR, an R-value of 0.22 was obtained for the protein model and 57 water molecules. The refinement has been completed with PROLSQ [57] as implemented in CCP4 [50]. The model currently includes residues 24-274 and 125 water molecules. Criteria for water selection were limited to peaks with electron-density values of 0.4 e- A- 3 found in both Fo-F c maps and 2Fo-Fc maps and that were within 3.4 A of an oxygen or nitrogen atom in the model. In addition, a B-factor limit of <60 A2 was used to select water molecules. The R-value, including 10-1.8 A data with F>3cr, is 0.185, with rms bond deviations of 0.014 A and rms angle distance deviations of 0.032 A (see Table 2). Evaluation of our model with PROCHECK [50] reveals that 92% of the residues in our model have (q,) values that fall within the most favorable regions of a Ramachandran plot. The only non-glycine outlier is Val223 (=56.3°,t=-103.2°), which is located in the type II' turn in the polymerase active site. We have confirmed this conformation for Val223, seen in our experimental electrondensity map (see Fig. 1), using simulated annealing omit map procedures implemented in X-PLOR [56] including data from 10-1.8 A. Atomic positions for side-chain atoms have been reliably assigned for residues 24-274 excluding a loop ( 4-3 5), which includes residues 102-108 for which we have marginal main-chain density. Side-chain atom positions for residues 102-108 were modeled using steric constraints enforced by the loop and are not reliable. No electron density was observed for residues 10-23 in this structure. Coordinates for the native structure have been deposited with the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry code 1MML). Metal ion complex A complex with Mn 2+ was prepared by soaking a crystal (0.15x0.15x0O.3 mm 3 ) for 3 h in a synthetic mother liquor containing 20 mM MnC12. Data were collected to 2.6 A resolution on an R-axis II image plate detector mounted on an RU 200 rotating anode generator at room temperature. The more modest resolution of the metal ion complex data is a direct result of soaking the crystals in the metal ion solutions. We have collected native data from crystals of similar size on the same detector to 2.0 A resolution. Data for the Mn 2 + complex were integrated with DENZO [51] and scaled with CCP4 programs [50]. 8332 reflections (89% of the unique data) were measured from 20-2.6 A. The multiplicity of measured data is 2.1 and R-merge is 7.0%. The model was refined using PROLSQ [57] to an R-value of 0.173. A single Mn2 + peak in the active site was observed in the initial Fnat-FMn difference Fourier maps and in our final Fo-F c difference Fourier maps with a contour height of 10a. The overall rms shift of the complex model compared with the native model is 0.55 A. The metal site has not been satisfactorily refined at 2.6 A due to the apparent anisotropic disorder. For this reason we do not report exact coordination distances of ligands nor water coordination to the metal site. We feel that higher resolution data are required to satisfactorily complete this analysis but that the significance and general conclusions are not compromised in the 2.6 A report given here. Modeling of template/primer and dNTP We first superimposed the MMLV RT palm domain with that of the HIV-1 RT-Fab-19/18mer oligonucleotide complex [23] including residues shown in Table 1. This allowed us to then superimpose model A-form DNA phosphorus coordinates on the experimentally determined phosphorus positions for the 19/18mer. Superposition of our model phosphorus coordinates on template phosphorus atoms 14-17 and primer phosphorus atoms 2-5 resulted in an rmsd of 0.78 A in TOSS [38]. Idealized model A-form DNA with a six base overhang was created in INSIGHT [39]. Parameters for the A-form DNA are the standard A-form DNA duplex parameters with a helical rise of 2.56 A per residue and a twist angle of -32.7 ° . The singlestrand overhang was modeled as A-form DNA, with small

torsion angles to avoid conadjustments made in the cr and flict with the protein, using CHAIN [58]. We have modeled dNTP binding by superimposing phosphorus coordinates from the ternary rat polymerase 3 structure [8] on the HIV-1 RT complex phosphorus coordinates using TOSS [38], including only two template and two primer phosphorus atoms from each model due to differences in oligonucleotide parameters in these structures. We then transformed oligonucleotide and ddCTP coordinates the rat polymerase and superimposed model dATP on ddCTP. We have used the phosphate coordinates from the transformed ddCTP in our model dATP.
