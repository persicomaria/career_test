Biological context The alkaline proteinase inhibitor (APRin) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an 11.5-kDa, high affinity, high specificity inhibitor of the serralysin class of zinc-dependent proteinases secreted by several Gram-negative bacteria (Feltzer et al. 2000). The inhibitor APRin is co-secreted from the bacterium presumably to prevent adventitious proteolysis of host proteins during the secretion process. The serralysins are mechanistically and structurally related to the matrix metalloproteinases (Morihara et al. 2000), and the active site zinc atom is accessible through a tunnel to the enzyme surface. These enzymes are capable of degrading a variety of host proteins and thereby enhance the pathogenicity of these organisms (Morihara and Homma 1985). The X-ray structure of the proteinase-APRin complex revealed that the five N-terminal inhibitor residues occupy the extended substrate binding site of the enzyme and that the terminal amino group (Ser) coordinates to the catalytic zinc of the enzyme (Hege et al. 2001). These residues are essential for inhibitor activity (Feltzer et al. 2000). However, there is no known structure of the free inhibitor, and the conformational properties of the N-terminal region of the protein are unclear (Feltzer et al. 2003). Metalloproteinase

inhibitors are of considerable biological interest as they are involved in regulating Zn metalloproteinase activity in numerous contexts including tissue destruction in pseudomonal infections, tumor metastases, and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Knowledge of the mechanism of action of these inhibitors could lead to new approaches to the preparation of therapeutically useful compounds for the treatment of these and other metalloproteinase-dependent diseases.

Methods and results Materials APRin was expressed as a fusion protein with the pelB signal peptide of E. coli using the IPTG-inducible plasmid pET22b+ (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified from the periplasm of E.coli BL21(DE3) cells as previously described (Feltzer et al. 2000). For 15N-labeled and 15N/13C-labeled protein, the method of Marley et al. (2001) was used. The growth medium was replaced by M9 minimal medium supplemented with (15NH4)2SO4 (1 g l-1) and 12C or 13C6 -1 D-glucose (4 g l ) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. Protein residues 6­10 were replaced with glycines as previously described (Feltzer et al. 2000).

Methods NMR spectroscopy For NMR, protein samples were prepared in 20 mM Na phosphate, 0.1 M KCl, pH 6.5. All NMR spectra were recorded in 5 mm Shigemi tubes at 25°C on 14.1 T or 18.8

T Varian Inova spectrometers. For the 15N/12C protein the concentration was 0.8 mM, and for the 15N/13C protein, the concentration was 1.7 mM. NMR Spectra of the 15Nlabeled Glycine variant were recorded at 0.9 mM. All NMR spectra were acquired in phase sensitive mode with solvent suppression by Watergate (Piotto et al. 1992). Spectra were processed using NMRPIPE (Delaglio et al. 1995). Prior to Fourier transformation the data were zero filled to increase resolution and a shifted sine-squared function was applied in all dimensions. Forward linear prediction was used to extend the time domain data in the 15 N and 13C dimensions. Spectra were analyzed using Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco). Structural restraints were derived from isotope-edited 2D and 3D 13C and 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra using mixing times of 100 and 150 ms. Backbone torsion angles were determined from the heteronuclear chemical shifts determined from triple resonance 3D experiments as described (Arumugam et al. 2005) using the program TALOS (Cornilescu et al. 1999) and from the intensities in the HNHB spectrum. These were used primarily to check the validity of the values estimated using TALOS (Cornilescu et al. 1999). Residual dipolar couplings were obtained using partially oriented samples with alkylPEG/hexanol (Ruckert and Otting 2000) and measuring the splittings in coupled HSQC spectra compared with the isotropic values. APRin contains a single disulfide between C26 and C49. Standard bond distances for C­S and S­S bond distances were used to constrain the disulfide linkage. Dynamical information was obtained by 15N relaxation measurements on the 15N-labeled sample. Spin-lattice (R1) and spin-spin (R2) relaxation rate constant were measured with suppression of dipole­dipole CSA cross-correlation effects (Kay et al. 1992). For the R1 measurements, 6 delays of 0.01, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 s were used and 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.09, 0.13 and 0.17 s for the R2 experiments, with relaxation delays of 3 and 2.7 s, respectively. The peak intensities were fitted to an exponential decay function. The heteronuclear NOE was measured by recording two interleaved spectra, one with saturation of the protons and the other without saturation. The relaxation delay for the 15N experiment was 3 s. Relaxation data were analyzed as described previously (McIntosh et al. 2000). The CSA contribution was calculated using an average value of 170 ± 17 ppm (Hall and Fushman 2006). Structure calculations Three-dimensional structures were calculated following established protocols using rMD with XPLOR-NIH

incorporating residual dipolar couplings (Schwieters et al. 2006). Briefly this comprised high temperature (2500 K) simulated annealing from an extended chain using 100 initial random number seeds, with a minimal force field. The temperature was gradually lowered (25 K per step) to 100 K and the relative strength of the restraints increased. The folded structures were then ordered according to potential energy and restraint violation energy. Residual dipolar couplings were introduced for improvement of the structures, and also as a check on the overall conformation. These rdc-checked structures were then finally refined by restrained energy minimization, and the top 20 were used for conformational analysis including distributions of torsion angles and Ramachandran analysis using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. 1996). The structures have been deposited to BMRB accession number 11015, PDB ID code 2rn4.

Structure 1700 distances were obtained using the isotope-separated NOESY spectra. In addition, 47 torsion angle restraints were derived from the combination of the database searching approach TALOS (Cornilescu et al. 1999) and intensity measurements. 83 residual dipolar couplings for NH vectors were obtained as described in the Methods. An additional 36 H-bond interactions were identified from slowly exchanging amide protons in D2O solution, NOEs and initial structure calculations, making a total of 1866 restraints (Table 1). As expected, the highest restraint density is in the core of the molecule, with a very low density for residues 1­8 and the two C-terminal residues. A family of solution structures that satisfied all of the experimental restraints was obtained using Xplor-NIH, including the residual dipolar couplings. The structures were ordered according to overall and potential energy, and the top 20 were accepted for further analysis. An overlay of the best 10 structures is shown in Fig. 1. The core of the molecule, (residues 8­105), shows a well-ordered conformation, with an rmsd to the mean structure of 0.88 ± ° 0.16 A for the backbone atoms. The stereochemistry is well defined, with no significant violations of restraints or poor energy terms. Overall there is good agreement between the solution and X-ray structures for the /, w and v1 angles of residues 8­100. The rmsd between the mean NMR structure ° and the X-ray structures for residues 8­105 is 0.92 A ° (backbone) and 1.5 A (all heavy atoms). Significant differences in the core are restricted to the loops Q19­A24, W53­S56, E72­L76, Q84­G87 and Q92­G96, as shown in Fig. 2.

Dynamics We have measured the 15N relaxation rates under the same conditions. The core of the molecule (8­105) shows on average a heteronuclear NOE of 0.85, with a tendency to increased scatter and lower values toward the C-terminal half of the molecule. The ratio R2/R1 for most residues was between 4 and 5, with a small number of outliers that

represent an exchange term (large R2, normal R1) e.g. residues 18, 50 and 95, or enhanced dynamics, cf. residues 6 and 25. The mean R2 value is 10 ± 2 s-1, and the NOE is near the maximum of 0.8 expected for a compact globular protein. Taken with the R1 and NOE values, and excluding the outliers, we estimate an effective rotational correlation time of 5 ± 0.5 ns, and low rotational anisotropy, consistent with the overall structure of the protein in solution. The rotational correlation time for hydrated sphere of molecular weight 11,400 is expected to be ca 5 ns at 298 K in water.

N-terminal arm The N-terminal arm, residues 1­8 did not display sharp resonances or NOEs expected of a highly dynamically disordered terminal region of a protein. Further, the backbone chemical shifts of these residues only approach random coil values at the extreme N-terminus. However, 12 NOES from the methyl group of Ala8 were assigned, including 6 long range NOEs to core residues P63, Y41 and W61. Both the affinity of the inhibitor for its target proteinase as well of the thermodynamic stability of the folded inhibitor are remarkably sensitive to the presence of the single-turn helix A (residues 8­11). For example, substitution of the wild-type -Ser6-Ala-Ser-Asp-Leu10-with five glycine residues results in a decrease of 1000-fold in affinity for the enzyme partner (Feltzer et al. 2000), a decrease in Tm of 8°C, and an increase in the DGo of unfolding of 6 kcal/mol (Gray et al. 2005). Figure 3 shows HSQC spectra of the wild type and the variant Glysubstituted protein. In the wild-type protein, the resonances for the N-terminal residues are weak or absent. However,

Fig. 3 HSQC of the Gly variant The 15N-1H HSQC spectra of wt and the glycine variant were recorded as described in the Methods. The resonances of the G6­10 substitution are circled

in the Gly substituted protein, sharp resonances for Gly appear in the HSQC spectrum in the expected positions, consistent with random coil values. This argues against the wild type having rapid NH exchange with the solvent, but rather a conformational exchange process on the ls-ms time scale or that the peptide in this region adopts a large number of conformations that do not exchange rapidly on the chemical shift time scale. There are additional changes in chemical shifts for residues remote from the N-terminus, including H27, L30, D32, S33, L34, G40, G45, A62, G67, A69, M79, L81, G 82, G87 and G94. This suggests that in the glycine variant N-terminal arm is dynamically disordered, whereas in the wild type, there is some interaction of the arm with this part of the protein core. Presumably this would have to be displaced for the arm to penetrate into the active site of the protease.

NMR data clearly rule out both of the extreme cases (i) and (ii), as these would give rise to highly characteristic NMR signatures (Wishart et al. 1995; Cornilescu et al. 1999). In the former case, the ordered extended chain (which would not be expected to be stable) would give rise to non-random 13C backbone chemical shifts and very characteristic NOE patterns (Cavanagh et al. 1996) that were not observed. In contrast, a random coil dynamically disordered on the sub-nanosecond timescale, would also give rise to characteristic 13C chemical shifts, very sharp resonances and characteristic NOE patterns (Dyson and Wright 2005), which again were not observed. Indeed, although the chemical shifts are close to random coil values, the intensity of the peaks in HSQC and triple resonance spectra was very low compared with similar residues in the core suggesting the possibility of a disordered, quasi extended chain, that does not adopt a unique conformation. This is consistent with a lack of observable long range NOEs from these residues. The Glycine variant increased the dynamic nature of the trunk adjacent to the first helix in the APRin, indicating that in the uncomplexed state the N-terminal arm may interact with the enzyme binding surface. This would imply that the enzyme effectively displaces the strand that enters the catalytic binding site and allows optimal contact between the two proteins. It is interesting in this regard that the truncated mutants and also the glycine variants have a substantially lower melting temperature than the wild type inhibitor, indicating stabilisation of the global fold by this protein region. This is further supported in part by detailed MD simulations based on the X-ray structures (Feltzer et al. 2003; R. D. Gray unpublished data).

Discussion and conclusions The core of the inhibitor, i.e. not including the N-terminal 8 residues (``trunk'') is similar to that observed in the complex with the alkaline protease. The binding surface with the enzyme includes the N-terminal trunk, which penetrates the active site to allow the N-terminal amino group to coordinate to the catalytic zinc atom. The net affinity of the intact protein for the enzyme is extremely high, Kd = 4 pM (Feltzer et al. 2003) and although truncation of the N-terminus cause a substantial loss in affinity(Feltzer et al. 2000), there remain numerous interactions with the b-sheet surface. What is not clear from the crystallography is the nature of the N-terminal trunk prior to binding. Is it (i) an extended chain, pre-organized to penetrate the protease active site, (ii) a completely dynamically disordered random coil, (iii) some other structure folded back on the core of the inhibitor, or, (iv) some combination of these.
