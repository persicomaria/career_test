1. Introduction Relatively high levels (i.e., up to 1% wet muscle wt) of a low-activity sulfonamide-resistant carbonic anhydrase isozyme has been reported from skeletal muscle of chicken, cat and sheep [ 11, ox [2], rabbit [3], mouse [4], human [8,9] and gorilla [7]. It has been accepted that these isozymes are all homologous forms of an enzyme designated CA111 and essentially confined to skeletal muscle. Nevertheless, trace levels of CA111 have also been detected immunologically in sheep lung 141,rabbit liver [4], and human liver, smooth muscle, lung and cardiac muscle [ 81. It now appears that high levels of a CA111 isozyme structurally indistinguishable from rat muscle CAR1 are also present in mature rat liver [9]. Utilizing an electrophoretic immunoassay [8] we report here the levels of CA111 different rat tissues. in

2.2. Immunoassay Assay of carbonic anhydrase III was carried out as described for human CA111[8]. Antiserum was prepared in New Zealand white rabbits using 3 sequential weekly injections of 1 mg CA111 Freund's complete in adjuvant, followed by an i.v. injection of 1 mg rat CA111 0.005 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). in Tissue extracts (20%, w/v) were prepared in distilled water and spun at 20 000 X g for 15 mm. Extracts from soleus, anterior tibialis (AT), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), prostate, white fat and liver were made as above. 2.3. SDS gel electrophoresis Protein subunits were separated in 12% acrylamide gels which were stained with Coomassie blue. 3. Results Rat muscle carbonic anhydrase III was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The protein profiles after SDS gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie blue are shown in fig.1. The mean levels of CAIII in extracts of different muscles are shown in fig.2. The range of values for the same muscles from different male rats showed consistent differences, e.g., for EDL, AT and soleus the mean values (&SD) were: (a) EDL 298 pg CAIII/g wet wt +63; (b) AT 1070 pg CAIII/g *247; (c) Soleus 12 925 l.(g CAIlI/g +248. Similar values were obtained from female muscle (fig.2). Extracts of liver were similarly analysed and the mean differences are summarised in fig.2. The mean CA111 level for male liver was 6975 pg CAIII/g wet wt k1435 and for female liver 256c(g CAIII/g wet wt +28. CA111 was also detected in white fat and a mean female value of 552 I.cg/gand a male value of 357 &g

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Purification of carbonic anhydrase III CA111 isozymes were initially prepared from rat skeletal muscle and liver homogenates by affinity chromatography on sulphonamide columns equilibrated with 0.01 M T&-SO4 (pH 8.7) and eluted with a O-O.4 M KCl gradient. Further purification was carried out on DEAE-32 cellulose columns equilibrated with 0.01 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) and eluted with a O-O.2 M NaCl gradient. Subsequent purification of the CA111 isozymes was carried out by passage through a Sephadex G-75 column equilibrated with 0.005 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). All stages of purification for the CA111 isozymes contained 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, as CA111 from human and rabbit muscle is known to dimerize.

cle, but the male/female ratio in liver is only 3: 1. A final paradox is the lack of induction of liver CAIII in castrated rats treated with testosterone, in contrast to other male related rat liver proteins such as cr2u globulin [ 111, which are coupled to testosterone control. Because of the high level of CA111 in liver and muscle it seems likely that the COZ hydrase activity of this isozyme is important. However the specific level of catalysis is in the order of 1% of carbonic anhydrase I, the low activity red cell isozyme. Enzymic functions, such as esterolytic or phosphatase activity have not yet been backed by any in vivo function of muscle or liver and the true role of this isozyme awaits explanation. References

wet wt were found. Trace levels of CA111 were also found in several other tissues, detectable only by radioimmunoassay (unpublished). 4. Diission The evidence for a single structure gene locus coding CA111 in most rat tissues is strong [9], and the variable expression of this locus in different muscle types and in male vs female liver is established by these data. If we compare male liver with female liver and soleus muscle (red, slow) with EDL (fast, white) muscle, the CA111 level is -30~times higher in the former tissue of each pair (tig.2). Whilst the levels of CA111 in male and female liver were found to be markedly different, homologous muscles from male and female gave similar levels (fig.2). In man, the CA111levels in soleus and gastrocnemius are similar (in contrast to the rat) and CA111 in liver is present only at trace levels [8]. In the mouse, CA111 is present in both male and female liver as well as mus266
