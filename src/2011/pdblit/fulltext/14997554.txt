Introduction. As a test case of structure-based functional analysis, we determined the three-dimensional (3D) structure of hypothetical protein PH1136 (14.7 kDa, 131 residues) from hyperthermophilic archaebacterium, Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 at 1.94 Å resolution by multiplewavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing. PH1136 is conserved among many organisms, mainly archaea and bacteria, and belongs to COG2050 in the database Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins1,2 (COGs website: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG). COGs consist of 43 complete genomes, representing 30 major phylogenetic lineages, and orthologous proteins have been divided into more than 3000 groups. In COG2050, there are 54 proteins from 23 organisms, and the functional annotation of this cluster is "uncharacterized protein, possibly involved in aromatic compounds catabolism." In addition, PH1136 shares about 20% sequence identity with the uncharacterized open reading frames (ORFs) CG16985 and CG16986 from Drosophila melanogaster. This conservation suggests that PH1136 and the members of COG2050 have some essential function for organisms. Materials and Methods. The PH1136 gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a genomic DNA of P. horikoshii, and the PCR amplicon was digested with NdeI and SalI and ligated into a pET-22b( ) vector (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed by using the Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3). Cells were grown in Luria­Bertani (LB) medium at 37°C. The cells were harvested (4000 g, 15 min at 4°C) and disrupted using French press at 1200 psi in sodium choloride-Tris-EDTA (STE) buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)] containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (40,000 g, 30 min at 4°C). The supernatant was incubated at 70°C for 30 min, then centrifuged (40,000 g, 30 min at 4°C). The supernatant was applied to a HiPrep 16/10 Q XL column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 1 mM EDTA), and proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 1.0 M NaCl. The fractions containing PH1136 were pooled and loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75pg column (Amersham Bioscience) equili©

brated with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The fractions containing PH1136 were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A and then applied to a RESOURCE Q column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 1.0 M NaCl. PH1136 was eluted as a single peak, and the fractions containing PH1136 were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. PH1136 was concentrated to 20 mg/mL by means of a centrifugal concentrator. For the production of selenomethionine (Se-Met) PH1136, cells were cultured in minimal medium containing Se-Met. The purification procedure for the Se-Met PH1136 was essentially the same as the native protein. The crystallized condition for PH1136 consists of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 ­9.0 and 2.0 ­2.8 M ammonium sulfate, and crystals were grown to a size of 0.1 0.1 0.1 mm at 4°C within a few days. The crystals of Se-Met PH1136 were produced under the same conditions. X-ray diffraction data of Se-Met PH1136 were collected to 1.94 Å resolution at the BL45XU in SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The crystal of Se-Met PH1136 belongs to the space group P3121 with the cell dimensions a b 57.5 Å, c 79.6 Å, and 120°, and an asymmetric unit contains one PH1136 molecule. MAD data were collected using three different wavelengths (0.9785, 0.9791, and 0.9000 Å) from a single crystal of Se-Met PH1136 under cryogenic condition (100 K) after it was soaked in cryoprotectant solution with 37% (w/v) sucrose. The data were integrated and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK.3 All selenium sites were located by SOLVE,4 and heavy-atom parameters were re-

fined and phase calculation was carried out using SHARP.5 Initial phases were improved by solvent flattening with SOLOMON6 using the procedure in SHARP. The atomic model was built automatically by using ARP/wARP,7 and the structure refinement was carried out with CNS.8 The summary of data statistics is presented in Table I. Results and Discussion. The final model of PH1136 includes 130 out of 131 residues, plus 89 water molecules [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 1IXL]. Because of the poor electron density, the atomic model of C-terminal residue Asn131 was not built. The structure is an fold consisting of 2 -helices and 6 -strands. The secondary structure elements are ordered as follows: 1- 2- 1- 2- 34- 5- 6. Six -strands form an antiparallel -sheet that wraps around the central long -helix ( 2) constructed by 16 residues. This long -helix is highly hydrophobic, and only 3 (Thr51, Asp56, and Tyr57) of 16 residues that make up this helix are polar. A search using the DALI9 server showed that PH1136 belongs to the "hot-dog" fold, so named because of its appearance: the central long -helix looks like a sausage, and the -sheet wraps around this helix like a bun. Four enzymes, 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterases10 ­12 from Pseudomonas and Arthrobacter, -hydroxydecanoyl thiol ester dehydrase13 from E. coli, and (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase14 from Aeromonas caviae, belong to this fold. The active sites of these four enzymes are formed by their dimerization. The active site is a hydrophobic, tunnelshaped pocket located at a monomer­monomer interface, and two active sites exist per dimer. The substrates of the structural neighbors of PH1136 are hydrophobic acylthioesters, which bind to the inner side of their tunnelshaped hydrophobic pockets. In the crystal of PH1136, there is only one PH1136 monomer per asymmetric unit, but the dimer structures formed by the crystallographic 2-fold rotational axis are similar to the dimer of 4 structural neighbors [Fig. 1(a)]. We also found, in a gel filtration experiment, that PH1136 is a homodimer. The dimer of PH1136 also forms two hydrophobic tunnel-shaped pockets resembling those of structural neighbors [Fig. 1(b)].

Each pocket begins at the subunit interface between strands 3 and 3 [see Fig. 1(a)] and heads toward the central long -helix. At about 10 Å from the entrance, each pocket turns sharply and runs parallel to the central long -helix for about 10 Å. These observations suggest that PH1136 acts as an enzyme with some hydrophobic substrate, possibly acyl-thioester. Most catalytic residues of the proteins that are part of the hot-dog fold gather on the loop located upstream of the central long -helix. In the case of PH1136, this putative active loop consists of 9 residues, with charged residues being Lys39, Asp41, Glu42, Lys43, and His47. Furthermore, side-chains of only 2 residues (Asp41 and His47) head toward the inner side of the pocket. Asp41 is at the end of the pocket, and His47 is at the center of this pocket. If no dynamic structural changes occur in binding of its substrate, one or both of these residues would act as catalytic residues. From the result of multiple sequence alignment of PH1136 and 7 sequence homologs, His47 is completely conserved (Fig. 2). This suggests the importance of His47 for either the activity or structural stability of PH1136 and these homologous proteins. Acknowledgments. We thank Y. Kawano and H.
