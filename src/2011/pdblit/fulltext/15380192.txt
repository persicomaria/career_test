Abstract: Simultaneus arallel syntheses at distinct sitins n a membrane surt is exemlified with the rearatin f series f redefined, shrt etide sequences (1). Cellulse aer sheets are used as absrtive membranes . Petides are assembled by manual r autmated stting f small aliquts f slutins cntaining the activated amin acid derivatives nt marked sitins n the sheets . The alicatin f this methd t raid eite analysis is demnstrated.

INTRODUCTION Exlring the immense diversity f mlecular structures accessible t lig- and lymeric bimlecules such as rteins and nucleic acids by new techniques in mlecular bilgy and chemical synthesis has generated cnsiderable excitement . In articular, the systematic screening f extensive series f shrt etide sequences in bilgical assay systems has becme a werful arach fr the investigatin f rtein-rtein interactins . The mechanism f binding between ligands and rteins such as enzymes, recetrs and antibdies can be studied at the mlecular level and new bilgically active sequences are being identified . At resent, there are rincially tw different ways t generate defined sets f etide sequences fr binding exeriments : the genetic and the synthetic arach . The first includes clning and bacterial exressin f randm DNA fragments as fusin-rtein r fusin-hase fllwed by selectin in a binding assay and sequence analysis f sitive clnes (2,3,4) . The secnd relies n arriate methds f simultaneus multile etide synthesis (§MPS) t ce with the large number f different sequences required . In recent years, several simultaneus synthesis techniques have been develed (fr a brief review see Ref. 5) . T date, the mst efficient synthetic arach is the "in-methd" by Geysen et al. (6) in which etides are synthesised n the ti f lyacrylate grafted lyethylene rds arranged in an 8x12 micrtiter late array . Recently, Fdr et al . (7) rerted n the light directed, satially addressable, arallel synthesis f a cmbinatrial set f 1024 etides n nly a 1 .6mm x 1 .6mm area f a micrsce glass slide . In general, small quantities (fml t )Acl) f etides are sufficient fr the functinal assays . Sluble as well as immbilised etides are f equal imrtance . The synthetic arach ffers the additinal tin t include structural elements ther than the natural L-amin acids . Thus, each f the rerted techniques has its articular features which makes it secially suited fr certain tyes f exeriments, althugh there is cnsiderable verla . Ease f handling, availability f devices and degree f autmatin are ther imrtant criteria. In the fllwing article, a nvel technical cncet fr the slid hase surted simultaneus arallel synthesis is described (8) suitable fr bth manual as well as autmated eratin . This technique has been elabrated fr the rearatin f series f etide sequences at the 50 nml scale, utilising cnventinal

Fmc/tBu chemistry (5) . The methd is extremely simle, raid, ecnmic in the use f reagents, and ffers much flexibility with regard t synthesis scale and use f the etides . It is anticiated that ng t mg quantities f several thusand hexa- t ctaetides can be reared n ne wrking day . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Princile f the Technique

The basic cncet came frm the bservatin that during etide syntheses n cellulse discs, amin acid culing reactins can rceed smthly and t cmletin, when nly enugh slutin is used as can be taken u by the surt matrix . This has been rerted by ther authrs wrking with cellulse r cttn carriers (9). Instead f using searate ieces (e .g. discs) f aer fr individual etides, this bservatin suggested that different culing reactins culd be carried ut simultaneusly n distinct areas f the same sheet f aer . By disensing f small vlumes f slutins circular sts shuld frm resulting frm absrtin int the matrix ; vlumes and sitins can be calibrated s that neighbring sts d nt verla . Indeed, this turned ut t be nt nly racticable, but a technically very simle arach fr the simultaneus arallel assembly f large numbers f different etides . The st size is determined by the vlume disensed, the absrtive rerties f the aer material, and the vlatility f the slvent . Accrding t the secific functinality f the aer surt, the st size crrelates with a articular scale f etide synthesis . The st size als directs the minimal distance between st sitins and thus the number f sts that can be distributed nt a given aer sheet (Fig . 1) . Sme tyical data fr tw tyes f aer qualities are shwn in Table 1 . Manual stting is ractically feasible with vlumes dwn t 0.1µl using an rdinary micr-iette . Cmmercial x/y-rgrammable TLC-stters r ietting wrkstatins are erfect devices fr autmated erfrmance f st synthesis . Vlumes dwn t 10 nl can be recisely delivered t any sitin and several thusand etides may be reared n a reasnably small sheet . Many mre etides er unit area can be reared by the htlithgrahic technique f Fdr et al. (7), this, hwever, requires extensive instrumentatin . Furthermre, even n the smallest sts (10 nl) each etide is still rduced in nml quantities sufficient fr islatin and full characterisatin . Table 1 .

The articular features f cellulse aer (10,11) enabled the realisatin f this technique althugh ther chemically resistant membranes might wrk equally well . The easy and stable marking with a encil hels t unambiguusly address any sitin during manual assembly f sequences . The etides can be used immbilised n the surt in a slid hase binding assay . Alternatively, the sts can be unched ut and the etides cleaved fr use in slutin . The ready availability f many aer qualities ermits the chice f the necessary rerties (mechanical stability, thickness) accrding t the secial requirements f the assay .
Prearatin f the Surt In a first attemt, the st technique was develed as an arach fr raid antibdy binding studies with etides immbilised at the st sitins . Fr this analytical urse, a surt material is required with nly a lw functinality er unit f area but which des nt interfere with the binding assay, thus a thin

aer with timal washing characteristics such as a ure cellulse chrmatgrahy aer . The size f the aer sheet as well as the arrangement f the sts can be chsen t suit the investigatrs wn articular requirements . Immunlgists, fr examle, may refer a micrtiter late frmat with 8x12 sts (Fig . 1A,B). An arriate sheet f aer is cut ut and the sitins fr the sts marked with a encil at a distance accrding t the chsen st size (see Table 1) . The aer sheet needs t be chemically derivatised t intrduce suitable anchr functins fr etide synthesis at the st sitins . These anchrs als serve as sacer arms t imrve the accessibility f the immbilised etides . One ssible rute is shwn in Figure 2 . In a first ste (A) an even distributin f mre reactive amin functins is generated by the esterificatin f an aN-rtected amin acid derivative t the hydrxyl grus f the cellulse fllwed by the cleavage f the rtecting gru . In a secndste (B), anther amin acid is culed t these amin functins, but nw nly small aliquts as chsen frm Table 1 f a slutin cntaining the crresnding activated derivative are ietted nt the encil ints . NMP (b. . 203 °C) is used as slvent because f its lw vlatility. All residual amin functins n the sheet are then blcked by acetylatin and the N-terminus f the dietide anchr is released . Free amin functins n the aer are visualised by staining with the brmhenl blue indicatr (BPB) disslved in DMF and aear as distinct blue sts (Fig . 1A) . Initially, Fmc-glycine was used in bth derivatisatin stes . Hwever, a

cnsiderable rtin f the Gly-Gly anchr were lst un Fmc dertectin with ieridine in DMF and strage, mst rbably via diketierazine frmatin . Furthermre, the Gly-Gly tail f the etides seems t interfere with antibdy binding and sme sera bind nn-secifically t Ac-Gly-Gly . Fmc-BAIa is a better chice (Fig . 2) : B-alanine is a nn-rteingenic amin acid, the BAla-BAla anchr is nt rne t selfcatalysed hydrlysis, and the sacer arm is lnger . Carbdiimide mediated esterificatin f an Fmc-amin acid in the resence f NMI as chsen fr ste A is the mst critical reactin f the derivatisatin rcess described . Yields can vary cnsiderably deending n the quality f reagents and technical erfrmance . With resect t the use in antibdy binding assays, functinality f the aer shuld be hmgeneus and in an timal windw between 10 t 20 uml/g . Higher ladings may cause aggregatin f certain etide sequences and thus imair the access by the antibdy, while lwer ladings will reduce the sensitivity f the assay. A secial membrane timised and tested fr antibdy binding studies is cmmercially available . T allw fr cleavage f the etides frm the surt a cleavable handle may be incrrated int the anchr. A large variety f anchr cnfiguratins knwn frm the literature are available, the chice f which deending n the final frm f the etides (5) . In rder t avid chrmatgrahic urificatin f the etides, the linkage t the surt is cleaved nly after all chemicals frm the dertectin ste have been washed ff. In the case f the Bc-Lys-Pr anchr described by Bray et al . (12), the etide is released int neutral hshate buffer via diketierazine frmatin . This anchr is similarly intrduced as sts n the aer when using Fmc-Pr in ste A and Bc-Lys(Fmc) in ste B (Fig . 2) . The scale f synthesis can be easily increased t theµml range using a thicker aer such as Whatman 3MM. Fllwing the same rcedure as abve, reswllen (dilute TFA in DCM, 10) 3MM aer was aminated in ste A t 1 .2 ml er cm2. St sizes and functinalities are given in Table 1 . U t threefld higher ladings can be achieved by emlying mre efficient culing reagents such as 1-mesitylenesulfnyl3-nitr-1,2,4-triazlide MSNT (11,14) .
Assembly f Petides

Crrect and raid erfrmance f the many ietting eratins during assembly f large numbers f etides requires the hel f an arriate cmuter rgram . A cmfrtable windw-driven SPOTs TM sftware has been written (15) which allws easy retrieval and editing f sequence files and ffers several tins t generate series f etide sequences (Fig . 3). Petides t be synthesised are rdered under cnsecutive numbers which refer t the crresnding numbers f the sts n the aer sheet . The rgram calculates the sum f all amin acid additins (amin acid usage) which hels t estimate the vlumes f stck slutins needed t cmlete the whle synthesis . Fr each synthesis cycle (simultaneus elngatin f all etides by ne amin acid residue) a listing f st numbers t which a articular amin acid derivative has t be delivered is then given . This listing is used as ietting scheme fr manual stting r may cntrl the ietting autmat . An arriate art f the riginal sheet, which carries the number f sts required, may be cut ut . The sts are marked with the etide numbers with a encil (see Fig . IA); any ther cde may be written nt the margin r back f the sheet fr identificatin f the exeriment . Fllwing the ietting scheme, aliquts f slutins f Fmc-amin acid Pf-esters in NMP are stted (Fig . 4) . These aliquts are ket slightly larger than thse alied in the derivatisatin ste B in rder t cver the st cmletely . Fr the slw culing derivatives f valine, isleucine and threnine the resective Fmc-amin acid N-carbxy anhydrides (NCAs) may be used . The BPB staining n the sts enables the eratr t visually mnitr the

time curse f individual culing reactins by a clr change frm blue t yellw (13, Fig . 1B) . In case f incmlete culings, an additinal aliqut may be added after 15 min . Culing reactins are sted by raid washing with dilute acetic anhydride in DMF . The stes cmrising ne full cycle f amin acid additin are listed in Table 2 . Cycle time can be less than 1 h and hexa- t ctaetides can be reared n ne wrking day . When etides f different length are t be reared, sme chains are finished earlier than thers because all etides n ne sheet are started tgether . If a larger gru f these is lcated n a distinct art f the sheet, this may simly be cut ff after cmletin f these chains . Otherwise, these sts may be blcked in the fllwing cycle by stting acetic anhydride in NMP . If a free terminal amin gru f the

etides is required, the last amin acids f the shrter chains are culed as their aN-Bc rtected derivatives. After the final cycle, etides can be N-terminally acetylated with acetic anhydride . Cleavage f side chain rtecting grus is accmlished by treatment with ne f the acidic ccktails based n TFA/DCM (1 :1). Particularly gd results have been btained with 3% triisbutylsilane and 2% water as scavengers . Syntheses at the nml scale require nly very small vlumes f slutins f activated amin acid derivatives . In rder t minimise the effrt in the rearatin f these slutins, the stability f Fmc-amin acid Pf-esters and NCAs in NMP slutin was investigated . 0.3 M stck slutins were reared and 100 µl aliquts stred frzen at -70°C . TLC analysis and culing efficiency cnfirmed that these frzen stcks can be used safely fr at least ne mnth and are stable at rm temerature fr at least ne wrking day . The nly excetin is Arginine whse derivatives frm 6-lactames . Slutins f Arg-derivatives are freshly reared. SPOT synthesis is articularly ecnmic in use f slvents and reagents . On average, sme 50 t 90 mg f amin acid derivatives and 2,5 t 3 liters f DMF are required fr the assembly f 96 15mers .
Antibdy Binding Assay

The mst frequent alicatin f the etide screening arach is the analysis f sequential antibdy binding sites, r cntinuus eites (17, 18) . Overlaing etides sanning an entire rtein sequence r regin f knwn immune reactivity are reared t lcalise eite sitins . These can be further analysed with substitutin r deletin analgues t determine the cntributin f each individual amin acid residue t the recgnitin rcess . Antibdy binding t a rtein r etide antigen is mst frequently identified by an enzyme-linkedimmunsrbent-assay (ELISA, Fig . 5), althugh ther labelling techniques emlying radiactive istes r flurescent dyes are adequate (19). In the case f etides immbilised as sts n a aer sheet, standard enzyme-cnjugate/chrmgen cmbinatins which frm water insluble clred rducts can be used . As a result, clred sts aear at the sitins f binding . The dye and adsrbed rteins n the sheet can be remved by washing with rganic slvents and detergents (striing) which allws the etides t be reacted

Althugh less sensitive, a B-galactsidase cnjugated secnd antibdy and 5-brm-4-chlr-3-indlyl-B-D-galactyranside (BCIG r XGAL) as substrate (chrmgen) were chsen because f the mild, nn-destructive reactin cnditins which imrve multile re-use f aer-bund etides.

The CMV26-sequence was devided int 49 decaetides with an ffset f ne amin acid residue and these were synthesised, as described abve, n a BAla-BAla derivatised sheet with an array f 10x5 sts.

Figure 6 shws the result btained when rbing the etides with the rabbit anti-CMV26 serum in an ELISA as described abve . Tw series f etides reacted mst strngly, invlving decaetides 11 t 16, with the cmmn sequence mtif SLSSL and decaetides 30 t 33, with the cmmn sequence mtif LDNDLMN. These tw dminant eites had been identified befre by indeendent methds (20): 1 . binding t verlaing ctaetides synthesised n cellulse discs (11) and bltted nt a nyln membrane ; 2 . binding t immbilised verlaing decaetides synthesised n the tis f glass rds . The SLSSL eite regin was then analysed in mre detail by synthesising etide series f different length including alanine substitutin analgues (Fig . 7) . The decaetides N . 1 t 10 are identical t thse f N. 9 t 18 f Figure 6 and give the same result . St N . 10 dislays a yellw t reddish clr and thus is n false sitive signal. Such signals were frequently bserved with etides having basic residues, histidine in this case . This culd be attributed t a nn-secific side reactin in the resence f tassium ferricyanide(III) which has been used initially as a mild xidant fr the frmatin f the indig dye frm the indxyl recursr .

Lin. The best results were btained with thiazlyl blue tetrazlium brmide (MTT) which, in additin, frms a dark vilet frmazan that als imrves the sensitivity f the assay . All shrter etide series clearly cnfirm that SLSSL is the shrtest sequence recgnised by the antibdy . The signal resnse is indeendent f the length f the etide and the sitin f the eite within the etide . Thus, the BAla-BAla sacer is lng enugh t allw efficient binding f the antibdy, even when the eite sequence is directly attached t it (Fig . 7, st N . 43) . This is als true fr the alanine substitutin analgues . All three series give the same result, e .g . the first and furth sitin f the eite sequence can be relaced by Ala . In rder t rve that differential clr develment is a result f secific binding and nt due t a variatin f etide quality, the CMV26 hexaetide series (Fig . 7, sts N . 36 t 39) was reeated n a Bc-Lys-Pr derivatised sheet and the etides were eluted carrying a C-terminal diketierazine miety (12) . Figure 8 gives sme analytical data f these etides . All were nearly hmgeneus by HPLC, crrect in their sequences as rven by FAB-MS and amin acid analyses, and btained in almst equal yields . Cnclusins The st-synthesis is a technically very easy and straightfrward methd . The quality f the etides reared by this methd is remarkably gd and sufficient fr mst bilgical studies . Petides u t 20 residues in length have been successfully reared . In antibdy binding assays, identical results t ther established methds are btained . The develment f the st-methd was very much insired by the successful PEPSCAN methd f Geysen et al . (6) which uses arrays f lyethylene rds with lyacrylate grafted tis. The st-methd rvides a simler, mre ecnmic and raid access t large numbers f shrt etide sequences at the nml t ml scale fr bilgical screening urses . Mrever, it ffers a high degree f flexibility cncerning arrangement, scale and number f syntheses er area f surting aer sheet . Miniaturisatin shuld allw t accmdate u t a hundred sts er 1 cm 2 and several thusand etides may be screened n a reasnably small sheet . Like ther arallel SMPS techniques, it lends itself t autmatin . Wrk in this directin is in rgress . At resent, the alicatin f st-synthesis in ther areas f etide research is being tested, such as in the analysis f the sequence secificity f rtein mdifying enzymes, the screening f hrmne derived etide mimetica etc . In rincile, the st technique shuld als be alicable t the stewise arallel assembly f ther ligmers, e .g. lignucletides, rvided that the chemistry allws such a simle handling f reagents . EXPERIMENTAL General Methds Chemicals and slvents are f the highest available urity and urchased frm varius cmmercial surces. Brmhenl blue (E. Merck, Darmstadt) is disslved in DMF t 10 mg/ml and this slutin is used as a stck fr staining f amin functins . NMI was distilled frm slid NaOH and stred in a tightly clsed flask ver mlecular sieve 4A (NMI is hygrscic!) . NMP was treated with mlecular sieve (4A) until a 1 ml aliqut yielded a bright yellw clr un the additin f 5 µl BPB stck. Cellulse aer (lChr, 3MM) was btained as 46 x 57 cm sheets frm Whatman (Maidstne, England) . Fmc/tBu rtected amin acid derivatives are frm Nvabichem (Laufelfingen, Switzerland) and the crresnding HOBt-esters are reared in-situ by reactin with 1 .5 eq. HOBt and 1 .2 eq .

amin acid NCAs frm Pretide (Vert-le-Petit, France) . They are disslved in NMP at a cncentratin f 0.3 M and stred frzen at -70°C as 0 .1 ml aliquts in screw-ca lastic tubes . Slutins f arginine derivatives were always freshly reared . Secial side chain rtectin : Arg(Pmc), Cys(Trt) r Cys(Acm), His(Bc) . The gat-anti-rabbit B-galactsidase cnjugated secndary antibdy was btained frm Suthern Bitechnlgy Assciates Inc . (Birmingham, USA) and used as recmmended by the sulier . Slutins f Fmc-amin acid Pf-esters are rutinely checked by TLC n lates f silica gel 60 F-254 frm E . Merck (Darmstadt, FRG) with ethyl acetate as slvent and shuld cntain n baseline material . HPLC-searatins were carried ut n an analytical reversed-hase silica gel clumn (Nuclesil 300-7C18, 4x250 mm, Macherey-Nagel, Ddren, FRG) with gradients f acetnitrile/0 .1 % TFA in water/0 .1 % TFA ; flw was 1 ml/min . - Mass sectra were recrded n a Krats MS 50RF with a high field magnet (mass range ca. 10 .000 at 8 kV) and a Krats FAB surce using a beam f neutral xenn atms at 8-9 kV and thiglycerl as matrix . Peak fractins frm HPLC searatins cntaining 5 t 10,ug etide were evarated t dryness, disslved in 3 ul DMSO and aliquts theref were injected int the thiglycerl matrix . - Amin acid analyses were carried ut n a Bitrnik LC200 . - Snicatin was carried ut in a water bath frm Bandelin electrnic (Berlin, FRG) tye Snrex Suer RK510H . - UV/VIS extinctin cefficients were measured with a Zeiss PMQII sectrhtmeter . - Amin functins n aer sheets were quantified by a mdified ninhydrin assay as described (11) .
Derivatisatin f Paer Sheets

Ste A : Paer sheets f required size and rerty are cut ut frm larger cmmercial sheets and the st sitins are marked with a encil at a distance accrding t the chsen st size (Table 1) . The sheets are dried vernight under vacuum in a desiccatr and then reacted fr 3 h in a clsed cntainer with a slutin cntaining 0 .2 M Fmc-amin acid, 0 .24 M DIC, and NMI in DMF . The slutin shuld be cmletely taken u by the aer (e .g. 2 ml/100 cm2 fr lChr, 4 ml/100 cm 2 fr 3MM) . The quality and cncentratin f NMI largely determine the yield (area secific functinalisatin) f this reactin . Fr analytical antibdy binding exeriments the required lw functinality (0 .1 t 0 .2 µml/cm2 n lChr) is achieved when reacting Fmc-B-alanine in the resence f an equal cncentratin f NMI . Fr rearative synthesis f slutin hase etides Fmc-rline is reacted in the resence f the duble cncentratin f NMI which yields a functinality f 0.4 t 0 .6 µml/cm2 n lChr and 1 .2 t 1 .4,uml/cm2 n 3MM . After 3 washes with DMF, treatment with 20% ieridine in DMF fr 20 min, three mre washes with DMF, and tw washes with ethanl, the sheets are dried under vacuum in a desiccatr . Ste B : (tyical rcedure f the manual versin fr a 96 st micrtiter frmat n lChr) All chemical stes are carried ut with a aer sheet frm ste A laced in a flat, 10 x 14 cm wide and 1 cm dee, inert lastic tray . A glass late is used as a cver. Liquids are asirated with a lyrylene iette ti munted n a lyrylene tubing and cnnected via a 2 1 suctin flask t a vacuum line . Unless therwise stated, 15 ml rtins f slvents and slutins are used and the tray is gently agitated n a rcker late fr 2 min . A slutin (100 Id er sheet) cntaining 0 .3 M HOBt-ester f Fmc-B-alanine in NMP is reared and 0 .5 µl aliquts stted, with a iette, nt each f the 96 encil ints nt a B-Ala derivatised sheet frm ste A . After 20 min, the sheet is washed twice with 2% acetic anhydride in DMF and residual amin functins are further acetylated by treatment with 2 % acetic anhydride, 1 % diisrylethylamine in DMF fr 30 min . Further washings and Fmc cleavage are carried ut as listed in Table 2 . Free amin functins n the sheet are stained with 1 % BPB stck in DMF and aear as distinct blue sts (Fig . la) . Similarly, Lys-Pr

derivatised sheets are reared using Pr-laded sheets f lChr r 3MM frm ste A and stting a slutin f 0 .3 M HOBt-ester f Bc-Lys(Fmc)-OH in NMP. Fr the exeriment described in Figure 8, an array f 10 x 7 sts generated by stting 1 l aliquts at a distance f 1 cm n lChr aer has been used . Fr ther aer sizes and st arrangements vlumes f slvents and slutins as well as dimensins f the tray shuld be adated in such a way as t kee cnsumtin f chemicals t a minimum . Stability f anchr functins n derivatised aer was tested after incubatin ver rlnged times in sealed lastic bags at varius temeratures by determining the amunt f aer bund amin grus with the ninhydrin assay .
Assembly f Petides

Technical details are as abve in ste B and all stes cmrising ne cycle f amin acid additin are listed in Table 2. Fllwing a ietting scheme as shwn in Figure 3, e .g. 0.7 t 0.91d aliquts f 0 .3 M slutins f activated Fmc-amin acid derivative in NMP are ietted nt the blue sts f a 96 micrtiter frmatted sheet . This crresnds t abut a 3-fld excess ver amin grus n the sts . Culing reactins are fllwed by clr change f the sts frm blue t yellw (Figure lb) . With incmlete culings, an additinal aliqut may be added after 15 min r a duble stting may be erfrmed rutinely . N-terminal caing f shrter etide chains within a nrmal elngatin cycle is achieved by stting 0 .4 M acetic anhydride in NMP nt the resective sts . The numbers f these are listed in an extra line f the ietting schedule . After the final cycle, etides may be acetylated with 2 % acetic anhydride in DMF fr 20 min fllwing ste 8 f Table 2 . Cmlete acetylatin is indicated by the disaearance f the blue BPB clr . The aer sheet is then washed twice with DMF, twice with ethanl, and dried . Cleavage f side chain rtecting grus is accmlished by immersing the dry sheet int 20 ml f 50% TFA, 3% triisbutylsilane and 2% water in DCM (all V/V) fr 2 h with the tray tightly clsed t avid evaratin . Chemicals are washed ut with DCM (fur times), DMF (three times) and ethanl (twice) . The sheet may be dried, sealed in a lastic bag and stred at -20°C r is further rcessed as belw under "antibdy binding assay" . Petides synthesised n e-Lys-Pr anchrs are eluted by a mdified rcedure f Bray et al . (12) . After the DCM washes fllwing the TFA dertectin ste (abve), the sheet is further washed by snicating three times fr 15 min in methanl/water (1 :1) cntaining 0 .1 % HCl and twice in 1 M acetic acid . The sheet is then dried under vacuum in a desiccatr, the sts are cut r unched ut and transferred individually t arriately sized lyrylene tubes (Eendrf) . The etides are cleaved frm the surts by shaking vernight in 0 .5 ml 0 .05 M triethylammnium acetate (H 7) cntaining 20% dixane . The suernatants are transferred t anther tube and lyhilised . The residues were disslved in 0 .5 ml water cntaining 10% acetnitrile and 0 .1 % TFA . Aliquts were injected nt a RP-HPLC clumn and eak fractins cllected fr FAB-MS and amin acid analyses .
Antibdy binding assay

The sheet frm the last wash f the dertectin rcedure, still in ethanl, is laced int a clean lystyrene tray (e .g. cver f a micrtiter late) . 10 ml rtins f slutins are used and remved by decantatin . The tray is cvered with a glass late and gently agitated n a rcker late fr ten min r as indicated. Buffer slutins used were : TBS (8 g NaCl, 0 .2 g KC1, 6 .1 g Tris ·base er liter, adjusted t H 7 with HCI) ; T-TBS (TBS lus 0 .05 % Tween 20) ; PBS (8 g NaCl, 0 .2 g KCI, 1 .43 g Na2HPO4.2H2O, 0 .2 g KH2PO4 er liter, adjusted t H 7 with HCI); a suitable blcking buffer (H 7-7 .5) .

antibdy binding . The aer membrane generally gives n backgrund but sme etides n the sts may shw a strng crssreactivity with the secndary antibdy-enzyme cnjugate . Fr each series f etides and secndary antibdy cnjugate the timal blcking cnditins have t be evaluated . There are many frmulatins available fr blcking buffers (19); best results have been btained with tw cmmercial recies : membrane blcking reagent frm Cambridge Research Bichemicals (Nrthwich, UK) r SuerBlck Blcking Buffer-Bltting frm Pierce (Rckfrd, USA) . The fllwing series f incubatins is carried ut : TBS (3-times), blcking buffer (vernight), T-TBS (nce), the test antibdy r antiserum diluted in blcking buffer (2 t 4h), T-TBS (twice), a B-galactsidase cnjugated secnd antibdy diluted in blcking buffer (1 t 2h), T-TBS (twice), and PBS (twice) . The sheet is then transferred t a glass tray and treated with the chrmgen slutin (3 mg BCIG, 3 mM tassium ferricyanide(III) r 4 .5 mg MIT, 5 mM MgC12 in 10 ml BPS, 10 t 30 min) . (CAUTION : MTT is txic and may cause heritable genetic damage!) Psitive sts devel a blue/vilet clr . Staining is sted by washing with PBS . The sheet is stred at 4°C in PBS cntaining 0 .05 % sdium azide. It is recmmended t assay first nly the enzyme cnjugated secndary antibdy fr unsecific binding! Remval f bund antibdies and dye (striing) is achieved by successive washing with the fllwing slutins: water (twice), DMF (three times, the secnd wash under snicatin as lng as needed t cmletely disslve the dye), water (three times), slutin A [8 M urea, 1 % SDS, 0 .1% mercatethanl adjusted t H 7 with acetic acid] (three times with snicatin at 40 °C), slutin B [20% acetic acid, 50% ethanl in water] (three times), ethanl (twice) . The sheet may then be re-used fr antibdy binding as described abve r dried with an air dryer, sealed in a lastic bag and stred at -20°C . Because f the lability twards hydrlysis f the ester linkage between the cellulse and the dietide anchr, the H f all buffer slutins used fr antibdy binding and striing shuld be 5 7 .5.
