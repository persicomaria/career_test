ABSTRACT: ALY is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein which interacts with proteins such as TAP that are involved in export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, as well as with proteins that bind the T cell receptor R gene enhancer. ALY has also been shown to bind mRNA and to co-localize in the nucleus with components of a multiprotein postsplicing complex that is deposited 20-24 nucleotides upstream of exon-exon junctions. ALY has a conserved RNA binding domain (RBD) flanked by GlyArg rich N-terminal and C-terminal sequences. We determined the solution structure of the RBD homology region in ALY by nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The RBD motif in ALY has a characteristic sheet composed of four antiparallel strands and two R helices 1R1 2- 3R2 4 fold, consisting of a that pack on one face of the sheet. As in other RBD structures, the sheet has an exposed face with hydrophobic and charged residues that could modulate interactions with other molecules. The loop that connects strands 2 and 3 is in intermediate motion in the NMR time scale, which is also characteristic of other RBDs. This loop presents side chains close to the exposed surface of the sheet and is a primary candidate site for intermolecular interactions. The structure of the conserved RBD of ALY provides insight into the nature of interactions involving this multifunctional protein.

ALY (ally of AML-1 and LEF-1 proteins)1 (1), also known as REF1-I (RNA and export factor binding-I) (2) and BEF (bZIP enhancing factor) (3), is a nuclear protein which was originally proposed to play an essential role in the activation of the T-cell receptor R gene (TCRR) enhancer by interacting with the transcription factors AML-1 and LEF-1 (1). Other studies have shown that ALY exhibits chaperone function. Through direct interaction with basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, ALY enhances binding of bZIP factors to DNA (3). Since the TCRR enhancer contains a binding site for the ATF family of bZIP proteins, ALY may be an important factor in facilitating the formation of a higher order nucleoprotein complex on the TCRR enhancer. ALY is a member of the REF family of proteins and interacts with the mRNA export factor TAP, facilitating its interaction with cellular mRNAs (2, 4). ALY itself exhibits

RNA binding activity and may act as an RNA chaperone by modulating the formation of RNA-protein and RNA-RNA complexes (2, 4). Recently, it was reported that ALY is a component of the general mRNA export machinery (5). ALY co-localizes with splicing factors in the nucleus, shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm to increase the rate and efficiency of mRNA export (6). ALY is found in a multiprotein postsplicing complex, also known as the exon junction complex (EJC) (7) with SRm160, DEK, RNPS1, Y14, and Magoh (8, 9). ALY interacts with pre-mRNA prior to spliceosome assembly, and during or after spliceosome formation, Y14, DEK, SRm160, and RNPS1 associate at the -20 to -24 region of the 5 exon and remain stably bound to mRNA without apparent preference for a particular RNA sequence (7, 8). This postsplicing complex tags mRNAs for nuclear export and surveillance during which mRNAs with truncated open reading frames are detected and subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Surveillance of mRNA is promoted by interaction with hUpf3, which joins the complex via interaction with RNPS1 (10) and Y14 (11). hUpf3 may become associated with mRNA at a late post-splicing stage. Coimmunoprecipitation studies have shown that hUpf3, ALY, and TAP are found within the same complex prior to mRNA export (11). Export is promoted by the recruitement of TAP, by either ALY and/or Y14, before mRNA export. After export to the cytoplasm, ALY and TAP are dissociated, and Y14 (8), Magoh (9), RNPS1, and hUpf3b (10) remain bound to the mRNA upstream from the exon-exon junction site.

FIGURE 1: Multiple sequence alignment of the RBD domain of mouse ALY/mREF1-I (1) and flanking sequences against the corresponding sequences of human (hs-Homo sapiens) ALY (76), mouse (mm-Mus musculus) REF1-II (2), mouse REF2-I (2), yeast (sc-Saccharomyces cereVisiae) YRA1 (77), Arabidopsis thaliana (at) DIP1 and DIP2 (71), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (sp) MLO3 (72), human Y14 (78), human U2B-RBD1 (63), human U1A-RBD1 (55-58) and RBD2 (59), Drosophila melanogaster (ds) SXL-RBD1 (60, 61) and RBD2 (61, 62), mouse PABP1-RBD1 and RBD2 (64), human HuD-RBD1 and RBD2 (70), human hnRNPA1-RBD1 (67-69) and RBD2 (68, 69), human nucleolin-RBD1 and RBD2 (65, 66), and human TAP-RBD. Secondary structural elements based on the ALY77-182 structure are denoted on the top of the alignment. Strands are in purple and helices in magenta. Black boxes denote the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 submotifs (cyan). The alignment was created from WU-Blast2 alignments and structured-based alignments for sequences with a structure. The residues are highlighted in green (aliphatic), yellow (Ala, Gly, Pro), and purple (aromatic). Charged side chains are denoted in blue (positive) and red (negative).

Y14 binds preferentially to spliced mRNAs and is stably bound to sequences immediately upstream of exon-exon junctions. It appears to provide a position-specific molecular memory that communicates to the cytoplasm the location of exon and intron boundaries. Y14 co-immunoprecipitates with ALY from the nucleus. This complex is resistant to RNase A treatment, suggesting that Y14 and ALY bind to each other through protein-protein interactions instead of through tertiary interactions with mRNA (12). Recent studies have shown that ALY interacts with the conserved DEAD-box helicase UAP56, which functions during spliceosome assembly. It is has been suggested that UAP56 recruits ALY to the spliced mRNA-protein complex coupling splicing and export (13). ALY and UAP56 associate with proteins that form part of a transcription/export complex (TREX), which is recruited to activate genes during transcription and travels the entire length of the gene with RNA polymerase II during transcriptional elongation. The TREX complex appears to have a conserved role in coupling transcription to mRNA export (14). Although ALY is clearly important for mRNA splicing and export and also for enhancing transcription activation by several nuclear factors, the details of its function are not well understood. The available evidence suggests that ALY forms an interface for protein-protein interactions and also binds mRNA. As a step toward understanding the function of ALY at the molecular level, we have determined the threedimensional structure of residues Ser77 to Ser182 of mouse ALY (ALY77-182) encompassing an RBD (RNA binding domain), also known as RNA recognition motif (RRM), or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) domain homology region (Figure 1). The three-dimensional structure provides insights into the potential sites of interaction of ALY and allows us to make some predictions regarding the nature of its specific interactions with either proteins or ribonucleic acids.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Protein Samples. The RBD homology region (residues 77-182) of mouse ALY was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET21a(+) (Novagen, Wisconsin). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the vector, as well as the pUBS520 vector containing the dnaY gene (tRNAArgAGA/AGG), at 37 °C in minimal media. Cells were induced with 1 mM isopropyl1-thio- -D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) between 0.7 and 0.8 OD600, incubated at 25 °C and harvested after 11-12 h when they reached OD600 ) 2. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt), 1% NP-40 (nonaethylene glycol octyphenyl ether), and 100 mM DTT (dithiothreitol). The cells were lysed after sonication at 4 °C and centrifuged, and the supernatant containing ALY77-182 was passed through a 5 mL Hi-Trap Q column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 10 mM MES buffer, pH 6. The flow through was purified by FPLC using 5 mL Hi-Trap SP columns (Pharmacia), and the target protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient. The eluted fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep-3 (Amicon) and loaded onto a Superdex-75 column (Pharmacia). The purity of the isolated protein was determined by Coomassie gradient SDS-PAGE (Novex, Invitrogen), analytical reversedphase HPLC, and electrospray mass spectroscopy. Pure fractions were concentrated to 0.5 mM and exchanged into the NMR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl-d8, pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.01%NaN3 and 10% D2O) in a Centriprep-3 concentrator (Amicon, Inc.). ALY was uniformly labeled with 15N and/or 13C by growing cells in minimal medium with (15NH4)2SO4 or 15NH4Cl and/or 13C6glucose as sole sources of nitrogen and carbon.

7350 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 24, 2003 NMR Spectroscopy. All NMR spectra were recorded at 23 and 16 °C on Bruker AMX-I and -II 500 MHz, DRX 600 and 800 MHz spectrometers. Data were processed using NMRPipe and NMRDraw (15) and analyzed using NMRVIEW (16). Backbone resonances of ALY were assigned sequence-specifically from 3D HNCA (17), HN(CA)CB (18), CBCA(CO)NH (19), and HN(CO) (20) data. Side chain assignments were determined from 3D C(CO)NH-TOCSY (21), HC(CO)NH-TOCSY (21), 15N-edited TOCSY (22), HCCH-COSY (23), CCH-COSY (24), HCCH-TOCSY (23), 2D-13C-HMQC, DQF-COSY (25), and 1H-1H-TOCSY (26) spectra. The results from the 15N-NOESY-HSQC (22), 13CNOESY-HSQC (27), 15N/13C-NOESY-HSQC (28), and 13CHMQC-NOESY (29) spectra allowed determination of the topology of ALY77-182. Secondary structural elements and topology were determined from a combination of HR, CR, C , and C secondary chemical shift analysis and identification of unambiguous NOEs. Secondary chemical shifts were calculated using published random coil values for HR, CR, C , and C nuclei (30). 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances were externally referenced relative to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane5-sulfonate (DSS) (0 ppm) using the ratios 0.251 449 530 and 0.101 329 188 for 13C and 15N, respectively (31). Appropriate corrections to the random coil shifts were made for residues preceding a proline residue (32). Heteronuclear {1H}-15N steady-state NOE experiments (33) were recorded with a recycle delay of 6 s for the reference spectrum, while for the spectrum recorded with presaturation, a 3 s recycle delay followed by a 3 s period of 1H saturation was employed. Distance Restraints. Interproton distance restraints were determined from cross-peak intensities. Distance restraints of 2.7, 3.3, 5.0, 6.0, and 6.5 Å were employed for crosspeaks of strong, medium, medium-weak, weak, and very weak intensity, respectively, in the shared time 3D 15N/13CNOESY-HSQC (28), 15N-NOESY-HSQC (22), 2D homonuclear NOESY (34), and 13C-HMQC-NOESY (29) spectra. An additional 0.5 Å was added to the bounds for NOEs involving methyl protons (35), and standard pseudoatom corrections for aromatic protons and for residues with degenerate geminal methylene proton resonances were applied. Hydrogen bond restraints were derived for residues in the sheet from a combination of NOE and amide proton exchange data. Torsion Angle Restraints. Torsion angle restraints were determined on the basis of 3JHNHR coupling constants from the HNHA (36, 37) spectrum. Backbone  dihedral angle restraints were applied to 58 residues. Residues with 3JHN,HR < 4.0 Hz were constrained to -120° <  < -20°, and residues with 3JHN,HR > 8.0 Hz were restrained to -170° <  < -70° in both DYANA and AMBER structure calculations. In addition, / dihedral angle restraints were added for residues identified as occupying R or regions of the Ramachandran plot based on their CR, C , HR, and C chemical shifts. Residues identified in the R region were restrained to -120° <  < -20° and -80° <  < 20°, and residues defined in the region were restrained to -170° <  < -70° and 60° <  < 180°. Nonglycine residues without experimentally determined  restraints were restrained to negative  angles, unless secondary C shifts suggested the possibility of a positive  angle.

Perez-Alvarado et al. ´ Stereospecific assignments of C H2 resonances were made by qualitative assessment of 3JHR,H and 3JN,H couplings, with confirmation from inter and intraresidue NOEs. Stereospecific C H2 assignments were made for 21 of the Asp, Asn, Gln, His, Leu, Ser, Tyr, and Phe residues, and 1 angles were determined from analysis of the HNHB (38), DQFCOSY (25), and HACAHB-COSY (39) spectra and restrained to one of the three staggered rotameric conformations 1) -60 ((40)°, 60 ((40)°, or 180 ((40)°. Stereospecific assignments for 4 Val -methyl and 4 Leu -methyl groups which were not obscured by overlap were determined from the NOESY data. The  angles of the peptide backbone were constrained to 180 ((10)° for all residues in the AMBER calculations. Stereospecific assignments for several of Val residues were obtained by a combination of NOESY data and 13C-{13CO} (40) and 13C-{15N} (41) spin-echo difference CT-HSQC spectra. Structure Calculations. Structures were generated from random atom coordinates using DYANA (42) and were further refined with steps of torsion angle dynamics and energy minimization using AMBER 6 and 7 (43). An initial 1700 randomized starting structures were generated. A total of 701 experimental restraints were used for the initial DYANA calculations. The structures were refined with 4000 steps of torsion angle dynamics, ending with 1000 steps of energy minimization in DYANA. Of the 1700 structures, 656 structures with target functions less than 0.2 kcal/mol were selected for further refinement in a vacuum using AMBER 6.0 (43). Structures were refined using a total of 1141 unambiguous interproton distance restraints. The net charges on the charged side chains and the N and C termini were reduced to 20% of their normal value. Structures were subjected to 2000 steps of energy minimization followed by four cycles of vacuum simulated annealing from 1000 to 6 K, 20 ps each, followed by a final 2000 steps of energy minimization. The vacuum simulated annealing involved an initial heating of the structures to 1000 K over 2 ps, followed by 4 ps of molecular dynamics calculations, and a final simulated annealing protocol where the temperature was reduced to 6 K during 12 ps. The temperature was lowered with  held constant at 2.0 for 5 ps, then at 1.0 for 5 ps, 0.5 for 2 ps, and finally at 0.05 for the remaining 2 ps. Each round was of a duration of 20 ps, consisting of 20 000 steps of 1 fs each. Experimentally determined distance and torsion angle restraints were applied with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-1 and 150 kcal mol-1 rad-2, respectively. The force constant associated with the chirality restraints ( dihedral angles) was 150 kcal mol-1 rad-2. The experimental restraints were introduced into the calculations progressively, to ensure maximum sampling of conformational space, by increasing their weighting from an initial value of 0.1 to 1.0 (normal level) over the first 14 ps of the AMBER calculations. The 200 structures with the lowest restraint and AMBER energies were subjected to further AMBER refinement cycles. Finally, a family of 92 structures, selected on the basis of restraint violation energies and AMBER energies, was refined in AMBER 7 using the generalized Born (GB) continuum solvent model (44, 45). The AMBER 7 calculations involved an initial heating of the structures to 1000 K over 4 ps, followed by 4 ps of molecular dynamics calculations, and a final simulated annealing protocol where the temperature was reduced to 0 K during 12 ps.

experimental restraints were introduced into the calculations progressively by increasing their weighting from an initial value of 0.0-1.0 over the first 12 ps of the calculations. A final family of 32 structures was selected on the basis of low restraint and AMBER energies. The quality of these structures was determined using PROCHECK-NMR (46) and PROMOTIF-NMR (47). Coordinates and Assignments. Resonance assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number 5764). The coordinates for the 32 structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1NO8). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION NMR Resonance Assignments of ALY77-182. The boundaries for the ALY77-182 construct were determined from previous domain mapping experiments (1), secondary structure prediction, and analysis of the expression and solubility of different constructs with N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. A construct composed of residues 77-182 of mouse ALY (ALY77-182) exhibited the most favorable solution properties. ALY77-182 was soluble to 0.5 mM under high salt conditions (100 mM NaCl). 1H-15N-correlated NMR spectrum of ALY77-182 exhibits signals characteristic of a folded protein plus sharp overlapped resonances indicative of flexible regions (Figure 2). Extensive backbone resonance assignments (93% of residues) were made using sequential connectivities observed in the 15N edited NOESY and triple resonance data (48, 49). The backbone amide proton resonances of residues Arg78 and His137 were missing or broadened due to amide proton exchange. Although chemical shift dispersion of the majority of the backbone HN protons is good, overlap was observed

for many of the loop regions as well as the N-terminal flexible region. Data were collected at two temperatures, 23and 16 °C, and two pHs, 5.9 and 6.5, to assign resonances that were in the NMR intermediate time scale, were degenerate or in rapid exchange with the solvent. Side chain assignments were made using triple resonance spectra. Most of the aromatic ring protons were identified and assigned from the double-quantum filtered COSY spectrum. Elements of secondary structure were identified on the basis of the secondary chemical shifts of the HR, CR, C , and C nuclei (Figure 3) (30). This information combined with NOESY data allowed the structure of the central sheet to be defined (Figure 4).

Tertiary Structure Determination. A total of 1141 experimental restraints were used for structure calculations (Table 1). Hydrogen bonds were included for slowly exchanging amides in stretches of regular secondary structure ( sheet only) where hydrogen-bond acceptors were unambiguous. Of the structures calculated, 32 were picked which had converged to the lowest energies. The final family of 32 structures had no NOE violations greater than 0.12 Å and no dihedral angle violations greater than 2.5°. A superposition of the 32 structures is shown in Figure 5a. The backbone atoms involved in secondary structural elements are well defined in this family, with low RMSD from the mean structure.

These figures were generated in MOLMOL (79).

The structures were generated from random atom coordinates using DYANA (42) and refined with DYANA and the program AMBER 6.0 in a vacuum (43). Structures were selected based on the lowest restraint and AMBER energies and submitted to several molecular dynamics cycles using a generalized Born continuum solvent model. The use of GB potentials has been shown to improve the accuracy of

calculated solution structures, giving similar results to explicit solvent calculations (50). The restraint and angle violations for the final family of structures improved after using the generalized Born protocol. Structures from refinement in a vacuum had a mean restraint violation energy of 4.0 kcal/ mol, whereas the structures after calculations with the GB potential had a mean restraint violation energy of 0.93 kcal/ mol. Even more dramatic was the improvement in the quality of structures assessed by PROCHECK-NMR (46) (Table 2). Statistics for residues in the  and  regions for residues Gly105-Ser182 in the Ramachandran plot improved from 72.7% to 88.6% in the most favored regions (Table 1). RMSDs for different regions of the structures improved significantly (Table 2). Tertiary Structure of ALY77-182. The structure of the conserved RBD domain in ALY consists of four strands 1(Gly105-Ser110), 2(Leu131-Val136), 3(Thr147Phe152), and 4(Asn176-Leu179) forming an antiparallel sheet. Two alpha helices R1(Ser117-Phe128) and R2(Arg154-Tyr165), almost perpendicular to each other, pack against one face of the sheet (Figure 5b), making hydrophobic contacts via the side chains facing inward into the sheet. The exposed face of the sheet (Figure 6a) presents to the solvent hydrophobic and charged side chains that are potential binding sites for interaction with RNA and other proteins (Figure 6b,c). Two long loops facing the same side of the main fold, L3(His137-Gly146) and L5(Asn166-Met175), have different relaxation properties. The resonances of residues in loop L3 are extremely broad, whereas those of residues in loop L5 are sharp. Due to the broadness of the resonances, the conformation of loop L3 could not be determined unambiguously. The {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs for residues in loop L3 and L5 indicated that those loops are not fully flexible (Figure 7). Loop L5 consists of 10 residues that form a small antiparallel sheet between Gly167-Leu170 ( I) and Arg173-Met175 ( II). Residues Asp171 and Gly172 form a type I turn (51, 52). Residues Gly167, Val168, and Met175 form a G1G type bulge (53). The N-terminal tail consisting of residues Ser77 to Gly104 is highly disordered, as deduced from the secondary chemical shifts, the lack of medium-range and long-range NOEs and the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs (Figures 3 and 7). Nevertheless, residues Asp84 to Phe95 exhibit some restriction of motion, as indicated by {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs in the range of 0.1-0.2. Secondary chemical shifts from Ser93 to Gly100 are consistent with sampling in the helical region of , space (Figure 3).

Comparison with Other RBD Structures. Proteins that contain RBD domains can have single or multiple RBDs with

7354 Biochemistry, Vol. 42, No. 24, 2003

Perez-Alvarado et al. ´ In known RBD structures, helices R1 and R2 are of similar length, but the interhelix crossing angles vary from 90° to 120°. The helices in the RBD2 of Sxl (93°), hnRNP C (90°) (54), hnRNP A1 RBD1 and RBD2 (97°, 94°), and nucleolin RBD2 (98°) are almost perpendicular with respect to each other. In the case of ALY77-182, the helices R1 and R2 have a crossing angle of 111 degrees, similar to that of the RNA binding RBDs of U1A (106°) and nucleolin (111°). It is interesting to note that the RBDs in Sxl and U1A that do not apparently participate in RNA interactions have larger crossing angles (120° and 119°, respectively). Loop L5, which connects the second helix, R2, and the C-terminal strand, 4, exhibits low conservation among RBDs (Figure 1). This loop in U2B RBD1 (63), hnRNP A1 RBD2 (69), U1A RBD1, and Sxl RBD2 (61) makes few contacts with nucleic acids. Loop L5 in ALY contains close sequence and length similarities to loop L5 in U2B RBD1, U1A RBD1, PAB1 RBD2, and nucleolin RBD1 and RBD2. Gly167, Pro169, Pro174, and Met175 in ALY are identical in U2B RBD1 and U1A RBD1 (Figure 1). Also, residues Val168 and Leu170 are conserved hydrophobic in ALY, and a conserved positively charged residue that makes contacts with RNA in U1A RBD1 and U2B RBD1 is at the conserved position of Arg173. Even though ALY77-182 is similar in fold to other RBDs from other proteins, the surface residues of ALY RBD are different from those conserved in other RBDs. These differences confer specificity in molecular recognition and may explain why ALY has different predilections for interactions. The backbone resonances of the residues within the RNP2 ( 1) and RNP1 ( 3) submotifs in ALY77-182 that are exposed to the surface (Asp149, His151, Leu108, Ser110), at positions that are involved in RNA interactions in other RBDs, are extremely broad, suggesting residual mobility at the backbone level. Line broadening propagates to residues within the submotifs whose side chains form part of the hydrophobic core (Ala148, Val150, and Leu107). Implications for the Function of ALY. The main region in ALY77-182 that could facilitate RNA interactions is composed of the exposed face of the sheet and loop L3. The opposite face exposes side chains in loop L5 that could modulate hydrophobic interactions with another molecular surface. It should also be noted that the N-terminal region of ALY77-182 which corresponds to residues 77-104 is flexible and without regular structure. This N-terminal "tail" contains several aliphatic and aromatic side chains that could also modulate interactions. ALY77-182 possesses the conserved RNP1 and RNP2 submotifs that are characteristic of RBDs. However, a highly conserved Phe/Tyr in the middle of the RNP1 submotif, which participates in base stacking interactions in known RBD:RNA complexes, is replaced by an aspartate (Asp149) in ALY. The absence of Phe/Tyr at this position appears unique to ALY and its homologues and must account for their unique functions. This highly conserved aromatic residue is substituted by polar residues in a subset of RBD sequences. The Arabidopsis DIP1 and DIP2 proteins, which have Glu at this position, interact with the DNA binding domain of plant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (71). MLO3 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Thr substitution) appears to play a role in chromosome segregation in mitosis (72). YRA1 (Asn substitution) is required for mRNA export in

different types of recognition. In the case of ALY, the folding topology for residues Gly105 to Val180 is similar to that in the structures of other well characterized RBDs that bind RNA (Figure 5a,b) (54-70). Strands 1 and 3 in ALY77-182 contain the conserved RNP2 and RNP1 submotifs, respectively, indicated in Figure 1. A particular characteristic of the RNP submotifs in the sheet is partially conserved Phe/Tyr and well-conserved Phe/ Tyr residues at positions equivalent to Leu108 and Asp149 in ALY, respectively (Figure 1). In snRNP U1A RBD1 and U2B RBD1, these aromatic residues make contacts with RNA and with each other. The absence of the highly conserved Phe/Tyr in the ALY RNP1 submotif is characteristic of ALY and its homologues and may indicate a unique mechanism of RNA binding by the RBD in ALY like proteins. bulges within the sheet have been found to contribute to the specificity of protein and RNA recognition. bulges have been observed, for example, in strands 1 and 4 in hnRNP C (54), 2 of Sxl RBD2 (62), and snRNP U1A RBD1 (55) but are not present in hnRNP A1 (67-69). In ALY, a classic bulge is formed by Lys132 and Lys133 instead of bulky hydrophobic and acidic residues as in the case of other RBDs such as Sxl RBD2 and snRNP U1A RBD1 (Figure 1). The presence of two positively charged side chains at these positions is characteristic among close homologues of ALY such as DIP1, DIP2, the ALY yeast homologue-YRA1, and the yeast protein MLO3 (Figure 1), which have unique functions. Residues in the loop L3 and on the surface of the sheet are poorly conserved among RBDs of known structure (Figure 1). ALY77-182 contains nine residues between 2 and 3, compared to five residues in U1A RBD2, six residues in nucleolin RBD2, seven residues in U1A RBD1 and U2B RBD1, eight residues in PABP RBD2 and nucleolin RBD1, 10 residues in hnRNP A1 RBD1 and RBD2, Sxl RBD1 and RBD2, HUD RBD1 and RBD2, and PABP RBD1, and a two-residue -hairpin in hnRNP C1. Amide proton resonance signals for residues in this loop are extremely broad for ALY77-182.

Structure Determination of the Nuclear Factor ALY yeast, interacts with poly(A)+ RNA, has in vitro RNA-RNA annealing activity, and binds to Mex67p which associates in vivo with nuclear pores and poly(A)+ RNA (4). ALY has been determined to bind to the mRNA export factor TAP (2). This interaction is conserved in the ALY yeast homologue YRA1, which interacts with the TAP yeast homologue Mex67p (4). The structure of the minimal region of TAP required for interaction with ALY contains two domains: a noncanonical RBD and a conserved leucine rich region (LRR) domain similar to that of U2A (73). U2A interacts with the U2B RBD1, which binds to U2 snRNA only in the presence of U2A (63). In the case of TAP, it interacts on its own with the cis-acting constitutive transport element (CTE) of simian type D retroviruses (74), suggesting that the LRR and RBD regions of TAP might come into contact to bind to the CTE in a manner similar to the U2BU2A-U2 snRNA interactions (73). Since the presence of ALY is required for TAP binding to cellular mRNAs and considering that the RBD in ALY has more structural and sequence similarities to U2B than the non canonical RBD of TAP, it is possible that association of ALY with the LRR of TAP is necessary for interaction with cellular mRNAs. On the other hand, on the basis of the mode of RNA interaction by other RBDs such as RBD1 and RBD2 of the polyA binding protein 1 (64), RBD1 and RBD2 of Sex Lethal (61, 62), RBD1 and RBD2 of HuD (70), and RBD1 and RBD2 of nucleolin (65), it is also possible that the concerted interactions of ALY and the noncanonical RBD of TAP are necessary for complex formation. The regions of ALY responsible for interaction with TAP and mRNA were previously determined as the variable regions flanking the RBD domain in ALY (75). The variable N and C terminal regions in ALY, however, exhibit low sequence conservation and are composed of repeats of positively charged residues that could lead to nonspecific interactions with TAP and mRNA. It is also possible that the RBD domain of ALY is directly involved in the interaction with TAP. Low-affinity interactions between the RBD of ALY and TAP were observed in yeast two hybrid experiments (M. AndersenLandes, unpublished results, 2002). The interaction may be strengthened in the ternary complex. The N-terminal helix in ALY77-182 (R1) exposes negatively charged side chains consisting of D118, D120, E123, and E127 (Figure 6c). Clusters of negatively charged residues at the R1 position seem common among other RBDs (Figure 1). Interestingly, DIP1 and DIP2 contain a putative modification domain at the same position. It has been suggested that this cluster of Glu residues in DIP1 and DIP2 might undergo poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation by the plant homologue of the Znfinger poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) modulating their interaction (71). ALY has been found to interact with DNA binding transcription factors as well as RNA binding proteins. These interactions could be modulated via the exposed negative surface of R1 in the RBD in ALY and the nucleic acid binding surfaces of the DNA and RNA binding proteins that have been found to interact with ALY. One of these interactions is the interaction of ALY with the DEADbox helicase UAP56. Studies have shown that UAP56 couples ALY with transcription as well as mRNA export (13, 14). In summary, ALY is an important factor for mRNA export and also for enhancing transcriptional activation by some

The three-dimensional structure of ALY77182 and its comparison with RBD proteins of known structure provides insights into the differences in ALY that could account for its unique function. Comparisons to its homologues and other RBD proteins with close sequence homology has allowed us to make predictions regarding its mechanism of interaction based on its three-dimensional structure.
