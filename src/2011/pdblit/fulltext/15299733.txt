Abstract

A loop-deleted mutant form of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase from Thermus thermophilus was constructed to investigate the relationship between the flexibility of the structure and the thermostability of the enzyme. The structure of the mutant enzyme was determined by X-ray crystallography and was found to be almost the same as that of the native enzyme with a reduced temperature factor. Although the mutant protein had lost the flexible loop, its function and thermostability had remained unchanged. This phenomenon can be explained by an internal reprieve tolerance mechanism.
1. I n t r o d u c t i o n

During evolution, the primary structure of a given enzyme may have varied to allow the enzyme to exhibit high catalytic activity in response to changes in the environment, such as changes in optimal temperature, pH, ionic strength. Various proteins from thermophiles are thought to have acquired their characteristic resistance to high temperature as one example of such protein engineering in nature (Oshima, 1990). During the evolutionary process amino-acid residues must be replaced step by step; more dramatic changes would cause the immediate disappearance of an enzyme's specific function. In particular, a 'soft' structure, such as a loop region is easily mutated to allow a change in the character of an enzyme. 3-lsopropylmalate dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.85; IPMDH) is an enzyme in the leucine biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the dehydrogenation and decarboxylation in the conversion of 3-isopropylmalate (IPM) to 2-oxoisocaproate, with the accompanying reduction of NAD + (Yamada et al., 1990). Several genes for IPMDH's have been cloned from eubacteria (Sekiguchi, Suda, lshii, Nosoh & Tsuda, 1987; Imai, Sekiguchi, Nosoh & Tsuda, 1987; Kawaguchi, Inagaki, Kuwata & Tano, 1993), extreme thermophiles (Kagawa et al., 1984; Kirino & Oshima, 1991; Kirino, Aoki, Aoshima, Hayashi f Present address: National Institute of Bioscience and Human Technology, 1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba 305, Japan. © 1996 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Great Britain - all rights reserved

& Oshima, 1994), and eukaryotes (Sekiguchi et al., 1986). The three-dimensional structure of IPMDH from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8 was determined at 2.2A resolution (Imada, Sato, Tanaka, Katsube & Oshima, 1991). The enzyme is composed of two isomorphic subunits that are associated with each other by hydrophobic interactions between four a-helices (Fig. la). Each subunit is separated into the two domains, designated the subunit-subunit interface domain and distal domain (Fig. lb; Kirino et al., 1994). The analysis of IPMDH revealed the presence of some flexible regions with high temperature factors or poor electron-density distribution. A loop region from residues Phe75 to I1e84, located near the d a-helix, had a higher temperature factor than other regions, which suggested that this loop might be very mobile and might play an important role in heat stability. This loop is used to locate the d a-helix at the putative binding site of the substrate, as deduced from a comparison of primary and tertiary structures with isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) (Eguchi, Wakagi & Oshima, 1988; Thorsness & Koshland, 1987; Dean, Lee & Koshland, 1989; Laporte & Koshland, 1983; Hurley et al., 1989; Hurley, Dean, Thorsness, Koshland & Stroud, 1990; Hurley, Dean, Sohl, Koshland & Stroud, 1990; Hurley, Dean, Koshland & Stroud, 1991) (Fig. 2). The various observations imply that the deletion of two residues in this loop has a critical effect upon the choice of substrate by each enzyme. A loop-deleted variant of IPMDH from T. thermophilus was constructed to examine the importance of the flexible loop. While only two amino acids (Arg82 and Lys83), were deleted from the loop upstream of the d ahelix (Pro86 through Lys95), 11 amino acids (Asp79 through Thr88) were replaced by the corresponding nine amino acids (Gly83 through Gin91) from yeast IPMDH in order to prevent a dramatic conformational change near the deleted residues (Fig. 2). In spite of the deletion, the mutant protein was found to have catalytic activity. In the present report we describe the structure of the loopdeleted IPMDH as determined at 2.2,& resolution by Xray crystallography. A comparison of the structure with that of the wild-type enzyme explains the importance of the flexible loop in the thermostability of the enzyme.

125

The loop-deleted IPMDH was constructed by sitedirected mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985) using the oligonucleotide 5'-GGA AAG AAG CCC CTG CTC CGGGCG GAC GGA TCC CGT GCC CCA CTT GGG CCC-3'. The mutant gene was expressed in E. coli JA221 as described elsewhere (Yamada et al., 1990). The enzyme was purified by the previously described method with minor modifications (Miyazaki, Eguchi, Yamagishi, Wakagi & Oshima, 1992; Miyazaki & Oshima, 1993). About 4 0 m g of enzyme were isolated from 3 0 g wet weight of cells. 2.2. Crystallization In order to compare the structure of the mutant enzyme with that of the wild-type enzyme under the same

conditions, 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.6 was used as the crystallization buffer. The solution in which the enzyme was dissolved was replaced by the phosphate buffer by the dialysis method. The concentration of the protein was adjusted to 10 mg ml -~ for crystallization by ultrafiltration with a YM-10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA, USA). The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed for crystallization (Onodera et al., 1994; Sakurai et al., 1992). Droplets were made on the cover glass by mixing 5 Ill of the solution of protein and 5 ~tl of reservoir solution, which contained ammonium sulfate of various concentrations from 0.9 to 1.4M. Droplets were equilibrated against the corresponding reservoir solutions at 298 K. Crystals were grown for about 2 weeks, and the typical dimensions of the resultant crystals were 0.5 x 0.5 × 1.0 mm. 2.3. X-ray diffractometry Three-dimensional X-ray diffraction data were collected on an R-AXIS IIc system (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan), on the assumption that the cell dimensions of the present crystals were the same as most of the intact crystals of the wild type. The morphology of the crystals of the mutant protein closely resembled that of the wild type. Before the collection of all reflections, several still photographs were successfully processed. They were used to provide refined cell parameters and the orientation of the lattice by application of the P R O C E S S program (Rigaku). The crystals belonged to the P3221 space group, with cell dimensions of a - b - 78.45, and c - 158.07,~. These values deviated from those of the wild type by less than 0.2%. The protocol and results of data collection are summarized in Table 1. The merging and scaling of the data were performed by the method of Fox & Holmes (1966). The data up to 1.9A resolution were collected with a n Rmerg e of 3.79% in the present study.

2.4. Determination of the structure and refinement Since the present enzyme was isomorphous with the wild-type enzyme, the structure of the mutant enzyme was determined directly from [2Fo(mutant) - F c ( w i l d type)](pc and [Fo(mutant)- Fc(wild type)]qgc difference electron-density maps, calculated by X-PLOR (Brtinger, Karplus & Petsko, 1989; Brtinger, Karplus & Erickson, 1990). An initial model was built by replacing the 11 amino acids of the wild-type enzyme by alanine residues and removing all solvent molecules found on the molecular surface. After the model had been refined by X-PLOR to an R factor of 0.21, the 11 residues were replaced by the correct residues by inspecting the [2Fo - F c] map with the FRODO program (Jones, 1978). Successive refinements reduced the R factor to 0.17 between 5.0 and 2.2~, resolution (Table 2). The final structure was evaluated by construction of a Ramachandran plot (Ramachandran & Sassiekharan, 1968) and a Luzzati plot (Luzzati, 1952).

The structure of the loop-deleted mutant was successfully determined at 2.2A resolution. The quality of the collected intensity data was better than that of the intact IPMDH, that is, the Rmerge w a s 3.8% for the entire data set. The improved stabilization of the crystal was attributed to the deletion of the loop. The R factor after refinement by X-PLOR was reduced to 0.17 within 2.2 resolution and the r.m.s, deviations of the bond distances and angles were 0.2 ,~ and 0.2 °, respectively. The Luzzati plot indicated that the overall error of the atomic positions was 0.25 ~, within 2.2 ,~, resolution. Amino-acid residues from Glu78 to Leu88 were clearly identified on the electron-density map, as shown in Fig. 3(a). A short section of the loop was observed upstream of the d o~-helix.

differed from that of the wild type as a result of the deletion of two residues and the replacement of five residues, the chain folding of the peptide bonds remained unaltered compared with the wild type, as shown in Figs. l(b) and 3(b). Apart from the replaced residues, the rootmean-square deviation of the C a atom was 0.01 ,~, from the wild-type molecule. The positions of residual atoms were also unchanged, with deviations within 0.3~,. The Ramachandran plot indicated that most of the torsion angles had normal values and, as found in the wild-type enzyme, glycine residues and several other residues including Arg176, Asp231 and I1e284 were located beyond the accepted regions. These outliers have hydrogen bonds between Nql of Arg176 and O51 of Asp231, between Nr/2 of Arg176 and O31 of Glu127, and between the backbone N atom of I1e284 and O y l of Tyr333. In the vicinity of the loop-deleted region, additional hydrogen bonds were found between Arg83 and Glu85 and between the backbone N atom of Arg83 and Gin86, in spite of the similarities in the folding of the chain. The former bond was generated as a result of rotation of the Co~--C/3 bond of Arg83 by 180 ° and may contribute to the lower mobility of Arg83, as judged by its lower temperature factor (Fig. 4). The latter bond may be a result of the difference in bulkiness caused by the replacement of Gin by Thr at the 86th position. The lengths of the hydrogen bonds are listed in Table 3. The residues from Vai72 to Lys76 appeared to adapt to the deletion by loss of folding of the chain since these residues in the mutant had higher temperature factors than those in the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). Kinetic constants of the wild-type and loop-deleted IPMDH for the substrate and NAD + are shown in Table

4. Although both the K m and kcat values for the substrate and NAD + increased in the mutated protein, the value of kcat/K m remained unchanged. This observation agrees well with the similarity between the two structures, and with the fact that the heat stability of the mutant protein, as measured by the standard method, was also the same as that of the wild type, as shown in Fig. 5. However, the complex of the enzyme and substrate seems less stable than that of the wild-type enzyme and substrate, since the increase in K m corresponds to an accelerated rate of dissociation of the enzyme and the substrate. Because the flexibility of the loop region had been restricted by the deletion of two amino acids, the optimal fit between the enzyme and substrate was destroyed. However, the mutant enzyme recognized isopropylmalate correctly and failed to interact with isocitrate. Thus, the enzyme was able to recognize the substrate correctly without the Arg82 and Lys83 residues. An internal reprieve mechanism can be invoked to explain the heat stability of IPMDH. It is postulated that an enzyme molecule can adopt an altered active form as a result of its flexibility. Hence, the enzyme can avoid complete loss of activity. In the case of loop-deleted IPMDH, the replacement of a loop region, as a unit, decreased the flexibility of the loop. However, as shown in Fig. 4, a new flexible region appeared, in which the temperature factor was higher. The region acts to relieve stress, because the high temperature factor is the sum of

the new constraints imposed by the new structure together with the establishment of hydrogen bonds. In chimeric IPMDH's, many amino-acid substitutions did not affect the original folding of the enzyme (Onodera et al., 1994). While protein engineering allows us to produce any variant of an enzyme at the primary sequence level, we have to develop strategies for generating an enzyme with a particular function. Even though the affinity of the loop-deleted IPMDH for IPM was reduced, the enzyme retained the ability to recognize the substrate correctly as well as, unexpectedly, its thermostability. The present study indicates that the full length of the flexible loop is not a prerequisite for activity. We had anticipated that the reduced flexibility of the loop might enhance the thermostability. However, we failed to detect any enhancement in the loop-deleted enzyme. More research is required to characterize the relationship between the structure of the enzyme and its function.
