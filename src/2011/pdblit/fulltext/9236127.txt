The crystal structure of superoxide dismutase (SOD) from the hyperÊ thermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus has been determined at 2.3 A resolution by molecular replacement and re®ned to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.8 % (Rfree 19.8 %). The crystals belong to the space group C2 Ê Ê Ê (a  76.3 A, b  124.3 A, c  60.3 A, b  128.8  ) with two identical monomers in the asymmetric unit. The monomer has a molecular weight of 24 kDa and consists of 210 amino acid residues of which 205 are visible in the electron density map. The overall fold of the monomer of S. solfataricus SOD is similar to that of the other known Fe or Mn-SODs. S. solfataricus SOD forms a very compact tetramer of a type similar to that of SOD from the hyperthermophile Aquifex pyrophilus. Both structures show an elevated number of inter-subunit ion-pairs compared with the mesophilic SOD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the thermophilic SOD from Thermus thermophilus. However, in contrast to the A. pyrophilus SOD structure, the number of intra-subunit ion-pairs as well as intersubunit hydrogen bonds is not higher than in the compared mesophilic and thermophilic SOD structures. The electron density also revealed an unexpected and unusual covalent modi®cation of a conserved tyrosine in the active site. Its involvement in the speci®c activity of the enzyme is discussed.

Introduction
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme for the protection of aerobic organisms against toxic radicals produced during oxidative processes (Keele et al., 1970; McCord et al., 1977; Fridovich, 1989). Since SOD has been discovered in the anaerobic bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (Hatchikian & Henry, 1977), Propionibacterium sherAbbreviations used: SOD, superoxide dismutase; SsSOD, Sulfolobus solfataricus SOD; ES-MS, electrospraymass spectroscopy; PDB, Protein Data Bank; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; The sequence numbering refers to the SsSOD numbering if not specially noted, and the numbering of the secondary structure elements are sequential for S. solfataricus (Figure 6).

manii (Meier et al., 1982) and Bacteriodes fragilis (Gregory & Dapper, 1983), as well as in primitive protozoa lacking mitochondria, such as Entamoeba histolytica (Tannich et al., 1991), it is likely that other functions could be assigned to SOD, probably linked to the presence of metal ions, such as Mn, Fe or Cu/Zn; recently, a Ni-SOD has been described (Kim et al., 1996). SODs are generally divided into two families based on sequence and structural homology: Cu/Zn-SOD and Fe-MnSOD, where enzymes of the latter family have either iron or manganese bound in the active site. To date, the structures of eight different Cu/ZnSODs and nine Mn or Fe-SODs have been solved (Table 1). Even though the three-dimensional structure of Cu/Zn-SOD appears different from that of Mn or Fe-SOD, it cannot be excluded that SOD could have evolved from an ancestral form, functioning in the cell as a metal carrier. Therefore, the study of the structural properties of SOD from

Sulfolobus solfataricus Fe-SOD Crystal Structure

The metal indicated is the active site metal. P. shermanii SOD has been shown to be active with Fe or Mn and both structures have been solved. The oligomerisation is as indicated in SWISS-PROT, except for A. pyrophilus SOD which has no entry in SWISSPROT (oligomerisation reported by Lim et al. (1997a)), and for SsSOD which is concluded to be a tetramer (see the text). Some of the structures have been solved in different oxidation states or in complex with an inhibitor (azide). The structures of some mutants are also solved.

primitive organisms could provide clues to the understanding of structure-function relationships in this enzyme. Moreover, SODs from organisms adapted to extreme growth conditions represent suitable models of proteins adapted to extreme environments. The functional and structural aspects of SOD have been extensively reviewed (Fridovich, 1989; Touati, 1988; Bannister et al., 1987; Stallings et al., 1991). Fe and Mn-SOD catalyse the dismutation of superoxide in a two-step reaction (Bull & Fee, 1985): OÁÀ  M3 À SOD 3 O2  M2 À SOD 2 1

OÁÀ  M2 À SOD  2H 3 H2 O2  M3 À SOD 2 2 where M signi®es the active site metal. Fe and MnSOD are structurally similar with high degree of homology in the amino acid sequence. The molecular environment around the metal is highly conserved in different Fe and Mn-SOD structures, to the extent that what determines the metal speci®city is as yet unclear. Some SODs are functional only if bound to the original metal, even though they are able to bind either Mn or Fe (Ose & Fridovich, 1979). Vance & Miller (1998) proposed that the inactivity of metal-substituted SOD is due to inappropriate redox potentials in metal-substituted structures. There is also evidence of SODs functioning with either Mn or Fe (Gregory & Dapper, 1983; Meier et al., 1982, 1994). Vice versa, other Fe-SODs derived from Mn-SODs show very little activity at pH 8, while at pH 6 they display similar high activity with either Mn or Fe (Yamakura et al., 1995). In an attempt to elucidate the effects of metal replacement on the structure of the enzyme, Schmidt et al. (1996) solved the crystal structure of P. shermanii SOD, which works with either Fe or Mn bound in the active site. A com-

parison of the two structures did not reveal signi®cant changes in the metal binding environment. The structure of SOD from extremophiles is receiving increasing interest. Recently, the Fe-SOD from the hyperthermophile bacterium Aquifex pyrophilus has been isolated and characterised (Lim et al., 1997a) and its three-dimensional structure has been reported (Lim et al., 1997b). Compared with mesophilic SODs, a large number of ion-pairs and an increased buried surface area have been found; the contribution of both factors to the compactness of the tetrameric structure of A. pyrophilus SOD is probably involved in the thermostability of A. pyrophilus SOD. Another hyperthermophilic SOD has been isolated from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsSOD, optimum growth conditions: T  87  C, pH 3.5). SsSOD is endowed with a higher thermostability than A. pyrophilus SOD (Dello Russo et al., 1997); furthermore, compared with mesophilic and halophilic SODs, it contains a greater number of hydrophobic and bulky amino acid residues. In fact, the values of average hydrophobicity and amino acid mean weight of SsSOD are the highest among the thermophilic SODs known so far (Dello Russo et al., 1997); it is remarkable that these values increase with the increase in the optimal growth temperature of the organism (Dello Russo et al., 1997; De Vendittis & Bocchini, 1996). These ®ndings prompted us to crystallise SsSOD in order to improve our knowledge on the relationship between thermal adaptation and three-dimensional structure of proteins. Another interesting feature is the 38 % amino acid identity shared between SsSOD and the human mitochondrial SOD, which supports the hypothesis that the genome of Sulfolobus could represent the ancestor of the animal mitochondrial genome (Karlin & Campbell, 1994). We have crystallised and solved the threedimensional structure of SsSOD. The overall monomer fold is the same as that of other known Fe and Mn-SODs. However, different SODs have different

Sulfolobus solfataricus Fe-SOD Crystal Structure

191 Materials and Methods). The overall fold of the monomer of SsSOD is similar to the fold of other known Fe-Mn-SOD structures (Figure 1 and Table 1). The structure is divided into two domains connected by a loop (residues Pro93-Pro101). The N-terminal domain is mainly a-helical. The ®rst 13 amino acid residues constitute an extended region packed against, and antiparallel with helix a1 (see Figure 6 for the numbering of the secondary structure elements). The following ten residues, which include a conserved cis-proline (Pro23), form a region of turns preceding the ®rst helix, a1, which is antiparallel with a2. Helices a1 and a2 contribute one metal ligand each (His33 and His84). The relative positions of His33 and of the two conserved residues His37 and Tyr41 are affected by a conserved distortion in helix a1, caused by Gly36 (Stallings et al., 1985). The torsion angles of this glycine lie outside the a-helical core region of the Ramachandran plot (f  À103  , c  À71  ), which leads to the interruption of the standard a-helical hydrogen-bonding pattern. The a-helical hydrogen-bonding is interrupted also in a2. The carbonyl oxygen of Gly80 forms a conserved hydrogen bond to Nd1 of the metal ligand His84 instead of participating in the a-helical hydrogen bonding. The C-terminal domain is of the a  b type and consists of a three-stranded antiparallel b-sheet with helices a3, a4, a5 and a6 on one side, and a loop joining strands b2 and b3 on the other. Strand b3 and the loop following it, which has a

subunit interactions and form different oligomers. SsSOD forms a very compact tetramer of a type observed in other known SOD structures, including A. pyrophilus SOD. Similarly to A. pyrophilus SOD, SsSOD shows an elevated number of intersubunit ion-pairs compared with the mesophilic SOD from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Cooper et al., 1995) and thermophilic SOD from Thermus thermophilus (Stallings et al., 1985; Ludwig et al., 1991); in contrast to the A. pyrophilus structure, the number of intra-subunit ion-pairs and inter-subunit hydrogen bonds is not higher in SsSOD than in mesophilic and thermophilic SODs. An unexpected and unusual covalent modi®cation of a tyrosine in the active site was found; this ®nding is interesting since this residue is strictly conserved and it has been proposed to play an important role in the mechanism of the enzymatic reaction and in the active site conformation.

Results and Discussion
Overall structure The crystal structure of S. solfataricus superoxide dismutase (SsSOD), a 24 kDa iron-containing protein with 210 amino acid residues, was solved by Ê molecular replacement at 2.3 A resolution and re®ned to a crystallographic R-factor of 16.8 % Ê (Rfree 19.8 %) for all data (96 % complete to 2.3 A). The crystals belong to the space group C2 Ê Ê Ê (a  76.3 A, b  124.3 A, c  60.3 A, b  128.8  ) with two monomers in the asymmetric unit (see

Figure 1. The SsSOD monomer. The N-terminal domain is coloured red and the C-terminal domain green. The iron is shown as a purple sphere. This Figure and Figures 2, 3, 4 and 7 were prepared with MOLSCRIPT (Kraulis, 1991).

192 partial a-helical character, supply the other two metal ligands (Asp170 and His174). The relative position of the two domains is stabilised by ten hydrogen bonds, of which six are conserved in nearly all the other known SOD structures. There are also seven water molecules in the domain interface which are hydrogen-bonded to both domains or to one domain and to the interdomain loop. Two of these interactions are conserved in most of the structures. Furthermore, the metal contributes to the inter-domain interactions with two ligands from each domain. The connecting region between the domains (Pro93-Pro101) contains several glycine residues and is the most mobile part of the structure, as indicated by the average B-factors of the main-chain atoms (Figure 2). This region includes two lysine residues and one serine with unclear side-chain electron density. In the Ramachandran plot for SsSOD there are no non-glycine residues in disallowed regions (high-energy conformations). There are, however, two non-glycine residues per monomer which fall in the generously allowed regions (medium-energy conformations): Glu162 and Lys181. Both show clear electron density around the main-chain even though the side-chain of Lys181 is not clearly de®ned. The Oe1 atom of Glu162 in subunit A forms an ion-pair with Nz of Lys203 in subunit C. Glu162 is in most SOD structures conserved as a glycine and is found in the same region of the Ramachandran plot as in SsSOD, in or close to the region of left-handed a-helices (f  52  , c  À18  ). The X-ray structure has been determined of a glycine-to-alanine mutant in this position in M. tuberculosis SOD (Cooper et al., 1996). Even though the alanine is expected to have much smaller tendency to adopt such a conformation it was found in the same region of the Ramachandran plot, but the stability of the protein was

reduced. Lys181, which is next to the conserved Asn182, is a lysine in ®ve of the nine known SOD structures. The values of the torsion angles for this residue are also conserved in most of the structures (f  57  , c  À133  ). Crystal packing and oligomerisation The asymmetric unit of the crystal is formed by two protein monomers (A and B) related by a dyad axis (Figure 3). The dimers (A/B and C/D) are related by the crystallographic 2-fold axis and form a very compact tetramer (Figure 4). The packing of the tetramers in the crystal is indicated in Figure 5. As seen from this Figure the tetramer packs loosely with other tetramers, giving the appearance of the tetramer representing the normal oligomerisation state of the enzyme. A similar arrangement of the subunits in the tetramer was found in the SOD structures from M. tuberculosis (Cooper et al., 1995), A. pyrophilus (Lim et al., 1997b) and P. shermanii (Schmidt et al., 1996), which are assumed to be tetramers physiologically. This strongly suggests that SsSOD is also a tetramer in solution. In a previous investigation the Mr of SsSOD estimated on a HiLoad Superdex 75 gel ®ltration column was 52,000, which suggested that SsSOD under native conditions could be a homodimer (Dello Russo et al., 1997). Therefore, the determination of the Mr of SsSOD was repeated by using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column calibrated with molecular size markers made of mesophilic proteins; the resulting Mr was 65,400. On the other hand, if the same column was calibrated with puri®ed S. solfataricus proteins with known molecular size, the Mr of SsSOD was estimated as 87,900. This latter value approached the theoretical value of 96,000 calculated for the tetramer. The interactions between the A and B subunits are well conserved, which is not surprising since

Figure 3. Dimers: stereoviews of an A/B (a) and an A/C (b) dimer. The dimers are viewed along two different 2-fold axes of the local 222-point group symmetry of the tetramer. The axis relating the A and C subunits is also a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The subunit colours are: A (yellow), B (green) and C (blue). The iron atoms are shown as purple spheres.

this is the conserved functional dimer. There are two ion-pairs (formed by Arg72 and Glu153) and 11 hydrogen bonds between the subunits of which seven are conserved. Among these are two hydrogen bonds between the conserved residues Glu173 and His174 (one of the iron ligands) and one between the conserved residues His37 (Ne2) and Tyr177 (OH). In addition, seven water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to both subunits, but only one water-mediated interaction is conserved. The interactions of Glu173 and His174 from different subunits (Glu173 Oe1His174 N and Glu173 Oe2-His174 Nd1) closely couple the two active sites, although the enzyme is not known to exhibit co-operativity. There are also extensive interactions between the subunits belonging to the different dimers of the tetramer.

There are eight ion-pairs (formed by His81, Lys82, Asp141, Glu143, Glu162 and Lys203), 24 hydrogen bonds and six water molecules involved in interactions between subunits A and C. Between subunits A and D there are two ionpairs (formed by Arg51 and Asp66), eight hydrogen bonds and two water-mediated interactions. However, in the four structures of S. solfataricus, M. tuberculosis, A. pyrophilus and P. shermanii SODs, only four hydrogen bonds and two water-mediated interactions are conserved between the A and C subunits while none of the A and D subunit interactions are conserved. As a comparison, each tetramer forms 16 hydrogen bonds to other tetramers and four water molecules per tetramer are hydrogenbonded to other tetramers.

Comparison of SOD structures: oligomerisation differences Figure 6 shows a structural alignment of the amino acid sequences of Fe-Mn-SODs for which the three-dimensional structure is known. The high degree of sequence conservation is re¯ected in the high degree of conservation of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme from different organisms. SsSOD is most similar to M. tuberculosis Ê and P. shermanii SODs (rms difference 1.1 A for Ê 193 and 1.0 A for 191 Ca atoms, respectively). All the noticeable differences in the Ca trace are related to the oligomerisation except in the region Ala92Gly103 which includes the loop connecting the two domains. The extended N terminus shows a variable length. In S. solfataricus, A. pyrophilus, M. tuberculosis and P. shermanii SODs, the N terminus in subunit A interacts with the loop between b1 and b2 in subunit C. The N terminus is involved in intersubunit contacts also in human mitochondrial SOD. The most variable part is the region Glu50Gly73, including the loop between a1 and a2. This part is involved in dimer-dimer packing (for those that are tetramers). In SsSOD this loop is most similar to the corresponding loop in A. pyrophilus, M. tuberculosis, P. shermanii and human mitochon-

drial SODs, whereas in T. thermophilus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas ovalis and Bacillus stearothermophilus SODs, this loop has a different conformation. In SsSOD the residues in this loop in subunit A interact with the corresponding loop and with helix a1 from the D subunit, as well as with helix a4 from subunit C. Also for the two SOD structures which form tetramers of a different type than SsSOD, namely T. thermophilus and human mitochondrial SODs, the loop between a1 and a2 is involved in tetramer packing. The loop formed by His155-Pro164 between strands b2 and b3 in subunit A is packed symmetrically against the same loop in the C subunit (in the A/C interface) in SsSOD. In S. solfataricus, A. pyrophilus, M. tuberculosis and P. shermanii SODs Ê this loop superposes well (within 1.1 A rms deviation of the Ca atoms). In the other structures the loop packs against a helix situated in the variable loop part between a1 and a2, which is absent in SsSOD. Human mitochondrial SOD does not have this helix either, but nevertheless, the loop between b2 and b3 superposes on the loop of the group which does have the helix (T. thermophilus, E. coli, P. ovalis, B. stearothermophilus). In human mitochondrial SOD the ®rst part of a2 in a neighbouring subunit plays the role of the extra helix in T. thermophilus, E. coli, P. ovalis and B. stearothermo-

Figure 6. Amino acid sequence alignment of the known Fe-Mn-SOD structures based on structural superposition (see Materials and Methods). The SOD sequences are from S. solfataricus (Ss), M. tuberculosis (Mt), A. pyrophilus (Ap), E. coli (Ec), T. thermophilus (Tt), human mitochondrial (Hm), P. ovalis (Po), B. stearothermophilus (Bs) and P. shermanii (Ps). All the structures were pair-wise aligned with SsSOD by structural superposition. The complete sequence of SsSOD is shown, but the other sequences only include the residues which were found to superpose on residues in SsSOD. The N-terminal domain includes the ®rst two helices and is joined by the loop Pro93-Pro101 with the C-terminal domain which consists of the b-strands and the last four helices. The numbering refers to the S. solfataricus sequence. The a-helices are indicated with blue boxes and b-strands by red arrows. The ®rst text line shows the secondary structure assignment (see Materials and Methods): H, a-helix; h, extension of a-helix; E, b-strand; e, extension of b-strand; G, 310-helix; g, extension of 310-helix; B, residue in isolated b-bridge; S, bend; T, hydrogen-bonded turn; t, extension of hydrogen-bonded turn. The region between b3 and a5 is indicated to be a-helical, but only some hydrogen bonds are ful®lled in the short and distorted helical segment and therefore it is not shown as an helix here or in the structure diagrams. The metal ligands are coloured red. Those which are identical in all structures are coloured yellow and those which are identical in seven or eight of the nine structures are coloured blue. Furthermore, those residues which are identical and unique for either Fe-SOD or Mn-SOD are coloured green (P. shermanii is not conÊ sidered in this case but coloured if appropriate). Residues in SsSOD with at least one atom within 8 A of the iron are marked #. The sequences are as according to SWISS-PROT in the cases where the SWISS-PROT sequence is different from the sequence in the co-ordinate ®le. The sequence of A. pyrophilus, which is not in SWISS-PROT, was reported by Lim et al. (1997b). The P. ovalis SOD sequence was shifted one step to the left from position 41 (SsSOD numbering) until the end of helix 1, and from position 177 onwards, since it was apparent from the alignment that the sequence had been shifted one step.

philus. Indeed, when monomers from T. thermophilus and human mitochondrial SODs are superposed, part of a2 from another subunit in the tetramer of human mitochondrial SOD superposes nearly exactly on the extra helix in T. thermophilus SOD. The C-terminal helix, a6, is considerably longer in A. pyrophilus SOD than in any other of the structures. In A. pyrophilus SOD, the C-terminal helices from subunits A and C, which are antiparallel, pack against each other. The primary sequence of M. tuberculosis SOD continues after the end of the model such that the C terminus would be as long

as in A. pyrophilus SOD if it were present and ordered. The active site and the covalent modification of Tyr41 The geometry of the metal binding site of SsSOD is well conserved when compared with the known SOD structures (Figure 7 and Table 2). The only notable difference in the active site region is the modi®cation of Tyr41, which is discussed below. The iron is ligated by Ne2 of His33, His84 and His174, by Od1 of Asp170, and by a solvent mol-

The angles are taken from: M. tuberculosis, A. pyrophilus (Lim et al., 1997b); E. coli, T. thermophilus (Lah et al., 1995); Fe-form of P. shermanii SOD (PDB entry 1AR5, Schmidt et al., 1996); Mn-form of P. shermanii SOD (PDB-entry 1AR4, Schmidt et al., 1996) and human mitochondrial SOD (PDB entry 1AP6, Guan et al., 1998). The PDB entry 1AP6, which is a Y34F mutant model, was used since the co-ordination geometry of the wild-type PDB-model deviate markedly from the average. P. ovalis SOD was not included in this comparison since the quality of the structure is poor, and B. stearothermophilus SOD was not included since the re®nement of the structure is not completed.

197 abundant slower eluting component gave Mr 24,272, a value larger than the theoretical Mr 24,112 derived from the amino acid sequence; vice versa, the less abundant faster component gave an almost coincident value of 24,117. Similar results were obtained for the sample of native SsSOD used for crystallisation. These data suggest that the heterogeneity observed on HPLC was due to an extra 155 relative mass of the slower eluting component. The proposed covalent modi®cation of Tyr41, consisting of a phosphate group covalently bound to a benzene ring, agrees well with this extra mass. In the other four SsSOD samples analysed the relative amount of the slower eluting component varied within the enzyme preparations, ranging from less than 20 to almost 100 %, but the above mentioned Mr values of the two protein components remained unchanged. The biochemical characterisation of different SsSOD preparations revealed signi®cantly different activity levels. In fact, while the two SsSOD samples used for crystallisation showed similar values of speci®c activity (510 and 690 units per mg for the recombinant and the native enzyme, respectively), the activity values of the other preparations ranged within a great interval spanning from 35 to 1780 units per mg. Such differences in the enzymatic activity could be related to a different heterogeneity of the protein preparations. In fact, samples containing species with similar percentages of modi®ed Tyr41 showed similar activities; on the other hand, the lower the occurrence of the modi®ed enzyme, the higher was the enzymatic activity. The recombinant SsSOD containing more than 80 % of unmodi®ed enzyme showed the highest value of speci®c activity. This ®nding may suggest a regulatory role played by Tyr41 on the catalytic properties of SsSOD. The different extent of modi®cation observed in the samples analysed is intriguing; any relationship with the puri®cation procedure is unlikely.
Figure 8. Tyr41 electron density. Difference electron density map around Tyr41 showing the covalent modi®cation of the tyrosine. The electron density map was calculated as a difference Fobs À Fcalc map, before any attempt to model the residual density, and contoured at 3s. The four crosses in or close to the large residual density feature are four water molecules which are conserved among most of the determined SOD structures, but which are missing in SsSOD due to the covalent modi®cation of Tyr41. The co-ordinates of the water molecules were taken from P. shermanii SOD. Note the ¯atness of the outer part of the modi®cation which indicates that it is due to a ring structure. The drawing was prepared with O (Jones et al., 1991).

ecule forming a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination sphere. The solvent molecule has been proposed to be a hydroxide ion (Stallings et al., 1991; Ludwig et al., 1991). Atomic absorption analysis showed a content of 0.7 Fe and 0.3 Zn per monomer (Dello Russo et al., 1997). Analysis of difference electron density maps of SsSOD revealed an unexplained electron density next to the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr41 (Figure 8). The distance to the density from the side-chain of Tyr41 implies a covalent modi®cation of this residue. Compared with other SOD structures, the Ê tyrosine side-chain is shifted 0.5-1.0 A down from the position of the modi®cation towards His155. The size and shape of the density could correspond to a phosphate group covalently bound to the hydroxyl oxygen of the tyrosine and to an additional ®ve or six-membered ring bound to the phosphate. Accordingly, the model was modi®ed by replacing the tyrosine by a phosphotyrosine and adding a ®ve-membered ring. After re®nement, the Rfree value decreased from 0.198 to 0.194 and no residual density above the 3s level was left in the difference map. To get more insight on the nature of the covalent modi®cation of Tyr41, a molecular and biochemical characterisation was carried out on six SsSOD preparations (three with recombinant and three with native protein), including the two samples used for crystallisation (see Materials and Methods). All preparations were homogeneous on SDS-PAGE. Nevertheless, when analysed on a C4 column connected to a HPLC apparatus, ®ve out of the six samples revealed two protein components eluting at different times; the relative abundance of the two peaks varied within the different preparations. In order to determine the molecular mass of each component, the two protein fractions underwent electrospray-mass spectrometry (ES-MS) analysis. In the recombinant SsSOD sample which produced the crystals used to solve the three-dimensional structure, the 80 %

Figure 9. Accessible surface of the dimer. Plot of the accessible surface of the A/B-dimer coloured according to charge (blue is positive and red negative). Tyrosine 41 and its covalent modi®cation as modelled from the X-ray data is shown as van der Waals spheres in yellow, at the end of the funnel leading to the active site. The plot was prepared with GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).

All these data indicate that the covalent modi®cation of Tyr41 is present in both native and recombinant SsSOD, suggesting that its occurrence could derive from a chemical attachment to a highly reactive Tyr residue. MacMillan-Crow et al. (1998) found that in human mitochondrial MnSOD, Tyr34 (corresponding to Tyr41 in SsSOD) is the tyrosine (out of nine) which is most susceptible to peroxynitrate-mediated nitration. They proposed that this could be due to the charged manganese atom either changing the ionisation state of the tyrosine and thereby make it more susceptible to electrophilic attack, or attracting the negatively charged peroxynitrate. On the other hand, if the modi®cation is enzymatic, then it is more likely that the monomer was modi®ed since the access to the tyrosine is more restricted in the dimer and tetramer. In fact, Tyr41 is situated on the surface of the monomer but in the dimer (and tetramer) it is found at the bottom of the funnel leading into the active site (Figure 9). Implications for enzyme function Tyr41, which together with His37 gate the active site by blocking the entrance to the substrate binding position, has long been assumed to be important for the function of Fe-Mn-SOD since it is

strictly conserved. The inhibitor azide binds to the iron extending out towards the tyrosine (Stallings et al., 1991; Lah et al., 1995). If the substrate co-ordinates to the iron in the same way as azide and is oriented towards the tyrosine, it would be well positioned to make a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Tyr41. It is not yet well established how the protons are delivered to the substrate in the second step of the enzyme reaction (2), but Tyr41 has been suggested to be involved in the direct delivery and as a shuttle of protons from the water molecules found next to the tyrosine outside the active site pocket (Lah et al., 1995). Some of these water molecules are conserved among most of the known SOD structures and are well positioned for delivery of protons via Tyr41 to the substrate. Four of these, which are hydrogen-bonded to each other in other structures, are missing in SsSOD due to the modi®cation (Figure 8). This could contribute to the loss in activity. Mutation studies of Tyr41 in E. coli SOD (Sorkin et al., 1997; Hunter et al., 1997) show that the enzyme retains 40 % of its activity when the tyrosine is replaced by a phenylalanine, but nearly inactive when replaced by a serine (Hunter et al., 1997). The active site pKa of 8.5 of reduced FeSOD, which is re¯ected in a decrease in activity at high pH, disappears in the tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant (Sorkin et al., 1997) identifying the tyrosine as responsible for this pKa. From the pH dependencies of proton exchange in the wild-type and mutant enzymes, Sorkin et al. (1997) concluded that it is the negative charge of the tyrosine at high pH which is responsible for the different behaviour of the mutant. Accordingly, electrostatic repulsion Á of the substrate O2 À could explain the decrease in activity at high pH. Interactions Tyr41-His155 The position occupied by His155 in SsSOD is conserved either as a histidine or as glutamine. It is a histidine in some Fe-SOD structures (M. tuberculosis, A. pyrophilus, S. solfataricus) and in P. shermanii SOD, which functions with either Fe or Mn. In SOD from some other organisms it is a glutamine with a position in the sequence corresponding to either Gly80 or His155 (in SsSOD numbering) depending on if it is a Fe or a Mn enzyme, respectively. The glutamine in this position makes a hydrogen bond to both the metal co-ordinated solvent molecule and to the hydroxyl group of Tyr41, suggesting that this could be a way for the metal to in¯uence the tyrosine (Lah et al., 1995), e.g. to make it supply a proton to the substrate, assumed to bind next to the tyrosine. A histidine in this position can only make a hydrogen bond to either the solvent molecule or to the tyrosine OH corresponding to a 180  ¯ip of the imidazole ring. In M. tuberculosis SOD there is structural evidence for a hydrogen bond between the histidine and the tyrosine (Cooper et al., 1995). The same argument can be applied to SsSOD. With

199 the hyperthermostability is due to an increased number of intra and inter-subunit ion-pairs and to a large buried surface area. The ion-pairs in A. pyrophilus SOD are only partly involved in networks. In Table 3 the comparison between SODs from A. pyrophilus, T. thermophilus and M. tuberculosis is extended to the hyperthermophile S. solfataricus. The number of intra-subunit ionpairs in SsSOD is similar to that in T. thermophilus and M. tuberculosis SODs, in contrast to the elevated number in A. pyrophilus, but the number of inter-subunit ion-pairs is higher in S. solfataricus and A. pyrophilus SODs than in T. thermophilus and M. tuberculosis SODs. In SsSOD there is only one ion-pair network with three ion-pairs, which continues with a network of hydrogen bonds, at the interface between subunits A and C. There are a number of charged side-chains on the surface which are not sterically hindered to rearrange to create more ion-pairs, including some networks. If they would do, under different conditions, then the number of intra-subunit ion-pairs could increase by more than ten. The number of intersubunit hydrogen bonds is not higher in SsSOD than in T. thermophilus or M. tuberculosis SODs (but it is for the A. pyrophilus enzyme). The buried surface area is signi®cantly larger for S. solfataricus, A. pyrophilus and M. tuberculosis SODs than for T. thermophilus SOD. The tetramers of S. solfataricus, A. pyrophilus, M. tuberculosis and P. shermanii SOD are of similar compact form (see above), which could be an important factor affecting the thermostability. The average volume per residue in the enzyme is larger in A. pyrophilus and SsSOD than in T. thermophilus SOD, which is in turn larger than in M. tuberculosis SOD. Table 4 shows the average residue volume and weight for the different structures together with their optimal growth temperature. The average volume and mass correlate well with each other, and these correlate well with the optimal growth temperature. There are four residues which are conserved in all the structures

the imidazole ring of His155 oriented with its Ne2 towards the Fe-ligating solvent molecule, the distances between His155 Cd2 and Trp135 Ne1 and between His155 Ce1 and Tyr41 OH are too short Ê for non-bonding interactions, approximately 2.9 A. With the imidazole ring ¯ipped, the nitrogen groups of His155 are well positioned to form hydrogen bonds to Trp135 and Tyr41, and the distance between His155 Ce1 and the Fe-ligating solvent molecule would be within the limits for Ê sterical contacts (3.2 A) if the hydrogen of the putative hydroxide ion would be pointing towards Od2 of Asp170 (Figure 7). If there would be a water molecule in the position of the hydroxide ion, its second hydrogen would be in too close contact with the Ce1 of His155. It does thus seem to be the hydrogen bond to the tyrosine which is the important function of the residue in the position corresponding to His155. The tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant in E. coli SOD (Hunter et al., 1997) is more sensitive to sodium azide inhibition, which was suggested to be due to less steric hindrance at the active site and to increased ¯exibility when the Gln69-Tyr34 (corresponding to His155-Tyr41 in SsSOD) hydrogen bond is interrupted. In the reduced enzyme the metal-ligating hydroxide ion is assumed to bind another proton (Lah et al., 1995), which would make the interactions with His155 unfavourable when the imidazole nitrogens are positioned to hydrogen-bond to Tyr41 and Trp135. This could lead to a ¯ip of the imidazole ring of His155 with concomitant movement of Tyr41 and/or Trp135, which would be an important change in the active site conformation for the second step of the enzyme reaction (2). Thermostability The three-dimensional structure of SOD from the hyperthermophile A. pyrophilus has been solved (Lim et al., 1997b). From a comparison of SODs from the hyperthermophile A. pyrophilus, the thermophile T. thermophilus and the mesophile M. tuberculosis, Lim et al. (1997b) concluded that

except in the two hyperthermophiles S. solfataricus and A. pyrophilus (see Figure 6): Gly36 (alanine in A. pyrophilus, lysine in all the others), Leu83 (leucine also in A. pyrophilus, asparagine in all the others), Tyr113 (isoleucine in A. pyrophilus, phenylalanine in all the others) and Phe172 (tyrosine in A. pyrophilus, tryptophan in all the others). Gly36 is situated at the entrance of the substrate funnel in the A/B interface opposite to Phe76 (see below). The positive charge of the lysine in this position has been suggested to increase the rate of substrate binding (Sines et al., 1990; Ludwig et al., 1991). Leu83 is buried between the b-sheet and a2, Tyr113 is buried in the A/C interface (but exposed in A. pyrophilus) and Phe172 is found next to the Fe-ligating solvent molecule. In all structures, there is a phenylalanine in van der Waals contact with Tyr41. However, this phenylalanine is found in two different positions in the sequence: either in a2 (Phe76 in the SsSOD sequence) or in the loop between a4 and b1 in subunit B (Pro131 in the SsSOD sequence; see Figure 6). Furthermore, in all structures, except in those of the hyperthermophiles, there is an asparagine or glutamine in position 76 or 131 (whichever is not a phenylalanine) involved in polar interactions in the interface between subunits A and B. The phenylalanine mutant of Tyr34 in E. coli SOD (Tyr41 in SsSOD) showed a greatly reduced activity at increased temperatures (Hunter et al., 1997) which was suggested to be due to the loss of the hydrogen bond between Tyr34 and Gln69 (Tyr41 and His155 in SsSOD). This suggests that the modi®cation of Tyr41 in SsSOD might be involved in stabilising the structure. However, Guan et al. (1998) found that the same mutant in human mitochondrial SOD resulted in a large increase in stability. The Fe-structure of P. shermanii SOD is more stable than the Mn-structure (Meier et al., 1997) suggesting that the active site metal is important for thermostability. Conclusion Apart from SOD, the three-dimensional structures of three proteins from S. solfataricus

are known: indole-3-glycerolphosphate synthase (Hennig et al., 1995), b-glycosidase (Aguilar et al., 1997) and the DNA-binding protein Sso7d (Baumann et al., 1994), also known as ribonuclease p2. Nevertheless, the reason for the hyperthermostability of S. solfataricus proteins remains unclear. It seems reasonable to suggest that there are many different features which promote thermostability (see, e.g. Goldman, 1995). In the case of SsSOD, the compact tetramer and the large number of intersubunit ion-pairs could be two important factors for thermostability. It is likely that the high thermostability of S. solfataricus proteins involves other intrinsic features, such as the extensive usage of bulky and hydrophobic amino acid residues.

Materials and Methods
Purification SsSOD was puri®ed as described (Dello Russo et al., 1997). SsSOD activity was assayed at 28  C by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase method (McCord & Fridovich, 1969). The production of the recombinant SsSOD was obtained through the construction of a vector for the expression of the SsSOD gene in E. coli. Details for the construction of the pT7-7 derivative vector and for the puri®cation procedure will be described elsewhere. The recombinant SsSOD used for crystallisation was homogeneous and indistinguishable from the native SsSOD. Electrospray-mass spectrometry Puri®ed SsSOD samples were loaded on a C4 reversephase column (Vydac, 250 mm Â 4.6 mm) connected to a HPLC apparatus and eluted with a 30 %-60 % gradient of acetonytrile containing 0.1 % (v/v) tri¯uoroacetic acid at a ¯ow rate of 1 ml per minute, gradient time 30 minutes. Elution was monitored at 220 nm; the area of the individual peaks was calculated with a Shimadzu C-R6A integrator. For the electrospray-mass spectrometry (ESMS) analysis the peaks obtained from the C4 column were collected, dried and dissolved in 50 % (v/v) methanol containing 3 % (v/v) acetic acid. The analysis was performed using a Bio Q Triple-Quadrupole mass spectrometer (VG Analytical) at a ¯ow rate of 2 ml per minute. Spectra were scanned in a molecular mass range

Sulfolobus solfataricus Fe-SOD Crystal Structure between 600 and 1400 at 10 seconds per scan. Other details are as reported (Dello Russo et al., 1997). Crystallisation Crystals were grown by vapour diffusion in hanging drops at 21  C. Crystallisation conditions were found using a crystal screen kit (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, USA). The crystallisation conditions were optimised using both native and recombinant protein. Crystals grown in 25 % (v/v) PEG 2000, 4.3 % (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 0.2 M MgCl2 (protein concentration  2 mg/ml) were tested but found to diffract poorly. Later, a crystal which grew in 8 % (v/v) PEG 8000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.5; recombinant protein concentration  2.0 mg/ml) was found to diffract well and was used to collect the data set used for solving the structure. These crystallisation conditions were not tried with native protein. Data collection The data were collected on a MAR imaging plate detector (300 mm diameter but used in 180 mm diameter mode; X-Ray Research GmbH, Hamburg) on a Rigaku Rota¯ex RU-200B rotating anode X-ray source with a copper target. All data were collected on one single crystal at room temperature and consisted of 185 images with 0.5  rotation and another 150 images with 1  rotation. Data reduction The diffraction images were integrated with DENZO and analysed with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1996 ). The autoindexing indicated the lattice to be Fcentred orthorhombic but the scaling gave an Rsym of 40 % compared with 9 % when processed as C-centred monoclinic. The ®nal crystal structure con®rmed that even though the unit cell was consistent with the higher symmetry of Fcentred orthorhombic, the dimer packing was not. The integrated data were scaled and converted to structure factor amplitudes with the CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994) programs SCALA (Evans, 1993) and AGROVATA/TRUNCATE (French & Wilson, 1978). The data collection statistics are presented in Table 5. Table 5. Data collection statistics

Molecular replacement A molecular replacement solution was found with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) with a monomer of the human mitochondrial Mn-SOD (co-ordinate ®le 1ABM, Borgstahl et al., 1992; in the Protein Data Bank, PDB; Abola et al., 1997), including side-chains but without solvent molecules and the iron ion. Two distinct peaks in the rotation search gave correlation coef®cients of 14.4 % and 13.5 %, respectively (next peak at 8.8 %). Estimation of the solvent content indicated a dimer in the asymmetric unit (corresponding with 46 % solvent). The translation search gave a correlation coef®cient of 16.6 % (Rfactor 53.5 %) with the ®rst peak and adding the second one improved the correlation to 27.1 % (R-factor 50.4 %). There were no packing problems and rigid-body re®nement in AMoRe brought the correlation coef®cient up to 34.5 % (R-factor 47.4 %). Electron density maps were calculated and positive density peaks above 5s were found at the assumed metal positions con®rming the correctness of the solution. Molecular replacement was also tried with a homology model from SWISS-MODEL (Peitsch, 1996), based on the PDB entries 1ABM (Borgstahl et al., 1992), 1MSD (Wagner et al., 1993) and 3SDP (Stoddard et al., 1990). This gave the same solution but with slightly poorer statistics. More importantly, the rigid body re®nement made the R-factor to increase to 55 %. To facilitate the model-building, the SWISSMODEL model was nevertheless used but after superposition on the 1ABM AMoRe solution. Model building and refinement An initial simulated annealing re®nement in X-PLOR È (Brunger, 1992b; Version 3.851, topology ®le TOPHCSDX and parameter ®le PROTEIN_REP; Engh & Huber, 1991) followed by Powell minimisation and B-factor re®nement gave an R-factor of 34.0 % (Rfree 42.4 %) with individual, restrained B-factors: Rfree was used throughout the re®nement to indicate if the addition of more parameters was sensible; 5 % of the unique re¯ections were È used (Brunger, 1992a). Maps were calculated and the peaks in the difference maps at the metal positions were now above 7s. The program O (Jones et al., 1991) was used for model inspection and rebuilding. During re®nement strong non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were used (force constants of

300 kcal/mol) between the two subunits, including most of the solvent molecules. There are some differences in crystal packing for the two subunits, but since Rfree did not decrease when the restraints were released for the residues involved, and since the omit maps in general did not clearly indicate any differences, the restraints were kept for all residues. The crystal packing indicates that the following residues might deviate from the NCS: Pro23, Tyr24, Ser94, Gly95, Lys100, Gly103, Ala104, Gly114, Ser115, Asp117, Gln121, Asp198, Glu201, Lys202 and Lys203. In part of the domain connecting region (Ser94-Gly97) the omit maps were not clear, which hindered the analysis of possible violations of the local symmetry in this region. The rms difference between the Ca Ê atoms in the two subunits is 0.01 A in the ®nal model. The Fe atoms were restrained by a harmonic restraint (300 kcal/mol) to their initial positions in each re®nement round. Their atomic radii were set to a small value and the distances to the neighbouring atoms were not restrained. The iron-ligand distances were found to be insensitive to the value of the iron radius. During simulated annealing runs, solvent molecules were restrained by a 20 kcal/mol harmonic potential to their initial position in each re®nement round. Solvent molecules were ®rst added when the crystallographic R-factor was 22.4 % (Rfree 25.7 %) using peak picking in X-PLOR. At this stage ®ve residues and nine side-chains were still missing (side-chains were modelled as alanine instead of the correct amino acid). Inspection and addition of new solvent molecules was done manually. At this stage linear resolution-dependent weights were introduced for the re®nement (W. I. Weis & W. A. Hendrickson, unpublished results), a ``¯at'' bulk solvent model (bulk solvent model parameters: density Ê Ê È level  0.34 eÀ/A3, B-factor  93.6 A2; Jiang & Brunger, 1994) followed by overall anisotropic B-factor scaling. With the ®nal re®nement statistics in Table 6 is also shown the R-factor calculated without solvent correction

Sulfolobus solfataricus Fe-SOD Crystal Structure or without anisotropic B-factor scaling for the ®nal model. In the ®nal model ®ve residues are still missing (1-3 and 209-210). The ®nal model includes 170 water molecules (of which 136 are restrained in pairs by NCS). The rms co-ordinate error in the ®nal model as estimated with a cross-validated sA-plot (Read, 1986; Kleywegt & Ê È Brunger, 1996) is 0.18 A. Water molecules with B-factor Ê above 70 A2 were removed. Re®nement statistics can be found in Table 6. Analysis Hydrogen bonds and ion-pairs were analysed using È X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992b), O (Jones et al., 1991) and with local software (S.A. Svensson, unpublished results). The cut-off distances were the same as used by Lim et al., Ê (1997b), i.e. less than 3.5 A for hydrogen bonds and less Ê than 4.0 A for ion-pairs (Barlow & Thornton, 1983). Analysis of molecular surfaces and volumes was done Ê with a 1.4 A sphere probe using GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991). The protein structure was analysed with the protein structure validation suite at the European Bioinformatics Institute using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and WHAT_CHECK (Hooft et al., 1996). The Kabsch & Sander algorithm (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) as implemented in PROCHECK was used for secondary structure assignments of SsSOD. The structural based alignment was done with the lsq_improve command in O (Jones et al., 1991) which ®nds stretches where the Caatoms are closer than a certain threshold. Default values Ê were used, i.e. a distance threshold of 3.8 A and minimum stretches of three residues. Protein Data Bank accession numbers The structure factors and atomic co-ordinates of SsSOD have been deposited in the PDB (access code 1SSS).
