Structural evidence for specific S8­RNA and S8­protein interactions within the 30S ribosomal subunit: ribosomal protein S8 from Bacillus stearothermophilus at 1.9 Å resolution
Christopher Davies1, V Ramakrishnan2* and Stephen W White1*
Background: Prokaryotic ribosomal protein S8 is an important RNA-binding protein that occupies a central position within the small ribosomal subunit. It interacts extensively with 16S rRNA and is crucial for the correct folding of the central domain of the rRNA. S8 also controls the synthesis of several ribosomal proteins by binding to mRNA. It binds specifically to very similar sites in the two RNA molecules. Results: S8 is divided into two tightly associated domains and contains three regions that are proposed to interact with other ribosomal components: two potential RNA-binding sites, and a hydrophobic patch that may interact with a complementary hydrophobic region of S5. The N-terminal domain fold is found in several proteins including two that bind double-stranded DNA. Conclusions: These multiple RNA-binding sites are consistent with the role of S8 in organizing the central domain and agree with the latest models of the 16S RNA which show that the S8 location coincides with a region of complicated nucleic-acid structure. The presence in a wide variety of proteins of a region homologous to the N-terminal domain supports the idea that ribosomal proteins must represent some of the earliest protein molecules.

Introduction
During the past five years, new insights into the architecture, mechanism and evolution of the ribosome have been provided by detailed structures of individual ribosomal proteins [1]. Of some 50 proteins in the prokaryotic ribosome, the structures of nine have now been determined, six from the large 50S subunit [2­7] and three from the small 30S subunit [8­10]. The structures provide highresolution landmarks within the ribosome and they are also now being used as detailed probes of local ribosomal (r)RNA structure [11]. The eventual aim of this work is the reconstruction of the whole ribosome structure using the improving three-dimensional (3D) models of the rRNA [12] and the increasingly detailed views of the particle afforded by electron microscopy [12,13] and X-ray crystallography [14]. This task has been facilitated by the ability to clone and overexpress the genes for ribosomal proteins [15] which has allowed the more important proteins to be targeted for structural analysis. S8 is a medium-sized ribosomal protein, and its role as an important primary RNA-binding protein in the 30S subunit has been known for some time [16,17]. It is crucial for the correct folding of the central domain of 16S rRNA [18,19], and mutations within the protein have been shown to result in defective ribosome assembly [20]. Neutron diffraction studies [21] and protein­protein crosslinking data [22] have shown that the neighbours of

S8 in the 30S subunit are S2, S4, S5, S12, S15 and S17. In Escherichia coli, the S8-binding site within 16S rRNA has been independently investigated by several techniques including nuclease protection [18,23], RNA modification [24], RNA­protein crosslinking [25­27], chemical probing [19] and hydroxyl-radical footprinting [28]. All agree that S8 binds to an extended stem-loop structure comprising nucleotides 583­653, which is highly conserved [29]. This site has been extensively analyzed by a number of groups, and S8 appears to recognize a small internal loop at nucleotides 596­597/641­643 [30­36]. Fragments of 16S rRNA containing this feature also bind S8 [34,35]. S8 is also one of the principal regulatory elements that controls ribosomal protein synthesis by the translational feedback inhibition mechanism discovered by Nomura and colleagues [37]. S8 regulates the expression of the spc operon that encodes, in order, the ten ribosomal proteins L14, L24, L5, S14, S8, L6, L18, S5, L30 and L15. The S8 protein binds specifically to a region of the polycistronic spc transcript near the start of the L5 gene [35,39]. This region of the mRNA is very similar to the S8-binding site on 16S rRNA [40,41], but subtle differences have been shown to account for the fivefold greater affinity for the 16S rRNA site [35]. Here we present the crystal structure of S8 at 1.9 Å resolution. The protein contains two tandemly arranged domains

of approximately equal size which are tightly associated to form a globular molecule. A number of potential RNAbinding sites have been identified, and the C-terminal domain contains a distinctive concave hydrophobic patch at its surface for potential protein­protein interactions with ribosomal protein S5. The fold of the N-terminal domain is present as a module in a diverse array of other proteins including two that bind double-stranded DNA.

gadolinium derivatives were measurable and provided additional phase information. The overall figure of merit was 0.741 and this improved to 0.853 after solvent flattening. The data collection and final phasing statistics are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The electron-density map was of high quality and allowed a complete and unambiguous fitting of the B. stearothermophilus S8 amino-acid sequence [43] (Fig. 1a). As an independent confirmation of the model, the locations of the methionine sulphurs were consistent with the positions of the selenium atoms determined from the difference Fourier. Only the N-terminal valine was not visible in the initial electron-density map, but excellent density was eventually observed around this residue after refinement. The model was subjected to several rounds of model building and refinement with simulated annealing, using all data between 8 Å and 1.9 Å. The final structure has an R factor of 22.2 %, an R free [44] of 28.8% and good geometry (Tables 3,4). A total of 124 water molecules were also modelled into the structure. A portion of the final 2|Fo-Fc| electron-density map is shown in Figure 1b.
Description of the structure

Results
Crystallization

Crystals of Bacillus stearothermophilus S8 were obtained under two conditions, using ammonium phosphate or sodium chloride as precipitants. Those grown from sodium chloride were large, grew reproducibly and gave excellent diffraction to 1.9 Å resolution, and were therefore used for the crystallographic analysis. The space group was found to be orthorhombic, P21212, and the cell dimensions are a = 80.2 Å, b = 85.9 Å and c = 39.6 Å. Only by assuming that there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit does the crystal density lie within the accepted range for typical protein crystals [42].
Structure determination

Following an extensive search for heavy-atom derivatives for use in the multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) method, four suitable candidates were obtained and used to phase the diffraction data. Three were found by conventional soaking techniques, and the fourth involved the metabolic incorporation of selenium. The principal derivative was obtained with platinum, and two sites were observed in the difference Patterson map which were correctly assumed to correspond to one site per molecule in the two-molecule asymmetric unit. Initial phases from this derivative allowed the three other derivatives to be identified by difference Fourier techniques. These included a two-site gadolinium, a single-site lead and a four-site selenium (as selenomethionine). All sites were confirmed by difference Pattersons and cross difference Fouriers. The anomalous data from the platinum and

Overall, the S8 molecule is relatively compact with dimensions 45 Å × 40 Å × 35 Å, and it contains no regions of significant flexibility. Topologically, the protein is divided into an N-terminal and a C-terminal domain that are immediately adjacent within the sequence. The domains are independently folded but interact closely through an extended interface. Stereoviews of the -carbon backbone and the ribbon diagram are shown in Figure 2, and the locations of the secondary structural elements within the sequence are shown in Figure 3. The N-terminal domain comprises two -helices and a three-stranded -pleated sheet with the connectivity 1­ 1­ 2­ 2­ 3. These secondary structural elements are approximately parallel to each other and criss-cross along the length of the domain. The two helices pack

All of the loops within the N-terminal domain are short apart from loops 5 and 6 which are poorly conserved and disposed at the N and C termini of strand 3. Loop 6 contains the region of primary structure with the highest sequence and length variability (Fig. 3). A striking feature of this domain is the number of charged residues; these cluster at the back of the molecule as

Unlike the N-terminal domain, the C-terminal half has a very unusual structure. It comprises six strands and a short -helix with the following connectivity, 4­ 5­ 6­ 7­ 3­ 8­ 9. The principal feature is an anti-parallel four-stranded -sheet structure which is bifurcated and

deviation on carbons of 0.32 Å. Small differences occur in loop 5, loop 7 and at Lys76 within strand 4, and in the orientation of some surface side chains. The arrangement of the eight S8 molecules within the unit cell conforms to pseudo I222 symmetry, and the crystals have been observed to change to this space group in some heavyatom soaks. This movement of molecules within the crystal is probably facilitated by the relatively small area of contact between the two molecules within the asymmetric unit which is centered on His90 at the tip of the C-terminal domain. S8 exists as a monomer within the ribosome, and the dimer probably has no biological significance.

bent to form two sides of a triangular pyramid. Going from the base of the pyramid to the apex, one side is formed by strands 4, 9, 6 and 7 and the other by strands 5, 8, 6 and 7. Strands 4 and 5 are connected by the highly conserved and structured loop 7, and strands 8 and 9 are delineated by a kink at Ile125. Loop 8 between strands 5 and 6 is in an extended conformation, and it forms the third side of the pyramid along with helix 3. The conformations of three residues (89­91) within loop 8 conform to a 310 helix. The interface between the two halves of S8 is formed by helices 1 and 2 of the N-terminal domain and one surface of the 4, 9, 6 and 7 sheet from the C-terminal domain. Therefore, 1 and in particular 2 are sandwiched between two sheets (Fig. 2). The interface contains conserved hydrophobic residues and represents an interdomain hydrophobic core. There also appears to be several interdomain salt bridges that are common to both molecules in the asymmetric unit and are apparently not dictated by the crystal environment. The two S8 molecules within the asymmetric unit are extremely similar and can be overlapped with a rms

We have developed a strategy for locating potential RNAbinding sites on ribosomal proteins that involves identifying patches of basic and aromatic residues that are highly conserved in their many known primary structures [4­6,8,10]. Although these predictions have yet to be substantiated by the direct visualization of a protein­rRNA complex, they have recently been supported by a number of different studies. These include protein­RNA crosslinking experiments [45], site-specific cleavage of rRNA using Fe(II) tethered to ribosomal proteins ([11], HF Noller, personal communication, and mutational analyses [46]. Several ribosomal proteins also have conserved exposed hydrophobic residues that are candidates for either protein­protein or protein­RNA interactions within the ribosome [4,6]. S8 has a number of potential functional regions distributed over the front surface of the protein, as viewed in Figure 2. These can be grouped into three sites. The overall locations of these sites are shown in Figures 3 and 4, and each of the sites is shown in more detail in Figure 5. Also shown in Figure 5 is the molecule's electrostatic surface potential, which has been useful for evaluating possible functional regions in these proteins [6,10]. Site 1 is located at the top of the N-terminal domain and includes loop 2 and the C-terminal half of 1 (Fig. 5a). It is bordered to the top and bottom by regions of positive potential (Fig. 5d). The top region is composed of Arg20 and Arg70, and the bottom region contains Arg14 as well as Lys76, Lys80 and Arg77 which also border site 3 and are shown in Figure 5c. The sequence associated with site 1 is generally highly conserved, and the adjacent Arg14 and Asn15 are completely conserved (Fig. 3).

Site 2 (Fig. 5b) is restricted mainly to the C-terminal domain and extends across its lower surface as viewed in the normal orientation (Fig. 2). Several of the residues in this site are completely conserved including Arg84, Tyr86, Ser105, Ser107, Gly122, Gly123 and Glu124. The central location of the two glycine residues adjacent to Tyr86 is particularly interesting because they create a gap within the site that may allow for the binding of an RNA molecule. Similar features have been noted in ribosomal proteins S5 [8] and L9 [5]. Site 3 is also in the C-terminal domain and encompasses a large area including the concave inner surface of the pyramid-like substructure (Fig. 5c). It contains the most striking feature of S8 which is a large conserved hydrophobic area flanked by two basic regions (Fig. 5d). The smaller basic region to the left contains the conserved residues Arg94 and Arg117. The larger basic region to the right represents the most extensive area of positive potential on S8 and includes the totally conserved Lys76, Arg77 and Lys80. This patch also borders site 1, as described above. Site 3 is complicated as it has features that are typical of both protein­protein and protein­RNA interactions. The latter include the adjacent residues 128 and 130 which are aromatic amino acids (tyrosine and trytophan, respectively) in the majority of S8 sequences (Fig. 3). Site 3 may represent a docking site for another protein­RNA complex.
Structurally homologous proteins

are homologous with each other [1]. These homologies are not only interesting from an evolutionary standpoint, but they have also helped in understanding the functions of these proteins in the ribosome. To search for protein structures that are homologous with S8, the coordinates were submitted to the program `Dali' [51]. The structure of S8 is not homologous with any of the known ribosomal protein structures, but segments of four other proteins were found to share a close similarity with its N-terminal domain. Each segment contains two helices and three strands with identical topology to S8 and which can be overlapped with C rms deviations of 2.5 Å to 3.5 Å (Fig. 6). The loop regions are somewhat variable and were not included in the rms calculation. In order of decreasing similarity, the proteins are EPSP synthase [52], HaeIII DNA methyltransferase [53], initiation factor IF3 [54], and DNase I [55]. In contrast, no striking homologies were found to the C-terminal domain of S8, although it does share some similarity with the -roll structure in the CAP protein [56].

Discussion
S8­RNA interactions

Most of the known ribosomal protein structures are homologous with other families of proteins [47­50], and a subset

There have been a number of biochemical and mutagenesis experiments to investigate the interaction of S8 with RNA, and these results can now be assessed in light of the crystal structure. Mougel et al. [57] chemically modified Cys126 in the E. coli protein and demonstrated a loss of RNA-binding activity. However, subsequent mutagenesis experiments [58] suggested that this residue is not directly

An alignment of representative sequences of ribosomal protein S8 from bacteria and chloroplasts. The abbreviations for each are as follows: Bs, Bacillus stearothermophilus [43]; Tt, Thermus thermophilus [77]; Ec, E. coli [78]; Ml, Micrococcus luteus [79]; Nt, Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) chloroplast [80]; Os, Oryza sativa (rice) chloroplast [81]; Ev, Epifagus virginiana plastid [82]; Mp, Marchantia polymorpha chloroplast [83]; Cp, Cyanophora paradoxa [84]. The

numbering corresponds to the B. stearothermophilus protein and the regions of secondary structure of this protein are indicated. Blocks of amino acids are colour coded as follows: orange, hydrophobic core residues; green, putative RNA-binding residues; yellow, exposed hydrophobic residues; purple, residues crosslinked to other ribosomal components (see text for details). (The alignment was performed using CLUSTAL V [85].)

involved as it can be replaced by alanine with no loss of activity, although a serine does reduce binding. In the B. stearothermophilus protein, the corresponding residue is a hydrophobic-core alanine, and a modification or replacement by serine at this position presumably disrupts the local structure. In a more comprehensive study, Zimmermann and colleagues [59] carried out mutagenesis on E. coli S8 and then screened for mutants that were defective in RNA binding, based on the protein's ability to associate with the spc operon mRNA. A number of mutants were identified and characterized. When mapped onto the S8 crystal structure, the majority of the mutants correspond to residues that are important for the structural integrity of the protein. However, several are within the putative RNAbinding sites. Using the B. stearothermophilus numbering,

residue 70 is within site 1, residues 86, 87 and 89 are in site 2, and residues 79 and 80 are in site 3. Recent S8­RNA crosslinking data provide additional clues as to the RNA-binding surface of S8 (B Wittmann-Liebold and H Urlaub, personal communication). A crosslink has been identified in the E. coli system between Lys55 and 16S rRNA. This residue is Gln56 in the B. stearothermophilus protein (Fig. 3), but it is a conserved basic residue in most bacterial S8 sequences. It is located in loop 5 at the `bottom' of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 4), approximately equidistant from sites 1 and 2 but at the opposite end of the molecule from site 3. This result suggests that an extended RNA molecule spans across S8 from the crosslink site to one of the putative RNA-binding sites. A

The residues (in standard atom coloring) can be loosely grouped into three sites and these are indicated. The locations of S8­RNA and S8­S5 crosslinks are also shown.

model in which the RNA spans beneath the protein, between loop 5 and site 2, has several attractive features. First, site 2 is the most highly conserved of the three sites and extends towards the crosslink site. Second, loop 5 would be naturally close to an RNA molecule in this position and most easily crosslinked. Finally, the model is indirectly supported by the structural homology of S8 to HaeIII methyltransferase and DNase I [53,55]. In these proteins, the regions that are homologous to S8 both interact with the bound DNA, and the DNA is positioned below the motif when viewed in the orientation shown in

The extreme ranges of red (negative) and blue (positive) represent electrostatic potentials of < ­9 to > +9 kbT, where kb is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. White represents non-polar residues. The molecule is in the same orientation as shown in Figures 2 and 4. Note that site 3 has a large hydrophobic patch flanked by positive potential.

S8­protein interactions

The best candidate for a protein­protein interaction partner with S8, in the ribosome, is S5. The proteins are adjacent within the particle, as demonstrated by neutron diffraction [21] and protein­protein crosslinking [22], and a complex between the isolated proteins has been observed in solution by sedimentation equilibrium studies [60]. As the structure of S5 is known, we are in a position to search for

possible interacting surfaces on the two molecules. A guide to these surfaces has been provided by the work of Gualerzi and colleagues [61] who obtained a crosslink between Lys93 of S8 and Lys166 of S5 using E. coli proteins. The S8 crosslink site is immediately adjacent to the conserved, concave hydrophobic patch within site 3 (Figs. 4,5c). The S5 crosslink site is at the extreme C terminus, which is disordered in the crystal structure [8]. However, there is a conserved convex hydrophobic patch in the vicinity of the S5 C terminus that covers the lower surface of the C-terminal domain sheet. The S5 and S8 patches are approximately equal in size and generally complementary in shape.
The S8 environment within the ribosome

16S rRNA which show that the S8 location coincides with a complicated region of the nucleic-acid structure [12]. Site 2 is the best candidate for the primary RNA-binding site of S8. It is the most conserved, and the extended stem-loop structure of the rRNA site would easily span to the crosslink location within loop 5. Site 3 is an ideal site for interacting with ribosomal protein S5. Not only does S5 have a complementary hydrophobic patch on its C-terminal domain (see above), but this domain of S5 is also known to interact with RNA [11]. The curious hydrophobic/basic nature of site 3 in S8 (Fig. 5c,d) may reflect a docking site for the S5­rRNA complex. This leaves site 1 to bind to a second region of rRNA, and the most likely region is the 825/875 helix where a strong interaction has been observed [28]. S8 is located between ribosomal proteins S5 and S17 which sit above and below the protein, respectively, in current 30S models [12]. The putative interactions of S8 within the ribosome described above would dictate that the C-terminal domain points upwards towards S5 and the head, and that the N-terminal domain points down towards S17. The back surface of S8, which is extremely polar and poorly conserved, would presumably point towards the outside of the ribosome. The detailed crystal structure of S8 will now permit specific mutations to be made to further investigate how the protein interacts with other ribosomal components.

It is now clear that the principal role of ribosomal proteins is to promote the folding of rRNA and to stabilize its final tertiary structure. Consistent with this idea, the structures of S5 [8], S17 [10], L9 [5] and L14 [6] display two apparent RNA-binding regions that can potentially knit together two RNA loci. This idea has now been confirmed by the identification of the two rRNA sites for proteins S5 [11], S17 (HF Noller, personal communication) and L9 [46]. S8 is also known to interact with several 16S rRNA sites that include its principal site in the 596­597/641­643 stem-loop region and two others close by in the 585/755 and 825/875 regions [28]. These multiple RNA-binding sites are consistent with the role of S8 in organizing the central domain. They also agree with the latest 3D models of the

Such studies will be crucial for mapping the environment of S8 which is pivotal to the structure of the whole 30S subunit. Also, as the structures of S5 [8] and S17 [10] are both known and their RNA contacts have been well determined, the opportunity now exists to model the whole S5­S8­S17­rRNA region, which represents a considerable and crucial segment of the small subunit.
Homology and evolution of S8

Although none of the prokaryotic ribosomal proteins can be described as being large by normal protein standards, the larger ones whose structures have been determined, namely L1, L6, L9 and S5, all have two independently folded domains. The L6 molecule has obviously evolved by gene duplication [4], and L1 [7], L9 [5] and S5 [8] appear to be the result of a fusion between two different proteins. This idea is supported by the fact that the individual domains are in most cases structurally homologous to other proteins. Domain I of L1, each domain of L6 and the N-terminal domain of L9 all conform to the split ­ ­ motif that is also found in L7/L12 [2], L30 [3], S6 [9] and the RNArecognition motif [47,62]. Domain II of L1 has a Rossmannfold topology, and the fold of the N-terminal domain of S5 has been found to occur in the double-stranded RNAbinding proteins staufen [49] and RNase III [50]. It should also be noted that S17 is a member of the OB-fold family of proteins [48]. In an evolutionary sense, ribosomal proteins must represent some of the earliest protein molecules, and the observation that their folds are present in a wide variety of proteins, many associated with RNA and DNA, gives credence to this general idea. S8 also clearly follows this pattern, and in general terms it most closely resembles S5. Like its neighbour in the small subunit, S8 has two structurally distinct domains that are fused end-to-end, but they interact so closely through a hydrophobic interface that they form a single globular molecule. Also, as described above, the N-terminal half of S8 is present in a number of other proteins where it represents a central folding substructure. In EPSP synthase, the entire molecule is essentially six of these units arranged as a pair of trimers [52]. In IF3 it is a distinct domain [54], and in HaeIII methyltransferase [53] and DNase I [55], the unit is embedded within the larger structures and contributes to the DNA-binding site.

Our contribution to this effort has been the determination of the structures of important ribosomal proteins. Each structure reveals potential sites of interaction with other ribosomal components, and these, when combined with biochemical data, enable models to be constructed of the local ribosome environment. These models can then be incorporated into the increasingly higher resolution images of the ribosome provided by electron microscopy. The protein structures also permit further experiments to be designed to refine the ribosome models. Here we describe the crystal structure of protein S8 which is a central organizing component of the small ribosomal subunit. It contains two domains, and potential sites of interaction with two known regions of RNA and protein S5 have been identified. S8 is also an important RNA-binding protein outside the ribosome. Its principal RNA-binding site mediates an interaction with polycistronic mRNA in controlling the synthesis of ribosomal components. A considerable amount of biochemical data have been accumulated on the S8­RNA interaction, and the crystal structure will be invaluable for interpreting these results. Finally, similar to other ribosomal proteins, one domain of S8 is homologous to substructures within a number of other proteins, including two that bind DNA.

Materials and methods
Gene cloning and sequencing
The procedure for cloning, sequencing and expressing the S8 gene from B. stearothermophilus using the T7 system [63] was the same as that described previously [6,15].

Protein purification
E. coli cells incorporating the T7 expression system (BL21(DE3)) and containing the S8 expression vector (pET13) were grown in a medium that contained 25 g l-1 of Luria Broth (Gibco) and 25 mg l-1 of kanamycin. Two 1l batches were inoculated with 3 ml of an overnight culture, and when the OD550 had reached 0.6, the cells were induced by adding isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. After 3h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000 rpm, and resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM sodium azide and protease inhibitors. The sample was frozen at ­20°C after adding 2 mg each of lysozyme and DNase to facilitate cell lysis and DNA cleavage. To purify S8, the cell sample was defrosted and spun at 18 000 rpm for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was applied to an S-sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same resuspension buffer. S8 bound to the column under these conditions, and was eluted with a salt gradient of 0­1 M NaCl. S8 eluted at 0.2 M NaCl, and the appropriate fractions were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm and then confirmed by SDS-PAGE gels. The conditions required to incorporate selenomethionine into S8 were the same as those described previously [4,5].

Biological implications
The ribosome is the center of protein synthesis in all cells, and for over 30 years efforts to understand its structure and mechanism have been ongoing. Such an aim represents a considerable challenge because the typical bacterial ribosome contains three large RNA molecules and over 50 proteins. It is generally accepted that the particle is a huge ribozyme in which the ribosomal RNA is maintained in a particular folded conformation by its association with the ribosomal proteins.

Crystallization
Following the elution from the S-sepharose column, the protein was concentrated to 30 mg ml­1 using Centricon-10 microconcentrators (Amicon). The extinction coefficient was estimated at 0.45 based on the amino-acid sequence. The crystallization trials used the hanging drop method [64], initially with the crystal screen protocols I and II developed by Jankarik and Kim [65] but later with additional conditions. In these experiments, 3 ml of the protein solution was mixed with 3 ml of well solution, and the dishes were stored at 22° C.

Data collection
Diffraction data were collected on an Rigaku RAXIS-II image plate system with Yale mirror optics (Molecular Structures Corporation) mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 X-ray generator operating at 40 kV and 80 mA. Data were collected at room temperature by the standard oscillation method [66] using a crystal-to-plate distance of 130 mm. Typically, the crystal was rotated a total of 160° with the spindle axis approximately parallel to the b* axis using increments of 2° and an exposure time of 6 min per degree. These parameters were adjusted with each crystal according to its size and orientation to avoid saturation and minimize reflection overlap. The cell dimensions and space group were determined using the RAXIS-II autoindexing software. The data were integrated, merged and scaled using the HKL processing software [67]. The Friedel pairs from each derivative data set were not merged to allow subsequent evaluation of the anomalous signal. For model refinement, a native dataset was collected at 1.9 Å resolution using a crystal-to-plate distance of 90 mm, 8 min per degree exposure times, and 2° increments in less crowded regions of reciprocal space and 1.4° increments in more crowded regions.

Phasing
A search for derivatives was made by soaking crystals in solutions of heavy-atom compounds in the stabilizing buffer 4.3 M NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. This search was hindered by the propensity of most heavy-atom compounds to precipitate in the high-salt solution. After data collection and processing, potential derivatives were identified by Patterson methods. Three derivatives were found in this way: K2Pt(CN)4, GdCl2 and Pb(CH3COOH)2. A fourth derivative was obtained by the metabolic incorporation of selenomethionine. The platinum difference Patterson showed two clear peaks and was solved by manual inspection, and an initial phase set was calculated using both the isomorphous and anomalous information. These phases were used in the calculation of cross difference Fourier maps which revealed the precise heavy-atom positions in the selenium, gadolinium and lead derivatives. These positions correlated well with relatively weak but clear peaks in the individual difference Patterson maps. Following heavy-atom refinement, all four derivatives were included in a final phase calculation which included the anomalous data from the platinum and gadolinium derivatives. The resulting phases were improved by solvent flattening assuming a solvent content of 51 %. All calculations were carried out using the PHASES package [68].

Noncrystallographic symmetry averaging
Although the initial solvent flattened MIR map was of sufficiently high quality to build a model, it was decided to see whether the phases could be improved further using non crystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging. A region of the electron-density map was extracted that contained the bulk of the asymmetric unit, and the NCS axis which is almost colinear with the b axis was refined. Despite a high correlation coefficient of 0.68 at 3.0 Å, there was no noticeable improvement in the electron-density map after averaging. These calculations were also performed using PHASES [68].

Model building and refinement
MIR electron-density maps were calculated using CCP4 [69] and displayed using the FRODO program [70]. A backbone model was initially built into the electron density and this was followed by the fitting of the amino-acid sequence. The other molecule in the asymmetric unit was generated by applying the NCS transformation matrix. The model was refined by alternating rounds of simulated annealing using XPLOR [71] and manual rebuilding. The correctness of the final model was verified by examining its stereochemistry in PROCHECK [72], its 3D­1D profile [73] and the Ramachandran plot. The secondary structure was analyzed using the program PROMOTIF [74].
