Received 12 May 1992 The crystal structure of RNase Rh, a new class of microbial ribonuelease from Rhi'.opus niveus, has been determined at 2.5 A resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacament method. The crystal structure was refined by simulated annealing with molecular dynamics. The current crystallographic R-t'actor is 0,200 in the 10-2.5 A resolution range, The molecular structure which is completely different from the known sh'uctures of RNase A and RNase T~ consists of six e~.heliees and seven//.strands, belonging to the cc+~ type structure, Two histidine and one glutamie acid resid ues which were predicted as rite most probably functional residues by chemical modification studies are Ibund to be clustered, The sterie nature of the active site taken together with the relevant site.directed mutagenesis experiments (lrie ¢t al,) indicates that: (i) the two histidine residues are the general acid and base: and (it) an aspartic acid residue plays a role of recognizing adenine moiety of the suhstrate. gibonuclease Rh; Crystal structure: Rhicopusniveus; Multiple isomorphous replacement method; Enzyme structure

1, I N T R O D U C T I O N Ribonuclease Rh (RNase Rh) was isolated from Rhizopus niveus by Tomoyeda et al. [1] and purified by Komiyama and Irie [2]. RNase Rh splits the 3',5'phosphodiester linkage of R N A (through 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester as an intermediate) without absolute base specificity. Its base specificity estimated from the time-course of release ofnucleotides from RNA is in the order A > G > C > U and is very similar to that of RNase % [3] or RNase M [4]. The enzyme consists of a single polypeptide chain (Air,. 24,000) of" 222 amino acid residues, the sequence of which has been determined by Horiuchi et al. [5]. As shown in Fig. 1, the locations of the ten halfcystines of RNase g h are almost the same as in gNase T 2 and RNase M, and the sequences around the two histidine and one glutamic acid residues that are suggested to be involved in the active site by Irie [6] are fairly well conserved. The lowest line of Fig. 1 is the sequence of S2-allelic glycoprotein of Nicotiana alata [7]. It is well known that this kind of glycoprotein is involved in self-incompatibility in flowering plants. Although overall homology between Sa-glycoprotein and the family ofRNase Rh, T2 and M is rather poor (about

10%), local homology around the essential residues is fairly high. It was predicted that the glyeoprotein must have the RNase specific activity [8], and in fact McClure et al. [9] reported that glycoproteins isolated from style extracts of Nicotiana ctlata exhibited ribonuclease activities. Therefore, it seems that this new class of RNase involving RNase Rh. T~, M and S-glycoproteins shares a common backbone folding, as in the case of the other class of microbial RNases involving a group of much .~maller (Mr approx. 11,000) gNases, such as RNase St [10] and RNas~ TI [1 l]. Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of a microbial ribonuclease, RNase Rh, determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method at 2.5 A resolution. 2. MATERIALS A N D M E T H O D S 2,1. Crystallizationand data collection
After we had reported crystallization and erystallographic elmraeterization of type I and type 11 crystals of RNase Rh [12], we found that a large number of crystals gave rise to both types of diffraction patterns and it was vet), difficult to obtain pure type I crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experiments, However, on adding divalent cations such as Mg 2.. Ca 2* and Ba"" at a concentration of 10 raM. crystals with distinct morphology appeared, These crystals showed the same diffraction pattern as type I1 crystals but the Bragg reflections were much sharper (type I1'), Therefore, we decided to use type i1" crystals for crystal structure determination. The crystals belong to an orthorhombic space group P2~2j21, with unit cell dimensions a=67.7 A, b=72,5 A, ,-,=44.3 A. The intensity, data were collected using either one of the following tw~ devices: a Rigaku

204, f17: 217-220), belonging to the g+fl type structure [15]. On the surface of the molecule, a cleft runs along the direction indicated by an arrow in Fig. 1. Two histidine (His ~ and His ~°9) and one glutamic acid (Glu l°s) residues which were predicted as the most probably functional reddues by chemical modification studies [16-19] are located on the central fl-sheet consisting of four,8-strands and an r~C-helix running parallel to these strands. The connection scheme of five disulfide bonds which had not been conclusively determined by chemical studies was determined as Cys3-Cys 2°, Cys~°-Cys ~, Cys~9-Cys ~2°, Cys~3-Cys ~: and Cys~'~:-Cys2~. The structure of RNase Rh is quite different from the known structures of RNase A [20] and RNase Tt. However, they have a c o m m o n structural feature that the active site is located on a fl-sheet. Fig. 3 shows the active site of RNase Rh viewed along the same direction as in Fig. 2. As expected, the possible functional residues predicted by chemical modification studies [6] are clustered forming the active site. The carboxyiate group of Glu ~°s is directly hydrogenbonded to imidazole ring of His '~6 while it is indirectly hydrogen-bonded to the imidazole ring of His ~°9 via a water molecule. The distance between the imidazole ring of H i s 46 and that of His 1°9 is about 7 A,. This distance is roughly the same as the corresponding distance between the two catalytic imidazole rings of His ~2 and HisJ J9 observed in the absence of inhibitor ligands [21], favoring the notion that the two imidazole rings of His 4s and His l°9 are the catalytically important groups. Apart from the three "functional' residues, a tryptophan residue was predicted to be located near the active site through chemical modification studies [22]. In fact the indole ring of T I p 49 is found to be located in the active site, hydrogen-bonded to the earboxyl group of Glu ~°5, and partially stacked with the imidazole ring of His ~°9.The function of the indole ring o f the T r p 49 s e e m s to be to fix the orientations of the two side groups. Assuming that the locus occupied by a bound water molecule appearing in the center of Fig. 2 is the site for binding the phosphate group of substrates, the side chains of the following residues are within hydrogen-

bond distance of the phosphate group: His 4~, His ~°~, His I°~ and Glu l°s. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments carried out by Irie and his colleagues (unpublished) show that substitution of Asp st with Ash remarkably reduces only the specific activity toward adenine, indicating that Asp s~ is involved in the binding of adenine base of a substrate to RNase Rh. As shown in Fig. 2, Asp s~ is located 7 A apart from His t°9 in the active site cleft. When R N A binds to RNase Rh along the cleft, the carboxylate group of Asp s~ may well interact with the adenine base. Evolutionarily all the residues but His t°4 shown in Fig. 2 are completely conserved a m o n g RNase Rh, T.,, M and S-glycoproteins. This fact strongly indicates that all of these residues are functionally important and that th¢ sterically similar active site may be found in RNas¢ M, T, and S-glycoproteins as well.
