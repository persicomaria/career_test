The structure of the DNA binding protein from starved cells from Mycobacterium smegmatis has been determined in three crystal forms and has been compared with those of similar proteins from other sources. The dodecameric molecule can be described as a distorted icosahedron. The interfaces among subunits are such that the dodecameric molecule appears to have been made up of stable trimers. The situation is similar in the proteins from Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which are closer to the M. smegmatis protein in sequence and structure than those from other sources, which appear to form a dimer first. Trimerisation is aided in the three proteins by the additional N-terminal stretches that they possess. The M. smegmatis protein has an additional C-terminal stretch compared to other related proteins. The stretch, known to be involved in DNA binding, is situated on the surface of the molecule. A comparison of the available structures permits a delineation of the rigid and flexible regions in the molecule. The subunit interfaces around the molecular dyads, where the ferroxidation centres are located, are relatively rigid. Regions in the vicinity of the acidic holes centred around molecular 3-fold axes, are relatively flexible. So are the DNA binding regions. The crystal structures of the protein from M. smegmatis confirm that DNA molecules can occupy spaces within the crystal without disturbing the arrangement of the protein molecules. However, contrary to earlier suggestions, the spaces do not need to be between layers of protein molecules. The cubic form provides an arrangement in which grooves, which could hold DNA molecules, criss-cross the crystal.

Introduction
Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells), involved in protecting DNA from oxidative damage during nutritional deprivation, was first characterised in Escherichia coli.1 The crystal structure2 of the protein showed it to be a dodecamer with a subunit molecular mass of 19 kDa. Each subunit is an elaboration of a four-helix bundle motif, very similar to that in ferritin,

which is however made up of 24 subunits.3,4 It was subsequently shown that each dodecamer molecule contained 12 ferroxidation centres.5 The molecule with 23 symmetry has an external ° diameter of about 90 A and a central cavity with a ° . The hollow core, with a signifidiameter of 45 A cant net negative charge on the walls, provides an ideal location for iron mineralisation. DNA interacts with the outer surface of the molecule and is shown to form co-crystals with Dps.6 Unexpectedly, the ferritin from Listeria innocua turned out to be a dodecamer similar to E. coli Dps (EcDps), instead of a 24-mer with 432 symmetry.7 This protein is often referred to as L. innocua ferritin-like protein (LiFlp). It has two ferroxidation sites between two subunits related

by 2-fold symmetry, as in EcDps, but no DNA binding property.8 Subsequently, the three-dimensional structures of the two Dps analogues from Bacillus anthracis (BaDlp1 and BaDlp2) became available.9 Both of them have ferroxidation centres, but not the DNA binding property. The neutrophilactivating protein from Helicobacter pylori (HpNap) is also structurally homologous to Dps, possessing ferroxidation centres but no DNA binding activity.10 The Dps from Bacillus bravis (BbDps), on the other hand, possesses ferroxidation centres as well as DNA binding activity.11 Agrobacterium tumefaciens Dps (AtDps) has high sequence and structural homology with EcDps with ferroxidation centres situated as in the latter, but without DNA binding activity.12 Thus, the known structures of Dps and Dps-like proteins have similar 23-symmetric dodecameric structures, with a fourhelix bundle subunit structurally homologous to that of ferritin. All of them have similarly located ferroxidation centres, but only a few possess DNA binding activity. Fast-growing, non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis is often used as a model for the slow growing pathogenic Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The Dps from M. smegmatis (MsDps) has been characterised recently.13 The protein, 183 residues long with a molecular mass of 20.3 kDa, is homologous to EcDps and has been shown to have a dodecameric structure. It possesses ferroxidase and DNA binding activities. It can also exist as a trimer without the capability to bind DNA.14 However, the trimeric species affords protection to DNA through its ferroxidase activity. We report here the structure of this protein in three different crystal forms. This is the first X-ray study of a mycobacterial Dps. Unlike other Dps and Dps-like proteins of known three-dimensional structure, MsDps has a long, additional C-terminal polypeptide stretch. The X-ray analysis reported here brings to light the structural and functional role of this stretch. Furthermore, the structural features of MsDps have been examined in relation to those of other Dps and Dps-like molecules.

for a few side-chains, in the cubic form. The two N-terminal residues are defined in none of the subunits in the tetragonal form. The last C-terminal residue, which could be located in a continuous chain, varied between 165 and 168. Residues 3 to 160 could be located in the subunits in the hexagonal form. The minimum length of a well-defined polypeptide chain in any subunit is thus 157. The cubic form is the only Dps crystal analysed so far containing only one subunit in the asymmetric unit and it provides a good framework for examining the quaternary structures of Dps molecules. The molecule is located on a special position with 23 symmetry and its quaternary structure is wholly defined by crystallographic symmetry elements. It also has been analysed to the highest resolution among the structures reported here. Furthermore, it has the longest crystallographically defined polypeptide chain among the Dps or Dps-like molecules of known three-dimensional structures. Hence, the molecule as seen in the cubic form is used as the reference structure in the ensuing discussion. The rootmean-square deviations (rmsd) in Ca positions among the 12 subunits in the hexagonal form are ° less than 0.1 A as non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were applied in the refinement of this low-resolution structure. They vary between 0.22 ° and 0.31 A among the six subunits in the tetragonal structure. Similar values are obtained when the subunit in the cubic form is superposed on the subunits in the tetragonal form. Thus the structures of the subunits in the two forms are similar within the errors defined by the deviations among the subunits in the tetragonal form. Hence it would appear that differences in crystal packing and the crystallisation medium have no major effect on the three-dimensional structure of the molecule. Tertiary structure As in the case of Dps and Dps-like molecules from other sources, a subunit of MsDps consists of a bundle made up of four helices, designated as A, B, C, D, a short helix E in the middle of a long loop that connects the two ends of the bundle, short loops that interconnect the helices in the bundle, an N-terminal stretch that precedes helix A and a C-terminal stretch that follows helix D (Figure 1(a)). The N-terminal stretch does not exist in the molecules of some of the species (Figure 1(b)). A few N-terminal residues in the A helix also do not exist in a couple of them. Longish N-terminal stretches occur only in MsDps, EcDps and AtDps. The stretch has nearly the same length in MsDps and AtDps. The longest N-terminal stretch, 12 residues preceding the N terminus of MsDps, occurs in the molecule from E. coli. However only four of them are defined in any subunit in its crystal structure. In most cases, including in EcDps, the C-terminal stretch is only two residues long. Five and seven more residues exist in AtDps and LiFlp, respectively. In MsDps, the

Results and Discussion
General features In the present analysis, the structure of MsDps has been determined in three crystal forms, one hexagonal, another tetragonal and the third cubic. The molecule is dodecameric in all the three forms. The asymmetric unit of the hexagonal crystals contains a whole molecule, that of the tetragonal form half a molecule containing six subunits and that of the cubic form a single subunit. The resolutions of the structures in the crystal ° forms are 4.0, 3.0 and 2.85 A respectively. Residues 1 to 175 in the 183 residues long polypeptide chain constituting the subunit are defined, except

stretch is 27 residues long. In fact, MsDps has the longest C-terminal stretch in Dps molecules of known structures. Of these, 19 are defined in the cubic form. The rmsd in Ca positions when known structures are superposed in pairs, vary between 0.37 and ° 1.81 A, while sequence identities between pairs of them range from 24% to 61% (Table 1). As expected, there is a reasonable, though not exact, inverse relationship between sequence identity and rmsd in Ca positions. On both counts, the molecules closest to MsDps are those from E. coli and A. tumefaciens. In fact, in terms of rmsd, these three form one group and the remaining ones another. rmsd in Ca positions between pairs are ° less than 1 A within each group; they are invariably ° more than 1 A in pairs between the two groups. The quaternary structure and assembly of subunits The dodecameric molecule with 23 symmetry

can be described as a highly distorted icosahedron. The nature of the distortion, and indeed the geometry of the molecule, can be described on the basis of the polyhedron formed by the centres of mass of the 12 subunits (Figure 2). Each corner of the polyhedron, say S1, is surrounded by five triangles involving the edges it forms with the five surrounding corners. The lengths and angles in these triangles adequately describe the nature and the dimensions of the polyhedron. The lengths ° and the angles vary by less than 0.3 A and 28, respectively, when the MsDps molecules in the three crystal forms are compared. Thus the effect of crystal packing on the quaternary association of ° the molecule is marginal. Variations up to 2.4 A and 68 in these dimensions are observed when Dps and Dps-like molecules from all available sources are compared. The quaternary structure, however, remains essentially the same in all of them. Referring to Figure 2, S1, S2 and S3, and S1, S4 and S5 form perfect equilateral triangles around two molecular (crystallographic in the case of cubic crystals) 3-fold axes. The edges in the two ° are 32.5 and 40.4 A, respectively. The S1-S6 edge, through the middle of which a dyad passes and which is not involved in the two triangles ° mentioned above, has a length of 22.6 A. The remaining three triangles are nearly rectangular, the three internal angles being 93, 53 and 348. The arrangement is such that these angles are subtended at S1 by S3-S6, S5-S6 and S2-S4, respectively. The above arrangement has interesting implications to the assembly of the molecule, which is dodecameric in all the crystal forms. A detailed examination of the structure indicates that the molecule can be assembled in three different ways (Figure 3). The subunits could first form 2-fold symmetric dimers (Figure 3(a)) and then the dimer could assemble into a dodecamer with 23 symmetry. Alternatively, they could first form 3-fold symmetric trimers and the trimers could form dodecamers using 222 symmetry. Trimer assembly can take place in two ways. Referring to Figure 2, subunits S1, S2 and S3 can form the trimer (Trimer-A, Figure 3(b)) or subunits S1, S4 and S5 can form the trimer (Trimer-B, Figure 3(c)). Because of 23 symmetry, these two trimers occur

at the opposite ends of a given 3-fold axis. It is interesting to explore the likelihood of occurrence of the three possibilities in the known structure. The surface areas buried on dimerisation and trimerisation in the two modes, are given in Table 2. Also given in the table are numbers of intersubunit hydrogen bonds in the resulting dimer and trimers. In MsDps, the non-polar surface area buried on association per subunit is the highest in the case of Trimer-A. The number of hydrogen bonds per subunit is marginally higher in the dimer than in Trimer-A, but this does not appear to be enough to offset the effect of the higher burial of non-polar surface area in the trimer. This is in consonance with the experimental observation of stable trimers of MsDps.14 In EcDps, the non-polar

surface area buried per subunit is the highest in the case of the dimer while the number of hydrogen bonds is the highest in Trimer-A. The reported observation of a trimer as a predominant species and the dimer and hexamer in trace amounts in EcDps,2 indicates that the presence of three additional hydrogen bonds in Trimer-A is enough to substantially offset the effect of the lower burial of non-polar surface area. The values of buried surface area and the numbers of hydrogen bonds indicate that AtDps also could form trimers first, but experimental data are not available in this regard. The non-polar surface area buried on dimerisation in Liflp is nearly the same as that buried in the formation of Trimer-A. However, the number of hydrogen bonds is substantially higher

in the dimer. Therefore, the subunits are likely to form a dimer first. No experimental observation has been reported yet in this regard. In BbDps, the non-polar surface area buried is nearly the same in the dimer and Trimer-B. However, the number of hydrogen bonds is higher in the dimer, thus providing a rationale for the experimental observation of a dimer.11 In the remaining structures, both the non-polar surface area buried and the number of hydrogen bonds are higher in the dimer than in the trimers and one would expect stable dimers in them. The assembly in these structures does not seem to have been experimentally explored. It is interesting to seek a structural explanation for the increased stability of Trimer-A against the dimer in MsDps, EcDps and AtDps. MsDps and AtDps have additional N-terminal and C-terminal stretches in their sequences compared to other similar proteins; EcDps has only an additional N-terminal stretch. Surface area buried on dimerisation and trimerisation and inter-subunit hydrogen bonds were calculated after separately truncating the N-terminal stretch till residue 9 (Ms-Dps numbering) and the C-terminal stretch beyond 157. The results of these calculations are also given in Table 2. The effect of truncation is marginal on dimerisation in MsDps. Trimerisation is, on the other hand, affected. However, even after the truncation of the C-terminal stretch, Trimer-A is the favoured species, in conformity with experimental results (Gupta et al., personal communication). The dimer is preferred after the truncation of the N-terminal stretch. The additional C-terminal stretch does not exist in EcDps. After the truncation of the N-terminal stretch, the dimer becomes the stabler species. In the case of AtDps also, truncation of the N-terminal stretch leads to the dimer becoming the stabler species, while that does not happen when the C-terminal stretch is truncated. Thus the presence of an additional N-terminal stretch appears to be responsible for

the stabilisation of the trimeric species in MsDps, EcDps and AtDps. The values of buried surface area and the numbers of hydrogen bonds in the dodecamer as a whole suggest that the molecules of MsDps, EcDps and AtDps are stabler than those of the proteins from the other species. The situation remains substantially the same even after the truncation of the N-terminal or the C-terminal stretches. The ferroxidation centre and other metal binding sites As in the case of other Dps and Dps-like molecules, MsDps also possesses ferroxidation centres situated between subunits related by a 2-fold axis. One of these centres and its neighbourhood in the cubic crystals, are illustrated in Figure 4. The nature of iron co-ordination at the centre is very similar to that in the other structures and involves interactions with the side-chains of His39, Asp66 and Glu70 and a water molecule. The metal site is, however, not fully occupied. An occupancy factor of 0.4 results in a B-factor comparable to those of the coordinating atoms. This site is clearly discernible in the other two crystal forms as well. The electron density at the site in the tetragonal form appeared to be too high for iron. The crystallization solution of this form contained cadmium sulphate. Refinement proceeded sensibly when a cadmium ion was placed at the site. Indeed, ions such as Cd2þ and Zn2þ are known to compete for Fe3þ binding sites.3,15 A second iron site, close to the first one referred to above, is reported to be present with loose coordination in the HpNap and BbDps.10,11 This site does not exist in the MsDps in any of the crystal forms. In the cubic form however, what has been interpreted as a second iron site with par° tial occupancy (0.4) exists at a location 5.7 A away from the original ferroxidation centre (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Region of the 2Fo 2 Fc (contour level 1s) maps corresponding to a ferroxidation centre in MsDps. Residues from the two subunits coordinating to the iron are shown in different colours. The iron co-ordination is indicated by broken lines.

This site interacts with Asp66 OD2 and a water molecule connected to Glu59 OE2. Its location is different from that of the second metal site in HpNap and BbDps. In the tetragonal form, unexplained peaks remained on the non-crystallographic 3-fold axis passing through the hole through which metal ions are believed to enter the interior of the molecule. These peaks were interpreted as partially occupied cadmium and sodium ions, although the chemical nature of the ions cannot be discerned from electron density alone. The presence of metal ions on analogous 3-fold axis has been reported earlier in ferritin.16,17 DNA binding MsDps is characterised by its long C-terminal stretch in comparison to Dps or Dps-like proteins of known structure from other sources. This stretch has been shown to be involved in DNA binding, a function mediated by the long N-terminal stretch in EcDps.2 The location of the C-terminal stretches in the MsDps dodecamer, around hydrophobic grooves, is illustrated in Figure 5. They are on the surface of the molecule and contain several basic residues, and are therefore appropriately situated for binding DNA involving the surface of the molecule, as in, for example, single-stranded DNA binding proteins18 ­ 21 and nucleosome core particles.22 Electron microscopic studies on the E. coli protein have shown that DNA can co-crystallise with Dps, without disturbing the arrangement of molecules in the Dps crystal.6 It was suggested that DNA is located between layers of Dps molecules.2 This suggestion has been elaborated in the report on the crystal structure of BbDps.11 This structure can be described as a stack of hexagon-

ally close packed layers of Dps molecules. It has again been suggested that DNA could pack within these layers. Such layers do not occur in any of the crystal forms of MsDps. In the tetragonal form, each molecule has four tetrahedrally disposed nearest neighbours. In the hexagonal form, the eight nearest neighbours form an irregular polyhedron. The C-terminal stretch is not defined in either of these forms. It is substantially defined in the cubic form, the arrangement of the molecules in which is shown in Figure 6. Each molecule has six octahedrally arranged nearest

neighbours. The crystal packing is such that grooves run along the crystallographic a, b and c axes. These grooves are lined with the DNAbinding C-terminal stretches. Simple modelling indicates that DNA molecules can be located within them without disturbing the crystal structure. Thus, the present analysis strengthens the model of DNA molecules embedded within crystalline arrays of Dps molecules. However, the cubic form provides an alternative model for the Dps ­DNA complex involving criss-crossing grooves instead of spaces between layers, for the location of DNA. Plasticity of the molecule The availability of several homologues of Dps permits the study of the plasticity of the molecule and its possible structural and functional implications. This was attempted through the delineation of the relatively rigid and flexible regions of the subunits using the Error-inclusive Structure Comparison and Evaluation Tool (ESCET).23 One subunit each from the dodecamers from different species was used in these calculations. In ESCET, a multiple of the parameter s is employed to divide the subunit into rigid and flexible regions.

Though trial calculations, 8s appeared to provide a sensible division between rigid and flexible regions. The regions so delineated are illustrated in Figure 1(a). The N and C-terminal regions, which do not occur in every one of the Dps molecules, are treated as flexible; the deviations in cases where they occur also indicate these to be flexible. There is a stretch of three residues where deletions occur, in the middle of the rigid region. This stretch is treated as rigid. As can be seen from Figure 1(a), the stretches of the polypeptide chains from residues 16 to 80 constitute the relatively rigid region of the molecule. It encompasses helix A except the first five residues, which do not occur in the Dps or Dps-like molecules from every species, the whole of helix B, the loop that connects the two helices and much of the unstructured stretch that connects helix B to the short 83-89 helix. The short helix, the loop that connects it to helix C, helices C and D, the loop that connects the two helices and the C-terminal stretch constitute the flexible region. Unlike in the case of for example, lysozyme,24 ribonuclease A25 and peanut lectin,26 where studies of this nature have been carried out, a single long stretch of polypeptide chain constitutes the relatively rigid region. There are two flexible

Structural Studies of Mycobacterium smegmatis Dps

1111

regions; one made up of a short stretch preceding the polypeptide segment that constitutes the rigid region, and another comprising a long polypeptide stretch following it. The flexible regions are by and large on the outer surface of the dodecamer, while the rigid regions are close to its inner surface. The inter-subunit interface around the molecular dyad is by and large rigid. The ferroxidation centre is situated in this rigid interface. The only notable flexible region in this interface is made up of the short 83-89 helix. The intersubunit interface in Trimer-A around the 3-fold axis is largely flexible. Perhaps this flexibility is necessary for the entry of ferrous ions through the hole in the middle. The interface in Trimer-B at the other end of the 3-fold axis is partly flexible and partly rigid. The segment involved in DNA binding, the C-terminal stretch in MsDps (unpublished results) and the N-terminal stretch in EcDps,2 are highly flexible.

Materials and Methods
Structure solution and refinement MsDPS has been crystallised in three different crystal

forms and the X-ray diffraction data have been collected using an in-house MAR imaging plate system as reported previously.27 The data statistics are given in Table 3. The structure of the cubic form (form III), with one subunit in the asymmetric unit was solved by molecular replacement (MR) method using program AMoRe28 considering one subunit of EcDPS (pdbid: 1DPS) as a search model (155 residues long, nonidentical residues were truncated to alanine). The MR model thus obtained was subjected to rigid body and positional refinement using CNS 1.1.29 Initially, electron density for the eight N-terminal residues and much of the C-terminal stretch were not interpretable. The phase angles were then improved by density modification (solvent flattening and histogram matching) using program DM of the CCP4 package.30 A sigma weighted (FOMDM) Fourier map was calculated with the density modified phases (PHIDM). In this map the density for the side-chains of almost all residues, which were truncated to alanine in the MR model, appeared. R and Rfree were 35.4 and 39.6%, respectively for residues 9 to 155. Three cycles of iterative manual model building using the interactive graphics program FRODO31 employing the sigma-weighted 2Fo 2 Fc map and positional refinement along with bulk solvent correction brought down the R and Rfree to 27.7 and 32.5%, respectively, for residues 1 to 170. Group B-factor refinement and torsion angle dynamics with starting temperature of 4000 K and cooling rate 10 K further reduced R and Rfree to 21.6 and

26.4%, respectively. Water molecules were located based on the electron density with contour level 0.8s in the 2Fo 2 Fc map and 2.5s in the Fo 2 Fc map. One sulphate ion (with occupancy 0.5) and what appeared to be two Fe3þ (with occupancy 0.4) were also located. Several simulated annealing omit maps were calculated in order to improve the definition of the N-terminal (residues 1 to 10), C-terminal (158 to 175) and other (87 to 99 and 122 to 132) regions. An omit map was also calculated in order to remove the model bias by omitting one-eighth of the asymmetric unit in each cycle.32 Two iterative cycles of further model building followed by positional and group B-factor refinement yielded R and Rfree of 19.8 and 24.9%, respectively, for residues 1 to 175. The final refinement and model statistics are listed in Table 3. Structures of form I (hexagonal) and form II (tetragonal) were solved using AMoRe with the structure of form III as a search model, a dodecamer in the case of form I and a trimer in the case of form II. The MR solution of form II contained half a dodecamer in the asymmetric unit, with correlation coefficient and R-factor of 73.5 and 32.7%, respectively, in the resolution range ° 20.0 ­6.0 A for space group P43212. Form I yielded the MR solution (CC and R-factor 77.7 and 31.4%, respec° tively in the resolution range 10.0 ­ 5.5 A) in the space group P63 with a dodecamer in the asymmetric unit. In both the cases the packing was structurally meaningful. Non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints (300 kcal/ mol) were used in the refinement of both the structures. In the final cycles the restraint energy was altogether removed in the case of form II. NCS-averaged maps were used throughout in form I for model building. In the case of form II, NCS-averaged maps were used only in the initial stages. In both the cases, iterative rigid body, positional and group B-factor refinements followed by manual model building were performed. An intermediate model of form II was subjected to torsion angle dynamics. Structural analysis and comparisons All the three models (form I, II and III) were validated using program PROCHECK.33 Structural superpositions were made by using program ALIGN34 and accessible buried surface area was calculated using program NACCESS35 employing all default parameters. Hydrogen bonds were calculated using HBPLUS.36 Calculation of rigid and flexible regions was performed using ESCET.23 Figures were prepared by using the programs MOLSCRIPT,37 BOBSCRIPT,38 RASTER3D,39 INSIGHT-II (Biosym technologies, 1992) and ORTEP-III.40 Atomic coordinates The atomic coordinates and the structure factors of all the three crystal forms of Dps have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB accession codes 1VEQ, 1VEL and 1VEI).
