Abstract Plasmid pMV158 encodes a 45 amino acid transcriptional repressor, CopG, which is involved in copy number control. A new procedure for overproduction and purification of the protein has been developed. The CopG protein thus obtained retained its ability to specifically bind to DNA and to repress its own promoter. Purified CopG protein has been crystallized using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The crystals, belonging î to orthorhombic space group C222I (cell constants a = 67.2 A, î î b = 102.5 A, c = 40.2 A), were obtained from a solution containing methylpentanediol, benzamidine and sodium chloride, buffî ered to pH 6.7. Complete diffraction data up to 1.6 A resolution have been collected. Considerations about the Matthews parameter account for the most likely presence of three molecules in the î asymmetric unit (2.27 AQ /Da). z 1998 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Introduction Bacterial plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements which replicate in an autonomous and controlled way within their hosts. Thus, plasmids maintain a ¢xed number of copies, although copy number of a given plasmid may vary within di¡erent hosts and under di¡erent growth conditions [1^3]. Copy number is controlled by plasmid-encoded elements that regulate the key stage of replication, the initiation event. Initiation is usually mediated by a plasmid-encoded protein (generically termed Rep) which, in many cases, is rate-limiting. Control systems consist in plasmid-encoded negative regulatory circuits, which operate by correcting deviations from the average copy number in individual cells [1]. The control systems do so by either increasing or decreasing the rate of initiation of replication frequency. In some plasmids, replication is controlled by the joint action of a constitutively expressed antisense RNA, and of a transcriptional repressor protein [4^6]. Such is the case of the streptococcal replicon pMV158, which is the prototype of a family of multicopy plasmids replicating by the rolling circle mechanism [6]. In pMV158, the genes encoding the repressor CopG and the initiator of replication RepB proteins are co-transcribed from the single promoter Pr (see Fig. 1A;

[7,8]). The copG gene product is a 5.1 kDa protein (previously addressed as RepA; [8]) which binds to a DNA region that includes the promoter Pr , thus hindering the binding of the host RNA polymerase. DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments performed with puri¢ed CopG showed that its DNA target spans 48 nucleotides (pMV158 coordinates 581^628), the protein binding to ¢ve successive helix turns by the same face of the DNA helix. The center of the CopG-DNA binding region contains a 13 bp sequence showing a two-fold rotational symmetry [7]. Mutations and/or deletions inactivating copG gene lead to plasmids with a ¢ve-fold increased copy number [4,6]. Since the genetic organization of plasmids of the pMV158 family is similar, the same regulatory circuit is expected to exist in all of them [4,6,9]. A region exhibiting an intrinsic DNA curvature was found at the vicinity of the CopG target region and, upon addition of puri¢ed CopG protein, a strong induced bend was found [10]. The angle of the CopG-induced bend has been calculated to be at least of 100 degrees (G. del Solar, unpublished). DNA bends or DNA loops mediated by proteins binding at the vicinity of promoters seem to be a common mechanism to repress or to activate gene expression [11^13]. Initial sequence-based secondary structure analyses of CopG indicated the existence of a putative bihelical unit separated by a short turn. Comparison with transcriptional repressors indicated that CopG could have a putative helixturn-helix motif, both helices spanning from segments Ser-12 to Met-24 (K-helix A), and from Lys-28 to Glu-37 (K-helix B), out of the 45 residues of CopG (see Fig. 1C). In addition, a sequence-based homology search against the proteins deposited in the Protein Data Bank indicated that CopG shares signi¢cant putative structural homology with the phage P22 Arc and Mnt repressors, met myoglobin, a central 37-residue diphtheria toxin catalytic domain segment, segment 61 to 104 of adenylate kinase, and the ¢rst two thirds of the phage VCro repressor. However, analysis of the tertiary structures of these proteins around the theoretical homology region yielded no signi¢cant conclusions. In fact, the regular secondary structure elements deviate in location and spatial distribution, reaching from a single long helix in the case of diphtheria toxin to the helix-turn-helix of the Cro repressor, considered a homology model for CopG [8], or the strand-turn-helixturn-helix structure of the Arc repressor. To investigate the detailed three-dimensional structure of CopG, we have undertaken its improved overexpression, developed a new method for large scale puri¢cation and achieved its crystallization, hereby presenting the preliminary crystallographic results.

Fractions containing CopG were pooled and passed through a tangential £ow device (Mini-ultrasette, Filtron) with a cut-o¡ of 30 kDa. At this stage, CopG was considered to be pure enough (more than 99.9%) for crystallization. The ¢ltrate was concentrated by passage through cartridges (Filtron, cut-o¡ 1 kDa) until the CopG concentration was about 15 mg ml3I . The yield obtained was of 1.5 mg of CopG per 4 l starting culture. CopG concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. 2.3. DNase I footprinting and in vitro transcription assays A 260 bp DdeI-StyI DNA fragment from plasmid pMV158 (coordinates 499^758, containing the target of CopG) was labelled at its 5PDdeI end. DNA (0.67 nM) was incubated with various amounts of CopG protein and further treated with DNase I as described [8]. For in vitro transcription, the DNA fragment (5 nM) used as template was the 842 bp BanI-PstI fragment (coordinates 214^1056). This fragment contains promoters Pr and Ptss , this latter directing synthesis of the countertranscript RNA II. In vitro synthesis of the run-o¡ cop-rep mRNA and of the entire RNA II, in the absence or in the presence of protein CopG (50 and 100 nM), was performed as described [7]. 2.4. Crystallization and X-ray di¡raction analysis Sitting-drop vapor di¡usion method crystallization trials were performed at 20³C and 4³C using aqueous protein of 13^16 mg ml3I concentration in 10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, further 275 mM in NaCl and 0.5 mM in NaNQ . Crystal screens were purchased from Hampton Research. Drops were prepared mixing 2 Wl of protein solution and 2 Wl of precipitating agent solution and allowed to equilibrate against a 0.25 ml reservoir containing the same solution. Crystals were mounted in thin-wall glass capillaries directly from the drop or after addition of harvesting bu¡er for further analysis. Alternatively, they were directly taken out of the original drop with a cryo loop and £ash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen cryo stream (Oxford Cryosystems) at 100 K. Di¡raction data at room temperature or cryo conditions were collected on a 300 mm MAR Research image plate detector attached to a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode generator providing monochromatized CuKK X-ray radiation. The data were processed with MOSFLM v. 5.41 [17] and programs of the CCP4 suite [18]. Further data were collected at the tuneable EMBL X31 beamline of the Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron in Hamburg (Germany).

This is the ¢rst report on the crystallization of a plasmidencoded repressor protein. 2. Materials and methods
2.1. Biological material Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (r3 m3 , gal, ompT, int: :PlS -T7 B B gene 1 imm21 nin5) was employed as the host for overexpression of copG. This strain has a single copy of the phage T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the IPTG-inducible lacUV5 promoter, integrated into the chromosome [14]. Plasmids used were the pMV158 derivative pJS3, which carries a cat gene [15], and the commercially available plasmid pALTER-1 (Promega). This latter plasmid carries genes for resistance to tetracycline, and contains the T7 RNA polymerase-directed P10 promoter. Plasmid pALTER-1 was doubly digested with PstI and ClaI (inactivating the tet gene), and the large fragment was ligated to the 2296 base pair long HgiAI (compatible with PstI) ClaI fragment of plasmid pJS3. This latter fragment contains promoterless copG and repB genes and an intact cat gene. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformants were selected for resistance to chloramphenicol (30 Wg ml3I ). The resulting expression plasmid, termed pALT7:crcat (Fig. 1B), carries genes copG, repB and cat under the control of the T7 P10 promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the entire copG and repB genes in the expression plasmid was determined. 2.2. Large scale puri¢cation of CopG Cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pALT7:crcat were grown in M9 medium [16] to middle exponential phase (3U10V colony forming units per ml), treated with 1 mM IPTG for 7 min, and then with rifampicin (200 Wg ml3I ) to selectively express genes under the P10 promoter [8]. Stability of CopG in the cultures was measured and resulted to be very high. Thus, the induced cultures were incubated for 12^18 h, which resulted in an increased yield of CopG protein. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with bu¡er A (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1% ethylene glycol). All subsequent steps were carried out at 4³C. Pellets from 4 l cultures were pooled and concentrated 100-fold. The cell paste was passed twice through a chilled cell-pressure French Press (140 mPa). Cell debris was removed by high speed centrifugation (30 000 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor), and the supernatant was treated with ammonium sulphate to 50% saturation. After 30 min on ice, samples were ultracentrifuged as above, and the CopG containing supernatant was collected. This was exhaustively dialyzed against bu¡er A containing 1.5 M NaCl. Samples were applied to a 1885 ml (5U96 cm) acrylamide (BioGel P10, Bio-Rad) column equilibrated with the same bu¡er, and the £ow rate was set at 30 ml h3I . Fractions (11 ml) were analyzed for the presence of CopG by SDS-tricine-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As standards, the commercially available Mark12 protein mixture (Novex) was used. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against bu¡er B (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 5% ethylene glycol) containing 100 mM KCl. The sample was applied to a 98 ml (2.5U20 cm) heparin-agarose (A¤-Gel, Bio-Rad) column, and the £ow rate was set at 70 ml h3I . Table 1 Data collection and processing statistics

3. Results and discussion The new plasmid vector employed for the overproduction of CopG (Fig. 1B), in conjunction with the procedure developed here for the scale-up puri¢cation of CopG protein, have proved to be excellent. The degree of puri¢cation achieved has been very high (Fig. 2A), and CopG has been shown to be soluble under all conditions tested. This, and the remarkable high stability of CopG within the cell cultures, has allowed us to purify large quantities of this rather small protein. To test

whether this new procedure of puri¢cation yielded an active protein, we performed two tests: (i) DNA binding of CopG to its target DNA, and (ii) CopG-mediated speci¢c inhibition of transcription from Pr promoter. Binding of puri¢ed CopG was tested by DNase I footprinting experiments on the coding strand. The results showed the presence of ¢ve protected regions, which encompass a 13 bp symmetric element, and the 335 and 310 regions of promoter Pr (Fig. 2B). Thus, at a molar ratio of 6 CopG dimers per DNA molecule, more than 90% of the DNA was bound by CopG, indicating that the protein puri¢ed by this new procedure binds e¤ciently to its DNA target [8]. In vitro transcription assays were performed with a template pMV158-DNA fragment which carries promoter Pr (the one regulated by CopG), and the constitutive Ptss promoter (directing synthesis of the antisense RNA II). The DNA (5 nM) was incubated without CopG or with two concentrations of the protein (50 and 100 nM) prior to the addition of the RNA polymerase. The results (Fig. 2C) showed that CopG speci¢cally inhibited synthesis of the cop-rep mRNA from promoter Pr , whereas transcription from Ptss was una¡ected by the presence of the protein. These results indicate that CopG retained its functionality as a transcriptional repressor.

Initially, crystal screens I and II based on the incomplete factorial approach and on sparse matrix sampling [19,20], systematic ammonium sulfate, sodium/potassium phosphate, sodium chloride and sodium citrate screenings considering di¡erent pH values and salt concentrations were assayed. Needles were obtained with 70% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD)/0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5. After several optimization steps including additives and detergents, best crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained from drops mixed from 4 Wl protein solution and 2 Wl of precipitating agent solution, consisting of 72% MPD/0.1 M HEPES pH 6.7, and 0.5 Wl of 20% (w/v) benzamidine/HCl solution (Fig. 3A). These crystals did not resist harvesting (with 90^100% MPD) nor direct mounting into a capillary for X-ray analysis. Considering the high percentage of MPD in the crystallization conditions, £ashfreezing was experimented. These crystals di¡racted properly î (Fig. 3B) beyond 1.6 A resolution and belong to orthorhomî bic space group C222I with cell constants a = 67.2 A, b = 102.5 î î A, c = 40.2 A. Complete di¡raction data have been collected from three crystals using cryo-cooling. The crystals result in being very isomorphous to each other and the data mergeable. A summary of the data collection and processing statistics is provided in Table 1.

were obtained from molecular replacement calculations performed with AMoRe [22], the search for heavy-ion derivatives was started. Because no suitable harvesting bu¡er was found, putative heavy-ion containing derivatives were prepared by adding small amounts of product directly to the drops and allowing to equilibrate for several days or weeks. No positive results were obtained by this method. An alternative approach consisting of co-crystallizing CopG in the presence of small amounts of heavy-ion compounds proved to be successful. A crystal obtained in the presence of Et-Hg-Cl was measured î (see Table 1) at the Hg fmx H wavelength of 1.002 A at the DESY (Hamburg), rendering a clear resolution-consistent peak in the anomalous Patterson map consistent with position (0.106, 0.196, 0.470; height 4.53 c). The collection of further derivative data for proper phasing is currently under way.
