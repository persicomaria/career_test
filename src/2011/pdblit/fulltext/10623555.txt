ABSTRACT We have calculated the electrostatic potential and interaction energies of ionizable groups and analyzed the response of the protein environment to redox changes in Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase by using a continuum dielectric model and finite difference technique. Subsequent Monte Carlo sampling of protonation states enabled us to calculate the titration curves of all protonatable groups in the enzyme complex. Inclusion of a model membrane allowed us to restrict the calculations to the functionally essential subunits I and II. Some residues were calculated to have complex titration curves, as a result of strong electrostatic coupling, desolvation, and dipolar interactions. Around the heme a3-CuB binuclear center, we have identified a cluster of 18 strongly interacting residues that account for most of the proton uptake linked to electron transfer. This was calculated to be between 0.7 and 1.1 H per electron, depending on the redox transition considered. A hydroxide ion bound to CuB was determined to become protonated to form water upon transfer of the first electron to the binuclear site. The bulk of the protonation changes linked to further reduction of the heme a3-CuB center was calculated to be due to proton uptake by the interacting cluster and GluII-78. Upon formation of the three-electron reduced state (P1), His325, modeled in an alternative orientation away from CuB, was determined to become protonated. The agreement of these results with experiment and their relevance in the light of possible mechanisms of redox-coupled proton transfer are discussed.

membrane of mitochondria and many bacteria, and catalyzes electron transfer from cytochrome c to molecular oxygen, reducing the latter to water. The reaction is accompanied by vectorial proton transport through the membrane, a process that is generally referred to as proton pumping. The resulting proton and voltage gradient is then employed by the F0F1-ATP synthase for phosphorylation of ADP, yielding ATP. The structure of the oxidized, azide-treated cytochrome c oxidase from the soil bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans has been determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.8-Å resolution (Iwata et al., 1995). The protein consists of four subunits (cf. Fig. 3 a); subunit I is the largest, with 12 transmembrane helices arranged in three symmetry-related semicircles. Subunit II contains two transmembrane helices and a large periplasmic domain with a fold similar to that of type I copper proteins. Subunits III and IV consist of seven and one transmembrane helices, respectively, and only small periplasmic or cytoplasmic segments. The three mitochondrially encoded subunits of the 13-subunit bovine heart enzyme, the crystal structure of which was reported recently at 2.8 Å (Tsukihara et al., 1996), were found to be remarkably similar to their bacterial homologs. Cytochrome c oxidase contains four redox-active cofactors: a CuA, a low-spin heme (heme a) and a heme a3-CuB binuclear center. The hemes and CuB are located in subunit I, and the CuA center belongs to subunit II. Electrons from cytochrome c are accepted by CuA and then transferred via heme a to the binuclear center, where oxygen reduction takes place. The catalytic cycle of the oxygen reduction is summarized in Fig. 1 (Babcock and Wikstrom, 1992, with ¨ modifications). Upon uptake of the first electron by the fully oxidized (O) enzyme, the one-electron reduced intermediate (E) is formed, which subsequently becomes further reduced to the two-electron reduced R-state to which oxygen can bind. Oxygen binding, via formation of compound A

Bold italic letters refer to different redox states of the binuclear site, namely the fully oxidized state (O), the one-electron reduced intermediate (E), the fully reduced state (R) that is converted into compound A upon oxygen binding, the peroxy state before (P) and after (P1) uptake of the third electron, the oxoferryl (F) state, and the hydroxy state (H).

(Chance et al., 1975), leads to the peroxy state P, the structure of which is still uncertain. Transfer of the third electron via CuA and heme a then traps the oxygen within the binuclear center (Verkhovsky et al., 1994, 1996); the corresponding intermediate is referred to as P1. Upon scission of the O-O bond and formation of the first water molecule, the stable oxoferryl or F-state is produced (Varotsis and Babcock, 1990). Input of the fourth electron leads to the hydroxy intermediate H and, after release of the second water molecule, to the regeneration of the O-state. The associated generation of a proton gradient across the membrane is the outcome of two processes: the uptake of "chemical" protons from the cytoplasm that are required for water formation and the translocation of "pumped" protons from the cytoplasm into the periplasm. Analysis of membrane potential effects (Wikstrom, 1989) and time-resolved ¨ charge-translocation measurements on reconstituted enzyme (Verkhovsky et al., 1997) have shown that only the P 3 F and F 3 O transitions are coupled to proton pumping. However, the molecular mechanism by which this coupling is achieved is still unclear. Previous proposals involve ligand exchanges and protonations on CuB (Wikstrom et al., 1994), on heme a3 (Rousseau et al., 1993), or ¨ between the two metals (Woodruff, 1993). On the grounds of possible multiple orientations and conformations for the side chain of the CuB ligand His325, Iwata et al. (1995) have favorably discussed the "histidine cycle" model of Wik-

strom et al. (1994), with the histidine cycling through two ¨ different orientations and three different protonation states dependent on the redox state of the enzyme. The model is in agreement with the electroneutrality principle (Rich, 1995), which postulates that reduction of the binuclear center causes the uptake of protons from the cytoplasm to maintain electroneutrality. These protons are then expelled into the periplasm through electrostatic repulsion from the incoming "chemical" protons required for water formation. Critical within such a model is the identity of the groups that become protonated upon electron transfer to the binuclear site. Two different pathways for chemical and pumped protons were indicated by site-directed mutagenesis experiments where the mutation prevented proton pumping but still allowed water formation (Thomas et al., 1993; Fetter et al., 1995; Garcia-Horsman et al., 1995). Iwata et al. (1995) proposed two such pathways for the Paracoccus enzyme. The pathway for protons to be consumed involves residues Ser291, Lys354, Thr351, and Tyr280, and the pathway for protons to be pumped was suggested to include Asp124, Thr203, Asp199, Asp113, Asp131, and Tyr35. Beyond the latter residue, a presumably solvent-filled cavity leads to the highly conserved Glu278. From there the pathway seems less clear but may involve Pro277, from which it could reach the binuclear site. However, recent investigations using site-directed mutants (Konstantinov et al., 1997) indicate that the former pathway may be used in the first, so-called eu-oxidase part of the catalytic cycle, whereas the latter pathway is of importance only for the second, peroxidase part of the reaction. The aim of the work presented here was to gain further insight into the coupling of proton translocation to electron transfer by using electrostatic calculations. Similar methods have recently been applied to other systems such as the photosynthetic reaction centers of Rb. sphaeroides (Beroza et al., 1995; Gunner and Honig, 1992) and Rp. viridis (Lancaster et al., 1996). A continuum dielectric model and finite difference technique were used to determine the electrostatic potential in and around cytochrome c oxidase and to identify residues that are strongly electrostatically coupled. Monte Carlo sampling allowed the determination of the average protonation of all titratable residues as a function of pH and dependent on the redox state of the enzyme.

METHODS Coordinates
Calculations were based on the nonhydrogen coordinates of subunits I and II of the P. denitrificans enzyme (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry code 1ar1, Ostermeier et al., 1997). This set of coordinates contains a magnesium ion bound to His403, Asp404, GluII-218 and a water molecule, similar to the Mg site proposed for the bovine heart enzyme (Tsukihara et al., 1995). Fann et al. (1995), through extended x-ray absorption fine structure and electron nuclear double-resonance spectroscopy experiments at high pH,

have suggested a water molecule or hydroxide ion as a fourth ligand to CuB that could account for the strong antiferromagnetic coupling of the heme a3 iron and the copper. This water was modeled (Fig. 2 a) at a distance of 1.95 Å from the copper, in agreement with the data of Fann et al. (1995), assuming a distorted tetrahedral coordination of the copper center. It was generally included, but was omitted from a separate series of calculations, as indicated in the Results section. For the relevant redox states, an oxygen molecule bound to heme a3 was modeled in analogy to the heme-bound oxygen molecule in oxygenated hemoglobin (Condon and Royer, 1994). Because, in the original structure obtained with the oxidized enzyme in the presence of azide (Iwata et al., 1995), the orientation of the CuB ligand His325 could not be observed crystallographically, its side chain was modeled in two different conformations: as a ligand to CuB and in an alternative orientation away from the copper (cf. Fig. 2 b; see Results section for details). We have included a membrane model (Fig. 3 b) that shields the membrane-exposed protein surface from the solvent. The membrane is represented by a lattice of carbon atoms that are 3 Å apart and form a layer of thickness 27 Å, mimicking the hydrophobic part of the membrane (Lancaster et al., manuscript in preparation). Inclusion of this membrane model also allowed us to restrict the calculations to subunits I and II, saving CPU time. Previous studies have shown that the two-subunit enzyme is active in proton pumping (Haltia et al., 1989; Hendler et al., 1991). Protons were added with the program PROTEUS (A. Joguine and M. R. Gunner, City College of New York, unpublished observations), which is distributed as part of the GRASP package (Nicholls et al., 1991). This program orients protons on water molecules or hydroxyl groups to minimize the electrostatic interaction free energy of the proton with residues within 4.5 Å of the considered group.

Calculation of electrostatic energies and individual site titration curves
Calculations were performed as developed by M. R. Gunner (City College New York), implemented locally by Lancaster (1996), and described by Lancaster et al. (1996). The program DelPhi (Gilson et al., 1987; Nicholls and Honig, 1991) was used to solve the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential in and around cytochrome c oxidase. The protein interior was assigned a dielectric constant of 4, whereas 80 was used for the solvent. The molecular surface of the protein as the boundary between high- and low-dielectric media was defined by a solvent probe of radius 1.4

Å (Connolly, 1983). A series of four focusing calculations was performed with a final grid spacing of 1.0 Å/grid. Charge distributions for amino acid side chains were taken from the CHARMM set of charges (Brooks et al., 1983). Arg, Asp, Cys, Glu, His, Lys, and Tyr residues, heme propionates, and chain termini were treated as titratable residues. However, histidines liganding copper atoms or heme irons were considered neutral. Preliminary calculations explicitly including the possibility of deprotonation of the CuB-ligating histidines to their imidazolate forms showed the histidines to be already neutral in the fully oxidized state of the enzyme. Furthermore, treating the His ligands as deprotonatable is problematic, because of the present level of resolution, the absence of model compounds, and the resulting uncertainty about the correct metal-to-ligand distances, to which the ionization states of the ligands are highly sensitive. The copper atoms were given charges of 0.75/0.25 and 1.0/0.0 for the oxidized/reduced forms of CuA and CuB, respectively. The remaining charges of 0.75 and 1.0 for CuA and CuB were evenly distributed over the liganding atoms. Thus, in the case of CuB, the ligating histidines were given a 0.33 charge on their ligating atoms or, when a hydroxide ion was included as a fourth ligand, a 0.25 charge, and the remaining 0.25 was assigned to the hydroxide, giving it a net charge of 0.75. Charge assignments to the heme atoms were as described by Lancaster et al. (1996); additional partial charges were put on the formyl ( 0.55/ 0.55 for the carbon and oxygen atoms, respectively) and hydroxyalkyl groups (C: 0.25, O: 0.65, H: 0.40). The electrostatic contribution to the free energy of a charge in the protein is the sum of three different energy terms: the reaction field energy, Grxn, the dipolar interaction energy, Gpol, and the interaction energy with other ionizable residues, Gcrg. The reaction field energy accounts for the polarization of electrons and dipoles in the surrounding medium, which stabilizes a charge. Transferring a charge from such a high-dielectric medium into an environment with a low dielectric constant leads to a loss of reaction field energy, Grxn, which is often referred to as the desolvation penalty. Thus, in a lowdielectric medium, the protonation equilibrium of a titratable residue is shifted toward the neutral form, resulting in a change in pK, pKdesolv. The term Gpol takes into account the interaction with permanent dipoles such as the polar groups of the protein backbone or polar amino acid side chains. pK changes due to Grxn and Gpol can be combined to yield the "intrinsic" pK, pKint, which is the pK of the considered group when all other titratable residues in the protein are in their neutral state

(1995): as a ligand to CuB (I) and in its "free" orientation (II) hydrogen-bonded to the heme a3 formyl group (CHO), the carbonyl oxygen of Phe340, and the OH group of Tyr328.

partition function. However, for proteins with more than 25 titration sites, this approach becomes prohibitively time-consuming. Instead, we have used a Monte Carlo algorithm as described by Lancaster et al. (1996) to calculate individual site titration curves for different redox states of the 106 preenzyme. A total of 3.2 106 Monte Carlo steps (after 1.6 equilibration steps) were applied to determine the average ionization of each site over the pH region between 4.0 and 11.5. Strongly coupled residues with a Gcrg greater than 2 pK units were permitted to change their protonation state simultaneously in a single Monte Carlo step over 50% of the time, as suggested by Beroza et al. (1991). Water molecules, with the exception of the ligands to the magnesium and the binuclear site, were not explicitly included in the calculations. It has been pointed out by Yang et al. (1993) and Lancaster et al. (1996) that the explicit treatment of buried water molecules is difficult, because there are no unique positions for the water hydrogen atoms. Upon protonation or deprotonation of a nearby residue, the hydrogen atoms might change their position to stabilize the protonation state of the residue through the formation of hydrogen bonds. As our approach cannot account for such positional fluctuations, the error introduced by explicitly including the buried waters may well be greater than the error caused by leaving them out. However, our version of DelPhi implicitly includes the stabilization of charges or dipoles by assigning a dielectric constant of 80 to each cavity within the protein that is large enough to accommodate a water molecule. Hence bound water molecules are treated as a high-dielectric continuum, which, however, underestimates the stabilization effects of highly directed hydrogen bonds (Yang et al., 1993). As shown by Yang et al. (1993) in a study with T4 lysozyme, the likely deviation from experimental values introduced by the continuum approximation can extend to 2 pK units. In their case, explicitly including bound waters was found to only marginally improve the agreement with experiment.

RESULTS Electrostatic interactions between residues in the fully oxidized state Subunits I and II of cytochrome c oxidase contain 151 residues that were considered protonatable: 19 Arg, 26 Asp, 6 nonligated Cys, 25 Glu, 15 nonligated His, 18 Lys, 36 Tyr, 4 heme propionates, 1 C-terminus and 1 N-terminus (residues 1­16 and 550 ­554 of subunit I are not defined in the crystal structure). In addition, two water molecules were explicitly included, as described in the Methods section. A "core" cluster of 18 of these 151 titratable residues (cf. Table 1) was found to strongly electrostatically interact with the cofactors, either directly or indirectly (i.e., via other titratable residues). The term "strong" is used for interactions that correspond to a change in pK by at least 2 pK units, that is, with interaction energies larger than 2.74 kcal/mol. Tyr (with the exception of Tyr280; see below) and Cys residues were omitted from the cluster because they were calculated to be neutral in all redox states and at all pH values. Calculated desolvation penalties and polar interaction energies are included in Table 1. The loss of reaction field energy, Grxn, can become large enough to shift the pKa by as much as 12.9 pK units. The latter value applies to the ring A propionate of heme a (Pra a), the carboxyl oxygens of which are 10 Å away from the protein-solvent boundary. The term in addition to Grxn that influences the intrinsic pK is the charge-dipole interaction energy, Gpol. It arises from interactions with polar side chains and dipoles

It should be noted that in the above equation pKdesolv is always nonnegative, whereas pKpol is positive for basic and negative for acidic residues when Gpol 0, and vice versa when Gpol 0. Unlike Grxn and Gpol, Gcrg is dependent on pH in that it is a function of the average protonation xi for all titratable residues i within the protein. It is possible to compute xi by calculating the complete

of the protein backbone and can often compensate for the loss of reaction field energy. The latter, for example, is the case for the two heme a propionates, where the charged state is stabilized by 12.0 (ring A propionate, Pra) and 10.6 (ring D propionate, Prd) pK units, respectively. For Pra, this is mainly due to interactions with the backbone carbonyls of Arg473 and Arg474, the formyl group of heme a, and the amide group of the Trp475 indole ring. In the case of Prd, charge stabilization is the result of interactions with the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 88, 94, 95, 163, and 164, and the side-chain amide group of Asn88. However, the region of positive potential around the heme a propionates (cf. Fig. 4 for the contribution of the backbone to Gpol) has the opposite effect on the two arginines 473 and 474, i.e., the charged state of these two residues is further destabilized through polar interactions. For Arg474, this mainly results from interactions with the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 163­166 and 170 that are oriented with the carbonyl oxygen atoms pointing away from the protonatable groups of the arginine. A region of negative potential generated by polar sites was found around Arg54, stabilizing the protonated state of the arginine. This occurs despite a strong interaction with the side-chain amide of Asn486, which destabilizes the charge by 3.7 pK units, as that is overcompensated by interactions with the side chains of Gln463, Ser489, Ser490

and the heme a formyl group (together 7.3 pK units) and the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 50, 459, 482, 483, 486, 487, and 490 ( 3.3 pK units; cf. Fig. 4). Within the core of interacting titratable residues mentioned above, there are 69 charge-charge interactions with energies greater than 2 pK units, not including the interactions with the cofactor metals. One of the strongest interactions is that between Asp399 and the ring A propionate of heme a3 (Pra a3). The two carboxyl groups are only 3.3 Å apart at their closest oxygen-oxygen distance (cf. Fig. 6). The deprotonated state of one of the two residues is thus destabilized by the charged state of the other, whereas the net protonation of the coupled system Asp399 Pra a3 will depend on the interaction with the environment. Consequently, the two groups were found to share a single proton over the whole pH range considered. Other very strong charge-charge interaction energies ( 10 pK units), although between oppositely charged groups, were determined for the interaction of the two arginines 473 and 474 with the ring D propionates of hemes a and a3. The charge-charge interaction energy between the two hemes was calculated as 2.5 pK units. Thus, reduction of either heme will lower the midpoint potential and hence decrease the affinity for electrons of the other heme by 145 mV (as proposed in the "neoclassical model" by Nicholls, 1974), a value that is in reasonable agreement with

the experimentally determined value of 124 mV (Wilson et al., 1972; reviewed by Wikstrom et al., 1976). ¨ Calculation of titration curves Individual site titration curves were calculated for different redox states of the enzyme by Monte Carlo sampling. The isoelectric point for the fully oxidized state of the enzyme was determined as 4.6, a value that agrees well with the

experimentally observed value (4.5; C. Ostermeier, personal communication). At pH 7.0, all Arg, all but seven Asp, all but nine Glu, all but four Lys, and the four heme propionates were determined to be fully charged, whereas all but three His, and all nonligated Cys and Tyr (with the exception of Tyr280; see below) residues were found to be in their neutral states. Titration patterns of many residues deviate significantly from the standard Henderson-Hasselbalch curve for a single

titratable site, as previously reported for other systems (Bashford and Gerwert, 1992; Beroza et al., 1995; Lancaster et al., 1996). Some residues have fixed protonation states over the whole pH range (4 ­11.5) of the calculations. For example, Lys354 was determined to be in its neutral state over the entire pH range considered, which is due to the large desolvation penalty of 11.1 pK units and the lack of significant compensating dipolar or charge-charge interactions. Control calculations using the coordinates of the bovine heart enzyme (POB entry code, 10CC, Tsukihara et al., 1996) yielded the same result (data not shown). For other residues, however, large desolvation penalties and unfavorable polar interactions were found to be overcompensated by charge-charge interactions that stabilize the charged state. Arg473, for instance, was calculated to be fully protonated (i.e., charged) between pH 4 and 11.5, despite having an intrinsic pK of as small as 1.2. This is due to strong electrostatic interactions with 17 other residues and cofactors, the strongest ones being with two heme propionates and Arg474. The salt bridges to the ring D propionates of hemes a and a3 alone stabilize the charged state of Arg473 by 21.3 pK units (Table 1) and are only partially compensated for by the charge-destabilizing interaction with Arg474 (7.6 pK units). Another example is the residue AspII-35, which, though having a pKint of 7.9, was calculated to be fully deprotonated. The main reason for this is a salt bridge to Arg468 (su I) that alone shifts the pKa of the aspartate by as much as 7.5 pK units. Correspondingly, the arginine was calculated to be fully protonated between pH 4 and 11.5. This salt bridge could contribute significantly to the stabilization of the multisubunit complex. As already mentioned, Asp399 and Pra a3 were calculated to share a single proton between pH 4 and 11.5. As a result of an additional hydrogen bond to the propionate from His403, Pra a3 was determined to be fully charged (i.e., the proton was calculated to reside on Asp399). Dependence of the average protonation on the redox state Upon reduction of a cofactor, the protonation equilibria of nearby titratable residues are altered as the loss of a positive charge destabilizes the charged state of acidic and stabilizes the protonated state of basic residues. In this study we have modeled the catalytic cycle of cytochrome c oxidase (see Fig. 1) and calculated the electrostatic response and changes in protonation linked to changes in the redox state of the protein. We will focus mainly on the protonation changes that occur in response to electron transfer to the heme a3­CuB binuclear center.
Changes in average protonation upon reduction of the binuclear center

reduced intermediate E (Babcock and Wikstrom, 1992). ¨ Uptake of the second electron and subsequent transfer to the binuclear center lead to the R state in which the binuclear center is fully reduced and ready to bind an oxygen molecule (Fig. 1). Calculated changes in average protonation linked to redox reactions at the binuclear site are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 5. Upon formation of the E-intermediate, the net protonation of the enzyme was found to increase by 1.0 H as compared to the O state (pH 7). Apart from the hydroxide ion bound to the binuclear site, which was calculated to become fully protonated, no other residues contribute significantly to the overall change in protonation. The hydroxide becoming protonated to water could be important for the function of the enzyme in that it would raise the redox potential of heme a3, thereby speeding up the heme-heme electron transfer. Verkhovsky et al. (1995) have found that this electron transfer reaction is controlled by proton uptake and proposed a protonatable site very close to the binuclear center whose protonation triggers the electron transfer. The hydroxide ligand appears to be a likely candidate. Furthermore, its protonation would allow the newly formed water molecule to dissociate from the reduced binuclear site, thus allowing oxygen to bind. Further reduction of the binuclear center (i.e., formation of the R state) was calculated to be associated with an increase in the average protonation of LysII-191 and GluII-78 by 0.58 and 0.23 H , respectively, which mainly contribute to an overall proton uptake of 0.8 H (compared to the E state). Before uptake of the third electron, oxygen reversibly binds to the binuclear site, forming the so-called compound

A (Chance et al., 1975). Electron transfer within the binuclear center leads to formation of the peroxy intermediate P, and subsequent electron input via CuA, and heme a then produces compound P1. The latter reaction is thermodynamically irreversible and traps the oxygen within the binuclear site (Verkhovsky et al., 1994). Recently Verkhovsky et al. (1996) have shown that it is the heme-to-heme transfer of the third electron that is essential for oxygen trapping to occur. As its structure is yet unknown, the P state (Fig. 1) was not treated explicitly in our calculations. From the electrostatic point of view, it is very similar to the R and A states in that the charge at the binuclear center is the same. Control calculations yielded essentially the same results for the R and A states and a model of the P state as shown in Fig. 1. As depicted in Fig. 2 b, the side chain of His325 was modeled in two different orientations: one is that of a CuB ligand, and the other one has the imidazole ring pointing away from the copper and forming hydrogen bonds with the

formyl group of heme a3, the hydroxyl group of Tyr328, and the backbone carbonyl group of Phe340. Conversion from the first to the second form could occur upon reduction of CuB and simultaneous stabilization of the nonbound histidine through protonation, as has been observed for the blue copper protein plastocyanin at low pH (Guss et al., 1986). Thus, starting from the E state (i.e., the one-electron reduced state with cuprous CuB), the alternative orientation of His325 was included in a parallel series of calculations. Its intrinsic pK was calculated as 4.4, arising from a desolvation penalty of 11.3 and a polar interaction energy of 9.1 pK units. The latter is mainly due to the strong interaction with the heme a3 formyl group ( 4.6 pK units) and the backbone carbonyl groups of residues 336 ­341 (together 4.7 pK units). Nevertheless, in both the one-electron and the two-electron reduced enzyme, His325 was calculated to remain neutral between pH 4 and pH 11.5, and no significant differences in the protonation of other residues were found.

However, upon uptake of the third electron and transfer to the binuclear center, i.e., formation of the P1 state, His325 was calculated to become protonated (0.9 H at pH 7.0), and thus the major contributor to a net proton uptake of 1.1 H , compared to the two-electron reduced state (cf. Table 2). With the histidine in its CuB-bound orientation, a net increase in protonation of 0.7 H was calculated, with LysII-191 ( 0.29 H ), GluII-78 ( 0.19 H ) and the coupled groups Asp399/Pra a3 ( 0.05 H ) becoming more protonated. Thus, because reduction of heme a was calculated to be associated with the uptake of 0.8 H , the heme-heme electron transfer did not cause a significant change in net protonation. After the reduction of oxygen and the formation of a water molecule, the oxoferryl or F state is formed. Electrostatically, it strongly resembles the E state, with the heme a3 being reduced, and hence the protonation state of the enzyme was found to be very similar. The change in net protonation (compared to the O state) was calculated as 1.0 H , with the proton uptake being solely due to the hydroxide ion bound to the binuclear center. To complete the reaction cycle, a fourth electron is transferred to the binuclear site (to form a redox state that is electrostatically similar to the R or A state of the enzyme), upon which the oxoferryl species is reduced and the binuclear site returns to its fully oxidized state. This might occur through a hydroxy intermediate H (Han et al., 1990; Fig. 1) with the hydroxide bound to the heme a3 iron. The OH could then be transferred to CuB, restoring the O state of the enzyme. The pH dependence of the net proton uptake by the enzyme upon reduction of the binuclear site is depicted in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the overall proton stochiometry is remarkably independent of pH, remaining at 0.2 H of the average value between pH 4 and 9 (Fig. 5 a). Above pH 9, however, the number of accepted protons decreases dramatically. Up to the formation of the R state, the calculated change in net protonation over the whole range of pH is nearly exclusively due to proton uptake by LysII-191, GluII-78, and the hydroxide bound to CuB (Fig. 5 b). The former two residues also contribute to the net proton uptake upon formation of the P1 state (Fig. 5 c). However, if His325 in its nonbound orientation is included in the calculations, the bulk of the change in net protonation is due to His325 (Fig. 5 d).
Influence of the hydroxide ligand

The ligand in its anionic form stabilizes the protonated states of nearby acidic and basic residues. Consequently, omitting the hydroxide caused the overall protonation of the protein to drop by 0.8 H . This is mainly due to proton release from Tyr280 ( 0.38 H , cf. Table 2). In addition, GluII-78, LysII-191, Asp477, and His85 were calculated to have lost between 0.03 and 0.07 H each. The finding of Tyr280 becoming partially deprotonated (pKa 7.6) is quite surprising, as all other tyrosine residues were determined to be neutral over the whole range of pH and for all redox states. Tyr280 strongly interacts with the binuclear site ( 8.3 and 8.2 pK units with heme a3 and CuB, respectively). However, these interactions were partially compensated ( 8.6 pK units) when the hydroxide ligand was included, causing the Tyr280, like all other tyrosines, to remain neutral. Thus there were no chargecharge interactions with other residues, and the pKa was equal to pKint (29.1). When the hydroxide ligand had been included in the calculations, it was found to become fully protonated to water upon reduction of either heme a3 or CuB. This also means, however, that charge-charge interactions with nearby residues are abolished. Thus, from the one-electron reduced state up to the regeneration of the O state upon which the catalytic cycle is completed, this water should have no influence on the average protonation of other residues and, indeed, no differences were found when the water was omitted. Upon formation of the E state, 0.8 H were calculated to be taken up, with Tyr280 becoming fully protonated. Hence, with the exception of the O state, results shown in Table 2 are also valid for the case in which the water molecule was not included.
Influence of the membrane model

We have seen that protonation of the hydroxide ion liganding CuB accounts for most of the change in net protonation calculated to occur upon partial reduction of the binuclear center. This raises the questions of how the hydroxide ion influences the average protonation of nearby residues in the fully oxidized state and whether the proton uptake upon electron transfer to the binuclear site can be accounted for by other residues when the hydroxide is not present. To address these questions, we have performed an additional series of calculations, omitting the hydroxide ion.

As described in the Methods section, we have introduced a membrane model to account for the low-dielectric environment at the parts of the molecular surface that are exposed to the hydrophobic regions of the membrane. Consequently, this resulted in a marked increase in desolvation penalty for residues exposed to or close to the now membrane-covered part of the surface. His464, for example, is relatively close to the protein-solvent interface when no membrane model is used. Upon introduction of the membrane model, however, the residue becomes deeply buried within the low dielectric, and thus the desolvation penalty increases to 11.6 pK units. Without the membrane model, the isoelectric point of the protein complex was calculated as 4.7 for the two-subunit enzyme in its fully oxidized state, which is only marginally different from the value of 4.6 calculated for the enzyme with the membrane model. Sixteen residues of subunits I and II were found to change their average protonation by more than 0.1 H at at least one pH value between 4 and 11.5 when the membrane model was omitted. A drastic change, for example, was calculated for Arg129; its pKa dropped by more than 5 pK units from above 11.5 to 6.5.

The side chain of this residue is very close to the proteinsolvent (or protein-membrane) interface; thus the decrease in pKa arises from a desolvation penalty that is 5.8 pK units lower without the membrane model. However, leaving out the membrane model did not significantly alter the stochiometry of the protonation changes that occur upon electron transfer. Residues that were calculated to change their protonation upon reduction of the cofactors were the same with or without the membrane model, and their individual changes in average protonation were not found to be significantly different. As control calculations have shown, including subunits III and IV (Iwata et al., 1995) in the calculations did not lead to an increase in the number of sites that strongly interact with the cofactors; nor does it significantly affect the proton stochiometry and the sites that were calculated to be involved in proton uptake.

DISCUSSION We have used a continuum dielectric model and finitedifference technique to analyze the electrostatic coupling between protonatable residues and cofactors of P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase. We have determined the average protonation of all titratable residues through Monte Carlo sampling and analyzed changes in protonation that occur upon reduction of the redox-active sites. One of the main results of our study is the identification and characterization of a core of titratable residues that strongly electrostatically interact with the redox centers and account for most of the protonation changes coupled to electron transfer. Similar cores or clusters of interacting protonatable residues as the result of computational analyses have been reported for the photosynthetic reaction centers of Rps. viridis (Lancaster et al., 1996) and Rb. sphaeroides (Beroza et al., 1995; Gunner and Honig, 1992). However, using the same threshold criterion for "strong" interactions, the cluster determined for the Rps. viridis reaction center comprised 47 protonatable groups, compared to only 18 residues that strongly interact with the cofactors in cytochrome c oxidase. Plainly, this is due to the limited number of titratable residues within the transmembranous part of cytochrome c oxidase close enough to the cofactors or each other to build up such a large "network" of interacting residues. The strong coupling of residues within such a core has consequences for the estimated error of the calculations. Whereas in isolated titration sites the region of fractional protonation is limited to a small pH range, it can be expected to extend over a wider range of the pH within a cluster of interacting residues. Thus it is easier to estimate the net protonation within this pH range, but it is more difficult to determine how this protonation is distributed over the coupled residues (Lancaster et al., 1996). Therefore, care must be taken in assigning protonation changes to individual groups within such a cluster, because even subtle

conformational changes within the cluster may cause a redistribution of protons over the cluster without, however, affecting the net protonation of the cluster. We have included a nonredox active magnesium ion in our calculations, the potential role of which in catalysis is still unclear. The calculations showed that, although the positive charge of the magnesium is effectively screened by the negative charges on the ligands Asp404 and GluII-218, it is important in defining the local electrostatics and thus in determining the distribution of protons among the residues of the core cluster. One could also speculate about its role in making Asp404 and GluII-218 effectively nonprotonatable, thereby preventing, for example, proton uptake from the periplasm. According to our calculations, electron input into the enzyme is counterbalanced by an increase in net protonation by 0.7­1.1 H /e , two-electron reduction of the binuclear center being coupled to uptake of 1.8 H , and input of a third electron to either heme a or the binuclear site being associated with additional 0.7­1.1 H . These results are in good agreement with the experimentally determined values reported by Rich and co-workers for bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (Mitchell et al., 1992; Mitchell and Rich, 1994; summarized in Rich et al., 1996). They showed that reduction of the enzyme is coupled to uptake of 2.4 H in the pH range 7.2­ 8.5, two of which were associated with the binuclear center, and the remaining 0.4 H with heme a/CuA, probably with the heme, as the Em of CuA is pHindependent (Blair et al., 1986). Similar values, also for the bovine heart enzyme, were obtained by Hallen and Nilsson ´ (1992), who determined 2.6 H (pH 7) to be taken up upon reduction, and recently by Capitanio et al. (1997), who, at pH 7 observed uptake of 2.1 H upon reduction, 0.7 of which they associated with heme a. Thus our computational results are within the error margins of the experimentally determined values. The proton uptake was calculated to be relatively independent of the pH up to pH 8.5 (Fig. 5). This agrees well with the experimental results by Hallen and Nilsson (1992) ´ and Mitchell and Rich (1994), who found only slight alterations in the value of proton uptake in the pH ranges 6 ­ 8.5 and 7.2­ 8.5, respectively. In contrast, Capitanio et al. (1997) observed a marked increase in proton uptake from 1 H at pH 6 to a maximum of 2.7 H at pH 8.5. Redox-coupled proton uptake was calculated to be mostly confined to residues close to the cofactor being reduced, hence stabilizing its less positively charged (i.e., reduced) state. This could be of importance for the control of the electron transfer process itself, because acceptance of an electron by a metal center within a low-dielectric environment is energetically very unfavorable and cannot be met sufficiently by redistribution of local charges. Thus the reduced state must to be further stabilized, either by delocalization of the electron (e.g., over a conjugated system such as the heme macrocycle) or by simultaneous uptake of a proton or other cation that binds close to the redox center (as outlined by Rich, 1996). Such a proton-controlled pro-

cess has been proposed by Verkhovsky et al. (1995) for the initial heme a­ heme a3 electron transfer reaction. They suggested that electron transfer, despite being very fast, is limited by the initially low midpoint potential of heme a3. Protonation of a site near the binuclear center, however, then raises the midpoint potential of the heme and the reduced population is stabilized. Interestingly, it is the hydroxide ligand that we have calculated to become protonated upon partial reduction of the binuclear center and which thus appears a likely candidate for the titratable group suggested by Verkhovsky et al. Furthermore, upon becoming protonated to water, it can dissociate from the binuclear site, thereby making way for the oxygen to bind. It has also ¨ been shown by Adelroth et al. (1995, 1996) and Hallen et al. ´ (1994) that electron transfer to heme a3 is coupled to protonation of a group close to the binuclear site, and it has been speculated that a hydroxide ligand to CuB could be the proton-binding group (Hallen et al., 1994). ´ Uptake of an additional proton, leading to the formation of the A-state (Fig. 1), was calculated to be accompanied by protonation of residues LysII-191 and GluII-78. Hence these groups, with the likely exception of GluII-78, may provide the "proton trap" (Rich, 1995; Wikstrom et al., 1994) that ¨ accounts for charge compensation but is physically sepa-

rated from the oxygen chemistry. However, it should again be stressed that, with the exception of cases such as the CuB-bound hydroxide ion, which was calculated to take up 1 H at all pH values upon partial reduction of the binuclear site, the assignment of the protonation change to individual sites within the strongly interacting cluster is problematic. Slightly differing sets of coordinates, e.g., from different states of the structural refinement, will yield different proton uptake profiles for some residues within the cluster without, however, affecting its net protonation (when using a slightly lower-resolution set of coordinates, for example, we calculated the coupled groups Asp399/Pra a3 to become protonated instead of LysII-191). The finding that GluII-78 changes its protonation state upon electron transfer to the binuclear center is quite surprising, as the residue is located some 25 Å away from the binuclear site (Fig. 6). Its titration curve was calculated to be relatively steep between pH 4.5 (92% protonation) and pH 8.5 (8% protonation). Thus, even a small shift in pK could give rise to a significant change in average protonation. In the case of GluII-78, this change in protonation was a result of direct interactions with heme a3 (0.65 pK units) and CuB (0.55 pK units) and not propagated by changes in protonation of intervening residues. (The only strong inter-

action with a potentially charged group was that with Lys354 (2.6 pK units), which, however, was calculated to be neutral in all redox states.) However, as for such an apparently electrostatically isolated site, the average protonation is very sensitive to changes in, for example, desolvation energy or polar interactions, the actual value of the proton uptake is difficult to assess. Nevertheless, such isolated groups close to the cytoplasmic side may be crucial as possible proton entry sites, because they can respond to electronic changes despite being very far away from the redox centers. Asp124, for example, is such a group and has been shown to be a key residue for proton pumping (Thomas et al., 1993; Garcia-Horsman et al., 1995; see below). GluII-78, like Asp124, is conserved among terminal hemecopper oxidases, and its location within the membrane is comparable to that of the aspartate (cf. Fig. 6). Thus it may be of importance for controlling the proton uptake, possibly through interactions with the so-called K-channel (see below) via the also conserved ThrII-82. An additional matter of debate is the nature of the "switch" that couples reduction of the oxygen to proton translocation, but at the same time prevents proton backflow into the cytoplasm. Within the framework of the histidinecycle concept (Wikstrom et al., 1994), His325, cycling be¨ tween two different orientations, has been suggested to provide this "switch," by moving away from CuB and becoming doubly protonated, with its positive charge stabilized electrostatically by the electrons taken up by the binuclear center (Iwata et al., 1995). The results of our calculations are in general agreement with this proposal. However, as we have calculated His325 to become doubly protonated only upon formation of the P1 state, they differ from the model suggested by Iwata et al. (1995), in which the histidine moves away from the copper already upon reduction of the binuclear site. Proton transfer pathways In the crystal structure of the P. denitrificans cytochrome c oxidase, two possible proton pathways have been identified (Iwata et al., 1995). The shorter one, which is also referred to as the K-pathway, leads to the binuclear site via the highly conserved residues Lys354, Thr351, and Tyr280, and has been discussed as the pathway for "chemical" protons that are required for water formation. The second, longer pathway (D-pathway) involves, in addition to a number of polar residues, the two titratable residues Asp124 and Glu278, which are also highly conserved among terminal hemecopper oxidases. On the grounds of site-directed mutagenesis studies (Thomas et al., 1993; Garcia-Horsman et al., 1995), in which the mutation of the aspartate to an asparagine led to an enzyme that, although incapable of proton pumping, was still able to reduce oxygen (albeit with a lower activity), the D-pathway has been proposed as the pathway for the "pumped" protons. From the characterization of other site-directed mutants (Konstantinov et al., 1997; Vygodina et al., 1996; Hosler et

al., 1996; Svensson-Ek et al., 1996; Verkhovskaya et al., 1997) it now seems to be clear that the three protonatable amino acids Lys354, Asp124, and Glu278 are indeed key residues for proton transfer to the binuclear center. Interestingly, charge translocation studies (Konstantinov et al., 1997) and the finding that mutation of Lys354 inhibits reduction of heme a3 (Hosler et al., 1996) suggest that the lysine and hence the K-pathway are of importance only for the eu-oxidase part of the catalytic cycle, i.e., the O3 R transitions but do not seem to be crucial for the P3 O part of the cycle. On the other hand, mutation of the D-pathway residues was found to completely abolish proton translocation associated with the peroxidase part, i.e., the P3 O transition. Thus the two pathways seem to be important for different halves of the catalytic cycle rather than for chemical or pumped protons. One could speculate that the bound oxygen molecule blocks further proton uptake along the K-pathway, e.g., through interactions with Tyr280. Alternatively, blocking of the pathway may occur through subtle conformational changes in the binuclear center caused by reduction and/or the associated protonation. In this study, both Glu278 and Lys354 were calculated to be neutral at pH 7.0 for all redox states considered. This is mainly a result of the high degree of desolvation and the resulting loss of reaction field energy that is not compensated for by polar or charge-charge interactions. Furthermore, the side chains of both residues point into large cavities that might contain ordered solvent molecules. In our calculations, such water-filled cavities were treated as a high-dielectric continuum. However, as the charge-stabilizing effect of highly directed hydrogen bonds cannot be accounted for (see Methods section), this approach consequently yields higher pKa values for acidic and lower pKa values for basic residues (Yang et al., 1993). Furthermore, protonation changes due to proton transfer are transient, i.e., residues that participate in proton transfer are not necessarily differently protonated in different equilibrium states. As part of a "proton wire," for example, the residue considered could well donate a proton to stabilize the reduced state of a cofactor. However, if the pKa of the residue is high enough, this would be followed immediately by proton uptake either from other residues or from the solvent, so that there is no change in average protonation. Hence the results of our (equilibrium) calculations are not necessarily inconsistent with both Glu278 and Lys354 having a key role in proton transfer to the binuclear center. In fact, recent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies indicate that Glu278 is protonated in the reduced enzyme (Puustinen et al., 1997) and might also be so in the oxidized state (Lubben and Gerwert, 1996). It has also been sug¨ gested by Puustinen et al. (1997) that a conformational change may be required for Glu278 to take part in proton transfer, which cannot be accounted for in our static computational model. Other, more general sources of error are the accuracy of the surfacing algorithm and the quality of the structure, i.e., the potential error of the coordinates used for the calcula-

tions. In some cases, long amino acid side chains are poorly defined in the electron density map at the present level of resolution. Moreover, structural refinement was done without assigning partial charges, and thus the actual positions of protonatable groups are in some cases not very well defined. However, even small differences in the position of single amino acid side chains can have a great influence on the outcome of the computational analysis, as discussed by Lancaster et al. (1996) for the bacterial reaction center. Hence, higher resolution structural information will be needed to further improve the reliability of the computational analysis and to assess the significance of the results reported here.

CONCLUSION Electrostatic calculations provide a valuable tool to analyze the response of titratable residues to changes in redox state. The work presented in this study can help to elucidate how electron transfer in cytochrome c oxidase is coupled to proton translocation, and which particular residues possibly contribute to protonation changes associated with reduction of cofactors. We have characterized a cluster of strongly interacting titratable groups that accounts for most of the protonation changes linked to electron transfer. The overall stoichiometry of these protonation changes is in good agreement with reported experimental values. Special consideration has been given to the groups that were calculated to accept or release protons upon reduction of the binuclear center. A hydroxide ligand to CuB was calculated to become protonated to water upon electron transfer to the binuclear site and could thus be important in both triggering heme-heme electron transfer and allowing oxygen binding. Within the limits of the computational model and the available structural information, results presented here can be useful for the design of new experiments to further evaluate the mechanism of coupling of electron transfer and proton translocation and the role of individual amino acid residues within this complex process.
