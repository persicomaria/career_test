Colicin N is a pore-forming bacteriocin that enters target Escherichia coli cells with the assistance of TolA, a protein in the periplasm of the target cell. The N-terminal domain of the colicin that carries the TolA-binding epitope, the translocation domain (T-domain), is intrinsically disordered. From 1 H­13C­15N NMR studies of isotopically labeled T-domain interacting with unlabeled TolAIII (the C-terminal domain of TolA), we have identified the TolA-binding epitope and have shown that the extent of its disorder is reduced on binding TolA, although it does not fold into a globular structure with defined secondary structure elements. Residues upstream and downstream of the 27-residue TolA-binding epitope remain disordered in the TolA-bound T-domain as they are in the free T-domain. Filamentous phage also exploits TolAIII to enter target cells, with TolAIII retaining its main secondary structure elements and global fold. In contrast to this, binding of the disordered T-domain of colicin A causes dramatic conformational changes in TolAIII marked by increased flexibility and lack of a rigid tertiary structure consistent with at least partial unfolding of TolAIII, suggesting that bacteriocins and bacteriophages parasitize E. coli using different modes of interaction with TolAIII. We have found that the colicin N T-domain­TolAIII interaction is strikingly similar to the previously described g3p­TolAIII interaction. The fact that both colicin N and filamentous phage exploit TolAIII in a similar manner, with one being a bacterial intrinsically disordered protein and the other being a viral structurally well-ordered protein, suggests that these represent a good example of convergent evolution at the molecular level.

Introduction
Colicins are plasmid-encoded save our soulsinduced protein antibiotics that kill susceptible cells competing with producing cells for nutrients by enzymatic cleavage of nucleic acids in the cytoplasm, pore formation in the inner membrane, or interference with peptidoglycan biosynthesis.1­3 Colicins have three domains that carry out key functions: recognizing an outer-membrane protein of the target cell that serves as the initial colicin*Corresponding author.

binding receptor (R-domain), translocating the colicin into the target cell [translocation domain (Tdomain)], and killing cells. The N-terminal regions of T-domains that have been characterized are intrinsically disordered and bind at least one member of the Ton or Tol protein families, leading to one of the classification systems by which colicins are divided into B-group colicins (colicins Ia, Ib, and B)4 and A-group colicins (colicins A, N, E1, and K),5 for Ton and Tol binders, respectively. At 43 kDa, colicin N is, by far, the smallest pore-forming colicin, and the structures of its receptor and pore-forming domains are well characterized6­8 (Fig. 1). A key step in the translocation mechanism for colicin N is its interaction with the Escherichia coli periplasmic protein TolA. This interaction involves a recognition sequence (residues 40­66) within the 90-residue Nterminal T-domain, termed the TolA binding box, that has been shown by CD, fluorescence, and NMR studies to be intrinsically disordered in solution,9

Colicin N­TolAIII Interaction

881 like colicins, consists of three domains.24 It is the Nterminal domain of g3p, its N1 domain, that interacts with TolAIII, triggering events leading to the infection of the bacterial cell.19 Although group A colicins and g3p both bind to TolAIII, using it as a common entry point, there is a fundamental difference between these invading proteins. As noted above, the N-terminal regions of the colicins interacting with TolAIII are intrinsically disordered, in contrast to the g3p N1 domain, which is globular, consisting of a short helix followed by five  strands arranged in a barrel-like motif.19 Given the increasing awareness of the importance of IDPs and the way they bind their partners, we have here a system of particular interest allowing us to compare directly the interactions of disordered and globular proteins that have both evolved to bind to the same partner. Previous studies have shown that TolAIII changes its conformation upon binding to g3p, but retains its global fold and main secondary structure elements.17,19 In contrast to this, an NMR investigation of the interaction between TolAIII and the disordered T-domain of colicin A revealed dramatic conformational changes in TolAIII marked by increased flexibility and lack of a rigid tertiary structure, suggesting that colicins and bacteriophages parasitize E. coli using different modes of interaction with TolAIII.18 These observations raise a fundamental question about the nature of invasive proteins: Do the differences reflect the fact that the consequences for the target cell after translocation of the colicin are fatal, while bacteriophages need the machinery of functional cells to multiply after genome import? To investigate whether the difference in the interaction of g3p and colicin A with TolAIII is a general feature of these phylogenetically and structurally different invading protein systems, we set about studying the structural characteristics of TolAIII upon binding the colicin N T-domain using NMR spectroscopy. The results demonstrate a mode of interaction different from that of colicin A and similar to that of g3p.

consistent with this region not being visible in X-ray electron density maps.6 Such intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) lack fixed three-dimensional (3D) structures under physiological conditions, existing instead as dynamic ensembles of interconverting conformers. IDPs are involved in important regulatory functions such as signal transduction,10 with many such proteins undergoing a disorder-toorder transition upon binding to their partner, a process termed induced folding.11­14 Induced folding can be associated with the formation of a compact globular structure, but it can also occur with less dramatic transitions that simply lead to a reduced conformational entropy of the intrinsically disordered region.15 Our preliminary NMR investigations have indicated that a colicin N T-domain peptide (T-dom40­76) incorporating the TolA binding box switches from a disordered state to an ordered state when bound to TolAIII.8 However, this earlier study used only 1H­15N NMR of the T-dom40­76 peptide, which did not allow resonances to be assigned. By using 1H­13C­15N NMR of the fulllength T-domain and the T-dom40­76 peptide, we have been able to sequentially assign resonances of the free16 and TolAIII-bound forms of these peptides (this work) to judge the extent and nature of the disorderto-order transition induced upon binding to the Cterminal domain of TolA, and we report these findings here together with the unexpected similarity of the colicin N­TolAIII interaction with the interaction that TolAIII undergoes with a structured region (N1 domain) of the filamentous phage g3p protein.17­19 TolA spans the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria, where it helps maintain membrane integrity20 and has energy-dependent conformational changes.21 Its N-terminal domain, TolAI, is anchored in the inner membrane with the  10-kDa C-terminal / TolAIII domain attached to an extended stalk (TolAII) that places TolAIII close to the inner surface of the outer membrane.22 How colicin N traverses the outer membrane to deliver its pore-forming domain to the inner membrane is not known in detail, but the TolAIII interaction with the T-domain is essential for this to happen.23 It is not only the disordered N-terminal domains of group A colicins, such as colicin N and colicin A, that use TolAIII to enter their host, filamentous phages also interact with TolAIII in order to inject their genome into the bacterial cytoplasm via their g3p protein. g3p is located at one end of the phage particle and,

Results and Discussion
Only the TolA binding box of the colicin N T-domain is affected by TolAIII binding It is known that the first 90 residues of the Tdomain of colicin N are important in helping it cross the outer membrane of its bacterial target cell, specifically the 27 consecutive residues forming the TolA binding box.7 Previous two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments using a 15 N-labeled peptide containing these residues (T-dom40­76) suggested that at least the region of the TolA binding box is affected by TolAIII binding.8 To determine whether other regions of the colicin T-domain are involved in the interaction and also to determine the nature of the TolAIII-induced structural transition of the Tdomain, 3D NMR experiments using a doublelabeled sample of the full-length T-domain in

883 sidues 40­76 of the colicin N T-domain (T-dom40­76) has been shown previously to bind TolAIII with a slightly lower affinity than the full-length Tdomain, 8 in good agreement with the results presented here indicating that resonances of residues upstream and downstream of this region are unaffected by the presence of TolAIII. The chemical shifts of the assigned resonances of T-dom40­76 and the corresponding residues of the 90-residue Tdomain construct are virtually the same (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2a), indicating that the regions upstream and downstream of residues 40­ 76 do not interfere with it. Because the interaction between TolAIII and the colicin N T-domain depends solely on the region in between residues 40 and 76, we set about repeating the TolAIII­T-domain titration using 13C/15N-labeled T-dom40­76 instead of the 90-residue T-domain. By doing so, we wanted to circumvent the above mentioned problems when we were trying to assign the shifted resonances of the Tdomain upon complex formation. Figure 2b shows the 1H­15N HSQC spectrum of T-dom40­76 (black) and of T-dom40­76 in complex with TolAIII (red). As in the experiment using the 90-residue T-domain construct (Fig. 2a), the greater hydrogen chemical shift dispersion of the TolAIII-bound form of Tdom40­76 suggests that binding is accompanied by a structural transition to a less disordered form of the T-domain peptide in the complex. The smaller construct used in this experiment and the fact that most of the residues that are still disordered after complex formation are not present in this construct made it possible to achieve a more complete assignment from triple-resonance experiments using the smaller T-dom40­76 construct. Except for five residues (Trp46, Asn53, Ser58, His67, and Gly68), all of the expected backbone resonances of T-dom40­76 in complex with TolAIII could be assigned unambiguously, giving us a more detailed picture of the structural transition that occurs upon complex formation. The chemical shifts of the assigned resonances of the nine TolAIII-binding residues of the 90-residue T-domain construct are virtually the same as those of the corresponding residues of Tdom40­76 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2b), showing again that T-dom40­76 is a suitable construct for defining the colicin­TolAIII complex. Our results (Fig. 2) confirm the identity of the binding region suggested by Gokce et al. using site-directed mutagenesis and furthermore show that this region is the only region of the T-domain affected upon inter-

complex with unlabeled TolAIII were carried out in this work, exploiting the assignment of backbone NH resonances of this intrinsically disordered domain that we have recently reported.16 The colicin N T-domain binds TolAIII with a Kd of 1 M,23 and such an interaction is expected to cause changes in the magnetic environment of the nuclei that are situated at the molecular interface of the binding partners, inducing chemical shift variations of the corresponding signals. As expected, titration of unlabeled TolAIII into 13C/15N-labeled colicin N Tdomain caused a significant alteration in the 2D 1 H­15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum (Fig. 2a). About two-thirds of the signals visible in the spectrum are unaffected by the addition of unlabeled TolAIII, indicating that their residues neither are involved in the molecular interface of the complex nor experience any structural rearrangements upon binding. The other resonances, however, are not visible in the spectrum of Fig. 2a, although they are visible at a lower vertical scale of the same spectrum with a different apparent intensity and a different chemical shift (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). The altered proton chemical shifts, in particular, suggest that the residues affected by TolAIII are no longer in a disordered state, consistent with previous studies showing an entropy change measured by calorimetry indicative of folding of the T-domain during binding.23,25 We failed to identify all 85 expected backbone NH resonances of the TolAIII-bound form of the colicin N T-domain using triple-resonance experiments, in contrast to our earlier study of the free form of the T-domain.16 Twenty-four NH resonances of the TolAIII-bound form of the colicin N T-domain are unassigned, all of them from residues between 40 and 73, including the TolA binding box (residues 40­66). However, nine of the residues in the TolA binding box (Ser45, Asn48, Lys52, Asp54, His57, Asp59, Tyr62, Ile64, and Phe66) could be assigned (see Materials and Methods), and these show very strong chemical shift perturbations upon TolAIII binding when compared to the residues that reside outside the TolA binding box (Fig. 2a). A complete assignment of all shifted resonances of the TolA binding box of the full-length T-domain peptide has not been possible because the residues that are in complex with TolAIII give rise to very broad signals compared to the very sharp signals that arise from the residues that do not interact with TolAIII and are therefore still in a disordered state. A construct comprising only re-

885 used our C and C chemical shifts as inputs for an approach developed by Marsh et al. that combines different chemical shifts into a single residue-specific secondary structure propensity (SSP) score.31 The SSP score gives the percentages of  and  structures on a per-residue basis, with a score of 1 indicating a fully formed  structure and with a score of - 1 indicating a fully formed  structure. A score of 0.5 would indicate that 50% of conformers in the disordered state ensemble are helical at a given position. Figure 3c shows the SSP score for Tdom40­76 in the free (left) and TolAIII-bound (right) states. As with the C CSI values, the SSP score of the TolAIII-bound form of T-dom40­76 is indicative of reduced random coil characteristics compared with the unbound form of T-dom40­76, with residues S45S47 and S61-F66 having SSP scores consistent with structure propensity. In addition, there is a region between residues 51 and 58 that has an SSP score indicative of -helical propensity. To investigate further whether secondary structure is formed in T-dom40­76 on binding to TolAIII, we measured 3JHN coupling constants from HNHA spectra (Materials and Methods). Figure 3b shows the coupling constants for the free (left) and TolAIIIbound (right) forms of T-dom40­76. For  helices, the mean 3JHN coupling constant is 4.8 Hz, as predicted from the population of torsion angles in a database of 85 high-resolution protein structures, 29 and 3.9 Hz, as calculated from an idealized  angle for a regular helix.28 For  structure, the mean 3JHN coupling constant would be 8.5 Hz, 8.9 Hz, and 9.7 Hz for idealized anti-parallel and parallel  strands, respectively. Thirty-three 3JHN coupling constants values could be determined for the free form of T-dom40­76; consistent with the disordered state of T-dom40­76, there are no regions within this peptide that show 3JHN coupling constants that would be expected for regions of persistent secondary structure (Fig. 3b, left). Due to partial overlap and weaker signals of the TolAIII-bound form of Tdom40­76, only 22 3JHN coupling constants could be determined (Fig. 3b, right). However, like the aforementioned CSI and TALOS analyses, the 3 JHN coupling constants for the bound form of Tdom40­76 (Fig. 3b, left) suggest no general folding into a distinctive structure containing well-defined secondary structure elements. Nevertheless, 3JHN coupling constants for residues 51, 52, and 55 are considerably more negative than those of the unbound form of T-dom40­76 (Fig. 3c, right). As these residues are in the region with an SSP score indicative of  structure, it is possible that this stretch of amino acids adopts a degree of helical structure upon binding to TolAIII. For the region between residues S61 and F66 that has been suggested by the chemical shift analyses above to adopt a  structure after binding to TolAIII, only two 3JHN coupling constants could be deduced, with Y62 having the same value in the free and bound forms and with I64 showing a considerably increased 3JHN coupling constant after binding to TolAIII (Fig. 3c, right). As the terminal residues of

Structural transition of colicin N T-domain upon binding TolAIII Having assigned almost all resonances that are affected by the T-domain binding to its target TolAIII using triple-resonance experiments, it is now possible to investigate the nature of the structural transition accompanying binding from perturbations of the chemical shifts of C and C nuclei. These are indicative of the state of secondary structure of the observed polypeptide,26 with helical conformations identified by sequential and continuous upfield-shifted C resonances and downfieldshifted C resonances and with sheet conformations identified by downfield-shifted C resonances and upfield-shifted C resonances. Figure 3a shows the C and C chemical shift indices (CSIs) derived from their chemical shift differences from corresponding types of amino acids in a random coil conformation26 (the absolute secondary chemical shifts are included in Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). No stretch of more than two consecutive residues, with chemical shifts indicative of secondary structure, could be identified for the unbound form of Tdom40­76 (Fig. 3a, left), consistent with this peptide having a far-UV CD spectrum indicative of an unfolded protein and no near-UV CD signal,9 as expected for a peptide being in a disordered conformation. The change in CSI that occurs in Tdom40­76 after binding TolAIII is depicted in Fig. 3a (right). Although, in particular, the C CSI values are indicative of reduced random coil characteristics compared with the unbound form of T-dom40­76, general folding into a distinctive structure containing well-defined secondary structure elements, as described for many other IDPs upon binding,30 does not occur. Only residues S45, W46, and S47 and residues I64, T65, and F66 form stretches of more than two consecutive residues with indicative secondary structure, in these cases -structure. We also used the backbone chemical shifts (C, C, CO, and N) of the unbound T-domain and T-dom40­76 bound to TolAIII as input for the program TALOS.27 TALOS uses residue triplets of these chemical shifts to search a database for similar shifts to create dihedral angles for backbone residues. It also judges whether the prediction is in good agreement with database values. There were no more than two consecutive residues of free T-dom40­76 with good prediction, but there was a run of six consecutive residues (S61, Y62, H63, I64, T65, and F66) with good prediction for TolAIII-bound T-dom40­76. The dihedral angles for these six residues all show up in the -region of the Ramachandran plot (highlighted in yellow in Fig. 3a), consistent with the consensus CSI for residues I64, T65, and F66 indicative of a sheet conformation after binding to TolAIII. We also

secondary structure elements often show irregular torsion angles31 and as the region between S61 and F66 is a short stretch of possible  structure with I64 being the only central residue of this stretch from which a coupling constant could be deduced, it is not possible to definitely confirm the existence of  structure by the analysis of 3JHN coupling constants carried out here. Interestingly, the only stretch of the unbound Tdomain that is predicted by APSSP2, SCRATCH, and Jpred 332 to reside in a secondary structure conformation consists of residues Y62, H63, I64, T65, F66, and H67, and these are the residues suggested by chemical-shift-based analyses (CSI, TALOS, and SSP) to be in a -conformation. Thus, it is plausible to suggest that the sequential region between residues S61 and H67 (SYHITH) folds into a -conformation upon binding TolAIII, and that this conformation is already predetermined in its sequence. This is striking because it is reported that a four-aminoacid sequence in PAL has been shown to be involved in its interaction with TolAIII.33 A similar motif is also present in the sequence of two other TolAIIIbinding partners, g3p and colicin A. The motifs are YGT for g3p, SYGK for PAL, and SYNT for colicin A; in the case of g3p and PAL, these motifs are found in -conformations.34 All of these motifs contain a central tyrosine residue, and it is known that a mutation of this residue in colicin N (Y62) completely

abolishes binding to TolAIII23 and reduces intramolecular binding (which we have termed self-recognition) and, hence, protection from proteolytic degradation.16 If the S61-H67 region of the colicin N T-domain does adopt a -conformation on binding TolAIII, it may be an example of the recently described -strand addition mechanism,35 where unstructured peptide stretches (`linear motifs') add a -strand onto a -sheet or a -strand in its receptor protein. -Strand additions have been seen in promiscuous protein­protein contacts; in the present case, this would be in line with our finding that the region between residues S61 and H67 also plays a role in the aforementioned self-recognition event for colicin N.16 TolAIII changes its conformation upon binding to colicin N but retains its global fold TolA plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the cell envelope, providing communication between the inner and the outer membranes via its anchor in the inner membrane and its interactions with other proteins, including the outermembrane-anchored PAL33 and the periplasmic TolB.36,37 In vitro, although g3p binding to TolAIII induces conformational changes in it, TolAIII still retains its globular fold and secondary structure elements.17,19 The colicin A T-domain, on the other

Colicin N­TolAIII Interaction

887 shifts and the SSP score of the free (Fig. 5a) and colicin N T-domain-bound forms (Fig. 5b) of TolAIII confirms that this is also the case when the T-domain binds TolAIII. We furthermore examined which regions of TolAIII are protected from amide-H/D exchange after dissolving the free and T-domainbound forms in 100% D2O and found that the residues that are protected from H/D exchange reside in the same regions of TolAIIII (Fig. 5a and b, left). As amide protons are mainly protected against deuterium exchange if they reside in secondary structure elements, this finding confirms that the TolAIII secondary structure elements are conserved after T-domain binding. Because we have used a TolAIII construct longer than that used by Deprez et al. (see the text above), we wanted to make sure that both TolAIII systems behave similarly.38 Apart from showing that the chemical shifts of the free TolAIII form are comparable to those reported elsewhere (see the text above), we also titrated unlabeled colicin A T-domain to our construct of 15N-labeled TolAIII and observed the same effect that was reported by Deprez et al. for their shorter construct, namely, that TolAIII resonances appear to be less dispersed. Performing an H/D exchange experiment using the colicin A T-domain-bound form of 15 N-labeled TolAIII resulted in complete loss of all TolAIII amide-proton resonances, unlike the case for the colicin N T-domain-bound form, suggesting that TolAIII is less structured when bound to the colicin A T-domain (Hecht, Zhang, James, and Moore, unpublished data). Figure 6 shows the NH chemical shift variations between the free and the colicin N T-domain-bound forms of TolAIII. Consistent with a structural rearrangement upon T-domain binding, chemical shift variations between the free and the bound forms of TolAIII were seen for the majority of the TolAIII amide resonances. The strongest chemical shift variations (N 0.55 ppm) were for residues F17, Y18, I32, L34, E46, A56, N79, A80, and F84. Residues I32 and L34, and residues N79, A80, and F84 are located in the regions of -strand 1 and -strand 3 (Fig. 6), respectively. Monitoring the chemical shift perturbations of TolAIII upon g3p binding shows that g3p binding also strongly affects residues within these regions,17 most likely due to the fact that these regions participate in the binding interface between TolAIII and g3p.19 L34, although part of the 1 strand, is not directly involved in the TolAIII­g3p binding interface (the interatomic distance in the g3p­TolAIII crystal structure is N4.5 Å), but nevertheless shows a large chemical shift variation. As Deprez et al. have also solved the solution structure of free TolAIII and compared it with the crystal structure of the TolAIII­g3p complex reported by Lubkowski et al.,19 they suggested that the g3pinduced chemical shift perturbation for L34 results from a ring current effect of Y74, whose aromatic ring moves toward L34 upon g3p binding.17 Interestingly, we find that the same residue in TolAIII experiences a strong chemical shift perturbation upon binding the colicin N T-domain, suggesting

hand, induces conformational changes in TolAIII that are marked by increased flexibility and lack of a rigid tertiary structure. These findings led to the suggestion that bacteriocins and bacteriophages parasitize E. coli using different modes of TolAIII interaction.18 However, our work does not support a general model of colicin-induced unfolding of TolAIII, being more in line with what has been reported to be the effect of g3p binding to TolAIII. In this work, we used a 13C/15N-labeled sample of TolAII/III (residues 296­421 with an N-terminal purification tag having the sequence MH6S2, as described by Anderluh et al.9) and assigned the resonances using a classical set of triple-resonance experiments (see Materials and Methods). Our assignments are in agreement with those for a smaller TolAIII construct (residues 325­421) that have been reported elsewhere.38 The 1H­15N HSQC spectrum of free TolAIII showed less peaks than expected; after the resonance assignment, it became clear that the missing peaks belong to the Nterminal purification tag and residues 296­335 of the TolA296­421. This N-terminal stretch of residues is known to have dynamic properties, as residues 295­ 332 of TolAIII are not visible in the g3p­TolAIII crystal structure. Apart from these N-terminal residues and the resonances for K402, Q406, and K420, all expected backbone NH resonances were assigned unambiguously. The first residue that could be assigned following the flexible N-terminal stretch is residue D336, which we term below D1 so that the TolAIII sequence is numbered sequentially from D1 to P86. The sequential backbone assignment of TolAIII enabled us to investigate its behavior upon binding the T-domain of colicin N through complex formation between unlabeled T-domain and 13C/15Nlabeled TolAIII monitored by 1H­15N HSQC spectroscopy. Upon titration of the complex, which is in slow exchange on the NMR timescale (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4), almost all backbone NH resonances of TolAIII were shifted (Fig. 4). Chemical shift variations are usually observed for residues that are located at the interface of a protein complex; when they occur for residues outside the interface, they are an indicator of conformational change. Thus, our observation not only confirms that the Tdomain binds TolAIII but also confirms that this interaction leads to a structural rearrangement of TolAIII that appears to be similar to that reported by Deprez et al. for complex formation between 15Nlabeled TolAIII and unlabeled g3p.18 To further verify the effect of T-domain binding on TolAIII, we assigned the TolAIII backbone resonances of its Tdomain-bound form using triple-resonance experiments. All but six residues (K10, S11, A20, S21, S22, and S64) that could be assigned in the free TolAIII could also be assigned unambiguously in its colicin N T-domain-bound form. It has been reported that, despite the structural rearrangement that occurs in TolAIII upon g3p binding, its secondary structure elements are mainly conserved.17 Comparing the CSI of the C chemical

that movement of Y74 might be induced by Tdomain binding as well. Deprez et al. also reported that resonances of A20 and E46 had strong chemical shift perturbations upon g3p binding without being in the intermolecular binding interface. The structural comparison of the free TolAIII and its g3pbound form revealed that A20 was part of the flexible region between residues 16 and 25 that allowed movement of helix 1 with respect to the -sheet on

g3p binding. While we could not assign resonances of A20 in the T-domain-bound form of our TolAIII, we do note that, within this flexible region of our TolAIII, there are resonances from F17 and Y18 that are strongly affected by binding of the colicin N Tdomain, suggesting that a similar movement of helix 1 with respect to the -sheet follows colicin N binding. Deprez et al. also showed that the 3 strand of TolAIII extends when g3p binds to TolAIII, while

890 the bulge present in 2 (around residues 45 and 46) in free TolAIII disappears, and it was suggested that this explains the strong chemical shift perturbation of residue E46.17 Most strikingly, the same residue (E46) shows a strong chemical shift perturbation when the colicin N T-domain binds TolAIII. To further illustrate and assist a comparison of the regions of TolAIII most affected by its interaction with the colicin N T-domain and filamentous phage g3p protein, we have mapped chemical shift perturbations of more than 0.4 ppm and 0.55 ppm, introduced by either g3p17 or colicin N T-domain, respectively, onto the solution structure17 of free TolAIII (Fig. 7). This comparison illustrates that the same regions of TolAIII are affected upon binding either the structurally well-ordered g3p protein of filamentous phage or the intrinsically disordered T-domain of E. coli colicin N, suggesting not only that the binding sites for these structurally and phylogenetically different proteins are the same but also that the structural rearrangement of TolAIII resulting from the interaction of these two proteins is very similar.

Colicin N­TolAIII Interaction The plasmid encoding for the colicin N T-domain colicin E9 DNase fusion protein pOHN1 was produced by digesting plasmid pNP330 (encoding wild-type T1­61­ DNase fusion protein and Im9, with a histidine tag attached to Im9)43 with Nde and Nco to exchange the T1­61-domain of colicin E9 with the T-domain of colicin N. For this purpose, the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the colicin N T-domain was amplified from the full-length colicin N gene by PCR using 5-TTTTTCATATGATGGGTAGTAATGGCGCAG and 5-TTTTTCCATGGACGCTCCATCACCGTTATTA as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Both primers were purchased from Sigma. The resulting PCR product was cleaved with Nde and Nco and ligated into the pNP330 plasmid cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid encoded for the 91 N-terminal residues of colicin N fused to the DNase domain of colicin E9 noncovalently bound to histidinetagged Im9. The sequence of the fusion protein was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pOHN1, and isolation of the fusion protein from the His-tagged Im9 was performed essentially as previously described for preparation of colicin E9 and its DNase domain.44 Purified fusion protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) and exchanged into 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM PMSF and diluted in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 70% TFA. Fifteen microliters of 5 M CNBr solution was added to 1.1 ml of the 70% TFA solution, which was protected from light and allowed to incubate for 17 h at room temperature.45 After CNBr cleavage, the mixture was diluted in 20 ml of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM PMSF, followed by concentration and buffer exchange against 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 1 mM PMSF. Chromatography using a 5-ml HITRAPTM SP HP column (GE Healthcare) connected to an Akta Explorer liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare) then separated the products. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis (Shimadzu-Biotech) confirmed that the T-domain polypeptide had been obtained. Isotopically labeled samples were obtained from bacteria grown in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/l 15 NH4Cl as the only nitrogen source and, where appropriate, 4 g/l [13C6]glucose as the sole carbon source. Protein concentrations were determined from UV absorption at 280 nm with extinction coefficients as follows: colicin N T-domain, 12,660 M- 1 cm- 1; colicin N T-dom40­76, 12,660 M- 1 cm- 1; TolAIII, 5120 M- 1 cm- 1. NMR spectroscopy NMR spectra were acquired with Varian Unity Inova 500 or 600 spectrometers equipped with triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient probes, operating at 1H frequencies of 499.865 MHz and 599.162 MHz and 15N frequencies of 50.66 MHz and 60.72 MHz, respectively, using pulse sequences incorporated into the Varian (Palo Alto, CA, USA) Protein Pack suite of experiments. Resonance assignments of doubly labeled TolAIII (0.6 mM) were obtained from 2D 1H­15N HSQC, 3D CBCA(CO)NH, and 3D HN(CA)CO spectra at 27 °C. Unlabeled T-domain of colicin N was stepwise titrated into a sample of 15Nlabeled TolAIII (0.35 mM) to reach molar ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1, respectively, and the shift of resonances was followed by recording 2D 1H­15N HSQC spectra after each titration step. The thermostability of the final complex was determined by recording 2D 1 H­15 N

Concluding Remarks
TolAIII is exploited by the structurally / g3p protein to assist in the entry of filamentous phages into E. coli, as well as by the intrinsically disordered T-domain of colicin N. The interaction of an IDP with a folded protein scaffold, similarly to the interaction of an endogenous globular protein with the same scaffold protein, has been shown for the Tdomain of colicin E9 binding to the periplasmatic TolB protein of E. coli, which has no sequence or structural resemblance to TolA. The colicin E9 domain binds TolB, displacing the endogenous globular PAL protein by mimicking rearranged PAL residues and by preventing induced-fit changes in TolB.39,40 However, the similarities in TolAIII binding for the colicin N T-domain and g3p are striking in that both are exogenous proteins that bind TolAIII similarly to assist their entry into cells. The lack of any sequence or structural homology between the TolAIII binding sites of these very different proteins implies that they have evolved independently to fulfill the same biological task and, thus, they are an excellent example of convergent evolution at the molecular level.

Materials and Methods
Protein expression, purification, and sample preparation Colicin N T-domain comprising residues 40­76 (T-dom40­76) was expressed and purified as described by Evans et al.41 and Anderluh et al.,42 respectively. Samples of TolAIII comprising amino acids 296­421 of the TolA protein (Swiss-Prot accession number P19934) were produced as described previously9 using an E. coli BL21(DE3) expression system containing modified pET8c vector (Novagen), which adds an N-terminal purification tag with the sequence MH6S2.

Colicin N­TolAIII Interaction HSQC spectra at 15 °C, 27 °C, and 35 °C, respectively. Resonance assignments of doubly labeled TolAIII (0.8 mM) in complex with the unlabeled T-domain of colicin N (1.2 mM) were obtained from 2D 1H­15N HSQC, 3D CBCA(CO)NH, and 3D HN(CA)CO spectra at 35 °C. Prior to that, a 2D 1H­15N HSQC spectrum of TolAIII was recorded at 35 °C as reference. Amide-H/D exchange experiments were performed using a 300 M sample of 15 N-labeled TolAIII, a 300 M sample of 15N-labeled TolAIII in complex with the colicin A T-domain, and a 300 M sample of 15N-labeled TolAIII in complex with colicin T-dom40­76 at molecular ratios of 1:2 and 1:1.3, respectively. Before the recording of NMR spectra, samples were freeze-dried and afterwards dissolved in 100% D2O, followed by acquisition of 2D 1H­15N HSQC spectra. Resonance assignments of doubly labeled colicin N Tdomain (1.1 mM) were obtained from 2D 1H­15N HSQC, 3D CBCA(CO)NH, HN(CA)CO, HNCO, and HNN spectra at 15 °C.16 Resonance assignments of doubly labeled colicin N T-domain (1.1 mM) and colicin T-dom40­76 (1.2 mM) in complex with unlabeled TolAIII were obtained from 2D 1H­15N HSQC, 3D CBCA(CO)NH, HN(CA)CO, HNCO, and HNN spectra at 15 °C and 35 °C, respectively. Assignment of nine residues in the TolA binding box within full-length colicin N was achieved by overlaying well-desolved peaks in this spectrum at 35 °C with those assigned in the spectrum of colicin N T-dom40­76 bound to TolAIII at 35 °C. HNHA spectra were acquired to obtain the 3JHN coupling constants, using a Bruker Avance III 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient probe operating at a 1H frequency of 800.23 MHz, a 13C frequency of 201.23 MHz, and a 15N frequency of 81.09 MHz, using pulse sequences incorporated into the Bruker Topspin 2.1 software. Three-dimensional 1H­15N HNHA spectra of the free and TolAIIIbound forms of T-dom40­76 (1.5 mM) were recorded at 15 °C and 35 °C, respectively. The 1H carrier frequency was positioned at the resonance of water during the experiments. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe46 and analyzed in NMRView.47 Prior to Fourier transformation, a cosine-bell window function was applied to each dimension for apodization. Indirect dimensions were first linearpredicted to double the number of data points and then zero-filled to round up the number of data points to the nearest power of 2. 1H chemical shifts were referenced directly to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt, and the 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt.48 NMR experiments were acquired at 15 °C, 27 °C, and 35 °C, respectively. Chemical shift differences were calculated using the CSI module of NMRView.47 NH chemical shift variations were calculated using the formula: {(H)2 + (N/HN)2}2. SSP scores for the assigned N-terminal residues of TolBwt in complex with ColE9 T-domain were derived from their assigned C and C chemical shifts using the SSP software package. Accession numbers Chemical shifts have been deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank with accession numbers 16130, 16131, 16133, and 16134 for T-dom40­76 in complex with unlabeled TolAIII, T-dom40­76, TolAIII residues 296­421 in

complex with unlabeled colicin N T-domain, and TolAIII residues 296­421, respectively. The assigned 1H­15N HSQC spectra of the aforementioned constructs are furthermore shown as Figs. S5a, S5b, S5c, and S5d.
