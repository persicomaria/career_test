Introduction
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water-selective transport protein expressed in plasma membranes in glial cells throughout the central nervous system. At least three distinct roles of AQP4 in brain physiology have been demonstrated.1 AQP4 facilitates water movement into and out of the brain in a variety of pathological conditions, such as water intoxication, stroke, infection, tumor, and hydrocephalus,2­5 by facilitating osmotically driven water movement across barriers separating brain parenchyma and the blood and cerebrospinal fluid compartments. AQP4 increases the migration of glial cells in culture and in vivo models6,7 by a mechanism that likely involves facilitated water influx into lamellipodia at the

leading edge of migrating cells.8 AQP4 also modulates neuroexcitation phenomena, including seizure activity, cortical spreading depression, and visual, auditory, and olfactory signal transduction,9­13 by a mechanism that may involve altered extracellular space volume and potassium buffering.11,14 Recently, an interesting new role of AQP4 in facilitating cell­cell adhesion was proposed, based on structural data from two-dimensional crystals in which an extracellular helix­helix interaction (at residues 139­142) was predicted.15 The authors also reported increased clustering of L-cells following AQP4 transfection. Another study showed increased cell adhesion to various substrates when AQP4 was transfected into glioma cell lines. 16 There is also evidence that a related aquaporin, the major intrinsic protein of lens fiber (also called AQP0), facilitates adhesion of lens fiber cells in the eye.17,18 As reviewed recently,19 AQP4dependent cell­cell adhesion could be important in brain development, blood­brain barrier integrity, and osmosensing. However, arguing against this speculation is the absence of such abnormalities in transgenic mice lacking AQP4.1 Here, we tested the potential role of AQP4 in cell­ cell adhesion. We used primary glial cell cultures from wild-type versus AQP4 knockout mice and null

AQP4 Role in Cell Adhesion

1137 Cell aggregation was measured using a standard adhesion assay in which a cell suspension was stirred for specific times and the number of particles (cells + cell aggregates) was counted. Increased adhesion is seen as a reduction over time in the total number of particles. Figure 1b shows the number of L-cell particles at 30 and 60 min. There was a small reduction in particle counts with time, though not different between nontransfected, stably transfected, and AQP4 transiently transfected cells. Similar results were found in three sets of measurements on separate cell cultures. In the positive control, greatly increased adhesion (reduced particle count) was seen after L-cell transfection with Ecadherin. Figure 1c shows light micrographs of the L-cells after glutaraldehyde (to freeze aggregation state) and settling onto a cover glass. Little aggregation was seen in nontransfected and AQP4-expressing L-cells, whereas many aggregates were seen in the E-cadherin-expressing L-cells. Similar aggregation studies done twice using control versus AQP4 stably expressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Fisher rat thyroid cells (generated as previously described21,22) also showed no AQP4-dependent aggregation (data not shown).

versus AQP4-transfected L-cells, which lack endogenous adhesion molecules, and two other cell types in which transfection produces high levels of AQP4 expression. Utilizing established and novel assays of cell­cell adhesion, we found no evidence for AQP4facilitated adhesion. Our conclusion that AQP4 residues 139­142 are not involved in adhesion was further supported by binding measurements of a peptide containing the putative adhesion sequence.

Results
Initial adhesion studies were done using L-cells, which lack endogenous adhesion molecules such as cadherin or neural cell adhesion molecule. Some experiments were done on stably transfected L-cells expressing AQP4. As shown in Fig. 1a, AQP4 was expressed in a plasma membrane pattern in the transfected cells with uniform cell-to-cell expression. Experiments were also done in control (nontransfected) L-cells and in L-cells that were transiently transfected with AQP4 or E-cadherin (positive aggregation control).20 Transient transfection produced high-level AQP4 expression in  60% of cells.

(b) Cell aggregation activity. Self-adhesion of L-cells in single cell suspension measured by counting the number of particles (isolated cells + aggregates) at 0, 30, and 60 min (SE; n = 6 independent experiments). Nt/N0 is the ratio of number of particles at time t versus time 0. Differences were not significant between nontransfected and AQP4-expressing cells. Transient transfection with E-cadherin induced significant aggregation (*P b 0.01) compared to nontransfected cells. (c) L-cell adhesion assessed by phase-contrast microscopy in which cell suspensions were allowed to settle onto cover glass after terminating aggregation by glutaraldehyde. Few nontransfected and AQP4-expressing cells were adherent, whereas many E-cadherin-transfected cells formed large aggregates. The scale bar represents 100 m.

1138 AQP4 is expressed highly in brain glial cells, the most relevant cell type where AQP4-dependent cell adhesion might occur. Similar cell­cell adhesion measurements were done on cultured, differentiated glial cells having high AQP4 expression (Fig. 2a) and osmotic water permeability.23 More than 90% of the cultured glial cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive and showed the characteristic stellate morphology. Particles (cells+ cell aggregates) were counted following suspension in standard Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) and Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS containing 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Figure 2b shows greater baseline adhesion of the astrocytes than that seen for L-cells, though no difference in cultures from wild-type versus AQP4 null mice. Elimination of calcium reduced adhesion, but still, no difference was seen in cultures from wild-type versus AQP4 null mice. Figure 2c shows micrographs of glial cells after settling onto a cover glass. Though distinct cell aggregates were seen, their numbers and appearance were similar in the cultures from wild-type and AQP4 null mice. As another sensitive approach to detect adhesion of AQP4-expressing cells, we imaged glial cell aggregates following fluorescent labeling, with

cells from wild-type mice labeled red and those from AQP4 null mice labeled green. We previously established, for in vivo cell migration studies, fluorescence labeling procedures to stain cells brightly without an effect on cell function.6 We reasoned that cell aggregates, after mixing equal numbers of red and green cells, would be enriched in red cells if AQP4 enhanced cell­cell adhesion. Figure 3a shows representative low-magnification phase-contrast and fluorescence micrographs of cells/aggregates after a 30-min incubation in stirred suspension, showing comparable numbers of red and green cells, with both colors seen in aggregates. At high magnification, the aggregates were seen to contain both red and green cells in an apparently random clustering (Fig. 3b, inset). To quantify the results, we counted the numbers of red and green cells in clusters containing at least six distinct cells. As summarized in Fig. 3b by a histogram of red/ green cell counts, a statistical distribution was found, as expected, which was centered at a red/ green ratio of unity for both cell types. These results indicate random, AQP4-independent glial cell adhesion. Similar results were found at 60 min (not shown).

(b) Histogram of the ratio of red-to-green cells in aggregates, with a total of 39 aggregates counted (range, 6 to 24 cells per aggregate). Inset shows example of aggregate at high magnification.

We also studied binding to AQP4 of the putative AQP4 adhesion sequence. Differentiated glial cells or stably transfected AQP4-expressing CHO-K1 cells22 were used. These cell types strongly express AQP4 in orthogonal arrays of particles.22,24 Binding was measured by quantitative imaging of confluent cell layers following incubation with a fluoresceinlabeled 9-mer peptide containing extracellular loop residues of AQP4 proposed to mediate cell­cell adhesion (Fig. 4a, top). Inclusion of an excess of unlabeled peptide was used to detect specific binding. Figure 4a (bottom) shows fluorescence micrographs of glial cells after incubations with fluorescent peptide. Cells were then briefly fixed and washed prior to imaging. Though incubation with peptide increased fluorescence above background, fluorescence was similar in the cells from wild-type and AQP4 null mice and when excess unlabeled peptide was present. Figure 4c summarizes results from a series of measurements done at different concentrations of the fluorescent peptide in glial and CHO cells. No specific peptide binding was found based on similar fluorescence without versus with AQP4 at each concentration of fluorescent peptide and by the lack of competition with a large excess of unlabeled peptide. These data show no specific association of the putative AQP4

adhesion sequence with the externally facing surface of AQP4 in cell membranes. Last, as potentially the most sensitive test of AQP4facilitated membrane adhesion, we measured aggregation of small plasma membrane vesicles (diameter,  200 nm) that strongly expressed AQP4 versus control, nonexpressing vesicles (Fig. 5). Vesicles were prepared by homogenization and density gradient centrifugation of control and AQP4-expressing CHO cells, as done previously.22 After shaking in standard HBSS overnight at high density,  5% of particles were aggregates with diameters greater than 2000 nm, for both control and AQP4-expressing vesicles. As positive controls, nearly all vesicles were contained in aggregates when a low-ionic strength sucrose buffer was used in place of HBSS during the incubation.

Discussion
Our data provide evidence against the involvement of AQP4 in cell­cell adhesion and the proposal that AQP4 serves as an `adhennel'19 with dual transport and adhesion roles. We found, by way of multiple assays, no evidence for increased adhesion/ aggregation in cells expressing AQP4 as compared

AQP4 Role in Cell Adhesion

1141 aggregation in cultured, differentiated glial cells. Glial cells are known to express several adhesion molecules, including the Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecule N-cadherin32 and the Ca2+-independent Ig superfamily molecule nectin-1.25 Our data confirmed Ca2+-dependent and -independent adhesion of cultured glial cells. However, no differences in aggregation were found, using two different assays, in glial cells cultured from brains of wild-type versus AQP4 null mice. These data support the conclusion that molecules other than AQP4 are responsible for glial cell­cell adhesion. Finally, in peptide competition studies, we were unable to detect specific AQP4 binding of the putative 310 -helix containing AQP4 residues 139­ 142. These results suggest that residues in the synthetic peptide have little or no affinity to the extracellular AQP4 surface. In a study of AQP4 membrane diffusion reported recently,33 we studied an rAQP4M23 construct containing a c-myc between residues 139 and 142, which serendipitously destroys the 310 -helix. The cellular processing, water permeability, and ability to form orthogonal arrays of this construct were not different from those of native (untagged) AQP4, providing further support for the conclusions here. In summary, our data do not support the involvement of AQP4 in cell­cell adhesion, which would have ascribed two completely unrelated roles to AQP4. The well-documented water transporting role of AQP4 probably accounts for its various functions in brain water transport, glial cell migration, and neuroexcitation.

with the same cell types not expressing AQP4, including the most relevant cell type, brain glial cells. Also, specific AQP4 binding of a peptide corresponding to the second extracellular domain of AQP4 with its putative adhesion sequence was not seen. As a negative study, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that, under some conditions, extracellular AQP4­AQP4 interactions can occur, though we are doubtful in part because of the absence of any of the predicted adhesion defects in AQP4-deficient mice. The evidence for possible involvement of AQP4 in cell­cell adhesion came from structural analysis of double-layered two-dimensional crystals of recombinant AQP4.15 Notwithstanding the limited structural resolution (3.2 Å) and the variable orientations and distances between the two layers, it was found that apposing AQP4 monomers interacted at residues 139 and 142, located in their second extracellular loops. However, unlike the precise stacking of AQP0 in crystals,17,18 the AQP4 crystals were offset such that tetramers in one membrane line overlay the center of tetramers in the apposing membrane. The crystallography data provide no information about the strength of the AQP4­AQP4 interaction or whether it occurs in real hydrated membranes or cells. If such interactions do occur in cells, it was speculated that the interactions might serve to block AQP4 water permeability and that rapid water flow might force interacting membranes apart. Different cell types utilize different adhesion mechanisms. Well-characterized cell adhesion molecules include cadherins, immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily molecules, and integrins, which perform a wide range of functions at cell contacts such as embryogenesis, immune response, hemostasis, inflammation, and maintenance of tissue integrity (reviewed in Refs. 25,26). Cadherins are single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins with calcium-dependent adhesion, whereas adhesion in Ig superfamily molecules is calcium independent. Cadherins and Ig molecules can form homophilic adhesion, whereas integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins that interact mainly with the extracellular matrix.27 The mouse fibroblast L-cell is a good model to study cell adhesion because it expresses few, if any, adhesion molecules and shows little aggregation in standard cell aggregation assays.28­30 We did not find increased aggregation of L-cells upon transient or stable AQP4 transfection, whereas E-cadherin expression increased aggregation. From the crystal structure data, it was suggested that each AQP4 tetramer interacts with four tetramers in the opposing membrane, such that AQP4 orthogonal arrays might enhance AQP4-facilitated adhesion.19 The various cell types studied here express AQP4 in square, orthogonal arrays.22,31 Various aggregation assays on these cells, including a highly sensitive vesicle aggregation assay, showed no AQP4 dependence. Because AQP4 is expressed mainly in brain glial cells, we studied the possibility of AQP4-dependent

Materials and Methods
Cells and tranfection Mouse fibroblast L-cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL-1) were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. L-cells were transfected with rat AQP4 (rAQP4M23) in plasmid pcDNA3.1 (generated as described previously22) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transformants were selected with 500 g/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Resistant colonies were tested for the expression and cloned. For transient transfections, L-cells were plating onto six-well plates and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. Experiments were done 48 h after transfection. Mouse E-cadherin cDNA in pSTEM1 was provided by Dr. Masatoshi Takeichi (Riken Institute, Japan). Stably transfected CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection CCL-61) expressing AQP422,31 were grown in Ham's nutrient mix supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The clonal cell populations expressed AQP4 protein strongly in their plasma membranes and were highly water permeable. Astroglia were cultured from cortex of wild-type and AQP4 null neonatal mice as previously described.23 At confluence (day 10), primary astroglia were shaken at 200 rpm for 18 h at 37 °C to remove microglia,34 and 0.15 mM dibutyryl cAMP was added to induce differentiation.

Immunocytochemistry Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary 1:200 rabbit anti-AQP4 antibody (Ab) (Millipore) or 1:500 mouse anti-GFAP (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature and detected with Texas Redconjugated goat anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:200 for both; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Nuclei were counterstained blue with 4,6-diamidino-2phenylindole. Sections were visualized on an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a high-resolution Spot color cooled CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI). Cell aggregation assay An established cell aggregation assay was used as previously described.28,29 Briefly, cells were incubated with 0.25% trypsin and 1 mM EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min and dispersed by gentle pipetting to obtain a single cell suspension. The cells were then suspended in HBSS (106 cells/ml), placed in 24-well plates precoated with 2% bovine serum albumin, and rotated on an orbital shaker (80 rpm) at 37 °C for specified periods of time. An equal volume of 2% glutaraldehyde was added to prevent further aggregation or dissociation of aggregates.30 The extent of aggregation was determined from the ratio of the total particle number at time t of incubation (Nt) to the initial particle number (N0). Particle number was determined by counting representative aliquots on a hemocytometer. In a related assay, AQP4 wild-type and null astrocytes were separately labeled with CellTrackerTM Red CMTPX and CellTrackerTM Green CMFDA (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with dyes (2 M) in Opti-MEM for 30 min, washed two times with Opti-MEM, incubated for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and suspended as above in HBSS. Cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and incubated as described above. Green and red fluorescence images of particles/aggregates after deposition on a cover glass using a Nikon 2000 epifluorescence microscope were obtained. In some experiments, aggregation was measured in Ca2+/Mg2+-free HBSS containing 10 mM EDTA. Peptide association studies Astrocytes or CHO cells were seeded on the BD FalconTM eight-well CultureSlides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) until confluence. A peptide (NH2-PPSVVGGLG-COOH) containing amino acid residues 139­142 of AQP4 was synthesized with or without an N-terminus fluorescein label (Sigma Genosys). HBSS (100 l) containing different concentrations of the fluorescent peptide (1­500 M) was added in each well and incubated at room temperature for 30 min; 2% glutaraldehyde was then added to prevent dissociation of bound peptide, and cells were washed with PBS. Experiments were also done with a large excess of unlabeled peptide included with the fluorescent peptide. Cell-associated fluorescence was determined by quantitative image analysis. Vesicle aggregation assay Plasma membrane vesicles were isolated from control and AQP4-expressing CHO-K1 cells by sucrose gradient

AQP4 Role in Cell Adhesion centrifugation as previously described.22 Cells from five 25-cm diameter plastic dishes were grown to confluence (1­3 × 108 cells/dish), released by agitation in PBS containing 10 mM ethylene glycol bis(-aminoethyl ether)N,Ntetraacetic acid, and washed twice (100g, 10 min) at 4 °C in homogenizing buffer (HB; 250 mM sucrose and 10 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.4). The pellet was resuspended in HB containing antipain (1 g/ml), pepstatin (1 g/ml), and benzamidine (15 g/ml) and homogenized by 20 strokes of a glass Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500g for 10 min at 4 °C and adjusted to 1.4 M sucrose, 10 mM Tris­HCl, and 0.2 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). A discontinuous sucrose gradient [2 M sucrose (2.5 ml), 1.6 M (5 ml), 1.4 M (10 ml, containing homogenate), 1.2 M (10 ml), and 0.8 M (2.5 ml)] was centrifuged for 2.5 h at 25,000 rpm in an SW 28 rotor, and 5-ml fractions were collected. After centrifugation (25,000 rpm, 30 min), the plasma membrane vesicles were resuspended using a 30-gauge needle in 100 l HB or HBSS and shaken overnight at 4 °C. Aggregation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 2% glutaraldehyde. Vesicle diameter was determined by quasielastic light scattering using a Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, Inc., Southborough, MA). The intensity of the laser light scattered by the samples was detected at an angle of 90°. Vesicle size distributions were determined by autocorrelation analysis using Malvern software. Immunoblot analysis L-cells were harvested and homogenized in 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 2 g/ml aprotinin, 2 g/ml pepstatin A, 2 g/ml leupeptin, and 100 g/ml serine protease inhibitor (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at - 80 °C. Protein concentration was measured using the Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with rabbit anti-AQP4 (1:1000, Chemicon) or anti--actin antibody (1:2000, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) followed by horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (1:10.000, GE Healthcare) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
