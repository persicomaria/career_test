Conformational Changes of Ribose-binding Protein and Two Related Repressors are Tailored to fit the Functional Need
Sherry L. Mowbray* and A. Joakim Bjorkman È
Department of Molecular Biology, Swedish Agricultural University, Uppsala S-75124, Sweden The structures and conformational changes of the periplasmic ribosebinding protein and two repressors, PurR and LacI, were compared. Although the closed, ligand-bound structures of the three proteins are very similar, they differ greatly in the degree and direction in which they open, as well as in the amount of internal rearrangement within the domains during that process. Water molecules and a relatively symmetrical inter-domain connection region assist in the large opening observed for the binding protein, while the design of the repressors appears to preclude such dramatic movements. The dimeric nature of the latter proteins, an important aspect in their binding of pseudo-symmetrical DNA sequences, also appears to be a determinant in the allowed motion. Slight differences in the structure of PurR and LacI explain how they can converge to a similar DNA-binding state in response to different binding states of their small molecule effector.

Introduction
Similarity between the periplasmic monosaccharide-binding proteins and the effector-binding regions of the lac repressor family was noted when È the ®rst sequences appeared (Muller-Hill, 1983). More recent observations that other repressors related to LysR resemble the proteins of the topologically distinct ion-binding protein family (Tyrrell et al., 1997) suggest that at least two independent gene splicing events occurred during evolutionary history. The sequence identities between the repressors and the most similar binding proteins are low (10-25 %), indicating that it is the structural framework that is important, rather than particular details of the design. Repressors of the lac family were judged to be most similar to the binding protein for ribose

(RBP), based on sequence and other criteria (Tam & Saier, 1993; Bowie et al., 1991; Schumacher et al., 1993). The sequence (Groarke et al., 1983) and structure (Mowbray & Cole, 1992) of Escherichia coli RBP assisted in the generation of repressor models used in rationalizing the effects of various mutations (Mauzy & Hermodson, 1992; Nichols et al., 1993; Markiewicz et al., 1994; Hsieh et al., 1994). The structural similarity later allowed the use of RBP as an aid in the solution of the X-ray structures of the purine and lac repressors (Schumacher et al., 1994; Friedman et al., 1995). Both repressors and binding proteins include two a/b domains connected by three localized segments of amino acid chain; an N-terminal extension carries the DNA-binding headpiece of the repressors (Kaptein et al., 1985). Both types of proteins have been shown to undergo conformational changes in association with binding of small molecule ligand. In RBP, binding of ribose between the two domains favors closure of the protein (Shilton È et al., 1996; Bjorkman & Mowbray, 1998), and so prepares it for functional interactions with membrane components in chemotaxis and transport (Galloway & Furlong, 1977). In the lac-like repressors, conformational changes that result from corepressor or inducer binding affect the function of the attached DNA-binding headpieces

488 (Schumacher et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 1996). In an interesting twist, binding of corepressor to PurR increases its af®nity for DNA, while the binding of inducer to LacI has the opposite effect. The nature of any conformational changes is not at present known for the LysR family, although it is presumed that they, like their periplasmic-binding protein counterparts, open and close on coactivator/corepressor binding. One fundamental difference that must be remembered in interpreting such information is that the binding proteins are monomers, while dimer or tetramer forms of repressors are essential for their interactions with pseudosymmetrical DNA sequences. Here, we compare the structures and conformational changes of RBP, the purine repressor (PurR) and the lac repressor (LacI), relate them to differences in structure and aggregation state, and discuss these results in the context of the different functions of the three proteins.

1 and 2; the residues comprising the domains are de®ned in Table 1. The three segments of amino acid chain that link these two domains will be referred to collectively as the connection region. Comparison of the small molecule-bound forms The closed, ligand-bound forms of RBP and the repressors (Figure 1) are most similar to each other in all pair-wise comparisons. Dimers of the effector-bound repressors are formed around crystallographic or non-crystallographic 2-fold axes, and so their subunits are considered to be identical. The repressors show the greatest resemblance: 253 Ca Ê atoms match within a 3.8 A cut-off, with an r.m.s. Ê distance of 1.38 A. In comparisons of RBP to either repressor, 243 Ca atoms match, with an r.m.s. disÊ tance of 1.73 A. In Figure 2, the three sequences are aligned with the aid of these structural superpositions. Amino acid identity between pairs of proteins in the structurally equivalent regions was calculated to be 26 % for PurR and LacI, 25 % for RBP and PurR, and 23 % for the RBP/LacI pair. Small molecule-bound forms of both PurR and LacI are slightly more open than the corresponding form of RBP. When the domains of PurR and RBP Ê were aligned separately with a tightened 1.5 A cutoff, 73 Ca atoms matched in domain 1, and 82 Ca atoms matched in domain 2; the b-sheets agreed best in each case. Nearly identical results were obtained with a LacI/RBP comparison. In Figure 1, where the subunits on the right are shown with domains 2 aligned, a similar relative rotation of $15  was required to optimally superimpose the domain 1 of either repressor on that of RBP. In the closed structures, D-ribopyranose is bound to RBP, hypoxanthine to PurR, and IPTG

Results
Structural definitions Each a/b domain of RBP is composed of two non-contiguous segments of amino acid chain (Mowbray & Cole, 1992; Figure 1(a)). The two domains resemble each other, with a nearly perfect axis of internal pseudo-symmetry. Repressor subunits also include two similar domains (Figure 1(b) and (c); Schumacher et al., 1994; Lewis et al., 1996) that together form the core corepressor or inducerbinding region. This functional unit is augmented by a primarily helical DNA-binding headpiece (about 60 residues in size) attached to its N terminus (Figures 1(b) and (c)). The two a/b units of each protein are hereinafter designated as domains

to LacI. Although two different binding orientations have been reported for IPTG in LacI, the placement of that ligand, and the residues with which it interacts, are the same in both instances (Friedman et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 1996). The ligands are trapped at a very similar position in each structure, where the cross-over points of the two a/b folds meet to produce a binding pocket (Figure 1). As a result, similarly placed side-chains drawn from loops and the N-terminal ends of helices make hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the respective small molecules (Figure 2). There is some conservation in both types of interactions, as had been

predicted earlier based on sequence alignments alone (Schumacher et al., 1993). Asp215 of RBP corresponds well with Asp275 of PurR and Asp274 of LacI. This residue is a conserved Ramachandran outlier necessary for the design of the connection region and binding site, and is associated with a buried aspartic acid side-chain and a serine or threonine residue. Aromatic stacking residues in the RBP-binding site (Phe15, 16 and 164) generally correspond to similar residues in the repressors (Figure 2). Arg141 of RBP is conserved as Arg196 of PurR (Arg197 in LacI) and found in a similar position, with its guanido group stacking onto a nearby aromatic residue

Figure 2. Alignment of sequences of RBP, PurR and LacI using the structures of the closed forms. The entire sequence is shown for RBP, and only for the effector-binding portions of PurR and LacI. Segments that match within Ê a 3.8 A cut-off in comparisons of pairs of structures are underlined on RBP (with PurR), PurR (with LacI) and LacI (with RBP). Secondary structure of RBP de®ned using the program DSSP (Kabsch & Sander, 1983) is shown as ahelix (a), b-sheet (b) or b-turn (t); in essentially all cases, the same secondary structure is found in equivalent parts of the other two structures. Binding site residues are indicated as r, p or l, respectively, for ribose, hypoxanthine and IPTG.

(Flocco & Mowbray, 1994). Although this arginine residue does not make any direct interactions with the corepressor in PurR, it helps orient Asp275 in the site through hydrogen bonding. This cluster of residues, drawn primarily from domain 2, is the most obvious conserved feature of the binding sites. Otherwise, conservation is related more to an appropriate position in the structure than to particular amino acid residues. Some residues of the repressors that had been predicted to interact with a small molecule ligand do not, while other interactions were missed, either because the relevant loops or the local character or orientation of the ligand are different. These alterations originate with the need to accommodate differences in ligand size

and polarity, but a detailed comparison will have to await higher-resolution structures of the bound repressors. Opening of RBP Crystallographic studies have demonstrated È three forms of ligand-free RBP (Bjorkman & Mowbray, 1998). The least open form, which is used in the present comparison, was observed for the wild-type protein in several different packing environments and is presumed to be the most common solution species. Two more open proteins were observed in a mutant RBP crystal, and represent additional movement along the same conformational trajectory. All three open RBP molecules

Signi®cant movements are observed in all three connection segments, with the largest changes occurring at positions that are not constrained by hydrogen bonds. Some smaller changes are also apparent, due to altered domain-domain contacts, and less frequently, to differences in crystal packing or mobile loops. Calculated r.m.s. differences for the individual domains (Table 1) are only slightly larger than the estimated error at this resolution, and small changes are again seen to be associated with loops and local repacking (Figure 4(a)). Opening of RBP is thus a nearly pure hinge motion (Gerstein et al., 1994; Lesk & Chothia, 1984). The two domains rotate 43  with respect to each other with little disruption of their internal structure. The observed rotation axis passes diagonally through the connection region, near equivalent points located just inside domains 1 and 2, and so re¯ects the internal symmetry of the molecule.

Opening of PurR In contrast to the symmetrical closed dimer of PurR that binds DNA, the two subunits in the open, ligand-free dimer are not equivalent (Schumacher et al., 1995). Although the same conclusions generally apply to both open subunits, the A molecule (subunit on the right in Figure 4(b)) has lower temperature factors and a better Ramachandran plot. A Ca torsion angle difference plot for open (A molecule) and closed PurR repressors is shown in Figure 3(b). The background level of differences is larger throughout this plot than was observed for RBP, partly re¯ecting the lower resolution of the PurR structures. PurR also shows more signi®cant changes at points outside the connection region, primarily in domain 1. These conclusions are substantiated and extended by least-squares superposition of the individual domains (Table 1). The changes within Ê domain 1 on opening (r.m.s. difference $1.6 A; Table 1) are signi®cantly larger than the differences Ê between subunits A and B (0.63 A) in the same regions. Despite this, approximately 70 % of this domain's structure remains static on opening (Figure 4(b)). A portion of the domain near the connection region is altered, at least in part due to lost inter-domain contacts. On the opposite side of the same domain, the loop containing residues 70-74 is also affected. This latter rearrangement seems to re¯ect the loss of key interactions in the corepressor binding site (Schumacher et al., 1995), as well as differences in subunit-subunit interactions (see below). The portions of domain 1 with the greatest differences between open and closed forms are also those which differ most between the open A and B molecules. Although these segments have the highest temperature factors in the model,

In each case, the angular difference was obtained by subtracting the virtual torsion angle, a(i), for the open molecule from that for the closed, ligand-bound form. Using estimates of Ca coordinate errors at various resolutions (Kleywegt, 1996; Table 1), the angular error was expected to be roughly 8  for the RBP structures, 14  for the PurR structures and 20  for the LacI structures. A working signi®cance level equal to twice that value is shown as a broken line for each protein.

Ribbon representations of the open forms of (a) RBP, (b) PurR and (c) LacI are shown in stereo, with domains 2 (top) of the subunit at the right viewed in the same orientation as shown in Figure 1. (c) Additional helices that mediate tetramer interactions in LacI are shown at the top of the Figure; at the bottom is seen the N-terminal headpiece in the DNA-binding form of that repressor. Residues differing by more than twice the estimated Ca error (Table 1) within each protein are indicated in black on the right-hand subunit of each open form. Residues matching Ê Ê within a 0.8 A cut-off for RBP are: 3-54, 58-66, 71-201, 209-260 and 267-271. PurR segments matching within a 1.4 A Ê cut-off are: 69-74, 88-89, 144-160, 161-187, 194-292, 310-334. For LacI, segments within the 1.8 A cut-off are: 63-70, 7488, 90-100, 104-126, 131-140, 145-148, 153-157, 164-167, 169-244, 246-276, 278-305 and 315-330. The axis of rotation that describes the opening of each molecule is shown only on the open subunit at the right. That describing the opening of the B subunit of PurR has been placed appropriately on the A subunit of that repressor.

the difference in local structure between the open forms appears to be signi®cant. Rearrangements are smaller in domain 2, but still interpretable in terms of known structural events. Electron density for residues 188-193 is missing in both open structures of PurR. This disordered segment contains two residues that lose interactions with hypoxanthine, as well as inter-

domain contacts (Schumacher et al., 1995). The remaining portions are essentially identical in structure, as re¯ected in the small r.m.s differences between open and closed structures (Table 1) as Ê well as the even smaller (0.34 A) difference between the A and B subunits themselves. The angle between domains 1 and 2 was calculated here to be changed by 24  on opening the A

493 Figure 4(c). The lower resolution of these structures makes a detailed analysis impossible, although the placement of the conformational differences suggests that a combination of lost inter-domain and ligand interactions are important. Comparison of the opening motions Each protein may be described as opening via a rotation of one domain relative to the other. However, as Figures 4 and 5 show, there are dramatic differences in how this is accomplished. Both types of observed PurR opening are less pronounced than that of RBP (17-24  rather than 43  ), and the axes of rotation differ by 66  and 56  in direction, for A and B molecules, respectively. The PurR axes are also found at very different positions within the protein compared to RBP; both are located solely within domain 1, and pass no Ê closer than 12 A to the RBP axis. Thus, the conformational change of a PurR subunit is largely a twisting of domain 1 relative to domain 2, rather than the rather symmetrical hinge motion seen in RBP (Figure 5). A certain amount of rearrangement in domain 1 of PurR accompanies this change, apparently due to altered ligand and inter-domain contacts, as well as to stresses in the connection region itself. The opening of a LacI subunit follows a third pattern. The angles between the LacI and PurR opening axes are 66  and 53  for the A and B subunits, respectively, while the directions of the LacI and RBP opening axes differ by 65  . The small (6  ) domain rotation of LacI is more reminiscent of actual opening than the PurR change (Figure 5), but again it is not pseudo-symmetrical like the RBP motion.

subunit, and by 17  for the B subunit, with only small translational components. The two similar axes of rotation that relate the open subunits of PurR to the closed ones are shown superimposed on molecule A in Figure 4(b). Although both axes pass closest to the main-chain of the protein near residue 296 in domain 1, and cross the dimer interface near residue 93, they differ by 15  in their direction. Domain 2 is not available for small molecule binding in the open form of PurR; the domain 1 loop at 72-73 moves into the binding site, as well as becoming less ordered. It seems possible that sugar docks ®rst onto domain 1, then is ``engulfed'' the next time the molecule closes. A more detailed analysis will have to await further structural data. Opening of LacI The four molecules in the asymmetric unit of inducer-free (DNA-bound) LacI crystals show a single open conformation (Lewis et al., 1996). A Ca torsion angle difference plot comparing the effectorbinding regions of open and closed LacI is shown in Figure 3(c). Despite a higher background level of differences due to the lower resolution, the plot shows large rearrangements, particularly in domain 1, rather than well-de®ned movement at the interdomain connections. Superposition of the individual domains further supports this conclusion (Figure 4(c) and Table 1). Using a cut-off of twice the estimated coordinate error to locate signi®cant changes, at least 30 % of domain 1 is rearranged, while domain 2 remains essentially static. The angle between the two domains of LacI was calculated to be altered by 6  on opening; the axis of rotation that relates the two domains of the open subunit to those of the closed repressor is shown in

Figure 5. Schematic comparison of the opening motions of the three proteins is shown in stereo. The viewpoint is the same as that used in Figures 1 and 4. The positions of the superimposed domains 2 (top) and domains 1 (bottom) of the closed proteins are represented by boxes (black, broken lines), and the three connection segments by strands. The positions of the domains 1 of the open proteins are indicated by boxes: RBP (red), PurR (orange) and LacI (blue), the equivalent corner of each box is marked with a diamond. The relevant axes are indicated in the same color, and the sense of the rotation about them is shown by curved arrows.

494 While the main-chain structure in the connection region is super®cially similar in the three closed proteins (illustrated for RBP and PurR in Figures 1 and 6), it is possible to suggest why they do not open in the same ways. The introduction of a proline residue at position 323 of PurR prevents a critical rotation in a main-chain torsion angle at RBP f-265. A similar proline residue substitution at position 293 has a similar, although smaller, effect. Other important differences appear to result from residue substitutions in the repressors (speci®cally Asn161, Pro293 and Pro323 in PurR) that displace two water molecules found in the connection region of closed RBP. On opening the binding protein, one of these water molecules is lost (that at the top in Figure 6), resulting in a direct hydrogen bond between 104-N and 263-O (equivalent to residues 161 and 321 of PurR). The equivalent event is prevented in PurR by changes that make the connection region more rigid. First, the cavity that held the movable ``hinge water'' of RBP is already ®lled by the side-chain of Pro323, and second, a hydrogen bond between 321-O and the side-chain nitrogen atom of Asn161 exists in both open and closed PurR. (The latter residue is an aspartic acid in RBP, which cannot make the same interaction.) Two further substitutions that introduce a chargecharge interaction between Glu164 and His322 may also be important. In sum, the effect is to make the inter-domain connections more rigid, and so force motion to occur elsewhere, primarily within domain 1. Other main-chain torsion angles are affected by repressor substitutions, altering the orientation of the domains in the closed form, and thus the starting point and direction of allowed rotation.

Conformational Changes of RBP and Related Repressors

In LacI, a hydrogen bond is in place between 162-N and 319-O in both open and closed structures (the equivalents of 104-N and 263-O in RBP), and therefore the removable hinge water of RBP cannot be situated there. The second hinge water molecule also appears to be displaced by the Phe161 substitution. Thus, like PurR, LacI cannot make use of this mechanism for achieving ¯exibility in the connection region, with the observed motion again concentrated in domain 1. A more detailed analysis of this protein is probably not wise, because of the lower resolution of the structures. Intra-subunit interactions RBP is a monomer in solution even at high protein concentration (Shilton et al., 1996). Both open and closed repressors instead form dimers, a critical part of their ability to recognize pseudo-symmetrical DNA sequences. LacI is actually a dimer of dimers: the two helices shown at the top of Figures 1(c) and 4(c), together with those of a second dimer, form a four-helix bundle. The tetrameric arrangement probably has longer-range effects on DNA structure (Friedman et al., 1995). Although simultaneous binding to DNA surely affects the relative placement of the two dimer pairs, there appears to be no link with small molecule-induced conformational changes. In the available crystal structures, the closest approaches between the dimers involve only surfaces of domain 2 that are unaffected by small molecule binding. The term ``intra-subunit interactions'' is used for the present purposes to mean those between the two subunits in the PurR and LacI dimers, as shown in Figures 1 and 4. These

Figure 6. Inter-domain connection regions of closed, ligand-bound forms of RBP (shown in atomic colors with blue labels) and PurR (blue with red labels) are shown in stereo, superimposed using domain 2. The axis of opening RBP is shown as a thicker red line. The two hinge water molecules of the closed RBP structure are shown as red spheres (with hydrogen bonds as red lines), and the residues of PurR that displace them are labeled. The water molecule at top/left is that lost on opening RBP. The hydrogen bond between the side-chain of Asn161 and 321-O of PurR is shown as a blue line.

495 DNA binding Binding of the small molecule effectors to the repressors alters their ability to bind DNA, with the inducer-free LacI and the repressor-bound PurR being the active species. Although DNA might in¯uence the equilibria observed in vivo, it is almost certainly the binding of the effector that is critical, since appropriate DNA will presumably be available at all times. The headpieces of PurR and LacI are furthermore not visible in the X-ray structures of the inactive forms, leading to the proposal that they are generally disordered in those cases (Schumacher et al., 1995; Lewis et al., 1996). This idea is supported by other experimental data (Schumacher et al., 1992; Nagadoi et al., 1995; Spronk et al., 1996; Falcon et al., 1997). The manner in which this contrary effect is achieved is thus of central interest. In the repressor forms that do bind DNA, the resemblance of the headpieces is striking (Figures 4 and 7). A total of 47 out of 55 Ca atoms of one headpiece from corepressor-bound PurR and induÊ cer-free LacI match within a 1.5 A cut-off with an Ê . Moreover, this superposir.m.s. difference of 0.8 A tion places the other headpieces in perfect alignment in the two repressors. PurR and LacI in fact do bind DNA in the same manner, with pairs of ``hinge'' helices inserted in the minor groove, and helix-turn-helix units interacting with the major groove (Lewis et al., 1996; Schumacher et al., 1994). The observed position of bound DNA is in excellent agreement. Our comparison shows that the similarity extends to the interaction of the DNA-bound headpieces with their respective domains 1 (Figure 7). Despite the open/closed difference of the entire repressors, the alignment of the headpieces results in very similar positioning of both portions of the attached domains 1. Interactions of headpiece residues near 50 (adjacent to the DNA) with domain 1 residues near 114 of PurR and 117 of LacI appear to be the primary determinant. The separation between pairs of residues 117 in the open (DNAÊ Ê binding) LacI dimer is 12.3 A, while it is 11.4 A for the equivalent residues 114 in the closed (DNAbinding) form of PurR. In the non-DNA-binding forms of the repressors, the same distances are Ê Ê 6.2 A in LacI (closed) and 5.7 A in PurR (open). The residues involved are not conserved in the two proteins, although a hydrogen bond between 113O and 49-N of PurR appears to be present in LacI as well. Their importance is, however, supported by mutational studies of LacI (Markiewicz et al., 1994). The rest of the domains 1 in these nonDNA-binding forms is placed very differently in PurR and LacI. Insertions and other structural changes near residues 100 and 130 seem to be important in creating a situation whereby the slightly different structures and subunit-subunit interactions of the two repressors can converge to the same DNA-binding state, but in the opposite conformational form.

interactions are affected in distinct ways by effector-induced conformational changes. The dimers of the repressors are quite similar. Both consist of a parallel arrangement, with domain 1 of each subunit in contact with domain 1 of the neighbor, and similarly for the pairs of domains 2. The domain 2-domain 2 contacts of the repressors are super®cially similar, and altered very little by small molecule binding. They are therefore presumed to be the dominant ones in dimer formation. In PurR, residues near 223, 252 and 282 of domain 2 in one subunit interact with the same surface in the other subunit. An equivalent set of residues makes contact between the domains 2 of LacI, and are similarly unaffected by effector binding. There is, however, little sequence conservation among the residues that make these contacts. The PurR subunits also make extensive contact on the ¯at face of the a/b fold of domain 1. The two PurR opening axes approach each other at the edge strands of the domains, and the associated rotations will have the opposite sense at that point. The opening of the two subunits of PurR simultaneously thus causes a relative twisting motion of the domains 1 on this ¯at surface (33  about the unlabelled axis in Figure 7(a)). The Ca atoms of the Ê pairs of Ile93 residues remain 4.6 A apart, and hydrogen bonds are maintained between the 92-O of each subunit and 94-N of the other. Although the buried surface area on the subunit-subunit interface changes little on opening, additional hydrogen bonds form between the two b-strands that result in the generation of a 12-stranded sheet including both subunits. The formation of the super-sheet probably prevents the continuation of the opening motion, which would indeed destroy the inter-subunit interactions if continued further, exposing hydrophobic surfaces to solvent. A number of smaller conformational changes within domain 1 accompany this movement, as described above (compare this region of Figure 4(b) with the equivalent in Figure 1(b)). The similar dimers of LacI also make subunitsubunit contact on the ¯at surface of domain 1, in a manner that resembles PurR for the closed proteins. These interactions are, however, affected in a different manner by effector binding. LacI does not make a super-sheet in the open form, and other differences are apparent. The LacI dimer interface is less hydrophobic, with a greater proportion of salt links and hydrogen bonds. It has been proposed that the formation of more speci®c interactions in inducer-bound LacI stabilizes it in the same way that the T form of haemoglobin is preferred in the absence of oxygen (Lewis et al., 1996). The observed LacI motion changes the orientation of the two domains 1 by about 10  , in a rotation nearly perpendicular to that observed in PurR (Figure 7(c)). Continuing to open in this direction would soon compromise subunit-subunit interactions in both domain 1 and domain 2.

Conformational Changes of RBP and Related Repressors

Stereo diagrams of the effector-binding regions as observed in the non-DNA-binding forms of (a) PurR and (c) LacI, from the same view with respect to the domain 1 of the A subunit (on the right). (b) The DNA-binding forms of the two repressors were superimposed in using its headpiece (on the left). The axis that describes opening within each subunit (as in Figure 4) is marked in (a) and (c), while that which describes the relative motion of the domains 1 within each repressor dimer is not labeled.

Discussion
Binding proteins and repressors have very different roles in biology. The former are periplasmic proteins that act as the primary receptors for chemotaxis and transport, while the latter are cytoplasmic proteins involved in the control of DNA expression. Both types of proteins must move as part of their function. Changes in binding protein structure associated with the presence of small molecule ligand help ensure that the correct connections are made with chemotaxis and transport partners. Similarly, the repressor forms that are favored when corepressor or inducer is bound

have different interactions with DNA than those found in the absence of effector. The observed structural relationship between the two types of proteins almost certainly arises from the fact that gene duplication is a convenient way of conveying the machinery of motion to different functional settings. Binding of a small molecule ligand has been reported previously to favor closure of the ribosebinding protein and the two related repressors compared here (Mowbray & Cole, 1992; Schumacher et al., 1994, 1995; Friedman et al., 1995; È Lewis et al., 1996; Bjorkman & Mowbray, 1998). The present work extends this to show that, while

Conformational Changes of RBP and Related Repressors

497 does not bind DNA, a single unique open conformation is probably not required. The lac repressor exhibits yet another pattern in its behavior. As for PurR, the interactions of the domains 2 serve as a stable platform to allow relative reorientations of the domains 1, with corresponding changes in the attached DNA-binding headpieces. The approximately 6  rotation is more subtle than that in either RBP or PurR, and about a different axis. Again, larger changes would almost certainly disrupt the dimer; the rearrangements observed within domain 1 suggest that some stress already occurs. The movements of the repressor subunits are clearly more constrained by their participation in dimers, and any large changes must be accompanied by signi®cant repacking, both within the domains and at the subunit-subunit interface. Both repressors, therefore, represent less dramatic examples of hinge motion. The most interesting feature of the repressors, however, is that their conformational changes have different functional consequences. Despite the great similarity of their closed, ligand-bound forms, it is the corepressorbound PurR that binds DNA most tightly, while the inducer-free form of LacI ful®ls that role for the lac system. This is a direct result of the slight differences in structure and subunit-subunit interactions of the two repressors. Their distinct conformational changes cause them to converge to a similar arrangement of the appropriate parts of their domains 1 and headpieces, only in the appropriate DNA-binding forms. The conformational changes of the binding proteins and repressors thus provide an instructive example of Nature's capacity for using similar tools to carry out different biological tasks. Highly similar proteins recognize different ligands, are affected differently by them, and so enabled to carry out distinct functions.

all of the proteins undergo relative movement of the two domains, the manner in which each changes is very different. Opening and closing of RBP is a dramatic example of almost pure hinge motion. Two water molecules in the inter-domain connection region aid in the relative movement of the two domains by 43  or more with little effect on their internal structure; loss of one of these water molecules seems to be a critical event in opening. The ``goal'' of the motion appears to be to make a new contact between the two domains, thereby stabilizing the open form. It is known that ligand-free protein can compete to some extent with the correct ligandbound one in transport (Wolf et al., 1994; Bohl et al., 1995; Shilton & Mowbray, 1995; Merino et al., 1995), and presumably such interference can be minimized by ensuring that the ligand-free form is rarely closed. A relatively large conformational change is required to make contact in this way; it appears that a much smaller one would suf®ce for entry and exit of ligands from the binding site (Luck & Falke, 1991). The direction of opening RBP is determined by the design of its inter-domain connections, and presumably is matched to corresponding motions of the membrane-bound permease. The movable hinge water molecule of RBP, as well as the monomeric nature of the binding protein, allow a relatively free motion of the binding protein along that path. The need to maintain the dimer, and to convey the correct signals to the attached DNA-binding headpieces, appear to be the key issues for the repressors. The purine repressor thus does not open in the same direction as RBP, as that motion would soon disrupt subunit-subunit contacts. It is not necessary, and probably not desirable, for the conformational change to be as large as that required by the binding protein, and so the interdomain connections are redesigned to reduce ¯exibility (partly by excluding the hinge water molecules), and alter the direction of motion allowed. A smaller, $20  , opening results about an axis nearly perpendicular to that used by RBP. The direction chosen is one of few that would allow a change of this magnitude, given the double constraints of the inter-domain connections on one side and subunit-subunit contacts on the other. In the resulting conformational change, there is more rearrangement within the domains than is observed for RBP. Corepressor binding has been observed to be cooperative (Choi & Zalkin, 1992), indicating that one subunit is unlikely to change conformation without affecting the other. It is possible that the observation of two distinct open forms of PurR in the same dimer is an artifact of crystal packing, but the subunits' similarity to each other, and the observed formation of the super-sheet structure in the open dimer, suggest that the present structure closely resembles the predominant form in solution. Because their combined function lies mostly in providing a repressor dimer that

Materials and Methods
Coordinates are available in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (Bernstein et al., 1977) for hypoxanthine and Ê DNA-bound PurR (1pnr, 2.7 A resolution; Schumacher et al., 1994) and its free corepressor-binding domain Ê (1dbq, 2.2 A resolution; Schumacher et al., 1995), as well Ê as for ribose-bound (2dri, 1.7 A resolution; Mowbray & Ê Cole, 1992) and ligand-free (1urp, 2.3 A resolution; È Bjorkman & Mowbray, 1998) forms of RBP. LacI coordiÊ Ê nate sets 1lbh (3.2 A resolution) and 1lbg (4.8 A resolution; Lewis et al., 1996) represent the IPTG-bound and DNA-bound forms, respectively. Unless otherwise speci®ed, the A molecules were used where non-crystallographic symmetry exists. A Ca-based virtual torsion angle (Flocco & Mowbray, 1995) was used as an aid in ®nding conformational changes. For each residue i in a given coordinate set, a dihedral angle a(i) was de®ned using the segment Ca(i À 1)-Ca(i)-Ca(i  1)-Ca(i  2). Estimates of angular and coordinate error for the comparisons were also calculated as described by Floco & Mowbray (1995). The portions that were considered equivalent were then

aligned using the least-squares explicit option of the graphics program O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1997) and with LSQMAN (Kleywegt & Jones, 1997), using Ca atoms only. The alignments for each domain were improved using cut-off values equal to twice the estimates of Ca error (Table 1). The sequences were aligned by hand using such structural alignments. To assess the rotation of the domains in the different conformations, the appropriate O matrix was used to place the coordinates of domain 2 of each open structure on the corresponding domain of the closed, ligand-bound structure. The transformation required to align the domains 1 was then obtained by the original alignment procedure. The proÈ gram package X-PLOR (Brunger, 1992) was used to calculate the angle and axis of rotation, which were related to the protein coordinates using an awk script obtainable from the authors. Figures were prepared with the aid of the programs CA-Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates International, Islandia, NY), O (Jones & Kjeldgaard, 1997) and Canvas (Deneba Systems, Inc.).
