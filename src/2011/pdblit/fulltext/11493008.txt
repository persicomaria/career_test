Ê The 1.8 A crystal structure of 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC) bound to chymotrypsin reveals that this inhibitor forms a planar cinnamate acyl-enzyme complex. The phenyl ring of the bound inhibitor forms numerous van der Waals contacts in the S1 pocket of the enzyme, with the p-hydroxyl group donating a hydrogen bond to the main-chain oxygen atom of Ser217, and the o-hydroxyl group forming a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Val227. The structure of the acyl-enzyme complex suggests that the mechanism of inhibition of 7-HC involves nucleophilic attack by the Ser195 Og atom on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor, accompanied by the breaking of the 2-pyrone ring of the inhibitor, and leading to the formation of a cinnamate acylenzyme derivative via a tetrahedral transition state. Comparisons with structures of photoreversible cinnamates bound to chymotrypsin reveal that although 7-HC interacts with the enzyme in a similar fashion, the binding of 7-HC to chymotrypsin takes place in a productive conformation in contrast to the photoreversible cinnamates. In summary, the 7-HC-chymotrypsin complex provides basic insight into the inhibition of chymotrypsin by natural coumarins and provides a structural basis for the design of more potent mechanism-based inhibitors against a wide range of biologically important chymotrypsin-like enzymes.

Introduction
Proteinases play key roles in a number of physiological processes such as digestion, blood clotting and coagulation,1 and in diseases such as emphysema,2 arthritis, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease,3 and brain tumor development,4 thus making this class of enzymes an obvious target for structure-based drug design. Among the serine proteinases, chymotrypsin is perhaps the most intensively studied and best understood enzyme. Because of this and the involvement of many chymotrypsin-like enzymes in disease processes, chymotrypsin has been the target of numerous studies directed towards the development of mechanismbased inhibitors. Acylating agents such as isocoumarins,5 coumarinic derivatives,6 4-substituted benzoxazinones, acyl esters and amides, azapepAbbreviations used: 7-HC, 7-hydroxycoumarin.

tides, and isocyanates7,8 bind to the target serine proteinase in an orientation appropriate for catalytic turnover. These inhibitors possess a latently reactive functional group that is activated during catalysis, leading to the covalent modi®cation of the enzyme. Tailor-made isocoumarin inhibitors of serine proteinases such as chymotrypsin, trypsin and elastase have been studied in great detail.9,10 We have determined the crystal structure of 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC), commonly known as umbelliferone, in complex with g-chymotrypsin. 7-HC is a natural coumarin isolated from many plant species of the Umbelliferae family.11 This is the ®rst report on the crystal structure of a natural coumarin in complex with g-chymotrypsin. 7-HC is an inhibitor of chymotrypsin that binds to the active site and leads to the formation of an acylenzyme derivative. The binding of 7-HC to chymotrypsin is consistent with the characteristics of an acylating agent that involves the nucleophilic attack of the active site Ser195 and ring opening (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
The structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex resulting from the reaction of 7-HC with chymotrypsin has been determined by X-ray crystallograÊ phy to 1.8 A resolution. Data collection and re®nement statistics are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The coordinate error of the complex was calculated Ê Ê to be 0.19 A using Luzzati's method12 and 0.14 A 13 using a Sigma-A plot. Structure of the complex Structural analysis of the complex reveals that 7HC has acylated the enzyme, resulting in 2,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid bound to active site Ser195 by an ester linkage (Figures 2 and 3). 7-HC is bound

as a planar structure in the active site. The carbonyl carbon atom adopts planar trigonal geometry and forms a covalent bond to the Ser195 Og atom. The re®ned position of the carbonyl oxygen atom is within hydrogen bonding distance to the amide nitrogen atoms of Gly193 and Ser195 (the oxyanion hole). The bonds to the carbonyl carbon are consistent with an sp2-hybridized acyl intermediate.14 The Ser195 side-chain (w1  À 65.1  ) has moved 12.2  compared to the native structure (w1  À 77.3  ).27 The hydrogen bonding distances and angles at the active site of the enzyme are listed in Table 3. Continuous electron density between the Ser195 Og atom and the carbonyl carbon atom of the Ê inhibitor (re®ned bond distance 1.34 A) is observed, indicating that 7-HC has reacted with chymotrypsin, yielding a covalently bound 2,4 dihydroxycinnamic acid ester (Figure 2(a)). The aromatic ring of the inhibitor lies in the S1 pocket of the enzyme, with the two hydroxyl groups interacting with the residues lining the pocket. The electron density corresponding to the hydroxyl group at C2 is well-de®ned, whereas the electron density corresponding to the hydroxyl group at C4 indicates the presence of disorder (Figure 2(b)). The electron density for the aromatic ring also suggests

the presence of disorder and the presence of multiple conformations for the inhibitor side-chain when bound in the S1 pocket. The electron density corresponding to the carbonyl oxygen atom also suggests the presence of disorder, as there is extra electron density surrounding the carbonyl oxygen (Figure 2(b)).

This may be due to an average of multiple orientations of the carbonyl oxygen atom in the oxyanion hole. To test this assumption, the inhibitor model was also re®ned with two alternate orientations of carbonyl oxygen atom. Re®nement results show that the carbonyl oxygen atom may ®t in the density in at least two possible orien-

tations, one pointing away from the oxyanion hole and the other closer to ®tting in the hole. When re®ned in a single conformation, the carbonyl oxygen atom of the inhibitor occupies a position near the oxyanion hole. The extended shape of the electron density for the carbonyl oxygen atom may re¯ect the presence of a mixture of acylated and deacylated enzymes in the crystal. As a result, the electron density may re¯ect the averaging of a mixture of structures in which the carbonyl oxygen atom is pointing in and out of the oxyanion hole. In the modeled orientation, the contact distances between the carbonyl oxygen atom and the main-chain nitrogen atoms of Ser195 and Ê Ê Gly193 are 3.40 A and 2.99 A, respectively. The electron density for the inhibitor also supports the presence of a double bond between the carbon atoms (C7 and C8) adjacent to the ester linkage, although the electron density is somewhat extended around the aromatic ring (perhaps signifying the presence of alternate conformations). The presence of a double bond in the 7-HC complex is consistent with X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies of related 2-pyrone complexes, which also demonstrate the presence of a double bond adjacent to the ester linkage.15,16 The stereochemistry about the double bond is clearly trans (Figure 2(b)), which implies that this bond must have isomerized from the cis conformation seen in the free coumarin inhibitor. The isomerization reaction is expected to be very slow at room temperature, and this perhaps explains in part the high value of the IC50 (0.78 mM) observed for this inhibitor.

The presence of the aromatic ring of the inhibitor in the S1 pocket of chymotrypsin is also consistent with previous kinetic data on the speci®city of coumarin inhibitors..17-19 Numerous hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions stabilize the aromatic ring in the pocket (Table 3 and Figure 3). Gly216 O and Ser217 N and O interact with the hydroxyl group at C4 of the inhibitor. The other hydroxyl group (at C2) forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen atom of Val227. Both faces of the ring are stabilized by van der Waals contacts with atoms of the peptide backbone. The closest contacts to the ring involve atoms from residues 190-195 and 213-217. These two stretches of peptide ¯ank the opposite sides of the phenyl ring, forming a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates the ring in the pocket.20 Mechanism of inhibition 7-HC appears to follow a mechanism of inhibition similar to that of the coumarins and related inhibitors of serine proteinases.15,21 ± 23 The mechanism of inhibition involves the nucleophilic attack of Ser195 Og on the carbonyl carbon atom of the inhibitor, followed by the formation of a tetrahedral transition state leading to the acyl-enzyme derivative. In the native enzyme, the Ne2 atom of His57 of the catalytic triad is in close proximity to Ê the nucleophilic serine (3.21 A between Ser195 Og e2 d1 and His57 N atoms), and N donates a hydrogen bond to Asp102. The four atoms bonded to the carbonyl carbon, are proposed to acquire a tetrahedral

523 The most important difference between the cinnamic acid complexes and the 7-HC complex is that the cinnamic acids bind to the active site of chymotrypsin in a non-productive conformation such that the carbonyl oxygen atom points away from the oxyanion hole. In contrast, the carbonyl oxygen atom of the 7-HC complex points towards the oxyanion hole, thus suggesting that 7-HC binds to the active site in a more productive orientation and progresses through a tetrahedral transition state before the formation of the acyl-enzyme derivative. The 7-HC complex has an additional hydrogen bonding interaction between the hydroxyl group para to the side-chain of the cinnamic acid and the Ser217 main-chain oxygen atom in the S1 pocket (Figure 3). This interaction likely further stabilizes the phenyl ring of the inhibitor in the S1 pocket and perhaps assists in the formation of a more productive binding conformation. By revealing the mechanism of inhibition, the structure of the 7-HC complex suggests how more potent coumarinic inhibitors may be designed to inhibit medically important chymotrypsin-like proteinases, thus complementing extensive structureactivity studies already under way.6,18,19 For example, substitutions in the aromatic ring may allow for the design of speci®c inhibitors matching the shape of the S1 pocket of the targeted enzyme. The 7-HC complex structure suggests that the mode of binding for newly designed inhibitors may bene®t from forming binding interactions with the enzyme active site that are close to that expected to be seen at the transition-state of the normal enzyme-catalyzed reaction.

arrangement in the transition state of the reaction pathway. Since the oxyanion hole (contributed by the main-chain nitrogen atoms of Gly193 and Ser195) plays a key role in stabilizing the transition state, the presence of the carbonyl oxygen atom in the proximity of the oxyanion hole is consistent with the formation of a tetrahedral transition state. However, the orientation of the carbonyl oxygen atom could not be modeled precisely, as the extended shape of the electron density suggests the presence of a mixture of acylated and deacylated enzymes in the crystal. Comparison with o-hydroxymethyl cinnamate complexes Since the 7-HC acyl-enzyme derivative is an ester of cinnamic acid, the structures of two photoreversible cinnamic acids (p-nitrophenyl o-hydroxy-a-methyl cinnamate and p-nitrophenyl o-hydroxy-p-(diethylamino)-a-methylcinnamate) covalently bound to chymotrypsin provide an interesting comparison.22 Both of the previously studied inhibitors bind to the chymotrypsin active site in an orientation similar to that of 7-HC. There are no signi®cant differences in the positioning of the sidechains of the catalytic triad residues compared to the 7-HC complex. The Ser195 Og atom forms an ester linkage with the carbonyl carbon atom of the photoreversible inhibitors, and the phenyl ring lies in the S1 pocket of the enzyme. The carbonyl carbon atom adopts a trigonal con®guration, as observed in the 7-HC complex. However, the carbonyl oxygen atoms of both the inhibitors are clearly pointing away from the oxyanion hole (Figure 4).

Structure of -Chymotrypsin with 7-Hydroxycoumarin

Materials and Methods
Isolation of 7-HC and inhibition assay 7-HC was isolated from Daphne oleoides (whole plant) and the chemical structure was con®rmed by NMR as reported elsewhere.24 Chymotrypsin inhibitory activity of 7-HC was determined by the method of Cannell et al.25 The IC50 of the inhibitor was 0.78 mM. Crystallization of g -chymotrypsin a-Chymotrypsin was ®rst converted to g-chymotrypsin. Crystals of g-chymotrypsin were grown from 52 % (w/v) saturated ammonium sulfate as precipitant containing 10 mg/ml of enzyme, 0.1 M sodium-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) and dioxane (2.5 %, v/v) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature.22 Drops of 10 ml volume were set up by mixing equal volumes of enzyme and reservoir solutions. After 24 hours the drops were seeded with microseeds of g-chymotrypsin crystals. Tetragonal crystals belonging to space group P42212 appeared in three days and grew to an average size of 0.35 mm Â 0.4 mm Â 0.5 mm in about a week. Crystals were ®rst gradually adapted to the inhibitor solution for about two to three hours and then allowed to soak for one month with periodic exchange of solution containing 20 mM of fresh inhibitor. Data collection and refinements X-ray diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a DIP 2030H image plate detector (Mac Science Co., Ltd) mounted on a rotating anode X-ray generator (Rigaku, Japan) operating at 45 kV and 75 mA using Ê CuKa radiation (l  1.5418 A). The crystal-to-detector distance was 120 mm. Diffraction data were processed using Denzo and reduced with Scalepack.26 The re®nement of the 7-HC-chymotrypsin complex was initiated using the model of native g-chymotrypsin (PDB code 1GCT).27 Since the native g-chymotrypsin contains a cleaved tetrapeptide product bound in the active site, careful examination of the electron density was performed to con®rm the absence of the bound peptide in the 7-HC-chymotrypsin complex. The peptide was removed from the model at the start of re®nement. A set of distance and angle restraints for the inhibitor was derived from the crystal structures of cinnamic acids (Cambridge Structural Database codes: BUWKUZ, BUTEIN, CEJDAW and BIDMOQ). The complete model was subjected to rigid body minimization using CNS (v. 1.0)28 and the Sigma-A weighted 2jFoj À jFcj and jFoj À jFcj Fourier maps were calculated using x®t.29 Water molecules and sulfate ions were added to the model after several rounds of individual atom positional and temperature factor re®nement using CNS. The Rfree value was followed in each re®nement cycle to monitor the progress of re®nement and to avoid over®tting. PDB accession codes Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank under accession code 1K2I.
