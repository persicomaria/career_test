Atomic structure of the Serratia marcescens Ê endonuclease at 1.1 A resolution and the enzyme reaction mechanism
The three-dimensional crystal structure of Serratia marcescens Ê endonuclease has been re®ned at 1.1 A resolution to an R factor of 12.9% and an Rfree of 15.6% with the use of anisotropic temperature factors. The model contains 3694 non-H atoms, 715 water molecules, four sulfate ions and two Mg2+-binding sites at the active sites of the homodimeric protein. It is shown that the magnesium ion linked to the active-site Asn119 of each monomer is surrounded by ®ve water molecules and shows an octahedral coordination geometry. The temperature factors for the bound Mg2+ ions Ê in the A and B subunits are 7.08 and 4.60 A2, respectively, and the average temperature factors for the surrounding water Ê molecules are 12.13 and 10.3 A2, respectively. In comparison with earlier structures, alternative side-chain conformations are de®ned for 51 residues of the dimer, including the essential active-site residue Arg57. A plausible mechanism of enzyme function is proposed based on the high-resolution S. marcescens nuclease structure, the functional characteristics of the natural and mutational forms of the enzyme and consideration of its structural analogy with homing endonuclease I-PpoI.

1. Introduction
Investigation of the primary, secondary, tertiary and quarternary structures of enzymes is aimed primarily at providing a better understanding of the role of the oligomeric and spatial arrangement, the packing of partial regular forms (such as 310 helices, distorted helices and -sheets) and amino-acid sequences in the realisation of the chemical mechanism of the function of the enzyme molecule. This, in turn, leads to the identi®cation of catalytically important active-site residues, analysis of their reactive states and dynamics of interrelation, their mutual topographic orientation at the individual protein loci and the three-dimensional protein globule in its entirety. In the past few years, the efforts of many enzymologists have been directed towards the study of the new family of structurally related magnesium-dependent endodepolymerases from different species of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms which catalyze the cleavage of nucleic acids between the 5H phosphate and 3H oxygen of the sugar moiety and are able to degrade both single-stranded and doublestranded DNA and RNA with similar ef®ciency without particular sequence preferences. The S. marcescens (Sm) endonuclease (E.C. 3.1.30.2) is a typical example of this protein family and is the only enzyme that has been extensively studied biochemically for which structural information is available (Guynn et al., 1998).

research papers
Some time ago, highly ordered crystal forms of Sm nuclease suitable for X-ray studies were grown by two independent groups of investigators (Miller et al., 1991; Bannikova et al., 1991) and the enzyme's three-dimensional structure was Ê solved at 2.1 A using isomorphous replacement (Miller et al., Ê 1994) and was then re®ned at 1.7 A resolution (Lunin et al., 1997). More recently, the magnesium-binding site was located in the protein (Miller et al., 1999) and it was shown that the active site of Sm nuclease contains several residues which are conserved in homologous proteins. The role of these residues in the catalytic mechanism of nucleic acid cleavage has been analyzed by detailed biochemical and mutational analyses (Filimonova et al., 1994; Friedhoff, Kolmes et al., 1996; Friedhoff, Meiss et al., 1996). X-ray diffraction studies of Sm nuclease, however, involved only free enzyme which did not contain any bound substrate. Therefore, information on the catalytic groups of the enzyme's active site was scarce and limited to indirect data; this was a principal cause of the proposal of mutually exclusive mechanisms of Sm nuclease catalysis with different amino-acid residues involved in the reaction (Miller et al., 1994, 1999; Lunin et al., 1997; Friedhoff, Meisss et al., 1996). Here, we Ê present the re®nement of the Sm nuclease structure at 1.1 A resolution, describe the enzyme's active site, analyze previously published results on the biochemical properties of the wild-type enzyme and its mutational analogues, draw an analogy to the structurally similar homing endonuclease and propose the most likely mechanism of enzyme action.

2. Materials and methods
The prismatic crystals of dimensions 0.7 Â 0.3 Â 0.2 mm used for high-resolution X-ray data collection and analysis were obtained as described previously (Bannikova et al., 1991). X-ray data were collected using a MAR image-plate system at the BW7B wiggler beamline of DORIS/DESY, Hamburg, Germany. The crystals were directly frozen in an N2 gas stream at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream. Glycerol [25%(v/v)] was used as a cryoprotectant. The diffraction data were processed using the program DENZO (Otwinowski, 1993). The crystal structure of Sm nuclease was re®ned using all Ê data in the resolution range 20±1.1 A. The anisotropic version of the REFMAC program was used (Murshudov et al., 1997). Stages of re®nement alternated with inspection of the Fourier synthesis and manual correction of the model using FRODO (Jones, 1978). The ®nal crystallographic R factor for all re¯ections was 12.9% (Rfree = 15.6%). Inspection of the structure of the nuclease using PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) did not display serious errors. The data-collection and re®nement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The main-chain protein folding is almost identical to that in Ê the 1.7 A model (Lunin et al., 1997), but 51 amino-acid residues (25 in the A subunit and 26 in the B subunit), including the catalytically important Arg57, have alternative side-chain conformations. The model contains 715 water molecules (131 in alternative conformations); there are no water molecules

Ê with B factors of greater then 55 A2. The model contains two 2+ Mg ions with full occupancy (one in each subunit). Modelling of DNA binding by Sm nuclease and the superposition of the structure of the Sm nuclease on the structure of I-PpoI homing endonuclease (PDB code 1a73; Flick et al., 1998) was carried out using FRODO and Swiss-PdbViewer (Guex & Petsch, 1997) in a similar way to that described previously (Miller et al., 1999).

3. Results and discussion
According to the ®nal model of Sm nuclease, the values of the torsion angles 9 and 2 calculated with PROCHECK for the main chain are found in the allowed regions and all non-Gly residues adopt most favourable or allowed conformations. The model satis®es all the stereochemical requirements generally applied to high-resolution structures. The residues Ala10 and Asn177 are involved in -turns, which are nowadays also considered to be allowed conformations (Hutchinson & Thornton, 1996). It should be noted that Ala10 is located in a short loop (Cys-Ala-Val-Gly-Cys) which is stabilized by a disul®de bridge between the Cys residues and by the hydrogen bonds Cys9 OÁ Á ÁVal11 N, Val11 OÁ Á ÁGly221 N and Gly12 OÁ Á ÁAla220 N. As indicated by statistical analysis (Bosharov, 1997), Asn residues are more often found in the correct part of the Ramachandran map than other residues. Ê As re®nement of the Sm nuclease structure at 1.7 A allowed us to describe more authentically the secondary structure of Sm nuclease (Lunin et al., 1997), in this paper re®nement of Ê the enzyme structure at 1.1 A lets us describe the enzyme molecule much more precisely. In contrast to earlier papers, the structure was re®ned using anisotropic approximation. Alternative conformations were de®ned for 51 residues in the nuclease dimer; it is important that alternative conformations

for the active-site residue Arg57 in both subunits were de®ned. The model also contains four sulfate ions, including the free sulfate ion in the active site of each subunit hydrogen bonded to the Mg2+±water cluster. According to the present data, the structure of Sm nuclease reveals essential inner symmetry. The protein secondary structure can be divided into three regions: a central -sheet formed by six antiparallel -strands, which is ¯anked by an -domain consisting of four short -helices and joining the Nand C-terminal parts of the molecule on one side, and an / conformational domain forming the upper layer of the globule, which consists of a double-stranded -sheet embraced by a symmetrical system of eight helical fragments (Fig. 1). Ê The re®ned structure of Sm nuclease dimer at 1.1 A resolution contains 3694 non-H atoms and 715 water molecules (131 in alternative conformations). Two Mg2+ ion binding sites are localized at the surface of the molecule within the / conformational domain and are shielded from behind by a central six-stranded -sheet (Fig. 1). The Mg2+ ion acts as metal ion cofactor, makes contact directly with the side-chain O atom (OD1) of Asn119, shows an octahedral coordination geometry and is surrounded by ®ve water molecules. The coordination distances for the water molecules and Ê Asn119 OD1 are in the range 2.02±2.11 A. The temperature 2+ factors for the bound Mg ions in the A and B subunits are Ê 7.08 and 4.60 A2, respectively, and the average temperature factors for surrounding water molecules and the Asn119 OD1 Ê atom are 12.13 and 10.3 A2, respectively. Both sites are fully occupied and well de®ned in the 2Fo À Fc electron-density map (Fig. 2). The principal goal of the Sm nuclease investigation is the clari®cation of the chemical mechanism of enzyme action and primarily involves identifying those amino-acid residues that are responsible in the framework of general acid/base catalysis for the activation of the water molecule which attacks the phosphodiester bond, the stabilization of the transition state and the promotion of the protonation of the nucleotide leaving group. Based on structural and enzymological investigations, the enzyme DNA/RNA-binding cleft is located between the two main structural domains of the protein and the active site is formed by the invariant residues Arg57, Asp86, Arg87, His89, Asn119 and Arg131, several of which were thought to play important roles in the enzyme's catalytic function (Miller et al., 1994, 1999; Lunin et al., 1997; Friedhoff, Kolmes et al., 1996; Friedhoff, Meiss et al., 1996). We have suggested previously that Asp86 is involved in the chelation of the magnesium ion and that Glu127 acts as a general Lewis base for the activation of the water molecule (Lunin et al., 1997), while Pingoud and coworkers have concluded that Glu127 interacts with the active-site magnesium and that His89 plays the role of general base (Friedhoff, Kolmes et al., 1996; Friedhoff, Meiss et al., 1996). Along with the Mg2+±water cluster coordinated to Asn119, there are seven nearby amino-acid residues in the active site of Sm nuclease, including Arg57, Asp86, His89, Gln114 and Glu127 (Fig. 3), and additionally Asn106 and Gln120 (not shown); the former are conserved in the family of homologous proteins, while the latter are variable. From the results of the nuclease structure re®nement, it is now clear that Asn106 interacts with His89 and that the Figure 1 carbonyl O atom of Asn106 and His89 NE2 are hydrogen The secondary structure of the Sm nuclease monomer.

In turn, Gln120 ND2 is involved in a hydrogen bond water cluster (magenta Mg2+ and red water molecules) and active-site to Asp86 OD2, whereas Asp86 OD1 participates in hydrogen residues His89, Asn119 and Glu127 (green) are shown. bonding to the side chain of Asn119. The remainder of the above-mentioned residues are linked by hydrogen bonds to the coordinating water molecules. For example, one of the Glu127 carboxylate O atoms is hydrogen bonded to H2Ob and the other is bonded to H2Od; Asn119 OD1, in addition to coordinating to the Mg2+ atom, is hydrogen bonded to H2Oa and H2Oc, while H2Od interacts with the mainchain carbonyl O atom of Asn119.

Such a combination of interactions is necessary in order to provide binding and correct positioning of the Mg2+ cofactor and the relative location of the enzyme's catalytically important residues. From a structural viewpoint, in addition to Asn119, there are at least three further residues important for enzyme activity, namely Arg57, His89 and Glu127, which are not only located in close proximity to each other, but mutagenesis of

any one of them results in a drastic reduction in the catalytic properties of Sm nuclease (Friedhoff, Kolmes et al., 1996; Kolmes et al., 1996), although until now their chemical function has remained under question. As has already been mentioned, in the studies of the Sm nuclease structures which have been solved crystallographically, we are dealing with the enzyme without substrate and are therefore restricted to indirect data about enzyme±substrate interactions. Ê The crystallographic structures, at 1.8 A, of intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-PpoI from Physarum polycephalum complexed with DNA from P. polycephalum (without Mg2+ ions) and its post-cleavage product (in the presence of Mg2+; Flick et al., 1998) have been published. It was shown that I-PpoI and Sm nucleases have similar biochemical properties and share quite similar active-site geometries (Miller et al., 1999; Friedhoff et al., 1999; Figs. 4a and 4b). Both enzymes bind catalytic Mg2+ ions with a single Asn119 ligand; the catalytic His89/His98 (Sm/I-PpoI), Asn119 and metal±water cluster superimpose quite well (Table 3), which suggests that DNA around the scissile bond might be bound in a similar way by Sm nuclease as by the nuclease I-PpoI. This suggestion is supported, as seen in the superimposed nuclease structures, by the close proximity of the 3H - and 5H -phosphate groups of the scissile DNA phosphodiester bond to the protein residues Arg87 and Arg131, which are invariant in the Sm nuclease family and are important for the substrate-binding and enzyme activity (Friedhoff, Kolmes et al., 1996; Flick et al., 1998; Kolmes et al., 1996). In the I-PpoI product±DNA complex, the terminal 3H -deoxyribose O atom is coordinated to the magnesium ion; if this is the case for Sm nuclease, we would expect that the 3H O atom from bound DNA occupies the position of the H2Oc molecule in the magnesium-coordinated cluster of the enzyme. The water molecule from the hydration sphere of the Mg2+ ion bound to Asn119 protonates the leaving group of the nucleotide (Fig. 3). The direct binding 3H -OH group of the substrate to the magnesium ion suggests an inner-sphere mechanism of activation by magnesium (Cowan, 1998), which is not trivial for nucleases. Asp86, Gln114 and Gln127 of Sm nuclease are indirect participants in this process; their role is probably restricted by the correct positioning of the Mg2+± water cluster. At the same time, Glu127 (as proposed previously; Lunin et al., 1997), as well as magnesium-bound water (hydroxide), cannot be involved in the Sm nuclease catalysis as the general base. The Glu127Ala mutant of Sm nuclease retains about 0.1% of the residual activity of wildtype enzyme using DNA as substrate, but cleavage of deoxythymidine 3H ,5H -bis-(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate is not at all affected by this mutation, as the protonation of the leaving group is not necessary in this case (Kolmes et al., 1996). The fact that magnesium may not be required for hydrolysis of this arti®cial nucleotide by wild-type nuclease or the Glu127Ala mutant assumes that a water molecule from the coordination sphere of the magnesium ion could indeed be the general acid which protonates the leaving group during the cleavage of nucleic acids by Sm nuclease.

From the above reasoning, it is clear that the only principal candidate for the general base function of Sm nuclease is His89. This residue cannot be a general acid in the mechanism of nucleic acid cleavage by Sm nuclease (as we assumed previously; Lunin et al., 1997), because if this were the case the His89Ala mutant should be able to hydrolyze the previously mentioned synthetic nucleotide substrate; however, it does not do so (Kolmes et al., 1996). Relying on the present data, His89 is neutral in the crystallographic structure of Sm nuclease; only the NE2 atom of His imidazole is protonated (Fig. 2) and His89 is hydrogen bonded to Asn106 and two water molecules H2Oa and H2Oe. In the structure of I-PpoI, the His residue is located optimally to position a water for an in-line attack on the phosphodiester bond to be cleaved. There are two mechanistic schemes for the participation of the His89 residue in nucleotide cleavage by Sm nuclease in which either an unligated solvent water molecule or a magnesium-bound water molecule is activated by His (Miller et al., 1999). From our point of view, it is reasonably safe to suggest that only the second mechanism, involving activation of H2Oa by His89, is realistic. This mechanism serves as a further indication of the catalytic role of Asn119 in the mechanism of phosphodiester-bond cleavage of deoxythimidine 3H ,5H -bis(p-nitrophenyl phosphate) by Sm nuclease. This nucleotide does not require protonation of its leaving group and is cleaved by wild-type enzyme without Mg2+ ion, but it is not at all affected by the Asn119Ala analogue of Sm nuclease

² H2Oc position is identical to the position of the nucleotide 3H O atom in the nuclease± substrate complex.

(Kolmes et al., 1996). This means that Asn119, even in the absence of the Mg2+±water cluster, is involved in multipoint ®xation of the water molecule attacking the phosphodiester bond and the logical deduction is made that it is the same H2Oa molecule as in the presence of the magnesium cluster. In fact, the crystallographic structures of Sm nuclease active sites in the presence or absence of magnesium cofactor are identical within the accuracy of the X-ray analysis. Moreover, in both the structure of the DNA-I±PpoI complex and the re®ned crystallographic Sm nuclease structure without Mg2+ ions the His89 (His98 in I-PpoI)±Asn119 hydrogen-bonded water molecule is observed and, moreover, occupies the same position in the active sites as the Mg2+±H2Oa cluster. In addition, the re®ned crystallographic B factors give us some indication of the ¯exibility or disorder of the protein structure. This is particularly important for the residues in the active site, because the B values will give some estimate of which residues are predestined for changes of position during the process of substrate binding and cleavage. A near-atomic resolution is suf®cient to re®ne every single atom in anisotropic mode, which was performed in this case. Arg57 of the Sm nuclease active site is rather conspicuous. The overall B factors for Arg57 as a rough approximation were doubled compared Ê with all other residues at 1.7 A resolution. Owing to the high resolution and the use of anisotropic B factors, we were able to locate the alternative conformation of its side chain. According to our data, Arg57 has alternative conformations of the side chain with occupancies 0.6 and 0.4 in both molecules of the dimer. In one conformation Arg57 is hydrogen bonded to a sulfate ion (occupancy 0.6) and in the other conformation Arg57 is bound to the Mg2+±water cluster (Fig. 4b) Figure 4 Stereoview of the active sites of I-PpoI nuclease with cleavage products complex (a) and Results of Sm nuclease±DNA binding Sm nuclease (b).

central P atom in the transition state when the anionic leaving group is departing. The reaction is accompanied by inversion of the con®guration at the P atom and occurs by an in-line mechanism, i.e. the attacking nucleophile approaches from the site opposite to the leaving group. His89 of Sm nuclease and the magnesium water cluster are directly involved in this process and the metal ion could participate in more than one of its possible roles and could serve to activate the electrophile, stabilize the transition state and protonate the leaving group.
