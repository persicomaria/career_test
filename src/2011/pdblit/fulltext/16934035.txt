Parkia platycephala lectin 2 was purified from Parkia platycephala (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae) seeds by affinity chromatography and RP-HPLC. Equilibrium sedimentation and MS showed that Parkia platycephala lectin 2 is a nonglycosylated monomeric protein of molecular mass 29 407 ± 15 Da, which contains six cysteine residues engaged in the formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Parkia platycephala lectin 2 agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes, and this activity was specifically inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine. In addition, Parkia platycephala lectin 2 hydrolyzed b(1­4) glycosidic bonds linking 2-acetoamido-2-deoxy-b-d-glucopyranose units in chitin. The full-length amino acid sequence of Parkia platycephala lectin 2, determined by N-terminal sequencing and cDNA cloning, and its three-dimensional structure, established by X-ray crystallo° graphy at 1.75 A resolution, showed that Parkia platycephala lectin 2 is homologous to endochitinases of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18, which share the (ba)8 barrel topology harboring the catalytic residues Asp125, Glu127, and Tyr182.

PPL2, an endochitinase from Parkia platycephala

Lectins comprise a heterogeneous class of (glyco)proteins that possess one noncatalytic domain that binds carbohydrates in a specific and reversible manner without altering their covalent structure [1]. Lectins decipher the glycocodes encoded in the structure of glycans in processes such as cell communication, host defense, fertilization, development, parasitic infection, tumor metastasis, and plant defense against herbivores and pathogens [2]. Mechanisms for sugar recognition have evolved independently in a restricted number of protein folds (e.g. jelly roll domain, C-type lectin fold, b-propeller, b-trefoil motif, b-prism I and II domains, Ig domains, b-sandwich, mixed ab structure, and hevein domain) [1,3] (for a complete catalog of carbohydratebinding protein domains, please consult the 3D Lectin Database at http://www.cermav.cnrs.fr/lectines). In plants, most of the currently known lectins can be placed in seven families of structurally and evolutionarily related proteins [1]. The seed lectins of leguminous plants constitute the largest and most thoroughly studied lectin family. These lectins have represented paradigms for establishing the structural basis [4­9] and thermodynamics [10­13] of selective sugar recognition. Most studies on lectins from Leguminosae involve members of the Papilionoideae subfamily, whereas investigations on lectins of the other two subfamilies, Caesalpinoideae and Mimosoideae, are scarce. Indeed, to date, the only lectins from the Mimosoideae that have been functionally and structurally characterized are those from seeds of species of the genus Parkia, including Parkia speciosa [14], Parkia javanica [15], Parkia discolor [16] and the glucose / mannose-specific lectin from Parkia platycephala seeds [17­21]. Parkia (Leguminosae, Mimosoideae), regarded as the most primitive group of leguminous plants [22], is a pantropical genus of trees comprising about 30 species found in the neotropics from Honduras to south-eastern Brazil, West Africa, the northern part of Malaysia and the south of Thailand. Parkia platycephala is an important forage tree growing in parts of north-eastern Brazil. The seed lectin from Parkia platycephala is a 47.9-kDa single-chain nonglycosylated mosaic protein composed of three tandemly arranged jacalin-related b-prism domains [19,20]. The sugar-binding specificity of Parkia platycephala lectin towards mannose, an abundant building block of surface-exposed glycoconjugates of viruses, bacteria, and fungi, suggests a role for the Parkia platycephala lectin in defense against plant pathogens [1]. Moreover, the Parkia platycephala lectin also shows sequence similarity with stress-upregulated and pathogen-upregulated defense genes of a number of different plants, suggesting a common ancestry for jacalin-related

lectins and inducible defense proteins [19]. In addition to using lectins, whose precise role in plant defense remains to be determined [23,24, and references cited], plants defend themselves against pathogens (i.e. fungi) secreting pathogenesis-related enzymes, such as xylanases and chitinases, which degrade the pathogen's cell wall [25­27]. In a previous article we have reported the presence of an endochitinase in Parkia platycephala seeds [28]. Now, we have determined its complete amino acid sequence by a combination of Edman degradation and cDNA cloning, and report its biochemical characterization and the determination of its crystal structure. Our results show that this protein, termed Parkia platycephala lectin 2 (PPL2), is homologous to endochitinases of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 that exhibit rabbit erythrocyte-agglutinating, N-acetylglucosamine-binding and chitin-hydrolyzing activities.

Results and Discusion
PPL2, a nonglycosylated and monomeric GlcNAc-binding hemagglutinin PPL2 was purified from Parkia platycephala seeds by affinity chromatography on either Red-Sepharose (Fig. 1A) or chitin-Sepharose. The protein agglutinated trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes (128 hemagglutinating units mg)1), and this activity was abolished by 19 mm N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNac). Other sugars, such as glucose, mannose, galactose, fucose and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, displayed only partial hemagglutination inhibitory activity at much higher concentrations (> 75 mm) than GlcNac. Moreover, the glycoproteins bovine thyroglobulin, ovine submaxillary mucin, bovine fetuin and bovine asialofetuin were devoid of hemagglutination inhibitory activity. Bovine thyroglobulin contains nine complex glycosylation sites and four high-mannose oligosaccharides [29]. Ovine submaxillary mucin is a glycoprotein bearing a high density of O-linked oligosaccharides expressing sialyl Tn antigens and sialyl core 3 sequences [30]. Bovine fetuin contains three N-linked glycosylation sites occupied with trisialylated, tetrasialylated or pentasialylated trianntennary structures, and three monosialylated or disialylated O-linked saccharides [31­33]. We thus concluded that PPL2 represented an N-acetylglucosamine-binding hemagglutinin. The apparent molecular masses of both native and reduced PPL2 determined by SDS / PAGE were 30 kDa (Fig. 1A, insert). The molecular mass of native PPL2, measured by MALDI-TOF MS, was 29 407 ± 15 Da (Fig. 1A). This value was not altered upon incubation of the denatured, but nonreduced,

protein with the alkylating reagent 4-vinylpyridine. On the other hand, the same treatment after reduction of the protein with dithiothreitol changed the molecular mass of PPL2 to 30 052 ± 15 Da (Fig. 1B). The mass increment of about 645 Da indicated that PPL2 had incorporated six pyridylethyl groups. The combined data clearly showed that PPL2 contained six cysteine residues engaged in the formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Amino acid compositional analysis of the purified protein (Table 1) was in agreement with this conclusion. The estimated apparent molecular mass for PPL2 on a calibrated size-exclusion chromatographic column was 12 kDa, indicating that the protein had an anomalous elution profile. Molecular mass determinations by size-exclusion chromatography are dependent on the hydrodynamic properties of the molecule, and, in addition, interaction of the protein with the matrix may also introduce large errors into the estimated molecular mass. Thus, we carried out a more rigorous analysis of the aggregation state of PPL2 employing

analytic ultracentrifugation equilibrium sedimentation, a technique that is firmly based in thermodynamics and does not therefore rely on calibration or on making assumptions concerning the shape of the protein. Using this approach, the apparent molecular mass of the PPL2 lectin in solutions with pH in the range 2.5­ 8.5 was 34 ± 3 kDa (Fig. 1B, insert). This figure, in conjunction with the MS analyses, showed that the protein behaved as a pH-independent monomeric protein. Carbohydrate analysis performed by GLC (data not shown) failed to show the presence of any amino or neutral monosaccharide, strongly indicating that PPL2 was a nonglycosylated protein. PPL2 displays chitinase activity Edman degradation analysis of reduced and pyridylethylated protein yielded the first 42 amino acid residues of PPL2: GGIVVYWGQNGGEGTLTSTCESGL YQIVNIAFLSQFGGGRRP. A blast analysis (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) revealed extensive (up to approximately 75%) similarity with a large number of plant chitinase sequences deposited in the publicly accessible protein databases, such as the basic chitinase III from Nicotiana tabacum (P29061), an acidic chitinase from Glycine max (BAA77677), chitinase b from Phytolacca americana (Q9S9F7), chitinase from Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (BAA08708), chitinases from Vitis vinifera (CAC14014), basic chitinase from Vigna unguiculata (Q43684), and chitinase B from leaves of pokeweed (Q9S9F7). All of these proteins are poly [1,4-(N-acetyl-b-d-glucosaminide)] glycanhydrolases of the glycosyl hydrolase family 18 (EC 3.2.1.14) [34] (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00704), whose prototype is hevamine, isolated from the rubber tree [35,36]. The possible chitinase activity of PPL2 was investigated by quantitative GC determination of the amount of GlcNac released using chitin as substrate. PPL2 released 3 lg of GlcNacÆh)1Æ(mg protein))1. In comparison, commercial Streptomyces griseus chitinase exhibited an activity of 80 lg of GlcNacÆh)1Æ(mg protein))1, and the GlcNac-specific agglutinins from wheat germ (WGA) and Urtica dioica (UDA) did not show any chitinase activity. Peracetylated GlcNac (retention time 33.60 min) was observed in the reaction mixtures containing PPL2 or Streptomyces griseus chitinase but not in those reaction mixtures to which WGA or UDA were added. These results demonstrated that PPL2 was indeed an active chitinase able to hydrolyze the b(1­4) glycosidic bond linking the GlcNac units of chitin. In order to determine whether PPL2 presented chitinase

activity only for the nonreducing end of chitin (exochitinase activity) or also had the ability to hydrolyze internal b(1­4) glycosidic linkages (an endochitinase activity), 40 lL of the reaction mixture used for the chitinase assay were analyzed by Dionex high-pH anion exchange chromatography using a CarboPac PA-100 column. The elution times of three major analytes present in the reaction mixture (3.93, 4.84 and 5.58 min) matched those of the standard carbohydrates GlcNac, (GlcNac)2 and (GlcNac)3 (3.86, 4.84 and 5.58 min, respectively). This result demonstrated an endochitinase activity for PPL2. The exact mechanism of glycoside hydrolysis (e.g. with retention or not of the b-anomeric configuration of the products) remains to be established, however. The finding that PPL2 exhibited GlcNac-dependent hemagglutination and endochitinase activities was striking but not without precedent. The acidic chitinase BjCHI1 from Brassica juncea showed hemagglutination ability [37]. However, BjCHI1 is a unique chitinase with two chitin-binding domains, and both chitin-binding domains are essential for agglutination [38]. On the other hand, PPL2 is a single-domain protein. Hence, PPL2 may possess at least two carbohydrate-binding sites. One of them probably corresponds to the catalytic site, whereas the other one(s) remain to be characterized. Plant chitinases constitute a class of pathogenesisrelated proteins that play an important role in defense against pathogens through degradation of chitin present in the fungal cell wall and in insect cuticles [37,39]. The first characterization of a chitinase in the Mimosoideae subtribe, an antifungal chitinase from Leucaena leucocephala has been reported only recently [40]. This protein belongs to the class I chitinases of the glycosyl hydrolase family 19, and is, thus, structurally unrelated to PPL2. It is noteworthy that the seeds of Parkia platycephala contain two different lectins: the mannose / glucose-specific PPL1 [19,21] and the GlcNac-binding lectin with chitinase activity, PPL2, described here. The fact that mannose is an abundant building block of surface-exposed glycoconjugates of viruses, bacteria and fungi supports the view that PPL, and other mannose-recognizing lectins, play a role in plant defense against pathogens [1]. Specifically, the planar array of carbohydrate-binding sites on the rim of the toroid-shaped structure of the Parkia platycephala lectin dimer [21] immediately suggested a mechanism to promote multivalent interactions leading to crosslinking of carbohydrate ligands as part of the host strategy against phytopredators and pathogens. The presence of two unrelated lectins in plant seeds has

been also reported in Canavalia ensiformis (Leguminosae): concanavalin A, a prototypic glucose / mannosespecific legume lectin built by the jellyroll fold [1,7], and concanavalin B, which, although it shares about 40% sequence identity with plant chitinases belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 18, has not been shown to have any chitinase activity [41]. The lack of chitinase activity of concanavalin B can be explained by differences in the loops that form the substrate-binding cleft [42]. Sequencing of cDNA and genomic DNA for PPL2 Conserved amino acid sequences from glycosyl hydrolase family 18 were used to design two degenerate primers that allowed us to PCR-amplify a specific product of approximately 500 bp (pPPL2). Its sequence was then used to design a gene-specific forward primer (GSPPPL2) to extend the sequence analysis of the PPL2 cDNA by 3¢RACE. Using the GSP-PPL2 and Qo primers, the sequence was extended in the 3¢ direction by PCR walking. From these sequences (pPPL2 and 3¢RACE), two specific primers (PPL2f and PPL2r) were designed that amplified a fragment of 800 bp corresponding to the stretch between the conserved N-terminal sequence 6YWGQNGG12 and the STOP codon

(Fig. 2). Using primers designed from the cDNA sequence, the PPL2 gene was amplified from genomic DNA of Parkia platycephala seedlings. The size of the amplified genomic DNA was identical to that of the cDNA, indicating that the PPL2 gene was devoid of introns, as observed for other class III chitinase genes [43]. The complete amino acid sequence of PPL2 determined by the combination of N-terminal sequencing and cDNA cloning contains 271 amino acid residues, including the six conserved cysteine residues of class III chitinases, and the putative catalytic residues of class III plant chitinases, which in PPL2 correspond to amino acid positions 125 (Asp) and 127 (Glu). The calculated isotope-averaged molecular mass of the PPL2 sequence is 29 490.1 Da, which is about 86 ± 15 Da greater than the molecular mass determined by MALDI-TOF MS, suggesting that the native protein may lack the C-terminal valine residue. Overall three-dimensional structure of PPL2 Figure 3 displays the structure of PPL2. The 2Fo ) Fc density map contoured at 1r showed that, with the exception of a small loop between the a4 and b5 regions corresponding to residues from Asn144 to Lys149, the majority of the protein residues were well

PPL2 structure consists of a compact (b / a)8 barrel ° with dimensions of approximately 50 · 40 · 25 A, including three disulfide bonds (Cys20­Cys67, Cys50­ Cys57 and Cys158­Cys187) and five cis peptide bonds. Two of the cis peptide bonds of PPL2 (Gly147­Lys148 and Lys148­Lys149) are located in a region of poor density, whereas the remaining three (Ala31­Phe32, Phe160­Pro161 and Trp253­Asp254) are well defined at the electron density. With the exception of four sulfate ions (Fig. 4), which presumably remained bound to PPL2 throughout its purification protocol, as the protein was precipitated by ammonium sulfate to separate it from pigments, no metal ions or ligands were detected. Sulfate ions were assigned according to Copley and Barton [44].

xylanase inhibitor XIP-I from Triticum aestivum (1TE1), and ConB (Canavalia ensiformis) (1CNV), with which PPL2 shares 68%, 40% and 40% sequence similarity, respectively (Fig. 4A). The threedimensional structure of PPL2 can be superimposed onto those of hevamine, XIP-I and ConB, with root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for all Ca atoms of ° ° ° 0.90 A, 1.01 A and 1.14 A, respectively. In particular, the two consensus motifs described for the glycosyl hydrolase family 18, e.g. the presence of the absolutely conserved strands b3 and b4 (Fig. 4A, boxed), and the hydrogen bond network between residues Asp120 and Gly121 and Val74 (Fig. 4A,B) [33], are also conserved in PPL2. On the other hand, the largest structural divergence is associated with the active site cleft loops, which comprise the residues linking neighbor b-strands in the (ab)8 barrel. Thus, whereas with the exception of the b6a6 loop, all the active site cleft loops of PPL2 are highly conserved in hevamine, and only few structural differences are evident when comparing the b2a2 and b7a7 loops from PPL2 and ConB, the active site cleft loops from XIP-I significantly depart from those of PPL2. The PPL2 chitin-binding site X-ray studies have suggested that enzymes of the GH18 family showing chitinase activity have conserved
3968

Asp125, Glu127 and Tyr183 amino acids (hevamine numbering) in their active sites. Their significance for catalysis is not well understood, although it has been suggested that Glu127 may act as a proton donor to the cleavable glycosidic bond, and Asp125 and Tyr183 would contribute to the stabilization of the oxazolinium intermediate [45]. In PPL2, these residues correspond to Asp125, Glu127 and Tyr182 (Figs 2 and 4A). Asp125 and Glu127 are located in the b4a4 loop, and Tyr182 at loop b6a6. The highly conserved, functionally relevant, structural features that are common to PPL2 and hevamine suggest that these two chitinases may share essentially the same catalytic mechanism. In addition, our data showing that PPL2 strongly binds GlcNac would support a hypothetical mechanism by which the lectin hydrolyzes a chitin polymer by cycles of anchoring, cleavage and being released from a GlcNac-binding site, and anchoring to another GlcNac-binding site. Clearly, detailed molecular and structural studies are required to investigate this.

temperature and kept dry for further use. Soluble proteins were extracted overnight at room temperature by continuous stirring with 1 : 15 (w / v) 500 mm HCl solution, containing 150 mm NaCl. Insoluble material was separated by centrifugation (Ultracentrifuga Beckman modelo XL-1, Palo Alto, CA) at 10 000 g for 20 min at 5 °C. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.0 and left for 12 h at 4 °C. Precipitated pigments were removed by centrifugation (Ultracentrifuga Beckman modelo XL-1), and the supernatant was subjected to precipitation with 60% saturated ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation (Ultracentrifuga Beckman modelo XL-1), the pellet was resuspended in a small volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm NaCl, dialyzed against this buffer, and subjected to affinity chromatography on a RedSepharose CL-4B column (26 · 1.5 cm) (Sigma-Aldrich, Sao ~ Paulo, Brazil) equilibrated with the same buffer as described previously for GlcNAc-specific enzymes [46]. Unbound material was eluted by washing the column with equilibration buffer, and the retained fraction was desorbed with 3 m NaCl in buffer, dialyzed against equilibrium buffer, and assayed for hemagglutinating activity following a standard procedure with trypsin-treated rabbit red blood cells [47]. To this end, a two-fold dilution was prepared for each sugar (1 m starting concentration) solution in 0.15 m NaCl containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 5 mm MnCl2. Each dilution had a final volume of 0.2 mL. The purified lectin was diluted in 0.15 m NaCl to achieve 4 units of hemagglutinating activity per mL. The lowest concentration of inhibitor exhibiting agglutinating activity was termed the minimum inhibitory concentration. Aliquots of 0.2 mL of the 4 unit solution of

the lectin were used for hemagglutination inhibition assay. Monosaccharides (mannose, glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose) and glycoproteins (bovine thyroglobulin, ovine submaxillary mucin, bovine fetuin, and asialofetuin) were tested for hemagglutination inhibitory activity.

Purification of PPL2
The protein fraction retained in the Red-Sepharose CL-4B column was further fractionated by RP-HPLC and by chitin affinity chromatography. For RP-HPLC, 3 mg of total proteins was dissolved in 250 lL of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solution A) and centrifuged (Ultracentrifuga Beckman modelo XL-1) at 4500 g for 2 min. The supernatant was applied on a lBondapack C18 analytic column (3.9 · 300 mm) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equilibrated in solution A, and the column was developed using the following chromatographic conditions: 100% buffer A for 5 min, followed by gradients of 0­30% of solution B (66.6% acetonitrile in A) for 5 min, 30­40% B for 30 min, 40­70% B for 5 min, 70­80% B for 10 min, 80­100% B for 5 min, and 100% B for 10 min. The elution was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions were collected manually, lyophilized and stored at ) 70 °C until used. For affinity chromatography, the protein fraction retained in the RedSepharose column was applied overnight to a chitin column (2 · 5 cm) (Sigma-Aldrich) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris / HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. Unbound material was eluted by washing the column with equilibration buffer,

and the retained fraction was desorbed with 50 mm Tris / HCl, 3 m NaCl, pH 7.2.

Molecular mass determinations
Tricine-PAGE in a discontinuous gel and buffer system [48] was used to estimate the apparent molecular mass of the proteins. Samples were denatured for 10 min in sample buffer containing 2.5% (w / v) SDS before electrophoresis. After the run, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G (0.2%) in methanol / acetic acid / water (4 : 1 : 6, v / v) and destained in the same solution. Protein molecular weight markers (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) were included in each run. The molecular masses of the native, reduced and carbamidomethylated proteins were determined by MALDI-TOF MS using an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA, USA) Voyager PRO-STR instrument operating at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV in the linear mode and using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mgÆmL)1 in 50% acetonitrile) as the matrix. The apparent molecular mass of the Parkia platycephala lectin 2 in solutions of different pH was determined by sizeexclusion chromatography and by analytic ultracentrifugation equilibrium sedimentation using a Beckman XL-A centrifuge with UV absorption scanner optics. For sizeexclusion chromatography, PPL2 (2 mgÆmL)1) was applied ¨ to a Superose-12 HR10 / 30 column connected to an AKTA HPLC system (GE-Healthcare Bioscience). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 mLÆmin)1. Elution was monitored at 280 nm. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were carried out at 20 °C and 13 000 r.p.m. using an AN-50 Ti rotor. The protein was dissolved at about 0.1 mgÆmL)1 in the following buffers, each containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Cl2Mn, and 1 mm Cl2Ca: 20 mm sodium citrate pH 2.5; 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 3.5; 20 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5; 20 mm Mes, pH 5.5; 20 mm Mes, pH 6.5; 20 mm Tris / HCl, pH 7.5; and 20 mm Tris / HCl, pH 8.5.

´ (Millipore Iberica S.A., Madrid, Spain) after activation with 70% acetonitrile (ACN) and equilibration in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Following protein adsorption and washing with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, the PE-protein was eluted onto the MALDI-TOF plate with 1 lL of 70% ACN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to MS analysis as above. The number of free cysteine residues (NSH) was determined from Eqn (1): NSH ¼ ðMPE À MNAT Þ=105:1 ð1Þ

where MPE is the mass of the denatured but nonreduced protein incubated in the presence of 4-vinylpyridine, MNAT is the mass of the native, HPLC-isolated protein, and 105.1 is the mass increment (in Da) due to the pyridylethylation of one thiol group. The number of total cysteine residues (NCys) can be calculated from Eqn (2): NCys ¼ ðMAlk À MNAT Þ=105:1 ð2Þ

where MAlk is the mass (in Da) of the fully reduced and alkylated protein. Finally, the number of disulfide bonds NS­S can be calculated from Eqn (3): NSÀS ¼ ðNcys À NSH Þ=2 ð3Þ

Amino acid analysis and N-terminal amino acid sequence determination
Amino acid analysis was performed on a Pico-Tag amino acid analyzer (Waters) as described [49]. One nanomole of purified protein was hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl / 1% phenol at 106 °C for 24 h. The hydrolyzate was reacted with 20 lL of fresh derivatization solution (methanol / triethylamine / water / phenylisothiocyanate, 7 : 1 : 1 : 1, v / v) for 1 h at room temperature, and the phenylisothiocyanate (PTC)-amino acids were identified and quantitated on an RP-HPLC column calibrated with a mixture of standard PTC-amino acids (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Cysteine residues were determined as cysteic acid. N-terminal sequencing of reduced and carboxymethylated proteins was performed in an Applied Biosystems model Procise 491 gas­liquid protein sequencer. The phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives of the amino acids were identified with an Applied Biosystems model 450 microgradient PTH analyzer.

Quantitation of free cysteine residues and disulfide bonds
For quantitation of free cysteine residues and disulfide bonds, the purified proteins dissolved in 10 lL of 50 mm Hepes, pH 9.0, 5 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 1 mm EDTA were heat-denatured at 85 °C for 15 min, allowed to cool at room temperature, and incubated with either 10 mm 4-vinylpyridine for 15 min at room temperature, or with 10 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 80 °C; this was followed by addition of 4-vinylpyridine at 25 mm final concentration and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. The pyridylethylated (PE) protein was freed from reagents using a C18 Zip-Tip pipette tip

Genomic DNA and RNA isolation, and cDNA cloning
Genomic DNA from fresh leaves of 2-week-old seedlings of Parkia platycephala grown from mature seeds was extracted using the cetyl triethylammonium bromide (CTAB) procedure [50].

PPL2, an endochitinase from Parkia platycephala

For RNA isolation, young Parkia platycephala buds were immediately ground to a powder with a pestle in liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was isolated with Concert Plant RNA reagent (Invitrogen S.A., Barcelona, Spain). Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription using oligo-dT17 and MMLV reverse transcriptase ´ (Promega Biotech Iberica, Madrid, Spain). Degenerated primers were designed from conserved amino acid sequences of plant chitinases YWGQNGG and WVQFY NNP (sense primer 5¢-TAY TGG GAR AAY GGN GG-3¢, and antisense primer 5¢-GG RTT RTT RTA RAA YTG NAC CCA-3¢; the nomenclature follows the IUPAC code for degeneracies). PCR amplification was performed with 1 U (International unit) of Taq DNA polymerase (HF, Roche Diagnostics S.L., Barcelona, Spain) using the following conditions: DNA was denatured at 94 °C for 4 min, and this was followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), annealing (30 s at 50 °C) and extension (30 s at 72 °C), followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Invitrogen). The inserted DNA fragments were subjected to sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 377 DNA sequencing system using T7 and SP6 primers, and this sequence was used for designing specific oligonucleotides for completing the sequence by 3¢RACE. 3¢RACE was done as described [51] using the Qt primer (5¢-CCA GTG AGC AGA GTG ACG AGG ACT CGA GCT CAA GCT16-3¢) for reverse transcription, and the sense primer GSP-PPL2 (5¢-CTG CTG CAC CAC AAT GTC CTT TTC-3¢) and the antisense primer Qo (5¢-CCA GTG AGC AGA GTG ACG-3¢) for PCR amplification. The 3¢RACE reaction conditions were as those for cDNA amplification, except that annealing was done at 60 °C. Using this information, two specific primers were designed, PPL2-forward (5¢-TAT TGG GGC CAG AAT GGA G-3¢) and PPL2reverse (5¢-TCAA ACA CTG GGC TTA ATT TTG G-3¢) for amplifying and sequencing the full-length ORF of PPL2.

Assay for chitinase activity
Chitinase enzymatic assays were performed in Pyrex tubes (7 mL) with Teflon-lined screw caps. The reaction mixtures (total 1250 lL) contained 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), 5 mg of washed chitin powder (blank), and either 25 lL of a PPL2 solution (1 mgÆmL)1) or 10 lL (0.5 lU) of Streptomyces griseus family 19 chitinase (Sigma) (one unit will liberate 1.0 mg of GlcNac from chitin per hour at pH 6.0 at 25 °C in a 2 h assay) as positive control, both in sodium acetate buffer. The negative control consisted of the same reaction mixture, except that sodium acetate buffer replaced the protein sample. Twenty-five microliters of 1 mgÆmL)1 solutions of two GlcNac-specific lectins, the agglutinins from wheat germ (WGA) and Urtica dioica (UDA), which are devoid of chitinase activity, were also included in the assays as specificity controls. For calibration

and quantitation, a mixture of 1 lg of each, mannose and GlcNac in sodium acetate buffer was used. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h and lyophilized. GlcNac production was monitored and quantitated as peracetylated GlcNac by GC [Varian 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector, a Ross injector and a 30 m · 0.25 mm capillary column EC.Tm)1 (100% methylsilicone apolar phase of column, EC.Tm)1, 0.25 lm film phase, Altech), 0.25 lm film phase (Altech, Flemington, NJ, USA)]. The injector and detector temperature was 250 °C, and the oven temperature program was 3 C°Æmin)1 from 120 to 250 °C. The carrier gas helium pressure was 1 bar. Briefly, released GlcNac was peracetylated by addition of 0.5 mL of acetic anhydride to the lyophilized samples, followed by incubation for 4 h at 100 °C. Samples were then evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen and mild heating with a hair dryer. To eliminate salts and proteins from the reaction mixture, 1.5 mL of chloroform and 1 mL of distilled water were added to each tube. After thorough vortexing, the aqueous upper phase was discarded and the lower chloroform phase was extracted four times with 1 mL of distilled water. The chloroform phases were freed of water by filtration through small columns made of a Pasteur pipette filled with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The filtrates were collected in Pyrex tubes (7 mL) and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Chloroform (40 lL) was added to each tube, and 4 lL was injected in the gas chromatograph for analysis. GlcNac production (retention time 33.60 min) was also monitored by GC / MS analysis performed on a Carlo Erba GC 8000 gas chromatograph equipped with a 25 m · 0.32 mm CP-Sil 5CB low-bleed MS capillary column, 0.25 lm film phase (Chrompack France, Les Ullis, France). The temperature of the Ross injector was 250 °C and the samples were analyzed using the following temperature program: 120 °C for 3 min, then 3 C°Æmin)1 until 250 °C. The column was coupled to a Finnigan Automass II mass spectrometer. The analyses were performed either in the electron impact mode (ionization energy 70 eV, source temperature 150 °C) or in the chemical ionization mode in the presence of ammonia (ionization energy 150 eV, source temperature 100 °C). Detection was performed for positive ions.

High-pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD)
HPAEC-PAD was performed with a Dionex Series DX30 HPLC system (Dionex Corporation, Voisins Le Bretonneux, France) equipped with a pulsed electrochemical detector, operating in the pulsed amperometric detection mode with a gold working electrode and an Ag / AgCl reference electrode. Electrode potential settings were E1 + 0.05 V, E2 + 0.6 V and E3 ) 0.6 V, with 500, 3 and 7 ms applied durations, respectively, and an integrated time period of

0.10­0.48 s. Detection was set with a range of detection of 300 nC. Detector response was analyzed with a C-R8A chromatopac integrator (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). A standard sample consisted of 0.1 lgÆlL)1 of each GlcNac, N,N¢-diacetylchitobiose or N,N¢,N¢¢-triacetylchitotriose dissolved in water. Samples (12.5 lL) were injected in a Dionex CarboPac PA-100 pellicular anion exchange column running at a flow rate of 0.8 mLÆmin)1. Elution was performed with buffer A (100 mm NaOH) for 1 min followed by a linear gradient of 0­40% buffer B (100 mm NaOH and 1 m sodium acetate) over 40 min.

Crystallization and structure determination
PPL2 was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C as described [28]. The crystals belong to the P212121 space group with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Crystals soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing 75% of mother liquor [0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m trisodium citrate dehydrate, pH 5.6, and 30% (w / v) PEG 4000] and 25% of glycerol were flash-frozen at 100 K in a liquid nitrogen stream. X-ray diffraction data ° were collected at 1.73 A at the synchrotron radiation source ´ of Cpr station Laboratorio Nacional de Luz Si´ ncrotron (Campinas, Brazil). The data were processed and scaled using mosflm and scala [52], respectively. Crystallographic data are summarized in Table 2. The PPL2 crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement using the amore software [52], using data ° in the resolution range 15­3.0 A, and the hevamine coordinates (PDB accession code 2HVM) as the search model. Rotation and translation functions revealed one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The position and orientation of the molecule, as a single rigid body entity, were refined for 20 cycles with refmac [52], using reflections ° in the resolution range 32­1.73 A. Appropriate amino acid changes were carried out to convert the molecular model of hevamine into PPL2. Several steps of rebuilding, interspersed with restrained refinement, using ref° mac, yielded the current model at 1.73 A resolution. Sulfate ion molecules were placed by inspection of the Fo ­ Fc map. For each cycle of refinement, the stereochemistry of the model was monitored with the procheck incorporated into the CCP4 package [52]. Finally, water molecules were placed in the model over several steps of refinement with arp / warp and inspected manually. The atomic coordinates, fitted with xtalview [52], are accesible from the Protein DataBank (http:// www.rcsb.org/pdb/) under code 2GSJ.
