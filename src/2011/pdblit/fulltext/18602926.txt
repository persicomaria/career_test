Received 18 October 1995 tural elements of G l u R S are likely to have access to the bound t R N A [11]. Actually, our site-directed mutagenesis analyses demonstrated that some amino acid residues in the insertions are important for the aminoacylation of t R N A G~u by GIuRS [111. However, in the preliminary docking model of G l u R S and t R N A Cln (including the coordinates of all the atoms), we detected a steric clash between the two molecules when the energy of the complex was calculated. Therefore, it was still necessary to clarify whether the insertions of G l u R S could actually contact t R N A ~au without any energetic discrepancy. In this study, we constructed a much more sophisticated model of the G l u R S . t R N A ~u complex, by automatic molecular superposition and computer modeling coupled with molecular mechanics calculation. This in fact allowed us to examine how well the GluRS-specific insertions contact the identity-determining base pairs of t R N A ~u.

Abstract A docking model of glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GIuRS) and tRNA Gluwas constructed, on the basis of the distinguished similarity between the X-ray crystallographic three-dimensional structures of the N-terminal halves of the Thermus thermophilus GInRS in the free state and the Escherichia coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase in a complex with tRNA C~n. The modeled structure is energetically favorable and is also well consistent with the results of site-directed mutagenesis studies. The model indicates that the GluRS-specific insertions 2 and 3 fit and bind to the acceptor stem and the D arm, respectively, of the cognate tRNA without affecting other contacts. In particular, insertion 3 strongly interacts with the two D-stem base pairs that are essential for the tRNA'GIuRS recognition.

1. Introduction
A m i n o a c y l - t R N A synthetases (aaRS's) strictly recognize and ligate the specific t R N A ( ' s ) and amino acids. The specificity of a t R N A toward an amino acid (the t R N A identity) depends on the recognition of characteristic nucleotides (identity determinants) in the t R N A molecule by aaRS's [1-6]. Based on the sequences and the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the catalytic domains, the aaRS's are divided into two classes, each with ten synthetases [7]. In general, every class I synthetase has catalytic domains containing the classical nucleotide-binding (Rossmann) fold [8]. As for class I, Escherichia coli g l u t a m i n y l - t R N A synthetase (GlnRS) is the only one for which a crystal structure has been determined for the complex with the cognate t R N A [9,10]. Recently, we have solved the 3D structure of another class I synthetase, g l u t a m y l - t R N A synthetase (GluRS) from Thermus thermophilus [11]. While it had been suggested that G l u R S is closely related to GlnRS, at the level of their overall primary structures, we found a striking similarity in the 3D structures of the N-terminal halves (catalytic domains) o f GIuRS and G l n R S [11]. Simply by substituting G l u R S for G l n R S in the complex with t R N A ~ln (the coordinates of the phosphates only were available in this analysis), we suggested that the t R N A ~ " structure fits quite well in the G l u R S structure, and furthermore, we found that the specifically inserted secondary struc*Corresponding author.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Molecular modeling Molecular mechanics calculations were performed using the united atom force field of AMBER 4.0 [12]. A distance-dependent dielectric function (e = 4r) was used to approximate the solvent screening effect in the energy calculations. A 10-A cutoff distance for non-bonded interactions was used. Energy minimizations were carried out by a conjugate gradient method until the gradient of the RMS force reached 0.1 kcal. mol -~. A -2. These calculations were performed on a DEC3000/ 700 computer. The molecular display and the molecular modeling for the structural modifications were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation using the Insight II molecular graphics program [13]. 2.2. Construction of the initial structure of the E. coli tRNA atu moiety For the template of the acceptor arm of Escheriehia coli tRNA ~u, the atomic coordinates of Eseherichia coil GlnRS-bound tRNA T M [10], a gift from Dr. Steitz to M.G., were used. The coordinates of the anticodon arm of yeast tRNA Ph° [14], and those of the D- and T-arms, and the variable loop of yeast tRNA A~p [15] were obtained form the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank [16]. The nucleotide sequence of each part was changed to that of E. eoli tRNA ~u as follows. First, the coordinates of the phosphate moieties, the ribose moieties, the C4, C8, and N9 atoms of the purine residues, and the N1, C2, and C6 atoms of the pyrimidine residues were taken from the templates. The coordinates of the other atoms were generated using the internal coordinates of AMBER 4.0 by the EDIT module of the program package. Next, for each part, energy minimization was performed with the MINMD module in four steps, first for the base moieties, secondly for the ribose moieties, thirdly for the backbone moieties (the phosphate moieties and the ribose C5' and 03' atoms) by the IBELLY option of the MINMD module, and finally for the entire structure. The D- and T-arms and the variable loop were joined to the acceptor stem, and then to the anticodon arm. G1 was added, since the coordinates of tRNA G~" lack those of residue 1. Next, energy minimization

2.3. Superposition of the N-terminal halves o f GluRS and GlnRS

M. Tateno et al./FEBS Letters 377 (1995) 77~81

The 2.5 A refined crystal structures of GIuRS [11] and GlnRS were used for the superposition (the coordinates of GlnRS were a gift from Dr. Steitz to M.G. [10]). C and FORTRAN programs implementing algorithms by the Rossmann and Argos method [17] for the identification of corresponding atoms were developed (Kaneda et al., in preparation) and combined with the least-squares fitting routine by McLachlan [18]. Using these programs, the coordinates of GluRS were translated and rotated so as to superimpose the Cc~atoms of the GluRS N-terminal half( 1-322; trial structure) with those of the GlnRS N-terminal half (8-342; reference structure). In this way, GluRS was naturally docked with the modeled tRNATM, since the acceptor stem of the tRNA was originally derived from that of tRNA~1" bound to GlnRS.
2.4. Molecular mechanics refinement o f the docking model o f GluRS and tRNA Gi,

In order to find the overlap of atoms between GluRS and tRNAc~" in the initial docking model, for each nucleotide residue, the surrounding amino acid residues were elucidated and the atomic distances between the nucleotide and the amino acid residueswere calculated. When the distances were smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms, energy minimization of the amino acid residues was carried out locally, in order to reduce the high-energy contact. Next, we performed energy minimization for all of the amino acid residues with at least one atom within 4.0 A from the tRNAa~" molecule. This energy minimization was carried out further by using a distance 10.0 A instead of 4.0 A. In these four processes, the atoms of tRNA~" were fixed. Then, the energy of the whole tRNATM molecule was minimized by the four-step procedure described above (see section 2.2). Finally, the energy of the entire GluRS. tRNA~" complex was minimized.
3. Results and discussion

The 3D structures of the N-terminal halves of GluRS and GlnRS are so similar to each other that we could well superimpose them manually [11]. In this study, we have carried out a more precise and quantitative superposition in an automatic manner with the use of a computer program (Table 1). Thereby, GluRS was translated and rotated so as to best-fit the corresponding Ca atoms. Through this analysis, it was found that more than 80% of the Ca atoms in the GluRS N-terminal half could be superimposed with those of the GlnRS N-terminal half. Furthermore, three insertions specific to GluRS were automatically identified; the positions of these insertions in the GluRS sequence correspond well with those of the insertions found by the previous manual superposition, except for a few amino acid residues around the boundaries of insertion 2. Thus, we could definitely determine the inserted sequences specific to GluRS. Similarly, for GlnRS, the specific insertions were unambiguously identified. Every class I synthetase has the conserved motifs 'KMSK' and 'HIGH'. These motifs were found to be superimposed between the GluRS and GlnRS molecules. In addition, about fifty amino acid residues of the GlnRS N-terminal half contact tRNA Gin, and among these amino acid residues, more than forty were found to correspond with those of the GluRS Nterminal half by the superposition. Thus, it was shown that these functional amino acid residues are conserved between the two synthetases. This preservation of the function-structure relationship between the two synthetases naturally led us to consider that the interactions between the acceptor stem of tRNA G~u and the GluRS N-terminal half are also similar to

those of the Gin system. The acceptor stem of the tRNA Cln molecule bound to GlnRS is changed to the active form, i.e. the base pair of G 1- U72 is disrupted and the CCA-extremity forms a hair-pin turn toward the catalytic site of GInRS [9]. Our assumption is that these interactions are essentially conserved in the Glu system. Accordingly, we used the acceptor stem of the tRNA G~nmolecule as the template for that of tRNA Gju. The sequence of the template was exchanged according to that of tRNA G~u, and then the structure was carefully optimized by means of several molecular mechanics steps. However, for the other parts of tRNA G~u,we did not use the coordinates of the GlnRS-bound tRNA G~nas the template in our study, for the following reasons. First, a characteristic feature is found in the variable loop of tRNA aju, i.e. it has four nucleotide residues, in contrast to the five found in most tRNAs, such as E. coli tRNA GInand yeast tRNA Phe. The number of nucleotides in the variable loop is expected to influence the 3D structure of the 'augmented D helix', which is composed of the D stem, the variable loop, and their neighboring nucleotide residues [15,191. In addition, the conformation of the augmented D helix of tRNA G~u could, essentially, be conserved through interactions with GIuRS. Consequently, we used the coordinates of yeast tRNA Asp (the free form) as the template for the D- and T-arms and the variable loop of tRNA G~u,since tRNA Asp has four nucleotide residues in the variable loop [15]. Second, conformational changes of the anticodon loop of tRNA tIn are induced through the interaction with GlnRS [10]. Accordingly, we used the anticodon arm of yeast tRNA Ph°, which is considered to be the standard form of the various tRNAs, as the template for that of tRNA a~u. We exchanged the sequences of the template according to that of tRNA a~u, and then optimized their structures by performing several molecular mechanics steps. The D- and T-arms and the variable loop of tRNA alu were joined to the acceptor stem, and then the anticodon arm was attached to the D arm and the variable loop. The structures around the junctions were relaxed by molecular mechanics calculation. In this way, we constructed a starting structure of tRNA c~u to investigate its interactions with GluRS. Thus, we obtained the starting structure of the docking model of GIuRS and tRNA G~u(note that the modeled acceptor stem is derived from that of the tRNA c~nbound to GlnRS). In order to optimize the interactions between the two molecules in the model, we examined whether there were high-energy contacts between atoms of the GIuRS and tRNA G~umolecules. Although there was no serious steric clash, slight overlaps of atoms between the two molecules were found by the distance calculations. We eliminated the high-energy contacts by performing the molecular mechanics locally around those residues including the overlapped atoms. Finally, we carefully carried out several steps of energy minimization for relaxing the structures of the two molecules, and thus obtained the model of the GluRS-tRNA G~u complex (Fig. 1). The total energy of the complex was significantly decreased (~ 150,000 kcal/mol) through the relaxation of the modeled structure. In particular, the van der Waals energy of the complex was decreased and became remarkably low (--5,000 kcal/mol), indicating that the refinement reduced the overlaps and the highenergy contacts of atoms between the two molecules in the starting structure of the docking model. In order to determine which residues were affected and how largely the structures

were refined, we calculated the r.m.s.d, before and after the refinement for each residue of G l u R S and t R N A G~" (Fig. 2). It was found that the deviations are all within 0.25 A, and their average values are as small as 0.06 A and 0.07 ,~ for G l u R S and t R N A Gl", respectively. In addition, the residues with r.m.s.d

values larger than the average are not localized, but are scattered throughout the two molecules. These results indicate that only slight structural deviations from the starting conformations for the scattered residues were sufficient to avoid all the atomic overlaps, and the consequence was a remarkable de-

Furthermore, the molecular mechanics refinement of the docking model also significantly decreased the electrostatic energy (~ 3,000 kcal/mol), without sacrificing the other energy terms. Thus, the entire structure of the complex was totally relaxed and equilibrated without any appreciable changes in the conformations of the component molecules and their intermolecular geometry. To test the plausibility of the present model structure, we examined the specific intermolecular interactions that may be conserved between the Glu and Gin systems. F o r example, in the X-ray structure of the GlnRS and t R N A GIn complex, the cytidine at position 74 (C74) of the t R N A is looped out and buried in a pocket of GlnRS, and the cytosine base forms a stack with Pro126 [9]. Therefore, it is possible that GluRS recognizes the C74 of t R N A °lu. However, in the starting structure of the GluRS" t R N A Glu complex, the looped out C74 nucleotide residue of t R N A Glu only slightly contacted Prol09, which corresponds to Pro 126 of GlnRS, according to the superposition. In contrast, in the complex structure after the present molecular mechanics refinement, the cytosine base of C74 is closely and extensively stacked onto Prol09, and therefore, is completely buried in a pocket of GluRS. This indicates that the mechanism of the CCA-extremity recognition is well conserved between GlnRS and GluRS. We next investigated the characteristic interactions between t R N A ~j° and the GluRS-specific insertions that were identified by the superposition. We previously suggested that insertions 2 and 3 directly contact the acceptor stern and the D arm, respectively, of the t R N A Glu molecule [11]. Actually, in the present model structure of the GluRS' t R N A G~" complex, one strand of the antiparallel fl-sheet of insertion 2 is entirely bound to the minor groove side of the central five backbone moieties of one strand of the acceptor stem (Fig. 2). Thus, insertion 2 may contribute to the affinity with the t R N A through the van der Waals interaction. On the other hand, insertion 3 fits very

well to the minor groove side of the D arm of t R N A Glu (Fig. 2). As the major identity determinants of t R N A °~u (U11-A24 and U13"G22) are located in the D stem [20], it is most likely that insertion 3 directly binds to the determinants and contributes to the t R N A recognition (mentioned later in detail). At the stage of our previous work, using a model of GluRS and t R N A GIn [11], it was impossible to examine whether the insertions specific to GluRS actually bound t R N A ~Iu, since the t R N A molecule in the model was composed of only the phosphates of the t R N A ~ln molecule as found in the complex with GlnRS. However, as mentioned above, we succeeded in the construction of an energetically favorable model with only slight conformational changes in the GluRS and t R N A c~u molecules. These indicate that the insertions specific to GluRS (insertions 2 and 3) can fit and bind the specific t R N A without influencing the other intermolecular contacts that are conserved between the Gln and Glu systems. We performed a more detailed investigation of the interaction between insertion 3 and the D stem of the t R N A clu molecule in the present model. Residues Ser276 and Glu282 in the insertion, and Ser299 and Lys309, which are spatially close to the insertion, directly contact the strong identity determinants, U l l .A24 and U13"G22, in the D stem of t R N A G~u (Fig. 3). Actually, these amino acid residues were indicated to contribute to the aminoacylation activity of GluRS by site-directed mutagenesis [11]. In this context, the model is also consistent with the experimental results. It should be noted here that the present model is not the final goal of our model building. F o r example, although the anticodon has some other, major determinants of t R N A Glu [20-23], the GluRS C-terminal domain (domain IV) is too distant from the t R N A molecule to bind in the present model. Therefore, for the anticodon recognition by GluRS, we have proposed a byTable 1.

On the basis of the model constructed in this study, we are now investigating, by molecular dynamics simulation, the large conformational changes of t R N A clu and GluRS that are necessary for specific recognition of the anticodon and other determinants.
