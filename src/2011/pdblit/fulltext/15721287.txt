Abstract ­ In order to get deeper insight into the molecular forces responsible for prion pathogenic conversion, conformational properties of a synthetic linear peptide derived from the globular core of sheep prion protein were studied by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. The studied peptide encompassing the [142­166] (in human numbering) region of sheep prion protein, folds in physiological conditions into a -hairpin like tertiary structure, whereas, in the non-pathogenic form of protein and in trifuoroethanol (TFE), the region is engaged in largely -helical conformation. Such structural duality of the fragment indicates a possible transconformational site within prion protein and may explain one of the early structural causes of prion diseases. © 2001 Académie des sciences / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS

1. Introduction
According to the `protein only' hypothesis [1], the fundamental event in prion diseases is the prion protein (PrP) conformational conversion from the

non-pathogenic cellular isoform (PrPC) into a scrapie isoform (PrPSc). This conversion is followed by a major change in secondary structure of prion (-helix to -sheet) and resistance to protease digestion. NMR structures of recombinant PrPC

(mouse, hamster, bovine, human) are very similar [2]: a flexible N-terminal `tail' and a mostly -helical globular core. The structure of PrPSc remains largely unknown. Transgenic studies argue that the normal PrPC is refolded into a pathogenic isoform through a process facilitated by an enigmatic factor X [3]. Striking structural differences between the twoprion isoforms have been revealed by circular dichroism and Fourier-transform infrared [4] and especially by epitope mapping of PrPSc [5]. A single epitope-binding site could not be formed in PrPC, the first segment is spatially separated from the other two-epitope binding sites that are in close proximity. The formation of this PrPSc specific epitope could be explained by structural rearrangement of 142­166 domain of PrP. In the search of a potential `trigger' for prion conformational transition, we studied by CD and NMR spectroscopies the solution structure of a 26-mer peptide. This peptide contains the 25 residues of the domain 145­169 of sheep prion protein (142­166 in human numbering) and C-terminal cysteine. Its sequence GNDYE5DRYYR10ENMYR15 YPNQV20YYRPV25C encompasses the helix-1 and the -sheet 2 (in bold). Our previous experimental results [6] showed that the peptide PrP[142­166] is the first prion-derived peptide distinguished by an intrinsic propensity to -hairpin like conformation (figure 1) at neutral pH. This -propensity can be indicative of some internal driving forces that could facilitate a molecular rearrangement within prion protein during its pathogenic conversion. Our experimental results indicate that the same peptide in trifluoroethanol (TFE) folds into -helical confor-

mation identical to that observed in PrPC structure. The conformational dualism of this peptide, which resembles the ­ transition in the prion protein, provided us with some hypotheses about molecular mechanism of the prion pathological conversion.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Peptide synthesis

The peptide was synthesized on solid phase, deprotected and cleaved using trifluoracetic acid, purified by reverse phase HPLC. The purity exceeded 99 % according to amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry.
2.2. Circular Dichroism (CD)

CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 instrument. Peptide concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorbance. Samples were scanned over the wavelength range 190­260 nm.
2.3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy

Figure 1. NMR solution structure of the PrP peptide in water: superimposition of the 20 lowest energy conformers. The bonds between non­hydrogen atoms only are shown: the backbone bonds are in red, and side chains in blue.

NMR samples were dissolved in H2O/D2O 90:10 (v/v) with 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5 buffered solution or TFE/H2O 87:13 (v/v). TSP and DSS were used as an internal reference for the proton and carbon shifts. The experiments were run at 500 MHz for 1H on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer equipped with a Silicon Graphics workstation. The WATERGATE method [7] was used to eliminate water signal. 1D, TOCSY, NOESY and ROESY experiments were recorded at several temperatures. When all spin systems were identified, the sequential assignment of the peptide amino acid residues was carried out by using the strategy developed by Wüthrich [8]. To resolve the assignment ambiguities resulting from signal overlaps, all experiments were performed at three different temperatures, namely, 5 °C, 20 °C, and 37 °C, exploiting the temperature­ induced shift of the amide resonances. The 3JHN scalar coupling constants were extracted from raw data of 2D-TOCSY spectra (4 K × 1 K). Additional zero filling and linear prediction were applied on raw data. Coupling constants obtained by this method were found to be identical to those measurable in 1D spectra. Heteronuclear 1H­13C experiments (HMQC [9], HSQC phase-sensitive using sensitive enhancement [10] and HMBC [11]) were recorded at 37 °C. The CSI protocol, involved 1H, 13  C , and 13C chemical shifts, allows three independent approaches to be used in identifying and locating secondary structures in proteins [12].

water solution have been deposited with the Bio. Mag. Res. Bank (www.bmrb.wisc.edu; ID code: BMRB-4010).
2.4. Molecular modeling

The NOE distance constraints were classified as strong, medium, weak and very weak, with the upper distances assigned at 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 Å, respectively. The calculations involved multiple cycles of simulated annealing starting from arbitrary extended conformations, with pseudo-atom restraints. At the final approach, appropriate protons were used to replace pseudo-atoms and to solve last ambiguities. For the water structural study, the general purpose ICMD software [13] with AMBER94 force field and the variable target function approach were used. The resultant refined conformation was verified by INSIGHT standard software [14]. NOE constraints, atomic coordinates for 20 conformers and for the best conformer have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org; ID code: 1G04). For TFE structural study, CNS software [15] was used for calculations and verification of conformations by INSIGHT software shows no large difference. Visualization and analysis of the calculated conformers was performed with MOLMOL [16] and PROCHECK­NMR [17].

3. Results
3.1. Secondary structure analysis in TFE

The peptide secondary structure was analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy in different experimental conditions. Early study [6] in aqueous buffered solution showed that the peptide produced a broad negative Cotton effect at 208 nm with a shoulder at 216 nm, and two smaller signals, namely, a positive one at 233 nm and a negative one at 241 nm, which are characteristic of non-random coil conformation [18]. The increase of TFE concentration results in the CD signal transformation to -helix (figure 2). In 20­99.5 % 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE), CD spectra of the peptide showed two negative peaks at 208 and 218 nm and a positive peak at 195 nm, typical of -helix structure. An isodichroic point at 205 nm indicates equilibrium between two distinct conformations. The CSI techniques revealed that residues 3­13 appeared to show -helical propensity (figure 3). Additionally, the -helical structure was reflected in the 3JHN scalar coupling constants (figure 4). The values measured are smaller than their random coil

value [19], which means that these residues preferentially populate -helical  angles. The amide signal shift temperature coefficients ((NH)/T, in ppb·K­1) were derived for all backbone amide protons of the peptide (figure 4). For

NOESY spectra were obtained at a variety of mixing times from 50 to 800 ms. All distance restraints (figure 4) used in the structure refinement (table) were derived from NOEs observed at 5 °C in TFE/H2O. The NOE pattern observed was typical of helical backbone structure.

4. Discussion
Solution structure of the peptide in TFE is very similar to that of prion protein helix `1' [144­154] of the prion protein. This structure is significantly different from that of the corresponding polypeptide segment in water. One of the most remarkable features in the sequence of the PrP[142­166] peptide is the very high content of polar and charged residues. At neutral pH, the two termini should be ionized as well as eight side chains, namely, Asp 3, Glu 5, Glu 6, Arg 7, Arg 10, Glu 11, Arg 15, and Arg 23. The numbers of positively and negatively charged groups are equal; therefore, the sequence itself is perfectly balanced. Moreover, according to the 3D structure obtained, the relative positions of the charged groups in space are such that they tend to neutral

The PrP[142­166] peptide adopts in TFE a conformation with an -helix overall topology and a C-terminal `tail' (figure 5). Part 3­13 of the structure apparently is well defined since most of the NOE signals detected belong to this region. Fragment 13­16 involves a structure very close to the ­turn that was found in aqueous solution and in the corresponding prion protein domain. Interestingly, the C-terminal `tail' has explicit spatial position.

ize one another. In the water structure, six charged groups form salt bridges (namely, Glu 5­Arg 7, Glu 6­Arg 10, and Glu 11­Arg 15) and maintain the -structure. But, in TFE, the same salt bridges can stabilize the -helix structure. These observations strongly suggest that the delicate balance of electrostatic interactions is crucially important for the overall stability of the solution structure of this peptide. Earlier it has been reported that a longer peptide derived from mouse sequence 142­170 aggregates at neutral pH [21]. This peptide has four additional residues (particularly the Asp 167) at its C­terminus. This slight modification can disturb the electrostatic balance so that the overall stability of the fold is reduced and the thermodynamic equilibrium is shifted from intra­ to inter­molecular salt bridges, which may prompt the aggregation.

5. Conclusion
Our experimental results show that the peptide spanning the segment 142­166 (in human numbering) of sheep prion protein, which corresponds to helix `1' and -strand `s2' regions of the normal prion protein, is the first prion­derived peptide dis-

tinguished by an important property: an intrinsic duality to -helix/ -hairpin-like conformations at neutral pH. This propensity can be indicative of some internal driving forces that could facilitate a molecular rearrangement within prion protein during its pathogenic conversion. Particularly, the peptide structure obtained may provide a possible molecular basis (figure 6) underlying the formation of PrPSc epitope that may result from the refolding of helix `1' to form an intramolecular -hairpin.
