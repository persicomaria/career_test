SUMMARY

Human lysozyme, upon excitation at 285 nm, presents a typical tryptophan fluorescence spectrum centered at 334 nm with a fluorescence quantum yield of 0.032. Upon addition of the chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc)3,a,5,6, an enhancement of the fuorescence is observed. This is an indication of the presence in the active site of the enzyme of tryptophyl residues which are affected by the binding of saccharides. The fluorescence of human lysozyme was found to be almost insensitive to pH changes up to pH 7.5, but on addition of saturating amounts of (GlcNAc)3 or (GlcNAc)4 the fluorescence of human lysozyme was enhanced throughout the pH range studied and particularly in the pH range 5 to 7.5. On the basis of the similarity in primary structure between human lysozyme and hen egg-white lysozyme, we explain the pH dependence of the fluorescence of human lysozyme-saccharide complexes by conformational changes affecting the interactions taking place within the two pairs of residues Trp 64-As p IOi and Trp Io8-Glu 35. The association constants of (GlcNAc)2,s,a,5,e to human lysozyme were measured spectrofluorimetrically. The results suggest that the active site of human lysozyme, as that of hen egg-white lysozyme, is made up of a series of subsites with different affinities to the substrate.

INTRODUCTION

Human lysozyme, isolated from the urine of patients suffering from chronic monocytic leukemia 1 is closely similar in its amino-acid sequence 2, tertiary structure 3 and active-site geometry* to hen egg-white lysozyme. Human leukemic lysozyme contains five tryptophan residues at positions 28, 34, 64, lO8, i i i as compared to tryptophan 28, 62, 63, lO8, i i i , 123 in hen egg-white lysozyme, and six tyrosine residues as compared to three in hen egg-white lysozyme. Tryptophan 62, 63 and lO8 in hen egg-white lysozyme form part of the active site of the enzyme. Detailed spectrofluorimetric studies of hen egg-white lysozyme carried out in our laboratory (ref. 5

and V. I. Teichberg and N. Sharon, unpublished) have shown that the active-site tryptophans are the major contributors to the fluorescence properties of hen egg-white lysozyme, and that they can be used as sensitive probes to gain insight into the conformational changes which the enzyme undergoes during binding of inhibitors and substrates and possibly also in the catalytic process. To obtain information on the contributions of tryptophans to the spectral properties of human leukemic lysozyme, we investigated the fluorescence properties of this enzyme and compared them to those of hen egg-white lysozyme. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we also determined the association constants of various saccharides to human leukemic lysozyme. We discuss the results with respect to other properties of human leukemic lysozyme and the recent X-ray analysis of the structure of this enzyme 3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

H u m a n lysozyme isolated from the urine of patients with monocytic or monomyelocytic leukemia and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose was kindly provided by Dr Robert E. Canfield. Before use, the enzyme was passed through a Sephadex G-25 column with o.i ammonium acetate as eluant. It was then extensively dialyzed and lyophilized. Oligosaccharides of N-acetyl-Dglucosamine, (GlcNAc)n, where n = 2-6, were prepared by the method of Rupley n from a partial acid hydrolysate of chitin and were further purified b y paper chromatography on W h a t m a n No. 3 paper using as solvent n-butanol-acetic acid-water (25:6 : 25, upper phase). All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available commercially. Fluorescence measurements were routinely performed with an Aminco-Bowman Spectrofluorimeter equipped with a Rikadenki x-y recorder. A Hanovia 9olC-i-I5 o W xenon lamp was used for excitation at 285 nm. The emission 'monochromator was calibrated with a mercury lamp. The fluorescence emission was measured using a IP-28 photomultiplier tube. All fluorescence measurements were performed in I-cm quartz cuvettes (manufactured b y Hellma), kept at 23 °C in a thermostated cell jacket. Solutions were routinely passed through Millipore filters (H.A.W.P. 0.45/~m) using a Swinnex-I3 millipore adaptor. Dilutions were made to obtain a final absorbance at 285 nm of less than o.I in a I - c m path length cell. The absorbance was measured in a Beckman DB spectrophotometer. Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient for human leukemic lysozyme ~¢ ~'~% nm = 24.7 ~-,~so in water 7. Association constants were determined by fluorimetric titrations as described by Chipman et al. s. The excitation wavelength was 285 nm. The fluorescence emission intensity of the protein was measured at 335 nm. The concentrations of saccharides in the solutions were estimated b y the reducing sugar test of Park and Johnson 9. When the fluorescence of human lysozyme was measured in the presence of saccharides, an aliquot was prepared without the enzyme in order to obtain values of the small contributing absorbance and fluorescence of the saccharide. The values of absorbance were used to correct the fluorescence for the small resultant decrease of exciting light intensity (correction factor = antilog 1/2 A2s5 nm). At the highest saccharide concentration used, such correction was less than lO% of the total change

in the fluorescence of human leukemic lysozyme. The quantum yields (Q) were determined by comparing the area under the corrected fluorescence spectra of the solutions measured, with a reference solution ofp-terphenyl in cyclohexane [Q(p-terphenyl) = 0.921 (ref. IO). Fluorimetric titrations were performed by measuring the fluorescence of the protein in a series of buffers of different p H values (ref. I I ) : from p H 2.2 to 3.6:0.05 M glycine-HC1; from p H 4 to 5.6: o.I M sodium acetate; from pH 6 to 8: o.I M sodium phosphate; from p H 8.6 to lO.6:0.05 M glycine-NaOH.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Upon excitation at 285 nm, human leukemic lysozyme presents a fluorescence spectrum (Fig. I) with a m a x i m u m at 334 4- I nm (~max of emission of hen egg white lysozyme is 342 nm and of t r y p t o p h a n in water is 350 nm) which indicates the presence in the enzyme of t r y p t o p h a n residues in an environment of low polarity. Addition to human leukemic lysozyme of (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)8, (GlcNAc)4, (GlcNAc)~, or (GlcNAc)6 at concentrations for which, on the basis of the association constants (see below), human leukemic lysozyme is effectively saturated, causes only a minor shift (3 nm) to the blue of the m a x i m u m emission wavelength and a small increase in fluorescence intensity. This behaviour is characteristic of tryptophan residues whose environment has become less polar than the original one. The fluorescence quantum yield of human leukemic lysozyme measured by comparison with a reference solution of p-terphenyl in cyclohexane, was found to be 0.032. This value is lower than that of hen egg-white lysozyme, which already has an abnormally low quantum yield (o.o6o), but lies inbetween the quantum-yield values of the derivatives of hen egg-white lysozyme in which either tryptophan 62 or tryptophan lO8 has been oxidized (Q = o.o4I and 0.024, respectively (reL 5; and V. I. Teichberg and N. Sharon, unpublished). This low value m a y indicate either a nonequal contribution of the t r y p t o p h a n residues to the fluorescence of human leukemic

lysozyme or the presence of strong quenching centres in the proximity of the tryptophans. The pH dependence of the fluorescence of human leukemic lysozyme is given in Fig. 2 from which it can be seen that it is rather similar in shape to that of hen eggwhite lysozyme (refs. 5 and 12; and V. I. Teichberg and N. Sharon, unpublished). Whereas the fluorescence of hen egg-white lysozyme is constant from pH 2 to pH 8 and then decreases, the fluorescence of human leukemic lysozyme increases slightly in the acid region between pH 2 and 3-5, stays rather constant up to pH 7 and then decreases in the more basic region. This latter quenching, also observed with hen eggwhite lysozyme, but to a lesser extent, is presumably due to a long range energy transfer to ionized tyrosine residues 1~. The reason for the small extent of fluorescence quenching observed in the very acid pH region is not yet clear. Upon addition to human leukemic lysozyme of (GlcNAc)3, an enhancement of the fluorescence is observed throughout the pH range studied and particularly in the pH range 5 to 7.5 (Fig. 2). In this respect, the behaviour of human leukemic lysozyme is different from that exhibited by hen egg-white lysozyme where addition of (GlcNAc)3 produces a quenching of the fluorescence of the enzyme below pH 5.5. Addition of (GIcNAc)4 to human leukemic lysozyme gives essentially a similar curve as that obtained with (GlcNAc)3. Such a behaviour of the fluorescence pH profile was also observed by Saint Blancard et al. 13 upon the addition of (GlcNAc)3 to a lysozyme extracted from human leukocytes, an enzyme most likely identical to human leukemic lysozyme 1. The similarity of the fluorescence properties of human leukemic lysozyme(GlcNAc)s and human leukemic lysozyme-(GlcNAc)4 suggests an identical conformation of the active site in both complexes, as was found for the corresponding complexes of hen egg-white lysozyme. Since the binding of saccharides to the active site of human leukemic lysozyme results in changes in the fluorescence properties of the enzyme, we may infer the presence of tryptophan residues in the saccharide binding region of human leukemic lysozyme. Moreover, on the basis of the similarity in primary and tertiary structures of hen egg-white lysozyme and of human leukemic lysoBiochim. Biophys. Acta, 278 (1972) 250-257

zyme 3, we may suggest that the residues affected by the binding of saccharides are tryptophan 64 and tryptophan lO8, respectively. From studies of hen egg-white lysozyme and of hen egg-white lysozymesaccharide complexes, as well as of lysozyme derivatives in which tryptophan lO8 or tryptophan 62 were selectively oxidized, we have concluded (ref. 5 and V. I. Teichberg and N. Sharon, unpublished) that the pH dependence of the fluorescence of hen eggwhite lysozyme could be explained by interactions taking place within two pairs of residues, one of which is tryptophan 62 (and/or tryptophan 63) and aspartic acid IOI, and the other is Trp Io8-Glu 35. Since human leukemic lysozyme also possesses corresponding pairs of residues, Trp 64-As p IOI (the position of tryptophan 64 in the peptide chain of human leukemic lysozyme corresponds to that of tryptophan 63 in hen egg-white lysozyme) and Trp Io8-Glu 35, we can interpret the pH dependence of the fluorescence of human leukemic lysozyme and of its saccharide complexes, in terms of changes involving these residues. Human leukemic lysozyme in its native form does not show any significant dependence of its fluorescence on changes of the pH up to pH 7, and we suggest that the geometry of the active site of human leukemic lysozyme is such that the fluorescing tryptophans, Trp lO8 and 64, are far apart from the carboxyl residues glutamic acid 35 and aspartic acid ioi, respectively. They are thus not quenched by these residues and are free to emit. The binding of saccharides to human leukemic lysozyme perturbs the polarity of the enzyme cleft and as a result the fluorescence of human leukemic lysozyme is enhanced and its emission maximum shifted to the blue. This change in polarity is accompanied by a change in the enzyme conformation by which tryptophan lO8 comes closer to glutamic acid 35 and tryptophan 64 closer to aspartic acid IOI. These movements find their spectral expression in the fluorescence-pH dependence of the human leukemic lysozyme-(GlcNAc)~ complex. As seen in Fig. 2, the fluorescence of the complex increases concomitantly with the ionization of two residues, one with a pK around 3.5 and another with a pK around 6. 5. Ionization of carboxyls decreases their ability to quench neighbouring tryptophans 14 i.e. results in dequenching. It is thus possible, by analogy with the situation prevailing in hen egg-white lysozyme (refs 5 and 12; V. I. Teichberg and N. Sharon, unpublished), to infer that aspartic acid i o i and glutamic acid 35 are respectively the residues responsible for the enhancement of the fluorescence in the pH range 2 to 5 and 5 to 7.7. The single histidine in human leukemic lysozyme has a p K of 7.1 but is not at the binding site for oligosaccharide inhibitors 1~ and it is thereTABLEI ASSOCIATION CONSTANTS AND ;FREE ENERGY OF ASSOCIATION OF SACCHARIDES WITH HUMAN LYSOZYME All m e a s u r e m e n t s w e r e p e r f o r m e d a t r o o m t e m p e r a t u r e (23 °C) in o . i M a m m o n i u m a c e t a t e , p H 7.0.

fore unlikely to be involved in the enhancement of the fluorescence in the p H range 5 to 7.7. To provide further evidence on the similarity between the active sites of hen eggwhite lysozyme and human leukemic lysozyme, we measured, b y fluorescence spectroscopy, the association constants to human leukemic lysozyme of several saccharides (Table I). All saccharides were found to bind to the enzyme in a I :i ratio (see Fig. 3). As seen, the chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc)8, (GlcNAc)4, (GlcNAc)5 and (GlcNAc)6 bind to human leukemic lysozyme with essentially identical association constants, as they also do to hen egg-white lysozyme 16 albeit in the latter case with higher association constants. With each of these two enzymes, the dimer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine has an association constant lower by a factor of about IOO than that of the corresponding trimer. A similar ratio was obtained b y Charlemagne and Joll~s 17 who measured the inhibition constants of these two saccharides in the lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus by human leukemic lysozyme. The binding data m a y be explained by using hen egg white lysozyme as analogyl6. We assume that the active site of h u m a n leukemic lysozyme is composed of six subsites A - F and that saccharides bind predominantly in a non-productive manner, (GlcNAc)2 in B-C and (GlcNAc)3,~,5,6 in A-B-C, with the reducing end always at subsite C. The existence of subsites in h u m a n leukemic lysozyme is further substantiated by experiments carried out in our laboratory on the irreversible reaction of human leukemic lysozyme with the epoxypropyl fl-glycoside of di-(N-acetyl-Dglucosamine) 4 and on the transglycosylase activity of human leukemic lysozyme (I. Maoz and N. Sharon, unpublished). From the relationship AF°a = - - R T in Ka, we can calculate the values of the free energies of association for each of the saceharides bound to lysozyme (Table I). Subtraction of AF°a = --3-3 kcal/mole for (GlcNAc)2, occupying subsites B-C, from

AF°a = --5.9 to --5.6 kcal/mole for (GlcNAc)3_ e occupying subsites A - B C gives a value ofzJF°a = --2.3 to --2.6 kcal/mole which m a y be ascribedS, 16 to the free energy contribution of the GlcNAc moiety in subsite A. Since 3 F ° a for (GlcNAc)4_6 is equal within the error range to that of (GlcNAc)3, we assume that these saccharides are bound with three residues (at the reducing end) at subsites A-B-C. The other sugar residues [the non-reducing mono, di and trisaccharide moieties of (GlcNAc)4, (GlcNAc)5 and (GIcNAc)6, respectivelyl are "dangling" out of the cleft and do not contribute to the binding energy. The contribution of the binding energy of a GlcNAc residue at subsite A of human leukemic lysozyme exceeds by about 1 kcal/mole the contribution found for the binding of a GlcNAc residue in subsite A of hen egg-white lysozymeS, 16. The origin of this difference m a y be due to the substitution of certain amino acids that form subsite A, as a result of which the interaction of GlcNAc in that site is strengthened. The values of the association constants of the N-acetylglucosamine oligomers to human leukemic lysozyme are about ten times lower than to hen egg-white lysozyme. Since t r y p t o p h a n 62 plays an important role in the binding of saccharides to hen egg white lysozymes and participates in the formation of a hydrogen bond and non-polar contacts with the saccharide moieties occupying subsites B and C~S,19, its substitution in human leukemic lysozyme by tyrosine 63 m a y lead to a smaller number of contacts with the saccharide and m a y thus result in a lower association constant. This explanation gains further credence in view of the fact that the oxidation of t r y p t o p h a n 62 by N-bromosuccinimide results in a loss of about 2 kcal/mole in the free energy of binding of (GlcNAc)3 to hen egg-white lysozyme (ref. 5 and V. I. Teichberg and N. Sharon, unpublished). Our results of the comparative study of the properties of human leukemic lysozyme and hen egg-white lysozyme indicate clearly that human leukemic lysozyme and hen egg-white lysozyme have, in their active site, regions with similar structural features. This similarity between human leukemic lysozyme, which has been investigated only to a limited extent, and the extensively characterized hen egg-white lysozyme, together with the fact that the human enzyme is between two and twelve times as active as hen egg-white lysozyme, are of particular interest. It indicates that further comparative studies of these and related lysozymes will contribute to the detailed elucidation of their mode of action, and to the understanding of the intimate relationship existing between enzyme structure and function.
