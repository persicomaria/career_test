The HIV-1 regulatory protein Vpr (96 amino acid residues) is incorporated into the virus particle through a mechanism involving its interaction with the C-terminal portion of Gag. Vpr potentiates virus replication by interrupting cell division in the G2 phase and participates in the nuclear transport of proviral DNA. The domain encompassing the 40 C-terminal residues of Vpr was shown to be involved in cell cycle arrest and binding of nucleocapsid protein NCp7, and suggested to promote nuclear provirus transfer. Accordingly, we show here that the synthetic 52-96 but not 1-51 sequences of Vpr interact with HIV-1 RNA. Based on these results, the structure of (52-96)Vpr was analysed by two-dimensional 1HNMR in aqueous TFE (30 %) solution and re®ned by restrained molecular dynamics. The structure is characterized by a long (53-78) amphipathic a-helix, followed by a less de®ned (79-96) C-terminal domain. The Leu60 and Leu67 side-chains are located on the hydrophobic side of the helix, suggesting their involvement in Vpr dimerization through a leucine zipper-type mechanism. Accordingly, their replacement by Ala eliminates Vpr dimerization in the two hybrid systems, while mutations of Ile74 and Ile81 have no effect. This was con®rmed by gel ®ltration measurements and circular dichroism, which also showed that the a-helix still exists in (52-96)Vpr and its Ala60, Ala67 mutant in the presence and absence of TFE. Based on these results, a model of the coiled-coil Vpr dimer has been described, and its biological relevance as well as that of the structural characteristics of the 52-96 domain for the different functions of Vpr, including HIV-1 RNA binding, are discussed.

The genome of the human immunode®ciency virus type-1 (HIV-1) codes not only for structural proteins and enzymes necessary for the viral life cycle, but also for numerous regulatory proteins such as Vpr, the role of which is to ensure a rapid and ef®cient replication of the retrovirus in infected cells (Emerman, 1996).

HIV-1 replication in non-dividing host cells, particularly in macrophages (Connor et al., 1995). Vpr, which contains 96 amino acid residues (Figure 1(a)) is not part of the polyprotein Pr55Gag, and its incorporation into the viral particles requires an encapsidation process in which the C-terminal region of Gag corresponding with p6 (Paxton et al., 1993; Kondo et al., 1995) and NCp7 (Li et al., 1996; de Rocquigny et al., 1997) are involved. A very important function of Vpr is to arrest infected cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Jovett et al., 1995), very likely by a blockade of the p34-cyclin B complex formation shown to be essential for the G2-M phase transition (see He et al.,

1995; Emerman, 1996, for a review). This could occur through activation by Vpr and, more speci®cally, by the complex Vpr-NCp7, of the phosphatase PP2A (Tung et al., 1997), which behaves as a negative regulator of the G2-M transition (Zhao et al., 1996). On the other hand, Vpr seems to play a role in the nuclear transport of the proviral DNA (Heinzinger et al., 1994). Thus, Vpr was found in the nucleus of infected cells and this localization was ®rst attributed, by truncation experiments, to the presence of the arginine-rich 19 amino acid carboxy terminus (Lu et al., 1993), but mutation experiments have revealed that the LR domain (leucineisoleucine-rich domain, residues 60-81) and the putative N-terminal helix 17-34 could also be involved (Mahalingam et al., 1997). As no classical signal of nuclear localization exists in Vpr, it has been proposed that its nuclear transport could occur through speci®c interaction with other nuclear proteins (Zhao et al., 1994a, Refaeli et al., 1995).

However, recent results (Zhang et al., 1998) indicate that Vpr interacts directly with nucleic acids, including HIV-1 RNA (H.d.R. et al., unpublished results). The binding of Vpr to another protein, RIP, has also been reported (Zhao et al., 1994a) and the LR domain was found to be involved in this interaction. In the nucleus, Vpr was reported to bind speci®cally UNG (Bouhamdan et al., 1996), a protein participating in DNA repair. All these studies support the multiple functions of Vpr and its role in virus infectivity. However, the mechanism of interactions between Vpr and retroviral or cellular proteins, or between Vpr and nucleic acids, remains unknown, requiring a preliminary structural study of the protein. Due to its cellular toxicity, Vpr cannot be easily obtained in large quantities under 15N and 13C-labelled forms, facilitating structure determination by heteronuclear NMR. Therefore, the C-terminal fragment (52-96) of Vpr, which has been suggested to be critically involved in many functions of Vpr, as discussed above, was synthesized and its structure determined by two-dimenensional (2D) 1H NMR. The same approach was used to determine the solution structure of NCp7 (Morellet et al., 1992, 1994). The NMR-derived structure of (52-96)Vpr shows the presence of a well-de®ned a-helix encompassing the 53-78 domain. This accounts for the easy dimerization of Vpr through hydrophobic interactions involving Leu60 and Leu67 located in a leucine zipper type motif, a result whose biological relevance was supported by mutations of Vpr and cellular assays using the two-hybrid system. These results are supported by circular dicroism (CD) experiments performed in various solvents, including aqueous medium at physiological pH. The ¯exibility of the C-terminal domain of Vpr likely accounts for the ability of the protein to achieve multiple interactions with different ligands, including nucleic acids as shown here, by using the 1-51 and 52-96 domains of Vpr. Only the latter was able to interact with HIV-1 (1-415)RNA.

Results
NMR study of (52-96)Vpr and identification of secondary structure elements The structure of (52-96)Vpr was analysed by 1H NMR in a 2 mM aqueous solution in the presence of 30 % (v/v) TFE, as large line-broadening effects and partial precipitations were observed in pure water in the 3.4 to 6.5 pH range (Figure 1(b), bottom), very likely due to the well-known aggregation property of the protein (Zhao et al. 1994b). In the presence of TFE, sharper signals were observed, indicating a loss of oligomer formation (Figure 1(b), top and middle). It can be noticed that a propensity for helix formation is a prerequisite for the induction of ordered helix in TFE (Segawa et al., 1991; Dyson et al., 1992).

The 1H chemical shifts of (52-96)Vpr were measured at 313 K, pH 3.4. Clean-TOCSY and E.COSY experiments were used for spin system identi®cation, and NOESY cross signals connecting HN, Ha and Hb of residue i with HN of residue È i  1, for sequential assignment (Wuthrich, 1986). No signi®cant modi®cations of the proton chemical shifts and COSY patterns were observed in the spectra monitored at pH 6.5 (Figure 1(b), top), suggesting a lack of important conformational change in the pH range 3.4-6.5. However, the complete study was achieved at pH 3.4 (Figure 1(b), middle), where the life times of exchanging proton were longer, thus allowing more accurate NOE measurements. In (52-96)Vpr, a continuous series of Ha-high®eld shifts exceeding by 0.3 ppm the chemical shifts for Ha protons belonging to random coil sequences È (Wuthrich, 1986), were measured in the region 55-85 with only three exceptions, if we exclude the three glycine residues, which are less affected by peptide secondary structure. This was suggestive of the presence of helicoidal motifs, since a minimum of four adjacent residues with Ha-up®eld shifts is in favour of an a-helix (Pastore et al., 1990; Wishart et al., 1992).

Low values for the 3JHN,Ha coupling constants were observed for residues 54-72 (except for residues 55-57). A qualitative secondary structure analysis based on the observed strong NOEs NN i,i  1, aN i,i  3, ab i,i  4, bN i,i  3 suggested the presence of an a-helix spanning residues 53 to 78, consistent with the data reported above. The NOE connectivities are summarized in Figures 2 and 3. A complete pattern of strong, sequential dNN(i,i  1) NOE connectivities and daN(i,i  1) NOEs of reduced intensities was observed for residues 55-74, and a nearly complete pattern of daN(i,i  3) connectivities was shown for residues 53-78. The occurrence of a typical a-helix encompassing the 53-78 sequence was reinforced by the observation of a series of NOE cross peaks of daN(i,i  4) type (Figure 3), which are speci®cally found in a-helices and not in 310-helices. The Ha protons of residues 81, 83, 84 and 85 were strongly high®eld shifted and a NOE CaHNH (i,i  3) between Arg80 and Ile83 was observed, suggesting a structure which could be of the nascent helix type in this region (Dyson et al., 1988). The Arg80 NH shows a very low temperature coef®cient, probably related to a shielding of this proton from the solvent. The Ha protons of

the C-terminal residues 86 to 96 have chemical shifts close to random coil shifts, as well as coupling constants in the 5.7-8.0 Hz range, which correspond with averaged 3JHN,Ha values found in the ¯exible peptide sequence. However, the sequential HaNH NOE found between residues 89 and 90 is weaker than expected for a random coil region, and a folding in this region cannot be excluded. The spectra of the mutant Ala60, Ala67 (5296)Vpr were very similar, except for changes occurring at the mutation level, suggesting that the a-helicoidal conformation of the peptide is similar to that of the wild-type peptide (data not shown). NMR derived three-dimensional structure of (52-96)Vpr The structure of (52-96)Vpr was calculated by restrained-simulated annealing, subsequent restrained molecular dynamics and energy minimization. Interproton distance restraints (289), of which 125 were intra-residual, 98 sequential and 66 medium-range, and dihedral restraints (26) from 3 J-couplings were used in the calculations. The 15 structures with the lowest total energies and a larÊ gest average NOE restraint violation of 0.04 A were used for structural analysis (Table 1).

Figure 4 shows the superposition of 15 structures for the (52-96)Vpr peptide with total rms deviations of the backbone atoms (N, Ca, CH , O) of at Ê most 1.0 A. The main motif is a long, well-de®ned a-helix extending from Trp53 to Arg78 (Figure 4), which is slightly less de®ned for the four last (7478) residues (Figure 5). The average rmsd for the superimposed backbone atoms (N, Ca, CH , O) for Ê residues 54-74 is 0.4(Æ0.1) A. The helix is experimentally clearly evidenced by the almost complete series of CaH-NH (i,i  3) NOEs, the CaH-up®eld shifts and sequential NOEs with intense NH-NH and weaker CaH-NH cross-signal intensities. Furthermore the 3JNH,Ha coupling constants were measured to be below 6 Hz for most of the residues in this region (Figure 3). The hydrophobic amino acid side-chains (Val57, Leu60, Ile61, Ile63, Leu64, Leu67, Leu68, Ile70, Ile74) all reside along one face of the helix (Figure 5), thus providing an extended, uninterrupted hydrophobic surface. The residues Leu60, Leu67, Ile74 and Ile81 are in (i,i  7) positions (like the pairs Ile61, Leu68 and Ile63, Ile70) ful®lling the requirements for a leucine zipper formation. However, as the a-helix is less perfectly de®ned in the 74-78 sequence, only the Leu60 and Leu61 residues could possibly be involved in leucine zipper-type intermolecular interaction. Nevertheless, short leucine-zipper motifs with only two leucine residues

per monomer, have been already described to form dimers (Paluh et al., 1988; Wendt et al., 1995). In the helical wheel representation of the helix (Figure 6) hydrophobic residues can be found at positions a (Val53, Leu64) and d (Leu60, Leu67, Ile74). Positions e and g, which often have polar residues (O'Shea et al., 1989b) in leucine zippers contributing to their stability through favourable charge interactions, also bear hydrophobic residues (Ile61, Leu68 and Ile63, Ile70, respectively) in Vpr. This suggests that, in this protein, hydrophobic interactions contribute essentially to the stability of the dimer. Moreover, this distribution of lipophilic residues may give rise to the oligomerization tendency of Vpr, since the e,g residues would not be buried in the dimeric form but remain exposed to the solvent, probably accounting for the aggregation phenomenon. A salt bridge between Glu58 and Arg62 on the hydrophilic side (positions f, b) stabilizes the helix. The up®eld shifts of the protons in the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg73 appear to be induced by a charge-transfer interaction with the aromatic ring system of Phe69, which was found stacked on the charged moiety in several structures. The C-terminal region 79-96 is ¯exible but there are several regions for which backbone rmsd Ê values equal or inferior to 1.0 A can be found. Ê Thus, a turn rmsd (0.8(Æ0.2) A) could account for the high®eld shifted Ha and the CaH-NH (i,i  3)

NOE between Arg80 and Ile83, which are located in the sequence IRIGII. A second region with relaÊ tively low backbone rmsd (1.0(Æ0.4) A) is located at the level of residues 87-90. Homodimerization property of Vpr Circular dichroism spectra of (52-96)Vpr and Ala60 and Ala67 (52-96)Vpr were done at 293 K, pH 6, using a percentage of TFE ranging from 0 % to 30 % (Figure 7). In the absence of TFE, the CD spectra showed characteristics of peptides with a-helical conformation illustrated by two ellipticity minima at 208 and 222 nm (O'Shea et al., 1989a,b). In the presence of 30 % TFE, a solvent which reinforces helicity and disrupts dimeric structures (Muhle-Goll et al., 1994), the CD spectra of both peptides were almost identical. Nevertheless, the slightly enhanced negative ellipticity observed in the presence of TFE could indicate that some turns of helix could be not present under physiological conditions. Although this will not modify the conclusion of this structural study, this must be indicated, since the functional assays with Vpr are performed in the absence of TFE. The difference in the degree of coiling between the two peptides was evaluated by measurement of the ratio of the bands at 222 nm and 208 nm, the latter being enhanced in the case of dimeric coiled-coil interactions by a leucine zipper mechanism (Zhou et al., 1992; Muhle-Goll et al., 1994).

ratio remained constant for spectra of Ala60, Ala67 (52-96)Vpr monitored in the absence or in the presence of 30 % of TFE, while a slight but signi®cant increase in the ratio was observed with (52-96)Vpr in the latter condition (Figure 7). The potency of (52-96)Vpr to form a dimeric structure by coiledcoil interaction was also supported by the presence of a positive band in the 250-320 nm region not observed with the mutant (data not shown). This positive CD band is often found in dimeric structures (Balakrishnan & Easwaran, 1993).

Moreover, the elution times of (52-96)Vpr and Ala60, Ala67 (52-96)Vpr absorbed on a gel ®ltration column well-adapted for separation of short peptides were 19 minutes and 26 minutes, respectively, supporting the tendency of the wild-type peptide to form dimers through a leucine zippertype mechanism (Supplementary Material). We tried to interpret the dimerization property of (52-96)Vpr using a computer generated model, in which the two (52-96)Vpr monomers are arranged in a leucine zipper-like manner (O'Shea et al., 1989a) with Leu60 and Leu67 in position d(dH ) of a coiled-coil (Figure 8). The arrangement consists of a parallel helix dimer with a well-®tting hydrophobic interface connecting the two monomers to a left-handed coiled-coil. This symmetric arrangment is in agreement with the lack of long-range connectivities. Thus, in addition to Leu60 and Leu67, the side-chains of the residues Val57, Leu64 and His71 of both monomers form a common interface, symmetric about the binding axis (Figure 8). The hydrophobic surface of the dimer extends on each side of the two interacting helices with, in particular, the side-chains of Ile63, Ile70 in g,gH positions and Ile61, Leu68, His71 in e,eH positions, respectively. The formation of an homodimeric interaction of (52-96)Vpr through a leucine zipper-like mechanism in vivo was con®rmed by transactivation in the GAL4 two-hybrid system, using Vpr mutants in which leucine or isoleucine residues present in the putative leucine zipper-like motif were substituted by alanine residues. pZip2 encodes the Vpr protein mutated at residues 74 and 81. pZip3 encodes the Vpr protein mutated at residues 60 and 67. pZip6 encodes the Vpr protein mutated at residues 60, 67, 74 and 81. Mutations of the residues 74 and 81 (pZip2) in Vpr had no detectable effect on the dimerization, whereas mutations of residues 60 and 67 (pZip3), located in the more central part of the leucine zip-

per-like motif, completely abolished homodimeric interaction. As expected, when the four leucine/ isoleucine residues located in the heptad repeat of Vpr at positions 60, 67, 74 and 81, were substituted by alanine residues, no colonies are detected. Individual colonies were then grown in liquid culture for quanti®cation of b-galactosidase activity. As shown in Figure 9, the results were similar to those obtained with the plate screen: minimal b-galactosidase activity with pZip3 and pZip6. Failure to observe colonies of b-galactosidase activity in cells transformed with these fusion proteins was not due to a loss of expression or stability of the hybrid proteins, since Western blotting analysis demonstrated that all fusion proteins are readily immunodetected (data not shown). Likewise, the loss of dimerization resulting from the replacement of Leu60 and Leu67 by alanine residues is not due to a loss of the a-helical conformation of the 54-73 sequence, since no signi®cant differences concerning secondary structure were observed in the NMR spectra of the (52-96)Vpr and its Ala60-Ala67 mutant (data not shown).

lel experiment, the entire (1-96)Vpr was shown to interact like (52-96)Vpr with the nucleic acids, including (1-415)RNA. These results reinforce the structural interest for the analysis of the C-terminal domain of Vpr. The present results show that the (52-96)Vpr structure forms a long amphiphilic a-helix of 25 residues, encompassing residues 5378. Only the last ®ve residues of this domain are in a less strictly de®ned a-helical conformation, and are slightly moved out of the helix axis by small changes in the canonical parameters of an a-helix at the level of the interconnection between residues 73 and 74. One helix side comprising Val57, Leu60,

Discussion
Here, we report the structure of the 52-96 C-terminal domain of Vpr, which seems to be involved in the most important functions of the protein. It has been recently reported (Zhang et al., 1998) that a C-terminal-tagged Vpr interacts with DNA sequences, and we have shown that this occurs through the binding of the C-terminal domain (H.d.R. et al., unpublished results). Accordingly gel shift experiments (Supplementary Material) demonstrate that in contrast to (5296)Vpr, the N-terminal part (1-51)Vpr was unable to bind the HIV-1 (1-415)RNA leader containing all the untranslated cis-regulatory elements.

2112 Ile61, Ile63, Leu64, Leu67, Leu68, Ile70 and Ile74 is completely hydrophobic while the other side is occupied mainly by polar residues (Figure 5). The helical region is followed by a tail, encompassing residues 79-96, which is more ¯exible. In the NMR structure, Cys76 is placed in a manner which does not allow a putative (52-96)Vpr dimer to be formed by a disulphide bridge. This is in keeping with results showing the independence of Vpr dimerization on reducing conditions (Paxton et al., 1993). Based on the (i,i  7) spacing of Leu60, Leu67, Ile74 and Ile81, the LR domain has been proposed to contain a leucine zipper-like domain (Zhao et al., 1994b), which was indirectly shown by a method in which dimerization of Vpr was required to activate a biochemical process (Wang et al., 1996). Interestingly, the LR domain was found to be involved in the nuclear localization of Vpr (Mahalingam et al., 1997). Our experiments show clearly the importance of the well-aligned residues Leu60 and Leu67 for the leucine zipper-like formation, and their appropriate spatial disposition for participating in Vpr dimerization. The NMR structure also shows that this is not the case for Ile74 and Ile81, which were found to be outside the a-helical region 54-73, and thus cannot be directly involved in a leucine zipper-like structure. The use of the two-hybrid system con®rms that dimerization of Vpr involves leucine 60 and 67, and not the isoleucine residues. In good agreement with these results, a coiled-coil dimerization process was evidenced by circular dichroism and by comparing the retention times of (52-96)Vpr and its Ala60 and Ala67 mutant on a gel ®ltration column. Although both peptides were shown by NMR to adopt a similar a-helical conformation, only the wild-type peptide exhibited a tendency to selfassociate. Unlike the classical bZIP-motifs (basic zipper) in which the basic residues are N-terminal with respect to the zipper region, and in which oppositely charged residues are in g and e positions in the coiled-coil, providing additional electrostatic stabilization (Vinson et al. 1989; O'Shea et al., 1991; Wendt et al., 1995), in (52-96)Vpr the residues in g and e positions are hydrophobic and the basic residues are located in the C terminus. The stability of the coiled-coil interaction observed in (52-96)Vpr is, therefore, probably lower than that found (Kd $ 10À6M) in transcription factors such as GCN4 (O'Shea et al., 1991; Wendt et al., 1995) and closer to that occurring in the helix-loop-helix protein family, which also possesses a leucine-zipper motif (Muhle-Goll et al., 199,4 and references cited herein). In the latter proteins, the recognition of speci®c DNA sequences is facilitated by a dimerization of the leucine-rich motif, but this process is not strictly required for DNA binding. The tendency of (52-96)Vpr to form oligomers, which also occurs in the entire protein (Zhao et al., 1994b; Mahalingam et al., 1997), can thus be explained by coiled-coil hydrophobic interactions.

NMR Structure of the C-terminal Domain of Vpr

The NMR structure of (52-96)Vpr and its dimerization also account for the resistance of wild-type Vpr to trypsin digestion of the basic amino acid residues located in the 1-73 region, while those belonging to residues 74-96 remain easily accessible (Zhao et al., 1994b). Vpr homodimers could correspond with the stabilized form of the protein, since early observations have shown that antibodies in HIV-1-infected patients preferentially recognize the dimer (Grass-Masse et al., 1990). Several results support the biological relevance of coiled-coil interactions in Vpr. Thus, Vpr has been reported to form cation selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers in vitro (Piller et al., 1996), and the 53-72 hydrophobic segment has been proposed to span the phospholipid bilayer as a transmembrane helix. The NMR structure of (52-96)Vpr shows that Arg73, Gln65, Gln66, Arg62 and Glu58 located on one side of the (53-73) a-helix could easily interact by salt bridge formation with residues Glu21, Glu25, Glu29 and Arg32 found on one side of a modeled amphiphilic a-helix encompassing the 17-34 sequence of Vpr (data not shown). Furthermore, both a-helical domains were also shown to be essential for the nuclear localization of Vpr and the in vivo stability of Vpr (Yao et al., 1995; Mahalingam et al., 1995, 1997). In contrast, the leucine zipper region seems not to be essential for incorporation of Vpr, since point mutations within the C-terminal helix domain did not impair virus incorporation, in contrast with point mutations in the putative N-terminal helix (Yao et al., 1995; Mahalingam et al., 1997). This suggests that Vpr could be incorporated into budding particles under a monomeric form, probably within a ribonucleoprotein complex containing the NCp15 domain of Gag (NCp7  p6) and another viral protein, which could be Vif (Kondo et al., 1995; de Rocquigny et al., 1997; Bouyac et al., 1997; Roques et al., 1997). Moreover, recent in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that interaction between the sequence (80-96)Vpr and the zinc ®nger domain of NCp7 was crucial for Vpr encapsidation (de Rocquigny et al., 1997), in agreement with previous mutagenesis studies (Paxton et al., 1993). Further studies are required to analyse the possible role of this short sequence in NCp7/Vpr interaction. Interestingly, the sequence 71HFRIGCRHSRI82G, in particular Arg73, was identi®ed as being responsible for the actions of Vpr in causing cell growth arrest in the G2 phase and gross cell enlargement of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Macreadie et al., 1995). This seems to occur by activation of the protein phosphatase PP-2A0, which functions as an inhibitor of G0 to M transition in the cell cycle, possibly through the formation of a complex between Vpr and the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 (Tung et al., 1997). The determination of (52-96)Vpr structure was, therefore, an essential preliminary step towards the elucidation of structures of complexes formed with NCp7, or nucleic acids, and Vpr by

solution. The addition of SDS up to 0.32 M at pH 6, to try to reduce peptide-peptide interactions, improved the NMR spectrum of (52-96)Vpr, but only the addition of 30 % TFE was suf®cient to completely avoid aggregation (transition between 10 % and 20 % of TFE), allowing sharp signals to be obtained. The same procedures were used to study Ala60, Ala67 (52-96)Vpr. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX600 spectrometer operating at 600.14 MHz without sample spinning with 2 K real t2 points (4 K for the E.COSY) with a spectral width of 7246 Hz, 512 t1-increments (1 K for the E.COSY). The transmitter frequency was set to the water signal, which was suppressed by irradiation during the relaxation delay of 1.6 seconds between scans. The temperature was externally controlled using a SK107 unity (Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The data were processed with UXNMR (Bruker) and FELIX/ NMRchitect (Biosym). Phase-shifted sine-squared (shifts of p/2 to p/2.5) or sine bell (shifted by p/6) window functions were applied prior to Fourier transformation in both dimensions. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 3-trimethylsilyl-propionic-d4 acid sodium salt, TMSP (S.D.S, France) used as internal standard. Structure calculation NOE cross-signal volumes (NOESY, 100 ms mixing time, 313 K) were converted into distances either by a rÀ6 dependency (with 10-20 % tolerance to account for integration errors) for well resolved peaks or semiquantitatively by counting contour levels. In this case, NOE signals were classi®ed into eight categories of upper disÊ tance limits between 2.5 and 6 A. In the case of NH proÊ Ê tons, 0.2 A was added to upper limits 43.5 A (Williamson et al., 1985). The distances were calibrated using the Gln-gH geminal protons. Pseudoatom corrections were added when necessary. Dihedral torsion angle restraints (26) based on the 3JHN,Ha measurements, were included in the ®nal calculations with a tolerance of 20 deg. Application of dihedral restraints was restricted to the structured 54-85 part of the molecule. Seventy initial structures were generated by simulated annealing. The structures were then re®ned by restrained molecular dynamics (5 ps/1000 K, 10 ps/600 K, 55 ps/ 300 K with a timestep of 1 fs), followed by energy minimization (1000 steps steepest descents followed by conjugate gradients until a maximum gradient value of Ê 0.002 kcal/mol per A was obtained). The 15 best energy minimized structures with the lowest total energies, the lowest NOE restraint violations and the lowest rmsd with respect to the backbone of the main helix were used for ®nal structural analysis. The calculations were performed by means of the NMRchitect software (Biosym/ MSI). Gel filtration A comparison of the potency to dimerize of (5296)Vpr and its Ala60, Ala67 (52-96)Vpr mutant was investigated by using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia, France), which is well-adapted for separation of peptides and proteins in the Mr range 300070,000 Da (52-96)Vpr (200 ml) or its mutant (1 mmol) in 5 mM NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 6), were injected on the pre-equilibrated column connected to a FPLC apparatus (Pharmacia, France) at a ¯ow rate of 1 ml/ minute (1.2 MPa). Elution times of (52-96)Vpr and Ala60, Ala67 (52-96)Vpr were 19 minutes and 26 minutes,

NMR, as recently shown in the case of NCp7 (de Guzman et al., 1998; Morellet et al., 1998). In the case of Vpr, the sequence 70-80, which contains three arginine residues (Arg70, Arg73 and Arg80) appears essential for the interaction with nucleic acids (H.d.R. et al., unpublished results). In vitro experiments showed that nucleic acid binding was not dependent on (52-96)Vpr dimerization, since the af®nity of the Ala60, Ala67 mutant for HIV-1 (1-415)RNA is only slightly lower than that of the wild-type peptide. However, one cannot avoid a possible role for the leucine zipper motif in vivo in the formation of a speci®c complex with the proviral DNA within the pre-integration complex, in which the concentration of Vpr is probably higher than 10À5 M (Emerman, 1996; Bouyac et al., 1997). A ®nal answer about the possible role of the N-terminal domain in the biological functions of Vpr, mainly ensured by the C-terminal 52-96 sequence, requires the structure determination of the entire (1-96)Vpr, which is planned after incorporation by solid phase synthesis of 15N/13Cenriched amino acids in different positions.

Materials and Methods
Solid-phase peptide synthesis (52-96)Vpr was synthesized by automated solid-phase synthesis using the FMOC strategy and puri®ed by reversed-phase HPLC, using procedures already reported for the synthesis of other retroviral proteins (de Rocquigny et al., 1992). The peptide was analysed by mass spectrometry and found to have a purity higher than 98 %. Ala60-Ala67(52-96)Vpr, (1-51)Vpr and (1-96)Vpr were also obtained by this method (de Rocquigny et al., 1997). It is important to note that it is dif®cult to obtain Vpr in large quantities by classical methods of transfection, because this protein is highly toxic for cells classically used for protein expression, arresting division in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Jovett et al., 1995). Sample preparation and NMR spectroscopy (52-96)Vpr was dissolved in water containing 30 % TFE-d2 (S.D.S., Peypin, France) to a ®nal sample concentration of 2 mM. To prevent oxidation of the very sensitive Cys76, the sample was prepared under argon and deuterated DTT was added at a concentration of 10 mM. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive 1H Clean-TOCSY (70 ms spin lock; Griesinger et al., 1988), E.COSY (Griesinger et al., 1985) and NOESY (mixing times 100 ms and 200 ms; Jeener et al., 1982) spectra utilizing time-proportional phase incrementation (TPPI; Marion & È Wuthrich, 1983) were recorded at 293 K and 313 K for pH 3.4 and 6.0 (uncorrected meter readings). The vicinal 3 JHN,Ha coupling constants were measured from the E.COSY cross-signals and corrected according to the method by Kim et al. (1989). Vpr has a strong tendency to aggregate in aqueous solutions (Zhao et al., 1994b) at the millimolar concentrations used in NMR spectroscopy. Uninterpretable spectra with large broadening of the proton signals show that the 52-96 fragment also self-associates in aqueous

respectively, supporting the propensity of the wild-type peptide to form dimers through a leucine zipper-like mechanism (Supplementary Material). Circular dichroism measurements CD were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon, CD6 spectrodichrograph (Longjumeau, France), using a 1 mm path length cell. The temperature was recorded at 293(Æ0.1) K and the wavelength increment and accumulation time used were 0.2 nm and 1 second per step, respectively. Each spectrum was obtained at a peptide concentration of 2 Â 10À5 M in 5 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6) and with increasing concentrations of TFE from 0 % to 30 %. All spectra resulted from averaging four successive individual spectra, and baseline corrected spectra were smoothed by using third order least-squares polynomial ®t. The tendency of (52-96)Vpr to form dimeric structure by coiled-coil interaction was also supported by the presence of a positive band in the 270-290 nm region not observed with the Ala60 and Ala67 mutant. This positive CD band is often found in dimeric structures (Balakrishnan & Easwaran, 1993). Plasmid constructions All recombinant DNA methods were performed according to standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). The construction of plasmids pGBT10 and pGADGH has been described (Chardin et al., 1993). The Vpr gene from the HIV-1 LAI isolate (Peden et al., 1991) was ampli®ed by PCR using a 5H Vpr1 primer and a 3H Vpr2 primer containing BamHI and PstI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned in-frame into the corresponding sites of pGBT10 to obtain the plasmid pGB-Vpr. The protein expressed from pGB-Vpr was a chimeric protein containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4BD) at the N terminus and, the Vpr protein at the C terminus. To obtain the plasmid pGA-Vpr expressing the chimeric protein containing the GAL4 activating domain (GAL4AD) at the N terminus and the Vpr protein at the C terminus, the Vpr gene was ampli®ed by PCR using a 5H Vpr3 primer and a 3H Vpr4 primer containing BamHI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned inframe into the same sites of pGADGH. Mutagenesis of

the Vpr gene was done with complementary PCR oligonucleotides that contained the region of the gene with the desired mutations. Two rounds of PCR using the primer sets listed in Table 2 were used to construct pZip2 (containing mutations I60A and L67A) and pZip3 (containing mutations I74A and I81A). To obtain the pZip6 construct containing mutations I60A, L67A, I74A and I81A, PCR ampli®cation with Zip3 primers was performed using the pZip2 construct as a template. The PCR products were then cloned back into the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites of pGADGH. All new constructs were sequenced to verify reading frames and mutations.

Yeast two-hybrid system Yeast reporter strain HF7c (Bartel & Fields, 1995), containing two GAL4-inducible reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ genes, was cotransformed with the Vpr expressing plasmids pGB-Vpr and pGA-Vpr. Double transformants were plated on tryptophan, leucine and histidinede®cient synthetic medium and growth was allowed for three days. Liquid culture assay for b-galactosidase activity was performed as described (Bartel & Fields, 1995) using SFY526 as yeast reporter strain (Bartel et al., 1993) and O-nitrophenyl-b-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Yeast cells (S. cerevisiae) were transformed with each of the expressing plasmids, and double transformants were selected for their ability to grow on selective medium and to produce b-galactosidase activity. The fusions were tested against each other. Coexpression of parental Vpr proteins allows growth in the absence of histidine, indicating that Vpr is able to form homodimers (data not shown). That the appearance of the colonies was indeed due to homomultimer formation was demonstrated by the ®nding that the wild-type Vpr fusion proteins failed to induce growth when expressed in the presence of an empty GAL4 expression vector. These results are in agreement with a study using a similar yeast genetic system which reported that Vpr can homodimerize (Bogerd et al., 1993).
