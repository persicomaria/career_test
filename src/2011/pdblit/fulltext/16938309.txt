Abstract The multifunctional low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinra 2-macroglobulin receptor ZLRP. binds and degrades several ligands involved in protease and lipoprotein metabolism. We previously reported that nickel ZNi 2q . specifically inhibits the binding of activated a 2-macroglobulin Z a 2 M ) . at 48C to LRP and had no effect on the binding of other ligands to the receptor ZHussain et al. Z1995. Biochem. 34, 16074≠16081.. In the current investigation, we have examined the effect of Ni 2q on the catabolism of 125 I-labeled a 2 M ) , receptor-associated protein ZRAP. and lactoferrin at physiologic temperatures by fibroblasts. Nickel completely inhibited the degradation of a 2 M ) over a wide range of concentrations Z0.3≠2.4 nM.; 50% inhibition for the degradation of 1.2 nM a 2 M ) was observed at 0.5 mM Ni 2q. Furthermore, nickel inhibited the binding, internalization and degradation of 125 I-a 2 M ) in a dose- and time- dependent manner. In contrast, the degradation of several concentrations of 125 I-RAP by fibroblasts was not affected by different amounts of Ni 2q for various times. Similarly, Ni 2q did not inhibit the degradation of lactoferrin either before or after treating the cells with heparitinase to remove cell-surface proteoglycans. The degradation of lactoferrin was, however, inhibited by the RAP indicating that lactoferrin degradation was mediated by the LRP. These data suggest that Ni 2q is a specific inhibitor for the degradation of a 2 M ) .

involved in the clearance of a 2 M ) is the low density lipoprotein Z LDL. receptor related-proteinra 2macroglobulin receptor ZLRP. Zfor reviews, see w2≠ 9x.. In addition to LRP, evidence has been presented for the presence of a signaling receptor in macrophages that interacts with a 2 M ) and increases intracellular calcium w10≠12x. The LRP is a multifunctional, cell-surface receptor involved in the catabolism of proteases, proteaserprotease inhibitor complexes, lipoproteins and other ligands Zfor reviews, see w4≠8x.. It belongs to a family of endocytic receptors structurally related to the LDL receptor which includes the gp330rmegalin, VLDL receptor, chicken vitellogenin receptor and some others w13≠17x. These receptors are characterized by their ability to catabolize more than one ligands which may be structurally and functionally unrelated. Attempts to identify the a 2 M ) binding site on the LRP have been unsuccessful. For example, different LRP fragments and minigene constructs have been shown to bind RAP and other ligands but not the a 2 M ) w18,19x. These studies suggest that the a 2 M ) binding site is either different from the binding site of receptor associated protein ZRAP. and other ligands or it is sensitive to biochemical and molecular manipulations. The RAP copurifies with LRP and acts as a chaperone during the biosynthesis of the receptor w20,21x. It has been shown to inhibit the binding of all ligands to the members of the LDL receptor family. Since, the LRP is essential for life w22x, inhibitors that differentially inhibit the binding of different ligands may be useful in controlling some physiologic functions without affecting others. We have demonstrated that nickel inhibits a 2 M ) binding to LRP at 48C but had no effect on the binding of RAP and Pseudomonas exotoxin A to the receptor w23x. Nickel has been shown to bind to purified, immobilized LRP at two to three sites with a k d of 0.04 m M w23x. The effect of nickel on a 2 M ) catabolism has not been studied under physiologic conditions. The effects observed at 48C can not be extrapolated to 378C. It is well-known that several enzymes exhibit no or significantly reduced activity at 48C compared to 378C. Similarly, several temperature sensitive mutations result in loss of life at non-permissive temperatures. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that affinities for protein-protein interactions and protein-

metal interactions are different at different temperatures. The effect of temperature on receptor-ligand interaction has been well-documented. The affinity of LDL to LDL receptor is decreased at 378C compared to 48C w24x, whereas, the affinity of estradiol to estrogen receptor is increased by 12-fold at higher temperatures w25x. Increase in temperature has also been shown to result in decrease affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin w26x. However, the effect of temperature on metal-protein interactions has not been characterized in detail. It is, however, known that the binding of CuZII. to lysozyme, but not to ribonuclease, is significantly decreased at 378C compared to 48C w27x. Thus, in the present investigation, we studied the effect of nickel on the cellular catabolism of different ligands of LRP.

2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials Native a 2-macroglobulin, a generous gift from Drs. Maria Kounnas and Dudley Strickland of the American Red Cross, was activated with methylamine w23,28x. A plasmid expressing recombinant GST-RAP was kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz of the University of Texas, Dallas. RAP was purified as described w28≠30x. Lactoferrin Zcatalog a L4894., heparitinase Za H8891., dog serum albumin Za A3184. and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. ZSt. Louis, MO. . Free 125 I was obtained from DuPontrNew England Nuclear ZWilmington, DE, catalog a NEZ-033A. and used for radiolabeling of proteins w23,28,30,31x. Nickel chloride Zcatalog a N6136. was obtained from Sigma and 100 mM stocks were prepared in 50 mM Tris, containing 5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 8.0. Fetal bovine serum and cell culture media were from Biofluids, MD, and Bio-Whittaker, MD, respectively. 2.2.

TX. and cultured Z378C, humidified airr5% CO 2 . in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ZDMEM. containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillinrstreptomycin ZGibco BRL.. Cells were plated at a density of 100 000 cellsrwell in 24 well plates, allowed to grow for 24 h at 378C and used for experiments. Cells were 80≠90% confluent at this time. 2.3. Binding, internalization and degradation of different ligands by cells Cells were washed with DMEM containing penicillinrstreptomycin and incubated in the same medium for 60 min. To quantitate the amounts of ligands degraded, cells were incubated with 125 Ia 2 M ) Z1.2 nM or other indicated concentrations, specific activity 1000≠2000 cpmrng., 125 I-RAP Z26 nM or other indicated concentrations, specific activity 1000≠2000 cpmrng., or 125 I-lactoferrin Z 12 m grml, specific activity 1500≠2000. in DMEM containing 15 mM Hepes, 4% pig serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 5 h at 378C. At the end of the experiments, cell culture medium was collected into a tube containing trichloroacetic acid Z TCA, final concentration of 10%. , incubated on ice for 30 min, centrifuged and an aliquot of the supernatant was counted. TCA soluble counts represented degraded proteins. In all experiments, ligand degradation was corrected for the amount of TCA-soluble 125 I present in control wells with no cells. The free iodine represented less than 10% of the degraded ligand. To determine nonspecific degradation, 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligands was added as indicated in different figure legends. To measure cell surface binding and internalization of radiolabeled ligands, cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with phosphatebuffered saline ZpH 7.4. containing 50 m grml trypsin and 50 m grml proteinase K and 5 mM EDTA for 15 min at 48C w30≠32x. The cell suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 48C, and the supernatant was carefully transferred to another tube and counted; these counts represented surface bound ligands at the end of the experiment. The cell pellet was washed twice, dissolved in 0.1 N NaOH, and counted; these counts represented internalized ligands. Total protein present in the cell pellet was determined w33x using the Coomassie Plus reagent ZPierce. .

2.4. Heparitinase treatment of cells MEF cultures were washed, and incubated for 5 h at 378C with DMEM medium with or without heparitinase Zfinal concentration, 4 Urml; 100 = stock was prepared in sterile saline immediately prior to use. as described by Ji and Mahley w34x. The medium was removed, cells were washed three times and incubated with DMEM containing 4 mgrml pig serum albumin, 5 mM CaCl 2 and different amounts of 125 I-lactoferrin for 5 h at 378C. The amount of lactoferrin degraded was measured as described above.

3. Results 3.1. Effect of nickel on the degradation of a 2 M ) by murine embryonic fibroblasts Fig. 1 shows the effect of Ni 2q on the binding, internalization and degradation of different concentrations of 125 I-a 2 M ) at 378C. The degradation of a 2 M ) was linear up to 1.2 nM. The amount of a 2 M ) degraded at this concentration was Zf 100 ngrmg cell protein. similar to that observed by Willnow and Herz w35x. In the presence of 2 mM nickel, however, MEF cultures were unable to degrade a 2 M ). As shown in Fig. 1A, the specific degradation of a 2 M ) was inhibited by 90≠100%. The internalization of radiolabeled a 2 M ) was also significantly inhibited by nickel ZFig. 1B. . The inhibition of internalization and degradation was probably due to the inhibition of a 2 M ) binding to cells by nickel ZFig. 1C.. MEF cells bound significant amounts of a 2 M ). But, in the presence of nickel, no specific binding could be observed ZFig. 1C.; since the values were close to zero, the line representing the effect of nickel is not visible. These studies suggest that nickel inhibits the binding, internalization and degradation of 125 I-a 2 M ). To study the dose response effect of nickel on a 2 M ) degradation, cells were incubated with radiolabeled a 2 M ) with various concentrations of Ni 2q ZFig. 2. . Nickel inhibited the degradation of 125 Ia 2 M ) at all concentrations ZFig. 2A.. The concentration of Ni 2q required for 50% inhibition was f 0.5 mM ZFig. 2A.. The amount of a 2 M ) internalized

a 2 M ) to the signaling receptor, we performed competition experiments using RAP. RAP inhibited the a 2 M ) degradation in a dose-dependent manner Zdata not shown. , suggesting that a 2 M ) was being degraded primarily by the LRP and Ni 2q inhibited this degradation. Recently, Howard et al. have also shown that a 2 M ) is mainly degraded by LRP and not by

the signaling receptor w12x. The importance of the binding of a 2 M ) to LRP was demonstrated further using fibroblasts that were deficient in LRP. These fibroblasts did not catabolize any significant amounts of a 2 M ) as has been previously reported w35x. Thus, a 2 M ) is primarily degraded by a LRP-dependent endocytic pathway.

3.2. Effect of Ni 2 q on the degradation of RAP To investigate the specificity of the inhibitory action of the Ni 2q, we studied its effect on the degradation of two different ligands; RAP Zcompetes for a 2 M ) binding to LRP. and lactoferrin Zdoes not compete for a 2 M ) binding.. The degradation, internalization, and binding of RAP was linear with increasing concentrations of added radiolabeled RAP ZFig. 4.. Inclusion of nickel in parallel cultures had no effect on these processes Z Fig. 4. . Note that under similar conditions, nickel completely inhibited the degradation of a 2 M ) Zcompare Fig. 4A with Fig. 1A.. Next, we studied the effect of different concentrations of nickel on the catabolism of RAP Z Fig. 5.. At all concentrations used, nickel had no inhibitory effect on the degradation of RAP ZFig. 5A.. Note that 1.6 mM nickel inhibited about 90% of the a 2 M ) degradation but had no effect on RAP degradation Zcompare Fig. 2 with Fig. 5. . To examine if higher concentrations of nickel would inhibit RAP degradation, we used up to 6.4 mM nickel with no effect on RAP degradation Zdata not shown.. These studies suggest that nickel Z0.2 to 6.4 mM. had no significant inhibitory effect on RAP catabolism. Furthermore, we studied the effect of Ni 2q on the time-course of RAP degradation. The total degradation of RAP increased with time and was in general greater in the presence of nickel ZFig. 6A.. This was mainly due to

increased non-specific degradation of RAP in the presence of nickel ZFig. 6B. . Nonetheless, nonspecific degradation was less than 25% of the total degradation. The specific degradation of RAP was similar in cells incubated with or without nickel ZFig. 6C.. Only at 8 h, f 20% inhibition in RAP degradation was observed. Note that under similar conditions, a 2 M ) degradation was completely inhibited Zcompare Fig. 6C with Fig. 3C. . These studies indicate that Ni 2q does not inhibit the catabolism of RAP but specifically inhibits a 2 M ) catabolism. 3.3. Effect of Ni 2 q on the degradation of lactoferrin by LRP To investigate further the specificity of Ni 2q effect, we used another ligand of LRP, lactoferrin. Cells were incubated with 125 I-lactoferrin at 378C for 5 h, with or without Ni 2q ZFig. 7A.. We studied the degradation of 125 I-a 2 M ) in parallel. Nickel did not inhibit the degradation of lactoferrin but inhibited the degradation of a 2 M ) ZFig. 7A.. Lactoferrin is known to bind to proteoglycans in addition to the LRP w34x. Consideration was given to the possibility that nickel did not affect lactoferrin degradation because the majority of the lactoferrin was binding to proteoglycans and nickel does not affect this binding. Thus, to study the effect of nickel on the LRP-mediated degra-

After 5 h, the amount of degraded lactoferrin was measured as described in Section 2.

dation of lactoferrin in the absence of cell-surface proteoglycans, cells were pretreated with heparitinase w34x. Heparitinase treatment of cells decreased lactoferrin degradation by 50% ZFig. 7B. compared to non-treated cells Zcompare with Fig. 7A.. This is in agreement with other studies describing decreased degradation of lactoferrin after heparitinase treatment w34x. Next, degradation of lactoferrin was studied in the presence of nickel in heparitinase-treated cells ZFig. 7B.. Again, nickel had no inhibitory effect on the degradation of lactoferrin. To confirm that lactoferrin was being degraded by LRP-mediated endocytic process, its degradation was studied in the presence of unlabeled RAP. RAP inhibited greater than 70% of the lactoferrin degradation in heparitinase-treated cells indicating that majority of the lactoferrin was degraded by LRP-mediated endocytosis as has been described by others w34,36x. The residual binding may indicate presence of additional binding sites for lactoferrin or an incomplete competition by the RAP. These studies suggested that the catabolism of lactoferrin was not inhibited by nickel.

4. Discussion In the present study, we demonstrated that Ni 2q specifically inhibits the binding, internalization and degradation of a 2 M ) by fibroblasts at 378C. It did not inhibit the catabolism of RAP and lactoferrin indicating that nickel is a very specific inhibitor for a 2 M ) catabolism. Previously w23x, we have shown that nickel inhibits the binding of a 2 M ) to LRP but had no effect on the binding of RAP or Pseudomonas exotoxin A. The inhibitory effect of Ni 2q on the binding of a 2 M ) to cells at 48C was not due to its interaction with a 2 M ) but was due to its interaction with LRP. Thus, it appears that nickel possibly binds to LRP and inhibits a 2 M ) catabolism by cells. The inhibition of a 2 M ) degradation by nickel was surprising because nickel has low affinity for the LRP w23x. Furthermore, it was known that a 2 M ) binds with very high affinity to LRP at 378C and is cleared very rapidly from circulation w1≠3x. The observed inhibition indicates that nickel acts as a potent antagonist probably because two to three molecules of nickel bind to the receptor w23x and this binding causes conformational change in LRP resulting in

significantly decreased affinity towards a 2 M ). More experiments are required to understand the mechanism of inhibition by nickel. The catabolism of a 2 M ) has been shown to be inhibited after its covalent modification with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum w12,37,38x. This modification, which occurs away from the receptor binding site, has no significant effect on its binding to LRP. The modification, however, decreases the dissociation of a 2 M ) from the receptor in the endocytic vesicles w12x. In contrast, nickel appears to interact with the LRP and inhibits the binding of a 2 M ) to the receptor w23x. a 2 M ) catabolism is also inhibited by RAP, a universal antagonist that inhibits the catabolism of all the ligands of the LDL receptor family. In contrast to RAP, nickel appears to be a very specific inhibitor for the degradation of a 2 M ). Although unlikely, consideration was given to the possibility that a 2 M ) was catabolized by a LRP-independent pathway that is sensitive to nickel. This possibility was considered unlikely due to several reasons. a 2 M ) binds only to LRP and does not bind to the LDL receptor, VLDL receptor or gp330rmegalin w39≠41x. Zero or significantly reduced expression of LRP has been shown to result in decreased catabolism of a 2 M ) in fibroblasts w35x and in transgenic mice w20x. In contrast, deletion of the LDL receptor or VLDL receptor had no significant effect on a 2 M ) catabolism w20,42,43x. In the present investigation, we could not measure any significant degradation of a 2 M ) by the LRP-deficient fibroblasts in agreement with other studies w35x. Thus, the most of the a 2 M ) catabolism was mediated by the LRP. The degradation of RAP and lactoferrin was not inhibited by nickel. The binding affinity of RAP and lactoferrin to the LDL receptor is significantly less than LRP w43≠45x indicating that the LDL receptor is not the major receptor involved in the catabolism of RAP and lactoferrin in these cells. Several studies have established that LRP plays a very important role in the catabolism of RAP and lactoferrin w29,34,36,46≠48x. A more likely explanation for the lack of inhibition of RAP and lactoferrin degradation is that nickel binds to a site some distance away from the binding site of these ligands and thus does not interfere with their catabolism. The LDL receptor family is characterized by the

fact that each receptor recognizes more than one ligand and usually each ligand is recognized by more than one receptor. For example, ligands RAP, uPAPAI-1, lipoprotein lipase and lactoferrin are catabolized by the LRP, gp330rmegalin, chicken vitellogenin receptor and VLDL receptor w29,32,36,40,46,49≠ 54x. The only possible exception is that a 2 M ) is recognized only by the LRP w39≠41,45x. There are conflicting reports concerning the binding of a 2 M ) to the VLDL receptor probably due to species differences w39,40,55x. This indicates that the a 2 M ) binding site is unique and is only present in the LRP. In summary, we have demonstrated that nickel is a very specific inhibitor for the catabolism of a 2 M ). It had no effect on the cellular catabolism of RAP and lactoferrin. Although the physiologic significance of this observation is not obvious, the specificity and potency of its action suggest that nickel may be a useful and specific tool to identify the binding site of a 2 M ) to the LRP.
