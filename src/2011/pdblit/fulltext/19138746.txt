The A1AO ATP synthase from archaea represents a class of chimeric ATPases/synthases, whose function and general structural design share characteristics both with vacuolar V1VO ATPases and with F1FO ATP synthases. The primary sequences of the two large polypeptides A and B, from the catalytic part, are closely related to the eukaryotic V1VO ATPases. The chimeric nature of the A1AO ATP synthase from the archaeon ¨ Methanosarcina mazei Go1 was investigated in terms of nucleotide interaction. Here, we demonstrate the ability of the overexpressed A and B subunits to bind ADP and ATP by photoaffinity labeling. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to map the peptide of subunit B involved in nucleotide interaction. Nucleotide affinities in both subunits were determined by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, indicating a weaker binding of nucleotide analogues to subunit B than to A. In addition, the nucleotide-free crystal ° structure of subunit B is presented at 1.5 A resolution, providing the first view of the so-called non-catalytic subunit of the A1AO ATP synthase. Superposition of the A-ATP synthase non-catalytic B subunit and the F-ATP synthase non-catalytic a subunit provides new insights into the similarities and differences of these nucleotide-binding ATPase subunits in particular, and into nucleotide binding in general. The arrangement of subunit B within the intact A1AO ATP synthase is presented.

methane. This rather simple pathway is not coupled to substrate-level phosphorylation but, instead, to the generation of ion gradients across the membrane. These ion gradients are used to drive the synthesis of ATP, catalyzed by the archaea type A1AO ATP synthases (A-ATP synthase (1)). The membrane-integrated enzyme is composed of subunits A­K in the stoichiometry of A3:B3:C:D:E:F:G:H:I:Kx. Like the related bacterial F1FO ATP synthase (F-ATP synthase) (a3:b3:g:d:3:a:b2:cx) and the eukaryotic V1VO ATPase (V-ATPase) (A3:B 3:C:D:E:F:G 2 :H x :a:d:c x :c 0 x :c 00 x ), it possesses a water-soluble A1 domain, containing the catalytic sites, and an integral membrane AO domain, involved in ion translocation.1­3 The primary structure of the archaeal ATP synthase is very

726 similar to that of the V-ATPase, but its function as an ATP synthase is more similar to that of the F-ATP synthases. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that the ATP synthase from both Thermus thermophilus and Enterococcus hirae is of archaeal origin translocated by horizontal gene transfer,4­6 and are considered as A1AO ATP synthases herein. The major nucleotide-binding subunits A and B of the A1/V1 and the corresponding b and a subunits of the F1 domain display the highest degree of sequence similarity, with an overall identity of approximately 25%.4 The major difference between the A subunits of the A-ATP synthases/V-ATPases and the b subunit of F-ATP synthases is caused by the so-called "nonhomologous region", an insertion of about 90 amino acid residues near the N terminus of subunit A.4,5 The non-catalytic B subunits of the A-ATP synthases/V-ATPases do not have the consensus sequence (GXXGXGKTV), the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop), which is conserved at nucleotidebinding sites of the related a and b subunits of F-ATP synthases,7,8 and the catalytic A subunit of A1/V1.9­11 It has been shown that the A and B subunits of A1 and V1, and the a and b subunits of F1 form an alternating hexagonal arrangement around a central stalk.12­14 The pseudohexameric headpiece is attached to the AO/FO/VO part by the central and by one or more peripheral stalk(s).15­17 Image processing of electron micrographs of the negatively stained A1 ATPase from Methanosarcina ¨1 mazei Go revealed that the headpiece consists of a pseudohexagonal arrangement of six masses, surrounding a seventh mass.12 The hexagonal arrangement of subunits A and B encloses a cavity in which part of the central stalk subunit D is asymmetrically located. The stalk protrudes from the bottom side of the headpiece forming an angle of approximately 208 with the vertical axis of the molecule.12 Further insights into the topology of the A1 ATPase were obtained by differential protease sensitivity,18 and cross-linking studies.12,19 These studies resulted in a model in which the subunits C, D, and F form the central stalk domain. 12 A low-resolution structure of the complete A-ATP synthase was obtained recently by single-particle analyses of negatively stained molecules.15,20 These studies revealed novel structural features, such as a second peripheral stalk, and a collar-like structure at the base of the stalk. The membrane-embedded electrically driven motor (AO) is very different between archaea, due to varying subunit compositions and coupling stoichiometries that may reflect the differences in energy-converting mechanisms.1 Here, we have turned our attention to the examination of subunit A and B from M. mazei ¨ Go1, and sought to understand their nucleotidebinding characteristics using photoaffinity labeling and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). To this end, the X-ray crystal structure of the noncatalytic B subunit was determined and the atomic ° model at 1.5 A is presented.

Results
Expression and purification of subunits A and B We cloned the subunit A and B genes of the ¨ A-ATP synthase from M. mazei Go1 and overexpressed it in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the isolated proteins by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1(a)) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry revealed the high purity of the A and B subunits, and confirmed the sequence-based predicted mass of 65,710.5 Da and 52,707.0 Da, respectively. Nucleotide binding of subunits A and B A and B subunits of the methanogenic A-ATP synthase were proposed to possess nucleotidebinding sites.1 We tested the capability of both subunits to bind ATP using the photoaffinity ATP

727 laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDITOF) analysis allowed the identification of the peptide 336GIYPPINVLPSLSR349 with an additional mass of 1079 Da, indicating that the 8-N3-3 0 biotinyl-ATP was bound as a tri-triethylammonium salt (Figure 2). Nucleotide-binding of subunit A and B characterized by FCS Binding of fluorescent ATP and ADP derivatives to subunits A and B was investigated by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). In FCS, the non-bound nucleotides exhibit short diffusion times through the confocal observation volume, as they are small molecules. After binding to the subunits, the effective mass is increased, and the diffusion times become longer. The characteristic diffusion time, tD, for subunit B was measured as a reference by selective labeling of the protein with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR). The diffusion times of the labeled protein were compared to that of the fluorescent ADP-derivative Atto-532ADP (Figure 3(a) and (b)). Fitting of the autocorrelation functions resulted in characteristic times of diffusion tDZ2.68 ms for B-TMR, tDZ0.75 ms for Atto-532-ADP, and tDZ0.47 ms for rhodamine 6G (R6G; data not shown). Approximating the shape of a subunit as a sphere can be used to estimate the diffusion time of the bound nucleotide, as this scales with M1/3. By calculating the ratio RMZ42 for the molecular masses of subunit B and Atto-532-ADP, respectively, the expected ratio of the corresponding diffusion times is 3.5, which is in good agreement with the experimental ratio of 3.6. Figure 3(a) shows the normalized autocorrelation functions of the fluorescent analogues Atto-532ATP and Atto-532-ADP in the absence and in the presence of subunit A. The addition of subunit A

analogue 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP, which reacts predominantly with nucleophilic groups.21 Figure 1(a) shows the result of irradiation of subunit A (lane 2) and B (lane 5) in the presence of Mg-8-N3-3 0 biotinyl-ATP. Bound photoaffinity label was detected by Western blotting, using streptavidin raised against the biotinylated analogue. Although Mg-8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP could label both subunits, significantly lower amounts of nucleotide analogues were incorporated into the B subunit. To test whether labeling could be protected by the natural substrate, MgATP was added before the labeling procedure. As shown in Figure 1(a) (lanes 4 and 7), the presence of MgATP prevents binding of Mg-8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP to either subunit. Also, irradiation of both subunits in the absence of the label did not result in labeling of these proteins (lanes 1 and 8), indicating the specific covalent binding of 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP by subunits A and B. Irradiation of subunit A in the presence of Mg-8N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ADP (lanes 3 and 6), resulted in strong covalent binding of the nucleotide analogue, whereas the binding of subunit B under the same conditions was significantly weaker. In order to investigate whether the nucleotide labeling in the single A and B subunits occurs in the whole complex, and whether the nucleotide-binding nature of both subunits is common to other sources, the interaction of Mg-8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP with the A-ATP synthase from Methanococcus jannaschii was studied. As shown in Figure 1(b), Mg-8-N3-3 0 biotinyl-ATP labels both subunits A and B, but shows a preference for A, indicating similar binding characteristics of isolated subunits, and subunits incorporated in the intact complex. A more detailed localization of the label in subunit B could be achieved by MALDI mass spectrometry. Tryptic digestion of labeled subunit ¨ B from M. mazei Go1 followed by matrix-assisted

resulted in a significant change of the mean diffusion time tD for Atto-532-ATP. For different concentrations of subunit A, fitting the autocorrelation functions with two diffusion times, one for the free and one for the bound ATP derivatives, resulted in increasing amplitudes for the slowdiffusing component (up to 20% for Atto-532-ATP). This confirmed that Atto-532-ATP was bound to subunit A. Using the diffusion coefficient, DZ2.8! 10K6 cm2/s, for R6G in water,22 the relation tDZu2/ 0 4D between the radial 1/e2 radius (u0Z0.73 mm), and the characteristic translational diffusion time, tD, the translational diffusion coefficient, D, of Atto532-ATP in the absence of subunit A and B-TMR was determined to be 1.8(G0.2)!10K6 cm2/s and 4.9(G0.4)!10K7 cm2/s, respectively. By comparison, when Atto-532-ADP was used, the mean diffusion time also increased up to 8% in the presence of the highest concentration (84.2 mM) of subunit A (Figure 3(a)). The diffusion coefficient, D, of Atto-532-ADP was calculated to be 1.8(G 0.2)!10K6 cm2/s as reported previously.23 FCS measurements of Atto-532-ATP and Atto-532-ADP in the presence of subunit B showed no binding of the fluorescent analogues (Figure 3(b)). In order to determine whether this may be caused by a steric effect of the bulky Atto-532-ATP, the fluorescent ATP-analogue, BODIPY-FL-ATP, was used, which resulted in an increase of the mean diffusion time (data not shown). Approximately 12% of BODIPYFL-ATP was bound to subunit B, compared to 37% bound to subunit A for similar conditions. A binding constant of about 1.6 mM for bound BODIPY-FL-ATP to subunit B was calculated (Figure 3(c)). By comparison, a binding constant of about 55 mM and 400 mM of bound BODIPY-FL-ATP and Atto-532-ATP to subunit A, respectively, were determined, demonstrating the effect of the bulky ATP-analogue, Atto-532-ATP, and the higher affinity of subunit A for nucleotides. Structure determination of subunit B In order to get a detailed picture of subunit B, the ° structure of this protein was determined to 1.5 A resolution (Figure 4). A summary of the data collection, phasing, and structure refinement statistics is shown in Tables 1 and 2. The protein crystallized in space group P212121, containing two molecules of subunit B per asymmetric unit arranged in a head to tail orientation (termed chain A and chain B). There is no interpretable density for amino acid residues 1­12, 57­70 or 456­460 in chain A, while residues 1­12, 57­70 and 259­271 are disordered or only poorly defined in chain B. Overall, the quality of the electron density is good and the majority of the side-chains are clearly defined. The r.m.s. deviation of the two monomers in the non-crystallographic dimer is ° ° 1.04 A, with main differences of up to 12.8 A in the two loop regions containing residues Ser304 to Leu317 and Leu256 to Thr278, indicating the high degree of flexibility of these loops (Figure 7(a)).

a protease inhibitor during the purification procedure, might be a more likely source of the density. Overall architecture ° The dimensions of subunit B are 50 A across and ° in length. The subunit is composed of three 80 A domains, an N-terminal six-stranded b barrel (residues 13­76), an intermediate a-b domain (residues 77­358), and a C-terminal four a-helical bundle (residues 359­460) (Figures 4 and 6). The a-b domain consists of a nine-stranded b sheet surrounded by seven a helices. Although the a/b fold is similar to the nucleotide-binding fold found in the nucleotide-binding domains of the a and b subunits of F-ATP synthases, the P-loop motif7,8 is not conserved in subunit B of A-ATP synthases at the equivalent position.9,10 A sequence alignment of subunit B from A and V-ATPases shows that there is a conserved motif, GXGXGKT, which is 195 residues downstream of the expected site in ¨ M. mazei Go1 subunit B, forming the loop that connects the middle and C-terminal domains (Figure 6). This loop (Gly354­Thr360) is about ° 30 A away from Tyr338 of the 8-N3-3 0 -biotinylATP-labeled peptide, which would preferentially interact with the azido group of the nucleotide analogue. The overall structure of subunit B is similar to that of the related non-catalytic a subunits of the bovine F1 ATPase (Figure 7(b)).13 Both subunits ° superimpose with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.83 A. Differences are pronounced in the N-terminal b-barrel, the loop of the peptide Pro306­Asp316 of the a-b domain, the conserved glycine-rich region of subunit B (Gly354­Thr360) and the region following residue His435 in the C-terminal domain. While the intermediate domains of both subunits are of approximately the same size, the N and C-terminal domains of subunit B are shorter than in subunit a, leading to an overall more compact appearance of subunit B. This might contribute to a greater thermostability of subunit B. Superposition ¨ of the M. mazei Go1 A-ATP synthase non-catalytic subunit B with the Pyrococcus horikoshii catalytic subunit A (PDB 1vdz) resulted in an r.m.s. deviation ° of 2.1 A (Figure 7(d)). Obvious differences are in the so-called non-homologous region, an extension of about 90 amino acid residues near the N terminus of the catalytic A subunit of A-ATP synthases and V-ATPases.4,5 Similar to the comparison with the a subunit, the extended loop of the peptide Pro306­Asp316 of the a-b domain and the conserved glycine-rich region of subunit B are not present in subunit A. On the other hand, the conformation of the a-helical bundle in the C-terminal domain that contains the so-called catch-residues (Lys365­Lys410) is remarkably similar in both superpositions. This region contacts the central stalk and is thought to be responsible for transmitting the conformational changes from stalk to nucleotide-binding subunits and vice versa (I.S. & G.G., unpublished results).

In the intact complex they would face the central stalk subunit D,12 which rotates during catalysis and might therefore require a flexible interaction in this area.24 The N-terminal domain also shows larger than average deviations. Although co-crystallization experiments were carried out in the presence of 2 mM MgAMP$PNP, no nucleotide was visible in the electron density, which might be due to the crystallization conditions used. One of the two molecules (chain B) in the asymmetric unit shows an additional density at Lys20, making close contacts with residues Asp409 to Arg413 and His333 to Tyr338 of chain A (Figure 5). This density has the shape of a tyrosine residue, which would be in line with an additional mass peak found at 52,707.0 Da plus 181 Da in the MALDI spectrum.

Localization of the subunits inside the A-ATP synthase The X-ray coordinates of the atomic models of subunit A (P. horikoshii, PDB 1vdz) and the M. mazei ¨ Go1 subunit B were fitted into the electron density map of the A-ATP synthase from T. thermophilus,20 obtained from single-particle analysis of negatively stained electron micrographs (Figure 8). The nonhomologous region of subunit A allowed a clear orientation of the three A subunits inside the map. After fitting the A subunits, density at all atomic positions was set to zero with the program emfit.25 This allowed the fitting of subunit B into the remaining density. A previous fitting of the F-ATPase a3b3 complex into the 3D reconstruction of the A-ATPase had shown that each of the peripheral stalks interacted with the A1 headpiece at a subunit interface and therefore were in direct contact with both the A and B subunits.20 That fitting, however, was done with the a3b3 complex as a rigid body, such that the conformational states were preserved and used as a distinguishing feature for the correct fit. The new fit described here identifies the portion of unfilled density on top of the structure as part of the external stator. Although information about the location of the conformational states is lost, fitting the A-type subunits A and B provides a more accurate pseudoatomic model of the A-ATPase than that resulting from the use of the F-ATPase a3b3 coordinates.

nucleotides. While nucleotide-binding studies on the single major subunits A and B of the T. thermophilus A-ATP synthase revealed that only subunit A is capable of binding nucleotides,26 photoaffinity labeling with 2-N3-ATP of the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius A1-ATPase indicated that both A and B are labeled, but with a preference for the A polypeptide.27 Here, irradiation in the continuous presence of either Mg-8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP or -ADP, results in labeling of the individual A and B subunits of the ¨1 M. mazei Go A-ATP synthase and in labeling of both subunits in the M. jannaschii enzyme. This indicates the generality of nucleotide binding to both subunits in the methanogenic A-ATP synthases. The photosensitive nucleotides, together with the fluorescent ADP and ATP analogues, demonstrate the higher affinity of subunit A for nucleotides, and that nucleotide binding depends on the size of the nucleotide analogue used. Since methanogens are found in extreme environments with respect to temperature, pH and/or salt concentration, temperature might be an additional parameter of nucleotide binding of the A and B polypeptides. This was shown in experiments with the Sulfolobus A-ATP synthase,27 which demonstrated that the total number of six occupied sites is accessible only at high temperature, whereas at lower temperatures the enzyme assumes a kind of "frozen state". This might partially explain the low binding constants determined for subunits A and B under the conditions described here.

Mutations of this Lys residue in both the a and b subunits drastically impaired catalytic activity in

the b subunits,35­37 but had only small effects when substituted in the non-catalytic a subunits.38 It might be feasible that the positive charge of His156 in subunit B takes on the role of the conserved lysine residue in the P-loop (Figure 7(c)). Near the P-loop, the nucleotide-binding domain of the a and b subunits of F-ATP synthase accommodates an additional loop (termed GER-loop in subunit b), which is responsible for nucleotide binding and catalysis.13,29,30 Such a loop is present also at

a corresponding position in the structure of subunit B, where it is formed by the sequence 184GIT186, which is conserved in A-ATP synthases (Figures 6 and 7(c)).10 The Glu residue of the GER-loop in subunit b is proposed to stabilize the transition state during cleavage of ATP. Substitution by a Gln residue reduces ATP hydrolysis of the F-ATPase by three or more orders of magnitude without significant effect on nucleotide binding.38 Since a

Gln residue occupies a position equivalent to the Glu residue in the a subunits, it has been argued that the absence of the catalytic carboxylate in the corresponding loop would explain the lack of catalytic activity.13,39 Quite remarkably, the corresponding region in the V-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (175SASGLPHN182) is identical with the 150SASGLPHN157-loop sequence of the M. mazei ¨ Go 1 B subunit.

735 covalent modification of the non-catalytic site by BzATP does lead to inactivation of the enzyme, and nucleotide binding to this site is affected by changes occurring at the catalytic and non-catalytic sites of the complex.33 In the case of the methanogenic A-ATP synthase, subunit B is in close contact to the catalytic A subunit via the A-B interface, with subunit D, which penetrates into the A3:B3 hexamer, and with the stalk subunit F, which is suggested to be part of the rotor shaft inside the A1-ATPase.24 This F subunit can be crosslinked in high yield with subunit B of the A-ATP synthase, when the complex is supplemented with MgAMP-PNP or MgATP, using EDC (1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) as a chemical crosslinker (I.S. & G.G., unpublished results), indicating the coupling of nucleotide binding in the non-catalytic site with structural alterations in the neighboring subunits B and F. The fitting of subunit B inside the 3D reconstruction of the A-ATP synthase in Figure 8 indicates that this subunit is also in contact with both peripheral stalks, which stabilize the enzyme. In summary, the first three-dimensional structure of the non-catalytic B subunit of the A-ATP synthase provides a structural basis towards an understanding of the similarities to and differences from the non-catalytic a subunit of F-ATP synthase. Moreover, it gives implications for the structural features of the more closely related B subunit of the V-ATPase, which also lacks the conserved P-loop motif. This motif has been used to characterize proteins that have diverged from a common ancestor. Conversely, shared common sequences are not found in all ATP-binding proteins,8,41,42 indicating that there is no universal fingerprint for ATP binding.

sequence in the yeast V-ATPase B subunit by replacement of residues His180 or Asn182 with cysteine led to about 25% of ATPase activity and proton transport loss, whereas mutations of residues Ser176 or Pro180 caused a more dramatic reduction in activity (55­60%).33 These tend to support the view that the GXXGXGKTV sequence does not characterize all ATP-binding sites. For example, E1/E2-type ATPases, actin, tubulin and the glycolytic kinases, are all known to bind ATP while lacking a P-loop motif.8 Since we were not able to co-crystallize subunit B with a nucleotide analogue, we can only speculate whether the similar architecture and position of both loops in the structure of a, b and the B subunit represent conserved and defined folding features of functional domains involved in nucleotide binding. Whether it is the primary rather than the tertiary structure that defines a subunit as a catalytic or a non-catalytic subunit as described for the catalytic b and the non-catalytic a subunits in F-ATPases, respectively,13,39 needs to be further investigated. Investigation of other putative nucleotidebinding sites in subunit B As pointed out above, the P-loop motif is not conserved at the equivalent position in subunit B of A-ATP synthases. However, a related motif, 354GXGXGKT360, is located some 150 residues downstream of the P-loop in the a subunit and b subunits of F-ATPases.13 This related motif is about ° 30 A away from Tyr338 of the Mg-8-N3-3 0 -biotinylATP labeled peptide. The side-chain of this residue points towards the interface that would be formed by the neighboring A subunit within the intact complex. Recently, labeling experiments using 8-azido-[a- 32P]ATP of subunit B from the E. hirae A-ATP synthase identified a peptide with two tyrosine residues (Tyr412 and Tyr418).40 Both residues would be far away from the 150SASGLPHN157 loop as well as from the 354GXGXGKT360 sequence in the related structure of ¨ subunit B from M. mazei Go1. Binding of the natural nucleotide ATP results in an anti-conformation, while the 8-N3-ATP-analogues most likely adopt a syn-conformation, and might therefore influence the selectivity of incorporation.21 Nevertheless, Tyr338 of the Mg-8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP-labeled peptide comes close to the corresponding nucleotidebinding pocket of the a and b subunits of F-ATP synthases, implying that the nucleotide-binding site in the B subunit of A-ATP synthase might be in a position similar to that of the binding pockets of the a and b subunits in F-ATP synthases. Structural alterations in A1AO ATP synthase due to nucleotide binding in subunit B An important question that remains to be answered for both V-ATPases and F-/A-ATP synthases is the function of nucleotide binding to the non-catalytic a and B subunits. In V-ATPases,

Materials and Methods
Biochemicals ProofStarte DNA polymerase and Ni2C-NTA-chromatography resin were from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany); restriction enzymes were purchased from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The expression vector pET9dHis6 was provided by G. Stier, EMBL (Heidelberg, Germany). Chemicals for gel electrophoresis were acquired from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Bovine serum albumin was purchased from GERBU Biochemicals (Heidelberg, Germany). All other chemicals were of at least analytical grade and were from BIOMOL (Hamburg, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), or Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Cloning, production and protein purification The genes, encoding subunit A and B from M. mazei ¨ Go1 were amplified using the oligonucleotide primers: forward 5 0 -TTTCCATGGAAGTAAAAGGTGAAATTTA-3 0 reverse 5 0 -TTTTTTTGAGCTCTTATTTACCTCCCA-3 0

or forward 5 0 -TTTCTCCATGGTCAAAGAGTACAAGA-3 0 reverse 5 0 -TTTGAGCTCTCACTTAGCCTTTCTGT-3 0 respectively, thereby incorporating the NcoI, and SacI restriction sites (underlined). The genomic DNA ¨ from M. mazei Go1 (ATCC: #43340, DSMZ-Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorgansimen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany) was used as the template. Following digestion with NcoI and SacI, the PCR products were ligated into the pET9d-His6 vector. Afterwards, the pET9d-His6 vectors containing either the subunit A or B insert were transformed into E. coli cells (strain BL21) and grown on 30 mg mlK1 kanamycin-containing LuriaBertoni (LB) agar-plates. To express the His6-tagged subunits A and B, liquid cultures were shaken in LB medium containing kanamycin (30 mg mlK1) for about 20 h at 30 8C until an absorbance at 600 nm (A600) of 0.6­0.7 was reached. To induce production of His6-A and His6-B, the cultures were supplemented with isopropyl-bD-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM. Following incubation for another 4 h at 30 8C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000g for 20 min at 4 8C. Selenomethionine-containing protein was expressed in the same way, except that methionine biosynthesis was inhibited by the growth conditions.43 A 1:1000 preculture in LB medium was used to inoculate 300 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 30 mg mlK1 kanamycin, vitamins and trace elements. After growth overnight, the culture was diluted 1:100 into 10 l of minimal medium. After an A 600 of 0.6 was reached, 100 mg l K1 K1 DL-selenomethionine (Fisher), 100 mg l lysine, threoK1 nine and phenylalanine and 50 mg l leucine, isoleucine and valine were added as solids. IPTG (to 1 mM) was added after 15 min, and cells were grown for 3 h and harvested as described above. Cells expressing His6-A and His6-B were lysed on ice by sonication for 3!1 min in buffer A (50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM Pefabloc SC (BIOMOL) and buffer B (20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mM NaCl, 4 mM Pefabloc SC), respectively. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 8C, the supernatant was passed through a filter (0.45 mm poresize) and supplemented with Ni2C-NTA resin. The Histagged subunits A and B were allowed to bind to the matrix for 90 min at 4 8C, and eluted with an imidazolegradient (25­200 mM) in buffer A and B, respectively, by mixing on a sample rotator (Neolab). Fractions containing His 6-tagged subunit A or B were identified by SDS-PAGE,44 and pooled. In the case of subunit A, the fractions were subsequently applied to a size-exclusion column (Superdex S-75 column), equilibrated in buffer A. The fractions containing subunit B were applied to an ion-exchange column (Resource Q (40 ml), Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 20 mM Tris­HCl (pH 8.1), 50 mM NaCl. The protein was eluted by a linear gradient of 50 mM­1 M NaCl. Methods for selenomethionine protein purification were identical with those for the unsubstituted protein, with the exception that all Ni2C-NTA buffers were supplemented with 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol and all other buffers were supplemented with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The purity of the protein samples was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectrometry. The SDS-gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G250. The methanogenic A-ATP synthase of M. jannaschii was purified by sucrose density centrifugation and anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-Sepharose) as

Structural Features of Subunit B of the A1AO ATP Synthase ¨ described,45 and provided by Professor V. Muller (Johann ¨ Wolfgang-Goethe Universitat, Frankfurt, Germany). ATPase-active fractions were pooled and concentrated on Centricon 100 kDa concentrators (Millipore). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a Superose 6 column (10/30, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 50 mM Tris­HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Pefabloc SC (BIOMOL).15 The peak fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchonic acid assay (BCA; Pierce, Rockford, IL. USA). Photoaffinity labeling Photoaffinity labeling was performed as described,46 using the nucleotide analogue 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP (8-azido-3 0 (2 0 )-biotinyl adenosine 5 0 -triphosphate) or 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ADP, obtained as triethylammonium salt by freeze drying. Subunits A and B were incubated with 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP or 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ADP and MgCl2 in buffer A or buffer B, respectively, for 5 min at 4 8C in the dark, followed by irradiation with an ultraviolet lamp at 366 nm for 30 min on ice. The protein sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G250. The identification of the labeled subunits was done by Western immunoblots as described,47 using a streptavidin/POD conjugate for the visualization of the biotinylated proteins. The 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP and 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl¨ ADP was a generous gift from Professor H.-J. Schafer ¨ (Johannes-Gutenberg Universitat, Mainz, Germany). Tryptic digest and MALDI-TOF analysis The 8-N3-3 0 -biotinyl-ATP labeled band of subunit B was cut from the gel and destained overnight with a solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 40% (v/v) ethanol. The protein was digested in the gel with trypsin (Promega) as described,48 except that the bands had been washed three times with acetonitrile before drying them in a speed vacuum concentrator. Digested samples were desalted with a C18ZipTip (Millipore) and eluted with CHCA (10 mg mlK1 a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) or FA (8 mg mlK1 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) matrix solution. A sample (1­2 ml) of the matrix-analyte solution was spotted onto the MALDI plate and allowed to dry.49 Peptide mass mapping was performed by matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) using a Bruker Reflex IIIe MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). The peptide map was acquired in reflectron positive-ion mode with delayed extraction at a mass range of 100­5000 Da. The instrument was calibrated using a calibration mixture (Applied Biosystems). For interpretation of the protein fragments, the PEPTIDEMASS50 program available at the Expasy web site was used. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) was performed at room temperature on a custom-designed confocal microscope (based on an Olympus IX71 stage)  www.expasy.ch/tools/peptide-mass.html

Structural Features of Subunit B of the A1AO ATP Synthase ¨ similar to that described by Armbruster et al.23 using the ATP and ADP-analogues BODIPY-FL-ATP (BODIPYw FL 2 0 -(or-3 0 )-O-(N-(2-aminoethyl)urethane) adenosine 5 0 -triphosphate; Molecular Probes), Atto-532-ATP, (Atto-tec, Siegen, Germany) and Atto-532-ADP. Briefly, the 488 nm laser line of an argon ion laser (Spectra Physics model 2020-03 S) or the 532 nm laser line of a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG (Compass 315M-100; coherent) were attenuated to 100 mW and focused into the aqueous solution by a water immersion objective (UApo/340, 40!, N.A. 1.15; Olympus). FCS was measured in 40 ml droplets of the diluted fluorescent derivatives of ATP or ADP, which were placed on the glass cover-slip. In epi-fluorescence configuration, a dichroic mirror suppressed scattered ¨ laser light (c488-RDC or z532-RDC; AHF, Tubingen, Germany). Interference filters (HQ 532/70 or HQ 585/ 80; AHF) blocked the Raman signals in front of the single photon-counting avalanche photodiode (SPCM AQR-14; Perkin Elmer). Out-of-focus fluorescence was rejected by a 100 nm pinhole in the detection pathway, resulting in confocal detection volumes between 5 fl and 15 fl. Fluorescence autocorrelation functions were measured for 5 min each using a hardware correlator device (PC card ALV 5000 E; ALV, Langen, Germany). Alternatively, autocorrelation functions were calculated by software using the program Burst Analyzer.51 Therefore, the time trajectories of the single photons were registered in parallel with a PC card for time-correlated single photon counting (SPC-630; Becker&Hickl, Berlin, Germany) with 50 ns time-resolution. Solutions of rhodamine 6 G or rhodamine 110 in pure water (Simplicity 185; Millipore) were used as references for the calibration of the confocal microscope. To analyze the autocorrelation functions of fluorescent nucleotides bound, in part, to the subunits A and B, models with two diffusion times and one triplet state were used for fitting as described.52,53 Triplet lifetime and amplitudes were kept at the pre-measured values in the absence of binding proteins. The diffusion times of fluorescent nucleotides and fluorescently labeled subunits were measured independently, and were kept fixed during the fitting of the FCS data. Therefore, the determination of the binding constants required only the calculation of the relative amounts of free nucleotides with the short diffusion time and of the bound nucleotides with the diffusion time of the subunit. Fluorescent impurities in the buffer solutions were removed by adding activated charcoal granula (Merck) and stirring vigorously for several hours. Crystallization of subunit B Sitting drops were prepared by 1:1 (v/v) mixing of 12 mg mlK1 subunit B in buffer B (see above) with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M citrate (pH 5.5), and incubated at 18 8C. DTT (10 mM) was included for selenomethionyl crystallization and 2 mM MgAMP$PNP was included for co-crystallization. Crystals were cryoprotected with 20% glycerol in crystallization buffer and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Structure determination Single-wavelength datasets of a crystal of subunit B ° co-crystallized with MgAMP$PNP (MAP, 1.5 A resolution) and of a selenomethionine-containing crystal without ° nucleotide (SeMet, 1.8 A resolution) were collected at K180 8C on beamline ID14-4 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) using a

737
wavelength near a selenium X-ray absorption edge ° (0.9795 A). Data were integrated with MOSFLM,54 and scaled using SCALA.55 Selenium sites were identified and refined using SOLVE,56 and density modification of the experimental map was performed with RESOLVE.57 Large parts of the electron density were traced automatically using ARP/wARP,58 and missing parts were completed manually using MAIN.59 Crystallographic refinement of the model was carried out in iterative cycles using refmac5,60 and Coot.61 No non-crystallographic (NCS) restraint was put on the NCS-related molecules during refinement. Fitting of A and B subunits into the electron microscope (EM) density ¨ X-ray coordinates for the M. mazei Go1 subunit B, the P. horikoshii subunit A (PDB 1vdz),62 the bovine g subunit (PDB 1E79),63 the T. thermophilus C subunit (PDB 1R5Z)64 and the E. coli c12 ring NMR model (PDB 1C17),65 were fitted into the electron density map of the A-ATP synthase from T. thermophilus as described.20 The fitting was done using the program EMfit,25 which uses the average value of the density at all atomic sites in the fitted protein (sumf) and the lack of atoms in negative density as a criterion for fitting. To allow the best fit possible for subunit B, which lacks clear distinguishing features, subunit A was fitted first to ensure an unambiguous fit. The non-homologous region of subunit A protrudes from the structure and allowed a clear orientation of the three A subunits within ° the map. All density within a radius of 8 A of all Ca atoms was set to zero, effectively removing all density corresponding to subunit A. This difference output map was then used as input for fitting subunit B into the remaining density. Protein Data Bank accession codes Atomic coordinates and structure factors for subunit B have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession codes 2c61 and r2c61sf, respectively.
