T cell receptors (TCRs) have traditionally been viewed as receptors for peptide antigens presented by either Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I (for CD8 T cells) or MHC class II (for CD4 T cells) antigen-presenting molecules. However, it is now clear that some T cell lineages express TCRs that are specialized for recognition of lipid-based antigens presented by the MHC class I-like CD1 family. Recently, the molecular basis for the TCR recognition of glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d has revealed an evolutionarily conserved-docking mode that is distinct from that of peptide-based recognition. T cells carrying these receptors follow a unique developmental pathway that results not only in unconventional antigen specificity, but also seemingly exaggerated functional capabilities, which makes these cells and their antigens highly attractive targets for immunotherapeutic manipulation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

1. CD1-restricted, lipid antigen-reactive T cells Of the many different types of non-conventional T cells that have been identified, the CD1d-restricted NKT cell lineage is the most extensively studied. Like conventional T cells, NKT cells express a TCR derived from randomly rearranged TCR- and TCRchains, but nonetheless, the NKT TCR has exquisite specificity for lipid-based antigens presented by CD1d. Two broad classes of CD1d-restricted NKT cells exist: Type 1 NKT cells, defined by their invariant TCR- chain (V 14-J 18 in mice, V 24-J 18 in humans) and limited TCR- repertoire (V 8.2, V 7 and V 2 in mice, V 11 in humans) and their reactivity with the glycosphingolipid antigen -galactosylceramide ( -GalCer) (reviewed in [1]). Type 2 NKT cells, while being CD1d restricted, do not express the invariant TCR- chain that characterises Type 1 NKT cells and do not react with -GalCer. While Type 2 NKT cells are less-well understood, they appear to be a heterogeneous collection of cells that seem to encompass some TCR biases (reviewed in [1,2]). Within the Type 2 NKT cell pool, V 3 and V 8 are over-represented, usually in conjunction with V 8, although other TCR chains have also been detected in this population [3,4]. Furthermore, other T cell lineages express TCRs that recognise lipid-based antigens presented by CD1a, CD1b and CD1c [5]. While CD1-restricted T cell lineages

are typically less abundant than their MHC-I- or MHC-II-restricted counterparts, their unique specificity, their distinct functional characteristics and their remarkable evolutionary conservation across species (as exemplified by the CD1d system), suggests that these cells have a non-redundant role in the immune system. 2. Diversity of lipid antigen recognition by NKT cells Although CD1d is described as "MHC-like", CD1 molecules are adapted to bind lipid-based Ags rather than peptides [6­8]. Hence, in contrast to the hydrophilic Ag-binding cleft of MHC-I molecules, the corresponding region within CD1d is hydrophobic, comprising two large internal channels, designated A and F pockets. In each case, the lipid tails of the Ag are largely embedded in the hydrophobic cleft of CD1d, whereas the polar head group protrudes from the cleft, representing a potential antigenic target for CD1d-restricted T cells. The loading of these lipid antigens is a specialized intracellular process involving specific chaperones such as saposins (reviewed elsewhere [9]). Understanding the antigen specificity of NKT cells is central to our ability to manipulate their function. There is a growing list of CD1-restricted lipid antigens that act as T cell agonists. For CD1d-restricted Type 1 NKT cells, the first, and still most widely studied, is -GalCer. The list of antigens that stimulate Type 1 NKT cells now includes a range of synthetic analogues of -GalCer that carry structural modifications, that seem to differentially influence the functional response of NKT cells (Fig. 1). For example, two synthetic analogues, OCH ( -GalCer with a truncated sphingosine chain) and C20:2 ( -GalCer with a di-unsaturated acyl

chain), tend to promote a Th2 (IL-4 dominant) response following in vivo challenge [10,11] whereas -C-GalCer ( -GalCer with a carbon rather than oxygen based glycosidic linkage) promotes a Th1 (IFNdominant) response following in vivo challenge [12]. Although these are synthetic analogues that may not occur in nature, they nonetheless demonstrate the important ability to manipulate the NKT cell response in a particular direction as desired. A number of bacterial antigens are known to activate NKT cells, including -glucuronosyl- and -galacturonosylceramides (collectively known as -glycuronosylceramides) from Sphingomonas bacteria [13­15], and -galactosyl-diacylglycerol from Borrelia burgdorferi [16]. Mammalian agonists have also been described, the best known example being isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) [17], but others include -galactosylceramide, -glucosylceramide [18,19] and the disialoganglioside GD3 [20]. While the specificity and function of Type 2 NKT cells is less-well understood, one glycolipid antigen that activates these cells is sulfatide, a mammalian sulfated -GalCer analogue that has the ability to promote Type 2 NKT cell dependent immunosuppression [21­23]. Type 2 NKT cells can also respond to non-glycolipid antigens such as lysophos-

phatidylcholine [24] and even non-lipidic small molecules [25] (Fig. 1). 3. TCR-driven development of CD1d-restricted NKT cells How non-conventional T cell lineages are generated is a central question and most of our understanding of this comes from the example of CD1d-restricted Type 1 NKT cells (for a comprehensive review, see [26]). TCR specificity is the driving factor behind Type 1 NKT cell (hereafter referred to simply as NKT cells) development. Like other T cells, the NKT TCR is generated by random TCR gene rearrangement that occurs in the thymus. Developing CD4+CD8+ double positive thymocytes (DP), having already productively rearranged their TCR- chain genes at the CD4-CD8- double negative (DN) thymocyte stage, are in the process of rearranging their TCRchain genes and expressing TCRs on their cell surface. This is how they are tested for self-MHC-restriction/self-reactivity, via positive selection, that results in cell survival and CD4/CD8 lineage commitment. DP that express a TCR that is strongly self-reactive are deleted via the process of negative selection, thus purging the T

Fig. 2. TCR-CD1d interaction in the thymus drives NKT cell development. Developing CD4+CD8+ thymocytes receive positive selection signals following TCR engagement. TCR interaction with MHC-II plus peptide antigen expressed by thymic epithelial cells drives CD4 T cell development, TCR interaction with MHC-I plus peptide antigen expressed by thymic epithelial cells drives CD8 T cell development and TCR interaction with CD1d plus glycolipid antigen expressed by other CD4+CD8+ thymocytes drives NKT cell development.

cell repertoire of dangerously autoreactive cells. DP that bind with low to moderate affinity to MHC-I or MHC-II expressed by thymic epithelial cells are ultimately directed to become conventional CD8 or CD4 T cells respectively (reviewed in [27]). NKT cells are thought to arise when, occasionally, a DP thymocyte randomly produces a TCR that binds to CD1d expressed by other DP thymocytes (Fig. 2). This interaction drives these cells down a separate pathway leading to the NKT cell lineage [26,28]. Notably, most NKT cells lack the CD8 co-receptor and many also lack the CD4 co-receptor, hence, mature NKT cells in mice are either CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8- DN. In humans, DN NKT cells tend to predominate, although CD4+ and, to a lesser extent, CD8+ NKT cells are also present. This lack of stringent co-receptor expression by NKT cells reflects the lack of a typical CD8 or CD4-binding site on CD1d molecules. Therefore, it is perhaps surprising that co-receptor interactions by very early DP NKT cells [29] with conventional MHC molecules on thymic epithelial cells do not subvert NKT selection into the conventional MHC-restricted T cell pool. It is possible the relatively high affinity of NKT TCRs for CD1d/glycolipid might partly compensate for the lack of co-receptor interactions by NKT cells. The absence of CD8 on most NKT cells, and of CD4 on many NKT cells, might also explain the apparent lack of alloreactivity of NKT cells on MHCallogeneic antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Why interaction with CD1d has such a major impact on the fate of these developing T cells has been a central question, but it seems to be due to different signals that are provided by the selecting cells (thymic epithelial cells for conventional T cells, DP thymocytes for NKT cells). In particular, DP thymocytes that mediate NKT cell selection express members of the SLAM family, and these are engaged when NKT cell precursors interact with their selecting cell [30,31]. The ensuing signalling cascade, via a series of intracellular proteins including: SLAM adaptor protein (SAP), the tyrosine kinase fyn, and downstream signalling factors including PKC and the classical NF B pathway, are all necessary for normal NKT cell development yet dispensable for conventional T cell development (reviewed in [26,32]). Many developmental steps have been mapped along the way for NKT cell development (reviewed in [26]). At least one of these steps, associated with NKT cell maturation where NK1.1 is upreg-

ulated (also known as control point 2, in contrast to control point 1 where NKT cells are first selected), is also CD1d dependent and therefore seems to be another checkpoint to determine whether the developing NKT cells express a CD1d-specific TCR [33]. Thus, CD1d-dependent NKT cells arise at quite a late stage in T cell development as a result of their random TCR gene rearrangement. The TCR- chain rearrangement seems to be the primary factor and almost invariably involves V 14 (V 24 in humans) rearranged to J 18, with a specific CDR3 junctional sequence that can vary at the nucleotide level but not at the amino acid level [34]. This, combined with the fact that the non-expressed, but still rearranged, TCR- alleles in NKT cells contain a random mixture of V and J genes [35], indicates that the invariant TCR- chain is selected rather than the result of a programmed rearrangement. While NKT TCRs are often described as invariant, it is important to recognise that while the TCR- chain is largely invariant, NKT TCR- chains are more diverse. In mice, at least three different V genes (V 8.2, V 7 and V 2) can be paired with a range of J genes, generating considerable diversity at the complementarity determining regions (CDR), especially CDR3 . In humans, most NKT cells use V 11, but the J /CDR3 regions are also diverse [34]. A missing link in the TCR mediated selection of NKT cells is the nature of the selecting antigen that is presented by CD1d in the thymus. The existence of such an antigen is supported by several observations: lysosomal processing and transfer of glycolipids to CD1d is required for NKT cell selection [36,37]; mutant (tail truncated) CD1d that can reach the cell membrane at normal levels but cannot traffic to lysosomes to exchange glycolipid antigens is unable to promote NKT cell selection [38]; antagonists of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis inhibit NKT cell development, yet have no effect on conventional T cell development [39]. However, identifying the selecting antigen has proven to be difficult. A strong candidate was isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) [17], which is a mammalian agonist glycolipid that can activate NKT cells. However, a primary role for iGb3 in NKT cell selection seems unlikely because iGb3-synthase knockout mice (that are unable to synthesise iGb3) have no defect in NKT cell development [40], and humans do not express functional iGb3 synthase and also appear to lack iGb3 [40­42]. It is possible that NKT cells are selected by a range of ligands, so that eliminating only one of these may have little impact on NKT cell development. Furthermore, NKT cells might be selected by non-agonist ligands, much like conventional T cells are positively selected by non-agonist peptides presented by MHC [27]. Identification of self-glycolipid ligands that drive NKT cell selection, and possibly self-recognition, remains a major goal for immunologists because this may hold the key for why NKT cell numbers vary so widely in humans, and how they might be manipulated. Furthermore, mammalian NKT cell ligands are also likely to be important in NKT cell responses associated with tumor immunity and autoimmune diseases. Far less is known about the development of other nonconventional T cell lineages, mainly due to the more diverse TCR repertoire employed by some of these and/or a lack of specific reagents to identify and track these cells. However, the model derived from our knowledge of NKT cell development should serve as a basis for understanding of the generation of these other cell types. For example, MR1-restricted T cells (mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells) also develop in the thymus where they require expression of their endogenous ligand, MR1, by hemopoietic rather than thymic epithelial cells [43]. Like NKT cells, these cells also express a very limited TCR repertoire, consisting of an invariant TCR- chain (V 19-J 33, combined with V 8 or V 6 in mice; or the homologous human V 7.2-J 33 combined with V 13 or V 2) [44] suggesting a hard-wiring of specificity despite dependence on random TCR gene rearrangement.

While the developmental pathway of CD1a-, b-, c-restricted T cells remains to be explored, and they do not seem to carry a highly restricted TCR repertoire, it is still not unreasonable to propose that these cells also arise through random TCR gene rearrangement events that result in their selection from a common precursor pool in the thymus, and that this TCR-dependent selection event programs the fate of these cells. CD1a, b and c are expressed by thymocytes [45], and when a positive selection signal (even when the ligand is a classical MHC molecule) is derived from thymocytes, rather than from thymic epithelial cells, the selected lymphocytes adopt a non-conventional NKT cell-like phenotype [46,47]. 4. Type 1 NKT TCR composition and structure 4.1. Unliganded iNKT TCRs NKT The structure of three unliganded human V 24+, V TCRs, and two V 24- , V 11+ , NKT TCRs, provided the first structural insights into the basis for selection of the semi-invariant TCR sequences [48,49]. The structure of these TCRs generally resembles that of other TCRs with the V domains comprising three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) each to form the ligand-binding site from the six CDR loops. Notably, the CDR3 loops of all the NKT TCRs adopted slightly different conformations and possessed variable loop lengths, suggesting tantalising evidence for modulation of fine specificity by this variable region of the TCR. The marked species conservation of the CDR3 , CDR1 and CDR2 loops creates a contiguous species `hot-spot' in the NKT TCR predicted from the unliganded TCR to play a crucial role in ligand binding. Interestingly, the KD for binding of NKT TCRs to CD1d- GalCer appears to be of higher affinity (approximately 0.3­1 M) [48­51] than observed for TCRs interacting with pMHC complexes (1­50 M) [52]. 5. A structural basis for the NKT TCR-CD1d- -GalCer interaction Modelling of the NKT-CD1d- -GalCer interface was initially attempted based on unliganded TCR and CD1d structures [48,49], but a somewhat different picture of the binding was realised once the ternary structures were determined. The liganded structures of a human V 24/V 11 NKT TCR [50], a mouse V 14/V 8.2 and a mouse V 14/V 7 NKT TCR bound to CD1d- -GalCer [51] were broadly similar, thus highlighting the conserved nature of the TCR interactions despite differential V usage by these TCRs. The structures unexpectedly revealed some marked differences from conventional TCR binding of peptide/MHC. Firstly, the NKT TCRs adopted an unusual docking mode, positioned over the F pocket of the CD1d-Ag-binding cleft, spanning residues 76­89 and 147­151 of the 1-helix and the 2-helix respectively (Fig. 3). Secondly, the NKT TCR bound approximately parallel to the long axis of the CD1d antigen-binding cleft, rather than the oft quoted "diagonal" footprint adopted by MHC class I-restricted TCRs (Fig. 3). Thirdly, there were no equivalent `generic' contact sites in the CD1d-restricted TCR interaction analogous to the MHC-I positions (65, 69 and 155) thought to be conserved-docking points underscoring MHCrestriction [52,53]. In the human ternary complex, the NKT TCR- chain makes nearly twice as many interactions as the TCR- chain [50,51]. Notably, the CDR1 and CDR3 loops play very little role in any of the liganded structures. Instead, the V 11 chain usage in humans, and V 8.2 and V 7 usage in mice, was largely dictated by the CDR2 loop that binds a stretch of the CD1d 1-helix (residues 83­89) [50,51]. Not surprisingly, the mouse­human NKT TCR-CD1d 11+ ,

cross-reactivity is based on marked sequence similarity in these loops and their flanking regions in the mouse V 8.2 and human V 11 [50]. Rat NKT cells on the other hand, have a divergent CDR2 sequence [54] and only function with syngeneic CD1d as a presenting element. The CDR3 contacts comprise about half the buried surface area of the TCR and involve only the J 18-region through interactions with the CD1d 1-helix, the 2-helix and -GalCer [50,51]. These observations explain the lack of NKT cells in TCR J 18 knockout mice [55] and the preservation of this segment in non-V 24 human NKT cells [49]. In contrast, the CDR1 loop interacts solely with the -GalCer, which only protrudes minimally from the CD1d cleft. Mutagenesis of key TCR and CD1d residues confirms the importance of these conserved interactions underpinning the selection of canonical NKT TCRs [51,56­58].

6. The contribution of the TCRspecificity

chain diversity to antigen

Despite the broadly conserved docking of the NKT TCR in the three ternary structures solved to date [50,51], subtle variations in NKT recognition exist within and across species. For instance, there was more involvement of the mouse V 7-chain interacting with mCD1d than the V 8.2-chain, including the CDR1 loop of V 7 mediating contacts with CD1d [51]. Parri passu with this difference, the CDR2 of V 8.2 made more energetically important interactions with CD1d than the corresponding loop of V 7, consistent with the difference in affinity of these TCRs for CD1d- -GalCer [51]. Furthermore, mutagenesis analysis of the mouse V 7+ NKT TCR revealed that at least one residue in the CDR2 loop (Ser54) adversely affected binding, as the Ser54Ala mutation resulted in approximately a four-fold increase in affinity, similar to the V 8.2+ TCR [51,56]. The glycosyl head group of -GalCer is located below the CDR1 loop and abutting the CDR3 loop adjacent to Trp 153 of human CD1d. Species polymorphism in this residue (Gly 155 in mouse) shifts the glycosyl head group of -GalCer by 3Å between the mouse and human structures [59]. Moreover, the glycosyl head group also moves upon TCR ligation collectively suggesting how Ag flexibility could be influential in CDR3 -interactions. The basis for the exquisite fine specificity of NKT TCRs for GalCer and some of its structurally related analogs resides in the H-bonds made by the invariant TCR -chain and the 2 , 3 and 4 hydroxyl groups of the galactose ring [51,60]. However, the mechanism by which the relatively limited NKT TCR repertoire discriminate between different more diverse glycolipids, such as iGb3, both structurally and functionally, remains unresolved. The temperature independence of the binding affinity of mouse NKT TCRs with CD1d- -GalCer, and the lack of ligand-induced conformational changes in the NKT TCR, suggest a rigid `lock and key' mode of binding. Indeed ­ the seemingly conserved nature of NKT TCR docking to a range of glycolipid antigens has prompted it being likened to a pattern recognition receptor [57]. However, plasticity in the variable CDR3 loops, as well as V chain diversity, might allow adjustments that are crucial to binding of certain glycolipids. In addition, more complex glycosyl head groups like that of iGb3 [61] might occupy the cavity identified in all NKT TCR structures described so far [48,49]. While complex structures have been solved for NKT TCRs using the major TCR V chains (hV 11, mV 8.2 and mV 7), it is unknown whether other (rarer) V chains, such as the V 2+ NKT TCR and others found in mice and humans, also bind in a similar way. That mouse V 2 lacks both of the key contact residues (Tyr 48 and Tyr 50) that are responsible for V 8.2 binding makes it harder to speculate on how the V 2+ TCR will bind. However, TCR mutagenesis studies of V 2+ NKT TCRs have revealed similar key contact residues in the TCR chain, which suggests that the TCR

The terminal sugar of iGb3 is not shown as it is mobile and unresolved in the crystal structure.

still adopts a similar docking mode, regardless of the TCR chain ­ but these studies also suggested that the CDR1 loop played a role at the interface [56,57]. Regardless of whether the docking mode is conserved, CDR3 diversity can clearly contribute to recognition. It is already established that some CDR3 sequences are not permissive for CD1d- -GalCer binding [48], and CDR3 mutagenesis studies demonstrate that this region can positively and negatively influence NKT TCR binding, particularly for antigens other than GalCer and particularly for TCRs using the minor V chains V 7 and V 2 [56,57]. Furthermore, CDR3 sequencing of the V 6+ NKT cells in mice revealed a specific motif that appears to be necessary

for binding of V 6+ NKT TCRs [56]. Thus, TCR- chain diversity, including CDR3 diversity, seems to provide subsets of NKT cells with flexibility in antigen recognition, and may therefore endow NKT cell subsets with a degree of antigen specificity. In support of this, the V 7+ NKT cell fraction has been shown to bind more avidly to iGb3, while in contrast, the V 8.2+ NKT cell fraction binds more avidly to -GalCer [62,63]. However, a more recent study challenged this, providing data that was more consistent with a hierarchy of affinities where V 8.2 was generally higher than V 7, which was generally higher than V 2, regardless of the glycolipid antigen in question [56].

7. The role of the TCR- chain in recognition of diverse antigens presented by CD1d As described above, the family of lipid-based antigens that are recognised by NKT TCRs continues to grow. In some cases, only a small percentage of NKT appear to recognise these Ag as exemplified by GD3-specific NKT cells that are virtually undetectable in unmanipulated mice, but clearly identifiable as a discrete population following immunisation with GD3 [20]. In other cases many, but not all, NKT cells seem to recognise the antigen (e.g. iGb3, -GalDAG, -glycuronosylceramide [13,16,17]). In these situations, the most likely candidate in distinguishing NKT cells that react from those that do not is the TCR- chain. Nonetheless, for some of these antigens, such as iGb3 that is structurally dissimilar to -GalCer, it is difficult to imagine how they would be incorporated into the existing NKT TCR-CD1d structural complexes that have been solved using -GalCer as the antigen. Based upon TCR mutagenesis studies [57], the same key TCR- chain residues are involved in binding, regardless of whether the antigen is -GalCer or iGb3, suggesting the TCR docks in roughly the same mode for both antigens, although many more TCR- chain residues were involved in iGb3 recognition. Considering this, it seems unlikely that iGb3 can be incorporated into the antigenbinding groove because of steric inhibition due to clashes with the larger triglycosyl head group of iGb3 and the NKT TCR- chain. An alternate proposal is that iGb3, and possibly other larger antigens, are squashed flat by the TCR [50,61] as observed in some TCR-pMHC interactions [64,65]. While this hypothesis might solve the problem of steric hindrance, it is complicated by the fact that the terminal sugar linkage ( 1­3 galactose) of iGb3 is a critical factor in its antigenicity because (globotrihexosylceramide (Gb3)), which varies only in the terminal sugar linkage ( 1­4 galactose), is not an agonist. Furthermore, lactosylceramide, which is the same as iGb3 minus the terminal Gal sugar, is also not an agonist. These points indicate that, even if the glycosyl head group of iGb3 is pushed flat, the terminal sugar plays a key role in TCR binding. 8. Summary/future directions Based on evidence to date, it seems that the NKT TCR-CD1d interaction is primarily governed by the TCR- chain, and that the TCRchain modulates binding affinity and possibly antigen specificity. Key questions are whether all NKT TCRs, including those that utilise under-represented V chains, adopt a similar docking mode to those already solved. Similarly, antigen recognition by other CD1drestricted T cells (Type 2 NKT cells), group 1 CD1 (a, b, c) restricted T cells, and semi-invariant MAIT cells remains to be explored. The fact that Type 2 NKT cells and MAIT cells also express invariant TCRchains might suggest that these TCRs also bind to their ligands in a predetermined manner, where TCR- chains contribute to fine specificity. The conserved nature of these semi-invariant TCRs and their non-polymorphic ligands suggests that these may be used to produce multimeric TCR reagents to probe normal or tumor tissue for CD1 or MR1-restricted antigens. The structural data will also assist with the design of improved agonist or antagonist ligands for immunotherapeutic targeting of these non-conventional, and functionally potent, T cells.
