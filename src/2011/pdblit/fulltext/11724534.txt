Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate (OAA) to PEP and carbon dioxide with the ° subsequent conversion of nucleoside triphosphate to nucleoside diphosphate (NDP). The 1.9 A resolution structure of Escherichia coli PCK consisted of a 275-residue N-terminal domain and a 265-residue C-terminal domain with the active site located in a cleft between these domains. Each domain has an a/h topology and the overall structure represents a new protein fold. Furthermore, PCK has a unique ° mononucleotide-binding fold. The 1.8 A resolution structure of the complex of ATP/Mg2+/oxalate with PCK revealed a 20j hinge-like rotation of the N- and C-terminal domains, which closed the active site cleft. The ATP was found in the unusual syn conformation as a result of binding to the enzyme. Along with the side chain of Lys254, Mg2+ neutralizes charges on the Ph and Pg oxygen atoms of ATP and stabilizes an extended, eclipsed conformation of the Ph and Pg phosphoryl groups. The sterically strained high-energy conformation likely lowers the free energy of activation for phosphoryl transfer. Additionally, the g-phosphoryl group becomes oriented in-line with the appropriate enolate oxygen atom, which strongly supports a direct SN2-type displacement of this g-phosphoryl group by the enolate anion. In ° the 2.0 A resolution structure of the complex of PCK/ADP/Mg2+/AlF3, the AlF3 moiety represents the phosphoryl group being transferred during catalysis. There are three positively charged groups that interact with the fluorine atoms, which are complementary to the three negative charges that would occur for an associative transition state.

1. Introduction 1.1. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP-oxaloacetate carboxylyase (transphosphorylating), EC 4.1.1.49, or, for the guanosine 5Vtriphosphate (GTP)-dependent enzyme, EC 4.1.1.32) catalyzes the decarboxylation and mononucleoside

triphosphate (NTP)-dependent phosphorylation of oxaloacetate (OAA) to form PEP and nucleoside diphosphate (NDP). The enzyme is abbreviated herein as PCK, and is also widely known as PEPCK: OAA þ NTPfPEP þ NDP þ CO2 This is the first committed step of gluconeogenesis in all organisms and is reversible. A divalent metal cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, is also required for catalysis. Both metal ions are required for optimal catalysis [1­ 3]. In Escherichia coli, PCK is utilized when sugar levels are low [1]. E. coli causes >90% of urinary tract infections developed outside of hospitals [4]. Glucose limits E. coli growth in urine [5] and PCK activity is believed necessary for this bacterial infection. In humans and other mammals, PCK is a central enzyme in carbohydrate metabolism. In mammals, PCK helps regulate blood glucose levels. Non-insulin-dependent diabetes

mellitus (NIDDM), also known as Type 2 diabetes, is a complex disease characterized mainly by insulin resistance and impaired pancreatic h-cell function/insulin secretion [6,7]. Increased gluconeogenesis is responsible for NIDDM patients' high blood glucose level after an overnight fast [8,9]. Transgenic mice overexpressing PCK showed unsuppressed liver glucose production and developed NIDDM; PCK has therefore been suggested as a potential drug target in the treatment of this disease [10]. PCKs are classified according to nucleotide specificity, with adenosine 5V -triphosphate (ATP)-dependent enzymes present in most bacteria, yeast, Trypanomastid parasites, and plants, with the GTP-dependent PCKs present in a variety of other eukaryotes (including mammals) [11] and in some bacteria [12]. Enzymes within their respective ATP- or GTP-dependent groups share 40­ 80% amino acid sequence identity, but there is no detectable sequence homology between the two enzyme classes. However, it has been demonstrated [13,14] that both ATP- and GTP-dependent enzymes have similar OAA- and phosphoryl-binding active site sequence consensus motifs which likely have similar functions. Many phospho-transfer enzymes selectively utilize magnesium and manganese in NTP binding and catalysis [15], and PCKs from all sources are among these enzymes. Kinetically, both ATP- and GTP-dependent PCKs illustrate that a combination of Mg2+ and Mn2+ induce a synergistic effect on enzyme activity [1,2,16]. Optimal activity of chicken liver mitochondrial PCK [2] and E. coli PCK [1] was obtained in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ and micromolar concentrations of Mn2+. These are the approximate concentrations of ions present in vivo [17]. Kinetic and spectroscopic studies on chicken liver mitochondrial PCK [18] suggest that Mg2+ and Mn2+ are preferentially partitioned between two proximal sites, with Mg2+ forming the metal ­ nucleotide complex and Mn2+ binding to the active site of the enzyme. 1.2. Associative and dissociative phosphoryl transfer A controversy exists as to whether enzyme-catalyzed phosphoryl-transfer reactions operate primarily with an associative (SN2-type) or dissociative (SN1-type) transition state. These two possibilities are illustrated in Fig. 1. Phosphoryl transfer by small molecules [19,20] and model studies on p21Ha-ras [21] have produced reasoning in favor of a dissociative mechanism of catalysis in kinases and phosphatases. Conversely, arguments have also been made in favor of these enzymes operating with more of an associative character [22,23]. Positional isotope exchange experiments on creatine kinase [24] and pyruvate kinase [25] indicate that an associative transition state occurs, whereas both kinetic studies on NDP kinase [26] and secondary 18O isotope experiments with hexokinase [27], indicate a dissociative transition state. Many arguments in favor of associative or dissociative transition states for

phosphoryl transfer by kinases have been based on the geometry and reaction coordinate distances between the terminal phosphoryl group and its acceptor substrate in ground state enzyme ­ substrate/inhibitor complexes. For the transition state to have some degree of associative character, these distances should be smaller than the sum of a P ­ O van der Waals' contact and a P ­O single bond ° (approximately 4.9 A), while in a dissociative mechanism, the distances should be longer than this [23,28]. In order to distinguish between associative and dissociative transition states in a structural way, it is ideal to have a picture of the transition state complex. Since the transition state is very short-lived ( f 10À 13 s), structural analogs of the transferred g-phosphoryl group are used. The trigonal planar AlF3 represents the transition state structure, whereas À the tetrahedral BeF2 or BeF3 represent the ground state structure [29]. Crystal structures of complexes of different enzymes with these analogs have been reported. UMP/CMP kinase with substrates and either AlF3 or BeF2 [30] indicate that the side chains of positively charged arginine residues rearrange during catalysis to stabilize negative charges on the transferred phosphoryl group; this is consistent with the three negative charges that would occur for this species in the associative mechanism (Fig. 1). The distances of the Al

atom from the bridging oxygen atom of adenosine 5V ° diphosphate (ADP) is 2.0 A, and from the relevant oxygen ° atom of CMP is 2.2 A, which suggests a significant amount of bond formation in the transition state. In contrast, a similar study of NDP kinase complexes with Mg2+/ADP, À and either AlF3, or BeF3 , suggested a situation intermediate between associative and dissociative transition states [31]; nevertheless, two positively charged side chains and the Mg2+ ion also appear to be poised to stabilize negative charges on the transferred phosphoryl group. Another important structure of an enzyme complex solved was that of the human H-Ras bound to the GTPase-activating protein p120GAP (GAP-334), as well as to Mg2+/ADP, and AlF3 [32]. In this latter structure, two positively charged side chains (one from GAP-334) and the Mg2+ cation also seem to stabilize negative charges on the transferred phosphoryl ° group; the 2.2 A distances between the Al atom and the bridging oxygen atom of GDP, and between the Al atom and the catalytic water molecule, are mainly consistent with an associative transition state. AlF3 has been used to mimic the transition state in the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; the bond distances, the trigonal bipyramidal coordination of the aluminum atom, and the positively charged species imply an associative mechanism for phosphoryl transfer [33]. More recently, nitrate has been used as the analogue in kinases for the transferred phosphoryl group [34 ­ 36]. Based on the results with nitrate [34], a dissociative mechanism has been proposed for Phospho-CDK2/ Cyclin A catalysis.

2. Crystallographic procedures Crystals were grown of the substrate-free E. coli PCK [37] from 10 mg mlÀ 1 PCK, 0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), 50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM Tris ­ HCl, and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, pH 5.4. The ° space group is P212121 with a = 77.7, b = 89.7, c = 93.8 A. After considerable effort, the native enzyme's crystal struc° ture was solved at 1.9 A resolution by a combination of multiple isomorphous replacement and electron density modification methods [38]. This represents one of the first times that the Phase Refinement by Iterative Skeleton Modification (PRISM) [39] technique was employed to help solve a protein crystal structure. When substrate-free crystals of PCK are transferred to solutions of mother liquor and 2 mM ATP and 5 mM MgCl2, were added, the crystals dissolved. Attempts to cocrystallize PCK with Mg2+/ATP under related conditions that produced the native PCK crystals were unsuccessful. Finally, after screening several different crystallization conditions, crystals of the complex of PCK with Mg2+/ ATP/oxalate were grown from 8 mg mlÀ 1 PCK, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM oxalate, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium acetate, 200 mM ammonium acetate and 27% (w/v) PEG 4000, pH 4.4. The space group is C2 with

° ° a = 127.5, b = 96.7, c = 47.0 A and b = 96.6j. Data to 1.8 A resolution were collected at the Photon Factory beam-line BL16B in Tsukuba, Japan. Using the native PCK as a starting model and the X-PLOR program suite [40], the structure was solved by use of the molecular replacement method [41]. The complex of PCK with AlF3, Mg2+, and ADP was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion from 10 Al drops containing 6 mg mlÀ 1 PCK, 2 mM ADP, 0.8 mM Al((NO)3)3, 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM NaF, 0.1 mM EDTA, 200 mM ammonium acetate, 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.8), 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 30% (w/v) PEG 4000. Crystals of the complex of PCK with AlF3, Mg2+, ADP, and pyruvate were grown under the same conditions with the addition of 20 mM pyruvate. Data ° were collected to 2.0 A resolution on a crystal of the first complex on beam-line BL18B at the Photon Factory. Data ° on a crystal of the second complex were collected to 2.0 A resolution on beam-line 14-BM-D at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories. The crystals of these complexes are isomorphous with that of the PCK/ Mg2+/ATP/oxalate complex and the structures were solved by molecular replacement [42]. The complex of PCK with ATP/Mg2+/Mn2+/pyruvate was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion from 10 Al drops containing 10 mg mlÀ 1 PCK, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM PEP, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.4), 200 mM ammonium acetate, ° 27% (w/v) PEG 4000. Data were collected to 1.9 A resolution with the use of an Enraf ­ Nonius FAST Area Detector equipped with a FR-571 copper rotating anode generator. The complex of PCK with ATP/Mg2+/Ca2+/ pyruvate was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion from 10 Al drops containing 10 mg mlÀ 1 PCK, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM PEP, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.4), 200 mM ammonium acetate, 24% (w/v) PEG 4000. Data were ° collected to 1.8 A resolution on a crystal of the second complex on beam-line BL18B at the Photon Factory. Crystals of these complexes are isomorphous with that of the PCK/Mg2+/ATP/oxalate complex and the structures were solved by molecular replacement [14,43].

3. Structural features 3.1. Tertiary structure The E. coli PCK tertiary structure has a unique protein fold and is an open-faced, mixed a/h structure that consists of two domains, a 275-residue N-terminal domain and a 265-residue C-terminal mononucleotide-binding domain. In the ligand-free structure, the two domains ° are separated by a deep cleft of 25 A, which contains the active site [38]. Consistent with dissolving the native PCK crystals upon addition of Mg2+/ATP, there is a major

conformational change in PCK as a result of the binding of Mg2+/ATP. The complex's C-terminal domain rotated by 20j in a hinge-like fashion relative to the N-terminal domain, thereby closing the active site cleft [41]. 3.2. Substrate/inhibitor binding Oxalate is a structural analogue of the enolate of pyruvate, which acts as a competitive inhibitor of PCK in the direction of PEP formation. The side chains of three basic residues, Arg65, Lys213, and Arg333, as well as the side chain of Tyr207, bind the oxalate anion in a positively charged pocket. Oxalate is completely buried at the bottom of the active site in the complex's structure, whereas ATP is oriented with the triphosphoryl group also buried, but with the adenine N7 ­ N9 and the ribose C1V C2V O2V exposed ­ ­ to solvent. ATP is bound to PCK in a syn conformation with the bulky portion of the adenine base situated over the ribose ring (Fig. 2). The side chains of amino acid residues His232 and Arg333, as well as amino acid residues of the P-loop (main chain NHs of Gly251, Gly253 and Thr255; side chains of Ser250 and Lys254), hydrogen bond to the triphosphate group of ATP. The magnesium cation is coordinated to an oxygen atom on each of the h- and g-phosphoryl groups on ATP, as well as to the hydroxyl group of Thr255. The octahedral coordination is completed by three water molecules, two of which are hydrogen bonded to the side chain carboxylates of Asp268 and Asp269, and the other water molecule is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom on Pa

(Fig. 2). This is the situation for all of the complexes that contain ATP. The structures of complexes of PCK with AlF3, Mg2+, and ADP, and of PCK with AlF3, Mg2+, ADP, and pyruvate have been determined [42]. The Al atom has trigonal bipyramidal geometry that mimics the transition state of phosphoryl transfer. Additionally, there are three positively charged species around the AlF3 moiety, which indicate that phosphoryl transfer in PCK occurs via a direct displacement mechanism with associative qualities. 3.3. Structures of the complexes of E. coli PCK with Mg2+/ ATP/Mn2+/pyruvate and E. coli PCK with Mg2+/ATP/Ca2+/ pyruvate Under the crystallization conditions the ADP and PEP reacted to form ATP and pyruvate in crystals of both of these complexes. The structures are isomorphous with the crystal structure of the complex of PCK with Mg2+/ATP/ oxalate [41]. Coordination of the Mg2+ cation in both complexes is identical to that existing in the complex of PCK with Mg2+/ATP/oxalate. In the first complex the coordination of the Mn2+ cation is octahedral [14]. The side chain of His232 coordinates Mn2+. One oxygen atom of the g-phosphoryl group, one oxygen atom of the side chain of Asp269, and two water molecules also coordinate the Mn2+ cation. The side chain of Lys213 forms the sixth and final coordination site to Mn2 +. In the structure of the Ca2+-containing complex (Fig. 3), the seven ligands of Ca2+ consist of one oxygen atom of pyruvate, the Nq2 of His232, two oxygen atoms of the side chain of Asp269, one oxygen atom from the g-phosphoryl group of ATP, the N~ from Lys213 and one ordered water molecule. The Ca2+ cation is directly coordinated to the pyruvate in this complex [43] (unlike the Mn2+ complex where the Mn2+ cation is coordinated by a water molecule that is hydrogen bonded to an oxygen atom of pyruvate).

evolutionarily related to PCK [53,54] and is also a member of this new family of phosphotransferases [55,56]. Manganese or calcium act as a bridge between the enolate of pyruvate and ATP, as well as activators of both substrates. Kinetic studies with the GTP-dependent chicken liver mitochondrial PCK [2] and with rat liver cytosolic PCK [3] agree with this observation. By binding one of the terminal oxygen atoms of the Pg atom of ATP in its inner coordination sphere, Mn2+ or Ca2+ enhance the electrophilicity of Pg by directly polarizing an additional P­ O bond. The Ca2+ would neutralize electrostatic repulsions between the enolate of pyruvate and the g-phosphoryl group, and would bring the two substrates together while orienting the enolate oxygen atom so that it is poised to attack and displace the g-phosphoryl group from ATP. This second bound active site metal (Mn2+ or Ca2+) appears to be important for synergistic activation of the enzyme to produce optimal activity.

5. Mechanism of catalysis The proposed mechanism of catalysis for PCK is illustrated in Fig. 4. The OAA binds in the coordination sphere of Ca2+ and this promotes decarboxylation to form the enolate of pyruvate. The Ca2+ cation stabilizes the pyruvate enolate anion and is also coordinated by one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms of pyruvate; the side chain of Arg65 forms a hydrogen bond with the other carboxylate oxygen atom of pyruvate. Ca2+ neutralizes electrostatic repulsion between the enolate of pyruvate and the g-phosphate of ATP, moving the two substrates together and orienting the enolate oxygen atom to nucleophilically attack and to displace the g-phosphoryl group. Both the side chain of Lys254 and the Mg2+ cation neutralize the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged hand g-phosphate oxygen atoms of ATP and stabilize an extended form of the triphosphate chain with eclipsed hand g-phosphoryl groups, forming a sterically strained, high-energy transition state. The Mg2+ also polarizes a P ­ O bond of the g-phosphoryl group and renders Pg electrophilic, increasing the probability of nucleophilic attack by the enolate of pyruvate to acquire the phosphoryl group to form PEP and also produce ADP.

4. Discussion A phosphoryl-binding loop or P-loop resides within the nucleotide-binding region, which is common to many ATPand GTP-binding proteins [44]. This P-loop is homologous to that in adenylate kinase [45], p21Ha-ras [46], RecA protein [47], and bacterial HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) [48]. However, unlike the classical mononucleotide-binding fold described by Schulz [49], the P-loop is present in a novel nucleotide-binding fold. PCK represents a new structural family under the Structural Classification of Proteins scheme [50]. As expected, the ATP-dependent Trypanosoma cruzi PCK structure [51] showed these features. The GTP-dependent human PCK structure [52] also confirmed the novel features of E. coli PCK. The bacterial HPrK/P illustrated a similar active site for phosphotransfer and seems to be

6. Conclusions and perspectives PCK is a phosphoryl-transfer enzyme that has an unusual nucleotide-binding fold and a new protein fold. The transferred g-phosphoryl group of ATP seems to be stabilized by three positively charged groups, indicating an associative nature to the phosphotransfer by this enzyme. The enzyme HPrK/P has an identical nucleotide-binding fold and an identical active site for phosphoryl-transfer as does PCK. Thus, it is very likely that

phosphotransfer by HPrK/P will also be shown to have some associative qualities.
