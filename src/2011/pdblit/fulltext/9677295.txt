INTRODUCTION

In a previous paper we showed that unilateral pyelonephritis in cats could be produced by intravenous injection of Escherichia coli in the presence of temporary obstruction to one ureter (Kelly, Lucke and McCullagh, 1979). In
some cats the early inflammatory lesions progressed to patchy scarring, with paper

persistent focal pyelonephritis characterized by interstitial fibrosis, lymphocytic
accumulation, tubular degeneration and glomerular sclerosis. This describes the ultrastructural appearances of these chronic renal changes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Experimental renal disease was produced in young adult cats by i.v. injection of E. coli, in the presence of temporary (24 or 48 h) obstruction of one ureter (Kelly et al., 1979). Significant renal lesions developed only in the obstructed kidney. Samples of renal cortex were obtained from the affected kidneys of 7 cats at 1, 2, 3 and 14 months after infection with a human strain of E. coli and of 3 cats at 3, 4 and 5 months after infection with a feline strain of E. coli. Control material consisted of the non-affected kidney from these cats and normal kidneys from young specificpathogen-free cats that had been used in non-infectious disease experiments on feline urolithiasis (C. J. Gaskell, personal communication). General anaesthesia was first induced by i.v. injection of sodium pentobarbitone so1ution.t The kidney capsule was incised and reflected and the whole cortex examined for the presence of gross lesions. Small wedges of superficial scarred and apparently normal renal cortex were excised with a scalpel and immersed in chilled glutaraldehyde-paraldehyde fixative (Karnovsky, 1965). The tissue was trimmed into cubes of not more than 1 mm3 and fixation was continued at room temperature for 4 h or overnight. After washing in tap water the cubes were further fixed in 1 per cent osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated in ascending grades of alcohol and embedded in epoxy resin. Thick plastic sections (1 pm) were cut and stained with hot toluidine blue in 1 per cent borax and examined to identify normal, inflamed and scarred areas for further study. Thin sections (60 nm,) were cut with a diamond knife, double-stained with alcoholic uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Philips 201 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV.
RESULTS

The patchy distribution of pyelonephritis lesions (Kelly et al., 1979) allowed examination of both scarred and non-scarred areas of renal cortex. In the latter

intracytoplasmic lipid and angulated mitochondria (Fig. 6), implying a derivation from tubular epithelium. The earliest abnormality noted in the glomerular tuft was segmental sclerosis. This appeared ultrastructurally as segmental thickening and wrinkling of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) (Fig. 7). Advanced sclerosis cf the glomerular tuft was recognized by loss of glomerular space, capillary obliteration and reduction in cellularity (Fig. 2). Electron microscopic examination of these sclerotic glomeruli showed irregular Folding and thickening of GBM, thickening of capsular BM, periglomerular fibroblastic proliferation and appearance of` many collagen fibrils (Fig. 8).

The most striking change was thickening of tubular basement membrane (`TBM). This was readily appreciated in thick plastic sections (Fig. 9) ; individual tubules were sometimes affected, while in other areas many tubules were

Fibroblast cytoplasm sometimes extended into the thickcaned TBM which also included cytoplasmic granules and vesicular material (Figs 10, 11). Two patterns of TBM thickening were recognized: (a) irregular and t&al, producing distinct "scalloping" of the outer aspect of the membrane !Fig. lo), (b) d i ff use and relatively uniform, involving the complete circumference of the tubule. In both cases irregular rarefaction and vesiculation of thta basement membrane also was seen.

was a loss of microvilli and of definition of cell outlines and an increase in the number of cytoplasmic lysosomes and phagosomes. Myelin figures were also present in some atrophic epithelial cells. Interstitium In normal feline kidneys (Fig. 1) or in the non-scarred regions of kidney from cats with pyelonephritis, the tubules were closely apposed and the intervening interstitium contained capillaries, occasional fibroblasts and small amounts of collagen (Fig. 12). In pyelonephritic areas there was often extensive interstitial fibrosis with an increase in the number of both fibroblasts and collagen fibrils.

In addition to interstitial fibroblasts there was a patchy accumulation of mononuclear cells (Fig. 16). A few of these were lymphocytes, but most of the larger angulated cells were plasma cells with abundant cytoplasm and extensive dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum containing faintly granular material

Electron microscopic examination showed that fibroblasts and plasma cells were applied to the periphery of the lipid droplets /`Figs 11, 19). Macrophages were not conspicuous in the vicinity of the interstitial lipid and only occasional polymorphonuclear leukocytes were seen in the interstitium.

DISCUSSION

There is relatively little information on the ultrastructural changes in experimental chronic pyelonephritis, most studies having concentrated on the earlier stages of active infection and inflammation (Dublin and Shimamura, 1975; Fry, Fried and Goven, 1975; Johnston and Latta, 1973, 1978). Our electron microscopic examination of the renal cortex from cats with chronic experimental pyelonephritis has revealed a variety of lesions affecting glomeruli, tubules and interstitium. The commonest glomerular change was segmental and focal tuft sclerosis, involving both mesangium and GBM. The changes in severely sclerotic glomeruli were similar to those seen in obsolescent glomeruli in human chronic glomerulonephritis (Zollinger and Mihatsch, 1978). Wrinkling and collapse of GBM are common to both feline and human glomerular obsolescence; in man they are said to result from impaired blood flow, caused by destruction and compression of the postglomerular interstitial capillary network. Intraglomerular collagen fibrosis, as described in man (Zollinger and Mihatsch, 1978), was not seen in the cats in this study: this may reflect the relatively short duration of the feline disease. Thickening and fragmentation of the basement membrane of Bowman's capsule, with periglomerular fibrosis, are features common to both feline and human pyelonephritis. The appearance of occasional "clear" cells in proliferating capsular epithelium has also been described in human chronic pyelonephritis (Zollinger and Mihatsch, 1978). Our EM examination suggests that in the feline disease these "clear" cells are undergoing degeneration (Figs 4, 8). Changes affecting the renal tubules consisted of epithelial cell atrophy and alterations in the TBM. The cellular changes were similar to those described in other atrophic cells (Trump and Arstila, 1971, 1975), but one aspect is of special interest. The degenerating epithelial cells frequently accumulated amounts of cytoplasmic lipid greater than those found normally in the proximal renal tubule of the cat. Both the number and size of the lipid droplets increased so that individual atrophic cells sometimes appeared to have their cytoplasm almost completely occupied by large, coalescent droplets (Figs 9, 10, 11). The interstitial tissue in these areas often contained similar large lipid droplets which had presumably been released from degenerating epithelial cells (Figs 9, 11, 18, 19). All these lipid changes have previously been recognized in the kidneys of cats with spontaneous renal disease (Lucke, 1968). It is of interest that in neither spontaneous nor experimental disease in the cat is there any evidence of macrophage reaction to the presence of the interstitial lipid. In none of the tissues examined in this study was there any reaction resembling xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. This type of chronic pyelonephritis occurs in man and is usually associated with suppuration and urinary tract obstruction : large numbers of lipid-laden macrophages are found in the renal interstitium and are believed to occur as a result of interference with renal drainage (Heptinstall, 1974). There is no evidence in man that the fat is derived from renal tubular epithelium, as is thought to occur in cats (Scott and Quigley, 1972). TBM changes included rarefaction, fraying, focal or diffuse thickening,

lamellation and folding. These usually occurred around tubules whose epithehal cells were undergoing atrophy. Basement membrane changes of these kinds are common non-specific ones that occur in association with degenerative atrophy of epithelial cells in many sites and can result from a variety of causes such as X-irradiation, infection and chemically-induced cellular damage (Chatelanat and Simon, 1969; Pierce and Nakane, 1969). They have also been observed in spontaneous renal disease in the cat (Lucke, 1968). TBM changes similar to those of feline pyelonephritis have been described in rats whose kidney tubules were rendered atrophic by renal vein obstruction (Romen and hlader-Kruse, 1978) : there was widening, focal thickening with vesicular and granular inclusions, and circumscribed dissolution or duplication of the hascmerit membrane. These workers argued that whereas normal TBM is prcsumably formed by both tubular epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts, the thickened TBR4 of atrophic tubules must result from the secretory activity of interstitial fibroblasts alone since the tubular epithelium is degenerate. While the ultrastructural examination of atrophic tubules in experimental feline pyclonephritis confirms a close relationship between the thickened TBM and interstitial fibroblasts, it is not at all clear that the excess BM material is derived from this source. Where interstitial fibroblasts were present in large numbers the most conspicuous component of the extracellular matrix was cross-banded fibrils of collagen. Material corresponding to amorphous BM was notably absent from such areas. It is perhaps more likely that tubular epithelial drgeneration interferes in some way with the normal catabolism and turnover 01 `TBkl, and so leads to abnormal accumulation at the base of the cell undergoing atrophy. Our recent studies on the extractable collagen of normal and pyelonephritic feline kidneys provide evidence for a relative decrease in BXI collagen components, rather than an increase, in the diseased state (McCullagh, Luckc, Bishop and Kelly, 1979). This finding suggests that caution should be exercised in the interpretation of morphological TBR4 thickening until more is known 01 the kinetics of'its formation and turnover. The presence of multiple bundles of myofibrils and dense bodies in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts in scarred areas of interstitium gives these cells a superficial resemblance to smooth muscle cells (Fig. 13). Cells intermediate in differentiation between fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells are frequently seen in granulation tissue and have been given the name "myofibroblasts" (Gabbiani, Hirschel, Ryan, Statkov and Majno, 1972). Such cells may arise from the migration and proliferation of interstitial vascular smooth muscle cells in response to injury, or they may differentiate from resting interstitial fibroblasts. In either case the presence of a prominent contractile apparatus suggests au ability for rapid migration into and through the scarred zone. Ultrastructural examination of the non-fibroblastic interstitial cells confirms the interpretation of light microscopy that the predominant reaction consists of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Although this aspect of the lesion was not specifically studied it is likely that this cellular reaction is an immunological response, both to the infecting organisms initiating the renal lesions and to antigens reIeased from damaged tubular epithelial ceiIs.

SUMMARY

An ultrastructural study was made of the renal cortical lesions in cats with pyelonephritis produced by experimental Escherichia coli infection and temporary renal obstruction. The most striking changes were interstitial fibrosis, thickening and folding of the tubular basement membrane, and atrophy of renal tubular epithelium. Interstitial inflammatory cells were mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells. Release of renal tubular lipid into the interstitium occurred commonly but did not appear to provoke additional cellular response. Glomerular changes included segmental sclerosis, wrinkling and collapse of basement membrane, thickening and fragmentation of Bowman's capsule, and periglomerular fibrosis. The changes described are similar to those which occur in a variety of human and animal nephropathies and represent nonspecific responses to injury.
