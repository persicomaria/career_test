We previously reported that tumor necrosis factorconverting enzyme (TACE) was specifically inhibited by TIMP-3 but not TIMP-1, -2, and -4. Further mutagenesis studies showed that the N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 (N-TIMP-3) retained full inhibitory activity towards TACE. Full-length TIMP-3 and N-TIMP-3 exhibited indistinguishable values for the association rate constant and inhibitory affinity constant for the active catalytic domain of TACE (k on 10 5 M 1 s 1 and K iapp 0.20 nM). Moreover, their k on ( 10 4 M 1 s 1) and K iapp ( 1.0 nM) values with a longer form of TACE (which encompasses the complete ectodomain including disintegrin, EGF and Crambin-like domains) were also shown to be similar. Detailed kinetic analyses indicated that TIMP-3 associated more quickly and with tighter final binding with TACE devoid of these C-terminal domains. We conclude that, unlike the interaction between many MMPs and TIMPs, the C-terminal domains of TIMP-3 and TACE are not essential in the formation of a tight binary complex.

TNF- -converting enzyme (TACE) is a member of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain, ADAM-17) family of metalloproteinases responsible for the proteolytic cleavage and ectodomain shedding of many cell surface proteins, including proTNF- , interleukin 6-receptor and Notch 1 receptor (1­3). Initially thought to be an exclusively cell surface-anchored transmembrane metalloproteinase, recent immunofluorescence studies indicate that TACE is also localized to a significant level in a perinuclear compartment (4). The crystal structure of the

catalytic domain of TACE resolved at 2.0 Å reveals a polypeptide fold which resembles that of the snake venom/adamalysin MMPs (5). The most prominent feature is the catalytic zinc situated adjacent to an active site cleft formed by the fusion of S1 and S3 specificity pockets below the molecular surface (5). Metalloproteinases from the ADAM family show very restricted specificity with respect to inhibition by the MMP inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). To date, four species of TIMPs have been isolated in mammalian cells, namely TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4, but only TIMP-3 has been demonstrated to be inhibitory towards TACE (6). High resolution NMR and crystal structures of TIMP-1 and -2 were published recently (7­9). The molecules appear to share a similar pattern of topology, i.e., the polypeptide chains fold into two distinct opposing halves of N- and C-domains. The N-terminal domain, consisting of the first twothirds of the molecules, is curled into a compact five-stranded beta-barrel homologous to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) motif otherwise found in many DNA-binding proteins (7­9). This rigidly-packed core motif is held together by three disulfide bonds. The overall wedge-shaped TIMP molecules disrupt the functions of MMPs by slotting its elongated edge into the active site cleft, thus forming a tight proteinase-inhibitor complex (10, 11). Although TACE has not been cocrystallized with any of the TIMPs, it is generally believed that a similar mode of interactions occurs between ADAM and TIMPs (5). The C-terminal domain of the TIMPs constitutes the remaining one-third of the molecule, and consists of three disulfide bonds. This domain lacks distinct organization and its effect on overall TIMP folding has not been fully understood. Some truncated TIMPs without the C-domain exhibited vastly less inhibitory activities against some but not all MMPs (12, 13). By deletion mutagenesis, the C-domain of TIMP-2 was shown to contribute considerably to initial complex formation with the corresponding C-terminus of gelatinase-A (Gel-A) (14).

In spite of the successes in elucidating TIMP-1 and -2 structures in recent years, no crystal or NMR structure of TIMP-3 has been published so far. In this paper, we report that refolded N-TIMP-3 has equal inhibitory activities towards TACE in comparison with full-length TIMP-3 purified from overexpressing mouse myeloma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS Construct of N-TIMP-3 Expression Vector
Human N-TIMP-3 cDNA (encompassing amino acids 1­115) was amplified by PCR with the forward and reverse primers as followed: forwards, 5 TTTTGATCATATGTGCACATGCTCGCCCAGCCACCCCCAG 3 ; reverse, 5 TTTTGGTCGACAGTTACAACCCAGGTGATACCGATAGTT 3 . A methionine codon (ATG) was introduced into the forward primer as the initiating signal for protein translation. NdeI and SalI restriction sites (underlined) were also incorporated in the primers for ease of downstream subcloning. After gel-purification, the PCR product was ligated into EcoRV-cleaved pBluescript vector and positive clones were identified by restriction analysis with NdeI and SalI. The NdeI-SalI fragment was subsequently ligated in frame to a C-terminal myc-histidine tag in pRSET expression vector (Invitrogen). The construct was subjected to DNA sequencing in order to confirm that no unwanted mutation has been introduced during PCR amplification. In essence, the N-TIMP-3 was designed as a fusion protein of 115 residues with an extension of 25 amino acids at the C-terminus (Val-Asp-Ala-Ala-Ala-Glu-Gln-Lys-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-GluAsp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Ala-Ala-His-His-His-His-His-His).

N-TIMP-3 Refolding
Washed inclusion bodies of N-TIMP-3 were initially solubilized in 50 mL solubilization buffer containing 6 M guanidinium­Cl (GdmCl), 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.8 for 30 min with shaking at room temperature. Insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation (10,000g, 10 min) and the supernatant slowly diluted into 5 L refolding buffer (0.45 M GdmCl, 50 mM Tris­HCl pH 8.80) containing reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH 0.80 mM and GSSG 0.40 mM) at a rate of 0.3 mL/min. Following overnight refolding at 4°C with gentle stirring, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min to remove incorrectly folded proteins. Given the high affinity of the nickel-trinitriloacetic agarose (Ni-NTA) resin for the poly-histidine tag even in the presence of GdmCl, 10 mL prewashed (50 mM Tris­HCl, pH 7.80) Ni-NTA resin was added to the clear supernatant with constant stirring for another 2­3 h at 4°C. The resin was collected and washed with 50 mL Tris­HCl pH 7.8 before elution with 0.3 M imidazole in 50 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.8. Due to the fact that imidazole molecules excite intensely at the wavelength of 328 ­393 nm used in fluorescence spectroscopy, samples eluted from the Ni-NTA column were further desalted prior to inhibition assays. Thus, fractions containing N-TIMP-3 protein were combined, diluted and loaded onto 15 mL prewashed (20 mM Na cacodylate, pH 6.0) SP-sepharose cation exchange column. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive washing before elution with 0.3 M NaCl in Tris­HCl buffer pH 7.8. N-TIMP-3 eluted from SPsepharose column was nearly homogenous although some traces of the dimeric molecule remained present at 34 kDa. A typical yield of 3% could be expected from any refolding attempt using the protocol above.

Evaluation of N-TIMP-3 Activities
The activities of the refolded and purified N-TIMP-3 were tested using reverse zymography as well as inhibition assays with Gel-A and TACE. The purity of the final material was determined by reducing and nonreducing SDS­polyacrylamide gels. Reverse zymography was performed in 12% nonreducing SDS­polyacrylamide gel containing gelatinase A and 1 mg/mL gelatin (18). After electrophoresis, gels were washed in 2.5% Triton-X for 30 min followed by an hour in 2.5% Triton-X in 50 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.8. Gels were rinsed with distilled water several times before being transferred to incubation buffer (30 mM CaCl, 100 mM Tris­HCl pH 7.8) for overnight digestion at 37°C. The presence of gelatinolytic inhibitory activity was detected as deep blue bands following Coomassie brilliant blue staining and destaining. Before N-TIMP-3 was used for final kinetic analyses, the samples were active site titrated against Gel-A and TACE standards (14).

Sources of Full-Length TIMP-3, Gelatinase-A, TACE-473, and TACE-651
Full-length recombinant human TIMP-3 was expressed using stably transfected mouse myeloma cells and purified as described previously (15). Progelatinase-A was obtained from transfected mouse myeloma cells, purified and activated with organomercurials in accordance with the previous paper (16). TACE-473 and TACE-651 were prepared as described elsewhere (17). TACE-473 consists solely of the catalytic domain which encompasses residue 215­ 473 of the TACE polypeptide. TACE-651, on the other hand, was the longer form extending to residue-651, thus incorporating virtually the complete section of disintegrin, EGF-like domains in addition to part of the Crambin-like subdomain at the C-terminus (17).

Kinetic Studies Expression of N-TIMP-3 in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLys
Ultracompetent host cells E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys were transformed with N-TIMP-3 plasmid and plated out on Luria-Bertani plates containing 100 g/mL ampicillin. After overnight incubation at 37°C, the bacterial lawn was suspended into 2L 2YT medium enriched with 0.2% glucose. Cells were grown at 37°C and induced by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-thio- -D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) when absorbance A 600 reached 0.4. The culture was continued for another 4 hours before harvesting. The expression level of N-TIMP-3 was typically 40 ­50% of total cell lysates and the washed pellet contained at least 90% recombinant protein as judged by SDS­PAGE. Before any refolding work was carried out, inclusion bodies were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-his tag monoclonal antibody to confirm the presence of the poly-histidine residues. K iapp measurement. Recombinant TACE-473 (0.5 nM) and TACE651 (1.0 nM) were preincubated with full-length or N-TIMP-3 (0 to 100 nM) at room temperature for 3 h prior to steady-state velocities (V s) measurement. Quenched fluorescent peptides QF-45 (1 M) and QF-24 (1 M) were used as substrates in TACE and Gel-A assays as previously reported (6, 19). Apparent inhibition constants K iapp were estimated by least-square fit to Eq. [1] for competitive tight-binding inhibition:

k on (association rate constant) measurement. k on was measured by following the rate of inhibition by TIMP-3 using a continuous fluorometric activity assay (6). All k on and K iapp experiments were performed at 25°C in FAB buffer (10 mM CaCl 2, 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 0.02% NaN 3, 0.05% Brij-35, 100 mM NaCl, 1% DMSO). Measurements were repeated at least three times to confirm the reproducibility of the data.

RESULTS Expression and Refolding of Recombinant N-TIMP-3 In this report recombinant N-TIMP-3 protein contains 140 amino acids, 115 of which are contributed by human TIMP-3 cDNA and the rest from the myc and histidine sequence. For the ease of downstream purification, N-TIMP-3 was designed with six consecutive histidine residues at the C-terminus. Four hours postinduction with IPTG, N-TIMP-3 was detected at a level of 40% of total cell lysates. After refolding, we typically generated 3 mg of active N-TIMP-3 protein/100 mg inclusion bodies. The final yield of N-TIMP-3 appeared to be low in comparison with TIMP-1 and -2, which regularly exceeded 20% in most refolding attempts (M. Hutton, personal communication). Judging by nonreducing SDS­PAGE, the refolded N-TIMP-3 was at least 95% homogenous (Fig. 1). There was another unexpected form of N-TIMP-3 that migrated at 34 kDa and was resistant to reduction with -mercaptoethanol as well as heat denaturation. Subsequent Western blotting with an anti-histidine tag and an anti-TIMP-3 polypeptide monoclonal antibodies confirmed the identity of the 34 kDa form as a N-TIMP-3 dimer (results not shown). During the process of purification, this dimeric

N-TIMP-3 was consistently present but constituted less than 5% of the final purified materials. However, only the monomeric N-TIMP-3 was capable of inhibiting Gel-A in reverse zymography (Fig. 2). No band could be detected at the dimeric position. Thus, it seemed that only the monomeric protein was biologically active. Under nondenaturing conditions, N-TIMP-3 protein solubilized from inclusion bodies migrated as 17 kDa band in SDS­PAGE and reverse zymography. In the presence of -mercaptoethanol, the protein migrated slightly more slowly at 18 kDa (data not shown). Determination of Kinetic Constants (k on and K iapp) with Gel-A Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate the binding properties of full-length TIMP-3 and N-TIMP-3 with Gel-A. We have previously described that wild-type TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 displayed femto to picomolar range of K iapp with Gel-A (20, 21). In fact, with a K iapp substantially

crease in affinity suggests that the C-terminal domain of TACE, in effect, reduces its own binding tightness with TIMP-3. Association Rate (k on) with TACE-473, TACE-651 If TACE and TIMP-3 C-terminal domains genuinely play no part in binary complex formation, this should be reflected in the k on values. As demonstrated in Table 2, TIMP-3 with and without its C-domain displays comparable k on values with TACE-473 and TACE-651 (3­10 10 5 M 1 s 1 with TACE-473 and 0.4 ­1.0 10 5 M 1 s 1 with TACE-651). Apparently, truncation of the C-domain has no major impact on association rate constants. Hence the data reinforced our deduction that the C-terminal domain of TIMP-3 has little effect on TACE-binding. Of note, the 10-fold lower association rate of TACE-651 versus TACE-473 complements the K iapp results in section 3.3. Collectively, the data further strengthen our notions that the C-terminal domain of TACE does not contribute positively towards TIMP-3 association. DISCUSSION Currently, the TIMP family is comprised of four members (TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4). Except for a few highly conserved "hot spots", primary sequence alignment revealed only 30 ­35% sequence homology. The most highly conserved region, however, is located in the N-terminal portion. TIMP-1 and -2 have been successfully crystallized and structurally delineated, either in unbound form or in complexes with other MMPs (7­11). Structural elucidation to date confirmed the overall folding and topological similarity of TIMP-1 and -2 (7­9). Notwithstanding the divergence in primary sequence, it would not be unreasonable to propose that TIMP-3 shares a similar backbone. All TIMPs contain six disulfide bonds, three in each opposing domains. Studies carried out in this laboratory have indicated that full-length TIMP-3 has a much higher propensity for aggregation upon dilution in lower denaturing conditions (unpublished). N-TIMP-3, on the other hand, is more readily refoldable, even though the yield of 3% is comparatively lower than those for TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. One of the main contributors to the failure of refolding is the formation of incorrect disulfide linkage between cysteine residues in a semi-folded nascent polypeptide. The recalcitrant nature of full-length TIMP-3 versus its counterparts might be in part, due to certain amino acids that for one reason or another, render the encounter of the "right" pair of cysteine molecules energetically unfavourable. The negligible role of the C-terminal domains of TACE and TIMP-3 in the formation of the binary complex echoes our earlier observations on stromelysin-1

Note. k on measurement was initiated by adding TIMP into the cuvettes at 25°C. Association was allowed to proceed for at least 4 h in order to achieve steady-state velocity (V s).

lower than 5 pM, the exact value could not be accurately measured using a continuous fluorescent assay. Deletion of the C-domain of TIMP-3, however, resulted in at least a 2-order of magnitude increase in K iapp (0.25 nM) (Table 1). In parallel with the huge reduction in binding affinity, the association rate k on also decreases dramatically by at least 1,000-fold (Table 2). The data presented in this study harmonize our previous findings on C-terminally truncated Gel-A, i.e., the association between hemopexin domain of Gel-A and C-terminal domain of TIMP-3 made an important contribution to the k on value (21). In general, TIMP-2 has been studied in greater detail than TIMP-3, mainly due to the relative straightforwardness involved in its refolding. TIMP-2 has been shown to bind to Gel-A via its C-domain interactions with the enzyme hemopexin modules (14, 20). Recent mutagenesis and domain-swapping experiments on the hemopexin modules by our group and Overall et al. indeed highlighted the significance of residues 560 ­ 630 required in the formation of tight complexes with TIMP-2 C-terminus (22, 23). Although such a detailed screening has not been carried out on any TIMP C-domain, in our opinion, there is little doubt that TIMP-3 exerts its inhibitory action on Gel-A in a manner more or less similar to TIMP-2. Inhibition Assays (K iapp) with TACE-473, TACE-651 When N-TIMP-3 is compared with full-length TIMP-3 in TACE inhibition assays, an entirely different scenario emerged. Table 1 shows that full-length and N-TIMP-3 display nearly identical binding affinities with respect to both TACE-473 and TACE-651. In the case of TACE-473, which consists solely of the active catalytic domain, full-length and N-TIMP-3 have equal K iapp values of 0.2 nM. Thus, whereas Gel-A binding is severely affected by the loss of TIMP-3 C-domain, TACE has equal affinity with TIMP-3 regardless of its C-terminus. The repulsive effect of the disintegrin, EGF and Crambin-like domains on final TIMP-3 binding is reflected by the slightly higher K iapp value of 0.7­1.7 nM featured in TACE-651. This small but significant de-

and TIMP-1 (13). In our previous report, we showed that removal of the C-terminal domains of either TIMP-1 or stromelysin-1 has no significant effect on association rate constants (13). Thus, it seems that the mechanism of TACE inhibition by TIMP-3 is more akin to the events taking place between TIMP-1 and stromelysin-1. In the available X-ray crystal structure of stromelysin-1 and human TIMP-1 complex, only the N-domains are shown to be in actual close contact. The C-terminal domain of stromelysin, as implied by the crystal structure, would barely touch a bound TIMP-1 molecule (11). Most interestingly, Bond and co-workers very recently reported that N-terminal domain of TIMP-3 alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis in HeLa and rat smooth muscle cells (24). So far, only TIMP-3 has been demonstrated to possess the unique ability of promoting apoptosis (25). Although the MMP/ ADAM involved in TIMP-3-mediated cell death has not been identified, preliminary cell studies indicate that the C-terminus is not required for its in vivo inhibitory function, irrespective of the target MMP/ADAM. Mutagenesis evidence gathered hitherto on the better-studied hemopexin module of Gel-A suggests that, among others, a cluster of cationic residues is indispensable for TIMP-2 C-domain binding (23). TACE differs from Gel-A by having a C-terminus comprised of totally different components. If TIMP-3 also requires a hemopexin domain-like cluster of cationic residues for firm binding, it is no surprise that the disintegrin, EGF and Crambin-like domains do not fulfill such requirements. In fact, our data suggest that TIMP-3 may be obstructed somewhat from binding to TACE by the C-terminus, possibly as a result of steric interference. This agrees with previously published data demonstrating that the C-terminal domains of TACE prevent re-association of the inhibitory TACE pro-domain in recombinant expression system (17). One of the drawbacks of measuring kinetic constants using water-soluble TACE enzymes is that the conditions in solution clearly do not depict the native environment on the cell surface. Bearing in mind that TACE is different from many MMPs by being membrane-bound, its C-terminus is firmly anchored into the cell membrane. TIMP-3, in contrast to TIMP-1, -2, and -4, is also known to be associated with extracellular matrix. It would therefore seem unrealistic to conjecture an in vivo cellular scenario solely based on in vitro kinetic observations. However, our findings highlighted the possibility that in reality, only the N-terminal domains of TACE and TIMP-3 would participate in forming a tight complex on the cell surface. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
