Introduction. The Berkeley Structural Genomics Center (BSGC) pursues an integrated structural genomics program designed to obtain a near-complete structural representation of two minimal genomes: Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), two related human and animal pathogens. The MP gene MPN428 (gi:1674097) encodes an enzyme with unknown three-dimensional (3-D) structure and no sequence homologues are found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure database.1 For technical expediency, a sequence homologue of MPN428, SP1324 (gi:15675108) from Streptococcus pyogenes, was selected as a target based on sequence homology to MPN428: [log(EPSI-BLAST2) 53, sequence identity 43.09%, chain length coverage 97.19%]. Both MPN428 and SP1324 genes were annotated as phosphotransacetylase (EC 2.3.1.8), an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl phos2 phate to coenzyme A (CoA): CH3COOPO3 CoASH 7 2 CH3COSCoA HPO4 . This sequence annotation is awaiting experimental verification. Phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase are present in nearly all anaerobic prokaryotes, playing a major role in the energy-yielding metabolism.3 Here, we report the crystal structure of SP1324 at 2.7 Å resolution determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) method. Methods. Cloning. The sequence encoding SP1324 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from Streptococcus pyogenes genomic DNA (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) using Deep Vent DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The resulting PCR product was purified and was prepared for ligation independent cloning (LIC) by treatment with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of 1 mM dTTP for 30 min at 37°C. The prepared DNA was then mixed with pLIC.B4 vector for 5 min at room temperature and transformed into DH5 . This pLIC.B4 vector was designed in our laboratory to express the target protein together with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag-maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion containing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Clones were screened by plasmid DNA analysis and transformed into BL21(DE3)/pSJS1244 for protein expression.8 Protein expression and purification. His-MBP-SP1324

fusion protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pSJS1244 cells8 upon induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside. Selenomethionyl (SeMet) protein was prepared according to the method of Doublie.9 The cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The cells were lysed by microfluidization (Microfluidics, Newton, MA), and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. The supernatant was then spun in a Beckman ultracentrifuge Ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was supplemented with 10 mM imidazole before being applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Metal Chelating (Ni2 ) column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). The protein was eluted with a 10 column-volume (CV) linear gradient from 10 to 200 mM imidazole in the same buffer. The fusion protein eluted in the gradient at 80 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4°C against 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and 5% glycerol in the presence of TEV protease. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a 5 mL HiTrap Metal Chelating (Ni2 ) column. The cleaved recombinant protein was found in the flow through. Size exclusion column was performed on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) as the final step of purification. The purity of the expressed protein was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis and electrospray mass spectrometry. The protein was concentrated in an Apollo 10K unit (Orbital Biosciences, Topsfield, MA) in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.3 M NaCl to a final concentration of 25 mg/mL. Crystallization. Screening for crystallization conditions was performed using the sparse matrix sampling method10 with commercially prepared screening kits (Hampton Re-

search, Laguna Niguel, CA). The optimal condition was found to be 0.1 M BisTris, pH 5.5, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350), and 0.2 M NaCl using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. Rod-like crystals grew within a week to dimensions of 0.03 0.03 0.2 mm. The crystals were transferred to a drop of mother liquor supplemented with 1.4 M sodium formate as cryoprotectant for 10 s before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and exposed to x-ray. Structure determination and refinement. The X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Macromolecular Crystallography facility beam line 5.0.2 of the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory equipped with a Quantum 4 CCD detector (Area Detector System Corporation, Poway, CA). A three-wavelength MAD data set was collected with a Se-Met crystal to 2.7 Å resolution. The diffraction data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL program suite.11 The data statistics are summarized in Table I. The crystal belongs to the primitive cubic space group P4332, with unit-cell dimensions of a b c 173.73 Å. With two molecules in an asymmetric unit, the solvent content of the unit cell is 59.6%. The Se atom positions were located using the program SOLVE.12 Eighteen Se sites were found in an asymmetric unit out of a total of 20 possible sites. SOLVE-calculated phases were subjected to 10 cycles of refinement and solvent flattening followed by noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging using the program DM .13 A twofold NCS matrix was determined on the basis of the Se positions. The resulting map allowed building of an initial partial model using the program O. Refinement was carried out in CNS14 against the remote data set between 20 and 2.7 Å and reached convergence after several alternating cycles of manual building and refinement. Two residues from the C-terminus are not visible in the electron density. NCS restraints between two monomers were applied throughout the refinement. Ten percent of the data were randomly picked for free R factor crossvalidation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table I. The Ramachandran plot of the structure shows that 80.6% of

residues have a , angle in most favored regions, 18.4% in additional allowed regions, 1.0% in generally allowed regions, and none in disallowed regions. Atomic coordinates have been deposited into the PDB with access code 1R5J. Results. SP1324 is present as a dimer in a crystallographic asymmetric unit. Each monomer is folded into an / architecture and consists of two domains with approximate dimensions of 72 52 36 Å3 (Fig.1). Two domains are built around an 11-stranded central -sheet and separated by a distinct cleft. The central large -sheet is composed of mixed parallel and antiparallel -strands and has a remarkable left-handed twist of 200°. Domain I (residues 1­144 and 299 ­329) contains the N- and C-terminal segments, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-like nucleotide-binding fold (Rossmann fold),4 and a helical subdomain consisting of four -helices. Notably, all -strands in this domain are parallel. Domain II (residues 145­298) adopts a typical / sandwich structure and interacts with the domain II of another monomer (see below). Part of this domain consists of parallel helices packed on either side of the parallel section of the -sheet, somewhat reminiscent of the LDH-like nucleotidebinding fold. However, the topology is quite different from that of LDH. The crystallographic asymmetric unit of SP1324 crystal contains a dimer of the protein and the two monomers are related by a noncrystallographic twofold axis as shown in Figure 2. Two parallel -helices in domain II of one monomer are in contact with the corresponding helices of the other monomer to form a parallel four-helix bundle at the interface. A closer look at the interface indicates that the interactions between monomers are very extensive and tight, as manifested by many hydrophobic interactions commonly observed in biologically functional oligomer interfaces.5 In addition, the surface area buried by the dimer (1507 Å2 for each monomer) is comparable to those from other oligomeric proteins and is larger than the area buried by typical crystal contacts.5 These observations lead to the suggestion that the observed dimer may be a biological form rather than a

crystallization artifact, which is reinforced by the fact that a similar dimerization mode has been found in structures that have similar 3-D fold to SP1324 (see below). Structural homology search using DALI6 algorithm in PDB revealed that the overall structure of SP1324 including both domain I and domain II has significant structural similarity with isocitrate dehydrogenase (1ISO) and 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (1CNZ) despite low sequence identity. These two enzymes belong to a class of bifunctional decarboxylating dehydrogenases and share a common structural framework and catalytic mechanism but have different substrate and cofactor specificities.7 The dimerization modes of these two dehydrogenases are very similar to that of SP1324, forming a parallel four-helix bundle at the interface. The main differences are that no LDH-like nucleotide-binding fold is present in the corresponding domains of 1ISO or 1CNZ, both having distinct coenzyme binding motifs. SP1324 does not have any protruding part in domain II as present in the other two structures. The presence of the LDH-like nucleotidebinding fold in domain I of SP1324, and the structural similarities of domain I to the coenzyme-binding domains of two dehydrogenases imply that domain I is involved in the binding of coenzyme A, the substrate of phosphotransacetylases. However, it remains to be seen which kind of binding motif SP1324 adopts: the one utilized by 1ISO and 1CNZ, the one employed by LDH-like classes of nucleotidebinding proteins, or a novel one.
