Type 2 diabetes is a polygenic disease which afflicts nearly 200 million people worldwide and is expected to increase to near epidemic levels over the next 10-15 years. Glucokinase (GK) activators are currently under investigation by a number of pharmaceutical companies with only a few reaching early clinical evaluation. A GK activator has the promise of potentially affecting both the -cells of the pancreas, by improving glucose sensitive insulin secretion, as well as the liver, by reducing uncontrolled glucose output and restoring post-prandial glucose uptake and storage as glycogen. Herein, we report our efforts on a sulfonamide chemotype with the aim to generate liver selective GK activators which culminated in the discovery of 3-cyclopentyl-N-(5-methoxy-thiazolo[5,4-b]pyridin-2-yl)-2-[4-(4-methylpiperazine-1-sulfonyl)-phenyl]-propionamide (17c). This compound activated the GK enzyme (RKa = 39 nM) in vitro at low nanomolar concentrations and significantly reduced glucose levels during an oral glucose tolerance test in normal mice.
Introduction Excessive hepatic glucose production and inappropriate glucose sensing by pancreatic -cells contribute in a major way to the resulting whole-body insulin resistance and hyperglycemia associated with type 2 diabetes. Glucokinase (GKa) is a high Km hexokinase present in key glucose metabolizing tissues (liver and pancreas) that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. The enzyme serves as a substrate switch in these tissues, thus controlling the fate of glucose disposal subsequent to a meal and thereby plays a central role in whole-body glucose homeostasis. In the liver, GK is the rate-limiting enzyme controlling glucose utilization, and its activation promotes glycogen synthesis (Figure 1). The balance between the rate of glucose phosphorylation by GK and dephosphorylation by glucose-6phosphatase determines the net glucose flux into or out of this tissue. In the diabetic state, control of this balance is lost, and the liver exports glucose continuously even during the fed state. A GK activator should overcome this effect and allow the liver to take up glucose and store it as glycogen during the prandial state. In the pancreatic -cells, GK serves as the glucose sensor and controls the insulin response to a specific glucose load. In the diabetic situation, this sensor is defective,

and insufficient insulin is released to bring glucose levels back into the normal range resulting in hyperglycemia. A GK activator should lower the glucose set point at which insulin is released and thereby work in concert with lower glucose output by the liver to effectively normalize plasma glucose concentrations. A number of reviews have been published in this area.1 Activation of GK both in the liver and the pancreas should have a profound effect on circulating glucose levels in the diabetic state. However, there are serious concerns that targeting the pancreas would not only result in an increased potential for hypoglycemia but more significantly result in increased stress on the -cells, similar to that observed with long-term treatment with sulfonylureas, and thereby lead to -cell failure and ultimately a worsening of the diabetic state. For this reason, our effort has focused on compounds whose

effects are minimized in the pancreas and primarily directed to the liver. The patient benefit of a liver-selective GK activator, although likely a safer therapy as compared to a pancreastargeted agent, has yet to be proven in the clinic. Herein, we will describe efforts toward developing our first GK activator, which culminated in the discovery of R(-)17c, as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes. Most early published efforts have reported an amidine moiety as a necessary component of the GK activator binding motif, which from internal and published crystallographic information forms key interactions with the protein backbone of Arg63. This interaction anchors the compound and allows additional interactions, which ultimately maintain helix 13 of the small domain in the desired active conformation of the protein and prevent the undesired orientation commonly referred to as the super-open conformation. This super-open conformation has been described earlier as a nonfunctional form of the enzyme, which in the case of the liver allows for interaction with glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP).2 This interaction of GK with GKRP is suspected to provide both regulation and protection of GK during times when its activity is not required. A high throughput screening effort identified a key lead, 1 (Figure 2), which was shown to directly activate GK and as well contained the requisite amidine core. Utilizing the pyridoaminothiazole as our amidine counterpart, we elected to push beyond the sulfone chemotype as exemplified by 2a (RO0280450)3 and others and explore sulfonamides due both

to their synthetic accessibility via parallel synthesis techniques as well as their potential for improved physiochemical properties. Chemistry. Compounds were prepared as illustrated in either Scheme 1 or Scheme 2. All amines utilized were commercially available. Synthesis via Method A (Scheme 1). The ethyl ester of phenyl acetic acid was treated with chlorosulfonic acid under heating to afford a mixture of sulfonyl chlorides, 3. The resulting mixture was carried on crude and treated with the desired amine to afford a mixture of sulfonamides, which were separated by crystallization or chromatography to provide the pure para isomer, 4. Examination of this mixture unexpectedly indicated two regioisomers which were not an ortho/para mixture but actually an 80:20 mixture of para/meta.4 The only examples sited in the literature of metachlorosulfonylation have been when additional directing groups have contributed to and potentially determined the regiochemical outcome.5 In addition, while Friedel-Crafts acylation of ethyl phenylacetate does give substantial amounts of the meta product and very little if any ortho product because of the size of the acylating complex,6 nitration of methyl phenylacetate generates no meta product with only ortho and para (o:p ratio 15:85).7 Therefore, it appears that the substrate, ethyl phenylacetate, is somewhat variable in its chemistry with regard to electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with the acetate unit neither functioning as a good activating ortho/para nor a good deactivating

meta director with the outcome of higher meta product under some conditions than one would have expected. Subsequent conversion of 4 to its enolate with LDA and alkylation with cyclopentylmethyliodide afforded 5. Saponification of the ester under standard conditions afforded 6, which was subjected to traditional peptide coupling with the pyridoaminothiazole, 7, to afford the desired compounds 13-17. Isolation of the R(-) isomer, if desired could be accomplished using chiral HPLC. This procedure, although efficient, cost-effective, and scalable, introduced the major site of diversity early in the route, and an alternative method which allowed for the diversification step late in the synthesis was desired. Synthesis by Method B (Scheme 2). An alternate route beginning with ethyl p-nitrophenylacetate proved to be both straightforward and effective, especially with regard to variation in the sulfonamide. Alkylation of ethyl p-nitrophenylacetate with cyclopentyl methyl iodide as described before afforded 8. Subsequent saponification of the ester and peptide coupling with pyridoaminothiazole 7 then resulted in 10. Reduction of the nitro functionality to the aniline 11 was followed by diazotization. This material was then treated with sulfur dioxide in acetic acid in the presence of copper chloride to afford the sulfonyl chloride, 12, in this case as the pure para-isomer because of the employment of the nitro group to direct the regiochemical outcome. This material could then be quenched with various amines or with ammonium hydroxide to afford 13-17 as shown in Scheme 2. Evaluation of Compounds. Primary in Vitro Assay. The standard method of testing compounds involved reporting S0.5 in addition to a corresponding percent activation (Vmax) at a fixed glucose concentration (10 mM). However, evaluation at both multiple compound (0-20 M) as well as multiple glucose (300 M-100 mM) concentrations followed by analysis of the data according to Segal et al.8 allowed for S0.5 and Vmax to be reported in a single value, RKa, which provided a comprehensive single comparator between compounds (see Table 1). While employing this matrix evaluation, three specific classes of compounds were found: (1) compounds which activated GK by decreasing the S0.5 of glucose with little or no change in Vmax; (2) compounds which showed little if any change in activity across

glucose levels; and (3) compounds which actually showed inverted activity upon increasing glucose concentrations, activating glucose phosphorylation at lower glucose concentrations but inhibiting phosphorylation at higher glucose concentrations. Compounds selected as highest priority were as expected those of class 1, which showed increasing activity with increasing glucose levels. Compounds of class 3 should theoretically be less desirable as therapeutic agents as they would have no effect at higher glucose concentrations where their efficacy is most needed. The optimum profile would entail a maximum effect at high glucose levels, thereby countering hyperglycemia, and little if no effect at lower glucose levels, thus preventing further glucose uptake when hypoglycemia could result. Compounds of this type were not found in our evaluation of this chemotype. Hepatocyte Assay. Evaluation of potency in a cellular model was performed not only to validate the compound's effect on endogenous GK activity but additionally to serve as an early permeability filter for selecting compounds for in vivo evaluation. The rate of glucose metabolism by hepatocytes is dependent on GK activity levels.9 Effects on glucose phosphorylation were assessed in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes as determined by the release of 3H2O from [2-3H]glucose. A discrepancy is noted between the in vitro RKa and the % GK activation in hepatocytes. Given that the endogenous rat GK protein shares 94% amino acid identity with the recombinant human GK, differences in the enzyme source are most likely not the cause. Furthermore, the GK protein (aa 17-466) used for in vitro assays displayed activity similar to that of the full-length protein (data not shown), indicating that the N-terminal truncation does not alter the kinetics of GK. One possibility to explain the discrepancy in assay values could be due to protein binding of the compounds in cells; however, neither the primary in vitro assay nor the hepatocyte culture medium contained a source of serum albumin. Other factors such as permeability, clearance, as well as metabolism of the compounds in hepatocytes could contribute to effects on GK activity (i.e., by reducing or enhancing it) that would not be observed in the in vitro assay and therefore need to be taken into account. In addition, it is possible that there is a minimum threshold of effect required for GK phosphorylation which

results in the signal being generated (3H20 release), and this is not met with certain compounds. It should be noted that when GK activation was greater than 200%, the values were considered meaningful. Values falling below 200%, although statistically relevant, were not used as a single criteria warranting in vivo evaluation. Physiochemical Properties. Estimation of physiochemical properties considered critical to understanding in vivo exposure are routinely evaluated during drug discovery efforts and used to prioritize compounds warranting further examination in

vivo. Within this chemotype, permeability was evaluated using a parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) and compounds with high in vitro permeability were considered for in vivo evaluation.10 The data is reported as log PGI and is the highest of the 3 measured values (pH 4, pH 6.8, and pH 8). A ranking of H (high), M (medium), and L (low) is attached to these results and corresponds to the estimated fraction absorbed.11 High throughput solubility measurements were used to evaluate a compound's ability to dissolve or at least disperse in the gut and allow for sufficient passive diffusion through the

gut wall.12 Evaluation of microsomal stability13 of the compound provided a surrogate to in vivo exposure and half-life, and was used to further select compounds for profiling in vivo. In Vivo Activity in C57BL6 Mice. Whereas treatment with a GK activator was not expected to alter basal glucose levels acutely in normal mice due to tight glucose regulation, a reduction in the glucose excursion (glucose AUC) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was expected and was used to differentiate between compounds. In Vivo Activity in Diet Induced Obese (DIO) Mice. A lipid driven model of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes was used. Effects observed in this model should be more profound than in normal mice. Intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) was used to assess activity in -cells. Results and Discussion Our approach focused on a series of sulfonamides beginning with the simplest primary sulfonamide, 13a.14 This compound was similar in activity to the external comparator, 2a (Figure 2), but also demonstrated good permeability and sufficient stability in microsomes (Table 1) to warrant evaluation in vivo. Oral administration of 13a (50 mg/kg), produced a modest though nonsignificant reduction in glucose AUC during an OGTT. It is likely that poor aqueous solubility of 13a (<0.002 g/L) contributed to the low exposures observed in vivo. A prodrug strategy was briefly investigated using short chain carboxamides of 13a. Compounds 13b and 13c showed improved water solubility as their sodium salts than 13a (0.011 and 0.026 g/L, respectively). Subsequent evaluation of in vivo exposure of 13b and 13c showed significantly improved plasma (10-fold Cmax) and liver exposures (5-fold) of the active entity, 13a, when dosed as a prodrug as compared to that with the administration of the parent drug (13a) (Figure 3). Whereas this improved exposure should have translated into improved efficacy during an OGTT in mice, unexpectedly, 13b showed no effect on glucose AUC. Because of the inherent difficulties with advancing prodrugs through development, such as species and patient variation in cleavage extent and timing, as well as others, this approach was set aside in preference to a traditional medicinal chemistry investigation of variations in the sulfonamide moiety. Early in the investigation of this series, it became clear that exposure would be the key hurdle and that it would be driven by intrinsic aqueous solubility, gut dissolution rate, and permeability.

Substitution of the primary amine of sulfonamide 13a with a variety of lipophilic dialkyl amines provided compounds 14a-e, which showed up to 20-fold improvement in in vitro potency over that of 13a. Compounds 14a and 14b were evaluated in isolated rat hepatocytes and produced 2- and 3-fold increases in glucose turnover, respectively, as measured by 3H2O release. Whereas 14b looked especially promising, it showed poor permeability and faster clearance compared to those of 14a, with no improvement in aqueous solubility.15 Analogues derived from monosubstituted amine derivatives were also evaluated and as a whole demonstrated improved in vitro activity as compared to 13a but rarely approached the activity exhibited by 14b. Although a phenyl substitution (14f) provided only a modest improvement, 3-pyridyl (14g) improved activity nearly 3-fold over 13a. Compounds with saturated rings (14h-14j) provided a similar 3-fold improvement in activation over that of 13a but did not achieve the activity of the disubstituted series 14a-c. A series of benzylated sulfonamide analogues (14k-14p) were prepared, which in general showed modest improvement compared to that of 13a. As it was quite clear at this point that solubility was an important parameter necessary for in vivo activity, basic amino groups were included in our selections. The most interesting compound in the group was 14l, which showed a 2-fold improvement over 13a in the in vitro enzymatic assay and a 3-fold increase in the cellular assay. In addition, 14l along with its regioisomers, 14m and 14n, showed an improvement in aqueous solubility to nearly 0.01 g/L as a result of forming a water-soluble salt, although in vitro metabolic clearance was very rapid. Attempts were made to further improve on solubility with a selection of neutral, basic, and acidic solubilizing groups (15a-15d). Whereas neutral (15a) and basic (15b) groups provided impressive in vitro activity, aqueous solubility improved very little. However, acidic groups such as glycine (15c) and -alanine (15d) demonstrated improved intrinsic solubility (>0.57 g/L) at neutral pH, generally good permeability, and slow in vitro clearance, although they had only micromolar GK activity in vitro. Because of the much improved aqueous solubility as their potassium salts, these compounds were selected for in vivo evaluation. Surprisingly, we found that 15c demonstrated significant glucose lowering, although 15d did not. Whereas this difference could be ascribed to the reduced in vitro activity of 15d, compared to that of 15c, other unexplored factors could also be playing a part, such as -oxidation or preferential clearance of 15d by glucuronidation. A group

of N-methyl-N-substituted amine variants were also evaluated and provided some improvement over monosubstituted sulfonamides. In particular, the 2-furanylmethyl analogue 16c showed a 6-fold improvement in RKa over its counterpart secondary amine, 14o. Also of note for 16a-c is the inverse relationship observed between PAMPA permeability and clearance from microsomes, which limited further exploration into this series. Three compounds, 14l, 15a, and 16a, were selected for evaluation to determine whether solubilizing vehicles could overcome the perceived solubility limiting exposure of these compounds. Besides the microemulsion16 vehicle, other vehicles such as polyvinylpyrrolidinone (K30) and various combinations of DMI-ethanol-Tween-PEG were evaluated, but these did not provide the improvement hoped for. On the basis of the observation that disubstituted sulfonamides provided improved intrinsic activity as compared to their monosubstituted analogues, a small group of cyclic compounds were prepared. As anticipated, compounds 17a-17d provided around 10-fold improvement in RKa over that of 13a. Of most interest was the N-methyl piperazine adduct 17c, which showed significantly improved enzymatic activity (RKa = 39 nM) and also increased glucose turnover in hepatocytes by nearly 5-fold. Although 17c exhibited only a modest improvement in kinetic solubility (0.05 g/L), its corresponding HCl salt had aqueous solubility greater than 50 g/L and therefore could be dosed as an aqueous solution in vivo without extensive formulation efforts. Isolation of R(-)17c, the pure R-enantiomer of 17c was accomplished using chiral chromatography17 and exhibited an RKa of 23 nM (approximately 40-fold more active than its corresponding S-enantiomer). Although 17c has a potentially racemizable center, it was found to be quite stable and required a strong base (KOtBu) in order to racemize. This racemization then allowed, after subsequent chromatography, isolation of additional R(-)17c. We had initially planned to utilize the binding pocket from the published X-ray from Banyu18 with their analogue 2b as a model but were unable to dock our sulfonamides in this same pocket while maintaining the amidine in what would be expected to be the preferred orientation. We therefore set out to cocrystallize R(-)17c, a compound with good activity and more importantly with acceptable solubility for crystallization studies, with GK protein. These efforts provided an X-ray crystal structure of human GK in complex with glucose ° and the activator R(-)17c, determined to 2.0 A resolution. The final structure was refined to an R-factor of 19.5% (Table 3), and includes residues Gly11-Glu93, Gln98Cys461, one glucose molecule, one R(-)17c molecule, and 277 solvent molecules. Loop Gly94-Gly97 and the 4 Cterminal amino acids were not modeled because of poor electron density. The glucose binding site and the relationship between the large and small domains is consistent with the closed form of GK as reported by Banyu. The activator R(-)17c is located in the activator binding site, which is surrounded by the 1 strand and R5 helix of the large domain, the C-terminal R13 helix of the small domain, and the GK specific connecting region I (Ser64-Gly72). This ° site is approximately 20 A away from the glucose binding site. In contrast to the Banyu binding cavity, the surface of this activator binding site has been significantly expanded to allow the binding of R(-)17c. This expansion is caused by a large ° motion of the loop Val91-Lys104 (>7 A rms for the CR of Gln98) and a smaller motion of connecting region I of ° Ser64-Gly72 (2.5 A rms for the CR of Glu70). As seen in

Figure 4, the L-shaped binding site which accommodates 2b has expanded to a larger Y-shaped binding site in the R(-)17c structure based on the movement of these two regions. Specific interactions between R(-)17c and GK are shown in Figure 5. If R(-)17c is dissected into three branches, the pyridoaminothiazole branch makes hydrophobic interactions with Val455, Ala456, and Lys459 of the R13 helix, as well as Pro66 of connecting region I and Ile159 of the large domain. There is also a bidentate hydrogen bond formed between the thiazole N atom and the NH group of the amide in R(-)17c with both the backbone NH and carbonyl oxygen of Arg63 on GK. The methyl cyclopentane branch makes hydrophobic interactions with residues Tyr214, Met210, Met235, and Val62 of the large domain. The last branch, which contains the benzenesulfonylpiperazine, makes interactions in an expanded groove, with similar directionality, as previously observed in the crystal structure of GK in complex with the activator

2c (Figure 2).19 The phenyl ring packs between Tyr214 of the large domain and Val455 of the C-terminal R13 helix, with the sulfonyl orienting the methyl piperazine into a newly formed hydrophobic pocket which is surrounded by Leu451 and Val455 of R13 helix, Tyr215, and Trp99. Additionally, there is a hydrogen bond between the piperazine nitrogen and the O atom of Ser69 from the GK connecting region I. As has been described, R(-)17c makes more extensive interactions with the C-terminal R13 helix than has been previously seen. These interactions with the R13 helix have been proposed to be the cause of activation by sterically inhibiting the release of this helix from the small domain to form the super-open, inactive conformation.18 Hence, when the activator is bound, the enzyme remains in the open/closed catalytically active conformation resulting in its higher affinity for glucose. Evaluation of 17c in a standard OGTT in normal mice resulted in a significant reduction of AUC for glucose excursion as compared to that of controls (Figure 6). A manuscript with the complete evaluation of the interesting pharmacology of 17c has been submitted for publication.20 Although 17c had rapid in vitro metabolic clearance and was expected to be rapidly cleared in vivo, it showed pharmacological effects in vivo for up to 6 h. A possible explanation for this could be the presence of a long-lived active metabolite. In silico tools predicted N-demethylation of the piperazine as a likely metabolite. This was confirmed by analysis of the metabolites of 17c following exposure to rat liver microsomes and was further substantiated in PK studies, which indicated levels of both 17c and its primary N-demethylated metabolite, 17d, in the plasma and liver after oral administration of 17c (Figure 7). Consistent with 17d showing both reduced in vitro permeability and even faster metabolic clearance compared to that of 17c, it was found to be inactive when delivered orally. To further assess whether circulating concentrations of 17d

would be active at target in vivo, 17d was administered via an intravenous route, and as expected, it showed efficacy at lowering glucose AUC as did 17c delivered orally. As levels of 17d in the liver were higher than 17c at 4 h and as 17d demonstrated intrinsic activity comparable to that of 17c, it is possible that the efficacy from oral dosing of 17c was extended because of contributions from 17d. The primary goal of this approach was to identify a liver targeted compound which manifested its effects only in the liver and showed no increase in insulin release from the -cell either in the basal state or during a glucose challenge. The most straightforward way to target or at least prioritize the liver would be by selecting an agent whose distribution vastly favored the liver compared to the pancreas. Unfortunately, R(-)17c actually showed higher exposures in the pancreas as compared to the liver from PK studies performed in normal mice (Table 2). As no changes in insulin output were observed in the pancreas, it is unclear whether sufficient compound concentrations actually reached the target -cell, and no attempt was made to determine the actual exposure of -cells to the compound. With regards to the metabolite 17d, whereas its accumulation in the liver may be responsible for a more prolonged pharmacological response, 17d is unlikely to play a

role in other tissues such as the -cell because of its low circulating plasma levels (Figure 7). What is most interesting is that regardless of the exposure of R(-)17c in the whole pancreas, no indication of a -cell effect was observed in pharmacology studies examining insulin output during a glucose challenge. The results of an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), designed to specifically examine the effects of a compound on the -cell component of glucose disposal following a challenge is shown in Figure 8. Administration of R(-)17c to diet induced obese mice (DIO) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in glucose levels (glucose AUC) over the course of the experiment. Over the same time, reductions in insulin AUC were also observed, indicating decreased pancreatic output and the fact that the effects of R(-)17c on glucose lowering are not being derived from an effect in the -cell but rather is the result of improved insulin sensitivity as marked by improved glucose uptake and reduced glucose output from the liver. In separate longitudinal studies, it has also been shown that basal insulin levels are unchanged or reduced while glucose levels trend downward to normal levels over time due to drug treatment.20 In summary, the GK activator 17c has clearly demonstrated efficacy on glucose lowering in vivo primarily through its effects in the liver without any observable impact in the -cells. Conclusions We have optimized a series of sulfonamides with the generation of a number of GK activators with low nanomolar RKa. A selection of these compounds additionally exhibited improved permeability, reduced metabolic clearance rates, and significant activation of glucose phosphorylation in isolated hepatocytes. As most of the early compounds required special formulation vehicles in order to observe any in vivo activity, the incorporation of solubility handles was critical to this series. The key advancement came with 17a-17d, which combined good intrinsic activity with significant cell activity and led ultimately to watersoluble compounds as exemplified by 17c. Administration of a solution of 17c dissolved in water during an OGTT provided a dramatic flattening of the glucose excursion curve and significant in vivo activity. A cocrystal of 17c with the GK enzyme showed an expanded binding cavity as compared to that of 2b and additionally predicted a novel interaction of the piperazine nitrogen with Ser69 which could be used to design further analogues. Activation of GK in both the -cell and liver would address many of the defects inherent in type 2 diabetics by reducing liver glucose output as well as increasing the insulin response to a glucose load. However, our concern was that direct effects of a compound in the pancreas would not only further stress the -cell, leading to early -cell failure, but also increase the propensity for hypoglycemia. This insulin-induced hypoglycemia could be especially dangerous in later stage diabetics who suffer from defective glucose sensing and impaired counterregulatory response. During this effort, we selected for compounds which demonstrated their effect only in the liver and either had no effect in the pancreas or actually reduced insulin levels under fasting conditions as well as during an OGTT. As a result of this effort, R(-)17c was identified as a highly water-soluble GK activator which manifested its activity primarily in the liver. Evaluation of functional liver selective agents in the clinic should address

whether this class of GK activators will be efficacious to treat diabetes as a stand-alone therapy. Experimental Section
Anhydrous solvents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as is. Organic solutions were dried over MgSO4. Flash chromatography was performed on a Biotage SP4 system. Proton NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker AV400 spectrophotometer using TMS ( 0.0 PPM) as internal standard. Analytical and preparative chromatography were performed on a Shimadzu HPLC equipped with Phenomenex Luna C8(2) columns using from 5 to 100% acetonitrile/water both modified with 0.5% TFA. LC-MS was performed on a Water ZQ equipped with a Intersil ODS-3 (C8) column. Microanalysis was performed at Robertson Microlit Laboratories, Madison, NJ. All final compounds had purity >95% as determined by analytical HPLC and elemental analysis. Biological Methods. Matrix Evaluation of Enzyme Activity. Recombinant human liver GK (amino acids 17-466) was expressed as an N-terminal histidine (His)-tagged fusion protein in E. coli strain BL21 Star (DE3) and was purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The His-tag was then cleaved off leaving an N-terminal GPGSM extension and the protein further purified using mono Q-anion exchange chromatography followed by Superdex S200 gel filtration (GE Healthcare) to >95% purity. The protein was diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 50 mM glucose, and 20% glycerol. The GK enzyme assay was performed in a 96-well plate with each sample run in triplicate. Glucose and compound were titrated in a two-dimensional matrix using varying concentrations of each: 12 glucose concentrations (0 and 168 M to 60 mM) and 8 compound concentrations (0 and 11 nM to 20 M) were tested. Data was expressed as milli optical density (mOD) per min and were analyzed by fitting the observed rates at various concentrations of substrate and activator. A representative run for 17c is shown in Figure 9. GK Activity in Primary Hepatocytes. The rate of glucose metabolism by hepatocytes is dependent on the GK activity levels. Effects on glucose phosphorylation can be measured by the release of 3H20 from [2-3H]glucose in isolated rat hepatocytes.21 Hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase perfusion of the liver of overnight-fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as previously described.22 Cells were cultured in 24-well plates at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in serum-free DMEM medium containing 5 mM glucose and 10 mM dexamethasone for 16-20 h prior to use. Glucose phosphorylation was determined by the release of 3H20 from [2-3H]glucose essentially as previously described.23 Assays were run in quadruplicate. Briefly, cells were preincubated in serum-free DMEM containing 5 mM glucose and DMSO (control) or 30 M compound for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by a 30 min incubation with [2-3H]glucose. On termination of the incubations, the medium was collected into 0.1 M HCl. The amount of glucose

Differences were considered statistically significant by two-tailed Student's t-test (p < 0.05). Effect on Glucose Excursion during an OGTT. Fifteen week old male C57BL6 mice (n = 8/group), housed two per cage with normal chow diet and reversed light cycle, were fasted for 3 h. Body weights were then measured and 0-h blood samples taken. Plasma glucose values were determined using a glucose meter, and plasma samples (10 L) were saved for insulin assay. Animals were grouped with means of plasma glucose matched. Vehicle (microemulsion) or compounds (in microemulsion) at doses of 50 mg/kg for the reference compound, 2a, or 72 mg/kg (a molar equivalent dose to 2a) for 17c were administered by oral gavage in a volume of 5 mL/kg. Glucose was administered orally 30 min after vehicle/compound administration at 1 g/kg (5 mL/kg). Blood samples were taken at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h post-dosing for glucose and insulin measurements. Effect on Glucose Excursion during IVGTT in DIO Mice. Male C57BL6 mice maintained on high fat diet were administered orally with vehicle (dH2O) or compound at 30 to 100 mg/ kg dose once daily for 8 weeks. An intravenous glucose tolerance test was conducted after 8-weeks of treatment, and plasma glucose excursion (left panel) and plasma insulin AUC (0-120 min; right panel) were calculated. X-ray Crystallization. Human GK (17-466) with an N-terminal GPGSM extension from cloning was concentrated to 10 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM TCEP and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with a final concentration of 20 mM glucose and 300 M R(-)17c. The GK/glucose/R(-)17c complex was centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C at 20,000g, and the supernatant was used for crystallization. Three hundred nanoliters of complex was mixed with 300 nL of well solution (100 mM HEPES, pH 6.0, 20% PEG 3350, and 200 mM NaCl) and incubated at 4 °C. Hexagonal rod shaped crystals were observed at approximately 30 days. The crystals were cryoprotected with the addition of 20% glycerol and 100 M R(-)17c for 5 min at 4 °C prior to flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. Structure Determination. Diffraction data for the GK/glucose/R(-)17c complex were collected on a Saturn 92 CCD ° detector using Cu KR radiation ( = 1.5418 A) from a Rigaku FR-E microfocus rotating anode X-ray generator at 45 kV and 45 mA, with Varimax optics. The data were measured from a single crystal, and the reflections were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 package.24 The space group of the GK/glucose/R(-)17c complex was P212121 with 1 complex in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was performed using PHASER,25 with the initial model of GK/glucose/ 2-amino-4-fluoro-5-[(1-methyl-1h-imidazol- 2-yl)sulfanyl]-N(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)benzamide complex (PDB entry 1V4S) with water, sodium ion, glucose, and inhibitor molecules removed. Structure determination was achieved through iterative cycles of both positional and simulated annealing refinement using CNX26 and model building using COOT.27 Individual B-factors were refined using an overall anisotropic B-factor refinement along with bulk solvent correction. The glucose, sodium ion, solvent and R(-)17c molecules were built in later rounds of refinement. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 3. Chemical Methods.

(4) Utilizing standard chlorosulfonic acid conditions (-0 °C to RT) gave the para/meta mixture, while reaction at lower temperatures (-78 °C) resulted in only sulfonic acid, which upon warming resulted in the same 80:20 mixture. Heating the reaction to 75 °C as well did not alter the product ratio but instead decomposed. Fluorosulfonic acid as well as standard nitration methods gave identical outcomes.
