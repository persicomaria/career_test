Abstract EHD1 is a member of the mammalian C-terminal Eps15 homology domain (EH) containing protein family, and regulates the recycling of various receptors from the endocytic recycling compartment to the plasma membrane. The EH domain of EHD1 binds to proteins containing either an Asn-Pro-Phe or Asp-Pro-Phe motif, and plays an important role in the subcellular localization and function of EHD1. Thus far, the structures of five N-terminal EH domains from other proteins have been solved, but to date, the structure of the EH domains from the four C-terminal EHD family paralogs remains unknown. In this study, we have assigned the 133 C-terminal residues of EHD1, which includes the EH domain, and solved its solution structure. While the overall structure resembles that of the second of the three N-terminal Eps15 EH domains, potentially significant differences in surface charge and the structure of the tripeptide-binding pocket are discussed.

containing vesicles to a compartment known as the early endosome. Receptors are then transported to the endosome/ lysosome pathway for degradation, or recycled back to the plasma membrane. While some receptors are delivered directly back to the plasma membrane in a ``fast recycling'' pathway, many receptors are recycled in a highly regulated manner through a series of tubular and vesicular membranes collectively known as the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC), in a process known as ``slow recycling''. Among the important regulators of endocytic recycling that have been well characterized are the Rabfamily of small GTP-binding proteins and their effectors, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins involved in membrane fusion. More recently, an additional group of proteins, known as the C-terminal Eps15 Homology Domain (EHD) proteins, has also been implicated in the regulation of endocytic recycling (reviewed in (Naslavsky and Caplan 2005). The best characterized family member, EHD1, acts primarily at the ERC to regulate the exit of various receptors from this compartment, including the transferrin receptor (Lin et al. 2001), MHC class I molecules (Caplan et al. 2002) and b1 integrin receptors (Jovic et al. 2007). All four highly homologous EHD mammalian paralogs contain an N-terminal nucleotide-binding motif, a central coiled-coil region, and an Eps15 Homology (EH) domain localized to the C-terminus of the protein. The EH domain is conserved evolutionarily in species as diverse as yeast and homo sapiens, and serves as a protein­ protein interaction module that facilitates binding to other endocytic regulators containing the asparagine-prolinephenylalanine (NPF) motif and potentially also to proteins containing aspartate-proline-phenylalanine (DPF) motif (Whitehead et al. 1999). Recent studies have revealed that EHD1 interacts with Rab effectors, including the divalent

Rab4/Rab5 effector Rabenosyn-5 (Naslavsky et al. 2004) and the Rab11 effector, Rab11-FIP2 (Naslavsky et al. 2006), as well as the SNARE protein SNAP29/GS32, Syndapins I and II and other proteins involved in endocytic regulation (reviewed in Naslavsky and Caplan 2005). These interactions are mediated through the binding of the EH domain to the NPF motifs of the interacting proteins. Several studies aimed at dissecting the nature of other EH domains interacting with NPF motifs have revealed the importance of a hydrophobic pocket within the EH domain, where the NPF motif is capable of tightly interacting with a conserved tryptophan residue within the EH domain (de Beer et al. 1998, 2000). Accordingly, truncation of the EH domain alters the distribution of EHD1 in cells (Caplan et al. 2002) suggesting that this domain contains important localization signals. Furthermore the EH domains of EHD1 and Eps15 were recently shown to be capable of phosphatidylinositol binding (Naslavsky et al. 2007), thus expanding the functional importance of this domain. To date, structural analysis of the EH domain has been limited to the more common EH domain-containing proteins with an EH domain(s) localized to their N-terminus. For example, the solution structures of the three Eps15

N-terminal EH domains were solved, as well as the EH domain of POB1, and Reps1 (reviewed in Confalonieri and Di Fiore 2002). Here, we report the solution structure of the C-terminal EH domain (residues 401­534) of EHD1. This is an important step in progression towards a better understanding of the molecular processes guiding EHD1mediated receptor recycling.

Methods and results The EH domain of EHD1 (residues 401­534) was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-6P-2 (GST-tagged; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) by standard PCR methods. Rosetta bacterial cells (Novagen, Madison, WI) transformed with the pGEX-6P-2 vector containing the EHD1 EH domain gene were grown in 1 L of minimum M63 media in the presence of 15N-ammonium chloride and 13 C-glucose and induced with 120 mg of IPTG at a cell density of 0.8 OD600 for 4 h. The bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1· Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 containing the Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and

1 mM DTT. The cells were lysed by French Press and 1 mM PMSF and 1% NP-40 were added before separation of the lysate from the intact cells by centrifugation (12,000g, 20 min). The GST-tagged EHD1 EH domain was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and the GST-tag was cleaved by incubation with 160 units of PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) in PBS buffer overnight and concentrated using an Amicon Centriplus YM-10 column. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were acquired at 25°C using a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer fitted with a cold probe. Backbone sequential assignments were obtained using the following 3D experiments: HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, and HNHA spectra. The 15N-HSQC spectrum of the EHD1 EH domain is shown in Fig. 1A. All backbone signals were assigned except for the amide proton of Val441, Asn478 and Thr479. The side chain chemical shifts were obtained from the 3D 13C-HCCH-TOCSY and 15N-TOCSY-HSQC

experiments. Aromatic side chains were assigned using a 2D TOCSY and 3D 13C-edited NOESY (aromatic). The chemical shift assignments were deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession code: 15279). All data were processed with the NMRPipe program (Delaglio et al. 1995) and analyzed with NMRView (Johnson 1994). Distance constraints were derived from NOEs observed in the 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectra, each with mixing times of 150 ms. Model structures were calculated by using the program ARIA 1.2 (Linge et al. 2001), as implemented in the Crystallography & NMR System (CNS) 1.1 software (Brunger et al. 1998; Linge et al. 2001). The input data consisted of the chemical shifts obtained from the resonance assignments, cross-peak positions and volumes from the 15N-NOESY-HSQC and 13 C-NOESY-HSQC spectra without assignment, 3JHN-Ha coupling constants from the HNHA spectrum, and hydrogen bonds based on deuterium exchange experiments. During the first ARIA run, an automated calibration was performed,

unassigned NOE peaks were assigned, distance restraints were generated, and the 3D protein structures were calculated. At the end of each run, rejected restraints and residual NOE violations were analyzed. The new assignments were checked and introduced or omitted in the subsequent run. This procedure of assignment/refinement was repeated iteratively until the completion of the NOESY spectra assignments. In the final iteration, the 50 structures with the lowest restraint energy values were further refined by molecular dynamics simulation in water to remove artifacts (Linge et al. 2003). The final restraint file containing both ambiguous and unambiguous restraints was used as a reference for the next calculation. Previous studies have shown that EH domains contains either `canonical' or `pseudo' EF-hands that bind calcium to stabilize the EH domain structure (de Beer et al. 1998; Strynadka and James 1989). This stabilization was evident when the 15N-HSQC spectrum of the EHD1 EH domain in the presence of calcium was overlaid with the 15N-HSQC spectrum in its absence. Calcium caused the reappearance of a number (*30) of resonances (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that in the absence of calcium, the residues comprising the EF-hand were in intermediate exchange with the solvent and calcium stabilized this region as evident by the slow exchange and reappearance of the peaks. The presence of the bonded calcium ion in the structure of the EHD1 EH domain was also confirmed by the unusual shift of the Gly494 amide proton at 10.64 ppm which is a characteristic signature for calcium binding in EF-hands (Fig. 1A) (Kay et al. 1991). Therefore, in another Aria run, calcium was modeled into the EH domain structure using eight distance restraints between calcium and the coordinating oxygen of the carboxyl group of Asp489, Asp491, Asp493, and Glu500 based on the structure of the EH-2 domain of Eps15. The inclusion of the distance restraints did not violate the NOE restraints from the EH domain suggesting the calcium can be modeled into the structure. The 10 lowest restraint energy structures were evaluated using PROCHECK-NMR (Laskowski et al. 1996) and visualized using MOLMOL software (Koradi et al. 1996). The coordinates of the EHD1 EH domain (residues 401­ 534) in the presence of calcium have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank as entry 2JQ6. The backbone view of the final 10 structures of the EH domain for residues Asp435-Glu534 is displayed in Fig. 2A (residues 401­434 were unfolded and therefore not included) and structural information is presented in Table 1. The structure contains two associated helix-loop-helix motifs with the loops connected by a short antiparallel b-sheet (Fig. 2B, C), similar to the previously solved EH-2 domain structure of Eps15 (Confalonieri and Di Fiore 2002). The position of the first helix Val440-Thr454 is perpendicular to the three other helical domains: Gly464-Lys473,

Asn478-Ala488 and Asp498-Leu512. The antiparallel b-sheet is comprised of loop residues Lys461-Thr463 and Leu495Asp497. The tight packing of the helices is reflected by the large number of long range distances (703). The residues C-terminal to the fourth helix, His515-Glu534, form a number of proline zigzags that position over the third and fourth helical domains to juxtapose both the amino- and carboxyl-termini. Additionally, residues Pro528-Lys530 and Pro523-Leu525 formed a residual helical domain.

Discussion and conclusions We have characterized the structure of the C-terminus of EHD1 (Glu401-Glu534). The C-terminus contains an EH

domain (residues Asp435-Glu534) which is preceded by an unfolded region (residues Glu401-Ile434). The C-terminal EH domain of EHD1 exhibits the same structural characteristics as the N-terminal EH domains previously solved, with two helix-loop-helix motifs connected by a short antiparallel b-sheet, between the loops. EH domains have been identified in a large number of proteins involved in endocytosis or vesicle transport (Confalonieri and Di Fiore 2002). Among the EH domains which have been solved structurally, the EH-2 domain of Eps15 shares 49.5% identity with the EH domain of EHD1

(Fig. 3A) and presents a similar overall structural organization (Fig. 3B, C). The backbone RMSD between both ° lowest energy structures is 1.55 A. One difference appears to be the organization of the first helical domain. The first helical domain of the EHD1 EH domain is composed of residues Val440-The454 with a kink centered around Asp444 (Fig. 2C), whereas the first helix of the Eps15 EH-2 domain (Pro126-Phe136) is relatively straight. The structural difference is the result of a missing proline residue in the first helix of the EHD1 EH domain (Fig. 3A). The side chains of residues Trp122 and Val124 from the N-terminus of the Eps15

EH-2 domain form a pocket with the C-terminal residues His190, Leu187, and Leu209. However, for the EHD1 EH domain residues Trp439 and Val441 to form a similar pocket with residues His506, Leu503, and Leu525, the first helix needs to form a kink positioned at residue Asp444. Previous studies have solved the structure of the Eps15 EH-2 domain with an NPF motif peptide (de Beer et al. 2000). The NPF sequence lies in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the 2nd and 3rd a-helices and directly interacts with residues Gly166, Arg167, Trp169 and Glu170. The Asn side chain from the NPF motif intercalates between the side chains of the Glu170 and Trp169, the side chain of the phenylalanine lies on top of the binding pocket composed of Leu155 and Leu165, and the proline carbonyl group forms a hydrogen bond with a Lys152 e amino proton. The orientation of the residues forming the binding pocket between the EHD1 EH and Eps15 EH-2 domains are similar (e.g. Trp485/169, Leu481/165, and Lys468/152, respectively), in agreement with their strong homology of sequence and structure. Nevertheless, comparison of molecular surfaces of both proteins indicates that the binding pocket of the EHD1 EH domain is narrower and not as deep as that of the Eps15 EH-2 domain (Fig. 3D, E). Moreover, Met471, which corresponds to Leu155 of Eps15, is buried and not accessible to form the hydrophobic pocket. Another difference between the two domains is the surface potential. Previous studies have established a high preference of the Eps15 EH-2 domain for binding NPF motifs as a result of the negative surface charge at the binding pocket that favors hydrogen bonding with the asparagine cNH2 hydrogen atoms (de Beer et al. 2000). However, the EHD1 EH domain exhibits a more positively charged surface potential around the binding pocket as compared to the Eps15 EH-2 domain, due to the replacements of Phe145 ? Lys461, Asp149 ? Ala465, Pro153 ? Lys469, Asn157 ? Lys473, Asp163 ? Thr479, and Glu170 ? Lys486 (Fig. 3F, G). The charge differences, as well as the narrowing of the binding pocket, may change the specificity and nature of the ligand-binding preference for the EHD1 EH domain. The presence of a highly positive surface charge at the binding pocket suggests that the EHD1 EH domain may have a higher affinity for endocytic regulatory proteins containing the DPF motif, over those containing an NPF motif. In summary, we provide the first structural characterization of a C-terminal EH domain. Given our recent discovery that this EH domain binds to phosphatidylinositol moieties, elucidation of the structure of the EHD1 EH domain will shed critical new light on the molecular mechanism by which it interacts with lipids and proteins to regulate endocytic trafficking.
